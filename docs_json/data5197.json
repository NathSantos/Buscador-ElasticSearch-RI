In summary, there is a current global need of a) alternatives to conventional oil derived fuels, especially those obtained from renewable sources, b) reduction of pollutant and carbon emissions from energy and power systems, and c) additives to reduce engine knock. These needs are based on economic and environmental considerations. Part of the effort needed nowdays is centered on understanding the oxidation mechanisms of ethanol and ethanol containing fuels using a combination of simulation and fundamental experiments developed at conditions close to the applications. In order to contribute to this area, this work proposes several detailed kinetic models for pure ethanol and for multicomponent gasoline surrogate mixtures involving ethanol, iso-octane, n-heptane, toluene and di-iso-butylene. This work reports the first detailed kinetic model for ethanol and a five-component gasoline surrogate oxidation at high pressure and intermediate temperatures validated against shock tube ignition delay times.\nHere, the thermal decomposition routes of ethanol are identified and discussed. A low temperature and high pressure oxidation route for ethanol is proposed for modeling pure ethanol and gasoline surrogates. The proposed detailed kinetics models were built by adding and tailoring kinetics submechanisms for each of the components of interest available in the literature. In order to validade the proposed detailed kinetic models, shock tube experiments of ignition delay times were performed at Institute for Combustion and Gasdynamic - IVG at the University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany. The experiments were performed for pure ethanol and for binary and ternary surrogate mixtures involving ethanol, covering a pressure range of 10 bar to 50 bar, temperature range of 690 K to 1220 K, for stoichiometric and lean mixtures of ethanol/air, and gasoline surrogate/air. These conditions approximate those reached in the operation of internal combustion engines in the automotive industry. To the author's knowledge, these are the highest pressures reported so far for ethanol oxidation. The tailored detailed kinetic models were then tuned to the experimental results of ignition delay time by using sensitivity analysis methods. Simulations using the SHOCK 1-D code from CHEMKIN package were performed in order to validate the proposed detailed kinetic models over the experimental conditions, and a good agreement was found.\nKeywords: Ethanol, Gasoline surrogates, Detailed chemical kinetics models, Shock tube ignition delay.\nDesenvolvimento e Aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de Modelos Cin\u00e9ticos Detalhados para Etanol e Combust\u00edveis Hidrocarbonetos Contendo Etanol - Tese - Leonel Rinc\u00f3n Cancino\nix Desenvolvimento e Aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de Modelos Cin\u00e9ticos Detalhados para Etanol e Combust\u00edveis Hidrocarbonetos Contendo Etanol - Tese - Leonel Rinc\u00f3n Cancino\nResumo estendido\nIntrodu\u00e7\u00e3o\nA ind\u00fastria tem investido consider\u00e1veis quantidades de recursos em simula\u00e7\u00f5es num\u00e9ricas nas v\u00e1rias \u00e1reas da engenharia. Usualmente, simula\u00e7\u00f5es num\u00e9ricas fornecem informa\u00e7\u00f5es relevantes as quais s\u00e3o custosas de se obter usando m\u00e9todos experimentais. Isto \u00e9 especialmente ver\u00eddico nas simula\u00e7\u00f5es de processos de combust\u00e3o, nas quais s\u00e3o obtidas informa\u00e7\u00f5es em maior quantidade e de forma mais completa, com um custo relativamente baixo. Esta informa\u00e7\u00e3o pode ent\u00e3o ser usada para o projeto de equipamentos, como, por exemplo, para predizer as distribui\u00e7\u00f5es de temperatura e press\u00e3o, assim como a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies qu\u00edmicas (forma\u00e7\u00e3o/destrui\u00e7\u00e3o) durante a livera\u00e7\u00e3o de energia no interior da c\u00e2mara de combust\u00e3o de um motor a combust\u00e3o interna. Uma vez conclu\u00edda a an\u00e1lise, novos par\u00e2metros referentes ao projeto e opera\u00e7\u00e3o do motor podem ser adotados. O mesmo pode ser dito para o desenvolvimento de misturas de combust\u00edveis para as quais pequenas varia\u00e7\u00f5es de concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de componentes podem resultar numa grande varia\u00e7\u00e3o do desempenho do motor.\nNum processo de combust\u00e3o h\u00e1 v\u00e1rios aspectos que podem ser analizados, dependendo dos objetivos. Por exemplo, algumas vezes \u00e9 importante somente conhecer a temperatura m\u00e1xima e a velocidade de combust\u00e3o. Ent\u00e3o, o modelamento utilizando um mecanismo cin\u00e9tico global \u00e9 usualmente suficiente para representar a cin\u00e9tica de combust\u00e3o. Outras vezes, no entanto, \u00e9 relevante conhecer a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de alguma esp\u00e9cie qu\u00edmica em particular, como, por exemplo, o radical hidroxila. Nestes casos, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio um modelo mais completo para predizer a cin\u00e9tica do processo. Resumindo, para a simula\u00e7\u00e3o da din\u00e2mica de um processo de combust\u00e3o \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio adotar um modelo cin\u00e9tico, e a complexidade deste, depender\u00e1 do detalhamento ou das caracter\u00edsticas das informa\u00e7\u00f5es requeridas.\nA ind\u00fastria automotiva apresenta um cen\u00e1rio particular no qual experimento, modelagem e simula\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00eam o potencial de auxiliar no desenvolvimento de novos conceitos e na otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o do desempenho de motores a combust\u00e3o interna, principalmente quanto aos processos na c\u00e2mara de combust\u00e3o, ao controle de emiss\u00e3o de poluentes e na formula\u00e7\u00e3o de novos combust\u00edveis.\nCombust\u00edveis reais e substitutos de gasolina\nComo mencionado por Westbrook et al. (2005), a import\u00e2ncia da modelagem computacional tem crescido nos campos da ci\u00eancia e engenharia. Atualmente, \u00e9 comum encontrar modelos num\u00e9ricos que representam processos de combust\u00e3o de hidrocarbonetos e, dependendo do foco das an\u00e1lises, s\u00e3o utilizados mecanismos cin\u00e9ticos globais ou detalhados (Griffiths, 1995 e Simmie, 2003). Normalmente, os mecanismos detalhados permitem an\u00e1lises mais aprofundadas e t\u00eam sido utilizados no estudo de hidrocarbonetos puros, ou misturas com poucos componentes. Por exemplo, o conhecido modelo cin\u00e9tico para a oxida\u00e7\u00e3o do isooctano puro proposto por Curran et al. (2002) \u00e9 composto por 857 esp\u00e9cies qu\u00edmicas envolvendo 3606 rea\u00e7\u00f5es elementares. Um fator complicante neste cen\u00e1rio, por\u00e9m, \u00e9 que o n\u00famero de esp\u00e9cies qu\u00edmicas presentes em uma gasolina real pode chegar a centenas, envolvendo hidrocarbonetos saturados e insaturados, incluindo alcanos, ciclo-alcanos, alquenos, ciclo-alquenos, arom\u00e1ticos e outros componentes cuja indentidade e quantidades s\u00e3o usualmente desconhecidas (Metcalfe, 2007). Assim, um modelo cin\u00e9tico detalhado para um combust\u00edvel real envovendo centenas de esp\u00e9cies qu\u00edmcias pode demandar um aumento dram\u00e1tico no n\u00famero de rea\u00e7\u00f5es elementares, tornando a abordagem num\u00e9rica imposs\u00edvel com os recursos computacionais atuais.\nO desenvolvimento de substitutos de gasolina \u00e9 uma das alternativas para possibilitar o desenvolvimento de mecanismos cin\u00e9ticos para combust\u00edveis reais. Um substituto de gasolina consiste em uma mistura com um pequeno n\u00famero de componentes os quais s\u00e3o usados para representar o combust\u00edvel real conservando a previs\u00e3o das principais caracter\u00edsticas deste. Estas caracter\u00edsticas desej\u00e1veis podem incluir, por exemplo, o comportamento da igni\u00e7\u00e3o, a velocidade de queima, a viscosidade, a curva de press\u00e3o de vapor e a emiss\u00e3o de poluentes (Metcalfe, 2007). \u00c9 muito improv\u00e1vel reproduzir todas as caracter\u00edsticas do combust\u00edvel com uma \u00fanica mistura simples. Portanto, a escolha da mistura depende do foco da an\u00e1lise e de crit\u00e9rios estabelecidos pelo analista.\nOs primeiros estudos cin\u00e9ticos da modelagem de n-heptano de Curran et al. (1998) e iso-octano de Curran et al. (2002) cobriram os par\u00e2metros mais usados para qualificar a igni\u00e7\u00e3o de combust\u00edveis. O Research Octane Number - RON e o Motor Octane Number -MON foram os primeiros par\u00e2metros de refer\u00eancia utilizados no desenvolvimento de substitutos de gasolina. As escalas RON e MON s\u00e3o baseadas nos combust\u00edveis prim\u00e1rios de refer\u00eancia - PRF; n-heptano (RON = MON = 0) and iso-octano (RON = MON = 100), e s\u00e3o usados pela ASTM para qualificar a autoigni\u00e7\u00e3o de combust\u00edveis reais, embora os\ncombust\u00edveis reais n\u00e3o sejam compostos somente por n-heptano e iso-octano. A Tabela 1 de Catalu\u00f1a e Silva (2006) lista a composi\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica de um tipo de gasolina no Brasil (sem a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de etanol) em percentagem volum\u00e9trica do volume total. A composi\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica \u00e9 listada de acordo com a quantidade de \u00e1tomos de carbono presentes no grupo hidrocarboneto.\nTabela 1.

No grupo das iso-parafinas o octano \u00e9 predominante. Os ciclo-alcanos com sete \u00e1tomos de carbono representan em torno de 50% do grupo naft\u00eanico. Os alquenos com seis \u00e1tomos de carbono caracterizam o grupo das olefinas e finalmente o tolueno representa em torno de 95% do grupo arom\u00e1tico.\nUma approxima\u00e7\u00e3o para criar um substituto de gasolina que reproduza caracter\u00edsticas de igni\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e9rmica consiste em incluir um ou mais components para cada grupo de hidrocarbonetos presentes na gasolina. Desta forma, cada estrutura molecular de cada grupo hidrocarboneto \u00e9 representada na mixtura. Por exemplo, pode-se sugerir um substituto de gasolina para o tipo de gasolina brasilera da Tabela 1 como sendo: n-octano (or n-heptano) 21%, iso-octano 34,2 %, metil-ciclohexano (or cicloheptano) 14,6%, 1-hexeno (or diisobutileno) 10,7% e tolueno 17,5%.\nEsta aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o pode conduzir a predi\u00e7\u00f5es consistentes com rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 maioria das propriedades de combust\u00e3o do combust\u00edvel real. Para se obter um mecanismo cin\u00e9tico para um substituto de gasolina, subestructuras para cada um dos componentes da mixtura devem ser desenvolvidas (Metcalfe, 2007).\nEstrutura molecular dos componentes dos substitutos de gasoline considerados neste trabalho\nOs substitutos de gasolina propostos neste trabalho s\u00e3o compostos por etanol (hidrocarboneto oxigenado), iso-octano (iso-parafina saturada), n-heptano (n-parafina saturada), tolueno (arom\u00e1tico n\u00e3o saturado) e diisobutileno (olefina n\u00e3o saturada). As esp\u00e9cies qu\u00edmicas escolhidas pertencem as classes de hidrocarbonetos com maior representatividade na composi\u00e7\u00e3o da gasolina real. A Figura 1 mostra as diferentes estruturas moleculares dos hidrocarbonetos escolhidos como substitutos de gasolina neste trabalho.

Thesis - Leonel Rinc\u00f3n Cancino.\nAbstract\nThere are several reasons to the increased interest in ethanol as a fuel. In summary, there is a current global need of a) alternatives to conventional oil derived fuels, especially those obtained from renewable sources, b) reduction of pollutant and carbon emissions from energy and power systems, and c) additives to reduce engine knock. These needs are based on economic and environmental considerations. Part of the effort needed nowdays is centered on understanding the oxidation mechanisms of ethanol and ethanol containing fuels using a combination of simulation and fundamental experiments developed at conditions close to the applications. In order to contribute to this area, this work proposes several detailed kinetic models for pure ethanol and for multicomponent gasoline surrogate mixtures involving ethanol, iso-octane, n-heptane, toluene and di-iso-butylene. This work reports the first detailed kinetic model for ethanol and a five-component gasoline surrogate oxidation at high pressure and intermediate temperatures validated against shock tube ignition delay times.\nHere, the thermal decomposition routes of ethanol are identified and discussed. A low temperature and high pressure oxidation route for ethanol is proposed for modeling pure ethanol and gasoline surrogates. The proposed detailed kinetics models were built by adding and tailoring kinetics submechanisms for each of the components of interest available in the literature. In order to validate the proposed detailed kinetic models, shock tube experiments of ignition delay times were performed at Institute for Combustion and Gasdynamic - IVG at the University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany. The experiments were performed for pure ethanol and for binary and ternary surrogate mixtures involving ethanol, covering a pressure range of 10 bar to 50 bar, temperature range of 690 K to 1220 K, for stoichiometric and lean mixtures of ethanol/air, and gasoline surrogate/air. These conditions approximate those reached in the operation of internal combustion engines in the automotive industry. To the author's knowledge, these are the highest pressures reported so far for ethanol oxidation. The tailored detailed kinetic models were then tuned to the experimental results of ignition delay time by using sensitivity analysis methods. Simulations using the SHOCK 1-D code from CHEMKIN package were performed in order to validate the proposed detailed kinetic models over the experimental conditions, and a good agreement was found.\nDevelopment and Application of Detailed Chemical Kinetics Mechanisms for Ethanol Containing Hydrocarbon Fuels.

Usually, simulations aim at yielding information at lower cost compared to experimental approaches and frequently simulations provide details that are inaccessible in experiments. This is especially true in the simulation of combustion processes, in which more complete information can be acquired from simulations than from experiments with relatively low cost. This information can then be used to the design of combustion devices, for example, to predict the temperature and pressure distribution as well as chemical species formation/depletion during the energy release inside the combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine. Once this information is obtained, new parameters concerning the engine design and operation could be adopted. The same can be said of the development of fuel mixtures where minute variations of components may result in large variations of performance.\nThere are several critical points when simulating combustion processes. For example, sometimes it is only important to know approximately the maximum temperature and global reaction rate in a given process. Then, usually the modeling with a simple global kinetics model suffices to represent the kinetics process. Other times, however, the target is to determine the concentration of a specific chemical species, such as the hydroxyl radical, and in this case a somewhat more refined detailed kinetics model is needed to represent the kinetics process. In summary, the simulation of the dynamics of a combustion process frequently requires some kinetics modeling and the complexity of such modeling grows as more detailed information is pursued.\nThe automotive industry presents a particular environment in which experiment, modeling and computation of the behavior of combustion has the potential to aid in performing engine optimization, develop in-cylinder and after-burn pollutant control and to synthesize new formulations for practical fuels. However, as much as computational resources, numerical methods and chemical knowledge have increased over the last few years, the combustion of practical fuels is still basically investigated using experimental approaches. The reason for this limitation is the inherent complexity of the fuel mixtures.\n1.1\tPractical fuels and gasoline surrogates\nAs mentioned by Westbrook et al. (2005), computer modeling has grown rapidly to play a major role in virtually every field of science and engineering. Today it is common to find numerical models attempting to represent combustion process of single hydrocarbon fuels, and depending on the desired quality or target of the results, one may find global or detailed kinetics mechanisms. In this direction, many researchers have devoted considerable time studying and proposing global and detailed kinetics models (see, for example, references in Griffiths, 1995 and Simmie, 2003) for pure hydrocarbon oxidation. The number of chemical species that can be present in a real gasoline can be, however, in the order of hundreds, involving saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons including alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkenes, cycloalkenes, aromatic, ethers and esters, components whose identity and amounts are often unknown (Metcalfe et al. 2007). The well-known kinetic model for pure iso-octane oxidation of Curran et al. (2002) is composed by 857 chemical species allowing 3606 elementary reactions. A detailed kinetics model for a practical fuel involving a hundred of chemical species in the fuel composition would demand a dramatically increase in the number of elementary reactions, making the problem intractable with current computational capabilities.\nThe development of gasoline surrogates is one of the ways to make the development of chemical kinetics mechanisms for practical fuels tractable. A surrogate fuel consists of a mixture of a small number of components that are used to represent the practical fuel and still predict characteristics of the real fuel. These desirable characteristics may include ignition behavior, burning velocity, viscosity, vaporization, and emission such as carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, soot and nitrogen oxides (Metcalfe et al. 2007). The early kinetics modeling studies of n-heptane by Curran et al. (1998b) and iso-octane by Curran et al. (2002) covering the parameters used to qualified fuel ignition, the Research Octane Number - RON and the Motor Octane Number - MON, were first attempts to develop gasoline fuel surrogates. The RON and MON scales are both based on Primary Reference Fuels - PRF, n-heptane (RON = MON = 0) and iso-octane (RON = MON = 100), and are used to qualify the knocking behavior of real fuels. However, real gasoline fuels are not composed only by n-heptane and iso-octane. In fact, gasoline consists of many different classes of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, including straight and branched alkanes (n-parafins, iso-parafins), cicloalkanes (naphthenes), alkenes (olefins), cicloalkenes (cycloolefins) and aromatics (Aryl compounds). Table 1 from Catalu\u00f1a and Silva (2006) lists the chemical composition of a typical Brazilian base gasoline (without the addition of ethanol) as volume percent of the fuel total volume.\nThe chemical composition is listed according to the carbon atoms present in the hydrocarbon group.\nTable 1. Chemical composition of one kind of Brazilian base gasoline (mol %) (Adapted from Catalu\u00f1a and Silva, 2006).\nSaturated compounds\t__________Unsaturated compounds__________\n\tn-parafins [ % ]\tiso-parafins [ % ]\tnaphthenes [ % ]\tolefins [ % ]\taromatics [ % ]\nC4\t1.07\t***\t***\t0.04\t***\nC5\t5.07\t5.10\t0.65\t0.06\t***\nC6\t5.10\t6.50\t4.30\t10.50\t0.51\nC7\t4.40\t5.20\t7.20\t***\t16.60\nC8\t5.20\t16.65\t3.15\t0.01\t0.41\nC9\t0.12\t0.60\t0.30\t0.07\t***\nC10\t***\t***\t***\t***\t***\nC11\t***\t***\t***\t***\t***\nTotal\t21.0\t34.2\t14.6\t10.7\t17.5\nFrom Table 1 one can see that in the group of n-parafins, the pentanes, hexanes, heptanes and octanes (C5, C6, C7 and C8) compounds are predominant. In the iso-parafins group, the octane is predominant. The cycloalkanes with seven carbon atoms represent about 50% of the naphthenes group. The alkenes with six carbon atoms characterize the olefins group and finally, the toluene represents about 95% of the aromatic group.\nOne approach to surrogate fuels is to include one or more components from each group of hydrocarbons present in gasoline, so that the unique molecular structure of each group is represented. For example, one may suggest a gasoline surrogate for the Brazilian base gasoline from Table 1, as follows: n-octane (or n-heptane) 21%, iso-octane 34.2%, methyl-cyclohexane (or cycloheptane) 14.6%, 1-hexene (or diisobutylene) 10.7% and toluene 17.5%. The di-iso-butylene is intended to represent the hydrocarbon class of alkenes in practical fuels (Metcalfe et al. 2007).\nThis approach may lead to reliable predictions of many of the combustion properties of the practical fuel. In order to obtain a fuel surrogate mechanism, detailed kinetics mechanisms must be developed for each component in the mix compound (Metcalfe et al. 2007).\n1.1.1\tMolecular structure of gasoline surrogates considered in this work\nThe proposed gasoline surrogate is composed of ethanol (oxygenated hydrocarbon), iso-octane (saturated iso-parafin), n-heptane (saturated n-parafin), toluene (unsaturated\naromatic) and diisobutylene (unsaturated olefin). The selected chemical species cover the major hydrocarbon class constituents of the gasoline. Figure 1 shows the different molecular structures of the hydrocarbons selected in this work as components of gasoline surrogates.\nEthanol\nOH\nn-heptane\n2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene\n(diisobutylene)\n2,2,4-trimethyl-pentane\n(iso-octane)\nToluene\nFigure 1.

The objectives can be listed as:\nGeneral objective\nDevelopment and application of detailed chemical kinetics mechanisms for pure ethanol and ethanol containing multi-component gasoline surrogates.\nSpecific objectives\nIn order to reach the general objective, several targets were pursued in both, the numerical and experimental approaches:\n\u2022\tThe development of a detailed kinetics model for ethanol oxidation for the conditions found in internal combustion engines, both in high pressures and intermediate temperatures,\n\u2022\tThe use of a tailoring process to the development of detailed kinetics models for oxidation of multi-component gasoline surrogates including ethanol, iso-octane, n-heptane and toluene,\n\u2022\tThe measurement of ignition delay times in shock tube as an experimental technique to provide temperature and pressure dependent data to develop and test detailed chemical kinetics models,\n\u2022\tThe use of computational tools as sensitivity analysis for improvement of detailed kinetics models.\n1.3\tThesis organization\nThis manuscript is structured in five chapters, beginning in chapter 1 with the objectives and contributions.\nIn chapter 2, the basic theories about the different areas involved in this work are reviewed. The chapter starts with a review of the numerical modeling of combustion process and the set of equations for laminar and RANS turbulent models are reviewed. Then, the structure of macroscopic chemical kinetics models are presented with emphasis to the submechanisms for small hydrocarbons, ethanol and primary reference fuels. The fundamentals of chemical kinetics mechanism applied to hydrocarbon oxidation are discussed. The sensitivity analysis of chemical kinetics models is presented as a computational tool for optimization process of large chemical schemes and an extension of this methodology developed in this work is explained. The fundamentals of shock tubes are reviewed in two sections, one describing the shock tube experiments and the other presenting the shock wave theory involving only two topics; the physics of shock waves and the modeling of the CHEMKIN SHOCK package of the flow behind a shock wave. The simulation of compressible flow in shock tubes is commented in two sections; one on\ninteraction of propagating shock wave and turbulence and the other on shock wave and boundary layer interaction in shock tubes.\nIn chapter 3, the experimental approach used in this work is described. The chapter starts with the description of the High Pressure Shock Tube at University of Duisburg-Essen and then follows describing the mixture preparation and measurement procedures. Then the results of ignition delay times from all experiments performed in this study; Ethanol pure, Gasoline Surrogate A (ethanol / iso-octane - 25% / 75% by liquid volume), and Gasoline Surrogate B (ethanol / iso-octane / n-heptane / toluene - 40% / 38.7% / 10.2% / 12% by liquid volume) are presented and discussed.\nIn chapter 4, the simulation models adopted in this work are presented. The chapter starts with the description of the tailoring process of the kinetics models adopted. The proposed detailed kinetics model for ethanol oxidation is explained and the results of the validation against the measurements are presented. The numerical results for the multicomponent gasoline surrogate models; GS-A (ethanol / iso-octane / n-heptane), GS-B (ethanol / iso-octane / n-heptane / toluene), GS-C (ethanol / iso-octane / n-heptane), GS-D (iso-octane / n-heptane / toluene) and GS-E (ethanol / iso-octane / n-heptane / di-isobutylene) are also presented.\nFinally, in chaper 5, conclusions and recommendations for future work involving ethanol kinetics and gasoline surrogates are presented, followed by references and appendices.\nChapter 2: Background\n2.1\tNumerical modeling of combustion processes\nThe modeling of chemically reacting flow and heat transfer demand the solution of\nconservation equations for mass, momentum, energy and mass of chemical species. This set of conservation equations has to be solved with a chemical kinetics mechanism which describes the transformation of reactants to products. The development of this set of conservation equations is available elsewhere (Kuo, 1986; Peters, 2000; Poinsot e Veynante, 2001).\n2.1.1\tTransport equations for laminar chemically reacting fluid flow\nThe modeling of reacting fluid flow in the continuum regime is based on the conservation equations that can be written as (Poisont and Veynante, 2001):\nMass:\n+\n[1]\nMomentum:\nd\td\tdp\tdrij\npu +\tpuu. =-\t+\t+ P/\ndt\tj\tdxi\tj\tdXj\tdxi\tk\nk=1\n[2]\nEnergy:\n[3]\nMass of chemical species k:\ndYk dx,\n[4]\nIn equations [1], [2], [3] and [4] Vki represents the diffusion velocity, assumed to be proportional only to the gradient of the mass fraction, i.e., modeled by Fick's Law for a multi-component mixture, fk f represents the body force f acting over the chemical species k in the direction i, Q is the source term of volumetric energy generation by other mechanisms not related to combustion and phase change, qi represents the conduction heat transfer flux, modeled by Fourier's Law with an additional contribution from the mass diffusion, represents the viscous stress tensor, modeled assuming a Newtonian fluid, Dp/Dt is the material derivate of the pressure p, X represents the molecular thermal conductivity of the mixture, Yk represents the mass fraction of chemical species k, Dk represents the Fick diffusion coefficient of species k in the mixture, p represents the density, u represents the component i of the velocity u, h represents the enthalpy, p represents the dynamic viscosity and d)k represents the reaction rate of species k calculated using a chemical kinetics mechanism.\nThe multi-component mass diffusion modeling by Fick's Law may result in problems of global mass balance. Some techniques are used to guarantee the mass balance, and these are reviewed by Poinsot and Veynante (2001). Bird et al. (1954) and Kuo (1986) reviewed the fundamental models for transport properties in mixtures.\nIn order to obtain the reaction rate of species k, the reactions of the kinetics model can be represented as:\nN\tN\nk=1\tk=1\n1,...,M,\n[5]\nwhere N is the number of chemical species, M is the number of chemical reactions, v\u2019k j and v\"k j, are the stoichiometric coefficients of species k, in the reaction j, in the reactants side and in the products side, respectively.\nNaming Wk the molar mass of species k, the mass conservation requires\nN\tN\nk=1\tk=1\nN\n[6]\nwhere\nk=1\n[7]\nThe reaction rate for species k is given by the sum of its production or depletion rates in each chemical reaction forming the kinetics model,\nM\tM\n\u00e1 k = E k k, j = Wk E vk, jQj\twith\n[8]\nwhere Qj is the progress rate of the chemical reaction j.\nMass conservation requires that the sum of the reaction rates of all chemical species is zero, i.e.,\n[9]\nUsing the Law of Mass Action, the progress rate of reaction j is a function of both forward and reverse rates of reactions with chemical kinetics constants kf j and kb j respectively;\nn (nY S'J\tN (nY S'\u2019J\nQj=k,,jnp] -kbjU^ I \u2022\tI'\u00ae]\nk=1 k Wk )\tk=1 k Wk )\nwhere the ratio pYk/Wk is the molar concentration of species k.\nDetermining these rate constants, kf j and kb j, constitutes a central problem in combustion modeling. For elementary reactions, they are modeled by using an extended form of Arrhenius law,\n[11]\nexponent for reaction j and is the universal gas constant. The ratio of activation energy to universal gas constant also can be represented as an activation temperature, Ta j. The description of kinetics models will be explored in section 2.2.\nThe system of conservation equations is closed with the fluid equation of state p = p(T, p) and caloric equations of state for the calculation of specific enthalpy and entropy. For ideal gases, these can be obtained from the integration of specific heat functions expressed in polynomial form (NASA Glenn thermodynamic database). This set of equations is used to solve reacting fluid flow in laminar regime and is the same used in the Direct\nNumerical Simulation - DNS for turbulent flow, using mesh resolution and time steps according to the DNS technique.\nAlternative methodologies not involving DNS are the Large Eddy Simulation - LES and Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes - RANS approaches. In the next section, the equations used in the RANS models are reviewed.\n2.1.2\tTransport equations for turbulent combustion by using RANS\nIntroducing the concept of Favre averaging (Favre, 1969) of the conservation equations, the averaged conservation equations become:\nMass:\nMomentum:\nEnergy:\ndp d\nH(\u2014\"\u2018 ) =0\u2019\ndphs\td t p \\ \u2014 Dp d\n\u2014+\t( puh ) = (ot +\t+\ndt\tdxt\t1 s> T Dt\tdxt\ni I dxr\n___A\tdir\td d N\td\n\u2014.\u25a0h-\\+Tt -y- -U- p\u2014w,\nk=1\nDp dp\tdp dp _ dip\tdp\n=\t+ U\t= + U\t+ Ui\nDt dt\tdxi dt\t<~x.\n\u2022>\nMass of chemical species:\ndpYk\td / \u2014 ~\\\np\tx p) =\nd dxt\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\ni\n1 dx\u00a1\nj i\nd N\n5 ,k\n\nJ\nIn equations [13], [14] and [15], terms involving means of fluctuation appear as a result of the averaging process. These terms, pu\"u\", pu\u2019^h\" e pu\u2019Y\", were grouped with the diffusive terms and require a treatment for the closure of the system of equations. The terms -pu\u201du\u201d are called Reynolds stresses. Wilcox (1994) presents the derivation of an equation for the Reynolds stresses, starting with the six stress components and showing the difficulties related to a rigorous treatment of these terms.\nThe last term in equation [15], demands special attention. This term represents the time-average of the reaction rate of chemical species k. It must be observed that, in general,\nthe average value of the reaction rate is not equal to the reaction rate calculated using the mean values of temperature and mass fraction, because the fluctuations can be expressive, when compared to the mean values.\nThe numerical solution of the last set of equations gives the numerical response a combustion process. Depending on the level of the phenomenological complexity allowed in the numerical simulation the numerical solution using current computational resources may not be possible or tractable. Figure 2 presents a diagram of the computational viability as related to the phenomenological complexity in the numerical simulation of a combustion process.\nNumeric simulation of a combustion process\nFigure 2. Computational viability related to the phenomenological complexity in the numerical simulation of a combustion process\nThe first stage of the computational difficulty in Figure 2 is related to the solution of the momentum equations and global mass conservation; interpolation functions, pressurevelocity coupling, and other numerical factors. The second stage is associated to the flow regime. A great part of the combustion applications are in turbulent regime, this aspect demanding the choice of a turbulence model.\nThe third level of computational difficulty is related to the reactive flow regime. This involves the solution of the energy conservation equation and the solution of a set of (N - 1) conservation equations of the N chemical species present in the combustion process. The interaction of turbulence and chemistry gives the fourth increase in the computational complexity. Different approaches have been used in order to represent this interaction such as Laminar finite-rate, Eddy dissipation, Laminar finite-rate/Eddy dissipation and EDC Eddy Dissipation Concept, to cite only the commonly available in commercial CFD packages. They are not, by far, general and much development is needed. The fifth increment in the computational complexity is related to the kinetics model used to represent the formation/depletion of chemical species. The chemical kinetics model employed plays an important role in the computational viability of a numerical simulation. Figure 3 presents schematically the influence of the kinetics model (global or detailed), on the computational viability for a numerical simulation of a combustion process.\nKinetics model\nPhenomenological complexity Number of chemical species\nPhenomenological complexity Number of chemical species\nFigure 3. Influence of the kinetics model on the computational time, computational resources and viability of a numerical simulation of a combustion process.\nWhen a global kinetics model (reduced model, small number of chemical species) is chosen the simulation becomes viable using current computational resources including many phenomenological complexities of the real process. When a detailed kinetics model is selected, the numerical simulation viability is limited to a discrete number of chemical species and a limited description of the phenomenological complexities.\n2.2\tChemical kinetics models\nThe chemical kinetics models feed the reaction rate term in equation [10]. The description of chemical kinetics, depending on the level of complexity, can be classified as global, reduced or detailed. The difference between detailed or semi-detailed mechanisms consists in the number of simplifications, such as quasi steady-state and equilibrium concentrations of intermediate species, assumed when arriving at the final set of reactions. This results in a smaller number of chemical species and chemical reactions in reduced schemes, when compared to detailed mechanisms for the same set of reactants. Therefore, the number of equations of conservation of mass of chemical species required to describe the combustion problem can be significantly smaller when using global or reduced chemical kinetics models.\n2.2.1\tGlobal kinetics models\nFrequently, the target of the numerical solution of a given industrial application is only a reduced set of characteristic parameters of the combustion process, for example, the temperature, the pressure, the concentration of one or two chemical species, or a global fuel burning rate. Depending on the accuracy required, this small set of parameters can be predicted using global kinetics models. Since this result in a small number of chemical species involved in the problem, the solution of the set of conservation equations is relatively fast and the computational time in the numerical simulations is then reduced.\nGlobal kinetics models are limited to a small number of chemical reactions (steps) and species. It is very common to find global models of one or two steps involving three or four chemical species for the most common hydrocarbons used in the industry. Westbrook and Dryer (1981) presented a database of reduced kinetics models for the combustion of CH4, C2H6, C3H8, C4H10, C5H12, C6H14, C7H16, C8H18, C9H20, C10H22, CH3OH, C2H5OH, C6H6, C7H8, C2H4, C3H6 and C2H2 with air. They present the global reaction rate in the form:\nkv = ATP exp(-Ea IWT)[Fuel]a[Oxidizer]b.\t[16]\nIn equation [16], A is the pre-exponential factor, P is the temperature exponent, Ea is the activation energy, is the universal gas constant, [Fuel] and [Oxidizer] represent the concentrations of fuel and oxidizer with its concentration exponents a and b respectively.\nWestbrook and Dryer (1981) provide a table with parameters A, fi, Ea, a, b for single-step and two-steps mechanisms. Commercial CFD codes, such as FLUENT and ANSYS-CFX have implemented global kinetics models for several practical fuels of common use in the industry. Global kinetics models make it possible the numerical simulation of reacting flows in complex geometries with the present widely available computational resources.\n2.2.2\tDetailed kinetics models\nDetailed kinetics models provide more in-depth information into the time and spatial evolution of the concentration of chemical species in a combustion system. A well structured detailed kinetics model must be able to describe all the stages of the kinetics process, beginning with the pyrolysis/thermal decomposition of the fuel, followed by the total or partial depletion of the fuel, formation and consumption of intermediate species and finally describing the formation of saturated combustion products.\n2.2.2.1\tFundamentals of the chemical kinetics mechanisms of oxidation of hydrocarbons\nThe oxidation of hydrocarbons proceeds either by hydrogen atom abstraction or by cleavage of C-C bonds at primary or secondary carbon atoms. In the case of aliphatic alcohol hydrocarbons, the hydroxyl group plays a very important role for the oxidation and as a third pathway the cleavage of the C-O bond can occur. Any of the three paths proceeds after a temperature activated perturbation of the energy field of the molecule and can proceed either intramolecular (isomerization) giving several sub-structures or as a result of collision with active radical species. Independently of the case, reaction mechanisms show several characteristic properties. Usually, reaction mechanisms in combustion follow a chain process composed by initiation, propagation, branching and termination reactions. As an example, we can take the mechanism for the ignition process of the hydrogen-oxygen system.\nTable 3 shows the set of the most important reactions with respect to the low pressure high temperature ignition in the hydrogen-oxygen system. The initiation reaction produces active radical species. The propagation reactions produce the same number of radicals as are consumed. The chain branching reactions produce more active radical species than are consumed. Finally, the chain termination reactions lead active to stable species, at the vessel surface (R5) or in the gas phase (R6).\nTable 3.

Methane was the first hydrocarbon analyzed because of its simplicity. The first detailed kinetics model for high temperature oxidation of methane dealt with the methane reaction as an H-atom abstraction sequence from methane, forming methyl radical (CH3), with posterior conversion to formaldehyde (CH2O), and then to formyl radical (HCO) and carbon monoxide (CO) and finally oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2). This kinetics scheme for methane was discarded, because it was soon verified that CH3 can recombine to ethane C2H6 and finally form H2O and CO2 (Westbrook et al., 2005). Afterward, a very important conclusion was obtained: A detailed kinetics model can be structured in a hierarchical form, taking as base the kinetics of small hydrocarbons and completing the kinetics model with additional reactions for the bigger chemical species. Figure 4 shows a schematic representation of the hierarchy of the kinetics model for hydrocarbons oxidation.\nAs an example of a detailed kinetics model, in the following, the detailed kinetics model for the H2/O2 system is presented. The model presented is a simplification of the first version of the GRIMech 3.0 mechanism and allows 28 elementary reactions among 9 chemical species.\nFigure 4. Hierarchy of kinetics models for hydrocarbons oxidation (adapted from Warnatz et al., 1999).\nThe kinetics data are presented in the Arrhenius form:\nkf = AT \u2019 exp\t.\t[17]\nas described in equation [11]. In the detailed model, the reaction rate in the forward direction is calculated using equation [17] above, while the reaction rate in the backward direction is calculated from chemical equilibrium using the relation:\n[C1HD1\u00cd\tK\tkf\n[A]a [B]b\teq\tkb\n[18]\nIn equation [18], [I] represent the molar concentration of chemical species i in (kmol/m3) and Keq is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant of the reaction expressed in molar concentration units.\nThe Arrhenius parameters of the backward reaction can be specified in the mechanism, and this could be used to calculate the reverse reaction rate instead of the chemical equilibrium relation.\nTable 4 shows the adequate form to write detailed kinetics models in order to be correctly interpreted by the pre-processor of CHEMKIN or CANTERA codes.\nThe representation of elementary reactions involving a third body \u201cM\u201d, as reaction 1 in Table 4, is:\nO+O+M<=>O2+M\nH2/ 2.40/ H2O/15.40/ AR/ 0.83/\nThis notation indicates different efficiencies of chemical species during collision as a third body. Using this notation, the values for the pre-exponential coefficient in the Arrhenius equation is multiplied by the constant provided, depending of the third body \u201cM\u201d. In the example above, if the third body \u201cM\u201d is H2 (hydrogen) the pre-exponential coefficient would be 2.4 times the specified value in the table for this reaction. If the third body \u201cM\u201d is AR (argon) its value would be 0.83 times the specified value in the table. Usually, molecules with a larger number of internal degrees of freedom are able to exchange a larger spectrum of energy levels (quantized) and therefore present higher efficiencies.\nTable 4.

Figure 5 shows the behavior of the reaction rate for unimolecular reactions as a function of the reduced pressure, pr, by using the Lindemann mechanism and RRKM theory. It shows also the empiric approximation developed by Troe et al. (1982).\nFigure 5. Reaction rate for unimolecular reactions, Lindemann mechanism, RRKM theory and empiric Fcent factor developed by Troe et al. 1982.\nThe behavior of the reaction rate of uni-molecular reactions can be modeled using the form proposed by Troe (CHEMKIN GAS PHASE KINETICS core manual apude Troe et al., 1982). An example is given by reaction 11 (from Table 4):\nOH+OH(+M)<=>H2O2(+M)\nLOW / 2.300E+18 -0.900 -1700.00/\nTROE/ 0.7346 94.00 1756.00 5182.00/\nH2/ 2.00/ H2O/ 6.00/ AR/ 0.70/\nThe word \u201cLOW\u201d indicates the low pressure limit, followed by the three numbers corresponding to A^ n0 and Eo, in the Arrhenius equation:\nko = 4,F\u2018exp\t\u25a0\t[19]\nEquation [19] is used by the program (CHEMKIN or CANTERA) in order to calculate the reaction rate for the low pressure range. Analogously, the Arrhenius parameters for the \u201cHIGH\u201d pressure limit Ax, nx e Ex are provided and used in the expression\nk, = A,T-- exp (-Ed,\t[20]\nfor the high pressure limit. Once both the low and high pressure limits are provided the program calculates the reaction rate for the required pressure using the equation\nk = k\n11 + Pr )\n[21]\nwhere the reduced pressure, pr , is calculated as:\n[22]\nr\n\nwith [M] as the mixture concentration.\nIn equation [21], the function F can be defined by using two forms: Troe (CHEMKIN\nGAS PHASE KINETICS Core Manual apude Troe et al., 1982), or SRI approximation (CHEMKIN GAS PHASE KINETICS Core Manual apude Stewart et al., 1989).\nThe Troe form is\nlog (F ) =\nlog (Pr ) + c n - d [log (Pr) + c ]\nlog (Fcent) ,\n[23]\n1 +\nwhere\nc = -0.4-0.67log(Fcent) , n = 0.75 -1.27 log (Fcent) , d = 0.14 ,\nand\n[24]\nWhen using this form, the four numbers listed after the word \u201cTROE\u201d below the reaction in the detailed kinetics model, are the four parameters a, T*** , T*e T** of equation [24]\nThe second form to define the function F is by using the SRI approximation, defined by the expression\nF = da exp (~bT) + exp (~TC)\tTe ,\t[25]\nwhere\nX =\n1\n1 + log2 (P)\n[26]\nIn the detailed kinetics model used in this work, only two reactions in the Konnov model use the SRI approximation for the calculation of the pressure dependent unimolecular reaction rates. The others reactions in the Konnov model are assumed to be non-pressure dependent.\nFrequently, reactions taken as elementary are not in fact elementary in a collision sense. This is the case of the pressure sensitive unimolecular reactions discussed above. There are reactions that follow different reaction rates in low and high temperatures (Konnov, 2005). The word \u201cDUPLICATE\u201d in the Chemkin format allows the possibility of modeling these reactions in detailed kinetics models. When this word is found, the chemical reaction rate calculated by two or more sets of Arrhenius parameters for the same reaction are added.\nThe nitrogen chemistry is added when air is used as oxidizer. In this case, the H2/CO/N2 kinetics sub-structure is the starting point for building the desired detailed kinetics model (Simmie, 2003). For the combustion of hydrocarbons, the size of the kinetics structure grows as the number of carbon atoms in the molecule increase. For example, the well known detailed kinetics model for methane, the GRIMech 3.0, is composed by 325 elementary reactions among 53 chemical species. In the case of the iso-octane oxidation, the detailed kinetics model developed by Curran et al. (2002) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is composed by 3606 elementary reactions among near 857 chemical species.\nFigure 6 shows an estimate of the evolution in the number of chemical species and elementary reactions for the appropriate description of the detailed kinetics model as a function of the number of carbon atoms in the fuel molecule, for combustion of alkanes with\nair. In the range of number of carbon atoms analyzed, a linear growth of the number of elementary reactions and chemical species is observed, reaching an estimated value of 1250 chemical species and 4600 elementary reactions for a hydrocarbon containing 16 carbon atoms in the molecule.\nFor iso-octane, Warnatz's predictions in Figure 6 indicate that a detailed kinetics model containing 500 chemical species forming 1500 elementary reactions should be sufficient to the correct description of the iso-octane oxidation. Note that the kinetics model developed by Curran et al. (2002) for iso-octane contains about twice this number of chemical species and elementary reactions. Table 5 presents a list (not intended to be exhaustive) of detailed kinetics models compiled from the open literature and some of their characteristics.\n4\t5\t6\t7\t8\t9\t10\t11\t12\t13\t14\t15\t16\t17\nCarbon atoms number\nFigure 6.

In this work, the detailed kinetics model from Konnov\n(2000) was used as a kernel for the sub-kinetics database for combustion of hydrocarbons containing up to three carbon atoms in the molecular structure. The Konnov's detailed kinetics model has been validated and tested numerically for several experimental conditions covering a wide range of pressures, temperatures and stoichiometric compositions, for several saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. Cancino (2004), Cancino and Oliveira (2005a, 2006) and Cancino et al. (2007, 2008a, 2008b, 2009a, 2009b, 2009c) presents the performance of the Konnov's detailed kinetics model in predicting reaction properties in perfectly stirred reactors and shock tubes for methane, acetylene, propane and ethanol.\nTable 5.

Natarajan and Bhaskaran (1981) reported the first detailed kinetics model for the high-temperature oxidation of ethanol containing 56 elementary reactions, including the bimolecular decomposition reaction C2H5OH + M CH2OH + CH3 + M, in other words, proposing the C-C cleavage of ethanol. Validation against experimental data of ignition delay time in a shock tube at pressures of 1.0 and 2.0 bar and temperatures between 1300 K to 1700 K resulted in good agreement with respect to the pressure dependence. The numerical model at pressure of 1.0 bar overestimates the IDT in about 13%, while for pressure of 2.0 bar the model underestimates the IDT in about 13%. Borisov et al. (1989, 1992) reported a second detailed kinetics model for the high-temperature ignition of ethanol involving 94 elementary reactions. This kinetics mechanism was built starting from the Natarajan and Bhaskaran model, adding reactions that describe the pyrolysis of ethanol and some reactions representing the thermal oxidation by active radicals, not considered in Natarajan's model. The model was validated against experimental results of ignition delay time in shock tubes for stoichiometric, lean and rich compositions at pressure of 1.0 bar.\nIn the nineties, Marinov (1999) developed a comprehensive model for the high-temperature ethanol oxidation. The detailed kinetics model of Marinov is composed by 383 elementary reactions among 57 chemical species. It included an accurate kinetics data-set for ethanol oxidation, reaction routes involving H abstraction, C-C and C-O cleavage were proposed and computational chemistry methods were used in order to determine the Arrhenius parameters. This mechanism was validated against experimental results of ignition delay time in shock tube, laminar flame speed in counterflow twin flame and chemical species concentrations in jet-stirred reactor. In the case of ignition delay time in shock tube, for mixtures with 1.25% C2H5OH, 3.75% O2, and 95.0% Argon, (equivalence ratio f =1.0), at 3.5 bar, the Marinov detailed kinetics model overestimates the global activation energy in about ~31 kJ/mol, when compared to the measurements from Dunphy and Simmie (1991) (Ea ~ 130 kJ/mol). In general, good agreement was found with all measurements. The Marinov model was tested for the temperature range of 1300 K to 1700 K, pressures of 1.0 bar to 4.6 bar and stoichiometries of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0.\nMore recently, Saxena and Williams (2007) reported a kinetics model with 288 elementary reactions among 57 chemical species. This model is about 100 elementary reactions smaller than Marinov's and also involves the nitrogen oxidation chemistry. It was\nvalidated against experimental results of ignition delay time in a shock tube at high temperatures (1300-1700 K) and pressures of 1.0 and 2.0 bar for stoichiometric, lean and rich ethanol/O2/Ar mixtures. The Saxena model was also validated with laminar burning velocity data from Egolfopulos et al. (1992).\nNumerical studies on ethanol decomposition using computational chemistry have also been reported, which have been useful in completing the gaps on thermodynamic and chemical kinetics parameters as well as in pointing out important reactions and reactions with a very high reaction barrier. Marinov (1999) used Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory to analyze the multichannel decomposition of ethanol. In this study, the reaction rate parameters of the thermal decomposition of ethanol at high temperatures, involving new degradation routes, such as H abstraction, were determined, this new data allowed to increase the accuracy of the kinetics modeling, the numerical model of Marinov, when compared to the experimental data of Natarajan and Bhaskaran (1981) at pressure of 1.0 bar, underestimates the IDT in about ~3.3 %, For pressure of 2.0 bar, the model also underestimates the IDT in about ~9.4%, which can be considered a good comparison.\nRecently, Li et al. (2004) found, by using computational chemistry and taking into account all the routes (channels) of decomposition of ethanol, that Marinov's model underestimates the production rate of H2O and C2H4 as well as the overall ethanol consumption. This led to the proposal of a new set of Arrhenius parameters for the decomposition reactions; C2H5OH = C2H4 + H2O and C2H5OH = CH3 + CH2OH. Finally, Lin et al. (2002, 2003 and 2004) published the most recent kinetics data obtained from computational chemistry for the thermal oxidation of ethanol. A new kinetics database was provided, thus allowing for the prediction of the thermal decomposition of ethanol and ethanol-radical reactions. High barrier reactions are detected and critical reactions are identified. Table 6 summarizes this overview of the experimental and numerical results of ethanol oxidation available in the literature.\n2.2.5\tDetailed kinetics model for Primary Reference Fuels.\nPrimary reference fuels (PRF) n-heptane and iso-octane are used to define the octane reference scale for fully blended gasolines. n-Heptane is a reactive straight-chain paraffin while iso-octane is a less reactive branched paraffin (Curran et al., 1998). Each fuel exhibits richly complex chemistry. At high temperatures, fuel decomposition reactions tend to dominate the combustion process, whereas at low temperatures, the chemistry is dominated\nby addition of alkyl radicals to O2 and subsequent isomerization reactions. The Curran's PRF model was based on previous detailed kinetics models developed at LLNL for n-heptane, isooctane, n-butane and other pure hydrocarbon fuels.

(1998) model include the following:\n\u2022\tUnimolecular fuel decomposition,\n\u2022\tH atom abstraction from the fuel,\n\u2022\tAlkyl radical decomposition,\n\u2022\tAlkyl radical + O2 to produce olefin + HO2 directly,\n\u2022\tAlkyl radical isomerization,\n\u2022\tAbstraction reactions from olefin by OH, Hl, O and CH3,\n\u2022\tAddition of radical species to olefin,\n\u2022\tAlkenyl radical decomposition,\n\u2022\tOlefin decomposition,\n\u2022\tAddition of alkyl radicals to O2,\n\u2022\tR + R' O2 = R' O + RO,\n\u2022\tAlkyl peroxy radical isomerization (RO2 = QOOH ),\n\u2022\tRO2 + HO3 = RO2 H + O2,\n\u2022\tRO2 + H2O2 = RO2 H + HO3,\n\u2022\tRO2 + CH3O2 = RO + CHO + O2,\n\u2022\tRO2 + R' O2 = RO + R' O + O2,\n\u2022\troh = ro+(Oh ,\n\u2022\tQOOH = cyclic ether + OH (cyclic ether formation via cyclisation of diradical),\n\u2022\tQOOH = olefin + HO..

All of these reaction groups are described with details in Curran et al. (2002).\nFrom the description above, the treatment of binary mixtures of pure components is already fairly complex and the complexity increases largely as the number of components increases. In this work, the detailed kinetics model for PRF of Curran et al. (1998) was adopted as kernel for the tailoring process of the multi-component gasoline surrogates models proposed in chapter 4.\n2.3\tSensitivity analysis as a method for analysis and optimization of kinetics models\nSensitivity analysis is a computational tool widely used for optimization of detailed kinetics models (Cancino et al., 2009b; Metcalfe et al., 2007, Andrae et al., 2005; Brezinsky et. al., 2005; Dagaut et al., 2002; Glarborg et al., 2001; Dunphy et al., 1991; Egolfopoulos et al., 1992; Andrae, 2008; Andrae et al., 2008; Griffiths, 1995) since it gives information about the more important (sensitive) reactions of a kinetics scheme. The methodology can be applied to the time-evolution of the chemical species of a reactive system as found, for example, in the autoignition of reactive mixtures in perfectly stirred reactors. The target in the sensitivity analysis has to be at least one of the dependent variables involved in the problem, for example, sensitivity on temperature, concentration or reaction rate of a chemical species. Independent variables can not be defined as target for sensitivity analysis. For example, it is not possible to perform a sensitivity analysis on ignition delay time of thermal oxidation of hydrocarbons.\nWhen the target is an independent variable of the system, the methodology is based on an indirect approach. For thermal ignition, for example, it is known that the hydroxyl radical is a very important chemical species affecting both the fuel depletion and the temperature increase. Then, to study the prediction of ignition delay time, the target can be fixed as the sensitivity on the concentration of the hydroxyl radical. In the next sections, the fundamentals of the sensitivity analysis are reviewed. Additionally, an extension of this method, developed and applied in this work, is presented.\n2.3.1\tSensitivity Analysis.\nThe major purpose of the sensitivity analysis is to determine the local performance of a system of equations when there is a perturbation in a selected parameter. In a kinetics context, the response of the system is examined when the Arrhenius parameters of the kinetics mechanism are changed, for a set of boundary conditions. The response is usually measured\nrelative to the magnitude of the changes that are introduced. The magnitude of the sensitivity coefficient for a particular rate constant is related to the influence on the behavior of that particular reaction, i.e., the sensitivity analysis represents a local analysis in a reactive system. The mathematical approach of sensitivity analysis is presented following Griffiths (1994).\nConsider the non-linear mass conservation equation\n= f (k,c) , , = 1,...,N\t[27]\nat\nin which k and c are the rate coefficient and species concentration vectors, respectively and N is the number of chemical species. In order to generate a solution for equation [27], it is necessary to specify the component values for the vector k. The concentration vector c is a function of the parameter vector as well as time c(k,t). A first order sensitivity coefficient with respect to species ci may be defined as\n5c\tc,. (k- +5k., t) - c. (k-, t)\n(k, t) = -\t-\t,\t[28]\n5\u2014\t^kj\nand represents the change in a species concentration ci at time t owing to a change in the jth rate parameter k- (or the jth component of any parameter vector, in general). The gradient and its second order counterpart,\n5)\n5 )2\n1\n[29]\nconvey quantitative information about the solution in the vicinity of the operating point. The linearized response of the sensitivity with respect to time throughout the reaction data set is given by\nd 5c, dt 5 kj\n[30]\nin which Ju is the Jacobian matrix defined as\n5f\n5cl\n[31]\nEquation [30] must be solved by numerical integration in order to obtain deviations in ci(t) as a result of the changes in k. If the ordinary differential equations describing the species concentration of time are stiff, as is normally the case in combustion reactions, then the\nsensitivity equations are likely to be difficult and computationally expensive to solve. Once the sensitivity coefficients have been obtained, they are usually normalized using the\nexpression\n_ \u00bf[lnc)]\n\" _&lt;ln]\n[32]\nThe order of magnitude of oij gives the relative importance of the jth reaction in influencing the concentration of species i at time t. Setting each k to zero and calculating the corresponding sensitivities, coij indicates the significance of the jth reaction. If all coefficients oij for the jth reaction are very small, in relation to the higher value, then the jth reaction may be regarded to be unimportant. Conversely, if one or more of the normalized sensitivities toij are large, then the jth reaction is said to be determining for the ith species.\nSensitivity Coefficient for the OH Radical\nFigure 7. Typical bar diagram for sensitivity analysis at a specific elapsed time.\nFigure 7 shows a typical bar diagram of sensitivity analysis applied on the Konnov (2000) detailed kinetics model. In the diagram, it is possible to determine the more important reactions for the production and consumption of radical hydroxyl, just at ignition time.\n2.3.2\tIntegral form of the sensitivity analysis\nThe sensitivity coefficients in a sensitivity analysis, as described above, may be obtained for each time-step of a transient solution. For example, in a simulation of thermal oxidation the output file from CHEMKIN contains the sensitivity coefficients of all reactions for all time-steps, and thus can be analyzed as a function of time-step, as shown in Figure 8.\n<L> Ch 3\ncd Ch\n<L> Qh\nH&lt;+H o\nQ\nCCH\n<L>\nO\nQ\ncz>\nGO\n5.5 q\n5.0-\n4.5-\n4.0-\n3.5-\n3.0-\n2.5-\n2.0-\n1.5-\n1.0-\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5-\n-1.0-\n-1.5-\n-2.0-\n-2.5-\n-3.0\n----RxR1 ----RxR2\n-\tRxR3\n----RxR4 ----RxR5 ----RxR6\nRxR7\n-\tRxR8\n-\tRxR9\n----RxRn\nTime step\nFigure 8. Example of sensitivity output file for a reactive system showing the sensitivities of reactions Ri on the temperature at each elapsed time.\nThe analysis of graphics as Figure 8 is relatively easy when the number of reactions forming the system is relatively small. However, when the kinetics scheme is large and the number of important reactions is substantial it is very difficult to extract useful information from such diagrams. In these cases, it is necessary the use of computational tools for automatic data post-processing.\nIt is common to find in the literature results of sensitivity analysis on temperature or chemical species in the form of Figure 7, showing the results at a specific elapsed time of a thermal oxidation process, for example, just at the ignition time (see ref. Cancino and Oliveira\n2006; Metcalfe et al., 2007, Andrae et al., 2005; Brezinsky et. al., 2005; Dagaut et al., 2002; Glarborg et al., 2001; Dunphy et al., 1991; Egolfopoulos et al., 1992; Andrae, 2008; Andrae et al., 2008). The reactions are indentified at the ignition time and their Arrhenius parameters are altered or optimized in order to better reproduce the experimental data. However, when the analysis at a single elapsed time is used, although some reasonable results may emerge, a large amount of information is lost. The reason is that the ignition event does not depend only on the set of reactions with higher sensitivity at the ignition point, but rather on all the kinetics events that occurred previously to that point, from the \u201cstart\u201d of the kinetics process up to the \u201cignition point\u201d. In other words, the ignition is a consequence of the kinetics events in the system that occurred during the entire ignition delay period.\nTherefore a computational tool for the data post-processing of output files from CHEMKIN sensitivity analysis was developed in this work to account for the response of the sensitivity analysis of all reactions at all time-steps during the ignition delay period. This procedure will be called the overall analysis. In this overall analysis, reactions are classified in three levels of \u201cimportance\u201d depending on the value of the sensitivity coefficient calculated by CHEMKIN. This classification is applied independently for positively and negatively affecting reactions at each time step. Figure 9 presents an example of this classification for a given elapsed time.\nReactions identified with ( + + + ), ( + + ) and ( + ) represent the three levels of importance: ( + + + ) to the reaction with the largest sensitivity coefficient, ( + + ) to the reaction with the second largest sensitivity coefficient, and ( + ) to the reaction with the third largest sensitivity coefficient. The same procedure is applied for the reactions with negative effect. Figure 10 and Figure 11 present an application of this classification procedure at three different time steps, two before ignition (time steps 1 and 17) and the last at the ignition time (time step 89). In Figure 11 one can see that at the beginning of the kinetics process (timesteps 1 and 2), reactions RxR-332, RxR-56 and RxR-389 have the largest positive sensitivity coefficients, and reactions RxR-336, RxR-918 and RxR-787 have the largest negative sensitivity coefficients.\nAfterwards, at time-step 17, a new set of reactions hold the largest values (positives and negatives) of sensitivity coefficients. Finally, at the ignition point, time-step 89, a new set of reactions are found the most important: Reactions RxR-332, RxR-21 and RxR-389 with positive effects; and RxR-19, RxR-761 and RxR-321 with negative effects. Once this classification is completed, the method calculates the amount of the ignition delay period in which each reaction remains important, generating an output file as exemplified in Figure 12.\nFigure 9. Example of importance levels for sensitivity coefficients adopted in this work.\nThis output presents the percentage of the total ignition delay period that a given reaction remains as the reaction with the first, second or third largest sensitivity coefficient, ranked separately for positive and negative effects. Note that this technique does not yield any time-integral (absolute) sensitivity coefficient. Rather, it gives information about what reactions are more important during the ignition delay time based on the values of sensitivity coefficients calculated for each time step.\nFigure 13 presents the information obtained by using this overall method of sensitivity analysis when compared to the information generated by the sensitivity analysis only at the ignition point. At the ignition point, only six reactions are pointed out as most sensitive, while the overall analysis provides more complete information. From the reactions with the largest\nnegative coefficients, at ignition point, reaction RxR-19 is the most important reaction responsible for the decrease of temperature.\nIgnition delay time\nTime step 17\nTime step 1\nReactions with more positive influence:\nReactions with more positive influence:\nTime step 89 * IGNITION *\nReactions with more positive influence:\n\n\n\nFigure 10.

In the third level of importance, at the ignition point, reaction RxR-321 appear as the third most important reaction while from the overall analysis, reaction RxR-321 is the third most important reaction at only about ~3% of the ignition delay period while reactions RxR-327, RxR-56 and RxR-761 appear in the third level during ~23%, ~23% and ~16% of the ignition delay period. Therefore, the overall analysis points out those reactions RxR-327, RxR-56, RxR-336, RxR-549, RxR-886 are important reactions to be optimized in order to improve the kinetics model with respect to the ignition delay time.\nThis overall method developed in this work was applied to the optimization process of the ethanol detailed kinetics model described in section 4.1.\n2.4\tFundamentals of shock tube\n2.4.1\tShock tube experiments\nThe shock tube is a laboratory device which is extensively used in studying unsteady short-duration phenomena in the fields of aerodynamics, physics and chemistry (Saad, 1993). Transient wave phenomena occurring when a shock wave propagates at high speed, as well as the wave structure and wave interactions, can be studied in shock tubes.\nBecause of the high stagnation enthalpies (and temperatures) that are obtained, the shock tube provides means to study phenomena, such as the thermodynamic properties of gases at high temperatures, dissociation, ionization and chemical kinetics. Basically, a shock tube consists of a long tubular reactor which is initially separated by a thin diaphragm into two parts. One of them, the low pressure chamber, is filled with the test gas. The compressed, driver, gas is fed into the second part, the high pressure chamber. At a given time, the diaphragm is rapidly burst and the highly compressed driver gas flows into the low pressure chamber. A shock wave is then propagated through the test gas, while a rarefaction wave travels through the driver gas. The axial pressure and temperature distributions before and after bursting of the diaphragm are shown schematically in Figure 14.\nFigure 14. Operation of a shock tube, (a) Initial state, (b) and (c) Propagation of the incident shock wave, (d) and (e) Propagation of the reflected shock wave (Adapted from Zel'dovich et al. 1966a).\nFigure 14 shows the axial pressure and temperature distributions, at (a) t = 0, and for two intermediate times, (b) and (c) showing the distributions of p and T before the arrival of the incident wave to the end wall, and (d) and (e) showing the axial distribution of p and T after the reflected wave reaches the sample gas. In Figure 14, it can be observed that the incident and reflected shock waves induce two increments of temperature and pressure in the test gas.\nSuccessive longitudinal time-pressure distributions, indicating the shock front position, can be plotted in an x-t diagram, i.e., the typical distance-time diagram, as shown in Figure 15 (Zel'dovich et al. 1966a; Kee et. al., 2000).\nAt time t = 0, the diaphragm is ruptured and a series of compression waves rapidly collapse into a normal shock wave. This wave propagates at supersonic speed in the driven\nsection and sets up the fluid downstream to it in motion in the direction of the shock, at velocity Uiw.\nFigure 15. Distance time diagram in shock tube (Adapted from Kee et. al., 2000). Zone 1 -unshocked gas, zone 2 - shocked gas (incident shock), zone 3 - expanded driver gas, zone 4 -unexpanded driver gas, zone 5 - shocked gas (reflected shock).\nDownstream the incident wave, the contact surface between the driven and driver gases moves at velocity Ucs. The difference between Uiw and Ucs permits that the test gas achieves the condition of high pressure and temperature (T5, p5), required by the experiment when the reflected wave is formed and before the arrival of the contact surface. This is shown as region 5 in Figure 15, where the test gas is under uniform conditions. Simultaneously, at the driver section, a set of rarefaction waves propagate in the opposite direction inside the driver gas. The arrival of the rarefaction waves also disturbs the test gas. The time interval between the arrival of the reflected wave and of the contact surface is the available time for measurements, ktms.\n2.4.2\tShock wave theory\n2.4.2.1\tPhysics of shock wave\nA shock wave is a wave in which the properties of a gas change sharply within a short distance in space. When momentum and energy diffusion is neglected, the shock wave manifests itself in the solution of the conservation equations as a mathematical discontinuity.\nWhen these dissipative processes are taken into account, the net effect is to change the discontinuity into a slightly gradual transition which takes place within a distance of a few molecular mean free paths (Bird et al., 1954; Zel'dovich et al., 1966b).\nThe mathematical solution of the one-dimensional steady-state flow equations for a viscous and heat conducting gas is given by Bird et al. (1954) and Zel'dovich et al. (1966b). This solution allows to estimate the shock wave thickness for nitrogen at 25 \u00b0C, and a pressure ratio p/p0 of 1.71 at pressures po from 42 to 85 bar, as varying from 1.0x10-1 p.m to 3.2x10-1 p.m. Using kinetic theory is possible to estimate the molecular mean free path for given conditions, in this case, taking the molecular mean free path l0 as 10-1 p.m, these values correspond to 1.0 to 3.2 molecular mean free paths.\nObviously the shock wave thickness cannot be smaller than the molecular mean free path, since the gas molecules flowing into the discontinuity take at least a few collisions in order to scatter the directed momentum and to convert the kinetic energy of the directed motion into kinetic energy of random motion (temperature). At the same time, the thickness of the shock front in the case of any strong wave cannot include many mean free paths, since the molecules of the incident stream lose, on the average, an appreciate fraction of their momentum during each collision. The relatively small number of molecular collisions that occur within this short distance is, roughly, the minimum number needed to relax the Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium velocity distribution from the kinetic conditions upstream to the shock to those prevailing downstream the shock. However, this small number of collisions is not sufficient for the mixture to reach chemical equilibrium. The chemical species concentrations remain frozen across the shock and slowly evolve towards the equilibrium distribution after the shock has passed. This evolution towards equilibrium is controlled by chemical kinetics.\nSince the gas undergoes an appreciable change of properties in a length equivalent to a small number of mean free paths, the Navier-Stokes equation, which relies on the continuum approximation, is often insufficiently accurate to describe the structure and thickness of the wave. The macroscopic conservation equations can, however, be used to describe the evolution of the flow properties upstream and downstream to the shock wave, where the continuum hypothesis is applicable. A comprehensive discussion about the shock structure can be found in Zel'dovich et al. (1966b).\n2.4.2.2\tBoundary layer interaction\nWhen a fluid is set in motion in contact to a solid surface a fluid-dynamic boundary layer is formed. When a shock interacts with a boundary layer, the thickness of the layer is zero at the shock front, increases across the shock wave and contact surface and reaches its free stream value in the expanding driver gas. This thickness falls back to zero again at the trailing rarefaction wave. In an ideal shock tube experiment both the shock and the contact surface are plane sharp discontinuity surfaces, move with constant velocity and the flow between then is uniform. Boundary layer effects, however, are present in shock tube experiments and can modify the expected ideal performance. The presence of a wall boundary layer causes the shock to decelerate (shock attenuation), the contact surface to accelerate and the flow to be non-uniform (Mirels, 1963; Rudinger, 1961)\nFigure 16, adapted from Mirels (1963), presents a rendering of (a) the x-t diagram and (b) the flow velocity at time ta for an incident shock wave.\nFigure 16. Boundary layer in shock tube (Adapted from Mirels, 1963).\nThe difference between the ideal and the real positions of the shock and the contact surface can be noticed. It can also be observed that the boundary layer begins at the incident shock wave and ends at the rarefaction wave while its thickness increases with time.\nRudinger (1961) reports the effect of the boundary layer growth on shock reflection from a closed end. It is shown that the pressure behind a propagating shock wave increases slightly with time as a result of the growing of the boundary layer, and that this pressure\nincrease is significantly magnified by the reflected shock wave. Finally, we note that turbulent eddies wrinkle the contact surface promoting mixing between reactants and driver gases.\nMirels (1963) also provides a relation for the critical Reynolds number for transition from laminar to turbulent regime in the boundary layer in the case of low pressure shock tubes. He shows that transition to turbulent boundary layer becomes more likely as the initial pressure of the shock tube and the shock Mach number increase.\n2.4.2.3\t1D modeling of flow behind shock waves\nThe set of equations whose solution describe the concentration, velocity and temperature distributions around the shock wave are derived from the classical conservation laws of mass, linear momentum and energy for gas phase reactive flows. In the CHEMKIN SHOCK package, the flow is assumed to be adiabatic and one-dimensional; mass, heat and linear momentum diffusion are neglected and ideal gas behavior is assumed. Since test times downstream to shock waves are typically of the order of a few hundred microseconds, molecular transport has a negligible effect on the flow field. Initial conditions for the governing equations are derived from the Rankine-Hugoniot relations for flow across a normal shock. The conservation equations for one-dimensional flow through an arbitrary cross-section tube solved in the CHEMKIN SHOCK package are:\nContinuity:\n\tpuA = constant ,\t[33]\nMomentum:\t\t\n\tdu dp pu\t+\t= 0 ,\t[34]\nEnergy:\tdx dx\t\n\tdh\tdu\t[35]\n\t+ u = 0 ,\t\nMass of chemical species:\tdx\tdx\t\n\tdE,\t\n\tp\t- = (0kWk .\t[36]\nk k\nax\nTemperature is related to the specific enthalpy of the gas mixture through the\nrelations:\nN\nh = 2hkYk ,\t[37]\nk=1\nand\nT hk =(hk )o +J cpkdT .\nTo\n[38]\nThe net molar production rate of each species due to chemical reaction is denoted by d>k. The equation of state relating the intensive thermodynamic properties is:\npW = pKT ,\n[39]\nwhere the mixture molecular weight, W, is determined from the local gas concentration\nusing:\nN\nS T/W,\nk=1\n[40]\nIn the shock tube experiments, the usual measurable quantities are density, species concentration, velocity and temperature as functions of time. It is therefore desirable to have time as independent variable and not distance. Employing the relation\nd\td\n= u , dt\tdx\n[41]\nand differentiating equations [37], [38], [39] and [40], and combining the results, the\nfollowing set of coupled, ordinary differential equations are obtained:\nd\ndt\n[42]\ndYk\t\u25a0> kWk\ndt p\n[43]\ndT\ndt\ndu\tu d p u2 (dA\ndt\tp dt A du\nu2 d p pcp dt\ndA dx )\n[44]\n[45]\nThe time-histories of the measurable flow quantities should satisfy these relations. The CHEMKIN SHOCK solver uses the set of equations [42], [43], [44] and [45] in order to determine the mass concentration, pressure and temperature time-histories of the system by using the corresponding initial conditions.\nChapter 3: Experiment\n3.1\tThe High Pressure Shock Tube at IVG\nThe high pressure shock tube at IVG - University of Duisburg Essen is composed by a tubular section of 12.5 m divided by a diaphragm into a driver section of 6.1 m and a driven section of 6.4 m in length.\nThe device is instrumented at the low pressure section with pressure and quemiluminescense sensors in order to capture the incident and reflected shock waves and the time of ignition in each experiment of ignition delay time. Figure 17 shows a diagram with the basic compounds of the shock tube.\nFigure 18 shows a photograph of the high pressure shock tube facility. Several kinetics studies of ignition delay times in pure fuels and gasoline surrogates have been performed in this device (see ref. Firki et al., 2008; Herzler et al., 2005; Hartmann et al. 2009; Herzler et al. 2007).\nFigure 17. Diagram with the basic compounds of the shock tube at IVG - UDE (Germany).\nFigure 18. High Pressure Shock Tube at IVG - University of Duisburg-Essen. Maximum Operation Pressure = 500 bar.\n3.2\tUncertainties related to the shock tube experiments.\nThere are several uncertainties associated to the ignition delay time measurements in shock tube experiment. The more representative systematic errors are related to the mixture preparation position of pressure and chemiluminescence devices, formation of boundary layer and optical access of the chemiluminescence sensor to the region of test.\n3.2.1\tMixture preparation and injection into shock tube test section.\nThe pure hydrocarbon fuels were acquired from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, with purity > 99.8 %. The liquid mixtures were prepared in clean and haled glass-recipients. The liquid volume of mixture for each set of experiments was dosed at the volumetric composition of each binary (GS-A) and quaternary (GS-B) blends of gasoline surrogates.\nThe homogenization of the mixture in liquid phase is warranted by manual slow circular movements of the glass recipient during a short period of time of approximately of 3 min. The mixing is done inside a laminar flow cabinet, as shown in Figure 19 (A). The injection of the mixture into the shock tube is done using a syringe HAMILTON CO USA, of 5 ml, as shown in Figure 19 (B) and (C).\nFigure 19. (A) Cabinet for mixture preparation. (B) Syringe used to the injection of the mixture to the shock tube. (C) Injection of the gasoline surrogate into the shock tube.\nAfter injection of the liquid mixture into the shock tube, the mixture begins to evaporate. Usually 1.5 hours later, the pressure reached in the test section is measured and compared to the value calculated theoretically by using Dalton's Law, taking into account all the compounds in the mixture of gasoline surrogates. In this work, in all the valid tests there was no difference between the measured and calculated values of pressure after injection of the mixture into the shock tube test section. This fact was taken as a confirmation that there was total evaporation of the liquid mixture inside the shock tube. Also, it is leave into account the value of the vapor pressure of compounds in the mixture, the vapor pressure of each component have to be greater than the measured/calculated pressure after injection of the mixture into the test section of the shock tube, as shown in Table 7.\nAfter the complete evaporation of the liquid mixture, the test section is filled with synthetic air (Stickstoff 4.6 AIR LIQUID Deutschland GmbH), manometrically, till the pressure reaches the calculated value of p1 (see Table 7). In this work the synthetic air load was performed carefully and the value of p1 always match the calculated value. One hour after the synthetic air load process is finished the experiment is performed. The synthetic air load process generates high turbulence levels inside the test section. This fact guarantee two\naspects: (a) the homogenization of the reactive mixture and, (b) it helps to reduce the possibility of stratification due to the density difference among the mixture components.\nTable 7.

This value can be used in order to estimate the uncertainties in the stoichiometry, f. Taking the last experiment on Table 7 as an example for error calculations, pressure after injection of 136.78 mbar and fixing p1 as 4127.80 mbar, the accuracy of the device indicates an error propagation, of about \u00b1 0.009 in the stoichiometry of the mixture, f\n3.2.2\tShock speeds measurements.\nShock speeds were determined by using the signals of three piezopressure transducers placed over the last 1.0 m of the shock tube and extrapolated to the endwall section. Shock attenuations were typically 0.7%/m to 2.5%/m. The measured shock velocities were compared to the initially estimated values of incident shock waves and differences of about \u00b10.3% were found. Afterward, reflected shock conditions were determined from the standard onedimensional shock relations and the blended thermodynamic database (Marinov 1999; Curran et al. 1998; Metcalfe et al. 2007; Andrae et al. 2007 and Maurice 1996) for iso-octane, n-\nheptane, toluene and ethanol. Using the SHOCK package of CHEMKIN, uncertainties of about \u00b1 0.3% in the incident wave speed yield variations in the calculated T5 of about \u00b1 7 K and variations in the calculated ignition delay time of about \u00b1 7.5%, in agreement with the experimental uncertainties (temperature and ignition delay time) cited in the literature for shock tube experiments (Davidson et al. 2002; Vasudevan et al. 2005; Dean et al. 2007; Davidson et al. 2000). In this work, the estimated uncertainties in the ignition delay time are in the range of \u00b1 7.5% to \u00b1 10%.\n3.2.3\tFormation of boundary layer.\nAs discussed by Davidson and Hanson (2004), in shock tube experiments there are several nonideal effects that influence the measurement of ignition delay time. When modeling ignition delay in shock tubes, Perfectly Stirred Reactor conditions (Zeroth-order approximation model) are used and then, the numerical results are compared to the measurements.\nThe simulation also assumes that behind the shock wave the spatial and temporal conditions are uniform, i.e., the incident and reflected shock waves travel through the test gas and leave it unperturbed. In a real shock-heated gas ignition process there is the formation of a boundary layer at the tube wall that grows with time the propagation of the shock wave and contact surface, as described in section 2.4.2.2. The observed effect of the of formation and growth of the boundary layer behind the incident shock wave is the generation of a gradual increase in temperature and pressure in the core of the flow (T2 andp2). When the shock wave returns as a reflected shock, it sets the temperature and pressure (T5 and p5) to values higher than those calculated initially using the Rankine-Hugoniot relations. Also, the displacement of the reflected shock wave also creates a boundary layer behind it, affecting the temperature and pressure (T5 and p5).\nPetersen and Hanson (2000) proposed a methodology to evaluate this source of systematic error in high pressure shock tubes. They proposed a relation between the relative change of T5 with reflected shock test time (dT*/dr), the expression\ndT *\ndr\n10 s-1\n[46]\n1\nis proposed for the relative change on temperature T5 for larger diameter shock tubes (~15\ncm). For shock tube diameter less than 10 cm the value of the relative change (T* = AT5/T5initial) increase to values of 20 - 30 s-1. Assuming the boundary layer effect as\nmajor systematic error on temperature, and for shock tube diameter of 9 cm, we can use equation [46] in order to estimate the uncertainties on temperature T5, as follows:\ndT *\ndr\n20 s\u20191\n1\nT *\tT\nJ dT* -20 s\u20191 xj dr ,\nT\tto\nT* \u00ab 20 s\u20191 x(r)\nat5\nT\n5 initial\n5 initial\nT5 final\t[20 s 1 X (gn ) + 1] T5 initial\nFor example, ignition of ethanol at T5 initial = 937 K, with ignition delay time of t = 1006 ps, the estimated increase on temperature AT5 is about \u00b1 19 K.\n3.3\tPreparation and measurement procedure\nThe steps taken to perform a single test can be summarized as follows. The driven section is pumped down to pressures below 10-2 mbar. Gas mixtures are prepared by injection of a liquid mixture and subsequent complete evaporation. The measured pressure into the driven section, when the fuel is injected, must be inferior to the vapor pressure of the fuel mixture.\nThe total amount of fuel and air is controlled manometrically in order to ensure the desired equivalence ratio. The shock speed is measured over two time intervals using three piezo-electric pressure gauges. The data is recorded with a time resolution of 0.1 ps. The temperature and pressure downstream to the reflected shock wave are calculated from the measured incident shock speed and the attenuation using an one-dimensional shock-tube model (CHEMKIN).\nThe estimated uncertainty, equation [46], in reflected shock temperature is less than \u00b125 K in the temperature and time range of the measurements. The experiments are carried out in synthetic air containing 79.5% N2 and 20.5% O2 by volume.\nThe model calculations used here are based on an isobaric assumption. The first stage of pre-ignition, however, causes indeed a slight pressure increase, which can expand in the form of a non-stationary wave, thus influencing the ignition behavior. In the crucial case, i.e., long time observation related to low-to-intermediate temperature value, the maximum temperature increase due to this effect was estimated to be 70 K. Moreover, it should be\nmentioned that small changes in temperature are most relevant to measurements at low temperature and therefore do not dramatically affect the ignition delay times Ting in the NTC range. It can be argued that this effect is to some extent fuel-specific and also dependent on how well the driver gas tailoring was chosen.\nThe driver gas is mixed in-situ by using two high-pressure mass-flow controllers (Bronkhorst Hi-Tec flow meter). Helium is used as the main component and 5 - 20% Argon is added to match the acoustic impedance of the test gas. The acoustic impedance is defined as the ratio of acoustic pressure to acoustics volume flow and it is strongly dependent of the density of the flow.\nThe composition was calculated for each experimental condition using equations by Oertel (1966) and Palmer and Knox (1961). After rupture of the diaphragm, the ignition is observed downstream the reflected shock waves by measuring the pressure history with a piezo-electric gauge (PCB HM 112 A03) at a side-wall position 15 mm upstream to the endplate. Also, CH* chemiluminescence is measured at the same position.\nThe spontaneous light emission from the test region is filtered by a band pass filter (431.5 nm, 5 nm HWHM) and detected with a photomultiplier with a time resolution of 1 |is. Then, ignition delay times are determined by extrapolating either the steepest increase of the CH* emission signal to its zero level on the time axis or the pressure increase due to the ignition, as shown in Figure 20. Both procedures yield very similar results (&lt;5 % deviation). In this work, the data obtained from the chemiluminescence measurement is used.\nFigure 21 (A) shows the diaphragm in its initial state. This diaphragm has a thickness of 3.1 mm and depth of the cross groove of 0.8 mm. The groove is used to facilitate an uniform burst of the diaphragm.

The experiments were done over the pressure range of 10 - 50 bar, intermediate temperatures covering the range 690 - 1200 K at lean (^ = 0.3) and stoichiometric (^ = 1.0) compositions. The experimental conditions are comparable to the operating conditions found in combustion chambers of spark-ignition internal combustion engines.

Example of surrogate A/air ignition data showing the determination of the ignition delay time\nThe two-step increase in pressure is due to the passage of the incident and the reflected shock wave (time zero) followed by a constant pressure for about 4750 gs. The CH* emission (upper part of Figure 22) remains at zero level for 4750 gs, followed by a steep rise that indicates ignition. Ignition delay times shown here are based on an extrapolation of the increase in CH* chemiluminescence emission to the zero level.\nIn this work, one test was performed for each experimental condition of pressure and temperature (T5, p5), except for dispersed experimental results, for which two or three additional tests were performed. Experimental results for gasoline surrogates GS-C, GS-D and GS-E were obtained from the experimental work of Fikri et al., (2008).\n3.4.1\tMeasurements of IDT for ethanol-air system, $ = 1.0 , $ = 0.3\nThe ignition delay times evaluated from the CH* emission are listed in Table 10 along with the respective pressures p and temperatures T, for stoichiometric and lean ethanol-air mixture. At temperatures lower than those shown in Table 10 no ignition was observed within the test time of the experiment (15 ms).\nFigure 23 shows the experimental results for ignition delay time as a function of temperature (as an Arrhenius plot) for different pressures. The data can be conveniently curve-fitted to an equation of the form\n[47]\nwhere x is the pressure exponent (pressure dependence factor). Multiple linear regression analysis using ln(i) as the dependent variable and (E/Z) and ln(p) as independent variables identified the value of x as 0.83, using the data for f = 1.0 listed in Table 10.\nThe correlation coefficient, R2, of the regression was 0.94. An expression of t = t30 (p/30 bar)-0.83 was identified for the scaled pressure. For the temperature behavior, an expression of\nwas determined from a fit for the measured range of temperature and for a stoichiometric mixture. The fitting is shown in Figure 23.\nThe measured ignition delay times decreased for higher temperatures and presented a lower sensitivity to pressure for the higher pressures.\nTable 10.

This small difference is evidenced by the values of the apparent activation energies.\nFigure 25.

The experiments were carried out with stoichiometric mixtures f = 1.0, temperature range of 690 &lt;T &lt;1200 K, and pressure of 30 \u00b1 2 bar. The results of the ignition delay time experiments for surrogate B are presented in Table 12 and depicted in Figure 26. For this data set, a flat temperature dependence behavior is observed at around 900 K. Note that, for pressure of 10 bar and temperature below 900 K, no-ignition was observed during the available measurement time. However, contrary to the other mixtures, at p5 = 30 bar ignition was observed below 800 K Multiple linear regression analyses using ln(i) as the dependent variable and (1/T) and ln(p) as independent variable identified the value of x as 0.72, using the data for f = 1.0 listed in Table 12. The correlation coefficient, R2, of the regression was 0.89. An expression of t = t30 (p/30 bar) 072 was identified for the scaled pressure.

Experimental results of ignition delay time for ethanol pure, Gasoline surrogate -GS-A and Gasoline surrogate GS-B at pressure of 30 bar and stoichiometric condition.\nIt can be observed that for higher and lowers temperatures (T > 1050 K and T &lt;850 K), Gasoline surrogate B present more resistance to the autoignition process. For intermediate temperatures (1050 K > T > 850 K), ethanol pure, GS-A and GS-B gives similar results of ignition delay times.\nChapter 4: Modeling and Analysis\nThe adaptation process of the kinetics models was based on blending the different submechanisms for ethanol and other sub-structures from Marinov (1999), Li (2004) and Lin et al., (2002, 2003, 2004), Cancino et al., (2009b), that were not taken into account by Konnov (2000), Metcalfe et al., (2007), Andrae et al., (2007) and Maurice (1996). Then, the predictions of ignition delay time using the mechanisms formed are compared to the measurements and results from the individual mechanisms, in order to extend the validation of the kinetics model.\nThe blending of two different mechanisms requires a sequence of steps that can be outlined as:\n1.\tAnalyze and potentially adjust the kinetics information of the mechanisms for their use in CHEMKIN.\n2.\tCheck the species names in both mechanisms the mechanisms and remove duplicate reactions from the second (minor) mechanism.\n3.\tAdd the missing reactions into the major mechanism.\n4.\tCheck the thermodynamic data base of the major mechanism and upgrade it with data for the missing species.\n5.\tTest the blended kinetics model with the CHEMKIN interpreter and validate it against measured ignition delay times to ensure/guarantee that the added reactions for an additional fuel component do not change the behavior of the base mechanism in case this component is not present.\n6.\tDetermine the rate-controlling route for autoignition via an overall sensitivity analysis and check whether the most sensitive reactions have reliable, i.e., directly measured, kinetics data.\nThe blending procedure is time consuming. When two chemical species have the same empirical formula, it is necessary to check their thermodynamic databases by comparing the enthalpy h, heat capacity cp, and entropy s at several temperatures. If their thermodynamic properties return the same (or similar) values, then, both chemical species are considered to be identical despite different names or abbreviations used in the original kinetics models. Productivity increases with the use of computational tools. The programs of Rolland and Simmie (2004) were used to compare the kinetics mechanisms and thermodynamic databases.\n4.1\tEthanol-air system\n4.1.1\tChemical reaction pathways for thermal oxidation of ethanol\nSeveral authors have qualitatively described the decomposition of ethanol. Recently, Lin et al., (2002, 2003 and 2004) reported 11 different routes for ethanol decomposition involving reactive radical species.\nFigure 29 summarizes these major routes. Box I shows the decomposition routes involving methyl radical giving methane as a product in three routes and hydrogen atom in a fourth route. The fifth route gives C2H6 (ethane), CH3CH2OCH3 (methoxy), CH3CH2 (ethyl radical), CH3OH (Methyl alcohol), CH2CH2OH (Ethoxy radical), CH3CH2O (Methyl radical, methoxy-), CH3CHOH (Ethyl radical, 1-hydroxy) and CH4 (Methane)\nBox II depicts H abstraction involving H atoms and producing molecular hydrogen via three routes and additional other unstable species. Box III depicts the H abstraction by a cleavage process involving a third body (bimolecular); all routes giving acetaldehyde, molecular and atomic hydrogen. Box IV shows the decomposition by cleavage involving a third body (bimolecular) of the C-C and C-O bonds and the products are formaldehyde, methane and other unstable species. One can clearly see that the pyrolysis of ethanol proceeds by a chain-branching mechanism.\nKinetics models of ignition of ethanol/O2 (Borisov et al., 1992) and ethanol/air (Cancino and Oliveira, 2005a; Gardiner, 2000) show that during the induction period ethanol is consumed almost completely. The depletion of the fuel is induced by oxidative pyrolysis. Therefore, the ethanol oxidation model capable of describing accumulation of the products during the induction period and the promoter effect on the ignition process must be based on an ethanol pyrolysis mechanism (Borisov et al., 1992), such as the one described above and depicted in Figure 29.\nSince the pathways depicted in Figure 29 proceed at different rates, depending on the range of temperature and pressure considered, a careful analysis and comparison to critical experiments may be able to reveal the most important routes for different pressure and temperature regimes. The mechanistic analysis for temperature can be usually separated in a low temperature regime (below 1000 K) and a high temperature regime (above 1000 K).\n4.1.1.1\tLow-temperature (T &lt;1000 K) oxidation of ethanol\nInformation on low-temperature oxidation of ethanol is scarce. Battin-Leclerc (2008) recently reported an extensive review of kinetics models for low-temperature oxidation of hydrocarbons involving alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes and aromatic compounds, but did not include ethanol and other oxygenated hydrocarbons.\nBarnard and Hughes (1960) reported experimental results of the ethanol pyrolysis in a reaction vessel for a temperature range from 850 to 900 K and pressures in the range of 6.6*10-2 to 4.66* 10-1 bar. They measured the concentration history of H2, CO, CH4, CH3HCO and C2 throughout the reaction and revealed that the major pyrolysis products are molecular hydrogen and acetaldehyde (CH3HCO). They also found that the rate of reaction measured as -d[C2H5OH]/dt was of first order with respect to the initial ethanol concentration in the pressure range from 4.66*10-2 to 1.0*10-1 bar. The fitted global Arrhenius equation for the experimental results was &amp;a(7)=1010.0(\u00b10.4)exp[-46200(\u00b11700)ZRr] s-1. Above 0.1 bar the reaction order of the depletion of ethanol was found to be of a higher order.\nBorisov et al. (1991) reported experimental results of ethanol pyrolysis in a temperature range of 700 to 1700 K and at pressure of 1 bar in a static vessel. They found that their results agreed fairly well with the /-dependence of the effective rate constant proposed by Barnard and Hughes (1960). The comparison between Borisov's and Barnard's results\nindicates that the effective rate constant of ethanol is not strongly dependent on the pressure at temperatures below 900 K.\nBoth Barnard and Hughes (1960) and Borisov et al., (1991) proposed general guidelines for the ethanol pyrolysis at low temperatures, depicted in Figure 30, which are a sub-set of the more complete scheme depicted in Figure 29. They proposed that the pyrolysis starts with a first stage of H-abstraction in the three possible locations: Hx, in the hydroxyl group; Hs, attached to the secondary carbon and Hp, attached to the primary carbon. H atoms are released and three CnHpO radicals are formed: CH3CH2O, CH2CH2OH and CH3CHOH. In a second stage, these H atoms react with ethanol provoking further H-elimination as H2 and forming more CnHpO radicals (CH3CH2O, CH2CH2OH and CH3CHOH). The H atoms released in the first two stages accelerate the ethanol depletion. In a third stage, the CnHpO radicals decompose releasing more hydrogen atoms and acetaldehyde. Therefore, the low-temperature ethanol oxidation proceeds basically by H abstraction. The cleavages of the C-C and C-O bonds in the parent molecule are, due to energetic restrictions, unimportant (Borisov et al., 1991).\nC2H5OH\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t,+ H \u00cd\t,\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t+ H ' 1\t\tf+ H\t!\n\tI : H2-!\t\t\t\tH2-\t\t\nr-CH3CH2O\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nL.\n. u\nI\nl\n1 CH2CH2OH\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nHx - Abstraction\nI I *\nch3ch2o\n+ M\nt t\nCH3 CH2O\nI I\nch3ch2o\n+ M\nrq\nH\n1\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI I\nHp - Abstraction \u00a1 I\nCH2CH2OH\n+ M\nH\nch3choh\nHs - Abstraction\nI\n*\nch3choh\n+ M\n+ H\n+ M\nH\n+ M\n+ M\nI\nH\n+ M\nH\nH\nch3hco\n<\nH2\nFigure 30. Low-temperature ethanol oxidation routes.\n4.1.1.2\tHigh-temperature (T > 1000 K) oxidation of ethanol\nSeveral studies about the high-temperature oxidation of ethanol have been published. Borisov et al. (1989) reported the first data of ignition delay time measurements in a shock tube for mixtures of ethanol and oxygen in a temperature range of 700 to 1550 K and pressures between 0.5 and 6.0 bar. In their study, they also present data for acetaldehyde. Borisov et al., (1991) reported data of ethanol pyrolysis at atmospheric pressure, in a temperature range of 700 to 1700 K in a static reaction vessel. They developed the first detailed kinetics model for ethanol, including pyrolysis and oxidation reactions involving hydrogen, methane, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and ethanol. The model was tested for lean, stoichiometric and rich ethanol/O2 mixtures at atmospheric pressure and temperatures between 900 and 1500 K.\nDunphy and Simmie (1991) reported a survey on shock tube measurements of ignition delay times in ethanol/O2 mixtures covering equivalence ratios of 0.2 &lt;f &lt;2.0, temperatures between 1080 and 1660 K and pressure range of 1.8 to 4.6 bar. Dunphy et al., (1991) developed a detailed kinetics model for the high-temperature ethanol oxidation with molecular oxygen and this model was validated against measurements of Dunphy and Simmie (1991).\nEgolfopoulos et al., (1992) reported a detailed kinetics model for the high-temperature oxidation of ethanol/O2/Ar mixtures that was tested against shock-tube data for 1300 K &lt;T &lt;1600 K and 0.8 bar&lt;p &lt;1.0 bar.\nSimilarly, Curran et al., (1992) studied ethanol oxidation in a shock tube by measuring the ignition delay time of ethanol/O2 mixtures at pressure of 2.3 bar at 1100 K &lt;T &lt;1900 K and 0.25 &lt;f &lt;1.5. A detailed kinetics model was validated against the obtained experimental results.\nCancino and Oliveira (2005a, 2006) numerically analyzed the performance of the thermal ignition of ethanol/air mixtures using the detailed kinetics models of Marinov (1999) and Konnov (2000) at 1.0 bar&lt;p &lt;5.0 bar and temperatures of 1200 and 1400 K. Some key reactions of the ethanol oxidation were analyzed and a detailed kinetics model including NOx kinetics was proposed.\nSaxena and Williams (2007) performed a detailed kinetics model for ethanol oxidation and validated it against experimental data of Dunphy and Simmie (1991) for 1300 K &lt;T &lt;1700 K and 1.0 bar&lt;p &lt;4.6 bar.\nCancino et al. (2007) reported the first high-pressure (30 bar) measurements of ignition delay times in a shock tube for ethanol/air mixtures at 690 K &lt;T &lt;1200 K and proposed a new tailored detailed kinetics model using the mechanisms of Marinov (1999) and Konnov (2000).\nAll measurements reported in the literature, in the pressure range of 0.5 bar&lt;p &lt;5.0, show that an increase in total pressure is accompanied by a decrease in ignition delay time.\nFrom the available kinetics models, the behavior of ethanol oxidation at high temperature can be summarized as follows: In the high-temperature range, the thermal decomposition of ethanol starts with the C-C bond cleavage giving methyl (CH3) and hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) radicals (Natarajan and Bhaskaram, 1981; Gardiner, 2000) as products. As the fuel continues to decompose (see box IV in Figure 29) the hydroxymethyl produced in the initiation phase can dissociate due to the low dissociation barrier producing H atoms and formaldehyde (CH2O).\nMethyl also contributes to the build-up of the radical pool composed by O, H and OH that accelerates the depletion of the fuel by ethanol-radical reactions, as depicted in boxes I and II in Figure 29. Stable intermediates like acetaldehyde (CH3HCO), formaldehyde (H2CO) and formyl radical (CHO) are mainly responsible for the weakening of the branching reactions and the acetaldehyde concentrations encountered in the ethanol oxidation are found to be higher than of other intermediates (Natarajan and Bhaskaram, 1981).\nExcluding a single result at 30 bar, the low temperature data available in the literature has been measured up to 1 bar. High temperature data has been measured up to 5 bar. Thus, the available mechanisms have been only validated for low pressure data and questions remain whether the patterns discussed above are still correct for higher pressures and lower temperatures.\nComparison of results of the mechanisms available in the literature (Cancino et al. 2007) with the data presented in Chapter 3 revealed poor prediction. Therefore, in the following section a new mechanism is proposed and then compared to the available data in the literature and to the data presented in Chapter 3.\n4.1.2\tDetailed kinetics model for ethanol oxidation\nSeveral detailed kinetics mechanisms for different hydrocarbons are available in the literature. Simmie (2003) presented a comprehensive review of detailed kinetics models for hydrocarbons. The detailed kinetics model by Konnov (2000) was developed for combustion\nof small hydrocarbons containing up to 3 carbon atoms in the molecule, including C1, C2 and C3 hydrocarbon sub-kinetics. The mechanism has been validated against several experimental results involving shock tube ignition delay times, flow reactor data, laminar flame species profiles, and laminar flame speeds covering different reactive systems.\nThis mechanism has not yet been used in the literature for predicting the combustion of ethanol. Nevertheless, Konnov (2005) mentioned that it might be suitable to predict the combustion of ethanol when the additional thermodynamic properties of chemical species not present in the mechanism, are given. The Marinov mechanism (1999), however, was developed exclusively for high-temperature oxidation of ethanol/O2 mixtures and contains kinetics sub-models for methane and other products in the oxidation of ethanol.\nIn the present work, the Konnov (2000) and Marinov (1999) detailed kinetics models were taken and tailored to build up the proposed model. Initially, the extensively tested kinetics model for small hydrocarbons of Konnov was extended to the combustion of ethanol by adding the reactions described by Marinov that were missing in Konnov's mechanism.\nThen, in order to further improve the predictive capability of the model, a comprehensive review of the literature was performed and new kinetics data was found in Li (2004) and Lin et al. (2002, 2003, 2004).\nThis procedure allowed for an update of the values of the reaction constants of several elementary reactions involving ethanol. Some elementary reactions that appeared neither in Konnov's nor in Marinov's mechanisms were also added. In summary, the model allows for the following specific reactions for ethanol decomposition:\nC2H5OH > C2H4 + H2O\t(R1)\nCH3 + CH2OH\t(R2)\n>\tCH3CHO+H2\t(R3)\n>\tC2H3OH+H2\t(R4)\n>\tCH4 + CH2O\t(R5)\nh+c2h5oh > ch3choh+h2 c2h4oh+h2 c2h5o+h2 c2h5 + h2o\n(R12)\n(R13)\n(R14)\n(R15)\nCH4 + CHOH\t(R6)\nCH3CH+H2O (R7)\nC2H5 + OH\nC2H5O + H\n(R8)\n(R9)\nCH3CHOH + H\nC2H4OH + H\n(R10)\n(R11)\nCH3+C2H5OH > CH4 + CH3CHOH\t(R16)\nCH4 + CH3CH2O\t(R17)\n>\tCH4 + CH2CH2OH (R18)\n>\tCH3OH + CH3CH2 (R19)\n>\tH + CH3CH2OCH3\t(R20)\nLin (2002) determined that, at pressures below 10 bar and temperature range of 7002500 K, the unimolecular decomposition of ethanol occurs primarily by the dehydration reaction producing C2H4 + H2O, represented by reaction (R1) with an energy barrier of 278.65\nkJ/mol. At high-pressure limit, and over 1500 K, the production of CH3 and CH2OH represented by reaction (R2) becomes dominant.\nThe H2-molecular elimination process, represented by reactions (R3) and (R4), is not important throughout the temperature range investigated (700 - 2500 K), Reaction (R5) involves the abstraction of the H atom from the OH group producing CH4 and CH2O, the barrier of energy calculated by Lin (2002) was 417.14 kJ/mol. Reaction (R6) also producing methane, has an energy barrier 58.57 kJ/mol lower that (R6). Reaction (R7) analogous to channel of (R1) producing H2O and CH3CH, has a dissociation barrier of 346.85 kJ/mol. Reaction (R8) producing hydroxyl radical and C2H5 has an energy barrier of 396.64 kJ/mol, 12.55 kJ/mol higher than the prediction of Marinov (1999).\nThe reactions (R9)-(R11) were not included in the computational chemistry calculation of Lin (2002).\nConcerning the chain-propagation reactions by the H atom (reactions R12 to R15) the reaction of dehydration (R15) has a high energy barrier and the probability that reaction (R15) occurs, in the range of temperature investigated in this study, is very low. In this group of reactions, reaction (R14) represents about 10% of the total reaction rate in the temperature range analyzed by Lin (2003). Reactions (R12) and (R13) remain, however, the most important because of their activation energies (energy barrier).\nIn the CH3-radical chain-propagation reactions, reactions (R19) and (R20) have higher energy barriers and their feasibility can be ruled out kinetically in the temperature range investigated in this study.\nThe other reactions forming methane by H abstraction, reactions (R16), (R17) and (R18), remain important because of their values of energy barrier. At higher temperatures (T > ~1200 K), reaction (R18) becomes dominant.\nThese oxidation routes lead ultimately to the production of methane, formaldehyde and other oxygenated hydrocarbons, as depicted in Figure 29, whose kinetics are well treated in the Konnov (2000) mechanism.\nIn the proposed detailed kinetics model the most important reactions for the ethanol oxidation were selected and placed in the proposed detailed kinetics model, ruling out those reactions whose energy barriers limitations were noted by the different authors. The final proposed detailed kinetics model is composed by 136 chemical species and 1136 elementary reactions. Table 13 shows the major characteristics of the detailed kinetics mechanism used in this work.\nTable 13.

Experimental and numerical results for ethanol-air mixture at pressure of 30 bar and stoichiometric composition.\nFrom Figure 31 one can see that the Marinov model overestimates the ignition delay time for high pressures and over the temperature range investigated in this work. The Konnov model is in agree went with the experimental data but, for temperatures below 900 K the model predicts no-ignition in the reactive mixture. The hybrid model Marinov-Konnov works at temperatures below 900 K, but the prediction of the IDT falls dramatically for lowers\ntemperatures. The detailed kinetics model proposed in this work captures two important aspects of the experimental data, the apparent activation energy at higher temperatures and the plateau regime at lower temperatures.\nFigure 32 shows the comparison between the measured and the predicted ignition delay times by using the proposed detailed kinetics model for ethanol oxidation. The kinetics model is able to predict the general trends with temperature and pressure. The proposed ethanol detailed kinetics model shows good agreement in terms of global activation energy, pre-exponential factor and pressure dependence. The same curve fitting used to approximate the measured ignition delay times was applied to the predicted results. The curve fitted expression obtained is\nt/ps = 10-1.75 exp^+111.50 kJ/m</^7^(pbar)\t\u2019 Proposed model, this work.\nThis is very similar to the curve fit obtained for the measurements, repeated here as, t/ps = 10-1.79exp^+107.58 kJ/mo/^^(pbar)\t\u2019 Experimental fit, this work\nHowever, at the pressure of 10 bar, and temperature about 900 K the detailed kinetics model overpredicts the ignition delay time in about ~ 97%. This behavior must be further explored by comparing the predictions to measurements at lower pressures.\nFigure 32. Comparison between predicted and measured ignition delay times for ethanol-air under stoichiometric composition using the proposed model.\nFigure 33 shows the comparison between experimental and numerical results for lean = 0.3) and stoichiometric = 1.0) mixtures at pressure of 30 bar. At stoichiometric conditions there is a tendency of flattening of the ignition delay time dependency with temperature for temperatures below 900 K. The proposed detailed kinetics model is able to predict this effect.\nFigure 33. Comparison between predicted and measured ignition delay times of ethanol-air for lean ($ = 0.3) and stoichiometric (^ = 1.0) mixtures at pressure of 30 bar.\n4.1.3.2\tLow pressures and high temperatures\nFigure 34 shows the comparison between measured (from Dunphy and Simmie, 1991) and predicted ignition delay times of ethanol-O2 mixtures for equivalence ratios of 0.5, 2.0 and 1.0 at pressures of 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 bar respectively.\nIn Figure 34 it is possible to note that the proposed kinetics model reproduces the overall trends of the measurements. However, the measurements show a faster decay at temperatures about 1300 K, indicating that the predictions overestimate the apparent activation energy for the ignition delay in the region around 1300 K. The curve fits obtained by Dunphy and Simmie (1991) are\nT\u00b0H/s = 10-12.7 exp(+14\u2122 K)[C2H5OH]-0.415[O2]-0.785[Ar]+0.648 , tco-o/$ = 10-14.0 expK)[C2H5OH]-0.315[O2]-0.780[Ar]+0.259 , = 10-140 expP16960 K[C2H5OH]-0.130[O2]-0.784[Ar]+0.140 ,\nwith concentrations of ethanol, oxygen and argon in mol cm-3.Note that the values of the global Activation Energy (Activation Temperature x ) calculated by Dunphy and Simmie (1991) are 122.88 kJ/mol, 129.28 kJ/mol and 141 kJ/mol, for ignition delays obtained from OH, CO-O and pressure methods respectively, for pressures between 1.0 - 4.6 bar, and temperature range of 1300 K - 1700 K. In this work, the global activation energy fitted from experimental data of IDT is about ~108 kJ/mol.\nFigure 34. Comparison between measured (from Dunphy and Simmie, 1991) and predicted ignition delay times of ethanol-O2 mixtures for equivalence ratios of 0.5, 2.0 and 1.0 at pressures of 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 bar respectively.\nFigure 35 shows the comparison between measured (from Dunphy and Simmie, 1991) and predicted ignition delay times of ethanol-O2 mixtures for equivalence ratio of 0.25 at pressures of 2.0, 3.4 and 4.6 bar.\nIt can be observed that the proposed detailed kinetics model reproduces the ignition delay time dependence with the pressure for lean ethanol-O2 mixtures. However, again, the predicted apparent activation energy is higher than the measurements suggest. A multiple regression was performed in the temperature range of 1700 K - 1300 K and pressures of 2.0, 3.4 and 4.6 bar, for a stoichiometric ratio of 0.25, resulting in the fitted expressions:\nt/ps = 10 2.02 exp^+12.36 kJ/mo//^^^(pbar)\t\u2019 Exp. fit, Dunphy and Simmie (1991).\nt / ps = 10-3.73exp r+16.69 kJ/mol/T^ipbar)\t\u2019 Proposed model, this work.\nThe proposed model is able to describe the pressure dependence but overestimates the global activation energy in about ~4.2 kJ/mol, for lean ethanol-air mixtures.\nFigure 35. Comparison between measured (from Dunphy and Simmie, 1991) and predicted ignition delay times of ethanol-O2 mixtures for f = 0.25 at pressures of 2.0, 3.4 and 4.6 bar.\n4.1.4\tSensitivity Analysis\nA first-order sensitivity analysis of the effect of each reaction on temperature, OH, H2O2, and C2H5OH concentrations was performed to find out which reactions dominate the ethanol oxidation at high pressures and also which reaction coefficients need to be systematically improved. For the analysis, we assumed that the combustion process occurred in a perfectly stirred reactor PSR at conditions behind the reflected shock wave starting at time t = 0 and ending at t = Ting.\nThe conditions for simulations in the PSR were: stoichiometric composition (f = 1.0), pressures of 10, 30 and 50 bar and temperatures of 1100, 950, and 800 K. The overall sensitivity methodology discussed earlier was generated from the output files from CHEMKIN. For each condition analyzed (pair p,T), the reaction with the largest positive effect on the variables analyzed is denoted as Reaction (+) (largest positive value of sensitivity coefficient), whereas that with the largest negative effect is denoted as Reaction (-) (largest negative value of sensitivity coefficient), i.e., only one level of importance is presented. The results are summarized in Table 14.\nTable 14.

It seems that at high pressures the main ethanol oxidation path is dominated by the H-atom abstraction by the hydroperoxy radical (HO2), producing CH3CHOH (named SC2H5O in this work), one of the three isomers of C2H5O.\nThis route corresponds to reaction (R21) above and is represented schematically in the top part of Figure 36. It leads to the hydrogen peroxide sub-mechanism. In the bottom part of Figure 36, the Hs-abstraction path by collision with a third-body \u201cM\u201d is represented. This path results, also, in the production of CH3CHOH which is then oxidized forming acetaldehyde, leading to the acetaldehyde sub-mechanism, and HO2. This corresponds to reaction (R22) above.\nThe hydroperoxy radical (HO2) feeds reaction (R21) giving more CH3CHOH, forming a cycle for the production of CH3CHOH and HO2 and depletion of ethanol. (R23) becomes relevant when the pool of HO2 is formed. The reaction proceeds and more SC2H5O is produced. With the increase of the HO2 concentration, reaction (R24) becomes important.\nFigure 36. Main ethanol oxidation routes at high pressure.\n4.2\tMulti-component gasoline surrogates\nIn this section, detailed kinetics models for several gasoline surrogates are presented. These models are validated against measurements for Gasoline Surrogates A and B and other experimental data of ignition delay time available in the literature.

(1998)\nThe initial kinetics model for the studied surrogates was the PRF model of Curran et al. (1998). In order to simulate the gasoline surrogate A, designed as GS-A model, the PRF model of Curran (1998) was combined with the ethanol kinetics from Cancino et al. (2009b) In order to describe the chemical kinetics of ethanol oxidation in surrogate C, the Marinov (1999) mechanism was used and introduced in the PRF model of Curran, giving the kinetics mechanism GS-C (see Table 16). For the kinetics mechanism GS-B which describes the ignition behavior of surrogate B, the mechanism GS-C was used and upgraded by adding the sub-mechanism for toluene of Andrae et al. (2007). For simulation of gasoline surrogate D, the PRF model of Curran (1998) was combined with the sub-mechanism of toluene of Maurice (1996). Finally GS-E model for the gasoline surrogate E was built by using the kinetics for toluene, ethanol and di-isobutylene from Andrae et al. (2007), Marinov (1999) and Metcalfe et al. (2007) respectively. For abbreviations and references of the used mechanism see Table 15 and Table 16.\nThe proposed detailed kinetics models in this work were tailored in a progressive form, depending of the availability of the kinetics sub structures at literature, since the gasoline surrogate models GS-B, GS-C, GS-D and GS-E were built in the first stages of the development of this work, they used the Marinov model for ethanol instead of the upgraded model of Cancino et al. (2009)\n4.2.1\tDetailed kinetics model for ternary gasoline surrogate mixtures\nA detailed kinetics model for ternary gasoline surrogate involving ethanol, iso-octane and n-heptane, gasoline surrogate A, is proposed here and named GS-A in Table 15 and Table 16. The chemical species were selected based on the availability of detailed chemistry in the literature, especially, the detailed work by Curran et al. (1998). The starting point was the PRF model of Curran et al. (1998). The chemical kinetics of ethanol oxidation was taken from Cancino et al (2009b), which is an upgraded chemistry of ethanol based on Marinov (1999) and Konnov (2000) kinetics mechanisms.\n4.2.1.1\tDetailed kinetics model GS-A for Gasoline surrogate A\nFigure 37 shows the numerical and experimental results for the binary mixture investigated in section 3.3.2. The PRF model of Curran et al. (1998) overestimates the values of ignition delay time in the temperature range of this study. The GS-A model underestimates\nthe values of ignition delay time for temperatures about ~1050 K. It presents a slight change in inflection in the range of temperature for which the PRF model presents an NTC behavior (Curran et al., 1998).\nFigure 37. Comparison between the predictions of the PRF model of Curran et al. (1998), the GS-A model and the measurements of ignition delay time for ethanol - iso-octane (25%/75%) in air.\nAdding the upgraded ethanol chemistry, the performance of the resulting detailed kinetics model GS-A improves. The improvement can be observed in the values of the apparent pre-exponential factor and in the activation energy predicted by the numerical models when compared to the fitted data from experiments in section 3.3.2. The curve fitted expressions are:\nt/ps = 10-2.15exp^+100.77 kJ/m<o/^^\t, PRF model Curran et al. (1998).\nt/ps = 10-3.14 exp^+108.87 kJ/mo/l/r]\t, GS-A model, this work.\nt/ps = 10-3.10exp107.96 kJ/mo/^^ , Experimental fit, this work.\nThe PRF model of Curran et al. (1998) underestimates the global activation energy in about ~5 kJ/mol and the pre-exponential factor is about ~9 times higher. Comparing the experimental results to the proposed model GS-A, the model underestimates the activation energy in about ~0.6 kJ/mol and the pre-exponential factor is about ~10% lower that the experimental value.\nFor consistency, the model GS-A is checked against the measurements for pure ethanol. Figure 38 shows the numerical predictions of ignition delay time for ethanol-air mixtures at stoichiometric composition, at pressures of 10, 30 and 50 bar for both the Curran PRF model and the GS-A model, compared to the measurements reported in section 3.3.1.\n=L\n(D\n\u00a3\n\u2022 1\u201c\n<D\n10000\n\tEthanol-air\tz z\ts\t\n\t\u00bf = 1.0\t/\t\t\n\t\t7/\tT 5\t\n\t' \u2022 /\t\t\n\tZ\t\u25a0 \u2019\tF\t\t\n1000\t'\t\u25a0 \u2019\u00cd '7 //\t7 s\t\n\t/ \u00bf 7 7/\t\u25a0 Exp 10 bar - This work\t\n\t' *'\u2022'/ v/\t\u2022 Exp 30 bar - This work\t\n\t\u2022 \u2019 z' 7\t/ /\t4 Exp 50 bar - This work\t\n100\tj '7 j 77\t\tNum 10 bar - Curran PRF Model\t\n\t\t\tNum\t30 bar - Curran PRF Model\t\n\t\tNum 50 bar - Curran PRF Model\t\n\t\tNum 10 bar - GS-A model, this work\t\n\t\tNum 30 bar - GS-A model, this work\t\n\t\tNum 50 bar - GS-A model, this work\t\n10 H\u2014\u25a0\u2014i\u2014\u25a0\u2014i\u20141\u2014i\u20141\u2014i\u20141\u2014i\u20141\u2014i\u2014\u25a0\u2014i\u2014\u25a0\u2014i\u2014\u25a0\u2014i\u2014\u25a0\u2014I\n0.80\t0.85\t0.90\t0.95\t1.00\t1.05\t1.10\t1.15\t1.20\t1.25\t1.30\n1000K/T\nFigure 38. Comparison between the predictions of the PRF model of Curran et al. (1998), the GS-A model and the measurements for pure ethanol.\nThe Curran PRF model was developed specifically for iso-octane and n-heptane fuels and it was expected that the PRF model would fail in the predictions of ignition delay times for ethanol-air mixtures, especially at temperatures below 1000 K.\nA possible explanation of this flaw is based in the small kinetics data-set for ethanol decomposition in the PRF model. Also, the PRF model does not reproduce the flattening of the IDT observed at lower temperatures.\nAt temperatures above 950 K, however, although it overestimates the measurements, the PRF model is sensitive to the pressure dependence of the ignition delay time and reproduces, approximately, the measured apparent activation energy as shown in the fitted expressions:\nt/ps = 10 2.90 exp^+131.20\tpbar)\t\u2019 Exp., this work, T > 950 K\nt/ps = 10-2.68 exp^+135.96 kJ/mOl'^T^(/''bar)\t, GS-A model, this work, T > 950 K.\nt/ps = 10-3.89exp^+147.98 kJ/mo/^T](pbar)\t, PRF, Curran et al. (1998), T > 950 K.\nAfter adding the ethanol chemistry, the resulting kinetics model is able to reproduce ignition delay times for ethanol-air mixtures.\nGS-A model can also be tested against measurements for pure octane. Figure 39 presents the numerical predictions of both, the Curran PRF model and the GS-A model for iso-octane / air mixtures at pressures of 16.8 and 49.4 bar, temperatures between 950 - 1200 K and stoichiometric composition. The measurements were obtained from Davidson et al. (2005).\nFigure 39. Comparison between the predictions of the PRF model of Curran et al. (1998), the GS-A model and the measurements for pure iso-octane from Davidson et al. (2005).\nThe fitted equations with the characteristics of global activation energy and preexponential factor of the experimental data from Davidson et al. (2005) and for the numerical model of Curran et al. (1998) and GS-A model are:\nFor pressure of 16.8 bar,\nt / p.s = 10-2.19 exp (\t'+102.35 kJ/mol\tA KT J\t, Experimental fit, Davidson et al.

The GS-A model underestimates the measurements at higher temperatures and also underestimates the apparent activation energy. However, the proposed (GS-A) model captures the general trends of the experiments.\n4.2.2\tDetailed kinetics models for quaternary gasoline surrogate mixtures\n4.2.2.1\tDetailed kinetics model GS-B for Gasoline Surrogate B\nThe base mechanism for GS-B is the primary reference fuel model (PRF) of Curran et al. (1998), and sub-mechanisms were incorporated to account for the effect of ethanol and/or toluene.\nThe results of the ignition delay time experiments and simulation for surrogate B are depicted in Figure 40. The measurements show the same flattening for temperatures below 900 K observed for the ethanol/iso-octane mixtures.\nThe predictions using mechanism GS-B results in similar apparent activation energy and reproduces the plateau at low temperatures, especially at high pressures. At higher temperatures (&lt;1000 K) the fitted equations scaled to 30 bar are:\nT / ^s = 10 3.43\nexp\n+142.84 kJ/mol A\nKT J\nExperimental fit, T > 1000 K\nt/^s = 10 2.15\nexp\n+126.08 kJ/mol A\nKT J\n, GS-B model, T > 1000 K\nFigure 40. Simulation and measurements for surrogate B ignition delay times in air for f =\n1.0, p = 10, 30, and 50 bar (see Table 15 and Table 16 for composition and submechanisms).\nThe mechanism describing surrogate GS-B was also checked, for its capability in reproducing the ignition delay times of the pure components. The mechanism captured for example quantitatively the results of toluene and the maximum error quoted was about 6 % in relation to the Andrae et al. (2007) model. However, both predictions deviate strongly from the measurements by Davidson et al. (2005). Figure 41 shows the comparison.\nFigure 41. Experimental and numerical data of ignition delay time of toluene-air mixtures at pressure of 17 bar and stoichiometric composition.\nIn the high temperature range, above 1050 K, the proposed detailed kinetics model GS-B as well as the Andrae et al. (2007) model overestimates the global activation energy in about ~33 kJ/mol, when compared to the experimental data in the same temperature range. The GS-B model and the Andrae model overestimates the pre-exponential factor in about ~28 times the value of the experimental fit from Davidson et al. (2005). The curve fitted equations are:\nt/qs = 10-0.43exp^+73.44 kJ/m(/^^ , Exp. fit, Davidson et al. (2005). (T > 1050 K). t/qs = 10-1.88exp^+106.00 kJ/m</^T, GS-B model, this work. (T > 1050 K). t/qs = 10-1.92exp^+107.18\t, Toluene, Andrae et al. (2007). (T > 1050 K).\nThe reasons for the discrepancy at lower temperatures were not exploded here.\n4.2.2.2\tDetailed kinetics model GS-C for Gasoline Surrogate C\nFigure 42 combines the simulation results using mechanism GS-C with the measurements reported by Fikri et al. (2008). The GS-C model reproduces most of the trends exhibited by the measurements, especially for the higher pressures.\nFigure 42. Simulation and experimental results (from Fikri et al., 2008) for surrogate C ignition delay times in air. f = 1.0 (see Table 15 and Table 16 for composition and submechanisms models).\nIn the high temperature range, above 950 K, the global activation energy and the preexponential factor predicted by the GS-C model agree well with the experimental results as shown in the fitted expressions:\nt/ps = 10-1.37exp^+100.58 kJ/mo/l'^^(/'bar)\t, Exp. fit, Fikri et al. (2008), T > 950 K\nt/ps = 10-1.69exp^+118.72 kJ/mo/^T](pbar)\t\u2019 GS-C model, T > 950 K\nThe GS-C model over predicts the ignition delay at low temperatures. At 10 bar, however, the autoignition delay times is over predicted at intermediate temperatures. Further experimental work including key species time-history measurements of OH (for example from CH3CH2OH) is desired to further improve the understanding of the relative effects of the submechanisms used in the blending process.\n4.2.2.3\tDetailed kinetics model GS-D for Gasoline Surrogate D\nFigure 43 presents the comparison between the simulations obtained with the blended mechanism GS-D (Table 16) and the measurements reported by Gauthier et al (2004). The GS-D model overestimates the measured ignition delay, but still represents the pressure\nFigure 43. Simulation and experimental results (from Gauthier et al., 2004) for surrogate D ignition delay times in air. $ = 1.0 (see Table 15 and Table 16 for composition and submechanisms models)\nFor temperatures above 950 K, the proposed detailed kinetics model GS-D is able to predict the pressure dependence, and the apparent activation energy is about ~6 kJ/mol higher that the fitted value obtained from experiments, as shown in the fitted expressions:\nt/ps = 10-0'98 exp^+100.22 kJ/mo}/r)(pbax)\t,Exp. fit, Gauthier et al. (2004), T > 950 K\nt/ps = 10 9 exp^+111.46 kJ/m\u00b0^T^(bar)\t,GS-D model, T > 950 K\n4.2.2.4\tDetailed kinetics model GS-E for Gasoline Surrogate E\nThe kinetics model GS-E is based on the primary reference fuels model (PRF) of Curran et al. (1998) which accounts for the n-heptane/iso-octane chemistry assembled with specific sub-structures for toluene from Andrae et al. (2007), di-isobutylene from Metcalfe et al. (2007), and ethanol from Marinov (1999).\nFor the validation of the chemical kinetics model GS-E, the results from Fikri et al (2008) of the quaternary gasoline surrogate comprised of toluene / iso-octane / n-heptane / diisobutylene (45% / 25% / 20% / 10% by liquid volume) were used. Both experimental and simulation results are shown in Figure 44.\nFigure 44. Experimental results from Fikri et al. (2008) and simulation for the gasoline surrogate E comprised of toluene / iso-octane / n-heptane / di-isobutylene at composition of 45% / 25% / 20% / 10% by liquid volume.\nThe proposed kinetics model renders the trend of the auto-ignition, but it does not capture the absolute values. The fitted expressions,\nt/ps = 101.36 exp^+63.66 kJ/m</^7pbar)\t,Exp. fit, Fikri et al.

The difference in the pre-exponential factor is a result of the \u201cshift\u201d in the ignition delay time predictions.\n4.2.3\tComparison between GS-B, GS-C and GS-D detailed kinetics models.\nUsing the pressure scaling to p5 = 30 bar, equation [47], and using the respective scaling factors reported in Fikri et al. (2008), Gauthier et al. (2004) and in this work, all the measurements can be collapsed into a single graph and compared to the predictions using models GS-B, GS-C, and GS-D. This is presented in Figure 45. The figure shows that the predictions over estimate the measurements especially at lower temperatures.\n\t100000\t\tGS-B,\tON = 98.8 \tGS-C, ON = 92 GS-D, ON = 87\ncn zt\t\t\n\\\t10000\t\nIs*\t\t\n(l>\t\t\ns\t\tX *\n\t\t\n4\u2014\u2022\t\t\n\t1000\t\n75\t\t\n\u2019O\t\t\no\t\t\n\u2022 i-H 4\u2014*\t100\t* \u2022\n\t\t\nso\t\t\n1\u20141\t\t\n\t10\t\n\u2022 GS-B Exp. this work\n\u25a0 GS-C Exp.

The model GS-C does not reproduce the same trend exhibited by the measurements.\nFor surrogate D, no experimental data is available in the low-temperature range, whereas GS-D model predicts a flattening of the ignition delay time in the lower temperature range.

The GS-C and GS-D models are in good agreement in relation to the apparent activation energy and pre-exponential factor.\nFurther comparison with measurements from Andrae et al. (2007) show that this mechanism does not work well, see Cancino et al. (2009a).\nTherefore, further improvement of this mechanism is required, by validating it against experimental data for wider range of temperature and pressure. Also, the ethanol submechanism of Marinov (1999) does not give satisfactory results at high pressures and intermediate temperatures as shown in Figure 31, and further refinements are needed.\nAn analysis of the important reactions may help to the optimization of the mechanism. The kernel of the ignition chemistry for hydrocarbon fuels is centered around three elementary reactions (Risberg, 2006; Westbrook, 2000):\nH' + O2 + M\tHO2' + M\n(R25)\nRH + HO;\tR\u2022 + H2O2\t(R26)\nH2O2 + M\t2OH\u2022 + M\t(R27)\nIn these reactions, RH denotes an alkane, R\u2019 denotes an alkyl radical. The reactions (R25) and (R26) are chain propagating reactions and (R27) is a chain branching reaction, and the most important reaction for the promotion of the hydroxyl radical (OH\u2019) which is a key species to promote ignition. Reaction (R28):\nH + O2\tOH\u2022 + O\t(R28)\nalso plays a significant role for the ignition delay time at temperatures above 1200 K. Below this temperature, and at measured temperatures and pressures, the chemistry is dominated by the termination reaction (R25).\nAccordingly, and to explain the non-consensus of the simulations performed in this work, the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production could be eventually underestimated in the presented mechanisms.\nThe approach of blending sub-mechanisms used in this work, does not consider cross reactions in which a free radical generated from one of the fuels \u201cabstracts\u201d hydrogen from the other fuel. Andrae et al. (2007) presents a detailed kinetics model for Toluene Reference Fuels (TRF) in which cross reactions between toluene and PRF and between iso-octane and n-heptane are contemplated.\nTherefore, the detailed kinetics model of Andrae et al. (2007) was also used to simulate the gasoline surrogates GS-B, GS-C and GS-D investigated in this work. Figure 46 shows the corresponding results.\nFigure 46 shows that the TRF model does not present a clear distinction between the ignition delay times for the gasoline surrogates GS-B, GS-C and GS-D, at temperatures above ~ 950 K. The experiments, however, indicate a difference in this temperature range. The detailed kinetics mechanisms tailored in this work, in contrast, are able to reproduce the experimentally observed difference of the ignition delay times as shown, for instance in Figure 45. Also, the proposed blended mechanisms show that, at low temperatures, the ignition delay times increase with increasing the octane number calculated using a blending program from Shell, (Kalghatgi, 2007), as shown in Figure 45.\n100000^\n<z> zL\n10000\n<D\n\u00a3\n\u2022 1\u201c\n1000\n<D\nT5\n100\n10\n<\u25a0 \u2019j\n\u2022 GS-B Exp. this work\n\u25a0 GS-C Exp.

Thesis - Leonel Rinc\u00f3n Cancino.\nChapter 5: Conclusions and Recommendations\nSeveral conclusions and recommendations can be done at the end of this work. The mayor objective focused to the development and application of detailed chemical kinetics mechanisms for pure ethanol and ethanol containing multi-component gasoline surrogates was reached. The proposed detailed kinetics models were validated against experimental results of ignition delay times for ethanol pure and gasoline surrogates GS-A and GS-B. The experiments were performed in the Laboratory for Combustion and Gasdynamic - IVG at University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany. The conclusions and recommendations of this work are listed separately for each reactive system investigated in this work.\n5.1\tEthanol/air system\nThe final proposed detailed kinetics model for pure ethanol is formed by 136 chemical species and 1136 elementary reactions. Table 13 shows the major characteristics of the detailed kinetics mechanism proposed in this work. The detailed kinetics model predicts the reduced pressure sensitivity of the ignition delay time at higher pressures. Additionally, it predicts the global trend with temperature. No negative temperature coefficient region was detected in the temperature and pressure range analyzed. From the detailed kinetics modeling, a possible main oxidation route for ethanol oxidation at high pressures is suggested, see Figure 36. This route involves the H-atom abstraction from the secondary carbon of the ethanol molecule by reaction with hydroperoxy radical, giving CH3CHOH and H2O2 as major products\nThe sensitivity analysis (discussed in section 2.5.1) revealed that reaction C2H5OH + HO2 = SC2H5O + H2O2 has the largest sensitivity on temperature, OH, H2O2 and C2H5OH concentrations in the whole temperature interval tested. To improve the predictive capability of the kinetics model, the original Arrhenius parameters of this reaction in the Konnov mechanism were altered. The total reaction rate constant for this reaction in the proposed mechanism was formed by the sum of three constants: ka = 1.01*10+18 exp(+41351ZRT), kb = 4.65l0'l29/: JI J7 and kc = 2.45I0'2'TA97. A similar expression for this rate constant was not found in the literature and this is advanced here as a way of better predicting the measurements for higher pressure and lower temperature.\n116\nA more complete comparison of predictions with this reaction mechanism against measurements is recommended, as well as, a more thorough study of the reactions pointed as the most sensitive, especially the reaction C2H5OH + HO2 = SC2H5O + H2O2.\n5.2\tMulti-component Gasoline surrogates/air systems\nIn this work, five detailed kinetics models for multi-component gasoline surrogates are proposed.\nThe first one, named GS-A, was created for ternary mixtures and validated for binary mixtures of iso-octane and ethanol (75% / 25%, by liquid volume). The blended mechanisms were the PRFs (iso-octane and n-heptane) and ethanol based on the kinetics schemes from Curran (1998) and Cancino et al. (2009b) respectively. The proposed detailed kinetics model, GS-A, was validated against experimental results from this work, and against experimental results of ignition delay times in shock tube for the pure fuels available at literature. The numerical results of ignition delay time show good agreement to the experimental data of ethanol and iso-octane available in the literature.\nFor iso-octane/air mixtures, the Curran PRF model overestimates the experimental results, and the discrepancy is more evident at pressures of 16.8 bar. The GS-A model underestimates the experimental results. However, it captures the general trends of the experiments. For the binary mixture analyzed in this work, the PRF model overestimates the values of ignition delay time in the temperature range of this study. Adding the upgraded ethanol chemistry (Cancino et al. 2009b), the performance of the resulting detailed kinetics model improves. The proposed model underestimates the values of ignition delay time for temperatures about ~1050 K.\nThe GS-B model was developed and validated for quaternary mixtures. The model was and built by using the PRF model of Curran et al. (1998), the ethanol kinetics from Marinov (1999) and the Toluene kinetics from Andrae et al. (2007). The mechanism GS-B for the surrogate B (ethanol / iso-octane / n-heptane / toluene - 40% / 37.8% / 10.2% / 12% by liquid volume) predicts similar apparent activation energies for the ignition delay times as the experimental data. It shows, similarly to the experimental data a flattening trend in activation energy at low temperatures especially at high pressures. The mechanism describing surrogate GS-B was also checked against ignition delay times of the pure components. The mechanism captured quantitatively the results of toluene and the maximum error quoted was about 6%.\nThe GS-C model was developed and tested for ternary mixtures. The kinetics model was built by tailoring the PRF model from Curran et al. (1998) and ethanol kinetics from Marinov (1999). The mechanism GS-C, for gasoline surrogate C (ethanol / iso-octane / n-heptane - 20% / 62% / 18%, by liquid volume), results in relative good prediction of the autoignition delay time of surrogate GS-C at three different pressures. The agreement is good in the high-temperature range for the results at 30 and 50 bar but the model overpredicts the ignition delay at low temperatures. At 10 bar, the autoignition delay times is over predicted even at high temperature. However, it can be clearly seen that the mechanism GS-C gives the closest agreement from all mechanisms with respect to the experimental data.\nThe GS-D detailed kinetics model was developed and tested for the gasoline surrogate D (iso-octane / n-heptane / toluene - 69% / 17% / 14%, by liquid volume). The kinetics model was built by tailoring the PRF model of Curran et al. (1998) and toluene kinetics from Maurice (1996).\nThe GS-E detailed kinetics model was developed for quinary mixtures and tested for quaternary mixtures. The kinetics model is based on the primary reference fuels model (PRF) of Curran et al. (1998) which accounts for the n-heptane/iso-octane chemistry assembled with specific sub-structures for toluene from Andrae et al. (2007), di-isobutylene from Metcalfe et al. (2007), and ethanol from Marinov (1999).\nThe ignition delay times are \u201cshifted\u201d in all results for GS-B, GS-C, GS-D and GS-E compared to the experimental results to longer times. Further comparisons of simulated ignition delay times based on the mechanism with the added toluene reactions with experimental data from Andrae et al. (2007) show that this mechanism causes some disagreement in the 900-1200 K range. Therefore, further improvement of this mechanism is required, by validating it against experimental data for wider range of temperature and pressure. Also, the ethanol sub-mechanism of Marinov does not give satisfactory results for the higher pressures. Further experimental work including key species time-history measurements of OH (for example from CH3CH2OH) is desired to further improve the understanding of the relative effects of the submechanisms used in the blending process.\n118\nDevelopment and Application of Detailed Chemical Kinetic Mechanisms for Ethanol Containing Hydrocarbon Fuels.

The experiments were carried out in stoichiometric mixtures in air behind reflected shock waves in a heated high-pressure shock tube. Initial reflected shock conditions were as follows: Temperatures of 690-1200 K, and pressures of 10, 30 and 50 bar, respectively. Ignition delay times were determined from CH* chemiluminescence at 431.5 nm measured at a sidewall location. The experimental results are compared to simulated ignition delay times based on detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms. The main mechanism is based on the primary reference fuels (PRF) model, and sub-mechanisms were incorporated to account for the effect of ethanol and/or toluene. The simulations are also compared to experimental ignition-delay data from the literature for ethanol/iso-octane/w-heptane (20%/62%/18% by liquid volume) and iso-octane/w-heptane/toluene (69%/17%/14% by liquid volume) surrogate fuels. The relative behavior of the ignition delay times of the different surrogates was well predicted, but the simulations overestimate the ignition delay, mostly at low temperatures.\nCrown copyright \u00a9 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Combustion Institute.

Special emphasis is set on ethanol, because of its high availability. It has also been used as an octane-boosting, pollution-reducing additive for gasoline [1]. Countries like Brazil have a long history in\n1540-7489/$ - see front matter Crown copyright \u00a9 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Combustion Institute.

So-called flex engines have been developed to cope with strongly varying fuel compositions [2]. Nevertheless, fundamental studies of the ignition properties of eth-anol-containing model fuels are scarce [3].\nFor the characterization of fuels the autoignition delay is a significant observable and is a critical parameter for IC engines. It influences the performance of both compression-ignition (CI) and spark-ignition (SI) engines. In CI and homogeneous-charge compression-ignition (HCCI) engines, the combustion process is initiated by autoignition. Therefore, it is crucial to know \u2018\u2018when\u201d ignition will occur. In SI engines, autoignition causes knock which limits the accessibility of the most efficient engine operation regimes. Therefore, again, it is necessary to know after which residence time a fuel ignites at specific temperatures and pressures.\nSeveral methodologies can be applied to determine ignition delay times (IDTs). Experiments were carried out in shock tubes, rapid-compression machines (RCM), or perfectly stirred reactors (PSR) [3-6]. Here, we study the ignition delay in a shock tube using undiluted homogeneous mixtures of fuel and synthetic air in order to generate validation data for comparison with the results of chemistry models.\nPractical fuels are a complex mixture of various hydrocarbons. Their ignition characteristics are typically described by comparison to those of reference fuels. The traditional comparison to two-component fuels (n-heptane/iso-octane defining the octane number ON) has shown weaknesses for the operating conditions of modern IC engines. Therefore, more complicated surrogate fuels have been developed. Detailed chemical mechanisms for ignition and combustion of reference fuels can then be included in engine simulations.\nValidation and optimization of such models depend on the availability of experimental data, particularly on IDTs. Recently, models have been developed for fuel surrogates such as n-heptane/ toluene [7]. Yahyaoui et al. studied the oxidation of iso-octane/toluene/1-hexane/ETBE mixtures in a jet stirred reactor [8]. The experimental data have been used to validate a new detailed chemical kinetics mechanism including cross-reactions [5,7]. The same group studied the autoignition of a binary mixture of 1-hexene and toluene in a shock\ntube in the 750-1860 K temperature and 210 bar pressure range [9]. Studies of other relevant mixtures containing aromatics, olefins and ethanol are just appearing [5,7]. Recently, Fikri et al. [3] measured the ignition delay times for various shock-heated mixtures of two multi-component model fuels in air. The fuels were comprised of n-heptane/iso-octane/ethanol and n-heptane/tolu-ene/iso-octane/diisobutylene (18%/62%/20% and 20%/45%/25%/10% by liquid volume, respectively). The fuels have similar research octane numbers (RON 95) and motor octane numbers (MON 85) that correspond to the standard European gasoline. Gauthier et al. [4] investigated the ignition-delay time of gasoline behind reflected shock waves and compared them to the results of two gasoline surrogates comprised of iso-octane/toluene/n-heptane by keeping the n-hep-tane fraction constant and varying the iso-octane/toluene proportion. The optimized surrogates showed a good agreement to real gasoline in terms of IDTs.\nThe previous studies have thus focused on hydrocarbon-based fuels with either toluene or ethanol. Surrogates containing both components have not yet been studied. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to provide experimental data for fuel surrogates containing ethanol as well as toluene for the development of chemical kinetic models for gasoline/ethanol mixtures. We therefore studied the behavior of a four-component fuel (called \u2018\u2018Surrogate A\u201d in this paper) of etha-nol/iso-octane/n-heptane/toluene (40%/37.8%/ 10.2%/12% by liquid volume) behind reflected shock waves. Our model results are additionally compared to the literature data for surrogate fuels based on a primary reference fuel containing ethanol [3] or toluene [4] (called \u2018\u2018Surrogate B\u201d and \u2018\u2018Surrogate C\u201d in this paper, resp.). Table 1 summarizes the composition of the three surrogates. The respective octane numbers have been calculated using a blending program from Shell [10].\nThe numerical simulations were done using the SHOCK package of CHEMKIN [11]. The detailed kinetic models tailored in this work use the PRF model of Curran et al. [6] for iso-octane/n-heptane chemistry as a \u2018\u2018kernel\u201d. This PRF model is the result of the improvement and of several detailed kinetics models developed for hydrocarbons containing up to eight carbon atoms in the molecular structure [6]. The PRF\nTable 1\nComposition of the gasoline surrogates (GS) investigated in this study\nGasoline surrogate\tComposition liquid volume (%)\t\t\t\tOctane number\n\tEthanol\tIso-octane\tn-Heptane\tToluene\t\nSurrogate A\t40.0\t37.8\t10.2\t12.0\t98.75 [10]\nSurrogate B [3]\t20.0\t62.0\t18.0\t**\t92.0 [10]\nSurrogate C [4]\t**\t69.0\t17.0\t14.0\t87.0 [10]\nkinetic model has been tested and validated against various experimental data [6]. Sub-mechanisms for toluene and/or ethanol were embedded into the PRF mechanism to expand its applicability to a larger variety of fuels. The blending procedure that carefully adds selected additional reactions to the base mechanisms is described in the section \u2018\u2018chemistry modeling\u201d. This work is the first contribution for the optimization process of kinetic models involving ethanol, iso-octane, n-heptane, and toluene.\n2.\tExperimental\nThe experiments were carried out in a high-pressure shock tube with an internal diameter of 90 mm. It is divided by an aluminum diaphragm into a driver section of 6.1 m and a driven section of 6.4 m in length. The driven section was pumped down to pressures below 10 2 mbar. Gas mixtures were prepared by injection of a liquid mixture and subsequent complete evaporation in a stainless-steel mixing vessel. The total amount of fuel and air was controlled manomet-rically in order to ensure the desired equivalence ratio. The shock speed was measured over two intervals using three piezo-electric pressure gauges. The data were recorded with a time resolution of 0.1 ps. The temperature and pressure behind the reflected shock wave were computed from the measured incident shock speed and the attenuation using a one-dimensional shocktube model (CHEMKIN [11]). The estimated uncertainty in reflected shock temperature is less than \u00b125 K in the temperature and time range of our measurements. The experiments were carried out in synthetic air containing 79.5% N2 and 20.5% O2 by volume.\nThe model calculations used here are based on an isochoric assumption. The first stage of preignition, however, causes indeed a slight pressure increase, which can expand in the form of a non-stationary wave thus influencing the ignition behavior. In the crucial case (long time observation related to low-to-intermediate temperature) the maximum temperature increase was estimated to be 20 K which is within the error estimated in the uncertainty. Moreover, we should mention that small changes in temperature are most relevant to measurements at low temperature and therefore do not dramatically affect the ignition delay times sing in the NTC range. We believe that this effect is to some extent fuel-specific and also dependent on how well the driver gas tailoring was chosen.\nThe ignition was observed behind the reflected shock waves by measuring temporal pressure profiles with a piezo-electric gauge (PCB HM 112 A03) at a side-wall position 15 mm upstream of the endplate. Also, CH* chemiluminescence was\nmeasured at the same position. It was selected by a bandpass filter (431.5 nm, 5 nm HWHM) and detected with a photomultiplier with a time resolution of 1 ps. Ignition delay times were determined by extrapolating either the steepest increase of the CH* emission signal to its zero level on the time axis or the pressure increase due to the ignition. Both procedures yield very similar results (<5% deviation). Here, we use the data obtained from the chemiluminescence measurement. Bifurcation effects are not observed.\nWe used driver gas tailoring to extend the observation time to a maximum of 15 ms to allow for measurements of the IDTs at low temperatures. The driver gas was mixed in situ by using two high-pressure mass-flow controllers (Bronk-horst Hi-Tec flow meter). Helium was used as the main component and 5-20% argon was added to match the acoustic impedance of the test gas. The composition was calculated for each experimental condition using equations by Oertel [12] and Palmer and Knox [13].\n3.\tChemistry modeling\nSeveral detailed kinetic mechanisms for different hydrocarbons and blends of primary reference fuels (PRF) are available in the literature [6,14,15]. In this work, three different mechanisms were taken into account and tailored for the specific gasoline surrogates. The \u2018\u2018adaptation process\u201d of the kinetic models is based on blending of different sub-mechanisms for the different fuel compounds. This process requires a sequence of steps to construct the final detailed kinetic model that are outlined for the combination of two mechanisms below:\n1.\tAnalyze and potentially adjust the kinetic information of both mechanisms for their use in CHEMKIN.\n2.\tCheck the species names in both mechanisms and remove duplicate reactions from the second (minor) mechanism.\n3.\tAdd the missing reactions into the major mechanism.\n4.\tCheck the thermodynamic data base of the major mechanism and upgrade it with data for the missing species.\n5.\tTest the blended kinetic model with the CHEMKIN interpreter and validate it against measured IDTs. To make sure that the added reactions for an additional fuel component do not change the behavior of the mechanism in case this component is not present.\n6.\tOptimize the blended kinetic mechanism: Determine the rate-determining route for autoignition via a sensitivity analysis and figure out whether the major reactions have reliable (directly measured) kinetic data.\nTable 2\nCharacteristics of the detailed kinetic mechanisms adapted to the surrogate fuels investigated in this work\n\tMechanism\tBlended mechanism\tReference\nSurrogate A\tGS-A\tEthanol\t[1]\n\t\tToluene\t[18]\nSurrogate B\tGS-B\tEthanol\t[1]\nSurrogate C\tGS-C\tToluene\t[17]\nThe adopted mechanisms used for the surrogates A, B, and C were tailored by incorporating the mechanisms given in the third column into the PRF mechanism [6].\nThe blending procedure is time consuming. If two chemical species have the same chemical formula, it is necessary to check their thermodynamic databases by comparing the enthalpy h, heat capacity cp, and entropy s at several temperature values. If their thermodynamic properties return the same (or similar) values, then both chemical species are identical despite different names or abbreviations used in the original kinetic models.\nThese steps require the utilization of computational tools. In this work the programs of Rolland and Simmie [16] were used to compare the kinetics mechanisms and thermodynamic databases.\n3.1.\tTailored kinetic models for gasoline surrogates\nThree detailed kinetic mechanisms were adapted to simulate the IDTs of different gasoline surrogates with the compositions and characteristics given in Table 1. Table 2 summarizes the origin of the sub-mechanisms. The full mechanisms are available as Supplementary material from the combustion symposium website.\nThe initial kinetic model tailored for the studied surrogates was the PRF model of Curran et al. [6]. To describe the chemical kinetics of ethanol oxidation, the Marinov mechanism was used [1] and introduced in the PRF model of Curran, giving the kinetic mechanism GS-B to simulate the ignition delay times of surrogate B (see Table 2). For the elaboration of the kinetic mechanism GS-A which describes the ignition behavior of surrogate A, the mechanism GS-B was used and upgraded by adding the sub-mechanism for toluene of Andrae et al. [18]. Finally, to simulate the gasoline surrogate C, the kinetic model GS-C was designed. Here, the PRF model of Curran was combined with the sub-mechanism of toluene of Maurice [17]. For abbreviations and references of the used mechanism see Tables 1 and 2.\n4.\tResults and discussion\nThis work combines experimental and simulated ignition delay times for gasoline surrogates that contain toluene and/or ethanol. The simulations are based on different blended mechanisms.\nThus, the comparison to experimental data allows to choose the most appropriate modeling approaches. The results are parceled in groups and presented in the following order: (i) presentation of the new experimental results for surrogate A and comparison with simulations, (ii) simulation of the IDTs of surrogate B, and (iii) ignition delay results for gasoline surrogate C in comparison to experimental data from the literature [3,4].\n4.1.\tResults for surrogate A\nThe temperature range of the present study was 690 &lt;T &lt;1200 K and target pressures were 10 \u00b1 2, 30 \u00b1 2 and 50 \u00b1 2 bar. All measurements were carried out at / = 1. Typical pressure and CH* emission profiles are shown in Fig. 1 for an experiment at T = 764 K, p = 31.5 bar and / = 1.0. The two-step increase in pressure is due to the incident and reflected shock wave (time zero) followed by a constant pressure for about 4750 ps. The CH* emission (lower part of Fig. 1) remains at zero level for 4750 ps, followed by a steep rise that indicates ignition. Ignition delay times shown here are based on an extrapolation of the increase in CH* chemiluminescence emission to the zero level.\nThe results and simulations of the IDT experiments for surrogate A are presented in Table 3 and depicted in Fig. 2. For this data set the onset\nTime / ms\nFig. 1.

The mechanism captured for example quantitatively the results of toluene and the maximum error quoted was about 6%.\n4.2.\tResults for surrogate B\nFigure 3 combines our simulation results with the experimental data reported by Fikri et al. [3]. The lines depict the results of the simulation using the primary reference fuel mechanism of Curran in combination with the Marinov mechanism describing the ethanol oxidation. The new model does a relatively good job in predicting the autoignition delay time of surrogate B at three different pressures. The agreement is good in the high-temperature range for the results at 30 and 50 bar. The model over predicts the ignition delay at low temperatures. At 10 bar, however, the autoignition delay times is over predicted even at high temperature. The model does not capture the experimental results obtained from the shock tube at this pressure.\nIt can be clearly seen that the mechanism GS-B gives the closest agreement from all mechanisms with respect to the experimental data. Further experimental work including key species time-history measurements of OH (for example from CH3CH2OH) is desired to further improve the understanding of the relative effects of the submechanisms used in the blending process.\n4.3.\tResults for surrogate C\nFigure 4 shows the simulations obtained with the blended mechanism GS-C (Table 2) and the experimental data reported by Gauthier et al.\nFig. 4. Simulation and experimental results (from [4]) for surrogate C ignition delay times in air. / = 1.0 (see Tables 1 and 2 for composition and sub-mechanisms models).\nFig. 5. Simulation and experimental results for all surrogates/air ignition delay times at p5 = 30 bar. / = 1.0 (see Tables 1 and 2 for composition and submechanisms models).\n[4]. It is clearly seen, that the model also overestimates the measured ignition delay, but is still sensitive to the pressure dependence.\nAll detailed kinetic models GS-A, GS-B, and GS-C overestimate the IDTs. Figure 5 shows the experimental data scaled to p5 = 30 bar using their respective scaling factors reported in [3,4] and the numerical simulation for the same pressure level for all surrogates. The data show a slight NTC behavior between 800 and 690 K for surrogates B which is also predicted by the simulation. For surrogate A the experiments indicate a weak NTC effect which is not shown by the simulation. Further experimental data are required to investigate this discrepancy.\nFor the surrogate GS-C no experimental data are available in the low-temperature range, however, the detailed kinetic model for this surrogate predicts a negative temperature behavior in this temperature range (dotted line). Despite these discrepancies in ignition delay times, the models cap\nture the trends of the experiments. The ignition delay times are \u2018\u2018shifted\u201d in all cases compared to the experimental results to longer times. Further comparisons of simulated ignition delay times based on the mechanism with the added toluene reactions with experimental data from [18] show that this mechanism causes some disagreement in the 900-1200 K range. Therefore, further improvement of this mechanism is required, by validating it against experimental data for wide range of temperature and pressure.\nAlso, the ethanol sub-mechanism of Marinov does not give satisfactory results in our application and further refinements are needed. A sensitivity analysis of the two mechanisms is in progress. The results will shed light onto the key reactions which have the largest impact on the autoignition.\nThe kernel of the ignition chemistry is centered around three elementary reactions [19]:\nH' + O2 + M ! HO2 + M\t(R1)\nRH + HO2 ! R' + H2O2\t(R2)\nH2O2 + M ! 2OH' + M\t(R3)\nIn these reactions, RH denotes an alkane, R denotes an alkyl radical. The reactions (R1) and (R2) are chain propagating reactions and (R3) is a chain branching reaction, and the most important reaction for the promotion of the hydroxyl radical (OH) which is a key species to promote ignition [20]. The reaction (R4):\nH + O2 ! OH' + O\t(R4)\nalso plays a significant role for the IDT at temperatures above 1200 K. Below this temperature and at measured temperatures and pressures the chemistry is dominated by (R1). Accordingly, and to explain the non-consensus of the simulations in this work, the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production could be eventually underestimated in the presented mechanisms.\nOur approach of blending sub-mechanisms does not consider cross-reactions in which a free radical generated from one of the fuels \u2018\u2018abstracts\u201d hydrogen from the other fuel [18]. Andrae et al. [18] present a detailed kinetic model for toluene reference fuels (TRF), in which crossreactions between toluene and PRF and between iso-octane and n-heptane are contemplated. Therefore, the detailed kinetic model of Andrae et al. [18] was also used to simulate the three gasoline surrogates investigated in this work. Figure 6 shows the results. Figure 7 compares the simulated ignition delay times with and without considering the cross-reactions from the Andrae model. One can clearly see that under these conditions cross-reactions are insignificant which agrees with the observation by Andrae et al. [18]. The TRF model does not show a clear difference\nFig. 6. Simulation and experimental results for all surrogates/air ignition delay times at p5 = 30 bar. / = 1.0 - comparison with the results of the toluene reference fuel mechanism (TRF) of Andrae et al. [18],\ngations at low temperature, tailoring of the driver gas was necessary to extend the observation time. The experiments were carried out at stoichiometric (/ = 1) conditions at pressures of 10, 30 and 50 bar. IDTs were evaluated using side-wall detection of CH* chemiluminescence (k = 431.5 nm).\nDetailed kinetics modeling was used to simulate the autoignition of surrogate A and two other gasoline surrogates (surrogate B: ethanol/iso-octane/n-heptane: 20%/62%/18% by liquid volume, surrogate C: iso-octane/n-heptane/toluene: 69%/17%/14% by liquid volume) based on experimental data from the literature [2,3]. The model was developed by incorporating sub-mechanisms for ethanol and/or toluene oxidation into the primary reference fuel model of Curran et al. [6]. The resulting model shows the right trend but fails to capture absolute values of the ignition delay times, especially at low temperatures. All kinetics models over estimate the ignition delay times.\n1000 K/T\nFig. 7.

The experiments, however, indicate a difference in this temperature range. The detailed kinetic mechanisms tailored in this work in contrast are able to reproduce the experimentally observed difference of the ignition delay times (see Fig. 5). Also, our blended mechanism shows that at low temperature the ignition delay times increase with increasing the octane number calculated using a blending program from Shell [10].\n5.\tSummary and conclusions\nIn this work, ignition delay times of a gasoline surrogate A (ethanol/iso-octane/n-heptane: 40%/ 37.8%/10.2%/12% by liquid volume) have been studied using the Duisburg high-pressure shock tube facility. The investigated post-reflected-shock temperature range was 690-1200 K.

Ignition delay times were measured under stoichiometric conditions at 10, 30, and 50 bar and from 650 to 1220 K. From a multiple linear regression analysis using ln(r) as the dependent variable and (1/T) and ln(p) as independent variables an expression of r/ps = 10-1.79 exp(+12400 K/T) (p/bar)-0'83 was curve fitted for the measured range of temperature, pressure and stoichiometric mixture. The kinetic model was built up by incorporating available submechanisms for ethanol chemistry (Marinov) as well as C3-chemistry (Konnov), taken as central kernel. Additionally, other key reactions obtained from computational chemistry and available on the literature (Lin) were included. For improvement of the model, the sensitivity of each reaction on temperature, OH, H2O2, and C2H5OH concentrations was determined using a perfectly-stirred-reactor assumption for temperatures of 1100, 950, and 800 K at all pressures and stoichiometric mixture. The sensitivity analysis identified a set of important reactions involving the H-atom abstraction from the ethanol molecule by the hydroperoxy radical (HO2), giving CH3CHOH, acetaldehyde and H2O2. The model predicts the global trend with temperature and pressure as well as the lower sensitivity of the ignition delay time with pressure at higher pressures.\n1.\tIntroduction\nThere are several motivations to investigate and learn about the combustion of ethanol. In summary, there is a need of a) alternatives to conventional hydrocarbon fuels, especially from renewable sources, b) reduction of pollutant and carbon emissions from energy and power, and c) additives to control engine knock (Curran et al. (1992)). These needs are grounded on economic and environmental considerations. In the last sixty years, several authors have focused on ethanol oxidation. As results of these efforts a limited quantity of experimental and numerical investigations about ethanol kinetics involving different experimental setup and numerical models is available. From the\npioneering works, using a well-stirred reaction vessel, Barnard and Hughes. (1960) showed that the pyrolysis of ethanol at temperatures between 849 and 897 K can be described as a homogeneous reaction of first order. Gulder. (1982) measured laminar burning speed of ethanol-air in lean and rich mixtures in a constant pressure bomb at pressure of 1 bar and room temperature. More recently, Borizov et al. (1991) used a reaction vessel to experimentally analyze the pyrolysis of ethanol at 1 bar and a temperature range of 700 -1700 K. These results where later complemented by detailed laminar flame and shock tube data. Egolfopoulos et al. (1992) measured laminar burning speed, ignition delay time and chemical species in ethanol/(air/O2) mixtures by using a shock tube, a counter-flow twin flame and a flow reactor. Kohse-Hoinghaus et al. (2007) reported chemical species measurements and flame structure of ethanol/O2 mixtures at 298 K and low pressures (0.05 bar). Natarajan and Bhaskaram (1981) reported ignition delay time measurements in a shock tube for pressures of 1.0 and 2.0 bar and high temperatures. Borizov et al. (1989) measured ignition delay times in ethanol/O2 mixtures by using the shock tube at pressures between 0.5 and 6 bar. Dunphy and Simmie (1991) measured ignition delay times in a shock tube of ethanol/O2 mixtures at high temperatures and pressures of 1.8 to 4.6 bar. Curran et al. (1992) measured ignition delay times of ethanol/O2 mixtures in a shock tube at high temperatures and a pressure of 2.3 bar for lean and rich mixtures. Li et al. (2007) report measurements of stable species in the ethanol oxidation in a variable pressure flow reactor. The measured species were C2H5OH, H2O, C2H4, CH4, CH3CHO, CO and CO2, at pressure range of 3 to 12 bar, initial temperatures from 800 to 950 K and equivalence ratio from 0.3 to\n1.4.\tRecently, the available data was extended to higher pressure. Cancino et al. (2007) reported measurements of ignition delay times in a high pressure shock tube from 690 to 1200 K and pressure of 30 bar. To the author's knowledge, these are the highest pressures reported so far for ethanol oxidation. Detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms have also been developed using these experimental results as guidance. Natarajan and Bhaskaram (1981) reported a detailed kinetic model for the high-temperature oxidation of ethanol containing 56 elementary reactions, including the bimolecular decomposition\nreaction C2H5OH + M CH2OH + CH3 + M, in other words, proposing the C-C cleavage of ethanol. Validation against experimental data of ignition delay time in a shock tube at pressures of 1.0 and 2.0 bar and temperatures between 1300 and 1700 K resulted in good agreement with the pressure dependence. Borizov et al. (1989) and Borizov et al. (1992) reported another detailed kinetic model for the high-temperature ignition of ethanol involving 94 elementary reactions. This kinetic mechanism was built starting from the Natarajan and Bhaskaram (1981) model, adding reactions that describe the pyrolysis of ethanol and some reactions representing the thermal oxidation by active radicals, not considered in the Natarajan model. The model was validated against experimental results of ignition delay time in shock tubes for stoichiometric, lean and rich compositions at pressure of 1 atm and a good agreement was found. In the nineties, Marinov (1999) developed a comprehensive model composed by 383 elementary reactions among 57 chemical species for the high-temperature ethanol oxidation. It included an accurate kinetic data-set for ethanol oxidation, reaction routes involving H-abstraction, C-C and C-O cleavage were proposed and computational chemistry methods were used in order to determine the Arrhenius parameters. It was validated against experimental results of ignition delay time in shock tube, laminar flame speed in counterflow twin flame and chemical species concentrations in jet-stirred reactor. Good agreement was found in general with all measurements. More recently, Saxena and Williams (2007) reported a kinetic model with 288 elementary reactions among 57 chemical species. This model is about 100 elementary reactions smaller than Marinov's and also predicts the nitrogen oxidation chemistry. It was validated against experimental results of ignition delay time in a shock tube at high temperatures (1300 to 1700 K) and pressures of 1.0 and 2.0 bar for stoichiometric, lean and rich ethanol/O2/Ar mixtures. The Saxena model was also validated against laminar burning velocity data from Egolfopoulos et al. (1992). Marinov's and Saxena and William's models were also tested by Li et al. (2007). They proposed an improved detailed kinetic model for pyrolysis and oxidation of ethanol based mostly on their previous work (see references in Li et al. (2007)). Their model consists of 39 chemical species and 238 reversible elementary reactions and was developed in a hierarchical manner. The final mechanism was validated against the experimental results of shock tube from Curran et al. (1992) and\tNatarajan and Bhaskaram (1981),\nlaminar flame from Gulder. (1982) and Egolfopoulos et al. (1992) (from 300 to 450 K), and their own variable pressure flow reactor (temperature from 800 to 950 K, pressure from 3 to 12 bar and equivalence ratio from 0.3 to 1.4). An agreement better than previous models (Marinov (1999) and Saxena and Williams (2007)) was obtained. The comparison with shock tube ignition delay from 2 to 4.5 bar resulted in the same trend of reduction of ignition delay time as presure increases. But, there was a tendency of overpredicting the\nignition delay in the lower temperature range at higher pressure. Numerical studies on ethanol decomposition using computational chemistry have also been reported. They have been useful in completing the gaps on thermodynamic and chemical kinetic parameters as well as in pointing out important reactions and reactions with a very high reaction barrier. Marinov (1999) used RRKM theory to analyze the multichannel decomposition of ethanol. In this study, he determined the reaction rate parameters of the thermal decomposition of ethanol at high temperatures, involving new degradation routes like H-abstraction. These new data permitted to increase the accuracy of the kinetic modeling resulting in a good comparison to a host of experimental data. Recently, Li et al. (2004) found that Marinov's model underestimates the production rate of H2O and C2H4 as well as the overall ethanol consumption. He then presented a new set of Arrhenius parameters for the decomposition reactions; C2II-OII C2H4 + H2O and C2H5OH CH3 + CH2OH. Finally, Lin et al. (2002), Lin et al. (2003) and Lin et al. (2004) published the most recent kinetic data obtained from computational chemistry for the thermal oxidation of ethanol. They provided a new kinetic database allowing for thermal decomposition of ethanol and ethanol-radical reactions. High barrier reactions are detected and critical reactions are identified.\nThis work has two objectives: (1) to report experimental results of shock tube experiments at high pressures and intermediate temperatures for ethanol, which have not been covered in the literature so far, and (2) to propose a detailed kinetic model for the ethanol oxidation obtained by using and improving available kinetic models.\n2.\tChemical reaction pathways for thermal oxidation of ethanol\nThe oxidation of hydrocarbons proceeds either by hydrogen atom abstraction or by cleavage of C-C bonds at primary or secondary carbon atoms. In the case of aliphatic alcohol hydrocarbons, the hydroxyl group plays a very important role for the oxidation and as a third pathway the cleavage of the C-O bond can occur. Any of the three paths follows after a temperature activated perturbation of the energy field of the molecule and proceed either by intramolecular (isomerization), giving several sub-structures, or as a result of collision with active radical species. Several authors have qualitatively described the decomposition of ethanol. Recently, Lin et al. (2002), Lin et al. (2003) and Lin et al. (2004) reported 11 different routes for ethanol decomposition involving reactive radical species. Figure 1 summarizes these major routes. Box I shows the decomposition routes involving methyl giving methane and hydrogen atoms as a product in three routes. Box II depicts H abstraction involving H atoms and producing molecular hydrogen via three routes and additional other unstable species. Box III depicts the H abstraction by a unimolecular self-cleavage process; all routes giving acetaldehyde, molecular and atomic hydrogen. Box IV shows the decomposition process\nby unimolecular self-cleavage, involving the C-C and C-O bonds and the products are formaldehyde, methane and other unstable species. One can clearly see that the pyrolysis of ethanol proceeds by a chain-branching mechanism where free radical species like methyl and H atoms produced in boxes III and IV feed the active radical species for pathways of boxes I and II. Kinetic models of ignition of ethanol/O2, Borizov et al. (1992) and ethanol/air, Cancino and Oliveira (2006), Gardiner (2000) show that during the induction period ethanol is consumed almost completely. The depletion of the fuel is induced by oxidative pyrolysis. Therefore, the ethanol oxidation model capable of describing accumulation of the products during the induction period and the promoter effect on the ignition process must be based on an ethanol pyrolysis mechanism, such as the one described above. Since the pathways depicted in\nFigure 1. Ethanol decomposition pathways\nFigure 1 proceed at different rates depending on the range of temperature and pressure, a careful analysis and comparison to critical experiments may be able to reveal the most important routes at different pressure and temperature regimes. Excluding a single result at 30 bar, the low temperature data has been measured up to 4.5 bar and high temperature data has been measured up to 12 bar. Using the available chemical mechanisms, it has been observed that the predictions overestimate the shock tube ignition delay data at higher pressures. Therefore, questions remain whether the patterns discussed above are still correct for higher pressures and also how the rates of the different paths behave as pressure is increased. In the following, new measurements of ignition delay are presented and compared to an improved detailed chemical kinetic model.\n3.\tExperiments\n3.1.\tExperimental set-up\nThe experiments were carried out in the high-pressure shock tube at the University of Duisburg-Essen. This facility, depicted in Figure 2, has an internal diameter of 90 mm, divided by an aluminum diaphragm into a driver section of 6.1 m and a driven section of 6.4 m in length. The driven section is pumped down to pressures below 10-2 mbar in between the experiments. Gas mixtures were prepared by injecting liquid ethanol into a stainless-steel mixing vessel and subse\nquent complete evaporation and mixing. The total amount of fuel and air was controlled mano-metrically in order to ensure the desired equivalence ratio. The shock tube was heated to 348 K . The shock speed was measured over two intervals using three piezo-electric pressure gauges. Pressure data were recorded with a time resolution of 0.1 ^s. The temperature and pressure behind the reflected shock wave were computed from the measured incident shock speed and the speed attenuation using a one-dimensional shocktube model (shock-tube code of the CHEMKIN package Kee et al. (2000)). The estimated uncertainty in reflected shock temperature is less than 25 K. The experiments were carried out with synthetic air containing 79.5% N2 and 20.5% O2. The ignition was observed by side-wall measurement of pressure profiles with a piezo-electric gauge (PCB HM 112 A03) located 15 mm upstream of the end flange. Also, the CH* emission at 431.5 nm from a side wall was selected by a narrow band pass filter (5 nm HWHM) and detected with a photomultiplier. All ignition delay times shown in this work were determined by extrapolating the steepest increase of the CH* chemiluminescence emission signal to its zero level on the time axis. The driver gas was mixed in-situ by using two high-pressure mass-flow controllers (Bronkhorst Hi-Tec flow meter F-136AI-FZD-55-V and F-123MI-FZD-55-V). Helium was used as the main component and Argon was added to match the acoustic impedance of the test gas. The required driver gas composition was calculated by a spreadsheet analysis prior to the experiments using equations by Oertel (1996) and Palmer and Knox. (1961). Concentrations of 5 to 20% Ar in He were required to generate tailored shock waves.\nFigure 2. Experimental setup of the high-pressure shock tube facility\n3.2.\tMeasured ignition delay times\nThe ignition delay times evaluated from the CH* emission are listed in Table 1 along with the respective pressures p and temperatures T, for stoichiometric ethanol-air mixture. At temperatures lower than those shown in Table 1 no ignition was observed within the test time of our experiment (15 ms). Figure 3 shows the experimental results for ignition delay time as a function of temperature (as an Arrhenius plot) for different pressures and stoichiometric composition. All data was curve-fitted to an equation of the form t = A exp( B / T ) p-x, where x is the pressure exponent. Multiple linear regression analyses\nTable 1.

Experimental and curve fitted ignition delay times for stoichiometric ethanol/air mixture\nusing ln(r) as the dependent variable and (1/T) and ln(p) as independent variables identified an expression of t = 10-1-79 exp(+12400/T) p-0-83, with T in K, p in bar and t in ps, for the measured range of temperature and for a stoichiometric mixture. The curve fitting suggests an apparent activation energy of 24.6 kcal/mol. The fitting is shown in Figure 3. The measurements exhibit a\ndecrease in ignition delay time as the pressure increases. There is also a smaller sensitivity to pressure at higher pressures. The variation with temperature at higher temperature tends to become smaller but the data does not indicate the existence of a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) region. These results are next used as a basis to extend current detailed chemical kinetic models for ethanol oxidation.\n4.\tDetailed chemical kinetic modeling\n4.1.\tModel development\nIn the present work, the Konnov (2000) and Marinov (1999) detailed kinetic models were taken and tailored to build up the proposed model. Initially, the extensively tested kinetic model for small hydrocarbons of Konnov was extended to the combustion of ethanol by adding the reactions described by Marinov that were missing in Konnov's mechanism. Then, in order to further improve the predictive capability of the model, a comprehensive review of the literature was performed and new kinetic data was found in Li et al. (2004), Lin et al. (2002), Lin et al. (2003) and Lin et al. (2004). They allowed for an update of the values of the reaction constants of several elementary reactions involving ethanol. Some elementary reactions that appeared neither in Konnov's nor in Marinov's mechanisms were also added. The adaptation process of the kinetic model was based on blending the different sub-mechanisms for ethanol and other sub-structures from Marinov, Li and Lin et al., that were not taken into account by Konnov, calculating ignition delay times with the subsequently formed mechanisms and comparing the results generated by the modified and base mechanisms. In summary, the model allows the specific reactions for ethanol decomposition of Figure 4. Lin et al. (2002) found that at pressures below\nC2H5OH C2H4+ H2O (1) H+C2H5OH CH3CHOH + H2\nCH3 + CH2OH (2)\nCH3CHO + H2\t(3)\nC2H3OH + H2 (4)\nCH4 + CH2O (5)\n(12)\n(13)\n(14)\n(15)\nC2H4OH + H2\nC2H5O + H2\nC2H5 + H2O\nCH4+ CHOH\t(6) CH3+C2H5OH CH4+ CH3CHOH\t(16)\nCH3CH + H2O (7)\nC2H5 + OH (8)\nC2H5O + H (9)\nCH3CHOH + H (10)\nC2H4OH + H (11)\nCH4 + CH3CH2O (17)\nCH4 + CH2CH2OH (18) CH3OH + CH3CH2 (19)\nH + CH3CH2OCH3 (20)\nFigure 4. Specific reactions for ethanol decomposition\n10 bar, the unimolecular decomposition of ethanol occurs primarily by the dehydration reaction producing C2H4 + H2O, represented by reaction (1). At high-pressure limit and over 1500 K the production of CH3 and CH2OH becomes dominant, represented by reaction (2). The H2-molecular elimination process, represented by reactions (3) and (4), is not important throughout the temperature range investigated (700 - 2500 K). Concerning the chain-propagation reactions by the H atom (reactions 12 to 15) the reaction of dehydration (15) has a high energy barrier and the possibility\nthat the reaction (15) proceeds is very low. In this group of reactions, reaction (14) represents about 10% of the total reaction rate in the temperature range analyzed by Egolfopoulos et al. (1992). Reactions (12) and (13) remain, however, the most important. In the CH3-radical chain-propagation reactions, reactions (19) and (20) have higher energy barriers and their feasibility can be ruled out kinetically. The other reactions forming methane by H abstraction, reactions (16), (17) and (18), remain important and, at higher temperatures (T > ---1200 K), reaction (18) becomes dominant. These oxidation routes lead ultimately to the production of methane, formaldehyde and other oxygenated hydrocarbons, as depicted in Figure 1, whose kinetics are well treated in the Konnov mechanism. In the proposed detailed kinetic model the most important reactions for the ethanol oxidation were selected and placed, ruling out those reactions whose energy barriers limitations were noted by the different authors. The final proposed detailed kinetic model is composed by 136 chemical species and 1136 elementary reactions. Table 2 shows the major characteristics of the detailed kinetic mechanism used in this work. The sensitivity analysis (dis-\nFigure 5. Comparison between predicted and measured ignition delay times for ethanol/air stoichiometric mixture\nTable 2.

To impove the predictive capability of the kinetic model, the original Arrhenius parameters of this reaction in the Konnov mechanism were altered. The total reaction rate constant for this reaction in the proposed mechanism was formed by the sum of three constants: ka = 1.01 x 10+18 exp(+41351/RT), kb = 4.65 x 10+129T-41-37 and kc = 2.45 x 10+23T-4-97. A similar expression for this rate constant was not found in the literature and this is advanced here as a way of better predicting the measurements for higher pressure and lower temperature.\n4.2.\tResults and comparison to measurements\nFigure 5 shows the comparison between the measured and the predicted ignition delay times. The kinetic model is able to predict the general trends with temperature and pressure, including the smaller dependence with pressure for higher pressures and a smaller dependence with temperature for lower temperatures. At the pressure of 10 bar, the detailed kinetic model over predicts the ignition delay time for higher temperature.\n4.3.\tSensitivity analysis\nA first-order sensitivity analysis of the effect of each reaction on temperature, OH, H2O2, and\nC2H5OH concentrations was performed to find out which reactions dominate the ethanol oxidation at high pressures and also which reaction coefficients need to be systematically improved. For the analysis, we assumed that the combustion process occurs in a perfectly stirred reactor starting at time t = 0 s and ending at t = Ting. The conditions of the reactor were set at stoichiometric composition, pressures of 10, 30, and 50 bar and temperatures of 1100, 950, and 800 K. The sensitivity map was generated from the output files from CHEMKIN and shows the more sensitive reactions for the entire kinetic evolution of the system. The sensitivity map shows that reactions C2H5OH + HO2 # SC2H5O + H2O2 (R1), SC2H5O + O2 CH3CHO + HO2 (R2), C2H5OH + OH\tSC2H5O + H2O (R3) and\nHO2 + HO2 H2O2 + O2 (R4) are the more sensitive reactions at high pressures (10, 30, and 50 bar) and for intermediate and high temperatures (800, 950, and 1100 K). It seems that at high pressures the main ethanol oxidation path is dominated by the H-atom abstraction by the hydroperoxy radical (HO2), producing CH3CHOH (named SC2H5O in this work), one of the three isomers of C2H5O. This route corresponds to reaction R1 above and is represented schematically in the top part of Figure 6. This path leads to the hydrogen peroxide sub-mechanism. In the bottom part of Figure 6, is represented the Hs-abstraction path by collision with a third-body M. This path results also in the production of CH3CHOH which is then oxidized forming acetaldehyde, leading to the acetaldehyde sub-mechanism, and HO2. This corresponds to reaction R2 above. The hydroperoxy radical (HO2) feeds reaction R1 giving more SC2H5O, forming a cycle for the production of SC2H5O and HO2 and depletion of ethanol. R3 becomes relevant when the pool of HO2 is formed. The reaction proceeds and more SC2H5O are produced. With the increase of HO2 concentration, reaction R4 becomes important.\nFigure 6. Main ethanol oxidation route at high pressure\n5.\tConclusions\nIn this paper we proposed a detailed kinetic model for the thermal oxidation of ethanol/air mixtures at higher pressures and intermediate and high temperatures. The model results from a combination and tailoring of the Konnov (2000) and Marinov (1999) models. Initially, the extensively tested kinetic model for small hydrocarbons of Konnov (suitable for hydrocarbons with up to 3 carbon atoms) was extended to include the combustion of ethanol by adding the reactions described by Marinov. Then, in order to further improve the predictive capability of the model, a comprehensive review of the literature was performed and new kinetic data was added from Li et al. (2004), Lin et al. (2002), Lin et al. (2003) and Lin et al. (2004). There data enabled us to update the values of the reaction rate constants of several elementary reactions involving ethanol. Some elementary reactions that appeared neither in Konnov's nor in Marinov's mechanisms were also added. A first-order sensitivity analysis revealed that reaction C2H5OH + HO2\tSC2H5O + H2O2 had the\nlargest sensitivity on temperature, OH, H2O2 and C2II-OII concentrations in the whole temperature interval tested. Then, the rate constants for this reaction were modified in order to better predict the measurements for higher pressure and lower temperatures. The final mechanism is composed of 136 chemical species and contains 1136 elementary reactions. The model was then validated against experimental data of ignition delay time from shock-tube measurements in the pressure range of 10 &lt;p &lt;50 bar and temperature range of 750 &lt;T &lt;1200 K. The detailed kinetic model predicts the reduced pressure sensitivity of the ignition delay time at higher pressures. Additionally, it predicts the global trend with temperature. No negative temperature coefficient region was detected in the temperature and pressure range analyzed. From the detailed kinetic modeling, a possible main oxidation route for ethanol oxidation at high pressures is suggested. This route involves the H-atom abstraction from the secondary carbon of the ethanol molecule by reaction with hydroperoxy radical, giving Cl f.CHOH and H2O2 as major products. It is recommended a more complete comparison of predictions with this reaction mechanism against previous measurements and also a more thorough study of the reactions pointed as the most sensitive, especialy the reaction C2H5OH + HO2 # SC2H5O + H2O2.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientfico e Tecnolgico - CNPq - Brazil, Deutscher Akademis-cher Austausch Dienst - DAAD - Germany, and the German Research Foundation (DFG) for the support given in the development of this work.

Ignition delay times were measured in shock-heated gases for a two-component gasoline surrogate comprised of ethanol and iso-octane at a composition of 25% / 75% by liquid volume, with calculated RON/MON numbers of 109/101. The experiments were carried out in stoichiometric mixtures in synthetic air (oxygen 21% -nitrogen 79%) behind reflected shock waves in a high-pressure shock tube. The temperature ranged between 750 -1200 K, at a pressure of 30 bar. Ignition delay time was determined from CH* chemiluminescence at 431.5 nm measured at a side-wall location. An activation temperature of ~13,272 K was found for the experimental conditions of the shock tube experiments. A detailed chemical kinetics model is proposed for ternary mixtures of gasoline surrogates involving ethanol and primary reference fuels. The kinetics model was obtained by blending the available detailed kinetics models. The qualitative behavior of the ethanol-isooctane mixture investigated in this work was well predicted as well as the behavior of other ignition delay time measurements for pure fuels available in the literature.\nKeywords: Gasoline surrogates, autoignition, shock tube, detailed kinetics model, ethanol.\n1.\tINTRODUCTION\nPresently, the combustion of practical fuels can only be investigated by experimental approaches. However, the scientific community is moving towards more in-depth numerical approaches as computational resources, numerical methods and chemical knowledge increases. As mentioned by Westbrook et al. (2005), computer modeling has grown rapidly to play a major role in virtually every field of science and engineering. Today it is common to find numerical models attempting to represent combustion process of single hydrocarbon fuels, and depending on the desired quality or target of the results, using either global or detailed kinetics mechanisms. In this direction, many researchers have devoted considerable time studding and proposing global and detailed kinetics models. For example, Griffiths (1995) and Simmie (2003) present reviews for oxidation of pure hydrocarbons.\nThe number of chemical species that can be present in a real gasoline can be, however, at the order of hundreds, involving saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons including alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkenes, cycloalkenes, aromatic, ethers and esters, components whose identity and amounts are often unknown (Metcalfe et al. (2007)). The modeling for even a pure component requires reasonable computational resources. The well-known kinetics model for pure isooctane oxidation of Curran et al (2002) is composed by 857 chemical species allowing 3606 elementary reactions. To think about a detailed kinetics model for a practical fuel involving hundreds of chemical species demands a dramatically increase in the number of elementary reactions, making the problem intractable with current computational capabilities.\nBeing mindful of the dimension of the problem the scientific community uses a host of methods to have a reliable approach of the problem. One of these is the modeling the combustion of surrogate mixtures.\nA surrogate fuel consists of a small number of components that can be used to represent the practical fuel and still predict characteristics of the real fuel. These desirable characteristics may include ignition behavior, burning velocity, viscosity, vaporization, and emission such as carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, soot and nitrogen oxides (Metcalfe et al. (2007)). The development and modeling of fuel chemistry of gasoline surrogates started with Curran et al. (1998) and Curran et al. (2002). They reported detailed chemical kinetics models of n-heptane and iso-octane covering the parameters used to qualified fuel ignition the Research Octane Number (RON) and the Motor Octane Number (MON). The RON and MON scales are both based on Primary Reference Fuels (PRF); n-heptane (RON = MON = 0) and iso\noctane (RON = MON = 100). Here, the use of surrogate fuels is an approach to make the development of chemical kinetics mechanisms for practical fuels tractable. These kinetics models have been compared to, ignition delay time measurements and other quantities.\nSeveral experimental results of ignition delay time in shock tube have been reported involving PRFs and ethanol. Davidson et al. (2002) reported shock-tube measurements of iso-octane/O2 mixtures in a temperature range of 1177 to 2009 K, a pressure range of 1.18 to 8.17 bar and equivalence ratios form 0.25 to 2. Hydroxyl radical concentration time histories were reported. Gauthier et al. (2004) reported ignition delay times for n-heptane/air at pressures between 15 -60 bar, temperatures of 800 - 1350 K and stoichiometric mixture composition. Natarajan and Bhaskaran (1981) reported ignition delay time measurements in a shock tube of mixtures of ethanol/O2, for pressures of 1.0 and 2.0 bar at higher temperatures of 1300 - 1700 K and equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0. Dunphy and Simmie (1991) reported ignition delay times of ethanol/O2 mixtures at high temperatures (1080 - 1660 K), pressures between 1.8 - 4.6 bar and equivalence ratios between 0.25 - 2.0. Cancino et al. (2009) reports measurements of ignition delay times measured in a high-pressure shock tube for a temperature range of 690 - 1200 K at pressures of 10, 30 and 50 bar for stoichiometric composition of ethanol/air mixtures. More information about experimental results involving ethanol in different experimental results can be found in Cancino et al. (2008).\nConcerning numerical studies of binary gasoline surrogate mixtures involving PRFs, Curran et al. (1998) proposed the first detailed kinetics model for n-heptane and iso-octane blends at elevated pressures. This kinetics model was validated against experimental results in a high-pressure flow reactor using both the pure components and their mixtures in a temperature range of 550 - 850 K and at pressures of 12.5 bar. The Curran et al. (1998) PRF model was validated against measured ignition delay times in shock tubes over the temperature range of 690 - 1220 K and at pressure of 40 bar, Good agreement was observed between experimental and simulation results for both pure PRF and their mixtures. Concerning ethanol oxidation, Marinov (1999) proposed the often cited detailed kinetics model for high-temperature ethanol oxidation validated against experimental results of ignition delay time in shock tube from Dunphy and Simmie (1991) and Dunphy et al. (1991) for temperatures between 1300 - 1700 K, a pressure range of 1 - 3.4 bar and equivalence ratios between 0.5 - 2.0. Afterwards, Cancino et al. (2009) upgraded Marinov\u2019s ethanol kinetics and proposed a detailed kinetics model for ethanol oxidation in air, at pressures of 10, 30 and 50 bar, and intermediate temperatures of 690 - 1200 K in stoichiometric mixtures.\nIn this work we propose a detailed kinetics model for ternary mixtures of gasoline surrogates involving PRFs and ethanol. Simultaneously, we report experimental data of ignition delay time of the binary mixture ethanol/iso-octane (25%/75% by volume) at pressure of 30 bar and temperatures between 800 - 1217 K for stoichiometric composition. Figure 1 shows the molecular structure of the three fuels ethanol, iso-octane and n-heptane molecules considered in the detailed kinetics model proposed here.\nEthanol 2,2,4-trimethyl-pentane\tn-heptane\n(iso-octane)\nFigure 1. Molecular structure of fuels considered in this work\nThe proposed gasoline surrogate model is composed by ethanol (oxygenate hydrocarbon), iso-octane (saturated isoparaffin), n-heptane (saturated n-paraffin).\n2.\tEXPERIMENTS\nThe experiments were carried out in the high-pressure shock tube at the University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany. This facility, depicted in Figure 2, has an internal diameter of 90 mm, divided by an aluminum diaphragm into a driver section of 6.1 m and a driven section of 6.4 m in length. The driven section is pumped down to pressures below 10-2 mbar in between the experiments. Gas mixtures were prepared by injecting liquid ethanol - iso-octane (25%/75%) mixture into a stainless-steel mixing vessel and subsequent complete evaporation and mixing. The total amount of fuel mixture and air was controlled manometrically in order to ensure the desired equivalence ratio. The shock speed was measured over two intervals using three piezo-electric pressure gauges.\nPressure data were recorded with a time resolution of 0.1 ps. The temperature and pressure behind the reflected shock wave were computed from the measured incident shock speed and the speed attenuation using a one-dimensional shock-tube model (shock-tube code of the CHEMKIN package Kee et al. (2000)). The estimated uncertainty in reflected shock temperature is less than \u00b125 K. The experiments were carried out with synthetic air containing 79.5% N2 and 20.5% O2. The ignition was observed by measuring pressure profiles with a piezo-electric gauge (PCB HM 112 A03) located 15 mm upstream of the end flange. Also, the CH* emission at 431.5 nm was selected by a narrow band\npass filter (5 nm HWHM) and detected with a photomultiplier. All ignition delay times shown in this work were determined by extrapolating the steepest increase of the CH* chemiluminescence emission signal to its zero level on the time axis as shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2. Experimental setup of the high-pressure shock tube facility\nThe driver gas was mixed in-situ by using two high-pressure mass-flow controllers (Bronkhorst Hi-Tec flow meter F-136AI-FZD-55-V and F-123MI-FZD-55-V). Helium was used as the main component and Argon was added to match the acoustic impedance of the test gas. The required driver gas composition was calculated by a spreadsheet analysis prior to the experiments using equations by Oertel (1966) and Palmer and Knox (1961). Concentrations of 5 to 20% Ar in He were required to generate tailored shock waves.\n2.1.\tMeasured ignition delay times\nThe ignition delay times evaluated from the CH* emission, are listed in Table 1 along with the respective temperatures T and pressures p, for stoichiometric ethanol - iso-octane (25%/75%) / air mixture. At temperatures lower than those shown in Table 1 no ignition was observed within the test time of our experiment (15 ms).\nTable 1.

Ignition delay time for mixture ethanol/isooctane (25%/75% by liquid volume) / air.\n3.\tDETAILED KINETICS MODELING\n3.1.\tBlending process\nThe strategy to tailor the detailed kinetics model requires a sequence of steps that are outlined here:\n1.\tAnalyze and potentially adjust the kinetics information of both mechanisms for their use in CHEMKIN.\n2.\tCheck the species names in both mechanisms and remove duplicate reactions from the second (minor) mechanism.\n3.\tAdd the missing reactions into the main mechanism.\n4.\tCheck the thermodynamic data base of the major mechanism and upgrade it with data for the missing species.\n5.\tTest the blended kinetics model with the CHEMKIN interpreter and validate it against measured ignition delay times to make sure that the added reactions for an additional fuel component does not change the behavior of the mechanism in case this component is not present.\n6.\tOptimize the blended kinetics mechanism: Determine the rate-determining route for autoignition via a sensitivity analysis and figure out whether the major reactions have reliable (directly measured) kinetics data.\nThe blending procedure is time consuming. When two chemical species have the same empirical formula, it is necessary to check their thermodynamic databases by comparing the enthalpy h, heat capacity cp, and entropy v at several temperatures. If their thermodynamic properties return the same (or similar) values, then both chemical species are identical despite different names or abbreviations used in the original kinetics models. Productivity increases with the use of computational tools. The programs of Rolland and Simmie (2004) were used to compare the kinetics mechanisms and thermodynamic databases.\n3.2.\tProposed detailed kinetics model for ethanol-PRF blends\nA detailed kinetics model for ternary gasoline surrogates involving ethanol, iso-octane and n-heptane is proposed here. The chemical species were selected based on the availability of detailed chemistry in the literature. The starting point was the PRF model of Curran et al. (1998). The chemical kinetics of ethanol oxidation was taken from Cancino et al (2009), which is an upgraded chemistry of ethanol based on Marinov (1999) and Konnov (2000) kinetics mechanisms. Table 2 shows the origin of the sub-mechanisms.\nTable 2.

Experimental results from Cancino et al (2009) and numerical predictions of both, the Curran PRF model and of the blended proposed model in this work.\nThe Curran PRF model was developed specifically for iso-octane and n-heptane fuels and it was expected that the PRF model would fail in the predictions of ignition delay times for ethanol-air mixtures, especially at temperatures below 1000 K. However, the PRF model is sensitive to the pressure dependence of the ignition delay time, as observed in experiments. After adding the ethanol chemistry from recent studies from Cancino et al. (2009) the resulting kinetics model is able to reproduce ignition delay times for ethanol-air mixtures.\n4.2.\tResults for pure iso-octane\nFigure 5 shows the numerical predictions of both, the Curran PRF model and the proposed detailed kinetics model for iso-octane / air mixtures at pressures of 16.8 and 49.4 bar, temperatures between 950 - 1200 K and stoichiometric composition. The experimental data was obtained from Davidson et al. (2005).\nFigure 5. Experimental results from Davidson et al (2005) and numerical predictions of both, the Curran PRF model and of the blended proposed model in this work.\nFigure 5 shows that the Curran PRF model overestimates the experimental results, and the discrepancy is more evident at pressures of 16.8 bar. The proposed model slightly underestimates the experimental results at higher temperatures. However, the proposed model captures the general trends of the experiments.\n4.3.\tResults for the gasoline surrogate ethanol / iso-octane (25% / 75%)\nFigure 6 shows the numerical and experimental results for the binary mixture investigated in this study.\nFigure 6. Numerical and experimental results of ignition delay time for ethanol - iso-octane (25%/75%) in air.\nThe PRF model overestimates the values of ignition delay time in the temperature range of this study. Adding the upgraded ethanol chemistry, the performance of the resulting detailed kinetics model improves. The proposed model underestimates the values of ignition delay time for temperatures about ~1050 K. However, the model captures the general trends of the experiments.\n5.\tCONCLUSIONS\nIgnition delay times were measured in a shock tube for a binary mixture comprised of ethanol and iso-octane at a composition of 25% / 75% by liquid volume, with calculated RON/MON numbers of 109/101. The experiments were carried out for stoichiometric mixtures in air behind reflected shock waves in a high-pressure shock tube. Initial reflected shock conditions were varied with the temperature range of 750 - 1200 K at a pressure of 30 bar. An activation temperature obtained by data post-processing of experimental results was found to be ~13,273 K for the investigated conditions at stoichiometric mixture composition. A detailed kinetics model is proposed and validated against our experimental results, and against experimental results of ignition delay times in shock tube for the pure fuels available at literature. The numerical results of ignition delay time of the proposed kinetics model shows good agreement to the experimental data of ethanol and iso-octane available in the literature.\nFor iso-octane/air mixtures, the Curran PRF model overestimates the experimental results, and the discrepancy is more evident at pressures of 16.8 bar. The proposed model underestimates the experimental results. However, the proposed model captures the general trend of the experiments.\nFor the binary mixture analyzed in this work, the PRF model overestimates the values of ignition delay time in the temperature range of this study. Adding the upgraded ethanol chemistry, the performance of the resulting detailed kinetics model improves. The proposed model underestimates the values of ignition delay time for temperatures about ~1050 K.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico - CNPq - Brazil, Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst - DAAD - Germany, and the German Research Foundation (DFG) for the support given in the development of this work.
