Tendo em conta a morfologia de derivados de filmes comp\u00f3sitos e \ndiferentes modelos termodin\u00e2micos de superficie, sugere-se que um filme \ncomp\u00f3sito com uma textura mais porosa poder\u00e1 levar a um efeito de super-\nhidrofilicidade superior.

Results \nobtained so far have shown that sol-gel formulations yielding less reactive sols \nlead to enhanced super-hydrophilicity persistence of composite films, i.e. a \nwater contact angle less than 10\n\no\n after aging for more than 8 weeks (aging \n\nunder ambient conditions without UV radiation). Taking into account the \nmorphology of derived composite films and different surface thermodynamics \nmodels, we have suggested that a more rough/porous structure of the \ncomposite film might even increase this enhanced hydrophilicity effect. To \nverify this hypothesis, we have chosen to study more reactive TiO2-SiO2 \ncomposite sols with different compositions (0, 20, 60 and 100mol% of SiO2). \nThis greater sol-gel reactivity is expected to reduce the natural super-\nhydrophilicity of composite films in order to better assess eventual effects of the \nmorphology. Then, in order to artificially create rough/porous morphologies, we \nhave used polystyrene (PS) beads with average diameter of 0.6?m. \n \nDifferent parameters of spin-coating deposition method were tested to define \nthe best conditions to obtain 2D layers of closely packed PS beads. Further, \ntwo experiments with different rotation speeds (1000rpm and 500rpm) were \nperformed. Other spin-coating conditions were fixed as follows: acceleration of \n5000rpm/s, rotation time of 1s, concentration of PS beads 1wt% in EtOH, \nvolume of PS solution 100?L. Such 2D PS layers were then impregnated with \nTiO2-SiO2 composite sols. Using PS beads, we have obtained TiO2-SiO2 \ncomposite films with a roughness that is almost 100 times higher than \ncomposite films without PS beads. These morphology features are confirmed \nby optical microscopy, AFM and FEG-SEM measurements. Water contact \nangle measurements show in turn that the hydrophilicity effects are increased \nby morphologic modifications, and in the best cases (samples with 20-60mol% \nof SiO2) water contact angles are close to 5\n\no \nafter 6 weeks of aging under \n\nambient conditions without UV radiation. This study also shows that, in these \ncases, there is some relation between: 1) the surface coverage of PS beads, 2) \nthe surface roughness/porosity of S1-X+PS films, and 3) their super-\nhydrophilicity persistence. \n \n\n\n\n \n\nList of Figures and Tables \nFig. 1: Illustration of the photo-induced super-hydrophilicity of a TiO2 coating .................. 3 \n\nFig. 2: Kinetics of evolution of the water contact angle on three different ........................... 4 \n\nFig. 3: Water contact angle measured after eight weeks of aging ......................................... 5 \n\nFig. 4: FEG-SEM and AFM images of the optimized composite film ................................. 6 \n\nFig. 5: Critical flow to detach oil drop as a function of water contact angle ........................ 7 \n\nFig. 6: SEM micrograph and TEM image of macro-meso-microporous structure of SiO2 \n\nobtained with template of polystyrene latex spheres ............................................................. 8 \n\nFig. 7: Schematic representation of the macro-pores formation ........................................... 8 \n\nFig. 8: Schematic representation of two PS spheres partially immersed in a liquid layer \n\nconvective flux toward the ordered phase ............................................................................. 9 \n\nFig. 9: Schematic representation of spin-coating method ................................................... 10 \n\nFig. 10: Schematics of contact angle ? formed between a liquid drop and a solid surface . 13 \n\nFig. 11: Schematics of water contact angle ? formed between liquid drop and solid surface \n\nas a function of its hydrophobic/hydrophilic characteristics ............................................... 13 \n\nFig. 12: Schematics of water contact angle formed between a liquid drop and a surface \n\nwith an open porosity .......................................................................................................... 14 \n\nFig. 13: Schema of the device for water contact angle measurements ................................ 15 \n\nFig. 14: Formation of thin films via sol-gel approach ......................................................... 16 \n\nFig. 15: Optical and FEG-SEM images representing the influence of solvent by using a \n\nstandard deposition protocol ................................................................................................ 21 \n\nFig. 16: Optical images and graphics represent results of different rotation speeds and \n\nrotation times ....................................................................................................................... 22 \n\nFig. 17: Optical images representing the influence of the surface coverage when different \n\naccelerations are applied ...................................................................................................... 23 \n\nFig. 18: Reproducibility of the samples represented by optical and FEG-SEM images ..... 24 \n\nFig. 19: Influence of the duration of the ultrasound (US) and magnetic agitation (MA) \n\nrepresented by optical images and graphics ........................................................................ 25 \n\nFig. 20: Optical and FEG-SEM images representing the influence of a rotation speed of \n\n500rpm and 1000rpm tested on different surfaces .............................................................. 26 \n\nFig. 21: Influence of the PS solution concentration represented by optical and FEG-SEM \n\nimages .................................................................................................................................. 28 \n\n\n\n \n\nFig. 22: Influence of the deposited volume of the solution (on Si substrate) observed in \n\nmicroscopic scale with OM and comparison of two samples in macroscopic scale ........... 29 \n\nFig. 23: Optical images characterizing samples before and after impregnation with \n\nhydrophilic TiO2-SiO2 composite S1-60.

Introduction \n\nThe concept of \u201cself-cleaning surfaces\u201d has been a subject of particular interest for the past \n\ndecades and the research field in this direction has increased significantly. Photo-induced \n\nproperties of titanium dioxide (TiO2) coatings, when exposed to UV radiation, allow \n\ndevelopment of the studies. However, Manuel Houmard in his PhD thesis work in \n\nLaboratoire des Mat\u00e9riaux et de G\u00e9nie Physique (LMGP) of Grenoble INP has shown that, \n\ncontrary to TiO2 coatings that need to be exposed to UV radiation, TiO2-SiO2 nano-\n\ncomposite coatings obtained by sol-gel method show a natural super-hydrophilicity of the \n\nsurface. This property allows natural and efficient elimination of pollution (oils or others) \n\npresent on the surface just by simple washing with water without need of different \n\ndetergents or exposure to UV radiation. \n\nAlthough the \u201cself-cleaning\u201d functionality of TiO2-SiO2 nano-composite coatings obtained \n\nby sol-gel method has already been shown and proven at LMGP, the origin of this super-\n\nhydrophilicity effect still raises questions, particularly about the nature of the nano-\n\ncomposite. Answers to these questions would make not only a progress in knowledge \n\nabout the fundamental mechanisms responsible about this property, but also provide \n\npossibilities for further optimization of the functionality. This Master thesis work is a part \n\nof that goal. \n\n  \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\n2. Theoretical description and generalities \n\n2.1. Super-hydrophilicity: photo-induced property \n\nIn order to consider a material as hydrophilic, it should exhibit a strong surface energy and \n\nhave the possibility to create hydrogen bonds with water. This hydrophilic property is \n\ndescribed by a water contact angle value that is lower than 90\no \n\nin contact with the surface \n\nof the material. First researches on photo-induced properties of titanium dioxide (TiO2) \n\ndate from 1970, when the work of Fujishima et al. showed that a TiO2 electrode, when \n\nirradiated with UV, could decompose the water into hydrogen and oxygen [1]. Such photo-\n\ninduced reaction results from the fact that TiO2 is a semiconductor with different energies \n\nfor the valance band (VB) and conduction band (CB), creating an energy gap between both \n\nlevels. Thus, when TiO2 absorbs a photon with energy that is higher or equal to that of the \n\nband gap, an electron-hole pair is generated, where the electron (hole) is excited from the \n\nVB (CB) to the CB (VB) [2]. The charge carriers are therefore generated in the form of \n\nphoto-electrons (e\n-\n) and photo-holes (h\n\n+\n) by the following reaction: \n\nTiO2 + h? ? e\n-\n + h\n\n+\n      (1) \n\nThese photo-generated charges are responsible for the high photo-catalytic activity of TiO2 \n\nbecause the formation of highly reactive species, such as hydroxyl radicals (OH\u2022), leads to \n\nthe degradation of the pollution adsorbed on the surface via red-ox reactions. \n\nAnother interesting property of TiO2 is its photo-induced super-hydrophilicity. Wong et al. \n\nhave shown that the increased super-hydrophilicity of TiO2 is not uniform but involves \n\nlocalized domains that are favorable to the water adsorption [3,4]. Photo-generated \n\nelectrons tend to reduce the cations Ti\n4+\n\n in Ti\n3+\n\n (equation (2)), meanwhile the holes are \n\ntrapped in the oxygen network within the TiO2 matrix (equation (3)). This insertion of \n\nholes weakens the linking between the oxygen atoms and associated titanium atoms, thus \n\nfavoring the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of TiO2 (equation (4)) [5,6]: \n\ne\n-\n + Ti\n\n4+\n ? Ti\n\n3+\n (electron trapping)      (2) \n\nh\n+\n + O\n\n2-\n ? O\n\n-\n (hole trapping)       (3) \n\nh\n+\n + O\n\n-\n ? \u00bd O2 + O\u2022 (formation of oxygen vacancy)   (4) \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nThe oxygen vacancies are then able to promote a molecular or dissociative adsorption of \n\nthe atmospheric water, producing surface OH groups. Thus, the functionalized surface has \n\na great affinity for the water that gives its super-hydrophilic properties, determined by a \n\nwater contact angle close to zero (see Fig. 1). It has also been shown that other parameters \n\nsuch as roughness and ambient atmosphere might influence the photo-induced super-\n\nhydrophilicity of the material [7,8]. \n\n \n\nThese photo-induced properties are the objects of mainly extensive studies for self-\n\ncleaning applications in outdoor atmosphere, i.e. atmosphere which takes advantage of \n\nsolar UV light and rain water to remove carbon pollution. \n\n2.2. New alternatives \n\nPrevious studies have shown that the addition of SiO2 into the TiO2 film decreases the \n\nwater contact angle and this effect might last for several days [9]. In his PhD thesis held in \n\nLMGP, M. Houmard has improved this tendency by studying sol-gel thin films of TiO2-\n\nSiO2 nano-composites [10]. These layers show a natural super-hydrophilicity and this \n\nproperty can persist for several weeks or months in the absence of UV light. This natural \n\nsuper-hydrophilicity allows new developments of \u201cself-cleaning\u201d surfaces entirely based \n\non natural super-hydrophilic properties in atmosphere where UV light cannot be present \n\npermanently or in strong dose, i.e. indoor atmosphere. \n\n2.3. Mechanisms of super-hydrophilicity of TiO2-SiO2 nano-\n\ncomposites with granular interfaces \n\nBy following the evolving kinetics of water contact angle on the film surface over aging \n\nwithout UV radiation, M. Houmard has shown the beneficial effect of TiO2-SiO2 granular \n\n \n\nFig. 1: Illustration of the photo-induced super-hydrophilicity of a TiO2 coating [6] \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\ninterfaces on the natural super-hydrophilicity of derived composite films. As seen in Fig. 2, \n\nthe reference films of pure TiO2 and pure SiO2 have a super-hydrophilic effect only for the \n\nfirst few hours or days, which disappears rapidly without UV radiation. Meanwhile, the \n\ncomposite conserves its super-hydrophilicity for a very long time, i.e. a water contact angle \n\nsmaller than 5\no \n\nafter eight weeks of aging [10]. \n\n \n\nAlthough, the morphology of composite films is a factor that might influence their super-\n\nhydrophilicity, another hypothesis would be the formation of deprotonated TiOx\n-\n and/or \n\nprotonated SiOx\n+\n units at the TiO2-SiO2 granular interfaces of composite films. These \n\ninterfacial charges have been frequently mentioned as the main reason for the catalytic \n\nbehavior of TiO2-SiO2 composites [10]. In our case, charges that appear on the surface of \n\ncomposite films can induce the molecular or dissociative adsorption of the atmospheric \n\nwater resulting in the super-hydrophilicity. Thus, the water contact angle for the TiO2-SiO2 \n\ncomposite material is never between those of pure TiO2 and pure SiO2 as one would \n\nexpect. Fig. 3 represents the water contact angle measured after eight weeks of aging under \n\nambient atmosphere without UV irradiation as a function of the sol TiO2-SiO2 molar \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n\nA\nn\n\ng\nle\n\n d\ne\n\n c\no\n\nn\nta\n\nc\nt \n\n(\u00b0\n)\n\n Temps de vieillissement (jour)\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\n \n\nFig. 2: Kinetics of evolution of the water contact angle on three different surfaces as a \n\nfunction of aging in the ambient atmosphere and without UV irradiation: (a) pure TiO2, \n\n(b) pure SiO2 and (c) a TiO2-SiO2 composite film deposited from a sol with SiO2 \n\nconcentration of 60mol% [10] \n\nW\na\nte\n\nr\n c\n\no\nn\n\nta\nc\nt \n\na\nn\n\ng\nle\n\n, \n?\n\n (\no\n) \n\nAging time (days) \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\ncomposition. These results show that the best persistence of the super-hydrophilicity is \n\nobserved for those composites that have more TiO2-SiO2 interfaces with an optimum \n\ncomposition containing 40-60mol% of SiO2. This observation reinforces the assumption \n\nthat the natural super-hydrophilicity arises, at least partially, from interfaces effects. As \n\nwill be detailed in next section the sol-gel reactivity is another factor that can influence \n\ninterfaces effects. \n\n \n\nAs it was mentioned before, morphology of the composite films can also strongly influence \n\ntheir natural super-hydrophilic behavior. Indeed, it is known that a naturally hydrophilic \n\nsurface becomes even more hydrophilic when being porous or rough (see section 3.5.1). \n\nPrevious studies have revealed the porosity and roughness of TiO2-SiO2 composite films, \n\nwhere composite films with best super-hydrophilicity persistence have an RMS roughness \n\nof about 10 nm, compared to 5 nm and less than 1 nm for pure TiO2 and SiO2 films, \n\nrespectively. The optimized composite films also exhibit a porous sponge-like morphology \n\nthat is characterized by big surface cavities (see dark areas in FEG-SEM and AFM images \n\nof Fig. 4). Thus, it remains important to assess how the effects of granular interfaces and \n\nmorphology respectively influence the natural super-hydrophilicity of TiO2-SiO2 \n\ncomposites. This Master thesis work is a contribution to this objective. \n\n \n\nFig. 3: Water contact angle measured after eight weeks of aging under ambient \n\natmosphere without UV irradiation as a function of the SiO2 sol molar composition [10] \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120W\na\nte\n\nr\n c\n\no\nn\n\nta\nc\nt \n\na\nn\n\ng\nle\n\n a\nft\n\ne\nr\n 8\n\n w\ne\ne\nk\n\ns \n(\u00b0\n\n) \n\nSi/(Si+Ti) in the solution (mol%) \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4. Cleanability \n\nIn last decades, many studies have been devoted to the detachment of an oil drop deposited \n\non a surface by using skimming flow [11,12]. Inspired by these works, SIMaP laboratory \n\nof Grenoble INP has developed an experimental setup for dynamic wetting tests, which \n\nuses skimming flow of water to simulate the cleaning of a surface previously polluted with \n\noil [13,14]. This device implements a cell with laminar flow that is associated with an \n\noptical device that follows the evolution of the oil drop in real time when increasing the \n\nwater flow. The minimal critical flow that is needed to completely detach the oil drop \n\nprovides quantitative information on the water cleanability of the surface. \n\nThese flow measurements were performed to detach an oil drop from the surfaces of \n\nvarious TiO2-SiO2 compositions aged under ambient atmosphere during 8 weeks without \n\nUV light. Results illustrated in Fig. 5 demonstrate a perfect correlation between enhanced \n\nsuper-hydrophilicity persistence, as shown in Fig. 3, and a reduced critical flow of water, \n\nproving that the cleanability of the composite surfaces directly arises from their super-\n\nhydrophilicity. \n\n \n\nFig. 4: FEG-SEM (left) and AFM (right) images of the optimized composite film [10] \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.5. Artificial porosity/roughness \n\nSince an enhanced roughness or surface porosity of TiO2-SiO2 composite films can favor \n\ntheir natural super-hydrophilicity, the aim of this Master thesis work has been to artificially \n\nincrease the porous/rough structure of TiO2-SiO2 composites in order to assess how this \n\nmodification influences the water wettability. It is known that the use of differently sized \n\nporogenes (macro- and meso-sized) results in aligned and closely packed pores leading to \n\nstructures of controlled porosity, pore size, and surface area [15]. For instance, previous \n\nstudies have shown that one can obtain architectured macro-meso-microporous structures \n\nwith 3D interconnectivity by using polystyrene (PS) latex spheres, copolymers such as \n\nPluronic F127 or P123, and alcohol as co-surfactant (see Fig. 6) [16]. \n\n \n\nFig. 5: Critical flow to detach oil drop as a function of water contact angle measured on \n\nvarious composite coatings after 8 weeks of aging [10] \n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n\nC\nr\nit\n\nic\na\n\nl \nfl\n\no\nw\n\n f\no\n\nr\n o\n\nil\n d\n\nr\no\n\np\n d\n\ne\nta\n\nc\nh\n\ne\nm\n\ne\nn\n\nt \n(L\n\n/h\n) \n\nWater contact angle  after 8 weeks (\u00b0) \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn this work, we have used such results to artificially form macro-porous structures (a \n\ntypical pore dimension of some hundreds of nanometers) from PS beads. According to the \n\nliterature and as illustrated in Fig. 7, this approach relies on the preliminary formation of a \n\ncomposite monolith constituted of PS beads and an inorganic network, for instance SiO2 in \n\nthe example illustrated in Fig. 6.  PS beads are subsequently eliminated through solvent \n\nextraction or calcination, which yields a residual inorganic rough and porous network. \n\n \n\nIn the recent literature, the artificial formation of porous inorganic networks has generally \n\nbeen devoted to 3D structures [15,16]. In contrast, we have chosen to focus the present \n\nwork on the 2D assembly (single-layer) of closely-packed PS nano-beads that would be \n\n \n(a)   (b)    (c) \n\nFig. 7: Schematic representation of the macro-pores formation: (a) composite monolith \n\nconstituted of PS beads, (b) when inorganic SiO2 solution diffuses into the interstitial \n\nvoids of PS monolith, it precipitates around the PS beads, and (c) removing the PS beads \n\nyields a macro-porous inorganic network, adapted from [16] \n\n \n\nFig. 6: SEM micrograph (left) and TEM image (right) of macro-meso-microporous \n\nstructure of SiO2 obtained with template of polystyrene latex spheres with average \n\ndiameter size of 485nm, Pluronic F127 as surfactant, n-pentanol as co-surfactant; \n\nreprinted from [16] \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nused as a template to create a rough and macro-porous structure from TiO2-SiO2 \n\ncomposites. In order to reach this goal, one has first to study the elaboration of closely-\n\npacked PS single-layers by a spin-coating technique, which can subsequently be \n\nimpregnated with a composite sol. \n\n2.6. 2D assembly of PS beads by spin-coating method \n\n2.6.1. 2D assembly of PS beads \n\nThe very first descriptions about the basic formation mechanisms of 2D ordered clusters \n\nfrom colloidal particles on a substrate were proposed in 1909 by J. Perrin [17]. Based on \n\nthis work, Denkov et al. more recently re-described the 2D ordering of micrometer-size \n\npolystyrene latex spheres on a horizontal glass substrate by means of optical microscopy \n\nobservations [18]. They have proven that the main factors governing the ordering are: 1) \n\nthe attractive capillary forces caused by the liquid (generally water) menisci formed around \n\nthe particles and 2) the convective transport in liquid medium of particles toward the \n\nordered region (see Fig. 8a). Further, the formation of well-ordered single-layers or well-\n\nordered domains consisting of multilayers (bi-layers, tri-layers, etc.) can be controlled by \n\nthe water evaporation rate (see Fig. 8b). \n\n \n\nAt the first stage, a \u201cnucleus\u201d of ordered phase appears when the upper surface of the \n\nthinning aqueous layer in the wetting film presses the latex particles toward the water-glass \n\ninterface. The ordering of PS spheres starts when the thickness of the water layer \n\ncontaining PS particles becomes approximately equal to the diameter of particles. From \n\n  \n\nFig. 8: Schematic representation of (a) two PS spheres partially immersed in a liquid \n\nlayer on a horizontal solid substrate showing that the deformation of the liquid meniscus \n\ngives rise to inter-particle attraction; and (b) convective flux toward the ordered phase \n\ndue to the water evaporation from the menisci between the particles in the 2D array; \n\nreprinted from [18] \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nhere, one can define the second stage of the 2D crystal growth when the horizontal \n\ncomponent of capillary forces (i.e. convective water flux) causes the directional motion of \n\nparticles toward the ordered array and the evaporation of water leads to a gradual decrease \n\nof the liquid layer thickness with time. That increases the curvature and hence the local \n\nsucking capillary pressure causing an intensive water influx from the thicker parts of the \n\nliquid layer where the pressure is higher [18]. \n\nThe described mechanisms suggest at least two ways to control the ordering process: 1) \n\ncontrol of the speed of the convective flow by changing the rate of water evaporation and \n\n2) control of the profile of the liquid meniscus encircling the ordered array by ejecting \n\n(injecting) some amount of suspension during the experiment. In both cases the \n\nmechanisms lead to a change of the liquid layer thickness and a surface slope at the \n\nboundary between the array and the encircling meniscus. Nevertheless, large mono-crystal \n\ndomains (better quality of 2D arrays) can be obtained when the rate of 2D crystal growth is \n\nlower [18]. \n\n2.6.2. Spin-coating method \n\nIn this work, we have studied the liquid deposition of 2D PS structures using a spin-coating \n\nmethod (see Fig. 9). The general description of this method relies on four steps: 1) \n\ndeposition of the material where the deposited liquid solution wets the substrate; 2) radial \n\nacceleration where the centrifugal force generated by the rotation of the substrate pushes \n\nthe liquid towards the edges of the substrate and covers it fully; 3) constant rotation where \n\nthe liquid film homogenizes and the extra amount of liquid is ejected from the substrate \n\ndue to the centrifugal force; and 4) solidification where the evaporation of the solvent \n\n(which might occur already during the steps 2 and 3) yields a film constituted of solid \n\nparticles initially diluted in the liquid or activates organic or inorganic (sol-gel, see after) \n\npolymerization reactions leading to solid thin film formation [10]. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 9: Schematic representation of spin-coating method \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nOne has to take into account that the layer formation from colloidal solution with polymer \n\nbeads (or other kinds of solid particles diluted in a liquid) by spin-coating method is not the \n\nsame as in the case of polymeric solutions. Thus, in our case, the basic mechanisms of thin \n\nfilm formation from polymeric solutions cannot be applied completely. Actually, only few \n\nresearch papers have described the use of spin-coating technique in order to obtain 2D \n\nassembly of PS nano-spheres [19-21]. According to these papers, in the case of colloidal \n\nsuspensions, there are two types of parameters that have to be considered and to be \n\nadjusted during deposition process. One has to estimate, a) the parameters of the colloidal \n\nsuspension: such as the diameter of PS beads, concentration, surfactants on the surface of \n\nnano-spheres, solvents etc., and b) the parameters for the spin-coating method: rotation \n\nspeed, rotation duration, acceleration, deposited volume of suspension etc. This huge range \n\nof experimental parameters does not allow to a-priori fix one possible approach to obtain \n\nbest 2D PS assemblies. For instance, some recent papers have shown that variation of the \n\nparameters involved in the spin-coating deposition of PS micro-beads yield a wide range of \n\nresults in terms of 2D-assembly performances [20,21]. Thus, a first goal of this work has \n\nbeen to find the assembly conditions in relation to our final objective. Let us recall that the \n\n2D PS assembly intended here corresponds to a preliminary step, which will be followed \n\nby the impregnation of composite sols in order to finally create an artificially enhanced \n\nroughness or porosity of TiO2-SiO2 composite films. For this subsequent composite sols \n\nimpregnation, we have directly extrapolated spin-coating deposition conditions habitually \n\nused for the formation of composite films. These conditions will be recalled in following \n\nsections. In this work, silica wafers were used as substrates. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\n3. Characterization methods \n\nAll the physicochemical and morphological characterization methods described in this \n\nwork have been done in LMGP and SIMaP laboratories of Grenoble INP. \n\n3.1. Optical Microscopy (OM) \n\nOptical microscopy, employed to obtain an enlarged image of a small object, uses visible \n\nlight and modifies the path of the light to generate an improved contrast image from a \n\nsample. For analysis of surface structures, one can use transmitted or reflected light \n\nconfigurations. In our case, as the substrate used for the sample preparation is Si (non-\n\ntransparent), the sample illumination is done from the top of the sample (reflected light \n\ndetection). Observations with optical microscope allow obtaining a general description of \n\nthe sample surface to anticipate further experiments. \n\n3.2. Coverage Rate (CR) \n\nSurface coverage rate quantitatively describes the rate of the polystyrene beads covering \n\nthe substrate and permits quantitative analysis of obtained samples. In order to calculate \n\nCR, a program called \u2018ImageJ\u2019 is used. This program uses optical images and, applying a \n\nthreshold function, compares \u2018white areas\u2019 with \u2018black areas\u2019 observed in the pictures. \n\n3.3. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) \n\nScanning electron microscopy technique is based on the principle of the electron-medium \n\ninteractions. Electron beam scans the surface of the sample reemitting different radiation \n\n(secondary electrons, backscattered electrons, Auger electrons, X-rays).  Different \n\ndetectors allow analyzing the reemitted radiations, reconstruct the image of the surface and \n\ndetermine chemical elements present in the zone of analysis. Morphological and micro-\n\nstructural characterization of TiO2-SiO2 composite thin films was done using a pressure \n\ncontrolled FEG (Field Emission Gun) SEM microscope. \n\n3.4. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) \n\nAtomic force microscopy (AFM) permits to study the sample surface topography. The \n\nprinciple of this technique is based on the interactions between the sample and a tip \n\nattached on a micro-lever. The tip scans the surface of the sample and, according to \n\nfeedback parameters, changes its height. Computer registers the height and reconstructs an \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nimage of the surface. Roughness of the surface is characterized by the RMS (Root Mean \n\nSquare) value. AFM measurements are recorded in \u2018tapping\u2019 mode using a silicon nitride \n\ntip with a curvature radius of around 15nm. \n\n3.5. Wetting \u2013 water contact angle measurements \n\n3.5.1. Theory \n\nThe wettability measurements are widely employed techniques in studies of surface \n\nproperties and are usually used to characterize the affinity between a solid and a liquid by \n\nmeasuring the liquid contact angle ? formed between the liquid and solid surface as shown \n\nin Fig. 10. \n\n \n\nIn this work, the water contact angles were measured using the sessile drop method. When \n\nthe drop is deposited on the solid surface, it acquires particular configuration that describes \n\ninteractions occurring at the solid/liquid interface (see Fig. 11). \n\n \n\nAs it was described in paragraph 2, creation of a rough surface is the aim of this thesis \n\nwork. Therefore, one has to take into account the effects that occur on a rough surface \n\nwhen a water droplet touches it. M. Houmard in his PhD Thesis work [10] has described \n\n \n\nFig. 11: Schematics of water contact angle ? formed between liquid drop and solid \n\nsurface as a function of its hydrophobic/hydrophilic characteristics \n\n \n\nFig. 10: Schematics of contact angle ? formed between a liquid drop and a solid surface \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\nthree possible models related to so-called textured surface: 1) Cassie-Baxter\u2019s model [22] \n\nthat describes a chemically heterogeneous surface, 2) Wenzel\u2019s model [23] describing a \n\nrough surface and 3) Bico\u2019s model [24] that relates both previous models describing a \n\nstructure with an open surface porosity. All three models, in general, are described \n\nsimilarly, taking into account interacting surfaces (liquid-liquid, liquid-solid). For instance, \n\nin the Bico\u2019s model, the porous (rough) surface is described as a composite one, one \n\ncomponent being the dry solid itself, the other one being constituted of impregnated water \n\nregions (see Fig. 12). \n\n \n\nIn this case the measured water contact angle ?\n*\n is defined as follows: \n\n        (      )        ( ) \n\nwhere   is the theoretical water contact angle which would be measured on a flat solid \n\nsurface and    is the solid surface fraction. This relation clearly shows that high roughness \n\nor open porosity (small   ) decreases the measured water contact angle, thus increases the \n\nsurface hydrophilicity (    ). \n\n  \n\n \n\nFig. 12: Schematics of water contact angle formed between a liquid drop and a surface \n\nwith an open porosity \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\n3.5.2. Experimental setup \n\nThe water contact angles are measured using a goniometer KR\u00dcSS G10 (see Fig. 13) that \n\nis equipped with a system for image analysis. It consists of a CCD video camera, a card \n\nacquisition connected to a PC and the Drop Shape Analysis (DSA) software for image \n\nprocessing. Environmental chamber has constant temperature (20\no\nC) in it and, therefore, \n\nconstant humidity to ensure that the water drop does not evaporate while measurements are \n\ndone. A water droplet is deposited on the sample surface by the help of syringe with \n\nconstant volume (Vw  ? 1.5\u00b5L) [10]. Cold light source creates a shadow-like pattern of the \n\nwater droplet that is further captured by the CCD camera and analyzed with the DSA \n\nsoftware. Several droplets are deposited on the surface of the sample for more statistical \n\nresults. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nFig. 13: Schema of the device for water contact angle measurements \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\n4. Elaboration \n\nAs it was mentioned before, in this thesis work, our interest is to create a porous/rough \n\nstructure in the TiO2-SiO2 composite material that would increase the natural super-\n\nhydrophilicity effect, i.e. increase the persistence of natural super-hydrophilicity over \n\naging. For this reason, we have defined the basic system of the samples consisting of three \n\nlayers: composite film, PS single-layer and impregnated composite layer. \n\n4.1. Elaboration of TiO2-SiO2 composite films by sol-gel \n\nprocess \n\nBy sol-gel process one can elaborate a network of amorphous oxide via an inorganic \n\npolymerization reaction in liquid solution at ambient temperature. This technique allows \n\nthe creation of thin films resulting from a liquid solution (sol) that, after the evaporation of \n\nsolvent and thermal treatment, forms, respectively, a xerogel (inorganic polymer) film and \n\nan inorganic (oxide) film (see Fig. 14). \n\n \n\nWith M(OR)n group as an alkoxide type precursor, where M is a metal and R is an alkyl \n\nradical, inorganic polymerization is based on the following reactions: \n\n1. Hydrolysis: M(OR)n + H2O ? OH-M(OR)n-1 + ROH \n\n2. Condensation:  \n\na) Oxolation, in case of water liberation: \n\n(OR)nM-OH + OH-M(OR)n ? (OR)nM-O-M(OR)n + H2O \n\nb) Alkoolation, in case of alcohol liberation: \n\n(OR)nM-OH + OR-M(OR)n ? (OR)nM-O-M(OR)n + ROH \n\n \n\nFig. 14: Formation of thin films via sol-gel approach \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nBoth hydrolysis and poly-condensation reactions progress simultaneously in solution. It \n\nleads to polymeric inorganic chains that develop an inorganic network after liquid film \n\ndeposition. The reactivity of sol-gel solutions (length and degree of cross-linking polymer \n\nchains formed from sol-gel reactions) can be controlled by various factors such as \n\nconcentration of reactants (alkoxide, water) and addition of acidic or basic catalyst. These \n\nparameters were studied previously in the work of M. Houmard et al. [10]. In this work, \n\nthe sol-gel principles were adapted to activate the reactive mechanisms in liquid solution in \n\norder to form inorganic TiO2 nano-crystallites in suspension, which could be then diluted \n\nin a polymeric silica sol. \n\n4.2. Elaboration of TiO2-SiO2 composite sols \n\nTiO2-SiO2 composite sols are prepared by mixing a TiO2 crystalline suspension (CS) with \n\na SiO2 sol in various molar ratios. \n\n4.2.1. Crystalline suspension of TiO2 (CS) \n\nA crystalline suspension (CS) of anatase phase TiO2 is prepared from a mother solution \n\n(MS) of polymeric TiO2. To prepare MS, tetraisopropylorthotitanate (TIPT) is mixed with \n\ndistilled water and hydrochloric acid and using absolute ethanol as solvent [25]. TIPT \n\nconcentration in the solution is 0.4M and the molar ratio of TIPT/H2O/HCl is 1/0.82/0.13. \n\nThen, before usage, solution is aged for two days in ambient temperature. A multi-step \n\nprocedure, developed in LMGP [26,27], is then applied to elaborate a CS from the MS. \n\nThe MS is firstly diluted in high amount of deionized water (molar ratio of H2O/TIPT is \n\n90) and autoclaved at 130\no\nC for 6 hours. Autoclaving process leads to the crystallization of \n\nTiO2 nanoparticles of anatase phase diluted in aqueous medium. This crystallization, \n\nresulting from sol-gel reactions in aqueous and acidic conditions, relies on an activation of \n\nthe hydrolysis reaction and slowing down of the poly-condensation reactions via \n\npeptization mechanisms. Nucleation of anatase TiO2 follows from the pure oxide clusters \n\nformed during the process described previously. An exchange procedure is performed in \n\norder to remove the water from the sol and replace it with absolute ethanol. The final \n\nconcentration of TiO2 in ethanol is 0.24M and the CS is composed of nano-particles \n\ncrystallized in the anatase phase with a diameter of about 5-6 nm [6]. Previous studies have \n\nshown that these conditions lead to very stable suspensions that can be used for several \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nweeks in order to elaborate pure TiO2 coatings. In order to obtain TiO2-SiO2 composite \n\nsols, one can mix the CS with a polymeric solution of SiO2. \n\n4.2.2. Polymeric solution of SiO2 (S1) and TiO2-SiO2 composite films \n\nA sol of SiO2 is prepared by diluting tetraethoxylane (TEOS) in absolute ethanol, distilled \n\nwater and hydrochloric acid [28]. First, a solution in ethanol is elaborated with a TEOS \n\nconcentration of 2.35M and a fixed H2O/TEOS molar ratio (Rw) and pH. After, this sol is \n\nsteamed at 60\no\nC for 2 days. Finally, it is diluted in absolute ethanol till the desired \n\nconcentration is obtained. The sol can then be mixed with a CS to form a TiO2-SiO2 \n\ncomposite sol. It is worth mentioning that the TEOS concentration, Rw ratio, and pH \n\nstrongly influence the SiO2 sol reactivity. Increasing this sol-gel reactivity will in turn \n\ninduce long Si-O-Si polymer chains that form the network of SiO2. In his thesis, M. \n\nHoumard has shown that this sol reactivity strongly impacts the physicochemical and \n\nmorphological properties of composite layers, which in turn strongly influence their \n\nhydrophilic properties [10]. Accordingly, sols of weaker reactivity leading to very short \n\nSiO2 polymeric chains were observed to favor a greater number of Ti-O-Si interfaces in \n\nTiO2-SiO2 composite films, which promoted enhanced super-hydrophilic properties, i.e. an \n\nenhanced persistence of the natural super-hydrophilicity. In the present work we wanted to \n\nassess in which extent an increased roughness or porosity could enhance the super-\n\nhydrophilicity of composite films. For this reason, we have chosen to study composite film \n\nof rather weak super-hydrophilicity persistence in order to better assess morphology \n\neffects. Thus, composite films were deposited from a sol of rather strong reactivity based \n\non a TEOS concentration of 1.5M, a Rw ratio of 2.2 and a pH of 3.5. This sol was then \n\nmixed with the CS in various proportions. We have been interested in two different \n\ncomposites with 20mol% (which will be noted S1-20) and 60mol% (S1-60) of SiO2. Pure \n\nTiO2 (S1-0) and SiO2 (S1-100) films have also been deposited from the CS and SiO2 sols, \n\nrespectively. \n\n4.3. Elaboration of TiO2-SiO2 composite films \n\nWhen the composite sols with desired compositions (S1-0, S1-20, S1-60 and S1-100) were \n\nobtained, we used the spin-coating method to elaborate the composite layers. For this \n\npurpose, standard parameters were applied: liquid volume of 300\u00b5L, rotation speed of \n\n3000rpm, duration of rotation of 1s, acceleration of 5000rpm/s. Obtained samples were \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nheated at 500\no\nC for 2 hours to ensure the complete evaporation of the solvent and \n\ndensification of the film. \n\nThis protocol was used to impregnate previously deposited PS films. It was also used to \n\ndeposit TiO2-SiO2 super-hydrophilic films in order to compare how the super-\n\nhydrophilicity influences the deposition of PS films compared to a bare silicon substrate. \n\n  \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n5. Results and discussion \n\n5.1. Elaboration of polystyrene (PS) films \n\nAs the spin-coating deposition of layers composed of polystyrene latex beads (purchased \n\nfrom Sigma \u2013 Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Germany) relies on numerous parameters, one has \n\nfirst to study and define the best deposition conditions and suspension preparation \n\nparameters leading to closely packed PS beads. This optimization work is described in the \n\nnext sections. \n\n5.1.1. Deposition conditions \n\nThe purpose is to define experimental conditions in order to obtain 2D layers of closely \n\npacked polystyrene latex beads with an average diameter d = 0.6\u00b5m. PS beads are supplied \n\nas aqueous suspensions of 10wt% concentration. The colloidal solution in water was \n\ndiluted in solvent in volume proportion 1:9 obtaining a 1wt% PS colloidal suspension. \n\nTheoretical calculations were done to preliminary define the deposition volume necessary \n\nto totally cover a substrate (silicon) of dimensions 3\u00d73cm\n2\n with closely packed (square \n\narrangement) PS beads, taking into account the solution concentration of 1wt%. The \n\ndeposition volume was thus initially fixed at V = 50\u00b5L. \n\nSeveral manipulations (M) with different conditions were then performed \u2018step-by-step\u2019 in \n\norder to optimize the protocol for PS single-layer elaboration on silicon. \n\n5.1.1.1. M1: Standard protocol and influence of solvent \n\nFirst, the standard protocol habitually employed to deposit composite films (3000rpm, 1s \n\nof rotation, 5000rpm/s) was tested with two different PS solutions dissolved in absolute \n\nethanol (EtOH) or H2O. \n\nOptical microscope pictures show that one can obtain similar structures for both solvents: \n\nEtOH and H2O (see Fig. 15). FEG-SEM images show that, although forming small \n\ndomains and still having a lot of large \u2018free\u2019 spaces (i.e. uncoated substrate areas), one can \n\nobtain 2D arrangements of closely packed PS beads with both liquids. However, \n\nmacroscopic observations show that water does not wet correctly the surface of Si \n\nsubstrate. As a result, further experiments were carried by using EtOH as a solvent. \n\nBesides, although the wetting of a PS/EtOH solution was good, the substrate was poorly \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\ncovered at the macroscopic level (coverage rate of around 20%). Therefore other \n\nexperimental conditions were tested in following manipulations. \n\n \n\n5.1.1.2. M2: Effect of the rotation speed and time \n\nSecondly, the effect of the rotation speed and time were tested by combining three \n\ndifferent rotation speeds (1000, 3000 and 5000rpm) and three different rotation times (1, \n\n10 and 30s) while keeping the acceleration at 5000rpm/s (see Fig. 16). \n\nObservations show that the best combination that leads to a higher coverage rate (around \n\n50%) can be obtained with a small rotation speed for a short deposition time. Thus, next \n\nexperimental conditions were defined: 1000rpm, 1s of rotation. To verify the lower limit of \n\nthe rotation speed, a 500rpm speed was also tested. The results show that, although a \n\ndecrease of the rotation speed considerably increases the coverage of the surface (up to \n\n95%), it yields the formation of multi-layers of PS beads when using a silicon substrate. It \n\nwas thus concluded that the choice of a rotation speed of 1000rpm was adequate and \n\nsuitable for further experiments on silicon. \n\n \n\nFig. 15: Optical (top) and FEG-SEM (bottom) images representing the influence of \n\nsolvent by using a standard deposition protocol (3000rpm, 1s of rotation, 5000rpm/s). \n\nThe percentage indicated in optical images corresponds to the coverage rate \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 16: Optical images and graphics represent results of different rotation speeds (1000, \n\n3000 and 5000rpm) and rotation times (1, 10 and 30s) tested with 1wt% PS solution in \n\nEtOH. The percentage indicated in optical images corresponds to the coverage rate, \n\nwhose values are plotted in the above curve as a function of studied rotation speeds and \n\ntimes \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\n5.1.1.3. M3: Acceleration of the turning plate \n\nWhen studying the work of Colson et al. [19], one can see that single-layers of closely \n\npacked PS beads are favored by a long acceleration step in the spin-coating parameters to \n\nimprove the coverage rate. To assess this effect, tests were performed with a rotation speed \n\nof 1000rpm and various accelerations on bare Si substrate. 5000rpm/s was chosen as the \n\nhighest and 100rpm/s as the lowest value of acceleration (see Fig. 17). \n\n \n\nContrary to the work of Colson et al. [19], our results show that a better surface coverage is \n\nobtained with a higher value of acceleration. Thus, 5000rpm/s acceleration was definitively \n\nadopted for next experiments. \n\n5.1.1.4. M4: Reproducibility \n\nThe reproducibility of our protocol was tested on bare silicon substrates for different \n\nexperiments in fixed conditions: 1000rpm, 1s of rotation, 5000rpm/s. In these conditions it \n\ncan be shown that it is possible to reasonably reproduce PS single-layers with an average \n\ncoverage of 53 \u00b1 6%. Results are confirmed also by the FEG-SEM observations (see Fig. \n\n18). \n\n \n\nFig. 17: Optical images representing the influence of the surface coverage when different \n\naccelerations are applied: 5000rpm/s (left) and 100rpm/s (right). The percentage \n\nindicated in optical images corresponds to the coverage rate \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\n \n\n5.1.1.5. M5: Influence of the magnetic agitation and ultrasonic \n\ntreatment \n\nWhen technical conditions, related to spin-coating settings, are defined, another factor that \n\nmight influence the coating quality and reproducibility is the dispersion and stability of PS \n\nbeads in the liquid solution. In this case two mixing methods were tested: magnetic \n\nagitation (MA) and ultrasound dispersion (US). We chose four different timings for US \n\n(5\u2019, 30\u2019, 1h and 2h), and five timings for MA (5\u2019, 1h, 4h, 6h and 23h) for a 1000rpm \n\nrotation speed (see Fig. 19). A longer duration of magnetic or ultrasonic agitation leads to a \n\nslight increase of the coverage rate. However, one can consider that this influence is \n\nrelatively weak. For this reason, a magnetic agitation of two hours has been defined as the \n\noptimal conditions for solution preparation. \n\n \n\nFig. 18: Reproducibility of the samples represented by optical (top) and FEG-SEM \n\n(bottom) images. The percentage indicated in optical images corresponds to the coverage \n\nrate \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 19: Influence of the duration of the ultrasound (US) and magnetic agitation (MA) \n\nrepresented by optical images and graphics. The percentage indicated in optical images \n\ncorresponds to the coverage rate, whose values are plotted in the above curve as a \n\nfunction of studied US and MA durations \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\n5.1.1.6. M6: Influence of the substrate \n\nWe also assessed how the substrate hydrophilicity could influence the deposition of PS \n\nbeads. For this purpose, tests were performed on a silicon substrate preliminary coated \n\nwith a super-hydrophilic composite film and rotation speeds of 500rpm and 1000rpm. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 20: (a) Optical (top) and FEG-SEM (bottom) images representing the influence of a \n\nrotation speed of 500rpm tested on different surfaces: bare Si (left) and Si pre-coated \n\nwith super-hydrophilic film (right); (b) Optical images representing the influence of a \n\nrotation speed of 1000rpm tested on different surfaces: bare Si (left) and Si pre-coated \n\nwith super-hydrophilic film (right) \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nFig. 20 shows that the substrate influence strongly depends on the speed rotation: \n\n1) 500rpm: A strong coverage rate (around 95%) is obtained whatever the substrate \n\nhydrophilicity. However, in contrast to a bare Si substrate (section 5.1.1.2), in the \n\ncase of a pre-coated substrate the multi-layer formation is observed only in some \n\nlocalized regions where particle aggregates are formed, and the major part of the \n\nsubstrate is covered with an aggregate-free 2D layer of closely packed PS particles \n\n(see Fig. 20a). \n\n2) 1000rpm: A 2D layer of closely packed PS particles is obtained whatever the \n\nsubstrate hydrophilicity. However, compared to a bare Si substrate, the pre-\n\ndeposition of a super-hydrophilic coating strongly enhances the coverage rate from \n\nabout 50% to about 75% (see Fig. 20b). \n\nThus, these observations open the way to different options of PS particle coatings for the \n\nsubsequent impregnation of composite sols. \n\n5.1.2. Parameters for suspension preparation \n\nOnce the technical (spin-coating) parameters and deposition conditions are better \n\ndetermined, one has to improve and determine the parameters of the solution preparation \n\nthat influence the surface coverage. New studies (NS), performed on bare Si substrates, are \n\ndiscussed in the following sub-sections. \n\n5.1.2.1. NS1: Influence of concentration \n\nFirst of all, different concentrations of PS in EtOH were tested. Different dilution rates of \n\nthe initial 10wt% PS solution in water were chosen: dilution by a factor 0, 2, 5 and 10 that \n\ncorresponds, respectively, to solutions with a 10, 5, 2 and 1wt% concentration. Deposition \n\non both, bare Si and Si substrates coated with a super-hydrophilic film were performed for \n\n1000rpm rotation conditions (see Fig. 21). \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe observations show that a quasi-complete surface coverage can be obtained already \n\nwith a PS concentration of 2wt% whatever the substrate hydrophilicity. However, one \n\nstarts to observe the formation of rather inhomogeneous multi-layer regions that are not \n\nnecessarily favorable to the objective of the work: post-impregnation of a composite sol. \n\nTherefore a PS concentration of 1wt% was definitely retained for further studies. \n\n \n\nFig. 21: Influence of the PS solution concentration represented by optical (top, middle) \n\nand FEG-SEM (bottom) images. The percentage indicated in optical images corresponds \n\nto the coverage rate \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\n5.1.2.2. NS2: Influence of deposited volume \n\nAnother parameter to be assessed is the volume of deposited solution, so that the layer \n\ncovers the whole substrate. Four values of deposition volume were chosen: 50, 100, 250 \n\nand 500\u00b5L for a bare Si substrate coated at 1000rpm with a 1wt% solution (see Fig. 22). \n\nAs a result, when observed with OM, one can see that the coverage rate does not depend \n\nsignificantly on the deposited volume (see Fig. 22a). However, macroscopic observations \n\nshow that the substrate is completely covered when the deposition volume is V = 100\u00b5L \n\n(see Fig. 22b). Accordingly, V = 100\u00b5L has been defined as the deposition volume of the \n\nPS/EtOH solution (instead of the calculated volume, V = 50\u00b5L, used in previous studies). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 22: Influence of the deposited volume of the solution (on Si substrate) observed in \n\n(a) microscopic scale with OM and (b) comparison of two samples in macroscopic scale. \n\nThe percentage indicated in optical images corresponds to the coverage rate \n\n \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\n5.1.3. Conclusion: Model conditions \n\nFinally, one can summarize this experimental work by model conditions yielding most \n\npromising results to obtain PS 2D layers on bare Si substrates as well as on hydrophilic \n\npre-coated substrates (see Table 1). These model conditions will be used for following \n\nstudies. \n\nTable 1: Summary of model conditions to obtain PS 2D layers \n\nCondition Value \n\nDeposition volume 100\u00b5L \n\nRotation speed 500rpm or 1000rpm \n\nDuration of rotation 1s \n\nAcceleration 5000rpm/s \n\n \n\nBesides, owing to better results obtained on hydrophilic substrates, we have chosen this \n\noption in the following parts of this work. Accordingly, PS 2D layers were deposited on \n\nsub-layers of four different composite materials: S1-0 (pure TiO2), S1-20, S1-60 and S1-\n\n100 (pure SiO2). Composite sub-layers were deposited as described in section 4.3. After \n\ndeposition of PS beads, samples were placed for 5 min into a furnace at 110\no\nC to ensure \n\nthe complete evaporation of the solvent and better attachment of PS beads onto the sub-\n\nlayer. Then, the bi-layer samples were impregnated with a composite sol with a \n\ncomposition identical to that of the sub-layer. This impregnation was done by spin-coating \n\nin conditions used for sub-layer deposition (section 4.3). After impregnation, the samples \n\nwere placed for 2 hours in a furnace at 500\no\nC to ensure the calcination of PS particles and \n\nsubsequent creation of a porous/rough structure in the composite films. \n\n5.2. Study of PS + composite multilayer films \n\n5.2.1. Preliminary observations \n\nPreliminary experiments of impregnation were done with a S1-60 TiO2-SiO2 composite \n\nsol. The samples were observed by optical microscopy, first of all just after deposition of \n\nPS beads at 1000rpm on a super-hydrophilic sub-layer, and then after post-impregnation of \n\nthe composite sol and thermal treatment. As well, FEG-SEM characterization was done to \n\nverify the surface structure and obtain information on the morphologic characteristics of \n\nthe samples (see Fig. 23). \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n\nAs it is seen from Fig. 23, after impregnation and thermal treatment (2h at 500\no\nC) is done, \n\none can observe that the pattern of PS layer is maintained, i.e. the coverage rate. FEG-SEM \n\nimages show that the composite material enrobes the PS beads and, after calcination, the \n\ncomposite material adopts a particulate morphology with a geometry very similar to that of \n\nthe initial PS coating, which probably suggests that the composite coating exhibits a porous \n\nshell-like structure. This structure would arise from the capping of previously deposited PS \n\nbeads by the composite sol, followed by the burning out of PS beads during calcination. \n\n \n\nFig. 23: Optical (left) images characterizing samples before (top) and after (bottom) \n\nimpregnation with hydrophilic TiO2-SiO2 composite S1-60. The FEG-SEM images (top \n\nview and tilted sample view) on right illustrate morphology of a composite coating after \n\npost-impregnation. The percentage indicated in optical images corresponds to the \n\ncoverage rate \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nThe next try was to test the impregnated volume of composite sol. The previously defined \n\nvolume 300\u00b5L was increased 2 and 3 times: 600\u00b5L and 900\u00b5L, respectively. As it is seen \n\nin Fig. 24, the increase of the composite sol volume for the impregnation layer does not \n\nchange significantly the morphology of the composite surface. Thus, the volume for \n\nimpregnations was defined as Vcomp = 300\u00b5L for further experiments. \n\n \n\n5.2.2. Study of reference composite films \n\nReference composite films directly deposited on Si substrates without PS beads were then \n\ninvestigated. Roughness of the surface was studied by FEG-SEM and AFM and \n\ncharacterized by RMS (Root Mean Square, measured in nm) function. Fig. 25 shows that \n\nthe surface roughness of reference S1-0, S1-20 and S1-60 composite films are as follows: \n\nRMSS1-0 = 4.8nm, RMSS1-20 = 4.6nm and RMSS1-60 = 3.6nm. No roughness could be \n\nmeasured on a S1-100 film, which indicates a very smooth surface of the pure SiO2 film. \n\nAs it is seen, the RMS values are not high in none of the cases. \n\n \n\nFig. 24: Optical images (top) representing different composite impregnation volumes and \n\nFEG-SEM images (bottom) representing the surface morphology after impregnation of \n\nthe composite sol (top view and tilted sample view). The percentage indicated in optical \n\nimages corresponds to the coverage rate \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nFig. 25: FEG-SEM (left) and AFM (2D in middle, 3D on right) images to represent the \n\nmorphology and roughness of composite films S1-0, S1-20, S1-60 and S1-100 directly \n\ndeposited on Si substrates \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nThe evolutions of water contact angle over aging of these reference films are illustrated in \n\nFig. 26. It is observed that pure TiO2 (S1-0) and SiO2 (S1-100) films rapidly lose their \n\ninitial super-hydrophilicity. In comparison, the super-hydrophilicity loss is slower for S1-\n\n20 and S1-60 composite films, which provides new illustration of the specific wettability \n\nproperties of such films. However, compared to best films optimized in the thesis of M. \n\nHoumard, as illustrated in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the super-hydrophilicity loss of S1-20 and S1-\n\n60 films over aging is much faster in the present case. As explained before, it is due to the \n\nmuch greater sol-gel reactivity of SiO2 sols chosen in the present work compared to the \n\nvery weak reactivity of best sols optimized by M. Houmard. It should also be noticed that \n\naging data illustrated in Fig. 26 exhibit some experimental dispersion and that pure TiO2 \n\n(S1-0) films yield more dispersed wettability data over aging than other studied \n\ncompositions. In agreement with previous studies performed at LMGP, this greater \n\ndispersion depicts that, compared to other compositions, pure TiO2 films exhibit a greater \n\nsensitivity to fluctuations of the pollution conditions over aging, for example relative \n\nhumidity and/or temperature variations of the room atmosphere. \n\n \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn the following, we study how the pre-deposition of PS beads influences the roughness of \n\ncomposite coatings, and how roughness effects influence the wettability of such coatings \n\ncompared to those directly deposited on silicon substrates without PS beads. \n\n  \n\n \n\nFig. 26: Kinetics of water contact angle increase over aging for four different composite \n\nmaterials directly deposited on silicon without PS beads. The main figure compares the \n\nkinetics measured on S1-20 (?) and S1-60 (?) films. The insert compares the same \n\nvariations for S1-0 (?) and S1-100 (?) films. For each composition, two series of \n\nsamples were studied \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\n5.3. Morphology of PS + composite films \n\nFirst of all, concerning PS beads deposition, one has to remind that two different \n\nexperiments (with rotation speeds of 500rpm and 1000rpm) were held in parallel. As it was \n\nmentioned before, the morphology of samples was studied with FEG-SEM and AFM \n\nmeasurements and characterized by RMS function. Morphological characteristics arising \n\nfrom both studied rotation speeds for S1-0+PS, S1-20+PS, S1-60+PS and S1-100+PS \n\ncomposite films are summarized in Fig. 27, Fig. 28, Fig. 29 and Fig. 30, respectively. \n\n5.3.1. Surface coverage \n\nFirst of all, one can observe that the lower rotation speed (500rpm) yields higher surface \n\ncoverage that is confirmed with both optical microscope images (threshold statistics) and \n\nAFM images. Optical images (see top pictures) show that well dispersed coated regions \n\nconstituted of homogeneous particles can be obtained with three composites: S1-0+PS, S1-\n\n20+PS and S1-60+PS. Meanwhile, in the case of composites S1-100+PS (pure SiO2 with \n\nPS), the coverage rate is strangely weaker and one observes the formation of rather \n\ncontinuous coated areas coexisting with large zones without any coating. These \n\nobservations are confirmed also by AFM images (compare middle images of Fig. 27 to \n\nFig. 30). Particular features observed in case of the S1-100+PS composite films are not yet \n\nexplained and further research must be done. \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 27: Optical (top), AFM (2D and 3D in the middle) and FEG-SEM (bottom) images \n\nrepresent general and more detailed structures of S1-0 composite film.

RMS Roughness \n\n3D representations in AFM images (see the third row in Fig. 27 to Fig. 30) confirm that the \n\nroughness of the samples is considerably increased by composite impregnation on the 2D \n\nlayer of PS nanoparticles in both experiments (with rotation speeds 1000rpm and 500rpm) \n\ncomparing to pure reference composite films. All RMS roughness values are summarized \n\nin Table 2. \n\nTable 2: RMS roughness values of composite films and composite + PS films of two \n\nexperiments with different rotations speeds (1000rpm and 500rpm) \n\nComposite RMS value of \n\ncomposite films, \n\nnm \n\nRMS value of composite + PS \n\nfilms, nm \n1000rpm                500rpm \n\nS1-0 4.8 176 187 \n\nS1-20 4.6 138 200 \n\nS1-60 3.6 167 189 \n\nS1-100 2.7\n*\n 74 20 \n\n*\nfor comparison, this value is extracted from M. Houmard\u2019s thesis work [10] \n\nAs seen from data in Table 2, in the case of S1-0+PS, S1-20+PS and S1-60+PS \n\ncomposites, the deposition of a 2D PS beads layer before composite impregnation leads to \n\nan increase of the RMS value by about two orders of magnitude. In contrast, S1-100+PS \n\nfilms show much lower RMS values. In addition, while in cases of S1-0+PS, S1-20+PS \n\nand S1-60+PS composites the RMS value increases with the increase of the surface \n\ncoverage rate, i.e. the decrease of the rotation speed, the RMS value of S1-100+PS \n\ncomposite films strongly decreases. On the one hand and as mentioned before, the results \n\nfor S1-100+PS films are not yet clear and further research must be done. On the other \n\nhand, further attention must be paid to other three samples S1-0+PS, S1-20+PS and S1-\n\n60+PS, as illustrated in Fig. 31. This figure compiles roughness and coverage rate data of \n\nthese samples for both studied rotation speeds. It appears that the film roughness \n\ncontinuously increases with the coverage rate of PS beads, irrespectively of the TiO2-SiO2 \n\ncomposition. It means that the final morphology is essentially controlled by the surface \n\ndensity of initially deposited PS beads. \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3.3. Rough/porous structures \n\nFinally, FEG-SEM images are used to complete this analyze on the surface morphology of \n\ncomposite + PS films. These images confirm the rough structure that is obtained after post-\n\nimpregnation of composite sols on a 2D layer of PS beads (see the fourth row in Fig. 27 to \n\nFig. 30). All these observations allow concluding that, except in case of S1-100 films, the \n\ndeposition of PS beads and post-impregnation of composite sols leads to films with \n\nstrongly rough surface morphology compared to naturally smooth films directly deposited \n\non silicon. \n\n \n\nFig. 31: Quantitative comparison of film surface roughness as a function of the surface \n\ncoverage rate for S1-0(+PS) (?), S1-20(+PS) (?) and S1-60(+PS) (?) films deposited \n\nwith rotation speed 1000rpm and 500rpm. In this compilation, rotation speeds are not \n\ndistinguished. The line is drawn to guide the eye \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\n5.4. Water contact angle of composite + PS films \n\nWater contact angles measured over 6 (experiment with 500rpm) and 11 (experiment with \n\n1000rpm) weeks of aging on S1-X+PS composite films are summarized in Fig. 32 and \n\ncompared to reference films without PS beads (data from Fig. 26). \n\nAs one can observe, compared to water contact angle measurements for reference \n\ncomposite films without PS, the super-hydrophilicity persistence is considerably increased \n\nin three cases: S1-0+PS, S1-20+PS and S1-60+PS. These observations are coherent with \n\nmorphology features illustrated in Fig. 25 to Fig. 30, showing that the strong roughness \n\nincrease induced by PS beads for S1-0+PS, S1-20+PS and S1-60+PS composite films \n\npromotes an important super-hydrophilicity enhancement. In contrast, S1-100+PS \n\ncomposite films do not show any improvement compared to reference S1-100 films. It \n\neven seems that the super-hydrophilicity loss is faster in the former case for the 1000rpm \n\nspeed. These observations confirm that S1-100+PS films constitute a particular case that \n\nwill require further studies for better understanding. Finally, it should be mentioned that, \n\nwhile PS beads strongly reduce the super-hydrophilicity loss of S1-0 films, aging data for \n\nS1-0+PS films are still very dispersed compared to S1-20+PS and S1-60+PS films, which \n\nis in agreement with data illustrated in Fig. 26 in the absence of PS beads. \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 32: Kinetics of water contact increase over aging for S1-X composite films \n\ndeposited on silicon and S1-X+PS films deposited with a rotation speed of 500rpm (top) \n\nand 1000rpm (bottom). Main figures compare the kinetics measured on S1-20 films with \n\n(?) or without PS (?) and S1-60 films with (?) or without PS (?). The inserts compare \n\nthe same variations for S1-0 films with (?) or without PS (?) and S1-100 films with (?) \n\nor without PS (?) \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nThese observations are completed in Fig. 33, which compares the water contact angle \n\nmeasured after 6 weeks of aging on reference composite samples and S1-X+PS samples \n\nobtained from both studied rotation speeds. This figure shows that, while roughness \n\nfeatures enhance the super-hydrophilicity persistence of S1-0+PS, S1-20+PS and S1-\n\n60+PS samples, wettability properties are much better on both latter samples, which \n\nprovides new evidence of the intrinsic effects of TiO2-SiO2 granular interfaces on the \n\nsuper-hydrophilicity of composite films. Besides, Fig. 33 suggests that the rotation speed \n\nalso influences the wettability properties of these samples. As explained before, the \n\nrotation speed used for PS beads deposition controls their coverage rate, which in turn \n\ngoverns the final roughness of S1-X+PS composite films. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 33: Water contact angle measured after 6 weeks of aging under ambient atmosphere \n\nwithout UV irradiation as a function of the SiO2 sol molar composition: reference \n\ncomposite samples (?, a)  and composite + PS films with rotation speeds 1000rpm (?, b) \n\nand 500rpm (?, c).  Data of Fig. 33a correspond to average values derived from Fig. 26. \n\nData of Fig. 33b have been extrapolated from fits presented in Fig. 32. The lines are \n\ndrawn to guide the eye \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\nAccordingly, we have compiled in Fig. 34 water contact angle values measured after 6 \n\nweeks of aging on S1-20 and S1-60 films formed in the absence or in the presence of PS \n\nbeads deposited with both rotation speeds. In this figure, we have not presented data \n\nderived from S1-0+PS and S1-100+PS samples owing to dispersed data arising from the \n\nformers and specific features arising from the latters. It seems that, while roughness effects \n\ninduced by PS beads strongly enhance the super-hydrophilicity persistence of both kinds of \n\ncomposite films, this influence is not necessarily confirmed when the roughness increases \n\nabout a certain threshold value. It would suggest that above this threshold, roughness and \n\ncomposition effects are not the only ones involved in the wettability of composite films. Of \n\ncourse, this observation will require future experiments to draw more precise conclusions. \n\n  \n\n \n\nFig. 34: Influence of the film surface roughness on the water contact angle values \n\nmeasured after 6 weeks of aging under ambient atmosphere without UV radiation for S1-\n\n20(+PS) (?) and S1-60(+PS) (?) films deposited with rotation speeds 1000rpm and \n\n500rpm (data are from Fig. 33). In this compilation, rotation speeds are not distinguished \n\nand the line is drawn to guide the eye \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\n6. Conclusions \n\nIn this work, we have shown that it is possible to create sample surfaces with 2D layers of \n\nclosely packed and well arranged PS beads of diameter 0.6?m by spin-coating method. \n\nAfter calcination of PS beads, post-impregnated TiO2-SiO2 composite sols, which naturally \n\nyield a rather small surface roughness when deposited on Si substrate, lead to an artificially \n\nrough/porous surface morphology of S1-X+PS films with a RMS roughness value \n\nincreased by about two orders of magnitude compared to similar films deposited without \n\nPS beads. Compared to reference films without PS, water contact angle measurements on \n\ncomposite + PS films have shown a strong increase of super-hydrophilicity persistence, \n\nespecially for composite films S1-20+PS and S1-60+PS. The super-hydrophilicity of these \n\nfilms persists often 6 weeks of aging under ambient atmosphere without UV radiation, i.e. \n\nthe water contact angle remains close to 5\no\n. For both films composition, this work also \n\nsuggests some relation between: 1) the surface coverage of PS beads, 2) the surface \n\nroughness/porosity of S1-X+PS films, and 3) the super-hydrophilicity persistence of these \n\nfilms. Further studies are required to precise this relation, which introduces future \n\nperspectives to this work. \n\nSeveral parameters concerning PS films elaboration, such as PS beads size, solution \n\nconcentration, rotation speed and time, acceleration, deposition volume etc., that all might \n\ninfluence the creation of closely-packed single-layer of PS beads, must be further studied \n\nin order to vary the surface coverage, which in turn controls the values of post-\n\nimpregnation RMS roughness. This effect is already observed when comparing both \n\nexperiments with different rotation speeds (1000rpm and 500rpm). As well, other \n\nconditions that concern TiO2-SiO2 composite sols, such as solution concentration, \n\ndeposition volume etc., must be tested so that the post-impregnation of composite sols \n\nwould lead to surface morphologies varied in an extended range of roughness/porosity. \n\nFurther studies in that sense are presently in progress.  \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\n7.
