A\nabordagem adoptada foi o desenvolvimento de uma configurac?a?o re-\ngional de alta resoluc?a?o num modelo ocea?nico, capaz de reproduzir a\ndina?mica de larga e pequena escala na zona de transic?a?o costeira.\nQuatro experie?ncias nume?ricas foram efectuadas para este efeito: (1)\numa corrida climatolo?gica, a fim de estudar o comportamento sazonal\ndo sistema e caracterizar o estado me?dio; (2) uma corrida forc?ada com\nventos e fluxos reais para o per??odo de 2001-2011, a fim de estudar a\nvariabilidade inter-anual do sistema; (3) uma corrida forc?ada com cam-\npos me?dios de modelos clima?ticos globais (GCMs) para o presente,\na fim de validar GCMs como forc?amento adequado para modelac?a?o\nocea?nica regional; (4) semelhante a? corrida (3) para o per??odo 2071-\n2100, a fim de avaliar poss??veis conseque?ncias de um cena?rio clima?tico\nfuturo na hidrografia e dina?mica da WIM. Para ale?m disso, foram real-\nizados dois estudos com part??culas Lagrangianas: um a fim de trac?ar a\norigem das a?guas afloradas ao longo da WIM; outro a fim de retratar\nos padro?es de dispersa?o, acumulac?a?o e conectividade larval.\nConstatou-se que a configurac?a?o nume?rica e? adequada para a re-\nproduc?a?o do estado me?dio do sistema, caracterizac?a?o sazonal e estudo\nda variabilidade inter-anual. Concluiu-se que ha? prevale?ncia de escoa-\nmento para o po?lo junto a? vertente, fluxo este que co-existe com o jacto\nde afloramento no Vera?o, embora haja evide?ncia do seu desvio para o\nlargo, e que esta? associado ao escoamento da A?gua Mediterra?nica nos\nn??veis inferiores, sugerindo um cara?cter barotro?pico. Da aplicac?a?o de\num futuro cena?rio clima?tico retiraram-se as seguintes concluso?es: ha?\num aquecimento e um decre?scimo de salinidade generalizados nos n??veis\nsuperiores; a tende?ncia para o escoamento para o po?lo mante?m-se, e\napesar da intensificac?a?o dos ventos favora?veis ao afloramento no Vera?o\na respectiva banda costeira esta? mais restringida em largura e profun-\ndidade. No que diz respeito a? conectividade e dispersa?o larval ao longo\nda WIM, observou-se que a migrac?a?o vertical diurna aumenta o recru-\ntamento em todo o dom??nio, e enquanto que as linhas de costa mais\nsuaves sa?o melhores fornecedores, ha? maior acumulac?a?o em zonas de\ntopografia mais recortada.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeywords Iberian Peninsula, coastal upwelling, climate change, IPCC, regional\nocean modeling, ROMS, coastal dynamics, hydrography, ecosystem,\nlarvae, mean state, interannual variability.\n\nAbstract The purpose of this work is to carry out a comprehensive study on\nthe Western Iberian Margin (WIM) circulation my means of numerical\nmodeling, and to postulate what this circulation will be in the future.\nThe adopted approach was the development of a regional ocean model\nconfiguration with high resolution, capable of reproducing the large-\nand small-scale dynamics of the coastal transition zone.\nFour numerical experiences were carried out according to these objec-\ntives: (1) a climatological run, in order to study the system\u2019s seasonal\nbehavior and its mean state; (2) a run forced with real winds and fluxes\nfor period 2001-2011 in order to study the interannual variability of the\nsystem; (3) a run forced with mean fields from Global Climate Models\n(GCMs) for the present, in order to validate GCMs as adequate forcing\nfor regional ocean modeling; (4) a similar run (3) for period 2071-2100,\nin order to assess possible consequences of a future climate scenario\non the hydrography and dynamics of the WIM. Furthermore, two La-\ngrangian particle studies were carried out: one in order to trace the\norigin of the upwelled waters along the WIM; the other in order to\nportrait the patterns of larval dispersal, accumulation and connectivity.\nThe numerical configuration proved to be adequate in the reproduction\nof the system\u2019s mean state, seasonal characterization and an interan-\nnual variability study. There is prevalence of poleward flow at the\nslope, which coexists with the upwelling jet during summer, although\nthere is evidence of its shifting offshore, and which is associated with\nthe Mediterranean Water flow at deeper levels, suggesting a barotropic\ncharacter. From the future climate scenario essay, the following con-\nclusions were drawn: there is general warming and freshening of upper\nlevel waters; there is still poleward tendency, and despite the upwelling-\nfavorable winds strengthening in summer the respective coastal band\nbecomes more restricted in width and depth. In what concerns larval\nconnectivity and dispersion along the WIM, diel vertical migration was\nobserved to increase recruitment throughout the domain, and while\nsmooth coastlines are better suppliers, there is higher accumulation\nwhere the topography is rougher.\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\nContents i\n\nList of Figures v\n\nList of Tables ix\n\n1 Introduction 1\n1.1 Overview, Motivation and

natives because,\nwith a shape strongly resembling a rectangle, two of its four sides are bathed by ocean. For\na small country (roughly 92,000 km2), it possesses almost 1,000 km of coast (islands not\nincluded). Therefore, the sea has always played a major role throughout its history, since\nbefore the Discovery travels in the 15th and 16th centuries. Furthermore, the ocean has\nalways provided numerous resources, and was once the sole means of income for the major-\nity of the port towns along the Portuguese coast. Portugal\u2019s location, besides bestowing it\nwith the most tender of climates, is most fortunate for fisheries, since it corresponds to an\nocean eastern boundary and therefore favorable for the occurrence of coastal upwelling, a\nphenomenon that strongly stimulates primary productivity. Fisheries are still an important\ntrade nowadays.\n\nMoreover, it is well known that the ocean is a key factor of the climate system; it\nabsorbs large quantities of heat in the tropics and re-distributes it throughout the planet\nby means of the large-scale ocean currents that compose the thermohaline circulation (e.g.\nPond and Pickard, 1983). The ocean is also a very efficient CO2 sink, which has been\nof the utmost importance given the alarming increase of this greenhouse gas emission in\nthe last decades, and the consequent increase in global temperatures (e.g. Hansen et al.,\n2010). How much heat and CO2 can the ocean absorb, and how have these quantities\nchanged in the past decades, have been questions addressed by many environmental works\n(e.g. Levitus et al., 2001; Levitus et al., 2012). The warming of the world\u2019s oceans has\nalso been increasingly documented in recent years (e.g. Levitus et al., 2000, 2005; Casey\nand Cornillon, 2001; Domingues et al., 2008; among others).\n\nThese considerations are also true for the coastal ocean. Coastal thermohaline char-\nacteristics define the marine species that inhabit these waters and their life cycle and mi-\ngration patterns, whereas the regional hydrography defines the regional dynamics and the\nway these properties are transported. In the case of Portugal, for a country so dependent\non maritime resources for its economy, whether directly related like fisheries or indirectly\n\n1\n\n\n\nrelated like tourism, understanding the dynamics of the coastal ocean and studying present\nand future changes at different space and time scales becomes relevant.\n\nThe aim of this work was to carry out, by means of numerical modeling, a compre-\nhensive study of the Western Iberian coastal ocean circulation at the upper levels. First,\na thorough description of its seasonality and mean hydrography and dynamics was per-\nformed, including an essay on the origin of upwelled waters in summer. Second, a study\nfocusing on the system\u2019s interannual variability followed, based on an 11-year simulation\nand the analysis of temperature anomalies, salinity, and meridional transport. By the\napplication of a climate change future scenario to our ocean model, the consequences at\nthe ocean\u2019s upper layers were evaluated in terms of mean thermohaline distribution and\ndynamics. Finally, a Lagrangian module was applied in order to address larval distribution\nand behavior in this region. The region and sub-regions are described in section 1.3. The\nregional modeling configurations are described in section 1.4, and all the respective runs\nare summarized in section 1.5.\n\n1.2 The Eastern North Atlantic Ocean\n\nThe North Atlantic (Figure 1.1, after Tomczak and Godfrey, 2003) is dominated at\nmid-latitudes by the typical Subtropical Gyre, which is composed by the Gulf Stream,\nflowing northeastward along the eastern North America coast that in turn bifurcates at\nabout 40oN, 45oW into two other large-scale currents: the North Atlantic Current, which\nflows northward/northeastward into the Arctic Ocean, and the Azores Current (AzC),\nwhich consists in the northern limit of the gyre. Within the gyre at the bottom of the\nocean lies the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), a strong bathymetric feature that splits the\nNorth Atlantic into approximately two halves (an eastern and a western one), and reaches\nin average 2000 m but can rise to less than 1000 m (Tomczak and Godfrey, 2003). The\nAzC crosses the MAR at about 35oN, 45oW, after which it flows eastward in a mostly\nzonal pathway along ? 34oN. In the proximity of the European southwestern coast, it\nveers southward, partly recirculating in the Gulf of Cadiz (Peliz et al., 2007) and partly\njoining the Canary Current along the northwestern African coast (Barton et al., 1998).\nThe loop of the gyre closes with the westward-flowing North Equatorial Current that links\nto the Gulf Stream by means of the Central America eastern coast complex current system\n(Tomczak and Godfrey, 2003). The eastern boundary current system is concluded with\nthe weak large-scale current that flows mostly southward along the Iberian Peninsula,\nfrequently named the Portugal Current, with typical velocities of a few centimeters per\nsecond (Saunders, 1982).\n\nThe Eastern North Atlantic is one of the world\u2019s main eastern boundary current sys-\ntems, also called Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems. Eastern boundaries have in com-\nmon the fact that, in summer, atmospheric high-pressure systems relocate to the mid-\nlatitudes and in the proximity of the western coasts. In particular for the Eastern North\nAtlantic, the wind regime is dictated by the relative location of the anticyclonic system of\nthe Azores High and the cyclonic system of the Iceland Low.

(a) North Atlantic; (b) Eastern North\nAtlantic Basin (ENAB); (c) Iberian Basin; (d) Western Iberian Margin (WIM). The main\ncurrents are shown for the North Atlantic (after Tomczak and Godfrey, 2003): the Gulf\nStream (GS); the North Atlantic Current (NAC); the Azores Current (AzC); the Canary\nCurrent (CC); the Portugal Current (PC); the North Equatorial Current (NEC). The\n200-m, 1000-m and 2000-m isobaths are shown and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) is\nindicated.\n\n3\n\n\n\nHigh oscillates between northern locations off the Iberian Peninsula during summer and a\nsouthern position during winter in front of Morocco, while the Iceland low intensifies leaving\nroom to the eastward passage of low pressure systems, that introduce a strong variability\nin the circulation at the Iberian Peninsula during wintertime. These atmospheric regimes\nare the reason why in late spring and summer there is coastal upwelling. Its dynamics will\nbe further discussed in section 1.3.1.\n\nThe eastern North Atlantic upwelling system differs from the others in that it is in-\nterrupted in the Strait of Gibraltar, being divided in a northern upwelling region \u2014 the\nwestern coast of the Iberian Peninsula \u2014 and a southern one in the region of the Canary\nCurrent. That is why this system is also called the Canary Upwelling System (Barton et\nal., 1998). The Strait of Gibraltar divides the Atlantic Ocean from the Mediterranean Sea,\nenclosed between Europe and Africa. This gap between the two continents gives rise to the\nother most important dynamical feature of this region: the Mediterranean Water outflow\ninto the Atlantic, further detailed in section 1.3.2.\n\nThis is thus the environment of the small region under scope that is the coastal tran-\nsition zone off the western coast of the Iberian Peninsula, henceforth called the Western\nIberian Margin (WIM), described below. The main rivers and topographic features are\nshown in Figure 1.2 b.\n\n1.3 The Western Iberian Margin (WIM)\n\n1.3.1 Shelf/Slope Circulation\n\na. Coastal Upwelling\nThe summer mid-latitude high pressure systems described in the previous section pro-\n\nduce equatorward winds (northerly in the northern hemisphere, southerly in the southern\nhemisphere) along the coast, which results in an offshore displacement of surface warm\nwaters and rising of deep, cool, nutrient-rich waters to replace them (e.g. Wooster et al.,\n1976). When the wind blows, a current is created at the ocean surface with a direction\n45o to the right of the wind direction (northern hemisphere) due to the Coriolis effect.\nThe action of wind stress is felt in the water column down to the basis of the so-called\nEkman layer, which has typical several tens of meters (<100 m). In this layer, successive\nwater levels undergo the same effect as the surface, that is, deflection of velocity to the\nright, while the velocity\u2019s module weakens in depth. The result is a spiral with a net water\ntransport perpendicular to wind stress \u2014 the Ekman transport, which can be computed\nas follows:\n\n?QEK =\n?? \u00d7 ?k\nf\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere ?? is the wind stress, ?k is the unitary vector perpendicular to ?? and f = 2? sin ?\nis the Coriolis parameter (? is the rotational velocity of the Earth and ? the latitude).\n\n4\n\n\n\n  30\no\nW   20\n\no\nW   10\n\no\nW \n\n  32\no\nN \n\n  36\no\nN \n\n  40\no\nN \n\n  44\no\nN \n\n  48\no\nN \n\nMAR\n\nAI\n\nMI\n\nGC\nSG\n\nBB\n\nAzC\n\nPC\n\nCC\n\nIPC\n\na)\n\n  12\no\nW   10\n\no\nW    8\n\no\nW    6\n\no\nW \n\n  36\no\nN \n\n  38\no\nN \n\n  40\no\nN \n\n  42\no\nN \n\n  44\no\nN \n\nCF\n\nEP\n\nCC\n\nCSV\n\nCO\n\nCS\n\nGR\n\nCE\n\nGB\n\nBG\n\nMin\nho\n\nDou\nro\n\nVouga\n\nMo\nnd\n\neg\no\n\nT\nej\n\no\n\nS\nado\n\nb)\n\nFigure 1.2: Map of the two main regions of study, corresponding to the two numerical\nconfigurations. (a) the large domain (FD) and a schematics of the mean currents. Coastline\nfeatures labeled in black (BB: Bay of Biscay; GC: Gulf of Cadiz; SG: Strait of Gibraltar; AI:\nAzores Islands; MI: Madeira Islands). Dynamical features labeled in blue (IPC: Iberian\nPoleward Current; PC: Portugal Current; AzC: Azores Current; CC: Canary Current).\n(b) the high-resolution domain (SD) marked with the main bathymetric and topographic\nfeatures: Cape St Vincent (CSV), Gorringe Bank (BG), Cape Sines (CS), Cape Espichel\n(CE), Estremadura Promontory (EP), Cape Carvoeiro (CC), Galicia Bank (GB), Galicia\nRias (GR), Cape Finisterre (CF) and Cape Ortegal (CO). Isobaths 200 m and 2000 m are\nshown in black, and 1000 m in gray. The main rivers are also indicated in white.\n\n5\n\n\n\nThe Ekman transport causes divergence at the upper layers (lowering of the sea surface\nat the coastal boundary). This in turn causes convergence in the lower layers, inducing\nonshore motion. These waters then rise when approaching the coast and replace the ones\nadvected offshore.\n\nThese upwelled waters are then advected equatorward because a coastal jet is created\ndue to the rising of the isotherms and the geostrophic balance that is created between the\nconsequent pressure gradient and the Coriolis force. This alongshore jet has its maximum\nspeed at mid-shelf, weakening seaward and also toward the coast due to friction.\n\nAnother mechanism that generates vertical upward velocities is the Ekman pumping,\nwhich occurs due to wind stress curl near the coast. This curl exists because, when ap-\nproaching land, wind stress decreases due to friction. Vertical velocities due to Ekman\npumping are computed as follows:\n\nwEK =\n1\n\n?f\n\n?\n??y\n?x\n\n?\n??x\n?y\n\n?\n(1.2)\n\nLower level waters are rich in nutrients and thus promote phytoplankton blooms when\nreaching the surface, which in turn are the crucial factor for primary productivity (Relvas\net al., 2007). This is why upwelling systems are some of the most productive regions of\nthe world\u2019s ocean.\n\nb. Poleward Flow\nBesides the upwelling circulation during late spring and summer, the large-scale temper-\n\nature and salinity meridional gradients (Peliz et al., 2003b), which dictate the thermohaline\nstructure of the water masses, together with wind forcing, promote a system of poleward\ncurrents along the Atlantic Iberian Peninsula observed mainly during autumn and winter,\nas described in the classic references of Frouin et al. (1990) and Haynes and Barton (1990)\nfor the western Iberian Peninsula, and continuing along the Bay of Biscay as described by\nPingree and Le Cann (1990). This northward circulation is typical of mid-latitude eastern\ncontinental margins (Neshyba, 1986). A consensual denomination for this poleward flow is\nthe Iberian Poleward Current (IPC). The classic view of the IPC presents it as an upper-\nslope baroclinic current, associated with the downwelling of the isopycnal field in a width\nof about 40 km, and positive temperature and salinity anomalies from the surface down to\ntypically 400 m. It was suggested that poleward flows are not a winter phenomenon only,\nbut are present throughout the year (Peliz et al, 2005; Relvas et al., 2007).\n\nThere is another factor at play in the WIM shelf circulation that originates from fresh-\nwater input from the many rivers along the coast (see Figure 1.2 b), which consists in\nrecurrent lenses of low salinity water in the upper 10-20 m close to the coast, that can\nbe advected offshore. Peliz et al. (2002) have named it Western Iberian Bouyant Plume\n(WIBP) and determined its maximum salinity in 35.7. The WIBP is more evident and\nfrequently wider in winter due to the stronger river discharge in that season. The IPC\nsometimes works as a barrier for the offshore displacement of the WIBP (Santos et al.,\n\n6\n\n\n\n2004). In summer and in the presence of coastal upwelling, the WIBP is advected both\nequatorward and offshore through the Ekman layer (Peliz et al., 2002).\n\n1.3.2 Mediterranean Water Outflow\n\nUpon exiting the 300-m deep Strait of Gibraltar, the dense Mediterranean Water\n(MW) flows downslope within the Gulf of Cadiz until it reaches neutral buoyancy. The\nintermediate-level resulting current is denoted Mediterranean Undercurrent in the Gulf of\nCadiz (Ambar and Howe, 1979a) and Mediterranean Water Vein along the Western Iberian\nPeninsula (Daniault et al., 1994). Here, it flows at mid-depths often in two cores, typically\nat 800 m (the upper core), where a temperature maximum is reached, and at 1200 m\n(the lower core), the depth at which the salinity maximum is found. The signature of the\nhydrographic properties of both cores attenuates (specially the upper core) poleward along\nthe Western Iberian Peninsula. Associated with this flow, there are mesoscale structures\nthat are formed and which are responsible for a relevant part of this water mass properties\ntransport: the Mediterranean eddies (Meddies), anticyclonic vortices with radii of several\ntens of kilometers, occurring typically between 700 m and 1300 m deep (Bower et al.,\n1995). Meddies propagate typically southwestward into the North Atlantic (Richardson et\nal., 2000). MW is further discussed in the following sub-section.\n\n1.3.3 Water Masses\n\nFigure 1.3 shows a typical ?-S diagram for WIM, adapted from Fiu?za et al. (1998). The\nleast dense waters correspond to near-surface waters (?? &lt;26.6), reflecting their strong\nseasonal variability. These waters have temperatures varying between 14oC and more than\n20oC. Salinities lower than 35.7 in the surface water density range are the signature of the\nWIBP.\n\nThe upper limit of the central waters is identified by a salinity maximum found in the\ninterval 26.5 &lt;?? &lt;27, with values varying between 36.0 and 36.2. According to R??os et al.\n(1992), two types of central waters can be identified off Western Iberian Peninsula: Eastern\nNorth Atlantic Central Water of subpolar origin (ENACWsp) and Eastern North Atlantic\nCentral Water of subtropical origin (ENACWst). ENACWsp is related with Subpolar\nMode Water, which forms due to deep convection that occurs during winter north of 46oN\n(McCartney and Talley, 1982). The ENACWst, formed to the north of the Azores Current\nat approximately 35oN, is advected northwestward.\n\nThe basis of the ENACWsp is characterized by a salinity minimum (? 35.6 at the WIM)\nand marks the transition toward the Mediterranean Water (MW). The MW flows through\nthe Gulf of Cadiz and the entire basin with a typical tongue structure, reaching the Bay\nof Biscay as described in the literature and as observed in many available climatologies\n(Reynaud et al., 1998; Iorga and Lozier, 1999; Troupin et al., 2010). Two cores can be\ndistinguished: a less dense (?? ? 27.5-27.6) upper core (MWU), with typical values found\nalong the WIM of ? = 11-12oC and S = 36.1-36.2; and a denser (?? ? 27.8) lower core\n\n7\n\n\n\n(MWL), with a lower temperature (?<11\noC) and a higher salinity (S = 36.3-36.4) (Ambar\n\nand Howe, 1979b).\nThe deeper waters (below MW) are not within the scope of this work, but they influence\n\nthe intermediate levels and hence a brief description follows. The two most important are\nthe Labrador Sea Water (LSW) and the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). The LSW is\ncharacterized by very low salinities (? 34.9) and ? = 3.50oC. These values were measured\nnear the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at about 50oN (Talley and McCartney, 1982). The NADW\nhas higher salinities and lower temperatures than the LSW, and was defined by Saunders\n(1982) as ? = 2.50oC and S = 34.94.\n\nFigure 1.3: Typical ?-S diagram for the Western Iberian Margin (adapted from Fiu?za et\nal., 1998). ? and S values correspond to a climatological dataset described in Fiu?za et al.\n(1998) for the 6 regions showed in the map in the lower right corner of the Figure.\n\n8\n\n\n\n1.4 Regional Modeling\n\n1.4.1 Overview\n\nThe numerical study of the circulation of the WIM is a challenge for modelers, for\nseveral reasons: i) the presence of a narrow shelf and a steep slope, as well as the presence\nof numerous canyons and promontories, requiring high resolution to properly resolve the\nshelf/slope circulation; ii) the presence of a unique oceanographic feature, which is the\nMediterranean outflow, generated at the Strait of Gibraltar and spreading into the north-\neastern Atlantic giving rise to the large scale MW anomaly; iii) the strong influence of the\nopen ocean circulation (the Azores Current system and meridional pressure gradients) on\nthe coastal transition zone, that forces the circulation in this region.\n\nEastern boundary currents, due to their complexity and to the importance in studying\nthe upwelling phenomenon, have been the subject of several regional modeling studies over\nthe past years. The following works are important efforts toward a better knowledge of the\ndynamics of these systems: Marchesiello et al. (2003), concerning the California Current\nSystem; Penven et al. (2005), who focused on the Peru Current System; Veitch et al.\n(2010), with respect to the Benguela Current System; and Mason et al. (2011) for the\nCanary Current System.\n\nIn what concerns numerical modeling regional studies at the full scale of the region,\nsome previous works contributed to the study of this particular circulation. Some of them\nwere carried out at a resolution of about 9 km (Stevens et al., 2000; Coelho et al., 2002) and\nfocused on spring and winter circulation; others were idealized studies at a high resolution\n(R\u00f8ed and Shi, 1999; Peliz et al., 2003a). Batteen et al. (2000, 2007) carried out sensitivity\nstudies in order to assess the different mechanisms controlling the circulation in the region.\nThe study by Serra et al. (2010) resolves the circulation in this region with realistic forcing\nand very high resolution, focusing on the study of the influence of the MW vein on the\nsurface circulation, with emphasis on the mesoscale phenomena. On the other hand, from\nthe point of view of operational oceanography of the Western Iberian Margin, Mateus et\nal (2012) focused on the application of an operational configuration (? 1/16o resolution)\nto discuss its potential for products and services for scientific and coastal management\nactivities. In the neighborhood of the region, and also at a high resolution, Friocourt et al.\n(2007) and Peliz et al. (2007) studied the Bay of Biscay and the Gulf of Cadiz circulation,\nrespectively.\n\nIn this light, the purpose of this work is to carry out a comprehensive study of the entire\nregion, where all the factors that dictate its dynamics are taken into account, including\nriver discharge and the Mediterranean Water flow, all combined to address different aspects\nof the current system.\n\n1.4.2 The Model (Regional Ocean Modelling System \u2014 ROMS)\n\nROMS is a free-surface, terrain following coordinate model, designed to resolve regional\nproblems (Shchepetkin and McWilliams, 2003, 2005). ROMS solves the incompressible\n\n9\n\n\n\nprimitive equations based on the Boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations, and is cou-\npled with advection/diffusion schemes for potential temperature and salinity as well as a\nnonlinear equation of state.\n\nA brief account of the main equations, approximations and parameterizations follows.\n\nThe equation of state (? is the sea water density) depends on temperature (T), salinity\n(S) and pressure (p):\n\n? = ? (T, S, p) (1.3)\n\nThe primitive equations of the ocean state obey the laws of conservation of properties,\nsuch as mass (equation of continuity):\n\nd?\n\ndt\n+ ??.?u = 0 (1.4)\n\nwhere ?u = u ?ex + v ?ey + w ?ez and, through the principle of fluid incompressibility\n(d?/dt = 0), gives:\n\n?.?u = 0 (1.5)\n\nThe conservation of momentum (the equation of motion), based on Netwon\u2019s 2nd law\nof motion (?F = m ?a) is:\n\nd?u\n\ndt\n= ?\n\n?p\n?\n\n? 2?? \u00d7 ?u + ?g + ?F + ?D (1.6)\n\nwhere on the right hand of the equation are (from left to right) the pressure gradi-\nent force, the Coriolis force, gravity, friction and dissipation. Likewise, the equations of\nconservation of heat and salt are, respectively:\n\ndT\n\ndt\n= ?FT + ?DS and\n\ndS\n\ndt\n= ?FS + ?DS (1.7)\n\nThe vertical component is obtained through the hydrostatic approximation, which con-\nsiders that w and ?w/?t are very small in comparison with the horizontal velocities and\ntheir variation in time. Thus, gravity balances the vertical pressure gradient.\n\nThe equations of motion also assume the Boussinesq approximation for geostrophic\ncurrents (that is, when the Coriolis force balances the horizontal pressure gradient), which\nstates that horizontal variations of density are negligible except in the buoyancy term.\nHence, the previous conservation equations can be expressed as:\n\n10\n\n\n\n?u\n\n?t\n= ?u\n\n?u\n\n?x\n? v\n\n?u\n\n?y\n? w\n\n?u\n\n?z\n+ fv ?\n\n1\n\n?\n\n?p\n\n?x\n+ Fu + Du (1.8a)\n\n?v\n\n?t\n= ?u\n\n?u\n\n?y\n? v\n\n?v\n\n?y\n? w\n\n?v\n\n?z\n? fu ?\n\n1\n\n?\n\n?p\n\n?y\n+ Fv + Dv (1.8b)\n\n?p\n\n?z\n= ??g (1.8c)\n\n?T\n\n?t\n= ?u\n\n?T\n\n?x\n? v\n\n?T\n\n?y\n? w\n\n?T\n\n?z\n+ FT + DT (1.8d)\n\n?S\n\n?t\n= ?u\n\n?S\n\n?y\n? v\n\n?S\n\n?y\n? w\n\n?S\n\n?z\n+ FS + DS (1.8e)\n\n0 =\n?u\n\n?x\n+\n\n?v\n\n?y\n+\n\n?w\n\n?z\n(1.8f)\n\nwhere x, y, z are the Cartesian coordinates; u, v, w are the velocity ?u Cartesian compo-\nnents; f is the Coriolis parameter (f = 2? sin(?), where ? is the angular velocity of the\nEarth and ? the latitude; ? = ?0 + ?\u2019 is the sea water density (?0 the average density and\n?\u2019 the perturbation); g the acceleration of gravity.\n\nThe vertical boundary conditions imposed to the model configurations are as follows:\n\nat the top: z = ? ?M\n?u\n\n?z\n= ?x\n\ns\n(1.9a)\n\n?M\n?v\n\n?z\n= ?y\n\ns\n(1.9b)\n\n?T\n?T\n\n?z\n=\n\nQT\n?0Cp\n\n(1.9c)\n\n?S\n?S\n\n?z\n=\n\n(E ?

Taking\nthis into account, a stretching factor is applied to the surface (?s) and to the bottom (?b),\nin order to define where to attribute the best resolution (surface or bottom). If ?s is large,\nthen ? levels are more concentrated in the surface, providing it a finer resolution; if ?b = 1\n(0 &lt;?b &lt;1), then it is the bottom that is enhanced.\n\nDuring the equations discretization process, which is carried out on an Arakawa C grid\n(meaning that u and v are defined on the grid lines and all other variables inside each\ngrid cell), it is necessary to add a bathymetry correction for the slope, as to smooth the\ntransition toward shallower depths. This criterion of stability is defined as:\n\nr =\n?h\n\n2h\n(1.11)\n\nwhere ?h is the depth difference between neighbor cells, h is the local depth.\nThe advection scheme is based on the work done by Marchesiello et al. (2009), in order\n\nto reduce spurious diapycnal mixing in ?-coordinate models characteristic of higher-order\ndiffusive advection schemes. This scheme involves the split of advection and diffusion, as\na biharmonic operator. Lateral viscosity is set to zero, except in the sponge layers, where\nit increases linearly toward the boundaries of the model. Vertical mixing consists in the\nKPP (K-profile parameterization) scheme (Large et al., 1994).\n\nTo this set of equations must be added, to a given configuration, a set of initial and\nboundary conditions, as well as surface forcing, which will be detailed in part in the con-\nfiguration description, and in part throughout the work, because each chapter requires a\ndifferent forcing, depending on the particular study and its objectives.\n\nThe configurations discussed in this work, not only resolve the large-scale circulation\npatterns and their influence on the coastal transition zone of WIM, but also resolve ex-\nplicitly a unique small-scale feature consisting in the Mediterranean outflow through the\nStrait of Gibraltar. Given the different scales that influence the circulation of the WIM,\nranging from the few kilometers of the Strait of Gibraltar dynamics, to the hundreds to\nthousands kilometers scale of the Azores Current system, a simulation based on nesting\ntechniques was performed, as detailed below.\n\nAs a final note, most of the computations, from ROMS data handling to grid interpo-\nlation, were possible through the use of the ROMS tools provided by Penven et al. (2008).\n\n1.4.3 Large Domain\n\nThe strategy to manage a large range of scales consists in the implementation of a two-\ndomain approach. A large-scale first domain (FD \u2014 Figure 1.2 a) is run independently in\norder to provide initial and boundary conditions to our second domain (SD \u2014 Figure 1.2 b)\n\n12\n\n\n\nthrough an offline nesting. The first domain horizontal resolution is 1/10o (? 9 km in\nlongitude), and the main aim for this domain is to resolve the large-scale circulation features\nsuch as the Azores Current, and its interaction with the Atlantic margin of the Iberian\nPeninsula.\n\nFor this domain, 30 sigma vertical levels are used, with a stretching factor of ?s = 7 and\n?b = 0 to conserve a good near-surface resolution over the entire domain. The bathymetry\nis based on ETOPO1 (Amante and Eakins, 2009), with corrections near the slope and a\nsmoothing filter to fulfill the r = ?h/2h criteria (Haidvogel and Beckmann, 1999), r &lt;0.2.\n\nThe World Ocean Atlas 2009 (WOA-2009) climatology is used as the initial value for\nthe temperature (Locarnini et al., 2010) and salinity (Antonov et al., 2010) fields, and\nalso to recycle these fields along the nudging bands, providing open boundary conditions.\nThese open boundary conditions were established by Marchesiello et al. (2001), with inflow\n(outflow) nudging timescales of 1 (360) day(s) for tracers and 10 (360) days for momentum,\nrespectively. Sponge layers are applied along the edges with a band of 120 km, with a\nlateral viscosity coefficient ranging from 600 m2s?1 at the boundary to zero at the interior.\nExplicit viscosity and diffusivity is null, and a linear drag formulation with coefficient\nr = 3 \u00d7 10?4 m s?1 is applied at the bottom.\n\nSurface forcing varies, depending on what is intended from a given ROMS run. Since\nthis work focused on different aspects of the WIM dynamics, in different space and time\nscales, several simulations are carried out, each forced with a different dataset, described in\ndue course. However, the surface forcing computation is similar: initial velocities are zero,\nand monthly geostrophic velocities (with level of reference 1200 m) and Ekman velocities\nare calculated from the dataset and applied along the open boundaries. The Mediterranean\nundercurrent is introduced as a nudging zone, in the interior, as described by Peliz et al.\n(2007), in order to restore the hydrographic properties of the Mediterranean levels.\n\n1.4.4 High-Resolution Domain\n\nThe target domain, SD (stands for second domain, see Figure 1.2) has a horizontal\nresolution of 1/27o (? 3 km in longitude), and includes the Gulf of Cadiz, the WIM, and\npart of the western Bay of Biscay, extending for ? 1300 km in the meridional direction,\nfrom 34oN to 46oN. In the zonal direction, the domain extends from the Strait of Gibraltar,\nlocated at 5.5oW to 12.5oW, representing a width of about 600 km.\n\nSixty sigma vertical levels with ?s = 4 and ?b = 0 are used to properly resolve the\nMediterranean undercurrent with enough near-bottom resolution. In this way, the grid\nhas 60 \u00d7 188 \u00d7 389 cells.\n\nThe topography by Sibuet et al. (2004) was used, which has a resolution of ? 1 km\nand was smoothed in order to fulfill the same r-factor criteria (r &lt;0.2) of the large-scale\ndomain.\n\nThe initialization and the boundary conditions are obtained using one year from FD,\nwith average data stored every 3 days. The choice of the year that provides these conditions\nto SD was based on the kinetic energy (KE), averaged over the entire FD. Year 5 was\nthe year that showed the least fluctuations in KE, and therefore was used as initial and\n\n13\n\n\n\nboundary conditions for SD. An experiment using year 7 of FD showed similar results for\nthe SD run.\n\nAlso, similarly to the large-scale simulation, a nudging sponge layer is introduced. Open\nboundary conditions are the same as for the FD configuration; however the sponge layers\nare applied to a band of 40 km, with a lateral viscosity coefficient ranging from 200 m2s?1\n\nat the boundary to zero at the interior. A quadratic drag coefficient of 5 \u00d7 10?3 is used.\nAt the Strait of Gibraltar, at the southeastern boundary, the water exchange with the\nMediterranean basin is explicitly represented in the domain, with the methodology of Peliz\net al. (2007), consisting in the imposition of vertical profiles of temperature, salinity, and\nzonal velocity at the 5 grid points at the Strait. This condition is designed to setup a\ntransport of 0.8 Sv leaving the domain through the surface layer, and 0.7 Sv entering\nthe domain through the bottom layer. The process of entrainment of Atlantic Central\nWaters with the Mediterranean outflow is also parameterized by increasing the viscosity\nand diffusivity coefficients in a region in which the MW is strongly mixed with the overlying\nAtlantic waters, until the MW vein forms along the northern slope of the Gulf of Cadiz.\n\nThe inflow of freshwater in the ocean, originated from the main rivers of the region\n(white lines in Figure 1.2 b), is included. For the Portuguese rivers, climatological values\nwere provided by INAG (Water Institute of Portugal); the information on the Spanish\nrivers was provided by Barja and Lestega?s (1992).\n\nThe spin-up time for this domain, in which the KE stabilizes, is 5 years, as the adjust-\nment time of the Mediterranean outflow along the western and northern Iberian Margin is\nquite a slow process.\n\nSurface forcings are in agreement with the corresponding large domain configuration\nfor a given run. More information on the configurations is given each chapter / section.\n\n1.5 Outline\n\nTable 1.1 summarizes all the ROMS simulations carried out. Our target domain is SD;\nhence it is the one we focus on most. The numerical approach is always offline nesting,\nwhich means that in all cases there are always two runs carried out: one FD, one SD.\nFurthermore, each run has always the same dataset as initial and boundary conditions:\nthe former WOA09, the latter one year of FD.\n\nRun Surface Forcing Run years Initial &amp; boundary conditions\n\nClimatological COADS (1945-1989) 14\n\nYearly\n\u201cReal\u201d Winds and Fluxes\n(NCEP/QuikSCAT-ASCAT) 11 FD: World Ocean Atlas 2009\n(2001-2011) SD: one year of FD\n\nCGCM present ensemble IPCC (1945-1989) 10\nCGCM future ensemble IPCC (2071-2100) 10\n\nTable 1.1: Summary of all performed ROMS simulations.\n\n14\n\n\n\nThe outline of this work is as follows: chapter 2 presents a climatological study of the\nmean and seasonal dynamics off WIM; chapter 3 addresses the interannual variability of the\nupper ocean circulation for period 2001-2011; for the same period, a larval connectivity and\ndispersal study is carried out in chapter 4; chapter 5 consists in a sensitivity study on the\nability of global climate models to force regional ocean configurations; finally, in chapter 6,\nthis is put to use in a future ocean simulation where possible changes in hydrography and\ndynamics are explored.\n\n15\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nMean and Seasonal Characterization\nof the Upper Ocean off Western\nIberian Margin\n\nThe contents of this chapter have been published by Nolasco et al. (2013a) and Cordeiro\nPires et al. (2013a).\n\n2.1 Overview\n\nThis chapter focuses on the equilibrium circulation of the WIM current system. The\nmain purpose is to characterize the mean seasonal hydrography and the resulting circulation\nin the upper layers of the ocean, including the surface layer, the underlying central waters,\nand the intermediate Mediterranean Water levels. In order to do so, numerical simulations\nwere setup forced by climatological heat and momentum fluxes, that is, the circulation\nis dictated by the intrinsic variability of the model, and in the absence of any external\ninterannual atmospheric or oceanic forcing.\n\nThe study will particularly aim at an integrated discussion of the three main dynamical\nphenomena of WIM: coastal upwelling, poleward flow (IPC) and Mediterranean Water\noutflow, which, although independent, are intimately linked. Although the region dynamics\nis strongly seasonal, the question of the prevalence of poleward flow throughout the year\nis addressed, based also on observational studies, as well as the generation of vorticity\nstructures of the mean flow along the WIM.\n\nFurthermore, in this chapter, a Lagrangian study is carried out, with the purpose of\nevaluating the origin of the waters that are upwelled along the WIM, from a climatolog-\nical point of view. Studying the origin of upwelled waters in an upwelling system may\nbe useful for several purposes: providing scales of dispersion in the marine environment,\nregarding biological issues (e.g. larval dispersal lengths or fisheries) or pollution studies;\nstudying connectivity between marine populations (further carried out in chapter 4); in-\ndicating climate variability; amongst others.

In\nthis way, one is able to follow the 3D trajectories, and even hydrographic and dynamical\nproperties, allowing studies of a diverse nature to be carried out (e.g. Domingues et al.,\n2012). Chhak and Di Lorenzo (2007) found that during the warm/cold phase of the Pa-\ncific Decadal Oscillation upwelled waters at the California upwelling system originated at\nshallower/deeper levels. Blanke et al. (2009) were able to study the variability of water\ntransfers between the adjacent regions of the Benguela upwelling system, which strongly\ninfluence the spawning of anchovies. Albert et al. (2010) showed, through the same means,\n\n18\n\n\n\nthat the distance and depth of origin of the particles surfacing at the Humboldt upwelling\nsystem were dependent on the coastal wind stress curl. At the North American western\ncoast, the origin of upwelled waters off Oregon was addressed by Rivas and Samelson (2011)\nthrough numerical modeling, who found that the waters that upwell there could come from\nalongshore northern locations or from offshore sites to the west, mostly from depths greater\nthan 100 m, although the sources depended strongly on the region and the tendency to\ngenerate mesoscale features.\n\nThe chapter is organized as such: after a description of the data and the method-\nology (section 2.2), a brief validation of FD is carried out (section 2.3), followed by an\nhydrographic validation of the high-resolution domain, SD (section 2.4). Then, the mean\nflow vertical and horizontal structure is analyzed in detail (section 2.5), and the final sec-\ntion addresses the Lagrangian study carried out over the same climatological ROMS run\n(section 2.6).\n\n2.2 Data and Methodology\n\n2.2.1 Model Configurations\n\nSurface fluxes are provided by the Comprehensive Ocean and Atmosphere Data Set\n(COADS). COADS has been, by excellence, the used climatology for such regional ocean\nmodeling studies (e.g. Marchesiello et al. 2001). This COADS version is an enhanced cli-\nmatology originated from a joint effort of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM)\nand the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC \u2014 http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/)\n(da Silva et al. 1994) which resulted in an optimized COADS for the period 1945-1989 cli-\nmatology for both atmosphere and ocean, with an improved resolution of 0.5o\u00d70.5o (except\nsea surface salinity, which has a resolution of 1o \u00d71o). This is a monthly mean climatology\nwithout interannual variability comprised by heat fluxes (shortwave, longwave and latent),\nwater fluxes (evaporation minus precipitation), wind stress, sea surface temperature (SST),\nand sea surface salinity (SSS).\n\nThe absence of an ocean-atmosphere feedback term can lead to model SST drift. This\nproblem is addressed in ROMS by an air-sea feedback parameterization that is added to\nthe surface flux (Veitch et al. 2010). This is done using the COADS SST distribution, and\na similar correction scheme is used for SSS.\n\n2.2.2 Climatology\n\nThe first part of the model output analysis is a comparison with climatological data.\nTwo datasets were chosen to carry out this comparison: the recent climatological GHER\natlas for the Northeast Atlantic (Troupin et al., 2010) (hereafter GHER-NEA climatology)\nand satellite products. The GHER-NEA climatology was chosen for its high resolution\n(0.1o), which properly resolves the slope and shelf regions unlike most available climatolo-\ngies, and both temperature and salinity are compared to model results.\n\n19\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Satellite Products\n\nFor the sea surface temperature (SST), the comparison is carried out with data from the\nAdvanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) of the National Oceanic and Atmo-\nspheric Administration (NOAA). The data was extracted from the EUMETSAT Ocean &amp;\nSea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI-SAF) (www.osi-saf.org) and was made available\nby CERSAT (IFREMER, France). The product has an approximate resolution of 2 km.\nThe final data consists in 7-year averages, corresponding to years 2002 to 2008, for January\nand July, of the night satellite sweep (hereafter satellite climatology).\n\n2.2.4 Altimetry Products\n\nThe altimetry data were retrieved from the AVISO (Archiving, Validation and In-\nterpretation of Satellite Oceanographic data) website (http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/).\nThe altimeter products were made available by Ssalto/Duacs (Segment Sol multimissions\nd\u2019ALTime?trie, d\u2019Orbitographie et de localisation pre?cise / Data unification and altimetry\ncombination system), with support from Cnes (French national center for space studies).\nSsalto/Duacs system processes data from all altimeter missions (Jason-1&amp;2, T/P, Envisat,\nGFO, ERS-1 &amp; 2 and Geosat) to provide a consistent and homogeneous catalog of products\nfor varied applications, both for near real time applications and offline studies. Altimetry\nweekly data was obtained from AVISO for the period October 1992 to July 2011.\n\n2.3 Large Domain Validation\n\nThe FD domain was designed to solve the large-scale circulation in order to provide\nboundary conditions to the target domain SD. It is not intended to discuss the circulation\nresulting from this domain, but to show an example of how the large-scale circulation is\nsolved for this domain. For that purpose, an Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE) comparison\nbetween altimetry and FD output is done in Figure 2.2. The signature of the Azores\nCurrent is clear between 33oN and 36oN, and the signal extends east to ? 12oW in both.\nThere is also evidence of the North Atlantic Current at the northwestern corner of the FD\ndomain. In terms of magnitude, EKE is more intense in ROMS for the Azores Current,\nand more intense in AVISO for the North Atlantic Current. Nevertheless, the comparison\nis acceptable and hence FD is reproducing well the regional dynamics energetically.\n\n2.4 High-Resolution Domain Validation\n\nThe WIM hydrography resulting from the model solutions is analyzed by comparing the\nmodeled horizontal and vertical temperature and salinity distributions with the GHER-\nNEA climatological data described above, with the exception of SST, which is compared\nto satellite data. Therefore, both SD and climatology temperature and salinity fields are\nrepresented through mean seasonal surface fields, ?-S diagrams and zonal vertical sections.\n\n20\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  30oW   24oW   18oW   12oW    6 oW \n\n  33oN \n\n  36oN \n\n  39oN \n\n  42oN \n\n  45oN \n\nEKE AVISO (c m2/s2)\n\n \n\n \n\n  30oW   24oW   18oW   12oW    6 oW \n\n  33oN \n\n  36oN \n\n  39oN \n\n  42oN \n\n  45oN \n\nEKE ROMS (c\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nm2/s2)\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nFigure 2.2: Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE, cm2 s?2) annual average for (a) altimetry data,\nand (b) FD model results.\n\n21\n\n\n\n2.4.1 Surface Fields\n\nFigure 2.3 presents the January mean sea surface temperature (SST) (upper row) and\nsalinity (SSS) (lower row) of both SD and the corresponding climatology, as well as the\ndifference between the modeled and the climatological fields. Figure 2.4 is the correspond-\ning image for the month of July.\n\na. Winter\nDuring winter (Figure 2.3), both SD and the climatologies show the existence of a\n\nmeridional gradient of sea surface temperature and salinity. A tongue of saltier and warmer\nwater centered at approximately 9.5oW-10oW is also observed, which is associated with the\npoleward advection of waters with subtropical origin, frequently referred to in the literature\nas the Iberian Poleward Current (IPC) (A?lvarez-Salgado et al., 2003). Although this tongue\nis visible in both SST and SSS, it is less evident in the SST satellite field. Moreover, the\npoleward penetration of the climatological tongue reaches farther north than the SD one,\ncausing a difference of about -0.1 in salinity between 39oN and 42oN.\n\nAlong the continental shelf, north of the Estremadura Promontory, a band of buoyant\nfresher and colder waters is observed in the SST and SSS climatologies, as well as in the\nSD averages. This band is associated with the presence of winter river inflow along the\nwestern coast, mainly contributed to by Tagus, Mondego, Douro, Minho and the Galician\nRias rivers (see Figure 1.2 b). This fresh water signature lingers over the continental shelf,\ngenerating the Western Iberian Buoyant Plume (WIBP) (Peliz et al., 2002; Otero et al.,\n2008), that can reach as far as 40 km offshore.\n\nb. Summer\nDuring summer (Figure 2.4), the most important phenomenon observed is coastal up-\n\nwelling induced by the predominant equatorward winds along the WIM, which results in\nthe presence of a coastal band of cold and fresh waters. From north to south, both the\nSD (Figure 2.4 a,d) and the climatological (Figure 2.4 b,e) offshore temperature (salinity)\nfields increase from 18oC (35.7) in the northern region to 22oC (36.4) in the Gulf of Cadiz.\nMoreover, the offshore isotherms and isohalines bend southward encompassing the pres-\nence of the coastal band of upwelled water from the southern coast of Portugal up to Cape\nOrtegal, the northern tip of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nThus, the main patterns of the July average temperature and salinity for the offshore\nregion are well reproduced in SD, resulting in low temperature and salinity differences\n(Figure 2.4 c,f). However, SD tends to overestimate the intensity of upwelling, presenting\na coastal water band that is colder than the satellite climatology. As discussed by Veitch et\nal. (2010), and references herein, the climatological winds do not account for the drop-off\nof the wind stress in the neighborhood of the coast.\n\nThere are also regions in which SD, on the contrary, overestimates the surface temper-\nature. Along the Galician coast, north of Cape Finisterre, unlike SD results, filaments are\n\n22\n\n\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n  36\no\nN \n\n  38\no\nN \n\n  40\no\nN \n\n  42\no\nN \n\n  44\no\nN \n\na)\n\n      \n\n \nb)\n\n      \n\n  36\no\nN \n\n  38\no\nN \n\n  40\no\nN \n\n  42\no\nN \n\n  44\no\nN \n\nc)\n\n  12\no\nW   10\n\no\nW    8\n\no\nW     6  W \n\no\n\n  36\no\nN \n\n  38\no\nN \n\n  40\no\nN \n\n  42\no\nN \n\n  44\no\nN \n\nf)\n\n35.4\n\n35.6\n\n35.8\n\n36\n\n36.2\n\n36.4\n\n36.6\n\n  12\no\nW   10\n\no\nW    8\n\no\nW    6\n\no\nW \n\n  36\no\nN \n\n  38\no\nN \n\n  40\no\nN \n\n  42\no\nN \n\n  44\no\nN \n\nd)\n\n  12\no\nW   10\n\no\nW    8\n\no\nW    6\n\no\nW \n\n \n\n \ne)\n\n!3\n\n!2\n\n!1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n!0.3\n\n!0.2\n\n!0.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n \n\nFigure 2.3: SST in oC (upper row) and SSS (lower row) for January.

These regions\nare influenced by the gap winds, which consist in strong easterly winds associated with\npressure differences between both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar (Peliz et al, 2009), not\nrepresented in the climatological winds.\n\nThe summer SSS field (Figure 2.4 d) is characterized by the upwelling of Eastern North\nAtlantic Central Waters with northern origin (ENACWsp), which are advected southward.\nThis upwelled water has a typical salinity signature of about 35.8. Underlying the upwelled\nCentral Water, there is a low salinity surface water (lower than 35.7) observed in the\nGHER-NEA climatology (Figure 2.4 e), which is associated with the remnant of the WIBP\nadvected offshore by Ekman transport, giving rise to a low salinity plume at the surface.\nThis band of fresher water is not well resolved by SD, and accounts for the major differences\nbetween model and the GHER-NEA climatology (Figure 2.4 f). The reason for this is\nthat COADS winds are almost constant during summer, which promotes, through Ekman\ntransport, the offshore dispersal of the WIBP and its dilution, while in nature, in the\npresence of variable winds, the plume remains trapped to the coastal region. On the other\nhand, in the remaining places, the salinity differences are mostly within \u00b10.1 between SD\nand the climatology.\n\n2.4.2 Water Masses\n\nTo compare the SD water mass properties with the climatological values, ?-S diagrams\nwere elaborated for two regions (boxes with 1o of length and width) centered at 10oW and\nlatitudes 38oN and 42oN (see Figure 2.1 for location). These diagrams are displayed in\nFigure 2.5. For each box, monthly (January, April, July and October) mean profiles of po-\ntential temperature and salinity were calculated from years 10 to 14 of the simulation (one\ndashed line per year, in order to show the interannual variability), and are superimposed\nto the GHER-NEA climatology (solid line).\n\nThe seasonal evolution of the thermohaline properties of the central and surface waters\nis reasonably well reproduced by SD when compared with the climatological values. Con-\ncerning the Central Water properties of both SD and climatology, by comparison with the\nstandard straight lines in the ?-S space for ENACWst and ENACWsp, it is clear that the\nnorthern (southern) region is more influenced by the presence of the subpolar (subtropical)\nbranch of the ENACW.\n\nFor the southern region, in January (Figure 2.5 a), the Central Waters have their\nthermohaline properties superimposed with the ENACWst line, typical of the waters that\ngive origin to the IPC. Below the surface, salinity decreases linearly to a minimum of 35.7,\nnear the 27.1 isopycnal, and increases downward due to the influence of the underlying MW\nmass, up to a maximum of 36.2 on the 27.6 isopycnal, which is about 0.15 lower than the\nclimatological value. In April (Figure 2.5 b), a decrease of the surface salinity maximum is\nobserved, associated with the start of the upwelling season. During summer (Figure 2.5 c),\nthe seasonal heating modifies the ?-S structure at the surface, by increasing the temperature\n\n25\n\n\n\n35.5 36 36.5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\nJan\n\n28\n\n27\n26\n\n35.5 36 36.5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\nApr\n\n28\n\n27\n26\n\n35.5 36 36.5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\nJul\n\n28\n\n27\n26\n\n35.5 36 36.5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\nOct\n\n28\n\n26\n\n27\n\n35.5 36 36.5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n28\n\n27\n26\n\n35.5 36 36.5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n28\n\n27\n26\n\n35.5 36 36.5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n28\n\n26\n\n27\n\n35.5 36 36.5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n28\n\n27\n\n26\n\nFigure 5 \u2013 !-S diagrams monthly means of ROMS output (dashed lines, \none per year, for years 10 to 14) and GHER-NEA climatology (solid line) \nfor January (a, e), April (b, f), July (c, g) and October (d, h) for two regions: \none centered at 38\u00baN, 10\u00baW (a-d), the other centered at 42\u00baN, 10\u00baW (e-h). \nPotential  density anomaly (\"!) is superimposed in pointed lines every \n0.2kg m-3; the shaded line corresponds to the standard definitions of \nENACWst and ENACWsp, defined as !=10+8.462*(S-35.4) for the subpolar \nbranch (34.8<S<35.7) and !=13.13+5.653*(S-35.8) for the subtropical branch \n(35.8<S<36.2), as defined by Fi\u00faza [1984].\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nd)\n\ne)\n\nf)\n\ng)\n\nh)\n\n! \n(\u00ba\nC)\n\n! \n(\u00ba\nC)\n\n! \n(\u00ba\nC)\n\n! \n(\u00ba\nC)\n\nS S\n\nS S\n\nS S\n\n! \n(\u00ba\nC)\n\nS S\n\n! \n(\u00ba\nC)\n\n! \n(\u00ba\nC)\n\n! \n(\u00ba\nC)\n\nFigure 2.5: ?-S diagrams of 5-year monthly means of ROMS output (dashed lines) and\nGHER-NEA climatology (solid line) for January (a,e), April (b,f), July (c,g) and October\n(d,h) for two regions: one centered at 38oN, 10oW (a-d), the other centered at 42oN, 10oW\n(e-h).

There is also interannual variability of the temperature at the surface\nlayers. The SD MW mass is fairly well reproduced, ranging from 36.2 to 36.35, which\nincludes the climatological value. In October (Figure 2.5 d), after the upwelling season,\nthe signature of saltier surface waters associated with the IPC is visible both in the SD\nand the climatology, although SD underestimates the surface salinity by about -0.1 units,\nand presents this same difference in respect to the MW mass.\n\nRegarding the northern region (centered at 42oN, 10oW, Figure 2.5 e-h), the seasonal\nevolution of the ?-S field follows a similar pattern to that described for the southern region,\nsince the main differences are observed in the salinity field at the surface levels, with lower\nmaximum values of salinity in both winter and summer. At the MW levels, the salinity\nsignature decreases poleward as expected.\n\nOverall, the SD configuration not only follows the seasonal cycle of temperature and\nsalinity for the surface and central waters, but also reproduces the MW hydrographic\nproperties, although some negative biases are observed (as well as in the MW core depths,\nas discussed later).\n\n2.4.3 Vertical Structure\n\nAs a complementary analysis of the water masses in the two regions discussed above, we\nintend to study the vertical distribution of the hydrographic properties, and to compare\nthe modeled values with the GHER-NEA climatology. The aim is to show and discuss\nthe modeled temperature and salinity fields and to compare them to climatological values\nacross two latitudes, 42oN and 38oN, representative of the northern and southern WIM,\nrespectively. Additionally, a meridional section of temperature and salinity off WIM con-\ncludes the winter hydrography characterization. The averages for SD were computed for\nJanuary and July of simulation years 10 to 14, down to 1500 m in depth.\n\na. Winter Hydrography\nAt 42oN (Figure 2.6 a,c), the winter distribution of temperature and salinity shows a\n\ngeneral downward sloping of the isohalines in the upper slope region (down to about 400 m),\nbetween 9.5oW and 11oW. This downward tendency is associated with the presence of the\nIPC during wintertime, with salinities higher than 35.9 and temperatures around 14.5o.\nThe SD IPC (Figure 2.6 a) shows evidence of this poleward advection at the surface; how-\never, there is a bias of about -1oC in temperature and -0.1 in salinity. On the other hand,\nthe salinity minimum of ENACWsp of 35.65 (see Figure 2.5 e) is reached at depths around\n400 m, shallower than the climatological minimum (450 m). Below that depth lies the MW\nand thus the salinity field increases accordingly to 36 near the slope at an approximate\ndepth of 900 m, which is -0.1 fresher and 100 m shallower than the climatological value.\n\nFor the southern latitude, 38oN (Figure 2.6 b,d), the surface layers are characterized\nby the presence of saltier and warmer waters when compared to the northern section.

Sections are down to 1500 m\nand the first 200 m are enlarged. Temperature is represented in black contours every\n0.5oC in the upper layers and every 1oC in the deeper layers. Salinity is depicted in white\ncontours every 0.1 and shades of gray for specific values: MW (35.9 to 36.3) is represented\nin light gray and ENACW (35.5 to 35.7) is represented in dark gray. Bathymetry is colored\nin black.\n\n29\n\n\n\nENACW, the SD temperature maximum (? 12oC) does not reach as far offshore as the\nclimatological one (extending to 10.5oW whereas in SD the isotherm is close to the slope),\nbut the depth at which they are found (800 m) is the same. On the other hand, the lower\ncore SD MW salinity maximum, 36.2, is underestimated (-0.1), as is the depth at which\nthis maximum is found (about 1000 m in SD and 1200 m in the climatology). Below the\nMW, the transition to LSW in SD is located at lower depths than the climatological value.\n\nThe upper levels meridional distribution of the temperature and salinity fields along\nthe WIM at 11.5oW (Figure 2.7) shows evidence of a large-scale gradient with southern\nwarmer and saltier waters of subtropical origins and northern colder and fresher waters of\nsubpolar origins. A frontal region, frequently observed between 38 and 40oN and denoted\nby Western Iberia Winter Front (Peliz et al., 2005) separates both regions.\n\nThis meridional density gradient is partly at the origin of the Iberian Poleward current\nsystem (Peliz et al., 2003). A proper representation of the meridional distribution of hy-\ndrographic fields is needed to obtain a realistic poleward current system along the WIM.\nHere, we observe similar meridional gradients of temperature and salinity in the upper\nlevels (0-200 m), although ROMS presents lower salinities north of 43oN and south of 37oN\n(roughly differences of -0.1) and lower temperatures of about -0.5oC to the north reaching\n1oC to the south. At depth, both the ENACW and the MW signatures are clearly ob-\nserved, the former at 400-600 m with typical salinities of 35.6- 35.7 and the latter centered\nat 1000-1200 m with maximum salinities of 35.2-35.3 and a temperature of 11oC.\n\nb. Summer Hydrography\nSimilarly to the winter situation, the summer vertical structure is analyzed for zonal\n\nsections at 42oN and 38oN. At the northern section (Figure 2.8 a,c) the summer circulation\nis well characterized by the presence of coastal upwelling, which affects clearly the near-\nsurface temperature field distribution on the continental shelf. The isotherms warmer than\n14oC outcrop on the shelf, generating a front in the numerical configuration. Note that\nthe GHER-NEA climatology shows evidence of upwelling, although the frontal structure\nis smoothed, as expected from an observational climatological dataset.\n\nThe upwelling of the isothermal field extends down to the 13oC isotherm at approxi-\nmately 200 m in both SD and climatology. At the surface layers summer salinity is lower\nthan during winter because the signature of ENACWst is not observed, as the upwelled\nwaters have a northern origin. A minimum of salinity is nevertheless observed, similarly\nto winter, with the 35.6 isohaline located at approximately 400 m.\n\nConcerning the MW distribution in July, at 42oN there are no significant differences\nwith respect to wintertime in the climatology: the same salinity maximum at approximately\n1000 m, enclosed by the 35.9 isohalines between 700-800 m and 1200-1300 m. In SD, the\nMW vein seems to be squeezed and the temperature field is upwelled by about 100 m with\nrespect to the winter equilibrium depth, as observed by Garcia-Lafuente et al. (2008), who\nrelated the shallowing of the MW vein with its mesoscale field, and whose origin may be\nrelated with the variability of the wind field.\n\nThe southern section, 38oN (Figure 2.8 b,d), is also affected by upwelling during sum-\n\n30\n\n\n\n42\no\nN, ROMS, Jul\n\n35.7\n\n1916\n14\n\n13\n\n15\n18\n\n!200\n\n!150\n\n!100\n\n!50\n\n0\n\nlongitude (\u00ba)\n\nd\nep\n\nth\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n35.7\n\n3\n5\n.6\n\n35.6\n\n36\n\n35.935.9\n\n35.7\n35.6\n\n35.5\n\n11\n\n10\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n!12 !11 !10 !9\n\n!1400\n\n!1200\n\n!1000\n\n!800\n\n!600\n\n!400\n\n42\no\nN, GHER-NEA, Jul\n\n35.7\n\n35\n.7\n\n18\n17\n\n16\n15\n\n14\n\n13\n\n!200\n\n!150\n\n!100\n\n!50\n\n0\n\nlongitude (\u00ba)\n\nd\nep\n\nth\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n35.6\n\n35.6\n35.7\n\n36\n\n36.\n1\n\n35.9\n\n35.6\n\n12\n\n11\n\n11\n\n10\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n!12 !11 !10 !9\n\n!1400\n\n!1200\n\n!1000\n\n!800\n\n!600\n\n!400\n\n38\no\nN, ROMS, Jul\n\n36\n\n35\n.9\n\n36.117\n19\n\n15\n16\n\n14\n\n13\n\n!200\n\n!150\n\n!100\n\n!50\n\n0\n\nlongitude (\u00ba)\n\nd\nep\n\nth\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n3\n6\n.3\n\n36.2\n\n36.1\n36\n35.9\n\n35.7\n\n36\n\n35.7\n\n36.2\n\n12\n\n12\n\n11\n\n10\n\n9\n\n8\n\n!12 !11 !10 !9\n\n!1400\n\n!1200\n\n!1000\n\n!800\n\n!600\n\n!400\n\n38\no\nN, GHER-NEA, Jul\n\n36\n\n35.9\n\n19 18\n\n16\n15\n\n14\n\n17\n\n!200\n\n!150\n\n!100\n\n!50\n\n0\n\nlongitude (\u00ba)\n\nd\nep\n\nth\n (\n\nm\n)\n\n35.7\n\n35.7\n\n35.9\n36\n\n36.2\n\n36.3\n\n36.1\n\n35 9\n\n12\n\n13\n\n11\n\n10\n\n9\n\n12\n\n \n\n \n\n!12 !11 !10 !9\n\n!1400\n\n!1200\n\n!1000\n\n!800\n\n!600\n\n!400\n\n35.4\n\n35.5\n\n35.6\n\n35.7\n\n35.8\n\n35.9\n\n36\n\n36.1\n\n36.2\n\n36.3\n\na) b)\n\nc) d)\n\nFigure 2.8: Same as Figure 2.6 but for July, except temperature in the upper layers is\nrepresented in black contours every 1oC.\n\n31\n\n\n\nmer. In this case the outcropped isotherm is 15oC in SD against 17.5oC in the climatology.\nAt the levels of the MW vein, the main difference between SD and climatology is the 200 m\ndepth difference in the location of the salinity maximum, whereas SD reaches the same\nclimatological maximum of 36.3.\n\n2.5 Mean Flow Structure\n\nThe main focus of this section is the analysis of the circulation in the WIM resulting\nfrom the process of adjustment of the hydrographic fields. Horizontal slices at 50 m and\n1000 m depth showing monthly means for years 10 to 14 of the SD run of the salinity and\nvelocity fields for January and July are displayed in Figure 2.9. In addition, vertical slices\nof the alongshore circulation at northern (43oN), central (40oN) and southern (37.5oN)\nlocations of the WIM are displayed in Figure 2.10, also for January and July monthly\nmeans. Finally, the computation of meridional transport across these same three zonal\nsections were also carried out.\n\n2.5.1 Winter Circulation\n\nOne of the main dynamical features at the western Gulf of Cadiz is the presence of a\npermanent cyclonic circulation (C1 in Figure 2.9 b), which is part of the usually referred\nto as topographic ?-plume circulation (Kida et al., 2008). Lamas et al. (2010) provided\nobservational evidence of the structure. This cyclonic vortex is stronger at the surface, but\nhas a clear signature in depth as well (Figure 2.9 a,b).\n\nThe circulation in the WIM is conditioned by the entrance of the MW vein at the\ngateway between Cape St Vincent and the Gorringe Bank; furthermore, along its path\naround the WIM, the current sometimes becomes unstable and separates from the slope\nat different locations, generating successive anticyclonic structures (Meddies) (Zenk and\nArmi, 1990). As a consequence of the process of spreading of the MW vein, when the flow\nturns to the Tagus Basin, the resulting mean flow is observed to generate mean vorticity\nstructures, two of them (anticyclonic and cyclonic) trapped to the slope, denoted A1 and\nC2 in Figure 2.9 b, and an anticyclonic mean structure offshore, denoted by A2. This\ncomplex recirculation system is also evident in Figure 2.10 e. In the northern side of the\nEstremadura Promontory the flow progresses poleward, giving rise to a partial detachment\nand an anticyclonic structure, denoted A3, which extend from the MW levels up to the\nsurface (Figures 2.9 b and 2.10 c).\n\nEvidences in the literature of this conspicuous negative vorticity in this region are\ndiscussed by Daniault et al. (1994) and Maze? et al. (1997). On the other hand, a region\nof anticyclonic vorticity is frequently observed near 40oN in the SST field, separating the\nsouthern waters (warmer and saltier) that progress poleward from the northern waters\n(fresher and colder). Furthermore, a detailed discussion of this anticyclonic region in the\nframework of the dynamics of the IPC is presented by Peliz et al. (2003a, 2005).\n\n32\n\n\n\n0.25 ms\n!1\n\n  12\no\nW   10\n\no\nW    8\n\no\nW    6\n\no\nW \n\n  35\no\nN \n\n  37\no\nN \n\n  39\no\nN \n\n  41\no\nN \n\n  43\no\nN \n\n  45\no\nN \n\n \n\n \n\n!50m  Jul\n\n0.25 ms\n!1\n\n  12\no\nW   10\n\no\nW    8\n\no\nW    6\n\no\nW \n\n  35\no\nN \n\n  37\no\nN \n\n  39\no\nN \n\n  41\no\nN \n\n  43\no\nN \n\n  45\no\nN \n\n \n\n \n\n!1000m  Jul\n\n35.6 36 36.4\n\n0.25 ms\n!1\n\n  12\no\nW   10\n\no\nW    8\n\no\nW    6\n\no\nW \n\n  35\no\nN \n\n  37\no\nN \n\n  39\no\nN \n\n  41\no\nN \n\n  43\no\nN \n\n  45\no\nN \n\n \n\n \n\n!50m  Jan\n\n0.25 ms\n!1\n\n  12\no\nW   10\n\no\nW    8\n\no\nW    6\n\no\nW \n\n  35\no\nN \n\n  37\no\nN \n\n  39\no\nN \n\n  41\no\nN \n\n  43\no\nN \n\n  45\no\nN \n\n \n\n \n\n!1000m  Jan\n\nA3\n\nC2\n\nA2\n\nA1 C1\n\na) b)\n\nc) d)\n\nFigure 2.9: Salinity and velocity fields for January (a,b) and July (c,d) at 50 m (a,c) and\nat 1000 m (b,d).

From top to bottom, the latitudes are: 43oN (a,d), 40oN (b,e) and 37.5oN\n(c,f). ?? is depicted every 0.2 kg m\n\n?3. The light shades of gray mark negative values\nbelow -0.02 m s?1 and the dark shades of gray positive values above 0.02 m s?1. The thick\ncontour is zero and the first 200 m are enlarged.\n\n34\n\n\n\nNorth of 40oN, a flow bifurcation is observed (Figure 2.9 b). Part of the flow veers cy-\nclonically and becomes part of a northwestward flow that leaves the domain at 42oN, 12oW\nsouth of the Galicia Bank; the other part of the flow reattaches to the slope and continues\npoleward, flowing along Cape Finisterre at 43oN. At this latitude (Figure 2.10 a), this\npoleward flow is associated with a downward slope of the isopycnal field centered at about\n10oW and extending upward from the levels of the MW up to the surface, while offshore\nof 10oW a weak equatorward flow is dominant.\n\nThe 43oN section in the work of Maze? et al. (1997) shows similar circulation, with\nmaximum poleward tendency at ? 9.75oW, and equatorward flow from 10.5oW to 12oW,\nwhich is attributed in part to the recirculation around the Galicia Bank.\n\nThe circulation at 50 m (Figure 2.9 a) shows similar patterns to those at 1000 m,\nshowing coupling between the MW and the surface layers as further discussed below.\n\n2.5.2 Summer Circulation\n\nThe summer circulation at the MW levels (Figure 2.9 d) presents a similar general\nbehavior to that of winter, discussed above. The inflow in the Tagus Basin occurs more\ntrapped to the slope than in January, with less evidence of southward recirculation (A1 in\nFigure 2.9 b) and stronger poleward flow between 9.5oW and 10.5oW. Offshore (10.5oW to\n12oW) there is a weakening of both poleward and equatorward signatures (Figure 2.10 f).\n\nThe anticyclonic structure centered at 40oN, 11oW presents a weaker signature than\nthe one observed in winter, meaning less tendency to detach from the northern flank of the\nEstremadura Promontory, and hence stronger slope-trapped flow at the levels of the MW,\nwith maximum poleward flow at 1200 m depth (Figure 2.10 d).\n\nNorth of this latitude, a weaker flow separation tendency south of the Galicia Bank\nis observed, when compared to the winter case. The tendency for the slope-trapping of\nthe MW vein observed at 40oN during summer is further confirmed at the 43oN section\n(Figure 2.10 b), in which the maximum poleward velocity is 10 cm s?1 at 1000 m depth and\nextending up to the surface with some vertical tilting in the poleward flow structure. One\nof the most striking features in our modeled mean circulation for summer is the existence\nof conspicuous poleward flow during this season. This issue will be further discussed below.\nConcerning the surface layers circulation (Figure 2.9 c), a band of equatorward flow along\nthe continental shelf/upper slope is observed associated with the upwelling front, with\nparticular notice to the velocities between Cape Ortegal and Cape Finisterre, replacing\npart of the northward branch of the poleward flow in winter.\n\n2.5.3 Meridional Transport\n\nIn order to obtain some insights about the seasonal and interannual variability of the\ncirculation, series of alongshore transport were computed across the same three zonal\nsections (43oN, 40oN and 37.5oN) and integrated in the upper 1500 m depth range. As\nvisible in Figure 2.10, there is strong coupling between the circulation at the levels of MW\nand those of the central waters, as documented by Maze? et al. (1997).\n\n35\n\n\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n3\n\n1\n4\n\n1\n5\n\n!\n2\n0\n\n!\n1\n5\n\n!\n1\n0\n\n!\n5051\n0\n\n1\n5\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n2\n\u00baW\n\n t\no\n 1\n\n0\n.3\n\n\u00baW\n\nQy (Sv)\n\ny\nea\n\nrs\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n3\n\n1\n4\n\n1\n5\n\n!1\n0\n\n!5051\n0\n\n1\n0\n.3\n\n\u00baW\n t\n\no\n 9\n\n.6\n\u00baW\n\nQy (Sv)\n\ny\nea\n\nrs\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n3\n\n1\n4\n\n1\n5\n\n!1\n\n!0\n.50\n\n0\n.51\n\n9\n.6\n\n\u00baW\n t\n\no\n 8\n\n.5\n\u00baW\n\nQy (Sv)\n\n!1\n2\n\n!1\n1\n\n!1\n0\n\n!9\n!\n\n1\n5\n0\n0\n\n!\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n!5\n0\n00\n\n4\n3\n\n\u00baN\n; \n\nb\no\nx\nes\n\n o\nf \n\ntr\nan\n\nsp\no\nrt\n\n c\no\nm\n\np\nu\nta\n\nti\no\nn\n\ndepth (m)\n\nlo\nn\ng\nit\n\nu\nd\ne \n\n(\u00ba\n)\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n3\n\n1\n4\n\n1\n5\n\n!2\n0\n\n!1\n5\n\n!1\n0\n\n!5051\n0\n\n1\n5\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n2\n\u00baW\n\n t\no\n 1\n\n0\n.1\n\n\u00baW\nQy (Sv)\n\ny\nea\n\nrs\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n3\n\n1\n4\n\n1\n5\n\n!1\n0\n\n!5051\n0\n\n1\n0\n.1\n\n\u00baW\n t\n\no\n 9\n\n.6\n\u00baW\n\nQy (Sv)\n\ny\nea\n\nrs\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n3\n\n1\n4\n\n1\n5\n\n!1\n\n!0\n.50\n\n0\n.51\n\n9\n.6\n\n\u00baW\n t\n\no\n 8\n\n.5\n\u00baW\n\nQy (Sv)\n\n!1\n2\n\n!1\n1\n\n!1\n0\n\n!9\n!\n\n1\n5\n0\n0\n\n!\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n!\n5\n0\n00\n\n4\n0\n\n\u00baN\n; \n\nb\no\nx\nes\n\n o\nf \n\ntr\nan\n\nsp\no\nrt\n\n c\no\nm\n\np\nu\nta\n\nti\no\nn\n\ndepth (m)\n\nlo\nn\ng\nit\n\nu\nd\ne \n\n(\u00ba\n)\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n3\n\n1\n4\n\n1\n5\n\n!2\n0\n\n!1\n5\n\n!1\n0\n\n!5051\n0\n\n1\n5\n\n2\n0\n\nQy (Sv)\n\ny\nea\n\nrs\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n3\n\n1\n4\n\n1\n5\n\n!1\n0\n\n!5051\n0\n\n1\n0\n.4\n\n\u00baW\n t\n\no\n 9\n\n.2\n\u00baW\n\nQy (Sv)\n\ny\nea\n\nrs\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n3\n\n1\n4\n\n1\n5\n\n!1\n\n!0\n.50\n\n0\n.51\n\n9\n.2\n\n\u00baW\n t\n\no\n 8\n\n.5\n\u00baW\n\nQy (Sv)\n\ny\nea\n\nrs\n!1\n\n2\n!1\n\n1\n!1\n\n0\n!9\n\n!\n1\n5\n0\n0\n\n!\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n!\n5\n0\n003\n\n7\n.5\n\n\u00baN\n; \n\nb\no\nx\nes\n\n o\nf \n\ntr\nan\n\nsp\no\nrt\n\n c\no\nm\n\np\nu\nta\n\nti\no\nn\n\ndepth (m)\n\nlo\nn\ng\nit\n\nu\nd\ne \n\n(\u00ba\n)\n\nF\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 1\n1\n\n \u2013\n T\n\nim\ne \n\nse\nri\n\nes\n o\n\nf \nm\n\ner\nid\n\nio\nn\n\nal\n t\n\nra\nn\n\nsp\no\n\nrt\n m\n\no\nn\n\nth\nly\n\n m\nea\n\nn\ns \n\nal\no\n\nn\ng\n\n: \n(a\n\n-d\n) \n\n4\n3\n\n\u00baN\n; \n\n(e\n-h\n\n) \n4\n\n0\n\u00baN\n\n; \nan\n\nd\n (\n\ni-\nl)\n\n 3\n7\n\n.5\n\u00baN\n\n. \nE\n\nac\nh\n\n c\no\n\nlu\nm\n\nn\n c\n\no\nrr\n\nes\np\n\no\nn\n\nd\ns \n\nto\n a\n\n s\nu\n\nb\n-s\n\nec\nti\n\no\nn\n\n \nre\n\np\nre\n\nse\nn\n\nte\nd\n\n i\nn\n\n t\nh\n\ne \nri\n\ng\nh\n\ntm\no\n\nst\n c\n\no\nlu\n\nm\nn\n (\n\nd\n, \n\nh\n, \n\nl)\n. \n\nF\nro\n\nm\n l\n\nef\nt \n\nto\n r\n\nig\nh\n\nt:\n (\n\na,\n e\n\n, \ni)\n\n o\nff\n\nsh\no\n\nre\n; \n\n(b\n, \n\nf,\n j\n\n) \nlo\n\nw\ner\n\n s\nlo\n\np\ne \n\nan\nd\n\n a\nd\n\nja\nce\n\nn\nt \n\nu\np\n\np\ner\n\n l\nay\n\ner\ns;\n\n (\nc,\n\n g\n, \n\nk\n) \n\nsh\nel\n\nf/\nu\n\np\np\n\ner\n s\n\nlo\np\n\ne \n(d\n\no\nw\n\nn\n t\n\no\n 4\n\n0\n0\n\n m\n).\n\n S\nea\n\nso\nn\n\nal\n a\n\nv\ner\n\nag\nes\n\n (\nJu\n\nly\n, A\n\nu\ng\n\nu\nst\n\n, \nS\n\nep\nte\n\nm\nb\n\ner\n \u2013\n\n J\nA\n\nS\n \u2013\n\n a\nn\n\nd\n N\n\no\nv\n\nem\nb\n\ner\n, \n\nD\nec\n\nem\nb\n\ner\n, \n\nJa\nn\n\nu\nar\n\ny\n \u2013\n\n N\nD\n\nJ)\n a\n\nre\n p\n\nlo\ntt\n\ned\n i\n\nn\n s\n\nh\nad\n\nes\n o\n\nf \ng\n\nra\ny\n\n f\no\n\nr \nn\n\no\nrt\n\nh\nw\n\nar\nd\n\n \nan\n\nd\n s\n\no\nu\n\nth\nw\n\nar\nd\n\n t\nra\n\nn\nsp\n\no\nrt\n\ns.\n T\n\no\n t\n\nh\ne \n\nle\nft\n\n o\nf \n\nea\nch\n\n p\nlo\n\nt,\n t\n\no\nta\n\nl \nn\n\no\nrt\n\nh\nw\n\nar\nd\n\n a\nn\n\nd\n s\n\no\nu\n\nth\nw\n\nar\nd\n\n a\nv\n\ner\nag\n\nes\n a\n\nre\n i\n\nn\n b\n\nla\nck\n\n b\nar\n\ns \nan\n\nd\n t\n\nh\ne \n\nn\net\n\n a\nv\n\ner\nag\n\ne \nis\n\n i\nn\n\n w\nh\n\nit\ne \n\nb\nar\n\ns.\n\n1\n2\n\u00baW\n\n t\no\n 1\n\n0\n.4\n\n\u00baW\n\ny\nea\n\nrs\n\ny\nea\n\nrs\n\na\n)\n\ne\n)\n\nb\n)\n\nc)\nd\n)\n\nf)\ng\n)\n\nh\n)\n\ni)\nj)\n\nk\n)\n\nl)\n\nFigure 2.11: Time series of meridional transport (Sv) monthly means across (upper row)\n43oN; (middle row) 40oN; and (lower row) 37.5oN. Each column corresponds to a sub-\nsection represented in the rightmost column (d,h,l). From left to right: (a,e,i) offshore;\n(b,f,j) lower slope and adjacent upper layers; (c,g,k) shelf/upper slope (down to 400 m).\nSeasonal averages (July, August, September \u2014 JAS \u2014 and November, December, January\n\u2014 NDJ) are plotted in shades of gray for northward and southward transports. To the\nleft of each plot, total northward and southward averages are in black bars and the net\naverage is in white bars.\n\n36\n\n\n\nResults are shown in Figure 2.11. Each zonal section is divided into three sub-sections\n(hereafter called boxes for simplicity): shelf/upper slope (from the coast to the 400 m\nisobath), lower slope and offshore box. These boxes will hereafter be designated as onshore,\ncentral and offshore boxes, respectively. The boxes are defined individually for each section\nbecause the location of both the upper and lower slope circulation varies with latitude, as\nseen in Figure 2.10. The border of the onshore box was designed to accommodate the\nshelf circulation, and was therefore defined by setting the depth at the 400 m isobath.\nThe separation between the central and the offshore boxes was carried out by defining the\ncentral box as the area of prevailing poleward flow (see Figure 2.10).\n\nThus, monthly means of meridional net transport, with positive (negative) values cor-\nresponding to poleward (equatorward) flow, are shown for 43oN (Figure 2.11 a-c), 40oN\n(Figure 2.11 e-g) and 37.5oN (Figure 2.11 i-k).\n\nAt the onshore boxes (Figure 2.11 c,g,k), the main feature observed is the equatorward\nflow due to upwelling, which presents one main peak centered in July-August and occasion-\nally one or several minor peaks during spring. In wintertime, a poleward flow associated\nwith the inshore intrusion of the IPC is observed on the upper slope. The equatorward\nsummer transport peak is typically 0.5 Sv independent of the latitude, but the spring peak\nspans from less than 0.1 Sv to about 0.3 Sv. Although a clear seasonal cycle of the circula-\ntion is seen for both upwelling and poleward flow, there is also some interannual variability\nin the structure of the peaks associated with the upwelling equatorward transport, both\nin width and intensity. Observing the seasonal cycle, some differences can be remarked\nregarding the equatorward circulation at different latitudes. In the northern and central\nsections (43oN and 40oN, respectively \u2014 Figure 2.11 c,g), the equatorward flow starts\nearly in the year (February) and lingers on until October, whereas in southern Portugal\n(37.5oN \u2014 Figure 2.11 k) a weak and variable circulation is observed during springtime\n(February to May), and the clear signal of upwelling appears in June-July. Furthermore,\npoleward flow along the shelf/upper slope is observed every year for the 43oN and 40oN\nsections, with typical values of 0.2 to 0.3 Sv, starting recursively at the beginning of au-\ntumn and with peaks in December, occasionally with secondary peaks in January. The\nsouthern region does not show clear evidences of poleward flow on the upper slope/shelf.\n\nIn respect to the central (Figure 2.11 b,f,j) and offshore (Figure 2.11 a,e,i) boxes, the\ntransport patterns are not so clearly defined as in the case of the onshore box. For the\nnorthern and central latitudes (43oN and 40oN) at the central box (Figure 2.11 b,f), two\npeaks of poleward flow are observed throughout the year in almost all simulation years:\nthe first one during summertime (July to September), presenting high transport values,\nfrom 3 to 10 Sv; the second peak with smaller amplitudes, 2 to 7 Sv, is observed from\nNovember to January. Both transport peaks have strong interannual variability in terms\nof magnitude. The first peak appears as an offshore poleward flow co-existing with the\ninshore summer upwelling peak (cf. Figure 2.10 b with Figure 2.10 c and Figure 2.10f with\nFigure 2.10 g). This offshore shifting of poleward flow during the upwelling season has also\nbeen reported in hydrographical cruises (Peliz et al., 2002; Torres and Barton, 2007). The\nsecond peak is associated with the winter IPC. Conversely, every year, recurrent peaks of\nequatorward transport are observed during the late winter-spring months. The southern\n\n37\n\n\n\nregion at the central box (Figure 2.11 j) presents a complex pattern, although the tendency\nfor poleward flow with multiple peaks during summer (shaded), late autumn and January\nis still discernible. The tendency for equatorward flow observed during late winter and\nspring is only partially met. Recall that this box is strongly influenced by the MW vein\nand the corresponding shedding of Meddies, which makes it more difficult to interpret than\nthe patterns described for the northern region. Moorings analysis at about 42oN (from the\nFrench project ARCANE, Huthnance et al., 2002, and Colas, 2003) showed that at the\ndepths of ENACW and MW the maximum of poleward flow occurred between August\nand October, although at the surface this maximum was found in December-January;\nfurthermore, in February-March a direction reversal at those levels was observed, with\nequatorward flows of 5 to 10 cm s?1. From float data, the same authors discuss that there\nis a clear slope current of about 2 cm s?1 but that the major poleward flow occurs between\n600 and 1400 m.\n\nThe offshore region (Figure 2.11 a,e,i) is the widest of the three sub-sections, and does\nnot present a clear seasonal pattern as the central and onshore boxes. The northern off-\nshore box (Figure 2.11 a) is characterized by a tendency for equatorward flow, with typical\nvalues of less than 5 Sv, as previously discussed (Figure 2.10 a,d). This behavior is op-\nposite to the central box at the same latitude (Figure 2.11 b), meaning that at 43oN the\npoleward flow is preferentially attached to the slope (central box), which Figure 2.9 b,d\nalso shows. At 40oN (Figure 2.11 e), the offshore box is characterized by high values of\ntransport in both directions, resulting from the anticyclonic vorticity structure of the mean\ncirculation (denoted A3 in Figure 2.9 b and visible in Figure 2.10 b,e). Maze? et al. (1997)\nrefer to a circulation of about 6 Sv for the MW levels at this latitude associated with an\nanticyclonic structure of large dimensions, and Daniault et al. (1994) discuss the existence\nof anticyclonic vorticity there (see discussion above). However, the net overall contribution\n(Figure 2.11 e) is poleward during the summer months with strong interannual variabil-\nity, and presents peaks of poleward flow in February-March. This late winter poleward\ntransport is delayed by two to three months relative to the peaks observed in the central\nbox at 40oN (Figure 2.11 f), which can be interpreted as the westward IPC migration.\nOn the other hand, the separation of the flow associated with A3 occurring north of the\nEstremadura Promontory also explains the poleward tendency in this offshore box.\n\nThe southern (37.5oN) offshore region (Figure 2.11 i) is affected by a strong variabil-\nity, consequence of the spreading of the MW vein and its mesoscale features. However,\nsimilarly to the central box, some features can be observed, such as peaks of poleward\ncurrent during summertime (shaded), and during November-January for most of the years,\nbut also equatorward peaks mainly observed between February and June every year. This\nequatorward flow is, as discussed above, partially associated with recirculation of the pole-\nward flow across the central box. When comparing this offshore transport to the central\nbox one at the same latitude, transport has a clearer tendency for poleward flow at the\ncentral box than the offshore one. This is understandable since most of the MW vein at\nthis latitude tends to circulate poleward by the central box, as shown in Figure 2.10 e,f,\nwhere it is also evident that the offshore circulation across 37.5oN is dominated by the\npresence of a mean anticyclonic vorticity structure denoted by A2 in Figure 2.9 b.\n\n38\n\n\n\nThe meridional transport across the boxes calculated from the results of the model can\nbe compared to those calculated by Maze? et al. (1997) for the Bord-Est 3 cruise during\nMay 1989, for the sections at 37.5oN and 43oN. The authors compute meridional transport\nthrough layers defined by density anomalies in order to quantify transport by the North\nAtlantic Central Waters and by the Mediterranean Water, which corresponds roughly to\nthe layers comprised between the surface and 1500 m depth. Furthermore, the results of\nthe sampled stations provide the transport distribution in longitude ranges, which renders\npossible a comparison to the modeled results. Table 2.1 displays meridional transport\naverages through 43oN, 40oN and 37.5oN, both northward (positive \u2014 Q+\n\ny\n) and southward\n\n(negative \u2014 Q?\ny\n), as well as the net transport. Additionally, the transport through the\n\nentire section is also computed. The values in the work of Maze? et al. (1997) (hereafter\nobservations) were obtained from their Figures 12 and 13 (a,c). The sub-sections refer to\nthe boxes defined in Figure 2.11 for SD and the most approximate values with respect\nto the stations presented by Maze? et al. (1997). Absent values in the observations mean\nno available data. It is important to keep in mind that the observations concern a single\nmonth, whereas our results are 5-year averaged transport across every section.\n\nFor the northern section at 43oN (first column), similar transport values are reported,\nwhich consist in prevailing northward transport in the central box and prevailing southward\ntransport in the offshore box, giving rise to a full net southward transport of about 1 Sv\nfor SD and about 2 Sv for the observations. For the southern region at 37.5oN (last\ncolumn), transport calculation is more complicated because of the presence of a Meddy in\nthe observations, partially sampled along the western side of the section, that accounts for\nabout 6.6 Sv of southward transport at the MW levels. Therefore, the transport through\nthe offshore box was corrected subtracting this value from the southward total, which would\namount to 21.4 instead of the 14.8 Sv presented in Table 2.1, as marked with an asterisk.\nThe southward transports are similar in magnitude. As for the northward transport, in\nSD at the central box, values are lower than the observations (6.2 Sv against 10.2 Sv, a\ndifference of 4 Sv); however, they are higher at the offshore box with the same difference\nof 4 Sv (12.5 Sv against 8.5 Sv for the observations), which may mean that the poleward\nflow crosses 37.5oN at different longitudes. There can be another explanation. Following\nthe interpretation of Maze? et al. (1997), from the 10.2 Sv that flow northward across\nthe central box, approximately half continues northward, and the other half recirculates\nsouthward to the west, that is, its contribution adds to the offshore southward transport\nof 14.8 Sv (as schematically represented in Figure 15 of their work). Then, the exceeding\nnorthward transport in SD at the offshore box may be due to the anticyclonic vorticity\nstructure (see Figure 2.9 b and Figure 2.10 c,f), which in the observations is west of 12oW\nand is therefore not taken into account.\n\nAlthough Maze? et al. (1997) do not provide data for 40oN, the model results are also\nshown in Table 2.1 (middle column). Transport is, in terms of balance, northward at the\noffshore box and southward at the central and inshore boxes. This is due to the separation\nof the flow that occurs at this latitude, associated with the mean anticyclonic vorticity\nregion discussed in this section (see Figure 2.9 b and Figure 2.10 b,e), which accounts for\nthe strong northward and southward transports at the offshore box.\n\n39\n\n\n\nL\na\ntitu\n\nd\ne\n\n4\n3\noN\n\n4\n0\noN\n\n3\n7\n.5\n\noN\nS\nu\nb\n-sectio\n\nn\nO\nff\nsh\no\nre\n\nC\nen\ntra\n\nl\nO\nn\nsh\no\nre\n\nT\no\nta\n\nl\nO\nff\nsh\no\nre\n\nC\nen\ntra\n\nl\nO\nn\nsh\no\nre\n\nT\no\nta\n\nl\nO\nff\nsh\no\nre\n\nC\nen\ntra\n\nl\nO\nn\nsh\no\nre\n\nT\no\nta\n\nl\nM\na\nze?\n\nQ\n+y\n\n4\n.0\n\n5\n.9\n\n-\n9\n.9\n\n-\n-\n\n-\n-\n\n8\n.5\n\n1\n0\n.2\n\n1\n.2\n\n1\n9\n.9\n\net\na\nl.\n\nQ\n?y\n\n-6\n.4\n\n-1\n.4\n\n-\n-7\n.8\n\n-\n-\n\n-\n-\n\n?\n1\n4\n.8?\n\n-1\n.2\n\n0\n-1\n6\n.0?\n\n(1\n9\n9\n7\n)\n\nN\ne\nt\n\n-2\n.4\n\n4\n.5\n\n-\n-2\n.1\n\n-\n-\n\n-\n-\n\n-6\n.3?\n\n9\n.0\n\n1\n.2\n\n3\n.9?\n\nQ\n+y\n\n3\n.6\n\n3\n.1\n\n0\n.1\n\n6\n.8\n\n1\n5\n.9\n\n1\n.6\n\n0\n.1\n\n1\n7\n.6\n\n1\n2\n.5\n\n6\n.2\n\n0\n.1\n\n1\n8\n.8\n\nS\nD\n\nQ\n?y\n\n-5\n.9\n\n-1\n.7\n\n-0\n.3\n\n-7\n.9\n\n-1\n3\n.7\n\n-2\n.1\n\n-0\n.3\n\n-1\n6\n.1\n\n-1\n3\n.1\n\n-4\n.5\n\n-0\n.2\n\n-1\n7\n.8\n\nN\ne\nt\n\n-2\n.3\n\n1\n.4\n\n-0\n.2\n\n-1\n.1\n\n2\n.2\n\n-0\n.5\n\n-0\n.2\n\n1\n.5\n\n-0\n.6\n\n1\n.7\n\n-0\n.1\n\n1\n.0\n\nT\na\nb\nle\n\n2\n.1\n:\nM\nea\nn\nm\nerid\n\nio\nn\na\nl\ntra\n\nn\nsp\no\nrts\n\n(S\nv\n)\na\ncro\n\nss\nth\nree\n\nsectio\nn\ns\no\nff\nW\n\nIM\nin\nteg\n\nra\nted\n\nfro\nm\n\n0\nto\n\n1\n5\n0\n0\nm\n,\na\nt\nla\ntitu\n\nd\nes\n\n3\n7\n.5\n\noN\n,\n4\n0\noN\n\na\nn\nd\n4\n3\noN\n\n.\nF\no\nr\nea\nch\n\nzo\nn\na\nl\nsectio\n\nn\n,\nth\nree\n\nsu\nb\nsectio\n\nn\ns\nin\n\nlo\nn\ng\nitu\n\nd\ne\nw\nere\n\nd\nefi\nn\ned\n\na\ncco\n\nrd\nin\ng\nto\n\nF\nig\nu\nre\n\n2\n.1\n1\n:\n\nO\nn\nsh\no\nre,\n\nC\nen\ntra\n\nl\na\nn\nd\nO\nff\nsh\no\nre.\n\nT\nh\ne\nco\nrresp\n\no\nn\nd\nin\ng\ntra\n\nn\nsp\no\nrts\n\nfo\nr\nth\ne\nsa\nm\ne\nsectio\n\nn\ns\no\nf\nM\na\nze?\n\net\na\nl.\n\n(1\n9\n9\n7\n)\na\nre\n\nsh\now\n\nn\nfo\nr\n\nco\nm\np\na\nriso\n\nn\nw\nith\n\nm\no\nd\neled\n\ntra\nn\nsp\no\nrts.\n\n40\n\n\n\n2.6 Lagrangian Considerations\n\nThis section addresses the origin of upwelled waters along the Western Iberian Margin\nduring the upwelling season. We apply a Lagrangian particle model run back in time to\nthe climatological run described above, in order to trace the preferential pathways of these\nwaters, as well as the depths of origin and the distances traveled in one month.\n\n2.6.1 Lagrangian Model\n\nThe Lagrangian particle model runs offline over the climatological simulation. It con-\nsists in an Individual Based Model (IBM), coupled to ROMS using ROFF (Carr et al.,\n2007). ROFF is a drifter-tracking code that simulates Lagrangian trajectories from stored\nROMS velocity and hydrological fields using a high-order predictor corrector scheme to\nintegrate the motion equation dX/dt = UROMS(X, t), with X being the position vector\n(x, y, z), and UROMS being the modeled 3D velocity vector over time, given an initial con-\ndition X(t0) = X0. In addition to the advection generated by the model velocities, the\nparticle movements include random velocities in the vertical direction, which are used to\nparameterize unresolved turbulent processes.\n\nThe particle model allows the trajectories of a cluster of particles to be tracked during a\ngiven period. Our purpose is to study the particles arriving at the Western Iberian Margin,\nbut since ROFF runs backward in time, the particles are actually deployed from the coastal\nregion along WIM where upwelling occurs, what we call areas of arrival. We defined\nfour areas of arrival, approximately limited offshore by the 200-m isobath (Figure 2.1):\nGalician Rias (GR), Northern Portuguese Coast (NC), Estremadura Promontory (EP)\nand Southern Portuguese Coast (SC). The particles were released in all grid points at\nthree different depths: 20 m, 40 m and 60 m. Furthermore, particles were released on\nthree dates: June 30, July 30 and August 30. Their trajectories were traced backward\nfor one month; therefore their departure points were on June 1, July 1, and August 1,\nrespectively. During that month of travel, we have information on the particles horizontal\nand vertical displacement. The number of particles depends on the area of arrival and its\ncorresponding grid: 284 at GR; 388 at EP (the largest area); 325 at NC; and 156 at SC\n(the narrowest). Thus, the total number of particles is three times these values, since the\nstudy is carried out for 3 months. The Lagrangian module only runs over the last year of\nsimulation.\n\nAlthough the configuration has been designed to track particles from the point of arrival\nback to their point of origin, the discussion refers to the particles as if deployed at their\npoints of origin and terminating at the four arrival areas illustrated in Figure 2.1. For\nsimplification, particles that arrive at 20 m, 40 m and 60 m will be henceforth designated\nas 20-m, 40-m and 60-m particles, respectively. In addition, the mean SST for June is also\nshown, as well as the maximum southward meridional velocities. This figure will be used in\nthe interpretation of trajectory maps, as well as in considerations concerning the distance\nof the particles from the coast, distance traveled and mean depths of origin, discussed in\nthe following sub-section.\n\n41\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  12\no\nW   11\n\no\nW   10\n\no\nW    9\n\no\nW    8\n\no\nW    7\n\no\nW    6\n\no\nW \n\n  36\no\nN \n\n  38\no\nN \n\n  40\no\nN \n\n  42\no\nN \n\n  44\no\nN \n\n14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21\n\nFigure 2.12: Mean field of SST for June of the last year of simulation of SD. The thick\nblack line represents meridional velocities of -25 cm s?1 for the same month. The 200-m\nisobath is shown by the blue line.\n\n2.6.2 Trajectories\n\nOn a first approach, to avoid overloading the maps, only the preferential pathways of\nupwelled waters arriving on June 30 were considered, since these were similar to the other\nmonths studied. The left column of Figure 2.13 shows the trajectories of particles arriving\nat 20 m (gray dots), 40 m (black dots) and 60 m (white dots), and the right column shows\nthe origin points of each particle, with the information of its depth on June 1 (t = 0) given\nby the gray shades. In general, the 20-m particles have their origin at farther locations to\nthe north, but mainly at shallow depths. Indeed, the 200-m isobath seems to delimit the\nparticles trajectories, which are mainly alongshore and close to the coast. As for the 40-m\nand 60-m particles, they appear to have similar trajectory patterns, their origin sometimes\nlocated inshore to the north, others from closer offshore regions. The NC and EP locations\n(Figure 2.13 c,e) show more alongshore pathways, accompanying the shoreline, whereas GR\nand SC (Figure 2.13 a,g) present some meandering. These results are consistent with the\n\n42\n\n\n\naverage signature of the upwelling and associated equatorward jet, shown in Figure 2.12.\nThe coastal cold band is approximately limited by the 200-m isobath, typically at 40 km\ndistant from the coast.\n\nFurthermore, it is evident that, in general, the particles that originated the farthest from\ntheir arrival site came from shallower depths. This is most evident at NC (Figure 2.13 d).\nThere are some exceptions, however. In GR and EP (Figure 2.13 b,f), there are some\nparticles whose origin is offshore the WIM at approximately 10oW and with depths of over\n80 m, and also off Estremadura Promontory for particles arriving at SC (Figure 2.13 h).\nIt is apparent that particles originate at shallower depths at the southern coast than at\nnorthern locations.\n\n2.6.3 Quantitative Analysis\n\nThe following analyses concern the three sets of data, from the Lagrangian simulations\nof June, July and August. Figure 2.14 shows the distribution of the depths of origin\naccording to region. Histogram bars correspond to depth intervals. The x-axis labels are\nthe maximum depths of each interval, that is: \u2018-50\u2019 corresponds to the interval 0-50 m,\n\u2018-100\u2019 corresponds to 50-100 m, and so forth. The first interval of 0-50 m registers the\nhighest occurrences for all regions and for all depths of arrival. Percentages are of 80% for\nthe 20-m particles, 60% to 70% for the 40-m particles from north to south, and between\n30% and 50% for the 60-m particles. Regarding the other depth intervals, the behavior is\nnot quite as uniform. At GR (Figure 2.14 a) and EP (Figure 2.14 c), particles originate\nmainly from depths between 50 and 100 m and between 150 and 200 m, but the other\ndepth intervals still register occurrences. At NC (Figure 2.14 b), preferential depths of\norigin are 100-150 m, especially for 60-m particles (? 25%), and 200-250 m and there are\nno particles arriving from depths greater than 300 m. At SC (Figure 2.14 d), particles\noriginate preferentially from the 50-100 m interval: 60-m particles register above 40% and\n20- and 40-m particles register roughly 20%. Here, there are no particles coming from\ndepths of more than 200 m.\n\nAdditionally, Figure 2.15 shows the correspondence between distance traveled by the\nparticles, from their point of origin to the arrival point, and their depth of origin. It is\nnoticeable that the farther the particles have traveled from their origin, the shallower their\norigin is. The northern locations register the farthest origins, all corresponding to 20-m\nparticles.\n\nObserving Figure 2.12, it is clear that the highest velocities of the equatorward jet\nare found north of 40oN, consistent with these results. All regions and particles show a\ntendency of decrease in distance traveled as the depth of arrival increases except for SC\n(Figure 2.15 d). Indeed, the southernmost location shows a homogeneous distribution of\ndistance traveled independently of the depth of arrival. According to Figure 2.12, the\nsouthward velocities in this area are lower than in all others, that is, conditions are less\nprone for particles to travel large distances. The deepest points of origin were mainly\nrecorded for the 60-m particles. It is also noticeable that these maximum depths are found\nat GR and EP (Figure 2.15 a,c).\n\n43\n\n\n\n  12\no\nW   10\n\no\nW    8\n\no\nW    6\n\no\nW \n\n  40\no\nN \n\n  41\no\nN \n\n  42\no\nN \n\n  43\no\nN \n\n  44\no\nN \n\n  12\no\nW   10\n\no\nW    8\n\no\nW    6\n\no\nW \n\n \n\n  42\no\nN \n\n \n\n  43\no\nN \n\n  44\no\nN \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n20 m\n\n40 m\n\n60 m\n\na)\n\nc)\n\n  12\no\nW   10\n\no\nW    8\n\no\nW    6\n\no\nW \n\n  40\no\nN \n\n  41\no\nN \n\n  42\no\nN \n\n  43\no\nN \n\n  44\no\nN \n\n  12\no\nW   10\n\no\nW    8\n\no\nW    6\n\no\nW \n\n \n\n  42\no\nN \n\n \n\n  43\no\nN \n\n \n\n  44\no\nN \n\n \n\nb)\n\nd)\n\n  12\no\nW   10\n\no\nW    8\n\no\nW    6\n\no\nW \n\n \n\n  38\no\nN \n\n \n\n  39\no\nN \n\n \n\n  40\no\nN \n\n  12\no\nW   10\n\no\nW    8\n\no\nW    6\n\no\nW \n\n  39\no\nN \n\n  40\no\nN \n\n  41\no\nN \n\n  42\no\nN \n\ne)\n\ng)\n\n  12\no\nW   10\n\no\nW    8\n\no\nW    6\n\no\nW \n\n  38\no\nN \n\n  39\no\nN \n\n  40\no\nN \n\n  12\no\nW   10\n\no\nW    8\n\no\nW    6\n\no\nW \n\n  39\no\nN \n\n  40\no\nN \n\n  41\no\nN \n\n  42\no\nN \n\n \n\n \n\nf)\n\nh)\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\n220\n\n240\n\nFigure 2.13: (left column) Trajectories of particles arriving on June 30 (20-m particles:\nblack dots; 40-m particles: gray dots; 60-m particles: white dots) and (right column)\nlocation and depth of origin of each particle (colorbar in km) for the four arrival locations:\n(a,b) GR; (c,d) NC; (e,f) EP; (g,h) SC. The 200-m isobath is shown.\n\n44\n\n\n\nSince the trajectory maps reveal a tendency for the particles that travel the greatest\ndistances to trace an alongshore path limited to the upper 200 m of the water column,\nthe mean depth computed for each particle along its trajectory was plotted against its\nmean distance to the coast (Figure 2.16). For NC and EP (Figure 2.16 b,c) the particles\nthat originate farthest from the coast (on average 80 km) come from the same depths as\nthose from which they later upwell; they essentially have surface/subsurface trajectories.\nThese particles may be influenced by the upwelling-associated mesoscale phenomena. On\nthe other hand, particles whose trajectories were traced, on average, to depths of more\nthan 120 m have never reached distances greater than 20 km from the coast, which is the\naverage distance of the 100-m isobath as discussed in the previous sub-section regarding\nFigures 2.13 and 2.14. These particles seem to travel mainly through the equatorward jet\nor come from lower levels directly below their upwelling site, where the associated upward\nmotion of replacement of surface waters with deeper waters takes place.\n\n!350 !300 !250 !200 !150 !100  !50\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n!350 !300 !250 !200 !150 !100  !50\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n!350 !300 !250 !200 !150 !100  !50\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n!350 !300 !250 !200 !150 !100  !50\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\ndepth (m)\n\n%\n o\n\nf \np\n\na\nrt\n\nic\nle\n\ns\n\n \n\n \n\n20 m\n\n40 m\n\n60 m\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nd)\n\nFigure 2.14: Histograms of the origin depth of all particles (3 months) arriving at 20 m\n(black), 40 m (gray) and 60 m (white), for the four locations of arrival: (a) GR; (b) NC;\n(c) EP; (d) SC.\n\n45\n\n\n\nIt is important to notice that the regions of the Galician Rias and Estremadura Promon-\ntory are somewhat different from the others. The GR is characterized by a jagged coastline\nwith several estuaries and bays, and the EP is a prominent topographic feature. Both loca-\ntions are prone to the development of filaments, that is, detachments of flow from the main\nalongshore path of the equatorward jet (Torres and Barton, 2007; Oliveira et al., 2009).\nAt these locations, the upwelled waters originate at greater depths and traveled shorter\ndistances, suggesting that their trajectories are dependent on local mesoscale activity. In\ncontrast, at the Portuguese northern and southern coasts, which are roughly meridional\ncoasts, upwelled waters come from larger distances and shallower depths, being mostly\ndependent on the core alongshore equatorward jet, flowing within 20-40 km of the coast\nand with velocities that reach 30 cm s?1, as observed in section 2.4.\n\n!600 !500 !400 !300 !200 !100 0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\ndepth (m)\n\nd\nis\n\nta\nn\n\nce\n t\n\nra\nve\n\nle\nd\n\n (\nkm\n\n)\n\n!600 !500 !400 !300 !200 !100 0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n!600 !500 !400 !300 !200 !100 0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n!600 !500 !400 !300 !200 !100 0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n \n\n \n\n20 m\n\n40 m\n\n60 m\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nd)\n\nFigure 2.15: Distance traveled according to depth of origin of all particles (3 months), for\nthe four locations of arrival: (a) GR; (b) NC; (c) EP; (d) SC.\n\n46\n\n\n\n!260 !240 !220 !200 !180 !160 !140 !120 !100 !80 !60 !40 !20 0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nm\ne\n\na\nn\n\n d\nis\n\nta\nn\n\nce\n t\n\no\n t\n\nh\ne\n\n c\no\n\na\nst\n\n (\nk\n\nm\n)\n\nmean depth (m)\n\n!260 !240 !220 !200 !180 !160 !140 !120 !100 !80 !60 !40 !20 0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n!260 !240 !220 !200 !180 !160 !140 !120 !100 !80 !60 !40 !20 0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n!260 !240 !220 !200 !180 !160 !140 !120 !100 !80 !60 !40 !20 0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n \n\n \n\n20 m\n\n40 m\n\n60 m\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nd)\n\nFigure 2.16: Mean distance to the coast of all trajectories (3 months) according to the\ntrajectories mean depth, for the four locations of arrival: (a) GR; (b) NC; (c) EP; (d) SC.\n\n2.7 Discussion\n\nThe purpose of this study was to model the mean circulation of the Western Iberian\nMargin, as well as the seasonal cycle of the hydrographic fields. Three phenomena play\nthe most important roles in setting both hydrography and flow: summer coastal upwelling,\nthe Iberian Poleward Current and the Mediterranean Water outflow through the Strait of\nGibraltar. The main focus was to integrate these phenomena into a numerical configura-\ntion that takes into account not only the large-scale features such as the Azores Current\nand the meridional density gradient, but also small-scale features such as the entrance of\nMW into the Atlantic and river inflow. A thorough characterization of the mean hydrog-\nraphy and flow on the shelf/slope was carried out, as well as the connection between the\nintermediate circulation (at the MW levels) and the surface layers. The prevalence of the\nslope poleward flow throughout the year is also explored.\n\n47\n\n\n\na. Circulation Considerations\nThe used forcing was the COADS climatology. With this forcing, which contains no\n\ninterannual variability or synoptic meteorological scale variability, the purpose was to reach\na realistic circulation as a result of the adjustment of the hydrographic fields. Concerning\nthis resulting circulation, many of the modeled features have their correspondence in the\navailable observations.\n\nThe main pattern of the circulation consists in a poleward flow along the slope during\nwinter and lingering on in summer. The IPC has been regarded as a baroclinic current that\nresults from the isopycnal field adjustment at the upper slope. In addition to this classic\nview, Torres and Barton (2006) estimated a mean transport of 2 Sv from the surface down\nto 500 m and postulated that the poleward flow could penetrate down to the levels of MW.\nThe authors hypothesize that a poleward flow at the MW levels would arise from different\ndynamical reasons, but can form a continuous flow inducing topographic guidance of the\nsurface flow. This behavior is well reproduced by the model results, suggesting that the\npoleward flow extends downward to the levels of the MW and has a marked barotropic\ncharacter.\n\nThe winter flow patterns obtained by the SD configuration resemble the typical de-\nscription of poleward flow in the literature. The model results also suggest interannual\nvariability associated with intrinsic variability, that is, not resulting from external forcing.\nHowever, this interannual variability does not explain episodes of strong alongshore current\nobserved in particular years only (January 1990, 1996, 1998 as reported in Garc??a-Soto et\nal., 2002, and Peliz et al., 2005). This means that factors other than climatological forcing\nor large-scale forcing, both imposed seasonally but with no interannual variability, may\nexplain the variability and the years of extreme poleward flow, not described within our\nsimulations.\n\nWhen considering the mean fields of hydrographic properties and alongshore velocity\nfor several years (5 years in this case), we obtain a picture of a poleward flow extending\nfrom the surface down to the levels of the MW, centered at about 10oW, with weak vertical\nshear and typical velocities of 6 to 10 cm s?1 for winter and summer, although with some\nweakening at the surface in this season (Figure 2.10). This coupling between the MW and\nthe central water layers was already reported by Maze? et al. (1997). Moreover, observations\nof Huthnance et al. (2002) report maximum poleward flow at moorings near 42oN, 9.5oW\nin September-October for all depths, a secondary peak in December-January at the upper-\nmost currentmeter, and a maximum of equatorward flow in February-April. These features\nresemble the transport patterns in the central box for section 43oN (Figure 2.11 b). Like-\nwise, persistent poleward flow at about 250 m depth at a location near 42.3oN, 10.2oW is\nreported by Peliz et al. (2005) based on datasets of the Instituto Espan?ol de Oceanograf??a\n(Alonso et al., 1995), where the intensity of the poleward current was about 10 cm s?1 and\nno correlation between winds and currents was found at this mooring. This tendency to\npoleward flow at this longitude is comparable to the mean values presented in Figure 2.10.\n\nConcerning the issue related with the presence of poleward flow during the upwelling\n\n48\n\n\n\nseason, Peliz et al. (2002) presented evidences of such behavior for central Portugal. Torres\nand Barton (2007) studied the Galician shelf/slope based on hydrography and ADCP mea-\nsurements and also showed the coexistence of offshore poleward flow during June 1997 at\nthe starting of the upwelling season. Process studies about the consequences of upwelling-\nrelated flow on poleward currents, such as by Peliz et al. (2003b), show that the poleward\nflow does lose intensity and spreads more offshore while keeping its identity. The presence\nof poleward flow in summertime is further confirmed by the series of currentmeter moorings\ndiscussed in the review by Relvas et al. (2007). The model results suggest that poleward\nflow is present along the slope and coexist with the upwelling-associated flow along the\nshelf/upper slope. This is visible not only in the mean alongshore velocities, but also in\nthe transport associated with the central (slope) box.\n\nA schematic view of the annual circulation at 1000 m (which extends its main features\nup to the surface layers), showing the main paths of the mean circulation, is proposed in\nFigure 2.17. The MW vein enters through the Cape St Vincent-Gorringe Bank gateway\nand flows in the northwestward direction, separating from the southwestern slope of the\nIberian Peninsula (near Cape St Vincent) through an anticyclonic mean vorticity region\n(A1). Part of the flow continues poleward along the slope and part recirculates southward\nthrough a cyclonic mean vorticity region (C2) and continues poleward offshore due to the\npresence of another anticyclonic structure (A2). Both poleward branches, at the slope and\noffshore, give rise to the A3 anticyclonic region north of the Estremadura Promontory, al-\nthough there is still flow along the slope, contouring the promontory. At the northern flank\nof this mean vorticity region, results suggest a new separation: part of the flow returns\ntoward the coast and continues as the slope poleward flow, which is linked to the Iberian\nPoleward Current; the other part circulates poleward in another offshore branch between\n11oW and 12oW. The slope poleward flow seems to separate south of 42oN and joins the\noffshore branch, exiting afterward the domain south of the Galicia Bank. The slope branch\ncontinues to flow northward along Cape Finisterre, with evidences of a separation at the\nnorthwestern tip of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nb. Lagrangian Considerations\nThis work enabled us to draw a general picture of the origin of upwelled waters on\n\nthe Western Iberian Margin and preferential paths according to location, and trace some\nrelationships between depth of origin and distance traveled by these waters, as well as the\ntrajectories mean distance to the coast and mean depth.\n\nThere is a general tendency for the particles that upwell at the WIM to come from\nthe north, following the main pathway of the upwelling-associated equatorward jet, mostly\nrestricted to first 20 km offshore (delimited roughly by the 100-m isobath). From these,\nthe particles arriving at 60 m are more prone to come from deeper levels than particles\narriving at 20 m. Moreover, the particles that travel the longest distances (up to 500 km\nat northern WIM and 400 km at southern WIM) usually originate from the upper 100 m.\nConversely, the particles that travel the least (<100 km) originate from the deepest levels\n(up to 500-600 m at GR and EP and 200-300 m at NC and SC). The 20-m particles tend\n\n49\n\n\n\n200\n1000\n\n50\n00\n\n5000\n\n5000\n\n  11\no\nW    9\n\no\nW    7\n\no\nW \n\n  35\no\nN \n\n  37\no\nN \n\n  39\no\nN \n\n  41\no\nN \n\n  43\no\nN \n\n  45\no\nN \n\nA2\n\nA1\n\nA3\n\nC2\n\nC1\n!-plume\n\nIP\nC\n\nFigure 2.17: Schematic representation of the mean circulation at 1000 m as obtained from\nthe present numerical modeling study, showing the main paths of the obtained circulation\nstructures, and the recirculation vorticity structures.\n\nto come from farther distances than 40-m and 60-m particles. On the other hand, the\nparticles that have come from deeper levels are the ones whose trajectories, on average,\nwere always within 20-40 km from the coast, that is, they come from the north and trace\nalongshore paths until their upwelling site. Also, there is a tendency for particles in some\nof the regions to travel mostly at the depths at which they afterward upwell.\n\nIt is also suggested that particles that have origins the farthest away from their upwelling\nregions, and hence the shallowest origins and whose trajectories are closest to the coast,\nare dependent on the equatorward jet, while particles that originate closer to the coast,\nand hence at deeper levels and sometimes from more offshore locations, are modulated by\nmesoscale activity.\n\n50\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nInterannual Variability of the\nWestern Iberian Margin Circulation:\n2001-2011\n\nPart of the contents of this chapter have been published by Ramos et al. (2013).\n\n3.1 Overview\n\nAfter portraying the mean state of the region under scope, hydrographically and dy-\nnamically, the following chapter focuses on the domain interannual variability. Despite the\nsystem very pronounced seasonal variability, it is also very prone to smaller space scale\nphenomena that are responsible for the differences that are observed from one year to\nthe next. Mesoscale vortices and upwelling-associated filaments are among the dynamical\nfeatures responsible for non-linear behavior in this current system. The atmospheric inter-\nannual variability is also a key factor in determining years with stronger or weaker summer\nupwelling, or the pathways of the poleward flow.\n\nDue to their importance in the maintenance of the associated marine ecosystems, up-\nwelling regions have been the subject of study for the assessment of significant changes\nin the past decades. One of the first important works on this matter is the already men-\ntioned work of Bakun (1990), where the four upwelling systems were under scope and,\nbased on observations for period 1946-1988, the author found that all systems showed an\nalongshore wind stress intensification trend during summer, which would implicate an up-\nwelling intensification. Regarding a more regional scale and for a longer period, Lemos and\nPires (2004) found a weakening trend for the longer 1941-2000 period for western Iberian\nPeninsula when analyzing both meridional wind component and SST datasets, although\npunctuated by strong interannual variability. The analysis of annual or seasonal signal\ntendency may hide different behaviors at the monthly scale. In this light, Alvarez et al.\n(2008) confirmed the negative tendency for period 1967-2006 for months March, April and\nJuly to December, but found a positive trend for the remaining months, concluding that\n\n51\n\n\n\nthere is no clear seasonal trend in upwelling intensity in the past decades. On the other\nhand, Santos et al. (2005), based on a shorter satellite-based SST dataset, reported an\nupwelling regime shift in the early 1990s to stronger upwelling events, after a positive\nmaximum of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) winter index, corroborated by stronger\ncoastal zonal gradients in summer from 1992 onward. Furthermore, Borges et al. (2003)\nfound a higher frequency in northerly wind occurrence during winter, and consequently an\nincrease in winter upwelling events. The difficulty to assess trends of upwelling activity\nhas been summarized recently when Narayan et al. (2010) showed that there can be large\ndiscrepancies when analyzing trends derived from upwelling indicators (wind stress and\nSST), since they depend on the dataset used. Recently, Barton et al. (2013), using dif-\nferent wind datasets, found no wind intensification evidence along the Canary Upwelling\nSystem, both off WIM and off northwestern Africa.\n\nThis chapter is divided into two parts. The first part makes use of available data\nconcerning the upwelling index (UI) all along the WIM and consists in a description of\nthe interannual variability of upwelling from 1967 to 2011, where possible reasons for this\nvariability are discussed (published in Ramos et al., 2013). The focus of the second part,\non the other hand, is a regional numerical modeling study much like the one carried out in\nchapter 2, with the same configurations, but instead of climatologically-forced, and with\nthe objective of discussing further the interannual variability of this system, the ROMS\nrun was forced with real winds and fluxes for the period 2001-2011, as detailed below.\n\n3.2 Data and Methodology\n\n3.2.1 Upwelling Index\n\nThe upwelling index (UI) is a measure of occurrence of upwelling. There are, in gen-\neral, two ways to compute this quantity, both already used for the WIM: (1) the Ekman\ntransport perpendicular to the coastline, that is, generated by the alongshore wind stress\ncomponent (e.g. Alvarez et al., 2008); (2) the difference between coastal (10-50 km) and\noceanic (? 500 km) SST (e.g. Santos et al., 2005). Both methods have advantages and\ncaveats and some of these are discussed here. The first method, despite being based on\nthe known effect of wind stress over the ocean surface and adjacent layers, which is the\nmain driver of upwelling, does not account for the effects of capes and other coastal fea-\ntures, or mesoscale phenomena of which upwelling is also dependent on (Peliz et al., 2002;\nRelvas et al., 2009). The second approach is more of a proxy for upwelling occurrence,\nsince upwelling is not the only cause for offshore-onshore SST differences; SST is strongly\ninfluenced by other phenomena such as river discharge in coastal areas and large-scale\ncirculation offshore (Go?mez-Gesteira et al., 2008).\n\nIn this study, the UI was provided by the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO\n\u2014 http://www.indicedeafloramiento.ieo.es) and was computed by means of geostrophic\nwinds following the method by Bakun (1973) and adapted later to the Iberian Peninsula\nby Lav??n et al. (1991, 2000) (see formulation used by IEO below). The geostrophic\n\n52\n\n\n\n  12\no\nW   10\n\no\nW    8\n\no\nW    6\n\no\nW \n\n  36\no\nN \n\n  38\no\nN \n\n  40\no\nN \n\n  42\no\nN \n\n  44\no\nN \n\nFigure 3.1: SD and the points/sections of analysis in this chapter.

Blue dashed lines: S and v sections of\nFigure 3.11. Red dashed lines: sections of transport computation in Figure 3.13.\n\nwinds were computed from 6-hourly atmospheric sea level pressure (SLP) fields (at a 1o\n\nresolution) obtained from the U.S. Navy Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography\nCenter (FNMOC) for the 1967-2011 period. The use of the FNMOC SLP fields to compute\nthe UI index has been used widely in different studies (e.g. Bograd et al., 2009, and namely\nfor western Iberia Alvarez et al., 2011, and Mac??as et al., 2012).\n\nGiven the almost meridional character of the western coast of the Iberian Peninsula\n(Figure 3.1), UI can be formulated solely taking into account the cross-shore component\n\n53\n\n\n\nof the Ekman transport:\n\nUI = ?\n?y\n\n?swf\n(3.1)\n\nwhere ?y = ?aCD\n?\nu2 + v2v is the meridional wind stress component (?a ? 1.22 kg m?3\n\nis the air density, CD an adimensional drag coefficient (1.4 \u00d7 10?3), u and v are the zonal\nand meridional components of the geostrophic wind, respectively, ?sw is the average density\nof seawater (? 1025 kg m?3), and f = 2? sin(?) is the Coriolis parameter (? is the angular\nvelocity of the Earth and ? the latitude). The zonal and meridional components of the\ngeostrophic wind were computed as follows:\n\nu =\n?1\n?af\n\n?p\n\n?y\nand v =\n\n1\n\n?af\n\n?p\n\n?x\n(3.2)\n\nA friction correction (30% wind speed reduction and 15o wind direction shift) was\napplied by the IEO to these geostrophic winds before the upwelling estimate is computed\n(Bakun, 1973; Lav??n et al., 1991). The UI was multiplied by a factor of 1000, so that the\nmeasure translates a displacement of volume for each kilometer of coast (m3s?1km?1).\n\nUI is positive when the Ekman transport is oriented offshore (i.e. westward) and thus\nupwelling-favorable, and negative when the Ekman transport is onshore (eastward) and\nthus downwelling-favorable. The six locations (a-f) at which the UI was computed and\nanalyzed in this study are shown in Figure 3.1. Throughout the analysis, monthly-averaged\nUI indices were sued, computed from the 6-hourly data available at the IEO database.\n\nRamos et al. (2013) have validated this UI dataset with wind data from a buoy located\nat approximately 50 km from the point of Rias Baixas (10oW, 42oN). This buoy has data\nsince 1999, and the comparison between the two monthly UI time series for summer (April\nto September) showed they are significantly correlated (at the 5% level) in all months\nexcept in July.\n\n3.2.2 ROMS Forcing\n\nROMS two-domain nesting configuration has already been described. Both FD and SD\nforcing is the same, but FD was first initialized from rest using monthly temperature and\nsalinity climatologies from the World Ocean Atlas 2009 at the boundaries (Antonov et al.,\n2010; Locarnini et al., 2010), and was forced using monthly surface fluxes from Comprehen-\nsive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS), similarly to the simulation in chapter 2. This\nFD configuration reached equilibrium solutions after four years. At this stage, the Mediter-\nranean Water (MW) is represented using a nudging term. After that period, and once the\nocean reaches equilibrium, realistic forcing at the surface (instead of a climatological one)\nwas used. The forcing consisted of the NCEP2 air-sea fluxes (www.ncep.noaa.gov) and\nQuikSCAT/ASCAT reanalyzed satellite winds from CERSAT (cersat.ifremer.fr) for the\nperiod 2001 to 2011, with a spatial resolution of 0.25o (QuikSCAT was replaced by AS-\nCAT in 2009). The outputs of FD were used to initialize and provide boundary conditions\nfor SD through offline nesting. The forcing of SD was the same as for the FD, ensuring\n\n54\n\n\n\nconsistency for both domains and avoiding problems at the boundaries. For the target\ndomain, the Mediterranean Undercurrent (MU), previously described, is imposed by the\nsame boundary inflow/outflow condition at the Strait of Gibraltar as in chapter 2. The\ninflow of freshwater to the ocean originated from the main rivers of the region was included\nin the form of realistic river outflow (provided by INAG, Water Institute of Portugal), when\navailable. When there were no registers of river outflow during a given period of time, a\nclimatological value for seasonal river outflow was imposed.\n\n3.2.3 Satellite and HF-Radar\n\nThe SST satellite product is the same as in section 2.2.3, but instead of computing\nmonthly averages for building a climatology, monthly means for each year for period 2001-\n2011 were used, averaged over the entire SD.\n\nGalician SeaSonde HF radar network provides real time surface currents, wave data\nand currents forecast information, with a range of up to 200 km offshore. Its operation\nand exploitation is the responsibility of Puertos del Estado (www.puertos.es), INTECMAR\n(www.intecmar.org) and MeteoGalicia (www.meteogalicia.es). The two radar antennas are\nlocated near Cape Finisterre (42.88oN, 9.27oW) and Cape Silleiro (42.10oN, 8.89oW) (see\nFigure 3.1). The hourly data was filtered in order to remove the tides.\n\n3.2.4 Argo Floats\n\nArgo is an international collaboration that collects high-quality temperature and salin-\nity profiles from the upper 2000 m of the ice-free global ocean and currents from interme-\ndiate depths. The data come from battery-powered autonomous floats that spend most\nof their life drifting at depth where they are stabilized by being neutrally buoyant at a\n\u201cparking depth\u201d pressure by having a density equal to the ambient pressure and a com-\npressibility that is less than that of sea water. At typically 10-day intervals, the floats\nrise to the surface over about 6 hours while measuring temperature and salinity. Satellites\ndetermine the position of the floats when they surface, and receive the data transmitted\nby the floats. The float then returns to its original density and sinks to drift until the\ncycle is repeated. These data were collected and made freely available by the International\nArgo Program and the national programs that contribute to it (http://www.argo.ucsd.edu,\nhttp://argo.jcommops.org). The Argo Program is part of the Global Ocean Observing Sys-\ntem.\n\n3.2.5 EOF Analysis\n\nThe spatio-temporal variability of modeled and satellite SST was analyzed by means\nof Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF). The EOF analysis consists in a representation\nof the data in terms of a reduced set of orthogonal functions or modes, whose outputs are\nspatial fields and their associated eigenvalues (relative amount of variance) and eigenvec-\ntors (temporal weightings for each time step), allowing to study the temporal and spatial\n\n55\n\n\n\nvariability of data. The EOF eigenvectors and eigenvalues are obtained via singular value\ndecomposition (SVD) (Preisendorfer, 1988). The contribution of one EOF at any time in\na particular point is obtained by multiplying the value at that location times the value of\nthe temporal coefficient at a given instant.\n\nThat is, a variable is considered to be a function f of space and time, computed for\nconstant space and time intervals. The EOF method represents the data as a sum of\nproducts of functions:\n\nf(x, y, z) =\n?\n\nFi(x, y) Gi(t) (3.3)\n\nwhere the Fi express the data distribution in space and the Gi give the contribution of\nthe respective space distribution to f at any given time.\n\nThis methodology can be applied to vectors (e.g. Torres et al., 2003); hence, modeled\nand radar surface currents are also compared through EOF analysis.\n\n3.2.6 Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)\n\nAnother statistical tool used in this study for the Argo floats data is the root mean\nsquare error (RMSE) (Wilks, 2006), which is a computation of the differences between\nmodel and observations. RMSE is given by:\n\nRMSE =\n\n?\n1\n\nn\n\n?\n(Mn ? Dn)2 (3.4)\n\nwhere Mn is the model data, Dn the Argo floats data and n the size of both data series\nand the number of times the comparison is carried out.\n\n3.3 Results Overview\n\nThe first part of the results (section 3.4) consists in an analysis of a long upwelling index\ndataset (1967-2011), already used in the literature (e.g. Alvarez et al., 2008). The purpose\nof this analysis is to set a background of variability for the model essay in the second part\n(section 3.5), which is more limited in time (2001-2011). The longer dataset provides a\nbroader look on the interannual variability, namely of upwelling conditions, whereas the\nmodel shorter period is intended for trying to identify more specific episodes of variability,\nwhich is enabled by the numerical tools.\n\n3.4 Upwelling Index Analysis\n\nThe UI mean seasonal and interannual distribution for each location is shown in Fig-\nure 3.2. It is evident that the strongest upwelling signal takes place between April and\nSeptember, i.e. corresponding to the late spring/summer months, as expected from the\nwell-known behavior of mid-latitude upwelling systems, and in particularly the Iberian\n\n56\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n!1000\n\n!500\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\nl)\n\nS\na\n\ng\nre\n\ns\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n!1000\n\n!500\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\nj)\n\nS\nin\n\ne\ns\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n!1000\n\n!500\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\nh)\n\nC\na\n\nb\no\n\n d\na\n\n R\no\n\nc\na\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n!1000\n\n!500\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\nf)\nF\n\nig\nu\n\ne\nir\na\n\n d\na\n\n F\no\nz\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n!1000\n\n!500\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\nd)\n\nA\nv\ne\n\nir\no\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n!1000\n\n!500\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\nb)\n\nR\nia\n\ns\n B\n\na\nix\n\na\ns\n\na)\n\n2 4 6 8 10 12\n1967\n1973\n1979\n1985\n1991\n1997\n2003\n2009\n\nc)\n\n2 4 6 8 10 12\n1967\n1973\n1979\n1985\n1991\n1997\n2003\n2009\n\ne)\n\n2 4 6 8 10 12\n1967\n1973\n1979\n1985\n1991\n1997\n2003\n2009\n\ng)\n\n2 4 6 8 10 12\n1967\n1973\n1979\n1985\n1991\n1997\n2003\n2009\n\ni)\n\n2 4 6 8 10 12\n1967\n1973\n1979\n1985\n1991\n1997\n2003\n2009\n\nk)\n\n \n\n \n\n2 4 6 8 10 12\n1967\n1973\n1979\n1985\n1991\n1997\n2003\n2009\n\n!1000 !800 !600 !400 !200 0 200 400 600 800 1000\n\nFigure 3.2: Hovmo?ller diagrams of the monthly UI (m3s?1km?1) (left column) and monthly\ndistribution of UI intensity with associated errors (right column) for Rias Baixas (a,b);\nAveiro (c,d); Figueira da Foz (e,f); Cabo da Roca (g,h); Sines (i,j); and Sagres (k,l).\n\n57\n\n\n\nUpwelling System (Wooster et al., 1976; Fiu?za, 1983). Also noteworthy is the similarity\nbetween locations of the UI patterns given by the Hovmo?ller diagrams (left column), al-\nthough they vary in magnitude. In general, years with early upwelling onset are followed\nby years with late upwelling onset, seen by the left-to-right slope of the contours in the\ndiagrams. There are some years that register favorable upwelling conditions during winter\n(February-March), and these are usually the years where the upwelling season lingers on\nuntil October (1973, 1983, 1992, 2000, among others). For instances, 2007 was a year with\na particularly long upwelling season, which lasted from mid-February to mid-November;\nhowever, UI rarely surpassed the magnitudes that characterize strong upwelling events\n(>600 m3s?1km?1). This happens in general for the years of long upwelling seasons, such\nas the ones mentioned before. Curiously, strong El Nin?o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) pos-\nitive events have been registered in the preceding years (1972, 1982 and 1991, according\nto the Climate Prediction Center of NOAA). ENSO has been known to influence the NW\nAfrican upwelling region, where warm ENSO events lead to weaker northerly winds and\ntherefore weaker upwelling (Roy and Reason, 2001).\n\nAs for years of strong downwelling conditions in winter, one can note the periods 1967-\n72 and 1977-78, year 1997, and the period 2001-2005. Pe?rez et al. (2010) also registered\nlow annual mean UI values for these periods in the Rias Baixas location, especially the\nlatter, which corresponds to a negative summer NAO.\n\nThis analysis is reinforced by the seasonal average intensity per region and associated\nerror bars (which were computed taking into account monthly UI values) displayed on\nFigure 3.2, right column. Once again, this seasonal cycle is in agreement with previous\nstudies on the characterization of upwelling seasonality for the western Iberian region (e.g.\nWooster et al., 1976; Go?mez-Gesteira et al., 2008). In general, UI is positive from March\nto September, being strongest in July, and negative from November to February, being\nstrongest in January. Standard deviations are larger during winter months, decreasing\nin summer months, which implies that while in summer (JJA) conditions are always fa-\nvorable for upwelling, in winter (as well as some of the transient months) some years are\nupwelling-favorable and others downwelling-favorable, although the latter prevail. Rias\nBaixas (Figure 3.2 b) presents the lowest positive UI in summer and the highest down-\nwelling conditions in winter. This can be accounted for by the special characteristics of\nnorthwestern Iberian Peninsula (Torres et al., 2003), where the wind is more variable than\non more southern locations, and the jagged estuaries and closed embayments make the\ncoastline less linear. As we move southward, upwelling-favorable conditions intensify and\ndownwelling-favorable weaken. However, it should be noted that the associated errors\nvary on the opposite direction, i.e. they tend to decrease when we move southward. In\nthe southernmost location downwelling conditions in winter are almost non-existing and\npositive UI during summer decreases, with values more similar to the northern locations.\nFrom this figure we draw that the preferential period for favorable upwelling conditions is\nApril to September (AMJJAS), as previously described in the literature (e.g. Fiu?za, 1983).\nTherefore, from this point on, results will be analyzed for these months only.\n\nThe interannual evolution of the mean summer (April to September) UI since 1967 as a\nfunction of latitude is shown on Figure 3.3. Note that, despite the strong variability present,\n\n58\n\n\n\nthe color scale is always positive, that is, it is always upwelling-favorable conditions. From\nthis diagram it is evident that UI has strong interannual variability. The UI signal is highly\nconsistent for each year within the latitudinal range. That is, whether UI is high or low,\nthe same is observed at all latitudes. Maximum values are in general observed between\n39oN and 40oN. At these latitudes the coastline is less meridional than along the rest of\nthe Western Iberian Margin due to the presence of the Estremadura Promontory. This\ntopographic feature may have some influence on the wind direction, usually alongshore.\nThat is why there is recurrent upwelling-associated filament generation, caused by the\nequatorward advection of the cold and fresh upwelled waters that are sometimes enhanced\nby the promontory (Haynes et al., 1993; Oliveira et al., 2009). Hence, the UI is recurrently\nhigher in this area.\n\nUI Apr!Sep year vs latitude\n\n1967 1969 1971 1973 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989\n37\n\n38\n\n39\n\n40\n\n41\n\n42\n\n \n\n \n\n1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011\n37\n\n38\n\n39\n\n40\n\n41\n\n42\n\n100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 650\n\nFigure 3.3: Hovmo?ller diagram of summer UI (m3s?1km?1) (April-September) as a func-\ntion of latitude.\n\nThere are five years where upwelling occurrence is particularly strong: 1977, 1979,\n1991, 1998 and 2002. The 1991 maximum may be related to the early 1990s winter NAO\nmaximum (Santos et al., 2005), which these authors found to be a turning point toward\n\n59\n\n\n\na period of stronger upwelling occurrence, although such strengthening is not evident in\nour results. Peliz et al. (2002) report that in August 1998 western Iberian Peninsula was\nunder constant northerly winds for practically the entire month, likely accounting for the\nstrong signal of that year. On the other hand, there are also five years where upwelling\nepisodes are visibly weak, namely: 1971, 1983, 1985, 1997 and 2003. Nykjaer and Van\nCamp (1994) reported a weak upwelling period in the Canary Upwelling System in 1983-\n84 due to an exceptional strong El Nin?o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the Pacific Ocean\nin the previous year. Furthermore, some of these years show rather an increase of UI with\nincreasing latitude instead of maxima at 39-40oN (e.g. 1983, 1985, 1999, and 2003).\n\n3.5 Model Results\n\nThe following analysis concerns ROMS output from simulations carried out for period\n2001-2011. Before presenting the model results, daily series of the meridional wind at two\nlatitudes are described. Then, model validation and model output analysis is carried out\nin parallel or simultaneously. First, Argo floats provide comparison through ?-S diagrams.\nThen, EOF analysis is applied to surface currents and SST. The observational surface\ncurrents series comprise one year and a half of data, so this dataset serves only as model\nvalidation. Observational SST, on the other hand, obtained from satellite products, is of\nthe same length as that of the model simulations; hence, not only they provide a comparison\nfor the entire study period, but also the SST data is long enough to be valid for analysis.\nTemperature anomaly episodes are identified.\n\nAfterwards, model results are explored through salinity and meridional velocity Hovmo?-\nller diagrams, as a function of longitude and of depth, and through meridional transport\nseries directly compared with wind stress. The meridional transport approach was preferred\nto EOF analysis of the surface currents, although it has been performed (not shown), so that\nthe first hundreds of meters of the water column could be included. These representations\nare intended to identify more specifically strong poleward or equatorward events.\n\n3.5.1 Meridional Wind Stress\n\nFigure 3.4 shows daily meridional wind stress for the 11 years under scope, extracted\nat two latitudes: 43oN and 37.5oN, centered at 9.7oW (for monthly means see Figure 3.13).\nWind stress off WIM is quite weak when comparing to other eastern boundary systems such\nas California, which comprises also an important and strong current system (Di Lorenzo\net al., 2005). For the period 2001-2011 there is no clear tendency of increase or decrease of\nmeridional wind stress, nor are there dramatic changes in signal or intensity, although the\ntime series are punctuated by evident interannual variability. From April to September\n(and in most years also October), equatorward winds prevail, typical of the upwelling\nseason and in agreement with the analysis of section 3.3.\n\nThe northern latitude registers more markedly poleward wind events, while in the\nsouthern latitude prevails an equatorward signal. In years 2001 and 2002 there are recurrent\n\n60\n\n\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n8\n\n9\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n!\n0\n.50\n\n0\n.5\n\n2001\n\na\n)\n\n \n\n \n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n8\n\n9\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n!\n0\n.50\n\n0\n.5\n\n2002\n\nb\n)\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n8\n\n9\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n!\n0\n.50\n\n0\n.5\n\n2003\n\nc\n)\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n8\n\n9\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n!\n0\n.50\n\n0\n.5\n\n2004\n\nd\n)\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n8\n\n9\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n!\n0\n.50\n\n0\n.5\n\n2005\n\ne\n)\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n8\n\n9\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n!\n0\n.50\n\n0\n.5\n\n2006\n\nf)\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n8\n\n9\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n!\n0\n.50\n\n0\n.5\n\n2007\n\ng\n)\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n8\n\n9\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n!\n0\n.50\n\n0\n.5\n\n2008\n\nh\n)\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n8\n\n9\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n!\n0\n.50\n\n0\n.5\n\n2009\n\ni)\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n8\n\n9\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n!\n0\n.50\n\n0\n.5\n\n2010\n\nj)\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n8\n\n9\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n!\n0\n.50\n\n0\n.5\n\n2011\n\nk\n)\n\n 4\n3\n\no\nN\n\n3\n7\n.5\n\no\nN\n\nFigure 3.4: Daily meridional wind stress (N m?2) monthly time series for years 2001 (upper\npanel) to 2011 (lower panel) at 43oN, 9.7oW and 37.5oN, 9.7oW (see Figure 3.1).\n\n61\n\n\n\npoleward episodes in January-March, as well as in 2004 and 2007. For the remaining years,\nJanuary seems the month with the most evident northward signal (e.g. 2009, 2010). In\nautumn (October-December) this tendency is also frequent (e.g. 2002, 2006, 2009, 2010).\n\n3.5.2 ?-S Distribution\n\nIn order to assess the model ability to reproduce hydrography, ?-S diagrams (Figure 3.5)\nwere plotted for the data of all available Argo floats profiles during the study period,\ndivided in three regions (Figure 3.5 a). The values of the ENACW, both subpolar and\nsubtropical branches (gray line and black line in the diagrams, respectively) are reasonably\nwell reproduced by ROMS, especially their salinity minimum of about 35.6. Likewise, the\ndeeper, colder waters (<7oC,&lt;35.7) coincide very well with the Argo data. Surface waters,\non the other hand, present some discrepancy in terms of salinity, with ROMS minus Argo\ndifferences from -0.1 in the northern region to -0.3 in the southern region. Note that the\nsouthern region is where there are the fewest Argo floats profile data and the northern\nregion where there is the most. Model and observations also differ at the MW levels in\nabout -0.1 to -0.2. Both these differences are also observed in the RMSE of ROMS in\ncomparison to Argo (Figure 3.5 c), in the upper 100 m and between 1000 and 1400 m\ndepth. Salinity RMSE reaches 0.2 and 0.25 at these depths, respectively, while throughout\nthe water column values remain close to 0.1 or lower, and temperature RMSE reaches\n1.15 and 1.3, also respectively at those depths, while at the remaining levels values vary\nbetween 0.3 and 0.8. The discrepancy at the MW levels may arise from a displacement of\nthe maximum temperature and salinity associated with MW. This is consistent with the\nclimatological observations of chapter 2. While observations place the MW main core at\n1200 m, ROMS places it at about 1000 m.\n\n3.5.3 Surface Currents\n\nEOF analysis was applied to model and observational surface currents for period July\n2010 to December 2011 (the period of HF-radar data availability); hence, the following\nanalysis concerns ROMS validation only. Figures 3.6 and 3.7 show the first and the second\nmodes of vector EOF of daily values of surface velocity, respectively, for ROMS and for\nHF-radar data.\n\nThe first mode of the real vector EOF represents basically the current meridional com-\nponent. For this domain and time frame, the first mode represents roughly 36% of the\nROMS variability, while it is 56% of the radar variability. Both spatial modes present\nsouth-southwestward vectors (with intensity increasing onshore in ROMS), which means\nthat, for instances, in the case of northerly winds, surface currents are southward with a\nwestward deflection (? 45o) due to the wind-induced Ekman dynamics. Conversely, in the\ncase of southerly wind, the deflection is eastward. The temporal mode for both datasets\nagrees well, except for some overestimation of ROMS.\n\nThe second EOF mode (Figure 3.7) represents the zonal current component. For\nROMS, 16% of the variability is explained by this mode, whereas for radar the value\n\n62\n\n\n\n  12\no\n\nW   10\no\n\nW    8\no\n\nW    6\no\n\nW \n\n  36\no\n\nN \n\n  38\no\n\nN \n\n  40\no\n\nN \n\n  42\no\n\nN \n\n  44\no\n\nN \n\n \n\n \n\nNo. points\n415\n825\n1566\n\na)\n\n35 35.5 36 36.5\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n o: ROMS, x: ARGO\n\n!\n\nS\n\n \n\n \n\n25\n\n2\n\n25.5\n\n25.5\n\n26\n\n26\n\n26\n\n26\n\n26.5\n\n26.5\n\n26.5\n\n27\n\n27\n\n27\n\n27\n\n27.\n5\n\n27.5\n\n27.5\n\n28\n\n28\n\n28\n\n28\n.5\n\n28.\n5\n\n29\n\nNorth\n\nCenter\n\nSouth\n\n (\n\u00ba\nc\n\n)\n\nb)\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n\n!2000\n\n!1800\n\n!1600\n\n!1400\n\n!1200\n\n!1000\n\n!800\n\n!600\n\n!400\n\n!200\n\n0\n\nd\ne\n\np\nth\n\n (\nm\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n\ntemperature RMSE\n\nsalinity RMSE\n\nc)\n\nFigure 3.5: (a) Argo float distribution (number of measurements per region indicated).\nIsobaths 200 m and 1000 m are shown.

The general tendency is for eastward flow, deflected southeastward, reflecting\nEkman drift for a zonal wind. There is still reasonably good agreement between the two\ndatasets.\n\nCombining the two modes, we obtain the two components of the Ekman transport, and\ncan thus analyze the preferential direction of the surface flow. When the temporal modes of\nboth EOFs are positive, the spatial modes result in southward vectors, which occur mostly\nin spring and summer and correspond to the upwelling equatorward jet (June-August\n2011). In the second EOF temporal mode, there is another striking positive episode in\nlate October-early November 2010, to which corresponds a weaker and not always positive\nsignal in the first EOF temporal mode; therefore, the direction of the flow oscillated between\nequatorward or offshore. In September-October and December 2010, both temporal modes\nare negative, hence indicating poleward flow, also occurring less evidently in March and\nNovember 2011. In December 2011 (and early May, although less prominent), the second\ntemporal mode indicates a strong positive event, which counterbalanced by a weak signal\nin the first temporal mode results in onshore surface flow.\n\n64\n\n\n\n0.1 m/s\n\n  10\no\nW    9\n\no\nW \n\n 40\u2019 \n\n  42\no\nN \n\n 20\u2019 \n\n 40\u2019 \n\n  43\no\nN \n\nSpatial mode !

The seasonal cycle was removed, otherwise\nthe first mode of variability would be nothing more than SST seasonality. The first mode\n(Figure 3.8) explains 57% of the variability for the model and approximately 66% for\nthe satellite (without removing the seasonal cycle, this mode would explain > 90% of\nthe variability \u2014 not shown). There is a fairly good agreement between model and\nobservations in the temporal mode, although ROMS tends to overestimate some of the\nvariability peaks, such as in mid-2003, two episodes in 2006 and one at the end of 2008.\nOn the other hand, it achieves a good agreement for the episodes of 2002, 2007 and 2011.\nThe spatial distribution of the first mode shows an offshore gradient, and it is clear that\nthe strongest variability occurs along the coast within the 200-m isobath, the typical band\nof coastal upwelling.\n\nA strong positive signal on the spatial mode multiplied by negative temporal anoma-\nlies in summer can mean intense upwelling events.

The black line is ROMS temporal mode and\nthe gray line is the satellite temporal mode. Isobaths 200 m and 1000 m are shown.\n\nlies, for instances the episode of April 2011, they are usually associated with particularly\nwarm months or, for the summer months, weak upwelling. ROMS spatial mode shows\nsome prominent signals that extend offshore along 39oN, the location of the Estremadura\nPromontory, and 41oN, off Aveiro. In the satellite spatial mode, there is a more general-\nized offshore variability south of 40oN, although there is evidence of protuberances located\nat the latitudes not only of the Estremadura Promontory but also of Cape Finisterre and\nCape St Vincent. These signatures may be related to the generation of upwelling-associated\nfilaments.\n\nFrom the first mode time series, a few strong upwelling signals stand out, e.g. summer\n2002, summer 2007 and autumn 2008. Positive anomalies are more frequent and occur in\nall seasons, sometimes in the same year. In summer (mid-year), there are relevant peaks\nin 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2009, which correspond to years of less upwelling-favorable winds\n(Figure 3.4).

The black line is ROMS temporal mode and\nthe gray line is the satellite temporal mode. Isobaths 200 m and 1000 m are shown.\n\nThe EOF second mode (Figure 3.9) presents the strongest variability in the north-\nwestern corner of the domain, seen by the negative anomalies in the spatial distribution\nof both model and satellite. Conversely, anomalies are positive alongshore WIM within\nroughly the 1000-m isobath. Explained variability is of 10% for ROMS and about 8% for\nthe satellite. The temporal mode shows again some overestimation of variability peaks, for\ninstances the episodes in 2005-2007 and 2011. Negative values of the time series during\nsummer (2003, 2005, 2006-2008) are associated with negative temperature anomalies along\nthe upwelling band, whereas prevailing positive values for e.g. 2009-2011 relate to negative\nSST anomalies in the northern region.\n\nIn the third variability mode (Figure 3.10), explained variability is of 7% for ROMS\nand 5.5% for the satellite. There is a kind of N-S symmetry in the spatial modes; both\nROMS and satellite show negative anomalies along the coast north of 40oN (weaker and\nextended offshore for the latter) and positive anomalies at the southern coast (stronger\nin the satellite). For the temporal mode, there is again some overestimation of peaks\n\n67\n\n\n\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011\n\n!0.1\n\n!0.05\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\nyear\n\n3\nrd\n\n temporal mode\n\n \n\n \n\n  12\no\nW   10\n\no\nW    8\n\no\nW    6\n\no\nW \n\n  36\no\nN \n\n  38\no\nN \n\n  40\no\nN \n\n  42\no\nN \n\n  44\no\nN \n\nmodel spatial mode !

The black line is ROMS temporal mode and\nthe gray line is the satellite temporal mode. Isobaths 200 m and 1000 m are shown.\n\nby ROMS (2005-2007); however, there are also instances where the reverse is observed:\nunderestimation of peaks by ROMS (2004, 2010, 2011). In general, the time series seem to\nagree better than the 2nd mode. Strong positive anomalies can be found in the temporal\nmode for 2005-2007, 2010 and 2011 (summer and summer/autumn), which brings about\nnegative anomalies along NW Iberian Peninsula and positive anomalies south of Portugal.\nSummer negative anomalies around the Galician coast may be associated with filament\ngeneration, which, as stated before, occurs recurrently in this region due to its bathymetric\ncharacteristics (Torres et al., 2003).\n\n3.5.5 Salinity and Meridional Velocity Analysis\n\nFrom here on the analysis is carried out for ROMS output only. The previous EOF\nanalysis is in itself a good method for identifying particular events of SST anomalies. In\naddition, we computed Hovmo?ller diagrams as a function of longitude and of depth (Figures\n\n68\n\n\n\n3.11 and 3.12, respectively), for salinity and meridional velocity, for the entire study period.\nNote that the salinity color scales are different between latitudes: the southern location is\ndisplaced by +0.25 relative to the northern one.\n\nAt 43oN (Figure 3.11 a), three strong fresh events are observed near-shore and offshore\nin early 2001 and 2003, and in late 2006-early 2007, to which correspond poleward velocities\nnearshore (Figure 3.11 b) and fresh signals at 37.5oN (Figure 3.11 c). These events are\nrelated to strong river discharge (not shown), advected offshore through Ekman transport.\nFresh water signals nearshore in the beginning of 2004, 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2011 are most\nlikely associated with winter river discharges from the Galician Rias, whose fresh waters\nusually remain contained within the estuaries. On the other hand, strong episodes of\nhigh salinity are observed in the second halves of 2009-2011, with corresponding poleward\nvelocities (especially 2009), which denotes saline water advection from the south. Note\nthat these years presented marked SST positive anomalies (Figure 3.8), which may indicate\npoleward flow events. Nearshore, equatorward flow prevails in summer at both latitudes,\nand at 43oN there are punctual strong poleward events, usually associated with moderate\nhigh salinity episodes: early and late 2001 (note the very high salinities at 37oN at that\nperiod); mid 2002; mid 2006 (with high salinities more offshore); and early 2008. Some of\nthese episodes have also correspondence to SST warm anomalies (Figure 3.8).\n\nAt 37.5oN (Figure 3.11 c,d), low salinity values have correspondence with evidence of\nintense equatorward flow, especially for the summers of 2001 to 2004, and 2007 to 2009.\nNote that the latter period was characterized by strong UI (Figure 3.3). High salinities and\npoleward velocities occur more frequently along 11oW, mostly in summer, while in winter\nboth episodes are often registered between 9.5o and 10oW. This may constitute evidence\nof offshore displacement of the poleward advection of saline waters during the upwelling\nseason, that in winter occurs closer to the coast. This is apparent, for instances, from 2007\nand 2008, for both variables.\n\nIn the vertical profiles (Figure 3.12), it is easier to identify particular saline/fresh and\npoleward/equatorward events. At 43oN (Figure 3.12 a,b), the saline events of 2009-2011\nare again striking, also with a poleward velocity signature down to 500 m, as well as the\nfresh events of early 2001 and 2003, and late 2006-early 2007. There is an episode of\nsubsurface high salinity and poleward velocity, not evident in Figure 3.11: late 2001-early\n2002, which corresponds to a very strong salinity signal at 37.5oN, consistent with S-N\nsaline water advection. Equatorward strong signals, reaching down to 400-500 m, can be\nfound in early and mid-2005, the second half of 2008 and mid-2011.\n\nAt 37.5oN (Figure 3.12 c,d), salinities above 36 occur at least once a year, mostly cen-\ntered in winter, consistent with the observations in Figure 3.11 between 9.5o and 10oW. The\nyears with strongest poleward events were 2002-2003 (autumn-winter), early 2004, early\nand late 2005, and late 2008. Correspondence with the meridional wind stress distribution\nis less evident; moreover, the circulation here is more influenced by the Mediterranean\nflow at deeper levels (below 500 m). On the other hand, equatorward velocities higher\nthan 0.1 m s?1 are registered in the first halves of 2006, 2009 and 2011, with weaker ver-\ntical signatures. At this latitude, this measurement point (centered at 9.7oW) is farther\nfrom the coast than at 43oN, hence these episodes may not correspond to strong upwelling\n\n69\n\n\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n1\n\n  \n  \n\n2\n0\n\n0\n2\n\n  \n  \n\n2\n0\n\n0\n3\n\n  \n  \n\n2\n0\n\n0\n4\n\n  \n  \n\n 2\n0\n\n0\n5\n\n  \n  \n\n2\n0\n\n0\n6\n\n  \n  \n\n 2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n  \n  \n\n2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n  \n  \n\n2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n  \n  \n\n2\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n  \n  \n\n2\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n \n\n \na)\n\n!10.5 !9.5\n\n35.5 35.75 36\n\n \n\n \nb)\n\n!10.5 !9.5\n\n!0.3 0 0.3\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n1\n\n  \n  \n\n2\n0\n\n0\n2\n\n  \n  \n\n2\n0\n\n0\n3\n\n  \n  \n\n2\n0\n\n0\n4\n\n  \n  \n\n 2\n0\n\n0\n5\n\n  \n  \n\n2\n0\n\n0\n6\n\n  \n  \n\n 2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n  \n  \n\n2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\n  \n  \n\n2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\n  \n  \n\n2\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n  \n  \n\n2\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n \n\n \nc)\n\n!10.5 !9.5\n\n35.75 36 36.25\n\n \n\n \nd)\n\n!10.5 !9.5\n\n!0.3 0 0.3\n\nFigure 3.11: Hovmo?ller diagrams of surface (a,c) salinity; (b,d) and meridional velocity\nv (m s?1) as a function of longitude for latitudes 43oN (left columns) and 37.5oN (right\ncolumns).

Note\nthe salinity minima between 300 and 400 m at both latitudes, the signature of ENACW.\nAlso noteworthy is the barotropic character of the flow, which has also been observed in\nchapter 2.\n\n3.5.6 Meridional Transport\n\nFigure 3.13 presents the wind stress meridional component time series for two points\noff WIM and the meridional transport integrated from the coast to the upper slope down\nto 400 m. In the northern section (Figure 3.13 a), 2001 and 2002 were years with rela-\ntively strong southerly wind episodes in autumn-winter, partially in agreement with the\nHovmo?ller diagrams. The strong saline episodes observed in Figures 3.11 and 3.12 in 2009-\n2011 have transport correspondence, since for those years it is mostly poleward, but not in\nthe meridional wind stress, which indicates these poleward flows are not wind-driven. Other\nyears that have episodes with poleward wind stress > 0.05 N m?2 are March 2003, October\n2006, and February 2008, all of which were observed in Figure 3.11 and/or Figure 3.12 in\nthe velocity profiles. In the remaining years, there is in general equatorward transport in\nsummer, coincident with average northerly winds. For the three intense fresh water events\n(2001, 2003, and 2006-2007), they have correspondence with prevailing poleward winds for\nthose periods.\n\nAt 37.5oN (Figure 3.13 b), both the meridional wind stress and transport time series are\npreferentially equatorward. Among the few exceptions are years 2009-2011, the saline and\npoleward events of the Hovmo?ller diagrams. Strongest equatorward winds (> 0.1 N m?2)\noccur in 2001-2003, 2007, 2008 and 2011, partly consistent with the high UI of Figure 3.3\nand the coastal equatorward velocities (and low salinities) seen in Figure 3.11.\n\n3.6 Discussion\n\na. Upwelling Index\nAn initial brief study of the intra- and interannual variability of Upwelling Index off\n\nwestern Iberian Peninsula was performed taking into account six locations (Rias Baixas,\nAveiro, Figueira da Foz, Cabo da Roca, Sines and Sagres \u2014 Figure 3.1). The data is\ncharacterized by a strong seasonal cycle and a superimposed strong interannual variability,\nin agreement with previous works that have thoroughly described the Iberian Upwelling\nSystem (e.g. Relvas et al., 2007). UI is quite homogeneous along the western coast of the\nIberian Peninsula; strong and weak upwelling signals in different years are observed at all\nlatitudes, although with different intensities.\n\nThese results indicate that large-scale meteorological conditions can explain the largest\nfraction of the variability of upwelling processes in the western coast of Iberia. However,\nit is evident that mesoscale processes also play a significant role in this variability. It\nis suggested that mesoscale processes are rather important in mid-summer, seen by the\nsignificant UI differences from year to year.

The question of\nthe role of mesoscale on upwelling systems has been addressed by previous authors such\nas Di Lorenzo et al. (2005) for the California Current System and by Relvas et al. (2009)\nfor western Iberian Peninsula. The former found, for period 1949-2000, a warming trend\nattributed to surface heating and a strengthening of upwelling-favorable winds, which in\nturn increase current velocities and associated variance. This extra eddy activity, the\nauthors postulate, may have implications in the decadal variability of the system. The\nlatter, considering the different SST trends in the northern and southern coasts of Western\nIberian Peninsula since 1985, attribute the differences to mesoscale activity associated with\nupwelling. This difference is higher for the core summer months (JJA).\n\nTaking into consideration studies in the above-cited literature of interannual variability\nand upwelling trends, the data presented here does not show any clear increase or decrease\nof UI from 1967 to 2011. Figure 3.3 indicates that the 70\u2019s (80\u2019s) were a decade of gener-\nally strong (weak) upwelling events, and that from 1990 on the intensity of UI alternates\nroughly every two years. Bakun (1990) observed similar behavior off Iberian Peninsula at\n43oN, with general high UI in the 70\u2019s and oscillating UI in the 80\u2019s. Even Narayan et\nal. (2010), who have found both strengthening and weakening UI tendencies by analyzing\nseveral yearly-averaged UI time series, observed, for a similar period for a region off NW\nAfrica, more accentuated UI variability after 1990.\n\nb. Model Results\nROMS showed a good performance in reproducing both the hydrography and the sur-\n\nface dynamics, according to the validation analysis that comprised radar surface currents,\nsatellite SST and Argo floats temperature and salinity profiles. There are T and S biases\nin depth similar to those observed in chapter 2, which arise from the differences in the\ndepths where the properties of the Mediterranean Water are found rather than from the\ninability of ROMS to reproduce them. The interannual variability of SST reflected in the\nEOF analysis was well captured, particularly the warm and cold anomaly events given by\nthe first mode.\n\nFrom these short time series of either SST, salinity or meridional wind stress there is no\nevidence of trends. Longer series are necessary to assess the time scales of that variability.\nRuiz-Villarreal et al. (2008) analyzed SST long time series (1900-2006) for the Galician\ncoast and found an increase of roughly 0.1oC decade?1; for a shorter period (1967-2006),\nthe authors report decrease in upwelling-favorable winds in summer. They also trace a\ncorrelation between the variations of the upper layers temperature and salinity and decadal\nvariability, namely the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). In this study, preliminary tests\nconcerning the NAO did not show any evidence of correlation between that index and\neither SST or meridional wind stress times series (including with month lagging).\n\nFrom the combined analysis of salinity and meridional velocity zonal and vertical pro-\nfiles, together with coastal meridional transport and the meridional wind stress, it was\npossible to identify several episodes of saline water northward advection. Years 2009 to\n2011 showed SST warm anomalies, and strong salinity and meridional flow signals, as well\n\n74\n\n\n\nas some tendency for northward transport, which may indicate that there were episodes\nof poleward flow. These events also suggest that salinity has been increasing for the last\nten years, although the time series is not long enough, nor is it possible to validate. Nev-\nertheless, Reboreda et al. (in revision) compared ROMS salinity profiles for period May\n2001-April 2002 with data retrieved at two points along 42oN between 9o and 9.5oW, and\nfound good agreement between results, particularly the salinity event in the beginning of\n2002 that is reported here. Moreover, Amorim et al. (2012) reported high salinities for\nsummer 2010 and 2011 from measurements carried out off Aveiro, at about 41oN.\n\nOther high salinity and poleward flow events have correspondence in the literature:\nOtero et al. (2008) registered strong poleward currents measured by a buoy at approxi-\nmately (42oN, 9.4oW) in November and December 2002; Gago et al. (2011) registered an\nepisode of temperatures above 18oC at the surface on the second half of 2002, and gen-\neralized high salinities throughout 2006 in the upper 100 m. Furthermore, Le Cann and\nSerpette (2009) observed evidences of strong poleward flow in late 2006 and early 2007 in\nthe northern coast of the Iberian Peninsula, with surface temperatures of 17oC, which is\nconsistent with the EOF SST anomalies, although not with the salinity and meridional\nflow profiles.\n\nIn the previous chapter it became evident that the poleward flow is likely a permanent\nfeature of the WIM circulation system, co-existing with upwelling during summer, which\nmeans that it is not driven solely by wind stress, although it can be strengthened by intense\npoleward events. The notion that poleward flow shifts offshore during the upwelling season\nwas further suggested by these results, particularly from Figure 3.11.\n\nIn what concerns upwelling events, there is relatively good agreement between the\nvertical Hovmo?ller diagrams (Figure 3.12), the UI time series (Figure 3.3) and in the\nmonthly-averaged wind stress (Figure 3.13). This is expectable, since UI is computed from\nwind stress, and upwelling is strongly dependent on wind. Furthermore, ROMS was able\nto reproduce the strong fresh water input of particularly intense river discharge events in\n2001, 2003 and 2006-2007.\n\n75\n\n\n\n76\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nModel-derived Connectivity Patterns\nalong the Western Iberian Margin: a\nLagrangian Approach\n\n4.1 Overview\n\nThe study of larval connectivity allows for a better understanding of marine species dy-\nnamics, in particular in such coastal ecosystems as the WIM. Coastal ocean processes play\na fundamental role in the life cycle of numerous marine species, from crustaceans to small\npelagic fish. Hence, it is important to understand how their variability and/or long-term\nchanges affect(s) and/or bound(s) the development and survival of larvae. Larval dispersal\nis crucial in the life cycle of these species, since it dictates the supply of larvae from one\nlocation to the next, the ability of retention of a given location, and even the mortality and\nthe migration success. Understanding these patterns is also important in terms of coastal\nmanagement and biodiversity conservation measures. Among the factors that contribute\nfor the offshore transport of larvae are upwelling filaments and other mesoscale phenomena,\nthe upwelling front itself, the dynamics of the WIBP and species-specific larval behavior\n(Nolasco et al., 2013b).\n\nLarval dispersal and supply may be quantified to a certain degree through connectivity.\nConnectivity of marine populations consists in assessing the connection between spawning\nlocations and settlement locations, the traveling distance for settlement and the fraction\nof settled larvae at given locations (Kim and Barth, 2011). This successful settlement of\nlarvae is called recruitment, which usually means that when larvae arrive at a given location\nconditions are prone for that larvae to develop and reach the adult stage (Domingues et\nal., 2011).\n\nNumerical models have helped to overcome the inherent difficulties of monitoring such\ncomplex dynamics, in particular Lagrangian models coupled to regional ocean configu-\nrations (Marta-Almeida et al., 2006; Peliz et al., 2007). Taking advantage of this work\nhigh-resolution domain configuration for the WIM, this chapter comprises an effort to\n\n77\n\n\n\nstudy these different quantities (supply, accumulation, connectivity) for this region, fol-\nlowing the work of Nolasco et al. (2013b). While these authors performed a study focused\non a specific species, and where the larvae supply locations were set at the main estu-\naries along the WIM, this approach is more generic in the sense that larvae are treated\nmore as Lagrangian particles, and recruitment is allowed to occur at any location along\nthe WIM, not only in estuaries. Two simulations were carried out: one with no imposed\nvertical migration or travel distance limitations, either horizontal or in depth, much like\nthe Lagrangian application in section 2.6; the other where particles have diel vertical mo-\ntion (DVM), that is, they migrate down to 60 m during the day, for protection against\npredators, and up to the surface/subsurface during the night, for feeding (Santos et al.,\n2008). In this light, for the case of DVM, larvae are restricted to the upper 60 m.\n\nHence, this chapter describes connectivity along the WIM of generic larvae for adjacent\nlocations with equal areas. This is carried out numerically for years 2001 to 2011, that is,\nthe Lagrangian model runs over the ROMS simulations forced by real data for that period,\ndescribed in chapter 3. The purpose of this application is not only to assess the influence\nof vertical displacement on dispersal distances and accumulation rates, but also to relate\nthe patterns of dispersal/accumulation and connectivity with strong/weak wind episodes\nand upwelling events, the presence of topographic or bathymetric features, estuaries, etc.\n\n4.2 Data and Methodology\n\nAs previously mentioned, the adopted methodology is built from that of Nolasco et al.\n(2013b), whose approach was already validated in the work of Domingues et al. (2012).\nHowever, mortality and growth rates dependent on temperature and salinity were not taken\ninto account, since they are specific of specific species. Recruitment is assumed to occur\nwhen a larva enters one of the defined areas, which means that conditions such as the\nlarval stage or other information that may influence successful settlement of larvae are not\nconsidered.\n\n4.2.1 ROMS Configuration\n\nThe ROMS configuration used for this study is the same as in chapter 3, described in\nsection 3.2.2. The real forcing for period 2001-2011 was retrieved from the NCEP2 air-\nsea fluxes (www.ncep.noaa.gov) and QuikSCAT/ASCAT reanalysis satellite winds from\nCERSAT (cersat.ifremer.fr). Boundary conditions were provided by the World Ocean\nAtlas (Antonov et al., 2010; Locarnini et al., 2010).\n\n4.2.2 Lagrangian Model\n\nThe Lagrangian model, IBM (Individual Based Model), used in this chapter is the same\nas the one used in section 2.6, and is described therein (subsection 2.6.1). However, while\nin section 2.6 IBM ran over ROMS climatological run (described throughout chapter 2),\n\n78\n\n\n\nhere it runs over the ROMS simulation forced by realistic winds, which period spans from\n2001 to 2011, as described in chapter 3.\n\n4.2.3 Methodology\n\n  12\no\nW   10\n\no\nW    8\n\no\nW    6\n\no\nW \n\n  36\no\nN \n\n  38\no\nN \n\n  40\no\nN \n\n  42\no\nN \n\n  44\no\nN \n\n!!

Isobaths 200 m and 2000 m are shown in black and 1000 m in gray.\nGreen stars indicate wind stress measurement points of Figure 4.2.\n\nFigure 4.1 shows the 89 areas where the Lagrangian particles simulating larvae are\nmeasured, in terms of supply sources and sinks (the term \u201csource\u201d and \u201csink\u201d will be\nproperly defined in the following subsection). Some prominent regions of the WIM (capes,\n\n79\n\n\n\nestuaries, . . . ) are indicated for an easier identification when interpreting. Each area is\ndefined taking 5 grid points cross-shore, seaward from the land mask, and 4 grid points\nalongshore, which means that each area is approximately 15 km \u00d7 12 km. This area\ncorresponds approximately to the area of influence of a typical river plume (Nolasco et\nal., 2013b). For computational viability, and each area having 4 alongshore points by\n5 offshore points, larvae emission is done in only 2 out of each 4 sets of 5 points, which\nmeans 10 out of 20 grid points. Recruitment, on the other hand, is measured in the total\narea. Deployment is done at 3 different levels \u2014 3 m, 5 m and 7 m \u2014 every 5 days\nduring 3 months: February, March and April, which is the beginning of larval season for\nmany marine species, and before the beginning of the upwelling season. Trajectories are\nregistered every 3 hours for 40 days; however, the analysis is carried out after 30 days of\ntravel, that is, for the last 10 days of the trajectory. Thirty is the typical number of days\nthat takes some marine species (e.g. shore crabs) to reach the next stage of development,\nand after which they are known to recruit (Domingues et al., 2011). This means that, for\ninstances, for the particles that are deployed March 31, their source/sink capabilities are\nanalyzed for the first 10 days of May. The total number of particles deployed is 89 areas\n\u00d7 10 grid points \u00d7 3 levels \u00d7 19 time steps = 50,730.\n\nAlthough these areas are defined west of 6.5oW, which means that there is also emis-\nsion/retention at part of the northern and southern coasts of the Iberian Peninsula (see\nFigure 4.1), the analysis carried out in terms of supply from source and to sink in the\nfollowing section concerns the western coast only. The reason for this is that the focus of\nthis work is the WIM alone. On the other hand, the WIM cannot be looked at in terms\nof departure and arrival of particles without taking into account these neighboring areas,\nas if it were detached completely. Thus, the northern and southern coasts are allowed to\nsupply and to recruit larvae; they are merely not computed when quantifying for the WIM.\nFurthermore, Nolasco et al. (2013b) estimated that the contribution of larvae supplying\noutside the domain to the north and south through the eastern boundaries is negligible,\nas should be the contribution of larvae supplying at the WIM with origin at the same\nboundaries. This is valid for the entire set of analyses except for the connectivity matrix,\ndescribed below.\n\n4.2.4 Data Analysis\n\nIn order to describe the dispersal and connectivity process, some concepts related to\ndispersal and accumulation of larvae must be introduced. Dispersal kernel, dispersal from\nsource or supply from source refers to the process of transport of larvae away from each\ndefined area along the coast. Conversely, accumulation kernel, accumulation to sink or\nsupply to sink refers to the process of transport of larvae recruiting into an area.\n\nDispersal/accumulation kernels convey the frequency distribution of distances of disper-\nsal/accumulation. Idealistically (homogeneous ocean, linear coast, symmetrical currents,\n. . . ), dispersal kernels would obey the Gaussian distribution, supplying the most to or from\nnear itself or adjacent locations, and this supply decreasing as the distances increase. An-\nother way to measure supply to and from a location is to represent the percentage of larvae\n\n80\n\n\n\nrecruited as a function of distance between sources/sinks. In this study, source and sink\nare operational terms that designate whether an area is \u201cemitting\u201d or \u201creceiving\u201d larvae,\nand competent larvae refers to larvae that successfully recruit into any area.\n\nIn the present study, one of the aims was to study the inter-annual and spatial patterns\nof connectivity. To this end, square connectivity matrices were computed. A connectivity\nmatrix is defined as the probability matrix of exchange of individuals between sites (Cowen\net al., 2006). These matrices describe the annual accumulated supply of competent larvae\nfrom source area i (i = 1 to k) to sink area j (j = 1 to l):\n\nCy =\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\nC1,1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 C1,l\n...\n\n...\n...\n\nCk,1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Ck,l\n\n?\n\n?\n? (4.1)\n\nIn matrices Cy, each element was normalized by the total number of larvae that orig-\ninated from all areas. These matrices formed the basis to calculate a series of descriptors\nof the dispersal and connectivity processes.\n\nAnnual supply from each source area was defined as the number of larvae originating\nin that area that successfully recruited into any area, normalized by the total number of\nlarvae deployed. This was calculated as the sum of the respective i line of matrix Cy:\n\nSsource(yi) =\nl?\n\nj=1\n\nCi,j (4.2)\n\nSimilarly, annual supply to each sink area was defined as the number of larvae that\nrecruit into that area independently of the source area, also normalized by the total number\nof larvae deployed, and calculated as the sum of the respective j column of matrix Cy:\n\nSsink(yj) =\nk?\n\ni=1\n\nCi,j (4.3)\n\nAdditionally, net supply to each area was computed as the difference between supply\nfrom and supply to that area:\n\nNetsupply(yi) = Ssource(yi) ? Ssink(yi) (4.4)\n\nPositive values of net supply for position yi mean that yi is predominantly a source (it\nsupplies more than it recruits), and for negative values yi is a better sink (it recruits more\nthan it supplies).\n\nThe dispersal kernels describe particle dispersal as the probability density function\n[P(x)] of the number of particles that recruit as a function of distance from the source.\nThey were standardized by dividing each element by the total number of larvae that were\nproduced by that area and that recruited subsequently. This resulted in an annual dispersal\nkernel for each source area centered on 0 km and describing the probabilities of supply for\nthe other equally spaced areas. Finally, the ensemble of source areas was averaged in order\n\n81\n\n\n\nto obtain annual coast-wide dispersal kernels. Since flow along the coast is not stationary,\nleading to non-uniform dispersal along the coast, and because each area receives larvae\nfrom multiple sources, it was also interesting to describe the dispersal distances travelled\nby larvae that were supplied to each population. Therefore, accumulation kernels were also\ncalculated as the distribution of these dispersal distances, in a similar way to the dispersal\nkernels but standardizing by dividing each element of the kernel by the total number of\nlarvae that recruited into that area.\n\nIn the above calculations, distances travelled northward were always defined as positive\ndistances, and distances travelled southward as negative distances. Connectivity matrices,\ndispersal and accumulation kernels and supply from source and to sink areas were calculated\nfor the 11-year period by averaging the annual values.\n\n4.3 Results\n\n4.3.1 Wind Stress Patterns\n\nFigure 4.2 presents the wind stress meridional component for all years under scope at\nthree points off WIM (43oN, 40oN and 37.5oN, at longitude 9.7oW, marked in Figure 4.1),\nfor the months where larvae is deployed and/or supply is computed \u2014 February to June.\nThe average of all years is also shown.\n\nBesides the evident interannual variability, it is interesting to remark that depending\non the latitude, meridional wind episodes are different, especially in what concerns point\n40oN in comparison with the other two. For instances, in 2004 there is a positive peak in\nearly April that is much stronger at 40oN; the same occurs for a negative peak in early\nMarch 2008. On the other hand, in 2011, in late February there is a positive maximum\nat 40oN, whereas for the other latitudes the meridional wind stress is negative and not\nparticularly strong. Another noteworthy aspect is the fact that in June there are not\nwell-defined equatorward winds yet, although they are in general negative.\n\nIn general, equatorward winds prevail over poleward winds; however, the more spo-\nradic poleward events tend to be stronger than the recurrent equatorward patterns. The\nstrongest poleward episodes occur usually in February (2001-2003, 2007, 2010, 2011), but\nmay also occur in March and April (2001, 2003, 2004-2006). The years with less relevant\npoleward peaks are 2008 and 2009. Important equatorward episodes can occur roughly in\nevery considered month, depending on the year.\n\n4.3.2 Dispersal and Accumulation Kernels\n\nFigures 4.3 and 4.4 present dispersal and accumulation kernels (annual averages), for\nboth runs (with and without DVM). For the dispersal kernels, positive distances mean\nsupply to the north, and for the accumulation kernels positive distances mean supply from\nthe south. That is, the south-north direction is always positive. Furthermore, the sink\ndistributions are very similar to those of the source, as it should be, since if in average a\n\n82\n\n\n\nFe\nb\n\nM\nar\n\nAp\nr\n\nM\nay\n\nJu\nn\n\n!0\n.4\n\n!0\n.200.\n2\n\n0.\n4\n\n0.\n6\n\n!\ny\n (N/m\n\n2\n)\n\n20\n01\n\nFe\nb\n\nM\nar\n\nAp\nr\n\nM\nay\n\nJu\nn\n\n!0\n.4\n\n!0\n.200.\n2\n\n0.\n4\n\n0.\n6\n\n!\ny\n (N/m\n\n2\n)\n\n20\n02\n\nFe\nb\n\nM\nar\n\nAp\nr\n\nM\nay\n\nJu\nn\n\n!0\n.4\n\n!0\n.200.\n2\n\n0.\n4\n\n0.\n6\n\n!\ny\n (N/m\n\n2\n)\n\n20\n03\n\nFe\nb\n\nM\nar\n\nAp\nr\n\nM\nay\n\nJu\nn\n\n!0\n.4\n\n!0\n.200.\n2\n\n0.\n4\n\n0.\n6\n\n!\ny\n (N/m\n\n2\n)\n\n20\n04\n\nFe\nb\n\nM\nar\n\nAp\nr\n\nM\nay\n\nJu\nn\n\n!0\n.4\n\n!0\n.200.\n2\n\n0.\n4\n\n0.\n6\n\n!\ny\n (N/m\n\n2\n)\n\n20\n05\n\nFe\nb\n\nM\nar\n\nAp\nr\n\nM\nay\n\nJu\nn\n\n!0\n.4\n\n!0\n.200.\n2\n\n0.\n4\n\n0.\n6\n\n!\ny\n (N/m\n\n2\n)\n\n20\n06\n\nFe\nb\n\nM\nar\n\nAp\nr\n\nM\nay\n\nJu\nn\n\n!0\n.4\n\n!0\n.200.\n2\n\n0.\n4\n\n0.\n6\n\n!\ny\n (N/m\n\n2\n)\n\n20\n07\n\nFe\nb\n\nM\nar\n\nAp\nr\n\nM\nay\n\nJu\nn\n\n!0\n.4\n\n!0\n.200.\n2\n\n0.\n4\n\n0.\n6\n\n!\ny\n (N/m\n\n2\n)\n\n20\n08\n\nFe\nb\n\nM\nar\n\nAp\nr\n\nM\nay\n\nJu\nn\n\n!0\n.4\n\n!0\n.200.\n2\n\n0.\n4\n\n0.\n6\n\n!\ny\n (N/m\n\n2\n)\n\n20\n09\n\nFe\nb\n\nM\nar\n\nAp\nr\n\nM\nay\n\nJu\nn\n\n!0\n.4\n\n!0\n.200.\n2\n\n0.\n4\n\n0.\n6\n\n!\ny\n (N/m\n\n2\n)\n\n20\n10\n\nFe\nb\n\nM\nar\n\nAp\nr\n\nM\nay\n\nJu\nn\n\n!0\n.4\n\n!0\n.200.\n2\n\n0.\n4\n\n0.\n6\n\n!\ny\n (N/m\n\n2\n)\n\n20\n11\n\nFe\nb\n\nM\nar\n\nAp\nr\n\nM\nay\n\nJu\nn\n\n!0\n.4\n\n!0\n.200.\n2\n\n0.\n4\n\n0.\n6\n\n!\ny\n (N/m\n\n2\n)\n\nAv\ner\n\nag\ne\n\n \n\n \n 4\n\n3o\nN\n\n 4\n0o\n\nN\n\n37\n.5\n\no N\n\nFigure 4.2: Daily wind stress meridional component (N m?2) time series for years 2001-\n2011 and period February-June at three points off WIM marked in green stars in Figure 4.1.\n\n83\n\n\n\nsource supplies, for instances, to a northern (southern) location 10 km away, it is supplied in\naverage from a southern (northern) location 10 km away. The strong interannual variability\nis striking.\n\nIn some years supply is done mostly to the south (2002, 2004, 2009, and also 2006 and\n2007, discussed further below) and from short distances, and we see that 2009 was a year\nwhere winds were predominantly equatorward and with few strong episodes (Figure 4.2 i),\nconsistent with short displacements. In other years, particles travel longer distances (2001,\n2008, 2010). In these years there are long periods of consistent winds: in 2001, after\na month and a half of strong poleward winds, equatorward winds prevail between April\nand June, hence the long distances travelled in both directions; in 2008, there are rarely\npoleward episodes, thus promoting generalized southward transport; in 2010, there are\nmostly poleward winds, at least at 43oN and 40oN, accounting for the marked northward\ndispersal.\n\nThe cases of 2006 and 2007 are quite interesting, with an abrupt change at distance zero.\nObserving the dispersal (accumulation) kernels \u2014 Figure 4.3 f,g (Figure 4.4 f,g) \u2014 , on one\nhand there is a higher supply to the south (from the north) at shorter distances, and on the\nother supply to the north (from the south), although lower, reaches farther locations. In\nterms of winds (Figure 4.2 f,g), 2006 has an important poleward episode in March, while\nin 2007 several poleward peaks take place throughout February, promoting northward\ntransport, both followed by consistent equatorward winds, lasting several months, which\nexplains the large distribution to the south (from the north).\n\nThe most evident difference between distributions with and without DVM is the shift\ntoward supply to the south (from the north). This shift is visible in almost all years, clearly\nin 2004, 2007 and 2009, but also in 2003, 2005 and 2011, where the protuberance toward\nsupplies to the north (from the south) are softened and the distribution becomes more\nsymmetric around zero. The shift is also visible from the mean and standard deviation of\nthe distributions (indicated in black and red at each side of the plot).\n\nIn the end, the mean distribution is mostly symmetrical (Figure 4.3, 4.4 last subplot),\nwith a central peak that suggests self-recruitment (or in adjacent areas) and an exponential\ndecrease toward farther distances. Nolasco et al. (2013b) results were more consistent with\nthis kind of distribution for each year, which means that there was higher self-recruitment\nand that populations tended to supply to/from adjacent locations. Furthermore, the im-\nposition of DVM does not mean higher self-recruitment as could be expected, since the\nvertical migration of larvae could inhibit advection offshore and promote retention near\ntheir origin.\n\n4.3.3 Supply from Source and to Sink\n\nFigures 4.5 and 4.6 show the total annual supply from each source and to each sink,\nrespectively (the last subplot is the 11-year mean), for DVM and no DVM simulations.\nThere is some interannual variability, but overall all areas are able to supply. However,\nit seems that Tejo and Sado are systematically the \u201cworst\u201d sources, particularly seen in\nyears 2007 to 2009. Note that the extremities of the western Iberian coast are also weak\n\n84\n\n\n\n!\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n.0\n\n2\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n7\n5\n\n0\n.1\n\ny\n =\n\n 4\n3\n\ns\n =\n\n 8\n3\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n1\n\ny\n =\n\n !\n2\n\n6\ns\n =\n\n 3\n2\n\nS\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n N\n\nP(x)\n\n!\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n.0\n\n2\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n7\n5\n\n0\n.1\n\ny\n =\n\n !\n2\n\n5\ns\n =\n\n 2\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n2\n\ny\n =\n\n !\n6\n\n7\ns\n =\n\n 4\n4\n\nS\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n N\n\n!\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n.0\n\n2\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n7\n5\n\n0\n.1\n\ny\n =\n\n 5\n6\n\ns\n =\n\n 6\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n3\n\ny\n =\n\n 1\n7\n\ns\n =\n\n 5\n0\n\nS\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n N\n\n!\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n.0\n\n2\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n7\n5\n\n0\n.1\n\ny\n =\n\n !\n5\n\n6\ns\n =\n\n 2\n8\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n4\n\ny\n =\n\n !\n1\n\n0\n4\n\ns\n =\n\n 3\n6\n\nS\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n N\n\nP(x)\n\n!\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n.0\n\n2\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n7\n5\n\n0\n.1\n\ny\n =\n\n 1\n5\n\ns\n =\n\n 1\n8\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n5\n\ny\n =\n\n 1\ns\n =\n\n 2\n3\n\nS\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n N\n\n!\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n.0\n\n2\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n7\n5\n\n0\n.1\n\ny\n =\n\n 9\ns\n =\n\n 4\n7\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n6\n\ny\n =\n\n !\n2\n\n4\ns\n =\n\n 2\n4\n\nS\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n N\n\n!\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n.0\n\n2\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n7\n5\n\n0\n.1\n\ny\n =\n\n !\n2\n\n4\ns\n =\n\n 7\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\ny\n =\n\n !\n8\n\n4\ns\n =\n\n 3\n6\n\nS\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n N\n\nP(x)\n\n!\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n.0\n\n2\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n7\n5\n\n0\n.1\n\ny\n =\n\n !\n5\n\n3\ns\n =\n\n 2\n1\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\ny\n =\n\n !\n5\n\n9\ns\n =\n\n 2\n0\n\nS\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n N\n\n!\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n.0\n\n2\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n7\n5\n\n0\n.1\n\ny\n =\n\n !\n7\n\n7\ns\n =\n\n 4\n3\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n9\n\ny\n =\n\n !\n8\n\n4\ns\n =\n\n 3\n3\n\nS\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n N\n\n!\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n.0\n\n2\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n7\n5\n\n0\n.1\n\ny\n =\n\n 9\n4\n\ns\n =\n\n 5\n9\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n0\n\ny\n =\n\n 6\n8\n\ns\n =\n\n 5\n5\n\nD\nis\n\nta\nn\n\nc\ne\n\n (\nk\nm\n\n)\nS\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n N\n\nP(x)\n\n!\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n.0\n\n2\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n7\n5\n\n0\n.1\n\ny\n =\n\n 2\n6\n\ns\n =\n\n 2\n6\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n1\n\ny\n =\n\n 5\ns\n =\n\n 2\n8\n\nD\nis\n\nta\nn\n\nc\ne\n\n (\nk\nm\n\n)\nS\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n N\n\n!\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n.0\n\n2\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n7\n5\n\n0\n.1\n\nM\ne\n\na\nn\n\n d\nis\n\np\ne\n\nrs\na\n\nl \nk\ne\n\nrn\ne\n\nl\n\ny\n =\n\n 7\ns\n =\n\n 2\n4\n\ny\n =\n\n !\n2\n\n7\ns\n =\n\n 1\n8\n\nD\nis\n\nta\nn\n\nc\ne\n\n (\nk\nm\n\n)\nS\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n N\n\n \n\n \n\nn\no\n\n D\nV\n\nM\n\n D\nV\n\nM\n\nFigure 4.3: Dispersal kernels (the mean and standard deviation are shown).

The black\ndistribution corresponds to the case of no DVM, and the red distribution to the case of\nDVM.\n\n86\n\n\n\nsources. In the case of DVM, the supply increases throughout, especially north of Peniche.\nWith the introduction of vertical migration, particles spend more time below the surface\nEkman layer, avoiding offshore dispersion during upwelling, and thus improving the ability\nof successful recruitment.\n\nIn what concerns supply to sinks, there are more marked differences between locations.\nThe areas that seem to retain more are Peniche, Tejo, and Sado, and once again the\nextremities of the western Iberian coast. The reason for these regions to be good sinks\nmay be the fact that they are all located adjacent to capes or promontories, which may\nenable them to retain arriving particles. On the other hand, they were observed to be\nweak sources, likely due to the same reason. In the case of DVM, the tendency for good\nretention is enhanced, particularly near pronounced topography features.\n\nFigure 4.7 shows the balance between supply to and from each location. Positive\nvalues mean that supply is greater than accumulation and negative values mean that\naccumulation is greater than supply. Therefore, zero balance does not usually mean that\nthere is neither supply nor accumulation; rather that supply is equal to accumulation. The\ngeneral tendency indicates that the areas between capes Finisterre and Corrubedo (the\nnorthernmost regions, see Figure 4.1) are good sinks, whereas the northwest from ria da\nArousa to north of the Estremadura Promontory (that is, where the coastline is mostly\nmeridional), holds the best sources. Between Peniche and Tejo there is also a tendency\nfor more supplying than accumulation (the coastline is again mostly meridional), but at\nTejo and Sado there is preferentially accumulation, as previously seen. South of Sado\nthere is again more tendency for supplying, with the exception of the two southernmost\nlocations near Cape St Vincent. Therefore, we conclude that there are better conditions\nfor larvae sources in regions where the coastline is smoother and straight, and better\nconditions for larvae sinks where the coastline is more jagged and protuberant. Once\nagain, the introduction of vertical displacement of larvae tends to enhance both supply\nand accumulation. The locations where the differences between DVM and no DVM are\nthe extremities: north of ria de Arousa and south of Mira.\n\nIt is interesting to remark that Nolasco et al. (2013b) found that for instances Aveiro\nwas a good sink and a weak source, conversely to these results. However, since in that\nstudy the locations for recruitment were limited to the estuaries, a possible explanation for\nthis difference is the fact that in order for Aveiro to successfully supply southward was if\nthat recruitment were done in Mondego or Tejo, with no sink in between, over the 150 km\nthat separate these two locations. In this approach, Aveiro can supply to much closer\nlocations, becoming a more successful source than sink.\n\n4.3.4 Dispersal Distances\n\nFigure 4.8 (4.9) presents the dispersal distance of particles supplied to (from) each\narea according to the alongshore location of all areas when functioning as sources (sinks).\nIn Figure 4.8, positive (negative) distances indicate particles being supplied to the north\n(south), while in Figure 4.9 positive (negative) distances mean that particles are being\nsupplied from the south (north).

The black distribution corresponds to the case of no DVM,\nand the red distribution to the case of DVM. The black distribution corresponds to the\ncase of no DVM, and the red distribution to the case of DVM. Labels in gray in the first\nplot correspond to the regions identified in Figure 4.1.\n\n90\n\n\n\nis computed in time. The last subplot is the 11-year mean. In all these figures, there is a\ncrucial area for change in behavior, which is the region between Peniche and Tejo (between\napproximately 630 and 730 km in terms of alongshore position of source/sink) \u2014 the\nEstremadura Promontory (EP).\n\nLike in the supply analysis, dispersal distance undergoes strong interannual variability.\nAnalyzing the case with no DVM, in terms of source location (Figure 4.8), there are\nseveral years where north of Peniche/Tejo particles are supplied to the north, and south of\nPeniche/Tejo they are supplied to the south (2001, 2003, 2010, and less evidently in 2006\nand 2007), and this is reflected on the 11-year mean, while in other years it is not so clear.\nIn some years, the particle dispersal is mostly southward (2004, with the exception of Tejo\nand Sado, 2008 and 2009, also visible in 2002, but very close to zero, with the exception\nof the EP region); in others it is preferentially northward (2005, 2011). In 2005, however,\ndispersal distances are near zero, except in the EP, while in 2011 distances to the north\ndown to Aveiro are positive, near zero from Aveiro to Sado, and positive again to the south,\nalthough much weaker. As suggested in the previous figures, DVM enhances supply to the\nsouth in the region north of Peniche (e.g. 2001, 2002, 2004, 2007), as seen in the average\n(last subplot). In the southern WIM differences between DVM and no DVM are negligible.\nA possible explanation for this follows. DVM increases southward recruitment in general.\nNorth of Peniche, since recruitment was carried out preferentially northward, the difference\nis more evident than south of Peniche, where recruitment was already preferentially to the\nsouth.\n\nWhen observing dispersal distances according to the sink (Figure 4.9), there is more\nagreement interannually, and also between the cases with and without DVM: particles are\nsupplied from the south in northern WIM and from the north in southern WIM. Here,\nthe transition between supply origin (the geographical gap) is north of the Estremadura\nPromontory, between Mondego and Peniche (and sometimes even farther north). The more\nevident exceptions are years 2002, 2004, 2008 and 2009, where the particles retained were\nsupplied mostly from the north. However, in average (last subplot), tendencies are for\npositive retention north of Aveiro, negative retention south of Aveiro, and close to zero\nsouth of Sado. Differences between the cases with and without DVM are not significant\nbecause, although dispersal distances are greater, they increase in both directions, and so\nthe balance remains similar to the case without DVM (only slightly enhanced southward,\nas expected). Since there are few larvae supplied from south of Tejo that go northward,\nthe regions between Aveiro and Tejo are not much supplied from the south. Even in years\nwhere particle dispersal is mostly northward, there is a decrease between Peniche and Tejo.\n\nAs previously observed in Figures 4.3 and 4.4, the existence of DVM enhances southward\ntransport. From these figures it can be drawn that this happens mostly north of the EP.\nThe EP is an evident geographical obstacle for larvae transport. It is interesting to note\nthat, from the source point of view, the gap takes place between Peniche and Tejo, whereas\nfrom the sink point of view it occurs between Mondego and Peniche. That is, generally\nspeaking, for years where dispersal occurs on opposite directions relative to the EP, supply\nnorth of Peniche (north of Mondego) is carried out to the north (from the south), and\nvice-versa. When introducing DVM, supply is carried out farther to the south in northern\n\n91\n\n\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n3\n0\n0\n\n4\n0\n0\n\n5\n0\n0\n\n6\n0\n0\n\n7\n0\n0\n\n8\n0\n0\n\n9\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n0\n0\n\n!\n1\n0\n00\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n\nDispersal distance \n\n2\n0\n0\n1\n\nAro\n\nMin\n\nDou\n\nAve\n\nMon\n\nPen\n\nTej\nSad\n\nMir\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n3\n0\n0\n\n4\n0\n0\n\n5\n0\n0\n\n6\n0\n0\n\n7\n0\n0\n\n8\n0\n0\n\n9\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n0\n0\n\n!\n1\n0\n00\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n3\n0\n0\n\n4\n0\n0\n\n5\n0\n0\n\n6\n0\n0\n\n7\n0\n0\n\n8\n0\n0\n\n9\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n0\n0\n\n!\n1\n0\n00\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n3\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n3\n0\n0\n\n4\n0\n0\n\n5\n0\n0\n\n6\n0\n0\n\n7\n0\n0\n\n8\n0\n0\n\n9\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n0\n0\n\n!\n1\n0\n00\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n\nDispersal distance \n\n2\n0\n0\n4\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n3\n0\n0\n\n4\n0\n0\n\n5\n0\n0\n\n6\n0\n0\n\n7\n0\n0\n\n8\n0\n0\n\n9\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n0\n0\n\n!\n1\n0\n00\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n5\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n3\n0\n0\n\n4\n0\n0\n\n5\n0\n0\n\n6\n0\n0\n\n7\n0\n0\n\n8\n0\n0\n\n9\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n0\n0\n\n!\n1\n0\n00\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n6\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n3\n0\n0\n\n4\n0\n0\n\n5\n0\n0\n\n6\n0\n0\n\n7\n0\n0\n\n8\n0\n0\n\n9\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n0\n0\n\n!\n1\n0\n00\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n\nDispersal distance \n\n2\n0\n0\n7\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n3\n0\n0\n\n4\n0\n0\n\n5\n0\n0\n\n6\n0\n0\n\n7\n0\n0\n\n8\n0\n0\n\n9\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n0\n0\n\n!\n1\n0\n00\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n8\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n3\n0\n0\n\n4\n0\n0\n\n5\n0\n0\n\n6\n0\n0\n\n7\n0\n0\n\n8\n0\n0\n\n9\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n0\n0\n\n!\n1\n0\n00\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n9\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n3\n0\n0\n\n4\n0\n0\n\n5\n0\n0\n\n6\n0\n0\n\n7\n0\n0\n\n8\n0\n0\n\n9\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n0\n0\n\n!\n1\n0\n00\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n\nA\nlo\n\nn\ng\n s\n\nh\no\nre\n\n p\no\nsi\n\ntio\nn\n o\n\nf \nso\n\nu\nrc\n\ne\n (\n\nkm\n)\n\nDispersal distance \n\n2\n0\n1\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n3\n0\n0\n\n4\n0\n0\n\n5\n0\n0\n\n6\n0\n0\n\n7\n0\n0\n\n8\n0\n0\n\n9\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n0\n0\n\n!\n1\n0\n00\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n\nA\nlo\n\nn\ng\n s\n\nh\no\nre\n\n p\no\nsi\n\ntio\nn\n o\n\nf \nso\n\nu\nrc\n\ne\n (\n\nkm\n)\n\n2\n0\n1\n1\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n3\n0\n0\n\n4\n0\n0\n\n5\n0\n0\n\n6\n0\n0\n\n7\n0\n0\n\n8\n0\n0\n\n9\n0\n0\n\n!\n2\n0\n0\n\n!\n1\n0\n00\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n\nA\nlo\n\nn\ng\n s\n\nh\no\nre\n\n p\no\nsi\n\ntio\nn\n o\n\nf \nso\n\nu\nrc\n\ne\n (\n\nkm\n)\n\nM\ne\na\nn\n\n \n\n \nn\no\n D\n\nV\nM\n\n D\nV\n\nM\n\nFigure 4.8: Dispersal distance of particles supplied to each area according to the alongshore\nlocation of all areas when functioning as sources.

On\nthe other hand, supply is carried out from farther north all along the WIM.\n\nTaking in consideration the dispersal distance averaged in time (Figure 4.10), its analy-\nsis is less evident because positive (negative) values may indicate either supply to the north\n(south) or supply from the south (north). But it is interesting to remark the interannual\nvariability. To years with marked poleward events early in the period of supply, such as\n2001, 2005, 2007 and 2010 (see Figure 4.2), correspond preferential northward dispersal\nduring February and sometimes mid-March. In average (last subplot) the balance is prac-\ntically zero, with southward tendency from April on for the case with no DVM and from\nMarch on in the case of DVM. Note that the time period is relative to the deployment\nof larvae, and not the analysis period (after 30 days, and for 10 days), which means that\nthe larvae supplied in April were recruited already during the upwelling season. The DVM\ncase shows more clearly southward dispersal prevailing over northward dispersal.\n\n4.3.5 Connectivity Matrix\n\nFigures 4.11 and 4.12 present the connectivity matrices for the case without and with\nDVM, respectively, for the all the areas along the WIM, including the ones located in the\nnorthern and southern coasts. Each line of the matrix represents the distribution of larvae\noriginating from each area (y-axis) that successfully recruit to the different areas along the\ncoast (x-axis). That is, following the diagonal, which means self-recruitment, the upper\ntriangular matrix indicates where areas are supplied from the north (equartorward disper-\nsal), and the lower triangular matrix where they are supplied from the south (poleward\ndispersal).\n\nWith respect to the case of no DVM, the most striking differences in relation to the\nconnectivity matrix of Nolasco et al. (2013b) are less accumulation, seen by the differences\nin the order of magnitude (colorbar), and less self-recruitment. To the north of Douro,\nsupply is carried out mostly from the south, most evident for Finisterre. Between Douro\nand Peniche, particles are supplied preferentially from the north, recruiting larvae from\nalmost as far as Arousa. Furthermore, we observe again a gap in the Tejo-Sado region:\nlarvae originated here do not travel north, and between Peniche and Tejo supply is carried\nout strictly from the north (mostly south of Aveiro). This was also observed by Nolasco et\nal. (2013b). Between Sado and Cape St Vincent, recruitment is done in both directions,\nalthough Cape St Vincent is strongly supplied by the region south of Mira.\n\nIn what concerns the case of DVM, the diagonal band is wider, indicating larger disper-\nsal, and general higher recruitment, seen by the lighter blues. Higher recruitment, whether\nsupply is done northward or southward, is enabled by the fact that larvae, is less advected\noffshore in case of northerly winds and less retained onshore in case of southerly winds,\nallowing the particles to travel longer distances. Also, there is higher dispersal to the\nsouth, seen by the displacement of the diagonal band toward the \u201cupper\u201d triangle; hence,\nthere is a tendency for recruitment to happen in the N-S direction. This is consistent\nwith the analysis of the dispersal/accumulation kernels (Figures 4.3 and 4.4), where the\nsame southward displacement was observed.

This\nLagrangian study is applied to the interannual ROMS run described in chapter 3.\n\nAn experiment including diel vertical migration are analyzed in parallel with the ones\nin the absence of DVM in order to assess the differences between both. Indeed, low ac-\ncumulation is a consequence of the absence of vertical migration. By not allowing the\nparticles to descend periodically in the water column, they remain in the surface Ekman\nlayer and are thus constantly transported offshore in the presence of upweeling and away\nfrom their origin, contributing to lower probability of recruitment.\n\n96\n\n\n\nFin\n\nAro\n\nMin\n\nDou\n\nAve\n\nMon\n\nPen\n\nTej\nSad\n\nMir\n\nCSV\n\n \nret\n\no\nu\n\nt\n\nF\nin\n\nA\nro\n\nM\nin\n\nD\no\n\nu\n\nA\nv\ne\n\nM\no\n\nn\n\nP\ne\n\nn\n\nT\ne\n\nj\nS\n\na\nd\n\nM\nir\n\nC\nS\n\nV\n\n \n\n \n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\nx 10\n\n!4\n\nFigure 4.12: Connectivity matrix with DVM.\n\nOne of the major factors influencing these processes and patterns is wind stress, and\nparticularly meridional wind stress, which, as seen throughout this work in the previous\nchapters, regulates the upper level circulation off WIM in the shelf region. During the\nmonths that were taken into account, which are mainly winter and spring, winds are\nvery variable, with some years witnessing strong poleward episodes, especially in February\n(2001, 2002, 2007, 2010), and a few equatorward and generally weaker episodes, occurring\nmost frequently in April (2001, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011), although equatorward winds\nexist every year.\n\nIn spite of the fact that particles should preferentially supply to and be supplied from\ncloser areas, the dispersal and accumulation kernels (Figures 4.3 and 4.4) show that this is\nnot necessarily the case and that it varies greatly from year to year. Equatorward winds\nprevail from April to June, although punctuated by poleward episodes. Long periods of\nequatorward winds and particularly strong poleward episodes occurring for at least a month\noriginate dispersal/accumulation at great distances. The years with fewer poleward events\nseem to be the ones where supply is carried out in both directions.\n\nThe supply from source and to sink images reveal that the ability to supply to or ac-\n\n97\n\n\n\ncumulate depend strongly on topography. The WIM northern extremity areas are poor\nsources but good sinks, likely due to the Galician Rias embayments and jagged coastline\nthat are prone for the retention of particles. Tejo and Sado, being located directly south of\nthe Estremadura Promontory, are observed to be poor sources, although with good abilities\nto retain, alongside Peniche, which is located between two capes. And the WIM southern\nextremity, the southwest-oriented Cape St Vincent, presents tendency to accumulation.\nThe best sources are located in the areas with the smoothest coastlines, promoting along-\nshore transport of the particles. The connectivity matrices also confirm the Estremadura\nPromontory as an obstacle for the supply from the south, in both simulations.\n\nThe absence of vertical migration promotes larger advection, as seen in Figures 4.8-\n4.10. On the other hand, self-recruitment does not greatly increase when introducing\nDVM. Hence, it must be due to the continuous distribution of sources and sinks along the\ncoast, instead of just taking into account the major estuaries as in the work of Nolasco\net al. (2013b). Furthermore, those authors report, for instances, Aveiro and Mondego as\ngood sinks, which is not the case in the present study; rather the reverse. The difference\nmust be attributed to the evenly distributed areas alongshore that makes it easier for the\nsupply to be done farther away rather than in its point of origin. In their work, there were\nno areas of recruitment between Aveiro and Mondego, hence larvae would either disperse\nor return to their own estuary; here, they can easily be recruited into adjacent areas that\nare only 12 km apart.\n\nThere is another striking difference between the cases with and without DVM: in the\nformer, supply increases significantly, especially in the southern locations, which is a di-\nrect consequence of the particles not being subject to offshore advection associated with\nEkman transport in the presence of equatorward winds. An increase in retention is also\nevident when observing the connectivity matrices with and without DVM, and although\nself-recruitment does not clearly increase, retention between adjacent areas is more notice-\nable.\n\n98\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nA Future Climate Scenario, part 1:\nGlobal Climate Models as forcing for\nregional ocean modeling\n\nPart of the contents of this chapter have been submitted to Climate Dynamics (Cordeiro\nPires et al., in review).\n\n5.1 Overview\n\nGlobal climate models (GCMs) have been one of the most important tools of the past\nthree decades for studying climate, whether past variability or future scenarios in the con-\ntext of global change. The increasing need for realistic assessments of climate change from a\npolicymaker and social-economical point of view calls for the minimization of uncertainties,\nnot only of the models themselves but also of the future scenarios the climate simulations\nare based on.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) has played a major role in\nproviding a large database of state-of-the-art GCM simulations from numerous research\ninstitutes around the world, open to the scientific community, comprising not only past\nsimulations but also simulations forced by scenarios of future climate (Nakic?enovic? et al.,\n2000). Consequently, several multi-model inter-comparison studies were carried out (e.g.\nCollins et al., 2006; Fyfe et al., 2010; Lorenzo et al., 2011) to assess the models ability to\nsimulate a given phenomenon or variable, and allow the conjugation of different models\nin a specific study. The Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP) was created\nwith this intent (Lambert and Boer, 2001), making it possible to evaluate the strengths\nand weaknesses of the GCMs. A way to minimize the individual model biases is to use\nthe multi-model ensemble mean, that is, the combination of output from different models\n(Tebaldi and Knutti, 2007). This approach has been increasingly considered the most\nsuitable in climate projections because, assuming that simulation errors in different GCMs\nare independent, the mean of all the models can be expected to present lower uncertainties\n\n99\n\n\n\nthan each model individually (Lambert and Boer, 2001). Compared against historical\nobserved gridded data, the ensemble mean shows good results in replicating historical\nclimate, from which we can infer that it is also a valid approach in the representation of\nfuture climate conditions (Ra?isa?nen and Palmer, 2001). Pierce et al. (2009) and Annan\nand Hargreaves (2010) carried out statistical analyses of the CMIP3 model set and showed\nthat, in general, the best results are obtained with the multi-model ensemble of a selection\nof models.\n\nThe atmospheric regimes simulated by GCMs have been thoroughly explored. With\nrespect to ocean studies based on atmosphere-ocean coupled GCMs (CGCMs), there are\nseveral underlying difficulties: (a) there are by far fewer observation data than for the\natmosphere, rendering model validation more difficult; (b) the air-sea interactions and\nfeedbacks are strongly non-linear and therefore more difficult to predict and simulate; (c)\nCGCMs, especially in deeper layers, usually fail to properly represent the ocean mean state\ndue to their coarse resolution (Russell et al., 2005); (d) assessments of future global ocean\nregimes, which must take into account the ocean distinct time of response and the role of\nmesoscale phenomena, have limited reliability. Ocean modeling studies where one or several\nCGCMs of the CMIP database have been used include that of Stouffer et al. (2006) to\nstudy the thermohaline circulation variability and that of Karnauskas et al. (2009) where\nsea surface temperature tendencies were focused on. However, to date, there have been no\nstudies with the purpose of assessing if these global climate models were able to properly\nrepresent the mean hydrography of the ocean, whether global or regional, and which ones\nwere more accurate.\n\nDue to their seasonality nature, upwelling systems are very sensitive to climate change\n(Holt et al., 2010). It is of high interest to try to assess the impacts of climate change on the\nhydrography and circulation of these areas, because such changes may have consequences\non the respective ecosystem (Pauly and Christensen, 1995). In order to do so, one needs\nan ocean model with a good horizontal and vertical resolution, and reliable atmospheric\nconditions to use as forcing. In what concerns the latter, with the IPCC future scenarios\nand the several CGCM simulations at our disposal, if we are able to obtain good results\nregarding the present climate, we can postulate that the same configuration and forcing\nmust be reasonable for applying climate scenarios. One of the most recent works under\nthis scope and for this region is that of Miranda et al. (2012), who used a regional climate\nmodel to force a ROMS configuration, and assessed the impacts on the hydrography of\nthe coastal waters and offshore the Iberian Peninsula. Our approach is different in the\nsense that, before applying a future climate scenario to the ocean model (chapter 6), we\nfirst evaluate the performance of several CGCMs for the present climate and assess their\ndifferences, rather than choosing only one CGCM as forcing for the ocean model. In this\nway, we are aiming at finding the most adequate regional atmospheric forcing, both present\nand future simulations.\n\nHence, the present work consists in a sensitivity study aiming at the evaluation CGCMs\nas forcing in regional ocean simulations, with focus on FD (although sometimes extending\nto the Eastern North Atlantic Basin or the North Atlantic), for the present climate. To\nachieve this, the study is divided into two distinct parts. In the first part (section 5.3), the\n\n100\n\n\n\noutput of nine CGCMs is analyzed regarding the variables needed to force ROMS. This is\ncarried out in two ways: an analysis of difference fields between every CGCM and COADS,\nfor every variable; and through the computation of the RMSE between each CGCM and\nCOADS, for every variable (section 5.3.9). In the second part (section 5.4), two of the\nCGCMs with the highest RMSE relative to COADS are set as surface forcing for two\nROMS runs, with the purpose of assessing the range of uncertainty comprised in this set\nof CGCMs. In addition, two other ROMS simulations are carried out: one forced with\nCOADS, which serves as the control run; the other forced with the average of the nine\nCGCMs \u2014 the ensemble mean. The ultimate goal of the sensitivity study is to find the\nmost suitable forcing for this region and, hence, the one that should be used to evaluate\nocean climate change based on future climate scenarios.\n\n5.2 Data and Methodology\n\n5.2.1 Forcing variables\n\nThe variables needed to force ROMS, which comprise the COADS climatology and\nwhich will be compared for each CGCM, are the following: sea level pressure (SLP, in\nPa); surface air temperature (SAT, in oC), radiation fluxes (longwave, shortwave and net\nheat balance, the latter including latent and sensible heat transfer \u2014 SW, LW and NH,\nrespectively, in W m?2), water flux into ocean (evaporation minus precipitation \u2014 E-P,\nin mm d?1 \u2014 including the discharge of the world main rivers), sea surface temperature\n(SST, in oC), sea surface salinity (SSS), wind stress (zonal and meridional components \u2014\nTx and Ty, in N m?2); and specific humidity (SH, in g kg?1), which will only be analyzed\nin the RMSE study. These variables are inter-compared through difference fields between\neach CGCM and COADS, and through the RMSE computed for FD, also between each\nCGCM and COADS.\n\n5.2.2 Climatologies\n\nThe climatology used for both the CGCM inter-comparison and the ROMS control run\nis the Comprehensive Ocean and Atmosphere Data Set (COADS). COADS has been, by\nexcellence, the used climatology for such regional ocean modeling studies (e.g. Marchesiello\net al., 2001) and this data set is described in section 2.2.1.\n\nThe CGCM sea level pressure is compared with the National Center for Environmental\nPrediction (NCEP/NCAR) Reanalysis. The NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis project uses a state-\nof-the-art analysis/forecast system to perform data assimilation using past data from 1948\nto the present (Kalnay et al., 1996).\n\n101\n\n\n\n5.2.3 CGCMs\n\nThe IPCC model data for this study were retrieved from the World Climate Research\nProgramme (WCRP \u2014 http://www.wcrp-climate.org/) through the Coupled Model Inter-\ncomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) archived at the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis\nand Inter-comparison (PCMDI) (http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/about ipcc.php). This\nprogram has made available a multi-model dataset of outputs from over 20 GCMs, for every\nIPCC future climate change scenario, as well as the past and present climate, plus several\nruns for each model that started from different initial conditions (Meehl et al., 2007).\n\nFrom the large PCMDI database, we selected nine models, chosen because they included\nnot only an atmospheric model but also an ocean module to provide ocean forcing variables\n(coupled models \u2014 CGCMs). CGCMs also have ocean temperature and salinity vertical\nprofiles, but preliminary analyses have shown that values were very far from the World\nOcean Atlas 2009 (Antonov et al., 2010; Locarnini et al., 2010) and, therefore, not suited as\nvertical initial and boundary conditions. Instead, the WOA09 is used in the CGCM-forced\nruns, as it is in the control run. The models are listed in Table 5.1, where their name,\norigin and spatial resolution are presented. The CGCM output is monthly averaged for\neach variable (described in section 5.2.1), and for the same period of COADS (1945-1989)\n(see section 2.2.1). The approach is to run climatological simulations; hence, the daily\nvalues of all variables for period 1945-1989 are averaged into a data set of monthly means.\nTherefore, each ROMS run year is forced with the same monthly values.\n\nFor the computation of the ensemble mean, which consists in the average of all the\nCGCMs considered in this study, each CGCM climatology is gridded to 2.5o \u00d72.5o (1.25o \u00d7\n1.25o for the ocean) by means of bicubic interpolation, after the application of a land mask.\nFinally, a plain averaging of the nine CGCMs is computed for every variable.\n\n5.2.4 ROMS Configuration\n\nROMS setup is similar to that of chapter 2, that is, a climatological run, and the domain\nis FD. All runs have WOA09 as initial and boundary conditions, and each of the four runs\nhas the respective surface forcing, as described in the previous section. SST and SSS\nundergo the same heat correction as in the climatological run to take into account thermal\nfeedback at the ocean surface and to avoid numerical drift, using the CGCM monthly\nmeans. Each run final 5 years of output is averaged and we thus obtain climatological\nvalues.\n\n5.2.5 Error Computation\n\nAs previously carried out in chapter 3, in the evaluation of the CGCMs the root mean\nsquare error (RMSE) (Wilks, 2006) is computed in order to quantify how close the CGCM\n\n102\n\n\n\nIn\nst\nit\nu\nti\no\nn\n\nM\no\nd\nel\n\nd\nes\nig\nn\na\nti\no\nn\n\nC\no\nu\nn\ntr\ny\n\nL\na\nn\nd\n\nO\nce\na\nn\n\nR\nef\ner\nen\n\nce\nR\nes\no\nlu\nti\no\nn\n\nR\nes\no\nlu\nti\no\nn\n\nC\na\nn\na\nd\nia\nn\nC\nen\ntr\ne\nfo\nr\nC\nli\nm\na\nte\n\nC\nG\nC\nM\n\nv\ner\nsi\no\nn\n3\n(t\n4\n7\n)\n\nC\na\nn\na\nd\na\n\n3\n.7\n5\no\n\u00d7\n\n3\n.7\n1\no\n\n1\n.8\n8\no\n\u00d7\n\n1\n.8\n6\no\n\nF\nla\nto\n\net\nM\no\nd\nel\nli\nn\ng\na\nn\nd\nA\nn\na\nly\nsi\ns\n(C\n\nC\nC\nM\nA\n)\n\na\nl.\n(2\n0\n0\n0\n)\n\nC\nen\ntr\ne\nN\na\nti\no\nn\na\nl\nd\ne\nR\nec\nh\ner\nch\nes\n\nC\nM\n\nv\ner\nsi\no\nn\n3\n\nF\nra\nn\nce\n\n2\n.8\n1\no\n\u00d7\n\n2\n.7\n9\no\n\n2\no\n\u00d7\n\n1\no\n\nS\na\nla\ns-\nM\ne?l\nia\n\nM\ne?t\ne?o\nro\nlo\ng\niq\nu\nes\n\n(C\nN\nR\nM\n)\n\net\na\nl.\n\n(2\n0\n0\n5\n)\n\nC\nen\nte\nr\nfo\nr\nC\nli\nm\na\nte\n\nS\ny\nst\nem\n\nM\no\nd\nel\n\nfo\nr\n\nJ\na\np\na\nn\n\n2\n.8\n1\no\n\u00d7\n\n2\n.7\n9\no\n\n1\n.4\n1\no\n\u00d7\n1\no\n\nR\nes\nea\nrc\nh\n,\nU\nn\niv\ner\nsi\nty\n\no\nf\nT\no\nk\ny\no\n\nIn\nte\nrd\nis\nci\np\nli\nn\na\nry\n\n(C\nC\nS\nR\n),\nth\ne\nN\na\nti\no\nn\na\nl\nIn\nst\nit\nu\nte\n\nfo\nr\n\nR\nes\nea\nrc\nh\nO\nn\nC\nli\nm\na\nte\n\nH\na\nsu\nm\ni\na\nn\nd\n\nE\nn\nv\nir\no\nn\nm\nen\nta\nl\nS\ntu\nd\nie\ns\n(N\n\nIE\nS\n)\na\nn\nd\n\n\u2014\nm\ned\niu\nm\n\nre\nso\nlu\nti\no\nn\n\nE\nm\no\nri\n\n(2\n0\n0\n4\n)\n\nth\ne\nF\nro\nn\nti\ner\n\nR\nes\nea\nrc\nh\nC\nen\nte\nr\n\n(M\nIR\n\nO\nC\n\nm\ned\n\nre\ns)\n\nfo\nr\nG\nlo\nb\na\nl\nC\nh\na\nn\ng\ne\n(F\n\nR\nC\nG\nC\n)\n\nC\no\nm\nm\no\nn\nw\nea\nlt\nh\nS\nci\nen\nti\nfi\nc\na\nn\nd\n\nM\na\nrk\n\n3\n.5\n\n(M\nk\n3\n.5\n)\n\nA\nu\nst\nra\nli\na\n\n1\n.8\n8\no\n\u00d7\n\n1\n.8\n7\no\n\n1\n.8\n8\no\n\u00d7\n\n0\n.9\n3\no\n\nG\no\nrd\no\nn\net\n\nIn\nd\nu\nst\nri\na\nl\nR\nes\nea\nrc\nh\nO\nrg\na\nn\nis\na\nti\no\nn\n\na\nl.\n(2\n0\n0\n2\n)\n\n(C\nS\nIR\n\nO\n)\n\nG\neo\np\nh\ny\nsi\nca\nl\nF\nlu\nid\ns\nD\ny\nn\na\nm\nic\ns\n\nC\nM\n\nv\ner\nsi\no\nn\n2\n.0\n\nU\nS\nA\n\n2\n.5\n\no\n\u00d7\n2\no\n\n1\no\n\u00d7\n\n1\no\n\nD\nel\nw\no\nrt\nh\n\nL\na\nb\no\nra\nto\nry\n\n(G\nF\nD\nL\n-N\n\nO\nA\nA\n)\n\net\na\nl.\n\n(2\n0\n0\n6\n)\n\nG\no\nd\nd\na\nrd\n\nIn\nst\nit\nu\nte\n\nfo\nr\nS\np\na\nce\n\nE\n-R\n\nm\no\nd\nel\n\nU\nS\nA\n\n5\no\n\u00d7\n4\no\n\n5\no\n\u00d7\n\n4\no\n\nR\nu\nss\nel\nl\net\n\nS\ntu\nd\nie\ns\n(G\n\nIS\nS\n-N\n\nA\nS\nA\n)\n\na\nl.\n(1\n9\n9\n5\n)\n\nM\net\neo\nro\nlo\ng\nic\na\nl\nR\nes\nea\nrc\nh\nIn\nst\nit\nu\nte\n\nC\nG\nC\nM\n\nv\ner\nsi\no\nn\n2\n.3\n.2\n\nJ\na\np\na\nn\n\n3\n.7\n5\no\n\u00d7\n\n2\n.5\n\no\n1\n.2\n5\no\n\u00d7\n\n1\n.2\n5\no\n\nY\nu\nk\nim\n\no\nto\n\n(M\nR\nI)\n\net\na\nl.\n\n(2\n0\n0\n1\n)\n\nM\net\n\nO\nffi\nce\n\n(U\nK\nM\nO\n)\n\nH\na\nd\nle\ny\nC\nen\nte\nr\nfo\nr\n\nU\nK\n\n1\n.8\n8\no\n\u00d7\n\n1\n.8\n7\no\n\n1\no\n\u00d7\n\n1\no\n\nC\nli\nm\na\nte\n\nP\nre\nd\nic\nti\no\nn\na\nn\nd\n\nP\no\np\ne\net\n\nR\nes\nea\nrc\nh\ncl\nim\n\na\nte\n\nm\no\nd\nel\n\na\nl.\n(2\n0\n0\n0\n)\n\nv\ner\nsi\no\nn\n3\n(H\n\na\nd\nC\nM\n3\n)\n\nM\na\nx\nP\nla\nn\nck\n\nIn\nst\nit\nu\nte\n\n(M\nP\nI)\n\nE\nu\nro\np\nea\nn\nC\nen\ntr\ne\n/\n\nG\ner\nm\na\nn\ny\n\n2\n.8\n1\no\n\u00d7\n\n2\n.7\n9\no\n\n2\n.5\n\no\n\u00d7\n2\no\n\nR\no\nec\nk\nn\ner\n\nH\na\nm\nb\nu\nrg\n\nM\no\nd\nel\n\net\na\nl.\n\n(2\n0\n0\n3\n)\n\nv\ner\nsi\no\nn\n5\n(E\n\nC\nH\nA\nM\n5\n)\n\nT\na\nb\nle\n\n5\n.1\n:\nC\nG\nC\nM\n\nd\nes\nig\nn\na\nti\no\nn\n,\nin\nst\nit\nu\nti\no\nn\n,\nco\nu\nn\ntr\ny\no\nf\no\nri\ng\nin\n,\nh\no\nri\nzo\nn\nta\nl\nre\nso\nlu\nti\no\nn\na\nn\nd\nli\nte\nra\ntu\nre\n\nre\nfe\nre\nn\nce\n.\n\n103\n\n\n\noutput is to COADS (the considered reference) as forcing:\n\nRMSE =\n\n?\n1\n\nN\n\n?\n\ni\n\n(Mi ?

Most fields concern the entire North Atlantic (Figure 1.1 a),\nto enable the analysis of the complete patterns, others concern an enlarged area around\nFD, that is called in this work Eastern North Atlantic Basin (ENAB) (Figure 1.1 b) for\nsimplification. This domain is used when a more detailed analysis of the mean field is\njustified. Second, the seasonal cycle of each variable, averaged over FD (Figure 1.1 c), as\nwell as the respective RMSE, are analyzed.\n\n5.3.1 Climatological Mean Fields\n\nFigures 5.1 and 5.2 show the climatological mean fields of each variable for winter and\nsummer, respectively (NCEP for the case of SLP, COADS for all the others). The typ-\nical winter and summer patterns are evident in these fields: in SLP (Figures 5.1,5.2 a),\nthe typical winter dipole between the Iceland Low and the Azores High, as well as the\nnorthward migration of the former in summer; the northward summer warming in SAT\n(Figures 5.1,5.2 b); prevailing precipitation in winter and evaporation in summer (Fig-\nures 5.1,5.2 e); the Earth\u2019s heat loss in winter and heat gain in summer (Figures 5.1,5.2 g-\ni); and the less seasonal varying in the ocean (Figures 5.1,5.2 c,d). Finally, close to the\ncoast, the winds show prevailing northerly flow in summer, consistent with the presence of\nthe Azores High, while in winter winds are in general weak and often with no meridional\ncomponent, contrary to what could be expected from the SLP winter conditions, prone\nfor the passage of low-pressure systems that are characterized by southerly/southwesterly\nwinds. This is an important aspect of COADS, that is discussed throughout this work.\n\n5.3.2 Sea Level Pressure (SLP)\n\nThe pressure fields are the main driving mechanisms of the entire climate system. Fig-\nure 5.3 shows the differences between each model and the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis for\nwinter. Figure 5.4 presents the same but for summer. In winter, all models overestimate\nSLP over Greenland and the majority does so also at midlatitudes (30-40oN), with CC-\nCMA, CNRM and CSIRO (Figure 5.3 a,b,d) presenting this positive difference up to the\n\n104\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Winter COADS mean fields for forcing ROMS: (a) SLP (Pa); (b) SAT (oC);\n(c) SST (oC); d) SSS; e) E-P (mm d?1); f) Wind Stress (N m?2) (arrow scale indicates\n0.1 N m?2); (g) SW Flux (W m?2); (h) LW Flux (W m?2); (i) Net Heat Flux (W m?2).\n\n105\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Same as Figure 5.1 but for summer.\n\n106\n\n\n\n  4\n0o\n\nW\n \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n  1\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  3\n0o\n\nN\n \n\n  4\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  6\n0o\n\nN\n \n\na)\n C\n\nC\nC\n\nM\nA\n\n  4\n0o\n\nW\n \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n  1\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  3\n0o\n\nN\n \n\n  4\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  6\n0o\n\nN\n \n\nb)\n C\n\nN\nR\n\nM\n\n  4\n0o\n\nW\n \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n  1\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  3\n0o\n\nN\n \n\n  4\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  6\n0o\n\nN\n \n\nc)\n M\n\nIR\nO\n\nC\n\n  4\n0o\n\nW\n \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n  1\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  3\n0o\n\nN\n \n\n  4\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  6\n0o\n\nN\n \n\nd)\n C\n\nS\nIR\n\nO\n\n  4\n0o\n\nW\n \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n  1\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  3\n0o\n\nN\n \n\n  4\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  6\n0o\n\nN\n \n\ne)\n G\n\nFD\nL\n\n  4\n0o\n\nW\n \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n  1\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  3\n0o\n\nN\n \n\n  4\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  6\n0o\n\nN\n \n\nf) \nG\n\nIS\nS\n\n  4\n0o\n\nW\n \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n  1\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  3\n0o\n\nN\n \n\n  4\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  6\n0o\n\nN\n \n\ng)\n M\n\nR\nI\n\n  4\n0o\n\nW\n \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n  1\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  3\n0o\n\nN\n \n\n  4\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  6\n0o\n\nN\n \n\nh)\n U\n\nK\nM\n\nO\n\n  4\n0o\n\nW\n \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n  1\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  3\n0o\n\nN\n \n\n  4\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  6\n0o\n\nN\n \n\ni) \nM\n\nP\nI\n\n  4\n0o\n\nW\n \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n  1\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  3\n0o\n\nN\n \n\n  4\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  6\n0o\n\nN\n  \n\n \nj) \n\nen\nse\n\nm\nbl\n\ne\n\n!5\n00\n\n!4\n00\n\n!3\n00\n\n!2\n00\n\n!1\n00\n\n010\n0\n\n20\n0\n\n30\n0\n\n40\n0\n\n50\n0\n\nFigure 5.3: Differences of SLP (Pa) between each CGCM, including the ensemble mean,\nand the NCEP reanalysis for winter in the North Atlantic.\n\n107\n\n\n\n  4\n0o\n\nW\n \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n  1\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  3\n0o\n\nN\n \n\n  4\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  6\n0o\n\nN\n \n\na)\n C\n\nC\nC\n\nM\nA\n\n  4\n0o\n\nW\n \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n  1\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  3\n0o\n\nN\n \n\n  4\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  6\n0o\n\nN\n \n\nb)\n C\n\nN\nR\n\nM\n\n  4\n0o\n\nW\n \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n  1\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  3\n0o\n\nN\n \n\n  4\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  6\n0o\n\nN\n \n\nc)\n M\n\nIR\nO\n\nC\n\n  4\n0o\n\nW\n \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n  1\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  3\n0o\n\nN\n \n\n  4\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  6\n0o\n\nN\n \n\nd)\n C\n\nS\nIR\n\nO\n\n  4\n0o\n\nW\n \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n  1\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  3\n0o\n\nN\n \n\n  4\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  6\n0o\n\nN\n \n\ne)\n G\n\nFD\nL\n\n  4\n0o\n\nW\n \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n  1\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  3\n0o\n\nN\n \n\n  4\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  6\n0o\n\nN\n \n\nf) \nG\n\nIS\nS\n\n  4\n0o\n\nW\n \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n  1\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  3\n0o\n\nN\n \n\n  4\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  6\n0o\n\nN\n \n\ng)\n M\n\nR\nI\n\n  4\n0o\n\nW\n \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n  1\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  3\n0o\n\nN\n \n\n  4\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  6\n0o\n\nN\n \n\nh)\n U\n\nK\nM\n\nO\n\n  4\n0o\n\nW\n \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n  1\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  3\n0o\n\nN\n \n\n  4\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  6\n0o\n\nN\n \n\ni) \nM\n\nP\nI\n\n  4\n0o\n\nW\n \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n  1\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  3\n0o\n\nN\n \n\n  4\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  6\n0o\n\nN\n  \n\n \nj) \n\nen\nse\n\nm\nbl\n\ne\n\n!5\n00\n\n!4\n00\n\n!3\n00\n\n!2\n00\n\n!1\n00\n\n010\n0\n\n20\n0\n\n30\n0\n\n40\n0\n\n50\n0\n\nFigure 5.4: Same as Figure 5.3 but for summer.\n\n108\n\n\n\nequator. The exceptions are GISS, MRI and UKMO (Figure 5.3 f-h), which present neg-\native differences for this region, the typical location of the Azores High. There is also a\ngeneral underestimation of pressure over Great Britain. Even for a variable that presents\na more or less steady seasonal behavior such as SLP, the results vary greatly from model\nto model. In the end, the ensemble (Figure 5.3 j) presents the lowest differences when\ncomparing to observations, with a tendency to intensify the high-pressure centers and at-\ntenuate the low-pressure centers in relation to the observed values. In summer (Figure 5.4),\nthe positive differences are displaced northward, as is the Azores High center; therefore the\nmodels overestimation remains related to the same phenomenon. This general positive\ndifference is the main feature of the multi-model ensemble mean (Figure 5.4 j). In the\narea delimited by the coasts of Europe, Africa and South America, the general signal is\nnegative, especially in GISS and UKMO (Figure 5.4 f,h), with the exception of CCCMA,\nCNRM and CSIRO (Figure 5.4 a,b,d), which roughly overestimate SLP throughout the\nNorth Atlantic. These models were already the exception in winter.\n\n5.3.3 Surface Air Temperature (SAT)\n\nSAT is also a variable of consequence to the ocean surface in terms of air-sea interac-\ntion. In addition, it is the parameter on which climate change is most strikingly reflected.\nFigure 5.5 shows the differences between each model and COADS for winter, Figure 5.6\nthe same for summer. It is interesting to notice that the majority of models overestimates\nSAT over the Gulf Stream and most of these all along the North Atlantic Current path.\nThis is accompanied by an underestimation of SAT around Greenland. Moreover, SAT\nwithin the subtropical gyre tends to be lower than COADS (Figure 5.5 c,e,i). These are\nthe main features that are reflected in the ensemble (Figure 5.5 j). CSIRO and UKMO\n(Figure 5.5 d,h) show warmer SATs along the western coasts of Europe and Africa, while\nGISS and MPI (Figure 5.5 f,i) overestimate SAT near the equator. In summer (Figure 5.6),\nthe overestimation over the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Current is less evident; on\nthe contrary, there are some models that present lower SATs than the observations. There\nis higher discrepancy between models in this season. The main differences, reflected on the\ncorresponding ensemble, are, again, an underestimation in the region of the subtropical\ngyre and an overestimation near the equator off the African coast. As far as the Iberian\nPeninsula coast is concerned, SAT is less than 1oC lower in winter and less than 1oC higher\nin summer, which may be due to the influence of the SAT overland.\n\n5.3.4 Sea Surface Temperature (SST)\n\nThe differences of SST between climatology and models (Figures 5.7 and 5.8) present\nsome similarities to those of surface air temperature, namely the tendency of the models\nto underestimate SST in the region of the subtropical gyre. However, the models are\nless coincidental. In general, in winter (Figure 5.7) there is overestimation of SST in\nthe Gulf Stream and underestimation in the region of the subtropical gyre. SST around\nGreenland is underestimated by the majority of models, and some of them extend this\n\n109\n\n\n\n  4\n0o\n\nW\n \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n   \n0o\n\n  \n\n  1\n5o\n\nN\n \n\n  3\n0o\n\nN\n

The differences change signal around the equator. The\nensemble (Figure 5.7 j) shows a general negative difference of 1-3oC, with the exception of\nthe area of the Gulf Stream. In summer (Figure 5.8), this pattern is even more generalized\nand fewer models present the overestimation over the Gulf Stream. Observing the eastern\nbasin, the ensemble results are better for winter than for summer: the differences in relation\nto COADS are of less than 1oC in winter and 1 to 2oC in summer.\n\n5.3.5 Sea Surface Salinity (SSS)\n\nSalinity is the variable that models find the hardest to reproduce. It is a parame-\nter harder to calibrate, since there are no satellite products on which to validate. It is\nrapidly influenced by the precipitation-evaporation balance and river discharge and it de-\npends strongly on density. Due to the SSS weak seasonality (salinity distribution does not\nvary substantially throughout the year), we present results for winter only (Figure 5.9).\nThe discrepancy between models is very high, although the differences of between mod-\nels and COADS are somewhat similar to those of SST (Figures 5.7 and 5.8): overesti-\nmation of SSS in the Gulf Stream, underestimations along the North Atlantic Current\n(Figure 5.9 a,c,h,i), in the region of the subtropical gyre (Figure 5.9 a,f,g) and around\nGreenland (Figure 5.9 a,d,e). There is also an overall lower SSS near the equator as repro-\nduced by the models, reflected on the ensemble (Figure 5.9 j). Once again, the ensemble\nsucceeds in minimizing the differences of individual models in relation to observed data, as\nit presents the lowest differences when comparing to COADS. Off the Iberian Peninsula,\ndifferences are less than 0.5.\n\n5.3.6 Evaporation Minus Precipitation (E-P)\n\nBefore entering further into this variable, it is necessary to properly define it. Evapo-\nration minus precipitation is a water flux input measurement. When positive, evaporation\nis higher than precipitation (negative water flux into ocean), and vice-versa for negative\nvalues. In what COADS is concerned, it consists only of an atmospheric water flux, but for\nthe CGCMs, the river input is also taken into account. Furthermore, the differences be-\ntween models and climatology do not have a straightforward meaning. Positive differences,\nfor instances, can mean the model shows stronger evaporation than COADS or that the\nfluxes at that point are reversed. Therefore, we choose to present results for the eastern\nbasin only (Figures 5.10 and 5.11). There is no river making the difference in water flux;\nhere the differences reflect essentially the ability of the models to well reproduce the pre-\ncipitation/evaporation cycle. Models vary greatly between them. The highest differences\nare in winter (Figure 5.10), in the northwestern corner, typically the location of the North\nAtlantic Current, and also in the Bay of Biscay and off Great Britain, a region of strong\nand constant rains. In summer (Figure 5.11), there is a general low negative difference\nthroughout the domain and the ensemble once again is able to minimize individual model\ndifferences.\n\n114\n\n\n\n  4\n0o\n\nW\n

5.13 show the vectorial differences of wind stress between each model\nand COADS for winter and summer, respectively, once more for the eastern basin rather\nthan the North Atlantic. Several models present strong differences near the coast (Fig-\nure 5.12 a,e,f; Figure 5.13 a,b,h) that can be accounted for by the vicinity of land and\nthe land-sea shear due to thermal wind. In general, in winter (Figure 5.12), models show\nstronger northeastward winds north and west of the Iberian Peninsula than COADS. This\ndifference is due to the fact that the COADS winds in winter, rather than being essen-\ntially southerly as expected from typical low-pressure systems in this season, are southward\nor with no meridional component. As for summer (Figure 5.13), the overall wind stress\npattern is very similar to COADS, especially in the ensemble mean (Figure 5.13 j). In\ngeneral, all models slightly overestimate southward wind stress along both coasts of the\nIberian Peninsula and North Africa. Some models (Figure 5.13 a,c,e,i) intensify the Azores\nHigh circulation, seen in the northeastward difference to the north and the southwestward\ndifference to the south.\n\n5.3.8 Radiation Fluxes\n\nRadiation fluxes are an important surface forcing and a relevant aspect to look at.\nFigure 5.14 shows the radiation fluxes difference fields between COADS and the multi-\nmodel ensemble mean for winter (upper row) and summer (lower row) in the ENAB.\nRadiation fluxes differ greatly from model to model and season to season. We chose to show\nfor the basin and for the ensemble only because for these parameters the large-scale patterns\nare not so important as the local input. The left column concerns the incoming shortwave\nradiation flux (SW), the middle column the outgoing longwave radiation flux (LW) and the\nright column the net heat balance (NH). This balance is computed taking into account not\nonly the SW and LW fluxes but also the latent and sensible heat fluxes, and the result is the\ndownward minus upward balance. SW and LW fluxes (Figure 5.14 a,b,d,e) are fairly well\nrepresented by the ensemble mean in relation to COADS, with the exception of summer\nSW flux (Figure 5.14 d), underestimated by the ensemble in the entire domain. In respect\nto NH (Figure 5.14 c,f), the concordance between datasets is less agreeable. In winter, the\nensemble overestimates NH up to 60 W m?2 while in summer it presents lower values than\nCOADS south of 36oN and off the Iberian Peninsula by about 30-40 W m?2. The much\ncoarser model resolution and consequently the aggravated difficulty in reproducing latent\nand sensible heat may be a reason for this discrepancy.\n\n5.3.9 CGCM Forcing Seasonal Cycles\n\nThe seasonal cycles of all variables, averaged over FD (Figure 1.1 c), are presented in\nFigure 5.15, superimposed to the COADS (control) cycle and the ensemble mean cycle. For\neach variable, the CGCM set covers a range of values; in some cases this range is wider (e.g.\nLW, SSS) than others (e.g. SW, NH).

For instances: CNRM overestimates SLP and underestimates LW,\nbut compares well in Ty and E-P; GFDL underestimates SAT and SST, but agrees well\nin SW and NH; GISS underestimates Tx and overestimates E-P, but is adequate in SSS.\nOverall, we cannot state from a first observation which model is the closest to COADS.\n\nFigure 5.16 presents the RMSE of each CGCM relative to COADS, for every variable.\nRMSE varies strongly seasonally, and we confirm the observations of Figure 5.15, that\nis, the good or bad performance of a CGCM depends on the variable. It is not possible\nto draw a best and a worst model in comparison to COADS. Yet, the ensemble mean\npresents consistently low errors for all variables, although it is rarely the one with the\nlowest RMSE. A few CGCMs stand out as having high RMSEs for several variables. For\ninstances: CSIRO and GFDL for SAT and E-P; CNRM for SLP and LW; CCCMA and\nMRI for Tx and Ty.\n\nThis inter-comparison does not allow us to clearly identify one CGCM as the best for\nall variables and disregard all the others.

Bearing this in mind, and given the differences among CGCMs from variable\nto variable, we focus on one of the ocean variables: SSS (Figures 5.15, 5.16 j), which is\ndifficult to reproduce in coarse resolution models. The two models that stand out in terms\nof overestimation and underestimation are CSIRO and CCCMA, respectively. Differences\nbetween CSIRO and COADS are about +0.5 to +0.8 (Figure 5.15 j), with a RMSE of\napproximately 0.28 (Figure 5.16 j), and CSIRO differences from the ensemble mean are\nroughly +0.7 throughout the year. CCCMA, on the other hand, differs from COADS by\n-0.5 to -0.8 and from the ensemble mean by approximately -0.5, while RMSE ranges from\n0.19 to 0.25. The choice of CCCMA instead of, for instances, MPI, which also presents\na high RMSE regarding SSS, is based on the relatively high RMSE that CCCMA also\npresents for LW, Tx and Ty; moreover, for SW and NH it also differs substantially from\nthe ensemble mean.\n\nThus, the following section is an analysis of four ROMS runs with similar configurations\n\n2 4 6 8 10 12\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\na) SLP (Pa)\n\n2 4 6 8 10 12\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\nb) SAT (\n\no\nC)\n\n2 4 6 8 10 12\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\nc) SH (g/kg)\n\n2 4 6 8 10 12\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\nd) SW (W/m\n\n2\n)\n\n2 4 6 8 10 12\n0\n\n5\n\n10\ne) LW (W/m\n\n2\n)\n\n2 4 6 8 10 12\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\nf) NH (W/m\n\n2\n)\n\n2 4 6 8 10 12\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\ng) Tx (N/m\n\n2\n)\n\n2 4 6 8 10 12\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\nh) Ty (N/m\n\n2\n)\n\n2 4 6 8 10 12\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\ni) SST (\n\no\nC)\n\nmonths\n2 4 6 8 10 12\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\nj) SSS\n\nmonths\n\n2 4 6 8 10 12\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\nk) E!P (mm/d)\n\nmonths\n\n \n\n \n\nCCCMA\n\nCSIRO\n\n CNRM\n\nMIROC\n\n GFDL\n\n GISS\n\n UKMO\n\n MPI\n\n MRI\n\nENSEM\n\nFigure 5.16: Monthly RMSE of (a) SLP (Pa); (b) SAT (oC); (c) SH (g kg?1); (d) SW\n(W m?2); (e) LW (W m?2); (f) NH (W m?2); (g) Tx (N m?2); (h) Ty (N m?2); (i)\nSST (oC); (j) SSS; (k) E-P (mm d?1) (see text for the acronyms) between each considered\nCGCM and the control run forcing (COADS), including their mean (ENSEM), averaged\nover the entire domain.\n\n123\n\n\n\nand applied to the same domain, but each forced at the surface with a different dataset:\n(a) COADS, which will be the control run; (b) CCCMA; (c) CSIRO; and (d) the ensemble\nmean, henceforth ENSEM.\n\n5.4 ROMS Runs\n\nROMS output of the four simulations is analyzed by means of surface fields and vertical\nslices of the ocean upper levels at key regions in the domain, focusing on the hydrography\nand circulation. Some seasonal characterization is also carried out through Hovmo?ller\ndiagrams. For a better assessment, some of the results are presented as differences between\neach CGCM-forced run and the COADS-forced (control) run. Results will be shown as\nmonthly means of the last 5 years of simulation. For simplification, ROMS runs will be\nidentified as follow: the COADS-forced run will be referred to as R COADS, and similarly\nR CCCMA, R CSIRO, R ENSEM.\n\nThe analysis will be focused on FD. Less attention will be paid to the regions near the\nboundaries, namely the Bay of Biscay and the Morocco northwestern coast.\n\n  30\no\nW   20\n\no\nW   10\n\no\nW \n\n  32\no\nN \n\n  36\no\nN \n\n  40\no\nN \n\n  44\no\nN \n\n  48\no\nN \n\nFigure 5.17: Map of the region under study (FD).

Regarding SSS, differences are always negative and vary from about 0.4-0.8\noffshore to 0.8-1.2 close to the coast, and in general to the east of the Azores. R CSIRO\n(Figure 5.18 e,f) overestimates temperature in general between 1 and 2oC, and by more\nthan 2oC in the northwestern corner of the domain. SSS differences are mostly between\n0.4 and 0.8, higher along the coast. As for R ENSEM (Figure 5.18 g,h), SST differences\nare mostly within \u00b11oC throughout the domain, and SSS differences are almost always\nlower than 0.4 in module.\n\nFor July (Figure 5.19), the surface mean fields show the signature of coastal upwelling,\nwith a narrow band of cold water (<18oC, Figure 5.19 a) off the entire WIM and a south-\nward deflection of isohalines (Figure 5.19 b) in the same region. Observing the differences,\nall runs present strong negative differences (greater than -5oC) in the Gulf of Cadiz, mean-\ning that all CGCM-forced runs overestimate coastal upwelling in that area with respect\nto the control run. This happens because, unlike the COADS-forced run, they represent\nupwelling as a continuous band of cold coastal water in the Gulf of Cadiz, as if there were\nno gap at the Strait of Gibraltar. Most CGCMs, given their general coarse resolution, have\na single grid point over the Gulf of Cadiz. Over-land air temperature is always higher than\nover-ocean in summer; hence, although a land mask was applied to all CGCM output, and\ngiven that the Gulf of Cadiz grid point is surrounded by land from three sides (and thus\nunder some influence of land temperatures), this land-ocean temperature gradient intensi-\nfies alongshore winds. Indeed, observing the mean wind stress fields for July (Figure 5.13),\nit is clear that at the Gulf of Cadiz, and for all CGCMs, including the ensemble mean, the\nalongshore wind stress is higher than in COADS.\n\nR CCCMA (Figure 5.19 c,d) tends to underestimate temperature relative to R COADS\nnear coastal areas by values higher than 1oC in module, and in the rest of the domain the\nrange in temperature differences is approximately \u00b11oC. Salinity differences vary mostly\nbetween 0.4 and 1.2. R CSIRO (Figure 5.19 e,f) strongly overestimates SST, especially to\nthe north/northwest, reaching a difference of up to 5oC. At the WIM, however, differences\nvary between -1oC and 1oC. In terms of SSS, differences are always positive, mostly\nbetween 0.4 and 1.2. As for R ENSEM (Figure 5.19 g,h), SST differences are mostly\nbetween -2 and 0oC. SSS differences on the other hand are lower than 0.4 in module,\nexcept in the northwestern corner of the domain, the Gulf of Cadiz and north of the\nIberian Peninsula.\n\nFigure 5.20 shows the zonally-averaged seasonal cycle of SST and SSS for the four\nruns. The SST cycle (Figure 5.20, left column) is well reproduced by both R CCCMA and\nR ENSEM, although in the former temperatures south of 35oN are warmer in winter and\ncooler in summer by ? 1oC, and in the latter temperatures south of 34oN are warmer in\nwinter and colder in summer south of 40oN. Also, there is a phase lag of about one month\n\n125\n\n\n\nFigure 5.18: (a,b) Mean SST (oC) and SSS January fields for R COADS; (c-h) Mean\ndifference fields for January of SST (oC) (left column) and SSS (right column) between runs:\n(c,d) R CCCMA minus R COADS; (e,f) R CSIRO minus R COADS; (g,h) R ENSEM\nminus R COADS.\n\n126\n\n\n\nFigure 5.19: Same as Figure 5.18 but for July.\n\n127\n\n\n\nin the temperature cycle. On the other hand, R CSIRO is always warmer, independently\nof the latitude. In winter, temperature differences are ? 1oC in the southern part and\n? 2oC in the northern part, and there is a sudden increase in temperature in spring,\nseen by the vertical N-S orientation of the isotherms especially between May and July:\n2oC (3oC) to the south (north) in one month. Also, there is no meridional temperature\ngradient during summer, and the highest temperature is found at 42oN and not to the\nsouth. In respect to the average SSS cycle (Figure 5.20, right column), R CCCMA does\nnot represent it properly, with differences from 0.8 in winter to 1 in summer. CSIRO\noverestimates salinities by 0.6 (0.4) in the northern (southern) part but the seasonal cycle\nis well reproduced. R ENSEM presents lower values than R COADS, with differences\nof -0.2 in summer/autumn to the south and up to -0.4 to the north, whereas in winter\ndifferences are mostly -0.2.\n\n35.6\n\n35.8\n\n36\n36\n\n36.2\n\n36.4\n\n36 6\n36.8\n\nCOADS S\nla\n\nt \n(o\n\n)\n\nJ F M A M J J A S O N D\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n35\n.2\n\n35.4\n\n35.6\n35.8\n\n35.4\n\n36 36\n\n35\n\nCCCMA S\n\nla\nt (\n\no\n)\n\nJ F M A M J J A S O N D\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n35.8\n\n36\n36\n\n36.2\n\n36.4\n\n36.6\n\n36.8\n\n36.8\n\n37\n37.2\n\n37.4\n\n7\n\nCSIRO S\n\nla\nt \n(o\n\n)\n\nJ F M A M J J A S O N D\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n35.6\n\n35.6\n\n35.8\n\n36\n36\n\n36.2\n\n36.4\n\n35.4\n\n36.6\n\nS\n\nla\nt (\n\no\n)\n\n \n\n \n\nJ F M A M J J A S O N D\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n35 35.4 35.8 36.2 36. 6 37 37.4\n\n14\n\n15\n16\n\n17\n\n17\n\n18\n\n18\n\n1\n9\n\n20\n2122\n\n23\n\nCOADS T\n\nla\nt (\n\no\n)\n\nJ F M A M J J A S O N D\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n12 14\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n17\n\n18\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n2122\n\nCCCMA T\n\nla\nt (\n\no\n)\n\nJ F M A M J J A S O N D\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n1516\n\n17\n\n17\n\n18\n\n18\n\n1\n9 19\n\n2\n0\n\n20\n\n2\n1\n\n2\n1\n\n22\n\n2\n3\n\n2\n4\n\nCSIRO T\n\nla\nt (\n\no\n)\n\nJ F M A M J J A S O N D\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n14\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n17\n\n18\n\n18\n\n1\n9\n\n20\n\n21\n22\n\nT\n\nla\nt (\n\no\n)\n\n \n\n \n\nJ F M A M J J A S O N D\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n12 14 16 18 20 22 24\n\na) b)\n\nc) d)\n\ne) f)\n\ng) h)ENSEM ENSEM\n\nFigure 5.20: Zonally-averaged seasonal cycle of SST (oC) (left column) and SSS (right\ncolumn) to the west of 11oW for run (a,b) R COADS; (c,d) R CCCMA; (e,f) R CSIRO;\n(g,h) R ENSEM.\n\n128\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Azores Current\n\nAs stated before, the Azores Current (AzC) is an important dynamical features of the\nregion, and therefore it is important to achieve a good numerical representation.

The blue lines denote zero u.\n\nConcerning the across section (see Figure 5.17), the associated thermohaline front is in\ngeneral reproduced by ROMS, no matter which surface forcing is applied. R COADS (Fig-\nure 5.22 a,e) shows a primary core centered approximately at 34-34.5oN and a secondary one\nsouth of 33oN. The current is stronger in the upper 350 m but reaches down to 1000 m, and\nits maximum is roughly 6 cm s?1. The variance maximum is mostly between 34 and 35oN\nin the upper 100 m, with maximum values of 8\u00d710?3 m2s?2. R CCCMA (Figure 5.22 b,f)\npresents a strengthened AzC, reaching 7 cm s?1 at the surface and down to 500 m, due\nto the stronger temperature gradient. On the other hand, the variance indicates that the\nAzC does not greatly vary either in latitude or in depth. R CSIRO (Figure 5.22 c,g) re-\nproduces a wider AzC from 33.5oN to 35.5oN, reaching the depths of R CCCMA and the\nvelocity surface values of R COADS. Surface temperature is overestimated by about 1oC.\nIts variance suggests that the AzC core can also be found southward. Finally, R ENSEM\n(Figure 5.22 d,h) apparently presents a less concordant comparison with R COADS con-\ncerning u, with velocities barely reaching 5 cm s?1 in the upper 200 m and a more disperse\nsignature along the section. However, variance shows the strongest variability of the cur-\n\n130\n\n\n\nrent in latitude, and presents the strongest values (10?2 m2s?2) of the four runs centered at\nthe surface at about 33.5oN and 34.5oN. This value in variance means a standard deviation\nof \u00b10.1 m s?1, reflecting a strong seasonal variability of the modeled current. Thus, it\nis possible that the AzC cores are present all the same, but varying strongly in location.\nR ENSEM also presents the best comparison in terms of the temperature distribution in\ndepth.\n\n5.4.3 WIM Cross-shore Sections\n\nFor the cross-shore profiles, we discuss the section along 42oN for January (Figure 5.23)\nand the section along 38oN for July (Figure 5.24) of the ROMS runs. (see Figure 5.17 for\nthe location of the sections). These sections and these months were thus chosen because\nthe Iberian Poleward Current usually associated with wintertime is stronger at northern\nlatitudes. On the other hand, upwelling is fairly similar in intensity along the coast; in\nchoosing a more southern latitude we aim at a complete WIM representation.\n\nFor January (Figure 5.23), the main fields of R COADS show a temperature and salin-\nity signal consistent with the IPC over the slope in the upper layers (? 15oC and ? 36),\nand a low salinity minimum is also visible between 400 and 500 m deep (? 35.6), attributed\nto the ENACW signature. In what concerns temperature (Figure 5.23, left column), the\nmodel that shows the most striking difference is R CSIRO (Figure 5.23 e), where temper-\natures are higher than any of the other simulations, reaching up to 2oC in the upper slope.\nOn the other hand, R CCCMA (Figure 5.23 c) presents a -0.5oC at the upper slope, as\ndoes R ENSEM (Figure 5.23 d) at some points in the upper layers. Concerning salinity\n(Figure 5.23, right column), R CCCMA (Figure 5.23 d) underestimates salinity up to 1\nin the upper 100 m and down to 200 m when approaching the coast, and R CSIRO (Fig-\nure 5.23 f) overestimates it in the same order close to the coast and reaching deeper near\nthe slope (? 350 m). On the contrary, R ENSEM (Figure 5.23 h) shows differences mostly\nlower than -0.2 on the entire section.\n\nFor July, at latitude 38oN (Figure 5.24), the rising of the isotherms and isohalines\nis observed near the coast, typical of upwelling, along again with the fresh signature of\nthe ENACW. There is the same tendency of R CCCMA and R ENSEM to underestimate\nand R CSIRO to overestimate values. In what concerns temperature, R CCCMA (Fig-\nure 5.24 d) presents negative differences in the upper 300 m, strongest at the continental\nshelf/upper slope where they are greater than -2oC. This suggests an overestimation of\nthe upwelling strength. The same behavior is observed for R ENSEM (Figure 5.24 h),\nalthough the differences are less prominent (? 1.5oC at the shelf/slope and lower than 1oC\nmostly elsewhere). On the other hand, R CSIRO (Figure 5.24 f) overestimates strongly\nnot at the upper levels, but rather between 200 and 400 m (500 m close to the slope). The\nmaximum difference of 2oC occurs along roughly 300 m. This suggests that CSIRO does\nnot reproduce well the typical temperatures of the ENACW, which round 12-13oC, thus\nexceeding them by 1 to 2oC.\n\nSalinity shows similar differences to those of January at 42oN: R CCCMA (Figure 5.24\nd) underestimates it by roughly 1 at the surface down to 0.2 at about 300 m; R CSIRO\n\n131\n\n\n\nFigure 5.23: (a,b) Zonal sections of mean temperature (oC) and salinity across 42oN (see\nFigure 5.17) for January for R COADS; (c-h) Sections of mean differences of temperature\n(oC) (left column) and salinity (right column) across 42oN for January between runs: (c,d)\nR CCCMA minus R COADS; (e,f) R CSIRO minus R COADS; (g,h) R ENSEM minus\nR COADS. 132\n\n\n\nFigure 5.24: Same as Figure 5.23 but for July and across 38oN (see Figure 5.17).\n\n133\n\n\n\n(Figure 5.24 f) presents differences of up to 0.8 in the area between 200 and 300 m, the\nsame region where the temperature difference was the highest; R ENSEM (Figure 5.24 h)\nshows more spread negative differences of about 0.2 in the upper 200 m.\n\nFrom the analysis of these sections, we conclude that the difficulties the CGCM-forced\nruns have in reproducing the hydrography, at least in this particular area, are verified\nmostly in the upper 500 m, down to the basis of the central waters. It is also clear that\nR ENSEM is the simulation that presents the lowest differences relative to the control run\n(R COADS).\n\nIn a different approach, we look at horizontal fields of the velocity meridional component\n(v), averaged between the depths of 50 and 100 m (excluding the Ekman layer). At 42oN\n(Figure 5.25), note the all-negative v close to the coast (east of 9.5oW) in R COADS.\nVelocities in the control run associated with the upwelling equatorward jet do not surpass\n10 cm s?1 and occur in average between March and September. As far as the other runs are\nconcerned, in late autumn/winter (from October to March) velocities are positive (about\n5 cm s?1 in R CSIRO \u2014 Figure 5.25 c \u2014 and between 5 and 10 cm s?1 in R CCCMA and\nR ENSEM \u2014 Figure 5.25 b,d) and in summer southward velocities reach 20 cm s?1 for\nR CCCMA and 15 cm s?1 for R CSIRO and R ENSEM. These differences arise from the\ndifferent wind fields between forcing datasets. A comparison between the average seasonal\nwind fields of COADS and of each CGCM including the ensemble (see Figures 5.12 and 5.13,\nand also 5.1, 5.2 f) showed that COADS winter winds have nearly zero zonal components,\nwhereas model winds frequently have a westerly/southwesterly component. On the other\nhand, summer northerly winds are slightly weaker in COADS than in the CGCMs. CGCMs\ncapture the v seasonality such that ROMS simulates northward circulation in winter and\nstronger southward circulation during summer relative to COADS.\n\nOffshore (between 9.5 and 10.5oW) all runs show an almost constant poleward flow,\nwhich reaches its maximum value of 20 cm s?1 in August. Typical of eastern boundary\ncurrent systems, upper slope poleward flows are usually associated with winter circulation\ndue to the presence of summer coastal upwelling. However, as seen in chapter 2, the Iberian\nPoleward Current may exist throughout the year, although occurring more offshore in sum-\nmer. This westward displacement in spring is clear in the R ENSEM field (Figure 5.9 d),\nwith velocities almost always above 5 cm s?1.\n\nAt 38oN (Figure 5.26), the general patterns are similar to those at 42oN, except that the\npoleward flow is weaker, both coastal and more offshore during summer, barely reaching\n15 cm s?1 in August around 10oW. On the other hand, in R CCCMA (Figure 5.26 b) and\nR ENSEM (Figure 5.26 d) the upwelling-associated equatorward jet is stronger, the first\nbeing always higher than 20 cm s?1 from April to November, and the second reaching\n20 cm s?1 in August. R COADS (Figure 5.26 a), however, simulates a weaker upwelling\nrelative to 42oN, and with an inversion of flow direction near the coast in winter, with\nvelocities below 5 cm s?1. R CSIRO (Figure 5.26 c) presents also southward velocities\nlower than at 42oN. The differences in winds as discussed regarding Figure 5.9 also account\nfor these observations.\n\n134\n\n\n\nCOADS \n\nlon (o)\n\nm\no\n\nn\nth\n\ns\n\n \n\n \n\n!13 !12.5 !12 !11.5 !11 !10.5 !10 !9.5 !9\nJ\n\nF\n\nM\n\nA\n\nM\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\nA\n\nS\n\nO\n\nN\n\nD\n\n!0.2\n\n!0.15\n\n!0.1\n\n!0.05\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\nCCCMA \n\nlon (o)\n\nm\no\n\nn\nth\n\ns\n\n \n\n \n\n!13 !12.5 !12 !11.5 !11 !10.5 !10 !9.5 !9\nJ\n\nF\n\nM\n\nA\n\nM\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\nA\n\nS\n\nO\n\nN\n\nD\n\nCSIRO \n\nlon (o)\n\nm\no\n\nn\nth\n\ns\n\n \n\n \n\n!13 !12.5 !12 !11.5 !11 !10.5 !10 !9.5 !9\nJ\n\nF\n\nM\n\nA\n\nM\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\nA\n\nS\n\nO\n\nN\n\nD\n\nlon (o)\n\nm\no\n\nn\nth\n\ns\n\n \n\n \n\n!13 !12.5 !12 !11.5 !11 !10.5 !10 !9.5 !9\nJ\n\nF\n\nM\n\nA\n\nM\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\nA\n\nS\n\nO\n\nN\n\nD\n\nENSEM\n\na) b)\n\nc) d)\n\nFigure 5.25: Seasonal evolution of mean annual meridional velocity v (m s?1), averaged at\n42oN between 50 m and 100 m depth for run (a) R COADS; (b) R CCCMA; (c) R CSIRO;\n(d) R ENSEM.\n\n5.5 Discussion\n\nThe purpose of this work was to evaluate the ability of available CGCM output to force\na regional ocean model configuration. A preliminary inter-comparison was carried out for\nall variables, and an RMSE analysis was performed for each CGCM against the COADS\nclimatology, our control data set. It was clear that there was no consensus in determining\nthe best or the worst model to reproduce climatological values. Different models compared\nbetter with COADS regarding different variables. The ensemble of CGCMs encompasses\na set of values for each variable, and for most variables COADS lies within that range,\nwhich means that the ensemble mean is often very close to the climatological value. Out\nof the nine CGCMs, two were selected to be used as forcing in ROMS simulations. The\nobjective was to choose one that overestimated values in relation to COADS, and another\nthat would underestimate them. In the end we selected CSIRO and CCCMA. The former\nfrequently presents the highest RMSE, while the latter was chosen based on the fact that\n\n135\n\n\n\nCOADS \n\nlon (o)\n\nm\no\n\nn\nth\n\ns\n\n \n\n \n\n!13 !12.5 !12 !11.5 !11 !10.5 !10 !9.5 !9\nJ\n\nF\n\nM\n\nA\n\nM\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\nA\n\nS\n\nO\n\nN\n\nD\n\n!0.2\n\n0.15\n\n!0.1\n\n!0.05\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\nCCCMA \n\nlon (o)\n\nm\no\n\nn\nth\n\ns\n\n \n\n \n\n!13 !12.5 !12 !11.5 !11 !10.5 !10 !9.5 !9\nJ\n\nF\n\nM\n\nA\n\nM\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\nA\n\nS\n\nO\n\nN\n\nD\n\n!\n\nCSIRO \n\nlon (o)\n\nm\no\n\nn\nth\n\ns\n\n \n\n \n\n!13 !12.5 !12 !11.5 !11 !10.5 !10 !9.5 !9\nJ\n\nF\n\nM\n\nA\n\nM\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\nA\n\nS\n\nO\n\nN\n\nD\n\nlon (o)\n\nm\no\n\nn\nth\n\ns\n\n \n\n \n\n!13 !12.5 !12 !11.5 !11 !10.5 !10 !9.5 !9\nJ\n\nF\n\nM\n\nA\n\nM\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\nA\n\nS\n\nO\n\nN\n\nD\n\n!\n\na) b)\n\nc) d) ENSEM\n\nFigure 5.26: Same as Figure 5.25 but for 38oN.\n\nit underestimated SSS the most.\nROMS was forced with these two CGCMs, as well as with the ensemble mean (EN-\n\nSEM), and finally with COADS, which represented the control run. With these four runs\nwe aim at illustrating the entire CGCM range of values. In terms of thermohaline prop-\nerties (Figures 5.19-5.21), it is clear from the ROMS surface fields of temperature and\nsalinity that the ocean model results are strongly dependent on the respective forcing. The\noverestimation of CSIRO and underestimation of CCCMA, particularly of SST and SSS,\nare fed into ROMS, such that the ocean simulations present the same tendencies in the\nupper layers. On this matter, the ensemble mean proves to be the most suitable, as would\nbe expected from the forcing inter-comparison of sections 5.3, in the sense that R ENSEM\nis the run that presents the most similar hydrographical and dynamical fields with respect\nto R COADS (the control run). This is evident in the zonally averaged seasonal signal of\nSST and SSS for the entire domain (Figure 5.21). This result agrees with numerous works\nin the literature, e.g. Pierce et al. (2009), and is attributed to the fact that averaging\nmultiple models may reduce their individual uncertainties and result in an intermediate\nsolution that compares better with climatological values.\n\n136\n\n\n\nThese conclusions also apply to the deeper layers, namely at coastal locations off WIM\n(Figure 5.23-5.26), as far down as 500 m, especially in the case of the CSIRO-forced run.\nAs stated in section 5.3, in this case, the wind stress plays the most important role in the\nintensity variations of the upwelling-associated equatorward jet, as well as the seasonal-\nvarying poleward flow. However, it is worth mentioning the influence that surface forcing\nin regional ocean modeling has on the proper reproduction of intermediate level water\nproperties. Inadequate values of surface input leads not only to incorrect modeled ocean\nsurface patterns / seasonal cycles, but also incorrect intermediate water values, and hence\nwrong derived dynamics.\n\nThe Azores Current is reproduced in all four runs. Although in terms of its mean lo-\ncation they all resemble, in terms of intensity and vertical profile they differ greatly. The\nreason for this may lie with the thermohaline distribution in depth. The CCCMA-forced\nrun presents a steeper front, with lower temperatures/salinities north of 34.5oN and higher\ntemperatures/salinities to the south of 34.5oN, enabling a stronger flow. The CSIRO-forced\nrun, on the other hand, is uniformly warmer/saltier on the whole, as the ensemble-forced\nrun is colder/fresher, thus producing weaker associated currents. Nevertheless, the vari-\nance of the results allows to postulate that all ROMS runs represent well the AzC, but\nthe location of the current varies more throughout the year, which means that its signal\nis not as strong when computing the yearly average. Despite this observation, the impor-\ntance of having proper temperature and salinity (and thus density) vertical distributions\nis reinforced. And since initial and boundary conditions are the same for the four runs, as\nwell as the same numerical configuration, these distributions depend solely on the different\nsurface input provided by each forcing.\n\nWith the CCCMA- and the CSIRO-forced runs we intended to illustrate the range of\npossible ROMS output that the ensemble of nine CGCMs could provide without actually\ncarrying out the nine ROMS simulations. The first conclusion we may draw is that the use\nof forcing obtained from a particular CGCM in an ocean simulation should be considered\nwith caution. Secondly, in light of all considerations, both regarding the CGCM inter-\ncomparison and the ROMS runs, the ensemble mean stands out as the most adequate\nforcing for FD with respect to any other individual CGCM, particularly supported by\nthe results of the R ENSEM simulation, which we have shown that provides the most\nrealistic physical results concerning the hydrography and circulation fields when compared\nto the control run (R COADS) for the present climate. As such, one may postulate that\nsimulations to evaluate future ocean climate change may also legitimately be forced with\nthe ensemble mean; that is, in using the ensemble mean for a future period, we would\nbe aiming at minimizing the uncertainties associated with every individual CGCM. This\napplication is carried out in chapter 6.\n\n137\n\n\n\n138\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nA Future Climate Scenario, part 2:\nClimate Change on the Western\nIberian Margin using ROMS\n\nPart of the contents of this chapter has been published by Cordeiro Pires et al. (2013b).\n\n6.1 Overview\n\nThis chapter consists in a case study of the impacts of a global climate change scenario\non the hydrography and dynamics of the Iberian Upwelling System through numerical\nmodeling.\n\nAs previously stated, given that upwelling systems undergo strong seasonal and in-\nterannual variability, it is also likely they are very sensitive to climate change (Holt et\nal., 2010). The work of Bakun (1990) was one of the earliest studies on the effects of\nclimate change on upwelling systems. The author postulated that a global increase in\nsurface air temperature over land would intensify the land-sea pressure gradient at coastal\nregions, which in turn would cause an intensification of alongshore winds and subsequently\nupwelling. Upwelling intensification would mean cooling of the sea surface temperature\n(SST), which would result in a positive feedback in the land-sea pressure gradient. Since\nthen, several studies have been carried out, based either on SST or wind stress time series\nfrom the last decades. Some of them confirm the Bakun hypothesis while others found a\nweakening of the upwelling signal, depending on the dataset the results are based on and\nthe periods of computation (Narayan et al., 2010). Demarcq (2009) points out that one\nof the main reasons of uncertainty in what concerns upwelling systems is the unknown be-\nhavior of wind patterns in the future, which is the main driver of eastern boundary coastal\ndynamics. Analyzing satellite data, the author found both SST warming and equatorward\nwind strengthening trends in upwelling systems. Particularly for the Iberian Peninsula,\nincreases were estimated to be 0.15oC decade?1 (0.44oC decade?1) in SST for period 1998-\n2007 (2000-2007) and 1 m s?1 decade?1 in equatorward wind for period 2000-2007.\n\n139\n\n\n\nIn what concerns the WIM, the work of Relvas et al. (2009) based on SST data,\nprovides evidence of upwelling enhancement since 1960 based on climatological in situ\ndata, corroborated by satellite data since 1985. However, Santos et al. (2005) (whose\nstudy extends to the entire Eastern North Atlantic Upwelling System) hypothesize a long-\nterm variability behind the strengthening of upwelling from 1990 on. Conversely, Lemos\nand Pires (2004) found a weakening trend for 1941-2000 when analyzing both meridional\nwind component and SST datasets, although punctuated by strong interannual variability.\nA general weakening for both Iberian and Canary upwelling regions was also found by\nPardo et al. (2011) from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data of SST and wind.\n\nWith the numerical modeling tools improvement of the past few years, providing good\nperformances on the reproduction of the dynamics of both the atmosphere and ocean, in\naddition to the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) climate studies, it\nbecame possible to carry out future scenarios in the scope of climate change (Nakic?enovic?\net al., 2000). However, the general circulation models (GCMs) used in this international\neffort are global and therefore have very coarse resolution. Recently, the increased challenge\nhas been to assess global change at a regional scale (Woolings, 2010). Therefore, climate\nstudies have been aiming at the improvement of GCM simulations and the development\nof downscaling techniques toward regional, and thus more realistic, simulations (Hewitson\nand Crane, 1996).\n\nFrom the studies that focus on ocean circulation in a context of future climate change\nscenarios by means of Coupled GCMs (CGCMs), there is a large number that focuses on\nthe thermohaline circulation and the impact of increases in temperature and CO2 con-\ncentration and consequent fresh water input (e.g. Gregory et al., 2005; Stouffer et al.,\n2006). Furthermore, using a set of IPCC CGCMs, Diffenbaugh (2005) assessed the sensi-\ntivity of large-scale eastern boundary currents to increased greenhouse gas concentrations,\ndiscussing the limited ability of global climate models to predict more than the general\npatterns and distribution of atmospheric pressure and surface winds, namely in what con-\ncerns trends and interannual variability. Particularly regarding upwelling systems, Mote\nand Mantua (2002) used two CGCMs to see how the seasonality and intensity of coastal\nupwelling change in the four world systems, whereas Snyder et al. (2003) assessed future\nchanges in upwelling intensity for the California Current System based on CO2 concentra-\ntion increase. However, while the former found no significant change in future years for\nany of the world upwelling systems, the latter obtained results in agreement with Bakun\n(1990) for California, that is, increasing of upwelling intensity and frequency. More re-\ncently, Wang et al. (2010) evaluated the ability of several IPCC CGCMs in reproducing\nupwelling seasonality and what future changes in atmospheric patterns would bring to the\nCanary, the California and the Humboldt upwelling systems, and found the results differed\ngreatly from model to model, with some presenting a weakening of upwelling and others\nshowing intensification. For the WIM, Miranda et al. (2012) carried out a regional ocean\nmodeling study, using a regional atmospheric model as surface forcing, for the A2 IPCC\nscenario and for period 2071-2100, and also found results in agreement with Bakun (1990).\n\nFollowing these works, and the sensitivity study carried out in the previous chapter, the\npresent chapter consists in a comparison between the present mean circulation features of\n\n140\n\n\n\nthe upper levels along the western coast of the Iberian Peninsula described in chapter 2 and\nthe dynamics imposed by a set of atmospheric conditions dictated by a future circulation\nregime; in this case, based on the multi-model ensemble mean.\n\n6.2 Data and Methodology\n\n  12\no\nW   10\n\no\nW    8\n\no\nW    6\n\no\nW \n\n  36\no\nN \n\n  38\no\nN \n\n  40\no\nN \n\n  42\no\nN \n\n  44\no\nN \n\nFigure 6.1: SD, with the several study locations of this chapter.

Green dots: UI\nmeasurement locations (Figure 6.11). Isobaths 200 m and 2000 m are shown in black and\n1000 m in gray.\n\nThe choice of forcing for this study underwent several steps. In the first approach, the\ngoal was to find one global climate model that would compare well with our climatological\nrun of chapter 2, and which would consequently provide reasonable future forcing for the\n\n141\n\n\n\nscenario study. However, when we started to analyze the nine CGCM forcing (as described\nin chapter 5), we soon realized that there was not one that outstood from the others, one\nthat would solely provide the best comparisons to the climatology when all variables were\ntaken into account. One would better represent radiation fluxes but be poor in E-P, the\nother would be better in SST and SSS but be poor in SLP. That is why, in the end, the\nmulti-model ensemble mean was the selected future forcing; because in averaging the input\nfrom all CGCMs we believe we are minimizing their uncertainties.\n\nThe results are presented first showing the differences between the ensemble present-\nforced run and the COADS-forced run, and then between the ensemble future-forced run\nand the ensemble present-forced run, which will be addressed as a possible future ocean\nscenario, having validated first the present ensemble as adequate forcing.\n\nFor this study, ROMS is setup using the same configuration of chapter 2: offline nesting,\nclimatologically-forced, with FD providing initial and boundary conditions for SD. Three\nruns are taken into consideration: the one described in chapter 2, with COADS as surface\nforcing, which consists in the control run; one forced with a climatology constructed for\nthe same period as COADS, that it, 1945-1989, from the multi-model ensemble mean;\nand one forced with a future climatology (2071-2100), also constructed from the ensemble\nmean. The methodology used to obtain these climatologies is the same as described in the\nprevious chapter (section 5.2). The CGCMs that compose the multi-model ensemble mean\nare listed in Table 5.1. As mentioned in chapter 5, the ensemble-forced FD runs are fed\nwith the same initial and boundary conditions as the COADS-forced run, since the vertical\nhydrographical fields provided by the CGCMs were not realistic (not shown).\n\nThe chosen emission scenario from the IPCC future climate projections assessment\nreport from 2007 (AR4) was the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 scenario\n(Nakic?enovic? et al., 2000). The SRES scenarios are grouped into four scenario families (A1,\nA2, B1 and B2) that explore alternative development pathways, covering a wide range\nof demographic, economic and technological driving forces and resulting greenhouse gas\nemissions. The SRES scenarios do not include additional climate policies above current\nones. They can be summarized as follows:\n\n\u2022 A1: assumes a world of very rapid economic growth, a global population that peaks\nin mid-century and rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies. A1 is\ndivided into three groups that describe alternative directions of technological change:\nfossil intensive (A1FI), non-fossil energy resources (A1T) and a balance across all\nsources (A1B).\n\n\u2022 B1: describes a convergent world, with the same global population as A1, but with\nmore rapid changes in economic structures toward a service and information economy.\n\n\u2022 B2: describes a world with intermediate population and economic growth, empha-\nsizing local solutions to economic, social, and environmental sustainability.\n\n\u2022 A2: describes a very heterogeneous world with high population growth, slow economic\ndevelopment and slow technological change.\n\n142\n\n\n\nThe A2 scenario is the most \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d approach, where the basic social, eco-\nnomical and technological behavior is maintained throughout the period under study (2001-\n2100). There is not a scenario more likely than the other; the four encompass equally\npossible changes in society. This choice was based on two factors. First, in the beginning\nof this study, we had no idea what to expect either from the CGCM output or from the\nROMS simulations. Hence, the tendency was to choose a scenario where changes would\nbe marked; that is, one of the \u201cworst\u201d scenarios. Secondly, A2 along with A1B seem to be\nthe scenarios which are most frequently applied, based on the literature.\n\n6.3 Results\n\nFor the analysis of the mean hydrography of the region, the following sub-sections\npresent: seasonal maps of wind stress; monthly-mean fields of SST and SSS; cross-shore\nsections of temperature, salinity and meridional velocity along the WIM; the seasonal\ncycle of SST, SSS and the upwelling index. This is carried out for the three runs. For\nthe horizontal and vertical slices, ROMS output was processed for January and July as\nmonthly averages from the last 5 years of a 10-year simulation.\n\n6.3.1 Seasonal Wind Stress\n\nWind stress is one of the most important variables that must be well modeled for\na good reproduction of both hydrography and circulation. That is why it is described\nfirst of all. Observing Figure 6.2, the ensemble presents roughly a meridional gradient,\nwhereas in COADS wind stress varies along a NW-SE axis in winter and autumn and\nalong a NE-SW axis in spring and summer. Furthermore, while in winter the ensemble\nshows a clear south/southwesterly wind stress component, COADS wind stress is mostly\neastward and southeastward. That is, there are never downwelling-favorable conditions\naccording to COADS, which means that this forcing does not comprise e.g. strong storm\nconditions associated with low-pressure systems, typical of winter. In spring, COADS\nalready presents a clear tendency for equatorward winds, whereas the ensemble wind,\nalthough showing a southward component, is mostly directed onshore. In summer, the\nensemble presents stronger wind stress, especially south of 42oN, and in autumn COADS\nand present ensemble have similar patterns as during wintertime, that is, an eastward and\nsoutheastward tendency in COADS and relatively strong north/northeastward winds in\nthe ensemble. In the future, wind stress distribution remains mostly zonal, but enhanced,\nespecially to the north in winter and autumn and to the south in spring and summer.\nIn winter and autumn, south of 40oN, wind stress has a stronger southward component,\nparticularly noticeable in the Gulf of Cadiz. In summer, the strengthening is striking south\nof 41oN, with an increase of wind stress intensity of >0.02 N m?2.\n\nThe absence of a clear inversion on the wind direction in COADS as opposed to the\npresent ensemble will strongly influence the differences between the two runs, since the\nwind stress plays a key role in dictating the thermohaline structure of the coastal ocean\n\n143\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Wind stress (N m?2) seasonal fields for COADS (left column), present ensemble\n(middle column), and future ensemble (right column).

Nevertheless, it is important to have a \u201ccontrol run\u201d against\nwhich to test our hypothesis, and as described in chapter 2 the COADS-forced SD run\ntraces a reasonably accurate portrait of the WIM hydrography and dynamics.\n\n6.3.2 Surface Fields\n\nFigure 6.3 presents SST (upper row) and SSS (lower row) fields for January, from the\nthree runs: COADS (Figure 6.3 a,f), present ensemble (Figure 6.3 b,g) and future ensemble\n(Figure 6.3 c,h). Also represented are the difference fields between the ensemble and\nCOADS (Figure 6.3 d,i) and between future and present of the ensemble (Figure 6.3 e,j).\nFigure 6.4 shows the same but for July. The differences between the control run and the\npresent ensemble will be addressed first, and then the differences between present ensemble\nand future ensemble. Note the different color scale in the difference fields.\n\nIn winter (Figure 6.3), the present ensemble reproduces well the coastal warm and saline\ntongue typical of the slope poleward flow, with the 13oC isotherm and the 35.7 isohaline\nfollowing the bathymetry along the northern coast of the WIM. On the other hand, COADS\nshows more clearly the low temperature (<12.5oC) and low salinity (<35.7) band along the\ncoast north of the Estremadura Promontory. While low salinities are usually attributed to\nwinter river discharge, these low temperatures nearshore are due to winter cooling in the\ncontinental shelf. This is also observed in the ensemble, but along a much narrower coastal\nband, perhaps more restricted to the coast due to the presence of the stronger and well\ndefined poleward flow, that can partially overcome these lower temperatures and salinities.\nThat is why the alongshore differences (Figure 6.3 d,i) are positive. Furthermore, there\nare generalized SSS negative differences offshore (-0.15 to -0.25).\n\nIn summer, both SST (Figure 6.4 a,b) and SSS (Figure 6.4 f,g) distributions are similar\nwhen comparing present ensemble and COADS. Coastal upwelling is overestimated by the\nformer in SST with a clearly wider cold-water band along the western coast, most likely due\nto the stronger equatorward winds (see Figure 6.2). In the ensemble runs, upwelling occurs\nas if there were no land interruption at the Strait of Gibraltar. This has been discussed in\nthe previous chapter: most CGCMs, given their general coarse resolution, have a single grid\npoint over the Gulf of Cadiz, and hence do not reproduce well the winds at this location.\nThis accounts for the SST and SSS differences in the Gulf of Cadiz, including along the\nsouthern coast of Portugal. Note that in the northwestern tip of the Iberian Peninsula\nupwelling is enhanced in SSS and weakened in SST by the ensemble.\n\nFor the future, the general tendency is for warming and for freshening of the ocean\nsurface. In winter (Figure 6.3), the SST increase is stronger near the coast (+2oC in\nnorthern WIM and +2.5oC in southern WIM) and the SSS decrease is stronger offshore\n(-0.2 in the northern quadrant, reaching -0.4 in the Gulf of Cadiz). The temperature\nand salinity anomalies associated with the poleward flow surface signature are still visible,\nalthough with higher temperatures and lower salinities along its path, relative to the present\nensemble. Note that both temperature and salinity onshore-offshore anomalies are similar\nto the present, although the absolute values increase (decrease) in temperature (salinity).\n\nIn summer (Figure 6.4), the opposite occurs in SST: differences are greater offshore (up\n\n146\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: SST (upper row, oC) and SSS (lower row) mean fields for January, from the\nthree runs: COADS (a,f), present ensemble (b,g) and future ensemble (c,h).

For\nSSS, the strongest differences remain offshore, up to -0.4 to the north and -0.2 to the south,\nand are lower onshore (lower than -0.1 along northern WIM and about -0.15 along southern\nWIM). The cross-shore gradient associated with coastal upwelling is enhanced and wider,\ndue to the higher warming rate of temperatures offshore than onshore. Nevertheless, note\nthat the width of the upwelling band has not increased, as could be expected from the\nstrengthening of upwelling-favorable winds observed in Figure 6.2. It has even decreased\nin the southern WIM. This will be further discussed in the following section.\n\nThese results are expectable, since the basis of the IPCC A2 scenario is a global rise\nin surface air temperatures, which has as consequence among many others freshwater\ninput from melting icecaps in the poles (Huybrechts et al., 2004). Furthermore, the higher\nwarming rate along the southern WIM than along the northern WIM is consistent with the\ntrends found by Relvas et al. (2009) when analyzing SST time series for period 1960-2005,\nas well as satellite data from 1985 to 2008 and buoy data from 1960 to 2003.\n\n6.3.3 WIM Cross-shore Sections\n\nThe following analysis concerns cross-shore sections at two latitudes off WIM: 42oN\nand 38oN, where temperature, salinity and meridional velocity mean fields for January and\nJuly are analyzed for each of the runs: COADS, present ensemble and future ensemble.\nAs before, the present runs are compared first, and then follows the comparison between\nfuture and present of the ensemble.\n\nThe vertical hydrographical fields are presented in Figure 6.5 for January and in Fig-\nure 6.6 for July. Analyzing first the northern section in winter, COADS (Figure 6.5 a)\npresents a tendency for low temperatures and salinities nearshore (note the upward of the\nisotherms), consistent with the coastal narrow band of low temperatures and salinities\nobserved in Figure 6.3 attributed to winter cooling and river discharge, respectively. The\nensemble (Figure 6.5 b) shows in part lower salinities, and a warmer core that is formed\nnearshore (closed isotherm 13.5oC centered at 9.2oW), the signature of the poleward flow\nseen also in Figure 6.3. Onshore, temperatures are again 13oC.\n\nAt 38oN, for the upper 200 m, the surface coastal waters in the ensemble are warmer\nby 0.5oC and isotherms are less steep at the upper slope, although an upward of isotherms\nis visible in both runs. With respect to salinity, at the upper 200 m, it is generally\nunderestimated by the ensemble by 0.1-0.2.\n\nBelow 200 m, for both latitudes, the present ensemble (Figure 6.5 b,e) represents the\nwell temperature field. At 42oN, the salinity general distribution is well captured, although\nthe ensemble underestimates values by ? 0.1 at 42oN, especially noticeable at the MW\nlevels (800-1200 m). At these levels for section 38oN, on the other hand, the ensemble\nshows good results in the reproduction of the MW salinity.\n\nIn summer (Figure 6.6), below 200 m, the differences between the two present simula-\ntions are similar to those of winter: the temperature distribution compares well and salinity\nis underestimated by the ensemble by about 0.1, especially striking at the depths of the\nMW (800-1200 m). In the upper 200 m, while at 42oN temperature in the ensemble still\n\n149\n\n\n\n12\n.5\n\n13\n\n13\n\n13\n.5\n\na)\n 4\n\n2o\nN\n\n, C\nO\n\nA\nD\n\nS\n,

0.3, consistent with a stronger and\nwider upwelling observed in Figure 6.4.\n\nFor the future (Figures 6.5,6.6 c,f), below 300 m, in January there are no significant\nchanges neither in temperature nor in salinity; but in July, although overall the same\nvertical structure of T and S over the slope is observed, there is a difference of roughly\n0.1 in salinity at the depths of the MW. In the upper 300 m, in winter, temperatures are\n0.5oC higher at deeper levels and the difference increases up to +1.5oC at the surface and\nnear the coast. In summer, near the coast the cross-shore gradient is clearly stronger,\nand offshore in the upper 100 m temperatures are up to +2oC warmer. In what concerns\nsalinity, differences are more striking, from about -0.1 in winter to -0.3-0.4 in summer.\nNote that at 38oN the highest negative anomalies are at the subsurface, while a saltier lens\nis placed at the surface. We have observed in Figure 6.4 that at the southern WIM the\nupwelling band was considerably narrower in the future.\n\nFigures 6.7 and 6.8 present zonal vertical slices at the same sections of meridional\nvelocity for January and July, respectively, again for the three runs. For the present in\nJanuary, at 42oN (Figure 6.7 a,b), the ensemble shows stronger poleward flow than COADS,\nconsistent with what was observed in both surface fields and zonal sections of T and S.\nThere is also an offshore reverse in flow direction.\n\nAt 38oN (Figure 6.7 d,e), the flow patterns are similar, with weak poleward flow ten-\ndency at the upper slope, some equatorward flow throughout the water column at the\n400 m isobath (weaker in the ensemble than in COADS), and then poleward flow at mid-\ndepths corresponding to the MW flow and equatorward flow offshore, both enhanced in the\nensemble. In July (Figure 6.8), at both latitudes, the ensemble shows stronger and wider\nupwelling, with velocities higher than 5 cm s?1 reaching deeper levels (400 m as opposed to\n100 m in COADS). The poleward flow from the surface down to the slope between 9.5oW\nand 10oW is equally strong at 38oN, but weaker at 42oN.\n\nThe differences between present and future in winter (Figure 6.7 c,f) are not very\nstriking. There is a more generalized tendency for poleward flow at 42oN, and at 38oN\nthere is a shift of the poleward flow maximum from mid-depths to the subsurface (?\n10 cm s?1). In summer (Figure 6.8 c,f), although upwelling intensifies at the surface by\nabout 5?10 cm s?1, its width and depth decrease, seen by the more restricted equatorward\njet, reaching down to 300 m at 42oN and 100 m at 38oN in depth instead of 600 m in the\npresent, and also much closer to the coast. To compensate, the poleward flow occupies\nmost of the slope and is wider at the surface.\n\nAs suggested by Figures 6.4 and 6.6, the upwelling band is narrower and shallower in\nthe future, although with stronger equatorward velocities, likely due to the intensification\nof the equatorward winds (Figure 6.2). This limitation in width and depth of upwelling\nmay be explained by the different offshore-onshore warming rates (lower temperature rise\nnear the coast than in the open ocean) and the consequent strengthening of the upper level\nstratification. On the other hand, there is an intensification of poleward flow adjacent to\nthe upwelling band, especially at 42oN.\n\n152\n\n\n\na)\n 4\n\n2o\nN\n\n, C\nO\n\nA\nD\n\nS\n, J\n\nan\n\n!2\n00\n\n!1\n50\n\n!1\n00!5\n\n00\n\nlo\nng\n\nitu\nde\n\n (o\n)\n\ndepth (m)\n\n!1\n0.\n\n6\n!1\n\n0.\n4\n\n!1\n0.\n\n2\n!1\n\n0\n!9\n\n.8\n!9\n\n.6\n!9\n\n.4\n!9\n\n.2\n!9\n\n!8\n.8\n\n!1\n40\n\n0\n\n!1\n20\n\n0\n\n!1\n00\n\n0\n\n!8\n00\n\n!6\n00\n\n!4\n00\n\n!2\n00\n\nd)\n 3\n\n8o\nN\n\n, C\nO\n\nA\nD\n\nS\n, J\n\nan\n\n!2\n00\n\n!1\n50\n\n!1\n00!5\n\n00\n\nlo\nng\n\nitu\nde\n\n (o\n)\n\ndepth (m)\n\n!1\n0.\n\n6\n!1\n\n0.\n4\n\n!1\n0.\n\n2\n!1\n\n0\n!9\n\n.8\n!9\n\n.6\n!9\n\n.4\n!9\n\n.2\n!9\n\n!8\n.8\n\n!1\n40\n\n0\n\n!1\n20\n\n0\n\n!1\n00\n\n0\n\n!8\n00\n\n!6\n00\n\n!4\n00\n\n!2\n00\n\nb)\n 4\n\n2o\nN\n\n, E\nns\n\nem\n p\n\nre\ns,\n\n J\nan\n\n!2\n00\n\n!1\n50\n\n!1\n00!5\n\n00\n\nlo\nng\n\nitu\nde\n\n (o\n)\n\ndepth (m)\n\n!1\n0.\n\n6\n!1\n\n0.\n4\n\n!1\n0.\n\n2\n!1\n\n0\n!9\n\n.8\n!9\n\n.6\n!9\n\n.4\n!9\n\n.2\n!9\n\n!8\n.8\n\n!1\n40\n\n0\n\n!1\n20\n\n0\n\n!1\n00\n\n0\n\n!8\n00\n\n!6\n00\n\n!4\n00\n\n!2\n00\n\ne)\n 3\n\n8o\nN\n\n, E\nns\n\nem\n p\n\nre\ns,\n\n J\nan\n\n!2\n00\n\n!1\n50\n\n!1\n00!5\n\n00\n\nlo\nng\n\nitu\nde\n\n (o\n)\n\ndepth (m)\n\n!1\n0.\n\n6\n!1\n\n0.\n4\n\n!1\n0.\n\n2\n!1\n\n0\n!9\n\n.8\n!9\n\n.6\n!9\n\n.4\n!9\n\n.2\n!9\n\n!8\n.8\n\n!1\n40\n\n0\n\n!1\n20\n\n0\n\n!1\n00\n\n0\n\n!8\n00\n\n!6\n00\n\n!4\n00\n\n!2\n00\n\nc)\n 4\n\n2o\nN\n\n, E\nns\n\nem\n fu\n\nt, \nJa\n\nn\n\n!2\n00\n\n!1\n50\n\n!1\n00!5\n\n00\n\nlo\nng\n\nitu\nde\n\n (o\n)\n\ndepth (m)\n\n!1\n0.\n\n6\n!1\n\n0.\n4\n\n!1\n0.\n\n2\n!1\n\n0\n!9\n\n.8\n!9\n\n.6\n!9\n\n.4\n!9\n\n.2\n!9\n\n!8\n.8\n\n!1\n40\n\n0\n\n!1\n20\n\n0\n\n!1\n00\n\n0\n\n!8\n00\n\n!6\n00\n\n!4\n00\n\n!2\n00\n\nf) \n38\n\no N\n, E\n\nns\nem\n\n fu\nt, \n\nJa\nn\n\n!2\n00\n\n!1\n50\n\n!1\n00!5\n\n00\n\nlo\nng\n\nitu\nde\n\n (o\n)\n\ndepth (m)\n\n \n\n \n\n!1\n0.\n\n6\n!1\n\n0.\n4\n\n!1\n0.\n\n2\n!1\n\n0\n!9\n\n.8\n!9\n\n.6\n!9\n\n.4\n!9\n\n.2\n!9\n\n!8\n.8\n\n!1\n40\n\n0\n\n!1\n20\n\n0\n\n!1\n00\n\n0\n\n!8\n00\n\n!6\n00\n\n!4\n00\n\n!2\n00\n\n!0\n.3\n\n!0\n.2\n\n5\n\n!0\n.2\n\n!0\n.1\n\n5\n\n!0\n.1\n\n!0\n.0\n\n5\n\n00.\n05\n\n0.\n1\n\n0.\n15\n\nFigure 6.7: Zonal vertical sections at 42oN (upper row) and 38oN (lower row) of the mean\nmeridional velocity component (m s?1) for January, from the three runs: COADS (a,f),\npresent ensemble (b,g) and future ensemble (c,h).\n\n153\n\n\n\na)\n 4\n\n2o\nN\n\n, C\nO\n\nA\nD\n\nS\n, J\n\nul\n\n!2\n00\n\n!1\n50\n\n!1\n00!5\n\n00\n\nlo\nng\n\nitu\nde\n\n (o\n)\n\ndepth (m)\n\n!1\n0.\n\n6\n!1\n\n0.\n4\n\n!1\n0.\n\n2\n!1\n\n0\n!9\n\n.8\n!9\n\n.6\n!9\n\n.4\n!9\n\n.2\n!9\n\n!8\n.8\n\n!1\n40\n\n0\n\n!1\n20\n\n0\n\n!1\n00\n\n0\n\n!8\n00\n\n!6\n00\n\n!4\n00\n\n!2\n00\n\nd)\n 3\n\n8o\nN\n\n, C\nO\n\nA\nD\n\nS\n, J\n\nul\n\n!2\n00\n\n!1\n50\n\n!1\n00!5\n\n00\n\nlo\nng\n\nitu\nde\n\n (o\n)\n\ndepth (m)\n\n!1\n0.\n\n6\n!1\n\n0.\n4\n\n!1\n0.\n\n2\n!1\n\n0\n!9\n\n.8\n!9\n\n.6\n!9\n\n.4\n!9\n\n.2\n!9\n\n!8\n.8\n\n!1\n40\n\n0\n\n!1\n20\n\n0\n\n!1\n00\n\n0\n\n!8\n00\n\n!6\n00\n\n!4\n00\n\n!2\n00\n\nb)\n 4\n\n2o\nN\n\n, E\nns\n\nem\n p\n\nre\ns,\n\n J\nul\n\n!2\n00\n\n!1\n50\n\n!1\n00!5\n\n00\n\nlo\nng\n\nitu\nde\n\n (o\n)\n\ndepth (m)\n\n!1\n0.\n\n6\n!1\n\n0.\n4\n\n!1\n0.\n\n2\n!1\n\n0\n!9\n\n.8\n!9\n\n.6\n!9\n\n.4\n!9\n\n.2\n!9\n\n!8\n.8\n\n!1\n40\n\n0\n\n!1\n20\n\n0\n\n!1\n00\n\n0\n\n!8\n00\n\n!6\n00\n\n!4\n00\n\n!2\n00\n\ne)\n 3\n\n8o\nN\n\n, E\nns\n\nem\n p\n\nre\ns,\n\n J\nul\n\n!2\n00\n\n!1\n50\n\n!1\n00!5\n\n00\n\nlo\nng\n\nitu\nde\n\n (o\n)\n\ndepth (m)\n\n!1\n0.\n\n6\n!1\n\n0.\n4\n\n!1\n0.\n\n2\n!1\n\n0\n!9\n\n.8\n!9\n\n.6\n!9\n\n.4\n!9\n\n.2\n!9\n\n!8\n.8\n\n!1\n40\n\n0\n\n!1\n20\n\n0\n\n!1\n00\n\n0\n\n!8\n00\n\n!6\n00\n\n!4\n00\n\n!2\n00\n\nc)\n 4\n\n2o\nN\n\n, E\nns\n\nem\n fu\n\nt, \nJu\n\nl\n\n!2\n00\n\n!1\n50\n\n!1\n00!5\n\n00\n\nlo\nng\n\nitu\nde\n\n (o\n)\n\ndepth (m)\n\n!1\n0.\n\n6\n!1\n\n0.\n4\n\n!1\n0.\n\n2\n!1\n\n0\n!9\n\n.8\n!9\n\n.6\n!9\n\n.4\n!9\n\n.2\n!9\n\n!8\n.8\n\n!1\n40\n\n0\n\n!1\n20\n\n0\n\n!1\n00\n\n0\n\n!8\n00\n\n!6\n00\n\n!4\n00\n\n!2\n00\n\nf) \n38\n\no N\n, E\n\nns\nem\n\n fu\nt, \n\nJu\nl\n\n!2\n00\n\n!1\n50\n\n!1\n00!5\n\n00\n\nlo\nng\n\nitu\nde\n\n (o\n)\n\ndepth (m)\n\n \n\n \n\n!1\n0.\n\n6\n!1\n\n0.\n4\n\n!1\n0.\n\n2\n!1\n\n0\n!9\n\n.8\n!9\n\n.6\n!9\n\n.4\n!9\n\n.2\n!9\n\n!8\n.8\n\n!1\n40\n\n0\n\n!1\n20\n\n0\n\n!1\n00\n\n0\n\n!8\n00\n\n!6\n00\n\n!4\n00\n\n!2\n00\n\n!0\n.3\n\n!0\n.2\n\n5\n\n!0\n.2\n\n!0\n.1\n\n5\n\n!0\n.1\n\n!0\n.0\n\n5\n\n00.\n05\n\n0.\n1\n\n0.\n15\n\nFigure 6.8: Same as Figure 6.7 but for July.\n\n154\n\n\n\n6.3.4 Seasonal Analysis\n\nFrom the previous sections it becomes clear that future changes depend on the month\nand also on the distance from the coast. In this section, these differences are analyzed from\na seasonal point of view, as well as a function of longitude.\n\nFigure 6.9 presents the seasonal evolution of sea surface temperature (SST \u2014 left\ncolumn) and salinity (SSS \u2014 right column) for present and future at the five points\nmarked on Figure 6.1, located at the 100-m isobath. The strongest differences are observed\nin winter and autumn, and the lowest during spring and summer. SST does not present\na sinusoidal-like evolution such as would be expected offshore. On the contrary, at these\npoints, minimum temperatures are registered between February and April, and a second\nminimum is reached between June and August. The highest temperatures are observed\nin autumn, when the northerly winds begin to relax after the upwelling season. These\npeaks also occur in the future, although enhanced. The SST difference for months May\nto August is of +1oC, while for the remaining months the difference is about +2oC. In\nOctober at 40oN, differences reach +2.5oC, whereas at 41oN and 42oN the lowest differences\nare found in August and September (0-0.5oC). Concerning SSS, the general difference\nbetween present and future is of -0.2. Moreover, while at present the SSS minimum is\nreached in July (with the exception of the 42oN section, where this minimum is observed\nin September), in the future the lowest SSS is found in May for the southern sections and\nalso in September for the northern sections. May is the month where the future-present\ndifference is the highest, reaching -0.3. The May and September double low peak results\nin a summer increase of salinity, which, being absent in the present series, means a lower\ndifference (about -0.1) between present and future for these months.\n\nFrom Figure 6.9 it is evident that the temperature and salinity seasonal evolution\ndepend on latitude, but these variables may also depend on longitude. Hence, monthly\nmean plots of SST and SSS future minus present differences along longitude are shown on\nFigure 6.10, averaged along three latitudinal bands: 41-43oN, 39-41oN and 37-39oN.\n\nIn what concerns temperature, from a first observation, there is not a striking difference\nbetween offshore/near shore locations. At the northern band (Figure 6.10 a), the general\ndifference is of +1 to +1.5oC. The exception is between July and September, where a\ndifference as low as zero can be found centered at 9.3oW, the average location of the 100-m\nisobath at that latitudinal band (see Figure 6.1), where the upwelling jet is the strongest (as\ndiscussed further on). Onshore, differences reach the highest (+2oC) difference in winter\nand the lowest (+0.5oC) in summer. At the central band (Figure 6.10 c), differences are\nof mostly +1.5oC except for the upwelling season (May to September), where they are in\ngeneral lower, being the lowest (<0.5oC) close to the coast. Concerning the southernmost\nband (Figure 6.10 e), the strongest differences are again around 9.2-9.3oW, with differences\nreaching +2-3oC between August and October. The early summer interval (May-July) is\nonce more the one that presents the lowest SST differences (+1-1.5oC).\n\nIn what concerns salinity (Figure 6.10 b,d,f), the northern band shows strong negative\ndifferences offshore between May and November (from -0.25 to -0.35), while near shore\nduring summer differences are again the lowest.

Finally, at the southern band, the coastal summer low differences of\nabout -0.1 are displaced toward offshore longitudes.\n\nFrom these observations we can draw that, despite the warmer temperatures in about\n2oC and fresher waters in about 0.2 in the future, these differences are smaller near the\ncoast and during the upwelling season. This confirms the different SST increase between\ncoastal and offshore locations, responsible for strengthening of the upper layer stratification.\nNevertheless, the surface mean fields and WIM cross-sections revealed that upwelling did\nnot weaken, which could be expected from this increase in stratification. Furthermore, it\nis interesting to note that SST and SSS strong/weak differences do not exactly correspond\nin time. For instances, the coastal SST minimum differences occur in May-June, while\ncoastal SSS minimum differences occur in July-August.\n\nGiven these previous SST and SSS considerations concerning upwelling, and since the\nlatter is strongly dependent of wind stress, we look now at the upwelling index (UI). As\ndefined in section 3.2.1, UI is a measure of favorable or unfavorable upwelling conditions.\nOne of its formulations is based on the cross-shore Ekman transport derived from wind\nstress (Bakun, 1973), which given the quasi-meridional orientation of the WIM, can be\nconsidered to be solely the Ekman transport zonal component Qx, which is given by the\nfollowing equation:\n\nQx =\n?y\n?wf\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere ?y = ?aCD|W|Wy is the meridional wind stress component (?a ? 1.22 kg m?3\nis the air density, CD an adimensional drag coefficient (variable, dependent on the wind\nintensity \u2014 Large and Pond, 1981), |W| is the module of the wind at 10 m, and Wy\nits meridional component), ?w is the average density of seawater (? 1025 kg m?3), and\nf = 2? sin(?) is the Coriolis parameter (? is the angular velocity of the Earth and ? the\nlatitude). UI = ?Qx is multiplied by a factor of 1000, so that the measure translates a\ndisplacement of volume for each kilometer of coast (m3s?1km?1). UI is positive when the\nEkman transport is oriented offshore (i.e. westward) and thus upwelling-favorable, and\nnegative when the Ekman transport is onshore (eastward) and thus downwelling-favorable.\n\nFigure 6.11 shows the seasonal upwelling index computed at three points along the\nWIM (see Figure 6.1) for the three runs: COADS, present ensemble and future ensemble.\nFirst of all, there is a striking difference between COADS and ensemble, with the former\npresenting a double peak in April and July and the latter in July only. Also, the COADS\nUI is always positive, that is, upwelling-favorable throughout the year, whereas the ensem-\nble shows a stronger seasonality, with downwelling-favorable conditions from November to\nApril. This was already observed in the seasonal wind stress fields (Figure 6.2). The differ-\nences between present and future are basically an enhancement toward upwelling-favorable\nconditions: in autumn/winter UI is less negative, that is, less downwelling-favorable, and\nin spring/summer is higher. Also, the upwelling season seems to start earlier (April instead\nof May) and end later (October instead of September), at least in the southernmost point.\nNote that in the northernmost point future UI equals the COADS peak for June and July\n\n157\n\n\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2 2\n\n2\n2\n\n22\n2\n\n1.5\n1.5\n\n1.5\n1.51.5\n\n2.5\n2.5\n\n2.5\n\n2.52.5\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n3\n\n11\n\n1\n\n2\n\nlon (\no\n\n)\n\nm\no\n\nn\nth\n\ns\n\nSST (fut!pres) 37!39\no\n\nN\n\n \n\n \n\n!9.9 !9.8 !9.7 !9.6 !9.5 !9.4 !9.3 !9.2 !9.1 !9 !8.9\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n!0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n11\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n1.5\n1.51.5\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n1.5 1.5\n\n1\n.5\n\n2\n2 2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\nlon (\no\n\n)\n\nm\no\n\nn\nth\n\ns\n\nSST (fut!pres) 39!41\no\n\nN\n\n!9.9 !9.8 !9.7 !9.6 !9.5 !9.4 !9.3 !9.2 !9.1 !9 !8.9\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n\n1.5\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n1.5\n\n1.5\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n1.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n2\n\n2\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\nSST (fut!pres) 41!43\no\n\nN\n\nlon (\no\n\n)\n\nm\no\n\nn\nth\n\ns\n\n!9.9 !9.8 !9.7 !9.6 !9.5 !9.4 !9.3 !9.2 !9.1 !9 !8.9\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\na)\n\nc)\n\ne)\n\n!0.25\n!0.25\n\n!0.25\n!0.25\n\n!0.25\n!0.25\n\n!0.2\n\n!0.2\n!0.2\n\n!0.2\n\n!0.\n2!0.2\n\n!0.15\n!0.15 !0.15\n\n!0.15!0.15\n!0.15\n\n!0.2 !0.2\n!0.2\n\n!0.15\n\n!0.15!0.15\n\n!0.15 !0.15\n\n!0.1!0.1\n!0.1\n\n!0.1\n\n!0.2\n\n!0.1\n\nlon (\no\n\n)\n\nSSS (fut!pres) 37!39\no\n\nN\n\n \n\n \n\n!9.9 !9.8 !9.7 !9.6 !9.5 !9.4 !9.3 !9.2 !9.1 !9 !8.9\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n!0.3 !0.25 !0.2 !0.15 !0.1 !0.05\n\n!0.25\n\n!0.2 !0.2 !0.2\n\n!0.2\n\n!0.2\n\n!0.2\n\n!0.2\n\n!0.15\n\n!0.15\n\n!0.15 !0.15\n\n!0.15\n\n!0.15\n\n!0.15\n\n!0.15\n\n!0.15!0.15\n\n!0.1\n\nlon (\no\n\n)\n\nSSS (fut!pres) 39!41\no\n\nN\n\n!9.9 !9.8 !9.7 !9.6 !9.5 !9.4 !9.3 !9.2 !9.1 !9 !8.9\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n!0.3 !0.3\n\n!0.3\n\n!0.3!0.3\n\n!0.25 !0.25\n\n!0.25\n\n!0.25\n!0.25\n\n!0.2 !0.2 !0.2\n\n!0.2\n\n!0.2\n\n!0.2\n\n!0.2\n!0.2!0.2\n\n!0.15\n\n!0\n.15\n\n!0.15\n\n!0.1\n\n!0.1\n\n!0.15\n\n!0.35\n!0.35!0.35\n\n!0.15\n\n!0.05\n\nSSS (fut!pres) 41!43\no\n\nN\n\nlon (\no\n\n)\n\n!9.9 !9.8 !9.7 !9.6 !9.5 !9.4 !9.3 !9.2 !9.1 !9 !8.9\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nb)\n\nd)\n\nf)\n\nFigure 6.10: Monthly mean plots of SST (oC) and SSS future minus present differences\nas a function of longitude for three latitudinal bands: (a,b) 41-43oN; (c,d) 39-41oN; (e,f)\n37-39oN.\n\n158\n\n\n\n(the present ensemble UI is lower than COADS for those months), whereas in the other\npoints present ensemble overestimates UI in relation to COADS.\n\nThe reason for these changes is evident in the wind stress seasonal maps (Figure 6.2).\nRegarding the WIM, in winter and autumn the ensemble, both present and future, show\nsimilar patterns: southwesterly wind stress north of 39oN and westerly wind stress south\nof 39oN.

Due to the coarse resolution\nof global climate models, selecting the best model or method with respect to forcing is\ndifficult and debatable. Based on the sensitivity study of chapter 5, the ensemble mean of\na set of CGCMs was selected as the most adequate, because not only did it compare best\nwith climatological values, but also does it minimize individual uncertainties of the global\nmodels, in spite of the loss of horizontal resolution relative to some of the CGCMs.\n\nIn agreement with the general tendencies of future climate scenarios, and in particular in\nwhat concerns A2, the ocean off the WIM under increased greenhouse gas concentration is\nfound to warm as expected (e.g. Casey and Cornillon, 2001). Likewise, given the tendency\nfor the polar icecaps to melt or at least to become absent during the warm seasons, a\nfreshwater input is associated to future climate, and consequently a general decrease in the\nsalinity field (Gregory et al., 2005; Stouffer et al., 2006). However, in the coastal ocean,\nmore regional phenomena are at play and future assessments become more difficult.\n\nSea surface temperature and salinity change differently, depending on season, latitude\nand distance to the coast. In winter, SST changes are higher at more coastal locations\nthan in the open ocean, especially in southwestern WIM, in agreement with the tendency\nobserved by Relvas et al. (2009). Conversely, SSS changes are lower onshore than offshore.\n\nIn summer, offshore waters undergo a stronger increase in temperature than coastal\nwaters, including the regions associated with filament generation (Cape Finisterre and\nthe Estremadura Promontory). Again, the southwestern coast is the onshore region with\nthe highest temperature increase. On the other hand, SSS maintains its winter tendency:\nit presents the lowest decrease alongshore, especially around Galicia and northern WIM.\nThat is, SST differences tend to be higher to the south and SSS differences higher to the\nnorth. Furthermore, nearshore, SST and SSS differences are lower during the upwelling\nseason than in the remaining months.\n\nConcerning specifically the phenomenon of upwelling, there are two factors that need\nto be considered when evaluating climate change impacts on these systems: the change in\nwind stress and the change in the offshore-onshore SST gradient. First of all, they are not\nindependent from one another. Second, for a reliable assessment of wind stress change we\nwould need reliable future prediction of pressure systems, which have still much uncertainty\nas far as numerical models are concerned (e.g. Seidel et al., 2008).\n\nThere are two possible consequences of climate change, particularly the surface air\nwarming, on eastern boundaries:\n\n1) The summer over-land thermal low intensifies as a consequence of the more rapid\ntemperature increase over land than over ocean; hence, equatorward winds also intensify,\nas well as upwelling (Bakun, 1990);\n\n2) The general warming of the ocean increases the offshore-onshore SST gradient, typ-\nical of upwelling, thus weakening the upwelling itself.\n\nDi Lorenzo et al. (2005) found in observations of the California Current System, for pe-\nriod 1949-2000, that although upwelling-favorable winds had intensified in average during\n\n160\n\n\n\nsummer, a general warming had also taken place in the upper 200 m. This warming, in con-\njunction with the redistribution of heat carried out by the southward currents, brings about\na deepening of the thermocline and a stronger stratification. This increase in stratification\nreduces the vertical transport associated with upwelling and counteracts the strengthened\nupwelling-favorable winds, with the result of upwelling intensity and frequency decrease.\nSo, in fact, the two factors are at play, but one prevails over the other.\n\nThis might be the case of our modeling results: while a general increase in equatorward\nwind stress is predicted, it is also true that, although upwelling does not undergo weak-\nening, it undergoes narrowing and shallowing of its jet, most likely due to the increase in\nstratification.\n\nFurthermore, this two-factor dynamics is possibly why observations seem contradictory,\nat least for the Iberian Upwelling System, as previously mentioned. There seems to be\nconcordance in what concerns a general warming trend in the past decades (e.g. Ruiz-\nVillarreal et al., 2008), regardless if upwelling intensity is increasing or decreasing. However,\nit is not possible to draw definite conclusions on whether this warming is the cause for the\nweakening of upwelling through the increase in stratification.\n\nMoreover, there are also contradictory observations concerning wind stress in the past\ndecades, with some works reporting intensification of upwelling-favorable wind stress (Nara-\nyan et al., 2010), which is in agreement with our results, others reporting the opposite,\nespecially in the northwestern coast of the Iberian Peninsula (e.g. Ruiz-Villarreal et al.,\n2008), and others yet finding no change in wind stress whatsoever (Barton et al., 2013).\n\nIn this case, although we register an increase in UI, our modeling study seems to agree\nwith the view in which the warming of coastal waters inhibits vertical transport, thus\nleading to a narrowing of the upwelling jet. However, given the coarse resolution of the\nensemble forcing and associated uncertainties, we cannot ascertain which of the factors\nprevail over the other.\n\nPrevious similar modeling studies on the different upwelling systems reveal intensified\nalongshore equatorward winds (Snyder et al., 2003 for the California system; Garreaud\nand Falvey, 2009 for the Chilean coast; Miranda et al., 2012 for the Iberian system). These\nstudies conclude, from this increase, that it is very likely that upwelling will also increase\nin intensity and frequency. In spite of this, our in-depth results indicate that it may\nnot be as direct as the latter authors postulate; as previously discussed, the warming of\ncoastal waters and consequent increment in stratification may in fact cause net weakening\nof upwelling.\n\nGlobal climate models still have much uncertainty. In this study we have tried to put\nto use these state-of-the-art tools, along with a high-resolution ocean model configuration,\nand build a consistent evaluation study of a future scenario applied to an upwelling sys-\ntem. However, there are clear handicaps of CGCMs in reproducing the dynamics of these\nsystems, and in particular the Iberian Upwelling System. The most striking evidence of\nthis is the continuous upwelling signal along the Strait of Gibraltar reproduced by both\nensemble-forced runs, as if there were no geographic interruption. This is due to CGCM\nlow resolution, which also inhibits a more thorough analysis of, for instances, the wind\nstress fields and wind stress curl, crucial in dictating upwelling variability.\n\n161\n\n\n\n162\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nConclusions\n\nThe purpose of this work was to develop a study of the Western Iberian Margin upper\nocean hydrography and dynamics, and to carry out not only a seasonal characterization\nbut also an interannual variability analysis, and to explore what the future could hold.\n\nThe basis for this study was a regional model configuration that consisted on a two-\ndomain nesting, designed such that the larger domain would resolve the large-scale flow\nand properly introduce water masses and fluxes into the smaller, high-resolution domain\nthrough the boundaries. The high-resolution domain would then be able to reproduce,\nat once, the circulation at the shelf and at the slope, and the MW spreading, taking\ninto account the open ocean circulation and the strong bathymetric irregularities. This\nconfiguration, along with a proper advection scheme that allows to avoid diapycnal mixing\nerrors associated with ?-coordinate models, was found suitable to achieve the proposed\nobjectives, and allowed to study the WIM mean circulation (chapter 2), its interannual\nvariability (chapter 3), larvae connectivity patterns (chapter 4), and finally possible future\nimplications in the context of a climate change scenario (chapter 6), as well as the sensitivity\nof global climate models in forcing such a scenario (chapter 5).\n\nFrom chapter 2 it became clear that the WIM is characterized by a complex oceanic\nsystem, with both strong interannual variability and marked seasonal cycles. The mean\ncirculation results from the interaction of three main phenomena: coastal upwelling, the\nIberian Poleward Current and Mediterranean Water outflow through the Strait of Gibral-\ntar. The region dynamics is also influenced by large-scale phenomena such as the eastward\nextension of the Azores Current, the structure of the meridional density gradients, or the\nless energetic offshore, equatorward Portugal Current. Furthermore, small-scale localized\nphenomena such as the exchange of waters through the Strait of Gibraltar, which spreads\nthroughout the Eastern North Atlantic, or river inflow, particularly at the surface lay-\ners and along the continental shelf, also play a role in the system\u2019s dynamics. The most\nimportant results drawn from this chapter are the following:\n\n\u2022 The WIM mean circulation presents a tendency for poleward flow along the slope of\nthe WIM, although with some evidences of equatorward flow mostly in spring;\n\n\u2022 Wind-forced upwelling-driven equatorward flow is observed along the continental\n\n163\n\n\n\nshelf in summer, in coexistence with poleward flow offshore;\n\n\u2022 The main paths of poleward flow appear to be linked to the MW vein along the WIM\n(barotropic character);\n\nFurthermore, a Lagrangian application was carried out over this climatological run with\nthe purpose of assessing the origin of the waters that upwell along the WIM during summer.\nThe experimental set was a back-in-time deployment of Lagrangian particles, that is, the\npoints of departure were four bands along the WIM at the ocean subsurface (upwelling\nregion) and particles travelled back 30 days to see where they had originated from. Here\nare some remarks in what concerns the origin of upwelled waters along the WIM:\n\n\u2022 There is a higher number of upwelling particles coming from the north and from the\nupper 100 m (the main pathway of the upwelling equatorward jet);\n\n\u2022 The shallower they upwell, the shallower their origin is;\n\n\u2022 The particles that travel the longest distances originate at the shallowest depths, and\nvice-versa;\n\n\u2022 The particles that come from the deepest levels trace trajectories the closest to the\ncoast;\n\n\u2022 The particles that have origins the farthest away from their upwelling spots (and\nhence the shallowest origins and trajectories closest to the coast) seem more depen-\ndent on the equatorward jet, while particles that originate closer to the coast (and\nhence at deeper levels and from offshore) seem modulated by mesoscale activity.\n\nWith chapter 3, the intention was to broaden the climatological view of chapter 2 and\nextend it to an interannual study of the WIM dynamics. First, a description of a 45-year\nlong (1967-2011) upwelling index dataset was carried out, in an attempt to characterize\nthe mean wind conditions and their variability. Then, using an 11-year (2001-2011) ROMS\nsimulation, an analysis of anomalous years was attempted, based on SST, wind stress, and\nsalinity and surface velocity profiles. First of all, ROMS was able to reproduce reasonably\nwell the SST anomalies for the entire study period, as well as temperature and salinity\nprofiles given by Argo floats and surface currents for the one year and a half period available\nin observations. Secondly, a characterization of particular events of high/low salinities\nand/or strong alongshore velocities was carried out. We successfully identified episodes of\nS-N saline water advection, and found evidence of the poleward flow offshore shift during\nsummer, in the presence of upwelling. Furthermore, many of these modeled events have\ncorrespondence with observational studies in the literature.\n\nMaking use of this interannual study, chapter 4 was a Lagrangian application over the\nsame ROMS run for period 2001-2011 with realistic forcing, in order to compute some\ngeneric larvae connectivity aspects of SD. Two simulations were carried out: one with diel\nvertical motion (DVM), and one without. In doing so, the purpose was to check the role of\n\n164\n\n\n\nthis diurnal/nocturnal migration of larvae in the supply and recruitment along the WIM,\nin equally-spaced adjacent regions with equal areas. These were the main conclusions\nreached:\n\n\u2022 Wind stress direction plays an important role: in the occurrence of poleward events,\nthe direction of supply is mainly to the north, whereas when equatorward wind\nprevails supply is carried out in both directions;\n\n\u2022 The Estremadura Promontory works as a geographical gap between northern and\nsouthern WIM, consisting in a natural obstacle for supply from the south.\n\n\u2022 Supply is strongly influenced by topography: in the presence of pronounced features\nsuch as capes, promontories and general uneven coastline, retention is higher, whereas\nin regions where the coastline is roughly linear it is where the most successful sources\nare located;\n\n\u2022 In the simulation with DVM, retention increases throughout the domain (dispersal\ndistances are greater) and supply to the south increases significantly, due to the lesser\noffshore advection once the particles are not subject to Ekman transport.\n\nHaving in mind an ocean modeling essay applied to a future climate scenario, chapter 5\ncomprised an evaluation of several global climate models (GCM) as forcing for ROMS for\npresent conditions. The chapter was divided in two parts: the first consisted in a GCM\ninter-comparison regarding all variables needed to force ROMS, where difference fields were\nanalyzed, as well as seasonal averages and RMSEs; in the second part, two of these GCMs\nserved as forcing for two ROMS runs aiming at a sensitivity assessment. The ultimate goal\nwas to find the most suitable GCM to reproduce the present climatological atmospheric\nand ocean conditions at the surface. No GCM was found to be perfect in what concerns\nevery variable; they all had strengths and weaknesses. The main conclusion was that the\nmulti-model ensemble mean (GCM climatological average) would be the most appropriate\nforcing among the GCM dataset.\n\nAfter this assessment on the uncertainties of global climate models in reproducing the\npresent hydrography and dynamics of the WIM, and based on that conclusion, in chapter 6\nSD was forced with a future climatology. Besides the general warming of the ocean surface\nand subsurface (although varying in longitude and latitude) due to the increase in the\nsurface air temperature, expected by every future climate scenario, a general decrease in\nsalinity brought about by melting of ice in the poles was also found. Furthermore, although\nglobal climate models typically expect, for eastern boundary systems, strengthening of the\nalongshore equatorward winds and hence upwelling, the results do not show such a clear\noutcome. Indeed, as a consequence of a higher warming rate of the ocean temperature\noffshore than onshore, the SST cross-shore gradient intensifies, strengthening stratifica-\ntion, which inhibits vertical motion. As a result, the upwelling-associated equatorward jet\nintensifies, but the upwelling coastal band of colder and fresher waters is more restricted\nin width and depth, suggesting that both mechanisms are at play. The following main\nconclusions were drawn from this study:\n\n165\n\n\n\n\u2022 There is a general temperature increase and salinity decrease, particularly in the\nupper 100-200 m;\n\n\u2022 Winter: SST increase is higher onshore and SSS decrease is higher offshore;\n\n\u2022 Summer: SST increase is higher offshore and SSS decrease is higher offshore;\n\n\u2022 There is strengthening of the SST offshore-onshore gradient, and thus of stratification;\n\n\u2022 In spite of meridional wind stress intensification in summer, there is narrowing and\nshallowing of the upwelling jet, although at the surface there may be an equatorward\nvelocity increase.\n\nThese high-resolution ROMS configurations, which have also been successfully imple-\nmented in operational mode (http://climetua.fis.ua.pt/fields/oceanoAtlantic/templ1) and\nin biogeochemical studies (Reboreda et al., submitted, in review), enabled a study en-\ncompassing seasonality, mean behavior, interannual variability, future changes, and larval\ndispersion considerations. Overall, I believe this work constitutes a relevant contribution in\nthe understanding of the Iberian Upwelling System, addressing important physical aspects\nof the coastal transition zone.\n\n166\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\nAlbert, A., Echevin, V., Le?vy, M., and Aumont, O., 2010.
