VI!\n\nResumo \n\n \n\nA sedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o excessiva constituiu actualmente um dos maiores \n\nproblemas para a integridade ecol\u00f3gica dos cursos de \u00e1gua. No entanto, ainda \n\npouco se sabe sobre os efeitos deste problema no biota e processos chave \n\npara o funcionamento dos ecossistemas ribeirinhos, como a decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nfolhada. Neste trabalho pretendemos avaliar o efeito dos sedimentos finos (&lt;2 \n\nmm) no processamento de folhas de carvalho por fungos (Hifomicetes \n\nAqu\u00e1ticos) e invertebrados. Para isso foi avaliado em laborat\u00f3rio o efeito da \n\nvelocidade de transporte e granulometria de sedimentos (&lt;0,063 mm e &lt;2 \n\nmm) na perda de massa da folhada e par\u00e2metros microbianos associados. \n\nVerificou-se que as duas velocidades de desloca\u00e7\u00e3o de sedimentos simuladas \n\n(60 e 120 rpm) n\u00e3o afectaram a perda de massa, a dureza da folha ou a taxa \n\nde esporula\u00e7\u00e3o f\u00fangica, independentemente da presen\u00e7a ou n\u00e3o de \n\nsedimentos. Sedimentos de granulometria mista &lt;2 mm estimulam as taxas de \n\ndecomposi\u00e7\u00e3o da folhada por abras\u00e3o, enquanto que sedimentos de di\u00e2metro \n\n&lt;0,063 mm parecem induzir hip\u00f3xia no substrato inibindo o crescimento da \n\nbiomassa f\u00fangica e a decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o; neste caso, ocorre um maior investimento \n\nna reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o. O efeito dos sedimentos depositados (&lt;2 mm), e o efeito dos \n\nsedimentos em suspens\u00e3o (&lt;0,063 mm) na performance dos invertebrados \n\nforam avaliados atrav\u00e9s de testes de consumo com o insecto triturador \n\nSericostoma vittatum. Os resultados indicam que a deposi\u00e7\u00e3o dos sedimentos \n\nlimitam o consumo foliar uma vez que os invertebrados n\u00e3o s\u00e3o capazes de \n\nencontrar alimento enterrado a profundidades ? 1,5 cm; sedimentos &lt;0,063 \n\nmm em suspens\u00e3o (105 &lt;TDS &lt;110) n\u00e3o afectam as suas taxas de consumo. \n\n\n\n! VII!\n\nOs testes realizados sugerem que os efeitos dos sedimentos dependem da sua \n\ndeposi\u00e7\u00e3o ou suspens\u00e3o, granulometria e heterogeneidade, afectando de \n\nforma espec\u00edfica decompositores e detrit\u00edvoros e, portanto, a reciclagem de \n\nnutrientes e fluxo de energia do ecossistema ribeirinho. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o, comportamento alimentar, fragmenta\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nf\u00edsica, velocidade da corrente. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n! VIII!\n\nAbstract \n\n \n\nNowadays, the increased sedimentation due to anthropogenic activities \n\nis one of the biggest threats to the ecological integrity of watercourses. \n\nHowever, there are few studies about the impact of sediments on biota and on \n\nkey processes for stream functioning, such as leaf decomposition. In this work \n\nwe aimed to evaluate the effect of fine sediments (&lt;2 mm) on the breakdown \n\nprocess of oak leaves by fungi (Aquatic Hyphomycetes) and invertebrates. \n\nTherefore, the effect of transport velocity and sediment granulometry (&lt;2 mm \n\nand &lt;0.063 mm) on the loss of leaf mass and microbial parameters associated \n\nwere assessed. The two transport velocities chosen (60 and 120 rpm) did not \n\naffect mass loss, leaf toughness or sporulation rate, regardless the presence or \n\nabsence of sediments. Real mixture sediments (&lt;2 mm) stimulate breakdown \n\nrates due to physical abrasion. On the other and, sediments smaller than 0.063 \n\nmm seem to induce hypoxia conditions, inhibiting fungi biomass and \n\ndecomposition; in this case fungi invest more on reproduction while reducing its \n\nbiomass. The effect of deposited sediments (&lt;2 mm) and the effect of \n\nsediments in suspension (&lt;0.063 mm) in the performance of invertebrates \n\nwere assessed through leaf consumption tests by the shredder Sericostoma \n\nvittatum. The results show that sediments may limit the consumption of leaves \n\nsince the shredders are not able to feed on leaves buried at ? 1.5 cm; \n\nsediments &lt;0.063 mm on the water column (105 &lt;TDS &lt;110) does not affect \n\nconsumption rates. The experiments done suggest that the effect of sediments \n\nmay depend on their deposition or suspension, granulometry and \n\n\n\n! IX!\n\nheterogeneity, affecting decomposers and detritivores in a specific way, and \n\ntherefore, nutrients recycling and energy flux of the stream ecosystem. \n\n \n\nKey words: Sediments; Decomposition; Feeding behaviour; Physical \n\nfragmentation; current velocity. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n!

GENERAL INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nFreshwater systems are essential natural resources for life (V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty \n\net al., 2010). Despite constituting only about 0.01% of the world\u2019s water these \n\nsystems directly support 6% of all described species (Malmqvist &amp; Rundle, \n\n2002). Freshwaters are among the most endangered ecosystems, being \n\nthreatened by anthropogenic activities such as urbanization, industrialization, \n\nwater pollution, flow modification, destruction or degradation of habitat and \n\ninvasion by exotic species (Dudgeon et al., 2005). Furthermore, water \n\nresources are not evenly distributed, being barely accessible in some areas \n\n(Dewson et al., 2007). \n\nRunning waters are linked to and dependent on the surrounding \n\ncatchment areas, establishing strong and specific relationships with the \n\nadjacent terrestrial areas (Hynes, 1975). Streams in particular are being \n\naffected by the interaction of multiple factors including land use modification \n\n(Meyer &amp; Wallace, 2001), deforestation (Naymik &amp; Pan, 2005), and variations in \n\nthe stream geomorphology and hydrology. In fact, recent data indicate that \n\nhuman activities may increase the rates of sedimentation of up to 10 times the \n\nnatural inputs (Leigh &amp; Webb, 2006). \n\n \n\n1.1. Low order streams \n\nHeadwater streams, located at the beginning of the river continuum \n\n(Vannote et al., 1980) may constitute up to 85% of the total length of fluvial \n\nnetwork (Allan &amp; Castillo, 2007). Headwaters are low order streams (1-3 order; \n\nVannote et al., 1980), usually shaded by riparian vegetation with a low \n\n\n\n! 3!\n\nautotrophic production. Even though primary producers (e.g. algae) can be \n\nfound attached to submerged surfaces (periphyton) like stones and wood \n\nstocks in areas where light conditions are appropriate, this autochthonous \n\nsource of organic matter does not play a fundamental role in the energy flow of \n\nshaded headwaters (Allan &amp; Castillo, 2007). \n\nIn temperate low order streams, the energy source is strongly dependent \n\non the deciduous riparian vegetation - allochthonous inputs of organic matter - \n\nmainly composed by leaf litter (Molinero &amp; Pozo, 2004) but also by floral \n\nfragments, bark, wood and fruits (Benfield, 1997). This material may vary in \n\nquality and quantity, depending on the composition of the riparian vegetation, \n\nand is usually supplied to the stream with a marked seasonality. The higher \n\nlitter input occurs during autumn/winter (Abelho &amp; Graca, 1996), and this leaf \n\nmaterial is the main support of the aquatic food webs based on detritus for the \n\nfollowing months until next fall (Sponseller &amp; Benfield, 2001). Thus, some \n\ninvertebrates have synchronized their life cycles with the litter inputs (Vannote \n\net al., 1980; Cummins et al., 1989). \n\nThe conversion of these leaves into living biomass, i.e., leaves \n\nprocessing, is largely promoted by the activities of decomposers (mainly fungi - \n\nAquatic Hyphomycetes - and bacteria) and detritivores (mainly shredders; \n\nGessner et al., 1999). Detritus decomposition constitutes a key-ecosystem level \n\nprocess in these ecosystems (Ferreira et al., 2013). This process is primarily \n\ndetermined by the chemical and physical characteristics of the leaves (Abelho, \n\n2001) and is modulated by environmental factors (Young et al., 2008). For \n\nexample, soft nutritious leaves as alder are known to decompose faster than \n\nthe tough oak leaves rich in lignin, cellulose and phenolic compounds (Cortez et \n\n\n\n! 4!\n\nal., 1996). It is also generally accepted that in warmer or nutrient enriched \n\nwaters leaves decompose faster (Webster &amp; Benfield, 1986; Men\u00e9ndez et al., \n\n2003); on the other hand, low pH usually means a slower breakdown (Young et \n\nal., 2008; Riipinen et al., 2009). Other factors such as the stream hydrological \n\nregime, water velocity (Dewson et al., 2007) and type of sediment of the stream \n\n(Chauvet, 1997), may also influence leaves degradation (Young et al., 2008). \n\n \n\n1.2. Leaf litter breakdown in streams \n\nLeaf decomposition starts upon leaves immersion and usually follows \n\nthree main steps: leaching, conditioning and fragmentation. These steps may \n\noverlap, although a more or less defined sequence is usually observed \n\n(Gessner et al., 1999). \n\nLeaching is a fast abiotic process that usually lasts for 48 h. During this \n\nprocess, soluble organic and inorganic compounds are released from leaves to \n\nthe water (Abelho, 2001; Allan &amp; Castillo, 2007), and up to 42% of leaf weigh \n\nmay be lost (reviewed by Abelho, 2001). The quality and quantity of the \n\nleachates are determined a priori by chemical and structural differences of the \n\nleaf species (Campbell et al., 1992) and can be influenced by several abiotic \n\nfactors such as pH, water temperature and turbulence (Abelho, 2001). \n\nConditioning is mainly performed by fungi (namely Aquatic \n\nHyphomycetes) and also by bacteria. This prokaryotic group is usually more \n\nimportant in advanced stages of leaves decomposition. Aquatic hyphomycetes \n\nare usually dominant in the first phase of the colonization process and are the \n\nmain responsibles for the increase in palatability and nutritional value of detritus \n\n\n\n! 5!\n\nto invertebrates (Gessner, 1999); this change in the detritus characteristics is \n\nknown as conditioning. \n\nChanges in leaves nutritional value include increases in Nitrogen and \n\nPhosphorous, softening, degradation of recalcitrant Carbon and enrichment \n\nwith fungal enzymes (Canhoto &amp; Gra\u00e7a, 2008). Fungal spores settlement \n\n(Kearns &amp; B\u00e4rlocher, 2008), fungal biomass and sporulation also depend on \n\nleaves physic-chemical characteristics and is also modulated by environmental \n\nfactors such as flow and water chemistry (Abelho, 2001). The flow allows \n\ngreater turbulence and oxygenation of water, better for fungi colonization \n\n(Chauvet, 1992). According to Ferreira et al. (2006), the current velocity is able \n\nto control the fungal parameters, stimulating the spore release and the conidial \n\nproduction, being the presence of fungal species higher. \n\nThe last phase of decomposition is usually designated as fragmentation. \n\nIt can be promoted by physical abrasion and/or invertebrates, during their \n\nfeeding or \u201carchitectural\u201d activities to build their cases (Abelho, 2001). \n\nInvertebrates activities are known to accelerate the fragmentation process \n\n(Gra\u00e7a et al., 2001). There are many studies that indicate invertebrates as \n\nactive subjects on fragmentation (Gessner &amp; Chauvet, 1997; Abelho, 2001; \n\nFerreira &amp; Gra\u00e7a, 2006). \n\nShredders usually make a great contribution to the Fine Particulate \n\nOrganic Matter (FPOM) content in streams (Covich et al., 1999) by breaking \n\nleaves into smaller fragments, increasing in that way the area available for \n\nmicrobial activity and providing extra food for collectors downstream; 60% of the \n\ningested material is converted into faeces (Cummins et al., 1989). Shredders, \n\nimportant ecological engineers in the stream (Moore, 2006), are fundamental \n\n\n\n! 6!\n\nfor the lotic system as they process fluxes of matter downstream, playing an \n\nimportant role on the river continuum concept (Vannote et al., 1980). Shredders \n\nprefer to feed on leaves colonized (Gra\u00e7a, 2001), since fungi change chemically \n\nand physically the quality of leaves (Canhoto &amp; Gra\u00e7a, 2008), and might also \n\nprefer particular fungi (Lecerf et al., 2005) or even different combination of \n\nleaf/fungi species, which may provide specific and/or distinct and fundamental \n\nnutrients and carbohydrates to the consumers (Barlocher et al., 2003). On the \n\nother hand, fungi can also have preference for different leaves (Canhoto &amp; \n\nGra\u00e7a, 2008). \n\n \n\nIt is generally recognized that leaves physical abrasion promotes \n\nfragmentation (Chauvet et al., 1993); however, the relative importance of this \n\npromoter of abiotic degradation is still unknown (Heard et al., 1999). \n\nLeaves physical fragmentation on streams is ruled by leaves \n\ncharacteristics and is dependent on environmental factors such as current \n\nvelocity, substratum and quantity and quality of the sediment in transport \n\n(Chauvet et al., 1993). The loss of leaves integrity is facilitated by the \n\nconditioning process and is usually slower when leaves are in pools rather than \n\nin riffle areas (Casas, 1996). As stated by several authors (Benfield et al., 2001; \n\nLepori et al., 2005) higher flows, especially during floods, increase the amount \n\nof suspended sediments, and consequently the physical abrasion of leaves. \n\nHowever, the opposition was also found: Matthaei et al. (2010) found an \n\nincrease in decay rate at reduced stream flows, which can be explained by the \n\nretention of sediments resulting from flow reduction. In fact, when leaves are \n\n\n\n! 7!\n\nsubmitted to coarse sediment, a higher breakdown rate is usually observed, \n\nwhen comparing to fine sediment (Young et al., 2008). \n\n \n\n1.3. Sediments and sedimentation \n\n1.3.1. Types of sediments \n\nSediments can be characterized according to their shape, size, \n\nmineralogy, colour, and orientation (Gordon et al., 2004). The type of sediments \n\nusually depends on the origin of the input: hill slopes, abrasion and/or sorting \n\n(Allan &amp; Castillo, 2007), and their deposition will be influenced by their shape, \n\nsize, density and fall velocity (Bethwell &amp; Mutz, 2005). Nevertheless, the \n\nimpacts of sediments on ecosystem will depend on the characteristics of the \n\nstream (e.g. topography and soil type), surrounding areas, and the volume of \n\nsediments transported (Wood &amp; Armitage, 1997). \n\nSediment loads can be determined by the amount of sediments \n\ntransported in a point during a specific time interval, multiplied by the water \n\ndischarge (Allan &amp; Castillo, 2007). The expression \u201cfine sediment\u201d usually \n\ndefines elements smaller than 2 mm, including clay, silt and sand (Wood &amp; \n\nArmitage, 1997). However, not all authors use the same designation, some \n\nconsidering particles smaller than 250 \u00b5m to be fine sediment (Kreutzweiser et \n\nal., 2005). \n\nAccording to Gordon et al. (2004), there are three major groups of \n\nsediment loads: flotation load, dissolved load (particles carried in the solution) \n\nand sediment load. This last group is divided into two categories: washload, (&lt;\n\n0.063 mm), and bed-material load that can be suspended load or bedload. \n\n\n\n! 8!\n\nDivision in these categories is difficult though, because they change \n\nsubstantially depending on water flow (Fig. 1). \n\n \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Representation of the different sediment loads of the \n\nstream according to Gordon et al. (2004). \n\n \n\nThe transport of sediments is a natural feature of streams. Transportation \n\nand distance are directly related with the flow, since higher flows transport \n\nsediments further. Usually, all sediments derive from erosion of the basin slope, \n\nbut urban streams have a different sediments supply, since it depends on urban \n\ninfrastructure, usually presenting bed erosion, with different consequences \n\n(Allan &amp; Castillo, 2007). Fine sediments can be transported either by rolling, \n\nsliding or salting (Wood &amp; Armitage, 1997), or on the water column when flow is \n\nsufficient (Petts et al., 1985; Fig. 2). \n\n\n\n! 9!\n\n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Categories of sediments transportation in a stream by \n\nPetts et al., 1985. \n\n \n\n1.3.2. Excessive sedimentation in watercourses: a worldwide problem \n\nSediments are a natural component of streams. However, the amount of \n\nsediments produced and transported are presently excessive due to human \n\nactivities (Schofield et al., 2004), and sedimentation is threatening the aquatic \n\nfauna (Richter et al., 1997). The concept of sedimentation includes \u201cthe process \n\nwhereby substrata are covered and interstitial spaces of the substrata are filled \n\nby deposited sediment\u201d (Henley et al., 2000). This process may change the \n\nsubstrate through changes in superficial surface (Graham, 1990) and depends \n\non the flow (Wood &amp; Armitage, 1997). Usually, sedimentation is higher when \n\nthe flow is low, since it allows the suspended sediments to settle (Wood &amp; \n\nArmitage, 1997). However, according to Bond (2004), sedimentation can be \n\nlower when the flow is reduced, since the quantity of suspended sediments \n\ntransported also decreases. \n\n\n\n! 10!\n\nExcessive sedimentation is a worldwide problem frequently associated \n\nwith anthropogenic activities. Such activities include excavation of river sand, \n\nforest clearance (Broekhuizen et al., 2001; Larsen &amp; Ormerod, 2010), \n\nmodification of riparian vegetation and changes within the drainage basin such \n\nas agricultural activites (Townsend et al., 2008; Larsen &amp; Ormerod, 2010), \n\nindustrialization (Broekhuizen et al., 2001), construction of road structures \n\n(Extence, 1978), and/or mining (Broekhuizen et al., 2001). All these activities \n\nare known to change the dynamic of sediment transportation and settlement \n\n(Waters, 1995). \n\nSedimentation is presently considered one of the main threats to the \n\necological integrity of streams and rivers (Young et al., 2008; Benoy et al., \n\n2012) with important consequences on the fluvial continuum. On one hand, big \n\namounts of sediment transported can lead to problems in the estuarine areas \n\nand reefs, whereas a lack of sediment transported downstream can lead to a \n\nretreat in river deltas and coastal shorelines, causing losses of habitat and \n\nincreasing vulnerability to storms (Allan &amp; Castillo, 2007). On the other hand, \n\noverload sedimentation in potable waters requires filtration treatment, which can \n\nbe avoided by reforesting some species (Lake et al., 2000). \n\n \n\n1.3.3. Consequences of sedimentation for the biota \n\nSediments can be either carried by the flow, increasing turbidity, or \n\ndeposited on the bottom of the stream. An excess of sediments can affect the \n\nbiota (Larsen &amp; Ormerod, 2010). \n\nPrimary producers are affected by sedimentation (Quinn et al., 1992), \n\nwith macrophyte leaves and stems directly affected by scouring and abrasion \n\n\n\n! 11!\n\n(Lewis, 1973). Thus, primary production can be reduced, especially in situations \n\nwhere light available is low (Wood &amp; Armitage, 1997), producing a bottom-up \n\neffect in food webs. The diversity of benthic invertebrates can be changed \n\nindirectly, since sediments can occupy interstitial habitats, reducing the \n\nabundance and/or quality of periphyton (food source for most invertebrates; \n\nBroekhuizen et al., 2001). \n\nSpecific substrate types may determine and shape invertebrate \n\ncommunities present in streams. For example Oligochaeta, Sphariidae \n\n(Armitage, 1995), and Chironomidae larvae can be benefited by the abundance \n\nof fine sediments as they use these particles to construct cases and tubes \n\n(Dudgeon, 1994). Trichoptera belonging to the Families Glossossomatidae, \n\nGoeridae and Sericostomatidae use small pebbles to build cases, which \n\nprovide shelter from predators (Schofield et al., 2004). But sediments can limit \n\nspecies survival (Jowett et al., 1991) by inhibiting, damaging or reducing their \n\nfilter feeding capacity (Aldridge et al., 1987) and respiration structures (Lemly, \n\n1982), leading to an increase in drift (Gibbins et al., 2004; Larsen &amp; Ormerod, \n\n2010). In fact, Suren &amp; Jowett (2001) demonstrated that drift may be related \n\nwith the size of sediments, with smaller sediments promoting higher rates of \n\ndrift. Sediment inputs can increase drift directly due to particles, or indirectly \n\nbecause sediments may reduce the quality of food resources (Graham, 1990). \n\nChanges in habitat conditions promoted by sediments may also affect the \n\ninvertebrates assemblages: Simuliidae larvae, for example, need clean rocks, \n\nnot covered by sediments, to attach their silks (Management biodiversity issues, \n\n2001). Habitats predominated by either fine or large sediments are poorer than \n\nmixture environments, suggesting that the heterogeneity of the substratum is \n\n\n\n! 12!\n\nusually related to high diversity of invertebrates, since sediment sizes can \n\ninfluence the bedload as well as its mobility (Gibbins et al., 2004). \n\nMussels for example can also be affected by fine sediments: bivalves \n\nfeed trough the filtration of water, so they are directly sensible to increases of \n\nsediments in the water column (Shin, et al., 2002). If females face limitation in \n\nfood resources, the amount of nutrients needed for egg production is insufficient \n\nand reproduction might be affected (Landis et al., 2013). Furthermore, since \n\nsediments are often associated with pollutants, bivalves can bioaccumulate the \n\npollutants present in the water (Shin, et al., 2002). \n\nSediment impacts on fish are well documented, due to their economic \n\nand recreational importance (Wood &amp; Armitage, 1997). The consequences of \n\nsediment loads on fish are vast: difficulty in swimming, decrease of growth rate, \n\nlower tolerance to diseases, and clogging of the gill filaments causing \n\nasphyxiation (Bruton, 1985), which can alter the usual migration patterns of fish \n\n(Alabaster &amp; Lloyd, 1982). They can also change the feeding behavior, since an \n\nincrease of suspended sediments can obstruct the filter feeding capacity \n\n(Aldridge et al., 1987). Also, fish species that are used to clean waters will be in \n\ndisadvantage, and predator-prey relation may be changed (Ran\u00e5ker et al., \n\n2012). Furthermore, deposited sediments can clog gravel-spawning grounds of \n\nseveral fish species affecting fish communities (Sear, 1993). \n\n \n\nIt is known that rivers suffer flow variability, from floods to low flows, and \n\nthis result in variations of the suspended solids concentrations, as well as on \n\ntheir deposition (Wood &amp; Armitage, 1997). Hence, benthic faunal communities \n\nis likely able to deal with these variations on sediment loads. Rapid increases of \n\n\n\n! 13!\n\nsediment loads may allow a rapid recovery. Nevertheless, constant sediments \n\ninput due to human activities can modify the natural fauna. Furthermore, the \n\ninput of sediments to streams is usually associated with nutrient enrichment as \n\na result of watershed logging (Benfield et al., 2001), chemicals input due to \n\nagriculture intensification (Liess et al., 1999) or even heavy metals and toxic \n\nsubstances pollution that can be aggregated to sediments (Gordon, 2004). \n\nInput of sediments into the streams is a natural process; it becomes a \n\nproblem when higher inputs due to human activities affect and threat all natural \n\ncycles of the ecosystem (Management biodiversity issues, 2001). \n\n \n\n1.4. Main objectives \n\nIn this study we assessed the effects of sediments, in transport or \n\ndeposited, in leaves decomposition promoted by fungi and invertebrates. For \n\nthat purpose, several experiments were carried out to assess the effect of water \n\nvelocity (with consequent distinct intensities of bed-material loads) and \n\nsediment granulometry on microbial mediated decomposition. Tests were also \n\nperformed in order to address invertebrates consumption in environments \n\nwhere their feeding behavior was challenged by high amounts of suspended \n\nbed-load or deposited sediment over the food items. \n\n\n\n! 14!\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n- Materials and Methods - \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n! 15!\n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\n2.1. General \n\nOak (Quercus robur L.) leaves were collected after senescence, air dried \n\nin the dark at ambient temperature and stored until needed. Initial phosphorus, \n\nnitrogen and total phenols were determined (Gra\u00e7a et al. 2005). Before using \n\nthe leaves, they were moistened with distilled water, in order to avoid breakage \n\nduring handling. Leaves were assembled in groups of ~2 g in fine mesh bags \n\n(10 \u00d7 15 cm, 0.5 mm mesh) to avoid decomposition by macroinvertebrates. A \n\ntotal of 13 bags were incubated, for 21 (December, winter) or 10 days (March, \n\nspring), in a second order stream located at Lous\u00e3 mountain, Central Portugal \n\n(Candal stream; 40\u00ba04\u201948.10\u2019\u2019N, 8\u00ba12\u201911.16\u2019\u2019W, 634 m a.s.l.). \n\nAfter the incubation periods, bags were brought to the laboratory in a \n\ncooler and were carefully rinsed with distilled water to remove attached \n\nsediments. Stream water samples were also transported to the laboratory, \n\nfiltered (fiberglass filter, Millipore APFF) and frozen at \u201318 \u00b0C for determination \n\nof cations and anions by ion chromatography (Dionex DX-120, Sunnyvale, \n\nCalifornia, USA) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration (Allan &amp; \n\nCastillo 2007). Stream substratum was collected and sieved in situ in order to \n\nobtain sediment &lt;2 mm. Hereafter this sediment will be referred as real mixture \n\n(RM). In the laboratory, sediment was ignited (550\u00baC; 4 h) to remove organic \n\nmatter; being separated in 2 size classes (&lt;0.063 mm and &lt;2 mm) using a \n\nsieve shaker (Fig. 3). \n\n \n\n\n\n! 16!\n\n \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Sieve shaker used to separate the sediment collected in \n\nCandal stream (&lt;2 mm) by size classes (&lt;2 mm and &lt;0.063 mm) \n\n \n\n2.2. Microbial-mediated decomposition tests \n\n2.2.1. Effects of sediment load velocity on leaves decomposition \n\nTen pairs of leaf discs were symmetrically obtained from the conditioned \n\nleaves, with a cork borer (\u00d8 = 12 mm). One disc of each pair was used to \n\nevaluate leaf toughness expressed as the required mass (g of water in a \n\ncontainer) to push a 1 mm diameter metal shaft through the leaf disc. These \n\ndiscs were then oven-dried (105\u00baC; 48 h) and weighed to evaluate initial dry \n\nmass (DMi). The correspondent pairs were immersed in 20 Erlenmeyers of 500 \n\nml with 10 discs each, previously filled with 200 ml of filtered (filter paper) \n\nstream water. \n\nA total of 20 Erlenmeyers (each one with a total of 10 discs obtained as \n\nabove) were divided into two horizontal shakers rotating at 60 or 120 rotations \n\n\n\n! 17!\n\nper minute (rpm) (Fig. 4). In each shaker, half the Erlenmeyers (n = 5) were \n\nprovided with 26 g of RM while the other half only contained stream water. \n\nIncubation lasted for 4 weeks, in an acclimatized room at 15 \u00b1 2\u00baC. At the end \n\nof the experiment, sets of 5 discs from each replicate were used to determine \n\nsporulation. For subsequent counting, all conidial suspensions were mixed with \n\n100 \u00b5l of Triton X \u2013 100 solution (0.5%), an aliquot was filtered (Millipore \n\nSMWP, 5 \u00b5m pore size) and the spores retained stained with 0.05% cotton blue \n\nin acid lactic (60%). Spores were counted under a compound microscope at \n\n250\u00d7 (Gra\u00e7a et al. 2005).  \n\nAll incubated leaf discs were oven dried (105\u00baC; 48h) and weighted. \n\nRemaining dry mass was evaluated as the difference between the initial and the \n\nfinal dry mass of the leaf circles in each microscosm. \n\n \n\n2.2.2. Effects of sediment size on leaf litter decomposition \n\nOak leaves conditioned in the stream for ten days (in Spring) were used \n\nto obtain pairs of leaf discs as above: half the discs were oven-dried (105\u00baC; \n\n48h) and weighted to determine initial dry mass. The correspondent pairs were \n\nequitatively distributed by Erlenmeyers, in groups of ten: groups of five \n\nErlenmeyers were provided with 26 g of RM, 26 g of extra fine sediment (\u00d8 &lt;\n\n0.063 mm; EFS treatment) or No sediment was added. After this period, as \n\nabove, sets of five discs from each microcosm were used to induce sporulation. \n\nFor counting and identification, all conidial suspensions were mixed with 100 \u00b5l \n\nof Triton X \u2013 100 solution (0.5%), an aliquot was filtered (Millipore SMWP, 5 \u00b5m \n\npore size) and the spores retained were stained with 0.05% cotton blue in acid \n\nlactic (60%). Spores were identified and counted under a compound \n\n\n\n! 18!\n\nmicroscope at 250\u00d7 (Gra\u00e7a et al. 2005). Sporulation rates were expressed as \n\nnumber of conidia/mg DM/day. \n\n \n\nThree out of the ten leaf discs from each microcosm were used to \n\nevaluate ergosterol content as a proxy of fungal biomass (Gessner &amp; Chauvet \n\n1993; Young, 1995).!Leaf discs from all replicates and treatments were freeze \n\ndried, lyophilized and weighted. Ergosterol extraction was performed according \n\nto Gessner et al. (2003): ergosterol concentration was quantified by high \n\nperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Merck LiChroCART 250-4 \n\n(LiChrospher 100) RP-18 column, by measuring absorbance at 282 nm (Young \n\n1995).!Ergosterol was converted into fungal biomass using a conversion factor \n\nof 5.5 \u00b5g ergosterol/mg fungal DM (Gessner &amp; Chauvet, 1993). Results were \n\nexpressed as mg fungal biomass/g DM. Dry Mass remaining (DMr) was \n\nevaluated and expressed as percentage of initial dry mass. \n\n \n\n2.3. Invertebrates feeding tests \n\nLarvae of Sericostoma vittatum Rambur (Trichoptera; Sericostomatidae) \n\nwere collected in a low-order stream of Central Portugal (Ribeira de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, \n\nLous\u00e3 mountain, Central Portugal; 40\u00ba05\u201959\u201dN, 8\u00ba14\u201902\u201dW) and transported to \n\nthe laboratory in cooled plastic boxes. In the laboratory, animals were kept in \n\nplastic containers filled with stream water with stream sediment in the bottom \n\n(15\u00baC; 12 h light: 12 h dark photoperiod). They were fed ad libitum with stream \n\nconditioned oak leaves. \n\nConsumption tests were run with individuals of medium size (8.8 mg \u00b1 \n\n3.3) evaluated using the diameter of their case opening; relationship between \n\n\n\n! 19!\n\nthe case opening and dry mass was achieved by the formula: DM = 0.0136 x \n\nCO \u2013 0.0162 (R2 = 0.83) where DM is dry mass (mg) and CO is case opening \n\n(mm) (Ferreira et al., 2010). \n\nIn all tests, measured individuals were starved for 24 h prior to the \n\nexperiments and then randomly allocated in the microcosms (5.5 cm diameter; \n\n15.5 cm height) provided with ignited (550\u00baC; 4 h) stream sediment (EFS or \n\nRM) at the bottom, and filled with 300 ml of filtered stream water (filter paper) \n\ncontinuously aerated. Experiments were stopped when half of the discs were \n\neaten in 50% of the microcosms. \n\n \n\n2.3.1. Effects of sediment in suspension on invertebrates consumption \n\nA total of 60 microcosms were provided with 3 g of sediment (&lt;0.063 \n\nmm). In half of the containers a longer oxygenation tube (Suspended sediments \n\ntreatment; SS) ensured a higher turbulence of the water, allowing the sediments \n\nto be continuously suspended in the water column instead of deposited in \n\nbottom (Control treatment; C). Three small stones were placed in each \n\ncontainer in order to provide the possibility of refuge from turbulence to the \n\ninvertebrates. At the beginning of the experiments, two symmetrical discs were \n\ncut from the conditioned oak leaves conditioned in the stream; leaf discs were \n\nobtained avoiding the central vein. Discs from each pair were assumed to have \n\nidentical initial mass. Each microscosm was provided with one oak disc placed \n\non the top of the sediments and another enclosed in a fine mesh bag (0.5 mm \n\nmesh size; 3 x 4 cm) attached with a clip to the top of the microscosm. This bag \n\nwas kept inside the water, but no contact was allowed between the leaf disc \n\nand the animal (control disc). The discs were stuck to the bottom of the cup with \n\n\n\n! 20!\n\npins to ensure food availability in spite of the turbulence. Oxygenation and total \n\ndissolved solids (TDS) were daily monitored. Samples of water were taken from \n\neach microscosm at three water depths (top, middle and bottom) in order to \n\ncheck for sediment suspension uniformity. In this case, 2 ml of water were \n\ncollected with a plastic pipette, placed into pre-weighed eppendorf tubes, \n\ncentrifuged and dried (60\u00baC; 48 hours). Eppendorf tubes were then re-weighted \n\nand sediment quantity trapped in the water column assessed as the difference \n\nbetween the eppendorfs weight. After 2 days, the experiment was stopped and \n\ndiscs were dried (60\u00b0 C; 48 h). Consumption in each microcosm was estimated \n\nas the difference between the control and the correspondent disc offered to the \n\nanimal. Consumption was expressed as mg leaf consumed/g animal/day. \n\n  \n\n2.3.2 Effects of sediment deposition on food consumption \n\nA total of 45 microcosms were provided with 90 g of ignited RM \n\noriginating a total sediment depth in the microcosm of 3 cm. Pre-measured S. \n\nvittatum larvae were randomly distributed by the microscosms and carefully \n\nplaced on the top of the sediment. For each microscosm, two symmetrical discs \n\nwere cut as above from the conditioned oak leaves avoiding the central vein; \n\none was used to feed the animal and the other placed inside a fine mesh bag \n\n(0.5 mm mesh size; 3 x 4 cm) in order to prevent invertebrate\u2019s consumption \u2013 \n\ncontrol disc. On the first treatment (n = 15) a single disc hold by a pin were \n\nplaced on the top of sediment (hereafter called Top); on second treatment \n\n(n=15) the leaf disc was placed in mid-depth of the sediment (~1.5 cm depth; \n\nhereafter called Middle) while the last fifteen replicates had the disc placed in \n\nthe bottom of the sediment (3 cm depth; hereafter called Bottom). The \n\n\n\n! 21!\n\nexperiment lasted for 6 days when 50% of the discs were half eaten by half the \n\ninvertebrates in one of the treatments. \n\n \n\n2.4. Data analysis \n\nLeaves mass loss and toughness promoted by sediment abrasion at two \n\nwater velocities, and sporulation rates observed in each treatment were \n\ncompared by 2-way analyses of variance (ANOVA). \n\nThe effect of sediment granulometry on leaf mass loss, fungal biomass \n\nsporulation rates and total number of aquatic hyphomycete species were \n\ncompared by 1-way ANOVA. Whenever necessary, a Tukey test was used. \n\nLeaf species specific fungal assemblages associated to all sediment treatment \n\nwere analyzed by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination, \n\nbased on Bray Curtis similarity index of log (x+1) transformed conidial \n\nabundance data (PRIMER v6; Clarke &amp; Gorley, 2001). An analysis of similarity \n\n(1-way ANOSIM) was also performed to test the similarity between treatments, \n\nwith sediment granulometry as factor. \n\nLeaves consumption by the invertebrates under distinct sediment \n\nsuspension intensity was compared by a t-test. Invertebrate consumption of \n\nleaves covered by sediment was compared among treatments by 1-way \n\nANOVA, followed by Tukey test whenever necessary. \n\nData were log (x+1) transformed when necessary to achieve the \n\nassumptions, normality and homogeneity of variances. All statistical analyses \n\nwere performed to a significance level of P = 0.05 and carried out using \n\nSTATISTICA v7 for Windows. \n\n \n\n\n\n! 22!\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n- Results - \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n! 23!\n\n3.

DISCUSSION \n\n \n\nThe number of studies on the importance of sediment loads or sediment \n\ndeposition on leaves decomposition and shredder ecology are still few \n\nconsidering the spatial dimension and relevance of this problem to streams \n\necological integrity (Cornut et al., 2010; Matthaei et al., 2010), and the results \n\ngathered are frequently contradictory. Furthermore, it is difficult to isolate the \n\nimpacts of sedimentation on the biota or stream processes, because \n\nsedimentation is most of the times associated to other factors like nutrient \n\nenrichment or canopy removal (Schofield et al., 2004). To avoid this problem, a \n\nlarge number of studies (e.g. Rosenberg &amp; Wiens, 1978; Sanpera-Calbet et al., \n\n2011) were performed in artificial streams or in laboratory (this one included); \n\nalthough such approaches are accurate and scientifically sound they make \n\ndifficult to assess biotic interactions (Schofield et al., 2004) and to extrapolate \n\nresults for real ecosystems. Nonetheless they certainly help to explain the \n\neffects of sedimentation observed in stream communities, in particular stream \n\nmacroinvertebrates (Piggott et al., 2012) and processes as leaf decomposition \n\n(Cornut et al., 2010; Danger et al., 2012). In this study the effects of sediment \n\nloads were assessed at two distinct levels: microbial-mediated decomposition \n\nand invertebrate-mediated decomposition of leaf litter, evaluating the effects of \n\nsediments on the main protagonists of leaves processing in heterotrophic \n\nsystems based on detritus - microbes (mainly Aquatic Hyphomycetes) and \n\nshredders - and their function. Results pointed to specific impacts at both basic \n\nlevels of the stream detrital-based food chains, which may suggest potential \n\nbottom-up consequences in the stream biota. \n\n\n\n! 38!\n\nBedload of fine sediments (simulated by microcosms shaking) did not \n\naffect leaves degradation promoted by fungi; a higher water velocity (120 rpm) \n\ndid not affect leaves mass loss, toughness or sporulation rates. This was \n\npartially surprising, as higher water velocities are known to stimulate sporulation \n\nrates and the number of conidia produced, independently of the colonization \n\nrate (Ferreira et al. 2006). Furthermore, the presence of sediments may \n\nincrease friction by rolling and sliding on the leaves surface potentially \n\nstimulating mycelial growth, which could determine an increase in the number \n\nof spores produced. Such effects did not seem to have occurred since mass \n\nloss or toughness decrease (also a proxy of leaves mass loss; Medeiros et al., \n\n2009) promoted by fungal activities did not differ between water velocities. The \n\npresent results are in agreement with Sanpera-Calbet et al. (2011). These \n\nauthors associated the lack of sediments effect with the initial colonization of \n\nthe leaves. Since all leaves were colonized with no sediments, the following \n\ncontact with this material made no difference (once fixed on the leaf substrate, \n\nspores germinate quickly and mycelia adhere to the leaves; Dang et al., 2007). \n\nOn the other hand, significant differences between treatments were expected \n\nsince higher water velocity, like the one observed in riffles, is known to promote \n\nhigher physical fragmentation in comparison with pools or dam zones, where \n\nthe flow is reduced and leaves decompose slowly (Casas, 1996; Young et al., \n\n2008). In fact, several studies argue in favour of significant effect of sediment \n\nloads on leaves decomposition (Benfield et al., 2001; Matthaei et al., 2010). It \n\nseems possible that the incubation period of the leaves in the stream was too \n\nlong (in spite of low winter temperatures) or that heavy precipitation during the \n\nconditioning period in the stream promoted an excessive degradation of the \n\n\n\n! 39!\n\nleaves used in the microcosms, masking the potential differences between \n\ntreatments. Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility that the amount of \n\nsediments added or even the water velocity was not sufficient to accelerate the \n\nprocess of breakdown by physical abrasion (Schofield et al., 2004). \n\n \n\nSediment granulometry affected leaves decomposition. A heterogeneous \n\nfine sediment (\u00d8 &lt;2 mm; RM) seem to maintain/stimulate leaves mass loss \n\nwhile the EFS sediment tend to depress leaves degradation. Although no \n\nsignificant differences could be observed in fungal biomass (p &lt;0.43) the \n\nconcentration of ergosterol evaluated in leaves incubated in microcosms with \n\nEFS showed about half the values of the leaves incubated in No sediment or \n\nRM microcosms, which suggests that such small particle sizes may depress \n\nfungal growth, and mass loss. Leaves in the microcosms could have been \n\nburied and protected from turbulence and collisions of the sediment during \n\nrotation. In this treatment, and in spite of the water movement (120 rpm), the \n\ncontact between the water and the leaves may be limited by an eventual \n\nsediment compaction inhibiting O2 access to the mycelium.\" Such decrease in \n\nfungal biomass may be in agreement with Kreutzweiser and co-workers (2005) \n\nresults that indicate that fine sediments can decrease the palatability to \n\nshredders due to a lower microbial activity. In opposition, a heterogeneous \n\nsubstratum as the one present in the real mixture may favor oxygenation that, \n\nalong with the sediments abrasion effect (in particular of the larger particles; \n\nHeard et al., 1999; Young et al., 2008), may facilitate leaves mycelial growth \n\nand breakdown. Although this could not be confirmed by our results, it seems \n\nclear that the smaller the particle size, the higher the sporulation rates and total \n\n\n\n! 40!\n\nnumber of fungal species in the media. A clear reproductive investment occurs \n\nin the presence of sediments, in particular of EFS. This was unexpected as the \n\npresence of sediments is usually associated with a decrease in number of \n\nspecies (Sanpera-Calbet et al., 2011) and not the opposite. Nonetheless, we \n\ncould detect a clear effect of the presence of sediments (both types) on fungal \n\nassemblages structure in relation to the media with no sediment. The higher \n\ncontribution was done by Tetrachaetum elegans (30%), followed by \n\nClavariopsis chaetocladium (27%).! Articulospora tetracladia is abundantly \n\npresent in all treatments (50% in no sediment; 22% in real mixture; 26% in \n\nEFS), showing that it is a specie well adapted for different sediment conditions \n\n(Medeiros et al., 2009; Cornut et al., 2010; Sanpera-Calbet et al., 2011). \n\nSurprisingly, T. elegans was found in all treatments and well represented; other \n\nstudies showed that this specie is usually very sensitive to sediments and \n\ninhibited in their presence (Cornut et al., 2010; Sanpera-Calbet et al., 2011). \n\nThese differences in the composition and structure of fungal assemblages \n\nbetween treatments indicate that different species present different answers to \n\nthe stress promoted by the sediments. It seems possible that the reduced O2 \n\nlevels nearby the leaves (particularly in EFS) might have reduced the mycelial \n\ngrowth of dominant species, reducing competition and allowing other species to \n\ngrow and sporulate. It is generally accepted that sporulation may occur in \n\nhypoxic/anoxic media as the hyporheic areas (e.g. B\u00e4rlocher et al., 2008; \n\nCornut et al., 2011), and that species differ in their tolerance to low levels of O2 \n\n(Medeiros et al., 2009). In fact, it is not completely clear why we registered \n\nincreasing sporulation rates and diversity from no sediment &lt;real sediment &lt;\n\n\n\n! 41!\n\nextra fine sediment; a \u201csurvival\u201d strategy may eventually help to understand the \n\nresults. \n\nSediment cumulating on leaves affected invertebrates consumption. \n\nShredders consumption decreased between 63% (middle) and 76% (bottom) \n\nwhen leaves were buried in the substratum. Although the depth effect of \n\nsediment on leaves decomposition promoted by shredders was previously \n\nstated (Cornut et al., 2010; Sanpera-Calbet et al., 2011; Danger et al., 2012)  \n\nthis is, to my knowledge, the first study where the effect of depth was \n\nconsidered independently of the leaf litter quality as all leaf circles had a similar \n\nconditioning period. S. vittatum larvae seem unable to locate the food source if \n\nsediments are buried. The mechanisms of food location by shredders are still \n\nnot clear, but it seems that the chemical clues possibly guiding the invertebrates \n\nto their food sources (e.g. Rong et al, 1995) may be limited by the presence of \n\nfew centimetres of sediment. It seems possible that a limited burying capacity of \n\nthe invertebrates could constitute an impediment to gain access to buried \n\nleaves; however, according to the Sericostoma larvae distribution in the stream, \n\nthe capacity of digging the sediment does not seem to be an issue. Although a \n\nfiner scale of depths should be further used to assess the effects of sediment \n\ndeposition on invertebrates feeding behaviour (leaves coated by the sediment \n\nseem to be consumed by the invertebrates), this study indicates that sediments \n\ndeposition of over 1.5 cm may inhibit foraging. This may suggest that sediment \n\nloads may clearly affect not only the quality but also the quantity of available \n\nresources to the invertebrates, with potential consequences on population \n\ndynamics. In fact, considering our results, the proclaimed idea that the adverse \n\n\n\n! 42!\n\neffects of sediments are reduced or negligible when they are present in low to \n\nmoderate concentration (Fairchild et al., 1987) might be challenged. \n\nContrary to my expectations, suspended sediments in the microcosms \n\ndid not affect shredders consumption. This is in accordance with Schofield et \n\nal., (2004) and Sanpera-Calbet et al. (2011), but in contradiction with most \n\nstudies (Bunn, 1988; Benfield et al., 2001; Sponseller &amp; Benfield, 2001 and \n\nMatthaei et al., 2010). In fact it seems that this species, like other invertebrates \n\n(e.g. Gammarus; Sanpera-Calbet et al., 2011), may be resistant to short term \n\nstress promoted by sediments, in particular when refuge (stone) and food are \n\navailable. It seems likely that the presence of the case in Sericostoma allows an \n\nadditional protection to the impact of the suspended bed material load. It is still \n\nnot known which is the limit of sediment load tolerated by this species, or what \n\nwould be the impact if this sedimentation lasted for longer periods. Sediment \n\nincrease can have a major influence on several aspects such as biomass, \n\ndiversity and even change in drift behaviour of macroinvertebrates (Quinn et al., \n\n1992; Wood &amp; Armitage, 1997), which tend to support the idea of a threshold of \n\ntolerance for each species, likely modulated by other environmental factors \n\n(e.g. water temperature, pH or current velocity). \n\nBriefly, our laboratorial results suggest that the granulometry of the \n\nsediments may affect the decomposition dynamics through physical \n\nfragmentation, direct and indirect (O2 availability) effects on microbial \n\nassemblages, colonization status and shredders performance. It is generally \n\nrecognized that invertebrates prefer colonized detritus and may present specific \n\nfeeding behaviour towards particular fungal species or assemblages (Canhoto \n\n&amp; Gra\u00e7a 2008). Although it was already stated that leaves burial may affect its \n\n\n\n! 43!\n\nquality due to lower concentration of oxygen, influencing the fungal biomass \n\n(Cornut et al., 2010; Danger et al., 2012), this study contributes to the \n\nrecognition of the sediment impairment on the foraging behaviour promoted by \n\nvery thin layers of sediment. Most likely, sediments accumulation inhibits the \n\ndiffusion of signals needed for food detection. S. vittatum larvae were able to \n\nmaintain their feeding behaviour in the presence of high amounts of suspended \n\nsediments in a turbulent aquatic environment most likely due to its protective \n\ncase. It remains unclear if such behaviour will be maintained for longer periods \n\nand in what extent. \n\nThe effect of sediments transport should be assessed in the future, by \n\ncontrolling flow in natural streams, and during a longer exposure, in order to \n\nunderstand the behaviour of the invertebrates. Also, tests with leaves buried at \n\ndifferent depths and with different shredders should be done. \n\n \n\n4.1. Final Remarks \n\nThere is no doubt that sediment loads are a natural feature of the \n\nstreams; the problem is the unnatural increase of sediment inputs due to \n\nanthropogenic activities. It is therefore fundamental to understand how these \n\nchanges will affect aquatic habitats as well as the whole ecosystem. Activities \n\nlike agriculture and deforestation are becoming a threat to stream ecosystem \n\nfunctions. It is important to take in consideration the recovery of riparian forests, \n\nsince they give the necessary resources for streams and act as a natural \n\nstopper and filter for sediments inputs (Cavalcanti &amp; Lockaby, 2005), also \n\navoiding margins erosion and an intensification on sedimentation and turbidity \n\n(Swank et al., 2001). \n\n\n\n! 44!\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n- References - \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n! 45!\n\n5.
