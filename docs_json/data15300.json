Assim, os\n\nbioensaios laboratoriais sa?o ferramentas fundamentais na determinac?a?o\n\nda ecotoxicidade de um sedimento. Neste estudo foram levados a cabo\n\ndiversos bioensaios.\n\nNuma primeira abordagem foram testados va?rios sedimentos, com a\n\nfinalidade de definir qual a melhor granulometria de sedimento a utilizar\n\nnos testes de toxicidade, para a oligoqueta aqua?tica L. variegatus. Apesar\n\ndos sedimentos finos terem mostrado os melhores resultados para a\n\nsau?de e vitalidade da espe?cie em estudo, sedimentos ecologicamente mais\n\nrelevantes, tais como sedimentos \u201cinteiros\u201d devera?o ser utilizados tanto\n\nnas culturas como nos ensaios de toxicidade.\n\nUma segunda abordagem teve como objectivo desenvolver novos testes\n\nautoma?ticos para toxicidade de sedimentos, utilizando L. variegatus como\n\nespe?cie de estudo e o comportamento como novo para?metro em testes\n\npadra?o. Foram testados diferentes to?xicos: um metal (chumbo) e um pesti-\n\ncida (imidacloprid), representando dois grupos de qu??micos completamente\n\ndiferentes. Foram observadas diferenc?as substanciais no modo de acc?a?o\n\ndos dois to?xicos testados. A exposic?a?o a sedimentos contaminados com\n\nchumbo resultou em n??veis aceita?veis de sobrevive?ncia, o que significa que\n\nocorre acumulac?a?o do metal nos organismos, podendo haver transfere?ncia\n\npara pro?ximas gerac?o?es e organismos de n??veis tro?ficos superiores. A\n\nexposic?a?o ao pesticida, por seu lado, causou elevada mortalidade no ??nicio\n\nda experie?ncia; contudo alguns organismos foram capazes de sobreviver\n\ntanto como os organismos controlo.\n\n\n\nNuma abordagem final foi efectuado um ensaio com sedimentos recolhidos\n\nno campo. O objectivo foi avaliar a toxicidade de sedimentos provenientes\n\nde uma mina abandonada de pirite cu?prica, medindo a mortalidade, cresci-\n\nmento e comportamento de L. variegatus durante 10 dias. O local de\n\nestudo escolhido foi a Mina de Sa?o Domingos (Sul de Portugal), um local\n\ncom grande potencial para estudos ecotoxicolo?gicos, devido a? existe?ncia de\n\num gradiente de pH e de metais provenientes da drenagem a?cida das minas.\n\nOs resultados dos ensaios com L. variegatus indicam forte contaminac?a?o e\n\nos elevados valores encontrados apontam tambe?m para contaminac?a?o sev-\n\nera, o que pode revelar-se um factor limitante na recuperac?a?o ecolo?gica\n\ndaquela a?rea.\n\n\n\nabstract Sediment contamination has become a great concern, since may lead to\n\nwater and food web contamination. When assessing the toxic effects in\n\nthe environment measurements of sediment chemicals provide information\n\non the existing pollutants and their concentrations, but do not provide in-\n\nformation on whether or not these pollutants are biologically damaging.\n\nTherefore, laboratory bioassays are a fundamental tool to determine the\n\necotoxicity of the sediment. In the present study different ecotoxicological\n\ntests were carried out.\n\nSeveral sediments were tested to define the best grain-size to use in sedi-\n\nment toxicity tests, for the aquatic oligochaete L. variegatus. Although fine\n\nsediment showed the best results for health and vitality of the study species,\n\necologically relevant sediments such as whole sediments should be used on\n\nboth culture and toxicity tests.\n\nIn a second stage the purpose was to develop new automated sediment\n\ntoxicity tests using L. variegatus as a test species, with behaviour as a new\n\nparameter to standard tests. Different toxics were tested: a metal (lead)\n\nand a pesticide (imidacloprid), representing two completely different groups\n\nof chemicals. Substantial differences in the action of the two tested toxics\n\nwere observed. Exposure to sediments contaminated with lead showed ac-\n\nceptable rates of survival, meaning that the metal can accumulate in the\n\norganism and metal transfer can occur to next generations and organisms\n\nfrom higher trophic levels. The pesticide caused high mortality at the be-\n\nginning of the experiment, however some organisms were able to live for as\n\nlong as control.\n\nIn a final stage, one assay with field-collected sediments was performed.\n\nThe purpose was to evaluate the toxicity of sediments from an abandoned\n\ncupric pyrite mine, by measuring the 10-day mortality, growth and behaviour\n\nof L. variegatus.\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1 General Introduction 1\n\n1.1 Sediments: definition and concerns . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2\n\n1.2 Sediment contamination in Europe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4\n\n1.3 Assessment of sediment contamination . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\n\n1.4 The choice of a test species . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7\n\n1.4.1 Oligochaetes as test species . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7\n\n1.4.2 Lumbriculus variegatus: biology and importance in ecotoxicology . . . . . 8\n\n1.5 Behaviour as an endpoint in ecotoxicology . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10\n\n1.6 Aims of the research . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12\n\n1.7 References . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13\n\n2 Behaviour, growth and reproduction of Lumbriculus variegatus (Oligochaetae)\n\nin different sediment types 19\n\n3 Short and long-term exposure of Lumbriculus variegatus to metal lead: eco-\n\ntoxicological and behavioural effects 29\n\n4 Assessment of the effects of the pesticide imidacloprid on the behaviour of the\n\naquatic oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus 55\n\n5 Evaluation of sediment toxicity from an abandoned cupric pyrit mine (Por-\n\ntugal) using the aquatic oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus as a test species\n\nand behaviour as an endpoint 85\n\n6 General Discussion and Final Remarks 113\n\n6.1 General Discussion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 114\n\n6.2 Final Remarks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 117\n\n6.3 References . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 118\n\ni\n\n\n\nList of Tables\n\n1.1 Taxonomy of L. variegatus. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n\niii\n\n\n\nList of Figures\n\n1.1 Flow of contaminants, water and sediment from land, through rivers to impacted\n\nareas downstream (SedNet, 2004). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3\n\n1.2 Lumbriculus variegatus. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n\n1.3 Study parameters of this research: level, type of response and classification. . . . 11\n\n6.1 Location of Sa?o Domingos Mine (Adapted from Pereira et al., 2004) . . . . . . . 115\n\nv\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nGeneral Introduction\n\n1\n\n\n\nAna Margarida Sardo\n\n1.1 Sediments: definition and concerns\n\nSediments are dynamic environments with a wide range of interacting processes with variable\n\nrates (US EPA - United States Environmental Agency, 2000a). According to the European\n\nSediment Research Network (SedNet, 2004a) sediments are suspended or deposited solids, of\n\nmineral as well as organic nature, acting as a main component of a matrix, which has been,\n\nor is susceptible to being transported by water. Sediments originate in river basins mainly\n\nthrough land and channel erosion processes and are transported in river systems in the direction\n\nof the coast, with the oceans being the final sink (SedNet, 2004a). The rate of mixing in\n\nsurficial sediment layers by physical processes such as turbulence and bioturbation competes\n\nwith the rate of sedimentation to determine the depth to which contaminated sediment will\n\nbe buried. Diffusion and resuspension can also have a large impact on the bioavailability of\n\nsediment-associated contaminants either by re-exposing epibenthic filter feeders to contaminated\n\nparticulates or by increasing the aqueous concentration of a contaminant via desorption from\n\nthe particulates within the water column (US EPA, 2000a).\n\nSediment dynamics and gradients form favourable conditions for a large biodiversity (Sed-\n\nNet, 2004a). In addition sediment provides habitat for many aquatic organisms and is a major\n\nrepository for many of the more persistent chemicals that are introduced into surface waters\n\n(US EPA, 2000b). In the aquatic environment, most anthropogenic chemicals and waste ma-\n\nterials including toxic organic and inorganic chemicals eventually accumulate in sediment (US\n\nEPA, 2000b). From a contamination point of view, sediments are extremely important to the\n\nfood web and serve both as habitat for the benthic community and as contaminant reservoir\n\nfor bioaccumulation and trophic transfer (Burton and Landrum, 2003). Many contaminants go\n\ninto waters every day from industrial and municipal discharges, urban and agricultural runoff,\n\nand atmospheric deposition from remote sources. Due to their physical and chemical properties\n\nmany of these substances tend to accumulate in sediments. In addition to providing sinks for\n\nmany chemicals, sediments can also serve as potential sources of pollutants to the water column\n\nwhen conditions change in the receiving water system (e.g., during periods of anoxia, after severe\n\nstorms) (US EPA, 2002).\n\nSince the industrial revolution, human-made chemicals have been emitted to surface wa-\n\nters and due to their properties many of these chemicals stick to sediment (SedNet, 2004a).\n\nSediment contamination features an important environmental concern and contaminated sedi-\n\nments have been demonstrated to be toxic to sediment-dwelling organisms and fish. Exposure\n\nto contaminated sediments can result in decreased survival, reduced growth and/or impaired\n\nreproduction in benthic invertebrates and fish. Additionally, certain sediment-associated con-\n\ntaminants (termed bioaccumulative substances) are taken up by benthic organisms through a\n\n2\n\n\n\nNew sediment toxicity tests for Lumbriculus variegatus\n\nprocess called bioaccumulation. When larger animals feed on these contaminated prey species,\n\nthe pollutants are taken into their bodies and are passed along to other animals in the food web\n\nin a process call biomagnification. As a result, benthic organisms, fish, birds, and mammals can\n\nbe adversely affected by contaminated sediments. Contaminated sediments can also compromise\n\nhuman health due to direct exposure when wading, swimming, or through the consumption of\n\ncontaminated fish and shellfish (US EPA, 2002).\n\nFigure 1.1: Flow of contaminants, water and sediment from land, through rivers to impacted\n\nareas downstream (SedNet, 2004).\n\n3\n\n\n\nAna Margarida Sardo\n\nTraditionally, concerns about the management of aquatic resources in freshwater ecosystems\n\nhave focused primarily on water quality. While initiatives undertaken in the past twenty years\n\nhave unquestionably improved water quality conditions, a growing body of evidence indicates\n\nthat management efforts directed solely to attain surface water quality criteria may not provide\n\nan adequate basis for protecting the designated uses of aquatic ecosystems. In recent years,\n\nissues concerning the health and vitality of aquatic ecosystems have begun to re-emerge in North\n\nAmerica. Due to this, many toxic and bioaccumulative chemicals that are only found in trace\n\namounts in water [such as metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls,\n\nchlorophenols, organochlorine pesticides, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers] can accumulate\n\nin higher levels in sediments (US EPA, 2002). Despite the huge effort in research over the past\n\ntwo decades, the ability to assess the impact of contaminated sediments in ecosystems remains a\n\nchallenge that is inherent to the very nature of sediments (Burton and Landrum, 2003; Burton\n\net al., 2007).\n\nThe problem of contaminated sediments is widespread in freshwater and marine systems\n\nthroughout the world. Contaminated sediments can be a long-term source of toxic substances to\n\nthe environment and can impact wildlife and humans through the consumption of food or water\n\nor through direct contact. These impacts may be present even though the overlying water meets\n\nwater quality criteria (US EPA, 1992). At a certain level, contaminants in sediment will start\n\nto impact the ecological or chemical water quality status and complicate sediment management.\n\nIn the end, effects may occur such as the decreased abundance of sediment dwelling (benthic)\n\nspecies or a decreased reproduction health of animals consuming benthic species (SedNet, 2004a).\n\n1.2 Sediment contamination in Europe\n\nThe US EPA estimates that 10% of freshwater sediments in the United States are sufficiently\n\ncontaminated to cause a significant risk to fish, wildlife and humans (US EPA, 1997). Unfortu-\n\nnately, in Europe this issue is less well defined because of non-standardized assessment techniques\n\nand monitoring programs between individual countries (Fleming et al. 1997). The formation\n\nof European Sediment Research Network (SedNet) provided an opportunity to define European\n\ngoals for sediment management and to let these goals drive framework design, resulting in effi-\n\ncient sediment assessment and management (Apitz and Power, 2002). Despite regular sediment\n\nquality assessment, a reliable estimation of the overall amount of contaminated sediment in Eu-\n\nrope is hard to give, mainly because of the absence of uniformity in sampling methods, among\n\nEuropean countries (SedNet, 2004a).\n\nThe European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD), in force since 2000, does not\n\n4\n\n\n\nNew sediment toxicity tests for Lumbriculus variegatus\n\nspecifically address sediment management. However, it can be a tool to tackle the sources\n\nof sediment contamination. It offers an opportunity to further improve the knowledge about the\n\nrelationship between sediment quality and water quality and to harmonise quality assessment and\n\nsediment management on a river-basin scale (SedNet, 2004a). The WFD does not adequately\n\ndeal with \u201csediment\u201d and \u201cdredged material\u201d, although sediments are a natural and essential\n\npart of the aquatic environment and their management has to play an important role within\n\nwater legislation (SedNet, 2004a). The article 16.7 of the WFD states that \u201cthe Commission\n\nshall submit proposals for quality standards applicable to the concentrations of the priority\n\nsubstances in surface waters, sediments and biota\u201d (SedNet, 2004b).\n\nResearch in several European rivers has demonstrated that sediment-associated contaminants\n\ncan have adverse effects on sediment dwelling species (SedNet, 2004a). The abundance of certain\n\nspecies may decrease as a result of sediment contamination, while other more susceptible species\n\nmay disappear completely, resulting in a decreased biodiversity. A decreased abundance results\n\nin a decline in food availability for higher organisms and, thus, disrupting the aquatic ecosystem\n\n(SedNet, 2004a).\n\n1.3 Assessment of sediment contamination\n\nUnfortunately, there is no single method that will measure all contaminated sediment impacts,\n\nat all times and to all biological organisms. This is the result of a number of factors, including\n\nenvironmental heterogeneity and associated sampling problems, variability in the laboratory\n\nexposures, analytical variability, differing sensitivities of different organisms to different types\n\nof contaminants, the confounding effects caused by the presence of unmeasured contaminants,\n\nthe synergistic and antagonistic effects of contaminants, and the physical properties of sediments\n\n(US EPA, 1992). The objective of a sediment test is to determine whether chemicals in sediment\n\nare harmful to or are bioaccumulated by benthic organisms. These tests can be used to measure\n\ninteractive toxic effects of complex chemical mixtures in sediment. Sediment tests can be used\n\nto:\n\n(1) determine the relationship between toxic effects and bioavailability;\n\n(2) investigate interactions among chemicals;\n\n(3) compare the sensitivities of different organisms;\n\n(4) determine spatial and temporal distribution of contamination;\n\n(5) evaluate dredged material;\n\n5\n\n\n\nAna Margarida Sardo\n\n(6) measure toxicity as part of product licensing or safety testing or chemical approval;\n\n(7) rank areas for cleanup, and\n\n(8) set cleanup goals and estimate the effectiveness of remediation or management practices.\n\nTo assess toxicity of contaminated sediments, several standard methods were developed us-\n\ning amphipods, polychaetes, oligochaetes and cladocerans, among others (i.e., OECD, 2006;\n\nASTM, 1999a; ASTM, 1999b; ASTM, 1999c; USEPA, 1994a; USEPA, 1994b). Endpoints such\n\nas survival, growth, reproduction and behaviour are suggested; though, the most frequently used\n\nendpoint is 10-day survival. Short-term tests that only assess survival are useful to detect high\n\nlevels of contamination, but may not be able to identify moderately contaminated sediments\n\n(Sibley et al., 1998; Benoit et al., 1997; Ingersoll et al., 1998). Sublethal responses to toxic\n\nexposure are also common and may indicate the impairment of important organism functions\n\nprior to death (Walker et al. 2001). Some authors also defend that the use of sublethal endpoints\n\ncan provide better evaluations of responses of benthic communities to contaminants in the field\n\n(Kemble et al., 1994).\n\nExisting sediment test methods that include measurement of sublethal endpoints can be\n\nused to provide a rapid and direct measure of effects of contaminants on benthic communities.\n\nLaboratory testing with field-collected sediment can also be carried out to determine temporal,\n\nhorizontal, or vertical distribution of contaminants in sediment. Furthermore, sediment tests\n\nwith complex contaminant mixtures are important tools for making decisions about the extent\n\nof remedial action for contaminated aquatic sites and for evaluating the success of remediation\n\nactivities (US EPA, 2000b).\n\nThe use of sediment tests presents some advantages: (1) Sediment tests measure the bioavail-\n\nable fraction of contaminant(s); (2) Sediment tests provide a direct measure of benthic effects,\n\nassuming no field adaptation or amelioration of effects; (3) Limited special equipment is required\n\nfor testing; (4) Ten-day toxicity test methods are rapid and inexpensive; (5) Legal and scien-\n\ntific precedence exists for use; ASTM standard guides are available; (6) Sediment tests measure\n\nunique information relative to chemical analyses or benthic community analyses; (7) Tests with\n\nspiked chemicals provide data on cause-effect relationships; (8) Sediment toxicity tests can be\n\napplied to all chemicals of concern; (9) Tests applied to field samples reflect cumulative effects\n\nof contaminants and contaminant interactions; (10) Toxicity tests are amenable to confirmation\n\nwith natural benthos populations (US EPA, 2000b, Modified from Swartz (1989)).\n\nOn the other hand, some disadvantages can be pointed out: (1) Sediment collection, han-\n\ndling, and storage may alter bioavailability; (2) Spiked sediment may not be representative of\n\nfield-contaminated sediment; (3) Natural geochemical characteristics of sediment may affect the\n\n6\n\n\n\nNew sediment toxicity tests for Lumbriculus variegatus\n\nresponse of test organisms; (4) Indigenous animals may be present in field-collected sediments;\n\n(5) Route of exposure may be uncertain and data generated in sediment toxicity tests may be\n\ndifficult to interpret if factors controlling the bioavailability of contaminants in sediment are\n\nunknown; (6) Tests applied to field samples may not discriminate effects of individual chemicals;\n\n(7) Few comparisons have been made of methods or species; (8) Only a few chronic methods for\n\nmeasuring sublethal effects have been developed or extensively evaluated; (9) Laboratory tests\n\nhave inherent limitations in predicting ecological effects (US EPA, 2000b, Modified from Swartz\n\n(1989)).\n\n1.4 The choice of a test species\n\nThe choice of a test organism has a major influence on the relevance, success, and interpreta-\n\ntion of a test. Both practical concerns and environmental relevance are crucial on the choice of\n\nthe test organism (DeWitt et al., 1989; Swartz, 1989). Ideally, a test organism should have a tox-\n\nicological database demonstrating relative sensitivity and discrimination to a range of chemicals\n\nof concern in sediment; should also have a database for interlaboratory comparisons of proce-\n\ndures (e.g., round-robin studies); be in contact with sediment (e.g., water column vs. benthic\n\norganism); be readily available through culture or from field collection; be easily maintained\n\nin the laboratory; be easily identified; be ecologically or economically important; have a broad\n\ngeographical distribution, be indigenous (either present or historical) to the site being evaluated,\n\nor have a niche similar to organisms of concern (e.g., similar feeding guild or behaviour to the\n\nindigenous organisms); be tolerant of a broad range of sediment physico-chemical characteristics\n\n(e.g., grain size); and be compatible with selected exposure methods and endpoints (ASTM,\n\n1999d).\n\nThe existence of information concerning relative sensitivity of the organisms (both to single\n\nchemicals and complex mixtures) should be an important consideration in the selection of specific\n\nspecies (US EPA, 2000b). The route of exposure and biochemical response to chemicals is related\n\nto the sensitivity of an organism. Sediment-dwelling organisms can receive exposure from three\n\nprimary sources: interstitial water, sediment particles, and overlying water. Food type, feeding\n\nrate, assimilation efficiency, and clearance rate will control the dose of chemicals from sediment\n\n(US EPA, 2000b).\n\n1.4.1 Oligochaetes as test species\n\nOligochaete worms are key macroinvertebrate constituents of terrestrial and freshwater ecosys-\n\ntems (Edwards and Lofty, 1977; Brinkhurst and Gelder, 1991) and aquatic species are important\n\n7\n\n\n\nAna Margarida Sardo\n\ncontributors to the functioning of lotic foodwebs (Benke and Jacobi, 1994; Thorp and Delong,\n\n2002). Locomotion and other behavioural activities of these organisms are significant determi-\n\nnants of the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soils and sediments. In addition,\n\nlocomotor functions are the cornerstone of such vital functions as foraging, sexual reproduction,\n\npredator avoidance, dispersal, and general orientation to environmental cues (Drewes, 1997).\n\nBecause feeding rates are relatively high the so-called \u201cconveyor-belt\u201d feeding exhibited by many\n\noligochaetes (including L.variegatus) results in the regular reworking of the top layer of sed-\n\niment, which can have profound effects on the properties of sediments and overlying waters\n\n(Robbins, 1982). Oligochaetes are infaunal benthic organisms that meet many of the test cri-\n\nteria listed. Certain oligochaete species are easily handled and cultured, provide reasonable\n\nbiomass for residue analyses, and are tolerant of varying sediment physical and chemical charac-\n\nteristics. Oligochaetes are exposed to chemicals via all appropriate routes of exposure, including\n\npore water and ingestion of sediment particles (US EPA, 2000b).\n\nAquatic oligochaetes have an extremely long history of use for pollution assessments (Chap-\n\nman, 2001) and were used in several studies both to assess metal pollution (Phipps et al., 1995;\n\nHansen et al., 1996; Veltz-Balatre et al., 2000; Ingersoll et al., 2002; Demuynck et al., 2006;\n\nRedeker et al., 2007) and also pesticide pollution (Drewes, 1997; Zou et al., 2007; Amorim et\n\nal., 2008; Garcia et al., 2008). Oligochaetes offer a rare experimental advantage for behav-\n\nioral toxicology - the ability to non-invasively detect spiking from identified interneurons and\n\nmotorneurons that mediate rapid escape responses (Drewes, 1997).\n\n1.4.2 Lumbriculus variegatus: biology and importance in ecotoxicology\n\nLumbriculus variegatus (Mu?ller 1774) is a freshwater oligochaete of the family Lumbriculidae\n\n(Table 1.1), found throughout North America and Europe. It prefers shallow habitats at the\n\nedges of ponds, lakes, or marshes where it feeds on decaying vegetation and microorganisms\n\n(Brinkhurst and Gelder 1991) and it tolerates a wide range of substrates (US EPA, 2000b).\n\nWorms cultured in the laboratory are usually small (4-6 cm in length), compared to field\n\ncollected worms, and never reach sexual maturity or produce cocoons. Reproduction under\n\nlaboratory conditions is always by asexual fragmentation, during which a worm spontaneously\n\ndivides into two or more body fragments. Each surviving fragment then undergoes rapid regen-\n\neration of body segments to form a new head end, tail end, or both ends (Brinkhurst and Gelder\n\n1991). Eventually, each fragment grows into a normal sized worm comprising a combination of\n\nolder and newer segments, representing two or more \u201cgenerations\u201d of development (Lesiuk and\n\nDrewes, 1999). The regeneration is achieved after 7 days at 20?C and goes through eight char-\n\nacteristic stages, even if the sectioning is artificially induced (Veltz-Balatre, 2000). L.variegatus\n\n8\n\n\n\nNew sediment toxicity tests for Lumbriculus variegatus\n\nTable 1.1: Taxonomy of L. variegatus.\n\nPhylum Annelida\n\nClass Oligochaeta\n\nOrder Lumbriculida\n\nFamily Lumbriculidae\n\nGenus Lumbriculus\n\nSpecies Lumbriculus variegatus (Mu?ller 1774)\n\nCommon names California blackworms, blackworms, mudworms\n\nhas a remarkable capacity for regeneration of lost body segments (epimorphosis) and for neural\n\nplasticity within original body segments (morphallaxis) following injury-induced fragmentation\n\n(Hyman, 1916).\n\nFigure 1.2: Lumbriculus variegatus.\n\nL.variegatus is recommended for use in toxicity tests with sediments based on ease of culture\n\nand handling, known chemical exposure history, adequate tissue mass for chemical analysis, tol-\n\nerance of a wide range of sediment physical-chemical characteristics, low sensitivity (in terms of\n\n9\n\n\n\nAna Margarida Sardo\n\nmortality) to contaminants associated with sediment, and amenability to long-term exposures\n\nwithout feeding (Ingersoll et al., 2003). This species has been proposed by the American Society\n\nof Testing and Materials (ASTM, 1995) as a standard organism for tests of sediment bioaccumu-\n\nlation and is listed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD,\n\n1992) as a good organism for bioaccumulation studies. The response of L.variegatus in labora-\n\ntory bioaccumulation studies has been confirmed with natural populations of oligochaetes (US\n\nEPA, 2000b). Judging by the number of internationally published articles, the most common\n\nOligochaeta species used in evaluations of freshwater toxicity has been L. variegatus (Hansen et\n\nal., 1996; Leppa?nen, 1999; Veltz-Balatre et al., 2000; Ingersoll et al., 2002).\n\n1.5 Behaviour as an endpoint in ecotoxicology\n\nMortality, bioaccumulation, growth and reproduction have been the most common endpoints\n\nused in the vast majority of studies in environmental toxicology (Leppa?nen and Kukkonen, 1998).\n\nThere is a lack of data regarding sublethal toxicological endpoints, such as effects on growth,\n\nreproduction, morphology or behaviour. Without this kind of information, the complex biological\n\nactions cannot be fully understood and reliable predictions of ecological impacts of environmental\n\ntoxicants cannot be made (Rogge and Drewes, 1993).\n\nBehaviour is a sublethal parameter readily altered by stress (Beitinger, 1990) and it is con-\n\nsidered as a promising tool in ecotoxicological studies (Cohn and MacPhail 1996). The use of\n\nthis parameter as an endpoint has some advantages since behavioural differences can be easily\n\nrelated to the fitness of individuals, which means that this endpoint is a real biomarker of effect.\n\nNevertheless, the lack of standardised methods can be a major downside, as well as the possible\n\ninfluence of biotic and abiotic factors (Capowiez et al., 2003). Since behaviour integrates many\n\ncellular processes that are vital to the organism\u2019s survival and reproduction, it can be considered\n\nas an excellent tool when evaluation of toxicity of chemicals needs to be made (Janssen et al.,\n\n1994). Behaviour is probably an important path to search for mechanisms of toxicity (Macedo-\n\nSousa, 2007) and once we are able to quantify this parameter, it has the potential to be used as a\n\nbiomarker in the assessment of stress (Beitinger, 1990). Biomonitoring should rely on sublethal\n\nendpoints rather than mortality alone (Macedo-Sousa, 2007).\n\nSince the early 1970s, contaminants have been shown to affect virtually every aspect of be-\n\nhaviour in terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Behaviour integrates many cellular processes as is\n\nessential to the viability of the organism, population and community. Therefore, observations of\n\nbehaviour provide a unique toxicological perspective: one that links the biochemical and ecolog-\n\n10\n\n\n\nNew sediment toxicity tests for Lumbriculus variegatus\n\nFigure 1.3: Study parameters of this research: level, type of response and classification.\n\nical consequences of environmental contamination (Little, 1990).\n\nMany toxicants are known to alter the behaviour of aquatic biota (Weis et al., 2001). Contam-\n\ninants can induce behavioural or defensive responses that may change the outcome of biological\n\ninteractions or even intensify the effect of a contaminant (Fleeger et al., 2003).\n\nDuring the last decades, there has been an increasing interest in investigating sublethal end-\n\npoints (Aisemberg et al., 2005) and some studies used behaviour as an endpoint. West and\n\nAnkley (1998) believe that behaviour may be a useful tool in the assessment of contaminated\n\nsediments. However, as with other endpoints, an important aspect of assay validation is con-\n\nducting field studies to determine predictive capabilities (West and Ankley, 1998). Loureiro et\n\nal (2005) observed avoidance behaviour in both isopods and earthworms and based on the rapid\n\ninformation obtained, suggested that avoidance behaviour tests should be regarded as a valuable\n\ntool in the screening evaluation of soil contamination. A study by De Lange (2006) showed that\n\nbehaviour is a much more sensitive endpoint than growth or survival, based on results obtained\n\nfrom the activity of Gammarus pulex. Several aspects of changes in the swimming behaviour\n\nof fish caused by sublethal exposure to xenobiotics have been used as sensitive indicators of\n\n11\n\n\n\nAna Margarida Sardo\n\ntoxic stress (Diamond et al., 1990; Little and Finger, 1990). O\u2019Gara et al (2004) documented\n\nthe adverse effects of copper exposure on the locomotory and escape behaviour of the aquatic\n\noligochaete L. variegatus, which reduces the ability to escape from predators.\n\nBehavioural parameters reflect biochemical changes and have ecological consequences (La-\n\ngadic et al., 1995, Janssen et al., 1994), they are one of the most sensitive responses to occur\n\nand are non-destructive. These facts suggest that responses based on behaviour are optimal for\n\ncost-effective and ecologically relevant toxicity evaluations and very adequate for biological early\n\nwarning systems.\n\nBased on behavioural responses to toxics some online biomonitoring systems have been de-\n\nveloped, using different organisms as sensors. Some examples are the Koblenz behavioural fish\n\ntest, the Dreissena-Monitor and the Mussel-Monitor (Untersteiner et al., 2003). Video tracking\n\nis a popular method to assess behaviour, with very good results (Alchanatis et al., 2000; Un-\n\ntersteiner et al., 2003; Venkateswara et al., 2006). However, studying oligochaete behaviour is\n\ndifficult, since these organisms tend to be buried in the sediment, which excludes methods like\n\nvideo tracking as an option to assess behaviour.\n\n1.6 Aims of the research\n\nWith the main aim of developing new behavioural online sediment toxicity tests for L.variegatus,\n\nthis thesis includes initial experiments to gather information about good culture practices (Chap-\n\nter 2), studies with toxics as different as metal (Chapter 3) and pesticide (Chapter 4) and a final\n\nstep with a field case study (Chapter 5).\n\nBellow is a brief explanation of the steps taken.\n\n- Behaviour, growth and reproduction of Lumbriculus variegatus (Oligochaetae)\n\nin different sediment types. (Chapter 2) In this preliminary study, locomotory activity\n\nof L. variegatus was used to determine appropriate sediment (based on grain-size) for\n\nstandard sediment toxicity tests. Assessments included measures of behaviour, growth\n\nand reproduction. A large amount of literature is available about the laboratorial culture\n\nconditions for L.variegatus, but the majority use paper towels as subtract. In this work a\n\nmore realistic approach was proposed, using sediment as subtract in order to understand\n\nwhat grain-size was more suitable for this species growth and behaviour. In addition,\n\nlocomotory behaviour of adults from a normal and a clone population was studied.\n\n- Short and long-term exposure of Lumbriculus variegatus (Oligochaetae) to\n\nmetal lead: ecotoxicological and behavioural effects. (Chapter 3) After a care-\n\nful study of the best conditions for culture and the best conditions to record behavioural\n\n12\n\n\n\nNew sediment toxicity tests for Lumbriculus variegatus\n\nsignals, there was an attempt to develop a new automated sediment toxicity test using\n\nL.variegatus and to assess differences between short and long-term exposures. In addition,\n\nthis study investigated the use of behaviour of L.variegatus as a new parameter to standard\n\ntoxicity tests. Lead was chosen as chemical stressor since is a well know polluter and due\n\nto its affinity to sediment particles.\n\n- Assessment of the effects of the pesticide imidacloprid on the behaviour of the\n\naquatic oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus. (Chapter 4) Imidacloprid has been\n\nfound in streams and rivers and is likely to be bioavailable to aquatic organisms. Because\n\nthere were few studies on the toxicity of imidacloprid to relevant lotic species (Alexander et\n\nal, 2007), here we investigated the impact of imidacloprid on the behaviour of the aquatic\n\noligochaete L.variegatus. In this study, a new automated sediment toxicity test using\n\nL.variegatus was developed to assess differences between short and long-term exposures\n\nto different concentrations of the pesticide. In addition, this study investigated the use of\n\nbehaviour of L.variegatus as a tool to assess sublethal effects of a toxic substance.\n\n- Evaluation of sediment toxicity from an abandoned cupric pyrite mine (Portu-\n\ngal) using the aquatic oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus as test species and\n\nbehaviour as an endpoint. (Chapter 5) In this research work a new approach for on-\n\nline biomonitoring using field contaminated sediments was developed. This new approach\n\ncombined behavioural and standard toxicity parameters, such as mortality and growth of\n\nL.variegatus. The main goal of this work was to evaluate the toxicity of sediments from an\n\nabandoned cupric pyrite mine, by measuring the 10-day mortality, growth and behaviour\n\nof L.variegatus. Other tested parameters included TOC, AVS, grain size and metals in sed-\n\niment and in whole-body. One major challenge in this study was the presence of chemical\n\nmixtures, a common feature in field-collected sediments. The study site was Sa?o Domingos\n\nMine, a potentially good site for ecotoxicological studies, due to a pH and metal gradient\n\nof acid mine drainage.\n\nThe final chapter (Chapter 6) of the present thesis constitutes a general discussion and final\n\nremarks of the research. Throughout the thesis we suggest possible future studies.\n\n1.7 References\n\nAisemberg J, Nahabedian DE, Wider EA, Verrengia-Guerrero NR. 2005.

The\n\nlocomotory behavior of adults from a normal and a clone population was studied in\nthe Multispecies Freshwater BiomonitorTM along with growth and reproduction to\ndetermine how different sediment types may affect this worm and forced clones dur-\ning testing. Four different sand size classes were established by sieving: fine (<1 mm),\nmedium (1 &lt;\u00d7 &lt;2 mm), coarse (>2 mm), and whole sediment. Locomotory ac-\ntivity was highest in fine and then in coarse sediment, while in whole and medium\nsediment size classes worms grew and reproduced less, and had lower locomotory\nactivity levels. Fine sediment (<1 mm) should be used as the negative control in\nL. variegatus whole sediment toxicity tests. A clone population, generated by cut-\nting all worms over six generations, showed lower locomotory activity levels than\nnormal worms. Artificial cloning is not recommended for obtaining additional test\norganisms.\n\nKey Words: Lumbriculus variegatus, sediment toxicity, behavior, growth, reproduc-\ntion, Multispecies Freshwater BiomonitorTM.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAquatic oligochaetes have an extremely long history of use for pollution assess-\nments (Chapman 2001). Lumbriculus variegatus is a freshwater oligochaete of the fam-\nily Lumbriculidae, found throughout North America and Europe. It prefers shallow\nhabitats at the edges of ponds, lakes, or marshes where it feeds on decaying vegetation\nand microorganisms (Brinkhurst and Gelder 1991). It is widely used in sediment tox-\nicity testing (Dermott and Munawar 1992; Phipps et al. 1993; USEPA 2000; Ingersoll\net al. 2003). Worms cultured in the laboratory are usually small (4\u20136 cm in length)\ncompared to field collected worms, and never reach sexual maturity or produce co-\ncoons. Reproduction under laboratory conditions is always by asexual fragmentation,\nduring which a worm spontaneously divides into two or more body fragments.

L. variegatus has\na remarkable capacity for regeneration of lost body segments (epimorphosis) and\nfor neural plasticity within original body segments (morphallaxis) following injury-\ninduced fragmentation. Lumbriculidae body fragments regenerate eight new head\nsegments and tails of variable lengths (Drewes and Fourtner 1990; Martinez et al.\n2006).\n\nThe Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor\u00a9R (MFB) measures, in an automatic and\nquantitative manner, different behaviors of aquatic species in an electrical field of\nhigh frequency alternating current, caused by movements of the organisms in their\ntest chambers (Gerhardt et al. 1994; Gerhardt 2000). The individual test organism\nis placed in a cylindrical flow-through test chamber with two pairs of stainless steel-\nplate electrodes, attached at the opposite chamber walls. One pair generates a high\nfrequency alternating current, the other non-current carrying electrode pair senses\nimpedance changes due to the movements of the organism in the electrical field\n(record time: 4 min; interval: 6 min). Different types of behavior generate charac-\nteristic electrical signals (Gerhardt 1999, 2000). The electrical signals are processed\nby a discrete Fast Fourier Transformation and generate a histogram of the occur-\nrence of all signal frequencies in % (summarized in intervals of O.5 Hz from 0 to\n10 Hz), hence yielding a \u201cfingerprint\u201d of the behavioral pattern of the organism.\nThis transformation gives the percentage of occurrence of each single frequency\nduring the record of 4 min. The unit of measurement is the test chamber, which can\nhave different sizes, forms, materials and arrangements of electrodes. This method\nhas been shown to be a valuable biomonitoring and toxicity testing tool using epi-\nbenthic crustaceans, insects, and planktonic and pelagic species of fish and tadpoles\n(Gerhardt 2000).\n\nThe main purpose of the present study is to define the best sediment types for use\nof L. variegatus in sediment toxicity tests, based on grain-size. Assessments included\nmeasures of behavior, growth, and reproduction.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nSediment Grain Size Classes\n\nL. variegatus were kindly provided from an existing culture at the University of\nJoensuu (Finland), by Matti Leppa?nen. The cultures, each with 50 worms, were\nreared in plastic aquaria (8.5 \u00d7 17.5 \u00d7 12 cm), covered with lids, containing ASTM\n(ASTM 1980) water (pH 7.6 \u00b1 0.3), at 20?C, in a CT-room (16:8 h light:dark cycle\nand 50% humidity). A commercially available sand-pebble mixture (grain sizes: 0\u2013\n8 mm) was acid washed (pH 2) and ashed (4 h, 450?C). Afterwards it was sieved\nin different size classes (fine:&lt;1 mm; medium: 1 mm &lt;\u00d7 &lt;2 mm; coarse: >2\nmm; whole sediment\u2014sediment that had minimal manipulation (USEPA 2000)).\nEach plastic PE-aquarium comprised a 2 cm layer of one sediment class size with\ncontinuous and moderated aeration of the overlying water. The entire water volume\nwas renewed every 10 days. 30 worms were fed with approximately 5 mg powdered\nTetraMin:Tetraphyll (1:1), applied 2 to 3 times a week. The behavior of the worms\nkept in different sediment sizes was tested with the MFB after 2.5 and 5 months,\n\n520 Hum. Ecol. Risk Assess.

For MFB tests,\n4 worms from each sediment size were used, during 24 h, in chambers filled with\n50% ASTM water and 50% sediment. For this test, the chambers (10 mm diameter)\nhad 2 pairs of stainless steel electrodes positioned opposite to each other: one pair\ngenerated the high frequency electric field and the other pair sensed impedance\nchanges in electric field caused by movements of the worms. Three chambers were\nused as controls, filled with 50% whole-sediment and 50% ASTM water and without\nworms in order to evaluate potential external disturbance signals.\n\nClone Population\n\nThe population was reared in a plastic aquarium (7 \u00d7 13.5 \u00d7 10 cm), covered with\nlids, containing ASTM (ASTM 1980) water (pH 7.6 \u00b1 0.3), at 20?C, in a CT-room\n(16:8 h light:dark cycle and 50% humidity). A 2 cm layer of fine sediment was added\nto the plastic aquarium. Continuous and moderated aeration was provided. Using\na plastic pipette, the worms were transferred from the culture aquarium to a Petri\ndish. The excess water was withdrawn and 25 adults of L. variegatus were cut in two\npieces each with a stiletto. Water was renewed every 10 days; 30 worms were fed with\napproximately 5 mg of Tetraphyll, applied 2 to 3 times a week; all organisms were\ncut once a month. Differences between normal and clone worms were studied with\nthe MFB, in chambers filled with half ASTM water and half sediment. Activities were\nmeasured continuously over tracks of 4 min in 10 min intervals for a period of 24 h.\nThe chambers and the controls used were the same as for the previous test.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nNormality and homoscedasticity were tested using the Software Package Sigma-\nStat for Windows, version 3.1. As the data were non-normal, the chosen statistic\nwas non-parametric. The overall effect of the sediment on population behavior was\ninvestigated using a Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on ranks (p &lt;0.001) (Zar 1996); the\nDunn\u2019s method post-hoc test was run to check for significant differences (p &lt;0.05),\nalso using SigmaStat.\n\nRESULTS\n\nSediment Grain Size Classes\n\nThe populations in four different sediment sizes and the clones are easy and not\nexpensive to maintain. The results (Figure 1) show that worms prefer the fine sed-\niment and reproduce better, a significant trend (p &lt;0.05) which was followed up\nfor two and a half months. After two and a half months (Table 1), worms reared in\ncoarse and whole sediment were more active in the same sediment size class than\nthose reared and exposed in fine and medium sediment (p &lt;0.05). Band 1 rep-\nresented signal frequencies between 0.5 and 1.0 Hz, corresponding to L. variegatus\nperistaltic movements. Band 2 corresponded to whole body locomotory movements\nbetween 1.0 and 3.0 Hz. The activities of worms cultured in different sizes of sediment\nwere all significantly different (p &lt;0.05) in both bands (Table 2).\n\nHum. Ecol. Risk Assess.

Hence, after a long culture time, the culture stabilized and\nthe measured spontaneous locomotory activities represent exactly the \u201cstate\u201d of the\ncultures: the healthier and numerous cultures (fine and coarse) had the higher\nactivities, whereas whole and medium sediment worms grew and reproduced less\nand had lower activities. Statistical analysis (Table 2) showed that, after five months,\nthere were significant differences between the worms\u2019 activities on band 1 (peri-\nstaltic movements) except while comparing fine and coarse and coarse and whole\nworms. On band 2 (locomotion) there were significant differences in worms from\nall sediments except when comparing worms in fine and coarse sediment.\n\nClone Population\n\nThere was no mortality after 24 h, which means that cutting did not increase\nmortality rates. The culture of forced clone worms was marked by induced regen-\neration. Due to artificial segmentation, the worms did not reproduce themselves by\n\nTable 1.

When comparing MFB signals from normal (cultured in all\nthe sediment sizes) and forced clone worms (Table 2; Figure 3), significant differ-\nences (p &lt;0.05) were found. Normal worms were much more active than clones,\nand had high activity in terms of peristaltic movements (band 1) and more locomo-\ntion (band 2), except when compared with medium sediment, where worms were\nless active (Table 3).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nFine sediment proved to be the best for the health and vitality of L. variegatus,\nand should be used as reference test material in culture as well as in toxicity tests\nof the species. Ecologically relevant sediment toxicity tests typically use whole sedi-\nment, however in doing so it must be recognized that these may comprise less than\nideal sediments for the organism, affecting behavior, growth, and reproduction.\nFine sediment should be used as the laboratory control for this test, although eco-\nlogical relevance requires comparisons between exposed and field reference whole\nsediments.\n\nCulture of forced clone worms was marked by induced regeneration, and due\nto this artificial process, the worms did not reproduce by asexual reproduction.\nAlthough the process of forming new anterior or posterior ends during a round of\nfission is sometimes loosely referred to as \u201cregeneration,\u201d the two processes (fission\nand regeneration) are biologically very different. Regeneration is triggered when\n\nTable 3.

In contrast, fission (either architomy or paratomy) is initiated by the\nworm itself, and is thus at some level predictable. It is therefore possible, perhaps even\nlikely, that the worm prepares itself physiologically or developmentally for the latter\nevent (Bely 1999). This discrepancy in behavior between fission and regeneration\nprocesses can explain the differences found in this study, between natural and cloned\nworms.\n\nAn important assumption in ecotoxicology is that results of biotests obtained in\nthe laboratory are relevant and reasonable approximations of natural environmen-\ntal conditions. Empirical and theoretical studies have shown that small and isolated\npopulations decrease in their genetic allelic richness over time and that this genetic\nimpoverishment may result in reduced health, adult sterility, and a high sensitivity\nto environmental stress (Frankham et al. 2002). High degrees of genetic impov-\nerishment in laboratory cultures of ecotoxicological model organisms could have\nsevere effects on their response to environmental contaminants and thus lead to bi-\nased estimates of the tested chemicals\u2019 toxicity. For example, Nowak et al. (personal\ncommunication) have shown that laboratory cultures of Chironomus riparius exhibit\nmuch lower levels of genetic variation (allelic richness) than field populations. In\nthe present study, after a few generations the worms generated by cloning showed a\ndecrease in movement, which may indicate genetic impoverishment.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis study showed that fine sediment (<1 mm) is most suitable to achieve healthy,\nactive, and numerous worm cultures and should be used as the negative control when\nusing L. variegatus in sediment toxicity tests. The forced (artificially induced) clone\npopulation was marked by induced regeneration, less growth and less locomotory\nactivity compared to normal worms. Accordingly, artificial cloning is not a recom-\nmended method to obtain additional test organisms.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors express their gratitude to Matti Leppa?nen and to Jussi Kukkonen for\nproviding us the worms for starting our culture and to Peter Chapman for his useful\nedits of the manuscript prior to publication.

Some aquatic species can help \n\nunderstand and even predict the impact of those contaminants. Lumbriculus variegatus is a \n\nrecommended species to use in sediment toxicity tests and is known to have a remarkable ability of \n\nsegmental regeneration. A short (10 days) and a long-term (28 days) toxicity test was used to test the \n\neffects (short and long-term) of a metal in survival, growth and behaviour of L. variegatus. This work aims \n\nto investigate and validate the use of behaviour as a new parameter in standard toxicity tests. Lead was \n\nchosen as chemical stressor due to its known affinity to sediment particles. Worms were exposed to \n\nsediments contaminated with different levels of lead and the results indicated a positive relation between \n\nlead concentrations and mortality and growth: higher lead concentrations resulted in higher mortalities \n\nand strong inhibitions in growth. An inhibition of behaviour was observed and results suggested that \n\nalthough behaviour could not be used in sediment toxicity tests, it can be proved useful as an addition to \n\nshort-term tests and helps select sediments. Thus, exposure to sediments contaminated with lead affect \n\nthe presence of this species in nature, because interferes with growth and with survival. \n\n \n\nKey-words: Lumbriculus variegatus, lead, metal, sediment, Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor, \n\nbehaviour, ecotoxicology, biomonitoring, early warning \n\n\n\n \n\n   32 \n\nIntroduction  \n\nThe vast majority of studies in environmental toxicology use mortality, bioaccumulation, growth \n\nand reproduction as endpoints (Lepp\u00e4nen and Kukkonen, 1998). Therefore, there is a lack of data \n\nregarding sublethal toxicological endpoints, such as effects on development, fecundity, morphology, \n\nbehaviour or physiology. Without this kind of information, the complex biological actions cannot be fully \n\nunderstood and reliable predictions of ecological impacts of environmental toxicants cannot be made \n\n(Rogge and Drewes, 1993). During the last decades, there has been an increasing interest to investigate \n\nother sublethal endpoints (Aisemberg et al, 2005). Behaviour is a sublethal parameter readily altered by \n\nstress (Beitinger, 1990) and it is considered as a promising tool in ecotoxicology studies (Cohn and \n\nMacPhail 1996). Locomotion in particular has been found to be a consistently sensitive measure of toxic \n\nstress for a wide range of environmental contamination (Little and Finger, 1990). Behavioural changes \n\nmay have ecological consequences, e.g. avoidance behaviour or decreased activity may influence \n\npopulation levels by affecting migration or susceptibility to predation (Gerhardt, 1995). Biomonitoring \n\nshould rely on sublethal endpoints rather than mortality alone (Macedo-Sousa et al, 2007). Biomonitoring \n\ninstruments have been proved to have the best deterrent effect upon polluters (Gerhardt, 2000) \n\naddressing the need to determine the effects of pollutants on benthic invertebrates (Macedo-Sousa et al, \n\n2007).  \n\nOligochaete worms are key marcoinvertebrate and play a major role in terrestrial and freshwater \n\necosystems (Edwards and Lofty, 1977; Brinkhurst and Gelder, 1991) contributing to the functioning of \n\nlotic foodwebs (Benke and Jacobi, 1994; Thorp and Delong, 2002), reason why they were chosen as test \n\nspecies in the present study. Locomotion and other behavioural activities of these organisms are \n\nsignificant determinants of the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soils and sediments. In \n\naddition, locomotor functions are the cornerstone of such vital functions as foraging, sexual reproduction, \n\npredator avoidance, dispersal, and general orientation to environmental cues (Drewes, 1997). Aquatic \n\noligochaetes have an extremely long history of use in pollution assessments (Chapman, 2001). \n\nLumbriculus variegatus (M\u00fcller 1774) is recommended for use in toxicity tests with sediments based on \n\n\n\n \n\n   33 \n\nease of culture and handling, known chemical exposure history, adequate tissue mass for chemical \n\nanalysis, tolerance to a wide range of sediment physical-chemical characteristics, low sensitivity (in terms \n\nof mortality) to contaminants associated with sediment, and amenability to long-term exposures without \n\nfeeding (Ingersoll et al, 2003). This species has been proposed by the American Society of Testing and \n\nMaterials (ASTM, 1995) as a standard organism for tests of sediment bioaccumulation and is listed by the \n\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 1992) as a good organism for \n\nbioaccumulation studies. L. variegatus is a freshwater oligochaete known to have remarkable powers of \n\nsegmental regeneration (Hyman, 1916). Reproduction under laboratory conditions is always by asexual \n\nfragmentation, during which a worm spontaneously divides into two or more body fragments (Lesiuk and \n\nDrewes, 1999).  \n\nLead is a metal well known as a toxic material (IPCS, 1995) that occurs naturally in the \n\nenvironment.  However, most of the lead found throughout the environment comes from human activities \n\n(ATSDR, 1997). Lead may interfere with the essential metal metabolism of a range of plants and animals \n\n(Behra, 1993). A significant toxic effect of lead, although indirect, might be indicated if organisms showed \n\nsome form of adaptive tolerance to the metal (Posthuma and van Straalen, 1993). \n\nThe Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor\u00ae (MFB) measures online different behaviours of \n\naquatic species, based on the registration of changes in a high frequency alternating current that are \n\ncaused by movements of the organisms in their test chambers (Gerhardt et al., 1994; Gerhardt, 2000b). \n\nThe individual test organism is placed in a flow-through cylindrical test chamber with two pairs of stainless \n\nsteel-plate electrodes, attached at the opposite chamber walls. One pair generates a high frequency \n\nalternating current, the other non-current carrying electrode pair senses impedance changes due to the \n\nmovements of the organism in the electrical field (record time: 4 min; interval: 6 min). Different types of \n\nbehaviour generate characteristical electrical signals (Gerhardt, 1999, 2000b). The electrical signals are \n\nprocessed by a discrete Fast Fourier Transformation and generate a histogram of the occurrence of all \n\nfrequencies in % (summarized in intervals of O.S Hz from 0 to 10 Hz), hence yielding a \u201dfingerprint\u201d of the \n\nbehavioural pattern of the organism. This transformation gives the percentage of occurrence of each \n\n\n\n \n\n   34 \n\nsingle frequency during the record of 4 min. This method has already shown to be a valuable \n\nbiomonitoring and toxicity testing tool using epi-benthic crustaceans, insects, as well as planktonic and \n\npelagic species of fish and tadpoles (Gerhardt, 2000b). Behavioural responses may have a role in \n\nsearching mechanisms of toxicity and the MFB, as a sophisticated device, may help to explore those \n\nmechanisms (Gerhardt et al, 2005). \n\nThere is a need for further research on the toxicity of metals to freshwater invertebrates and this \n\nshould concentrate on the effects of sublethal exposures (Bat, 2000). The aims of this study were to \n\ndevelop a new automated sediment toxicity test using L. variegatus and to assess differences between \n\nshort and long-term exposures. Furthermore, this study investigated the use of behaviour of L. variegatus \n\nas a new parameter to standard toxicity tests. The hypothesis was that the presence of lead would cause \n\nbehavioural early warning responses, particularly on locomotion and peristaltic movements. \n\n \n\nMaterial and Methods \n\nCulture - Laboratory cultures of Lumbriculus variegatus (M\u00fcller 1774) used throughout these tests \n\noriginated from the University of Joensuu, Finland.  Animals were reared in a PE (Polyethylene) aquarium \n\n(8.5 x 17.5 x 12 cm), covered with lids, containing ASTM (ASTM, 1980) medium (pH 7.6 \u00b1 0.3), at 20\u00baC, \n\nin a controlled temperature (CT) room (16:8h light:dark cycle and 50% humidity). A commercially available \n\nsand-pebble mixture (grain sizes: 0-8 mm) was acid washed (pH 2), ashed (4h, 450\u00baC) and used as \n\nsediment. Cultures were maintained in a plastic aquarium contained a 2 cm layer of sediment with \n\ncontinuous and moderated aeration. The worms were fed with approximately 5mg/30 worms of Tetraphyll, \n\napplied 2 or 3 times a week. \n\n \n\nSpiking - Whole-sediment (sediment that have had minimal manipulation (US EPA, 2000)) used in the \n\nexperiments had the following characteristics: 4.9% sand, 74.4% clay and 20.7% silt; pH of pore water \n\n6.77; ammonia of pore water 3.04 mg/Kg; total carbon content 0.54%. Metal-spike solutions were \n\nprepared by dissolving the appropriate amount of metal salt ((CH3COO)2Pb.3H2O; supplied by Merck) in \n\n\n\n \n\n   35 \n\ndistilled water. These solutions were added immediately to the control dry sediment. Then, the sediment \n\nwas capped and rapidly shaken for 1 min. The spiked sediments equilibrated for a minimum of 48h, to \n\nallow the lead to adsorb or bind to the sediment particles. During this time, sediments were shaken every \n\nday during approximately 2 min. Contaminated water was replaced by ASTM medium before adding the \n\nworms. Nominal lead concentrations in the sediment were 0 (control of uncontaminated sediment), 15.0, \n\n30.0, 60.0, 80.0 and 150.0 mg/Kg.  Sediment was sampled for metal analysis at the start and termination \n\nof each test; the overlying water (ASTM medium) was sampled only at the end of the tests. \n\n \n\nExposure design \u2013 Two tests were performed: one short-term (10-day) and one long-term (28-day), both \n\nwith contaminated sediment and clean water. Exposures were conducted at \u00b1 20\u00baC, in a CT-room (16:8h \n\nlight:dark cycle and 50% humidity), in 100 mL plastic beakers, containing 35 g of whole sediment and 20 \n\nmL of ASTM, in a static system. Seven replicates per concentration were used, each with six young \n\nworms (about 1.5 cm), totalling 42 organisms per concentration, carefully introduced into the beakers with \n\nthe help of a plastic Pasteur pipette. Mortality/survival, size class/growth (size class 1: worm &lt;2cm; size \n\nclass 2: 2cm &lt;worm &lt;2.5cm; size class 3: worm > 2.5 cm), colour, activity and presence in sediment or \n\nwater were monitored, every 48h for the short-term test and every 5 days for the long-term test. For this \n\ntask, worms were removed from sediment and carefully observed and measured.  During the long-term \n\ntest, worms were fed once a week with 2.4 mg of Tetraphyll per pot; no food was added during the short-\n\nterm test. The survival worms were collected and dried at 40\u00baC, for about 24h. For water, sediment and \n\nwhole-body samples the Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP-OES) method was used (ICP-OES acc. to DIN \n\nEN ISO 11885; Limit of quantitation (LOQ): 0,010 mg/L for water and 0,1 mg/Kg for sediment and whole-\n\nbody). Biomass (dry weight of surviving organisms divided by the initial number of organisms, according \n\nto US EPA, 2000) was also calculated. The behaviour of the worms was tested and recorded using the \n\nMFB. For these tests, seven worms from each concentration (one per replicate) were used, during 2h \n\n(plus 30 min acclimation period), in chambers filled with 50% ASTM water and 50% whole-sediment. \n\nThree chambers were used as control, filled as the others and without worms. Chambers with on single \n\n\n\n \n\n   36 \n\nworm were connected to the MFB and settings were made for channel information, noise level (50mV) \n\nand threshold value (Gerhardt and Schmidt, 2002) to obtain response data for the analysis of signal \n\nfrequencies. \n\n  \n\nStatistical analysis - Linear regression analyses were carried out using Excel\u00ae software package \n\n(Microsoft, USA). For each tested concentration, selected behavioural signal frequencies (0 \u2013 1Hz and 1 \u2013 \n\n3 Hz) were plotted over time. Normality and homoscedasticity were tested using the Software Package \n\nSigmaStat for Windows, version 3.5. Original behavioural MFB data were arcsin transformed and the \n\noverall effect of lead concentrations on population behaviour was investigated using a Kruskal-Wallis one-\n\nway ANOVA on ranks (p<0.001), followed by a post hoc Dunn\u2019s test (p<0.05) to check for significant \n\ndifferences (Zar 1996). \n\n \n\nResults  \n\nShort-term Test \n\nSome study parameters, such as colour, activity after a small prod, and presence in sediment or \n\nin water, were monitored during the experiment. No changes in colour occurred on organisms exposed to \n\nany lead concentration. Regarding activity, worms were little active after being cut, but were always active \n\non the other test days. No avoidance occurred: despite the contaminated sediment, worms never escaped \n\nto the clean water.  \n\n\n\n \n\n   37 \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Total mortality (%) of L. variegatus after exposure to short-term and long-term tests. \n\n \n\nA positive connection between metal concentration and mortality (Figure 1) was observed: \n\nmortality of L. variegatus increased linearly (R2=0.949) with increasing lead exposure. Highest mortalities \n\nwere observed for the concentrations of 60.0, 80.0 and 150.0 mg/Kg (19.0, 28.6 and 31.0%, total \n\nmortality, respectively). Only one worm died in the control (2.4%), demonstrating that the holding facilities \n\nand handling techniques were acceptable for conducting such tests, as required by the viability criteria \n\n(mean survival for control should be 90%) (ASTM, 1990).  \n\n\n\n \n\n   38 \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Growth (size class) of worms (mean+STDEV) throughout short-term test. \n\n \n\nGrowth was the most affected test parameter. Only worms exposed to the lowest concentration \n\n(15.0 mg/Kg) were not affected; all the other tested concentrations had a strong influence on the growth \n\nof the organisms. Higher concentrations of lead corresponded to slower growth (Figure 2): a control \n\njuvenile reaches the adult length (about 3 cm) after 7 to 8 days, on average, but the higher the lead \n\nconcentration in sediment, more days are needed for juveniles to became adults. A good linear relation \n\nwas found between lead concentrations and L. variegatus growth (R2 = 0.938). Biomass data (Table I) \n\ncorroborated the results of mortality and growth: biomass value decreased with the increase of lead \n\nconcentration, because worms grew less and the mortalities were higher. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n   39 \n\nTable I \u2013 Bioaccumulation and biomass data for the short-term test. \n\nConcentrations \n\n(mg/Kg) \n\nBioaccumulation \n\n(mg/Kg) \n\nBiomass \n\n(mg) \n\nCTR &lt;0.1 0.273 \n\n15.0 94.0 0.193 \n\n30.0 158.0 0.182 \n\n60.0 685.0 0.148 \n\n80.0 2590.0 0.141 \n\n150.0 3490.0 0.114 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.

During the short-term test (Figure 3) a decrease of behaviour (both locomotion and \n\nperistaltic movements) was observed for all tested days, strongly linked with the increase of lead \n\nconcentrations. Variances were not homogeneously distributed but the results of the one-way ANOVA on \n\nranks indicated a significant concentration effect (p<0.05), both for locomotion and peristaltic movements. \n\n \n\nSediment, Water and Whole-body Analysis \n\nLead concentrations in the initial and final sediment samples had values as expected (Table II), \n\nconfirming that the spiking method was correct and well performed. No important differences between \n\ninitial and final lead values were found. At the end of short-term test there was some lead in water \n\nsamples, probably due to collection of worms from the sediment for measurement and observation. Those \n\nconcentrations in water were, anyway, residual. Whole-body, as expected, presented high values of lead, \n\nat the end of the short-term test (Table I). Worms exposed to higher levels of lead in the sediment \n\npresented higher concentrations of metal in the whole-body, which shows an enormous capacity to \n\nabsorve and store this metal. The absorption of lead by the worms\u2019 whole-body increased as the \n\nexposure to metal increased (Figure 4), but not in a linear pattern: lead in whole-body followed a power \n\ntrend (R2 = 0.93). \n\n \n\nTable II \u2013 Lead concentration in sediment and water samples (mean \u00b1 STDEV), from short-term test.  \n\nConcentrations \n\n(mg/Kg) \n\nSediment Initial \n\nSamples \n\n(mg/Kg) \n\nSediment Final \n\nSamples \n\n(mg/Kg) \n\nWater Final \n\nSamples \n\n(mg/L) \n\nCTR 0.9 \u00b1 0.61 0.6 \u00b1 0.45 0.05 \u00b1 0.044 \n\n15.0 14.4 \u00b1 4.73 5.4 \u00b1 0.54 0.02 \u00b1 0.008 \n\n30.0 28.5 \u00b1 5.83 28.5 \u00b1 4.87 0.06 \u00b1 0.011 \n\n\n\n \n\n   41 \n\n60.0 63.7 \u00b1 8.82 75.4 \u00b1 10.82 0.22 \u00b1 0.038 \n\n80.0 71.0 \u00b1 10.50 101.2 \u00b1 7.56 0.24 \u00b1 0.066 \n\n150.0 149.1 \u00b1 12.13 141.6 \u00b111.53 0.41 \u00b1 0.492 \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.

After 28 days of exposure, high mortalities (Figure 1) were observed in worms \n\nexposed to 60.0 mg/Kg (52.4%) and 150.0 mg/Kg (59.5%) and also to 80.0 mg/Kg (38.1%). No mortality \n\noccurred on control demonstrating that the holding facilities and handling techniques were acceptable for \n\nconducting such tests. There was a clear positive linear relation (R2 = 0.92) between mortality and Pb \n\nconcentrations: higher mortalities were observed in worms exposed to higher Pb concentrations.  \n\n\n\n \n\n   42 \n\n \n\nFigure 5. Growth (size class) of worms (mean+STDEV) throughout long-term test. \n\n \n\nOnly worms exposed to 15.0 mg/Kg grew as CRT worms (Figure 5), all the other concentrations \n\ninhibited the growth of L. variegatus. Worms exposed to 150.0 mg/Kg (highest tested concentration) \n\nalmost did not grow. A linear relation between lead exposure and growth was found in the long-term test, \n\nbut the regression was not so strong (R2 = 0.82) as it was for the short-term test. Yet still, it is clear that \n\nthe growth of the worms was inhibited by the exposure to lead concentrations. Comparing long and short-\n\nterm tests, the results for growth are different: control worms grew more in the long-term test than in the \n\nshort-term-test, as expected. As observed for short-term test, biomass data (Table III) corroborated the \n\nresults of mortality and growth: biomass value decreased with the increase of lead concentration, \n\nbecause worms grew less and mortalities were higher.  \n\nReproduction was not one of the study endpoints, but was anyway observed during the long-\n\nterm test. Reproduction occurred for control (16.6% of the worms reproduced), 15.0 mg/Kg (7.1%) and \n\n30.0 mg/Kg (4.8%), and was clearly higher for control worms. This indicates that exposure to higher \n\nconcentration of lead also inhibited the reproduction of L. variegatus.  \n\n\n\n \n\n   43 \n\n \n\nTable III \u2013 Bioaccumulation and biomass data for the long-term test.  \n\nConcentrations \n\n(mg/Kg) \n\nBioaccumulation \n\n(mg/Kg) \n\nBiomass \n\n(mg) \n\nCTR &lt;0.1 0.401 \n\n15.0 53.7 0.383 \n\n30.0 165.0 0.166 \n\n60.0 296.0 0.133 \n\n80.0 496.0 0.178 \n\n150.0 1015.0 0.134 \n\n \n\nDuring the long-term test (figure 6), a decrease of both peristaltic movements and locomotion \n\nassociated with the increase of lead concentrations was observed. This trend was observed for all tested \n\ndays. On day 21, low activity values were measured for control worms. This was possibly due to the fact \n\nthat some worms were reproducing, which causes a decrease in the movements, affecting activity. On \n\nday 27 control worms presented high activity values. Again, variances were not homogeneously \n\ndistributed but the results of the one-way ANOVA on ranks indicated a significant concentration effect \n\n(p<0.05), both for locomotion and peristaltic movements. \n\n\n\n \n\n   44 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.

A variety of human activities, such as mining industries, and various \n\nby-products, such as motor car exhaust fumes and fertilizers, are responsible for releasing heavy metals \n\ninto the environment (Loumbourdis, 1997). Some populations are able to survive in the presence of high \n\nmetal concentrations, because they possess efficient detoxification mechanisms, or can lower the amount \n\nof metal accumulated in their bodies either through excretion (Gerhardt, 1993).   Populations that live for \n\ngenerations in contaminated environments can also develop a genetic resistance to metals (Gerhardt, \n\n1993), thus the importance of the study of sublethal effects and new endpoint such as behaviour. \n\nFor mortality, a linear trend was observed in both tests, short-term and long-term, which means \n\n\n\n \n\n   46 \n\nthat on short and long-term exposures to the metal lead, mortality linearly increases with the increase of \n\nexposure concentrations. Total mortality was higher at the end of the long-term test than at the end of the \n\nshort-term test, indicating that mortality increased over time, as expected.  \n\nComparisons of our data with other published studies is rather difficult, especially because of \n\nthe lack of works using behaviour as an endpoint and oligochaetes as test species. Maboeta et al. (1999) \n\nconcluded that growth of some oligochaetes (P. excavatus) was a sensitive endpoint for lead toxicity. \n\nGrowth of L. variegatus was particularly sensitive to lead and was affected by the exposure to \n\ncontaminated sediments. Lowest observed effect concentration for growth was 30.0 mg/Kg. Worms \n\nexposed to lead concentrations above 15.0 mg/Kg grew slowly than non-exposed worms; hence growth \n\nwas inhibited by exposure to lead-contaminated sediment. After the short-term test it was obvious that \n\ngrowth was inhibited but when the exposure was prolonged (long-term test), growth inhibition was clearly \n\nhigher. Nevertheless, long-term tests are more adjusted to confirm effects on growth and even \n\nreproduction. Short-term tests are very useful for identifying highly toxic chemicals but do not test key life \n\nstage events during which sensitivity to toxicants may be increased (Scarlett et al, 2007). The exposure to \n\nlead will affect the presence of this species in nature and its health, because of interference in growth \n\nprocess. Growth proved to be a sensitive endpoint to lead toxicity.  \n\nL. variegatus does not have a chitinous exoskeleton and can only accumulate toxics in soft \n\ntissues, simplifying the interpretation of the relationship between survival and body concentrations of toxic \n\nmaterials (Meyer et al, 2002). Considerably quantities of lead were found in the worms\u2019 whole-body. \n\nChloragogen cells of lumbricid worms (such as L. variegatus), which surround the gut and the large blood \n\nvessels, contain numerous granules named chloragosomes that are able, among other abilities, of bind \n\ntoxic cations and organic xenobiotcs, enabling the worms to survive mild poisonings (Fischer, 1977). It \n\nhas also been documented that chloragosomes are involved in the accumulation and immobilization of \n\nmetals (Ireland and Richards, 1977; Morgan and Morgan, 1989).  According to Aisember et al (2005), the \n\nlevels of lead concentration in L. variegatus and the levels of metal exposure showed strong positive \n\ncorrelations in 48h short-term tests, which could be described by highly significant linear regression \n\n\n\n \n\n   47 \n\nequations. This data is consistent with our results, which showed that worms exposed to higher \n\nconcentrations of lead presented a higher value of metal in the whole-body. The uptake of lead by L. \n\nvariegatus in the long-term test was linearly related to the nominal concentration of the metal in the \n\nexperiment, which implies that a steady state was not reached. Similar results were obtained by Mino et \n\nal (2006). When comparing biomass data from short-term and long-term tests (Figure 7), it was observed \n\nthat control and worms exposed to 15.0 mg/Kg presented much higher biomass after long-term exposure \n\nthen after short-term exposure. For all the other concentrations, short-term and long-term tests presented \n\nsimilar values of biomass and these results were consisting with mortality and growth data. \n\nFor behaviour, at the end of the short-term test only concentrations of 80.0 and 150.0 mg/Kg \n\nwere significant different (p<0.05) from control worms. But at the end of the long-term test behaviour of \n\nworms exposed to all concentrations above 30.0 mg/Kg was significant different (p<0.05) from control. In \n\ngeneral, exposures to lead concentrations above 30.0 mg/Kg resulted in a significant (p<0.05) decrease \n\nin activity. Locomotion and peristaltic movements were endpoints extremely sensitive to lead exposure: \n\nalong 28 days both behaviours were strongly inhibited. From the results of the MFB recordings, it is clear \n\nthat they cannot replace standard endpoint for short-term and long-term sediment toxicity tests, but the \n\ndata suggests that useful information can be obtained from recording the behaviour of L. variegatus in the \n\nMFB. Some studies already showed that behaviour can be a powerful tool when assessing metal \n\nexposure. O\u2019Gara et al (2004) observed that copper induces in locomotor behavior of L. variegatus. \n\nUntersteiner et al (2005) successfully used behaviour of Crustacea to access cadmium pollution.  \n\n\n\n \n\n   48 \n\n \n\nFigure 7. Biomass (mg) of worms exposed to short-term and long-term tests. \n\n \n\nThe adverse effects of lead exposure on the behavioural function noted in this study would be \n\nexpect to reduce the ability of L. variegatus to escape from predators, which may increase predation \n\ncompared to unexposed worms, and thus facilitate the transfer of metal lead from benthic oligochaetes to \n\norganisms occupying higher trophic levels. Although behaviour cannot replace standard toxicity \n\nendpoints, we suggest that it should be introduced as an additional parameter. It is a fast approach (faster \n\nthan mortality and growth) thus important in early warning systems and results can be obtained at \n\necological relevant concentrations (lower that lethal concentrations), which not always happen with \n\nmortality and growth. Behaviour integrates many cellular processes as is essential to the viability of the \n\norganism, population and community. Therefore, observations of behaviour provide a unique toxicological \n\nperspective: one that links the biochemical and ecological consequences of environmental contamination \n\n(Little, 1990). Because behaviour is important in activities such as predator avoidance, sexual interactions \n\nand feeding, an impact on behaviour leads to an impact on population dynamics. As hypothesised, \n\ndetecting early warning signals of exposed worms was possible, proving that behavioural parameters may \n\n\n\n \n\n   49 \n\nbe included in risk assessment protocols. \n\n \n\nConclusions \n\nExposure to lead affects the presence of L. variegatus in nature, because interferes in the \n\ngrowth process, indicating that growth is a sensitive endpoint for lead toxicity. Behaviour as a test \n\nparameters showed great potential and provided important data and we suggest that should be \n\nintroduced as a new parameter in toxicity tests. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to express their gratitude to Matti Lepp\u00e4nen and to Jussi \n\nKukkonen for providing us the worms for starting our culture.

Sensitive and suitable species can help understand and predict the impacts of such \n\npollutants. Automated sediment toxicity testing and biomonitoring has grown rapidly. Biomonitoring \n\ninstruments have been proven appropriate in the study of the effects of pollutants. A new approach in \n\nonline biomonitoring, using a Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor  (MFB), was developed in the present \n\nstudy using whole-sediment toxicity tests and behavioural responses of the freshwater oligochaete \n\nLumbriculus variegatus. Endpoints such as mortality and growth were used to study the effects of the \n\npesticide imidacloprid (family neonicotinoids) and to achieve a gradient of responses. Exposures to \n\ncontaminated sediments were performed during 10 days (short-term tests) and 28 days (long-term tests). \n\nHigh mortality was observed in the three highest concentrations of imidacloprid. An inhibition of behaviour \n\nwas observed along the gradient of the pesticide concentration. The exposure to imidacloprid-\n\ncontaminated sediments affected growth, behaviour and avoidance of L. variegatus. \n\n \n\nKey-words: Lumbriculus variegatus, imidacloprid, pesticide, Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor, \n\nbehaviour, ecotoxicology, sediment \n\n\n\n \n\n 58 \n\nIntroduction \n\nMortality, bioaccumulation, growth and reproduction have been the most common endpoints used in the \n\nvast majority of studies in environmental toxicology (Lepp\u00e4nen and Kukkonen, 1998). There is a lack of \n\ndata regarding sublethal toxicological endpoints, such as effects on growth, reproduction, morphology or \n\nbehaviour. Without this kind of information, the complex biological actions cannot be fully understood and \n\nreliable predictions of ecological impacts of environmental toxicants cannot be made (Rogge and Drewes, \n\n1993). During the last decades, there was an increasing interest in investigating sublethal endpoints \n\n(Aisemberg et al, 2005). Behaviour is probably an important path to search for mechanisms of toxicity \n\n(Macedo-Sousa et al, 2007). Once a behaviour can be quantified, it has the potential to be used as a \n\nbiomarker in the assessment of stress (Beitinger, 1990). Biomonitoring offers an appealing tool for the \n\nassessment of metal pollution in aquatic ecosystem (Zhou et al, 2008), and should rely on sublethal \n\nendpoints rather than mortality alone (Macedo-Sousa et al, 2007) \n\nAquatic species are important contributors to the functioning of lotic foodwebs (Benke and \n\nJacobi, 1994; Thorp and Delong, 2002), reason why they were chosen as test species in the present \n\nstudy. Oligochaete worms are key marcoinvertebrate constituents of terrestrial and freshwater \n\necosystems (Edwards and Lofty, 1977; Brinkhurst and Gelder, 1991). Locomotion and other behavioural \n\nactivities of these organisms are significant determinants of the physical, chemical, and biological \n\nproperties of soils and sediments. In addition, locomotor functions are the cornerstone of such vital \n\nfunctions as foraging, sexual reproduction, predator avoidance, dispersal, and general orientation to \n\nenvironmental cues (Drewes, 1997). Aquatic oligochaetes have an extremely long history of use in \n\npollution assessments (Chapman, 2001). Lumbriculus variegatus (M\u00fcller 1774) is recommended for use \n\nin toxicity tests with sediments based on ease of culture and handling, known chemical exposure history, \n\nadequate tissue mass for chemical analysis, tolerance to a wide range of sediment physical-chemical \n\ncharacteristics, low sensitivity to contaminants associated with sediment, and amenability to long-term \n\nexposures without feeding (Ingersoll et al, 2003). Judging by the number of internationally published \n\narticles, the most common oligochaete species used in evaluations of freshwater toxicity has been L. \n\n\n\n \n\n 59 \n\nvariegatus (Leppanen, 1999; Aisemberg et al, 2005). This species was proposed by the American Society \n\nof Testing and Materials (ASTM, 1995) as a standard organism for tests of sediment bioaccumulation and \n\nis listed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 1992) as a good \n\norganism for bioaccumulation studies. L. variegatus is a freshwater oligochaete known to have \n\nremarkable powers of segmental regeneration (Hyman, 1916). Reproduction under laboratory conditions \n\nis always by asexual fragmentation, during which a worm spontaneously divides into two or more body \n\nfragments. Each surviving fragment then undergoes rapid regeneration of body segments to form a new \n\nhead, tail, or both ends (Lesiuk and Drewes, 1999).  \n\nAll pesticides found on the market have been evaluated by sets of standardized protocols (the \n\nso-called a priori evaluation). One of the aims of these standardized tests is to evaluate the negative \n\neffects of pesticides on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Since the direct impact on ecosystems is \n\ndifficult to study, these tests are based on detrimental effects observed upon a set of model organisms, \n\nwhich play key roles in ecosystem structure and function. However, although the European Comission \n\n(EC) encouraged development of tests determining sublethal effects on model organisms, most of these \n\nprotocols focused on mortality (Capowiez et al, 2005). The EC recognized the importance of sublethal \n\ntests for earthworms in particular when the active substance is potentially persistent or multi-applied (EC \n\n2003). Imidacloprid [1-(6-chloro-3-pyridylmethyl)-2nitroimino-imidazolidine] is a relatively new systemic \n\ninsecticide (product names: AdmireTM, Confidor\u00ae, Gaucho\u00ae and Provado\u00ae). It was the first member of a \n\nnew family called neonicotinoids and is chemically related to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) \n\nagonists nicotine and epibatidine (Matsuda et al, 2001). It acts as an agonist of acetylcholine (Bai et al., \n\n1991) and is therefore effective against many insects currently resistant to carbamates, \n\norganophosphates, and pyrethroids. It was first introduced to the UK in 1998, and is now marketed in \n\nmore than 120 countries to protect more than 140 crops (Simms et al, 2006). It is widely used in \n\nagriculture for controlling sucking insects, as a seed dressing, for soil treatment, and as a foliar treatment \n\nin a variety of crops and orchards. It is also used for controlling cockroaches and termites and is found in \n\nmany domestic products used for pets and gardens (Cox, 2001). Some studies have shown that \n\n\n\n \n\n 60 \n\nimidacloprid can induce behaviour modifications in parasitoid hymenoptera (Stapel et al, 2000) and \n\ntermites (Thorne and Breisch, 2001) (namely foraging and burrowing activity, respectively). Effects of \n\nimidacloprid on earthworms have not been yet extensively studied (Capowiez and Berard, 2006). Luo et \n\nal (1999) and Zang et al (2000) found sperm deformities in Eisenia fetida at imidacloprid concentrations \n\nas low as 0.5 mg/kg of dry soil. More recently, Mostert et al (2000, 2002) showed that the LC50 for worms \n\nof the Pheretima group was 3 mg/kg of dry soil and no effect was observed on earthworm weight at 0.66 \n\nmg/kg of dry soil. Finally, Lal et al (2001) observed a decrease in the production of earthworm casts over \n\n120 days in field conditions. Capowiez et al (2003) realized that the behaviour of earthworms was \n\nsignificantly altered (decrease in burrow length, rate of burrow reuse, and distance covered) for \n\nconcentrations of imidacloprid between 0.5 and 1 mg/kg of dry soil.  \n\nImidacloprid has been found in streams and rivers and is likely to be bioavailable to aquatic \n\norganisms.  Because there were few studies on the toxicity of imidacloprid to relevant lotic species \n\n(Alexander et al, 2007), here we investigated the impact of imidacloprid on the behaviour of the aquatic \n\noligochaete L. variegatus. In this study, a new automated sediment toxicity test using L. variegatus was \n\ndeveloped to assess differences between short-term and long-term exposures to different concentrations \n\nof the pesticide. In addition, this study was an attempt to investigate the use of the behaviour of L. \n\nvariegatus as a tool to assess sublethal effects of a toxic substance. Our hypothesis was that the \n\nexposure to the pesticide would cause behavioural early warning responses, particularly on locomotion \n\nand peristaltic movements. \n\n \n\nMaterial and Methods \n\nCulture - Laboratory cultures of Lumbriculus variegatus (M\u00fcller 1774) used throughout these tests \n\noriginated from the University of Joensuu, Finland.  Animals were reared in a PE (Polyethylene) aquarium \n\n(8.5 x 17.5 x 12 cm), covered with lids, containing ASTM (ASTM, 1980) medium (pH 7.6 \u00b1 0.3), at 20\u00baC, \n\nin a controlled temperature (CT) room (16:8h light:dark cycle and 50% humidity). A commercially available \n\nsand-pebble mixture (grain sizes: 0-8 mm) was acid washed (pH 2), ashed (4h, 450\u00baC) and used as \n\n\n\n \n\n 61 \n\nsediment. Aquariums contained a 2 cm layer of sediment with continuous and moderated aeration. The \n\nworms were fed with approximately 5mg/30 worms of Tetraphyll, applied 2 or 3 times a week. \n\n \n\nSpiking - Whole-sediment (sediment and associated pore water that have had minimal manipulation (US \n\nEPA, 2000)) used in the experiments had the following characteristics: 4.9% sand, 74.4% clay and 20.7% \n\nsilt; pH of pore water 6.77; ammonia of pore water 3.04 mg/Kg; total carbon content 0.54%. Solutions \n\nwere prepared by dissolving the appropriate amount of imidacloprid (C9H10ClN5O2; supplied by Sigma \n\nAldrich) in distilled water. These solutions were added immediately. Then, the sediment was capped and \n\nrapidly shaken for 1 min. The spiked sediments equilibrated in the dark (due to the light sensitivity of the \n\npesticide) for a minimum of 48h, to allow the imidacloprid to adsorb to the sediment particles. During this \n\ntime, sediments were shaken every day during approximately 2 min. Contaminated water was replaced \n\nby ASTM water before adding the worms. Nominal imidacloprid concentrations in the sediment were 0 \n\n(control of uncontaminated sediment), 0.05, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 mg/Kg. Sediment was sampled for \n\nimidacloprid analysis at the start and termination of each test; the overlying medium (ASTM) was sampled \n\nonly at the end of tests. \n\n \n\nExposure design \u2013 Two tests were performed: one short-term (10-day) and one long-term (28-day), both \n\nwith contaminated sediment and clean water. Exposures were conducted at \u00b1 20\u00baC, in a CT-room (16:8h \n\nlight:dark cycle and 50% humidity), in 100 mL plastic beakers, containing 35 g of whole sediment and 20 \n\nmL of ASTM, in a static system. Seven replicates per concentration were used, each with six young \n\nworms (about 1.5 cm), totalling 42 organisms per concentration, carefully introduced into the beakers with \n\nthe help of a plastic Pasteur pipette. Mortality, growth (size class 1: worm &lt;2cm; size class 2: 2cm, &lt;\n\nworm &lt;2.5cm; size class 3: worm > 2.5 cm), colour and presence in sediment or water were monitored, \n\nevery 48h for the short-term test and every 5 days for the long-term test. For the monitoring, worms were \n\nremoved from test beakers and carefully observed and measured.  Sediments were replaced by newly \n\nspiked ones every 5 days, for both tests. During the long-term test, worms were fed once a week with 2.4 \n\n\n\n \n\n 62 \n\nmg of Tetraphyll per beaker; no food was added during the short-term test. The surviving worms were \n\ncollected and dried at 40\u00baC, for about 24h and then weighed. Before drying, worms were rinsed rapidly in \n\ndistilled water and gently dried with filter paper. There was no attempt to remove sediment from L. \n\nvariegatus intestines, by allowing a depuration period (putting the worms in water for 24h), because an \n\nincrease in the water content of worms could decrease or erase negative effects on weight (Dalby et al. \n\n1996, Capowiez et al. 2005). Imidacloprid in water, sediment and whole-body samples was analysed, \n\nafter extraction with acetonitrile by HPLC-UV at 270 nm (Limit of quantitation (LOQ): 0.1 \u00b5g/L for water, \n\n0.001 mg/Kg for sediment and 0.01 mg/Kg for whole-body). Prior to analysis sediment, water and whole-\n\nbody samples were kept in the dark. Biomass (dry weight of surviving organisms divided by the initial \n\nnumber of organisms, according to US EPA, 2000) was also calculated. \n\n \n\nMultispecies Freshwater Biomonitor - The Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor\u00ae (MFB), suitable for both \n\ninvertebrates and vertebrates, measures online different behaviours of aquatic species and it is based on \n\nthe registration of changes in a high frequency alternating current, that is caused by movements of the \n\norganisms in their test chambers (Gerhardt et al., 1994; Gerhardt, 2000). The individual test organism is \n\nplaced in a flow-through cylindrical test chamber with two pairs of stainless steel-plate electrodes, \n\nattached at the opposite chamber walls (Figure 1). A high-frequency alternating current signal (100kHz) is \n\nsent by one electrode pair across the chamber, while the second pair (not current carrying) detects \n\nchanges in impedance \u2013 the electrical field change due to organisms\u2019 movements.  \n\n\n\n \n\n 63 \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Constituents of the experiment (chambers, measuring instrument and lpatop computer). \n\n(adapted from Macedo-Sousa et al., 2007). \n\n \n\nDifferent types of behaviour (movements) generate characteristical electrical signals (Gerhardt, 1999, \n\n2000), that can be characterized by their amplitude and frequency. Using L. variegatus two different \n\nmovements can be measured: peristaltic movements (band 1: 0.5 \u2013 1 Hz) and locomotion (band 2: 1 \u2013 3 \n\nHz). The electrical signals are then processed by a discrete Fast Fourier Transformation and generate a \n\nhistogram of the occurrence of all frequencies in % (summarized in intervals of O.S Hz from 0 to 10 Hz), \n\nhence yielding a \u201dfingerprint\u201d of the behavioural pattern of the organism. This transformation gives the \n\npercentage of occurrence of each single frequency during each record period. Records occur over a 4 \n\nmin period, with an interval of 6 min between records. This method has already shown to be a valuable \n\nbiomonitoring and toxicity testing tool using epi-benthic crustaceans, insects, as well as planktonic and \n\npelagic species of fish and tadpoles (Gerhardt, 2000). Behavioural responses may have a role in \n\nsearching mechanisms of toxicity and the MFB, as a sophisticated device, may help to explore those \n\nmechanisms (Gerhardt et al 2005). The behaviour of the worms was tested and recorded using the MFB. \n\nFor these tests, seven worms  from each concentration (one per replicate) were used and behaviour was \n\nrecord during 2h (plus 30 min acclimation period). Chambers (1cm diameter, 4 cm length) were filled with \n\n\n\n \n\n 64 \n\n50% ASTM water and 50% whole-sediment and three chambers were used as control, filled as the others \n\nand without worms. Chambers with one single worm were connected to the MFB and settings were made \n\nfor channel information, noise level (50 mV) and threshold value (Gerhardt and Schmidt, 2002) to obtain \n\nresponse data for the analysis of signal frequencies.  \n\n \n\nStatistical analysis - Linear regression analyses were carried out using Excel software package \n\n(Microsoft, USA). For each tested concentration, selected behavioural signal frequencies (0 \u2013 1Hz and 1 \u2013 \n\n3 Hz), were plotted over time. Normality and homoscedasticity were tested using the Software Package \n\nSigmaStat for Windows, version 3.5. Original behavioural MFB data were arcsin transformed and the \n\noverall effect of imidacloprid concentrations on population behaviour was investigated using a Kruskal-\n\nWallis one-way ANOVA on ranks (p<0.001), followed by a post hoc Dunn\u2019s test (p<0.05) to check for \n\nsignificant differences (Zar 1996). \n\n \n\nResults  \n\nShort-term Test  \n\nColour of worms showed no change when exposed to imidacloprid: colour was always normal \n\n(reddish brown). Avoidance was measured by counting the number of worms that were not in the \n\nsediment. As seen in Figure 2, L. variegatus clearly avoided contaminated sediments and the avoidance \n\nwas higher (100%) on sediments contaminated with higher concentrations of the pesticide. For worms \n\nexposed to 0.05 and 0.5 mg/Kg, avoidance increased along the test days. \n\n\n\n \n\n 65 \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Percentage of individuals in water (mean+STDEV) throughout the short-term test. \n\n \n\nMortality (Figure 3) on control was very low (2%), demonstrating that the holding facilities and \n\nhandling techniques were acceptable for conducting such tests, as required in the standard protocol \n\nwhere mean survival for control should be 90% (ASTM, 1990). After 10 days of exposure, high mortalities \n\nwere observed in worms exposed to 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 mg/Kg. There was a clear positive relation between \n\nmortality and imidacloprid concentrations: higher mortalities were observed in worms exposed to higher \n\npesticide concentrations. A power trendline  (R2 = 0.838) shows that mortality increased at a specific rate. \n\nAll tested concentrations induced a growth inhibition: in fact, worms exposed to higher concentrations (2.5 \n\nand 5.0 mg/Kg) did not grow at all. After the short-term test, it was clear that the growth of the worms was \n\ninhibited by the exposure to sediments contaminated with imidacloprid (Figure 4). All tested \n\nconcentrations clearly inhibited the worm\u2019s growth and a linear correlation was found between pesticide \n\nconcentrations and L. variegatus growth (R2 = 0.84). Biomass is, according to USEPA (2000), the dry \n\nweight of surviving organisms divided by the initial number of organisms. Biomass data (Table I) \n\ncorroborated the results of mortality and growth. As expected, biomass decreased with increasing \n\n\n\n \n\n 66 \n\nimidacloprid concentrations, because mortality was higher and growth was lower. The exponential \n\ntrendline (Figure 4) also shows that biomass values decreased at increasingly higher rates of \n\nimidacloprid. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.

Despite not being one of the endpoint in evaluation, reproduction was \n\nobserved during the long-term test, but only on control worms by the 20th day of exposure. Worms \n\nexposed to any of the used imidacloprid concentrations did not reproduce, which indicates that exposure \n\nto this pesticide inhibits L. variegatus reproduction. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.

There was a clear positive logarithmic relation (R2 = 0.86) between \n\nmortality and imidacloprid concentrations: the rate of change in the data increases quickly and then levels \n\nout. All concentrations inhibited the growth of L. variegatus (Figure 9). Only specimens from the lowest \n\nimidacloprid level (0.05 mg/Kg) grew, although less than in the control. As observed for the short-term \n\ntest, biomass data (Table III) corroborated the results of mortality and growth: biomass value decreased \n\nwith the increase of lead concentration, because worms grew less and mortalities were higher.  \n\n\n\n \n\n 72 \n\n \n\nFigure 9.

Although both behaviours were affected, after day 15 it was clear that \n\nlocomotion was much more inhibited than peristaltic movements, which means that although worms \n\npresent some activity their locomotion was strongly reduced. Locomotion has been found to be a \n\nconsistently sensitive measure of toxic stress for a wide range of environmental contamination (Little and \n\nFinger, 1990).  \n\nVariances were not homogeneously distributed but the results of the one-way ANOVA on ranks \n\nindicated in general a significant concentration effect (p<0.05), for both locomotion and peristaltic \n\nmovements. \n\n \n\nFigure 10.

Concentrations of the \n\npesticide in the initial sediment samples presented values close to the nominal concentrations, but final \n\nsamples had low imidacloprid concentrations.  Although an effort was made to renew contaminated \n\nsediments to maintain the toxic concentration, the fast degradation of the pesticide made it not possible. \n\nWater samples collected at the end of the 28 days test presented very low values of imidacloprid. Due to \n\nlow survival and very high mortalities (100%), analysis of imidacloprid present in worm\u2019s whole-body are \n\nnot of relevance.  \n\n \n\nTable IV \u2013 Imidacloprid concentration in sediment and water samples (mean \u00b1 STDEV), from long-term \n\ntest.

The survival \n\n\n\n \n\n 75 \n\nprobability of organisms that are able to stay alive the first days after a pesticide application increases as \n\nthe environmental concentration of the pesticide decreases with time due to biodegradation (Laskowsky, \n\n2001). The design of our tests did not account for this situation, since several renewals of contaminated \n\nsediment were performed. \n\nMortality showed different trends for short and long-term tests. For short-term tests, mortality \n\nincreased at a specific rate, following a power trendline. A logarithmic trendline was observed for long-\n\nterm tests: the rate of change increases quickly and then levels out. This indicates, as expected, that \n\nresults for short-term tests represent just the initial response of the organisms to the toxic exposure.  Total \n\nmortality was higher at the end of the long-term test than at the end of short-term test, which means that \n\nmortality increased over time, as expected. Growth of L. variegatus was particularly affected by the \n\nexposure to contaminated sediments.  \n\nThe lowest observed effect concentration of imidacloprid for growth was 0.05 mg/Kg: exposed \n\nworms grew slower than non-exposed worms. Hence, growth was inhibited by exposure to imidacloprid-\n\ncontaminated sediments, in both short and long-term tests. Nevertheless, as expected, long-term tests \n\nare more appropriate to confirm effects on growth and reproduction. Acute (short-term) tests are very \n\nuseful for identifying highly toxic chemicals but do not test key life stage events during which sensitivity to \n\ntoxicants may be increased (Scarlett et al, 2007). Because L. variegatus does not have a chitinous \n\nexoskeleton it can only accumulate toxics in soft tissues, simplifying the interpretation of the relationship \n\nbetween survival and body concentrations of toxic materials (Meyer et al, 2002). Considerable quantities \n\nof imidacloprid were found in the worm\u2019s whole-body tissues. Chloragogen cells of lumbricid worms (such \n\nas L. variegatus), which surround the gut and the large blood vessels, contain numerous granules named \n\nchloragosomes that are able of binding toxic cations and organic xenobiotcs, enabling the worms to \n\nsurvive mild poisoning (Fischer, 1977). Contaminants may accumulate from ingested sediment particles \n\nby desorption followed by absorption across the gut wall in the presence of digestive fluids (Weston et al. \n\n2000), which can explain the high values of imidacloprid present in the whole-body tissues. \n\nUsing acute mortality estimates alone it is not possible to predict how a population\u2019s growth rate \n\n\n\n \n\n 76 \n\nwill respond or change, hence the assessment of a xenobiotic based solely on acute mortality estimates \n\nwould lead to flawed conclusions about a population\u2019s exposure response (Walthall and Stark, 1997). \n\nAcute lethal concentration estimates are a poor estimator of population level endpoints such as the \n\npopulation growth rate. This may be due to the ability of surviving individuals, of species\u2019 with high \n\nreproductive rates, to act as \u2018\u2018reservoirs\u2019\u2019 and compensate for lost individuals following toxicant exposure. \n\nThus, application of the population growth rate as a measure of sublethal effects is more relevant and \n\npredictive than lethal concentration estimates when determining the potential impact of a xenobiotic on a \n\npopulation (Walthall and Stark, 1997). \n\nAs hypothesised, detecting early warming signals of exposed worms was possible, proving that \n\nbehavioural parameters may be included in risk assessment protocols. These experiments showed that \n\nimidacloprid significantly changed the behaviour of L. variegatus, in terms of both locomotion and \n\nperistaltic movements, confirming the findings of Alexander et al (2007). The reduction in oligochaete \n\nmovement could increase predation risk by limiting the ability to avoid capture (Drewes, 1997). Previous \n\nexperiments using earthworms showed that imidacloprid can also change the burrowing behaviour for \n\nconcentrations between 0.5 and 1 mg/kg (Capowiez et al. 2003). In another experiment, Capowiez et al. \n\n(2006) observed that several aspects of the earthworm behaviour (distance travelled, oscillations) or of \n\nthe resulting burrow systems (area, topology, sinuosity and depth) were affected by imidacloprid \n\nconcentrations. The high water solubility and low Koc of this chemical indicate a low tendency to be \n\nadsorbed to soil particles.  Field studies show that imidacloprid can persist in soil, with a half-life ranging \n\nfrom 27 to 229 days (Miles Inc., 1993). In laboratory studies, imidacloprid has a half-life greater than one \n\nyear in oxygenated sand loam soil (US EPA, 1994). It is not easy to homogeneously spike sediments with \n\na contaminant. Bearing this in mind, the effectiveness of our spiking protocol appears satisfactory. \n\nDecrease in biomass seems to be a sensitive endpoint, since it was possible to detect \n\ndecreases in biomass even at low concentrations of imidacloprid. Capowiez et al (2005) observed that \n\nweight loss of earthworms was a sensitive biomarker for exposure to imidacloprid even for low \n\nconcentrations (0.5 mg/Kg dry soil). To explain weight decrease, these authors proposed different but not \n\n\n\n \n\n 77 \n\nexclusive factors: (1) inactivity, as a direct response to the insecticide or as a mechanism of avoidance, or \n\n(2) physiological causes such as less efficient assimilation or development of a costly mechanism of \n\ndetoxification. We believe that these two factors may also be the responsibles for the biomass decrease \n\nobserved in the present study. \n\nAn interesting observation was that both on short and long-term tests all worms exposed to \n\nconcentrations above 0.05 mg/Kg that survived were found together in one single aggregate. This seems \n\nto be also a result of the exposure to imidacloprid and raises many questions. Is it a defence mechanism? \n\nWill it help the worms survive longer? Further investigation is needed to address these questions. \n\nOligochaetes feed on subsurface sediments and egest onto the sediment surface, hence \n\nrecycling deposited material. In high worm densities, reworking can considerably modify the structure of \n\nsediments (Krezoski &amp; Robbins, 1985; McCall &amp; Fisher, 1980). Thus, when imidacloprid presence affects \n\nthe survival, growth and behaviour of L. variegatus it is also affecting the balance of the ecosystem. As it \n\nis likely that behaviour inhibition could have a severe effect on oligochaete performance in the \n\nenvironment, this endpoint is important to evaluate the impacts of pollutants and pesticides on sediment \n\necosystems. Although behaviour cannot replace standard toxicity endpoints, we suggest that it should be \n\nintroduced as an additional parameter. It is a fast approach (faster than mortality and growth) thus \n\nimportant in early warning systems and results can be obtained at ecological relevant concentrations \n\n(lower that lethal concentrations), which not always happen with mortality and growth. Behaviour \n\nintegrates many cellular processes as is essential to the viability of the organism, population and \n\ncommunity. Therefore, observations of behaviour provide a unique toxicological perspective: one that \n\nlinks the biochemical and ecological consequences of environmental contamination (Little, 1990). \n\nBecause behaviour is important in activities such as predator avoidance, sexual interactions and feeding, \n\nan impact on behaviour leads to an impact on population dynamics.  \n\n \n\nConclusions \n\nThe pesticide imidacloprid proved to affect the presence of L. variegatus, because reduces \n\n\n\n \n\n 78 \n\nsurvival, inhibits behaviour, interferes in the growth process and can shorten the lifespan of the species. \n\nGrowth and avoidance proved to be sensitive sublethal endpoints to imidacloprid contamination. \n\nBehaviour tests should be conducted in addition to classical sediment tests. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to express their gratitude to Matti Lepp\u00e4nen and to Jussi \n\nKukkonen for providing us the worms for starting our culture.

To \n\nevaluate the toxicity of several sediments from an abandoned cupric pyrite mine, the aquatic \n\noligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus was used as a test organism and behaviour was one of the \n\nendpoints. L. variegatus is a freshwater oligochaete, largely used in toxicity tests and presents a \n\nremarkable ability to regenerate. Behavioural stress responses were monitored online with the \n\nMultispecies Freshwater Biomonitor (MFB). Metal and metalloid pollution at a disused pyrite mine \n\nwere investigated by considering five sediment samples as representatives of the different pH \n\nvalues of the area. Five sediments were collected at S\u00e3o Domingos Mine, their characteristics \n\nanalysed and ecotoxicological tests were performed. Survival, growth, avoidance, as well as \n\nbehaviour were monitored. Results showed poor sediment quality in most of the collected \n\nsediments. High mortalities were observed in this study, ranging from 100% to 32.6%, which \n\nindicates severe contamination. Our data demonstrated that collected sediments did not support \n\ngood L. variegatus growth and significantly changed and reduced the behaviour of L. variegatus, \n\nin terms of both locomotion and peristaltic movements. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Lumbriculus variegatus, Mine, Metals, sediment, Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor, \n\nbehaviour, acid mine drainage, online biomonitor  \n\n\n\n 88 \n\nIntroduction \n\nMetal polluted sites represent a potentially hazardous risk for human health and the \n\nenvironment (Martin\u00e9z-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2007). Abandoned mines can be responsible for several \n\nimpacts in their surrounding environment due to the chemical nature of their effluents (Boult et al., \n\n1994). The dissolution of metals from the sulphide ores in contact with oxygen can cause acid \n\nmine runoffs, even after mining activity has ceased, with consequent release of acid mine \n\ndrainage (AMD) (Kelly, 1991). AMD is known to cause major environmental problems in river and \n\nfloodplain water and sediment quality (Lottermoser, 2003). S\u00e3o Domingos Mine (Portugal) \n\nsediments are severely contaminated with metals (MINEO, 2003) but the extension of such \n\ncontamination has not been investigated. One of the major challenges in assessing the ecological \n\nrisk associated with exposure to contaminated sediments is the presence of chemical mixtures. \n\nField-collected sediments, as a rule, contain complex mixtures of chemicals and other factors that \n\ninfluence toxic response (US EPA, 2005). A critical factor for sediment toxicity is contaminant\u2019s \n\nbioavailability \u2013 the degree to which contaminants can be taken up by plants and animals (Ankley \n\net al., 1996). Sediment parameters that affect metal bioavailability include cation exchange \n\ncapacity, total organic carbon (TOC), iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) oxides and acide volatile \n\nsulfides (AVS) (Bentivegna et al., 2004). \n\nBiomonitoring should rely on sublethal endpoints rather than mortality alone (Macedo-\n\nSousa et al., 2007). Biomonitoring instruments have been proven to have the best deterrent effect \n\nupon pollutants (Gerhardt, 2000) addressing the need to determine the effects of pollutants on \n\nbenthic invertebrates (Macedo-Sousa et al., 2007). Behavioural changes may have ecological \n\nconsequences, e.g. avoidance behaviour or decreased activity may influence population levels by \n\naffecting migration or susceptibility to predation (Gerhardt, 1995). Behaviour is probably an \n\nimportant path to search for mechanisms of toxicity (Macedo-Sousa et al., 2007) and behavioural \n\nendpoints are more sensitive than mortality tests (Gerhardt, 1995), reflecting different levels of \n\nsusceptibly of organisms to environmental stimuli and are, therefore, appropriate indicators for \n\nbiomonitoring purposes (Gerhardt et al., 1994; Ulfstrand, 1996). Once a determined behaviour \n\ncan be quantified, it has the potential to be used as a biomarker in the assessment of stress \n\n\n\n 89 \n\n(Beitinger, 1990). Online biomonitoring represents a continuous and automated biotest, that \n\nstrives for detect early warming signals from specimens when those react to the stress of being \n\nexposed to a toxic. The assumption is that behaviour of organisms will change rapidly and \n\nsensitively because of the presence of toxic substances. Furthermore, the detection of early \n\nwarning signals is ecologically more relevant, faster, and cheaper than chemical detection of a \n\nselection of chemicals (Gerhardt, 1999). \n\nOligochaete worms are key marcoinvertebrate constituents of terrestrial and freshwater \n\necosystems (Edwards and Lofty, 1977; Brinkhurst and Gelder, 1991). Their locomotor and other \n\nbehavioural activities are significant determinants of the physical, chemical and biological \n\nproperties of soils and sediments (Drewes, 1997). Testing sediments for toxicity generally relies \n\non the use of test organisms (Bentivegna et al., 2004) and aquatic oligochaetes have an \n\nextremely long history of use for pollution assessments (Chapman, 2001).  Lumbriculus \n\nvariegatus (M\u00fcller 1774) is recommended for use in toxicity tests with sediments based on ease \n\nof culture and handling, known chemical exposure history, adequate tissues mass for chemical \n\nanalysis, tolerance of a wide range of sediment physical-chemical characteristics, low sensitivity \n\n(in terms of mortality) to contaminants associated with sediment, and amenability to long-term \n\nexposures without feeding (Ingersoll et al., 2003). This species has been proposed by the \n\nAmerican Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM, 1995) as a standard organism for tests of \n\nsediment bioaccumulation and is listed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and \n\nDevelopment (OECD, 1992) as a good organism for bioaccumulation studies. L. variegatus is a \n\nfreshwater oligochaete known to have remarkable powers of segmental regeneration (Hyman, \n\n1916). Reproduction under laboratory conditions is always by asexual fragmentation, during \n\nwhich a worm spontaneously divides into two or more body fragments (Lesiuk and Drewes, \n\n1999). \n\nIn this research work, the Multispecies Freshwater BiomonitorTM (MFB) was used to \n\ndevelop a new approach for online biomonitoring. This new approach combined behavioural and \n\nstandard toxicity parameters, such as mortality and growth of L. variegatus. Behaviour was \n\nchosen because its fast response time and sub-lethal sensitivity (Gerhardt, 1999). The main goal \n\n\n\n 90 \n\nof this work was to evaluate the toxicity of sediments from an abandoned cupric pyrite mine. We \n\nassessed sediment toxicity by measuring the 10-day mortality, growth and behaviour of L. \n\nvariegatus. Other tested parameters included TOC, AVS, grain size and metals in sediment and \n\nin whole-body. \n\n \n\nMaterials and Methods \n\nCulture - Laboratory cultures of L. variegatus used throughout these tests originated from the \n\nUniversity of Joensuu, Finland. Organisms reared in a PE (Polyethylene) aquarium (8.5 x 17.5 x \n\n12 cm), covered with lids, containing ASTM (ASTM, 1980) medium (pH 7.6 \u00b1 0.3), at 20\u00baC, in a \n\ncontrolled temperature (CT) room (16:8h light:dark cycle and 50% humidity). A commercially \n\navailable sand-pebble mixture (grain sizes: 0-8 mm) was acid washed (pH 2), ashed (4h, 450\u00baC) \n\nand used as sediment. Cultures were maintained in a plastic aquarium contained a 2 cm layer of \n\nsediment with continuous and moderated aeration. The worms were fed with approximately \n\n5mg/30 worms of Tetraphyll, applied 2 or 3 times a week. \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Location of S\u00e3o Domingos Mine (adapted from Pereira et al., 2004) \n\n\n\n 91 \n\n \n\nStudy site and sample collection - Located in southern Portugal [37 39\u2019 56\u2019\u2019 N, 7 28\u2019 46\u2019\u2019 W] \n\n(Pereira et al., 1999) within the Alentejo Province, the S\u00e3o Domingos mining area (Figure 1) is \n\nintegrated in the Iberian Pyrite Belt. The climate is semiarid and the mine has been abandoned \n\nfor more than 30 years. The ore body was formed by a unique vertical mass of cupriferous pyrite \n\nassociated to zinc and lead sulphide, hosted by the Volcanic Sedimentary Complex of \n\nTournaisian age (Oliveira, 1997). It contains ores of pyrite (Fe, S), chalcopyrite (Fe, S, Cu), \n\nsphalerite (Zn, S) and galena (Pb, S) (MINEO, 2003). The area has not been submitted to any \n\nremediation measures until now (MINEO, 2003). Over the years, shafts and retention basins were \n\nfilled with water and a continuous stream of AMD with a pH of 2.3 now flows down the main \n\nexcavated valley toward the Chan\u00e7a River. Along its course, the AMD receives a few tributaries \n\nwith pH 6 to 7, creating small mixing zones. By the time it reaches an artificial reservoir on the \n\nChan\u00e7a River, the water pH may have climbed to 5 in rainy periods. However, the pH may remain \n\nvery low in dry periods. At the confluence of the Mosteir\u00e3o stream (southern Portugal) with the \n\nAMD main channel, a dynamic pH gradient between 6.4 and 2.3 exists over less than 200 m (De \n\nBisthoven et al., 2004). The study area is situated at the confluence of the Mosteir\u00e3o stream with \n\nthe mine effluent. It represents an area with a natural pH and metal concentration gradient, where \n\nfive sites with different pH and associated metals were investigated (sed-A \u2013 pH=2.5, sed-B \u2013 \n\npH=3.5, sed-C \u2013 pH=4.5, sed-D \u2013 pH=5.5 and sed-E \u2013 pH=6.5; Figure 2). In addition, a pristine \n\nlocal reference site was taken on the River Vasc\u00e3o, flowing along the edge of the Parque Natural \n\nVale do Guadiana, south of the mining belt. The area is anthropogenically unaffected, but \n\nsituated in the same climatic ecoregion (Gerhardt et al, 2004). The following physical parameters \n\nwere recorded at each site before sediment collection: pH, dissolved oxygen (mg/L), conductivity \n\n(mS/cm) and temperature (\u00baC). Because of high variation within a single location, it is important to \n\ntake at least 3 to 5 subsite samples (Herr and Gray 1997). In this study, for each pH (each site), \n\nthree replicates were collected, each with approximately 3kg (Herr and Gray 1997). Sediment \n\nsamples were collected using plastic scoop (washed with 10% nitric acid and rinsed with distilled \n\nwater to avoid any contamination) at all sampling sites, from the top 30mm of the oxidized layer \n\n\n\n 92 \n\n(Herr and Gray 1997). Pre-sieving in the field through 2mm mesh using river water is a quick and \n\nefficient method of particle size separation, easing subsequent work in the laboratory (Herr and \n\nGray 1997). Pre-sieving was performed in site for all the samples and replicates. Samples were \n\nlabelled, placed in plastic containers and transported to the laboratory. In the laboratory, sediment \n\nfrom the three existing replicates was mixed and homogenised and then placed in plastic bags \n\nand frozen during 48 h, to prevent bacteria activity. Sediment was defrosted at room temperature \n\nprior to use. \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Sampling sites. \n\n \n\nExposure design \u2013 Short-term (10 days) tests were performed using contaminated sediment \n\ncollected at the Mine and clean ASTM medium (ASTM, 1980). Exposures were conducted at \u00b1 \n\n20\u00baC, in a CT-room (16:8h light:dark cycle and 50% humidity), in 100 mL plastic beakers, \n\ncontaining 2 cm of sediment and 20 mL of ASTM, in a static system. Seven replicates per site \n\nwere used, each with seven young worms (about 1.5 cm), totalling 49 organisms per \n\nconcentration, carefully introduced into the beakers with the help of a plastic Pasteur pipette.. \n\nMortality/survival, size class/growth (size class 1: worm &lt;2cm; size class 2: 2cm &lt;worm &lt;\n\n2.5cm; size class 3: worm > 2.5 cm), colour and avoidance were monitored and no food was \n\nadded during the test. The survival worms were collected and dried at 40\u00baC, for about 24h and \n\nthen weighed. Before drying, worms were rinsed rapidly in distilled water and gently dried with \n\n\n\n 93 \n\nfilter paper. There was no attempt to remove sediment from L. variegatus intestines, by allowing a \n\nrecovery period (putting the worms in water for 24h), because an increase in the water content of \n\nworms could decrease or erase negative effects on weight (Dalby et al. 1996, Capowiez et al. \n\n2005). For sediment and whole-body samples the Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP-OES) \n\nmethod was used (ICP-OES acc. to DIN EN ISO 11885; Limit of quantitation (LOQ) for sediment \n\nand whole-body samples (mg/Kg): Cadmium (Cd): 0.1; Copper (Cu): 0.5; Zinc (Zn): 0.1; \n\nManganese (Mn): 0.05; Lead (Pb): 0.5; Arsenic (As): 0.5; Iron (Fe): 0.1; Sulphur (S): 0.5. Biomass \n\n(dry weight of surviving organisms divided by the initial number of organisms, according to US \n\nEPA, 2000) was also calculated. Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were calculated for each metal \n\naccording to the formula [BAF = metal concentration (mg/kg dry wt.) in tissue / metal \n\nconcentration (mg/kg dry wt.) in sediment x 100%], according to Barron (1995). \n\n \n\nBehavioural responses - The MFB construction and functioning is described elsewhere (Gerhardt \n\net al., 1999; Gerhardt, 2000). Briefly, it measures online different behaviours of aquatic species \n\nand it is based on the registration of changes in a high frequency alternating current, that is \n\ncaused by movements of the organisms in their test chambers (Gerhardt et al., 1994; Gerhardt, \n\n2000). The individual test organism is placed in a flow-through cylindrical test chamber with two \n\npairs of stainless steel-plate electrodes, attached at the opposite chamber walls (Figure 3).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Constituents of the behavioural experiment (chambers, measuring instrument and \n\nlpatop computer). (adapted from Macedo-Sousa et al., 2007). \n\n\n\n 94 \n\nDifferent types of behaviour (movements) generate characteristical electrical signals (Gerhardt, \n\n1999, 2000), that can be characterized by their amplitude and frequency. For L. variegatus two \n\ndifferent movements can be measured: peristaltic movements (band 1: 0.5 \u2013 1 Hz) and \n\nlocomotion (band 2: 1 \u2013 3 Hz). The electrical signals are then processed by a discrete Fast \n\nFourier Transformation and generate a histogram of the occurrence of all frequencies in % \n\n(summarized in intervals of O.S Hz from 0 to 10 Hz), hence yielding a \u201dfingerprint\u201d of the \n\nbehavioural pattern of the organism. For these tests, seven worms  from each concentration (one \n\nper replicate) were used and behaviour was record during 2h (plus 30 min acclimation period). \n\nMeasurement were recorded for 4 min, every 10 min. Chambers (1cm diameter, 4 cm length) \n\nwere filled with 50% ASTM water and 50% sediment and three chambers were used as control, \n\nfilled as the others but without worms. Chambers with one single worm were connected to the \n\nMFB and settings were made for channel information, noise level (50 mV) and threshold value \n\n(Gerhardt and Schmidt, 2002) to obtain response data for the analysis of signal frequencies. \n\n \n\nStatistical analysis \u2013 The statistical relationship between some sediment parameters and \n\nL.variegatus mortality was determined by bivariate correlation using Pearson coefficient in a two-\n\ntailed test, p<0.05. These statistical analyses were performed using Minitab software (version \n\n14.1). For each tested sediment, selected behavioural signal frequencies (0 \u2013 1Hz and 1 \u2013 3 Hz), \n\nwere plotted over time. Normality and homoscedasticity were tested using the Software Package \n\nSigmaStat for Windows, version 3.5. Original behavioural MFB data were arcsin transformed and \n\nthe overall effect of contaminated sediments on population behaviour was investigated using a \n\nKruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks (p<0.001), followed by a post hoc Dunn\u2019s test (p<0.05) \n\nto check for significant differences (Zar, 1996). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 95 \n\nResults \n\nCharacteristics and composition of the sediments \n\nIn this study metals, metalloid (As) and sulphur pollution in an abandoned cupric pyrite \n\nore mining area was investigated (\u201cmetals\u201d will be used therefore to refer to metals and \n\nmetalloid). To study the role of sediment toxicity in a mining area several sediments collected at \n\nthe mine were analysed and tested. The results of the sediments characterization analysis are \n\npresented in Table I.  \n\n \n\nTable I \u2013 Sediments characterization (Sand > 2.0mm; 2.0mm &lt;Silt &lt;100\u00b5m; Clay &lt;100\u00b5m; TOC \n\n= Total Organic Carbon; AVS = Acid volatile sulfid; DO2 = dissolved oxygen). \n\nParameters Reference Sed A Sed B Sed C Sed D Sed E \n\nOrganic matter (%) 2.26 5.11 6.24 2.96 2.78 3.14 \n\nAmmonium (mg/kg) 0.70 1.20 1.63 0.95 1.19 0.91 \n\nTOC (%) 0.31 0.45 1.70&lt;0.30&lt;0.30&lt;0.30 \n\nAVS (mg/kg) 0.57 0.28 0.63 0.81 0.90 0.82 \n\npH (sediment) 6.14 2.79 2.72 3.26 3.63 3.73 \n\npH (water, in situ) 6.89 2.50 3.73 4.49 5.49 6.54 \n\nDO2 (mg/l) 6.76 1.33 9.39 7.49 6.53 10.35 \n\nTemperature (\u00baC) 29.1 19.1 23.1 23.1 23.7 23.1 \n\nSand (%) 55.10 37.64 32.80 85.51 82.38 76.82 \n\nSilt (%) 44.18 48.55 53.02 14.47 17.29 23.03 \n\nClay (%) 0.72 13.81 14.18 0.02 0.33 0.15 \n\n \n\nTOC values in sediments were very low, ranging from&lt;0.30% to 1.70%. Mine \n\nsediments presented values of pH that ranged from 2.72 (sed-B) to 3.73 (sed-E). Sample \n\ncollection was performed in June, during a long dry period (several months), which can explain \n\nthe very low pH values found in the sediments. Temperature ranged from 19.1\u00baC (sed-A) to \n\n\n\n 96 \n\n29.1\u00baC (reference sediment). Although great differences were found in temperature values, it is \n\nmost likely that these differences are due to the time of the sediment collection. Even though all \n\nefforts were made to perform the collection as quickly as possible, the first one was collected at \n\n7am (sed-A) and the last one at 10:20am (sed-E). Bearing in mind that in June, in this part of \n\nPortugal, temperature rises very quickly, the differences observed in temperature values are \n\neasily explained. Reference sediment was collected at 12pm, which clearly justify the very high \n\ntemperature registered. Dissolved oxygen ranged from 1.33 mg/l (sed-A) to 10.35 mg/l (sed-E) \n\nand organic matter in the sediments ranged from 2.26% in the reference sediment to 6.24% in \n\nsed-B. AVS lowest value was found in reference sediment (0.57 mg/kg) and sed-D presented the \n\nhighest value (0.90 mg/kg). Organic matter ranged from 2.26% (reference sediment) to 6.24% \n\n(sed-B). Sediments were mainly composed of sand (Figure 4) (ranged from 76.82% for sed-E to \n\n85.51% for sed-C) except sed-A and B. Clay and silt (small particles) combined ranged from \n\n14.49% (sed-C) to 67.20% (sed-B). Conductivity (Figure 4) values ranged from 253 \u00b5S/cm \n\n(reference sediment) to 715 \u00b5S/cm (sed-B).  \n\n \n\nFigure 4. Composition of collected sediments and conductivity. \n\n \n\n\n\n 97 \n\nTo estimate the possible environmental consequences of the metal contamination, \n\nmetal values in the sediment were also compared to sediment quality guidelines (SQG) (Table II). \n\nSQG provide concentrations of metals that have no effect on the majority of sediment dwelling \n\norganisms (Threshold Effect Level \u2013 TEL) and concentrations that indicate polluted sediments \n\nand are likely to affect organisms health (Probable Effect Level \u2013 PEL). Most sediments \n\npresented concentrations of As above the PEL (Table III), which indicate that those sediments, \n\nbased on their metal content, should have been toxic. Sediments A and B had the most metals \n\nexciding PEL and only the reference site had no metal exceeding PEL, but As exceeded TEL. \n\nCadmium did not exceeded TEL in any of the sediments, values were all below the detection \n\nlimit. Knowing the nature of this mine, low values of cadmium were in fact expected.  Comparing \n\ncontaminated sediments and based on metal concentrations, sed-B is the most contaminated and \n\nsed-C is the least contaminated. In general, samples collected in place B had the highest \n\nconcentration of all elements.

For \n\ncontaminated sediments, mortalities (Table IV) ranged from 100% (sed-A and B) to 32.6% (sed-\n\nD). Correlations were calculated between mortality and total metal in the sediment, TOC, AVS \n\nand silt+clay (Table V). The strongest correlation was found between mortality and total metal in \n\nsediments (r=0.707), meaning that mortality increases when concentration of metals in sediment \n\nis higher. Furthermore, a strong correlation was found between mortality and silt+clay (r=0.632), \n\nindicating that sediments with a higher percentage of fine grains are more toxic. Moderate \n\nassociation was found between mortality and TOC (positive association) and mortality and AVS \n\n(negative association). The influence of Fe was evaluated by correlating and Fe/MT (the ratio of \n\nFe to total metal) with L. variegatus mortality (Table V). Correlation was r=-0.858, indicating a \n\nstrong linear negative association, which means that sediments with a high proportion of Fe were \n\nless toxic. \n\n\n\n 99 \n\nTable IV \u2013 Ten-day mortality for L. variegatus exposed to contaminated Mine sediments. \n\n Total Mortality (%) \n\nReference 0 \n\nSed-A 100 \n\nSed-B 100 \n\nSed-C 28.6 \n\nSed-D 32.6 \n\nSed-E 63.3 \n\n \n\nTable V \u2013 Correlations between some sediments parameters and mortality and growth. \n\n r P-value \n\nMortality / Sediment Metal 0.707 0.182 \n\nMortality / TOC 0.616 0.193 \n\nMortality / AVS -0.462 0.356 \n\nMortality / Silt+Clay 0.632 0.178 \n\nMortality / Fe/MT -0.858 0.029 \n\nSediment Metal / Body Metal -0.038 0.962 \n\nGrowth / Sediment Metal 0.760 0.450 \n\nGrowth / AVS 0.811 0.398 \n\nGrowth / Silt+Clay -0.661 0.540 \n\nGrowth / Fe/MT -0.500 0.667 \n\n \n\nAfter exposure to contaminated sediments, it was clear that the growth of the worms \n\nwas inhibited (Figure 5). All the tested sediments clearly inhibited the worms\u2019 growth and worms \n\nexposed to sed-E were the ones that grew less. Correlations were calculated between growth \n\nand total metal in the sediment, AVS, Fe/MT and silt+clay (not with TOC because data were \n\nbellow detection level) (Table V). Correlations were made for sediments C, D and E, since \n\n\n\n 100 \n\norganisms exposed to sed-A and B did not survive until the end of the experiment. The strongest \n\ncorrelation was between growth and AVS (r=0.811), meaning that growth increases when AVS \n\nlevels are higher. Negative correlations were found between growth and silt+clay (r=-0.661) and \n\ngrowth and Fe/MT (r=-0.500), which means that worms grow more in sediments with less \n\nsilt+clay percentage and with sediments with more Fe (or lower Fe/MT ratio). \n\n \n\nFigure 5.

Metals levels in \n\nwhole-body were very high for worms exposed to sed-C and Fe and S were the elements with \n\nhigher concentrations (as they were the most abundant in those sediments). Correlation between \n\nmetals in the sediment and metals in the whole body presented a weak association (r=-0.038). \n\nBAF\u2019s (Table VII) values presented huge variations. Highest and lowest BAF values were found \n\nfor sed-C, for S and Mn, respectively. The highest BAFs generally occurred at the relatively clean \n\nsites (sed-C), which often contained low concentrations of elements in sediment.

Although \n\nboth behaviours were affected, after day 10 it was clear that locomotion was much more inhibited \n\nthan peristaltic movements, which means that although worms present some activity, their \n\nlocomotion was strongly reduced. Locomotion has been found to be a consistently sensitive \n\nmeasure of toxic stress for a wide range of environmental contamination (Little and Finger, 1990). \n\nNo locomotion signals were observed since day 4 for worms exposed to sed-D. Variances were \n\nnot homogeneously distributed but the results of the one-way ANOVA on ranks indicated in \n\ngeneral a significant sediment effect (p<0.05), for both locomotion and peristaltic movements. \n\n \n\nFigure 6. Average frequency (%) (\u00b1 ST Error) of locomotion and peristaltic movements \n\nthroughout short-term test (A= day 1; B= day 4; C= day 8; D= day 10). \n\n \n\n\n\n 103 \n\nDiscussion \n\nIn this investigation analysed the metal distribution in sediments collected at S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos Mine (Portugal). As the study mine is a cupric pyrite one, with ores of pyrite, \n\nchalcopyrite, shalerite and galena (MINEO, 2003), high values of Fe, S, Cu, Zn and Pb in the \n\ncollected sediments were expected. Sediments were characterized in terms of TOC, AVS, grain \n\nsize and metal content to investigate if these parameters contribute to the toxicity of sediments \n\nfrom S\u00e3o Domingos Mine. The low TOC levels, ranged from&lt;0.30% to 1.70%, may indicate the \n\nabsence of potentially harmful organic chemicals. TOC is added to sediments primarily through \n\nthe decomposition of plant and animal matter and can directly adsorb metals from solutions \n\napplied to sediments (Liber et al., 1996). However, it can also contain metals accumulated by \n\nplants that have been exposed to contaminated sediment during their lifetimes (Peltier et al., \n\n2003). Nonetheless, high percentages of organic matter and/or small grains in sediment are \n\ngenerally associated with reduced metal bioavailability and toxicity (Ankley et al., 1996). Organic \n\nmatter presented low values in all collected sediments probably due to the high temperature, \n\nwhich causes high degradation of organic matter. \n\nCation exchange capacity is based on the surface area of sediment grain particle \n\navailable for binding cations, such as hydrogen and free metal ions. Sediments with a high \n\npercentage of small grains, such as silt and clay, have high surface-to-volume ratios and can \n\nabsorb more metals than sediments composed of large grains, such as sand (Bentivegna et al., \n\n2004). Sand (levels above 32.8%) dominated, generally the grain size of sediments collected at \n\nS\u00e3o Domingos Mine and sediments with lower percentage of sand (sed-A and B) presented \n\nhigher concentrations of metals.  Using conductivity as a tool to classify according to grain size \n\ndistribution it is known that higher electric conductivity is representative of fine-grained sediments, \n\nsuch as silt or clay, whilst sand is characterized by distinctly lower electric conductivity (Segura et \n\nal, 2006). This was observed for sediments collected at the Mine where sediments A and B, the \n\nones with higher % of silt and clay presented the highest conductivity values, whilst sediments \n\nwith high % of sand (C, D and E) registered lower conductivity values. \n\n\n\n 104 \n\nResults showed poor sediment quality in most of the collected sediments, which was \n\nsupported by some visual observations: there were no resident organisms in the collection areas, \n\nonly an occasional specimen was found in sed-E (highest pH and the most distant from the mine \n\neffluent). Previous studies showed that Cu, Zn, Fe, S and As were the major contaminants in the \n\nS\u00e3o Domingos Mine (Gerhardt et al., 2004; Pereira et al., 2004). All the sediments collected \n\npresented at least one metal above the PEL, which indicate contamination. Most metal \n\nconcentrations were several orders of magnitude above threshold values reported for sediment, \n\nindicating the presence of severe pollution. \n\nFe and Mn are major metal components of both soil and sediment and can exist as \n\ndissolved ions or various precipitates, such as oxyhydroxides (oxides) and sulfides. Both Fe and \n\nMn oxides can remove other metals from solution, thus making them less bioavailable (Fan and \n\nWang, 2001). Our reference sediment showed high values of both Fe and Mn but was not toxic \n\nsediment, due to the presence of these metals that made other elements less available. Fe \n\nchemistry of sediments is known to control metal bioavailability. Research has shown that Fe \n\noxide precipitates can adsorb metals (Dong et al., 2000). For the sediments collected at S\u00e3o \n\nDomingos, once Fe levels increased relative to the total of other metals (Fe/MT), toxicity was \n\nreduced.  \n\nAs a consequence of metal pollution in aquatic systems, macroinvertebrates \n\naccumulate metals in concentrations that depend on those in the environment (Hare et al., 1991). \n\nThese accumulated concentrations could be used as an indirect tool to determine the degree of \n\nenvironment alteration (Sol\u00e1 et al., 2006). The accumulated metal concentrations are the result of \n\nthe input and output of metals in the body, which are determined by different processes that may \n\nvary among species, depending, for example, on cuticle type, the presence of external plate gills \n\n(Kiffney and Clements, 2003), physiology (Hare, 1992) or the processes which control metal \n\ndistribution in the cell (Luoma, 1989). Metal concentrations in macroinvertebrates are also directly \n\nrelated to those in the environment (Hare et al., 1991; Goodyear and McNeill, 1999) and, \n\ntherefore, to the degree of mine pollution. Pollution due to pyrite dissolution increases \n\nenvironmental metal concentrations, as well as conductivity (as a result of the sulphates present), \n\n\n\n 105 \n\nand decreases pH and alkalinity (as a result of protons) (Chapman and Kimstach, 1996; Farmer \n\nand Graham, 2003). Generally, these variables and metal concentrations tend to return to control \n\nvalues with the increasing distance to the source of pollution (Farmer and Graham, 2003). This \n\nwas observed for S\u00e3o Domingos Mine, with the totality of metal percentage tending to approach \n\ncontrol values on worms exposed to sed-E. \n\nWhole body metal concentrations and BAF may give information about the exposure of \n\nworms to metals, because worms accumulate metals when exposed to metal contaminated soil \n\nand sediment (Ireland and Wooton, 1976). Correlation between metals in the sediment and \n\nmetals in the whole body were weak and BAF\u2019s values seem to indicate that sed-C present a \n\ngreat potential for bioaccumulation. \n\nAnalysis of the sediment chemistry provides information on the pollutants present and \n\ntheir concentrations, but does not provide information on whether these pollutants are biologically \n\ndamaging. Laboratory bioassays are thus used to determine whether the sediment is in fact \n\nbiologically damaging (Lee et al., 2006). When testing sediments for toxicity, researchers \n\ncommonly use test organisms that incorporate and respond to multiple toxicity parameters and \n\nallow them to discriminate measurable concentrations of contaminants (Bentivegna et al, 2004). \n\nThe bulk of the literature on the subject shows that various natural sediment components can \n\ninteract with contaminants and limit their bioavailability and associated toxicity (Ankley et al., \n\n1996). L. variegatus have low sensitivity (in terms of mortality) to contaminants associated with \n\nsediment (Ingersoll et al, 2003). However, even with Lumbriculus low sensitivity, high mortalities \n\nwere observed in this study, which indicates severe contamination. Our data showed that \n\ncollected sediments did not support good L. variegatus growth. Several sediment parameters \n\nshowed strong correlations with L. variegatus mortality and growth and this indicates that the \n\nparameters were influencing toxicity even though responses between some sites did not appear \n\nto be very different. \n\nThese experiments showed that the behaviour of L. variegatus, in terms of locomotion \n\nand peristaltic movements, was significantly influenced by the exposure to sediments collected at \n\nS\u00e3o Domingos. The reduction in oligochaete movement could increase predation risk by limiting \n\n\n\n 106 \n\nthe ability to avoid capture. In addition, locomotor functions are integrally involved in vital worm \n\nbehaviours such as foraging, sexual reproduction, predator avoidance, dispersal, and general \n\norientation to environmental cues (Drewes, 1997). Behaviour is involved in many fundamental \n\nfunctions and the present study strongly indicates that behavioural parameters give crucial \n\ninformation that cannot be ignored. Behaviour proved to be an important parameter and it was \n\npossible to detect early warning signals of exposed worms, demonstrating that behavioural \n\nparameters may be included in risk assessment protocols. \n\nAlthough the metal values in this work are total metal concentrations and do not provide \n\na direct indication of bioavailability, the high values found indicate that severe contamination \n\nwithin S\u00e3o Domingos Mine will probably be a limiting factor for the ecological recovery of that \n\narea. We recommend further studies of metals in the sediment of S\u00e3o Domingos Mine, as well as \n\nan investigation of the potential contribution of organic contaminants to sediment toxicity.   \n\n \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to express their gratitude to Matti Lepp\u00e4nen and to \n\nJussi Kukkonen for providing us the worms for starting our culture.

In this thesis, new behavioural online sediment\n\ntoxicity tests for L. variegatus were developed and compared to existing standard methods.\n\nSediments are one of the areas where environmental problems are a concern and for that reason\n\nin this study behaviour of sediment organisms, as a toxicological test parameter, was evaluated\n\n(although other parameters were also used).\n\nAnother major goal of this work was to improve the scientific knowledge about the use of\n\nbehavioural parameters in standard toxicity tests. The selected species and the assays developed\n\nto assess the environmental impact of metals and pesticides on behaviour were very successful,\n\nas shown on Chapters 3 and 4. The development of behavioural endpoints in toxicity assessment\n\nhas improved the sensitivity and versatility of toxicological studies (Little, 1990). Behavioural\n\nresponses are often effective indicators of contamination in biomonitoring programs (Diamond\n\net al., 1990).\n\nBefore starting the assessment of the potential use of behaviour as a test parameter, some\n\npreliminary studies were performed. The purpose of these tests was to identify the best sediment\n\ntypes for the use of L. variegatus in sediment toxicity tests, based on grain-size and included\n\nmeasures of behaviour, growth and reproduction.\n\nAfter the preliminary tests, two experiments were designed using two different chemicals,\n\nwith different mode of action and different behaviour in the environment: a metal (lead) and\n\nan insecticide (imidacloprid). Metals are relatively low toxic but do not degrade and have a\n\ntendency to accumulate in the environment and organisms (Laskowski, 2001). The insecticide\n\nused here is known to be highly toxic but is degraded gradually after application.\n\nThe last experiment (Chapter 5) was performed with sediments collected at a polluted site:\n\nan abandoned cupric pyrite mine. Sa?o Domingos mine (southern Portugal) (Figure 6.1) contains\n\nsediments that are severely contaminated with metals (MINEO, 2003) but the extension of such\n\ncontamination has not been investigated. The chosen study area was situated at the confluence\n\nof the Mosteira?o stream with the mine effluent, representing an area with a natural pH and\n\nmetal concentration gradient, where five sediments with different pH and associated metals were\n\ncollected and investigated.\n\nSome major outputs can be drawn from this work, regarding several aspects under investi-\n\ngation:\n\n- Type of sediment and artificial cloning (Chapter 2): This study shows the role of behaviour\n\nin assisting the design of appropriate sediment toxicity tests. Our findings will help making\n\n114\n\n\n\nNew sediment toxicity tests for Lumbriculus variegatus\n\nFigure 6.1: Location of Sa?o Domingos Mine (Adapted from Pereira et al., 2004)\n\nstandard tests more useful in the future and also lead to other uses of aquatic behavioral re-\n\nsponses. Although fine sediment showed the best results for health and vitality of the study\n\nspecies, ecologically relevant sediments such as whole sediments should be used on both\n\nculture and toxicity tests. Furthermore, to achieve successful cultures, artificial cloning is\n\nnot recommended. Even though L. variegatus present an extraordinary power of regenera-\n\ntion (Hyman, 1916), no forced cloning should be performed to obtain extra test organisms.\n\nWorms generated by forced cloning showed a decrease in movements and less growth, which\n\nmay point to genetic impoverishment.\n\n- Effects of exposure to metal lead (Chapter 3): If lead is available, the presence of L.\n\nvariegatus in nature will be affected since this metal interferes in the growth process. Some\n\nadverse effects of exposure to lead were noted on behaviour and may reduce the ability of\n\nL. variegatus to escape from predators. This would obviously lead to metal transfer from\n\noligochaetes to organisms occupying higher trophic levels. Behaviour as a test parameters\n\nshowed great potential and provided important data.\n\n- Effects of exposure to pesticide imidacloprid (Chapter 4): Oligochaetes feed on subsurface\n\nsediments and egest onto the sediment surface hence recycling deposited material. In high\n\nworm densities, reworking can considerably modify the structure of sediments (Krezoski\n\nand Robbins, 1985; McCall and Fisher, 1980). Imidacloprid exposure affects the survival,\n\ngrowth and behaviour of L. variegatus, thus also affects the balance of the ecosystem. As\n\nit is likely that behaviour inhibition could have a severe effect on oligochaete performance\n\n115\n\n\n\nAna Margarida Sardo\n\nin the environment, this endpoint is important to evaluate the impacts of pollutants and\n\npesticides on sediment ecosystems.\n\n- Differences between tested toxics (Chapters 3 and 4): the toxics used in this study represent\n\ntwo completely different groups of chemicals. While metals tend to accumulate slowly\n\nin the environment and later in the organisms without degrade, pesticides are primarily\n\ndesigned to kill rapidly and then degrade (Laskowski, 2001). Substantial differences in\n\nthe action of the two tested toxics (lead and imidacloprid) were observed. Exposure to\n\nsediments contaminated with lead showed acceptable rates of survival (low mortality),\n\nmeaning that the metal can accumulate in the organism and metal transfer can occur to\n\nthe next generations and organisms from higher trophic levels. The pesticide caused high\n\nmortality at the beginning of the experiment, however some organisms were able to live for\n\nas long as in the control. Higher concentrations of imidacloprid decreased growth rate and\n\nactivity. Similar results were observed by Laskowski (2001) while comparing the effects of\n\na metal (cadmium) to a pesticide (imidacloprid).\n\n- Sediment toxicity in a cupric pyrite mine (Chapter 5): The abandoned Sa?o Domingos mine\n\nis a potentially good site for ecotoxicological studies, due to a pH and metal gradient of acid\n\nmine drainage. Metal polluted sites represent a potentially hazardous risk for human health\n\nand the environment (Martine?z-Sa?nchez et al., 2007). Abandoned mines can be responsible\n\nfor several impacts in their surrounding environment due to the chemical nature of their\n\neffluents (Boult et al., 1994). L. variegatus have low sensitivity (in terms of mortality)\n\nto contaminants associated with sediment (Ingersoll et al., 2003). However, even with\n\nthis species low sensitivity, high mortalities were observed, which indicates very strong\n\ncontamination. The highly metal concentrations found indicate that severe contamination\n\nwithin Sa?o Domingos Mine will probably be a limiting factor for the ecological recovery\n\nof that area. Several sediment parameters showed strong correlations between mortality\n\nand growth, which indicates that those parameters were influencing toxicity even though\n\nresponses between some sites did not appear to be very different. The behaviour of L.\n\nvariegatus was significantly reduced when worms were exposed to sediments collected at\n\nthe Sa?o Domingos Mine, which may lead to a decrease in the ability to avoid capture and\n\nthus increase the predation risk.\n\n- Importance of laboratorial tests with field collected sediments (Chapter 5): Sediment toxic-\n\nity testing on field collected whole sediments and laboratory dosed sediments is an essential\n\nline-of-evidence that the contaminants in sediment can produce the effects that are observed\n\nin benthic communities (Burton and Landrum, 2003). These studies represent more real-\n\n116\n\n\n\nNew sediment toxicity tests for Lumbriculus variegatus\n\nistic approaches and are a fundamental \u201ccalibration\u201d for the previous experiments. One\n\nof the major challenges in assessing the ecological risk associated with exposure to field-\n\ncontaminated sediments is the presence of chemical mixtures. Field-collected sediments,\n\nas a rule, contain complex mixtures of chemicals and other factors that influence toxic\n\nresponse (US EPA, 2005) and our study site was not an exception. Sediments collected at\n\nthe mine presented at least six different metals, one metalloid and sulphur pollution.\n\n6.2 Final Remarks\n\nThe main purpose of this study was to develop new sediment toxicity tests using behaviour\n\nof L. variegatus as one of the tested parameters. Since alterations of behaviour can be linked to\n\neffects at the ecosystem levels, behaviour represents a promising tool in ecotoxicological studies\n\n(Doving, 1992; Little, 1990; Scherrer, 1992).\n\nIt is likely that behaviour inhibition could have a severe effect on oligochaete performance\n\nin the environment, increasing predation risk by limiting the ability to avoid capture. In ad-\n\ndition, locomotor functions are integrally involved in vital worm behaviours such as foraging,\n\nsexual reproduction, predator avoidance, dispersal, and general orientation to environmental\n\ncues (Drewes, 1997). Therefore, behaviour is important to evaluate the impacts of pollutants on\n\nsediment ecosystems. When used as hazard assessment tools, behavioural assays reflect sublethal\n\ntoxicity and often give a highly sensitive estimate of no-effect concentrations (Little and Finger,\n\n1990; Goodrich and Lech, 1990; Strickler-Shaw and Taylor, 1990).\n\nAlthough behaviour cannot replace standard toxicity endpoints, we suggest that it should\n\nbe introduced as an additional parameter. It is a fast endpoint (faster than mortality and\n\ngrowth) thus important in early warning systems and results can be obtained at ecological rele-\n\nvant concentrations (lower that lethal concentrations), which not always happen with mortality\n\nand growth. Behaviour integrates many cellular processes as is essential to the viability of the\n\norganism, population and community. Therefore, observations of behaviour provide a unique\n\ntoxicological perspective: one that links the biochemical and ecological consequences of envi-\n\nronmental contamination (Little, 1990). Because behaviour is important in activities such as\n\npredator avoidance, sexual interactions and feeding, an impact on behaviour leads to an impact\n\non population dynamics. One major advantage of the use of behavioural parameters is that\n\nresponses based on behaviour are optimal for cost-effective and ecologically relevant toxicity\n\nevaluations and very adequate for biological early warning studies.\n\nDetecting early warning signals of exposed worms was possible on this investigation, demon-\n\nstrating that behavioural parameters may be included in risk assessment protocols. Behaviour\n\n117\n\n\n\nAna Margarida Sardo\n\nproved to be an important parameter, and in the future different ways of measure or assess\n\nbehavioural parameters should be tested and explored.\n\nFurther studies regarding the presence and availability of metals in the sediments of Sa?o\n\nDomingos Mine should be performed, as well as an investigation of the potential contribution\n\nof organic contaminants to sediment toxicity. Our results indicate severe contamination and the\n\nhigh values found point to acute contamination within Sa?o Domingos Mine, which will probably\n\nbe a limiting factor for the ecological recovery of that area. Because some small livestock is\n\nexposed to metals by grazing in the mine area and since transfer of contaminants to humans\n\nmay occur through meat and milk, a Human Health Risk Assessment should also be made.\n\n6.3 References\n\nBoult S, Collins DN, White KN, Curtis CD. 1994.
