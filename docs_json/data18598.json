O mangan\u00eas \u00e9 de dif\u00edcil remo\u00e7\u00e3o devido a sua alta solubilidade em meio \u00e1cido \n\nou neutro e pode ser encontrado em altas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es nessas \u00e1guas, conforme a \n\nmineralogia das rochas. Por outro lado, a presen\u00e7a de \u00edons sulfato \u00e9 normalmente devida \n\n\u00e0 oxida\u00e7\u00e3o de minerais sulfetados e tamb\u00e9m pode ser encontrado em concentra\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nelevadas nas drenagens de mina. Portanto, este trabalho investigou a remo\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nmangan\u00eas e do sulfato das \u00e1guas neutras de mina, com experimentos em tanques \n\nagitados e em colunas de leito fixo. Para a remo\u00e7\u00e3o de mangan\u00eas, este estudo envolveu \n\na precipita\u00e7\u00e3o dos \u00edons Mn (II) presentes em \u00e1guas de mina com concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\n140 mg.L\n-1\n\n e pH 6,5, aplicando misturas do carbonato de s\u00f3dio e do calc\u00e1rio. Observou-\n\nse que, al\u00e9m da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o total do carbonato, o pH tamb\u00e9m influenciou na \n\nprecipita\u00e7\u00e3o do carbonato de mangan\u00eas. Uma remo\u00e7\u00e3o de 99,9% do mangan\u00eas foi \n\nalcan\u00e7ada com \u00edons carbonatos, para pH da solu\u00e7\u00e3o acima de 8,5. Avaliou-se tamb\u00e9m a \n\naplica\u00e7\u00e3o do calc\u00e1rio para adsor\u00e7\u00e3o do mangan\u00eas nas \u00e1guas de mina para baixa \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o do elemento (1,5 e 15,0 mg.L\n-1\n\n). Observou-se que o equil\u00edbrio da adsor\u00e7\u00e3o \n\npode ser descrito pelas equa\u00e7\u00f5es de Freundlich ou de Langmuir, sendo o carregamento \n\nm\u00e1ximo alcan\u00e7ado de 0,91 mgMn.g\n-1\n\n calc\u00e1rio em sistemas agitados. Os modelos de \n\nThomas, de Yoon e Nelson e de Dose-resposta apresentaram uma boa correla\u00e7\u00e3o com \n\nos resultados obtidos em coluna de leito fixo. O modelo BDST conformou o baixo \n\ncarregamento de mangan\u00eas, ou seja 0,057 mgMn.mL\n-1\n\n leito, para concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\n15,0 mgMn.L\n-1\n\n e vaz\u00e3o de 1 mL.min\n-1\n\n. Nos experimentos de remo\u00e7\u00e3o do sulfato, em \n\nsistema cont\u00ednuo a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o deste \u00edon foi reduzida de 588 para 87 mg.L\n-1\n\n, em \n\n210 minutos. Os experimentos de equil\u00edbrio mostraram que o carregamento do sulfato \n\nno calc\u00e1rio pode ser descrito pela isoterma de Langmuir, com carregamento m\u00e1ximo de \n\n23,7 mgSO4 \n2-\n\n.g\n-1\n\n de calc\u00e1rio. O processo de adsor\u00e7\u00e3o em leito fixo pode tamb\u00e9m ser \n\ndescrito por modelos de Thomas, de Yoon e Nelson e de Dose-resposta. Nestes \n\nsistemas, para part\u00edculas de calc\u00e1rio na faixa granulom\u00e9trica entre 0,42-0,59 mm, o \n\ncarregamento foi de 20 mgSO4\n2-\n\n.L\n-1\n\n leito. A espectrofotometria no infravermelho \n\nindicou a presen\u00e7a de \u00edons sulfato e de carbonato do mangan\u00eas na superf\u00edcie do calc\u00e1rio. \n\nObservou-se que o calc\u00e1rio \u00e9 efetivo na remo\u00e7\u00e3o do mangan\u00eas somente para baixa \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o do metal (1,5 mg.L\n-1\n\n). Entretanto, pode ser utilizado como etapa de \n\npolimento para \u00e1gua neutra de mina contendo entre 250 e 1200 mg.L\n-1\n\n de sulfato, onde \n\na precipita\u00e7\u00e3o de gesso n\u00e3o \u00e9 mais efetiva.   \n\nPalavras chaves: mangan\u00eas, sulfato, calc\u00e1rio, adsor\u00e7\u00e3o, precipita\u00e7\u00e3o, \u00e1gua de mina, \n\nmodelos adsor\u00e7\u00e3o, carbonato de s\u00f3dio. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nii \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\n \nBoth sulfate and manganese removals are important challenges in the treatment of mine \n\nwaters. Manganese is difficult to remove due its high solubility in acid or neutral \n\neffluents. It can be found in high concentrations in mine waters, depending on the rock \n\nmineralogy. On the other hand, the presence of sulfate ions is normally due to the \n\noxidation of sulfide minerals. Therefore, this work investigated the removal of \n\nmanganese and sulfate from neutral mine waters, through experiments in agitated tanks \n\nand fixed-bed columns. The study addressed Mn(II) precipitation in mine waters \n\ncontaining 140 mg.L\n-1\n\n Mn at pH 6.5, applying mixtures of sodium carbonate and \n\nlimestone. It was observed that, in addition to the carbonate concentration, pH also \n\ninfluenced manganese precipitation as MnCO3. A removal of  99.9% Mn was reached \n\nwith carbonate ions, provided the solution pH was above 8.5. In addition, the \n\napplication of limestone as a sorbent for low concentration Mn waters (1.5 mg.L\n-1\n\n and \n\n15.0 mg. L\n-1\n\n) was also assessed. It was observed that sorption can be described by either \n\nFreundlich or Langmuir equations with 0.91 mgMn.g\n-1\n\n limestone as the maximum \n\nvalue. The models of Thomas, Yoon and Nelson and Dose-response were able to \n\ndescribe manganese sorption in fixed-bed columns. The BDST model confirmed the \n\nlow manganese loading on limestone, as a maximum of  0.057 mgMn.mL-bed\n-1\n\n was \n\nobserved for a 15.0 mgMn.L\n-1\n\n mine water, at a flow rate of 1 mL.min\n-1\n\n. In the \n\nexperiments of sulfate removal, the concentration of this ion was reduced from \n\n588 mg.L\n-1\n\n to 87 mg.L\n-1\n\n, in 210 minutes. Sulfate sorption on limestone was described \n\nby the Langmuir isotherm, with maximum loading of 23.7  mgSO4\n2-\n\n.g\n-1\n\n. The adsorption \n\nprocess was also modeled with the Thomas, Yoon and Nelson and Dose-response \n\nmodels, whereby sorption parameters were determined. With a limestone particle size \n\nbetween 0.42 and 0.59 mm, a bed loading of 20 mgSO4\n2-\n\n.L\n-1\n\n was observed. Infrared \n\nspectrofotometry indicated the presence of sulfate ions and manganese  carbonate on the \n\nlimestone surface. It was observed that the limestone is effective in the removal of \n\nmanganese only at low metal concentration (1.5 mg.L\n-1\n\n). However, it can be applied in \n\nsulfate removal from neutral mine waters containing between 250 mg.L\n-1\n\n and \n\n1200 mg.L\n-1\n\n, for which gypsum precipitation is not effective.  \n\n \n\n \n\nKey-words: manganese, sulfate, limestone, adsorption, mine water, sorption models, \n\nsodium carbonate. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\niii \n\nSUM\u00c1RIO \n\nCAP\u00cdTULO 1 ............................................................................................................................. 1 \n\n1.1 -

Merecem destaque os processos de tratamento de min\u00e9rios (moagem, \n\nespessamento, flota\u00e7\u00e3o, deslamagem, entre outros) e os que formam a chamada \u201cMetalurgia \n\nExtrativa dos Metais N\u00e3o-Ferrosos\u201d, mais especificamente os Processos Hidrometal\u00fargicos, \n\nou Hidrometalurgia. A Hidrometalurgia visa \u00e0 produ\u00e7\u00e3o de metais (ouro, prata, zinco, \n\ncobre, n\u00edquel, cobalto, entre outros) atrav\u00e9s de rea\u00e7\u00f5es que se realizam em meio aquoso. Os \n\nimpactos dessas atividades sobre os corpos de \u00e1gua s\u00e3o diversos, uma vez que se faz \n\nnecess\u00e1rio devolver aos leitos dos rios e lagos a \u00e1gua utilizada nesses processos de \n\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o. Por\u00e9m, essa devolu\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o pode ser feita de qualquer maneira, j\u00e1 que existem \n\ncontaminantes que podem provocar danos ao meio ambiente. Os efluentes l\u00edquidos \n\nindustriais, por exemplo, precisam primeiro, ser tratados para retornar \u00e0 natureza e, para \n\nisso, existem pol\u00edticas e normas a serem seguidas, que estabelecem a quantidade de \n\ncontaminantes que podem ser lan\u00e7ados no meio ambiente. \n\n \n\n \n\nOs principais contaminantes encontrados nos efluentes da ind\u00fastria mineral s\u00e3o os c\u00e1tions \n\ne \u00e2nions, como sulfato e cloreto, entre outros. As remo\u00e7\u00f5es do mangan\u00eas e do sulfato s\u00e3o \n\nconsideradas, atualmente, um dos principais desafios no tratamento de efluentes da \n\nind\u00fastria mineral no pa\u00eds.  O mangan\u00eas n\u00e3o \u00e9 facilmente removido pelo fato de sua qu\u00edmica \n\nem solu\u00e7\u00e3o ser mais complexa que a dos outros metais, tais como zinco, ferro, cromo e \n\n\n\n 2 \n\ncobre, uma vez que sua precipita\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o ocorre pelo simples ajuste do pH, a pr\u00e1tica mais \n\nutilizada na ind\u00fastria. Al\u00e9m disso, como ocorre associado ao ferro, \u00e9 muito comum nas \n\nminera\u00e7\u00f5es, tanto de metais ferrosos quanto de n\u00e3o-ferrosos (Silva, 2007). A presen\u00e7a de \n\nelevados teores de \u00edons sulfato em efluentes l\u00edquidos \u00e9 devida ao uso do \u00e1cido sulf\u00farico, \n\num reagente barato e est\u00e1vel, em diversos processos, como por exemplo: nas ind\u00fastrias de \n\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de cobre e de n\u00edquel; nas linhas de galvaniza\u00e7\u00e3o de a\u00e7os; na produ\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1cido \n\nfosf\u00f3rico; na remo\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e1cida de impurezas; entre outros (Rampinelli, 2007). Outra fonte de \n\npolui\u00e7\u00e3o por sulfato na ind\u00fastria m\u00ednero metal\u00fargica \u00e9 a forma\u00e7\u00e3o da drenagem \u00e1cida de \n\nmina (DAM). A DAM \u00e9 formada pela oxida\u00e7\u00e3o, catalisada por micro-organismos de \n\nsulfetos de ferro como pirita (FeS2) e pirrotita (Fe1-xS). O baixo valor de pH da DAM \n\nfavorece a dissolu\u00e7\u00e3o dos metais presentes na rocha e por isso diferentes \u00edons met\u00e1licos \n\npodem ser encontrados em elevadas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es dependendo da mineralogia da rocha. \n\nMuitos desses \u00edons s\u00e3o removidos durante o tratamento da DAM com subst\u00e2ncias \n\nalcalinas, pois o aumento do pH provoca a precipita\u00e7\u00e3o de v\u00e1rios metais, entretanto, \n\nelementos como, ars\u00eanio e mangan\u00eas s\u00e3o de dif\u00edcil remo\u00e7\u00e3o. Quando na rocha h\u00e1 a \n\npresen\u00e7a de minerais portadores de alcalinidade, a acidez da DAM \u00e9 neutralizada, tendo-se \n\na drenagem neutra de mina. Nesse caso, a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de metais dissolvidos \u00e9 menor, \n\nmas ainda podem ser encontrados n\u00edveis elevados de sulfato e de mangan\u00eas.  \n\n \n\n \n\nEm termos de efeitos sobre a sa\u00fade humana, o mangan\u00eas pode produzir irrita\u00e7\u00e3o neuro \n\nmuscular (WHO, 1981). O consumo de \u00e1gua contaminada com sulfato em n\u00edveis elevados \n\ndeve ser evitado, principalmente por crian\u00e7as e gestantes, pois ainda n\u00e3o s\u00e3o \n\ncompletamente conhecidos os riscos \u00e0 sa\u00fade humana decorrentes do consumo de teores \n\nelevados de \u00e2nions. Estima-se que estes \u00edons tamb\u00e9m possam estar correlacionados \u00e0 \n\nocorr\u00eancia de problemas renais, al\u00e9m de diarr\u00e9ia, (WHO, 2004). Devido aos seus efeitos \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nt\u00f3xicos, o descarte de efluentes l\u00edquidos \u00e9 regulado pelo Conselho Nacional do Meio \n\nAmbiente - CONAMA, atrav\u00e9s de sua Resolu\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00ba 357 art. 24, e pelo Conselho Estadual \n\nde Pol\u00edtica Ambiental - COPAM / Conselho Estadual de Recursos H\u00eddricos - CERH \u2013 MG, \n\natrav\u00e9s de sua Delibera\u00e7\u00e3o Normativa Conjunta 001, que afirmam: \u201cos efluentes de \n\nqualquer fonte poluidora somente poder\u00e3o ser lan\u00e7ados, direta ou indiretamente, nos \n\ncorpos de \u00e1gua, ap\u00f3s o devido tratamento e desde que obede\u00e7am \u00e0s condi\u00e7\u00f5es, padr\u00f5es e \n\nexig\u00eancias dispostos nesta (...) e em outras normas aplic\u00e1veis\u201d. Segundo esses \u00f3rg\u00e3os, o \n\npadr\u00e3o de lan\u00e7amento contendo mangan\u00eas para efluentes \u00e9 de 1,0 mg.L\n-1\n\n  e para \u00e1guas de \n\nClasse 2 \u00e9 de 0,1 mg L\n-1\n\n, e o padr\u00e3o de lan\u00e7amento de sulfato \u00e9 de 250,0 mg. L\n-1 \n\npara \u00e1guas \n\nde Classe 2. \n\n \n\nSegundo o International Network for Acid Prevention (2003), o tratamento de efluentes \n\ncontendo altos teores de sulfato, geralmente, inclui a combina\u00e7\u00e3o das etapas de \n\nneutraliza\u00e7\u00e3o e precipita\u00e7\u00e3o com cal, osmose reversa, eletrodi\u00e1lise, adsor\u00e7\u00e3o, troca i\u00f4nica, \n\nentre outras. Entretanto, algumas dessas t\u00e9cnicas t\u00eam sido pouco utilizadas, por serem \n\neconomicamente invi\u00e1veis ou ineficientes. A remo\u00e7\u00e3o de sulfato pode ser obtida por \n\nprecipita\u00e7\u00e3o com a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de hidr\u00f3xido de c\u00e1lcio (Ca(OH)2) ou carbonato de c\u00e1lcio \n\n(CaCO3) (Garcia et. al., 2001). Entretanto, a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o residual de sulfato, quando h\u00e1 \n\nprecipita\u00e7\u00e3o de gesso, situa-se entre 1500 e 2000 mg.L\n-1\n\n, ou seja, muito acima do requerido \n\npela legisla\u00e7\u00e3o. Kothari (1988) e Laus et al. (2005) observaram que a remo\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nmangan\u00eas pode ser alcan\u00e7ada por meio de v\u00e1rios m\u00e9todos e que o tipo de tratamento \n\ndepende da \u00e1gua a ser tratada. Podem ser citados como exemplos de m\u00e9todos para a \n\nremo\u00e7\u00e3o de mangan\u00eas: a precipita\u00e7\u00e3o (Silva, 2007; Aziz et al., 2008), a troca i\u00f4nica \n\n(Dayube e Trindade, 2004) e a adsor\u00e7\u00e3o (Babel e Kurniawan, 2003; Mohan e Chander, \n\n2006; Barakat, 2008; Lee et al., 2009; Emmanuel e Rao, 2009).  \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nDentre os m\u00e9todos de remo\u00e7\u00e3o de mangan\u00eas e sulfato citados, a adsor\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 uma das \n\nt\u00e9cnicas mais aplicadas no mundo. Viu-se na aplica\u00e7\u00e3o da t\u00e9cnica e na utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\ncalc\u00e1rio uma op\u00e7\u00e3o para remo\u00e7\u00e3o do mangan\u00eas e do sulfato, pois o calc\u00e1rio \u00e9 um material \n\namplamente dispon\u00edvel no pa\u00eds e pode ser uma alternativa vi\u00e1vel para esse processo de \n\nremo\u00e7\u00e3o, ao se considerar a aplicabilidade t\u00e9cnica, a simplicidade do processo e o custo-\n\nefic\u00e1cia como sendo fatores chaves na escolha do tratamento mais adequado para efluentes \n\ninorg\u00e2nicos (Sengupta, 1993; Silva, 2007; Barakat, 2008). Por outro lado, os efluentes das \n\nminera\u00e7\u00f5es brasileiras cont\u00eam teores de mangan\u00eas maiores que os encontrados em outras \n\n\u00e1guas de mina ao redor do mundo. Estes elevados teores n\u00e3o s\u00e3o facilmente remov\u00edveis \n\napenas por adsor\u00e7\u00e3o, dessa forma, outras t\u00e9cnicas, como a precipita\u00e7\u00e3o, precisam ser \n\navaliadas, sendo a precipita\u00e7\u00e3o com o \u00edon carbonato sol\u00favel uma das alternativas em \n\npotencial. A remo\u00e7\u00e3o dos metais presentes em um efluente industrial \u00e9 feita, normalmente, \n\npela eleva\u00e7\u00e3o do valor do pH at\u00e9 que os metais tenham sua concentra\u00e7\u00e3o em solu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nreduzida ao limite requerido pela legisla\u00e7\u00e3o, entretanto, para os elementos cuja qu\u00edmica em \n\nsolu\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 mais complexa, como \u00e9 o caso do mangan\u00eas e o sulfato, essa alternativa n\u00e3o \u00e9 \n\nefetiva.

Manganese sorption in limestone is a slow process, which can be \n\ndescribed by pseudofirst order kinetics. Equilibrium sorption could be successfully \n\nmodeled by the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms, and limestone showed a maximum \n\nmanganese loading of 0.91 mg.g\n-1\n\n. Fixed-bed sorption was also studied, and limestone \n\nuptake was observed to increase with the flow rate at low manganese concentration \n\n(1.5 mg.L\n-1\n\n) but decreased for mine water containing 15 mgMn.L\n-1\n\n. The Bed Depth \n\nService Time (BDST), Thomas, Yoon and Nelson, Wolborska and Dose response models \n\nwere fitted to breakthrough curves to determine the characteristic design parameters of the \n\ncolumn. With the exception of the Wolborska model, all studied equations could describe \n\nthe sorption process well. The maximum uptake was 0.0033 mg.g\n-1\n\n for a 15 mg.L\n-1\n\n \n\nmanganese solution at 1 mL.min\n-1\n\n, and zeta potential determinations showed that the \n\nlimestone surfaces were negatively charged. The solid residues obtained during the \n\nremoval process were characterized using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning \n\nelectron microscopy (SEM) to identify the reaction product. The presence of manganese \n\ncarbonate (MnCO3) on the limestone surface was verified during the experiments with \n\nmine water. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Environmental; Pollution; Extractive Metallurgy; Reclamation. \n\n \n\n  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 13 \n\n2.1 - Introduction \n\n \n\nWater in the mining industry has been a source of concern because of its contamination by \n\ntoxic metals and other substances that require treatment before discharge. Such treatments \n\nmust be carried out using operations and processes that aim to reduce the contaminant \n\nconcentration to levels required by environmental regulations or alternatively to those that \n\nenable water recycling in the production process. Manganese removal is one of the most \n\ndifficult challenges for water management in the mining industry. The removal of this and \n\nother elements is one of the required steps for effective water recycling.  \n\n \n\nManganese is one of the most abundant toxic elements in both superficial and underground \n\nwaters (Aziz and Smith, 1996; Franklin and Morse, 1983) as well as in the effluents and \n\ndrainages of several mining companies. Its solubility in natural waters is influenced by \n\nsuch factors as redox potential, pH and the presence of complexing agents such as \n\nbicarbonate and sulfate (Hem and Lind, 1994). Nevertheless, manganese is usually present \n\nin mining effluents as Mn\n2+\n\n.  \n\n \n\nManganese removal from wastewaters can be carried out by different approaches (Kothari, \n\n1988; Laus et al., 2006). Mn\n2+\n\n oxidation and precipitation as MnO2 followed by \n\nclarification is a common method. Oxidation can be performed by applying strong \n\noxidizing agents such as potassium permanganate, hypochlorite or ozone (Silva et al., \n\n2010). Nevertheless, the presence of both ferrous iron and organic matter increases oxidant \n\nconsumption such that iron removal is required prior to manganese oxidation. Manganese \n\ncan also be removed by precipitation as manganese carbonate (MnCO3) in the presence of \n\nalkalinity (Hem and Lind, 1994) or bio-oxidized to Mn(III), precipitating as oxy-\n\nhydroxides. \n\n\n\n 14 \n\nLimestone is commonly used as a neutralizer for acid effluents and acid mine drainages \n\n(Sun et al., 2000). Limestone was studied as a reactive barrier for acidic waters (pH 2.2), \n\nand its efficiency was compared with that of red mud (Komnitsas et al., 2004). Limestone \n\nincreased the solution pH to 8, which facilitated iron and aluminum removal, while \n\nmanganese and zinc uptakes were not as effective because the solution pH decreased when \n\nreactivity was lost as a result of iron precipitation over the limestone surface. For neutral \n\ndrainages, limestone can also be applied as an adsorbent for toxic metals. Aziz et al. (2008) \n\nstudied the sorption of a series of metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Ni, Cr) on limestone in batch \n\nexperiments where monovalent metal solutions (2 mg.L\n-1\n\n) were equilibrated with \n\npowdered limestone (2.36-4.77 mm) at pH 8.5. The sorption data were fitted to the \n\nLangmuir isotherm, and nickel showed the highest loading (38 mg.Kg\n-1\n\n limestone) \n\ncompared with the other metals. Similarly, experiments were performed for lead and \n\ncadmium sorption at neutral pH (5.0-7.0). Lead (40 mg.Kg\n-1\n\n) showed a higher affinity for \n\nlimestone compared with cadmium (1 mg.Kg\n-1\n\n); this was attributed to a stronger \n\ninteraction with the limestone surface due to a smaller hydrated ionic radius (Rangel-\n\nPorras et al., 2010).      \n\n \n\nEarly studies on Mn\n2+\n\n calcite interactions indicated strong sorption at low concentrations \n\n(below MnCO3 solubility) (Franklin and Morse, 1983). The lack of a sorption maximum \n\nwas interpreted to be an indication that both precipitation as well as adsorption accounted \n\nfor Mn\n2+\n\n uptake by calcite. Zachara et al. (1991) suggested that manganese sorption on \n\ncalcium carbonate occurs by either sorption, precipitation on the solid surface or formation \n\nof solid MeCO3(s)-CaCO3(s) solutions. Manganese carbonate or hydroxide formation was \n\nalso proposed by Komnitsas et al. (2004) as well as Silva et al., 2010.   \n\n \n\n\n\n 15 \n\nDespite its widespread use as neutralizer for acidic effluents, the application of limestone \n\nin the treatment of neutral drainages and effluents is far less studied.  In addition, no \n\ncomprehensive investigation has been undertaken regarding its utilization in fixed bed \n\nsorption of manganese, which is considered the most difficult toxic metal to remove from \n\nmine waters. Therefore, this work was undertaken to study the potential of applying \n\nlimestone for manganese sorption in both stirred and fixed bed reactors.  \n\n2.2 - Materials and methods  \n\n \n\n2.2.1 - Calcite limestone and mine waters \n\n \n\nA limestone sample (2.68 ton/m\n3\n) assaying 40.3% calcium and 1.23% magnesium was \n\nkindly provided by Brazilian producers. Calcite was confirmed as the main mineral phase \n\nby XRD diffraction. The solid material was first dry sieved using Tyler sieves and the \n\n<45 mm fraction was selected for dry grinding in a vibrating cup mill (Pulverisette 9, \n\nFritsch). Its particle size distribution was assessed by laser diffraction (CILAS - \n\nCompagnie Industrielle Des Lasers 1064) and resulted in a d50 value of 8.6 \u00b5m.  Surface \n\nand micropore areas were determined as 1.54 m\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n and 1.90 m\n\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n, respectively, by N2 \n\nadsorption (Nova 1000, Quantachrome). This solid sample was utilized in experiments in a \n\nstirred reactor. Another limestone sample with a particle size between 590 \u00b5m and 850 \u00b5m \n\n(0.569 m\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n specific surface area, 0.365 m\n\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n micropore area) was tested in both \n\nequilibrium and fixed bed experiments.  \n\n \n\nICP-OES was applied to assess the composition of two different mine waters.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 16 \n\n2.2.2 - Stirred-tank experiments \n\n \n\nPreliminary manganese removal experiments were carried out batchwise with the low \n\nmanganese mine water (1.5 mg.L\n-1\n\n). A volume of 0.12 L of mine water was transferred to \n\nerlenmeyer (0.25 L capacity) flasks and mixed with fine calcite limestone (d50= 8.6 \u00b5m) to \n\nproduce different pulp densities. The pulp was stirred in an orbital shaker (News \n\nBrunswick) at 300 min\n-1\n\n, pH 8.0 and 23?2\no\nC, during 10 hours. At the end of the \n\nexperiment, the pH was measured, the pulp was filtered (45 \u00b5m porosity), and the \n\nmanganese concentration in the aqueous phase was determined. This experiment was \n\nperformed to define the mass of limestone and the residence time for continuous testing. \n\n \n\nContinuous experiments were carried out in a 1.67 L capacity stirred reactor at 23?2\no\nC and \n\npH 8.0 with the low-manganese water (1.5 mg.L\n-1\n\n). The latter was fed separately with (i) \n\nmine water and (ii) a pulp made up of limestone and distilled water. The solid content of \n\nthe pulp was defined so that 4.2 g.L\n-1\n\n limestone was achieved within the reactor (after \n\nmixing both streams). Both flows were pumped at 24.0 mL.min\n-1\n\n (mine water) and \n\n4.0 mL.min\n-1\n\n (limestone pulp) into the reactor. The residence time was set at 60 minutes, \n\nand experiments were run for at least 9 residence times to ensure steady-state conditions. \n\nEvery 60 minutes, an aliquot was withdrawn from the reactor, filtered and the manganese \n\ncontent was determined by ICP-OES (Varian, 725); the solid residue was preserved for \n\nfurther analysis (MEV-EDS and infrared spectrophotometry). Prior to and during the \n\nexperiments, the mine water was stored in plastic containers at room temperature. \n\n \n\nThe subsequent experiments were performed with the 590-850 \u00b5m particle size fraction. \n\n \n\n\n\n 17 \n\n2.2.3 - Kinetics experiments \n\n \n\n \n\nKinetics modeling was applied to the sorption data and the pseudo-first-order and \n\npseudosecond-order models were tested. These experiments were performed by mixing \n\n1.5 L of the low manganese water at pH 8.0 containing 1.5 mg.L\n-1\n\n Mn\n2+\n\n and 25 g.L\n-1\n\n \n\nlimestone in an orbital shaker at 300 min\n-1\n\n and 23?2\no\nC. Another experiment was carried \n\nout following the same procedure with the 15 mg.L\n-1\n\n Mn\n2+\n\n mine water at pH 6.5 (initial \n\nvalue), which increased to 7.7 during the experiment. In both cases, samples were \n\nwithdrawn after 5 minutes in the first half hour and after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 24 hours. At \n\nthe end of the experiment, the pulp pH was measured, the slurry was filtered, and the \n\nmanganese concentration in the aqueous phase was determined. Manganese concentration \n\nin the solid phase was determined by mass balance. \n\n \n\n2.2.4 - Equilibrium experiments  \n\n \n\nA pseudo-sorption isotherm was drawn from the batch data using synthetic solution so that \n\nthe maximum limestone loading could be assessed. The procedure involved shaking at \n\n300 min\n-1\n\n in an orbital shaker, 0.12 L of the limestone pulp (3 g.L\n-1\n\n solids) added to 0.25 L \n\nerlenmeyer flasks. Manganese concentrations varied from 1.5 to 25 mg.L\n-1\n\n at pH 8.6-8.9 \n\nand the experiments were run for 10 hours. Afterwards, the sorption process was modeled \n\naccording to the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms. \n\n \n\n2.2.5 - Fixed \u2013bed experiments \n\n \n\nThese experiments were performed with the low and high manganese mine waters \n\n(Table 2.1).  Limestone particles with an average diameter of 720 \u00b5m (590-850 \u00b5m particle \n\n\n\n 18 \n\nsize range) were transferred to a glass column (2 cm diameter).  The column to particle \n\ndiameter ratio was approximately 23, which is considered sufficient to minimize wall \n\neffect. Glass wood felts were placed on the top and bottom of the fixed bed to prevent loss \n\nof the solid particles. Experiments were carried out with bed heights (Z) varying from 100 \n\nto 250 mm, which correspond to a limestone mass ranging from 38.57 to 98.71 g. The \n\ncolumn height exceeds 100 particle diameters, thus backmixing may be disregarded. After \n\nloading, distilled water was passed through the limestone bed (during 60 min) to remove \n\nany fine particles that could have been loaded in the column. The column was fed upward \n\nby peristaltic pumps (Milan) to either avoid or minimize low resistance pathways for the \n\nsolution, and the flow rate was varied from 1 to 3 mL.min\n-1\n\n. Effluent samples were \n\ncollected from the column every 30 minutes. These samples were then analyzed with \n\nrespect to manganese concentration, and metal loading on limestone was determined by \n\nmass balance.   \n\n \n\n2.2.6 - Sorption characterization \n\n \n\nA limestone sample was pulverized (d90<10 \u00b5m) and analyzed in a Zetasizer Nano ZS \n\nzetameter (Malvern). A pulp containing 0.5% solid and deionized water was prepared \n\nunder agitation, and either NaOH or HCl was used to obtain the desired pH (6-12).  \n\n \n\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the morphology of the leach \n\nresidues. The samples were coated with graphite by electro-deposition using a JEOL JEE \n\n4C instrument and investigated by a JEOL JSM 5510 scanning electron microscope (SEM) \n\nwith an accelerating voltage 0.5\u201330 kV equipped with a spectrometer for micro-analysis \n\nbased on an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy system (EDS).  \n\n \n\n\n\n 19 \n\nInfrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses were carried out in a Nicolet Nexus 470 model \n\nspectrophotometer equipped with a Centaurus microscope, an attenuated total reflectance \n\n(ATR) apparatus (Thermo) and a ZnSe internal reflection device. Medium infrared \n\nmeasurements were produced with a KBr beam splitter and a HgCdTe detector. The \n\nsamples were pressed against a flat glass surface and mounted under the ATR apparatus. \n\nThe spectra were collected in the 400-4000 cm\n-1 \n\nregion with a minimum of 32 scans at a \n\nresolution of 4 cm\n-1\n\n. \n\n \n\nBoth mine waters were analyzed before and after the experiments with respect to metal \n\nconcentration by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, \n\nVarian 725) or atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) (Perkin Elmer AAnalist 100). \n\nUnless otherwise stated, the detection limit for manganese was determined using the \n\nprocedure proposed by Os\u00f3rio Neto (1996) and was calculated to be 0.02 mg.L\n-1\n\n. \n\n \n\n2.3 - Modeling \n\n \n\nBatchwise sorption kinetic models have been extensively discussed in the literature, and a \n\nreview can be found in the work of Qiu et al. (2009). Here, this matter will be briefly \n\nreviewed.  \n\n \n\nManganese loading kinetics on limestone can be modeled according to the general \n\ndifferential equation \n\n \n\n? ?a\nte\n\ntq\n\ntq qqk\nd\n\nd\n??

The Bohart-Adams equation was applied in the Bed \n\nDepth Service Time (BDST) model. These models have also been reviewed (Singh et al., \n\n2009; Wolborska, 1989; Yan et al., 2001), and the corresponding equations are presented \n\nin Table 2.1. The Bohart-Adams model assumes that the sorption rate is controlled by \n\nsurface reaction, which is proportional to both the sorbent residual capacity and the \n\nadsorbent concentration (Calero et al., 2009). Thomas model assumes plug flow behavior \n\nin the solid bed; moreover, it also assumes that the sorption isotherm can be described by \n\n\n\n 21 \n\nthe Langmuir equation and that sorption kinetics is described by a second-order reversible \n\nequation. Therefore, this model is suitable for sorption processes that are not controlled by \n\nfilm or surface diffusion. The main assumption of the Yoon and Nelson model is that the \n\nrate of decrease in the sorption probability of each molecule is proportional to the \n\nprobability of sorbate sorption and that of sorbate breakthrough (Calero et al., 2009). \n\nWolborska (1989) aimed to model the low-concentration region of the breakthrough curve \n\nduring mass transfer control by either film or axial diffusion.  \n\n \n\nTable 2.1 - Model equations applied to predict breakthrough curves.  \n\nModel Equation Reference \n\nBohart-Adams  \n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n\ntkC\nU\n\nZkNC\n\nC\n\n0\n00 exp1\n\n1\n \n\nBohart-Adams (1920) \n\nThomas  \n??\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n\nQ\n\nVkC\n\nQ\n\nmkqC\n\nC\n\n000 exp1\n\n1\n \n\nThomas (1944) \n\nYoon and \n\nNelson  \n\n? ?\n? ?\n\n5.0\n\n5.0\n\n0\nexp1\n\nexp\n\ntktk\n\ntktk\n\nC\n\nC\n\nynyn\n\nynyn\n\n??\n\n?\n?  \n\nYoon and Nelson \n\n(1984) \n\nWolborska  \nU\n\nZ\nt\n\nN\n\nC\n\nC\n\nC\n\no\n\no ??\n???\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n0\n\nln  Wolborska (1989) \n\nDose-response  \na\n\nmq\n\nVCC\n\nC\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n??\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n1  \n\nYan et al., 2001 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe model applies to the linear part of a ln(C/C0) versus t curve in which both the \n\nadsorbate concentration in solution and at the sorbent at a determined level of the bed is \n\nconsidered constant and mass transfer is at a steady state. Finally, the modified Dose-\n\nresponse model is an empirical equation proposed by Yan et al. (2001) to model fixed-bed \n\nbiosorption, which was later applied to zinc (Senthilkumar et al., 2006) and chromium \n\n(Calero et al., 2009) removal in fixed-bed columns.  \n\n\n\n 22 \n\n2.4 - Results and discussions   \n\n \n\nIn this work, two approaches were studied to investigate manganese removal by limestone, \n\nnamely, (i) manganese sorption by finely powdered limestone in a stirred reactor and (ii) \n\nmanganese removal in fixed-bed columns.  \n\n \n\n2.4.1- Experiments in stirred tank with fine ground limestone \n\n \n\nPreliminary batch experiments using manganese-laden mining water (Table 2.2) were \n\ncarried out to verify the mass of fine powdered material (<45 mm, d50 = 8.6 \u00b5m) required \n\nfor metal removal (C0 = 1.5 mg.L\n-1\n\n), and the value of 4.2 g.L\n-1\n\n was chosen. This value \n\nenabled the manganese concentration to be reduced from 1.5 mg.L\n-1\n\n to 0.28 mg.L\n-1\n\n within \n\n60 minutes; this time was considered to be the residence time in the subsequent continuous \n\nexperiments.  \n\n \n\nAs shown in Table 2.2, in addition to sulfate, the low manganese mine water contained \n\n1.5 mg.L\n-1 \n\nmanganese while the high-manganese mine water contained 15.0 mg.L\n-1\n\n \n\nmanganese.  \n\n \n\nTable 2.2 - Mine water composition studied in this work.

Both manganese \n\nremoval and the pH increased with time. Within 60 minutes, the residual manganese \n\nconcentration reached 1.28 mg.L\n-1\n\n, and the solution pH was 8.6; after 300 min, the pH \n\nlevel increased to 8.8, and the manganese concentration was reduced to 0.1 mg.L\n-1\n\n; after 9 \n\nresidence times, the residual manganese concentration was 0.07 mg.L\n-1\n\n and this \n\ncorresponds to a loading of 0.34 mg Mn.g\n-1 \n\nlimestone. Franklin and Morse (1983) observed \n\nmanganese removal to be defined by the mass of limestone but not by the initial \n\nmanganese concentration. The authors also observed metal removals varying from 90 to \n\n99% from diluted manganese solutions (0.55 mg.L\n-1\n\n) whereas Silva et al. (2010) noticed \n\nthat by increasing the limestone mass in the pulp the residual manganese concentration \n\ndecreased. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 - Influence of time on manganese removal and pH from an industrial effluent \n\ncontaining 1.5 mg.L\n-1\n\n.

(m\n\ng\n.L\n\n-1)\n\nA    \n\nA \n\n\n\n 24 \n\nUnder similar experimental conditions, (1.64 L reactor, 60 minutes residence time and \n\n23\u00b12\no\nC), Silva et al. (2010) studied the effect of pH on manganese removal from mine \n\nwaters and observed 97% removal from a 15.0 mg.L\n-1\n\n manganese-containing mine water at \n\npH 8.3-8.5 in the presence of 20.8 g.L\n-1\n\n calcite limestone (0.77 mgMn.g\n-1 \n\nlimestone). \n\nTherefore, stirred-reactor sorption can be an option for treating mine waters containing low \n\nto moderate manganese concentrations, as was also pointed out by Rose et al. (2003) in a \n\nreview of AMD treatment with limestone.   \n\n \n\nIn addition to manganese, other metals present in the mine water were also removed from \n\nthe low manganese water as shown in Table 2.2. The sulfate concentration in particular \n\ndecreased from 564.0 mg.L\n-1\n\n to 12.0 mg.L\n-1\n\n, indicating the high sorption affinity between \n\nsulfate and limestone. This observation is consistent with the work of Silva et al. (2010), \n\nwhich revealed the presence of sulfate on a limestone surface after mixing with mine \n\nwater. Notwithstanding, this phenomenon is currently being investigated. \n\n \n\n2.4.2 - Experiments with the coarser limestone particles \n\n \n\nGiven the low manganese concentration in the mine water, fixed-bed sorption is also an \n\nalternative method of manganese removal because sorption is especially suitable for the \n\ntreatment of low-concentration effluents. In this regard, a series of experiments were \n\ncarried out with the two mine water samples (Table 2.2) and a coarser (590-850 \u00b5m) \n\nparticle size of the limestone particles.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 25 \n\n2.4.3 - Kinetics testing \n\n \n\nFirst, the manganese sorption kinetics in the coarser particle size fraction was assessed. \n\nFigure 2.2a depicts the influence of time on manganese removal in a batch system for both \n\nlow and high manganese mine waters. For the experiment carried out with 15.0 mg.L\n-1\n\n \n\nmanganese mine water, it can be observed in Figure 2.2a that a fast reduction in \n\nmanganese concentration occurred within the first 15 min, followed by a slower step \n\nbetween 15 min and 60 min and a third phase (60\u2013180 min), when the removal kinetics \n\nincrease again. Therefore, both the pseudofirst order and the pseudosecond order models \n\ncould not successfully describe the sorption kinetics. This is because such simple models \n\nsometimes cannot account for sorption on solid surfaces, which are usually \n\ninhomogeneous.

The different values for the rate constant characterize \n\nmanganese sorption as a multiple pseudofirst order process (Ho and McKay, 1999), \n\nrepresenting different sorption mechanisms. The first stage corresponds to the binding of \n\nmanganese atoms to the active sites on the adsorbent surface and manganese carbonate \n\nnucleation. Afterward, this manganese carbonate acts as a catalyst for further sorption on \n\nthe adsorbent surface (Franklin and Morse, 1983). This sorption mechanism will be \n\ndiscussed later in this work. \n\n \n\nFor the experiment with 1.5 mg.L\n-1\n\n, the sorption process was faster, and the rate constants \n\nwere increased to 4.98x10\n-3 \n\n  and 11.8x10\n-3\n\n L.g\n-1\n\n.min\n-1\n\n (r\n2\n = 0.95) for the first and second \n\nstages, respectively. These values are consistent with those found by Franklin and Morse \n\n(1983), who also observed that manganese sorption follows a pseudofirst order model with \n\na rate constant of 3.0 L.g\n-1\n\n.min\n-1\n\n. When both manganese concentrations are compared, for a \n\nten-fold increase in the manganese concentration, there is an approximately 50% reduction \n\nin the rate constant values. \n\n \n\n2.4.4 - Equilibrium experiments \n\n \n\nAfter defining the time required for sorption equilibrium, a pseudo-sorption isotherm was \n\nproduced so that the maximum sorption capacity could be determined (Figure 2.3). The \n\nsorption process can be described by both the Freundlich (r\n2\n = 0.98) and Langmuir \n\n(r\n2 \n\n= 0.98) models. From the latter equation, maximum manganese loading of \n\n0.91 mgMn.mg\n-1 \n\nlimestone was achieved on the coarse limestone fraction. McBride (1979) \n\nstudied manganese sorption on fine limestone (0.49 m\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n surface area) and found a \n\n\n\n 27 \n\nmaximum uptake value of 0.0034 mg.g\n-1\n\n, whereas Aziz et al. (2008) observed limestone \n\nloadings varying from 0.012 mg.g\n-1\n\n (Zn) to 0.038 mg.g\n-1\n\n (Ni) while studying Cu, Zn, Ni, \n\nPb, Cd and Cr(III) on limestone. These values are lower than that observed for manganese \n\nsorption on zeolites (7.1 mg.g\n-1\n\n), for instance (Taffarel and Rubio, 2009). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 - Manganese sorption isotherm at 23\u00b12\no\nC and pH 6.5. \n\n \n\n2.4.5 - Fixed-bed experiments \n\n \n\nFixed-bed experiments were performed to study the effects of bed height, flow rate and \n\ninitial metal concentration on manganese sorption by limestone.

As the bed height increased \n\nfrom 15 cm to 25 cm, the breakthrough curves changed from being steep to being flatter \n\nand concave. The evolution of the breakthrough curve of the longer bed (25 cm) was \n\nparticularly gradual, meaning that the column was difficult to exhaust completely. The \n\n20 cm length bed seems to produce a suitable S shape; thus, the optimum length to \n\ndiameter ratio for manganese sorption in a fixed-bed column should not be higher than 10.  \n\n \n\nThe effect of flow rate (1 mL.min\n-1\n\n \u2013 3 min.min\n-1\n\n) on the breakthrough curve can be \n\nobserved in Table 2.3 for a bed length of 20 cm and initial manganese concentrations of \n\n1.5 and 15 mg.L\n-1\n\n. For decreasing flow rates, the breakthrough time tb and therefore the \n\nbreakthrough volume Vb (volume of solution treated at the breakthrough point), increase, \n\nas was observed by Haghsheno et al. (2009) and Hussain et al. (2007). This is due to an \n\n\n\n 29 \n\nincrease in the Empty Bed Contact Time (EBCT), Table 2.3, because the front of the \n\nsorption zone reaches the top of the column later at smaller flow rates (Cooney, 1999). \n\nThus, the breakthrough time decreased from 120 min to 90 min and the saturation time \n\nfrom 390 min to 340 min when the flow rate increased from 1 to 3 mL.min\n-1\n\n in the \n\nexperiments with 1.5 mgMn.L\n-1\n\n (C0) and a 20 cm bed.  \n\n \n\nHigher initial manganese concentrations (15 mg.L\n-1\n\n) resulted in earlier breakthrough points \n\n(Figure 2.4c), and tb values were reduced from 63 min to 9 when the flow rate increased; \n\ntherefore, the saturation time was also reduced from 312 min (1 mL.min\n-1\n\n) to 50 min \n\n(3 mL.min\n-1\n\n) (Table 2.3). This result indicates the faster exhaustion of sorption sites and \n\ntherefore bed saturation. At this initial concentration, a slight difference is observed in the \n\nbreakthrough curves when the flow rate is changed from 2 mL.min\n-1\n\n to 3 mL.min\n-1\n\n. \n\nFurthermore, the mass transfer zone (MTZ, Table 2.3) represents at least 70% of the bed \n\nheight. \n\n\n\n 30 \n\nTable 2.3 - Experimental values for fixed-bed manganese sorption by limestone under different conditions. \n\n \n\nZ Q C0 Limestone U Nb tb Vb te Ve t0.5 EBCT  AUR MTZ \n\n(cm) (mL.min\n-1\n\n) (mg.L\n-1\n\n) mass (cm.min\n-1\n\n)   (min) (mL) (min) (mL) (min) (min) \n(g.mL\n\n-1\n) \n\n  \n\n10 1 1.5 38.57 0.32 2.85 104.2 104.2 324 324.0 211.9 31.42 0.43 7.24 \n15 1 1.5 56.14 0.32 3.08 145.3 145.3 291 291.0 218.2 47.12 0.39 7.51 \n20 1 1.5 87.18 0.32 1.94 162.3 162.3 386.1 386.1 259.6 62.83 0.71 13.68 \n25 1 1.5 98.71 0.32 1.68 111.43 111.43 438.2 438.2 275.8 78.54 0.75 17.49 \n\n20 2 1.5 87.18 0.64 2.98 93.7 187.4 327.3 654.6 210.5 31.42 0.47 14.27 \n10 3 1.5 38.57 0.96 5.90 66.15 198.45 258.5 775.5 163.4 10.47 0.21 7.61 \n15 3 1.5 56.14 0.96 5.04 80.30 240.9 261.4 784.2 171 15.71 0.24 10.46 \n20 3 1.5 87.18 0.96 4.19 96.22 288.66 338.7 1016.1 218 20.94 0.33 14.82 \n25 3 1.5 98.71 0.96 3.92 88.17 264.51 338.4 1015.2 239.4 26.18 0.32 17.41 \n20 1 15 87.18 0.32 1.00 63 63 312.5 380.0 196.0 62.83 1.38 16.68 \n20 2 15 87.18 0.64 0.16 5 10 75 100.0 34.7 31.42 8.72 19.00 \n20 3 15 87.18 0.96 0.48 9 27 50 750.0 18.7 20.94 2.91 19.28 \n\n\n\n 31  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.6 - Breakthrough modeling \n\n \n\nTo model the breakthrough curves produced during manganese sorption by calcite limestone, \n\nthe following models were applied: (i) Bed Depth Service Time (BDST); (ii) Thomas; (iii) \n\nYoon and Nelson, (iv) Wolborska and (v) the Dose-response. The last model is an empirical \n\nequation that is widely used in biosorption studies (Calero et al., 2009; Senthilkumar et al., \n\n2006).  \n\n \n\nFrom the Bohart-Adams equation (Table 2.1), the Bed Depth Service Time (BDST) model is \n\ndeveloped when that equation is linearized to produce the following:  \n\n \n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n\n?\n? 1ln\n\n1 0\n\n00\n\n0\n\nC\n\nC\n\nkCUC\n\nZN\nt                                                   (2.4) \n\n \n\nAt 50% breakthrough, C0/C = 2 and therefore \n\nUC\n\nZN\nt\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5.0\n                                                                  (2.5) \n\n \n\nEquation 2.5 shows that the sorptive capacity of the bed (N0) is directly proportional to its \n\nheight (Z) at 50% breakthrough; thus, N0 can be calculated from the slope in a plot of t0.5 \n\nversus Z, and a straight line passing through the origin is expected. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 shows the BDST plot for the removal of manganese for bed heights varying from \n\n10 to 25 cm at both 5% and 50% breakthrough time and different flow rates. The bed sorption \n\ncapacity was calculated from the slope of the 50% breakthrough plot as 2.24x10\n-3\n\n mg.mL\n-1 \n\nin \n\nthe experiments performed at 1 mL.min\n-1\n\n. As the flow rate increased to 3 mL.min\n-1\n\n, the bed \n\n\n\n 32  \n\n \n\n \n\nsorption capacity increased to 7.92x10\n-3\n\n mg.mL\n-1\n\n. The bed capacity was also determined for \n\n5% breakthrough and values corresponding to 1.38x10\n-3\n\n mg.mL\n-1\n\n and 3.78x10\n-3\n\n mg.mL\n-1\n\n \n\nwere observed at flow rates of 1 mL.min\n-1\n\n and 3 mL.min\n-1\n\n, respectively. The sorption rate \n\nconstant could be determined from the 5% breakthrough plot, and equation 2.4 predicts that \n\nthe intercept should be a negative value.  \n\n \n\n              \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 - Time for breakthrough compared to bed length for manganese sorption on a \n\nlimestone surface according to the BDST model. C0 = 1.5 mg.L\n-1\n\n Mn\n2+\n\n, pH 8.0; 1mL.min\n-1\n\n (a) \n\ne 3.0 mLmin\n-1\n\n (b).  \n\n \n\nAs shown Figure 2.5, the intercepts at both 1 and 3 mL.min\n-1\n\n are positive, which is a violation \n\nof the BDST theory. Therefore, the rate constant was not determined applying the BDST \n\ntheory. Along with the fact that the linear plot does not pass through the origin, it is postulated \n\nthat manganese sorption on limestone is complex (Srivastava et al., 2008). Nevertheless, \n\ncomparing the intercepts at 5% breakthrough, this parameter is reduced (from +61.5 to +36.9) \n\nfor increasing flow rates, which suggests that mass transfer in the fluid is more important than \n\nin the solid phase; otherwise, the observed intercept values would not be significantly affected \n\nby changes in the flow rate, as discussed by Cooney (1999). This might be likely ascribed to \n\n\n\n 33  \n\n \n\n \n\nthe low surface area of the limestone sample, which does not present significant porosity; \n\ntherefore, sorption on the external surface seems to be more important than on pore walls. \n\nFigures 2.6-2.8 present the experimental and theoretical breakthrough curves for the \n\nexperiments performed with both low and high manganese mine water samples. In addition, \n\nTables 2.4 and 2.5 depict the values achieved by fitting equations 2-5 (Table 2.1) to the \n\nexperimental data. With the exception of the Wolborska model (Table 2.5), all equations \n\nproduced good correlation coefficients between the theoretical and the experimental data \n\n(r\n2\n?0.99) when the low manganese water was studied (1.5 mg.L\n\n-1\n).  \n\n \n\nThe Thomas equation reproduces the sorption process fairly accurately at low manganese \n\nconcentrations (Figure 2.6).

Similarly, at the same bed depth (20 cm), when the influent flow rate increased, \n\nthe volumetric bed capacity also increased from 0.005 mgMn.mL\n-1 \n\nbed (1 mL.min\n-1\n\n) to \n\n0.013 mgMn.mL\n-1 \n\nbed (3 mL.min\n-1\n\n). Furthermore, the higher inlet concentration (15.0 mg.L\n-1\n\n) \n\nenabled a better utilization of the limestone sorption capacity as higher bed and particle \n\nloadings were achieved (at lower flow rates) compared with those of the low-manganese \n\nwater (Table 2.4). The values predicted by the Thomas equation are larger than those \n\nproduced by the BDST model because the former calculates loading from the whole area \n\nabove the breakthrough curve whereas the latter determines bed loading only for either 5% or \n\n50% breakthrough. \n\n \n\nNevertheless, manganese sorption in limestone is small and decreased from 0.033 to \n\n0.010 mgMn.g\n-1 \n\nlimestone for 15.0 mg.L\n-1\n\n Mn\n2+ \n\n(C0) mine water when the flow rate increased. \n\nSimilar flow rate effects were observed by Singh et al. in studying furfural sorption by \n\nactivated carbon (2009). Kinetic factors account for the smaller uptakes observed in the \n\ncolumn experiments with respect to the values predicted by the isotherm presented in \n\nFigure 2.2 due to short mean residence times. \n\n \n\nThe values of the rate constant kYN and the time required for 50% sorbate breakthrough (t0.5) \n\nachieved from fitting the Yoon and Nelson model to the experimental data can be observed in \n\nTable 2.5.

For the experiments performed with the high manganese mine water (15 mg.L\n-1\n\n), \n\na slightly worse fitting was observed, especially for the experiments performed at 3 mL.min\n-1\n\n.  \n\n \n\nThe Wolborska model in particular did not produce good fittings to the experimental data \n\nwith the 15 mgMn.L\n-1\n\n mine water, and the predicted bed manganese loadings were different \n\nfrom those predicted by the Thomas model (Table 2.5). The ? parameter in the Wolborska \n\nmodel reflects the effect of both mass transfers in the liquid phase and axial dispersion during \n\nmanganese sorption on limestone (Srivastava et al., 2008; Wolborska, 1989). The observed ? \n\nvalues decreased with the bed length (same flow rate), implying an increased resistance to \n\nmass transfer in the liquid phase. Moreover, because axial dispersion can be neglected in \n\nliquid phase systems (Cooney, 1999), the increasing of ? with flow rate is also consistent with \n\nfilm diffusion control, especially at lower manganese concentrations (1.5 mg.L\n-1\n\n).  \n\n \n\n2.5 - Manganese uptake characterization \n\n \n\n \n\nThe determination of the zeta potential enabled the assessment of the sorption mechanisms. \n\nFigure 2.9 presents the zeta potential data for calcite limestone as a function of pH. The \n\nisoelectric point (IEP) of the raw sample is 9.8, which is consistent with the values reported \n\nelsewhere (Morse, 1986; Salinas-Nolasco et al., 2004; Somasundaran and Agar, 1967). \n\nDuring the column experiments, the pH increased to values above 8.15, thus electrostatic \n\ninteraction between the negatively charged limestone surface and Mn\n2+\n\n as well as specific \n\ninteractions between manganese and the carbonate (or hydroxide) ions on the limestone \n\nsurface may account for sorption in the fixed-bed column. \n\n\n\n 39  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9 - Zeta potential measurements for limestone used in the experiments \n\n \n\n \n\nThe solid residue produced during the experiments using the low-manganese water was \n\ncharacterized by infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy \n\ndispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Figure 2.10a shows an image of the surface of the \n\nresidue alongside manganese mapping. The figure shows that manganese is distributed \n\nthroughout the limestone surface and is not concentrated in a particular site, suggesting a \n\npossible adsorption mechanism. Figure 2.10b shows the spectrum of a selected point in \n\nFigure 10a as determined by dispersive X-ray energy. The presence of copper can be \n\nobserved, which can be explained by its presence in the mine water (Table 2.2). Manganese is \n\nnot observed in the EDS spectrum because of its dispersion on the limestone surface \n\n(Figure 2.10a). \n\n \n\n6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13\n\n-20\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nLimestone\n\nZ\ne\n\nta\n p\n\no\nte\n\nn\nti\na\n\nl \n(m\n\nV\n)\n\npH\n\n\n\n 40  \n\n \n\n \n\na  b \n\n \n\nFigure 2.10 - SEM image of manganese loaded limestone (a) and EDS spectra (b) from the \n\nlow manganese mine water (1.5 mg.L\n-1\n\n), 4.2 g.L\n-1\n\n  of limestone (d50 = 8.6 \u00b5m), pH 8.0 and \n\n23\u00b12\u00b0C. \n\n \n\nInfrared spectroscopy was also applied to characterize this residue. Figure 2.11 shows the \n\nspectra obtained for limestone before and after contact with the low manganese water. The \n\nspectrum of a sample of pure manganese carbonate is shown for comparison. For pure calcite \n\nlimestone, a characteristic band assigned to the C=O shift is observed at 712 cm\n-1\n\n.  \n\n\n\n 41  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.11 - IR spectra for calcite limestone, pure manganese carbonate and manganese \n\nsorbed limestone. \n\n \n\nThis absorption band is observed at 724 cm\n-1\n\n for pure manganese carbonate. For the \n\nmanganese-sorbed limestone, in addition to the C=O band at 712 cm\n-1\n\n (limestone), a smaller \n\nIR shift is observed at 728 cm\n-1\n\n, which can be ascribed to manganese carbonate formation \n\nover the limestone surface. These observations are supported by Nassrallah-Aboukais et al. \n\n(1998), who found a characteristic band for rhodocrosite at 726 cm\n-1\n\n, as well as by Makreski \n\nand Jovanovski (2003), who observed for kutnahorite (CaMnMg(CO3)2) C=O shifts at \n\n712 cm\n-1 \n\nand 722 cm\n-1\n\n assigned to CaCO3 and MnCO3, respectively. Similarly, Silva (2010) \n\nobserved the characteristics bands for limestone at 712 cm\n-1\n\n and 729 cm\n-1\n\n, which were \n\nassigned to the presence of manganese carbonate (MnCO3) on the limestone surface, \n\nsupporting the findings of this work. \n\n \n\n680 700 720 740 760\n\n724\n\n712\n\n728\n\n712\n\nLimestone + effluent\n\nMnCO\n3\n(p.a)\n\nLimestone\n\nWavenumber (cm\n-1\n)\n\n\n\n 42  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe presence of manganese carbonate on limestone surfaces has been proposed by different \n\nauthors. Blanchard and Baer (1992) proposed that the Mn\n2+\n\n ion is incorporated in calcium \n\ncarbonate, forming a CaCO3-MnCO3 solution. Zachara et al. (1991) also suggested solid \n\nsolution formation and included chemical sorption and precipitation on limestone surfaces as \n\npotential mechanisms. Metals with ionic radii smaller than the radius of calcium (0.99 \u00c5), \n\nsuch as manganese (0.80 \u00c5) for example, can form solid solutions with limestone. The \n\nauthors suggested an exchange reaction on limestone surfaces (equation 2.6), which could \n\nalso explain the results observed during manganese sorption from mining water on fine \n\npowered limestone.  \n\n \n\nCa\n2+ \n\n(surface) + Me\n2+\n\n(aq)  ? Me (surface) + Ca\n2+ \n\n(aq)                                (2.6) \n\n \n\nThe results suggest that manganese can be sorbed by calcite limestone; however, low loading \n\ncapacities are expected. Manganese removal can be improved if particle size is reduced, and \n\nsorption can be carried out in stirred reactors instead of fixed-bed columns. \n\n \n\n2.6 - Conclusions \n\n \n\nLimestone can be applied for manganese sorption from mine waters. Equilibrium sorption can \n\nbe described by either Freundlich or Langmuir equations, resulting in a maximum uptake of \n\n0.91 mg.g\n-1\n\n limestone. The sorption kinetics can be divided into two steps, both following a \n\npseudo-first-order model with rate constant values varying from 2.2x10\n-3\n\n L.(min.g)\n-1\n\n to \n\n11.8x10\n-3\n\n L.(min.g)\n-1\n\n. The Thomas, Yoon and Nelson and Dose-response models were \n\nsuitable in describing the observed sorption behavior. The Wolborska model showed a poor \n\nfit with the experimental data, especially for the high-manganese mine water. FTIR showed \n\n\n\n 43  \n\n \n\n \n\nthe presence of manganese carbonate on the limestone surface, and the zeta potential \n\nsuggested that the limestone surface is negatively charged during sorption. Metal uptake was \n\nlow and increased with flow rate for the low-manganese mine water but decreased when the \n\nmetal concentration in the solution was high (15 mg.L\n-1\n\n). During fixed-bed experiments, \n\nmaximum uptake (0.057 mg.mL\n-1 \n\nbed) was observed for 15 mgMn.L\n-1\n\n at the lower flow rate \n\n(1 mL.min\n-1\n\n). The BDST model confirmed low manganese uptake at breakthrough, but \n\nalternatively manganese can also be removed in stirred reactors.  \n\n \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\n \n\n \n\nThe financial support from the funding agencies FINEP, FAPEMIG, CNPq and CAPES is \n\ngratefully appreciated.

Metal carbonate can be an effective way \n\nfor its removal, as manganese carbonate has been detected in net alkaline mine waters. \n\nHowever, limestone is effective in removing manganese only if the metal content is low. This \n\nwork sought to study manganese precipitation from high manganese (140 mg.L\n-1\n\n) mine \n\nwaters applying sodium carbonate and limestone mixtures. It was observed that besides total \n\ncarbonate concentration, pH plays a key role on manganese carbonate formation. Provided the \n\npH solution is above 8.5, 99.9% manganese removal can be achieved with carbonate ions. \n\nAlthough not required for manganese precipitation, limestone acts as a solid substrate for the \n\nnucleation of fine manganese carbonate grains. Infrared spectroscopy showed manganese \n\ncarbonate precipitation on the limestone surface. Magnesium was also removed from the mine \n\nwater but magnesium carbonate formation was not observed.   \n\n \n\nKey-words: manganese removal; mine water; sodium carbonate; limestone; manganese \n\ncarbonate. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 49  \n\n \n\n \n\n3.1 \u2013 Introduction \n\n \n\n \n\nManganese is a toxic element usually found in the effluents of many industries, as well as in \n\nmine waters, either neutral or acid (AMD). AMD is produced from the oxidation of sulfide \n\nminerals as a result of exposure to both oxygen and water during the mining and processing of \n\nmetal sulfides and coal [1]. Besides manganese, the large content of other elements (mainly \n\niron, aluminium, sulphate and other dissolved materials during acid attack on the mining \n\ntailings) found in the AMD is also a concern. Most of these elements can be removed by just \n\nincreasing drainage pH, which is achieved usually by lime addition. Since metal solubility is \n\nreduced as pH increases, lime is able to reduce metal concentrations and enables drainage \n\ncompliance with environmental regulations. Metal sulfide precipitation is also applied to \n\nremove the transition metal elements, since the residual metal concentrations are very low [2, \n\n3]. Nevertheless, neither lime nor sulfide ions are effective in removing manganese, as this \n\nelement is soluble over a wide pH range and very difficult to remove from contaminated \n\nwaters; requiring pH above 11 for an effective removal as hydroxide [4].       \n\n \n\n \n\nMn\n2+\n\n oxidation and precipitation as MnO2 followed by clarification is also an alternative to \n\ntreat manganese-containing drainages. Chemical oxidation can be performed by aeration or \n\napplying strong oxidizing agents, such as potassium permanganate, hypochlorite or ozone [5]. \n\nNotwithstanding, the presence of both ferrous iron and organic matter increases oxidant \n\nconsumption so that iron removal is required prior to manganese oxidation [6, 7]. Biological \n\nprocesses are an alternative, specially in low manganese waters [8]. The metal can also be \n\nprecipitated as carbonate, since manganese-bearing carbonate minerals such as rhodochrosite \n\n(MnCO3) and kutnahorite (CaMn(CO3)2), have been identified in mine affected waters; thus \n\n\n\n 50  \n\n \n\n \n\nmaterials capable of releasing CO3\n2-\n\n or HCO3\n- \nanions have application potential. Kutnahorite \n\nprecipitation was detected in mine waters with a  high content of dissolved calcium, \n\nmagnesium, manganese and CO2 and its precipitation was enhanced by higher pH values [9]. \n\nIt is also proposed that dissolved manganese could precipitate as MnCO3, replacing calcium \n\nin calcite or co-precipitating with the latter, provided there is supersaturation with respect to \n\nboth calcite and rhodochrosite [10]. \n\n \n\nLimestone is the most common neutralizing agent for acid waters [11] due to its availability \n\n[12] and low-cost in many countries and it is likely to be either the first option for metal \n\nremoval from many wastewaters or be combined with other treatment technologies such as \n\nsulfate reduction [13]. In addition, dissolved carbonate is paramount for manganese carbonate \n\nformation; otherwise manganese oxy-hydroxides are produced as already observed in mine \n\nwaters [10]. Previous work on manganese uptake by limestone showed efficient removal for \n\nlow to moderate manganese concentrations (16 mg.L\n-1\n\n), as well as the presence of manganese \n\ncarbonate on the limestone surface [5]. Bamforth et al. [14] studied manganese (~3 mg.L\n-1\n\n) \n\nremoval from a mine water with a total alkalinity of 3 meq.L\n-1\n\n by dolomite, limestone, \n\nmagnesite and quartzite. Besides this, the authors observed kutnahorite formation on \n\nquartizite while magnesium-rich calcites were identified in the dolomite and magnesite \n\nreactors, suggesting that the magnesium from the substrate minerals may have inhibited \n\nmanganese carbonate formation. The authors concluded that the nature of the solid substrate \n\ndoes not affect manganese removal. \n\n \n\nWhen alkalinity is not sufficient for manganese precipitation, soluble carbonate sources can \n\nbe added to the reacting system. Zhang et al. [15] studied manganese removal with sodium \n\ncarbonate (Na2CO3) from effluents produced in hydrometallurgical operations. From a \n\n\n\n 51  \n\n \n\n \n\n1.76 g.L\n-1\n\n Mn solution at pH 5.9, manganese precipitation occurred at pH above 7.5, reaching \n\n90 % at pH 8.0. Higher removals could have been achieved provided pH was further \n\nincreased. In addition, mineral carbonates such as limestone have been shown to affect the \n\nmanganese precipitation pathway, hindering manganese carbonate formation. Accordingly, \n\nthis work was undertaken to assess the effects of both soluble carbonate and limestone on \n\nmanganese removal from mine water with high manganese content.    \n\n \n\n3.2 \u2013 Experimental \n\n \n\nA calcite limestone sample assaying 39.5% calcium and 1.23% magnesium was kindly \n\nprovided by Brazilian producers. This sample was first sieved and subsequently dry ground in \n\na vibrating cup mill (Pulverisette 9, Fritsch) and had its particle size distribution assessed by \n\nlaser diffraction (CILAS - 1064), which showed d50 and d90 values of  5.6 \u00b5m and 18 \u00b5m, \n\nrespectively. The limestone surface area (1.52 m\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n) was measured by the N2 adsorption \n\nmethod (Quantachrome Nova 1000). \n\n \n\nManganese removal experiments were carried out with synthetic solutions as well as with \n\nmine water. Part of the batch experiments were performed with calcite limestone mixed with \n\nsodium carbonate (Na2CO3); the other part being performed with a mixture of bicarbonate \n\n(NaHCO3) and sodium hydroxide. Synthetic solutions containing 140-2000 mg.L\n-1\n\n \n\nmanganese (MnCl2.4H2O) prepared at pH 2.3-6.5 were studied. The experiments were \n\ncompleted with mine water assaying 140.0 mg.L\n-1\n\n manganese (at pH 6.5). A volume of \n\n120 mL solution (synthetic or mine water) was transferred to 250 mL erlenmeyer flasks and \n\nmixed with different limestone (4.2 to 20.8 g.L\n-1\n\n) and sodium carbonate amounts (0.39 to \n\n0.92 g.L\n-1\n\n). The flasks were kept under agitation (450 min\n-1\n\n), during 90 minutes and at \n\n\n\n 52  \n\n \n\n \n\n23\u00b12\no\nC. When the experiments were finished, the pH value was recorded (Handylab 1, \n\nschott), the solid phase was filtered and the aqueous solution was analyzed for manganese. \n\nThe effect of time on manganese precipitation was determined in a 2.0 L open erlenmeyer \n\nflask where 1.5 L manganese solution was mixed with both limestone (12.5 g.L\n-1\n\n) and \n\ncalcium carbonate (0.67 g.L\n-1\n\n), at pH 6.5 (initial value). This flask was stirred at 450 min\n-1\n\n, \n\n23\u00b12\no\nC and samples were withdrawn at every 5 minutes for manganese determination.  \n\n \n\nContinuous experiments were carried out in a stirred reactor with a 1.67 L capacity, at \n\n23\u00b12\no\nC. The latter was fed separately with (i) a 140 mg.L\n\n-1\n manganese-bearing mine water or \n\nsynthetic manganese solutions and (ii) a blend made up of limestone (12.5 g.L\n-1\n\n)\n    \n\nand sodium \n\ncarbonate (0.67 g.L\n-1\n\n). One experiment was carried out with only sodium carbonate (same \n\nconcentration); that is, in the absence of limestone. The stirring rate was set at 1200 min\n-1\n\n and \n\npumping was provided by two peristaltic pumps (Milan 628); one feeding the manganese \n\nsolution at 24.0 mL.min\n-1\n\n and the second, the limestone sodium carbonate (4.0 mL.min\n-1\n\n). \n\nResidence time was set at 60 minutes and experiments ran for at least 9 residence times to \n\nensure steady state conditions. After every 60 minutes, an aliquot was withdrawn from the \n\nreactor, filtered and the manganese content and pH were determined. The solid residue was \n\npreserved for further analysis (MEV-EDS and Infrared spectrophotometry). Prior to and \n\nduring the experiments, the mine water was stored in plastic containers at room temperature. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.1 \u2013 Characterization \n\n \n\n \n\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the morphology of the \n\nprecipitates. The samples were coated with graphite by electro-deposition, using a JEOL JEE \n\n4C instrument. They were then investigated by a JEOL JSM 5510 scanning electron \n\n\n\n 53  \n\n \n\n \n\nmicroscope (SEM), with an accelerating voltage 0.5 \u2013 30 kV, equipped with a spectrometer \n\nfor micro-analysis based on an energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy system (EDS). \n\n \n\nInfrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyzes were carried out in a Nicolet Nexus 470 model \n\nspectrophotometer, equipped with a Centaurus microscope, an attenuated total reflectance \n\n(ATR) apparatus (Thermo) and a ZnSe internal reflection devise. Medium infrared \n\nmeasurements were produced with a KBr bean splitter and an HgCdTe detector. The samples \n\nwere pressed against a flat glass surface and mounted under the ATR apparatus. The spectra \n\nwere collected in the 400-4000 cm\n-1 \n\nregion with a minimum of 32 scans at 4 cm\n-1 \n\nresolution. \n\n \n\nThe mine water was analyzed, before and during the experiments, for metals by inductively \n\ncoupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Varian 725) or atomic absorption \n\nspectrometry (AAS) (Perkin Elmer AAnalisty 100). \n\n \n\n3.3 - Results and discussions \n\n \n\n \n\nThe cleaner production principles applied to the mine waters include: (i) reducing the \n\nproduction of contaminated mine waters and (ii) recycling and reuse. Specifically, improving \n\neffluent quality and optimizing the treatment process so as to comply with the effluent \n\nregulations are two of the most applied approaches [16]. In this regard, manganese removal is \n\ncurrently one of the greatest challenges. \n\n \n\nThe mine water was analyzed, before and during the experiments, for metals by  ICP-OES or \n\nAAS and the results are depicted in Table 3.1.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 54  \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3.1 - Mine water composition before and after continuous manganese removal \n\nexperiments, 12.5 g.L\n-1\n\n CaCO3, 0.67 g.L\n-1\n\n Na2CO3. \n\n \n\nElement \n\n(mg.L\n-1\n\n) \n\nConcentrations before Mn \n\nremoval (mg.L\n-1\n\n) \n\nConcentrations after Mn \n\nremoval (mg.L\n-1\n\n) \n\nCa 85.6 83.10 \n\nMg 90.0 21.3 \n\nNa 4.07 7.72 \n\nS 306.0 88.60 \n\nNi 0.62 0.043 \n\nZn 0.78 0.075 \n\nCr 0.05 0.026 \n\nCu 0.22 0.029 \n\nFe 2.20 0.73 \n\nMn \n\npH \n\n140.0 \n\n6.5 \n\n<LD \n\n8.6 \n\nDL: Detention limit: 0.04 mg.L\n-1\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMajor constituents were manganese (140.0 mg.L\n-1\n\n), magnesium (90.0 mg.L\n-1\n\n) and sulphate \n\n(918.0 mg.L\n-1\n\n) while minor elements were iron (2.2 mg.L\n-1\n\n), copper (0.22 mg.L\n-1\n\n) and zinc \n\n(0.78 mg.L\n-1\n\n). \n\n \n\nManganese can be removed from both mine waters and industrial wastewaters as different \n\ncompounds and the form of removal is defined by the water chemistry, specially pH and Eh \n\nvalues. In oxidizing conditions, manganese oxy-hydroxides are formed, while manganese \n\nbearing carbonate minerals, such as rhodochrosite (MnCO3) and kutnahorite (CaMn(CO3)2), \n\nare observed to precipitate naturally in the presence of carbonate ions, if the pH is above the \n\n7-8 region. Figure 3.1 presents manganese solubility when considering the precipitation of \n\neither manganese carbonate or hydroxide.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 55  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 - Manganese carbonate and hydroxide solubility as function of pH at 25\no\nC and \n\nI ?0. [CO3]tot represents total dissolved carbonate species.  \n\n \n\n \n\nManganese carbonate solubility was calculated by equation 3.1, presented by Lloyd et al. \n\n[17], which includes MnHCO3\n- \nand MnOH\n\n+\n complexes on the manganese solubility as well as \n\nthe total carbonate concentration. This equation was shown to predict fairly accurately \n\naqueous manganese concentrations in equilibrium with manganese carbonate [17]. Also \n\nincluded in Figure 3.1 is the theoretical manganese hydroxide solubility at 25\no\nC and I ?0. For \n\n10\n-3 \n\nmol.L\n-1\n\n dissolved carbonate concentrations and pH values above 8, the manganese \n\nconcentration is reduced to values below 10\n-5 \n\nmol.L\n-1\n\n.   \n\n \n\nTo achieve the same residual metal concentration, a pH value of 10 or higher is required when \n\nhydroxide precipitation is used. Therefore, carbonate precipitation ensures lower residual \n\nmanganese concentrations in neutral pH values as compared to metal hydroxide removal. This \n\nobservation is consistent with the findings of Dayube [18], who stated that alkalinity is one of \n\nthe most cost-effective methods for manganese removal from mine waters. Another outcome \n\nfrom Figure 3.1 is that carbonate precipitation enables easier compliance with environmental \n\n6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13\n\n10\n-7\n\n10\n-4\n\n10\n-1\n\n10\n2\n\nMn(OH)\n2\n\n[CO\n3\n]\n\ntot\n = 10\n\n-3\nmol/L\n\n[CO\n3\n]\n\ntot\n = 1mol/LM\n\nn\n2\n\n+\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\nm\no\n\nl/\nL\n\n)\n\npH\n\n\n\n 56  \n\n \n\n \n\nregulations, as most countries define pH 9 as the maximum allowable value for effluent (or \n\nmine water) discharge. \n\n \n\n[        ]  \n[  ]    \n\n       \n \n\n       \n\n[  ]\n     [ \n\n ]                                          (3.1) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWhere [H\n+\n] is the hydrogen ion concentration; Ct, total dissolved carbonic species; Ksp, the \n\nsolubility product constant, KII and KIII the equilibrium constants of equations 3.2 and 3.3, \n\nrespectively; Ka,2, is the H2CO3 second dissociation constant and Kw, the ionic product of \n\nwater.   \n\n \n\n \n\nMnCO3 + H\n+\n ?

Experimental conditions: 140.0 mg.L\n-1\n\n \n\ninitial pH 6.5, 23\u00b12\n?\nC. \n\n \n\n \n\nThis is due to the manganese sorption on calcium carbonate as observed in a previous work \n\ncarried out by Silva et al. [5]. The authors also observed a pH increase during manganese \n\nremoval by limestone and determined that 1.28 mgMn\n2+\n\n.g\n-1\n\n limestone was the maximum \n\nloading in continuous experiments. \n\n \n\nUnlike powdered limestone, sodium carbonate precipitates manganese extensively \n\n(Figure 3.2b), as expected. In the presence of 0.67 g.L\n-1\n\n sodium carbonate, the solution\u2019s pH \n\nreaches 9.6 and the manganese concentration is reduced to values below the detection limit \n\nwith the synthetic solution. Lower carbonate concentrations produce smaller final pH values \n\nand thus higher residual manganese concentrations in the aqueous phase as demonstrated in \n\nFigure 3.1. These results are consistent with the studies carried out by Zhang et al. [15] during \n\nmanganese removal from effluents produced in hydrometallurgical operations, which also \n\nobserved that a pH value above 8.0 is needed to produce residual manganese concentrations \n\n\n\n 58  \n\n \n\n \n\nbelow 1 mg.L\n-1\n\n. Similarly, Costa and Teixeira [19] observed smaller residual manganese \n\nconcentrations for increasing pH values. \n\n \n\nThe effect of time on manganese removal is shown in Figure 3.3 for experiments comprising \n\nthe application of 12.5 g.L\n-1\n\n limestone mixed with either different carbonate sources or \n\nsodium hydroxide. It can be observed that calcium carbonate reduces the manganese \n\nconcentration to 124 mg.L\n-1\n\n, within 100 minutes; that is, only 11% of the manganese was \n\nremoved from the solution. When stoichiometrical concentrations of sodium bicarbonate \n\n(0.21 g.L\n-1\n\n) are mixed with a 140 mg.L\n-1\n\n manganese solution, only a minor effect on metal \n\nremoval (15%) was noticed and the final manganese concentration reached 120 mg.L\n-1\n\n, which \n\nis similar to the value observed when only calcium carbonate was applied. When the Na2CO3 \n\nconcentration is increased to 0.67 mg.L\n-1\n\n, manganese concentration is reduced to 81.8 mg.L\n-1\n\n \n\nfor a final pH value of 8.0. This behavior should be compared to the experiments carried out \n\nwith sodium carbonate (Figure 3.4). With 0.26 g.L\n-1\n\n Na2CO3 (stoichiometrical amount to \n\nprecipitate 140 mg.L\n-1\n\n Mn\n2+\n\n), removal efficiency is improved to 47 % and the manganese \n\nconcentration is reduced to 74.7 mg.L\n-1\n\n. For the optimum value defined in Figure 3.2b, the \n\nresidual manganese concentration in solution is below the detection limit; in other words, \n\n100% removal was achieved. Figure 3.3 also shows the effect of pH on the aqueous \n\nmanganese concentration. After 100 minutes, residual metal concentration is 6.5 mg.L\n-1\n\n when \n\nthe pH is maintained in 10 with NaOH. With sodium hydroxide, manganese is removed as \n\nmanganese hydroxide, which is more soluble than manganese carbonate (the expected species \n\nin the presence of high carbonate concentrations). \n\n \n\n\n\n 59  \n\n \n\n \n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\nNaHCO\n3\n - 0.67g/L\n\n      pH=8.0\n\nNaHCO\n3\n - 0.21g/L\n\n        pH=7.7\n\nCaCO\n3\n; pH=7.9\n\nNaOH; pH 10\n\nM\nn\n\n2\n+\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n.L\n\n-1\n)\n\nTime (min)\n\n \n \n\nFigure 3.3 - Effect of different precipitants on manganese removal with limestone. \n\nExperimental conditions: 140.0 mg.L\n-1\n\n Mn synthetic solutions, initial pH 6.5, 12.5 g.L\n-1\n\n \n\nlimestone (<0.045 mm), 0.21 g.L\n-1\n\n or 0.67 g.L\n-1\n\n sodium bicarbonate, 23\u00b12\n?\nC. \n\n \n\nFrom the data presented in Figures 3.3 and 3.4, it is clear that the presence of soluble \n\ncarbonate species is not the only factor accounting for metal removal, but instead, the pH has \n\na leading role on the removal efficiency [20]. Even at higher carbonate concentrations, lower \n\nremoval efficiencies were observed with sodium bicarbonate as compared to sodium \n\ncarbonate (final pH 9.8) or even sodium hydroxide at pH 10.0. Figure 3.1 explains this \n\nbehavior as it shows smaller equilibrium metal concentrations when the pH increases in the \n\npresence of carbonate ions. Figure 3.4 also shows a fast reduction on aqueous manganese \n\nconcentration during the first five minutes, followed by a slower decrease in metal \n\nconcentration with time and suggests that 90 minutes are sufficient for the manganese \n\nconcentration to be stabilized.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 60  \n\n \n\n \n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n150\n\nNa\n2\nCO\n\n3\n - 0.26g/L  pH=8.2\n\nNa\n2\nCO\n\n3\n - 0.67g/l; pH=9.6\n\nMine water + CaCO\n3\n + Na\n\n2\nCO\n\n3\n;\n\n                pH=8.6\n\nCaCO\n3\n+ Na\n\n2\nCO\n\n3\n; pH=9.8\n\nM\nn\n\n2\n+\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\nTime (min)\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 - Effect of sodium carbonate concentration on manganese removal.

The manganese concentration was \n\nreduced to 1 mg.L\n-1\n\n within 60 minutes in the experiments with the latter, while 90 minutes \n\nwas required for the metal concentration to reach 0.18 mg.L\n-1\n\n, at pH 8.6, when the mine water \n\nwas tested. \n\n \n\nIn addition to mine drainages, manganese can be also present in effluents of \n\nhydrometallurgical operations as well as other industries and concentrations above 1 mg.L\n-1\n\n \n\nmay be found [15]. The element can be also present in leaching liquors for instance during sea \n\nnodules and nickel laterite leaching. In these solutions, manganese concentrations are high \n\nand carbonate was shown to precipitate manganese selectively with respect to calcium and \n\nmagnesium [21]. The carbonate efficiency in increasing pH, as well as the manganese \n\nremoval, was assessed from synthetic solutions, in which the manganese concentration varied \n\n\n\n 61  \n\n \n\n \n\nfrom 300.0 mg.L\n-1\n\n to 2000.0 mg.L\n-1\n\n, prepared at an initial pH value of 2.3.

In the experiment carried out only with sodium carbonate, the final concentration \n\nwas similar (0.81 mg.L\n-1\n\n); however, with a slower precipitation rate likely due to the absence \n\nof limestone in the reactor which would act as a surface for heterogeneous nucleation. This \n\nfinding is supported by Aziz et al. [23], who stated that the presence of solid limestone \n\nimproves metal removal efficiencies. When the initial pH is 2.3, manganese removal was also \n\nhigh because a higher sodium carbonate concentration was applied (0.83 g.L\n-1\n\n) that increased \n\nthe solution pH to the 7.1 - 9.2 range. \n\n \n\n0 120 240 360 480 600\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\nSynthetic solution\n\npH\ni\n = 2.3\n\nEfluent \n\nCaCO\n3\n + Na\n\n2\nCO\n\n3\n\nSynthetic solution\n\nCaCO\n3\n+ Na\n\n2\nCO\n\n3\n\nSynthetic solution\n\nNa\n2\nCO\n\n3\n\nM\nn\n\n2\n+\n c\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nm\n\ng\n/L\n\n)\n\nTime (min)\n\n\n\n 63  \n\n \n\n \n\nIt was also noticed that sulfate removal (Table 3.1) did not impair manganese precipitation. \n\nThis phenomenon was observed in a previous work when powdered limestone was applied for \n\nmanganese removal from a 16 mg.L\n-1\n\n Mn\n2+\n\n and 2400 mg.L\n-1\n\n sulfate solution [5].  \n\n \n\n \n\nThese authors observed a reduction in manganese removal from mine waters as compared to \n\nsynthetic solutions and this was ascribed to sulfate precipitation on the limestone surface. As \n\nshown in Table 3.1, the sulfate concentration (determined as total sulfur by ICP-OES) was \n\nreduced from 918 mg.L\n-1\n\n to 265 mg.L\n-1\n\n (equivalent to an uptake of 52.2 mg.g\n-1\n\n), which is \n\nslightly above the 250 mg.L\n-1\n\n discharge limit set by many countries worldwide. Other \n\ntransition metal elements, although in low concentrations were also removed during \n\ntreatment. These metals were shown to precipitate as either carbonates (FeCO3 and ZnCO3) or \n\nmixed hydroxide-carbonate compounds [24], which seems to be the case for copper and lead \n\nin the present work. Nevertheless, sulfate may have affected manganese removal kinetics, \n\nsince its removal from mine water was slower than from synthetic solutions and this was also \n\nobserved in batch experiments. Notwithstanding, sulfate sorption by limestone is currently \n\nbeing investigated. \n\n \n\nAs high carbonate concentration and pH values were utilized in the present work, manganese \n\nremoval as carbonate was expected; thereby infrared spectroscopy was applied to confirm \n\nmanganese carbonate formation. This was achieved by analyzing the solid material produced \n\nduring manganese removal by limestone-sodium carbonate blends. Figure 3.7 shows the \n\nspectra of limestone before and after contact with the manganese-laden solutions.  \n\n\n\n 64  \n\n \n\n \n\n680 700 720 740 760\n\n726 cm\n-1\n\n725 cm\n-1\n\n725 cm\n-1\n\n713 cm\n-1\n\n713 cm\n-1\n\n713 cm\n-1\n\n724 cm\n-1\n\n712 cm\n-1\n\nMnCO\n3\n ppt II\n\nMine water\n\nMnCO\n3\n ppt I\n\nMnCO\n3\n(p.a)\n\nLimestone\n\nWavenumber(cm\n-1\n)\n\n \n \n\nFigure 3.7 - Infrared spectra of pure manganese carbonate, limestone and manganese \n\ncarbonate precipitated on limestone surface.

For \n\npure calcite limestone, a characteristic band assigned to the C=O shift is seen at 712 cm\n-1\n\n. \n\nThis absorption band is seen at 724 cm\n-1\n\n for pure manganese carbonate, as proposed by the \n\nNassrallah-Aboukais et al. [25], who found this characteristic band at 726 cm\n-1\n\n for \n\nrhodocrosite. Also, Makreski and Jovanovski [26] observed C=O shifts at 712 cm\n-1 \n\nand \n\n722 cm\n-1\n\n, assigned to CaCO3 and MnCO3 in kutnahorite (CaMnMg(CO3)2). Similarly, this \n\nC=O band was observed at 728 cm\n-1\n\n for manganese carbonate by Santill\u00e1n et al. [27]. In \n\naddition to the C=O band at 712 cm\n-1\n\n (limestone), Figure 3.7 also shows a smaller IR shift at \n\n724 cm\n-1\n\n in the manganese-containing limestone produced in the experiments with the mine \n\nwater and those carried out with synthetic solutions containing 300 mg.L\n-1\n\n (ppt. I) and \n\n\n\n 65  \n\n \n\n \n\n1500 mg.L\n-1\n\n (ppt. II) manganese (Figure 3.5). The formation of manganese carbonate was \n\nconfirmed by IR spectroscopy and the C=O band at 724 cm\n-1\n\n is easily seen when the mass of \n\nprecipitated manganese carbonate is larger (ppt. II). These results are supported by XPS \n\nstudies on manganese - calcite interactions [28].   \n\n \n\nBamforth et al. [14] studied metal carbonate precipitation in the presence of limestone aiming \n\nto treat a mine water containing up to 5 mg.L\n-1\n\n manganese in the presence of calcium \n\n(~200 g.L\n-1\n\n) and magnesium (80-100 mg.L\n-1\n\n). Manganese carbonate was not observed on the \n\nsurface of limestone even though the mine water presented 2 meq.L\n-1\n\n total alkalinity. \n\nContrarily, magnesium calcite was the only described precipitate in the surface of either \n\ndolomite, magnesite or limestone and it was suggested that the presence of magnesium \n\ninhibited manganese carbonate formation. For the mine water studied in the present work, \n\nTable 3.1 suggests that the calcium removal was negligible, likely derived from limestone \n\ndissolution during the experiments as previously discussed (Figure 3.2). Conversely, \n\nmagnesium was also removed from the mine water as its concentration was reduced from 90.0 \n\nto 21.3 mg.L\n-1\n\n. Nevertheless, MgCO3 which has the C=O characteristic band at 749 cm\n-1\n\n [29]\n \n\ncould not be detected in Figure 3.7, possibly due to the low MgCO3 amount co-precipitated \n\nwith manganese. The findings of Bamforth et al. [14] seem to be related to the high Mg/Mn \n\nratio (> 20) in the mine water studied, which does not seem to be the case in the present work, \n\nwhere the initial Mg/Mn ratio was 0.64. \n\n \n\nThe precipitates were also analyzed by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy \n\ndispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Figure 3.8 depicts limestone particles containing \n\nmanganese produced in different conditions. Figures 3.8a and 3.8b show both images and \n\nEDS spectra of the solid material produced in the experiment with the mine water, while \n\n\n\n 66  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigures 3.8c and 3.8d show limestone particles containing manganese precipitated in the \n\nexperiments with 300 mg.L\n-1\n\n  and 2.000 mg.L\n-1\n\n manganese, respectively.  All EDS spectra \n\nshow calcium which is an indication that the larger particles are limestone, whereas \n\nFigures 3.8b and 3.8c show manganese mapping. While the EDS spectra identify manganese \n\non the surface of all the analyzed limestone particles, Figures 3.8b and 3.8c suggest that \n\nmanganese carbonate precipitates as very fine crystals, which is further supported by (i) an \n\nincrease in both surface and micropore areas from 1.54 m\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n and 2.20 m\n\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n to 4.45 m\n\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n \n\nand 5.30 m\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n, respectively; as well as (ii) a reduction on d50 of the particle size distribution \n\nfrom 5.6 \u00b5m to 3.6 \u00b5m, indicating a higher proportion of fine particles. \n\n \n\nThe produced manganese carbonate, although contaminated with magnesium can be blended \n\nwith manganese carbonate and smelted in the production of manganese ferroalloys. \n\nMagnesium carbonate is always present in these ores and is applied in the slag production \n\nstep [30]. It can also be applied in the production of manganese dioxide, since manganese \n\ncarbonate is easily soluble in sulfuric acid solutions [31] without requiring any reducing \n\nagent. It is very likely that mine waters or process effluents with high manganese \n\nconcentrations will be generated in a manganese mine or a manganese producing plant. \n\nTherefore, this blending could likely be carried out in a cost-effective way. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 67  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8 - SEM images and EDS spectra of manganese precipitated over limestone surfaces: mine water (a and \n\nb); manganese precipitated from synthetic solutions: 300 mg.L\n-1\n\n (c) and 2,0 g.L\n-1\n\n (d).

Manganese carbonate solubility increases quickly with \n\nacidity and even for high carbonate/metal ratios, but at lower pH values, precipitation may not \n\nbe complete. Bamforth et al. [14] observed low manganese removal (30%) with a mine water \n\ncontaining an average of 3 mg.L\n-1\n\n manganese, irrespective of the solid substrate utilized, at \n\npH 8.1. Conversely, Silva et al. [5] observed complete manganese removal from a 16.0 mg.L\n-1\n\n \n\nmine water at pH 8.8 with fine powdered limestone. The reason for the low removal observed \n\nin the former work is likely the lower pH of the mine water, which cannot support extensive \n\nmanganese carbonate formation. For those mine waters containing high manganese and \n\nrelatively low calcium and magnesium concentrations, manganese carbonate can be actually \n\nobserved on limestone surfaces, provided the mine water pH is increased. When limestone is \n\npresent, the removal kinetics is improved and a denser solid residue is produced with likely \n\nbetter settling features than the manganese carbonate alone. Future pilot scale experiments \n\nwill aim at determining process parameters and economics of an industrial scale process.   \n\n \n\n3.4 \u2013 Conclusions \n\n \n\nLimestone-sodium carbonate blends are beneficial for manganese removal from mine waters. \n\nSodium carbonate can provide carbonate ions to precipitate high manganese contents in mine \n\nwater and industrial effluents, whereas powdered limestone induces the heterogeneous \n\nnucleation of manganese carbonate. Manganese removal efficiency is defined by pH with \n\nvalues above 8.5 resulting in massive metal removal from the solution. Manganese carbonate \n\nprecipitation was confirmed by both infrared and EDS spectroscopy. Powdered limestone \n\n\n\n 69  \n\n \n\n \n\nenhances manganese precipitation kinetics and produces denser solid residue with potential \n\nadvantages regarding settling properties. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\n \n\nThe financial support from the funding agencies FINEP, FAPEMIG, CNPq and CAPES is \n\ngratefully appreciated.

Accordingly, limestone can be an option for sulfate removal, \n\nparticularly from neutral mine drainages. This work investigated sulfate removal from neutral \n\nmine waters through sorption on limestone in stirred-tank and fixed-bed experiments. The \n\ncontinuous stirred-tank experiments reduced the sulfate concentration from 588 to 87 mg.L\n-1\n\n \n\nat a 210 min residence time. The batch equilibrium tests showed that sulfate loading on \n\nlimestone can be described by the Langmuir isotherm, and a maximum loading of 23.7 mg.g\n- 1 \n\nlimestone was achieved. Fixed-bed experiments were utilized to produce breakthrough curves \n\nat different bed depths and flow rates. The BDST model was then applied, and it indicated \n\nsulfate loadings of up to 20.0 g SO4\n-2\n\n.L\n-1 \n\nbed as the flow rate increased from 1 to 10 mL.min\n-1\n\n. \n\nThomas, Yoon-Nelson and Dose response models showed good correlations with the \n\nexperimental data, predicting a particle loading of 20 mg.g\n-1 \n\nlimestone. Infrared spectrometry \n\nindicated the presence of sulfate ions and manganese carbonate on the limestone surface, with \n\nthe latter being the main toxic metal in the mine water. Sulfate sorption on limestone seems to \n\nbe an alternative to treating mine waters with moderate sulfate concentrations (below the \n\n1500-2000 mg.L\n-1\n\n range), where lime precipitation is not effective. In addition, this approach \n\ndoes not require alkaline pH values, as in the ettringite process.   \n\n \n\nKey-words: Sulfate, mine water, limestone, bed length, sorption models. \n\n\n\n 74  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.1 - Introduction  \n\n \n\nSulfate is a major anion occurring in both natural waters and industrial effluents, such as those \n\nof the chemical and metallurgical industries [1, 2], as well as acid mine drainage (AMD) [3]. \n\nAMD is generated by the oxidation of sulfide minerals in the presence of water and oxygen, \n\nproducing acidic effluents with large sulfate, iron, aluminum and manganese concentrations \n\nas well as hazardous trace elements, such as arsenic and uranium, depending on the \n\nmineralogy of the ore [4].  \n\n \n\nCompared with toxic metals, sulfate is only mildly hazardous. Therefore, many countries have \n\nno set guidelines for sulfate in drinking water. However, sulfate can affect the taste of water \n\nand can have laxative effects at concentrations above 600 mg.L\n-1\n\n. The World Health \n\nOrganization recommends that health authorities be notified if sulfate concentrations rise \n\nabove 500 mg.L\n-1\n\n  in drinking water [5]. Likewise, environmental agencies in mining \n\ncountries have set values varying between 250 and 500 mg.L\n-1\n\n in mine drainages or effluents. \n\nWhen there is no limit for sulfate, it is common to define limits for total dissolved solids, \n\nimplying that sulfate concentrations must comply with that value [6]. Considering the high \n\nconcentrations typically found in AMD, regulating sulfate is a considerable task.  \n\n \n\nEstablished methods for sulfate removal from mine waters include the following: (i) chemical \n\nprecipitation as gypsum, barium sulfate or ettringite; (ii) biological treatment with sulfate \n\nreducing bacteria; and (iii) sorption technologies, including membrane and ion exchange [3]. \n\nThe selection of the wastewater treatment technique usually depends on the type of \n\nwastewater, the removal kinetics, the sulfate concentration [7], the contaminant concentration \n\ndefined by environmental regulations [8] and costs. When there is a market for the drinking \n\n\n\n 75  \n\n \n\n \n\nwater produced from AMD, more expensive technologies may be applied, such as in the \n\nEmalahleni Water Reclamation Plant in South Africa [9].  \n\n \n\nAdsorption methods are usually applied in environmental engineering because of their good \n\nselectivity [3] and their production of high-quality water [10]. Well-designed sorption \n\nprocesses have high efficiencies, and the treated water can either be recycled or disposed of \n\n[11]. A fixed-bed column is an effective option for sorption process applications, and the \n\nsuccessful design of a sorption system requires the prediction of the concentration-time \n\nbreakthrough curve [12].  \n\n \n\nThe use of limestone and other alkaline reagents has proven to be effective in increasing pH \n\nand thereby removing metals present in mine waters [13] through precipitation and/or \n\nadsorption [4]. Limestone itself is widely applied as a neutralizer for acid mine drainages \n\n[14], but its efficiency as a neutralizer is reduced if the mine water is only mildly acidic. The \n\narmoring effect, which is the precipitation of iron and aluminum oxyhydroxides or calcium \n\nsulfate on the limestone surface, also contributes to this lower reactivity. Nevertheless, \n\nbecause sulfate can be effectively sorbed on limestone (armoring), sorption can be an option \n\nfor lowering the anion concentration, particularly in neutral mine waters. Calcium based \n\nneutralizing agents precipitate gypsum and thereby decrease sulfate concentrations in mine \n\nwaters [13]. However, because of solubility constraints, residual sulfate concentrations remain \n\nhigh, within the 1500-2000 mg.L\n-1\n\n range. In the present work, a different approach is \n\nproposed where limestone is applied for sulfate sorption, particularly in those mine waters \n\nwith moderate anion concentrations (below 1500 mg.L\n-1\n\n) that remain above the discharge \n\nlimit set by environmental agencies. Accordingly, this work was performed to assess the \n\nprincipal parameters related to such an approach. \n\n\n\n 76  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2 - Materials and methods  \n\n \n\n4.2.1 - Calcite limestone and mine waters \n\n \n\nA calcite limestone sample assaying 53.7% calcium and 0.28% magnesium was kindly \n\nprovided by Brazilian producers. The sample was dry-sieved using Tyler sieves. Two particle \n\nsize ranges were selected for the experiments. One, with a particle size between 0.42 mm and \n\n0.59 mm (0.774 m\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n specific surface area), was used in fixed-bed experiments. The other, \n\nwith a particle size&lt;0.045 mm (2.048 m\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n specific surface area) was selected for batch \n\ntesting in a stirred reactor.  \n\n \n\n4.2.2 - Batch experiments \n\n \n\nSulfate removal experiments were performed by mixing 1.5 L of mine water at pH 6.5 (initial \n\nvalue) containing  588.0 mg.L\n-1\n\n SO4\n2-\n\n with 25 g.L\n-1\n\n limestone in an orbital shaker at 300 min\n-1\n\n \n\nand 23?1\no\nC. Both particle size fractions were utilized in these experiments. Samples were \n\nwithdrawn after 5 minutes in the first half hour and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 hours. At the end \n\nof the experiment, both the pulp pH and Eh were measured, the slurry was filtered and the \n\nsulfate concentration in the aqueous phase was determined. Unless otherwise stated, sulfate \n\n(and metal) concentrations in the aqueous phase were determined by ICP-OES (Varian 725), \n\nwhereas the anion content on the solid phase was calculated by mass balance. \n\n \n\nA pseudo-adsorption isotherm was produced from batch data using synthetic sulfate solutions \n\nso that the maximum limestone loading could be assessed. The procedure consisted of \n\nshaking (at 300 min\n-1\n\n) limestone particles (0.42-0.59 mm) added to 250 mL erlenmeyer flasks \n\n\n\n 77  \n\n \n\n \n\ncontaining 120 mL of sulfate solutions. The anion concentration varied from 50.0 to \n\n3000.0 g.L\n-1\n\n (pH 9.6-9.8). The pulp contained 25.0 g.L\n-1\n\n solids, and the experiments were run \n\nfor 9 hours. Afterward, the sorption process was modeled according to the Freundlich and \n\nLangmuir equations.  \n\n \n\n4.2.3 - Continuous experiments \n\n \n\nContinuous experiments were carried out in a stirred reactor with a 1.67 L capacity at 23?1\no\nC. \n\nThe reactor was fed separately with (i) 588.0 mg.L\n-1\n\n SO4\n2-\n\n mine water with a pH of 6.5 and \n\n(ii) a pulp made of limestone (25.0 g.L\n-1\n\n) with a particle size&lt;0.045 mm and distilled water. \n\nThe stirring rate was set at 1200 min\n-1\n\n, and pumping was provided by two peristaltic pumps \n\n(Milan 628), one feeding the mine water at 4.0 mL.min\n-1 \n\nand the other feeding the limestone \n\npulp (at the same flow rate) to the reactor. The residence time was set at 210 minutes, and the \n\nexperiments ran for at least 9 residence time periods to ensure steady-state conditions. After \n\nevery 210 minutes, an aliquot was withdrawn from the reactor and filtered, and both the pH \n\nand sulfate content were measured. Prior to and during the experiments, the mine water was \n\nstored in plastic containers at room temperature. \n\n \n\n4.2.4 - Fixed-bed experiments \n\n \n\nIn the fixed-bed experiments, limestone particles (91.92 g, 86.94 g, 81.10 g and 52.85 g) with \n\nan average diameter of 505 \u00b5m were transferred to a glass column (20 mm diameter) to \n\nproduce different bed lengths (Z): 250, 200, 150 and 100 mm. After loading, distilled water \n\nwas passed through the column (60 min) to remove any fine particles that may have been \n\nloaded in the column. The column was fed upward by peristaltic pumps so that any \n\n\n\n 78  \n\n \n\n \n\npreferential pathway for the solution would be avoided, and the flow rate (Q) was varied \n\nbetween 1 and 10 mL.min\n-1\n\n. Samples were collected regularly from the column effluent. The \n\nsulfate concentration in these samples was analyzed by ICP-OES (Varian, 725). Sulfate \n\nloading on limestone was determined by mass balance.   \n\n \n\n4.2.5 - Infrared analysis and scanning electron microscopy \n\n \n\nFourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) measurements were carried out by transmission (KBr \n\npellet) method using a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer from the ThermoElectron \n\nCorporation that was equipped with a DLaTGS (deuterated lanthanum triglycine sulfate) \n\ndetector and sealed CsI optics. The samples were mixed with KBr and mounted under the \n\nspectrometer apparatus. FT-IR spectra were recorded in the transmittance mode in the 400-\n\n4000 cm\n-1 \n\nregion, with a minimum of 32 scans at a 4 cm\n-1 \n\nresolution. Automatic atmospheric \n\nsuppression was applied during collection of the spectra. \n\n \n\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the morphology of limestone \n\nparticles before and after sulfate sorption. The samples were observed in a low vacuum \n\nscanning electron microscope, Inspect S50 (FEI) equipped with the software Esprit 1.9 \u2013 \n\nQUANTAX 200. The samples were mounted in an epoxy resin, before observation at 15kV \n\nvoltage. An energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy system (EDS) was utilized for elemental \n\nmapping.      \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 79  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3 - Kinetics modeling \n\n \n\nSulfate sorption on limestone in the fixed-bed experiments was modeled by applying the \n\nfollowing models: (i) Bohart-Adams, (ii) Thomas, (iii) Yoon and Nelson and (iv) Dose-\n\nresponse. These models have been reviewed [12,15,16], and their corresponding equations are \n\nlisted in Table 4.1.  \n\n \n\nTable 4.1 - Models equations applied for prediction of breakthrough curve.  \n\nModel Equation Reference \n\nBohart-Adams \n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n\ntkC\nU\n\nZkNC\n\nC\n\n0\n00 exp1\n\n1\n \n\n[30] \n\nThomas \n??\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n\nQ\n\nVkC\n\nQ\n\nmkqC\n\nC\n\n000 exp1\n\n1\n \n\n[12] \n\nYoon and \n\nNelson \n\n? ?\n? ?\n\n5.0\n\n5.0\n\n0\nexp1\n\nexp\n\ntktk\n\ntktk\n\nC\n\nC\n\nynyn\n\nynyn\n\n??\n\n?\n?

This equation is applied in the development of the BDST model [17]. The \n\nThomas model assumes that the sorption isotherm can be described by the Langmuir equation \n\nand the plug flow behavior in the bed. The model also assumes that the sorption kinetics are \n\n\n\n 80  \n\n \n\n \n\ndescribed by the second-order reversible reaction. Therefore, this model is suitable for \n\nsorption processes that are not controlled by film or surface diffusion. The main assumption \n\nof the Yoon and Nelson equation is that the rate of decrease in the sorption probability of each \n\nmolecule is proportional to the probability of sorbate sorption and that of sorbate \n\nbreakthrough [18]. The modified Dose-response model is an empirical equation proposed by \n\nYan et al. [12] to model fixed-bed biosorption, which was later applied to zinc [19] and \n\nchromium sorption [18].  \n\n \n\n4.4 - Results and discussion \n\n \n\nIn this work, two approaches were applied to study sulfate sorption on limestone: (i) stirred-\n\ntank experiments utilizing fine powdered (<0.045 mm) limestone and (ii) sulfate removal in \n\nfixed-bed columns with a coarser limestone particle size (0.42-0.59 mm). The experiments \n\nwere performed with neutral mine water (pH 6.5) samples, assaying 588.0 - 1100 mg.L\n-1\n\n \n\nsulfate (Table 4.2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 81  \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4.2 - Sulfate removal in batch experiments.

Therefore, only experiments performed \n\nwith mine waters are reported here.  \n\n \n\nInitially, batch experiments using sulfate-containing mine waters were carried out to define \n\nthe mass of powdered limestone (particle size&lt;0.045 mm) required for the anion removal, \n\nand 25.0 g.L\n-1\n\n was selected for further experiments. This value enabled the sulfate \n\nconcentration to be reduced from 588 mg.L\n-1\n\n to 162.6 mg.L\n-1\n\n within 210 minutes (Figure 4.1), \n\nwhile the pH increased from 6.5 to 8.2. This time span was set as the residence time in the \n\nsubsequent continuous experiments because it produced sulfate concentrations below \n\n250 mg.L\n-1\n\n (the maximum discharge value allowable by the environmental regulations of \n\nmany mining countries).  \n\n \n\nThe sulfate concentration leveled out at 91 mg.L\n-1\n\n within 360 min at the same pH value, \n\nwhich represents a loading of 20 mg SO4\n2-\n\n.g\n-1 \n\nlimestone.

Figure 4.2 shows the influence of time on sulfate removal from the 588 mg.L\n-1\n\n \n\nmine water. It can be observed that, with time, the pH increased to 8.3 (at a steady state), in \n\nagreement with the batch studies.  \n\n \n\nFor an 210 min residence time, the sulfate concentration reached 87 mg.L\n-1\n\n after 10 \n\nresidences time periods, which corresponds to a limestone loading of 8.3 mg SO4\n2-\n\n.g\n-1 \n\nlimestone. By studying the sulfate sorption using Lewatit K6362 (a type I quaternary amine \n\nion exchange resin), a maximum loading of 10 g.L\n-1 \n\nresin was observed [7], whereas an \n\nuptake of 4.5 mg.g\n-1\n\n (at pH 4.0) was observed during sulfate loading on coconut coir pitch \n\n[20].

[22] investigated sulfate sorption on soil samples and observed \n\nthat the Langmuir model produced a maximum loading value of 90.2 mg.kg\n-1\n\n. Likewise, rice \n\nstraw, a lignocellulosic agricultural residue, was chemically converted into a strong basic \n\nanion exchanger and applied for sulfate removal, showing 74.4 mg.g\n-1\n\n as the maximum \n\nadsorption capacity (Langmuir isotherm), in contrast to that of raw straw (11.7 mg.g\n-1\n\n) \n\n[3].Fixed-bed testing was applied to sulfate removal from three different mine water sample \n\nassays: 588.0 mg.L\n-1\n\n, 800.1 mg.L\n-1\n\n and 1100.1 mg SO4\n2-\n\n.L\n-1\n\n. The effects of bed height (Z), \n\nflow rate (Q) and initial sulfate concentration (C0) on sulfate sorption on limestone were \n\nassessed. Table 4.3 depicts the most important experimental parameters of the breakthrough \n\ncurves presented in Figure 4.4.

Nevertheless, the \n\nbreakthrough and saturation volumes increased with flow rate, along with the number of bed \n\nvolumes treated at breakthrough, Nb (Table 4.3), at the same bed depth.  \n\n \n\nThe breakthrough and saturation times were also reduced when the initial sulfate \n\nconcentration was increased from 588 to 1100 mg.L\n-1\n\n (at a 25 cm bed depth). For instance, at \n\n800.1 and 1100.1 mg.L\n-1\n\n, the breakthrough time was reduced to 98.0 and 77.3 min, \n\nrespectively. This result can be ascribed to the faster exhaustion of sorption sites, i.e., because \n\nthe total number of sites available for sorption was limited, an increase in the initial \n\nconcentration resulted in a decrease in sulfate sorption [16]. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Empty Bed Contact Time (EBCT), equation 4.1 and the adsorbent usage rate (AUR), \n\ndefined as the weight of sorbent saturated per volume of treated solution (equation 4.2), are \n\nalso given in Table 4.3. \n\n  \n\nQ\n\nZA\nEBCT c?

It can be observed that the sulfate \n\nloading on limestone beds increases with flow rate until reaching 20.5 g.L\n-1 \n\nbed (at \n\n10 cm.min\n-1\n\n), which is close to the maximum loading (23.7 mg.g\n-1\n\n) indicated by the Langmuir \n\nequation (Figure 4.3).  \n\n \n\nThe sorption rate constant can be determined from the 10% breakthrough plot, and equation \n\n4.3 predicts that the intercept should be a negative value. As shown in Table 4.4, the \n\nintercepts at both 1 and 2 mL.min\n-1\n\n are positive, which is a violation of the BDST theory. \n\nTherefore, the rate constant was not determined for such flow rate values. Nevertheless, the \n\nflow rate value of 3 mL.min\n-1\n\n seems to provide faster limestone sorption on limestone (k = \n\n1.056x10\n-3 \n\nL.(g.min)\n-1\n\n) compared with the experiments carried out with a 10 mL.min\n-1\n\n flow \n\nrate (k = 1.12x10\n-4 \n\nL.(g.min)\n-1\n\n). Furthermore, as predicted by equation 4, the plot of t0.5 versus \n\nZ should be a straight line passing through the origin. However, Figure 4.6 shows that the \n\nlinear plot does not demonstrate such behavior, which indicates that the sulfate sorption on \n\nlimestone is a complex phenomenon that likely involves more than one rate limiting step, as \n\nwill be discussed further in this work [16]. Comparing the intercepts at 10% breakthrough, it \n\ncan be observed that this parameter is reduced (from +44.8 to 33.4) for increasing flow rates. \n\nThis result suggests that the mass transfer resistance in the solid phase is not predominant; \n\notherwise, the observed intercept values would not be significantly affected by changes in the \n\nflow rate, as discussed by Cooney [24]. This scenario may likely be a result of the low surface \n\narea of the limestone particles, which do not present significant porosity. The BDST theory \n\nalso predicts (equation 4.4) that the service time at different flow rates should increase \n\nlinearly with the inverse of the axial velocity (U). However, this correlation is not followed in \n\n\n\n 92  \n\n \n\n \n\nthe present work because the slope at 50% breakthrough actually increased with the flow rate \n\n(from 2 to 10 mL.min\n-1\n\n), as shown in Table 4.4.  \n\n \n\nTable 4.4 - Bed capacity, rate Constant and slope values for sulfate loading on limestone at \n\ndifferent flow rates, according to the BDST model. \n\n \n\nFlow rate \n\n(mL.min\n-1\n\n) \n\nBed capacity (g.L\n-1\n\nbed) Rate constant  \n\n(10\n-4\n\nL.(mg.min)\n-1 \n\n10% breakthrough 50% breakthrough \n\n1 1.187 1.462 - \n\n2 2.083 2.583 - \n\n3 3.222 4.048 10.56 \n\n10 12.079 19.685 1.12 \n\nFlow rate \n\n(mL.min\n-1\n\n) \n\nSlope \n\n10% breakthrough 50% breakthrough \n\n1 6.31 7.77 \n\n2 5.54 6.84 \n\n3 5.77 7.24 \n\n10 6.42 10.46 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn addition to the BDST model, 3 different equations were applied to model the breakthrough \n\ncurves produced during sulfate sorption on calcite limestone: (i) Thomas, (ii) Yoon and \n\nNelson and (iii) Dose-response [16,18]. Figures 4.7-4.9 present the experimental data points \n\nand theoretical breakthrough curves for the experiments performed with the 588 mg.L\n-1\n\n mine \n\nwater.

Therefore, an increase in flow rate causes a decrease in the film resistance and a \n\npositive effect on mass transfer [10]. This relationship is highlighted in the analysis of the rate \n\nconstant, i.e., higher flow rates resulted in larger k values, which implies that the sorption \n\nprocess is mainly controlled by film diffusion. Film diffusion varies with flow rate, but \n\nsurface diffusion does not; surface diffusion is independent of fluid flow, as mentioned in \n\n[24,26]. \n\n \n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0 a\n\n10.0mL.min\n\n3.0mL.min\n\n2.0mL.min\n\n1.0mL.min\n\nC\nt/C\n\n0\n\nTime (min)\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\nb\n\n10.0mL.min\n\n3.0mL.min\n2.0mL.min\n\n1.0mL.min\n\nC\nt/C\n\n0\n\nTime (min)\n\n \n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0 c\n\n10.0mL.min\n\n3.0mL.min\n\n2.0mL.min\n\n1.0mL.min\n\nC\nt/C\n\n0\n\nTime (min)\n\n-100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0 d\n\n10.0mL.min\n\n3.0mL.min\n\n2.0mL.min\n\n1.0mL.min\n\nC\nt/C\n\n0\n\nTime (min)\n\n \n\nFigure 4.7 - Comparison of experimental and theoretical breakthrough curves for sulfate \n\nsorption on limestone using the Thomas model.

In addition, the straight line describing service time \n\nversus bed depth does not pass through the origin, which indicates that the sorption process is \n\ncomplex. Chemical reactions, which are not thought to control the sorption process kinetics, \n\nmay play an important role in the sulfate sorption on limestone.  \n\n \n\nThe sorption mechanism was analyzed by Infrared spectroscopy, and the Figure 4.10 shows \n\nan infrared spectrum for the limestone particles after sulfate uptake in stirred tank experiments \n\n(Figure 4.2). Also shown are the spectra of both pure limestone and di-hydrate calcium \n\nsulfate. The sulfate ions show fundamental vibrations due to symmetric (at 981 cm\n-1\n\n) and \n\nasymmetric (1104 cm\n-1\n\n)\n \nstretching vibrations. Symmetric and asymmetric bending vibrations \n\nare observed at 451 and 613 cm\n-1\n\n, respectively. In the range of 400-800 cm\n-1\n\n, CaSO4.2H2O \n\nshows a doublet at 668 cm\n-1\n\n and 603 cm\n-1\n\n due to ?4(SO4\n2\n) bending vibrations [27]. Pure \n\nlimestone shows a strong C=O IR shift at 712 cm\n-1\n\n [28]. The spectrum of the sulfate-loaded \n\nlimestone shows a peak at 668 cm\n-1\n\n, which suggests the presence of sulfate ions on the \n\nlimestone surface, but the absence of the 603 cm\n-1\n\n band indicates that a different calcium \n\nsulfate compound has actually formed. Nevertheless, this observation requires further \n\ninvestigation. Another important outcome observed in Figure 4.10 is the peak at 725 cm\n-1\n\n, \n\nwhich can be ascribed to the presence of manganese carbonate on the limestone surface. As \n\nshown in Table 4.1, this mine water contains 30-45 mg.L\n-1\n\n manganese, which has been shown \n\nto sorb on limestone as manganese carbonate [8].   \n\n\n\n 99  \n\n \n\n \n\n400 500 600 700 800\n\n603 cm\n-1\n\n668 cm\n-1\n\nSulfate \n\non limestone\n\nMnCO\n3\n\nCaSO\n4\n.2H\n\n2\nO\n\nResidue\n\nLimestone\n\nWavenumber (cm\n-1\n)\n\n \n\nFigure 4.10 - Infrared spectra for limestone, calcium sulfate di-hydrate and sulfate-laden \n\nlimestone.  \n\n \n\nSEM-EDS were applied to further characterize the limestone particles before and after sulfate \n\nremoval.

Figure 4.11b and 4.11c shows, respectively, oxygen and \n\ncalcium mapping confirming the nature of limestone particles. A composed image (Figure \n\n4.11e) showing limestone particles and sulfur mapping (red) suggests sorption as the only \n\nremoval mechanism. Bulk calcium sulfate precipitation, which might have occurred from \n\nlimestone dissolution (which is observed when acid water is treated with the latter) did not \n\nseem to be important herein because the studied mine water is neutral (pH 6.5). This is \n\nsupported by the results on Table 4.2 that show low calcium dissolution during sulfate \n\nremoval.     \n\n \n\n\n\n 100  \n\n \n\n \n\nAn analysis of some of the chemical species present in the three studied mine water samples \n\n(Table 4.2) suggests that these species were removed during treatment with limestone. \n\nManganese is a major toxic element in this mine water, and it cannot be completely removed \n\nby limestone, although soluble carbonate sources would improve its precipitation. \n\nNevertheless, the manganese concentration was reduced in the best case to 1.5 mg.L\n-1\n\n, which \n\nimplies that the mine water would require further treatment for its removal before discharge. \n\nMinor toxic metals, such as copper and zinc, were also removed.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 101  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\na b \n\nc d \n\ne \n\nFigure 4.11- Limestone particles before and \n\nafter sulfate sorption in fixe-bed experiments. \n\n(a) limestone particles before sulfate sorption; \n\n(b) oxygen and (c) calcium mapping;(d) \n\nComposed image showing limestone particles \n\nand sulfur mapping (red); (e) manganese \n\nmapping \n\n\n\n 102  \n\n \n\n \n\nSorption (either precipitation or adsorption) on the limestone surface is the mechanism \n\naccounting for such removal [29]. The findings of the present work suggest that surface \n\nreaction is part of the sorption mechanism. The second order kinetics observed in the batch \n\nstudies; the good fitting to the Langmuir isotherm along with the infra-red results support \n\nsulfate chemisorption on limestone. From the hypothesis of each tested model for fixed bed \n\nsorption, the Thomas model appears to be the most suitable for describing the breakthrough \n\ncurves.     \n\n \n\nThe main species in the mine water, sulfate, was removed to leave concentrations that comply \n\nwith environmental regulations, as discussed in this work. In those mine waters with high \n\nsulfate concentrations, lime precipitation still seems to be the best choice because of its high \n\nefficiency in reducing sulfate concentrations to the 1500-2000 mg.L\n-1\n\n range. However, if the \n\nsulfate concentration in the mine water is below this range (as in the three mine water samples \n\ncurrently studied), and the lime precipitation is not effective, limestone sorption could be a \n\ncost-effective alternative compared with other sulfate removal techniques, such as ettringite \n\nprecipitation and membrane or ion exchange technologies. The removal efficiency of \n\nlimestone can be increased if a fine powder material is applied in stirred tanks, as has been \n\nshown. This technology would be particularly suitable for those countries where water is \n\nwidely available and where mine water treatment costs must remain as low as possible \n\nbecause there is no possibility to commercialize the treated water. \n\n \n\n 4.5 - Conclusions \n\n \n\nThis work showed that limestone can be a cost-effective alternative to treating mine waters \n\nwith sulfate concentrations (1500 and 2000 mg.L\n- 1\n\n) below the values defined by gypsum \n\n\n\n 103  \n\n \n\n \n\nsolubility and where only more expensive processes are available. Sulfate sorption on \n\nlimestone can be described by the Langmuir isotherm, which showed a maximum uptake of \n\n23.7 mg.g\n-1 \n\nlimestone. Fine powdered limestone (<0.045 mm) can be applied to treat \n\nmoderate sulfate concentrations (588 mg.L\n-1\n\n) in stirred reactors, whereby sulfate \n\nconcentrations can be lowered to below 100 mg.L\n-1\n\n. Alternatively, fixed-bed experiments can \n\nbe utilized to produce sulfate uptakes as high as 20 g.L\n-1 \n\nbed, while the sorption process can \n\nbe described by simple models, such as the Thomas, Yoon and Nelson and Dose-response \n\nequations. The BDST model can be applied for design purposes, whereas the process seems to \n\nbe mostly film diffusion controlled because the flow rate has important effects on the fixed \n\nbed sorption.    \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\n \n\nThe financial support from the funding agencies FINEP, FAPEMIG, CNPq and CAPES is \n\ngratefully appreciated.

Entretanto, a remo\u00e7\u00e3o pode ser conseguida pela adi\u00e7\u00e3o de fontes sol\u00faveis de carbonatos \n\ncomo o carbonato de s\u00f3dio. Nesse caso, o mecanismo que contribuiu para a remo\u00e7\u00e3o do metal \n\nem solu\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 a precipita\u00e7\u00e3o, no qual o precipitante utilizado \u00e9 o \u00edon carbonato sol\u00favel. Essa \n\nafirma\u00e7\u00e3o foi corroborada pelas an\u00e1lises dos res\u00edduos s\u00f3lidos caracterizados no FTIR e no \n\nMEV, que demonstraram a forma\u00e7\u00e3o do precipitado de carbonato de mangan\u00eas. \n\n \n\nO calc\u00e1rio pode ser aplicado para adsor\u00e7\u00e3o do mangan\u00eas nas \u00e1guas de mina para baixa \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o do elemento, e o equil\u00edbrio da adsor\u00e7\u00e3o pode ser descrito pelas equa\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\nFreundlich ou de Langmuir, sendo o carregamento m\u00e1ximo alcan\u00e7ado de 0,91 mg Mn.g\n-1\n\n \n\ncalc\u00e1rio. Os modelos de Thomas, de Yoon e Nelson e de Dose- response descreveram o \n\ncomportamento da adsor\u00e7\u00e3o em coluna. O potencial zeta sugeriu uma adsor\u00e7\u00e3o espec\u00edfica do \n\nmangan\u00eas na superf\u00edcie do calc\u00e1rio, o que foi confirmada pela espectrofotometria no \n\ninfravermelho (FTIR) que mostrou a presen\u00e7a de carbonato do mangan\u00eas na superf\u00edcie do \n\nmesmo, ou seja, ocorreu a adsor\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica do mangan\u00eas na superf\u00edcie do calc\u00e1rio. Em \n\ncoluna de leito fixo, o carregamento do metal foi baixo e aumentou com a vaz\u00e3o (1,0 para \n\n3,0 mL.min\n-1\n\n) para a \u00e1gua de mina com baixa concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de mangan\u00eas (1,5 mg.L\n-1\n\n), mas \n\ndiminuiu quando a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o do metal na solu\u00e7\u00e3o aumentou (1,5 para 15,0 mg.L\n-1\n\n). \n\nDurante experimento na coluna de leito fixo, o carregamento m\u00e1ximo (0,057 mgMn.mL\n-1\n\n \n\n\n\n 108  \n\n \n\n \n\nleito) foi observado para 15,0 mgMn.L\n-1\n\n com uma vaz\u00e3o de 1 mL.min\n-1\n\n. O modelo BDST \n\nconfirmou o baixo carregamento do mangan\u00eas, mas alternativamente, observou-se que o \n\nmangan\u00eas pode ser removido de \u00e1gua de mina em reatores agitados.   \n\n \n\nEste trabalho mostrou que o calc\u00e1rio pode ser adsorvente promissor e uma alternativa de \n\nbaixo custo para tratar \u00e1gua de mina da ind\u00fastria minero-metal\u00fargica com as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es do \n\nsulfato abaixo dos valores definidos pela solubilidade da gipsita (1500-2000 mg.L\n-1\n\n). A \n\nadsor\u00e7\u00e3o do sulfato no calc\u00e1rio pode ser descrito pela isoterma de Langmuir, que mostrou um \n\ncarregamento m\u00e1ximo de 23,7 mgMn.g\n-1\n\n calc\u00e1rio. O calc\u00e1rio fino (<0,045 mm) pode ser \n\naplicado para tratar as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es moderadas do sulfato (588,0 mg.L\n-1\n\n) em reatores \n\nagitados, e por meio deste, as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es do sulfato podem ser reduzidas para valores \n\nabaixo dos definidos pela legisla\u00e7\u00e3o pertinente. Alternativamente, a adsor\u00e7\u00e3o em coluna de \n\nleito fixo pode ser utilizada para produzir os carregamentos do sulfato de at\u00e9 20 mgSO4\n2-\n\n.L\n-1\n\n \n\nleito. O processo de adsor\u00e7\u00e3o pode ser descrito por modelos como o de Thomas, de Yoon e \n\nNelson e de Dose-response. \n\n \n\n \n\n.   \n\n\n\n 109  \n\n \n\n \n\nCap\u00edtulo 6 \n\n \n\n6.1 - Contribui\u00e7\u00f5es ao Conhecimento \n\n \n\nO trabalho modelou, pela primeira vez, o uso de calc\u00e1rio, como adsorvente, para a remo\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndo sulfato de \u00e1gua de mina de uma ind\u00fastria minero-metal\u00fargica com concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de 600,0 \n\na 1100 mg.L\n-1\n\n e determinou os par\u00e2metros de adsor\u00e7\u00e3o em colunas de leito fixo.
