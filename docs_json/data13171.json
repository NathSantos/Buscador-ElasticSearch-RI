Como tal, este trabalho aborda duas \nquest\u00f5es cient\u00edficas principais. Uma delas diz respeito \u00e0 compreens\u00e3o dos \nm\u00e9todos de (bio)remedia\u00e7\u00e3o aplicados aos efluentes produzidos em RAS \nmarinhos, identificando as suas vantagens, desvantagens e lacunas \nrelativas \u00e0 sua explora\u00e7\u00e3o nos efluentes de \u00e1gua salgada. A segunda \u00e9 o \ndesenvolvimento de um m\u00e9todo novo, inovador e eficiente para o tratamento \nde efluentes de \u00e1gua salgada que potencialmente preenchem as lacunas \nidentificadas nos tratamentos convencionais. Desse modo, os objetivos \ndesta tese s\u00e3o: (i) rever os tratamentos convencionais aplicados para os \nprincipais contaminantes nos efluentes RAS marinhos, com especial \nincid\u00eancia sobre as abordagens de biorremedia\u00e7\u00e3o j\u00e1 realizados para \nfosfatos; (ii) caracterizar e avaliar o potencial de res\u00edduos de concha de \nostra colhidos na Ria de Aveiro como um agente de biorremedia\u00e7\u00e3o de \nfosfatos em \u00e1gua salgada artificial, mediante diferentes fatores (e.g., pr\u00e9-\ntratamento das conchas de ostra por calcina\u00e7\u00e3o, tamanho de part\u00edcula, \nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de adsorvente). Apesar das conchas de ostras j\u00e1 terem sido \ntestadas na remo\u00e7\u00e3o de f\u00f3sforo (P) em \u00e1gua doce, o seu potencial de \nbiosor\u00e7\u00e3o de P em \u00e1gua salgada, tanto quanto eu estou ciente, ainda n\u00e3o \nfoi avaliado. Os resultados demonstraram que as conchas naturais (NOS) \ns\u00e3o compostas principalmente por carbonatos, sendo estes praticamente \nconvertidos em cal (CaO) ap\u00f3s calcina\u00e7\u00e3o. Tal pr\u00e9-tratamento permitiu a \nobten\u00e7\u00e3o de um material mais reativo (COS) para a remo\u00e7\u00e3o de P, uma vez \nque se observou maiores percentagens de remo\u00e7\u00e3o e capacidade de \nadsor\u00e7\u00e3o. Fra\u00e7\u00f5es de menor tamanho, tanto para NOS e COS, aumentaram \na remo\u00e7\u00e3o de P. Os modelos cin\u00e9ticos mostraram que NOS ajusta-se, \nsimultaneamente, aos modelos de Elovich e de Difus\u00e3o Intrapart\u00edcula, o que \nsugere que a remo\u00e7\u00e3o de P \u00e9 um processo controlado tanto quimicamente \ncomo pela taxa de difus\u00e3o. A percentagem de remo\u00e7\u00e3o de P em COS n\u00e3o \u00e9 \ncontrolada por difus\u00e3o e o modelo Elovich foi o que melhor se ajustou para a \nremo\u00e7\u00e3o de fosfato. Este trabalho demonstrou que os res\u00edduos de conchas \nde ostra, quer NOS ou COS, podem ser usados como biosorventes na \nremo\u00e7\u00e3o de fosfato em \u00e1gua salgada. Desse modo, este biomaterial pode \nsustentar uma estrat\u00e9gia de biorremedia\u00e7\u00e3o econ\u00f3mica e amiga do \nambiente, com potencial para aplica\u00e7\u00e3o em RAS de \u00e1gua salgada. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\"\n\"\n\n\n\n \n\n!\n!\n \n\n \n\n \n\nkeywords aquaculture wastewaters, bioadsorption, biomaterials,  bioprecipitation, \ncalcinations, oyster-shell waste, phosphate removal, remediation methods \n\n \n\nabstract Marine Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) produce great volume of \nwastewater, which may be reutilized/recirculated or reutilized after undergoing \ndifferent treatment/remediation methods, or partly discharged into neighbour \nwater-bodies (DWW). Phosphates, in particular, are usually accumulated at \nhigh concentrations in DWW, both because its monitoring is not compulsory \nfor fish production since it is not a limiting parameter, and also because there \nis no specific treatment so far developed to remove them, especially in what \nconcerns saltwater effluents.  As such, this work addresses two main scientific \nquestions. One of them regards the understanding of the actual \n(bio)remediation methods applied to effluents produced in marine RAS, by  \nidentifying their advantages, drawbacks and gaps concerning their exploitation \nin saltwater effluents. The second one is the development of a new, innovative \nand efficient method for the treatment of saltwater effluents that potentially \nfulfil the gaps identified in the conventional treatments. Thereby, the aims of \nthis thesis are: (i) to revise the conventional treatments targeting major \ncontaminants in marine RAS effluents, with a particular focus on the \nbioremediation approaches already conducted for phosphates; (ii) to \ncharacterize and evaluate the potential of oyster-shell waste collected in Ria \nde Aveiro as a bioremediation agent of phosphates spiked into artificial \nsaltwater, over different influencing factors (e.g., oyster-shell pre-treatment \nthrough calcination, particle size, adsorbent concentration). Despite the use of \noyster-shells for phosphorous (P) removal has already been applied in \nfreshwater, its biosorptive potential for P in saltwater was never evaluated, as \nfar as I am aware. The results herein generated showed that NOS is mainly \ncomposed by carbonates, which are almost completely converted into lime \n(CaO) after calcination (COS). Such pre-treatment allowed obtaining a more \nreactive material for P removal, since higher removal percentages and \nadsorption capacity was observed for COS. Smaller particle size fractions for \nboth NOS and COS samples also increased P removal. Kinetic models \nshowed that NOS adsorption followed, simultaneously, Elovich and \nIntraparticle Difusion kinetic models, suggesting that P removal is both a \ndiffusional and chemically rate-controlled process. The percentage of P \nremoval by COS was not controlled by Intraparticle Diffusion and the Elovich \nmodel was the kinetic model that best fitted phosphate removal. This work \ndemonstrated that waste oyster-shells, either NOS or COS, could be used as \nan effective biosorbent for P removal from seawater. Thereby, this biomaterial \ncan sustain a cost-effective and eco-friendly bioremediation strategy with \npotential application in marine RAS. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\"\n\"\n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n1 \n\nTable of Contents \n \n\nI.

Aquaculture: definition, production and culture methods  \n \n\nAquaculture has been defined as the farming of fish and other aquatic organisms by \n\napplying a flexible and adaptable set of technologies, systems and species (Sugunan et al., \n\n2007). It can generally be classified as inland aquaculture or mariculture (cf. Figure 1.6). \n\nInland aquaculture is usually freshwater-based, but some uses saline water in inland areas, \n\ni.e. non-coastal areas. Mariculture includes production operations in the sea/offshore, \n\nintertidal and on-shore zones (FAO, 2014) (Figure 1.1). Some authors, however, consider \n\nmariculture as every system using saltwater.  \n\n \n\n!\n \n\nFigure 1.1. Schematic representation of some aquaculture systems. RAS - Recirculating Aquaculture \nSystem.!\n\n \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n9 \n\n \n\nAquaculture production has been rising in Europe in the last years (Figure 1.2). \n\nGreat differences are noticeable between European countries, not only related with the \n\nproduction density, but also regarding the consumption of fishery and aquaculture products \n\n(Figure 1.3). The highest consumption was recorded for Portugal, comparatively to the \n\naverage observed for 28 European Member States (EU-28, cf. Figure 1.3) or to the \n\nworldwide consumption (18.9 kg/inhabitant/year) (EC, 2014). Overall, farmed products \n\nrepresent 24% of the total European fishery consumption (EUMOFA, 2014). In Portugal, \n\nthe main fish species produced are the turbot and sea bream (Figure 1.4), which have been \n\na consistent selling product of economic importance (Cassamo, 2012). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1.2.

Portugal aquaculture production (in tonnes) by species from 2004 to 2013 (FEAP, \n\n2014). \n\n \n\nThe leading aquaculture-producing countries worldwide rely essentially on inland \n\naquaculture of finfish (FAO, 2014), though mariculture production has been rising in the \n\nlast years (Figure 1.5). This is because the mariculture-farmed finfish includes more \n\nvaluable species than freshwater aquaculture (FAO, 2014). In the European Union, \n\nhowever, the number of marine aquaculture farms is 50,300, whilst inland aquaculture \n\noccurs only in 11,500 farms (Rana &amp; Choo, 2002). \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n11 \n\n \n\n \n\n\"\nFigure 1.5. Inland and mariculture production (million tonnes) in the world from 1980 to 2012 \n\n(FAO, 2014). \n\n!\n!\n!\n\nAquaculture can be characterized in a number of different ways depending on the \n\nenvironment location of the culture (i.e., inland aquaculture versus mariculture), the type \n\nof production system used, the production intensity and the rearing operation designs \n\n(Figure 1.6.). Regarding the production system, it can be considered either land- or water-\n\nbased systems (EP, 2014). The land-based systems are localized inland and use water \n\ncaptures from a different source. These can be categorized as \n\n- ponds: mostly earthen structures with 0.5-1.5 m of depth, covered by waterproof \n\nmembrane or soil to limit water leakage and a water exchange at > 5-30% per day.  \n\n- tanks: made of polythene, polypropylene, concrete or other materials; can sustain \n\nwater volumes of 1m3 to several hundred m3; usually circular or as long rectangles \n\n(raceways); with a water exchange of 0.5-4 L/hour.  \n\n\n\n! 12 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.6.

They involve:  \n\n- cages: generally based on a secured floating collar with a net bag suspended \n\nbelow where the fish is cultured. The mesh size depends on the size of fish. \n\nVolumes can go from 100 to over 20.000 m3.  \n\n- rafts: floating platforms usually made of wood to support ropes that hang down in \n\nthe water, upon which mussels or other bivalves can be attached.  \n\n- longlines: long horizontal ropes fixed to the shore and each end is supported in \n\nthe water with floats. They also have vertical ropes to support shellfish production \n\nbut are cheaper than rafts. \n\n- bottom culture: no containment structures, just management practices used for \n\nmussels, scallops, clams and others. \n\n- bouchot\u2019: wooden poles with rope twisted around and placed in intertidal areas \n\nfor mussel attachment.  \n\n- trestles: plastic mesh bags or trays containing oysters or other shellfish fixed with \n\nsteel to sands in intertidal zones. \n\n- lines: suspended between fixed poles and used for seaweed cultivation, or to \n\nsuspend baskets for shellfish. \n\n \n \n \n\n   \nTrestles \n\n \nFigure 1.7.

For examples, the smaller ponds with less than 500 m2, which are extensively \n\nstocked and fertilized (i.e., extensive and semi-intensive production), can promote the \n\nstability of small-scale systems for household use and local marketing. Depending on the \n\nstocking density and the food source, cages may fall within the extensive, semi-intensive \n\nor intensive categories (Masser, 2012). The highest stocking densities are accomplished in \n\nhyperintensive systems, which may include cages, but also raceways and recirculating \n\naquaculture system (RAS), explained in detailed later.  \n\nThe intensity of production is also associated with the rearing operational designs \n\nthat range from open, to semi-closed and closed systems. Open systems rely on natural \n\nwater movement (i.e., tides) to transport waste products away and bring renewed water. \n\nThese aquaculture systems are developed in natural environments (e.g., lake, rivers, \n\nsea/offshore), namely through the implementation of extensive production conditions. In \n\nsemi-closed systems, the production units are manmade, but still rely on the same level of \n\nhuman labour and water flow factors as those of open systems. Here raceways and ponds \n\nare the major production methods. Closed systems (e.g., RAS), in turn, reuse water and the \n\noperators control most environmental variables in the system (Tidwell, 2012).  \n\nFor certain open systems, the production intensity is a practical indicator of \n\npotential local environmental impacts. Still other parameters like the conditions of the site \n\nand management techniques can contribute to reduce the possible environmental negative \n\neffects of this type of aquaculture systems. However, the production intensity in closed \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n15 \n\nsystems is not necessarily an indicator of its potential environmental impact, e.g., a hyper-\n\nintensive farm using recirculation technology may in part be environmental friendly due to \n\nits lower exchanges with the neighbouring environment compared to other systems (EC, \n\n2012). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.1.2. Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS)  \n!\n!\n\nRAS are a land-based fish farming that treat and re-use wastewater from the tank(s) \n\nwhere the fish is produced, while simultaneously reducing wastes through several filtration \n\nstages. Thus, water can be recycled back into the system without needing a great \n\npercentage of water renewal (Figure 1.8) (Timmons &amp; Ebeling, 2010). In the literature, the \n\nterms recycling and reuse/recirculation are often misled or used without a clear distinction. \n\nRecycling is technically a form of reusing, but it refers to the use of wastewater from the \n\ntanks without undergoing a treatment process. If the wastewater is treated and used again, \n\nthen it is considered a reuse or recirculation system. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.8. Diagram representing the simplified process of a Recirculating Aquaculture System.  \nImage adapted from: http://www.water-proved.de/de/aquakultur/Bilder/Schemata/  \n\n Banner_Kreislaufanlage_1400px_web.jpg \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n16 \n\nOverall, RAS systems have been exploited for the hyper-intensive production of \n\nmany different fish species at any size and life stage. RAS production is generally difficult \n\nto evaluate since the available statistics are limited. However, European RAS production \n\nhas been increasing considerably both in volume and species diversity (Martins et al., \n\n2010). In Portugal, it was estimated a production of 10,000,000 fingerlings (fingerling \n\nheads/year) in 2005 of freshwater and marine species, being the third highest value \n\nobserved for European countries. Additionally, Portuguese RAS grow-out production went \n\nfrom 110 to 112 (MT/year) from 2008 to 2009, being turbot, seabass and sole the major \n\nmarine species produced (Martins et al., 2010). \n\nComparatively to RAS, the conventional aquaculture systems (e.g., outdoor ponds \n\nand cages) are not sustainable in the long term run, not only due to environmental \n\nconcerns, but also because of their limitation to assure the safest products to the \n\nconsumers, free from chemicals and metals, freshly raised and local products (Ebeling &amp; \n\nTimmons, 2012). In fact, RAS offer many advantages over these systems by: \n\n \n\n? reducing water (e.g., saltwater RAS with almost no freshwater inputs compared to \n\ntraditional production systems) and land usage (RAS use less than 1% of land than ponds \n\nand can be explored in areas with poor food production potential, e.g., deserts) (van Rijn, \n\n2013, Zhang et al., 2013) \n\n? reducing shipping costs and transport-related fossil-fuel emissions (i.e., CO2) (Martins et \n\nal. 2010) \n\n? enhancing fish farming by improving culture conditions, feeding efficiency and stocking \n\ndensities (Ebeling and Timmons, 2012) \n\n? reducing impacts on marine ecosystems (e.g., diseases, pollutants) through effluent \n\ntreatment, while avoiding concerns related with the exploration of coastal water areas by \n\nusing on-shore tank systems (Goldberg et al., 2001) \n\n? producing by-products (e.g., N and P contents used as fertilizers) for varied applications \n\n(e.g., agriculture, cosmetics, feeds, industry) (Klinger &amp; Naylor, 2012). \n\n \n\nNotwithstanding, RAS also present disadvantages, despite the availability of \n\nsolutions to overcome them:  \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n17 \n\n? the high cost of feed, labour and operations (Klinger &amp; Naylor, 2012) can be offset by \n\nthe construction of large-scale (>50 MT/year) that would increase labour, processing and \n\ninfrastructures \n\n? the high start-up costs could be counteracted by increasing stocking densities and \n\nproductions (Martins et al., 2010) \n\n? the significant energy requirements (Klinger &amp; Naylor, 2012) could be fulfilled by the \n\nuse of \"green\" energy sources (e.g., solar and wind) \n\n? the potential accumulation of contaminants, fish mortality and disease outbreak from \n\nwater re-use, and feed efficiency can be surpassed by improving N and P removal [e.g., by \n\naltering feed inputs, optimizing beneficial bacterial growth (Klinger &amp; Naylor, 2012), cost-\n\neffective bioremediation solutions that could provide value-added products] \n\n? the tight monitoring of water quality and waste management can be achieved through a \n\nmeticulous design and management of RAS, which involves an efficient feed utilization, \n\nincorporation of treatment methods of recirculating water or discharged wastewater, as to \n\nreduce waste production (van Rijn, 2013). \n\nIn spite of these drawbacks, RAS were partially developed to answer the \n\nincreasingly established environmental regulations at the European [e.g., Water \n\nFramework Directive (EC, 2000); Waste Directive (EC, 2008); Environmental Liability \n\nDirective (EC, 2004)] and national [e.g., Lei da \u00c1gua (AR, 2005), law by decree 236/98 \n\nestablishing criteria and thresholds for water quality according to its uses (MA, 1998)] \n\nlevels, which dictate land and/or water use, protection and/or management (Martins et al., \n\n2010).  \n\n \n\nUnder this context, the efficient remediation of wastewater resulting from RAS \n\nactivities is, hence, an extremely relevant aspect. Before going further, it is important to \n\nclarify the two types of effluents or wastewater normally produced in a RAS system. \n\nConsidering that RAS usually replenish less than 5-20% of its water volume per day \n\n(Summerfelt &amp; Vinci, 2008; EP, 2014) to account for evaporation, solids removal and \n\nother losses (USEPA, 2002), it means that most wastewater (RWW \u2013 recirculating \n\nwastewater) from the production tanks is treated and recycled back to the system. The \n\nremaining wastewater effluents are discharged (DWW \u2013 discharged wastewater) after \n\nbeing remediated. !\n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n18 \n\n1.2 Objectives and structure of the thesis \n!\n!\n This study encloses two main goals. The first one was to revise the available \n\nliterature regarding the remediation methods usually performed to remove or transform the \n\ncontaminants present in marine RAS effluents, also focusing on the bioremediation \n\napproaches applied to phosphates. The second goal intended to explore the bioremediation \n\npotential of a biogenic, biodegradable and nontoxic biosorbent based on oyster-shell waste, \n\nto remove phosphates from artificial seawater. In order to achieve this objective different \n\ninfluencing factors were evaluated to select the optimal conditions for P bioremediation: \n\nshell waste pre-treatment, biosorbent concentration, particle size and equilibration time.  \n\n The proposed aims were fulfilled along the following sections: \n\ni) the first section comprised the introduction of the thesis.  \n\n \n\nii) in the second section it is presented a revision of the literature on marine RAS and \n\n(bio)remediation methods applied for reducing the presence of different contaminants \n\nusually detected in RAS wastewaters, entitled Review: Remediation methods of Effluents of \n\nMarine Recirculating Aquaculture Systems; \n\n \n\niii) the third section entitled Efficiency of shell wastes for the removal of phosphates from \n\nartificial seawater \u2013 an approach to marine recirculating aquaculture systems presents the \n\noutcomes obtained in the different experimental trials conducted under laboratory \n\nconditions. It was prepared in the form of a manuscript to be submitted to a peer-review \n\njournal; \n\n \n\niv) the last section consists in the Final remarks of the study. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n19 \n\n1.3.

Review: Remediation methods of Effluents of Marine \n\nRecirculating Aquaculture Systems \n\n____________________________________________________\"\n\n \n\nAs most marine Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) are set close to the \n\ncoast, wastewater discharge into the sea or even in neighbour streams is still the most usual \n\npractice. While in marine RAS with online wastewater treatment such discharge results in \n\nminor environmental impact, the same does not happen for discharges from RAS with little \n\nor no wastewater treatment (i.e., recirculation aquaculture operations that do not follow \n\nenvironmental regulations). This may cause profound impacts into the receiving \n\nenvironment (van Rijn, 2013), particularly if we consider the accumulation of \n\ncontaminants that may still persist after wastewater treatment whenever applied. In this \n\nregard, water quality control in RAS together with the improvement of available \n\nremediation measures is a crucial part for a successful, eco-friendly and cost-effective \n\noperation. Therefore, in the next sections will be highlighted the contaminants usually \n\ndetected in RAS effluents and which methods are usually applied for their reclamation. \n\n \n!\n2.1. Contaminants in RAS effluents  \n \n\nUneaten feed, excreted metabolites from cultured organisms, pharmaceutical \n\nresidues and water disinfectant agents are common residues in RAS wastewater after each \n\nculture cycle. As a result, many contaminants enter the system and have been detected in \n\nsaltwater RAS effluents (cf. Table 2.1). Some of them are not considered a threat for the \n\naquaculture production and receiving environment (e.g., nutrients, organic matter), unless \n\nthey reach concentrations above the available regulatory levels. Regarding the receiving \n\nenvironment, in particular, if high accumulation of contaminants or negative activities \n\noccur, then direct (e.g., algal blooms triggered by nutrient surplus) or indirect (e.g., pH or \n\ndissolved organic carbon can affect the toxicity of other compounds in water) impacts are \n\nlikely to take place. More specifically, Goldberg et al. (2001) considered five types of \n\npotential effects ranging from biological pollution, contaminated fish used in fish feeds, \n\norganic pollution/eutrophication, chemical pollution to habitat modification. \n\n\n\n! 22 \n\nTable 2.1.

In this context, the remediation procedures performed in RAS for \n\nthe removal of the main concerning contaminants (cf. Table 2.1) from the RWW and/or DWW \n\nmay target all or part of the following major steps (Tucker &amp; Hargreaves, 2008):  \n\n? solid waste removal,  \n\n? nutrient removal/transformation,  \n\n? bacteria/pathogens sterilization, \n\n? carbon dioxide removal,  \n\n? dissolved O2 supplementation. \n\n \n\nA review on the methods applied for major classes of contaminants in RAS effluents is \n\ndeveloped along the next sections. For matters of clarity, this is performed separately for \n\nRWW and DWW.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2. Remediation methods for contaminant removal from RAS effluents \n\n \n\n2.2.1 Recirculating wastewater \n\na. Solid waste removal \n \n\nSolid waste consist of colloid and suspended solid particles of different sizes, which \n\nmay include nutrients and organic matter namely derived from fish excretions and feed \n\nresidues, as well as some pathogens or other non-cultured organisms. Solids removal is one of \n\nthe most critical processes in RAS, since they affect the efficiency of all other downstream \n\nunit processes (Ebeling &amp; Timmons, 2012).  For that, solid particles, are firstly concentrated \n\ninto a sludge, i.e., the concentrated biosolid (Zhang et al., 2013). This may be generally done \n\nby settling or mechanical filtration, being this latter process performed through, for example, a \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n24 \n\nmicroscreen filter. \n\nThe microscreen filters act as a sieve, retaining suspended particles larger than their \n\nmesh size (Ebeling &amp; Timmons, 2012). They are widely used in large-scale RAS designs as \n\nthe primary means for the removal of solids (Cripps &amp; Bergheim, 2000) and have numerous \n\nadvantages, like easy installation and operation, interchangeable screens and varied mesh sizes \n\n(usually 60 to 100\u00b5m) (Malone, 2013). Despite this, screen filters require high maintenance, \n\ncapital and operation costs (Ebeling &amp; Timmons, 2012). Because of reduced efficiency, they \n\ncreate sludge with relatively low concentration of solids (Piedrahita, 2003). Besides, the small-\n\nsuspended solids are not efficiently removed and tend to accumulate afterwards (van Rijn, \n\n1996; Malone, 2013).  \n\nSludge thickening for settling/capture of large solids in basins or ponds, geotextile \n\nbags or belt filters and membrane reactors are also applied in RAS. Notwithstanding, \n\nsettling/sedimentation methods are not recommended as the only path for solids removal from \n\nthe RWW in RAS, because they indeed provide low efficiency in retrieving fine solids. \n\nMoreover, they require more makeup water than screen filters (Piedrahita, 2003). Therefore, \n\nfine particles (<100 \u00b5m) are usually removed by foam fractionation (Timmons &amp; Ebeling, \n\n2010; Riche et al., 2012; Malone, 2013).  \n\nFoam fractionators (also referred as protein skimmers) (Figure 2.1), which can be \n\napplied after mechanical filtration or before oxygenation (cf. Figure 1.8), involve the \n\nadsorption of surfactants in the form of dissolved and fine particles onto bubble surfaces \n\n(Losordo et al., 1998). As bubbles rise through the tube they collect dissolved materials and \n\nfine particles from the RWW, because of the chemical properties of both surfactant and air \n\nbubbles. Briefly, surfactants have a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic end; the hydrophobic end \n\ngoes into the air bubble leaving the hydrophilic end in contact with the water, if this end is \n\nnegatively charged it attracts positively charged materials in the water column, and these \n\npositively charged materials in turn attract negatively charged particles (Timmons &amp; Ebeling, \n\n2010). Bubbles attract, therefore, both negative and positive fine and dissolved solids (and \n\neven bacteria) and when they reach the surface they are removed. It is a simple and \n\ninexpensive method (Timmons, 1994) that complements the solids removal methods via \n\nfiltration or settling (Tucker &amp; Hargreaves, 2008). Additionally, foam fractionators can be \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n25 \n\nused for ozone injection, making them both a solid removal and a disinfection device \n\n(ozonation) all in one unit. They work better in saltwater than in freshwater, because in saline \n\nwater small bubbles are easily formed and foam production is enhanced, since the surface \n\ntension in seawater is higher than in freshwater (Timmons &amp; Ebeling, 2010). Thus, foam \n\nfractionators are widely established in marine RAS (Malone, 2013; Timmons &amp; Ebeling, \n\n2010). Their efficiency is dependent on bubble diameter, the chemical properties of the \n\ncontaminants, the air-to-water ratio and the presence of lipids in the water (which derive from \n\nfish oils in fish feeds and generally reduce foam formation).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.1.

For all these reasons, ozone treatments have \n\nbeen widely applied (Gon\u00e7alves &amp; Gagnon, 2011; Schroeder et al., 2011). However, there are \n\nseveral disadvantages to its usage. Besides being an expensive method, this technique may \n\nlead to the formation of ozone residues that can be lethal to fish even at small concentrations, \n\ndepending on the species and their life stage (Timmons &amp; Ebeling, 2010). An example is the \n\nformation of biocidal oxidants like bromates [e.g., hypobromous acid (HOBr) and \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n26 \n\nhypobromite ions (OBr-)] through the reaction of ozone with bromide ions present in saltwater \n\n(Malone, 2013). These bromates are toxic to fish and shellfish; which makes this technique \n\nproblematic in aquaculture production. Fine suspended material is also removed by biological \n\noxidation, which takes place in most RAS within the nitrifying filters discussed later (van \n\nRijn, 1996).  \n\n!\n!\n!\nb. Oils/Lipids  \n!\n \n\nDespite being hugely overlooked, fish oil from fish feeds is one of the major problems \n\nto deal in the treatment of RAS effluents, which due to its high organic loading, makes \n\ndisposal of oily wastewater a challenging environmental concern. Portuguese admissible \n\nvalues of fat for the discharge of wastewater are 15 mg/L (Table 2.1). However, quantitative \n\ndata on the lipidic content of aquaculture wastewater and its remediation is still deeply \n\noverlooked.  \n\nThe removal of oils/lipids from RWW is usually carried out through a combination of \n\nphysical, chemical and biological approaches (Elleuch et al., 2013). Coagulation\u2013flocculation \n\nis commonly performed by adding compounds (e.g., ferric chloride) to wastewater as to \n\ndestabilize the colloidal materials and allow the small particles to agglomerate into larger \n\nsettable flocs, and therefore can be employed in the solid waste removal phase. Coagulation\u2013\n\nflocculation process may be used as a pre-treatment, enhancing the biodegradability of the \n\ncompounds before the application of a biological treatment. In what concerns biological \n\nmethods, microorganisms can be applied to degrade oils.  \n\nLipase is an enzyme produced by different fungi, bacteria and yeast species that can \n\ntransform lipids into glycerol and fatty acids (Bhumibhamon et al., 2002; Azhdarpoor et al., \n\n2014). The problem is that, fatty acids can inhibit microbial activity because they tend to \n\nattach to the cellular membrane, making it less permeable and, therefore, preventing their \n\nfurther degradation. One reported example is the long chain fatty acids (LCFA) that are \n\nproduced during hydrolysis of triacylglycerol lipids. Oils high in triacylglycerol, such as fish \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n27 \n\noil (95-99% of the lipids therein contained; Torstensen &amp; Tocher, 2010), show low \n\nbiodegradation efficiency, because of the LCFA antimicrobial activity (Elleuch et al., 2013) \n\nwhich tends to result in the accumulation of LCFA.  \n\nBesides the fact that lipase-producing bacteria are considerably ubiquitous, their use on \n\nthe treatment of oily wastewater can be a quite effective technique if the low permeability \n\nissue is solved. Therefore, a combination of coagulation\u2013flocculation process with biological \n\ntreatments turns out to be more successful than the use of these processes alone (Elleuch et al., \n\n2013). But the necessity for two techniques is not ideal, hence new and sustainable alternatives \n\nshould be seek. \n\n \n \n \n\nc. Nitrogenous compounds \n!\n \n\nTotal ammonia-nitrogen (TAN) is a by-product of fish metabolism and is produced \n\nduring bacterial decomposition of solid organic waste (e.g., fish feeds); it consists of un-\n\nionized ammonia (NH3) and ionized ammonia (NH4+); posteriorly this ammonia can be \n\noxidized to form nitrite-nitrogen (NO2-) and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-) (Losordo et al., 1998). \n\nNH3 and NO2? are toxic to fish at low quantities (0.1 and  2 mg/L, respectively), but they can \n\ntolerate fairly high levels of nitrate (>500 mg NO3?/L). However, long-term exposure to \n\nnitrate can be harmful to some fish (van Bussel et al., 2012). Therefore, these compounds are \n\nalso targeted in RAS RWW treatment. Table 2.2 shows the average removal of N compounds \n\nin saltwater RAS RWW and DWW after being subjected to different remediation methods.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n28 \n\nTable 2.2.

In general, biofilters are compartments that include a \n\nsubstrate/medium for microbial attachment and growth, or a section that allows suspended \n\nmicrobial growth for aerobic and anaerobic microbial elimination of wastes (Schreier et al., \n\n2010). The media used in the biofilters must be inert and non-biodegradable (e.g., sand, plastic \n\nor ceramic materials) (Ebeling &amp; Timmons, 2012). These biofilters perform nitrification and \n\ndenitrification by exposing the wastewater to beneficial bacteria. Nitrification is a two-stage \n\nprocess (Figure 2.2).  Firstly, nitrifying bacteria (e.g., Nitrosomonas sp. and Nitrosococcus sp.) \n\noxidize ammonia to nitrite. Secondly,  Nitrospira sp. oxidizes nitrite to nitrate (Gutierrez-\n\nWing &amp; Malone, 2006; Schreier et al., 2010). Many systems rely on a variety of different \n\nmicroorganisms to accomplish denitrification, i.e., the conversion of nitrate into nitrogen gas \n\n(N2) under anaerobiosis (Schreier et al., 2010; Chavez-Crooker &amp; Obreque-Contreras, 2010; \n\nvan Rijn et al., 2006).  \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n29 \n\n \nFigure 2.2. Nitrification and denitrification processes and images of two biofilter designs. Adapted from \n\nSchreier et al. (2010).

Two of them \n\nare: the microbead biofilters and the moving bed bioreactors (Figure 2.2). Microbead biofilters \n\nhave been long used mainly because of their simplicity, low cost and negligible ecological \n\nfootprint. They operate with small plastic beads that float in the system, which gives a high \n\nspecific surface area of contact, what favours microorganism-contaminant contact. For these \n\nreasons, this type of biofilter is usually preferred to other designs. Its main detriment is the \n\ninherently dependence on supplementary addition of O2 to the water flow (i.e., they do not \n\nhave a O2 pumping system incorporated) to maintain aerobic conditions for the \n\nmicroorganisms in the biofilm. Therefore, under low influent dissolved O2, anaerobic \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n30 \n\nconditions will be generated within the biofilter, leading to inadequate nutrient removal due to \n\nmicrobial loss (Ebeling &amp; Timmons, 2012).  \n\nMore recently, moving bed bioreactors have been introduced and are already the most \n\ncompetitive of all the biofilter designs (Ebeling &amp; Timmons, 2012). The media is in \n\nsuspension and is mechanically aerated, which provides effective mixing of microorganisms \n\nwith the effluent (Ebeling &amp; Timmons, 2012), thus contributing to RWW aeration and \n\ndegasification later required. The main advantage of this system is the already integrated O2 \n\naddition system, and the simultaneous provision of carbon dioxide stripping. However, this \n\ntechnique provides low specific surface area and the application of a substrate with higher \n\nsurface area requires more expensive filters. In contrast, microbead biofilters, like previously \n\nsaid, use substrates with high specific surface area, hence triggering lower costs and space \n\nrequirements (Ebeling &amp; Timmons, 2012). \n\nNotwithstanding, the biofiltersapplied to treat saline effluents, as oppose to freshwater, \n\nmay not be effective to remove N compounds because of the inhibitory effect of salinity on \n\nnitrifying and denitrifying bacteria (cf. Yang et al., 1995, Sakairi et al., 1996, Glass and \n\nSilverstein, 1999, S\u00e1nchez et al., 2004) and sometimes concentrations in the effluents surpass \n\nadmissible values (Table 2.1). \n\nA good performance of a marine RAS is strongly dependent on biofiltration efficiency. \n\nBecause of the salinity levels, biofilters still are not completely adequate in removing N \n\ncompounds from saltwater RWW. Data regarding microbial ecology of these \n\nnitrification/denitrification reactors in RAS is still limited and the microbial community in \n\nbiofilters is difficult to control, which becomes the main cause of the limitations in the \n\nbiofiltration phase (Martins et al., 2010). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n31 \n\nd. Phosphorus \n!\n\nBesides N, the excess of phosphorus (P) also greatly contributes for the eutrophication \n\nof aquatic systems. The removal of P is a serious concern that has not yet been sufficiently \n\nsolved (Vohla et al., 2011) (Table 2.3).  \n\n!\nTable 2.3. Average concentration (mg/L) of phosphate (PO4\n\n3--P) before and after different remediation \n\ntechniques in saltwater RAS. \n\n \nnd - not determined. \n\n \n\nPhosphorous has been removed from RWW by biofilters and retention ponds \n\ntechniques. Sharrer et al. (2007) using a membrane biological reactor obtained a total \n\nphosphorus removal of 96.1% in freshwater, but with increasing salinities this rate was \n\nreduced until it reached 65.2% at 32 of salinity of TP. Hussenot et al. (1998) using a retention \n\nlagoon removed 25-52% of phosphates and acknowledge it as a low efficient removal method \n\nfor orthophosphates. \n\nThe efficiency and cost effectiveness of phosphate removal is one of the difficulties in \n\nRAS and quite overlooked, despite some authors obtained acceptable removal after RWW \n\ntreatment (Table 2.3). However, some still don\u2019t reach admissible concentration for discharge \n\n(Table 2.1). Phosphate is usually neglected for RWW, which could lead to accumulation In \n\nDWW. Yet, RAS do not have a specific phosphate removal system in freshwater and saltwater \n\nRAS. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n32 \n\nd. Pathogens  \n \n\nTo kill bacterial, viral, fungal and protozoan pathogens, UV light and ozone gas \n\n(Figures 2.3) are usually employed before water re-enters the system (Schroeder et al., 2011; \n\nGon\u00e7alves &amp; Gagnon, 2011). Foam fractionators, besides removing fine solids, can also \n\nsterilize the effluent, alone or coupled with UV and ozone treatment. \n\nUV lights emit wavelengths that are deadly to microorganisms and the disinfection \n\nrates are normally proportional to the light intensity. If properly sized, UV radiation is \n\neffective. However, the light penetration in the water requires that RAS effluents are not very \n\nturbid as to assure effectiveness. Furthermore, UV light bulbs have to be routinely replaced \n\nevery few months (Malone, 2013). The second method mainly used for disinfection is ozone \n\ngas. Ozone is a very powerful oxidant rapidly absorbed by most recirculating waters. Ozone \n\ndestroys the remaining dissolved organic matter, bacteria, viruses and protozoan organisms. \n\nThe main advantages and downsides of ozone treatment have already been previously \n\nmentioned in solids waste removal. Although the combined use of ozone and UV treatments is \n\nparticularly effective in pathogen removal (Martins et al., 2010), it becomes expensive and \n\nquite demanding in operational terms. \n\n \n\n \n\na)# #b)# #\n \nFigure 2.3.

The main difference between the remediation procedures for DWW and RWW in RAS \n\nis that the latter requires fast acting techniques that guarantee an efficient aquaculture \n\nproduction and safe products. Therefore, more time-consuming (and sometimes cheaper) \n\nmethods can usually be applied to remediate DWW. At the end, the aim is to achieve good \n\nquality emission levels as established in national legislation (e.g., Lay by decree 236/98) in \n\nwhat concerns nutrients (phosphate, nitrates), dissolved organic matter, biological/biochemical \n\noxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total suspended solids.  \n\nA common preliminary treatment approach for both RWW and DWW concerns the \n\nremoval of suspended solids, which is often made in sedimentation basins (USEPA, 2002b). \n\nSettling basins are simple and of low maintenance, and many of the contaminants of concern \n\nin RAS can be partly removed with the captured solids, such as P and N compounds and \n\ndisinfectants. However, these basins require large areas and regular cleaning of accumulated \n\nsolids (Timmons &amp; Ebeling, 2010). Besides, they present reduced efficiency in removing \n\nsmall-sized particles without chemical addition (USEPA, 2002b). Whenever the levels of \n\nnutrients like phosphates and nitrates are not in compliance with the regulated levels, further \n\ntreatment of DWW can be developed in hydroponics (Gorder, 2001) and/or constructed \n\nwetlands (USEPA, 2002a) (cf. following section). Aquaponics (i.e., combination of RAS with \n\nhydroponics; Klinger &amp; Naylor, 2012) and constructed wetlands are still mainly applied in \n\nfreshwater aquaculture effluent treatment (Webb et al., 2012), being their application in \n\nsaltwater quite disregarded. Aquaponics could still be used in the treatment of effluents from \n\nRAS mariculture, as far as a commercially valuable halophytic plants, micro- or macroalgae, \n\ncapable of growing in saline wastewater, are employed (Webb et al., 2012). Such approach \n\nwould benefit from the continuous nutrient-rich discharges from RAS culture tanks (USEPA, \n\n2002a, Klinger &amp; Naylor, 2012), while helping reducing nutrient concentrations towards the \n\nsafe release of DWW in receiving waters. \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n34 \n\nAnother approach to reduce the contaminant burden in RAS DWW is based on \n\nconstructed wetlands. These are man-made or engineered ponds that treat wastewater through \n\nphysical, chemical and biological processes (USEPA, 2002a). Overall, they are a relatively \n\nsimple and low cost technology that uses the ecological interactions of aquatic plants, detritus, \n\nmicrobes and fauna from wetland ecosystems to capture and transform contaminants (e.g., \n\nnutrients) from wastewaters (Lymbery et al., 2006; Sim et al., 2008). As a result, constructed \n\nwetlands have been already implemented for the treatment of different types of effluents (e.g., \n\nmunicipal or domestic sewage, industrial and agricultural wastewater) (Webb et al., 2012), but \n\nthey offer potential for the remediation of saltwater RAS effluents if halotolerant organisms \n\nare used (e.g., halophytes; Webb et al., 2012). In marine RAS there are only a few studies on \n\noperations integrating constructed wetlands and its saline effluent treatment (Lymbery et al., \n\n2006; Webb et al., 2012; Jesus et al., 2014). However, Jesus et al. (2014) using a simulated \n\nconstructed wetland reported nutrient removal efficiencies from the DWW in compliance with \n\nPortuguese regulations. \n\nLarge-scale RAS could economically benefit from their own waste treatment facility, \n\nsuch as a Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) (Gorder, 2001). This procedure has several steps \n\n(Figure 2.4), where both solid and dissolved wastes (e.g., nitrates and phosphates) are treated \n\nin a single container. In the aerobic phase, carbon oxidation and nitrification are accomplished, \n\nand in the anaerobic phase denitrification occurs (Fontenot et al., 2007). SBR allows the \n\ntreatment of RAS wastewater for posterior discharge into adjacent waterways.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.4. Sequencing batch reactor process stages: fill, react, settle, decant and idle (Boopathy et al., \n\n2005). \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n35 \n\n2.3. Digging into the \u201cbio\u201d of phosphate remediation in RAS effluents  \n!\n \n\n \n\nPhosphate is one of the contaminants that is not yet satisfactorily, cost-effectively, \n\nenvironmental-friendly and efficiently removed/transformed with the currently applied \n\nremediation methods (Martins et al., 2010), because high concentrations can be detected in \n\nDWW, which may cause impact in the marine environments. Besides, it has not been pointed \n\nout as a strong limiting factor in fish production, what conversely does not push towards the \n\ndevelopment of new and efficient (bio)remediation measures. Notwithstanding, the levels of \n\nphosphorus usually surpass the regulated levels in RAS DWW (Trepanier et al., 2002; Martins \n\net al., 2009a; Martins et al., 2010). In a closed aquaculture system, it has been shown that \n\nphosphate can be accumulated in concentrations as high as 19.5 mg P/L (Martins et al., \n\n2009a), and after effluent treatment P concentrations were not always below the admissible \n\nvalues for discharge (Table 2.1). Thereby, the release of P-enriched effluents into adjacent \n\ncoastal areas may ultimately trigger the development of eutrophication scenarios, which are \n\nquite harmful for aquatic life (Trepanier et al., 2002). Also, focusing the remediation of RAS \n\nDWW only on the reduction of N compounds is not enough to preclude those scenarios \n\n(Schindler et al., 2008).  \n\nNovel and promising approaches for eco-friendly wastewater treatment in saltwater \n\nRAS are greatly welcomed, and they could involve bioremediation strategies using live \n\norganisms and/or biological materials produced by them. Overall, bioremediation refers to the \n\napplication of biological systems, metabolites or materials to destroy, transform and/or \n\nimmobilize organic and inorganic contaminants (Gadd, 2010).  \n\n \n\n!\n2.3.1. Live organisms \n!\n!\n\nThe metabolic activities of live organisms can be exploited in bioremediation strategies \n\n(Fomina &amp; Gadd, 2014) that may bear on, for example, biosorption, \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n36 \n\ntransformation/degradation, immobilization and bioprecipitation mechanisms, towards \n\ncontaminants removal. Different live organisms may be exploited for this purpose, but in \n\nmarine RAS, however, there is a limiting aspect since only halotolerant or halophilic \n\norganisms can be applied.  \n\nAs such, plants, micro- and macroalgae have been the most used live organisms in \n\nsaltwater RAS for the uptake of P surplus (i.e., assimilatory reaction). Notwithstanding, the \n\nexploitation of these phototrophic organisms (e.g., Brown et al., 1999; Lymbery et al., 2006; \n\nWebb et al., 2012) is usually performed under an integrated scheme of production, named as \n\nIntegrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) systems. In an IMTA, the waste nutrients from \n\nthe higher trophic-level species (e.g., fish) are used for the production of organisms belonging \n\nto a lower trophic-level (e.g., plants). In general, the RAS-IMTA combination can not only \n\nincrease the system productivity through the removal and concentration of solids from the \n\nrecirculating flow, but also reduce the waste outputs in a cost-effective and environmental-\n\nfriendly manner, while producing value-added biomass for different end-uses (Martins et al., \n\n2010; EC, 2012). IMTA usually requires specific infrastructures, such as wetlands, algal ponds \n\nand aquaponic systems (previously described), in which the phototrophic organisms \n\nbioremediate RAS wastewater. !\nWebb et al. (2012), using wetland filter beds with the salt-marsh halophyte Salicornia \n\neuropaea, could remove 67\u00b114% of dissolved inorganic phosphate over 58 days from \n\nwastewater of a marine fish and shrimp farm. However, with a much lower retention time \n\n(0.76 day), Lin et al. (2003) accomplished only 5.4% PO43--P reduction. Waller et al. (2015) \n\nused three halophyte plant species (Tripolium pannonicu, Plantago coronopus and Salicornia \n\ndolichostachya) in hydroponics incorporated in a marine RAS and could retain 7 g of P, which \n\nwas equivalent to 10 % of the P introduced by the fish feed.  \n\nStudies on RAS using macroalgae-based systems for wastewater bioremediation are \n\nstill limited (Schuenhoff et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2007; Mao et al., 2009; He et al., 2014) and \n\nusually focuses on N compounds (Corey et al., 2014; Robledo et al., 2014). Promising results, \n\nhowever, were reported by He et al. (2014), which obtained 77.1% of PO43-P removal using \n\nthe red seaweed Gracilariopsis longissima. Hussenot et al. (1998) observed 47% of PO43--P \n\nremoval using microalgae (diatoms). The use of diatoms is not yet fully studied for treating \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n37 \n\nhigh effluent flow rates, but it shows promising P removal efficiencies and application in \n\nfarms operating as closed systems (Hussenot et al., 1998; Lefebvre, S., 2000). Nevertheless, \n\nBorges et al. (2005) using three classes of microalgae (Prymnesiophyta, Bacillariophyta and \n\nPrasinophyta) were able to achieve PO43--P removal percentages between 97.2 and 99.4% \n\nfrom an effluent of a marine RAS at the laboratory scale. A microalgae pond alternative was \n\nmore recently introduced by Babatsouli et al. (2015), which used a novel immobilized/packed \n\nbed bioreactor with a microalgae Picochlorum sp. inoculum to remove 56-95% phosphates. \n\nDespite the high P removal efficiencies that can be achieved with microalgae, the up-scaling \n\nof such systems requires additional costs, e.g., to prevent disturbing natural populations but \n\nalso, conversely, manage their influence on the bioremediating species, plus the establishment \n\nof an economically attractive use for the resulting biomass. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.2. Biological materials \n!\n!\n\nBiological materials are the components presented or produced by a living organism \n\n(e.g., polymers; cellulose; chitin; ceramic composites, such as shells) (Meyers et al., 2008). \n\nThey can be exploited as bioremediation agents for contaminant, both combined with methods \n\nusing living organisms or even solely.  \n\nThe mechanism most often mediating the bioremediation of contaminants by \n\nbiomaterials regards biosorption. Biosorption is a promising cost-effective clean-up method \n\n(Fomina &amp; Gadd, 2014) that does not generate toxic by-products, is economic and rather \n\nsimple in terms of design and operation (Vakili et al., 2014). It involves the uptake of \n\ncontaminants from aqueous solutions by the biosorbent through metabolism-independent \n\nmechanisms (e.g., physical and chemical adsorption, electrostatic interaction, ion exchange, \n\ncomplexation, chelation) (Aksu, 2005). A chemical adsorbent requires periodic replacement \n\nand recycling, which typically involves high costs and waste production. An alternative \n\nadsorbent should be cost-effective, easily available, environmental-friendly, without thorough \n\npre-processing, easily recycled and effective to meet increasingly stringent environmental \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n38 \n\nquality standards (No &amp; Meyers, 2000). Furthermore, the recycling of wastes as natural \n\nbiosorbents is a strategy lately welcomed and studied. Among them, agricultural biowastes \n\nfrom eucalyptus bark, peanut shells, walnut shells, peach stones, grape seeds and olive waste, \n\nhave been reported as potential biosorbents with application in fish farms for drug residues \n\n(Ferreira et al., 2015). Nevertheless, these biowastes can per se enhance phosphate loads in \n\nwastewater. Shell wastes, however, present better characteristics for P bioremediation in RAS \n\nDWW.   \n\nBivalve-shell wastes are discarded by-products during seafood production and \n\nprocessing industries in many coastal countries (Liu et al., 2009; Ismail &amp; Aris, 2013). Due to \n\nits disposable problems, bivalve-shell wastes make a cheap, available, re-usable, \n\nbiodegradable and desirable adsorbent for marine RAS wastewater treatment studies. In \n\naddition, the recycle concept and regeneration of this biosorbent can also be applied, providing \n\na treatment method with high efficiency potential, also representing a low cost bioremediation \n\nagent. \n\nBivalve shells consist of one or more ceramic phases (e.g., calcite, aragonite) mainly \n\ncomposed by carbonates (Liu et al., 2009; Nakamura et al., 2014). The use of carbonate shells \n\nas a biosorbent has been getting attention due to their ability to control water quality through \n\nthe sorption and precipitation of contaminants (Ismail &amp; Aris, 2013). They have been applied \n\nas media for biological filters (Liu et al., 2010), in oyster-shell-bedded subsurface constructed \n\nwetlands (Yam et al, 2013); as an adsorbent of metals (Blais et al., 2003; Hsu, 2009; Liu et al., \n\n2009; Ismail &amp; Aris, 2013; Alidoust et al., 2015) and P compounds (Kwon et al., 2004; Lee et \n\nal., 2005; Seo et al., 2005; Namasivayam et al., 2005; Currie et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2009; \n\nAbeynaike et al., 2011; Vohla et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2013). However, all \n\nthese applications were directed to freshwater effluents not associated with RAS.  \n\nThe use of bivalve-shells does not have side effects and is not harmful to the \n\nenvironment and humans comparatively to chemical additives usually applied in traditional \n\nmethods of contaminants removal (Ismail &amp; Aris, 2013). Notwithstanding, because they have \n\nthe ability to adsorb several metals from wastewaters, deliberation is necessary when choosing \n\nthe means of disposal/application of the bioadsorbent after effluent treatment to avoid \n\nsecondary contamination. \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n39 \n\nAdsorption of nutrients or other contaminants in aquaculture effluents by these type of \n\nshells has not been explored especially regarding marine RAS, despite their excellent chemical \n\nproperties (Hayes et al, 2008b). As such, additional research is required to study their full \n\nbioremediation potential (Hayes et al., 2008a; Hayes et al., 2008b).  \n\n \n\n \n\n!\n!\n!\n!\n2.4.

Efficiency of shell wastes for the removal of phosphates from \n\nartificial seawater \u2013 an approach to Marine Recirculating Aquaculture \n\nSystems \n\n_________________________________________ \n \n\n3.1. Introduction \n!\n \n\nRecirculating Marine Aquaculture Systems (RAS), including total and semi-\n\nrecirculating/partial-reuse systems, are increasingly becoming more attractive to modern \n\naquaculture (EU, 2014), having the highest production per area and per worker comparatively \n\nto any other aquaculture system (Timmons &amp; Ebeling, 2010; Tidwell, 2012). Besides, its \n\ncharacteristic feature of water reuse/recycling through waste and energy management allows, \n\nin turn, the conservation of energy (to heat water) and make-up water, disease and pollution \n\ncontrol, nutrient recycling and environmentally sustainable production of fresher, safer, and \n\nlocally raised seafood (Martins et al, 2010; Timmons &amp; Ebeling, 2010; Tidwell, 2012). \n\nIn the literature there is little distinction between saltwater and freshwater, but \n\ngenerally RAS can replenish 5-20% of its water volume per day (Summerfelt &amp; Vinci, 2008; \n\nBurut-Archanai et al., 2013). However, the release of wastewater into adjacent water bodies is \n\nlikely to occur. This is particularly worrying because some RAS do not have effective (if \n\nimplemented) discharge wastewater (DWW) treatments, what may represent considerable \n\nthreats for wildlife, local environmental resources and human activities (e.g., bathing, fishing, \n\nirrigation water) (Grigorakis &amp; Rigos, 2011). In fact, certain contaminants have been \n\nquantified in RAS DWW, resulting from fish wastes and unconsumed feed, therapeutics and \n\ntanks clean-up, such as, suspended solids, pharmaceutical residues, dissolved organic matter \n\nand nutrients (P and N compounds) (Piedrahita, 2003). Although part of them seems \n\ninnocuous, high amounts of organic matter and nutrients have a key-role in promoting the \n\noccurrence of, for example, algal blooms that may lead to eutrophication scenarios in valuable \n\nneighbour aquatic systems (Barak et al., 2003). In this context, phosphorus (P) is a major \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n54 \n\ncontributor for such scenarios, which is often neglected in the recirculation water, but must \n\ncomply with national (AR, 2005; MA, 1998) and/or European (EC, 2000; EC, 2008; EC, \n\n2004) regulated levels to allow RAS wastewater discharge (Tal et al., 2009; Martins et al., \n\n2010).  \n\nIn closed aquaculture systems, P can be accumulated up to 20 mg P L-1 (Trepanier et \n\nal., 2002; Martins et al., 2009). Nevertheless, there is a lack of specific phosphorous-removal \n\nsystems in RAS (Martins et al. 2009). Traditional methods of P-removal applied to RAS \n\nDWW are usually based on its precipitation in sedimentation basins (Piedrahita, 2003; \n\nTimmons &amp; Ebeling, 2010). Recently, the use of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture may \n\nhelp removing it by phototrophic organisms (e.g., plants and micro-/macroalgae), which are \n\nproduced as a value-added product (Chaitanawisuti et al, 2011; Webb et al., 2012). \n\nAdditionally, the innovative use of biological treatments, as opposed to the chemical processes \n\nis being favoured (Barak et al., 2003; Burut-Archanai et al., 2013). \n\nThe development of simple and cost-effective bio-based techniques may include the \n\nuse of biosorbents, i.e., the use of live or dead organisms, their components, and/or \n\nbiosynthesized materials to remove substances from solution through different physical and \n\nchemical processes (e.g., adsorption, ion exchange, complexation, chelation). Such \n\nbiotechnological approach has been rendering a promising alternative to bioremediate \n\ndifferent contaminants with a considerable efficiency (Gadd, 2009), namely P, using chitosan \n\n(Chung, 2006) and several agricultural wastes, such as soybean residue \u201cokara\u201d (Nguyen et \n\nal., 2015), pine bark (Karachaliosab &amp; Wazne, 2014), carbon residue that results from wood \n\ngasification (Kilpimaaa et al., 2014), palm surface fibers (Ismail, 2012); coir pith (Krishnan &amp; \n\nHaridas, 2008); sugarcane bagasse (Zhang et al., 2012) and giant reed (Xu et al., 2011). \n\nBiogenic calcium-based materials are also considered to be one promising sorbent for P-\n\nremoval, because they can form stable and insoluble forms with phosphate (Vohla et al., \n\n2011). In particular, oyster-shells are primarily composed of calcium carbonate \n\n(approximately 96%) (Yoon et al., 2003), what enables its use for similar applications. In \n\nmany countries, the increasing production and consumption of oysters is contributing to the \n\naccumulation of oyster-shells in coastal areas as a waste product, both from mariculture or \n\nfood processing industries (Kwon et al., 2004; Namasivayam et al., 2005; Park &amp; Polprasert, \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n55 \n\n2008). Thereby, the recycling of oyster-shell waste in alternative applications is of great \n\nrelevance. Under this context, oyster-shell waste has already been reused as construction \n\nmaterial (Li et al., 2015; Yoon et al., 2003), fertilizer and chicken feed (Kwon et al., 2004). \n\nBut it has also significantly contributed to the removal of phosphates (e.g., Kwon et al., 2004; \n\nLee et al., 2005; Namasivayam et al., 2005; Currie et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2009; Chen et al., \n\n2012), metals (e.g., Blais et al., 2003; Hsu, 2009; Alidoust et al., 2015) and other contaminants \n\n(e.g., Asaoka et al., 2009; Melegari &amp; Matias, 2012) from freshwater. Notwithstanding, the \n\nexploitation of this waste product for P-removal from saltwater effluents resulting from RAS \n\nculture tanks is deeply overlooked.   \n\n  Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to analyse the efficiency of oyster-shell \n\nwaste as a biosorbent for the removal of phosphates from marine RAS DWW. For that, \n\ndifferent factors were evaluated in order to obtain optimal P removal efficiencies in saline \n\nwastewater, namely, oyster-shell pre-treatment, particle size, contact time, biosorbent \n\nconcentration, and initial concentration of phosphate. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2. Materials and Methods \n \n\n3.2.1. Processing, pre-treatment and characterization of oyster-shells  \n \n\nOyster-shells wastes of the species Crassostrea gigas were collected in Ria de Aveiro, \n\nAveiro, Portugal. Sediment and other debris were washed out from the shells, which were then \n\ndried at 60\u00baC. The dried shells were crushed prior to sieving (sieve shaker CISA\u00ae mod. \n\nRP.08) through five sieves of 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 and&lt;0.125 mm, resulting in the fractions F1, \n\nF0.5, F0.25, F0.125 and F<0.125, respectively. These fractions were then subjected to \n\ndifferent pre-treatments, which involved their calcination under an air or argon atmosphere at \n\n900\u00b0C for 3 hours. The aim of using calcinated oyster-shells in this study was to get a material \n\nwith enhanced reactivity for P removal by the decomposition of carbonates into CaO, together \n\nwith the increase of the specific surface area and lowering of the particle size under high \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n56 \n\ntemperatures (Abeynaike et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2013; Alidoust et al., 2015). That way, three \n\nconditions were tested relatively to oyster-shell pre-treatment: i) natural oyster-shell (NOS) \n\nnot calcined, ii) calcined oyster-shell (COS) under air atmosphere, iii) calcined oyster-shell \n\nunder argon atmosphere (AOS). The fractions were stored in a desiccator and prior to each \n\nadsorption experiment they were placed overnight in the oven at 70\u00b0C. \n\n \n\n3.2.2. Experimental setup \n \n\nIn order to test the efficiency of oyster-shell fractions as a biosorbent for P-removal in \n\nartificial saltwater, several assays were sequentially made targeting the influence of specific \n\nparameters or factors. The goal was to select the optimal experimental settings for P-removal, \n\nand progressively reduce the amount of testing conditions within each parameter in the \n\nsubsequent experiments. As such, the first factor concerned the oyster-shell pre-treatment, \n\nwhich was tested by considering the conditions outlined in the previous section, i.e., NOS, \n\nCOS and AOS for the granulometric fraction of 0.125 mm (i.e., F0.125), during 30 minutes at \n\nan initial P concentration ([P]i) of 12 mg L-1 and an adsorbent concentration of 1 g L-1. \n\nSecondly, the effect of particle size and equilibration time was evaluated for all granulometric \n\nfractions of NOS and COS up to 120 minutes exposure time, under the same [P]i , though the \n\nmass loading of the adsorbent was of 50 g L-1 for NOS and 1 g L-1 for COS . Thirdly, for \n\ntesting the effect of the adsorbent dosages, the COS granulometric fraction F1 at 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, \n\n0.25 and 5 g L-1 was studied during 15 minutes exposure and [P]i of 12 mg L-1. Finally, the \n\neffect of [P]i was analysed for the NOS fraction F<0.125 (50 g L-1) and COS fraction F0.5 (1 g \n\nL-1) during 8 hours and 30 minutes, respectively, under  0.05, 0.5, 1.5, 3 and 6 mg P-PO43- L-1.  \n\nAll assays were carried out at room temperature (20\u00b14\u00baC), using a synthetic salwater \n\nphosphate solution prepared by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) (ACS \n\nreagent, Sigma) in marine artificial water (Tropic Marin\u00ae PRO-REEF sea salt) with a salinity \n\nof 24. Each set of test conditions containing the powdered shells was conducted in triplicate, \n\nand the two controls (artificial marine water with crushed oyster-shells subjected to the \n\nrespective pre-treatment, and phosphate solution without the crushed oyster-shells) in \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n57 \n\nduplicate. The assays were performed with continuous agitation at 112 rpm on an end-over-\n\nend shaker (Heidolph Overhead Shakers Reax 2; Heidolph Instruments GmbH &amp; Co. KG, \n\nGermany). After agitation, the samples were filtered (Whatman\u00ae glass microfiber filters, \n\nGrade GF/A, Sigma) being immediately measured the pH and orthophosphate concentration \n\n(i.e., P concentration measured as orthophosphate, cf. section 3.2.3. below) in the filtered \n\nsolution.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.3. Analytical methods \n \n\nThe characterization of the oyster-shells was conducted through the application of \n\ndifferent methods. This characterization was carried out for the oyster-shell fractions \n\n(regarding the pre-treatment and particle size) providing the most efficient P removals \n\naccording to the outcome of the different experimental trials. \n\nThe natural crushed oyster shells were subjected to thermogravimetric and differential \n\nthermal analysis under air atmosphere in the equipment LabsysTM TG-DSC16. The X-ray \n\ndiffraction (XRD) patterns of NOS (F<0.125) and COS (F0.5), before and after P removal \n\nassays, were obtained in the XRD instrument Rigaku Geigerflex, operating at 40 KV/30mA \n\nand equipped with a Cu target. The chemical elements (Ca, Mg, Si, Al, Fe, K, P) in the \n\ncomposition of oyster-shells fractions before (NOS-F<0.125 and COS-F0.5) and after P \n\nremoval experiments were measured in a Thermo X-Series quadrupole ICP-MS (Inductively \n\nCoupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry; Thermo Scientific) equipped with Ni cones and a \n\nBurgener nebulizer, refrigerated with a Peltier system made in a credited laboratory. The \n\nCHN-S (organic carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulfur) analysis was performed in NOS \n\n(F<0.125) and COS (F0.5) fractions under a combustion temperature of 1075\u00baC followed by a \n\nburner temperature of 850\u00baC in a Truspec 630-200-200 CNH-S analyzer.  \n\nP concentration was measured as orthophosphate (P-PO43-) by the ascorbic acid method \n\n(APHA, 1999) and detection limit was calculated (c.f. Supplementary Information). \n\nAbsorbance readings were performed using Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer (Hitachi \n\nInstruments, Inc., Danbury, CT) set at 889 nm. \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n58 \n\n3.2.4. Data analysis \n \n\na. Removal equations \n!\n\nThe sorption capacity (q) and the removal percentage (R) of P by the biosorbent \n\nfractions were calculated using the following equations: \n\n \n\n! = (!0!!)! !  (mg g\n-1)    (1) \n\n! = (!0!!)!0 \u00d7!100  (%)    (2) \n \n\nwhere C0 represents the initial concentration of P in the solution (mg L-1), C is the P \n\nconcentration in the solution after equilibration with oyster shell (mg L-1), V the volume of the \n\nP solution added (0.010 L), and m (g) is the mass of the oyster shell. When equilibrium is \n\nattained, the concentration in solution and the sorption capacity will be designated Ceq and qe, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\n \n\nb. Kinetic models \n \n\nFour models were used to describe P-removal kinetics: the Pseudo-First-Order (PFO) \n\nor Lagergren kinetic model; the Pseudo-Second-Order (PSO) model; the Elovich equation and \n\nthe Intraparticle Diffusion model.  \n\n \n\nThe Pseudo First-Order model (PFO) \n\n \n\nThe Lagergren\u2019s equation (Equation 3) was the first kinetic equation presented to \n\ndescribe the adsorption in solid\u2013liquid systems. It is applied when the rate of occupation of \n\nbinding sites in the sorbent material is proportional to the number of unoccupied sites (Ho, \n\n2004a).  \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n59 \n\n \n\n!t = !e!(1 ? !e!!1!)    (3) \n \n\nwhere, qe and qt are the sorption capacities at equilibrium and at time t, respectively (mg g-1) \n\nand k1 is the rate constant of pseudo-first order sorption (h-1).  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Pseudo Second-Order model (PSO) \n\n \n\nThe pseudo-second-order kinetic model (Ho, 2006) is represented in the integrated \n\nform as shown in Equation 4. \n\n \n\n!t = !!\n!!!!!\n\n!!!!!!!\n!    (4) \n\n \n\nwhere k2 is the rate constant of pseudo second-order adsorption (g mg-1 min-1).  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Elovich equation \n\n \n\nThe Elovich equation assumes that the reacting solid surfaces, such as oyster-shells, \n\nare energetically heterogeneous. The two previous kinetic equations are reaction models. The \n\nElovich equation can be derived from either a diffusion-controlled or a reaction-controlled \n\nprocess (Zhang &amp; Stanforth , 2005). The difference between them lays in the limiting step of \n\nthe adsorption process, which for a diffusion model is the diffusion behaviour into the particle \n\npores; but the rate-determining step in Elovich equation can be either diffusional or chemical. \n\nElovich equation (Chen et al., 2012) is shown as: \n\n \n\n!t = !\"!!!\u00d7!!!!! +\n!\n!!\n+ ln!   (5) \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n60 \n\nwhere ae is the initial adsorption rate (mg g-1 min-1) and, be is related to the distribution of \n\nactivation energies and the extent of surface cover (Zhang &amp; Stanforth , 2005; Cerofolini et \n\nal., 1996). \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Intraparticle Diffusion model \n\n \n\nThe Intraparticle model is a diffusion kinetic model. The intraparticle diffusion model \n\n(Weber &amp; Morris, 1965) is originated from Fick\u2019s second law and is expressed as: \n\n \n\n!t! = !i!!!/! + !   (6) \n \n\nwhere ki is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant (mg(g h)-1/2) that can be obtained from the \n\nslope of the plot qt vs. t1/2 and C (mg g-1) is a constant indicative of external mass transfer as \n\nbeing significant in the sorption, thereby acting as the rate-controlling step. When the line q \n\nversus t does not pass by the origin (C?0) that means that intraparticle diffusion is not the only \n\nrate limiting mechanism \n\n  \n\n \n\nc. Adsorption isotherms \n \n\nLangmuir (Equation 7) and Freundlich (Equation 8) adsorption isotherms were applied \n\nto the experimental equilibrium adsorption data. The Langmuir isotherm model assumes an \n\nentirely homogeneous surface, where sorption has the same activation energy. On the other \n\nhand, the Freundlich isotherm model fits highly heterogeneous surfaces (Chen, 2013). \n\n \n\n!e = !\"L!eq1+!L!eq    (7) \n\n!e = !F!!!\"!     (8) \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n61 \n\nWhere the Langmuir constants Q (mg g-1) and kL (mg g-1) are the maximum adsorption \n\ncapacity at the temperature of the isotherm and the adsorption equilibrium constant, \n\nrespectively, while the Freundlich constants kF (mg g-1) and N have a less defined physical \n\nmeaning and are usually related, in case of kF to the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and \n\nN is related to energy and intensity of adsorption.  \n\n \n\nd. Statistics and software  \n \n\nNon-linear regression analysis, for fitting models to experimental data, was made using \n\nthe program GraphPadPrism6\u00ae (Trial version; http://www.graphpad.com; last accessed on \n\n10th June 2015).  \n\nVariance analysis (ANOVA) and pairwise multiple comparisons of means were \n\nperformed using IBM SPSS software package, version 20. The level of significance 0.05 was \n\nused. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3. Results and Discussion \n \n\n3.3.1. Chemical characterization of the crushed oyster shells \n \n\nSince different pre-treatments based on the calcination of raw oyster shells were \n\nevaluated, the primary analysis of the material regarded its thermogravimetric behaviour \n\n(Figure 3.1). The TGA/DTA analysis allows testing the influence of temperature and heating \n\nair atmosphere on the physical and chemical properties of the biomaterial. The decomposition \n\npattern obtained for NOS indicated that its calcination initiated at 710\u00baC, being completed at \n\n863\u00b0C (Figure 3.1). The correspondent weight loss under air atmosphere was of 42%, which \n\nwas due to the conversion of CaCO3 at 863\u00baC following the reaction CaCO3?CaO+CO2. \n\nOther studies obtained slightly lower onset and peak temperatures, which were approximately \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n62 \n\n645-650\u00baC and 780-900\u00baC, respectively (Kown et al., 2004; Choi et al., 2011). The DTA \n\nprofile evidenced an exothermic change with a peak at 849\u00baC, immediately followed by an \n\nendothermic reaction.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 Thermogravimetric (TGA) (expressed as % weight loss) and differential thermal (DTA) \n\nanalyses of natural oyster-shell (fraction F0.5) under air atmosphere \n\n \n\nThe XRD profile of NOS showed that calcite (CaCO3) was the major crystal phase, \n\nthough quartz (SiO2) was also detected (Figure 3.2). This outcome is in line with other studies \n\n(e.g., Kown et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2010; Alidoust et al., 2015) despite that SiO2 was reported \n\nonly by some authors (e.g., Yu et al., 2010). The resemblance of our results with those of the \n\nliterature is not surprising, considering that natural oyster shells are originally from similar \n\nenvironments and present analogous characteristics (Yoon et al., 2003). The calcination of \n\ncrushed oyster-shell provoked deep changes in the chemical and crystal characteristics of the \n\nraw material (Figure 3.2).  \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n63 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 \u2013 XRD patterns for NOS (natural oyster-shell, F<0.125) and COS (calcinated oyster-shell \n\nunder air atmosphere, F0.5) samples.

Other studies obtained \n\nsimilar decomposition of oyster shells calcined under air atmosphere at 750\u00baC (Kown et al., \n\n2004; Yu et al., 2010) and 900\u00baC (Alidoust et al., 2015). \n\nThe elemental composition of NOS and COS determined by ICP-MS evidenced that \n\nCa is highly represented in NOS and, mainly, in COS (Table 3.1).

(2009) \n\nreported lower concentrations of Fe, K and Mg (0.009, 0.02, 0.94 mg g-1, respectively), but \n\nhigher Ca content (404 mg g-1) in crushed oyster-shell powder, determined by ICP-AES. \n\n \n\nTable 3.1 \u2013 Chemical composition (mg g-1) of crushed oyster-shells determined by ICP-MS, before \n\n(NOS and COS) and after (NOS+P and COS+P) phosphate removal experiments  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNOS \u2013 non-calcinated oyster-shell (fraction F<0.125); COS \u2013 calcinated oyster-shell under air atmosphere \n(fraction F0.5); P \u2013 phosphorous.

From these \n\nelements, only a small amount of carbon was measured in COS.

The effect of pre-treatment \n!\n \n\nPhosphate removal efficiency in saltwater was compared in NOS and in the two pre-\n\ntreatments consisting of calcination under air atmosphere (COS) and argon (AOS) (Figure \n\n3.3). Calcination of oyster shells under air or under an inert gas (e.g., argon or nitrogen) may \n\nprovide different results. Pyrolysis under an inert gas atmosphere leads to increased mass loss \n\nrelatively to air calcination, which in turn means further thermal decomposition of the material \n\nand higher reactive surface area (Know et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2009). For this reason, the \n\nefficiency of COS and AOS was evaluated in this first trial. \n\nPreliminary assays using high and low adsorbent concentrations demonstrated that 1 g \n\nL-1 was sufficient to accomplish almost complete P-removal in pre-treated oyster-shells (cf. \n\nFigure 3.4). Similar conclusions were made regarding the exposure time, which for COS it \n\nappeared that the equilibrium occurred approximately after 30 minutes. For comparison \n\npurposes the same parameters were applied for NOS.  \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n66 \n\n \nFigure 3.3. Comparison of removal percentage (R), adsorption capacity (q) and phosphate \n\nconcentration in saltwater solution (C) for argon-calcined (AOS), air-atmosphere calcined (COS) and \n\nnatural oyster-shells not subjected to calcination (NOS). Experimental conditions: samples fraction \n\nF0.125, 30 minutes exposure, initial P concentration of 12 mg L-1 saltwater, adsorbent concentration of \n\n1 g L-1. \n\n \n\n  \n\nNOS displayed a removal efficiency of 9.3\u00b12.3%, an adsorption capacity (q) of \n\n1.1\u00b10.3 mg g-1 and a P concentration (C) of 10.8\u00b10.3 mg P L-1. In COS, 97.5\u00b10.6% of P was \n\nremoved with a C after 30 minutes of 0.25\u00b10.10 mg P L-1 and a q of 11.6\u00b10.1 mg g-1. For \n\nAOS, the concentration of phosphate was below the detection limit (cf. section 2.5. of  \n\nSupplementary Information); which corresponds to ?98.1% of P-removal, a ?0.22 mg P L-1 of \n\nC and q of ?11.8 mg g-1. The solution pH was 7.8, 9.5 and 10.2 in NOS, COS and AOS, \n\nrespectively. \n\nKown et al. (2004) achieved a consistent trend with ours, since the P removal they \n\nobtained from standard solutions (not in saltwater) was greater for pyrolised oyster-shells (at \n\n650-800\u00baC) under nitrogen atmosphere (up to 98%) comparatively to air-calcined (at 750\u00baC; \n\nca. 68%) and raw (<10%) oyster shells (5g L-1 adsorbent, 30 mg P L-1 and 30 minutes \n\nexposure). In another study, Lee et al. (2009) used oyster shells pyrolyzed under nitrogen \n\natmosphere at 750\u00baC and attained 98% phosphate removal (0.6 g adsorbent L-1, initial \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n67 \n\nconcentration of 11.9 mg P L-1 and 30 minutes exposure). \n\nAs such, the removal efficiency of AOS is somewhat similar to COS. Not only that, the \n\npH in AOS treatment appears to be even higher than in COS after remediation, which is not \n\ndesirable when considering the discharge of saltwater wastewater into the environment (Vohla \n\net al., 2011). Additionally, calcination with argon atmosphere showed to be an expensive and \n\nless efficient pre-treatment method, regarding both the equipment and energy required, and the \n\nextremely low amount of sample that can be processed in each pyrolysis cycle. For these \n\nreasons, this pre-treatment abandoned and the upcoming assays only used NOS and COS.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3.3. The effect of size particle and equilibration time on P-removal \n!\n \n\nNOS and COS were evaluated for their capacity to remove phosphate from saltwater \n\n(Figure 3.4). Among the five granulometric fractions, the smallest (F<0.125) shows the \n\nhighest phosphate removal in both NOS (56.3\u00b10.5%) and COS (? 98.1%) after 120 minutes, \n\ngiving rise to a decrease of P concentration in solution from the initial value of 12 mg L-1to \n\n5.30\u00b10.06 mg L-1 for NOS and values lower than the limit of detection (?0.22 mg L-1) for \n\nCOS. This corresponds to adsorption capacities of 0.137\u00b10.001 and ? 11.8 mg g-1, \n\nrespectively. Particle size effect was very evident; as the particle size decreased, the phosphate \n\nuptake capacity (q) increased with the best phosphate removals achieved with the smallest \n\ngranulometric fractions, which is in consensus with previous works (Lee et al, 2005; Lee et al, \n\n2009; Park  &amp; Polprasert, 2008a; Chen et al., 2012) and it may be explained by the fact that \n\nsurface area increases as the particle size decreases. As expected due to previous studies \n\n(Abeynaike et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2005; Kwon et al. 2004; Vohla et al., 2011; Currie et al., \n\n2007), CaO from COS appears to be more efficient in removing phosphate from water than \n\nCaCO3 from NOS (Figure 3.4). Besides Namasivayam et al. (2005) who reported that NOS did \n\nnot remove any phosphates, other studies (Kwon et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2005; Currie et al., \n\n2007; Abeynaike et al., 2011), like ours, also accomplished P-removal using raw oyster or \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n68 \n\nmussel shells (NOS). Namasivayam et al. (2005) do not specify whether the NOS were \n\ncrushed, which could explain the result disparity, since surface area is an important parameter \n\nfor adsorption. For COS, the sorption of P was very rapid - attaining very high values in the \n\nearly seconds - regardless of the different particle sizes suggesting that precipitation may be a \n\nkey removal mechanism (Lee et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2013). This occurred faster than \n\nreported by other authors (Kwon et al., 2004; Currie et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2005) where more \n\nthan 90% removal percentage occurred between 5-30 minutes, but some of those authors did \n\nnot use contact times as short as ours. After the very rapid initial removal, adsorption capacity \n\nin COS continued to increase, although at a slower, but still high rate (notice the variation of x \n\nscale in the graphics of Figure 3.4 for COS). Equilibrium occurs after 15 minutes for F<0.125 \n\nand 30 minutes for the other fractions.  In NOS, equilibrium appears not to be reached after 2 \n\nhours (Figure 3.4a). After a rapid initial increase, the adsorption capacity continues to increase \n\nat much slower rate. This much slower increase suggests the existence of abundant pores, \n\nwhich allows water and P penetration within the adsorbent, thus adding to the adsorption \n\ncapacity (Kwon et al., 2004). However, because the rate of increase is very slow, removal at \n\n120 minutes can be considered at pseudo-equilibrium (Hojati &amp; Khademi, 2013; Owabor et \n\nal., 2010).  \n\nTable 3.3 compares the some removal percentages obtained by other authors for \n\nsolutions of phosphate in distilled water, with the removal percentage obtained in the present \n\nwork using artificial seawater. The percentage removal obtained in the present work is in \n\naccordance with previous studies, suggesting that ionic strength and salinity do not adversely \n\ninfluence the P-removal onto oyster-shells.  \n\nThe removal percentage in NOS obtained by Currie et al. (2007) was somewhat similar \n\nto the present study despite a lower concentration of oyster shell powder and exposure time, \n\nwhich are factors that should contribute to a lower percentage removal (cf. sections 3.3.4 and \n\n3.3.6). This may be explained by the smaller granulometric fraction (0.038-0.075 mm) applied \n\nby Currie et al (2007), since P-removal increases when fraction size decreases. On the other \n\nhand, Kwon et al. (2004), using the same parameters as Currie et al. (2007), reported only \n\n15% of P-removal, but without specifying the granulometric fraction used. Lower removal \n\npercentages are also reported by Chen et al. (2012), who used fractions similar to\n\n\n\n! 69 \n\n \n\na.  b.  c.  \n\nd. e.  f.  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4.

The lower removal percentages obtained by Chen et al. (2012) relatively \n\nto Currie et al (2007) may be attributed to the difference of granulometry of the \n\nadsorbent, while the much lower percentage removal relatively to our results may be \n\nattributed to the higher adsorbent concentration used in the present work. However, Chen \n\net al (2012), even with the smallest fraction, obtained a P-removal of 16%, which is \n\nsignificantly lower than the one achieved by Kwon et al. (2004) using similar adsorbent \n\nload.  \n\nIn what concerns COS, and analogously to the results obtained in this work, Lee \n\net al. (2009) using similar parameters and fractions sizes, such as 0.36-0.6 mm (~ F0.25) \n\nand 0.6-1 mm (~ F0.5), accomplished >99% P-removal. Additionally, similarly to this \n\nstudy total P-removal in COS was achieved somewhat fast for all fractions. The results \n\nobtained by Lee et al (2009) and also in the present work, suggest that a much smaller \n\nadsorbent concentration should be effective. However, studies by Kwon et al. (2004) and \n\nCurrie et al. (2007), despite the similar assay conditions among them reported 68% and \n\n90% of P-removal, respectively. Once again there is no mention of granulometric size by \n\nthe first. The absence of relevant information in the literature limits the discussion and \n\ncomparison of the results. \n\nFigures 3.4c and 3.4f show the variation of pH along time. The initial phosphate \n\nsolution of 12 mg P L-1 has a pH 7.3. In Figure 3.4c and 3.4f, t=0 corresponds to the \n\nsolution pH immediately after contact with the adsorbent. pH in NOS initially increases \n\nfast, reaching a pH 7.5-7.9 and continuing to increase at a slower rate until pH 7.8-7.9. The \n\nsame happens in COS, where almost immediately a pH 9-10 is attained followed by small \n\nvariations that moreover keep the pH at 9.7-10. Higher pH in COS denotes a high \n\nconcentration of HO- due to the dissolution of CaO (Equation 9) versus a low concentration \n\nof HO- in NOS from dissolution of CaCO3 (Equation 10), additionally confirming that CaO \n\nhas been formed in COS (cf. XRD Figure 3.2). These results are comparable to those \n\nobtained by Abeynaike et al., (2011) who reported final pH ranges of 11.4-12.6 in \n\npyrolysed mussel shells and 7.7-7.9 in NOS; and by Lee et al., (2005) who found pH>11 \n\nfor pyrolysed shells and pH 8.5 for NOS. With increasing pH, the phosphates in the water \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n72 \n\n(or orthophosphates) may be present in different forms (Equation 11). Consequently, in the \n\ncase of exposure to COS, these different orthophosphate ions can react with the Ca2+ and \n\nOH- ions (Equations 9), thereby forming a variety of calcium phosphates. However, the \n\ninsoluble precipitate hydroxyapatite (Equation 12) is the most thermodynamically stable \n\nform of calcium phosphate (Nancollas et al., 1978). In order to hydroxyapatite precipitate \n\nthe solution needs a pH above 10 (Abeynaike et al., 20011). High pH favours a sufficient \n\nsupply not only of OH- ions but also of PO43- ions (Equation 11). In COS, this condition \n\nwas apparently reached in F1 after 60 minutes, in F0.5 after 10 minutes and in F0.25, \n\nF0.125 and F<0.125 after only 3 minutes of exposure (3.4.f). Abeynaike et al. (2011) \n\nreported that this precipitation could be homogenous, where phosphate precipitates in \n\nsolution, or heterogeneous, by precipitating on the surface of the adsorbent. \n\n \n\nCa OH 2! ?

Lee et al (2009) demonstrated that the precipitation of \n\nphosphate with pyrolysed oyster shells (750\u00baC, 1h, under N2) occurs homogeneously and with \n\nno adsorption of phosphate. However, heterogeneous precipitation of phosphate at the surface \n\nof the adsorbent has also been proposed as a removal mechanism (Abeynaike et al, 2011).  \n\nSome authors (Currie et al, 2007; Abeynaike et al, 2011) have shown that, during pyrolysis of \n\noyster shell powder at 750 and 800\u00baC, CaCO3 can be only partially converted into CaO, giving \n\nrise to particles which, due to a shrinking core mechanism in the pyrolysis, will have an outer \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n73 \n\nsurface of CaO and an inner unreacted calcite core. Abeynaike et al. (2011) have also shown \n\nthat, for smaller particles, more CaCO3 is transformed into CaO, leaving a smaller core of \n\nCaCO3. CaO dissolves and homogeneous or heterogeneous precipitation can occur. According \n\nto Abeynaike et al. (2011), heterogeneous precipitation of hydroxyapatite onto CaCO3 is much \n\nfaster than homogeneous precipitation. Besides, when the pyrolysis does not achieve full \n\nconversion to CaO, there is the potential of a dual mechanism where the phosphate could both \n\nadsorb and precipitate. According to the characterization of COS presented in section 3.3.1, \n\nthe conversion of CaCO3 into CaO was complete and precipitation must be the removal \n\nmechanism by COS. ! \nAlthough Abeynaike et al. (2011) refers that phosphate can be removed by \n\nprecipitation or sorption onto oyster-shells, the potential sorption mechanism of phosphates by \n\nthe oyster shells is the least understood. However, because CaCO3 is more insoluble compared \n\nto CaO it is expected that the key phosphate-removal mechanism for natural oyster-shells \n\n(NOS) is the absorption and/or adsorption (Abeynaike et al., 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3.3.1. Kinetics of phosphorus removal  \n \n \n\nThe four models presented in section 3.2.4.b were used to describe P-removal kinetics. \n\nThe equations of the models were fitted to the average values of the three replicates of the \n\nadsorption data shown in Figure 3.4. For removal by NOS, different ways of data input for \n\nanalysis were evaluated, namely, the use of all exposure times studied or shorter exposure \n\ntimes with a higher contribution of the fast initial removal of phosphate (c.f. Figure 3.4). For \n\nCOS, as the equilibrium is attained very fast, the kinetic equations were fitted to the data \n\ncorresponding the time interval 0-30 min. Tables 3.4 and 3.5 show the parameters of the \n\nmodels fitted to the data for NOS and COS, respectively.

Kinetics of phosphorus removal by NOS \n!\n\n \n\nThe PFO model did not represent the kinetics of phosphorus sorption as well \n\nas the other models for NOS. A higher value of R2 (0.9898) was reported by \n\nNamasivayam et al (2005) who concluded that phosphate adsorption onto NOS was \n\nwell expressed by this model, but the authors did not compare with other models. The \n\nsame conclusion was made by Asaoka et al., (2009), regarding hydrogen sulphide \n\nadsorption (R2= 0.94 - 0.993). Other studies reported that the PSO model is the best \n\nmodel for adsorption kinetics of phosphate onto NOS (Chen et al., 2012), when \n\ncompared to Elovich and Intraparticle Diffusion models, indicating that \n\nchemisorption may play a significant role in the adsorption process of phosphate onto \n\nNOS. In the present work, this model did not fit the data so well, mainly for the \n\nsmallest fractions. However, the sorption capacity (qe) predicted by the model agrees \n\nvery well with the experimental data and rises when granulometic fraction size \n\ndecreases; but PSO rate constant, k2, seems not to follow any pattern among fractions, \n\nreaching its maximum with F1 (2,363 g mg-1 min-1).  \n\nThe Elovich model appears to be one of the best-fit models for NOS (Figure \n\n3.5), with better R2 values, higher than 0.94, for short time intervals, corresponding to \n\nthe faster initial increase of adsorption.  \n\nThe Intraparticle Diffusion model seems to be also a very good fit for NOS \n\n(Figure 3.5), particularly when using data from 0 \u2013 120 min, recording R2 values \n\nbetween 0,9066 and 0,9971 (Table 3.4b). Moreover, ki, the intra-particle diffusion rate \n\nconstant, decreases as the fraction size increases, probably due to the existence of less \n\naccessible pores in the interior of the adsorbent particles. As can be seen in Figure \n\n3.5, the line of the Intraparticle Diffusion model does not pass through the origin, \n\nsuggesting that Intraparticle Diffusion is not the only rate limiting mechanism and a \n\nfaster adsorption occurs for short contact times.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n77 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.5. Plots of the Elovich model and Intraparticle Diffusion model for NOS analysed \n\nwith average values from 0 to 120 min and from 0 to 75 minutes.  \n\n \n\nThus, the kinetics of sorption onto NOS is better modelled by the Elovich and \n\nthe Intraparticle Diffusion models, with the former fitting better the data for shorter \n\ntime intervals and the latter fitting better the data for a larger time interval. This \n\nsuggests that more than one kinetic mechanism plays a role in the phosphate \n\nadsorption process onto NOS and that the removal is both a diffusional and \n\nchemically rate-controlled process, with a fast initial chemical sorption at accessible \n\nsites at the surface, probably with some heterogeneity of binding energies, as assumed \n\nby the Elovich model, and a sorption into the pores occurring mainly during the slow \n\nincrease of sorption for longer exposure times, which rate is at least partially \n\ncontrolled by the diffusion rate. .  \n\n \n\n \n\n0 \n\u2013 \n\n12\n0 \n\nm\nin\n\nu\nte\n\ns \n0 \n\n\u2013 \n75\n\n m\nin\n\nut\nes\n\n \nElovich model Intraparticle Diffusion model \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n78 \n\nb. Kinetics of phosphorus removal by COS \n \n\nIn the case of homologous precipitation, the kinetic models usually used to \n\ndescribe adsorption at a solid surface may be not adequate.  \n\nAnalysing the results of Table 3.5 for the fitting of the several models, it is \n\nclear that the PFO and PSO models are inappropriate to fit the kinetics of P-removal \n\nby COS, giving rise to abnormal values for R2 when granulometric fraction size \n\ndecreases. These models only fitted reasonably well to the data for F1.  \n\n The Elovich model is the kinetic model that best fits phosphate removal by \n\nCOS (Figure 3.6), with R2 values between 0.906 and 0.956 (Table 3.5) for all size \n\nfractions with the exception of F<0.125. As previously concluded, removal efficiency \n\nincreases with the decrease in granulometric size (Figure 3.4) and alongside, the \n\nsmaller the fraction, the faster the P-removal occurs meaning that equilibrium may be \n\nachieved in COS F<0.125 too fast for the model curve to adjust properly. Besides, for \n\nthose very short times, the uncertainty is higher due variations in contact time, since \n\nthe time needed to filter the samples is not very much lower than the time during \n\nwhich the suspensions of COS in phosphate solution were shaken.   \n\n \n\n \n\na.  b.  \n\nFigure 3.6. Plots of the PSO (a) and Elovich (b) models for COS \n\nIn what concerns the Intraparticle Diffusion model, R2 values from Table 3.5 \n\nindicate that this model does not fit the data for COS.  This is coherent with the \n\ncalcination process that was applied, which increases the pore size of the sample \n\n(Alidoust et al., 2015), allowing easier penetration of the adsorbate and making \n\ndiffusion not a rate-controlled removal process.  \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n79 \n\n3.3.4. The effect of P concentration on its removal \n \n\n \n\nThe P-removal ability of oyster-shells was evaluated for different initial \n\nconcentrations of P, using an adsorbent density of 1g L-1 for COS and 50 g L-1 for \n\nNOS (Figure 3.7).   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.7. Removal percentage in NOS and COS over time for initial concentrations of 0.5, \n\n1.5, 3 and 6 mg P L-1. Experimental conditions: adsorbent concentrations of 1g L-1 for COS \n\n(F0.5) and 50 g L-1 for NOS (F<0.125) with exporure times of 30 and 480 minutes, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\n \n\nFor COS, the equilibrium is reached very fast (within 5-10 minutes) and P \n\nconcentrations after attaining the equilibrium were below the detection limit, which \n\ncorresponded to a P removal of ?92%, ?97.3%, ?98.6% and ?99.3%, for 0.5, 1.5, 3 \n\nand 6 mg P L-1, respectively. These results are in agreement with precipitation \n\n(homogeneous and/or heterogeneous) as the removal mechanism and also with the \n\nremoval percentage obtained for an initial concentration of 12 mg L-1 (cf. section \n\n3.3.3). Thus, for the concentrations from 0.5 to 12 mg P L-1, which are within the \n\nrange usually found in RAS DWW, the removal percentage of phosphorus with 1 g L-\n\n1 of COS is higher than 92%. \n\nFor NOS after 8 hours, P-removal is 80.0\u00b11.5%, 83.7\u00b10.1%, 77.8\u00b14.3% and \n\n70.7\u00b10.5% for 0.5, 1.5, 3 and 6 mg P L-1, respectively. Comparison of the mean \n\nNOS COS \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n80 \n\nvalues by one way ANOVA, followed by Tukey test for pairwise comparison, showed \n\nthat the percentage removals of P for the first three concentrations are not \n\nsignificantly different, but the removal for 6 mg P L-1 is lower than for the other \n\nconcentrations. This behaviour suggests that, at this concentration, the depletion of \n\nbinding sites reduces the extent of adsorption, which is characteristic of Langmuir \n\nisotherm model. Since adsorption appears to be the mechanism responsible for \n\nphosphate removal in NOS, adsorption isotherm models were adjusted to NOS data \n\nonly. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3.5. Adsorption isotherms \n \n\nUsing the data of qe and Ceq after 8h of equilibration from experiments \n\ndescribed in the previous section, the variation of the equilibrium adsorption capacity \n\nof NOS versus equilibrium concentration of phosphorus was obtained. Langmuir \n\n(Equation 7) and Freundlich (Equation 8) adsorption isotherms were fitted to the \n\nexperimental equilibrium adsorption data. The experimental data and the curves fitted \n\nto de data for NOS are shown in Figure 3.8.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.8. Adsorption isotherms of phosphate in NOS. The same conditions as \u201cThe effect of \n\ninitial P concentration\u201d with the exposure time of 8h were used. \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n81 \n\nRegarding the fitting of isotherm equations, it is still very common to find in \n\nthe literature a variety of adsorption studies that use the linearized forms of the \n\nisotherms and all adsorption studies discussed here that use oyster-shells applied \n\nlinearization (Namasivayam et al., 2005; Seo et al., 2005; Hsu et al., 2009; Asaoka et \n\nal., 2009; Melegari &amp; Matias, 2012; Chen et al., 2013; Alidoust et al., 2015). \n\nHowever, several studies have already reported the problems associated with the \n\nisotherm equation linearization methods and suggested that isotherm data should be \n\nadjusted to Freundlich and Langmuir original equations by non-linear regression \n\nanalysis, which gives the better values for the isotherm parameters (Filipe, 2012). As \n\nreferred by Ho (2004b), \"the conversion of non-linear isotherm equations to linear \n\nforms implicitly alters their error structure and may also violate the error variance \n\nand normality assumptions of least squares method\". That being said, adsorption \n\nisotherms were fitted in their non-linear form for the first time in oyster-shells. \n\nEquations 7 and 8 were fitted to the average data of three replicates. \n\nThe Langmuir and Freundlich calculated constants are shown in Table 3.6.  \n\n \n\nTable 3.6. Equilibrium isotherm model parameters for Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm \n\nmodels applied to NOS. The same conditions as \u201cThe effect of initial P concentration\u201d with \n\nthe exposure time of 8h were used. \n\n \n\n \n\nFor NOS, a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.996 indicates that the \n\nremoval process is better fitted by the Langmuir model, suggesting a monolayer \n\nadsorption. However an R2 of 0.990 for Freunlich model also shows a good \n\nadjustability (Table 3.6). According to the Langmuir model, the maximum adsorption \n\ncapacity (Q) of NOS is 0.144 mg g-1. This is approximately the value obtained for the \n\nexperiments with an initial P concentration of 12 mg L-1 as described in section 3.3.3. \n\nThus, with a NOS concentration of 50 g L-1, the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent \n\nis exhausted for a [P]i of 12 mg L-1.  In Freundlich model the value of N was lower \n\nthan 1, revealing that adsorption was not a favourable process (Hsu et al., 2009; Chen \n\nLangmuir Freundlich \n! (mg g-1) kL  (mg g-1) R2 kF (mg g-1) N R2 \n\n0.1444 \u00b1 0.0164 0.7363 \u00b1 0.1524 0.996 0.0577 \u00b1 0.0024 0.663 \u00b1 0.063 0.990 \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n82 \n\net al., 2013). Additionally, the low value of kF  (0.0577 mg g-1) in Freundlich model \n\nsuggests a low affinity of NOS to phosphate (Melegari &amp; Matias, 2012). These results \n\nagree with the study from Seo et al, (2005), that also reported a good fit of Langmuirs \n\nmodel in P-adsorption onto NOS. Different results were reported by Namasivayam et \n\nal., (2005), that concluded that phosphate adsorption onto NOS obeys the Freundlich \n\nisotherm (with constants, kF = 19.47 and N = 1.02), However, the authors obtained a \n\nlower R2 (R2 = 0.87) and did not test other isotherm models. Asaoka et al., (2009), on \n\nthe other hand, when studying hydrogen sulphide adsorption in NOS also reported a \n\nbetter-fit model using Langmuir isotherm.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n3.3.6. The effect of adsorbent concentration on P-removal \n!\n \n\nUsing oyster-shells in excess can possibly lead to an expensive consumption \n\nof both material and energy. For that reason, in this part of the experimental setup was \n\nevaluated the optimal adsorbent concentration for P removal from saltwater. At the \n\nlight of the above experimental trials, it was made clear that COS-F0.5 provided \n\noptimal P removal percentages, by also taking into consideration pH variations in the \n\nfinal solution. The experiments were performed with an initial P concentration of 12 \n\nmg L-1, for 15 minutes. Figure 3.9 depicts the removal and capacity of P adsorption \n\nalong varying COS concentrations, as well as the measured pH changes.  \n\n  \n\na. b.  \n\nFigure 3.9. Effect of five adsorbent concentrations in phosphate removal (R) and (b) solution \n\npH; using COS F1 during 15 minutes of exposure to a [P]i of 12 mg L\n-1. \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n83 \n\nCOS concentrations of 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 5.00 g L-1 achieved in 15 \n\nminutes a P-removal of 41.5\u00b123.8%, 82\u00b122%, 86.8\u00b110.8%, ?98.1% and ?98.1%, \n\nrespectively. This suggests that more than enough adsorbent is present for P-removal \n\nand a COS concentration of 0.75 g L-1 is sufficient to acquire high P-removal. On the \n\nother hand, the maximum solution pH reached was measured at 0.75 g adsorbent L-1 \n\n(10), being lower at 0.10 g adsorbent L-1 (8.8) (Figure 3.9b).  \n\nAccording to Equation 12, for hydroxyapatite precipitation, 6 moles of PO43- \n\nrequire 10 moles of Ca2+ and a pH>10. Therefore, for complete hydroxyapatite \n\nformation, the concentration of adsorbent needs to be in excess. According to the \n\nTGA analysis (Figure 3.1), the adsorbent is composed by 99% CaO. Based on the \n\nlowest concentration used (1 g L-1), Ca2+ concentration in solution is 1.8 mmol L?1, \n\nwhich is 3 times superior to the minimum Ca2+ required (0.65 mmol L?1) for complete \n\nhydroxyapatite precipitation. However, Figure 3.9a only shows high removal for \n\nconcentrations of 0.75 and 5 g L-1. Therefore the limiting factor for hydroxyapatite \n\nprecipitation in 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 g L-1 is the pH, since all the adsorbent concentrations \n\napplied had enough Ca2+ in solution. However, XDR analysis of the shells after P-\n\nremoval did not show peaks characteristic of hydroxyapatite, suggesting that it can be \n\npresent in an amorphous phase or other calcium phosphate is being formed, as \n\ndemonstrated in the next section.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3.7. Biosorbent characterization after P removal assays  \n \n\nThe P removal experiments by oyster-shell samples (i.e., NOS and COS) in a \n\nsalinity of 24 in artificial saltwater led to the XRD profiles showed in Figure 3.10. \n\nThe XRD pattern of the NOS fraction showed the presence of calcite, quartz, halite \n\n(NaCl) and wustite (FeO).

The circles highlight the peaks of calcite (CaCO3; !), \n\nquartz (SiO2; !) and lime (FeO; !), halite (NaCl; !) \n\n \n\nThe detection of NaCl in both fractions and FeO in NOS is associated with the \n\nuse of saltwater in the experiments. Saltwater presents NaCl and Fe compounds, \n\nwhich might precipitate and crystallize during the slow drying of the samples. \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n85 \n\nHowever, no crystalline P-based compounds could be detected. Instead of this, Yu et \n\nal. (2010) suggested the precipitation of a calcium phosphate [Ca5(OH)(PO4)3] \n\nthrough the reaction of calcium silicate with phosphates in a freshwater phosphate \n\neffluent, under P-removal experiments conducted with COS (calcination at 800\u00baC for \n\n1h). In an attempt to find out the amount of P associated with the adsorbents, an ICP-\n\nMS analysis was carried out.  \n\nThe measured concentrations of P in NOS+P and COS+P fractions (Table 3.1) \n\nwere coherent with the adsorption capacity (q) of each biosorbent material (cf. Figure \n\n3.4), for the same experimental conditions. Hence, it strengthens the P biosorption \n\npotential of oyster shell wastes, particularly by COS. Besides, this analysis showed \n\nthat although P did not form crystalline precipitates as observed by Yu et al. (2010), it \n\nrests associated with the bioadsorbent. \n\n \n\n3.4. Conclusions \n \n\nThe present study has demonstrated that waste oyster-shells can be used as an \n\neffective reagent for phosphate removal in seawater. Specifically, it was shown that \n\ncalcination as a pre-treatment, effectively increases P-removal ability of oyster-shells, \n\nthough it can promote the raise of pH in saltwater. For an initial concentration of 12 \n\nmg P L-1, the removal percentages for NOS-F<0.125 and COS-F0.5 were, respectively \n\n56.3% and 98.1% after 120 minutes exposure. However, the smaller the \n\ngranulometric fraction, the higher the P-removal, independently of being NOS or \n\nCOS.  Adsorption was the main mechanism suggested for P removal by NOS, whilst \n\nfor COS, was suggested to be is a co-mechanism of precipitation may occur. NOS \n\nadsorption isotherm was consistent with Langmuir model and followed, \n\nsimultaneously, Elovich and Intraparticle Difusion kinetic models. COS followed \n\nonly chemically rate-controlled kinetic models, namely, Pseudo Second-Order and \n\nElovich models. Overall, optimal conditions for P removal from saltwater could be \n\nestablished for NOS and COS, which may allow comply with regulated P levels for \n\nthe discharge of wastewater in saltwater RAS. Moreover, both biosorbents enclose \n\nmany other valuable characteristics for their promising biotechnological application, \n\nnamely the recycling of waste material, the low production cost relatively to the \n\namounts required and the eco-friendly exploitation.  \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n86 \n\n3.5.

Salinity therefore does not \n\ninterfere with P quantification. Since no significant difference exist when dilution of a \n\nsample with AMW is made with DW, assay samples were always diluted with DW \n\nfor P quantification. \n\n Detection limit concentration of the method was calculated using the residual \n\nstandard error such as the following equation. \n\n \nwhere sy/x  is the residual standard error and b is the slope of the curve. Without \n\ndilution, detection limit concentration is 8.7 \u00d7 10-3 mg L-1. For the 1:26 dilution \n\ncalculated detection limit concentration, adsorption capacity and removal percentage \n\nwas 0.22 mg L-1, 11.8 mg g-1 and 98.1%, respectively. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n!\n!\n\n!\n!\n\n87 \n\n3.6.

Final Remarks \n_____________________________________________________________!\n\n!\n \n\nThe literature reports several constrains with the conventional methods applied \n\nin saltwater RAS for the removal of phosphate. The alternative methods until now \n\nexploited, including constructed wetlands, algal ponds and IMTAs, require large areas \n\nand/or investments. So far oyster-shells were only studied for their ability to remove \n\nphosphate and some metals. It would be very interesting to see other studies using \n\nother contaminants. But, if in the future this biosorbent does not show removal \n\ncapacity for more contaminants, its application for treatment of discharge wastewaters \n\nfrom marine RAS is still a very a good alternative, since phosphorus is strongly \n\noverlooked and can reach concentrations in DWW that can surpass admissible values \n\nof national and European regulations. But because application in such systems has not \n\nyet been made, more work is encouraged in this area.  \n\nThe ability for reutilization, allows application of oyster-shells for other \n\npurposes after bioremediation. Because saltwater is no longer a concern, the residual \n\nshells could potentially be used in ways in which they are already implemented, such \n\nas mixtures of construction materials. On the other hand, the removed phosphate can \n\nbe re-immobilized and separated from the shells and used for growing valued-added \n\nfreshwater or saltwater species. In the future more studies implicating re-use of the \n\nshells would be interesting.    \n\nTo conclude, the designs of any aquaculture effluents treatment need to be \n\ncarefully considered and further developed, optimized and validated for better \n\nintegration in the operational scheme, in order to increase stock production, bearing \n\nthe increase world food needs, while still maintaining social, economic and \n\nenvironmental sustainability. Because RAS are being more and more attractive as a \n\nmeans of aquaculture production, the development of sustainable and cost-efficient \n\nwastewater treatment methods will be an important aspect that will contribute to the \n\nwider use of these systems; and because of its high efficiency, cost-effectiveness, \n\nnon-toxicity and re-usable ability, oyster-shells can be suitable candidates for that."}]}}}
