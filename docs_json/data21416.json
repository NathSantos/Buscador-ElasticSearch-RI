For this purpose, within the corumbatai river basin 4 of the main \nrivers were chosen, along which 3 sampling points each were established. twenty-four samplings were \ncarried out during march-July and september-december 2001. diversity measures were used to evaluate \nbiotic data. A linear ANcovA model was used to test the hypothesis of a spatio-temporal variation in the \nfish assemblage, with species richness as the response variable, river order as the factor, and temperature \nand the natural logarithm of number of individuals as covariates. this analysis showed a spatio-temporal \nvariation in agreement with various concepts, e.g., the specie-area relationship and the river continuum, \nwhich have been exhaustively discussed in the literature. When compared to those of the other rivers, \ndata from the ribeir\u00e3o claro river showed a different pattern, probably due to human interference, and \nexemplifying aquatic habitat fragmentation that might have led to isolation of local fish populations.\n\nKeywords: Paran\u00e1 river basin, corumbata\u00ed river, fish assemblage, species diversity, habitat fragmentation.\n\nrEsUMO\n\nA estrutura das assembl\u00e9ias de peixes da bacia do rio corumbata\u00ed, Estado de s\u00e3o Paulo, brasil: \ncaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o e perturba\u00e7\u00f5es devido \u00e0 atividade humana\n\no rio corumbata\u00ed \u00e9 um dos principais tribut\u00e1rios da margem direita do rio Piracicaba que \u00e9 um tribut\u00e1rio \ndo rio tiet\u00ea. o rio corumbata\u00ed integra a bacia do rio Paran\u00e1 e \u00e9 regionalmente importante n\u00e3o s\u00f3 por \npossuir \u00e1guas de boa qualidade, mas tamb\u00e9m por possuir elementos raros na paisagem local. este estudo \nvisou caracterizar as assembl\u00e9ias de peixes do rio corumbata\u00ed e fornecer dados que contribuam para uma \navalia\u00e7\u00e3o da sua qualidade ambiental.

Assemblages are also controlled \nby intrinsic factors (biological attributes of each \nspecies [Angermeier, 1982; schlosser, 1987]) or, \nalternatively, by extrinsic factors, e.g., biotic and \nabiotic interactions among ecosystems (marsh-\nmatthews &amp; matthews, 2000). \n\nthis work focuses on the effects of \nextrinsic factors on emergent properties of a fish \nassemblage, with emphasis on spatio-temporal \nvariation and responses of these assemblages to \nongoing urbanization and changing land use in the \ncorumbatai river basin. \n\nMAtErIAL And MEtHOds\n\nthe ca. 1690 km2 corumbata\u00ed river basin \ncomprises about 13% of the hydrographic basin \nof the Piracicaba, Jundia\u00ed, and capivari rivers. \nthe study area is located between 47\u00b0 30\u2019 and  \n47\u00b0 50\u2019west and 22\u00b0 05\u2019 and 22\u00b0 30\u2019 south \n(Fig. 1).\n\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen classification, \nregional climate is cwa, i.e., subtropical, dry in \nwinter and rainy in summer, with annual mean \ntemperature varying from between 20 and 23.7 \u00b0c \n\nin January, and between 14.9 and 17.1 \u00b0c in July \n(AtlAs Ambiental..., 2002). Flow measurements \nof the basin\u2019s main river the (corumbata\u00ed) reflect \nthis climatic characteristic (Fig. 2).\n\nthe study area presents landscape features \nunusual in the interior of s\u00e3o Paulo, the state \nhaving brazil\u2019s highest industrialization index. in \n1996, the basins of the Piracicaba, Jundia\u00ed, and \ncapivari rivers contributed 18.8% of the gross \nwealth generated by sP state\u2019s industries. of the \ntotal pollution generated in corumbata\u00ed basin, \nabout 30% derives from industrial activity, while \nsewage represents ca. 70%. of the latter, 98% is \ncollected, of which only 5% is treated.\n\nthe water quality of the Piracicaba river basin \nis presently at a critical state, while those of the \ncorumbata\u00ed river are of good quality. so much so that, \ndespite its location on the margins of the Piracicaba \nriver, the municipality of Piracicaba - through which \nthe high water-volume river runs - obtains 100% of \nits water supply from the corumbata\u00ed system. \n\nof the municipalities in the corumbata\u00ed basin, \nthat of rio claro - with ca. 163,000 inhabitants, \nor 79.5% of the basin\u2019s entire population - is the \nmost important. it was estimated that of total water \npollution generated by the municipality, 97% was \nsanitary sewage, while the remaining 3% was \nof industrial origin, making rio claro the main \npollution source in the corumbata\u00ed system (Atlas \nAmbiental, 2002). \n\nthe ribeir\u00e3o claro river presents marked \nanthropic impacts, e.g., two dams: one - which had \nbeen used in the past for energy generation - in the \nlower stretch, and the other, in the middle stretch, \nfor water abstraction despite sewage spillage along \na roughly 3 km stretch of the river.\n\nduring the hydrological cycle of 2001, \ntwo samplings were carried out at 12 points: \none sampling in march-June, and the other in \nseptember-december. the samplings were made \nin 4 main rivers of the basin: Passa cinco, cabe\u00e7a, \ncorumbata\u00ed, and ribeir\u00e3o claro (Fig. 1 and \ntable 1). each sampling point consisted of a 150 m \nstretch and was located at a different altitude.\n\n\n\n433chArActerizAtioN ANd disturbANces iN FreshWAter Fish-AssemblAge structure\n\nBraz.

When compared with the \nother rivers, the Passa cinco was characterized \nby low depth-values, i.e., shallow, and the highest \nsuperficial velocity. because the corumbata\u00ed is \nthe main and the longest river in the basin, the \nsampling points were more distant from each other, \nwhich could explain the great variability observed \nin channel width. the ribeir\u00e3o claro river showed \nthe highest dispersion for turbidity values, low \nvalues for dissolved oxygen, and high values for \nconductivity. this pattern can be explained by the \ndifference between the low stretch (sampling units \n11 and 24), and that of the other two sampling \npoints. this passage of the municipality of rio \nclaro. the Passa cinco river showed the lowest \nconductivity values, evidencing limpid waters \n(tables 1, 3, and 4).\n\nincrease in number of species as the order \nof the river increases has been observed for other \nsystems (Angermeier &amp; schlosser, 1989; osborne \n&amp; Wiley, 1992), corroborating two main ecological \nconcepts, i.e., the species-area relationship \n(macArthur &amp; Wilson, 1967), as well as the river \ncontinuum concept (vannote et al., 1980).\n\nthe temperature has a pervasive effect on \norganisms, especially in ectotherms such as fishes, \nsince it regulates metabolic process intensities. \nAn increase in metabolism means an increase in \nthe energy needed, which determines the amount \nof food necessary for an organism to perform \nwork. by the same token, a fish assemblage is \nalso influenced by variations in the temperature, \nas shown by magnuson et al. (1979). besides \nrepresenting the emerging properties of the fish \nassemblage, the water temperature represented its \ntemporal dynamics.\n\nthe logarithm of the number of individuals \nwas the variable that best predicted the number of \nspecies. this can be viewed either as a consequence \nof sample size or the effect of so-called \u201cturnover \nnoise\u201d, where the variation in species richness \nexpected in a constant environment would depend \non immigration rates due to great mobility of \nthe fish and/or local extinction (Angermeier &amp; \nschlosser, 1989).\n\nthe model best explaining spatio-temporal \nvariation in the number of species of the corumbata\u00ed \n\nriver basin is that containing information about \nriver order, temperature, and number of individuals, \nexcluding the data for the ribeir\u00e3o claro river for \nreasons previously mentioned.\n\nriver systems have many variables that \ncontrol fish assemblages and, in the present \nwork, adjusting a simple model allowed a good \nvisualization of the multidimensional structure \naccounting for the spatio-temporal variation in \nthe fish species richness in the corumbata\u00ed river \nbasin. Without the effect of the rivers the ANcovA \nanalysis explained about 77% of the variability of \nthe number of species in the basin as a function of \nspatial variation, represented by river order; time \nand physiology, represented by water temperature; \nand sample size, represented by the natural \nlogarithm of number of individuals (table 7).\n\nthe fact that the model of spatio-temporal \nvariation previously presented did not fit the ribeir\u00e3o \nclaro river data might be due to the simplicity of \nthe model itself, which could not incorporate a \nlandscape of the complexity of that through which \nthis river runs. because this model is compatible \nwith continuum river theory, it cannot incorporate \nanthropic changes in the natural landscape. but a \nmodel must take into account the relationships of \na river with its surroundings, i.e., the landscape, \nwhich in the present case is composed of patches \nconnecting by corridors allowing contact among \nthese habitats. \n\nAs anthropogenic activity fragments natural \nhabitats, the results may have been, in the case of the \nribeir\u00e3o claro river, formation of metapopulations \nand disappearance of other populations that may \nsubsequently reappear due to immigration from \nadjacent areas.\n\nin any case, two causes might have led \nto the present situation: a) following adequate \nsewage treatment, specially by the municipality \nof rio claro, the high and medium stretches of \nthe ribeir\u00e3o claro river might be functioning as \ndispersal sources in recolonizing habitats along \nthe basin channels; and b) lack of rehabilitation \nmeasures for rivers of the basin, mainly the \nbasin of the ribeir\u00e3o claro river, might have \ndecreased in local population density within \nthe metapopulation, jeopardizing their survival. \nboth of these possibilities illustrate the manner \nin which the fragmentation process in aquatic \nhabitats can alter the species-area relationship \n\n\n\n439chArActerizAtioN ANd disturbANces iN FreshWAter Fish-AssemblAge structure\n\nBraz.

(2000). however, it must be remembered that \nprior to present sewage treatment many species \nhad already been distributed throughout the basin, \nwhich is small and presents low heterogeneity. in \naddition, micro and mesohabitat factors can affect \nthe primary structure, i.e., species abundance, as \nis the case with the ribeir\u00e3o claro river, which \npresently shows a high relative abundance and \ndiversity (tables 3 and 4). \n\nthe present results, although contributing \nto what is already known about spatio-temporal \nvariation of the fish assemblage of the basin of the \ncorumbata\u00ed river, also were useful in detecting \nbehavioral differences based on the data of the \nmost impacted river of the basin, the ribeir\u00e3o \nclaro, disturbed as it is by sewage spillovers while \ncrossing the municipality of rio claro, and by the \ndegree of ichtyofauna isolation in points above the \nsite at which water is abstracted. unfortunately, \nthe magnitude of this impact is not yet known, nor \nis it known for how long the fish assemblage can \nsurvive local environmental alterations. \n\n rEFErEncEsrEFErEncEs\n\nAgostiNho, A.
