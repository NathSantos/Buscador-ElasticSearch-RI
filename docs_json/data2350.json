The motivation was due to the frequent observation of bipolar features\n\nassociated to the Brazil Current flow south of Cape Frio (RJ) and off Santos Bight (22?\n\n- 28? S). Such observations were mainly obtained from sea surface temperature im-\n\nages, and also from few \u201din situ\u201d hydrographic and direct velocity measurements data.\n\nTherefore, our main focus is on the formation of bipolar features associated with the\n\nflow, and the main hypothesis is that barotropic instability is responsible for the gen-\n\neration of such dipoles along the western boundary current jet, while it has to deal\n\nwith topographic variations along its path poleward. We address the system dynam-\n\nics from a semi-theoretical perspective, and also through the application of numerical\n\nmodeling on a process study approach. So it includes semi-theoretical studies of jet-\n\nlateral boundary interactions in idealized configurations relevant to the Brazil Current\n\nsystem off Cape Frio, considering the quasi-geostrophic theory as an appropriate ap-\n\nproximation of the system we want to investigate. Additionally, numerical modeling\n\nis used through the construction of idealized scenarios where we simplify the physics\n\nin order to isolate the dynamical process of interest. All the dynamical analyzes were\n\ninitialized from synoptic hydrographic data set which comprised the Brazil Current\n\nsystem off Cape Frio region. We validated the quasi-geostrophic theory we assumed\n\nand obtained the kinematics characteristics of the jet. In the dynamical analyses, we\n\nstarted the investigation from the simplest framework applied here, where we evaluate\n\na piecewise constant potential vorticity field in a quasi-geostrophic contour dynamics\n\nmodel. It dealt with a meridionally-oriented jet flowing southward along a straight\n\nwestern boundary. Next, in a second model, we added more complexity in the system,\n\nv\n\n\n\nidealizing western boundary coastline scenarios considering a quasi-continuous po-\n\ntential vorticity field in a quasi-geostrophic numerical model. Finally, in a third model,\n\nwe constructed a more complex scenario for the Brazil Current jet that incorporated\n\nreal topography and stratification of the water column in a primitive equation numer-\n\nical model.\n\nAmong our main finds, we verified that purely barotropic instability is able to gen-\n\nerate vortex dipoles. Moreover, variations in the western boundary can indeed trig-\n\nger perturbations in the jet and dipoles form. Therefore, sites with abrupt change in\n\nbathymetry and coastline orientation are preferred to the formation of the BC vorti-\n\ncal dipoles. Vortex streets and instability trains can also develop downstream of such\n\nlocations as consequence of perturbing a potentially batropically unstable jet. Hence,\n\nthe horizontal shear is key to the generation of vortex dipoles. A weak shear does not\n\nallow these features to form, instead, frontal eddies are possibly generated, with the\n\npredominance of anticyclones. Although the three different model strategies applied\n\nhere differ in dynamical configurations and approximations, they still kept nearly the\n\nsame regime for the Brazil Current vortex-dipole formation. Topographic variations\n\nsuch as those associated with the change of coastline orientation near Cape Frio (23?S)\n\naccount for those vortex dipoles and streets be dominantly observed within the Santos\n\nBight.\n\nKeywords: Brazil Current, dipoles, quasi-geostrophy, barotropic instability, western\n\nboundary.\n\nvi\n\n\n\nResumo\n\nA presente tese examina a natureza das interac?o?es entre jato e contorno e o papel de\n\ninstabilidades barotro?picas no sistema Corrente do Brasil (CB) quando este ainda se\n\nencontra fluindo junto a? margem continental oeste. A motivac?a?o se deu atrave?s da\n\nfrequente observac?a?o de feic?o?es bipolares associadas ao escoamento da CB ao sul de\n\nCabo Frio (RJ) e ao largo da Bacia de Santos (entre 22? e 28? S). Tais observac?o?es se\n\ndevem principalmente a imagens termais de temperatura da superf??cie do mar, a al-\n\ngumas raras observac?o?es \u201cin situ\u201d atrave?s de dados hidrogra?ficos e medic?o?es diretas\n\nde velocidade. Assim, o principal foco e? na formac?a?o de feic?o?es bipolares associ-\n\nadas ao fluxo me?dio, sendo a principal hipo?tese a de que instabilidade barotro?pica\n\ne? responsa?vel pela formac?a?o destes dipolos ao longo da corrente quando esta tem que\n\nlidar com variac?o?es da topografia. Este estudo tenta abordar os problemas em uma\n\nperspectiva semi-teo?rica, e tambe?m atrave?s de modelagem nume?rica em uma abor-\n\ndagem de estudos de processo. Assim, inclui estudos semi-teo?ricos em configurac?o?es\n\nidealizadas relevantes para o sistema Corrente do Brasil ao largo de Cabo Frio, con-\n\nsiderando a teoria quase-geostro?fica como a aproximac?a?o apropriada para a dina?mica\n\ndo sistema que queremos avaliar. Adicionalmente, a modelagem nume?rica e? usada\n\natrave?s da construc?a?o de cena?rios idealizados onde simplificamos a f??sica a fim de\n\nisolar os processos que queremos investigar. Toda a ana?lise dina?mica partiu de um\n\nconjunto de dados que compreendeu o sistema Corrente do Brasil ao largo de Cabo\n\nFrio. Validamos a teoria quase-geostro?fica que estamos considerando e obtivemos as\n\ncaracter??sticas cinema?ticas do jato. Nas ana?lises dina?micas, comec?amos a investigac?a?o\n\ndo problema partindo do cena?rio mais simples utilizado aqui, onde consideramos um\n\ncampo de vorticidade potencial discretizado em camadas horizontais em um modelo\n\nquase-geostro?fico de dina?mica de contornos. O modelo incorporou a presenc?a de\n\nvii\n\n\n\numa linha de costa retil??nea orientada meridionalmente no contorno oeste. Posteri-\n\normente, inclu??mos mais complexidade no sistema, idealizando diferentes cena?rios de\n\nlinha de costa e considerando um campo de vorticidade potencial quase-cont??nuo em\n\num modelo nume?rico quase-geostro?fico. Finalmente, constru??mos um cena?rio ainda\n\nmais complexo para a Corrente do Brasil, o qual incorporou a topografia real da regia?o\n\ne a estratificac?a?o da coluna de a?gua em um modelo nume?rico de equac?o?es primitivas.\n\nDentre as principais concluso?es, pudemos comprovar que instabilidade barotro?pica\n\npode promover a formac?a?o de dipolos. Ale?m disso, variac?o?es no contorno podem con-\n\nsequentemente ser gatilhos para gerar perturbac?o?es no jato e dipolos se formam. As-\n\nsim, locais de mudanc?a abrupta de batimetria e orientac?a?o de linha de costa sa?o preferi-\n\ndos para a formac?a?o de dipolos vorticais. Rua de vo?rtices e trens de instabilidade\n\ntambe?m podem se desenvolver a? juzante de tais locais como conseque?ncia de se pertur-\n\nbar um jato potencialmente barotropicamente insta?vel. Consequentemente, um cisal-\n\nhamento horizontal e? chave para a gerac?a?o de dipolos vorticais. Um cisalhamento rela-\n\ntivamente fraco na?o permite a formac?a?o de tais feic?o?es, e em vez disso, vo?rtices frontais\n\nsa?o possivelmente gerados, com a predomina?ncia de anticiclones. Apesar de as tre?s\n\ndiferentes estrate?gias aplicadas aqui diferirem em termos de configurac?o?es dina?micas\n\ne aproximac?o?es, estas ainda mantiveram aproximadamente o mesmo regime para a\n\nformac?a?o de dipolos. Variac?o?es na topografia tais como aquelas associadas com mudan-\n\nc?as de orientac?a?o de costa pro?ximo a Cabo Frio (23?S) contam com o fato de dipolos\n\nvorticais e rua de vo?rtices serem frequentemente observados dentro da Bacia de Santos.\n\nPalavras-chave: Corrente do Brasil, dipolos, quase-geostrofia, instabilidade barotro?pica,\n\ncontorno oeste.\n\nviii\n\n\n\nList of Figures\n\n1.1 Representation of the large scale circulation pattern present along the Brazil-\n\nian continental margin, southwestern Atlantic, in which the western boundary\n\ncurrent system is indicated.

It was motivated by the Brazil Current system\n\nscenario, where the geostrophic current deals with topographic variations and, addi-\n\ntionally, presents an intense mesoscale activity, such as meanders, eddies and bipolar\n\nfeatures. Here, we try to address our theoretical ideas about topography-mean flow-\n\neddy interactions, idealizing scenarios in accordance to the actual system through the\n\nuse of analytical and numerical modeling, and isolating the physical process we are\n\ninterested in. The main focus is the investigation of dipoles formation.\n\n1.1 Background and Motivation\n\n1.1.1 The Brazil Current context\n\nWBCs are confined geostrophic jets that flow attached along the western continen-\n\ntal margins of the oceans. Regarding the oceanic large scale wind-driven circulation,\n\nWBCs are seen as the return of the Sverdrup transport integrated for the ocean basin\n\ninterior, inside the subtropical gyre regions. The dominance of time-dependent eddies\n\nover the mean flow implies that the characteristics of the current vary strongly in time\n\n[Cessi &amp; Ierley, 1993].\n\nIn the South Atlantic, a complex system of WBCs takes place (Figure 1.1). The upper\n\nlayer is composed by the Brazil Current (BC) jet that flows poleward along the Brazil-\n\n1\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 2\n\nFigure 1.1: Representation of the large scale circulation pattern present along the Brazilian\ncontinental margin, southwestern Atlantic, in which the western boundary current system is\nindicated. Based on Stramma &amp; England [1999].\n\nian continental margin. Bellow, the Intermediate Western Boundary Current (IWBC)\n\nand the North Brazil Undercurrent (NBUC) flow equatorward. Such system is mostly\n\ninduced by the large scale wind-driven circulation and it is resultant from the bifur-\n\ncation of the southernmost branch of the South Equatorial Current (sSEC) at several\n\nvertical levels.\n\nConsidering the above system at surface, BC originates at the sSEC bifurcation,\n\nbetween 14.5?S and 16?S, according to the near-surface large-scale climatological flow\n\npatterns [Stramma, 1991; Stramma &amp; England, 1999; Rodrigues et al., 2007]. At this area,\n\nBC is a shallow flow of about 100 m deep, transporting Tropical Water (TW), and it\n\nis characterized by a eddy-dominated flow still organizing itself as a jet, as recently\n\npointed out by Soutelino et al. [2011].\n\nAbout 20?S, BC is incremented by the flow coming from the sSEC bifurcation at\n\nintermediate depths, correspondent to the thermocline layer. In this region, the South\n\nAtlantic Central Water (SACW) is carried at a depth range of 150 m to 500 m, which\n\nmakes the BC to become deeper. Therefore, downstream of it, within the 20?-26?S lati-\n\ntude range, the BC flow is stronger and better organized along the western boundary.\n\nNevertheless, BC is associated to an intense mesoscale activity, presenting frequent me-\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 3\n\nanders and eddies that may detach from the jet [Signorini, 1978; Garfield, 1990; Silveira\n\net al., 2000; Calado, 2001; Silveira et al., 2004].\n\nAround 26?-28?S, according to Bo?ebel et al. [1999], the sSEC bifurcates in deeper lev-\n\nels (500 m to 1200 m), which corresponds to the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AIW)\n\nlayer [Stramma &amp; England, 1999]. Then, BC flow is even more robust and characterized\n\nby a poleward jet flowing between 0 m and 1200 m. The BC flows until it encounters\n\nthe Malvinas Current, around 38?S [Olson et al., 1988]. Such as its analogous Florida\n\nCurrent in the northern hemisphere, the BC presents a rich mesoscale activity, fre-\n\nquently reported in the literature [Mascarenhas et al., 1971; Signorini, 1978; Silveira et al.,\n\n2000, 2004], characterized by the formation of meanders and eddies along its track.\n\nRegarding the equatorward flow originated from the sSEC bifurcation, the IWBC\n\nis originated within the AIW vertical domain, in 26?-28?S, and flows under the BC\n\nflow. Up north, IWBC flow receives the contribution of sSEC bifurcation within SACW\n\nvertical domain, in 20?S, and becomes NBUC [Stramma &amp; England, 1999]. Up to this\n\narea, NBUC flow has a vertical extension of about 800 m and flows northward right\n\nbelow BC. North of 15?S, the bifurcation increments NBUC flow with a surface flow,\n\noriginating the North Brazil Current [Silveira et al., 1994]. Silveira et al. [2000] presented\n\na good review of the upper ocean WBC system off the Brazilian coast, characterizing\n\ntransports, velocities, water masses composition, vertical extension, occurrence of me-\n\nanders and eddies. Going downward in the water column, below the described system\n\nof WBCs, the wind-driven circulation vanishes and the thermohaline general circula-\n\ntion takes place, composing the deep ocean motion.\n\nGiven the large scale wind-driven circulation patterns present at the southwestern\n\nAtlantic, one can see that the vertical structure of the system of WBCs in the upper\n\nocean is composed basically by 2 layers of opposing flows, which suggests the ex-\n\nistence of a very baroclinic system. Some studies, such as Silveira et al. [2008], pro-\n\npose that geophysical instabilities due to the vertical shear are responsible for the\n\ngrowth of some of the recurrent mesoscale features present along the BC flow. Such\n\nintense mesoscale activity is present since its origin until the BC-Malvinas confluence\n\nregion. In between this locations (Figure 1.2), the so called southeastern Brazilian coast\n\npresents a more robust BC that very often meanders and form eddies. In general, these\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 4\n\nmeanders and eddies present a diameter of about 100 km, having the same scale of the\n\nBC horizontal extension. In this scenario, it becomes important to point out to the to-\n\npographic characteristics of the region, which is very peculiar and it is probably associ-\n\nated with the intense mesoscale activity cited above. As we can note in Figure 1.2, Cape\n\nSa?o Tome? and Cape Frio are locations where the continental margin presents consider-\n\nable variations. In that figure, the 200 m and 1000 m isobaths are indicated with gray\n\ncontours, and it is approximately the location of the continental shelf break and slope\n\nregions, respectively. North of Cape Frio, the continental shelf is narrower, the slope\n\nis very steep, and the continental margin presents a north-south orientation. South of\n\nCape Frio, its direction suddenly changes, firstly becoming dominantly west-east, and\n\nafterward presenting a northeast-southwest direction. In this region, the continental\n\nshelf is wider and the slope smoother. Such characteristics bring several consequences\n\nto the WBC system that takes place in the region. In theory, the geostrophic current\n\ntends to flow along a constant isobath, conserving potential vorticity. Variations in\n\nthe topography may cause deviations in the stretching vorticity and, consequently, in\n\nthe relative vorticity. Therefore, deviation of the mean steady state flow may occur\n\nas a tentative of the geostrophic jet in conserve potential vorticity. Silveira et al. [2000]\n\nsuggested this explanation to the BC meandering off southeast Brazil. Such mesoscale\n\nactivity will be better described and discussed in section 1.1.2. Nevertheless it is im-\n\nportant to keep in mind the topographic configuration in this region.\n\n1.1.2 The Brazil Current mesoscale activity and dipoles\n\nEvidence of finite amplitude cyclonic and anticyclonic meanders in the BC system has\n\nbeen widely reported in the literature, as mentioned by several authors, such as Sig-\n\nnorini [1978], Garfield [1990], Silveira et al. [2000], Calado et al. [2006], Silveira et al. [2008],\n\nto cite just a few (and other works cited therein). First observations and descriptions\n\nwere reported by the classical studies of Mascarenhas et al.

Figure 1.4, presented\n\nby Silveira et al. [2008], shows a sea surface temperature image exemplifying the recur-\n\nrent Cape Sa?o Tome? cyclonic meander pinching off from the BC. The authors, through\n\ncurrent-meter mooring data analyses, applied an instability model which pointed to\n\nbaroclinic instability as the mechanism responsible for the meander growth in Cape\n\nFrio-Cape Sa?o Tome? region. Mano et al. [2009] focused on the investigation of energy\n\ntransfer between the BC-IWBC system and in the formation of the Cape Frio eddies.\n\nThey found out that, due to the vertical shear, baroclinic instability drains energy from\n\nthe mean flow of the IWBC at a first moment, and the perturbation signal propagates\n\nupward, ending up in energy drain from the BC. This process allow the cyclonic eddies\n\nto grow through the energy transfer between the mean flow and the perturbations. The\n\ninteresting point in this study is the evidence that the energy transfer to the perturba-\n\ntions starts at intermediate depths, which corresponds to the IWBC layer.\n\nSouthwestward-propagating, slowly growing meanders were described by Campos\n\net al. [1995] and Campos et al. [1996] through the observation of a meandering pattern\n\ncomposed by strong cyclonic and anticyclonic frontal eddies south of Cape Frio. Cam-\n\npos et al. [2000] suggested that the change in the coastline orientation induces such me-\n\nandering. A close analogy is seen in the western North Atlantic where the Gulf Stream\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1.

INTRODUCTION 7\n\nleaves the edge of the continental shelf near Cape Hatteras and large instabilities be-\n\ngin to develop a short distance downstream [Fofonoff , 1981]. These instabilities form a\n\nsequence of cold core and warm core rings that occasionally detach from the current\n\nmain axis. Pratt et al. [1991] used a contour dynamics idealized model and could show\n\nthat the Gulf Stream warm rings, known as \u201cwarm outbreaks\u201d, are the consequence\n\nof barotropic instabilities in a propagating Rossby wave. Silveira et al. [2000] discussed\n\nthat the sequence of opposing signal meanders off Brazil consists of vortex pairs con-\n\nnected to the BC main axis, and have horizontal length scale smaller than the cyclones\n\noff Cape Frio (e.g. smaller than 100 km). Yet, they compare such phenomenon with the\n\n\u201cwarm outbreaks\u201d present in the Gulf Stream, and speculated that the phenomenon is\n\na barotropically unstable topographic Rossby wave. Figure 1.5 illustrates, through a\n\nsea-surface temperature satellite image, a sequence of cyclonic and anticyclonic mean-\n\nders along the Brazilian continental margin. This sequence of opposing signal mean-\n\nders suggests the existence of non-paired bipolar features connected to the BC flow. In\n\nFigure 1.6, it is more evident the presence of a non-paired dipole, which was described\n\nby Campos et al. [1996] off southeast Brazil (upper panel). In the lower panel, a paired\n\nbipolar feature is indicated, where two eddies of opposing signs are connected to the\n\ncurrent main axis, and it was presented by Velhote [1998]. The figure also indicates a\n\nfrontal cyclonic meander upstream. Despite not discussed by Signorini [1978], in Fig-\n\nure 1.3 a cyclonic meander is associated with the anticyclonic eddy discussed by the\n\nauthor, which characterizes a bipolar feature captured by the dataset.\n\nDescription of those dipoles along the southeast Brazilian coast and studies fo-\n\ncusing on the dynamics of this phenomenon are very limited, although they are fre-\n\nquent observed through sea-surface temperature satellite images. Here we present\n\n3 snapshots of satellite sea-surface temperature (SST) maps that seem to have cap-\n\ntured bipolar features along the southeastern Brazilian continental margin in different\n\ntimes. The SST data was obtained from the Group for High-Resolution Sea Surface Temper-\n\nature (SST) (https://www.ghrsst.org/). Over the SST images we plotted the cor-\n\nrespondent geostrophic velocities maps computed from sea-surface height, obtained\n\nfrom altimeter data. The ready-to-use gridded velocity data was extracted from the\n\nAVISO database - Archiving, Validation and Interpretation of Satellite Oceanographic data\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1.

The BC signature can be noticed by the warm waters (reddish\n\ncolors), while the continental shelf cold waters are signed by the bluish colors. Figure\n\n1.7 (right panel) shows a snapshot for April 25, 2008. In this one, it is possible to see a\n\nsequence of opposing signs meanders and eddies along the BC axis. The meandering\n\npattern in centered along the continental shelf break (represented in the figures by the\n\n200 m isobath). Figure 1.8 shows a snapshot for September 5, 2011. In this last one, we\n\ncould not obtain the correspondent geostrophic velocity data information. However, it\n\nis still possible to note the signature of a mushroom-like feature.\n\nAdditionally to the above evidences, Pereira [2009], in his master thesis, described a\n\nbipolar feature captured by a hydrographic cruise conducted between 22-29 of Septem-\n\nber, 2003. The cruise was part of the Project \u201cDina?mica do Ecossistema da Plataforma\n\nda Regia?o Oeste do Atla?ntico Sul\u201d, the DEPROAS Project. It was the last of a se-\n\nries of five synoptic cruises conducted off southeast Brazil, within the parallels 23?-\n\n26?S and meridians 45?-41?W. The dipole signature was captured both in the refer-\n\nenced geostrophic velocities and in direct-measured velocities.

INTRODUCTION 10\n\nby the author in 20 m depth (upper panel) and 100 m depth (lower panel). In both\n\nmaps, the bipolar signature is evident. Trying to go inward the dynamics of the cap-\n\ntured feature, and still using the same cruise dataset, the author applied a barotropic\n\ninstability model under the 11/2-layers approximation and could see some incipient\n\ndynamical characteristics. The first one was the evidence of the weakness of the BC\n\nflow after passing by the bipolar structure. A second characteristic pointed by the\n\nauthor was that relative vorticity and stretching vorticity compete for the system dy-\n\nnamics. This indicates that the feature under investigation belongs to typical mesoscale\n\ndynamics. Third, the streamfunction fields associated to the cyclone and to the anticy-\n\nclone act in a way to amplify the potential vorticity structures associated reciprocally\n\nto those fields. This is a general form to define an instability process and, consequently,\n\nhe concluded the dipole was under a barotropic growth process. Moreover, the cyclone\n\ninduces downstream movement on the anticyclone and vice-versa.\n\nLooking for additional evidences of the presence of the September 2003 dipole, we\n\ncalled upon again the AVISO data and plotted the geostrophic velocities for the same\n\nperiod of the DEPROAS V cruise. Figure 1.10 illustrates a snapshot of September 29,\n\n2003, which is within the period the cruise was carried out. It is general consensus\n\naltimeter data is not so reliable in continental shelf and slope regions as it is in the\n\ndeep ocean, but the velocity vectors seem to indicate the presence of two eddies of\n\nopposing vorticity right off Cape Frio. The eddies are not so intense or evident as they\n\nwere in Figure 1.9, and we can also see the BC flow is continuous south of Cape Frio.\n\nThe jet was following the 200 m isobath upstream (around 22?-24?S), and south of this\n\nlatitude the current headed straight southwestward, separating from the 200 m isobath\n\nand developing a meandering pattern of opposing signs eddies.\n\n1.1.3 Western Boundary Current dynamical studies\n\nWe revise next several idealized dynamical studies about WBC processes that inves-\n\ntigated the role of barotropic instability, topography and coastline orientation on the\n\nformation of vortex-dipoles.\n\nAccording to Rodr??guez-Marroyo &amp; Viu?dez [2009], oceanic vortex dipoles are basi-\n\ncally two closely packed regions of opposite sign vertical vorticity.

The processes responsible for the formation of\n\nsuch structures may vary. If we consider that the BC vortex dipoles are immersed\n\nin a barotropic topographic Rossby wave (such as the Gulf Stream warm outbreaks),\n\nbarotropic instability might be the mechanism responsible for the formation of such\n\nfeatures. This was pointed out by the study of Pereira [2009]. The kinematic scenario\n\nfavorable to the occurrence of barotropic instability in a jet is basically the existence of\n\nhorizontal shear. According to the linear instability theory, the necessary but not suf-\n\nficient conditions for barotropic instability is the potential vorticity gradient to change\n\nsignal at least once in the cross-jet direction. In a f plane approximation, this is known\n\nas the Rayleigh condition. For the ? plane case, it is called Kuo criterion.\n\nLeal Silva [2000] explained the evolution of dipoles in a model of converging WBCs\n\noff a western boundary. The author used a contour dynamics model in a 11/2-layers\n\nconfiguration and determined that the perturbations prescribed in the central front\n\ncreate regions of potential vorticity anomaly immersed in regions of larger or smaller\n\npotential vorticity, but of opposing signals. This scenario induced a circular motion\n\nthat produced eddies. The phase difference among the vortex structures can stimulate\n\nan amplification of those eddies, which start interacting with each other, and conse-\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 14\n\nFigure 1.11: Mechanism of formation of dipoles suggested by Bell &amp; Pratt [1992], which resulted in a\n\u201cvortex street\u201d.\n\nquently becoming bigger and transforming the initial flow in a sequence of vortex\n\ndipoles, that follow the basic flow.\n\nBell &amp; Pratt [1992], also applying a contour dynamics model, explored the interac-\n\ntion of an unstable infinite zonal jet and a singular eddy using a jet with piecewise\n\nconstant potential vorticity (in a 1-layer and 11/2-layers frameworks). They suggested\n\nthat three ingredients are responsible for the stripping of potential vorticity from the\n\nnear edges of the jet: (i) the existence of a regular eddy (a regular eddy is referred\n\nas having the velocity field it induces at the jet being opposite to the flow of the jet),\n\n(ii) the near edge of the jet must contain potential vorticity of opposing sign from the\n\neddy, and (iii) a stagnation point must exist in the flow that remains inside the jet for a\n\nsignificant percentage of an eddy turnover time. When these three conditions are met,\n\nthe eddy strips off an opposite eddy from the near jet edge and the resulting pair move\n\nupstream and away from the jet, forming what they called a \u201cvortex street\u201d. Figure\n\n1.11 shows the mechanism of dipoles formation suggested by the authors.\n\nSchmidt [2004] investigated the interaction of an unstable WBC, eddies and the con-\n\ntinental margin in idealized models of contour dynamics. Using similar scenarios to\n\nthe southeast Brazilian coast, he explored the interaction of both a rectilinear and a\n\ncurvilinear continental margin and a singular eddy that would represent the BC cy-\n\nclonic and anticyclonic meanders. The author observed the formation of bipolar fea-\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 15\n\ntures and suggested that the presence of the continental margin contributed to the\n\nformation of such dipoles. In the study of the interaction of a WBC jet with a recti-\n\nlinear meridionally oriented continental margin, a hybrid model of contour dynamics\n\nwas implemented. It consisted of allowing a barotropic configuration internally to the\n\ncontinental margin, and a 11/2-layer on the oceanic side. It was observed that unstable\n\nwaves propagated phase and group towards north with the shelf on their left. Addi-\n\ntionally, the narrower the shelf, the smaller are the propagation velocities of the un-\n\nstable waves and their corresponding growth rates. Bands of defined unstable waves,\n\nwith short and long wave limits, were obtained for all the analyzed flow configuration.\n\nThe contour dynamics experiments showed that regardless of the disturbance being\n\ncyclonic or anticyclonic, the topographic eddies formed were always anticyclonic. His\n\ninvestigation in the curvilinear coastline was limited to the barotropic 1-layer approx-\n\nimation only, where he looked to the interaction between cyclonic and anticyclonic\n\neddies with the continental margin. The bulk dynamical characteristics of the model\n\nruns, such as the formation of dipoles and topographic eddies, were not changed in\n\nthis new configuration relatively to a meridionally oriented coast.\n\nStern &amp; Whitehead [1990] looked to the problem of separation of a jet from a curvy\n\ncoast. A semi-infinite jet was considered along a vertical wall in a rotating fluid, with\n\nthe nose of the intrusion approaching a corner where the wall turns through an obtuse\n\nangle ?+180?. The jet separates at the corner and flows into the interior if ? exceeds a\n\ncritical ?c, otherwise part of the jet continues around the corner and flows along the\n\ndownstream segment of the wall. The separation criterion was computed using an in-\n\nviscid and piecewise-uniform-vorticity model. The separation effect was also demon-\n\nstrated by a laboratory experiment in which a two-dimensional jet flows along the wall\n\nfrom a source. Their calculations suggested that the separation mechanism is indepen-\n\ndent of local viscous forces, although the cumulative effect of lateral eddy stresses in\n\nthe jet is important in establishing the value of ?c immediately upstream from the cor-\n\nner. The resulting scenario for the separating jet was the formation of a dipolar vortex\n\nwhich propagated into the interior, and thereby established the path for the trailing jet.\n\nIn the non-separating jet case, the flow continued along the downstream segment of\n\nthe wall and formed a strong wall current at and downstream from the corner. This\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 16\n\nwas accompanied by a large counterclockwise offshore eddy, and no evidences of bipo-\n\nlar features were seen. In this case, all the initial conditions were the same as in the first\n\none, except that ?c was reduced by half. Hence, they argue that this separation effect is\n\nnot merely a simple consequence of the forward momentum of the jet, and actually it\n\nis strongly dependent on the angle of the change in the coastline.\n\n1.1.4 Scientific questions\n\nIn the above paragraphs we tried to summarize all the knowledge related to the BC dy-\n\nnamics south of Cape Frio and point out the missing issues. We were mostly motivated\n\nby the occurrence of bipolar features, that lack investigations regarding their dynamics\n\nin term of formation, growth and interaction with the continental margin. The recent\n\nobservational study of Pereira [2009] showed an unique observational evidence of a BC\n\ndipole captured by direct-velocity measurements and hydrographic datasets. In this\n\ncontext, some scientific questions can be pointed out:\n\n\u2022 What is the role of lateral boundary variations in the formation and growth of\n\nbipolar features frequent observed off southeast Brazil?\n\n\u2022 Is barotropic instability the mechanism responsible for the formation of these\n\nbipolar features?\n\nThe questions formulated above motivated us to develop the present research, and\n\nthe goals will be presented in the next section. Besides the gap of knowledge regard-\n\ning dipoles formation off southeast Brazilian coast, it is important to highlight some\n\nother interesting and important aspects of this location. We have mentioned the com-\n\nplexity of the topography, which presents contrasting characteristics between the north\n\nand the south of Cape Frio. Associated with that, a relatively intense coastal upwelling\n\nsystem takes place off Cape Frio and Cape Sa?o Tome?, being the most important present\n\nalong the Brazilian coast. Coastal upwelling is not common at the eastern coasts of the\n\ncontinents, as it is at the western coasts, and it is another interesting oceanographic\n\ncharacteristic of southeastern Brazil region. Although it is not the focus of our study,\n\nthe interaction of such phenomenon with BC and its eddies has been investigated. This\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 17\n\nset of attributes (WBCs system + topography + coastal upwelling) makes the southeast-\n\nern Brazilian continental margin an interesting area for oceanographic investigations,\n\nand exert some influence in the economic aspects of the region, since it is one of the\n\nmain locations of offshore oil prospection and fishery economy in Brazil. For instance,\n\noffshore platform installation and operation depends on the knowledge regarding the\n\noceanic circulation, and fishery activity might be dependent on the biomass production\n\nrelated to the rich-nutrient upwelled waters.\n\n1.2 Thesis Objectives\n\nThe rich mesoscale activity and the complex topographic characteristic off southeast\n\nBrazil motivated us to investigate the dynamics of BC dipoles and the role of topogra-\n\nphy on it. Given the lack of studies that have investigated the physical processes that\n\ndrive the formation and growth of such dipoles, and considering the questions formu-\n\nlated in the previous section, we proposed a semi-theoretical and idealized investiga-\n\ntion of the interaction of the BC flow and topography, looking to the development of\n\ngeostrophic instabilities able to form dipoles and likely features. The work discussed\n\nhere attempts to improve our theoretical understanding of the role of topography (fo-\n\ncusing on lateral boundary variations primarily) in the time-dependent dynamics of a\n\nmeridionally evolving, strongly inertial, unstable jet in a configuration and parameter\n\nregime that is relevant to the BC jet system, as well as other relatively weak WBCs\n\n(while attached to the continental margin).\n\nTherefore, the objectives are:\n\n1. to characterize an approximately non-perturbed BC jet captured by an hydro-\n\ngraphic dataset that comprised Cape Frio oceanic region. Here we aim to describe\n\nthe flow in terms of horizontal and vertical extensions, cinematic characteristics\n\nand horizontal cross-jet structure of velocity and potential vorticity;\n\n2. to obtain the linear instability properties of the BC jet, such as phase and group\n\nvelocities and growth rate of the perturbations;\n\n3. to isolate the barotropic instability effect and examine the nonlinear evolution of\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 18\n\na unstable meridional jet attached to a rectilinear western boundary;\n\n4. to examine the interaction of a barotropically unstable meridional jet and a west-\n\nern boundary in idealized configurations relevant to BC jet system, in particular\n\nthe role of lateral boundary variations;\n\n5. to examine eddy-jet-topography interactions of a meridional evolving jet inside\n\na realistic topography scenario.\n\nThe present study is based on quasigeostrophic theory, and all the dynamical pa-\n\nrameters computed and discussed here are done assuming this physical simplification,\n\nwhich is reasonable to the phenomenon scale in question. Nevertheless, through ob-\n\nservational data analyses, we will be able to validate such approximation.\n\nIn order to accomplish those goals, we consider the geophysical instability theory\n\nto obtain the linear instability properties of the BC jet. This is also the reason why we\n\naim to describe firstly an approximately non-perturbed BC jet. Goals 3, 4 and 5 are\n\nall nonlinear analyzes. Following the presented order, in each one, we aim to make\n\nuse of more complex frameworks and methodologies and, therefore, try to construct\n\na theoretical understanding of dipole formation through the isolation of physical pro-\n\ncesses. Then, item 3 makes use of the contour dynamics technique where a piecewise\n\nconstant potential vorticity field is constructed based on the BC jet characteristics and\n\nevolves nonlinearly in time. Item 4 makes use of a quasigeostrophic numerical model\n\nwhere the potential vorticity field is quasi-continuous and the effect of a curvy west-\n\nern boundary is inserted. Finally, for goal 5 we make use of a primitive equations\n\nnumerical model framework where we also include an idealized BC jet, but using a\n\nrealistic topography scenario. The methodologies briefly described above will be fully\n\npresented on their correspondent chapters.\n\nIt is the hope that the semi-theoretical approach of studying idealized models will\n\npermit more insight on the essential physics of the system, while the observational\n\nanalysis can provide the necessary reality check to help understand the relevance of\n\nthe idealized system and the theoretical framework derived from it to the real oceanic\n\nsystem. Taken together, the goal is to construct a tractable theoretical framework in\n\nwhich to think about eddy-jet-western boundary interactions in WBC jet systems, that\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 19\n\ngives both an understanding of the dynamics from first principles, as well as an under-\n\nstanding of its relevance to the actual oceanic system.\n\n1.3 Thesis Outline\n\nWork towards achieving these goals is presented in the following five chapters. Chap-\n\nter 2 presents a brief overview regarding the theory in which we based our study.\n\nMoreover, we present the BC potential vorticity structure from observational data. Yet,\n\nwe validate the theory we are applying in this study using the cited dataset. Based on\n\nthe observational evidences of the BC, in Chapter 3 we apply the technique known as\n\ncontour dynamics. Therefore, we perform a linear evaluation of the observed jet and\n\nanalyze the evolution of a idealized meridional jet in a piecewise potential vorticity\n\nfield. Advancing our analyses into the nonlinear theory, Chapter 4 presents the non-\n\nlinear, time-dependent development of a meridional unstable jet attached to a western\n\nboundary in a quasigeostrophic numerical model, where the potential vorticity field\n\nis now continuous. Finally, Chapter 5 consists in the evaluation of a BC-like jet in a\n\nprimitive equation numerical model. The modeled scenario consists of a continuously\n\nstratified ocean with nearly-real topography. A general discussion and conclusions are\n\npresented in Chapter 6.\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nQuasigeostrophic approximation of\n\nBrazil Current\n\n2.1 Theoretical background\n\nAs mentioned in Chapter 1, WBCs are defined as confined geostrophic jets, part of the\n\nlarge scale wind-driven circulation at subtropical latitudes, and correspond to the re-\n\nturn of Sverdrup transport integrated for the ocean basin. However, WBCs can not be\n\nessentially described using the geostrophic approximation, since it is very idealized.\n\nOceanic jets such as WBCs usually are characterized as robust flows that may develop\n\ndeviations or perturbations along its track, which are translated in the formation of me-\n\nanders or vortices (theses last ones may develop when the perturbation grow). Those\n\njets present low Rossby number, which means Earth rotation is highly important for\n\ntheir dynamics. Oceanic motions under this characteristic can be studied and better\n\ndescribed by quasigeostrophic (QG) theory, which in summary means to allow devia-\n\ntions of the steady geostrophic motion. Consequently, it is possible to investigate the\n\nformation of meanders, eddies and geophysical instabilities along the jet.\n\nTherefore, our study is based on QG theory, given the suitability of investigating\n\nWBCs dynamics by such approximation, and we will follow Pedlosky [1987]. It is im-\n\nportant to point out that we are trying to investigate the development of geophysical\n\ninstabilities in a geostrophic flow, and the first consideration the QG theory assumes\n\nis that perturbations start growing from a initial basic state, e.g. a mean steady state\n\n20\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. QUASIGEOSTROPHIC APPROXIMATION OF BRAZIL CURRENT 21\n\nflow. The linear theory explains the development of these perturbations while their ve-\n\nlocities are considered much smaller than the mean flow velocities. At the point these\n\nperturbations become too strong (e.g. the perturbed velocities have same order that\n\nthe basic velocities), the nonlinear theory comes to solve the missing issues. Therefore,\n\nthe geostrophic system of equations (which describes a horizontal steady state motion)\n\nare complemented by the temporal and advective derivatives, and from the combina-\n\ntion of the equations of motion considering those terms, we obtain the time-dependent\n\npotential vorticity equation:\n\nDq\n\nDt\n=\n\n(\n?\n\n?t\n+ u\n\n?\n\n?x\n+ v\n\n?\n\n?y\n\n)\nq = 0, (2.1)\n\nwhere u and v represent, respectively, the zonal and meridional geostrophic velocities.\n\nThis equation defines the main statement of the QG theory, which is conservation\n\nof potential vorticity (PV) q. For the 1-layer barotropic ocean under the short-wave\n\napproximation, q is define as\n\nq = ?2? + ?y, (2.2)\n\nand for a 11/2-layer (or equivalent-barotropic) ocean,\n\nq = ?2? ?\n?\n\nR2d\n+ ?y, (2.3)\n\nwhere ? is the geostrophic streamfunction and ? = ?f/?y is the variation of the Coriolis\n\nparameter f. Rd is the Rossby deformation radius, defined as Rd =\n?\n\n??\n?0\ngH\n\n|f0|\n, whereas\n\n?? represents the density difference between the layers, H is the mean active layer\n\nthickness and g is the gravity acceleration. In the equivalent-barotropic approximation,\n\nit represents the first baroclinic deformation radius.\n\nHere one can see the major advantage in using the QG framework. All the dynam-\n\nics is reduced to a single equation that is a function of ?, which is a scalar variable\n\nand makes the problem easier to be solved. It\u2019s important to highlight here that all this\n\nsystem of equations describes a horizontal motion. Equation 2.4 presents the relation\n\nbetween the geostrophic velocities and ?:\n\nu = ?\n??\n\n?y\n; v =\n\n??\n\n?x\n. (2.4)\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. QUASIGEOSTROPHIC APPROXIMATION OF BRAZIL CURRENT 22\n\nwhere u and v are the geostrophic velocities defined in the zonal (x) and meridional (y)\n\ndirections.\n\nIn Equations 2.2 and 2.3, ?2? is the geostrophic relative vorticity, ?/R2\nd\n\nis the stretch-\n\ning vorticity and ?y is the planetary vorticity variation. Combining the expressions 2.1\n\nand 2.4, we obtain a new equation for q as\n\nDq\n\nDt\n=\n\n(\n?\n\n?t\n?\n??\n\n?y\n\n?\n\n?x\n+\n??\n\n?x\n\n?\n\n?y\n\n)\nq = 0. (2.5)\n\nor\n\n?\n\n?t\nq + J(?,q) = 0, (2.6)\n\nwhere the Jacobean operator is defined as J(A,B) = ?A\n?x\n\n?B\n?y\n? ?A\n\n?y\n?B\n?x\n\n.\n\nIn the next section, we will present a recent hydrographic dataset which comprised\n\nthe BC system off southeast Brazil. We used this data to characterize the system under\n\ninvestigation in terms of vertical and horizontal structure, focusing the data analysis\n\nin guiding us to the development of the dynamical analyzes we proposed.\n\n2.2 Brazil Current potential vorticity structure and quasi-\n\ngeostrophic validation\n\nThe beginning of our analyzes will start from the evaluation of a hydrographic dataset\n\nwhich comprised the BC vertical and horizontal structure off Cape Frio. This dataset\n\nwas obtained from a hydrografic cruise conducted in July, 2001 and was the second\n\nof the Project \u201dDina?mica do Ecossistema da Plataforma da Regia?o Oeste do Atla?ntico\n\nSul\u201d (DEPROAS II). The cruise consisted of a transect off Cape Frio, composed by\n\n26 hydrografic station, but only 6 comprised the BC flow, e.g. the continental shelf\n\nbreak and slope regions. The data acquisition was performed through the use of CTD\n\ntop-bottom profiling. The CTD equipment (Conductivity-Temperature-Depth Profiler)\n\nmeasures temperature and salinity (T-S) along the water column. The cruise stations\n\nare illustrated in Figure 2.1.\n\nWe opted for choosing this dataset due to the presence of a BC flow apparently free\n\nof perturbation, e.g. no eddies or frontal meanders were associated with its flow. So,\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2.

The dots represent the location of the hydrographic stations of DEPROAS II\ncruise conduct in July 2001 across Cape Frio.\n\nwe are considering here that this current represents the quasi-mean state of the BC off\n\nCape Frio. This is important to our evaluation since we will prove that a quasi-mean\n\nflow is barotropically potentially unstable, so we will be able to validate the use of this\n\ndata.\n\nThe dataset provided us density field information to allow us to compute baroclinic\n\ngeostrophic velocities. Instead of following the traditional way of obtaining it through\n\nthe Dynamic Method, we applied the POMsec (Princeton University Oceanic Model in\n\nits sectional version) to obtain vertical sections of absolute baroclinic geostrophic ve-\n\nlocities. The method, according to Lima [1997] and Silveira et al. [2004], is independent\n\nof a reference level (for that reason it is called \u201dabsolute\u201d), and we followed the above\n\nauthors for our calculation. The use of baroclinic geostrophic velocities for our study\n\nis adequate, since the BC is a very baroclinic current, as discussed in Chapter 1.\n\nRegarding the goals of our study, here we are interested in the kinematics structure\n\nof the BC system. Some properties, related to the cross jet and vertical velocity struc-\n\ntures, are important information to help us in both determining the linear instability\n\nproperties of the jet, and in prescribing the initial idealized conditions for the nonlinear\n\nevaluations. Moreover, we may determine if the jet is potentially unstable to develop\n\ngeophysical instabilities, insofar as such conditions may trigger the development of\n\nmesoscale features. Therefore, we will use the baroclinic geostrophic velocity output\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. QUASIGEOSTROPHIC APPROXIMATION OF BRAZIL CURRENT 24\n\ndescribed above to develop all the following analyzes.\n\nFirstly, we shall present the vertical section of meridional velocity obtained across\n\nCape Frio, illustrated in Figure 2.2. In the figure, the reddish colors and negative values\n\nrepresent the BC flow, while the bluish colors and positive values are representative of\n\nthe IWBC. From this figure, one can see the BC occupying the first 450 m of water\n\ncolumn, flowing southwestward right above the continental slope. Underneath it, the\n\nIWBC is flowing northeastward, between 500 m and 1400 m.\n\nDistance (km)\n\nD\ne\np\nth\n\n (\nm\n\n)\n\n \n\n \n?0.\n\n8\n\n?0.7?0.6\n?0.5?0.4\n\n?0.\n3?0.2\n\n?\n0\n.2\n\n?0.1\n\n?0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0 0\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n.2\n\n0\n.3\n\n80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160\n?1800\n\n?1600\n\n?1400\n\n?1200\n\n?1000\n\n?800\n\n?600\n\n?400\n\n?200\n\n0\n\n?0.8\n\n?0.6\n\n?0.4\n\n?0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nFigure 2.2: Vertical section of baroclinic geostrophic velocity along the transect across Cape\nFrio. Hydrografic data obtained from DEPROAS II cruise.\n\nIn having the velocity field, we shall validate the application of QG theory for the\n\nobserved system we are analyzing. Therefore, we followed Pedlosky [1987] and checked\n\nthe conditions for the QG approximation. The first condition is the Rossby number\n\nto be very small, e.g. Ro = |?||f0| ? 1. Here ? is the vertical component of relative\n\nvorticity vector defined as ? =\n(\n?v\n?x\n? ?u\n\n?y\n\n)\n, and only the first right-hand side term is\n\nvalid for the present case. Our calculation gave us a mean Ro = 0.18, which cannot\n\nbe considered very small (e.g., smaller than 0.1), but leads to the information that the\n\nrelative vorticity represents only 20% of the absolute vorticity. This value is comparable\n\nto other estimates that employed QG theory for the study of other WBCs, such as\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. QUASIGEOSTROPHIC APPROXIMATION OF BRAZIL CURRENT 25\n\nthe Florida Current and the North Brazil Undercurrent [Xue &amp; Mellor, 1993; Meacham,\n\n1991; Silveira et al., 1999]. The second one would be the ? plane approximation, e.g.\n\n?? = ?L|f0| ? 1. L should be the typical length scale of the BC width and its eddies, that\n\nwe considered as having order 100 km. This gave us ?? = 0.04, which satisfies not only\n\nthe ? plane approximation, but we can securely ensure the f plane approximation is\n\nalso valid.\n\nAfter assuring the QG approximation can be applied to our study, we shall compute\n\nthe QGPV (q) profile. To do so, we shall introduce the dynamics we are going to retain\n\nin our idealized QG ocean, where we will be basing all the following analyzes. Con-\n\nsidering that the BC system presents an undercurrent below the BC flow and since we\n\nwant to test the possibility of barotropic instability in triggering the formation of vor-\n\ntices and dipoles, we opted for considering a 11/2-layer model (also known as reduced-\n\ngravity approximation). This approximation allows us to incorporate both the condi-\n\ntion for barotropic instability and the stratification effect in its minimal form. In other\n\nwords, we keep the baroclinic scales of geostrophic adjustment but isolate the BC from\n\ninteracting with the IWBC, and therefore, not allowing baroclinic instability to occur.\n\nFigure 2.3 exhibits our reduced-gravity model configuration. In the model, the rigid lid\n\napproximation is valid and the dynamically active layer corresponds to the BC layer\n\n(?1). In Figure 2.3, such layer is represented with thickness H. Yet, h = H +?, where ? is\n\nthe vertical variation of the interface between ?1 and ?2. Within each layer, the Taylor-\n\nProudman theorem is valid, e.g., the layers are homogeneous. The lower layer (?2) is\n\nconsidered infinite and at rest. Hence, the QG velocities are null (u = v = 0), while\n\nthe dynamically active layer of potential density (?1) is in motion. Thus, Equation 2.3\n\nunder the f plane approximation becomes\n\nq = ?2? ?\n?\n\nR2d\n. (2.7)\n\nSince we are dealing with a vertical section, instead of following the traditional\n\nmethod of computing q through the streamfunction ?, we opted for an alternative way\n\nand considered the Ertel PV equation for our calculations. For the 11/2-layer ocean, the\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. QUASIGEOSTROPHIC APPROXIMATION OF BRAZIL CURRENT 26\n\nFigure 2.3: Schematic representation of the density structure of the QG 11/2-layer\nmodel. H is the water column rest thickness. From: Leal Silva [2000].\n\nErtel PV equation is represented by Equation 2.8:\n\nD?\n\nDt\n= 0 (2.8)\n\nand\n\n? =\n? + f\n\nh\n, (2.9)\n\nwhere ? is the relative vorticity and h is the dynamical active layer thickness (see Figure\n\n2.3. After estimating ? and h, we shall use Equation 2.8 to obtain Ertel PV. From that,\n\nwe may subtract the basic PV, assumed not to be dynamically relevant, e.g. we are\n\ninterested in the ? perturbation. Therefore, q can be written as\n\nq = H ? ?f0, (2.10)\n\nwhere H is the mean upper layer thickness in the QG model (same as H of Figure 2.3),\n\nindeed, a proxy for the QGPV q.\n\nThe first step to obtain q is determining the mean cross-jet velocity profile inside\n\nthe active layer. Such layer was considered as the one defined by the SACW thickness,\n\nwhich comprises the pycnocline layer. Therefore, it is located below the mixed layer\n\nwhere ageostrophic processes may be relevant. The SACW layer is usually defined as\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2.

We computed the mean vertical velocity considering the 26.9 kg m?3 isopycnal\n\nmean level, which was about 500 m of depth. Figure 2.5 illustrates the SACW vertical\n\nlayer we are considering here. Figure 2.4 illustrates the BC velocity vertical section\n\nwhere we plotted the SACW upper and lower limits.\n\nThe velocity profile is illustrated in Figure 2.6 and gave us a jet width of 80 km and\n\na maximum along-stream velocity of -0.33 m s?1. Then, considering the velocity profile\n\nobtained in Figure 2.6, we calculated ?, that is represented by Figure 2.7 (left panel).\n\nFigure 2.7 (right panel) illustrates the cross-jet q profile. At a first glance, one can see\n\nthat such profile changes sign along the cross-jet direction. Considering x direction per-\n\npendicular to the jet axis and y direction parallel to the jet axis, we checked the Rayleigh\n\ncondition in this profile. Rayleigh condition says ?q/?x profile must have at least one\n\ninversion of sign inside the jet domain, and this defines the necessary but not suffi-\n\ncient conditions for barotropic instability. An additional and more robust condition\n\nfor barotropic instabilities is known as Fj\u00f8rtoft condition, that requires the (v??vc)?q/?x\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. QUASIGEOSTROPHIC APPROXIMATION OF BRAZIL CURRENT 28\n\nprofile to be positive in one portion of the domain (v? is the mean along-stream velocity\n\ncomponent and vc is the velocity value correspondent to the inflexion point of ?q/?x).\n\nFigure 2.8 illustrates both the Rayleigh and Fj\u00f8rtoft conditions computed for the q pro-\n\nfile in Figure 2.7. Looking to them, one can see that both conditions are met. Therefore,\n\nwe can conclude that the observed BC is potentially barotropically unstable, e.g. it is\n\ncharacterized as a jet able to develop barotropic instabilities. From that, we may go for-\n\nward in our analyzes, having velocity and PV structure as import parameters. It is also\n\nrelevant to point out that goal number 1 (presented in Section 1.2) was accomplished,\n\ne.g. we characterized an approximately non-perturbed BC jet captured by an hydro-\n\ngraphic dataset off Cape Frio in terms of horizontal and vertical extensions, cinematic\n\ncharacteristics and horizontal cross-jet structure of velocity and potential vorticity.\n\n70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170\n?600\n\n?500\n\n?400\n\n?300\n\n?200\n\n?100\n\n0\n\nupper limit = 25.6 kg m\n?3\n\nlower limit = 26.9 kg m\n?3\n\nSACW layer\n\nD\ne\n\np\nth\n\n (\nm\n\n)\n\nDistance (km)\n\nFigure 2.5: Schematic representation of the vertical layer comprised by the SACW in terms\nof density anomaly values.

Using a dynamical approximation\n\nin accordance with the observed jet scenario off southeast Brazilian coast, we started\n\nfrom the application of the method known as contour dynamics (CD), where a piece-\n\nwise constant PV field is evolved in a model that considers a meridional southward jet\n\nflowing along a straight western boundary wall. The idea of the present chapter is to\n\nstart from the simplest analysis, where we retain the physics we are interested in and\n\nwhere we have the control of the processes that are governing the results. Advancing\n\nto the next chapters, we go towards the application of methodologies that bring more\n\ndynamical complexity to the study. Therefore, at each degree of complexity we ad-\n\nvance into, the previous analysis certainly works as a control scenario and a baseline\n\nfor the next one.\n\n3.1 Methodology\n\nThe classical application of QG models is the use of the method known as CD, vastly\n\nused in studies that tried to investigate the dynamics of geophysical flows, including\n\nWBCs. Since geophysical flows are associated with PV fronts, the use of step function\n\nis a reasonable approximation. The technique was developed by Stern [1985] and Pratt\n\n&amp; Stern [1986], and some important applications are in Polvani et al. [1988], Polvani\n\net al. [1989], Meacham [1991], Pratt et al. [1991], and others. This method consists in\n\n31\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE CONTOUR DYNAMICS MODEL 32\n\nassuming that the PV horizontal field is discretized in layers of uniform vorticity. The\n\nfront separating each layer is called a contour, and PV is conserved along each contour.\n\nMoreover, the velocity is continuous across each front, but the PV is discontinuous.\n\nThen the CD technique consists in simply following the evolution of these contours.\n\nSince PV is conserved, these contours are material curves.\n\nThe geostrophic velocities can be written as contour integrals which are dependent\n\nupon the position of the contours, through the inversion of q [Pullin, 1992]. It is possible\n\nto see how the advection changes the modeled ocean structures through the evolution\n\nof q anomalies and the currents induced by them. The advantage in using CD is char-\n\nacterized by the principle of inversion of q, and then the problem (originally in two or\n\nthree dimensions) is reduced to a set of linked unidimensional problems.\n\nSilveira et al. [1999] utilized a configuration of q with only one PV front (one con-\n\ntour) in a equivalent-barotropic ocean in order to study converging jets along a west-\n\nern boundary. Silveira &amp; Flierl [2002] investigated the same problem in a 21/2-layers\n\nconfiguration, and considering a three-front jet. Following both studies, here we im-\n\nplemented the technique for a 3-front meridional jet flowing along a western bound-\n\nary in a 11/2-layers ocean. The initial conditions of the CD model were constructed\n\nbased on the jet structure and kinematics characteristics obtained in Chapter 2. The\n\nCD technique is composed by two parts. The first consists of a linear analysis, where\n\nthe linear theory considers the magnitude of the flow perturbations much smaller than\n\nthe magnitude of the mean flow velocities. This allow us to obtain the linear instabil-\n\nity properties of the jet. The nonlinear analysis allow these perturbations to grow and\n\ngive us the time evolution of the piecewise constant PV field. In the next section, we\n\npresent the development of the CD methodology for the case of a n-fronts meridional\n\njet flowing along a meridionally-oriented western boundary.\n\n3.1.1 The linear model\n\nHere we will present the equations considering a meridional jet attached to the western\n\nboundary. Since the BC flows in the southwest direction, we will consider y as the di-\n\nrection parallel to the jet and x as the direction normal to the jet. Within the jet domain,\n\nwe assumed conservation of q, in accordance with 11/2-layers QG theory. Therefore,\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE CONTOUR DYNAMICS MODEL 33\n\nwe shall recall Equation 2.6 and the q inversion relationship given by Equation 2.3.\n\nThe CD technique, besides using the q inversibility relation, requires the utilization of\n\nthe equations in their non-dimensional form. Therefore, we may scale some impor-\n\ntant parameters that will be used in the linear model. The scales utilized in this study\n\nare presented in Table 3.1. Therefore, Equation 2.3 in its non-dimensional form and\n\nassuming f plane is\n\n(?2 ? 1)? = q. (3.1)\n\nIt is important to point out that, since we are dealing typically with mesoscale struc-\n\ntures, we utilized Rd as the characteristic horizontal length scale. As we presented in\n\nSection 2.2, it was previously computed as having 36 km.\n\nTable 3.1: Non-dimensional scales.\n\nQUANTITY SCALE\nhorizontal length Rd\nhorizontal velocity V\ntime RdV\n\n?1\n\npotential vorticity V R?1d\nhorizontal PV gradient V R?2d\nV = jet core velocity\n\nThe linear model here consists in a set of calculations we utilized to determine the\n\ngradient of PV and the zonal profile of the meridional velocity, which are function of\n\nthe choices of mean velocity values at the contours. Here we also developed the set of\n\nequations that have considered the western boundary close to the flowing jet, which\n\nmeans the continent has influence on the dynamics of the fronts (contours). Following\n\nSilveira et al. [1999], the q fields can be expressed as\n\nq(x) = q0 +\n3?\ni=1\n\n?iH[x? x?i ? ?i(y,t)] . (3.2)\n\nIn Equation 3.2, the contours are enumerated in sequence with index in the range\n\n1 to 3. The ?i values correspond to the q jumps (e.g. the gradients), x?i are the con-\n\ntours mean positions, and ?i their deviations. H represents the Heaviside step function,\n\nwhere\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE CONTOUR DYNAMICS MODEL 34\n\nH(x) = 0 for x &lt;0\n\nH(x) = 1 for x > 0 .\n\nIt is possible to replace the choices of ?i by choices of v?i, e.g., the basic meridional\n\nvelocity values at the contours. Then, through the initial choice of x?i and v?i, the linear\n\ninstability properties can be obtained. The reader should note that we opted to use\n\na PV structure of four regions of piecewise constant q separated by three fronts. This\n\nchoice was made in order to correctly approximate the PV structure on the cyclonic\n\nand anticyclonic borders of the WBC jet. Moreover, the application of the technique is\n\nreasonable and it is relatively easier to solve the integrations for a three-fronts jet. As\n\nyou increase the number of fronts, the problem becomes much more complex because\n\nyou introduce a higher number of degrees of freedom.\n\nThe inversion relationship that solves the problem is Equation 3.1. Splitting such\n\nsolution in two parts, we can have one part related to the basic state ?? (the undis-\n\nturbed and straight front), and the other related to the perturbed state ?? (this last one\n\nis associated to small amplitude waves). Therefore, we obtain\n\n? = ??(x,y) + ??(x,y,t). (3.3)\n\nConsidering a wave solution type for ??, we can write\n\n?? = ?(x)eil(y?ct), (3.4)\n\nwhere c is the phase velocity and l is the wavenumber parallel to the jet. Therefore, the\n\nsolutions for ? and u? are also a wave solution type\n\n?i = ??ie\nil(y?ct) (3.5)\n\nand\n\nu? = u?eil(y?ct). (3.6)\n\nSimilarly to Equation 3.3, we shall split q as\n\nq = q?(x) + q?(x,y,t). (3.7)\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE CONTOUR DYNAMICS MODEL 35\n\nwhere\n\nq? = q0 +\n3?\ni=1\n\n?iH(x? x?i) (3.8)\n\nand\n\nq? =\n3?\ni=1\n\n?i [H(x? x?i ? ?i(y,t)) ?H(x? x?i)] . (3.9)\n\nGiven the solutions above, we can write the inversion relationship for both solu-\n\ntions q? and q?, where (\n?2\n\n?x2\n? 1\n)\n?? = q? (3.10)\n\nand\n\n(?2 ? 1)?? = q?. (3.11)\n\nApplying the equation that relates ?, u and v (Equation 2.4) in Equations 3.10 and\n\n3.11, linearizing and assuming small amplitude waves, we obtained for the basic state\n\n(\n?2\n\n?x2\n? 1\n)\nv?(x) = ?\n\n3?\ni=1\n\n?i? (x? x?i) (3.12)\n\nand for the perturbed state\n\n(?2 ? 1)u? = ?\n3?\ni=1\n\n?i? (x? x?i ? ?i)\n(\n??i\n?y\n\n)\n. (3.13)\n\nCombining the conservation of q equation (Equation 3.1) and the linear wave solu-\n\ntion type Equation 3.6, we obtain\n\nu? =\n??i\n?t\n\n+ v\n??i\n?y\n\n. (3.14)\n\nReplacing ?i and u? in Equations 3.13 and 3.14 for the wave solutions and linearizing\n\nthe equations, we obtain, respectively,\n\n(?2 ? 1)u? = ?il\n3?\ni=1\n\n[\n?i?(x? x?i)\n\n???i\n?y\n\n]\n(3.15)\n\nand\n\nu? = il ??i [v?(x) ? c]. (3.16)\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE CONTOUR DYNAMICS MODEL 36\n\nThe solutions for 3.12 and 3.15 are obtained from the Green\u2019s function method, that\n\nsatisfies\n\n?2\n\n?x2\n+ (l2 + 1) G(x|x?) = ?(x?x?). (3.17)\n\nThe solution for Equation 3.17 in the presence of a western boundary placed at x =\n\n0 is\n\nGl(x|x?) = Gl+(x|x?) + Gl?(x|x?), (3.18)\n\nwhere\n\nGl+ =\n1\n\n2\n?\nl2 + 1\n\ne?\n?\nl2+1 |x?x?|, (3.19)\n\nand\n\nGl? = ?\n1\n\n2\n?\nl2 + 1\n\ne?\n?\nl2+1 |x+x?|. (3.20)\n\nThe Gl? is associated with the vortex images necessary to satisfy the boundary condi-\n\ntion at x = 0. For the particular case of l = 0, the Green\u2019s function becomes\n\nG0(x|x?) = G0+(x|x?) + G0?(x|x?)\n\n=\n1\n\n2\ne?|x?x\n\n?| ?\n1\n\n2\ne?|x+x\n\n?|. (3.21)\n\nApplying 3.18 and 3.21 in v? and u? equations, we obtain\n\nv? =\n3?\ni=1\n\n?iG0(x|x?) (3.22)\n\nand\n\nu? = ?il\n3?\ni=1\n\n?i Gl(x|x?) ??i. (3.23)\n\nHaving Equations 3.16, 3.22 and 3.23, we can find the dispersion relation through\n\nthe applications of 3.16 in each contour and\n\nMl ??i = 0. (3.24)\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE CONTOUR DYNAMICS MODEL 37\n\nMl is the squared matrix 3 \u00d7 3 given by the three equations mentioned above. The\n\nnon-trivial solution for c is found considering\n\ndet(Ml) = 0. (3.25)\n\nFrom the dispersion relation equation, we obtain a complex number c, in which the\n\nreal and imaginary parts are related, respectively, with the phase velocity (c) and with\n\nthe wave growth rate (?). The non-trivial solutions for c is obtained as\n\nc = cr + ici = cr +\ni?\n\nl\n. (3.26)\n\nWe can also obtain the wave frequency (?) and its group velocity (cg), expressed by\n\n? = lc (3.27)\n\nand\n\ncg =\nd?\n\ndl\n. (3.28)\n\nHaving Equation 3.22, we can obtain the zonal profile of the meridional jet . In\n\npractical terms, such equation is solved in a inverted form, since the choice of v?(x?i) is\n\nmore intuitive than the q jumps choice in each front (?i).\n\nThe set of equations presented above characterizes the linear analysis, and we have\n\nshown how to obtain the linear instability properties, which are the zonal profile of the\n\nmeridional jet, growth rate of the unstable waves and phase and group velocities.\n\n3.1.2 The nonlinear model\n\nThe nonlinear model is the second part of the CD technique. It determines the non-\n\nlinear evolution of the system from a initial PV distribution. The conservation of q\n\nequation is Equation 3.1. Then, we again split the q and ? fields in two parts, such as\n\nEquation 3.3:\n\n? = ??(x,y) + ??(x,y,t). (3.29)\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE CONTOUR DYNAMICS MODEL 38\n\nwhere ?? is associated to the rectilinear q fronts positions. The inversibility relation that\n\nassociates q? and ?? is according to Equations 3.8 and 3.10:\n\n(?2 ? 1)?? = q? (3.30)\n\n= q0 +\n3?\ni=1\n\n?iH(x? x?i). (3.31)\n\nThe ?? component is the perturbed part of the solution, and it is correspondent to\n\nthe streamfunction field associated to space-temporal deviations of ?. Therefore, as\n\ndefined in Equation 3.9 and 3.11,\n\n(?2 ? 1)?? = q?\n\n=\n3?\ni=1\n\n?i [H(x? x?i ? ?i) ? H(x? x?i)] . (3.32)\n\nAccording to Pratt &amp; Stern [1986], in order to set appropriate boundary conditions,\n\nthe Green\u2019s function takes the form\n\nG = G+ + G? = ?\n1\n\n2?\nK0(r+) +\n\n1\n\n2?\nK0(r?) , (3.33)\n\nwhere K0 is the modified Bessel function of the second kind of order zero, G? repre-\n\nsents the image point required to satisfy ?? = 0 at the western boundary and\n\nr+\n2 = (x?x?)2 + (y ?y?)2 ,\n\nr?\n2 = (x + x?)2 + (y ?y?)2 .\n\nThe disturbed velocity field is determined from Equation 3.32, according to stream\n\nfunction definition\n\n(u?,v?) = (?\n?\n\n?y\n,\n?\n\n?x\n)?? , (3.34)\n\nand using Equation 3.33.\n\nThe contour dynamics technique requires Equation 3.34 be written in terms of con-\n\ntour integrals. According to Pratt &amp; Stern [1986], we need to express the x and y deriva-\n\ntives in terms of x? and y?. We then follow Silveira &amp; Flierl [2002] derivation in using the\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE CONTOUR DYNAMICS MODEL 39\n\nsymmetry properties of the Green\u2019s function to write\n\n?\n\n?x\nG+ = ?\n\n?\n\n?x?\nG+ (3.35)\n\n?\n\n?x\nG? =\n\n?\n\n?x?\nG? (3.36)\n\n?\n\n?y\nG+ = ?\n\n?\n\n?y?\nG+ (3.37)\n\n?\n\n?y\nG? = ?\n\n?\n\n?y?\nG? . (3.38)\n\nWe then invoke the divergence theorem,\n\nv? = 2\n\n? ?\nD\n\n?\u00b7 (G+~i? ?G?~i?) dx? dy?\n\n= 2\n\n?\n?D\n\n(G+ ?G?)(~i? \u00b7~n?) dr?\n\n= ?2\n?\n?D\n\n(G+ ?G?) dy? ,\n\nwhere ?D is the contour enclosing D, ~n? is the unit vector normal to ?D, dl? is the\n\ninfinitesimal increment along ?D, and~i? is the unit vector in the x?-direction.\n\nAn analogous procedure can be applied to obtain the disturbed cross-shore velocity\n\nu? in terms of contour integrals. Using the Green\u2019s function definitions (3.33) in the\n\nvelocity expressions yields\n\nu? =\n1\n\n?\n\n?\n?D\n\n[K0(r+) ?K0(r?)] dx? (3.39)\n\nv? =\n1\n\n?\n\n?\n?D\n\n[K0(r+) + K0(r?)] dy\n? . (3.40)\n\nThe partitioning of the streamfunction field was chosen so that Equations 3.32, 3.39\n\nand 3.40 do not involve improper integrals, which potentially behave poorly [Pratt &amp;\n\nStern, 1986]. Rather, ?D in Equations 3.39 and 3.40 has finite boundaries.\n\nHowever, Equations 3.39 and 3.40 still have a logarithmic singularity because K0(r) '\n\n? ln(r) when r is very small. The singularity is circumvented following Polvani et al.\n\n[1988] through a simple integration by parts of Equations 3.39 and 3.40, leading to the\n\nnon-singular expressions\n\nu? =\n1\n\n?\n[\n\n?\n?D\n\n(x?x?) K1(r+)\ndr+\n\n2\n\n2r+\n+\n\n?\n?D\n\n(x + x?) K1(r?)\ndr?\n\n2\n\n2r?\n] (3.41)\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE CONTOUR DYNAMICS MODEL 40\n\nv? =\n1\n\n?\n[\n\n?\n?D\n\n(y ?y?) K1(r+)\ndr+\n\n2\n\n2r+\n+\n\n?\n?D\n\n(y ?y?) K1(r?)\ndr?\n\n2\n\n2r?\n] , (3.42)\n\nwhere K1 is the modified Bessel function of the second kind of order one.\n\nFinally, having the q contour values, they can evolve in time according to\n\nd\n\ndt\n?i = ui =\n\nd\n\ndt\n?(xi,y + ?i(y,t), t). (3.43)\n\nIt is important to notice that the above equations are nonlinear. However, since\n\nthe second term in the Taylor series expansion of H is the delta function, the above\n\nsystem can be easily linearized. It is important to highlight that the separation of ? in\n\ncomponents, according to Silveira et al. [1999], is done to facilitate the application of the\n\nCD technique in semi-infinite domains.\n\n3.2 Linear analysis results\n\nRecalling the cross-jet velocity profile of Figure 2.6, we computed a BC width of ap-\n\nproximately 80 km. In that figure, one can notice the BC jet is almost symmetric, with\n\nits core located at about 50 km from the shelf break. The coastal side of the jet is at\n\nabout 90 km distance from the nearest point in the coast and the offshore side at about\n\n160 km. Getting the maximum velocity value in this profile and considering Rd as the\n\nhorizontal length scale, we scaled the parameters of the model according to Table 3.1,\n\nusing Rd = 36 km and |vmax| = V = 0.33 m s?1. Figure 3.1 presents again the original\n\nvelocity profile with the indication of the three contours positions used for the linear\n\nmodel. Still in the figure, the non-dimensional velocity profile is illustrated, also with\n\nthe indication of the three contours positions. The non-dimensional values used as in-\n\nput parameters for the linear model are presented in Table 3.2, where i refers to each\n\nfront (i = 1 is the continental-side front, i = 2 is the jet core front, and i = 3, the deep\n\nocean side front). x?i are the front positions, vi are the velocities at each front, and ?i\n\nare the PV jumps.\n\nHaving that, we applied the linear model. The modeled jet profile is illustrated\n\nin Figure 3.2 (left panel), where we also plotted the original observed one for com-\n\nparison. The model also gave us the q jumps (?i), also presented in Table 3.2. It is\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3.

Figure 3.2 (right panel) illustrates the\n\nnon-dimensional q profiles, the modeled over the observed one (presented in Chapter\n\n2).\n\nThe linear instability properties of the modeled jet are represented by Figure 3.3.\n\nThe upper panel illustrates the phase and group velocities of the unstable wave, while\n\nthe lower panel refers to the growth rate of the unstable wave. The higher value of\n\ngrowth rate (0,14) corresponds to a wavenumber of 1.29, which gives a wavelength\n\nof 4.87 Rd. If we re-scaled this value by Rd, we obtain a dimensional wavelength of\n\n175 km. This value in within the range of the BC paired eddies depicted in Figure 1.9.\n\nThe wavelength of 175 km is correspondent to the most unstable wave obtained by the\n\nlinear model, and might indicate that the BC is potentially unstable for the generations\n\nof a unstable wave of the same order of the previously observed mesoscale features.\n\nThe phase velocity plot confirm the propagation of the unstable wave southward, since\n\nit presents negative values only. The mean phase velocity was of -0.18, while the mean\n\ngroup velocity was of -0.31.\n\n3.3 Nonlinear results and discussion\n\nHere we present the experiment conducted for the nonlinear model. The initial condi-\n\ntions of this model were obtained from the linear model, where we used the informa-\n\ntions of front positions x?i and the PV jumps ?i (see Table 3.2). We considered that the\n\ncyclonic eddy off Cape Frio, which is a recurrent feature present in the area, can trigger\n\nbarotropically unstable waves inside the southeast Brazilian oceanic region. Hence, we\n\nassumed the meander can make the jet unstable and, because of that, we used appro-\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3.

The wavelength of the observed dipole (Figure 1.9) is indicated in the figure.\n\npriate values to excite the jet within possible wavenumbers from Cape Frio eddy. In\n\nthe absence of mechanisms to generate a Cape Frio-like eddy in the model, we used a\n\ninitial perturbation in the jet in the form of a cos bump. The perturbation equation is\n\npresented in Equation 3.44\n\nb = = Aexp\n\n[\n?(y)2\n\nw2\n\n]\ncos(k0y). (3.44)\n\nwhere we used as the wave amplitude A = 1, the function width w = 1.5 and the\n\nmost unstable wavenumber (from the linear model) k0 = 1.29 (all the values are non-\n\ndimensional). This multilobed anomaly sets k0 as the dominant wavenumber, and the\n\nwidth w determines the extent to which wavelengths neighboring k0 are present.\n\nThe results of the temporal evolution of the initial disturbance are illustrated in Fig-\n\nure 3.4. The jet is meridionally oriented and it is propagating southward. The upper\n\nleft panel illustrates the initial state of the model, where there is a bump perturbation\n\nupstream. The central front (at x = 1.55) represents the jet core. We can see the down-\n\nstream evolution of the fronts the in following days. In day 10, an eddy was formed at\n\neach side of the jet. In day 15, a dipole start to grow upstream, while eddies continue to\n\nbe formed right downstream. At the end of the simulation (day 25), the jet evolved to a\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE CONTOUR DYNAMICS MODEL 44\n\nscenario where paired eddies were generated upstream, close to the perturbation loca-\n\ntion. This result correspond to the results obtained by Pereira [2009] and Velhote [1998],\n\nwhere the dipole (paired eddies) were observed close to Cape Frio. Downstream, the\n\npattern is like a vortex street (Bell &amp; Pratt [1992]), such as the scenario described by\n\nCampos et al. [1996] in the southeast region of the Brazilian continental margin.\n\nIt is possible to note that the presence of the western wall limits the spatial growth\n\nof the features in the coastal side. We performed a simulation with the same jet charac-\n\nteristics, but in a open ocean domain (no boundaries), and could see the differences. In\n\nthe open domain, the same structures were formed, but they could spatially grow and\n\nbecame more organized. In the case presented here, the features seem to shrink due to\n\nthe solid wall, and the eddies are more distorted.\n\nThe wave typical length scale in our simulation was about 4.5 Rd, which gives a\n\ndimensional value of 162 km. The most unstable wave obtained in the linear model\n\nresults were of 175 km (4.8 Rd). Therefore, the nonlinear evolution could reproduce a\n\npattern in accordance with the linear characteristics of the jet.\n\nThe results presented here conducted us to verify that a barotropically unstable jet\n\nwithin a simple and limited framework of piecewise constant PV fronts can generate\n\ndipoles and also a sequence of non-paired eddies that propagate downstream. In other\n\nwords, a model with a PV structure that is able to support the vortex dipole forma-\n\ntion in its minimal form satisfactorily reproduced the main characteristics of the BC\n\ndipoles described in the literature from observations. In the next chapter, we will relax\n\nthe oversimplified piecewise constant PV field and allow the q structure to be quasi-\n\ncontinuous horizontally. Also, we will seek to examine the dynamical effect of a curvy\n\ncoastline besides the investigation of WBC jets flowing adjacent to a meridional coast.\n\nIn order to do that, we will calibrate the model with the jet characteristics obtained in\n\nChapter 2 and we will consider that wavelength of approximately 175 km can occur\n\n(e.g. eddies of about 87 km), which is the wavelength of the most unstable barotropic\n\nwaves that the BC jet can excite.\n\nFinally, it is important to highlight that our goals number 2 and 3 presented in Sec-\n\ntion 1.2 were accomplished in the present chapter, e.g we obtained the linear instability\n\nproperties of the observed jet, isolated the effect of barotropic instability and examined\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3.

Four PV regions are\nseparated by three fronts. The cyan color represents the coastal side of the model, while the\npurple color represents the deep ocean side of the model. The central front represents the jet\ncore.\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe quasigeostrophic numerical model\n\nIn order to bring more complexity and reality to our idealized physical system, here\n\nwe will present the methodology developed and the analysis conducted for a multi-\n\nfront (quasi-continuous) PV field. Given the fact that being more realistic regarding\n\nthe horizontal structure of the idealized ocean, the CD technique would become very\n\ncomplex to solve. The other approach presented here is essentially a numerical model\n\nunder the quasigeostrophic (QG) approximation. It allows, besides a quasi-continuous\n\nPV field, the implementation of solid boundaries, both rectilinear and curvilinear.\n\nWe intended to investigate the downstream evolution of an idealized prescribed\n\njet which was set to be potentially barotropically unstable, in order to see the possible\n\ndevelopment of instabilities translated in eddies and/or dipoles. Since our statement\n\n(presented in Chapter 1) is that bipolar features are formed due to barotropic instabil-\n\nities, here we aimed to isolate this phenomenon in a 2-dimensional QG model. Using\n\nthe information obtained in Chapter 2, this jet was calibrated with the BC characteris-\n\ntics in terms of horizontal scale and velocity magnitude.\n\nWe investigated the behavior of a meridional southward jet under the barotropic\n\nand equivalent-barotropic approximations. Trying to start from the simplest scenario\n\nand evolve to a more complex one, we considered 3 different cases. The first consisted\n\nof a meridional jet centered in a open domain. The second consisted of meridional jet\n\nflowing along a straight western boundary inside a meridional channel. In the third\n\none, we added a variant coastline, and we investigated the behavior of the jet inter-\n\nacting with this perturbation, again inside a meridional channel. The idea was to con-\n\n47\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 48\n\nstruct a theoretical understanding regarding the development of barotropic instabili-\n\nties in a BC-like jet through the investigation of the two simplest QG dynamical cases:\n\nthe 1-layer barotropic case and the 11/2-layer equivalent-barotropic case. Although the\n\nlatter consists of a dynamical simplification more in accordance with the BC system off\n\nCape Frio, the barotropic study will be the baseline in which we know the interaction\n\nof a meridional simple jet with a more complex western boundary. Moreover, although\n\nthe dipoles formation is located in a region where the CB is very baroclinic, there are\n\nevidences of the downstream propagation of these structures (resembling a wave pat-\n\ntern composed by cyclones and anticyclones) into a region where the BC tends to be\n\nmore barotropic, since the current vertical extension reaches deeper levels as it flows\n\nsouthwestward.\n\n4.1 Methodology\n\nThe model is essentially the quasigeostrophic one described in Jayne et al. [1996] and\n\nWaterman &amp; Jayne [2011]. However, while the authors investigated a zonal eastward jet\n\nalong an infinite zonal channel, here we considered a meridional southward jet. Then,\n\nour analysis is based on the along-stream evolution of an idealized WBC jet using a nu-\n\nmerical model of an unstable, boundary forced jet in a meridionally-oriented channel.\n\nThe QG model is on the f plane, and fully nonlinear, with x (zonal direction), y (merid-\n\nional direction) and time dependence, and it is dimensional. The model is forced at the\n\nnorthern boundary by imposing a jet inflow directed southward and it is scaled appro-\n\npriate to the BC extension. We solve a modified conservation of PV equation, where,\n\ninstead of considering the balance in Equation 2.6, we opted to include a dissipation\n\nterm. This was done in order to facilitate dealing with some numerical issues, such as\n\ngiving stability to the model and to configure an inflow-outflow condition. Hence, our\n\nnew PV equation (for a inviscid ocean) is\n\n?\n\n?t\nq + J(?,q) = ?R?2?, (4.1)\n\nwhere R is the bottom friction coefficient (which scales as t?1) and ?2 is the horizon-\n\ntal Laplacian operator. Again, q is our QG potential vorticity (QGPV) and ? is the\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 49\n\nstreamfunction. Then, q is defined in the 1-layer (2-dimensional) case as\n\nq = ?2?, (4.2)\n\nand for the 11/2-layer case (for the dynamical active upper layer)\n\nq = ?2? ?\n?\n\nR2d\n. (4.3)\n\nwhere Rd is the first baroclinic deformation radius.\n\nTherefore, Equation 4.1 is applied in a 2-dimensional channel with size L x W, where\n\nW = L/2, and has a uniform grid spacing of dx = dy = 15 km. We have tested a few\n\nvalues for L, since according to Berloff &amp; McWilliams [1999], the channel length and\n\nwidth may influence the dynamics of the interior because they are a parameter of the\n\nmodel. So we tried to investigate the proper size willing to chose a length big enough to\n\navoid such influence. Based on that, and following Jayne et al. [1996], we used L = 6000\n\nkm. Additionally, we chose 15 km of resolution since we are expecting wavelengths\n\nof order 175 km (according to the previous chapter), which would allow eddies of\n\nabout 87 km of diameter. Therefore, 15 km seems to be an appropriate value to allow\n\nthe occurrence of those eddies. In other words, such grid spacing is nearly \u201deddy-\n\nresolving\u201d for the eddy dimensions we are expecting to obtain.\n\nIntegration in space is done using a scheme that is center differenced in the two spa-\n\ntial dimensions (an \u201dArakawa C-grid\u201d) with flux-limited advection. The integration in\n\ntime is done using a second-order Adams-Bashforth scheme. The model is forced by\n\ninflow-outflow conditions. The inflowing jet is potentially barotropically unstable, i.e.\n\nit satisfies the Rayleigh necessary condition for instability, requiring the potential vor-\n\nticity gradient profile to change sign in the horizontal. The inflowing mass must be\n\nremoved from the domain at the southern boundary, and it is important to the rele-\n\nvance of this study to the along-stream development of a WBC jet that the northern\n\nboundary condition does not control the upstream dynamics we study. We make the\n\nupstream dynamics qualitatively insensitive to the outflow condition by making the\n\nmeridional extent of the domain long relative to the meridional extent we examine and\n\nthrough a meridionally broad northern boundary sponge layer, which allows the jet to\n\nadjust to the outflow condition near the northern boundary. The bottom friction coeffi-\n\ncient varies linearly within the channel, and it was chosen to make the inflow-outflow\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 50\n\nregions stable (steady-state condition), and to make the interior flow to be marginally\n\nstable (allowing only weak instabilities). Then R ? (900 days)?1 within the sponge lay-\n\ners and R ? (1 day)?1 in the interior (such as in Jayne et al. [1996]). No normal flow\n\nis allowed at the eastern and western walls and, following again Berloff &amp; McWilliams\n\n[1999], no-slip boundary condition is applied at the western one. According to the au-\n\nthors, the no-slip boundary condition is adequate to allow jet instabilities, and it is not\n\nthe case of the free-slip one, which has a stabilizing effect on the flow in a nonlinear\n\nregime. Verron et al. [1991] also used no-slip boundary condition in the investigation of\n\na flow past a cape in a QG framework, and mentioned that in the free-slip, no eddy-\n\nshedding is observed (see Berloff &amp; McWilliams [1999] for a discussion). In the scenario\n\nwe have a variant (curvy) western boundary, the same boundary conditions apply, and\n\nthe coastline is handled with a capacitance matrix approach.\n\nTherefore, we allow the jet to evolve freely in the meridional direction from the\n\nnorthern edge of the domain, and remove it at the southern edge a long way down-\n\nstream and in a manner that does not affect the upstream (interior) dynamics we study.\n\nNote that, although we do not run the model for a long integration time, the presence\n\nof the sponge layer on the northern boundary in particular has the effect of eliminat-\n\ning any feedback of possible recirculation strength on the inflowing jet, and as such\n\neliminates the potential for more complex behavior associated with the low-frequency\n\nvariability or multiple dynamical regimes observed in WBC systems, a complicating\n\nfeature we wished to eliminate from the system we studied.\n\nThe jet is a function of a sech2 (e.g. a Bickley jet), where the steady-state meridional\n\nvelocity is defined as\n\nv(x) = vosech\n2\n\n(\nx?xc\n?\n\n)\n, (4.4)\n\nwhere, vo is a constant that determines the velocity magnitude, ? is a normalization\n\nfactor (function decay) proportional to the jet width and xc is the position of the core\n\nvelocity. The Bickley jet was chosen based on studies that have investigated the sta-\n\nbility problem of geophysical flows using this type of function. For instance, Lipps\n\n[1963] investigated the effect of the horizontal mass divergence upon the stability of a\n\nbarotropic flow under the equivalent-barotropic approximation using a zonal jet pre-\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 51\n\nscribed as\n\nU(y) = V sech2\n(y\nL\n\n)\n+ V0, (4.5)\n\nwhere V ,L and V0 are constants. He derived the stability problem of this jet, obtained a\n\nsufficient condition for stability, and applied the stability theory to a Gulf Stream-like\n\njet, where he could compute the most unstable wavelength. Other references that had\n\napplied a Bickley jet are Mallier &amp; Davis [1999], Jayne &amp; Hogg [1999], Cunningham [2000]\n\nand Bouchut et al. [2011].\n\nAll the results presented here consider we are in the Southern Hemisphere, e.g.\n\nf &lt;0. Therefore, we referenced \u201ccyclonic\u201d as clockwise circulation and \u201canticyclonic\u201d\n\nas counter-clockwise circulation.\n\n4.2 The barotropic case\n\nAll the evaluation done in the previous chapters considered the approximation of the\n\nBC observed jet in a 11/2-layer ocean. This consideration is more in accordance with\n\nthe real BC scenario, where the BC flows above the IWBC. However, since we aim\n\nto verify whether barotropic instabilities can generate dipoles along the BC-like jet,\n\nthe evaluation of the purely barotropic configuration is also relevant. However, the\n\nbarotropic QG approximation of the observed BC flow would not be possible, since\n\na vertical integration of transport in the BC-IWBC system would be nearly zero. As\n\nan alternative to that, we opted for prescribing a meridional jet by functions in which\n\ntheir constant parameters can be calibrated in order to generate a jet with the same\n\nkinematics characteristics as the observed BC of Figure 2.6. In the present barotropic\n\ncase, we evolved Equation 4.1 considering q of Equation 4.2.\n\n4.2.1 Open domain\n\nIt is natural to think that the investigation of the BC dynamics involves the presence\n\nof a western boundary. However, looking to the BC flow off Cape Frio scenario, the\n\ncurrent, attached to the continental margin north of Cape Frio, encounters open waters\n\nwhen passing by this location. In an idealized study, we can think in a scenario where a\n\njet, perturbed upstream, leaves the indentation and flows in a open domain. Waterman\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 52\n\n&amp; Jayne [2011] used a similar idea in their theoretical study on the role of eddy-mean\n\nflow interactions in the time-mean dynamics of a zonally evolving, unstable, strongly\n\ninertial jet in a configuration and parameter regime that is relevant to the Kuroshio\n\nextension (e.g., after the jet separates of the western boundary). Their idealized jet\n\nwas perturbed upstream (at the inflow) and was allowed to evolve in a zonal channel\n\nconfigured as a open domain. Considering this idea, we believe the investigation of the\n\nopen domain scenario as very relevant to our study, since we are trying to construct a\n\ntheoretical understanding of the BC dynamics off Cape Frio region and we are focusing\n\non process-based study.\n\nTherefore, the sech2 jet (Equation 4.4) was run in a channel of open boundaries in\n\na grid size of 6000x3000 km, which was big enough so the boundaries did not have\n\nany influence on the dynamics of the interior, and the features that had appeared dur-\n\ning the runs remained in the interior of the channel. The integration time was 300\n\ndays (about 1 year), so we could see the model reach an equilibrium state, that will\n\nbe discussed ahead. We placed the jet flowing along the center of the channel. Hence,\n\none experiment was conducted with a jet that presented BC kinematics characteristics.\n\nSuch experiment is presented in Table 4.1, in which the values are correspondent to the\n\ninflowing steady-state jet. The parameters based on the BC characteristics are: vo, xc, ?\n\n(described in Equation 4.4 and jetw (jet width). The parameter ? was set with the same\n\nvalue of the deformation radius computed for the BC in Chapter 2 (Rd = 36 km).\n\nTable 4.1: Experiment run in the 1-layer barotropic open ocean QG model.\n\nvo (m s?1) xc (km) jetw (km) ?

In all the following\n\nrepresentation of the horizontal fields, only the dynamical relevant part of the channel\n\nwill be shown (the interior). For the open ocean case, the jet was initially perturbed,\n\notherwise, the jet would be totally stable in this configuration. The perturbation used\n\nhere is in the form of a noise applied on the PV field.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 53\n\nAs we have done for the BC profile in Chapter 2 and in the previous section, we\n\ncomputed the Rayleigh and Fj\u00f8rtoft conditions, that give us the necessary but not suffi-\n\ncient conditions for barotropic instabilities. In Rayleigh condition, ?q/?x should change\n\nsignal at least once in the horizontal cross-jet direction. In Fj\u00f8rtoft condition, a similar\n\nexpression states a more robust condition, which is (v? ? vo)?q/?x, and should be pos-\n\nitive at least in one portion of the cross-jet direction. Figure 4.1 center panel shows\n\nthe Rayleigh condition computed, and Figure 4.1 lower panel shown the Fj\u00f8rtoft one.\n\nIn the present case, ?q/?x and (v? ? vo)?q/?x changes sign at least once in the cross-jet\n\ndirection.\n\nThe time evolution of the 1-layer open ocean case is shown in Figures 4.3 and 4.4,\n\nq and ? horizontal fields respectively. The jet starts meandering up to day 30, when\n\nit begins the formation of quasi-paired eddies of opposite signs at each side of the\n\ncurrent, that propagate with the flow. Two bipolar features grow and last until the end\n\nof the run, and they can be seen in the velocity arrows over the ? field of Figure 4.4.\n\nThe jet gets broken in eddies, but the main flow still lasts, and the jet axis is kept. In\n\ngeneral, the eddies formed until day 90 had size of approximately 200 km in diameter,\n\nsame scale as the initial jet width. However, the two dipoles that developed later ended\n\nup growing and reached about 400 km. These large scale features presented a slow-\n\npropagating pattern by the end of the run, so we considered that, from this moment,\n\nthe results were not relevant to our investigation anymore. The propagation of the\n\nfeatures along the channel was approximately 11 km day?1.\n\n4.2.2 Straight western boundary\n\nThe sech2 jet (Equation 4.4) was run in a channel with a straight western boundary , and\n\nin a 6000x3000 km size configuration, which was big enough so the boundaries did not\n\nhave any influence on the dynamics of the interior, and the features that had appeared\n\nduring the runs remained in the interior of the channel. The integration time was 300\n\ndays (about 1 year), so we could see the model reach an equilibrium state, that will be\n\ndiscussed ahead. We constructed several experiments in which we varied the distance\n\nof the jet core (xc) from the coast, which gave us different jet profiles. We selected 4\n\ncases: xc = 100 km, xc = 60 km, xc = 30 km and xc = 10 km. Table 4.2 summarizes\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4.

The parameters based on the BC characteristics are: vo, xc, ? described in Equation\n\n4.4 and jetw (jet width).

In all the following represen-\n\ntation of the horizontal fields, only the dynamical relevant part of the channel will be\n\nshown, e.g. the inflow and interior areas. For the straight coast cases, the jet was ini-\n\ntially perturbed, otherwise, without no source of instability, the jet would be totally\n\nstable in this configuration. The perturbation was the same used for the previous open\n\nocean case (a small noise). Looking to these figures, one can see that the inflowing jet\n\nis directed southward. In each given xc, the jet core gets closer to the wall.\n\nAs we have done for the BC profile in Chapter 2, we computed the Rayleigh and\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4.

Figure 4.8 shows the Rayleigh condition we com-\n\nputed for each case, and Figure 4.9 shown the Fj\u00f8rtoft one. In all the cases, ?q/?x and\n\n(v??vo)?q/?x changes sign at least once in the cross-jet direction. However, as the jet gets\n\nfar away from the coast, more sign changes occur, which may indicates that the jet is\n\ngetting more potentially unstable.\n\nThe time evolution of the 4 cases are shown in Figures 4.10 to 4.17. The xc = 100 km\n\ncase is when the jet is more unstable. It starts meandering and afterwards breaking up\n\nin eddies and bipolar features. Those dipoles propagate with the flow and becomes\n\nnon-paired after a while. In this case, a dipole detaches from the main current and\n\nrecirculates in the interior. Moreover, after about 80 days, eddy-wall interaction takes\n\nplace, forming a counter-current between the southward jet and the wall. This is the\n\ncase we can consider that the jet was unstable enough to generate strong instabilities,\n\nand the nonlinear effects are predominant and dominate the dynamics of the system,\n\nmainly after 100 days. Before that, the propagation of the features along channel was\n\napproximately 6 km day ?1. The typical length scale of the eddies was approximately\n\n130 km in diameter.\n\nIn xc = 60 km, the jet gets unstable latter than the previous case. The initial dipoles\n\npropagate with the jet and leave the domain by the southern boundary. Upstream,\n\nclose to the inflow area, a dipole forms and shifts the jet slightly to the interior, which\n\ngives space for a cyclonic eddy to develop between the wall and the jet, and a eddy-\n\nwall interaction starts. This eddy-wall process starts after 150 days, and at this point,\n\nthe dipole formed recirculates in the interior. The cyclone, instead of evolving to a\n\ncounter-current, stays stationary (centered in the 4000 km of the y axis) until the dipole\n\ntotally recirculates and be absorbed by the jet. From this moment, the impinging dipole\n\ninteracts with the jet and an eddy-wall interaction starts again, forming a counter-\n\ncurrent from day 290. Downstream, the jet keeps flowing southward, characterized by\n\na sequence of cyclone and anticyclones that leave the domain by the southern bound-\n\nary. The propagation of the features along channel was approximately 7.5 km day ?1.\n\nThe typical length scale of the eddies was approximately 120 km in diameter.\n\nThe jet behavior in xc = 30 km case is very similar to the xc = 60 km. The main\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 59\n\ndifference is in the time things start to happen, that is latter in the present one. In\n\nsummary, the jet also develops vortex dipoles along the main axis, and one dipole\n\ndetaches from the current and recirculates. However, it seems there is a tendency of\n\nthe jet to stabilize after about 270 days. Moreover, the recirculated dipole is absorbed\n\nby the current and does not trigger any new instability in the jet. The propagation of\n\nthe features along channel was approximately 7 km day ?1. The typical length scale of\n\nthe eddies was approximately 130 km in diameter.\n\nIn xc = 10 km case, the jet is much more stable, meandering and forming less eddies.\n\nThe anticyclonic ones are predominant, since there exists only the anticyclonic part of\n\nthe jet in this case. Any eddy detaches from the main flow, and they propagate with\n\nthe current southward and leave the domain throughout the southern boundary. The\n\njet starts getting stable upstream as the time goes by, and the formation of eddies stays\n\nrestricted to the downstream region. The propagation of the features along channel\n\nwas approximately 15 km day ?1. The typical length scale of the eddies around day 50\n\nwas approximately 120 km in diameter. Latter (by day 140), the eddies presented some\n\ngrowth and reached about 220 km.\n\nIn all the four case, the model reached what we considered an equilibrium state\n\nby day 300, e.g. in xc = 10 km, the jet presented a steady-state pattern, while in the\n\nothers, it was observed the presence of large scale features which were having a nearly\n\nsteady-state behavior as well (no growth and no propagation). In both situation, we\n\nconsidered the dynamics as not relevant to our analyzes anymore.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4.

We computed K for the 200 m\n\nisobath curve from ETOPO 1 database in Cape Frio region and obtained an approxi-\n\nmate R = 149 km close to the point where the coastline changes direction. We did the\n\nsame to the idealized coastline profile of Equation 4.6 and obtained R = 150 km. There-\n\nfore, the idealized coastline used for the present scenario has a very similar (although\n\nsmoothed) profile of the real one that is actually \u201cfelt\u201d by the WBC (that\u2019s the reason\n\nwhy we used the 200 m isobath as reference). Still in Equation 4.6, the value of 300\n\nwas chosen to sets a realistic difference in the distance between the easternmost and\n\nthe westernmost regions of Cape Frio area.\n\nWe performed a few tests in which we varied the value of the curvature radius,\n\nranging between a smooth varying coastline to a steep one. The results showed us\n\nthat the smoother the coastline variation is, the latter the jet starts getting unstable. We\n\nopted for fixing a given and appropriate value of curvature radius and perform tests\n\nin which we varied the jet profile, as we did in the previous section.\n\nTherefore, the sech2 jet (Equation 4.4) was run in a meridional channel that was\n\nset again to a 6000x3000 km size configuration. Such configuration was big enough\n\nso the boundaries did not have any influence on the dynamics of the interior, and the\n\nfeatures that had appeared during the runs remained in the interior of the channel.\n\nThe integration time was 600 days (about 2 year, double of the previous), so we could\n\nsee the model reach an equilibrium state, that will be discussed ahead. As mentioned,\n\nwe constructed several experiments in which we varied the distance of the jet core\n\nfrom the coast, which gave us different jet profiles. We selected the same 4 cases as\n\nthe previous section: xc = 100 km, xc = 60 km, xc = 30 km and xc = 10 km. Table 4.3\n\nsummarizes these experiments, in which the values are correspondent to the inflowing\n\nsteady-state jet. The parameters based on the BC characteristics are: vo, xc, ? (described\n\nin Equation 4.4) and jetw (jet width). In all the cases we fixed ? as having the same\n\nvalue of the deformation radius computed for the BC in Chapter 2 (Rd = 36 km).\n\nFigure 4.18 shows the initial velocity profiles at the inflow for each case. Figure 4.19\n\nand 4.20 illustrates the initial q and ? horizontal fields. In all the following represen-\n\ntation of the horizontal fields, only the dynamical relevant part of the channel will be\n\nshown, e.g. the inflow and interior areas. For the curvy coast case, we did not per-\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4.

Looking to these figures, one can see\n\nthat the inflowing jet is directed southward. In each given xc, the jet gets closer to the\n\nwall.\n\nFigure 4.21 shows the Rayleigh condition we computed for each case, and Figure\n\n4.22 shown the Fj\u00f8rtoft one. In all the cases, ?q/?x and (v? ? vo)?q/?x changes sign at\n\nleast once in the cross-jet direction. However, as the jet gets far away from the coast,\n\nmore sign changes occurs, which may indicates that the jet is getting more potentially\n\nunstable.\n\nThe time evolution of the 4 cases are shown in Figures 4.23 to 4.30. The xc = 100\n\nkm case is when the jet is more unstable. The current is initially located attached to the\n\nwestern boundary. As soon as the jet encounters the coastline indentation, it \u201dfeels\u201d\n\nthe coastline absence and has room to develop instabilities. It initially forms a dipole,\n\nwhich sets the path for the trailing jet. As the jet tries to return to the western boundary,\n\nit presents a eddy-shedding mode. First an anticyclone (clockwise eddy) forms, and\n\nafterwards, a cyclone occurs at the lee of the indentation. An eddy-wall interaction\n\noccurs in the coastal side of the jet, while a recirculation starts in the interior side,\n\nwhich formed a large scale bipolar structure of about 1500 km in total diameter. The jet\n\nkeeps detached from the coast until the end of the run and presents an eddy-shedding\n\nmode downstream. Typical length scales of these eddies were approximately 200 km,\n\nand the propagation of the features was approximately 8 km day?1.\n\nIn xc = 60 km case, the jet behavior was very similar. It also forms a dipole initially,\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 75\n\nwhich sets the path for the trailing jet. As the jet gets close to the western boundary, this\n\ndipole grows and detaches from the jet and travels to the interior. At the same time,\n\neddy-wall interaction occurs in the coastal side, forming a lee-eddy that also grows and\n\npropagates northward, reaching the jet upstream. This scenario characterized the for-\n\nmation of a large scale slow-propagation dipole. Typical length scales of these eddies\n\nwere approximately 400 km, and the propagation of the features was approximately 7\n\nkm day?1.\n\nThe xc = 30 km case is more stable than the previous cases. Initially there is the\n\nformation of a dipole, that recirculates in the interior and has the anticyclonic part (that\n\ngrows) bigger than the cyclonic part (which vanishes after some time). During this\n\nrecirculation, it is noticeable the jet tries to return to the western boundary. After about\n\n200 days, the jet is attached again to the wall, a lee-eddy forms and the recirculation\n\nremain quasi-stationary. Typical length scales of these eddies were approximately 300\n\nkm, and the propagation of the features was approximately 8 km day?1.\n\nIn xc = 10 km case, the jet is much more stable, meandering and forming less ed-\n\ndies. The anticyclonic ones are predominant, since there exists only the anticyclonic\n\npart of the jet in this case. Any eddy detaches from the main flow, and they propagate\n\nwith the current southward and leave the domain throughout the southern boundary.\n\nThe jet gets stable after 180 days. The propagation of the features along channel was\n\napproximately 10 km day?1 close to the indentation, but south of 4000 km, the prop-\n\nagation velocity increases to 25 km day?1. The typical length scale of the eddies was\n\napproximately 150 km in diameter.\n\nIn all the four case, the model reached what we considered an equilibrium state\n\nby day 300. In xc = 10 km, the jet presented a steady-state pattern (before 300 days),\n\nwhile in the others, it was observed the formation of large scale features, which pre-\n\nsented a slow-propagating pattern. In both situation, we considered the dynamics as\n\nnot relevant to our investigation anymore.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4.

THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 89\n\n4.3 The equivalent-barotropic case\n\nHere we evolved Equation 4.1 considering q of Equation 4.3, and such dynamical ap-\n\nproximation is more in accordance with the BC scenario off Cape Frio region. We are\n\nstill focusing on barotropic instabilities, and again the equivalent-barotropic approx-\n\nimation is very appropriate. The prescribed jet was the sech2 one of Equation 4.4,\n\ncalibrated with the BC characteristics obtained in Chapter 2. The study conducted for\n\nthe 11/2-layer approximation consists only of the open domain case.\n\n4.3.1 Open domain\n\nConsidering the same arguments presented in Section 4.2.1, we investigated a merid-\n\nional BC-like jet in a 11/2-layer open domain model. The model consisted of a channel\n\nwith size 6000x3000 km, and we run for 300 days, which means about 1 year. Here\n\nwe tested one jet profile, such as in Section 4.2.1. Table 4.4 summarizes the 11/2-layer\n\nmodel experiment, in which the values are correspondent to the inflowing steady-state\n\njet. The parameters based on the BC characteristics are: vo, xc, ? (described in Equation\n\n4.4) and jetw (jet width). Such as in the previous sections, we fixed ? as having the\n\nsame value of the deformation radius computed for the BC in Chapter 2 (Rd = 36 km).\n\nTable 4.4: Experiments run in the 11/2-layer open ocean QG model.\n\nvo (m s?1) xc (km) jetw (km) ?

In all the following\n\nrepresentation of the horizontal fields, only the dynamical relevant part of the channel\n\nwill be shown, e.g. the inflow and interior areas. Here, the jet was initially perturbed,\n\notherwise, without no source of instability, the jet would be totally stable in this con-\n\nfiguration. The perturbation was the same used for the previous cases (a small noise).\n\nLooking to these figures, one can see that the inflowing jet is directed southward.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 90\n\nAs we have done for the BC profile in Chapter 2 and in the previous section, we\n\ncomputed the Rayleigh and Fj\u00f8rtoft conditions, that give us the necessary but not suffi-\n\ncient conditions for barotropic instabilities. In Rayleigh condition, ?q/?x should change\n\nsignal at least once in the horizontal cross-jet direction. In Fj\u00f8rtoft condition, a simi-\n\nlar expression states a more robust condition, which is (v? ? vo)?q/?x, and also should\n\nchange signal at least once in the horizontal cross-jet direction. Figure 4.31 center panel\n\nshows the Rayleigh condition we computed for each case, and Figure 4.31 lower panel\n\nshown the Fj\u00f8rtoft one. In the present case, ?q/?x and (v? ?vo)?q/?x changes sign at least\n\nonce in the cross-jet direction.\n\nThe time evolution of the 11/2-layer case is shown in Figures 4.33 to 4.36. Here\n\nboth time and length scales differ considerable from the barotropic case. The first dif-\n\nference was in the integration time period. We run this case for 600 days (double of\n\nthe barotropic cases), since the jet started presenting variations much latter. However,\n\neven at advanced days, the jet was much more stable than the barotropic cases. It\n\nshowed a meandering pattern, but any eddy developed, since we could not see any\n\narrow closing in circles in the velocity fields. The propagation was typically around 6\n\nkm day?1 southward. The typical wavelength of the propagating meanders was of 200\n\nkm during the entire run.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4.

THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 97\n\n4.4 Summary and Discussion\n\nIn the present chapter, we used a QG numerical model to study the downstream evolu-\n\ntion of a potentially barotropically unstable jet. We aimed to investigate and construct\n\na theoretical understanding of the interaction of a southward flowing jet with the lat-\n\neral boundary, and this jet was prescribed based on the BC kinematic characteristics\n\nof the observed current presented in Chapter 4. In order to understand the behavior\n\nof the jet, we selected three different scenarios. The first was the open ocean domain,\n\nwhere we evolved a free inertial jet over the interior of the open ocean. It was our\n\nintent to disregard the effect of the coastline in order the analyze the simplest scenario.\n\nAlthough dynamically simpler, we considered this case relevant and appropriate to\n\nstudy the BC dynamics, since the BC, after passing by Cape Frio, actually encounters\n\nopen waters. Waterman &amp; Jayne [2011] considered the same idea in a theoretical study\n\nof the downstream evolution of an idealized Kuroshio current after the separation from\n\nthe western boundary. The second scenario was a meridional channel domain with a\n\nrectilinear western boundary. The effect of the presence of a wall was included and the\n\njet was imposed flowing attached to it. The third one consisted of a meridional channel\n\ndomain with a curvilinear western boundary. The jet was also imposed attached along\n\nthe wall initially, and the western boundary was construct to resemble the Cape Frio\n\nregion coastline profile. For the three scenarios, we used the barotropic approximation,\n\nand the equivalent-barotropic was applied only in the open ocean domain case.\n\nThe barotropic cases gave us a baseline regarding the interaction of a jet in the\n\nsimplest QG approximation. In open waters, the jet was initially perturbed (a noise\n\nperturbation along the entire PV field), otherwise the inflowing steady-state jet would\n\nnot present variation, since no perturbations were imposed along the domain (such\n\nas topographic or lateral variations). In this case, the jet developed a sequence of op-\n\nposing sign eddies along the channel, results very similar to the scenario presented\n\nby Bell &amp; Pratt [1992], in what they called a \u201dvortex street\u201d. The eddies presented the\n\nsame length scale of the jet horizontal extension and propagated southward, leaving\n\nthe domain by the southern boundary.\n\nIn the straight coast scenario, we presented four cases. In each one, we changed\n\nthe distance of the jet core from the coast, which means we varied the parameter xc\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 98\n\nof Equation 4.4. The change in the jet core position generated different jet profiles.\n\nThe low xc case (xc = 10 km) presented a lower jet width and the horizontal shear\n\nwas restricted to the oceanic side. With the increasing of xc, the jet had a bigger hor-\n\nizontal width and more horizontal shear was gradually added in the coastal side of\n\nthe jet. Consequently, as we increased xc, the jet seemed to be more unstable, and\n\nmore inflexion points in the Rayleigh and Fj\u00f8rtoft criteria were seen. Although we had\n\ntested many values of xc, here we considered relevant to present four cases: xc = 10\n\nkm, xc = 30 km, xc = 60 km, xc = 100 km. We also imposed an initial perturbation\n\nalong the jet, and allowed the flow to respond to it. Besides xc = 10 km case, the jet\n\ngenerate bipolar features downstream as paired eddies that propagated southward, so\n\nbarotropic instabilities actually occurred. A dipole detached from the jet and recircu-\n\nlated in the interior. Eddy-wall interaction as an \u201dimage effect\u201d was observed in xc =\n\n100 km case, and for values higher than 100 km, the jet presented strong eddy-wall\n\ninteraction and a more \u201dchaotic\u201d behavior. Therefore, xc = 100 km was approximately\n\nthe upper limit that separates a weak perturbed continuous flow regime from a highly\n\nunstable regime, not in accordance with typical WBC flows. The xc = 10 km case pre-\n\nsented a very stable behavior. A weak meandering pattern was observed, where the\n\nanticyclones were more prominent. One anticyclonic eddy was formed, but it traveled\n\nwith the jet and left the domain through the southern boundary.\n\nComparing the open ocean domain with the straight coast channel, the main dif-\n\nference was the formation of a recirculating dipole, generated upstream, close to the\n\njet inflow. The horizontal shear in both sides of the current is clearly important for the\n\ngeneration of vortex dipoles and the vortex street patterns observed, and these are sce-\n\nnarios comparable with the BC in southeast area of the Brazilian continental margin.\n\nIn the curvy coastline scenario, we tested the same four xc values and allowed the\n\njet to interact with a variant coastline, which was idealistic constructed to resemble\n\nthe real one off Cape Frio region. No perturbations were imposed initially, since we\n\nintended to isolate the effect of the coast variation. Such perturbation was sufficient\n\nto make the jet unstable in all the four cases. Initially, a dipole was formed close to\n\nthe indentation area and set the path for the trailing jet. In general, the trailing jet\n\ndeveloped a cyclone, which located at the lee of the coastline indentation at least for\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 99\n\nsome time. The initial dipole recirculated and was absorbed latter by the flow. The\n\nhigher values of xc presented eddy-wall interaction at some point in the run and the\n\nxc = 100 km case limited the weak perturbed continuous flow regime from a highly\n\nunstable regime, where nonlinearities dominate the dynamics.. As the jet core got\n\ncloser to the wall, it was clearer the tendency of returning to the western boundary.\n\nComparing the curvy coastline with the straight coastline scenario, similar behaviors\n\nwere observed. Dipoles were formed initially, and a meandering pattern composed\n\nby eddies of opposing sign was observed downstream. In the xc = 10 km cases, the\n\njet presented similar behavior as well, where we had a very stable flow that formed\n\none anticyclone that propagated southward and left the domain. It was also noticed\n\nthat in both cases, as the jet got closer to the wall, it became more stable, and it started\n\ngenerating features latter.\n\nIn the 11/2-layer case, we have presented one case, which was a initially perturbed\n\njet in a open ocean domain. The jet started developing perturbations much latter than\n\nthe 1-layer one, and a meandering pattern was observed, resembling a southward-\n\npropagating wave with wavelength of 200 km and 6 km day?1 of phase velocity. Al-\n\nthough we could set up the 11/2-layer approximation only for the open domain sce-\n\nnario, it seems the relatively weak stratification effect can produce differences in the\n\nflow. Comparing the two open ocean domain cases, the length scales of the features\n\nwere very similar, but the time scales differed, where the 1-layer case had approxi-\n\nmately the double of the propagation velocity of the 11/2-layer case. Flierl [1999] applied\n\nan hybrid model (with piecewise constant potential vorticity in the upper layer and a\n\ndeep layer initially at rest) and a contour dynamics model and demonstrated that, the\n\nbarotropic mode plays a fundamental role in the long-wave dynamics. For f plane jets,\n\nit leads to unstable waves whereas the n1/2-layer models have stable waves. Ring for-\n\nmation appears to occur via an initial stage of baroclinic growth - a \u201dheton\u201d mechanism\n\nwhereby opposite-signed upper and lower layer PV anomalies propel each other away\n\nfrom the jet axis. At latter stages, the equivalent-barotropic dynamics acts to pinch off\n\nthe eddy. Comparing his results with the ones we obtained here, we did have a more\n\nstable jet in the open ocean 11/2-layer case, where a stable wave pattern was obtained.\n\nAdditionally, they showed the importance of the baroclinic effect in generating eddies,\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 100\n\nso we imagine that this approximation would promote the development of eddies in\n\nour idealized scenarios. The equivalent-barotropic study certainly must be better ex-\n\nplored, in the sense of including this approximation in a channel and considering a\n\ncurvy coastline. Moreover, from the preliminary results we obtained here, it seems\n\nthe model parameters and scales applied did not work as good as for the barotropic\n\napproximation, since no eddies grew. Probably, the baroclinic approximation excite\n\nunstable wavelengths that are different from the barotropic one, and our model con-\n\nfiguration could not allow these wavelengths to manifest. In other words, we need to\n\nstudy what the ideal scales are when configuring a baroclinic jet, even in its simplest\n\napproximation.\n\nThe results obtained in xc = 100 km and xc = 60 km for the curvy coastline de-\n\nserves special attention. The initial vortex dipole evolved to a scenario of southward-\n\npropagating opposing signs eddies located upstream, at least during some periods of\n\nthe runs. Such dipole also seemed to trigger instabilities downstream, translated in a\n\nsouthward-propagating wave pattern. This specific situations resembled the observed\n\npictures we presented in Chapter 1 for the BC off Cape Frio and southeast Brazilian\n\ncoast, illustrated again in Figure 4.38. It seems the indentation triggers the formation\n\nof a vortex-dipole, which besides setting the path for the trailing jet, made it unstable\n\nand favorable to develop new eddies right upstream. The dipole eventually detached\n\nfrom the jet, but the current remained unstable and evolved to a scenario of opposing\n\nsigns eddies. We have selected four snapshots to illustrate this description, and they\n\ncan be seen in Figure 4.37. It is important to point out that the comparison is merely\n\nqualitative. The scales of the observed features in Figure 4.38 are much smaller than\n\nthe scales we obtained in the runs, and it is expected since the purely barotropic scales\n\nare greater. Verron et al. [1991] mentioned that studies that had investigated the dynam-\n\nics of a flow past a cape under the homogeneous rotating QG framework obtained, in\n\ngeneral, eddies forming at the apex, either propagating downstream as isolated eddies\n\nor combining to form larger scale eddies. In the snapshots of Figure 4.37, right panels,\n\nwe also obtained this combination of eddies that formed larger features, although here\n\nwe have an indentation instead of a cape. After day 300, the eddies combined to form\n\ngrowing slow-propagating large scale features until the end of the run. Still in Verron\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 101\n\net al. [1991], they also investigated the evolution of a eastward zonal flow past a cape\n\nunder the homogeneous (barotropic) QG framework, and tested different cases where\n\nthey varied the Reynolds number Re. This parameter compares the strength of the jet\n\nwith the friction intensity, and is defined as Re = UL/? (U and L are the typical veloc-\n\nity and length scales of the jet, and ? is the fluid turbulent viscosity). Re appears in\n\nthe nondimensional PV equation when considering the importance of lateral friction.\n\nThey obtained attached lee anticyclones (clockwise rotation since they were consider-\n\ning northern hemisphere) at the rear face of the cape at low Reynolds number (strong\n\nfriction), and for high Reynolds number (weak friction), attached eddies were formed\n\nand shed periodically from the cape. Here we have not tried experiments with the in-\n\nclusion of the lateral friction term, but the comparison with that study is relevant since\n\nhere we also dealt with a barotropic QG numerical model. In our results, after the\n\njet passed by the indentation, it tended to form also a clockwise motion. If we rotate\n\nour reference framework to be equivalent to them, the inflowing jet past the coastline\n\nperturbation demonstrated similar behavior. Here, an eddy-shedding mode was also\n\nobserved after the flow passed the indentation, but only in the case where the jet was\n\ncloser to the wall. In Verron et al. [1991], this mode was obtained with high Re (e.g.\n\nweak friction), and here we considered a frictionless ocean. Anyways, as we shifted\n\nthe jet core offshore, lee eddies started to appear, and we had periods that these eddies\n\nwere steady for a considerable time. In our case, the horizontal shear strength at the\n\ncoastal side of the jet seems to be comparable to the consideration of lateral friction. A\n\nweak or absent shear (such as in xc = 10 km and xc = 30 km) is equivalent to a weak\n\nfriction, and the jet tends to a eddy-shedding regime. In the other hand, a strong shear\n\n(such as in xc = 60 km and xc = 100 km) is equivalent to a stronger friction, and the lee\n\neddy regime is favored.\n\nAlthough the effect of vertical shear may play an important role on the dynamics\n\nof the BC off southeast Brazil, and the 11/2- or 2-layer approximation would be more\n\nrealistic in terms of dynamical simplifications, the barotropic approximation presented\n\ninteresting results already. Barotropic instabilities do generate bipolar features when\n\nthe jet presents horizontal shear. Moreover, an eddy-shedding mode is observed after\n\nthe dipole formation, at least during an specific period of the integration time. The\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4.

THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 104\n\nshear in the coastal side is essential to allow all the process described above to happen.\n\nIn all the four cases of the curvy coastline case, it was observed that anticyclonic eddies\n\nwere formed more frequently than cyclones. We mentioned the possible importance\n\nof the horizontal shear, in which the oceanic side was always present and it was favor-\n\nable to the formation of anticyclones. However, Verron et al. [1991] pointed out that in\n\nrotating case such as the one they investigated, it was observed asymmetry in terms of\n\noccurrence and form in cyclones and anticyclones. The cyclonic eddies were smaller\n\nand shed slower than the anticyclonic eddies.\n\nA similar study in terms of dynamical approximation was conducted by Munday\n\n&amp; Marshall [2005]. In their investigation, the problem of western boundary current\n\nseparation is investigated using a barotropic vorticity model. Specifically, a bound-\n\nary current flowing poleward along a boundary containing a cape is considered. The\n\nmeridional gradient of the Coriolis parameter (the ? effect), the strength of dissipation\n\n(represented by the Reynolds number Re), and the geometry of the cape are varied.\n\nThey found that (i) all instances of flow separation are coincident with the presence of\n\na flow deceleration; (ii) an increase in the strength of the beta effect is able to suppress\n\nflow separation; and (iii) increasing coastline curvature can overcome the suppressive\n\nbeta effect and induce separation. They cited that a change in direction of the coastline\n\ncan decelerate a boundary current and induce its flow separation. Although we are not\n\ntesting a cape shape in our western boundary, some accelerations/deceleration process\n\nmight have occurred in our results. Anyways, they obtained that an increase in cur-\n\nvature promotes flow separation, while small curvatures results in an fully attached\n\nflow regime. Although not showed here, we performed a few tests in which we varied\n\nthe coastline curvature, and we also obtained the Munday &amp; Marshall [2005] pattern.\n\nSmall curvature results in high curvature radius, which results in a smoother coast-\n\nline profile. Hence, it exerts less perturbation in the flow. The smoother the coastline\n\n(e.g., close to a straight coast), the less unstable is the jet. These results regarding coast-\n\nline curvature corroborate the investigation of Stern &amp; Whitehead [1990]. These authors\n\nperformed an evaluation of variations in coastline curvature, but the shape was very\n\nsimilar to our case, e.g., an indentation where the coastline changes direction. They\n\nused the barotropic approximation with no viscous forcing neither variation of plane-\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 105\n\ntary vorticity. They obtained a critical value of the angle of change that separated two\n\ndifferent regimes. A high obtuse angle (small curvature) promotes an eddy attached\n\nregime where the flow tends to pass by the cape attached to the wall or shedding eddies\n\nthat propagate downstream. Those eddies were cyclonic in their experiments (counter-\n\nclockwise because f was positive), just like in our results of attached regime. A low\n\nangle (high curvature) makes the jet to separate from the coast and a mushroom-like\n\nstructure is formed, setting the path for the trailing jet. Their results also indicate that\n\nperturbations in the coastline can induce the jet to form bipolar features in a homoge-\n\nneous ocean through barotropic instabilities. The dipole formation case also presented\n\na recirculating pattern, and this was obtained in our results.\n\nGenerally speaking, in the 1-layer cases, barotropic instabilities generated bipolar\n\nfeatures. The presence of a simple rectilinear coastline made the dipole to detach from\n\nthe jet, but in the curvy coast the jet had room to interact with open water when it sepa-\n\nrates from the indentation. The bipolar features, although apparently very intense, did\n\nnot make the jet discontinuous, and this fact made possible the formation of eddies\n\nin the downstream region. Stratification may play an important role in determining\n\nthe type of regime a jet presents when interacting with the coastal variations, whether\n\nit is eddy-shedding, eddy-attached and so on. For instance, Magaldi et al. [2008] and\n\nCastelao &amp; Barth [2006] investigated the role of stratification in idealized scenarios of a\n\nflow past a cape using a primitive equation numerical model and could obtain distinct\n\nregimes. Magaldi et al. [2008] designed a fully idealized experiment where a steady jet\n\nimpinges on an obstacle (triangular cape) in a rotating and linearly stratified environ-\n\nment. They kept the small Rossby number constant and did sensitivity runs varying\n\nthe Burger Number (Bu),\n\nBu =\n\n(\nRd\nD\n\n)2\n, (4.8)\n\nwhich measures the ratio between baroclinic deformation radius (Rd) and the length\n\nscale of the obstacle (D). In their experiment of a zonal homogeneous flow (Bu = 0),\n\nthey obtained the generation of small anticyclones in the stripe over slope topography\n\nthat propagated downstream. For low Bu, e.g., Bu &lt;0.1 (weak stratification), a fully\n\nattached regime is established, and the jet flows smoothly over the cape. For interme-\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 106\n\ndiate Bu, e.g., 0.1 &lt;Bu &lt;1, fluid parcels flow more around the obstacle than over\n\nit. Flow separation occurs and small tip eddies start to shed. The increasing of Bu\n\nshifts the system from a eddy-attached regime (where eddies are formed behind the\n\ncape and shed downstream) to a lee eddy regime (where small lee eddies are formed\n\nand grow behind the cape). For high Bu, e.g., Bu > 1, (strong stratification), tip eddies\n\nmerge to form larger eddies in the lee of the cape. Our results are comparable with\n\nthe regime of Bu = 0 obtained by the authors, where they obtained the generation of\n\nsmall anticyclones propagating downstream. The authors mentioned that the presence\n\nof stratification, even if very weak, changes the dynamics considerably.\n\nThe discussion above took us to obtain some conclusion. The strength of the jet\n\nhorizontal shear determines the regime the flow is going to present. More specifically,\n\nthe shear at the coastal side of the jet is key to obtain changes in the unstable jet be-\n\nhavior. The absence of shear in the coastal side makes the jet more stable and an eddy\n\nattached or fully attached flow regimes are promoted. As we increase the coastal shear,\n\nthe tendency of jet separation also increases, and we obtain two concomitants scenar-\n\nios: formation of vortex-dipoles and the latter establishment of larger scales lee eddies\n\nfollowed downstream by other eddies.\n\nIt is important to point out that, given the model configuration and initial condi-\n\ntions, we are only allowing the formation of meanders and eddies due to barotropic\n\ninstability. Hence, the physical process we had isolated here was the horizontal shear.\n\nRossby waves and other large scale waves are being filtered here, since the parameter ?\n\n= 0 (we are using the f plane) and we are not considering a sloping bottom (the bottom\n\nis flat). So, we are absolutely not forcing the model with topographic Rossby waves,\n\nalthough this was one of the processes suggested by Silveira et al. [2000] when he com-\n\npares the BC scenario off southeast Brazilian coast with the GS warm outbreaks. The\n\nappearance of topographic Rossby waves would be possible if the model could have\n\nat least one region shallower than a second one. The planetary Rossby waves needs\n\nthe variation of f to appear, and this effect would be effective only in a zonal jet.\n\nThe effect of friction due to the presence of a solid boundary is being ignored here,\n\nalthough several studies consider this process in determining the formation of vortical\n\nstructures and shedding regimes. Another aspect considered to play important role\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 107\n\non the formation of such features is accelerations and decelerations in the flow, which\n\ncan be promoted by solid barriers such as capes. Our coastline profile does not have a\n\nbarrier effect in the jet, so we think this effect is unlikely to be happening here.\n\nIt seems the barotropic approximation requires different temporal and spatial scales\n\nif compared to the approximations that consider the stratification. In our study, the\n\nbarotropic scenario comparable to past studies such as Verron et al. [1991] (weak fric-\n\ntion) and Magaldi et al. [2008] (homogeneous ocean) was with xc = 10 km. It seems\n\nthat using the same jet (fixed Ro) for both homogeneous and stratified scenarios re-\n\nsults in having a more stable scenario in the equivalent-barotropic case. This is prob-\n\nably due to the fact that the baroclinic scales excite unstable waves with wavelengths\n\nvery different from the barotropic approximation, and the configuration applied in the\n\nQG model could not allow these scales to manifest. So the \u201dmore stable\u201d results actu-\n\nally indicated the equivalent-barotropic approximation needs adjustments to allow the\n\nbaroclinic scales to excite appropriated unstable waves.\n\nFinally, it is important to highlight that our goals number 4 presented in Section\n\n1.2 were accomplished in the present chapter, e.g we examined the interaction of a\n\nbarotropically unstable meridional jet and a western boundary in idealized configu-\n\nrations relevant to BC jet system, in particular the role of lateral boundary variations\n\nin making the jet unstable and able to generate eddies and dipoles. The perturbation\n\nas a varying boundary is sufficient to excite the formation of barotropic dipoles, and\n\nthe presence of the lateral boundary can make these dipoles to detach from the jet, e.g.\n\nthey not necessarily keep associated to the current main axis all the time. In the next\n\nchapter, we will try to address the stratification effect still ignoring the presence and\n\ninteraction with the IWBC.\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe primitive equations numerical\n\nmodel\n\nThis chapter aims to investigate the BC dipoles dynamics in a more complex frame-\n\nwork in terms of dynamical simplification. Here we added to a primitive numerical\n\nmodel the technique know as Feature-Oriented Regional Modeling System (FORMS).\n\nThe idea is to create the initial conditions of the numerical model through the con-\n\nstruction of parametric features that were done based on previous observations of\n\nthe study area. Therefore, our parametric feature consisted of a jet along the western\n\nboundary which presented the same kinematic characteristics of the BC. Therefore, we\n\nimplemented the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) in an idealized scenario,\n\nwhere there is only a BC-like jet (potentially barotropically unstable) flowing along the\n\nBrazilian coast. Here, the more complex oceanic scenario is composed by real topogra-\n\nphy and a density field background (necessary for the ROMS initial conditions). The\n\nFORMS methodology and its implementation in ROMS will be presented in the next\n\nsection.\n\n5.1 Methodology\n\nAccording to Gangopadhyay &amp; Robinson [2002], each oceanic region, however unique in\n\ntheir individual behavior, consists of a number of generic or common characteristic syn-\n\noptic circulation structures. These synoptic entities or features, when put together in\n\n108\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. THE PRIMITIVE EQUATIONS NUMERICAL MODEL 109\n\na particular region, interact and evolve to generate the combined circulation variabil-\n\nity due to different regional set-up of multi-scale processes, bathymetry, boundaries\n\nand forcing due to winds and buoyancy. This approach, called feature-oriented re-\n\ngional modeling system (FORMS) [Gangopadhyay &amp; Robinson, 2002], consists of empiri-\n\ncally/analytically creating initial and/or boundary conditions for momentum/tracers\n\nfor primitive equation model simulations. The technique is widely used for atmo-\n\nspheric and ocean nowcasting and forecasting [Robinson et al., 1988, 1989; Spall &amp; Robin-\n\nson, 1990; Fox et al., 1992; Hurlburt et al., 1992; Cummings et al., 1997; Gangopadhyay et al.,\n\n1997; Robinson &amp; Glen, 1999; Gangopadhyay et al., 2003; Calado et al., 2008, 2010], but it is\n\nalso applicable for feature-oriented process studies, as we aim here.\n\nAccording to the methodology developed by Gangopadhyay &amp; Robinson [2002], when\n\nthe typical characteristics of the features from previous observations or studies are\n\nknown, we can parameterize them and use as input for different process studies nu-\n\nmerical experiments and study their dynamical processes. The empirical-analytical\n\ndesign formulation of the three-dimensional velocity and water mass structures of a\n\nfeature is called the feature model (FM).\n\nWe use this technique to analytically create the time-averaged smooth BC flow off\n\nsoutheast Brazilian coast. We ignored the presence of IWBC (as we did in Chapters 3\n\nand 4) since we still don\u2019t want to incorporate the effect of a strong vertical shear in the\n\nsystem, although some shear does exists along the BC flow. Then our FM is represented\n\nby a BC-like jet, which is required to meet observation-based kinematic characteristics\n\n(obtained in Chapter 2) and mass conservation criteria. This field is then interpolated\n\nto a numerical model grid with the best available bathymetry, and allowed to evolve\n\nfor one year. This period is typically a minimum time spawn to see the development\n\nof mesoscale variability. The 3D field construction will be detailed in the next section.\n\n5.1.1 Formulation of the idealized system\n\nVelocity FMs can be designed through two main approaches [Lozano et al., 1996]: for-\n\nward approach and backward approach. The forward approach consists of parame-\n\nterizing the shape of T and S surfaces that composes the baroclinic pressure gradients\n\nthat are in geostrophic balance with the velocity structures of interest. In this case, the\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. THE PRIMITIVE EQUATIONS NUMERICAL MODEL 110\n\nassociated velocity field may be computed by the primitive equation model or before-\n\nhand. In the backward approach, the exact aimed velocity structure is parameterized\n\nand the tracers are computed afterwards through a variety of methods [Gangopadhyay\n\n&amp; Robinson, 2002]. In this work, both velocity and tracers are considered as the initial\n\nfield to the primitive equation ocean model. Generally, the choice of either approach is\n\nbased on the available source of observations. Availability of direct velocity measure-\n\nments favors the backward approach; and availability of tracers observations favors\n\nthe forward approach. The velocity-based backward approach is also more suitable\n\nfor current or front-dominated regions. In the present process-study work, the back-\n\nward approach is employed.\n\nIn stage 1 of the FM backward approach, a quasi-meridional jet (which represents\n\nthe BC flow) is parameterized. Since we are using real topography data (ETOPO1 data\n\nbase), the jet along the western boundary is not fully meridionally-oriented. In stage\n\n2, geostrophically balanced potential temperature (T ) and salinity (S) fields are com-\n\nputed from the FM 3D velocity field. The last stage consists in computing the remain-\n\ning prognostic variables required by the numerical model as initial conditions, which\n\nare the depth-averaged velocity field and the sea surface height (SSH). The application\n\nof each one of these stages is detailed in the following paragraphs.\n\nStarting with stage 1, the orientation of the system defined within the study area is\n\na natural coordinate frame of reference, where x is the cross-stream axis, y is the along\n\nstream axis and z is the vertical axis. The y axis is roughly parallel to the isobath of\n\n200 m, which represents the interface between the coastal and the deep oceans. For the\n\nBC-like jet construction, we considered the jet core always at surface. Now we aim to\n\nmodel a jet that is surface-intensified and keeps the same transport at the inflow and\n\noutflow regions. So, BC horizontal cross-jet structure is parametrized by Equation 5.1\n\nas\n\nvh = vc sech\n2\n\n(\nx?xc\n?\n\n)\n, (5.1)\n\nwhich describes the same Bickley jet used in Chapter 4, with a constant amplitude\n\ndefined by vc. For the cross-stream structure, a constant width proportional to ? is\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. THE PRIMITIVE EQUATIONS NUMERICAL MODEL 111\n\nadopted, and xc defines the position where the jet core occurs. This position xc is also\n\nconsidered constant to keep the system at a fixed distance from the shelf break, roughly\n\nfollowing the local topography. Hereinafter, the subscript c refers to core, which is\n\nwhere the maximum velocity of the jet occurs at a given y location.\n\nFor the BC vertical structure, we incorporate the variation in z through a Gaussian\n\nvariation as\n\nvz = vc exp\n\n[\n?\n\n(z ?zc)2\n\n2?2b\n\n]\n, at z &lt;0. (5.2)\n\nwhere the parameter ?b refers to the vertical length of the Gaussian decay, proportional\n\nto the jet vertical extension.\n\nThe graphical representation of all the relevant FM parameters are presented in by\n\nFigure 5.1. The choice of the parameters was based in the observational data presented\n\nin Chapter 2, so realistic jet positions, width, thickness, maximum velocities and trans-\n\nports were aimed. The current transport was computed analytically by integrating\n\nEquation 5.1 from ?? to ?, which results in the simple expression\n\nT = vc ?(?t + ?b). (5.3)\n\nStage 2 consists in computing T and S fields by inverting the thermal wind relation\n\nand using a linearized version of the equation of state, as in Schmidt et al. [2007] and\n\nFernandes [2007]. We use local climatological T , S and potential density (?) regional av-\n\neraged vertical profiles to keep water masses and stratification within a realistic range.\n\nThe first step to obtain T and S is to compute ?, from the thermal wind equation\n\nf0\n?v\n\n?z\n= ?\n\ng\n\n??\n\n??\n\n?x\n, (5.4)\n\nwhere f is the Coriolis parameter, v is interpreted as the along-shelf velocity and ?? is\n\nthe reference density (1027 kg m?3, from climatology). Integrating Eq. 5.4 in respect to\n\nx, we get an expression to ?, which is\n\n?(x,z) = ?(0,z) ?\nf0??\n\ng\n\n? L\n0\n\n?v\n\n?z\ndx, (5.5)\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. THE PRIMITIVE EQUATIONS NUMERICAL MODEL 112\n\nwhere ?(0,z) is a mean density profile (also obtained from climatology) at the initial\n\nlocation of the transect and L is the length of the transect. Figure 5.2 show the resulting\n\n?? fields computed from Figure 5.1 velocity fields. Figures 5.3 and 5.4 show how the\n\nresulting system sets horizontally, after computing all the transects in the study area\n\ndomain. Therefore, the adopted parameters for the velocity-based BC FM system were:\n\nxc = 160 km, ? = 36 km, zc = 0 m, ?b/2 = 300 m and vc = 70 cm s?1. The resulting transport\n\nwas T = 5 Sv.\n\nThe T ? S fields, which are actually required for the primitive equation model as\n\ninitial and boundary conditions, are computed through\n\n?(x,z) = ??[1 + ??S0(z) ? ??T (x,z)], (5.6)\n\nwhich is a bi-dimensional linearized equation of state used by Fernandes [2007]. Mean\n\nhaline contraction coefficient is represented by ?? (8.0 \u00d7 10?4), ?? is the mean thermal\n\nexpansion coefficient (2.2 \u00d7 10?4 ?C?1) and S0 is a mean S profile computed from cli-\n\nmatology. Temperature is then computed by re-arranging Equation 5.6 as\n\nT(x,z) =\n\n??\n??\n\n+ 1 + ??S0(z)\n\n??\n, (5.7)\n\nand salinity is obtained following Fernandes [2007] by Equation 5.8,\n\nS(x,z) = S0(z) ? 10?2T(x,z). (5.8)\n\nFinally, in stage 3, to complete the prognostic variables required by the numeri-\n\ncal model, depth-averaged flow and SSH are computed. In that case, SSH is simply\n\ncomputed through\n\nSSH =\n??\n\ng\n, (5.9)\n\nwhere the geopotential anomaly (??) is obtained through S and T using 1200 m as\n\nlevel of no motion.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5.

THE PRIMITIVE EQUATIONS NUMERICAL MODEL 115\n\n5.1.2 Model implementation\n\nThe primitive equation model chosen for this study is the Regional Ocean Modeling\n\nSystem (ROMS) [Shchepetkin &amp; McWillians, 2005]. ROMS has curvilinear horizontal\n\ncoordinate system and terrain-following in the vertical. The model domain for our\n\narea has a 1/24? resolution with 220 x 210 grid points, comprising the area 14?S to 35?S\n\nand 54?W to 32?W, as in Figure 5.5. The total number of vertical levels is 20. For the\n\ntopography configuration, ETOPO1 is truncated in 1500 m and than interpolated to\n\nthe grid, minimizing pressure gradient errors by restricting the bathymetry gradients\n\nunder an r-factor of 0.2 [Haidvogel et al., 2000]. Additionally, the inflow and outflow\n\nregions were configured to have a meridionally rectilinear orientation, and only the\n\narea comprised by 22?S to 29?S kept the real topographic variation (Figure 5.5). In\n\nthis sense, we intended to configure an steady-state inflowing jet and introduce the\n\ntopographic perturbation only in the region of interest, which was Cape Frio and Cape\n\nSa?o Tome? areas, similarly to the approach used in Chapter 4.\n\nModel Topography\n\nFigure 5.5: Numerical model grid and bathymetric configuration based on ETOPO 1 real\ntopography truncated in 1500 m. The blue contour represents depths shallower than 100 m\nand the dashed line is the smoothed shallow- deep ocean interface that serves as origin for the\nFM transects. Note the idealized meridionally rectilinear continental margin in the inflow and\noutflow regions.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. THE PRIMITIVE EQUATIONS NUMERICAL MODEL 116\n\nVertical mixing of momentum and tracers is done by the k-profile turbulent closure\n\nmodel by Large et al. [1994]. Harmonic horizontal mixing and diffusivity are used both\n\nwith 5 m2s?1 coefficients in the interior of the domain and a mild sponge layer of six\n\ngrid points is applied at the open boundaries (N, S, E), linearly increasing the viscosity\n\nup to 50 m2s?1. At the three open boundaries, we follow Peliz et al. [2003] approach by\n\nkeeping the FM fields nearly steady through the use of strong relaxation in a layer of six\n\ngrid points. Nudging time scales vary from 6 to 1 day from the interior to the boundary.\n\nIn order to avoid reflections of the flow, additional active/passive conditions were also\n\nused at the boundaries [Marchesiello et al., 2001], with strong inflow time scale of 1 day.\n\nIn the experiment, the FM field is interpolated to ROMS grid with its bathymetry\n\nsetup. No other forcing are imposed, so all the dynamics are consequence of one year\n\nevolution of the initial field interacting with itself and the topography.\n\n5.2 Results\n\nBefore we start the description of our ROMS experiment results, we would like to\n\nhighlight some characteristics of the initial jet, and compare them with the parameters\n\nwe used for the jets in Chapter 4. The jet core position here was more offshore. In\n\nthe QG experiments, the higher value of this parameter was xc = 100 km. Here, we\n\nused xc = 160 km for a more appropriate fit of the jet with the real topography. We\n\nhave to remember that the real topography presents a slope region. Therefore, the\n\nhigher value allowed that the prescribed jet could be configured to have the vertical\n\nextension with no interference from the shallower regions of the slope. Moreover, the\n\nparameter ?, which defines the jet width, was the same as the QG experiments (? =\n\n36 km), which corresponds to the value of the Rossby deformation radius Rd in the\n\nregion. The parameters that define the vertical structure of the jet were not necessary\n\nin the QG experiments, since we were using the approximation of homogeneous ocean\n\nthere.\n\nFigure 5.6 illustrates the velocity vertical section at the inflow region (20 ?S) corre-\n\nspondent to the first day of run. One can see the jet nicely adjusted to the topographic\n\nconfiguration, where the coastal border is close to the continental shelf break. The core\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5.

The jet\n\nhorizontal extension is about 110 km, while the vertical extension is 700 m of depth.\n\nIn order to assure the initial jet is potentially barotropically unstable, we tested the\n\nRayleigh and Fj\u00f8rtoft conditions (discussed in Chapter 2). To do so, firstly we obtained\n\nthe velocity cross-jet profile correspondent to Figure 5.6 at the surface (z = 0). Such pro-\n\nfile is illustrated in Figure 5.7 (upper panel). The PV profile is illustrated in 5.7 (lower\n\npanel). The Rayleigh and Fj\u00f8rtoft profiles obtained from the velocity profile are both\n\nrepresented in Figure 5.8 (upper and lower panels respectively).\n\nThe results obtained in the ROMS experiment are shown in Figures 5.9 and 5.10,\n\nwhere we chose a sequence of 12 snapshots representative of 31 days of run. In the\n\nplots, we are showing only the area we are focusing in (which comprises the region\n\nof real topographic variation). The idealized inflow and outflow regions are partially\n\nshowed with the intention of giving a better visualization of the inflowing jet.\n\nDuring the 31 days period, we could see the jet interacting with the changes in to-\n\npography. The BC jet is initially following the continental margin and we start to see\n\nmeandering by day 9. In days 12 to 15, around the parallel of 23?S, the jet seems to\n\ntend to form a cyclonic eddy or meander in its coastal side and an anticyclonic eddy\n\nis formed in its oceanic side. This apparently indicates the tendency of dipole genera-\n\ntion. This instability seems to have had origin due to the change in the 200 m isobath\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5.

At the same time, we can see the mean-\n\nders intensifying in the downstream region of the area (around 27?S). After day 17, the\n\nbipolar feature in Cape Frio developed, started presenting growth and intensified. The\n\nprocess can be seen in days 17 to 31. During this period, the jet started presenting some\n\ninstabilities right off Cape Sa?o Tome? (parallel of 22?S), and it started forming an anti-\n\ncyclonic eddy. This eddy also presented growth and extended meridionally, forcing\n\nthe jet upstream. By day 27, the Cape Sa?o Tome? anticyclone and Cape Frio dipole are\n\nformed and established, and two anticyclonic eddies appeared downstream, centered\n\nin 27?S and 29?S. The Cape Frio vortex-dipole presented a weak propagation down-\n\nstream, where the anticyclonic side developed more and presented higher dimensions\n\nthan the cyclonic one. The horizontal dimensions of the final features were about 200\n\nkm.\n\nIn order to have more insight in the formation of the bipolar structure we specu-\n\nlated in the previous paragraph, we looked to the vertical velocity section in day 30,\n\nwhere we obtained a zonal slice of the field centered in 24?S. Figure 5.11 illustrates\n\nsuch vertical section. It is possible to see the BC current (represented by the negative\n\nvelocity values) associated with positive velocities in both sides of its flow. The jet core\n\nshifted offshore, and now it is centered in 42?W. This indicates the jet had some sep-\n\naration from the coast probably due to the change in coastline orientation. Moreover,\n\nthis configuration seem to be favorable to the formation of a yet incipient dipole.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5.

As we did in Chapter 4, we prescribed a BC-like jet using the\n\ntechnique known as Feature-Oriented Regional Modeling System (FORMS). The jet\n\nwas potentially barotropically unstable due to horizontal shear, and a weak vertical\n\nshear had to be included in order to reproduce a realistic BC. Two important character-\n\nistics were introduced here: real topography and stratification effect. Here, the ocean\n\nis continuously stratified, and, although only one jet was prescribed along the domain\n\n(we ignored the IWBC jet), a weak vertical shear is present, which means baroclinic\n\ninstability may occur concomitantly with barotropic instability. The real topography\n\nnot only incorporates changes in coastline orientation, but also includes the slope.\n\nWithin the set of parameters relevant to the BC characteristics and applied here, it is\n\nclear the jet showed perturbations located where there is changes in coastline orienta-\n\ntion. It seems we obtained the formation of a bipolar feature right off Cape Frio, since\n\nthe feature was depicted in the vertical velocity section of Figure 5.11. Such structure\n\npresented (in day 31) about 200 km of diameter and had the same length scale and\n\nposition obtained by Pereira [2009]. Figure 5.12 illustrated a zoom of the right lower\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. THE PRIMITIVE EQUATIONS NUMERICAL MODEL 124\n\npanel of Figure 5.10, so the reader can have a better looking into the feature scales.\n\nDownstream of the dipole, a wave-like pattern is present and some anticyclones\n\nwere formed. This scenario resembles the one obtained by Campos et al. [1996] and\n\ndepicted in our simulation of Chapter 3, e.g. the formation of a dipole upstream and a\n\nsequence of eddies downstream. Here we cannot say we obtained a sequence of several\n\neddies, but we speculate this results could evolve to a similar scenario afterwards.\n\nTrying to have some insights of the dynamics of our simulation, we used the QG\n\nframework and evaluated the BC-like flow in terms of this approximation. Firstly, we\n\ncomputed the Rossby number according to Equation ??, where\n\nRo =\n\n(\n?v\n?x\n? ?u\n\n?y\n\n)\n|f0|\n\n, (5.10)\n\nfor the BC jet at the inflow. We obtained Ro = 0.2, which indicates the system can be\n\nexplained by the QG approximation. Going further in our dynamical analyses, we\n\nfollowed once again Magaldi et al. [2008], as we did in Chapter 4. So we evaluated\n\nthe coastline curvature and compared with the jet deformation radius, according to\n\nEquation 4.8, and obtained Bu = 8.20. This calculation was conducted for the initial jet.\n\nAs discussed by Magaldi et al. [2008], they obtained a pattern, where for low Bu, e.g.,\n\nBu &lt;0.1 (weak stratification), a fully attached regime is established, and the jet flows\n\nsmoothly over the cape. For intermediate Bu, e.g., 0.1 &lt;Bu &lt;1, fluid parcels flow\n\nmore around the obstacle than over it. Flow separation occurs and small tip eddies\n\nstart to shed. The increasing of Bu shifts the system from a eddy-attached regime\n\n(where eddies are formed behind the cape and shed downstream) to a lee eddy regime\n\n(where small lee eddies are formed and grow behind the cape). For high Bu, e.g.,\n\nBu > 1, (strong stratification), tip eddies merge to form larger eddies in the lee of\n\nthe cape. In our results, we could see indeed the formation of tip eddies in coastline\n\ninflexion points, which is in accordance with the pattern obtained by the above authors,\n\nalthough we used a different coastline shape. The computed Bu indicates, according\n\nto the authors, we have a strong stratification system. We know that both rotation and\n\nstratification are actually important in Cape Frio region. However, we must have in\n\nmind we are using an idealized system here, where we do not have the presence of the\n\nIWBC. Nevertheless, we could not see the evaluation of the structures after 31 days,\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5.

THE PRIMITIVE EQUATIONS NUMERICAL MODEL 126\n\nand how the propagation would be given.\n\nWe cited, in Chapter 4, the study of Stern &amp; Whitehead [1990], where they evaluated\n\nthe role of variations in coastline curvature in the behavior of a jet passing around an\n\nindentation similar to Cape Frio scenario. According to the pattern obtained by the\n\nauthors, an abrupt angle would favor separation of the jet from the boundary, and a\n\nmushroom-like structure would form and set the path for the trailing jet. In the other\n\nhand, a smoother angle (they discussed the critical angle) would favor an attached jet\n\nthat eventually would form eddies. The scenario obtained here resembles this second\n\nregime obtained by these authors, since we could not see separation in any moment.\n\nFinally, it is important to highlight that our goals number 5 presented in Section\n\n1.2 were accomplished in the present chapter, e.g we examined the interaction of a\n\nbarotropically unstable meridional jet and the western boundary in a realistic topogra-\n\nphy scenario. We saw the formation of features that seemed to be triggered by lateral\n\nboundary perturbations (or variations). A bipolar feature was incipiently formed off\n\nCape Frio indentation. However, due to the short-run conducted here, and could not\n\nsee propagation and possible detachment of these structures and their interaction with\n\nthe current.\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this final chapter we present a brief overview of the study conducted here, compare\n\nimportant points obtained from each model results, point out unresolved important\n\nissues and suggest future work.\n\nIn summary, we presented observational evidences of the formation of vortex dipole\n\nstructures along the Brazilian continental margin south of Cape Frio (23?S). Informa-\n\ntion from the literature and a mere inspection of series of AVHRR images revealed the\n\nformation of paired eddies with opposite vorticity signs in each side of the BC nearby\n\nthe Cape. Downstream, a staggered series of smaller cyclones and anticyclones were\n\nfound forming what was called a vortex street by Pratt et al. [1991]. Additionally, the\n\nimages also depicted different phenomena not yet reported for the BC: typical instabil-\n\nity wave trains within Santos Bight (23?S-28?S). These trains seem to be very similar to\n\nthose described for the Gulf Stream by Xue &amp; Mellor [1993], upstream of the Charleston\n\nBump.\n\nThe kernel of this dissertation is, then, to unravel the dynamics of the vortex dipole\n\nand vortex street formation phenomena. In order to address the issue, we stated two\n\nworking hypotheses: (1) barotropic instability is the driving mechanism for the for-\n\nmation of dipoles and instability wave trains, and (2) changes in coastline orientation\n\ncan promote perturbations in the BC jet which trigger those instabilities. We tested the\n\ntwo hypotheses through the formulation, implementation and application of a suite of\n\nthree idealized models. We progressively added dynamical complexity to first isolate\n\nthe instability mechanism and, later in document, to explore the role of lateral bound-\n\n127\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS 128\n\nary changes in the flow. The first of these models dealt with an idealized southward-\n\nflowing, barotropically unstable jet in a QG contour dynamics model (Chapter 3); the\n\nsecond model consisted of exploring a continuous potential vorticity QG full numerical\n\nmodel of a jet flowing adjacent to western boundary that could be either meridional\n\nor curvy (Chapter 4). The first two models employed an equivalent-barotropic and\n\nbarotropic vertical structure, respectively. The third model employed consisted of a\n\nprimitive equation numerical model (Chapter 5), through which we relaxed the layer\n\napproximation constraint of the former two, as well as the QG approximation. We\n\nperformed simulations allowing the examination of a realistically shaped baroclinic jet\n\nflowing over a realistic continental margin.\n\nIn Chapter 3, we formulated a piecewise-constant PV, contour dynamics model that\n\nresembled both Pratt et al. [1991] and Schmidt [2004], but considered three contours (or\n\nthree PV fronts) and the presence of the western boundary. The choice of the three\n\nfronts is due to the fact that such configuration is the minimal PV structure to support\n\na vortex dipole structure to be formed in each side of the boundary jet. We also did\n\nnot opt for a convention span of the CD model parameter. Instead, we attempted to\n\ndo a match using one of the few scarce observations of the BC jet not meandering,\n\nand hence, assumed to be possibly closer to a (yet unknown) steady state. In the ex-\n\nperiments conducted, we could reproduce the formation of paired eddies upstream\n\n(dipole) and a sequence of opposing-sign eddies downstream, which already resem-\n\nbled the observational evidences presented in Chapter 1. Therefore, we verified that\n\nbarotropic instability can indeed generate bipolar vortical features in jets with a PV\n\nconfiguration similar to that of the Brazil Current.\n\nIn Chapter 4, we relaxed the piecewise constant PV field constraint of the CD\n\nmethod, and advanced the methodology regarding the PV field characteristics. The\n\nexperiments employing a barotropic jet possessing a continuous PV structure pro-\n\nduced richer dynamics occurring in the model domain. We could observe not only\n\nthat barotropic instability can generate bipolar structures, but also that the change in\n\nthe coastline orientation can indeed trigger perturbations in the boundary current. By\n\nchanging the PV structure of the jet as well as the coastline configuration we were not\n\nonly able to simulate the dipole/vortex street formation but also the instability wave\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS 129\n\ntrains.\n\nIn Chapter 5, we implemented the ROMS model using feature models [Gangopad-\n\nhyay et al., 2003] as initial conditions. However, the feature models employed in our\n\nstudy were built to resemble the linear instability properties of the jets from Chapter 3.\n\nWe used real topography of the study area and, therefore, added more dynamical com-\n\nplexity to our physical system. Again, we could see that both barotropic instability and\n\ntopographic variations can induce the formation of bipolar structures. Even this more\n\ncomplex scenario kept the pattern of the two previous chapters regarding formation of\n\nstructures. The dipole formed satisfactorily reproduced the velocity structure obtained\n\nby Pereira [2009] for the DEPROAS V cruise. Hence, our hypotheses were affirmatively\n\nverified for the present work.\n\nTheory involving dynamics of current separation may be related to the scenario of\n\na curvy coastline studied here. For instance, Marshall &amp; Tansley [2001], Castelao &amp; Barth\n\n[2006], Stern &amp; Whitehead [1990] tried to find parameter that could limit regimes of flow\n\nseparation and flow attachment. Doglioli et al. [2004] mentioned that eddy generation\n\nis connected to the ubiquitous phenomenon of current separation occurring in flows in\n\npresence of obstacles. However, as a general consensus, Cessi &amp; Ierley [1993] mentioned\n\nthat viscous shear instability is proposed as a primary mechanism for generating time-\n\ndependent eddies at western boundary. Because of the complex nonlinear nature of the\n\nphenomenon, a quantitative prediction of eddy characteristics as a function of environ-\n\nmental parameters is hard to achieve. Many different mechanisms, characterized by\n\ndifferent non-dimensional parameters, play an important role, including bottom fric-\n\ntion processes, vertical and horizontal mixing, and stratification [Doglioli et al., 2004].\n\nIn this sense, Flierl [1999] showed that baroclinic processes play a significant role in the\n\ngrowth of meanders, while upper-layer interactions drive the final pinch-off of eddies.\n\nHere we isolated the effect of the horizontal velocity shear, and consequently PV\n\nstructure, to address the role of barotropic instability being the driving mechanism\n\nfor the vortex dipole formation, as well as the vortex street and the instability wave\n\ntrains. The topographic changes provide sites for perturbing the jet and letting the\n\nphenomena to develop. Certainly, other factors (such as the mentioned above) may\n\nplay important role in the formation of eddies and dipoles, and may determine differ-\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS 130\n\nent regimes.\n\nAs future work, we suggest the inclusion of the vertical shear effect in order to see\n\nthe response of the jet regarding dipole formation and its downstream evolution. To\n\ncomplement our study, it would be important to evaluate other dynamical aspects of\n\nthe results, such as trying to fit solutions for the results obtained (Rossby wave solu-\n\ntions, pulse-train solutions and so on). Particularly, using topographic Rossby wave\n\nforcing would be interesting to compare to the processes of warm outbreaks in the GS.\n\nThe inclusion of the ? effect should give important changes in the results. Moreover,\n\nsimulations of the interaction of the jet with a cyclone could give important dynami-\n\ncal insights regarding the BC interacting with the Cape Frio eddies. And simulations\n\nof the interaction of the jet with an anticyclone could be carried assuming the anti-\n\ncyclones of Agulhas rings reach the western boundary of the South Atlantic and also\n\ninteract with the BC.\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\nBell, G.
