Floodplains of tropical\nrivers differ from the river continuum where communities\nalong the river are distributed so as to harmonize with their\nfeeding habitats to utilize the transported material.

Therefore, unlike the behavior predicted by the\nriver continuum concept, in which communities are found\norganized along the longitudinal axis so as to maximize the\ntransport of materials and energy from a high to low gradient,\nflooding events cause large changes in all of the hydrographic\nbasin of rivers with floodplains (JUNK et al. 1989).

The rotifer community in Lago Amap\u00e1 (abandoned meander lake of the Rio\nAcre floodplain) was investigated with respect to seasonal changes. Sampling was performed at three collection\nstations, generally weekly, during the dry season between May 8, 1997 and October 31, 1997, and during the rainy\nseason between January 2, 1998 and February 24, 1998. The density and composition of rotifer species (48 taxons\nof rotifers) were determined, and their diversity and abundance were observed to be greater, respectively, at\nhigh-water and low-water. Anova was performed, by means of the F test, to test for seasonal differences in\nenvironmental variables and rotifers, showing that there was a highly statistically significant difference for pH\nand transparency (p &lt;0.01). Pearson\u2019s correlation was used to show that rotifer numbers during the low-water\nphase correlated negatively with electrical conductivity (r = -0.8824, p &lt;0.05) and during the high-water phase\ncorrelated negatively with depth (r = -0.7513, p &lt;0.05). Seasonal changes, caused by an increase in water levels\nand the low diversification of niches, influenced the composition and abundance of the animal group studied.\nKEY WORDS.

A comunidade de rot\u00edferos do Lago Amap\u00e1 (meandro abandonado da plan\u00edcie de inunda\u00e7\u00e3o do Rio\nAcre) foi investigada sazonalmente. As amostragens foram realizadas semanalmente em tr\u00eas esta\u00e7\u00f5es de coletas,\nem dois per\u00edodos: esta\u00e7\u00e3o seca entre 08/V/1997 e 31/X/1997 e esta\u00e7\u00e3o chuvosa, entre 02/I/1998 e 24/II/1998.\nA densidade e composi\u00e7\u00e3o de rot\u00edferos (48 t\u00e1xons de rot\u00edferos) foram determinadas. A diversidade e abund\u00e2ncia\nforam caracterizadas por serem maiores, respectivamente, nas \u00e1guas altas e \u00e1guas baixas.

Hardy\n\nRevista Brasileira de Zoologia 21 (2): 233\u2013241, junho 2004\n\nfore, to understand lake metabolism is it necessary to evaluate\nthe biomass and the role of zooplankton in the ecosystem.\n\nThe ideal niche is defined by the tolerance levels of an\norganism while the observed niche is that subset of tolerable\nconditions actually occupied by the organism. Extreme abiotic\nor biotic stress can cause local extirpation of a population \u2013 the\nspecies becomes rare or even disappears from a place where it\nonce occurred. Predators or competitors may prevent the spe-\ncies from effectively colonizing a habitat where abiotic condi-\ntions might otherwise allow it to survive and flourish. The or-\nder of possible answers leads to greater insight into the impor-\ntance of abiotic and biotic constraints. The boundaries of pos-\nsibility are defined first by tolerances, then by minimum growth\nand finally by successful reproduction (KITCHELL 1998). Thus,\nhydrological connectivity influences biodiversity (AMOROS 2001).\n\nRotifers are very important freshwater plankton and they\ncover the ecologic niche of the the small filter feeders. The length\nof their life cycle is two weeks or less (MARGALEF 1983), so their\nstudy should involve samplings over a short period of time.\n\nThe ecological and taxonomic knowledge of zooplank-\nton in continental waters is important for understanding the\nfunctioning of the aquatic ecosystem. Zooplankton in tropical\nregions present a diversity of species of little known distribu-\ntion in lakes, mainly those from abandoned meanders. Ecosys-\ntems of this nature harbor species that they possess since ample\ndistribution until endemic, in accordance with the extent of\necological niches propitiated by environmental conditions in-\nfluenced by hydrographic basins. Rotifers are organisms that\nhave asexual and sexual phases, representing one of the main\nplankton components in continental water communities. This\ngroup shows a typical geographic distribution in basins, influ-\nenced by its opportunistic form of occupation. This unique\nmanner of occupying diverse niches of continental water eco-\nsystems is influenced by the interaction of physical, chemical\nand biological parameters. These factors determine the com-\nplexity that results in the presence of different species and zoop-\nlankton groups, verified from studies of community structure.\n\nOne of the continental water systems commonly found\nin South America, characterized by marked seasonal changes\ncaused by fluctuations of the water level, are the floodplains.\nThey have been studied in Brazil, especially with regard to the\ncomposition and ecology of zooplankton: GREEN (1972) in the\nPantanal Matogrossense, LANSAC-T\u00d4HA et al. (1992, 1993),\nBONECKER et al. (1994, 1996), and BONECKER &amp; LANSAC-T\u00d4HA (1996).\nThe zooplanktonic communities that inhabit different envi-\nronments present in floodplains, show a standard composi-\ntion and abundance, depending on the physical, chemical and\nbiological conditions of the environment. Several studies of\ncommunity structure in the Amazonian basin have examined\nthese aspects, most noteworthy being: CARVALHO (1983), KOSTE\n&amp; ROBERTSON (1983), HARDY et al. (1984), ROBERTSON &amp; HARDY\n(1984), SANTOS-SILVA et al. (1989), BOZELLI (1992, 1994), and\nWAICHMAN et al. (2002).\n\nThere have been few studies of zooplankton in lakes of\nabandoned meanders, common in the state of Acre (SENDACZ &amp;\nMELO-COSTA 1991, KEPPELER &amp; HARDY 2002). Therefore, the aims\nof the present work were (I) to determine the difference in the\nabundance and composition of Rotifera, in the major phases\nof the hydrologic cycle and (II) to correlate some physical,\nchemical and biological parameters with this composition.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nLago Amap\u00e1 is a lake belonging to the hydrographic ba-\nsin of the Rio Acre, to which it is permanently linked, and is\nthus considered a whitewater lake according to SIOLI (1968).\nLago Amap\u00e1 is situated in the municipality of Rio Branco with\nthe geographic coordinates 10\u00b002\u201936\u201dS and 67\u00b050\u201924\u201dW (see\nfigure 1 in KEPPELER &amp; HARDY 2004). The lakes are surrounded by\nforest, which is inundated during high water, and as a conse-\nquence, there is a great input of organic matter from the forest\ninto the lake.\n\nAccording to SALATI et al. (1978), the hydrologic complex\nof the Amazon basin, is formed by thousands of small rivers\nand has probably been in dynamic equilibrium, together with\nthe exuberant forest, for millennia. The lakes studied are situ-\nated south of the equator, beyond parallel 65\u00b0W, and receive a\nminimum amount of precipitation in June/July. However,\nwhitewater streams that are in Brazilian Amazonia are very evi-\ndent in the State of Acre in South Western Amazonia (SIOLI 1984).\n\nThe data on the biotic and abiotic parameters were col-\nlected at the lake generally at weekly intervals (except in Octo-\nber), during two periods comprising the low-water phase (dry\nseason) between May 8, 1997 and October 30, 1997 and the\nhigh-water phase (rainy season) between January 2, 1998 and\nFebruary 24, 1998. Three stations were selected: station I \u2013 a\nregion located close to a channel that connects Lago Amap\u00e1\nwith the Rio Acre; station II \u2013 an approximately central region\nof the lake; and station III; the terminal region of the lake.\n\nTo carry out a quantitative analysis of the zooplankton,\nthe organisms were collected with a Van Dorn sampling bottle,\nusing a conical net (55 \u00b5m mesh) to filter 5 liters of water at\ndifferent depths. The samples were preserved in a solution of\n4% formaldehyde. The samplings were counted in Sedgwick-\nRafter chambers (1mL) according to APHA (1992).\n\nThe determination of the physical, chemical and bio-\nlogical parameters, that is, water temperature (\u00b0C), transpar-\nency and depth of the water column (m), electrical conductiv-\nity (\u00b5S.cm-1), and dissolved oxygen (mg.L-1), was according to\nGOLTERMAN et al. (1978), and included a modification of the\nassay for dissolved oxygen using sodium azide (GOLTERMAN et\nal. 1969).\n\nData were standardized (except pH) by logarithmic trans-\nformation (log).The degree of significance of all values for the\nstudied of Rotifera and environmental variables among low\nwater period and high water period was calculated with Analy-\n\n\n\n0\n5\n\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n\n08\n/m\n\nai\n\n22\n/m\n\nai\n\n05\n/ju\n\nn\n\n19\n/ju\n\nn\n\n02\n/ju\n\nl\n\n05\n/ja\n\nn\n\n19\n/ja\n\nn\n\n02\n/f\n\nev\n\n16\n/f\n\nev\n\nDates\n\nN\num\n\nbe\nr \n\nof\n R\n\not\nif\n\ner\na\n\nsp\nec\n\nie\ns\n\n0\n100000\n200000\n300000\n400000\n500000\n\nR\not\n\nif\ner\n\na \nD\n\nen\nsi\n\nty\n (I\n\nnd\n/m\n\n3\n\nRotifera number s pecies Density Rotifera\n\n235Abundance and composition of Rotifera in an abandoned meander lake...\n\nRevista Brasileira de Zoologia 21 (2): 233\u2013241, junho 2004\n\nsis of Variance (ANOVA). Assumptions for ANOVA were veri-\nfied. The tukey Test was used for means comparison using SAS\nsystem (vs. 5, SAS 1998). The degree of significance of all values\nfor the studied variables among Rotifera and abiotic variables\nwas established by Pearson\u2019s coefficient of variation. Simple\nLinear Regression Analysis was used.\n\nRESULTS\n\nEnvironmental and biological variables were averaged\nfor the top and middle layers, where zooplankton are gener-\nally concentrated. The means and variations are listed in table\nI. The composition of Rotifera included 48 taxons, of which\n20 represented new registers for the floodplain of the Rio Acre\n(Tab. II).\n\nSome species of Rotifera have been showen to be com-\nmon. Included in collections during the low-water phase pe-\nriod were the following: Asplanchna sieboldi (Leydig, 1854);\nBrachionus caudatus Barrois &amp; Daday, 1884; Brachionus falcatus\nZacharias, 1898; Epiphanes macrourus (Barrois &amp; Daday, 1894),\nFilinia opoliensis (Zacharias, 1898); Keratella cochlearis Gosse,\n1851, and Polyarthra vulgaris Carlin, 1943. In the high-water\nphase, the species that predominated were Brachionus\ncalicyflorus Pallas, 1766, Brachionus calicyflorus anuraeformis\n(Brehm, 1909), Filinia terminalis Plate, 1886, Keratella cochlearis\nhispida Lauterborn, 1900, Thrichocerca similis Plate, 1886 and\nPolyarthra vulgaris Carlin, 1943. Numerical density and num-\nber of Rotifera of the samples are shown in figure 1 for the\nthree collection stations.\n\nThe rotifers showed a higher abundance in the low-wa-\nter phase, especially the following species: Asplanchna brightwelli\nGosse, 1850; Asplanchna sieboldi (Leydig, 1854); Brachionus\ncalicyflorus anuraeformis, Filinia longiseta (Ehrenberg, 1834);\nFilinia terminalis (Ehrenberg, 1834), Filinia opoliensis (Zacharias,\n1898), Keratella cochlearis Plate, 1886, and Keratella cochlearis\nhispida Lauterborn, 1900 (Tab. III).\n\nFigures 2 and 3 show the Pearson correlations that were\nsignificant (p &lt;0.05) between the environmental variables and\ndensity of the rotifers. Both correlations were negative. There\nwas a correlation with electrical conductivity (r = \u20130.8824;\np &lt;0.05) in the low-water phase, while this group showed a\ncorrelation with depth (r = \u20130.7513; p &lt;0.05) in the high-wa-\nter phase. Therefore, rotifer abundance was influenced by lim-\nnological factors.\n\nVariance analysis and comparison of means of the roti-\nfer and environmental variables in the low-water phase/1997\nand water-high phase/1998 are in table IV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHabitat selection is one of the most poorly understood\necological processes. The question is the following: What ele-\nments of the habitat do animals recognize as relevant? We de-\nfine a habitat as any part of the biosphere where a particular\n\nspecies can live, either temporarily or permanently. Habitat\nselection is a process that operates at the level of the individual\nanimal (KREBS 2001). The hydrologic complex that is the Ama-\nzon basin is formed by thousands of small rivers and probably\nhas been, together with the exuberant forest, in dynamic equi-\nlibrium (SALATI et al. 1978). Mature (old) rivers that flow across\nplains and that have already reached their base level (limit\nbelow which erosion by flowing waters cannot occur) have a\n\nFigure 1.

Hardy\n\nRevista Brasileira de Zoologia 21 (2): 233\u2013241, junho 2004\n\nsinuous appearance. The snaking stretches of these rivers are\ncalled meanders. In general, a large number of lakes are found\nalong side of meander rivers. These lakes are formed by the\nisolation of meanders through processes of erosion and sedi-\nmentation of the banks. The lakes thus formed are so-called\nhorseshoe, or meander lakes and are probably the most com-\nmon lakes in Brazil. They are also called oxbow lakes and are\nnumerous in the Amazonian region, because this region has\nfew elevations and a large number of meandering rivers, thereby\noffering conditions favoring the formation of inumerous horse-\nshoe lakes. Also, components of the landscape surrounding a\nlake, stream or river can have a strong influence on water qual-\nity. Elements of the landscape may serve as sources, sinks, or\ntransformers for nutrients. Moreover, biotic factors such as\nvegetation cover, which play a decisive role in the decomposi-\ntion of organic litter, determine the types of running waters in\nAmazonia (SIOLI 1984, ESTEVES 1998, TURNER 1998).\n\nLago Amap\u00e1 is one of these environments, which receives\nwater from the Rio Acre during some months of the year. In\nLago Amap\u00e1, as the hydrographic level increased with the en-\ntrance of water from the Rio Acre, as of January 19, 1998, only\na few rotifer species appeared, such as Brachionus calicyflorus\n\nanuraeformis, Lecane leontina, Lecane ludwigi. Despite the changes\ncaused by the increase in hydrographic levels, these were mod-\nest in relation to ecosystems of other floodplains, possibly ex-\nplained by the meander form of the lake in study. However,\nsome studies of floodplains have attributed the increase in\nzooplanktonic diversity to an increase in the hydrographic lev-\nels (HARDY 1980, KOSTE &amp; ROBERTSON 1983, HARDY et al. 1984,\nCORRALES DE JACOBO &amp; FRUTOS 1985, BONECKER et al. 1994, BONECKER\n&amp; LANSAC-T\u00d4HA 1994). Probably, lakes formed from meanders\nfavor the deposit of large amounts of clay, derived from ero-\nsion and sedimentation along the banks of the lake. These lakes\nwould differ from other existing lakes in the floodplain of the\nAmazonian Basin and the Paran\u00e1, influencing then the exist-\ning diversity in this environment. The erosion mechanisms,\nespecially at the time of the full one, modify the pH of the\nwater making it acid and hindering the development of cer-\ntain species.

The process\nof soil erosion along the banks made it difficult for the estab-\nlishment of littoral species. However the shore-inhabiting\nLecanideae family had the the largest number of representa-\ntives. The family most frequently observed in our study was\nBrachionidae, followed by the Lecanidae family which is pre-\ndominant in typically tropical environments. These families\nhad also been found to be dominant in the studies of CARVALHO\n(1983). Similarly, they were found to be abundant in aquatic\nenvironments of the Amaz\u00f4nia.\n\nIn relation to the composition of the zooplanktonic com-\nmunity, the number of taxons (48) found in Lago Amap\u00e1 can\nbe related to the diversification of niches present in each phase\nof the hydrologic cycle, and to the absence of aquatic plants.\nThis number is low compared to the diversity reported for other\nbasins and other floodplain lakes. ROBERTSON &amp; HARDY (1984),\nreporting on Amazonian data, estimated 250 species of roti-\n\nfers. According to ROCHA et al. (1994) the Amazonian basin has\na greater diversity of zooplankton (Rotifera + Cladocera +\nCopepoda), with 268 Rotifera, than do the basins of the\nParaguai, Paran\u00e1 and S\u00e3o Francisco. The high number of tax-\nons registered for the rotifers (48), compares with the date of\nSENDACZ &amp; MELO-COSTA (1991), who described the presence of\nCladocera and Copepoda also in this lake and Lago Novo\nAndir\u00e1, in relation to the other groups of zooplankton in the\nneotropical region. This is also in line with that observed by\nvarious authors who have studied the floodplains of Amazonia\n(HARDY 1980, KOSTE &amp; ROBERTSON 1983, HARDY et al. 1984, BOZELLI\n1992, KOSTE &amp; ROBERTSON 1998) and other floodplains (JOSE DE\nPAGGI 1981, CORRALES DE JACOBO &amp; FRUTOS 1985). Still in accor-\ndance with this last author, the high number of taxons regis-\ntered for rotifers in floodplains is supported by, among other\nfactors, the heterogeneity of environments present. Therefore,\nthis lake was not favorable due to this factor, accounting for\n\nTable IV.

The larger abundance of\nrotifers during the low-water period demonstrated that the fluc-\ntuation in water level had influenced this group more. This\nfactor also was observed by HARDY (1980) and LANSAC-T\u00d4HA et al.\n(1993), possibly due to increased food availability. Therefore,\ndilution caused by high water affects food availability. Accord-\ning to KITCHELL (1998), food is a prime factor for non-photo-\nsynthetic organisms.\n\nThere was a low degree of rotifer diversity in the envi-\nronment studied. The presence and success of an organism or\ngroup of organisms depend on a combination of conditions.\nAny condition that approximates or exceeds the limits of tol-\nerance is said to be a limiting condition or limiting factor.\nCombining the idea of the minimum and the concept of the\ntolerance limits it is arrived the most general and useful con-\ncept of the limiting factors. Thus, organisms are controled in\nnature by (1) the quantity and variability of materials for which\nthere are minimum requirements, and also critical physical\nfactors, and (2) the tolerance limits of the organisms them-\nselves to these and other components of the environment. Of\nthe total number of species in a trophic component, or in a\ncommunity taken as a whole, a relatively small percentage is\nas a rule abundant (represented by large numbers of individu-\nals, a large biomass or productivity, or any other indication of\nimpact, and a large percentage are rare (with small impact val-\nues). While only a few common and dominant species con-\ntribute largely to the energy flow in each trophic group, it is\nthe large number of rare species that determines essentially\nspecies diversity at trophic levels of communities taken as a\nwhole. The ratios between the number of species and the im-\npact values (numbers, biomass, productivity, and so forth) for\nthe individuals are designated by species diversity indices. The\ndiversity of species tends to be small in ecosystems controled\nphysically (that is, subjected to strong, physical and chemical\nlimiting factors) and high in ecosystems controled biologically.\nCommunities in stable environments, such as tropical\nrainforests, have a greater species diversity than communities\nsubjected to perturbations or cycles by human or naturals\ncauses. Tropical waters of little depth is one factor that dimin-\nishes diversity in a habitat (ODUM 2001). The lake studied had\na maximum depth of 3.4 m, contributing one more factor lim-\niting diversity. In addition to data on diversity, the present\nstudy also demonstrated that the abundance of rotifers corre-\nlated negatively with depth.\n\nA significant difference between the means was observed\nonly using the F test, when examining the seasonality for trans-\nparency and pH. The results for temperature, electric conduc-\ntivity and dissolved oxygen versus the presence of Rotifera\ndemonstrated a low degree of seasonal variation in this study\nin contrast to that reported by CAMARGO &amp; ESTEVES (1995). These\nauthors found that in the oxbow lake of Rio Mogi-Gua\u00e7u in\nS\u00e3o Paulo, a high degree of seasonal variation in the results for\nthese parameters as a result of the pulse of flooding. However,\n\nSCHMIDT (1973) also did not observe great seasonal variations,\nwhen studying such parameters in Lago Castanho in Central\nAmazonia. Temperature remained practically constant during\nthe entire period of the hydrologic cycle, according to SIOLI\n(1984), water temperature, running in an equatorial lowland\nwhere temperature fluctuations are minimal, the waters of the\nAmazon have a surprisingly constant temperature, and consti-\ntute the most thermally stable waters on earth. THOMAZ et al.\n(1997) also observed a constant water temperature in the flood-\nplain of the Rio Paran\u00e1, which was characterized by small secu-\nlar oscillations, except for the occurrence of a small increase in\nthe high-water phase. Some taxons appeared in Lago Amap\u00e1\nat basic or neutral pH and relatively low dissolved oxygen lev-\nels, such as Platyas quadricornis, Lepadella ovalis, Trichocerca\nsimilis and Testudinella patina. Therefore, these factors are not\nconsidered limiting for these species in the lake studied. How-\never, according to KITCHELL (1998), just as oxygen concentra-\ntion often is an important constraint for aquatic organisms,\nespecially animails.\n\nLago Amap\u00e1 is also being subjected to human activiy\nresulting from pollution. Human changes in land use have\ngreatly increased the amounts of nutrients and silt that enter\nlakes. Most increases in nutrient flow can be linked to urban\nrun-off through storm water systems, effluent from sewage\ntreatment plants, failing septic systems, agricultural run-off,\ndeforestation, and nutrient-rich waste waters from industries\nsuch as food processing. The distribution of many species can\nbe affected by human-mediated changes in habitats. Human\nchanges to landscapes and environments may make some habi-\ntat selection maladaptative (PERRY &amp; VANDERKLEIN 1996, KREBS\n2001), interfering with the diversity of species.\n\nAsplanchna was an abundant genus in Lago Amap\u00e1. Ac-\ncording to MARGALEF (1983), it is a predador organism, ingest-\ning large and mobile algae, as well as other smaller zooplank-\ntonic organisms. The degree of predation affects greatly the\ndiversity of populations or of prey. A moderate predation of-\nten reduces the density of dominant species, thereby provid-\ning less competitive species increased opportunities to utilize\nspace and resources. The presence of predators may limit the\ngeographic distribution of many species. Predator limitations\non prey distribution often operate on a local scale. Prey rarely\nlimit the distribution of their predators (ODUM 2001, KREBS\n2001). The establishment of these organisms in the lake stud-\nied was propitious, since the algae present in Lago Amap\u00e1 were\nmostly large ( > 15 \u00b5m), in addition to being abundant, and of\nthe filamentous type, for example the blue-green algae cyano-\nphyceae (KEPPELER et al. 1999a,b; KEPPELER &amp; HARDY 2002). Chloro-\nphyceae are common in Lago Amap\u00e1 (KEPPELER et al. 1999b),\nwhich favor the presence of species of the genus Brachionus,\nabundant in Lago Amap\u00e1. HU et al. (2002), who studied the\nrotifer Brachionus angularis, observed that there were very sig-\nnificant effects of food concentrations on population growth\nrate, body size and egg size in this species when Chlorella pyrenoi-\n\n\n\n240 E.

(2001) also\nshowed that different densities of live and dead Chlorella vul-\ngaris affected the population growth of the rotifers Brachionus\ncalyciflorus and Brachionus patulus (Platyonus patulus).\n\nThe communities in rigorous environments should vary\nin diversity in accordance with their relative abundance com-\nponent, while diversity in non rigorous environments (bio-\nlogically controled) should depend on the number of species.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe are grateful to Dr. Cl\u00e1udia Costa Bonecker, Suzana\nSendacz, and Pedro Gonz\u00e1lez Dominguez for their valuable\ncritique of this study and part of the Masters dissertation in\nEcology and Management of Natural Resources.
