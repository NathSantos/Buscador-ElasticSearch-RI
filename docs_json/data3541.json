Moreover, by oxidizing the \nHMF, the 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) can be obtained, which can replace the terephthalic \nacid (TA) (from petroleum) in the polymers production as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). \nThe replacement of TA with materials derived from renewable sources is of great interest from \nan environmental and sustainable point of view.\n\nKeywords: 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, dehydration, fructose, glucose, HMF\n\nIntroduction\n\nSince the end of the 20th century the interest in the \nuse of raw materials from renewable resources for the \nproduction of a variety of petrochemical intermediates \nhas been growing in order to develop the replacement of \npetroleum as a source of raw materials and energy. Such \ntechniques enabling the achievement of alternative sources \nwill gradually be available for industrial application, \ndepending on economic interests, social and availability \nof appropriate technologies.1-3 Several product classes are \npromising natural substitutes of petroleum derivatives, \nthe biomass being the first one obtained from renewable \nsources. Among all biomass, carbohydrates represent \nmore than 75%, therefore the interest to convert them into \nfine chemicals is increasing and could represent a real \nalternative to non renewable sources.4-7 \n\nCurrently the sustainable industrial conversion of \nbiomass still depends on the development of specific \ntechnologies involving processes for biomass conversion \nrelated to equipment for producing fuels, chemical \nproducts and energy.1,4,8,9 An example of this is the \nobtainment of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), see \nstructure in Figure 1, and furfural from cellulose or other \ncarbohydrates as glucose, fructose and starch. A lot of \nrenewable intermediates obtainable from biomass enable \nthe production of green polymers or are precursors for the \nproduction of fuel, diesel or jet fuel.10-13 \n\nT h e  c a t a l y t i c  o x i d a t i o n  o f  H M F  p r o d u c e s \n2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), a material that can \n\nO\n\nHHO\n\nO\n\nFigure 1. Structure of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF).\n\n\n\nMelo et al. 2379Vol. 25, No. 12, 2014\n\nsubstitute the terephthalic acid (TA) in PET production \nor isophthalic acids in the manufacture of polyamides, \npolyesters and polyurethanes. The replacement of TA by \nFDCA constitutes an important step for sustainable processes \ndevelopment, thus FDCA production could represent a huge \nmarket. Nowadays polyurethanes using FDCA are already \nmanufactured industrially for several applications.1,14-16\n\nThe synthesis of HMF, shown in Scheme 1, comprises \nmany problems, especially those associated with the \nformation of byproducts through parallel reactions. The \nformation of secondary products as levulinic acid (LA) \nand formic acid (FA) influence the overall efficiency of the \nprocess, as well as formation of humins polymers which \nis the main cause of low HMF yields reported in most of \nstudies available in this area.11,17,18\n\nHMF produced with low yield and the high cost \nof industrial production are the factors that limit its \navailability. Some processes described in the literature \nproduce HMF using acid catalysts for the conversion of \nfructose as substrate. However, the disadvantage in the \nuse of these catalysts is that secondary reactions usually \noccur, burdening the process by the loss of material and \nthe necessity of purifying the product. Moreover, HMF \ndecomposes under acidic conditions in water.19 \n\nWhen using glucose as substrate, the situation is more \ncritical due to the low HMF yield and the production of \nlarger amounts of byproducts. Using glucose implies the \nisomerization into fructose by selective methods, leading \nto an increase in yield of the desired final product.18 \n\nDifferent catalysts are employed for the synthesis of \nHMF, such as, ion exchange resins,20-22 minerals and organic \nacids,23-25 zeolites6,26 and oxides.27 These catalytic systems, \nbesides producing HMF with low yields and forming \nbyproducts, high temperatures and longer reaction times \nare usually required.28\n\nSolid acid catalysts such as SO4\n2\u2013/ZrO2-Al2O3 present \n\nstrong acidity and were used in the conversion of glucose and \n\nfructose to HMF yielding 47.6% and 68.2%, respectively \nin 4 h at 130 \u00baC. Nb2O5 catalyst (calcined at 400 \u00baC) was \neffective for the production of HMF due to its Lewis acid \nsites. This catalyst showed a total fructose conversion with \n86.2% HMF yield (2 h reaction at 120 \u00baC).27,29\n\nQi et al.20 studied the catalytic dehydration of fructose \ninto HMF using microwave heating and a solvent media \ncomposed by acetone-water, the catalyst being a strong acid \ncation exchange resin (Dowex 50wx8-100) that is insoluble \nin water. Yields of 73.4% for 5-HMF and a conversion of \n94% at 150 \u00baC were obtained. The resin showed a good \nstability at high temperatures enabling its reuse 5 times \nwithout observing catalytic activity decrease. \n\nAn efficient strategy for the direct production of HMF \nfrom glucose and cellulose (from ligninocellulose) was \nproposed using ionic liquids (ILs) based in imidazolium \nin the presence of CrCl3 by microwave radiations, yields \nbehind 60-90% were obtained. This reaction was considered \na significant advance in the use of ligninocellulose for the \nproduction of carbohydrates via a green process.30 The use \nILs, besides leading to satisfactory results, provides an \nenvironmental alternative process where volatile organic \nsolvents are substituted representing an attracted interest \nin different areas.31 \n\nHu et al. proposed a mechanism employing SnCl4 as \ncatalyst for the glucose to HMF conversion in IL, 1-ethyl-3-\nmethylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMI.BF4), where the \nSn+4 center interacts with a acyclic and five or six member \nring intermediates.32 Zhao et al.19 studied an alternative \nsystem, for which dehydration takes place more easily as \nthe metallic halides catalyst (CrCl2, CrCl3, FeCl2, FeCl3, \nCuCl, CuCl2, VCl3, MoCl3, PdCl2, PtCl2, PtCl4 or RuCl3) \nis dissolved in the IL. With this method HMF is obtained \nin high yields (63 to 83%) and secondary reactions are \nminimized (for example, levulinic acid formation is 0.08%). \nAmong the catalysts tested the highest HMF yield was \nachieved using CrCl2 which reaches values   around 70%.\n\n18 \n\nO\n\nHHO\n\nO\n\nSugars\n\n[Intermediate]\n\nInsoluble polymers\n\n(Humins)\n\nHMF ether\n\nLevolunic acid\n\nFormic acid\n\nScheme 1. Synthesis of HMF (adapted from reference 17).\n\n\n\nSynthesis of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural from Dehydration of Fructose And Glucose Using Ionic Liquids J. Braz. Chem. Soc.2380\n\nSidhpuria et al. used nanoparticles immobilized in ILs in \nthe dehydration of fructose obtaining 63% HMF yield.32,33\n\nAnother alternative is employing an IL as catalyst and \nsolvent. For example, the use of 1-H-3-methylimidazolium \nchloride (HMI.Cl) in the dehydration of fructose produced \nHMF with a yield of 92% after 45 minutes of reaction time. \nWhen this catalytic system was used with sucrose, a rapid \ncleavage of sucrose into fructose and glucose was observed. \nThe fructose was then transformed quickly into HMF with \nhigh yield and without the formation of byproducts and on \nthe other hand at the same time, only 3% of the glucose was \nconverted in HMF. The low transformation of glucose is \ndue the necessity of its previous isomerization into fructose \nbefore the dehydration reaction to produce HMF.34,35 \n\nFurans produced from carbohydrates have high \npotential for the synthesis of monomers and then polymeric \nmaterials based on renewable sources. They can be obtained \nby synthesis which provides high yields and low production \ncosts, but still should be investigated in order to optimize \nthe process. A prime example is the use of ILs based on \nimidazolium in dehydration processes sugar (fructose or \nglucose) with satisfactory results related to the selectivity \nthat can be improved in the case of the glucose and showed \nin this paper.36,37 \n\nThis study reports results of HMF synthesis from \ndehydration of fructose or glucose using imidazolium based \nILs as solvent and acid catalyst. \n\nExperimental\n\nSynthesis imidazolium based ionic liquids\n\n1-buthyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (C4MI.Cl),  \n1-methyl-3-octhylimidazolium chloride (C8MI.Cl), \n1-decyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (C10MI.Cl), \n1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (C12MI.Cl) and \n1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (C16MI.Cl) \nwere prepared to methods previously described (Figure 2 \n(n = 4-16)).38,39\n\nSynthesis of HMF\n\nAll the dehydration reaction experiments were \nperformed in a 50 mL flask equipped with magnetic stirrer. \n\nWere charged into the flask ionic liquid (4 g), fructose or \nglucose (0.4 g) and HCl acid (9%) (wt.%). The reaction \nsystem was placed in an oil bath adjusted to a range of \n80 to 120 \u00b0C (according IL melting point), during 8 or \n12 minutes.40 After reaction time, the reaction mixture \nwas analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography \n(HPLC) equipped with UV and refractive index detectors. \n\nThe HPLC measurements are conducted using a \nShimadzu LC-20AD with UV and refractive index detector. \nThe column Aminex HPX-87H (300 mm \u00d7 7.8 mm) is \nemployed to separate the reaction mixture.

The acid \ndissolved in the ILs is very selective in HMF formation \n(> 85%). The same performances are not observed when \ntests are performed with glucose as substrate. The poor \nconversion of glucose is linked to the need to isomerize \nglucose to fructose for subsequent dehydration, as described \nin literature.40,42 \n\nFigure 4 and 5 repeat data of Table 1 evidencing the \neffect of the alkyl chain lengh of the ILs in dehydration of \nfrutose and glucose respectively. The modification of ILs \nnature leads to considerable difference in selectivity and \nyield data for fructose reaction when the reaction time is \n12 minutes, but not for 8 minutes reaction time (Figure 4). \nThis results can indicate that with a higher reaction time \ndecomposition of HMF occurs and ILs with a longer alkyl \nchain avoid the formation of byproducts (compare in \nTable 1, HMF selectivity in reaction 2 with reactions 6, 10 \nand 14). About the glucose reaction (Figure 5), conversion \nis observed only when C12MI.Cl and C16MI.Cl are employed \nand attains high value (ca. 80%), but the corresponding \nHMF selectivities and yields remain low (&lt;50%). \n\nRelating to fructose as substrate, when using C4MI.\nCl at 80 \u00b0C, after 8 minutes, the yield is 91% (Table 1, \nreaction 1) and is reduced to 70% (Table 1, reaction 2)  \n\nafter 12 minutes of reaction time. This result indicates \nthat the reaction is completed rapidly and that HMF \ndecomposition occurs subsequently generating byproducts \nand decreasing the yield. In this IL (C4MI.Cl), HMF \nis not formed by dehydration of glucose (Table 1, \nreactions 3 and 4). The same occurs when C8MI.Cl \n(Table 1, reactions 7 and 8) and C10MI.Cl (Table 1, \nreactions 11 and 12) are employed.\n\nTable 1.

Effect of ILs in the dehydration of fructose.\n\n\n\nSynthesis of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural from Dehydration of Fructose And Glucose Using Ionic Liquids J. Braz. Chem. Soc.2382\n\nWhen C12MI.Cl is used in the fructose dehydration, \n(Table 1, reactions 13 and 14) the yield increases from 89% \nto 96% corresponding to 8 and 12 minutes respectively, \nindicating that after 8 minutes the reaction was not finished. \nFor glucose (Table 1, reactions 15 and 16), the increase \nof the time reaction also leads to increasing the yield, but \nthis one remains low (34%). This low yield obtained for \nglucose is not improved by the use of C16MI.Cl (Table 1, \nreactions 19 and 20). These low yields related to glucose \nindicate that its isomerization in this environment does not \noccur, probably due to the stability of its ring structure.33 \n\nResults of reactions 17 and 18 in Table 1, where \nfructose and C16MI.Cl are used, show that the change of \nthe reaction time from 8 to 12 minutes does not affect the \ncatalytic properties evidencing that no decomposition of \nHMF occurs as no byproducts are observed. \n\nThe set of these results show that, independently of \nIL used in this study, high HMF yields are obtained from \ndehydration of fructose in a relatively short reaction time \n(8 minutes). These results corroborate those described in \nthe literature.40,42 \n\nScheme 2 shows a proposal for mechanism dehydration \nof fructose catalyzed by acid such as the systems developed \nin this work. Antal43 and Newth44 suggest that the formation \nof HMF easily occurs from fructose by cyclic intermediate \nenol, 2,5-anhydro-D-mannose, formed in tautomerization \nstep.42 In this mechanism dehydration of fructose is initiated \nby protonation of the most basic hydroxyl group of the \nmolecule that directly attached to the ring in a position \n\nalpha to the oxygen. The protonated form leading to \nspontaneous dehydration generates the intermediate enol \nthat rearranges and then loses another water molecule, \nfollowed by deprotonation regenerating the catalyst and \neliminating HMF.\n\nIt isn\u2019t surprising that the IL/HCl system catalyzed \nthe dehydration of frutose due to the high acidity of the \nmedium, as mechanism proposed, but also ensures the \nphase separation, in particular in the case of BMI.Cl IL, due \nto the lipophilic character coming from the chain length of \nthe imidazolium ring. Balance of these different properties \nprovides the best systems for avoiding decomposition of \nHMF from frutose and the conversion of glucose. In this \n\nFigure 5. Effect of ILs in the dehydration of glucose.\n\nScheme 2. Mechanism of fructose dehydration.\n\n\n\nMelo et al. 2383Vol. 25, No. 12, 2014\n\ncase ILs C12MI.Cl and C16MI.Cl correspond to the best \nsystems. \n\nConclusions\n\nThis work shows that the catalyst system used, CnMI.\nCl (n = 4, 8, 10, 12 and 16) and HCl is efficient to produce \nHMF from fructose with yields higher than 90%. This did \nnot occur when glucose is used as starting material, showing \nthat this catalyst system has a low capacity to isomerize \nglucose to fructose, substance which would subsequently \nbe dehydrated to obtain HMF. ILs C12MI.Cl and C16MI.\nCl were the most effective for formation of HMF from \nglucose. Further studies of other catalytic systems are being \nconducted with the aim of improving the HMF yields when \nglucose is used as substrate.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nSupplementary data are available free of charge at  \nhttp://jbcs.sbq.org.br as PDF file.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by grants from the Finep and \nBraskem.\n\nThe authors dedicate this work to Roberto Fernando \nde Souza.
