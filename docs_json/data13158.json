DC., Asteraceae, \nvegetal specie known as marcela or macela, have a \nwide range of therapeutic uses in the south of Brazil, \n\nUruguay, Argentina and Paraguay as anti-inflammatory, \nantispasmodic, digestive, sedative, carminative, among \nothers (Sim\u00f5es et al., 1998). Although the popular use has \nbeen traditionally done by oral intake of inflorescences \ninfusions, for industrial application the development of \n\n\n\n804\nRev. Bras. Farmacogn. \nBraz. J. Pharmacogn. \n20(5): Out./Nov. 2010 \n\nAchyrocline satureioides (Lam.) DC., Asteraceae: development of granules from spray dried powder\n\nspray dried powders have been studied (Senna et al., 1997; \nTeixeira, 1996) in order to overcome the main limitation \nof liquid extracts, its low stability. The Achyrocline \nsatureioides spray dried powders have presented good \nstability against heat and light (Holzschuh et al., 2007). \nHowever, the poor properties of flow and compactability \nof the powders, mainly due to the small particle size, low \ndensity, wide range of granulometric distribution, and \nhigh hygroscopy have led to important limitations in the \ndevelopment of derivative solid pharmaceutical dosage \nforms.\n In an attempt to overcome such limitations, the \npresent work was designed to investigate the technological \nfeasibility of granules from the spray dried powder. For \nthis, the spray dried powder was produced on a semi-\nindustrial scale and characterized regarding its properties of \nflow and compactability, comparing these properties with \nthose presented by the corresponding granules. The main \npolyphenols, quercetin, luteolin, and 3-O-methylquercetin \nwere used as reference in the chemical control of the \nprocess.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nPreparation of the spray dried powder (SDP)\n\n The SDP of the A. satureioides (Lam.) DC., \nAsteraceae, was prepared by maceration of inflorescences \ninto a 40% ethanol/water solution in the proportion of \nplant:solvent of 5.2% (w/v). The corresponding extractive \nsolution containing 1.03\u00b10.01% (w/v) of dry residue was \nemployed to prepare the SDP. The SDP was prepared \naccording to the method previously described by Bassani \nand cols. (PI 103468-5, Bassani et al., 2001) and have in \nits composition colloidal silicon dioxide and polysorbate \n80 in a 1:1 ratio in the final product. Briefly, the spray \ndrying process was carried out on a semi-industrial scale in \na Minor Production Spray Dryer Plant equipment (NIRO), \nusing the following conditions: feed flow, 160 mL/min; \ninlet air temperature, 175 \u00baC; outlet air temperature, 100 \n\u00baC, and rotational atomizer speed, 11.000 rpm.\n\nDry granulation of SDP\n\nBlending of the powders\n\n Two blends of powder (F1 or F2) were prepared \nthrough the mixture of SDP with excipients in a cubic-like \nmixer, at 36 rpm, attached to a multiuse motor (Erweka AR \n400). The composition of these formulations is presented \nin the Table 1. For F2 preparation, the SDP and the filler \nmaterial (microcrystalline cellulose) were mixed in a \ncubical mixer, for 15 min, with posterior addition of the \nlubricant (magnesium stearate) and the flow regulator \n(colloidal silicon dioxide), then continuing the operation \nfor 5 more min. The F1 formulation was obtained by \n\nmixture the SDP and the lubricant for a period of 5 min. \nMixtures of 325 g each formulation were prepared.\n\nPreparation of the slugs\n\n Slugs of 0.7 g were obtained through direct \ncompression of F1 or F2 formulations in a single punch \ncompression machine (Korsch EK0), equipped with a \nfeeder and simple, circular, faceted punch of 15 mm in \ndiameter. The compression machine was regulated by \nlowering the lower punch by 6 mm and by penetrating the \nupper punch by 4 mm. The compression of the formulation \nwas carried out through manual operation of the machine.\n\nPreparation of the granules (SDG)\n\n The granulation of the slugs was performed by \nmeans of a mechanical granulator (Erweka TGIIS), in \norder to obtain granules of a particle size of less than 2.0 \nmm. Then, the granules were submitted to an oscillating \ngranulator (Erweka FGS), equipped with 1.0 mm sieve to \nstandardize the diameter. The granules in the range of 250 \nto 1000 ?m of diameter were selected through the use of \nsieving with 0.250 and 1.0 mm mesh.\n\nTable 1.

The \nmagnification employed were, respectively, 3.2x for SDP \nand 10x for SDG.\n\nBulk and tapped density, hausner\u2019s factor, carr\u2019s index, \nand densification index\n\n The bulk and tapped densities were determined \nusing 10.0 g of each material in a 25 mL graduated cylinder \n(compacting volumeter J. Engelsmann). The values \nobtained from these parameters were used to calculate the \nHausner\u2019s factor (Hausner, 1967), the Carr\u2019s index (Carr, \n1965), and the densification index (Guyot, 1995).\n\nAngle of repouse (Parthirana &amp; Gupta, 1976)\n\n The angle of repouse was determined using \na device consisting of a mobile cylinder, adjusted to \n\n\n\n805\nRev.

Bassani\n\nthe fixed base and attached to a motor which, when \nactivated, separates the cylinder from the base by lifting \nit. The measure was taken directly on the register of the \npowder cone shadows projected onto the plane, and the \nangle of repouse (?) was obtained by calculation of its \ntangent. Thirty milliliters of each sample were used for \nthe analysis. The results were expressed by the average of \nthree determinations.\n\nDetermination of granule friability (Prista, 2003)\n\n Nearly 40 mL of granules, measured in a 100 mL \ngraduated cylinder, were selected using a sieving with mesh \nopening of 0.250 mm. A sample of the fraction retained \nin the sieve, corresponding to 30 mL, was weighed and \ntransferred, carefully, to the 100 mL graduated cylinder. \nAfter having been closed and attached to the friabilometer, \nthe mixture was submitted to spinning for 15 min, at 20 \nrpm. Then, the sample was once again submitted to the \ninitial procedure in view to remove the fine particles. The \nfriability was calculated based on the percentage of fine \nparticles released.\n\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM)\n\n SEM photomicrographies of SDP and SDG \nparticles were obtained using a scanning electron \nmicroscope (Jeol JSM 6060). The samples were set up \nover stubs of aluminum using bi-adhesive tape made of \ncarbon and metallized with gold coating, using the Jeol Jee \n4B metallizer (JVG-IN).\n\nLiquid chromatography (LC) analysis\n\n The three main phenolic constituents, quercetin, \nluteolin, and 3-O-methylquercetin were determined in \nSDP and SDG following the method reported by De Souza \net al. (2002). For each sample, 500 mg (SPD or SDG) \nwere extracted using 50.0 mL of ethyl acetate for 2 h \nunder mechanical agitation. The liquid dispersion obtained \nwas filtered and the solvent evaporated. The residue was \ndissolved with methanol and transferred to the volumetric \nflask of 25.0 mL. The volume was completed with solvent. \nAn aliquot of 2.0 mL of this solution was diluted to 20.0 \nmL with a mixture of methanol:water solution (53:47, v/v), \nthus constituting the sample solution. Injections of 20 ?L \nof this solution, in triplicate, were performed. A mixture \nof methanol and aqueous solution of 1% phosphoric acid \n(w/v) in the proportion of 53:47 (v/v) was the elluent, in an \nisocratic system, previously filtered through polyvinylidene \nfluoride membrane and degassed in an ultra-sound bath. \nChromatographic conditions included: elluent flow of \n0.6 mL/min and detection at 362 nm. The sensibility was \n1.0 AUFS. Each sample SDP or SDG was analyzed in \ntriplicate.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nPreparation and evaluation of spray dried powders\n\n The parameters for preparation the spray dried \npowder in a semi-industrial scale (Minor production spray \ndryer plant, NIRO) were selected based on the conditions \nreported by Da Silva (2003), using the same equipment. \nThe volume of the extractive solution, submitted to spray \ndrying, was 63.0 L, which contained 7.95% (w/w) of \ndry residue (plant constituents plus the excipients). The \ndrying process resulted in, approximately, 5.0 kg of SDP, \ncharacterizing a processing yield of 88%.\n The SDP appeared as a fine yellow powder with \ncharacteristic odor and tendency to form agglomerates. The \nloss on drying of the SDP was 5.27%\u00b10.01. If we consider \nthis result as corresponding to the residual humidity, this \nvalue is within the limits accepted for powders with non-\nhermetic packaging (max 6% to 7%) (List &amp; Schmidt, \n1989), yet above the maximum limit of 4% set for dry \nextracts (Farmacop\u00e9ia Brasileira, 1988). The particle size \ndistribution of SDP (Figure 1) reveals that, approximately, \n50% of the particles present diameters below 13 ?m, \nwhile, approximately, 90% below 23 ?m, characterizing \nthe SDP as a very fine powder (Farmacop\u00e9ia Brasileira, \n1988). This characteristic of fine powder can be related, \npartially at least, to the use of colloidal silicon dioxide as \ndrying excipient, and/or to the low concentration of soluble \nsolids in the feed solution (List &amp; Schmidt, 1989; Masters, \n1976).\n The low mean size of the SDP particles (13.09 \n?m\u00b13.23) is characteristic of spray dried powders obtained \nfrom Achyrocline satureioides (Lam.) DC., Asteraceae, \nextractive solution in similar operational conditions using \ncolloidal silicon dioxide as excipient (Lemos Senna, \n1993; Da Silva, 2003). The standard deviation observed, \nhigher than 2.0, represents a wide range of particle size \ndistribution (Wells, 1988), which can be observed in the \nSDP analysis in Figure 1.\n Table 2 presents the results of the characterization \nof the compactability and the flow of SDP, which \ncharacterize SDP as a powder with potential problems of \ncompactability and non-spontaneous flow due to its stable \npacking. Even the difficulty in determining the angle of \nrepouse, characterized by high relative standard deviation, \ncorroborates this tendency. The SDP photomicrographies \n(Figure 2) reveal that the particles present spheroidal form \nwith porous and rough surface, but of small dimension.\n The LC profile of the major polyphenols, quercetin, \nluteolin, and 3-O-methylquercetin, from SDP is showed \nin the Figure 3, while the corresponding concentration is \npresented in the Table 3.\n In summary, the results demonstrate that the \nspray drying of an A. satureioides extractive solution in \nsemi-industrial scale resulted in a powder with excellent \nproduction yielding. However, the particles presented \n\n\n\n806\nRev. Bras. Farmacogn.\nBraz. J. Pharmacogn.\n20(5): Out./Nov. 2010\n\nAchyrocline satureioides (Lam.)

Particle size distribution of the A. satureioides spray \ndried powder.\n\nPreparation of SDP granules (SDG)\n\nPreparation and characterization of the slugs\n\n The granules were prepared by compaction \nfollowed of disaggregation. For compaction, the choice \nof the excipients was based on the results reported by De \nSouza et al. (2005) (F1) and Couto (2000) (F2), who defi ned \nthe use of microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, \nand colloidal silicon dioxide as appropriate excipients for \nother herbal derivatives granules (Phyllanthus niruri).\n It is well know that the slugs for granulation \nshould present a thickness in the range of 3 to 4 mm \nin view to facilitate the disaggregation process (Prista, \n\n2003). In this manner, in our tests the average weight \nwas adjusted so that the slugs would present a thickness \nwithin this range and hardness higher than 50 N. This \nvalue of hardness, higher than that usually set for tablets \n(Farmacop\u00e9ia Brasileira, 1988), of 30 N, is due to the \nrequirement that compact must be able to resist breakage, \nwithout the loss of large quantities of fi ne powders in the \ngranulation process. With this, we were able to obtain \nslugs with average weight of 0.7 g.\n During compaction of the F1 or F2 to obtain \nthe slug, an atypical phenomenon was observed, which \ndeserves mention. When high penetration of the upper \npunch in the matrix was applied, the compact change its \ncolor, appearing completely darkened. We also observed \nthat when the penetration of the upper punch was \nadjusted to lower deepness, no darkness in the slugs was \nobserved. The fi rst hypothesis formulated to explain this \nphenomenon was the degrading of the fl avonoids, and/or \na possible infl uence of compression excipients (Schreier \n&amp; Miller, 1985). To elucidate these hypothesis, slugs \nwith and without color changing were produced using the \nF2 formulation. The analysis of the these slugs, by LC, \nwas then performed and signifi cant differences in the \nconcentration of the major fl avonoids between the F2 Slug \n(without color changing) and the corresponding darkened \nslugs were found (Table 3). Additionally, in order to check \nthe infl uence of the excipients added to the slugs obtention \nin the darkness phenomena, slugs only with SDP in \nabsence of any excipient with (SD dark slug) and without \nthe presence of darkness (SD slug) were also prepared and \nanalyzed. As fi rst observed also in this case, when high \npenetration of the upper punch in the matrix was applied, \nthe compact appeared completely darkened.

Bassani\n\n The slugs were, therefore, prepared by adjusting \nthe penetration of the upper punch in such way as to reach \nthe hardness of the slug, which would not cause the color \nchange of the material. Thus, the obtained compacts were \ndesigned, respectively, F1 and F2 slugs. Its technological \ncharacteristics (Table 4) differ significantly (? = 0.05). \nDespite no quality specifications are available for slugs \nproduced by dry granulation, the technological assessment \nallows a comparative analysis of their characteristics from \nthe different formulations. For this reason, in this study \nspecification for tablets was referred for comparison. The \ndifferences observed between the average weights of F1 \nand F2 slugs, although statistically significant, can be \nconsidered acceptable under the technological point of \nview. In any case, these can be attributed to the difference \nof flow and filling of the compression chamber between F1 \nand F2.\n The F1 formulation resulted in slugs with \ndeformation characteristics which became the evaluation of \nits hardness and friability not possible. The characteristics \nof deformation of F1 slugs resulted in extremely high values \nof hardness. The compact did not break during the hardness \ntest, the material when crushed, became deformed causing \nruptures only in their centers. Maintaining the crushing \nforce until the maximum limit of the hardness tester, the \nfinal value was extremely high. Thus, the value presented \nin Table 4 expresses the force applied at the moment that \n\n(Table 3) demonstrate that the slugs containing only SDP, \nwithout color changing, presented no significant difference \n(? = 0.05) among the phenolics concentration compared to \nthat in correspondent slugs with color change; therefore, \nit can be inferred that the darkness of the slugs was not \ndetermined by the flavonoid degradation, neither by the \npresence of the excipients The concentration of phenolics \nin the slug takes into account only the amount of SDP, \ndisregarding the excipients that compose the slugs.\n Although this is not the main focus of the present \nwork, we cannot fail to mention the observations made \nby Smith and his collaborators (Smith et al., 2000), who, \nupon studying the photostability of some polyphenols, \namong them luteolin and quercetin, confirmed that after \nexposing these to luminous radiation, it was possible to \nobserve changes in their coloration due to modifications in \ntheir reflectances. The yellow coloration of the quercetin \nis lost quickly, while the coloration of the luteolin become \nblackening. The authors attribute such modifications to the \nprobable formation of molecular aggregates with changing \nthe ?max to higher wavelengths than those presented by \nnon-aggregated polyphenols. In the present work, it is not \npossible to establish a relationship between the presence \nof aggregates and the interaction of the excipients in the \nSDP. Further investigations to enlighten this phenomenon \nin a complex matrix as an herbal powder are running in our \nLaboratory.\n\nFigure 2.

After the analysis \ntime had lapsed, the slugs presented an increase in their \nweight. The test was repeated three times with similar \nresults. A plausible explanation for such phenomenon is \nthe hygroscopy of the SDP since this can be found in a \nproportion of 99% (w/w) in the slugs. The friability test of \nthe F2 slugs did not presented this phenomenon, and showed \nthat the resistance to the abrasion is below the maximum \nlimit allowed for tablets (Farmacop\u00e9ia Brasileira, 1988), \nwhose accepted value is the maximum loss of 1.5% (w/w) \nof its weight.\n The F1 slugs presented disintegration time of 39 \nmin, value above the maximum limit (30 min) specifi ed \nfor tablets (Farmacop\u00e9ia Brasileira, 1988). In contrast, the \nF2 slugs is within the set limits, difference which can be \nrelated to the presence of microcrystalline cellulose in F2 \n(Kibbe, 2000; Hoepfner et al., 2002; The United States \nPharmacopoeia, 2008). The concentration of the major \nfl avonoids in the F2 slugs is presented in Table 3.\n Taken together, the characteristics presented by \nthe F2 slugs determined its selection for the next step of dry \ngranulation.\n\nFigure 3.

Flow of 0.6 mL/min, detection at 362 nm, \nsensibility of 1.0 AUFS.\n\nGranulation and characterization of the granules\n\n The yield of the granulation process was 60%. \nDespite the low F2 slug friability, the granulation process \npresented a larger production of fi ne powders, characteristic \nalready reported for other herbal products (De Souza et al., \n2005; Couto et al., 2000).\n The average size of the granules obtained from F2 \nslugs (SDG) was 1.19 mm\u00b10.31. The analysis of the particle \nsize distribution of the SDG (Figure 4) allows observing \nthat more than 90% of the particles presented diameters \n\nwithin the range of 0.7 to 1.7 mm, while approximately \n58% presented diameters between 0.7 and 1.3 mm.\n As regards the technological parameters, in an \noverview, the granules presented better compactability \nand fl ow characteristics than those of the SDP (Table 2). \nIn addition, lower values of bulk and tapped densities \nwere observed due to the increase in the particle size, \novercoming one of the main limitations of SDP.\n The Hausner\u2019s factor observed (1.089) indicates \na better packing stability of the granules in comparison to \nthose of the SDP (1.234). The value of the compressibility \nindex (Carr\u2019s index) (8.16) shows an improvement in the \nfl ow properties of the SDG as compared to that of the SDP \n(18.93). Carr\u2019s index values of above 15% characterize \nmaterials presenting poor fl owability and problems in the \npacking, which is the case of SDP and other herbal spray \ndried powders (Couto et al., 2000; Augsburger &amp; Vuppala, \n1997; Summers &amp; Aulton, 2002).\n The densifi cation index, which for the SDP is \nhigher than 20 mL, characterize it as being a material with \npotential limitations in packing during the compression \nprocess (Guyot et al., 1995). The granulation of SDP \ncaused a signifi cant improvement in this characteristic \n(SDG; 12.3 mL).\n Regarding the angle of repouse, in a fi rst view, \nthe results observed for the SDG and SDP (below 30o) \nwould characterize both as free fl ow materials. However, \nthe fl ow of SDP occurs in blocks, differently of the SDG, \nwhich presents a regular fl ow.\n The friability of the granules was 7.35% (w/w). \nWhen compared with the friability of the slugs from which \nit was originated (0.17%), can be observed an increase, \nmost likely due to the disaggregation process. The loss \nof drying of the SDG was 5.72% (w/w). Bearing in mind \nthis value as the residual humidity, this parameter can be \nconsidered to be within the defi ned limit for packaged \npowders in non-hermetic containers (List &amp; Schmidt, \n1989).\n\nFigure 4.

Isotherms of humidity absorption for A. satureioides spray dried powders (?) and the corresponding granules (?) in \nenvironments of controlled atmospheres with relative humidity of 65% (- - -) and 99% (     ).\n\n\n\n810\n\n(Figure 5c and 5d), can be observed structures with rounded \nextremities, whose form remained unchanged even after \nthe stages of compaction and disaggregation. The presence \nof microcrystalline cellulose fibers is also observed.\n The polyphenol LC analysis of the granules \nreveals the presence of peaks with retention times identical \nto those presented in the SDP (Figure 3). However, they \nare in lower intensity due to the presence of excipients. \nThe corresponding concentrations in the SDG are showed \nin Table 3. No additional peaks were observed in the \nchromatogram, denoting the absence of degradation \nproduct detectable by the employed chromatographic \nsystem.\n The exposure of SDP and SDG to environments \nwith relative humidity of 65% and 99% demonstrated \nthat both are sensitive to the humidity (Figure 6). As can \nbe verified, the SDP exposed to the relative humidity of \n65% presented rapid increase in weight over the first 24 \nh, absorbing approximately 10.20% (w/w) of its weight \nin water and progressing in a lower proportion in the \nsubsequent hours until reaching stability. Likewise, when \nsubmitted to the relative humidity of 99%, the initial \nincrease was very quick, considering that in the first 24 h \nit absorbed 24.36% (w/w) of its weight in water. In both \nrelative humidities, the presence of agglomerates was \nobserved in the SDP at the end of 11 d. The SDG presented \nlower absorption of humidity in both environments of \nrelative humidity of 65% and 99%, absorbing, respectively, \n7.64% (w/w) and 20.84% (w/w) of its weight in water, over \nthe first 24 h. After this period, there was a tendency for the \nstability of absorption of humidity in both environments \nof relative humidity. This lower absorption of humidity \npresented by SDG can be mainly related to the lesser \nsurface area exposed to the atmosphere, without ruled out \nthe role of the excipients within the formulation (De Souza \net al., 2005; Miller, 1997; Ansel et al., 2000). As regards \nthe sensorial characteristics, neither the SDP nor the SDG \npresented changes in coloration in the relative humidity \nenvironment of 65%. However, in the 99% relative \nhumidity environment, the both powders became brown. \nStudies above the stability of A. satureioides powder and \nits major flavonoids against ambiental conditions were \nperformed by Holzschuh et al. (2007) and corroborate with \nour results. In this study the instability of these flavonoids \nwas evaluated, especially under stress conditions (90% \nrelative humidity and temperature of 50 oC), but the \nelucidation of the degradation and oxidation products still \nhas to be enlightened.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n The A. satureioides (Lam.) DC., Asteraceae, spray \ndried powder was prepared in semi-industrial scale, from \n40% ethanol extractive solution, with an excellent yield \nin the spray drying process (88%). Nevertheless, its flow \nand compactability characteristics were not appropriate \n\nfor the preparation of derivative pharmaceutical forms, \nespecially by direct compression. The granulation of the \nspray dried powder allowed the obtaining of the granule, \nwhose technological characteristics as Hausner\u2019s factor, \nthe Carr\u2019s index, and the densification index revealed more \nfavorable properties.\n In summary this first report on the preparation \nof granules from Achyrocline satureioides spray dried \npowders demonstrated, besides its feasibility, that the \ngranules presented better technological characteristics, \novercoming one of the main limitations of SDP.\n Moreover, the results open several investigative \nperspectives in view to optimize the product and to \nenlighten the darkness phenomenon observed when high \ncompression forces were employed.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\n We wish to thank to the Brazilian government for \nthe funding of this research and scholarship, through the \ngovernmental agencies CNPq and CAPES.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAnsel HC, Popovich NG, Allen LV 2000.
