Stepping in \u201cthe end of the world\u201d and getting in \n\ncontact with the Antarctic territory allowed me to better understand the importance of \n\nmonitoring the impacts of climate change in such sensitive environment and empowered my \n\nmotivation to carry out this study. \n\nMany thanks to Gabriel Goyanes, who accompanied me on the journey and supported me in \n\nevery adventure working on field. Without his patience, Antarctic experience and drone pilot \n\nskills, I would not have been able to get all the fundamental data indispensable to carry out \n\nthis work. \n\nSpecial acknowledgments to the Portuguese Polar Program 2017/18 (PROPOLAR) for \n\nfunding this research and facilitating the logistics that make possible the larger scale project \n\nabout \u201cPermafrost and Climate Change in the Antarctic Peninsula\u201d (PTDC/AAG-\n\nGLO/3908/2012 \u2013 FCT, Portugal). Also, to Ana Salom\u00e9 for all the support provided during \n\nmy trip to Antarctica and for her great skills to handle any kind of incident.  \n\nThanks as well to the project \u201cImpact of Recent Climate Warming on Active-Layer \n\nDynamics, Permafrost, and Soil Properties on the Western Antarctic Peninsula\u201d (ANT-\n\n6900673) from the National Science Foundation (USA), in which the boreholes used in this \n\nwork were installed. On the framework of this project, Prof. James Bockheim and Dr. Kelly \n\nWilhelm provided the shallow borehole data for the years from 2012 to 2014.   \n\nAlways thankful with my father, Miguel Ramos, who introduced and guided me on my first \n\nsteps into the world of polar sciences, with the passion and enthusiasm of who devoted his life \n\nto the research in Antarctica. Thanks as well to my mum, the one that stands my anxiety and \n\nalways have the magic words to keep me calm in the most stressful situations. \n\n \n\nFinally, yet important, thanks to all my colleagues, teachers and friends that helped me during \n\nthe last two years, either with advice, knowledge or encouragement. \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\nI \n\n \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS ............................................................................................................................................

To evaluate the changes occurring in these environments, permafrost and \n\nactive layer monitoring and modelling are essential. In this dissertation, the characteristics of \n\nthe ground temperature regime are analysed and the spatial distribution of the \u201cTemperature at \n\nthe Top of Permafrost\u201d (TTOP) in Cierva Point (Danco Coast, WAP) is estimated using topo-\n\nclimatic information over an area of 0.65 km2. With the results, the climate sensitivity of \n\npermafrost in this area and the potential impact of small climate change in its extent are \n\nevaluated. \n\n \n\nA first evaluation of the temperature regimes allowed to determine the temperature and depth \n\nof the permafrost table and the ground thermal offset using observed borehole and climate \n\ndata from nine different monitoring sites, in selected periods from 2012 to 2018.  The top of \n\npermafrost was observed at depths of 0.4, 1 and 5m and the temperature at these depths was \n\nobserved to be -1.4 \u00baC, -2.6 \u00baC and 1.2 \u00baC in these locations. For the monitoring boreholes \n\nwhere the top of permafrost was not reached, the depth of the top of permafrost was estimated \n\nto range between 0.4 and 5 m with temperatures ranging between -0.2 \u00baC and -2.6 \u00baC. \n\n \n\nThe results were used together with topographic data to implement the spatial TTOP model \n\nusing a Geographical Information System (GIS)-based methodology to implement a high-\n\nresolution model (1 x 1 m grid cell) that allows a further insight into the spatial characteristics \n\nof permafrost.  \n\nPermafrost was estimated to be present in nearly 88% of the area and the lower TTOP values \n\nwere found at high altitudes and unconsolidated soil or peat areas covered by moss. The \n\nhighest TTOP results were found at low altitudes, bare surfaces and concave areas. Bare \n\nsurfaces increase exposure to solar radiation during the summer and the concavity of the \n\nterrain promotes higher snowpack accumulation during the winter, which acts as a good \n\nthermal insulator hindering ground energy loses. \n\nIn the areas where the mean temperature at the top of permafrost was found to be higher than \n\n0 \u00baC, permafrost is absent and the TTOP stands for the temperature at the base of the seasonal \n\nfreezing layer.  \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\nXI \n\n \n\nAn increment of the TTOP was observed in case of a hypothetical long-term increase of 1 \u00baC \n\nin the MAAT and the results suggest the disappearance of nearly 50% of the current modelled \n\npermafrost area. Ground temperatures resulted to be more sensitive to the temperature \n\nincrement at bare ground surfaces and/or concave sites. The less sensitive areas were the ones \n\ncovered by moss formations as well as the most convex. \n\nPermafrost degradation in Cierva Point, which is an Antarctic Specially Protected Area, may \n\nlead to significate impacts in the local ecosystem.  \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: Permafrost, Active layer, temperature regime, Western Antarctic Peninsula, TTOP. \n\n\n\n  \n\nXII \n\n \n\nResumo \n\nDurante as \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas, a regi\u00e3o ocidental da Pen\u00ednsula Ant\u00e1rtica manifestou rea\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ncomplexas \u00e0s mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas e as suas causas ainda n\u00e3o foram completamente \n\ncompreendidas. Na segunda metade do s\u00e9culo XX, foi observada uma tend\u00eancia de \n\naquecimento na Pen\u00ednsula Ant\u00e1rtica. Contudo, a partir do in\u00edcio do s\u00e9culo XXI, observou-se \n\numa tend\u00eancia para o arrefecimento em algumas regi\u00f5es da Pen\u00ednsula. Com o objetivo de \n\navaliar os efeitos destas rea\u00e7\u00f5es nos ambientes livres de gelo da regi\u00e3o, \u00e9 importante a \n\nmonitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o e modela\u00e7\u00e3o do permafrost e da camada ativa. O permafrost \u00e9 definido como \n\nsolo permanentemente congelado (mant\u00e9m a temperatura a/ou abaixo de 0 \u00baC durante pelo \n\nmenos dois anos). A camada compreendida entre a superf\u00edcie do solo e o topo do permafrost, \n\ne que congela e descongela sazonalmente, \u00e9 designada como \u201ccamada ativa\u201d.  \n\nNesta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o, s\u00e3o analisadas as carater\u00edsticas do regime t\u00e9rmico do solo em Cierva Point \n\n(Costa de Danco Coast, Pen\u00ednsula Ant\u00e1rtica Ocidental), numa \u00e1rea com 0.65 km2 e apresenta-\n\nse um mapa da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial da Temperatura no Topo do Permafrost (TTOP), usando \n\ndados topoclim\u00e1ticos observados e modelizados. Com os resultados, \u00e9 avaliada a \n\nsensibilidade clim\u00e1tica do permafrost e o potencial impacte que mudan\u00e7as na temperatura \n\nm\u00e9dia anual poder\u00e3o causar na sua extens\u00e3o. \n\n \n\nInicialmente, foi desenvolvida uma an\u00e1lise do regime t\u00e9rmico do solo em nove locais com \n\ndiferentes carater\u00edsticas usando dados clim\u00e1ticos e de temperaturas do solo observados de \n\n2012 a 2018 em perfura\u00e7\u00f5es instaladas na \u00e1rea de estudo. Esta an\u00e1lise, permitiu a \n\ndetermina\u00e7\u00e3o da espessura e da variabilidade interanual da camada ativa, da temperatura e \n\nprofundidade do topo do permafrost, e finalmente, do offset t\u00e9rmico do solo (diferen\u00e7a de \n\ntemperatura entre a superf\u00edcie do solo e o topo do permafrost) nestes nove locais. O topo do \n\npermafrost (TOP) foi encontrado em tr\u00eas dos nove locais com diferentes carater\u00edsticas a 0,4, 1 \n\ne 5 m de profundidade e com temperaturas de -1.4 \u00baC, -2.6 \u00baC e 1.2 \u00baC, respetivamente. \n\nContudo, os dados mostraram que a presen\u00e7a de permafrost \u00e9 poss\u00edvel em oito dos nove \n\nlocais, embora a profundidades maiores que aquelas de algumas perfura\u00e7\u00f5es, que apenas se \n\nencontram na camada ativa. As temperaturas no topo do permafrost estimadas nestes nove \n\nlocais variam entre -0,2 \u00baC e -2,6 \u00baC. Em geral, o topo do permafrost foi observado a maior \n\nprofundidade em locais com afloramentos rochosos, seguindo-se os dep\u00f3sitos n\u00e3o \n\nconsolidados e os substratos org\u00e2nicos formados por musgos. \n\n\n\n  \n\nXIII \n\n \n\nOs resultados da an\u00e1lise do regime t\u00e9rmico foram utilizados, em conjunto com dados \n\ntopogr\u00e1ficos, para a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de um modelo espacial da \u201cTemperatura no Topo do \n\nPermafrost\u201d (TTOP) em toda a \u00e1rea de estudo, usando uma metodologia baseada nos \n\nSistemas de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o Geogr\u00e1fica (SIG). Para a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o do modelo TTOP, foram \n\ndeterminadas rela\u00e7\u00f5es estat\u00edsticas entre os fatores topogr\u00e1ficos e os par\u00e2metros que \n\nconstituem o modelo usando como base os dados observados nos nove locais. O software \n\nSPSS Statistics 25 foi o utilizado para estimar as correla\u00e7\u00f5es estat\u00edsticas entre fatores \n\ntopogr\u00e1ficos e par\u00e2metros observados e para determinar as rela\u00e7\u00f5es matem\u00e1ticas existentes \n\nentre eles. Mais tarde, as rela\u00e7\u00f5es estat\u00edsticas encontradas foram espacialmente computadas \n\nsob a \u00e1rea de estudo mediante o software ArcMap 10.4, e finalmente aplicou-se a equa\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nmodelo sob a \u00e1rea de estudo completa. \n\n \n\nO resultado foi um modelo TTOP de alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o (1 m) que oferece pela primeira vez uma \n\nperspectiva da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial do permafrost em Cierva Point. Os resultados do modelo \n\nTTOP ilustram os valores mais baixos (at\u00e9 -6.2 \u00baC) em solos org\u00e2nicos ou pouco consolidados \n\ncobertos por musgos e em altitude, do que em \u00e1reas de menor altitude de rocha nua, h\u00famidas \n\ne em terrenos c\u00f4ncavos \n\nOs valores da Temperatura no Topo do Permafrost modelizada mais elevados (superiores a 0 \n\n\u00baC e at\u00e9 3,5 \u00baC), encontraram-se em \u00e1reas mais baixas, h\u00famidas e com topografia c\u00f4ncava. \n\nNestas \u00e1reas, os valores resultantes representam, efetivamente, a temperatura na base do solo \n\ngelado sazonal.  \n\n \n\nEmbora a profundidade do topo do permafrost seja desconhecida, os resultados mostram que \n\no permafrost dever\u00e1 estar presente em 88% da \u00e1rea de estudo, estando ausente especialmente \n\nem setores com solo n\u00fa em altitudes inferiores a 120 m e com topografia c\u00f4ncava. \n\nO modelo espacial desenvolvido foi ainda usado para identificar a potencial sensibilidade do \n\npermafrost face a um cen\u00e1rio hipot\u00e9tico de aumento da temperatura m\u00e9dia anual do ar de \n\nlongo prazo de 1 \u00baC, considerando est\u00e1veis os restantes fatores como a precipita\u00e7\u00e3o, a neve, a \n\nhumidade do solo, a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos musgos, etc. Os resultados indicam um significativo \n\naumento na temperatura no topo do permafrost, correspondendo a um valor m\u00e9dio de +1.2 \u00baC, \n\ne o poss\u00edvel desaparecimento das condi\u00e7\u00f5es para a manuten\u00e7\u00e3o do permafrost em cerca de \n\n50% da \u00e1rea com permafrost na atualidade. A \u00e1rea com permafrost, ficaria ent\u00e3o reduzida a \n\ncerca de 43% da \u00e1rea de estudo. Os setores mais sens\u00edveis a esta mudan\u00e7a de temperatura s\u00e3o \n\n\n\n  \n\nXIV \n\n \n\nas \u00e1reas localizadas a menor altitude, caraterizadas por superf\u00edcies nuas e/ou elevados valores \n\nde concavidade topogr\u00e1fica. As \u00e1reas menos sens\u00edveis ao impacte do aumento de temperatura \n\ns\u00e3o as com cobertura de musgos, pois estes atuam como isolante t\u00e9rmico, assim como as \u00e1reas \n\ncom topografia convexa. \n\n \n\nA din\u00e2mica do permafrost \u00e9 especialmente importante em Cierva Point, que \u00e9 uma \u00c1rea \n\nEspecialmente Protegida no quadro do Sistema do Tratado para a Ant\u00e1rtida (ASPA), devido \u00e0 \n\npresen\u00e7a de uma col\u00f3nia de pinguins Gentoo, assim como de coberturas de l\u00edquenes e \n\nmusgos. A redu\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1rea com permafrost poder\u00e1 influenciar significativamente o \n\necossistema local, pelos seus impactes na hidrologia e consequentemente, na flora. As \n\npropriedades imperme\u00e1veis do permafrost promovem o escoamento de \u00e1gua nos horizontes \n\nsuperficiais do solo ou \u00e0 superf\u00edcie, bem como a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de pequenas lagoas tempor\u00e1rias. O \n\ndescongelamento do permafrost, poder\u00e1 induzir o aumento da infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o em profundidade, \n\nreduzindo a \u00e1gua dispon\u00edvel para a vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: Permafrost, camada ativa, regime de temperaturas, Pen\u00ednsula Ant\u00e1rctica Ocidental, TTOP. \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\nXV \n\n \n\nAcronyms \n\nCALM: Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring. \n\nDSM: Digital Surface Model. \n\nDZAA: Depth of Zero Annual Amplitude. \n\nECV: Essential Climate Variable. \n\nGCOS: Global Climate Observing System.  \n\nGST: Ground Surface Temperature. \n\nGTN-P: Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost. \n\nIPA: International Permafrost Association.  \n\nIPCC: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  \n\nMAGST: Mean Annual Ground Surface Temperature. \n\nMaxAST: Maximum Annual Surface Temperature.  \n\nMDAT: Mean Daily Air Temperature. \n\nMinAST: Minimum Annual Surface Temperature. \n\nToffset: Thermal offset. \n\nTSP: Thermal State of Permafrost. \n\nTTOP: Temperature at the Top Of Permafrost. \n\nTWI: Topographic Wetness Index. \n\nUNEP: United Nations Environmental Programme. \n\nUNFCC: United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  \n\nWAP: Western Antarctic Peninsula. \n\nWMO: World Meteorological Organization. \n\nZAA: Zero Annual Amplitude. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Permafrost_Association\n\n\n  \n\n1 \n\n \n\n1 Introduction \n\n1.1 Objectives \n\nThe main objective of this dissertation is to characterize the permafrost in Cierva Point \n\n(Western Antarctic Peninsula) and evaluate its climate sensitivity by assessing the main \n\npotential impact of small climate changes in the permafrost extent of this ice-free environment \n\narea.  In order to achieve this goal, we analysed the area\u2019s ground temperature regime and \n\ncreated a GIS-based spatial model of the Temperature at the Top Of Permafrost (TTOP) based \n\non statistical relations between certain topographic factors and locally computed TTOP \n\nparameters from climate observed data. \n\nThis work is included on the larger-scale framework of permafrost research in the ice-free \n\nterrestrial environments of Western Antarctic Peninsula, which aim to evaluate permafrost \n\ndynamics and its linkages to recent climate changes through systematic and long-term \n\nmonitoring and modelling of ground and climate properties.

Permafrost forms in cold climates generally distinct \n\nby long winters without much of snow and short, dry and cold summers. In regions with such \n\nthis climate, some of the ground frozen during the winter will not completely thaw during the \n\nsummer; therefore, a permanent frozen layer will form and continue to grow downward \n\ngradually each year constituting the permafrost (P\u00e9w\u00e9, 1979).  \n\n \n\nPermafrost is distributed on Earth covering great stretches of land at high latitudes and \n\naltitudes in both hemispheres. In the Northern Hemisphere, permafrost occupies about 24% of \n\nthe exposed land area in the Arctic and sub-Arctic, including large areas in Russia, Alaska and \n\nCanada. In the Southern Hemisphere, permafrost occurs in most ice-free regions of Antarctica \n\n(Schaefer et al., 2012; Bockheim et al., 2012). Alpine permafrost may exist at high altitudes in \n\nmuch lower latitudes, being present in the high mountains of South America, Central Asia, \n\nthe United States and Europe (P\u00e9w\u00e9, 1979). \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n1.2.2 DISTRIBUTION OF PERMAFROST \n\nPermafrost regions are classified into zones based on its spatial distribution. \u201cContinuous \n\npermafrost\u201d zones have permafrost underlying 90-100% of the land area; \u201cdiscontinuous \n\npermafrost\u201d zones have 50-90% of permafrost; and \u201csporadic permafrost\u201d around the 10-\n\n50%. \u201cIsolated patches\u201d refer to regions where permafrost underlies less than 10% of the \n\nland area (Schaefer et al., 2012). Permafrost also occurs subsea on the continental shelves of \n\nthe surrounding continent of the Arctic Ocean and Antarctica. \n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere permafrost occurs almost continuously in large areas, being \n\nnormally absent under lakes and rivers that do not freeze to the bottom (P\u00e9w\u00e9, 1979). The \n\nlocation of the boundary of the continuous permafrost zone variates around the world because \n\nof regional climate controls. In areas characterized by warmer climates, permafrost occurs \n\nonly in sheltered locations, usually with a north aspect (in the Northern Hemisphere) or south \n\naspect (in the South Hemisphere), creating discontinuous, sporadic or isolated permafrost. \n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, most of the Antarctic continent is overlain by glaciers and liable \n\nto basal melting (Zoltikov, 1962). The exposed ice-free land of Antarctica is extensively \n\nunderlain with permafrost, some of which is liable to warming and thawing along the \n\ncoastline (Campbell &amp; Claridge, 2009).  \n\nFigure 1 represents the distribution of different types of permafrost in both South and North \n\nhemispheres. \n\nFigure 1. Distribution of permafrost in the North (left) and South (right) hemispheres (Brown et al., 1997). \n\n \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Ocean\n\n\n  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n1.2.2 PERMAFROST STRUCTURE AND THERMAL REGIME  \n\nThe vertical structure of permafrost is determined by the ground temperatures at different \n\ndepths and is represented in Figure 2.  \n\nWhen permafrost is present in areas not overlain by ice, it occurs beneath a layer of soil, rock \n\nor sediment, which freezes and thaws annually, which is called the active layer (Staff, 2014). \n\nThe active layer generally starts thawing in spring after snow melt and may stay thawed until \n\nautumn, while its maximum depth is reached in late summer. It begins to refreeze in autumn \n\nwith the onset of winter and is completely frozen by late winter or early spring (Schaefer et \n\nal., 2012). \n\nThe active layer thickness is the annual maximum thaw depth at the end of the summer. It \n\ndepends mainly on the moisture content, being thinner in wet, organic sediments and thicker \n\nin well-drained gravels or bedrock. Active layer thickness can be less than 30 cm in \n\ncontinuous permafrost along the Arctic coast and the Antarctic continent, where values range \n\ngenerally from 0.2 to 0.7 m, occasionally with >0.9 m in coastal sites and with very shallow \n\nactive layers (<0.1 m) at high elevation sites (Vieira et al., 2010). The active layer thickness \n\nusually reaches 2 m or more in discontinuous permafrost of Southern Siberia, and several \n\nmeters in the European Alps and on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (Schaefer et al., 2012). In the \n\nAntarctic Peninsula, the active layer thickness was found to be greater than 0.9 m on \n\nmonitored sites at unconsolidated materials in the South Shetlands Islands, and around 0.3 m \n\nin Deception Island (Vieira et al., 2010).  \n\nUnder the active layer, permafrost occurs at the depth where the maximum annual \n\ntemperature remains below 0 \u00baC, and is bounded on the top by the Top of Permafrost (TOP) \n\nand on the bottom by the Base of Permafrost (BOF) (Schaefer et al., 2012).  \n\n\n\n  \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe annual variations of air temperature from winter to summer is revealed in the active layer \n\nand in the few first meters of the permafrost. In this layer, the ground temperature profile over \n\na temperature to depth graph (Figure 2), presents three different curves that represent the \n\nvariation of ground temperature with depth. The red curve represents the Maximum Annual \n\nGround Temperature (MaxAGT), the dotted line represents the Mean Annual Ground \n\nTemperature (MAGT) and the Minimum Annual Ground Temperature is represented by the \n\nblue curve (MinAGT). \n\n \n\nThe MaxAGT decreases with depth being the depth at which the maximum annual \n\ntemperature reaches 0\u00ba C considered the base of the active layer, and the top of permafrost, \n\nwhich is known as Temperature at the Top Of Permafrost (TTOP). The point where the red \n\ncurve crosses the ground surface represents the Maximum Annual Ground Surface \n\nTemperature (MaxAGST). \n\nThe MinAGT increases with depth being and the point where the blue curve crosses the \n\nground surface represent the Minimum Annual Ground Surface Temperature (MinAGST). \n\nThe MAGT can either increase or decrease depending on a positive or negative ground \n\nthermal offset. The thermal offset\u2019s magnitude is the difference between the mean annual \n\nground temperature at the top of permafrost and the MAGST, and it depends on the soil \n\nthermal properties. \n\nMAGST 0\u00ba MaxAGST MinAGST \n\nT<0\u00baC T>0\u00baC \n\n \n\nIsothermal Permafrost \n\nUnfrozen ground \n\nBase of permafrost \n\nMinAGT \n\nDepth of zero \n\nanual amplitude \n\n(ZAA) \n\nActive layer \n\nTop of Permafrost \n\nMaxAGT \nTTOP \n\nFigure 2. Permafrost vertical structure defined by its ground thermal regime- trumpet curve (modified from: \n\nCassie, n.d.). \n\n\n\n  \n\n5 \n\n \n\nThe point where the dotted line crosses the surface represents the Mean Annual Ground \n\nSurface Temperature (MAGST). \n\n \n\nDespite the curve of the MAGT being often considered linear for simplification of the \n\nmodelling, Goodrich (1978) showed that the MAGT warming at depth is not linear, but \n\noffsets to progressively lower values at depth within the active layer (Smith &amp; Riseborough, \n\n1996). \n\n \n\nUnder the surface, the seasonal ground temperature signal becomes smaller with depth due to \n\nthe thermal balance between the heat flow from the Earth\u2019s interior and that flowing outward \n\ninto the atmosphere. When the amount of geothermal heat reaching the permafrost equals the \n\nheat lost to the atmosphere, the permafrost temperature reaches equilibrium and becomes \n\nseasonally stable at the depth of Zero Annual Amplitude (ZAA) (P\u00e9w\u00e9, 1979). The \n\ntemperature at the Z depth is known as the Temperature at the depth of Zero Annual \n\nAmplitude (TZAA).  Because the maximum temperature at the top of permafrost is 0 \u00baC, no \n\nsignificant phase change occurs at lower depths, such that soil thermal properties below the \n\nactive layer remain relatively constant. For practical purposes, the temperature at the top of \n\npermafrost should be close to the temperature measured at the depth of zero annual amplitude \n\n(Smith &amp; Riseborough, 1996). \n\n \n\nBelow the ZAA depth, the temperature of permafrost does not change seasonally, and hence \n\nthis layer is named isothermal permafrost (Delisle, 2007). In the isothermal permafrost layer, \n\nthe temperature increases steadily under the influence of heat from the Earth\u2019s interior until \n\noverpassing 0 \u00baC due to the geothermal gradient. This point constitutes the base of permafrost \n\n(BOP) (P\u00e9w\u00e9, 1979).  \n\n \n \n\n1.2.3 CONTROLLING FACTORS IN PERMAFROST: CLIMATE, WATER BODIES, SOLAR \n\nRADIATION, VEGETATION AND SNOW \n\nThe distribution and thickness of permafrost are directly affected by climate, ground \n\nproperties and geothermal gradient, topography, snow, vegetation and water cover (P\u00e9w\u00e9, \n\n2016). \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\u2022 Air temperature and climate \n\nAir temperature is the dominant variable controlling global permafrost distribution and \n\nclimate and it directly affects the thickness of the permafrost layer. When the climate warms \n\nto a mean annual air temperature above 0 \u00b0C, the position of the top of permafrost will be \n\nlowered by thawing. As the climate becomes colder or warmer, the temperature of the \n\npermafrost respectively rises or declines, resulting in changes in the position of the bottom of \n\npermafrost. Generally, the colder the climate, the thicker the permafrost layer (P\u00e9w\u00e9, 2016). \n\n \n\nConsidering the relation of the ground characteristics with atmospheric temperatures, \n\npermafrost may be considered as a good indicator of climate sensitivity.  \n\nSeasonal variability in shallow ground temperature reflects variability in air temperature at the \n\nshort-term but becomes increasingly muted with depth. Permafrost temperatures at deeper \n\ndepths reflect variability in climate conditions at longer time scales due to the slow diffusion \n\nof heat through permafrost. Below the ZAA depth, where the permafrost temperature has no \n\nseasonal variation, permafrost temperatures reflect long-term climate variations (Schaefer et \n\nal., 2012). \n\n \n\n\u2022 Ground properties and geothermal gradient  \n\nThe rate at which the base or top of permafrost change depends not only on the magnitude \n\nof climatic fluctuation but also on the ground\u2019s composition, properties and ice content, since \n\nthese factors determine the ground\u2019s thermal conductivity (P\u00e9w\u00e9, 2016).  If the mean annual \n\nair temperature is identic in two different areas, the permafrost layer will be thicker where the \n\nconductivity of the ground is higher and the geothermal gradient is lower.  \n\n \n\u2022 Topography and solar radiation \n\nThe slope and aspect of the ground also influence permafrost formation and active layer \n\nthickness. South-facing hillslopes in the Northern Hemisphere, as well as north-facing slopes \n\nin the Southern Hemisphere, receive more incoming solar energy per unit area than other \n\nslopes and therefore they get warmer. For instance, in the North Hemisphere, permafrost is \n\nusually absent in the regions of discontinuous permafrost in south facing slopes while shaded \n\nnorth facing slopes may develop continuous permafrost (Schaefer et al., 2012) \n\n \n \n\n\n\n  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\u2022 Vegetation  \n\nVegetation and soil organic matter can also influence permafrost formation and active layer \n\nthickness. \n\nTheir effects often result in large variability in active layer thickness within the space of a few \n\nmeters (Humlum, 1998a). Shading by vegetation and the insulating effect of a thick organic \n\nlayer, reduces the solar energy absorbed by the soil, resulting in shallower active layers than \n\nbare exposed soil (Shur &amp; Jorgensen, 2007).  \n\n \n\n\u2022 Snow cover \n\nAfter the air temperature, local snow thickness and characteristics are the dominant variables \n\ncontrolling global permafrost distribution (Schaefer et al., 2012) as they influence heat flow \n\nbetween the ground and the atmosphere (P\u00e9w\u00e9, 2016). Any location with annual average air \n\ntemperatures below freezing can form permafrost (Humlum, 1998b; Stocker-Mittaz et al. \n\n2002). However, depending on the snow accumulation and other environmental factors, \n\npermafrost may even be present in regions with mean annual air temperature as high as 2 \u00b0C \n\nor absent where annual average air temperature is as low as -20 \u00b0C (Jorgensen et al., 2010).  \n\nSnow is a good thermal insulator as it is composed by air and ice crystals in its volume. This \n\nfact often results in ground temperatures 5 to 20 \u00b0C higher than winter air temperatures and \n\npermafrost temperatures 3 to 6 \u00b0C higher than the mean annual air temperature. Snowpack \n\nthickness, timing and duration, hence influence ground temperature (Zhang, 2005; Jorgensen \n\net al., 2010). \n\n \n\u2022 Water bodies \n\nFinally, bodies of water such as lakes, rivers, and the sea show a noticeable effect on the \n\ndistribution of permafrost. A deep lake that does not freeze to the bottom during the winter \n\nwill be underlain by a zone of thawed material. Small, shallow lakes that freeze to the bottom \n\neach winter are underlain by a zone of thawed material, but the thawed zone normally does \n\nnot completely penetrate the surrounding permafrost extent (P\u00e9w\u00e9, 2016). \n\n \n\n1.2.4 TYPICAL LANDFORMS IN PERMAFROST ENVIRONMENTS \n\nPermafrost processes manifest themselves in large-scale landforms, such as thermokarst \n\nphenomena, polygonal ground and pingos. In addition, there are many features caused in large \n\npart by frost action that are common but not restricted to permafrost areas, such as solifluction \n\n(frost creep and flow) and frost-sorted patterned ground. \n\n\n\n  \n\n8 \n\n \n\nThe main geomorphic features present in permafrost environments are described below \n\n(P\u00e9w\u00e9, 2016): \n\n\u2022 Polygonal ground \n\nOne of the most common geomorphic features associated with permafrost is the relief pattern \n\non the surface of the ground, usually called \u201cpolygonal ground\u201d, or \u201ctundra polygons\u201d. This \n\npattern appears with the formation of a network of shallow troughs delineating 3 to 30 m \n\ndiameter polygons and occurs as the result of winter freezing and spring thawing. In winter, \n\nthe soil becomes brittle and cracks due to the contraction in response to cold temperatures. In \n\nspring, meltwater fills the cracks and consequently freezes forming ice wedges (Dick, 2012). \n\nSeason after season, the cracks and ice wedges increase in diameter and depth. From the air \n\nperspective, the tundra will show a pattern of cracks looking like honeycombs (Figure 3).  \n\nIn many areas of the continuous permafrost zone, drainage follows the troughs of the tops of \n\nthe ice wedges forming the polygons; and at ice wedge junctions, melting may occur to form \n\nsmall pools. The joining of these small pools by a stream causes what is known as beaded \n\ndrainage (Figure 4). Such drainage evidences the presence of perennially frozen, fine-grained \n\nsediments cut by ice wedges (P\u00e9w\u00e9, 1979). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 3. Helicopter view from of the polygonal ground in the F6 camp on Lake Fryxell in Taylor Valley \n\n(McMurdo, Dry Valleys region, Antarctica) (Ball, 2010). \n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/science/polygonal-ground\n\n\n  \n\n9 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4. Tundra polygons and beaded drainage on the north slope in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, \n\nAlaska (Shaw, 2015). \n\n \n\n\u2022 Thermokarst \n\n \nThe thawing of permafrost creates thermokarst topography, an irregular surface containing \n\nmounds, sinkholes, caves, tunnels and steep-walled ravines resulting from the melting of \n\nground ice (P\u00e9w\u00e9, 1979).  \n\nThawed depressions filled with water are known as thermokarst lakes (Figure 5) and are \n\nwidespread in permafrost regions, especially in those underlain with permanently frozen silt. \n\nThey can appear on hillsides or even on hilltops and are good indicators of ice-rich permafrost \n\n(P\u00e9w\u00e9, 1979).  \n\n \n\n  \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5. Circular thermokarst lakes in peatlands, Hudson Bay Lowlands, \n\nManitoba. Natural Resources Canada (de Schutter, 2004). \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\u2022 Pingos \n\n \nOther landforms linked to permafrost are pingos, which are ice-cored circular or elliptical \n\nhills of frozen sediments or bedrock. Pingos can reach dimensions up to 60 m high and 450 m \n\nin diameter. They can occur in the continuous permafrost zone, especially in the tundra. They \n\nare much less outstanding in the forested area of the discontinuous permafrost zone. \n\nFrequently they are cracked on top with summit craters formed by thawing massive ice \n\n(Figure 6) (P\u00e9w\u00e9, 1979).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6. Open system pingo in upper Eskerdalen, 35 km east of Longyearbyen, Svalbard, Norway. Photo: \n\nHanne Christiansen (Ing\u00f3lfsson, 2008). \n\n \n\n\u2022 Patterned ground \n\nIntense and repeated freezing and thawing throughout the year produces small-scale patterned \n\nground. This phenomenon tends to stir and sort granular sediments, forming circles, stone \n\nnets, and polygons a few centimetres to 6 m in diameter (Figure 7) (P\u00e9w\u00e9, 1979). These \n\nfeatures require a cold climate besides a ground composed by some fine-grained soils \n\nand high water content, but they do not necessarily need to be underlained by permafrost. \n\nHowever, permafrost constitutes a non-permeable substrate that keeps the soil water content \n\navailable for freezing.  \n\n\n\n  \n\n11 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7. Sorted circles 2\u20133 m in diameter with gravel borders about 0.25 m high, Broggerhalvoya, NW \n\nSpitsbergen (Hallet, 2013). \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Solifluction  \n\nIn areas underlain by an impermeable layer of seasonal frozen ground, the active layer is often \n\nsaturated with water and becomes easily deformable. The progressive downslope movement \n\nof water saturated soil under the action of gravity and frost is called solifluction. This material \n\nmoves in a semifluid condition and results in lobe-like and sheet-like flows of soil on slopes. \n\nThe pattern formed on the ground because of this phenomenon is known as solifluction lobes \n\nand sheets (Figure 8). An outstanding feature of solifluction is the mass transport of material \n\nover low-angle slopes (P\u00e9w\u00e9, 1979). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 8. Solifluction lobes on the Ulu Peninsula, James Ross Island, Antarctica (Bethan, 2017). \n\n\n\n  \n\n12 \n\n \n\n1.3 Global and regional impacts of permafrost dynamics in a global \n\nwarming scenario \n\nPermafrost and its dynamics are important components of the cryosphere as well as the Earth \n\nsystem as a whole. These dynamics interact with ecosystems and climate on various spatial \n\nand temporal scales.  \n\nClimate change is expected to have considerable effects above and below ground climate \n\nbeing the main reason for the modifications of the structure and distribution of permafrost \n\n(Schaefer, 2014). The combination of complex permafrost-ecosystem-climate interactions in a \n\nwarming world could exacerbate the overall impacts of permafrost dynamics to the Earth \n\nsystem. The feedbacks resulting from these interactions range from local impacts on \n\necosystem processes, to complex influences on global scale biogeochemical cycling (Grosse \n\net al., 2016). \n\n1.3.1 GLOBAL IMPACTS OF PERMAFROST DYNAMICS \n\nGlobal concerns on permafrost dynamics are related with the Earth\u2019s carbon cycle. The most \n\nrecent studies investigating the permafrost carbon pool size estimate that 1035 Gt of carbon is \n\nstored in the frozen organic soil in the northern circumpolar permafrost region (Schuur, 2015). \n\nThe rest of Earth\u2019s biomes, excluding the Arctic and boreal regions, are thought to contain \n\naround 2,050 Gt carbon. This pool may cause climate impacts at the global scale upon thaw \n\nand mobilization (Schuur et al., 2015). This is, if permafrost thaws where carbon pools are \n\npresent, the stored carbon may be released in the form of carbon dioxide and methane, which \n\nare powerful greenhouse gases that would again contribute to an increased rate of warming \n\nconstituting a feedback loop (Schaefer, 2014). \n\nIn Antarctica, permafrost shows lower carbon content and its contribution to greenhouse gas \n\nfluxes is minor at a global scale (Turner et al., 2009). The contribution of Antarctic \n\npermafrost might have even the opposite effect than Arctic permafrost because recently \n\ndeglaciated terrain, or areas with a thickening active layer, may function in the intermediate to \n\nlong-term as carbon sinks due to increased biomass from colonization by new plant species \n\nand microbial communities (Vieira et al., 2010) \n\n\n\n  \n\n13 \n\n \n\n1.3.2 REGIONAL IMPACTS OF PERMAFROST DYNAMICS \n\nLocal and regional consequences of changes in permafrost dynamics vary from changes in the \n\necosystem\u2019s vegetation, fauna, hydrology and terrain, to costly infrastructural damages and \n\neconomic costs (Grosse et al., 2016).  \n\n\u2022 Ecosystem disturbances: vegetation, hydrology, and fauna.  \n\nPlant life can be supported only within the active layer since growth can occur only in \n\nsoil that is fully thawed for some part of the year. Therefore, plant growth and rooting \n\nzones are largely restricted to the active layer, since roots cannot penetrate the frozen \n\nground beneath (Ullrich, 2016). Because of this, the dominant ecosystems in \n\npermafrost regions are boreal forests and tundra. Sedges, shrubs, mosses and lichens \n\ndominate tundra vegetation while evergreen spruce, fir and pine, as well as the \n\ndeciduous larch or tamarack dominate boreal forests.  \n\nIn the Arctic, boreal forests occur in the southern regions and tundra up in the north \n\n(Schaefer et al., 2012). The tundra in Antarctica occurs mainly close to the coastline, \n\nwhile cold deserts occur in the mainland and at high altitude (Lopez-Terril, 2014). In \n\nmountainous permafrost regions, forests dominate at lower elevations and tundra at \n\nhigher elevations (Schaefer et al., 2012).  \n\nRegarding the hydrology and fauna in permafrost regions, permafrost is impermeable \n\nto water, so rain and melt water accumulate on the surface forming numerous lakes \n\nand wetlands. These lakes and wetlands are favourable to migratory birds from around \n\nthe world, which use them as summer breeding grounds (Schaefer et al., 2012). \n\nHowever, permafrost constitutes also limitations for fauna requiring subsurface \n\nhomes, as building dens and burrows in the frozen ground beneath the surface is often \n\nharsh. Other species dependent on plants and animals, such as bacteria, have their \n\nhabitat constrained by the permafrost as well. One gram of soil from the active layer \n\nmay include more than one billion bacteria cells. However, the number of bacteria in \n\npermafrost soil is much lower varying typically from 1 to 1000 million per gram of \n\nsoil (Hansen, 2017).  Permafrost degradation may disturb ecosystems and change \n\nspecies composition, modifying wildlife habitats and migration (Schaefer, 2012). \n\n\n\n  \n\n14 \n\n \n\nThe main ecosystem factor affected by degrading permafrost will be the local \n\nhydrology, which will suffer changes with wetlands and lakes forming in continuous \n\npermafrost and disappearing in discontinuous permafrost (Smith et al., 2005).  \n\n\u2022 Terrain disturbances: Topography and slope stability \n\nClimate change is expected to increase erosion rates along the Arctic and Antarctic \n\ncoastline (Schaefer, 2012). As much of the structural stability in mountain ranges can \n\nbe attributed to glaciers and permafrost, thawing permafrost in steep mountain terrain \n\nincreases the risk of rock falls and landslides (Harris et al. 2001). Talus and rock faces \n\ncemented together by ice in mountainous permafrost zones can form rock glaciers that \n\ncreep downhill at velocities of centimetres to several meters per year (Figure 9).  \n\n \n\nFigure 9. Rock and talus debris flowing downhill in a rock glacier near McCarthy, Alaska \n\n(photo: Isabelle G\u00e4rtner-Roer) (Schaefer et al., 2012). \n\n \n\nIf temperatures increase, ice on the permafrost will deform more easily of even thaw, \n\nresulting in an increase of collapse risk, landslides and rock glacier flow (Schaefer et \n\nal., 2012). \n\n \n\n\u2022 Infrastructure:  \n\nThawing permafrost is structurally weak, resulting in foundational settling that can \n\ndamage or even destroy infrastructure as buildings, roads, pipelines, railways, and \n\npower lines (Figure 10). Infrastructure failure can have dramatic environmental \n\nconsequences, as seen in the 1994 breakdown of the pipeline of the Vozei oilfield in \n\n\n\n  \n\n15 \n\n \n\nNorthern Russia, which resulted in a spill of 160,000 tons of oil, the world\u2019s largest \n\nterrestrial oil spill (Schaefer et al., 2012). \n\nPermafrost regions in the North Hemisphere are more vulnerable to damage as it \n\ncounts with more infrastructure and population than the South Hemisphere permafrost \n\nregions. However, the effect of climate change on subsidence on Antarctica is of \n\nmajor concern, particularly in coastal areas with abundant ground ice, since despite the \n\nsmall total area of infrastructure in Antarctica, financial investments are substantial \n\n(Vieira et al., 2010). \n\n         \n\nFigure 10. Irregular settling due to permafrost thaw destroyed this apartment building in Cherski, Siberia \n\n(photo: Vladimir Romanovsky, in Schaefer et al., 2012). \n\n \n\nThe impacts of the permafrost-ecosystem-climate feedbacks mentioned above have \n\nsignificantly raised the awareness for this component of Earth\u2019s cryosphere in the view of \n\nstakeholders, decision makers, and the public over the last few years (Grosse et al., 2016).  \n\nMoreover, although widespread changes to permafrost usually take centuries, the \n\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report estimates that \u201cby the mid-21st \n\ncentury the Arctic and alpine air temperatures will increase at roughly twice the global rate \n\nand the area of permafrost in the Northern Hemisphere will decline by 20-35%\u201d (IPCC, \n\n2007). Additionally, the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP, 2012) suggests \n\nthe depth of thawing could increase by 30-50% by the year 2080.  \n\nIn recognition of this importance, permafrost has been added as an Essential Climate Variable \n\n(ECV) in the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) of the World Meteorological \n\n\n\n  \n\n16 \n\n \n\nOrganization (WMO). Consequently, permafrost now requires broad-scale research and \n\nsystematic observations to support the IPCC and United Nations Framework Convention on \n\nClimate Change (UNFCC) in their assessments of the state of the global climate system and \n\nits variability (Grosse et al., 2016).  \n\n \n\nTo understand the status and dynamics of permafrost, the monitoring of ground temperature \n\nand active layer thickness are needed. Other observations include sample drilling, remote \n\nsensing to detect changes in land surface characteristics and measurements of surface \n\nsubsidence or heave (Schaefer et al., 2012). \n\n  \n\n1.4 Global Permafrost Monitoring \n\n \n\nThe creation of national permafrost monitoring networks was considered by the IPCC as one \n\nof the key steps to understand the potential impacts of permafrost dynamics in a climate-\n\nchanging world affected by global warming (Grosse et al., 2016). \n\nCurrently, there are two global networks to monitor permafrost: the Thermal State of \n\nPermafrost (TSP) network, which coordinates measurements of permafrost temperature; and \n\nthe Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) network, which coordinates \n\nmeasurements of active layer thickness in both polar regions as shown in Figure 11. \n\n\n\n  \n\n17 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11. Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) network and Thermal State of Permafrost (TSP) \n\nnetwork distribution (Schaefer, 2014). \n\nThe TSP and CALM networks are the two components of the Global Terrestrial Network for \n\nPermafrost (GTN-P). The GTN-P was initiated by the International Permafrost Association \n\n(IPA) to organize and manage a global network of permafrost observations for detecting, \n\nmonitoring and predicting climate change, and was implemented under the GCOS and its \n\nassociated organizations. The IPA currently coordinates international development and \n\noperation of the TSP and CALM networks for the GTN-P (Schaefer et al., 2012). \n\nThe TSP network measures permafrost temperature using boreholes. Boreholes vary in depth \n\nfrom a few meters to a hundred meters and deeper, with a string of temperature sensors at \n\nmultiple depths. Newer boreholes are automated, but manually lowering a single sensor probe \n\ndown a borehole to measure temperature is still common. The oldest boreholes have operated \n\nsince the middle of the 20th century, with several decades of permafrost temperature \n\nobservations. The TSP network includes approximately 1357 boreholes mostly located in the \n\nArctic, also includes boreholes in the European Alps, Antarctica and the Qinghai-Tibetan \n\nPlateau (GNT-P, 2018). \n\nThe CALM network measures active layer thickness or maximum annual thaw either \n\nmechanically using a probe, or electronically with a vertical sequence of temperature sensors. \n\nThe probe is a metal rod sunk into the ground until it hits the hard top of permafrost. The \n\nactive layer depth is measured on the rod and recorded. To account for high spatial variability, \n\n\n\n  \n\n18 \n\n \n\nresearchers generally probe the active layer on a specified 1 km or 100 m grid. A 252-sites \n\nnetwork presently exists under the CALM Network (GNT-P, 2018), some of which have been \n\nmeasuring active layer thickness since the 1990s (Schaefer et al., 2012).  \n\nMost stations in TSP and CALM are nationally or regionally funded and operated by \n\nindependent research teams. TSP and CALM coverage are limited because installation and \n\nmaintenance costs restrict sites to regions with reasonable access by truck, plane or boat. The \n\nresearch teams in the GTN-P have made tremendous progress, but evaluation of overall \n\npermafrost status in a region or country is still very difficult because of the non-standard \n\nobservations and limited coverage of the TSP and CALM networks, due to a limited and \n\nirregular funding (Schaefer et al., 2012). Moreover, international collaboration on data \n\ncollection and analysis is still a great challenge to overcome in this advancing scientific \n\nproblem of global concern. The willingness of scientists to share data and to participate in \n\ndata management strategies is as well a crucial requirement for scientific advancement \n\n(Papale et al., 2012) \n\nSpecially during the International Polar Year (IPY) in 2007-08, the Antarctic region received \n\ngreat efforts to increase the spatial coverage of the existing permafrost-monitoring network \n\nand installing boreholes deeper than the depth of ZAA (Figure 12) all around the continent \n\n(Vieira et al., 2010). About 350 new boreholes for temperature monitoring were established \n\nglobally and a considerable number of active layer depth observations were collected during \n\nthis year (Biskaborn et al., 2015). Meteorological stations were as well installed close to some \n\nboreholes in order to evaluate ground\u2013atmosphere coupling (Vieira et al., 2010).  \n\nEfforts of the IPA and the GTN- P at the end of the IPY resulted in reports on the thermal \n\nstate of permafrost in high latitudes and high altitudes which were called the \u201cIPA snapshot\u201d \n\nand published in a special issue of the journal Permafrost and Periglacial Processes \n\n(Christiansen et al., 2010; Romanovsky et al., 2010a; Smith et al., 2010; Vieira et al., 2010; \n\nZhao et al., 2010). \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n19 \n\n \n\n \n\n1.5 Permafrost in Antarctica \n\nAntarctica, with an area of 14 million km2, is the world\u2019s largest continent, yet exposed \n\nground on which permafrost soils occur covers a mere 49,000 km2 (Fox and Cooper, 1994 in \n\nCampbell &amp; Claridge, 2009).  Despite occupying only 0.36% of the Antarctic region, \n\npermafrost is present beneath virtually all ice-free terrain, such as the Antarctic Peninsula and \n\nthe Transantarctic Mountains, except at the lowest elevations of the maritime Antarctic and \n\nsub-Antarctic islands (Vieira et al., 2010). \n\n \n\nExisting studies on permafrost and active-layer dynamics in Antarctica were summarized in \n\nVieira et al. (2010). However, in the last years, the Antarctic Peninsula has been the ice-free \n\nregion receiving greater permafrost research interest as is one of the areas of the currently \n\naffected by the greatest air warming (Guglielmin, 2011). \n\n \n\n1.5.1 CLIMATE, ECOSYSTEM AND SENSITIVITY TO CHANGE \n\nThe climate of Antarctica embraces the most extreme cold conditions on Earth. Whereas the \n\nclimate is oceanic in the coastal areas of West Antarctica, it is continental in Central and East \n\nAntarctica. As a rule, temperatures decrease with distance inland. The average winter \n\nFigure 12. a) Antarctic permafrost monitoring boreholes (pre-and IPY installation) in relation to soil regions \n\naccording to Greene et al. (1997): 1. Queen Maud Land; 2. Enderby Land; 3. Vestford Hills; 4. Wilkes Land; 5a \n\nnd b. Transantarctic Mountains; 6. Ellsworth Mountains; 7. Marie Byrd Land; 8. Antarctic Peninsula; \n\nb) Antarctic Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring Network (CALM). New sites installed during the IPY are \n\nunderlined (Vieira et al. 2010). \n\n \n\na) b) \n\n\n\n  \n\n20 \n\n \n\ntemperatures range around -20\u00b0C and -30\u00b0C along the coasts and -60\u00b0C to -70\u00b0C inland on the \n\ncontinent (Umweltbundesamt, 2016). The lowest temperature recorded on site (-89.6\u00b0C) was \n\nmeasured at the Russian research station Vostok in eastern Antarctica in 1983 (Campbell &amp; \n\nClaridge, 2009).  \n\nThe mean annual precipitation over Antarctica averages around 50 mm per year, with less \n\nfalling inland and most in coastal locations. The precipitation normally falls as snow, and \n\nlittle is available for direct soil moistening in the continental part of Antarctica because of \n\nablation and evaporation (Campbell &amp; Claridge, 2009). \n\n \n\nRegarding the ecosystem, the soils in Antarctica have been referred as \u201cCold Desert Soils\u201d \n\n(Campbell and Claridge, 1969), with the exception of the ice-free areas of the Antarctic \n\nPeninsula, where plant life including lichens, mosses and some grasses are more abundant. \n\nBiodiversity inland in the continent is extremely low, and diminishes with increasing severity \n\nof climatic conditions. The occurrence of terrestrial biota is sporadic, being found only in very \n\nsmall areas where there is enough water, light and warmth, as well as shelter from the wind.  \n\n \n\nTerrestrial ecosystems in this harsh environment are extremely fragile. A review of the \n\nimpacts of human activities and the susceptibility of the land systems to disturbance was \n\ncarried out for the Ross Sea region (Campbell, 2001), and showed that disturbances from \n\nhuman activities are long-lasting. Physical disturbances to the soils could be persistent for \n\nhundreds of years, or in the most arid zones (where recovery processes are negligible), could \n\neven be permanent. Chemical contaminations may also persist in the absence of significant \n\nleaching. Permafrost is equally dramatically and rapidly disturbed when physical disturbance \n\ntakes place. Less clear, however, are the future impacts of global climate change. From the \n\n1950\u2019s until 1999, a distinct warming trend was observed in the Antarctic Peninsula region, \n\nwhile recent data reports a cooling trend in the North of this peninsula and the East Antarctic \n\nregion since then (Turner et al., 2016; Campbell and Claridge, 2006). \n\n \n\n1.5.2 PERMAFROST DISTRIBUTION \n\nPermafrost research in Antarctica has been increasing significantly since Bockheim (1995) \n\ndeveloped the first permafrost map of Antarctica (Figure 13), proposing that discontinuous \n\nand continuous permafrost boundaries correspond to mean annual air temperatures of ?1\u00b0C \n\nand ?8\u00b0C, respectively. \n\n\n\n  \n\n21 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe permafrost table is at greatest depth in the warmer west and northern regions of \n\nAntarctica, and diminishes in depth inland with increasing latitude and altitude. However, the \n\ndepth of the permafrost table also varies from site to site at small scales because of the local \n\ndifferences in the substrate type and in the exposition to solar radiation that varies with \n\ntopographic shading, aspect, snow cover, surface colour and roughness (Campbell and \n\nClaridge, 2009). \n\n \n\nLater on, results obtained during the IPY on the thermal state of permafrost and the active \n\nlayer in the WAP showed the South Shetland Islands near sea-level region, as an area near the \n\nclimatic boundary of permafrost. Permafrost temperatures range from ?0.4 to ?3.1\u00b0C along \n\nthe WAP, where the greatest rate of warming (ca. 2.4\u20133.4 \u00b0C) has occurred from 1950 to 2000 \n\n(Bockheim et al., 2013). Therefore, the WAP was reported as the one with the highest \n\nsensitivity to climate change in the Antarctic continent (Vieira et al., 2010).  \n\nFigure 13. General permafrost distribution map in the Antarctic (modified from Bockheim, 1995). \n\n\n\n  \n\n22 \n\n \n\nPermafrost temperatures were much lower in continental Antarctica: from the coast to the \n\ninterior and with increasing elevation, they ranged between -13.4 \u00baC and -18.7 \u00baC in Northern \n\nVictoria Land, from -17.5 \u00baC to -22.6 \u00baC in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, and down to -23.7 \u00baC \n\nin high elevation on Mount Fleming (Ross Island). The snapshot obtained during the IPY \n\nshows that the range of ground temperatures in the Antarctic is even greater than in the Arctic \n\n(Vieira et al., 2010). \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n23 \n\n \n\n1.5.3 RELEVANCE OF PERMAFROST RESEARCH IN WESTERN ANTARCTIC \n\nPENINSULA: A REVIEW.  \n\nDespite the Transantarctic Mountains being the ice-free region of the Antarctic where \n\nsystematic permafrost research has been conducted for the longest time, it was the Antarctic \n\nPeninsula region receiving greater permafrost research interest and efforts during the IPY in \n\n2007-08 (Vieira et al., 2010). \n\nThe reason is because, the WAP was considered as \u201cone of the areas of the world currently \n\naffected by the greatest air warming and provides a unique opportunity to understand the \n\nimpacts of climate change on permafrost and its related ecosystems\u201d (Guglielmin, 2011). \n\n \n\nAlong the WAP, the mean annual air temperature showed an increment of around 3.4 \u00b0C \n\nduring the second half of the 20th century, making the region one of the world's climate \n\nwarming \u201chotspots\u201d (Vaughan et al., 2003; Turner et al., 2005, 2009). These changes in \n\nclimate were possibly linked to shifts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to the south \n\n(B\u00f6ning et al., 2008), which resulted in a 40% decrement in sea-ice coverage in the \n\nBellingshausen Sea (Ducklow et al., 2008; Stammerjohn et al., 2008) and in the disintegration \n\nof ice shelves along the WAP (Cook and Vaughan, 2010). \n\nHowever, more recent studies (Turner et al., 2016) found that the warming signal is more \n\ncomplex than previously accounted and report a cooling in the north of the Antarctic \n\nPeninsula since 2000.  \n\nThe complexity of the reaction in this region to climate change is still poorly understood. \n\nPermafrost properties and seasonal thaw-layer dynamics are considered two key indicators of \n\nclimate change in the polar region (Anisimov et al., 1997; Burgess et al., 2000). Therefore, in \n\norder to evaluate the consequences of climate change in the terrestrial environments \n\ndominated by the presence of permafrost in the WAP, permafrost and active layer dynamics \n\nmonitoring and modelling is essential. \n\n \n\nOn one hand, monitoring is possible though the TSP and CALM network of permafrost \n\ntemperature and active layer monitoring sites set up in some areas of the WAP.  \n\nEspecially during the IPY, several national projects focused their efforts in the Antarctic \n\nPeninsula and led to the installation of new boreholes (see Figure 14a): two intermediate, one \n\nshallow, 11 surface and 25 under 2m deep ground temperature boreholes. These included \n\nactivities by Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Italy, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Switzerland and the \n\n\n\n  \n\n24 \n\n \n\nUK (e.g. Ramos et al., 2009 a,b; Ramos and Vieira, 2009; Vieira et al., 2007, 2008, 2009; \n\nVieira 2009; de Pablo et al., 2010).  \n\n \n\n \n\nStill, during the last decade, after the IPY, the permafrost research activity has kept ongoing \n\nin the area and the number of boreholes has continued increasing. The data belonging to the \n\ntemperature monitoring in these boreholes has been used for the publication of several papers \n\non the characterization of the active layer dynamics and permafrost thermal state in the WAP, \n\nsuch as Hauck et al. (2007), Ramos and Vieira (2009), Vieira et al. (2010), Bockheim et al. \n\n(2013), de Pablo et al. (2014), Wilhelm &amp; Bockheim (2016), Ferreira et al. (2017), Ramos et \n\nal. (2017).   \n\nResults of these studies show that permafrost temperature ranges from ?0.4 to ?3.1 \u00b0C along \n\nthe western Antarctic Peninsula region and the warming rate between 1950 and 2000 ranged \n\naround 2.4\u20133.4 \u00b0C (Bockheim et al., 2013). This warming has resulted in the continuous \n\ndegradation of permafrost. For instance, reports prior to 1980 showed that permafrost was \n\npresent at a depth of 0.25 to 0.35 m in organic soils near Palmer Station (64\u00b046?S; 64\u00b004?W), \n\nbut currently, permafrost is absent or near thawing in the upper 14 m. In the South Shetland \n\nIslands, thawing of permafrost has resulted in increases in active-layer thicknesses and in \n\nthermokarst features such as debris flows and active-layer detachment slides. Several low-\n\nelevation boreholes show the presence of permafrost with temperatures close to 0 \u00baC, \n\nespecially beneath diamictons or in sedimentary materials. Such is the case at Bellingshausen, \n\nFigure 14. a) Permafrost monitoring boreholes installed in the Antarctic Peninsula during the IPY.  \n\nb) Active-layer thickness for selected boreholes. c) Mean ground surface and permafrost temperatures for \n\nselected boreholes (Vieira et al., 2010). \n\ncba\n\n\n\n  \n\n25 \n\n \n\nByers Peninsula or Crater Lake amongst others. On Deception Island, where the substratum is \n\nof volcano-sedimentary origin with extremely high insulation properties and ice-rich \n\npermafrost occurs almost down to sea level (Vieira et al., 2010).  \n\nBedrock temperatures from Hurd Peninsula (Livingston Island) suggest that the continuous \n\npermafrost boundary is probably at ca. 150 m a.s.l. (Vieira et al., 2009).  \n\nThe permafrost was found to be ice-cemented at high altitudes on the WAP. At low \n\nelevations, sporadic permafrost is especially unstable due to the disequilibrium of the frozen \n\nbodies with current climatic conditions (Bockheim et al., 2013). The lowest coastal terrain \n\nnear sea level is considered to be essentially permafrost free, but an altitudinal limit for \n\ncontinuous permafrost in bedrock has not been identified with confidence (Vieira et al., \n\n2010). Observed permafrost temperatures and active layer thickness in different points of the \n\nWAP are shown in Figure 14b and Figure 14c. \n\n \n\nIn spite of the monitoring expansion efforts and research interest in permafrost in the WAP \n\nduring the last years, due to the scarce of monitoring boreholes in the remotest areas, \n\npermafrost and active layer dynamics in the WAP is still poorly understood and efforts and \n\nresearch here must keep going on to understand its relation with recent climate change. This \n\nclimate changes can have consequences for infrastructure, especially at the low elevations, \n\nwhere 25 scientific stations exist in the Antarctic Peninsula region. Warming may also have \n\nan impact in the sensitive ecosystems of maritime Antarctica (Bockheim et al., 2013). \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n26 \n\n \n\n2 Study Area  \n\nCierva Point (lat. 64\u00b010\u2019S, long. 60\u00b057\u2019W) is an ice-free peninsula about 1 km long in north \n\nto south direction and 1.5 km wide in east to west direction, mainly exposed to the north. The \n\npeninsula (Figure15) stands on the south side of Cierva Cove, located at the north end of \n\nHughes Bay in the Danco Coast of Western Antarctic Peninsula. The climate is cold oceanic, \n\nwith a mean annual air temperature of ci. -3 \u00b0C, being 4.3 \u00baC and -20 \u00baC the maxima and \n\nminima recorded from 2012 to 2018. The estimated annual precipitation ranges from 400 to \n\n1100 mm and winter snow depths can exceed 1 m. However, during the summer most of the \n\nsnow in glacier-free areas completely melts (Wilhelm, 2016b). As a result, some temporary \n\nponds form at mid-altitudes (Figure 15). \n\n \n\nThe area taken in consideration in this work is a small sector of the Cierva Point peninsula. It \n\ncovers an area of 0.65 km2, restricted to the ice-free terrain, excluding areas of permanent \n\nsnow accumulations and temporary ponds (Figure 16). \n\n \n\nPrimavera Base \n\nBA\u00cdA \n\nHUGHES \n\nCALETA \n\nCIERVA \n\n0      \n \n\nFigure 15.

Most of the peninsula is glacierized with rock outcrops occurring mostly close to \n\nsea-level on the north side of the peninsula or in its NW tip (Figure 15). Polished bedrock, \n\nstriations, and chatter marks on bedrock throughout the peninsula show the effects of glacial \n\nerosion on the ice-free areas (Wilhelm, 2016b), while at some locations, recent moraine \n\naccumulations occur. The northern and lowest elevation sector of Cierva Point is dominated \n\nby deposits of granite debris and boulders and peat areas covered by significant moss \n\n(Polytrichum strictum and Chorisodontium aciphyllum) accumulations up to 0.8 m deep \n\n(Wilhelm, 2016b).  \n\n \n\nMost deglaciated slopes are north facing showing high solar radiation inputs, especially \n\nduring the summer (Bockheim et al., 2013). Bedrock benches in the north slopes of Cierva \n\nPoint show the presence of unconsolidated materials with soils derived from bedrock \n\nweathering and from glacial deposits. Slopes vary from 0 to 20% on benches and from 30 to \n\n60% on bedrock cliffs (Wilhelm, 2016a).  \n\nFigure 16.

The northernmost area is mainly \n\nconstituted by granodiorites, the middle of the peninsula (uphill and to the south) is \n\ndominated by feldspar granites and the eastern side, along with the southern peaks, is \n\ndominated by basalts containing olivine and quartz (Wilhelm, 2016b). \n\n \n\nIn the NW area of the peninsula, at low elevation close to the shore, stands the Argentinian \n\nAntarctic Station \u201cPrimavera\u201d that supports scientific research (Figure 16) \n\nCierva Point is an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) within the Antarctic Treaty as it \n\nguests a large Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) colony, as well as different types of lichens \n\nand mosses. The lowest elevations of Cierva Point are characterized by ornithogenic soils due \n\nto penguin activity.   \n\n \n\nSeveral shallow boreholes (1.2-4.3 m) and a deep borehole (15 m) were drilled in Cierva \n\nPoint in 2012 by research teams from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the \n\nUniversity of Lisbon (CEG-IGOT) in order to monitor the ground temperature at different \n\ndepths. The existing data series from 2012 to 2018, which although discontinuous in some \n\nboreholes, allows for a very detailed analysis of the ground thermal regime and is an excellent \n\ndata set for modelling the thermal regime and permafrost in the area. \n\nThe borehole data for the period 2012-2014 has been analysed by Wilhelm (2016a) to \n\ncharacterize the thickness of the active layer and to model conductive energy transfer in \n\ndifferent soil types.  \n\n \n\nHowever, little is still known about the climate sensitivity linked to regional air and ground \n\nsurface warming in this area. The availability of longer more recent borehole data up to 2018 \n\npresents a good opportunity for modelling the thermal regime and permafrost distribution in \n\nthe region, being them considered as climatically sensitive variables used for determining the \n\npermafrost thermodynamics in the area and evaluate its impact on ecosystem processes. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n29 \n\n \n\n3. Methodology \n\nIn order to estimate the temperature and distribution of permafrost, different distribution \n\nmodels relying both in statistical and physical approaches have been applied so far in polar \n\nand mountain regions. Physical-based approaches (Ferreira et al., 2016) have assessed the \n\nTTOP model using freezing and thawing indexes, n-factors and thermal conductivity of the \n\nground, as factors representing ground-atmosphere interactions and providing a framework to \n\nunderstand the ground thermal regime and permafrost temperature distribution. Other \n\nmethods have been developed for determining the spatial distribution of permafrost using \n\nGIS-based empiric-statistical permafrost models (e.g. Etzelm\u00fcller et al., 2006). Such \n\nmodelling was calibrated with ground temperature observations, and used non-parametric \n\ncorrelations and logistic regression modelling to estimate the spatial permafrost probability \n\nbased on single independent variables (Lewkowicz and Ednie, 2004; Brenning et al., 2005). \n\nIn this investigation, the aforementioned studies, together with others mentioned along this \n\ndissertation, gave us the insights to create a methodology that allows increment the scarce \n\nexisting knowledge about the permafrost distribution and climate sensitivity of Cierva Point.  \n\n \n\nThe method followed to achieve the objectives of this investigation was divided in two main \n\nsteps.  \n\nInitially, the ground thermal regime of 9 sites with different ground characteristics and \n\ntopographical conditions was analysed. In these locations, ground and air temperature records \n\nwere available from 2012 to 2018, although with significant observational gaps. The ground \n\ntemperature records, taken every 4 hours, were obtained from thermistor strings in boreholes \n\nwith depths ranging from 1.2 m to 15 m. Air temperatures at 4-hour intervals, were measured \n\nfrom 7 air temperature sensors and a meteorological station located close to the boreholes. \n\nUsing the ground temperature records, the local ground thermal regime was analysed in the \n\ndifferent monitoring sites. This allowed to determine the inter-annual variability of the active \n\nlayer, the observed or estimated temperature and depth of the top permafrost and the ground \n\nthermal offset for each site. Subsequently, the analysis of the air and ground temperatures \n\nallowed determining the parameters needed to develop the TTOP model for the 9 borehole \n\nsites. \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n30 \n\n \n\nThe outputs of the local ground thermal regime and local parameters were subsequently used \n\ntogether with ground, topographic and spatial data as inputs to implement a GIS-based spatial \n\nTTOP model all over the study area using statistical relations between the inputs.  \n\nThe TTOP model predicts the mean annual ground temperature at the depth of the top of the \n\npermafrost, or the base of seasonal freezing if permafrost is absent, using relatively simple \n\nparameters representing key climate and terrain factors influencing the ground thermal regime \n\n(Way, 2016). \n\nThe ground and air temperature data used for the model were obtained from the in situ \n\nmeasurements aforementioned. The spatial data used for the elaboration of a digital surface \n\nmodel (DSM) that constitutes the base for the spatial modelling, comes from UAV aerial \n\nimagery and D-GPS control points collected in the field.  \n\nThe main software tools used for the development of this methodology were: Excel (for the \n\ndata and thermal regime analysis); SPSS Statistics (for statistical analysis); Pix4D Mapper \n\n(for the creation of the orthomosaic and DSM through aerial imagery); and ArcMap 10.4 (for \n\nthe spatial model implementation). \n\n \n\n3.1 Data Collection and analysis \n\n3.1.1 GROUND TEMPERATURE MONITORING \n\nThe ground temperature records, measured every 4 hours, were obtained from 9 thermistor \n\nstrings in boreholes with depths ranging from 1.2 to 15 m.  \n\nThe boreholes were drilled in the summer of 2012 by a field team of the Universities of \n\nWisconsin-Madison and Lisbon and spatially distributed over Cierva Point, as explained in  \n\nWilhelm &amp; Bockheim (2016). Sites were selected based on different geomorphic ground \n\nsettings. The descriptions of each site are summarized in Table 1 and their spatial distribution \n\nis shown in Figure 17.  \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn March 2012, strings containing miniature temperature loggers (iButton, Model DS1922L, \n\nMaxim Integrated, San Jose, CA) were placed inside the boreholes, cased in sealed, air-filled, \n\npvc pipes with an outer diameter of 5 cm. Temperature was recorded every four hours at the \n\ndepths indicated in Table 1. The iButton temperature sensors used in this study (Figure 18a) \n\nshow an accuracy of \u00b10.5 \u00b0C.  \n\nSite Name\nElevation \n\n(m)\n\nX coordinate \n\n(m)\n\nY coordinate \n\n(m)\nGround Type Substrate class\n\nMax Depth \n\n(m)\nThermistor depths (cm) Notes\n\nSite 1: \n\nPermafrost\n198 599632.3 2883337.6 Granite Bedrock 15\n\n20, 40, 80, 120,160, 200, 250, 300, 350, \n\n400, 500, 550, 600, 700, 800, 1000, \n\n1250, 1500\n\nPermafrost at 5 m\n\nSite 2: Summit 336 599836.5 2883057.0 Basalt Bedrock 1.8 5, 15, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180 No permafrost in the dataset\n\nSite 3: \n\nBelowSummit\n318 599721.2 2883083.3\n\nPigmatitic K-Spar \n\nGranite\nBedrock 1.8 5, 15, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180 No permafrost in the dataset\n\nSite 4: Saddle 290 599505.9 2883142.7 Gelifluction Lobe\nUnconsolidated \n\nSoil\n1.2 5, 15, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 No permafrost in the dataset\n\nSite 5: Moraine 166 600018.3 2883484.3 Glacial Moraine\nUnconsolidated \n\nSoil\n1.8 5, 15, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180 Permafrost at 1 m\n\nSite 6: Midslope 137 599883.8 2883588.9 Granodiorite Bedrock 1.4 5, 15, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140 No permafrost in the dataset\n\nSite 7: \n\nMossRock\n71 599279.4 2883872.4 Granodiorite Bedrock 1.8 5, 15, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180 No permafrost in the dataset\n\nSite 8: \n\nMossMoss\n71 599284.1 2883871.9\n\n40cm of moss with \n\npeat substrate over \n\ngranite\n\nPeat 1.8 5, 15, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180 Permafrost at 0.4 m\n\nSite 9: Lowdeep 43 599350.6 2884022.2 Granodiorite Bedrock 4.3\n5, 15, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, \n\n180, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 430\nNo permafrost in the dataset\n\nTable 1.

(Base image: Google Earth, resolution: 2.4m) \n\n\n\n  \n\n32 \n\n \n\nTemperatures in the shallow boreholes were recorded until February 2017, with data \n\ndownloaded and the loggers reset at the end of each summer between February and April. \n\nUnfortunately, the dataset over this period is not continuous, showing several gaps in different \n\nboreholes at various depths. In February 2017, the thermistors for all the shallow boreholes \n\nwere removed and the thermistors of the deepest borehole (Site1-Permafrost) were replaced \n\nwith a higher accuracy thermistor-chain (GeoPrecision, model M-log5W-DALLAS) (Figure \n\n18b), being this the only borehole recording ground temperatures up to March 2018.  \n\nThe GeoPrecision thermistors show a standard resolution of \u00b10.065 \u00baC and an accuracy of \n\n\u00b10.25 \u00baC. The sensors were calibrated in an ice-bath following manufacturer instructions and \n\nthe final accuracy was reduced to \u00b10.1 \u00baC. \n\n  \n\nBesides the higher resolution of these sensors, the main advantage of the replacement was the \n\npossibility of download the data via wifi communication with the thermistors using a \n\ncomputer without the necessity of annually extracting the sensors from the borehole, as well \n\nas the much higher capacity of the memory of the datalogger, allowing hourly measures for a \n\nperiod of 5-years and a much higher battery life, lasting up to 3 years without maintenance. \n\nWith these data, we computed and plotted the daily mean ground temperatures over the full \n\ndataset (Figure 19a). When analysing the mean daily ground temperatures to time curve, we \n\nobserved an abrupt change in Site1 records at all the depths after the thermistor\u2019s replacement \n\n(Figure 19b) in February of 2017. GeoPrecision thermistors were considered to give closer \n\nvalues to real temperatures, as they are more accurate than the iButtons. In order to normalize \n\nthe dataset and correct the abrupt difference in the temperature measurement from 2017, the \n\nshift value, which was similar at all depths, showing an average of -0.2 \u00baC, was subtracted to \n\nthe 2012-2017 data. Since the ibuttons had been replaced several times, without other shifts \n\nFigure 18. a) iButton ground/air thermistors. b) Ground temperature GeoPrecision thermistor strings. \n\na) b) \n\n\n\n  \n\n33 \n\n \n\ndetected, we assume that the error is due to smaller precision of the ibuttons when compared \n\nto the Geoprecision device. \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 19. a) Mean daily ground temperatures measured in Site 1-Permafrost borehole from 2012 to 2018. b) Differences \n\nin temperatures recorded after 18/Feb/17 thermistor replacement, from iButton to GeoPrecision. \n\na) \n\nb) \n\n\n\n  \n\n34 \n\n \n\nMoreover, the dataset was analysed in order to identify and clean outliers due to anomalies or \n\nsensor manipulation during the data downloading tasks, which were usually found only a few \n\ndays every year, between February and April. \n\n \n\nDaily ground temperatures and the gaps in the datasets for each borehole are shown in Figure \n\n20, evidencing the issues during the 6-year period from March 2012 to February 2018. For the \n\nanalysis, only the periods that included a complete thawing-freezing annual cycle with \n\ncontinuous records of air and ground temperatures for all the boreholes were used for the \n\nanalysis of the thermal regimes and TTOP modelling. \n\nA complete annual air freezing-thawing cycle was defined as per Lewkowicz et al. (2012), \n\nconsidering it as the period from the beginning of one year\u2019s autumn (March-April in the \n\nSouthern Hemisphere), when the mean daily air and surface temperatures drop durably below \n\n0 \u00baC (freezing period), to the end of next summer (next March-April), after the mean daily air \n\nand surface temperatures have been durably positive on the cumulative degree-day time \n\ncurves (thawing period). This ensures that the entire cold and warm season is captured in the \n\ncalculation. Dates for thawing and freezing cycles in our specific case study are designated \n\nlater on in next section 3.1.2. \n\n\n\n  \n\n35 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 20.

Note the different data gaps. \n\nSite6-Midslope \n\n\n\n  \n\n36 \n\n \n\n3.1.2 AIR TEMPERATURE MONITORING \n\nWithin a distance of approximately 2 m from each borehole, air and surface temperature \n\niButton miniloggers were installed to monitor temperatures at 8 sites (due to the short distance \n\nbetween boreholes 7 and 8, just one common air temperature logger was installed). The \n\ndistribution of air temperature miniloggers is represented in Figure 21. \n \n\n \n\nThe air temperature miniloggers were attached to a pole 1.5m above the surface within a solar \n\nshield as explained in Wilhelm &amp; Bockheim (2016) and recorded almost continuous data \n\nfrom 09/03/2012 to 10/03/2014, when they were removed.  \n\nA meteorological station installed a few meters from the Site1-Permafrost borehole, recorded \n\nclimate data until 25/03/2018. The meteorological station is based in a Campbell Scientific \n\nCR1000 logger powered by a 12V, 155 amp/hour deep cycle battery and a 90W, 12V solar \n\npanel (BP590J, BP Solar). It has six instruments recording atmospheric conditions (Wilhelm \n\n&amp; Bockheim, 2016): an air temperature probe (109-L, Campbell Scientific), a relative \n\nhumidity probe (HMP-45C, Vaisala), a pyranometer (LI200X-L, LI-COR) which recorded \n\nsolar radiation, an anemometer (05103, R.M. Young) which recorded wind speed and \n\ndirection, and a tipping bucket rain gauge (TE525WS, Texas Electronics). In the end of the \n\nFigure 21. Air temperature miniloggers distribution in Cierva Point. (Base image: Google Earth, resolution: 2.4m). \n\n\n\n  \n\n37 \n\n \n\nsummer (between late February and early April) of each season, thermistor data were \n\ndownloaded and the loggers reset.  \n\nThe dataset for all the sites was explored in order identify and omit main outliner values due \n\nto sensor manipulation during the data downloading tasks (usually few days every year \n\nbetween February and April). Mean daily air temperature (MDAT) fluctuations and available \n\ndata for each site after the data exploration and correction are shown in Figure 22. \n\n \n\nAs observed in Figure 22, the dataset for the entire sites except of Site1 is limited to the \n\nperiod from March 2012 to March 2014. \n \n\nThe periods determined as complete freezing-thawing annual cycles between 2012 and 2018 \n\nare shown in the PERIOD column of Table 2. However, only years 1 and 2, which are the \n\ncycles having complete ground and air temperature records (green tick, grey coloured) were \n\nused for the analysis of the thermal regime and TTOP modelling.  \n\nIn site 6, ground temperature records for year 2 are missing, as an exception, only year1\u2019s \n\ndataset will be used in this site for the computation of the thermal regime and TTOP \n\nmodelling. \n\n \n\nFigure 22.

Consequently, we built up a Digital Surface Model (DSM) of the area to \n\nconstitute the base for the spatial modelling. UAV aerial imagery and D-GPS ground control \n\npoints collected in the field were processed using Pix4D Mapper software to create a DSM \n\nand an orthomosaic. \n\nIn late March 2018, we performed seven UAV flights over the study area using a DJI-\n\nPhantom 3 Advanced drone. The flights were carried out at altitudes between 200 and 380 \n\nmeters above the sea level and following the flight plans shown in Figure 23, using the \n\nAndroid app Pix4Dcapture. The flights provided 1792 aerial images in .jpeg format, with an \n\n80% overlap, taken by a DJI-FC300S (RGB) camera covering around the 90% of the desired \n\narea. Some examples of images captured during the flights and are shown in Figure 24. \n\nUnfortunately, due to a UAV malfunction which led to the loss of the UAV, a small area was \n\nnot surveyed. \n\n \n\nTable 2. Availability of air and ground temperature dataset over the full thawing and freezing cycles from 2012 to 2018. \n\nYears 1 and 2 are the only thawing and freezing cycles with a complete dataset for both air and ground temperatures (green \n\nchecks, grey shaded).

Example of images taken by the DJI-FC300S (RGB) in Cierva Point using the Phantom 3  \n\nAdvanced UAV. \n\n\n\n  \n\n40 \n\n \n\nThese images were processed in Pix4D Mapper for the construction of a high-resolution \n\nmosaic (i.e. assemblymen of all the images acquired over the area into a single georeferenced \n\n2D/3D model by computing automated approaches to detect the same features on adjacent \n\nimages).  \n\nIn order to improve the geometry and accuracy of the final model, we developed a \n\ngeorectification process previous to the mosaic implementation, still in Pix4D. In this process, \n\nthe coordinates of 18 D-GPS control points collected on singular geographical features on the \n\nterrain were introduced in the software and were manually associated to the exact related \n\npixel point on the images. The ground control points were collected using a D-GPS Trimble \n\nequipment constituted by a GPS rover and receiver Trimble R4 GNSS (in RTK mode) and a \n\ncontroller Trimble JUNO T41 Handheld. \n\nThe final Pix4D outputs after the georeferencing and processing were a very high-resolution \n\nortophotomosaic and a DSM covering a total land area of 1.063 km2 with a resolution of 6.51 \n\ncm and a mean RMS error of 0.665 m (Figure 25a and b). This RMS error reflects the steep \n\nslope in such a small area and also limitations associated to the different flight altitudes, \n\nwhich originated problems in the DSM reconstruction. \n\nThe raw mosaic and DSM created in Pix4D were afterwards processed in ArcMap 10.4 in \n\norder to clip them to the restricted area of study of 0.65km2 (avoiding permanent snow cover \n\nand ponds as shown in Figure 16) and to improve visualization (Figures 26a and b).

Then these values were plotted in a ground \n\ntemperature to depth graphs to determine each borehole\u2019s thermal \u201ctrumpet profile\u201d as \n\nexemplified in Figure 27.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWhen estimating each borehole\u2019s ground trumpet profile, one must account for that the \n\nMAGT profile is not strictly linear but is offset to progressively lower values at depth within \n\nthe active layer (Goodrich, 1978). Therefore, the best-fit to the observed data for the MAGT \n\nwas not estimated as a strictly linear function but by adjusting the best curve to the observed \n\ndata. \n\n \n\nFigure 27. Ground temperature to depth plot of the maximum (red), mean (green) and \n\nminimum (blue) annual ground temperatures constituting a borehole\u2019s \u201ctrumpet profile\u201d. \n\n\n\n  \n\n45 \n\n \n\nOn the other hand, MinAGT and MaxAGT values, respectively increase or decrease with \n\ndepth, following a non-linear function (Figure 2). Eventually, the ground temperature reaches \n\nthe equilibrium and becomes seasonally invariable below the ZAA point. At this depth, \n\nknown as \u201cdepth of zero annual amplitude\u201d, values for MinGAT, MaxGAT and MAGT are \n\nconsidered infinitesimally equal (P\u00e9w\u00e9, 2016). \n\n \n\nConsidering the behaviour explained above, the MinAGT and MaxAGT functions were \n\napproximated by minimum least square polynomial regressions. We have individually \n\nselected the most suitable polynomial degree of regressions for MinGAT and MaxGAT in \n\nterms of two facts: the regression curve with the highest value of local adjustment to the \n\nobserved range of data (higher R\u00b2 values); and the regression curves whose trend tends to \n\ncross together with MAGT at a common ZAA point. Values for local residuals, standard error \n\nand R\u00b2 of each estimation were determined as well.  \n\n \n\nFor the boreholes where the depth of observations does not allow plotting the complete \n\nthermal regime\u2019s trumpet profile until reaching the Top of Permafrost (sites 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and \n\n9), the thermal profile was estimated down to the ZAA point by adjusting the most suitable \n\nleast-squares regression curves to the available extent of the observed data. \n\n \n\nIt is important to highlight that the regression curves for MinGAT and MaxGAT parameters \n\nshould just be considered as good estimators locally, at lower depths than the ZAA depth. \n\nBelow this depth, the temperature of permafrost becomes seasonally invariable (Delisle, \n\n2007) and increases steadily with depth following the MAGT tendency until reaching the base \n\nof permafrost (0 \u00baC) (P\u00e9w\u00e9, 1979).  \n\n \n\nOnce we had the graphs of all site\u2019s ground thermal profiles, we determined the observed \n\nvalues (sites 1, 5 and 8) and the estimated by curve adjustment values (sites 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9) \n\nof the following parameters: depth of the Top of Permafrost (depth value when MaxGAT = 0 \n\n\u00baC), Temperature at the Top of Permafrost (MAGT at the depth when MaxGAT = 0 \u00baC), depth \n\nand temperature at the ZAA point (depth and MAGT values when the three functions cross \n\ntogether), Mean Annual Ground Surface Temperature (MAGST), and the active layer\u2019s \n\nthermal offset (computed as the difference between TTOP and MAGST (Burn and Smith, \n\n1988).  \n\n\n\n  \n\n46 \n\n \n\nThe ground surface temperature is a key parameter for the calculation of the MAGST and \n\nthus, for the calculation of the thermal offset as well. However, often ground surface \n\ntemperature is not easy to measure due to the radiative and convective energy flows at the \n\nsurface and difficulty in keeping the sensor in the same position. Because of these difficulties, \n\nnominal surface temperature measurements are often taken a few centimetres below the \n\nsurface (Riseborough, 2003). In this work, because no data was available on temperature at \n\nthe surface to empirically determine MAGST values for each borehole, corresponding values \n\nare based on data measured at 5 cm depth under the ground surface (i.e. the depth of the \n\nshallowest thermistor in all the boreholes). \n\n \n\n3.3 TTOP Model implementation \n\nOnce analysed the ground temperature regimes profiles for the 9 specific locations, the next \n\nstep was the implementation of the TTOP model. \n\nThe TTOP model predicts the mean annual ground temperature at the depth of the top of the \n\npermafrost, or at the base of the seasonal freezing and thawing layer, if permafrost is absent, \n\nusing relatively simple parameters representing key climate and terrain factors influencing the \n\nground thermal regime (Way, 2016).  \n\n \n\nThe TTOP model was first computed and validated for the 9 locations, where observational \n\ntemperature data is available. In a second stage, we spatialized the model all over the area of \n\ninterest using statistical relations between topographic factors and the previously computed \n\nlocal TTOP model parameters, in a GIS-based environment.  \n\n \n\n3.3.1 TTOP MODEL\u2019S THEORY \n\nThe TTOP model was developed by Smith &amp; Riseborough (1996) to estimate the equilibrium \n\ntemperature at the top of the permafrost at local or regional spatial scales. It constitutes a \n\nfunctional model of the relationship between permafrost and climate. It accommodates the \n\ngeographical variations of climatic, surface and soil factors controlling the ground thermal \n\nregime and is a useful tool to analyse the impacts of climate change on ground temperatures \n\n(Smith &amp; Riseborough, 1996). \n\n \n\nAnalysing the responses of permafrost to climate requires an appropriate characterization of \n\nthe permafrost-climate system. Following Lachenbruch et al. (1988), the permafrost-climate \n\n\n\n  \n\n47 \n\n \n\nrelationship can be depicted by the temperature regime at four levels: (1) the temperature at \n\nstandard screen height; (2) the temperature at the snow surface; (3) the temperature at the \n\nground surface; (4) the temperature at the top of permafrost. \n\nDifferences in mean temperature values at each of these levels are due to the variation trough \n\ntime of heat transfer coefficients with temperatures through the different layers of the system. \n\nIn the lower atmosphere, turbulent transfer varies diurnally and seasonally between stable and \n\nunstable conditions. Heat conduction at ground level varies between frozen and thawed states. \n\nThe presence or absence of the snow cover determines if heat transfer right above the ground \n\nsurface is predominantly conductive or convective. Heat transfer processes occurring at this \n\ninterface and within the buffer layer are complex, implicating radiative influxes, turbulence, \n\nconduction, evaporation, and transpiration of living vegetation (Smith &amp; Riseborough, 1996). \n\n \n\nThe TTOP model uses the temperature regime at the top of permafrost (state 4) as the best \n\nlevel to study the climate-permafrost linkages, relating ground temperatures to the annual \n\ncycle of atmospheric temperatures. Between ground and atmospheric temperatures, the model \n\ntakes into account the effects of local soil properties and surface conditions such as vegetation \n\nand snow cover, being the first considered as the greatest local influence on permafrost \n\ntemperatures followed by the surface snow cover and vegetation (Smith &amp; Riseborough, \n\n1996). \n\n \n\nTherefore, the TTOP model predicts the mean annual ground temperature at the depth of the \n\ntop of the permafrost, or the base of seasonal freezing and thawing layer if permafrost is \n\nabsent, using parameters representing climate, surface and lithological factors that have \n\ninfluence in the ground thermal regime (Smith and Riseborough 1996, Way &amp; Lewkowicz, \n\n2016).  \n\nThese parameters include the air freezing and thawing indexes, air-ground temperature \n\nfunctions (n-factors) and the ratio of freezing to thawing thermal conductivities that account \n\nfor the ground thermal offset (Burn &amp; Smith 1988; Smith &amp; Riseborough 1996, 2002; \n\nKarunaratne &amp; Burn, 2003; Bevington &amp; Lewkowicz 2015). N-factors provide a simplified \n\nrepresentation of the influence of the surface buffer layer in modulating heat exchange \n\nbetween the atmosphere and the ground surface (Way et al., 2016). \n\nThe standard formulation of the TTOP model as a function of all these parameters is \n\nexpressed below in Equation 1a (Smith &amp; Riseborough, 1996).  \n\n\n\n  \n\n48 \n\n \n\nSecondary relations between the model\u2019s parameters shown in Equation1b were applied to the \n\nmain TTOP formula in order to give a simplified expression for the model (Equation 2) that \n\nwas later used on in this work.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWhere:  \n\nTtop= Temperature at the top of permafrost (\u00baC) \n\nKt= Thermal condictivity of thawed ground (W/mK) \n\nKf= Thermal conductivity of frozen ground (W/mK) \n\nIta=Cumulative air thawing degree days (\u00baCdia) \n\nIfa=Cumulative air freezing degree days (\u00baCdia) \n\nIts=Cumulative surface thawing degree days (\u00baCdia) \n\nIfs=Cumulative air surface degree days (\u00baCdia) \n\nNt= Scaling factor between air and surface thawing index  \n\nNf= Scaling factor between air and Surface freezing index \n\nToffset= Temperature difference between the TTOP and the ground surface (\u00baC) (Burn &amp; \n\nSmith, 1988) \n\nP= Complete period for a whole thawing-freezing cycle (typically around 365 days) \n\n \n\nEquation 1. a) TTOP model equation as a function of air freezing and thawing indexes, n-factors and the ratio of \n\nthawed to frozen conductivities. b) TTOP parameters as a function of secondary parameters. \n\n???? =\n\n(\n??\n??\n\n ?? ??? ?  ?? ???)\n\n?\n \n\n?? =\n??? \n\n???\n \n\n?? =\n??? \n\n???\n \n\n??\n??\n\n= ???????\n?\n\n???\n+ 1 \n\n(Romanovsky &amp; Osterkamp, 1995) \n\n(Smith &amp; Riseborough, 1996) \n\n \n\n(Smith &amp; Riseborough, 1996) \n\n \n\na) \n\nb) \n\n???? =\n(?????? ?????)\n\n?\n+  ???????   \n\nEquation 2. a) TTOP model equation as a function of air freezing and thawing indexes, n-factors and the \n\nseasonal thawing layer\u2019s thermal offset (Way et al., 2016). \n\n(Smith &amp; Riseborough, 1996) \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n49 \n\n \n\nNote that, considering the relation of n-factors with Its and Ifs exposed above (nt=Its/Ita; \n\nnf=IfsIifa), the expression (ntIta-nfIfa)/365 represents the mean annual ground surface \n\ntemperature (Smith &amp; Riseborough, 1996) and Equation 2 could also be expressed as the \n\nfollowing Equation 3:  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3.2 LOCAL COMPUTATION OF THE TTOP MODEL \n\nFirst, the TTOP model and its parameters were computed for the 9 monitoring sites where \n\nempirical data is available. Then, we evaluated the adjustment of the results given by the \n\nTTOP model formula to the TTOP values previously estimated or observed in each location \n\nusing the results given by the trumpet profile\u2019s analysis in Section 3.2. \n\n \n\n3.3.2.1 Freezing and thawing air degree days \n\nAir freezing degree-days (If) or air thawing degree-days (It) are defined as departures of air \n\ntemperature from 0 \u00baC.  This index, also known as freezing or thawing index, is a measure of \n\nboth duration and magnitude of below-freezing (or above-thawing) temperatures during a \n\nspecified period. Therefore, the cumulative values of If or It for a given whole freezing-\n\nthawing cycle gives insights about how cold or warm it has been the winter (freezing) or \n\nsummer (thawing) season and for how long (Maslanik &amp; Yu, 2010). \n\n \n\nAs summarized in Frauenfeld et al. (2007), there are different ways to calculate the air \n\nfreezing and thawing indexes in the literature. Huschke (1959) proposed the concept of a \n\nseasonal freezing and thawing index, which stayed as the present definition of \n\nfreezing/thawing indexes given by the American Meteorological Society\u2019s (AMS). The \n\nseasonal freezing index is computed in a particular site as the sum of all negative and positive \n\ndaily air temperatures between the highest point, in autumn, and the lowest point, the next \n\nspring, on the cumulative degree-day time curve. In the same way, the seasonal thawing index \n\nis calculated as the arithmetic summation of all positive and negative mean daily air \n\ntemperature at a specific site along the period from the spring until the next autumn. \n\n \n\n???? =\n(??? ?  ???)\n\n?\n+  ??????? = ????? + ??????? \n\nEquation 3. TTOP as a function of mean annual ground temperature and the thermal offset. \n\n\n\n  \n\n50 \n\n \n\nHarris (1981) determined the total annual freezing and thawing index, which is estimated as \n\nthe respective sum of all negative or positive mean daily air temperatures during a calendar \n\nyear. Nonetheless, this definition is debatable since the freezing index computed over a \n\ncalendar year does not include a complete cold season.   \n\nFor this investigation, we computed the annual freezing and thawing indexes as the area \n\nfalling behead the sinusoidal curve (or integrated mean daily temperatures), for all days with \n\ntemperatures below or above 0 \u00b0C, respectively, during a complete freezing/thawing natural \n\ncycle period (equation 4a). Empirically, this freezing and thawing indexes can be simplified \n\nas the absolute summation of the mean daily air temperatures for all days with temperatures \n\nbelow freezing (If) or above thawing (It) during a complete freezing/thawing cycle (Equation \n\n4b) (Frauenfeld et al., 2007).  \n\nThe annual freezing and thawing complete cycles over our dataset were defined in the \n\nPERIOD column of Table 2 (in Section 3.1.2) and go from the beginning of one year\u2019s \n\nautumn (around March) to the end of the next year\u2019s summer (around March next year), \n\nincluding both complete freezing and thawing periods. However, only the air temperatures of \n\nyear 1 and 2, which have continuous air and ground temperature records during the total cycle \n\n(green tick, grey coloured), were used for the estimation of the Ita and Ifa parameters in this \n\nwork.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWhere:  \n\nIfa =air freezing index \n\nIta= air thawing index \n\nTa= mean daily air temperature, integrated from the beginning of the autumn (t0) to the end \n\nof the next summer (t2) in the freezing/thawing cycle.  \n\nNf= Number of days with temperatures below 0 \u00baC over the whole freezing-thawing period. \n\nNt= Number of days with temperatures above 0 \u00baC over the whole freezing-thawing period. \n\n??? = ? |??|\n?2\n\n?0\n\n??,   ?? &lt;0\u00ba? ??? = ? |???|\n\n??\n\n?\n\n, ??? &lt;0\u00ba? \n\n??? = ? |??|\n?2\n\n?0\n\n??,   ?? > 0\u00ba? ??? = ? |???|\n\n??\n\n?\n\n, ??? > 0\u00ba? \n\na) b) \n\nEquation 4.

The annual freezing-thawing \n\nperiods considered for the computation of these indexes is the same as the one used for the \n\ndetermination of the thawing and freezing air degree days.

Then, the n-factors are \n\ncalculated as the ratio of the ground surface freezing or thawing indexes to the freezing or \n\nthawing air temperature indexes for the same season (Lunardini, 1978 in Burn, 1998), as per \n\nthe Equations 7a and 7b. \n\n \n\nIta = Cumulative air thawing degree days (\u00baCdia) \n\nIfa = Cumulative air freezing degree days (\u00baCdia) \n\nIts = Cumulative surface thawing degree days (\u00baCdia) \n\nIfs = Cumulative air surface degree days (\u00baCdia) \n\nnt = Scaling factor between air and surface thawing index  \n\nnf = Scaling factor between air and surface freezing index \n\n \n\nDue to the scarce of experimental ground surface temperatures mentioned before in section \n\n3.2, n-factors in this work were computed as the ratio of the ground freezing or thawing \n\nindexes at 5cm depth to the freezing or thawing air temperature indexes (Equation 8). \n\nTherefore, by considering Ts ?

For sites 4 and 5 (characterized by a \n\nunconsolidated substrate), the n-factors account for the top 5 cm soil layer plus the potential \n\nsnow cover thermal buffer effect through the year. Finally, in site 8 (characterized by 40 cm \n\nof moss cover over a peat substrate), the n-factors account for the top 5 cm moss layer plus \n\nthe potential snow cover thermal buffer effect through the year.   \n\n \n\n3.3.2.4 Kt/Kf \n\n \n\nKt/Kf stands for the ratio between the thermal conductivity of a thawed soil and the thermal \n\nconductivity of the same soil when frozen. \n\nConsidering that the soils are composed by multiple phase materials with different physical \n\nproperties such as solid particles, gas and/or liquid, the thermal properties of the soils are \n\naffected by the variation of each phase too. As mentioned in Dong et al. (2015), the thermal \n\nconductivity k varies depending on the soil phase. As an example, values of k of different \n\nmaterials are given: thermal conductivity of mineral particles kmineral = 3 W/m K, thermal \n\nconductivity of dry soil kdry_soil=0.5 W/m K , thermal conductivity of water kwater = 0.56 \n\nW/m K (at 0 \u00baC), and thermal conductivity of air kair = 0.026 W/m K) (Mitchell &amp; Soga 2005; \n\nYun &amp; Santamarina 2008).  \n\nIn dry soils, which account with a lower packing density of particles and more porosity, the \n\nair obstructs the heat conduction occurring through the particle contacts. This fact, together \n\nwith the mineral composition, explains the significant difference between k values of pure \n\nmineral soils and dry soils (Farouki, 1981). At the other end, in water saturated soils, the \n\nreplacement of air with water provides a significant improvement in the heat conduction \n\nthrough the soil mixture. Consequently, the magnitude of the thermal conductivity of water-\n\nsaturated soil is between that of the pure mineral and that of water. The ordered sequence of \n\ntypical thermal conductivity values is: kair<kdry_soil<kwater<ksaturated_soil<kmineral.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n55 \n\n \n\nTherefore, the thermal properties of soils, considering isothermal conditions, mainly depend \n\non different factors as: mineralogy, particle size, particle shape, porosity and moisture content \n\n(Dong et al., 2015). These factors can be sum up in two main groups: soil type and ground \n\nwater content. \n\n \n\n- Soil type: Mineralogy, porosity particle size and shape are the characteristics defining \n\nde different types of soil. Pure mineral soils are the ones characterized by the highest \n\nthermal conductivity in the air\u2013water\u2013solid soil system. \n\nConsidering that a larger particle\u2019s diameter promotes a higher rate of heat flux \n\nbetween particles, larger particles with less contacts in a given volume result in higher \n\nthermal conductivity (Aduda, 1996).  \n\n- Water content: Moisture content in the soil is a dominant factor to the thermal \n\nconductivity. The higher the water content in the soil, the higher heat transfer rate \n\nthrough the substrate, especially in unconsolidated and high porosity soils.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3.2.5 Thermal Offset \n\n \n\nThe thermal offset is defined as the difference between the TTOP and at the MAGST  (Wu &amp; \n\nShi, 2003) (see Equation 9). This equation comes from the relation previously represented in \n\nEquation 3. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn Equation 9, TTOP stands for the temperature at the top of permafrost and MAGST for the \n\nmean annual ground surface temperature, which in this work, is considered 5 cm below the \n\nsurface.  \n\n \n\nThe thermal offset arises because the thermal conductivity of a soil is higher when frozen than \n\nwhen thawed. This effect can be explained by the seasonal variations in soil moisture near the \n\nground surface, with drier surface conditions in the thawing period and wetter conditions in \n\nthe freezing period increasing the effect (Smith &amp; Riseborough, 1996). \n\n??????? =  ???? ? ????? \n\nEquation 9. Thermal offset as a function of TTOP and MAGST (Burn &amp; Smith, 1988) \n\n\n\n  \n\n56 \n\n \n\nA theoretical expression to link thermal offsets with the thermal regime and characteristics of \n\nthe active layer near-surface permafrost (Equation 10) was put forward by Romanovsky &amp; \n\nOsterkamp (1995): \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn Equation 10, kf and kt are the thermal conductivities of the active layer in frozen and \n\nthawed states, Its is the annual total thawing degree-days at the ground surface and P is the \n\nperiod of the thawing and freezing cycle.  \n\nAs ground thermal fluxes were not measured in this investigation, the values of Kt and Kf \n\ncould not be compute for our locals and its uncertainty cannot be discussed. However, the \n\nthermal offset values for each monitoring site was determined with the application of \n\nEquation 9 when analysing the ground temperature to depth \u201ctrumpet profile\u201d graphs. \n\nTherefore, Equation 2 was the general expression chosen for the computation of the TTOP \n\nmodel in this work.  \n\n \n\n3.3.2.6 TTOP local implementation and validation \n\nOnce the TTOP model parameters were determined for the 9 monitoring sites, we used the \n\nresults to implement the general TTOP model formula (Equation 2) in these locations to \n\ndetermine the Temperature at the Top of Permafrost. Then, we evaluated the adjustment of \n\nthe results given by the TTOP model formula to the TTOP values previously estimated or \n\nobserved in each location using the analysis of the trumpet profile.  \n\n \n\nTo validate the TTOP model at a local scale, we plotted the TTOP formula results with the \n\nvalues observed or estimated values by graphical analysis of the trumpet profile. The better \n\nthe adjustment of the scatter dots to the y=x line, the better is considered the estimation of the \n\nTTOP model. \n\nAfter evaluating this adjustment, the TTOP model was found to be a good estimator for the \n\ntemperature at the top of permafrost, suitable to be spatially extrapolated for the whole area \n\nextent.  \n\n??????? =  \n???\n\n?\n(\n\n??\n\n??\n? 1) \n\nEquation 10.

Each parameter of the model was spatialized following its statistical relations with \n\ndifferent terrain features. \n\nIn order to identify the spatial controls on the TTOP parameters, literature was reviewed to \n\nidentify which features were expected to show a higher influence in each TTOP parameter \n\nusing the literature.  \n\nSecondly, the spatial distribution of these terrain features was modelled using the software \n\nArcMap10.4.  \n\nLater on, the correlations between each terrain feature and the TTOP parameters, were \n\ncalculated, in order to identify their statistical significance in our particular area of interest. \n\nFinally, statistical relations were established between TTOP parameters and its most \n\ninfluencing terrain features. The workflow for this process is explained below. \n\n \n\n3.3.3.1 Potential influence of terrain features in the TTOP parameters \n\n \n\nA) Air thawing and freezing indexes \n\nThe air thawing and freezing indexes (It, If) are directly related with the air temperature. \n\nHowever, the atmosphere is not isothermal but air temperature generally falls quite noticeably \n\nwith increasing altitude following the adiabatic lapse rate of the atmosphere, defined as \u201cthe \n\nchange of temperature with a change in altitude of an air parcel that decreases in pressure and \n\ntemperature and increases in volume without gaining or losing any heat to the environment \n\nsurrounding the parcel\u201d (Muralikrishna &amp; Manickam, 2017). \n\nAs a function of air temperature, the air thawing and freezing indexes are also expected to be \n\nlinearly related with height.  \n\n \n\nB) N-factors \n\nIn section 3.3.2.3, we introduced that n-factors mainly account for the local influence of moss \n\ncover, snow cover and the 5 cm surface layer thermal offset, which variates depending on \n\nsurface characteristics (soil type and moss bed).  \n\nThe primary influence of moss cover in n-factors is due to the great insulation effect, as the \n\nmoss both shades and insulates the ground resulting in a reduction of solar radiation reaching \n\n\n\n  \n\n58 \n\n \n\nthe ground surface and summer heat flux (Guglielmin et al., 2012). In addition, the \n\ninterception of precipitation and the transpiration by the moss influences the ground thermal \n\nregime through the water balance (Smith &amp; Risebourgh, 1996). Consequently, sites covered \n\nby moss are expected to be characterized by lower values of n-factor, representing a greater \n\nground insulating buffer layer, while bare ground sites show higher n-factors with values \n\ncloser to the unity (air temperature equals the ground surface temperatures). \n\nOn the other hand, considering that our study area consists only of the snow-free areas in the \n\nend of summer, a buffer layer of snow will form over most places, mainly during the winter. \n\nSnow cover of any depth acts as a physical barrier, preventing solar radiation and wind \n\nvariations from influencing temperature fluctuations on the ground surface (Humlum, 1997). \n\nIn addition, the low thermal conductivity of snow restricts the loss of heat from the ground \n\nduring the coldest part of the year. As a result, local spatial variability in snow cover is the \n\nlargest single factor accounting for variations in the ground surface temperature mainly during \n\nthe winter months (Desrochers &amp; Granberg, 1988), but also in spring and autumn, although at \n\na lower rate as these seasons are generally characterized by thinner snow cover (Guglielmin et \n\nal., 2012). Therefore, snow cover has a strong influence mostly in the freezing n-factor values. \n\nThis relationship between snow cover and nf is expected to be negative, thus the thicker the \n\nsnow cover, the higher the insulation and the lowest the freezing n-factor (Lanouette et al., \n\n2015). \n\n \n\nThe spatial distribution of snow cover usually depends on topographic features and \n\ncharacteristics of the ground. Elevation, aspect and curvature are topographic features that \n\nhave been found to be statistically significant in the variability of winter snow accumulation \n\nand spring melt according to results obtained by Erickson &amp; Williams (2005) and Jost et al. \n\n(2007). These studies showed that elevation had a strong positive relationship mainly in the \n\nperiods of peak snow accumulation and during snow-melt. Regarding to aspect, south-facing \n\nslopes would have the highest correlation with snow accumulation in the southern \n\nhemisphere.  \n\nThe curvature affects the acceleration, deceleration, convergence and divergence of flow \n\nacross the surface and, therefore, influences snow deposition. Concave curvatures are \n\nexpected to have a higher potential accumulation of snow than convex sites.  \n\nThe last factor influencing in the n-factors would be the thermal offset present in the 5 cm top \n\nsurface layer, this mainly depending on the thermal characteristics of the top 5 cm soil layer, \n\n\n\n  \n\n59 \n\n \n\nbeing the substrate type and water content the main factors with potential influence on its \n\nthermal characteristics. \n\n \n\nTherefore, elevation, aspect, curvature, moss cover, substrate type and water content might be \n\nsomehow correlated with n-factors and were assumed as possible candidates explaining a \n\nlarge proportion of the spatial variability of n-factors.  \n\n \n\nB) Thermal Offset \n\nIn section 3.3.2.5, we introduced that the active layer thermal offset, as a function of the \n\nthawed and frozen thermal conductivity ratio kt/kf, accounts for the thermal properties of the \n\nsubstrate, which mainly depend on the type and water content of the substrate at different \n\ndepths and locations (Wu &amp; Shi, 2003). Equation 9 defines the thermal offset of the \n\nseasonally thawing layer as the difference of the temperature in the TOP and the ground \n\nsurface. \n\n \n\nFigure 28 suggests that the substrates with higher conductivity show steepest temperature \n\ngradients than the ones with lower conductivities (Williams &amp; Smith, 1989). The steeper the \n\nthermal gradient (and thus the higher conductivity), the lower the result of the absolute value \n\nof the thermal offset (TTOP-MAGST) and vice-versa.  \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n60 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nConsidering the aforementioned relation in section 3.3.2.4 (kair &lt;kdry_soil &lt;kwater &lt;\n\nksaturated_soil &lt;kmineral), the mineral soils and bedrock (with low porosity) have the \n\nhighest thermal conductivity when they are dry, however, for peat and uncosolidated \n\nsubstrates (with higher porosity), a higher soil moisture content increases the soil\u2019s \n\nconductivity (Wu &amp; Shi, 2003). Therefore, the water content of the substrate is expected to \n\nhave a large influence in the thermal offset. However, the statistical relationships between \n\nthermal offset and water content must be determined separately for bedrock areas in one side \n\nand for peats and unconsolidated materials on the other. \n\n \n\n3.3.3.2 Spatial distribution of TTOP controlling factors \n\nElevation, aspect, curvature, moss cover, substrate type and water content have been \n\nconsidered to have potential influence in TTOP parameters and are assumed to explain a large \n\nproportion of the spatial variability these parameters. The spatial distribution of these terrain \n\nfeatures over the area of interest was implemented with a resolution of 1 m using the GIS \n\nbased software ArcMap10.4 as follows: \n\n \n\nFigure 28. Influence of thermal conductivity on the ground thermal offset (modified from \n\nWilliams &amp; Smith, 1989). \n\nTTOP MAGST \nToffset \n\nTemperature \n\n\n\n  \n\n61 \n\n \n\n\u2022 Moss cover: The areas covered by moss were determined by analysis of the high-\n\nresolution orthomosaic presented in Section 3.1.3. Feature polygons were \n\nmanually created over the most noticeable moss patches using the software \n\nArcMap 10.4. This feature layer was later converted to raster format (Figure 29).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Snow cover: The seasonal snow cover cannot be determined by simple \n\nobservation of the mosaic, as it represents an end of summer scenario and the \n\ndistribution and thickness of the snow vary spatially and temporarily. As \n\nmentioned in section 3.3.3.1B, the surface snow accumulation depends on different \n\nlandforms and terrain features, as elevation, aspect, terrain curvature or solar \n\nradiation. \n\nThese parameters were derived from the 1 m resolution\u2019s digital surface model \n\n(DSM) described in Section 3.1.3 using the ArcGIS\u2019s Spatial Analyst tools: \n\nFigure 29.

Therefore, the \n\nmain influencing factors in the thermal offset are expected to be the same ones \n\ninfluencing the soil\u2019s thermal conductivity, such as the substrate type and water \n\ncontent (see Section 3.3.2.5). \n\nThese two factors were determined as follows:  \n\n- Substrate type: A soil type map was implemented through aerial photo \n\ninterpretation in ArcMap 10.4 based on the high resolution ortophotomap. The \n\nsubstrate was classified in bedrock, unconsolidated soil and peat. Feature \n\npolygons were shaped over the different soil type\u2019s areas to be later converted \n\nto raster format (Figure 33). \n\n- Topographic wetness index (TWI): The TWI is a steady-state wetness index \n\nthat describes a form of potential wetness due to topographic and not \n\nsubsurface conditions. The index is widely employed as a soil moisture \n\nsubstitute, and several studies exist relating it to measured soil moisture (e.g. \n\nEtzelm\u00fcller, 2006; Sulebak et al., 2000; Hugget and Cheesman, 2002). \n\nTWI index involves the upslope contributing area (a), a slope raster (B), in the \n\nfollowing relation (Cooley, 2016a):  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe value of a for each cell in the output raster is the value of the flow \n\naccumulation for the corresponding DEM raster. It was extracted from the \n\nfilled DSM following the method explained in Cooley (2016b).  \n\nHigher TWI values represent drainage lines, with low gradient areas showing \n\ngreater potential to gather water and increase potential soil water saturation. \n\nLower values represent crests and ridges with steep and convex characteristics, \n\ntending to disperse water and showing lower potential soil moisture. The \n\ncomputed TWI spatial distribution is shown in Figure 34. \n\nTWI = ln(a/tan B) \n\nEquation 11.

This allows determining the statistical significance of \n\nthe control of each terrain feature for the TTOP parameters. \n\nTo determine the correlations of these features, we computed non-parametric (Spearman) \n\ncorrelations and regression parameters using the statistical package IBM SPSS Statistics 25. \n\nSpearman rank correlation is a non-parametric test that is used to measure the degree of \n\nrelation between two variables. It assesses how well the relationship between two variables \n\ncan be described using a monotonic function. The Spearman rank correlation test does not \n\ncarry any assumption about the distribution of the data and is the appropriate correlation \n\nanalysis when the variables are measured on a scale that is at least ordinal (Statistical \n\nSolutions, 2018). \n\nThe following formula was used to calculate the Spearman rank correlation: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWhere:  \n\n?= Spearman rank correlation \n\ndi= the difference between the ranks of corresponding variables \n\nn= number of observations \n\n \n\nA perfect Spearman correlation of +1 or ?1 occurs when each of the variables is a perfect \n\nmonotone function of the other. A positive correlation coefficient indicates a direct \n\nrelationship between the two variables (as one variable increases, the other variable also \n\nincreases), while a negative correlation coefficient expresses an inverse relationship (as one \n\nvariable increases, the other variable decreases).  A correlation coefficient of 0 indicates that no \n\nrelationship exists between the variables and a coefficient of 1 indicates a perfect relationship \n\n(Statistical Solutions, 2018).  \n\n? = 1 ?\n6 ? ?2?\n\n?(?2 ? 1)\n \n\nEquation 12. Spearman Rank correlation \n\nformula (Statistical Solutions, 2018) \n\n\n\n  \n\n67 \n\n \n\nIn order to determine the strength of the relationship, the conventions proposed by Cohen \n\n(1988) may be considered. He proposed that correlation coefficients between .10 and .29 \n\nrepresent a weak association, coefficients between .30 and .49 represent a medium \n\nassociation, and coefficients of .50 and above represent a large association or relationship. \n\n \n\n3.3.3.4 Relationship functions and parameter spatialization \n\nIn order to identify the relationships between the TTOP parameters (dependent variables) and \n\nits most influencing factors (independent variables or predictors), we computed multivariate \n\nlinear regressions using the SPSS software tool. \n\nFollowing the Peter\u2019s rule of thumb, in order to estimate a dependant variable using \n\nmultivariate linear regressions, ideally a minimum sample size of 10 sample points is needed \n\nper each independent variable used as a predictor (Peduzzi et al., 1996). The available sample \n\nsize in this investigation is just 9 sample points, however this sample size was considered \n\nclose enough to the minimum to apply this estimation method using only one estimator per \n\neach dependent variable. It is important to take in consideration that the scarce number of \n\nsample points might create a higher probability of relation due to randomness in the results. \n\nFor the estimation of functions using multivariable regression, it is first necessary to check \n\nsome assumptions regarding to the input data. These assumptions are described below as per \n\nStatistical Solutions (2018b): \n\n\u2022 Linearity: The outcome variable and the independent variables must follow a linear \n\nrelationship.  Scatterplots are a good tool to evaluate if there is a linear or curvilinear \n\nrelationship. \n\n\u2022 Multivariate Normality: Multiple regression consider that the residuals (differences \n\nbetween the observed value of the dependent variable and the predicted value) present \n\na normal distribution. The normality of residuals can be evaluated with a normal \n\nPredicted Probability (P-P) plot. If they are, they will adjust to the diagonal normality \n\nline indicated in the plot.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n68 \n\n \n\n\u2022 Homoscedasticity: Multiple regression assumes that the variance of residuals is similar \n\nacross the values of the independent variables.  When exanimating a plot of \n\nstandardized residuals versus predicted values, we can evaluate weather points are \n\nequally distributed across all values of the independent variables. There should be no \n\ndefined pattern in the distribution, the data should look like randomly speared over the \n\nplot; if there is a cone-shaped pattern, the data is heteroscedastic. \n\n\u2022 No Multicollinearity: The independent variables must not be highly correlated with \n\neach other.  This assumption can be tested using the Spearman correlation matrix \n\n(correlations among all predictor variables should be less than .80) or the Variance \n\nInflation Factor (VIF) values should be lower than 10. \n\nHowever, as we just used one independent variable as a predictor for each model \n\nparameter (following the Peter\u2019s rule of thumb), it was not necessary to check this \n\nassumption conscientiously.  \n\n \n\nFollowing these considerations, each TTOP parameter was expressed as a function of the \n\nterrain feature with the highest Spearman correlation, besides a logic physical relationship as \n\nexplained in section 3.3.3.1. Thus, It and If were expressed as a function of the elevation, Nt \n\nand Nf were to be expressed as a function of the moss cover and curvature respectively and, \n\ntoffset as a function of TWI depending on the different soil types.  \n\n \n\nThe rules compliance of the assumptions mentioned above was tested for each parameter of \n\nthe linear regression. Exceptionally, a different method was used for the computation of the \n\nrelationship between nt and moss cover. Simple linear regression cannot be applied to this \n\nparameter due to the availability of a single borehole with the moss cover attribute. This fact \n\nlimited the statistical analysis of these data to correlations and created a high probability of \n\nrelation due to randomness. However, the moss cover was shown to have a noticeable \n\ninfluence in the nt parameter in the correlation matrix and a difference of 1.01 in the nt values \n\nwas observed between analogue monitoring sites 7-MossRock (nt=2.00) and 8-MossMoss \n\n(nt=0.99) only differenced by the presence of absence of moss cover. Thus, a different \n\nrelation between nt factor and moss cover was applied for the spatialization of the parameter.  \n\nThe mean of nf values obtained in the moss-free monitoring sites (nt=2.08) was given to the \n\nmoss-free areas, whereas this mean value minus 1.01, was given to all the areas covered by \n\nmosses.  \n\n\n\n  \n\n69 \n\n \n\n3.3.4 SPATIAL MODEL IMPLEMENTATION \n\nOnce the relationship functions were established for each TTOP parameter, these expressions \n\nwere computed in ArcMap 10.4 over the study area. The spatial distribution of the different \n\nparameters of the model resulted in five 1 m resolution rasters. Then, the TTOP model \n\nexpression (Equation 2) was computed introducing as inputs the previously spatialized \n\nparameters. The resulting map for the spatial distribution of the TTOP model all over the \n\nstudy area had a resolution of 1 m as well and are presented in the results section 4. \n\n \n\n \n3.4 Spatial model validation \n\nOnce a spatial model was created for each parameter, we checked how close the results of the \n\nparameters\u2019 spatial estimation were to the parameters determined locally for each monitoring \n\nsite using observed data. Then, we validated the final TTOP spatial model by comparing the \n\nresults to the observed data about the Temperature in the Top Of Permafrost previously \n\ndetermined in section 3.2.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3.5 TTOP spatial model considering a 1 \u00baC air temperature increase \n\nscenario \n\nOnce the TTOP spatial model was created, the resulting model was used to identify and \n\nevaluate the potential sensitivity of permafrost and the seasonal thawing layer in case of a \n\nhypothetical scenario, showing a 1 \u00baC increase in the long term mean annual temperatures. \n\nFor this purpose, we computed the air thawing and freezing indexes with a 1 \u00baC increment \n\nover the recorded air temperatures during years 1 and 2. As a generalization, n-factors and \n\nthermal offset values were considered to remain constant in this hypothetical scenario, \n\ndisregarding changes in any other topo-climatic factor such as seasonal snow pack, moss \n\ndistribution or soil moisture content.  \n\nThe TTOP spatial model was ran using the new input values of Ita and Ifa, considering the \n\nmean daily temperature increase of 1 \u00baC in a long-term scenario.  \n\nWhen the air temperatures increase considering these assumptions, the ground temperatures \n\nare expected to also increase, at higher or smaller rates, until the thermal regime reaches a \n\nstationary state. When this happens, the three curves (MinAGT, MAGT and MaxAGT) in the \n\n\n\n  \n\n70 \n\n \n\nground thermal \u201ctrumpet profile\u201d (Figure 2) will slightly shift over the x-axis to warmer \n\ntemperatures maintaining the original profile (once reached the stationary state). \n\nWhen the new TTOP point reaches 0 \u00baC in the MAGT curve as a consequence of a general \n\nground warming, it means that below the depth at that point, the mean annual ground \n\ntemperature will keep positive values until reaching the ZAA point. Therefore, positive TTOP \n\nvalues below that depth, whichever it is, correspond to the mean annual temperature at the top \n\nof the seasonal freezing and thawing layer, where permafrost is not present anymore.  \n\n \n\nConsidering these properties of the ground\u2019s thermal regime, the spatial distribution of the \n\nTemperature of the Top of Permafrost after the hypothetical MAAT increment was computed \n\nover the study area. This allowed for the determination of the most sensitive permafrost areas \n\nto warming. \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n71 \n\n \n\n4. Results and discussion \n\n4.1 Characteristics of the local ground temperature regimes  \n\nSite 1 borehole provided the most complete ground and air temperature graph, with \n\ncontinuous records from 2012 to 2018 (Figures 20 and 35) and shows the best data to evaluate \n\nhow the ground temperature regime evolved during this period in Cierva Point and its \n\nrelations with air temperature fluctuations. Permafrost was found in this borehole within the \n\nthermistors\u2019 depth extent with the top of permafrost occurring at approximately 5 m depth.  \n\nFigure 37 shows the difference on the inter annual fluctuations of the temperatures at 3 \n\ndifferent levels: air (at 150 cm above the surface), the surface (at 5cm depth) and the mean \n\ndepth of the top of permafrost (5 m). This graph is a useful tool for the interpretation of the \n\nclimate characteristics of this site and its linkages with ground temperature fluctuations over \n\nthe period from 2012 to 2018 (even though a gap exists in the air temperature records from \n\n2014 to 2016). The analysis of this graph gives some insights about the thermal impact of the \n\nsnowpack on the ground surface temperature. Through its buffer effect as an insulator layer, \n\nthe snowpack influences the thermal offset existing between air and surface temperature. The \n\nthermal offset between air and surface (?T) is defined as the difference between the ground \n\nsurface temperature (GST) and air temperature (Tair). \n\n \n\n?T (\u00b0C)= GST-Tair \n\n \n\nWinter and summer air temperatures over the period did not show significant differences, \n\ndespite an outlier minimum peak of -20\u00b0C in the winter of 2013. The maximum air \n\ntemperature reached over the period was 4.25\u00b0C in the last summer season (2017). \n\nHowever, some differences were found in the thermal offset (?T) values during the periods \n\nfrom 2012-2014 and 2016-2018. In the first period, the winter ground surface thermal regime \n\nshows a stronger decoupling from the cold air temperatures than in the period of 2016-2018, \n\nresulting in a strong positive surface thermal offset and a warmer value of the MAGST. In \n\ncontrast, the surface thermal regime at the second period is strongly coupled with the \n\natmospheric conditions involving a lower surface thermal offset and lower values of MAGST, \n\nindicating that the snowpack provided a weak insulation to the surface. These observations \n\nmay reflect a longer lasting and thicker snowpack accumulation during the winter seasons of \n\n2012 and 2013, which would have provided a higher insulation to the surface for longer than \n\n\n\n  \n\n72 \n\n \n\nthe thinner snowpack in 2016-2018. A reduction of the active layer thickness during the first \n\ntwo years of the dataset in Figure 36a may also be explained by this fact. \n\nThis phenomenon was observed as well in nearby Western Antarctic regions such as \n\nDeception Island (WAP). Here, between 2006 and 2014, a reduction of the active layer \n\nthickness at a rate of about 1.5\u2013 2cm a?1 linked with episodes of longer lasting and thicker \n\nsnow accumulation over the surface, was reported (Goyanes et al., 2014; Ramos et al., 2017). \n\n \n\n \n\nHowever, not only the snow cover thickness can influence the MAGST fluctuations but also \n\nthe snow properties, the near-surface material properties, and especially the snowpack timing \n\nand duration (Ling &amp; Zhang, 2003). \n\nThe timing of the snowpack disappearance in spring coincides with the time when the GST \n\nrises above 0 \u00baC, normally after a brief zero curtain effect period. This effect maintains the \n\nGST close to 0 \u00baC due to the influence of the latent heat consumption in spring during \n\nsnowmelt (Davense et al., 2017). During the spring of 2015 and 2017, the zero curtain effect \n\nwas observed to be very short (only a few days starting at the end of November and ending in \n\nearly December), in comparison with the previous years (when the zero curtain effect lasted \n\nfor more than a month from the end of November to early January), which suggests the \n\nthinner snowpack accumulation during these years. \n\nThe early and brief snowmelt in spring is favourable to quick surface warming and higher \n\ntemperatures at the top of permafrost after the warm season because of the direct exposure of \n\nFigure 35. Air, ground surface and top of permafrost temperatures over the period from 2012 to 2018. Records of \n\nair temperature from 2014 to 2016 were not available. \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n73 \n\n \n\nthe ground to solar radiation, positive air temperature, and the low amount of heat required to \n\nmelt the thin snowpack (Ling &amp; Zhang, 2003). \n\nNevertheless, significant variations on the top of permafrost thermal wave have not been \n\nfound. Only a slightly decrement of the TTOP below 0 \u00baC during the warm season was \n\nspotted after the winters showing longer zero curtain effects and therefore, a possible thicker \n\nsnowpack accumulation. \n\n \n\nFigure 36b shows the inter-annual oscillations observed in the depth of the top of permafrost. \n\nThe active layer thickness slightly decreased along the first two years of monitoring (2012-\n\n2014), from almost 6 m the first year and reaching its minimum depth in 2014 (ci. 4 m). \n\nDuring the following years, from 2015 to the beginning of 2018, the top of permafrost ranged \n\nbetween 4.5 and 5 m. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 36. a) Observed ground temperature profile in Site 1 (Permafrost) between 2012 and 2018.

Consequently, for the \n\nimplementation of the \u201ctrumpet profile\u201d graphs (Figures 37b-44b) in each borehole, only the \n\naverage temperatures of years 1 and 2, from March 2012 to March 2014 (with complete \n\nrecords for a thawing/freezing cycle), were used to estimate the MaxAGT, MAGT and \n\nMinAGT. The best-fit functions, approximated by least squares regression to the MaxAGT, \n\nMAGT and MinAGT are presented in Table 4. \n\n \n\n \n\nIn the \u201ctrumpet profiles\u201d for Sites 5-Moraine and site 8-MossMoss (Figures 40b and 43b), the \n\nMaxAGT was observed to stay invariable close to 0 \u00baC below 1 m and 0.4 m, respectively. \n\nThis reflects the high moisture content at these depths, as no temperature change occurs from \n\nheat transfer during the phase change from ice to liquid water due to its latent heat of fusion, \n\nso that during the summer the temperature remains constant at 0 \u00baC.  \n\nConsidering that the thermistors provide measurements with an uncertainty of 0.5 \u00baC, and the \n\nice-water mixture stability, 0 \u00baC was considered to be the actual temperature existing in the \n\nground during the warm season and matching with continuous ice-thawing below 1 m depth \n\nin Site5 and 0.4 m in Site8. Therefore, the mean difference between the measured MaxAGT \n\nand 0 \u00baC during the phase change for each borehole (0.15 \u00baC and 0.3 \u00baC respectively) were \n\nsubtracted from the observed ground temperature for 0 \u00baC calibration. \n\nThe thermal trumpet profile, after rectification, is shown in figures 40c and 43c. These figures \n\nshow that below 1 m and 0.4 m respectively in boreholes 5 and 8, the ground never thaws \n\ncompletely and therefore these depths were considered the upper limit of the permafrost table. \n\nPermafrost was not clearly observed in the rest of the boreholes, which are not deep enough to \n\nreach the permafrost table, or even because permafrost may be absent.  \n\n \n\nMinGAT MGAT MaxGAT MinGAT MGAT MaxGAT\n\nS1-Permafrost - - - - - -\n\nS2-Summit d(cm)= -8.2672(T)2 - 162.21(T) - 801.42 d(cm)= 499.94(T) + 846.16 d(cm) = 0.1032(T)3 - 3.2833(T)2 + 46.038(T) - 277.33 0.997 0.542 0.997\n\nS3-Belowsummit d(cm) = -23.951(T)2 - 362.75(T) - 1378 d(cm) = 574.3(T) + 1171 y = 0.5227(T)3 - 9.4711(T)2 + 68.871(T) - 221.84 0.999 0.594 0.999\n\nS4-Saddle d(cm) = -19.568(T)2 - 243.48(T) - 766.37 0&lt;d(cm)&lt;-400; T=-1.61 d(cm) = 0.5857x3 - 10.198x2 + 68.249(T) - 188.4 0.982 0.101 0.999\n\nS5-Moraine - - - - - -\n\nS6-Midslope d(cm)= -3.9422(T)3 - 65.48(T)2 - 375.44(T) - 763.55 0&lt;d(cm)&lt;-550; T=-0.69 d(cm)= 0.5005x3 - 12.776x2 + 120.7x - 424.38 0.987 - 0.998\n\nS7-MossRock d(cm)= 4195.2(T)3 + 6377.5(T)2 + 3291.7(T) + 540.39 d(cm)= -5.0334(T)2 - 92.149(T) - 431.31 d(cm)= 0.3437(T)3 - 8.8005(T)2 + 81.588(T) - 295.45 0.941 0.989 0.999\n\nS8-MossMoss - - - - - -\n\nS9-LowDeep d(cm) = -0.6747(T)3 - 18.984(T)2 - 192.25(T)- 744.21 d(cm) = -937.03(T)2 - 1669.4(T) - 773.29 d(cm) = 0.7322(T)3 - 19.474(T)2 + 195.54(T) - 814.14 0.996 0.69 0.997\n\nCurve function R2\n\nTable 4.

Here, the lower value of Nt for \n\nSite 8 (0.99) against the value in the analogue Site 7 (2.00) is explained by the presence of a \n\nthick moss cover in the first site, which acts as a thermal insulator layer.  \n\nThe linkages between the potential snow cover and the top layer thermal offset with the \n\nmagnitude of n-factors in the rest of the boreholes are further discussed in Section 4.3, after \n\nthe analysis of the curvature and thermal offset characterizing these sites. \n\n \n\n4.2.1.4 Toffset \n\nThe local results of the active layer thermal offset for the 9 monitoring Sites in Cierva Point \n\nare shown in Table 9.

The linkages between the resulting thermal offset \n\nvalues with the substrate characteristics and moisture content are further discussed in Section \n\n4.3, after the analysis of the substrate type and topographic wetness indexes characterizing \n\nthese sites. \n\n \n\n4.2.2 LOCAL RESULTS OF TTOP AND MODEL VALIDATION \n\nTable 10 summarizes the results for all the TTOP model parameters (Is, Ia, n-factors, toffset) \n\npreviously computed using the observed data together with the local results for the depth at \n\nthe TOP and the TTOP values estimated or observed using the analysis of the trumpet profile. \n\nAt the bottom of the Table 10, the TTOP results given by the TTOP model equation \n\n(Equation 2) are presented.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe deepest permafrost table was found to be in Site 1 (Permafrost), where the permafrost \n\ntable was observed at 5 m depth with a temperature of -1.21\u00b0C. However, a value 0.07\u00b0C \n\nhigher was obtained computing the TTOP formula (equation 2). In Sites 5 (Moraine) and 8 \n\n(MossMoss), the temperature at the top of permafrost was found to be -2.59\u00b0C and -1.35\u00b0C, at \n\n1 m and 0.4 m respectively, coinciding with the depth of isothermal maximum annual surface \n\ntemperature at 0\u00b0C. A slight difference of -0.25\u00b0C was found between the observed data in \n\nTable 10. Results for all the TTOP model parameters (Is, Ia, n-factors, toffset), the depth at the Top of \n\nPermafrost (TOP) and the Temperature at the Top Of Permafrost (TTOP) values estimated or observed using the \n\nanalysis of the trumpet profile and TTOP results given by the TTOP model equation. All values are given \n\ntogether with the propagated measurement uncertainty. \n\nS1-Permafrost S2-Summit S3-Belowsummit S4-Saddle S5-Moraine S6-Midslope S7-MossRock S8-MossMoss S9-LowDeep\n\nIfs (5cm) (\u00b0C day) 714.7 1162.1 1008.7 801.4 1090.4 631.0 729.2 747.9 850.5\n\nIts (5cm) (\u00b0C day) 169.0 485.8 229.6 203.0 324.0 292.2 610.7 301.8 548.6\n\nIfa (\u00b0C day) 1333.4 1422.1 1369.6 1368.5 1198.9 1049.6 988.2 988.2 1002.8\n\nIta (\u00b0C day) 118.4 112.5 121.5 133.8 147.8 334.9 304.7 304.7 230.6\n\nNf 0.54 0.82 0.74 0.59 0.91 0.60 0.74 0.76 0.85\n\nNt 1.43 4.32 1.89 1.52 2.19 0.87 2.00 0.99 2.38\n\nObserved/estimated \n\nTOP (m)\n-5.00 -2.78 -2.20 -1.90 -1.00 -4.26 -2.95 -0.40\n\nNo permafros t \n\npres ence \n\nes ti mated\n\nObserved/estimated \n\nToffset (\u00b0C)\n0.38 -0.35 -0.24 0.06 -0.70 0.23 0.15 -0.10 1.10\n\nObserved/estimated  \n\nTTOP (\u00b0C)\n-1.21 -2.25 -2.42 -1.61 -2.59 -0.69 -0.18 -1.35 0.32\n\nTTOP formula (\u00b0C) -1.14 -2.24 -2.42 -1.61 -2.84 -0.72 -0.18 -1.35 0.26\n\n\n\n  \n\n83 \n\n \n\nSite 5 and the value obtained through the TTOP equation (which is the maximum difference \n\nfound in all the boreholes), while no difference occurs in Site 8. \n\n \n\nFor the other monitored sites, TOP and TTOP were estimated by graphical analysis of the \n\ntemperature regression functions in their trumpet profiles. The permafrost table was estimated \n\nto exist at depths ranging from 4.26 m (in Site 6) and 1.9 m (in Site 4) below the ground \n\nsurface and the TTOP values determined range from -2.42\u00b0C (in Site 3) and -0.18\u00b0C (in Site \n\n7). In Site 9, no permafrost is estimated to occur. Therefore, the value of 0.26\u00b0C in this \n\nlocation corresponds to the ground temperature at the base of the seasonal freezing and \n\nthawing layer. \n\nFigure 45 shows the degree of adjustment of the TTOP formula (Equation 2) results with the \n\nobserved or estimated values by graphical analysis. The adjustment is better when \n\nobserved/estimated values equal the values resulting from the TTOP model equation. \n\nTherefore, the adjustment is considered to be better when the distribution of dots and triangles \n\nis closer to the y=x line (grey dotted line in the Figure 45). The plot results show a value of \n\nadjustment of the data of R2=0.98 to the y=x line and a mean error of 0.05 \u00baC between \n\nmodelled and observed data, being the site 1 (Permafrost) the one presenting the highest \n\ndeviation. With these values, the TTOP model was considered as a good estimator for the \n\ntemperature at the top of permafrost, suitable to be spatially extrapolated for the whole area \n\nextent.  \n\nFigure 45.

Values coloured in red highlight the correlation indexes \n\nwhich absolute value is high enough (?>0.5) to consider the influence of that terrain feature \n\nstatistically significant in the respective TTOP parameter. This threshold was considered \n\nfollowing the standards presented by Cohen (1988) and aforementioned in section 3.3.3.3. \n\nMoreover, just the statistically significant results with a logic physical relationship are \n\nconsidered later for the spatial modelling of each parameter.  \n\n \n\nAir thawing and freezing indexes (Ita and Ifa) were found to be highly correlated with \n\nelevation; Nt was found to have an inverse correlation with the presence of moss cover; Nf is \n\nmainly influenced by the terrain curvature; finally, the thermal offset showed the greater \n\ncorrelation index with the Topographical Wetness index. These results about the most \n\ninfluencing factors for each TTOP parameter based on the Spearman correlation indexes are \n\nclose to the previously expected in section 3.3.3.1. \n\nS1-Perma S2-Summit S3-Belowsummit S4-Saddle S5-Moraine S6-Midslope S7-mossrock S8-mossmoss S9-Lowdeep\n\nElevation (m) 198.12 335.78 317.82 289.79 165.62 136.53 71.34 71.67 37.53\n\nAspect N E N E N N N N N\n\nCurvature 8.20 -3.26 3.61 0.75 -11.25 -4.90 11.77 9.67 0.65\n\nMoss Cover No No No No No No No Yes No\n\nTWI 0.22 0.26 0.23 0.30 0.21 0.21 0.30 0.28 0.47\n\nSubstrate Type Bedrock Bedrock Bedrock\nUnconsolidated \n\nsoil\n\nUnconsolidated \n\nsoil\nBedrock Bedrock Peat Bedrock\n\nTable 11.

Hence, there is no knowledge on how \n\nSouth and West aspects influence in the TTOP parameters values. \n\n \n\n4.4 Relationship functions between terrain features and TTOP parameters \n\nThe sections below include the results of the statistical relationships functions between the \n\nterrain factors and model parameters which resulted to be highly correlated in previous \n\nsection. Included as well in this section is the analysis of results of the compliance test of the \n\nassumptions for applicability of single or multilinear relationships functions, previously \n\nexplained in section 3.3.3.4. \n\n4.4.1 THAWING AND FREEZING INDEXES \n\nTo understand how the indexes are correlated with altitude in Cierva Point and check for the \n\nfirst assumption of \u201clinearity\u201d, we plotted the resulting values of Ita and Itf for the 9 different \n\nlocations as a function of their altitude (Figures 46a and 46b). Similarly to the air temperature \n\ndecrease with elevation, thawing degree-days decrease with altitude as well. On the contrary, \n\nthe freezing degree-days increase with altitude.   \n\n \n\nFigure 46. a) Linear relationship between Ita and elevation. b) Linear relationship between Ifa and elevation. \n\na) b) \n\n\n\n  \n\n86 \n\n \n\nSecondly, we checked for normality of residuals in a normal P-P plot (Figures 47a and 47b). \n\nThe distribution is normal when conforms to the diagonal normality line y=x indicated in the \n\nplot (Statistical Solutions, 2018c). Sometimes, small deviations can be assumed as normality, \n\nas long as they are not drastic. In the figure below, the distribution of the residuals for both \n\ngraphs was close to the normality enough to consider the assumption compiled.  \n\n  \n\nThe next assumption to check was homoscedasticity (figures 48a and 48b). Ideally, in the \n\nscatter plot of residuals, the data should be scattered randomly, there are points equally \n\ndistributed above and below zero on the X axis, and to the left and right of zero on the Y axis. \n\nIn the scatter plots below, the data is randomly scattered and does not follow any obvious \n\npattern, so the assumption was considered valid.  \n\nFigure 47. a) Normal Predicted Probability (P-P) plot for Ita as a dependent variable of elevation. b) \n\nNormal Predicted Probability (P-P) plot for Ifa as a dependent variable of elevation. \n\na) b) \n\nFigure 48. a) Plot of standardized residuals versus predicted values when performing a linear regression between Ita and elevation. b) \n\nPlot of standardized residuals versus predicted values when performing a linear regression between Ita and elevation \n\na) b) \n\nhttp://www.statisticssolutions.com/testing-assumptions-of-linear-regression-in-spss/\n\n\n  \n\n87 \n\n \n\nFinally, the absence of multicollinearity should be checked using the Spearman correlation \n\nmatrix (correlations among all predictor variables should be less than 0.80) or the Variance \n\nInflation Factor (VIF), with values needing to be lower than 10. However, as we just used one \n\nindependent variable as a predictor for each model parameter it was not necessary to check for \n\nthis assumption to be compiled.  \n\nOnce all the assumptions were tested, the expressions that relate the thawing and freezing \n\nindexes as a function of elevation (Equations 13a and 13b) were determined, based on the \n\nobservational data collected in our study area. These functions are later used for the \n\nspatialization of the indexes in next section. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.4.2 N-FACTORS \n\nIn order to understand how the n factors are correlated with the moss cover and curvature and \n\nto check for the first assumption of \u201clinearity\u201d, we plotted the resulting values of nt and nf for \n\nthe 9 different locations as a function of moss-cover and curvature respectively (Figure 49a \n\nand 49b).  \n\n    \n\n?? =  ?0.627?(?????????) + 309.846 \n\nR2=0.67 \n\n?? =  1.602?(?????????) + 894.226 \n\nR2=0.67 \n\nEquation 13. a) Relationship function between Ita and elevation with respective estimation adjustment value of R2. \n\nb) Relationship function between Itf and elevation with respective estimation adjustment value of R2. \n\na) b) \n\nFigure 49. a) Relationship between nt and moss cover. In the x-axis, a value of 0 stands for the absence of a moss cover and a \n\nvalue of 1 for the presence. b) Linear relationship between nf and curvature. \n\n \n\nb) a) \n\n\n\n  \n\n88 \n\n \n\nIn the nt plot, the assumption \u201clinearity\u201d is violated, so simple linear regression cannot be \n\napplied to this parameter. However, a difference of 1.01 in the nt value was observed between \n\nadjacent monitoring sites 7-MossRock and 8-MossMoss (see Table 9), only differentiated by \n\nthe presence or absence of moss cover. Thus, a different method was exceptionally used for \n\nthe computation of relationship between nt and moss cover for the spatialization, as explained \n\nin section 3.3.3.4. The mean of nt values obtained in the moss-free monitoring sites (nt=2.08) \n\nwas given to the moss-free areas, whereas this mean value minus 1.01 (nt=1.07) was given to \n\nall the areas covered by mosses.  \n\nIn the nf to curvature scatterplot (Figure 49b), we observed a poor linear correlation, where \n\nthe nf values decrease with the increase of the curvature (i.e. the insulation of the top surface \n\nlayer increases as the concavity of the terrain does). This relation fits to the logics of potential \n\nrelationships mentioned in section 3.3.3.1, where concave surfaces were expected to have a \n\nhigher potential for the snowpack accumulation than convex surfaces.  \n\nSecondly, we checked for normality of residuals in a normal P-P plot for the nf-curvature \n\nrelation and observed an approximately normal distribution (Figure 50). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 50. Normal Predicted Probability (P-P) plot for nf as a dependent \n\nvariable of the terrain curvature. \n\n\n\n  \n\n89 \n\n \n\nFinally, we checked for homoscedasticity, with the scatter plot in Figure 51 showing a valid \n\ndistribution . \n\n \n\nOnce all the assumptions were tested, the relationship function between the thawing and \n\nfreezing n-factors and elevation was determined, based on the empirical data gathered in our \n\nstudy area (Equations 14a and 14b). These functions are used for the spatialization of these \n\nfactors in next section. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.4.3 THERMAL OFFSET \n\nSoil water content does not show the same influence on the ground thermal offset in different \n\nsubstrates. Therefore, the statistical relationships between the thermal offset and water content \n\n(represented as the Topographic Wetness Index - TWI) must be determined separately for \n\nbedrock and for peat and unconsolidated soils. \n\nFigure 51. Plot of standardized residuals versus predicted values when performing a linear regression \n\nbetween nf and curvature. \n\na) \n\nEquation 14. a) Values assigned for nt in moss free and moss covered areas respectively. b) Relationship function \n\nbetween nf and curvature with respective estimation adjustment value of R2. \n\n?? (?? ????) =  2.08 \n\n?? (???? ) = 1.07 \n\n?? = ?0.009?(?????????) + 0.728 \n\nR2=0.22 \n\n \n\nb) \n\n\n\n  \n\n90 \n\n \n\nFirst, it was plotted the absolute thermal offset values obtained in the monitoring boreholes in \n\nbedrock substrates (sites 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 9) as a function of the TWI (Figure 52a). Then the \n\nsame plot was implemented for thermal offset absolute values obtained in boreholes \n\ncharacterized by unconsolidated soils and peat substrates (4, 5 and 8) (Figure 52b). \n\n \n\nIn Figure 52a, we observed a direct relationship between the thermal offset in bedrock \n\nsubstrates and the moisture content, fitting the expected results as mentioned in section \n\n3.3.2.1, meaning that dryer bedrock (characterized by higher thermal conductivities) show \n\nlower absolute values of thermal offset (see Figure 28). In figure 52b, we observed an inverse \n\nrelationship between the thermal offset and TWI in unconsolidated soils and peat substrates. \n\nThese results fit the expected relation mentioned in section 3.3.3.1.C, moister soils and peat \n\n(with higher thermal conductivities than drier soils), show lower absolute values of thermal \n\noffset. \n\nWe checked for normality of residuals in a normal P-P plot as well for both substrate classes \n\n(Figures 53a and 53b). These plots showed an approximately normal distribution. \n\nFigure 52. a) Linear relationship between toffset and the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) in bedrock areas.  \n\nb) Linear relationship between toffset and the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) in unconsolidated soils or peat areas. \n\na) b) \n\n\n\n  \n\n91 \n\n \n\n \n\nFinally, we checked for homoscedasticity in Figures 54a and 54b that do not show a clear \n\npattern. Thus, the distribution was considered homoscedastic. \n\nOnce all the assumptions were tested, the expressions that relate the thermal offsets as a \n\nfunction of the TWI were determined, based on the empirical data gathered in our study area \n\n(Equation 15a and 15b). These functions were used for the spatialization of the thermal offset \n\nin next section all over the study area. \n\nFigure 54. a) Plot of standardized residuals versus predicted values when performing a linear regression between thermal offset and \n\nTWI in bedrock areas. b) Plot of standardized residuals versus predicted values when performing a linear regression between \n\nthermal offset and TWI in unconsolidated soils and peat areas. \n\n \n\nFigure 53. a) Normal Predicted Probability (P-P) plot for thermal offset as a dependent variable of the \n\nTopographic Wetness Index (TWI) in bedrock areas. b) for thermal offset as a dependent variable of the \n\nTopographic Wetness Index (TWI) in unconsolidated soils and peat areas. \n\na) b) \n\n\n\n  \n\n92 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.5 Spatial distribution of TTOP parameters and the TTOP spatial model. \n\nOnce determined the statistical relationships of the TTOP parameters with different terrain \n\nfeatures, which results are presented in section 4.4, we computed the Equations 13 to 15 over \n\nthe study area. The results are shown in Figures 55 to 59.  \n\n \n\nFigure 55.

As expected, the \n\nthawing and freezing air indexes decrease and increase respectively with the altitude in our \n\narea of study. N-thawing factor is mainly influenced by the presence or absence of moss. This \n\nfactor\u2019s value gets an average value of 1.07 in the locations covered by at least 5 cm moss and \n\ngets an average value of 2.08 in the moss-free areas. \n\nThe n-freezing factor drops in the areas with higher propensity to snowpack accumulation (i.e. \n\nmore concave areas), due to the insulator properties of the snowpack. \n\nThe thermal offset is the result of applying two different linear reggresion functions, one for \n\neach different kind of ground substrate (i.e bedrock or unconsolidated /peat soils). The \n\nabsolute value of the thermal offset increases in wetter areas when the substrate is bedrock, \n\nbut decreases in saturated areas when the substrates are unconsolidated soils or peats. \n\n \n\nIn the final distribution of the TTOP (Figure 60), values attain lower values in higher altitudes \n\nand at unconsolidated soils and peat deposits covered by moss, rather than at lower altitude \n\nand bare bedrock areas. Moreover, the TTOP shows its maximum values, higher than 0 \u00baC \n\nand up to 3.5\u00b0C,  in potentially moist areas (matching with TWI?1 values in Figure 34), \n\ncharacterized, as well, by a concave topography. This means that in these areas (accounting \n\nfor aproximately 12% of the total area), permafrost is absent and the TTOP stands for the \n\ntemperature at the base of the seasonally thawing layer. The reason is probably related to the \n\nhigh thermal conductivity of water (which encourage to total thaw of the saturated ground in \n\nthe summer, when the air temperatures reach positive values) and with the higher potential for \n\nsnowpack accumulation. The minimum values of the modelled TTOP (down to -6.33\u00b0C) were \n\nfound in the most convex areas. In these areas, the total exposition of the ground to the winds \n\nand solar radiation minimizes the chances of snowpack accumulation during the winter \n\nseason, leaving the bare surface exposed to heat loss during the freezing season. In summer, \n\nthe buffer effect of the moss formations would insulate the frozen ground dificulting to gain \n\nheat from the solar radiation. This facts characterize these locations with high values of n-\n\nfreezing fator and low values of n-thawing factor respectively, which in fact accounts \n\nnegatively in the TTOP model equation (Equation 2), inducing lower lower values of TTOP. \n\n\n\n  \n\n96 \n\n \n\nFigure 60.

It shows, as well, the \n\nvalue of local error in the estimation of the spatial parameters for each monitoring site. The \n\ndifference between the observed and modelled values of air thawing and freezing indexes (i.e. \n\nthe error of spatialization of these parameters) ranged between approximately 6 and \n\n122\u00b0Cdays in Site 4 and Site 1 respectively. The maximum error found in the spatial \n\nestimation of n-freezing factor was 2.24 in Site 2 and the best estimation of this parameter \n\noccurred in Sites 7 and 8 (nt error = 0.08). The higher error in the spatialization of the \n\nfreezing n-factor is observed in Site 4 (nf error= 0.13) and the lowest occur in Site 2 with an \n\nerror of 0.06.  \n\nSites 1 and 6 present the poorest estimations of thermal offset (error of 0.33\u00b0C), being Site 4 \n\ncharacterized by the best estimation with an error of 0.02\u00b0C. \n\nFinally, the maximum and minimum spatial estimation errors in the TTOP were found in Site \n\n6 (0.51\u00b0C) and Site 1 (0.02\u00b0C), respectively. \n\n \n\nOn the other hand, Table 14 compiles the mean measurement uncertainties and show them in \n\ncontrast with the mean estimation error of each parameter for all the boreholes. The mean \n\nerror of the spatial estimation for all the parameters is, in general, smaller than the \n\nmeasurement uncertainty in the observed data, except for the nt factor, where the error \n\nexceeded the measurement uncertainty in 0.24 \u00baC. However, the overall estimation error of \n\nthe spatial distribution of TTOP, after computing the Equation 2 all over the study area, was \n\n\u00b10.32 \u00baC, 0.18 \u00baC smaller than the mean thermistor measurement uncertainty of the observed \n\nTTOP (\u00b10.50 \u00baC). As this magnitude of the mean overall spatial estimation error of the final \n\nTTOP model falls inside the margins of the measurement uncertainty, the estimation was \n\nconsidered good enough for the validation of the TTOP spatial model results. \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n98 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.7 Permafrost sensitivity to climate change in Cierva Point \n\nIn order to evaluate the potential permafrost spatial sensitivity to climate change, it was \n\nimplemented a TTOP model for a hypothetical scenario, where long-term mean annual air \n\ntemperatures increase 1 \u00baC disregarding changes in any other topo-climatic factor, such as the \n\nseasonal snow pack, moss distribution or soil moisture content, as explained in section 3.5. \n\nThe results of the distribution of the new TTOP is shown in Figure 61. \n\n \n\nSite1 Site2 Site3 Site4 Site5 Site6 Site7 Site8 Site9\n\nobserved 118.40\u00b154.50 112.50\u00b154.50 121.47\u00b154.50 133.81\u00b154.50 147.82\u00b154.50 334.90\u00b154.50 304.71\u00b154.50 304.71\u00b154.50 230.64\u00b154.50\n\nspatial estimation 185.62 99.31 110.57 128.15 206.00 224.87 265.02 264.91 286.31\n\nAbsolute local error 67.22 13.19 10.90 5.66 58.18 110.03 39.69 39.80 55.67\n\nobserved 1333.40\u00b1124.5 1422.11\u00b1124.5 1369.56\u00b1124.5 1368.48\u00b1124.5 1198.87\u00b1124.5 1049.60\u00b1124.5 988.20\u00b1124.5 988.20\u00b1124.5 1002.76\u00b1124.5\n\nspatial estimation 1211.62 1432.15 1403.37 1358.47 1159.55 1111.35 1008.74 1009.03 954.36\n\nAbsolute local error 121.78 10.04 33.81 10.01 39.32 61.75 20.54 20.83 48.40\n\nobserved 1.43\u00b10.52 4.32\u00b10.60 1.89\u00b10.69 1.52\u00b10.68 2.19\u00b10.40 0.87\u00b10.35 2.00\u00b10.27 0.99\u00b10.19 2.38\u00b10.34\n\nspatial estimation 2.08 2.08 2.08 2.08 2.08 2.08 2.08 1.07 2.08\n\nAbsolute local error 0.65 2.24 0.19 0.56 0.11 1.21 0.08 0.08 1.09\n\nobserved 0.55\u00b10.13 0.82\u00b10.19 0.74\u00b10.21 0.59\u00b10.25 0.91\u00b10.12 0.60\u00b10.32 0.74\u00b10.30 0.76\u00b10.14 0.85\u00b10.27\n\nspatial estimation 0.65 0.76 0.66 0.72 0.83 0.77 0.62 0.64 0.73\n\nAbsolute local error 0.11 0.06 0.08 0.13 0.08 0.17 0.12 0.12 0.12\n\nobserved/estimated 0.38\u00b10.20 -0.35\u00b11.00 -0.24\u00b11.00 0.06\u00b11.00 -0.7\u00b11.00 0.23\u00b11.00 0.15\u00b11.00 -0.1\u00b11.00 1.1\u00b11.00\n\nspatial estimation 0.05 -0.04 -0.04 0.08 -0.67 -0.1 0.22 -0.07 1.02\n\nAbsolute local error 0.33 0.31 0.2 0.02 0.03 0.33 0.07 0.03 0.08\n\nobserved/estimated -1.21\u00b10.1 -2.25\u00b10.50 -2.42\u00b10.50 -1.61\u00b10.50 -2.59\u00b10.50 -0.69\u00b10.50 -0.18\u00b10.50 -1.35\u00b10.50 0.32\u00b10.50\n\nspatial estimation -1.41 -2.59 -1.97 -1.91 -2.15 -1.2 -0.23 -1.2 0.72\n\nAbsolute local error 0.2 0.34 0.45 0.3 0.44 0.51 0.05 0.15 0.4\n\nToffset (\u00b0C)\n\nTTOP (\u00b0C)\n\nIta (\u00b0C)\n\nIfa (\u00b0C)\n\nnt\n\nnf\n\nTable 13.

For each specific monitoring site, the TTOP values modelled in \n\nboth different scenarios are labelled: 1. before the climate change (in the upper left of each \n\nsite), and 2. After the MAAT increased 1 \u00baC (in bold to the right of each site). Sites 1,2,3,4,5 \n\nand 8, even though increased its values, still maintained negative temperatures at the \n\npermafrost table after the variance. However, the temperature at the top of permafrost in sites \n\n6 and 7 increased above 0 \u00baC suggesting the potential disappearance of permafrost in these \n\nsites. Resulting positive TTOP values for these sites after the increment of the MAAT stand \n\nfor the temperature at the base of the seasonal freezing and thawing layer (Way &amp; \n\nLewkowicz, 2016), under which the ground does not freeze anymore during the winter time. \n\nIn site 9, permafrost was absent before the increment of temperature and still remained absent \n\nin the second scenario. \n\n \n\nIn order to simplify the visualization of the TTOP model distribution in both case scenarios, \n\nboth maps where reclassified in two different sectors: areas with TTOP &lt;0 \u00baC and areas with \n\nTTOP > 0 \u00baC (Figures 62a and 62b). Even though the depth of the permafrost table is \n\nunknown in most of them, areas with TTOP &lt;0 \u00baC in both scenarios represent areas where \n\npermafrost is estimated to be present. Positive TTOP values correspond to cases where the \n\nground still freezes and thaws seasonally, but where no permafrost occurs.  \n\nIn the scenario 1, most of the study area (around 88%) shows negative values of TTOP and \n\nthus indicate presence of permafrost. Permafrost-free areas, where TTOP resulted positive, \n\nare a minority (around 12%), that mainly occur in areas characterized by higher Topographic \n\nWetness Indexes and high moisture contents (characterized by higher thermal conductivities \n\nthat dry soils).  \n\nWhen comparing with the second scenario (Figure 62b), a significant increase of the \n\npermafrost free areas is observed, almost the 50% of the permafrost in scenario 1 would \n\ndisappear. Figure 63 shows the TTOP changes from scenario 1 to 2. Blue areas account for \n\nthe 43% of the total area of interest and represent the regions where permafrost was found \n\nwith TTOP &lt;0 \u00baC in scenario 1 and still remained negative after the warming. Red colour \n\ndesignates the permafrost free areas (TTOP > 0 \u00baC) in scenario 1 that remained permafrost-\n\nfree (with positive TTOP) after the climate change, and account for the 12% of the area. \n\nFinally, brown areas represent the regions where permafrost was present (TTOP &lt;0 \u00baC) in \n\nscenario 1, but disappeared as a consequence of the climate warming in scenario 2 (45%).  \n\n\n\n  \n\n101 \n\n \n\nThe TTOP values in almost all the study area were estimated to increase in average 1.18 \u00baC as \n\na consequence of the air temperature forcing.  \n\n \n\nThe areas showing a higher increase in the TTOP, and thus the most sensitive to the air \n\ntemperature change, were the ones at lower altitudes with bare ground surfaces and/or high \n\nconcavity. The absence of moss covers makes these areas noticeably exposed to warming \n\nduring the summer, when solar radiation is directly absorbed by the ground. The thicker \n\nsnowpack associated to the concavity, provides better insulation during winter, reducing heat \n\nlosses and contributing to ground warming. The areas which still maintained permafrost after \n\nthe air temperature increase, were mainly those at higher altitudes or the areas with a moss \n\nbed insulating the ground from the summer warming. Permafrost remains present in areas of \n\nconvex topography as well, where a low potential of snow cover, leaves the ground exposed \n\nto high of heat losses during the winter. \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n102 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 62. a) Spatial distribution of TTOP classified separately in positive and negative TTOPs. b) Spatial \n\ndistribution of TTOP considering an increment of 1 \u00baC in the long-term MAAT.

Conclusions \n\nIn order to evaluate permafrost climate sensitivity at Cierva Point, the ground temperature \n\nregimes in nine sites were analysed and the spatial distribution of the Temperature at the Top \n\nOf Permafrost (TTOP) was modelled.  \n\nBy analysing the temperature regime for the sites where observational data was available \n\nthanks to nine boreholes, permafrost was observed at depths in the range from 0.4 to 5 m \n\ndepending on substrate, topographical and vegetation characteristics. At the deepest borehole \n\nin bedrock, in a site with slightly convex terrain, north aspect and at 198 m altitude, \n\npermafrost was found at 5 m and showed a mean annual temperature of -1.2 \u00baC. In a convex \n\nmoraine area, at 166 m and north aspect, permafrost was found at 1 m depth and the \n\nTemperature at the Top of Permafrost was -2.6 \u00baC. In a low elevation site at 72 m, \n\ncharacterized by 40 cm of moss cover over a peat substrate, permafrost was found at 0.4 m, \n\nright below the moss layer with a TTOP of -1.4 \u00baC. \n\nIn general, the estimated depths of the top of permafrost were found to be deeper (and the \n\nseasonal thawing layer thicker) in bedrock sites, followed by unconsolidated soils and peat \n\nsubstrates. In one of the monitored sites in bedrock and characterized by the highest wetness \n\nindex value and located at the lowest elevation (36 m), the temperature profile suggests the \n\nabsence of permafrost and sets the temperature at the top of the seasonally thawing and \n\nfreezing layer at 0.32 \u00b0C. \n\nThe ground temperature profile of the deepest borehole (15m) and its comparison with the air \n\ntemperature regime provided some insights on the thermal impact of the snowpack on the \n\nground surface temperature in this representative site. Some differences were found in the \n\nthermal offset values between the air and the surface during the first monitoring period from \n\n2012-2014 and the second monitoring period from 2016-2018. In the first period, the ground \n\nsurface thermal regime showed a stronger decoupling from the cold air temperatures in the \n\nwinter time, while from 2016-2018 the surface thermal regime was found to be strongly \n\ncoupled with the atmosphere. Also, the zero-curtain effect was observed to be shorter in the \n\nspring of 2015 and 2017 in comparison with previous years. These observations may reflect a \n\nlonger lasting and thicker snowpack accumulation during the winter seasons of 2012 and \n\n2013, which would have provided a stronger insulation to the surface for longer than the \n\nthinner snowpack in 2016-2018. An observed reduction of the active layer thickness in this \n\nsite during the first two years of the dataset could be also explained by this fact. This \n\n\n\n  \n\n105 \n\n \n\nobservation is in agreement with previous observations in nearby regions reporting a \n\nreduction of the active layer thickness in ice-free areas of the South Shetland Islands between \n\n2006 and 2014, linked with episodes of longer lasting and thicker snowpack accumulation the \n\nsurface (Goyanes et al., 2014; Ramos et al., 2017; de Pablo et al., 2017). \n\nThe spatial modelling of the distribution of the TTOP parameters over Cierva Point, showed \n\nthat the air thawing and freezing indexes were observed to decrease and increase respectively \n\nwith the altitude, being somehow related with the adiabatic lapse rate. N-thawing factor \n\nvalues were lower in locations covered by moss formations than in bare soils and bedrock. \n\nThe n-freezing factor was found to drop in the areas with higher potential snowpack \n\naccumulation (i.e. more concave areas). Both these results are explained by the buffer effect \n\nof the moss cover and the snowpack, which act as good thermal insulators (specially during \n\nthe winter season in the case of the latter). The absolute values of the spatially modelled \n\nthermal offsets showed an increase (larger difference between TTOP and mean annual surface \n\ntemperatures) in moist areas where the substrate is bedrock, but a decrease in saturated areas, \n\nwhere the substrate are unconsolidated soils or peats. Reasons for this, may be the higher \n\nthermal conductivity of peats and soils when they are wet, rather that dry, and of bedrock, \n\nwhen dry.  \n\nValues resulting from the final distribution of the Temperature in the Top of Permafrost \n\n(TTOP) were lower in higher altitudes and at unconsolidated soils and peat deposits covered \n\nby moss, rather than at lower altitude and bare bedrock areas. Moreover, the TTOP shows its \n\nmaximum values (above 0 \u00baC and up to 3.5 \u00b0C),  in potentially moist areas, characterized as \n\nwell by concave topography. This means that in these areas, permafrost is absent and the \n\nTTOP will stand for the temperature at the base of the seasonal thawing layer. The reason is \n\nprobably related to the high thermal conductivity of water (which promotes the total thaw of \n\nthe saturated ground in the summer, when the air temperatures reach positive values) and with \n\nthe higher potential for snowpack accumulation (which acts as a thermal insulator layer, \n\nreducing heat losses in winter).  \n\nLow values of TTOP were found, as well, in the most convex areas covered by moss \n\nformations. In these areas, the total exposition of the ground to the winds and solar radiation \n\nminimizes the chances of snowpack accumulation during the cold season, leaving the bare \n\nsurface exposed to significant heat losses. In summer, the buffer effect of the moss formations \n\ninsulates the frozen ground limiting heat gains from solar radiation. These characterize are \n\ntypical of the locations with high values of n-freezing factor and low values of n-thawing \n\n\n\n  \n\n106 \n\n \n\nfactor, respectively, which in fact, account negatively in the TTOP model equation (Equation \n\n2), inducing its lower values. \n\nThe overall estimation error of the spatial distribution of TTOP after computing the TTOP \n\nmodel equation over the study area, was \u00b10.32 \u00baC, and hence 0.18 \u00baC below the mean \n\nthermistor measurement uncertainty of the observed TTOP (\u00b10.50 \u00baC). As this magnitude of \n\nthe mean overall spatial estimation error of the final TTOP model falls inside the margins of \n\nthe measurement uncertainty, the estimation was considered good enough for the validation of \n\nthe TTOP spatial model results. This estimation error magnitude accounts somehow for the \n\nhigh small-scale variability of terrain features combined with a small sample size of \n\nmonitoring points (i.e. lack of repetition for observed data in moss-covered areas with \n\nunderlying peats), that together with high temperature measurement uncertainties, creates a \n\nhigh probability of relation due to randomness in the estimation of statistical relationships. \n\nConsequently, continuous functions like the regression models used in this method, that do \n\nnot account for this random variability at smaller scales, are sometimes likely to fail when \n\ntrying to explain the variability of the TTOP parameters at the 1 m/pixel resolution local scale \n\nof the study area. Hence, in future developments, other less restrictive estimation methods \n\nsuch as regression tree analysis could be alternatively applied as included in other studies \n\n(Anderton et al., 2004; Watson et al., 2006). \n\nFinally, analysing the TTOP distribution in the hypothetical scenario of climate change, with \n\na long-term mean annual air temperature increase of 1 \u00baC and disregarding changes in any \n\nother topoclimatic factors, a significant reduction of the TTOP values in the area was \n\nobserved. The results suggest the disappearance of nearly the 50% of the permafrost estimated \n\nto currently exist in Cierva Point. \n\nThe areas showing a higher increase in the TTOP, and resulted to be the most sensitive to the \n\nair temperature change, were the ones at lower altitudes, characterized by bare ground \n\nsurfaces and/or high concavity. The absence of a moss cover makes these areas noticeably \n\nexposed to the increase of temperature during the summer, when solar radiation is directly \n\nabsorbed by the ground. However, a thicker snowpack linked to the concave topography \n\nprovides better insulation during the winter reducing heat loses and contributing ground \n\nwarming. The areas which still maintained underlying permafrost after the air temperature \n\nincrease, were those at high altitudes and or the areas counting with a top moss bed cover \n\ninsulating the ground from the increment of temperature during the summer. Concave areas \n\n\n\n  \n\n107 \n\n \n\nalso maintained underlain permafrost as a low potential of snow cover, leaves the ground \n\nexposed to high rates of heat loses during the winter. \n\n \n\nThe disappearance of permafrost areas in Cierva Point may lead to significant impacts in the \n\narea\u2019s ecosystem, especially on hydrology and consequently in flora and fauna. The results of \n\na 1 \u00baC warming suggest the potential degradation of permafrost mainly at low and mid \n\naltitude areas, covering mostly all the areas with the greatest accumulation of moss and lichen \n\ncolonies and penguin activity nowadays. Permafrost presence is of uppermost importance for \n\nthe hydrology of the area, as the impermeable properties of the permanent frozen ground \n\npromote the pooling of rain and melt water on the surface making possible its existence. The \n\nthawing of permafrost in wetland areas would therefore increase the water infiltration through \n\nthicker soils and permeable joints, reducing the superficial water flow available for moss \n\ncommunities in the area as well. As an example, the three current existing temporary ponds \n\nlocated at the northwest side of the peninsula, situated at around 80 m altitude, may lower its \n\nwater table resulting in possibly impacts on the penguin high activity occurring in these areas \n\nas well. Flora and fauna are consequently very vulnerable to changes in the permafrost \n\ndistribution in Cierva Point.  \n\n \n\nThe permafrost model developed in this dissertation provides interesting insights about the \n\ncurrent situation and future scenarios of ground temperatures. However, it must be taken into \n\naccount that the model implements parameterizations on soil, vegetation and climate data, \n\nwhich encompass broad uncertainties, as land cover, soil characteristics are estimated on a \n\ncoarse scale and interpolated for large areas.  Besides, using longer periods of dataset for the \n\ncomputation of the model may reflect a closer reality of TTOP values over the past years (as \n\nthe final dataset used for the computation of the model was reduced to 2 years long due to the \n\ndiscontinuity of the records over the full period from 2012 to 2018). Moreover, permafrost is \n\ncontrolled by local topo-climatic factors, which may vary over small scales. The magnitude of \n\nthe estimation error accounts somehow for the high small-scale variability of these \n\ntopoclimatic features combined with a small sample size of monitoring points (i.e. lack of \n\nrepetition for observed data in moss-covered areas with underlying peats). This creates a high \n\nprobability of relation due to randomness in the estimation of statistical relationships between \n\nTTOP parameters and terrain features. Consequently, continuous functions like the regression \n\nmodels used in this method, that do not account for this random variability at smaller scales, \n\nare sometimes under the risk of failing when trying to explain the variability of the TTOP \n\n\n\n  \n\n108 \n\n \n\nparameters at small scales such as the 1m/pixel resolution local scale used in this project. \n\nTherefore, large sample datasets are crucial in order to reproduce the state of the art and future \n\nground temperature regimes in permafrost regions (Solheim, 2016). \n\nIn order to improve the precision of the model carried out in this dissertation and increase the \n\ndataset quality in future investigation lines, still new monitoring sites could be set up to record \n\ntemperatures over longer continuous time periods. However, this is a logistical complex issue \n\nand also costly, accounting for the very remote location of Cierva Point. \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n- 1 - \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nAduda, B.O. (1996).
