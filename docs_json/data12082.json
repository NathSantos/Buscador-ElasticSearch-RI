Contudo, v\u00e1rios esfor\u00e7os est\u00e3o a ser feito para \n\ncompreender em profundidade os fundos marinhos dos Oceanos. Atualmente, o m\u00e9todo mais \n\neficiente, j\u00e1 desenvolvido, para explorar a profundeza dos oceanos \u00e9 conhecido como ve\u00edculos \n\nsubmarinos, e especificamente, o mais eficiente para pesquisa e explora\u00e7\u00e3o destes \u00e9 conhecido \n\ncomo Ve\u00edculo Aut\u00f3nomo Subaqu\u00e1tico (AUV). O aumento do uso de AUV\u2019s tem levado a um ponto \n\nem que os par\u00e2metros de projeto s\u00e3o cruciais. Caracter\u00edsticas como a resist\u00eancia ao avan\u00e7o, o \n\nalto tempo de opera\u00e7\u00e3o, a grande manobrabilidade e o grande alcance s\u00e3o exigidos numa fase \n\nprim\u00e1ria de projeto; desta forma, \u00e9 fundamental encontrar uma forma \u00f3tima do corpo \n\nhidrodin\u00e2mico, ainda durante a fase de projeto, ambicionando melhorar as suas caracter\u00edsticas. \n\nEsta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o apresenta o efeito das for\u00e7as hidrodin\u00e2micas de ve\u00edculos subaqu\u00e1ticos axi- \n\nsim\u00e9tricos atrav\u00e9s da varia\u00e7\u00e3o da forma de um corpo em forma de torpedo. Al\u00e9m disso, nesta \n\ndisserta\u00e7\u00e3o pretende-se ainda analisar, experimentalmente, os r\u00e1cios comprimento/di\u00e2metro \n\ndo nariz e da cauda do corpo, assim como as suas formas, para que seja poss\u00edvel os r\u00e1cios e \n\ncombina\u00e7\u00e3o \u00f3timos do ponto de vista da minimiza\u00e7\u00e3o da resist\u00eancia ao avan\u00e7o. Os testes \n\nexperimentais foram feitos num tanque de \u00e1gua da Universidade da Beira Interior (UBI). No \n\nentanto, devido \u00e0s dimens\u00f5es do tanque de \u00e1gua, o desenvolvimento de um modelo \u00e0 escala \n\nfoi a op\u00e7\u00e3o mais vi\u00e1vel. Uma similaridade entre o modelo \u00e0 escala e o prot\u00f3tipo foi feita para \n\ngarantir as mesmas condi\u00e7\u00f5es de escoamento entre ambos. V\u00e1rias combina\u00e7\u00f5es foram testadas \n\nexperimentalmente e seguidamente validadas por simula\u00e7\u00f5es num\u00e9ricas. Adicionalmente, \n\npar\u00e2metros como o \u00e2ngulo de ataque (de 0 - 20?) e a velocidade (entre 0.50 \u2013 1 m/s) foram \n\nalterados para perceber a sua influ\u00eancia na resist\u00eancia hidrodin\u00e2mica. A prepara\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nexperimental \u00e9 totalmente descrita, mostrando v\u00e1rios procedimentos adotados at\u00e9 \u00e0 fase de \n\nrecolha de dados. Um sistema de tens\u00e3o/compress\u00e3o (c\u00e9lula de carga) foi utilizado para medir \n\na resist\u00eancia induzido pelo corpo. Os resultados experimentais demonstraram uma configura\u00e7\u00e3o \n\n\u00f3tima que se situa nas proximidades de N/D = 0.8 (Forma El\u00edtica) e T/D = 1.6 (Forma C\u00f3nica). \n\nPode ser visto que a resist\u00eancia aumenta com o aumento da velocidade. Da mesma forma para \n\nos \u00e2ngulos de ataque, a resist\u00eancia aumenta para \u00e2ngulos de ataque maiores. Os dados \n\nexperimentais foram usados para validar os resultados obtidos de um software CFD que usa as \n\nequa\u00e7\u00f5es RANS. Um estudo de independ\u00eancia da malha foi feito para investigar dois modelos \n\nturbulentos: Modelos Standard ?-? e ?-? SST.  O modelo turbulento Standard ?-? mostrou ser o \n\nmais apropriado para este estudo com um menor custo computacional. Os resultados entre os \n\nm\u00e9todos experimentais e num\u00e9ricos mostraram uma boa concord\u00e2ncia, considerando as \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es mencionadas. \n\nPalavras-chave \n\nVe\u00edculo Aut\u00f3nomo Subaqu\u00e1tico (AUV), for\u00e7a de resist\u00eancia ao avan\u00e7o, Din\u00e2mica de Flu\u00eddos \nComputacional (CFD), totalmente submerso, hull body, Nariz, Cauda, Modelos Turbulentos.    \n\n\n\n \n\n viii \n\n\n\n \n\n ix \n\nAbstract \n\nNowadays, it is not fully clear how the Ocean seabed can contribute to Earth ecosystems. \n\nHowever, several steps are being taken to completely understand Ocean\u2019s seabed. Lately, many \n\nmethods are being developed to explore the Oceans, although there is one method which fulfill \n\nthe desired trade-off (between low operational costs and high quality data collection). This \n\nefficient method developed to explore the Ocean\u2019s depth is known as submarine vehicles, and \n\nthe most efficient of them, to explore and mapping, is certainly the Autonomous Underwater \n\nVehicle (AUV). The increasing use of AUV\u2019s is leading to a point in which its design parameters \n\nare crucial. Characteristics as high endurance, long operation time, high maneuverability and \n\nrange are demanded at an early design stage; thus, it is essential to find an optimum hull shape \n\ndesign to improve these characteristics. This thesis presents the effect of hydrodynamic forces \n\nof axisymmetric underwater vehicles through the variation of the shape of a torpedo-shaped \n\nhull body. Furthermore, this thesis is intended to analyze, experimentally, the length-to-\n\nDiameter (D) ratios of nose (N) and tail (T), as well as its shapes, in order to find the optimum \n\nratios and shape combinations for the minimization of Drag. The experimental tests were \n\nconducted in the towing tank of the University of Beira Interior (UBI).  However, due to the \n\nTowing Tank dimensions, the development of a scaled model had to be made. A similarity \n\nbetween the scaled model and the full-scale prototype must be done to assume similar flow \n\nconditions. Several torpedo-shaped combinations were tested experimentally and further \n\nvalidated the numerical simulations. Moreover, parameters such as the pitch angles (or Angle \n\nof Attack (AoA)) [0 - 20?] and velocities [0.50 \u2013 1 m/s] were investigated to understand their \n\ninfluence on the hydrodynamic Drag. The experimental setup is hereby fully described, showing \n\nthe various procedures adopted until the data collection phase. A strain gauge system (load \n\ncell) was used to measure the Drag induced by the hull body. Experimental results demonstrate \n\nan optimum configuration for N/D = 0.8 (Elliptical shape) and T/D = 1.6 (Conical shape). From \n\nthe experimental and numerical data, it could be seen that the Drag increases with the increase \n\nof velocity. Same occurrence happens for AoA, where Drag increases with higher AoA\u2019s. \n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that the influence of AoA on Drag is higher for greater velocities. \n\nThe experimental measurements have been used to validate results obtained from a \n\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software that uses Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes (RANS) \n\nequations (ANSYSTM FLUENT). A mesh-independency study was made to investigate two \n\nturbulence models: Standard ?-? and ?-? SST models. Standard ?-? showed to be the most \n\nappropriate model to this study with a lower computational cost. Results between Experimental \n\nand Numerical methods showed a good agreement, considering the conditions mentioned. \n\nKeywords \n\nAutonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), Drag (DT), Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), fully \n\nsubmerged, hull body, Nose, Tail, Turbulence Models.  \n\n\n\n \n\n x \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n xi \n\nContents \n\n1 Introduction ............................................................................................ 1 \n\n1.1 Motivation .......................................................................................... 1 \n\n1.2 Research Objectives and Aim .................................................................. 2 \n\n1.3 Research Strategy and Document Structure ................................................. 3 \n\n2 Literature Review and Significant Theory ....................................................... 7 \n\n2.1 History .............................................................................................. 7 \n\n2.2 Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV\u2019s)................................................... 12 \n\n2.3 Autonomous Underwater Vehicles \u2013 Design and Concepts .............................. 13 \n\n2.4 General Design of an AUV ..................................................................... 14 \n\n2.4.1 Hydrodynamic Design ....................................................................... 14 \n\n2.4.2 Hull Shape .................................................................................... 18 \n\n2.4.3 Restrictions to the flow around the model ............................................. 19 \n\n2.5 Fluid Mechanics Foundations ................................................................. 22 \n\n2.6 Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) \u2013 Numerical Approach ........................... 23 \n\n2.7 Turbulence models ............................................................................. 24 \n\n2.7.1 Standard ?-? model ......................................................................... 25 \n\n2.7.2 ?-?

It is certain that the ocean covers more than 2/3 of the Earth\u2019s surface, being a \n\nfundamental reason of human\u2019s existence on Earth. Moreover, the average depth of the ocean \n\nis 3680 meters and the greatest ocean depth of the oceans is found in Mariana\u2019s trench, with \n\n10911 m depth. However, only about 5% of the oceans bottoms have been explored [1]. \n\nTherefore, it is extremely important to explore as much as possible this unknown area and \n\nunderstand how oceans can improve human lives. The collection of ocean data by observation \n\nand tracking in actual sea is crucial.  \n\nIn order to understand the ocean, several tools have been used in the offshore industry since \n\nthe late 1960s. These tools must comply with certain characteristics to carry out their functions \n\n[2]. Lately, tools as Human Occupied Vehicles (HOV\u2019s), Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV\u2019s) \n\nand Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV\u2019s) are being used for an extensive and complex \n\nstudy of the oceans, revolutionizing the process of gathering ocean data [1], [3]. However, the \n\nrelative high cost of using instruments lowered from research ships (HOV\u2019s) or tethered robots \n\n(ROV\u2019s) and their limitations such as the need for a communications tether or an operating \n\nvessel have limited their use. Consequently, AUV\u2019s became a common tool in ocean sampling \n\nby being independent, and are now an indispensable feature for collecting ocean data providing \n\na safe, cost-effective and reliable alternative to manned or remotely controlled systems [4]\u2013\n\n[7]. \n\nIn recent years, AUV\u2019s are becoming a powerful tool in deep ocean research, being increasingly \n\nused in areas such as, the exploration of underwater environments, maintenance and repair of \n\nsubmerged structures, mineral exploration, military use, pipeline inspection, mine-sweeping \n\nand many other areas [8], [9]. These several distinct applications give rise to a large number \n\nof different vehicle shapes and sizes. The design of AUV\u2019s is conducted by a demanding tradeoff \n\nbetween the crucial requirements of the missions, and the main constraints of fabrication, \n\nassembly and operational logistics. However, an AUV is limited when power requirements are \n\nconcerned, which directly impacts its characteristics, such as velocity, range and endurance of \n\nthe vehicle [6], [10]. Thus, it is crucial to find an efficient hydrodynamic design that reduce \n\npower consumption, and in turn, increase AUV\u2019s autonomy. In order to improve its performance \n\non a design project level, the reduction of hull\u2019s hydrodynamic resistance must be the main \n\n\n\nResearch Objectives and Aim  Chapter 1 \u2022 Introduction \n\n 2 \n\nfocus. Therefore, an increasing use of AUV\u2019s leads the need to investigate and predict, \n\nefficiently, the hydrodynamic forces acting over an AUV [11].  \n\nThis research thesis further analyzes, through the use of experimental and numerical methods, \n\nthe hydrodynamic forces and coefficients of an AUV with a torpedo shape operating under \n\ndeeply submerged conditions. The AUV model velocity, Angle of Attack (AoA), Nose Length / \n\nDiameter and Tail Length / Diameter ratios are investigated to study their effect on \n\nhydrodynamics performance of submerged vehicles. For this purpose, a detailed experimental \n\nprocedure has to be performed by a numerical study using a commercial Computational Fluid \n\nDynamics (CFD) tool, FLUENT ANSYS 16.0., being the ultimate goal of this thesis the validation \n\nof the numerical simulation against the experimental procedure, allowing for the optimization \n\nof the overall AUV body. \n\n1.2 Research Objectives and Aim \n\nCEiia - the Centre of Engineering and Product Development challenged the author of this thesis \n\nto study, experimentally and numerically, the hydrodynamic forces and coefficients of an AUV \n\nmodel based on MEDUSA DEEP-SEA AUV type. MEDUSA Deep-Sea AUV is a double-hull design that \n\nis currently being developed by a group of partners: CEiiA, Instituto de Sistemas e Rob\u00f3tica \n\n(ISR) from Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico (IST), The Portuguese Sea and Atmosphere Institute, I.P. \n\n(IPMA, IP), EMEPC (Estrutura de Miss\u00e3o para a Extens\u00e3o da Plataforma Continental) \n\n(governmental structure with a mission to prepare/monitor the process of extending the \n\ncontinental shelf of Portugal), Institute of Marine Research (IMAR) and Argus Remote Systems \n\nAS. This project embraces the design and production of a specific AUV for the required \n\nconditions imposed initially to operate at 3000 m of depth and with a specific payload. More \n\ndetails about this project are shown in reference [12]. Vehicle\u2019s configuration is shown in Figure \n\n1.1. This thesis is not a part of MEDUSA Deep-Sea project, being rather considered a parallel \n\nstudy which might help optimize this vehicle\u2019s hydrodynamic hull efficiency. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 \u2013 MEDUSA Deep-Sea Conceptual Design. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2022 Introduction  Research Strategy and Document Structure \n\n 3 \n\nThe following objectives were defined for this research: \n\n- Investigate the effects of velocity, AoA, Nose/Diameter and Tail/Diameter ratios \n\non the hydrodynamic forces and coefficients generated by an AUV hull form \n\noperating in a fully submerged depth condition; \n\n- Implement the experimental procedure to investigate the hydrodynamic forces and \n\ncoefficients; \n\n- Investigate the application of CFD numerical methods for predicting underwater \n\nvehicle\u2019s hydrodynamic coefficients; \n\n- Validate the numerical simulation process against the experimental testing results; \n\n- Identify optimum configurations and conditions for AUV\u2019s taking into consideration \n\nvehicle\u2019s velocity, AoA, Nose/Diameter and Tail/Diameter ratios. \n\nThe aim of this project is to validate the numerical simulation against the experimental \n\nprocedure (see Figure 1.2). For this purpose, the towing tank of UBI shall be set properly to do \n\nthe experiments and experimental data should be collected. The CFD tool shall be used to \n\nobtain numerical data to achieve the proposed objectives. \n\n1.3 Research Strategy and Document Structure \n\nThe research strategy undertaken in this project comprises the use of the following three \n\ninterrelated research tools: \n\n- Investigation through an extensive literature review to report on the relevant work \n\ncompleted by other authors, and support the experiment and numerical based \n\ninvestigations; \n\n- Investigation by experiment to observe, measure and register the hydrodynamic \n\nforces and calculate coefficients through data collected, of a fully submerged AUV \n\nhull form; \n\n- Investigate, implement, analyze and evaluate a CFD numerical simulation to predict \n\nthe resistance force and drag coefficient experienced by a fully submerged AUV \n\nmodel. \n\nThis document is structured in a coherent and logical manner. The description of each chapter \n\nwithin this document is presented below: \n\nChapter 1 introduces the motivation to the research problem, presents its aim and the research \n\nobjectives expected to be achieved during this study.  \n\nChapter 2 provides a literature review of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV\u2019s), the \n\nhydrodynamic phenomena environment of a submerged AUV body and the relevant \n\nexperimental and numerical research completed to date by other authors. \n\n\n\nResearch Strategy and Document Structure  Chapter 1 \u2022 Introduction \n\n 4 \n\nChapter 3 describes the specific case study of this thesis, as well as its requirements and \n\nparameters that are aimed to be studied.  \n\nChapter 4 presents the experimental procedure, including the experimental model design and \n\nits manufacturing, and experimental setup, used to calculate the forces of the AUV model \n\noperating without free surface and wall effect. It also presents the results of the experimental \n\ntests. \n\nChapter 5 discusses the CFD software used to simulate and predict the hydrodynamic forces \n\nand coefficients of the AUV model, assuming fully submerged depth condition. It also provides \n\nthe modelling and simulation methods adopted in this research, as well as its results. \n\nChapter 6 presents the conclusions drawn from the experimental procedure and numerical \n\nsimulation, the difficulties encountered during this thesis, and the areas which need further \n\ninvestigation. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2022 Introduction  Research Strategy and Document Structure \n\n 5 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 - Thesis structure flow diagram. \n\n \n\nLiterature Review \n\nCase Study \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nConclusions \n\n \n\nValidated? \n\nYes \n\nNo \n\n\n\nResearch Strategy and Document Structure  Chapter 1 \u2022 Introduction \n\n 6 \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2022 Literature Review and Significant Theory  History \n\n 7 \n\nChapter 2 \n\n \n\n2 Literature Review and Significant Theory \n\nIt is essential to understand background knowledge and fundamental milestones about the AUV \n\nhistory, as well as, similar studies made by other authors. It is also important to understand \n\nthe reasons for the underwater vehicle\u2019s shape at different phases of their development and \n\nsome notable achievements. \n\n2.1 History \n\nAUV\u2019s are directly linked to streamlined bodies, being the majority torpedo-shaped. The first \n\ntorpedo was invented by Robert Whitehead in Austria in 1866 [13], [14], but this concept only \n\nstarted being dominant and reliable since World War II (WWII) [15]. The name Torpedo came \n\nfrom the Torpedo fish, which is an electric ray capable of delivering a stunning shock to its \n\nprey. The torpedo can be considered the first AUV, if the fact that it carried an explosive \n\npayload is ignored. Furthermore, this torpedo achieved a speed of 3 m/s and ran around 700 m \n\n[16]. The torpedo-shaped is a crucial parameter for this study because it is straightly connected \n\nwith actual AUV\u2019s design. \n\nThe development of UUV\u2019s started in the 1960\u2019s and some initial research was made about the \n\nutility of UUV\u2019s. The first successful one was developed as early as 1957 in the Applied Physics \n\nLaboratory at the University of Washington to gather data from the Arctic regions. This UUV \n\nwas named as the Special Purpose Underwater Research Vehicle (SPURV I) and was subject of \n\nstudy until the mid 70\u2019s. Between the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s the SPURV II was adopted, an upgrade more \n\ncapable than SPURV I. Altogether were released over 400 SPURV [16], [17]. Table 2.1 shows \n\nsome of SPURV I\u2019s specifications. \n\n  \n\n\n\nHistory  Chapter 2 \u2022 Literature Review and Significant \nTheory \n\n 8 \n\nTable 2.1 - SPURV I Specifications (adapted from [18]). \n\nMaximum Depth 3600 [m] \n\nEndurance with LR 90 battery 5.5 hours (hr) \n\nInstrument Payload 45 [kg] \n\nSpeed 2-2.5 [m/s] \n\nDisplacement (sea water) 430 [kg] \n\nNet Buoyancy 9.1 [kg] \n\nOverall Length 3.1 [m] \n\nDiameter 0.508 [m] \n\nDive Rate 1.3 [m/s] \n\nClimb Rate 2.3 [m/s] \n\nTurn Rate 3 [?/s] \n\nAcoustic Tracking Range 2000 [m] \n\n \n\nIn 1973, the Naval Ocean System Center, now known as Space and Naval Warfare Systems \n\nCommand (SPAWAR) started to develop the Advanced Unmanned Search System (AUSS). This \n\nvehicle was ready for the first launch ten years later, in 1983. Had a displacement of 907 kg, \n\nwith 5,2 m long and 0,8 m of diameter, completed over 114 dives being some of them to 6000 \n\nm of depth [5], [16]. \n\nIn 1976, the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea (IFREMER) designed Epulard \n\nvehicle. This vehicle was assembled by 1978 and was operational for the first dive in 1980. It \n\nhad a maximum depth of 6000 m and was acoustically controlled, Epulard completed about 300 \n\ndives between 1970 and 1990 [16]. \n\nDuring the 70\u2019s, other AUV\u2019s were also developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \n\n(MIT). Later, in 1997, a group of engineers from the MIT AUV Laboratory founded BLUEFIN \n\nROBOTICS. This company develops, builds, and operates AUV\u2019s and related technologies. \n\nRecently, was acquired by General Dynamics Mission Systems, a business unit of General \n\nDynamics [19]. \n\nIn 1980, the \u201cInternational Symposium on Unmanned Untethered Submersible Technology\u201d \n\n(UUST) was created in Durham, New Hampshire, United States of America (USA), with twenty-\n\nfour technologist attending this conference. Seven years later, more than 320 people were \n\nrepresenting more than 100 companies, 20 Universities and 20 federal agencies on the meeting \n\n[17].  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2022 Literature Review and Significant Theory  History \n\n 9 \n\nDuring the 80\u2019s, there were many technological advances apart from AUV community that \n\ncritically improved AUV development. Improvements like software systems and size reduction \n\nof hardware systems were crucial. Following Busby\u2019s 1987 Undersea Vehicle Directory, there \n\nwere six operational AUV\u2019s and other 15 vehicles considered prototypes or under construction \n\nby 1987 [5], [16]. \n\nIn 1990, the HUGIN AUV program started in a project between KONGSBERG and the Norwegian \n\nDefence Research Establishment (FFI). Since its development has been the most capable and \n\nsuccessful commercial AUV in operation. Figure 2.1 shows the HUGIN AUV Product Range and \n\ntheir specifications [20], [21]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 \u2013 Specifications of several HUGIN AUV\u2019s [20]. \n\nIn the 90\u2019s, the first generation of operational systems able to be tasked to perform defined \n\nobjectives appeared, in other words, AUV\u2019s grew from proof of concept to a final result. \n\nTherewith, the interest in AUV\u2019s academic research increased quickly. \n\nDuring the 90\u2019s, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sea Grand AUV lab developed six \n\nOdyssey vehicles. These vehicles had a displacement of 160 kg, with an operational speed of \n\n\n\nHistory  Chapter 2 \u2022 Literature Review and Significant \nTheory \n\n 10 \n\n1.5 m/s, operating for up to six hours and were assigned to 6000 m of depth. In 1994, these \n\nvehicles operated under ice, and in 1995 operated for 3 hours in the open ocean to a depth of \n\n1400 m [16], [17]. \n\nAlmost at the same time, in the early 90\u2019s, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) \n\ndeveloped the Autonomous Benthic Explorer (ABE) (see Figure 2.2). ABE completed its first \n\nscientific mission in 1994, had a displacement of 680 kg and its dives typically lasted about 16 \n\nto 34 hours depending on the instrument payload and bottom terrain. This vehicle was the first \n\none to be completely independent of the surface vessel and capable of covering large areas of \n\nunderwater terrain. ABE was extremely maneuverable due to its six thrusters. Its deepest dive \n\nto date was  4000 m, in its at least 80 dives [5], [16]. Figure 2.2 demonstrates ABE AUV attached \n\nto the Launch And Recovering System (LARS). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 \u2013 ABE AUV during a mission (adapted from [1]). \n\nAt the same time, the South Hampton Oceanography Center\u2019s AUTOSUB was developed. \n\nAUTOSUB was the first vehicle prepared for long duration missions, having completed its first \n\nscientific mission in 1998. With a travelling speed of 1.5 m/s, it displaces 1700 kg and can \n\noperate for up to six days. This vehicle has completed over 270 missions covering more than \n\n3500 km. Its longest mission lasted 50 hours [5], [16]. \n\nIn the late 90\u2019s, WHOI\u2019s Remote Environmental Monitoring UnitS (REMUS) vehicle was developed \n\nin the Oceanographic Systems Lab (now marketed by Hydroid, owned by Kongsberg Group in \n\n2007) to support scientific objectives at the LEO-15 observatory in Tuckerton, New Jersey. Its \n\nfirst scientific mission was in 1997 and there are currently over 50 REMUS vehicles in 20 \n\ndifferent configurations that are being independently operated by universities and agencies, so \n\nit is not possible to determine how many missions have been performed by REMUS. With a \n\ndisplacement of 36 kg, it can operate for up to 20 hours at 1.5 m/s and to a depth of 100 m. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2022 Literature Review and Significant Theory  History \n\n 11 \n\nIts longest mission lasted 17 hours, with an operational speed of 1.75 m/s at a maximum depth \n\nof 20 m of the coast of New Jersey [1], [16]. The Figure 2.3 shows a recent version of a REMUS \n\nAUV, the REMUS 6000. This vehicle can operate in water depths up to 6000 m and its autonomy \n\ndepend on its speed/sensor configuration (typical mission duration is 22 hr). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 \u2013 REMUS 6000 operating near free surface (adapted from [22]). \n\nIn 1997, the HUGIN I AUV made the first commercial survey operation for the \u00c1sgard Gas \n\nTransport Pipeline Route. This is an important milestone for the AUV civilian application. This \n\nsurvey confirmed the expected improvements in efficiency and data quality by the use of AUV\u2019s. \n\nFrom 2001, these vehicles have been successfully used for military application [20]. \n\nIn 2004 the Navy UUV Master Plan was issued. This plan defines UUV missions in the following \n\nprioritized order [23]:  \n\n1. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance; \n\n2. Mine Countermeasures (MCM); \n\n3. Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW); \n\n4. Inspection/Identification; \n\n5. Oceanography; \n\n6. Communications/Navigation Network Node (CN3); \n\n7. Payload Delivery. \n\nThis UUV Master Plan is a document recommending AUV missions and technologies. \n\nSince the beginning of this century, it became clear that the use of AUV technology was of \n\ngreat value for several commercial tasks. There is a transitioning point in which AUV technology \n\nwill definitely move from the research environment into the commercial offshore industry. \n\nAlthough, there are some parameters to be performed, such as the economic viability of the \n\n\n\nUnmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV\u2019s)  Chapter 2 \u2022 Literature Review and Significant \nTheory \n\n 12 \n\ntechnology and some technological problems, to continue its advance for industry to embrace \n\nits potential. \n\nCurrently, there are many companies on the AUV industry such as Kongsberg Maritime (owner \n\nof the most-known brands as REMUS, HUGIN, MUNIN or SEAGLIDER), BLUEFIN ROBOTICS or \n\nInternational Submarine Engineering. These companies are being constantly supported by \n\nresearch institutions as WHOI, MIT AUV Laboratory or Kongsberg Group (two centuries business \n\ncompany, owner of Kongsberg Maritime) to expand this industry. \n\n2.2 Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV\u2019s) \n\nSince the main topic of this thesis is AUV\u2019s, it is not relevant to have an exhaustive study about \n\nall marine vehicles. However, it is extremely important to understand their global classification \n\nlike it is shown in Figure 2.4.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4 - Global classification of marine vehicles. \n\nUnmanned Vehicles can be described by dividing them into two categories: Underwater Vehicles \n\nand Surface Vehicles.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2022 Literature Review and Significant Theory  Autonomous Underwater Vehicles \u2013 Design and \nConcepts \n\n 13 \n\nThe Unmanned Surface Vehicles, most known as Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV\u2019s) are \n\nvehicles that only operate in the ocean\u2019s surface. Depending on its vessel, length and power \n\nsupply, they can operate for a considerable time (weeks or months). \n\nThe Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV\u2019s) are mainly separated into three categories: \n\nRemotely Operated Vehicle (ROV), Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and Autonomous \n\nUnderwater Glider (AUG). Depending on each specific task, the type of UUV should be chosen \n\nproperly. However, characteristics such as high endurance, long operation time, high \n\nmaneuverability and range are always desired. The relationships between those four \n\ncharacteristics are shown in Figure 2.5.    \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 - Relationship between Endurance, Time, Range and Maneuverability (adapted \n\nfrom [4]). \n\n2.3 Autonomous Underwater Vehicles \u2013 Design and Concepts \n\nThe design of an AUV depends on its mission and in a preliminary design concept it is highly \n\nimportant to understand which geometry/shape is better for the desired mission. \n\nNowadays, with the development of technology came the increase in the use of AUV\u2019s. Mainly, \n\nthere are three different types of applications for AUV\u2019s: \n\n- Commercial: directly linked with oil and gas industries; its traditional missions are \n\nthe mapping and tracking of the seafloor before construct any infrastructure, also \n\npipelines can be monitored easily. \n\n- Defense: obviously connected with defense or protection; this AUV application \n\ninvolve missions as mine detection, monitoring an area to identify unknown objects \n\nand detection of manned submarines (anti-submarine warfare). \n\n- Research: this is the pioneer application, came with the necessity to know the \n\nocean\u2019s life and study precisely new elements attached to the sea floor. \n\nDepending on each mission, there are several variables that can be changed during the \n\npreliminary design such as, for example, the AUV Length (L) and/or Diameter (D).  \n\n\n\nGeneral Design of an AUV  Chapter 2 \u2022 Literature Review and Significant \nTheory \n\n 14 \n\n2.4 General Design of an AUV \n\nThere are some aspects in AUV design that need special attention, and are known as major \n\ndesign aspects. These aspects include: hull design, propulsion, submerging and electric power \n\n[2]. Therefore, these aspects can be subdivided into several subsystems as [23]: \n\n- the pressure container; \n\n- the hydrodynamic hull; \n\n- ballasting; \n\n- power and energy; \n\n- electrical-power distribution; \n\n- propulsion; \n\n- navigation and positioning; \n\n- obstacle avoidance; \n\n- masts; \n\n- maneuver control; \n\n- communications; \n\n- locator and emergency equipment; \n\n- payloads. \n\nSince the aim of this thesis is to estimate/calculate the hydrodynamic forces/coefficients, it is \n\ncrucial to improve backgrounds in hull design, and specifically in hydrodynamic hull. For a \n\ndetailed study about the subsystems please refer to the references [2], [23]. \n\n2.4.1 Hydrodynamic Design \n\nAn AUV when travelling through the ocean should be highly hydrodynamic or as much as possible \n\nstreamlined. Frequently, the components housing defines several restrictions as minimum \n\nDiameter (cross-sectional area) or Length, and these restrictions directly affect the body\u2019s \n\nhydrodynamic. Reduce Drag (DT), or also known as Resistance Force (??), is always one of the \n\nmain design objectives. Moreover, the flow over an AUV\u2019s body should be controlled for an \n\nefficient propulsion i.e. laminar flow designs should be chosen  [23]. Maximum cross section \n\nfrom nose and nose/tail radius (same length with different curvature) are parameters that also \n\nhave influence on resistance force, but since they are not controllable due to the constraints \n\nof this study, will be neglected. The FR depends on a set of phenomena as can be shown in \n\nFigure 2.6. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2022 Literature Review and Significant Theory  General Design of an AUV \n\n 15 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6 \u2013 Resistance Force decomposition (adapted from [24]). \n\nThis resistance force is represented by the relationship presented in Equation (2.1) \n\n ?? =  \n1\n\n2\n. ? . ??  . ?\n\n2 . ? (2.1) \n\nWhere ? is density, ?? the Drag coefficient, U is the model velocity and ? the wetted surface \n\narea.  \n\nFollowing the equation above, the Drag coefficient is given by the Equation (2.2), \n\n ?? =  \n??\n\n?.\n1\n2\n\n. ?2. ?\n (2.2) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nGeneral Design of an AUV  Chapter 2 \u2022 Literature Review and Significant \nTheory \n\n 16 \n\nWhere all parameters are known from the Equation (2.1). The author considered relevant to \n\ndescribe these two similar equations, since these are fundamental for this study. \n\nGenerally, the resistance force can be divided into three different components: form drag or \n\npressure drag (also known as viscous pressure resistance), friction resistance and wave \n\nresistance. Since this study is for a fully submerged mode i.e. there is no free surface effect. \n\nKnowing that the main difference between submerged mode and surfaced mode is wave-\n\nbreaking and wave-making, the wave resistance is neglected in the scope of this study. To \n\nunderstand the influence of free surface effect (two-phase flow condition) see E. Dawson [25]. \n\nHenceforth, a fully submerged condition is always assumed by the author. Therefore, there are \n\ntwo dominant factors responsible by the submerged body\u2019s resistance to motion when moving \n\nin a homogenous viscous fluid domain: friction resistance (tangential shear forces) and viscous \n\npressure resistance (normal pressure forces) resistance, as marked in Figure 2.6. \n\nThe friction resistance coefficient is given by the Equation (2.3): \n\n ?? =  \n0.075\n\n(log10 ?? ? 2)\n2\n (2.3) \n\nWhere ??  is the non-dimensional frictional resistance coefficient and ?? is the Reynolds \n\nnumber. Knowing ??  and ??  (given in Equation (2.2))  the Residual Drag coefficient (??) can be \n\nobtained from the Equation (2.4): \n\n ?? =  ?? ? ??  (2.4) \n\nThe residual drag is a significant parameter for hydrodynamic studies defined as total resistance \n\nexcept for skin friction drag. \n\nThe influence of each component on resistance force is dependent on the size and shape of the \n\nbody, as shown in Figure 2.7. There is no precise minimum in total drag but various authors \n\nrefer an optimum L/D ratio for a streamlined body is between 6 and 7. This optimum value \n\nchanges depending on its shape. In order to reduce the form resistance, the hull length can be \n\nextended. However, the resultant increase in length and wetted surface area leads to an \n\nincrease in friction resistance. Then, the effects of L/D ratio on the two components are \n\ncontradictory, where the lowest point of total resistance force is related to the optimum L/D \n\nratio, as shown in Figure 2.7. \n\nReynolds number (??), mentioned in Equation (2.3), is an essential parameter used on this \n\nthesis for dynamic similarity between the full-scale AUV prototype and hull model used for this \n\nstudy. To assume similar flow conditions, applied on this case, the Reynolds number needs to \n\nbe the same for both scales i.e. Reynold\u2019s law must be ensured (the inertial and frictional \n\nforces are present). For a constant kinematic viscosity (?), the smaller the models mean the \n\nhigher speed, and forces do not scale down for constant viscosity. However, this similarity is \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2022 Literature Review and Significant Theory  General Design of an AUV \n\n 17 \n\nonly valid when fluid properties of both scales are the same. Due to Reynolds number appears \n\nin RANS equations, it has an effect on all flows governed by these equations. Reynolds Number \n\n(hereinafter, Reynolds Number is going to referred as Re) is defined by the ratio of the fluid\u2019s \n\ninertia forces to the viscous forces in the boundary layer of the fluid and it is given by the \n\nEquation (2.5), \n\n ?? =  \n?. ?\n?\n?\n\n (2.5) \n\nWhere ? is absolute viscosity and ? the characteristic linear dimension. The denominator is also \n\nknown as (Equation (2.6)), \n\n ? =  \n?\n\n?\n (2.6) \n\nConsecutively, the Reynold\u2019s similarity is represented by the Equations (2.7) and (2.8), \n\n (??)? =  (??)? (2.7) \n\n \n\n ?? =  ??. (\n??\n??\n\n) (2.8) \n\nWhere the subscript M represents Model and P the full-scale Prototype. \n\nSince ?? appears in several applications, ? represents one of many length scales. The transition \n\npoint (point which the boundary layer changes from laminar to turbulent) is dependent of ?? \n\ni.e. as Re increases, this point moves forward on the surface [26]\u2013[29]. \n\n Another parameter which influences resistance of the streamlined body is the prismatic \n\ncoefficient (??), that describes the amount of volume on the ends of the body. It is formed as \n\n\u201cthe ratio of the displaced volume with that contained in a prism formed by the mid-ship cross-\n\nsectional area and the length\u201d[30]. An optimum ?? value is around 0.6 [25], [31]. The ?? is \n\ndefined as (Equation (2.9)): \n\n ?? =  \n?\n\n?\n4\n\n .  ?2  . ?\n (2.9) \n\nWhere ? is the volume of the envelope, ? the maximum hull diameter and ? the body\u2019s length. \n\nAccording to Joubert [30], reducing both L/D ratio and ?? \u201cshould give a reduction in total \n\nresistance coefficient of over eight percent.\u201d. \n\n\n\nGeneral Design of an AUV  Chapter 2 \u2022 Literature Review and Significant \nTheory \n\n 18 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7 \u2013 Resistance force components for a streamlined body with constant volume in an \n\ninfinite fluid domain at constant velocity (adapted from [25]). \n\nThe viscous pressure drag varies along the body\u2019s surface, being its biggest value at the nose \n\n(called stagnation point), where the streamlines divide through the body. The pressure is \n\nsmaller when the streamlines are straight, and rises when are diverging. In an ideal fluid (fluid \n\nwith no viscosity), the nose and tail pressure would be the same i.e. the integral of all pressures \n\nacting on the body\u2019s surface would be zero [25], [31]. \n\nHowever, in a real fluid, the viscosity is an important property that causes tangential force or \n\nfriction resistance. This phenomenon occurs due to the interaction between the fluid and the \n\nbody, and the formation of a fluid boundary layer around the body\u2019s surface. The boundary \n\nlayer depends on the relative velocity, location along the body\u2019s length and the effects of local \n\npressure gradients. The flow along the boundary layer can be either laminar or turbulent with \n\na transitional region dividing the two [25], [31]. A detailed description of boundary layer is \n\npresented by [32], [33]. \n\n2.4.2 Hull Shape \n\nAccording to the given backgrounds above, it is extremely important to choose the most \n\nefficient hull shape in order to get the lowest drag possible.  \n\nMainly, two types of axisymmetric bodies were considered, these seem to be admitted by all \n\nauthors with similar studies [8], [24], [34], [35]. These bodies are shown in Figure 2.8. A round \n\nhull presents no stress concentrations and when compared to other shapes is able to withstand \n\nmore pressure, except for the spherical form. The spherical form is not considered on this \n\nstudy, even though being the most effective hydrodynamic shape. There are some aspects as \n\nstrength, maneuverability, form resistance (L/D ratio = 1), propulsive efficiency or power \n\nhousing requirements that makes this form an unfeasible option [36]. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2022 Literature Review and Significant Theory  General Design of an AUV \n\n 19 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8 - Axisymmetric hull shapes (adapted from [31]). \n\nOn Figure 2.8 (a) the shape presented is, known as the teardrop shape, this is the most ideal \n\nshape for submerged mode. Although, due to several issues on its construction and power \n\nhousing requirements, the most conventional and applied form on AUV\u2019s is the parallel mid-\n\nbody form (Figure 2.8 (b)). The nose and tail form, can be elliptical, conical or even parabolic. \n\n2.4.3 Restrictions to the flow around the model \n\nDepending on the model\u2019s and tank size, there are some differences when an AUV model is \n\ntowed in a towing tank or in the unrestricted water. These differences are usually referred to \n\nas the boundary effects. It may be classified into Wall Effect, Free surface effect and Blockage \n\nEffect [37]. \n\nThe blockage ratio is defined as \u201cthe ratio of the maximum cross sectional area of the model \n\nto that of the towing tank.\u201d [37]. Following this definition, the Blockage ratio is given by the \n\nEquation (2.10), \n\n ?? =\n?\n\n??\n (2.10) \n\nWhere ? is the maximum cross sectional area of the model and ?? the maximum cross sectional \n\narea of the towing tank. \n\nWall Effect only depends on tank\u2019s width. A combination of limited width and depth is known \n\nas the Blockage Effect. This phenomenon is rather complex due to the interference of the tank \n\nsides and bottom i.e. model size has to be sufficiently small to avoid inherent hydrodynamic \n\ninterference, and this is called reflected wave interference effects. Unfortunately, a model \n\ntoo small leads to additional inaccuracies on the quality of results obtained due to the similarity \n\nbetween the full scale prototype and the model test [37]. As a result, the largest model with \n\n\n\nGeneral Design of an AUV  Chapter 2 \u2022 Literature Review and Significant \nTheory \n\n 20 \n\nminimum interference induced must be found. During the last years, the International Towing \n\nTank Conference (ITTC) [38] made a recommendation for finding a blockage correction, \n\nalthough there is a lack of literature available. The blockage ratio is the most important \n\nparameter of the blockage effect. Marine Renewables Infrastructure Networks (MARINET) [39] \n\nrefer blockage ratio above 0.1 can introduce questionable results, whereas H.Kim and J.Moss \n\n[37] present a lower limit of blockage ratio below which the blockage effect has normally been \n\nconsidered to be insignificant is 0.006. However, MARINET also refer cases which wave making \n\nis small, could be used larger models with the appropriate correction for the remaining blockage \n\neffect [37], [39], [40]. \n\nAs described previously, AUV\u2019s have two modes of navigation: surfaced mode and submerged \n\nmode. In surface mode, the wave resistance (divided into two components: wave breaking and \n\nwave making) is a main part of resistance (up to 50%) of total resistance. Although, this thesis \n\nis only based on the submerged mode, however, to travel under water, it is important to know \n\nat which depth is the interference of free surface negligible i.e. the wave resistance is minimum \n\nand can be neglected [24], [35]. There are several studies to find this fully submerged \n\ncondition. \n\nHoerner and Weinblum et al. [25] concluded that for submergence depth-to-diameter ratios of \n\nat least 5 (H* = 5.00) the wave resistance could be neglected, where H* is defined as (Equation \n\n(2.11), \n\n ?? =  \n?\n\n?\n (2.11) \n\nBeing ? the submergence depth of an axisymmetric body\u2019s longitudinal centerline below the \n\nstill waterline and ? the maximum diameter. \n\nThere are other authors that connected the fully submerged depth with maximum diameter or \n\nlength of submersible hull. According to Moonesun et al. [24] several authors used different \n\nsubmerged depths for their studies as, ? = ?/2, ? = 3? or ? = 5?. Figure 2.9 shows the effect \n\nof the submergence depth on Drag Coefficient. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2022 Literature Review and Significant Theory  General Design of an AUV \n\n 21 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9 - Total resistance coefficient vs Submergence depth (adapted from [24]). \n\nMoreover, Moonesun et al. [24] compares this submergence depth with Froude number (??) and \n\nconcludes that it is an important parameter in the evaluation of submergence depth. Also \n\nconcludes that exists one \u201cMilestone depth\u201d where wave resistance decreases more than 80% \n\nand other where there is no wave resistance called \u201cFully submerged depth\u201d, as shown by the \n\nreferences above and as can be seen in Figure 2.10. Further, this author refers the \u201cfully \n\nsubmerged depth for high Froude numbers is equal to 4.5D.\u201d and the \u201cmilestone depth for high \n\nFroude numbers is equal to 0.125L.\u201d. Moonesun et al. [24] presented the Froude number as a \n\ncrucial parameter to study submergence depth, showing that for ?? &lt;0.5 were considered \n\nordinary values and for ?? > 0.7 high values. These statements are supported by Figure 2.10. \n\nThe Froude number appears in two-phase flow conditions (problems involving pressure \n\nboundary conditions) and it is only important for determining which depth there is no wave \n\nresistance. Since this thesis focus on one-phase flow condition, Froude number is only helpful \n\nto comprehend which depth is the fully submerged condition i.e. this means that if there is no \n\nfree surface, this parameter is insignificant, as well as Weber and cavitation number \n\n(insignificant numbers for this thesis) [26], [28]. ?? is given by the Equation (2.12). \n\n ?? =  \n?\n\n???\n (2.12) \n\nWhere ? is the acceleration due to gravity, and ? is the waterline length of the vessel. \n\n\n\nFluid Mechanics Foundations  Chapter 2 \u2022 Literature Review and Significant \nTheory \n\n 22 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.10 - According Moonesun et al., Milestone and fully submergence depth for all Froude \n\nnumbers (adapted from [24]). \n\n2.5 Fluid Mechanics Foundations \n\nBefore examining the methods of Computational Fluid Dynamics, a review of the governing \n\nequations of fluid mechanics must be done. \n\nThe fluid is defined by the ratio of specific heats (?), viscosity (?) and the coefficient of heat \n\nconduction (?). The motion of the fluid is controlled by governing equations and boundary \n\nconditions. Based on conservation laws, the governing equations of fluid mechanics are given \n\nby: \n\n- Mass conservation equation or continuity equation (mass can be neither created nor \n\ndestroyed); \n\n- Momentum conservation equation (Newton\u2019s 2nd Law); \n\n- Energy conservation equation (based on the 1st law of Thermodynamics). \n\nAll details of these equations (considerations and forms) are fully described at references [41], \n\n[42]. Hence, only the final equations will be demonstrated. \n\nThe conservation of mass can be described as the net outflow of mass through the surface \n\nsurrounding the volume has to equal to the time rate of decrease of mass inside control volume. \n\nThe differential form of continuity equation (vector form) is given by the Equation (2.13): \n\n \n??\n\n??\n+  ? . (? . ? ) = 0 (2.13) \n\nWhere ? is the time, ? is fluid velocity vector (?, ?, w) and \n?\n\n??\n=  \n\n?\n\n??\n+ ? . ? is the material \n\nderivative that represents the rate of change following a fluid particle [43], [44]. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2022 Literature Review and Significant Theory  Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) \u2013 \nNumerical Approach \n\n 23 \n\nThe momentum conservation equation, based on Newton\u2019s 2nd law of motion, is represented by \n\nthe Equation (2.14), which represents the net force action on a system has to be equal to the \n\ntime rate of change of momentum of system. \n\n ?\n???\n??\n\n=  ??? +  \n????\n\n???\n (2.14) \n\nWhere ?? is the component of the mass force per unit mass second in the ? direction, ???  are the \n\nstress components, and ?, ? = (1,2,3), i.e. a matrix 3x3 of stress components. Assuming a \n\nNewtonian fluid (where the stress components are linear to the derivatives), a relation between \n\nvelocity filed and stress components can be made, as shown in Equation (2.15) [44]. \n\n ??? = (?? ?\n2\n\n3\n?\n\n???\n???\n\n) ??? +  ? (\n???\n???\n\n+\n???\n\n???\n) (2.15) \n\nWhere ? is the viscosity coefficient, ???  is the Kronecker delta function, ? is the pressure and ? \n\na dummy variable summed from 1 to 3. Replacing the stress components of Equation (2.15) into \n\nthe Equation (2.14), the Navier-Stokes equations are achieved, as demonstrated in Equation \n\n(2.16). \n\n ?

(\n\n???\n???\n\n+\n???\n\n???\n) (2.16) \n\nFinally, to complete the system of equations comes the energy conservation equation, which \n\nstates the 1st Law of Thermodynamics: \u201cThe sum of the work and heat added to a system will \n\nequal the increase of energy.\u201d[45]. There are several forms of this equation in literature, the \n\nEquation (2.17) is one of these forms. \n\n \n??(? +\n\n1\n2\n\n? 2)\n\n??\n= ?. (???) ? ???w \n\n(2.17) \n\nWhere ? is the coefficient of thermal conductivity, ? is the internal energy per unit mass, ? is \n\nthe temperature gradient, w is the vector of work associated with each control volume face \n\nand ????w =  ??? the work done on the system [46]. \n\n2.6 Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) \u2013 Numerical Approach \n\nThe behavior of viscous fluid flow is described by Navier-Stokes Equations (Equation (2.16)). \n\nFluid flow, in of the majority of the cases, is turbulent. Turbulent flows have as particular \n\ncharacteristic: transportation of quantities, as momentum, energy, and species concentration, \n\nwith fluctuation (hardest case to solve, small scale and high frequency) [47], [48]. These \n\ncomplex equations need to be solved numerically by the use of computational methods, except \n\nfor very simple cases. All of these computational, theoretical and numerical methods are known \n\nas Computational Fluid Dynamics.  \n\n\n\nTurbulence models  Chapter 2 \u2022 Literature Review and Significant \nTheory \n\n 24 \n\nThe computational fluid mechanics techniques use the Eulerian approach to solve all \n\napplications. However, Navier-Stokes equations varies with time, which denotes that is \n\nrequired averaging multiple solutions at a set of time steps [49]. This leads to a decomposition \n\nof Navier-Stokes equation into the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. \n\nFurthermore, RANS equations introduces to a several unknowns (Reynolds stress) that requires \n\na turbulence model to generate a closed system of solvable equations, i.e. turbulence model \n\nis used to close the system of mean flow equations [49].  \n\nRANS equations are the most widely used approach, although there are other approaches that \n\ncan simulate with higher precision, as Large Eddy Simulation (LES) or Direct Numerical \n\nSimulation (DNS). LES solves the spatially averaged RANS equations, directly resolving larger \n\neddies, but modelling small ones. However, due to the computational requirements it is not a \n\nfeasible option. DNS solves the full RANS equations, simulating with accuracy all turbulent flows \n\n(all eddies included) without requiring turbulence models. However, this approach is not \n\npractical for engineering purposes, due to extremely high costs and computational resources \n\nrequired [50]. A more detailed study about this topic can be made by checking of references \n\n[29], [31], [42], [51] . \n\n2.7 Turbulence models \n\nSince this study comprises the use of a well-known commercial software called ANSYS FLUENT, \n\nit will be described the turbulence models related to this tool. \n\nTherefore, the turbulent models provided by ANSYS FLUENT are: \n\n- Spalart-Allmaras model (one-equation model); \n\n- ?-? models (two-equation model) \n\n- Standard ?-? model; \n\no Renormalization-group (RNG) ?-? model; \n\no Realizable ?-? model. \n\n- ?-? models (two-equation model) \n\no Standard ?-? model; \n\no Shear-stress transport (SST) ?-? model. \n\n- Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) (seven-equation model); \n\n- Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model. \n\nIt is important to understand \u201cthat no single turbulence model is universally accepted as being \n\nsuperior for all classes of problems\u201d [50]. So, depending on purpose/necessity and \n\ncomputational resources/time efficiency the choice of turbulence model should be made. \n\nFollowing this procedure and the ideas reached by literature review, two models will be \n\ndescribed. These turbulence models are: Standard ?-? and ?-? SST models. A detailed \n\ninformation about these models or other turbulence models are fully presented in [42], [50]. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2022 Literature Review and Significant Theory  Similar studies \n\n 25 \n\n2.7.1 Standard ?-? model \n\nThis is the most used turbulence model in engineering for industrial applications. It is known as \n\nbeing robust, economic and with a satisfactory accuracy for turbulent flows. As referred above \n\nthis is a two-equation model, which allows to calculate the turbulent length and time scale by \n\nsolving two transport equations. These equations are for turbulence kinetic energy (?) and \n\ndissipation rate (?). A limitation of this turbulent model is that it is only valid for fully turbulent \n\nflows. Further, at near-wall regions, wall functions must be used, due to ? equation. Although, \n\nseveral improvements were implemented on Standard ?-? model, resulting in examples as ?-? \n\nRNG model or ?-? Realizable model, but as referred previously, a trade-off of \n\npurpose/computational resources should be made before choosing a turbulent model [48]. \n\n2.7.2 ?-? SST model \n\nThis turbulence model is considered an \u201cupgrade\u201d of Standard ?-?. Furthermore, it was \n\ndeveloped to have the benefits of ?-? model (near-wall region) and ?-? model (freestream \n\nindependence in the far field). The ? equation integrates a damped cross-diffusion derivative \n\nterm. The consideration of the transport effects of the principal turbulent shear stress led to a \n\nmodified turbulent viscosity formulation [42], [50]. \n\n2.8 Similar studies \n\nMansoorzadeh and Javanmard [52] presented the free surface effect on drag and lift \n\ncoefficients of an AUV by comparing two-phase flow numerical simulation with single phase \n\nflow simulation and the experimental procedure. The study was performed at several \n\nsubmergence depths for 1.5 and 2.5 m/s. The study demonstrated that, for both AUV speeds, \n\nthe influence of free surface on drag coefficient was decreasing as the model distance from \n\nthe free surface was increasing. A maximum difference of 10% between the numerical and \n\nexperimental results for drag coefficient was observed. These authors concluded that it is not \n\nvery straightforward to compare which method is more accurate, since there are errors and \n\nuncertainties associated with each one. Although, collecting data from both methods and \n\ncompare them seemed to conclude better results.  \n\nJ.L.D. Dantas and E.A. de Barros [11] investigated the hydrodynamic forces and coefficients \n\nobtained by an AUV with control surface deflection and angle of attack by the use of CFD \n\nsoftware based on the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. These authors \n\nconducted their CFD simulations separately (AUV bare hull and control surface), to better \n\npredict each interference and compare with experimental results obtained in a towing tank. \n\nThey concluded that the k-? SST turbulent model was the best model to predict hydrodynamic \n\ncoefficients and the nonlinear regression methodology is the best choice for predicting the stall \n\nat control surface.  \n\n\n\nSimilar studies  Chapter 2 \u2022 Literature Review and Significant \nTheory \n\n 26 \n\nFor these experimental results done by J.L.D Dantas and E.A. de Barros [11], Lucas et al. [53] \n\nused strain gauge type dynamometers to measure hydrodynamic efforts of an AUV with the \n\nsame external geometry used by Maya AUV, with a diameter of 0.234 m and a total length of \n\n1.742 m, at a longitudinal velocity of 1 m/s. In order to measure hydrodynamic forces and \n\nmoments, experiments were made for each sideslip angle, adopting some struts configurations \n\nto reduce its influence in results (Drag and hydrodynamic effects). Experiments indicated, in \n\nthe normal force case, an insignificant difference using the fairing structure. The results are \n\nshown in Figure 2.11 with a comparison of the results obtained by other author (Jorgensen) \n\nwith similar study [8]. Furthermore, De Barros, Dantas, Pascoal and De S\u00e1 [54] used some of \n\nthese results to create a new application methodology of semi-empirical prediction models. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.11 \u2013 Comparison of normal force coefficient (a); hydrodynamic center (b) and pitch \n\nmoment (c) between towing tank results and Jorgensen results (adapted from [8]). \n\nPraveen P.C. and Krishnankutty P. [34] studied the hydrodynamic forces of axisymmetric UUV\u2019s \n\nby varying vehicle\u2019s length due to angle of attack, for a bare hull configuration, by performing \n\nVertical Planar Motion Mechanism (VPMM) experimental tests, using CFD code FLUENT 6.2. for \n\nnumerical simulations and doing the same Analytical and Semi-Empirical (ASE) method that De \n\nBarros, Dantas, Pascoal and De S\u00e1 used [54]. Their numerical and experimental results were \n\nconverging and the empirical method seemed to be very good to predict linear coefficients. \n\nResults show that the linear coefficients vary linearly with L/D. \n\nP.Jagadeesh and K.Murali [55] studied four low Reynolds number k-? models to predicting the \n\nhydrodynamic forces of AUV\u2019s. These authors demonstrated that the k-? Abe-Nagano-Kondoh \n\n(AKN) turbulent model revealed to predict more closely the flow separation and wake formation \n\nin comparison to the other models considered. This turbulent model has also shown a better \n\nhydrodynamic coefficients prediction when compared with other models.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2022 Literature Review and Significant Theory  Similar studies \n\n 27 \n\nP.Jagadeesh, K.Murali and V.G.Idichandy [56] performed an experimental study on \n\nhydrodynamic forces and moments of an AUV model in the vertical plane to observe its variation \n\nwith Reynolds number and angle of attack. To validate these results, CFD ANSYS FLUENT with \n\nRANS equations was used. Using the Froude scaling, a model scale ratio was selected. The \n\nturbulence model k-? AKN showed to be a good option for predicting hydrodynamic forces and \n\ncoefficients of AUV\u2019s. It was also shown that there was a maximum increase in normal force \n\ncoefficient compared to axial force coefficient under the same conditions (velocity and angle \n\nof attack). Equally, for the pitching moment, lift and drag coefficients there is an increase of \n\nthese values.  \n\nAlam, Ray and Anavatti [57] presented empirical and numerical (CFD ANSYS FLUENT 13.0.) \n\nmethods to estimate the drag of an AUV. The range of flow speed varied from 0.5 to 3.0 m/s, \n\nwith a range of Reynolds number of 6.5 x 105 to 3.89 x 106. The turbulent model used by authors \n\nwas the realizable k-? model with enhanced wall treatment. Results show good agreement with \n\nempirical estimation, although drag differences between the empirical and CFD results increase \n\nat high velocities (10.80% at a flow speed of 3.0 m/s). \n\nMoonesun, Javadi, Charmdooz and Mikahailovich [35] presented a detailed experimental \n\nprocedure to test a model scale ratio of 1:32 of the prototype vehicle. Since the scale was too \n\nhigh, Reynolds number similarity was unfeasible. Therefore, the authors adopted four other \n\nmethods for scaling, found depth which there is no free surface effects (five times the model\u2019s \n\ndiameter) and a CFD simulation was made to compare. To predict which was the best method, \n\nauthors made a comparison between model tests and the other five tests (four empirical \n\nestimations and one numerical simulation). CFD simulation showed the best results for hull and \n\nappendages analyses (10% of error at a speed of 12 knots). \n\nKunz et al. [58] conducted an expedition called the Artic GAkkel Vents Expedition (AGAVE) to \n\nfurther investigate marine biology, chemistry and geology associated with hydrothermal venting \n\nat Gakkel Ridge. Two AUV\u2019s (Jaguar and Puma), differing only in their sensor payload, were \n\ndesigned to perform the task of collecting images and samples of the deep seafloor. These \n\nAUV\u2019s are based on Seabed design and performed a total of nine dives at depths of up to 4062 \n\nm. Authors concluded that \u201cthe fundamental requirement for reliable acoustic communications \n\nshould be taken as a starting point for future development of sub-ice vehicles.\u201d. \n\nIn fact, this is not directly connected to the topic of this thesis. However, the AUV\u2019s (Jaguar \n\nand Puma) geometries are similar to the prototype that this thesis is based on. Consequently, \n\nit is pertinent to highlight a similar project and its mission; it can be seen as a guide.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nSimilar studies  Chapter 2 \u2022 Literature Review and Significant \nTheory \n\n 28 \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \u2022 Case Study  Requirements \n\n 29 \n\nChapter 3 \n\n \n\n3 Case Study \n\nIt is aimed to optimize the hydrodynamics of a single-hull body considered as representative of \n\nMEDUSA Deep-Sea lower-hull, in order to optimize the external vehicle shape for the operation \n\nconditions. Furthermore, an optimized external vehicle shape produces lower Drag force, which \n\nreduces the energy consumption of the vehicle, and consequently increases its autonomy.  As \n\nwell as MEDUSA Deep-Sea, the single-hull prototype is considered to operate in depths up to \n\n3000 m in ocean (salt water), i.e. resist to a pressure of at least 300 atm. Vehicle should also \n\nhold Temperatures up to a minimum of 0?C. \n\n3.1 Requirements \n\nThe prototype is also considered to operate in velocities between 0 and 3 m/s, with a nominal \n\noperation velocity of 1.5 m/s. Moreover, operating at its nominal operation velocity, the \n\nvehicle should not sustain operations at AoA\u2019s higher than 20?, being its nominal cruise \n\noperation at 0?.

These considered dimensions \n\nwere:  centre section diameter of 0.340 m and a length of 1.5 m.  \n\nAccording to the literature review and respecting the given design constraints, the most \n\nappropriate shape for the centre section is the cylindrical shape. In order to improve the \n\nhydrodynamics, nose and tail hydrodynamic fairings were included. These nose and tail sections \n\nwere studied to understand which shape specifically should be used. This study includes the \n\nelliptical and conical shapes for the nose and tail fairings. However, the properly nose and tail \n\nlength must be also found to fully optimize the hull prototype. Classification of the tail and \n\n\n\nDimensions and Shape  Chapter 3 \u2022 Case Study \n\n 30 \n\nnose shapes is done using an appropriate characteristic dimension ratio. N/D is the ratio of the \n\nnose length over the hull\u2019s diameter and T/D is the ratio of the tail length over the hull\u2019s \n\ndiameter. The Figure 3.1 shows all the hull\u2019s configurations studied. \n\n \nFigure 3.1 - Characteristics (dimensions, ratios and shapes) of all components of full-scale \n\nprototype used for this study.  \n\nNose Length (N) Length (L) \n\n1500 mm \n\nC\no\n\nn\nic\n\n \nE\n\nll\nip\n\nt\nic\n\n \n\nS\nH\n\nA\nP\n\nE\nS\n \n\nL EN G T H  R A T I O S  \n\nT/D: 1.6 \u2013 3.2 \n\n(Tail Length over Diameter ratio) \nN/D: 0.8 \u2013 2.4 \n\n(Nose Length over Diameter ratio) \n\nDiameter (D) \n\n340 mm \n\n \n\nTail Length (T) \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2022 Experimental Study  Experimental Model Design \n\n 31 \n\nChapter 4 \n\n \n\n4 Experimental Study \nIn this Chapter, the experimental procedure will be fully detailed, including the several \n\nconsiderations and steps made. Further, the results of the experimental tests will be shown, \n\ndemonstrating the tendencies obtained from the data collection. \n\n4.1 Experimental Model Design \n\n4.1.1 Dimensions \n\nDue to towing tank size (see Table 4.1), a full-scale single-hull model was an unfeasible option. \n\nTherefore, the first consideration taken to Model\u2019s Design was to find an optimum trade-off \n\nbetween model\u2019s and tank size, i.e. higher Model length can induce to Wall and Surface effects, \n\nand smaller Model length can induce to scale error effects (associated with scale ratio). Thus, \n\na LTOTAL/D ratio = 10 was defined as starting Design point. According to the authors referred \n\nabove, finding the largest model without wall and free surface interference must be a focus. \n\nFollowing these authors and knowing the size of the tank (Table 4.1), the depth for fully \n\nsubmerged condition has been calculated, as shown on the Tables (Table 4.2 &amp; Table 4.3) \n\nbelow. The difference between the Tables is only considering the diameter while measuring \n\nthe h, i.e. considering h from the hull\u2019s surface or body\u2019s longitudinal centerline. \n\nTable 4.1 \u2013 Towing tank dimensions. \n\nTowing Tank \n\nHeight [mm] 800 \n\nWidth [mm] 800 \n\nLength [mm] 12000 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nExperimental Model Design  Chapter 4 \u2022 Experimental Study \n\n 32 \n\nTable 4.2 - Model\u2019s parameters according full scale prototype (h considered since the body\u2019s \n\nlongitudinal centerline to water\u2019s surface). \n\n  \nFull -Scale  \nPrototype \n\nDepth \u2013-> h = 400 \u2013 D/2 [mm] \n\nL/2 3D 5D 4D 6D \n\nLengthTotal [mm] 2400.0 727.3 1142.9 727.3 888.9 615.4 \n\nDiameter [mm] 240.0 72.7 114.3 72.7 88.9 61.5 \n\nL/D ratio 10.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 \n\nLbody [mm] 1160.0 351.6 552.4 351.5 429.6 297.4 \n\nLnose [mm] 530.0 160.6 252.4 160.6 196.3 135.9 \n\nLtail [mm] 710.0 215.2 338.1 215.2 263.0 182.1 \n\nLNose/D 2.2 2.2 2.2 2.2 2.2 2.2 \n\nLTail/D 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 \n\nVelocity \u2013 V[m/s] \n\n0.3 0.8 0.5 0.8 0.7 1.0 \n\n0.5 1.7 1.1 1.7 1.4 2.0 \n\n0.8 2.5 1.6 2.5 2.0 3.0 \n\n1.0 3.3 2.1 3.3 2.7 3.9 \n\n1.3 4.1 2.6 4.1 3.4 4.9 \n\n1.5 5.0 3.2 5.0 4.1 5.9 \n\nH*  5.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 \n\n \n\nTable 4.3 - Model\u2019s parameters according full scale prototype (h considered since the body\u2019s \n\nsurface to water\u2019s surface). \n\n  \n\nMEDUSA_DP  \n(Lower Hull) \n\nDepth \u2013-> h = 400 [mm] \n\nL/2 3D 5D 4D 6D \n\nLengthTotal [mm] 2400.0 800.0 1333.3 800.0 1000.0 666.7 \n\nDiameter [mm] 240.0 80.0 133.3 80.0 100.0 66.7 \n\nL/D ratio 10.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 \n\nLbody [mm] 1160.0 386.7 644.4 386.7 483.3 322.2 \n\nLnose [mm] 530.0 176.7 294.4 176.7 220.8 147.2 \n\nLtail [mm] 710.0 236.7 394.4 236.7 295.8 197.2 \n\nLNose/D 2.3 2.2 2.2 2.2 2.2 2.2 \n\nLTail/D 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 \n\nVelocity \u2013 V[m/s] \n\n0.3 0.8 0.5 0.8 0.6 0.9 \n\n0.5 1.5 0.9 1.5 1.2 1.8 \n\n0.8 2.3 1.4 2.3 1.8 2.7 \n\n1.0 3.0 1.8 3.0 2.4 3.6 \n\n1.3 3.8 2.3 3.8 3.0 4.5 \n\n1.5 4.5 2.7 4.5 3.6 5.4 \n\nH*   5.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2022 Experimental Study  Experimental Model Design \n\n 33 \n\nAs shown above, the main difference between TablesTable 4.2 andTable 4.3 lies in the depth \n\nh (400 or 400-D/2). The author selected these dimensions, due to towing tank size (height and \n\nwidth middle point). At this point, h, the influence of both side walls is the same and the author \n\nassumed the same influence on tank\u2019s surface and bottom. In fact, the influence of water\u2019s \n\nsurface and bottom tank wall is not the same, but according to literature review (Froude \n\nnumber, submergence depth and blockage ratio) and to the towing tank restrictions seemed to \n\nbe the most feasible option. Thus, according to the literature review [24], at least H* = 3 must \n\nbe respected for a fully submerged depth. The author preferred to follow the second Table \n\n(Table 4.2), in order to get the largest model. The columns marked as light grey, were the \n\nconditions chosen to follow. In this case, it is relevant to understand that the h = L/2 and h = \n\n5D have the same results. The only difference between each condition is the point where the \n\ncalculation starts i.e. for L/2 the first step is to find the total length and for 5D is to find the \n\nmaximum diameter. Therefore, the largest model and a fully submerged depth were found to \n\nbe respecting all the conditions referred above. A smaller model could be used to do the \n\nexperiments, like for example the h = 6D calculated by the author. However, the smaller the \n\nmodel, the bigger the errors associated with scaling process. Thus, to guarantee Reynold\u2019s \n\nsimilarity, a smaller model needs to achieve a bigger velocity as shown by Equation (2.5). \n\nAs it will be shown in the Experimental Setup, the tank\u2019s depth is not always constant. However, \n\nseveral procedures were made to guarantee the data collection at the location which has the \n\ndesired tank depth (800 mm). \n\nApplying the Equation (2.10) on this study, the blockage ratio is given by the Equation (4.1), \n\n \n(80 . 80)\n\n(800 . 800)\n= 0.01 = ?? (4.1) \n\nThe author uses a blockage ratio of 0.01, for low Froude numbers (always smaller than 0.7) and \n\nsmall wave making as will be shown later. Therefore, the blockage effect has no influence on \n\nresults or it is too small that will be ignored [39]. \n\nIn order to optimize the AUV model, various experimental conditions were defined, after the \n\nrestrictions found due to the towing tank size, with different nose and tail ratios to find the \n\noptimum configuration. Based upon the premise of Figure 3.1 and Table 4.2, all Lengths (Nose, \n\nmid-body and Tail) were calculated. Thus, ratios were discussed and defined to have a logical \n\nmanner of evaluate the body\u2019s model, keeping constant the mid-body\u2019s diameter and length, \n\nvarying only the Nose and Tail lengths. Adapting the full-scale case from Figure 3.1 to the AUV \n\nmodel, due to all restrictions, the hull\u2019s dimensions and ratios were calculated, as can be shown \n\nin Figure 4.1. \n\n\n\nExperimental Model Design  Chapter 4 \u2022 Experimental Study \n\n 34 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 - Characteristics (dimensions, ratios and shapes) of all components of AUV model \n\nused for this study. \n\n4.1.2 Prototype Design &amp; Manufacturing  \n\nIn this section is demonstrated the process of model\u2019s design and crucial considerations adopted \n\nuntil its manufacturing. Besides the design of the AUV model, helpful tools were also designed \n\nto adapt and get easier to the experiments. Thus, this section can be known as the starting \n\npoint for the Experimental Setup that will be described later on this Chapter. \n\n The software used to design this experimental procedure was the CATIA V5R24 powered by \n\nDassault Syst\u00e8mes [59]. CEiiA provided the use of this commercial software. \n\nIt is important to denote that due to several manufacturing limitations, some geometrical \n\nprecautions were taken such as curvature coefficient of nose and tail, and the production of a \n\nperfect conical edge was extremely difficulty to manufacture, leading to a few design \n\nadjustments.  \n\nIn order to optimize the experimental procedure, all connections were screwed to simplify the \n\nprocess, as can be shown in Figure 4.2. In order to connect the AUV to the trolley\u2019s towing tank \n\na detailed study was made. The holes observed on body\u2019s top connect the body to a towing \n\ntank carriage. Figure 4.3 shows an isometric view of the experimental design. \n\n \n\nNose Length (N) Length (L) \n\n352 mm \n \n\nTail Length (T) \n\n \n\nC\no\n\nn\nic\n\n \nE\n\nll\nip\n\nt\nic\n\n \n\nS\nH\n\nA\nP\n\nE\nS\n \n\nL EN G T H  R A T I O S  \n\nT/D: 1.6 \u2013 3.2 \n\n(Tail Length over Diameter ratio) \nN/D: 0.8 \u2013 2.4 \n\n(Nose Length over Diameter ratio) \n\nDiameter (D) \n\n80 mm \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2022 Experimental Study  Experimental Model Design \n\n 35 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 - Left image shows the body without nose and tail.

In this \n\nexperimental case, three AoA were desired to do the experiments, as previously shown.  These \n\nthree AoA are shown in Figure 4.4. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4 - AoA system: left) 0 degrees; middle) 10 degrees; right) 20 degrees. \n\nFigure 4.5 shows a final arrangement of all the components manufactured with respect to \n\nExperimental procedure. However, Figure 4.5 do not include all noses and tails, only a complete \n\nexperimental configuration. As can be shown, a pair of fairings were designed to reduce the \n\nresistance force generated by the struts.  \n\n\n\nExperimental Setup  Chapter 4 \u2022 Experimental Study \n\n 36 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5 - Experimental manufactured components.  \n\nThe associated Images of the final prototype after all the manufacturing processes are \n\npresented in Appendix A. Several different materials were used for this process. All components \n\ninvolving the AUV model (nose, body and tail) and struts were constructed using aluminum 2030 \n\nby machining process (Computer Numeric Control (CNC)). Fairings were developed by an \n\nadditive manufacturing technology called Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) using Polyamide. The \n\nmetallic structure that holds the struts was created by bending process using steel. \n\n4.2 Experimental Setup \n\nOn this section, the author gives the relevant information about every milestone relative to the \n\nExperimental Setup. \n\nThe experiments were conducted in a towing tank at UBI\u2019s Hydraulic Laboratory. Knowing that \n\nrunning the experiments with ocean salt water was not possible, the towing tank was filled \n\nwith fresh water taken from a waterhole by the use of a water pump. The water properties are \n\nshown in Table 4.4. Further, the towing tank dimensions considered are also shown in Table \n\n4.4. The towing tank depth is not constant along the tank, being also 0.5 m depth in some \n\nsections, as shown in Figure 4.6. Nevertheless, the author considered only the section of 0.8 m \n\ndepth for present studies, since the towing carriage needs a section to increase its velocity \n\nuntil reaching the desired velocity, and a section to decrease its velocity until it fully stops. \n\nDue to a few towing tank irregularities it was also observed that this section which the depth \n\nis 0.8 m was the most reliable zone of the towing tank for data collection. Images of the real \n\nexperimental layout are shown in Appendix B.  \n\nTable 4.4 \u2013 Fluid and Towing tank properties. \n\nTemperature 26 [?C]  Length 12 [m] \n\nDensity 996.787 [kg/m3]  Width 0.8 [m] \n\nViscosity 0.00085 [kg/(s.m)]  Depth 0.8 [m] \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2022 Experimental Study  Experimental Setup \n\n 37 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6 - Experimental laboratory layout. \n\nAttending to the conditions imposed, exhibited in Table 4.5, the author encountered a major \n\nproblem to solve, since the towing tank had no system to automatically tow the carriage by a \n\ngiven velocity. Thus, changes should be made to have a system for data collection. To settle \n\nthis issue, the towing tank was adapted after several considerations. The design of full \n\noperational experimental layout is shown in Figure 4.7. \n\nTable 4.5 - Experimental conditions; *Elliptical shape; Elliptic and Conical shapes. \n\nU [m/s] AoA [?] LMid[mm] LNose[mm] * LTail[mm] ** D[mm] \n\n0.50 \u2013 0.75 \u2013 1.00 0 - 10 - 20 352 64 - 128 - 192 128 - 192 - 256 80 \n\n      \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7 - Full experimental design. \n\nThe Load Cell (Dynamometer), showed in Figure 4.7, was used to estimate the total resistance \n\nforce of the towing carriage. It was connected to the carriage and to an iron thread which was \n\npulling the carriage driven by a motor. However, this three-phase motor used was not directly \n\ncontrollable, so a frequency inverter was used to control motor velocity. So, before starting \n\nany Experimental Test, a long construction process was undertaken. Some steps can be \n\nobserved in Appendix C. \n\nThe materials successfully added to the experimental setup are listed below: \n\n- Load cell MAX LOAD 1 ton; \n\n\n\nExperimental Setup  Chapter 4 \u2022 Experimental Study \n\n 38 \n\n- Three-phase motor 0.75 kiloWatt (kW) (1 horsepower (hp)); \n\n- OMRON V1000 50 Hertz (Hz) frequency inverter; \n\n- Pair of polies taken from a Toyota Carina engine; \n\n- Iron thread; \n\n- Toothed belt; \n\n- Aluminum (base is fully made of this material); \n\n- Sheave; \n\n- Solid aluminum rod; \n\n- Iron tube (bobbin); \n\n- Pair of bearings; \n\n- Wood disks; \n\n- Metallic disks; \n\n- Circuit breaker. \n\nTo get the final and desired prototype some processes had to be used, such as: \n\n- Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding; \n\n- Arc welding; \n\n- Grinding machine; \n\n- Mechanically powered saw; \n\n- Turning machine; \n\n- Laser cutting machine; \n\n- Spray painting. \n\nAs any Experimental Procedure, this one was also made by attempts. The author made many \n\ndesign changes, changed several specific materials and tried to solve the problems that \n\nappeared along the way. In Appendix C a few different components from the final product can \n\nbe observed (as different three-phase motor or bobbin), since in a project design there are \n\nalways changes. The Figure 4.8 shows the final prototype ready to be assembled to the towing \n\ntank walls. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2022 Experimental Study  Experimental Setup \n\n 39 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8 - Final metallic structure assembled before mounting at the towing tank. \n\nThe author also made the electric connections between the three-phase motor and the \n\nfrequency inverter. The cable was inserted in the white connector, observed in Figure 4.8, and \n\nthen the three-phase connection on both components were made; the three phases should work \n\nin sequence, otherwise the three-phase motor would not work. The frequency inverter is also \n\nshown in Appendix D. Figure 4.9 showing the point which the Experiments started. Further, a \n\nfew adjustments in the towing tank were also executed, as the use of a caulking gun to fully \n\nclose the gate and rails correction. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.9 - Final Experimental Setup. \n\nTo optimize the Experiments (time and difficulty) an automated returning system, i.e. a system \n\nwhich allowed the towing carriage to go back autonomously to the starting position, was \n\ndeveloped. A Figure of this \u201creturning system\u201d is shown in Appendix C. This system simplified \n\nthe Experimental Procedure, since without it a run would take three times longer than it did.  \n\n\n\nExperimental Setup  Chapter 4 \u2022 Experimental Study \n\n 40 \n\nThere are also several considerations made by the author during the Experiments. Each of this \n\nExperiments consists of: a stationary phase (initial position); an accelerating phase until \n\nreaching the desired velocity and then remains constant for data collection; and a decelerating \n\nphase until the carriage stops in a safety mode (final position). In fact, data collection was \n\nmade along the entire run and only after data analyzing the desired range was selected. \n\nAlthough, these Experiments depend on various factors during each data collection \n\n(instruments, stationary water, initial and final position, dynamometer precision and others), \n\ni.e. there is an uncertainty value associated in the resistance force during each data collection. \n\nTherefore, the ITTC [60] described the importance of repeat measurements at least 10 times \n\nfor each specific combinations as a better measure of uncertainty. Based on this, the author \n\ndefined that 10 samples should be measured for each combination. \n\n4.2.1 Data Collection \n\nA load cell was used to measure the resistance force. This load cell, with a maximum load of 1 \n\nton, is a force transducer for the measurement of static and dynamic loads in compression and \n\ntension. This equipment, was manufactured by AEP transducers and provided by CEiiA. For data \n\ncollection a WIMOD transmitter and WISTAR receiver were used. The WIMOD transmitter, \n\napplied on the body of the load cell, through a wireless communication integrated interface \n\nwith WISTAR receiver, shown in Appendix D. This receiver had a DATALOGGER option which \n\nallows to memorize measurements and to keep them in the internal memory. WIMOD can also \n\ncommunicate directly in real time to a Personal Computer (PC) which uses a software for instant \n\ndata collection. However, this faster process was unavailable. So, for data collection the \n\nDATALOGGER option was used. The WISTAR was configured accordingly the needs (recording \n\ntime, transmission frequency, bound rate and time between each communication). Further, \n\nsince the calibration of these instruments is done periodically, the author only set zero at the \n\ndesired position (initial position). This equipment had an improved uncertainty from 0.005% to \n\n0.02% [61].  \n\n4.2.2 Weight difference \n\nA study of weight difference between all combinations was made before the Experimental \n\nTests. After some testing runs, it was revealed that this study was also important and had \n\ninfluence on the results due to the friction force between the wheels and the rails, which \n\ndepends on the weight of the towing carriage (trolley, assembly and model test). This study \n\nconsisted in: measuring the Volume (V) of all the body\u2019s components precisely using CATIA \n\nV5R24 software; use the Archimedes\u2019 Principle (\u201cindicates that the upward buoyancy force that \n\nis exerted on a body immersed in a fluid, whether fully or partially submerged, is equal to the \n\nweight of the fluid that the body displaces\u201d [62]) to calculate the Buoyancy (B) of each \n\ncomponent (shown in Table 4.6 &amp; Table 4.7) and define the heaviest combination as standard \n\n(Table 4.8); calculate the difference between the standard (heaviest) combination and each \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2022 Experimental Study  Experimental Setup \n\n 41 \n\nother; and get an approximation of weight necessary to be added for each combination (Table \n\n4.9).    \n\nTable 4.6 - Nose characteristics with buoyancy. \n\nNose L [mm] m [g] V [mm3] B [g] Wetted mass [g] \n\nE1 64 633.0 222068.7 222.1 411.0 \n\nE2 128 1244.0 436534.8 436.5 808.0 \n\nE3 192 1855.0 651000.8 651.0 1204.0 \n\n      \n\nTable 4.7 - Tail characteristics with buoyancy. \n\nTail L [mm] m [g] V [mm3] B [g] Wetted mass [g] \n\nE1 128 1244.0 436534.8 436.5 808.0 \n\nE2 192 1855.0 651000.8 651.0 1204.0 \n\nE3 256 2467.0 865466.9 865.5 1601.0 \n\nC1 128 820.0 287766.1 287.8 532.0 \n\nC2 192 1283.0 450256.0 450.3 833.0 \n\nC3 256 1775.0 622878.0 622.9 1152.0 \n\n      \n\nTable 4.8 - Mass Combinations. \n\nCombination 1  Combination 7  Combination 13 \n\nE1 + E1 (g) 1218  E2 + E1 (g) 1615  E3 + E1 (g) 2012 \n\n        \n\nCombination 2  Combination 8  Combination 14 \n\nE1 + E2 (g) 1615  E2 + E2 (g) 2012  E3 + E2 (g) 2409 \n\n        \n\nCombination 3  Combination 9  Combination 15 \n\nE1 + E3 (g) 2012  E2 + E3 (g) 2409  E3 + E3 (g) 2805 \n\n        \n\nCombination 4  Combination 10  Combination 16 \n\nE1 + C1 (g) 943  E2 + C1 (g) 1340  E3 + C1 (g) 1737 \n\n        \n\nCombination 5  Combination 11  Combination 17 \n\nE1 + C2 (g) 1244  E2 + C2 (g) 1641  E3 + C2 (g) 2037 \n\n        \n\nCombination 6  Combination 12  Combination 18 \n\nE1 + C3 (g) 1563  E2 + C3 (g) 1960  E3 + C3 (g) 2357 \n\n        \n\n  \n\n\n\nExperimental Setup  Chapter 4 \u2022 Experimental Study \n\n 42 \n\nTable 4.9 - Combinations weight with its adding load values. \n\nSame combinations Comb.

Thus, the author \n\norganized the combinations into Groups. Since it was not possible to add the exact value of \n\nload, the author also made an estimation about the error using an approximation of adding \n\nload. The maximum value for this error is 2.4% (Table 4.9), which has negligible influence. \n\nImages of this consideration are shown in Appendix E. \n\n4.2.3 Drag Calculation \n\nAs shown before, the model was connected to the metallic structure (attached to the towing \n\ntank) through two struts covered by fairings. However, the load cell was connected to the \n\ntowing carriage, measuring the total resistance force of all sets. In order to measure only the \n\nAUV\u2019s resistance force, the method adopted was the same of Mansoorzadeh and Javanmard  \n\n[52] adopted for their experiment. The method is to measure only the resistance force of towing \n\ncarriage with the metallic structure and struts attached. Then, measure the resistance force \n\nof all components (towing carriage, metallic structure, struts and AUV model). Finally, \n\nsubtracting these two processes, the AUV\u2019s resistance force could be calculated. The method \n\nimplemented for Drag estimation is shown in Figure 4.10. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2022 Experimental Study  Experimental Setup \n\n 43 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.10 \u2013 Procedure adopted to calculate the Drag caused, exclusively, by the hull body. \n\n4.2.4 Frequency inverter study / Velocity estimation \n\nOn this section, considerations to estimate the AUV\u2019s velocity will be detailed. As will be shown \n\nhere, the velocity is directly linked with the frequency inverter, i.e. the frequency inverter \n\ncontrols the three-phase motor frequency.  \n\nAs described previously, the frequency inverter can operate up to 50 Hz. The methodology \n\nadopted to find the velocity in which the AUV model was travelling was: Define a known \n\ndistance to measure the time which AUV model takes to run; save that time and frequency; \n\nusing the Equation (4.2) calculate the velocity; and repeat this process until discover the \n\nmaximum velocity desired. \n\n ? =  \n?\n\n?\n (4.2) \n\nWhere ? is the velocity, ? the distance traveled in meters (m) and ? the time in seconds (?). \n\nThe Table 4.10 demonstrates all these considerations above referred. \n\n  \n\n\n\nExperimental Setup  Chapter 4 \u2022 Experimental Study \n\n 44 \n\nTable 4.10 \u2013 Corresponding Velocity for each Frequency.

However, due \n\nto some technical issues, it was not possible to run all combinations. Thus, at least eleven from \n\neighteen combinations were performed (around 1100 test). In order to achieve the optimum \n\nconfiguration and its conditions, several studies were done and will be shown below. The author \n\nopted to look for a trend between the results, since there are a considerable number of them. \n\nThese results are structured in a coherent manner: find the optimum configuration for each \n\ntail shape, compare them between each other, and finally demonstrate a detailed study of the \n\noptimum configuration. Should be noted that by the lack of some results, including results for \n\nthe biggest nose (N/D = 2.4), it was not possible to display results for this ratio. \n\n4.3.1 Length Optimization (Conical Tail) \n\nFor this Conical Tail study, two steps were considered in order to find the effect of AoA and \n\nVelocity, on Drag. These steps include the nominal AoA and velocity for this AUV model. The \n\nfirst step is: by fixing the AoA at 0 degrees, finding the optimum nose and tail configuration. \n\nConsecutively, the second one is: by fixing the velocity at 1 m/s, finding the optimum nose and \n\ntail configuration. \n\nInfluence of Nose length on Drag for nominal AoA (0 degrees) \n\nFixing the AoA at 0 degrees and T/D at 3.2, varying the N/D within a range of 0.8 to 1.6, Drag \n\nResults are shown in Chart 4.1: \n\n\n\nExperimental Tests Results  Chapter 4 \u2022 Experimental Study \n\n 46 \n\n \n\nChart 4.1 \u2013 Drag Results for different velocities operating at 0 degrees, varying N/D between \n\n0.8 to 1.6, and fixing the T/D = 3.2. \n\nThe Chart 4.1 demonstrates a trend of all velocities for the optimum N/D ratio at 0.8. It can \n\nbe noted that Drag increases linearly with the increase of N/D ratios. Also, Drag increases \n\nwhenever the velocity increase. There is a Drag difference between 0.75 and 1.00 m/s that is \n\nnearly the double compared with 0.50 and 0.75 m/s. \n\nInfluence of Tail length on Drag for nominal AoA (0 degrees) \n\nFixing the AoA at 0 degrees and N/D at 0.8, varying the T/D within a range of 1.6 to 3.2, the \n\nDrag results are shown in Chart 4.2: \n\n \n\nChart 4.2 - Drag Results for different velocities operating at 0 degrees, fixing N/D and varying \n\nT/D between 1.6 to 3.2. \n\n0,50\n\n0,55\n\n0,60\n\n0,65\n\n0,70\n\n0,75\n\n0,80\n\n0,85\n\n0,90\n\n0,8 0,9 1,0 1,1 1,2 1,3 1,4 1,5 1,6\n\nD\nra\n\ng\n [\n\nN\n]\n\nN/D\n\nN/D vary _ T/D = 3.2 (0 degrees)\n\n1 m/s\n\n0.75 m/s\n\n0.5 m/s\n\n0,40\n\n0,45\n\n0,50\n\n0,55\n\n0,60\n\n0,65\n\n0,70\n\n0,75\n\n0,80\n\n1,6 1,8 2,0 2,2 2,4 2,6 2,8 3,0 3,2\n\nD\nra\n\ng\n [\n\nN\n]\n\nT/D\n\nN/D = 0.8 _ T/D vary (0 degrees)\n\n1 m/s\n\n0.75 m/s\n\n0.5 m/s\n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2022 Experimental Study  Experimental Tests Results \n\n 47 \n\nThe Chart 4.2 presents an optimum T/D ratio at 1.6. For T/D = 1.6, the Drag difference between \n\neach velocity it is nearly close until T/D = 2.4. This Chart also denote higher Drag for higher \n\nvelocities. Furthermore, Drag increases non-linear with T/D ratios.  \n\nInfluence of Nose length on Drag for nominal velocity (1 m/s) \n\nFixing the velocity at 1 m/s and T/D at 3.2, varying the N/D within a range of 0.8 to 1.6, the \n\nDrag results are shown in Chart 4.3: \n\n \n\nChart 4.3 - Drag Results for different AoA\u2019s operating at 1 m/s, varying N/D between 0.8 to \n\n1.6, and fixing the T/D = 3.2. \n\nThe Chart 4.3 shows that Drag increases with the increase of N/D ratio at 0 and 10 degrees, \n\nand between both. Further, for these AoA\u2019s the optimum N/D ratio is 0.8. However, for an AoA \n\nof 20 degrees, the Drag decreases by increasing the N/D ratio. The optimum N/D ratio for this \n\nAoA is 1.6. This occurrence can be justified with the experimental error associated with high \n\nvelocities, AoA\u2019s and for bigger lengths (high N/D ratio, in this case). AUV model operating \n\nunder these conditions might bring into consideration the Wall and Surface effects, albeit \n\ndimensions are being respected according literature review [24]. Globally, the optimum N/D \n\nratio can be considered 0.8 (operating under nominal velocity the AUV should operate with low \n\nAoA\u2019s). At this N/D ratio, the Drag value almost double up between 0 and 20 degrees. \n\nInfluence of Tail length on Drag for nominal velocity (1 m/s) \n\nFixing the velocity at 1 m/s and N/D at 0.8, varying the T/D within a range of 1.6 to 3.2, the \n\nDrag results are shown in Chart 4.4: \n\n0,40\n\n0,60\n\n0,80\n\n1,00\n\n1,20\n\n1,40\n\n1,60\n\n0,8 1,0 1,2 1,4 1,6\n\nd\nra\n\ng\n [\n\nN\n]\n\nN/D\n\nN/D vary _ T/D = 3.2 (1 m/s)\n\n20 deg\n\n10 deg\n\n0 deg\n\n\n\nExperimental Tests Results  Chapter 4 \u2022 Experimental Study \n\n 48 \n\n \n\nChart 4.4 - Drag Results for different AoA\u2019s operating at 1 m/s, fixing N/D and varying the \n\nT/D between 1.6 to 3.2. \n\nThe Chart 4.4 indicates an optimum T/D ratio of 1.6. At this T/D ratio, the Drag value almost \n\ndouble up between 0 and 20 degrees. For lower AoA\u2019s the Drag almost remains constant for \n\ndifferent T/D ratio. However, for an AoA of 20 degrees Drag has a considerable increase with \n\nthe increase of T/D ratio.  \n\n4.3.2 Length Optimization (Elliptical Tail) \n\nFollowing the same procedure applied for Conical Tail, a parallel Elliptical Tail study was made \n\nfind the effect of AoA and Velocity on Drag, to finally compare both shapes later. \n\nInfluence of Nose length on Drag for nominal AoA (0 degrees) \n\nFixing the AoA at 0 degrees and T/D at 3.2, varying the N/D within a range of 0.8 to 2.4, the \n\nDrag results are shown in Chart 4.5: \n\n0,40\n\n0,60\n\n0,80\n\n1,00\n\n1,20\n\n1,40\n\n1,60\n\n1,6 1,8 2,0 2,2 2,4 2,6 2,8 3,0 3,2\n\nD\nra\n\ng\n [\n\nN\n]\n\nT/D\n\nN/D = 0.8 _ T/D vary (1 m/s)\n\n20 deg\n\n10 deg\n\n0 deg\n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2022 Experimental Study  Experimental Tests Results \n\n 49 \n\n \n\nChart 4.5 - Drag Results for different velocities operating at 0 degrees, varying N/D between \n\n0.8 to 2.4, and fixing the T/D = 3.2. \n\nThe Chart 4.5 presents an optimum N/D ratio of 0.8.

Furthermore, for these \n\nAoA\u2019s the optimum N/D ratio is 0.8. However, for an AoA of 20 degrees, the Drag decreases by \n\nincreasing the N/D ratio until N/D = 1.6, which is the optimum N/D ratio for this AoA, and \n\nincreases hereafter. This behavior can be justified with the experimental error associated with \n\nhigh velocities, AoA\u2019s and for bigger lengths. AUV model operating under these conditions might \n\nbring into consideration the Wall and Surface effects, as referred previously. Globally, the \n\noptimum N/D ratio can be considered 0.8 (operating under nominal velocity the AUV should \n\noperate with low AoA\u2019s). At this N/D ratio, the Drag value almost double up between 0 and 20 \n\ndegrees of AoA. \n\nInfluence of Tail length for nominal velocity (1 m/s) \n\nFixing the velocity at 1 m/s and N/D at 0.8, varying the T/D within a range of 1.6 to 3.2, the \n\nDrag results are shown in Chart 4.8: \n\n0,40\n\n0,60\n\n0,80\n\n1,00\n\n1,20\n\n1,40\n\n1,60\n\n1,80\n\n0,8 1,0 1,2 1,4 1,6 1,8 2,0 2,2 2,4\n\nD\nra\n\ng\n [\n\nN\n]\n\nN/D\n\nN/D vary _ T/D = 3.2 (1 m/s)\n\n20 deg\n\n10 deg\n\n0 deg\n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2022 Experimental Study  Experimental Tests Results \n\n 51 \n\n \n\nChart 4.8 - Drag Results for different AoA\u2019s operating at 1 m/s, fixing N/D and varying T/D \n\nbetween 1.6 to 3.2 \n\nThe Chart 4.8 shows an optimum T/D ratio at 1.6. At nominal AoA (0 degrees), Drag increases \n\nlinearly with the increase of T/D ratio. For bigger AoA\u2019s, Drag increases with the increase of \n\nT/D until 2.4. Hereinafter, Drag has the trend to remain constant. \n\n4.3.3 Tendencies \n\nAnalyzing the Charts presented above, there is clearly a common trend between both cases \n\n(Elliptical and Conical). However, it is not clear which of these cases is the optimum. Some \n\nconclusions should be made in order to compare them afterwards. \n\nFor 0 degrees, a N/D ratio of 0.8 was the optimum value for both Conical and Elliptical tails. \n\nFurther, Drag\u2019s behavior in these cases, is almost the same (increases with regard to Velocity \n\nand AoA). \n\nFor 0 degrees, a T/D ratio of 1.6 is clearly the optimum value for both tail shapes. Drag also \n\nincrease with the increase of T/D ratios and Velocity. \n\nRelatively to the nominal velocity (1 m/s), both Charts (Chart 4.3 and Chart 4.7) (Elliptical and \n\nConical, respectively) describe the same behavior until N/D = 1.6, showing that there is a trend \n\nbetween both combinations, being interesting to note the similar behavior of these Charts. N/D \n\nratio of 0.8 seem to be the optimum value for both cases, although for an AoA of 20 degrees \n\nthe optimum value is N/D = 1.6. Drag for N/D ratio of 0.8 almost doubles up for both cases, \n\nsince 0 degrees to 20 degrees of AoA. \n\n0,40\n\n0,60\n\n0,80\n\n1,00\n\n1,20\n\n1,40\n\n1,60\n\n1,6 1,8 2,0 2,2 2,4 2,6 2,8 3,0 3,2\n\nD\nra\n\ng\n [\n\nN\n]\n\nT/D\n\nN/D = 0.8 _ T/D vary (1 m/s)\n\n20 deg\n\n10 deg\n\n0 deg\n\n\n\nExperimental Tests Results  Chapter 4 \u2022 Experimental Study \n\n 52 \n\nFinally, at the velocity of 1 m/s, the optimum T/D ratio is 1.6 for Elliptical and Conical (Chart \n\n4.4 and Chart 4.8, respectively) tails. In these cases, Drag has a similar behavior for 0 and 10 \n\ndegrees of AoA. Furthermore, for 20 degrees of AoA, the behavior is also similar until T/D ratio \n\nof 2.4. \n\n4.3.4 Comparison between optimum configurations \n\nAfter careful analysis, it has been concluded that for both cases the optimum configuration is \n\nN/D = 0.8 (elliptical nose) and T/D = 1.6 (elliptical and conical tail). Following the study, the \n\noptimum configuration between both cases should be found. The Chart 4.9 and Chart 4.10 \n\ncompare both cases, Conical and Elliptical to find the tail shape that produces lower Drag by \n\nvarying AoA and Velocity, respectively. \n\n \n\nChart 4.9 - Comparison of Drag Results between Conical and Elliptical tail shapes, for \n\ndifferent AoA\u2019s on a velocity of 1 m/s. FALTA LEGENDAR CORRECTAMENTE \n\nThe Chart 4.9 shows the comparison between an Elliptical and Conical Tail shapes operating \n\nunder the same conditions, i.e. operating at 1 m/s for different AoA\u2019s (0-20?). Although tail \n\nshapes demonstrate a similar result, the Conical tail shape shows to be the geometry that \n\nproduce lower Drag. \n\n0,40\n\n0,60\n\n0,80\n\n1,00\n\n1,20\n\n1,40\n\n1,60\n\n1,6 2,1 2,6 3,1\n\nD\nra\n\ng\n [\n\nN\n]\n\nT/D\n\nDrag vs. T/D ratio (1 m/s)\n\n20 deg\n\n20 deg\n\n10 deg\n\n10 deg\n\n0 deg\n\n0 deg\n\nEllip.\nCon.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 \u2022 Experimental Study  Experimental Tests Results \n\n 53 \n\n \n\nChart 4.10 - Comparison between Elliptical and Conical tail shapes, for different velocities at \n\n0 degrees of AoA. \n\nThe Chart 4.10 demonstrates the comparison between Elliptical and Conical tail shapes \n\noperating at different velocities on a fixed AoA (0 degrees). There are also similar results for \n\nboth cases, but for nominal velocity (1 m/s) it is evident that Conical Tail shape shows to be \n\nthe final optimum configuration. Therefore, based on these two comparisons showed, the \n\nauthor will focus on the optimum geometry for a more detailed study. \n\n4.3.5 Optimum Experimental Combination \n\nAs described previously, a combination of an Elliptical nose with a N/D = 0.8 and a Conical tail \n\nwith a T/D = 1.6 showed to be the optimum configuration. Thus, it will be showed Drag force \n\nand Coefficient variation with Velocity and AoA. The two following Charts (Chart 4.11 &amp; Chart \n\n4.12) exhibit a study of Drag force and Coefficient, respectively, for the optimum combination. \n\n0,40\n\n0,45\n\n0,50\n\n0,55\n\n0,60\n\n0,65\n\n0,70\n\n0,75\n\n0,80\n\n1,6 1,8 2,0 2,2 2,4 2,6 2,8 3,0 3,2\n\nD\nra\n\ng\n [\n\nN\n]\n\nT/D\n\nDrag vs. T/D (0 degrees)\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0,75\n\n0,75\n\n0,5\n\n0,5\n\nEllip.\nCon.\n\n\n\nExperimental Tests Results  Chapter 4 \u2022 Experimental Study \n\n 54 \n\n \n\nChart 4.11 - The influence of AoA\u2019s (0 - 20?) on Drag, for different velocities (0.5 - 1.00 m/s). \n\n \n\nChart 4.12 - The influence of Velocity (0.5 \u2013 1.00 m/s) on Drag, for different AoA\u2019s (0 - 20?). \n\nAnalyzing these two Charts (Chart 4.11 &amp; Chart 4.12) represented above, it can be concluded \n\nthat the Drag increases with Velocity and AoA. Relatively to nominal conditions (1 m/s and 0 \n\ndegrees), it can be also concluded that Drag is always minimum when operating at 0 degrees \n\nfor all velocities. However, operating at 1 m/s, Drag is higher comparatively to lower velocities. \n\nThere is an operating point that should be avoided, in which Drag reaches its maximum. This \n\npoint is: Velocity = 1 m/s and AoA = 20?. Drag Coefficient increases with the increasing of AoA, \n\nand decreases with the increasing of velocity.

This procedure embraces the Model\u2019s \n\ndimensions intended to be studied initially, i.e. the hull\u2019s dimensions applied for Numerical \n\nSimulation are shown in Figure 3.1. The CFD software ANSYS FLUENT 16.0 was used for this \n\nthesis to predict the hydrodynamic coefficients and forces. Thus, Numerical Results and \n\nconclusions about Numerical Procedure will be also provided. \n\n5.1 Numerical Setup (Procedure) \n\nThis procedure comprises the use of ANSYS WorkBench (WB) 16.1, ANSYS Meshing 16.1 and \n\nANSYS FLUENT 16.1 that were used on this thesis. A Fluid Flow (FLUENT) template was chosen \n\nto start this procedure (default Analysis System), which includes a sequence of steps as: \n\nGeometry, Mesh, Setup, Solution and Results. \n\n5.1.1 Model Design and Flow Domain \n\nFollowing the sequence referred above, the Geometry was designed using the CATIA V5R24. \n\nThe Geometry was imported to the WB in a file format Computer-Aided Design (CAD). To define \n\nthe Flow Domain, a Control Volume (CV) was also created. There are no exact guideline values \n\nregarding the dimensions of this CV, although several authors [11], [52], [57], [63] refer that \n\nthe solution domain needs to be large enough to capture the entire wake development. \n\nTherefore, the CV dimensions were chosen to ensure that all interactions and wake \n\ndevelopments were captured. The Figure 5.1 shows the Fluid Domain dimensions used for this \n\nNumerical Simulation. \n\n\n\nNumerical Setup (Procedure)  Chapter 5 \u2022 Numerical Analysis \n\n 56 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1 - Control Volume dimensions. \n\nThe hull dimensions (Diameter of 340 mm and mid-body length of 1500 mm) used to function \n\ncomparatively as base for CV dimensions. However, in this case it was not applied, since the \n\nliterature review varies too much to define a precise value which guarantees that the flow is \n\nnot affected due to small dimensions of CV [11], [52], [57], [63]. \n\nThe front of the CV is semi-circular, as demonstrated in Figure 5.1. Due to a more complex \n\ncalculus (higher computational cost) with relative velocity passing by the corners when \n\noperating at high AoA, this configuration was adopted to simplify the process, improve mesh \n\nquality and help with results convergence. \n\nSince the CV is only relative to the flow field, the hull body was removed from the CV, to apply \n\nall fluid parameters/conditions in the CV, i.e. the CV must be occupied only with fluid, the \n\nbody\u2019s volume must be extracted.  \n\n5.1.2 Meshing Process  \n\nAfter defining the Fluid Domain, the division of the flow into small elements must be done. The \n\nsoftware ANSYS Meshing was used to do this decomposition. During the Meshing Process, there \n\nare several important parameters which influence the Numerical Simulation Results, as domain \n\nsize, mesh size and distance of the first layer of the cells to the hull (?), controlled by the \n\nInflation Layer. This distance introduces to ?+ parameter. ?+ is the dimensionless number from \n\nthe body\u2019s surface to the near wall node and it is given by the Equation (5.1), \n\n ?+  =  \n?. ??\n\n?\n (5.1) \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2022 Numerical Analysis  Numerical Setup (Procedure) \n\n 57 \n\nWhere ? is the distance of the first layer of the cells to the hull, ?? the friction velocity and ? \n\nthe local kinematic viscosity of the fluid. \n\nThe friction velocity (??) can be expressed as (Equation (5.2)), \n\n ?? =  ?\n??\n?\n\n (5.2) \n\nWhere ?? is the shear stress and ? the density. \n\nTurbulent flows are considerably affected by the presence of walls. So, an accurate \n\nrepresentation of the flow in the near-wall region gives a better prediction of wall-bounded \n\nturbulent flows. Thereby, depending on each Turbulence Model and Near-Wall Treatment, \n\nthere is a range of optimum values for ?+ where the reliability of numerical solutions is \n\nimproved, i.e. controlling the Inflation Layer, the ? + can be adjusted into this range. For ?-? \n\nturbulence model, the calculation of the boundary layer is substituted by a wall function \n\nreducing this way the computational requirements. Nevertheless, the use of these wall \n\nfunctions can only be performed if the value of ?+ is between 30 and 300.[42].  \n\nIn order to optimize the Meshing Results as much as possible, several parameters were tested \n\nto understand how their influence on results. The input parameters tested are shown in Table \n\n5.1. Thus, the output parameters as Cell number ?+ are also shown in Table 5.1. Several other \n\nMeshing tests were made, however only the most relevant are shown below. \n\n\n\nNumerical Setup (Procedure)  Chapter 5 \u2022 Numerical Analysis \n\n 58 \n\nTable 5.1 - Several Meshing parameters tested. \n\nAuv faces \n\nElement size 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.007 0.007 0.006 0.005 0.004 0.003 \n\nCurv normal angle 10 10 10 5 10 5 5 10 10 10 \n\nGrowth rate 1.15 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.1 \n\nmin size 0.0005 0.0004 0.0003 0.0002 0.0004 0.0002 0.0003 0.0003 0.0002 0.0002 \n\nwake Element size 0.1 0.1 0.06 0.06 0.06 0.06 0.06 0.06 0.05 0.04 \n\nMesh Growth rate 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.15 1.15 1.15 1.15 \n\nInflation \nlayer \n\nFirst cell height 0.003 0.002 0.0015 0.0015 0.002 0.0015 0.002 0.002 0.0015 0.0015 \n\nNumber of layers 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 \n\nGrowth rate 1.2 1.15 1.15 1.15 1.15 1.15 1.15 1.15 1.15 1.15 \n\nOutput \nparameters \n\nCell No (tetra) 1796895 2311103 2464303 1817579 4023766 3990712 4911547 6620161 9629189 15785430 \n\nCell No (poly) 419260 504798 530643 370622 905507 900812 1136846 1568379 2309891 3864672 \n\nY+ (min)            \n\nY+(85% cells ) 40-80 34-55 25-35 25-35 25-36  35-45  28-36 25-40 \n\nY+ average (85% \ncells ) \n\n60 40 30 30 30  40  31 28 \n\nY+ (max) 80 53 40 40 40   55   42 42 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2022 Numerical Analysis  Numerical Setup (Procedure) \n\n 59 \n\nApplied exclusively on Hull faces, the input parameters modified during several attempts were: \n\nElement size, Curvature Normal Angle, Growth Rate and Minimum size of an element. \n\nThe Element size specifies the element size used for the specific selection, in this case, to Hull \n\nfaces. The Curvature Normal Angle is the maximum angle that one element edge is allowed to \n\nspan. Growth Rate represents the increase between succeeding layer elements. The Minimum \n\nsize of an element represents the minimum size that is allowed to elements for the specific \n\nselection [64].   \n\nThe Wake section is a volume created to add a specific refinement at the desired location. This \n\nWake is represented in Figure 5.2. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2 - Shape of the Wake for an improved Mesh treatment. \n\nAs can be seen in Figure 5.2, the Wake\u2019s shape was chosen to improve the mesh refinement on \n\na specific location where the Wake development is crucial. The Element size was adjusted to \n\nunderstand how important was the mesh treatment on that location. \n\nThe Mesh section refers to the Mesh in general. Elements not selected for a specific treatment, \n\nwill follow the condition imposed by Mesh section. It is important to defined the Maximum \n\nElement Size in a far field and its Growth Rate, as shown in Table 5.1. \n\nThe Inflation Layer, that includes the parameters First cell height, Number of layers and Growth \n\nRate, represents the Boundary Layer. This is a crucial section to the Meshing Process. The \n\nboundary layer height should be predicted by empirical methods and then similar represented \n\nat Inflation Layer. Details about Boundary Layer can be seen in reference [32]. \n\n\n\nNumerical Setup (Procedure)  Chapter 5 \u2022 Numerical Analysis \n\n 60 \n\nThe Meshing Results are shown in Figure 5.3. The Mesh domain was converted from Tetrahedral \n\nMesh to Polyhedral Mesh, since Polyhedral Mesh requires a smaller computational cost and keep \n\nshowing good Results by improving the Mesh quality. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3 - Left) Mesh Result; Right) Detailed Nose Mesh Result. \n\nFigure 5.3 presents the Mesh Result with a refinement on Body Wake (Figure 5.3 - Left). This \n\nResult had nearly 1 million Polyhedral cells, and the range of ?+ was between 35 and 45 (Table \n\n5.1, grey column). Furthermore, the Inflation Layer can be also seen (Figure 5.3 - Right) with \n\nan improved refinement with comparison to the entire Mesh. Knowing that the ?+ for Standard \n\n?-? Turbulence Model (used on Figure 5.3) should be close but above 30 and bellow 300, these \n\nvalues are quite acceptable. \n\n5.1.3 Physical Model Setup and Simulation \n\nFluid properties \n\nThe liquid water was chosen as fluid. The fluid properties are shown in Table 5.2. \n\nTable 5.2 - Fluid properties. \n\nDensity 1027 [kg/m3] \n\nViscosity 0.00167 [kg/(s.m)] \n\n \n\nBoundary Conditions \n\nTo define several parameters at Fluid Domain, the boundary conditions were specified. The \n\nSidewalls of the CV, corresponding to far-field flow, were defined as symmetry plane to highly \n\nreduce the CPU cost on those boundaries. The hull body was defined with a Stationary wall \n\ncondition (no-slip condition). The velocity inlet boundary condition was applied at the Inlet. \n\nPressure-outlet boundary condition was applied at outlet. \n\nThe flow velocities were set and changed at velocity inlet boundary condition. The flow \n\ndirection was decomposed when a specific AoA was desired. Thus, turbulence quantities were \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2022 Numerical Analysis  Numerical Validation \n\n 61 \n\nalso set. Since the simulations were compared with experimental towing tank tests, the \n\nturbulence intensity was set to be 0.05% and the turbulence length was equal to 7% of the hull \n\nbody length (Dantas &amp; Barros, 2013). \n\nThe convergence criteria adopted for this Numerical Simulation was 10-5 in residuals. \n\nTwo Turbulence Models were chosen for the Numerical Simulations: Standard ?-? and ?-? SST \n\nmodels. A mesh-independent study was also made to evaluate which Turbulence Model was \n\nchosen, following a mesh-quality/computational cost trade-off. The Chart 5.1 demonstrates \n\nthis study. Two empirical methods were also implemented to compare against the Turbulence \n\nModels. These empirical methods were G&amp;J and VT methods applied by Alam et al. [36] on their \n\nstudy. \n\n \n\nChart 5.1 - Mesh-independency study (referent to Table 5.1). \n\nAs can be seen in Chart 5.1, the Standard ?-? Turbulence Model requires a lower computational \n\ncost when compared to the ?-? SST Model to stabilize, i.e. Standard ?-? Turbulence Model \n\nbetter predicts Drag value for lower computational cost, while the Drag value do not stabilize \n\nfor ?-? SST Model, not even using higher computational cost. Consequently, the Standard ?-? \n\nwas the Turbulence Model adopted. \n\n5.2 Numerical Validation  \n\nIn order to validate the Numerical Simulations against the Experimental Tests, a pertinent \n\nprocedure was adopted. Following the Experimental Test Results used in Chapter 4, the \n\ncomparison Numerical/Experimental was made. Therefore, the N/D ratio was fixed at 0.8 \n\n(optimum Experimental Nose length) and the T/D ratio varied between 1.6 and 3.2, for each \n\nspecific Tail shape (Elliptical and Conical) and then comparing the Experimental Tests with \n\nNumerical Simulations. However, due to the scale difference between each Procedure \n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nD\nra\n\ng\n (\n\nN\n)\n\nNumber of cells Milh\u00f5es\n\nk-?, std\n\nGJ\n\nMIT\n\nk-?

However, it was not possible to apply the Equations (2.7) and (2.8), since these \n\nEquations assume the same fluid properties in both cases. Therefore, Table 5.3 shows the \n\nReynold\u2019s similarity done, considering different flow properties.  \n\nTable 5.3 \u2013 Reynold\u2019s Similarity applied. \n\n  Experimental Model Full-scale Prototype Re %Approx. \n\nDensity (?)

To achieve similar flow \n\nconditions for the experimental model travelling at 1 m/s, the full-scale prototype should be \n\ntested for a velocity of 0.45 m/s (see Table 5.3).  The Reynold\u2019s number it is not the same for \n\nboth cases, but as demonstrated the Error is so small (0.3%), that it is assumed equal Reynold\u2019s \n\nnumbers to achieve a desired operational velocity of the full-scale prototype. \n\nConsequently, the Chart 5.2 &amp; Chart 5.3 demonstrates this study for an Elliptical and Conical \n\nTail shapes, respectively. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2022 Numerical Analysis  Numerical Validation \n\n 63 \n\n \n\nChart 5.2 - Comparison of CD Results between Numerical and Experimental Procedure varying \n\nT/D ratio between 1.6 to 3.2 for an Elliptical Tail shape case. \n\n \n\nChart 5.3 - Comparison of CD Results between Numerical and Experimental Procedure varying \n\nT/D ratio between 1.6 to 3.2 for a Conical Tail shape case. \n\nAs can be seen in Chart 5.2 &amp; Chart 5.3, Drag\u2019s behavior between them is similar.

Since there are several errors associated with this \n\nComparison (Error scale effect, Reynold\u2019s number similarity, Towing tank conditions, Load cell \n\nprecision, Numerical predictions and even water\u2019s temperature) these results indicate a good \n\nagreement. \n\nThe Chart 5.2 &amp; Chart 5.3 also concludes that the Conical Tail produces a lower Drag for \n\nExperimental and Numerical Results. This phenomenon can be understood by visually analyzing \n\nthe Figure 5.4. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2022 Numerical Analysis  Numerical Validation \n\n 65 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4 - Velocity contours/vectors for different Tail configurations at nominal velocity \n\n(full-scale prototype) of 0.45 m/s. \n\nThe Figure 5.4 shows different Tail configurations operating at 0? of AoA and nominal velocity \n\nof 0.45 m/s for full-scale prototype, and their associated velocity phenomena. Thus, by \n\nanalyzing the Figure 5.4 and following the energy conservation principle, it can be seen that \n\nthe Conical Tail produce a lower Drag when compared with the other geometries. The first line \n\nof Figure 5.4, shows a hull body without nose and tail, where the velocity achieves its lowest \n\npoint at Nose or Bow, since there is no Nose in this case. This point is known as Stagnation Point \n\n(following the energy conservation principle, this point is also the highest point of pressure). \n\nAt Tail or Stern, there are several Eddies created (Large and Small Scale). These Eddies, \n\ncontribute greatly to the increase of Drag, becoming smaller with an Elliptical Tail (Figure 5.4 \n\n- second line) and almost disappearing with Conical Tail (Figure 5.4 \u2013 third line). Therefore, \n\nFigure 5.4 also validates the Conical Tail as being the configuration that produces the lowest \n\nDrag (according to the geometries observed on this study). The size of eddies (length scale) is \n\nhighest for geometries without nose and tail, decreasing for elliptical geometries and achieve \n\nits lowest size for conical geometries. Moreover, Drag decreases with the decrease of size.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nNumerical Validation  Chapter 5 \u2022 Numerical Analysis \n\n 66 \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2022 Conclusions  Difficulties \n\n 67 \n\nChapter 6 \n\n \n\n6 Conclusions \n\nAn experimental procedure has been developed to investigate the effects of velocity, angles of \n\nattack and length-to-diameter ratio on the forces and coefficients acting on a torpedo-shaped \n\nhull body travelling at fully submerged depth. Using the commercial software ANSYS FLUENT, \n\nnumerical simulations have been completed to validate them against experimental results. \n\nAt the beginning of this study, the objectives consisted in a hydrodynamic optimization, by \n\nExperimental Tests and Numerical Simulation, of a single-hull vehicle with similar dimensions \n\nof MEDUSA Deep-Sea lower-hull. However, due to several restrictions, the hull\u2019s dimensions \n\nwere adapted to make this study possible. Thus, these dimensions leaded to a need of a \n\nReynold\u2019s Number Similarity between full scale prototype and smaller hull prototype to predict \n\nhydrodynamic forces and coefficients. \n\n6.1 Difficulties \n\nAlthough the aim of this study was the validation of the Numerical Simulation with the \n\nExperimental Procedure, the Experimental Setup was, undoubtedly, the phase in which most \n\nissues occurred. The Experimental Setup process was, at the same time, very challenging and \n\nenriching.  This process was not considered at the beginning, however, due to its necessity, it \n\nwas also implemented. A lot of issues requiring a lot of time/efforts spent were encountered. \n\nMany considerations and procedures were adopted to overcome all of these complications. \n\nNevertheless, some of these issues were not possible to overcome, like the lack of a \n\ndynamometer (load cell) applied for lower tensions or the rail offset (relatively to towing tank). \n\nSeveral rails corrections were made, albeit with no success due to material deformity. The \n\nsolution adopted to avoid this problem was to find a location inside the towing tank, in which \n\nthe results were not affected by rail offset. Regarding to the dynamometer, several options \n\nwere attempted, like using load cells of a conventional balance weight or using a load cell \n\n(20kgs) with a MSP430 micro-CPU (Central Processing Unit), however these options were not \n\nwell succeeded.  \n\nFinding a functional thread to pull the towing carriage was also very challenging. The \n\nrequirements initially imposed were to find a thread with a low diameter that can be neglected \n\n(higher diameters could introduce low pitch angles on towing carriage when the thread was \n\nrolling) and that was able to hold relatively high tension forces (the tension necessary to start \n\npulling the towing carriage was up to twenty times more than the tensions observed and \n\nconsidered on this study). To avoid these tensions, the Frequency Inverter was programmed to \n\n\n\nResults  Chapter 6 \u2022 Conclusions \n\n 68 \n\nhave a slope at the Start/End of each run, i.e. during each run, the towing carriage started \n\ngradually to increase its velocity until reached the desired speed and the opposite happened at \n\nthe end. The returning process used was extremely hard to implement, due to the necessity of \n\nleaving a precise clearance at the returning thread to do not interfere on results. However, \n\nonce implemented, it was possible to fully control the towing carriage only with the Frequency \n\nInverter. \n\nThe Model Design/Prototype Manufacturing was also a challenging process. Although, as could \n\nhave been anticipated, the Prototype Manufacturing was made by a commercial company, \n\nleading to a number of restrictions imposed to the Model Design. This has led to continue \n\nmonitoring by a professional CAD designer to fully respect imposed restrictions. The AoA system \n\nwas a helpful method created to exactly respect the desired pitch angle. Many interactions \n\nbetween the Design and the Production of the prototype were observed and learned during this \n\nprocess. \n\nRegarding the results obtained from the Experimental Procedure, these seems acceptable. \n\nInitially, it was expected to predict clearly the hydrodynamic forces and coefficients for each \n\nspecific combination, although with the conditions imposed by materials that were being used, \n\nfinishing all the Experiments was not possible. However, the data collected was more than \n\nsufficient to later validate against the Numerical Simulation. Before data analyzing, and after \n\nin some cases, the Experiment Test Results were not coherent, demonstrating the influence \n\ncaused by several problems (as referred above). Nevertheless, as every Experimental \n\nProcedure, many lessons were learned during this process. It was concluded that the \n\ntemperature of the water used on the towing tank was a crucial parameter to this study (greatly \n\naffecting the Reynolds number used for the Reynold\u2019s similarity by varying the Density and \n\nViscosity). However, this parameter was not controllable by author. During a day, the water\u2019s \n\ntemperature could vary, depending on the laboratory\u2019s temperature.  \n\nThe Numerical Simulations were fully dependent to the computational time cost, leading to, in \n\nsome cases, some simulations longing for several days. Find an acceptable range of ?+ was also \n\nvery challenging. \n\n6.2 Results \n\nThe small dimensions of the towing tank directly interfered with Results, showing better Results \n\nfor smaller geometries. However, by the Numerical Study made, this is not always true. Thus, \n\nas proven by Figure 5.4, too small geometries produce higher Drag (influence of Eddies at \n\nStern). \n\nAnalyzing the geometries studied for Experimental and Numerical Studies, the Elliptical and \n\nConical Tail shape showed similar Results for both studies, although the Conical Tail shape \n\ndemonstrated to be the optimum configuration, producing the lowest Drag. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \u2022 Conclusions  Further Work \n\n 69 \n\nRelatively to the Experimental Results, N/D = 0.8 and T/D = 1.6 was the optimum configuration. \n\nAlthough there are some questionable results for high AoA\u2019s and velocities, especially for 20? \n\nof AoA and traveling at 1 m/s. However, these Results are quite interesting to note, once there \n\nis a lack of Towing Tank studies varying AoA\u2019s. Normally, studies made by other authors [52], \n\nobserve the effect of submergence depth, velocity or sideslip angle. Results demonstrate that \n\nAoA\u2019s greater than 20? should be avoided for further Towing Tank tests. \n\nThe Numerical Simulation was validated against the Experimental Tests, demonstrating a \n\npercentage Error between 27 and 36 %. This error difference could be optimized depending on \n\nCPU costs or using a more precise equipment on experimental procedure. However, the \n\nStandard ?-? Turbulence model showed a good prediction for Drag values using low \n\ncomputational costs, when compared with other Turbulence Models (as ?-? SST Model). \n\nSimulations also support the Experimental Tests Results on the optimum configuration, \n\npredicting the Conical Tail has the configuration that produces a lower Drag. Furthermore, \n\nthese Simulations also revealed a huge increase on Drag for higher AoA\u2019s (20?), denoting that \n\noperation under high AoA\u2019s should be avoid. \n\nIt can be concluded that, the Results, in general, showed a good and adequate agreement. \n\nAlthough, several considerations/methods can be adopted to improve Experimental and \n\nNumerical Results. Some of these considerations are going to be described in next section \n\n(Further Works). \n\n6.3 Further Work \n\nAs mentioned throughout this thesis, there are several considerations that were not accounted, \n\ndue to lack of some resources/equipment. Therefore, results can be improved by solving some \n\nof these mishaps or finding alternative solutions for them. Further Work is here purpose to \n\nimprove the results or to expand this study. These further work topics are: \n\n- A Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system should be used to precisely analyze the \n\nflow around the hull body. The phenomena observed could then be compared with \n\nNumerical Simulations to guarantee similar behavior of flow between Numerical \n\nand Experimental procedures; \n\n- Using other Towing Tank (higher dimensions) and a more precise Dynamometer, the \n\nTests should be repeated and other parameters can be also tested, as Sideslip \n\nangle; \n\n- Through other Turbulence Models (higher CPU cost), evaluate the difference of \n\nResults, justifying precisely the trade-off between Quality of \n\nResults/Computational Costs; \n\n\n\nFurther Work  Chapter 6 \u2022 Conclusions \n\n 70 \n\n- A complete study using ASE methods should be done for Experimental correction. \n\nThus, the error associated for each case (considering the error of each component) \n\nshould be determined; \n\n- A study of fairing\u2019s influence should be done. This study must comprise results for \n\ntests with and without fairings to evaluate its necessity; \n\n- A similar study should be done using a hull body with appendages to compare both \n\ncases. Drag should be measured, firstly, for hull body and then including all \n\ncomponents.  \n\n \n\n\n\nBibliography \n\n 71 \n\nBibliography \n\n \n\n[1] \u201cWoods Hole Oceanographic Institution.\u201d [Online].
