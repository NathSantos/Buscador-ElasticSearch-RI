In spite of the existence of several point bars in the area, only a selected group of beaches is used for\nnesting by P. expansa. Geological aspects, such as river width and depth, beach height \u2013 above 200 cm \u2013 with sandy sediments, were\nindispensable for the choice of these nesting sites. The relatively reduced dimensions of the point bars and the great number of\nturtles, which nest in the same local, contributed to the existence of a high nest concentration.\nThe rapid rise of the Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u River caused the flooding of the beaches and the drowning of hatchlings and embryos. It is\nestimated that nearly all the nests were lost. The height of the nesting place and the time of flooding related to the incubation period\nare decisive in embryo survivorship. The Retiro, J\u00fanior, Assombrado and Limoeiro beaches, which are situated at heights of 183 to\n310 cm, were inundated on 8 November 2000. The Barreira Branca beach, with a height of up to 380 cm was completely\ninundated on 13 December 2000. All of these beaches were flooded before the hatchlings emerged.\n\nKEY WORDS\ngiant Amazon river turtle, Araguaia basin, Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u River, nesting, Podocnemis expansa\n\nCaracter\u00edsticas geol\u00f3gicas das \u00e1reas de nidifica\u00e7\u00e3o da tartaruga-da-\namaz\u00f4nia (Podocnemis expansa) no rio Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u no Estado de Goi\u00e1s,\nBrasil\n\nRESUMO\nUma das maiores popula\u00e7\u00f5es de tartaruga-da-amaz\u00f4nia (Podocnemis expansa) da regi\u00e3o Centro-Oeste do Brasil nidifica ao longo das\npraias do rio Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u no estado de Goi\u00e1s.

Pieau (1971), working with fresh water turtles from\nEurope \u2013 Emys orbicularis e Testudo graeca \u2013 attempted to show\nthat turtles also possess temperature-dependent sex\ndetermination, and that it is usual that low temperatures produce\nmales and high temperatures produce females. However this\nwas not proven conclusively until Bull &amp; Vogt (1979).\nTemperature-dependent sex determination has now been shown\nto be common in turtles (Vogt &amp; Bull, 1982; Alho et al., 1985,\nEwert et al., 2004) as well as crocodilians (Ferguson &amp; Joanen,\n1989) and some lizards (Bragg et al., 2000, Harlow, 2004)\n\nThe giant Amazon river turtle (Podocnemis expansa) is the\nlargest fresh water turtle in South America, widely spread over\nthe northern and central western regions of Brazil, in the basins\nof Amazonas and Tocantins-Araguaia rivers (Pritchard &amp;\nTrebbau, 1984). Alho et al. (1985) have shown that the turtle\nhas temperature-dependent sex determination and that small\nvariations of about 1 \u00b0C in the incubation temperature are\nsufficient to produce significant alterations in the hatchlings sex\nratio. The temperature and humidity conditions of the turtle\nnests are very variable and sensitive to climatic oscillations.\n\nIn the Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u River the giant Amazon river turtle nesting\nsites are concentrated on sandy beaches, which appear on the\nriverbanks during the dry period. The nesting of the turtle in\nthe central-western region occurs between August and October,\nand hatching takes place in the months of November and\nDecember. The incubation duration, according to IBAMA\n(1989), varies from 45 to 60 days.\n\nSeveral different forms and different grain size sediments\nconstitute the beaches nesting for nesting. The maximum height\nof the beaches is decisive in hatchling success for two reasons.\nFirst, the river levels change rapidly in the central and northern\nregions of Brazil. So, if nests are located in a low topographic\nposition on the beaches hatchlings may drown before they\nemerge. Second, humidity originating from the underground\nwater table can reduce the nest temperature or drown the\nembryos.\n\nThe sudden rise of the river level, called \u201crepiquete\u201d is the\nmain cause for the loss of P. expansa, P. unifilis and P. sextuberculata\nnests in various parts of the Amazon region (Alho &amp; P\u00e1dua,\n1982; Hildebrand et al., 1988; Mitchell &amp; Qui\u00f1ones, 1994;\nPezzuti &amp; Vogt, 1999; Ferreira J\u00fanior, 2003).\n\nNesting of the giant Amazon river turtle occurs during the\nend of dry season, when sandy banks emerge close to the main\n\nfluvial channel borders. Usually they are point bars in the Crix\u00e1s-\nA\u00e7u River. The variety of beach forms, their dimensions and\ngrain size of the sand is variable, suggesting a wide hydric and\nthermal environment range. However, the nesting occurs only\nin specific points on a small number of beaches that, apparently,\nare carefully chosen by the giant turtle. Therefore, when the\nnumber of turtles is too large and space is scarce, nests are\nconcentrated. The turtle\u2019s gregarious nesting habit (Alho &amp; P\u00e1dua,\n1982; Ernst &amp; Barbour, 1989, Pritchard &amp; Trebbau, 1984;\nVanzolini, 1967) partially restricts the possible variations of the\nhydric and thermal environment that are acceptable hatchling\nsurvival.\n\nIn order to establish patterns of geological influence on the\nchoice of nesting places by this turtle, several studies have been\ncarried out in the Middle Araguaia and Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u rivers (Ferreira\nJ\u00fanior, 2003, Ferreira J\u00fanior &amp; Castro, 2003, 2005). The\ngeological aspects such as geomorphology and sedimentological\ncharacteristics of these beaches have been studied. This paper\nanalyzes the giant Amazon river turtle nesting areas in the Crix\u00e1s-\nA\u00e7u River in the state of Goi\u00e1s (Brazil) during the nesting season\nof 2000.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThe beaches were visited daily from August to December\n\nby the field agents working at the Centro de Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e\nManejo de R\u00e9pteis e Anf\u00edbios do Instituto Brasileiro do Meio\nAmbiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renov\u00e1veis (RAN/IBAMA),\nwho marked the nests with numbered stakes. Since the\nconcentration of the nests on the point bars was generally very\nhigh, it was impossible to locate all the nests. Therefore the\nIBAMA field agents estimated the number of nests based on the\ngiant Amazon river turtle tracks and excavations found. The\nlabeled nests were used as a reference for the measurements of\nthe relative height of the Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u River water level. The\nmapping of the beaches is on the scale of 1:1000 using compass\nand tape measure during October after the turtles had nested.\nThe height of the nests and the point bars were measured with\na level precise to 0.5 cm.\n\nOn October 25, we took measurements of the height of\nnests and beaches. Since the Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u River oscillated during\nthe nesting season, the lowest level was established as a reference\npoint. This procedure allowed the comparison among several\nbeach heights in different places. The pluviometric data that\nreferred to the variation of the Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u River level were made\navailable by the Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Energia El\u00e9trica (ANEEL)\nand originated from the Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u Station, situated at\n49\u00b057\u201905\u2019\u2019W and 13\u00b053\u201955\u2019\u2019S. This gauge station is located 15\nkm upstream from the Assombrado beach, which is the nearest\npoint to the study area.\n\nThe grain size of the sediment samples collected from the\nbeaches studied was analyzed using the grain size scale of Folk/\n\n\n\n2 5 12 5 12 5 12 5 12 5 1 VOL. 36(2) 2006: 249 - 258   FERREIRA J\u00daNIOR &amp; CASTRO\n\nGEOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NESTING AREAS OF THE GIANT AMAZON RIVER TURTLE\n(Podocnemis expansa) IN THE CRIX\u00c1S-A\u00c7U RIVER IN GOI\u00c1S STATE, BRAZIL\n\nWentworth (Folk, 1974) (Table 1).

There 1.700 giant Amazon river turtle females nested in\nonly five beaches spread over 25 km of the Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u River\n(Fig. 2) in 2000.\n\nBesides the IBAMA field agents\u2019 protection, the turtles have\na relatively well-preserved area of the Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u River to nest in.\nThe floodplain is characterized by several oxbow lakes. The\nvegetational cover is relatively well preserved on the right margin.\nHowever the left margin is more fragile, deforestation extends\nup to the riverbanks, with only a fragmented riparian forest\nremaining. The channel sinuosity is high with wide meanders\nbut short in extension.\n\nThe Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u River level varied 857 cm in 2000, with the\nhighest level registered on 20 December, and the lowest on 25\nOctober (Fig. 3). In 2000, during the months of June to October,\nthe Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u River reached its lowest level, exposing point\nbars (hereafter denominated beaches) that were used by the\n\nFigure 2 - Localization map of the studied area, highlighting the beaches\nwith greater concentration of the giant Amazon river tur tle nests in the\nnesting season of 2000.\n\nFigure 1 - Terminology used and features collected in mapping of the\nJava\u00e9s River point bars.

The river level decrease is slow and gradual,\nbut its rise is rapid and irregular.\n\nDuring the dry season, the Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u River level is so low\nthat, in many points, the river can be crossed on foot. The\nexposure of sandy bars within the channels causes the water to\nreach depths lower than 30 cm in several places. In this way, the\nmovements of turtle becomes very difficult and they concentrate\nin the river pools (called \u201cboiadouros\u201d), safe from their main\nnatural predator, the jaguar (Panthera onca).\n\nGRAIN SIZE ANALYSIS\n\nThe point bars, bars and river banks are formed by sediments\nwith several grain size fractions. The riverbanks are formed by\nmudstone, sandstone and conglomerate. The grain size fractions\nof bars and point bars are mud (clay and silt), sand and pebbles.\n\nThe results from granulometric analysis of five samples\ncollected along the turtle nesting areas in five beaches show that\nthe sediments concentrate primarily in the sandy fractions (Table\n2). The point bars are constituted by sediments classified as\ncoarse sand, with substantial contributions from sand classified\nas fine to very coarse. The mud volume is very low, less than\n0.2%. The Assombrado Beach had the coarsest sediments and\nthe Limoeiro and Barreira Branca beaches had the finest.\n\nDISTRIBUTION OF NESTS ALONG THE BEACHES\n\nAlmost all of the giant Amazon river turtle nesting occurred\nbetween 20\u201330 September 2000. A great number of the turtles\nlaid in two or three days and their nest concentration made the\nnest separation and counting impossible. The greatest nesting\nperiod coincided with the decrease of the Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u River level,\nwhich happened after a small rise of 26 cm, registered during\nthe first two weeks of September (Fig. 3).\n\nSince each of the five studied beaches present peculiar\ngeological characteristics and a differentiated nest pattern\ndistribution, they will be described separately.\n\nJunior Beach: It is a point bar with low nesting concentrations\nwhere only 23 turtle nests were registered (Fig. 4). The nests\nwere located at a maximum height that varied from 183 to 207\ncm above the Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u River level, on 25 October, which was\nthe day of the lowest channel water level. The well-developed\nbordering riparian forest constitutes the vegetational cover in\n\nthe internal side of the meander, which shades the nests that are\nclose to the forest.\n\nThe low nesting concentration on this beach is associated\nwith the dimensions and positioning of \u201cboiadouro\u201d (deep pool)\nand to its geomorphological and sedimentological characteristics.\nThe external border of the point bar near the upstream center\narea (Fig. 1) is shallow and the water flow is strong and rapid\nmaking it difficult for the turtles to move. A small \u201cboiadouro\u201d is\nlocated near the downstream part of the beach. It is separated\nfrom the point bar by a steep lee face of a great dune that migrates\ntowards the \u201cboiadouro\u201d. During the period in which the river\nis shallower, the river flow causes the erosion of the dune lee side,\nwhich makes the boundary between the beach and the\n\u201cboiadouro\u201d even more abrupt. At this place, exit for the turtle\nto the beach becomes very difficult, almost impossible. The\ncentral part of the point bar presents ramp-shaped morphology\nwith little inclination. At this point, the river presents a water\nvolume which permits the turtle to circulate along the channel.\nAt this juncture, the turtle can easily climb to the highest points\n\nFraction Pebble Gravel\nSand\n\n   Mud\nVery coarse Coarse Medium Fine Very fine\n\nJ\u00fanior 0,74 1,48 3,70 53,86 35,57 4,42 0,23 0,00\n\nAssombrado 7,61 9,30 24,42 47,49 10,08 0,60 0,35 0,16\n\nBarreira Branca 0,08 0,13 3,47 48,62 44,34 3,20 0,14 0,02\n\nLimoeiro 0,04 1,15 6,54 31,03 46,83 13,30 1,07 0,04\n\nRetiro 0,91 7,47 30,72 45,52 13,75 1,21 0,31 0,10\n\nTable 2 - Grain size mean (%) of the nest placement areas of the giant Amazon river tur tle in the Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u River.\n\nFigure 3 - Variation of the level of the Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u River and nesting period\nin 2000.

However, the local pebbly and gross substrate is\nnot compatible for digging nests.\n\nThe few registered nests on the J\u00fanior Beach are situated in\nthe central part of the point bar but not at the highest part that\nwas very close to the forest. Nests labeled 34 and 35 were situated\nin a sunny place almost all day long, but the height relative to\nthe river level was lower, since the place is a secondary channel\nthat cuts through the point bar. On 8 November, the point bar\nwas completely inundated, flooding all the nests and killing all\nthe hatchlings and embryos.\n\nAssombrado Beach: In the year of 2000, a great\nconcentration of giant Amazon river turtle nests along the\nAraguaia and Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u rivers occurred at this point bar (Fig.\n5). In a small area of approximately 1750 m\u00b2 (35 x 50 m), near\n500 nests \u2013 laid between 22\u201329 September. The height of the\nnest surface was from 180 to 213 cm and as on the J\u00fanior\nBeach, they were situated below the mean height observed on\nthe other three beaches. Nest counting was not an easy task,\nsince the nests were overlaid. The nest count estimated by IBAMA\nfield agents was based on the nest marks and on the tracks left by\nthe turtles.\n\nThe beach is relatively plain, without any dunes. As a\nconsequence there is not the amalgamation of deposits, which\ncould generate topographical levels and a greater environment\ncomplexity and diversity. The beach morphology is ramp-like,\nspotted by a margin with low angle of inclination that connects\nthe highest part of the beach to the \u201cboiadouro\u201d.\n\nThe geological characteristics of the beach are not adequate\nfor nesting since there is a sandy-silt layer as thick as 20 cm,\nwhich covers the entire point bar and makes digging nests\ndifficult. On the other hand, the beach has a \u201cboiadouro\u201d nearby,\nwhich permits turtle concentration during the nesting season.\nThis is the determinant feature for high nesting concentration\nin the Assombrado Beach. The river level was very low in 2000\nmaking transit along the river difficult for the turtles. The nests\nwere flooded on 8 November, before hatching.\n\nRetiro Beach: It is a point bar that is 500 m long and 90 m\nwide. The sandy deposits are more complex. The density of the\ngiant Amazon river turtle nest concentration is high, almost 250\n\nclutches in an area of 4500 m\u00b2. The presence of several\ntopographical forms, dunes and flat areas, influenced the nest\nplacement. The presence of a \u201cboiadouro\u201d in front of the beach,\naccess channels and adequate bank topography make access to\nthe nesting site easy for the turtle.

A lower nest concentration occurred in the places\nshaded by shrubby vegetation. There the height of the beach is\nlower than to 2 m (Fig. 6).\n\nTwo platforms characterize the Retiro Beach. The highest\nplatform, between 236 and 260 cm in height, where the turtle\nnests, can be subdivided in two portions: one upstream that\nconcentrates the nests, without vegetation and close to the\n\u201cboiadouro\u201d; the other downstream, which in spite of being\nhigh with a sandy substrate does not have nests, since it is covered\nby bushes and the \u201cboiadouro\u201d is not directly connected to the\nbeach. At this last portion, a very abrupt dune blocks the high\n\npart of the beach, making the access for the giant turtle difficult.\nThe area used for nesting by the turtle was flooded on 8\nNovember.\n\nLimoeiro Beach: It is a point bar 575 m long and 70 m\nwide, where jaguars prey on the turtles intensely. Seventeen\ngiant Amazon river turtles were found with marks of been killed\nby jaguars during the 2000 nesting season. The nest area is\nalmost 4000 m\u00b2 and the number of turtle nests is estimated at\nabout 200 to 250 (Fig. 7).\n\nThe nesting area was altered by the rising water during the\nlast flood period.

Upstream there are pebbly deposits\noriginating from the erosion of ancient conglomeratic deposits,\nmaking this point unfit for nesting.\n\nThe \u201cboiadouro\u201d is limited upstream by a dune that partially\nemerges during the dry period, determining the beginning of\nan area where the water flow is rapid and the river substratum\nbecomes gravelly and shallow, which makes the movement of\nthe giant turtle difficult. Downstream, the \u201cboiadouro\u201d is limited\nby shallow and gravelly bars. The access to the nesting place is\nmade by a ramp with a slightly inclined slope.\n\nIn spite of the point bar not having been totally flooded by\nthe rising water level on 8 November, the eggs did not hatch on\nthis beach. The clutch base of the turtle is about 60 cm deep\nand since the maximum height of laying in this beach was of\n310 cm, the height of the nest base was located about 250 cm of\nthe Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u River level. Since the swell of rising water on 8\nNovember reached 262 cm, all the nests had at least their lower\npart submerged. The nests sites on the entire Limoeiro Beach\n\nwas completely inundated on 13 December.\n\nBarreira Branca Beach: It is a point bar about 550 m long\nand 75 m wide. The highest point of the nesting area is located\n380 cm higher than the river level. Favorable nesting conditions\nappeared only in the highest parts of the beach. It is estimated\nthat 250 giant Amazon river turtles laid in this point bar (Fig.\n8). The \u201cboiadouro\u201d extends the width of the channel in front\nof the beach and the turtle aggregate prior to nesting is\ndownstream, where the water flow is lower and the river is wider\nand deeper.\n\nSandy and silt deposits characterize the Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u River\nbank in the right margin, opposite to Barreira Branca Beach. At\nits base there are conglomerates with gravel of up to 20 cm in\nsize, which after erosion and removal of the finest fraction compose\nthe residual gravelly deposits. In the specific case of Barreira\nBranca Beach, the location of the residual gravelly deposits does\nnot make turtle nesting impracticable since the concentration is\nin low topographical portions, which are avoided by the turtle.\n\nFigure 7 - Morphology of the Limoeiro beach and distribution of the giant\nAmazon river tur tle nests.\n\nFigure 8 - Morphology of the Barreira Branca beach and distribution of the\ngiant Amazon river tur tle nests.\n\n\n\n2 5 62 5 62 5 62 5 62 5 6 VOL. 36(2) 2006: 249 - 258   FERREIRA J\u00daNIOR &amp; CASTRO\n\nGEOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NESTING AREAS OF THE GIANT AMAZON RIVER TURTLE\n(Podocnemis expansa) IN THE CRIX\u00c1S-A\u00c7U RIVER IN GOI\u00c1S STATE, BRAZIL\n\nIn the highest sites of the point bar, the turtle clutch bases\nwere located at least 60 cm higher than the water table on 8\nNovember, when the rising water occurred. Thus, it may have\nbeen possible that some nests hatched. Unfortunately, after the\nrising water on 8 November, RAN/IBAMA suspended the\nreproductive season monitoring activities, as they had concluded\nthat all the nests were lost. The nest site was completely flooded\nonly on 14 December.\n\nDISCUSSION\nIn the area of the Crixas-A\u00e7u River monitored by IBAMA,\n\nfive beaches with a high nesting concentration were studied,\nwhere about 1700 P. expansa nested in 2000. The morphological\ncharacteristics of the nesting beaches are similar, allowing for a\ndiagnostic of geomorphologic and sedimentological patterns of\nthe sites chosen by the turtles for nesting. As a general\ncharacteristic, all the sites with high concentration nests can be\nclassified as point bars and the geological complexity of these\nbars will depend mainly on their dimensions. Smaller bars present\na simpler arrangement but usually without the platform\noriginated by the dunes migration and superposition. The point\nbars with smaller dimensions, such as Assombrado Beach, present\na ramp surface without significant unevenness. The scarce dunes\nfound upstream or downstream are usually lower than 50 cm in\nhigh.\n\nThe larger point bars, such as the Limoeiro and Retiro\nbeaches, show a more complex arrangement, where one can\nverify the amalgamation of several dunes more than 100 cm\nhigh, causing different morphological levels. The boundaries of\nthe dunes mark the morphological differences of the sites chosen\nby the giant Amazon river turtles for nesting. The absence of\nvegetational cover and the presence small dunes, and their loosely\npacked sediments suggest that the higher point bars\u2019 deposits\nare reworked by annual floods.\n\nThe substratum of the turtle nests is characterized by poorly\nselected sediments concentrated in the sandy fraction (Table 2).\nThe grain size of the sediments could be one of the criteria for\nthe turtle selecting nesting areas in the Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u River. The\nturtles always nested in the high beach areas, as long as the\nsediments are formed by sand. In the J\u00fanior Beach (Fig. 3), the\nhigh places covered by pebbles did not allow the digging of\nnests, and the turtles laid in the sandy sites, which were lower. In\nthe Assombrado Beach, the 20 cm mud layer had to be removed\nin order to dig the nests. This fact, combined with the high\nnumber of nests, increased nest overlap, since nest digging\nbecame easier in the sites where the mud layer had already been\nremoved by giant Amazon river turtles nesting previously.\n\nThe presence of residual gravel deposits is controlled by the\nregional geological structure. There is a discrepancy between the\ngravel sizes, usually over 15 cm, and the energy of the Crix\u00e1s-\n\nA\u00e7u River, indicating that the present water flow cannot transport\nclasts with these dimensions. The present river course cuts\nTertiary-Quaternary sedimentary deposits of the Bananal\nFormation (Bayer et al., 2001; Latrubesse et al., 1999; Mamede\net al., 1981). The presence of conglomeratic deposits is frequent,\nand these can extend for hundreds of meters and can be up to\n150 cm thick. The conglomeratic levels have an interlayer with\nsandy and silt-sandy deposits. The erosion of the conglomeratic\ndeposits causes the removal of the finer clasts by the water flow.\nIn this way, only the large clast fraction, such as gravel and\npebble, remains in the place, and when they are transported\nthey go for small distances, generating residual gravelly deposits.\nDepending upon the original Tertiary-Quaternary conglomeratic\ndeposits, these deposits may occupy significant portions in the\npoint bars as it happens in the case of the J\u00fanior Beach, or small\nsections, as exemplified in the Limoeiro and Barreira Branca\nbeaches. During the lowing of the river level, a silt-sandy layer\nup to 20 cm thick may accumulate over the sandy deposits. In\nsome sites this layer is thin and can be easily removed by turtles\nor desiccated by rain and wind. In the Assombrado Beach,\nhowever, a relatively uniform layer more than 10 cm thick covers\nentire extension of the point bar. The area used for nesting by\n500 turtles had to be dug on the silt-sandy layer in order to\nreach an adequate substratum for the nests. Therefore, the\ndigging of the superficial muddy layer demands an extra effort\nby the turtle, since the material becomes dry and very cohesive\nwhen dehydrated after being exposed to the sun. The high\nconcentration of turtles in this site and the laying space restrictions\ncontribute to a high nesting concentration with a great number\nof overlapping nests.\n\nThe maximum height of the nesting sites varied along the\nbeaches and was over 200 cm on average, relative to the Crix\u00e1s-\nA\u00e7u River in 2000. These areas are located in the point bars\u2019\nintermediate part, where the migration and amalgamation of\nthe sedimentary deposits generate morphological levels, which\nprovide good nesting conditions for the turtle. The height of\nthe nest sites was decisive for the hatchling success. The nests\nlocated on the J\u00fanior, Assombrado, Retiro and Limoeiro beaches\nwere flooded due to the rise of the Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u River on 8\nNovember. Some areas of the Barreira Branca Beach, located in\nthe highest places, had only been completely flooded as of 14\nDecember, what probably allowed for the hatching and the\nemergence of the hatchling from some nests.\n\nSudden rising of the water level is usual in the Amazonian\nrivers and the consequences on the hatchling success depend on\nthe rising water magnitude and the height of the nest sites.\nPezzuti &amp; Vogt (1999) mentioned that the greatest\nconcentration of nests of P. sextuberculata (75.6%), in the Japur\u00e1\nRiver in Brazil happens on the highest sites of the beaches.\nMitchell &amp; Qui\u00f1ones (1994) found a positive correlation\nbetween the beach height and the number of nests of P. unifilis\n\n\n\n2 5 72 5 72 5 72 5 72 5 7 VOL. 36(2) 2006: 249 - 258   FERREIRA J\u00daNIOR &amp; CASTRO\n\nGEOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NESTING AREAS OF THE GIANT AMAZON RIVER TURTLE\n(Podocnemis expansa) IN THE CRIX\u00c1S-A\u00c7U RIVER IN GOI\u00c1S STATE, BRAZIL\n\nin Peru. Hildebrand et al. (1988) concluded that the loss of\nnests of the giant Amazon river turtle in Caquet\u00e1 River in\nColombia, was due to the rising of the water oscillating from 0%\nto 100%. Soini (1995) has showed a similar phenomenon in\nthe Pacaya-Samiria national reserve in Peru, where the rising of\nthe water inundates from 1% to 100% of the P. expansa, P.\nunifilis e P. sextuberculata nests.\n\nIn the study area various other point bars occur that are not\nused by the giant Amazon river turtle due to, at least, four reasons:\na) inexistence of \u201cboiadouros\u201d near the beaches, which makes\naggregation in shallows, prior to landing, impossible, as described\nby Vanzolini (1967); b) insufficient height of the point bars,\nwhich are lower than 150 cm; c) absence of safe connection\namong the pools of the river (\u201cboiadouros\u201d), which makes the\nturtles moving to new nesting areas difficult for the turtles and\nd) inadequate substratum formed by gravel size sediments or\nmud sediments. All these reasons \u2013 acting individually or together\n\u2013 make the nesting difficult for the giant Amazon river turtle in\nalmost all the point bars of the Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u River. Only a few\nbeaches fulfill the necessary nesting requirements, which allied\nto the turtle\u2019s gregarious habits (Alho &amp; Padua, 1982; Vanzolini,\n1967), causes high concentration of nests in small areas.\n\nThe high nest concentration, and their consequent\nsuperposition in very small areas, is due to the lack of wider\nsuitable areas and of a greater geological diversity in the point\nbars. The few point bars over 200 cm high that present associated\n\u201cboiadouros\u201d are widely used by the turtle as nesting site. This\ncharacteristic directs the protection and monitoring of the turtle\nin the reproductive season to the small areas with large number\nof nests. On the other hand, sudden rising water level, such as\nthe one that happened on November 8th, can affect survivorship,\nas was verified in 2000. This happens because the nesting sites\nare high enough to permit great variations of the river on water\ntable levels to occur without damage to the eggs. The\nconcentration of nests in restricted areas can also cause the\nincubation of a great hatchling number in similar thermal\nenvironments, which could induce production sex ratio bias\n(Bull, 1980; Bull, 1985; Vogt &amp; Bull, 1984). Greater\nenvironment diversity contributes to the distinct boundary\nconditions of the nests that could influence the embyogenesis\nand the sexual determination in different ways (Alho et al., 1985;\nPackard et al., 1987). Studies on the hatchling sex ratio generated\nin these environments will be necessary in order to determine\ntheir influence.\n\nThe analysis of the giant Amazon river turtle nest sites in the\nCrix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u River shows the influence of the geological aspects\nin the nesting areas. The grain size of substratum, the presence\nof \u201cboiadouros\u201d and high beach areas (over 200 cm) are important\naspects for local high nest concentration. The same geological\naspects as those listed to Crix\u00e1s-A\u00e7u River are also important for\nother giant Amazon river turtle nesting areas such as in the\n\nAraguaia River, in the state of Goi\u00e1s, and in the Java\u00e9s River, in\nthe state of Tocantins as shown by Ferreira Junior (2003) and\nFerreira J\u00fanior &amp; Castro (2003, 2005).\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n This paper is part of the Ph.
