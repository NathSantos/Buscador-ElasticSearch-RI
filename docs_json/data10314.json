In contrast with its\npredecessor, information age in which the core business was and still is to develop monolithic\nintangible goods and profiting using licensing fees and strict control of software copying,\nconnected age comes in the picture when enterprises started monetizing the human behavior\non the web. [1] With the evolution and rise of technologies such as smart phones and tablets,\nand with the proliferation of network access points, to be or not connected is in the tip of your\nfinger. Thus social networking became a huge thing, from Facebook to Youtube, and even\nTwitch TV (streaming service), all services that profit with the connectivity of people. Also\nthe availability to buy and download products from the web (music, films, games) cause a ever\nincreasing demand of network bandwidth, therefore the network it self must evolve in order\nsatisfy the users needs, new future services and maintain a certain Quality of Service (QoS).\n\n1.1 Context and Motivation\n\nWhen it comes to select an ideal solution for an Access Network (AN) there is a continuous\nstruggle to balance infrastructure investments against the need to deliver stronger financial\nreturns. It is with this factors in mind that Passive Optical Networks (PONs) for access come\nin the picture.\n\nIn a PON, a single fiber between the Optical Line Terminal (OLT) and the Remote\nNode (RN) is shared by all users connected to it. The network between the OLT and the\nOptical Network Units (ONUs) is passive, which means that there is no need of any power\nsupply in this path.\n\nPON standardization started in the early 1990s, by the hands of the Full Service Access\nNetwork (FSAN) working group, and led to the creation of APON in 1995, which later was\nimproved to Broadband Passive Optical Network (BPON) in 1998, redefining it in 2005 to\nallow higher bit rates. The maximum data rates achievable for this technology are 1.2 Gb/s\nand 622 Mb/s for downstream and upstream respectively. [2] [3]\n\nIn 2001, FSAN group started the development of GPON (Gigabit Passive Optical Net-\nwork), standardized in 2003 by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), to keep\npace with the increasing demand for bandwidth. This later standard supports downstream\nbit rates up to about 2.5 Gb/s and upstream bit rates up to about 1.25 Gb/s. [2] [4]\n\nAll currently deployed PON based on the standards referred before are known as Time-\nDivision Multiplexing Passive Optical Networks (TDM-PONs) architectures since they rely\n\n1\n\n\n\non TDM technology. Upstream transmission is accomplished by time sharing the available\nbandwidth between all subscribers (TDMA), while downstream operation is performed by\nsending all data to all ONUs, being these responsible to select the data destined to the\nsubscriber(s) associated. [2] [4]\n\nDue to progressive massification of new types of traffic (such as 3DTV and cloud-based\nservices) the ITU has already ratified new standards. 10\u00d7Gigabit Passive Optical Net-\nwork (XG-PON1) was standardized in 2010. It allows 10 Gb/s and 2.5 Gb/s bit rates for\ndownstream and upstream transmissions, respectively. Next-Generation Passive Optical Net-\nwork 2 (NG-PON2) specifications are being standardized, the first set of recommendations\nwas issued in the start of 2013, G.989.1. [5], allowing 40 Gb/s symmetrical bandwidth, using\na Time and Wavelength Division Multiplexed Passive Optical Network (TWDM-PON) based\narchitecture, with a Point-to-Point Wavelength-division multiplexing (PtP WDM) PON over-\nlay.\n\nTWDM-PON increases the aggregate PON rate by stacking four XG-PON1 using four\npairs of wavelengths. The only significantly new components in TWDM, and used for sim-\nple network deployment and management purposes, are colourless tunable transmitters and\nreceivers.\n\nThe NG-PON2 specifications for wavelength plan, and channel spacing are covered by the\nwell matured tunable devices technologies developed for core/metro networks, (full C-band or\nL-band with more than 80 channels). However, they require a considerably reduced number\nof wavelength channels. Although there is a need for low volume of TWDM downstream\ntransceivers and costs will be shared across multiple subscribers, when it comes to choose an\nupstream Transmitter (Tx) low cost solutions are preferable. Taking this into consideration,\nNG-PON2 specifications defines three types of ONU Tx [5]: calibrated, loosely calibrated and\nuncalibrated. Therefore multiple tuning mechanisms must be enabled in the PON in order\nto activate and deal with the different kinds of ONUs.\n\nNG-PON2 systems takes advantage of the tunable Tx and Rx, not only they provide\ncolorless ONUs and pay-as-you-grow deployment, some advanced network functions resulting\nfrom in-service wavelength tuning techniques may feature in the system as well. The maximum\nservice interruption required for in-service tuning in NG-PON2 is 50 ms [5] Therefore tuning\ntime is an important ONU parameter, which will be decisive regarding the implementation\nor not of in-service tuning functionalities.\n\n1.2 Structure and Objectives\n\nThis document is divided in 5 chapters, and the main objectives are the following:\n\n\u2022 Overview of the NG-PON2 recommendation.\n\n\u2022 Study the available tunning mechanisms in NG-PON2 systems.\n\n\u2022 Overview on tunable transceivers.\n\n\u2022 Testing of tunable lasers available in the laboratory, regarding the tunable characteris-\ntics.\n\nIn the first chapter are presented the context and motivation, structure and objectives, as\nwell as the contributions according to the author\u2019s opinion.\n\n2\n\n\n\nThe second chapter presents the state of the art, in that sense PON\u2019s preponderance in\naccess networks is reviewed as well as the Legacy PONs structures and main features in order\nto introduce the NG-PON2 systems.\n\nIn the third chapter an overview of the NG-PON2 recommendation is presented, with a\nfocus in the tunable characteristic of the network architecture. The relevant parameters of\ntunable ONUs are briefly described and a quick overview on tunable lasers\u2019 tuning mechanisms\nand receivers is also presented.\n\nFourth chapter features a characterization of tunable transceivers to be used in NG-PON2\nas well as the experimental results on a transceiver tuning time measurement and accuracy.\n\nFinally in the fifth chapter conclusions taken from the carried out work are presented as\nwell and some future work related to this topic is suggested.\n\n1.3 Contributions\n\nIn the author\u2019s opinion the main contributions of this work are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Identification of the currently available tuning mechanism to be used in NG-PON2\ndeployment, distinguishing three types of tuning mechanisms regarding the use of cali-\nbrated, loosely calibrated and uncalibrated transmitters.\n\n\u2022 Characterization of a tuning transmitter to be used in NG-PON2, tunable time mea-\nsurement, and determination of tuning accuracy for a DFB laser.\n\n3\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nState of Art\n\n2.1 Telecommunication Network\n\nA modern telecommunication network general structure consists of three main sub net-\nworks: backbone or core network, metro or regional network, and the access network. Fig.\n2.1 presents a simple scheme of a telecommunication network. The Backbone Network as\nthe core, interconnects all metro/regional networks of a country. The Metro Networks aggre-\ngate the high traffic from access networks\u2019 (AN) Central Office (CO), transport the data at\nhigher speed, pass that traffic addressed to other metro/regional areas to the core network\nand delivers to the respective central office the remaining traffic.\n\nFigure 2.1: Architecture of a telecommunication network [2]\n\n5\n\n\n\nThe core and metro networks structures are usually more uniform that the access network,\nand have their cost shared by a large number of users. Finally, the access network which\nprovides end-user connectivity, e.g. AN is the bridge between the user and the service provider.\n\nTable 2.1: Characteristics of the several types of a telecommunication network [6]\n\nNetwork Type Characteristics\n\nCore Has active elements;\nLow granularity;\nLow variation in traffic flow;\nOperate with a lower number of protocols than\nmetro networks;\nTransport traffic over long distances;\nUse a irregular mesh topology;\n\nMetropolitan Has active elements;\nMedium granularity;\nMedium fluctuation in traffic flow;\nCovers high density population areas;\nUse ring topologies;\n\nAccess Passive optical network (PON);\nHigh granularity;\nHigh fluctuation in traffic flow;\nOperate with a variety of protocols (IP, ATM,\nEthernet);\nCovers small distances;\nHave a wide variety of topologies implemented\n\n2.2 Optical Access Network\n\nNowadays the most cost efficient solution in access networks is the PON, which makes\nthe fiber access one of the most important technologies in the next generation networks.\nBefore overlooking the role of PON\u2019s in AN, is of the most importance to understand what\nan AN is. An AN provides the connection between subscribers and service providers, it is the\nlast segment of an operator network which enables users to access the network itself, either\nto transmit or receive data, voice and so on. Optical AN are constituted of an optical line\nterminator (OLT) located at the CO, Remote Node (RN), and a Optical Network Unit (ONU)\nto terminate the fiber.\n\n6\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: High-level architecture of an access network [6]\n\nAn AN can be perceived as two distinct networks, the distribution and the feeder network,\nas can be seen in Fig.2.2 The first one connects the RN with the respective ONUs, and the\nsecond one connects the CO with the RNs. The RN can be active or passive.\n\n2.3 PON and the FTTx Network Models\n\nAccording to Ovum [7] PON is, nowadays, the dominant FTTx technology due to the\ncost advantages of its point-to-multipoint architecture compared to other solutions. Ovum\nalso forecasts that more than 90% of the expected 300 million FTTH subscribers in 2019 will\nbe PON Networks. Fig. 2.3, represents the several applications models of an optical access\nnetworks, the so called FTTx. The different architectures are characterized by the fiber length\nand the ONU location relatively to the user end [4]. Citing, Fiber to the Curb (FTTC), Fiber\nto the Building (FTTB) and Fiber to the Home (FTTH).\n\n7\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: FTTx application model in PON [4]\n\nPONs are the attractive solution for the FTTx due to the inherent characteristics of its\npassive RN, Fig. 2.4 represents the architecture of an FTTH PON, in contrast, and active RN\nrequires constant power supply, backup power, and additionally, a cabinet for its placement,\nraising the Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operating expense (OPEX).\n\nFigure 2.4: Passive optical network architecture [4]\n\n8\n\n\n\nPON is a Point to Multi-point (P2MP) system, as it is referred before. Some authors\nargue that P2P optical network can be considered a PON due to connection between the\nOLT and the ONU being completely passive. Nevertheless the most common and widespread\ndefinition to PON is P2MP.\n\nThe feature of passiveness makes the network deployment flexible and advantageous [6]:\n\n\u2022 Both, equipment and fiber in the CO are shared (smaller number of fibers in feeder),\nproviding lower cost than in a Point to Point (P2P) solution. Above all, power supply\nis not needed for the RN, greatly reducing the CAPEX;\n\n\u2022 Trough the removal of the active equipment, there is a reduction in the electromagnetic\ninterference, decreasing the failure rate of the line and the external equipment. This\nprovides easy maintenance, lower CAPEX and also lower OPEX;\n\n2.4 Legacy PON Systems\n\nITU Study Group 15 Q2 completed the recommendations that define a GPON (gigabit\npassive optical network) [ITU series G.948] in 2004, since then, FTTx based on PON have been\nlargely deployed. Full Service Access Networks (FSAN), along with the ITU are the forum and\nthe standardization entities with the greatest activity in study this type of networks. Their\npoint of view on next generation networks divides the evolution on two stages, NG-PON1 and\nNG-PON2, the first one is known as 10\u00d7Gigabit Passive Optical Network (XG-PON1) and it\nis considered as short-term solution, a transition technology, standardized since 2010, while\nNG-PON2 technology is seen as a medium-term solution (2015) Fig. 2.5, its standardization\nwas initiated on the beginning of 2013 [5].\n\nFigure 2.5: PON Evolution [8].\n\n9\n\n\n\n2.4.1 G-PON\n\nGigabit passive optical network (G-PON) is currently a mature technology, ITU started\nworking on G-PON in 2002 and there is the G.984.x series of recommendations, standard\nseries define general characteristics of GPON (G.984.1) as well as physical layer specification\n(G.984.2), transmission layer specification (G.984.3) and ONU (Optical Network Unit) man-\nagement and control specification (G.984.4). G-PON has an enhanced capability comparing\nwith its predecessors, APON and BPON (ATM PON which evolved in to Broadband PON),\nand is backward compatible. Being G-PON a passive network, only the OLT and the ONU\nare active equipments.\n\nG-PON architecture\n\nSarting from the Central Office (CO), only one single-mode fiber strand is connected to a\nsplitter near the users\u2019 end, Fig.2.6.\n\nFigure 2.6: Typical GPON architecture [9]\n\nThe optical splitter simply divides the signal into N separate paths to the subscribers.\nFrom this point, the number of paths that the optical power can be divided into may vary\nfrom 2 to 64, thus the split ratio capability of a G-PON network is 1:128. After the splitting,\nindividual single-mode fiber strand run to each user (home, businesses, etc.). The optical\nfiber transmission span from the central office to the each user can be up to 20 km [9].\n\nThe network is capable of supporting the bandwidth requirements of business and residen-\ntial services and covers systems with lot of different line transmission rates for downstream\nand upstream direction.\n\n10\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: GPON Nominal bit rate [9].\n\nTransmission Direction Bit Rate\n\nDownstream\n1244.16 Mbit/s\n2488.32 Mbit/s\n\nUpstream\n\n155.52 Mbit/s\n622.08 Mbit/s\n1244.16 Mbit/s\n2488.32 Mbit/s\n\nG-PON trasmission and main features\n\nThe operating wavelength range is 1480-1500 nm for the downstream direction and 1260-\n1360 nm for upstream direction. In addition, the wavelength range 1550-1560 nm can be used\nfor downstream RF video distribution, Fig.2.7.\n\nFigure 2.7: G-PON wavelength allocation\n\nDownstream transmission, on G-PON, consists in broadcasting fixed frames of 125\u00b5s\nfrom the OLT to the ONUs. Although all the ONUs receive the same data, GEM port ID\nare imbued in the frames which allows them to be differentiated therefore a filtering process\nwill occur in the ONUs, a respective ONU will only receive data that was aimed to it in the\nfirst place [10] [11].\n\nFigure 2.8: Downstream Transmission.\n[12]\n\nUpstream transmission, a multiple access protocol is used Time Division Multiple Access\n\n11\n\n\n\n(TDMA), Time Division Multiple Access in order to avoid packet collision. Each ONU has\na respective time window when they are allowed to transmit upstream data. An Upstream\nBandwidth Map is sent in the downstream frames which regulates time attribution to each\nONU [10] [11].\n\nFigure 2.9: Upstream Transmission\n[12]\n\nFeatures such as Forward Error Correction (FEC) and Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation\n(DBA) are enabled .FEC is a mathematical signal-processing technique that encodes data so\nthat errors can be detected and corrected. DBA is a methodology that allows quick adoption\nof users bandwidth allocation based on current traffic requirements [10] [13] [14].\n\nSecurity and Protection\n\nRegarding security, in the upstream direction G-PON uses point-to-point connection so\nall traffic is secured from eavesdropping. When it comes to downstream, the basic function-\nality of G-PON is that data is broadcast to all ONUs and every ONU have allocated time\nwhen data belongs to it (TDM). This could present a problem, since a malicious user could\nreprogram his own ONU to receive all downstream data belonging the other ONUs connected\nto that respective OLT. To prevent the referred security issues the GPON recommendation\nG.984.3 describes the use of an information security mechanism to ensure that users are al-\nlowed to access only the data intended for them. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is\nencryption algorithm that is used, it accepts 128, 192, 256 byte keys which makes the en-\ncryption extremely hard to compromise. Thus this key can be changed periodically, without\ndisturbing the information flow, to enhance security [10].\n\nThere are two types of protection switching, Automatic switching and Forced switching.\nThe first one is triggered by fault detection, such as loss of signal, loss of frame, signal degrade\nand so on. The second one is activated by administrative events, such as fiber re-routing,\nfiber replacement, etc. However, protection is considered as an optional mechanism because\nits implementation depends on the realization of economical systems.\n\n12\n\n\n\n2.4.2 XG-PON/NG-PON1\n\nXG-PON (10-Gigabit-capable passive optical network) is a technology already standard-\nized in the ITU Recommendations G.987.x, since 2010, and defines a mechanism migration\nto acquire transmissions of 10Gbit/s downstream and 2.5Gbit/s upstream. As it was referred\nbefore, XG-PON is viewed as a short-term solution, therefore, there are few technological\nsuppliers, few interoperable equipment between manufacturers and few interested operators.\nXG-PON can be seen as the natural evolution of the G-PON Networks, nevertheless the need\nfor larger bandwidth will lead operators to evolve directly into NG-PON2 [8], since its stan-\ndardization is expected within this year, there are already the ITU Recommendation G.989.1\nwhich defines the general requirements as well as physical layer specification G.989.2.\n\nWavelength plan is defined in ITU Recommendation G.987, Fig.2.10\n\nFigure 2.10: Allocation of G-PON XG-PON wavelengths\n[8]\n\nThe operating wavelength range is 1575-1580nm for the downstream direction and 1290-\n1330nm for upstream direction. Coexistence of XG-PON with the G-PON technology is\npossible within the same fiber that requires a WDM filter in the CO to combine the users\nsignal and the RF-Video [10] [13] [15], Fig.2.11.\n\nFigure 2.11: G-PON and XG-PON coexistence\n[8]\n\n2.5 Tunable Light sources\n\nSemiconductor lasers have the potential to meet demands for next generation high speed\noptical networks. Their low cost, wide tunability, low power consumption, and very good\nspectral response make them ideal transmission sources. Colorless components will be es-\nsential in NG-PON2 deployment. In the this section we will review some characteristics of\n\n13\n\n\n\nsemiconductor lasers, in particular the tuning mechanisms behind such devices that provide\na colorless mode of operation within a determined wavelength range.\n\n2.5.1 Semiconductor lasers\n\nSemiconductor lasers are popular optical communication light sources for high speed data\ntransmission. They are accepted as \u201cthe laser of the future\u201d, due to their compactness,\neasy integration, and high output powers. Coherent emission is produced in these lasers\nby stimulated emission, and the gain is achieved in the active medium of semiconductor by\nelectrical injection [16]. Their gain material is usually a compound of elements from columns\nIII and V of the periodic table. Typically they operate in the 1310-nm or 1550-nm region of\nthe spectrum.\n\nThese diode lasers are compact, therefore, they are developed on a large scale using\nvery mature fabrication technologies. Semiconductor lasers are very efficient in converting\nelectrical power into optical power [17]. In order to study such type of device is important\nto first understand the basic structures and operations that comprise semiconductor lasers.\nFrom the simplest diode laser to the most complex one, all structures function on the same\nprinciple, an active medium (gain medium) is placed between two mirrors (Distributed Bragg\nReflectors, High and Anti-reflector coatings or distributed grating), while the active medium is\nstimulated by injecting a current in order to produce emission, the mirrors provide a feedback\nand a selective function. When stimulated emission occurs, light from unwanted modes is\nreflected into the cavity in order to stimulate more photons. In short their wavelength is\ndetermined both by the properties of the III-V gain medium and by the physical structure of\nthe laser cavity surrounding the gain medium [18].\n\n2.5.2 Distributed Feedback Laser Diode (DFB)\n\nIn the DFB laser diode the active medium is periodically structured as a diffraction\ngrating, figure 2.12 (bottom). The grating povides feedback and its wavelength (corrugation\nperiod) determines the wavelength emitted from the laser. The tunablity in this type of\nlaser is achieved by thermally change the reflection index of the grating, thus this type of\ndevice is tunable in a narrowband, typically under 5nm. A conventional DFB laser\u2019s emission\nwavelength can be tuned by heating or cooling with a gradient of about 0.08 nm/K. Widely\ntunable devices using DFB technology are available by incorporating various laser cavitys in\nthe same device, DFB arrays, figure 2.12, coarse tuning is achieved by selecting the correct\nlaser bar, and fine tuning is done thermally.\n\n14\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: DFB Structure array [19].\n\n2.5.3 Distributed Bragg Reflector laser (DBR)\n\nThe DRB laser structure lies within the placement of at least one Bragg Reflector outside\nthe gain medium (active region) at one end of the resonator, and the other end may have\nanother DBR, Figure 2.13a shows the schematics of a simply DBR laser. The gratings\nprovides a wavelength-dependent feedback and thus a single-mode operation can be achieved.\nAlthough DBR lasers are usually a single-frequency laser, they present a small tunable range\nwithin the operating wavelength, this tuning is associated with the thermal characteristics of\nthe Gratings, the reflection index of the grating can be changed by driving it with a current.\nMoreover a tuning within the free spectral range of the laser resonator may be accomplished\nwith a separate phase section, which can be electrically heated, or simply by varying the\ntemperature of the gain region via the drive current, wider tunning can be achieved by adding\nmore sections, figure 2.13b.\n\n(a) 2 section DBR Laser (b) 3 section DBR Laser\n\nFigure 2.13: DBR laser schematics [20]\n\nDBR Tunable Lasers are electrically tunable, e.g., different modes are locked by injection\ncurrent into one, or more existing sections of the laser, furthermore the lasing wavelength is a\n\n15\n\n\n\nfunction of a multi-reflection-peak resultant of the feedback provided by the one or more DBR\nmirrors inside the cavity, lasers using this technology, such as, SG-DBR [21], SSG-DBR [22],\nGCSR [23], DS-DBR [24], DCG-DBR [25], have been widely reported in literature. In Table\n2.3, some parameters and characteristics regarding this type of laser are presented.\n\nTable 2.3: DBR Tunable Lasers [21] [22] [23] [24] [25].\n\nLaser-Parameter Output Power Tuning range SMSR Structure Tuning Currents\n\nDigital Supermode DBR\n(DS-DBR)\n\n?14 dBm 45 nm >40 dB\nFront and Rear Gratings,\nGain and Phase Section.\n\nFront (0 - 200 mA)\nRear (0 - 60 mA)\n\nSampled Grating DBR\n(SG-DBR)\n\n?4 dBm 38 nm >40 dB\nFront and Rear SGDBR mirrors,\nLever, Gain and Phase Sections.\n\nN/A\n\nSuper Structure Grating DBR\n(SSG-DBR)\n\n?9 dBm 40-60 nm >35 dB\nRear and Front Reflectors,\nGain and Phase Sections.\n\nFront (0 - 15 mA)\nRear (0 - 18 mA)\n\nDigital Concatenated Grating DBR\n(DCG-DBR)\n\n?14 dBm 60 nm >30 dB\nRear and Front Concatenated\nGratings,Gain and Phase Sections.\n\nFront (0 -30 mA)\nRear (0 -40 mA)\n\nGrating assisted codirectional\nCoupler with rear Sampled\ngrating Reflector (GCSR)\n\n?14 dBm 40 nm >30 dB\nRear Reflector, and Coupler in\nthe Front Section, Gain and\nPhase Section\n\nFront (0 - 16 mA )\nRear (0 - 16 mA)\n\n2.5.4 External Cavity Laser (ECL)\n\nThe ECL is based on a laser diode where the cavity is completed with external optical\ncomponents and typically as one Anti-reflection coating end. The external components can\nvary, as well as the setup their set, nevertheless the external setup is made of a set of lens\nin order to provide a collimated beam, and some kind of diffraction grating in order to\nprovide wavelength selectivity. Wavelength tuning is possible by including and adjustable\nelement, a mirror or a diffraction grating, usually by mounting it on a structure such as a\npiezoelectric crystal. Figure 2.14 shows two types of configuration, a) Littrow configuration,\nb) is Littman\u2013Metcalf configuration, the first one exhibits better output power, since the\nbeam is reflected only once, in the other hand the second offers better wavelength selectivity.\n\nFigure 2.14: ECL Structure [26].\n\nThis type of structure provides a very wide tuning range, and a very narrow linewidth,\nbut a relatively slow tunning.\n\n2.5.5 Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSEL)\n\nVCSEL achieve single longitudinal mode operation in different manner, the structures\npresented before are edge emitting lasers while the VCSEL a surface emitting laser. The\ncavity is placed between two highly reflective Bragg Reflectors (99.5% on the emitting surface\n\n16\n\n\n\nand 99.9% on the other surface), one of the advantages of VCSEL lies within its structure,\nwhich provides a easier way to couple the emitted light into fiber. In the VCSEL tunability\nis achieved by including Micro-electro-mechanical (MEMs) part in the structure, the lasing\nwavelength is therefore selected by a combination of MEMs and thermal Tuning, figure 2.15.\n\nFigure 2.15: VCSEL Structure.\n\nVCSEL/MEMs structures present relatively wide tunning, 30nm, but there is one concern\nin using MEMs, that lies within their long term mechanic reliability.\n\n2.5.6 Lasers based on Hybrid III-V on SOI (Silicon-on-insulator)\n\nHybrid III-V on SOI devices integrates the advantage of III-V efficient light emission and\namplification with the low loss and high index contrast waveguiding, for efficient spectrum\nfiltering and tuning, of the silicon. The studied devices, are presented in [27, 28], use a set\nof extra-cavity ring resonators (RRs), and Bragg Reflectors (optional) in order to form two\nresonating structures with slightly different free spectral range (FSR), the RRs can thermally\ntuned, and the difference in the RR\u2019s FSR allows taking advantage of the Vernier Effect for\nwavelength selectivity and tunning. Also the FSR difference of the rings will determine the\ntuning range of the device. Such devices present wide tuning range 40 to 45 nm, and high\nvalues of SMSR, above 40 dB, and narrow linewidth, in the order of a few hundred kilohertz.\nSimilar devices may be realized using at set of extra-cavity ring resonators on a Fabry-Perot\ncavity.\n\nBased on the presented content above, it can be concluded that semiconductor lasing is\nassociated with laser\u2019s cavity length, and intrinsic properties of the semiconductors used in\nthe active sections. These properties rule the single-wavelength lasing characteristics of a\nlaser. As far as tunability goes, three distinct categories can be distinguish: Temperature,\nCurrent Driven and Mechanical. The three are not mutually exclusive, since there are devices\n\n17\n\n\n\nwhere a combination of at least two types are used. Table 2.4 summarizes the characteristics\nof the different tunning categories.\n\nTable 2.4: Categories of tunability\n\nTuning Mechanism Wavelength Range Tuning Speed\n\nTemperature NarrowBand 5nm Slow (sub-s order)\n\nMechanical\n(MEMs,\npiezoelectric transducer)\n\nWideBand\nECL - 100nm\nVCSEL- 30nm\n\nVery Slow (s-order)\n\nCurrent Driven Wideband - >30 nm Fast (ns to \u00b5s order)\n\n2.6 Tunable Filters\n\nIn NG-PON2, a tunable wavelength selection device is required in the ONU, because each\nONU should be able to get access to all wavelengths for dynamic bandwidth allocation. The\nwavelength selective filter is required to have wide tuning range to maximize the number of\nchannels that can be selected, negligible crosstalk to avoid interference from adjacent channels,\nfast tuning speed to minimize the access time, small insertion loss, polarization insensitivity,\nstability against environmental changes (humidity, temperature, vibrations, etc.), and last\nbut not the least, low cost [18]. Microring-resonator, thin film filter, Bragg gratings, Bragg\nreflectors, liquid crystal tunable filter, thermally tuned and angle tuned FP filters are the\nresearch focus. Several techniques will be introduced as example.\n\n2.6.1 Microring resonator\n\nThermally tunable Si microring resonator (MRR)filter with flat-top passband is a promis-\ning candidate for WDM signal processing, because it is compact and easy to be integrated\nwith other Si devices, including electro-optic modulators, optical routers and reconfigurable\noptical add drop multiplexers (ROADMs), etc. A thermally tunable Si 3rd order MRR filter\nhas been proposed, which shows a box-like response with low intra-band ripple ( 0.65 dB),\nlow insertion loss (less than 0.9 dB) and out-of-band rejection higher than 40 dB. By applying\npower to TiN heaters, the filter can be thermally tuned over the whole feedback shift register\n(FSR) of 3 nm with the tuning efficiency of 48.4 mV/nm [29].\n\n2.6.2 Silicon Fabry-Perot filter (FPF)\n\nFPF, also called as etalon, is realized by a silicon wafer with both sizes carefully polished.\nThe incoming light experiences a multiple-beam interference. As a result, the wavelengths\nthat match the resonant conditions are selected at the filter output as indicated in Eq 2.1\n\n?m = (2nLc cos ?)/m, (2.1)\n\nwhere n is the etalon reflective index, Lc is its length. By varying the reflective index or\nthe length of the FP resonator, we can tune the output wavelength of the FP filter. For the\nreflective index tuning, we can use thermo optic effect, which is the refractive index variation\ninduced by a temperature change. The thermo-optic effect is very strong and the thermally\ninduced expansion of a silicon wafer is very poor, resulting in a large pre valence of the\n\n18\n\n\n\nthermo-optic effect. A thermal tuning coefficient of 0.083nm/K is obtained at 1550 nm. The\ndevice can also be tuned by changing the optical path length in the cavity, which may be\nachieved mechanically, thermally, or electro-optically. Hence, the FP filter is a versatile and\nflexible component and a prime candidate for a wavelength selective filter in TWDM-PON\nsystems. Furthermore the main advantage of fiber FP filters is that they can be integrated\nwithin the system without incurring coupling losses.\n\n2.6.3 Thin Film Filter (TFF)\n\nAs a group, micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS) Fabry-Perot devices tend to possess\nwide tuning range, but have an serious limitation. They are structurally restricted to the\nsimplest type of single-cavity etalon design. Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition\n(PECVD) is the preferred process for dense, compliant, homogeneous optical coatings of thin\nfilm silicon [30]. It is known that thin film narrowband filters may be tuned by mechanical\nrotation of the angle of incidence [31]. Nonetheless TFF including an integrated heater for\nthermal tuning were presented in [32]\n\n2.6.4 Fiber Bragg grating (FBG)\n\nFBG is also a technology to keep in mind due to its sharp spectral filtering character-\nistics and low insertion loss. Conventionally, the Bragg wavelength of FBGs can be shifted\nby imparting either the strain or temperature effect on a uniform FBG. Temperature change\nlinearly shifts the Bragg wavelength through the refractive index variation of the grating\ninduced by the thermo-optic effect [33]. Mechanically induced strain physically extends or\ncompresses the grating period, which leads to a linear shift of the Bragg wavelength in con-\njunction with the refractive index change in the grating through the strain-optic effect. The\nexcellent tolerance of silica-glass fibers to mechanical strain makes strain tuning preferable\nfor achieving a wide tuning range.\n\nTunable receivers and tunable transmitters have been a research topic of optical transport\nnetworks for more than a decade, therefore there is a great deal of development practice in\nthis area. The NG-PON2 system applications takes advantage of this component development\neffort in a couple of ways. Frist, the NG-PON2 tunable transceivers reuse mature tunable\noptical transport network components, if one technology does not perform to expectations,\nthere is always other options to provide the required function. This versatility reduces the risk\ncomponent availability. Second NG-PON2 can provide significant relief on the specifications\nof tunable optical transport network components. Because the NG-PON2 wavelength tuning\nperformance could be relaxed from that of the optical transport network and NG-PON2\nchannel rates are widely used in the optical transport network, critical tuning requirements,\nsuch as wavelength tuning range, tuning speed, channel spacing, can be dramatically relieved.\nSuch performance relaxation offers significant yield improvements during the mass production\nand cost reductions for tunable transceivers. [34]\n\n19\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nNG-PON2 General Requirements\n\nThe next generation passive optical network stage 2(NG-PON2) project was initiated by\nFSAN community in 2011. [35] The project\u2019s goal is to investigate optical fiber networks\ntechnologies enabling a bandwidth increase beyond the XG-PON\u2019s 10Gbit/s in the access\nnetwork.\n\nNext-Generation Passive Optical Network 2 (NG-PON2) is a multifaceted system, capable\nof meeting the different needs of a wide range of networks in a diverse market, and is deployable\nin several applications in a efficient manner. Taking in consideration that the ODN represents\n70% of sum of the investments in the PON roll-out, NG-PON2 will not be a disruptive solution\nsince re-utilizes the ODN infrastructure from previous PONs. Characteristics from legacy\nPON systems and ([ITU G.982], [ITU G.983], [ITU G.984], [ITU G.987]) are maintained as\nmuch as possible, as well as the re-use of established technical capabilities, to ensure some\nbackward compatibility with the already exiting ODN\u2019s.\n\nMany PON technologies have been proposed to provide broadband optical access beyond\n10 Gb/s. There are the 40 Gigabit time-division multiplexed PON (40G TDM-PON) pro-\nposal [36] which increases the single carrier serial downstream bit rate of a 10 Gigabit PON\n(XG-PON) [15] to 40 Gb/s, the time- and wavelength-division multiplexed PON (TWDM-\nPON) proposal which stacks multiple XG-PONs using WDM [37], a group of WDM-PON pro-\nposals which provide a dedicated wavelength channel at the rate of 1 Gb/s to each ONU with\ndifferent WDM transmit or receive technologies [38] [39] a set of orthogonal frequency-division\nmultiplexed (OFDM)-based PON proposals which employ quadrature amplitude modulation\nand fast Fourier transform to generate digital OFDM signals for transmission [40] [41]. How-\never, the requirement for backwards compatibility blocked of the way for WDM-PONs because\nthey require wavelength selective ODNs. 40G TDM-PON is also out of consideration due to\nthe cost pressure of 40G components in each user and the fiber chromatic dispersion would\ngreatly limit transmission distance [42]. Other options are eliminated due to either techni-\ncal immaturity or time-frame requirement. As result, all attentions turned to TWDM-PON,\nwhich attracted the majority support from global vendors and was selected among all of the\naforementioned proposals by the FSAN community in April 2012 as a primary solution for\nNG-PON2, with PtP WDM overlay channels.\n\n3.1 System Overview\n\nNG-PON2 system requirements include support for [5]:\n\n21\n\n\n\n\u2022 Multiple wavelength channel TWDM architecture.\n\n\u2022 4-8 TWDM channel pairs (each channel pair comprising one downstream and one up-\nstream wavelength channel), configurable for incremental growth starting from one de-\nployed channel pair (i.e., not all channel pairs need to be active); for example, \u201cpay as\nyou grow\u201d capability of TWDM populating in the OLT.\n\n\u2022 Downstream and upstream nominal line rates per channel:\n\n\u2013 10 Gbit/s downstream and 10 Gbit/s upstream\n\n\u2013 10 Gbit/s downstream and 2.5 Gbit/s upstream\n\n\u2013 2.5 Gbit/s downstream and 2.5 Gbit/s upstream\n\n\u2022 Passive fiber reach of at least 40 km and maximum differential fiber distance up to 40\nkm with configurable maximum differential fiber distance as 20 km and optionally 40\nkm,\n\n\u2022 Capability to reach 60 km, preferably with passive outside plant,\n\n\u2022 Support for a split ratio of at least 1:256.\n\nNG-PON2 systems require flexibility to balance trade-off in speed, distance, and split\nratios for numerous applications. The set of parameter combinations that are supported by\nthe system must include:\n\n\u2022 40 Gbit/s downstream capacity and 20 km reach with at least 1:64 split ratio,\n\n\u2022 10 Gbit/s upstream capcity and 20 km reach with at least 1:64 split ratio,\n\n\u2022 Access to peak rates of 10/2.5 Gbit/s downstream/upstream,\n\n\u2022 Longer distances with lower split ratios are also possible.\n\nNG-PON2 systems may also support:\n\n\u2022 40 Gbit/s downstream capacity with 10 Gbit/s per upstream channel and 20 km reach\nwith at least 1:64 split ratio,\n\n\u2022 2.5 Gbit/s per downstream channel and 2.5 Gbit/s per upstream channel with 40 km\nreach with at least 1:32 split ratio,\n\n\u2022 10 Gbit/s per downstream channel and 10 Gbit/s per upstream channel with 40 km\nreach with at least 1:32 split ratio,\n\n\u2022 Acces to peak rates of 10/10 Gbit/s downstream/upstream,\n\n\u2022 Tunable PtP WDM with capability to co-exist with other PON systems.\n\n22\n\n\n\n3.2 Architecture\n\nThe Basic NG-PON 2 architecture is shown in Figure 3.1. TWDM-PON increases the ag-\ngregate PON rate by stacking four XG-PON1 using four pairs of wavelengths (e.g, wavelength\npairs of {?1?,?1?},{?2?,?2?},{?3?,?3?} and {?4?,?4?} in Fig.3.1). A TWDM-PON system\nwith four pairs of wavelengths is able to provide 40Gbit/s downstream and 10Gbit/s upstream\nwith 40 km reach and 1:64 split ratio. Each ONU can provide peak rates of 10Gbit/s and\n2,5Gbit/s downstream and upstream, respectively, meeting the NG-PON2 requirements.\n\nFigure 3.1: NG-PON 2 system diagram [43]\n\nThe PtP WDM overlay allows NG-PON2 to meet demanding operator requirements for\nbusiness and back haul services. On the PtP WDM each ONU is served by a dedicated\nwavelength channel. In the baseline configuration, eight channels of PtP WDM are considered\nto allow full co-existence with legacy systems. Furthermore, depending on the particular\ndeployment scenario, unused spectrum may be dedicated to additional PtP WDM channels.\n\n3.3 Line Rates\n\nThe line rates defined for NG-PON2 systems are presented in Table 3.1.\n\n23\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: NG-PON2 Line Rate [5].\n\nTWDM Downstream Line Rate (Gbit/s) Upstream Line Rate (Gbit/s)\n\nBasic Rate 9.95328 2.48832\nRate Option 1 9.95328 9.95328\nRate Option 2 2.48832 2.48832\n\nPtP WDM Downstream/Upstream Line Rate (Gbit/s)\n\nClass 1 1.2288\u20131.2500\nClass 2 2.4576\u20132.6660\nClass 3 9.8304\u201311.09\nClass 4 6.144\n\n3.4 Wavelength Plan\n\nAs might be expected, with each generation of PON, the availability of unallocated spec-\ntrum diminishes. Co-existence with legacy PONs and RF Video relies on the NG-PON2\nwavelength plan. Some considerations were made regarding the elaboration of two distinct\nwavelength plans, considering the presence or not of RF Video. However the idea did not\nmove forward, a single wavelength plan is a more attractive approach since it would mean a\nworld wide standard.\n\nThe Upstream bands fo TWDM (table 3.2) are located in the C-band where there is\nhigh availability in components which will facilitate lower costs in the ONUs. TWDM down-\nstream is allocated in the L-band, although technology is not so matured, there is a need\nfor low volume of TWDM downstream transceivers and costs will be shared across multiple\nsubscribers.\n\nTable 3.2: NG-PON2 Wavelength Plan [5].\n\nTWDM Upstream Wavelength Band (nm) Downstream Wavelength Band (nm)\n\nWide 1524-1544\nReduced 1528-1540 1596-1603\nNarrow 1532-1540\n\nPtP WDM Downstream/Upstream Wavelength Band (nm)\n\nShared 1603-1625\nExpanded 1524-1625\n\nIt may be noted that there are three upstream wavelength band options available, that\nwere specified for TWDM-PON. These options are motivated by differing capabilities of the\nONU transmitter to control its wavelength. A variety of techniques may be employed in\norder to control the wavelength in the upstream direction from the ONU to OLT. Neverthe-\nless, temperature is the primary parameter of control. The wide option may be used by a\n\u201dWavelength-set\u201d [44] approach to channel control, where the transmitter is allowed to drift\nin wavelength over a wide range, as the OLT de-multiplexer has cyclic pass bands. As for the\nnarrow option a more precise transmitter is needed, since it will be of the utmost importance\nfor it to precisely lock onto an assigned DWDM wavelength.\n\nIn downstream direction, eight channels have been specified with a fixed channel spacing\n\n24\n\n\n\n(CS) of 100Ghz from 187.1Thz to 187.8Thz. In the upstream direction CS of 50, 100 and\n200GHz are to be supported, although no channel plan has been recommended it can be\nassumed that the ONU transmitter will adapt to whatever grid is employed by the OLT\nde-multiplexer.\n\nIt can be noticed as well that two bands were specified for the PtP WDM channels, the\nreasoning behind this fact will be further explained. The Shared Spectrum option, as it\u2019s\nname implies, is the wavelength plan to be applied in a scenario of full coexistence with\nlegacy PON systems (G-PON, XG-PON1 and RF Video). The Expanded Spectrum option\nexploits the concept of spectral flexibility of NG-PON2 by enabling unused bands, in any\nparticular deployment, to be utilized by PtP WDM. The Expanded Spectrum option may\nalso be the option to go to in a Greenfield scenario, with no legacy coexistence limitations.\n\n3.5 Advanced Network Functions\n\nThe wavelength agility of NG-PON2 systems allows network functionalities that were\npreviously unavailable in Legacy TDM-PONs. By exploiting the wavelength agility inherent\nto the tunability of the NG-PON2 ONUs new use case scenarios are opened up. The attractive\nnetwork functions resulting from the use of wavelength tunability in services are:\n\n\u2022 Incremental upgrade of the system capacity, or pay-as-you-grow (PAYG)\n\n\u2022 OLT power saving\n\n\u2022 Load Balancing among OLT ports\n\n\u2022 OLT-port protection\n\n\u2022 Flexible bandwidth assignment such as Dynamic Wavelength and Bandwidth Allocation\n(DWBA)\n\nFurthermore, a NG-PON2 architecture featuring the functionalities listed above as already\nbeen demonstrated [45]. Table 3.3 summarizes the relationship between network functions ,\ntuning frequency and the required tuning time. Some of this function will be addressed in\nfurther sections.\n\n25\n\n\n\nTable 3.3: Network function and Tuning Frequency/Time [46]\n\nFunction Description Tuning Frequency Tuning Time\n\nColorless ONU\nEliminates complicated inventory management\nand improper connections between a colored\nONU and an OLT.\n\nLow\n(only initialization)\n\nLong\n(s order)\n\nAdvanced Power\nSaving\n\n(OLT-port sleep)\n\nFor example, when there is less traffic, all\nONUs are connected to one OLT-port and the\nother ports can be forced to sleep.\n\nMedium\n(per hour or day)\n\nMedium\n(ms order)\n\nOLT-port Protection\nWhen an OLT-port as failed, ONU can\ncontinue its communication to other OLT-ports\nby changing its wavelength.\n\nLow\n(OLT-port Failure)\n\nShort\n(ns - ms order)\n\nPay-as-you-grow\n(Incremental upgrade)\n\nAfter installation of ONUs, the total\nbandwidth can be increased\nincrementally by istalling additional OLT-ports.\n\nLow\n(only initialization)\n\nLong\n(s order)\n\nLoad Balancing\nWhen the traffic of one OLT-port is\nheavily congested, some ONUs are assigned\nto communicate to other vacant ports.\n\nLow\n(per day or week)\n\nMedium\n(ms order)\n\nFlexible Wavelength\nAssignment\n\nThe optimized wavelength and timeslot are\nassigned to each ONU in order to improve\nthe usage efficiency of the wavelength and\nprovide bandwidth according to user\ndemand (DWBA).\n\nHigh\nShort\n\n(ns - \u00b5s order)\n\n3.5.1 Spectral Flexibility\n\nSpectral Flexibility is one of the key features introduced in NG-PON2, it will facilitate a\ndiverse range of deployment scenarios, network applications and evolution paths. In a practi-\ncal sense, and as it was explained before, whenever a particular subset of optical spectrum is\nunused by TWDM and/or Legacy PON systems PtP WDM may make use of that particular\nsub-band.\n\nSuch flexibility can facilitate the support of different customer types on the same ODN\nin a flexibly way. Additionally, spectral Flexibility facilitate a range os system coexistence\nscenarios and allows operators to \u201dre-use\u201d new wavelength bands when legacy systems are\ndecommissioned.\n\n3.6 Coexistence with Legacy PONs\n\nThe wavelength plan of NG-PON2 will facilitate its coexistence with Legacy PON systems.\nRegarding XG-PON1, NG-PON2 predecessor, the system uses wavelength overlay in order\nto permit each system to operate independently in a common fiber infrastructure. Not only\nsimultaneous coexistence with legacy PON systems is achieved, but as well with 1555nm RF\nVideo, figure 3.2 shows the NG-PON2 wavelength plan with inclusion of G-PON, XG-PON1\nand RF Video.\n\nThe TWDM-PON downstream channels fit between XG-PON1 downstream and the mon-\nitoring band (labeled OTDR). On the other hand the TWDM-PON upstream channes work\nin the C-band which is expected to deliver lower cost optical transceivers at the ONUs.\n\nThe Shared Spectrum wavelength band for PtP WDM is shown in Figure 3.2, and it is\nconfigured as a mixed downstream and upstream plan, which will be assigned according to\nthe network operator requirements.\n\n26\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: NG-PON 2 wavelength Plan [47]\n\n3.7 ODN Considerations\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in NG-PON2 deployment relates to operator requirements\non the ability to re-use already installed PON fiber-infrastructure, therefore NG-PON PMD\nhas been designed to be compatible with power splitter based ODNs. In order to re-use\npower-splitter based ODNs, already deployed for Legacy PON systems, the optical path\nlosses supported by NG-PON2 transceivers must also be compatible.\n\nFurthermore, the need for coexistence with Legacy PONs driven the NG-PON2 standards\nto assign the same nomenclature and values of the optical path loss used in XG-PON1.\nThese values and classification of ODN can be seen in Table 3.4, and as it can be seen, the\nrequirement for compatibility with a 15dB ODN loss has been maintained. On further notice,\nthe 40Km fiber distance from the OLT to the furthest and closest ONU respectively is also\nsupported on NG-PON2.\n\n27\n\n\n\nTable 3.4: Classes for Optical Path Loss in NG-PON2 [5]\n\nODN Class N1 N2 E1 E2\n\nMinimum Loss (dB) 14 16 18 20\nMaximum Loss (dB) 29 31 33 35\n\nOn a scenario where NG-PON2 needs to comply with Legacy PONs, and thus provide\nbackward compatibility, the support of power-split only is mandatory. Two classes of PtP\nWDM ODN architectures are described in G.989: one requires tunable filters as the wave-\nlength selection device, on the ONU, thus called Wavelength Selected ODN (WS-ODN). The\nother one, Wavelength Routed ODN (WR-ODN) uses wavelength splitters in the ODN, which\nallow a wavelength routing capability, figure 3.3. Nevertheless, the two are not mutually ex-\nclusive as PtP WDM ODN can be made as a combination of both, providing a hybrid solution\nwhich can take advantage of both configurations.\n\nFigure 3.3: WS-OND with power splitter (top) and WR-ODN with lumped cyclic AWG\n(bottom). Relevant interface reference points are also shown [48]\n\n3.7.1 Wavelength Selected ODN\n\nNG-PON2 systems support single-stage splitting as well as multi-stage splitting, the re-\nquired support for the maximum split ratio is of at least 1:64. For coexistence with legacy PON\nsystems, a wavelength-band multiplexer, which is referred to as Coexistence Element (CE),\nenables them to be combined in a single ODN. Maximum Reach can be traded off against\nsplit ratio, since the power loss using splitter devices scales with the total split ratio.\n\n3.7.2 Wavelength Routed ODN\n\nNG-PON2 systems entirely based on a WR-ODN only make sense in a Green-field de-\nploymente scenario, when the PtP WDM makes use of the Expanded Spectrum configuration.\nDue to the lower insertion-loss of the wavelength splitters compared with power splitters, WR-\nODN can provide either a longer reach or the usage of transceivers with lower budget classes.\n\n28\n\n\n\nNote that NG-PON2 systems need a Wavelength Multiplexer (WM) in order to combine\nmultiple wavelength channels into the same ODN. The WM is considered an integrated com-\nponent of the OLT equipment, in that sense the extra loss from the WM is not part of the\nODN loss, which is specified from the output of the WM (the S/R-CG reference point) to\nthe input of the ONU (R/S reference point). S/R-CG refers to the location where the OLT\nsends/receives a set of DS/US wavelength channel pairs, called Channel Group (CG), to/from\nONUs. At the OLT, a logical Channel Termination (CT) function terminates each individual\nTWDM or PtP WDM channel.\n\nThe WM, and the wavelength splitters for WR-ODN may be realized with Arrayed Waveg-\nuide Grating (AWG) or Thin Film Filters (TFF)\n\n3.7.3 Hybrid ODN\n\nAs it was mentioned before, an NG-PON2 system can comprise a Hybrid configuration of\nWS and WR ODN types. Such approach, in comparison to WS-ODN, can provide a higher\nsplit ration for the same OPL Classes. Example shown in Figure 3.3, is relative to a two\nstage power splitting ODN with a 26-28 dB loss budget. Replacing the second stage power\nsplitter with an AWG, results in a 16-18 dB loss budget, allowing a more reasonable power\nbudget [48]. Other possible configuration would be to use a wavelength splitter in the first\nstage, and grouping wavelengths as wavelength sets on the second stage, all wavelengths are\nsent to the ONUs as a single set via power splitter. [44]\n\nFigure 3.4: Hybrid ODN and WS-ODN in comparison [48]\n\nIn short, NG-PON2 can support a choice of ODNs, i.e, WS-ODN, WR-ODN or even a\ncombination of both. WR-ODN offers the advantage of reduced splitting loss that may be\nused in order to achieve extended system reach or allowance for the use of lower specification\ntransceivers, and is more attractive towards rural areas and Green-field scenarios. Also, some\nservices could make use of the physical layer channel isolation offered by wavelength splitting\nto offer virtual private line services using wavelength channels. Whereas WS-ODN has a\nstronger affinity toward (dense) urban ares, in particular if legacy ODNs are already in place.\n\n29\n\n\n\n3.8 Key technologies\n\n3.8.1 Transmitters\n\nThe NG-PON2 wavelength plan defines the C-band and L-band for US and DS respec-\ntively. Therefore the expected specifications for tunable Transmitter (Tx) in the ONUs are\n4-channel tunability, respecting the chosen CS (50 GHz, 100 GHz or 200 GHz) in the C-band,\na line rate of 2,5 Gbit/s (most likely for residential service) or 10 Gbit/s (most likely for\nbusiness and mobile services), and burst-mode operation.\n\nThese specifications are covered by the well matured tunable devices technologies devel-\noped for core/metro networks, some of them were previously addressed in section 2.5 (full\nC-band or L-band with more than 80 channels). However, they require a considerably reduced\nnumber of wavelength channels and burst-mode capability [49]. Table 3.5 shows examples of\npossible tunable Tx to be employed in a NG-PON2 ONU.\n\nTable 3.5: Possible Tunable transmitters in the ONU [49]\n\nType A A\u2019 B C\n\nDevice\nHeater-Integrated\n\nDFB-LD\nEML (TEC\n\ninside)\n\nDBR-LD\n(short cavity\n\ntype)\n\n4h EML array +\nSelector (SW)\n\nTuning\nControl\n\nThermal Thermal Electrical Electrical (SW)\n\nTuning\nTime\n\nsub-s order sub-s order\n<ns (LD\n\nchip level)\n<100 ns\n\nModulation Direct mod.\nExternal\n\nmod.\nDirect mod.\n\nExternal\nmod.\n\nDCT for\n10 Gbit/s\n\n3 7 3 7\n\nType A is a conventional uncooled direct modulated DFB, but needs an integrated heater\nand temperature sensor for an on chip tunabilty [50].\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\u2022 Small size.\n\n\u2022 Low cost.\n\n\u2022 Easy burst-mode operation.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n\u2022 Long tuning time.\n\n\u2022 Needs Dispersion Compensation Tech-\nnique (DCT) for 10 Gbit/s operation.\n\nType A\u2019 is similar to the DFB previously mentioned, has an integrated modulator and\nThermo-Electric Cooler (TEC) inside the module.\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\u2022 Small size.\n\n\u2022 Low cost.\n\n\u2022 Does not need DCT, due to external\nmodulation.\n\n30\n\n\n\nDisadvantages: \u2022 Long tuning time\n\nType B is a Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR), one problem with this laser is that might\nsuffer from mod-hop problem, but one solution is to adopt a short cavity design [?]\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\u2022 Very short tuning time.\n\n\u2022 Small size.\n\nDisadvantages\n\n\u2022 Needs DCT for 10 Gbit/s operation.\n\n\u2022 More costly than previously solutions.\n\nType C is a composed of a 4-channel arrayed device, an optical multiplexer, and an\nelectric Wavelength Channel Selector (SW), figure3.5 [51]\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\u2022 Short tuning time.\n\n\u2022 Mode hop free.\n\n\u2022 Does not need DCT, due to external\nmodulation.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n\u2022 Bulky Size.\n\n\u2022 Complex configuration for monolithic\nintegration.\n\n3.8.2 Receivers\n\nSimilarly to the T-Tx, tunable receivers in the ONU are expected to have a 4-channel\ntunability, with 100GHz channel spacing (CS for the NG-PON2 DS) in the L-band and line\nrates of 2.5 and 10 Gbit/s. Implementing Tunable Rx in NG-PON2 represents one of the\nmajor challenges in the system deployment. It will be the first time that a tunable Rx will\nbe implemented in a practical manner in the telecom field [49], which is an indicator that\ntunable Rx technology is less mature than tunable Tx. Table 3.6 shows examples of possible\ntechnology solutions for ONU Rx.\n\nTable 3.6: Possible solutions for ONU Rx [49]\n\nType X Y Z\n\nDevice\nHeater-integrated\n\nTFF + PD\n\nDeMUX + 4ch\nAPD array +\nselector SW\n\nDeMUX + SOA\ngates + PD\n\nTuning\nControl\n\nThermal Electric SW Optical Selector SW\n\nTuning\nTime\n\ns order&lt;20 ns&lt;1.5 ns (chip level)\n\nType X consists of a heater-integrated TFF pin-PD. The TFF is tuned by applying a\ncurrent to the integrated heater, which shifts the central wavelength of the TFF. Thin film\nfilters come in a small package, and offer a low cost solution, however they present a long\ntuning time, sub-s order.\n\n31\n\n\n\nType Y is similar to Type C Tx, is composed of a 4-channel APD-arrayed device, an\noptical demultiplexer (DeMUX) and a SW, as shown in figure [51]. This Rx, was confirmed\nto have short tuning time&lt;20 ns [49].\n\nType Z consists of a DeMUX, Semiconductor Optical Amplifier (SOA) gates, and a\nPD [52]. The SOA gates act as a wavelength selector, selecting the designated wavelength\namong the demultiplexed wavelengths with high speed tuning time of 1.5 ns. Although the\nuse of the DeMUX is the same as the previous device, Type Z offers wavelength selection in\nthe optical domain, while Type Y selects the wavelength at the electrical domain.\n\nFigure 3.5: (a) 4 channel array EML (b) 4 channel array APD [51]\n\nTable 3.7 presents which type of solutions can be achieved by employing the aforemen-\ntioned Tx and Rx in an NG-PON2 system. 7 marks the Tx and Rx that would be incompatible\nregarding the tuning time, from operation point of view does not make sense to have a fast\nTx and a Slow Rx or vice versa.\n\n3.8.3 Minimum Tuning Window\n\nThe minimum tuning window refers to the difference between the highest and the lowest\noperating frequencies/wavelengths of a tunable device, achievable by means of tuning control.\nTable 3.8 shows the minimum tuning window required for TWDM-PON ONU transmitters\nin NG-PON2 systems considering 50Ghz, 100Ghz and 200Ghz channels spacing and four and\neight wavelength channel pairs. Regarding the PtP WDM-PON architecture in NG-PON2\nsystems, the minimum tuning window is based on the operating wavelength band.\n\nTable 3.8: Minimum Tuning window for TWDM-PON ONU transmitters [5]\n\nMinimum Tuning Window Channel Spacing 4 channels 8 channels\n\n50 Ghz 250 Ghz 450 Ghz\nWhen using Cyclic Channel Grid 100 Ghz 500 Ghz 900 Ghz\n\n200 Ghz 1000 Ghz 1800 Ghz\n\n50 Ghz 175 Ghz 375 Ghz\nWhen not using Cyclic Channel Grid 100 Ghz 340 Ghz 740 Ghz\n\n200 Ghz 650 Ghz 1450 Ghz\n\n32\n\n\n\nTable 3.7: Use cases for with Tx and Rx solutions presented in tables 3.5 and 3.6\n\nTx/Rx Type X Type Y Type Z\n\nType A\n\nLow cost Solution.\nResidential users.\nMight only provide\nColorless ONU &amp;\nPAYG\n\n7 7\n\nType A\u2019\n\nLow cost Solution.\nResidential users.\nMight only provide\nColorless ONU &amp;\nPAYG\n\n7 7\n\nType B 7\n\nSuits Resilient Services.\nBusiness users.\nSupport all functions\nfrom table 3.3\n\nSuits Resilient Services.\nBusiness users.\nSupport all functions\nfrom table 3.3\n\nType C 7\n\nSuits Resilient Services.\nBusiness users.\nSupport all functions\nfrom table 3.3\n\nSuits Resilient Services.\nBusiness users.\nSupport all functions\nfrom table 3.3\n\n3.9 ONU Tunablity\n\nBy employing the use of colorless ONUs for NG-PON2, it is essential for the ONU trans-\nmitter and receiver to have wavelength tunability. Therefore, it expected from NG-PON2\nsystems to have advanced network functions resulting from in-service wavelength tuning tech-\nniques. In-service tuning means that an ONU can tune its wavelength during service operation\nin addition to ONU\u2019s initializing process.\n\nRegarding the ONU tunability it is then essential to have mechanism of wavelength as-\nsignment, tunning and maintenance. Thus, some necessary functions must be enabled:\n\n\u2022 initiate the ONU discovery process, and recognize new ONUs on the PON and their\ntunability in a way that does not disrupt traffic;\n\n\u2022 to assign a newly recognized ONU to an initial operating wavelength set, both upstream\nand downstream;\n\n\u2022 to reassign an ONU\u2019s opertaing wavelength set during operation;\n\n3.9.1 Wavelength Assignment and Tunning\n\nWavelength assignment is critical in order to bring inactive ONUs into operation. At the\ntime a new ONU is installed initial downstream and upstream wavelength set have to be\nautomatically and remotely assigned between the OLT and the new ONU. This wavelength\nassignment process has to be carried out as part of the ONU activation. In a case where there\nis a Mux Based ODN, wavelength assignment is done during the physical installation process.\n\n33\n\n\n\nIn an analogous process, during activation, a newly activated Tunable ONU may need to\ntune its wavelength by following a OLT command. Furthermore, an OLT should be able to\nconfirm ONU wavelength assignment in the MAC Layer, thus ONU wavelength are determined\nby physical infrastructure, and the TWDM and PtP WDM-PONs should inventory all working\nwavelengths.\n\nIn a process of wavelength assignment or tunning it is necessary for the OLT to synchronize\nwith the downstream signal, to carry out ONU identification, and to adapt to the multiplexing\ntechnique present in the specified network. The procedures for wavelength assignment and\ntunning in multiple-wavelength PONs as defined in ITU-T recommendation G.9802 are as\nfollows, figure 3.6:\n\n1. Comunication on wavelength tuning capability\n\n2. Wavelength assignment decision\n\n3. OLT commands ONU of the downstream/upstream wavelength to be assigned\n\n4. ONU wavelength adjustment\n\n5. ONU response\n\nONU tunablility information: transmitter or receiver tunning range, tunning gran-\nularity, tunning time, channel spacing, calibrated or uncalibrated transmitter type. There\nare several ways that an OLT can issue a wavelength management and control message to\nan ONU, either by broadcasting to all downstream wavelengths or emit it in the downstream\nwavelength of the new ONU. The information elements in such type of message include:\nupstream and downstream wavelength ID, destination wavelength in nanometers or the cor-\nresponding frequency, wavelength tunning direction, wavelength tunning start time.\n\nFigure 3.6: Wavlength assignment/tunning message exchange between OLT and ONU [53]\n\n34\n\n\n\n3.9.2 ONU Activation Process\n\nThe Process of bring an ONU into operation dwells with a certain number of factors.\nThe tunable transmitter used as the ONU Tx characteristics plays an important role in\ncarrying out an ONU activation, while having a calibrated ONU with sufficient accuracy\nmight not bring any constrains in the ONU activation, and the process can be carried out\nwith a straightforward downstream message from the OLT, issuing the desired channel in\nwhich the ONU will transmit. The process of activating an uncalibrated ONU might prove\nmore difficut, requiring additional tuning mechanisms. The latter scenario shall have to deal\nwith the additional constrains:\n\n\u2022 Wavelength laser at the start is unknown\n\n\u2022 New ONU activation must not interfere with traffic\n\n\u2022 Several ONU may attempt an activation on the PON at the same time\n\nWe will start by describing the ONU activation process carried out in TDM-PON [10] in\norder to introduce the TWDM-PON ONU activation since there are mechanisms that will\nremain from the Legacy PONs.\n\nAt the start up an ONU is not synchronized with other ONUs, any transmission would\nbe likely to disrupt regular data traffic. In order to deal with this problem, the OLT creates\na quite window at regular intervals, during this time ONUs in service are not allowed to send\nupstream data. During this time the OLT broadcasts a raging request at the start of the quite\nwindow. In response to the broadcast signal, any new ONU in the PON recently powered up\nwill respond with a short message in order to identify itself which will be its serial number.\nThe quite window is at least as long as the maximum round trip in the PON, and after the\nreception of the ONU\u2019s serial number, the OLT is able to measure the real round trip time of\nthe ONU requesting activation. An equalization delay is calculated based on the difference\nbetween the maximum possible round trip and the real round trip. The Serial number of the\nONU is store on the OLT management system, and assigns a new ONU-identifier (ONU-ID),\nwhich is used for target physical layer process. In response to the ONU serial number message,\nthe OLT will answer a message containing the ONU-ID and the equalization delay, thus the\nnewly activated ONU will be on the same reference timeframe as the other ONUs, allowing\nthe allocation of different time slots within that frame to prevent packets from colliding at\nthe OLT.\n\nIn TWDM-PON scenario where the ONU Tx is not sufficiently calibrated in wavelength,\ntransmission of the upstream discovery burst could occur in any upstream channel. It is\nthen necessary that the OLT open the quite window simultaneously in all channels to avoid\ninterference until a correct setting of the upstream wavelength is confirmed. Assuming that\nduring the quite window, one of the OLT burst-mode receivers reads the serial number of\nan ONU pending activation, similarly to TDM-PON, the OLT would send and ONU-ID and\nequalization delay signaling the recognition of the serial number. Furthermore, a coarse\ntuning mechanism can be initiated, with the intent of steering the ONU Tx wavelength\ninto another wavelength channel, even though we are assuming the use of an uncalibrated\nTx, relative changes can be controlled in a reproducible way. The fine tuning process\nwould then take place, in order to find the best tuning point for the ONU Tx, which would\nmean steering the wavelength to the maximum of the pass-band of the channel, typically\n\n35\n\n\n\nthe channel center. The fine-tuning mechanism is further explained in the section regarding\nwavelength locking.\n\nHowever, if the OLT can\u2019t read the ONU\u2019s serial number because the ONU Tx starting\nwavelength is in a point where the SNR is insufficient to perform such measure. A first acti-\nvation attempt from the ONU in the quit window would not receive a confirmation the OLT\nin the form of the ONU-ID and equalization delay. Therefore the ONU would, autonomously,\nshift its wavelength by a fraction of the of the channel spacing before and additional attempt\nin the next quite window. Note that this approach allows multiple ONUs attempting activa-\ntion at the same time, simply because an unanswered request would trigger and autonomously\nwavelength shift and a subsequently attempt.\n\n3.9.3 Tunning Time Classes\n\nThree classes for the wavelength channels tunning time were specified for NG-PON2 and\nas shown in table 3.9,\n\nTable 3.9: Wavelength channel tuning time classes for NG-PON2 [47]\n\nTuning Time Class Tuning Time\n\nClass 1&lt;10\u00b5s\nClass 2 10\u00b5s to 25ms\nClass 3 25ms to 1s\n\nDevices falling into each of these three classes, open up multiple cases for wavelength\ntunability,e.g., dynamic wavelength assignment [54], advanced power saving [55], and channel-\nbased protection mechanisms [48] that may require different tuning speeds.\n\nClass 3, the tunable devices, characterized with the longest tuning time, could be ther-\nmally tuned DFBs. These devices are suited for applications that require infrequent tuning\noperations, or if short service interrupt is allowed. Furthermore, channel-based protection\nmechanisms can be adopted, but a typical sub-50 ms protection objective may not be achieved.\nSemi-static load sharing and power saving mechanisms may be of interest.\n\nClass 2 components may be based on electronically tuned lasers (2sec. DBR), these a\nallow a faster channel switching and features such as sub-50 ms protection becomes possible,\nas well as dynamic load sharing and dynamic power saving.\n\nClass 1 devices, characterized by the fastest tuning time, may include switched lasers,\nfilter arrays or 3sec. DBR. Using this kind of tunable lasers may enable future dynamic\nwavelength and bandwidth allocation feature, and possible allow wavelength hopping between\nthe transmission periods.\n\nTuning Time\n\nThe tuning time of an ONU, as shown in figure 3.7, does not begin when the laser begins\nto tune but when the laser exists the passband of the original wavelength, i.e, when the\noptical power drops of 0.5 dB compared to the initial value, after the change command issued\nby the OLT. Analogously the tunning time ends when the lasers enters the passband of the\ndestination wavelength channel, i.e, when the optical power, in the destination wavelength,\nreaches and stays within the 0.5 dB of the initial (original channel) value. [47]\n\n36\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Laser tunning across the operating band [47]\n\n3.9.4 Maximum Spectral Excursion (MSE)\n\nMSE is specified as one-sided deviation from the nominal central frequency/wavelength,\nit is expressed in Gigahertz and it is illustrated in figure 3.8. MSE is a specified for to main\nreasons: first, to prevent optical power to leak from a wavelength channel to an adjacent\nwavelength channel, and second to endure that the transmitter operate within the desired\nWM channel passband.\n\nRegarding tuning transmitters, the maximum spectral excursion requirement is only ap-\nplied when those are in a stationary wavelength channel. Furthermore the referred require-\nment applies to both tunable transmitters which are under fine control of the OLT and tunable\ntransmitters which are not under fine OLT control.\n\nIn the application to NG-PON2, MSE is the total allowable excursion due to:\n\n\u2022 spectral width, tuning granularity, short-term wavelength drift (over one OLT-ONU\ntuning cycle) and tuning errors, when the ONU transmitters used are under fine OLT\ncontrol;\n\n\u2022 spectral width, tuning granularity and tuning accuracy, when the tunable transmitters\nused are not under fine OLT control.\n\nThe MSE values allowed for ONU transmitters in NG-PON2 systems are shown in table\n3.10, and they depend on the CS used in the system.\n\nTable 3.10: Maximum Spectral Excursion allowed in NG-PON2\n\nMaximum Spectal Excusion (Ghz) Channel Spacing (Ghz)\n\n12.5 50\n20 100\n25 200\n\nRegarding the OLT transmitter in a NG-PON2 system the channels have been specified\nwith a fixed channel spacing (CS) of 100Ghz, thus a \u00b120GHz of MSE is allowed.\n\n37\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: Illustration of the Maximum Spectral Excursion [47]\n\n3.9.5 Wavelength Control\n\nThe three key aspects pertinent to control of multiple wavelength in an NG-PON2 sys-\ntem, are: wavelength stability, wavelength accuracy and wavelength locking. The related\nwavelength control parameters, specified in [47], are also introduced.\n\n3.9.6 Wavelength Stability\n\nThe wavelength stability of an NG-PON2 system is quantified by the previously introduced\nparameter MSE.\n\nFor the TWDM-PON downstream, as referred before the channel spacing is fixed on the\n100 GHz and the MSE required is \u00b120 GHz, it is relatively simple for a tunable filter to\nfollow the maximum received power through a local feedback loop [56], therefore the ONU\nReceiver (Rx) filter does not require tight calibration.\n\nFor the upstream, the CS is not fixed, so three values of MSE were specified, Table 3.10,\nto each CS configuration. These MSE values were selected taking in consideration the need\nto avoid strictly requirements on wavelength calibration, in case where uncalibrated lasers\nare used, power variation over wavelength, tuning granularity, the loss and isolation of TFFs\nand AWGs and Tx spectral width [56]. Short-term spectral excursion caused by ONU laser\nswitching on/off at the burst boundaries must comply with MSE limit.\n\n3.9.7 Wavelength Accuracy\n\nThe wavelength accuracy, or the calibration accuracy of a Tunable ONU Tx refers to is\ncapability of transmitting with a allowable spectral excursion and stay within the specified\nlimits. There are three levels of calibration concerned to ONU tunable Tx defined in NG-\nPON2 standards: sufficient calibration, loose calibration and no calibration. Tunable ONU\nTx with sufficient calibration will have no problems regarding wavelength accuracy, but are\n\n38\n\n\n\nmore costly. On the other hand loosely calibrated and uncalibrated ONUs, although a more\nattractive solution in terms of cost, can not be guaranteed to operate within the the specified\nMSE limits without additional mechanisms that ensure some kind of wavelength locking.\n\n3.9.8 Wavelength Locking\n\nAs mentioned before, in downstream direction the ONU Rx can, by its own, look for\nthe highest received optical power, thus locking to the best tuning point. In the upstream\ndirection it may be more difficult for an ONU Tx wavelength locking relying on OLT feedback.\n\nAssuming that an OLT Rx can perform an accurate power, but not wavelength, measure-\nment, and that the ONU Tx launch power does not vary significantly for a small wavelength\nchange. A closed wavelength control loop can be realized between the OLT and the ONU in\norder to reach and a maintain the optimal tuning point of the ONU Tx.\n\nUnder OLT control, the ONU transmits ate different times, two sightly different wave-\nlengths (?+ ??) around the central wavelength ?. In the case that ? is coincident with the\nWM channel center, then the OLT Rx would detect no power variation between the two\ndifferent transmissions, thus no corrective action would be necessary. For the cases shown in\nFigure 3.9, the power change would revel both the magnitude and the sign of the wavelength\nmisalignment. In such outcome the OLT would then instruct the ONU top apply appropriate\ncorrections to rectify the tuning.\n\nIn order the previously explained closed loop method, which is described in [56] with\nmore detail, the WM may need to comply with additional constraints with respect to fil-\nter, bandwidth, monotonicity and passband ripple, outlined in the Appendix VII of G.989.2\nrecommendations. Two factors must be guaranteed: first, a mistuning of the ONU Tx is cor-\nrectly detected by the OLT power measurement, before MSE limit is exceeded. And second,\npower variations due to the WM filter shapes do not interfere negatively with the tuning.\nFurthermore a locking mechanism based on a BER measurement before the application on\nFEC, may be more convenient.\n\nFigure 3.9: Result for a mistuned ONU, a) Negative correction required, b) Positive correction\nrequired. [56]\n\n39\n\n\n\n3.9.9 OLT-port Protection\n\nA N:1 NG-PON2 fast protection by employing ONU wavelength tuning function was\ndemonstrated in [57]. One backup wavelength pair is preconfigured (e.g, the blue wavelength\npair figure 3.10) to protect traffic in other wavelength pairs if a failure is detected . The major\nsteps of the N:1 protection are presented in table 3.11. Advantages of the presented scheme\nare: Protection time is reduced by avoiding sending the involved ONUs back to re-registration,\nand ONU configurations of logic connections and service managements are reserved.\n\nFigure 3.10: N:1 Protection Architecture [57].\n\nTable 3.11: N:1 Protection Steps [57].\n\nStep 1\nOLT selects the backup\nwavelength pair.\n\nStep 2\n\nWhen a new ONU registers,\nthe OLT assigns a working\nwavelength pair, also\nconfigures it with the\nbackup pair.\n\nStep 3.a\n\nWhen the ONU detects a loss\nof signal, it enters a wavelength\ntuning state and tunes wavelength\nto the backup wavelength pair.\n\nStep 3.b\n\nWhen the OLT detects a loss of\nsignal of a wavelength pair, it\nswitches the traffic to the backup\nwavelength pair.\n\nStep 4\nThe OLT and ONU continue\ntraffic as soon as tuning ends.\n\n40\n\n\n\n3.9.10 OLT-port sleep and Load Balancing\n\nOLT-port sleep and load balancing are desirable functions in NG-PON2 systems, similarly\nto OLT-port protection, this function is provided by using the in service tuning capabilities\nof the NG-PON2 ONUs [55].\n\nWhen the traffic is sufficient low, some of the OLT-ports enter a sleep state in order to\nprovide power savings in the OLT, and decrease the OPEX. Figure 3.11(a) shows an example\nof the normal state of operation of an ONU. If it comes to a case when there is less traffic\nin a normal state operation of the OLT, figure 3.11(b), if the system uses the 4 wavelength\nchannels, by using in in-service tunning of ONUs, all ONUs are then connected to a single\nport (Port #1) and the other ports can be made to sleep, as shown in figure 3.11(c).\n\nRegarding the Load balancing, its an analogous process to OLT-port sleep. However it\ndeals with the situation when an OLT-port has heavy traffic congestion. If this is to happen,\nsome ONUs begin to communicate with other vacant ports, by changing their wavelength of\noperation.\n\nFigure 3.11: Exemple of OLT-port sleep. (a) Normal state (b) Normal state with less traffic\n(c) sleep state [49].\n\n41\n\n\n\n3.10 Externally Modulated Lasers versus Direct Modulated\nLasers for ONU Tx transceiver\n\nMaintaining the ONU Tx wavelength within the specified MSE values for upstream path\npresents several challenges. Further more for the 10 Gbit/s line rate.\n\nExternally Modulated Laser (EML) Tx are well developed regarding high transmission\ndata rates, over long fiber distances due to its low frequency chirp. Figure shows a EML Tx\nspectrum modulated at 10 Gbit/s. As can be observer the signal spectrum is about 14 GHz\nwide at -15 dB point, which means a single-side deviation of 7 GHz relative to the same point.\nIn a case where the chosen CS is 100 GHz for the upstream channels, the allowed MSE is\nof \u00b120 GHz, the accuracy to wich the the spectral peak of the ONU Tx must be controlled,\nand stay within the MSE, is then \u00b113 GHz. Such EML Tx is considered to be feasible with\nacceptable cost with known technology and techniques. [56]\n\nDirect Modulated Laser (DML) Tx face some problems when modulated at such hight\ndate rate such as 10 Gbit/s, due to modulation induced frequency shift, the signal spectrum\nwill broaden. Figure shows the DML spectrum and 2 distinct peaks can be observed, corre-\nsponding to the \u201d0\u201d and \u201d1\u201d logical levels respectively. The spectral with of the DML Tx is\nabout 35 GHz at the -15 dB point, meaning a single-side deviation of about 17.5 GHz and\nits wider that the EML case. Therefore the accuracy to which this Tx must be controlled in\norder to stay within the specified MSE is \u00b12,5 GHz. Such tight control is generally impossible\nwithout adding a precise, meaning costly, wavelength locker in the Tx.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 3.12: a) Optical spectrum of a 10 Gb/s EML Tx measured with a resolution bandwidth\nof 2.5 GHz. b)Gaussian-shaped filter and optical spectrum of a 10 Gb/s DML Tx measured\nwith a resolution bandwidth of 2 GHz and tuned to fit within MSE [56]\n\nFrom a transmission perspective, although DML is a good option for 2.5 Gbit/s upstream\ntransmissions, it might not be for the 10 Gbit/s transmission due to the chirp induced.\nNevertheless, several techniques have been developed [58, 59], in order to mitigate the chirp\ninduced frequency shift, thus relaxing the tight wavelength control difficulties in order to take\nadvantage of DML Tx\n\n42\n\n\n\n3.11 Wavelength Multiplexers (WM)\n\nAs extensively mentioned in previous sections, NG-PON2 systems employ WDM technol-\nogy, e.g., multiple wavelengths are combined into the same ODN. To this end, a WM is used in\nthe OLT to combine/split wavelengths for DS/US signals, respectively. The key components\nfor WM can be AWGs and TFFs.\n\nIn general, AWGs are widely deployed for a large number of channels (>80) with narrow\nCS of 100 GHz, or less. AWGs have cyclic property of multiple passband wavelengths in a\nsingle port, with the Free Spectral Range (FSR) designating the space between wavelengths.\n\nWMs using TFF are composed by a small number of individual filters in order to recreate\nthe desired properties of the WM, they offer a small number of channels, typically four. TFF\noffer some advantages compared with AWGs, such as lower insertion loss, high isolation, and\nlow cost when a small number of channels is needed. These advantages gradually fade away\nif the application requires a large number of channels\n\n3.11.1 Cyclic Characteristics of AWG\n\nThe cyclic properties of AWGs consists of multiple passband wavelengths in one single\nport. Specific implementations of TWDM-PON make use of this characteristic in order to\nprovide a low cost implementation, by allowing a wide variation in the US wavelength. [44,50]\n\nCyclic AWG designates an AWG with unique wavelength routing capabilities, this is\nillustrated in figure 3.13 . The referred AWG has 100 GHz CS, with enough channels to\ncover the C-band, used in US direction, in the wide option wavelength plan. Independently\nwhere the ONU Tx is tuned, it will be less that 50 GHz from the center of one of the AWG\nchannels, that will route the wavelengths to one of the four OLT CTs. The routing is shown\nwith different colors and repeats every 400 GHz. The employment of such device in a NG-\nPON2 system can translate into a low cost solution for the ONU Tx, by allowing the use\nof thermally tuned lasers with only a heating element, e.g., without the need for a TEC. To\nrealize such implementation is necessary that the tunable laser can tune to any of the desired\nCT, to so heater must able to change the laser die temperature by 35 ?C, meaning a tunning\nrange of approximately 2.6 nm. The main disadvantage of the mentioned scheme is that high\nroom temperatures fluctuations will require the laser to retune (jump 400GHz) in order to\nstay connected to the desired CT. If the tunning time of the laser is long, as it usually is with\nthermally tuned lasers, specially if high wavelength shift is needed such as 3.2 nm (400GHz),\nthen the service outage from periodic retuning might not be acceptable.\n\nFigure 3.13: Cyclic AWG US wavelength routing, the colors represent the four different\nCT. [56]\n\n43\n\n\n\n3.12 OLT Configuration Options\n\nIn this section three possible use cases for AWGs and TFFs usage as WM on the NG-PON2\nOLT are going to be presented.\n\nConfiguration I is composed by WM and transceivers that have single wavelength pair\nof US and DS signals. Configuration II contains a WDM filter, WMs, and transceivers that\nhave dual optical interface ports, one for DS, and another for US. Lastly, configuration III\nconsists of a WDM filter, WMs, a four channel Tx, and a four channel burst-mode Rx, figure\n3.14.\n\nConfig. I is characterized by having single input/output interface port, which is a common\nfeature of Legacy PONs, its main advantage is the use of a single WM that leads to a simple\nconfiguration. TFFs can not be used in this type of configuration. In config. II and III, both\nTFFs and AWGs are applicable. Configuration III is attractive because a small footprint can\nbe expected if four-channel integrated transceivers can be used, however it may not support\npay-as-you-grow. [56]\n\nFigure 3.14: Example of OLT configuration [56]\n\n3.13 Management and Control\n\nAuxiliary Management and Control Channel (AMCC) was added as one of the NG-PON2\nnew feature. The motivation for the AMCC lies with the integration of the PtP WDM\noverlay in the system. While, in terms of management and control, the TWDM-PON is an\nend-to-end specification of a complete system in layers 1 and 2, and it extends the protocol\nspecifications of Legacy PON systems. The PtP WDM is specified to transport client services\nwith minimal or no payload modification, therefore the AMCC is required in order to deal\nwith the management and control features of the PtP WDM Link. In short:\n\n\u2022 NG-PON2 supports a wide range of PtP WDM devices transparently, so a new channel\nis defined AMCC. [60]\n\n\u2022 AMCC is used for activation and control of the PtP WDM channels. Carries Physical\nLayer Operations, Administration and Maintenance (PLOAM) messages. [60]\n\n44\n\n\n\nThe process of activating new uncalibrated ONU was described in section 3.9.2, however\nwith the assumption that the OLT would simultaneously open a quite window in all channels.\nIf this is not feasible, e.g., because the channels belong to separate systems or independent\nnetwork operators or if the service in one channel can not be interrupted, a new approach\nmust be followed. The TWDM-PON can take advantage of an AMCC approach, a very low-\nlevel low frequency signal on which an ONU can communicate US during activation phase,\nwould be very useful on cases where the ONU cannot guarantee to start transmitting the\ncorrect wavelength. The ONU should transmit at a level low enough to not interfere with\nthe working channels but detectable by the OLT [60]. Information to be transmitted must\nbe minimal, e.g., serial number. Another advantage of such approach is that the detection of\nthe AMCC signal does not require synchrony of the different wavelength channels [56].\n\n3.14 Conclusion\n\nIn this chapter the NG-PON2 recommendation was discussed, it was started by presenting\nits general architecture, line rates and wavelength plan. NG-PON2 will not be a disruptive\nsolution, it allows coexistence with previous PONs, and will re-utilize the already deployed\ninfrastructure, if those exist. NG-PON2 will also feature attractive solutions for Green-field\napplications.\n\nOne of the requirements for NG-PON2 its the use of colorless transceivers, NG-PON2\nmay take advantage of the inherent tuning capabilities of such transceivers in order to allow\nin-service tuning functionalities.\n\nWhile for downstream transceivers cost will be shared across multiple subscribers, this\nis not the case for upstream transceivers. The need for low cost solutions for upstream\ndirection, mainly the ONU Tx, may push for the use of uncalibrated transmitters. Additional\ntuning mechanisms are then required in order to activate and deal with such ONUs. Some\nconsiderations are made regarding the use of DML, EML and cyclic AWGs.\n\nThe chapter is finalized with a reference to the AMCC, a control channel added manly to\nmanage and control the PtP WDM channels transparently, e.g., with no payload modifica-\ntion. Considerations are made regarding the use of the AMCC in TWDM-PON to facilitate\nuncalibrated ONU activation.\n\n45\n\n\n\n46\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nTunable Laser Testing\n\n4.1 Introduction\n\nTunable Distributed Feedback (DFB) with an integrated heater to perform tuning op-\neration are a low cost solution for an NG-PON2 ONU Tx. In this chapter a device of this\ntype is going to be characterized regrading the tunable aspects of operation. Tuning time is\nan important parameter of ONU Tx, it may limit the functionalities that an ONU provides.\nSpecially when such functions require and in-service tuning, furthermore ITU-T NG-PON\nrecommendation G.989.1 defines the service interruption time must be less than 50 ms in or-\nder to provide service continuation when and if ONUs are required to perform tuning. DFB\nlasers are known to a tuning time in the order of the sub-s, nevertheless, in this work tuning\ntime of a DFB laser designed by PICadvanced is going to be evaluated. Implementation of\nnetwork functions that require a tuning time in the order of \u00b5s to ms (such as: Load balanc-\ning, OLT-port protection and Power saving) are considered upon tuning time results. The\naccuracy of the tunable Tx is calculated as well.\n\n4.2 DFB Characteristics\n\nThe Laser utilized in the following setups is DFB, integrated in a photonic circuit. The\nstructure of a DFB laser was mentioned before, section 2.5.2, as well as the mechanism behind\nsuch device that allow a tunable operation in a narrow band. A conventional DFB laser\u2019s\nemission wavelength can be tuned by heating or cooling with a gradient of about 0.08 nm/K.\nThe DFB works in the C-band, the operating wavelength is centered around 1552 nm at\nroom temperature, and the laser has a tunning range of approximately 5 nm. This laser was\ndesign to operate in the NG-PON2 upstream direction, but due to a fabrication defect the\noperating wavelengths of the laser were shifted in 20 nm, as well as lower output optical power\nthan expected. Nevertheless it will serve as a proof-of-concept in order to study the tuning\nmechanisms behind its operation and relevant characteristics for its use in a NG-PON2 ONU,\nsuch as spectral characteristics, tunning time. The laser can be seen in picture 4.1 and the\nsetup utilized to characterize the laser can be seen in figure.\n\n47\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: DFB laser\n\nFigure 4.2: Setup used to characterize the DFB laser\n\nThe DFB laser has two control variables: bias current and temperature. Increasing bias\ncurrent leads to an increase in the output power, whereas the temperature is used to adjust\nthe laser to the desired wavelength. The laser as a fairly low output power, figure 4.3 and 4.4,\nalthough its threshold current is 20mA, it can be observed that for I bias bellow 60 mA the\nlaser as a significantly optical power drop. It can also be noted that the temperature does not\nhave a significantly influence on the output power trait. Furthermore, regarding the optical\noutput power of the laser, higher values could be measured by improving the fiber alignment\nwith the laser.\n\n48\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Wavelength and Optical Power vs I bias @ 25 ?C\n\nFigure 4.4: Wavelength and Optical Power vs I bias @ 40 ?C\n\n4.2.1 DFB Tuning\n\nA Thermo-Electric Cooler (TEC) is integrated with the system in order to maintain\na stable temperature of operation, while the tuning is enabled by a monolithic integrated\nheater. The lasing wavelength of the DFB laser is a product of three factors: I bias, I heater\nand the temperature set by the TEC. First the I bias used to drive the laser which has is own\nthermal effect withing the laser cavity, the influence of the I bias over the lasing wavelength\nof the laser can be seen in figure 4.5, the wavelength is plotted versus I bias for different\ntemperatures. Note that a 0.8 nm tuning range can be obtained by varying I bias, which,\nin a practical scenario where 100 GHz CS is chosen for the upstream direction, would mean\nthe necessary variation to switch to a different channel. Second, by injecting a current on\nthe integrated heater, which we will call I heater, a change on the refractive index of the\n\n49\n\n\n\ndistributed grating along the cavity is produced, therefore changing DFB\u2019s lasing wavelength.\nAnd third the operation temperature of the laser which can be controlled with the TEC.\nThe relationship of the lasing wavelength with I bias and the temperature is plotted in figure\n4.5, I tunning was set to 0, and the temperature was controlled with the TEC. While the\nrelationship between the wavelength and I heater can be seen in figure 4.6a at 25 ?C , and in\nfigure 4.6b at 40 ?C. Furthermore it can be seen that different I bias will result in a different\noptical output power. For I heater values greater than 70 mA can be noted a significant power\ndrop, still for values bellow 70 mA of I heater a tuning range above 2,4 nm can be maintained.\nMeasurements regarding the characterization of the DFB can be seen in Appendix A.\n\nFigure 4.5: Wavelength vs I bias vs @ room temperature, 35 ?C, 40 ?C and 50 ?C\n\n(a) Wavelength vs I heater @ 25 ?C (b) Wavelength vs I heater @ 40 ?C\n\n4.3 Tuning Time\n\nThe tuning time of a tunable Laser was defined in section 3.9.3, it refers to a time it\ntakes to a laser to exit the passband of the original channel and enter the passband of the\ndestination channel, note that tunning time thus defined is related only to the tunable optical\ndevice characteristics. Being impossible to measure this time difference in the optical domain,\n\n50\n\n\n\nit will be necessary to condition the optical signal in order to analyze the time it takes to\nchange from one wavelength channel to another in the electric domain. In the further sections\nwe will refer to the wavelength with lower value and to the wavelength with higher value the\nas ?1, and ?2 respectively. Furthermore, since the utilized laser is a DFB, a change from ?1\nto ?2 requires heating, on the contrary, a change from ?2 to ?1 requires cooling, therefore\nthe time it takes the laser to change from ?1 to ?2 will be defined as theat, on the contrary a\nchange from ?2 to ?1 will be defined with tcool. The method utilized for this end, as well as\nthe obtained results will be presented in the following sections.\n\n4.3.1 Setup\n\nThe Setup utilized to measure tuning time is shown in figure 4.7 (top), and is based on\nan example from G.989.2 Appendix VIII.\n\nFigure 4.7: Tunning Time measurement setup (top), Expected Results (bottom)\n\nThe tunning signal used in the setup refers to I heater, and the applied signal was a\ncontinuous pulse signal, the objective was to make the laser change from ?1 to ?2, and vice\nversa, multiple times, with the purpose to measure the theat and tcool.\n\nThe EDFA\u2019s and the waveshaper in the apparatus are used with the intent of boosting\nthe signal\u2019s power, since the laser only debits a power around -45 to -50 dBm, without them\nit would be difficult to differentiate, in the electric domain, the actual signal from the noise.\n\nThe necessity to modulate the signal lies within the fact that the used scope blocks the\nDC component of the input signals, therefore a MZM is used to this end, otherwise, it would\nbe impossible to watch the electric signal corresponding to the optical signal when using the\nlaser in a CW operation.\n\nThe AWG used in the setup is set according to the 100 GHz ITU grid, and as two main\nfunctions. First acts as a wavelength splitter and enables the visualization of ?1 and ?2 in two\ndifferent channels. Second, acts as filter, providing isolation for ?1 and ?2 and thus assuring\n\n51\n\n\n\nthat the measurements taken are effectively relative to a change from ?1 to ?2 and vice versa.\nAt last we have two similar APD\u2019s, that convert the optical signal into electric domain to be\nfurther visualized in the oscilloscope, and thus observe the time relationship between ?1 and\n?2. In short, the method is based on the observation of a power variation through a reference\nWavelength Multiplexer (AWG), when the DFB laser tunes from wavelength to another.\n\n4.3.2 Methodology\n\nConsidering that the DFB under test is to be used on a NG-PON2 ONU, 4 wavelength\nchannels are going to be considered with a 100 GHz channel spacing, thus 3 different scenarios\nare going to be further studied, figure 4.8. Also ?1 will always be considered as the lasing\nwavelength of the DFB without I heater.\n\nFigure 4.8: Different scenarios for a change from ?1 yellow to ?2 green\n\nIn a first approach to tuning time measurement, a uncooled scenario was studied, i.e., the\nTEC was not turned on, and all measurements were made at room temperature.\n\nThis experiment can be essentially divided in three steps:\n\n1. Check ?1, on a Optical Spectrum Analyzer (OSA), apply I heater, and check ?2, I bias\nand I heater are set accordingly so that both ?1 and ?2 fall withing the passband of\ntwo different AWG channels, figure 4.7(1, bottom).\n\n2. Adjust the waveshaper to ?1 and ?2, and check the optical signal after the AWG to be\nsure that the lasing wavelengths is effectively going throw the AWG, a 50/50 coupler\nwas used in order to check both channels simultaneously 4.7(bottom, 3&amp;4).\n\n3. Check ?1 and ?2 on the oscilloscope, figure 4.9, and measure theat and tcool.\n\nThe control signal utilized has a rise and fall time of 500 ns which is irrelevant on the\ntuning time scale for the DFB. On further notice, its clearly visible, figure 4.9, when the tuning\ntime starts, as for when it ends, measurements where made on the point where the destination\nwavelength reaches its maximum output power. The three enumerated steps were thoroughly\nrepeated for the different scenarios shown in 4.8. All measurements taken regarding the cases\n\n52\n\n\n\npresented can be seen in Appendix B. To note that we are using a Flat-top AWG with a 100\nGHz bandwidth in the setup, which means that ?1 and ?2 are not necessarily aligned with\nthe AWG channel center. When performing a tunning time measurement, the tuning time\nends when the the lasing wavelength enters the passband of the destination channel which\ndoes not necessarily coincide with the final ?2.\n\nFigure 4.9: Oscilloscope picture of ?1 yellow, and ?2 green, 20 ms/div\n\n4.3.3 Results\n\nScenario 1\n\nScenario 1 refers to a tuning time from the first NG-PON2 wavelength channel (lowest ?)\nto the forth NG-PON2 wavelength channel (highest ?). In a practical sense, regarding the\nlaser, this would mean a frequency shift around 300 GHz, or 2.4 nm, if the CS used is 100\nGHz, which we will consider for all scenarios. The measurements for this scenario comprehend\nwavelength shifts in the order of 2.21 nm to 2.53 nm, which translate into 274.8 GHz to 314,1\nGHz. The measured tuning time is plotted versus I bias and ?? in figure4.10a and 4.10b,\nrespectively. theat presents a mean value of 44.8 ms, with a standard deviation of 14.1 ms.\nWhile tcool presents a mean value of 42.6 ms, with a standard deviation of 16 ms. Since the\nDFB laser is tuned by temperature, heating or cooling, which is a gradual process, higher\nwavelength shifts will require a higher tuning time, therefore we will analyze the tuning time\nper GHz in a further section.\n\n53\n\n\n\n(a) Tuning time versus I bias (b) Tuning time versus ??\n\nTable 4.1: Tuning time summary Scenario 1\n\nAverage Std.

This would mean a frequency shift of 200 GHz, 1,6 nm, the measurements\nmade for this scenario comprehend wavelength shifts in the order of 1.26 nm to 1.83 nm,\nthat correspond to 156.6 GHz and 227.5 GHz. The average tuning time measured for theat\nis 33.3 ms with a deviation of 9 ms, tcool presents a mean value of 26.2 ms with a deviation\nof 4 ms. The measured tuning time is plotted versus I bias and ?? in figure4.11a and 4.11b\nrespectively.\n\n(a) Tuning time versus I bias (b) Tuning time versus ??\n\n54\n\n\n\nTable 4.2: Tuning time summary Scenario 2\n\nAverage Std.

The measurements\ntaken for this scenario correspond to wavelength shifts in the order of 0.71 nm to 1.01 nm,\nwhich translate into 88.3 GHz to 125.6 GHz frequency shifts.The measured tuning time is\nplotted versus I bias and ?? in figure4.12a and 4.12b respectively. The tuning time average\nfor theat is 18.65 ms with a deviation of 5.2 ms, as for tcool the mean value measured was 13.2\nms with a deviation of 4.8 ms.\n\n(a) Tuning time versus I bias (b) Tuning time versus ??\n\nTable 4.3: Tuning time summary Scenario 3\n\nAverage Std.

Figures 4.14 and 4.15 shown an histogram, with a bell curve, for theat/GHz\nand tcool/GHz. The average value for theat/GHz is 0.172 and for tcool/GHz is 0.142, and the\nrespective standard deviations are 0.049 an 0.042 ms/GHz.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 4.13: (a)theat and (b) tcool ms/GHz plotted with mean value and mean value \u00b1 stan-\ndard deviation.\n\nFigure 4.14: theat/GHz histogram and normal distribution\n\n56\n\n\n\nFigure 4.15: tcool/GHz histogram and normal distribution\n\nAnalyzing the results of the tuning time measurements it can be seen high variance in\nthe results, nonetheless it can also be seen that I bias has no influence on the tuning time.\nThe high divergence in the tuning time results can be caused by two factors: First the use of\nthe waveshaper in the setup, because of the laser\u2019s low output power, which has a thinning\neffect on the pass-band of the original and destination channel. And second, the TEC was\nturned off, and measurements were made at room temperature. Few measurements were\nmade with the TEC turned on and stabilized at 25 ?C, due to a technical problem, results are\nsummarized in table 4.4, Scenario 1,2 and 3 where evaluated to I bias= 80 and 90 mA. The\naverage value is slightly lower, and the standard deviation presents half of the value. To note\nthe particular measurement, figure 4.4, referent to a wavelength change from 1552.247 nm to\n1555.014 nm, meaning a 344 Ghz frequency shift. The elapsed time for heating and colling is\n38.2 and 30.8 ms respectively.\n\nWe can conclude that the longest tuning time for the Tx is at maximum 27, 43 and 96 ms\nfor 100, 200 and 300 GHz frequency shifts. Nevertheless by analyzing figure 4.14 and 4.15 it\ncan be seen that 68,2% of the measurements point to a 0.12 to 0.21 ms/GHz heating time,\nand a 0.09 to 0.20 ms/GHz cooling time.\n\nTable 4.4: theat/GHz and tcool/GHz measurements with TEC\n\nAverage Std. Deviation Max Min\n\ntheat/GHz (ms/GHz) 0,1594 0,0213 0,1823 0,1111\n\ntcool/GHz (ms/GHz) 0,1380 0,0233 0,1624 0,0896\n\n57\n\n\n\nFigure 4.16: Tuning time measurement, 20 ms/div\n\n4.4 Tuning Accuracy\n\nTuning accuracy of an ONU Tx is related to two factors: Single-Side Spectral Width\n(SSW) at -15 dB point, and MSE allowed imposed by Channel Spacing (CS) for Upstream\n(US) direction. SSW at -15 dB point was measured and found to be 0,038 nm, figure 4.17,\nwhich would mean around 5 GHz in terms of frequency. The specified MSE for 100 GHz US\nCS is \u00b120 GHz, so the accuracy to which the central peak of DFB laser must be controlled,\nand stay within the MSE, is then \u00b115 GHz. To note that the laser was externally modulated\nat 2.5 Gbit/s using a MZM. Direct modulation was not studied for this laser mainly because\nof the low output power, nevertheless using direct modulation in burst mode for this kind of\nTx, would probably make it exceed the MSE values allowed.\n\nIn a case where CS for the US is 50 GHz, thus an MSE allowed of 12.5 GHz, the DFB\nwould have to be controlled with an accuracy of \u00b17.5 GHz in order to stay withing the\nspecified MSE.\n\nFigure 4.18 shows the relationship between I heater and the frequency shift produced,\nthe red dashed vertical lines mark the \u00b115GHz around the channel center, whereas the blue\ndashed vertical lines mark the \u00b17,5 GHz. Assuming that for the laser to tune in the first\nwavelength channel (?1, blue for 50 GHz CS, red for 100 GHz CS) a 50 GHz shift would\nbe needed, it can be seen that the laser can be controlled accurately by I heater, in order\nto tune to one of the other three wavelengths channels (?2,?3 or ?4) and stay within it,\nwithout exceeding the MSE limits, for both 50 and 100 GHz. In a practical scenario, the\nfirst wavelength channel would be set ideally with I heater=0, being that the temperature\nstabilized by the TEC would define the US wavelength.\n\n58\n\n\n\nFigure 4.17: Optical Spectrum of the DFB, externally modulated at 2.5 Gbit/s, and measured\nwith 33 pm accuracy.\n\nFigure 4.18: Relationship between I heater and frequency shift @ 25 ?C.\n\n4.5 Tuning Mechanisms\n\nThe characterized DFB laser, operating in conjunction with a TEC, can be considered\na loose calibrated Tx. By maintaining the temperature of operation constant, the lasing\n\n59\n\n\n\nwavelength can be controlled by a stepped I heater, with sufficient accuracy, in order to,\nchange and stay within a desired wavelength channel, in short the ONU equipped with such\ntransceiver would be capable of performing a coarse tuning mechanism autonomously.\nNonetheless, such transmitter will not be able to tune its wavelength to the best tuning point\non the wavelength channel, requiring an additional fine tuning mechanism, such as the\none described in the previous chapter under section 3.9.8.\n\nOLT-port Protection\n\nThe OLT-port protection presented in section 3.9.9 provides a fast solution for wavelength\nassignment in case of an OLT-port failure. The main feature of the referred tuning mechanism\nrelies on a preconfiguration of a backup wavelength pair. In a case where the ONU Tx is\ncharacterized by a long tuning time, such as the transmitter under study, a good approach\nwould be configuring the backup wavelength pair in an adjacent channel. If an OLT-port were\nto failure, the ONU would tune to the backup wavelength pair with a tunning time under\n30 ms, nonetheless before resuming normal operation, the fine tuning mechanism previously\nmentioned would be necessary, to find the best tuning point for the ONU Tx. Regardless, the\nservice interruption time would be less than the 50 ms defined in the ITU-T Recommendation\nG.989.1 [5]. For this purpose the OLT would not need to inventory the back up wavelength\npair of each ONU, but just a flag signaling the direction of the adjacent wavelength channel\npair which would serve as back up.\n\nPower Saving\n\nIn a case where the low traffic on the PON justifies a sleep operation mode for one or more\nOLT-ports, and some of the ONUs are required to tune their wavelength to another OLT-\nport. The ONU featuring the presented DFB Tx would be capable of such operation under\n50 ms if two conditions are meet. First the OLT should always have two ports in constant\nand normal operation. Second the ONUs required to re-tune their wavelengths, would do so,\nbut to one of the adjacent channels, in order to meet the requirements of maximum tuning\ntime allowed. Also, by making the OLT port #2 and #4 enter in sleep mode, ONUs would\nrequire to tune their wavelengths to port #1 and #3 (port #1 is the lowest wavelength, and\nport #4 is the highest), thus the Tx would require cooling to tune and take advantage of the\nshortest tuning time presented by the tunable DFB.\n\nLoad Balancing\n\nAn NG-PON2 ONU equipped with a Tx similar to the one presented in this chapter\nmight support a semi-static load balancing functionality, with a in-service tuning capability\nthat would not exceed the 50 ms. This network function could be achieved in an analogous\nway as the previously presented function. By ensuring that the ONU Tx would retune its\nwavelength to one of the adjacent channels.\n\nNote that, in NG-PON2 Configuration where 50 GHz is used in US channel spacing the\ntuning time of the DFB laser can be drastically reduced, making it even more feasible the\navailability of the aforementioned network functionalities on the NG-PON2 ONU.\n\n60\n\n\n\n4.6 Further Considerations\n\nIntegrating a temperature sensor in the laser would enable its use on a NG-PON2 ONU,\nwithout the need for the TEC, in a case where a cyclic AWG is used, section 3.11.1. Such\napproach was described and studied in [50]. The DFB laser with an integrated heater and\ntemperature sensor, would provide a lower cost solution than the DFB laser previously pre-\nsented. Its operating wavelength could be maintained with a feedback control loop, using\nI heater as a control signal, while the temperature sensor provides the needed feedback. Us-\ning such a type of Tx in ONU would be classified as an uncalibrated ONU. The tuning\nmechanism required for such approach are slightly different, the process of activation of un-\ncalibrated ONU was described in section 3.9.2, so were the process of coarse and fine-tuning.\nAn additional tuning mechanism must feature this kind of ONU Tx, and its related with the\npossibility of I heater reaching its thresholds. Since there is not a TEC in order to stabilize\nthe temperature of operation, temperature fluctuations might require the laser to retune its\nwavelength over 400Ghz to stay within the same channel termination.\n\n61\n\n\n\n62\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nConclusions and Future Work\n\n5.1 Conclusions\n\nThis work as been presented on a set of 5 chapters, The first chapter included context,\nmotivation, structure, objectives and the main contributions.\n\nSecond chapter features a state of the art regarding PON in access and legacy PONs. As\nwell as a short review on colorless receivers and transmitters.\n\nThe third chapter presents an extensive overview on NG-PON2 system, which is the first\nstandardized PON system to feature a multi-wavelength over the same ODN. Although harder\nto implement, this translates in the main advantage of NG-PON2, its spectral flexibility and\nwavelength agility. In order to provide a smooth transition from Legacy PONs, coexistence is\nenabled. The wavelength plan defined for NG-PON2 specifies three US options for TWDM-\nPON in order to provide relaxation regarding the ONU Tx control, furthermore since PtP\nWDM will be able to exploit unused wavelength bands, NG-PON2 will make efficient use of\nthe spectrum.\n\nThe support for multiple ODN configurations (WS-ODN, WR-ODN and Hybrid ODN)\ncan meet various operator and application needs, either for a deployment with need for\ncoexistence or a green-field scenario, or a deployment in dense urban areas or rural areas.\n\nTuning mechanisms are addressed in order to deal with, calibrated, loosely calibrated\nand uncalibrated ONU. Calibrated ONUs do not need particular attention, loosely calibrated\nONUs can perform a coarse tuning mechanism autonomously and uncalibrated ONUs are\nrequired to be under OLT fine control, either for coarse or fine tuning.\n\nRegarding the choice for the tunable Tx for the OLT and ONU, a number of factors have\nto be taken into account, such as, tuning time, spectral excursion, tuning accuracy, as well if\nthey can be directly modulated at the specified line rates or if external modulation is needed.\n\nFor the ONU tunable Tx, th choice depends on three factors, US wavelength plan, channel\nspacing and line rate. Wavelength plan and CS relate to the spectral and tuning characteristics\nof the laser. Using the wide wavelength plan option, in conjunction with an cyclic AWG allows\ntransmitter to drift in wavelength over a wide range. Higher values of MSE allowed can enable\nthe use of loose calibrated ONU, thus low-cost solutions as ONU Tx. While for lower values\nof MSE might require the use of calibrated Tx or ensure mechanisms of wavelength locking.\nThe line rate might influence the choice for the tunable ONU Tx, DML are well developed\nwhen it comes to 2,5 Gbit/s data rate, which is not the case for 10 Gbit/s.\n\n63\n\n\n\nRegarding Chapter 4, the tunable transmitter under study, aligned with an external mod-\nulator (which can be monolithically integrated) and a TEC, might prove to be a low cost\nsolution for an NG-PON2 TWDM-PON ONU. Tuning mechanisms are addressed in order to\nactivate and tune loosely calibrated ONUs on the PON, which is the category at which the\ntunable DFB belongs. Tunable accuracy is deduced, and the Tx can be used in two config-\nurations of US channel spacing, 50 and 100 GHz, although the former might easily enable\nnetwork functions requiring tuning times of \u00b5s to ms order.\n\n5.2 Future Work\n\nThe first proposal is to develop a controller for the studied transceiver in order to realize\nits implementation on a real ONU, with the release of ITU recommendation G.989.3 PLOAM\nmessages were upgrade to deal with tuning performed by ONUs, so the main goal for such\ncontroller is to perform coarse tuning autonomously if issued by the OLT, and to deal with\nthe OLT instructions in order to perform fine-tuning.\n\nSecond proposal, and still related to the former, is to extend the research on tunable re-\nceivers in order to find one that fits the tuning time characteristics of the DFB laser presented\nin this work, in order to build matched ONU in terms of tuning, that provides both a low\ncost solution and with some of the desirable network functions that require in-service tuning.\n\nFigure 5.1: Proposed setup to measure tuning time of a tunable filter\n\n64\n\n\n\nAppendices\n\n65\n\n\n\nAppendix A\n\nLaser Characterization\n\nTable A.1: ?
