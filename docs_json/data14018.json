FORMOSO*\n\nABSTRACT\n\nA geochemical modeling of gold deposition was performed using the EQ3/EQ6 software package using\n\nconditions inferred from geological, petrographic, geochemical and fluid inclusion data from the Bloco do\n\nButi\u00e1 gold mine, Lavras do Sul, RS. Gold in the mine occurs only in the pyrite structure (invisible gold).\n\nThe pyrite occurs associated with white mica (phengite) in the zone of phyllic alteration. The process of\n\ngold deposition showed to be related to temperature and pH decrease. The pH decrease was fundamental to\n\ngold deposition by destabilization of sulfur species [Au(HS)?2 , HAu(HS)\n0\n2 and Au(HS)\n\n0] dissolved in the\n\naqueous solution, being Au(HS)0 the main gold transporting complex. The addition of KCl is hard to accept\n\nas cause of gold precipitation because no Cl\u2013 was detected in phengite. However, the geochemical mass\n\nbalance calculation resulted in the gain of some potassium in the zone of phyllic alteration. The precipitation\n\nof pyrite (\u00b1 auriferous) may have been strongly influenced by iron availability resulting from dissolution\nof ferrous chlorites by the fluids responsible for phengite deposition. The low salinity in quartz grain fluid\n\ninclusions from the propylitized wall rock also indicates the little importance of chlorine as gold transporting\n\nagent. Sulfur, and not chlorine, compounds must have dominated the gold transporting complexes in the\n\nBloco do Buti\u00e1 gold area.\n\nKey words: geochemical modeling, gold, pyrite, sulfur, fluid-rock interaction.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nStudies on gold solubility and deposition have been\n\nconducted by several authors (e.g. Schenberger and\n\nBarnes 1989, Hayashi and Ohmoto 1991, Gibert et\n\nal. 1998) because of the importance of their appli-\n\ncation in geological exploration.\n\nThis study reports the numerical results of a\n\n*Member, Academia Brasileira Ci\u00eancias\nCorrespondence to: Andr\u00e9 Sampaio Mexias\nE-mail: andre.mexias@ufrgs.br\n\nsimulated interaction of the mineral reactions be-\n\ntween a fluid and the rock with gold solubility. The\n\naim is to relate theoretical and natural conditions of\n\ngold deposition in the Bloco do Buti\u00e1 gold mine.\n\nThe mineral deposits in the Lavras do Sul re-\n\ngion are hosted by Neoproterozoic granitic rocks\n\nfrom the Lavras do Sul Intrusive Complex (Gastal\n\nand Lafon 1998) and by volcanogenic rocks from\n\nthe Hil\u00e1rio Formation. The former comprise a cen-\n\ntral granodiorite facies, partly assimilated by alka-\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2005) 77 (4)\n\n\n\n718 ANDR\u00c9 SAMPAIO MEXIAS ET AL.\n\nline magma (perthite granite \u2013 border facies) that\n\ngenerated hybrid rocks (sieno and monzogranites \u2013\n\ntransitional facies), while the latter is formed mainly\n\nby basic to intermediate volcanogenic rocks. The\n\nBloco do Buti\u00e1 area is located in the perthite granite\n\nfacies occurring at the western border of the granitic\n\ncomplex (Fig. 1).\n\nThe hydrothermal alteration and mineraliza-\n\ntion occur along one hundred meters long fractures\n\n(EW to N70?W, dipping to N in high angle), forming\ncentimetric to metric alteration haloes. According\n\nto petrographic observations (Mexias et al. 2002,\n\n2004), the hydrothermal alteration began with epi-\n\nsyenite formation associated with the leaching of\n\nhigh volumes of silica through faults and fractures.\n\nThe quartz is dissolved forming vugs, increasing\n\nrock permeability and porosity. The amphibole\n\nchanges into ferrous chlorite, which partially pre-\n\ncipitates in these vugs. A stage of phyllic alteration,\n\ncharacterized by neutral to acid fluids and which\n\npromoted phengite + pyrite (and gold) precipitation,\n\noccurred later in the vugs left by the dissolution of\n\nquartz and also promoted the partial dissolution of\n\nthe previous crystallized iron-rich chlorite. Gold\n\nconcentrations in the phyllic altered rock are around\n\n1 ppm and are mainly represented as \u2018 \u2018 invisible\u2019 \u2019\n\ngold in pyrite grains. Propylitization is observed as\n\na widespread alteration, characterized by the isovol-\n\numetric chloritization of amphibole in the rocks that\n\nenvelope these highly previous altered and miner-\n\nalized portions of rock. Weathering processes may\n\nhave been responsible for a secondary concentra-\n\ntion of gold, stimulated by the easy degradation of\n\nthis porous and permeable, previously altered and\n\nphyllosilicate-rich rock.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nGammons and Williams-Jones (1997), when study-\n\ning the gold mobility in porphyry-epithermal sys-\n\ntems, observed that at very high temperatures\n\n(? 500?C) gold is dissolved mainly as AuCl?2 com-\nplexes showing that its solubility decreases con-\n\nstantly with cooling. At lower temperatures, the\n\nauthors demonstrated that the dominant complexes\n\nchange mainly to Au(HS)?2 . They stress that the\ntransition temperature of the chloride-bissulphite\n\ncomplexes as main gold transport agents depends\n\non pH and on the H2S/Cl ratio of the original fluid,\n\nas well as the occurrence or not of boiling in the\n\nhydrothermal system.\n\nIn our study, assumptions on the factors that\n\ncan control the gold deposition were tested by using\n\nthe EQ3/6 software package (Wolery 1983, Wolery\n\nand Daveler 1992).\n\nEQ3 performs the chemical speciation of an\n\naqueous solution. It distributes each element of\n\nthe solution in stable aqueous species, calculates\n\nthe activity coefficients of water and of the aqueous\n\nspecies, the gas fugacity, and calculates the satura-\n\ntion index of the solution with respect to all phases\n\nconsidered in the database. EQ6 models the mass\n\ntransfer in a solid-solution-gas system. It approxi-\n\nmates irreversible reactions by a succession of small\n\nreaction steps. At each step it reacts small amounts\n\nof reactants (minerals, aqueous species, or gas), cal-\n\nculates the new composition of the solution, the fu-\n\ngacity of gases, and models the precipitation condi-\n\ntions of over-saturations.\n\nThree kinds of quantitative information can be\n\ngenerated:\n\n\u2013 The chemical force, which drives a given reac-\n\ntion (Gibbs Free Energy of the system);\n\n\u2013 The nature of the stable paragenesis as a func-\n\ntion of the temperature and chemical parame-\n\nters;\n\n\u2013 The time required to reach thermodynamic\n\nequilibrium as a function of the specified ki-\n\nnetic laws.\n\nMODELING PROCEDURES\n\nGeneral characteristics of the theoretical\n\nexperiment\n\nThe following topics summarize the assumed gen-\n\neral characteristics of the theoretical experiment:\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2005) 77 (4)\n\n\n\nGEOCHEMICAL MODELING OF GOLD PRECIPITATION 719\n\nCamba\u00ed Complex\n\nFazenda do Posto granodiorite\n\nperthite granites\n\nmonzogranites to granodiorites\n\nquartz monzonites\n\nmonzonites\n\nArroio do Jacques monzodiorite\n\nsieno- to monzogranites\nsedimentary sequence\nMaric\u00e1 Allogroup\n\nvolcanogenic sequence\n(Hil\u00e1rio Formation)\n\nJaguari granite\n\nsecondary roads\n\nbasic dikes\n\ngeological contact\n\ninferred geological contact\n\nprincipal road (RS-11)\n\nLavras do Sul\n\nBloco do Buti\u00e1 Area\n\nBrazil\n\nSul-rio-grandense\nShield\n\nEncruzilhada\ndo Sul\n\nBag\u00e9\n\nCa\u00e7apava\ndo Sul\n\nFig. 1 \u2013 Location and geological map of the studied area.

The assumed changes of modeling conditions\n\ndescribe a chemical disequilibrium between the\n\nrock and the fluid.\n\nii. The amount of dissolved primary phases or pre-\n\ncipitated secondary minerals required to reach\n\nanother state of equilibrium was calculated.\n\niii. The number of secondary phases was limited to\n\nthe starting paragenesis + magnetite and gold.\n\niv. The results are expressed in moles of minerals\n\nproduced or consumed by 1 kg of solution (see\n\nAppendix).\n\nConditions of fluids\n\nFor the EQ3 modeling calculations, we used an\n\ninitial fluid of 0.8 molal salinity (4.8 wt% eq. NaCl)\n\nat 300?C with an assemblage of quartz, albite,\nK-feldspar, muscovite, pyrite, magnetite and gold.\n\nThis mineral paragenesis corresponds to the miner-\n\nals formed in the rock during the gold deposition in\n\nthe phyllic alteration.\n\nThe salinity (4.8 wt% eq. NaCl) was obtained\n\nfrom aqueous and aqueous-carbonic fluid inclusion\n\ndata (Mexias 2000, unpublished data). The temper-\n\nature was set at 300?C as this is the minimum crys-\ntallization temperature for minerals of hydrothermal\n\norigin based on chlorite geothermometry and ho-\n\nmogenization temperature from fluid inclusions in\n\nquartz grains.\n\nEven if chlorite crystallization is previous to\n\ngold deposition in phyllic alteration and the fluid\n\ninclusions are in quartz grains near the mineralized\n\n(phyllic altered) portions the data is useful in the\n\nsense that this temperature is usually reported in ac-\n\ntive geothermal systems.\n\nThus, system is balanced after changing sev-\n\neral physicochemical parameters such as tempera-\n\nture, pH and salinity.\n\nThe initial gold saturation allows identifying\n\nany parameters, which will promote gold deposition\n\nin a subsequent modeling step.\n\nIn these calculations, the hydrolysis constants\n\nof the minerals generated by SUPCRT (Helgeson\n\net al. 1981), were used in combination with the\n\ndissociation constants of Au(HS)?2 , HAu(HS)\n0\n2 and\n\nAu(HS)0 derived by Benchekroun et al. (1996) from\n\nthermodynamic properties reported in Schenberger\n\nand Barnes (1989) and Hayashi and Ohmoto (1991).\n\nThe activity coefficients were calculated by using\n\nan extended Debuy-Huckel model. The raw data of\n\nthese results are listed in the Appendix.\n\nRESULTS\n\nGOLD SPECIATION WITH PH\n\nThe modeling of change of gold speciation with pH\n\nwas also calculated. Figure 2A shows that with de-\n\ncreasing pH, Au(HS)0 became the principal com-\n\nplexing species of gold. According to figure 2B, the\n\nproportion of free gold also increases with decreas-\n\ning pH. Thus, for a given Au concentration, sulfide\n\nand metallic gold will precipitate when the pH de-\n\ncreases. These results agree with those obtained by\n\nGibert et al. (1998) when studying gold solubility\n\nand its speciation in hydrothermal solutions. The\n\nauthors showed that when the temperature lies be-\n\ntween 250 and 400?C, the main complexing species\nof gold is Au(HS)0, while when the pH is > 5.5, the\n\nprincipal complexing species of gold is Au(HS)?2 .\n\nFLUID REACTION WITH THE MINERALS AT\n\nDIFFERENT CONDITIONS OF T (C? ), H+ , (OH)?\nAND KCL ADDITION\n\nNext, an assemblage of quartz, albite, K-feldspar,\n\nmuscovite, \u00b1 pyrite was put in contact with the fluid\npreviously established. The following conditions\n\nwere modeled with EQ6.\n\nTemperature variation\n\nThe temperature decrease was modeled from 300?\n\nto 200?C (Fig. 3). Figures 3A and 3B show the\nevolution of the fluid components in contact with\n\nthe mineral paragenesis while figures 4A and 4B\n\npresent the results of the behavior of this paragenesis\n\nand the magnitude of gold deposition.

B - Concentrations in\ng/Kg in K+ and Na+ solution.\n\nto only 5.84 (200?C), when a certain buffering has\nbeen observed.\n\nThe fluid shows a decrease in the concentra-\n\ntions of sulfur and f O2. The potassium content in\n\nthe solution also decreased, while that of sodium\n\nincreased (Fig. 3A and B). Potassium is consumed\n\nin the crystallization of K-feldspar and sodium goes\n\nto the solution due to the destabilization of albite\n\n(Fig. 4A). The dissolution of albite and the precipita-\n\ntion of K-feldspar, quartz and minor pyrite occurred\n\nin all phases of temperature variation. These reac-\n\ntions allow the deposition of gold (Fig. 4B), which\n\nalso occurs associated with variations in other sec-\n\nondary reactions. The sulfur in the solution migrates\n\nand forms small quantities of pyrite (+0.18g), which\n\ncan only occur if a small concentration of chlorite is\n\nalso consumed to supply the required iron (\u2013 0.214g).\n\nIf chlorite does not participate in the reaction, pyrite\n\nwill not precipitate. Therefore, more sulfur will re-\n\nmain in the solution to keep the gold complexed\n\nwhich, in turn, means that gold will not precipitate\n\n(see Appendix).\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2005) 77 (4)\n\n\n\n722 ANDR\u00c9 SAMPAIO MEXIAS ET AL.\n\nIn the modeled conditions the presence of fer-\n\nrous chlorite is a fundamental condition for gold pre-\n\ncipitation under decreasing temperature.\n\nAcidification and alkalization\n\nWhen keeping the temperature at 300?C, the min-\neral paragenesis is balanced with the starting fluid\n\nunder conditions of progressive acidification (H+)\nand alkalization (OH?).\n\nIn the case of acidification, the addition of H+\n\ndoes not alter the pH due to the buffering of the\n\nmineral paragenesis. Figures 5A, 5B and 5C show\n\nthe behavior of the fluid compounds and mineral\n\nparagenesis after the addition of H+. Significant\nvariations of K+ and Na+ were not observed (see\nAppendix), which is important to buffer the system.\n\nFigure 5A shows a small decrease in f O2 and in\n\nS2 and SO2 concentrations. The changes observed\n\nin the mineral paragenesis (Fig. 5B) show that the\n\ndeposition of chlorite consumes iron from pyrite,\n\nwhich is thus slightly destabilized; muscovite is par-\n\ntially dissolved, supplying potassium to crystallize\n\nsmall amounts of K-feldspar; quartz is slightly dis-\n\nsolved, supplying silica needed in the previous reac-\n\ntions; a very small dissolution of albite also provides\n\nsilica for the previous reactions as well as aluminum\n\nfor chlorite precipitation; sodium goes to the solu-\n\ntion causing a small enrichment in this element (see\n\nAppendix).\n\nDue to the partial dissolution of pyrite, the\n\nfluid is enriched in sulfur, which associated with ex-\n\ncess hydrogen leads to H2S enrichment in the fluid\n\n(Fig. 5C). These reactions are stimulated by the addi-\n\ntion of H+ at 300?C and do not result in gold deposi-\ntion probably because of pH buffering by the mineral\n\nparagenesis and by the absence of pyrite precipita-\n\ntion, which would stimulate the break-down of gold\n\ncomplexes from the sulfur species.\n\nWhen the solution is alkalized by the addition\n\nof OH?, deposition of gold is also observed and,\nin this case, the pH (? 5.5) seems to be buffered\nby the mineral paragenesis. There are no changes\n\nin concentrations of components and in f O2 of the\n\nfluid (see Appendix).\n\nFigures 6A and 6B show the changes of min-\n\neral paragenesis (volume and weight variation) dur-\n\ning alkalization. The results indicate that the min-\n\nerals react with each other, with chlorite and K-\n\nfeldspar being consumed, whereas quartz and mus-\n\ncovite precipitate. While pyrite (and albite) remains\n\nunchanged, the iron released by the dissolution of\n\nchlorite is used for magnetite formation (Fig. 6A\n\nand 6B).\n\nFinally, the addition of H+ or OH? seems not\nto affect the stability of gold as the pH is buffered\n\nby the mineral paragenesis.\n\nKCl addition\n\nIn order to evaluate the salinity variation, KCl was\n\nadded to the fluid, which was alkalized by the ad-\n\ndition of (OH)?. The addition of KCl modifies the\ncation activity ratio and decreases pH, leading to the\n\nprecipitation of gold.\n\nThe variations of the fluid components are\n\nshown in Table I. The pH decreases (it acidifies:\n\nfrom ? 5.5 to ? 4.74). The variation of f O2, SO2\nand S2 is smaller and it occurs when Log mol (OH)\n\n?\n\nis zero (1 mol). Nevertheless, H2S increases from\n\n0.12 to 0.13 under these conditions; K+ shows high\nenrichment and Na+ has a slight increase. The ad-\ndition of KCl obviously leads to potassium enrich-\n\nment, which will be used in K-feldspar crystalliza-\n\ntion. In this case, albite is unstable and is dissolved,\n\nreleasing sodium to the solution (Fig. 7A). These\n\nreactions are enhanced with decreasing pH.\n\nMinor reactions occur with other minerals of\n\nthe paragenesis (Fig. 7B). The modeling begins\n\n(Log mol of (OH)? from \u2013 4 to \u2013 3) with a partial dis-\nsolution of chlorite and pyrite. Magnetite is added\n\nto balance iron. Quartz and muscovite content in-\n\ncreases, balancing the decrease of albite and the\n\nenrichment of K-feldspar with the alkalization en-\n\nhancement (Fig. 7A). Pyrite shows relative enrich-\n\nment, in opposite direction to magnetite, which\n\nis depleted. Quartz, muscovite and chlorite are\n\nstrongly depleted when Log mol of (OH)? goes from\n?1 to 0.\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2005) 77 (4)\n\n\n\nGEOCHEMICAL MODELING OF GOLD PRECIPITATION 723\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nFig. 4 \u2013 A \u2013 Volume variation of minerals reacting with the fluid due to temperature decrease.

It seems that in this\n\ncase the variation in the state of oxidation influenced\n\nthe gold deposition.\n\nThis experiment shows the importance of the\n\nsilicate phases controlling gold solubility. In the\n\nBloco do Buti\u00e1 mine biotite is rare and its role in\n\ngold deposition is only theoretical.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThese results show that the processes that led to the\n\ndeposition of gold are those related to the decrease\n\nof temperature and the addition of KCl (causing pH\n\ndecrease). This decrease in pH showed to be funda-\n\nmental to gold deposition with sulfur species. The\n\nresults, when compared with observations in nat-\n\nural samples (presence of phengite and auriferous\n\npyrite), suggest that the decrease of pH and temper-\n\nature could stimulate gold precipitation from sulfur\n\ncomplexes. The addition of KCl is hardly accept-\n\nable since no chlorine was detected in phengite (Ta-\n\nble III). However, all calculations of the geochem-\n\nical mass balance had to admit the gain of some\n\npotassium in the phyllic alteration, which is the nat-\n\nural stage of gold deposition associated with pyrite.\n\nThe precipitation of pyrite may have been strongly\n\ninfluenced by iron available from the dissolution of\n\nferrous chlorite by the fluids responsible for phen-\n\ngite deposition.\n\nThe low salinities of fluid inclusions in quartz\n\ngrains of the propylitized wall rock also testify\n\nagainst the importance of chlorine as an agent of gold\n\ntransport. Therefore, sulfur, and not chlorine, com-\n\npounds must have dominated the gold complexes.\n\nThis dependence of the composition of the\n\nsulfur transport complexes from temperature could\n\nexplain why our theoretical modeling evidenced\n\na greater importance of sulfur, and not chlorine,\n\nat 300?C.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors wish to thank the Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de\n\nAperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior\n\n(CAPES) / Comit\u00ea Fran\u00e7\u00eas de Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da Coope-\n\nra\u00e7\u00e3o Universit\u00e1ria com o Brasil (COFECUB) pro-\n\ngram 349/01/03 for its financial support.\n\nRESUMO\n\nCom aux\u00edlio dos pacotes de programas EQ3/EQ6 foi\n\nrealizado um modelamento geoqu\u00edmico deposicional para\n\nouro e comparado com dados geol\u00f3gicos, petrogr\u00e1ficos,\n\ngeoqu\u00edmicos e de inclus\u00f5es fluidas da mina de ouro do\n\nBloco do Buti\u00e1, Lavras do Sul/RS.
