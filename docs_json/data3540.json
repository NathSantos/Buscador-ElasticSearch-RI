To maintain optimal\n\ngrowth in an environment without O2, rice plants develop pore spaces (aerenchyma)\n\nthat allow O2 transport from air to the roots. Carrying capacity is determined by\n\nthe rice genome and it may vary among cultivars. Plants that have higher capacity\n\nfor formation of aerenchyma should theoretically carry more O2 to the roots.\n\nHowever, part of the O2 that reaches the roots is lost due to permeability of the\n\nroots and the O2 gradient created between the soil and roots. The O2 that is lost to\n\nthe outside medium can react with chemically reduced elements present in the\n\nsoil; one of them is iron, which reacts with oxygen and forms an iron plaque on the\n\nouter root surface. Therefore, evaluation of the iron plaque and of the formation of\n\npore spaces on the root can serve as a parameter to differentiate rice cultivars in\n\nregard to the volume of O2 transported via aerenchyma. An experiment was thus\n\ncarried out in a greenhouse with the aim of comparing aerenchyma and iron plaque\n\nformation in 13 rice cultivars grown in flooded soils to their formation under\n\ngrowing conditions similar to a normal field, without free oxygen. The results\n\nindicated significant differences in the volume of pore spaces in the roots among\n\ncultivars and along the root segment in each cultivar, indicating that under flooded\n\nconditions the genetic potential of the plant is crucial in induction of cell death\n\nand formation of aerenchyma in response to lack of O2. In addition, the amount of\n\nFe accumulated on the root surface was different among genotypes and along the\n\n(1) This work was supported by Instituto Rio Grandense do Arroz - IRGA.

Para manter o crescimento sem\nO2, o arroz desenvolve o aer\u00eanquima, que permite o transporte de O2 do ar at\u00e9 as ra\u00edzes. A\ncapacidade de formar aer\u00eanquima \u00e9 gen\u00e9tica e pode variar entre cultivares; portanto, plantas\ncom maior capacidade de formar aer\u00eanquima, teoricamente, transportam mais O2 para as\nra\u00edzes. Entretanto, parte do O2 que chega at\u00e9 as ra\u00edzes \u00e9 perdido para o meio externo, que reage\ncom elementos quimicamente reduzidos no solo, entre eles o Fe2+, que se oxida e forma a\nchamada placa f\u00e9rrica na superf\u00edcie da raiz. Assim, a determina\u00e7\u00e3o da placa f\u00e9rrica e da\nforma\u00e7\u00e3o de espa\u00e7os porosos na raiz pode servir como par\u00e2metro para diferenciar cultivares\nde arroz quanto ao volume de O2 transportado via aer\u00eanquima. Dessa forma, foi conduzido\num experimento em casa de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o, visando comparar a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de aer\u00eanquima e da\nplaca f\u00e9rrica em 13 cultivares de arroz em solo alagado, com condi\u00e7\u00f5es semelhantes \u00e0s normais\nde cultivo no campo, sem a presen\u00e7a de O2. Os resultados indicaram diferen\u00e7as marcantes nos\nvolumes de espa\u00e7os porosos nas ra\u00edzes, entre os cultivares e ao longo do segmento da raiz em\ncada cultivar, indicando que, nas condi\u00e7\u00f5es de solo alagado, o potencial gen\u00e9tico da planta \u00e9\ndeterminante na indu\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 morte celular e na forma\u00e7\u00e3o de aer\u00eanquima, em resposta \u00e0 falta de\nO2.

Such changes require\nplants to develop mechanisms that allow them to carry\nO2 to the roots to maintain breathing and normal\ngrowth (Jackson &amp; Armstrong, 1999).\n\nThe most important adaptation is the formation\nof pore spaces within the root and shoot tissues, called\naerenchyma (Jackson &amp; Armstrong, 1999; Evans,\n2003; Kirk, 2004). Aerenchyma formation occurs in\ntwo ways. In the first, called constitutive or\nschizogenous, pore space results from separation and\nexpansion of cells, creating intercellular spaces that\nare part of normal development of plants even at\nappropriate levels of O2 (Jeffree et al., 1986). The\nsecond type of aerenchyma, called lysigenous, is formed\nby the death of cells in the stem and roots through a\nbiochemical process triggered by waterlogged soil\n\nconditions, especially the lack of O2 (Jackson &amp;\nArmstrong, 1999; Evans, 2003). The formation of\nlysigenous aerenchyma starts in the roots, mainly in\nadventitious roots, and extends to the base and the\nshoot (Thomson et al., 1990). This type of formation\nresults in empty spaces in the cortex of the stem and\nroots, forming a continuum between the atmosphere-\nshoots-roots (Evans, 2003; Kirk, 2004) and this makes\nthe largest contribution to the O2 supply to rice roots\nand can represent more than 30 % of total tissue\nvolume (Luxmoore et al., 1970). Differences in the\nvolume of pore spaces occur in different types of roots\nand even along the same root. For example, Armstrong\n(1971) observed aerenchyma volumes of 9 % at the\nroot tip and 45 % in mature regions near the base of\nthe rice plant.\n\nThe effectiveness of internal transport of O2 by\ndiffusion or convection depends on the physical\nresistance caused by the tortuosity of the pores, on\nthe distance traveled (Kirk, 2004), on the demand for\nO2 as a function of root tissue respiration rates, on\nsoil loss and on microorganism consumption (Kludze\net al., 1993; Hosono &amp; Nouchi. 1997; Kirk, 2004).\n\n\n\nIRON OXIDATION ON THE SURFACE OF ADVENTITIOUS ROOTS AND ITS RELATION TO...          187\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 38:185-192, 2014\n\nThese factors are determined by plant genetic\npotential, suggesting differences between species, and\neven among rice cultivars (Aulakh et al., 2000). In\nthis case, plants with high genetic capacity for\nforming pore spaces can theoretically carry more\noxygen to the roots, favoring their growth and,\nconsequently, greater depth in the soil, which may be\ndesirable due to a larger volume of soil exploited in\nthe search for nutrients (Ponnamperuma, 1972).\nHowever, the O2 transported to the roots is partially\nlost to the soil, mainly because of the O2 gradient\ncreated between the reduced soil and the inside of the\nroot. The intensity at which these losses occur is\ndetermined by root characteristics such as type, age,\ncell wall thickening, area and volume of pore spaces\n(Colmer, 2003). The amount of oxygen transported\nand released by rice roots can vary among cultivars\ndue to variation in the volume of aerenchyma (Bedford\net al., 1991), suggesting differences in the ability of\nforming a hypoxic or aerobic environment in the\nrhizosphere. This variation can influence the activity\nof aerobic microorganisms and the intensity of\nchemical and biological reactions in the rhizosphere\n(Colmer, 2003).\n\nOxygen release in the rhizosphere also enables\noxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ in the form of amorphous\niron oxyhydroxides and thereby results in its\naccumulation on the root surface and cells that form\nthe epidermal layers (Tanaka &amp; Navasero, 1966),\ncommonly called \u201ciron plaque\u201d (Chen et al., 1980).\nHowever, oxidation of Fe corresponds to only part of\nthe oxygen released by the roots; it is necessary to\nconsider consumption by microorganisms and other\nchemical reactions (Kirk, 2004). Since the reactions\nthat occur in the rhizosphere are numerous,\ndynamic and fast, it is difficult to evaluate the total\nrelease of O2 in situ by the roots, as well as the\nintensity of the chemical reactions. Several studies\ninvolving measurement of O2 losses by roots have\nbeen developed in recent years. However, due to the\nease with which O2 diffuses through organic matter\nand water, it is difficult to create and/or maintain\nan environment free of molecular O2 when working\nwith a nutrient solution with rice. Some techniques\nwhich have been used for these studies, such as\ncultivation in an agar medium in containers\npermeable to O2, exclusion of O2 with N2, and\nreducing inorganic salts, among others, have not\nbeen effective in excluding O2 from the root\nenvironment, leading to conclusions that do not\nalways express the real environment of a rice plant\nin flooded soil (Holzschuh et al., 2010).\n\nTherefore, this study was conducted in order to\ncompare rice genotypes with contrasting genetic\nbases in regard to their ability to form aerenchyma\nand to transport and release oxygen into the\nrhizosphere through the method of adventitious roots\ngrown in an environment lacking free oxygen, as in\nflooded soil.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nThe experiment was carried out at the Rice\nResearch Station (Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Experimental do Arroz -\nEEA) of the Instituto Rio Grandense do Arroz (IRGA)\n(Cachoeirinha, RS, Brazil) from November 2008 to\nFebruary 2009. The treatments compared the\nfollowing rice genotypes, representing a broad genetic\nbase: EPAGRI 108, EEA 406, BR-IRGA 409, IRGA 417,\nIRGA 420, IRGA 423, IRGA 424, IRGA 3073, Bluebelle,\nOrizica, Arize QM 1010, Avaxi and Formosa. The\ngenotypes were initially cultivated in the field until\nthe early flowering stage in a soil classified as a Typic\nHaplaquents (Streck et al., 2008) with clay content\n= 14 %, pH = 6.6, SOM (soil organic matter) = 1.8 %,\nP = 33 mg dm-3, K = 47 mg dm-3, Al = 0.1 cmolc dm\n\n-3,\nCa = 1.7 cmolc dm\n\n-3 and Mg = 1.2 cmolc dm\n-3.\n\nDetermination of the development of new adventitious\nroots, root porosity and Fe plaque is described below,\naccording to the method proposed by Holzschuh et al.\n(2010).\n\nObtaining roots of rice plants in a hypoxia\nenvironment\n\nThe study was carried out in a greenhouse with\ntemperatures ranging from 20-30 oC. A hypoxic\ncondition was obtained by exploiting oxygen diffusion\nability through the plastic vinyl material in contact\nwith the soil in a chemical reduction process. For this\npurpose, vinyl bags with dimensions of 30 \u00d7 40 cm\nand 0.1 mm thickness were used.\n\nTo develop new adventitious roots, 50 L capacity\nasbestos boxes were used. Each box received five vinyl\nbags, which were placed on a 5.0 cm soil layer at the\nbottom of the box, with a 10.0 cm distance between\nthem. An internal spacer (10 mm diameter electrical\nconductor) was placed in each bag in order to maintain\nan adequate space for root development without\nphysical resistance. The boxes were filled with Typic\nHaplaquents (Streck et al., 2008) soil, leaving the bag\nopening at 10.0 cm above the soil surface. Each bag\nreceived 150 mL of nutrient solution with the following\ncomposition in mmol L-1: 3.0 N-NO3\n\n-, 1.5 N-NH4\n+,\n\n0.5 P, 2.0 K, 1.5 Ca, 1.0 Mg, 0.023 B, 3.0 Cl, 0.0047\nCu, 0.18 Fe, 0.047 Mn, 0.00011 Mo, 0.0015 Zn and\npH 5.5 (Silva &amp; Bohnen, 2001). The soil was flooded\nand maintained at a 5.0 cm water depth for two weeks,\nwhich is long enough for the soil to be chemically\nreduced.\n\nPlants of the different genotypes initially grown\nin the field until the beginning of the flowering stage\nwere removed whole from the soil and taken to the\nlaboratory, where uniform and vigorous tillers were\nseparated and all the roots were cut near the stem of\neach plant. The plants were thoroughly washed to\navoid contamination with soil in the process of\ncultivation of adventitious roots. To reduce the\ntranspiration rate, 1/3 of the leaf blades were removed.\nThese plants were placed in vinyl bags so that their\n\n\n\nMarquel Jonas Holzschuh et al.\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 38:185-192, 2014\n\n188\n\nroot collars were at the height of the soil surface. Each\nbag received 12 plants of each genotype. After a period\nof seven days, with newly formed adventitious roots,\nplants were removed from the bags and immediately\ntaken to the laboratory. The nutrient solution was\nregularly restored in the bags when the volume was\nreduced by evapotranspiration. Analysis for\nmonitoring oxygen dissolved in the bags during root\nformation indicated a concentration of less than\n0.1 mg L-1 near the root collar (lower limit of detection\nof the oximeter used), indicating the efficiency of the\nmethod in removing the O2 and bringing about a\nhypoxic environment.\n\nIron plaque\n\nIn the laboratory, seven roots of each genotype were\ncut in 7.0 cm segments as of the apex. The roots were\nfixed in an acrylic holder, placed in a glass box (20 \u00d7\n10 \u00d7 1.5 cm) and flooded with ultra pure nitrogen\n(N2) (<1 mg L\n\n-1 O2) in order to remove the free oxygen.\nThe glass box was filled with soil solution of a\npreviously flooded Albaqualf (Streck et al., 2008) soil\nwith a history of Fe toxicity induction in susceptible\ncultivars and a stabilized reduction process, with\npH = 6.2 and 80 mg L-1 of iron (Fe2+). The soil solution\nwas obtained by a system comprised of a 50 L asbestos\nbox filled with an Albaqualf soil in an advanced stage\nof chemical reduction (Nava, 1997). The roots\nremained in the soil solution for a period of four hours\nso that the oxygen gradient formed between the inner\nroot (aerenchyma) and the soil solution would promote\nthe diffusion of molecular oxygen to the outside of the\nroots. The contact time was established from prior\ntesting to keep the Fe concentration in the solution\nfrom falling to very low levels, which would impede\ndiffusion of Fe along the roots. The release of oxygen\nby the root and the combination with Fe2+ results in\nthe formation of oxidized Fe compounds with low\ncrystallinity, forming the Fe plaque on the root\nsurface. After 4 h in contact with the soil solution,\nthe roots were washed and cut into 2.0 cm segments\nas of the apex, making up samples from each region\nof the root, which included the segments of 0-2, 2-4\nand 4-6 cm. The segments were individually\nphotographed and analyzed with the software\nSIARCS v. 3.0 to calculate the surface area of the\nsegment. Each segment received the addition of\n1.0 mL of 0.5 mol L-1 HCl and was kept at rest for\n24 h to extract the Fe contained in the root,\ncharacterizing each replication, for a total of seven\nreplications for each segment and genotype. The\nconcentrations of dissolved Fe in the samples were\ndetermined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer\n(Nava &amp; Bohnen, 2002). From the digitized images,\nthe surface area of the segment was calculated with\nthe software SIARCS v. 3.0 which, together with the\nFe concentration in the sample, allows calculation\nof the distribution of the chemical element in the\nsegment.\n\nRoot porosity\n\nFrom the same plants used for determination of\nFe plaque, another group of roots was removed for\ndetermination of porosity. Of these, 30 roots were cut\ninto segments of 0-2, 2-4 and 4-6 cm from the apex,\nforming three replicates with 10 roots for each\nsegment and genotype. Each experimental unit\nconsisted of a group containing 10 segments (replicate).\nEach group was carefully dried with tissue paper to\nremove excess water from the root surface and weighed.\nThis determination composed the dry weight of the\nroots containing the empty spaces of the aerenchyma\nwithin. The segments were then placed in a plastic\nsyringe (60 mL) containing 10 mL of water. The\nvolume of the syringe was reduced to 10 mL and its\ninlet was sealed with a silicone. The plunger was pulled\nand locked to maintain a vacuum for 3 min to extract\nthe air from the roots. After that, the plunger was\nreleased and maintained for another 3 min, allowing\nentry of water into the vacuum created inside the roots.\nThis cycle was repeated until all the segments were\ndeposited at the bottom of the syringe, indicating that\nthe pore space was completely filled with water. The\nroots were removed from the syringe and dried again\non the outside with tissue paper and weighed. The\nfresh matter difference before and after the vacuum\nand water intake treatment in the root was assumed\nto correspond to root porosity, resulting in an estimate\nof the magnitude of aerenchyma formed in each\nsegment along the root. This evaluation considers that\nthe ratio of the volume of water at room temperature\nand the specific gravity is equal to 1 and, in this case,\ncan be used as an estimate of the volume of the pore\nspaces in the root.\n\nThe test was conducted in a completely randomized\nblock statistical design with three replications. The\nresults of the weights of the root groups in evaluating\nthe porosity and the Fe content in each segment was\nconsidered simple variables with respective\nreplications and were subjected to analysis of variance\n(p<0.05) and, when significant, comparison of mean\nvalues of the treatments by the LSD test (p<0.05) was\nperformed. Furthermore, the results of porosity and\ntotal iron in each segment were correlated, and\ncorrelation coefficients were shown for each genotype.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe volume of pore spaces varied (p<0.05) among\ngenotypes for each of the three segments evaluated\nand also among segments (Figure 1). For all genotypes,\nporosity increased from the apex to the root base, as\nthe root became more mature (Figure 1). The\namplitude of these variations within each segment\nwas from 2 to 16, 22 to 56 and 45 to 89 % for 0-2, 2-4\nand 4-6 cm, respectively (Figure 1), indicating that\nthe genotypes with a different genetic base reacted\ndifferently to O2 limitation. Significant variations\n\n\n\nIRON OXIDATION ON THE SURFACE OF ADVENTITIOUS ROOTS AND ITS RELATION TO...          189\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 38:185-192, 2014\n\namong rice genotypes and among root regions were\nalso reported by Armstrong (1971) and Armstrong &amp;\nArmstrong (2005).\n\nIn descending order, the genotypes Bluebelle, EEA\n406, Avaxi, IRGA 420, Arize QM 1010 and EPAGRI\n108 developed larger diameter roots than the other\ngenotypes (Figure 2). According to Armstrong (1979)\nand Sorrell et al. (2000), the thickness of the stem\nand root structure is related to the volume of\naerenchyma formed and, hence, to the volume of O2\ntransported by these structures. However, the results\nof this study did not show this tendency, and indicated\nthat the genotypes with the highest porosity were\nOrizica, EPAGRI 108 and Formosa (Figure 3). When\n\nall of the genotypes are analyzed, it is possible to\nobserve that there was no clear relationship between\ndiameter and porosity (Figures 2 and 3), which may\nbe related to the composition of the internal structure\nof the roots and epidermal cells so as to maintain\nsufficient levels of O2 within the root to maintain\nrespiration. An important drain of O2 in the roots is\nassociated with release to outside the roots due to the\nlack of O2 in the flooded soil. In this case, a way of\nassessing the permeability of the roots to O2 is through\ndetermination of the iron deposited on the surface of\nthe roots due to oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+.\n\nThe amount of Fe accumulated on the root surface\n(iron plaque) was different (p<0.05) among the\ngenotypes and the segments (Figure 4). In general,\nthe amount of oxidized iron increased from the apex\n(0-2 cm) to the most mature region of the root (2-4\nand 4-6 cm), in accordance with the behavior of\nformation of aerenchyma for all the genotypes (Figure 1).\nThis indicates that there is a positive relationship\nbetween porosity, oxidized Fe and the oxygen\ntransported through the aerenchyma.\n\nThe correlation of porosity with Fe accumulation\nin the different segments evaluated indicates that\nalthough the increase in porosity is positively related\nto the amount of oxidized Fe, this relationship is not\nproportional among genotypes, as can be seen in the\nslope of the straight lines (Figure 5a,b). This behavior\nbecomes more apparent when the formation of average\nporosity and the cumulative sum of Fe along the\nsegments (Figures 1 and 6, respectively) is considered.\nIt may be observed that some genotypes that have\nthe highest average porosities, like EPAGRI 108,\nOrizica and Formosa, did not necessarily have the\nhighest amounts of oxidized Fe along the roots.\nTherefore, it is not possible to affirm that pore volume\nper se is the determining factor of the amount of oxygen\n\nFigure 1.

Likewise, genotypes\nArize, QM 1010, IRGA 423, Avaxi and EEA 406, which\nshowed intermediate average porosities, had the\nhighest values of total Fe (Figures 1 and 6,\nrespectively). This type of behavior occurs because\neach genotype shows variations in root permeability,\nboth for oxygen and for other gases, water, nutrients\nand toxic compounds, which alters the dynamics of\nexchanges between the inner root and the external\nenvironment (Colmer, 2003; Kirk, 2004; Kotula &amp;\nSteudle, 2009).\n\nAccordingly, other plant adaptations to oxygen\nlosses may be listed in addition to aerenchyma\nformation. The formation of physical barriers, for\nexample, reduces or prevents the outflow of oxygen in\nthe outermost layers of the root cells, allowing the\noxygen supply to be maintained at adequate levels\nwithin the root tissue, especially at the apex\n(Armstrong, 1979; Colmer, 2003; Kotula et al., 2009).\nFormation of these barriers is determined by\ncharacteristics of the cell walls that make up the\nepidermis and exodermis of roots, such as thickness\nand chemical composition (Colmer, 2003). The\naccumulation of lignin and suberin polymers around\nthe cells of the endodermis and exodermis confers\nresistance to radial oxygen loss, becoming a\ndetermining factor in the permeability of the roots\n(Armstrong et al., 2000; Armstrong &amp; Armstrong,\n2005).\n\nIn rice, the degree of suberization and lignification\nof cell walls increases significantly as the root becomes\nmature and this is indicated as the main factor for\nreducing oxygen loss from the root (Armstrong &amp;\n\n0.0\n\n2.5\n\nGenotype\n\nF\ne\n,\n\ng\n r\n\no\no\nt \n\ns\ne\ng\nm\n\ne\nn\n\nt\nm\n\n5.0\n\n7.5\n\n10.0\n\n12.5\n\n15.0\n\n17.5\n\n20.0\n\n22.5\n\n25.0\n\nab\n\na\n\nab ababab\n\nbc\n\ncd\ncdcd\n\nde de\n\ne\n\nE\nP\nA\n\nG\nR\n\nI \n10\n\n8\n\nIR\nG\n\nA\n 4\n\n23\n\nIR\nG\n\nA\n 4\n\n24\n\nIR\nG\n\nA\n 4\n\n17\n\nIR\nG\n\nA\n 4\n\n20\n\nIR\nG\n\nA\n 3\n\n07\n3\n\nE\nE\n\nA\n 4\n\n06\n\nF\nor\n\nm\nos\n\na\n\nA\nva\n\nxi\n\nA\nri\n\nze\n Q\n\nM\n 1\n\n01\n0\n\nO\nri\n\nzi\nca\n\nB\nlu\n\neb\nel\n\nle\n\nB\nR\n\n-I\nR\n\nG\nA\n\n 4\n09\n\nFigure 6.

Bras. Ci. Solo, 38:185-192, 2014\n\nArmstrong, 2005; Kotula &amp; Steudle, 2009; Kotula et\nal., 2009). On the other hand, considering that in the\nregion closest to the root apex the formation of these\nbarriers is less, due to this region being in full growth\n(Kotula &amp; Steudle, 2009; Armstrong &amp; Armstrong,\n2005; Kotula et al., 2009), the cumulative amount of\nFe is also small (Figure 4). This is because porosity\nin this region is also lower (Figure 1) and, moreover,\nit is in this region that the cell respiration rate is\nmore intense, thus consuming part of the oxygen\nthat reaches this location (Kirk, 2004). On the other\nhand, Armstrong &amp; Armstrong (2005) observed that\nradial oxygen loss was higher in the zone near the\napex of adventitious rice roots grown under low O2\navailability compared to plants grown in an aerated\nsolution.\n\nAlthough the loss of oxygen to the environment\nexternal to the root looks like a negative process, by\nreducing the amount of oxygen available for cell\nrespiration, and the formation of barriers being agents\nfor reducing these losses, attention should also be given\nto the fact that oxygen release has important functions\non root metabolism. Among the main functions is the\nreduction of exposure to Fe2+, Mn2+, H2S, S\n\n2-, HS- and\norganic acids (Armstrong, 1971; Begg et al., 1994;\nRevsbech et al., 1999). However, the barriers that\nreduce the permeability of the root to oxygen also\ninterfere with the entry of water and nutrients in the\nroot (Armstrong, 1979; Kirk, 2003). According to Kirk\n(2004), the most mature roots have less importance\nin the process of uptake of water and nutrients\ncompared to the apex region, mainly due to\npermeability. The greatest contribution of nutrients\nand water would be associated with the development\nof lateral roots, due to their greater number, increased\nspecific surface area, and also because they are directly\nconnected with the root xylem.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n1. Rice genotypes with a contrasting genetic basis\nrespond differently in regard to formation of\naerenchyma and release of oxygen by the roots.\n\n2. The porosity of adventitious roots of rice\ngenotypes is directly related to the formation of iron\nplaque, but with different magnitudes for each\nirrigated rice genotype.\n\nLITERATURE CITED\n\nARMSTRONG, W.
