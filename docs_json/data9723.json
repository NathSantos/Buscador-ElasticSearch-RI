However, the role of anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10, has \n\nnot yet been addressed. We used genetically modified mice that over-express \n\nIL-10 under the control of a zinc inducible promoter, PMT-10 mice, to address \n\nthis question.  \n\nWe show that over-expression of IL-10 led to a splenomegaly, with \n\nincrease of total number of cell numbers and the appearance of \n\nmegakarycocytes. Interestingly, we observed a substantial increase in myeloid \n\ncells and a decrease in B-lineage cells both in the spleen and the bone marrow \n\n(BM) upon IL-10 over-expression. Furthermore 30 days after induction of IL-10 \n\nexpression, a severe reduction in lymphoid precursors and an expansion of \n\nmyeloid precursors was observed in the BM. Collectively, our data suggest that \n\nIL-10 over-expression impacts hematopoiesis, inhibiting the differentiation of B \n\ncells and stimulating the differentiation of the myeloid lineage.   \n\nMoreover, the phenotype observed after IL-10 over-expression is similar \n\nto that seen in human patients and in mouse models of myeloproliferative \n\ndisorders (MPD), namely polycythemia vera (PV), thrombocythemia (ET) and \n\nprimary myelofibrosis (PMF).  \n\nMPD are frequently caused by mutations on the JAK2 gene, which are \n\npresent in 90% of patients with PV and 50% of the patients suffering from ET or \n\nPMF (11). Based on the epidemiology of MPD and on the phenotype observed \n\nfor IL-10 over-expressing mice, we hypothesize that increased IL-10 may \n\nassociate with susceptibility to MPD, explaining the 10 - 50% of cases unrelated \n\nto the JAK2V617F mutation. Therefore, PMT-10 mice are of potential interest as \n\na novel model to study the molecular mechanisms leading to MPD, in the \n\ncontext of non-mutated JAK2. In future we will explore these possibilities, as \n\nwell as the mechanism by which IL-10 interferes with hematopoiesis. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\nxviii\t\n \u00a0\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nxix\t\n \u00a0\n\nRESUMO \n \n\nAs citoquinas envolvidas na resposta imune inflamat\u00f3ria, tal como a \n\nInterleucina (IL)-3, IL-6 e IL-12, possuem um papel de grande relev\u00e2ncia na \n\nmodula\u00e7\u00e3o da hematopoiese. Contudo o papel de citoquinas anti-inflamat\u00f3rias, \n\ncomo a IL-10, n\u00e3o foi ainda esclarecido.

Differentiation of HSCs occurs in \n\nfetal liver, spleen, liver, thymus, lymph nodes and bone marrow (BM) but, \n\nthroughout adulthood it occurs mainly in the BM [1, 3, 4]. \n\nThe HSCs have the ability to repopulate the hematopoietic tissues as \n\nwell as of maintaining themselves but, when they undergo differentiation, they \n\ngive rise to a progeny that progressively loses it self-renewal capacity and \n\nbecomes restricted to one lineage [1-3, 5]. It is believed that the decision of self-\n\nrenewal versus differentiation, with loss of potential for differentiation into other \n\ncell fates [1-4, 6-11], is random whereas the later differentiation would be \n\ndetermined by signals delivered by the stromal microenvironment [2]. The \n\nidentification of stem and progenitor cells by Weissman and collaborators [6, 10, \n\n12-15] led to the construction of a hematopoietic lineage tree that is \n\ncharacterized by a cascade of binary decisions. In the BM investigators \n\nidentified a common progenitor for all lymphoid lineages, the common lymphoid \n\nprogenitors (CLP) [10], as well as a common myeloid progenitor (CMP) that \n\ngenerates granulocytic and macrophages (GM) [6]. The observation that CMPs \n\nand CLPs derived from adult BM generate mutually exclusive progeny [6, 10] \n\nsuggests that their diversification represents the earliest branching point during \n\nhematopoietic differentiation. CLPs give rise to pro-B and pro-T cells, \n\nuncommitted lymphoid progenitors that will differentiate further into mature B \n\nand T cells [10]. GM and Megakaryocyte (Meg) lineages give rise to \n\ngranulocytes, macrophages and natural killer cells (NK), and megakaryocytes \n\nand erythrocytes, respectively [6]. The offspring of GM also includes \n\nneutrophils, eosinophils, and possibly basophils/mast cells [16, 17].  \n\nUnlike all other lineages, which are specified in the BM, T cells \n\ndifferentiate after migration of early progenitors into the thymus [18]. \n\nInterestingly, was also found that CLPs are able to origin NK lineage cells [10]. \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n4\t\n \u00a0\n\nCuriously, functionally equivalent and phenotypically indistinguishable myeloid \n\nand lymphoid dendritic cells (DCs) can be derived from either CMPs or CLPs \n\n[19, 20]. A schematic representation of hematopoiesis is in figure 1.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nThe establishment of all hematopoietic lineages during development is \n\ntightly controlled by transcription factors that act in sequential and parallel \n\nfashions, building lineage-specific networks or circuits [7, 21-23].  Lineage \n\ncommitment can be induced either by extracellular factors, including cytokines, \n\ndirect cell-cell interactions, or other environmental cues [5, 9, 24]. Alternatively, \n\nintrinsic mechanisms, such as the stochastic upregulation of transcription \n\nfactors, or other regulatory molecules, such as microRNAs can also induce \n\nlineage commitment [25, 26]. Both extrinsic and intrinsic factors may either have \n\nan instructive role and actively induce commitment and differentiation or be \n\nmerely permissive for the outgrowth of pre-committed progenitors by promoting \n\ncell survival and/or expansion [24].  \n\nFigure 1. Representative scheme of the hematopoietic process. \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n5\t\n \u00a0\n\nThe role of specific transcription factors in regulating hematopoiesis has \n\nbeen addressed in much detail. B cell development requires a complex set of \n\ntranscription factors, namely PU.1, Ikaros, early B cell factor (EBF), E2A, and \n\nPax5, and inactivation of any of these factors yields a severe phenotype [27-\n\n31]. The dramatic impairment of B cell development in PU.1-deficient mice has \n\nbeen ascribed to lack of expression of the PU.1 target genes IL-7R? and EBF \n\n[28, 30] because B cell differentiation is impaired in mice deficient for either of \n\nthese genes [29, 31]. Loss of EBF blocks B cell development at the pro-B cell \n\nstage before initiation of B cell receptor (BCR) rearrangements [29]. A similar \n\nphenotype was described for E2Adeficient mice [27]. \n\nMany macrophage- and granulocyte-restricted promoters are regulated \n\nby PU.1 and/or C/EBP? [32]. These factors cooperate in the regulation of the \n\ngenes encoding the myeloid growth factor receptors MCSFR, G-CSFR, and \n\nGM-CSFR [32, 33]. Mice deficient in C/EBP? lack neutrophil and eosinophil \n\ngranulocytes, and conditional inactivation in the BM shows the specific absence \n\nof GMPs and reduced numbers of CMPs, leading to decreased formation of all \n\ndownstream lineages [34, 35]. In GATA-1-deficient embryos, development of \nerythroid cells is blocked early in differentiation, leading to a lethal anemia [36, \n\n37]. \nFurthermore, several evidences suggest that not only transcription \n\nfactors have regulatory roles in hematopoiesis, but also cytokine receptor \n\nsignalling. The involvement of cytokines in hematopoiesis will be addressed \n\nmore deeply in the next chapter. \n\n   \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n6\t\n \u00a0\n\n1.2 Cytokines and Hematopoiesis \n \n\nThe work of many groups over the past years has uncovered a great \n\ndeal of information regarding the mechanism by which cytokines modulate \n\nhematopoiesis [5].  Numerous transcription factors are induced by cytokines in \n\nthe microenvironment where lymphopoiesis and myelopoiesis are occurring to \n\ncontrol the expression of cell\u2013specific genes. Early observations show that IL-3 \n\nis a positive regulator of early erythropoiesis causing rapid cell proliferation and \n\nincreased cell survival of myeloid progenitors [38-41], acting also synergistically \n\nwith several other cytokines, such as IL-6 [42, 43] and G-CSF on committed \n\nand uncommitted myeloid progenitors [44]. It has been shown that IL-7 plays an \n\nessential role in B cell differentiation, due to the fact this cytokine is uniquely \n\nable to maintain the expression of EBF in BM derived CLP and cause the \n\nexpansion and survival of committed B cell progenitors (pro-B cell) [45]. \n\nLymphopoiesis is accompanied by a severely reduced expression of EBF in \n\nCLP [46]. Several studies demonstrated that the age-related impairment in BM \n\nIL-7 impacts also T lymphopoiesis, since in the presence of mutations in IL-7 or \n\nIL-7R gene result in a dramatic block of T cell development in the thymus [45, \n\n47-50]. \n\n  Moreover, it has been established that IL-7 promotes proliferation, \n\nsurvival, and development of pro-B cells towards the pre-B cell development \n\n[51, 52]. Interestingly, a previous study shows that the administration of IL-7 \n\nstimulates the proliferation of the myeloid lineage indirectly by the action of IL-3 \n\nand G-CSF [53]. Moreover, it has been reported that IL-3 expands an early cell \n\npopulation in vivo that subsequently requires the action of a later acting factor \n\nsuch as GM-CSF to complete its development [54]. GM-CSF also presents an \n\nimportant role in cell differentiation since GM-CSF deficiency leads to impaired \n\npulmonary homeostasis and increased splenic hematopoietic progenitors, but \n\nunimpaired steady-state hematopoiesis [55]. Like IL-7, IL-21 has also been \n\nshown to play a key role in B cell development [56]. However, in contrast to IL-\n\n7, IL-21 exerts its effects not only at early stages of the development, but also at \n\nlater stages, inducing the growth and differentiation of mature B cells into Ig-\n\nsecreting plasma cells [57, 58]. IL-6 is able to support emergency \n\ngranulopoiesis in animals that lack G-CSF and GM-CSF, two critical cytokines \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n7\t\n \u00a0\n\nnecessary for myelopoiesis [59, 60]. Interestingly, has been shown that IL-6 \n\nblocks lymphopoiesis elevating the production of myeloid cells in lupus \n\nerythematosus [61]. Recent studies show that IL-12 plays a significant role in \n\nvivo hematopoiesis by suppressing hematopoiesis in the BM, enhancing \n\nperipheral (splenic) hematopoiesis and mobilizing hematopoietic progenitor \n\ncells to the peripheral circulation [62, 63]. Other cytokines, such as Type I IFNs, \n\nare known to strongly inhibit proliferation of pro-B cells and consequently B cell \n\ndevelopment [64]. IFN? in particular, is able to activate dormant HSCs (in vivo), \n\nby promoting their efficient exit of G0 phase and entrance in the active cell \n\ncycle, thus stimulating the proliferation of HSCs. However, IFN?R mediated \n\nsignalling is not required for the HSCs function [65].  \n\n In all the role of cytokines, mainly pro-inflammatory ones, in \n\nhematopoiesis has been addressed and their contribution to the hematopoietic \n\ndecision there is well established.

T cells are an important source of IL-10, since many subsets of T \n\ncells can produce IL-10, such as Th2 cells, natural regulatory T cells, originated \n\nin the thymus and inducible regulatory T cells, originated in the periphery [67-\n\n69]. Recently, Th1 and Th17 subsets were also found to produce IL-10 [70-72], \n\ntogether with IFN? or IL-17, respectively, when induced by particularly strong \n\nantigen dose and inflammatory responses, allowing the immune responses to \n\nbe inherently self-regulating [67]. Moreover, IL-10 is produced by monocytes, \n\nmacrophages and DCs upon activation of toll like receptors (TLRs) [73, 74] and \n\nother pattern recognition receptors (PPRs) [75].  \n\nMost hematopoietic cells express the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) whereby IL-10 \n\nis able to regulate several different steps of the innate and adaptive immunity \n\n[66]. The IL-10R comprises two subunits, IL-10R1 that is expressed in most \n\nhematopoietic cells and IL-10R2, which presents a crucial role in the \n\nrecruitment of the signalling molecules Janus Kinase (JAK) [66, 76, 77]. \n\nStimulation of IL-10R-expressing cells with IL-10 leads to activation of JAK1 and \n\nTyk2, and STATs 1 and 3 [78]. STAT3 is recruited directly to sequences \n\nsurrounding two membrane-distal tyrosines in the IL-10R [79]. A schematic \n\nrepresentation of IL-10 signalling is in figure 3.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n9\t\n \u00a0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIL-10 can inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, \n\nIL-6, IL-12 and TNF, as well as the expression of chemokines implicated in the \n\nrecruitment of monocytes, neutrophils, T cells and DCs [80]. In addition IL-10 \n\ncan affect T cells directly, limiting their capacity to proliferate and produce \n\ncytokines, such as IL-2 and IFN? [81, 82], or promote the differentiation of na\u00efve \n\nT cells into IL-10-producing regulatory T cells [68]. In contrast, IL-10 also have \n\nstimulatory effects on mast cells [83, 84] and B cells by upregulating the \n\nexpression of MHC class II molecules and enhancing IgA responses [85]. IL-10 \n\ncan induce the recruitment, proliferation and cytotoxic activity of NK cells and \n\nCD8 T cells [86]. A schematic representation of IL-10 effects is in figure 4. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.

These defences can be divided into two \n\ndifferent responses, the innate immunity and the adaptive immunity [87, 88]. \n\nThe key difference between innate and adaptive immune response is the \n\npromptitude of innate immune response that uses a pre-existent repertory but \n\nlimited of response components. In contrast, the adaptive immunity response \n\nalbeit slow in activation, present the capacity of recognizing a large repertory of \n\nstrange substances and the ability of increasing the effectiveness of the \n\nresponse while innate immunity remains constant [87, 88]. As discussed above \n\nIL-10 is produced during infection by cells of the innate and acquired system, in \n\nsupport of an important role throughout the immune response. In myeloid cells \n\nFigure 4. Representative scheme of IL-10 effects. \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n11\t\n \u00a0\n\nIL-10 is induced following TLR ligation in response to an overabundance of \n\npathogen products. The magnitude of IL-10 induction within different myeloid \n\ncell types has been associated to the relative strength of extracellular related \n\nkinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) activation [89]. The induction of IL-10 in myeloid cells \n\nin response to TLR-ligands requires the signalling adaptor molecules MYD88, \n\nTRIF and numerous indirect pathways mediated by autocrine/paracrine factors \n\n[69, 90-92]. In addition to IL-10 induction by TLR-dependent stimuli, IL-10 can \n\nalso be induced from innate cells such as DC via TLR-independent stimuli \n\nincluding C-type lectin receptors (CLR), via the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) \n\ndependent pathway [93].  \n\n \n\n \n\n1.3.2 IL-10 in disease \n \n\nIL-10 has an important role in the pathogenesis of numerous disorders \n\npresenting contradictory effects. IL-10 over-expression is associated with \n\nseveral autoimmune disorders, such as Lupus erythematosus and certain \n\nlymphomas, through the action of its immunosuppressive effects [94-97].  \n\nMoreover, IL-10 deficiency is connected with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, \n\nCrohn\u2019s disease and untreated patients suffering from multiple slecorosis [98-\n\n101]. Interestingly, associations between IL-10 allelic variations and the risk of \n\ndevelopment of these disorders have been established. For example the IL-10 \n\npolymorphisms, T-3575A, G-2849A and C-2763, that lead to an increase of IL-\n\n10 expression, are associated with an increasing risk observed in patients with \n\nLupus erythematosus [102, 103]. Finally, IL-10 also regulates the immune \n\nresponses to pathogens. In this context, excess of IL-10 is often associated with \n\nchronicity, whereas its absence can cause collateral damage to the host due to \n\nan excessive uncontrolled pro-inflammatory response [104].  \n\nThe pleiotropic effects of IL-10, demonstrated by many [94-100, 105-109] \n\nhas led to a variety of clinical studies to employ recombinant IL-10 or anti-IL-\n\n10R in the treatment of patients with immune mediated diseases [110].  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n12\t\n \u00a0\n\n1.3.3 IL-10 in Hematopoiesis \n \n As mentioned before, most hematopoietic cells express IL-10R, thus are \npotentially targets of IL-10. However, the role of IL-10 in hematopoiesis has not \n\nbeen fully addressed. However, there are some evidences, gathered over the \n\nyears, suggesting that IL-10 may influence the hematopoietic process. A \n\npossible role for IL-10 in hematopoiesis was firstly illustrated, through its \n\ngrowth-promoting activity on mast cell, synergistically with IL-3 and IL-4, \n\nmegakaryocytes and multilineage colonies derived from committed progenitors \n\nand Thy1low SCA1+ [84]. Furthermore, Vlasselaer et al showed, in vitro, that IL-\n\n10 was able to stimulate the production of granulocyte/macrophage colony \n\nforming unit by blocking the TGF-? synthesis by the osteogenic stroma, \n\npromoting hematopoiesis in this microenvironment [111, 112]. There are also \n\nevidences indicating that IL-10 acts synergistically with erythropoietin \n\nsignificantly increasing erythroid differentiation and proliferation in vitro [113]. \n\nInterestingly, a bidirectional effect of IL-10 on early B cell development has \n\nbeen reported, by stimulating Flt3 ligand with IL-7, IL-10 can induce pro-B cell \n\nformation and growth before differentiation into a more mature form (CD19 \n\nexpression). On the other hand, IL-10 has been suggested to inhibit the growth \n\nof pro-B cells after differentiation, expressing CD19 [109].  An inhibitory effect of \n\nIL-10 on GM-GSF in vitro was reported, suggesting that this cytokine may have \n\npotential in the treatment of myeloid malignancies that are linked with \n\nmechanisms underlying GM-GSF deregulation [108].  As detailed in section 2 of \n\nthis thesis, our main goal was to further investigate the role of IL-10 in \n\nhematopoiesis. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n13\t\n \u00a0\n\n1.4 Deregulation of the hematopoietic process \n \n\nAs mentioned before, normal hematopoiesis is a highly regulated \n\nprocess that consists on a strict balance between self-renewal and \n\ndifferentiation of HSCs. Numbers and fate decisions made by progenitors \n\nderived from HSCs must be carefully regulated to sustain large-scale production \n\nof blood cells. As mentioned before, Interleukins, IFNs and other molecules are \n\nof great importance in regulating these processes, delivering critical cues to \n\nHSCs and progenitors.  Several of these molecules have been connected with \n\nmalignancies and are causatively involved in the development of several types \n\nof hematopoietic disorders such as leukemias, lymphopenias or \n\nmyeloproliferative disorders (MPD) [51, 58, 95-97].   \n\n Leukemias are a group of heterogeneous neoplastic disorders of white \n\nblood cells. Based on their origin, myeloid or lymphoid, they can be divided into \n\ntwo types. Leukemias traditionally have been designated as acute or chronic, \n\nbased on their untreated course [114]. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a \n\nmalignant clonal disorder of the BM lymphopoietic precursor cells [114]. In T cell \n\nALL, progressive medullary and extramedullary accumulations of lymphoblasts \n\nthat lack the potential for differentiation and maturation are present. The \n\ninvolvement of IL-7 in T cell ALL through the modulation of cell cycle regulators \n\nsuch as cyclins D2 and A has been shown [115]. In acute myeloid leukaemia \n\n(AML), the BM produces too many early blood cells, that  aberrantly express \n\nNuclear factor ?B,  which do not go on to become mature blood cells [114-116]. \n\nExcessive production of immature myeloid cells ultimately prevents the normal \n\nproduction of RBC, resulting in anaemia, and decreased production of platelets \n\nor thrombocytopenia. [116-118] \n\n Due to their possible relation to the data presented in this thesis, MPD \nare detailed in the next sections. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n14\t\n \u00a0\n\n1.4.1 Myeloproliferative Disorders \n \n\n MPD embrace several clonal hematologic diseases that are thought to \n\nrise from a transformation in a HSC [114, 119-121]. The main clinical feature of \n\nthese diseases is the overproduction of mature and functional blood cells [114, \n\n119, 120]. MPD occur primarily in the BM, but sometimes in the liver and \n\nspleen. According to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, myeloid \n\nneoplasms with 20% or more blasts in the peripheral blood (PB) or BM is \n\nconsidered to be acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This specific MPD is a result of \n\na molecular lesion in the Philadelphia chromosome BCR-ABL gene, which most \n\ncommonly results from the Philadelphia translocation [122]. Evolution to AML \n\ncan also happen, in the context of a previously disorder such as \n\nmyeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), myelodyplastic syndrome (MDS) or \n\nmyelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN). In AML, as in ALL, a \n\nproliferative of blasts in extramedullary site can also occur [114]. \n\n The three main MPDs negative for the Philadelphia translocation are \n\nPolycethemia Vera (PV), Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) and Primary \n\nMyelofibrosis (PMF) [114, 120]. PV is characterized by the massive production \n\nof mature red blood cells (RBC) in the BM, generally accompanied by an \n\nincrease of megakaryocytes and other members of the myeloid lineage [114, \n\n119-121].  Erythroid precursors in PV are extremely sensitive to erythropoietin, \n\nleading to an increase of RBC production [114]. Moreover, precursors in PV are \n\nmore responsive to cytokines such as IL-3, GM-CSF and steel factor. \n\nMegakaryocytes increase also in the BM although more than 60% of patients \n\npresent endogenous megakaryocytes colony unit formation [114, 120, 123]. As \n\na result of the increase in RBC production, an increase of blood viscosity is \n\nnormally observed in these patients, leading to thrombosis and/or bleeding \n\n[114, 119, 120]. People suffering from PV present a hematocrit between 53% \n\nand 62% [114], while 43-48% in healthy individuals, being the hematocrit values \n\nproportional to the number of thrombotic events [119, 124]. Increased platelet \n\nnumbers also contribute to these events. An enlargement of the spleen is also \n\ncommon and occurs around 75% of PV cases [114, 123]. This disorder is very \n\nrare in children and young adult, occurring in a very late stage of life, whereby \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n15\t\n \u00a0\n\nits prevalence is not very high, surrounding 3-100.000 persons per year in USA \n\n[114, 123].  \n\n PMF, in similarly to PV, is caused by an expansion of HSCs in the BM \n\n[114, 119, 120]. In PMF, cell proliferation is accompanied by a reactive \n\nnonclonal fibroblastic proliferation and fibrosis of the BM [114, 119, 120]. The \n\nproliferation of HSCs leads to the production of several factors, such as platelet \n\nderived growth factor, epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblastic growth \n\nfactor, causing the fibrosis of the BM [119, 124]. As the BM becomes fibrotic \n\nand normal hematopoiesis can no longer happen, extramedullary \n\nhematopoiesis occurs in the spleen \u2013 leading to a splenomegaly and liver \n\nenlargement [121]. As seen in PV, PMF is developed in an advanced stage of \n\nthe adult life. The prevalence of this disorder in the USA is of 1-100.000 \n\npersons per year [123]. \n\nET, the last of the BCR-ABL negative MPD, is characterized by a \n\nconstant proliferation of megakaryocytes in the BM, with an increased number \n\nof PB platelet counts [114, 119]. In this disorder, megakaryocyte progenitors are \n\nhypersensitive to the action of several cytokines, such as IL-3 and IL-6 [119, \n\n121]. The increase of platelets leads to a growth of thrombotic and hemorrhagic \n\nevents [119, 121]. A splenomegaly is also common, affecting proximately 30% \n\nof the patients [114, 119, 121]. Although it can occur at any age ET usually \n\naffects older people, with most patients diagnosed between ages of 50 and 70 \n\nyears. Like PV, ET is a rare disease diagnosed in 3-100.000 persons per year \n\nin USA [123].  \n\nThese three disorders are closely related, sharing many characteristics \n\nincluding a hypercellularity of the BM, a propensity to thrombosis and \n\nhaemorrhage and a risk of leukemic transformation in a clinical long term. The \n\nmain criteria for identifying MPDs reside in an initial diagnostic of the PB and \n\nBM by observing the blast percentage.  Blast cells should be derived when \n\npossible from 200 cell leukocyte differential counts of the PB smear and 500 cell \n\ndifferential counts of all nucleated BM cells on cellular marrow aspirate smears \n\nstained with Wright-Giemsa or similar stain [114]. Moreover, flow cytometry is \n\nthe method of choice to determine the blast lineage as well as for detecting \n\naberrant antigenic profiles. It is essential to determine a baseline karyotype by \n\nperforming a complete cytogenic analysis, as well it is to repeat it when the goal \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n16\t\n \u00a0\n\nis to judge the response to a therapy or for detecting genetic evolution.  \n\nAdditional genetic studies should be guided by the results of the initial \n\nkaryotype, and by the diagnosis suspected based on the clinical, morphological, \n\nand immunophenotypic studies. In some cases, reverse transcriptase-\n\npolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) may detect variants of well recognized \n\nabnormalities, like JAK2, MPL, KIT and GATA1 in MPDs [114, 125-129]. \n\nA certain number of criteria are required for distinguishing the MPDs \n\nsubtypes not only from each other, but also from reactive granulocytic, \n\nerythroid, and/or megakaryocytic hyperplasia that often mimics myeloproferative \n\nneoplasms (MPNs). Interestingly, it has been show that in chronic myelogenous \n\nleukemia (CML), the massive cell proliferation is caused by \n\nrearrangements/mutations of certain genes that encode surface or \n\ncytoplasmatic protein tyrosine kinase, that lead a constitutive activation of the \n\nsignal transduction pathways[114, 120, 125-130]. Some of the genetic \n\nabnormalities that responsible for MPDs, such as the mutated JAK2 or KIT, are \n\nnot specific but provide proof that the proliferation is clonal and thus, when \n\npresent, eliminate further consideration of a reactive process [114, 131]. \n\nCurrently, the most commonly recognized mutation in BCR-ABL negative \n\nMPDs is JAK2 V617F [120, 129, 130, 132]. This mutation is found in more than \n\n90% of patients with PV and proximately 50% of those with ET or PMF [114, \n\n130, 133]. Furthermore, in PV patients that lack this mutation, a similar \n\nactivating JAK2 exon 12 mutation can be found [134], and a small proportion of \n\npatients with PMF and ET of approximately 10% who lack JAK2 mutation may \n\ninstead demonstrate activating mutations of c-MPL, such as MPL W515K or \n\nMPL W515L, which produces a protein that responds to a growth factor that \n\nstimulates platelet production [128, 135, 136].  \n\n \n\n \n\n1.4.2 JAK2V617F Mutation \n \n\n The JAK family comprises four members, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and Tyk2, \n\nwhich share significant structural homology with each other [137, 138]. The \n\nkinases associate constitutively with a variety of cytokine and hormone \n\nreceptors. JAK1, JAK2 and Tyk2 are expressed throughout the body, while \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n17\t\n \u00a0\n\nJAK3 is mainly expressed in lymphoid and myeloid cells [137, 138]. Signal \n\ntransducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins are a family of \n\ntranscription factors that bind as homodimers or heterodimers to recognition \n\nsites in gene promoters. STATs are the result of seven different genes, STAT1, \n\nSTAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5A, STATB and STAT6 [137-139]. STAT proteins \n\nare selectively phosphorylated by different families of protein kinases. Some \n\ncytokines which receptors lack intrinsic tyrosine activity rely on the JAK family to \n\nphosphorylate the STAT proteins [137]. \n\nUpon binding of the specific ligands to their receptors, JAK kinases are \n\nrapidly activated and their kinase activities induced, to regulate tyrosine \n\nphosphorylation of various effectors such as STATs and initiate activation of \n\ndownstream signalling pathways: when phosphorylated STATs dimerize and \n\nbecome activated, they lead to the transcription of important genes for cell \n\nsurvival, activation and proliferation [137].  The JAK/STAT pathways mediate \n\nsignalling of several membrane receptors such as Interleukins, IFNs and growth \n\nfactors receptors, being the most common cause of abnormal JAK activation a \n\nderegulated cytokine signalling [139-141]. \n\nThree of these kinases, namely JAK1, JAK2 and Tyk2 have been shown \n\nto be involved in IL-10 signalling pathway. Finbloom et al observed that IL-10 \n\ntreatment of T cell and monocytes resulted in a ligand-induced tyrosine \n\nphosphorylation of Tyk2 and JAK1 [78]. Furthermore, Gupta et al demonstrated \n\nrecently that the IL-10/IL-10R complex upregulated JAK2 signalling [78, 142].   \n\n A mutation in the JAK2 gene, consistent of a single point alteration in \n\nJH2 auto-inhibitory domain, leads to a substitution of the aminoacid \n\n valine by phenylalanine at position 617 (V617F), resulting in \n\nconstitutively activated kinase [125, 143].  V617F mutation, as mentioned \n\nbefore, is found in a large proportion of people suffering from MPDs.  \n\n The discovery of this mutation in the JAK2 gene was of great importance \n\nsince its opened new horizons in diagnosis and treatment of MPDs. In fact, \n\nrecent studies using transgenic animals expressing the JAK2V617F mutation \n\nhave brought new insights into the world of MPDs [144, 145], suggesting that \n\nthe chronicity of human MPN may be a reflection of a balance between \n\nimpaired HSCs function and the accumulation of additional mutations, but not \n\nonly from alterations of the HSCs compartment [146-148]. Molecular testing for \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n18\t\n \u00a0\n\nsimilar mutations, but in particularly for the JAK2V617F mutation, plays a key role \n\nin the diagnosis of BCR-ACL negative MPDS as a way of separating neoplastic \n\nfrom myeloid proliferations [114].   \n\n Activating alleles of JAK2, such as JAK2 V617F, are essential to the \n\ndevelopment of MPDs, suggesting that small molecule inhibitors targeting JAK2 \n\nmay be therapeutically useful.  Several studies have reported the development \n\nof new drugs targeting JAK2, such as anagrelide, CYT387 and ruxolitinib [149-\n\n151].  CYT387 has been shown to normalize the hematocrit values, spleen size, \n\nwhite cell counts and the physiologic levels of inflammatory cytokines [151] as \n\nwell as ruxolitinib [150]. Interestingly, when in the absence of JAK2 mutations \n\nthese inhibitors are also efficient in improving MPD [149-151]. \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n19\t\n \u00a0\n\n1.5 Aims \n \n\nUnderstanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate hematopoiesis is \n\nof great importance, considering that this process is responsible for the \n\nproduction of all blood cells and that its deregulation leads to fatal diseases. \n\nAmong the factors regulating hematopoiesis are cytokines, such as IL-3, IL-7 or \n\nGM-CSF. However, the role of anti-inflammatory molecules, such as IL-10, in \n\nhematopoiesis has been less studied. Taking advantage of our IL-10 over-\n\nexpressing inducible model, PMT-10, in this thesis we propose to understand \n\nthe role of IL-10 over-expression in hematopoiesis. For that we will: \n\n \n\n- Determine the impact of the IL-10 over-expression in the differentiation of \n\nthe different cell lineages; \n\n \n\n- Study the mechanisms underlying this differentiation; \n\n \n\n- Evaluate the plasticity of our mouse model in recovering from the \n\nphenotype induced by IL-10 over-expression. \n\n  \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n20\t\n \u00a0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n21\t\n \u00a0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.

Castro and Paulo Vieira. A mouse IL-10 cDNA sequence was cloned \n\ninto the p169ZT vector, which carries a sheep metallothioneinc (MT) Ia \n\npromoter, a ?\u2014globin splice site and a polyadenylation signal. The resulting \n\nvector \u2013 pMT-IL10 \u2013 was then injected into C57BL/6 eggs and transgenic \n\nfounders were identified by PCR using MT and IL-10 specific primers. IL-10 \n\noverexpression was induced by giving the mice a 2% sucrose solution with \n\n50mM of zinf sulfate to the animals. Since the IL-10 promoter is associated with \n\na metalloprotein, the presence of zinc (Zn) in the solution induces its activation. \n\nA group of transgenic littermates were supplied with regular water as a control. \n\nAll animals were bred under specific pathogen-free conditions at ICVS. \n\n For all experiments, a group of PMT-10 mice was induced to over-\n\nexpress IL-10 [152] for 30 days. As a control, 3 different groups were used \u2013 \n\nwild type mice exposed or not to Zn and non-treated PMT-10 mice. \n\n \nELISA: The concentration of IL-10 in the mice serum was determined by \nimmunoassay using the mouse ready-set-go mouse IL-10 ELISA kit \n\n(eBioscience). \n\n \nCell Suspensions: Cell suspensions from the spleen and thymus were \nprepared by removing the organs and meshing them with a syringe pistol in ice-\n\ncold cDMEM (Gibco). BM cell suspensions were prepared by removing the \n\nfemur and tibia and sectioning its extremities. Using a syringe with a needle \n\ncontaining cDMEM the BM was flushed through the bones. The spleen, thymus \n\nand BM suspensions were then gently dispersed through a 40\u00b5m pore size \n\nnylon tissue strainer (BD Biosciences); the resultant cell suspension from the \n\nspleen, BM and blood was treated with Erythrocyte lysis solution to remove \n\nresidual red blood cells, washed and counted. These cells were used for \n\nwestern blot and flow cytometry analysis. \n\n \nHistological studies: All excised tissues were fixed in 3,7% formaldehyde and \nincluded in paraffin. Additionally, femurs were decalcified using Biodec R from \n\nBio Optica. Sections or the organs (2-4\u00b5m) were processed for light microscopic \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n24\t\n \u00a0\n\nstudies after hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and analysed using (Olympus \n\nBX61). \n \nImmunoblotting: Protein extracts were prepared from cell suspensions from \nthe spleen and BM by lysis in Lysis Buffer. 40 \u00b5g of protein lysates were \n\nresolved on 10% sodium-docecyl sufalte - 8% acrylamide gels, and transferred \n\nto a membrane (BioRad trans-blot turbo transfer pack) using Trans-Blot Turbo \n\nTransfer Starter System. Detection of the total and phosphorylated forms of \n\nJAK2 was performed using specific antibodies from Cell Signalling. \n \nBlood Smears: Smears were performed using 5 \u00b5l of blood removed from the \ntail or eye, fix and stained with Wright Stain (SIGMA). \n\n \nMicrohematocrits: Hematocrit values were measured at different time points \nby collecting of tail or eye blood in heparinised capillary tubes (Hirschman \n\nLaborgerate). These were then centrifuged at 12000rpm for 6min and RBC \n\nwere compared using a hematocrit gauge. \n\n \nSeparation of Lin- cells: Single cell suspension from the BM were subjected to \nmagnetic separation in an AUTOMACS (Mylteni) using antibodies in biotin for \n\nCD3, CD4, CD8, CD11c, CD11b, NK1.1, CD117, TER-119, B220, CD19 \n\n(Biolegend, eBioscience and BD Pharmingen).  The negative fraction \u2013 Lin- \n\nfraction \u2013 was then analysed through flow cytometry to determine the \n\nexpression SCA1, c-Kit, Fc?R and CD34 (Biolegend, eBioscience and BD \n\nPharmingen). \n \nFlow cytometry analysis: Immunofluorescence staining was performed to \ndetermine the expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11b, CD11c, CD19, B220, \n\nGR1 and Ly6G ((Biolegend, eBioscience and BD Pharmingen) on cell \n\nsuspensions from the blood, spleen, BM and thymus. Lin- cell suspension from \n\nthe BM was stained with specific antibodies for SCA1, c-Kit, Fc?R and CD34. In \n\nbrief, 1x106 cells were incubated for 10 min at 4\u00baC with Fcblock (Biolegend) in \n\nFACs buffer. Cells were then stained with primary antibodies for 30 min at 4\u00baC. \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n25\t\n \u00a0\n\nCells were analysed using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer and \n\ndata analysed using FlowJo 7.6 software. \n\n \nStatistical analysis: The results are given as means \u00b1SE.

With the \n\ngoal of characterizing the general features of PMT-10 mice under Zn \n\nadministration, a group of PMT-10 mice was induced to over-express IL-10 for \n\n30 days, the approximate period of time it takes to renewal the hematopoietic \n\ncells in the peripheral blood. IL-10 promoter was induced by administering, in \n\nthe drinking water, a solution of Zn sulphate to PMT-10 mice. As a control, 3 \n\ndifferent groups were used \u2013 wild type (WT) mice exposed or not to Zn and non-\n\nexposed PMT-10 mice (figure 5). \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.1.1 IL-10 kinetics in Zn treated PMT-10 mice \n \n\n In order to confirm that Zn treated PMT-10 mice were over-expressing IL-\n\n10 we measured the amounts of seric IL-10 by immunoassay, as shown in \n\nfigure 6. The levels of IL-10 in WT, WT exposed to Zn and non-treated PMT-10 \n\nmice, in the serum of peripheral blood were below the detection level (BDL) of \n\nthe assay, at all the time points analysed.  In Zn treated PMT-10 mice high IL-\n\n10 amounts were detected at day 5 (5 days after Zn-mediated induction), \n\nincreasing until day 15 and held up to day 30, when the IL-10 induction with Zn \n\nwas ended.   \n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nFigure 5.

For that, spleens were collected and compared \n\nbetween the Zn-exposed PMT-10 mice and the control groups. As show in \n\nfigure 7a, the induced PMT-10 presented a pronounced splenomegaly. This \n\nenlargement of the spleen was accompanied by a sharp increase of the total \n\nnumber of cells, reaching approximately 450 million of cells compared to the100 \n\nmillion cells in WT exposed or not Zn and non-treated PMT-10 mice (figure 7b). \n\nThe spleen weight in treated PMT-10 mice also increased (figure 7c). All control \n\ngroups \u2013 WT exposed or not to Zn and non-exposed PMT-10 mice, maintained \n\na normal spleen size and weight, with no alterations of the total number of cells \n\n(figure 7a-c).\t\n \u00a0\n\n0 10 20 30 40\n0\n\n5000\n\n10000\n\n15000\n\n20000\n\n25000\nPMT-10\nPMT-10 + Zn\n\nTime (days) post zinc administration\n\nIL\n-1\n\n0 \nex\n\npr\nes\n\nsi\non\n\n (\n?\ng \n\n/m\nl)\n\nFigure 6.

The \n\nprofile presented by MPD patients and mouse models [114, 119-121], is in line \n\nwith the characteristics seen in PMT-10 mice over-expressing IL-10, adding a \n\nnew perspective to IL-10 functions.   \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n35\t\n \u00a0\n\n3.2  Impact of IL-10 over-expression in hematopoiesis \n \n\n3.2.1 IL-10 over-expression leads to changes in spleen cell \npopulations \n\n \nSince we observed a massive increase in the spleens of the PMT-10 \n\nmice exposed to high levels of IL-10, we next investigated whether a normal \n\ndistribution of cellular populations was occurring. To test this, we induced IL-10 \n\nover-expression by feeding PMT-10 mice with Zn for 30 days and evaluated the \n\nmajor leukocyte subsets by flow cytometry. In WT mice exposed or not to Zn \n\nand non-exposed PMT-10, the total number of B and T lymphocytes and \n\nmyeloid cells, in the spleen, was maintained over time (figure 10a-f). PMT-10 \n\nmice over-expressing IL-10 presented a total number of cells of the B and T cell \n\nsubsets similar to the other groups (figure 10a and 10c). However, the \n\npercentage of these populations significantly decreased (figure 10b and 10d) \n\nsuggesting the increase of other cellular populations. Indeed, we observed a \n\nsustained increase on the number and percentage of the myeloid lineage.  \n\nThese alterations characterized by a decrease of the lymphoid lineage in favour \n\nof the myeloid lineage that leads to a sharp increase of total cell number and \n\nconsequently to a splenomegaly, are similar to the ones seen in MPD patients \n\n[114, 119-121]. In these patients, the growth of the myeloid lineage is a \n\nconsequence of an extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen with loss of BM \n\nhematopoiesis [114, 119-121]. Seen this we questioned whether, in PMT-10 \n\nmice over-expressing IL-10, the observed increase of the myeloid population \n\nwas specially caused by (i) a proliferation of HSC in the spleen \u2013 extramedullary \n\nhematopoiesis, (ii) the transference from the BM or (iii) a synergistic effect \n\nbetween the two organs.  \n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0 \t\n \u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n36\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\na b \n\nc d \n\ne f \n\nFigure 10.

To evaluate this, we measured by flow \n\ncytometry, the expression of B220, CD11b, CD19 and GR1 populations in the \n\nBM after 30 days of IL-10 over-expression in the PMT-10 mice. We found a \n\nsimilar profile to the observed in the spleen, characterized by a sharp decrease \n\nin the B cell subset and an increase in the macrophage/ granulocyte population \n\nupon IL-10 over-expression (figure 11).  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTo further investigate these results, we next investigated whether the \n\ncomposition of early hematopoietic precursors in the BM was altered by IL-10 \n\nover-expression.

For this, histological sections from wild type or \n\nPMT-10 mice exposed or not to Zn were prepared and stained with HE. As \n\nshown in figure 14, the BM of PMT-10 mice over-expressing IL-10 presented an \n\naltered structure of BM with a striking disappearance of megakaryocytes, \n\nindicating that IL-10 was affecting the hematopoietic process.  The decrease \n\ncellularity and the disappearance of megakaryocytes, together with the massive \n\ndecrease of B cells and increased myeloid population in the BM, suggest the \n\nimpairment of hematopoiesis. Furthermore, these events are in line with the \n\noccurrence of a extramedullary hematopoiesis at the spleen level.  These \n\nresults are in line with the MPD profile since a decrease BM cellularity with \n\nspecial decline of erythropoiesis and megakaryocytopoiesis is one the \n\ncharacteristics from patients suffering from MPD [114, 119-121, 144, 145], \n\nsuggesting that IL-10 over-expression may influence normal hematopoiesis in a \n\nvery similar way to MPD. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n41\t\n \u00a0\n\nFigure 14.

PMT-10 \n\nmice over-expressing IL-10 develop a splenomegaly, accompanied by an \n\nincrease of the total cell number mainly composed by cells of the myeloid \n\nlineage. BM from these animals present an impairment in hematopoiesis, that \n\nleads to a cellularity decrease. These features result in a specific phenotype \n\nthat resembles the one seen in MPD patients [114, 119-121, 144, 145]. \n\nNevertheless several questions remain open, such as the evaluation of the \n\nplasticity of our mouse model in recovering, both at the macroscopic and the \n\nfunctional levels, from the phenotype induced by IL-10 over-expression. \n\nWe now want to explore our findings further, at the cellular and molecular \n\nlevels, to clarify how IL-10 can shift hematopoiesis towards the myeloid lineage. \n\nCurrently we are studying the plasticity of the organism when exposed to IL-10. \n\nTo do so, we are performing experiments by exposing the animals to Zn for 30 \n\ndays followed by 15 days without Zn and repeat this cycle 3 or more times. At \n\nthe end of each exposure or resting period, a group of animals will be sacrificed \n\nand the spleens, BM and blood will be harvested for cell population analysis by \n\nflow cytometry and tissue organization by histology (figure 16). \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nFigure 16.

Differentiation of HSCs occurs in fetal liver and in BM \n\nthroughout adulthood, under the control of signals delivered by stromal \n\nmicroenvironment [1-4]. These signals regulate the proliferation, the survival \n\nand the differentiation of HSCs by activating genetic programs that determine \n\nthe specification of the precursors along the different lineages, with loss of \n\npotential for differentiation into other cell fates [1-4, 6-11]. Deregulation of the \n\nhematopoietic process often leads to fatal diseases, such as \n\nimmunodeficiencies, leukemias and MPDs [51, 57, 95-97]. Therefore, the \n\nunderstanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate hematopoiesis is of \n\ngreat importance. Several lines of evidence implicate interleukins, IFNs and \n\ncolony stimulating factors in hematopoiesis [35, 51, 52, 54, 62, 63, 153]. Each \n\nof these factors functions alone or in combination with the others. Moreover, the \n\ndirect action of these factors in a cell lineage can influence indirectly other \n\nlineages [9, 43, 154-156].  \n\nThe influence of several cytokines, such as IL-3, IL-7 or GM-CSF, in \n\nhematopoiesis has been well reported over the years [31, 51, 53, 54, 153, 154, \n\n156] but the role of IL-10 in this process is still awaiting clarification. So far, the \n\npresence of IL-10 has been implicated in several hematopoietic disorders, such \n\nas diffuse B cell lymphoma (DBCL) and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma [142, 157]. \n\nThis possible involvement raises several questions, including the detailed \n\nunderstanding of the impact of IL-10 on cell differentiation and proliferation. In \n\nthis context, a mouse model able to transiently over-express IL-10 under a tight \n\ncontrol presents itself as an interesting tool to study the impact of IL-10 in \n\nhematopoiesis. PMT-10 mice are such model, where IL-10 over-expression is \n\ninduced after Zn administration. \n\nOur results, obtained by comparing PMT-10 under Zn administration to \n\ncontrol PMT-10 or to Bl6 mice fed with Zn or not, demonstrate that high levels of \n\nIL-10 may impact normal hematopoiesis. By characterizing in detail the effect of \n\nIL-10 over-expression in PMT-10 mice, we found that in this situation they \n\npresented a pronounced splenomegaly not seen in the remaining groups (figure \n\n7a), accompanied by an increase of total spleen cell numbers and spleen \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n52\t\n \u00a0\n\nweight (figure 7b and 7c). A structural disorganization of the spleen of PMT-10 \n\nmice over-expressing IL-10 was also observed (figure 8a), with the appearance \n\nof giant cells, morphologically resembling megakaryocytes (figure 8b). These \n\ncells were found in various stages of differentiation, including early stages of \n\ndevelopment, suggesting that they were being produced in the spleen. These \n\nfirst evidences, characterized by splenomegaly and increase in the number of \n\nmegakaryocytes in the spleen of PMT-10 over-expressing IL-10, called our \n\nattention since they resemble the phenotype exhibited by MPD patients [114, \n\n119, 121, 123, 127]. Moreover, this same profile has also been reported in \n\nmouse models of MPD, namely those expressing the JAK2V617F mutation [144, \n\n145]. Whether PMT-10 mice over-expressing IL-10 represent a novel model of \n\nMPD remains to be clarified. \n\nSecondly, we need to clarify whether extramedullary hematopoiesis is \n\noccurring. For that, we started by investigating in detail the impact of high IL-10 \n\nlevels in the cells of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages. In the spleen of PMT10 \n\nmice over-expressing IL-10, we observed a substantial increase in myeloid cells \n\n(CD11b+GR1+) with a corresponding decrease in B and T-lineage cells (figure \n\n10). Moreover, we observed that the decrease seen in B and T-lineage cells \n\nwas not due to a drop of its total cell number but to a massive increase of total \n\nmyeloid cell numbers, which altered the normal ratio between these subsets. \n\nAlthough an increase of the total number of myeloid cells was observed, one \n\nquestion remained. Were the cells from the myeloid lineage proliferating in the \n\nspleen? Or were these cells accumulating in the spleen due to defect in their \n\nhoming/egress? Answers to these questions are essential to prove or not the \n\noccurrence of extramedullary hematopoiesis and therefore to conclude whether \n\nIL-10 over-expression I slinked to MPD.  \n\nTo answer the first question, we started evaluating the different leukocyte \n\nsubsets in the BM.  \n\nWe found that, similarly to the changes seen in spleen, the BM presented a \n\nsharp decrease of the B cell population whereas cells from the myeloid lineage \n\nsuffered an increase (figure 11). To further investigate our findings, we next \n\naddressed if the IL-10 induced differences seen in the proportions of B cells and \n\nmyeloid cell in the BM resulted of alterations of the hematopoietic process. \n\nInvestigation of the composition of early hematopoietic precursors revealed that \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n53\t\n \u00a0\n\n30 days after induction of IL-10 expression in PMT-10 mice, a significant \n\nincrease of the SCA1 and SCA1/ cKIT positive cells was observed in the BM \n\n(figure 12). It has been reported that SCA is a marker highly expressed in \n\nprimitive HSCs whereas cKIT is expressed not only in HSCs but also in the \n\ncommon progenitors [146]. A shift towards the SCA positive population \n\nobserved in PMT-10 mice over-expressing IL-10 indicates that hematopoiesis in \n\nthe BM was being affected in a very early step of differentiation (figure 12). \n\nMoreover, the remaining cells that followed the pathway of differentiation, \n\nthat is the cKIT positive cells, suffered a bias towards the myeloid lineage. \n\nThese alterations resulted in a severe reduction in lymphoid precursors \n\n(B220lowCD19+) (figure 13a) and an expansion of CMP in the BM of PMT-10 \n\nmice over-expressing IL-10 (figure 13b). Interestingly, the different myeloid \n\nprecursors were not affected equally, being the differentiation into MegE \n\nprogenitors inhibited whereas the differentiation into GMP was stimulated, \n\nresulting in a granulocyte/macrophage proliferation.  The phenotype observed in \n\nBM after IL-10 over-expression, was similar to that seen in human patients and \n\nin mouse models of MPD [114, 119-121, 123, 144, 145].  \n\nA structural analysis of the BM of PMT-10 mice over-expressing IL-10 \n\nshowed interesting results, revealing a decrease of the BM cellularity with a \n\nvisible decline of erythropoiesis and megakaryocytopoiesis (figure 14). These \n\nfeatures are suggestive of BM aplasia, a condition characterized by a gradual \n\ndecrease of cell count resulting in the production of fewer blood cells, including \n\na sharp drop of RBC and white blood cells [158]. Thus, the increase of myeloid \n\ncells seen in the spleen may not strictly be due to a stimulation of proliferation of \n\nthe myeloid lineage in the BM, but due to extramedullary hematopoiesis at the \n\nspleen level.  \n\n In future, we will explore our findings further, by evaluating the occurrence \n\nof a local cell proliferation in the spleen of Zn-exposed PMT-10 through \n\nbromodeoxyuridine (BudR) quantification. Moreover, to investigate whether the \n\nhoming/egress of cells to and from the spleen mice over-expressing IL-10 is \n\naltered, we will evaluate the expression of chemokines involved in the cell \n\ndisplacement from one organ to another, by analysing their expression profile \n\nby RT-PCR.    \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n54\t\n \u00a0\n\nAlthough we have seen that, in the BM, IL-10 over-expression led to a shift \n\nof hematopoiesis towards the myeloid lineage, we have not yet clarified the \n\nmechanisms by which IL-10 impacts the hematopoietic process. Is IL-10 acting \n\ndirectly or indirectly via other factors? (figure 20) CMP differentiation is \n\nregulated by several factors, such as IL-3, GM-CSF and erythropoietin [6]. Any \n\ninfluence in the expression of these cytokines, whether negative or positive, is \n\nexpected to have consequences in the normal course of hematopoiesis. IL-3 \n\nacts synergistically with other cytokines to promote the differentiation of the \n\nmyeloid progenitors [54, 55]. Several studies demonstrate that numerous \n\ntranscription factors are induced by cytokines in the microenvironment where \n\nlymphopoiesis is occurring to control the expression of B cell\u2013specific genes. \n\nE2A induces expression of EBF and, together, these two transcription factors \n\nactivate Pax-5, whose expression marks commitment to the B cell lineage [29, \n\n46, 159]. IL-7 has an important role in the expression of EBF in CLP, whereby \n\nits blockade leads to an impairment of B cell differentiation [31, 53]. In Pax-5 \n\ndeficient mutants, B cell differentiation is also blocked, albeit at a later stage \n\nthan in EBF mutants, and precursors retain the ability to differentiate into other \n\nhematopoietic lineages [47]. It is possible that IL-10 influences hematopoiesis \n\nindirectly whereby the cytokines and transcription factors mentioned above are \n\ngood candidates for the role of intermediate molecules. IL-10 may be acting \n\nthrough IL-3, inducing its expression and consequently leading to a proliferation \n\nof the myeloid lineage. On the other hand, IL-10 can also be blocking the \n\nexpression of IL-7, promoting the proliferation of the myeloid lineage indirectly, \n\nby blocking the differentiation of CLP. A synergistic action between IL-10 and \n\nIFN? is also possible, given the ability of IFN? to promote differentiation of \n\nHSCs [65]. The mechanism by which IL-10 impacts hematopoiesis is a topic \n\nthat we also want to address in the future. Using highly enriched HSCs isolated \n\nby cell sorting and differentiated in vitro in stromal cell-free cultures, in the \n\npresence or absence of IL-10, we would be able to determine the impact of IL-\n\n10 over-expression in the differentiation of different cell lineages in vitro. These \n\nassays would allow us to assess whether IL-10 affects hematopoiesis by \n\ndirectly acting on uncommitted precursor cells. If we observe that IL-10 is acting \n\nindirectly, the impact of candidate cytokines mediating this effect will be \n\nassessed by using available knock-out mice, antibodies to those proteins or by \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n55\t\n \u00a0\n\nthe addition of recombinant cytokines. We also plan to measure the presence of \nthese cytokines in the serum of PMT-10 mice over-expressing IL-10 and \n\ncompare the obtained values to those of control animals. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAs already mentioned, the phenotype revealed in PMT-10 mice upon Zn \n\nexposure is similar to that observed in MPD. Indeed, the splenomegaly, \n\nincreased total spleen cell numbers, structural disorganization and increased \n\nnumber of megakaryocytes in the spleen, are all features observed in mouse \n\nmodels and humans patients of MPDs.  Interestingly, the alterations seen in the \n\nBM, namely the hematopoiesis impairment, loss of cell cellularity, decreased \n\nerythropoiesis and consequently decreased % of B cells and RBC, are all in line \n\nwith a MPD. In addition, blood analysis revealed similar results to the ones seen \n\nin the spleen and BM, characterized by a decrease on percentage of B cells \n\npopulation and an increase on myeloid cells in PMT-10 mice over-expressing \n\nIL-10 (figure 15b). Moreover, a decrease in the % of RBC in PMT-10 over-\n\nexpressing IL-10 was observed (figure 15a). Accordingly to the WHO \n\nguidelines, the patients suffering from PV present an increased % of RBC while \n\npatients suffering from ET or PMF present a normal or small decrease % of \n\nRBC [114]. The decreased value of RBC seen in PMT-10 mice over-expressing \n\nIL-10 can be related to the increase % of platelets (data not shown) by an \n\nFigure 20. Representative scheme of possible mechanisms of IL-10 \nimpact in hematopoiesis. \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n56\t\n \u00a0\n\nalteration of normal cellular proportions, and not only to the impairment of \n\nerythropoiesis. Since megakaryocytes are the platelets precursors, the increase \n\nin the number of megakaryocytes in PMT-10 mice over-expressing IL-10 might \n\nresult in an increase platelet count, explaining these results.  It will therefore be \n\nof utmost importance to now quantify a series of parameters in PMT-10 mice, \n\nsuch as total and differential counts of white blood cells, RBC and platelets \n\nincluding the mean globular volume and the mean platelet volume. All these \n\nparameters were shown to be altered in a MPD scenario. \n\nMPD are frequently caused by mutations on the JAK2 gene, which are \n\npresent in 90% of patients with PV and 50% of the patients suffering from ET or \n\nPMF [114, 129, 133, 143, 147]. Based on the epidemiology of MPD and on the \n\nphenotype observed for IL-10 over-expressing mice, we hypothesize that \n\nincreased IL-10 may associate with susceptibility to MPD, explaining the 10 - \n\n50% of cases unrelated to the JAK2V617F mutation. Therefore, PMT-10 mice \n\nare of potential interest as a novel model to study the molecular mechanisms \n\nleading to MPD, in the context of non-mutated JAK2. Since IL-10 has been \n\nrecently shown to induce abnormal JAK2 activation in the context of DBLC \n\n[142], we have accessed whether JAK2 hyper-activation underlies the \n\ndevelopment of MPD in the PMT-10 mice. To study this hypothesis, we are \n\ncurrently comparing by Western Blot the levels of JAK2 phosphorylation in BM \n\ncells from PMT-10 mice over-expressing or not IL-10.  \n\nTo study the plasticity of the PMT-10 model in recovering from IL-10 \n\nexposure, we have exposed the animals to Zn for 30 days followed by 15 days \n\nwithout Zn administration, stopping the induction of IL-10 (figure 17). A \n\nregression to normal size from the spleens of PMT-10 mice that previously \n\npresented a splenomegaly was observed (figure 18a). Moreover, all changes \n\nthat accompanied the splenomegaly disappeared, occurring a regression of \n\nweight and total number of cells of the spleens from PMT-10 mice previously \n\nexposed to Zn (figure 18b and 18c). The different cell populations, including the \n\n% of RBC, returned to normal in all organs previously affected namely the \n\nspleen, BM and blood (figure 18f-i). However, there are some questions that \n\nneed to be further investigated. Firstly, even though the spleen has recovered \n\nhis structural organization, are the different cell populations in their normal \n\nlocation? Secondly, are the cells functional after these alterations? Thirdly, how \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n57\t\n \u00a0\n\nplastic is this system? These are questions that we would like to address in the \n\nfuture. \n\nRegarding the structure of the spleen, we will analyse if it returns to normal \n\nafter the end of the Zn induction. To do so, we will perform a detailed analysis of \n\ncellular composition and distribution, using specific antibodies to trace B and T \n\ncells, and immunohistochemistry to observe the localization of marginal zone B \n\ncells and follicular B cells. In parallel, and to address if the spleen function is \n\nrecovered, we will infect animals intravenously with Streptococcus pneumonia, \n\nmeasuring the progression of the bacterial load over time and the life span of \n\nthe infected PMT-10 mice. Finally, and in what concerns the third question, we \n\nare currently addressing more thoroughly the system plasticity, by exposing the \n\nanimals to Zn for 30 days followed by 15 days without Zn, and repeating this \n\ncycle 3 or more times. This will provide evidence on how transient is the effect \n\nof IL-10 over-expression. Of note, we have recent data showing that PMT-10 \n\nover-expressing IL-10 do not survive for more than 160 days, presenting a \n\nsplenomegaly even more notable than day 30 and a gradual cellular loss in the \n\nBM (data not shown).  \n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0 In summary, the work presented here highlights two novel findings: that \n\nhigh IL-10 amounts impacts hematopoiesis, promoting the differentiation of \n\nmyeloid cells and that IL-10 may be involved in the development of MPD in a \n\ncontext of no JAK2 mutations. Although further mechanistic studies are needed \n\nto explain these findings, this thesis opens many new questions and avenues of \n\nresearch that are worth investigating. Furthermore, if needed a parallel between \n\nthe effects of IL-10 over-expression and MPD is in place, the elucidation of \n\nthese mechanisms, using PMT-10 mice, may lead to the development of new \n\napproaches to the tackle MPD. \n  \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n58\t\n \u00a0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n59\t\n \u00a0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5.

We showed that IL-10 over-expression \n\nimpacts the hematopoietic process by impairing the development and promoting \n\nthe differentiation of the myeloid lineage. These features acquired with IL-10 \n\nover-expression led to: \n\n \n\n- a splenomegaly, structural disorganization and increased number of \n\nmegakaryocytes in the spleen, with an associated decrease of cells \n\nfrom lymphoid lineage.  \n\n- a decrease of the BM cellularity with a visible decline of \n\nerythropoiesis and megakaryocytopoiesis. \n\n- a shift of the cKIT population towards the SCA positive population. \n\n- the stimulation of GMP differentiation. \n\n \n\nUnderstanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate hematopoiesis is \n\nimportant, taking into account that this process is responsible for the production \n\nof all blood cells and that its deregulation leads to fatal diseases. With this work \n\nwe place IL-10 as one of the mediators of the hematopoietic process with \n\npossible implications with disease. \n\nThe phenotype observed in PMT-10 mice over-expressing IL-10 show \n\nsome similarities to the one seen in patients and mouse models of MPD. To \n\nestablish PMT-10 mice as a potential model for MPD, several factors need to be \n\nfurther clarified. If this proves to be the case the elucidation of the molecular \n\nmechanisms underlying IL-10 action, using PMT-10 mice, may lead to the \n\ndevelopment of new approaches to study and tackle MPD. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n62\t\n \u00a0\n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n63\t\n \u00a0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6.
