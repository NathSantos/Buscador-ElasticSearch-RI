A. da Silveira for his guidance.\nI owe him everything I am and conquered in my short carrier to his advising, patience and trust.\nAlways thoughtful and concerned about my carrier, Ilson encouraged me all the time in the past seven\nyears, providing great opportunities and exposing me to interesting problems. He also shared with me\nhis passion for combining observations with theory, which definitely shaped my view about physical\noceanography.\n\nSecondly, I thank my parents Rosimeire and Claudio, and my brother Lucas. Their unconditional\nsupport always pushed me forward in the pursuit of professional and personal fulfilment. This work\nwould not have been possible without them I and hope to let them proud.\n\nMy sincere thanks to Prof. Dr. Glenn R. Flierl. He opened the doors of one of the most renewed\nuniversities in the world for me. Dr. Flierl\u2019s precise suggestions and willingness to discuss and listen\nto my own findings and conclusions, made me more independent and rigorous scientist. Moreover, the\ncontact with outstanding researchers and bright students at MIT and WHOI was highly stimulating.\n\nI will not forget the period spent as a visiting student at MIT for reasons that transcend the academic\nachievements. I brought from Boston many great memories, real friends and a wonderful person who\nI expect to spend the rest of my life with (my little Asian/Brazilian girlfriend Rosangela Hoshi).\n\nI would like to express all my gratitude for my great instructors/mentors in physical oceanography:\nBelmiro Castro, Edmo Campos, Paulo Polito, Olga Sato, Marcelo Dottori, Ilson Silveira, Sueli Godoi\nand Alberto Piola. I hope I demonstrated everything I have learned from you in this thesis.\n\nMany thanks to all my past and present labmates.

The quasi-synoptic\ndata revealed that the BC is ?400-500 m deep to the north of the so-called Santos Bifurcation (26\u00b0S-\n28\u00b0S) and extends down to 1000 m to the south of it. We estimated that the BC receives at least\n7 Sv from the Santos Bifurcation, which drastically alters the BC\u2019s velocity vertical structure and\nmeanders characteristics as it flows poleward. Based on direct velocity measurements, we computed\nthe mixed-instability properties at three different latitudes (24\u00b0S, 26\u00b0S and 30\u00b0S). The instability\nanalysis revealed unstable current systems to mesoscale perturbations with maximum growth rates of\n0.12, 0.19 and 0.06 day?1 at 24\u00b0S, 26\u00b0S and 30\u00b0S respectively. The corresponding downstream phase\nspeeds are -0.19, -0.24 and -0.26 m s?1. The analysis of the mean-to-eddy energy conversion terms\nshow that the barotropic instability drains 60-90% less energy from the background state than the\nbaroclinic instability. Nevertheless, the maximum growth rates are at least the double in magnitude\nwhen both instabilities occur simultaneously. The topography presents a stabilizing effect for both\nkind of instabilities along all the BC path.\n\nAt the vicinities of the Cape Santa Marta (28\u00b0S), we explored the the recurrent cyclonic mean-\nders of the BC. Combining a wide range of observations, we provided a overview of such features\nand the relations between its velocity patterns, the water properties (temperature, salinity, nutrients),\nchlorophyll-a distribution and the BC variability. The top-bottom quasi-synoptic velocity measure-\nments depicted cyclonic meanders over the continental slope with diameters larger than 100 km and\nvertically extending to approximately 1500 m depth. Moreover, the observed eddies seems to trap\nand recirculate a small portion (?1.5 to 4 Sv) of the BC main flow (-13.16 to -17.89 Sv), which is\nconsisted of Tropical Water (TW), South Atlantic Central Water (SACW), Antarctic Intermediate Wa-\nter (AAIW) and Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW). Additionally, we presented observational\nevidence that the meanders actively influence the transport of nutrient-rich shelf waters to the open\nocean enhancing the primary productivity at the photic zone over the continental slope. Satellite\nimagery show that these cyclonic events occur 5-6 times per year and are generally associated with\nwave-like perturbations on the flow with mean wavelength of ?219 km. Finally, Empirical Orthog-\nonal Functions (EOF) analysis computed from an array of mooring lines show that more than half of\nthe along-isobath velocity variance on the continental slope is explained by the BC mesoscale activity.\n\nKeywords: Brazil Current, Santos Bifurcation, mesoscale activity, baroclinic instability, barotropic\ninstability.\n\nx\n\n\n\nResumo\n\nAs propriedades de instabilidade temporal mista da Corrente do Brasil (CB), entre 23\u00b0S-30\u00b0S, foram\ninvestigadas combinando dados hidrogr\u00e1ficos e medi\u00e7\u00f5es diretas de velocide com modelagem num\u00e9rica.\nAs observa\u00e7\u00f5es revelaram uma CB com ?400-500 m de profundidade ao norte da Bifurca\u00e7\u00e3o de\nSantos (26\u00b0S-28\u00b0S). Em contrapartida, a CB ao sul da bifurca\u00e7\u00e3o se mostrou muito mais profunda\n(> 1000 m) devido ao aporte de aproximadamente 7 Sv de \u00e1guas em profundidades intermedi\u00e1rias\n(?500-1500 m) oriundas do ramo sul da Bifurca\u00e7\u00e3o de Santos.

In both article-like chapters we study the Brazil Current (BC) meandering at 23\u00b0S-31\u00b0S from\nobservations and numerical modelling. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the BC circula-\ntion pattern and mesoscale activity (Section 1.2) and the thesis motivation, hypothesis and objectives\n(Section 1.3). Chapter 4 summarizes our primary findings.\n\n1.2 A regional overview of the large and meso scales circulation\nof the southwestern Atlantic\n\n1.2.1 The South Atlantic Subtropical Gyre and the Brazil Current\n\nThe South Atlantic Subtropical Gyre (SASG) is the most prominent wind driven large scale circulation\nfeature of the South Atlantic in the first ?1000 meters of water column. Due to the combination of\nthe presence of continents, Earth\u2019s rotation and sphericity, it consists of an asymmetric anticyclonic\ngyre that is intensified at the western boundary of the oceanic basin Talley et al. (2011).\n\nThe BC is the western boundary current of the SASG (Figure 1.1). As it flows south/southwestward\nover the southeast Brazilian shelf break and continental slope between ?15\u00b0S-27\u00b0S, the BC presents\nan unique vertical velocity structure compared to other subtropical western boundary currents. Ob-\nservations consistently depict the BC as a shallow and weak current compared to its counterparts in\nthe Northern Hemisphere, the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio (Talley et al., 2011, e. g.,). In this re-\ngion, the BC transports Tropical Water (TW) near-surface and South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) at\npycnocline depths. In contrast, at intermediate levels (?500-1800 m) there is a counterflow called the\nIntermediate Western Boundary Current (IWBC), flowing north/northeastward, transporting mainly\nAntarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) (e. g., Stramma and England, 1999).\n\n1\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Schematics of the surface circulation of the South Atlantic. The black lines and arrow rep-\nresent the main currents and their sense. The SASG (?10\u00b0S-40\u00b0S) is delimited by the South Equatorial\nCurrent (north), the BC (west) and South Atlantic Current (south). The light grey shades indicate the\nmajor topographic features. Source: Talley et al. (2011) - http://booksite.academicpress.com/DPO\n\nIn a broad sense, the BC could be thought as the Sverdrup\u2019s return transport of the wind-driven\nlarge-scale circulation. However its singular velocity pattern may be explained in part by the interac-\ntion of the buoyancy-driven and wind-driven circulations as suggested by Henry Stommel in Stommel\n(1965). At that time, Henry Stommel proposed that the primary difference between the BC and the\nGulf Stream\u2019s transport relies on the direction of the thermohaline circulation (now commonly re-\nferred as buoyancy-driven circulation) at intermediate depths in the South and North Atlantic (Figure\n1.2).\n\nObservations south of 28\u00b0S have shown that the entire water column over the shelf break and\ncontinental slope flows poleward transporting TW, SACW and AAIW (e. g., Zemba, 1991; M\u00fcller et al.,\n1998). The transport differences between these two sectors of the BC is very variable since estimates\nof the BC volume transport reported in the literature varies from -5 to -16 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3 s?1) to the\nnorth of 25\u00b0(Signorini, 1978; Miranda and Filho, 1979; Evans et al., 1983; Stramma, 1989; Garfield,\n1990; Campos et al., 1995; Silveira et al., 2001; Bil\u00f3 et al., 2014) and from 10 to 27 Sv to the south\nof 28\u00b0S (Garfield, 1990; Zemba, 1991; Rocha et al., 2014).\n\nThe vertical structure change in these western boundary currents is linked to the complex depth-\ndependent bifurcation system of the South Equatorial Current (SEC) over the Brazilian continental\nmargin (e. g., Stramma and England, 1999; Boebel et al., 1999; Rodrigues et al., 2007). The float\nobservations from Boebel et al. (1999) and Legeais et al. (2013) indicate that at intermediate levels\n\n2\n\n\n\nthe so-called Santos Bifurcation occur between 25\u00b0S and 27\u00b0S and incorporates the AAIW flow to the\nBC over the continental slope (blue arrows in Figure 1.3).\n\nFigure 1.2: Schematic representation of the Stommel\u2019s possible explanation for the differences in\ntransport of the Gulf Stream and the BC.

Meanders and eddies\nhave been reported and studied by several authors from the BC genesis site (?15\u00b0S) to the Brazil-\nMalvinas confluence (?39\u00b0S) (Signorini, 1978; Garfield, 1990; Campos et al., 1995; Oliveira et al.,\n2009; Soutelino et al., 2013), however few studies have addressed its dynamics. Between 22\u00b0S and\n30\u00b0S the BC meanders are commonly reported as a sequence of cyclones and anticyclones as shown\nin Figure 1.4 (e. g., Campos et al., 1995, 1996; Silveira et al., 2008; Lorenzzetti et al., 2009).\n\nSilveira et al. (2008) were the first to address the dynamics of the formation of such features.\nThey showed that the mean BC at 22.7\u00b0S is baroclinicaly unstable. These authors were successful in\npredicting the length scales of the mesoscale variability in the region with an one-dimensional quasi-\ngeostrophic (QG) stability model. The most-unstable waves produced by the model have growth rates\nabout 0.06 (0.05) days?1, wavelength about 266 (388) km and very small propagation speeds (quasi-\nstationary waves).\n\nIn order to elucidate the role of the BC-IWBC interaction in the development of meanders and\neddies between 20\u00b0S-28\u00b0S, Fernandes et al. (2009) implemented an idealized two-layer shallow water\nnumerical model for the region. They approximated the horizontal velocity profiles of the currents\nsystem to opposing Gaussian jets over a realistic bathymetry. Their numerical experiment generated\nweakly unstable waves (?0.02 day?1) of 430 km and phase propagation ?-0.2 m s?1 (negative speeds\nindicate propagation poleward). These waves mostly grow in amplitude 20\u00b0S-25\u00b0S, on the other\nhand to the south of 25\u00b0S the larger meanders gradually decrease their amplitudes. Fernandes et al.\n(2009)\u2019s results seem to explain the southward eddy-motion description by Garfield (1990) from\nsatellite imagery, however the differences with the Silveira et al. (2008)\u2019s work at 22.7\u00b0S, suggest that\nother factors, as horizontal velocity structure (barotropic instability) and the rough topography, might\nhave important impact in eddy formation.\n\nMore recently Rocha et al. (2014) carried out a similar stability analysis to Silveira et al. (2008) at\n22.7\u00b0S, 25\u00b0S and 28\u00b0S in order to study the influence of the BC downstream changes in the baroclinic\ninstability phenomena. The authors found that all the regions present a system baroclinicaly unstable\nwith most-unstable waves of 230 km and growth rate of 0.035 day?1 at 22.7\u00b0S, 190 km and 0.056\nday?1 at 25\u00b0S, and 180 km and 0.030 day?1 at 28\u00b0S. In agreement with Silveira et al. (2008), the\nunstable QG waves at 22.7\u00b0S have very small phase speeds (0.03 m s?1). Conversely, the perturbations\nat 25\u00b0S and 28\u00b0S present significant phase propagation with -0.13 m s?1 and -0.15 m s?1, respectively.\nThese authors also found that the most unstable waves at 25\u00b0S and 28\u00b0S are slightly more efficient in\nextracting energy from the mean flow than at 22.7\u00b0S.\n\nBased on a primitive equations (PE) numerical simulation, Mano et al. (2009) described energy\nfluxes during the a growing cyclonic meander at 22\u00b0S. Although the basic phenomenology is qualita-\ntively consistent with the baroclinic instability arguments from Silveira et al. (2008), the meandering\nseems to be much more complicated. The Oliveira et al. (2009)\u2019s study of surface energetics from\ndrifting buoys shows that the eddy kinetic energy is relevant along all the BC path and part of its\nvariability may be accounted for by barotropic instabilities.\n\nAdditionally, in the Santos Basin (23\u00b0S-28\u00b0S) dipoles are recurrently observed in SST distributions\n(e. g., Figure 1.4). Miranda (2013) built a QG semi-analytical model to study the dynamics of the BC\n\n4\n\n\n\ndipoles. The author demonstrates how the barotropic instabilities and topography are able to generate\npropagating dipoles in the region.\n\nFigure 1.4: Advanced High Resolution Radiometer sea surface temperature (SST) image for July 20,\n1993. The BC mesoscale activity is represented by a sequence of of crests (warm) and troughs (cold).\nThe arrows highlight the cyclonic (solid) and anticyclonic (dashed) meanders. Adapted from Campos\net al. (1996).\n\n1.3 Thesis motivation, hypothesis and objectives\n\nEven today most of the available information about the velocity structure and volume transport of\nthe BC is based on geostrophic calculations. Direct velocity observations are still rare and sparse in\nspace and time (e. g., Rocha et al., 2014; Bil\u00f3 et al., 2014). Moreover studies that addressed the\nBC downstream changes from velocity observations, or based their analysis on currentmeters records\nsparsely placed at different locations of the BC path (M\u00fcller et al., 1998; Rocha et al., 2014), or are\nlimited to a fix depth (Boebel et al., 1999; Oliveira et al., 2009; Legeais et al., 2013).\n\nIn a such changing system the characteristics of its stability properties also changes. Different\nstudies carried out barotropic and baroclinic stability analysis between 23\u00b0S and 31\u00b0S, however none\nhave explored the consequences of those processes occurring simultaneously (the mixed-instability\nproblem) and the effects of the continental slope topography in this region. Moreover, the estimates\n\n5\n\n\n\nof growth rates and phase speeds of unstable waves rely on the quasi-geostrophic (QG) approximation.\nNo instability computations employed primitive equations (PE) so far.\n\nIn that sense, there is a lack of important information concerning the BC horizontal and vertical\ndownstream changes at 23\u00b0S-31\u00b0S and the dynamics of the BC meandering growth and propagation.\nMotivated by these open questions, we formulated the hypotheses bellow:\n\nHypothesis 1 Although the downstream changes on the BC meander characteristics and growth\nare mainly due to the BC thickening and baroclinic instability, the barotropic instability and\ntopography have a significant impact on the linear instability properties along the BC path;\n\nHypothesis 2 The BC meandering off Cape Santa Marta (? 28\u00b0S) is as frequent as the meanders\ndescribed north of the Santos Bifurcation (25\u00b0S-27\u00b0S), and presents a vertical extension of more\nthan 1000 m transporting TW, SACW, AAIW and UCDW.\n\nIn particular the Chapter 2\u2019s specific objectives are to draw a three-dimensional picture of the\ncirculation over the southeast Brazilian shelf break and continental slope and to investigate the mixed-\ninstability properties of the BC (23\u00b0S-30\u00b0S), by answering the following scientific questions:\n\n1. What are the differences between the instabilities to the north and to the south of the Santos\nBifurcation?\n\n2. What are the instability driving-mechanisms?\n\n3. What are the effects of topography?\n\nThe Chapter 3\u2019s main objective is to describe the characteristics of the BC variability and cyclonic\nmeanders near Cape Santa Marta (28\u00b0S).\n\n6\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nOn the Brazil Current Meandering at\n23\u00b0S-30\u00b0S\n\nAbstract\n\nWe use hydrographic and direct velocity observations from two quasi-synoptic cruises in conjunction\nwith a primitive equation linear instability model, to investigate the Brazil Current (BC) downstream\nchange effect between 23\u00b0S-30\u00b0S on the temporal mixed-instabilities properties. The quasi-synoptic\ndata revealed that the BC is ?400-500 m deep to the north of the so-called Santos Bifurcation (26\u00b0S-\n28\u00b0S) and extends down to 1000 m to the south of it. We estimated that the BC receives at least\n7 Sv from the Santos Bifurcation, which drastically alters the BC\u2019s velocity vertical structure and\nmeanders characteristics as it flows poleward. Based on direct velocity measurements, we computed\nthe mixed-instability properties at three different latitudes (24\u00b0S, 26\u00b0S and 30\u00b0S). The instability\nanalysis revealed unstable current systems to mesoscale perturbations with maximum growth rates of\n0.12, 0.19 and 0.06 day?1 at 24\u00b0S, 26\u00b0S and 30\u00b0S respectively. The corresponding downstream phase\nspeeds are -0.19, -0.24 and -0.26 m s?1. The analysis of the mean-to-eddy energy conversion terms\nshow that the barotropic instability drains 60-90% less energy from the background state than the\nbaroclinic instability. Nevertheless, the maximum growth rates are at least the double in magnitude\nwhen both instabilities occur simultaneously. The topography presents a stabilizing effect for both\nkind of instabilities along all the BC path.\n\nKeywords: Brazil Current, Santos Bifurcation, mesoscale activity, baroclinic instability, barotropic\ninstability.\n\n7\n\n\n\n2.1 Introduction\n\nThe Brazil Current (BC) is likely the most peculiar and least studied of the world\u2019s major western\nboundary currents. Observations between 20\u00b0S and 25\u00b0S consistently depict the BC as a shallow\nand weak current compared to its counterparts in the Northern Hemisphere, the Gulf Stream and\nthe Kuroshio current, as it flows poleward over the southeast Brazilian shelf break and continental\nslope (e. g., Talley et al., 2011). In this region, the BC transports Tropical Water (TW) near-surface\n(&lt;200 m) and South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) at pycnocline depths (Campos et al., 1995).\nAt intermediate levels (?500-1800 m), there is a counterflow called Intermediate Western Boundary\nCurrent (IWBC), flowing equatorward, transporting mainly Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) and\nUpper Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW) (e. g., Silveira et al., 2004). In a broad sense, the BC could\nbe thought as the Sverdrup\u2019s return transport of the wind-driven large-scale circulation of the South\nAtlantic, however its singular velocity vertical structure may be explained in part by the interaction\nof the buoyancy-driven and wind-driven circulations, as suggested by Stommel (1965).\n\nObservations south of 28\u00b0S have shown that the entire water column over the shelf break and\ncontinental slope flows poleward transporting TW, SACW, AAIW and UCDW (e. g., Zemba, 1991;\nM\u00fcller et al., 1998). This interesting feature is linked to the complex depth-dependent bifurcation\nsystem over the Brazilian continental margin that feeds and thickens the BC along its poleward path\n(e. g., Stramma and England, 1999; Boebel et al., 1999; Rodrigues et al., 2007). The analysis of\ntrajectories of Lagrangian floats performed by Boebel et al. (1999) and Legeais et al. (2013) showed\nthat at intermediate levels (800-1200 m) the so-called Santos Bifurcation occur between 25\u00b0S and\n27\u00b0S.\n\nUnfortunately, most of our understanding about the BC-IWBC system relies on quasi-synoptic hy-\ndrographic observations, which constrained the development of quantitative descriptions of these cur-\nrents and its downstream changes (Signorini, 1978; Miranda and Filho, 1979; Evans et al., 1983;\nStramma, 1989; Garfield, 1990; Campos et al., 1995; Lima, 1997; Silveira et al., 2001). Between\n23\u00b0S and 30\u00b0S, only four studies provide quantitative descriptions of the BC-IWBC system based on\ndirect velocity measurements: (Evans and Signorini, 1985); (M\u00fcller et al., 1998); (Rocha et al., 2014);\n(Bil\u00f3 et al., 2014). Evans and Signorini (1985) presented a series of cross-isobath velocity profiles at\napproximately 23\u00b0S, which revealed that the BC extends to depths of 400-500 m and a counterflow is\npresent underneath, reaching depths about 1000 m. M\u00fcller et al. (1998) and Rocha et al. (2014) ad-\ndressed the BC vertical thickening by comparing records from currentmeter mooring lines at different\nlatitudes. Finally, Bil\u00f3 et al. (2014) presented a quasi-synoptic velocity transect measured by lowered\nAcoustic Doppler Current Profiler (LADCP), providing by the first time estimates of BC-IWBC system\nvolume transport from direct velocity measurements at ?26\u00b0S.\n\nAnother interesting characteristic of the BC is its intense mesoscale activity. Meanders and eddies\nwere reported and studied by several authors (e. g., Signorini, 1978; Garfield, 1990; Campos et al.,\n1995, 1996; Silveira et al., 2008; Mano et al., 2009; Rocha et al., 2014); however few studies have ad-\ndressed its dynamics. Silveira et al. (2008) showed that the BC-IWBC system at 22.7\u00b0S is baroclinicaly\nunstable. These authors were successful in predicting the length scales of the mesoscale variability in\nthe region with an one-dimensional quasi-geostrophic (QG) stability model. The most-unstable waves\nproduced by the model have growth rates about 0.06 (0.05) days?1, wavelength about 266 (388) km\n\n8\n\n\n\nand very small propagation speeds (quasi-stationary waves).\nIn order to elucidate the role of the BC-IWBC interaction in the development of meanders and ed-\n\ndies between 20\u00b0S-28\u00b0S, Fernandes et al. (2009) implemented an idealized two-layer shallow water\nequations numerical model for the region. They approximated the horizontal velocity profiles of the\nBC System to opposing Gaussian jets over a realistic bathymetry. Their numerical experiment gener-\nated weakly unstable waves (?0.02 day?1) of 430 km and phase propagation ?-0.2 m s?1 (negative\nspeeds indicate propagation poleward). These waves mostly grow in amplitude 20\u00b0S-25\u00b0S, on the\nother hand to the south of 25\u00b0S the larger meanders gradually decrease their amplitudes. Fernandes\net al. (2009)\u2019s results seem to explain the southward eddy-motion described by Garfield (1990) from\nsatellite imagery, however the differences with the Silveira et al. (2008)\u2019s work at 22.7\u00b0S, suggest that\nother factors, as horizontal velocity structure (barotropic instability) and the rough topography, might\nhave important impact in the initial stages of eddy formation.\n\nRecently, Rocha et al. (2014) carried out a similar stability analysis to Silveira et al. (2008) at\n22.7\u00b0S, 25\u00b0S and 28\u00b0S in order to study the influence of the downstream changes in the baroclinic\ninstability phenomena. The authors found that all the regions present a BC system1 baroclinicaly\nunstable with most-unstable waves of 230 km and growth rate of 0.035 day?1 at 22.7\u00b0S, 190 km\nand 0.056 day?1 at 25\u00b0S, and 180 km and 0.030 day?1 at 28\u00b0S. In agreement with Silveira et al.\n(2008), the unstable QG waves at 22.7\u00b0S have very small phase speeds (0.03 m s?1). Conversely,\nthe perturbations at 25\u00b0S and 28\u00b0S present phase propagation with -0.13 m s?1 and -0.15 m s?1,\nrespectively. These authors also found that the most unstable waves at 25\u00b0S and 28\u00b0S are slightly\nmore efficient in extracting energy from the mean flow than at 22.7\u00b0S.\n\nBased on a primitive equations (PE) numerical simulation, Mano et al. (2009) described energy\nfluxes during the growing of a cyclonic meander at 22\u00b0S. Although the basic phenomenology is qual-\nitatively consistent with the baroclinic instability arguments from Silveira et al. (2008), the mean-\ndering seems to be much more complicated. The Oliveira et al. (2009)\u2019s study of surface energetics\nfrom drifting buoys shows that the eddy kinetic energy is relevant along all the BC path and part of\nits variability may be accounted for by barotropic instability. Additionally, in the Santos Basin (23\u00b0S-\n28\u00b0S) dipoles are recurrently observed in the sea surface temperature images. Miranda (2013) built a\nQG semi-analytical model to study the dynamics of the BC dipoles. The author demonstrates how the\nbarotropic instabilities and topography are able to generate propagating dipoles in the region.\n\nIn summary, different studies carried out barotropic and baroclinic stability analysis between 23\u00b0S\nand 30\u00b0S, however none have explored the consequences of those processes occurring simultaneously\n(the mixed-instability problem) and the effects of the continental slope rough topography in this\nregion. In that sense, there is a lack of important information concerning the dynamics of the BC\nmeandering growth and propagation.\n\nHere, we draw a three-dimensional picture of the circulation over the southeast Brazilian shelf\nbreak and continental slope and investigated the mixed-instability properties of the BC (23\u00b0S-30\u00b0S).\nOur guiding questions are: (1) What are the differences between the instabilities to the north and\nto the south of the Santos Bifurcation? (2) What are the instability driving mechanisms? (3) What\nare the effects of topography? To address these questions we analyse two quasi-synoptic data sets in\n\n1From now on the BC and the IWBC underneath it will be referred as BC system for simplicity. This term was proposed\nin Portuguese by Godoi (2005) and introduced in the English language by Rocha et al. (2014).\n\n9\n\n\n\nconjunction with a PE linear instability model.\n\n2.2 Quasi-synoptic observations\n\n2.2.1 The data set\n\nWe mainly explored two quasi-synoptic data sets in this work, in order to accomplish our objectives\nand answer the guiding questions. The first data set is the forth leg of the CERES experiment which\nconsisted of five quasi-synoptic hydrographic surveys to investigate the BC and its recirculation cells\nwithin the Santos Basin (e. g., Bil\u00f3 et al., 2014). This cruise was carried out in June 2010 and\nconsists of a set of stations where top-bottom hydrographic and velocity profiling where taken with\nConductivity, Temperature and Depth (CTD) and LADCP, respectively. Underway, 75 kHz vessel-\nmounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (VMADCP) observations from surface to approximately\n400 m and shipboard thermosalinograph measurements at ?10 m depth were also obtained. These\nmeasurements are disposed in four transects, as shown by Table 2.1 and panel a of Figure 2.12.\n\nThe second data set was acquired in November of 2013 and it is part of the INCT-CARBOM\nexperiment, which aims to study carbon fluxes in the Brazilian continental margin. The CARBOM\ncruise consists of seven quasi-synoptic transects where CTD, LADCP and VMADCP measurements were\nconducted. Its important to mention that the four transects further north in our study region are\nrepetitions of the correspondent transects in the CERES IV cruise (24S, 24.5S, 25S and 26S from\nFigure 2.1), so it can also be referred as the fifth survey of the CERES Experiment.\n\nTable 2.1: Start and end dates of each quasi-synoptic transect from CERES and CARBOM experi-\nments used in this study.\n\nTransect ID Start date End date\nCERES IV\n24S 08-Jun.-2010 11-Jun.-2010\n24.5S 11-Jun.-2010 14-Jun.-2010\n25S 14-Jun.-2010 18-Jun.-2010\n26S 18-Jun.-2010 21-Jun.-2010\nCARBOM\n24S 01-Nov.-2013 03-Nov.-2013\n24.5S 04-Nov.-2013 06-Nov.-2013\n25S 08-Nov.-2013 10-Nov.-2013\n26S 12-Nov.-2013 14-Nov.-2013\n28S 18-Nov.-2013 19-Nov.-2013\n29S 20-Nov.-2013 21-Nov.-2013\n30S 22-Nov.-2013 23-Nov.-2013\n\n2The transects identification names were given based on its respective mean latitudes\n\n10\n\n\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 2.1: Data set acquired during (a) the CERES IV cruise (June 2010) and (b) the CARBOM\ncruise (November 2013). The circles represent the locations where only CTD profiles are available\nand the stars indicate the stations where LADCP and CTD data were acquired simultaneously. The\nblack numbers are the corresponding transects identification.\n\nDuring the surveys, velocity profiles were obtained using the same downward-looking 300 kHz\nLADCP Workhorse Sentinel from RD Instruments. The average velocity profile at each station was\ncalculated following the procedures described by Fischer and Visbeck (1993) and Visbeck (2002).\nThe ocean velocities in the first 400 m, which were measured simultaneously by a 75 KHz VMADCP\nOcean Surveyor (also from RD Instruments), were included in the LADCP data processing to addi-\ntionally constrain the solution of the inverse problem. This methodology reduces errors because the\nconstraints from bottom tracking and the upper ocean velocities force the average velocity profile to\nagree with these more accurate data (e.g., Visbeck, 2002; Schott et al., 2005). In general, the estimated\naccuracy of the LADCP varied from 3 cm s?1 in the constrained domain to 5 cm s?1 in the middle of\nthe water column (400 m? depth ?bottom-100 m). The VMADCP data processing was conducted us-\ning the processing software Common Ocean Data Access System (CODAS) from the Currents Group\nof the University of Hawaii.\n\nIn this section we focus on the description of the velocity sectional distribution measured with the\nLADCP (stars presented in Figure 2.1), giving emphasis on the BC and IWBC. The other observations\nare used as auxiliary information to help us interpret the measured velocity signals. Moreover, these\ndata consist of an important framework for the instability study in Section 2.3.\n\n2.2.2 The Brazil Current system\n\nOverall horizontal patterns\n\nA general picture of the BC system captured by our observations set is shown in Figure 2.2. These\nmaps of vectors represent the velocity horizontal distributions in the BC (100 m) and in the IWBC (800\nm) domain. The 100 m and 800 m depths were carefully chosen, because they present a clear signal of\n\n11\n\n\n\nthe currents system and are close to BC and IWBC respective maximum velocities area (e. g., Legeais\net al., 2013; Bil\u00f3 et al., 2014). Please note that the vectors from different cruises are not in the same\nscale for better visualization.\n\nBetween 23\u00b0S and 31\u00b0S, the shelf break position location is approximately represented by the\n200 m isobath. Moreover, the location of the continental slope bottom varies from ?2000 m in the\nSantos Plateau area (23\u00b0S-28\u00b0S) to approximately 2700 m depth to the south of 28.5\u00b0S (Castro and\nde Miranda, 1998). In that sense, we should expect to find the BC system velocity signal between the\n200 m and 2300 m isobaths in the Figure 2.2.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 2.2: Velocity vectors obtained from VMADCP measurements at 100 m depth (red arrows) and\nLADCP observations at 800 m depth (blue arrows) taken during the (a) CERES IV (June 2010) and\nthe (b) CARBOM (November 2013) cruises. The contoured isobaths (gray lines) are 100, 200, 1000,\n2300 and 3000 m.\n\nDuring the the CERES IV cruise (panel a, Figure 2.2) we observe a very interesting scenario\nconcerning the BC system. At transect 24S, the parabolic-shaped BC is well defined by the largest\nsouthwestward vectors over the continental slope. Further south, the BC seems to anticyclonically\nmeander as it crosses the transects 24.5S and 25S, where no clear velocity signal of the boundary\ncurrent is observed over the slope. In fact, at 24.5S the largest vectors are close to the 2300 m isobath\nand over the outer shelf, which differs entirely to the velocity signal at transect 25S, where the fastest\nvelocities are placed over the shelf-break and outer shelf. At transect 26S it is possible to distinguish\nthe BC signal again between the 200 m and 1000 m isobaths.\n\nAt 800 m depth, the IWBC signal is distinguishable flowing notheastward in the study region. Note\nthat, at transect 24.5S, the velocities are considerable smaller and the vector closer to the 1000 m\nisobath is the only one with a northward velocity component, which suggests that part of the IWBC\nis crossing the 24.5S transect and part might be recirculating. The float trajectories presented by\nLegeais et al. (2013) show that such activity exists indicating the presence of meanders and water\nrecirculation.\n\nDuring the CARBOM cruise (panel b, Figure 2.2) the BC system path is clear at all transects over\n\n12\n\n\n\nthe continental slope. Moreover the CARBOM larger spacial coverage allows us to identify the Santos\nBifurcation area between transects 26S and 28S due to the divergence of the vectors at 800 m depth.\nNote that at transects 26S and 29S cyclonic eddy-like structures are present due to the change from\nequatorward flow to poleward flow as we move away from the coast.\n\nIts is important to stress out that we did not provided an explanation concerning the BC path and\nits possible meandering activity at transects 24.5S and 25S from CERES IV cruise, until now. So,\nbefore moving forward with the description of the velocity sectional distributions we should shed light\non the matter. Its well known that the BC flows carrying oligotrophic, warm and salty TW (T>20\u00b0C,\nS>36) in the upper mixed-layer and the cooler SACW at pycnocline depths (10\u00b0C<T<18\u00b0C, 35<S<36)\n(Emilson, 1961; Stramma and England, 1999). In the mixed-layer, the TW is in contact with cooler\nand fresher coastal waters creating a thermal and haline contrast between the water masses, moreover\nshelf waters tend to be more biological productive than the oceanic ones due to a variety of reasons\n(Talley et al., 2011). In that sense, the zoomed-in region displayed in Figure 2.3 might give us a good\nidea of what is happening in the mixed-layer regarding the BC meandering.\n\nUsing the salinity and temperature measured by the thermosalinograph along the ship route, we\nwere able to obtain the distributions of these properties at approximately 10 m depth (Figure 2.3 panels\na and b, respectively). We also looked at the chlorophyll-a concentration at the surface from the\nModerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor aboard of the Aqua satellite (Figure\n2.3 panel c). We opted to use a cloud free image by accessing the 8-day composite product available\nin the NASA\u2019s OceanColor Web (http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/) from the cruise time period.\n\nThe analysis of the salinity, temperature and chlorophyll-a distributions between transects 25S and\n26S indicates that the BC is meandering over the outer-shelf at transect 25S. The anticyclonic meander\nsignature can be found in Figure 2.3 by following the offshore displacement from the 100 m isobath to\nthe vicinities of the shelf break (200 m isobath) of the maximum velocity vectors, isotherm of 22.5\u00b0C,\nisohalines of 36.0 and 35.5, and chlorophyll-a concentration front as the BC flows southward. If we\napply the same reasoning for transects 24S and 24.5S, or 24.5S and 25S we are lead to conclude that\nthe BC crosses the transects 24.5S and 25S over the outer-shelf forming a large anticyclonic mean-\nder. Note that the chlorophyll-a distribution has a local maximum of concentration that resembles a\ncyclonic eddy signature at transect 24.5S. Since it does not have a clear signal in the temperature and\nsalinity fields, we interpreted this feature as an eddy that pinched off from the BC and is interacting\nwith the meandering current.\n\nAdditional indication of the existence of this large anticyclonic meander is given by Figure 2.4.\nOne of the primary mechanisms that regulates the penetration of the SACW in the continental shelf\nbetween 24\u00b0S and 25\u00b0S is the BC meandering (e. g., Matano et al., 2010; Cerda and Castro, 2014).\nIn that sense, we studied the temperature fields using CTD stations over the continental shelf and\nshelf-break at each transect (Figure 2.4). The penetration of the SACW is shown by the 18\u00b0C and\n15\u00b0C lines. Since the transect 24S is too close to Cape Frio, it is expected to observe temperatures\nlower than 20\u00b0C reaching regions close to the sea surface near the 100 m isobath due to the frequent\nwind forced upwelling system (e. g., Signorini, 1978; Castro and de Miranda, 1998). Therefore,\ncomparing the temperature section at transect 26S to the fields at 24.5S and 25S, the 15\u00b0C isotherm\nreaches shallower regions under the meandering scenario.\n\n13\n\n\n\nXXXX\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 2.3: Velocity vectors obtained from VMADCP measurements at 100 m depth (black arrows),\ntaken during the CERES IV cruise, superimposed on the distribution of (a) salinity at 10 m (thermos-\nalinograph), (b) temperature at 10 m (thermosalinograph) and (c) chlorophyll-a concentration at the\nsurface (satellite image). The contoured isobaths (gray lines) are 100, 200, 1000, 2300 and 3000 m.\n\n14\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Temperature (\u00b0C) sectional distributions over the continental shelf and shelf break vicini-\nties measured during the CERES IV cruise. The black triangles represent the locations of the CTD\nstations.\n\nVelocity transects and the BC downstream changes\n\nOnce identified the location of the BC system through the study area, we were able to better interpret\nits top-bottom velocity distribution and how it changes as the BC flows poleward. In that sense, we\ndescribed the cross-sectional velocity component of each transect obtained from a composition of the\nLADCP and VMADCP data. Such composites were created for two reasons: to improve the horizontal\nresolution in the upper 300-400 m between the LADCP profiles; and complement the observations\nover the continental shelf if necessary. Similar procedures were carried out by other authors (e. g.,\nSchott et al., 2005) and are essential to better identify different features in the velocity distribution.\nIt is important to mention that we do not present the composites for transects 24.5S and 28S due to\nthe lack of LADCP profiles or no robust cross-sectional velocity component. In Figures 2.1 and 2.2 we\ncan observe that the first condition is true for the CARBOM 24.5S transect and the second is true for\nthe CERES IV 24.5S and CARBOM 28S transects.\n\nWe also associated the western boundary circulation with the vertical disposal of the water masses\nalong the transects. The TS Diagram overlaid on the M\u00e9mery et al. (2000) climatological water mass\ninterfaces (Figure 2.5) show the presence of the water masses TW near surface, SACW at pycnocline\ndepths, AAIW, UCDW and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), and Table 2.2 presents the mean depth\nof the respective interfaces. Note that the TW-SACW and SACW-AAIW interfaces are placed at\n\n15\n\n\n\napproximately 85.6 m and 602.8 m, respectively, which are close to the respective climatological\npressure levels of 89 \u00b1 6 dbar and 563 \u00b1 10 dbar, presented by Bil\u00f3 et al. (2014) between 23\u00b0S\nand 26\u00b0S. Further deeper we found the AAIW-UCDW interface approximately at 1157.2 m and the\nUCDW-NADW interface at ?1383.4 m.\n\nTable 2.2: Mean depths of water mass interfaces and their associated standard deviations calculated\nfrom the CERES IV and CARBOM set of 170 CTD profiles.

The\ncolor scheme indicates the observed water masses following the ?0 interfaces described by M\u00e9mery\net al. (2000) [TW-SACW = 25.60, SACW-AAIW = 26.90, AAIW-UCDW = 27.38, UCDW-NADW\n= 27.53].\n\nIn Figure 2.6, we present the cross-sectional velocity distribution at the transect 24S. During the\nCERES IV cruise (upper panel) the BC is depicted as the south-southwestward flow (negative veloc-\nities) in the upper 500 m (TW and SACW domain), with maximum surface velocities of ?-0.45 m s?1\nover, approximately, the 1300 m isobath. Note that offshore the 2010 m isobath there is an other near\nsurface velocity maximum of -0.22 m s?1. This second core is clearly depicted in Figure 2.2 at 100\n\n16\n\n\n\nm (panel a). Since the BC and IWBC are described in the literature as currents with velocity pattern\ndecaying from their cores (e. g., Evans and Signorini, 1985; Silveira et al., 2004; Bil\u00f3 et al., 2014),\nwe considered that the BC signal is confined between 180 m and 2010 m isobaths with a width of\n?61 km. Considering the cited dimensions and boundaries for the BC, we estimated its cross-section\nvolume transport to be ?-4.20 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3 s?1 ).\n\nUnderneath the BC, the IWBC flows north-northeastward (positive velocities) with maximum ve-\nlocities of approximately 0.14 m s?1, a vertical extent of 1000 m (mostly in the AAIW and UCDW\nlayers) and width of ?46 km, if we consider as horizontal boundaries the 800 m and 2000 m isobaths.\nIts volume transport was estimated to be approximately 1.81 Sv, which is almost half of the 3.6 \u00b1\n0.8 Sv estimated by Silveira et al. (2004) at ?23\u00b0S and the 4.11 \u00b1 2.01 Sv at 26\u00b0S presented by Bil\u00f3\net al. (2014). These estimates were calculated from the velocity profiles measured by the Pegasus\nprofiler3 and the LADCP, respectively. In that sense, we should draw attention to the southwestward\nflow offshore from the 2010 m isobath at intermediate depths (500-1500 m depth), which has a ve-\nlocity core of maximum velocities around 0.12 m s?1 at the same depth (?800 m) of the IWBC\u2019s core.\nIts cross-section volume transport is approximately -2.34 Sv and if we add the 1.81 Sv from the IWBC\nto that, we have 4.15 Sv, which is a value much closer to the estimates from Silveira et al. (2004) and\nBil\u00f3 et al. (2014), suggesting that part of the intermediate flow could be recirculating over the Santos\nPlateau during the CERES IV. Legeais et al. (2013) temporally averaged the float derived velocity\ndata series in 1\u00b0x 1\u00b0 boxes and computed the eddy kinetic energy (EKE). The mean vectors indicate\na southwestward flow offshore from the IWBC at Cape Frio. Moreover, the maximum EKE over the\nplateau also suggests the presence of such recirculation.\n\nAt waters deeper than 1500 m (NADW domain) there is negative velocity signal over the 2010 m to\n2649 m isobaths and isolated from the intermediate velocity signal by the isotach of 0.05 m s?1. Bil\u00f3\net al. (2014) speculated that a similar signal found at 26\u00b0S could be part of the DWBC. However due\nto the limited observations available more investigation is necessary to confirm this observation.\n\nDuring the CARBOM cruise (Figure 2.6, lower panel) we observe a BC that vertically extends\ndown to 700 m and horizontally extends from the 662 m to 2243 m isobaths (?52 km). Note that the\nBC velocity signal seems to be incomplete and part of the current is offshore to the 2243 m isobath. In\nfact, if we go back to the Figure 2.2 (panel b) we can verify that the BC actually extends offshore to\nthe 2300 m isobath with a width of ?75 km. Its maximum velocities of -0.86 m s?1 are at the surface\nand over the 1535 m isobath.\n\nSimilarly to the CERES IV intermediate flow, the IWBC from the CARBOM cruise is right below\nthe BC, however its maximum velocities are at 1200 m depth and reach 0.29 m s?1. There are also\nsmall differences concerning the dimensions of the current, which has a vertical extent of approxi-\nmately 900 m (750-1650 m) and a width of ?39 km (1124-2243 m isobaths). This more energetic\nstate of BC system observed during the CARBOM cruise also is reflected in the cross-section vol-\nume transport of -9.21 Sv and 2.50 Sv for the BC and IWBC respectively. We should mention that a\nsouthwestward flow at depths higher than 1600 m, over the 1915 m and 2243 m isobaths, was also\nobserved.\n\nAt transect 25S (Figure 2.7) we present good examples of the BC system meandering activity.\n\n3The direct velocity measurements presented by Silveira et al. (2004) were first described by Evans and Signorini\n(1985).\n\n17\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Cross-sectional velocity distribution at transect 24S from the CERES IV (upper panel)\nand the CARBOM cruises (lower panel). Negative velocities are south/southwestward. The stars\nindicate the locations of the CTD-LADCP profiles, and the circles represent the positions of the stations\nwhere only CTD profiles were taken. The numbers indicate the isobaths along the transect.\n\nAs mentioned before, the BC is meandering over the continental shelf during the CERES IV cruise\n(upper panel), so we extended the velocity analysis to part of the shelf (117 m isobath). Note that the\nsouthwestward flow supposedly related to the BC signal is limited to the upper 250 m of the water\ncolumn between the 159 and 1856 m isobaths. As expected in this kind of scenario, the maximum\nvelocities (>0.30 m s?1) are over the continental shelf, however probably due to an interaction with\nshelf currents and/or the modification of the velocity signal by different forcing factors such as winds,\nthe BC does not present the parabolic-shape. The BC volume transport offshore to the shelf break\n(159-1856 m isobaths) was estimated in approximately -2.79 Sv, which differs in -1.41 Sv from we\nestimated at 24S. Integrating the velocity over regions shallower than 159 m we obtained a transport\nof ?-1.55 Sv.\n\nBetween 250 m and 1250 m depth, we observe two distinguishable positive (north-northeastward)\nvelocity cores. The core that flows over the 685 m to 1686 m isobaths characterizes the IWBC, with\n\n18\n\n\n\nmaximum velocities at 960 m of approximately 0.18 m s?1, vertical and horizontal extent of 1000 m\nand ?30 km respectively, and a volume transport around 1.86 Sv. Further offshore the other velocity\ncore at the AAIW domain also has maximum velocities of ?0.18 m s?1, however it is placed right above\nthe 750 m depth and has a cross-section transport of ?3.18 Sv. Note that the IWBC transport estimative\nis only 0.05 Sv higher than the volume transport at 24S, which supports the idea that the flow close to\nthe topographic boundary crosses the 25S and 24S transects while other portion recirculates offshore,\nover the Santos Plateau. Moreover, the south-southwestward flow at the NADW layer (depth>1383.40\nm) is also present at transect 25S.\n\nIn contrast, the BC observed during the CARBOM cruise (Figure 2.7, lower panel) flows south-\nsouthwestward over the shelf break vicinities (140 m isobath) to the continental slope bottom (?2018\nm isobath) with a width of 100 km in the upper 500 m. With maximum surface velocities of approx-\nimately -0.80 m s?1 placed over the 333 m isobath, BC volume transport was estimated in -9.82 Sv.\nAt intermediate depths (500-1750 m), it is possible to observe that the flow crosses the 25S transect\nequatorward, however no IWBC velocity core signal is noticeable due to the angle between the actual\ncurrents and the transect. In that sense most of the AAIW volume transport seems to occur along the\ntransect, so we did not computed the cross-section transport component.\n\nFigure 2.8 depicts the magnitude of the velocity measured during the CARBOM cruise at transect\n25S. Note that if we combine it to the cross-sectional velocity distribution presented in Figure 2.7, we\nare able to identify the velocity core related to the IWBC and speculate about its dimensions. At depths\nbetween 500 m and 750 m, there is a velocity maximum of 0.25 m s?1 over the 1836 m isobath, which\nseems to be the IWBC velocity core. It is important to mention that there is no other significant velocity\nintensification closer to the continental slope topography and the velocity magnitude is in agreement\nwith the IWBC maximum velocities found at transect 24S, which suggests that the IWBC is displaced\noffshore and closer to the surface than at 24S. The comparison between the positive velocities area\nin Figure 2.7 (lower panel) and the 0.10 m s?1 isotachs from Figure 2.8 suggests that the IWBC is\nflowing over the 605 m to 2018 m isotachs which corresponds to a width of approximately 60 km,\nand has a vertical extent of 1000 m. It is worth to mention that the velocity intensification at the most\noffshore LADCP profile (2204 isobath) and depths greater than 1500 m (>0.20 m s?1) is placed where\nwe expect to observe the flow that might be related with part of the DWBC.\n\n19\n\n\n\nXXXX\n\nFigure 2.7: Similar to Figure 2.6 but for the transect 25S.\n\n20\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Velocity magnitude at transect 25S from the the CARBOM cruise. The stars indicate the\nlocations of the CTD-LADCP profiles, and the circles represent the positions of the stations where only\nCTD profiles were taken. The numbers indicate the isobaths along the transect.\n\nIn Figure 2.9 we present the cross-sectional velocity distributions at transect 26S. The data obtained\nduring the CERES IV cruise (upper panel) were described in detail by Bil\u00f3 et al. (2014). The BC is\nwell defined in the upper 500 m and between the 284 m and 2156 m isobaths. The parabolic-shaped\ncurrent is centered over the 635 m isobath, has maximum surface velocities of approximately -0.59\nm s?1, width of 85 km and consequently a volume transport of -5.75 Sv. At intermediate depths,\nthe IWBC is depicted between the 635 m and 2156 m isobaths, and the depths of 500 m and 1800 m\nwhich indicate a current with a width of 60 km and a vertical extent of 1300 m. The IWBC is centered\nover the 1845 m isobath, its maximum velocities are approximately 0.22 m s?1 at the depth of 970 m\nand volume transport is ?4.11 Sv. As mentioned earlier, Bil\u00f3 et al. (2014) argued that the negative\nvelocity signal at the NADW domain could be part of the DWBC over the Santos Plateau.\n\nThe lower panel of Figure 2.9 depicts the BC system observed during the CARBOM cruise. Note\nthat in the first 700 m of the water column the velocity signal inversion over the vicinities of the\n1738 m isobath indicates the presence of a cyclonic eddy similar to the one reported by Campos et al.\n(1995) from geostrophic computations. Its coastal lobe is limited by the 235 m and 1738 m isobaths,\nwhich indicates a width of ?50 km, has maximum velocities of approximately 0.38 m s?1 located\nover the 600 m isobath and at the 250 m depth level, has a volume transport of 4.49 Sv. The oceanic\nlobe has a width of 70 km (1738-2657 m isobaths), with maximum velocities of -0.58 m s?1 located\nover the 2120 m isobath and at the 50 m depth level, and its volume transport is approximately of\n-5.52 Sv. Therefore the BC net cross-sectional volume transport is ?-1.03 Sv.\n\nThe IWBC from the CARBOM cruise is depicted by the well defined positive velocity signal be-\ntween 750 m and 1750 m depth, and over the 1196 m and 2114 m isobaths. This current has a vertical\nextent of 1000 m, width of ?35 km, maximum velocities approximately 0.27 m s?1 place over the\n\n21\n\n\n\n1196 m isobath and the 1125 m depth level, and volume transport ?3.01 Sv. We should stress out\nthat there is a important gap of data between 424 m and 1196 m isobaths, which might had lead us to\nunderestimate the IWBC dimensions and volume transport. These isobaths are approximately 24 km\napart.\n\nFigure 2.9: Similar to Figure 2.6 but for the transect 26S.\n\nWe conclude this section extending our analysis to the CARBOM transects to the south of the\nSantos Bifurcation (?27\u00b0S). In Figure 2.10 we present the cross-sectional velocity distribution at\ntransect 29S. As observed in Figure 2.2, the whole water column over the continental slope seems to\npresent the velocity signal of a cyclonic meander of the BC. Note that its oceanic lobe (over 1490-\n2046 m isobaths), or the primary axis of the BC, has two prominent velocity cores: the one associated\nwith the BC in the upper 500 m and maximum velocities of -0.37 m s?1; and the intermediate flow\n(500-1500 m) associated with the southern branch of the Santos Bifurcation and maximum velocities\nof ?-0.32 m s?1. Although we are not able observe the entire poleward flow in the transect, we can\nestimate its horizontal dimension of approximately 70 km based on the velocity signals presented on\nFigure 2.10 and infer that the lobe is centered over the 1900 m isobath. Additionally, the maximum\n\n22\n\n\n\nvelocities of the upper and intermediate cores are placed at 125 m and 900 m depth respectively.\nThe coastal lobe signal is well defined from the surface to 1000 m depth and between isobaths of\n\n436 m and 1490 m (width ? 55 km). Moreover, it has one velocity core with maximum velocities\nof 0.32 m s?1 at the depth of approximately 600 m and over the 931 m isobath. Unfortunately it is\ndifficult to evaluate what is the exactly development stage of the meander from one velocity transect,\nunless the temporal evolution of the meander is well known, nonetheless the presence of only one\nsignificant velocity maximum suggests that the perturbation that originates the meander starts growing\nat intermediate depths. Mano et al. (2009) reported a similar behaviour during the the development\nof a cyclonic meander at 23\u00b0S from PE numerical modelling results.\n\nWe also computed the volume transport of each lobe by integrating the velocity over the area\nlimited by the cited spacial boundaries in the previous paragraphs. The coastal lobe has a transport of\napproximately 4 Sv and the oceanic one -13.16 Sv, which indicates a BC system net volume transport\nof -9.16 Sv. Then, if we compare the -13.16 Sv with the -5.52 Sv, which is the BC oceanic lobe\ntransport at the transect 26S, we can conclude that the Santos Bifurcation is responsible for an increase\nof approximately 7.64 Sv in the BC poleward transport during the CARBOM cruise. Note that the\n-7.64 Sv is higher than the IWBC transport of 3.01 Sv at transect 26S, which suggests that ?30% of\nthe total amount of water (7.64 Sv + 3.01 Sv = 10.65 Sv) that is splitted by the Santos Bifurcation\nflow north with the IWBC corroborating the Legeais et al. (2013) geostrophic estimates.\n\nFigure 2.10: Cross-sectional velocity distribution at transect 29S from the CARBOM cruise. Negative\nvelocities are south/southwestward. The stars indicate the locations of the CTD-LADCP profiles, and\nthe circles represent the positions of the stations where only CTD profiles were taken. The numbers\nindicate the isobaths along the transect.\n\nFinally, Figure 2.11 depicts the velocity distribution at transect 30S. Note that the BC and the\nintermediate flow are organized in a single velocity core extending down to 1000 m and width of\n?100 km. The maximum velocities of approximately -0.52 m s?1 are placed over the 550 m isobath\nat ?90 m depth level. Additionally, the volume transport integrated over the area horizontally limited\n\n23\n\n\n\nby the isobaths 184 m and 1960 m, and the surface and 1300 m depth was estimated in approximately\n-11 Sv.\n\nFigure 2.11: Similar to Figure 2.10 but for the transect 30S.\n\nIn order to summarize the downstream changes of the BC, we present the primary characteristics\nof the current in Table 2.3. The first noticeable characteristic is that the BC was more energetic to\nthe north of the Santos Bifurcation during the CARBOM cruise, due to the larger dimensions and the\nhigher velocities of the current. Secondly, the eddy characteristics to the north and to south of the\nSantos Bifurcation are clearly distinct. The transect 29S shows the intermediate flow of the AAIW and\nUCDW (500-1500 m) recirculating with the the upper flow of the TW and SACW (0-500 m), which does\nnot occur at transects 25S (CERES IV) and transect 26S (CARBOM). At the last two transects, the\nperturbations of the BC and the IWBC seems to behave more independently. Finally, the BC experiences\nan increase in the volume transport as it flows poleward, except at transect 30S, due to the reasons\nalready discussed.\n\nTable 2.3 also indicates that the BC transport increase between transects 24S and 26S is due by\na different reason than the increase between transects 26S ans 29S. As mentioned before the Santos\nBifurcation is responsible for an increase of ?7.64 Sv to the BC between transects 26S and 29S, and\ntherefore due to the BC vertical thickening. However, Table 2.3 shows no evident vertical thicken-\ning between transects 24S and 26S, instead a significant widening is observed as it flows poleward.\nRocha et al. (2014) argued based on mooring records at 22.7\u00b0S and 25.5\u00b0S that the BC also thickens\nsouthward, although at a smaller rate than at the Santos Bifurcation area. However the authors did\nnot considered the relative position of the mooring lines to the BC core and the topographic changes.\nRocha et al. (2014) argued that the mooring at 25.5\u00b0S is closer to the BC core than the other, which\nsuggests that even if the BC reaches the same depth at both locations their analysis would indicate a\nthicker current at 25.5\u00b0S due to its parabolic-shape. Moreover, to the north of the Santos Plateau area\n(23\u00b0S-28\u00b0S) the continental slope steepness is shaper, which means that the IWBC tends to flow right\n\n24\n\n\n\nunderneath the BC in this area and displaced offshore to the south of 24\u00b0S (e. g., Rocha et al., 2014;\nBil\u00f3 et al., 2014), since the IWBC is highly constrained by the slope topography (Boebel et al., 1999;\nLegeais et al., 2013).\n\nTable 2.3: Primary characteristics of the BC cross-sectional velocity signal at each transect.\nTransect Width (km) Thickness (m) Maximum velocity (m s?1) Transport (Sv)\nCERES IV\n24S 61 500 -0.45 -4.20\n25S* - 250 - -\n26S 85 500 -0.59 -5.75\nCARBOM\n24S 75 750 -0.86 -9.21\n25S 100 500 -0.80 -9.82\n26S** 120 700 0.38 | -0.58 4.49 | -5.52\n29S** 125 1500 0.32 | -0.37 4 | -13.16\n30S 100 1300 -0.52 -11\n\n*Due to the BC meandering over the shelf we were not able do estimate its dimensions and total transport\n**Presence of a cyclonic meander: width represents the diameter of the meander; and we present the maximum velocities\nand volume transport observed in each lobe.\n\n2.3 Linear instability analysis\n\nIn order to relate the BC downstream changes described in the previous section with the properties of\ngeophysical instabilities, and answer the guiding questions we performed numerical experiments. We\nopted for a linear instability sectional model that was already applied for similar purposes in other\nwestern boundary currents. The PE frontal instability model created by Moore and Peltier (1987) was\nadapted by Xue and Mellor (1993) to study the Gulf Stream instability in the South Atlantic Bight.\nJames et al. (1999) employed the same model to investigate the dynamics of the Kuroshio Current in\nEast China Sea. They reduced the parameter space and optimized the numerical code performance.\n\n2.3.1 The Model\n\nThe model uses PE linearized around a background state. This background consists of a velocity\nfield V (x , z ), its associated buoyancy field B (x , z ) (Equation 2.1) and a topography profile h(x ). The\ncoordinate system is given by: x cross-stream, y downstream and z vertically upward from the sea\nsurface.\n\nB (x , z ) = ?g??(x , z )\n?0\n\n, (2.1)\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity, ??(x , z ) is the background density field and ?0 is the refer-\nence density. The PE in terms of the background state are shown in Equations 2.2 to 2.6.\n\n25\n\n\n\n(\n?\n\n?t\n+ V ?\n\n?y\n)u ? f v + 1\n\n?0\n\n?p\n\n?x\n= 0 (2.2)\n\n(\n?\n\n?t\n+ V ?\n\n?y\n)v + f u + u ?V\n\n?x\n+ w ?V\n\n?z\n+ 1\n?0\n\n?p\n\n?y\n= 0 (2.3)\n\nb ? 1\n?0\n\n?p\n\n?z\n= 0 (2.4)\n\n?u\n\n?x\n+ ?v\n?y\n\n+ ?w\n?z\n\n= 0 (2.5)\n\n(\n?\n\n?t\n+ V ?\n\n?y\n)b + u ?B\n\n?x\n+ w ?B\n\n?z\n= 0, (2.6)\n\nwhere u, v , and w represent the x, y and z components of the perturbation velocity; p is the per-\nturbation pressure; b is the perturbation buoyancy; t is time; and f the Coriolis parameter. Then the\nnumerical solutions for the instability problem are obtained by using a rectangular domain with the\nboundary conditions presented by Equation 2.7 and the vertical stretched coordinate system defined\nin Equation 2.8.\n\n????????\n???????\n\nu = 0 a t x = 0\np, u and v ? 0 a t x ? ?\nw = 0 a t z = 0\nw = ?u ?h\n\n?x a t z = ?h(x )\n\n(2.7)\n\n? = 1 + z\nh(x )\n\n, (2.8)\n\nconsequently we can redefine the velocity vertical component in the new coordinated system as\n\n? = w ? (?? 1)u ?h\n?x\n\n. (2.9)\n\nThe numerical model is built using the transport forms of u, v and b (Equation 2.10) and the\ndimensionless form following Equation 2.11.\n\n(u?, v ?, b?) = (uh, v h, bh) (2.10)\n\n(x?, y ?) = (x , y )\nL0\n\n, t ? = t f , h? = h\nH0\n\n, (u?, v ?) = (u\n?, v ?)\n\nu0 H0\n, ?? = L0\n\nH0\n\n?\n\nu0\n,\n\np? = p\n?0u0 f L0\n\n, b? = b\n?\n\nu0 f L0\n, B ? = B\n\nH0 N\n2\n0\n\n, V ? = V\nV0\n\n,\n(2.11)\n\nwhere L0 is horizontal length scale, H0 is the maximum depth, u0 is the typical perturbation velocity\nscale, N 20 is the maximum vertically averaged\n\n?B\n?z and V0 is the maximum value of V .

The studied perturba-\n\ntions are assumed to be oscillatory with a downstream propagation of the form\n\nu = Re [u?(x ,?)e i (?t+?y )] (2.17)\n\nv = Re [i v? (x ,?)e i (?t+?y )] (2.18)\n\n? = Re [??(x ,?)e i (?t+?y )] (2.19)\n\nb = Re [i b?(x ,?)e i (?t+?y )] (2.20)\n\np = Re [i p?

In order to build the eigenvalue problem, the perturbation amplitudes (u?,v? , ??, b?\nand p? ) were decomposed into a Fourier series using a spectral technique (Equations 2.22 to 2.30).\n\nu? =\n??\n\nV =0\n\n??\n?=0\n\nu?V EV ??

V ) to make the\nproblem numerically solvable. When the truncation level (N ) and ? are specified, the model solves\nthe problem for ? (eigenvalues) and for the truncated series coefficients (eigenvectors). The detailed\nimplementation of the spectral model is given by Xue and Mellor (1993) and James (1996).\n\n2.3.2 The background states parameterization\n\nThe first, and most important, step in preparing the model is to define the background, or basic state.\nThe background state can be thought as a transect where the cross-sectional velocity distribution\n[V (x , z )] are \u201cnot perturbed\", or closest to a mean state. In that sense, we selected from our data set\nthe velocity transects that resemble the probable mean state of the BC system reported in the literature.\nUnfortunately there is neither observational work that described the mean full velocity structure of\nthe BC system, nor a data base which could allow us to estimate it. Hence, we based the choice of the\ntransects on the position of the velocity core and maximum velocities. Other authors have dealt with\nthe same issue in investigating the stability of other western boundary current systems. Johns (1988)\nused Pegasus velocity profiles and geostrophic calculations to obtain his profile. James et al. (1999)\nopted to use a geostrophic quasi-synoptic transect instead of a mean state inferred geostrophically\nfrom an inverted echosounder array, in order to keep the velocity lateral shear.\n\nIt is well known that the inshore boundary of the BC is well-marked by a surface thermal front\n(Garfield, 1990; Silveira et al., 2008; Lorenzzetti et al., 2009). The sea surface temperature imagery\nanalysis carried out by Garfield (1990) and Silveira et al. (2008) show that the mean BC thermal\nfront is located around the 200 m isobath between 23\u00b0S and 30\u00b0S. Therefore we should look for the\nscenarios where the BC inshore boundary is placed in the vicinities of the shelf break. Moreover,\nconsidering such scenarios, historical and recent observations depict the BC with maximum velocities\nranging from 0.3 to 0.7 m s?1 (e. g., Evans and Signorini, 1985; Campos et al., 1995; Silveira et al.,\n2001, 2004; Oliveira et al., 2009; Rocha et al., 2014).\n\nSince we intend to evaluate the Santos Bifurcation impact on the instability processes and, con-\nsequently, the role of the vertical shear, we should also take into account the intermediate flow, es-\npecially to the north of 27\u00b0S. The Lagrangian floats analysis carried out by Boebel et al. (1999) and\nexpanded by Legeais et al. (2013) comprises the best assessment of the mean characteristics of the\nIWBC until now. In a mean term the IWBC\u2019s width does not exceed 100 km, its core is placed approx-\nimately 20 km from the 800 m isobath at ?800-1000 m depth, and the maximum velocities can reach\n?0.30 m s?1.\n\nWe therefore concluded that the transects 24S and 26S from CERES IV cruise, and the transect 30S\nfrom the CARBOM cruise are the most adequate velocity distributions to be used in the instability\n\n28\n\n\n\nanalysis. Moreover this set of transects clearly exampled the BC downstream changes (see Table\n2.3). From now on, these transects will be referred as transects 24S, 26S and 30S for simplicity,\nrespectively.\n\nFor initializing the model, we defined analytical representations of the chosen cross-sectional ve-\nlocity distributions and topography. We carried out this procedure for two reasons. First, the gradients\nof topography and velocity (horizontal and vertical) required to solve the stability problem can be\nfound without finite difference errors. Secondly, we can easily change the background characteristics\nby altering the functions parameters, in order to perform sensitivity experiments.\n\nThe set of equations which describes the parametric model is directly based on the models proposed\nby Luther and Bane (1985), James et al. (1999) and Schmidt et al. (2007) (Equations 2.31 to 2.34).\nThe model is function of the distance from the inner continental shelf x and the depth z. All the\nunspecified parameters were determined via non-linear least square fitting in which the root-mean-\nsquare (RMS) difference between the analytical velocity field V (x , z ), the topographic profile h(x ), and\nthe observations was minimized. We used Equation 2.31 to represent the different topography profiles\nin each numerical experiment. Moreover, two distinct parametric models were used to represent the\nvelocity field to the north and to the south of the Santos Bifurcation. To the north of the bifurcation\n(24S and 26S), we defined the BC system (Equation 2.32) as the sum of the BC and IWBC signals\n(V (x , z ) = Vbc + Vi w bc ).\n\nh(x ) = Hs +\n1\n\n2\n(Hd ? Hs )[1 + t anh(\n\nx ?

(2.33)\n\nThe velocity pattern to the south of the Santos Bifurcations (30S) was defined by the sum of three\nexponentials functions [V (x , z ) = Vu +G1 +G2] given by Equation 2.34. After the least square fitting\nwith the observations, the background buoyancy fields [B (x , z )] were obtained by numerically inte-\ngrating the thermal wind relation from the offshore boundary to the coastal boundary of the domain.\n\n29\n\n\n\nThe most offshore CTD-LADCP hydrographic profile, in each transect, was used to calculate the B (x , z )\nprofile as boundary condition for the integration.????????????\n\n???????????\n\nVu (x , z ) = Vc 0e x p ( ?z\n2\n\nZ 2s\n)e x p (?[ x?(X c 0?p )\n\n`\n]2)\n\nG1(x , z ) = G10e x p (?[ z?G1ZG1Z s ]\n2)e x p (?[ x?G1XG1L ]\n\n2)\n\nG2(x , z ) = G20e x p (?[ z?G2ZG2Z s ]\n2)e x p (?[ x?G2XG2L ]\n\n2)\n\n(2.34)\n\nWe should mention that the model domain is larger than the real transect. It is desirable for the\nhorizontal density gradient (???(x ,z )\n\n?x ) and V (x , z ) to decay to zero at the lateral boundaries, therefore\nwe set the domain width to be large enough to ensure the fronts isolation from these boundaries. In\naddition, we wanted to keep the continental shelf and slope proportional to the real features. The grids\nwere built with 103 horizontal points and 200 vertical levels.\n\nTopography parameterization\n\nIn panel a of the Figure 2.12, the topography parameterization of the transect 24S is depicted. Observe\nthat the analytical function for h(x ) reproduce well the steepness of the continental slope, however the\ndepths near the shelf break are over-estimated. The chosen exponential form of the model (Equation\n2.31) does not allow us to perfectly fit the shelf-break and slope steepness at the same time. Moreover,\nit is important to mention that the BC system is centred around the ?1300 m isobath, which corre-\nsponds to the middle of the slope, and just the BC\u2019s coastal lobe edge is near the shelf break (Figure\n2.6, upper panel). In that sense, based on Xue and Mellor (1993) and James et al. (1999) findings\nwith the same model, we should expect the disturbances to be more influenced by the slope steep-\nness. Nevertheless we are aware that the shelf break depth has an impact on the stability properties\nof the BC. James et al. (1999) results regarding their shallower shelf experiment (KSD 50) suggest that\na shallower shelf break may increase the \"stiffness\" (resistance to meandering), which would favour\nthe development of shorter-period oscillations.\n\nIn contrast, the higher difference between observations and the model for transect 26S is located at\nthe most offshore station (Figure 2.12, panel b). This station is located more than 100 km far from the\nBC and IWBC cores (Figure 2.6, upper panel), thus it will not represent a problem. Further south, the\nfunction proposed for the topographic profile in transect 30S (2.12, panel c) reproduced well all the\nobserved characteristics. Additionally, we compared the models with the 1 arc-minute global relief\nmodel of Earth\u2019s surface (ETOPO 1), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\nThis data set integrates land topography and ocean bathymetry and it is built from numerous global\nand regional data sets (Amante and Eakiins, 2009). Note that the models have limitations, nevertheless\nthey reproduce well the topographic features at each transect.\n\nVelocity parameterization\n\nWe considered a suitable model for the background state, the analytical functions which produced\ngood a representation of the observed velocity distribution, cross-sectional volume transport, vertical\n\n30\n\n\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 2.12: Parameterization of the topographic profiles (solid line) at transects (a) 24S, (b) 26S\nand (c) 30S.

To make this assessment we discussed the results presented in Figures\n2.13-2.16. Figure 2.13 presents the observed cross-sectional velocity distributions (upper panels) and\nthe respective models V (x , z ) (lower panels); Figure 2.14 depicts the absolute velocity difference\nbetween the observations and the parametric models; and Figures 2.15 and 2.16 show comparisons of\nthe resulting vertical and horizontal velocity shears of the BC and IWBC respectively.\n\nAt transect 24S (Figure 2.13, panels a), the model was able to reproduce the dimensions, position\nand shape of BC system velocity cores (e. g., Section 2.2.2). The BC flows to the southwest in the\nupper 400-500 m with maximum surface velocities of approximately -0.45 m s?1 and a width of ?70\nkm. At intermediate depths, the IWBC is depicted flowing northeastward with maximum velocities\nof approximately 0.13 m s?1, a vertical extent of 1000 m and width of ?50 km. Consequently, the\nmodel also performed well in estimate the volume transport, since it generated a BC transporting -3.74\n\n31\n\n\n\nSv and an IWBC with 1.72 Sv, which differ ?10% from the -4.20 Sv and 1.81 Sv estimated from the\nobservations for the BC and the IWBC respectively.\n\nWith the intent to visualize where the limitations of the proposed model are, we calculated the\nvelocity at the observations locations and subtracted it from the observed velocities (Figure 2.14). The\nabsolute velocity difference distribution at transect 24S (panel a) shows that the largest differences\n(0.1-0.22 m s?1) are located at the surface, but off the BC system area. In general, within the BC\nsystem domain, the differences are less than 0.05 m s?1. Note that there are smaller regions in the\narea of interest, where the absolute differences are larger than 0.05 m s?1, however these values are\nnot enough to mischaracterize the general velocity pattern.\n\nAdditionally we evaluated the vertical (?V\n?z ) and horizontal (\n\n?V\n?x ) velocity shears by comparing the\n\nvelocity profiles at the BC and IWBC cores (Figures 2.15 and 2.16). Because the velocity signal\nmeasured with the LADCP and VMADCP corresponds to the total water velocity, the velocity fields are\nnoisy and its associated shear might be difficult to interpret. In that sense we linearly interpolated\nthe observations, in both directions, and smoothed the resulting velocity distributions. This procedure\nallowed us to obtain smoothed velocity shear (horizontal and vertical) profiles associated with the BC\nsystem velocity signal, \u201cwithout\" smaller scale motions interference. It is important to mention that\nthe smoothing process did not change the maximum (and minimum) velocities and kept the transports\nof volume.\n\nNear Cape Frio (24S), the ?V\n?z and\n\n?V\n?x are presented by panels a in Figures 2.15 and 2.16 respec-\n\ntively. Note that the ?V\n?x was well reproduced by the model in the BC system domain, especially close\n\nto the coastal boundary (x ? 110 km). However it is seen, from the ?V\n?z profile that the model did not\n\nperfectly reproduce the velocity vertical structure. Although the current vertical dimensions, max-\nimum velocity and value of the maximum ?V\n\n?z are in agreement with the observations, the velocity\nvertical profile shape is slightly different. In the model, the velocity decays exponentially from the\nsurface [e x p ( ?zZs ) in Equation 2.32], however the observed profile shows that the maximum velocities\nextends down to ?100 m (low variation). In this case the maximum ?V\n\n?z is located between 200 and\n350 m.\n\n32\n\n\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 2.13: The observed cross-sectional velocity distributions (upper panels) and the respective parametrized velocity field (lower panels) at transect (a)\n24S, (b) 26S and (c) 30S. Negative velocities are south-southwestward, and the triangles indicate the locations of the CTD-LADCP profiles. The numbers\npresented with the model domain represent its physical boundaries.\n\n33\n\n\n\nThe same reasoning was applied in the analysis of the proposed models for the transects further\nsouth. At transect 26S (Figure 2.13, panels b), the model representation of V (x , z ) has the general\ncharacteristics of the observed field. The parametrized parabolic-shaped BC has a vertical extent of\n?570 m, maximum velocities of -0.50 m s?1, a width of the order ?100 km and a transport of ap-\nproximately -5.93 Sv. These values are in a good agreement with values presented in Table 2.3.\nAt intermediate depths, the parametrized (observed) IWBC is depicted flowing northeastward with a\nmaximum velocity of approximately 0.20 m s?1 (0.22 m s?1), a vertical extent of 1,700 m (1,800 m)\nand a volume transport ?4.51 Sv (4.11 Sv). As pointed out by Bil\u00f3 et al. (2014), the large distance\nbetween the most offshore stations (56 km), does not allow us to precise the IWBC\u2019s horizontal di-\nmension, however its signal is well defined between x ? 100 and 160 km. In that sense the model has\nan adequate velocity horizontal decay coefficients.\n\nIn terms of absolute velocity differences between the observations and the model (Figure 2.14,\npanel b), the largest values (?0.10 m s?1) are restricted to the deep southwestward flow area, which\nis off the BC system domain (Figure 2.13, upper panel b). The velocity shear profiles (Figures 2.15\nand 2.16, panels b), present a similar limitation of the model at 24S. Because the velocity decays\nexponentially from the surface, the model was not able to reproduce the ?V\n\n?z peak at approximately\n420 m of depth.\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 2.14: Absolute velocity difference distributions between the observed and the parametric\nmodel at transect (a) 24S, (b) 26S and (c) 30S. The black triangles indicate the locations of the\nCTD-LADCP profiles.\n\nIn contrast to the transects 24S and 26S, there is no northward flow at intermediate depths in\nthe velocity measurements at transect 30S, which required us to change the parametric model in\n\n34\n\n\n\norder to better represent V (x , z ) (Equation 2.34). This model also had a good performance and well\nrepresented the position, dimensions, maximum velocities and volume transport of the BC.\n\nThe BC is depicted extending down to 1000 m depth and is, at least, 100 km wide (Figure 2.13,\npanels c). The parametrized (observed) maximum velocities reach 0.45 m s?1 (0.45 m s?1) and\nvolume transport is approximately 10.67 Sv (?11 Sv). Likewise the other transects, high errors (?0.10\nm s?1) are located off the BC area (Figure 2.14, panel c). Again the primary limitation of the model is\nrelated to the ?V\n\n?z (Figure 2.15, panel c). In fact, the model fails in reproducing the\n?V\n?z signal inversion\n\nat ?100 m due to the maximum observed velocity do not be located at the surface (?90 m), and its\npeak at z ? 450 m.\n\nDespite the limitations of using analytic functions to describe the cross-sectional velocity distri-\nbutions, we successfully build parametric models that yielded suitable representations of the general\ncharacteristics of the velocity observations. We must keep in mind that the BC system models were\ncompared with direct velocity measurements, which comprises signals of movements at different spa-\ntial and temporal scales. In that sense, we should be aware that details will be missed and not expect\nperfect velocity representations.\n\n35\n\n\n\nXXXX\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 2.15: Profiles of the BC horizontal (?V\n?x , left panels) and vertical (\n\n?V\n?z , right panels) velocity\n\nshears at transect (a) 24S, (b) 26S and (c) 30S.

The presented profiles are located at the IWBC velocity core.\nThe black dots indicate the locations of the CTD-LADCP profiles.\n\n2.3.3 Necessary conditions for instability and idealized experiments\n\nIn Section 2.1, we pointed out that different studies showed the BC is indeed baroclinicaly and\nbarotropicaly unstable along its path through the Santos Basin (23\u00b0S-28\u00b0S), however there is no study\nthat evaluated the effects of the mixed-instabilities in this region until now. Although, its expected\nboth kinds of instabilities occur simultaneously due to the presence of horizontal and vertical ve-\nlocity shears we tried to evaluate if our background states satisfy the necessary conditions for these\ninstabilities to develop. To accomplish that, we discuss the conditions based on the cross-sectional\ndistributions of the potential vorticity following Chen (1989) and James (1996). These authors com-\nputed the cross-sectional distribution of the potential vorticity for the Kuroshio Current.\n\nThe classic Ertel\u2019s theorem states, for a inviscid fluid, the total potential vorticity is expressed by\n\nQ = ?( f\n??\nk +?\u00d7??V )\n\n?\n\u00b7??, (2.35)\n\n37\n\n\n\nwhere f\n??\nk is the planetary vorticity, ?\u00d7??V is the relative vorticity and ?(p,?) is a scalar quantity that\n\nis conserved for each fluid element (i.e., d?d t = 0) (e. g., Pedlosky, 1987). Taking ? to be buoyancy, we\ncan rewrite Q (Equation 2.35) as the sum of the basic potential vorticity (q ) and the eddy potential\nvorticity (q?). The first is associated with the background states and the second with the perturbations.\nThe expression for q is given by Equation 2.36.\n\nq = ?0\ng B\n\n[( f0 +\n?V\n\n?x\n)\n?B\n\n?z\n? ?B\n?x\n\n?V\n\n?z\n]. (2.36)\n\nPedlosky (1964) showed that, in general, a necessary condition for mixed-instabilities occur is that\nV\n?q\n?x must be positive somewhere in the domain. In fact this condition is satisfied in the three back-\n\nground states built. Figure 2.17 clearly show the regions where V ?q\n?x > 0 in blueish colors.\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 2.17: Product of the velocity V and the cross-sectional gradient of the basic potential vorticity\n(?q\n?x ) in the background state at transect (a) 24S, (b) 26S and (c) 30S.\n\nSince our background states are expected to be unstable for both kinds of instabilities, and we\nwanted to evaluate what are the instability driving mechanisms and the effects of topography, we set\nsix idealized experiments in order to better answer our guiding questions. Besides the experiments\nusing the parametric models proposed for transects 24S, 26S and 30S we proposed three experiments\nwithout topography, or no slope steepness (24Sn t , 26Sn t , 30Sn t ), and three experiments without\ntopography and reduced horizontal velocity shear (24Sbc , 26Sbc , 30Sbc ).\n\nThe set of experiments without topography (index n t ) were built with the intent to quantify the\nstabilizing, or destabilizing, effect of the topography in the mixed-instabilities. These experiments\nwere built by altering the constants Hs and Hd from Equation 2.31. We set all experiments domain\n\n38\n\n\n\nwith a constant depth of 1000 m mainly for two reasons. The first reason is that transects 24S and\n26S have the BC system centred approximately over the 1000 m isobath. Secondly, we were able to\nkeep a good vertical resolution of 200 vertical levels without distorting the velocity and increasing\nthe computational time.\n\nIt is important to mention that keeping the original functions for V (x , z ) extrapolations of velocity\nand buoyancy fields under the original topography were done. However, our results show that no\nunreal new frontal regions were created and the perturbations were concentrated around the original\nsystems (see Appendices A and B). Although in experiment 30Sn t the current is centred over ?600\nm isobath, almost the entire BC was kept intact.\n\nThe experiments without topography and reduced horizontal velocity shear (index bc ) were per-\nformed to reduce as much as possible the perturbations growth due to barotropic instability (e. g.,\nPedlosky, 1987). As mentioned before, it is desirable for ???(x ,z )\n\n?x and V (x , z ) to decay to zero at the\nlateral boundaries, therefore we were not able to simply eliminate the horizontal structure of the back-\nground velocity field. We bypassed this problem by increasing the currents horizontal length scale L0\n(i.e., width) and consequently reducing the horizontal velocity shear. In order to reduce the bound-\nary effects we also increased the models domain in order to keep the original distance of the frontal\nregions from the lateral boundaries.\n\nIn the theoretical study of Killworth (1980), the author shows that for fluids with vertical and\nhorizontal shears, under the QG theory, the type of instability is defined by two basic parameters; the\nratio of L0 to the first internal deformation radius Rd 1 (?k w ), and the fractional depth of variation of\nthe stratification (?k w ). Likewise other western boundary currents (Gulf Stream and Kuroshio), the\nBC has a L0 two to four times larger than the internal deformation radius between 23\u00b0S and 30\u00b0S and a\n?k w&lt;&lt;1. At these limits, the author argues that one type of instability is easily isolated by changing\none of the parameters because the mixed-instability just occurs in a small number of combinations\nof ?k w and ?k w . In other words, if we increase ?k w the system will just allow baroclinic instability.\nIn that sense, we altered some parameters of the parametric models to generate current systems with\nwidths twice the size of the originals without altering the vertical velocity shears.\n\n2.3.4 Model Performance\n\nBefore describing the stability properties of each experiment it is important to mention that we first\ntested the model performance. James et al. (1999) pointed out that two important aspects of the\nmodel should be tested before performing the numerical experiments. The first aspect is the model\nconvergence to a solution, the second is the presence of an inconsistency in the buoyancy boundary\nconditions that could give rise to spurious growth rates, even in the absence of any forcing.\n\nThe model requires a truncation level N in order to make the instability problem numerically\nsolvable. A fundamental problem of such spectral models is to determine N so that the truncated\nsolution converges to the real one. Xue and Mellor (1993) showed that the model solutions converge\nfor increasing N and the convergence tends to be faster at larger wavelengths perturbations. So\nthe appropriate choice of N depends on the instability being studied (James et al., 1999). Based\non the previous knowledge about the instability processes of the BC, we decided to test the model\nconvergence for perturbations with wavelength between 10 km and 1000 km (10 km, 100 km, 200\n\n39\n\n\n\nkm, 500 km, 1000 km) using the background states from the experiments 24S, 26S and 30S.\nThe model is set to give us the eigenvectors u?V , v?V and b?V , and the eigenvalues ?. If the growth\n\nrates ??i , phase speeds c (c = ??r? ) and perturbations amplitudes [u?(x ,?), v? (x ,?) and b?(x ,?)] change\nless than 5% between consecutive N , the model is assumed to have converged. For the fields of the\nperturbations amplitudes the 5% criteria refers to the RMS difference. The tested N varied from 20 to\n46, resulting in the model convergence for N = 38 for all wavelengths and backgrounds tested. Based\non this result we decided to set our model with N = 40 for all the experiments performed in this work.\n\nThe second aspect is intrinsically related to the topography and resolution of the model. Using a\nmuch more complicated topography profile, James et al. (1999) performed a motionless experiment\n(no kinetic and potential energy sources) to see if spurious growth rates are generated. They obtained\nsmall growth rates compared to the realistic experiments. So we did the same test for transects 24S,\n26S and 30S. All the resulting growth rates are smaller than 10?3 day?1, therefore they are at least\none order of magnitude smaller than those obtained in the realistic experiments (see Section 2.3.5).\n\n2.3.5 Stability properties and energy pathway\n\nFor each experiment, the instability modes were calculated for a range of wavelengths spanning 10-\n1000 km, then we analysed the stability properties of the most unstable mode (fastest growth rate).\nAdditionally we discussed the relative importance of baroclinic and barotropic instabilities by com-\nparing three important energy conversion terms: mean kinetic energy (MKE) to EKE, or Reynolds\nstress (RS); mean potential energy (MPE) to eddy potential energy (EPE), or horizontal heat flux (HHF);\nEPE to EKE, or vertical heat flux (VHF). These terms were calculated following Xue and Mellor (1993)\nand are presented in Equations 2.37-2.39.\n\nRS = ?Ro\nh\n\n(u v\n?V\n\n?x\n+ v??V\n\n??\n) (2.37)\n\nHHF = [(?? 1)?h\n?x\n\n1\n\nh\n? ?B\n?x\n\n(\n?B\n\n??\n)?1]ub (2.38)\n\nVHF = ?b + (?? 1) 1\nh\n\n?h\n\n?x\nub, (2.39)\n\nwhere the overbars represent the averaging over a wavelength in the y -direction. These terms repre-\nsent the sources and sinks of eddy energies.\n\nBasically, the baroclinic and barotropic instabilities respectively drain MPE and MKE from the\nbasic state and transfer it to the perturbations or eddy field (e. g., Pedlosky, 1987). Therefore, we\ncan relate the rates HHF and VHF to the baroclinic instability, and RS to the barotropic instability\nprocess. Moreover, it is important to mention that not all the energy released from the mean flow,\nthrough instability processes, is used to feed the growth of the perturbations in the same region. In\nChen et al. (2014)\u2019s study, the authors quantified how much MPE and MKE released from the mean\nlarge-scale circulation, at different regions of the globe, locally contribute to the perturbations growth\n(local instability). Using their approach and our perturbation fields, we refined the energy pathway\nby comparing the eddy energies change rates (HHF and RS) with the mean energies change rates\n(Equations 2.40 and 2.41).\n\n40\n\n\n\n?\nA\n\n[(?? 1)?h\n?x\n\n1\n\nh\n? ?B\n?x\n\n(\n?B\n\n??\n)?1]ub ? ?\n\n?\nA\n??ub\n?x\n\nB (\n?B\n\n??\n)?1\n\nLocal baroclinic instability\n(2.40)\n\n?\nA\n?Ro\n\nh\n(u v\n\n?V\n\n?x\n+ v??V\n\n??\n) ? ?\n\n?\nA\n?Ro\n\nh\n(V\n?u v\n\n?x\n+ V ?v?\n\n??\n)\n\nLocal barotropic instability\n, (2.41)\n\nwhere A is the transect area.\nDue to the large number of experiments, we separated the discussion of the instability properties\n\nin four parts. In the first part, we compare the model results from the \u201crealistic\" experiments (24S,\n26S and 30S). In the other parts we discuss the relative importance of the different processes in the\nlinear instability problem at each transect by comparing the \u201crealistic\" experiment with the idealized\nones (n t and bc indexes).\n\nExperiments 24S, 26S and 30S\n\nAs expected, the BC system is indeed unstable at all the three transects locations. In Figure 2.18 we\npresent the growth rates (panel a) and phase speeds (right panel textbfb) as functions of wavelength\nof the most unstable mode. In the experiment 24S the most unstable wave (140 km) has a growth\nrate of 0.12 day?1, corresponding to an e-folding time scale (eT) of about 8 days. In the experiment\n26S, the BC system presents a most unstable wave (120 km) with growth rate of 0.19 day?1 (eT?5\ndays). Further downstream, experiment 30S, the growth rates are significantly smaller than in the\nexperiments 24S and 26S. The most unstable wave (130 km) has growth rate of 0.06 day?1 which\ncorresponds to a eT of approximately 17 days.\n\nThe phase speeds of these perturbations are -0.19, -0.24 and -0.26 m s?1, for experiment 24S, 26S\nand 30S respectively. Therefore, the steering levels [depths at which phase speed = V (x , z )] are all\nwithin the BC domain. The steering levels, considering the vertical velocity profiles that cross the BC\ncore, are approximately 207, 302 and 339 m in experiments 24S, 26S and 30S respectively.\n\nTwo important aspects of the curves presented in Figure 2.18 must be highlighted. The first aspect\nis the fact that the BC system becomes more unstable as it flows southwestward to the north of the\nSantos Bifurcation (?27\u00b0S). In contrast, as the current crosses the bifurcation the current becomes\nmore stable. This behaviour was also observed in the baroclinic instability analysis carried out by\nRocha et al. (2014), however their findings are directly related to the fact that the highest vertical\nvelocity shear is located at ?25\u00b0S and the smallest at ?28\u00b0S. In the present study the vertical velocity\nshear is higher in the experiment 24S (Figure 2.15), so we associated this fact with the barotropic\ninstability process.\n\nThe second aspect is that the BC to the south of the Santos Bifurcation is unstable for a fewer\nnumber of perturbations than the system to the north of the bifurcation. This was also observed by\nRocha et al. (2014) and Fernandes et al. (2009). The latter work numerical simulations showed that\nthe 430 km-long unstable waves has their amplitude decreased as the BC flows to the south of 25\u00b0S,\ntherefore the BC became stable for 430 km-long waves. The background state of the transect 30S\n\n41\n\n\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 2.18: (a) Growth rates and (b) phase speeds of the most unstable mode from the experiments\n24S, 26S and 30S. The black dots indicate the wavelength of the most unstable wave of each curve.\n\nis unstable for perturbations with wavelengths between 90 and 230 km. Rocha et al. (2014) also\ncalled attention to the possibility the baroclinic vorticity waves to the south of the bifurcation be\nshorter than in the northern part of the study region, however we did not find clear evidence of similar\ncharacteristic in our experiments.\n\nFigures 2.19, 2.20 and 2.21 present the amplitudes of the most unstable perturbations and the\nresulting energy conversion terms from each experiment. Note that the amplitudes and energy con-\nversion terms are dimensionalized. In order to estimate how much energy from the background state\nis transferred to eddy motions, we had to assume a horizontal velocity perturbation scale. We consid-\nered u0 = 0.1 m s?1, following Rocha et al. (2014).\n\nA noticeable characteristic of all \u201crealistic\" experiments is the confinement of the perturbations in\nthe upper 400 m of water column around the BC core, which is consistent with the fact that the BC\npresents a more vigorous mesoscale activity than the IWBC (e.g., Silveira et al., 2008; Rocha et al.,\n2014; Bil\u00f3 et al., 2014), moreover this also explain the southward phase speeds. James et al. (1999)\nassociated the changes of phase speeds of the most unstable waves in the Kuroshio Current with\nthe background velocity. They argued that, because the phase speeds changed, in percentile, a similar\namount than the background velocity in different experiments, the perturbation advection by the mean\ncurrent is the primary reason for the observed changes. Using the results of the experiment 24S as\nreference, the wavelength of the most unstable waves changed ?8% (16%) and the mean velocity,\nin the area where the perturbations are concentrated, changed ?30% (40%) when compared with the\nsame parameters from experiment 26S (30S). Since the correspondent phase speed is 26% (36%)\nhigher than the phase speed obtained in experiment 24S, the perturbation advection seems to be the\nprimary reason for the differences in the phase propagation.\n\nFrom b panels in Figures 2.19-2.21, it is clear that the current system is unstable for baroclinic and\nbarotropic instabilities (HHF>0, RS>0), as expected from the potential vorticity analysis. Moreover,\nthe baroclinic instability drains, in general, more energy from the background state than the barotropic\n\n42\n\n\n\ninstability (HHF>RS). In order to quantify the relative importance of each type of instability we\nintegrated the energy conversion terms over the transect area. To better illustrate the energy pathways\ninvolved in the proposed mixed-instability problem, we also built diagrams containing the integrated\nvalues of HHF, VHF and RS, and their efficiency in draining energy from the background state (Figure\n2.22). These energy diagrams are simplified versions of the energy pathways described by Chen et al.\n(2014) for different regions of the global ocean.\n\nThe integration of the energy terms from experiment 24S (Figure 2.22, panel a) show that the en-\nergy drained from the background state trough barotropic instability (0.14 kW m?1) is approximately\n14% of the energy drained trough baroclinic instability (1.03 kW m?1). Moreover, the VHF accounts\nfor 57% (0.59 kW m?1) of the HHF. Note that the instability processes in experiment 24S are pre-\ndominantly local, since approximately 70% of the MKE are transformed in EKE and HHF corresponds\nto only an increase of ?27% of the MPE released energy from a non-local source.\n\nAlthough the energy diagram of experiment 26S (Figure 2.22, panel b) presents similar values for\nHHF (0.98 kW m?1) and VHF (0.58 kW m?1) to the terms from experiment 24S, the RS (0.38 kW m?1)\nterm is ?2.6 times bigger. This implies that the most unstable wave is theoretically more efficient in\ndraining energy from the background state through barotropic instability. However this difference is\ndue the non-locality of the barotropic instability process. Nevertheless more energy are transformed in\nEKE due to barotropic instability at 26\u00b0S. This result is consistent with the drifter analysis of Oliveira\net al. (2009). The authors found that the RS at the surface is higher at ?26\u00b0S than at 24\u00b0S and 30\u00b0S.\n\nTo the south of the bifurcation (experiment 30S) the BC becomes larger and thicker, which means\nthe vertical and horizontal velocity shears decrease as it flows poleward (e.g., M\u00fcller et al., 1998). As\nconsequence the BC becomes more stable and less energy is drained from the background state and\ntransferred to the eddy field (Figure 2.22, panel c). The energy terms HHF, VHF and RS are 0.60, 0.43\nand 0.07 kW m?1, respectively and they are significantly smaller than those obtained from the other\n\u201crealistic\" experiments. Another interesting characteristic is that the barotropic instability accounts\nfor only ?11% of the energy transferred through baroclinic instability. Most of the energy, ?90%\n(64%) drained from the MPE (MKE) are used to support local growth.\n\n43\n\n\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 2.19: (a) Amplitudes of the perturbations fields ( u?(x ,?)H0 ,\nv?

The arrows with dashed tail indicate\nhow much energy are related with non-local instability processes.\n\nIdealized experiments 24Sn t and 24Sbc\n\nAfter discussing the differences between the \u201crealistic\" experiments we tried to isolate the topographic\nand barotropic instability effects by using the idealized experiments and comparing it to the \u201crealis-\ntic\" ones. The upper panels of Figure 2.23 present the growth rates and the phase speeds of the\nexperiments 24S, 24Sn t and 24Sbc . At a first glance, a significant impact of the topography and\nthe horizontal velocity shear on the stability properties can be inferred from the different dispersion\ncurves.\n\nThe flat topography (24Sn t ) was responsible for an increase of 25% in the maximum growth rate\n(0.15 day?1, or eT?6 days). In opposition to that, when the width of the currents are doubled (24Sbc )\nthe system becomes more stable and the 190 km-long waves are the most unstable ones with maxi-\nmum growth rates of 0.06 day?1 (eT?16 days). In both idealized experiments the phase speeds are\npositive and very small (?0.05 m s?1), which correspond steering levels located close to the BC-IWBC\ninterface (?500 m). Therefore, the idealized background configurations with significant decreased\nstiffness favoured longer period oscillations (T = 8.53, 20.83 and 44.98 days for 24S, 24Sn t and\n24Sbc respectively), which corroborate James et al. (1999) results for the Kuroshio behaviour.\n\n47\n\n\n\nIn Section 2.1 we mentioned that in the literature the most unstable waves that emerge from baro-\nclinic instability analysis and using QG theory, are 200-400 km-long, quasi-stationary (small north-\nward phase propagation) and growth rates of 0.03-0.06 day?1 at ?23\u00b0S (Silveira et al., 2008; Rocha\net al., 2014). In that sense our stability analysis indicates that quasi-stationary waves might be gen-\nerated by the usage of constant topography or very low topography steepness. Silveira et al. (2008)\nand Rocha et al. (2014) indeed scaled the topography steepness by Ro = 0.10, which allowed the\nlonger period perturbations, of ?88.73 and ?51.31 days respectively, that extend to deeper regions\nof the domain to be the most unstable ones. Nevertheless Garfield (1990) reported few events when\nsuch waves were observed at Cape Frio relative to shorter faster growing propagating, which sug-\ngests that a different conformation of the BC system may favour the growth of these oscillations. It\nis worth to mention that the transect 24S is placed at the vicinities of the Santos Plateau, therefore\nthe topographic steepness between the 2000 and 3000 m isobaths is very smooth and may provide the\nadequate conditions for the quasi-standing meander growth happen when the BC is displaced offshore.\n\nSimilarly to the \u201crealistic\" experiments, we integrated the energy conversion terms over the transect\narea. The experiment 24Sn t yielded a HHF of approximately 0.74 kW m?1, VHF?0.03 kW m?1 and\nRS of approximately 0.37 kW m?1. These values suggest that, in the absence of topography, the\nbarotropic instability becomes more important for the instability process (50%) when compared with\nthe case with topography (14%).\n\nInterestingly the same energetic analysis of experiment 24Sbc revealed that we were able to reduce\nsignificantly the effects of the horizontal velocity shear and \u201cisolate\" the most baroclinic unstable\nwaves. The integration yielded a HHF of 0.29 kW m?1, VHF?0.01 kW m?1 and RS of 0.01 kW\nm?1. As expected this most stable scenario has perturbations with a low efficiency in draining energy\nfrom the background state and the barotropic instability corresponds to a small fraction (?3%) of the\ninstability process.\n\nIdealized experiments 26Sn t and 26Sbc\n\nThe idealized experiments at transect 26S provided interesting insights about the instabilities in the\nregion. In agreement with the idealized experiments 24Sn t and 24Sbc , when the topography is set to\nbe constant (26n t ) the most unstable wave (130 km) presents a growth rate (0.21 day?1, or eT?5 days)\napproximately 11% higher than in the \u201crealistic\" experiment (26S). Moreover, the reduced horizontal\nvelocity shear (26bc ) yielded longer unstable waves (max. of 300 km) with growth rates (0.04 day?1,\nor eT of 25 days) significantly smaller than in the other experiments (Figure 2.23, middle panel a).\n\nNote that the phase velocities (-0.24 and -0.19 m s?1) did not change much (Figure 2.23, middle\npanel b) and the steering levels remained around 300 m. As expected the no topography scenario\ndecreased the stiffness and favoured longer period waves to develop with 5.78, 6.27 and 18.27 days\nfor experiments 26S, 26Sn t and 26Sbc respectively. The latter value is consistent with period of\napproximately 16.92 days found by Rocha et al. (2014) at 25.5\u00b0S. Additionally, if we compare the\nresults from the experiments 26S and 26Sn t we can conclude that no large differences were found,\nwhich might be related to the fact that the BC be placed over a smoother topography than at 24S, and\nthe IWBC be offshore displaced due to the topographic profile.\n\nThe integration of energy conversion terms from experiment 26Sn t (26Sbc ) show a HHF approxi-\n\n48\n\n\n\nmately 0.55 kW m?1 (0.91 kW m?1), VHF? 0.02 kW m?1 (0.04 kW m?1) and a RS of 0.44 kW m?1\n(0.02 kW m?1). In that sense a similar scenario of experiments 24Sn t and 24Sbc is observed for\nexperiments 26Sn t and 26Sbc . Again in the experiment n t the barotropic instability becomes more\nimportant for the instability process (80%) and was considerably reduced in the experiment 26Sbc\n( RS\n\nHHF\n=0.02).\n\nIdealized experiments 30Sn t and 30Sbc\n\nFinally, the idealized experiments 30Sn t and 30Sn t presented the most unstable waves with growth\nrates of 0.10 day?1 (eT = 10 days) and 0.02 day?1 (eT = 50 days), respectively. Again we were able\nto observe the stabilizing effect of the topography and the decreasing of the growth rates when the\nhorizontal velocity shear is reduced. The phase speeds of the most unstable waves are -0.23 m s?1, so\nthe steering level increased in approximately 20 m (Figure 2.23, lower panels).\n\nAlthough the effects on growth rates of topography and horizontal velocity shear seem to be similar\nto the north and south of the Santos Bifurcation, the instabilities contributions change radically from\nthe idealized experiments to the north of the bifurcation. The term HHF from 30Sn t (0.33 kW m?1)\ndecreased in 50%, however in experiment 30Sbc HHF increased significantly and reached 1.91 kW\nm?1, due to the BC\u2019s large horizontal dimensions. Again, in contrast to the experiments 24Sn t and\n26Sn t , the RS term from 30Sn t decreased (0.01 kW m?1) and is approximately only 3% of the HHF.\nThis relative loss of importance was reported by Xue and Mellor (1993) when experiments, of the\nGulf Stream at the South Atlantic Bight, with topography and flat bottom were compared. The VHF\nterms are 0.01 and 0.09 kW m?1 in experiments 30Sn t and 30Sbc , respectively.\n\n49\n\n\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 2.23: (a) Growth rates and (b) phase speeds of the most unstable mode from the numerical\nexperiments at transect 24S (upper panels), 26S (middle panels) and 30S (lower panels).

The mixed-instability properties and its relation with the downstream changes\nof the BC system were addressed based on the description of a set of quasi-synoptic transects and the\napplication of a PE frontal instability model, linearized around a background state chosen based on\ndirect velocity observations.\n\nThe quasi-synoptic velocity observations revealed that the BC is ?400-500 m deep, although can\nreach deeper regions depending on its energetic state, to the north of the Santos Bifurcation (?27\u00b0S)\nand extends down to 1000 m to the south of it. We estimated that the BC receives at least 7 Sv at\nintermediate depths from the Santos Bifurcation, which drastically alters the velocity patterns and\neddies characteristics as it flows poleward.\n\nThe background states correspond to analytical functions (parametric models) that describe the\nobserved cross-sectional velocity distribution of the BC system at different latitudes. In that sense,\nwe proposed two different set of analytic functions that described satisfactorily the general aspects of\nthe BC system to the north and south of the Santos Bifurcation. It is important to mention that this\nwork is not the first study to do so. Schmidt et al. (2007) were the first authors to propose a sectional\nparametric model for the BC system, however their model is restricted to the BC between 20\u00b0S and\n24\u00b0S. We generalized their model and proposed functions that can easily be adapted to represent the\nBC at different latitudes. We then performed different numerical experiments in order to answer the\nfollowing guiding questions. Table 2.4 summarizes the main results from the numerical experiments.\nAs we stated in Section 2.1, we aimed to answer three questions that guided this work. The questions\nand our answers are:\n\n(1) What are the differences between the instabilities to the north and to the south of the\nSantos Bifurcation ? Our experiments 24S, 26S and 30S show that the BC system is more unstable\n(0.10 &lt;??i &lt;0.20 day?1) and the instability waves propagate phase downstream with slightly smaller\nvelocities (c &lt;0.26 m s?1) north of the Santos Bifurcation (23\u00b0S-27\u00b0S). This is consistent with the\nsatellite imagery from Garfield (1990) and the numerical simulations from Campos et al. (2000) and\nFernandes et al. (2009). Moreover, the barotropic instability seems to be more efficient in draining\nenergy from the background state at 23\u00b0S-27\u00b0S, corroborating Oliveira et al. (2009) results.\n\nThese changes in the stability properties and energetics of the perturbations are also in agreement\nwith the meanders characteristics observed in the quasi-synoptic data set. Since the BC meandering\nactivity is more independent from the IWBC than the upper 500 m flow is from the intermediate one\nat 28\u00b0S-30\u00b0S, the meanders can grow faster and project themselves over the continental shelf to the\nnorth of the bifurcation.\n\n(2) What are the instability driving mechanisms ? In the scope of the temporal linear instability\ntheory, our results corroborate the baroclinic instability analysis from Silveira et al. (2008) and Rocha\net al. (2014). These authors showed that the eigenstructures of the most unstable mode resembles\nthe eigenstructures of the primary variability modes from currentmeter mooring lines, indicating that\nthe baroclinic instability is the main cause of the mesoscale activity in the region. We found that the\nbaroclinic instability is the primary mechanism for the transference of mean-to-eddy energy (HHF>RS,\nTable 2.4).\n\n51\n\n\n\nDespite that, the growth rates from experiments 24S, 26S and 30S are at least twice the magnitude\nof those found by Silveira et al. (2008) and Rocha et al. (2014). The answer seems to rely on the\nhorizontal velocity shear (barotropic instability). From a first inspection of Table 2.4 we can conclude\nthat higher growth rates are related to higher ratios RS\n\nHHF\n. When the baroclinic instability was \u201cisolated\"\n\nthe wavelengths and growth rates became more comparable to their findings. Therefore our numerical\nexperiments suggests that barotropic instability has a significant impact on the instability process in\nthe study region.\n\n(3) What are the effects of topography changes ? From the experiments performed in this work,\nit is not clear the real impact of the topography differences in the instability process. Nevertheless our\nexperiments without topography provided us interesting insights about the the presence of it in the\nanalysis. In general the topography profiles have a stabilizing effect, however the BC current instability\nhave different response to the absence of topography to the north and to the south of the bifurcation.\nThe ratio RS\n\nHHF\nincreased when the topography is flat to the north of the bifurcation (experiments 24Sn t\n\nand 26Sn t ). In addition we must stress that the BC flows over the continental slope with a high\nsteepness, therefore the usage of QG models is very limited and it may be not adequate for the region.\n\nOther observable topographic effect relies on the difference in the results from experiments 24Sn t\nand 26Sn t when compared to the experiments 24S and 26S respectively. The flat bottom experiment\n26n t does not comprise drastically changes as the 24Sn t , which suggests that the gentler continental\nslope at 26\u00b0S constrains less the BC meandering.\n\nTable 2.4: Stability properties and energy conversion terms HHF, VHF, RS integrated over the transect\narea of the different numerical experiments.

We truly believe that our anal-\nysis provided important information about the BC system downstream changes and its relations with\nthe eddy formation processes by evaluating the linear instability characteristics and energetics. Al-\nthough PE models outputs may be difficult to interpret, we were able to perform different experiments\nin order to isolate the dynamics of each process and get useful insights about it.\n\nAdditional investigation has to be done towards the understanding of the processes involved in\nthe BC eddy motion. Particularly to this study, the lack of information on the BC dynamics did not\nallowed us to quantitative evaluate if the linear instability reasonably predicts the real features present\nin the BC meandering activity. Another open question is how much our transects are close to the mean\n\n52\n\n\n\nscenario of the BC system. Unfortunately, the available observations are few and sparse in space and\ntime. We are also aware that the full instability problem cannot be accounted for by linear models and\npredictions of eddy development and propagation should be investigated from observations and more\ncomplex models (e. g., Ni, 1996; Flierl, 1999; Oliveira et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2014).\n\n53\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Brazil Current cyclonic meandering at\n27\u00b0S-31\u00b0S: water mass composition, vertical\nstructure, surface signature and formation\nfrequency\n\nAbstract\n\nAt the vicinities of the Cape Santa Marta (28\u00b0S), Brazil Current (BC) cyclonic meanders have been\nreported through sea surface temperature (SST) satellite images as recurrent features. Because these\neddies were little explored in the literature, basic characteristics as their full velocity structure and\nrecurrence were unknown. Here we use a range of observations to provide an overview of such fea-\ntures as well as the relations between its velocity patterns, the water properties (temperature, salinity,\nnutrients), chlorophyll-a distribution and the BC variability. Top-bottom quasi-synoptic velocity mea-\nsurements depicted cyclonic meanders over the continental slope with diameters larger than 100 km\nand vertically extending to approximately 1500 m depth. Moreover, the observed eddies seems to\ntrap and recirculate a small portion (?1.5 to 4 Sv) of the BC main flow (-13.16 to -17.89 Sv), which is\nconsisted of TW, SACW, AAIW and UCDW. Additionally, we presented observational evidence that the\nmeanders actively influence the transport of nutrients rich shelf waters to the open ocean enhancing\nthe primary productivity at the photic zone over the continental slope. Satellite imagery show that\nthese cyclones occur 5-6 times per year and are generally associated with wave-like perturbations on\nthe flow with mean wavelength of ?219 km. Finally, Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) analysis\nwere computed from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) array of mooring lines (Hogg\net al., 1999) and showed that more than half of the along-isobath velocity variance on the continental\nslope is explained by the BC mesoscale activity.\n\nKeywords: Brazil Current variability, Cape Santa Marta, mesoscale activity, shelf-open ocean\nexchanges.\n\n54\n\n\n\n3.1 Introduction\n\nThe Brazil Current (BC) experiences strong mesoscale activity from its genesis site (?15\u00b0S) to the\nBrazil-Malvinas confluence (?39\u00b0S) over the continental shelf break and slope (Signorini, 1978; Leg-\neckis and Gordon, 1982; Garfield, 1990; Campos et al., 1995; Oliveira et al., 2009; Soutelino et al.,\n2013). At the vicinities of the Cape Santa Marta (28\u00b0S), BC cyclonic meanders and eddies with ap-\nproximately 100 km of diameter have been reported through sea surface temperature (SST) satellite\nimages as recurrent features related to vorticity waves which propagate phase downstream (e. g.,\nGarfield, 1990; Campos et al., 1996). Because these eddies were little explored in the literature, basic\ncharacteristics, such as the recurrence of such features remains unknown.\n\nGeostrophic computations (Zemba, 1991), Lagrangian float trajectories (Boebel et al., 1999) and\ncurrentmeters mooring lines (M\u00fcller et al., 1998) show that the BC vertically thickens as it crosses\nthe latitudes of ?27\u00b0S. The thickening is related to the incorporation of the Antarctic Intermediate\nWater (AAIW) flow between 500 m and 1500 m of depth, over the continental slope to the BC poleward\nflow, known as the southern branch of the Santos Bifurcation. The M\u00fcller et al. (1998) and Rocha\net al. (2014) moored currentmeters statistical analysis showed that the velocity standard deviations of\nthe intermediate flow are comparable to the north and south of this feature. However, it is almost half\nof the standard deviations in the upper 500 m, which suggests less variability deeper than 500 m. It is\nnot clear yet how dynamically coupled the intermediate flow is with the BC above it and how would\nthe velocity pattern at such depths be during a BC cyclonic meander event.\n\nHere we describe some basic characteristics of the cyclonic meanders near 28\u00b0S and provide obser-\nvational evidence of its role in shelf-slope mass exchanges. We do that by describing the top-bottom\nvelocity patterns of the BC during two distinct cyclonic meanders events and associating it with the\nwater masses; surface temperature, salinity, nutrients (silicate, ammonium, nitrate, phosphate) and\nchlorophyll-a distributions. To accomplish this task, we used two quasi-synoptic data sets, an array\nof four moorings and satellite imagery (Figure 3.1).\n\nThe first quasi-synoptic data set is comprised by three transects of oceanographic stations obtained\nin November of 2013 (11/18 - 11/23). The data are part of the INCT-CARBOM experiment, which\naims to study carbon fluxes in the Brazilian continental margin. During the CARBOM cruise, vertical\nprofiling by Conductivity, Temperature and Depth (CTD), lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler\n(LADCP), vessel-mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (VMADCP) as well as Niskin bottle water\nsamples were taken. The second quasi-synoptic data set consists of 12 CTD-LADCP stations and\nVMADCP profiles obtained in November of 2003 (11/07 - 11/11) during the MR03-K04 Leg 4 cruise\n(hereafter MR03) from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). The mooring lines used\nin this work are the ACM12/333, ACM12/334, ACM12/335 and ACM3/906 also from the WOCE\n(M\u00fcller et al., 1998; Hogg et al., 1999). They are equipped with conventional rotary currentmeters\nand ADCPs.\n\n55\n\n\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 3.1: (a) The data set explored in this study. The circles (triangles) represent the locations of\nthe CTD-LADCP stations of the CARBOM (MR03-K04 Leg 4) cruise and the diamonds the positions\nof the mooring lines.(b) CARBOM stations and its respective identification numbers. The large red\nnumbers are the transects identification and corresponds to the respective mean latitudes.\n\n3.2 The meanders vertical and horizontal structures\n\n3.2.1 Velocity patterns and water masses\n\nTo shed light on the velocity structure of the cyclonic meanders at the vicinities of the Cape Santa\nMarta (28\u00b0S) we shall look at the top-bottom velocity observations from the CARBOM and MR03\ncruises. During the both surveys, velocity profiles at each station were obtained using a downward-\nlooking 300 kHz LADCP from RD Instruments. The data processing were carried out by following\nthe procedures described by Fischer and Visbeck (1993) and Visbeck (2002). Additionally, 75 kHz\nVMADCP measurements taken on the ship\u2019s route were processed using the processing software Com-\nmon Ocean Data Access System (CODAS) from the Currents Group of the University of Hawaii.\n\nFigure 3.2 depicts the cross-sectional velocity component and the water masses vertical distribu-\ntions at the transects that crosses the cyclonic meanders (MR03 and 29.2S). The TS Diagram overlaid\non the M\u00e9mery et al. (2000) climatological water masses interfaces (panel a) show the presence of\nthe Tropical Water (TW), South Atlantic Central Water (SACW), Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW),\nUpper Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW) and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). Note that the\nCARBOM cruise presents waters with salinities (S) lower than 36 at temperatures (T) higher than\n20\u00b0C. Studying the summer and winter water masses characteristics of the southwestern Atlantic\nshelf (28\u00b0S-40\u00b0S), Piola et al. (2000) showed that shelf waters with 33.5 &lt;S &lt;36.0 (T > 14\u00b0C) at\n?27-31\u00b0S result from the mixing between TW and the continental runoff, also know as the Subtropical\nShelf Water (STSW).\n\nThe panels b and c present the velocity distributions and the respective sectional distributions of\nthe cited water masses. The velocity panels consist of composites of the LADCP and VMADCP mea-\nsurements. Such procedure were carried out following Schott et al. (2005) to improve the horizontal\n\n56\n\n\n\nresolution in the upper 500 m of the water column. Note that we present two different scenarios of\nthe cyclonic meander during the MR03 and CARBOM cruises. The lower (higher) velocities of the\nmeander coastal (oceanic) lobe, or positive (negative) velocity signal over the upper (lower) continen-\ntal slope, from the MR03 suggest that data captured different stages of development of the meander\nphenomenon.\n\nThe panel b from Figure 3.2 depicts the meander coastal lobe with velocities lower than 0.10 m\ns?1 over the upper slope. The northeastward velocity signal is horizontally limited by the stations 624\nand 627, indicating a horizontal and vertical extent of approximately 55 km and 1250 m, respectively.\nThe total amount of water that is crossing the transect in the coastal lobe is approximately 1.50 Sv\n(1 Sv = 106 m3 s?1). Further offshore, the whole water column (surface-2500 m) between stations\n628 and 632 (110-202 km) flows southwestward. Note that this oceanic lobe has two distinguishable\nvelocity cores with maximum velocities of -0.60 m s?1 and -0.25 m s?1 at the surface (station 630)\nand at 1250 m depth (station 631) respectively.\n\nBy combining the velocity pattern to the sectional distribution of the water masses defined by the\nM\u00e9mery et al. (2000) climatological interfaces (Figure 3.2), and the Preu et al. (2013)\u2019s definition\nof UCDW and NADW based on neutral density (?) and S for the Argentine Basin: UCDW is placed\nwhere 27.75 &lt;? &lt;27.90, and NADW is placed where 27.90 &lt;? &lt;28.10 and S ? 34.8 PSU; we\nwere able to associate the flow sense of each water mass. The oceanic lobes observed during both\nsurveys transports TW and SACW in the upper 500 m, AAIW at ?500-1200 m, UCDW at approximately\n1200-1500 m and NADW near the bottom at depths greater than 1500 m.\n\nExcluding the NADW of the volume transport computation, the MR03 oceanic lobe transports ap-\nproximately -17.89 Sv, which is comparable to the -22.8 Sv estimated by Zemba (1991) at 31\u00b0S from\ngeostrophy. In that sense, the BC system has a net cross-sectional volume transport of ?-16.89 Sv. If\nwe incorporate the NADW flow to the volume transport it becomes approximately -27 Sv, which is 2.3\nSv greater than the -24.7 Sv from Zemba (1991) estimate.\n\nAlthough the water mass circulation pattern during the CARBOM cruise is similar to the pattern\nobserved during the MR03 cruise, the meanders have significant differences. The coastal lobe pre-\nsented in panel c from Figure 3.2 shows a well defined velocity signal from the surface to 1000 m\ndepth between stations 129 and 126 (width ? 55 km). Moreover, it has one velocity core with maxi-\nmum velocities of 0.32 m s?1 at the depth of approximately 600 m. Similarly to the MR03 cruise, the\noceanic lobe (stations 126 and 123) has two prominent velocity cores: one with maximum subsurface\nvelocities of approximately -0.37 m s?1; and other at intermediate depths with maximum velocities\nof ?-0.32 m s?1.\n\nWe also computed the volume transport of each lobe by excluding the NADW flow. The coastal\nlobe has a transport of approximately 4 Sv and the oceanic one -13.16 Sv, which suggests that ?-9.16\nSv should be crossing the 29.2S transect poleward. Observe that the BC was partially sampled only\nduring the CARBOM cruise, nevertheless we obtained comparable transport for the BC to the values\nobtained from the MR03 data.\n\nIn an attempt to expand our description of the cyclonic meanders, we used the VMADCP and LADCP\nmeasurements from the all three CARBOM transects to map the horizontal structure of this feature. In\nthat sense we objectively mapped the stream functions (?) at different depths following Gille (2003).\nThe mapping procedure uses Gaussian covariance functions that satisfy geostrophic continuity and\n\n57\n\n\n\nincorporates error estimates on the data to produce a mapping error (Bretherton et al., 1976). Based\non the transects spacing and the VMADCP and LADCP errors we used an isotropic decorrelation scale\nof 1.2\u00b0 (?130 km) and a data fractional error (e) of 0.1.\n\nFigure 3.3 presents the streamlines at 30 m (near surface level), at 700 m and the respective nor-\nmalized error maps (em a x =0.22). Both maps show that the transect 29.02S does not crosses the\ncenter of the eddy structure, which seems to be located south (center of maximum ?). The mapped\ncyclonic meander exceeds 100 km of diameter likewise we estimated in the sectional velocity distri-\nbution. Moreover, we speculate that the offshore northward flow seen at 30 m depth might be part of\nthe BC recirculation cell (Vianna and Menezes, 2011).\n\nNote that we omitted the presence of a layer of low salinity (STSW) in the first ?50-70 m in the\nFigure 3.2 (panel c) description. The STSW plume extends to more than 150 km from the 100 m\nisobath and can be tracked by the 36 isohaline. In that sense, we linearly interpolated the salinity at\ndifferent depths to compare it with the near surface stream lines maps. The S=36 line at 30 m (Figure\n3.3, panel a) reasonably follows the internal edge of the oceanic lobe, corroborating the ? mapping\nand indicating that the low salinity distribution is associated with the meander.\n\n58\n\n\n\nXXXX\n\n(a)\n\n(b) (c)\n\nFigure 3.2: (a) Scattered TS Diagram overlaid on the M\u00e9mery et al.

(2014) performed a series of numerical simulations that showed the vicinities of 28\u00b0S\nas a spot of shelf-open ocean mass exchange. Based on their results, the authors argued that the ex-\nportation of the shelf waters to the open ocean are strongly associated with the BC mesoscale activity.\nIn fact the data from CARBOM cruise, described in the previous section, indicate that we captured\nsuch interaction between the BC and shelf waters with STSW entrained in the vortical feature. As that\nbeing the case we should try to better describe this phenomena and evaluate its possible impacts in\nthe oceanic water properties.\n\nThe cyclonic meander signature is well depicted by the salinity distributions in Figure 3.4. The low\nsalinity tongue crosses the shelf break and reaches the 2000 m isobath, which corresponds to distances\nhigher than 150 km away from the 100 m isobath. As expected, once the the water is trapped in the\ncenter of a cyclonic eddy (low pressure center) the surface waters tend to be pushed downward in the\nwater column due to the surface convergence (Cushman-Roisin and Beckers, 1994). Note that stations\n126 and 127 are the only locations where the STSW penetrate at depths of ?70 m (panels c and d).\n\n60\n\n\n\nWe mentioned in Section 3.1 that the BC cyclones near Cape Santa Marta were originally reported\nfrom SST satellite imagery. However we think surface temperature may not be always a good tracer\nfor detecting the cyclones due to the lack of thermal contrast between shelf and BC waters. By re-\nexamining the TS Diagram (Figure 3.2, panel a) and the TS profiles (3.4, panel d) we observe that\nthe temperature variations near surface are very small compared to S variations in all CTD stations\n(?1.5\u00b0C).\n\nAnother important shelf-slope mass exchange aspect to be verified is the wind influence. Its well\nknown that the wind is the primary forcing agent of the circulation in the southern portion of the\nBrazilian continental shelf (23\u00b0S-34\u00b0S). Additionally the northeasterly winds play an important role\nin the exportation of surface water to the open ocean and in the shelf-break upwelling system (Campos\net al., 2000; Castelao et al., 2004; Palma et al., 2004, 2008; Matano et al., 2010). Thus, we carried\nout a simple assessment of the Ekman transport based on 9 days of sea surface winds (11/13/2013-\n11/21/2013). The wind data are from the daily NCDC/NOAA Blended Seawinds L4 product avail-\nable in http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov, that combines different satellite measurements to resolve multi-\ntemporal and spatial scales phenomenon.\n\nFigure 3.5 shows the sea surface winds vectors and magnitude from 5 days before the start of the\nCARBOM cruise to the end of the transect that crossed the meander. In the time period 11/13 to 11/17\nthere are to shifts in the winds directions, probably associated with cold fronts that are common in this\nregion. From 11/18 (cruise start) to 11/20 the northeasterly winds became persistent and considerably\nintense (?10 m s?1). The approximately 72 h of such winds are enough to impose an important\noffshore Ekman transport at the surface, since the inertial period (Ti ) is around 25.5 h.\n\nIn that sense, we believe that the STSW distribution observed during the CARBOM cruise resulted\nfrom a combination of the winds action and the presence of the cyclonic meander. The clear meander\nsignature in the salinity data also suggests that once the water is captured by the meander, it remains\ntrapped and the water particles become locked in the BC path (e. g., Matano et al., 2014).\n\n61\n\n\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 3.4: Horizontal salinity distributions at (a) 10 m, (b) 30 m and (c) 70 m depth. Panel (d) presents the temperature and salinity profiles from\ntransect 29.02S where the STSW is present. The numbers x and d represent the distance from the 100 m isobath and local depth respectively.\n\n62\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Daily sea surface winds distributions for the period between 11/13/2013 and 11/21/2013.\nThe wind data are from the daily NCDC/NOAA Blended Seawinds L4 product.\n\nTo conclude this section, we shall see which are some consequences of the STSW offshore transport\nin some nutrients distributions and primary productivity. Unfortunately the available data set did not\nallowed us to study it in a quantitative manner, nevertheless our snapshots provided evidences regard-\ning these impacts. Figure 3.6 presents the concentrations of silicate, phosphate, nitrate, ammonium\nand chlorophyll-a at 5 m depth for the CARBOM cruise. The concentrations were obtained from\nwater samples collected and analysed following the procedures described by Grasshoff et al. (1983)\nand presented values are in agreement with the values expected for STSW and TW waters presented by\nBraga et al. (2008) and Piola et al. (2008).\n\nComparing the nutrients distributions with the 36 isohaline, the meander signature is clear in all\nmaps of Figure 3.6 with exception in the nitrate distribution (panel c). Note that the shelf waters richer\nin nutrients are trapped close to the eddy center (stations 125 and 126) and the coastal lobe, while the\noligotrophic oceanic waters follow the BC main axis offshore to the S=36 line. Another interesting\ncharacteristic is that the maximum concentration of all nutrients are not located at the same regions\nas the maximum of primary productivity associated with the higher concentration of chlorophyll-a\n(stations 128, 129 and 130). This might suggest that the shelf waters are trapped long enough to have\nits nutrients content depleted by the organisms in higher productive regions of the meander.\n\n63\n\n\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\n(d) (e)\n\nFigure 3.6: Distribution at 5 m depth of the concentration of (a) silicate, (b) phosphate, (c) nitrate, (d) ammonium and (e) chlorophyll-a.

The dots indicate where CTD profiles and water samples were taken.\n\n64\n\n\n\n3.3 The Brazil Current variability and cyclones recurrence\n\nIn the previous sections we showed the BC cyclonic meanders water mass patterns, physical dimen-\nsions and its possible role in the shelf-slope mass exchanges. However two important questions\nremain open: (1) How often the cyclonic eddies occur at the vicinities of Cape Santa Marta? and (2)\nHow much do these features account for the BC variability?\n\nWe saw from the literature and our analysis that the meanders not only present a signature in\nthe SST but also in the chlorophyll-a distribution. Thus, to answer the first question we analysed\n12 years (June/2002 - June/2014) of L4 satellite imagery from two different products, the daily\nMulti-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) SST Analysis (http://podaac-opendap.jpl.nasa.gov/) and the\n8-day composite Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor aboard of the Aqua\nsatellite (http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/). As expected, distinguishable cyclonic eddy events were\nfound in both sets of images between 27.5\u00b0S and 30\u00b0S. However only 16 independent events (?1.3\nevents year?1) were observed in the SST images while 66 events (?5.5 events year?1) were registered\nin the sea surface chlorophyll-a imagery (see example in Figure 3.7).\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 3.7: Same cyclonic meander event captured by the (a) daily SST and (b) 8-day composite\nsea surface chlorophyll-a satellite L4 images from MUR and MODIS respectively. The grey line and\ndots demarcate two consecutive peaks of the supposed vorticity wave shown by the thermal and\nchlorophyll-a fronts.\n\nThe 50 events discrepancy has two reasons. The low thermal contrast between shelf and open\nocean waters in some of the events, and the frequent large cloud covering of the region. Since we are\ndealing with an objectively mapped daily SST product, when the cloud coverage of the sky is large,\nthe SST distributions become fuzzy and therefore the fronts can not be observed. Nevertheless, the 16\nevents found simultaneously in the both products presented wave like fronts with a mean wavelength\n\n65\n\n\n\nof 219 km and standard deviation of 46 km. In Figure 3.7 we present one of the 16 events and its\nrespective temperature and chlorophyll-a fronts. Its important to mention that no clear signal of eddies\nthat detached from BC were observed.\n\nQuestion (2) was addressed using the WOCE mooring lines array. These currentmeters time series\nwere extensively explored in the literature and had its velocity signal already discussed (e. g., M\u00fcller\net al., 1998; Hogg et al., 1999; Rocha et al., 2013, 2014). In that sense we reproduced Sato (2014) by\ncomputing the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) of the time series velocity array to characterize\nthe subinertial variability of the BC (Figure 3.8). To compute only the BC subinertial oscillations, each\ncurrentmeter time series was low-pass filtered using a Lanczos squared filter with a 40 h cut-off (e.\ng, Emery and Thomson, 2001). We also rotated the velocity vectors in 30\u00b0 clockwise to obtain the\nvelocity component normal to the mooring array axis, which represents the component approximately\nparallel to the 200 and 1000 m isobaths. Rocha et al. (2014) showed that this is the BC preferential\nflow direction in the region. Moreover the EOF were computed only for the common time period to\nall velocity records (01/05/1991 - 11/25/1992).\n\nThe mean cross-sectional velocity values (Figure 3.8, panel a) show part of the BC signal in the\nupper 1000 m over the continental slope. The positive velocity signals in the upper 500 m and at\ndepths greater than 3000 m are related to the BC recirculation cell and the Antarctic Bottom Water\nflow respectively (M\u00fcller et al., 1998; Hogg et al., 1999).\n\nA Monte Carlo simulation indicate that only the first two EOF modes are statistically significant at\nthe 95% level (Preisendorfer, 1988). The first EOF (Figure 3.8, panel b), which explains 54% of the\nvariance, clearly represents the mesoscale oscillations of the BC. The spatial structure of this mode\nhas the highest values in the BC domain. Additionally, the energy spectrum show that the time series\nof the first mode is dominated by oscillations with periods of approximately 26 days. Therefore the\nmesoscale oscillations, such as the BC meanders, explains approximately half of the variability over\nthe continental slope near the Cape Santa Marta. The second EOF explains approximately 30% of the\nvariance and seems to be related to the BC recirculation cell (Figure 3.8, panel c). Its spatial structure\nis essentially confined in the upper 500 m of the water column and is centred on the recirculation area.\nThe second mode time series is dominated by large scale oscillations with periods of ?103 days, i. e.,\nthe main variability mode of the BC recirculation is seasonal.\n\n3.4 Summary and conclusions\n\nWe described the basic characteristic of the BC cyclonic meanders near Cape Santa Marta (28\u00b0S). A\nwide range of observations were used to provide a rich overview of the meanders and the relations\nbetween its velocity patterns and water masses circulation; surface temperature, salinity, nutrients and\nchlorophyll-a distributions; and the BC current variability.\n\nThe top-bottom quasi-synoptic velocity measurements depicted cyclonic meanders over the con-\ntinental slope with diameters larger than 100 km. Moreover the eddies presented velocity signal\nextending to approximately 1500 m depth, which highlights the dynamical coupling of the upper 500\nm flow with the intermediate one (500-1500 m). The observed BC eddies seems to trap and recirculate\na small portion (?1.5 to 4 Sv) of the BC main flow (-13.16 to -17.89 Sv), which is consisted of TW,\nSACW, AAIW and UCDW. Additionally, we presented observational evidence of the influence of the\n\n66\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 3.8: Summary of the EOF analysis of the mooring lines array from the WOCE Experiment for\nthe time period 01/05/1991 - 11/25/1992 (Hogg et al., 1999).

The gray dashed lines represent the mooring lines.\n\ncyclonic meanders in the shelf-open ocean exchanges. The salinity horizontal distributions combined\nwith the nutrients concentrations led us to conclude that the BC meanders actively influence the STSW\n\n67\n\n\n\ntransport to the open ocean (e. g., Matano et al., 2014), enhancing the primary productivity at the\nphotic zone over the continental slope.\n\nFrom satellite imagery, the cyclonic meandering of the BC is generally associated with a wave-\nlike perturbation on the flow with mean wavelength of ?219 km, corroborating the Garfield (1990)\nfindings. Moreover, the sea surface chlorophyll-a imagery analysis was more efficient than the SST\nanalysis in determining the meander recurrence. We estimated that independent cyclonic features\nmay occur 5 to 6 times per year off Cape Santa Marta. Finally, our EOF analysis computed from\nan array of mooring lines equipped with currentmeters show that approximately half of the variance\non the continental slope is explained by the BC mesoscale activity. Therefore almost 55% of the BC\nsubinertial variability is related to its meandering in this region.\n\nWe should stress out, however, that this study was not able to quantitatively address some important\npoints related to the cross-shelf exchanges and its biological impacts due to the limitation of the\nobservations. Future observational programs and modelling efforts should seek quantify the relative\nimportance of the wind forcing and smaller scale processes (e. g., submesoscale) compared to the\nmesoscale.\n\n68\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nFinal remarks\n\nIn this work we investigated the characteristics of the BC and its meanders at 23\u00b0S-31\u00b0S, and how\nlinear instability properties of this current system change north and south of the Santos Bifurcation in\nthe presence of vertical and horizontal velocity shears. Combining high-quality observations with a\nnumerical model we confirmed thesis hypotheses.\n\nUsing observational and numerical perspectives, we addressed in Chapter 2 the mixed-instability\nphenomenon and its relation with the downstream changes of the BC system. Quasi-synoptic velocity\nobservations revealed that to the north of the Santos Bifurcation (?27\u00b0S) the BC is ?400-500 m deep,\nalthough can reach deeper regions depending on its energetic state. Its important to stress out that the\nvolume transport increases southward at 23\u00b0S-27\u00b0S though, and seems to be related to its width and\nvelocity getting larger downstream. To the south of the bifurcation the BC extends down to 1000 m.\nWe estimated that the BC receives at least 7 Sv at intermediate depths from the Santos Bifurcation,\nwhich drastically alters its velocity patterns and eddies characteristics.\n\nBased on our numerical experiments with a PE linear instability model, we concluded that the\nBC system is more unstable (0.10 &lt;??i &lt;0.20 day?1) and the instability waves propagate phase\ndownstream with slightly weaker velocities (c &lt;0.26 m s?1) at 23\u00b0S-27\u00b0S. Additionally we were\nable to quantify the relative importance of the barotropic and baroclinic instabilities by comparing\nthe mean to eddy energy conversion terms. We found that the baroclinic instability is the primary\nmechanism (>60%) for the perturbations growth along the BC path. However the barotropic instability\nhad a significant impact on the linear instability properties being more important in draining energy\nfrom the mean currents to the north of the bifurcation.\n\nFinally were not able to address the real impact of the topography differences in the instability\nprocess and therefore further investigation is required. Nevertheless our experiments showed that the\ntopography has a stabilizing effect. In contrast to the system at 30\u00b0S, the relative importance of the\nbarotropic instability increased in the absence of topography to the north of 28\u00b0S. In addition, the\nBC flows over a high steepness continental slope, therefore the use of QG models is limited in not\nallowing a first order topographic effect.\n\nIn Chapter 3, we focused in the description of the basic characteristic of the BC cyclonic meanders\nnear Cape Santa Marta (28\u00b0S) using a wide range of observations. From two different quasi-synoptic\ndata sets, we corroborated the findings of Chapter 2 regarding the vertical velocity structure of the\nmeanders to the south of the Santos Bifurcation. Comparing cyclonic meanders at different stages of\n\n69\n\n\n\ndevelopment we found that the intermediate flow indeed meanders consonantly with the BC above it,\nindicating a dynamical coupling south of 27\u00b0S.\n\nThe satellite imagery showed the cyclonic meandering is generally associated with a wave-like\nperturbation on the flow with mean wavelength of ?219 km. Moreover, we found that the sea surface\nchlorophyll-a imagery analysis was more efficient than the SST analysis in detecting the meander\noccurrence (5 to 6 times per year). Finally our EOF analysis indicate that more than half of the along-\nisobath velocity time series variance on the continental slope was explained by the BC mesoscale\nactivity.\n\n70\n\n\n\nAppendix A\n\nModel parameters and idealized experiments\nbackground states\n\nAll the scales and parameters used to build the background states and run the stability model are\npresented in Tables A.1, A.2 and A.3.
