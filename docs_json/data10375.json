Consequently,\nit is widely assumed that skin temperature of these\nbare-skinned animals is nearly the same as that of\nwater (Irving &amp; Hart, 1957).\n\nIn general, endothermic animals minimize heat\nloss in cold environments by reducing skin tem-\nperature in order to maintain the least possible\ntemperature differential. This reduction is achieved\n\nby low conduction of heat from the inner body\ntissues to the cutaneous surface. In cetaceans the\nmain thermal barrier is a blubber layer covering most\nof the body. For example, a porpoise with 2 cm of\nblubber can sustain a deep body temperature 39oC\nhigher than that of the ambient water.\n\nWhile fur seals may present skin temperatures\nmore than 20oC above that of ambient water (Boyd,\n2000), bare-skinned dolphins have surface tem-\nperatures usually within 1oC of the water even after\nexercise in warm waters (Noren et al., 1999). Diffe-\nrent models have been used to estimate heat ex-\nchange in marine mammals (Innes, 1986; Kshatriya\n&amp; Blake, 1988; Ryg et al., 1988; Hokkanen, 1990;\nWatts et al., 1993), but the results vary widely, which\nis probably explained by the practical difficulties\n\n\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 64(3B): 719-724, 2004\n\n720 SILVA, R. G.\n\nentailed in measuring body surface temperature of\nthese animals.\n\nThis paper presents an iterative method of\npredicting the skin temperature of cetaceans using\ndeep body temperature, swimming speed, and the\ntemperature and thermodynamic properties of the\nwater.\n\nThe model\nIn the simplest terms, the body of a cetacean\n\nmay be thermally considered as a cylinder of length\nL with a uniformly warm core surrounded by an\ninsulating blubber layer (Scholander et al., 1950; Watts\net al., 1993), whose thickness is assumed to be uniform\nthroughout the body. The inner body temperature is\nwithin the usual mammalian range of 35o to 38oC\n(Kanwischer &amp; Leivestad, 1957; Morrison, 1962;\nKanwischer &amp; Sundnes, 1966) and one can assume\nan average 37oC value without significant error. A\ncylindrical model, illustrated in Fig. 1, has also been\nsupposed by other authors (Ryg et al., 1988; Lavigne\net al., 1990; Watts et al., 1993).\n\nThermal balance is reached when heat input\nequates with heat loss. The thermal balance equation\nin cetaceans is very simple compared to that of\nterrestrial mammals. The only heat input results from\nmetabolism (M ), while heat is lost by conduction\n(K) from the inner body to the skin, from which heat\npasses by convection (C) to ambient water:\n\nKCM += (1)\n\nLatent heat loss by evaporation in the\nrespiratory tract, as observed in most mammals, is\n\nanother way to transfer thermal energy, but cetaceans\nspend much time under water, emerging at intervals\nfor respiration. Thus, heat loss by respiratory\nevaporation is low, i.e., less than 6% of total body\nheat loss (Kanwischer &amp; Sundnes, 1966; Folkow &amp;\nBlix, 1992). On the other hand, fins and flippers are\nregarded as efficient cooling surfaces because they\nhave little or no insulation and a rich blood supply\n(Tomilin, 1951). It must be pointed out that excessive\nheat loss from flippers and fluke is avoided by a\ncounter-current mechanism, which is characterized\nby a special blood vessel arrangement so that that\nthe larger arteries are completely surrounded by veins\n(Schmidt-Nielsen, 1990). This prevents heat from\nreaching the surface of the appendages. The same\nmechanism, also found in the legs of seagulls and\nother birds that swim in cold waters (Steen &amp; Steen,\n1965), transfers heat mainly by conduction from the\ncore to the skin surface through the blubber. The\ncorresponding flux in the steady state is given by:\n\n( )\n( )SBB\n\n/ln \n\n \nTT\n\nrRR\nk\n\n?=K (2)\n\n(W.m\u20132), where k\nB\n is the thermal conductivity\n\n(W.m\u20131.K\u20131) of the blubber layer.\nOnce stored in the body surface, the heat is\n\ntransferred by convection to the surrounding water\nat a rate:\n\n( )WS TTh ?=C (3)\n\n(W.m\u20132), where h is the coefficient of convection\n(W.m\u20132.K\u20131).\n\nFig. 1 \u2014 Transverse cut of the body of a cetacean, according to the cylindrical model.

CETACEA 721\n\nWhen considering the hydrodynamic and ther-\nmodynamic aspects of convection, knowledge of\nsurface temperature, T\n\nS\n, for determination of the heat\n\ntransfer coefficient, h, is generally assumed. However,\nin real problems involving cetaceans neither T\n\nS\n nor\n\nh are known, and it becomes necessary to calculate\nconduction and convection simultaneously. At the\nskin surface the convection coefficient h depends on\nthe unknown surface temperature and, in turn, this\ntemperature depends on the heat transfer coefficient.\nThe dependence of h on T\n\nS\n involves the difference\n\nbetween this temperature and that of the environment.\nHence, it is not possible to calculate tem-\n\nperature directly, and an iterative procedure must\nbe considered. The problem of heat transfer by\ncombined conduction and convection from insulated\npipes, comprehensive treatments of which are found\nin many textbooks, is well known in engineering\n(e.g., Chapman, 1987). Another problem is the\nthermal conductivity of blubber. This value and that\nof blubber thickness are the parameters that deter-\nmine insulating capacity, or thermal resistance of\nthe blubber layer. Worthy &amp; Edwards (1990)\nsuggested the value k\n\nB\n = 0.1 W.m\u20131.oC\u20131 for harbor\n\nporpoises, while for whales the usual value is k\nB\n\n= 0.2 W.m\u20131.oC\u20131 (Innes, 1986; Ryg et al., 1988;\nLavigne et al., 1990; Watts et al., 1993). A laboratory\nexperiment by Kvadsheim et al. (1996) showed an\naverage value of 0.25 W.m\u20131.oC\u20131 for minke whales.\n\nNoren et al. (1999) measured experimentally\nthe heat flow at the skin surface of bottlenose dolphins,\nTursiops truncatus, resting in warm (28.5o to 31oC)\nwater. They obtained a flow of 50 W.m\u20132 in the trunk.\nA consistent result reached by these authors showed\nthat the surface temperature T\n\nS\n remained within 1oC\n\nof the water. By using their data and considering the\nbody measurements of the animals observed, we can\napply equation (2) to estimate the value of the blubber\nthermal conductivity as follows:\n\n( ) ( )\nSB\n\nB .\n3137\n\n183.0195.0ln)195.0)(50(ln \n\nTT\nrRR\n\nk =\n?\n\n=\n?\n\n=\nK\n\n= 0.1025 W . m\u20131.oC\u20131\n\nThis value is very close to that of Worthy &amp;\nEdwards (1990).\n\nIterative procedure\nIn order to estimate adequate values for heat\n\nflow from the body of a cetacean to its environment\nan iterative procedure is proposed here, as follows:\n\n1. A trial value of T\nS\n is assumed. For exam-\n\nple, in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops\ntruncatus) the skin temperature remains\nabout 1oC above that of the water tem-\nperature, T\n\nW\n.\n\n2. The mean temperature T\nm \n\n= (T\nS\n + T\n\nW\n)/2 is\n\ncalculated. The following thermal\nproperties of the seawater at this\ntemperature are obtained: specific heat (c\n\np\n),\n\ndensity (?), kinematic viscosity (?), and\nconductivity (k). These properties can be\nfound in Table 1 for temperatures between\n\u20132o to 35oC (271.15 to 308.15 K).\n\n3. The following numbers are calculated: the\nReynolds, R\n\ne \n= Vd?\u20131 and the Prandtl, P\n\nr \n=\n\n?c\np\n?k\u20131, where V is the swimming speed\n\n(m.s\u20131) and d is the characteristic dimension\nof the body, which in this case is the length\n(m). The forced convection is considered\nwhen the animal is moving through water,\notherwise free convection is used, in which\ncase the Grashof number is needed:\n\nG\nr\n = 9.8 d 3 ?\u20132T \u20131\n\nw\n(T\n\nS\n\u2013 T\n\nW\n) (4)\n\nwhere d is the body diameter (m) and all\ntemperatures are in K degrees.\n\n4.

The surface temperature is calculated:\n\n( )\nh\n\nUhTUT\nT\n\n?+\n= WBS (10)\n\nThe result is compared with the initial assump-\ntion for T\n\nS\n, a revised value of T\n\nS\n is chosen, and all\n\ncalculations are repeated. The process continues\nuntil the results converge and a satisfactory\nagreement between two successive T\n\nS \nvalues is\n\nachieved. The extent to which the iterative process\nis carried out depends on desired accuracy. In\ngeneral, less than 10 iterations may be needed until\nadequate convergence is reached.\n\nThe difference ?T between the skin temperature\nestimated by equation 10 and that of the water linearly\ndecrease with water temperature, as shown in Fig.\n2. For example, at T\n\nW \n= 0oC the skin temperature is\n\n7.8oC while it is 31.3oC for T\nW \n\n= 30oC. Experimental\ndata recorded by Noren et al. (1999) showed that\n?T remained at around 1oC for T\n\nW\n values between\n\n28o and 31oC with a linear association. It is noteworthy\nthat these results are in accordance with the values\npredicted by equation 10, despite the lack of expe-\nrimental evidence for cold-water conditions.\n\nThe estimated body surface temperature can\nbe used to determine heat loss by convection and\nconduction as follows:\n\n1. T\nm \n\n= (T\nS\n + T\n\nW\n)/2 is calculated. The thermo-\n\nphysical properties of water at that tem-\nperature are obtained (Table 1).\n\n2. The Nusselt number, N\nu\n, is\n\n \ncalculated.\n\n3. The rate of convective loss, C = kL\u20131N\nu\n (T\n\nS \n\u2013\n\nT\nW\n\n), W.m\u20132 is calculated.\n\nIf the heat lost by respiration is negligible and\na thermal equilibrium steady state can be assumed,\nthen the rate of heat loss by convection calculated\nas above is also an estimate of the rate of metabolic\nheat production (M).\n\nExample\nSuppose a dolphin, 2.5 m in length and 0.37\n\nm in maximum body diameter, is swimming at a 10\nknot speed (5.1 m.s\u20131) in 18oC water. The blubber\nhas an average thickness of 1.23 cm and deep body\ntemperature is 37oC.\n\nSolution\nAssuming an initial value T\n\nS \n= 20oC, the ave-\n\nrage temperature is T\nm \n\n= (20 + 18)/2 = 19oC. In Table\n1, the thermophysical properties of the water are\nfound for this temperature: ? = 1024.8 kg.m\u20133, c\n\np\n =\n\n3.99314 J.kg\u20131.oC\u20131, k = 0.5980 W.m\u20131.oC\u20131, and ? =\n1.07431 x 10\u20133 m2.s\u20131.\n\nFig. 2 \u2014 Difference between water temperature and skin temperature (?T) in cetaceans, as estimated by the iterative method.\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nWater temperature (\u00b0C)\n\nT\n (\n\n\u00b0C\n)\n\n?\n\n\n\nBraz.
