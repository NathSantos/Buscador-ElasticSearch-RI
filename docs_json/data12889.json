Esta rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 o principio b\u00e1sico da RPE e diz-nos \n\nque atrav\u00e9s da contabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos radicais formados, por espectroscopia, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel inferir acerca da \n\ndose radiativa absorvida por uma mol\u00e9cula, sendo este o principal objetivo da dosimetria. \n\nApesar da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o da RPE para fins de dosimetria em radioterapia ser uma aplica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nrelativamente recente, trata-se de uma t\u00e9cnica j\u00e1 muito bem estabelecida em outras \u00e1reas. Em particular, \n\na t\u00e9cnica RPE com dos\u00edmetros de alanina \u00e9 mesmo recomendada pela Ag\u00eancia Internacional de Energia \n\nAt\u00f3mica (IAEA do ingl\u00eas International Atomic Energy Agency) n\u00e3o s\u00f3 para fins de dosimetria \n\nretrospetiva como tamb\u00e9m para a medi\u00e7\u00e3o de doses de radia\u00e7\u00e3o superiores a 6 Gy.  \n\nAs vantagens da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de alanina como material dosim\u00e9trico recaem na estabilidade dos \n\nseus radicais, na resposta linear num intervalo alargado de dose e no facto de ser um material cujas \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas de dispers\u00e3o e absor\u00e7\u00e3o de radia\u00e7\u00e3o ionizante serem muito semelhantes \u00e0s dos tecidos \n\ncorporais. No entanto, apesar de todas as vantagens, a baixa sensibilidade da alanina n\u00e3o permite a sua \n\nutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o para a medi\u00e7\u00e3o e verifica\u00e7\u00e3o de doses inferiores a 6Gy, comummente utilizadas em \n\ntratamentos radioterap\u00eauticos. Deste modo, foram estudados diversos materiais para encontrar o \n\ndos\u00edmetro mais adequado que, mantendo as caracter\u00edsticas vantajosas da alanina, colmatasse o problema \n\nencontrado. \n\nA melhor alternativa encontrada foi o formato de l\u00edtio que apresenta uma sensibilidade quase \n\nsete vezes superior \u00e0 da alanina e uma maior equival\u00eancia \u00e0 \u00e1gua no que respeita os coeficientes de \n\nabsor\u00e7\u00e3o massa-energia em dose de radia\u00e7\u00e3o relevantes em tratamentos de radioterapia. Por \n\nconseguinte, o sistema de RPE com dos\u00edmetros de formato de l\u00edtio come\u00e7ou a ser considerado como \n\numa melhor op\u00e7\u00e3o e diversos testes de caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00eam vindo a ser realizados para aferir acerca da \n\nqualidade, estabilidade e adequabilidade desde novo sistema a v\u00e1rias aplica\u00e7\u00f5es em radioterapia. \n\nO sistema em quest\u00e3o foi aplicado, com sucesso, para verifica\u00e7\u00f5es dosim\u00e9tricas em tratamentos \n\nde Radioterapia Externa como radioterapia de intensidade modulada (IMRT) ou radioterapia \n\nconformacional tridimensional (3D-CRT), em que doses de cerca de 2 Gy por dia \u2013 dependendo do \n\nplano de tratamento - s\u00e3o depositadas no tumor do paciente por um feixe de fot\u00f5es produzidos num \n\nacelerador linear, e em tratamentos de Braquiterapia, em que radiois\u00f3topos s\u00e3o colocadas dentro ou \n\npr\u00f3ximo do alvo do tratamento. Em ambos os casos o sistema dosim\u00e9trico de formato de l\u00edtio mostrou \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\niv \n\n \n\nser robusto, ter uma resposta linear \u00e0s diferentes doses absorvidas e permitir determina\u00e7\u00f5es das doses \n\ncom uma incerteza inferior a 2.5 %. Assim, mesmo n\u00e3o sendo uma t\u00e9cnica considerada para uso di\u00e1rio \n\nem cl\u00ednicas, devido ao moroso processo de leitura do sinal de RPE, o sistema de dosimetria RPE de \n\nformato de l\u00edtio torna-se uma das mais vantajosas alternativas aos sistemas utilizados atualmente em \n\naplica\u00e7\u00f5es em que a obten\u00e7\u00e3o de medi\u00e7\u00f5es de alta precis\u00e3o \u00e9 priorizada relativamente \u00e0 efic\u00e1cia de \n\ntempo, tendo j\u00e1 sido considerado um \u00f3timo candidato para auditorias de dosimetria nas t\u00e9cnicas \n\nestudadas. \n\nNo entanto, apesar das elevadas expectativas, nenhuma investiga\u00e7\u00e3o tinha sido ainda realizada \n\nrelativamente ao funcionamento do sistema de formato de l\u00edtio ap\u00f3s irradia\u00e7\u00e3o com part\u00edculas mais \n\npesadas como prot\u00f5es, cujas intera\u00e7\u00f5es com a mat\u00e9ria s\u00e3o consideravelmente diferentes das dos fot\u00f5es. \n\nApesar do n\u00famero de cl\u00ednicas especializadas em terapia de prot\u00f5es ser relativamente reduzido \n\ndevido aos elevados custos associados e, por conseguinte, a oferta deste tratamento ser ainda limitada, \n\ntrata-se de uma alternativa \u00e0 radioterapia convencional, com claras vantagens no que diz respeito \u00e0 \n\nprecis\u00e3o e efic\u00e1cia do tratamento que adv\u00eam principalmente da deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de energia caracter\u00edstica dos \n\nprot\u00f5es e do associado pico de Bragg, cuja profundidade de ocorr\u00eancia \u00e9 definida pela energia inicial \n\ndada \u00e0s part\u00edculas. Os prot\u00f5es entram no novo meio com uma energia muito elevada e uma taxa de \n\ndeposita\u00e7\u00e3o de energia reduzida mas, com o aumento da profundidade e a diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da energia da \n\npart\u00edcula, esta taxa de deposi\u00e7\u00e3o aumenta gradualmente, atingindo o seu m\u00e1ximo na profundidade do \n\npico de Bragg, onde toda a restante energia das part\u00edculas \u00e9 depositada e as part\u00edculas ficam em repouso, \n\nn\u00e3o depositando mais energia. Assim, controlando a profundidade do pico de Bragg, a maior dose pode \n\nser depositada na \u00e1rea tumoral e os \u00f3rg\u00e3os e tecidos envolventes podem ser poupados, evitando-se os \n\ndanos colaterais associados \u00e0 radioterapia convencional.  \n\nDeste modo, \u00e9 de extrema import\u00e2ncia a exist\u00eancia de um sistema de dosimetria de elevada \n\nqualidade que permita, com elevada precis\u00e3o, a verifica\u00e7\u00e3o das doses de radia\u00e7\u00e3o entregues pelos feixes \n\nde prot\u00f5es utilizados, devendo o sistema RPE ser considerado para esta aplica\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nO trabalho de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o apresentado nesta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o foi realizado com o objetivo de aferir \n\nacerca das caracter\u00edsticas do sistema RPE com formato de l\u00edtio ap\u00f3s irradia\u00e7\u00f5es de prot\u00f5es e da \n\ninflu\u00eancia que a diferente deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de energia e intera\u00e7\u00f5es destas part\u00edculas com a mat\u00e9ria podem ter \n\nno sistema em quest\u00e3o. \n\nA investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e consequente caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o foi feita relativamente a dois t\u00f3picos principais: a \n\ntaxa de resposta do sinal de RPE obtido pelos dos\u00edmetros aquando submetidos a doses de radia\u00e7\u00e3o entre \n\nos 0 Gy e os 9 Gy, atrav\u00e9s da obten\u00e7\u00e3o e an\u00e1lise da curva Dose-Resposta do sistema, e do estudo do \n\ndesvanecimento do sinal durante um per\u00edodo de um m\u00eas. Adicionalmente foi realizado um \u201cteste cego\u201d \n\na fim de verificar a exatid\u00e3o conseguida na estima\u00e7\u00e3o da dose absorvida por um dos\u00edmetro somente \n\natrav\u00e9s do seu sinal RPE e da curva Dose-Resposta. Este trabalho de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o foi realizado na \n\nUniversidade de Link\u00f6ping, na Su\u00e9cia, em parceria com a recente cl\u00ednica de terapia de prot\u00f5es \n\nSkandionkliniken, em Uppsala (Su\u00e9cia), onde todas as irradia\u00e7\u00f5es de prot\u00f5es foram realizadas. \n\nOs resultados confirmaram a elevada qualidade e precis\u00e3o do sistema para verifica\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ndosim\u00e9tricas em terapia de prot\u00f5es. \n\nA curva Dose-resposta mostrou uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o linear entre o sinal de RPE dos dos\u00edmetros e a dose \n\nabsorvida por estes pelo que um maior sinal corresponde a uma maior dose absorvida pelo respetivo \n\ndos\u00edmetro. A elevado valor do coeficiente de correla\u00e7\u00e3o de Pearson entre as vari\u00e1veis foi interpretada \n\ncomo um forte indicador da qualidade das estima\u00e7\u00f5es que se obteriam atrav\u00e9s da rela\u00e7\u00e3o encontrada e \n\nisto foi confirmado no teste \u00e0s cegas em que, utilizando apenas dois grupos de dos\u00edmetros para \n\ndeterminar a curva de Dose-Resposta, a dose desconhecida fornecida a um terceiro grupo de dos\u00edmetros \n\nfoi estimada com um erro de somente 1 %, apenas com base nos seus sinais de RPE e na regress\u00e3o \n\nobtida. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nv \n\n \n\nRelativamente ao estudo do desvanecimento do sinal, cada grupo de dos\u00edmetros foi irradiado \n\nem semanas consecutivas durante um m\u00eas, tendo o sinal de RPE de todos os dos\u00edmetros sido medido \n\nno final desse m\u00eas, no mesmo dia. Os resultados foram evidentes: os sinais de RPE dos dos\u00edmetros \n\ncujas irradia\u00e7\u00f5es decorreram nas primeiras semanas da experi\u00eancia sofreram um desvanecimento maior, \n\ntendo sido registado um desvanecimento m\u00e1ximo na ordem dos 6.50 % durante o per\u00edodo de tempo \n\nestudado. Este fen\u00f3meno, que n\u00e3o havia sido verificado nos sinais de dos\u00edmetros sujeitos a radia\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nfot\u00f5es, constitui assim um dos mais importantes fatores a ter em conta aquando da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema \n\npara verifica\u00e7\u00f5es dosim\u00e9tricas neste tipo de irradia\u00e7\u00f5es com feixes de prot\u00f5es. \n\nAp\u00f3s os testes efetuados, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel afirmar que o sistema de dosimetria RPE com formato de \n\nl\u00edtio mostrou ser robusto e bastante eficaz em verifica\u00e7\u00f5es dosim\u00e9tricas tamb\u00e9m nesta aplica\u00e7\u00e3o. No \n\nentanto, e apesar de uma an\u00e1lise mais extensa deste fen\u00f3meno ser necess\u00e1ria, foi comprovado o \n\ndesvanecimento do sinal de RPE com o tempo pelo que o intervalo de tempo decorrido entre a irradia\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ne a leitura do sinal do dos\u00edmetro se torna num elemento preponderante e determinante na medi\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ndoses absorvidas com a maior precis\u00e3o poss\u00edvel.  \n\nAssim, apesar de poderem ser necess\u00e1rias algumas corre\u00e7\u00f5es aos sinais obtidos no \n\nespectr\u00f3metro, quando a leitura destes sinais n\u00e3o \u00e9 imediata \u00e0 irradia\u00e7\u00e3o, o potencial deste sistema \u00e9 \n\ninquestion\u00e1vel, devendo o sistema RPE com formato de l\u00edtio ser visto como um forte candidato a ser \n\nusado, por exemplo, em auditorias de dosimetria em terapia de prot\u00f5es. \n\n \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Resson\u00e2ncia Paramagn\u00e9tica Eletr\u00f3nica  \n\n   Formato de L\u00edtio  \n\n   Terapia de Prot\u00f5es \n\n    Curvas Dose-Resposta \n\n   Desvanecimento do Sinal \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nvii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\n \n\nElectron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) dosimetry using lithium formate dosimeters started to \n\nbe studied as an alternative to the well-established dosimetry method that uses alanine as dosimeter \n\nmaterial, so that a higher precision and accuracy in the measurements of low absorbed doses commonly \n\nused in radiation therapy could be achieved.  \n\nLithium formate has shown to be a material with properties very similar to alanine and thus \n\nvery suitable for EPR dosimetry, but with the advantage of being up to seven times more sensitive to \n\nsmaller radiation doses. The proposed dosimetry system was tested in both external beam therapy \n\n(photon therapy) and in brachytherapy and the system showed to be very robust, allowed dose \n\ndeterminations with a standard uncertainty lower than 2.5 % and was considered a good candidate for \n\ndosimetry audits in both radiotherapy modalities.  \n\nThe next step and the aim of the present dissertation work is the study and characterization of \n\nthe lithium formate system under proton beam irradiations. The use of heavy charged particles is \n\nassociated to very different interactions of the energy with matter and, consequently, to different dose \n\ndeposition processes that may influence the dosimetry system performance. So, despite the suitability \n\nof the system for the other clinical applications, no assumptions can be made about the system quality \n\nfor dose measurements in proton therapy. \n\nIn this way, the system was studied regarding two main characteristics: the dose response and \n\nthe phenomenon of signal fading. This research work was mainly based in Link\u00f6ping University \n\n(Sweden) but it involved a partnership with Skandionkliniken in Uppsala (Sweden) to perform the \n\nnecessary proton irradiations. \n\nThe first test studied the relation between the EPR signals and the absorbed dose and the results \n\nshowed that not only the obtained regression that characterizes that relation is, as expected, linear but \n\nalso allowed absorbed dose to water estimations with an average estimation uncertainty below the 2 %. \n\nTo complement this test and to verify what accuracy could be reached with a linear regression estimated \n\nwith only two groups of dosimeters, a group of four dosimeters was irradiated with an unknown dose \n\nthat was further estimated with an error of 1 %, confirming the great determinations that can be achieved \n\nwith the present dosimetry system. \n\nThe second study indicated that, after proton irradiations, the EPR signal stored in the lithium \n\nformate dosimeters decreases with time and, for a period of 31 days, a maximum fading of 6.50 % was \n\ndiscovered. This phenomenon is not unexpected in irradiations with heavy particle beams and needs to \n\nbe considered if the irradiation and the EPR signal measurement are not done in the same day because \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nviii \n\n \n\nif a smaller signal than the one associated to the real absorbed dose is considered, erroneous conclusions \n\nwill be consequently taken regarding the absorbed dose by the dosimeter.  \n\nOverall, though more studies need to be done, especially regarding the fading associated to the \n\ndosimeters EPR signals, the lithium formate dosimetry system is considered a very promising tool for \n\ndose verifications in proton beam irradiations. The system not only presents a linear behaviour as it \n\nallows dose estimations with uncertainties lower than the 4 % uncertainty limit accepted in dose delivery \n\nprocesses. Therefore, the lithium formate dosimetry system might actually be a good candidate for \n\naudits in proton radiation therapy. \n\n  \n\n \n\nKey-words: Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) dosimetry \n\n  Lithium Formate  \n\n  Proton therapy \n\n   Dose Response \n\n  Signal Fading \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\n \n\n  \n\nL IS T O F  F IG UR E S  ...........................................................................................................................xi \n\nL IS T O F  T AB LE S  .......................................................................................................................... xiii \n\nAC R O N Y M S  ...................................................................................................................................... xv \n\nIN T R O D UC T IO N  ............................................................................................................................... 1 \n\n1.1.

This group of \n\ndiseases is characterized by an uncontrolled growth and spread of cells, which can invade various parts \n\nof the body and other organs, and affects around 14 million people every year, being responsible for \n\nabout 8 million deaths per year according to the World Cancer Report [1] from the World Health \n\nOrganization (WHO). \n\nEach of the over one hundred different types of cancer require unique diagnosis and specific \n\ntreatments that must be planned by specialized oncologic teams. Radiation therapy, or radiotherapy, \n\ntogether with surgery and chemotherapy are the three main modalities used for cancer treatment. \n\nRadiotherapy as the procedure of using ionising radiation for cancer treatment can be divided \n\ninto two main groups: external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy. In the first, the radiation source \n\nis at a certain distance from the patient and the target is irradiated with an external radiation beam while \n\nin brachytherapy the radiation sources are placed close or even inside the target volume [2].  \n\nThe use of ionising radiation for medical purposes has been a topic of study and concern for \n\nmany years now. The effectiveness of this treatment modality is related with the sensitivity that cells \n\nhave to radiation and how this radiation can damage the genes, interrupting the cell cycle and, \n\nconsequently, leading to the death of cells. The main problem is that, regardless of its efficacy in killing \n\nthe cancerous cells, the ionising radiation also affects normal tissues and damage them, which originates \n\nthe severe side effects associated to most radiotherapy treatments like sore skin, tiredness or hair loss, \n\namong many others. Consequently, all over the world, specialists and researchers work on the \n\ndevelopment of new methods and solutions to reach the best balance between destroying cancer cells \n\nand minimizing damages to the surrounding healthy tissues.  \n\nWhen not considering the influence of the type of cancer and its degree of development, the \n\neffectiveness of a treatment depends mainly on two factors: the accuracy of the treatment planning and \n\nthe quality of the equipment and technologies of the radiation systems available.  \n\nConcerning the treatment planning process, the dose distributions of target volumes and critical \n\norgans are assessed for each patient and the optimal technique among the treatment modalities available \n\nis chosen by qualified professionals. The planning process starts with the obtainment of a 3D image of \n\nthe patient, most commonly a Computed Tomography (CT), so that the most accurate and realistic data \n\nregarding the anatomy of the patient and the tumour characteristics (location and volume) are used. This \n\ndata is then used as the input for the planning software that contours the different volumes encountered. \n\n\n\n \nC H A P T E R  1  |  I N T R O D U C T I O N  \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\nAccounting this, a specialized medical physicist identifies both the tumour volumes and the surrounding \n\ntissues and Organs at Risk (OAR) and defines the necessary dose distributions.  \n\nA team of physicists together with radiotherapy doctors work to set the final details of the plan \n\nand, in the end, if every step of the planning process is successfully and accurately done, the best and \n\nless harmful treatment for each individual situation is obtained.  \n\nBesides having a precise treatment plan with all the structures well-defined and bordered it is \n\nof the greatest importance that the dose delivery system is also working as expected so that the delivered \n\ndose matches the planned one.  \n\nMedical physicists working with radiotherapy have the responsibility to verify that the correct \n\ndose is being delivered in the right direction towards the patient by performing regular quality controls \n\nand, with this, make sure that the tinny margin that separates the treatment efficacy and the occurrence \n\nof severe side effects is not exceeded.  \n\nThe ideal dose is defined as [3]: \n\n\u201cThe ideal radiation with which to treat cancer is one that \n\ndelivers a defined dose distribution within a target volume.\u201d \n\nAll radiotherapy procedures as susceptible to errors and even the smallest errors during the \n\ntreatment planning, the dose delivery process or in the dosimetry verifications may cause substantial \n\nnegative consequences for the patient. Considering this, it has been argued that the accuracy of the dose \n\ndelivery to the patient in a radiotherapy treatment should be better than 3-4 % [4], considering all the \n\npossible inaccuracies associated to radiotherapy beam characteristics, patient data, treatment planning \n\ndose calculations and absorbed dose determinations.  \n\nIn order to accomplish the accuracy and precision needed, radiation dosimetry or, more \n\nspecifically, medical radiation dosimetry, becomes an essential part of the treatment control. \n\nMedical radiation dosimetry consists on the evaluation, through measurement or calculation, of \n\nthe absorbed dose received by a patient that is exposed to ionising radiation as a consequence of \n\ntherapeutic or diagnostic procedures [5]. Nowadays, there are several methods and equipment available \n\nfor dose verification measurements and each has different characteristics so, according to the aim of the \n\nmeasurement, the most suitable and convenient method should be used.  \n\nRadiation detectors may be divided in two main groups according to how the signal read is \n\ndisplayed. Using a direct reading detector, such as ionization chambers or semiconducting diodes, the \n\nsignal is displayed instantaneously whereas using passive detectors like thermoluminescent detectors \n\n(TLD) or Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) detectors the effects caused by ionizing radiation \n\nresult in data that has to be processed to obtain the signal information regarding the radiation [6].  \n\nThe first group of detectors are, therefore, preferred for clinical applications because they can \n\nshow the result much fast way. In fact, historically, ion chambers have been the main choice for the \n\nmeasurement of the absorbed dose in beams of ionising radiation and most dosimetry protocols are \n\nbased on the use of ionization chamber since it is one of the most accurate and well-known method for \n\ndose determinations [7]. Though, passive detectors are usually characterized by a lower dependence on \n\nthe direction of the beam, do not require connecting cables \u2013 a factor that sometimes makes impossible \n\nthe use of ionization chambers -, and are associated to very precise measurements so, in some \n\ncircumstances, passive detectors can become the most suitable equipment to be used. \n\nThe present thesis is focused on the EPR technique. Its use in radiation therapy is a relatively \n\nnew advance but EPR spectroscopy is already a well-established technique for other dosimetry \n\napplications. In fact, the EPR spectroscopy technique using alanine as the dosimeter material has been \n\naccepted and recommended by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mostly for \n\nretrospective dosimetry [8] and, concerning radiotherapeutic purposes, for the measurement of doses of \n\n\n\n \nC H A P T E R  1  |  I N T R O D U C T I O N  \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nradiation over the 6 Gy [9]. However, the low sensitivity of most EPR materials used so far made it \n\nvery difficult to achieve the precision recommended by the International Commission on Radiation \n\nUnits and Measurements (ICRU) at the dose levels administrated in radiotherapy.  \n\nThe dose determination using the EPR technique is rather time consuming so it is not the most \n\nsuitable technique to be used on the daily basis in clinics and, additionally, requires the purchase and \n\nuse of an expensive high precision spectrometer. Nonetheless, this technique gains relevance due to the \n\naccuracy that might be reached if more sensitive dosimeter materials are used and because of the \n\npossibility of repeating the measurements several times without influencing the radiation signal, \n\nallowing the increase of the results certainty.  \n\nSo, in applications that prioritize the achievement of a high precision and accuracy and do not \n\nrequire a time efficiency, EPR dosimetry with more suitable and sensitive dosimetry materials, become \n\na very realistic and advantageous alternative to other dosimetry systems. \n\nResearch was made to find more appropriate materials for this purpose and one of the most \n\npromising materials is polycrystalline lithium formate monohydrate, commonly referred as lithium \n\nformate. The EPR dosimetry system with this material has already been tested for dosimetry purposes \n\nin some radiotherapy techniques like external beam therapy and brachytherapy and the conclusions \n\nwere very pleasing.  \n\nUnder high LET (Linear Energy Transfer) radiation, however, the behaviour of the system was \n\nstill not studied and for the technique to gain status and consideration among the other dosimetry \n\ntechniques used in radiotherapy, the full characterization of the lithium formate EPR dosimetry system \n\nunder every type of radiation is needed. Particularly, due to the promising benefits of proton therapy \n\nupcoming its high precision dose delivery, the search for accurate and well-known systems for dose \n\nverifications is becoming more and more important. \n\n1.1. AIM \n\nThe present project is focused on the continuation of the characterization of the promising \n\nlithium formate EPR system for dose measurements under clinical proton beams.  \n\nThe alternative of using lithium formate instead of alanine is thought to be considerably more \n\nbeneficial for dose verifications because it is argued to have such a great accuracy that it can measure \n\nabsorbed doses down to 0.2 Gy, accordingly to previous research. In this way, when low uncertainty \n\ndosimetry methods are needed and the high precision is preferred over the time efficiency, the EPR \n\ndosimetry method may be considered as the most suitable one in comparison with ionization chamber \n\ndosimetry or thermoluminescence dosimetry, for example.  \n\nThe lithium formate EPR system has been developed, tested and optimised for photon beams \n\nand was considered a good candidate for dosimetry audits in both external beam therapy and \n\nbrachytherapy. However, the different characteristics of photon beam therapy and charged particle \n\ntherapy result in different radiation-matter interactions and in different dose distribution over the target. \n\nConsequently, the behaviour of a dosimetry system is expected to have some differences.  \n\nConsidering these differences, the greater need to have accurate dosimetry systems for dose \n\nverifications in proton beams and the promising results obtained for photon beam dose verifications, \n\nthe lithium formate EPR dosimetry must also be fully characterized for proton beam irradiations. This \n\nis where the present project is inserted. \n\n\n\n \nC H A P T E R  1  |  I N T R O D U C T I O N  \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nA lithium formate EPR dosimetry system was developed and tested for proton beams with the \n\naim of being characterized regarding the linearity of its response to different doses and also study the \n\nstability of the signal read on the dosimeters over a period of one month. \n\nAll the process of the dosimeters production, calibrations, EPR signal readouts and respective \n\nanalysis were performed in Link\u00f6ping University (LiU). The proton irradiations needed for the study \n\nof the lithium formate dosimeters response were done in the new Swedish proton therapy facility in \n\nUppsala, Skandionkliniken.  \n\n1.2. OUTLINE \n\nChapter 2 provides a literature review over the EPR technique and the present state of the use of this \n\ndosimetry system for radiation therapy dosimetry controls. \n\nChapter 3 describes the types of radiation used for radiotherapy purposes: photon therapy used in the \n\nconventional radiotherapy and particle therapy where the proton therapy is inserted.  \n\nThe main interactions of the ionising particles with matter are clarified and the main \n\ncharacteristics of the proton radiation therapy are enhanced. \n\nChapter 4 clarifies the main concepts of radiation dosimetry. The most important quantities in \n\ndosimetry used for the quantification of radiation are explained as well as the most important \n\nterms used in Radiation Protection and in Medical Dosimetry. Also, a section regarding \n\nradiation dosimeters contains the description and principal characteristics of the most \n\ncommonly used systems with special focus on the Electron Paramagnetic Resonance \n\ntechnique. \n\nChapter 5 presents the materials and methodology used in each experiment. This section includes the \n\ndescription of the manufacture of the lithium formate dosimeters, the homogeneity test and \n\nstandards needed for a batch to be considered homogeneous, the EPR readout procedure and \n\nthe methodology followed for the Linearity Test, Blind Test and Fading Test. \n\nChapter 6 presents the results obtained in each experiment. The analysis is firstly focused on the \n\nacceptance of the batch as homogenous or non-homogeneous and, secondly, focused on the \n\nresults of the main tests where statistical analysis is also presented. Finally, the obtained \n\nresults are discussed and compared to previous research made regarding the EPR dosimetry \n\nand the use of lithium formate dosimeters.  \n\nChapter 7 gives general conclusions regarding all the tests made and the lithium formate dosimetry \n\nsystem behaviour. Also, future directions are given.\n\n\n\n \n\n 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 2  \n\n \n\n \n\nLITERATURE REVIEW \n\n \n \n\nSince the early 20th century, radiation therapy has been used for the treatment of cancer. \n\nHowever, medical dosimetry is a relatively new field and, particularly over the past 40 years, the \n\nconcept as changed a lot and, nowadays, is seen as an essential part of quality assurance in medicine all \n\naround the world [10]. \n\nThe medical physics main goal to increase the accuracy and precision of the dose delivery \n\njustifies a current research in several fields related to medical dosimetry and, for this reason, a big focus \n\nis on the passive dosimeters since most of them are characterized by long term stability, wide dosimetric \n\nrange, small dimensions and the lack of cables or power supplies [11]. \n\nTo understand the EPR technique principles is important to go back to the 1920s, where \n\nscientists began to apply quantum mechanics principles to describe atoms and molecules. From the \n\nStern-Gerlach experiments was possible to conclude that an electron magnetic moment in an atom can \n\nonly take discrete orientations under the influence of a magnetic field and that atoms can absorb energy \n\nand orientate themselves according to the frequency of the radiation they are exposed to. As a result of \n\nthis and many other quantum physics discoveries, the first observation of an EPR peak was registered \n\nin 1945 by Zavoisky when he detected a radiofrequency absorption line from a CuCl22H2O sample.  \n\nIn 1962, Bradshaw [12] demonstrated that EPR was a satisfactory technique for the \n\nmeasurement of radiation doses since the amplitude of the obtained absorption line was directly related \n\nwith the dose itself. He suggested the use of a polycrystalline sample of the amino acid ?-alanine as \n\ndetector material (dosimeter) due several of this material features like: \n\n- high sensitivity to radiation damage: large amounts of free radicals are created in \n\nthe alanine structure after irradiation \n\n- stability: the radical population formed is stable in time, making the dosimeter signal \n\nvirtually independent of the time of irradiation  \n\n- similarity to biological systems in absorbing radiation: the atomic composition of \n\nalanine is tissue or water equivalent to that of human tissue \n\nIn the consequent years, EPR dosimetry has developed in a way that allowed it to be accepted \n\nas a competitive method at higher dose ranges (10 to 105 Gy) to other dosimetry methods [13]. \n\n\n\n  \n C H A P T E R  2  |  L I T E R A T U R E  R E V I E W  \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\nMoreover, in the beginning of the 1980s, IAEA chose alanine as the standard dosimetric material for \n\nhigh dose measurements due to its particular and well-known characteristics [14].  \n\nAt the Istituto Superiore de Sanit\u00e0 (ISS) in Italy, the method of manufacturing solid state alanine \n\ndosimeters was set up in 1983 and the same method was patented in 1985. There, the physicists made \n\na big analysis regarding the response of the dosimeters to gamma rays and the main results were \n\ncoherent with previous experiments: dosimeters with very precise and with reproducible results, no \n\nsubstantial energy or dose rate dependence neither influence of the angle in which the dosimeters detect \n\nthe radiation beam [15].  \n\nAfter this, alanine EPR was established as a precise and accurate dosimetric method likely to \n\nbe applied not only in industrial radiation processing but in radiation therapy as well. \n\nDespite the advantages associated to alanine dosimeters like their tissue-equivalence and \n\nrequiring no energy correction within the range of typical therapeutic beams, their sensitivity was not \n\ngood enough for them to be used in clinical applications that require determinations of lower doses, \n\nranging from 0.2 to 5 Gy [16]. So, aiming to make EPR a competitive dosimetry method for medical \n\napplications, research was made to find more sensitive materials for EPR dosimeters.  \n\nIn 2002, polycrystalline lithium formate monohydrate, commonly known as lithium formate, \n\nwas confirmed to have a sensitivity up to seven times higher than alanine [17] and so, dosimeters made \n\nfrom this material started being analysed with the thought that they could have some clear and practical \n\nadvantages over alanine dosimeters. The advantages of using lithium formate as dosimeter materials \n\nwere enhanced in a later study [18] where was shown that these dosimeters allow the measurement of \n\nabsorbed doses down to 0.2 Gy. Consequently, they were considerable suitable to measure the lower \n\ndose ranges that could not be measured by the alanine dosimeters and, additionally, their linear response \n\nto all ranges indicated promising results for the measurements of doses both in the target of radiotherapy \n\nprocedures as in the surrounding areas. \n\nFor intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy \n\n(3D-CRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), the lithium formate EPR dosimetry was \n\ntested and compared with the ionization chamber [19]. The determined doses agreed very well with \n\nplanned doses and with the doses measured by ionization chambers confirming the potential of this \n\ndosimetry technique in terms of accuracy and the reproducibility of the measurements in external beam \n\ntherapy with photons. Concerning dose measurements around brachytherapy sources with photon \n\nenergies relevant to this technique, the referred EPR system also showed very accurate results [20, 21]. \n\nFor irradiations with proton beams, the radical formation in lithium formate dosimeters was \n\nstudied and reported [22]. In this research, the doses given were between 5 and 20 Gy and conclusions \n\nshowed that the EPR reading signal increased linearly with the dose given and the precision of the \n\nreading was high and comparable with the precision obtained in previous studies of lithium formate \n\nusing photon and electron beams.  \n\nAt the same time, as the LET increased the relative effectiveness of the irradiation - defined as \n\nthe dosimeter signal per absorbed dose in the detector - decreased and this decrease was interpreted as \n\nthe result of several interactions and recombination within the tracks of the high LET particles. With \n\nthis study the indication that the radical population trapped in the lithium formate structure after \n\nirradiation with densely ionising radiation is less stable than irradiation after low LET beams was clear \n\nand the importance of a study regarding the whole lithium formate dosimeter characterization especially \n\nwith high LET particles was more enhanced. The lower stability of radicals after high LET radiation \n\nexposures had been previously referred in a publication from 1989 [23] where the signal from alanine \n\nradicals faded over the time. \n\nThough the research regarding lithium formate EPR is quite promising, many studies are still \n\nfocusing in alanine EPR technique since it is the standard dosimetry method. In 2015, research showed \n\n\n\n  \n C H A P T E R  2  |  L I T E R A T U R E  R E V I E W  \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nthe suitability to use alanine EPR technique for dosimetry characterization of proton beams with range \n\nbetween 10 Gy and 70 Gy [24]. Yet, not much more has been done regarding the characterization of \n\nthe system, particularly to lower radiation doses justifying the need and adequacy of the present project. \n\nThe viability of any dosimetry system using for dose verifications in therapy is primarily \n\nverified with dosimetry audits where the same technique is tested in several clinics [25]. The great \n\nperformance of an audit for clinical trials is what assures the dosimetry accuracy among the different \n\nparticipating clinics and is what warrants reproducible treatment protocols.  \n\nIn the present days, EPR dosimetry using alanine has already been used for audits in the United \n\nKingdom, Italy and Belgium. These audits enhanced the possibility to use alanine detectors to verify \n\nthe dosimetry accuracy of conventional photon and electron beams [26]. Additionally, an end-to-end \n\ntest using alanine dosimetry was designed and tested showing that alanine dosimeters are also suitable \n\ndetectors for audits in heavy particle therapies. However, in this same work some of the weaknesses of \n\nthe alanine dosimeters were exposed, in particular the lower sensitivity to lower doses. \n\nConsidering lithium EPR dosimetry, in Link\u00f6ping University (Sweden), an audit system for \n\nhigh energy external beam therapy using lithium formate dosimeters was also developed [27] with the \n\naim of evaluating the behaviour of these dosimeters during the whole treatment chain (end-to-end test) \n\nincluding CT imaging, planning and dose delivery. To get more realistic results, a head to neck phantom \n\nmade of Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) with heterogeneities was designed and built and the system \n\nwas tested in four clinics in Sweden. Results showed that the developed audit system was suitable for \n\nend-to-end audits since all the measured dose values agreed quite well with the calculated doses \n\nenhancing, once again, the great characteristics of the used dosimetry system. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 8 \n\n\n\n \n\n 9 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 3   \n \n\n \n\nRADIA TION  IN  R ADIOTHERAPY  \n\n \n \n\nRadiation therapy consists on the use of ionizing radiation to treat a disease, most likely cancer. \n\nThe concept of ionizing radiation includes any electromagnetic or particle radiation with enough energy \n\nto ionize common molecules and create electrically charged particles \u2013 ions \u2013 with the liberation of one \n\nor several electrons [28].  \n\nThe ionizations can occur directly once the particle radiation interacts with the matter or the \n\ninteraction might initiate nuclear or elementary-particle transformations that, by their turn, result in \n\nionization. So, ionizing radiation can be divided in directly and indirectly ionizing radiation.  \n\nDirectly ionizing radiation includes several types of charged particles such as electrons, \n\nprotons, alpha particles or heavy ions and means that these particles transfer most of their kinetic energy \n\ndirectly to the medium resulting in absorbed dose by the medium. Indirectly ionizing radiation, on the \n\nother hand, means that the energy is imparted to matter in two steps: firstly, the indirectly ionizing \n\nradiation transfers energy as kinetic energy to secondary particles and only then these charged particles \n\ntransfer most of their kinetic energy to the medium, resulting in the absorbed dose. In this last type of \n\nradiation are included neutral particles like photons and neutrons.  \n\nFor medical purposes is also possible to distinguish two types of radiation used in radiotherapy \n\ntreatments: photon radiation and particle radiation, which will be described next. The basis of \n\nradiotherapy, whatever type is considered, is the way the ionizing radiation and matter interact with \n\neach other and the expected effects of radiation in tumorous cells are always a consequence of the \n\ntransfer of energy of the charged particles moving through a medium to the atoms of the body cells. \n\n3.1.  PHOTO N RA DI A TI ON \n\nUnder the modern theory of light, presented by Albert Einstein in the beginning of the 20th \n\ncentury, a photon is a quantum of electromagnetic radiation. In radiotherapy, the most common beams \n\nused are high energy x-rays and gamma rays, generically named as photon beams. However, the \n\nelectromagnetic spectrum also includes radio waves, infrared rays, visible light and ultraviolet rays and \n\n\n\n  \n C H A P T E R  3  |  R A D I A T I O N  I N  R A D I O T H E R A P Y  \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nall these consist of photons so when referring to photon beams is important to specify what type of \n\nradiation is being used.  \n\nWhat differs among the several radiation types is the photons energy (E) that is known to be \n\nproportional to the photons frequency ?.  \n\n? = ??           (Equation 3.1) \n\nThe relation between the variables is given by Equation 3.1 where ? is the Planck\u2019s constant1. \n\n? =\n?\n\n?\n                                (Equation 3.2) \n\nSince the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation and its wavelength ? can be related by \n\nEquation 3.2, where ? represents the speed of electromagnetic-field propagation, Equation 3.1 can be \n\nrewritten so that the photon energy can be calculated only considering the wavelength ? of the radiation. \n\n? =\n??\n\n?\n         (Equation 3.3) \n\nTherefore, the energy of each photon, given by Equation 3.3, does not depend on the intensity \n\nof the radiation since they all contain the exact same amount of energy. The intensity of a beam is a \n\nfunction of the number of photons striking a given surface area per unit time. \n\nMost external radiation therapy is delivered through linear accelerators \u2013 linac - where electrons \n\nare accelerated to very high velocities and led to strike a heavy metal target to create a beam of photons. \n\nWhen moving through materials they are likely to interact with the matter in different ways, producing \n\ndifferent ionizing photon radiations.  \n\nThe most important interactions [6] to consider in radiotherapy include: \n\n- Photoelectric effect  \n\nThis effect is the consequence of the interaction between the electromagnetic radiation \n\nand the atoms from an attenuator, usually a metal. When the energy of the photons is higher than the \n\nelectrons\u2019 binding energy, all their energy is transferred to the orbital electron that is ejected from the \n\nattenuator with a kinetic energy equivalent to the photon energy minus the binding energy. The empty \n\nspot left by the ejected electron is then filled by an electron from an upper orbital, resulting in the \n\nemission of characteristic X-rays or in the ejection of Auger electrons.  \n\nThe probability of this effect depends on several factors and among those factors are \n\nthe photons energy and the atomic number of the material that absorbs the radiation. For example, for \n\nmaterials with high atomic number, the photoelectric is considerable for higher energies but for \n\nmaterials or compounds with low atomic number (like water) the photoelectric effect is not likely to \n\noccur at energies over 200 keV.  \n\n- Compton scattering \n\nRepresents the interaction of an energetic photon with a quasi-free orbital electron. The \n\nincident photon energy has to be considerably higher than the binding energy of the orbital electron \n\nand, with the interaction, the photon transfers part of its energy to the electron and is scattered in a \n\ndifferent direction with a higher wavelength.  \n\n                                                           \n1 Constant that relates de energy in one quantum (photon) of electromagnetic radiation to the frequency of that \n\nradiation. The value of this constant is approximately 6.626 x 10-34 J.s \n\n\n\n  \n C H A P T E R  3  |  R A D I A T I O N  I N  R A D I O T H E R A P Y  \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\nThe energy given to the electron is, of course, dependant on the initial photon energy \n\nand the angle of scattering: a scattering angle closer to 180? results in a larger amount of energy to the \n\nelectron which is scattered approximately in the photons original path. On the other hand, a small \n\nscattering angle corresponds to a smaller amount of energy given to the electron. After the photon-\n\nelectron interaction, the photon with a lower energy may continue undergoing additional interactions. \n\nThe angular distribution of the photons scattered is given by the Klein-Nishina cross \n\nsection that is independent of the atomic number of the material and that is why it is quite difficulty to \n\ndistinguish tissues in medical images when these images are obtained with energies where the Compton \n\nscattering dominates: between 25 keV and 25 MeV. In this range are included the energy levels used in \n\nmost radiation treatments and so, the Compton scattering is one of the most important interactions in \n\nradiotherapy with photon radiation. \n\n- Pair production \n\nOriginated by the interaction of a photon with the nucleus of an atom and not their \n\norbital electrons, the pair production refers to the creation of an electron-positron pair. In this context, \n\nthe photon disappears and an electron-positron pair is produced in the nuclear Coulomb field.  \n\nThe new particles move away with the remaining energy of the photon converted to \n\nkinetic energy. Since mass is produced out of the photon energy, the pair production effect has an energy \n\nthreshold of 2???\n2 = 1.02 ???. The two will typically be annihilated once they lose their kinetic \n\nenergy, originating annihilation radiation (characteristically photons with 0.511 keV). \n\nThe probability for it to happen is proportional to the logarithm of the incoming photon \n\nenergy and is dependent on the atomic number of the material it goes through. The energy in which pair \n\nproduction dominates is above the 25 MeV in water. \n\nAll the above interactions influence the total attenuation of the photon beam in a medium and \n\nhave to be considered to obtain a more exact quantification of the photon absorption and scattering. The \n\ncontribution of each interaction to the beam attenuation in water is represented in Figure 3.1. \n\nA\ntt\n\ne\nn\n\nu\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n i\nn\n\n c\nm\n\n3\ng\n -\n\n1\n\nEnergy in MeV\n\nTotal photon attenuation\n\nCompton Scattering\n\nPhotoelectric Absorption\n\nPair production in nuclear field\n\nPair production in electric field\n\n103 \n\n102 \n\n101 \n\n100 \n\n10-1 \n\n10-2 \n\n10-3 \n\n10-4 \n10-3         10-2           10-1          100           101           102           103           104           105 \n\nFigure 3.1 - Contribution of each type of interaction to the total photon beam attenuation in water. All \ninteractions must be considered in order to calculate accurately, in the treatment planning, the radiation dose \n\nthat the body will receive and therefore the dose that will be absorbed by the different body tissues. \n\n\n\n  \n C H A P T E R  3  |  R A D I A T I O N  I N  R A D I O T H E R A P Y  \n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nIn a radiotherapy treatment, the photons used produce a cascade of interactions before the \n\nenergy is absorbed as dose, both in the treatment machine and in the patient body. These interactions, \n\nthat might be either one of the above mentioned, where the energy is transferred from the photons to \n\n(secondary) electrons and positrons occur as soon as the photons interact with the material atoms. So, \n\ncharacteristically, the peak dose of photon beams is reached within a few millimetres from the entrance \n\npoint \u2013 \u201cbuild-up effect\u201d -, at a depth correspondent to the range of the first secondary electrons \n\nproduced. The new energetic particles will then ionize and excite other atoms until the initial energy \n\ntransferred to them is lost or the particles exit the body. The beam energy is controlled so that the peak \n\ndose occurs after a few millimetres from the entrance point and the skin is saved from the radiation. \n\nAnother important characteristic is the low-LET that X-rays and Gamma rays are characterized \n\nfor. LET, the acronym for Linear Energy Transfer, is a term applied to quantify energy transferred per \n\nunit length of the track.  So, being classified as low-LET means that the radiation penetrates tissues \n\nvery easily but deposits its energy very infrequently.  \n\nEach accelerated photon causes only one ionization that releases one electron but the secondary \n\nelectrons produced cause many more ionisations and produce other energetic electrons along their track. \n\nThe LET from gamma radiation depends on the energy of those secondary electrons. \n\nAs less energy is transferred from the photon to the target and more is conserved in the photons, \n\nthey can travel further and the probability of interactions with other particles from the medium \n\n(including healthy surrounding tissues) increases. The typical dose deposition from two different photon \n\nbeams is represented in Figure 3.2 by the blue and red lines. \n\nTo control the dose that is deposited in each tissue, the solution passes by the use of several \n\nradiation beams delivered from different angles. Nowadays a commonly used technique for this is \n\nintensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) because it also allows a better dose conformation. This high \n\nprecision 3D technique uses a computer-driven machine that moves around the patient and, in each of \n\nthe pre-defined angles, delivers precise radiation doses, that can vary from angle to angle. With \n\nFigure 3.2 - Dose deposition as a function of depth within the body: comparison between photon beams and a \nproton beams. Photons deposit radiation dose as they penetrate through the body what results in photon beams \n\nirradiating healthy tissues in the whole path. On the other hand, with a proton beam, the largest amount of \n\nenergy is deposited at a defined depth called Bragg Peak and in the rest of the path tissues only absorb relatively \n\nsmall doses of radiation. [52] \n\n\n\n  \n C H A P T E R  3  |  R A D I A T I O N  I N  R A D I O T H E R A P Y  \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\nknowledge of the tumour shape and its characteristics and after the medical team identifies the area to \n\ntreat and the maximum dose that can be absorbed by the organs at risk, the best dose intensity pattern \n\nthat best conforms to the tumour is determined by a medical physicist. \n\nThe combinations of various intensity-modulated fields from different directions allows the \n\ndelivery of a higher dose to the tumour and, at the same time, limits the amount of radiation that is \n\ndeposited in the healthy tissues that are on the beam path.  \n\nDespite all the improvements in treatment technologies such as multi-leaf collimators, IMRT \n\nor image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), photon beam therapy is always be responsible for healthy tissues \n\nto receive considerable radiation doses resulting in harmful side effects for the patient undergoing the \n\ntreatment. Like so, alternative treatments in which these effects are smaller must be considered. \n\n3.2.  PA R TIC LE  RA DI A TI ON \n\nThis group includes not only hadrons as protons and heavy ions but also neutrons and electrons, \n\nall considered ionizing particles for radiotherapy purposes. \n\nThe interest in using charged hadrons is related with the existence of the denominated Bragg \n\npeak which increases the ability to optimise the spatial distribution of the absorbed dose within a tissue \n\nand makes particle radiation the best and more advantageous choice for many cancer treatments.  \n\nThe Bragg peak indicates the point of greatest penetration in the tissue and it occurs because \n\nthe stopping power of the particles increases right before they come to rest. It represents the maximum \n\ndepth the particles reach and this depth is determined by the amount of energy that is given initially to \n\nthe particles by the accelerator. So, the Bragg peak depth can be controlled by the physicist aiming to a \n\nvery precise targeting of the tumour tissue. The particles enter the new medium with a very high energy \n\nand begin to deposit very small radiation doses that increase gradually with the depth increase and the \n\nparticle energy reduction. When the Bragg peak depth is reached, the particles deposit their remaining \n\nenergy and stop irradiating immediately after. \n\nThe Bragg curve is a graph of the energy loss rate of ionizing radiation as a function of the \n\ndistance through a stopping medium. This curve is also represented in Figure 3.2 where the dose \n\ndeposition of protons is compared with the dose deposition of photon radiation and the differences \n\nbetween both techniques are enhanced.  \n\nContrarily to what happens with photon radiation, where the dose deposition peak is reached \n\nwithin a few millimetres from the entrance point of the photon beam, in the particle radiation case, most \n\nenergy is deposited at the depth of the Bragg peak, after which the dose rapidly decreases to zero and \n\nall particles come to rest if no nuclear reactions occur and secondary neutral particles are created.  \n\nThis property reduces significantly the exposition of healthy surrounding tissues to radiation \n\nso, in theory, this reduction of toxicity will also reduce the probability of developing secondary \n\nmalignant tumours induced by the radiation that appear some years after the radiotherapy treatments, a \n\nrisk that appears to be higher for survivors of childhood cancers [29]. In this way, the tolerance of the \n\npatients to the treatment is higher as well as their life quality during and after the treatment. \n\nBesides the advantages related to the Bragg peak that optimise the absorbed dose delivered to \n\nthe target, there are other reasons behind the great interest in the use of particle radiation in radiotherapy. \n\nThese reasons are based both on the physics of the dose transport and deposition and on the \n\nradiobiological effects they have. \n\nThe large mass of charged hadrons results a minimal degree of multiple scatter allowing a well-\n\ndefined lateral definition of the beam. \n\n\n\n  \n C H A P T E R  3  |  R A D I A T I O N  I N  R A D I O T H E R A P Y  \n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\nAnother advantage of hadrons is their high LET when the interaction with the tissues occur. By \n\nthe definition of LET, high LET radiation causes more molecular damages per unit of exposure because \n\nlarge amounts of energy are deposited in small distances. So, the higher localised deposition of energy \n\nresults in a greater relative biological effectiveness (RBE) associated to the use of hadrons in \n\ncomparison with the photon radiation whose secondary electrons are characterised by a low LET. Also, \n\nsince tumours are characterised for being hypoxic2 which makes them more resistant to radiation, the \n\noxygen enhancement ratio (OER) of hadrons becomes a considerably important attribute of hadrons. \n\nDue to all the potential advantages of particle radiation in radiotherapy that is associated with \n\na more effective treatment and less harmful consequences for the patient, a higher attention is being \n\ngiven to the use of proton and other charged particles like helium or carbon ions.  \n\nIn the present context, a special focus is given to proton therapy [5]. \n\n3.2 .1. P R O TO N  T H E R A P Y \n\nProton therapy is an emerging treatment modality to treat cancer and its concept arises from \n\n1946 [30] after Robert Wilson described some physical properties of protons and hypothesised that high \n\nenergetic proton beams could be used to increase the radiation doses to tumours and, at the same time, \n\nminimize radiation to nearby healthy tissues. \n\nThe first treatments using heavy ion beams with protons were performed in 1954 [31] at the \n\nHarvard Cyclotron Laboratory and due to the lack of many clinical conditions (treatment planning, \n\nbeam shaping technology,) were only suited for radiosurgery like pituitary ablation.  \n\nIn Europe, the first synchrocyclotron was developed in Uppsala University (Sweden) around \n\n1950 by Borje Larsson and there, in 1957, it started to be used for cranial radiosurgery and fractionated \n\nradiotherapy [32].  \n\nRegardless of the excellent records about the treatment safety and efficacy, the widespread and \n\nadoption of this technique is being quite slow mostly because of its technical difficulty, much higher \n\ncosts of implementation and the lack of evidence of cost-competitiveness. Yet, this technique has grown \n\nquite a lot and in 2015 there were 51 active proton therapy centres all over the world, 16 of those in \n\nEurope [33]. So, in the future is expected a big spread of proton therapy facilities which will make this \n\ntechnique a more approachable alternative to conventional radiotherapy. \n\nThe technique, as the name indicates is based on the use of protons that are accelerated to really \n\nhigh velocities and can be used for therapeutic purposes. Protons are positively charged and heavy \n\nparticles (in comparison with electrons) and their biggest advantage is the way the destructive power is \n\ndelivered to the tissues associated due to the characteristically high LET. Also, protons travel fast \n\nthrough tissues with few interactions and without changing much the original trajectory until they reach \n\na defined depth where the Bragg peak occurs and the dose is deposited. \n\nThe high dose distribution given by the proton beam to the tumour, with minimal or no exit \n\ndose, allows the tumour to be treated with unmatched accuracy, security and efficiency. By sparing \n\nhealthy surrounding tissues, the characteristic side effects of radiotherapy are significantly reduced and \n\nthe life quality of the patient during and after the treatment is much better. \n\nFor a realistic treatment plan and, thus, a safe treatment is important to be aware of the \n\ninteractions that protons may have with the matter since these interactions is what determine how the \n\ndose will be distributed, how much will be absorbed by tissues and allow to predict how much energy \n\nlosses during the beam path.  \n\n                                                           \n2 Privation of adequate oxygen levels at the tissue level \n\n\n\n  \n C H A P T E R  3  |  R A D I A T I O N  I N  R A D I O T H E R A P Y  \n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\nProtons interact with matter and deposit their energy in mostly in three different ways: energy \n\nloss by ionization, multiple Coulomb scattering and nuclear interactions. The first two interactions \n\nconcern the electromagnetic interaction between the charge of a proton and the charge of atomic \n\nelectrons - or the Coulomb field of the nucleus - whereas the third regards the interaction with the \n\nmaterial nucleus. \n\n- Energy Loss by Ionization \n\nAt the energy levels used clinically, the collisions of protons with atomic electrons, \n\nnamed inelastic Coulomb interactions [34], have a considerable importance. \n\nAs the protons mass is about 1800 times greater than the mass of electrons [35], each \n\ninteraction can only reduce the proton energy a little but since the number of interactions is high, these \n\ninteractions are the main reason for the slowdown of protons in matter and eventually their stopping \n\nafter the proton range is reached. \n\nThe quantum theory of slowing down and stopping process was developed by Bethe \n\nand Bloch in the 1930s and predicts the rate of energy loss as a function of the type and energy of the \n\nincident particle and of the composition of the stopping material [36].  \n\nThe energy loss per unit distance is called stopping power (S) [37] and is defined in \n\nEquation 3.4, where ? is the energy and ? refers to the distance protons go through. The unit for S is \n\n???/??. \n\n? = ?\n??\n\n??\n                                                   (Equation 3.4) \n\nSince the stopping power is proportional to the density of the absorbing material, this \n\nrate is usually expressed as a quantity independent of its mass density ? (? ??3? ), being called mass \n\nstopping power. This quantity is expressed in ???.??2/? and given by Equation 3.5. \n\n?\n\n?\n= ?\n\n1\n\n?\n\n??\n\n??\n                                                  (Equation 3.5) \n\nApart from the interaction of charged particles with atoms and molecules being a \n\nstatistical process, the energy loss occurs as a finite number of individual interactions so it has a \n\nstatistical error associated. This means that protons with the same initial energy will probably not stop \n\nat the exact same depth due to the accumulation of several small variations during the energy loss - \n\nrange straggling [35]. Though this process is only responsible for a fluctuation of about 1 % in the \n\nprotons range [36], it can have quite an influence in the Bragg curve shape so it has to be considered if \n\na precise clinical calculation is needed. This precision is of vital interest in radiotherapy because the \n\nmain advantage of using charged particles is their precise dose deposition in a specific point. \n\n- Multiple Coulomb Scattering \n\nIn addition to the possible interactions with atomic electrons that result in some energy \n\nloss, when passing near an atomic nucleus protons experience an elastic Coulomb scattering caused by \n\nthe charge of the nucleus and are deviated through small angles from their original trajectory.  Elastic \n\nand inelastic Coulomb interactions are designated as Multiple Coulomb Scattering [34]. \n\nThe energy loss can be neglected in this process but the changes in the trajectory of \n\nprotons, even the smaller ones, may be of the utmost importance and must be considered in the \n\noptimization of dose delivery. \n\n\n\n  \n C H A P T E R  3  |  R A D I A T I O N  I N  R A D I O T H E R A P Y  \n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\nThe distribution of the angles after multiple scattering is nearly Gaussian and the \n\nMultiple Coulomb Scattering theory proposed by Goudsmit-Saunderson predicts with great accuracy \n\nthe width of that Gaussian. The characteristics of the multiple scattering angle are predicted as a function \n\nof the incident particle type and energy and the composition of the scattering material [35, 36]. \n\n- Nuclear Interactions \n\nProtons can also interact with the nucleus itself via some non-elastic reactions and these \n\nmight have a much more profound effect in the fate of an individual proton. In these nuclear interactions, \n\nthe nucleus is irreversibly transformed because when a proton is absorbed, the nucleus produces \n\nenergetic secondary protons, deuterons, some other heavier ions or one or more neutrons. Protons and \n\nneutrons are the most important secondary particles to consider because they carry away energy far \n\nfrom the point where they are created.  \n\nThe main effect of nuclear reactions within the therapeutic region of a proton field is a \n\nsmall decrease in absorbed dose due to the removal of primary protons. However, this decrease is mostly \n\ncompensated by the release of secondary protons and other ions. Secondary protons energy corresponds \n\nto about 10 % of the absorbed energy in high energy proton beam treatments so they have small but sill \n\nnon-negligible impact on the dose spatial distribution in a patient [37]. The other ions formed comprise \n\nonly about 1 % or less of the therapeutic absorbed dose. \n\nSimilar to what is done for photon beams, in the proton beam treatment planning all the \n\npossible interactions that protons have with the medium must be considered and calculations must be \n\ndone so that the absorbed dose is predicted as accurately as possible. In Figure 3.3 is illustrated a Monte \n\nCarlo simulation of the planar integrated dose distribution of a proton beam in water and the importance \n\nof each interactions for the total dose is clear. \n\nFigure 3.3 \u2013 Monte Carlo simulation of the planar integrated dose distribution of a proton beam in water. \n\nThe dose from the electromagnetic interactions (DEM) has the bigger influence since they are the biggest \n\nreason for the deceleration and stop of proton The dose resulting from scattered protons (DEL/IE) also is \n\nconsidered as well as the dose from nonelastic nuclear (DNE) that has a much smaller influence but still has \n\nto be considered in the calculations. [49]   \n\n\n\n  \n C H A P T E R  3  |  R A D I A T I O N  I N  R A D I O T H E R A P Y  \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\nThough they can be predicted, neither of the interactions cannot be avoided and some result in \n\nundesirable effects during a proton beam therapy. One of the most important is actually the production \n\nof a small dose of high energetic neutrons during the treatment resulting, for example from the \n\ninteraction of the accelerated protons on the beam production and delivery equipment [37]. Even with \n\nthe existence of a shielding against neutron radiation in any proton therapy installation, the neutron \n\nproduction cannot be avoided because they are also produced in the patient itself. \n\nNeutrons are known for having a strong biological effect so even minor neutrons doses might \n\nactually have a great impact in the induction of secondary malignancies regarding the long term health \n\nof cancer patients.  \n\nThe long term effects of proton therapy is one of the most controversial topics regarding this \n\ntechnique because the use of proton therapy as a real alternative to the conventional radiotherapy is a \n\nrelatively new advance and, though the neutron production also happens during the photon beam \n\ntherapy, the relative impact of it in each technique is still not certain. However, studies comparing \n\nsecondary malignancies between patients treated with proton beams and photon beams show a smaller \n\nincidence of these side effects for proton therapy: 5.2 % of proton beam therapy patients had some \n\nsecondary malignancies in comparison with 7.5 % of photon beam patients [38]. Despite this is a \n\ncontroversial issue, research is being made to study the adverse effects of proton therapy and it appears \n\nthat the risk of adverse side effects associated with this technique is still lower than the risks in \n\nconventional radiotherapy. \n\nNowadays, proton beam therapy advantages are more evident and its importance is being more \n\nand more recognized by the medical community. Though, each cancer has its own characteristics as \n\nwell as the many possibilities of treatments which means that, depending on the situation, some \n\ntherapies are more adequate than others.  \n\n Proton therapy is the option of excellence when the treatment options are limited (e.g.: \n\ninoperable tumours) and the conventional therapy using photon beam presents unacceptable risks to \n\npatients, like when the tumours are localized in close proximity to vital organs: central nervous system \n\ntumours, ocular tumours, head and neck tumours, chest tumours, gastrointestinal tumours and pelvic \n\ntumours. Another very common use of proton therapy is in the treatment of paediatric tumours mostly \n\nbecause by avoiding the exposure of high levels of radiation to normal tissue when they are still \n\ndeveloping stage, cognitive impairments, growth defects and cardiac damages can be prevented, as well \n\nas radiation induced tumours and other morbidities in the consequent years.\n\n\n\n \n\n 18 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 19 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 4  \n\n \n\n \n\nRADIATION DOSIMETRY \n\n \n \n\nThe exposure to low levels of ionising radiation is a part of everyone\u2019s day since radiation is \n\nnaturally present in the environment and, at low levels, causes no adverse health problems. However, \n\nat higher levels, like the ones used in medical treatments, ionising radiation can be dangerous if \n\npreventing and controlling measures are not adopted.  \n\nAt higher levels, radiation is responsible for cell death and that is why it is used for radiotherapy \n\npurposes. However, in these treatments, radiation affects not only the cancerous cells but also the \n\nhealthy tissues around and for a controlled and effective treatment, besides knowing the intrinsic \n\ncharacteristics of the type of radiation used, it is essential to accurately quantify the radiation dose to \n\ndeliver to the tissues. Like so, radiation dosimetry plays an essential role in any radiotherapy procedure.  \n\nRadiation dosimetry is the subject that describes methods for the quantitative determination of \n\nenergy deposited in a medium by ionizing radiation and, more importantly, the dose absorbed by the \n\ntissues. Consequently, radiation physicists are the responsible ones for finding the best balance between \n\nthe purpose of the application and the negatives consequences of the exposure.  \n\n4.1.  DOSI ME TR Y  QUA NTI TI E S \n\nThe final aim of medical radiation dosimetry is to know how much radiation is absorbed by the \n\ndifferent tissues in the body when they are irradiated. For this reason, the quantity we aim to determine \n\nin the most accurate and precise way is the absorbed dose that will be further explained. \n\nTo measure the absorbed dose from ionising radiation the knowledge of some dosimetry \n\nquantities beforehand is essential [6]. \n\n4.1.1. F L U E N C E  \n\nA radiation field can be described either by the number of particles existing in the field \u2013 particle \n\nfluence \u2013 or by the energy that those particles transport \u2013 energy fluence. \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  4  |  R A D I A T I O N  D O S I M E T R Y  \n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\nThe particle fluence ? is defined by Equation 4.1 and refers to the number of particles dN that \n\npass through a sphere with cross-sectional area dA. The particle fluence is independent on the incidence \n\nangle of the radiation so the incident radiation and the cross-section area are always perpendicular. The \n\nunit of fluence is m-2. \n\n? = \n??\n\n??\n             (Equation 4.1) \n\nFrom the particle fluence equation is possible to obtain the energy fluence ?, or the total \n\nincident energy that passes through the sphere with cross-sectional area dA, by knowing the energy E \n\ncarried by each particle. The energy fluence is defined by Equation 4.2 and has the unit of J m-2. \n\n? = (\n??\n\n??\n)? =  ?E         (Equation 4.2) \n\n4.1.2. E N E R G Y  IM P A R T E D  \n\nThis term is defined by the total amount of ionizing radiation to matter in a volume.  \n\nAs expressed in Equation 4.3, it results of the sum of the energies of all charged and uncharged \n\nionizing particles that enter the volume Rin and the sum ?Q of all changes of the rest mass of nuclei and \n\nother elementary particles resulting from any interactions in the volume, less the sum of the energies of \n\nall charged and uncharged particles that leave the volume Rout. The energy imparted unit is Joule (J). \n\n? = ??? ? ???? +  ??                    (Equation 4.3) \n\n4.1.3. KE R M A \n\nRegarding the ionization of uncharged particles, is also possible to define kerma (kinetic energy \n\nreleased per unit mass). Kerma quantifies the average amount of energy transferred from the uncharged \n\nionizing particles d????? to charged ionizing particles per unit mass dm.  \n\nKerma, defined in Equation 4.4, is expressed in J/kg or gray (Gy). \n\n? = \n??????\n\n??\n           (Equation 4.4) \n\nThough kerma is quite relevant for indirectly ionizing radiation, the location and the amount of \n\nenergy that is transferred to the ionizing particles are not indicators of the energy that will be absorbed \n\nby the particles in the medium because not all ionizing particles interact with matter.  \n\n4.1.4. C E M A \n\nCema, as the acronym of converted energy per unit mass, is the analogue to kerma but \n\napplicable to directly ionizing particles such as electrons and protons. This quantity describes the energy \n\nEC lost in electronic interactions by the charged particles, with exception of secondary electrons,  with \n\na mass dm of a material, as expressed in Equation 4.5. Similarly to kerma, the SI unit is also gray (Gy). \n\n? = \n???\n\n??\n           (Equation 4.5) \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  4  |  R A D I A T I O N  D O S I M E T R Y  \n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\n4.1.5. A B SO R B E D  DO SE  \n\nThe most important quantity for radiological protection refers to the amount of energy that is \n\nabsorbed by the biological material. The absorbed dose is defined by Equation 4.6 and represents the \n\nquotient of mean energy imparted ?? ?by ionizing radiation to an infinitesimally small volume of mass \n\ndm. This quantity is relevant to both directly and indirectly ionizing radiation and its SI unit is also Gy. \n\n? = \n????\n\n??\n               (Equation 4.6) \n\nThe process of dose deposition has a stochastic nature and so the interactions with matter are \n\nnot continuous and the atoms with which the charged particles interact and are quite random. So, the \n\nabsorbed dose is calculated as the mean of this stochastic distribution of energy in a volume element. \n\n4.2.  RA DI A TI ON PR OTE C TI ON QUANTI TI E S \n\nThe basic physical quantity in dosimetry is, as mentioned, the absorbed dose but for the \n\nradiation protection evaluation this quantity is not enough mostly because it does not represent entirely \n\nthe effectiveness in damaging specific human tissues or organs.  \n\nEach type of ionizing radiation has different effects on body tissues that might be more or less \n\nresistant to that radiation. Consequently, the intrinsic properties of the tissues/ organs must also be \n\nconsidered when planning a treatment and evaluating the amount of radiation that should be given. \n\n4.2.1. OR G A N  DO SE \n\nThe amount of radiation dose absorbed by each organ can be defined by Equation 4.7. The \n\norgan dose results from the quotient between the total energy imparted ?? to that tissue or organ and \n\nthe mass ?? of that same organ/ tissue. As the other mentioned doses, the SI units is Gy.   \n\n?? = \n??\n\n??\n           (Equation 4.7) \n\n4.2.1. E Q U I V A L E N T  DO SE  \n\nThe mean absorbed dose in an organ or tissue has a clear importance in radiation protection \n\nbut, by itself, is not enough to assess the biological damages to that organ. The dose distribution within \n\nan organ has also to be considered and so, information about the radiation type and energy is needed.  \n\nWith energetic photon radiation, for example, each ionization event is more spaced from the \n\nothers and is associated with less energy contrasting the ionization events produced by heavy particle \n\nradiation where much more energy is deposited in each event (high LET) and the events occur much \n\nmore closely. So, logically, the radiation weighting factor ?? for photons must be lower. \n\nThe equivalent dose given to an organ or tissue T in then given by Equation 4.8.  \n\n?? =  ? ????,?

However, in a treatment \n\nan organ can be irradiated with more than one type of radiation, so all contributors to the dose must be \n\nconsidered. The total equivalent dose ?? results of the sum of products of each ?? and ??,?. \n\nThe values of ??, selected by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) \n\nand revised in 2007 [39] are: \n\n? 1 for photons and electrons \n\n? 2 for protons    \n\n? 20 for ?-particles and heavy ions \n\n? 2.5 \u2013 20 for neutrons, depending on the neutron energy ?? and according with the \n\ncontinuous function: \n\n{\n \n \n\n \n 2.5 + 18.2 ??\n\n[ ln (??)]\n2\n\n6\n?\n  ,                     ?? &lt;1???\n\n5.0 + 17.0 ??\n[ ln (2 ??)]\n\n2\n\n6\n?\n  ,   1 ??? ? ??  ? 50 ???\n\n2.5 + 3.25 ??\n[ ln  (0.04 ??)]\n\n2\n\n6\n?\n  ,               ?? > 50 ???\n\n \n\nThe unit for the equivalent dose given by J/kg but takes the special name of Sievert (Sv). \n\n4.2.2.

For this reason, the quantity \n\neffective dose ?, expressed in Equation 4.9 and with SI unit of Sievert, as to be considered. \n\n? =  ? ????

RA DI A TI ON DOSI ME TE R S \n\nThe radiation doses are measured with specific detectors: radiation dosimeters.  \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  4  |  R A D I A T I O N  D O S I M E T R Y  \n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\nA dosimeter along with its reader is referred to as a dosimetry system [6] and every dosimetry \n\nsystem can be characterised by:  \n\n- Precision  \n\nHigh precision is associated with a small standard deviation of the distribution of the \n\nseveral measurement results.  Under similar conditions the measurement results must be reproducible \n\nand accurately predicted from previous measurements.  \n\n- Accuracy \n\nAccurate results are similar to the \u2018true value\u2019 of the measured quantity which means \n\nthat the radiation dose detected by the dosimeter must be coherent with the planned delivered dose by \n\nthe radiation beam.  \n\nThe difference between these two, or the inaccuracy of the result, is called the \n\nuncertainty of the measurement. \n\n- Dose or dose-rate dependence \n\nThe response of the dosimetry system must be independent of the rate of the dosimetric \n\nquantity measured. However, high dose rates usually influence the dosimeter readings, leading to the \n\nsaturation of the system. \n\n- Energy Dependence \n\nMost dosimetry systems are calibrated at a quantified radiation beam quality but are \n\nused in a much wider energy range. It is known that the response of the dosimetry system is usually a \n\nfunction of the radiation beam quality so the energy dependence of a dosimetry system must be known \n\nto allow necessary corrections. Ideally the energy dependence of a system should be as low as possible. \n\n- Spatial Resolution \n\nDosimeters should allow the determination of radiation dose from a very small volume \n\nbecause is important that the dose can be characterized at every point of the tissue. \n\nRadiation detectors can be divided in two groups according to whether the signal is displayed \n\ninstantaneously or not and presently, for the daily use in clinic environments, techniques that display \n\nthe result faster and accurately are preferred.  Ionization chamber dosimetry is the most commonly used \n\ndosimetry technique for dose verifications and beam calibrations but, as mentioned, in some cases this \n\ntechnique is not suitable to be used.  \n\nOther dosimetry systems to consider are film dosimetry, luminescence dosimetry, diode \n\ndosimetry and, important to refer in the context of the present dissertation, Electron Paramagnetic \n\nResonance Dosimetry. Each one of these dosimetry techniques have their own characteristics, \n\nadvantages and disadvantages and so, the dosimeter system choice must take into account the \n\nrequirements of the measurement situation so that the most suitable system is chosen.  \n\nThis thesis is focused on EPR technique as a viable alternative to the existing dosimetry \n\nsystems. Though it can be seen as an alternative to ionization chamber dosimetry in some specific \n\nsituations, the main application of this technique is thought to be dosimetry auditing. In this field, \n\nluminescence dosimetry is a technique that is very well established and to which EPR dosimetry should \n\nbe compared with.  \n\nTo know the general characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of the dosimetry systems \n\nmentioned, the ionization chamber dosimetry and thermoluminescence are now summarized and a \n\nbigger attention and description is given regarding EPR spectroscopy for dosimetry purposes.  \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  4  |  R A D I A T I O N  D O S I M E T R Y  \n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\n4.3.1. IONIZATION CHAMBER DOSIMETRY \n\nThe ionization chamber is nowadays the most practical and most used type of dosimetry used \n\nfor dose control and measurements in radiotherapy. \n\nApart from the different appearances the device may have, it always consists in a gas filled \n\ncavity surrounded by a conductive external wall and with a central collecting electrode.  \n\nAs a fast charged particle passes through a gas, both excited and ionized molecules are created \n\nand a neutral molecules ionisation release a positive ion and a free electron. This released ion pair is the \n\nbasic constituent of the electrical signal formed in the ion chamber and the number of ion pairs created \n\nalong the track of the radiation is the quantity of interest in this technique because, with knowledge of \n\nthe average energy W required to produce an ion pair in a specific gas, is possible to estimate the \n\ndeposited energy by the initial beam. The W quantity is a function of the species of gas present in the \n\ncavity, the type of radiation, and its energy. \n\nConsequently, ionization chambers can be used for the measurement of the absorbed dose in \n\narbitrary materials. For this, the Bragg-Gray principle, expressed by Equation 4.10, is applied. In this, \n\n?? is the relative mass stopping power of the material to that of the gas and ? the number of ion pairs \nper unit mass formed in the gas. \n\n?? = ? ?? ?             (Equation 4.10) \n\nAll the correction parameters associated to the ionization chamber are very well known and that \n\nis why this technique is much recommended for beam calibration in radiotherapy. Also, they are quite \n\nused in diagnostic radiology for the determination of radiation doses because of the high accuracy and \n\nprecision of the results.  \n\nThis system is also preferred for the daily use in clinics because it displays the signal \n\ninstantaneously and can be reused with no or very little change in the sensitivity. However, possible \n\ndisadvantages are the need of connecting cables that might influence the treatment equipment and the \n\nfact that it requires a high voltage supply. \n\n4.3.2. THERMO LUMINESCENT DOSIMETRY \n\nThe thermo luminescent dosimetry (TLD) system has been used by the IAEA\u2019s dosimetry \n\nlaboratory to provide audits since 1969. As the name indicates, the system is based on the phenomenon \n\nof luminescence that occur in some materials when, upon the absorption of radiation, the absorbed \n\nenergy is kept by electrons in metastable states and is then released in the form of ultraviolet, visible or \n\ninfrared light when the dosimeter is submitted to heat. Luminescence can be classified as fluorescence \n\nwhen the light emission occurs within nanoseconds to milliseconds after the irradiation or as \n\nphosphorescence if the light emission takes seconds or even some minutes to occur. \n\nThe process of luminescence can be accelerated using an exciting agent like heat and, in this  \n\ncase, the phenomenon is called thermoluminescence. Two of the most commonly used dosimeter \n\nmaterials used in medical applications are based on lithium fluoride - LiF:Mg,Ti and LiF:Mg,Cu,P - \n\nbecause of their tissue equivalent properties. \n\nMore advantages of these dosimeters include the possibility to perform point dose \n\nmeasurements due to their small size and their linear response over a wide range of the doses used in \n\nradiotherapy. For some doses and materials, however, the dosimeter shows a supralinear behaviour and \n\nmight even saturate. For example, the LiF:Mg,Ti dosimeter presents a supralinear behaviour for doses \n\nover 2 Gy.  \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  4  |  R A D I A T I O N  D O S I M E T R Y  \n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\nDuring the readout, the signal is erased and, if not read carefully, some errors are quite easy to \n\nmake, resulting in inaccurate results. From the TLD readout, correction factors like energy and fading \n\ncorrections must be applied to obtain the correspondent absorbed dose.  \n\nTLD cannot be used for beam calibration but is very applied to perform dosimetry audits in \n\nradiotherapy. \n\n4.3.3. E L E C T R O N  P A R A M A G N E T I C  R E SO N A N C E  DO SI M E T R Y  \n\nElectron Paramagnetic Resonance or EPR is well established spectroscopy method used to \n\nstudy matter with one or more unpaired electrons also known as free radicals. From the moment EPR \n\nspectroscopy started to be used for dosimetry purposes, it has been applied to several purposes: radiation \n\ndose reconstruction (retrospective dosimetry), identification of irradiated food, radiation therapy and \n\nalso geological and archaeological dating. \n\nEPR dosimetry in radiation therapy has progressed quite a lot in the past years and though many \n\nstudies are still being made concerning it, using dosimeters with high sensitivity like the ones used in \n\nEPR dosimetry is thought to be one of the most advantageous methods in the field of radiation dosimetry \n\nregarding its accuracy. \n\n4.3.3.1. B a sic Princip les  \n\nDepending on the number of electrons an atom has in its outermost shell (making it full of not) \n\nthe atom is more or less stable and consequently more or less susceptible to create free radicals. Radicals \n\nare defined as molecular species that contain unpaired electrons in the atomic orbital [40] which are, in \n\nmost cases, chemically reactive and try to interact with other molecules to achieve higher stability, \n\nbehaving as oxidants or reductants. They can be formed by a spontaneous process or due to some \n\nenvironmental factors. \n\nThe creation of free radicals is a very important and biologically measurable effect of ionization \n\nradiation and is the basis of EPR spectrometry for dosimetry purposes. While most of the radicals \n\nformed react instantaneously and disappear, in some materials with crystalline structures where the \n\ndiffusion is limited, the unpaired electrons can persist for long periods. The key issue in EPR is therefore \n\nto find these materials where substantial amounts of free radicals are created and stabilized after \n\nirradiation [31] so they can be easily evaluated and measured. \n\nSo far was found that some organic materials like amino acids, sugars, bone and tooth enamel \n\npresent the needed crystalline structure and, when exposed to radiation, produce quite stable free \n\nradicals, being the ideal materials to be used in EPR spectroscopy. The basic principle in consideration \n\nto identify and quantify the number of the induced radicals is that the absorbed energy from ionising \n\nradiation is proportional to the number of unpaired electrons in the irradiated sample.  \n\nAccording to IAEA [8], EPR spectroscopy is defined as:  \n\n\u201cThe measurement of resonant absorption of electromagnetic energy resulting from the \n\ntransition of unpaired electrons between different energy levels, upon the application of \n\nradio frequency energy to a paramagnetic substance in the presence of a magnetic field\u201d  \n\nThe elementary concepts of this technique arise from the quantum mechanics.

Without any external magnetic influence, the magnetic moment will be \n\nrandomly oriented but, when the electrons are exposed to an external magnetic field B0, the spin can \n\nonly be aligned parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field operator and their orientation defines if the \n\nelectrons are in the state of lowest or highest energy, respectively.  \n\nThe splitting in the two energy states is called Zeeman Effect and is represented in Figure 4.1.  \n\nThe energy of the unpaired electron in each level [41] is given by the following Equation 4.11, \n\nwhere ?0 is the electron energy without any influence of the magnetic field, ?? is the magnetic moment \n\nof the electron, ?? is the Bohr magneton\n3, ? is the g-factor4 and ?0 the applied magnetic field. \n\n? = ?0 + ?? ??  ? ?0                                          (Equation 4.11) \n\nConsidering the symmetrical values that ?? can take, the difference of energy between the two \n\nstates is also given by quantum mechanics and is expressed in Equation 4.12. This is considered the \n\nfundamental equation of EPR spectroscopy. \n\n?? = ??  ? ?0                                                 (Equation 4.12) \n\nAny unpaired electron can move between the two energy levels by either absorbing or emitting \n\na photon of energy ?? and, for that, the resonance condition in Equation 4.13 must be fulfilled. \n\n?? = ??                    (Equation 4.13) \n\nSo, an irradiation at a frequency ? that matches the difference ?E will result in the absorption \n\nof energy and this frequency will also correspond to the resonance frequency of the electrons.  \n\nSince ??  is a constant and the magnitude of  ?0 can be measured, the way to determine ?, the \n\n\u201cfingerprint\u201d of the molecule, is to determine the energy ?? between the two spin levels.  \n\n                                                           \n3 Physical constant and the natural unit of electronic magnetic moment. Its value is approximately 9.274 x 10-28  \n4 Proportionality constant that depends on the electronic configuration of the radical or ion \n\nFigure 4.1 - Illustration of the Zeeman Effect in one free electron. The electron has spin \u00bd and under the \ninfluence of an external magnetic field B0 it magnetic moment can be oriented either in parallel or anti-\n\nparallel to the magnetic field operator. Transitions between both states can be induced by microwave \n\nirradiation.

This is represented on Figure 4.2 A. \n\nIn this way, it is possible to change the energy difference between the two spin states by varying \n\nthe magnetic field strength and, taking this into account, there are two alternative ways to obtain a \n\nspectrum of the sample: either a constant magnetic field is applied and the frequency of the \n\nelectromagnetic radiation is scanned in conventional spectroscopy or a static electromagnetic radiation \n\nis applied (constant frequency) with an oscillating magnetic field and the continuous wave is scanned, \n\nin the named continuous wave technique [42]. Due to the limitations of microwave electronics, the \n\nsecond method is the one preferred in dosimetry and consequently chosen in EPR spectrometry. \n\nThe absorption peak in the spectrum is obtained by means of EPR spectroscopy when Equation \n\n4.12 is satisfied. When the magnetic field strength increases, the difference between the two spin states \n\nenergies also increases until it equals the energy of the electromagnetic radiation and spin-flip \n\ntransitions are induced, resulting in an absorption spectrum. This is represented in Figure 4.2 B. \n\nThe magnetic field at which the absorption peak occurs is named \u201cfield of resonance\u201d and, as \n\nmentioned, is responsible for the resonance phenomenon of the electrons.  \n\nTo obtain the signal, the microwave band of the equipment is defined previously or else the \n\nfield of resonance could never be achieved. This band is associated with a frequency and a field of \n\nresonance and these parameters might vary according to the ? factor. The typical microwave bands for \n\na ? = 2 signal are presented in Table 4.1 [43]. \n\nFigure 4.2 - A: Representation of the increase in the energy levels of an electron spin as \nthe magnetic field applied increases. The dash line indicates the allowed EPR transition \n\nfor 9.8 GHz photons.

Since our interest is to use EPR for medical dosimetry purposes, this water \n\ncriterion is very importance and should be considered. \n\nEven though L and S bands could be used in samples with considerable water content, the \n\nsensitivity would be much lower than the X-Band. On the other hand, W and Q bands are more sensitive \n\nbut are also quite affected by the water content and thus are not suitable for this application. \n\nTable 4.1- Fields of resonance for the typical microwave bands available in EPR \n\nspectrometers.

E PR  Sp ect roscop y \n\nThe EPR absorption spectrum is obtained by a specific equipment called EPR spectrometer. \n\nThe equipment model used for the EPR readout in the test of this research is an Elexsys E500 EPR \n\nspectrometer and is schematically represented in Figure 4.3. \n\n \nFigure 4.3 - Main components of an EPR Elexsys E 500 spectrometer. Is possible to distinguish the microwave bridge; the \n\nmicrowave cavity; the electromagnet that allows a controlled sweep of the magnetic field; the console that includes the \n\nsignal channel and the computer where the output is displayed [44]. \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  4  |  R A D I A T I O N  D O S I M E T R Y  \n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\nThis equipment includes not only the three components existent in any spectrometer - a source \n\nof electromagnetic radiation, a sample and a detector - but also some other components that should be \n\ntaken into consideration due to their importance and will be briefly described. \n\nThe microwave generator and the detector are in a microwave module (or bridge). The \n\ndosimeter is placed in a sample tube positioned in a microwave cavity - or EPR cavity \u2013 which is the \n\nheart of the spectrometer, consisting in a metal box responsible for amplifying the weak signals from \n\nthe sample. Cavities are characterized by their quality factor (Q) that is a measure of the efficiency with \n\nwhich the cavity stores the microwave energy: the bigger Q is, the bigger is the sensitivity of the \n\nspectrometer. \n\nIn the EPR cavity, the phenomenon of resonance occurs and the microwave energy upcoming \n\nfrom the generator is stored inside because, at the resonance frequency of the cavity, no microwaves \n\nare reflected. Consequently, a standing wave is created at the resonance frequency inside the cavity. A \n\ncharacteristic of standing electromagnetic waves is that their electric and magnetic field components \n\nare exactly out of phase so, when one is maximum, the other is minimum. The magnetic field is the one \n\nthat drives the absorption in EPR so, if the sample is placed in the maximum magnetic field, the signal \n\nobtained will be the biggest and the sensitivity will also be higher. \n\nThe microwaves are coupled in the cavity via a hole called iris, whose size can be adjusted by \n\nan iris screw. The size of the iris determines the amount of microwaves that will be reflected back from \n\nthe cavity and how much will enter the cavity. This is automatically done by the iris by cautiously \n\nmatching or transforming the impedances of the cavity and the waveguide (that leads the microwaves \n\nto the cavity).  \n\nWhen the sample absorbs microwave energy, the Q factor is lowered due to the energy losses \n\nand, at the same time, the impedance of the cavity is altered leading to changes in the coupling condition. \n\nTherefore, the cavity is no longer coupled and the microwaves are reflected back to the bridge, \n\noriginating the EPR signal. \n\nThe fixation of the sample tube in the EPR cavity must be very robust and precise to avoid \n\ndisturbing the magnetic field and make possible the reproducibility of the measurements. \n\nThe signal channel is the unit that fits the spectrometer console and contains all the electronics \n\nfor a phase sensitive detection. It provides amplification, processing and recording of the microwave \n\nabsorption in the sample while the magnetic field scans the resonance condition. \n\nThe magnetic field controller also has a great importance because it is responsible for \n\nsuperimposing a rapidly varying small magnet field and, in this way, allowing a controlled and precise \n\nsweep of the magnetic field for the EPR measurements.  \n\nThe magnetic field regulation occurs via a Hall probe placed in the gap of the magnet. This \n\nprobe produces a voltage dependent on the magnetic field that is perpendicular to the probe and the \n\nmagnetic field is regulated by comparing the voltage from the Hall probe with the reference voltage \n\ngiven by the other part of the controller. When these voltages do not match, a correction voltage is sent \n\nto the magnet power supply that changes the amount of current going through the magnets and, thus, \n\nthe magnetic field. When the difference is null, the magnetic field is considered stable and is locked. In \n\nthis way, the microwaves reflected from the cavity are amplitude modulated at the same frequency and \n\nonly these amplitude-modulated signals are detected and contribute to the EPR signal, decreasing the \n\nsignal-to-noise ration (SNR).  \n\nThe choice of the modulation amplitude and frequency by the user have, therefore, to be done \n\nwisely so that the best signal is obtained. Usually, for measurements in the X-band frequency, the \n\nmodulation frequency is set to 100 kHz. \n\nWithin the width of the modulation amplitude, the absorption signal is approximately linear \n\nand the slope of the signal determines the presented wave amplitude, being proportional to each other. \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  4  |  R A D I A T I O N  D O S I M E T R Y  \n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\nSo, as shown in Figure 4.4, the absorption signal is transformed into a sinusoidal wave that is the first \n\nderivative of the absorption spectra. The signal intensity is the peak-to-peak-height of the signal. \n\nLastly, the readout is displayed on the computer screen that is connected to the console. It is in \n\nthis computer that, in the EPR software, all the microwave and signal channel parameters are adjusted.  \n\nIn the obtained sinusoidal wave, the peak-to-peak amplitude (parameter A in Figure 4.4) is \n\nproportional to the number of \n1\n\n2\n spins which is, by its turn, related to the radiation-induced radicals or \n\nabsorbed dose: the main interest of dosimetry. \n\nThe readout technique is non-destructive to the signal and the sample can and must be read \n\nseveral times to improve measurement precision and reduce possible instabilities in the spectrometer \n\nthat might influence the magnetic field. According with previous studies [45] three readouts of each \n\ndosimeter is enough to decrease the relative standard uncertainty of the measurements to 0.60 % and \n\ntherefore obtain more precise values. \n\n4.3.3.3. A d va nt a g es of lit hium  form a t e E PR  Sp ect roscop y  \n\nThe purpose of using lithium formate EPR in radiation therapy arises from the many advantages \n\nthat this dosimetry technique might over some other dosimetric systems, either active methods like \n\nionisation chambers and passive methods like thermoluminescence dosimetry systems, for example.  \n\nThe first important characteristic of EPR comes from the fact that it is a passive method and is \n\nalso an advantage of TLD. Although it does not present the result instantaneously and require some \n\nA \n\nFigure 4.4 - Illustration of the EPR absorption line and the respective first derivative, as \n\nthe EPR signal is presented in the EPR spectroscopy technique. The absorption signal is \n\nmeasured using a modulation amplitude Bm and a constant modulation frequency ? and the \namplitude i is dependent on the slope in the absorption spectrum and oscillates with the \n\nmodulation frequency. The peak-to-peak height A is interpreted as the signal intensity. \n\nFigure adapted from [46] \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  4  |  R A D I A T I O N  D O S I M E T R Y  \n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\ncalibrations and signal analysis, the response of these systems is not dependent on the direction of the \n\nbeam because there is no wiring that might disturb the radiation field [19]. Passive dosimetry methods \n\ncan therefore be one option for dose verifications in IMRT treatments where the existence of cables can \n\ncomplicate the dose measurement in some cases. \n\nIn comparison to other passive methods, EPR is a more advantageous method for its linear dose \n\nresponse over a larger dose range so it can be suitable for dose monitoring in various measurement \n\nsituations, either in phantom verifications or in in-vivo measurements. Another benefit is that the \n\ndosimeter signal is not affected by the dosimeter readout process, unlike the TLD systems, so it can be \n\nmeasured multiple times without having erased the signal. This is very important because, as referred \n\nbefore, repeating the measurements several times will reduce considerably the uncertainty associated \n\nto the measurement. \n\nNonetheless, apart from the properties of the technique itself, the advantages are even more \n\nenhanced with the possibility to choose a tissue equivalent dosimeter material. This is, if a high sensitive \n\ndosimeter material like polycrystalline lithium formate monohydrate is used to manufacture the \n\ndosimeters, a much more precise measurement of the absorbed doses is possible as a result of the similar \n\nbehaviour of radiation regarding the scattering and absorption of ionising radiation in the dosimeter \n\nmaterial and in body tissues. \n\nIn comparison with alanine, the reference material for EPR dosimeters, lithium formate has a \n\nrelatively higher sensitivity and, even though there are some more sensitive materials (ammonium \n\nformate or potassium dithionate), lithium formate is considered the best option among other materials \n\nprecisely because of the tissue equivalent and hydroscopic characteristics [46]. Ammonium formate, \n\nfor example, is a good alternative regarding the tissue equivalence characteristics but is highly \n\nhydroscopic which makes it not suitable for the purpose.  \n\nAlso, the availability of lithium formate in the market is a relevant factor because it allows an \n\neasy, fast and cheap way to produce dosimeters. \n\nAll the above characteristics make EPR dosimetry a quite robust method in the measurement \n\nof almost every radiation range and a good alternative to the other methods.  \n\nThe EPR dosimetry disadvantages are related with the readout equipment which is quite \n\nexpensive and requires some parameters and technical knowledge. The readout process, if three to four \n\nmeasurements are to be made, is also considerably time consuming (around 4 minutes for each reading). \n\nAdditionally, the EPR dosimeter is quite sensitive to some factors that might lead to erroneous \n\nmeasurements like water, temperature \u2013 an important factor during the irradiation process - and \n\nhumidity that should be controlled during the storage of the dosimeters.  \n\n\n\n \n\n 32 \n\n\n\n \n\n 33 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 5  \n\n \n\n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\n \n\nThe lithium formate EPR dosimetry has been developed, tested and optimized for photon beams \n\nand this technique is becoming a realistic option for clinical dosimetry applications mostly because of \n\nits great accuracy. \n\n For heavy particle beams, the variation of the LET along their track suggest a non-\n\nhomogeneous dose deposition in the target and that non-homogeneity might result in some differences \n\nin the performance of the dosimetry system, which should be assessed before it is considered a viable \n\noption for dose verifications. \n\nTo well characterize the lithium formate dosimetry system for proton beams, the further \n\ndescribed methodology was followed.  \n\nThe project is divided in several steps performed both in the city of Link\u00f6ping (Sweden) as in \n\nUppsala (Sweden): the lithium formate dosimeters manufacture and acceptance through a homogeneity \n\ncheck were made in Link\u00f6ping University as well as all the EPR readouts and respective analysis and \n\nall the proton irradiations necessary to the characterization of the lithium formate dosimetry system \n\nwere made in the first and only specialized centre for proton therapy in Scandinavia5: the \n\nSkandionKlinik, in Uppsala.  \n\n5.1.

Then, depending on the mass of the lithium formate sieved, paraffin is added to make the \n\ntablets stable and non-fragile. The amount of solid paraffin to add is calculated so that paraffin \n\nconstitutes 10 % of the total weight of the powder. \n\nTo melt the paraffin and mix it well with the lithium powder, the mixture is placed in a beaker \n\nand heated for 15 minutes in an oven with 88?C. This temperature is chosen so that it is higher than the \n\nmelting point of paraffin and lower than the melting point of the lithium formate, which are 60 ?C and \n\n94 ?C, respectively. After the heating, the content is removed from the oven and is carefully mixed until \n\nit returns to room temperature. The heating and mixing process is repeated three times to guarantee that \n\nthe two materials are well mixed, in the most homogeneous way.  \n\nThen, the mixture is kept for about one hour at the room temperature to solidify the paraffin \n\nbefore the mixture is ready for the dosimeters production in the tablet pressing procedure. \n\nAn amount of 102.0 mg to 103.0 mg of powder is weighted, placed on the cup of the table-top \n\npellet-press shown in Figure 5.1 and by pushing the punch down during some seconds, the powder is \n\npressed and forms a compact cylindrical dosimeter with diameter 4.5 mm and height 4.9 mm.  \n\nThe final weight is verified and if it is in the interval 100.0 \u00b1 1.5 mg the dosimeter is labelled \n\nat its bottoms and kept in a dark glass jar with cotton inside to protect the dosimeter from any possible \n\nphysical damages and UV light radiation. The dosimeters are named according to a system where each \n\nreceives a letter and a certain number of dots (one to five), as shown in Figure 5.2, so each receives an \n\nidentity like aI, aII,aIII, bI, etc.  \n\nThe process is repeated until the number of dosimeters wanted is obtained.  \n\nTo reduce even more any possible external influence due to environmental changes, all the jars \n\ncontaining the tablets are stored in a desiccator with a stable and controlled relative humidity of 35 %. \n\nIn this way, all dosimeters from the same batch are stored in identical conditions and treated equally. \n\nFigure 5.1 - Table-top Pellet-press used for producing \nthe dosimeters. The equipment defines  the dosimeters \n\ncylindrical shape. \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  5  |  M A T E R I A L S  A N D  M E T H O D S  \n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\n5.1 .2.  HO MO G E N E I T Y  T E ST  \n\nAfter the production of the dosimeters, is important to verify that the response of every \n\ndosimeter is similar when they go through the same conditions and absorb the same dose and this is \n\nverified if no properties have been altered during the production process or storage conditions due to, \n\nfor example, contamination or humidity. To guarantee that no dosimeter characteristics were altered \n\nand that they all maintain similar properties, the homogeneity test is performed. \n\nTo do so, the dosimeters are firstly positioned in a PMMA phantom represented in Figure 5.3 \n\nwith twenty holes drilled in a circle and equidistant from the centre in order to guarantee that all \n\ndosimeters are irradiated with the same energy.  \n\nFigure 5.2 \u2013 Five dosimeters labelled according to the system chosen. In one \n\nbottoms the letter representing the group is written and in the other bottom the \n\ndots are drawn. One of the dosimeters from the group is shown by side to give \n\na realistic perception of the dimensions of the tablets. \n\nFigure 5.3 - Schematic representation of the \n\nPMMA phantom used for in Homogeneity Test. \n\nThe phantom of dimensions 15*15*0.5 cm3 has \n\ntwenty holes drilled in circle with a size that allows \n\nthe insertion of the dosimeters. The + sign is \n\npositioned in the irradiation field centre. \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  5  |  M A T E R I A L S  A N D  M E T H O D S  \n\n \n\n36 \n\n \n\nThe PMMA phantom is then centred in a 10 x 10 cm2 square irradiation field and slabs of \n\nPMMA are added on the top of the phantom so that the dosimeters are placed at a depth of 8.5 cm \n\nequivalent to 10 cm water using density scaling. The source-surface distance (SSD) is adjusted to be \n\n100 cm. Finally, a 3 Gy irradiation is performed using a 6 MV photon beam by a linear accelerator.  \n\nIf the batch has more than twenty dosimeters, the procedure must be repeated until all of them \n\nare irradiated and if there are not enough dosimeters to fill all the holes, dummies of the lithium formate \n\ndosimeters must be used to fill them. \n\nAfter the irradiation, the signal of each dosimeter is read using a spectrometer BRUKER \n\nEleXsys E500 with the procedure described in section 5.2 and the results are analysed using the software \n\nMatlab Student R2016a and Microsoft Excel 2016. \n\nTo accept a batch as homogeneous, two criteria must be fulfilled: \n\n- No individual EPR signal must deviate more than 2 % from the average EPR signal \n\nof the whole batch; \n\n- The relative standard deviation (RSD) of the signals of all dosimeters must lower \n\nthan 1 %.  \n\nThe RSD is calculated with Equation 5.1, where ? is the standard deviation of all the signals \n\nobtained and ??? the mean signal of every dosimeters signal. \n\n??? (%) = \n?\n\n???\n \u00d7  100                          (Equation 5.1) \n\nHowever, if the RSD is bigger than 1 % the batch can still be accepted and used if corrections \n\nto the signals are made. For this reason, an individual calibration factor (ICF) is also calculated for each \n\ndosimeter ? using Equation 5.2. This factor is the quotient between each signal ???? read in the \n\nspectrometer and the average ????? ?? ??  of all dosimeters signals. \n\n???  ? = \n??? ?\n\n????? ?? ??\n           (Equation 5.2) \n\nThe ICF is used as a correction factor that is applied to the obtained signal.  \n\nThe individual corrected signal of dosimeter ? ????,? is therefore obtained by the quotient in \n\nEquation 5.3 where ???? is the signal read in the spectrometer of dosimeter ? and ???? is the individual \n\ncalibration factor calculated for the same dosimeter. \n\n????,? = \n??? ?\n\n??? ?\n                                      (Equation 5.3)  \n\n5.2.  EPR  RE A DOUT S \n\nEPR spectra are recorded at room temperature using a BRUKER E500 EleXsys EPR \n\nspectrometer operating at the X-band and equipped with a standard ER4102ST resonator cavity. \n\nEach dosimeter, once at a time, is positioned in the bottom of a glass tube with 5mm inner \n\ndiameter and flat bottom. One of the most important factors to be able to reproduce the measurements \n\nand compare the several results obtained is the guarantee that all dosimeters are placed in the exact \n\nsame position in the tube for every measurement. \n\nAdditionally, the glass tube is held by a pedestal essential to ensure that the tube is placed in \n\nthe exact same position for each measurement.  \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  5  |  M A T E R I A L S  A N D  M E T H O D S  \n\n \n\n37 \n\n \n\nThe spectrometer settings are defined according to Table 5.1. \n\nTable 5.1 \u2013 Spectrometer settings for EPR measurements.

In this way, each readout is \n\nspread out during the day and any possible errors due to the variation of the spectrometers sensitivity \n\nare reduced. The choice of performing four readings of the dosimeters is justified by the previous \n\nconclusions of related experiments [45]. \n\nThe signal intensity is obtained by calculating the peak-to-peak height in the first derivative of \n\nthe absorption spectrum given by the software and similar to the one represented in Figure 4.4. Since \n\nthe signal is read more than once over the day, the real signal associated to each tablet is defined as the \n\nmean value of all the readings made of that specific dosimeter.  \n\n5.3.

Then, the phantom is centred \n\nwith the 10*10 cm2 irradiation field and additional slabs of solid water were added to reach 2.7 cm of \n\nsolid water over the PMMA phantom (Figure 5.5 B). \n\nA depth of 2.7 cm in solid water corresponds to a 2.76 cm depth in water and, accounting the \n\ndosimeter height of 0.5 cm, the centre of the PMMA phantom and, thus, the centre of the dosimeters \n\nheight were placed at an approximate depth of 3 cm. The 3 cm value is the reference depth for the \n\nreference dosimetry at this energy.  \n\nAll the necessary irradiations needed for both linearity test and fading test described next were \n\nperformed using this set-up. \n\nA. \n\n \n\nB. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4 - Schematic representation of the \n\nPMMA phantom used for the proton beam \n\nirradiations.

L I N E A R I T Y  T E ST  \n\nThe first test is regarding the dose dependence of the dosimetry system: as mentioned the \n\nresponse must be independent of the dosimetry quantity measured. \n\nA homogeneous batch of twenty-four dosimeters is produced, tested regarding its homogeneity \n\nand divided in six sub-groups of four dosimeters each. From the homogeneity analysis, the ICF values \n\nwere calculated and saved to be used if homogeneity corrections were needed. \n\nAll the dosimeters were transported to SkandionKliniken inside the UV light protected and air-\n\ntight glass bottles and are only removed from the bottles to carry out the irradiations that were all made \n\nin the same day.  \n\nOnce at a time, each of the dosimeter group is placed in the PMMA phantom in the treatment \n\ngantry and irradiated with a radiation dose between 0 Gy and 9 Gy. The group that received no dose \n\nwas also transported to Skandion and put in the treatment gantry so that its dosimeters would experience \n\nthe same circumstances as the other dosimeters.  \n\nAn ionization-chamber dosimetry control is made before the irradiations to check the reference \n\ndoses of the proton system. From the assumption that the kQ, Q0 \n6\n is the same for water and solid water, \n\nthe measured reference dose of the proton system used is 0.68 Gy per field.  \n\nAs the irradiations were not previously planned \u2013 there was no defined dose plan - and to make \n\nthe setup easier, the irradiated doses to each group are multiples of the reference dose and the number \n\nof fields applied to each group of dosimeters varies from 0 to 13 as Table 5.2 shows.  \n\nTable 5.2 \u2013 Absorbed doses by each sub-group of dosimeters in the Linearity Test. The \n\ndoses given were multiples of the reference dose of the system (0.68 Gy per field) and \n\nthe multiples were chosen so that the doses would be as equally spaced as possible. \n\nGroup 6 was also carried to the clinic but its dosimeters received no dose. \n\nGroup \nReference Dose \n\nper field (Gy) \n\nNumber of fields \n\napplied \nDose (Gy) \n\na 0.68 2 1.36 \n\nb 0.68 4 2.72 \n\nc 0.68 7 4.76 \n\nd 0.68 10 6.80 \n\ne 0.68 13 8.84 \n\nf 0.68 0 0.00 \n\n \n\nAfter the irradiations, the dosimeters are carried back to Link\u00f6ping and the dosimeter signals \n\nare read following the procedure described at section 5.2.  \n\n                                                           \n6 Refers to the chamber-specific quality factor that corrects the chamber response for differences between the \nreference beam quality Q0 (\n\n60Co) and the quality Q of the given beam \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  5  |  M A T E R I A L S  A N D  M E T H O D S  \n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\n Due to practical issues regarding the distance between Uppsala and Link\u00f6ping and the time \n\nneeded to perform all the signal measurements, these are not done in the same day as the irradiations \n\nbut in one of the days following the irradiations.  \n\nOnce all the signals are read, Matlab Student R2016a is used to extract the data from the \n\nobtained signals and those signals are analysed both in Matlab and R.  \n\nFrom the signals a calibration curve is determined to characterize the response of the system to \n\nthe different absorbed doses by each group and conclusions are taken regarding the linearity (or non-\n\nlinearity) of the system. \n\n5.3 .2. B L I N D  T E ST  \n\nTo support the linearity test, a blind test was performed to verify how precisely the absorbed \n\ndose could be predicted from the dosimeter EPR signals once the linear behaviour of the system, \n\nexpressed by the calibration curve, is determined.  \n\nFor this end, a batch of twelve dosimeters was manually produced, tested regarding its \n\nhomogeneity and divided in three groups of four dosimeters each. Each group was placed inside UV \n\nlight protected and air-tight glass bottles and were only removed from the bottles to perform the \n\nirradiations, in SkandionKliniken, and the EPR readouts, in Link\u00f6ping University. \n\nThe dosimeters were taken to SkandionKliniken and, there, one of the groups was not irradiated \n\nwith the clinical proton beam (the zero dose point in the calibration curve), one group was irradiated \n\nwith 7.90 Gy (the second dose point needed to determine the calibration curve) and the third group was \n\nirradiated with an intermediate dose, defined by the medical physicist and unknown to the \n\nexperimentalist.  \n\nThe doses absorbed by each group from the proton beam are expressed in Table 5.3. \n\nTable 5.3 \u2013 Absorbed doses by each sub-group of \n\ndosimeters in the Blind Test. Two of the groups were \n\nirradiated with known doses and the dosimeter signals \n\nwill be used to estimate the calibration dose curve. The \n\nother group received a dose unknown that will be \n\nestimated from the dosimeter signals. \n\nGroup Dose (Gy) \n\na 0.00 \n\nb ? \n\nc 7.90 \n\n  \n\nAfter all the irradiations needed, the dosimeters are carried back to Link\u00f6ping University and \n\nthe EPR signals are read in the EPR spectrometer.  \n\nAll signal information is analysed using both Matlab Student R2016a and R and, with the EPR \n\nsignals of the dosimeters whose absorbed dose is known, the calibration curve that characterizes the \n\nsystem linearity is estimated and a prediction is made regarding the unknown dose.  \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  5  |  M A T E R I A L S  A N D  M E T H O D S  \n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\n5.3 .3.  F A D I N G T E ST  \n\nAnother important characterization of the dosimetry system concerns the signal fading over \n\ntime. To do so, a new batch of dosimeters is produced, tested for homogeneity and 24 dosimeters are \n\nselected. From these, six groups of four dosimeters each are formed taking into account the ICF values \n\nof the dosimeters and each group is placed in a different glass bottle. \n\nFollowing the methodology of previous tests regarding the EPR system, all groups of \n\ndosimeters were carried to SkandionKliniken in the same day and stored there. During a period of one \n\nmonth, each week one of the groups is randomly chosen and is irradiated with approximately 8.84 Gy \n\nunder the same conditions. After a group irradiation the dosimeters are stored in their respective UV-\n\nprotected glass bottle and must not undergo any other irradiation or be used again until the EPR \n\nreadouts. \n\nSince the irradiations are done in different weeks and the proton beam characteristics vary \n\nslightly from week to week, the ionization chamber measurements registered a slight variation between \n\nthe doses absorbed by the different groups. These doses and the dates of when the irradiations happened \n\nare explicit in Table 5.4.  \n\nTable 5.4 - Register of the absorbed doses by each of the groups irradiated. \n\nOnce a week during one month each one of the groups was irradiated with \n\napproximately the same dose. The last group irradiated (group 6) was used \n\nas the reference group to normalize all the other signals. \n\nGroup \nIrradiation Date \n\n(yyyy/mm/dd) \nDose (Gy) \n\na 2017/ 02/ 06 8.82 \n\nb 2017/ 02/ 13 8.76 \n\nc 2017/ 02/ 20 8.87 \n\nd 2017/ 02/ 27 8.82 \n\ne 2017/ 03/ 06 8.85 \n\nf 2017/ 03/ 07 8.83 \n\n \n\nAdditional to the five groups irradiated with one week apart, there was also a sixth group \n\nirradiated one day after group e irradiation. This is made so that group f can be used as a reference group \n\n(to which no fading is considered) and its EPR signal is used to normalize all the other dosimeter group \n\nEPR signals.  \n\nAfter all irradiations, to analyse the fading associated to each group of dosimeters, all \n\ndosimeters are carried back to Link\u00f6ping in the same day and read out two days after in the EPR \n\nspectrometer (due to the impossibility of doing it in the day after). The choice of reading all signals in \n\nthe same day is justified with the results of previous similar tests where irradiating various groups in \n\ndifferent weeks and all dosimeter readouts in the same day was a very successful attempt of minimizing \n\nthe uncertainties resulting from the variations in spectrometer performance and consequent instabilities. \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  5  |  M A T E R I A L S  A N D  M E T H O D S  \n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\n With the obtained signals, Matlab Student R2016a is again used to extract the information \n\nneeded, results are analysed both in Matlab as in R and conclusions regarding the stability and signal \n\nfading of the dosimetry system are taken. \n\n\n\n \n\n 43 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 6  \n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n \n\n \n\nFollowing the methodology described in the previous section, the results of each test made in \n\norder to characterize the lithium formate EPR dosimetry system are now presented.  \n\nEach test analysis includes three sub-sections. \n\nFirstly, the homogeneity test results for the respective batch used is analysed and the decisions \n\nregarding the acceptance of the dosimeters and the need (or no need) to use the ICF values are presented. \n\nSecondly, the main results of the test are presented and a statistical analysis is made to include \n\nthe errors associated to the measurements.  \n\nIn the last section, the results are discussed and compared with previous findings related to the \n\nEPR dosimetry subject. \n\n6.1.  LI NE AR I TY  TE ST \n\n6.1.1. BATCH HOMOGENEITY ANALYSIS \n\nA batch of 24 dosimeters was produced and, before its use, the homogeneity was verified.  \n\nFor the homogeneity test, the dosimeters EPR signals were only read three times instead of the \n\nfour times planned. This happened because no time was left to perform the fourth reading round due to \n\nsome instabilities of the spectrometer over the day: many readouts had to be repeated when inconclusive \n\nresults were obtained and also the settings needed to be readjusted sometimes. \n\nThe results from the homogeneity test are shown in Figure 6.1 where the black circles represent \n\neach dosimeter EPR signal obtained as the average of the three measurements made. Together with the \n\nrepresentation of the individual dosimeter signal, error bars correspondent to the biggest deviation of \n\nthe readouts made to the average signal of each dosimeter were added.  \n\nThis analysis is made to guarantee that all the dosimeters readings were coherent i.e. that despite \n\nthe possible instabilities of the spectrometer the measured signals from the same dosimeter are similar \n\nand do not vary significantly. \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  6  |  R E S U L T S  A N D  D I S C U S S I O N  \n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\nTaking that into, by reading the signal three times the average deviation is 0.53 % which is a \n\nvery satisfactory result. The highest deviation associated to the individual signals was obtained for \n\ndosimeter number 15 in Figure 6.1 and took the value of 1.42 %. Besides this one, only other two \n\ndosimeters had readouts with a variation higher than 1 %: dosimeters number 2 and 21. Consequently, \n\nthe results indicate that the small variations of the signals correspondent to the same dosimeter are more \n\nlikely to be related to sporadic instabilities of the spectrometer that were not noticeable and could not \n\nbe corrected and not related to the specific characteristics of the dosimeters. Therefore, all dosimeters \n\nare considered valid to be used. \n\nSubsequently, the batch homogeneity was verified. \n\nIn an ideally homogeneous batch, no individual dosimeter signal should deviate more than 2 % \n\nfrom the mean signal of the whole batch. With knowledge of the average EPR signal, presented in Table \n\n6.1 the 2 % limit would imply that every dosimeter signal would be in the interval [0.687; 0.715] \n\ndelimited by the light blue dash lines in Figure 6.1. From this figure and from the signal values obtained \n\nis easy to verify that this is only verified to 13 of the 24 dosimeters produced (nearly 54 % of the batch). \n\nHowever, it is also easy to visualize that the signals are not very spread and for that reason an analysis \n\nconsidering a variation of 3 % of the mean signal was also made and is shown in Figure 6.1 by the dark \n\nblue dashed lines. The 3 % variation accepts dosimeters which signal is in the interval [0.680; 0.722] \n\nand in this case 20 in the 24 dosimeters produced verify the condition which corresponds to about 83 \n\n% of the whole batch but still does not include the whole batch.  \n\nFigure 6.1 -  Homogeneity analysis of the batch of dosimeters used in the Linearity Test. The circles represent the average \n\nEPR signal obtained from the three measurements done along the day. The red error bars represent the biggest deviation from \n\nthe mean value of the three measurements performed to each dosimeter. The light blue and dark blue dashed lines are indicative \n\nof the 2 % variation and 3 % variation, respectively, from the whole batch EPR signal mean value that is one of the criteria to \n\nconclude about the homogeneity.   \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  6  |  R E S U L T S  A N D  D I S C U S S I O N  \n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\nFrom this is possible to state that the criteria regarding the variation of the individual signals is \n\nnot fulfilled and the batch is not considered homogeneous. Yet, the statistical measures needed to take \n\nconclusions about the second homogeneity criteria were calculated and are presented in Table 6.1. \n\nTable 6.1 - Overall analysis of the batch to be used in the \n\nLinearity Test. The average EPR signal calculated considering \n\nall dosimeters is presented as well as the standard deviation \n\nassociated to all signals. Considering the values of these two \n\nquantities, the relative standard deviation is also shown. \n\nAverage Signal 0.701 \n\nStandard Deviation (%) 1.6 \n\nRelative Standard Deviation (%) 2.2 \n\n \n\nThe relative standard deviation that represents the deviation of the individual signals around the \n\nmean signal and takes the values of 2.2 %, a value much higher than the 1 % limit defined as the second \n\nhomogeneity criteria. This confirms that the differences of the dosimeters EPR signals are rather \n\nsignificant and the signal variation is most likely attributed to the differences in the individual \n\ndosimeters composition regarding the percentage of lithium formate and paraffin. Despite all the mixing \n\nprocess during the production of the initial mixture, there is no way to guarantee that a perfectly \n\nhomogeneous mixture is achieved and that all portions used to manufacture each dosimeter have the \n\nexact composition. Consequently, even the smallest differences in the quantity of lithium formate in the \n\ndosimeters lead to slightly different EPR signals. \n\nAfter this analysis, since none of the two criteria for homogeneity is verified, the batch is not \n\nconsidered homogeneous. Despite this, all dosimeters are considered valid to be used and, to contour \n\nthe non-homogeneity, the individual calibration factors are calculated to each dosimeter using Equation \n\n5.2 and must be used for further correction of the EPR signals. \n\n6.1.2. LINEARITY TEST ANALYSIS \n\nThe batch of dosimeters was divided in six groups of four dosimeters and the linearity test was \n\nthen performed. After the irradiations needed each dosimeter signal was obtained as the average signal \n\nof the four readouts done in the spectrometer over the day.  \n\nBefore the analysis it is important to realise, firstly, that the absorbed doses mentioned in this \n\nsection correspond only to the dose absorbed during the proton beam irradiation even though a dose of \n\n3 Gy had already been absorbed by all of them during the homogeneity test. In this way, it is expected \n\nthat no dosimeter has a null EPR signal. Secondly, as decided before, all the EPR signal obtained in the \n\nspectrometer after the proton irradiations were corrected with the correspondent individual calibration \n\nfactor and the signal values here presented already account that correction. \n\nA first analysis to the EPR signals of each group of dosimeters is made and presented in Table \n\n6.2. For each group of dosimeters, the values regarding the absorbed dose, the mean EPR signal, the \n\nstandard deviation and the relative standard deviation were calculated. \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  6  |  R E S U L T S  A N D  D I S C U S S I O N  \n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\nTable 6.2 - Summary of the EPR signals measured to each of the irradiated groups in the linearity test. The average \n\nsignal of the four dosimeters of each group is presented as well as the associated standard deviation. Also, for a \n\nbetter comparison between the groups, the relative standard deviation of each group was also calculated. \n\nGroup \nAbsorbed \n\nDose (Gy) \n\nAverage \n\nEPR signal \n\nSignal Standard \n\nDeviation (%) \n\nSignal Relative \n\nStandard Deviation (%) \n\nf 0.00 0.644 0.4 0.6 \n\na 1.36 0.915 0.3 0.3 \n\nb 2.72 1.206 0.8 0.7 \n\nc 4.76 1.623 0.5 0.3 \n\nd 6.80 2.027 1.9 0.9 \n\ne 8.84 2.427 7.2 3.0 \n\n \n\nThe first conclusion is that, as expected, the average EPR signal increases as the absorbed dose \n\nby the dosimeters also increases. Concerning the standard deviation values, no linear behaviour is \n\nvisible and this quantity varies quite randomly between the several groups so no correlation with the \n\nabsorbed dose increase appears to exist. \n\nIn theory, every dosimeter absorbing the same dose should present the same EPR signal and, \n\nconsequently, the mean EPR value of the group must be a good representative of each dosimeter signal \n\nof that same group. To analyse this, the relative standard deviation is more significant since it indicates \n\nhow much the dosimeters signals vary around the respective group mean signal. Evaluating this \n\nquantity, five of the six groups present a relative standard deviation below 1 %, which is a very positive \n\nresult and means that the dispersion of the individual signals of each group around the respective mean \n\nsignal is minimal. Only group e has a relative standard deviation of 3 % that is considerably higher than \n\nthe other but this bigger values does not seem to be related with the higher absorbed dose since no linear \n\nbehaviour is observed between the two variables: the absorbed dose and the groups relative standard \n\ndeviation.  \n\nOverall, as expected, no big dispersion is found among the groups dosimeter signals and is \n\npossible to state that the precision of the signal values within the same group is very satisfactory.  \n\nWith the precision of each group evaluated, the necessary analysis to obtain information \n\nregarding the overall behaviour of the dosimetry system was made with the aim of verifying if the \n\nsystem dose response is dependent on the absorbed dose or, in other words, to verify if the relation \n\nbetween the absorbed dose and the EPR signal is in fact linear or not.  \n\nFor an overview of the system and dosimeters response all signals are represented in function \n\nof the absorbed dose in Figure 6.2. Additionally, the regression that best fit the data is also represented \n\nby the dark full line. \n\nThe relation between both variables is clear as the detected EPR signals increase in a very linear \n\nway with the increase of the absorbed dose by the dosimeters. These findings are supported by the fact \n\nthat regression model that best fit the data is, in fact, a linear model. The equation of this regression is \n\nexpressed in Equation 6.1where S is the EPR signal and D the absorbed dose by the dosimeters. Each \n\nparameter has an associated uncertainty due to the signal measurement uncertainties. \n\n ? = (0.202 \u00b1 0.001) \u00d7  ?) + (0.648 \u00b1 0.003)           (Equation 6.1) \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  6  |  R E S U L T S  A N D  D I S C U S S I O N  \n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\nThe adjusted R-squared of the model was obtained to verify how well the it fits the data and \n\nthe result was a coefficient of 0.99 that proves statistically the correlation between both variables. \n\nThe residual standard error associated to the regression has the value of 2.9 % which is \n\nexplained by the uncertainties associated to the EPR signals estimated by the regression. The residual \n\nstandard error evaluates the differences between the real measured EPR signal of each dosimeter and \n\nthe estimated signals obtained from Equation 6.1, being considered an estimate of the accuracy of \n\ndependent variable.  \n\nThe individual error (E) associated to each individual signal estimation (?) was calculated for \n\neach of the 24 dosimeters using Equation 6.2, considering the EPR signal measured in the spectrometer \n\n(? ?). \n\n?

Each \n\ndosimeter signal is represented by the + symbol and the linear model to which the data points were fit to is also visible by the \n\nfull black line. Considering the uncertainties associated to the obtained regression, the 95 % and 99 % confidence intervals are \n\nalso plotted and represented by the dashed red and green lines, respectively. \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  6  |  R E S U L T S  A N D  D I S C U S S I O N  \n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\nTable 6.3 - Summary of the results regarding the error of each \nsignal estimation to each individual dosimeter of the batch.

In fact, for 15 of the 24 dosimeters the error associated to the signal \n\nestimation is lower than 1 % and there is only one situation where the error between the estimated EPR \n\nsignal and the measured one is bigger than 2 %.  \n\nThis less exact situation is dosimeter eIV \u2013 represented by the lower \u201c+\u201d of group 5 \u2013 and has \n\nan associated error of 4.8 %. This conclusion is a strong indicator that this dosimeter is the one that \n\ncontributes most to the increase of the residual standard error of the regression.  \n\nTo verify this, the regression was estimated without dosimeter eIV and the residual standard \n\nerror of the regression was calculated having, as expected, a considerably lower value: 1.4 %. Still, no \n\ndosimeter should be removed from the batch and all data must be included in the analysis. \n\nThe most important application this test results and of the linear behaviour of the system is \n\nregarding the prediction of one either of the variables. With knowledge of the relation between the \n\nabsorbed dose and the EPR signal it is possible to determine with an associated uncertainty the expected \n\ndosimeter EPR signal from their absorbed dose and vice-versa.  \n\nIn the present case, we take the absorbed dose as a certain value that is considered the same for \n\nall the dosimeters of the same group and, thus, all the possible uncertainties are associated to the EPR \n\nsignals measured. So, considering these uncertainties associated to the predictions made with the linear \n\nmodel, the 95 % and 99 % confidence intervals regarding the EPR signals estimation were obtained.  \n\nFor the intervals calculation, the parameter used was the residual standard error of the \n\nregression and the equation that gives the 95 % confidence interval for the EPR signal (? 95 % ??) is \n\nEquation 6.3. By calculating this interval for every point of the linear regression, the results falls \n\nbetween the red dashed lines represented in Figure 6.2. \n\n? 95 % ?? =  ? \u00b1 0.057                       (Equation 6.3) \n\nSince the equation of the linear regression to obtain EPR signal does not change and is the base \n\nto obtain the confidence intervals, it is expected that the slope of both upper and lower confidence \n\ninterval equations is the same as the slope of the linear regression to which the confidence interval refers \n\nto. Also, coherently with Equation 6.3, the upper and lower lines are symmetrical to the linear regression \n\nand represent an interval of amplitude 2 x 0.057 = 0.114. \n\nBy observation of Figure 6.2, is possible to see that almost every dosimeter signal is included \n\nin the interval and only one \u2013 dosimeter eIV -, falls outside the interval. This was not very surprising \n\nsince this dosimeter is the one to which the signal estimation presented the highest error of 4.8 %. \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  6  |  R E S U L T S  A N D  D I S C U S S I O N  \n\n \n\n49 \n\n \n\nThe same calculation was done regarding the 99 % confidence intervals and the conclusions \n\nare similar. The equation to obtain this interval for the EPR signal (? 99 % ??) is given by Equation 6.4 \n\nand, graphically, corresponds to the green dashed lines under and over the linear regression in Figure \n\n6.2.  \n\n? 99 % ?? =  ? \u00b1 0.075                       (Equation 6.4) \n\nAgain, the slope of both confidence intervals regressions must be the slope of the linear \n\nregression of Equation 6.1 and the lines that delimit the interval are also symmetrical to it, having an \n\namplitude of 2 x 0.0751 = 0.150.  \n\nThe bigger amplitude of the 99 % confidence interval is coherent with statistics because a \n\nprediction with higher certainty is associated with a wider confidence interval than an interval predicted \n\nwith less confidence. Yet, despite the increase of the interval amplitude, dosimeter 24 signal continues \n\nto fall out of the interval limits. \n\nConsidering Equation 6.3 and Equation 6.4, using only the values of the absorbed doses, taken \n\nas certain, the EPR signals associated to each of the doses absorbed by each group and their respective \n\nconfidence intervals were estimated and shown in Table 6.4. \n\nThe comparison between these estimations and the real EPR signals has already been made \n\npreviously and shown to have produced great results. Additionally, since the average group signals are \n\ncoincident with the linear regression, all the estimations were expected to be very well included in the \n\nestimated intervals as the confidence intervals are estimated using as reference the linear regression. \n\nSo, any divergence would only be expected for some individual dosimeters and not in the average group \n\nEPR signals. \n\nTable 6.4 - Estimation of the 95 % and 99 % Confidence Intervals associated to the EPR signals obtained for each \n\nirradiated group. No uncertainty is associated to the variable absorbed dose and the confidence intervals were \n\nestimated taking into account the uncertainties associated only to the measured EPR signals of each dosimeter in \n\neach irradiated group.

Also, there would be only a 1 % probability that the real EPR signal would be \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  6  |  R E S U L T S  A N D  D I S C U S S I O N  \n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\noutside the interval [0.848; 0.998]. In case the EPR signal would be outside the expected interval, the \n\ndosimeter characteristics should be questioned.  \n\nThis line of thinking could be applied to predict any dosimeter EPR signal as long as that \n\ndosimeter belongs to the original batch and a previous homogeneity evaluation had been made together \n\nwith the rest of the batch.  \n\nHowever, according to the aim of radiation dosimetry, there is a much bigger interest in being \n\nable to predict the absorbed dose rather than EPR signal since this variable can be measured as many \n\ntimes as needed. In this way, with knowledge of the relation between the absorbed dose and the EPR \n\nsignal (Equation 6.1) and the confidence interval equation for the EPR signal (Equation 6.3 and \n\nEquation 6.4), the confidence intervals regarding the absorbed dose can be easily obtained.  \n\nCombining Equation 6.1 and Equation 6.3, the 95 % confidence interval for the absorbed dose \n\n( ? 95 % ??) is obtained and presented in Equation 6.5. \n\n ? 95 % ?? =  ? \u00b1 0.28                                           (Equation 6.5) \n\nSimilarly, combining Equation 6.1 and Equation 6.4, the 99 % confidence interval for the \n\nabsorbed dose ( ? 99 % ??) is obtained and presented in Equation 6.6. \n\n ? 99 % ?? =  ? \u00b1 0.37                                           (Equation 6.6) \n\nThe possibility of being able to predict the absorbed dose from the EPR signal obtained is the \n\nmost important consequence of the system linearity.  \n\nTo illustrate the possibility of estimating the absorbed dose from the EPR signal, the average \n\nEPR signals of the groups irradiated with the proton beam was used to estimate the absorbed dose with \n\na 95 % and 99 % confidence. This estimation aims to check if the obtained interval would be coincident \n\nthe real absorbed dose by the groups and to quantify the error associated to the dose estimation.  \n\nThe results are presented in Table 6.5 and the steps followed for the estimation were:  \n\n1.

The estimated dose intervals reflect the uncertainties of the linear regression obtained from the measured \n\ndosimeter EPR signals and should comprise the real absorbed doses. \n\nGroup \nAbsorbed \n\nDose (Gy) \n\nEPR \n\nsignal \n\nEstimated \n\nDose (Gy) \n\nError \n\n(%) \n\n95 % Confidence \n\nInterval for Dose \n\n99 % Confidence \n\nInterval for Dose \n\na 1.36 0.915 1.32 2.9 [1.04; 1.60] [0.95; 1.69] \n\nb 2.72 1.206 2.76 1.5 [2.48; 3.04] [2.39; 3.13] \n\nc 4.76 1.623 4.83 1.4 [4.55; 5.11] [4.46; 5.20] \n\nd 6.80 2.027 6.83 0.4 [6.55; 7.11] [6.46; 7.20] \n\ne 8.84 2.427 8.81 0.3 [8.53; 9.09] [8.44; 9.18] \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  6  |  R E S U L T S  A N D  D I S C U S S I O N  \n\n \n\n51 \n\n \n\nThe errors associated to the estimated doses were calculated using a variation of Equation 6.2 \n\nwhere the real and estimated EPR signals are replaced by the real and estimated absorbed doses. For \n\nevery group studied the estimated doses are very similar to the real absorbed doses which is confirmed \n\nby the low errors associated, always lower than 3 %.  \n\nRegarding the confidence intervals, the real absorbed dose values are very well included in the \n\nestimated intervals for every group estimation. \n\nThough this analysis was done considering only the average group signals, the estimation \n\nprocess can also be done for every dosimeter and, in this case, only one dosimeter absorbed dose (eIV) \n\nis not included in the estimated confidence intervals. This situation is not unexpected since it is a \n\nconsequence of its EPR signal to which the biggest signal estimation error was found, as was already \n\ncommented previously.  \n\nThe estimation failure reflects the 5 % and 1 % probabilities of the confidence interval \n\nestimation process failing, a situation that is always susceptible to happen. \n\nIdeally, the analysis to the individual dosimeters would produce results as good as the ones \n\nobtained in the groups analysis and, to verify this, the errors associated to the dose estimations of each \n\ndosimeter were calculated and are presented in Table 6.6.  \n\nTable 6.6 - Percent errors associated to every dosimeter irradiated with the proton beam dose estimations.

Despite these four cases, no error is \n\nbigger than 2.9 % which confirms the accurate dose estimations that can be obtained from the signal \n\nmeasured from the lithium formate dosimeters and the system studied.  \n\nIn this way, it is proved that the method used is trustworthy and can be used for any dose \n\nestimation with a considerably high certainty as long as the EPR signal is known and the relation \n\nbetween the absorbed dose and the EPR signal of the respective dosimeter is also well-known. \n\n6.1.3. DI SC U SSI O N  \n\nThe accurate determination of absorbed doses depends mostly on the dose response of the \n\nsystem and on how well this behaviour can be determined. In this matter, the characteristics of lithium \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  6  |  R E S U L T S  A N D  D I S C U S S I O N  \n\n \n\n52 \n\n \n\nformate monohydrate have been studied after X-ray irradiations [17, 18] and, regarding its sensitivity, \n\nthis was considered more advantageous than alanine: not only shown a very linear dose response over \n\na very high dose range as allowed the measurement of doses down to 0.1 Gy. Later, the system was \n\ntested for verifications of dose distributions in IMRT and the linear response of the system allowed very \n\naccurate dose measurements from 0.2 Gy to 3.5 Gy [19]. \n\nConsequently, though no studies had yet been made for proton therapy measurements, the \n\nexpectations regarding the use of lithium formate dosimeters to achieve high accuracy dose \n\ndeterminations in proton therapy were great.  \n\nThe obtained results matched the expectations as the residual standard error associated to the \n\nlinear relation between the absorbed dose and the EPR signal is lower than 3 %. Though no direct \n\nconclusions can be taken from this error because it is not associated to the absorbed dose estimation but \n\nto the estimation of the EPR signal from the absorbed dose values, its value is a great indicator of the \n\nquality of the absorbed doses estimations that will be made considering only the read EPR signal.  \n\nThough the absorbed doses were known, the dose estimations procedure was done and the \n\nobtained results, in particular the error between the real doses and the estimated ones, were very \n\nsatisfactory considering the recommended limit of 4 % regarding the dose delivery processes and \n\nradiation dosimetry in general [4]. \n\nSome cases results were not as great as it would be desirable but no direct explanation was \n\nfound since the procedure followed was the same for every dosimeter. These situations shows how the \n\nsystem performance can be somewhat unpredictable due to some external factors that may be very \n\ndifficult to control and that might not have been studied yet. In this way, similarly to what was done \n\nregarding photon irradiations [47], it might be interesting to study the influence of factors like the \n\ntemperature, humidity or light in the dosimeters response after proton irradiations.    \n\nAnother interesting result is the difference between the average signal of the batch after the \n\nHomogeneity Test (0.701) and the average signal of Group f in the Linearity Test that absorbed no dose \n\nfrom the proton beam (0.644). Since no extra dose was absorbed, it was expected that the EPR signal \n\nwould be practically the same. This difference can be partially explained by the fact that the EPR \n\nreadouts were done in different days and, consequently, were exposed to different spectrometer \n\nconditions that might have been more or less stable during the day. Additionally, the dosimeters were \n\nexposed to different environmental conditions between their production and each of the readout days \n\nwhich might have contributed to the slightly decrease of the signal. \n\nThough there are no indications that the EPR signal may fade with time after proton irradiation, \n\nthis option cannot be discarded until the Fading Test is performed. In this way, considering that the time \n\nbetween the proton irradiation and the EPR readout was 7 days due to practical issues, this factor might \n\nalso have influenced the obtained behaviour increasing the uncertainties within the groups and, \n\nconsequently, the residual standard error of the regression used to make the dose determinations. \n\nAdditionally, in case there was indeed some signal fading, this phenomenon may be more noticeable \n\nwhen more radicals are created or, in other words, a bigger dose is absorbed. So, the occurrence of \n\nfading that is expected to be more noticeable in higher EPR signals could also explain the biggest \n\nstandard deviation of Group 5. However, no conclusions can yet be taken regarding this issue. \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  6  |  R E S U L T S  A N D  D I S C U S S I O N  \n\n \n\n53 \n\n \n\n6.2.  BLI ND TE ST \n\n6.2.1. BATCH HOMOGENEITY ANALYSIS \n\nTwelve dosimeters were produced and the homogeneity test was performed. After the 3 Gy pre-\n\nirradiation, each dosimeter was read four times in the spectrometer and the average signals of those \n\nmeasurements are represented by the black circles in represented in Figure 6.3. \n\nA first analysis to Figure 6.3 shows that the EPR signals of the dosimeters after the pre-\n\nirradiation of 3 Gy are not very disperse around the mean signal of the batch, represented by the strong \n\nblue full line, which is a good indicator regarding the batch homogeneity. \n\nThe analysis of the homogeneity begins, however, with the acceptance of the individual \n\ndosimeters and, for this, the variation of the values obtained in the four measurements of each dosimeter, \n\nshown by the red error bars, are analysed. This statistical measure takes the maximum value of 0.8 % \n\nassociated to dosimeter 1, which means that all other dosimeters have a lower deviation associated to \n\nits measurements.  \n\nSupporting this conclusion is the average maximum variation of the four measurements that \n\ntakes the value of 0.4 % which is a rather small deviation.  \n\nFigure 6.3 \u2013 Homogeneity analysis of the batch of dosimeters produced for the Blind Test. The black circles represent each \ndosimeter EPR signal obtained from the four measurements done and the red error bars represent the biggest  deviation from \n\nthe mean value of those measurements.

With knowledge of the average EPR \n\nsignal of the batch of 0.462, the 2 % limit signifies that all signals must be included in the interval \n\n[0.453; 0.471]. Since this is verified for every dosimeter, the first criteria regarding the homogeneity is \n\nfulfilled. \n\nRegarding the second criteria, the relative standard deviation of the batch was calculated and is \n\npresented in Table 6.7 together with the measures needed to calculate. \n\nTable 6.7 - Overall analysis of the batch to be used in the Blind \nTest. The quantities average EPR signal, standard deviation of \n\nthe batch EPR signals and the relative standard deviation of the \n\nbatch are presented in order to take conclusions regarding the \n\nbatch homogeneity.  \n\nAverage Signal 0.462 \n\nStandard Deviation (%) 0.4 \n\nRelative Standard Deviation (%) 0.8 \n\n \n\nThe relative standard deviation of 0.8 % means the second criteria for homogeneity acceptance \n\nthat imposes a limit of 1 % for this parameter is achieved. This value also confirms that the EPR signals \n\ndo not vary much around the batch average signal as it was already evident in Figure 6.3. \n\nIn this way, is possible to consider this batch of 12 dosimeters as homogeneous and no \n\ncorrections to further EPR signals measured with these dosimeters are needed.  \n\n6.2.2. BLIND TEST ANALYSIS \n\nAfter performing the irradiations needed for the present test, each of the dosimeter signals was \n\nread four times. Once again, for this analysis, the 3 Gy pre-absorbed by the dosimeters are not accounted \n\nin the doses mentioned further that only refer to the dose absorbed during the proton beam irradiations. \n\nAs mentioned before, the main purpose of this test is to verify what accuracy is possible to \n\nachieve in the determination of the unknown absorbed dose. \n\nThe first analysis was regarding the EPR signal of each of the three groups of dosimeters \n\nirradiated where the EPR signals of each dosimeter and each group average EPR signal are studied. \n\nAlso, for each group of dosimeters, the respective standard deviation and relative standard deviation \n\nwere calculated and all values are presented in Table 6.8. \n\nA first look to the results confirms that the unknown dose absorbed by the dosimeters of Group \n\nb is between the dose absorbed by the other two groups because its average EPR signal is higher than \n\nGroup a EPR signal and lower than Group c EPR signal. \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  6  |  R E S U L T S  A N D  D I S C U S S I O N  \n\n \n\n55 \n\n \n\nTable 6.8 - Summary of the EPR signals measured to the irradiated dosimeters in the Blind Test.

Since no extra dose was absorbed it was expected that its signal would be similar to the \n\naverage signal of the batch obtained in the homogeneity test and this was verified. \n\nRegarding the other two groups, the parameter that deserves a bigger attention is the relative \n\nstandard deviation values that are considerably high. The four readouts of each group were also analysed \n\nin Table 6.8 and in neither of the groups there is a particular dosimeter whose signal contributes more \n\nto the increase of the standard deviation. In fact, observing the four readouts of both groups b and c, all \n\nthe four dosimeter signals are well spread around the group average signal that is a good representative \n\nof the dosimeters values.  \n\nThe overall system behaviour is analysed and the relation between the absorbed dose and the \n\nEPR signal is obtained considering the data from Group 1 and Group 3.  \n\nThe dosimeters signals are represented in Figure 6.4 by the blue \u201c+\u201d together with the linear \n\nregression that best fit the known data. \n\nFor the present batch, the linear relation between the two variables \u2013 the EPR signal (?) and the \n\nabsorbed dose (?) - is given by Equation 6.7. \n\n ? = (0.153 \u00b1 0.002) \u00d7  ? + (0.479 \u00b1 0.006)                        (Equation 6.7) \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  6  |  R E S U L T S  A N D  D I S C U S S I O N  \n\n \n\n56 \n\n \n\nThe residual standard error associated to the regression is 4.6 % that is explained by the fact \n\nthat only groups of data points were used to estimate the regression and one of the groups has a big \n\nrelative standard deviation associated.  \n\nThough the estimation of the regression could have been made considering only the groups \n\naverage signals and the standard deviation values would only be used later for the confidence interval \n\ncalculations, this would not be representative of the true results obtained and could lead to an inaccurate \n\nestimation of the unknown dose. In this way, a bigger margin of error is preferred with the aim of \n\nobtaining a better estimation.   \n\nSimilarly to what was made in the linearity test analysis, the 95 % and 99 % confidence intervals \n\nassociated to the regression were calculated using as parameter the residual standard error of the \n\nregression and these intervals are delimited by the upper and lower red and green dashed lines in Figure \n\n6.4. The 95 % and 99 % confidence intervals of the EPR signal (? 95 % ?? and ? 99 % ??) are given by \n\nEquations 6.8 and 6.9, respectively. \n\n? 95 % ?? =  ? \u00b1 0.091                                          (Equation 6.8) \n\n? 99 % ?? =  ? \u00b1 0.119                                          (Equation 6.9) \n\nHowever, the main interest is the determination of the absorbed dose from the EPR signal and \n\nthe confidence intervals associated to the unknown absorbed dose of Group b.  \n\n++++\n\n+\n+\n+\n\n+\n\n0 2 4 6 8\n\n0\n.0\n\n0\n.5\n\n1\n.0\n\n1\n.5\n\n2\n.0\n\nEPR Signal in function of the Absorbed Dose\n\nAbsorbed Dose (Gy)\n\nE\nP\n\nR\n S\n\nig\nn\n\na\nl\n\n+ Individual Dosimeter EPR Signal\n\nLinear Regression\n\n95% Confidence Interval\n\n99% Confidence Interval\n\nFigure 6.4 - Relation between the absorbed dose by Group 1 and Group 3 dosimeters irradiated in the Blind Test and their \nrespective EPR signal.

However, since the relative standard deviation \n\nof Group b is as high as Group c relative standard deviation, it might be convenient to have a wider \n\nconfidence interval so that all dosimeter estimations might be included in the interval.   \n\nDue to the high relative standard of the Group b EPR signals it was preferred to use the group \n\naverage EPR signal to determine the unknown dose of the group and the estimation result is presented \n\nin Table 6.9. Additionally, the confidence intervals associated to the determined dose were calculated \n\nwith Equations 6.11 and 6.12.  \n\nTable 6.9 - Estimation of the unknown absorbed dose by \n\nGroup b dosimeters. The estimated dose was calculated from \n\nthe average EPR signal of the group and, concerning this \n\nvalue, the 95 % and 99 % confidence intervals were also \n\ncalculated and are presented. \n\nAverage EPR signal 1.492 \n\nAbsorbed Dose \n\nEstimation (Gy) \n6.63 \n\nAbsorbed Dose 95 % \n\nConfidence Interval (Gy) \n[6.04; 7.22] \n\nAbsorbed Dose 99 % \n\nConfidence Interval (Gy) \n[5.85; 7.41] \n\n \n\nAfter the estimation made, the unknown dose was revealed by the medical physicist responsible \n\nfor the irradiations and the absorbed dose by the four dosimeters of Group 2 was 6.70 Gy. \n\nTo calculate the error associated to the unknown absorbed dose estimation, Equation 6.2 was \n\napplied replacing the signal values for the absorbed dose values. The error between the real absorbed \n\ndose and the estimated one is only 1 %, which is a great result associated to a great accuracy.  \n\nIn this way, despite the bigger relative standard deviations associated to the irradiated groups  \n\nand the wide confidence intervals obtained, the regression estimated with only two groups of dosimeters \n\nled to a quite exact estimation of the dose absorbed by the four dosimeters of the group. \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  6  |  R E S U L T S  A N D  D I S C U S S I O N  \n\n \n\n58 \n\n \n\nTo verify the consequence of the disperse EPR signals of Group b, the dose estimation was \n\ndone for each dosimeter of the group and not the group itself. The estimated doses and the associated \n\nestimation errors are presented in Table 6.10. \n\nThough the results are not as good as desired, they are coherent with the high relative standard \n\ndeviation of the group EPR signals and indicate that the, for the present case, the use of individual \n\ndosimeters signals for dose determinations might result in very inaccurate estimations. Still, the average \n\nof the four dose estimations is still coherent with the value obtained using the average EPR signal. \n\nTable 6.10 \u2013 Dose estimations and associate errors of the four dosimeters of Group b.

DISCUSSION \n\nIt is stated that the dose delivery process accuracy should be better than 4 % [4] and research \n\nregarding the lithium formate dosimetry system showed that this system can be used for dose \n\ndeterminations within a 2.5 % uncertainty in external beam therapy [19]. Consequently, it was essential \n\nto verify the accuracy that could be reached to determine the dose deposited by the clinical proton beam \n\nin the lithium formate dosimeters. \n\nConsidering the Linearity Test results where the linear dose response of the system was \n\nconfirmed, the relation between the EPR signal and the absorbed dose was estimated with only two \n\ngroups of dosimeters. From those groups, only one was irradiated with the proton beam and that same \n\ngroup presented a relative standard deviation associated to the EPR signals considerably high, parameter \n\nthat also presented a big value for the third group of dosimeters irradiated with the unknown dose. Since \n\nthis situation only occurs in the groups irradiated with the proton beam, the disperse EPR signals are \n\nnot likely to be associated with problems in the dosimeters or to the readout process in the spectrometer \n\nbut, most likely, to the irradiation process.  \n\nDespite the irradiation methodology has been followed accurately, the possibility that the dose \n\ndeposition was not homogeneous is considered. The four dosimeters of each group were placed at the \n\nsame depth and at the same distance from the centre of the irradiation field but if, for technical reasons, \n\nthe proton beam deposited its energy in a slightly non-homogeneous way within the irradiation area, \n\nthe dosimeters absorbed slightly different doses, which justifies the different EPR signals responsible \n\nfor the bigger relative standard deviation within each group. In this way, a non-homogeneous dose \n\ndeposition is seen as the likely cause of the disperse results obtained for the two groups irradiated with \n\nthe clinical proton beam. To correct this in further experiments, the solution might be the rotation of the \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  6  |  R E S U L T S  A N D  D I S C U S S I O N  \n\n \n\n59 \n\n \n\nphantom 90? after each quarter of irradiation time which results in every dosimeter absorbing the total \n\ndose and being exposed to the exact same beam characteristics. \n\nOne other top of discussion is the comparison between the regression obtained in the linearity \n\ntest and in the present test. Ideally, the behaviour would be very similar considering the dosimeters \n\ncomposition and the irradiation set-up but this is not verified. The regressions are different not only in \n\nthe zero-dose point that depends on the EPR signal of the dosimeters that receive no dose, but also in \n\nthe slope of the regression that expresses the real relation between the two variables.  \n\nThe zero-dose point signal is justified by the different signals of the dosimeters after the pre-\n\nirradiation for the homogeneity test and, though this value is not coincident, the dose response is not \n\naffected by this. The different slope of the regression, however, indicates that the system behaviour is \n\nsomewhat different and that, at this point, is not possible to generalise the linear regression. Yet, it is \n\nbelieved that this is justified by the small but significant variations of the dosimeters compositions \u2013 \n\nthis batch was considered homogeneous whereas the one used in the linearity test was not -, by the \n\npossible instabilities of the spectrometer during the different days of readout but mostly by the fact that \n\nthe time between the proton irradiations and the EPR readouts was different: 7 days in the Linearity \n\nTest and only 1 day in the present test. \n\nEven though no conclusions regarding the signal fading after proton irradiations are yet known, \n\nthis factor can yet be taken as one of the causes for the different dose response behaviours of the two \n\nbatches. If so, the hypothesis that the fading behaviour is also different according to the absorbed dose \n\nby the dosimeters is placed. According to these specific results, where the slope of the regression whose \n\nsignals were read one week after the irradiation is bigger than the slope of the regression whose signals \n\nwere read one day after, it is thought that this possible fading phenomenon is more evident in signals \n\nassociated to smaller absorbed doses. However, once again, no certainties can be obtained regarding \n\nthis fading topic.  \n\nDespite all this, the main aim of the Blind Test was successfully accomplished and the obtained \n\nresults are, once again, very promising regarding the possibility to use the lithium formate system for \n\ndose measurements with a very reasonable accuracy.  \n\n6.3.  FA DI NG TE ST \n\n6.3.1. BATCH HOMOGENEITY ANALYSIS \n\nA new batch of 25 dosimeters was produced to be used in the fadind characterization. Again, \n\nthe homogeneity was evaluated considering the same two criteria mentioned in Section 5.  \n\nEach dosimeter of this new batch was read four times over the day and the average signal of \n\nthose four readouts and the maximum deviation from the mean is presented in Figure 6.5 by the black \n\ncircles and the red error bars, respectively.  \n\nAnalysing the error bars of each dosimeter, the average maximum deviation from the mean \n\nindividual signal is 0.7 % and, overall, the four measurements of each dosimeters were very coherent \n\nwith the biggest deviation associated to their readouts under the 1 % for almost every dosimeter. Only \n\nthree dosimeters \u2013 number 2, 5 and 10 in Figure 6.5 - presented a slightly higher deviation but still \n\nlower that 1.1 %. Considering the results, all dosimeters are individually validated and available to be \n\nused in the Fading Test.  \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  6  |  R E S U L T S  A N D  D I S C U S S I O N  \n\n \n\n60 \n\n \n\nFollowing the individual analysis, the homogeneity of the batch is studied to verify if the \n\nindividual calibration factors must be considered or not when the results of the fading test are analysed. \n\nThis is done by evaluating the same two criteria mentioned in Section 5. \n\nConsidering the results, the average signal of the batch \u2013 full blue line in the Figure 6.5 \u2013 has \n\nthe value of 0.600 and, regarding the individual dosimeter signal deviation, to agree with the defined \n\nvariation limit of 2 % from the batch mean signal, no dosimeter average signal should be outside the \n\ninterval [0.588; 0.612] which does not happen for most dosimeters. \n\nIn Figure 6.5 this can be observed and only 14 of the dosimeter signals (56 % of the batch) fall \n\nin the space delimited by the light blue dashed lines. Even expanding the deviation limit and analysing \n\nthe dark blue dashed lines of Figure 6.5, only one other dosimeter is included in the group of dosimeters \n\nthat deviate less than 3 % from the mean EPR signal of the batch. \n\nThis means that some of the dosimeters EPR signals are significantly different from the average \n\nsignal and, thus, the first criteria regarding the variation of the individual EPR signals is not verified. \n\nNonetheless, the second condition for the homogeneity verification was simultaneously \n\nanalysed and the statistical measures needed for that were calculated and are summarized in Table 6.11. \n\nFor the present batch the relative standard deviation is 2.8 %, considerably higher than the 1 % \n\nestablished for the homogeneity criteria and, consequently, none of the criteria is fulfilled and the batch \n\nis not considered homogeneous. \n\nFigure 6.5 \u2013 Homogeneity analysis of the batch of dosimeters used in the Fading Test. The circles represent each dosimeter \n\nEPR signal obtained from the four measurements done along the day in a rotational schedule and the red error bars represent \n\nthe standard deviation associated to the four measurements of each dosimeter. The light blue and dark blue dashed lines indicate \n\nthe 2 % and 3 % variation, respectively, from the whole batch EPR signal mean value (full blue light) that is one of the criteria \n\nused to conclude about the homogeneity.   \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  6  |  R E S U L T S  A N D  D I S C U S S I O N  \n\n \n\n61 \n\n \n\nTable 6.11 \u2013 Overall analysis of the batch to be used in the \n\nLinearity Test.

FADING ANALYSIS \n\nOnce the irradiations were completed, all groups of dosimeters were carried back from \n\nSkandionKliniken (Uppsala) to Link\u00f6ping where all EPR signal measurements were performed in the \n\nsame day. Each dosimeter signal was read four times in a rotating schedule and its individual signal \n\nwas obtained as the average of those four measurements.  \n\nThe absorbed doses mentioned in this section only refer to the ones received by the clinical \n\nproton beam and do not account the 3 Gy pre-absorbed in the homogeneity test. Additionaly, the EPR \n\nsignal values presented already account the ICF correction.  \n\nThe first analysis made was regarding each of the irradiated groups and the main results are \n\npresented in Table 6.12.  \n\nTable 6.12 - Summary of the measured EPR signals to each of the groups irradiated over the weeks in the Fading Test. For  \n\neach group the average signal of the four dosimeters belonging to the respective group is presented as well as the associated \n\nstandard deviation and relative standard deviation. In addition, all groups\u2019 signals were normalized to the last group irradiated \n\n- Group f to calculate the relative EPR signal and, from this value, the percentage of the occurred fading was also calculated. \n\n  Group \nDays after \n\nIrradiation \n\nAverage  \n\nEPR signal \n\nStandard \n\nDeviation (%) \n\nRelative Standard \n\nDeviation (%) \n\nRelative  \n\nEPR Signal \n\nFading  \n\n(%) \n\nf 2 2.077 2.3 1.1 1.000 0.0 \n\ne 3 2.075 4.3 2.1 0.999 0.1 \n\nd 10 2.010 1.7 0.8 0.968 3.2 \n\nc 17 1.996 2.6 1.3 0.961 3.9 \n\nb 24 1.943 2.1 1.1 0.935 6.5 \n\na 31 1.944 5.7 2.9 0.936 6.4 \n\n \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  6  |  R E S U L T S  A N D  D I S C U S S I O N  \n\n \n\n62 \n\n \n\nFor each group the average EPR signal was calculated as well as the standard deviation and the \n\nrelative standard deviation associated to the four dosimeters of each group. Also, considering the last \n\ngroup irradiated as the reference group to which highest EPR signal measured is associated, all the \n\naverage signal groups were normalized with respect to that group. To calculate the relative EPR signals \n\nfor each group (???? ?), Equation 6.13 was used. \n\n???? ? =\n? ????? ?\n\n? ????? ?\n                                     (Equation 6.13) \n\nAdditionally, the relative EPR signal can also be used to quantify the fading that has occurred. \n\nSo, using Equation 6.14, the values of the average fading that occurred in each group (? ????? ?) were \n\ncalculated and are also presented in Table 6.12. \n\n? ????? ? (%) = (1 ? ???? ?) \u00d7  100                               (Equation 6.14) \n\nIn both Equations 6.13 and 6.14, the variable ???? ? corresponds to the average relative signal \n\nof the group i to which the relative signal or the fading are being calculated. \n\nFrom the results, there is a decrease of the relative EPR signal as the time between the \n\nirradiation and the readout increases or, in other words, an increase of the signal fading.  \n\nRegarding the relative standard deviation of each group, the values vary quite randomly and \n\nthis change does not appear to be related with the time after irradiation but to some other factors like, \n\nfor example, the spectrometer instabilities or the fact that, during the irradiation process, the dosimeters \n\nmight not have absorbed the exact same dose. \n\nConsidering the relative signal, during the 31 day period, there was a maximum fading of 6.5 \n\n% associated to the dosimeters of Group b, slighly higher than the fading of 6.4 % associated to Group \n\na \u2013 the first to be irradiated. Yet, it is not certain that the fading was higher in Group b dosimeters due \n\nto the higher relative standard deviation associated to Group a EPR signals which indicated that it might \n\nexist one or more dosimeters in that group that vary considerably from the others and that may be \n\nleading to an misrepresentative increase or decrease of the average signal. The same situation might \n\nalso occur with group e that has a relative standard deviation of 2.1 %.  \n\nFor the remaining groups, the relative standard deviation is no bigger than 1.3 % indicating that \n\nthe dosimeters signals within those groups do not vary much from the calculated average signal and, \n\ntherefore, that average signal of the group is a good representative of the signals of the respective \n\nindividual dosimeters. \n\nThe small variations in the dose absorbed by each group of dosimeters in the successive weeks \n\nwere not corrected for the following study of the fading process because the dose response of the system \n\nwas not studied for the present batch of dosimeters and, has it was verified previously, the dose response \n\nbehaviour may vary slightly from batch to batch. Either way, the absorbed dose difference are quite \n\nsmall and can be considered negligible. \n\nWith this in mind, to verify how the individual relative signals within each group vary and to \n\nget a general view of the relation between this variable and the time after the group irradiation, all the \n\nrelative signals are presented in Figure 6.6.  \n\nThe dosimeters relative signals are represented by the \u201c+\u201d symbol and the regression to which \n\nthey were best fit into is represented by the dark full line. The represented regression approximately \n\ngoes through each of the groups average signal so it is easy to take conclusions on how well the average \n\ngroup signals represent the individual EPR signals belonging to that same group. \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  6  |  R E S U L T S  A N D  D I S C U S S I O N  \n\n \n\n63 \n\n \n\nIt is possible to identify easily each irradiated group by the four \u201c+\u201d symbols vertically aligned \n\nover the respective time after irradiation and, from the left to the right, the groups correspond to Group \n\nf, Group e, Group d, Group c, Group b and Group a. \n\nFor most groups, the dosimeters signals are close and well spread around its mean value and \n\nthe regression is a good representative of the relative EPR signals obtained in those groups. However, \n\nfor other groups the dispersion is visibly bigger, which is coherent with the group analysis previously \n\nmade, where the possibility that there was one or more dosimeters signals deviating more from the \n\nothers in Group e and Group a was placed.  \n\nAlso coherently with the group analysis, Figure 6.6 expresses in a very clear way the appearant \n\nrelative signal decrease as the time between the irradiation and the signal readout increases.  \n\nThe observed fading is very well supported by the polynomial regression, given by Equation \n\n6.15, that best fits the experimental data. This regression considers the time after irradiation (?) as the \n\ndependent variable that can be used to predict the relative signal (? ???) of any dosimeter. \n\n? ??? = (6.012 ? 10\n?5) ?2  ? (4.275 ? 10?3) ? + 1.009            (Equation 6.15) \n\nThe correlation between the two variables is given by the adjusted R-squared, which was \n\ncalculated and takes the value of 0.723. Though most of the data points are well represented and fall \n\nnear the regression, following the polynomial behaviour and supporting the relation between the fading \n\nincrease over the time, some data points fall quite far from the estimated regression and, consequently, \n\nFigure 6.6 - Relation between the relative EPR signal of the dosimeters and the time between irradiations and signal \n\nmeasurement. Each dosimeter signal is represented by the + symbol and the best fitting regression model is represented by the \n\nfull dark line. Considering the uncertainties associated to that regression, the 95 % and 99 % confidence intervals are also \n\nplotted by the dashed red and green lines, correspondingly. \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  6  |  R E S U L T S  A N D  D I S C U S S I O N  \n\n \n\n64 \n\n \n\nthe R-squared value is not as close to 1 as it would be desired. Either way, overall, the regression can \n\nexplain most of the observed data variability and the relation between the time after the irradiation and \n\nthe obtained relative signal is clear. \n\nConsidering the existence of signal fading and the period of two days between the last \n\nirradiation day and the EPR readouts day, it is likely that a minimal fading have occurred during this \n\nperiod and this can also be considered if signal corrections regarding the signal fading are ought to be \n\ndone. From Equation 6.15, the relative signal associated to the irradiation day was estimated and takes \n\nthe value of 1.009, which indicates that there was a 0.9 % fading between day 29 \u2013 last irradiation day \n\n- and day 31 \u2013 EPR readouts day. Yet, for the present analysis this will not be accounted because it is a \n\nestimation and not real data measured. \n\nAny estimation has an uncertainty associated due to the EPR signal uncertainties and due to the \n\nresidual standard error of the regression used and the residual standard error of the regression quantifies \n\nthe residuals between the values estimated by the regression and the real obtained values. For the present \n\nregression it takes the value of 1.6 % which is a very optimistic result. \n\nA more detailed analysis was made to calculate the individual estimation errors associated to \n\nevery dosimeter susing Equation 6.2. As mentioned before, this quantity evaluates the difference \n\nbetween the measured relative EPR signal and the estimated ones by the obtained regression for each \n\nindividual case, comparatively to the first. The main analysis to the individual percent errors calculated \n\nis listed in Table 6.13. \n\nTable 6.13 - Summary of the results regarding the error of the \n\nrelative signals estimation for every dosimeter. The minimum and \n\nmaximum percent errors are presented and the amount of estimated \n\nsignals with associated error lower than 1 % and 2 % (in comparison \n\nwith the measured signals) are counted.   \n\nMinimum Error (%) 0.1 \n\nMaximum Error (%) 4.2 \n\nNumber of Estimated Signals \n\nwith Error &lt;1 % \n12/24 \n\nNumber of Estimated Signals \n\nwith Error &lt;2 % \n21/24 \n\n \n\nFor half of the dosimeters of the batch, the error between the real relative signal and the \n\nestimated value by the regression is lower than 1 %. When considering a maximum error of 2 % for the \n\nestimation, 21 of the total 24 dosimeters fulfil the criteria. So, coherently with the small residual \n\nstandard error associated to the regression, it is now verified that most of the point estimations have, in \n\nfact, a considerably low percent error associated which is a great indicator of the accuracy of the \n\nestimations to be made. \n\nThe three dosimeters whose estimation errors are bigger than 2 % can be easily identified in \n\nFigure 6.6 and correspond to the dosimeters signals that fall more far from the regression line: one \n\nbelonging to group e and two dosimeters belonging to group a. In fact, it was already expected that the \n\nsituations to which the regression would produce less accurate estimations would be associated to any \n\ndosimeter from the groups with the highest relative standard deviations in Table 6.12. \n\nMaking the association with the dosimeters in Figure 6.6, the highest estimation errors are: \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  6  |  R E S U L T S  A N D  D I S C U S S I O N  \n\n \n\n65 \n\n \n\n? 2.6 % - dosimeter represented by the highest \u201c+\u201d of group a \n\n? 3.1 % - dosimeter represented by the highest \u201c+\u201d of group e \n\n? 4.2 % - dosimeter represented by the lowest \u201c+\u201d of group a \n\nDespite these situations whose relative signals vary considerable from the other dosimeters of \n\nthe respective groups, their EPR signals are still valid and must be considered in the analysis.  \n\nThe direct application of this test is the possibility to predict how much a dosimeter EPR signal \n\nhas faded in a certain period of time so that, as a consequence, the EPR signal associated to the \n\nirradiation day can be calculated and the initial absorbed dose can be accurately estimated. In this way, \n\nit is important to estimate the confidence intervals regarding the relative signals estimations and the \n\nfading estimations. \n\nConsidering the residual standard error associated to the estimated polynomial regression, the \n\n95 % confidence interval of the relative EPR signal (? ??? 95 % ??) that is delimited by the red dashed \n\nlines in Figure 6.6 is expressed in Equation 6.16.  \n\n? ??? 95 % ?? = ? ??? \u00b1 0.031                                   (Equation 6.16) \n\nThe confidence interval associated to the fading percentage (? 95 % ??) was obtained by \n\ncombination of Equation 6.13 and Equation 6.15 and is presented in Equation 6.17. \n\n? 95 % ?? (%) =  ? (%)\u00b1 3.1                                  (Equation 6.17) \n\nSo, the 95 % confidence interval produces fading estimations with an uncertainty of 3.1 %. \n\nWith an analysis of Figure 6.6, is possible to conclude that almost every dosimeter relative signal is \n\nwell included in the interval and there is only one situation that falls outside the 95 % confidence \n\ninterval. This is the dosimeter represented by the lowest \u201c+\u201d of Group a \u2013 read 31 days after the \n\nirradiation \u2013 and to which the highest estimation error was associated. \n\nThe same line of thinking was applied to obtain the 99 % confidence interval of the relative \n\nEPR signal, represented by the green dashed lines of Figure 6.6. The 99 % confidence interval equations \n\nof the relative signal (? ??? 99 % ??) and the fading (? 99 % ??) are Equation 6.18 and 6.19, respectively. \n\n? ??? 99 % ?? = ? ??? \u00b1 0.041                                  (Equation 6.18) \n\n? 99 % ?? (%) =  ? (%)\u00b1 4.1                                  (Equation 6.19) \n\nAn estimation with 99 % certainty results in an interval of amplitude 8.2 % that is a range much \n\nwider than what was desired to be considered meaningful. This amplitude is bigger than the maximum \n\nfading of 6.50 % registered for Group b which means that the estimated confidence intervals limits will \n\nbe too wide and might lead to erroneous conclusions. \n\nTo analyse the fading estimations and the respective 95 % and 99 % confidence intervals \n\nobtained from Equations 6.15, 6.14, 6.17 and 6.19, calculations regarding the time intervals studied in \n\nthe test were made and are presented in Table 6.14. No fading estimation was done regarding the \n\nreference group and the inferior limit of the intervals was set as 0 because any negative value means \n\nthat no fading occurred.  \n\nThe main problem associated to the wide confidence intervals is that, for example, a fading \n\nestimation of 2.8 % (associated to a time of 10 days between the irradiation and the readout) is easily \n\nincluded in the 95 % confidence interval calculated for 3, 10 or 17 days. If the 99 % interval is \n\nconsidered, the estimation is included in all the intervals estimated. However, considering that the \n\nconfidence intervals are used to include all possible abnormal fading situations, the wide range of the \n\nintervals is also considered as an advantage. \n\n \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  6  |  R E S U L T S  A N D  D I S C U S S I O N  \n\n \n\n66 \n\n \n\nTable 6.14 - Fading estimations, in percentage, associated to the days studied in the Fading Test with the \n\ncalculation of the respective confidence intervals.

Though, some studies concerning the fading in alanine were done. In \n\nthis topic, the study of the occurrence of decay in free-radical concentrations in alanine after high-LET \n\nirradiation stated that a considerable decay was observed after dose depositions from heavy charged \n\nparticle beams and that a bigger decay was found for higher LET radiation [22]. \n\nAlso, about the lithium formate system performance after proton irradiations, research indicated \n\nthat the interactions between proton radiation and matter were responsible for a lower EPR signal in \n\ncomparison to the EPR signal obtained after photon irradiations [23]. In the tracks of densely ionizing \n\nparticles, where the energy is deposited in the track at doses above saturation for radical production, the \n\nrate of radical recombination\u2019s is thought to be considerably bigger and, consequently, explains the \n\nlower signal obtained. \n\nThe results obtained in the Fading Test are obviously coherent with the previous researches \n\nbecause they confirm that after a heavy charged particle irradiation \u2013 using protons \u2013 there is in fact a \n\nnon-negligible signal decay. \n\nThis fading appears to be bigger in the first days after the irradiation and then, as the days go \n\nby, the fading rate appears to stabilize. As the fading in the signal of heavy particles is attributed to the \n\nradical recombination, an exponential decay of the signal would be expected. Yet, for the one month \n\nperiod tested, the polynomial regression was the one that best represented the data obtained.  \n\nAccording to studies made previously, it is believed that when increasing the experiment time \n\nand obtaining more data points, this exponential behaviour will become clear and the estimated \n\nregression will be used in any situation. \n\nConsequently, to confirm the fading behaviour more tests regarding this issue need to be done. \n\nNot only the repetition of the present test but also and the extension of the experiment duration to 3 or \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  6  |  R E S U L T S  A N D  D I S C U S S I O N  \n\n \n\n67 \n\n \n\n4 months, in which the regression best fitting the data is expected to be an exponential regression. The \n\npossibility to repeat the signals readouts 30 and 60 days after the first readout day was placed, however \n\nthat would insert one additional variable in the readout process and this would not be consistent with \n\nthe methodology followed in this test. \n\nThe experimental method used in the Fading Test based on several irradiations at different time \n\nintervals and only one readout started to be preferred in recent studies [19, 20, 21] because the absence \n\nof a reference sample allows a narrower sweep width7 of the EPR spectrum and thus more sampling \n\npoints concentrated over the signal of interest with a lower uncertainty associated. By performing two \n\nreadouts in different days a reference sample would be needed and the uncertainties would be bigger. \n\nSince the existence of signal fading after proton irradiation is validated, one factor that gains \n\nimportance and need to be considered in further studies is the time between the irradiations with the \n\nproton beams and the EPR signal measurements. Ideally, the EPR signals should have been read \n\nimmediately after the last irradiation but, since the irradiation facilities and the EPR spectrometer \n\nequipment are located in different cities8, this is still not possible and the best solution is to perform the \n\nsignal measurements in the day after the irradiation. \n\nContrarily to what was found for the lithium formate dosimeters signal after photon beam \n\nirradiations, the signal upcoming the dose absorption from a clinical proton beam is less stable and \n\ndecreases slightly with time. The most important application of knowing the fading behaviour is the \n\npossibility to estimate accurately the EPR signal that the dosimeter would present if the readout was \n\ndone in the same day of the irradiation and, from EPR value and knowing the dose response of the \n\ndosimetry system, estimate accurately the dose absorbed by the dosimeter. \n\n                                                           \n7 measure of the width of the frequency spectrum to be analysed \n8 The time travel between Uppsala and Link\u00f6ping in no less than 3 hours \n\n\n\n \n\n 68 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 69 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 7  \n\n \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK \n\n \n\n \n\nThe lithium formate EPR dosimetry system has been developed and methodically characterized \n\nregarding its performance in proton therapy dose verifications.  \n\nWith all results analysed, the system in study is considered a very promising tool for several \n\nproton radiation dosimetry purposes not only because of its robustness but also for allowing very \n\naccurate radiation dose measurements, with uncertainties under the limit accepted in dose delivery \n\nprocesses. Nevertheless, contrarily to what was verified in the lithium formate system tests with photon \n\nradiation where no signal fading exists nor temperature dependence, more factors appear to influence \n\nthe system behaviour when the radiation dose is delivered by a proton beam. So, a greater attention \n\nshall be given to these factors to optimize the lithium formate system utilization.  \n\nOne certainty of the characterization is the linear relation between the absorbed dose and the \n\nEPR signal for doses between 0 and 9 Gy, commonly used in radiotherapy, and the fact that this relation \n\ncan be accurately estimated with only two groups of data points. The second main conclusion is the \n\noccurrence of fading of the EPR signal of the dosimeters with time when the dose is absorbed from \n\nheavy charged particles like protons. \n\nRegarding the proton irradiations, the dose was delivered in only one irradiation similarly to \n\nwhat was done in the system tests with photon beam irradiations. However, this resulted in noticeable \n\nEPR signal differences among the dosimeters irradiated which was justified with a non-homogeneity \n\nof the proton dose delivered throughout the irradiation field. In this way, as the proton beam is not as \n\nhomogeneous as the photon beam, for further tests with proton beams it is advised to rotate the phantom \n\n90? after each quarter of the total irradiation time so that each dosimeter is exposed to the exact same \n\nirradiation characteristics. \n\nMoreover, considering all results obtained, the use of one group only pre-irradiated with photon \n\nradiation as the zero-dose point group for the calibration regression estimation is questioned. Unless the \n\nEPR signal is read right after the proton irradiation, all dosimeters irradiated with protons are likely to \n\nexperience some fading resulting in lower EPR signals in comparison to the real EPR signals associated \n\nto the respective absorbed doses, while the group only pre-irradiated in the homogeneity test does not \n\nexperience any fading. So, this variable must be eliminated and all groups must be exposed to the proton \n\nbeam, even if the absorbed dose by the zero-dose group is minimal. Once the fading behaviour is \n\nestablished by more tests similar to the one made in this project, a fading correction can be introduced \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  7  |  C O N C L U S I O N S  A N D  F U T U R E  W O R K  \n\n \n\n70 \n\n \n\nand the signals from the dosimeters irradiated only with photons can be corrected as if they had \n\nexperienced some fading.  \n\nSo, the fading phenomenon gains a huge importance if the best performance of the lithium \n\nformate EPR dosimetry system in proton radiation clinical verifications is wanted. Not considering the \n\nexistence of fading, the measured EPR signals may not correspond to the real EPR signal \u2013 right after \n\nthe irradiation \u2013 and, consequently, erroneous conclusions about the absorbed dose might be taken. \n\nConsequently, this phenomenon must be fully understood an to do so, a deeper investigation regarding \n\nthe fading process is required in the future. \n\nAccording to previous studies, the existence of fading is justified with the radical recombination \n\nthat is characterized by an exponential behaviour. Though this was not the obtained regression in the \n\nFading Test, an exponential behaviour is expected if a longer period is analysed. So, for a fully \n\ncharacterization of the fading process, it is of the utmost importance to repeat this investigation, test the \n\nfading behaviour for different absorbed doses, extend the experiment to at least 3 to 4 months and verify \n\nif it is possible to generalize the fading behaviour to all lithium formate dosimeters. \n\nWith all these factors considered the performance of the lithium formate system will certainly \n\nbe improved and lead to even better and more accurate results. So, other tests and applications can and \n\nshould be considered. \n\nAs important as the characterization of the system is the verification of its suitability to \n\ndetermine the absorbed doses in points at different depths and under different materials similar to the \n\nhuman body tissues \u2013 different stopping power ratios -, to simulate measurements within the human \n\nbody, the main purpose of radiation dosimetry in radiotherapy.  \n\nThese tests already started to be planned but no accurate conclusions can be taken until the \n\nstopping power ratio of the lithium formate dosimeters in proton irradiations is known (and \n\nconsequently the water to tissue equivalence of the material), so that the results can be compared with \n\nMonte Carlo simulations or with the results obtained by the ionization chamber. Until this moment, due \n\nto the non-existence of information regarding the stopping power ratio of lithium in proton beams and \n\ndue to the small dimensions of the dosimeters created, it was not possible to calculate the wanted \n\nquantity either theoretically or experimentally. Thus, the determination of the stopping power ratio in \n\nproton beam irradiations of the lithium formate mixture used to produce the dosimeters is one of the \n\npriorities before further tests with these dosimeters shall be made. \n\nDespite the need to make dose verifications is human phantoms, the lithium formate EPR \n\ntechnique is not being developed as an alternative dosimetry systems used for daily purposes but to \n\nother applications where the high accuracy and precision of the measurements are prioritized and, in \n\nthis matter, the presented system might become one of the best options available.  \n\nTough the readout process is quite time consuming and the result is not presented directly, this \n\nsystem was shown to have a linear dose response over large dose ranges and over the ranges used in \n\nradiotherapy procedures and for allowing the EPR signal reading multiple times without any \n\nconsequence for the dosimeter or the signal itself. These are clear advantages over other passive \n\ndosimeters like the ones used in thermoluminescence dosimetry. Additionally, contrarily to ionization \n\nchamber dosimetry, no connecting cables are required so the dosimeters can be used for various \n\nmeasurement situations without being influence by the beam direction.  \n\nThe other great advantage to some of the other dosimetry techniques is the possibility to use \n\ntissue equivalent materials as the dosimeter material. In particular, the choice of using lithium formate \n\nas the dosimeter material, a material with scattering and absorption properties very equivalent to the \n\nbody tissues properties, allows more accurate and precise measurements of the absorbed doses in \n\nradiation qualities different from the radiation quality used for calibration of the dosimetry system. \n\n\n\n    \nC H A P T E R  7  |  C O N C L U S I O N S  A N D  F U T U R E  W O R K  \n\n \n\n71 \n\n \n\nWith the research developed in the present dissertation, the great expectations for the lithium \n\nformate EPR dosimetry system were corresponded and, though more research still needs to be done \n\nregarding its use for proton beam dose verifications, there is no doubt that the dose measurements \n\nperformed with this system are of great accuracy and precision. So, this alternative dosimetry system is \n\na very promising tool for the verification and increase of the precision with which the dose is delivered \n\nto the patients in radiation therapy and also in proton therapy, approaching the main aim of radiation \n\ndosimetry.  \n\n\n\n \n\n 72 \n\n\n\n \n\n 73 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY \n\n \n\n \n\n[1]  B.
