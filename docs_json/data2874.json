The geologic history of\noceanic basins clearly indicates that the South Pacific is an\nimportant centre of origin and migration for ostracodes being\ncorroborated by high levels of diversity because the earliest\nstratigraphic records of some extant taxa are from that area\n(Whatley &amp; Ayress, 1988).\n\nThe dispersal mechanisms of marine benthic species\nespecially, are a recurrent research focus in ostracodology.\nBecause podocopid ostracodes lack planktic larvae, many\nhypotheses have been proposed to explain how and when\ndifferent taxa overcome potential zoogeographical barriers,\nin both shallow water and oceanic basins. It is traditionally\nassumed that the shallow water faunas present a high degree\n\nof endemism, while the deep sea taxa are predominantly\npandemic. Although these general principles remain valid,\nrecent studies have presented evidence that indicate this, in\npart, must be reevaluated. At the core of that discussion is\nthe problem of taxonomic misinterpretation which may, for\ninstance, increase the zoogeographical range of a species\nwhile in fact those records might combine distribution data\nof two or more taxa (Jellinek et al., 2006; Schornikov, 2005). It\nis important to point out, however, the existence of species\nfor which broad geographical range is appropriate.  A faunal\nsimilarity between the South Pacific and Southeast Atlantic,\nfor instance, has been noticed by Bergue et al. (2006) who\nrecorded species such as Cytheropteron lobatulum Ayress\net al. 1996 and Phyloneptunus provocator Jellinek &amp;\nSwanson, 2003 in deep waters off the SW Brazilian\ncontinental margin. Those occurrences show that migration\nroutes have been established between those two regions\nsome time during the Quaternary.\n\nStudies on deep sea faunas by Carmo &amp; Sanguinetti (1995,\n\n\n\nREVISTA BRASILEIRA DE PALEONTOLOGIA,10(3), 2007152\n\nPR\nOV\n\nAS\n\n1999), Drozinski et al. (2003), Bergue et al. (2006) and Bergue\net al. (2007) have contributed to a more precise knowledge of\nBrazilian marine bathyal ostracodes. The first occurrence of\nsome taxa in Brazilian waters such as Cluthia Neale, 1973,\nPoseidonamicus Benson, 1972, Rimacytheropteron Whatley\n&amp; Coles, 1987 and Clinocythereis Ayress &amp; Swanson, 1991,\nimproved both the taxonomy and paleozoogeographical\nunderstanding of South Atlantic ostracode faunas. As a\nfurther contribution to that data base, this article describes\nJavanella sanfordae sp. nov. and discusses the validity of\nthis genus based on occurrences recorded in the literature\nand examination of type material and the resultant\nimplications for some aspects of the zoogeographical and\nstratigraphical distributions of Javanella.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nThe samples studied were taken from two piston cores\nfrom the upper slope of Brazilian southeast continental\nmargin: SAN 26 (384 m water depth, lat. 23\u00ba42\u2019 S, long. 42\u00ba21.1\u2019\nW) and SAN 23 (630 m water depth, lat. 23\u00b049.5\u2019S, long.\n42\u00b017.8\u2019W) (Figure 1). Each of these samples of approximately\n20 grams was prepared using conventional\nmicropaleontological techniques with extracted specimens\nbeing imaged using both  SEM and traditional optical\nmicroscopy. More detailed information relating to core length\nrecovery, sedimentology and samples can be found in Bergue\net al. (2006). The type material of Pellucistoma kendengensis\nBold, 1950, housed in the Museum of Natural Science of\nLouisiana State University under the acronym HVH 4029,\nwas analyzed by the first author in optical microscopy. The\ntype material of Javanella sanfordae sp. nov. is housed at\nthe Ostracoda Section of Museu de Paleontologia of the\nUniversidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (MP-O), under\nthe curatorial numbers MP-O-1794, 1795, 1796 and 1870.\nAbbreviattions: C, carapace; V, valve; LV, left valve; RV, right\nvalve; l, length; h, height; w, width.\n\nSYSTEMATIC DESCRIPTIONS\n\nOrder Podocopida M\u00fcller, 1894\nSuborder Podocopina Sars, 1866\n\nSuperfamily Cytheracea Baird, 1850\nFamily Cytheridae Baird, 1850\n\nJavanella Kingma, 1948\n\nType species.

The valve surface of P. kendengensis, moreover,\nis also thoroughly punctate. A comparison with the SEM\nphotographs presented by Gou &amp; Chen (1988) revealed minor\ndifferences in the structure of the hinge (more details see in\nDiscussion and Conclusions).\nOccurrence. SAN 26 sample 19; SAN 23 samples 3, 4.\nDistribution. Late Pleistocene, Santos Basin (Brazil).\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe genus Javanella was proposed by Kingma (1948)\nbased only on two valves of late Pliocene samples from Java\nin the Indonesian Archipelago. Despite the scarcity of material,\nKingma mentioned that the morphologic characteristics of\nthe type species, Javanella kendengensis, were significantly\ndifferent from any other genus previously described.\n\n Unfortunately, in Kingma\u2019s  paper the two valves are\nillustrated using poorly detailed pen and ink drawings,\n\nhindering a more accurate determination of morphologic\nfeatures of the type material. The muscle scar pattern was\nnot described, probably as a result of the poor preservational\nstate of his specimens and there is not detailed information\non the hinge structure. Additionally, the holotype and the\ntype locality are not indicated.\n\nKeij (1979), in a short paper, presented a brief review of\nsome taxa studied by Kingma (1948), including the new genus\nJavanella. In that scientific note he showed SEM\nphotographs of the two valves of J. kendengensis Kingma,\n1948 and presented both a lectotype and a diagnosis for this\ngenus. However, in his concluding remarks he pointed out\nthe necessity of a more complete review of this genus, which\nin his opinion was a distinct Indomalayan taxon.\n\nPerhaps for the above reasons, the validity of Javanella\nhas been questioned by some ostracodologists. Both the\nclassical Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology-Part Q\n(Benson et al., 1961) and Bold (1950, 1958), refer it as a junior\nsynonym of Pellucistoma Coryell &amp; Fields, 1937, which\nexplains why this genus is classified by some authors (e.g.\nWarne et al., 2006) as a Paradoxostomatidae. Although the\nparadoxostomatids have a variable range of carapace\nmorphologic features, the taxonomy of this family is also\nstrongly based on soft part anatomy (McKenzie, 1969). For\nthat reason the present authors have the opinion that the\nmaintenance of Javanella in the family Cytheridae, as firstly\nassigned by Kingma (1948), is more sensible, as far as\ncarapace studies are considered.\n\nThere are only a few records of Javanella in the literature\n(Figure 3), and according to Kempf\u2019s Index and Bibliography\non Marine Ostracoda (Kempf, 1986, 1995) there are only three\nspecies formally described.

Those authors argue that the\nwell developed terminal hinge elements and more elongate\ncarapace are more related to Javanella than Paracytheroma.\n\nA worthy contribution to the Javanella issue was given\nby Gou &amp; Chen (1988) who studied the distribution of Saida\nHornibrook, 1952 and Javanella from the Pliocene of Leizhou\nPeninsula, China, presenting a redescription of J.\nkendengensis based both on SEM and optic microscopy\nphotographs. In that article the figures show clearly most of\nthe morphologic features omitted in the Kingma\u2019s drawings,\nsuch as the central muscle scars, vestibulae and marginal\npore canals. There is also an improvement in the hinge\ndescription, for Kingma\u2019s description does not mention the\npresence of teeth, which are clearly visible not only in Gou &amp;\nChen (1988) but also in the Brazilian specimens.\n\nAs a result of our consideration of the published data\n(Table 1) and the results of the study of the Brazilian material,\nwe now consider Javanella as a valid taxon because, as a\nwhole, it possesses a number of morphological features which\ndistinguish it from any other described genus, in particular\nthe hinge pattern. The present authors, however, disagree\nwith Howe &amp; McKenzie\u2019s taxonomic reassignment, and\nconsider the Australian species proposed by Hartmann (1978)\nas Paracytheroma species due to the general outline, the\nnumber of marginal pore canals and the central muscle scars.\nIn this sense, the Javanella occurrence registered by Warne\net al. (2006), in Shoal Bay, Australia is probably\nParacytheroma caudata Hartmann, 1978.\n\nAs stated before, few published studies mention the\noccurrence of Javanella and all of them in the SE Asia/\nAustralia region, the only exception being Bold\u2019s (1950)\nrecord of Pellucistoma kendengensis (sic) in the Miocene of\nVenezuela. Surprisingly, there are other  Caribbean faunal\nelements present in southeast Brazilian bathyal depths such\nas Heinia sp. and Nunana vandenboldi Aiello &amp; Szeczechura,\n2001 (Bergue et al., 2006), and similarities between Neogene\nCaribbean and Brazilian tropical shallow water ostracode\nspecies have been reported by Coimbra et al. (1999). Bold\u2019s\ntype material of Pellucistoma kendengensis (sic), has been\nexamined by the senior author who concluded that it is not\nco-specific with the Kingma\u2019s species (Figure 2L).\nUnfortunately, this material could not be coated for SEM\nanalysis and some morphological details were not properly\nexamined. The optical microscopy analysis showed that the\nBold\u2019s species is quite different from both Javanella\nkendengensis and J. sanfordae sp. nov. and possibly belongs\nto another genus.\n\nThe data available are not sufficient to elucidate if the\nmigration route of this genus from the Pacific Ocean was\nthrough the Drake Passage, in the south, or earlier than the\nelevation of the Isthmus of Panama, in the middle Pliocene (4\nto 3 Ma). That tectonic and vicariant event has been identified\nto coincide with morphological changes in large populations\nof ostracodes occurring on both sides of the isthmus as well\n\nas the differentiation of species of the genus Orionina Puri,\n1953 with small and isolated populations (Cronin, 1988; Cronin\n&amp; Schmidt, 1988). In fact, Allison &amp; Holden (1971) discussed\nthe distribution of some marine species from Clipperton Island\n(eastern tropical Pacific) whose oldest stratigraphical record\nwere in the Caribbean, as shown by Coimbra et al. (2004).\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors are indebted to Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro S.A.\n(Petrobras) for providing the samples used in this study, and\nto Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e\nTecnol\u00f3gico (CNPq), processes number 140091/01-7, 305537/\n2006-7 and 473971/2006-2, for the financial support.
