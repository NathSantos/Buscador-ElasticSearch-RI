Susceptibility to Leishmania donovani infection was compared in H\n(high antibody responder) and L (low antibody responder) mice from selection IV-A. H mice\ninfected intravenously with 107 amastigotes of L. donovani were more susceptible to infection\nthan their L counterparts. This higher susceptibility was characterized by a higher splenic and\nhepatic parasite burden. An increased splenic index was observed in both lines after sixty days\nof infection. This splenomegaly was caused, at least partially, by an increase in the number of\nsplenic cells as determined by  direct counts of cells from spleen. The results show that\nselection IV-A is susceptible to visceral leishmaniasis, with the H line being more susceptible\nthan the L line.\nKey-words: Leishmania donovani.

Important immunological features of\nvisceral leishmaniasis include circulating immune\ncomplexes12, polyclonal B-cell activation with\nelevated IgM and IgG levels1 5, immunosuppression\nand absence of detectable cell-mediated immunity\nduring acute infection13.\n\nHigh (H) and low (L) responder lines of mice\nprovide a useful model to investigate the\ncontribution of humoral and cellular immunity to\nimmune phenomena. H and Lantibody responder\nlines of mice were produced by bidirectional\nselective breeding of high and low responder lines\nof mice to natural multideterminant immunogens\nadministered at optimal doses. The diff e r e n t\nantigens used were sheep erythrocytes (SE)\nand pigeon erythrocytes (Selection I), SE only\n(Selection II), flagellar and somatic antigens of\nSalmonellae (Selections III and IV respectively),\nbovine serum albumin, and rabbit gamma\nglobulin (Selection V)3. Selection IV- A w a s\nderived from F2 interline segregants between\nHIV and LIV lines in response to SE 9. T h i s\na p p r o a c h  h a s  p e r m i t t e d  t o  e s t a b l i s h  t h a t\nquantitative antibody production is a polygenic\ntrait regulated by a group of about 10 independent\nloci2 14. The alleles separated in each line by\nselective breeding have a nonspecific effect,\noperating on the quantitative antibody response\nto many unrelated immunogens3. Fundamental\n\nimmunological differences of H and L lines have\nbeen described. The level of serum antibody is\nmarkedly higher in H than L lines and T cell-\nmediated immunity is of similar intensity in both\nlines1 8. It was also demonstrated that humoral\nand cell-mediated responses to the same\na n t i g e n s  a r e  s u b j e c t e d  t o  i n d e p e n d e n t\npolygenic regulation21. The importance of these\nimmunogenetic characteristics for the general\nstrategy of anti-infectious immunity has been\nhypothesized5. More recently, differences in T\nc e l l  p r o l i f e r a t i v e  r e s p o n s e s  a n d  c y t o k i n e\np r o d u c t i o n  b y  H  a n d  L l i n e s  h a v e  b e e n\ncharacterized10 22.\n\nThe resistance of H and L lines to various\nbacterial and parasitic infections has been studied.\nThese studies demonstrated that H mice are\nmore resistant than L mice to infections in which\nantibodies play a major protective role17 20. In\ncontrast, L mice are more resistant to infections\ncaused by intracellular pathogens11. Low antibody\nresponses in Lmice have been attributed to higher\ncatabolism of immunogens in the macrophages\nand consequent decreased antigen presentation\nby these cells. These macrophage catabolic\ndifferences have been previously demonstrated\nin selections I, II and IV-A16.\n\nConsidering that L. donovani is an intracellular\nparasite and that the macrophage function is\naltered in selection IV-A, the purpose of this\nstudy  was to evaluate the susceptibility of H and\nL mice from selection IV- A to infection with\nL. donovani.\n\nMATERIALAND METHODS\n\nAnimals. Twenty-nine H male mice and 29 L\nmale mice from selection IV-Aaged 8-10 weeks,\ndeveloped by the Immunology Section of the\nBiological Institute of S\u00e3o Paulo and maintained\nat the Animal Facility of the Department of\nMicrobiology and Immunology, Institute of\nBiosciences, UNESP, Botucatu, were used.\n\nP a ra s i t e s .  L .  d o no v a n i s t r a i n  1 S  w a s\nmaintained in vivo by serial passage in golden\nhamsters. Amastigotes for inoculation into mice\nwere obtained from the spleens of chronically\ninfected hamsters, washed three times in\np h o s p h a t e  b u f f e r e d  s a l i n e  ( P B S ,  p H  7 . 2 )\nand adjusted to a concentration of 5 x 10 7\namastigotes/ml.\n\nInfection. Thirty eight mice (19 H and 19 L)\nwere infected by the intravenous route with 107\namastigotes. Groups of 8 (4 H and 4 L) infected\n\nanimals were sacrificed at 15, 20, 30 and 60\ndays postinoculation and their spleens and livers\ncollected to evaluate the different parameters.\nSix mice (3 H and 3 L) were sacrificed 24 hours\nafter inoculation to establish the acute parasite\npopulation growth rate in the liver. Twenty non-\ninfected mice (10 H and 10 L) were used as\nnormal controls. \n\nHe pa t ic an d  s pl en ic par asi te burd e n .\nImpression smears from livers and spleens were\nstained with Giemsa to evaluate parasite burden.\nThe number of amastigotes per host cell nucleus\nwas determined by counting 1000 host cells as\npreviously described 6. The relative and total\nnumbers of parasites per organ, named Leishman-\nDonovan Units (LDU) and total Leishman-\nDonovan Units (total LDU). respectively, were\ncalculated according to the formula:\n\n\n\nnumber of parasites\n\n1000 host cell nucleus\nLDU = \n\nTotal LDU = LDU x organ weight (mg) x 2.105\n\nSplenic index. This index was determined\naccording to the formula:\n\nSplenic index =\n\nSplenic cell number. Spleens from normal\nand infected mice were removed and cell\nsuspensions prepared by teasing the material\nthrough a stainless steel sieve in PBS. The total\nnumber of cells was counted in a Neubauer\nchamber.\n\nStatistical analysis. The Kruskall-Wallis non-\nparametric test was performed to determine the\nstatistical significance of the data (p &lt;0.05 was\nconsidered significant).\n\nRevista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical 32:229-234, mai-jun, 1999.\n\n231\n\nRESULTS\n\nAcute growth rate of L. donovani in H and L\nmice from selection IV-A. Three and four mice\nfrom the H and L lines were killed after 1 and 15\ndays of infection, respectively. Liver parasite counts\non the first day showed no difference between H\nand L mice, with 138 LDU being the mean count\nfor both lines. After 15 days of infection the mean\nparasite burden  was 1803 and 1500 LDU for H\nand Lmice, respectively. These results, regardless\nof the later course of infection, characterized H\nand L mice from selection IV-A as intermediate\nin terms of acute susceptibility when compared\nwith inbred lines of mice experimentally infected\nwith L. donovani6.\n\nSplenic and hepatic parasite burd e n .

As can be observed in\nFigure 1a for the liver and 1b for the spleen, the\nparasitic burden was always higher in the H than\nin the L line. However, the difference between H\nand L was statistically significant only after 20\nand 30 days of infection. After 60 days of\ninfection, the last period evaluated, the parasitic\nburden was similar in liver and spleen of both\nlines.\n\nSplenic index. The splenic index in normal H\nmice was higher than in normal L mice. This\ndifference was preserved in infected animals\nand was statistically significant during all periods\nanalyzed (Figure 2a).

Also during this period\n\nthere was no alteration in total splenic cell\nnumber. However, both lines showed a striking\nincrease in total splenic cell number after 60\n\ndays of infection.

This result is similar to those\nobtained when the lines H and L were used as\nexperimental models for other intracellular\nparasites such as Leishmania tro p i c a4 a n d\nSalmonella typhimurium24 and Brucella suis11.\nIn our model we observed that after 20 and 30\ndays H mice were more susceptible than L mice\nsince H mice showed a significantly higher number\nof parasites both in spleen and liver. However,\nafter 60 days of infection the parasite burden\n\nwas equivalent in H and Lmice. In addition, after\n15 days of infection, the parasite burden in the\nl i v e r, which has been used as an index to evaluate\nacute susceptibility in experimental murine\nleishmaniasis6, was identical in H and L mice. It\nis possible that this difference  observed on the\n20th and 30th day of infection was caused by a\ndelay in developing a specific immune response\nable to partially restrain the parasite growth in H\nmice. This possibility finds some support in the\nfact that macrophages from the H line have a\nlower metabolic and bactericidal activity16. This\nmay consequently delay the ability of these\nmacrophages to present antigens to Th cells or\nto kill the intracellular leishmania amastigotes.\n\n\n\nRevista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical 32:229-234, mai-jun, 1999.\n\n233\n\nAnother parameter evaluated was the splenic\nindex. Interestingly, normal H mice already\npresented a significantly higher splenic index\ncompared to normal L mice and this difference\nwas maintained during infection. In each line\nthere was also an increase in the splenic index\nfrom the 30th day of infection on. This increase\nwas highly significant after 60 days of infection.\nSplenic hipertrophy is a classical description both\nin human and experimental kala-azar 18 and has\nbeen attributed to both monocyte recruitment23\nand polyclonal activation7. In our study we  found\na very pronounced increase in the splenic cell\nnumber at 60 days of infection in both mouse\nlines. This result shows that both lines from the\n\nIV-A selection, experimentally infected with L.\ndonovani, reproduce splenomegaly, which is the\nhallmark for visceral leishmaniasis.\n\nIn view of the significant difference between\nthe H and L lines from selection IV-A in terms of\nparasite burden after 20 and 30 days of infection,\nthe distinct immunological characteristics already\ndescribed for these two lines and the fact that\nthey represent extreme phenotypes found in a\nnatural heterogeneous (outbred) population, we\nbelieve that this model could be used to study\nthe macrophage-Leishmania interaction and the\nkinetics of the specific immune response to this\nparasite.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors thank Paulo Robeto Curi\nf o r  s t a t i s t i c a l   a n a l y s i s  a n d  P a u l o  S \u00e9 r g i o\n\nF e r r e i r a  f o r  a s s i s t a n c e  w i t h  t h e\nm a n u s c r i p t .\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
