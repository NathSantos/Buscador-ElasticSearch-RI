Um dos \n\nprincipais desafios desta \u00e1rea da biotecnologia \u00e9 a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de matrizes tridimensionais \n\nbiocompat\u00edveis e biodegrad\u00e1veis que sejam capazes de garantir um suporte f\u00edsico e \n\nbioqu\u00edmico adequado \u00e0 regenera\u00e7\u00e3o celular. Assim, as caracter\u00edsticas mec\u00e2nicas, \n\nqu\u00edmicas e biol\u00f3gicas destas matrizes devem ser adaptadas ao ambiente celular que se \n\npretende reproduzir, dando origem quer \u00e0 resposta celular espec\u00edfica das c\u00e9lulas \n\ncultivadas na matriz, quer \u00e0 otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o da resposta fisiol\u00f3gica do pr\u00f3prio organismo.   \n\nCom efeito, dependendo da fun\u00e7\u00e3o a que se destina, as matrizes usadas em \n\nengenharia de tecidos variam tanto no biomaterial que lhes d\u00e1 origem como na \n\nt\u00e9cnica de fabrica\u00e7\u00e3o utilizada. As vantagens dos pol\u00edmeros face aos outros materiais \n\ntais como biocompatibilidade, biodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o, alta porosidade e boas propriedades \n\nmec\u00e2nicas, tornam-nos no tipo de material mais utilizado na constru\u00e7\u00e3o de matrizes \n\ntridimensionais. \u00c9 o caso do copol\u00edmero PolyActive, j\u00e1 aprovado pela Food and Drug \n\nAdministration (FDA) e utilizado em m\u00faltiplas aplica\u00e7\u00f5es em engenharia de tecidos, \n\ncom especial destaque para a regenera\u00e7\u00e3o \u00f3ssea. A versatilidade deste pol\u00edmero est\u00e1 \n\nestreitamente relacionada com o r\u00e1cio dos segmentos qu\u00edmicos que o constituem, um \n\nsegmento hidrof\u00edlico de Politereftalato de etileno (PEOT) e outro hidrof\u00f3bico de \n\nPoli(tereftalato de butileno) (PBT), que ao ser modificado permite o controlo das \n\npropriedades mec\u00e2nicas e qu\u00edmicas do material. Por outro lado, a eletrofia\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 uma \n\nt\u00e9cnica de fabrica\u00e7\u00e3o que tem crescido em termos de popularidade pois permite o \n\nfabrico de matrizes fibrosas capazes de simular detalhadamente a topografia das fibras \n\nde colag\u00e9nio que comp\u00f5em a matriz extracelular natural.      \n\nTendo tudo isto em conta, neste estudo foram constru\u00eddas matrizes \n\ntridimensionais de PolyActive por eletrofia\u00e7\u00e3o capazes de modular e guiar a resposta \n\ncelular a partir de recursos topogr\u00e1ficos e bioqu\u00edmicos. A topografia das matrizes foi \n\ncontrolada com a introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de el\u00e9trodos capazes de influenciar o campo el\u00e9trico e, \n\nassim, alinhar as fibras de PolyActive durante o processo de eletrofia\u00e7\u00e3o, que ocorreu \n\nnum ambiente controlado para garantir a reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o das propriedades das fibras. J\u00e1 a \n\nincorpora\u00e7\u00e3o de biomol\u00e9culas na superf\u00edcie das fibras foi conseguida a partir da \n\ninvestiga\u00e7\u00e3o de duas estrat\u00e9gias distintas.   \n\nNuma das abordagens, matrizes fibrosas de dois tipos de PolyActive \n\n(1000PEOT70PBT30 e 300PEOT55PBT45) foram expostas a irradia\u00e7\u00e3o ultravioleta (UV) \n\ncom o objetivo de introduzir grupos qu\u00edmicos na superf\u00edcie das fibras capazes de \n\naumentar a ades\u00e3o de biomol\u00e9culas. As diferen\u00e7as entre superf\u00edcies tratadas e n\u00e3o \n\n\n\n \n \n\ntratadas com UV foram analisadas com recurso \u00e0s t\u00e9cnicas de espetroscopia de \n\ninfravermelho m\u00e9dio com transformada de Fourier acoplada ao acess\u00f3rio de reflex\u00e3o \n\ntotal atenuada (ATR-FTIR) e de fotoeletr\u00f5es excitados por raios X (XPS). Os resultados \n\nmostram que os grupos funcionais resultantes da intera\u00e7\u00e3o da superf\u00edcie das fibras \n\ncom o UV dependem do r\u00e1cio PEOT/PBT e do conte\u00fado de Polietilenoglicol (PEG) \n\npresente no copol\u00edmero. Assim, as fibras de 1000PEOT70PBT30 (PA 1000) \n\napresentaram um grande n\u00famero de grupos carboxilo e hidroxilo na sua superf\u00edcie \n\ndevido \u00e0 degrada\u00e7\u00e3o do segmento de PEOT e da sua grande cadeia polim\u00e9rica de PEG \n\nap\u00f3s 40 minutos de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 radia\u00e7\u00e3o UV. Por sua vez, a matriz fibrosa de \n\n300PEOT55PBT45 (PA 300), quando sujeita ao mesmo per\u00edodo de irradia\u00e7\u00e3o UV, \n\noriginou p-benzoquinonas na superf\u00edcie das suas fibras devido ao alto teor cristalino da \n\nsua estrutura. Em ambos os casos, o tratamento UV aumentou as \u00e1reas de ades\u00e3o das \n\nprote\u00ednas oriundas do meio de cultura celular e por conseguinte a ades\u00e3o celular \n\ntornou-se tamb\u00e9m mais eficiente. Por\u00e9m, a resposta celular \u00e9 dependente n\u00e3o s\u00f3 das \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas das matrizes, mas tamb\u00e9m da linha celular utilizada. Por exemplo, as \n\nc\u00e9lulas Schwann de rato mostraram n\u00e3o s\u00f3 prefer\u00eancia pelas \u00e1reas ativadas pelo UV, \n\nmas tamb\u00e9m se mostraram sens\u00edveis a pequenas altera\u00e7\u00f5es do alinhamento das fibras \n\nresultantes das diferen\u00e7as entre os dois copol\u00edmeros. Foi tamb\u00e9m utilizada uma \n\nm\u00e1scara de n\u00edquel para controlar espacialmente a introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de novos grupos \n\nqu\u00edmicos nas superf\u00edcies das matrizes fibrosas de PA 300 e PA 1000.  \n\nA segunda estrat\u00e9gia apresentada consistiu na eletrofia\u00e7\u00e3o de fibras de PA 300 \n\ncom grupos qu\u00edmicos incorporados para uma funcionaliza\u00e7\u00e3o posterior. Basicamente, \n\numa solu\u00e7\u00e3o polim\u00e9rica composta por PA 300 e PEG com determinados grupos \n\nfuncionais numa propor\u00e7\u00e3o 4:1 foi sujeita ao processo de eletrofia\u00e7\u00e3o, originando \n\nfibras de PA 300 com os grupos funcionais do PEG na sua superf\u00edcie. Esta abordagem \n\ninovadora e in\u00e9dita possibilitou a sele\u00e7\u00e3o dos grupos funcionais localizados na \n\nsuperf\u00edcie das matrizes fibrosas e consequentemente o controlo do tipo de \n\nbiomol\u00e9culas que v\u00e3o aderir \u00e0s fibras. Neste estudo foram utilizados dois tipos de PEG \n\nfuncionalizado: PEG com terminais alcinos ((bis)PEG-Alkyne), que possibilitam a \n\ncicloadi\u00e7\u00e3o azida-alcino com biomol\u00e9culas que tenham a fun\u00e7\u00e3o azida; e PEG  com \n\ngrupos terminais de N-hidroxisuccinimida ((bis)PEG-SVA), que facilitam a liga\u00e7\u00e3o com \n\nprote\u00ednas. As superf\u00edcies das matrizes de PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA e de PA 300 + \n\n(bis)PEG-Alkyne foram analisadas recorrendo \u00e0s t\u00e9cnicas de ATR-FTIR e XPS. No \n\nprimeiro caso, os resultados provaram a exist\u00eancia de N-hidroxisuccinimida na \n\nsuperf\u00edcie das fibras, que depois foi confirmada com recurso a microscopia de \n\nfluoresc\u00eancia; relativamente \u00e0s matrizes de PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne, apesar das \n\nt\u00e9cnicas de espectrometria n\u00e3o produzirem resultados conclusivos, foi poss\u00edvel \n\nconfirmar a presen\u00e7a de alcinos na superf\u00edcie das fibras a partir das imagens de \n\nmicroscopia de fluoresc\u00eancia.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\nO sucesso da segunda abordagem permite abrir as portas ao aparecimento de \n\nnovas metodologias de design e fabrica\u00e7\u00e3o de matrizes biofuncionais, j\u00e1 que torna \n\nposs\u00edvel a simula\u00e7\u00e3o e controlo do ambiente bioqu\u00edmico que influencia as respostas \n\ncelulares de uma forma simples e eficiente.   \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\nAbstract \n \n\n The principal objective of a new generation of tissue engineering scaffolds is to \n\nreproduce the spatial and biochemical microenvironmental characteristics of the \n\nnatural extracellular matrix (ECM) with the purpose of modulating the cell response \n\nand consequently enhance tissue repair. There is an enormous variety of scaffolding \n\napproaches that highly depend on the biomaterial selection, on the fabrication \n\ntechnique used and on the specific function of the scaffold.       \n\n In this study, bioactive electrospun scaffolds made of PolyActive (Poly(ethylene \n\noxide terephthalate) / Poly(buylene terephthalate)  (PEOT/PBT)) copolymer, capable of \n\ncombining a spatially organized structure with bioactive factors, was developed. The \n\ndesign and fabrication strategies used to create the scaffolds allow the tailoring of the \n\nscaffold\u2019s function by manipulating the introduction of specific chemical groups on its \n\nsurface for further selective immobilization of complex biomolecules, resulting in the \n\ndesired cell response.  \n\n In one approach, the surface of both 300PEOT55PBT45 (PA 300) and \n\n1000PEOT70PBT30 (PA 1000) electrospun fibres were modified via UV exposure, \n\nresulting in the introduction of specific functional groups able to improve the protein \n\nadsorption process and consequently increase the available areas for cell attachment. \n\nA spatial definition of protein adsorption was accomplished by exposing the fibres via \n\npatterned mask.  \n\n An alternative strategy consisted of electrospinning PA 300 fibres with \n\nincorporated chemical groups for later functionalization. Alkyne and NHS-esters \n\nfunctional groups were successfully incorporated on the surface of the electrospun \n\nfibres via the introduction of specific PEG linkers ((bis)PEG-alkyne and (bis)PEG-SVA) in \n\nthe electrospinning blend solution. This innovative methodology can be adopted for \n\nmultiple tissue engineering applications since specific chemical groups can be \n\nintroduced onto the surface of electrospun fibres, leading to a meticulous selection of \n\nthe biochemical elements that will be adsorbed and consequently to a detailed control \n\nof the cell behaviour.   \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: tissue engineering scaffold; PolyActive; electrospinning; UV irradiation; \n\n(bis)PEG-SVA; (bis)PEG-Alkyne; protein adsorption; click chemistry; Attenuated Total \n\nReflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR); X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy \n\n(XPS).     \n\n\n\n \n \n\nTable of contents \n \n\nList of acronyms .......................................................................................................................... 13 \n\nList of figures ............................................................................................................................... 14 \n\nList of tables ................................................................................................................................ 16 \n\n1.

Introduction \n\nTissue engineering is an interdisciplinary area that applies the principles of \n\nclinical medicine, mechanical engineering and materials science to increase and \n\noptimize the body\u2019s natural response after tissue or organ damage. This field relies \n\nextensively in the use of 3D scaffolds able to provide suitable microenvironments that \n\nshould mimic the natural extracellular matrix, providing both topographical and \n\nchemical cues to enhance cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation towards new \n\ntissue formation.     \n\nCurrently, there are two major tissue engineering approaches. The most \n\npopular strategy follows the idea that the new tissue should come from an implant \n\nwith pre-cultured cells. In this approach, the seeded cells are usually isolated from the \n\nhost target tissue and they should proliferate in an appropriate 3D dimensional \n\nscaffold, before implantation. The other strategy explains that, immediately after \n\ninjury, an acellular scaffold should be implanted into the defect area. This particular \n\nscaffold should be functionalized with specific biomolecules able to recruit progenitor \n\ncells towards the injured area, and then promote their proliferation and differentiation \n\nwith the purpose of regenerating the wounded tissue. Both strategies can also be \n\ncombined since a functionalized scaffold can be useful in an ex-vivo situation by \n\ninducing cell seeding, proliferation and differentiation in order to encourage tissue \n\nformation after implementation in vivo. In this approach it is expected that the scaffold \n\ncould continue to release signalling molecules with the purpose of enhancing the \n\nregeneration of the defect area, even after implementation [1]. \n\nIn the light of these strategies, to achieve success in tissue engineering, it is \n\nnecessary to combine and balance the role of cells, scaffolds and biomolecules. To \n\naccomplish that, it is crucial that the scaffold not only provides the physical support, \n\nbut also the chemical agents that will modulate the injury microenvironment. \n\nGenerally, the scaffold for tissue engineering should present good levels of \n\nbiocompatibility and biodegradability as well as an architecture and mechanical \n\nproperties adapted to its specific purpose.  So, there are three main topics that should \n\nbe considered during the scaffold design: choice of the material, manufacturing \n\ntechnology and the final function of the scaffold.  \n\n1.1. Materials \n\nThe choice of a suitable material is a crucial step in the development of \n\nscaffolds for tissue engineering applications since the selected material will be \n\nresponsible for facilitating the generation of a useful size and volume of tissue, allow \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\nan efficient delivery of molecular and mechanical signals to the cells and it should also \n\nsupport the cells and optimize their function within the scaffold. In fact, as the goal of \n\nthe scaffold is to mimic the advantageous characteristics of the natural extracellular \n\nmatrix (ECM), the scaffolding material should present physical, chemical and biological \n\nproperties that enhance biocompatibility and biodegradability in order to avoid \n\nunwanted host tissue reaction of the immune system and the damage of the tissues \n\nvia toxic products, respectively [2,3,4].    \n\nSome of the most common categories of biomaterials used in the fabrication of \n\nscaffolds for tissue engineering are ceramics, natural polymers and synthetic polymers.  \n\nCeramic scaffolds are mostly used in bone regeneration applications, such as \n\ngrafting in bone replacement and coating metal implants, because of their mechanical \n\nstiffness, low elasticity and hard brittle surface. The most frequent biomedical ceramic \n\nis hydroxyapatite (HA) because of its structural and chemical similarity to the mineral \n\nphase of the native bone that assures biocompatibility as well as osteoblast \n\ndifferentiation and proliferation. However, ceramics also proved to be difficult to \n\nshape for implementation and tricky to adapt to other clinical applications due their \n\nbrittleness and porous network structure [5,6,7]. \n\nIn contrast to the ceramic scaffolds, polymers offer design flexibility since the \n\ncomposition, structure and arrangement of their constituent macromolecules can be \n\nadapted to different functions. Generally, polymers present appropriate properties for \n\ntissue engineering applications like biocompatibility, high surface-to-volume ratio, high \n\nporosity, biodegradation and good mechanical features [8]. There are two main types \n\nof polymers used as biomaterials: natural polymers and synthetic polymers.  \n\nThe natural polymers have a very elevated potential for achieving clinical \n\nsuccess because they normally exhibit high levels of biocompatibility, biodegradability \n\nand low immunogenicity, which consequently enhance the cells performance in the \n\nbiological systems. They can be classified as proteins (e.g. collagen and gelatin), \n\npolysaccharides (e.g. alginate and chitosan) or polynucleotides (DNA, RNA) [8,9]. \n\nNatural biomaterials, especially collagen based biomaterials, have been successfully \n\nused to support growth of axons and also to deliver multiple cell types into the \n\nnervous system after injury. Indeed, the importance of collagen in nerve regeneration \n\napplications can be exemplified by the three conduits made of collagen type I for \n\nperipheral nerve system regeneration already approved by the FDA (Food and Drug \n\nAdministration): NeuraGen\u00ae, Neuroflex\nTM\n\n and NeuroMarix\nTM\n\n [10]. Besides nerve tissue \n\nengineering, natural polymers are currently used in several areas of tissue engineering \n\nsuch as bone tissue engineering [11] and they are also utilized as DNA carriers for gene \n\ndelivery applications [12]. \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nRelative to the natural polymers, synthetic polymers offer some advantages \n\nwhich includes great design flexibility, reproducibility under controlled conditions and \n\nthe control of both physical and chemical material properties like porosity, \n\nbiodegradability and biocompatibility. In addition to this, they are cheaper and \n\nrepresent a more consistent source of raw materials than natural polymers; however \n\nthere is a higher risk of rejection due the reduced biocompatibility comparing with \n\nnatural polymers. Typically, the synthetic polymers used in tissue engineering \n\napplications are either hydrophobic biodegradable polyesters, such as polyglycolide \n\n(PGA), polylactide (PLA), poly(?-caprolactone) (PCL), or hydrophilic biodegradable \n\npolymers like Polyethylene oxide (PEO). Synthetic polymers can be easily combined in \n\norder to generate new biomaterials with desirable properties; in this way it is possible \n\nto create a material able to conjugate the mechanical properties of the hydrophobic \n\npolyesters with the cell affinity of the hydrophilic polymers. For example, poly-dl-lactic-\n\nco-glycolic acid (PLGA) is a very versatile and well studied synthetic copolymer that has \n\nshown very good performances in mimicking the microenvironment that supports the \n\ncells. Some applications include bone [13] and nerve tissue engineering [14]. In fact, \n\nsome copolymers like Degrapol\u00ae and PolyActive\u00ae have already found clinical use and \n\nare both already FDA approved.   \n\n1.1.1. PolyActive \n\nThe wide range of mechanical properties like elasticity, toughness and strength \n\nin combination with easy processability and high levels of biocompatibility offered by \n\nthe copolymers of poly(ethylene oxide terephthalate)-poly(buylene terephthalate) \n\n(PEOT/PBT), make this class of copoly(ether ester)s one top candidate for tissue \n\nengineering applications [15,16].  \n\nLike other segmented block copolymers, the properties of PEOT/PBT, are \n\ndetermined by the characteristics of the constituting segments: the hydrophilic \n\npoly(ethylene oxide terephthalate) segment adds the soft elastomeric, hydrogel-like \n\nbehaviour into the copolymer while the hydrophobic poly(buylene terephthalate) \n\nintroduces rigidity (Figure 1)[16,17].  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDeschamps et al. [16,18] have described the preparation of PEOT/PBT as a two \n\nstep polycondensation of polyethylene glycol (PEG), 1,4-butanediol and dimethyl \n\nFigure 1. Chemical structure of PEOT/PBT copolymers. Adapted from [15].  \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\nterephthalate (DMT) in the presence of titanium tetrabutoxide as catalyst and Irganox \n\n1330 as antioxidant. Firstly there is a transesterification of PEG, DMT and 1,4-\n\nbutanediol under a nitrogen atmosphere at 180?C, then after two hours, the pressure \n\nslowly decreases (from 1000 to 0.1mbar) and the temperature is, at the same time, \n\nincreased to 240?C in order to enable polycondensation. The composition of the block \n\ncopolymers is designated as aPEOTbPBTc, where a is the starting PEG molecular \n\nweight, b the weight percentage of PEOT and c the percentage of the PBT hard \n\nsegments. The soft segments weight contribution (b) is related not only with the \n\ncontribution of PEO (polyethylene-oxide) and the terephthalate ester units (T) present \n\nin the soft segments, but also with the starting PEG molecular weight (Table 1).  \n\n The variations in the soft and hard segments ratio and in the PEG\u2019s molecular \n\nweight used during the PEOT/PBT copolymers synthesis have different effects on the \n\nphase separation of the system and consequently in the tailoring of characteristics \n\nsuch as wettability [19,20], swelling [20], biodegradation rate [16,18], protein \n\nadsorption [19] and mechanical properties [16,20]. As the different macromolecules of \n\nblock copolymers are covalently linked, the macrophase separation is unable to occur; \n\nhowever, microphase separation can still happen [16]. Therefore, the phase separation \n\nwill be more distinct if there is an increase in PEOT length and in the PBT sequence \n\nwith further crystallization of these blocks or in the polymers that contain high \n\nmolecular weight PEG [16].  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n The swelling capacity and other polymer features like the flexible and plastic \n\nbehaviour are highly influenced by controlling the polymer mesh size, that is, the \n\neffective length of the soft segment between the physical crosslinks. Thus a larger PEO \n\ncontent will result in a larger network mesh size and consequently in an improvement \n\nin the swelling ability and viscoelastic parameters. In contrast, decrease of the elastic \n\nmoduli of the polymer will be noted [17,20].  \n\n The PEOT/PBT copolymers have been also extensively investigated in terms of \n\nin vitro and in vivo biocompatibility [18,21] and there are two major types of \n\nTable 1. PEO content (wt%) of PEOT/PBT copolymers produced with PEG of different molecular weights at diverse \nsoft to hard segment ratios. Adapted from [16].   \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\ndegradation process that can occur: hydrolysis of the ester bonds and oxidation of the \n\nether bonds [16]. Because of the PEOT/PBT molecular structure, the degradation \n\nmechanisms rates varies from very low for low PEG molecular weight and high PBT \n\ncontent to high for larger contents of PEOT and longer PEO segments [21]. \n\n During the hydrolytic degradation of the PEOT/PBT block copolymers in an \n\naqueous media (Figure 2), the hydrophilic domain is more accessible to water uptake; \n\nthis is because the ester bond present in the PEOT segment (ester A) is more liable to \n\nbe attacked by water due the great hydrophobicity of the PBT segments [22]. Firstly, \n\nthe hydrolysis will cause chain scissions of the PEOT segments and consequently \n\nprovoke an entanglement of the remaining chain molecules, which will then reorganize \n\nthemselves from a disordered state to an ordered state [22]. The continuous water \n\nabsorption and the presence of carboxyl acids, that are resulted from the reaction, will \n\ninitiate new chain scission events and eventually the ester bond in the crystalline \n\nregion (ester B) will be also attacked by water; ultimately, the whole molecule is \n\nbroken into pieces [16,22].             \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nUnlike hydrolysis, the PEOT/PBT oxidation mechanism can easily occur in the \n\npresence of air and, similarly to other polymers containing PEO, it originates scission of \n\nthe polymer chain via free radical reactions [16]. These radicals are usually produced \n\nby photonic activation of chromophores, which can be present either as internal (in-\n\nchain) impurities such as hydroperoxides or carbonyls, or external impurities like \n\nFigure 2. Hydrolysis mechanism of PEOT/PBT in water: 1) The ester bond in the PEOT segment is attacked by water; \n2) The H from H2O joins to the oxygen atom in the OR\u2019 part of the original ester and the OH part of the H2O joins to \nR; 3) The products of the reaction are a carboxyl acid and an alcohol. \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\npolymerization catalyst residues or pollutants from the atmosphere [23,24]. Another \n\npossible sources of chromophores include unsaturated groups like C=O or C=C [25,26]. \n\nWhen the formation of the chromophoric radical occurs in the PEO segment, it \n\nwill lead to the formation of a macroradical in the polymer backbone by hydrogen \n\nabstraction of the carbon atoms in the ?-position to the oxygen. The macroradical will \n\nthen react with atmospheric O2 and produce an alkylperoxy radical (POO\n.\n).  After that, \n\na new abstraction of a labile hydrogen from the same neighbouring macromolecule \n\ncan lead to the formation of a hydroperoxide (POOH) that will be decomposed by \n\nthermal and photo degradation to generate an alkoxy radical (PO\n.\n) and a hydroxyl \n\nradical (HO\n.\n) (equation 1)[23,27]. An alternative pathway that describes the formation \n\nof the alkoxy radical is the recombinations of the alkylperoxy radicals following the \n\nRussell type mechanism [23,27,28]. This bimolecular recombination is described by the \n\nequation 2, where the peroxy radicals recombine and produce unstable tetraoxides (P-\n\nOOOO-P). At the end of the reaction mechanism, the P-OOOO-P decomposes to give \n\ntwo alkoxy radicals in a cage and an oxygen molecule (Figure 3) [23,27]. \n\n equation 1 \n \n\n equation 2 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Figure 3. Oxidation of PEO: formation of alkoxy radicals via photo (h?) and thermal (?) conditions. \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\n The reaction presented in equation 2 is more common during photo-oxidation \n\nof PEO; on the other hand equation 1 usually happens when the PEO thermo-oxidation \n\noccurs. After the formation of the alkoxy radical, the oxidation process may proceed by \n\nthree different pathways, depending on the environment conditions:         ?-scission, \n\nreaction with a hydroxyl radical and hydrogen abstraction reaction of alkoxy radical \n\n(Figure 4) [23,29].  \n\n The ?-scission of the radical leads to the formation of formate end groups that \n\ncan be produced directly from the scission or from a supplementary pathway, where \n\nthe oxidation of the macroradicals generated from the scission will lead to the \n\nformation of primary hydroporoxides. These primary hydroporoxides because of the \n\nthermal and photo-degradation will also produce formates [23].  \n\n Other alternative route leads to the formation of ester functions because of the \n\nreaction of alkoxy radicals with hydroxyl radicals under thermo-oxidative conditions. \n\nAlternatively, the alkoxy radical can be involved in a hydrogen abstraction reaction \n\nwhich will form a thermal unstable hemiacetal that will be decomposed to alcohols \n\nand carboxylic acids [23,29].  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Morlat et al. [23] have studied the PEO oxidation mechanism and concluded \n\nthat the photo-oxidative conditions favour the ?-scission of the alkoxy radicals and \n\nconsequently the generation of formats in a ratio of 5:1 against chain esters. On the \n\nFigure 4. Oxidation of PEO: formation of the final products via three different pathways. \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\nother hand, under thermo-oxidative conditions the production ratio of formates and \n\nesters are similar [23,30].  \n\n Besides the PEO oxidation mechanism, the PEOT segment can offer an \n\nalternative oxidation mechanism via the terephthalate ester units (Figure 5). The key \n\nevent in this degradation process is also the scission of the polymer main chain that \n\ngenerates carboxyl end groups, volatile products such as CO and CO2 and it can also \n\nproduce mono or dihydroxy terephthalates [31].  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Relative to the PBT segment, the oxidation process is a complex mechanism in \n\nwhich both photolytic and photo-oxidative reactions interfere [32,33]. The activation \n\nof the chromophore groups can lead to three direct photo-scission processes \n\n(equations 3, 4 and 5) that will generate primary radicals [32]. These radicals are able \n\nto provoke the oxidation of the carbon atom located in the ?-position to the oxygen \n\nester by abstraction of labile hydrogen atoms, leading to the formation of \n\nhydroperoxides. During photo-oxidation, there is also possible that some \n\nhydroperoxides are formed on the aromatic rings (Figure 6) [32,33].  \n\n \n\n equation 3 \n\n equation 4 \n\nFigure 5.

The alkoxy radicals located on the \n\naromatic ring are able to participate in a hydrogen abstraction reaction involving the \n\npolymer chain that will lead to the formation of mono and di-hydroxy-substituted \n\ncompounds [33,35]. These compounds can also be produced if the hydroxyl radicals, \n\noriginated from the O-O homolysis at the ester\u2019s ?-carbon, react with the aromatic \n\nrings of the PBT segment (Figure 7) [33]. The characteristic yellowing of the samples \n\ncontaining PBT can be related to the formation of these compounds and with their \n\nfurther degradation [36].  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Figure 7.

Fabrication Techniques \n\nThere are several techniques to shape polymers into advantageous, complex \n\nand reproducible scaffolds that exhibit useful properties for specific tissue engineering \n\napplications. The selection of one fabrication technique deeply depends on the desired \n\npurpose of the scaffold and the bulk and surface properties of the material. \n\nFibrous scaffolds are very popular since they can successfully mimic the \n\narchitecture of the native extracellular matrix at the nanoscale level. In fact, the \n\ndiameter of the nanofibres that form the scaffold apparatus ranges from 1 to 1000 nm, \n\nmatching the size scale of extracellular matrix fibres such as collagen (50 to 500 nm). In \n\naddition to this, the combination of the high surface area to volume ratio with the \n\nmicroporous structure of the nanofibres enhances cell adhesion, proliferation, \n\nmigration and differentiation [8,37,38]. There are three production methods that are \n\ncommonly used to produce fibrous scaffolds: phase separation, self assembly and \n\nelectrospinning.  \n\nPhase separation is a method used to build scaffolds by thermally inducing the \n\nseparation of a homogeneous polymer solution into a multiphase system, which \n\ncomprises a polymer-poor phase (low polymer concentration) and a polymer-rich \n\nphase (high polymer concentration). Generally, phase separation begins with a \n\npolymer dissolution that is followed by a liquid-liquid phase separation process. Then, \n\nthe upper critical temperatures originate both polymer-poor phase and polymer-rich \n\nphase via polymer gelation. At the end, the polymer-rich phase solidifies to form a \n\nmatrix and the polymer-poor phase originates pores due the solvent removal. The \n\nfibre diameter can be modulated by selecting appropriate gelling temperature (high \n\ntemperatures lead to microfibres and lower temperatures originate nanofibers); on \n\nthe other hand, the polymer concentration influences the mechanical properties \n\n(tensile modulus and tensile strength) of the fibres. Although the phase separation \n\ntechnique do not require specialized equipment and assures the desired shape for the \n\nscaffold, it can only be performed by a limited number of polymers (e.g. PLGA and \n\nchitosan) and it offers little control over the pre size distribution [37,38,39].    \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\n The self assembly process can be defined as an autonomous organization of \n\ncomponents such as biomolecules into complex structures due to noncovalent bonds \n\nor weak covalent interactions such as electrostatic, van der Walls and hydrophobic \n\ninteractions. So, in order to build fibrous scaffolds it is necessary that small units like \n\nproteins assemble into nanofibres with high aspect ratio, which can mimic the in vivo \n\nmicroenvironment of the cells. In fact, this approach can be applied in vivo in order to \n\ncreate a nanofibre system able to connect neighbouring cells and consequently \n\norganize a three dimensional network capable of mechanically support them. For \n\nexample, a peptide amphiphile (PA)-based-self-assembling system allows the \n\ngeneration of thermally stable protein-like nanofibres with the purpose of mimicking \n\nthe extracellular matrix; one possible application of this system uses the changes of \n\nthe microenvironment pH to induce self assembly processes for bone tissue \n\nengineering. However, self assembly is not a very common approach for tissue \n\nengineering purposes as it is limited to few polymers and it has low economic viability \n\n[37,38,39].       \n\nElectrospinning is the most popular fabrication technique to create fibrous \n\nsince it simpler and more cost effective, compared with both self assembly and phase \n\nseparation. Because of that, the electrospinning principles will be discussed in detail in \n\nthe following section. \n\n1.2.1. Electrospinning \n\nElectrospinning is a fairly time- and cost-efficient technique that is used to \n\nproduce ultrafine micro or nanofibres with considerable surface areas and porosity, \n\nflexibility in surface functionalities and advanced mechanical performance (stiffness \n\nand tensile strength).   \n\nThe equipment needed for the electrospinning process includes a syringe \n\npump, a high voltage source and a collector. The procedure is relatively simple and it \n\nbasically involves the formation of polymer fibres due to electrostatic repulsion of a \n\npolymer solution (Figure 8). At the beginning of the process, the polymer solution is \n\nheld to the needle tip of the syringe (spinneret) via surface tension. Then, the \n\nintroduction of an electric field originates mutual charge repulsion within the polymer \n\nsolution that is directly opposite to the surface tension. Upon reaching a critical \n\nvoltage, the electrostatic force generates localized charges that counterbalance with \n\nthe surface tension of the polymer solution at the spinneret tip, leading to droplet \n\nelongation and stretching until a conical shape known as the Taylor cone is formed, \n\nand a continuous jet is ejected. Initially, the polymer jet travels directly towards the \n\ngrounded collecting plate; however, it will deviate from the most direct path, resulting \n\nin a spiralling and further stretching, when the charge density (that increases with the \n\nincreasing distance from the spinneret) overcomes the surface tension. Finally, the \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\npolymer jet thins in air because of the elongation and the evaporation of the solvent, \n\nleading to the formation of electrospun fibres on the target [37,38,40].  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nElectrospinning can be performed using a wide range of polymers. In fact, \n\nseveral synthetic polymers like poly(lactic acid) (PLLA), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid, \n\npoly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) and Polyethylene glycol (PEG) have been successfully used \n\nto electrospin nanofibres for several tissue engineering applications. For instance, Shin \n\net al. [41] have construct a nanofibre-based PLGA scaffold with the potential of \n\nenhanced articular cartilage reconstruction. In another example, hBM-MSCs were able \n\nto produce cartilagineous extracellular matrix after being successfully cultured in PCL \n\nelectrospun nanofibres for cartilage tissue engineering purposes [42].      \n\nNatural polymers such as collagen or chitosan can also be electrospun; however \n\nthey are usually blended with synthetic polymers or salts in order to increase the \n\nsolution viscosity and consistency [38,40]. For example, Jeong et al. [43] have \n\nelectrospun composite alginate/ chitosan by adding PEO to the polymer solution. The \n\nauthors used the ability of this synthetic polymer to increase the polymer chain \n\nentanglements and decrease the conductivity of the charged polysaccharide solutions \n\nin order to aid the electrospinning process.  \n\nFigure 8. Schematic of the electrospinning process. Adapted from [40]. \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\nThe sizes of the electrospun fibres are typically between 200 nm and 5 mm, \n\ndepending on the conditions. In fact, fibre morphology can be easily controlled by \n\nadapting the parameters of the electrospinning process. These parameters can be \n\nclassified in system parameters, process parameters and ambient parameters [37,40].  \n\nThe system parameters are mainly associated with the solution properties such \n\nas viscosity/polymer concentration, conductivity, surface tension and polymer \n\nmolecular weight. Generally, increasing the viscosity of the solution by increasing \n\npolymer concentration leads to the formation of uniform fibres (without beads and \n\njunctions) with larger diameter. Variations in the conductivity by adding salt normally \n\nresult in small diameter fibres with fewer beads present. A decrease on beading can \n\nalso be accomplished with higher molecular weight polymers. The effects described \n\nabove can be very difficult to isolate due the inter-connected relationship between all \n\nthe polymer solution parameters. For example, it is very common that the conductivity \n\nvariations affect the viscosity of the polymer solution [37,44,45].           \n\nOn the other hand, the process parameters are related with the controlled \n\nvariables such as flow rate, electric field strength, distance between the spinneret and \n\nthe collector, needle tip design and collector composition and geometry. The effects \n\non the fibre morphology after an increase on the applied voltage are increased \n\nbeading and decreased diameter. On the other hand, increasing distance from the \n\ncollector can result in decreased fibre diameter and decreased fibre wetness due the \n\nlonger evaporation time of the solvent from the nanofibres. Contrary, when the flow \n\nrate increases, there are an increment in fibre wetness and bead formation [37,44,45].      \n\nThe ambient parameters like humidity and temperature are also important for \n\ntailoring the nanofibres. As the increasing of the temperature leads to a decrease of \n\nthe polymer viscosity, the electrospun fibres usually present a smaller diameter. The \n\nhumidity can affect the morphology of the fibre by the appearance of pores. Although \n\nthere are studies that corroborate these results, these parameters are poorly \n\nunderstood because their effects depend on the type of polymer, polymer-solvent \n\ncombination, molecular weight and polymer hydrophilicity [44,45].  \n\nOverall, electrospinning has been distinguished as an efficient and versatile \n\ntechnique for the fabrication of polymer micro or nanofibres. In fact, the electrospun \n\nscaffolds can be tailored in order to mimic the native extracellular matrix and \n\nconsequently support the attachment and proliferation of a large variety of cell types. \n\nRegardless, it can be a big challenge to engineer scaffolds with complex structures \n\nusing only the electrospinning approach.      \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\n1.3. Scaffold function \n\nThe term \u201cbioactive scaffold\u201d is currently applied in the tissue engineering field \n\nto describe a scaffold capable of not only supporting the cells physically and \n\nmechanically, but also enhancing cell adhesion, migration and proliferation as well as \n\nphenotype choice via biochemical agents. The goal of these scaffolds is to recreate the \n\nfunctions of the extracellular matrix in a temporally and spatially organized structure \n\n[1].  \n\nIn this way, the function of an optimal scaffold would be providing cell guidance \n\nand all aspects of cell response in a similar way as the ECM. Generally, the functions of \n\nthe ECM include providing structural support and mechanical properties for cells to \n\nreside, bioactive cues to enable cells to respond to various signals of their \n\nenvironment, a flexible physical environment to allow a quick and efficient remodelling \n\nin case of tissue dynamic process like wound healing and it also act as reservoir of \n\nbiomolecules and mediates their release. Currently, the scaffolds are able to closely \n\nmimic all this features due the physical and chemical characteristics of the materials \n\nused and also the microfabrication techniques selected. As explained above, \n\nelectrospinning can efficiently produce nanofibres with similar dimensions as the \n\ncollagen fibres from the natural extracellular matrix [46,47].  \n\nIn terms of bioactivity, scaffolds can be adapted to interact with the cellular \n\ncomponents and consequently facilitate and regulate their actions in a dynamic way. In \n\norder to accomplish that, the chemistry of the surface should not be only dependent \n\non the properties of the bulk material, but also on the incorporation of biological cues \n\nlike cell-adhesive ligands (e.g. fibronectin) to promote cell attachment [46]. For \n\nexample, the surface properties of the poly-acrylonitrile methyl acrylate (PAN-MA) \n\nelectrospun scaffold were improved by fibronectin adsorption, which proved to \n\ninfluence both the Schwann cells migration and the neurite outgrowth from dorsal \n\nroot ganglion culture [48]. The scaffolds could also be used as reservoirs or delivery \n\nstructures for biomolecules such as growth factors. Both hydrogels and electrospun \n\nfibres are very popular examples of this type of approach [1,46]. In fact, Holland et al. \n\n[49] have managed to create a oligo(poly(ethylene glycol)fumarate / gelatin \n\n(OPF/gelatin) hydrogel able to simultaneously deliver insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-\n\n1) and transforming growth factor-?1 (TGF- ?1) in a controlled manner to cartilage \n\ntissue engineering applications. Similarly, Wang et al. [50] have accomplished to \n\nrelease recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP-2) from an \n\nelectrospun scaffold for bone tissue engineering applications. Besides the biological \n\ncues, it is also important that the scaffold provides physical cues like topography to \n\nmodulate cell morphology and alignment [46]. In tissue engineering approaches, the \n\nincorporation of biological and mechanical cues on the surface of the scaffold usually \n\noccurs after application of some specific surface modification technique.     \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\n2. State of the Art \n\nThe combination of natural and synthetic polymers can optimize the physical \n\nand biological properties of the electrospun scaffolds, as well as mimic the morphology \n\nof the extra cellular matrix. However, in order to reach advanced biological and \n\ntherapeutic applications, the surface of the fibres should be able to immobilize some \n\nactive agents such as proteins and therapeutic genes without compromising the bulk \n\nproperties.  \n\nFor tissue engineering purposes, the role of the immobilized biomolecules on \n\nthe nanofibres surface should be comparable to the function of the biochemical cues \n\npresent in vivo during tissue regeneration, which is enhancing the specific phenotype \n\nand organization of the cells. According to this, several techniques of surface \n\nmodification such as plasma and radiation treatment are being used on the surface of \n\nthe electrospun scaffolds to directly enhance cell attachment and proliferation via \n\nprotein and peptides adsorption. A complementary approach can be followed in the \n\nevent of the adsorbed biomolecules are further released into the cell environment in a \n\ncontrollable and localized way to promote cell differentiation and proliferation.  \n\nIn addition to the tissue regeneration proposes, the nanofibre meshes could be \n\nalso used in drug delivery applications since the highly interconnected open nano-\n\nporous structure provides an extremely high surface area to volume ratio that results \n\nin a considerable drug loading amount per unit mass.  \n\nThe electrospinning modality can also influence the properties of the surface by \n\ninducing diversification on the performance of the scaffolds. Indeed, the \n\nelectrospinning technique can be adapted in order to control the composition of the \n\ncore-shell structure of the fibres or to modulate the surface patterning by topographic \n\ncues.     \n\nIn this way, it is important to understand which techniques are commonly used \n\non surface functionalization and what advantages each one brings into tissue \n\nenginnering applications (section 2.1). The biomolecule delivery approach will be \n\npresented in section 2.2 and the applications that come from different electrospinning \n\nmodalities will be explained in section 2.3.   \n\n2.1. Surface Modification of electrospun fibres \n\nThe main goal of the surface modification techniques is introduce functional \n\ngroups on the surface of the electrospun fibres able to immobilize secondary bioactive \n\nmolecules, guaranteeing at same time good biocompatibility levels and the \n\npreservation of the fibres morphology and their bulk properties [51,52].   \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\nGas plasma treatment is a common, suitable and versatile technique that is \n\nmainly employed to generate functional groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl and amino \n\ngroups on the polymer surface. Normally, it results in an increase of the surface \n\nwettability without changing the bulk properties of the material or causing \n\ndegradation; moreover, it can be used in complex shaped surfaces and it is a solvent \n\nfree technology [51,53].  \n\nPlasma is a high energy state of matter, in which an oxygen or nitrogen \n\ncontaining gas or an inert gas is partially ionized [51,53]. There are two major \n\ncategories of plasma: the thermal plasmas that cannot be used for biomedical \n\npolymers functionalization due to the high temperatures of the gas; and the non \n\nthermal plasmas that can be utilized in tissue engineering applications since the \n\ncombination of low gas temperature and high electron temperature is able to originate \n\nchemical and physical changes on the surface without causing any thermal damage \n\n[53]. \n\nFor tissue engineering applications the appropriate selection of the gas \n\n(oxygen, air or ammonia) used in the plasma treatment is a critical topic because it \n\ndecides the functional groups that will be introduced on the target surface and \n\nconsequently the specific biomolecules that can be covalently immobilized (e.g. \n\ncollagen, gelatin, laminin and fibronectin) [54,55]. Poly(L-lactic acid)-co-poly(?-\n\ncaprolactone) electrospun fibres treated with air plasma were able to immobilize \n\ncollagen on their surface and consequently improve the attachment, spreading and \n\nviability of the coronary artery endothelial cells [56]; in a similar example, Argon \n\nplasma treatment was used by Duan et al. [57] in order to build a collagen coated \n\npoly(?-caprolactone) electrospun scaffolds capable of enhancing the attachment, \n\nspreading and proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts. In other cases, electrospun \n\nPLLA nanofibres pre-treated with plasma were used to adsorb laminin [58] and \n\ncationized gelatin [59] for neural and cartilage tissue engineering applications, \n\nrespectively. \n\nThe wet chemical processes like hydrolysis and aminolysis are also suitable \n\napproaches to create new functionalities on the surface of biomedical polymers. The \n\nprocedure involves the reaction between the scaffold and liquid reagents under basic \n\nor acidic conditions to generate functional groups by random chemical scission of the \n\nester linkages on the backbone chain located on the surface. Indeed, the degraded and \n\nwater insoluble polymer fragments, that result from the wet chemical process, are \n\nable to generate carboxylic, hydroxyl and amino groups [51,53,54]. Although this \n\nprocess is relatively simple since it does not require specialized equipment, the results \n\nare often non specific and non reproducible [53]. So, the duration of the hydrolysis and \n\nthe concentration of the hydrolysing agents are essential to optimally produce \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\nfunctional groups without altering significantly the bulk properties of the scaffold \n\n[51,54].   \n\nThe applications of the wet chemical process concerning electrospun fibres are \n\nmostly related with bone tissue engineering applications. One example was developed \n\nby Jim et al. [60] who were able to create a suitable environment for the proliferation \n\nand function of osteoblasts using an electrospun poly(?-caprolactone) (PCL) fibrous \n\nscaffold treated by a controlled hydrolysis in a NaOH medium.   \n\nThe use of radiation is another method used in tissue engineering applications \n\nto modify biomedical polymer surfaces. The most common category of irradiation \n\ntechnique uses ultraviolet light (UV); however there are other types of radiation able \n\nto introduce chemical groups on scaffolds\u2019 surfaces such as gamma radiation, ozone \n\ntreatment and ozone combined with UV irradiation. The goal of the radiation approach \n\nis to generate reactive areas that can become functional groups or can be used to \n\ninitiate grafting of monomers or graft polymerization. In fact, radiation is a simple and \n\nclean surface modification method since it does not require chemical additives or \n\ncatalysts, though the dependence on the energy source can lead to nonspecific and \n\nnon permanent degradation of the polymer backbone  [51,53].  \n\nThe surface modification via UV irradiation is commonly used in tissue \n\nengineering applications due its direct effect on protein adsorption and consequently \n\non the cell adhesion process [61]. For example, Welle et al. [62] were able to modify \n\nthe surface of electrospun Poly(propyl carbonate) (PPC) fibres via deep UV irradiation \n\nin order to increase the adsorption of proteins that stimulate cell adhesion. The study \n\nshowed positive results with both L929 fibroblasts and primary rat hepatocytes cell \n\nlines. The UV irradiation can be also used to photo-reduce the Ag\n+\n ions within cellulose \n\nacetate (CA) nanofibres to build antimicrobial separation filters [63]. Basically, the CA \n\nnanofibres electrospun from a combined CA / AgNO3 solution were irradiated with UV \n\nlight with the purpose of producing Ag nanoparticles on their surface.   \n\nThe relevance of the graft polymerization induced by UV irradiation in the \n\nconstruction of advanced and specific electrospun scaffolds was discussed by Chua et \n\nal. in several reports. In one example, the polyethersulfone (PES) electrospun \n\nnanofibre scaffold was firstly carboxylated by UV-initiate poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc) \n\ngrafting and then functionalized with amino groups to facilitate the adhesion and \n\nexpression of umbilical cord blood hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) [64]. \n\nIn another approach followed by the same author [65], a nanofibre scaffold \n\nfunctionalized with galactose was used to study the attachment, the phenotype and \n\nthe functional maintenance of rat hepatocytes. This strategy is summarized in the \n\nFigure 9: initially the Poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc) was grafted onto the surface of the \n\nelectrospun poly(e-caprolactone-co-ethyl ethylene phosphate) (PCLEEP) scaffold via \n\nUV irradiation; then, the surface carboxyl (COOH) groups were covalently conjugated \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\nwith 1-O-(60-aminohexyl)-D-galactopyranoside (AHG) via N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide \n\n(sulfo-NHS) / 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) complex in order \n\nto allow cells attachment through galactose -  asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) \n\ninteractions.    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Besides the UV irradiation treatment, there are other valid options like gamma \n\nirradiation that can be used on surface modification procedures. For instance, it can be \n\nused to graft Acrylic acid (AAc) on Poly(L-lactic co-poly-?-caprolactone) (PLCL) for \n\nfurther immobilization of gelatin; this strategy was applied in a study of the adhesion, \n\nspreading and proliferation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) by Shin et al. \n\n[66]. Using a similar electrospun scaffold, but utilizing photo-grafting Arg-Gly-Asp \n\n(RGD) containing peptide instead of gelatin, it was possible study the adhesion and \n\nproliferation of the MC3T3-E1 pre-osteblastic cells [67]. \n\n2.2. Electrospun fibres for the delivery of \n\nbioactive molecules \n\nThe surface of the electrospun scaffolds can be chemically functionalized with \n\nthe purpose of achieving sustained delivery of bioactive molecules. This means that \n\ninstead of having proteins immobilized on the surface to enhance cell adhesion, the \n\nscaffolds should ensure the bioactivity of the incorporated biomolecules and fit their \n\nrelease profile within the adequate time frame [1]. The signalling molecules used \n\ndepend on the function of the scaffold: cell division can be stimulated by mitogens; the \n\nFigure 9. Surface modification scheme for galactose conjugation to PCLEEP electrospun nanofiber scaffold \nAdapted from [65].  \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\nmigration, proliferation and differentiation can be accomplished by the release of \n\nproteins such as growth factors and the control generation of tissue form can be due \n\nto the morphogens action [68].          \n\nAlthough growth factor delivery scaffolds are usually fabricated using hydrogels \n\ndue their defined three-dimensional polymer networks that allows easy incorporation \n\nof proteins, their limitations like poor mechanical properties, cell death in the depths \n\nof the scaffold and the impossibility of having a controlled release over a long time \n\nperiod [69,70] have turned electropun fibres into a viable alternative for protein \n\ndelivery approaches. Indeed, the electrospun scaffolds can easily act as a drug carrier \n\nsince their structural characteristics allow good dissolution rate, relative ease of drug \n\nincorporation and limited time for dug crystallization [71]. \n\nBesides the protein release issue, electrospun scaffolds could also be adapted \n\nfor gene delivery. The differences between the scaffolds are related with the \n\nparticularities of both delivery systems:  contrary to the growth factors, which act \n\nextracellularly by binding to cell surface receptors, target genes must enter into the \n\nhost genome of endogenous cells, transforming them into bio-activated actors able to \n\nproduce therapeutic proteins. So, the target genes are usually packed within vectors \n\n(viral and non-viral) before incorporation into the scaffold in order to protect the \n\ngenes from degradation [1].      \n\nPhysical surface adsorption is a simple approach to load biomolecules into \n\nelectrospun scaffolds. Basically, the fibres are dipped into an aqueous phase (solution \n\nor emulsion) containing biomolecules, which consequently attach to the scaffold via \n\nelectrostatic forces. For example, BMP-2 was released by a poly(D,L-lactide-co-\n\nglycolide)/hydroxyl-lapatite (PLGA/HAp) electrospun scaffold to enhance bone \n\nregeneration after being successfully adsorbed by the fibres [72]. The PLGA/Hap \n\nelectrospun scaffold also proved to be very promising as a DNA delivery device since it \n\nwas also tested for encapsulation of BMP-2 plasmid DNA/chitosan nanoparticles. The \n\nDNA/chitosan nanoparticles released from the PLGA/Hap fibres proven to have a \n\nremarkable intracellular effect in the human marrow stem cells (hMSCs) by improving \n\ntheir attachment, viability and transfection efficiency of DNA [73].  \n\nIn another method named blend electrospinning, biomolecules are mixed \n\nwithin the polymer solution in order to electrospin a hybrid scaffold. As this strategy \n\nlocalizes the biomolecules (e.g. proteins) within the fibres of the scaffolds, it allows \n\nmore sustained release profiles compared to physical adsorption [1,51]. The common \n\nprotein release from blend electrospun scaffolds is divided in two periods: during the \n\nfirst 24 hours a burst release occurs due a certain fraction of proteins that are located \n\non the surface of the scaffold; after this period, a sustained release close to a linear \n\nmode is observed because of either the protein diffusion process or the polymer \n\ndegradation process combined with protein diffusion. So, different polymers with \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\nspecific properties will originate unique release behaviours [1]. Besides the release \n\nprofile, the preservation of the biological activity of the biomolecules is a very \n\nimportant prerequisite in designing electrospun scaffolds with the purpose of delivery \n\n[51]. For example, basic fibroblast growth factors were introduced into PLGA fibres and \n\ntheir release favoured bone marrow stem cell attachment, proliferation and \n\ndifferentiation [70]. Blend electrospinning was also used to build a PEO/ Bovine serum \n\nalbumin (BSA) scaffold [74] and a PLLA / laminin electrospun scaffold capable of \n\nenhance PC12 cell viability and neurite outgrowth [58].     \n\n2.3. Fabrication of electrospun fibres with the \n\ndefined structure \n\nThe function of the electrospun scaffolds can be modulated through the use of \n\nseveral innovative electrospinning techniques that permit the fabrication of multi-\n\nlayered electrospun fibres and the control of topographic cues.    \n\nThe core-shell structure is a very useful nanofibre scaffold shape because this \n\nstructure is capable of containing bioactive agents such as proteins, drugs and \n\nenzymes within the core and consequently control their release kinetics. The \n\nelectrospinning modality used to fabricate this kind of scaffold is called coaxial \n\nelectrospinning, in which both polymer solution and biological solution are coaxial and \n\nsimultaneously electrospun without direct mixing by using two aligned syringes (Figure \n\n10). As explained in the section 1.2.1, during coaxial electrospinning, it is necessary to \n\napply appropriate parameters in order to fabricate a suitable electrospun scaffold. \n\nTherefore, several factors like feeding rate of the inner and outer fluids, interfacial \n\ntension and viscoelasticity of the two solutions can influence the process output by \n\naffecting the entrapment of components in the core part and the dimensions of both \n\ninner and outer diameters [1,51].    \n\n Coaxial electrospinning was recently used for both tissue engineering and drug \n\ndelivery applications since the release profile includes an initial burst released followed \n\nby a sustained release period, which is analogous to the one from blend electrospun \n\nscaffolds presented in the previous section. However, the initial burst release from the \n\ncoaxial electrospun fibres is inferior in volume and consequently more prolonged \n\nbecause of the core characteristics that work as a reservoir system with a \n\nbiodegradable polymer barrier able to control the biomolecules diffusion rate [1,51]. \n\nFor example, Sahoo et al. [70] have showed that PLGA coaxial nanofibres are capable \n\nof sustaining the release of bFGF from its core for two weeks, a much longer period \n\nthan the release profile of basic fibroblast growth factors incorporated in a PLGA / \n\nbFGF blend scaffold. The release kinetics of proteins from coaxial electrospun scaffolds \n\nwas thoroughly studied by Zhang et al. [75] that have encapsulated fluorescent-labeled \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\nBSA protein along with PEG in PCL nanofibres with variable dimensions. The report \n\nindicated that the release rate is fibre size dependent, which means that smaller-sized \n\nfibres have a faster release then the larger ones. These results were able to provide \n\nbasis for further design and optimization of protein delivery from coaxial electrospun \n\nfibres for several tissue engineering applications. For instance, the coaxial electrospun \n\nmethodology was successfully applied in the building of a composite poly(lactic acid-\n\ncaprolactone) / nerve growth factor (P(LLA-CL)/NGF)  nerve conduit able to promote \n\nsciatic nerve regeneration in rats [76].  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Besides the chemical rearrangement of the electrospun fibres, the physical \n\norganization and orientation of the fibres also play important roles during the design \n\nof the scaffold. This is because the scaffolds should replicate the natural structure of \n\nthe extracellular matrix, which contains components that are arranged into extremely \n\norganized structures to control cell responses [51]. \n\n For tissue regeneration applications, the alignment of the fibres can be a critical \n\nfeature since the cells cultured on such scaffolds are able to recognize the geometry \n\nand then align themselves along the fibres [51]. There are two major methods that can \n\nbe used to accomplish aligned electrospun fibres: high speed rotating drum collector \n\nand stationary gap collector.  \n\nThe use of the rotating drum collector is a simple and mechanical method of \n\naligning the fibres along the circumference of the cylindrical drum. Basically, the \n\ncollector (grounded or negatively charged) rotates at a high surface speed (over 1500 \n\nrpm) to make the electrospun fibres align along the rotating axis. Although it generates \n\nFigure 10. Coaxial electrospinning process. Adapted from [51].  \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nfibres with good alignment, this technique does not offer control over the fibre \n\nplacement or a high degree of alignment since the deposited fibres accumulate \n\nresidual charge that will consequently interfere with the incoming ones [77,78,79].   \n\nOn the other hand, by using the gap method, the alignment of the electrospun \n\nfibres is achieved through the manipulation of the electric field. The manipulation is \n\nprovoked by two parallel conductive electrodes spaced apart that direct the \n\nelectrospinning jet across the gap as the electric field lines are attracted towards the \n\nelectrodes. In addition to this, the presence of charges on the deposited fibres will \n\noriginate mutual repulsion and consequently enhance the parallel and even \n\ndistribution of the fibres. The main disadvantage of the gap method is the limitation in \n\nfibre placement, since the alignment only occurs between the two electrodes; in fact, \n\nif the distance that separates the electrodes is too big, the fibres will be deposited on \n\nthe top of the electrodes and not across the gap [77,78,79].               \n\nAccording to literature, the alignment of the electrospun fibres is particular \n\nrelevant to the regeneration of skeletal muscle, ligaments, nerve and blood vessels. \n\nFor example, Aviss et al.[80] have created a PLGA aligned electrospun scaffold able to \n\nprovide contact guidance for C2C12 myoblast adhesion, elongation and differentiation. \n\nIn a similar way, a PLLA aligned electrospun scaffold was able to provide better \n\nguidance and growth for both neurite and ganglia than random PLLA fibres [81]. A \n\nstudy developed by Xu et al. [82] has described a favourable interaction between an \n\naligned poly(l-lactid-co-e-caprolactone) [P(LLA-CL)] with human coronary artery \n\nsmooth muscle cells (SMCs). The results showed that the SMCs cultured on the aligned \n\nscaffolds had better adhesion and proliferation rate than the ones cultured on plane \n\npolymer films; in addition to this, the fibres alignment has influenced the cell migration \n\nand the orientation of the cytoskeleton proteins inside the cells, which were parallel to \n\nthe direction of the nanofibre.   \n\nFibre diameter is other topographic feature of the electrospun fibres that can \n\nhighly influence certain behaviors of cells such as adhesion, spreading, migration, \n\nproliferation and differentiation [51,83]. The investigation developed by Chen et al. \n\n[84] showed that the diameter of the PCL fibres affects the adhesion and proliferation \n\nof the NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line. Indeed, the cell adhesion and growth kinetics \n\ndecreased as a function of increasing diameter when the average fibre diameter was in \n\nthe nano range; on the other hand, when the fibre diameter was in the micro range, \n\ncell adhesion and kinetics showed no variation. These cell behaviors can be either due \n\nto the larger surface area-to-volume ratio in the scaffolds with a smaller fibre \n\ndiameter, which leads consequently to a more efficient growth factors adsorption; or it \n\ncan be because the cells need less force to migrate within and over the fibres with \n\nsmaller diameter than the fibres which present a larger diameter.          \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\n3. Aim \n\nPolyActive is a well known FDA approved copolymer with adaptable surface \n\nenergy and mechanical properties. Thus, it is commonly used as a biomaterial to create \n\ncomplex scaffolds for several tissue engineering applications and the upgrade of its \n\nabilities to mimic the natural extracellular matrix can be accomplished via the \n\nelectrospinning process.  \n\nIn this way, the overall motivation of this project was to develop bioactive \n\nfibrous scaffolds able to provide selective guidance for cells via topographic and \n\nbiochemical cues. The topographic cues were accomplished by using the gap method \n\nin a controlled environment, allowing the alignment and a controlled deposition of the \n\nfibres. For biochemical cues, two distinct surface modification techniques were \n\ninvestigated with the purpose of ensure the immobilization of specific biomolecules.  \n\nIn one approach, the influence of the UV irradiation in the appearance of new \n\nfunctional groups on the surface of both PA 300 and PA 1000 was studied. The purpose \n\nof this strategy was to induce the modification of the fibre surface chemistry with a \n\nspatially defined UV exposure, and consequently adjust the degree of biomolecule \n\nadsorption. \n\nIn the second strategy, two different blend solution of PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA \n\nand PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne were electrospun with the intention of incorporate \n\nchemical groups on the surface of the fibres, respectively NHS-esters and alkynes, for \n\nfurther functionalization. The concept behind this innovative approach is that \n\ndepending on the selected PEG linker, it will be possible to induce adsorption of \n\ndifferent biomolecules without the need of a previous surface treatment (e.g. plasma \n\nor UV). In fact the success of this strategy can open the door for more simple and \n\noriginal methodologies to develop functionalized electrospun scaffolds.      \n\n \n\n           \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\n4.

All these solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Before use, the solution \n\nwas left to stir for a minimum period of 12 hours at room temperature. Then, a syringe \n\ncontaining the described solution was pumped at a controlled flow rate (1ml/hour) \n\nusing a syringe pump (KDS 100, KD Scientific). Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing \n\nwas used to connect the syringe tip (diameter = 0.8 mm) and the electrospinning \n\nnozzle to which a high voltage was applied (Gamma High Voltage Research Inc., FL, \n\nUSA). The electrospun fibres were aligned on a glass coverslip (diameter = 14 mm) due \n\nthe presence of two parallel electrodes that were able to modulate the electric field. \n\nThe electrodes were aligned to the centre of the coverslip and spaced 1 cm from it.     \n\nThe PA 300 scaffolds were electrospun with a working distance (distance from \n\nthe collector to the spinneret) of 20 cm and a voltage of 20 kV during 1 minute. The \n\ntemperature during the spinning was 25?C and the humidity varied between 30% and \n\n35%.  \n\n4.1.2. PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA \n\nThe PA 300 and the (bis)PEG-SVA (SVA-PEG-SVA, MW 5 000, Laysan Bio Inc.) \n\npolymers were mixed together with a proportion of 4:1 in a 15% (w/v) solution. The \n\nsolvents used were chloroform (CHCl3) and 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) \n\nwith an 80/20 % v/v.  \n\nThe PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA scaffolds were electrospun with a working distance \n\nof 25 cm and a voltage of 25 kV during 1 minute. The temperature during the spinning \n\nwas 25?C and the humidity varied between 30% and 35%. The electrospinning set up \n\nwas similar to the one described in the previous section (4.1.1.).    \n\n \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\n4.1.3. PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne \n\nThe PA 300 and the (bis)PEG-Alkyne (Alkyne-PEG-Alkyne, MW 5 000, Laysan Bio \n\nInc.) polymers were mixed together with a proportion of 4:1 in a 15% (w/v) solution. \n\nThe solvents used were chloroform (CHCl3) and 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3-hexafluoro-2-propanol \n\n(HFIP) with an 80/20 % v/v.  \n\nThe PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne scaffolds were electrospun with a working \n\ndistance of 25 cm and a voltage of 25 kV during 1 minute. The temperature during the \n\nspinning was 25?C and the humidity varied between 30% and 35%. The electrospinning \n\nset up was similar to the one described in the section 4.1.1.   \n\n4.1.4. PA 1000 \n\nThe PA 1000 solution (15% (w/v)) was prepared in a mixture of chloroform \n\n(CHCl3) and 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) with an 80/20 % v/v. The \n\nsolution was electrospun in the same set up described before (section 4.1.1.), with a \n\nworking distance of 25 cm and a voltage of 25 kV during 1 minute. The temperature \n\nduring the spinning was 25?C and the humidity varied between 30% and 35%.   \n\n4.2. UV treatment \n\nPA 300 and PA 1000 electrospun scaffolds were treated with UV irradiation \n\nusing an UV Crosslinker (UltraLum, model CEX-800) with a wavelength of 254 nm and \n\nenergy of 1200 mJ. The samples were positioned at a 20 cm from the UV source and \n\nthe treatment was performed for 5, 10, 20, 40, 90 or 180 minutes.   \n\nAn auxiliary pattern on the fibrous scaffold surface was produced by a nickel \n\nmask with outer dimensions of 2.5 cm X 2.5 cm. The mask was placed on the surface of \n\nthe scaffold before UV exposure in order to selectively activate specific areas. Indeed, \n\nthe irradiation only interacts with the surface through 140 rectangles (1.9 cm of high \n\nand 21.05 ?m of width) spaced by 103.76 ?m.        \n\n4.3. Analysis techniques \n4.3.1. NMR \n\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a technique based on the \n\nmagnetic nuclear spin of isotopes (e.g. \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC) and it is commonly used to identify \n\nand analyze organic compounds. Basically, the sample is placed in a magnetic field and \n\nsubjected to a radiofrequency radiation, which, depending on the frequency used, can \n\nbe absorbed by the nuclei of the sample. This energy absorption promotes a transition \n\nbetween nuclear energy levels (spin flip) and it is highly influenced by the local \n\nelectronic environment surrounding the nucleus, which can shield the nucleus from \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\nthe externally applied magnetic field (nuclear shielding) and therefore modify the \n\ndifference between the energy levels. These differences in the electron distribution \n\ncan be due the differences in bond lengths and angles, bonding different atoms or \n\nbond types, and they are relative to a standard reference: tetramethylsilane. The \n\nassociation between the resonance frequency of a nucleus and the standard signal is \n\ncalled chemical shift and it is measured in parts per million (ppm). The chemical shifts \n\nallow you to indentify different chemical environments that can be determined by \n\nFourier transforming the NMR signal. The resultant spectrum shows the different \n\nchemical environments (x-axis is given in ppm) associated with a peak, which area is \n\ndirectly proportional to the number of nuclei in that chemical environment \n\n[85,86,87,88].       \n\nThe \n1\nH NMR  spectra (Bruker Avance 400 MHz) of the PA 1000 and PA 300 \n\nelectrospun scaffolds (chapter 5) as well as the (bis)PEG-SVA and (bis)PEG-Alkyne \n\n(chapter 6)  were recorded using solutions of the indicated polymers in d-chloroform \n\npurchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The analysis of the spectra was based on the chemical \n\nshifts tables from the Handbook of Basic Tables for Chemical Analysis [89].    \n\n4.3.2. ATR-FTIR \n\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a spectroscopy technique \n\nbased on the interaction between the infrared radiation (IR) with a material, in which \n\nits molecular vibrations are analyzed. These vibrations are provoked by restricted \n\nradiation absorption since each molecule only absorbs the radiation at frequencies \n\nthat match its unique fundamental modes of vibration. The peaks of the FTIR spectra \n\nare associated to the frequencies which radiation is absorbed and consequently to the \n\nspecific chemical bonds and chemical functional groups present on the material [90]. \n\nBesides the identification of the functional groups, it is also possible to do a \n\nquantitatively analysis of the sample since the area of one IR peak is an indicator of the \n\nspecific molecules concentration [91].     \n\nAs the main goal of the project is to functionalize the surfaces of electrospun \n\nscaffolds, a modality of FTIR was selected which is commonly used in surface or near-\n\nsurface composition characterization: Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform \n\nInfrared (ATR-FTIR). For analysis, the ATR-FTIR process involves a close contact \n\nbetween an internal reflection element (e.g. zinc selenide or germanium crystals) with \n\nthe sample. As this crystal has a high refractive index, the IR beam is reflected \n\ninternally and consequently creates an evanescence wave that penetrates in the \n\nimmediate environment above the crystal. As a result of that, the sample absorbs \n\nsome energy from the evanescent wave that becomes a signal that later gets \n\nconverted by Fourier transform to a defined spectrum [90,92]. The main advantage of \n\nthis technique is that it does not require sample preparation, so the PA 1000 and PA \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\n300 (chapter 5) as well as the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA and PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne \n\nfibrous scaffolds (chapter 6) were analyzed immediately after the electrospinning \n\nprocess. The spectra were recorded (Bruker ALPHA FT-IR Spectrometer) at a resolution \n\nof 4 cm\n-1\n\n and average of 64 scans.      \n\nThe qualitative analysis of the ATR-FTIR spectra (chapters 5 and 6) was made by \n\nusing the tables from the Handbook of Basic Tables for Chemical Analysis [89]. \n\nRelatively to the quantitative analysis, the areas underneath the peaks were calculated \n\nusing Microsoft Excel (Microsoft. Microsoft Excel. Redmond, Washington: Microsoft, \n\n2007. Computer Software.) by the trapezoidal rule [93]. In the chapter 5, the chemical \n\nchanges due the UV irradiation were calculated relatively to the peak areas from the \n\nuntreated scaffolds.   \n\n4.3.3. XPS \n\nX-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) is a highly surface specific technique \n\nable to provide qualitative and quantitative information on the atomic composition of \n\na solid\u2019s outer surface down to a depth of typically between 0.5 and 10 nm. It is a \n\ntechnique based on a photo-electronic effect: the sample is exposed to X-ray with the \n\npurpose of exciting the core-level electrons from the specific type of atoms/ions \n\npresent on the surface. The energy of the emitted photoelectrons, which is specific for \n\neach element, is then analyzed by the electron spectrometer and the data displayed as \n\na spectra of intensity versus electron energy. Besides elemental composition, the \n\nphotoelectron peaks can also provide useful information about the quantification of \n\nthe surface composition by calculating their areas [90,92].   \n\nXPS was performed by Gerard Kip to determine the chemical composition of \n\nthe scaffolds (Chapters 5 and 6) and also to calculate any change in the chemical \n\ncomposition due either UV irradiation (chapter 5) or addition of functionalized PEG \n\nlinkers (chapter 6). The process was carried out on a Quantera SXM (scanning XPS \n\nmicroprobe, Ie 2.6 mA, power 24.8 W, working pressure ?2e-8 Torr, Physical \n\nElectronics). The measurements were carried out on electrospun scaffolds either after \n\nUV treatment (chapter 5) or after the electrospinning process (chapter 6), on four \n\npoints per sample with monochromatic Al-K? radiation at 1486.6 eV. The main peak of \n\nC1s peak was set at 284.8 eV and Multipak v.9.0.0 was used for data reduction. \n\n4.4. Protein adsorption tests \n\nAlbumin-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate from bovine (FITC-BSA, Sigma \n\nAldrich) was used as model protein to evaluate the adsorption on UV treated and \n\nuntreated surfaces of both PA 1000 and PA 300 electrospun scaffolds (chapter 5). FITC-\n\nBSA was also used to test the adsorption properties of the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA \n\nscaffold (section 6.1.). The scaffolds were incubated in a FITC-BSA / phosphate \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\nbuffered saline (PBS) (10 ?g / 1 ml) solution at room temperature during 2 hours. After \n\nthe incubation period, the samples were washed with PBS to remove any non-\n\nadherent proteins. The further analysis was carried out via fluorescent microscope \n\nobservations in a Fluorescence/Histology microscope (NIKON ECLIPSE E600).  \n\nSome scaffolds were tested with the complex 1-Ethyl-3-(3-\n\ndimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide / N-Hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS). Scaffolds were \n\nimmersed in a NHS/EDC (200mM/100mM) PBS solution for 1h at room temperature \n\nbefore the incubation in a FITC-BSA / PBS solution. The EDC and the NHS were \n\npurchased from Sigma-Aldrich.  \n\n4.5. Click Chemistry tests \n\nThe click chemistry reaction between the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne electrospun \n\nscaffold and a model Azide (Azide MegaStokes dye 673, Sigma-Aldrich) was \n\ninvestigated in order to simulate the ability of the scaffold\u2019s surface to adsorb azide \n\nmodified biomolecules. The scaffolds were incubated in an Azide / phosphate buffered \n\nsaline (PBS) (10 ?g / 1 ml) solution at room temperature during 2 hours. After the \n\nincubation period, the samples were washed with PBS to remove any non-adherent \n\nazide biomolecules. The further analysis was carried out via fluorescent microscope \n\nobservations in a Microscope Fluorescence Nikon.  \n\n4.6. Cell culture \n\nThe in vitro experiments were performed with rat Schwann cells. Before the cell \n\nculture experiments, the electropun scaffolds (PA 300 and PA 1000 untreated and \n\ntreated with UV) were placed on a non-treated well plate (NUNC) and soaked in 70% \n\nethanol for 30 minutes in order to sterilize them. Then, the scaffolds were rinsed with \n\nPBS and incubated at 37 ?C in a humid atmosphere with 5% CO2 for 4h in a cell culture \n\nmedium (Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Meidium (DMEM) + 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) \n\n+ 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (pen-strep)) to allow protein adhesion from the medium. \n\nTo ensure that the electrospun scaffolds would stay in place, rubber O-rings (Eriks BV, \n\nThe Netherlands) were used to secure them.  \n\n15 000 cells (in 200 ?l culture medium) were seeded on to each scaffold after \n\nremoving the medium used for incubation. It was added more culture medium to a \n\nvolume of 2 ml per well and the scaffolds were incubated for 12h. After the incubation \n\nperiod, the scaffolds were rinsed with PBS and fixed in 10% formalin for 20 min, upon \n\nremoval of the medium. After that, the membranes of the cells were permeabilized in \n\na 0.5% triton-X solution for 10 min between PBS washing steps. Then, to reduce the \n\nnonspecific background staining, the fixed cells were incubated in a PBS solution \n\ncontaining 1% of BSA for 25 minutes. Finally, the actin filaments of the cells were \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\nstained with phalloidin (Sigma-Aldrich) and their nuclei were stained with DAPI (Sigma-\n\nAldrich) for further fluorescent microscope observations in a fluorescence microscope \n\n(NIKON ECLIPSE E600).       \n\n          \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n46 \n \n\n5. Functionalization of PolyActive \n\nelectrospun fibres by UV exposure \n\nThe structural and functional properties of the surfaces of both PA 1000 and  \n\nPA 300 electrospun scaffolds were modified via UV irradiation in order to improve \n\nprotein adsorption and consequently to enhance cell adhesion.  \n\nThe chemical changes induced by UV irradiation proved to be dependent on the \n\nPEOT/PBT wt % and on the molecular weight of PEG. Indeed, after 40 minutes of UV \n\nexposure, the PA 1000 electrospun fibres showed a high content of carboxyl and \n\nhydroxyl groups on their surface. On the other hand, the higher weight percentage of \n\nPBT on the PA 300 fibres provoked the generation of benzoquinones on their surface \n\nafter 40 minutes of UV treatment. The chemical characterization of the electrospun \n\nscaffolds was made via NMR and the analysis of the untreated and treated surfaces \n\nwas performed by ATR-FTIR and XPS techniques.   \n\n The FITC-BSA was used as model protein to evaluate the protein adsorption on \n\nuntreated and surface treated scaffolds, which showed a considerable enhance in \n\nprotein immobilization comparing with the UV non-treated surfaces. In terms of cell \n\nresponse, the Rat Schwann Cells successfully attached to both untreated and treated \n\nsurfaces of PA 1000 and PA 300 scaffolds. However, the larger number of cells \n\nattached on the UV treated surfaces indicated the presence of a superior quantity of \n\nfunctional groups able to immobilize adhesion proteins from the culture medium. It \n\nwas also noticed that the specific chemical composition of PA 300 and PA 1000 \n\ninduced morphological differences in the cells. A spatially defined surface \n\nfunctionalization was also accomplished in both scaffolds by the use of a UV mask that \n\nallowed a preferential protein adsorption on the activated areas. As a consequence of \n\nthe spatial definition of protein adsorption, the cell attachment occurred mostly on the \n\nsites of the electrospun scaffolds that were exposed to UV irradiation.        \n\n5.1. Scaffolds characterization \n\nThe ATR-FTIR spectrum of PA 1000 samples displayed approximately the same \n\ncharacteristic bands as PA 300 (Figure 11); these results are not surprising since the \n\nonly differences between the two polymers are the percentages of the PEOT and PBT \n\nsegments as well as the initial PEG molecular weight.      \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n The FTIR spectrum of PA 1000 fibres shows a more intense absorbance in the C-\n\nH stretch region (2840 \u2013 3000 cm\n-1\n\n) than the PA 300. This is due the higher PEO \n\ncontent and the longer chains present in the PA 1000. On the other hand, the PA 300 \n\nconfirms the tendency to be more crystalline then PA 1000 because of the higher \n\nabsorbance in the aromatic C-H out of plane bending region (715 \u2013 735 cm\n-1\n\n).  \n\n In both cases there are bands at 1102 cm\n-1\n\n, 1270 cm\n-1\n\n and 1714 cm\n-1\n\n, that are \n\nrelated with the C-O-C stretch of the ether and with the C-O and C=O stretches of the \n\nester, respectively.  \n\n The comparison between the \n1\nH-NMR spectra of the two polymers showed a \n\nsimilar chemical composition, only with slightly differences because of the dissimilarity \n\nin the PEOT/PBT contents. In fact, the higher hydrophilicity of the PA 1000 fibres \n\ncompared to the PA 300 is illustrated in the Figure 12 as well as the differences in the \n\nPBT content. These two features are showed by the peaks at 1.56 ppm (higher in the \n\nPA 1000 spectrum) and 8.15 ppm (higher in the PA 300 spectrum), which are related to \n\nthe water content in the sample (impurity) and with the hydrogen linked to the \n\naromatic ring respectively.      \n\nThe other peaks present in both spectra are associated with the CH2 located on \n\nthe PEO backbone chain (3.70 ppm), the connection between the ethylene oxide \n\nresidues connected to the terephthalate unit (3.90 ppm) and with the CH2 positioned \n\nin the butanediol component of the PBT (2.00 and 4.45 ppm). The \n1\nH-NMR results \n\nreported here corroborate the results accomplished by Deschamps et al. [18].      \n\nOne of the reasons why the peaks 2, 3, 4 and 5 are smaller in the PA 1000 \n\nspectrum could be because of the hydrolysis process induced by the high water \n\ncontent in this scaffold. The water molecules presented in the PA 1000 fibres could \n\nhave been absorbed from the atmosphere during the electrospinning process due the \n\nhydrophilicity properties of this polymer.        \n\nFigure 11. ATR-FTIR spectra of PA 1000 (blue) and PA 300 (red).  \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe effect of the UV treatment on the surface of the PA 1000 and PA 300 fibres \n\nis resumed in the figures 10 and 11, that describe the time evolution of the surfaces \n\nchemistry composition during UV exposure. The changes are result of the degradation \n\nprocesses (both hydrolysis and oxidation) that provoke the rearrangement of the \n\nmolecular structure and the formation of a new region between 3100 and 3700 cm\n-1\n\n. \n\nThis new region is related to the O-H stretch and it indicates the formation of the new \n\nproducts that are originated during the several stages of the oxidation process (Figure \n\n13).   \n\nThe UV irradiation of the PA 1000 fibres leads to important modifications in the \n\nFTIR spectrum. In fact, during the first 10 minutes of exposure there is an increase in \n\nthe absorbance bands of the C=O, C-O and C-O-C stretches and at the 715 \u2013 735 cm\n-1\n\n \n\nregion, which is due to the aromatic C-H out of plane bends. At the same time, a \n\ndecrease in the C-H stretch peak and the O-H stretch region is noted. This data can be \n\nassociated to the consumption of OH and H of the polymer chain for the production of \n\nboth esters and formates (see Figure 4). The increasing in the 715 \u2013 735 cm\n-1\n\n region is \n\nnot related to the aromatic part, but instead to the C-H rocking of the oxidation \n\nproducts.   \n\nAfter this initial irradiation period, the increase of temperature in the system \n\nleads to the formation of the alcohols and the degradation of the PBT starts. Indeed, as \n\nthe photo-oxidation starts in the amorphous phase because of the easy oxygen \n\ndiffusion [23], it is plausible that the formation of mono and di-hydroxy-substituted \n\ncompounds starts later then the formate and ester production. The decrease in the \n\nother absorbance bands is because of scission chain events originated by both \n\noxidation and hydrolysis (H2O is also formed during the formates production); The \n\nFigure 13 also shows the rise of a shoulder at 1185 cm\n-1\n\n (C-C-O stretch), which is \n\nrelated to the continuous production of formates [23].         \n\nFigure 12. H-NMR spectra of PA 1000 (A) and PA 300 (B). Legend: 1- Aromatic; 2- Butylene (CH2); 3 \u2013 PEO (CH2);          \n4 \u2013 PEO backbone chain (CH2); 5 \u2013 Butylene (CH2); 6 \u2013 Water. The solvent peak for CDCl3 is located at 7.25 ppm. \n\n\n\n49 \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA similar analysis can be made for the PA 300 scaffold, and as expected the high \n\nPBT content in the fibres has a critical influence in the polymer degradation. Like it was \n\nillustrated in the PA 1000, the formation of esters and formates occurs in the first 10 \n\nminutes of UV irradiation with an increase in the C-O-C, C-O and C=O stretches and in \n\nthe C-H rocking absorbance region. The Figure 14 also shows the decrease in the C-H \n\nstretch of the backbone chain related to the hydrogen abstraction reactions involved \n\nin the PEO segment photo-oxidation. Subsequent to this initial period, comes the \n\ndecrease of these absorbance bands because of chain scission events. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n The degradation of the PBT segment is mainly related with the changes in the \n\nO-H peak during UV exposure and with the decrease in the 715 \u2013 735 cm\n-1\n\n region \n\nFigure 13. FTIR spectra of PA 1000 at various UV exposure times. \n\nFigure 14. FTIR spectra of PA 300 at various UV exposure times. \n\n\n\n50 \n \n\n(degradation of the aromatic ring). Contrary to the other absorbance bands, the \n\nbehavior of the O-H region in the PA 300 scaffold isn\u2019t similar to the PA 1000 fibres: \n\nthrough the first 5 minutes there is a slight decrease in the O-H peak related to the \n\nproduction of formates and esters, followed by a boost until 20 minutes of exposure \n\ntime. At this point there is a further decrease until the 40 minutes of UV exposure, \n\nwhen the O-H peak starts to increase again. Finally, during the next 50 minutes of UV \n\nirradiation the O-H absorbance region reaches is maximum intensity and then \n\ndecreases until the end of the treatment.         \n\nThe behavior of the O-H absorbance region in the PA 300 is mainly because of \n\nthe high amount of mono and di-hydroxy-substituted compounds, formed during the \n\nPBT segment degradation, which are also susceptible to interact with the UV light and \n\nconsequently originate a new chain of reactions. One possibility pathway is based on \n\nthe photo-degradation of phenol under UV irradiation (Figure 15) [94,95]. As \n\nschematized in Figure 15, a hydroquinone can originate a P-benzonquinone by a \n\nreversible redox reaction, which is plausible because of the yellowing of the scaffold \n\nduring UV exposure. Further irradiation leads to ring cleavage and formation of low \n\nmass compounds such as carboxylic acids (acetic acids, etc) and finally CO2 [95,96].           \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\nThe differences between the two scaffolds can be further analyzed by \n\ncomparing the areas underneath each absorbance peak. In this way, it will be possible \n\nevaluate the relative changes that occur on the PA 1000 and PA 300 surfaces \n\ncomposition during UV exposure. \n\nAs described above, the peak area between 715 cm\n-1\n\n and 735 cm\n-1\n\n is related  \n\nnot only with the C-H out of plane bending region, but also with the C-H rocking of the \n\nmain chain. The higher crystallinity of the PA 300 is the reason why the peak area is \n\nbigger in this polymer compared with PA 1000. However, as the long PEO chain of the \n\nPA 1000 is able to produce more formates and esters than the small PEO segment in \n\nthe PA 300, PA 1000 will show a superior gain in the peak area during the first 10 \n\nminutes of UV irradiation. The following peak area decreasing is related with scission \n\nchain events and aromatic ring degradation. The results are summarized in Table 2 and \n\nFigure 16.      \n\n \n\nFigure 15. Degradation pathways of phenol under the UV irradiation.   \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n             \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n The PA 1000 and PA 300 C-O-C stretches show similar peak areas before UV \n\nirradiation because of the high PEO content in one case and the repetition of the PBT \n\nchains in other. In a similar way as the C-H aromatic, the formation of formates and \n\nesters in the first 10 minutes occurs in both polymers, resulting in an increasing of the \n\npeak area. Again, the area increasing is more noticeable in the PA 1000 and the \n\ndecreasing in both scaffolds is due to the effect of oxidation and hydrolysis (Table 3 \n\nand Figure 17).     \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2.

However, during the UV irradiation, the formation of esters and formates \n\noccurs and the gain in the peak area of these elements becomes superior in the PA \n\n1000. The reason for that is the molecular structure of the PEO\u2019s oxidation products, \n\nwhich are formed in larger amounts in PA 1000 than in PA 300. Again, the peak areas \n\ndecrease after the initial 10 minutes of UV irradiation.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3.

This is because the large PEO chains that characterizes the molecular \n\nstructure of these fibres. As the hydrogens presented in the main chains of both PA \n\n1000 and PA 300 are deeply involved in the hydrogen abstraction reactions during UV \n\ndegradation, the peak area in this region starts decreasing from the beginning of the \n\nprocess.        \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Contrary to the other regions of interest, the temporal evolution under UV \n\nirradiation of the O-H stretch is not similar for PA 1000 and PA 300. In fact, the relative \n\ngains and losses of this peak area in the PA 1000 are mainly related with the formation \n\nof alcohols and carboxylic acids. As it was explained above, the photo degradation of \n\nthe PEO segments is the most dominant degradation process in PA 1000. In this way, \n\nthe consumption of OH during the first minutes of UV irradiation leads to the \n\nformation of PEO oxidation products; these products (Figure 4) originate the following \n\nFigure 19. FTIR spectra of the C-O zone after various UV exposure times. A) PA 1000 ; B) PA 300. \n\nTable 6. Relative Changes in the C-H peak area for PA1000 (blue) and PA 300 (red) during UV exposure. \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\nboost in the peak area (Table 7 and Figure 21). Although the PBT degradation also \n\noccurs in the PA 1000, it has little influence in the ATR-FTIR spectra because of its \n\nmodest amount in comparison with the PEO present in the PEOT segment.               \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n On the other hand, the relative changes in the O-H peak area of the PA 300 are \n\nrelated with the photo-oxidation of PBT and with the low PEO content on this polymer. \n\nThe formation of PEO oxidation products has a diminutive impact in the OH peak area \n\nevolution; nevertheless it is possible that this process contributes for the small loss in \n\nthe absorbance region during the first 5 minutes of UV irradiation. Besides that, the \n\nfirst increasing of the peak area can be due to the formation of the mono and di-\n\nhydroxy-substituted compounds in the aromatic ring. Following the scheme in the \n\nFigure 7 it is possible that the formation of intermediate compounds like \n\nbenzoquinones leads to the decreasing between the 20 and 40 minutes of UV \n\nexposure; the further degradation of the PA 300 scaffold can originate both \n\nsubstituted phenols and low mass products such as carboxylic acids, leading to a new \n\npeak area increasing during the next 50 minutes. Then, the absorbance band decreases \n\nagain because of the collapse of the aromatic ring and the degradation of the low mass \n\ncompounds. These results are summarized in Table 7 and Figure 21.         \n\n The analysis of the Table 7 also shows that the low molecular weight polymer \n\n(PA 300) presents a higher concentration of hydroxyl groups (OH) before UV exposure. \n\nThis property is related to the chain folding of the PEO segment and it is correlated by \n\nBigger et al. [97].   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 20. FTIR spectra of the C-H zone after various UV exposure times.

As explained above, \n\nthe different time evolutions of both polymers under UV exposure are related to their \n\nmolecular structure and consequently with the competition between the production of \n\nlower molecular weight species and polymer chain/aromatic ring scission events that \n\noccur on their surface.  In fact, the relative changes in the peak areas illustrate \n\nmodifications on surface properties such as wettability and presence of functional \n\ngroups that can largely influence the accessible surface area for protein binding.   \n\nBased on this, it is possible to say that the surfaces of both PA 1000 and PA 300 \n\nare able to offer a considerable number of scenarios to investigate protein adsorption \n\nand cell attachment, depending on the UV exposure time. Two scenarios were chosen \n\nfor both polymers: untreated and 40 minutes of UV exposure. In the case of PA 1000, \n\nthe UV irradiation will introduce reactive hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the surface, \n\nimproving the adhesion of proteins because of the hydrogen bond forming capability \n\nof these chemical groups [98,99]; on the other hand, the benzoquinones present on \n\nTable 7.

The \n\nelemental compositions of PA 1000 and PA 300 before and after UV irradiation are \n\npresented in the Tables 8 and 9 respectively. It can be noted that the carbon and \n\noxygen are the dominant species on both PA 1000 and PA 300 surfaces, however it is \n\nalso observed some impurities like nitrogen on both PA 300 and PA 1000 and \n\nadditional elements like potassium and silicon on the PA 1000 surface.

In contrast, the Table 9 shows a decrease in the \n\nratio O/C due the high OH content on the surface of untreated PA 300 and the \n\nTable 8.

The increasing of carbon after UV exposure on the PA 300 surface can be \n\ndue the high probability of recombination caused by the strong attachment of chains \n\nin crystalline regions [103].     \n\n The C1s region analyses are presented in the Tables 10 and 11 for PA1000 and \n\nPA 300, respectively.   \n\n For both polymers, the C1s analysis of the untreated scaffolds showed four \n\ndifferent peaks (Figures 24 and 25). The peak at 284.8 eV is attributed to C-H aromatic \n\nbonds and to the aliphatic carbon (C-C-C) bonds; the second and third peaks (286.2 eV \n\nand 287.3 eV) are associated with the C-C-O and C-C=O from the ether and ester \n\ngroups, correspondingly. A four peak is located at 288.9 eV and it is related with the O-\n\nC=O bond, also from the ester group. These results are comparable with the results of \n\nRiekerink et al. [104] and Nandakumar et al. [98]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\n The changes in the C1s peaks after 40 minutes of UV irradiation (Figure 24 B \n\nand 25 B) are deeply related with the competition between scission chain events and \n\nformation of new products.  \n\nOn the PA 1000 surface, the fracture of the polymer backbone chain is \n\nassociated to the decreasing at 284.8 eV and the formation of esters, formates and \n\ncarboxylic acids is the origin of the boost in the 288.9 eV after UV exposure. The \n\napparent no effect of the UV treatment at 286.2 eV and 287.3 eV can be related to the \n\nformation of alcohols and other PEO photo-oxidation products (esters, formates and \n\ncarboxylic acids) that balance respectively with the degradation of the originals ethers \n\nand esters.  \n\nTable 10. Fractions of various functional groups from PA 1000 C1s peaks. \n\nTable 11. Fractions of various functional groups from PA 300 C1s peaks. \n\n\n\n60 \n \n\nA different behavior is observed on the PA 300 surface, where the PEO \n\ndegradation is balanced with the high amount of aromatic structures and the ability of \n\nchains recombination, resulting in the preservation of the peak area at 284.8 eV. \n\nAccording to Solomon et al [105], the Cs1 peaks of C=O of benzoquinones and C-OH of \n\nphenols are located at 286.2 eV and 287.3 eV respectively. This means that the \n\nproduction of benzoquinones can be related with the no apparent effect of UV \n\nirradiation at 286.2 eV, despite the ether degradation; the same reasoning can be \n\napplied at 287.3 eV, where the UV irradiation seems to have no effect on the peak \n\narea. In this case the formation of the mono and di-hydroxy-substituted compounds \n\nduring PBT photo-oxidation opposes to the degradation of the original esters. The \n\nboost in the last peak (288.9 eV) can be related to the oxidation products originated \n\nfrom the PEOT degradation and to the formation of carboxylic acids from \n\nbenzoquinone degradation. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 24.

In fact, the molecular rearrangements on the surfaces due the UV irradiation \n\ncan lead to substantial modifications in the amount, type and conformation of the \n\nadsorbed proteins.  \n\nPapenburg et al. [106] have suggested that the swelling ability and the two \n\nphase separation of untreated PEOT/PBT copolymers are significant in the protein \n\nadsorption process. The swelling ability opens the possibility for additional protein \n\nadsorption within the polymer sheet; on the other hand, the singular characteristics of \n\neach phase can lead to the adsorption of different kinds of proteins that express \n\naffinity to either of the phases. So, these and other properties of the material such as \n\nwettability, roughness, topography and the functional groups located on the surface \n\nare able to influence the protein adsorption and consequently the cell attachment via \n\nthese proteins. \n\nThe ability of untreated and UV treated PA 1000 and PA 300 scaffolds adsorb \n\nthe proteins of the serum-enriched medium was tested using FITC-BSA as a model \n\nprotein. Besides the four initial scenarios (PA 1000; PA 1000 + UV; PA 300 and PA 300 + \n\nUV), it is possible create a fifth scenario for the protein adsorption test by adding the 1-\n\nethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride / N-Hydroxysuccinimide \n\n(EDC/NHS) complex to a UV treated scaffold.  \n\nIn fact, the carboxylic acids present on the surface of both polymers after UV \n\nirradiation can be converted to active intermediates (o-acylisourea) by EDC; these \n\nreactive complexes react relatively slowly with amines, so they can be hydrolyzed in \n\naqueous solutions before the coupling occurs. Because of that, NHS can be added to \n\nreact with the active intermediate and form a stable amine-reactive NHS ester that will \n\nbe nucleophilically attacked by the protein to form an amide bond, leading to covalent \n\nlinkage to the polymer\u2019s surface (Figure 26) [107,108]. \n\nTheoretically the carboxylic acids should be mainly produced during PA 1000 \n\ndegradation because of its large amount of PEO, however, the ATR-FTIR and XPS have \n\nshowed that there is also a substantial amount of carboxylic acids on the surface of PA \n\n300 after 40 minutes of UV irradiation.  In this way, both possibilities (PA 1000 + UV \n\nand PA 300 + UV) were explored with the adding of the NHS/EDC complex. Relative to \n\nthe untreated samples of PA 300 (Figure 27) and PA 1000 (Figure 28), there is no \n\ndetectable fluorescence before or after incubation in a FITC-BSA / PBS solution. This \n\ninformation excludes respectively auto-fluorescence and protein absorption \n\ninterference in the fluorescence microscope images.      \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n On the other hand, after 40 minutes of UV irradiation, the fibres of both \n\nelectrospun scaffolds show fluorescence in the blue channel. This fact can be related \n\nwith the degradation of superficial chromophores and with the photo / thermo \n\noxidation of the PBT segment. The effect of the UV exposure on the surface of PA 1000 \n\nand PA 300 can also be proved by the detection of fluorescence proteins after \n\nincubation in a FITC-BSA / PBS solution.    \n\n According to the Figures 29 and 30, the addition of the EDC/NHS complex \n\nseems to produce no visible difference in the protein adsorption process. This means \n\nthat the modifications that occur on the surface of the PA 1000 and PA 300 fibres \n\nduring UV irradiation are sufficient to expand the availability of the surface areas to \n\nprotein adsorption. It is also true that the process of functionalization became simpler \n\nwithout the introduction of this complex.      \n\n In order to have a better control on the spatial distribution of the functional \n\ngroups on the surface of the fibres, we used a mask (linear patterning) between the \n\nsurface and the UV light source before the FITC-BSA / PBS incubation period. As \n\nexpected, the results show activate areas (green) regularly separated by non active \n\nareas. The results are illustrated in the Figure 31. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 26.

Cell response \n\nAdhesion is a cell type dependant process that involves a complex network of \n\nsequential events including attachment, spreading and growth, followed by other \n\nprocess like cell differentiation, migration and production of extra-cellular matrix \n\n(ECM) molecules [109,110]. This chain of physical interactions, chemical binding and \n\nbiological signaling processes is highly influenced by the polymeric surface properties. \n\n In fact, Arima et al. [111] have separated the cell-polymeric substrate \n\ninteractions into four phases: adsorption of proteins from the medium to the surface, \n\napproach of cells to the surface, cell attachment and cell spreading.  As explained \n\nbefore, the functional groups present on the surface of both PA 1000 and PA 300 \n\ndetermine the amount and the rate of the protein adsorption from the culture \n\nmedium.  \n\n Initially, the cells approach the surface due to electrostatic, van der Waals and \n\nsteric forces and also because of the gravity since the cells are denser than the culture \n\nmedium.  The more specific interactions that include the interaction between the \n\ntransbembrane linking protein integrin and the proteins located on the polymer \n\nsurface will then control the cell attachment. Adding to the proteins primarily \n\nFigure 31.

The fibronectin \n\nproduced by the cells has a very important role in supporting the cell spreading \n\n[111,112]. \n\n The influence of the changes provoked by UV irradiation on the surfaces of \n\nboth PA 1000 and PA 300 in the cell attachment process was tested with Rat Swann \n\nCells, which are glial cells of the peripheral nervous system usually used for nerve \n\ntissue regeneration applications [113,114]. In culture, this cell line can show either a \n\nflat morphology or a spindle-shaped morphology with an oval nucleus and long \n\nprocess [115]. In fact, the results (Figures 32 - 37) show these two types of morphology \n\nin untreated and UV treated scaffolds; however it seems that the flattened pattern is \n\nmore dominant in the PA 1000 samples.  \n\n The UV irradiated samples show a larger number of cells than the untreated \n\nscaffolds. This can be related to the increasing in the number of functional groups \n\navailable after UV exposure, which consequently leads to an increase in the protein \n\nadsorption from the culture medium. This fact is also proved when the PA 1000 and PA \n\n300 are patterned by the UV mask because the attachment of the Rat Schwann Cells \n\noccurs mostly on the UV activated areas.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 32.

In both \n\ncases, the cells show a predominant flat shape with several extensions. A similar \n\nanalysis can be made by observing the areas 3 (untreated PA 300) and 4 (UV treated \n\nPA 300), since it is also possible to see no considerable change of cell morphology in \n\nboth conditions: bipolar and tri-polar extensions with spindle shaped morphology.  \n\n Similarly to other studies [113,116], the aligned fibres of the electrospun \n\nscaffolds work as guidance cues for the Rat Schwann cells grow. In fact, it is possible \n\nthat the aligned nanofibres influence the organization of the Rat Schwann Cells into \n\ncolumns called bands of B\u00fcngner during the proliferation stage [116]. Although it is \n\nunlikely to Rat Schwann Cells proliferation takes place during the culture period used \n\nin this experiment (12h), it is possible to see cell columns in both PA 1000 (Figure 28 B) \n\nand PA 300 (Figure 31, zone 4) after UV irradiation.         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 34.

Electrospinning PA fibres with \n\nfunctional groups \n\nAlthough the mechanical and chemical properties of the PA 300 already show \n\ngood levels of biocompatibility and biodegradability, they do not allow a selective \n\nadsorption process able to permit the immobilization of specific biomolecules on the \n\nsurface. In order to accomplish that, blend solutions of PA 300 and functionalized PEG \n\nlinkers were electrospun in order to place chemical groups on the surface of the fibres \n\nfor further functionalization without the need of surface modification techniques like \n\nPlasma treatment or UV irradiation.

(bis)PEG-SVA/Amine reaction \n\nThe Succinimidyl valerate poly(ethylene glicol) succinimidyl valerate (SVA-PEG-\n\nSVA or (bis)PEG-SVA) is an amino (-NH2)  homobifunctional reactive PEG derivate that \n\ncan be used for the PEGylation of substances with  available amino groups such as \n\nproteins (Figure 38). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 38. Molecular structure of (bis)PEG-SVA. \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\n Indeed, due the presence of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters on SVA-PEG-\n\nSVA molecular structure allows a nucleopholic attack and consequently the formation \n\nof stable amide linkage with NHS loss (Figure 39). This reaction competes with the \n\nhydrolysis of the NHS esters and because of that it should occur near physiological \n\nconditions (pH between 7 and 8.5) [107,117].  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe selectivity of PEG-NHS polymers towards primary amine terminals is \n\ncommonly used in drug delivery applications because the attachment of PEG to \n\ntherapeutic proteins leads to an increase in drug efficiency by reducing \n\nimmunogenicity and enzymatic digestion, at same time that also induces an increasing \n\nin solubility and in the serum half life. In fact, several PEGylated protein conjugates \n\nwere already FDA approved and are commercially available [118,119]. In addition to \n\nthis, the PEG-NHS / PEG SVA polymers can be also employed in the incorporation of \n\nadhesion peptides or proteins on the scaffolds surfaces in order to modulate cell-\n\nsurface interaction. Some tissue engineering applications include surface gradients \n\n[120], generation of protein adherent and non adherent areas [121,122], construction \n\nof hydrogel scaffolds [123] and nanoparticles surface customization [124]. Another \n\nexample was reported by Delong et al. [125] that build a system able to immobilize \n\nbasic fibroblast growth factor to hydrogel scaffolds via acryloyl-PEG-NHS in order to \n\nstudy protein gradient effects on vascular smooth muscle cell behavior and direct their \n\nmigration. \n\nThe chemical composition of the (bis)PEG-SVA described above was confirmed \n\nby the \n1\nH-NMR spectrum of (bis)PEG-SVA (Figure 40). The peak related to the C-H bond \n\nof the PEG backbone chain (3.70 ppm) is clearly the most intense because of its huge \n\nproportion in the molecular structure relatively to the NHS ester. The tiny peaks at \n\n2.90 ppm, 2.70 ppm and 1.8 ppm are associated with the CH2 in the ? position, with \n\nthe CH2 present on the NHS and with the C-H bond in the ? position, respectively.   \n\nFigure 39.

Scaffold characterization \n\nThe ATR-FTIR spectra of the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA (Figure 41) shows a \n\ndominance of the PEOT/PBT components over the functional PEG. This situation is not \n\ncompletely unexpected since the proportion of this components is 4 times higher than \n\nthe (bis)PEG-SVA component.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThere is a intense absorbance peak in the C-H stretch region associated with \n\nthe Backbone chain of PEO (2840 \u2013 3000 cm\n-1\n\n), it is also possible to see the ether C-O-C \n\nstretch band at 1102 cm-\n1\n and the ester C-O and C=O absorbance peaks at 1270 cm\n\n-1\n \n\nFigure 40.

The aromatic C-H out of plane region is located between \n\n715 \u2013 735 cm\n-1\n\n and the O-H region (3100 and 3700 cm\n-1\n\n) is nearly negligible.  \n\nIndeed, the spectrum of PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA is almost similar to the \n\nspectrum of PA 300 showed before (section 5.1.): both spectra present the same \n\nabsorbance bands, with their only difference being the peak areas (Figures 42 \u2013 44 and \n\nTable 12). In fact, the addition of (bis)PEG-SVA before the electrospinning process \n\ncause the increasing of the polymer backbone chain and consequently a boost in the C-\n\nO-C, C-O and C-H (main chain) regions. The PEG content is also responsible for the high \n\nwater absorption during the electrspinning and consequently for the increasing of the \n\nO-H region. As expected, there is no significant change in the aromatic C-H region.   \n\nTheoretically, the NHS terminals should present three characteristic bands at \n\n17019 cm\n-1\n\n, 1745 cm\n-1\n\n and 1818 cm\n-1\n\n related respectively with the symmetric and \n\nasymmetric C=O stretches of NHS and with the carbonyl stretch of the NHS ester \n\n[126,127]. Although since none of these peaks are identified individually, it is possible \n\nthat the increasing of the C=O peak area is due the presence of NHS-esters on the \n\nsurface of the fibres.              \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 42.

So, the carbon and oxygen are the \n\ndominate species on the scaffold\u2019s surface and there is a vestigial trace of nitrogen. \n\nThese results make sense because it was not expectable to see a huge percentage of \n\nnitrogen on the surface due the proportion between PA 300 and (bis)PEG-SVA used; \n\nhowever the presence of the (bis)PEG-SVA is reflected in the higher amount of carbon \n\nand nitrogen on the surface comparing with PA 300 (Table 9).           \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 44.

The comparison with PA 300 (Table 9 \nand Figure 24 A) reveals a huge increment in the peak area associated with the C-C-O \n\nether bond, which is explained by the higher amount of PEG in the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-\n\nSVA scaffold; and in addition to this, it is also possible associate this peak with the C-N \n\nbond [122].      \n\n Furthermore, it was also made an N1s analysis to both PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA \n\nand PA 300 in order to compare their functional groups and identify the NHS-ester \n\nterminals on the surface of the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA fibres. The results (Table 15) \n\nshow a common peak at 399.2 eV, which can be associated to nitrogen contamination. \n\nOn the other hand it is possible to observe a second peak at 401.5 eV that only exist in \n\nthe PA 300 + PEG-SVA scaffold, indicating the presence of the NHS-esters [128] on the \n\nsurface of the fibres.    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 14.

Protein adsorption \n\nAs explained previously (section 5.2), the protein adsorption success is highly \n\ndependent on the surface characteristics, so the changes promoted by the adding of \n\n(bis)PEG-SVA to PA 300 should increase substantially the ability of the electrospun \n\nfibres adsorb the proteins.  \n\nIn addition to the ATR-FTIR and XPS results that already have showed the \n\npresence of NHS-esters on the surface of the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA fibres, the scaffold \n\nwas also tested using FITC-BSA as a model protein to simulate the adsorption of the \n\nserum-enriched medium before cell seeding.  \n\nThe results presented in Figure 46 confirm that only the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA \n\nafter incubation in a FITC-BSA / PBS solution was able to show detectable fluorescence. \n\nThis means that the functional groups are indeed present on the surface of scaffold, \n\ncontributing to protein adsorption. Similarly to the PA 300 fluorescence microscope \n\nimages showed in section 5.2, the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA didn\u2019t show any auto-\n\nfluorescence.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 15.

PolyActive + (bis)PEG-Alkyne electrospun \n\nfibres \n\nA blend solution of PA 300 and (bis)PEG-Alkyne was successfully electrospun \n\nwith the purpose of placing terminal alkynes on the surface of the fibres to promote \n\nclick chemistry reactions with azide functionalized biomolecules. Although the \n\npresence of alkynes was not totally confirmed via ATR-FTIR and XPS spectroscopy, the \n\nPA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne scaffold was able to successfully immobilize an azide dye and \n\nconsequently prove the existence of alkyne functional groups on the surface of the \n\nfibres. The chemical composition of the (bis)PEG-Alkyne was investigated via NMR \n\nanalysis. \n\n6.2.1. (bis)PEG-Alkyne/Azide reaction \n\nThe reaction between an azide and an alkyne terminals of the (bis)PEG-Alkyne \n\nis one example of the click chemistry cycloaddition reactions, that are included in a \n\nlarger group of chemical processes denominated Click Chemistry. The concept behind \n\nClick Chemistry is mainly related with the creation of substances by exploring simple \n\nreactions that are efficient at link two components under simple reaction conditions \n\nand fast reaction times [129,130].   \n\nThe most popular cycloaddition reaction is referred as the Huisgen 1,3-dipolar \n\ncycloaddition reaction, which can occur through either of two alternative pathways \n\ndescribed in Figure 47 in order to produce 1,2,3-triazoles. The more classical approach \n\nis purely thermal and produce both 1,4- and 1,5-regioisomers in a ratio 1:1, however \n\nbecause of the elevated temperatures and long reaction time required it is not very \n\npractical. So, Sharpless et al. [131]  have described a variant of the original process to \n\naccelerate the cycloaddition reaction by using Cu(I) as catalyst. In fact, the addition of \n\nCu(I) dramatically accelerates the kinetics of the reaction and allows it to be almost \n\nsolvent insensitive and occur under ambient pressures and room temperature. As it is \n\npossible to see in the Figure 47, the Cu(I) catalyzed variation of the Huisgen 1,3-dipolar \n\ncycloaddition of azides and alkynes improves the regioselectivity to generate only the \n\n1,4-regioisomer [107,129,130,132].  \n\n The simplicity of the click chemistry reactions has led to its application in tissue \n\nengineering strategies and materials science, mainly with the conjugation of polymers \n\nwith biological entities such as peptides, proteins, viruses and cells [129]. In this way, \n\nthe molecular structure of the (bis)PEG-Alkyne (Figure 48) transform this polymer into \n\na suitable candidate for many applications of the azide-alkyne click approach, such as \n\nsynthesis of hydrogels [133] and polymer surface functionalization [134,135].  \n\n \n\n\n\n77 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n The chemical composition of the (bis)PEG-Alkyne was evaluated by a H-NMR \n\nanalysis (Figure 49). The more intense peak is located at 3.70 ppm and it is related with \n\nthe dominant presence of the PEG backbone chain (CH2) at the molecular structure. \n\nThe peaks at 1.90 ppm and 2.4 ppm are related respectively with the alkyne proton \n\nand with CH2 adjacent to the triple bond carbon. Finally, the peak located at 4.2 ppm is \n\nprobably related with the methylene protons of 4-pentynoic acid that is used during \n\nthe Alkyne-PEG-Alkyne synthesis [136].      \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 47.

Scaffold characterization \n\nThe PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA ATR-FTIR spectrum (Figure 50) presents the same \n\npeaks as the PA 300 by itself (section 5.1.): the region between 2840 cm\n-1\n\n and 3000  \n\ncm\n-1\n\n is dominated by the C-H stretch from the Backbone chain of PEO, the ether C-O-C \n\nstretch band is located at 1102 cm\n-1\n\n, the ester stretches C-O and C=O are situated \n\nrespectively at 1270 cm\n-1\n\n and 1714 cm\n-1\n\n, the area between 715 cm\n-1\n\n  and 735 cm\n-1\n\n is \n\nrelated with the aromatic C-H out of plane region and the O-H region (3100 and 3700 \n\ncm\n-1\n\n) is not significant. Indeed, the spectrum show a clearly dominance of the \n\nPEOT/PBT components that together with the PEG chain from the (bis)PEG-SVA \n\nsuppress the characteristic bands of the Alkyne terminals. Theoretically these \n\ncharacteristic bands should be the C?C-H bend (610 - 700 cm\n-1\n\n), the C?C stretch (2100-\n\n2260 cm\n-1\n\n) and the C?C-H stretch (3270-3330 cm\n-1\n\n). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n The comparison between the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne and the PA 300 scaffold \n\nhas showed, as expected, some changes on the peak areas but not in the absorbance \n\nbands locations. It is possible to see from the Figures 51-53 and from the analysis of \nthe Table 16, that the influence of the PEG during the scaffold fabrication is reflected \n\nin the increasing of the polymer backbone and therefore in the associated areas (C-O-\n\nC, C-O and C-H (main chain) regions). Similarly to what was explained for the PA 300 + \n\n(bis)PEG-SVA scaffold, the addition of PEG-Alkyne before the electrospinning process \n\nbrings consequences for the hydrophilic properties of the fibres, that are then able to \n\nabsorb more water than the PA 300 by itself. Then as consequence of the increase in \n\nthe water absorption levels in the PA 300 + PEG-Alkyne scaffold, there is an increase in \n\nthe O-H region comparing with the PA 300 scaffold.         \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 50.

The comparison between the PA 300 (section 5.1.) and the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-\n\nAlkyne (Table 18) shows, as expected, that there is a substantial increment in the C-C-\n\nO peak area in the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne scaffold probably due the addition of the \n\nPEG segments before electrospinning. The high PEG content on the scaffold is also the \n\nmotive for a small O/C ratio (0.59) showed in the element composition table.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 16.

Click Chemistry tests \n\nSince the ATR-FTIR and XPS results were not conclusive about the presence of \n\nalkyne functional groups on the surface of the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA fibres, a new \n\napproach was followed by using a fluorescent azide in order to induce the azide-alkyne \n\ncycloaddition reaction and then locate the functional groups. Although the usual click \n\nchemistry approaches involved a Cu(I) catalyst, the protocol followed (section 4.5) did \n\nnot include any catalyst. This was because, contrary to the (bis)PEG-Alkyne by itself, \n\nthe alkynes on the surface of the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne electrospun scaffold are \n\ninfluenced by neighboring electron-withdrawing functional groups such as the ester \n\nand the carbonyl groups from the PA 300, leading to the formation of the cycloaddition \n\nproducts at room temperature and in a aqueous medium [137]. In addition to this, the \n\nhigh local alkyne concentration present on the surface of the scaffold due the \n\nproportion of PA 300:(bis)PEG-Alkyne (4:1) can also induce the Huisgen 1,3-dipolar \n\ncycloaddition reaction without the need of a catalyst [138]. Indeed, the properties of \n\nthe PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne by inducing the alkyne-azide click chemistry reaction \n\nwithout Cu(I),  can avoid the toxic nature of the cooper catalysis [134,139].  \n\nFigure 54.

The first condition allows to exclude the relevance \n\nof the azide absorption process in the detectable fluorescence; on the other hand, as \n\nthe PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne scaffold before azide incubation didn\u2019t show \n\nfluorescence, the auto-fluorescence process is also excluded.     \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 55.

Discussion \n\nThe selection of PolyActive as biomaterial was made not only because of its \n\nphysical and mechanical properties such as elasticity and toughness, but also because \n\nit is a well studied polymer with good levels of biocompatibility and biodegradability. \n\nFurthermore, this copolymer was already successfully electrospun and adapted for \n\nseveral tissue engineering applications due its versatility.  \n\nAs explained in previous chapters, by shifting the weight ratios of the PEOT and \n\nPBT segments and the molecular weight of the PEG, a wide range of polymers with \n\ndistinct mechanical, biological and physicochemical properties can be obtained. \n\nPapadaki et al. [19] have studied the effects of different PEGT/PBT weight percentages \n\nand two different molecular weights (300 Da and 1000 Da) of PEG in the behavior of \n\ntwo different cell lines: skeletal muscle cells and chondrocytes. The results have \n\nshowed that the cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation depend not only on \n\nthe copolymer composition, but also on the cell type used. In fact, the skeletal muscle \n\ncells exhibited maximum attachment, proliferation and differentiation on the \n\n300PEGT55PBT45 substrate comparing with their response on the other scaffolds. On \n\nthe other hand, chondrocytes exhibited a more pronounced cell response (attachment \n\nand proliferation) on the 1000PEGT70PBT30 substrate. The differences between the \n\ntwo scaffolds are more pronounced on the skeletal muscle cells behavior since their \n\nattachment is similar for 300PEGT55PBT45 and 1000PEGT55PBT45, but the \n\nproliferation is more accentuated on the 300PEGT55PBT45. This allows to conclude \n\nthat for this particular cell line, the PEGT weight percentage is crucial for cell \n\nattachment purposes and the PEG molecular weight is important for proliferation. \n\nGenerally, the scaffolds with higher percentage of PEOT (or PEGT) or higher PEG \n\nmolecular weight present a more hydrophilic surface, which leads to a considerable \n\nhigher water uptake and consequently to an elevated absorption of biomolecules and \n\nchanges on the surface due swelling. The absorption process by annulling the \n\nadsorption of medium proteins and adhesion molecules on the surface of the scaffolds \n\ncan reduce the attachment of cells that require a high level of adhesion biomolecules. \n\nIn addition to this, longer PEG chains originate instability on the surface, leading to an \n\ninhibition of cell lines that exhibit high tensile stress.  \n\nThe most popular PEOT/PBT copolymers combinations are 300PEOT55PBT45 \n\nand 1000PEOT70PBT30, and according to the literature, the PA 300 (55/45) induce \n\nsuperior cell responses and the PA 1000 (70/30) present better in vivo degradation. \n\nAlthough these scaffolds are commonly used in bone and skin tissue regeneration \n\napplications, modifications on their surfaces can help to optimize the advantages and \n\nreduce their weakness in order to produce more adaptable and suitable scaffolds for \n\ntissue engineering processes.  \n\n\n\n85 \n \n\nIn the chapter 5 it was described that the introduction of oxygen containing \n\nfunctional groups to the PA 1000 surface via UV irradiation can influence protein \n\nadsorption and cell attachment. According to the ATR-FTIR analysis, there is a \n\ncontinuously increasing O-H peak area after the first 10 minutes of UV exposure, while \n\nthere is a decrease in the ester, ether and aromatic associated peaks. This means that \n\nthe functional groups are probably hydroxyl and carboxyl generated due the photo-\n\noxidation of the PEO segment. The introduction of these oxygen groups are \n\ncorroborated by the XPS results, which presents an increase on the O/C ratio after 40 \n\nminutes of UV irradiation.  \n\nContrary to PA 1000, the modifications on the PA 300 electrospun fibres \n\nthrough UV exposure are mostly influenced by the degradation of the PBT segment, \n\nwhich results in the appearance of mono and di-hydroxy-substituted compounds on \n\nthe aromatic rings. The instability of these compounds is visible in the evolution of the \n\nO-H ATR-FTIR peak area during 180 minutes of UV treatment: simultaneously to a \n\ndecrease in the ATR-FTIR peak areas associated with the backbone main chain, the O-H \n\nregion showed an oscillatory behavior during the first 90 minutes of UV exposure. This \n\ncan be explained by the instability of the mono and di-hydroxy-substituted \n\ncompounds, which can easily originate P-benzonquinones via a reversible redox \n\nreaction. After this period, a collapse of the aromatic ring is noticeable due to the \n\ndecreasing O-H peak. The formation of P-benzonquinones is supported by the visible \n\nyellowing of the scaffolds and via XPS analysis by the decreasing on the O/C ratio after \n\n40 minutes of UV exposure.     \n\nThe scaffolds were treated by UV irradiation during 40 minutes with purpose of \n\nevaluating the influence that the oxygen containing functional groups on the PA 1000 \n\nsurface and the presence of P-benzonquinones on the PA 300 surface have on the \n\nprotein adsorption and cell attachment processes.  \n\nFor both scaffolds, the fluorescent microscope observations were made by \n\nusing the FITC-BSA protein as model protein. The comparison between untreated and \n\ntreated samples showed that the detectable fluorescence only came from the UV \n\ntreaded scaffolds after FITC-BSA incubation, excluding the auto-fluorescence and the \n\nprotein absorption phenomena influence on these observations. It was also tried an \n\noptimization of these results by adding the EDC/NHS complex in both scaffolds before \n\nFITC-BSA incubation; and, although the presence of carboxylic acids on the surface of \n\nboth PA 1000 and PA 300 was observed after 40 minutes under UV irradiation, there \n\nwas no detectable changes in the detectable fluorescent in the two cases. Because of \n\nthat and to simplify the surface functionalization process, the EDC/NHS complex was \n\neliminated from the methodology followed for the evaluation of the cell response. \n\nHowever, in the future, the influence of the EDC/NHS complex should be tested with a \n\nprotein quantification process like the ninhydrin test. The protein adsorption tests also \n\n\n\n86 \n \n\nincluded the modification of the fibre surface with a spatially defined UV exposure by \n\nusing a mask for spatial patterning. The results show successfully and spatially \n\ncontrolled alterations in the degree of FITC-BSA adsorption on both UV treated \n\nscaffolds. \n\nThe results presented by the protein adsorption tests were confirmed by the \n\ninteraction between the Rat Schwann Cells and the untreated and treated electrospun \n\nscaffolds. Although they had successfully attached on untreated and treated surfaces \n\nof both PA 1000 and PA 300 scaffolds, there was a clear preference for the activated \n\nareas on the surfaces treated with the UV mask, which means that there are more \n\nfunctional groups available after UV irradiation, and consequently more adsorbed \n\nadhesion proteins in these locations. This can be also validated by the higher number \n\nof cells on the UV treated scaffolds, comparing with the untreated samples. \n\nThe changes on the morphology of the cells were not noticeable between \n\nuntreated and treated surfaces. However the PEG molecular weight and the \n\npercentage of the copolymers PEOT/PBT seem to affect Rat Schwann cells \n\nmorphology. Indeed, when cultured on the PA 1000 samples, the cells showed a \n\nflattened pattern. On the other end, on the surface of the PA 300, the cells presented a \n\nspindle shaped morphology. Similar differences were reported by Chew et al. [140], \n\nthat have studied the effects of aligned and random PCL fibrous scaffolds in the \n\nmorphology of the Rat Schwann cells. The results showed that the cells were able to \n\nelongate unidirectionally along the fibre axes on aligned electrospun, but when \n\ncultured on a random fibrous scaffold, the cells adopted a random orientation and a \n\nspread-out morphology. Based on these results, there is a possibility that the \n\nvariations in the cell morphology may occur due to slight differences in the alignment \n\nof the electrospun fibres in both PA 1000 and PA 300. One hypothesis is that, although \n\nthe same electrospinning set up was used for both copolymers, the PA 1000 \n\nelectrospinning jet was able to discharge its electric charge more efficiently to the \n\nwater vapor molecules in the atmosphere, comparing with the PA 300 jet that is more \n\nhydrophobic. As a considerable portion of the charge from the PA 1000 jet is \n\ndischarged during electrospinning, the generated fibres will be less charged and, \n\nconsequently, the influence of the electrodes that are responsible for their alignment \n\nwill be less significant. In addition to this, the long PEG chains and the high PEO \n\ncontent of the PA 1000 can easily be affected by the aqueous environment during the \n\ncell culture protocol, leading to an increasing instability on the polymer backbone \n\nchain that can originate deviations from the original fibre alignment. Finally, in order to \n\ncomplete the analysis described in the section 5.3, a Real-time PCR analysis can be \n\ndone in the future with the purpose of study the maturation of the Rat Schwann cells \n\non the PA 300 and PA 1000 untreated and treated scaffolds [140]; another possibility is \n\nusing other cell line, such as skeletal muscle cells, that need more adhesion proteins on \n\nthe surface to attach, than the rat Schwann cells [19]. In this way it would be easier to \n\n\n\n87 \n \n\nobserve differences in the attachment process between untreated and UV treated \n\nPolyActive samples.  \n\nThe modification of the PA 300 and PA 1000 surfaces by UV irradiation proved \n\nto be able to improve protein adsorption and it has also showed promising results in \n\nenhancing cell attachment. So, it is reasonable to consider UV treatment as a valid \n\nalternative to other PolyActive functionalization techniques such as plasma activation. \n\nClaase et al. [141] have exhaustively explored strategies to functionalize the surface of \n\nPA 1000 scaffolds: firstly, they used acidic and alkaline treatments to modify the \n\nsurface, however the acidic treatment did not enhance cell attachment and growth \n\nand the alkaline treatment has resulted in severe surface degradation. In another \n\napproach, hydroxyapatite (HA) was incorporated on the PA 1000 scaffolds to augment \n\nthe proteins adsorption and consequently increase the bone marrow stromal cell \n\nadhesion and growth. This methodology only showed positive results on particular \n\nareas of the scaffold because the cells were able to attach to the added HA but not to \n\nthe copolymer. The same authors have explored the effects of the CO2 gas plasma \n\ntreatment on the surface of the PA 1000 films, and likewise what was described in \n\nchapter 5, it resulted in the generation of oxygen containing functional groups on the \n\nsurface of the scaffold and in a subsequent increment of protein adsorption from the \n\nmedium, leading to an effective attachment of the bone marrow stromal cells. In \n\nanother approach, Nandakumar et al. [98] have successfully modify the surface of     \n\nPA 300 electrospun scaffolds via oxygen plasma in order to optimize the human \n\nmesenchymal stromal cells (hMSC) adhesion and proliferation. It was demonstrated \n\nthat the treated scaffolds showed higher oxygen content on their surface, comparing \n\nto the untreated ones, which is associated with the presence of functional groups like \n\nhydroxyl and carboxyl. These functional groups were able to enhance the medium \n\nprotein adsorption process, leading to an improved attachment and proliferation of \n\nthe hMSC.       \n\nThe strategies described above can be optimized by incorporating \n\nfunctionalized PEG linkers on the surface with the purpose of having a preferential \n\nimmobilization of functional biomolecules or nanostructures. In this way, a single \n\nscaffold is able to possess binding areas with specific affinities in order to selectively \n\nimmobilize biomolecules on particular regions of the surface and consequently build a \n\ncomplex and organized cell guide system.      \n\nAn innovative and original technique to modify the PA 300 (55/45) surface is \n\nsuggested in the chapter 6. The strategy adopted in this chapter has the purpose of \n\nmodifying the surface of the PA 300 electrospun scaffold by adding functionalized PEG \n\nin the polymer solution before the electrospinning process. The goal is endow the \n\ncopolymer surface with specific functional groups without previous surface treatments \n\nor incubation periods. The Figure 58 compare the approach suggested on chapter 6 \n\n\n\n88 \n \n\n(strategy A) with the common procedure for incorporate functionalized PEG linkers on \n\nthe surface of electrospun scaffolds (strategy B). Basically, the strategy A describes \n\nthat the functionalized PEG should be mixed together with the polymer in a blending \n\nsolution before the electrospinning process. At the end, the fibres should have \n\nincorporated the functional groups on their surface for further biomolecule \n\nimmobilization. The success of this strategy will open the window for new surface \n\nmodification methodologies since it is a much efficient and practical approach than the \n\nstrategy B, which describes a complex approach: in the first phase of the process, the \n\npolymer of interest is electrospun; then, depending on the intrinsic characteristics of \n\nthe fibrous scaffold, the resultant fibres can be treated by a specific surface \n\nmodification technique, leading to the formation of functional groups able to crosslink \n\nwith one terminal of the functionalized PEG during an incubation period. The other \n\nterminal of the functionalized PEG will then immobilize specific biomolecules. The \n\nstrategy B was described in the section 5.2, when the complex NHS/EDC was \n\nincorporated on the surface of both PA 1000 and PA 300 electrospun fibres.        \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n      \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe incorporation of the functionalized PEG linkers can lead to an increase in \n\nthe chain instability of the target polymer because augmenting its length also increases \n\nthe hydrophilic properties of the polymer. Therefore, to avoid a fast degradation by \n\nFigure 58. Incorporation of functionalized PEG linkers on the surface of electrospun scaffolds by two \ndifferent strategies. \n\n\n\n89 \n \n\nhydrolysis and to ensure a proper polymer length, the copolymer PA 300 was selected \n\nto test the viability of the strategy A. The (bis)PEG-SVA and (bis)PEG-Alkyne were \n\nchosen as functionalized PEG linkers because they allow to explore two different kinds \n\nof immobilization processes: by the NHS-ester \u2013 protein interaction (section 6.1.1.) and \n\nvia the \u201cclick chemistry\u201d approach (section 6.2.1.).   \n\nThe PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA ATR-FTIR spectrum allowed to confirm a higher \n\npolymer backbone length, comparing with PA 300 by itself, but it was not conclusive \n\nabout the presence of NHS on the surface of the fibres. However, this result is \n\nacceptable since the proportion of PA 300 per (bis)PEG-SVA is 4:1, and therefore it is \n\nplausible that the peaks originated from the NHS stretches, which are usually located \n\nat 1719 cm\n-1\n\n, 1745 cm\n-1\n\n and 1818 cm\n-1\n\n, are barely noticeable. On the other hand, the \n\nXPS analysis was able to prove the presence of the NHS-ester on the surface of the \n\nfibres by the appearance of one peak at 401.5 eV, which can be associated with this \n\nfunctional group. The FITC-BSA was used as model protein to test the ability of the \n\nPA300 + (bis)PEG-SVA in immobilize proteins. The results have definitely confirmed the \n\npresence of the functional groups on the surface of the fibres since the only detectable \n\nfluorescence signal was originated from the PA300 + (bis)PEG-SVA scaffold after FITC-\n\nBSA incubation. \n\nThe ATR-FTIR and XPS analysis of the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne scaffolds were \n\nonly able to demonstrate the increase of the polymer chain due the adding of the \n\n(bis)PEG-Alkyne (section 6.2.2.), in fact none of the spectra have showed new peaks. \n\nHowever, the presence of the alkyne terminals on the surface of the fibres was \n\nconfirmed by the click chemistry test (section 6.2.3.). Indeed, the fluorescent azides \n\nwere immobilized only by the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne electrospun scaffolds.    \n\nAlthough the presented results allow to conclude that the PEG linker functional \n\ngroups were successfully incorporated on the surface of the scaffolds, it would be \n\ninteresting, in the future, to test the cell response (adhesion, proliferation and \n\ndifferentiation) on similar scaffolds and also analyze the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA and PA \n\n300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne electrospun scaffolds via TOF-SIMS, which is the most sensitive \n\nsurface analysis technique.     \n\nIn summary, the strategy followed in chapter 6 proved to be a simple and \n\nefficient approach to functionalize electrospun scaffolds. In fact, comparing to other \n\nsurface modification techniques such as the one presented on chapter 5, this original \n\napproach avoids a large variety of disadvantages like degradation due photo-exposure \n\nor hydrolysis, as well as other problems related with energetic beams like wave \n\ndiffraction, scattering and backscattering. One possible application for this surface \n\nmodification technique is the fabrication of electrospun scaffolds with two different \n\ntypes of fibres, resulting in two incorporated chemical groups for later \n\nfunctionalization.  This approach involves an adaptation of the traditional \n\n\n\n90 \n \n\nelectrospinning set up since it demands that two spinnerets electrospin the different \n\nbending solutions (Polymer A + functionalized PEG linker A and Polymer B + \n\nfunctionalized PEG linker B) at same time. Then, the right conformation of the \n\nelectrodes will generate a scaffold divided by two different types of fibres with distinct \n\nfunctional groups. As each kind of fibre has affinity with one specific type of \n\nbiomolecule, it will be possible to functionalize the electrospun scaffold with high \n\nspatial definition. This type of scaffold could be very helpful for tissue engineering \n\napplications that involve the segregation of a mixed cell population since different cell \n\nlines have affinity with different type of biomolecules (Figure 59).     \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 59. Segregation of a mixed cell population.   \n\n\n\n91 \n \n\n8. Conclusion \n\nThe design and fabrication of biofunctional tissue engineering scaffolds involve \n\na wide range of challenges from the selection of the bulk material to the tailoring of \n\nthe mechanical, physical and biological functionalities. So, towards developing the next \n\ngeneration of tissue regenerative interfaces, electrospun scaffolds of PEOT/PBT \n\ncopolymers were successfully produced in order to provide topographical and \n\nbiochemical cues for cell guidance. Indeed, the scaffolds were designed and fabricated \n\nto mimic the natural extracellular cell matrix by including aligned fibres and chemical \n\nfunctional groups on their surface for later biomolecules immobilization.   \n\nThe alignment and deposition of the electrospun fibres were managed by using \n\nthe gap method under a controlled environment and the biochemical cues were \n\nintroduced on the surface after the application of two distinct surface modification \n\ntechniques: UV irradiation and incorporation of functionalized PEG linkers.  \n\nIn the study presented in the Chapter 5 it was shown that UV irradiation can be \n\nused to modify the surface properties of both PA 300 and PA 1000 electrospun \n\nscaffolds by introducing new functional groups onto the scaffolds surfaces in order to \n\nimprove the protein adsorption from the culture medium and consequently increase \n\nthe available areas for cell adhesion. These areas could be spatially controlled by using \n\na UV mask able to modify the degree of protein adsorption on electrospun fibres and \n\nconsequently provide different cell responses (cell attachment, proliferation, \n\ndifferentiation, migration) on the same scaffold, depending on the copolymer \n\ncomposition and on the cell type used. In addition to this, the UV treatment offers the \n\nopportunity to create complex surface compositions for both soft- and hard-tissue \n\napplications because it can enhance the immobilization of proteins independently of \n\nthe variations in the PEOT/PBT weight percentage and in the PEG molecular weight \n\npresent on the copolymer composition.   \n\nThe innovative approach investigated in the Chapter 6 described the \n\nincorporation of the functional groups originated from specific PEG linkers on the \n\nsurface of PA 300 electrospun scaffolds before the elctrospinning process. To my \n\nknowledge, it was the first time that (bis)PEG-SVA and (bis)PEG-Alkyne were \n\nelectrospun together with a copolymer, leading to the fabrication of functional fibres \n\nwith NHS-esters and Alkynes on their surface, respectively. These incorporated \n\nfunctional groups are able to allow a selective immobilization of biomolecules onto the \n\nsurface of the electrospun fibres, avoiding unspecific adsorption and giving to the \n\nscaffold a high degree of specificity. In reality, this original concept can be adopted for \n\nmultiple tissue engineering applications since it present a simple and efficient \n\nmethodology to develop biofunctional electrospun scaffolds able to reproduce \n\ncomplex cell microenvironments.    \n\n\n\n92 \n \n\n9.
