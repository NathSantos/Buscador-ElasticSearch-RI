More specifi-\ncally, marine birds can be suitable bioindicators to assess the environmental conditions \nwhich characterize areas of interest. Their ecological features correspond immediately \nand intensely to environmental changes and food supplies, two parameters that are \nfundamental to assign them as bioindicators. Seabird species can be used also as indi-\ncators of fishery supplies since diet composition reflects prey availability and abundance \nfluctuation of prey appearance, which may also alter seabirds foraging strategy and \ntheir distribution pattern. Additionally, potential fluctuations of fish stocks  may cause \nsignificant population decline to seabirds, specifically to those which constitute general-\nist or specialist piscivorous species . As a consequence, seabirds is a taxonomically \nvaried group which constitutes  the most sensitive indicator between avifauna for moni-\ntoring environmental changes caused by natural forces and/or human activities . Infor-\nmation regarding fish stock changes and piscatorial activities such as fisheries overex-\nploitation and supply of discarded unsaleable bycatch can also be obtained by studying \nseabird behavior, but requires detailed knowledge of marine birds biology and their cor-\nrespondence to food supply changes. However it is important to highlight that data re-\nlated to the quantities and the composition of items discarded and potentially used as \nan additional food source for scavenging seabirds, are very limited in the Eastern \nMediterranean Sea. Moreover, seabirds constitute top marine predators, depended ex-\nclusively on aquatic environments where they face toxic risk by external contact, by in-\nhalation, and particularly by ingestion of food and water. Thus, long-lived seabirds may \nact as a bio-indicator for chemical pollution of different origin since they accumulate a \nwide range of chemical components and other forms of marine pollutants Consequently, \nthese species offer opportunities to detect and assess in a long term basis, toxicological \neffects of pollutants in marine ecosystems.  For example, one of their ecological fea-\ntures that could be affected by chemical pollution, is their population size that varies \nslightly between years. Juvenile growth rates, hatching  success, breeding success, and \nany behavior change during the incubation period, can be affected by toxic pollutant \n\nviii\n\n\n\ncontamination in the marine foraging areas used during breeding season. Many seabird \nspecies accumulate high concentrations of contaminants in their organism. Taking into \nconsideration that are in the highest place of trophic chain, seabirds are suitable \n\u201cscreens\u201d of pollutants that are being amplified via the trophic chain. Also, it has been \nalready proved that they are bioindicators of metal pollutants and used for the determi-\nnation of origin of mercury in marine trophic levels. Concentrations of metals are often \nreported for adult birds, but less often for chicks or fledglings. However, juveniles have \nbeen proposed as particularly useful indicators for pollution, as they concentrate metals \nduring a specific period of time and from local and definable foraging areas around \ncolony. The target species, namely Scopoli\u2019s Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) is a \npelagic, long lived, migratory seabird, with particularly high degree of site tenacity and \nmate fidelity. It is characterized as a highly vagrant species according to its pelagic and \nwide-ranging distribution. More specifically, the breeding sites of this species are locat-\ned in the Mediterranean basin whereas its wintering grounds are located in the pelagic \nand coastal equatorial areas of the eastern Atlantic. Its diet mainly includes pelagic and \nmesopelagic fishes, squids, crustaceans and occasionally zooplankton. These marine \norganisms can be found in shallow waters and near reefs, and constitute the most \ncommon prey caught in shallow waters or near the sea surface. Greece hosts a signifi-\ncant number of Scopoli\u2019s Shearwater colonies on uninhabited islets, spread mainly in \ncentral and southern Aegean Sea, southern and northern Ionian Sea and around Crete. \nOur study area, the Strofades Island complex (37\u00b0 15\u2019 N, 21\u00b0 00\u2019 E) is a remote group of \ntwo small low islets and several rocks, located in the southern Ionian Sea, 32 nm south \nof Zakynthos Island and 26 nm west of the Peloponnese. The two main islets (Stamfani \nand Arpyia) host the largest greek colony of the species (about 5,550 breeding pairs), \ncover an area of 4 km2 and constitute part of the National Marine Park of Zakynthos. \nData for metal contamination in seabirds originated from the Strofades Islands are bare-\nly exist. One of the aims of this study will be to provide baseline data for metal concen-\ntration levels in Scopoli\u2019s Shearwater collected in one of the biggest colonies in Greece \nfor comparative analyses of inter-specific and geographical differences in bioaccumula-\ntion.\n\nviii\n\n\n\nIn the present study levels of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), nickel \n(Ni), manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) were investigated as potential chemical stressors in \nthe blood of juveniles and adults Scopoli\u2019s Shearwaters in Strofades Island complex \ncolony, in Greece. Blood samples were collected from both juveniles and adult Scopoli\u2019s \nShearwaters individuals, during 7 different breeding seasons between 2007 and 2014. \nThe samples were collected in three sub-colonies from the western, southern and east-\nern part of the Stamfani Island, where fledglings and  breeders were captured by hand. \nAn amount of 0.2-0.5 ml per blood sample was collected using a heparinsed syringe \nand kept in eppendorf vials with ethyl alcohol as preservative. A total number of 238 \nsamples were collected, from which 182 were from juveniles. The process of metal \nanalysis of blood samples involved sample preparation, digestion and metal quantifica-\ntion. The digestion was performed using hot plate and the quantification of metal con-\ntent was performed by Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy. The accuracy \nof the method was verified by analyzing duplicates of the same amount of certified ref-\nerence material of blood serum. Blanks were also prepared with and acidified Milli-Q \nwater solution with 0.2% HNO3 and treated in the same way to check for any contami-\nnation. Statistical differences of metal concentrations were investigated along with rela-\ntionships with age, gender and nesting site. From toxic metals, cadmium (Cd) ranged \nbetween 0.01-0.02 ?g/g and lead (Pb) between 0.07-0.53 ?g/g, which were close to the \nrespective European standards. Concentrations of essential metals were generally \nclosed to basal levels, compared with other studies. Statistical analysis in juveniles and \nadults revealed that in relation to body mass there is no significant relationship between \nthe weight of individuals and metals.  All metals showed a significant difference with the \nyears. Statistical results indicate significant sexual differences for Cd, Co, Mn, Pb and \nZn for both juveniles and adults. Testing for correlation with nesting sites show signifi-\ncant differences for most of the tested metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn). Principal \nComponent Analysis (PCA) were used to detect the relationships between metal con-\ncentrations (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn), year, sex and site of for juvenile and adult \nbirds from Strofades Island colony. Results of PCA showed that they represent 34.82% \nof variance with PC1 representing (18.76%) and PC2 (16.05%). Metal levels tested do \n\nviii\n\n\n\nnot seem to have adverse effects on studied population, but diet analysis of the species \nwill be helpful towards the better understanding of metal uptake.\n\nviii\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nList of Figures 3\n\nList of Tables 4\n\n1.

General Ecology of Seabirds\n\nThe interaction between seabirds and marine environment occurs in different levels, \nfrom the lowest up to superior levels of the ecosystem. This is One of the appreciable \ncriteria that render them as  reliable candidates to monitor the conditions and health of \nthe marine environment. Generally, the ecology of these birds is well known, as well as \ntheir characteristics, population numbers and also their colonialist actions and \nreproductive processes, that constitutes a good occasion for monitoring high numbers \nof individuals (Piatt, 2007, Furness and Camphuysen, 1997).\u00a0\n\nMore specifically, marine birds can be suitable bioindicators to assess the \nenvironmental conditions and characterize the areas of interest. Their characteristics \ncorrespond immediately and intensely at environmental changes and food supplies, two \nparameters that are fundamental to assign them as bioindicators (Sponza et al., 2010). \nJuvenile growth rates, incubation success, birth success, nesting process and any \nbehavior changes during the incubation period, can be affected by toxic pollutant \ncontamination in the system. Seabird species can be used also as indicators of  fishery \nsupplies, by monitoring their searching behavior for preys, because they reflect the prey \navailability and abundance fluctuation of prey appearance, which influences their diet \nstrategies (Sponza et al., 2010). One of their characteristics that could be affected, is \ntheir population size that varies slightly between years.\n\nAs an example, disruption of reproduction can occur for European Shag (Phalacrocorax \naristotelis) in periods of constrained food supply and consequently it abstains from the \nreproductive process during those years (Furness and Camphuysen, 1997). This \ndisruption can also be observed in seabird populations, when fish stocks are deplete \n(Piatt, 2007). Additionally, potential fluctuations of fish stocks supplies, can change the \nnumber of seabirds (Velarde, 1994), because they have specific diet. As a rule, seabirds \nare the most sensitive indicators in-between bird species (Furness and Camphuysen, \n1997). Moreover, chemical components of the total trophic chain can be taken up from \nthe feeding of seabirds with various levels of the trophic chain. With observations on \nseabird behavior, their feeding preferences and the characteristics of their population, \n\nMASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !5\n\n\n\nwe can determine if the fish stocks have suffered any fluctuation (Piatt, 2007). \nInformation regarding fish stock changes and piscatorial activities can also be obtained, \nby studying seabird behavior (Furness and Camphuysen, 1997), but requires in detail \nknowledge of bird biology and their correspondence to food supply changes. As an \nexample, seabirds that \u201cscan\u201d for finding food, as the Yellow-legged gull (Larus \nmichahellis), feeds also on fishes that are rejected by the trawlers, and as a result, \npiscatorial activity on each area can be evaluated (Gonzalez - Solis, 2003, Ramos et al., \n2009). It is important to highlight that the data are related with the quantities and the \ncomposition of prey rejects are very limited in Mediterranean Sea. This method of study \ncan lead to a better understanding of way that fishery is affected.\n\nTaking into consideration that are in the highest place of trophic chain, seabirds are \nsuitable \u201cscreens\u201d of pollutants that are being amplified via the trophic chain (Furness \nand Camphuysen, 1997). Also, it has been already proved that they are bioindicators of \nmetal pollutants (eg. mercury) and used for the determination of origin of mercury in \nmarine trophic levels (Furness and Camphuysen, 1997). Seabird feathers are a useful \ntool to asses air pollution. Also by mercury ingestion they can easily locate the region \nwhere the pollution occurred, depended on the type of feathers (the different types of \nfeathers are connected with the seasons and movements of birds between reproductive \nand not reproductive period) (Furness and Camphuysen, 1997, Arcos et al., 2002, \nRamos et al., 2009). Also, monitoring other pollutants can be achieved with the analysis \nof their concentrations in eggshells.\n\n1.1 Scopoli\u2019s Shearwater\n\nThe mediterranean Scopoli\u2019s Shearwater, \nCalonectris diomedea diomedea (Figure 1), \nconstitutes one of the most characteristic types \nof fauna in the Mediterranean and Greek seas. It \nis a pelagic, long lived, monogamist, migratory \nseabird, with particularly high degree of site \ntenacity (Thibault et al.,\u00a0 1997). It has an \n\nMASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !6\n\nFigure 1: Adult Scopoli\u2019s Shearwater. Photo by the \nauthor\n\n\n\naerodynamic form with long\u00a0 and narrow wings.  On the upper side, it has a coffee \ncoloration and white on the under part. It\u2019s bill is powerful and yellowish. It\u2019s easy for \nsomeone to confuse them with a young gull but it can be distinguished during flight \nwhile the men gull strikes often it\u2019s wings and Scopoli\u2019s Shearwater can maneuvers \neasily between the waves without using them. In order to fly comfortably, Scopoli\u2019s \nShearwater the wind conditions should be higher than calm, which means 20-27 km/h. \nIn total calm conditions it has serious flying problems and strikes his wings to fly.\u00a0They \nfly usually low, close to water surface skulking the fishes that are frighten by the boat \npropellers.\n\nScopoli\u2019s Shearwater\u2019s diet is constituted from pelagic and mesopelagic fishes, squids, \ncrustaceans and occasionally zooplankton (Monteiro et al 1996). These and other small \nfishes that are found in shallow waters and near reefs, are the most common prey and \nthey are caught when they are found in shallow waters or near the sea surface \n(Granadeiro et al., 1998).\n\nMASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !7\n\nFigure 2: Chart of distribution and size of Scopoli\u2019s Shearwater colonies in Aegean and Ionian Sea. Birdlife \nInternational 2004, Handrinos &amp; Akriotis 1997, Ristow et al. 1991, Karris et al. 2010\n\n\n\nAccording to Cramp and Simmons (1977) and Belda and S\u00e1nchez (2001), Scopoli\u2019s \nShearwater prey on the day but also in the night or at dawn as in Balearic Islands. In \nStrofades Islands, Karris et al. (2009 and 2010), found that  during the nightly hours \n(00:00 \u2013 05:00am) the Shearwaters spend most of their time searching for preys, while \nthe morning hours up to midday spend the bigger part for their movings. It was found \nthat a marked Shearwater from Strofades Islands colony, covered a distance of 142,4 \nkm and an area of 580 km2 within four days, for prey searching (Karris et al., 2010). \nStudies concluded that, shearwaters can use for their food search an extensive region if \nthe fish stocks are limited close to their colony (Mougin and Jouanin 1977, Karris et al.,\n2010).\u00a0\n\nIn Greece, Shearwaters are nesting in islands, mainly in central and southern Aegean \nSea, southern Ionian Sea and around Crete. Practically, is possible to see them \neverywhere, because they daily cover long distances and fly far away from their \ncolonies. The European population of Shearwaters is estimated in 270,000 - 290,000 \nbreeding pairs that correspond to 810,000 - 870,000 individuals, by which 234,500 - \n243,500 are breeding in Atlantic Ocean and 35,000 - 55,000 in Mediterranean Sea \n(BirdLife International 2004a). A percentage of 75 - 94% of world distribution of the \nspecies is located in European territory, therefore an initial estimate of world population \nof the species is  approximately 900,000 - 1.200,000 individuals. Mediterranean \ncolonies are usually found in inhabited rocky islands and are relatively small (Ristow et \nal., 1991). Greek population is estimated in 4,400 - 5,000 pairs distributed between 29 \ncolonies in Aegean Sea and Ionian Sea (Figure 2) (Birdlife International 2004, \nHandrinos and Akriotis 1997). New data from Strofades Islands colony increased the \nGreek population to 8,400 - 10,000 pairs, while only the Strofades Islands colony \nnumbers 5,000 - 6,000 pairs and is the biggest colony of Mediterranean Sea (Karris et \nal., 2010).\u00a0\n\nShearwater is a migratory species. Arrives in Mediterranean Sea on March and leaves \non October. Migrates in long distances and most of the individuals cover distances \nbetween 15.000 and 35.000 km annually, between two reproductive periods (Gonz\u00e1lez-\nSol\u00eds et al., 2007). The migration take place in regions southern from Equator, during \n\nMASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !8\n\n\n\nthe winter period of northern hemisphere. Shearwaters travel using the wind forces, \nsaving great amount of energy (Gonz\u00e1lez-Sol\u00eds et al., 2007). They spend on average \n80\u00b117 days, in winter regions and 19\u00b110 and 23\u00b17 days for their travel in fall and in \nspring respectively, time that is equivalent with an important percentage of their annual \ncycle. Two of the greatest Shearwater populations, overwinter following the souther \nBrazil and Benguela currents, an important percentage (29%) of the Mediterranean \npopulation (Gonz\u00e1lez-Sol\u00eds et al., 2007).\n\nScopoli\u2019s Shearwater is a socially \nmonogamic species. Adults (> 5 years) \nvisit the land only in order to breed in \nisolated islands, sometimes in dense \ncolonies but more often in smaller and \nscattered groups. The age of an \nimportant percentage species population \nexceeds 20 years according to banding \n(marked birds using a unique numbered \nmetal ring) bird trapped in Crete Island, \nindicate that female individuals live more \nthan males (Ristow et al., 1991, Ristow et \nal., 1992). They are strictly nocturnal \nbirds in their colonies, with the exception \nof the Selvagem Grande colony, where \nthey come on land a few hours before \nsunset (Zino 1971). Also they are nesting \nin relatively spacious cavities, without any \ntype of defense or natural protection from \npredators (Catry et al., 2006). Before the \n\nbreeding period, males play an important role of securing the nest and spending more \ntime keeping it safe (Jouanin et al., 2001), while on the other hand female take the \nresponsibility of the egg production. During the incubation period both males and \nfemales spend the same time during the process by changing shifts (Figure 3). The \n\nMASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !9\n\nFigure 3: Pair of Scopoli\u2019s Shearwaters in the nest, during \n\nFigure 4: Scopoli\u2019s Shearwater chick. Photo by the author\n\n\n\ncomplete fledge of the nestlings begins from 8 - 9 of October and lasts until the last \nweek of the same month (Round and Swann 1977), thus the fledging period lasts 83 - \n98 days and is relatively short for such size of seabird. The reproductive period begins \nin March, with the return of adults from the wintering areas in central and southern \nAtlantic (Ristow et al., 2000, Camphuysen and Van der Meer 2001) to the breeding \ncolonies. \n\nThe reproductive success is related with the egg size. Bigger eggs produce nestlings \nand complete fledgling juveniles (Figure 4) more frequent than that the small eggs \n(Mougin 1998, Ramos et al., 1997). This shows that a connection exists between \nreproductive characteristics and the physical condition of parents (Ramos et al., 2003). \nOther important characteristic is the reproductive success it is that most casualties are \ntaking place during the egg phase, with fledge success be always much higher than the \nhatching success (Ramos et al., 2003). At the end of May, females gives birth an egg \nwhich fledges for roughly 52 days. The chick hatches in middle of July and fledging until \nthe end of October when the migration period starts for the wintering areas. The first \nreturn of the juveniles in the colony becomes after 4 - 5 years.\n\nThe reproduction habitat is the basic parameter that determines the reproductive \nsuccess. The intraspecific competition for the nesting areas is intense in Shearwaters, \nas the high levels of daily presence in the nests show, as well as the territory behavior \nat the period of three months before spawning (Monteiro et al., 1996). The importance \nof maintenance the nesting place and it\u2019s defense, is indicated by the general \nbad\u00a0physical condition of adult birds (as it appears from their body mass) in the period \nbefore spawning, something that is usual in species that maintain the same place of \nnesting for years (Monteiro et al., 1996).\n\n1.2 Species Threats\n\nIn European level, the species are included in the Part I of European Directive 79/409 \nfor the protection of wild birds, in Part II on Bern Convention on the conservation of \nEuropean wildlife and natural habitats, while it was also considered as \u201cVulnerable\u201d \n\nMASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !10\n\n\n\naccording to European threat regime (BirdLife International 2004a). Globally, the \nspecies is reported of IUCN  as LC  (Least Concern).1 2\n\nIn national level Shearwater has not been counted in the recent publication of Greek   \n\u201cRed Book\u201d  of species because is still maintains rather good populations or even have 3\n\nwide distribution in Greek area and thus they do not appear at the present moment to \nface problems of extinction (Legakis and Maragkou 2009).\n\nAnselme and Durand (2012) categorized the basic threats for the species in two main \nlevels. That ones that act outside the\u00a0 reproductive areas (colonies) and the in situ \nthreats: In the first category we have those where they have direct or indirect cross-\ncorrelation with piscatorial activities that are taking place in the feeding areas and \nphenomena that are related with climatic changes and pollution cases in the marine \necosystem (Stewart et al., 1997). The second category refers to the in situ threats, that \noccur in the species colony. The major predators in land are the European wild cats \n(Felix silvestris), Black rats (Rattus rattus), European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) \nand European pine martens (Martes martes). Also predating pressure can be applied to \neggs, nestlings and also in adults by other bird species such as the Yellow - legged gull \n(Larus michahellis) and the Eurasian eagle - owl (Bubo bubo) and Peregrines (Falco \nperegrinus). Notable are also the effects of anthropogenic activities such as public \nnuisance, the uncontrolled touristic activity and the lights that turned on during evening \nhours. These have deterrent effects on the adults to visit their nests. Finally, recent \nstudies (Karris et al., 2013, Petrella 2011) that took place in Strofades Islands, showed \nthat a notable threat is the accidental entrapment (by-catch) of Scopoli\u2019s Shearwaters in \npiscatorial tools, such as trawl line and driftnet.\n\n IUCN: International Union for Conservation of Nature1\n\n LC: In low risk for extinction and is not considered on a red listed category by the IUCN2\n\n Red Book of Species: Red Data Book of International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Study area of Strofades Island complex\n\nStrofades (37\u00b015'10.8\"N 21\u00b000\u201924.2\u201dE) are a complex of two small islands in the ionian \nSea, in Greece. They are located between the southern part of Zakynthos Island and \nthe western coasts of Peloponnese (Figure 5). They have an extent of 2,6 km2. The \nbigger and southerner of the two islands is named Stamfani. It is a rocky island with \nlength about 1 km. The smaller one is called Arpyia. The islands are 27 nautical miles \nfrom the southern point of Zakynthos Island and 28 nautical miles from the coasts of \nPeloponnese.\n\nIn the highest part of western nesting site is found a light house that was builded during \n20th century and was handled by a lighthouse keeper. Back in time, the islands were  \ndrowned in vegetation and the monks that where resided, in order to survive, used the \n2/3 of Stamfani Island as farms. They were also breeding ruminant mammals as a food \nsource.\n\nStrofades Islands are enlisted in the Important Bird Areas  inventory (IBA) and they 4\nhave been included in the Corine program as important biotopes and constituting a part \n\n Important Bird Area (IBA): Area identified using an internationally agreed set of criteria as being globally important 4\nfor the conservation of bird populations\n\nMASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !12\n\nFigure 5: Strofades Island complex location, Southern Ionian Sea, Greece. Map by the author\n\n\n\nof the National Marine Park of Zakynthos Island. These two small islands, that are \nlocated in Ionian Sea, as two small dots, and are integral part of the Greek natural and \ncultural legacy with special interest and needs of management and environmental \nprotection.\nThe island ecosystem is very rich in species diversity. This can be reflected by the \ndifferent herpetofauna species, such as Lizards (Algyroides moreoticuspoy), Cat snakes \n(Telescopus\u00a0 fallax) and species that are in protection, such as Sea turtles (Caretta \ncaretta), Mediterranean seals (Monachus monachus) and other marine mammals.\nStrofades Islands have a very big importance on bird migration. In spring they stop for \nresting thousands of migratory birds that come from Africa. They begin to arrive the \nmost interesting birds of Greek avifauna such us the European Bee-eater (Merops \napiaster), Hoopoe (Upupa epops), Red-backed Shrike (Lanius collurio) and \nNightingales. Until today they have been observed more than 120 species of birds, \nbased on bird banding  projects that taking place every Spring in Stamfani island.5\n\nIf somebody in any case wanted to give at an avifauna species symbolic value for \nStrofades Islands, this should be the Scopoli\u2019s Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), \nwhich makes it\u2019s nests under dense bushy vegetation near the coasts.\nEndemically, Stamfani Island is in the same category as Zakynthos and Cefalonia \nislands. Also, the islands are connected phytogeographical with Peloponnese. The \nforest of Strofades Islands, located in Stamfani island, is unique in Greece and perhaps \nin all Mediterranean Sea. The forestial ecosystem characterized by various bushy \nsclerophyllous species as Oaks (Quercus coccifera), Shrubs (Pistacia lentiscus) and \nolive trees. Is dense in many points and sometimes the sun can not even reach the \nground. Arpyia island is covered by maquis vegetation covered by Pistacia bushes, \nMyrtles and Olive trees. Also, more than 300 species of plants are located in the \nislands, such as the uncommon orchid of Ionian Islands (Serapias ionica).\n\n3. Metals and Seabirds\n\nSeabirds are widely used to monitor trace element levels due to their wide distribution \nand high position in the food web (Piatt et al. 2007). There is evidence that metal \nconcentration levels are increasing in some areas due to human activities (Nriagu 1988; \nSlemr and Langer 1992; Thompson et al., 1992). Toxic metals, even at relatively low \nlevels, are known to accumulate in many marine animals, including seabirds, although \n\n Bird Banding: Marking birds by applying a metal ring on their tarsus, with a unique number5\n\nMASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !13\n\n\n\nthey have no known biological function (Thompson 1990).From both a biomonitoring \nand toxicological viewpoint it is important to understand the physiological processes and \ndynamics of nonessential metals in the organs and tissues of seabirds (Stewart et al., \n1996).\n\nTable 1 presents combined results from various studies, in support of creating the \nbaseline knowledge about the metal concentrations for seabird species. This \ninformation will be used as a guideline for an estimation of metal concentrations in \ndifferent tissues in comparison to the metal concentrations from the derived results of \nthe blood analysis. All the collected information are referring to metal concentrations \nmean values per grams (dry tissue) or deciliter.\n\nConcentrations of metals are often reported for adult birds, but less often for chicks or \nfledglings (Walsh 1990). However, juveniles have been proposed as particularly useful \nindicators for pollution, as they concentrate metals during a specific period of time (i.e. \nhatching to fledging) and from a local and definable foraging area (Walsh 1990). In \naddition, only limited data exist concerning metal levels in seabirds from the Strofades \nIsland complex area. One of the aims of this study will be to provide baseline data for \nmetal concentration levels in Scopoli\u2019s Shearwater collected in one of the biggest \ncolonies in Greece for comparative analyses of inter-specific and geographical \ndifferences in bioaccumulation.\n\nLead (Pb)\n\nIs one of the toxic metals that can be found and affect the biological processes of the \nspecies, which no any known biological requirement in avian species. Pb can be found \nin the Earth\u2019s crust, but in relatively low concentrations. During the Industrial Revolution, \nthe use of Pb in many different cases, such as batteries, fossil fuels and smelters, \nresulted the disturbance of Pb-biogeochemical cycle (Eisler 1988, Von Schirnding and \nFuggle 1996, de Villiers et al., 2010). Environmental broadcasting of Pb residues poses \na hazard for wildlife species (Eisler 1988, Franson and Pain 2011). Birds can be \ncontaminated by Pb by the inhalation and ingestion and is possible to have particles of \nPb on the feathers, as are spending most of their lives at the breeding grounds \n\nMASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !14\n\n\n\n(Gonzalez-Solis et al., 2007). The deposition of contaminants may be particularly \nimportant in procellariiform species, because they show long breeding seasons and \nrelatively short wintering periods (Thompson et al., 1999, Monteiro et al., 1996). The \neffects of Pb in avian species can damage the hematopoietic system and also the \nvascular, nervous, renal, or reproductive system (Kendall and Scanlon 1982, Lumeij \n1985, Burger and Gochfeld 1985, Scheuhammer 1987, Blus et al., 1991, Bakalli et al., \n1995, Jose Rodriguez et al., 2010). Franson and Pain in a study of 2011, divided Pb \nexposure and effects in four different levels. The background level, subclinical level, \nclinical level and severe clinical level. Background exposure conferring to \nconcentrations in wider environments far away from emission sources.

Subclinical levels can cause \nphysiological effects but can not reduce the normal biological functions (Franson and \nPain 2011).\n\nCadmium (Cd)\n\nCadmium (Cd) is also a toxic metal with no known biological requirement in birds. \nDuring the Industrial Revolution, anthropogenic activities (smelters, fossil fuel uses, \nfertilizers, production of batteries and plastics) altered the natural distribution of Cd \n(Eisler 1985, De Villiers et al., 2010). Cd is less volatile than Pb, so atmospheric \ntransport is not of great concern. Fluvial transport is more important and sets a hazard \nto aquatic wildlife species (Eisler 1985, Furness 1996, Wayland and Scheuhammer \n2011). Birds can easily contaminated with Cd by ingestion, than inhalation, and it is also \npossible to have particles on the feathers (Eisler 1985, Furness 1996). \n\nThere are other metals that can be found and monitored in birds, such as Copper (Cu), \nChromium (Cr), Cobalt (Co), Nickel (Ni), Manganese (Mn) and Zinc (Zn).These are \nessential elements, but may also become toxic, if present in excessively high \nconcentrations, as they are accumulated in tissues (Elliott and Scheuhammer, 1997). \nMetal particles can enter on each organism by digestion and transported through the \nfood chain. Studies show that seabirds can increase their body metal concentrations \nlevels by digesting specific pelagic fish species (Karris et al., 2016).\n\nThis study examines metals, with no any biological requirement in seabird organisms, \nthat can be toxic in low concentrations (Pb, Cd) and essential  metals that can be toxic if \npresent high concentrations (Cu, Cr, Co, Ni, Mn and Zn). All the previously mentioned, \ncan be transported through the trophic levels and depending their concentration levels, \nto evaluate the environmental state.\n\nMany studies resulted in that blood can be used to examine recent exposure to metals \nin humans and birds (Subramanian and Meranger 1981, Garc\u00e1- Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 1996, \nTirelli et al., 1996, Benito et al., 1999, Van Wyk et al., 2001, Wayland et al., 2001, \nWilson et al., 2004, Bazzi et al., 2008). In birds, Pb and Cd are absorbed into the \nbloodstream and quickly end up into soft tissues including liver, kidney, bone, and \n\nMASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !16\n\n\n\ngrowing feathers. Also, an exposure by ingestion can give elevated levels in tissues and \nblood (Samuel et al., 1992, Franson and Pain 2011, Wayland and Scheuhammer 2011). \nIn 2001 Van Wyk and et al, found similar mean Pb concentrations between blood, brain, \nliver and muscle tissue, by examining African vultures. They concluded that blood can \nbe a trustworthy indicator of body charge by metals. Blood sampling can not cause \ndeath and it\u2019s possible to be applied on live animals. It has to be noted that blood \nsampling is not affecting any of the bird\u2019s vital functions and is not causing any damage \nto its organs. Feathers can be contaminated by external sources, unlike blood sampling. \nThese are the reasons why blood sampling is a successful method to monitor toxic \nmetals in species.\n\n4. Material and Methods\n\n4.1 Field Sampling\n\nJuvenile and adult Scopoli\u2019s Shearwaters \nwere sampled between 2007 and 2014 \nfrom the breeding colony of Strofades \nIslands in southern Ionian Sea, Greece. \nThe species colony at the study area \nhosts about 5,500 breeding pairs (Karris \net al. 2017) and constitutes the largest \nc o l o n y i n e a s t e r n M e d i t e r r a n e a n . \n\nSampling took place at Stamfani Island \nduring the end of the fledging period (end of September-mid of October) in order to \nsample fledglings as well as adults. Capturing burrowing seabirds is a challenging task. \nThey attack in order to defend their nests. Their nests are under boulders and in very \ndeep holes, so a hand made catch pole was the best solution. Blood samples were \ncollected in three sub-colonies from the western, southern and eastern part of the island \n\nMASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !17\n\nFigure 6: Position of the sampled nests of Stamfani \nIsland perimeter. Map by D. Portolou\n\n\n\n(Figure 6), where fledglings, breeders and prospectors were captured by hand. \nPermissions for the fieldwork were provided by the local authorities e.g. management \nbody of National Marine Park of Zakynthos, National Coastguard Authorities and \nMetropolis of Zakynthos. \n\nAt a first stage, morphometric and weight data were collected per individual. Blood \nsampling was followed by using the main wing vein, while the shearwater was securely \nheld. The handler had to extent the wing to expose the main vein for bleeding by the \nsampler. An amount of 0.2-0.5 ml per blood sample was collected using a heparinsed \nsyringe and kept in eppendorf vials (1.5 ml) with ethyl alcohol as preservative. A total \nnumber of 238 samples were collected, from which 182 were from juveniles. After each \nsampling, shearwaters were placed back in their nests. The collected samples were \nplaced in boxes with ice and transported at -8Co to the laboratory and stored at -20Co in \nthe lab of TEI of Ionian Islands. In September 2016 they were transported to the \nUniversity of Algarve in the same conditions until further analysis. \n\n4.2 Preparation of samples and laboratory analysis\nThe process of metal analysis of blood samples involved sample preparation, digestion \nand metal quantification. The digestion was performed using hot plate and the \nquantification of metal content was performed by Graphite furnace atomic absorption \nspectroscopy for the metals: Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and flame atomic adsorption \nspectroscopy for Zn.\nThe analysis of metals was performed at the chemical laboratory (LaQ) in the University \nof Algarve.\n\n4.2.1 Preparation and acid digestion of samples\n?\n\nThe total amount of blood samples were transferred into polypropylene digestion tubes \n(50 ml) previously dried at 40 Co for 24h until constant weight and the weight noted. The \ntubes containing the blood samples were then placed in a hot plate (set at 40 Co for 45 \n\nMASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !18\n\n\n\nminutes, to avoid destroying any bounds of blood \nproteins) to evaporate ethyl alcohol (that was used for \nfield preservation  and the dry weight of the blood \nsamples were noted. Then 1 mL of concentrated nitric \nacid (HNO3) p.a. was added to each sample that were \n\ndigested at 60 Co for more than one hour (Figure 7).\n\n4.2.2 Quantification \n\nAfter the digestion of samples, tubes were diluted up to a \ntotal volume of 5 ml by adding 0.2% nitric acid solution \n(HNO3  - Milli Q Water). 44 samples were handled at each \ntime. The accuracy of the method was verified by \nanalyzing duplicates of the same amount of certified \nreference material of blood serum (SeronormTM Trace \nElements Whole Blood L-1, Sero). Blanks were also \n\nprepared with and acidified Milli-Q water solution with \n0.2% nitric acid (HNO3) and treated in the same way \nto check for any contamination.. Thereafter, 1ml of \neach sample was transferred trace metal free tubes \nfor using graphite furnace atomic absorption \nspectroscopy (AAnalyst 800 - THGA Furnace) \n(Figure 8). Blanks that were placed between every \n10 samples and the detection limit of each metal \nwas calculated from the instrument detection limit \n(IDL: Cd 0.0116?g/l, Co 0.2416 ?g/l, Cr 0.1996?g/l, \n\nCu 0.2430?g/l, Mn 0.0585?g/l, Ni 0.2098?g/l, Pb \n0.3975?g/l, Zn 2.7820?g/l). To calculate metal concentration a calibration curve using \ncommercial standard of metals for atomic absorption measurements (Merck CertiPUR \nInorganic Mixes) was used. The Analytik Jena nov AA 350 flame atomic adsorption \n\nMASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !19\n\nFigure 7: Digesting the samples at 60 Co\n\n Figure 8: Graphite furnace atomic \nabsorption spectroscopy method\n\nF i g u r e 9 : F l a m e a t o m i c a d s o r p t i o n \nspectroscopy to determine Zn concentrations\n\n\n\nspectroscopy was used for the analysis of Zn (Figure 9), using internal standards at the \nbeginning and the end of the procedure. \n\n4.3 Statistical Analysis\n?\n\nThe statistical analyses of the data were conducted using SPSS statistical package \n(IBM Company, Chicago, IL, USA) and Gretl statistical software. Means, standard \ndeviations, medians, and ranges of metal concentrations in blood samples were \ncalculated per sub-colony and per breeding year. All data were checked for normal \ndistribution and if necessary, transformed using logarithm scale to obtain normal \ndistribution. More specifically we used a set of four tests (Doornik-Hansen, Shapiro-\nWilk, Lilliefors and Jarque-Bera) so as to check normality of metal concentrations in \ntotal as well as per breeding season, and to proceed (if this was necessary) to log-\ntransformation of data to meet model requirements.  Additionally, pairwise correlation \ncoefficients (Pearson\u2019s product-moment correlation) was employed in order to obtain \nrelevant correlation matrix and identify possible relationships between selected \nvariables. One-way ANOVA tests were used to determine significant differences of metal \nconcentrations between sub-colonies and breeding years. Concentrations of the metals \nwere also compared between different age classes and genders. A Principal \nComponent Analysis was also used to relate metal concentration patterns in the blood \nsamples from different sub-colonies.

More specific, analysis of variance (one way \nANOVA) indicated that Cd show a significant difference on 2008 (Figure 10 - I) (one way \nANOVA, p&lt;0.05). The different racial groups present differentiation in levels in Co for \nthe studied years (Figure 10 - K): F(6,76)=5.2341, p&lt;0.05). 2008 was the year that Co \nshowed a significant difference (p&lt;0.05). Cr, like cobalt, present different levels for the \nstudied years: F(6,184)=10.711, p&lt;0.05 and showed also a significant difference for \n2008 (Figure 10 - L). The same for Cu (Figure 10 - M), were present significant different \nlevels for the years: F(6,179)=13.141, p&lt;0.05 and resulted a significant difference for \n2008 (p&lt;0.05). The same statistical test resulted significant differences for Mn: \n(F(6,181)=4.3671, p&lt;0.05) (Figure 10 - N) with the highest levels on 2008, 2012 and \n2014.

Results of PCA showed that they \nrepresent 34.82% of variance with PC1 representing (18.76%) and PC2 (16.05%). \nFigure 13, shows the distribution of metal levels, according to the two principal \ncomponents (Table 4 explains the symbols that appear on Figure 13). PC1 (18.76%), \nwhich is the most important component, indicates a negative relationship between Pb \nand Cr with the rest of the metals. PC2 (16.05%) indicates that the distribution of Cd \nand Zn is opposite (in the negative part of PC2) to Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni and Pb. \nFurthermore, PC1 relates strongly with Mn (r=0.554) and Zn (r=0.420) (Table A.1 in \nAnnex) and PC2 with Cr (r=0.599) (Table A.1 in Annex). PCA indicated that in 2007, Zn \nand Co had negative distribution, based on PC1 (38.90%) and Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, and \nPb have a positive distribution, opposite to Co and Zn. The non-essential metals are \nnegatively related with Zn and Co, with a small differentiation with the rest of the metals \n(see A1 in Annex). In most of the individuals Zn and Co are the dominant metals and the \ndistribution of these metals is negatively related with the levels of the rest metals. Based \non the second principal component (17.46%), the essential metals (Zn, Co, Ni and Mn) \nare negatively correlated with the non-essential metals (Pb, Cd).\nIn 2008, based on the PC1 (19.96%), Pb and Cr have a negative relationship with the \nrest of the metals. The PC2 (16.80%) describes the negatively relationship of Cu and \nCo with Pb, Cr, Zn, Mn and Cd (see A2 in Annex). Also PC2 describes the differences \nbetween age in which Juveniles had highest relationship with Cu and Co, than adults.\nFor the year 2009, the results from PC1 (33.23%) show that the non-essential metals \n(Pb and Cd) have a negative relationship with the rest of the metals. Juveniles had \nhigher correlation of Pb and Cd, based on PC1, than adults. Also male individuals from \nWestern part of the island had highest relationship with Pb. On the other hand, males \nand females are highly related with Ni, Cr, Co, Cu (see A3 in Annex). The results from \nPC2 (20.80%) show a high correlation of Cd and Mn. For Zn, Co and Co the \nrelationship was very small.  Cu and Pb levels were highly related with PC2 and \nnegatively related with Cd and Mn (A3 in Annex).\n\nMASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !28\n\n\n\nPC1 (44.48%) for 2010, shows that Zn and Cd levels are opposite with the rest of the \ntested metals. Generally from all the individuals, Zn and Cd showed to have the highest \nresponse. Juveniles were highly related with Zn and Cd, based on PC1, than with adults \n(see A4 in Annex). PC2 (19.01%) show that Mn, Cu and Cr had lower relationships and \nopposite of Zn and Cd. On PC2 the relationship with Ni, Co and Pb were higher.\nIn 2011 Zn was the only metal that had a negative relationship compared with the other \nmetals, based on PC1 (34.14%). Juveniles had higher relationship with Zn and Cu than \nadults. Females from western and southern area were related more with Zn (see A5 in \nAnnex). PC2 (18.39%) resulted a very small relationship between Cr, Cu, Zn and Mn. \nHigher relationships were with Cd, Co (positive related) and Ni, Pd (negative related)\n2012 was the year with the least of differentiation based on PC1 (40.38%). Most of the \njuveniles did not show any relationship with the metals. Females were the individuals \nwith the highest relationship with all the metals (see A6 in Annex). PC2 (16.12%) \nresulted in a negative and strong relationship between Cr, Cu, Pb and positive \nrelationship with Zn and Co. Cd, Ni and Mn had lower relationship with PC2.\nFinally, for 2014, PC1 (23.98%) resulted that Pb and Cd were stronger related with each \nother and negatively related with Cu, Mn and Zn. The rest of the metals (essential \nmetals) were positively related and opposite of the non-essential metals., Ni and Cr had \ndifferent response with the rest of the metals. Correlations between Zn, Co and Mn \nwere higher in juveniles. Females from the western part of the island were related with \nthe non- essential metals and Cr (see A7 in Annex). In PC2 (21.50%), only Cr has an \nopposite relationship with the other metals.\n\nMASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !29\n\n\n\nMASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !30\n\nFigure 13: Result of principal component analysis. xx\u2019 axis shows component 1 and yy\u2019 axis shows component 2.

Discussion\n\nMarine birds as top consumers are particularly vulnerable by spatially and temporally \ndefined threats such as marine pollution. They are exposed to a wide range of \nchemicals and other forms of marine pollution because they depend exclusively on the \nmarine environment where they face toxic risk by external contact, inhalation, and \nparticularly ingestion of food and water. \nScopoli\u2019s shearwater is a long-lived migratory pelagic Procellariiform species with high \nrates of nest tenacity and mate fidelity, and exploits persistent productive marine areas. \nIt is a surface feeder, consuming pelagic fish mainly, at least during incubation and the \nchick-rearing period (Af\u00e1n et al. 2014). Recent findings have shown that this seabird \nadopts a dual strategy, feeding on epipelagic shelf prey in shallow waters during short \ntrips and on oceanic prey items, normally associated with different water masses, during \nlong trips (Cecere et al. 2013).  Shearwaters feed on a range of different fish but also on \nspecific cephalopods such as European squids (Alonso et al. 2012, Neves et al. 2012). \nAccording on the results of Karris et al. (2015), bottom trawler fishery operations in the \nstudy area provide significant amounts of benthopelagic prey species to shearwaters \nduring their pre-laying period in spring. This alternative food supply can be \ncharacterized as normally unavailable due to the foraging ecology of Scopoli\u2019s \nshearwater and, as a consequence, may affect the population dynamics of local \ncolonies and specifically the Strofades population. Analysis of metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, \nMn, Ni, Pb, Zn) in the blood (Table 3) showed that concentrations were in general lower \ncompared with metal levels in blood of other similar seabird species (Table 1). No \nsignificant relationship was detected between the weight of individuals and  metal levels \n(correlation matrix with the total amount of samples), for adult and juveniles, which \nallowed us to compare metals levels with years, age of the birds and breeding site. This \nis in contrast with other studies on Shearwaters (Chihiro et al. 2017) were a strong \ncorrelation of body weight with cadmium was found. This was the result that chicks \nmainly eat small fish and later change their diet to squids or to other organisms \ncontaining high Cd levels so they accumulate more of this metal, because of bigger \n\nMASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !31\n\n\n\nprey. According with recent studies for morphometrics and sex dimorphism on Scopoli\u2019s \nShearwater on Strofades colony (Karris et al. 2013), the morphometrics is not changing \nfrom juveniles to adults. Combining the information of these two studies we can assume \nthat Scopoli\u2019s Shearwaters does not change their diet as they grow and they eat the \nsame species of fishes and squids.\n \nPCA analysis resulted A positive relationship of Cd and Zn, was observed supported by \nPCA analysis (Figure 13) which was consistent with previous reports (Chihiro et al. \n2017). These metals are expected to interact with a detoxification system, such as \nmetallothionein (MT), a low molecular weight cysteine-rich protein involved in the \nhomeostasis of essential metals, such as Zn. The synthesis of MT can be induced by \nseveral metals, such as Cd, Zn and Cu. Zn is essential for the synthesis of MT. When \nCd is taken up, Zn in MT is replaced with Cd to achieve detoxification. It was reported \nthat Cd and MT concentrations are positively related in many seabirds (Eliot et al. 1992; \nStewart et al. 1996). High accumulation of Cd induces the synthesis of.\nAccording to the present results (Table 3), blood levels of cadmium in Scopoli\u2019s \nShearwater are similar to levels from other blood seabird species. Concentrations of \ncadmium varied in from 0.01-0.02 ?g/g, compared with other seabirds such as in Marion \nIsland, South Africa (0.04 ?g/g - 0.304 ?g/g) (Summers et al. 2014). However, cadmium \nconcentrations on Strofades colony were found in low values if we compare with \nmaximum levels set out by the European community, for foodstuff contaminants (0.1 \nmg/g) (European Commission Regulation, 2006). Differences in cadmium levels, \ncompared with other studies, can be related with various factors such as the region,\u00a0the \nproductivity of the marine ecosystem, the season of sampling, but also the use of \ndifferent analytical processes used, the sampling method and also the environmental \ncontamination (Galitsopoulou, 2014).\nAnother aspect of the current study was the variation of metal levels throughout different \nbreeding seasons. Cadmium concentrations were higher in 2008, in relation with other \nyears (Figure 1). Sex differentiation of cadmium concentrations were also detected. The \nmales had higher cadmium concentrations, in relation with females, for both juveniles \nand adults and juvenile birds showed significant higher cadmium levels than adults \n\nMASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !32\n\n\n\n(Figure 2A. 11A) indicating that cadmium accumulation depends on the age and gender. \nThere is a possibility that the food are different between males and females, and it \ncauses the differences of metal accumulation (Chihiro et al. 2017). Pawel et al (2000) \nshowed that juvenile Black-headed Gulls had always higher cadmium levels compared \nwith adults. Zn levels  were also significantly higher (Figure 11 - H\u2019) in juveniles. \nThe western part of Strofades Island had higher cadmium concentrations (Figure 12 - \nA). This may be the result of different foraging distribution pattern between birds that \nbreed in different sub areas of Stamfani Island, but this has to be proved by using \nremote sensing techniques on adult birds that breed in the western part that seem to \nuse different feeding areas than the birds of southern part.\nThe number of samples was relatively similar, except from the Eastern region, where \nthe ground morphology difficult the sampling process and the amount of samples were \nvery small and were not taken into account on the data analysis. According to previous \nstudies,\u00a0in the Adriatic sea no relation between cadmium levels and the sampling area \nwas detected (Desideri et al., 2010). In contrast Pastor et al. (1994) in western \nMediterranean, found that cadmium concentration  was influenced by foraging area and \nthat increased concentrations were observed in coastal piscatorial areas with significant \nindustrial activity and assembled urban population. Different factors that may influence \nmetal concentrations in feeding areas, like the existence of river flows and also \nincidents of direct industrial rejections within urban waste, without any actions of correct \nenvironmental management (Topcuo?lu et al., 2002). Another important parameter that \ncan have an impact on the metal concentrations is the season of foraging activity by the \nadults-breeders. Food provision to nestlings begins from mid July just after egg \nhatching, up to few days before fledgling (late September-early October).\nThe months with increased cadmium concentrations in ichthyofauna in Eastern \nMediterranean are September, October and November (Galitsopoulou, 2014). The \neffect of seasonal foraging activity in the accumulation of cadmium is attributed, mainly \non physiologic differentiations of fish catches, throughout year (\u00d6zden, 2013.\nThere is a substantial body of literature describing the effects of lead contamination on \nseabird behavior and physiology (Burger and Gochfeld 2000). Lead is an anthropogenic \n\nMASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !33\n\n\n\ncontaminant that has no biological function and can be transported by great distances \natmospherically (Nriagu 1989 and Burger 1993).\nConcentrations of lead in the blood of the birds range between 0.07-0.53 ?g/g, \ncomparatively with other seabird species colonies, such as in Marion Island (0.034 ?g/g \n- 0.138 ?g/g) (Summers et al. 2014). The levels of lead concentration were in some \ncases higher than maximum levels set out by the European community, for foodstuff \ncontaminants (0.3 mg/g) (European Commission Regulation, 2006), that are expressed \nin Table 3 on results. Levels from other studies of different marine species in the same \nregion (Galitsopoulou, 2014) show that Pb levels didn\u2019t exceed 0.297 ?g/g of sample. It \nis a possibility for an indication for contamination.\nLead concentrations were higher than cadmium.\u00a0This observation is in agreement with \nprevious results of related seabirds spread around different colonies, where lead \nconcentrations showed significant differences in comparison with\u00a0cadmium (Summers et \nal.2014, Bond et al., 2010). Statistical analysis indicate significant higher levels of lead \nfor the breeding season of 2008. In contrast with cadmium concentration, lead was \nhigher in birds from the southern sector. This may be explained by possible difference in \nforaging distribution pattern in comparison with those of the western sector. Higher \nconcentration of lead was also found on juveniles compared to adults of southern \nsector. This can result the assumption that birds breeding on the southern sector are \nsearching for food in more lead contaminated areas that birds form the western sector.\nEssential elements are present in all living organisms and necessary for regulation of \nbody functions and are usually maintained by homeostasis mechanisms, which act in \nthe removal of excess and maintenance of normal body concentrations (Kim and Oh, \n2013).  Not significant correlation levels of essential metals  with body mass may reflect \nthat Shearwaters, when compared with other birds, may use less energy by keeping \nlower metabolic rates (Colwell, 2010) and ingest lower prey mass. Kim et al. (1996) \nresulted that essential metal that their levels are not correlated with body mass reflected \nby low pollution levels (Cr, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn) in their habitats.\nConcentrations of cobalt, chromium, copper, manganese and nickel (Table 3) were \nmuch lower compared to other colonies of related seabird species (Table 1). 2008 was \nthe year with significant higher levels for these metals (Figure 10 K - Figure10 O), with \n\nMASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !34\n\n\n\nan exception of Mn that showed high values also on 2012 and 2014 (Figure 10 - N). \nDifferences for all these metals were found between age and gender (Figure 11 B\u2019 - F\u2019) \nand also between the different breeding sectors (Figure 12 B F). This can be a result of \nthe different metal levels on feeding areas.\nZinc levels (8.84-39.35 ?g/g) were low compared to other seabird species and also from \nshearwaters, breeding in different colonies (Table 1) (Stewart et al., 1996; Stewart et al., \n1997; Eliot et al., 1992; Bond et al., 2010). High zinc concentrations are probably due to \nmetabolic requirements during the process of fledging (Pawel et al. 2000). It has been \nshown experimentally with poultry that high zinc levels are needed for feather growth, \nand indeed deficiency in zinc causes a frayed feather condition (Sunde 1972) and as \nwas expected, juveniles showed significant higher levels of zinc, compared with adult \nbirds (Figure 11 - H\u2019). There were differences on Zn levels between birds from the two \nsub-colonies of Stamfani Island, were the birds from the western sector have significant \nhigher concentrations for juvenile and also adult birds (Figure 12 - H). We assumed that \nthese metal variations could be attributed to different foraging distribution pattern \nfollowed by breeders of the two sub-colonies during the whole breeding season. \nConsequently, the separated feeding areas that birds may use for minimizing \nintraspecific competition for food resources are possibly characterized by different \ncontamination regime. This assumption have to be verified with further tracking studies \non breeders foraging flights combined with metal concentration analysis on their diet \nitems captured within their main foraging areas.\nFurther work on Scopoli\u2019s Shearwater diet would be required for a more detailed \nanalysis to explain the metal concentrations found in the present study. Also, further \nstudies on chick\u2019s diet including analysis of regurgitations could give more information \non the dynamics and accumulation of metals in these shearwaters. This, in turn, would \nallow a greater insight into the baseline levels of metals which in a relatively unpolluted \nenvironment such as the remote Strofades Island complex.\n\nMASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !35\n\n\n\n7. Conclusions\n\nWe examined a variety of metals in blood of juvenile and adults Scopoli\u2019s Shearwaters \nbirds from the Southern Ionian Sea breeding area. The current blood metal levels \nindicate than in general, shearwaters are not at great risk, although our toxicological \nknowledge regarding many elements is insufficient to draw firm conclusions. Scopoli\u2019s \nShearwaters did not have high blood concentrations of Cd and Pb and also of non toxic \nmetals. Further research is needed to determine the contribution of contaminants in the \norgans and do a correlation with feeding areas. \n\nMASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !36\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\nAlonso H., Granadeiro J.P., Paiva V.H., Dias A.S., Ramos J.A., Catry P. 2012.
