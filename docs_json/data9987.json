Estas propriedades \n\nest\u00e3o relacionadas tanto com a sua composi\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica como com a sua \n\nmicroestrutura. Neste estudo, inspirado por estas caracter\u00edsticas e morfologia \n\n\u00fanicas da corti\u00e7a, desenvolveram-se novas espumas de origem renov\u00e1vel com \n\nelevado desempenho. Adicionalmente, devido \u00e0 necessidade premente em \n\ndesenvolver concomitantemente materiais sustent\u00e1veis e processos verdes, estas \n\nnovas bio-espumas foram preparadas seguindo abordagens amigas do ambiente. \n\nEm concreto, elas foram preparadas por polimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o em emuls\u00e3o de Pickering \n\nde \u00f3leo de soja epoxidado acrilatado (AESO) usando celulose bacteriana acetilada \n\ncomo estabilizante da emuls\u00e3o. Adicionalmente, seguindo mais de perto a \n\nmicrostrura e composi\u00e7\u00e3o da corti\u00e7a, prepararam-se espumas sustent\u00e1veis \n\ncontendo concentra\u00e7\u00f5es elevadas de celulose e foram dados os primeiros passos \n\nno sentido destas espumas incorporarem compostos semelhantes \u00e0 lenhina. \n\nAs diversas emuls\u00f5es preparadas bem como as espumas resultantes foram \n\ncaracterizadas detalhadamente atrav\u00e9s de v\u00e1rias t\u00e9cnicas, tais como SEM, \n\nmicroscopia \u00f3ptica, TGA, DMTA, FTIR, estre outras. Verificou-se que a \n\ncomposi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00f3tima da emuls\u00e3o \u00e1gua-em-AESO foi estabilizada com 70% de \u00e1gua \n\no que corresponde a uma emuls\u00e3o do tipo \u2018High Internal Phase Emulsion\u2019 (HIPE). \n\nA microestrutura celular das novas bio-espumas foi confirmada por SEM, \n\nverificado que dependendo da composi\u00e7\u00e3o inicial das emuls\u00f5es (r\u00e1cio \u00e1gua/\u00f3leo) \n\npode-se controlar as dimens\u00f5es e densidades dos poros e assim ajustar a \n\nporosidade \u00e0 da corti\u00e7a. Estudou-se o comportamento t\u00e9rmico das espumas via \n\nTGA, podendo-se concluir que elas t\u00eam um comportamento semelhante \u00e0 corti\u00e7a. \n\n\u00c9 ainda de real\u00e7ar que em termos de an\u00e1lise por DMTA, verificou-se que a \n\ntemperatura de transi\u00e7\u00e3o v\u00edtrea varia entre 30-60 oC. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAno 2015 VI \n\n \nKeywords \n\n \nCork, Quercus suber L., nanocellulose, suberin, lignin, biopolymers, foams, \n\nPickering emulsion polymerisation. \n\nAbstract \n\n \n \n\n Cork material have a very unique set of mechanical and physical \n\nproperties especially high energy absorption, high friction, low acoustic and \n\nthermal conduction, good hydrophobicity and low density. These properties are \n\nstrongly related to the chemical composition of cork, as well as its honeycomb-\n\nlike microstructure. In this study, inspired by these unique features, we have \n\ndeveloped novel high performance bio-foams. Additionally, due to the urgent need \n\nto develop concomitantly sustainable materials and green processes, these novel \n\nfoams were prepared using environment friendly approaches. In this study novel \n\nbio-foams mimicking cork were prepared by Pickering emulsion polymerisation \n\nof acrylated epoxydised soybean oil (AESO) using acetylated bacterial cellulose \n\n(Ac-BC) as an emulsion stabiliser.  \n\nFollowing more closely cork structure and chemical composition, additional \n\nsustainable foams composed of higher concentrations of Ac-BC, were prepared. \n\nAlso, the first steps towards the incorporation of lignin-like compounds in these \n\nfoams were done. \n\nBoth emulsions and ensuing foams were exhaustively characterised by means of \n\nseveral techniques, viz., SEM, optical microscopy, TGA, DMTA, FTIR, among \n\nothers. The stabilisation of a 70% high internal phase water-in-AESO emulsion \n\n(HIPE) was verified. The cellular structure of the novel foams was confirmed by \n\nSEM analysis. It was found that depending on the ratio between water/oil we \n\ncould tune pore dimensions and density, and hence to approach more closely cork \n\nmicrostructure. \n\nMoreover, the new foams thermal properties, especially in terms of thermal \n\nstability, were found to be close to cork behaviour. Furthermore, the mechanical \n\nproperties of the foams were studied by DMTA, and the glass transition value was \n\nfound to be between 30-60 oC. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 VII \n\nTable of Contents \nContext .................................................................................................................................. 1 \n\n1.

The main objective of this study was to prepare novel high \n\nperformance bio-foam materials inspired by cork material, and determinate how changing \n\nthe reaction condition and /or composition tunes the ensuing foam properties. \n\n Moreover, in the past decades the increase of the global environmental awareness \n\nassociated with sustainability and the crude oil depletion, gave rise to an increase interest \n\nin renewable-based materials and eco-friendly processes. In this context, the other aim of \n\nthis study was to define an environmental friendly process to produce these new bio-based \n\nmaterials that will have the advantage of having a controlled homogeneity and cell size. \n\n  This thesis is divided in three main chapters focusing on describing cork and the \n\nprocesses chosen to produce the novel bio-foams, the experiments carried out, and finally \n\nthe results are discussed in the last chapter. \n\n In order to obtain a high performance material, we aim to mimic the chemical \n\ncomposition and structure of cork. The first section of Chapter 1 (1.1 What is cork?) \n\ndescribes cork material structure, composition and its properties. The second section of \n\nChapter 1 (1.2 Process chosen to prepare the bio-foam) describes the methodology used to \n\nproduce the novel composite material. Specifically the Pickering emulsion polymerisation \n\napproach is described and different parameters and elements needed to prepare an \n\nemulsion are highlighted. Chapter 2 (2.

Results and discussion) presents the characterisation techniques \n\nthat were performed at each steps of the herein presented study, namely SEM, TGA and \n\nDMTA, and also describes how the processes were optimised in order to obtain a foam \n\ncloser to cork\u2019s microstructure and composition. This same chapter include also the \n\ndiscussion of these results and ensuing foams. \n\n\n\n\n\nAno 2015 3/59 \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n\n The outer bark of cork oak tree is a natural closed cell material, usually simply \n\ncalled cork. Cork has interesting properties, like for example its hydrophobicity, thermal \n\nand acoustic isolation properties, energy-absorbing capacity, among others1. These \n\ncharacteristics make this natural occurring material suitable for a wide range of fields, \n\nincluding the traditional use in cork stoppers, but also in several modern technologic \n\napplications1. Among the latter, for example, engineers and researchers have already \n\nstarted to replace asbestos, in thermal isolation applications, by cork as an environmental \n\nfriendly alternative and as a low specific gravity filler in the thermal isolation of space \n\nvehicles 2. Cork unique properties, together with its high-tech applications, makes it a very \n\ninspiring material, this study aims precisely to mimic cork microstructure and chemical \n\ncomposition in order to obtain innovative high performance composite materials. \n\n In the first section (1.1. What is cork?), natural cork is described in terms of natural \n\noccurrence, and main applications through time, chemical composition, mechanical and \n\nphysical properties. We will see that cork\u2019s uncommon properties are due to multiple \n\nfactors, including its hexagonal-based polyhedral microstructure. Moreover, its chemical \n\ncomposition is the key to its structure stability and plays a primordial role in its physical \n\nproperties1. \n\n Inspired by cork composition and structure, Pickering emulsion polymerisation is \n\nthe process chosen in the herein presented study to create our new high performance bio-\n\nfoams. The second section (1.2 Process chosen to prepare the bio-foam) describes the \n\nphysical and chemical principles involved with this type of emulsion. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 4/59 \n\n \n\n1.1 What is cork? \n\n Cork is the outer layer of the bark of cork oak tree (Quercu suber L.), thus being the \n\ntree external protective layer, as illustrated in Figure 1.1. Its growth is a reaction of the tree \n\nto the death of the initial phellogen, which can occur by natural accidents (fire, hot or dry \n\nperiods, bacterial or environmental impact) or by removal of the cork layer (for \n\nharvesting). \n\n \n\n The next paragraphs are dedicated to describe cork material; first a brief overview \n\nabout cork\u2019s growth (1.1.1 Formation and growth), afterward to give its history, production \n\nand applications (1.1.2 History, production and applications of cork), its structure and \n\nchemical composition (1.1.3 Structure of cork tissue and 1.1.4 Chemical composition), and \n\nfinally, to describe its mechanical and physical properties.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1: Schematic representation of Quercus suber L. trunk, depicting cork as the outer of the cork \n\noak bark 54. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 5/59 \n\n1.1.1 Formation and growth \n\nThe western Mediterranean basin is the cradle of cork oak forests due to cork oak \n\nenvironmental specific needs. Portugal is the main cork producer with 49.6% of the world \n\nannual production 3 (Figure 1.2).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Cork industry is considered as environmentally friendly 4,5, for example 83% of the \n\ncork oak trees harvested in Portugal are of pure stand (about the same ratio in Spain). \n\nFurthermore, these trees can live about 200 years and are not cut down to harvest the cork. \n\nIt takes approximately 10 years for the cork layer to grow back thick enough, about 4 mm \n\nper year, to be harvest again. We can see in Figure 1.3 a picture of the harvesting of cork \n\noak\u2019s bark. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2: Production of cork and quantity of cork oak planted (source: FAO 2010). \n\nFigure 1.3: Harvesting of cork layers is usually made by hand after the cork oak tree has been \n\nmeticulously chosen. 3 \n\n\n\nAno 2015 6/59 \n\n Structure of cork oak\u2019s tree can be divided in two parts: the inner part (the xylem) \n\nand the outer part (the bark). Cork layers grow as the external part of the bark, as what is \n\nusually called periderm. Contrary to other tree species, the outer protective layer of cork \n\noak has specific properties that make it possible to produce cork in a sustainable way.  \n\n When the outer wall is damaged, for example after harvesting, the first phellogen \n\n(called traumatic periderm) forms very quickly during the first year after the damage. \n\nUnder this first protecting layer, the phellogen start growing a high number of cork close \n\npacked cells at a regular speed and as a regular cylinder around the vertical axis. This \n\nmakes the cork tissue very homogeneous around the axis. But also because of the \n\ntransversal growth, the cells have a specific orientation in their shape (1.1.3. Structure of \n\ncork tissue). However, the growth rate decreases during harvesting years. Going from \n\nabout 6 mm per year in the first year to hardly more than 2 mm after eight years 1. Even so, \n\nthe growth rate increases during the early years of the trees but once they have reached \n\ntheir maturity, this rate decreases every year. For example on a 140 year cork oak, until its \n\n70th year the cork thickness increases from 1,8 cm to almost 3 cm every year, before \n\ndecreasing to 1,5 cm growth during its 140th year1. This irregular growth rate during its life \n\naffects the homogeneity of the cork layer, and could affect its properties too. This \n\nvariablility is a drawback associated to natural material, as cork is. \n\n \n\n1.1.2 History, production and applications of cork \n\n Cork has a long history, dating its first uses to the ancient times where it was used \n\nas such, as raw material, but with the advances of science, its processing changed in order \n\nto enhance some of its properties. In the present section we will shortly describe cork \n\nhistory and the progress in production and applications as years went by. \n\n In Egyptian time, cork was used as stoppers for casks. Ancient Greeks added to this \n\nuse fishing net floats and sandals. Afterwards, Romans widely used cork in a variety of \n\nways, including life jackets for fishermen, still focusing on its non-wettability and low \n\ndensity. Aware of cork\u2019s low thermal conductivity, Mediterranean homebuilder built \n\ncottages, for hundreds of years with cork roofs and floors to keep out summer heat and \n\n\n\nAno 2015 7/59 \n\nwinter cold, and to provide a soft walking surface1. \n\n Since the ancient times of Greeks and Romans until today, cork is used as bottle \n\nstopper material; in order to produce this bottle stoppers cylinders are cut out of raw cork \n\ntissue. This process generates a lot of waste material in between each bottle stopper. \n\nHowever, in the late 19th century, a German company used this cork leftover, by adding a \n\nclay binder to cork particles and producing sheets of cork composites for use as insulation \n\nmaterials6. This technique was improved a few years later by removing the clay binder and \n\ncreating a pure-cork agglomeration out of waste material by subjecting cork particles to \n\nheat and pressure. This started a new area of improvement to create cork composites. Many \n\nother techniques have been developed to produce cork-based material with a variety of \n\nproperties and uses 7. \n\n  \n\nFigure 1.4 summarises some of the applications of cork materials. As already \n\nreferred, the most well-known application for cork material is as bottle stoppers, but cork is \n\nalso used in multiple other fields. For example, white agglomerates of cork (obtained by \n\ngrinding virgin cork) can be used as footwear, protective helmets, life jackets and floats, \n\nfishing rod handles, handbags and briefcases, and even as fabric for clothing and paper. Its \n\nhigh energy-absorption property makes it useful for industrial engines as mechanical joints \n\nor anti-vibration material. Black agglomerate (made from cork waste which is ground and \n\nheated at high temperatures) is used above all for thermal, acoustic, and vibration \n\ninsulation purposes. These grains of cork can also be combined with rubber (rubbercork) \n\nand used as an elastic and strong material for automotive and electrical industries. In the \n\nbuilding industry, sheets of cork composites are used as covering for floors and walls \n\ntaking advantage of the thermal isolation properties and the hydrophobicity of cork. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 8/59 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.4: From left to right: cork stoppers, white and black grains for agglomerates, rubbercork and \n\ncork floor 3. \n\n \n\n1.1.3 Structure of cork tissue \n\n Cork tissue is created layer by layer under the phellogen layer. Its cells are empty \n\nand arranged in a close packed way, without intercellular void. In that way cork tissue is, \n\nby definition, a closed cell material, with a mean value of 10% solid fraction. This very \n\nlow value of solid fraction is associated with cork low density, approximately equal to 120-\n\n170 kg/m3 1.  \n\n As previously mentioned, in section 1.1.1. Formation and growth, the phellogen \n\nmother cells create the cork cells. These mother cells have a hexagonal shape base from \n\nwhich they grow the periderm in a circular growth. Basically, cork tissue looks like a \n\nhoneycomb (Figure 1.5).  \n\n \n\nFigure 1.5: SEM pictures of the honeycomb structure of cork tissues (SEM images from The Museum of \n\nPalaeontology of The University of California at Berkeley and the Regents of the University of California). \n\n\n\nAno 2015 9/59 \n\n \n\n Cork cells are, thus, a hexagonal prism with its face in the axial-tangential plan and \n\nwith its axis symmetry on the radial axis. Its hexagonal base has in average edges of 20 \n\n\u00b5m, and the average length of a cork cell is 40 \u00b5m. The average thickness of a wall is \n\nabout 1 \u00b5m. The shape of the cork cells is sketched in Figure 1.6.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n The radial growth of cork cells creates an intrinsic anisotropy. Besides the obvious \n\nradial axis symmetry of the hexagonal prisms inducing a shape-anisotropy, it creates a \n\nspecific chemical repartition (which will be explained in the following section 1.1.4 \n\nChemical composition). These anisotropies play a primordial role in the various properties \n\nof cork.  \n\n Cork is an extremely complex closed-cell material, and its properties change along \n\nthe radial growth axis during the year. Each of its particularities and changes has an effect \n\non properties of the material. \n\n This honeycomb like structure explains the well-known energy absorption of cork \n\nmaterial in terms of mechanical compression, thermal conduction and acoustic conduction, \n\nthis will be explain more in details in the section 1.1.5 (Mechanical properties of cork) and \n\n(1.1.6 Physical properties). \n\n \n\nFigure 1.6: On the left: Sketch of a cork cell. The black lines represent the edges of the cell and the blue \n\nlines represent the edges of other cork cells surrounding the sketched cork cell. Notice that delimited by \n\nboth blue and black edges we can count 14 faces of contact between cork cells (Telwin polyhedron). On the \n\nright: cell arrangement in typical cork tissue 1. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 10/59 \n\n1.1.4 Chemical composition  \n\n For a material with such a low density and such a complex structure, the fact that \n\nthe cells can keep their shape without collapsing is unique. We have to learn more about \n\nthe chemical composition of cork in order to explain this steadiness. Some of cork \n\nproperties, like for example its chemical inertness, are only due to chemical composition. \n\nBut most of its properties result from both chemical composition and architecture of the \n\ncell wall. \n\n As any other wood tree, cork cell wall is constituted by two types of compounds: \n\nstructural and non-structural compounds 1. The formers are polymeric macromolecules \n\nresponsible for the microstructure of cork; meaning that if we remove them the cell would \n\ncollapse, and in that way they are responsible for most of cork properties. The non-\n\nstructural compounds are, essentially, low molecular weight organic compounds or \n\nmineral, not having an important impact on structural behaviour of cork, mainly \n\ninfluencing its chemical and biological behaviour.  \n\n In this study we will focus on cork's structural components, because the non-\n\nstructural components represent only 2-3% 8 of cork's global chemical composition. \n\nAmong the structural compounds of cork material, we can quote in decreasing order of \n\nweight percentage (wt. %): suberin (up to 58 wt. % 9 of cell wall composition), lignin (c.a. \n\n22 wt. % 9) and polysaccharides (c.a. 18 wt. % 9). The ratios of these compounds are \n\nrepresented in the Figure 1.7, with the comparison of wood and cork of cork oak. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.7: Schematic representation of the proportion of the structural chemical components of cork and \n\ncork oak wood 1. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 11/59 \n\n \n\n  \n\n Figure 1.8 shows a model, proposed by Sitte10, about the structure of cork oak cell \n\nwall. In the outer layer (the primary wall) are lignin and cellulose linked to suberin \n\npolyphenolic domain and finally suberin polyaliphatic domain. The relations between these \n\ncomponents will be detailed in the following sections. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.8: Model, proposed by Sitte, for the topology of cork cell walls10. (T) tertiary wall, (S) secondary \n\nwall, (W) waxes and suberin, (P) primary wall, (M) medium lamella, (Po) pore. \n\n  \n\n The following subsections are dedicated to a brief description of cork suberin \n\n(1.1.4.1), lignin (1.1.4.2) and polysaccharides (1.1.4.3) in order to understand better the \n\neffects of their chemical composition and architecture on cork's properties, in section 1.1.5. \n\nMechanical properties of cork and 1.1.6. Physical properties. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.1.4.1 Suberin \n\n \n\n In the literature, there are reported suberin amounts in cork oak bark ranging from \n\n\n\nAno 2015 12/59 \n\n37,8 % 9,11 up to 60-62 % 8,12, therefore suberin is the most important component of cork \n\ntissue. But, besides being the most abundant component of cork, suberin is the only \n\nstructural compound of cork that is not present in the wood of cork oak (Figure 1.7). It \n\ntakes part in the stability of the structure of cork cells, as it has been experimentally \n\nobserved the collapse of the cells after partially removing it 9.  \n\n Suberin is also found in other plants and even in different morphological parts of \n\nthe plants13. For example, this biopolymer is present in the underground part of plants (e.g. \n\ntuber phellem of potato) or in the wounded upper part of the plant, acting as a protective \n\nbarrier between the plant and the environment 14 and, in some plant cells, providing water \n\nretention 15. In the last decade, the definition of suberin has been actively discussed. In the \n\nfollowing section we will describe the broad-accepted model suggested by Bernards 15.  \n\n According to this model \u201csuberin is a natural aliphatic\u2013aromatic cross-linked \n\npolyester\u201d 13. It is indeed composed by two domains: the suberin polyaliphatic domain and \n\nthe suberin polyaromatic (or poly(phenolic)) domain, denoted by SPAD and SPPD, \n\nrespectively 15. Several studies showed that SPAD and SPPD represent more or less 50% \n\neach of suberin 16,17. The two suberin domains are cross-linked by ester linkages and \n\nglycerol links. The importance of glycerol in the linkage and the chemical architecture has \n\nbeen taken into account very late in the study of cork suberin, and there is still a lot to \n\ndetermine about its role in suberized cells. Gra\u00e7a and Pereira 8 studies reported up to 14% \n\nof glycerol in their chemical analysis of cork suberin. \n\n \n\n There were a huge number of studies 8,10\u201312,14,17,18 focused on determining the \n\ncomposition of suberin, however depending on the method used and the sensitivity of the \n\nanalysis devices, and/or the sample analysed, the identified compounds, but especially their \n\namounts changed. Gandini summed-up most of these studies in 2006 13. Anyway, all the \n\nresults tend to have the same order of magnitude for the amount of each family of \n\ncompounds in cork suberin. \n\n The suberin polyaliphatic domain is mainly composed of long carbon chain fatty \n\nacids essentially ranging from C16 to C26. Typically, in decreasing order of weight \n\npercentage magnitude there is: ?-hydroxyalkanoic acids (representing up to 62% of \n\nsuberin monomers 18), then ?, ?-alkanedioic acids (representing up to 46% 17), and finally \n\n\n\nAno 2015 13/59 \n\naliphatic acids and fatty acids represent around 10 to 15%, respectively12. These long \n\ncarbon chains (C16 to C26) are associated to cork tissue flexibility and hydrophobicity13, \n\nthis suberin domain is also named waxes of suberin14. Some of the most abundant \n\ncompounds found in the SPAD are represented in Figure 1.9. In the chemical architecture \n\nof suberin, all these monomers are linked within the SPAD, typically by ester links, \n\ncreating the so-called suberin oligomeric blocks 14 .  \n\n \n\nFigure 1.9: Representation of typical monomers composing the SPAD of cork, organised from top to \n\nbottom in the lowering concentration order 13. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 14/59 \n\n \n\n For a long time, it was discussed the existence of suberin polyaromatic domain 19, \n\nalso called suberin polyphenolic domain; it was considered at first that lignin had the role \n\nof the aromatic domain in suberized cells. However, several studies 20\u201322 have shown \u201cthat \n\nsuberized tissues contain a significant amount of hydroxycinnamic acids and a relatively \n\nsmaller amount of monolignols than that expected for a lignified tissue\u201d15 , this discover \n\nhave trigger the definition of this domain of suberin: the SPPD. As previously mentioned, \n\nthe polyaromatic part of suberin is composed by cross-linked hydroxycinnamic acids, the \n\nphenolic precursors of this domain are represented in Figure 1.10.  \n\n \n\n \n\n This domain is segregated from the aliphatic domain of suberin but is covalently \n\nbounded to the latter, typically by glycerol units. The SPPD is contained in the primary cell \n\nwall of the cork cell, which means that it is also the link between suberin and lignin in the \n\narchitecture of the cell wall (as represented in Figure 1.8). The linking between SPPD and \n\nlignin is still under study but some hypotheses consider it to be fused with lignin-cellulose \n\nmatrix 10,13,23,24; Gandini stated in 200613: \u201cThis lignin-like suberin fraction, at least in the \n\ncase of Q. suber cork cells, is embedded (not spatially segregated) in the lignin-\n\ncarbohydrate matrix of the primary cell wall\u201d. These domains mainly composed by cyclic \n\ncarbons monomers are taking part of the rigidity of cork material and so helping the \n\nsteadiness of the structure of the cells. \n\n Based on all these observations and the studies quoted in the previous paragraphs, \n\nBernards proposed in 200215 a model of the chemical architecture of suberin embedded in \n\nthe cell wall topography, this model is represented in the Figure 1.11. We can see the SPPD \n\nFigure 1.10: Phenolic precursors detected in the SPPD domain of cork 13. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 15/59 \n\nbelonging to the primary cell wall and the SPAD is part of the suberin lamellae (Figure \n\n1.8).  \n\n  \n\n \n\n In conclusion, suberin is the main (>50%) 9 structural polymer of cork cell walls. It \n\nis composed of a cross-linked aliphatic domain (long carbon chains (50% of suberin)16,17) \n\nwhich give the flexibility of the cell wall and an aromatic part (mainly acids-based \n\nmoieties like hydroxycinnamic acids) linked by esterification, ether linkage and glycerol \n\ncross-linking to the aliphatic domain, giving their rigidity to the cell walls. \n\n  \n\n1.1.4.2 Lignin \n It has been noticed also the occurrence of a second type of polyaromatic cork \n\ndomain, the well-known lignin-fraction. Lignin is the second most important component of \n\nFigure 1.11: Suberin structure proposed by Bernard in 2002, we can see the aromatic domain of the \n\nsuberin as the primary cell wall, and the aliphatic part as the lamellae suberin. 11 We can notice the \n\npresence of phenolic functions in the aliphatic domain of suberin underlining a complex 3D structure \n\nwhere these parts are fold and linked to the aromatic domain of suberin. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 16/59 \n\ncork material, representing around 22 wt% of the cell walls mass8. As it has been shown \n\nfor suberin, if lignin is removed from the cell wall, the cork cell collapsed 9. In that sense \n\nlignin is also a structural polymer of the cork cell wall. \n\n  Lignin is the result of \u201cthe dehydrogenation of phenolic precursors, like coniferyl \n\nalcohol (Figure 1.12), via a free-radical coupling process\u201d 25. Cork lignin is mainly (95%) \n\ncomposed of guaiacyl type lignin that is mainly derived from coniferyl alcohol, as in \n\nsoftwoods. Radical-radical coupling between coniferyl alcohol can be done by various \n\nbonds. The different coupling between the phenolic precursors units and the aromatic \n\ncarbon ring structure give to lignin a rigid chemical structure which contributes to the \n\nmechanical properties of cork material. \n\n \n\n As shown in the Figure 1.8 and described in the previous section, lignin is a \n\ncomponent of the primary cell wall: composing the matrix in which the polyaromatic \n\ndomain of suberin is embedded. Other components of this matrix are polysaccharides. \n\n \n\n1.1.4.3 Polysaccharides \n \n\n The third structural polymers of plant cells are cellulose and hemicelluloses, \n\nrepresenting around 20% of dry mass weight in cork 9. Polysaccharides are quite less \n\nabundant in cork than in wood or in other bark tissues (around 70%) 9. Like for suberin and \n\nlignin, the structural importance of polysaccharides, was shown by removing them from \n\ncork cell and observing the collapse of the cells 9.  \n\n Cellulose is a linear homopolysaccharide of glucose molecules linked through ?-1-\n\nFigure 1.12: Coniferyl alcohol. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 17/59 \n\n4 glycosidic bonds (Figure 1.13). In cork cell, cellulose (approximately 10 %wt) is located \n\nin the primary (external wall) and tertiary (intercellular wall) walls.  \n\n \n\n \n\n1.1.5 Mechanical properties of cork \n\n \n\n The preceding description of the geometrical and chemical structure of cork is of \n\nupmost importance due to the fact that they have an enormous impact on the properties of \n\nthis material including the mechanical properties described in this subsection. \n\n We have to keep in mind the anisotropy of cork cells during all mechanical tests, \n\neven if the cell may answer in the same way to tangential and axial stresses, the radial \n\nresponse will surely be different, as we can see in the curves of tensile test shown in the \n\ngraph of Figure 1.146.  \n\nFigure 1.13: Cellulose unit cell, with a ? -(1-4) glycosidic bond. \n\nFigure 1.14: Stress\u2013strain curves in tensile tests for cork, in all directions: T, tangential; A, axial; R, radial 6. \n\n \n\n\n\nAno 2015 18/59 \n\n \n\n \n\n Typically, the stress vs. strain (? vs. ?) curves of cork are divided in three regions, as \n\nexpected for cellular foam materials response to compression, and as illustrated in the \n\ncurves of Figure 1.156. At low strains, inferior to 7% 6, is observed a relatively abrupt \n\nyielding corresponding to the elastic deformation of the cells, typically with a stress equal \n\nto c.a. 0,25 MPa in axial (A) and tangential (T) directions and c.a. 0,5 MPa in the radial \n\n(R) direction1. Increasing the strain, a second region is reached, corresponding to the \n\nelastic buckling of the cells (up to 50%6 strain, for 0,7 MPa in T and A directions and 1,2 \n\nMPa in radial direction)1. The cell walls can buckle without fracture or permanent damages \n\nof the walls. Finally, at higher strains, the last region corresponds to a densification of the \n\ncork resulting from the collapsing of the cells. A maximum densification is observed up to \n\n85% strain (corresponding to more than 3 MPa1). Notwithstanding, even after total \n\ndensification of the cork tissue, it was not detected fracture or fissures in the cell walls 6. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.15: Typical compressive stress vs. strain curve of cork 6. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 19/59 \n\n \n\n As we have seen in the compression strain measurement, cork cells have the \n\ncapacity to bend without breaking, originating a plateau in the stress-strain compression \n\ncurves and it explain also the very low Poisson coefficient of cork in radial compression. \n\nInstead of transferring the force from a cell wall to the cell walls perpendicular to the force, \n\nthe walls absorb the energy by collapsing. In non-radial direction, the Poisson coefficient is \n\neven negative, and by applying the force on the sides of the hexagonal base, these phases \n\nare squeezed which increase their radial dimension. \n\n \n\n1.1.6 Physical properties \n\n In terms of physical properties, both cork chemical composition and structure play \n\nan important role. Cork has a low wettability to polar liquids (contact angle of 85\u00b0 with \n\nwater)1 but it has a high affinity with non-polar liquids, which can be easily understood \n\nhaving in mind its chemical composition, especially the nature of its main component, \n\nsuberin. This affinity between cork and non-polar (macro)molecules can be interesting in \n\ncomposites processing. \n\n Cork has also a high friction due to its high energy absorption capacity in \n\ncompression and the high surface roughness. \n\n Its low solid fraction and hollow cell-like architecture is associated with cork\u2019s very \n\npoor heat transfer properties by absorption of gas convection and heat radiation. \n\n \n\n1.1.7 Interests of cork \n\n As mentioned earlier in this chapter, cork is a low density, closed-cell, cellular \n\nmaterial with a solid fraction of around 10 to 20%. Its growth takes several years. \n\nFurthermore, cork has several desired properties, like for example its hydrophobicity, heat \n\nand acoustic isolation ability, high energy absorption or friction. Cork is not only \n\ninteresting in terms of mechanical performance, but also its physical and thermal properties \n\nare highly sought-after. In fact, apart from its traditional application in the production of \n\ncork stoppers, cork is starting to be implemented in several new technologies and high-tech \n\n\n\nAno 2015 20/59 \n\nfields. \n\nCork is a very complex material. This complexity can be seen in multiple ways: structural \n\narrangement of the mater, chemical composition, arrangement of the components in the \n\ncell walls in order to sustain the microstructure.  \n\nIt is also recognized that the mechanical and physical properties of cork are closely linked \n\nto its high complexity. \n\n \n\n This study aims, precisely, to obtain an innovative bio-based material, with \n\ninteresting properties, by mimicking cork composition and morphology. Hence, in order to \n\nachieve such a complex biomaterial we had to choose chemical processes that could create \n\na porous material based on biopolymers, in which the cells are close packed and \n\nhomogenous, and more, that uses environmental friendly conditions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2 Process chosen to prepare the bio-foams \n\n \n\n Among the wide number of bio-based porous materials existing today, some of the \n\nmost interesting ones are those based on cellulose, and more recently on nanocellulose due \n\nto their properties and multiple applications, like for example, immobilization of enzymes \n\n26, thermal and acoustic insulation materials, also in pharmaceutical and biomedical \n\nfields27. These porous materials can be prepared by several approaches, probably one of the \n\nmost popular is by polyurethane foams synthesis, however, the increase of environmental \n\nawareness shifted the researches towards greener processes and green materials. Among \n\nthose, cellulose is a bio-material easy to produce and to use. Thus in 1931, S. Kistler 28 \n\ncreated new cellulose-based foams, specifically cellophane aerogels, this date marks the \n\nbeginning of the development of a lot of other cellulose aerogels using distinct \n\nmethodologies. \n\nInspired by cork composition and structure, the Pickering emulsion polymerisation \n\nwas selected aiming to create a close cell material. Nanocellulose was selected as stabilizer \n\nand Acrylated Epoxidised Soybean Oil (AESO) was selected to create a matrix that mimic \n\n\n\nAno 2015 21/59 \n\nthe long chain fatty acids of suberin. \n\n In the following section a background description of this process and the chemical \n\nmechanisms behind them will be provided. Firstly, the principles associated with \n\nemulsions and emulsion polymerisation will be described, then the specific emulsions \n\nchosen for this process, the Pickering emulsions will be explained. \n\n \n\n1.2.1 Emulsions  \n\n An emulsion is a dispersion of one liquid in another liquid, which are immiscible. \n\nThere are several examples of emulsions which can be found in food, e.g., vinaigrette, \n\nmilk, mayonnaise, among many others29. \n\n Almost all emulsions involve water as one phase and an organic liquid as the other \n\nphase. The latter is usually referred to as the \u2018oil\u2019. Hence, there are two main types of \n\nemulsions, i.e., \u2018oil-in-water\u2019 (o/w) and \u2018water-in-oil\u2019 (w/o). In an emulsion, the two liquids \n\nstay immiscible, but one of the two phases is dispersed, as droplets, in the second one. The \n\nformer liquid is called dispersed phase, and the latter liquid is designated by continuous \n\nphase. Figure 1.16 30 shows a schematic illustration of an emulsion. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.16: Sketch of an emulsion, here oil-in-water emulsion30. \n\n \n\nFor example, if an oil is dispersed in water without the presence of a stabilizer, the \n\nstability of this o/w emulsion tends to be poor30. Hence, the oil droplets tend to coalesce. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 22/59 \n\nThe introduction of a surfactant in the mixture creates micelles of one liquid, dispersed in \n\nthe second liquid, stabilizing the emulsion. The separation between the dispersed phase and \n\nthe continuous one is called the interface. This interface is composed by the emulsifier that \n\nis a substance helping the stabilization of the emulsion. They are usually amphiphilic \n\nmolecules with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts, which is why surfactants are good \n\nemulsifiers.  \n\n \n\n1.2.2 Emulsion polymerisation \n\n \n\n Emulsions have been used in several applications including the performance of \n\npolymerisation reactions, like for example radical or polycondensation polymerisation \n\nreactions31. As previously described, an emulsion contains two phases and a stabilizer, \n\ntypically a surfactant. Based on that fact, there is a creation of micelles by one of the two \n\nphases which can act as reactors, to have a localized chemical reaction in one of these two \n\nphases. This is the principle of emulsion polymerisation, which is sketched in Figure 1.17.  \n\n \n\nFigure 1.17: Emulsion polymerisation principle30. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 23/59 \n\n \n\n For example, in a radical polymerisation conducted in an o/w emulsion, droplets of \n\nmonomers are dispersed in water. The introduction of a surfactant creates smaller micelles \n\nof monomer. Then a water-soluble initiator is introduced. Because the micelles are smaller \n\nand in bigger number than the monomer droplets, their surface area is higher, and so the \n\ninitiator diffuse in the micelles where it start the radical polymerisation. As the quantity of \n\nmonomer in the micelle decreases, monomers diffuse from the monomer droplets toward \n\nthe continuous phase, then toward the micelles. This process goes on until all the droplets \n\nof monomers have the same size as the micelles. \n\n1.2.3 Pickering polymerisation \n\n \n\n In the early 20th century, Ramsden32 and Pickering33 observed that the stabilisation \n\nof an emulsion occurred not only with surfactants but also with the help of small, micro-\n\nsized particles within the interface of the emulsion. Specifically, Ramsden32 observed the \n\neffect of the addition of a clay, while Pickering33 studied natural \u201cemulsion with insoluble \n\nemulsifiers\u201d, like cream/milk emulsion or the use of copper sulphate particles as \n\nemulsifiers. This type of emulsions took the name of one of the researchers: Pickering \n\nemulsions. An example from everyday life is mayonnaise, which is a Pickering water-in-oil \n\nemulsion where the vinegar is the dispersed phase, olive oil is the continuous phase, egg \n\nyolk is the emulsifier (a surfactant) and small particles of mustard help the stabilization of \n\nthe emulsion. Pickering managed to create emulsions with up to 60% of oil as the \n\ndispersed phase using copper or iron sulphates33. \n\n In 1923, Finkle wrote the so called Finkle rule, which describes \u201cthe correlation \n\nbetween the wettability of particles and their ability to stabilise emulsions\u201d34. It also \n\nexplained the stability of o/w or w/o emulsions depending on the contact angle between the \n\ndifferent phases. We call phase inversion to the phenomena that after a certain phase ratio, \n\nthe dispersed phase become the continuous phase and the continuous phase become the \n\ndispersed phase. By tuning the concentration of the different phases, we reach a maximum \n\nconcentration of the dispersed phase before the phase inversion occurs and change the \n\n\n\nAno 2015 24/59 \n\ndispersed phase into the external phase; this maximum is \u201cstrongly dependent on the \n\naffinity of the particles for the initial continuous phase\u201d34. To evaluate if the particles of \n\nemulsifier are stable at the interface between oil and water, we have to determinate its free \n\nenergy of detachment. This energy is the difference between the surface free energy of the \n\nsystem before and after being absorbed by the interface. As represented in Figure 1.18 the \n\nfree energy of detachment from the interface toward the water can be calculated as follow \n\n(1):  \n\n ?Gdetach =  ?owA\n(2)\n\now + ?pwA\n(2)\n\npw \u2013 (?owA\n(1)\n\now + ?pwA\n(1)\n\npw + ?poA\n(1)\n\npo)  (1) \n\nWhere the ?po, ?pw, and ?ow are the particle-oil, particle-water and oil\u2013water interfacial \n\ntensions, respectively. \n\n We can see then, knowing Young's equation, that the contact angle of the particle \n\nwith each liquid will impact the value of the free energy of detachment. Considering small \n\nsize and spherical particles (radius R) and a chemically smooth and homogeneous surface, \n\nwe can obtain from equation (1) the following equation of the free energy of attachment of \n\nthe particle to the surface (- ?Gdetach):  \n\n \n\n  ?Gattach= - ?R\u00b2?ow(1 - |cos(?)|)\u00b2      (2) \n\n \n\n The value obtain via the equation (2) is negative for all the contact angles, which \n\nmean that the particles will accumulate at the interface. Like so, Pickering emulsions are \n\nvery stable emulsion 34. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 25/59 \n\n \n\n \n\n Pickering stabilised emulsion polymerisations have been already used to produce \n\nnanofoams31,35\u201338. The possibility to stabilise an emulsion up to 70% internal phase \n\n(dispersed phase) compared to the external phase without undergoing a phase inversion has \n\nbeen shown by Blaker and Lee 37, using hydrophobized bacterial nanocellulose. Using such \n\na template to realise a poly-Pickering-M/HIPEs (Medium/High Internal Phase Emulsions) \n\n39 could help us getting closer to the 20% solid fraction of cork. Figure 1.19 illustrate a \n\nSEM image of the acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO) foam obtained using this \n\nmethod. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.18: Schematic representation of a solid particle, absorbed in the emulsion interface \n\n(state 1) and in the water (state 2).34 \n\n\n\nAno 2015 26/59 \n\n \n\n \n\n More recently, in 2014, Tasset et al. 40 managed to produce a promising cellular \n\nfoam \u201cprepared by freeze-drying oil-in-water emulsions stabilized with cellulose \n\nnanocrystals\u201d40. Figure 1.20 show the SEM picture of these cellular AESO foam obtained \n\nin this study. They also showed that the size of the cells can be controlled by the \n\nconcentration of the oil and the thickness of the wall by the concentration of CNCs.  \n\nFigure 1.19: SEM images of the AESO foam obtained by Blaker and Lee 37. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 27/59 \n\n \n\n  \n\nInspired by these two studies, and by the need of environmental friendly methods to \n\nprepare biomaterials, this study mimics the microstructure and chemical composition of \n\ncork tissue by Pickering emulsion approaches using bio-based raw materials in order to \n\nproduce innovative materials. \n\nFigure 1.20: SEM images of cellular foams made of CNCs alone at two concentrations, (a\u2013c) 5 \n\ng.L-1 and (d\u2013f) 10 g.L-1.40 \n\n\n\n\n\nAno 2015 29/59 \n\n \n\n2 Experimental part \n\n \n\n The following section describes in detail the materials and methods used \n\nthroughout this study. Firstly the reactants and other chemicals are listed; followed by the \n\ncomprehensive description of the procedures adopted. Finally, the techniques used for the \n\nanalysis of the samples are described. \n\n2.1 Materials and reagents \n\n The cellulose substrates used in this study were from two distinct natures, namely: \n\ni) bacterial cellulose (BC) (three-dimensional network of nano and microfibrils with 10-\n\n200 nm width), in the form of wet membranes, produced at our laboratory using  the \n\nGluconoacetobacter sacchari bacterial strain41,42 and following established culture \n\nprocedures43; ii) microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), under the trade name Avicel PH-101 \n\n(3\u20135 % moisture content), purchased from Fluka. \n\n For the acetylation, the reagents used are: acetic acid anhydride from Chem-Lab \n\n(99% - 100% pure) and sulfuric acid from Acros Organics (solution in water, 96% pure). \n\n The monomer used, acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO, containing 4000 ppm \n\nof monomethyl ether hydroquinone as inhibitor), divinylbenzene with an 80% mixture of \n\nisomers, namely 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol (DVB, >98%), and 4-acetoxystyrene (>96%) \n\nwere purchased from Sigma Aldrich-Chemicals Corp. \n\n The photo-initiators adopted to carried out the UV photo-polymerisation reactions, \n\n2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenyl-propan-1-one (Irgacure 1173, old Darocur 1173), 2,2-di- \n\nmethoxy-1,2-diphenylethan-1-one (Irgacure 651) and 1-hydroxy-cyclohexyl-phenyl-ketone \n\n(Irgacure 184), were all purchased from BASF. \n\n All the solvents employed were analytically pure and all other reagents were used \n\nas received. \n\n \n\n\n\nAno 2015 30/59 \n\n2.2 Methodology \n\n \n\n2.2.1 Acetylation of BC \n\n Prior to the acetylation reaction, BC fibres were disintegrated and solvent \n\nexchanged from water to ethanol. Briefly, the BC fibres were disintegrated using an Ultra-\n\nTurrax equipment at 11 000 rpm, for 1 hour, as illustrated in Scheme 2-1. Afterwards, the \n\nBC dispersing solvent was exchanged, by centrifugation, from water to ethanol, and then \n\nfrom ethanol to acetone, using a centrifuge Rotofix 32A and a Pselecta mixta, at 4 500 \n\nrpm, during 15 minutes. For each solvent the centrifugation step was repeated five times. \n\nThe BC was then pressed and filtrated in order to remove the solvent in excess. \n\n \n\nScheme 2-1: Scheme of the acetylation process. \n\n \n\n The BC acetylation was carried out, following a procedure described by Gandini et \n\nal.44. Approximately 300 mL of acetic acid anhydride and 1 mL of H2SO4 were added to 20 \n\ng of BC, the mixture was heated at 30 \u00b0C, during 4 hours, under a N2 atmosphere. Then, \n\nthe reaction mixture was stirred with an excess of water and the acetylated BC (Ac-BC) \n\nfibres isolated and washed sequentially with cold acetone, ethanol, water, and finally again \n\nwith ethanol. \n\n Subsequently, aiming at removing any residual trace of acetic anhydride and/or \n\nother impurities, the fibres were Soxhlet extracted with ethanol, during 12 hours. The Ac-\n\nBC fibres were dispersed in water and they were ready for the emulsion preparation acting \n\nas a stabiliser. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 31/59 \n\n2.2.2 Pickering emulsion polymerisation of AESO \n\n2.2.2.1 Water-in-AESO Pickering emulsions \n\n \n\n The water-in-AESO emulsions were prepared following an adapted procedure \n\ndescribed by Blaker and Lee37. Typically, they were performed in a Falcon tube (50 mL) \n\nusing approximately 10 mL of AESO and 10 ml of water containing 0.5 wt% of Ac-BC. \n\nThe mixture was heated at 80\u00b0C, for 30 minutes, and promptly homogenized by hand \n\nshaking during 1 minute. This procedure was repeated every 12 hours, for 7 days. The \n\nensuing product was a stable emulsion after 3 days (Figure 2.1) as will be explained, in \n\ndetail, in the next section (3. Results and discussion). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1: Stable water-in-AESO (above the red line) emulsion and ejected AESO (under the red line). \n\n \n\n To polymerise the AESO with the MCC particles inside the matrix, the same \n\nprocedure was used, but after adding the water, 1.1 g of MCC was added to the mixture. \n\nThen the procedure was carried out in the same way as the previous preparation. \n\n2.2.2.2 Water-in-AESO/cyclohexane Pickering emulsions \n\n  \n\nWater-in-AESO/cyclohexane emulsions were also prepared following the same procedure \n\ndescribed by Blaker and Lee37. Typically, these emulsions were prepared in a Falcon tube \n\n(50 mL) using approximately 5 mL of AESO, 5 mL of cyclohexane and 10 ml of water \n\ncontaining 0.5 wt% of Ac-BC. First the 5 mL AESO and the 5mL of cyclohexane were \n\n\n\nAno 2015 32/59 \n\nhomogenised using an ultrasound bath, for 1 minute. Then, the water and Ac-BC was \n\nadded to the mixture, promptly homogenised by hand shaking, for 1 minute and allowed to \n\nrest for 12 hours, at about 4 \u00b0C. Finally, the mixture was re-agitated. The ensuing product \n\nwas a stable emulsion after 3 days of resting, as illustrated in the picture of Figure 2.2. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2.2.3 Photo-polymerisation of water-in-AESO emulsions. \n\n \n\nTypically, the UV-photoinitiator Irgacur 1173 (0.4 wt% relatively to AESO) was \n\nadded to the water-in-AESO stable emulsions (4 days), the mixture was shaken by hand, \n\nand heated at 80 \u00b0C (capped and protected from light) until a stable emulsion volume \n\n(around 15 mL) was reached. Samples were then irradiated during 6 hours with UV light, \n\nusing a mercury lamp (100 W and >280 nm), to photopolymerise the AESO phase. The \n\nensuing foams were removed from the Falcon tube and dried, during 24h at 50 \u00b0C.  Figure \n\n2.3 shows an illustrative picture of an AESO-foam obtained by this process. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3: Transversal cut of an AESO foam produced by UV photopolymerisation of Pickering \n\nemulsion stabilised with cellulose nanofibers. \n\n  \n\nFigure 2.2: Stable water-in-AESO/cyclohexane emulsion (under the red line) and ejected \n\nAESO/cyclohexane (over the red line) \n\n\n\nAno 2015 33/59 \n\n2.2.2.4 Photo-polymerisation of water-in-AESO/cyclohexane emulsions. \n\n \n\nThe water-in-AESO/cyclohexane emulsions were polymerised using a similar \n\nprocess. The UV-photoinitiator Irgacur 1173 (0.4 wt% relatively to AESO) was added to \n\nthe water-in-AESO/cyclohexane stable emulsions (4 days), shaken by hand, and left in the \n\nrefrigerator (capped and protected from light) until a stable emulsion volume (around 15 \n\nmL) was reached. The ejected oil phase (5 mL) was removed, then the samples were \n\nirradiated during 6 hours with UV light, using a mercury lamp (100 W and >280 nm), to \n\nphotopolymerise the AESO phase. The ensuing foams were removed from the Falcon tube \n\nand dried, during 24h, at 50 \u00b0C. Figure 2.4 shows an illustrative picture of an AESO-foam \n\nobtained by this process. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4: AESO foam produced by UV photopolymerisation of water-in-AESO/cyclohexane \n\nPickering emulsion stabilised with cellulose nanofibers. \n\n \n\n2.2.3 Photo-polymerisation of aromatic monomers  \n\n \n\n Divinyl benzene, 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol and acetoxy-styrene monomers were \n\nphoto-polymerised according to the following process: approximately 0,4 g of each \n\nmonomers were mixed with 0,4 wt% of photo-initiator (Irgacur 184, 651, 1173). The \n\nmixture was then deposited on a lamella, and exposed to a UV radiation (11 W, 280 nm) \n\nduring 6 to 8 hours to photopolymerise the monomer. The obtained films were the washed \n\nwith chloroform to remove any residues of monomer and/or initiator, and dried. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 34/59 \n\n \n\n2.3 Characterisation \n\n \n\n The obtained materials were characterised using several techniques including \n\nAttenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (ATR FTIR), \n\nThermogravimetry Analysis (TGA), Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMTA), \n\noptic microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).  \n\n2.3.1 Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy \n\n \n\n The ATR FTIR spectra were acquired using a Paragon 1000 Perkin-Elmer FTIR \n\nspectrophotometer equipped with a single horizontal Golden Gate ATR cell. The spectra \n\nwere recorded at a resolution of 4 cm-1, after 64 scans with a range of 1 cm-1. \n\n \n\n2.3.2 Thermogravimetric Analysis \n\n \n\n TGA analyses were carried out with a SETSYS Setaram TGA analyser equipped \n\nwith a aluminum cell. Typically, samples (~17 mg) were heated at a constant rate of 10 \n\noC.min-1, from 25 \u00b0C to 800 \u00b0C, under a nitrogen flow of 20 ml.min-1. \n\n \n\n2.3.3 Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis \n\n \n\n DMTA measurements of thick specimens (1 x 1 x 0.6 cm3) were carried out with \n\nTritec 2000 DMTA Triton equipment operating in the compression mode. Tests were \n\nperformed at 1 and 10 Hz, and the temperature was varied from -50 to 200 \u00b0C at 2 \u00b0C min-\n\n1. Each measurement was repeated up to three times. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 35/59 \n\n \n\n2.3.4 Optical microscopy \n\n \n\n The optical microscope images were captured with an IDS UI124DML numerical \n\ncamera mounted on an Olympus Microscope BX51, with options of magnification as \n\nfollow: ocular x10 and objectives x5, x10 and x20. \n\n \n\n2.3.5 Scanning Electron Microscopy \n\n \n\n SEM images of the cross-section of foam specimens were acquired using a field \n\nemission gun-SEM Hitachi SU70 microscope operated at 15 kV. Samples were deposited \n\non a sample holder. Before observation, the samples were coated twice with evaporated \n\ncarbon. The magnifications used to capture the pictures were x60, x130, x1500, x2500 and \n\nx15000. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAno 2015 37/59 \n\n \n\n3 Results and discussion \n\n \n\n Cork is an interesting material with unique properties, as have been emphasised \n\nthroughout this Thesis and in particular in Chapter 1. Inspired by cork unique features, in \n\nthe present study, novel cellular foams based essentially on soybean oil and cellulose were \n\ndeveloped. These foams were prepared by Pickering emulsion polymerisation of acrylated \n\nepoxidised soybean oil (Figure 3.1) selected as the continuous oil phase, because it is \n\ncomposed of fatty acids linked with glycerol, closely resembling the chemical composition \n\nof cork\u2019s suberin. The dispersed phase was water. Additionally, we have selected Ac-BC \n\nnanofibrils for stabilising the Pickering emulsion in order to mimic the cork composition. \n\nMoreover, the nanofibers were embedded inside the foam, also resembling the architecture \n\nof cork. Hence, the ensuing emulsions were w/o. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1: Structure of acrylated epoxidised soybean oil (AESO)45. \n\n \n\n The stability of the emulsion and the water/oil ratio were assessed by visual \n\ninspection and optical microscopy. At each step of biomaterials preparation, the products of \n\nthe reaction were extensively characterised by ATR FTIR and SEM. Additionally, The \n\nensuing foams were characterised with SEM, TGA and DMTA. \n\n The following sections present the main results and discussions of acetylation of \n\nbacterial cellulose nanofibers (section 3.1), stabilisation of Pickering emulsions (section \n\n3.2), the UV photopolymerisation of AESO (section 3.3) and finally the characterisation of \n\nthe ensuing products (section 3.4). All the experimental details related with the present \n\n\n\nAno 2015 38/59 \n\nchapter are summarised in Chapter 2. \n\n \n\n3.1 Acetylation of bacterial cellulose fibres \n\nAfter purification and hydrophobisation of the cellulose nanofibrils, we can use \n\nthem as a stabilizer of the Pickering emulsion. The nanofibrils will assemble themselves in \n\na cellular template which will be the basis of the emulsion polymerisation of the AESO.  \n\n After biosynthesis, bacterial cellulose fibrils are naturally hydrophilic. In order to \n\nbe used as stabilisers for w/o Pickering emulsions, the contact angle BC/water, also called \n\nadvancing contact angle, had to be increased37, to do so they were hydrophobised by \n\nacetylation of the hydroxyl groups. The acetylation reaction was perform by adapting \n\nacetylation reactions conditions from litterature37,44. However, oppositely to the some \n\nacetylation procedures described in literature, such as the one by Blacker et al. 37, the one \n\nwe have adopted is more environmentally friendly, avoiding accordingly the massive use \n\nof toxic solvents, pyridine or p-toluenesulfonyl chloride and hard reaction conditions. The \n\nprocedure adopted here was carried out using only acetic anhydride and sulphuric acid. \n\nThe acetylation reaction is schematically represented in Scheme 3-1. \n\n \n\n  \n\n The success of this reaction was confirmed by ATR FTIR spectroscopy, as clearly \n\nshown in Figure 3.2, by the appearance of a new characteristic band near 1735 cm-1, \n\ntypically ascribed to the stretching mode of the carbonyl ester groups (?C=O)\n46. Besides the \n\nappearance of this band, a significant reduction of the O-H stretching modes (at 3342 cm-1, \n\nrespectively) also confirmed the acetylation reaction occurred and moreover pointed out \n\nfor an extensive acetylation of BC fibres, which most probably has occurred not only at the \n\nsurface but also at the bulk. The impact of the degree of acetylation on the emulsion \n\nScheme 3-1: Acetylation reaction. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 39/59 \n\nstability and hence on foams morphology and related mechanical properties would be of \n\nupmost interest to be apprehended in further studies. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2: FTIR spectra of BC before and after acetylation.  \n\n \n\n The hydrophobic nature of the Ac-BC fibres was evident by their low affinity to \n\nacetone, ethanol and especially water used during washing and solvent exchanges. In the \n\nwork of Blaker et al.37, they reported an increased contact angle of 64\u00b0 (from 11\u00b0 to 75\u00b0) \n\nfrom neat BC to acetylated BC. The contact angle of the Ac-BC films were measured at \n\nroughly 77\u00b0, which confirm the hydrophobisation of the BC. \n\n3.2 Preparation of Pickering emulsions \n\n \n\n In order to create a cellular material, the AESO monomers must be positioned at the \n\ninterface of the Pickering emulsion embedding Ac-BC fibres, hence the emulsions will be \n\nwater-in-oil (w/o) emulsions, using Ac-BC as stabiliser. Note that, although AESO was \n\nalready used in the preparation of foam materials it has never been introduced directly in \n\nthe emulsions before, instead AESO was added by long-time oil exchange procedures. \n\nThe emulsions stability is of upmost importance for the ensuing foam properties, especially \n\n\n\nAno 2015 40/59 \n\nits morphology and related mechanical performance. Therefore, prior to polymerisation \n\nreactions, we have studied the stability of water-in-AESO emulsions (Figure 3.3). The \n\nemulsions stability is obviously strongly related with the selected oil, and the ratio \n\noil/water; besides the properties of the Ac-BC.  \n\n We have studied the water-in-AESO emulsion stability, during 10 days, using \n\noptical microscopy; and also by visual inspection and measuring the volume of ejected oil. \n\nAccording to literature it can take between 3 days37 to 7 days47 to obtain a stable emulsion \n\nafter mixing the soybean oil, water and Ac-BC and shaking this mixture for 1 minute by \n\nhand, every 12 hours. Before shaking by hand, the volume of the emulsion and the volume \n\nof ejected oil were measured and when the volume stayed unchanged for several days, the \n\nemulsion was considered stable. Table 3-1 summarises the various emulsions prepared in \n\norder to study the emulsion stability. \n\nTable 3-1: Experimental data related with the study of the emulsions stability. \n\n \n\n Compounds feed \nEnsuing \n\nEmulsion \n\nEmulsion \nVwater  \n/mL \n\nVAESO \n/mL \n\nVSoybean oil \n/mL \n\nw/oa \nAc-BC (wt% \nin water)b \n\nTube \ndiameter \n\n/cm \n\n% of \ninternal \nphase  \n\nE1 20 0 20 0.5 0.2 2.7 50% \n\nE2 24 0 16 0.67 0.2 2.7 52% \n\nE3 8 8 0 0.5 0.5 2.7 63% \n\nE4 12 8 0 0.67 0.5 4.7 67% \n\nE5 10 10 0 0.5 0.5 2.7 65% \n\nE6 10 10 0 0.5 0.5 4.7 50% \na Volume ratio between the oil phase and the water phase. \n\nb Mass of Ac-BC added into the water phase, in wt% compared to the oil phase. \n\n \n\n In general, only after 3 days a stable water-in-AESO Pickering emulsion, prepared \n\nwith a feed ratio of water/AESO equal to 50/50 (V/V %) and 0.5 wt% of Ac-BC (E1, E3 \n\nand E5), was obtained. Figure 3.3 presents the average values of the tests done on the \n\nwater-in-AESO emulsions beside a picture of the stabilised emulsion in the 45 mL Falcon \n\ntube. \n\n \n\n\n\nAno 2015 41/59 \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n As we can see in Table 3-1 and Figure 3.3, the ejected oil ratio was about 60%, thus \n\nthe remaining emulsion has around 60% internal phase. We can conclude that we have \n\nindeed prepared a High Internal Phase Emulsions (HIPEs)48. This condition is primordial, \n\nas cork material has a solid fraction of 10%, this HIPEs can produce a 30 to 40% solid \n\nfraction foam. \n\n The optical microscopy imaging (Figure 3.4) allowed confirming the identity of \n\neach phase. Typical microscopy images of Figure 3.4 of the upper phase (usually called \n\nemulsion phase, visible in Figure 3.3) confirmed on the one hand that we have the \n\ncharacteristic appearance of a HIPE with micro-sized water droplets, and on the other hand \n\nthe bottom phase (ejected oil phase) have a more homogeneous with only rare and small \n\nwater and air droplets. \n\nFigure 3.3 : Evolution of the ejected oil ratio as a function of the days of shaking. On the right \n\nare two pictures of the Falcon tubes containing the emulsion E3 after one day (a) and the \n\nemulsion E5 after three days of preparation (b). \n\n\n\nAno 2015 42/59 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4: Optical microscopy images at 20 times magnification of ejected oil phase (left) and the \n\nemulsion phase (right) of the control sample E5 (50/50 water-in-AESO emulsion). \n\n \n\n Additionally, in order to have a higher surface area on the top of the reaction tube \n\nand hence, in the polymerisation step, to directly irradiate the sample in a higher surface \n\narea and, thus, to promote a more rapid and higher extension of polymerisation, \n\nstabilisation of emulsion in a larger tube (plastic cup with 150 mL) was tested. The \n\nemulsion E6, prepared in a 150 mL plastic tube, was compared to sample E5, prepared in a \n\n45 mL Falcon tube. However, stabilisation of this emulsion was not possible with such a \n\nwide surface of contact between the emulsion and the air. Non-homogeneous water phases \n\nwere obtained with a few much bigger water droplets in the emulsion. \n\n \n\n Additionally, we have also prepared water-in-soybean oil emulsions (E1 and E2) \n\nfollowing exactly the procedure described by Bismark et al.37 (Table 3-1). However, this \n\nprocedure involved a laborious step consisting of a phase-exchange from unmodified \n\nsoybean oil to AESO. Another aspect of upmost importance is that these emulsions had a \n\nlower internal phase ratio (c.a. 50%) which qualified the emulsions as medium internal \n\nphase emulsions (MIPEs),48 oppositely to the water-in-AESO (E3-6).  \n\n \n\n The E5 emulsion had a concentration of cellulose of around 1% of BC in the final \n\nproduct. Comparing this value with the 20% of cellulose in cork material, it is obvious we \n\n\n\nAno 2015 43/59 \n\nhad to find a way to increase the cellulose concentration in the final product. Table 3-2 \n\nprovides a comparison of emulsion E5 with the two emulsions prepared in order to \n\nincrease the proportion of cellulose in the final foam. \n\nTable 3-2: Comparison of E5 with E7 and E8 in order to increase the concentration of cellulose in the \n\nfoam, the expected cellulose concentration is also represented. \n\n \n\nEmulsion Compounds feed Ensuing products \n\n \nVwater  \n/mL \n\nVAESO  \n/mL \n\nVcyclohexane  \n/mL \n\nw/oa \nAc-BC (wt % \n\nin water)b \nmMCC \n\n/g  \n\n% of cellulose \nexpected in the \n\nfoam \n\nE5 10 10 0 0.5 0.5 0 0.96% \n\nE8 10 5 5 0.5 0.5 0 2% \n\nE7 10 10 0 0.5 2 1.1 10% \na Volume ratio between the oil phase and the water phase. \n\nb Mass of Ac-BC added into the water phase, in wt% compared to the oil phase. \n\n \n\n To increase the cellulose concentration in the obtained product we mixed the AESO \n\nwith cyclohexane before preparing the emulsion E8. With an oil phase composed of equal \n\nvolumes of AESO and cyclohexane, the concentration of cellulose in the final product was \n\ndoubled, i.e., it reached 2 %. Figure 3.5 presents a picture of the obtained emulsion, \n\nshowing the ejected oil at the top of the emulsion phase. \n\n This ejected oil was removed before the photo-polymerisation reaction. However, \n\nfor the water-in-AESO emulsion, removing the oil phase means putting a pipette through \n\nthe emulsion phase and this procedure was found to destabilise the emulsion. From this \n\nobservation, it was decided to perform the polymerisation with both phases and to cut out \n\nthe ejected oil phase afterwards. \n\n \n\n\n\nAno 2015 44/59 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5: Emulsion E8 of water-in-AESO/cyclohexane \n\n \n\n This new emulsion using a mixture of AESO and cyclohexane as the oil phase, in \n\norder to stabilise a higher internal phase emulsion, besides increasing the concentration of \n\nBC in the ensuing foam, also reduced the viscosity of AESO which allowed to simplify the \n\nemulsion preparation, avoiding thus the need for heating and also reducing the time needed \n\nto have a stable emulsion (around 2 days).  \n\n Another strategy was tried (E7) to increase the cellulose content in the obtained \n\nfoam. We aimed to stabilise the emulsion with as much Ac-BC as it was tried in the \n\nliterature37, i.e. 2wt% of the water phase, we added to this mixture the remaining mass of \n\nmicrocrystalline cellulose (MCC) needed to obtain an expected cellulose concentration of \n\n10%. However, we did not managed to create a stable emulsion, the introduction of MCC \n\nseems to destabilise the system. The hydrophilic microcrystalline cellulose was probably \n\nthe cause of this destabilisation. \n\n3.3 Optimisation of UV photopolymerisation of AESO  \n\n Once the conditions needed to obtain a stable emulsion were optimised, i.e. 50/50 \n\nw/o ratio with 3 days heating for water-in-AESO and 2 days rest for water-in-\n\nAESO/cyclohexane, the photopolymerisation reactions were performed. In the following \n\npart, we describe and discuss the different foams produced by UV-photoplymerisation, and \n\nhow from these observations we optimised the photopolymerisation of AESO. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 45/59 \n\n  Choosing between two lamp (different powers) and the conditions of \n\npolymerisation, four samples were polymerised. The conditions of these experiments are \n\nsummarised in the Table 3-3. \n\nTable 3-3 : Experimental data related with the four foams produced by UV photopolymerisation and \n\nexperimental conditions. \n\nFoam Emulsion \n% AESO/ \n\nCyclohexanea \n\nAct BC \n\n(wt% in \n\nwater)b \n\nCup \n\ndiameter \n\nUV Lamp \n\ncharacteristics \nObservations \n\nF1 E3 50/0 0.5 2.7 \nHg 11W \n\n?>280nm \n\nInside not \npolymerised \n\nF2 E5 50/0 0.5 2.7 \nHg 100W \n\n?>280nm \n\nAll volume \npolymerised \n\nF3 E8 25/25 0.5 2.7 \nHg 11W \n\n?>280nm \n\nInside not \npolymerised \n\nF4 E8 25/25 0.5 2.7 \nHg 100W \n\n?>280nm \n\nAll volume \npolymerised \n\na Volume ratio of AESO or cyclohexane compared to the total volume of the liquid added \n\n(water and oil phases). \n\nb Mass of Ac-BC added into the water phase, in wt% compared to the oil phase. \n\n \n\n Two mercury (?>280nm) UV lamps with different powers (11 and 100 W) were \n\nused to photo-polymerise AESO monomer into the corresponding AESO polymer49 \n\n(PPAESO). Using the 100W lamp, the ensuing foams (F2 and F4) were efficiently \n\npolymerised in all extent of its depth as confirmed by ATR FTIR. Figure 3.6 shows the \n\nFTIR spectra of F2\u2019s PPAESO of the inside and outside of the foam compared with the one \n\nof AESO monomer. The success of the polymerisation was confirmed by the strong \n\ndecrease in the intensity of the acrylate moiety related bands, the decrease of the C=C bond \n\nstretching at 1617\u20131636 cm-1; as well as the in-plane C-H deformation of C-H2 at 1406 cm\n-\n\n1 (i); and  at 810 cm-1 (ii) and 984 cm-1 (iii) the out-of-plane deformation of C-H2\n46. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 46/59 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.6 : ATR FTIR spectra of AESO monomer and ensuing PPAESO of the F2\u2019s outside (left), as \n\nwell as the ATR FTIR of the inside of the F2 foam (right). \n\n \n\n The 11 W UV-lamp been faster and easier to manipulate it was our choice for the \n\nfirst polymerisation reactions: the F1 and F3 foams. However, after the polymerisation it \n\nwas clear that the middle of the F1 foam was not polymerised. Figure 3.7 shows clearly \n\nthis problem on the picture of the foam and on the comparison of the FTIR in different part \n\nof the foam, where we can see that the double bound C=C stretching band does not \n\ndisappear in the FTIR spectra of the inside of the foam compared to the spectra of the \n\nAESO monomer. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAno 2015 47/59 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7 : FTIR spectra of the inside and outside parts of the F1 foam compared to the AESO \n\nmonomer spectra (left).  Picture of the F1 foam (right). \n\n \n\n \n\n The polymerisation of the E8 emulsion was also firstly carried out with the 11 W \n\nlamp first (foam F3). As we can see on Figure 3.8, the polymerisation of the F3 foam was \n\nnot totally successful; we can see that the inside of the sample is not well polymerised as \n\nexpected from previous results. But the material obtained is cellular and the cyclohexane \n\ndoes not evaporate under the heat of the lamp quickly enough to destabilise the emulsion. \n\nAnd we can also see on the Figure 3.8 the full polymerisation of the F4 foam using a lamp \n\nwith a higher power (100 W). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.4 Characterisation of the ensuing foams \n\n \n\n This section is focused on the analysis of foams (F2 and F4) obtained after \n\nFigure 3.8: Picture of F3 (left) after a longitudinal opening compared with the transversal cut of F4 \n\n(right). \n\n\n\nAno 2015 48/59 \n\noptimisation of the procedures previously described. Both foams were characterised using \n\nSEM imaging and thermal stability was evaluated by TGA. Dynamic Mechanical Thermal \n\nAnalysis (DMTA) was also performed to characterise the thermo-mechanical properties of \n\nthe foam. These properties are comparable to cork material and improved as we bring the \n\ncomposition of the foam closer to the one of the later. \n\n3.4.1 SEM images \n\n \n\n In Figure 3.9 two typical SEM images of F2 and F4 foams, at x60 and x30 \n\nmagnification, respectively, provide a general overview of their morphology. The SEM \n\nimages were analysed using an image analysis software, the results of the cell count and \n\nmeasurement are shown in the table 3.4. The two foams have both the internal phase ratio \n\nof a HIPE. However, the cell size of the foams varies from 410 \u00b5m for F2 to the double \n\n(881 \u00b5m) for F4. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\nTable 3-4: SEM image analysis results \n\nFoams \nMain cells average size \n\n(\u00b5m) \nStandard variation \n\n(\u00b5m) \n% of standard variation \n\nF2 410.7 198.7 0.48 \n\nF4 881.1 399.5 0.79 \n\n \n\n Note that the homogeneity of the cell size also varies, the continuous part of the F2 \n\nFigure 3.9: SEM images of foams F2 (left) and F4 (right), at x60 and x30 magnification respectively \n\n\n\nAno 2015 49/59 \n\nfoam is smoother and with less porosity than in F4 foam. Figure 3.10 represents a close-up \n\nof the continuous phase of each foams. This characteristic is also shown by the standard \n\nvariation % of the table 3-4. This difference is probably due to the evaporation of the \n\ncyclohexane from the oil phase after polymerisation of the AESO, we can also see this \n\nphenomenon on the side of the bigger cells. \n\n   \n\nFigure 3.10: x130 magnification close-up of the continuous phase of the foams F2 and F4 \n\n \n\n With a higher magnification on the side of a cell, we can see the embedding of the \n\ncellulose fibres in the matrix of the PPAESO.

Results revealed that this foam was thermally stable up to \n\n260 \u00b0C (at 5 % weight). The foam\u2019s thermogram showed a three step weight loss profile \n\ndisplaying decompositions due to both modified BC and the AESO polymer, the main \n\npeaks of this curves are listed in the Table 3-5. Starting to degrade at around 130 \u00baC and \n\nreached their first maximum decomposition between 163-168 \u00baC (at 3% weight loss), \n\nprobably due to the water release. The second degradation step of the nanocomposite \n\ncorresponded to the degradation of the AESO and began at 253 \u00b0C with a maximum at \n\n381-384 \u00b0C as well as the last observed decomposition step have a maximum at 416-420 \n\n\u00b0C, followed by a slower complete volatilization ending near 500 \u00b0C. The shift of the TGA \n\npeak at 380 \u00b0C can be explained by the presence of the Ac-BC peak at 361 \u00b0C. \n\n \n\nTable 3-5: Maximum degradation temperatures (Td,max) of AESO and F2 and F4. \n\nSamples Td,max (/\u00b0C) \n\nAESO \n \n\n388 420 \n\nAc-BC \n \n\n361 \n \n\nF2 168 384 416 \n\nF4 163 381 416 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAno 2015 51/59 \n\n \n\n \n\n In comparison with cork material50, the first degradation around 170\u00b0C for 3.85% \n\nweight loss was also measured by A. Mir and his colleagues50. Also, the degradation \n\naround 380\u00b0C, correspond to the suberin degradation measured by Gandini et all13, as well \n\nas the 80% volatilization at 470\u00b0C (427\u00b0C in our case). \n\n \n\n3.4.3 Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis \n\n \n\n DMTA analysis was performed in compression mode to investigate the mechanical \n\nproperties of the new bio-foams. Figure 3.13 displays the storage modulus vs temperature \n\nand the tan ? vs temperature curves (E\u2019 vs T and tan ? vs. T) of F2 and F4 foams. We can \n\nsee that the storage modulus of both foams decrease with increasing temperature due to the \n\nsoftening of the material. This inflection of the E\u2019 vs T plots is related with the occurrence \n\nof a relaxation process. The tan ? vs. T curves of both foams show two transitions, a first \n\nsmaller one at sub-ambient temperatures and a second broader transition at higher \n\nFigure 3.12: Thermogravimetric trace of the foam F2, showing a three step degradation profile \n\n\n\nAno 2015 52/59 \n\ntemperatures. Similar DMTA curve profiles (tan ? vs. T) were also described in literature \n\nfor cork material51,52. \n\n The tan ? vs T curve of F2 foam displays the second transition at a maximum \n\ntemperature of approximately 30 \u00b0C (f = 1 Hz), while in the case of F4 foam, it was found \n\nat much higher values, ca 60 \u00b0C (f = 1 Hz), probably due to the highest amount of Ac-BC \n\nin the latter foam. Furthermore, this transition is frequency dependent (roughly 12 oC \n\ndifference), and hence is ascribed to the glass transition temperature. \n\n \n\n \n\n The shift of the second transition temperature (from 30 \u00b0C to 62 \u00b0C) could be \n\nexplained by the increase in the crosslinking which is associated with the density decrease \n\nof AESO when mixed with cyclohexane. The full interpretation of DMTA behaviour still, \n\nhowever, needs further investigation. \n\nFigure 3.13: Storage modulus and tan ? in function of the temperature of foams F2 (Left) and F4 \n\n(Right) obtained by DMTA analysis in compression mode. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 53/59 \n\nConclusion  \n\n For such an ancient material as cork is, the multiple ways of use and applications of \n\ncork are impressive. However, only in the last decades, with the increase interest on \n\ninnovative bio-based materials for different technologies, cork has been used for other \n\napplications rather than bottle stoppers. Its properties, like hydrophobicity, thermal and \n\nacoustic isolation, high energy absorption, high friction among others, are due to cork \n\nmicrostructure and chemical architecture and these were a source of inspiration for the \n\nherein presented study. \n\n Indeed, by mimicking this rare microstructure and chemical composition, bio-based \n\nhigh performance materials were developed, specifically in this study we used \n\nnanocellulose fibrils as stabiliser of a water in an acrylated soybean oil Pickering emulsion \n\n(w/o). \n\n Novel bio-based foams, entirely based on renewable resources, were successfully \n\nproduced by environment friendly approaches based on photo-polymerising water-in-\n\nAESO emulsions. The cellular-like microstructure of these foams was confirmed with \n\nSEM imaging and it was found that cells had an average diameter ranging from 410 to 800 \n\n\u00b5m. \n\nMoreover, it was found that this microstructure, especially the pore size and density can be \n\nsimply tuned by changing the AESO/water ratio. The maximum decomposition \n\ntemperature, determined by TGA, of the ensuing foams were found to be up to 427 oC. The \n\nmechanical properties of the foams were studied by DMTA, and the glass transition value \n\nwas found to be between 30-60 oC, most probably associated with the amount of Ac-BC \n\nincorporated. \n\n Finally, a few words to highlight that the present study, carried out during this \n\nthesis, above all contributes to the development of novel biomaterials inspired by nature, \n\nfollowing the pertinent need to develop sustainable materials by eco-friendly approaches. \n\nMoreover, after this thesis, some future investigation directions were opened, representing \n\nnew and stimulating challenges. In further studies it would be interesting to compare the \n\nimpact of the degree of acetylation of BC on the stability of the emulsions and on porosity. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 54/59 \n\nAlso, another challenge is the preparation of bio-foams, incorporating lignin-like \n\nmonomers, such as DVB, which will have an impact in the foam properties, especially \n\ntheir thermal behaviour. \n\n\n\nAno 2015 55/59 \n\nAnnexe 1 : \n\nUV-Polymerisation of aromatic monomers: \n\n \n\n In order to closely mimic cork the novel biomaterial, should have in its chemical \n\ncomposition suberin-like monomers and cellulose, as the previously described foams, \n\nbesides possessing an aromatic fraction, usually associated with lignin. Indeed, lignin has a \n\nprimer importance in the structure and composition of cork material as described above in \n\nsection 1.1.4.2 in more detail. In this study several aromatic-monomers were considered to \n\nmimic lignin-monomers, namely, 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol, acetoxystyrene and \n\ndivinylbezene (DVB) (Scheme 1). Each of these monomers has an aromatic part and a \n\nvinyl group which allowed their radical polymerisation. DVB is also interesting \n\nconsidering the possibility of crosslinking while polymerising. \n\n \n\n                       \n\nScheme 1: From left to right: divinylbezene (DVB), acetoxystyrene and 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol. \n\n                   \n\n The polymerisation of DVB was carried out with three different initiators. The \n\nPDVB spectrums are represented on the Figure 1, the characteristic peaks of PDVB can be \n\nobserved. The absorption peaks at 700-750 cm\u20131 are benzene ring deformation vibrations53;  \n\nthe absorption peaks at 1500, 1600 cm\u20131 are associated with benzene ring C = C stretching \n\nvibration53 and  the aliphatic C-H stretching vibration is observed at 2920 cm\u20131 whereas \n\n3030 cm\u20131 showed the characteristic peaks of aromatic C-H stretching vibration53. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAno 2015 56/59 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Figure 1: PDVB spectra UV-polymerised with different initiators \n\n\n\nAno 2015 57/59 \n\n \n\nReferences: \n\n1.
