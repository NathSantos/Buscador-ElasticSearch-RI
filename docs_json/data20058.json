Al\u00e9m disso, os m\u00e9todos independentes de cultivo revelaram que a\nabundancia relativa e diversidade da classe Gammaproteobacteria, na qual se\ninclui o g\u00e9nero Pseudomonas, \u00e9 diferente ao longo de um gradiente estuarino\nde contamina\u00e7\u00e3o.\nDe forma a caracterizar o impacto da contamina\u00e7\u00e3o por petr\u00f3leo nas\ncomunidades microbianas sob diferentes cen\u00e1rios de altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas, um\nsistema de suporte de vida (ELSS) foi constru\u00eddo com o objectivo de realizar\nexperi\u00eancias de microcosmo. O ELSS permite simular e controlar aspectos\nfundamentais da din\u00e2mica de sistemas costeiros e estuarinos preservando os\nelementos mais representativos da comunidade bacteriana original. Com este\nsistema foi poss\u00edvel realizar uma experi\u00eancia onde o impacto independente e\ncombinado da radia\u00e7\u00e3o ultravioleta, acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1gua e contamina\u00e7\u00e3o por\npetr\u00f3leo sobre comunidades bacterianas foi determinado. O impacto na\nestrutura das comunidades foi avaliado atrav\u00e9s de pirosequencia\u00e7\u00e3o do 16S\nRNA (cDNA). A ordem Desulfobacterales sofreu uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o de abund\u00e2ncia\nrelativa muito significativa em resposta \u00e0 contamina\u00e7\u00e3o por petr\u00f3leo para uma\nredu\u00e7\u00e3o de pH estimada para 2100. Uma vez que os membros desta ordem\ndesempenham um papel crucial na degrada\u00e7\u00e3o de hidrocarbonetos de\npetr\u00f3leo, a reciclagem destes compostos em ambientes costeiros e estuarinos\npode ser alterada em cen\u00e1rios ambientais futuros. A previs\u00e3o do metagenoma\na partir da base de dados do 16S RNA indica que v\u00e1rias vias de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o\nde hidrocarbonetos de petr\u00f3leo podem ser afectadas. Os resultados obtidos\nneste trabalho acescentam novas pistas sobre o papel das bact\u00e9rias\ndegradadoras de hidrocarbonetos em ambientes costeiros e estuarinos nos\ncontextos ambientais actuais e futuro.\n\n\n\nkeywords Oil hydrocarbon bacteria, sea surface microlayer, climate change, microcosm\nexperiments\n\nabstract The ability of microorganisms to use oil hydrocarbons as a source of carbon\nand energy is crucial for environmental oil detoxification. However, there is still\na lack of knowledge on fundamental aspects of this process on specific habitats\nand under different climate scenarios.\nIn the first phase of this work, the culturable fraction of the oil hydrocarbon (OH)\ndegrading bacteria from the sea surface microlayer (SML) of the estuarine\nsystem Ria de Aveiro was characterized. In the second phase, the impact of oil\ncontamination on the active bacterial community was studied under climate\nchange scenarios. Pseudomonas emerged as the prevailing genera among OH\ndegrading bacteria in the SML. Moreover, culture-independent methods\nrevealed that the relative abundance and diversity of Gammaproteobacteria, in\nwhich Pseudomonas is included, varies along an estuarine gradient of\ncontamination.\nIn order to access the impact of oil contamination on microbial communities\nunder climate change scenarios, an experimental life support system for\nmicrocosm experiments (ELLS) was developed and validated for simulation of\nclimate change effects on microbial communities. With the ELSS it is possible\nto simulate, in controlled conditions, fundamental parameters of the dynamics\nof coastal and estuarine systems while maintaining community structure in\nterms of the abundance of the most relevant members of the indigenous\nbacterial community. A microcosm experiment in which the independent and\ncombined impact of ultraviolet radiation, ocean acidification and oil\ncontamination on microbial communities was conducted. The impact on\nbacterial communities was accessed with a 16S RNA (cDNA) based barcode\npyrosequencing approach. There was a drastic decrease of Desulfobacterales\nrelative abundance after oil contamination under the reduced pH value\nestimated for 2100, when compared to present values. Since members of this\norder are known OH degraders, such a significant decrease may have\nconsequences on OH detoxification of contaminated environments under the\npH levels of the ocean expected for the future. Metagenome predictions based\non the 16S RNA database indicated that several degradation pathways of OH\ncould be affected under oil contamination and reduced water pH. Taken\ntogether, the results from this work bring new information on the dynamics of\nOH degrading bacteria in coastal and estuarine environments under present\nand future climate scenarios.\n\n\n\nvii\n\nContents\n\nJustification, objectives and thesis outline 1\n\nChapter I 5\nIntroduction 7\n\nMicrobial degradation of oil hydrocarbons 7\n\nInteractions between climate change and anthropogenic pollution 8\n\nOcean acidification and UVR interactions with marine microbial communities \u2013 what we know\n\nso far 10\nEffects of ocean acidification in marine microbial communities 10\n\nEffects of UVR in marine microbial communities 12\n\nInteractions between climate change, oil pollution and microbial communities 14\n\nMicrocosm coupled with molecular biology techniques as a study tool 17\n\nLiterature cited 20\n\nChapter II 27\nExploring hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in the estuarine surface microlayer 29\n\nIntroduction 29\n\nMaterials and Methods 31\nStudy site and sampling 31\n\nEnrichment and isolation of PAH-degrading bacteria 32\n\nResults and discussion 35\nPhysical and chemical parameters 35\n\nPAH-degrading isolates: characterization of isolates 36\n\nPAH-degrading isolates: detection of dioxygenase genes 37\n\nThe effect of sampling site on the community structure of the bacterioneuston 40\nWhole-community and Pseudomonas structural diversity 40\n\nMicrobial abundance overall and in the Gammaproteobacteria 43\n\nConclusions 44\n\nLiterature cited 45\n\nChapter III 51\nDevelopment and validation of an experimental life support system for assessing the effects\nof global climate change and environmental contamination on estuarine and coastal marine\nbenthic communities 53\n\nIntroduction 54\n\nMethods 55\n\n\n\nviii\n\nELSS basic architecture 55\nTidal cycle and water circulation control system 57\n\npH control system 57\n\nTemperature control system 58\n\nLighting control system 58\n\nWater chemistry analysis 59\n\nBiological validation 59\nSediment sampling 59\n\nExperimental validation parameters 60\n\nProfiling of the active bacterial community 61\n\nRNA extraction, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and pyrosequencing 61\n\nHediste diversicolor stocking in microcosms 62\n\nInvertebrate collection 63\n\nBiochemical parameters 63\n\nResults and discussion 64\nWater nutrient validation 64\n\nBiological validation 65\n\nSediment bacterial diversity 65\n\nHediste diversicolor biochemical parameters 69\n\nExperimental life support system applications 71\n\nAcknowledgment 72\n\nLiterature cited 73\n\nSupporting information 79\nMethods 80\n\nSystems basic architecture 80\n\nArtificial life support system detail schemes 81\n\nLighting system 88\n\npH control system 91\n\nCollection of invertebrates and microcosm exposure 91\n\nValidation of inorganic nutrient concentration in water 93\n\nProfilling of the active bacterial community 95\n\n16S rRNA sequence analysis 95\n\nLiterature cited 101\n\nChapter IV 103\nOcean acidification and oil contamination have a synergistic effect on microbial\ncommunity composition 105\n\nIntroduction 105\n\n\n\nix\n\nMethods 107\nAromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon analysis 107\n\nActive bacterial community profiling 107\n\nSequence Analysis 108\n\nResults and discussion 109\nSample Collection and Experimental Manipulation 110\n\nActive bacterial community 111\n\nPredicted metagenome analysis 114\n\nConclusions 116\n\nAcknowledgment 116\n\nLiterature cited 117\n\nSupporting information 121\nHydrocarbon analysis 121\n\nWater acidification 125\n\nLighting system 127\n\nLiterature cited 137\n\nChapter V 139\nDiscussion and conclusions 141\n\nExperimental design and methodological considerations 141\n\nFrom field work to microcosm experiments 141\n\nConsiderations on climate change and oil spill microcosms experiment 142\n\nMicrobial communities and oil hydrocarbon degradation in estuarine environments \u2013 main\n\nconclusions and unanswered questions 144\n\nLiterature cited 146\n\nAppendix 149\nInteractive effects of global climate change and pollution on marine microbes: the way\nahead 151\n\nIntroduction 151\n\nOcean acidification and UVR interactions with marine microbial communities \u2013 what we know\n\nso far 153\n\nEffects of UVR in marine microbial communities 155\n\nSynergistic effect of UVR, ocean acidification and anthropogenic pollutants 157\nWill interactions between UVR, ocean acidification and anthropogenic pollutants affect marine\n\nmicrobes? 157\n\nMicrobial mediated detoxification 159\n\nMicrocosm coupled with molecular biology technologies as an experimental framework 160\n\n\n\nx\n\nConcluding remarks 165\n\nAcknowledgements 166\n\nLiterature cited 166\n\nLiterature cited 173\nLiterature cited 175\n\n\n\nxi\n\nList of publications\n\nChapter II - Coelho F.J.R.C., Sousa S., Santos L., Santos A.L., Almeida A., Gomes N.C.M.,\nCunha A.

The environmental importance of this process is such that the\n\nworld\u00b4s ocean would be literally covered with oil, if bacteria were not catabolising these\n\ncompounds (Head et al., 2006). The ability of bacteria to use petroleum hydrocarbons as\n\nenergy and carbon source has been studied in detail (Bamforth et al., 2005). However there is\n\nstill a lack of knowledge on fundamental aspects of this process in specific habitats and under\n\ndifferent environmental scenarios. For example, although the sea surface microlayer (SML)\n\ncovers almost 70% of the earth surface and oil hydrocarbons tends to concentrate there (Wurl\n\net al., 2004), little is known about the structure of the hydrocarbon degrading bacterial\n\ncommunity inhabiting this particular water compartment.\n\nConcurrently, the impact of climate change scenarios, such as ocean acidification and\n\nincrease ultraviolet radiation (UVR), on microbial interactions with oil hydrocarbons is not\n\nknown. Ocean acidification and UVR have the potential to significantly impact microbial\n\ncommunity structure and function. Among other effects, modifications can impact microbial\n\nmediated detoxification processes, with unpredictable effects on metabolic pathways and\n\ntoxicity of anthropogenic pollutants.\n\nThere is an urgent need for a mechanistic understanding of the complex interactions\n\ninvolving bacteria, pollutants and climate factors. This knowledge can ultimately lead to more\n\naccurate predictions of shifts in microbial communities and in pollutant toxicity under climate\n\nchange scenarios and to the development of new microbial-based remediation technologies.\n\nHowever, the complexity of biological, chemical and environmental interactions in natural\n\nenvironments restricts our ability to establish cause-effect relationships. Understanding the\n\ninteractions of global climate change and pollutants on living organisms is a complex task that\n\nentails the study of a multitude of interactions. This demands innovative and statistically\n\nrobust experiments conducted under controlled conditions during which biological and non-\n\nbiological markers of environmental function can be identified and measured.\n\nThe general objective of this work was to gain fundamental knowledge on the\n\ninteractions of microbial communities with oil hydrocarbon pollutants in marine\n\nenvironments. First, from a phenomenological perspective, the hydrocarbon degrading\n\n\n\nJustification, objectives and thesis outline\n\n2\n\nmicrobial communities were characterized in a model environment. Second, from a more\n\nmechanistic view, the effects of a crude oil spill in the microbial communities of estuarine\n\nsediment were assessed under controlled climate change scenarios.\n\nThree specific objectives were formulated in order to accomplish the general objective:\n\nTo characterize the hydrocarbon degrading bacteria of the sea surface microlayer in a\n\nchronically oil polluted estuarine system;\n\nTo develop an innovative framework that would enable statistically robust microcosm\n\nsimulations of climate change scenarios in marine environments;\n\nTo characterize the synergistic effects between ocean acidification, ultraviolet radiation and\n\nanthropogenic pollutants on microbial communities.\n\nIn Chapter 1 a brief introduction that focus the relevance of oil hydrocarbon bacterial\ndegradation and the current knowledge on the effects of climate change and anthropogenic\n\npollution interactions on microbial communities is presented.\n\nChapter 2 addresses objective 1 by examining for the first time the oil hydrocarbon\ndegrading bacteria in a estuarine surface microlayer. Pseudomonas was the dominant group\n\namong the culturable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degrading bacteria. Screening\n\nfor specific genes involved in PAH degradation revealed that identical genes were present in\n\ntwo phylogenetically distinct isolates, thus suggesting that horizontal transfer of genes might\n\nbe fundamental in PAH degradation in the SML. Culture-independent analysis revealed that\n\nalthough the general structure of the bacterial community remains unchanged along a\n\ncontamination gradient, the relative abundance and diversity of organisms of The\n\nGammaproteobacteria group, including those of the genus Pseudomonas, reveals differences. These\n\nfindings highlight the importance of SML-adapted oil hydrocarbon degrading bacteria with\n\npotential use in bioremediation of polluted ecosystems. This chapter was published in the\n\njournal Aquatic and Microbial Ecology.\nChapter 3 describes the architecture and validation of a microcosm framework\n\ndesigned to study the interactive effects of climate change and anthropogenic pollution on\n\nmarine benthic communities. This chapter addresses objective 2. This system, named\n\nexperimental life support system (ELSS), allows simulating climate change scenarios under\n\nhigh controlled conditions. In this chapter, the validation of the reproducibility and\n\n\n\nJustification, objectives and thesis outline\n\n3\n\nenvironmental quality of this system was achieved by comparing chemical and biological\n\nparameters recorded in the ELSS with those prevalent in the natural environment. Average\n\nconcentration of inorganic nutrients remained stable during ELSS functioning. Although\n\nsome shifts in bacterial community composition were observed between in situ and ELSS\n\nsediment samples, the relative abundance of the most abundant metabolically active bacterial\n\ntaxa was stable. In addition, ELSS operation did not affect survival, oxidative stress and\n\nneurological biomarkers of the model organism Hedistes diversicolor. The validation data thus\n\nsupports the use of this system to address objective 3. This chapter was published as a\n\ntechnical advance in the journal Global Change Biology, ranked third (following Nature and\nScience) in the list of the most-cited journals in climate change research.\n\nChapter 4 addresses objective 3 by examining the interactive effects of ocean\nacidification and ultraviolet radiation in estuarine sediment microbial communities. The effects\n\non the active bacterial community were characterized by using a barcoded pyrosequencing\n\napproach of the 16S rRNA (cDNA). The most drastic change detected was a reduction in\n\nanaerobic sulphate reducing bacteria under oil contamination and reduced pH values. Given\n\nthe role of sulphate reducing bacteria in anaerobic oil hydrocarbon degradation we used\n\nPICRUSTs to predict the community metagenome and on focused specific contaminant\n\ndegradation pathways. The predicted metagenomes revealed that under oil contamination and\n\nreduced pH, several contaminant degradation pathways were affected. These results suggest\n\nthat in future ocean reduced pH conditions the impact of an oil spill can be substantially\n\ndifferent than under current pH levels.\n\nChapter 5 discusses the experimental design and the main conclusions.

Natural seepage alone\n\nintroduces about 600000 metric tons of natural crude oil per year in our oceans representing\n\n47% of crude oil entering the marine environment. The remaining 53% results from\n\nanthropogenic activities (accidental oil spills, transport activities, refining, storage, and others)\n\n(Kvenvolden et al., 2003).\n\nCrude oils are complex mixtures of many different hydrocarbons and organic\n\nmolecules. Petroleum components, for example, can be classified by thin-layer\n\nchromatography as saturate, aromatic, resins and asphaltenes (Garrett et al., 1998). The\n\nsaturated fraction includes the linear and branched chain alkanes and cycloalkanes, while the\n\naromatic fraction consists of the aromatic mono- or polycyclic compounds (Garrett et al.,\n\n1998)\n\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are among the most common compounds\n\nassociated to OH pollution and probably the most recalcitrant and therefore categorized as\n\nPOPs. They are widespread in soil, water and air and are known to be genotoxic, carcinogenic\n\nand susceptible to bioaccumulation (Newsted et al., 1987). The solubility of these pollutants is\n\ngenerally low and decreases as the molecular weight increases. Due to their chemical\n\ncharacteristics, PAH tend to adsorb to solid particles such as soils and sediments, or to\n\nconcentrate at the SML (Wurl et al., 2004, Zhou et al., 2009). Very often, adorption contributes\n\nto their stability and persistence in the environment.\n\nMicroorganisms have developed the ability to metabolize or degrade oil hydrocarbons\n\nas a source of energy and carbon. The oil-catabolic versatility of marine microorganisms,\n\nespecially bacteria, is such that the world\u00b4s oceans would be literally covered with a layer of oil\n\nif bacteria could not metabolize these compounds (Head et al., 2006). Hydrocarbonoclastic\n\n(OH degraders) bacteria can be found in marine ecosystems in the SML, in underlying water\n\nand in sediments. Several marine bacteria capable of metabolizing petroleum hydrocarbons,\n\nnamely Alcalinovorax (Yakimov et al., 1972) Cycloclasticus (Dyksterhouse et al., 1995), Oleiphilus\n\n(Golyshin et al., 2002) and Oleispira (Yakimov, 2003) have been isolated from marine\n\nenvironments. Commonly, these organisms are found in low abundance in pristine\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n8\n\nenvironments and in areas exposed to low levels of OH pollution, but they can rapidly\n\nrespond to OH contamination with an increase in biomass and activity (Gomes et al., 2005,\n\nYakimov et al., 2005). Information on the ecology and physiology of in situ PAH detoxification\n\nis largely available in the scientific literature, which supports a fairly extensive understanding\n\non the process of environmental PAH detoxification (Kasai et al., 2002, Ro et al., 2002, Head et\n\nal., 2006, Gomes et al., 2007). The metabolic pathways and enzymatic reactions involved in the\n\nmicrobial aerobic degradation of naphthalene have been studied in detail. The basis of these\n\nmechanisms is the oxidation of the PAH aromatic ring by the action of dioxygenase enzymes,\n\nfollowed by the systematic breakdown into PAH metabolites and CO2 (Bamforth et al., 2005).\n\nAnaerobic degradation of PAH occurs at lower rates, but it might play an essential role in the\n\nlong-term detoxification of soil and sediments (Zhang et al., 2011). The hydrocarbonoclastic\n\nbacteria are important players in environmental OH detoxification through a complex process\n\nin which environmental factors and biological activities interact. Also, it may involve the\n\nsynergistic contribution of enzymatic pathways operated by several other functional groups\n\nrather than exclusively assigned to OH-degrading populations (Head et al., 2006).\n\nInteractions between climate change and anthropogenic pollution\n\nAtmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), mainly through the burning of\n\nfossil fuels, have increased from approximately 280 ppmv (parts per million volume) in\n\npreindustrial times (Inderm\u00fchle et al., 1999) to nearly 394 ppmv in 2012 (NOAA Earth System\n\nResearch Laboratory, 2012). The postulated impact of elevated CO2 levels on the earth's\n\ntemperature is only one, although probably the best known, of the consequences of the\n\nincreased CO2 concentrations. Increased atmospheric CO2 also causes a net air-to-sea flux of\n\nCO2, reducing seawater pH and inducing modifications in the chemical balance between\n\ninorganic carbon species. This process, known as ocean acidification, is often referred to as\n\n\u201cthe other CO2 problem\u201d (Doney et al., 2009, Doney, 2010). Since ocean acidification is a\n\ndirect consequence of the increase of the partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere, it does\n\nnot depend on uncertainties related with other climate change predictions (Doney et al., 2009).\n\nAlthough international treaties have been effective in reducing atmospheric\n\nconcentrations of ozone depleting substances (UNEP, 2012), increased concentrations of\n\ngreenhouse gases have the potential to affect the spatial distribution of ozone and its exchange\n\nbetween the stratosphere and the troposphere. This, in turn, will impact ultraviolet radiation\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\n(UVR) levels reaching the earth\u2019s surface (Bais et al., 2011). Global warming, ocean\n\nacidification and changes in oceanic stratification patterns, are also expected to increase the\n\npenetration of UV radiation in the water column and enhance the exposure of aquatic\n\norganisms to UV-B in the future (UNEP, 2010). Importantly, increased UVR has been shown\n\nto disrupt aquatic food webs and reduce the biological sinking capacity of atmospheric CO2\n(Hader et al., 2007, Fabry et al., 2008).\n\nAnthropogenic activities have been seriously and adversely affecting marine\n\necosystems for decades with a continuous influx of pollutants including oil hydrocarbons\n\n(OH), pesticides and heavy metals (Doney, 2010). Ocean acidification and UVR have the\n\npotential to interact synergistically with a range of natural organic compounds and\n\nenvironmental pollutants, with deleterious effects on oceanic ecosystems. An alert on the\n\npossibility that ocean acidification in synergy with anthropogenic stressors could lead to\n\nwidespread changes in marine ecosystems was recently sent (Fabry et al., 2008). However, the\n\nexact nature of such changes was not discussed.\n\nFigure I-1: Interactions between ultraviolet radiation, ocean acidification, anthropogenic pollution and microbial\ncommunities. Climate change has the potential to influence pollutant toxicity by acting directly on pollutant\nchemistry or indirectly by affecting microbial mediated detoxification. Both have the potential to act\n\nsynergistically on microbial communities and possible on microbial mediated processes.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n10\n\nDespite the important role microbial assemblages play in the global recycling of\n\nanthropogenic pollutants, the potential interactive effects of UVR, ocean acidification and\n\nanthropogenic pollutants on marine microbial communities have been largely ignored. Little is\n\nknown about how pollutant pathways may change under different climate change scenarios\n\nand how this will affect biogeochemical cycling. Moreover, although microbial assemblages\n\nhave been shown to be affected by increased UVR and ocean acidification, nothing is known\n\nabout how these changes will affect pollutant toxicity (Figure I-1).\n\nOcean acidification and UVR interactions with marine microbial communities \u2013 what\nwe know so far\n\nEffects of ocean acidification in marine microbial communities\n\nOceanic pH has declined by 0.1 units from pre-industrial times to present (IPCC,\n\n2007). Under unabated CO2 emissions, pH will further decline 0.3 to 0.4 units by the end of\n\nthis century, and up to 0.7 units in 2300 (Caldeira et al., 2003). When CO2 dissolves in\n\nseawater, carbonic acid (H2CO3) is formed. It quickly dissociates into a hydrogen ion (H\n+) and\n\na bicarbonate ion (HCO3\n-). The hydrogen ion can then react with the carbonate ion (CO2\n\n-3) to\n\nform bicarbonate. This process leads to increased partial pressure (pCO2), increased\n\nconcentrations of H2CO3, HCO\n-\n3, and H\n\n+, and reduced concentrations of CO3\n-2 (Fabry et al.,\n\n2008).\n\nThe predicted reduction in carbonate ions has led to several studies of marine\n\norganisms such as corals, mollusks, echinoderms and crustaceans, that depend on the\n\navailability of CO3\n-2 to form biogenic calcium carbonate to produce shells and skeletons\n\n(Fabry et al., 2008). Similar studies on how functionally important marine microbes will\n\nrespond to ocean acidification are, however, lacking.\n\nRecently, Joint et al. (2011) suggested that given that microbial assemblages have\n\nalways experienced variable pH conditions, the appropriate null hypothesis to be tested is that\n\n\u201cthere will be no catastrophic changes in marine biogeochemical processes driven by\n\nphytoplankton, bacteria and archaea\u201d (Joint et al., 2011). Liu et al. (2010), however, performed\n\na meta-analysis of published data and suggested that this hypothesis should be rejected (Liu et\n\nal., 2010). Although few and far from consistent, studies on the impacts of ocean acidification\n\non marine microbial communities include changes to primary production rates, phytoplankton\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\ncommunity structure, the nitrogen cycle and the structure and activity of bacterial\n\ncommunities (IPCC, 2011).\n\nMost marine primary producers show little or no change in photosynthetic rates when\n\ngrown under increased pCO2 (Doney et al., 2009). This appears to be related to the\n\npredominant phytoplankton species. In a mesocosm experiment, a phytoplankton community\n\ndominated by the coccolithophore Emiliana Huxley, increased CO2 uptake by up to 39% under\n\nincreased pCO2 levels (Riebesell et al., 2007). The CO2 consumption was not balanced by\n\nincreases in particulate organic carbon (POC). Instead, it was rapidly converted to DOC and\n\nTEPs, and any additional carbon incorporation into POC was lost from surface to deep\n\nwaters. These results suggest that increased atmospheric pCO2 may lead to increased particle\n\nflux from surface to deep water, potentially providing a negative feedback to increased CO2\nemissions (Arrigo, 2007, Riebesell et al., 2007).\n\nPhytoplankton responses to increased pCO2 depend to a large extent, on inorganic\n\ncarbon-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) operated by cells (Gattuso et al., 2011). Marine\n\nprimary producers include phylogenetically diverse groups that differ in their photosynthetic\n\napparatus and CCMs. These differences are likely to alter competitive relationships among\n\nphytoplankton and induce shifts in plankton species composition as oceanic pCO2 increases\n\n(Gattuso et al., 2011).\n\nIncreased concentrations of CO2 may also affect the nitrogen cycle. The filamentous\n\ncyanobacterium Trichodesmium, a major contributor of new nitrogen in oligotrophic oceans,\n\nincreased carbon and nitrogen fixation rates by 35-100% at predicted pCO2 scenarios of the\n\nyear 2100 when compared to present day pCO2 conditions (Hutchins et al., 2007). In contrast,\n\na negative impact of high pCO2 was observed for Nodularia spumigena. These contradictory\n\nresults may be related to different ecological strategies of non-heterocystous (Trichodesmium)\n\nand heterocystous (Nodularia) cyanobacteria (Czerny et al., 2009).\n\nIn addition to nitrogen fixation, other processes of the nitrogen cycle may be altered\n\nby ocean acidification. It has been suggested that ocean acidification can reduce nitrification\n\nrates by 3-44% within the next few decades (Beman et al., 2010). A few studies have addressed\n\neffects of elevated pCO2 on bacterial abundance and community structure coupled to\n\nphytoplankton dynamics. Abundance of bacteria varied considerably in nitrate and phosphate\n\ninduced phytoplankton blooms. However, the effect of CO2 on bacterial abundance could not\n\nbe demonstrated (Grossart et al., 2006, Allgaier et al., 2008). The structure of communities of\n\nfree living bacteria demonstrated significant changes under increased pCO2, but this effect was\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n12\n\nnot detected in the attached fraction, that correlated more strongly with phytoplankton\n\ndevelopment (Allgaier et al., 2008). Increased pCO2 can also affect bacterial extracellular\n\nenzymatic activity and secondary biomass production. Protease activity was reported to be\n\nhighest at elevated pCO2 level (Grossart et al., 2006). Piontek et al. (2010) found higher ? and\n\n?-glucosidase in enhanced pCO2 conditions, suggesting that in these circunstances, polymer\n\nhydrolysis may be diverted towards polysaccharide degradation. Polysaccharide-based\n\ndissolved organic matter (DOM) could inhibit the biological carbon pump, resulting in a\n\npositive feedback on CO2 emissions (Piontek et al., 2010). Bacteria production was found to\n\nbe higher (Grossart et al., 2006) or unchanged under future pCO2 scenarios (Allgaier et al.,\n\n2008).\n\nIn summary, although the underlying mechanisms of increase pCO2 effects are not yet\n\nfully understood, the current knowledge suggests that increased pCO2 levels will affect the\n\nstructure of microbial communities and rates of several microbial mediated processes.\n\nEffects of UVR in marine microbial communities\n\nResearch on increase UVR implications was stimulated 30 years ago by the realization\n\nthat with the stratospheric ozone layer in danger due to anthropogenic chlorofluorocarbons\n\nemissions, there would be an increase in UV-B radiation. Since then, mainly due to the\n\nimplementation of the Montreal protocol that successfully reduced ozone-depleting\n\nsubstances, the ozone levels in the atmosphere are no longer declining (Mckenzie et al., 2011).\n\nHowever, the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases are expected to interact with\n\nozone and alter its spatial distribution and exchanges between the stratosphere and\n\ntroposphere, with potential effects on UVR levels that reach the earth (Bais et al., 2011).\n\nThe amount of UVR that reaches the earth surface has direct consequences to aquatic\n\necosystems. The UVR component of incident solar radiation is the most photochemically\n\nreactive waveband of incident radiation, being able to penetrate to considerable depths in\n\naquatic ecosystems, with potential genotoxic, cytotoxic and ontogenetic effects in aquatic\n\norganisms (Bancroft et al., 2007). UVR can be divided in three wavelength ranges: UV-A (320-\n\n400 nm), UV-B (290-320 nm) and UV-C (<290 nm).  Since DNA absorbs only weakly at\n\nlonger UV wavelengths (Jones et al., 1987, Wells et al., 1984) the detrimental effects of UV-A\n\nare usually considered to be mostly indirect, resulting from intracellular generation of ROS,\n\nsuch as oxidative damage to lipids, proteins and DNA (Pattison et al., 2006). UV-C\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nwavelengths are almost completely screened out of the atmosphere by oxygen and ozone,\n\ntherefore they are generally not considered as environmentally relevant. UV-B is the highest\n\nenergy wavelength of solar radiation that reaches the Earth\u2019s surface and the UV wavelength\n\nmost affected by changes in the ozone layer (Andersen et al., 2002). The UV-B radiation is the\n\nmost relevant of the UV spectrum, since it can cause damage to nearly all biomolecules by\n\ndirect absorption or indirectly as a result of enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species\n\n(Vincent et al., 2000).\n\nIn the natural environment, effects of UV-B radiation are generally attenuated by\n\nprotection strategies such as avoidance, photochemical quenching and repair (Vincent et al.,\n\n2000). The overall stress imposed by UVR exposure reflects a balance between damage, repair\n\nand the energetic costs of protection, and may affect energy consumption and biochemical\n\ncomposition of cellular material, shifting survival and growth rates (Vincent et al., 2000). Due\n\nto short generation times, simple haploid genomes with little or no functional redundancy and\n\nsmall size, UVR represents an important stressor for microorganisms in aquatic ecosystems\n\n(Garcia-Pichel, 1994). Exposure to UV-B radiation results in a general decrease in bacterial\n\nabundance (Herndl et al., 1993, Santos et al., 2012). Effects of UV-B radiation on bacterial\n\ncommunity composition have been observed, which could have implications to the\n\nbiogeochemical impact of enhanced UVR levels on ecosystems. For example, evidences have\n\nbeen found that Alphaproteobacteria populations sensitive to UVR are responsible for a large\n\npart of low-molecular-weight DOM uptake, while the more UVR-resistant Bacteroidetes, tend to\n\nbe specialized in high-molecular-weight DOM uptake (Alonso-S\u00e1ez et al., 2006, Cottrell et al.,\n\n2000). This suggests that changes in bacterial community due to UVR pressure could lead to\n\nshifts in the pathways of DOM (Morris et al., 2002).\n\nIn general, exposure to UV-B also decreases extracellular enzymatic activities (Herndl\n\net al., 1993, Miiller-niklasl et al., 1995, Santos et al., 2011a), oxygen consumption (Pakulski et al.,\n\n1998), leucine and thymidine incorporation (Sommaruga et al., 1997, Santos et al., 2012), and\n\ninduce shifts in carbon source use profiles by bacteria (Santos et al., 2012). This can also affect\n\nDOM utilization in aquatic ecosystems quantitatively and qualitatively. However, results are\n\nsometimes contradictory between studies and vary even between bacterial isolates tested in a\n\nparticular study (Fern\u00e1ndez Zenoff et al., 2006, Santos et al., 2011b). Furthermore, stimulatory\n\neffects of UVR exposure on bacterial activity have also been reported as a result of\n\nphototransformation of organic matter (Pakulski et al., 2007).\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n14\n\nUVR can also affect microorganisms indirectly. Bacteria, viruses, phytoplankton and\n\nbacterivores interact closely, and therefore, if one group of organisms is directly impacted by\n\nUVR (e.g., due to DNA damage) this will indirectly affect carbon flow through the other\n\ngroups (Vincent et al., 2000). Effects of UVR on bacteria can also be influenced by the\n\nphotochemical alteration of the bioavailability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The\n\nirradiation of DOC can result in the production of low-molecular weight (LMW) compounds\n\nthat are easily taken up by bacteria and used for growth, as well as more refractory products\n\nand ROS which might exert an overall inhibitory effect (Kieber, 2000).\n\nDepending on the environmental properties (physical, chemical and biological) of the\n\nwater body studied, UVR can exert a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on bacterial metabolism.\n\nHowever, most studies agree on the potential of UVR to alter the efficiency with which\n\ndissolved organic matter is transformed into bacterial biomass and thus affect the carbon\n\ncycle.\n\nInteractions between climate change, oil pollution and microbial communities\n\nDespite the fact that several studies have already shown that physical and chemical\n\nparameters directly affect the toxicity of anthropogenic pollutants, the synergistic effects of\n\nUVR and ocean acidification on the chemistry of these pollutants and their effects on marine\n\nmicrobial communities have received very little attention. Increased levels of UVR and\n\nchanges in ocean pH levels will certainly affect the chemical structure of several natural\n\ncompounds and environmental pollutants, affecting the way that they interact with marine\n\norganisms.\n\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are, due to their highly conjugated ?-orbital\n\nsystems, ideal examples of photoactive contaminants that strongly absorb in the UV-B and\n\nUV-A spectral regions (Krylov et al., 1997). It is known that the toxicity of PAH to marine\n\norganisms increases with exposure to UVR (Krylov et al., 1997, McConkey et al., 1997,\n\nPelletier et al., 2006, Petersen et al., 2007). This increase is largely regulated by\n\nphotosensitization and photooxidation reactions. Photosensitization begins with the\n\nsensitizing molecule absorbing a photon, which elevates it to an excited singlet state. From\n\nthere, the molecule can be transformed to the excited triplet state, where it can react with\n\nground triplet-state oxygen to form singlet oxygen. Singlet oxygen is capable of oxygenating or\n\noxidizing a wide range of biomolecules, with potentially lethal effects to a wide range of\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\norganisms (Krylov et al., 1997). Photomodification (photooxidation) occurs due to the\n\nabsorption of photon energy at 280\u2013400 nm (UVR) by the aromatic molecules, which leads to\n\nthe formation of new compounds. This process releases phototoxic aromatic hydrocarbons\n\ninto the environment, which are more toxic than their parent compounds (Krylov et al., 1997,\n\nMcConkey et al., 1997, Peachey, 2005, Sargian et al., 2006, Petersen et al., 2007).\n\nReduced seawater pH has the potential to affect the adsorption of metals by organic\n\nparticles. Generally, organic particles are negatively charged and, as pH declines, surface sites\n\nbecome less available to adsorb positive charges like metals. This is particularly important\n\nbecause more than 99% of the total concentrations of many metals in seawater are in organic\n\ncomplexes (Doney et al., 2009, Millero et al., 2009). A small deviation in the concentration of\n\nelements like Cu and Cd can result in toxic effects to marine organisms (Millero et al., 2009),\n\nincluding microorganisms. However, organic materials are often nonhomogeneous and have\n\nunknown structures, so the speciation of metals in organic complexes is not as well\n\ncharacterized as is the case with inorganic ligands (Doney et al., 2009, Millero et al., 2009)\n\nStudies have already found evidences of synergistic interactions between climate\n\nchange and anthropogenic pollutants. For example, the exposure to PAH and UVR\n\ntreatments independently had no significant effects on larval crab mortality but the combined\n\nexposure caused an increase in mortality of up to 100% when compared to the independent\n\ntreatments (Peachey, 2005). Photoenhanced toxicity of PAH due to UVR exposure has been\n\nobserved in a variety of organisms, such as algae (Marwood et al., 1999) and crustaceans\n\n(Nikkil\u00e4 et al., 1999, Peachey, 2005) and plants (Huang et al., 1997). This phenomenon, has\n\nalso been reported for isolated bacterial strains such as Photobacterium phosphoreum (McConkey\n\net al., 1997) and Vibrio fisheri (El-Alawi et al., 2001). However, only few studies have addressed\n\nthe effect of UVR photo-modified pollutants in complex microbial assemblages.\n\nIn a microcosm experiment designed to study the effects of increased UV-B in the\n\npresence of the water-soluble fraction of crude oil, an increase in mortality was observed in\n\nthe phytoplankton community in UV-B exposed microcosm. Bacterial growth was found to\n\nincrease, which the authors related with organic matter release due to toxicity effects on\n\nphytoplankton (Pelletier et al., 2006). More recently, a similar effect was observed in sediment\n\nmicrocosms (Petersen et al., 2008). Algal 14C-incorporation and chlorophyll a content in\n\nsediments exposed to UV-light and pyrene was found to decrease when compared to sole\n\npyrene treatments. Concurrently, increase O consumption and increase release of N and P was\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n16\n\ndetected, suggesting an increase in bacterial activity (Petersen et al., 2008). Both of these\n\nstudies suggest that PAH phototoxicity may be relevant to microbial communities.\n\nFabry et al. (2008) suggested that altered water CO2 chemistry in synergy with other\n\nenvironmental stressors may modify organismal and even ecosystem responses to these\n\nstressors in ways that differ substantially from the action of only a single stressor (Fabry et al.,\n\n2008).  There have, however, been no studies on the toxicity of PAH and other persistent\n\norganic pollutants under increased pCO2 scenarios on marine microorganisms.\n\nAn important question that we need to answer thus is whether ocean acidification and\n\nUVR will affect microbial communities in such a way as to alter microbial mediated\n\ndetoxification of anthropogenic pollutants. In addition to directly measurable physiological\n\neffects on marine microbes, UVR and ocean acidification can also exert indirect effects on the\n\ntoxicity of anthropogenic pollutants by inducing shifts in microbial community structure; they\n\ncan also alter microbial mediated detoxification processes. For example, the bioavailability of\n\ninorganic nutrients required for bacterial growth, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, are key\n\nfactors in successful ecosystem detoxification of PAH (Atlas et al., 1972). Any factor likely to\n\nalter the nitrogen cycle, such as ocean acidification, has therefore the potential to alter\n\nmicrobial mediated PAH detoxification processes and consequently PAH toxicity.\n\nAnother potential effect of elevated UVR levels and ocean acidification is an alteration\n\nof metal bioavailability. Metals interact with microorganisms in various ways, and are involved\n\nin virtually all aspects of microbial growth and metabolism (Gadd, 2010). Changes in iron\n\nchemistry are particularly important, given that iron is a limiting nutrient for marine\n\nphytoplankton in large oceanic regions (Shi et al., 2010). Although iron is the fourth most\n\nabundant element in the Earth\u00b4s crust, it is present in very low concentrations in oceanic\n\nwater (Ducklow et al., 2003). This is partially due to the low solubility of Fe (III), the\n\nthermodynamically stable redox form of iron (Sunda, 2010).  Recently, it was reported that the\n\npCO2 level for the year 2100 would reduce iron uptake by diatoms and coccolithophores by 10\n\nto 20% (Shi et al. 2010). The reduction in iron availability is believed to be related to pH\n\ninduced binding of iron to organic ligands, thus reducing biologically available Fe(III) (Sunda,\n\n2010, Shi et al., 2010). However, the net effect of ocean acidification is still unclear. For\n\nexample, although lower pH increases iron binding to organic ligands, the solubility of Fe(III)\n\nincreases with water acidification (Millero et al., 2009). Moreover, increased organic binding\n\nreduces iron precipitation and adsorption to particulate surfaces, two mechanisms by which\n\niron is removed from seawater (Sunda, 2010). Lower pH levels will also increase Fe(II)\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nconcentration, due to its ability to form carbonate complexes to a larger degree than the other\n\nfree metals and by increasing rates of Fe(III) reduction to soluble Fe(II) (Millero, 2001,\n\nMillero et al., 2009).\n\nDespite the complexity of iron regulation in the ocean, the study by Shi et al. (2010)\n\nhighlights potentially harmful effects of iron bioavailability due to ocean acidification. Iron is\n\nalso an important factor in the detoxification of hydrocarbons, by influencing the activity of\n\nenzymes that catalyze the oxidative breakdown of PAH (Dinkla et al., 2001, Santos et al.,\n\n2008). Monoxygenase and dioxygenase enzymes, essential in most microbial PAH degradation\n\npathways, require a metal cofactor which is often iron (Bugg, 2003, Dinkla et al., 2003). The\n\nactivity of several key enzymes involved in the degradation of the aromatic hydrocarbon\n\ntoluene by Pseudomonas putida, including toluene monooxygenase, was found to be reduced\n\nunder iron limitation conditions (Dinkla et al., 2001). Furthermore, increasing iron availability\n\nstimulates PAH degradation by increasing the activities of the enzymes involved in the aerobic\n\ndegradation, and by increasing PAH bioavailability due to the stimulation of biosurfactant\n\nproduction (Santos et al., 2008).\n\nMicrocosm coupled with molecular biology techniques as a study tool\n\nIn order to obtain the information necessary to formulate predictive models of the\n\ncombined effects of ocean acidification and UVR on pollutant toxicity and degradation, it is\n\nessential to move forward from a phenomenological approach to a mechanistic view of the\n\neffects of climate change at several scales, ranging from communities to individual organisms\n\nat cellular, genetic and biochemical levels (Reid, 2011). However, anthropogenic\n\nenvironmental perturbations occur over a very wide range of spatial and temporal scales and\n\nthe characterization of cause-effect relationships is difficult to gauge, particularly when\n\nstudying additional levels of complexity such as synergistic effects with other stressors. Small\n\nscale models, such as micro- and mesocosms, can provide useful tools to obtain an integrated\n\nview of various phenomena. The distinction between microcosms and mesocosms systems is\n\nsomewhat arbitrary. Laboratory small size systems are often referred to as microcosm and\n\nlarger 'outdoor' systems are usually referred to as mesocosms.\n\nMicrocosms are simplified ecosystems, constructed to mimic natural ecosystems under\n\ncontrolled conditions (Roeselers et al., 2006). Their size, design and cost vary with the research\n\nproblem to be addressed. They can range from simple flasks and glass containers (Buckling et\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n18\n\nal., 2002) to more elaborate controlled environments, such as those developed by Mock and\n\ncolleagues to simulate the ice-water interface (Mock et al., 2003). The major advantage of these\n\nexperimental setups is that they enable a high degree of experimental control and replication\n\nthat are important to our understanding of ecological processes in microbial populations or\n\ncommunities. The level of experimental control provided by microcosms is virtually\n\nimpossible to obtain through field surveys or outdoor mesocosm experimentation (Benton et\n\nal., 2007, Jessup et al., 2004). In addition to this, microcosms permit experimental exposure to\n\ntoxic substances that would not be possible in a field setting.\n\nAn important, but valid, criticism is that these models are of limited relevance in\n\nunderstanding large-scale processes, as opposed to field studies (Carpenter et al., 1997). There\n\nis a concern that these models are too small in spatial and temporal scales to be useful.\n\nHowever, the goal of the microcosm is not to fully reproduce nature in a laboratory model\n\nsystem, but rather to simplify complex ecosystems (Jessup et al., 2004). Depending on the\n\nresearch question, laboratory models are not only a valid approach but they can isolate\n\nvariables and capture essential dynamics of ecological systems better than field studies\n\n(Cadotte et al., 2005). Although only presenting a limited representation of nature, microcosm\n\nexperiments allow the deconstruction of nature to explore hypotheses and test mechanisms\n\npresumed to be operating in field systems (Jessup et al., 2004, Cadotte et al., 2005, Benton et al.,\n\n2007).\n\nMicrobial microcosms are particularly interesting since they can overcome scale related\n\nmicrocosm limitations. The small sizes and short generation times of microorganisms allow\n\nmicrocosm experiments with a representative range of spatial and temporal scales (Jessup et\n\nal., 2004). Microbial microcosm systems have already allowed the study of ecological processes\n\nincluding the study of predator-prey coevolution (Jessup et al., 2004), ecosystem level-selection\n\n(Swenson et al., 2000), resource competition (Grover, 2000) and adaptive radiation (Rainey et\n\nal., 1998). Simple microcosms have also been used to study the effect of global change on\n\nmicrobial communities and simple culture bottles were already used to study the effects of\n\nenvironmental warming on eukaryotic microbial communities (Petchey et al., 1999).\n\nA major concern in microcosm experiments is whether the structural and functional\n\nproperties of the source ecosystem are well represented in the microcosm (Rainey et al., 1998).\n\nBefore extrapolating microcosm results to the source ecosystem, ecological parameters must\n\nbe compared to determine whether they are within certain limits (Pritchard et al., 1984, Leser,\n\n1994). It is important to underline that laboratory model-systems cannot be the sole focus of\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nthe research. Microcosm studies must be developed along with modeling and they can also be\n\nseen as an important complement to field studies in order to address specific hypotheses\n\n(Benton et al., 2007). Many field studies, for example, only provide correlative evidence of\n\ncertain phenomena. For example, the community structure of certain microbial communities\n\nmay be significantly related to variation in certain environmental variables (Cleary et al., 2012).\n\nMicrocosm experiments can help to elucidate whether there is an actual mechanistic effect of\n\none or more of these variables on community composition.\n\nAnother advantage of using less complex microbial models is that we now have the\n\ntools to characterize the composition and function of microbial communities with\n\nunprecedented resolution. The introduction of high-throughput \u201comics\u201d technologies in\n\nmicrobial ecology now allows us to study complex microbial communities at several levels of\n\nbiological organization without the need of prior cultivation. First restricted to genomes\n\n(metagenomics), it is now possible to detect RNA transcripts (metatranscriptomics), protein\n\nlevels (metaproteomics) and metabolites (metabolomics). We are, however, still far from being\n\nable to use this information to map every biochemical path and trophic interactions so as to\n\ndevelop descriptive and predictive models (Raes et al., 2008, Jansson et al., 2012). Nevertheless,\n\nthese technologies enable a thorough characterization of the structure; function and genetic\n\npotential of microbial communities and under controlled conditions can contribute to the\n\nassessment and monitoring of the effects of global climate changes on key biogeochemical\n\nand ecological processes.\n\nMicrocosm experiments paired with new \u201comics\u201d technologies can provide an\n\nexcellent framework to test anthropogenic pollutant toxicity under different climate change\n\nscenarios in marine environments. Such small-scale experiments help to unravel key structural\n\nand functional aspects of environmental microbiology, and may help to test hypotheses that\n\nwould be virtually impossible to test in nature. As mentioned previously, microcosms have\n\nalready made important contributions to our understanding of microbial ecology. However, in\n\norder to simulate global change scenarios such as those discussed above, with a high degree of\n\nexperimental control, more complex microcosm systems are required.\n\nAlthough there are some major technical challenges that still need to be met with\n\nrespect to data acquisition and integration, the ultimate goal must be the development of\n\nintegrated approaches that will enable us to test various climate change scenarios and to\n\nascertain what effect they will have on microbial composition, nutrient cycling and the toxicity\n\nof anthropogenic pollutants.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n20\n\nLiterature cited\n\nAllgaier M, Riebesell U, Vogt M, Thyrhaug R,\n\nGrossart H (2008) Coupling of heterotrophic\n\nbacteria to phytoplankton bloom development at\n\ndifferent pCO2 levels : a mesocosm study.\n\nBiogeosciences, 5, 1007-1022.\n\nAlonso-S\u00e1ez L, Gasol JM, Lefort T, Hofer J,\n\nSommaruga R (2006) Effect of natural sunlight on\n\nbacterial activity and differential sensitivity of\n\nnatural bacterioplankton groups in northwestern\n\nMediterranean coastal waters.

Screening for PAH dioxygenase\n\ngenes detected almost identical nahAc genes (encoding the alpha subunits of naphthalene dioxygenase) in 2\n\nphylogenetically distinct isolates: Pseudomonas sp. and an unknown species of the family Enterobacteriaceae; this\n\nsuggested that horizontal transfer of nah genes might be involved in PAH degradation in the SML. We also\n\ninvestigated the effect of PAH contamination on the spatial variability of the bacterioneuston along a gradient of\n\npollution in the estuarine system of the Ria de Aveiro. Culture-independent techniques - fluorescence in situ\n\nhybridization (FISH) and denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) - revealed a similar structure among\n\nthe bacterioneuston communities along the estuary. In contrast, we detected differences in the relative\n\nabundance and diversity of organisms of the Gammaproteobacteria, including those of the genus Pseudomonas (which\n\nbelongs to the Gammaproteobacteria). This is the first insight into the hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in\n\nthe SML of an estuarine area polluted with hydrocarbons. Our findings highlight the importance of SML-adapted\n\nhydrocarbonoclastic bacterioneuston as a potential source of new PAH-degrading bacteria (including new\n\npseudomonads) with potential use in the bioremediation of hydrocarbon-polluted ecosystems.\n\nKeywords: Sea surface microlayer, Bacterioneuston, Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAH\ndegradation\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe surface microlayer (SML) is the interface between the atmosphere and the\n\nhydrosphere. This layer is roughly defined as the uppermost millimeter of the water column,\n\nand is characterized as a unique environment with distinct chemical and physical processes\n\nwhen compared with the underlying water (UW) (Liss et al., 1997, Cunliffe et al., 2009b,\n\nCunliffe et al., 2011).\n\n\n\nExploring hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in the estuarine surface microlayer\n\n30\n\nThe formation of the SML results from the\n\naccumulation of particles at the air\u2013water interface,\n\nestablishing a film that extends into the UW\n\n(Cunliffe et al., 2011). Recently, the classical model\n\nof the SML as a stratified structure with an upper\n\nlipid and a lower protein\u2013polysaccharide layer\n\n(Hardy, 1982) has been reviewed. Wurl &amp; Holmes\n\n(2008) reported that the enrichment of transparent\n\nexopolymer particles (TEPs) in the SML at several\n\nlocations around Singapore appears to support the\n\nmodel of the SML first advanced by Sieburth\n\n(1983), i.e. a hydrated gelatinous film (Sieburth,\n\n1983, Wurl et al., 2008, Cunliffe et al., 2009a,\n\nCunliffe et al., 2011). The organisms within the SML\n\nare known collectively as neuston; the bacterial\n\nfraction of the neuston is the bacterioneuston\n\n(Franklin et al., 2005). The importance of the SML\n\nin the control of environmental processes, and in\n\nthe exchange of chemicals between the water and\n\nthe atmosphere (Wurl et al., 2004, Obernosterer et\n\nal., 2010, Cunliffe et al., 2009b), has raised interest in\n\nthe effects of the activities of the bacterioneuston in\n\nthis ecosystem. Cunliffe et al. (2008) found evidence\n\nthat the diversity of functional genes encoding\n\nsubunits of methane monoxygenase (mmox) and\n\ncarbon monoxide dehydrogenase (coxL) is different\n\nin the SML when compared with the UW (Cunliffe\n\net al., 2008). There is an emerging consensus that\n\nthe SML harbors microbial communities distinct\n\nfrom those in the UW (for a full review see Cunliffe\n\net al. 2011); however, there is still a lack of\n\nknowledge on both the structure and function of\n\nthe SML community. For example, due to the\n\nFigure II-1: Ria de Aveiro (Portugal). Sampling\nsites are indicated with arrows: Stn S1 in the\n\nCanal de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o, Stns S2 and S3 near the\n\nharbour facilities, and Stns S4 and S5 in the\n\nCanal de \u00cdlhavo.\n\n\n\nExploring hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in the estuarine surface microlayer\n\n31\n\nchemical nature of the SML, natural and anthropogenic aromatic compounds - e.g. polycyclic\n\naromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) - can be concentrated up to ~500\u00c5 in this layer in relation to\n\nthe rest of the water column (Wurl et al., 2004). High concentrations of PAHs have been\n\nfound in the SML at locations chronically polluted with oil hydrocarbons (OH), such as\n\nshipping harbours (Cincinelli et al., 2001, Wurl et al., 2004). However, so far, no studies have\n\nexploited the potential of microorganisms in the SML to degrade PAHs, or have investigated\n\nthe effect of PAHs on the bacterioneuston. It is reasonable to hypothesize that the increased\n\nlevels of PAHs in the SML may stimulate the development of hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial\n\npopulations in this layer. However, studies on the effects of PAH pollution on\n\nbacterioneuston are scarce, and none has specifically addressed the hydrocarbonoclastic\n\nbacterial populations of the SML. In order to obtain more information about the\n\nbacterioneuston, and the potential of these organisms to degrade PAHs, we: (1) isolated and\n\nidentified representatives of the hydrocarbonoclastic population in the SML, and (2) screened\n\nthe isolates for genes encoding enzymes involved in the degradation of PAHs. We also\n\nevaluated the effect of OH pollution on the spatial variability of the bacterioneuston in a\n\ngradient of contamination in the estuarine system of the Ria de Aveiro in Portugal.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nStudy site and sampling\n\nRia de Aveiro is a branched estuarine ecosystem, also described as a coastal lagoon,\n\nlocated in the northwest coast of Portugal. Samples for the selective isolation of\n\nhydrocarbonoclastic bacterioneuston were obtained from the SML in the middle section of\n\nthe estuary, near a shipping harbour. In order to characterize the spatial variation of the\n\nbacterioneuston, 5 collecting points were chosen for sampling. Extending from the outer\n\nsegment of the lagoon to the inner section of Canal de \u00cdlhavo, the sites were designated: S1\n\n(40\u00b0 40\u2019 01\u201d N, 08\u00b0 49\u2019 24\u201d W) in the outer section, S2 (40\u00b039 29 N, 08\u00b042 12 W) and S3 (40\u00b0\n\n38\u2019 20\u201d N, 08\u00b0 41\u2019 32\u201d W) in the middle section (near the shipping harbour), and S4 (40\u00b0 37\u2019\n\n21\u201d N, 08\u00b0 41\u2019 01\u201d W) and S5 (40\u00b0 35\u2019 41\u201d N, 08\u00b0 41\u2019 21\u201d W) in the inner section of the Canal\n\nde \u00cdlhavo (Figure II-1). Samples were collected from the SML with plexiglass and glass plates.\n\nBoth plates were 0.25 m wide, 0.35 m long, and 4 mm thick. Prior to sample collection, the\n\nplates were rinsed with ethanol and sterile distilled water. The plates were introduced vertically\n\n\n\nExploring hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in the estuarine surface microlayer\n\n32\n\nthrough the SML and withdrawn in the same position. Excess water was allowed to drain for\n\nabout 5 s. Approximately 5 ml of water were collected each time the plates were introduced\n\ninto the SML. The water adhering to the plate was subsequently removed from both sides of\n\nthe plate with a wiper blade system (Harvey et al., 1972). The estimated thickness of the\n\ncollected SML, determined from the volume of collected sample and the area of both sides of\n\nthe plate, was approximately 60 ?m, which is in the range reported by Harvey &amp; Burzell\n\n(1972) for SML glass plate samplers. Salinity was determined immediately after the sampling\n\nwith a WTW (Wissenschaftlich Technische Werkst\u00e4tten) Cond330i/SET. Quantification of\n\nPAHs was performed by gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (gas chromatograph Varian\n\nCP-3800 with split/splitless injection and mass spectrometry detector\u2014Ion Trap Saturn 2200)\n\nwith detection limits between 20 and 40 ng l-1. The result was calculated as the average of 2\n\nsub-samples and expressed in ng l-1.\n\nEnrichment and isolation of PAH-degrading bacteria\n\nA PAH, 2-methylnaphthalene, was used as the sole source of carbon and energy for\n\nthe enrichment and isolation of PAH-degrading bacteria in a liquid mineral medium (MM).\n\nSelective plates were prepared by adding 2% (wt/vol) agarose to MM. The 2-\n\nmethylnaphthalene (Fluka) was added by spreading ethanol solutions (50 mg ml-1) onto the\n\nsurface of the solid medium. Inoculation was carried out only when the solvent had fully\n\nevaporated, producing a film of PAH on the surface of the medium (Ma et al., 2006).\n\nBacterioneuston samples for enrichment cultures were collected near the shipping harbour. A\n\nvolume of 200 ml of SML sample was added to 800 ml of sterile MM with 200 mg of 2-\n\nmethylnaphthalene (Fluka) in a 1 l sterilized Erlenmeyer flask. The liquid cultures were\n\nincubated at room temperature for 2 weeks, in the absence of light, on a rotary shaker (90\n\nrpm). After the enrichment, 20 ml of culture were transferred to fresh medium and incubated\n\nfor the same period of time. After 2 similar subcultures, a serial dilution of the culture was\n\nspread onto the MM selective plates. These cultures were incubated at 25\u00b0C for up to 14 d,\n\nprotected from light. Individual isolated colonies were further purified by re-streaking onto\n\nnew MM selective plates. Control plates without 2-methylnaphthalene were also incubated.\n\nExtraction of DNA\n\n\n\nExploring hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in the estuarine surface microlayer\n\n33\n\nGenomic DNA was extracted from all the strains recovered from the isolation\n\nprocedure, as previously described by Henriques et al. (2004). Environmental samples were\n\nfiltered (pore size: 0.2 ?m; Poretics Products). Total DNA was extracted in 3 replicates and\n\npurified using the Genomic DNA Purification Kit (MBI Fermentas) (Henriques et al., 2004).\n\nMolecular characterization and identification of the PAH-degrading bacterial isolates\n\nFor molecular typing of the isolates, a repetitive-sequence PCR using a BOX A1R\n\nprimer (BOX-PCR fingerprinting) was followed (Rademaker et al., 1998). BOX-PCR profiles\n\nwere visualized after separation of PCR amplicons by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel using\n\n1\u00d7TAE (Trisacetate-EDTA) at 100 V for 3 h. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide\n\nand digitalized in a Molecular Imager FXTM system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The band\n\npositions were normalized with the GeneRuler\u21221 kb Plus DNA ladder (75\u201320 000 bp) and\n\nanalysed with GelCompar I software (Applied Maths) using the pairwise Pearson\u2019s product\u2013\n\nmoment correlation coefficient (r-value). Cluster analysis of the similarity matrices was\n\nperformed by the unweighted pair-group method (UPGMA) using arithmetic averages. For\n\nisolates displaying distinct BOX-PCR profiles, the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR\n\nusing the universal bacterial primers U27 and 1492R (Weisburg et al., 1991). PCR products\n\nfrom the amplified 16S rRNA were used as templates in the sequencing reactions - which\n\nwere carried out using an ABI PRISM_BigDye_Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction\n\nKit (PE Applied Biosystems). Sequences were subjected to BLAST (Basic Local Alignment\n\nSearch Tool) analysis. These isolates were also screened for the Pseudomonas-specific gacA\n\ngene using primers GACA-1F and GACA-2 (De Souza et al., 2003). All PCR reagents were\n\npurchased from MBI Fermentas unless otherwise indicated.\n\nDetection of the dioxygenase gene\n\nPCR was used for detecting genes that encode enzymes involved in the aerobic\n\ndegradation of PAHs in the isolated strains. Primers specific for the alpha subunit of the\n\nPAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenases, common to Gram-negative PAH degraders (PAH-\n\nRHD?GNF and PAH-RHD?GNR primers), were used to obtain amplicons of ca. 306 bp\n\n(C\u00e9bron et al., 2008). The PCR products were used as templates in the sequencing reactions.\n\nSequencing was carried out as described in the previous section, and a comparison was made\n\n\n\nExploring hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in the estuarine surface microlayer\n\n34\n\nwith sequences available in the GenBank database by using the BLAST service to determine\n\ntheir closest relative. All PCR reagents were purchased from MBI Fermentas unless otherwise\n\nindicated.\n\nMicrobial community structure\n\nDenaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE): DGGE was performed on the\n\nPseudomonas-specific gacA gene sequence amplified from bacterial isolates and from\n\nenvironmental samples. This technique was also applied to the 16S rRNA gene sequence\n\namplified from environmental samples. A nested PCR approach was used to amplify the 16S\n\nrRNA gene fragments for DGGE analyses. For the first PCR, the universal bacterial primers\n\nU27 and 1492R were used to amplify ca. 1450 bp of the 16S rRNA gene (Weisburg et al.,\n\n1991). The amount of template DNA used per reaction was ca. 10 ng. For the second PCR, 1\n\n?l of the product of the first PCR was used as template with bacterial DGGE primers 968F-\n\nGC and 1401R (ca. 433 bp) (N\u00fcbel et al., 1996). A nested-PCR approach was also applied to\n\nthe amplification of Pseudomonas-specific gacA gene fragments for DGGE analysis (Costa et al.,\n\n2007). For the first PCR, primers GACA-1F and GACA-2 were used to amplify ca. 425 bp of\n\nthe gacA gene (De Souza et al., 2003). The amount of template DNA used per reaction was ca.\n\n10 ng. An aliquot of 1 ?l of the product of the first PCR was used as the template for a\n\nsecond PCR with primers gacA1F-GC and gacA2R (Costa et al., 2007). All PCR reagents were\n\npurchased from MBI Fermentas unless otherwise indicated. DGGE analysis was performed\n\nwith a CBS-DGGE 2401 system (CBS Scientific). The GC-clamped amplicons were applied to\n\na double-gradient polyacryl-amide gel containing 6 to 9% acrylamide (Rotiphorese) with a\n\ngradient of 30 to 58% of denaturant. The run was performed in Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer\n\n(0.5 M Tris-Base, Sigma, 0.05 M EDTA, Sigma; 0.1 M CH3CO2Na, Sigma, pH 8.0) at 60\u00b0C at\n\na constant voltage of 220 V for 16 h. The DGGE gels were silver stained (Heuer et al., 2001).\n\nThe Shannon index of diversity (H) was used to compare the complexity of the DGGE\n\nprofiles. The band position and relative intensity (abundance) of each lane (community) were\n\nused as parameters to indicate categories (Costa et al., 2006). Parametric analysis of variance\n\n(Anova) was applied to assess significant differences between samples, provided that data\n\nwere normally distributed. The relative abundance of members of the domain Bacteria and the\n\nGammaproteobacteria in the SML was assessed by Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)\n\n(Pernthaler et al., 2001) using Cy3-labeled oligonucleotide probes (MWG Biotech). Triplicate\n\n\n\nExploring hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in the estuarine surface microlayer\n\n35\n\nsamples (1 ml) were filtered through polycarbonate filters (pore size: 0.2 ?m; GE Osmonics),\n\nfixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and rinsed with 1\u00d7PBS and MilliQ water. The\n\nfilters were stored at room temperature until hybridization. The probes used in this study were\n\nEUB338 for the domain Bacteria (Amann et al., 1990) and EUB338-II and EUB338-III to\n\ncover the phyla Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia (Daims et al., 1999). For the\n\nGammaproteobacteria we used the probes GAM42a (Manz et al., 1992) and an unlabeled\n\ncompetitor probe specific for the Betaproteobacteria. A non-binding probe was also used as a\n\ncontrol for nonspecific binding (Karner et al., 1997). Samples were examined with a Leitz\n\nLaborlux K microscope equipped with the appropriate filter sets for fluorescence from 4,6-\n\ndiamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and CY3. At least 10 fields were counted per replicate of\n\nsample. In addition to the relative abundance of organisms of the domain Bacteria and of the\n\nGammaproteobacteria, it was also possible to obtain a measure of total microorganisms with the\n\nDAPI counts. All reagents were purchased from Fluka, except when otherwise indicated.\n\nTotal microorganisms (DAPI counts) were tested for normality (Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test)\n\nbefore the comparison of means. Parametric Anova was performed, provided that data were\n\nnormally distributed.\n\nResults and discussion\n\nPhysical and chemical parameters\n\nSalinity in the analyzed SML samples ranged between 31.4% (Stn S5) and 36.0% (Stn\n\nS1). Salinity is an important factor that influences the structure and composition of\n\nprokaryotic assemblages in estuarine environments (Bouvier et al., 2002, Henriques et al.,\n\n2004). However, in this study, the variation of salinity along the estuarine profile was very\n\nsmall, and did not seem to influence the distribution of bacterial communities. The PAH\n\nanalyses revealed that the composition and concentration of PAHs varied along the estuary\n\n(Table II-1). Concentrations ranged from below the limit of detection of the method to 14 \u00b1\n\n5 ng l-1 of naphthalene. Stn S1 showed the lowest concentration of PAH (anthracene: 7.3 \u00b1\n\n0.2 ng l-1). In Stns S2 and S3, located near the shipping harbour, naphthalene reached the\n\nhighest concentrations (S2: 14 \u00b1 5 ng l-1; S3: 9.4 \u00b1 1.5 ng l-1). Naphthalene is the simplest of\n\nthe oil PAH compounds; it is the most easily degradable and is highly volatile (Sporstol et al.\n\n1983). The 3-ring PAH compounds anthracene (6.9 \u00b1 0.2 ng l-1) and phenanthrene (8.1 \u00b1 1.7\n\n\n\nExploring hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in the estuarine surface microlayer\n\n36\n\nng l-1) were detected at the Stns S2 and S3, respectively. At Stn S4, fluorene (9.4 \u00b1 1.5 ng l -1)\n\nwas the only PAH detected. Stn S5 showed the largest spectrum of PAH compounds\n\n(phenanthrene 5.2 \u00b1 0.1 ng l-1, fluoranthrene 8.5 \u00b1 1.1 ng l-1, benzo[a]anthracene 5.1 \u00b1 0.8 ng\n\nl-1 and benzo[k]fluoranthene 8.1 \u00b1 0.6 ng l-1).\n\nTable II-1: Concentrations of individual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the sea surface microlayer\n(SML) at Stns S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5.

This area showed the\n\nhighest levels of contamination by low-molecular-weight PAHs. These PAHs constitute a\n\nsignificant fraction of crude oil and petroleum products and are often used as indicators of\n\nrecent or chronic contamination with petroleum hydrocarbons (Sporstol et al., 1983). The\n\nPAH 2-methylnaphthalene, a common constituent of crude oil and fossil fuels, was used in\n\nthis study as the sole source of carbon and energy for the enrichment and isolation of strains\n\n\n\nExploring hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in the estuarine surface microlayer\n\n37\n\nof the hydrocarbonoclastic bacterioneuston (Kasai et al., 2002). The isolation procedure\n\nrecovered 42 bacterial isolates that were able to use 2-methylnaphthalene as the sole source of\n\ncarbon. Genotypic diversity of the isolates, assessed by the whole-genome BOX-PCR\n\nfingerprint method (Rademaker et al., 1998), assigned the isolates to 29 different genotypes.\n\nThe 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that all hydrocarbonoclastic isolates were\n\nGram-negative and had high homology with 6 different taxa: Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Serratia,\n\nAcinetobacter, Rhizobium and Vibrio (Table II-2).\n\nPseudomonas and Klebsiella were preponderant, accounting to 34.5 and 31.0%,\n\nrespectively, of the total representative isolates (10 isolates were assigned to the genus\n\nPseudomonas and 9 to Klebsiella). These results point to a high genotypic diversity in the\n\npopulations of hydrocarbonoclastic Pseudomonas in the SML (Table II-2). Members of this\n\ngenus have a remarkable ability to degrade a wide range of organic pollutants, including PAHs,\n\nhalogenated derivates and recalcitrant organic residues (Johnsen et al., 1996, Bhattacharya et al.,\n\n2003). Besides their capacity to degrade toxic compounds, species such as P. putida can\n\nefficiently produce a range of valuable compounds with industrial uses (Wackett, 2003). These\n\nabilities, together with enhanced stress resistance, amenability to genetic manipulation and\n\nsuitability as a host for heterologous expression, makes strains of Pseudomonas particularly\n\nuseful for biotechnological applications (Pucha?ka et al., 2008). As well as contamination with\n\nPAHs, the estuarine system of the Ria de Aveiro is also subject to chronic contamination with\n\ndomestic sewage (Cunha et al., 2000). This might explain the large number of isolates related\n\nto the family Enterobacteriaceae, such as Klebsiella and Serratia. Nonetheless, the catabolic capacity\n\nof Klebsiella strains to degrade hydrocarbons, including PAHs, has been previously described.\n\nA recent study suggested that Klebsiella can be an important part of the OH-degrading bacterial\n\ngroups in estuarine areas exposed to sewage contamination (Rodrigues et al., 2009).\n\nAcinetobacter and Rhizobium were also part of the culturable fraction of PAH degraders in the\n\nSML. Many environmental strains of Acinetobacter with hydrocarbon-degrading capacities have\n\nbeen isolated in terrestrial and marine environments (Vanbroekhoven et al., 2004, Rodrigues et\n\nal., 2009). Reports of the presence of Rhizobium in PAH-contaminated soils, and its\n\nhydrocarbon-degrading metabolism, are also available (Poonthrigpun et al., 2006). One of the\n\nisolates was identified as Vibrio, which has also been reported as a PAH degrader in marine\n\nenvironments (Hedlund et al., 2001).\n\nPAH-degrading isolates: detection of dioxygenase genes\n\n\n\nExploring hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in the estuarine surface microlayer\n\n38\n\nIn the present study, an attempt was made to detect genes encoding the enzyme\n\nsystem PAH-RHD? (involved in the initial step in bacterial metabolism of PAH) in the\n\nbacterioneuston isolates. All isolates, including those having similar BOX-PCR profiles, were\n\nscreened. Although the isolates were cultivated with 2-methylnaphthalene as the sole source of\n\ncarbon, and reference to the PAH-degrading capacity was obtained from the literature for all\n\nthe identified genera (Hedlund et al., 2001, Vanbroekhoven et al., 2004, Ma et al., 2006,\n\nPoonthrigpun et al., 2006, Rodrigues et al., 2009), PAH-RHD? gene sequences were detected\n\nin only 2 of the isolates.\n\nIsolate\ncode\n\nSequence\naccession\n\nno.a\nBOX\n\ngroupb\nClosest phylogenetic relative\n\nBLAST-N identityc % Accession no.d\n\n1 GU935753 1 Serratia sp. 99 EF111121.1\n2 GU935754 4 Uncultured Klebsiella sp. 95 EU344923.1\n5 GU935755 2 Acinetobacter johnsonii 98 FJ263917.1\n6 GU935756 1 Serratia sp. 97 EU109729.1\n7 GU935757 1 Klebsiella sp. 93 DQ923489.1\n10 GU935758 1 Pseudomonas sp. 96 FJ424813.1\n\n12 GU935759 1\nUncultured\nPseudomonas sp. 96 EU705005.1\n\n13 GU935760 1 Pseudomonas sp. 98 FN429930.1\n14 GU935761 1 Pseudomonas sp. 97 AB088548.1\n15 GU935762 1 Pseudomonas sp. 94 DQ839561.1\n16 GU935763 2 Klebsiella terrigena 95 AF129442.1\n19 GU935764 1 Serratia proteamaculans 97 AY559499.1\n20 GU935765 1 Klebsiella sp. 97 EU545402.1\n21 GU935766 1 Acinetobacter johnsonii 98 AM184278.1\n22 GU935767 1 Rhizobium sp. 99 EF599760.1\n23 GU935768 1 Uncultured Klebsiella sp. 97 EU344923.1\n24 GU935769 1 Pseudomonas sp. 97 FJ789687.1\n25 GU935770 1 Uncultured bacterium 99 GQ069755.1\n26 GU935771 1 Serratia sp. 96 EF111121.1\n\n27 GU935772 1 UnculturedPseudomonas sp. 98 DQ295987.1\n\n28 GU935773 3 Klebsiella sp. 95 DQ229100.1\n31 GU935774 2 Uncultured Klebsiella sp. 97 EF679185.1\n32 GU935775 1 Uncultured\n\nPseudomonas sp.\n95 DQ295987.1\n\n36 GU935776 4\nKlebsiella\nornithinolytica 100 AF129441.1\n\n37 GU935777 2 Pseudomonas sp. 97 FN429930.1\n40 GU935778 1 Pseudomonas sp. 99 AB506040.1\n41 GU935779 1 Rhizobium sp. 98 EU741078.1\n42 GU935780 2 Klebsiella sp. 97 EU888474.1\n44 GU935781 1 Vibrio proteolyticus 93 DQ995521.1\n\na GenBank sequence accession numbers of the respective isolate\nb Number of genotypes clustered in the same BOX group\nc Blast-N max identity classification\nd GenBank sequence accession number of most closely related bacterial sequence(s)\n\nTable II-2: Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences from the isolated strains, and their\ntentative assignment to different taxonomic categories\n\n\n\nExploring hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in the estuarine surface microlayer\n\n39\n\nA positive PCR amplification product was obtained only for isolates #10 (Pseudomonas sp.) and\n\n#25, an unknown member of the family Enterobacteriaceae. However, the lack of amplification\n\ndoes not exclude the presence of dioxygenases in the other isolates; instead, this result may\n\nindicate the presence of novel genes encoding PAH-degrading enzymes in these\n\nhydrocarbonoclastic organisms. Moreover, because we did not monitor the complete cleavage\n\nof the benzene rings in this study, it cannot be excluded that the isolated strains oxidize only\n\nthe methyl group of 2-methylnaphtalene. It is possible that the ndo-negative isolates use the\n\nmethyl group as a source of carbon and energy without cleaving the benzene ring.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis, by BLAST, of our PAH-RHD? gene sequences and their closest\n\nrelatives showed that both PAH-RHD? genes clustered together with the archetypal nahAc\n\ngene carried by the plasmid pNAH20 (Yen et al., 1982, Eeva et al., 2000, Sota et al., 2006)\n\n(Figure II-2). As identical PAH-RHD? genes with high homology to those in naphthalene-\n\ndegrading plasmids occur in different bacterial families, it is reasonable to speculate that\n\nhorizontal gene transfer may also play a role in the occurrence and spreading of\n\nhydrocarbonoclastic capacity in the SML. Horizontal exchange of genes encoding the\n\ndegradation of xenobiotic compounds is a common phenomenon in biofilms (Singh et al.,\n\n2006). A preponderance of biofilm growing cells in the SML could favor ecological processes\n\nthat occur in communities with cells in close proximity, such as gene transfer and quorum\n\nsensing (Cunliffe et al., 2009b).\n\nFigure II-2: Phylogenetic relationships between dioxygenase-encoding genes amplified from the isolated strains\n(E08 was obtained from clone 25, F08 from clone 10). The tree was constructed by using the neighbor-joining\n\nmethod and bootstrapping analysis (1000 repetitions). The numbers on the branches indicate percentages of\n\nbootstrap values. The scale bar represents the percentage of amino acid divergence.\n\n\n\nExploring hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in the estuarine surface microlayer\n\n40\n\nThe effect of sampling site on the community structure of the bacterioneuston\n\nWhole-community and Pseudomonas structural diversity\n\nBecause most microorganisms are refractory to cultivation, culture-independent\n\nmethods are fundamental in the characterization of the structure of microbial communities in\n\nthe environment (Amann et al., 1995). DGGE was used to assess the structural diversity of the\n\noverall bacterial community. The banding pattern analysis of the PCR-amplified 16S rRNA\n\ngene showed a large number of equally abundant bands in bacterioneuston communities from\n\nall the sampling sites (Figure II-3). The Shannon diversity index revealed no significant\n\ndifferences between sites (Table II-3). This analysis suggests that the dominant bacterial\n\ncommunities are very similar in the SML of different sampling sites. Earlier studies, using\n\nDGGE, found that the dominant bacterioneuston communities were similar in 2 different\n\nareas of the Blyth estuary (Cunliffe et al., 2008). Recently, this author also reported that\n\nbacterioneuston communities from 2 different areas, close to the Hawaiian Island of Oahu,\n\nwere more similar to each other than to their subjacent bacterioplankton communities\n\n(Cunliffe et al., 2009a).\n\nDue to the preponderance of Pseudomonas among the bacteria isolated from the PAH-\n\nenrichment culture, and because of the recognized ability of the organisms of this genus to\n\ndegrade PAHs, we paid particular attention to the diversity of a Pseudomonas genetic marker in\n\nthe SML at all sites. The Pseudomonas-specific gacA gene was used as a genetic marker for this\n\ngenus. This gene influences the production of several secondary metabolites in Pseudomonas\n\nspp., and it can be used as a complementary genetic marker for detecting bacteria of this genus\n\nin environmental samples (De Souza et al., 2003).\n\nInterestingly, contrary to what was observed for the bacterial fingerprints, analysis of\n\nthe Pseudomonas community showed a significant (Anova, P&lt;0.05) increase in diversity (Table\n\nII-3) from the outer (Stn S1) to the middle (Stn S3) and inner (Stn S5) sections of the estuary,\n\nfollowing the concentrations of PAH and organic matter. This pattern may explain the high\n\nabundance of Pseudomonas strains recovered from the SML-PAH enrichments obtained in the\n\narea with higher levels of lighter (low-molecular-weight) PAHs. As previously mentioned,\n\nmembers of this genus are known for their ability to metabolize light PAH compounds and\n\nother monoaromatic hydrocarbons. The gacA DGGE pattern of the isolated strains, and the\n\ngacA profile of whole bacterioneuston, showed a common band with the mobility exhibited by\n\n\n\nExploring hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in the estuarine surface microlayer\n\n41\n\nisolate #27 (Figure II-4). This band is present in the bacterioneuston from Stns S1, S2 and S3,\n\nbut is absent in samples from Stns S4 and S5, at the inner section of the estuary. Interestingly,\n\nisolate #27 showed a high homology with an uncultured Pseudomonas which has been linked to\n\nthe transformation of organic compounds in coastal seawater (Xiaozhen et al., 2007). These\n\nresults suggest that the distribution of Pseudomonas populations may also be related to the\n\nquality and composition of lipophilic organic compounds in the SML.\n\nFigure II-3: Denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprints of 16S rRNA gene fragments amplified from\nbacterioneuston obtained from the surface microlayer at Stns S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5.\n\n\n\nExploring hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in the estuarine surface microlayer\n\n42\n\nTable II-3: Mean and standard deviation of the Shannon diversity indices calculated from denaturing-gradient\ngel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles of bacterial 16S rRNA and the Pseudomonas-specific gacA gene in\n\nbacterioneuston from the surface microlayer (SML) at Stns S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5\n\nDGGE profile\nShannon diversity indices at site\n\nS1 S2 S3 S4 S5\n\nPseudomonas-specificgacA 0.9\u00b10.2 1.3\u00b10.5 2.0\u00b10.2 2.0\u00b10.2 2.2\u00b10.2\n\nBacterial 16S rRNA 2.36\u00b10.29 2.24\u00b10.24 2.44\u00b10.29 2.22\u00b10.37 2.58\n\n*It was only possible to obtain one replicate of Bacterial 16S rRNA in site S5.\n\nFigure II-4: Denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprints of Pseudomonas-specific gacA gene\nfragments amplified from bacterioneuston in the surface microlayer collected at Stns S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5.\n\nThe position of the arrow corresponds to the melting behaviour of fragments corresponding to isolate\n\n#27, classified as an uncultured Pseudomonas sp.\n\n\n\nExploring hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in the estuarine surface microlayer\n\n43\n\nMicrobial abundance overall and in the Gammaproteobacteria\n\nFISH was applied in this study to assess the spatial variability in the total abundance of\n\nmicroorganisms and also for quantifying members of the domain Bacteria and the\n\nGammaproteobacteria in the SML (Amann et al., 1990, Manz et al., 1992, Karner et al., 1997,\n\nDaims et al., 1999, Pernthaler et al., 2001). The overall abundance of microorganisms estimated\n\nfrom DAPI counts ranged from 2.3 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 106cells ml-1 at Stn S1, to 5.0 \u00b1 0.9 \u00d7 106 cells ml-1\n\nat Stn S5, defining a significant (Anova, P &lt;0.05) gradient of enrichment from the outer to\n\nthe inner sections of the estuary (Figure II-5). The total cell number is within the range\n\n(4.9\u00d7105 cells ml-1 to 6.2 \u00d7 106 cells ml-1) observed in the Ria de Vigo, Spain, estuary\n\n(Zdanowski et al., 1997). The pattern of variation that we detected corresponds, in general, to\n\nthe structure of an estuary in which bacterial abundance and phytoplankton biomass are\n\nmaximal at the intermediate sections (Wright et al., 1983, Fuks et al., 1991, Cunha et al., 2003).\n\nThis distribution is probably related to the quality (lability) of the available organic matter\n\nalong the estuary. The relative abundance of organisms of the domain Bacteria varied between\n\n50.4 \u00b1 3.6% at Stn S2 and 66.7 \u00b1 9.2% at Stn S4 (Figure II-5).\n\nFigure II-5: Variations in total prokaryote abundance (as counted by 4 ,6-\ndiamidino-2-phenylindole [DAPI] staining) and relative abundance of Bacteria\n\nand Gammproteobacteria (% of DAPI counts) determined by fluorescence in situ\n\nhybridization in bacterioneuston in the surface microlayer collected at Stns S1,\n\nS2, S3, S4 and S5.

The missing percentage could be\n\nrelated to other groups not covered by this study. Results of a CARD-FISH analysis, revealed\n\nthat up to 37% of the total cell numbers recovered from the SML in high mountain lakes\n\nhybridized with Archaea-specific probes (Auguet et al., 2008). The relative abundance of\n\norganisms of the domain Bacteria did not show a defined trend of spatial variation along the\n\nestuary. On the contrary, the highest value for the relative abundance of organisms of the\n\nGammaproteobacteria (19.7 \u00b1 1.0%) was found in the SML at Stn S3 (Figure II-5), where\n\nnaphthalene and phenantrene were detected. Gammaproteobacteria were selected as a target for\n\nFISH analysis because this group includes many of the PAH-degrading genera, such as\n\nAlcanivorax, Cycloclasticus, Pseudomonas, Oleiphilus, Oleispira and Thalassolituus (Watanabe, 2001,\n\nHead et al., 2006). Although the abundance and distribution of microorganisms in marine and\n\nestuarine waters is influenced by complex biotic and abiotic interactions (Shiah et al., 1995),\n\nthe high concentration of low-molecular-weight PAHs, generally easily degraded (Yamada et\n\nal., 2003), at sampling Stn S3 can be related to the high relative abundance of\n\nGammaproteobacteria at this site. Exposure to hydrocarbons has been shown to decrease\n\nbacterial diversity, as a result of selection in favor of PAH-degrading bacteria (Roling et al.,\n\n2002, Castle et al., 2006). Nonetheless, other sources of organic carbon might also have\n\ninfluenced the distribution of this group. The preference of Gammaproteobacteria for high\n\nconcentrations of nutrients has been previously reported, and peaks of abundance appeared to\n\nbe related to particular point sources of nutrients (Bouvier et al., 2002, Henriques et al., 2004).\n\nConclusions\n\nTo our knowledge, we are the first to have isolated and characterized\n\nhydrocarbonoclastic strains of bacterioneuston from estuarine SML exposed to chronic OH\n\ncontamination; the most dominant isolates belonged to the genus Pseudomonas (members of\n\nthe Gammaproteobacteria). The SML is the first marine habitat to be in contact with hydrophobic\n\nOH pollutants after an oil spill accident. The possibility of using hydrocarbonoclastic\n\nbacterioneuston isolates in a bioremediation strategy for the rapid degradation of oil slicks\n\nshould be examined in future studies. The SML has the potential to be a natural \u2018seed bank\u2019\n\nthat can be useful for isolating and \u2018domesticating\u2019 novel bacteria for PAH degradation. The\n\nability of the hydrocarbonoclastic bacterioneuston to withstand and degrade toxic\n\n\n\nExploring hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in the estuarine surface microlayer\n\n45\n\ncompounds, together with its capacity to survive in this environment, make the isolates\n\nrecovered in this study interesting candidates for future research on in situ SML\n\nbioremediation.\n\nThe cultivation-independent analyses (FISH counts and Pseudomonas-DGGE) agreed\n\nwith the isolation results. These findings indicate that the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria\n\nand the diversity of Pseudomonas in the bacterioneuston have undergone significant changes in\n\nareas contaminated with elevated levels of OH in the Ria de Aveiro. However, the ecological\n\nrole of the bacterioneuston in the degradation of hydrophobic OH pollutants is still unclear.\n\nFuture work should focus on more in-depth functional analyses of genes whose\n\nexpression/repression are most likely related to SML contamination by OH compounds.\n\nAcknowledgements The authors thank the 2 anonymous reviewers for their constructive and critical\ncomments that considerably improved the earlier versions of the manuscript.

Cleary and Newton C.M. Gomes\n\nGlobal Change Biology (2013)\n\nAbstract: An experimental life support system (ELSS) was constructed to study the interactive effects of\nmultiple stressors on coastal and estuarine benthic communities, specifically perturbations driven by global\n\nclimate change and anthropogenic environmental contamination. The ELSS enables the control of salinity, pH,\n\ntemperature, ultraviolet radiation (UVR), tidal rhythms and exposure to selected contaminants. Unlike most\n\nmicrocosms previously described, the ELSS enables true independent replication (including randomisation). In\n\naddition to this, it can be assembled using commercially available materials and equipment, thereby facilitating\n\nthe replication of identical experimental setups in different geographical locations. The present study aimed the\n\nvalidation of the reproducibility and environmental quality of the system by comparing chemical and biological\n\nparameters recorded in our ELSS with those prevalent in the natural environment. Water, sediment microbial\n\ncommunity and ragworm (the polychaete Hediste diversicolor) samples were obtained from four microcosms after\n\n57 days of operation. In general, average concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients (NO3-; NH4+ and PO4 3-\n\n) in the water-column of the ELSS experimental control units were within the range of concentrations recorded\n\nin the natural environment. While some shifts in bacterial community composition were observed between in situ\n\nand ELSS sediment samples, the relative abundance of most metabolically active bacterial taxa appeared to be\n\nstable. In addition, ELSS operation did not significantly affect survival, oxidative stress and neurological\n\nbiomarkers of the model organism H. diversicolor. The validation data indicates that this system can be used to\n\nassess independent or interactive effects of climate change and environmental contamination on benthic\n\ncommunities. Researchers will be able to simulate the effects of these stressors on processes driven by microbial\n\ncommunities, sediment and seawater chemistry and to evaluate potential consequences to sediment toxicity using\n\nmodel organisms such as Hediste diversicolor.\n\nKeywords: microcosm, microbial ecology, pyrosequencing, climate change, marine sediments,\nbenthic communities\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n54\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne of the greatest scientific challenges currently faced by researchers worldwide is to\n\nunderstand how human activities alter ecosystems and how ecosystems will respond to future\n\nperturbations. A key question is to what extent changes in ocean temperature, acidity and UV\n\nradiation will affect contaminant toxicity and what impact this will have on the marine biota\n\n(Doney, 2010, Hader et al., 2011). Although there is an increased awareness of the potential\n\nfor interactions between climate change and chemical contaminants, we only have a\n\nrudimentary understanding of how multiple stressors interact to affect (communities of)\n\norganisms (Schiedek et al., 2007, Gao et al., 2012, Passow et al., 2012). Thus, it is important that\n\nwe gain a mechanistic understanding of how anthropogenic stressors affect coastal and\n\nestuarine marine ecosystems. These biomes provide valuable ecosystem services such as\n\nfisheries, filtering, detoxification and carbon sequestration. However, they are among the most\n\nimpacted of global ecosystems (Barbier et al., 2010).\n\nThe processes involved in ecosystem response to perturbation often occur over a wide\n\nrange of temporal and spatial scales with unknown interactions, making it difficult to establish\n\ncause-effect relationships in natural systems (Benton et al., 2007). In particular, there is no\n\nstandardized approach for the evaluation of global change effects on different marine\n\necosystems. Small scale models, e.g. microcosms, can be a useful tool to assess such complex\n\nglobal problems (Benton et al., 2007). Microcosms are simplified ecosystems, designed to\n\nsimulate natural environments under controlled conditions (Roeselers et al., 2006). These\n\nmodel systems allow the testing of hypotheses and ecological theories on populations or\n\ncommunities with a high degree of experimental control and replication, which would be very\n\ndifficult to achieve through field observation or in situ experimentation (Benton et al., 2007,\n\nJessup et al., 2004). Moreover, microcosms enable researchers to perform experiments with\n\npotentially toxic contaminants, which would rarely (if ever) be carried out in the field.\n\nIn the present study, we assessed the extent to which microcosm conditions affect the\n\nsediment bacterial communities and the endobenthic species Hediste diversicolor (Mu ?ller, 1776,\n\nformerly known as Nereis diversicolor). Bacterial communities are fundamental players in all\n\nrelevant geochemical cycle. However, despite the overwhelming importance of bacterial\n\nmediated processes, the potential impact of climate change on the composition and activity of\n\nbacterial assemblages is still poorly understood (Reid, 2011). Hediste diversicolor is a key species\n\nin shallow coastal systems: it is omnivorous, an active predator, and is highly prone to\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n55\n\npredation by waders, fish and crabs (Scaps, 2002). This species has been widely used as a\n\nmodel or sentinel organism in the assessment of sub-lethal impact of contaminant in estuaries,\n\nboth in the field and laboratory microcosms (Moreira et al., 2006).\n\nAn important, but often overlooked, prerequisite for performing microcosm\n\nexperiments is to determine whether the structural and functional properties of the source\n\necosystem are well represented in the microcosm, and the extent to which the experimental\n\nresults are biased by the microcosm design and conditions (Leser, 1994). In the present study\n\nour main goals were to develop and evaluate an innovative experimental life support system\n\n(ELSS) designed to: 1) study the interactive effects of multiple stressors on coastal and\n\nestuarine benthic communities, i.e., environmental stressors resulting from climate change and\n\ncontamination; and 2) enable researchers to carry out complex but well replicated\n\nexperiments. We also aimed to develop a versatile system that could be assembled in different\n\nmarine regions across the world using commercially available materials and equipment. The\n\nphysical, chemical and biological parameters of marine environments can be highly variable at\n\nthe regional scale. This variability determines, to a given extent, how intensively global climate\n\nchange affects these environments. Therefore, it is important to develop tools to evaluate the\n\napplicability of current models in predicting changes in local ecosystem health and function.\n\nMethods\n\nELSS basic architecture\n\nThe basic concept of our ELSS was to provide a versatile framework for microcosm\n\nsimulation of climate change scenarios in coastal and estuarine environments that could be\n\neasily replicated around the world. To achieve this goal, the system was developed using: 1)\n\naffordable materials and equipment, which are readily available in local or online stores (Table\n\nIII-S1 for a list of the main material and equipment employed to assemble the ELSS, as well\n\nas their respective suppliers), and 2) a modular construction system that will enable\n\nresearchers to work over a wide range of configurations, thus allowing them to address\n\nspecific research questions using statistically robust experimental designs.\n\nThe ELSS mimics fundamental aspects that condition biological activity in marine\n\necosystems, namely photoperiod, light intensity (including photosynthetically active radiation,\n\nPAR) and tidal cycles. Additionally, it is possible to control temperature, ultraviolet radiation\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n56\n\n(UVR), salinity and pH. The ELSS is composed by two frames of 16 microcosms (32 in total)\n\n(glass tanks 25 cm high, 28 cm length and 12.4 cm width, each with a maximum functional\n\nwater volume of approximately 3 L), which makes it possible to run up to 8 treatments\n\nsimultaneously, each one with a maximum of 4 independent replicates for each treatment. All\n\nreplicates can be arranged in a randomized split-plot design (Figure III-1 and Figure S III-1).\n\nFigure III-1: Experimental life support system (ELSS) general scheme.

The water for tidal cycles is prepared 24 h before use, in order to\n\nallow salt and water to mix. No water recirculation is employed in order to avoid cross\n\ncontamination between experimental treatments and to avoid chemical artefacts that may be\n\npromoted by re-using the same water over time. Thus, the ELSS can be described as a flow-\n\nthrough non-recirculated system operated with synthetic saltwater. Its hydraulic system\n\nenables microcosms to be operated under any desired tidal regime (e.g., diurnal, mixed, semi-\n\ndiurnal). Each tidal regime is controlled as follows: newly prepared synthetic saltwater is\n\npumped (Aquabee UP 3000) into the saltwater reservoirs (Figure III-1, C and D) for pH\n\nadjustment (if necessary); the ELSS is equipped with 4 such reservoirs (each with an\n\napproximate volume of 230 L). For high tide events, saltwater is pumped using a submersible\n\npump (Aquabee UP 3000) from reservoirs C and D (Figure III-1) through an independent\n\npipe system of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes into each microcosm. The saltwater flow rate is\n\nmanually controlled by a PVC valve located above each microcosm (Figure S III-1, S III-2 and\n\nS III-3). Low tide events are simulated using outflow submersible pumps (Rena flow 400 C),\n\noperated with digital timers; each glass tank (the microcosm) is equipped with a single pump\n\npositioned inside a PVC cylinder and protected with a mesh screen (to avoid clogging) (Figure\n\nS III-4). During low tide events the water is discharged from the microcosms through an\n\noutflow pipe, and drained to a collector.\n\npH control system\n\nWater pH can be manipulated by acidifying the water stocked in the tide reservoirs by\n\nbubbling CO2 through a diffuser (Figure S III-5) (Gattuso et al., 2009). The diffuser operates\n\nwith a water pump (Aquabee UP 3000) to maximize CO2 gas mixing in saltwater. CO2\naddition is controlled with a feedback system that includes a combination of a pH electrode\n\nconnected to a controller (V\u00b2 control pH controller, Tropical Marine Centre, UK) and a\n\npressure regulator with an integrated solenoid valve (V\u00b2 pressure regulator pro, Tropical\n\nMarine Centre, UK). The digital display of the controller allows visualization of actual pH in\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n58\n\nthe saltwater reservoirs and pH monitoring with the pH electrode. The controller opens the\n\nsolenoid valve whenever pH rises above the set value; CO2 is then injected until water pH\n\nreturns to the pre-set value. We tested the pH system under the experimental validation\n\nparameters to simulate a pH reduction of 0.3 units. The average pH value measured in low\n\ntide every two days along a week, (Figure SIII-10), was 7.67\u00b1 0.07 (NBS scale).\n\nTemperature control system\n\nIn order to compensate for potential temperature fluctuations during experimental\n\ntrials, namely those promoted by the illumination system implemented in our ELSS (see\n\nbelow), about two thirds of the microcosms height was immersed in one of two main water\n\ntanks (Figure III-1, E1 and E2). These water bath tanks are perforated at the bottom and\n\nconnected through a 40 mm PVC pipe with a valve. The connection between water bath tanks\n\nensures that temperature is the same in all microcosms. For conducting experiments with\n\ndifferent temperatures the connection valve between the water bath tanks can be closed,\n\nallowing the setting of two distinct water temperature treatments. The water in the tanks is\n\ncontinuously pumped by a canister filter pump (SunSun HW-302) through a cooler equipped\n\nwith a thermostat (Teco TR10) set to the desired temperature. The canister filter pump\n\n(composed by mechanical filtration sponges and activated carbon to remove any debris from\n\nthe freshwater in the bath) operates with a flow rate of 1000 L h-1 (Figure S III-6). Four\n\nsubmersible 200 W heaters equipped with thermostats (Rena Cal 200) are placed inside the\n\nwater bath tanks to modify water temperature to previously set values. The simultaneous\n\noperation of the cooling and heating system minimises water temperature fluctuations to \u00b1\n\n0.5\u00baC.\n\nLighting control system\n\nThe ELSS is equipped with 4 ReefSET\u00ae programmable luminaire systems for diurnal\n\nlight cycle and controlled UV simulation. Each luminaire holds 4 UV fluorescent tubes\n\n(SolarRaptor, T5/54W, Germany) and 4 full spectra fluorescent tubes (AquaLight,\n\nT5/54W/10000K,Germany) disposed alternately under a reflector (Figures S III-7 and S III-\n\n8). The luminaire system incorporates a dimming ballast that allows the adjustment of light\n\nintensity by varying the voltage supply. ReefSET\u00ae proprietary software enables the simulation\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n59\n\nof a range of scenarios by varying the percentage of light intensity (see\n\nhttp://www.reefset.com).\n\nWater chemistry analysis\n\nWater samples for dissolved inorganic nutrient (nitrate NO3\n-, ammonium NH4\n\n+ and o-\n\nphosphate PO4\n3-) determination were collected from each microcosm at the beginning of the\n\nexperiment, after 21 days and at the end of the experiment. Water aliquots were immediately\n\nfiltered (Whatman GF/C glass-fibre filter) and stored frozen at -20 \u00baC until analysis. NO3\n-\n\ndetermination followed the 8039 method described in the Hach Spectrophotometer (DR\n\n2000) standard analytical procedures (Hach, USA, DR2000, 44863-00). The determination of\n\nNH4\n+ and PO4\n\n3- concentrations were carried out following standard spectrophotometric\n\nmethods described elsewhere (LimnologiskMetodik, 1992). The analytical quality control was\n\nensured by duplicate samples and by the analysis of blanks between samples.\n\nVisual inspection of NO3\n-, NH4\n\n+ and PO4\n3- histograms revealed significant deviations from\n\nnormal distributions. The distributions remained significantly deviant after logarithmic and\n\nsquare-root transformation. We, therefore, tested for significant differences in dissolved\n\ninorganic nutrient concentration among sampling events using a repeated measures\n\npermutational analysis of variance with the adonis() function (Vegan package) in R\n\n(http://www.r-project.org/; Accessed 4 May 2012). The script used is provided in the\n\nsupporting information.\n\nBiological validation\n\nSediment sampling\n\nFour sediment cores were collected at the east margin of Mira channel (40\u00b037\"N,\n\n8\u00b044\"W), one of the main channels of the Ria de Aveiro lagoon (Portugal) in May 2011. The\n\nRia de Aveiro is a shallow mesotidal coastal lagoon connected with the Atlantic Ocean\n\nthrough a single inlet, and characterized by four main channels with several secondary narrow\n\nchannels, inner basins and extensive intertidal areas (Dias et al., 2001). Several studies have\n\nshown that Ria de Aveiro has a moderate level of eutrophication and low overall human\n\ninfluence when compared to other estuarine systems (Ferreira et al., 2003, Lopes et al., 2007).\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n60\n\nPlexiglass cores of undisturbed sediment samples (10 cm deep, 27 cm length and 10.6 cm\n\nwidth) were collected and each core transferred directly into individual microcosms (4 in total)\n\nof the ELSS (Figure III-1, A) in May 2011. Microcosms containing the sediment were brought\n\nback to the laboratory and connected to the ELSS less than 2 h after sampling. The ELSS was\n\noperated continuously during 57 days.\n\nExperimental validation parameters\n\nThe ELSS system was programmed to simulate the specific seasonal characteristics of\n\nthe coastal lagoon system (Ria de Aveiro) at the sampling site where and when sediment cores\n\nwere collected. Salinity was adjusted to simulate the conditions recorded at the sampling\n\nlocation and kept constant (32.6 \u00b1 1.5) during the experiment, with synthetic saltwater being\n\nprepared as described above in the \u201ctidal cycle and water circulation control system\u201d section.\n\nPrior to each high tide, water salinity was checked. All microcosms were exposed to a uniform\n\nsemi-diurnal tidal regime, experiencing two high tides and two low tides daily. Each tidal cycle\n\ntook approximately 1 min. The duration of each tidal event minimizes pH and salinity\n\nfluctuations between the reservoirs and the microcosms. The minimum and maximum water\n\nlevels above the sediment surface were approximately 5 cm (low tide) and 10 cm (high tide).\n\nDuring each tidal cycle about 50% of the water volume of each microcosm was exchanged\n\n(~1.5 L), thus simulating the water renewal percentage recorded for the central area of the\n\nestuarine system recreated in the ELSS (Ria de Aveiro) (Dias et al., 2001).\n\nWater pH was adjusted to 8.0 and water temperature to 19\u00baC, which corresponds to\n\nthe average values recorded at the sampling location. The average pH monitored in the system\n\nwas 7.97\u00b1 0.07 (NBS scale). With the luminaires system set to its maximum power, the PAR\n\nvalue measured for the full spectrum fluorescent lamps was 260.50 \u00b1 56.30 ?mol photons m-2\n\ns-1, and the UV-A (320-400 nm) irradiance emitted by the UV lamps was 2875.91 \u00b1 264.62\n\nmW m-2 (Lamp spectrum - Figure III-S9, and measurement details can be consulted in\n\nsupporting information). In order to mimic summer photoperiod and light conditions at\n\nPortuguese latitudes during the time of sampling, a 14 hour diurnal light cycle was simulated,\n\nwith light intensity varying from 50% to 100% of the total fluorescent tube intensity (Table II-\n\nS2). Since UV-A radiation is practically unaffected by changes in ozone depletion and plays an\n\nimportant role in biological systems, including photo-repair mechanisms (Bargagli, 2005), a\n\nsimilar amount of UV-A integrated irradiance was maintained constant among microcosms.\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n61\n\nThis was achieved by activating the UV lamps for four h a day at maximum intensity and\n\nfiltering the UV-B component with a glass panel in the luminaires.\n\nProfiling of the active bacterial community\n\nRNA extraction, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and pyrosequencing\n\nFour composite samples each corresponding to four sediment cores (~1 cm of top\n\nsediment with a 1 cm diameter) were obtained in situ (ConBs), and from the microcosm after\n\n21 days (ConIs) and 57 days (ConFs) of operation. Environmental samples were collected at\n\nthe study site, separated from each other by at least 1 m. Microcosm samples were obtained\n\nfrom four independent microcosms. Approximately 1 g of the aerobic sediment layer was\n\ndirectly transferred into a 2.0 ml screw cap tube containing Lysing Matrix E (FastRNA\u00ae Pro\n\nSoil-Direct Kit, Qbiogene Inc.,CA) and immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen (Liu et al.,\n\n2011). Samples were kept at -80\u00ba C until RNA extraction.\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from sediment samples using the FastPrep\u00ae Instrument\n\n(Qbiogene, Inc, CA), for 40 s at a speed setting of 6.0 according to the manufacturer's\n\ninstructions. Residual DNA was removed using Turbo DNA-free kit (Applied Biosystems,\n\nAustin, TX, USA). Total RNA was then converted to single stranded cDNA using random\n\nhexamer-primed reverse transcription by applying SuperScript\u00ae III Reverse Transcriptase Kit\n\n(Invitrogen). The complete removal of DNA was confirmed by PCR. Universal bacterial\n\nprimers U27 and 1492R were used to amplify ca. 1450 bp of the 16S rRNA cDNA (Weisburg\n\net al., 1991). Specific products were detected in cDNA samples after reverse transcription, but\n\nnot in their corresponding source RNA samples (data not shown).\n\nDenaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to monitor structural\n\nvariation in bacterial communities in ConBs, ConIs and ConFs. Briefly, a nested PCR\n\napproach was used to amplify the 16S rRNA gene sequence from the samples. For the first\n\nPCR, the universal bacterial primers U27 and 1492R were used. For the second PCR, 1 ?l of\n\nthe product of the first PCR was used as template with bacterial DGGE primers 968F-GC\n\nand 1401R (ca. 433 bp) (N\u00fcbel et al. 1996). The GC-clamped amplicons were applied to a\n\ndouble-gradient polyacrylamide gel containing 6 to 10% acrylamide (Rotiphorese) with a\n\ngradient of 40 to 58% of denaturants. The run was performed in Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer\n\n(0.5 M Tris-Base, Sigma, 0.05 M EDTA, Sigma; 0.1 M CH3CO2Na, Sigma, pH 8.0) at 60 \u00b0C at\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n62\n\na constant voltage of 220 V for 16 h on a DCode vertical electrophoresis apparatus (universal\n\nmutation detection system; Bio-Rad). The DGGE gels were silver stained (Heuer et al., 2001).\n\nThe processing of the DGGE gels was carried out using the Bionumerics software 6.6\n\n(Applied Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium). A barcoded pyrosequencing approach was used for an in\n\ndepth microbial community analysis of ConBs and ConFs samples. Fragments of the 16S\n\nrRNA (cDNA) were sequenced for each sample with primers V3 Forward (5\u00b4 -\n\nACTCCTACGGGAGGCAG-3\u2019) and V4 Reverse (5\u00b4 - TACNVRRGTHTCTAATYC-3\u2019)\n\nusing the 454 Genome Sequencer FLX Titanium (Life Sciences Roche Diagnostics Ltd, West\n\nSussex, UK). Sequences were analysed with QIIME software package following published\n\nrecommendations (Kuczynski et al., 2011). Details on sequence quality analysis and assignment\n\ncan be found in supporting information. Sequences can be downloaded from the NCBI Short\n\nRead Archive (STUDY SRP013200).\n\nTwo square matrices 1. containing the abundance of all OTUs per sample generated\n\nwith Qiime and 2. containing band 'abundance' based on band intensity and position of the\n\nDGGE gel were imported into R. Both were log10 (x+1) transformed and distance matrices\n\nconstructed using the Bray-Curtis index with the vegdist() function in the vegan package in R\n\n(Oksanen et al., 2008). The Bray-Curtis index is one of the most frequently applied\n\n(dis)similarity indices used in ecology (Legendre et al., 2001, Cleary, 2003, Cleary et al., 2004a,\n\nCleary et al., 2004b, de Voogd et al., 2009). Total rarefied OTU richness per sample was\n\nestimated with a self-written function (Gomes et al., 2010). Variation in OTU composition\n\namong treatments was tested for significance using the Adonis() function. In the Adonis()\n\nanalysis, the Bray-Curtis distance matrix of OTU composition was the response variable with\n\ntreatment as independent variable. The number of permutations was set at 999; all other\n\narguments used the default values set in the function. Variation in the relative abundance of\n\nthe most abundant higher taxa (three most abundant phyla; three most abundant classes and\n\nthe six most abundant orders) was tested for significance with an analysis of deviance using\n\nthe glm() function in R. Since the data was proportional, a glm with the family argument set as\n\nbinomial was first applied. However, the ratio of residual deviance to residual d.f in the\n\nmodels exceeded 1, so the family was set to \u201cquasibinomial\u201d. In the quasibinomial family the\n\ndispersion is not fixed at one so it can model over-dispersion.\n\nHediste diversicolor stocking in microcosms\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n63\n\nIn addition to H. diversicolor, other marine invertebrates (the isopod Cyathura carinata, and the\n\nmudsnail Hydrobia ulvae) were introduced to the microcosms to ensure that all microcosms\n\nwere colonized with meiofauna at minimal density levels. However, for the validation of the\n\nELSS system, only data from H. diversicolor was used as this species has been widely used as a\n\nmodel or sentinel organism to assess contaminant impact in the field and laboratory (Moreira\n\net al., 2006)\n\nInvertebrate collection\n\nThe three invertebrate species were collected in June 2011 at two reference sites\n\nlocated in the Mondego (40\u00ba 08\u2019 N and 8\u00ba 50\u2019 W; C. carinata) and Mira (H. diversicolor and H.\n\nulvae; 37\u00b040\u2019 N and 8\u00b045\u2019 W). More details about the sampling location and procedures can be\n\nfound in supporting information. Hediste diversicolor (7/microcosms), C. carinata (4/microcosm)\n\nand H. ulvae (20/microcosm) were introduced in the microcosm after the 21 day period of\n\nstabilization to the microcosms. These organisms were retrieved from the sediment at the end\n\nof the experiment, counted and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80oC until\n\nfurther analysis. Pools of 2 - 3 ragworms from each microcosm were weighed (fresh weight)\n\nand homogenised in ice-cold phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH=7.0 with 0.1% Triton X-100) (1:5\n\nm/v). Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min. at 4\u00baC and supernatants were\n\ndivided in aliquots and stored at -80 oC.\n\nBiochemical parameters\n\nThe total content in protein of each aliquot was determined spectrophotometrically\n\naccording to Bradford (1976) using bovine ?-globulin as standard. Catalase (CAT) activity\n\nwas measured spectrophotometrically at 240 nm, following Aebi (1984). Superoxide dismutase\n\n(SOD) activity was assessed spectrophotometrically at 505 nm, using the RANSOD\n\n(RANDOXTM) SOD kit and following the procedure described in the manual provided by the\n\nsupplier. Glutatione S-transferase (GST) activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 340\n\nnm following Hadig et al. (1974). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was measured\n\nspectrophotometrically at 414 nm, following Ellman et al. (1961). Enzyme activities were\n\nmeasured in triplicate and expressed in nmol of hydrolyzed substrate per min per mg of\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n64\n\nprotein, except for CAT and SOD. CAT was expressed in ?mol of hydrolyzed substrate per\n\nmin per mg of protein and SOD in units per gram of protein.\n\nLipid peroxidation (LPO) was evaluated through the quantification of by-products of\n\nthe peroxidation of membrane lipids, like malondialdeyde (MDA), after their reaction with 2-\n\nthiobarbituric acid (TBA), following Buege and Aust (1978). The concentration of\n\nthiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS: ?= 1.56x106 M-1cm-1) was measured\n\nspectrophotometrically at 535 nm and expressed in nmols of MDA equivalents per mg of\n\nprotein).\n\nThe average values recorded for each parameter, in the organisms exposed in the\n\nmicrocosm control units, were compared with in situ and laboratory values reported in the\n\nliterature for H. diversicolor, collected in the same estuary during the same period of the year\n\n(Moreira et al., 2006). The values of AChE, CAT, GST, SOD and LPO activity deviated\n\nsignificantly from normality (Shapiro-Wilk normality test, P = 0.046, P &lt;0.001, P = 0.013, P\n\n= 0.007, and P = 0.015, respectively). With the exception of GST after logarithmic\n\ntransformation (Shapiro-Wilk normality test, P = 0.112), the deviations remained significant\n\nafter logarithmic and square-root transformation. GST exhibited homogenous variances\n\nbetween groups (Bartlett test, chi-squared = 1.31, df = 1, P = 0.251). Therefore, AChE, CAT,\n\nGST, SOD and LPO were tested for significant differences between microcosm and reported\n\nvalues in literature using the Adonis() function and tested GST using a Student's t.test(). In the\n\nAdonis() analysis, the Euclidean distance matrix of enzyme activity was the response variable\n\nwith treatment as independent variable. The number of permutations was set at 999; all other\n\narguments used the default values set in the function.\n\nResults and discussion\n\nWater nutrient validation\n\nDuring the experimental period, the concentrations of NO3\n- did not change\n\nsignificantly (repeated measures Adonis, F2,9 = 5.35, R\n2 = 0.543, P = 0.09). NO3\n\n- varied from\n\n29.96 \u00b1 1.10 \u00b5mol l-1 at the beginning, to 42.86 \u00b1 10.1 \u00b5mol l-1 after 21 days and 32.38 \u00b1 1.31\n\n\u00b5mol l-1 at the end of the experiment. NH4\n+ varied from 0.87 \u00b1 0.27 \u00b5mol l-1 at the beginning,\n\n1.35 \u00b1 0.74 \u00b5mol l-1 after 21 days and 1.42 \u00b1 0.48 \u00b5mol l-1 at the end of the experiment. There\n\nwas no significant difference in NH4\n+ concentration between sampling events (Repeated\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n65\n\nmeasures adonis, F2,9 = 1.29, R2 = 0.223, P = 0.27). PO4\n3- varied from 1.07 \u00b1 0.05 \u00b5mol l-1 at\n\nthe beginning to 1.12 \u00b1 0.05 \u00b5mol l-1 after 21 days and 1.07 \u00b1 0.05 \u00b5mol l-1 at the end of the\n\nexperiment (repeated measures Adonis analysis: F2,9 = 1.33, R2 = 0.229, P = 0.35) (Figure S\n\nIII-11). In summary, the environmental range of water parameters (temperature, salinity and\n\npH) and dissolved inorganic nutrients (NO3\n-, NH4\n\n+ and PO4\n3-) measured in our ELSS\n\nvalidation were comparable to those recorded in several Portuguese coastal systems (Table S\n\nIII-3).\n\nBiological validation\n\nSediment bacterial diversity\n\nDGGE fingerprinting was used first as a proxy (Cleary et al., 2012) to assess the effect\n\nof the microcosm on bacterial community structure. Ordination analysis of band profiles\n\nrevealed significant differences (Adonis, F2,9 = 1.58, R\n2 = 0.260, P = 0.007) in composition\n\namong sampling events (Figure S III-12). A 16S RNA cDNA-based barcode pyrosequencing\n\napproach provided a deeper characterization of sediment bacterial communities from ConBs\n\nand ConFs. Barcode pyrosequencing has been successfully used for in-depth studies of\n\nmicrobial diversity in several ecosystems (Roesch et al., 2007, Gomes et al., 2010, Keijser et al.,\n\n2008, Pires et al., 2012). Most sequence-based studies use DNA libraries. However, DNA\n\nfrom dormant cells, \u201cdead\u201d cells or extracellular DNA may bias the results (Urich et al., 2008,\n\nGaidos et al., 2011). RNA cDNA libraries, in contrast, represent more recent activity and allow\n\ninsight into compositional differences and in situ activity of microbial community members in\n\na given setting (Urich et al., 2008). To examine changes in OTU richness occurring during\n\nELSS experiments, rarefaction curves were generated (Figure III-S13) for ConBs and ConFs.\n\nControlling for sample size (n = 1800 sequences), OTU richness varied from 751.75 \u00b1 12.76\n\nin ConBs to 519.64 \u00b1 8.23 in ConFs. Rarefied OTU richness was clearly lower at the end of\n\nthe experiment. Shifts in bacterial community composition were assessed using PCO\n\nordination of bacterial OTUs (97%) (Figure III-S14). Composition differed significantly\n\n(Adonis analysis: F1,6 = 3.89, R\n2 = 0.039, P = 0.025) between sampling events. Most of the\n\nabundant OTUs (large grey circles; ? 50 sequences) were shared between both treatments.\n\nHowever, certain dominant populations (OTUs) showed stronger associations to either\n\nConBs or ConFs samples.\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n66\n\nMicrocosm manipulation affected bacterial composition by reducing the number of\n\nrare OTUs and increasing the abundance of specific OTUs. This probably occurred because\n\nthe microcosm is a more stable and less heterogeneous environment. Reduced disturbance\n\nmay have allowed competitively superior groups to out-compete and effectively eliminate\n\nother species. This phenomenon is in line with the intermediate disturbances hypothesis\n\n(IDH) (Connell, 1978). Such an effect can also occur within different habitats in natural\n\nmarine environments, which are commonly subjected to several levels of heterogeneity and\n\ndisturbance regimes (Gingold et al., 2010). For example, the presence of bioturbating shrimps\n\nin marine sediment habitats has been shown to induce changes in composition of sediment\n\nbacterial communities and increase bacterial diversity (Laverock et al. (2010).\n\nBacterial composition analysis showed that 74.03 \u00b1 4.28% of all reads were assigned\n\nto the Proteobacteria at the beginning of the experiment. This proportion rose to 95.74 \u00b1 1.47%\n\nat the end of the experiment. The different classes of this phylum are often abundant in\n\nmarine sediment (Gomes et al., 2010, Jiang et al., 2009). Within the Proteobacteria, the\n\nGammaproteobacteria was the most dominant class; their relative abundance ranged from 36.39\u00b1\n\n7.08%, at the beginning of the experiment to 47.12\u00b1 4.14% at the end. The\n\nGammaproteobacteria is the largest Proteobacteria group in terms of diversity and includes a wide\n\nrange of phenotypic and metabolic diversity with recognized importance (Kersters et al., 2006).\n\nThe relative abundance of the Deltaproteobacteria class increased significantly after microcosm\n\nmanipulation from 18.60 \u00b1 6.04% at the beginning of the experiment to 42.70 \u00b1 5.25 % at the\n\nend (Anova, F1,6 , P = 0.003). Our results show that this trend was mainly related to an\n\nincrease in the relative abundance of the Desulfobacterales order, which includes anaerobic\n\nsulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) (Figure III-2). SRB play an essential role in a variety of\n\nprocesses in anoxic marine sediment including organic matter turnover, pollutant\n\ndetoxification and the carbon and sulphur cycles (Zhang et al., 2008). SRB use sulphate as an\n\nelectron acceptor in the degradation of organic compounds resulting in the production of\n\nsulphide through the dissimilatory sulphate reduction pathway (Muyzer et al., 2008). Our ELSS\n\nwas set to simulate the central area of the Ria de Aveiro mesotidal system, where\n\napproximately 50% of the water volume is renewed between tides (Dias et al., 2001). However,\n\nthe original sampling site in particular, is subject to intense water renewal, and being at an\n\nintertidal zone, the sediment is exposed to air during low tide. This implies that the\n\nmicrocosms simulated a more anoxic environment than that of the original sampling site,\n\nleading to an increased relative abundance of anaerobic Desulfobacterales. Introduction of\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n67\n\nragworm to the system might also influence bacterial community structure. Although\n\nbioturbation is generally associated with an increase in oxic zones in the sediment, infaunal\n\nactivity can also augment anaerobic processes such as sulphate reduction (Bertics et al., 2010).\n\nFigure III-2: Relative abundance of the most dominant bacterial taxa (three most abundant phylum; three must\nabundant classes and the six must abundant orders) the sediment collected in the environment (ConBs) and from\n\nthe sediment retrieved from the microcosm after 57 days of operation (ConFs). Summary from analysis of\n\ndeviance (glm with \u2018quasibinomial\u2019 family) is indicated above the bars. Note that analyses of deviance was not\n\nperform on Cyanobacteria, since sequences affiliated with this group were not detected in all samples.\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n68\n\nNevertheless, the simulated conditions did not exclude important functional aerobic groups in\n\nsediment biogeochemical processes. The abundance of OTUs belonging to the Methylococcales\n\norder increased after microcosm manipulation from 3.19 \u00b1 3.23% at the beginning of the\n\nexperiment to 13.26 \u00b1 1.60% at the end. This order includes several members that oxidize\n\nmethane under aerobic or microaerobic conditions (Bowman, 2005).\n\nIn contrast to the Deltaproteobacteria, the abundance of Alphaproteobacteria declined from\n\n18.70 \u00b1 12.14% at the beginning of the experiment to 5.36 \u00b1 1.60% at the end. This was\n\nmainly related to a reduction in the abundance of the Rhodobacterales order, which declined\n\nfrom 11.98 \u00b1 11.13% at the beginning of the experiment to 1.08 \u00b1 0.80% at the end. Within\n\nthe Rhodobacterales, several OTUs belonging to the Rhodobacteraceae family were detected.\n\nRhodobacteraceae includes the Roseobacter clade, one of the major marine groups; 20% of coastal\n\nand 15% of mixed-layer ocean bacterioplankton communities consist of members of this\n\nclade (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2005). Given that members of this group are likely present in water,\n\ntheir higher relative abundance in the sediment samples retrieved from the environment could\n\nbe due to near-shore seawater infiltration, thus explaining their reduction following the\n\nmicrocosm experiment. Several phylotypes related to the Roseobacter clade were found in an\n\nendovaporitic microbial mat and the authors attributed this finding to seawater infiltration in\n\nthe mat (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2005). Other less abundant phyla such as Cyanobacteria and\n\nActinobacteria were also less abundant at the end of the experiment.\n\nThe distribution of dominant (? 50 sequences) OTUs across all samples is visualized\n\nusing a heatmap (Figure S III-15). Results from this analysis are in line with the pattern\n\ndetected in the relative abundance analysis. Several abundant OTUs detected at the beginning\n\nof the experiment remained among the most dominant OTUs at the end of the experiment,\n\nincluding several known aerobic and anaerobic groups (e.g., Gammaproteobacteria \u2013 OTU 2987,\n\nOTU 2315, OTU 3254; Deltaproteobacteria - Desulfobacteraceae \u2013 OTU 3129; Methylococcales -\n\n1648). As outlined above, several sulphate reducing bacterial OTUs increased their abundance\n\nin microcosm samples (e.g., Desulfobacteraceae OTUs \u2013 1724; 1325), whereas members of the\n\nRhodobacterales order declined in abundance at the end of the experiment (e.g., OTUs - 1569;\n\n675).\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n69\n\nHediste diversicolor biochemical parameters\n\nHediste diversicolor has been indicated as an adequate sentinel species for transitional\n\nwaters due to its wide distribution, sensitivity and its role in the functioning and structure of\n\nmarine ecosystems (Scaps, 2002, Moreira et al., 2006, Bouraoui et al., 2009, Sol\u00e9 et al., 2009).\n\nRagworms usually move actively around the sediment surface or within their burrow systems\n\nlooking for food (Kristensen, 2001). Furthermore, these organisms are both sediment eaters\n\n(Sol\u00e9 et al., 2009) and suspension feeders (Kristensen, 2001 and references cited), features that\n\nincrease the chances of exposure to contaminants associated with different sediment\n\ncomponents, overlying water and interstitial water.\n\nAt the end of the experiment 96.40% of stocked H. diversicolor were recovered,\n\nindicating that the architecture and the conditions of the system did not compromise the\n\nsurvival of these organisms even during long-lasting exposure. Figure III-3 shows boxplots for\n\nvalues recorded for each biochemical parameter monitored for H. diversicolor specimens\n\nstocked in the microcosms of our ELSS, as well as ranges of values available in the study of\n\nMoreira et al. (2006) for this species, collected in the same estuary and in the same period of\n\nthe year. The comparability with organisms collected at the same period of the year is of\n\nparticular importance as the influence of seasonal (e.g., water temperature) factors,\n\nphysiological factors, sexual condition, gametogenesis period and behaviour in antioxidant\n\nenzyme levels is well known (Sun et al., 2008). Compared to the previous study of Moreira et\n\nal. (2006), no significant differences were observed in the activity of AChE (Adonis, F1,7 =\n\n0.89, R2 = 0.113, P = 0.380;  F1,17 = 1.75, R\n2 = 0.094, P = 0.174, comparing with in situ and\n\nlaboratory data from Moreira et al., 2006, respectively), thus, denoting no neurologic adverse\n\neffects of microcosm exposure in the polychaete. The activity of CAT and GST were\n\nsignificantly higher in the present study in comparison to results obtained by Moreira et al.\n\n(2006) (Adonis for CAT: F1,7 = 6.66, R\n2 = 0.487, P = 0.061;  F1,17 = 16.67, R\n\n2 = 0.495, P =\n\n0.002 and Student-t test for GST: t4,5 =5.6, p<0.001 and t4,15 = 5.6, p<0.001, respectively, when\n\ncompared with laboratory and in situ data for each enzyme). However, the differences\n\nregistered in GST activity between the present work and the results obtained by Moreira et al.\n\n(2006) with organisms exposed, under controlled condition, in the laboratory was 22%, which\n\nis close to the 20% threshold commonly considered to be within the normal range of activity\n\nof the enzyme and to have no biological significance (Olsen et al., 2001). The activity measured\n\nfor SOD and LPO in H. diversicolor exposed in the ELSS was significantly lower than that\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n70\n\nreported by the latter authors (Adonis for SOD: F1,7 = 339.25, R2 = 0.979, P = 0.008;  F1,17 =\n\n846.06, R2 = 0.980, P = 0.001 and Adonis for LPO: F1,7 = 78.79, R2 = 0.918, P = 0.008;  F1,17\n= 100.04, R2 = 0.855, P = 0.001). These observations indicate that the organisms were not\n\nunder neurologic or oxidative stress. The apparent depression in SOD activity may also have\n\nbeen the result of the different methods applied to assess this enzyme in both studies.\n\nFigure III-3: Boxplot of the values recorded for each biochemical parameter measured in Hediste diversicolor\nafter 36 days in the microcosms (ConF) and reported in the literature for in situ (Envir) and laboratory values\n\n(LabEx) of the same species collected at the same site and season (Moreira et al., 2006). The boxed area\n\nrepresents the mean \u00b1 quartile and the whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum values.\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n71\n\nTemperature and the sediment sulphide content have been pointed out as factors responsible\n\nfor the induction of SOD activity in H. diversicolor, while anoxia seems to have a non\n\nsignificant effect on the activity of this enzyme (Abele-Oeschger et al., 1994, Sun et al., 2008).\n\nThus, the lower temperature to which the ragworms have been exposed in the microcosm, in\n\ncomparison to the field conditions, may have been responsible for the depression in SOD\n\nactivity. Temperature effect is also likely to affect the activity of the other tested enzymes,\n\nsince a similar decreasing trend has been reported for antioxidant enzyme activities in\n\ninvertebrate species with decreasing temperatures (Khessiba et al., 2005; Sroda and Cossu-\n\nLeguille, 2011; Kong et al., 2012). However, the temperatures that produced a significant\n\nreduction in the activity of stress biomarkers in the referenced studies were lower than those\n\nrecorded in the ELSS, and in some cases variation with temperature displayed a sex-dependent\n\ntendency (Sroda and Cossu-Leguille, 2011). Similarly, contradictory relationships between\n\ntemperature and SOD activity in H. diversicolor have been reported (Abele-Oeschger et al.,\n\n1994, Sun et al., 2008). Although the ELSS appeared to induce anaerobic conditions, a\n\nsulphide rich environment and promote the abundance of SRB, our results failed to show\n\noxidative stress induction in ragworms.\n\nExperimental life support system applications\n\nIn this study we have described the development and validation of an experimental\n\nmicrocosm framework capable of simulating fundamental dynamics of coastal systems. Water\n\ninorganic nutrient concentrations remained fairly stable during validation trials, exhibiting\n\ncomparable values to those recorded in the coastal lagoon. Bacterial community structure\n\nvalidation revealed that the microcosm operational programme introduced a shift that\n\nfavoured the SRB group in particular. However, these changes do not necessarily imply a\n\nstrong shift in community functioning, given that the most abundant classes were still\n\ndetected in samples at the end of the experiment. Nevertheless, if deemed necessary, aerobic\n\nconditions can be stimulated by choosing different tidal ranges with different percentages of\n\nwater renewal. At the end of the validation period, the biomarkers of H. diversicolor were within\n\nthe same magnitude of values reported in the literature for organisms collected in the same\n\nestuary, under reference conditions.\n\nThe ELSS described here can be easily reproduced and operated under a moderate\n\nbudget. We estimated that the replication of this system would cost approximately 15000\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n72\n\neuros. Assuming 0.098 euros per Kilowatt hour-1 (average price of electricity for industry in\n\nthe European Union for the second semester 2012 -\n\nhttp://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=nrg_pc_205&amp;lang=en), a daily\n\noperational cost of approximately 4.09 euros was estimated. If necessary, the system\n\narchitecture is sufficient flexible to allow for the replacement of several subsystems in order to\n\nfit specific research needs. Its modular construction enables the setting of a multitude of\n\nstatistically robust complex experimental designs. By changing the pre-sets of the ELSS values\n\nwith respect to temperature and pH subsystems, it is possible to simulate several scenarios of\n\nglobal climate change, such as the postulated increase in temperature and reduction in pH  in\n\nmarine environments. If users choose to use natural seawater and operate under a closed\n\nrecirculated water system, it is important that other parameters related to inorganic C species,\n\nsuch as dissolved inorganic carbon or total alkalinity, are monitored since carbonate chemistry\n\ncan be affected. Irradiance values can also be manipulated by varying lamp intensity and time\n\nof operation. For example, scenarios predicting an increase in UV-B can be simulated by\n\nsimply removing the glass filter used in our validation trials and by manipulating lamp\n\nintensity.\n\nThis system can be used to establish cause-effect relationships on the impact of\n\nclimate change and other anthropogenic stressors on coastal marine benthic communities and\n\nprocesses. For example, the ELSS could be used to study bacterial mediated degradation (e.g.,\n\npetroleum hydrocarbon degradation) in coastal systems under various climate change\n\nscenarios. Hediste diversicolor stress indicators could then be applied to assess the toxicity of\n\ndegradation products. The data thus obtained can provide the basis for our understanding\n\nhow climate change and pollution may interact to affect coastal marine ecosystems in the\n\nfuture.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nThis work was supported by the Center for Environmental and Marine Studies (CESAM), the\n\nFoundation for Science and Technology (FCT, Portugal) PTDC/AAC-CLI/107916/2008\n\n(http://alfa.fct.mctes.pt) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through\n\nCOMPETE-(FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-008657).

In order to achieve a\n\npH reduction of 0.3 in each microcosm, the acidified reservoir water was adjusted to a pH value of 7.2.\n\nCollection of invertebrates and microcosm exposure\n\nThe invertebrate species were collected by hand, at the low tide (H. diversicolor and H.\n\nulvae at a salinity of 33-35 and water temperature 23oC and C. carinata at a salinity of 30 and\n\nwater temperature 21\u00baC) 21 days after the beginning of the experiment, and transported to the\n\nlaboratory in plastic containers filled with local water. In the laboratory the organisms were\n\nseparated from debris and a pool of organisms with a similar body size, for each species, was\n\nobtained. From this pool, 30 organisms, for H. diversicolor and H. ulvae, were randomly chosen\n\nfor the evaluation of their biomass, as dry weight. For dry weight estimations, organisms were\n\nleft in filtered (10 \u00b5m) local water for 24 h, time after which they were dried at 60oC for 72 h.\n\nThe dry weight was then estimated to the nearest 0.01 g (Kern ALS-A, Kern and Sohn,\n\nBalingen, Germany). Mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) biomass of organisms to be used was 15\n\n(\u00b14.7) mg for H. diversicolor and 0.90 (\u00b14.7) mg for C. carinata. For H. ulvae (n = 30), organisms\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n92\n\nwith a shell length and width of 5.28 (\u00b10.35) mm and 2.61 (\u00b10.20) mm, respectively, were\n\nused. Organisms to be used in the microcosm were randomly distributed into groups of seven,\n\ntwenty and four, respectively for H. diversicolor, H. ulvae and C. carinata (corresponding,\n\nrespectively, to a density of 0.03, 0.09, and 0.02 organisms cm2, thus, avoiding stress due to\n\noverloading of the system, as this density is below the densities observed at the Mira estuary\n\nand those reported in literature to induce stress due to overloading-approximately 0.8 and 1.8\n\norganisms cm2 (Costa et al., 2001, Barnes, 2001) and maintained in 50 ml polypropylene vials\n\nfilled with local estuarine water, at 19 to 21\u00baC under a photoperiod of 16hL:8hD. The day the\n\nexperiment was started, i.e., approximately 24 h after being collected, groups of seven worms,\n\ntwenty mudsnails and four isopods were placed into four microcosm independent control\n\nunits in contact with the sediment (see previous material and methods sections).\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n93\n\nValidation of inorganic nutrient concentration in water\n\nFigure S III-11: Concentration of dissolved inorganic nutrients (nitrate NO3-; ammonium NH4+ and o-\n\nphosphate PO43-) in water ELSS control at the beginning of the experiment, after 21 days (ConIw) and at the end\n\nof the experiment.\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n94\n\nT\nab\n\nle\n S\n\nII\nI-\n\n3:\nT\n\nhe\n e\n\nnv\niro\n\nnm\nen\n\nta\nl r\n\nan\nge\n\n o\nf \n\nw\nat\n\ner\n p\n\nar\nam\n\net\ner\n\ns \n(te\n\nm\npe\n\nra\ntu\n\nre\n, s\n\nal\nin\n\nity\n a\n\nnd\n p\n\nH\n), \n\nan\nd \n\nof\n d\n\nis\nso\n\nlv\ned\n\n in\nor\n\nga\nni\n\nc \nnu\n\ntr\nie\n\nnt\ns \n\n(n\nitr\n\nat\ne \n\nN\nO\n\n3-\n,\n\nam\nm\n\non\niu\n\nm\n N\n\nH\n4+\n\nan\nd \n\no-\nph\n\nos\nph\n\nat\ne \n\nPO\n43\n\n- ) \nin\n\n P\nor\n\ntu\ngu\n\nes\ne \n\nco\nas\n\nta\nl s\n\nys\nte\n\nm\ns \n\nan\nd \n\nin\n th\n\ne \nE\n\nLS\nS \n\nm\nic\n\nro\nco\n\nsm\ns \n\n(c\non\n\ntr\nol\n\n e\nxp\n\ner\nim\n\nen\nta\n\nl u\nni\n\nts\n).\n\n*V\nal\n\nue\ns \n\nin\nfe\n\nrr\ned\n\n fr\nom\n\n c\nha\n\nrt\ns; \n\n**\n(N\n\nO\nx)\n\n; *\n**\n\nD\nIN\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n95\n\nProfilling of the active bacterial community\n\n16S rRNA sequence analysis\n\nOnly sequences containing exact matches to primer sequences and barcode tags were\n\nused for further analysis. Raw sequencing reads were quality trimmed according to published\n\nrecommendations (Kuczynski et al., 2011) and the QIIME software package\n\n(http://qiime.sourceforge.net/; Accessed 8 October 2012) was applied to analyze the results\n\nof the runs. The \u2018pick_otus.py\u2019 function in QIIME with the usearch quality filter and the\n\ndefault sequence similarity threshold of 0.97 was used to assign sequences to operational\n\ntaxonomic units (OTUs). The usearch quality filter is a pipeline script developed using\n\nUSEARCH to perform filtering of noisy sequences, chimera check and OTU picking\n\n(http://qiime.org/tutorials/usearch_quality_filter.html; Accessed 8 October 2012). Chimera\n\nfilter was performed de novo using UCHIME and against a reference database. UCHIME has\n\nbetter sensitivity than the previously most sensitive database method ChimeraSlayer and is\n\nmore than 1000 times faster (Edgar et al., 2011).\n\nA representative OTU set was chosen with the \u2018pick_rep_set.py\u2019 function using the\n\n'most abundant' method. Sequences belonging to the representative set were classified\n\ntaxonomically with the \u2018assign_taxonomy.py\u2019 function in QIIME with the Naive Bayesian\n\nrRNA RDP Classifier method and 80% minimum confidence score. Chimeric sequences,\n\nplant organelles or sequences not classified as Bacteria (e.g., Archaea) were removed prior to\n\nstatistical analysis. The \u2018make otu_table.py\u2019 function in QIIME was used to generate a square\n\nmatrix containing the abundance of all OTU's per sample that was used in subsequent\n\nanalysis.\n\nAfter quality screening with QIIME pipeline a total of 26252 sequences,\n\ncorresponding to 3658 OTU\u00b4s, were identified in sediment control samples from the\n\nenvironment and from the microcosm. Per sample, sequences ranged from 1819 in Con2B to\n\n4830 in Con3F, corresponding to 534 and 1305 OTU\u00b4s, respectively.\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n96\n\n?0.4 ?0.2 0.0 0.2\n\n?0\n.4\n\n?0\n.3\n\n?0\n.2\n\n?0\n.1\n\n0.\n0\n\n0.\n1\n\n0.\n2\n\n0.\n3\n\nAxis 1\n\nA\nxi\n\ns\n2\n\n?\n\n? ?\n\n?\n\nConB_1s\n\nConB_2s\nConB_3s\n\nConB_4s\n\nConI_1s\n\nConI_2s ConI_3s\n\nConI_4s\n\nConF_1s\n\nConF_2s\n\nConF_3s\n\nConF_4s\n\nFigure S III-12: Principal coordinates analysis of denaturing-gradient gel\n\nelectrophoresis fingerprints of 16S rRNA gene fragments amplified at time 0 (ConBs),\n\n21 days (ConIs) and 57 days (ConFs)\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n97\n\nFigure S III-13: Rarefied OTU richness as a function of the number of sequences from ConBs\n(environment) and ConFs (microcosm) samples.\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities\n\n98\n\nFigure S III-14: Principal coordinates analysis of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) composition.

Gomes\n\nAbstract: There is near unanimous consensus that climate change has the potential to alter marine ecosystems.\nHowever, researchers are still far from understanding the extent and consequences (if any) of climate change\n\ninteractions with other anthropogenic stressors. Due to its complex nature, the effects of climate change (e.g.\n\nocean acidification) and other anthropogenic stressors have mainly been accessed independently. A possible\n\nway of understanding these interactions is through experimentation under well-controlled conditions. With this\n\nwork we demonstrate that the combination of reduced water pH and oil contamination can alter the structure\n\nof the active bacterial communities of shallow estuarine sediment. Anaerobic sulphate reducing bacteria\n\ndrastically reduced their relative abundance under oil contamination and pH values projected for the end of this\n\ncentury. 16S RNA (cDNA) based predicted metagenome suggested that several oil contaminant degradation\n\npathways could be affected in these conditions. Taken together, these results indicate that in future ocean\n\nreduced pH conditions the impact of an oil spill can be substantially different than under current pH levels.\n\nKeywords; microbial ecology; pyrosequencing; climate change\n\nIntroduction\n\nMarine environments are exposed to a range of factors that are fundamentally\n\naltering the chemistry of the ocean at unprecedented rates (Doney 2010). Since the beginning\n\nof the industrial revolution, human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, have\n\nincreased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) from approximately 280 ppmv (parts per\n\nmillion volume) (Inderm\u00fchle et al., 1999) to nearly 394 ppmv in 2012 (NOAA Earth System\n\nResearch Laboratory, 2012).\n\nBetween one-quarter to a one-third of the excess CO2 has been absorbed by the\n\noceans, reducing seawater pH and inducing modifications in fundamental chemical balances\n\nbetween inorganic carbon species (Sabine et al., 2004, Richard et al., 2009). This process,\n\nknown as ocean acidification, is often referred to as \u201cthe other CO2 problem\u201d (Doney et al.,\n\n\n\nOcean acidification and oil contamination have a synergistic effect on microbial composition\n\n106\n\n2009). The magnitude of this process is such that modelled predictions on the disruption of\n\nthe ocean carbonate chemistry have no parallel in the past 300 million years of earth\u00b4s\n\ngeological record (H\u00f6nisch et al., 2012).\n\nThe implementation of the Montreal protocol has successfully reduced ozone-\n\ndepleting substances (Mckenzie et al., 2011). However, increasing concentrations of\n\ngreenhouse gases are expected to interact with ozone and alter its spatial distribution and\n\nexchanges between the stratosphere and troposphere, with potential effects on UVR levels\n\nthat reach the earth (Bais et al., 2011). Furthermore, warming, acidification and changes in\n\nocean stratification patterns are also expected to increase the penetration of UVR in the\n\nwater column and enhance organism exposure to UV-B in forthcoming years (UNEP 2010).\n\nIn addition to the effects on the global climate system, human activities such as fossil\n\nfuel combustion, fertilizer use, and industrial activity have been seriously and adversely\n\naffecting coastal and open-ocean environments for decades, as they cause a continuous\n\ninflux of pollutants (including oil hydrocarbons, pesticides and heavy metals) (Doney 2010).\n\nOil hydrocarbons (OH) are probably one of the most widespread pollutants in oceans\n\nworldwide. The Deepwater Horizon tragic accident alone released an estimated volume of\n\n4.4\u00d7106 \u00b1 20% barrels of oil (7.0\u00d7105 m3) into the ocean (Crone and Tolstoy 2010).\n\nBoth ocean acidification and UVR have the potential to interact with other\n\nanthropogenic stressors such as oil hydrocarbons leading to changes in marine ecosystems\n\n(Fabry et al., 2008, Hader et al., 2011). However, we still lack a fundamental knowledge on\n\nhow these stressors will interact, compromising our ability to predict sudden contamination\n\nimpacts in future ecosystems. Understanding the impacts of these interactions on microbial\n\ncommunities and microbial mediated biogeochemical processes is fundamental to determine\n\nhow ecosystems will react. Microbial communities and their activities drive important\n\necosystem functions. For example, the ability of bacteria to use OH as a carbon and energy\n\nsource greatly influences the environmental detoxification of an oil spill (Head et al., 2006).\n\nWe hypothesized that the impact of an oil spill in marine ecosystems causes a significant shift\n\non microbial communities under increased UV-B and reduced water pH. We tested this\n\nhypothesis by characterizing the independent and interactive effect of these stressors on\n\nestuarine sediment microbial communities using an experimental life support system (ELSS).\n\nThis system allows simulating coastal and estuarine ecosystems and has been previously\n\nvalidated to simulate climate change scenarios on benthic communities (Coelho et al., in\n\npress).\n\n\n\nOcean acidification and oil contamination have a synergistic effect on microbial composition\n\n107\n\nMethods\n\nAromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon analysis\n\nAliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons were determined using a soxhlet extraction\n\nfollowed by a GC-MS analysis (Yan et al., 2009). Approximately 5 g of sediment were\n\ncollected from oil contaminated treatments (OnOi, UVOi, pHOi and UVTot) and from\n\ncontrol treatments (Cont). The sediment was homogenized and freeze-dried before\n\nextraction. The sediment was spiked with 25 \u00b5l (2 \u00b5g/ml) deuterated recovery surrogate\n\nstandards (Supelco) containing naphthalene-d8, acenapthlene-d10, phenanthrene-d10,\n\nchrysene-d12 and perylene-d12 and soxhlet extracted with 150 ml dicloromethane for 24 h\n\nnaphthalene-d8, acenapthlene-d10, phenanthrene-d10, chrysene-d12 and perylene-d12 and\n\nsoxhlet extracted with 150 ml dicloromethane for 24 h (Yan et al. 2009). The first fraction,\n\ncorresponding to aliphatic hydrocarbons, was eluted with 15 ml of n-hexane. The second\n\nfraction, containing PAH compounds, was collected by eluting 30 ml of n-\n\nhexane/dichloromethane (1:1, v:v). The two fractions were combined for analysis. The\n\ndetermination of the two hydrocarbons fraction was performed on a Network GC system\n\n6890/5973 (Agilent Technologies, USA) mass spectrometer with a 30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 \u00b5m\n\nfilm thickness VF-5MS fused silica column in the selective ion mode (SIM) for aromatic\n\nhydrocarbons or in scanning mode for aliphatic hydrocarbons. More details can be found in\n\nhydrocarbon analysis section in supporting information.\n\nActive bacterial community profiling\n\nFour composite samples consisting of four sediment cores (~1 cm of top sediment\n\nwith a 1 cm diameter) were collected in the microcosms after 57 days of operation.\n\nApproximately 1 g of the sediment layer was directly transferred into a 2.0 ml screw cap tube\n\ncontaining Lysing Matrix E (FastRNA\u00ae Pro Soil-Direct Kit, Qbiogene Inc.,CA) and\n\nimmediately immerse in liquid nitrogen (Liu et al. 2011). Samples were kept at -80 \u00baC until the\n\nRNA extraction.\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from sediment samples using the FastPrep\u00ae Instrument\n\n(Qbiogene, Inc, CA), for 40 s at a speed setting of 6.0 according to the manufacturer's\n\ninstructions. Residual DNA was removed using Turbo DNA-free kit (Applied Biosystems,\n\n\n\nOcean acidification and oil contamination have a synergistic effect on microbial composition\n\n108\n\nAustin, TX, USA). Total RNA was then converted to single stranded cDNA using random\n\nhexamer-primed reverse transcription by applying SuperScript\u00ae III Reverse Transcriptase\n\nKit (Invitrogen). The complete removal of DNA was confirmed by PCR. Universal bacterial\n\nprimers U27 and 1492R were used to amplify ca. 1450 bp of the 16S rRNA gene (Weisburg\n\net al., 1991). Specific products were detected in cDNA samples after reverse transcription,\n\nbut not in their corresponding source RNA samples (data not shown).\n\nA barcoded pyrosequencing approach was used for microbial community analysis.\n\nFragments of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene were sequenced for each sample with\n\nprimers V3 Forward (5\u2019-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAG-3\u2019) and V4 Reverse (5\u2019-\n\nTACNVRRGTHTCTAATYC-3\u2019) using the 454 Genome Sequencer FLX Titanium (Life\n\nSciences Roche Diagnostics Ltd, West Sussex, UK). Only sequences containing exact\n\nmatches to primer sequences and barcode tags were used for further analysis.\n\nSequence Analysis\n\nRaw sequencing reads were quality trimmed according to published\n\nrecommendations (Kuczynski et al. 2011) and the QIIME software package\n\n(http://qiime.org; Accessed 4 May 2012) was applied to analyze the results of the runs.\n\nSequences can be downloaded from the NCBI ShortRead Archive, accession numbers (study\n\naccession number - SRP021163). The \u2018pick_otus.py\u2019 function in QIIME with the uclust\n\nmethod and the default sequence similarity threshold of 0.97 was used to assign sequences to\n\noperational taxonomic units (OTUs). A representative OTUs set was chosen with the\n\n\u2018pick_rep_set.py\u2019 function using the 'most abundant' method. Sequences belonging to the\n\nrepresentative set were classified taxonomically with the \u2018assign_taxonomy.py\u2019 function in\n\nQIIME with the Naive Bayesian rRNA RDP Classifier method and 80% minimum\n\nconfidence score. Chimeric sequences (identified using the parallel identify chimeric \u2018seqs.py\u2019\n\nfunction in QIIME), plant organelles or sequences not classified as Bacteria (e.g., Archaea)\n\nwere removed prior to statistical analysis. The \u2018make otu_table.py\u2019 function in QIIME was\n\nused to generate a square matrix containing the abundance of all OTUs per sample that was\n\nused in subsequent analysis.\n\nTotal rarefied OTUs richness per sample was estimated with a self-written function\n\n(Gomes et al., 2010) in R (http://www.r-project.org/; Accessed 6 January 2013). Rarefied\n\nOTUs richness was selected for a minimum sampling size of 1800 sequences. Shapiro-Wilk\n\n\n\nOcean acidification and oil contamination have a synergistic effect on microbial composition\n\n109\n\ntest() was used to test for normality and Bartlett test() was used to test the assumption of\n\nhomogenous variance. Analysis of variance (Anova) was then used to test if rarefied richness\n\ndiffered significantly between treatments. Variation in OTUs composition among treatments\n\nwas tested for significance using the adonis() function in vegan (Oksanen et al., 2012). In the\n\nAdonis analysis, the Bray-Curtis distance matrix of OTUs composition was the response\n\nvariable with treatment as independent variable. The number of permutations was set at 999.\n\nThe argument strata was included to allow randomizations only within each luminaire\n\n(Oksanen et al. 2012). Variation in composition among treatments was assessed with\n\nPrincipal Coordinates Analysis (PCO), using the cmdscale() function in the R base package\n\nand wascores() function in vegan. Prior to the PCO, the raw data was log10 (x+1)\n\ntransformed and used to produce a distance matrix based on the Bray-Curtis distance with\n\nthe vegdist() function in vegan.\n\nWe used Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of\n\nUnobserved Sates (PICRUST-http://picrust.github.com/picrust/Accessed 24 January 2013)\n\nsoftware package to predict the metagenome functional content from the 16S rRNA dataset.\n\nThe \u2018pick_reference_otus_through_otu_table.py\u2019 was used to pick OTU\u00b4s against a reference\n\ncollection with OTU\u00b4s assigned at a 97% similarity. The OTU table obtained was then\n\nnormalize dividing each OTU by the know/predicted 16S copy number with\n\n\u2018normalize_by_copy_number.py\u2019 function. The \u2018predict_metagenomes.py\u2019 function was used\n\nto create a square matrix, containing normalized OTU abundance multiply by each predicted\n\nfunctional trait abundance per sample, that was used in subsequent analysis.\n\nVariation in OTUs and KO relative abundances was analyzed with a mixed-model\n\napproach, treating oil, UV-B and reduced pH as fixed effects and the luminaires as the\n\nrandom effect. Since we wanted to examine the interaction between oil, UV-B and pH we\n\nincluded an interaction term. The mixed-model was fitted using glmer function in the lme4\n\npackage with family argument set to binomial (Bates et al., 2011). Overdispersion was\n\naccounted for by including individual level variability as a random effect (Bates et al., 2011).\n\nThe significance on the main effects and interaction terms was tested using the z -statistics.\n\nWith this approach pseudo-replication was accounted for (i.e. oil contamination, reduced\n\nwater pH and UV-B treatment split within four luminaires).\n\nResults and discussion\n\n\n\nOcean acidification and oil contamination have a synergistic effect on microbial composition\n\n110\n\nSample Collection and Experimental Manipulation\n\nA fully factorial experiment was designed using 32 independent microcosms with\n\nthree treatments: UV-B radiation, water pH and OH contamination. Each treatment had two\n\nlevels: UV-B (with and without), pH (normal and reduced) and Oil (with and without). The\n\ntreatments were replicated into four random independent microcosms and arranged in a\n\nrandomized split-plot design with UV-B as the whole plot and pH and oil at the sub-plot\n\nlevels. The design enabled us to distinguish 8 distinct groups. These groups included 1. Cont\n\n(no UV-B, normal pH and no oil), 2. OnpH (no UV-B, reduced pH, no oil), 3. OnUV (UV-\n\nB, normal pH and no oil), 4. UVpH (UV-B, reduced pH, no oil), 5. OnOi (no UV-B, normal\n\npH, oil), 6. UVOi (UV-B, normal pH, oil), 7. pHOi (no UV-B, reduced pH, oil) and finally 8.\n\nUVTot (UV-B, reduced pH, oil). The experiment was divided into two phases. In the first\n\nphase, the sediment was stabilized during 22 days. In this phase pH was gradually reduced in\n\nreduced pH treatments while the UV-B system operated with the same intensity during all\n\nthe experiment. The second phase started on day 22, with the simulation of an oil spill by\n\npouring oil into oil contaminated treatments. This phase lasted 35 days, until we visually\n\nconfirmed the degradation of the most part of the oil from the water surface. Polycyclic\n\naromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon analysis from sediment collected from oil contaminated\n\nand control treatments did not reveal significant differences (Figure S IV-1) and S IV-2),\n\nfurther suggesting that most of the oil hydrocarbons were already degraded at this time.\n\nThe microcosms were subjected to a uniform semi-diurnal tidal regime, experiencing\n\ntwo high tides and two low tides daily. Water pH was manipulated by bubbling CO2 into\n\nwater (Gattuso and Lavigne 2009) reservoirs prior addition into the microcosms. The\n\nacidified water was supplied with a pH value of 7.2 to the microcosms in each high tide. The\n\nsediment carbonate chemistry impacted the water pH that tended to increase along each tide.\n\nNonetheless, the minimum pH reduction in relation to control microcosms was 0.3, which\n\nfalls within the 0.3-0.4 pH reduction modeled for global sea surface for the year 2100\n\n(Caldeira et al., 2003). The average pH was 7.64\u00b10.11 in acidified microcosms (measured at\n\nthe end of each low tide, before the addition of new acidified water) and 7.95 \u00b10.09 in the\n\ncontrol microcosms (Figure S IV-3).\n\nA constant UV-B irradiance of 1426.36\u00b193.32 mWm-2, during 4 h per day around\n\nnoontime, was used in microcosms with UV-B. This value is similar to the typical DNA-\n\ndamaging UV dose observed in Lisbon in June. Since UV-A radiation is practically\n\n\n\nOcean acidification and oil contamination have a synergistic effect on microbial composition\n\n111\n\nunaffected by changes in ozone depletion and plays an important role in photo-repair\n\nmechanisms (Bargagli 2005), a similar amount of UV-A integrated irradiance of\n\n2875.91\u00b1264.62 mWm-2 was supplemented to the microcosms.\n\nActive bacterial community\n\nThe active bacterial community from each treatment was characterized by using a\n\nbarcoded pyrosequencing approach of the bacterial 16S rRNA (cDNA) gene. Sequences\n\nwere assign to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on their sequence similarity with a\n\ncut off value of 97% (Roesch et al., 2007). To examine changes in OTUs richness, rarefaction\n\ncurves were generated for all treatments (Figure S IV-5). Controlling for sampling size (n=\n\n1800 sequences) rarefied OTUs richness varied from 490\u00b168.52 for OnOi, to 557\u00b148.68 for\n\nOnUV (Figure S IV-3). No significant differences in OTUs richness were detected between\n\ntreatments (Anova, F7,24 = 1.29, R\n2 = 0.868, P = 0.54). On the contrary, there was a\n\nsignificant variation in OTUs composition between treatments (Adonis analysis: F7,31 =\n\n1.563, R2 =0.313, P<0.001). A principal coordinate analysis (PCO) using the Bray-Curtis\n\ndistance of OTUs composition was applied to visualize the dissimilarities between the\n\ndifferent treatments (Figure IV-1).\n\nFigure IV-1: Principal coordinates analysis of operational taxonomic unit  (OTU) composition. The first two axes are\nshown based on a matrix of OTU composition. Cont - control with no treatment; OnpH - reduced pH; OnUV -\nexposed to UV-B; UVpH - reduced pH and UV-B exposed; OnOi - contaminated with oil; UVOi - contaminated with\noil and exposed to UV-B; pHOi - contaminated with oil and reduced pH; UVTot - contaminated with oil and exposed\nto UV-B and reduced pH.\n\n\n\nOcean acidification and oil contamination have a synergistic effect on microbial composition\n\n112\n\nThe primary and secondary axis of variation was between the Cont group and the samples\n\nretrieved from the pHOi group. UVTot group also exhibited a variation from other groups,\n\nalthough less pronounced than pHOi. Using the RDP classifier, with a confidence threshold\n\nof 80%, 128313 out of 129282 (99.25%) qualified sequences were assigned to known phyla.\n\nProteobacteria was the most represented phylum varying from 95.92\u00b11.35% of total identified\n\nOTUs in OnOi to 88.55\u00b15.20% in pHOi group. We therefore, tested the interactive effect\n\nof oil, pH and UV-B on the relative abundance of the three most representative Proteobacteria\n\ngroups classified at order level (Figure IV-2). Together, these four groups varied from\n\n76.12\u00b19.91% in pHOi to 87.21\u00b12.39% in Cont (The relative abundance of all Proteobacteria\n\norders is available in supportive information Figure S IV-8). Within these four orders the\n\nmost notable effects in relative abundance was detected in Desulfobacterales. We detected a\n\nsignificant interactive effect between oil and reduced pH treatment in the relative abundance\n\nof Desulfobacterales (Wald Z test, z = -3.046, P = 0.002). Indeed, in line with the PCO analysis,\n\nthe most drastic effect was a decrease in the relative abundance of Desulfobacterales in\n\nmicrocosms with oil under reduced pH. In oil contaminated microcosms the relative\n\nabundance of Desulfobacterales decreased from 50.71\u00b16.96%, under normal water pH and\n\nwithout UV-B, to 19.56\u00b17.36%, in microcosms with reduced pH without UV-B. On the\n\nother hand, no significant effect of oil (Wald Z test, z = 1.386, P = 0.166), UV-B (Wald Z\n\ntest, z = -1.186, P = 0.235) or pH (Wald Z test, z = -1.408, P = 0.159) alone was detected,\n\nthus suggesting a synergistic interaction between oil and reduced water pH (Figure IV-2).\n\nSuch a drastic reduction in active Desulfobacterales members could have consequences\n\nfor the degradation of organic pollutants in contaminated marine sediments under reduced\n\nwater pH without UV-B. Desulfobacterales order includes diverse anaerobic sulphate-reducing\n\nbacteria. These bacteria are characterized by their ability to use sulphate as terminal electron\n\nacceptor in the oxidation of H2 and organic compounds. This directly links them to the\n\ncycling of carbon and sulphur and to the degradation of organic contaminants, including oil\n\nhydrocarbons, in a variety of habitats (Muyzer and Stams 2008, Zhou et al., 2011). The\n\nobserved decrease thus suggests that after oil contamination and under reduced pH the\n\ndegradation of organic contaminants can be substantially affected. Interestingly, although no\n\nsignificant differences were detected in hydrocarbon concentration between treatments with\n\noil, the highest values for several aliphatic (e.g. 1-decene and dodecene) and aromatic\n\nhydrocarbons (e.g. acenaphtylene, acenaphthene and fluorene) were detected in combined oil\n\nand reduced pH treatment (Figure S IV-1 and S IV-2). However, these values showed high\n\n\n\nOcean acidification and oil contamination have a synergistic effect on microbial composition\n\n113\n\nstandard deviation hampering the detection of significant differences in the amount of\n\nhydrocarbon removal between different groups.\n\nA significant interactive effect on the relative abundance of Desulfobacterales was also\n\ndetected between oil, UV-B and reduced pH treatment (Wald Z test, z = -3.046, P = 0.002).\n\nHowever, in this case, the relative abundance of Desulfobacterales was 29.70\u00b10.75, similar to\n\n31.83\u00b10.79 registered in oil contaminated sediments under normal pH with UV-B. Probably,\n\nin this case, oil hydrocarbon photochemical modification due to the presence of UV-B\n\nmasked the interaction between oil and pH detected without UV-B.\n\nFigure IV-2: Relative abundance of OTUs classified at order level under the independent and combined\neffects of reduced pH, UV-B exposure and oil contamination.

However,\n\ncontrary to what was observed in Desulfobacterales, the relative abundance of Methylococcales was\n\nthe highest in the microcosm with oil, UV-B and reduced pH. In oil contaminated\n\nmicrocosms, the relative abundance of this order increase from 9.81\u00b11.63%, under normal\n\npH and without UV-B, to 18.59\u00b13.54%, under reduced pH and in the presence of UV-B.\n\nFunctionally, order Methylococcales includes aerobic bacteria capable of oxidizing and utilizing\n\nmethane (methanotrophic) and other C1 compounds (methylotrophic) as source of carbon\n\nand energy (Bowman 2005). Methanotrophic bacteria respond rapidly to increase methane\n\nconcentrations, and it has been suggested that they may act as an important biofilter that\n\nlimits the release of CH4 from the ocean to the atmosphere (Kessler et al., 2011). This sudden\n\nincrease can be caused by the combined presence of UV-B and pH. The presence of UV-B\n\ncan induce the formation of C1 compounds through photochemical degradation of oil\n\nhydrocarbons whereas pH has been shown to exert a strong influence on other\n\nmethylotrophic bacteria, in ocean acidification mesocosms experiments (Roy et al., 2012).\n\nIndeed, an independent effect of pH (Wald Z test, z = 1.672, P = 0.094) and oil (Wald Z\n\ntest, z = -1.846, P = 0.064) was detected in order Methylococcales.\n\nPredicted metagenome analysis\n\nHere we used the PICRUSt software (http://picrust.github.com/picrust/) to predict\n\nmetagenome functional contents based on the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes\n\n(KEGG) classification to identify potential bacterial traits in our samples. Given the drastic\n\ndecrease in Desulfobacterales the focus was specifically set on the relative abundance of KEGG\n\northologs (KO) assigned to the category \u201cxenobiotics and degradation\u201d. The independent\n\nand interactive effect of oil, pH and UV-B on the relative abundance of the six most\n\nrepresentative pathways was analysed (Figure IV-3). The relative abundance of all KEGG\n\ncategories and of all xenobiotics and degradation pathways is available in supportive\n\ninformation Figures S IV-6 and S IV-7.

The major effect detected\n\nin our multifactorial experiment was a reduction of Desulfobacterales order due to a synergistic\n\ninteraction between oil contaminated sediments and reduced water pH. Considering the role\n\nthat sulphate-reducing bacteria have in anaerobic OH degradation, such a drastic reduction\n\ncan alter the detoxification capacity of marine sediment, increasing the toxicity of impacted\n\necosystems. Interestingly, probably due to photochemistry modifications of OH, a moderate\n\nlevel of UV-B appears to attenuate these effects. Therefore, it is likely that the magnitude of\n\nthese interactions and their effects will depend on the level of UV-B that penetrates the\n\nimpacted ecosystem. Oxidation of organic compounds coupled to the reduction of sulphate\n\nto sulfite may account for more than 50% of organic matter mineralization in the sea bed\n\n(Jorgensen 1982). Given that acidification will not be limited to surface waters and will also\n\noccur in the deep ocean (Orr et al., 2005) with low or absent ultraviolet radiation, the\n\ndegradation of OH in these environments can be considerably affected with widespread\n\nconsequences to higher trophic levels. Considering the implications of the observed effects\n\nto microbial communities we suggest that future studies focus on the mechanisms that\n\nunderlie the synergistic interactions between ocean acidification and oil contamination.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nThis work was supported by the Center for Environmental and Marine Studies\n\n(CESAM), the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia (FCT, Portugal) PTDC/AAC-\n\nCLI/107916/2008 (http://alfa.fct.mctes.pt) and the European Regional Development Fund\n\n(ERDF) through COMPETE-(FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-008657).

Approximately 5 g of homogenized and freeze-dried\n\nsediment were spiked with 25 \u00b5l (2 \u00b5g/ml) deuterated recovery surrogate standards (Supelco)\n\ncontaining naphthalene-d8, acenapthlene-d10, phenanthrene-d10, chrysene-d12 and perylene-d12\nand soxhlet extracted with 150 ml dicloromethane for 24 h (Yan et al., 2009). The extract was\n\nconcentrated by a rotator evaporator up to a volume of about 2-3 ml, and change solvent\n\ninto 10 ml n-hexane which further reduce to approximately 1-2 ml. A 2:1 alumina/silica gel\n\ncolumn with anhydrous sodium sulfate overlaying the alumina (remove small quantities of\n\nwater) was used to fractioned the extract. The first fraction, corresponding to aliphatic\n\nhydrocarbons, was eluted with 15 ml of n-hexane. The second fraction, containing PAH\n\ncompounds, were collected by eluting 30 ml of n-hexane/dichloromethane (1:1, v:v). The\n\ntwo fractions are combined for analysis. Sample extract was reduced to 1 ml and further to\n\n0.2 ml with a gentle purified nitrogen stream. A known quantity (2 mg/ml) of the internal\n\nstandard, hexamethylbenzene, was added prior to GC-MS. The determination of two\n\nhydrocarbons fraction was performed on a GC analyses were carried using an Agilent\n\nNetwork GC system, namely an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a mass\n\nselective detector (MSD 5973) with electron impact ionization (EI) operating at 70 eV\n\n(Agilent Technologies). A VF-5MS fused silica column (30 m x 0.25 mm i.d and 0.25 \u00b5m\n\nfilm thickness) was used for analytes separation. The GC\u2013MS conditions for sample analysis\n\nwere as follows: the injection was performed manual in the splitless mode, at transfer-line\n\nand injector temperature maintained at 300 \u00baC, and ion source at 230 \u00baC. Helium was used as\n\ncarrier gas at a flow of 1.3 ml min-1. Initial oven temperature was 60\u00baC, then ramped to 200\n\n\u00baC at 10 \u00baC min-1, followed by another ramp step to 300 \u00baC at a rate of 5\u00ba C min_1, and held\n\nfor 8 min. The electron impact ionization mode conditions were at ion energy 70 eV. The\n\nmass scanning ranged between m/? 20 and m/? 500.\n\nBefore sample analysis, a standard mixture and a procedural blank were run in\n\nsequence to check for contamination, peak identification and quantification.

Deutorated\n\nPAH surrogate standard were added to sediment samples to monitor the procedures of\n\nsample extraction, cleanup and analysis. The surrogate recoveries added to sediment samples\n\nwere 72 \u00b1 15% for naphthalene-d8 (n = 20), 73 \u00b1 15% for acenaphthene-d10 (n = 20), 89 \u00b1\n\n20% for phenanthrene-d10 (n = 20), 86 \u00b1 18% for chrysene-d12 (n = 20) and 86 \u00b1 18% for\n\nperylene-d10 (n = 20).\n\n\n\nOcean acidification and oil contamination have a synergistic effect on microbial composition\n\n123\n\nFigure S IV-1: Aliphatic hydrocarbon concentration in sediments from Cont - control with no treatment; OnOi -\ncontaminated with oil; UVOi - contaminated with oil and exposed to UV-B; pHOi - contaminated with oil and\nwater acidified; UVTot - contaminated with oil and exposed to UV-B and water acidified.

The CO2 addition was\n\ncontrolled with a feedback system that included a combination of pH electrode with a\n\ncontroller (V\u00b2 control pH controller, Tropical Marine Centre, UK) and a pressure regulator\n\nwith a integrated solenoid valve (V2 pressure regulator pro, Tropical Marine Centre, UK).\n\nThe controller allowed the visual representation of the actual pH. The acidified reservoir\n\nthank was monitored with a pH electrode and the controller opened the valve when the pH\n\nwas lower than the set value. CO2 was then delivered until return of the pH to the pre-set\n\nlevel. The acidified water was supplied to the microcosms in each high tide. In the\n\nstabilization period, the pH in the acidified reservoir thank was gradually decreased 0.19\n\nunits every two days, until a pH of 7.2. The microcosms were then stabilized for 10 more\n\ndays until the oil contamination.  The pH was monitored in the acidified and control\n\nmicrocosm with a calibrated pH meter (Orion Star portable meter, Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\nInc, USA) (Figure S IV-3) before each low tide. The average pH in the control microcosms\n\nwas 7.95 \u00b10.07 and in the acidified microcosms was 7.67\u00b10.07.\n\n\n\nOcean acidification and oil contamination have a synergistic effect on microbial composition\n\n126\n\nFigure S IV-3: Average pH variations in the different microcosms after the stabilization period.

The luminaire system incorporates dimming ballast that allows the\n\nadjustment of light intensity by varying the voltage supply. The ReefSET\u00ae proprietary\n\nsoftware enables the simulation of several scenarios by varying the percentage of light\n\nintensity (http://www.reefset.com). Because during summer months (JJA) the day length\n\nvaries between ~13 and ~15 h at Portuguese latitudes, a 14 h diurnal light cycle was\n\nsimulated with light intensity varying from 50% to 100% of the total fluorescent tube\n\nintensity (Table S IV-1). With the lamps set to 100% the photosynthetic active radiation\n\n(PAR: 400-700 nm) was 260.5\u00b156.3 ?mol photons m-2 s-1 (PAR spectrum - Figure S IV-1.A).\n\nPhotosynthetic Photon Flux Density (\u00b5mol photons m-2 s-1) was measured with a Quantum\n\nMeter with a separate sensor (Model MQ-200, Apogee Instruments, Logan, Utah, USA). The\n\nspectrum of photosynthetic active radiation was acquired using a USB2000\n\nspectroradiometer, with spectral resolution of 0.38 nm (USB2000-VISNIR, grating #3,\n\nOcean Optics, Duiven, Netherlands) and a 400 \u00b5m diameter optic fiber (QP400-2-\n\nVIS/NIR-BX, Ocean Optics).\n\nTwo UV-B conditions were implemented in the microcosm ensemble: microcosms\n\nirradiated with UV-B and microcosms were the UV-B was screened out. In the microcosms\n\nwith UV-B, a constant UV-B irradiance of 1426.36\u00b193.32 mW m-2, during 4 h per day\n\naround noontime, was used. This irradiance corresponds to 50% of the maximum intensity\n\nof the UV-B lamps (Table S IV-1). UV-B and UV-A spectra are represented in Figure S IV-\n\n1.C. The values of the UV-B irradiance and time exposure were chosen considering the\n\naction spectrum for generalized DNA-damage shown in Figure S IV-1.B, which was\n\nparametrized by Bernard and Seckmeyer (1997). To find the adequate values, we proceeded\n\nas follows: First, the effective DNA-damage UV intensity of the lamps was calculated\n\nmultiplying the spectrum of Figure S IV-1.C by the weighting function in 1.B and integrating\n\nover all spectral range. Next, the typical DNA-damage UV dose observed at Lisbon, in June,\n\nwas calculated using the observed DNA-damage UV doses available at the Web page of\n\nTEMIS (Tropospheric Emission Monitoring Internet Service at http://www.temis.nl/).\n\n\n\nOcean acidification and oil contamination have a synergistic effect on microbial composition\n\n128\n\nTEMIS is part of the Data User Programme (DUP) of the European Space Agency (ESA).\n\nFinally, the irradiation duration, in order to have the microcosms exposed to a DNA-damage\n\nUV dose similar to the observed one, was calculated dividing the typical DNA-damage UV\n\ndose, observed at Lisbon, by the effective DNA-damage UV intensity of the lamps.\n\nTo have microcosms without UV-B radiation and maintain UV-A radiation we used\n\na glass filter. The spectrum of the UV filtered radiation is also shown in Figure S IV-1.C.\n\nComparing Figures S IV-1.B and S IV-1.C, it may be seen that the glass filter removed\n\npractically all UV radiation with DNA-Damage effect, allowing comparable irradiances at the\n\nlonger wavelengths of the UV-A, except for the line centered at 365 nm. All the treatments\n\nreceived a similar amount of integrated UV-A irradiance of 2875.91\u00b1264.62 mW m-2. UV-A\n\nand UV-B irradiances were accessed with a spectro-radiometer, place at the minimum tide\n\nlevel (35 cm from the lamps), connected to a monochromator that provides information on\n\nthe spectral irradiance with a resolution of one nanometer. Spectral irradiance was obtained\n\nby the BenWin+ Software (Bentham Instruments, Reading, UK) (Ribeiro et al., 2011).\n\nPhotosynthetic Photon Flux Density, PAR and UV spectra were measured under each\n\nluminaire in minimum tide high in the middle and border microcosms.\n\n\n\nOcean acidification and oil contamination have a synergistic effect on microbial composition\n\n129\n\nFigure S IV-4: Experimental light spectra.

The SML was initially chosen as a\n\nmodel environment due to: a) the enrichment of a wide range of pollutants, including OH,\n\nthat can be found in this particular compartment of the water column (Wurl et al., 2004); and\n\nb) the lack of existing studies that specifically focused on the SML hydrocarbonoclastic\n\nbacterial communities. The mesotidal costal lagoon Ria de Aveiro was chosen to perform this\n\nstudy since due to an intense commercial shipping activity it is subject to a continuous efflux\n\nof OH, making it suitable to study the responses of bacterioneuston community structure to\n\nOH. The collecting points were selected in order to reflect a gradient of oil pollution,\n\nextending from the outer section of the estuary to the inner section of canal de \u00cdlhavo.\n\nHowever, this selection is not absent of criticism since the collecting points are also subject to\n\nother sources of organic contamination rather than oil, making difficult to access the\n\nindependent effect of OH pollution.\n\nThe difficulty in isolating experimental variables and establishing cause-effect\n\nrelationships in field studies is a problem not only in microbial ecology studies but also in\n\necology in general (Jessup et al., 2004, Benton et al., 2007). This justified the development of an\n\nexperimental life support system that allows high control microcosm experiments designed to\n\nstudy the interactions of bacterial communities and OH under climate change scenarios. The\n\nadvantages and disadvantages of using small-scale experiments and the development of the\n\nmicrocosm framework are described in chapters I and III, respectively. The logical step after\n\nthe exploratory study on the hydrocarbonoclastic bacterioneuston community would have\n\nbeen to test several climate change scenarios in the SML. However, simulating the formation\n\nof a stable bacterioneuston community in the ELSS with a minimum of realism appeared as a\n\ncomplex task. Even under environmental conditions, the establishment and structure of a\n\ncomplex SML bacterial community is still a poorly understood phenomenon (Cunliffe et al.,\n\n2011) that can be affected by several factors such as strong water currents (Santos et al., 2011).\n\n\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n\n142\n\nNonetheless, the simulation of the SML with this system is possible in principle, although\n\nadditional system optimization efforts would be required. Therefore, the experimental design\n\nfocused on the microbial community of sediments retrieve from the shallow coastal lagoon\n\nRia de Aveiro.\n\nShallow estuarine areas provide crucial ecosystem functions. However, the\n\nconsequences of climate changes and anthropogenic contaminants, such as OH, in these areas\n\nremain largely unknown. Since key ecosystem functions in shallow-water sediments are mainly\n\ncontrolled by microorganisms, it is important to understand the effects of these multiple\n\nstressors on these communities (Alsterberg et al., 2011).\n\nConsiderations on climate change and oil spill microcosms experiment\n\nSome important guidelines were followed when programming the experiment: a) the\n\nexperiment should simulate global change scenarios within the limits established by available\n\nmodels; b) the sediment should be stabilized in the microcosms before the oil introduction; c)\n\nthe experiment should operate during a reasonable time; d) the microcosms should simulate a\n\nshallow environment; e) sediment should be collected intact in the field, in order to preserve\n\nits aerobic (~1 cm of top sediment) and anaerobic layers (~10 cm of top sediment); f)\n\nsediment sampling within the microcosm should be keep to minimum to avoid microcosm\n\nperturbation during the experiment. The acidification of the synthetic water was accomplished\n\nby bubbling CO2 into the water. This method is described as an efficient way of manipulating\n\ncarbonate chemistry in seawater (Gattuso et al., 2009). The lowest average pH was 7.65\u00b10.67\n\nin the acidified microcosms and 7.97\u00b10.07 in the control microcosms, representing a pH\n\ndecrease of approximately 0.3. This value falls within 0.3-0.4 pH reduction modeled for the\n\nocean surface by the end of this century (Caldeira et al., 2003).\n\nTwo limitations of UV-B simulation were taken into consideration. First, the spectral\n\nirradiance emitted by UV lamps does not match the solar irradiance. UV lamps emit more\n\nshort-wave and less long-wave UV-B than the sun (Xu et al., 2010). Since the biological and\n\nchemical effects of UVR are wavelength dependent (Rundel, 1983, Santos et al., 2013) a\n\ndescription of wavelength dependency is necessary to simulate increasing UVR scenarios with\n\nsome degree of realism. Thus, a biological spectral weighting function that describes the\n\neffectiveness of the lamp wavelength to produce biological responses is needed to calculate\n\nthe effective biological UV-B (Andreasson et al., 2006). Second, unlike the effect of increasing\n\n\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n\n143\n\natmospheric CO2 on ocean pH, there is no available information on how the amount of\n\nultraviolet radiation that reaches the water surface will vary in the next century. Although\n\ninteractions between climate change and stratospheric ozone have the potential to impact\n\nfuture levels of ambient UVR (Thomas et al., 2012, UNEP, 2012, UNEP, 2010), developing\n\nmodels that simulate and can predict future UVR levels requires a broad range of inputs,\n\nmaking this a complex task (Thomas et al., 2012).\n\nIn order to address the first limitation, the values of the UV-B irradiance and time of\n\nexposure where considered using the action spectrum for generalized DNA-damage\n\nparameterized by Bernard and Seckmeyer (1997). In the absence of available models of future\n\nUV-B, it was chosen to implement two conditions in the system: microcosms irradiated with\n\nUV-B and microcosms where the UV-B was screened out. The typical DNA-damage UV dose\n\nobserved at Lisbon, in June, was implemented in microcosms irradiated with UV-B. A similar\n\namount of UV-A integrated irradiance was also supplemented to all microcosms (including\n\nnon UV-B treated) since UV-A radiation is practically unaffected by changes in ozone\n\ndepletion and plays an important role in photo-repair mechanisms (Bargagli, 2005). Complete\n\ndescription of the system and procedures can be found in chapters III and IV.\n\nThe experimental life support system operated during 21 days before the addition of\n\noil in order to allow microbial communities to stabilize under microcosm conditions. During\n\nthis period, microcosms were gradually acidified until they reached the target pH. The\n\nmicrocosms were kept at the experimental irradiance from day 1. After the oil spill the system\n\noperated during 36 days more, in a total of 57 days. The duration of the experiment was\n\nestablished taking into consideration the previous knowledge on microbial dynamics when\n\nexposed to oil contamination and the necessary logistics to maintain the experiment. It is well\n\nestablished that microbial community structure can change significantly when exposed to oil\n\nhydrocarbon, favoring groups that can use oil hydrocarbons as carbon and energy source\n\n(Gomes et al., 2005, Yakimov et al., 2005). Therefore, possible interactive effects of oil, UVR\n\nand ocean acidification on microbial community structure could be masked by initial changes\n\ndue to oil exposure. It is plausible to speculate that potential interactions would only emerge\n\nafter an initial period. On the other hand, although the ELSS can be set to function by only\n\ntwo operators working in shifts, its functioning requires considerable amounts of water and\n\nsynthetic salt. The ELSS consumed approximately 96 l of water and 3.3 kg of salt per day of\n\noperation. Thus a compromise between these two important factors had to be made and the\n\nsystem operated during 57 days.\n\n\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n\n144\n\nWater renewal between tides at the original site from where the sediment was collected\n\nis almost 100%. However, since one of the experiment guidelines was to simulate a shallow\n\nenvironment, the microcosms were programmed to simulate a 50% water renewal between\n\ntides, similar to that estimated for the central area of the estuary (Dias et al., 2001). Therefore,\n\nthe sediments in the microcosms were exposed to more anoxic conditions than in their natural\n\nenvironment. These conditions introduced a changing in the original microbial community,\n\nfavoring anaerobic groups. The relative abundance of Desulfobacterales which mainly includes\n\nanaerobic bacteria, clearly increased under microcosm conditions. This was not the only\n\nchange in the microbial community. Although the dominant groups present in the\n\nenvironment were also detected in the microcosms, the microcosm conditions caused a\n\ndecrease in rare groups. It can be argued that the microcosms failed to fully reproduce the\n\noriginal community detected in the environment. However, the goal of the experiment was\n\nnot to reproduce with detail the original communities but rather to sustain a microbial\n\ncommunity that preserved some of their original structural and functional characteristics.\n\nImportantly, water inorganic analysis and stress indicators of the model organisms Hediste\n\ndiversicolor suggested that the changes in the microbial community structure did not affect the\n\nmicrocosm artificial ecosystem.\n\nMicrobial communities and oil hydrocarbon degradation in estuarine environments \u2013\nmain conclusions and unanswered questions\n\nIn this study, Pseudomonas emerged as a representative genus within the hydrocarbon\n\ndegrading bacteria in the SML. The ability of Pseudomonads to degrade OH and their role in\n\nbioengineered remediation strategies is not new (Menn et al., 2008). However, this was the first\n\ntime that hydrocarbon-degrading isolates were obtained from the SML. As referred, the SML\n\nis the first water compartment to be in contact with OH pollutants after major oil spills.\n\nTherefore, Pseudomonas isolates adapted to this layer can be ideal targets for engineer or\n\npromote (through biostimulation strategies) during oil spills. Two important aspects arise\n\nfrom this work. The first refers to the pattern of variation along the oil gradient observed in\n\nPseudomonas DGGE profile. Due to the role of Pseudomonas in organic matter degradation these\n\npatterns can imply a potential functional change that should be explored in future studies. A\n\nmetatranscriptomic approach could be used to characterize the expression of genes related to\n\norganic matter and OH degradation in this layer. The second aspect is the evidence of\n\n\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n\n145\n\nhorizontal gene transference between different bacterial isolates. Horizontal gene transfer is a\n\nrapid mechanism that microorganisms use to share OH degrading genes when facing a sudden\n\ninput of OH (American Academy of Microbiology, 2011). Future work should focus on this\n\nprocess that can be determinant in the capacity of bacterial communities to degrade oil in\n\ncontaminated environments.\n\nThe microcosm experiment demonstrated that the impact of an oil spill in the active\n\nbacterial communities capable of degrading oil will be substantially different in future ocean\n\npH levels. Desulfobacterales order relative abundance decreased drastically after the oil spill\n\nsimulation under reduced ocean pH when compared to normal pH. Moreover, a significant\n\nchange in predicted genes associated with several OH degradation pathways was also detected,\n\nconfirming that the observed changes in Desulfobacterales will probably have functional\n\nconsequences in OH degradation. Anaerobic degradation of oil hydrocarbons by\n\nmicroorganisms in marine sediments reduces toxic hydrocarbons (Rothermich et al., 2002).\n\nTherefore, a drastic reduction in Desulfobacterales could significantly change the capacity of\n\ncoastal and estuarine systems to degrade OH with widespread consequences in higher trophic\n\nlevels. Importantly, the pH reduction simulated in this study is probably the best-case scenario\n\nfor coastal and estuarine environments. Increased eutrophication in these areas will exacerbate\n\nthe effect of ocean acidification due to the development of hypoxic and anoxic zones\n\n(Howarth et al., 2011). Interestingly, a moderate level of UV-B appears to attenuate these\n\neffects probably because of photochemistry modifications of OH. Therefore, it is likely that\n\nthe magnitude of these interactions and their effects will depend on the level of UV-B that\n\npenetrates the impacted ecosystem. Future work must be done to unravel the mechanisms\n\nthat underlie the associated changes to clarify the drastic decrease of Desulfobacterales and the\n\ntoxicity of oil degradation products under these conditions. Other observed shifts in the\n\nstructure of microbial communities should also be the focus of future research. A significant\n\nincrease of Methylococcales in oil contaminated sediment under reduced pH and UV-B was also\n\nregistered. Methanotrophic bacteria may act as an important biofilter that limits the release of\n\nCH4 to the atmosphere, and therefore the ecological relevance of the observed trends should\n\nalso be accessed in future studies.\n\n\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n\n146\n\nLiterature cited\n\nAlsterberg C, Hulth S, Sundb\u00e4ck K (2011)\n\nResponse of a shallow-water sediment system to\n\nwarming.

Gomes*\n\nEcology and Evolution\n\nAbstract: Global climate change has the potential to seriously and adversely affect marine ecosystem\nfunctioning. Numerous experimental and modelling studies have demonstrated how predicted ocean acidification\n\nand increased ultraviolet radiation (UVR) can affect marine microbes. However, researchers have largely ignored\n\ninteractions between ocean acidification, increased ultraviolet radiation and anthropogenic pollutants in marine\n\nenvironments. Such interactions can alter chemical speciation and the bioavailability of several organic and\n\ninorganic pollutants with potentially deleterious effects, such as modifying microbial mediated detoxification\n\nprocesses. Microbes mediate major biogeochemical cycles, providing fundamental ecosystems services such as\n\nenvironmental detoxification and recovery. It is, therefore, important to understand how predicted changes to\n\noceanic pH, UVR and temperature will affect microbial pollutant detoxification processes in marine ecosystems.\n\nThe intrinsic characteristics of microbes, such as their short generation time, small size and functional role in\n\nbiogeochemical cycles combined with recent advances in molecular techniques (e.g., metagenomics and\n\nmetatranscriptomics) make microbes excellent models to evaluate the consequences of various climate change\n\nscenarios on detoxification processes in marine ecosystems. In this review, we highlight the importance of\n\nmicrobial microcosm experiments, coupled with high-resolution molecular biology techniques, to provide a\n\ncritical experimental framework to start understanding how climate change, anthropogenic pollution and\n\nmicrobiological interactions may affect marine ecosystems in the future.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAnthropogenic concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) have increased from\n\napproximately 280 ppm (parts per million) in preindustrial times (Inderm\u00fchle et al., 1999) to\n\nnearly 394 ppm in 2012 (NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory, 2012). Levels of CO2 in\n\nthe atmosphere now exceed limits considered natural for most animals and plants (Ehleringer\n\net al., 2002). The best known postulated consequence of an increasing atmospheric CO2\nconcentration is global warming, which may, among other things, lead to sea level changes,\n\npromote ocean stratification, and alter the sea-ice extent and patterns of ocean circulation\n\n(Doney et al., 2012). In addition to the above, increased atmospheric CO2 will also lead to a\n\nnet air-to-sea flux of CO2, thereby reducing seawater pH and modifying the chemical balance\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\n152\n\namong inorganic carbon species. This process, known as ocean acidification, is often referred\n\nto as \u201cthe other CO2 problem\u201d (Henderson, 2006). In contrast to other climate change\n\nscenarios, ocean acidification is a direct consequence of increased atmospheric CO2 and does\n\nnot depend on uncertainties related to other climate change predictions (Doney et al., 2009).\n\nAlthough international treaties have been effective in reducing atmospheric\n\nconcentrations of ozone depleting substances, increased greenhouse gas concentrations have\n\nthe potential to affect the spatial distribution of ozone and its exchange between the\n\nstratosphere and the troposphere; this, in turn, will influence ultraviolet radiation (UVR) levels\n\nreaching the Earth\u2019s surface (UNEP, 2010, UNEP, 2012). Higher UVR levels have also been\n\nshown to disrupt aquatic food webs and reduce the biological sinking capacity of aquatic\n\nenvironments for atmospheric CO2 (Hader et al., 2007, Fabry et al., 2008).\n\nIn addition to the effects of anthropogenic activities on global climate change, fossil\n\nfuel combustion, fertilizer use, and industrial activity have adversely affected coastal and open-\n\nocean environments for decades, providing a continuous influx of pollutants [including oil\n\nhydrocarbons (OH), pesticides and heavy metals] into these ecosystems (Doney, 2010). With\n\nrespect to OH, natural seepage alone introduces about 6\u00d7105 metric tons year-1 of crude-oil to\n\noceans, representing c. 47% of crude oil entering the marine environment. The remaining\n\n53%, results from anthropogenic activities (accidental oil spills, transport activities, refining,\n\nstorage, and others) (Kvenvolden et al., 2003). Among scientists, there is a growing awareness\n\nthat ocean acidification and increased UVR have the potential to alter contaminant transfer in\n\naquatic food webs, and modify the structure of aquatic trophic webs and that the\n\nbiomagnification of contaminants may lead to increased toxicity in marine ecosystems\n\n(Pelletier et al., 2006, Fabry et al., 2008).\n\nMicrobial communities play a central role in the global recycling of pollutants. For\n\nexample, the oil-catabolic versatility of microbes, particularly bacteria, ensures that oceans are\n\nnot completely covered with an oil film (Head et al., 2006). Despite the importance of\n\nmicrobes in the process of global recycling of anthropogenic pollutants, the potential\n\ninteractions of ocean acidification, UVR, anthropogenic pollutants and marine microbial\n\ncommunities have been largely ignored. Little is known about how ocean acidification and\n\nincreased UVR can interact with anthropogenic pollutants will affect microbial communities\n\nand biogeochemical cycling.\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\n153\n\nMoreover, although ocean acidification and increased UVR have the potential to affect\n\nmicrobial assemblages (Riebesell et al., 2007, Santos et al., 2012b, Liu et al., 2010), very little is\n\nknown about the effects on microbial mediated pollutant detoxification and how this will\n\nimpact pollutant pathways (Figure A-1).\n\nThe aim of this review is to present the recent advances in our understanding of the\n\nconsequences of interactions between ocean acidification, increased UVR, anthropogenic\n\npollutants and marine microbial communities. Recent technological advances in molecular\n\nmicrobiology as a means to improving our ability to study potential interactive effects are also\n\ndiscussed.\n\nOcean acidification and UVR interactions with marine microbial communities \u2013 what\nwe know so far\n\nIf CO2 emissions continue unabated, oceanic pH will decline 0.3 to 0.4 units by the\n\nend of this century, and up to 0.7 units in 2300 (Caldeira et al., 2003). When CO2 dissolves in\n\nseawater, carbonic acid (H2CO3) is formed and quickly dissociates into hydrogen (H\n+) and\n\nFigure A-1: Interactions between ultraviolet radiation, ocean acidification, anthropogenic pollution and microbial\ncommunities. Climate change has the potential to influence pollutant toxicity by acting directly on pollutant\n\nchemistry or indirectly by affecting microbial mediated detoxification.\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\n154\n\nbicarbonate (HCO3\n-) ions. A hydrogen ion can then react with a carbonate ion (CO3\n\n-2) to form\n\nbicarbonate. This process leads to increased partial pressure (pCO2), increased concentrations\n\nof H2CO3, HCO\n-\n3, and H\n\n+, and reduced concentrations of CO3\n-2 (Fabry et al., 2008). These\n\nchanges in carbonate chemistry have serious implications for marine organisms that depend\n\non minerals such as calcite and aragonite to produce shells and skeletons (e.g., corals, mollusks,\n\nechinoderms and crustaceans). Indeed, the available data suggests that calcification rates will\n\nbe affected under future pCO2 scenarios (Fabry et al., 2008).\n\nA key question is how microbial communities and microbial mediated biogeochemical\n\nprocesses will be affected by ocean acidification. Joint et al. (2011) recently argued that given\n\nthat microbial assemblages have always experienced variable pH conditions, the appropriate\n\nnull hypothesis to be tested is that \u201cthere will be no catastrophic changes in marine\n\nbiogeochemical processes driven by phytoplankton, bacteria and archaea\u201d. In response to this\n\narticle, Liu et al. (2010), performed a meta-analysis of published data and suggested that\n\nchanges in microbial structure and function are possible. Both authors provide valid\n\narguments to a complex issue that we have only just started to understand. So far, existing\n\nstudies suggest that microbial mediated processes such as carbon and nitrogen cycles may be\n\naffected. For example, Riebesell et al. (2007) showed that a phytoplankton community\n\nresponded to higher CO2 concentrations (three times the present pCO2 conditions) in\n\nseawater by an up to 39% increase in net primary production. Increased pCO2 may also impact\n\nthe nitrogen cycle. The filamentous cyanobacterium Trichodesmium, a major contributor of new\n\nnitrogen in oligotrophic oceans, has been shown to increase carbon and nitrogen fixation rates\n\nby 35 to 100% at pCO2 levels predicted for 2100 (Hutchins et al., 2007). In addition to\n\nnitrogen fixation, other components of the nitrogen cycle may also be altered by ocean\n\nacidification. Nitrification can be affected by pH driven changes in the availability of ammonia\n\n(NH3). Beman et al. (2010) suggest that a reduction in nitrification rates of 3-44% can occur\n\nwithin a few decades. With respect to bacterial communities there is little information and the\n\nexisting studies are less clear. Most of the studies regarding bacteria under ocean acidification\n\nscenarios have been performed in large pelagic mesocosm systems that study the effect of\n\ncarbonate chemistry modifications through the food web. These experiments are capable of\n\nrealistic simulations where indirect effects from interactions with phytoplankton can be\n\nstudied. Experiments such as these have demonstrated that bacterial abundance and activity\n\ncan vary due to phytoplankton shifts under high pCO2 (Grossart et al., 2003, Allgaier et al.,\n\n2008). Regarding community structure, large mesocosms and small-scale approaches have\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\n155\n\nrevealed contrasting effects. In large pelagic mesocosms dominant bacterial community shifts\n\nwere not related to pCO2 (Roy et al., 2012), whereas in small microcosm systems, pH levels\n\npredicted for the year 2100 had a significant impact on bacterial structure (Krause et al., 2012).\n\nIt is clear that we still have much to learn about microbial dynamics under elevated\n\npCO2 levels, particularly with respect to the underlying mechanisms that trigger some of the\n\nobserved trends. Furthermore, the impact of ocean acidification on microbial function needs\n\nto be addressed with more focus on local or regional conditions, since the magnitude of\n\ncarbonate changes will vary across regions. For example, anthropogenic stressors exacerbate\n\nocean acidification through the development of hypoxic and anoxic zones due to increased\n\neutrophication in coastal and estuarine areas. Low oxygen waters are more acidic than ocean\n\nwaters. In a model saline estuary the development of hypoxia is enough to reduce pH levels by\n\nmore than 0.5 units (Howarth et al., 2011).\n\nEffects of UVR in marine microbial communities\n\nResearchers have studied the effects of UVR for some decades. An important impetus\n\nfor studying UVR was the concern for the ozone layer, which had been adversely affected by\n\nchlorofluorocarbons. Following implementation of the Montreal protocol that placed\n\nrestrictions on ozone-depleting substances, ozone levels in the atmosphere are no longer\n\ndeclining (McKenzie et al., 2011). However, recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer to 1980\u2019s\n\nlevels is not likely to occur in the next decades (Weatherhead et al., 2006). In fact, the area of\n\nthe Antarctica ozone hole reached a maximum in 2006 (Nasa, 2009) and in 2011 a record\n\ndestruction of the ozone layer over the Arctic was reported (Manney et al., 2011). Therefore,\n\nchanges in UV radiation levels in the future will depend on changes in various atmospheric\n\nfactors, besides total ozone, including clouds, aerosols, as well as surface reflectivity (or\n\nalbedo), in some locations. Other factors, including tropospheric gaseous pollutants and\n\nstratospheric temperature, may also play a role (WMO, 2010). Due to the complexity of\n\nfactors influencing changes in UV radiation levels reaching the Earth\u2019s surface, future trends\n\nin UV radiation levels are uncertain and contrasting predictions exist. For example, while\n\nsome prediction models indicate that by the 2090\u2019s mean erythemal UV levels will drop by up\n\nto 12% worldwide compared to values recorded in 1980 (Bais et al., 2011), other models\n\nindicate that UV-B levels will increased in the Northern Hemisphere in response to reductions\n\nin the amount of aerosols and clouds (Hegglin et al., 2009, Watanabe et al., 2011).\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\n156\n\nIt is well known that the amount of UVR that reaches the earth\u2019s surface has\n\nimportant consequences for aquatic ecosystems. UVR is the most photochemically reactive\n\nwaveband of incident solar radiation and can have genotoxic, cytotoxic and ontogenetic\n\neffects on aquatic organisms (Bancroft et al., 2007). It is commonly divided into three\n\nwavelength ranges: UV-A (320-400 nm), UV-B (290-320 nm), and UV-C (<290 nm). DNA\nabsorbs only weakly at longer UV wavelengths (Jones et al., 1987). Thus, the biological effects\n\nof UV-A are usually considered to be indirect, resulting from intracellular generation of\n\nreactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative damage to lipids, proteins and DNA (Pattison et al.,\n\n2006). UV-C wavelengths are generally not deemed to be environmentally relevant, given that\n\nthey are almost completely screened out of the atmosphere by oxygen and ozone. UV-B is the\n\nhighest energy wavelength of solar radiation that reaches the Earth\u2019s surface and the UV\n\nwavelength mostly affected by shifts in the ozone layer (Andersen et al., 2002). UV-B radiation\n\ncan cause damage to nearly all biomolecules by direct absorption or indirectly as a result of\n\nenhanced formation of ROS (Vincent et al., 2000).\n\nEnvironmental effects of UVR radiation are generally attenuated by protective\n\nstrategies displayed by living organisms, such as avoidance, photochemical quenching and\n\nrepair. The overall stress imposed by UVR exposure thus reflects a balance between damage,\n\nrepair and the energetic costs of protection, while it may also affect energy consumption and\n\nthe biochemical composition of cellular material, resulting in lower survival and growth rates\n\n(Vincent et al., 2000). UVR represents an important stressor for bacteria in aquatic ecosystems,\n\nas their simple haploid genomes provide little or no functional redundancy (Garcia-Pichel,\n\n1994). In general, exposure to UV-B reduces extracellular enzymatic activities (Herndl et al.,\n\n1993, Santos et al., 2012), oxygen consumption (Joux et al., 2009) and leucine and thymidine\n\nincorporation (Sommaruga et al., 1997, Santos et al., 2012). Different bacterial groups have also\n\nbeen shown to vary in their sensitivity to UVR and the potential to repair UVR induced\n\ndamage (Fern\u00e1ndez Zenoff et al., 2006, Santos et al., 2012). Gammaproteobacteria have been\n\nidentified as the most UV-resistant group in several aquatic environments (Santos et al., 2012,\n\nAlonso-S\u00e1ez et al., 2006, Ordo\u00f1ez et al., 2009). Field studies have also identified the Bacteroidetes\n\ngroup as UV resistant (Alonso-S\u00e1ez et al., 2006, Fern\u00e1ndez Zenoff et al., 2006). The\n\nAlphaproteobacteria group, on the other hand, has been reported to be UV-sensitive (Alonso-\n\nS\u00e1ez et al., 2006). Among Alphaproteobacteria, the SAR11 cluster, which is potentially the most\n\nabundant and ubiquitous clade of heterotrophic marine bacteria in the oceans (Morris et al.,\n\n2002a) were found to be particularly sensitive to solar UVR (Alonso-S\u00e1ez et al., 2006, Ruiz-\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\n157\n\nGonz\u00e1lez et al., 2012). High UVR sensitivity of SAR11 was attributed to the high A+T content\n\n(69%) reported for the genome of the representative member of this group, Pelagibacter ubique\n\n(Giovannoni et al., 2005b). The UV sensitivity of the SAR11 group is also supported by recent\n\nobservations of the disappearance of sequences affiliated to Pelagibacter in natural Patagonian\n\nbacterioplankton communities following an 8-day exposure to PAR, PAR+UV-A and\n\nPAR+UV-A+UV-B (Manrique et al., 2012). Other studies, however, indicate stimulation of\n\nSAR11 activity by light, potentially associated with the presence of proteorhodopsins\n\n(Giovannoni et al., 2005a, Lami et al., 2009, Mary et al., 2008). Further studies are necessary to\n\nelucidate how environmental factors, particularly UVR, affect SAR11 diversity and activity.\n\nThe differential sensitivity to UVR exhibited by the most abundant bacterial groups\n\npresent in the bacterioplankton is of paramount importance for the biogeochemical impact of\n\nenhanced UVR on ecosystems. The rationale for this assumption is the contrasting activity\n\ndisplayed by different groups of bacteria on the utilization of DOM (Cottrell et al., 2000). For\n\nexample, UVR-sensitive Alphaproteobacteria populations seem to be responsible for a large part\n\nof low-molecular-weight DOM uptake, while the more UVR-resistant Bacteroidetes, tend\n\nspecialize in high-molecular-weight DOM uptake (Cottrell et al., 2000, Alonso-S\u00e1ez et al.,\n\n2006). Therefore, changes in bacterial community structure triggered by increased UV-B levels\n\nmay promote dramatic shifts in DOM pathways (Morris et al., 2002b).\n\nSynergistic effect of UVR, ocean acidification and anthropogenic pollutants\n\nWill interactions between UVR, ocean acidification and anthropogenic pollutants affect marine microbes?\n\nDespite the fact that several studies have shown that environmental, physical, and\n\nchemical parameters directly affect the toxicity of anthropogenic pollutants, the interactive\n\neffects of UVR and ocean acidification on the chemistry of these pollutants and their effects\n\non marine microbial communities have received very little attention. Increased UVR levels and\n\nchanges to ocean pH will certainly affect the chemistry of several natural compounds and\n\nenvironmental pollutants, thus altering the way that they will interact with marine organisms.\n\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), one of the most common compounds associated to\n\nOH pollution, are ideal examples of photoactive contaminants that are strongly absorbed in\n\nthe UV-A and UV-B spectral regions. It is known that PAH toxicity to marine organisms may\n\nincrease with exposure to UVR. This increase is largely regulated by two processes: namely,\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\n158\n\nphotosensitization and photooxidation reactions. Both of these processes have the potential\n\nto release phototoxic aromatic hydrocarbons into the environment, which are more toxic than\n\ntheir parent compounds (Krylov et al., 1997).\n\nReduced oceanic pH has the potential to affect the adsorption of metals by organic\n\nparticles. Generally, organic particles are negatively charged and, as pH declines, surface sites\n\nbecome less available to adsorb positive ions like metals (Millero et al., 2009). This aspect is\n\nparticularly important due to the fact that more than 99% of the total concentration of most\n\nmetals in seawater corresponds to organic complexes (Millero et al., 2009). Small deviations in\n\nthe concentration of elements such as Cu and Cd can have a serious effect on the health of\n\nmarine organisms (Millero et al., 2009). Organic materials though are often nonhomogeneous\n\nand of unknown structure. It is essential that we gain a better understanding of metal\n\nspeciation in organic complexes (Millero et al., 2009, Doney et al., 2009).\n\nA key question is whether there is any evidence of an interaction between UVR and\n\nocean acidification, on one hand and anthropogenic pollutants on the other. The answer is\n\nyes, although several details are missing and require further research. Photoenhanced toxicity\n\nof PAH due to UVR exposure has already been observed in a variety of organisms. On crab\n\nlarvae no significant effect of PAH and UVR exposure was detected on larval crab mortality\n\nafter independent exposure but the combined effect of both, resulted in up to 100% mortality,\n\n(Peachey, 2005). This phenomenon has also been verified in isolated bacterial strains\n\n(McConkey et al., 1997), although only a few studies have addressed the effect of UVR photo-\n\nmodified pollutants in complex microbial assemblages (Pelletier et al., 2006, Petersen et al.,\n\n2008). In a microcosm experiment designed to study the effects of increased UV-B in the\n\npresence of the water soluble fraction of crude oil, an increase in mortality was observed in\n\nthe phytoplankton community exposed to UV-B. In this scenario, the toxic effects on\n\nphytoplankton led to a release of carbon and other nutrients that stimulated bacterial growth\n\n(Pelletier et al., 2006). A similar effect was reported in sediment microcosms (Petersen et al.,\n\nwhere algal 14C-incorporation and chlorophyll a content both declined in sediments exposed\n\nto UV-light and pyrene. At the same time, oxygen consumption and the release of N and P\n\nincreased, suggesting an increase in bacterial activity (Petersen et al., 2008).\n\nIt has been suggested that altered water CO2 chemistry in combination with other\n\nenvironmental stressors may modify the responses of organisms, and even ecosystems, to\n\nthese stressors in ways that differ substantially from the action of only a single stressor (Fabry\n\net al. 2008). Indeed, ocean acidification in combination with elevated nutrient inputs can\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\n159\n\naccelerate the expansion of filamentous turfs at the expense of calcifying algae in a synergistic\n\nresponse 34% greater than the sum of their individual effects (Russell et al., 2009). Recently, it\n\nwas reported that DNA damage in amphipods was 2.7 times higher in metal contaminated\n\nsediment under an increase pCO2 (750 ?atm) scenario (Roberts et al., 2012). However, nothing\n\nis known about possible changes in the response of marine microbes to anthropogenic\n\npollutants under increased pCO2 scenarios.\n\nGenerally, very little is known about the potential interactions (antagonistic, additive,\n\nor synergistic) between different pollutants. Although it lies outside the scope of this review,\n\nthis topic is important given that marine ecosystems are exposed to a myriad of novel\n\nchemical substances that can react in unexpected ways (Crain et al., 2008).\n\nMicrobial mediated detoxification\n\nAn important question to be addressed is whether the effects of ocean acidification\n\nand UVR will affect microbial communities in such a way that it may alter microbial mediated\n\ndetoxification of anthropogenic pollutants. In addition to directly measurable physiological\n\neffects on marine microbes, UVR and ocean acidification can also indirectly affect the toxicity\n\nof anthropogenic pollutants by inducing shifts in microbial community structure; they can also\n\nalter microbial mediated detoxification processes. For example, the bioavailability of inorganic\n\nnutrients required for bacterial growth, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, is a key factor in\n\nsuccessful ecosystem detoxification of PAH (Atlas et al., 1972). Anything that alters the\n\nnitrogen cycle, such as ocean acidification has the potential to alter microbial mediated PAH\n\ndetoxification processes and consequently PAH toxicity.\n\nA critical potential effect of ocean acidification is an alteration of metal bioavailability.\n\nMetals interact with microbes in various ways, and are involved in virtually all aspects of\n\nmicrobial growth and metabolism (Gadd, 2010). Changes in iron chemistry are particularly\n\nimportant, given that iron is a limiting nutrient for marine phytoplankton in large oceanic\n\nregions (Sunda et al., 2010). The pCO2 values predicted for the year 2100 would reduce iron\n\nuptake by diatoms and coccolithophores by 10 to 20% (Shi et al., 2010). The reduction in iron\n\navailability is believed to be related to pH induced binding of iron to organic ligands, thus\n\nreducing biologically available Fe(III) (Shi et al., 2010; Sunda, 2010). The net effect of ocean\n\nacidification on iron chemistry is still unclear. For example, although lower pH also increases\n\niron binding to organic ligands, the solubility of Fe(III) increases with water acidification in\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\n160\n\nsurface ocean waters (Figure A-2) (Millero et al., 2009). Changes in iron bioavailability due to\n\nocean acidification have, therefore, potentially harmful effects (Shi et al., 2010). Iron is also an\n\nimportant factor in the detoxification of hydrocarbons, by influencing the activity of enzymes\n\nthat catalyze the oxidative breakdown of PAH (Dinkla et al., 2001, Santos et al., 2008).\n\nMonooxygenase and dioxygenase enzymes, essential in most microbial PAH degradation\n\npathways, require a metal cofactor which is often iron (Bugg, 2003). The activity of several key\n\nenzymes, including toluene monooxygenase, in the degradation of the aromatic hydrocarbon\n\ntoluene by Pseudomonas putida, was found to be reduced under iron limiting conditions (Dinkla\n\net al., 2001). The complexity of biological, chemical and environmental interactions in natural\n\nenvironments restricts our ability to establish cause-effect relationships. Understanding the\n\ninteractive effects of climate change and anthropogenic pollutants on microbial communities\n\nis a complex task. It requires the study of a multitude of chemical and biological pathways,\n\nwhich may only be experimentally addressed in detail under controlled conditions.\n\nFigure A-2: One hundred years scenario of forms of iron in surface ocean waters considering the 0.4 pH units\ndecrease modelled by Caldeira and Wickett (2003), at 25\u00baC and salinity of 35.

(2009).\n\nSince coastal and estuarine areas are very different between them, modeling on speciation of metals in these areas\n\nis needed for a more complete and accurate scenarios.\n\nMicrocosm coupled with molecular biology technologies as an experimental\nframework\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\n161\n\nIt is important that we obtain a mechanistic understanding of the effects of ocean\n\nacidification and UVR on pollutant toxicity and degradation. Pollution events, however, occur\n\nover a wide range of spatial and temporal scales making it difficult to gauge cause-effect\n\nrelationships. This difficulty is enhanced when studying additional levels of complexity such as\n\ninteractive effects with different stressors. In such cases, small-scale models, such as micro-\n\nand mesocosms, can be useful tools.\n\nMicro- and mesocosms are simplified systems, constructed to mimic natural\n\nenvironments under controlled conditions (Roeselers et al., 2006). Both simplified systems are\n\npowerful tools that have facilitated the study of several ecological processes, including\n\nresearch on predator-prey coevolution, ecosystem level-selection, resource competition and\n\nadaptive radiation (Jessup et al., 2004). Both systems have advantages and disadvantages (Table\n\nA-1). The major advantage of these setups is that they enable a high degree of experimental\n\ncontrol and replication. The level of control provided is virtually impossible to obtain through\n\nstandard field surveys (Benton et al., 2007). In addition to this, micro- and mesocosms enable\n\nresearchers to experiment with highly toxic substances that would not be possible in situ.\n\nWhile there is some concern that these models are too small, both spatially and temporally, to\n\nbe useful, the goal of these experiments is not to fully reproduce nature in a laboratory model\n\nsystem, but rather to simplify complex ecosystems so that essential dynamics can be captured\n\n(Jessup et al., 2004). The distinction between micro- and mesocosms is somewhat arbitrary.\n\nMesocosms tend to be outdoor and larger in size, increasing biological and spatial complexity\n\n(Petchey et al., 2002), but diminishing experimental control and reducing replicability. In\n\ncontrast, small microcosm setups allow a degree of experimental control and replication that is\n\ndifficult to achieve with larger outdoor mesocosms.\n\nTable A-1: Main advantages and disadvantages of micro- and mesocosm experiments\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\n162\n\n+ - Limited\n\n++ - Moderate\n\n+++ - Full control\n\nOf course, the size and design of these experiments will always depend on the research\n\nquestion. Research on potential interactions between climate change and anthropogenic\n\npollutants can greatly benefit from the experimental control of small microcosm systems.\n\nMany field studies only provide correlative evidence of certain phenomena. Microcosm\n\nexperiments can help to elucidate whether there is an actual mechanistic effect. Additionally,\n\nsmall-scale experiments with microbes can overcome microcosm scale related limitations\n\nassociated with studying larger organisms. Due to the small size and short generation times of\n\nmicrobes, it is possible to simulate complex temporal and spatial scales within microcosms\n\n(Jessup et al., 2004). Climate change interactions with anthropogenic pollutants could be tested\n\nover several generations. For example, Collins and Bell (2006) simulated evolutionary\n\nresponses of Chlamydomonas populations exposed to increasing concentrations of CO2 using\n\nmicrocosm experiments. Nevertheless, temporal and spatial scales should be considered with\n\ncare when performing experiments with microbes. Enclosure within small experimental\n\ncontainers can induce shifts in microbial communities known as the \u201cbottle effect\u201d (Ferguson\n\net al., 1984). It is important to monitor microbial communities and determine the extent results\n\nare biased by microcosm enclosure.\n\nEnvironment Microcosm Mesocosm\n\nEase of replication + +++ ++\n\nPrecise control over environmental\n\nparameters\n\n+ +++ ++\n\nTreatments under investigation can be\n\nhighly controlled\n\n+ +++ ++\n\nSpace and temporal scale +++ + ++\n\nMultitrophic interactions +++ ++ +++\n\nFunctional ecosystem mimicry +++ ++ ++\n\nCircumvent over-simplification +++ + ++\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\n163\n\nCurrently, one of the key gaps in our understanding of how climate change may affect\n\nmicrobial communities is the lack of microcosm systems designed to simulate predicted\n\nscenarios in marine environments. For example, the effect of carbonate chemistry\n\nmanipulation on microbial communities has mainly been assessed in larger mesocosms.\n\nReliable microcosm systems designed to mimic fundamental dynamics of marine\n\nenvironments and capable of simulating climate change scenarios are needed. However,\n\ndeveloping microcosm systems capable of simulating climate change scenarios such as\n\nincrease UVR or ocean acidification is not a trivial task. For example, the spectral irradiance\n\nemitted by UVR lamps does not match natural solar irradiance. UVR lamps emit more short-\n\nwave and less long-wave UVR than the sun (Xu et al., 2010). A possible solution is to calibrate\n\nthe lamps with a biological spectral weighting function that describes the effectiveness of lamp\n\nwavelength to produce biological responses (Andreasson et al., 2006). However, this\n\nexperimental setup is complex for long term outdoor microcosm experiments since UVR\n\nlamps must be continuously calibrated in order to account for daily and seasonal light\n\nvariation. If the experimental setup does not involve wavelength isolation, microcosms can be\n\ndirectly exposed to sunlight. Recently, Gao et al. (2012) exposed microcosms directly to several\n\nlevels of solar radiation to simulate the synergistic effects of light exposure and increased\n\npCO2 in phytoplankton at different depths. Likewise, there are several methods that simulate\n\nfuture changes in seawater chemistry. CO2 bubbling, addition of high-CO2 seawater and\n\ncombined addition of acid and HCO3- are the three approaches that most closely mimic future\n\nscenarios of shifts in seawater chemistry (Gattuso et al., 2009). Probably, the easiest to\n\nimplement in microcosms is CO2 bubbling with pH stats systems. In these systems, pH is\n\nmonitored continuously and a controller valve increases or reduces the addition of CO2 when\n\npH deviates from a set value (Gattuso et al., 2009).\n\nAs referred to above, the use of microcosms to address fundamental ecological\n\nquestions is not new. However, this approach combined with recent advances in microbe\n\ncharacterization technologies can provide an important framework to start unravelling how\n\nclimate change and pollution may interact to affect several levels of biological organization\n\n(Figure A-3).\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\n164\n\nFigure A-3: Microbial microcosm couple with \u201comics\u201d technologies can provide an excellent tool to gain\nmechanistic insights into climate change and anthropogenic pollution interactive effects at several levels of\n\nbiological organization.\n\nThe recent development of molecular technologies has enabled scientists to assess the\n\nstructure and function of microbes in a range of different environments including soil,\n\nsediment, water and within animal and plant hosts. The development of high-throughput\n\nDNA sequencing technologies has been a milestones in the field of metagenomics and\n\nmetatranscriptomics. Metagenomic analysis, however, only provides structural and putative\n\nfunctional information of the microbes under study. In order to restrict focus to the active (as\n\nopposed to dormant, Urich et al. 2008) members of microbial communities and the genes\n\nexpressed, several protocols were developed to sequence actively transcribed RNA and\n\nmessenger RNA (mRNA) (also known as metatranscriptomics). Metatranscriptomic analysis\n\ncan facilitate the study of microbial responses to rapid environmental change (e.g. an oil spill),\n\nthereby linking structural shifts to community function (Mason et al., 2012). In parallel,\n\nadvances in efficient chromatographic separation coupled with mass spectrophotometry-based\n\napproaches have enabled high-throughput protein identification. The study of the entire set of\n\nproteins (proteome) produced by a given microbial community in a particular environment\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\n165\n\nhas led to a new field known as metaproteomics. Together with metagenomics and\n\nmetatranscriptomics, metaproteomics can facilitate the study of cellular responses to changing\n\nenvironmental conditions. Metabolite profiling in complex biological samples is also an\n\nemerging field. This new approach, known as metabolomics, involves the quantitative and\n\nqualitative analysis of the complete set of metabolites present in a sample, providing additional\n\ninformation on metabolic and physiological potential.\n\nWhile these technologies have greatly improved our ability to acquire data, they have\n\nalso created new challenges. The current rapid development of \u201comic\u201d technologies is unique\n\nin that it actually exceeds the rate of chip performance evolution in the computing industry,\n\nalso known as Moore's law (Gilbert et al., 2012). However, our ability to integrate the large\n\namount of \u201comic\u201d data is maturing rapidly. For example, the construction of co-occurrence\n\nand correlation networks from presence-absence or abundance data, in a process know as\n\nnetwork inference, is being increasingly used to predict microbial interactions (Faust et al.,\n\n2012). Recently, Larsen et al. (2012) used an artificial neural network to develop a model that\n\npredicts the abundance of microbial taxa as a function of environmental conditions and\n\nbiological interactions. This method can be seen as a first step in the application of bioclimatic\n\nmodeling to predict microbial community and environmental interactions under future global\n\nchange scenarios.\n\nMicrocosm simulations must be developed in line with data acquisition from the field\n\nand modeling. Microbial observatories that generate long-term data series from different\n\nhabitats and across several gradients (e.g., polluted versus non-polluted areas or areas of\n\nvolcanic activity where CO2 gas is released into the water creating a natural gradient of pH\n\nlevels (Hall-Spencer et al., 2008) can also provided valuable information on potential\n\ninteractive effects. Furthermore, data series such as these can be used to confirm or refute\n\nhypotheses formulated from microcosm experiments.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nUnderstanding the full extent of interactive effects of global climate change and\n\npollutants on microbes is a complex task, which entails the study of a multitude of\n\ninteractions. In addition to this, the information about these interactions is scarce and studies\n\nin this field are still in their infancy. Further studies are needed to evaluate how the effects of\n\noceanic pH and UV radiation (UVR) will affect microbial detoxification processes in marine\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\n166\n\necosystems. The experimental data gather so far allow us to predict that independent and\n\ninteractive effects of UVR and ocean acidification will probably affect microbial community\n\nstructure and function. Given the importance of microbial mediated processes, there is a\n\npotential for the disruption of key ecosystem services. At present, there are some major\n\ntechnical challenges that still need to be met with respect to reliable and replicable integrated\n\napproaches to simulate predicted climate change scenarios and evaluate how they will affect\n\nthe toxicity of pollutants and the functioning of microbial communities. This endeavour\n\ndemands statistically robust experiments under controlled conditions, where biological and\n\nnon-biological markers of environmental function can be accurately identified and quantified.\n\nMicrocosm experiments paired with new \u201comics\u201d technologies, along with field surveys can\n\nprovide an excellent framework to ascertain the effect of anthropogenic pollutant toxicity and\n\nmicrobial function under different climate change scenarios. It is important that we start to\n\nidentify interactions resulting from global climate change and anthropogenic pollution in order\n\nto mitigate known and novel environmental threats.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors acknowledge support from Centre for Environmental and Marine Studies\n\n(CESAM) and Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT, Portugal) PTDC/AAC-\n\nCLI/107916/2008 (http://alfa.fct.mctes.pt) and the European Regional Development Fund\n\n(ERDF) through COMPETE-(FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-008657).
