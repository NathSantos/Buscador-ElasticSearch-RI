In the Portuguese shelf and slope areas, adults are found on depths \n\nranging from 90 to 800 m depth. The distribution of this species seems to be limited to high \n\npercentage of mud bottoms. \n\nAlong the years this species acquired some importance in the fisheries sector due to its market \n\nvalue. It is nowadays one of the main species in crustaceans\u2019 bottom trawling in Europe. The \n\nfishing activity for the exploitation of this species has shown some environmental impacts. \n\nIn particular, trawl fisheries are known to directly impact the bottoms, and are associated \n\nwith considerable amounts of bycatch and discards. Recently, the European community has \n\nturned the attention to creel fishery for Nephrops, encouraging the change from trawl to creel \n\nin this fishery in order to reduce the bycatch.  \n\nDuring this study it was possible to observe that there is a clear difference between both gears \n\nin what respects the commercial value of Nephrops caught as well as in terms of species \n\naffected by the gears. \n\n \n\nKey words: Nephrops norvegicus, bycatch, trawl, creel, marine resources management \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter Index \n\n6 \n \n\nChapter Index \n\n \n\nDeclara\u00e7\u00e3o de autoria do Trabalho ..................................................................................................... 2 \n\nAcknowledgments ............................................................................................................................... 3 \n\nResumo ................................................................................................................................................ 4 \n\nAbstract ............................................................................................................................................... 5 \n\nChapter Index ...................................................................................................................................... 6 \n\nFigure Index ........................................................................................................................................ 7 \n\nTable Index .......................................................................................................................................... 8 \n\n1.

Introduction \n\n1.1. General concepts \n\n \n\nFisheries change the demographics of wild populations and the structure of ecosystems. \n\nThese changes are dependent on the type of fishery, gear and affected area. Evidences to \n\nsupport these changes on the ecosystems are well documented and still undergoing study. \n\nOne of the main issues is bycatch (Bell et al., 2008; Bellido et al., 2011; Catchpole et al., \n\n2006; Catchpole et al., 2010; Davies et al., 2009; Daw and Gray, 2005; Johnsen et al., 2011; \n\nKelleher et al., 2005; Pita et al., 2010; Wilcox et al., 2009). Bycatch is present in all types of \n\ngears, global marine fisheries data showing that bycatch represents around 40% of the total \n\nmarine catches worldwide (Davies et al., 2009). Part of the bycatch is composed by species \n\nwith commercial value, comprising up to 76% of the landed catch (Bojorquez, 1998), \n\ndepending on the type of fishery and gear used (m\u00e9tier). \n\nTo fully understand the importance of the biomass waste produced in fisheries there is a need \n\nto have a definition of catch and bycatch. Bycatch is a term extensively used in many studies \n\nnowadays with different meanings. There are three accepted definitions of bycatch. One of \n\nthe definitions currently accepted by the Fishery and Agriculture Organization of the United \n\nNations (FAO) describes bycatch as \u201cthat proportion of the total organic material of animal \n\norigin in the catch, which is thrown away or dumped at sea, for whatever reason\u201d (FAO \n\nFisheries Report No. 547 FAO, 1996). This definition does not include plant material and \n\npost-harvest waste such as offal (Alverson et al., 1994). Another definition refers to bycatch \n\nas the group of species discarded (Hall et al., 2000) and a third definition (OECD 2001) \n\nincludes in bycatch all the non-target fish retained and discarded. According to the \n\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) bycatch is \u201ctotal fishing \n\nmortality excluding that accounted directly by the retained catch of target species\u201d. This \n\ndefinition also includes fish that die as a result of interaction with the fishing gear, including \n\nmortality caused by \u201cghost fishing\u201d (OECD 2001). \n\nA more general definition of bycatch is currently used, and was adopted through this \n\ndocument, defining bycatch as the part of the catch that is constituted by the non-target-\n\nspecies. Taking these definitions into account, the quantity of biomass taken by the fishing \n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320711000930#b0030\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n10 \n \n\ngear may comprise the landed catch, including the target, accidental catches and non-target \n\nspecies that are marketable, and the discards, the catch fraction thrown back to the sea \n\n(Alverson et al., 1994). The species included in each group may change category depending \n\non a number of variables.  \n\nBycatch can then be sold or discarded, depending on the circumstances. Discards are a main \n\nissue, and there is a high number of reasons for discarding. Most common reasons include \n\nregulatory measures (species protected, stock status, fishing quota attained, undersized \n\nindividuals), and low market value (species with no value, damaged fish due to abrasion in \n\nthe gear or handling onboard). Other factors, as the lack of space on board or vessel freezing \n\ncapacity, among others, are also reasons for discarding. In such cases, only the most valuable \n\nspecies are retained, in a practice commonly known as high grading (Bellido et al., 2011; \n\nCatchpole et al., 2006; Catchpole et al., 2010; Davies et al., 2009; Daw and Gray 2005; \n\nJohnsen et al., 2011). Discarded species may include protected or stock managed species and \n\nthe lack of records on these catches may lead to failure on management policies (Catchpole \n\net al., 2006; Davies et al., 2009; Daw et al., 2005; Johnsen et al., 2011).  \n\nA major issue related to the amount of by-catch and discards is gear selectivity. In the past, \n\ngear modifications were put in place to increase catch efficiency, but at present there is a \n\nconcern to increase gear selectivity in order to avoid non-desirable, non-commercial and \n\nprotected species (Aldrin et al., 2012; Bellido et al., 2011; Costa et al., 2008; Johnsen et al., \n\n2011; Kronbak, 2009). This change in paradigm is related to the evolution of management \n\npolicies, from single-species to ecosystem-based management (Bellido et al., 2011; Hall et \n\nal., 2000; Johnsen et al., 2011; Simberloff, 1998). Although there are no conclusive studies \n\nabout the ecosystem effects of a very selective fishing, the side effects of the exploitation of \n\none species or a restricted group of species are considered preferred to the non-selective \n\napproach, due to the inexistence of market for the majority of bycatch species (Hall et al., \n\n2000). Another issue is market demand; while from an ecological point of view, the \n\nexploitation of species with lower trophic levels would lead to higher catch rates, market \n\ndemand focus mostly on high trophic level species like tunas, sharks and other top predators \n\nthat do not provide a sustainable fishery with high harvest rates (Hall et al., 2000). \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n11 \n \n\nBycatch can lead to conservation problems, when species caught include iconic species. \n\nThese include mostly marine mammals, sharks, sea birds and some marine reptiles, and \n\ncommercial species that cannot be caught due to regulatory measures (Simberloff, 1998). \n\nThese aforementioned reasons can lead to public concerns on protection of marine life, with \n\nmedia circles focused on the unaccounted mortality caused by fisheries activities (Hall et al., \n\n2000). \n\nConsequences of by-catch and discards go beyond the effects of mortality. The discarded \n\nbycatch will affect all the ecosystem by providing feeding opportunities to otherwise \n\nbalanced communities with proper biomass intake and outtake. These disturbances are more \n\nevident on areas with intense fishing activity, affecting the constitution and demographics of \n\nthe ecosystem, by indirectly benefiting scavenger communities and opportunistic species, \n\n(Catchpole et al., 2008b). \n\nBycatch issues have been ignored in fisheries management to a high extent. Many reasons \n\nmay account for this, as discards correspond to an \u201cinvisible\u201d catch fraction. The declared \n\ncatch on the port does not account for discards and hence only the data from landed catch are \n\navailable (Wilcox et al., 2009). This was less significant in the past, but with the increase in \n\nfishing effort resulting from the development of more efficient and less selective gears, the \n\nincrease in bycatch became a problem for stock assessment mortality estimates, (Daw et al., \n\n2005). Gear improvement allowed for extending the fishing activity to previously ignored \n\nareas and the increased pressure on the target species lead to a decline in the abundance of \n\nthese species (Johnsen et al., 2011). The attempt to maintain the catch levels high also \n\nincreased bycatch. However, the main management strategy is still based on single-species \n\nmodels, which do not take into account fisheries as a whole (Catchpole et al., 2006). \n\nNowadays, one of the main factors for regulatory bycatch measures is the accidental catch of \n\niconic groups as sea birds, mammals and sea turtles. The implementation of multispecies \n\nmanagement policies can imply fishing closures whenever the bycatch of such species \n\nexceeds pre-determined amounts (Simberloff, 1998).  \n\nGlobal discards have declined in recent years (Davies et al., 2009), nonetheless there are \n\nimportant exceptions. Deep-water fisheries in international waters are among these \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n12 \n \n\nexceptions; stock declines and quota restrictions resulted in fishing effort increase and a \n\nconsequent increase in discarded by-catch (Andrew et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n1.2. International and European Regulations for fisheries bycatch and discards \n\n \n\nOne of the most important international regulations affecting fisheries was the Third United \n\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in 1982. This convention was held \n\nwith the objective to create a common Law of the Sea for all the States involved, to \u201cpromote \n\nthe peaceful uses of the seas and oceans, the equitable and efficient utilization of their \n\nresources, the conservation of their living resources, and the study, protection and \n\npreservation of the marine environment\u201d(UNCLOS 1982). UNCLOS introduced the concept \n\nof exclusive economic zone (EEZ), an area over which a state has legal rights over the seabed \n\nand its resources. The EEZ extends the jurisdiction of coastal states from the previous 12 \n\nnautical miles (territorial waters) to 200 nautical miles beyond the shore line; as a \n\nconsequence, most of the natural exploitable resources fell under the management \n\nresponsibility of a country. It was expected that resources previously in international waters, \n\nwould be better protected and managed. \n\nSome guidelines for the sustainability of fisheries activities were proposed by FAO, resulting \n\nin the unanimous approval by the UN Council of the Code of Conduct for Responsible \n\nFisheries\u201d (FAO, 1995). Despite being of voluntary compliance, its principles have been \n\ngenerically adopted in fisheries strategic plans. \n\nAlong the years, several other conventions were approved to protect marine organisms like \n\nseabirds, dolphins and whales. Although in force, they were not able to solve the bycatch \n\nproblem, and in 2010 FAO issued the International Guidelines on Bycatch Management and \n\nreduction of Discards (FAO, 2010). This guideline had the objective to assist in the \n\nimplementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. \n\n  \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n13 \n \n\n \n\n1.3. The Common Fisheries Policy \n\n \n\nIn Europe, the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) was created to manage the European Union \n\nstocks, through the establishment and further enforcement of a number of management \n\nmeasures. A central measure is the total allowable catch (TAC) (Johnsen et al., 2011), setting \n\nup a limit for the total amount of fish which can be landed from a particular species and area. \n\nOther measures are of a more technical nature such as gear regulations, closed seasons and \n\nminimum landing sizes for individual species. Another cornerstone of the CFP lies in \n\ncontrolling the capacity of the fleets by limiting the number of licenses for some fisheries \n\nand/or the number at days at sea (Daw et al., 2005). \n\nThe International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES) produces a research report on a \n\nyearly basis which is then discussed by the Advisory Committee (ACOM). ACOM is \n\nresponsible for defining the current status and providing scientific advice for the different \n\nstocks. This report is discussed within the several committees on the EU, among them the \n\nScientific, Technical and Economic Committee on Fisheries (STECF) and the European \n\nParliament Fisheries Committee (Johnsen et al., 2011). These committees are responsible for \n\nissuing a number of proposals on management issues which are then sent to the EU Council \n\nof Ministers for analysis and approval.  \n\nThis approach to management can be understood as a top-down approach and it is widely \n\nregarded as having failed to successfully accomplish sustainable fisheries management in \n\nEurope (Johnsen et al., 2011). The responsibility can be attributed to different parties. \n\nTechnical and structural measures are rarely fully adopted at the policy stage and their \n\nenforcement is sometimes delayed due to economic or social interests prevailing over \n\necological sustainability (Johnsen et al., 2011). Political devaluation of fisheries science also \n\ncomes into play due to the inherent uncertainty of fisheries models and the resulting advice. \n\nThe over-simplification of the scientific advice leads to disregard by politicians and the \n\ngeneral public (Johnsen et al., 2011). This whole scenario contributes to an encouragement \n\nto the scientific community to focus on other questions, reducing the quality and quantity of \n\nmanagement-related research. Ultimately some blame can also be attributed to the scientific \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n14 \n \n\ncommunity, since fishers are more likely to be skeptical of scientific advice in which they \n\nhave little or no involvement (Pita et al., 2010).  \n\nConservation objectives have been clearly incorporated in the CFP since 2002 (EC, 2002). \n\nAfter a period of intense exploitation some stocks collapsed and the need for management \n\nwas enforced. Currently there is an increasing effort to create gears that allow, not only an \n\nefficient catch, but also reduce the bycatch. In the case of Nephrops stocks, the classification \n\nas \u201cbellow biologically safe limits\u201d has only been declared for the Iberian and Mediterranean \n\nstocks (ICES 2004). Management measures to recover Nephrops Iberian stock were adopted \n\nby reduction of the total allowable catch (TAC) (Harley et al., 2001; Abella and Rigini 1998). \n\nTechnical measures related to gear selectivity have been adopted by a number of European \n\ncountries (ICES 2004), but not in Portugal. \n\n \n\n1.4. Nephrops norvegicus - fishery \n\n \n\nThe Norway lobster is a highly valuable resource, with an average price of 13.01\u20ac/Kg in \n\nPortugal (first sale). It is an important source of revenue for the trawl fleet in general, and for \n\nthe crustacean trawl fishery in particular, and therefore its management needs to consider not \n\nonly the biological component but the social and economic dimensions of this fishery as well \n\n(Ungfors et al., 2013).  \n\nThe landings of Nephrops increased from 1950 until the mid of the 1980\u00b4s, stabilizing since \n\nthen at an average of 60,000t per year (Ungfors et al., 2013) (Figure 1.1). Coastal waters of \n\nthe Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean Sea show a decrease in landings even with \n\nincrease in effort, thus new management practices must be adopted (Abell\u00f3 et al., 2002). In \n\nnorthern countries, like Sweden, new policies were introduced to make this fishery \n\nsustainable and there is a gradual shift of the effort from trawling gear to creels (Ziegler et \n\nal., 2008). \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n15 \n \n\n \n\nData source: FAO landings data. \n\nFigure 1.1- European landings of Nephrops norvegicus.  \n\n \n\nThe main producer is the United Kingdom responsible for 28.5 thousand tones (56.8% of the \n\ntotal world catch) (Figure 1.2) in 2013, followed by Ireland with 8.4 thousand tones (16.8%). \n\nDenmark and France catch around 3 thousand tones (6.0% and 6.2% respectively) and the \n\nremaining countries involved in the fishery (with decreasing importance are Italy, Iceland, \n\nSweden, Spain, Netherlands, Germany and Portugal. \n\n0\n\n10000\n\n20000\n\n30000\n\n40000\n\n50000\n\n60000\n\n70000\n\n80000\n\n1\n9\n\n5\n0\n\n1\n9\n\n5\n3\n\n1\n9\n\n5\n6\n\n1\n9\n\n5\n9\n\n1\n9\n\n6\n2\n\n1\n9\n\n6\n5\n\n1\n9\n\n6\n8\n\n1\n9\n\n7\n1\n\n1\n9\n\n7\n4\n\n1\n9\n\n7\n7\n\n1\n9\n\n8\n0\n\n1\n9\n\n8\n3\n\n1\n9\n\n8\n6\n\n1\n9\n\n8\n9\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n2\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n5\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n8\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n1\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n4\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n3\n\nWeight (t)\n\nYear\n\nNephrops Landings\n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n16 \n \n\n \n\nData source: FAO landings data. \n\nFigure 1.2- Total annual landings of Nephrops per country. \n\n \n\nGears used \n\nThe main gear used to catch Nephrops is the bottom otter trawl. Trawling gear has been \n\ndeveloped along the years with different mesh types, cod ends and designs to increase their \n\nefficacy in catching the target species (Catchpole et al., 2008a). Trawl selectivity changes \n\naccording to the net section, the fore panels having large meshes so small organisms can \n\nescape, while the cod-end has a small mesh size to retain the target species. When trawling, \n\nthe longer the haul, the less selective the cod-end will be due to biomass accumulation in this \n\ntrawl section. (Kaykac et al., 2009).  \n\nManagement measures for Nephrops include annual total allowable catches (TACs), \n\nminimum landing size (MLS), closures in space and time, and specifically for trawlers, \n\nminimum codend mesh sizes (MMS) and maximum engine power. Regulations are not the \n\nsame for all EU countries. In Portuguese waters, MMS in Nephrops trawls is 70 mm (Portaria \n\n0\n\n10000\n\n20000\n\n30000\n\n40000\n\n50000\n\n60000\n\n70000\n\n80000\n\n2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\n\nCatches (t)\n\nUnited Kingdom Ireland Denmark France\n\nItaly Iceland Sweden Spain\n\nNetherlands Germany Portugal\n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n17 \n \n\n1557-A/2002, de 30 de Dezembro) and MLS is 20 mm (CL - carapace length). Both MMS \n\nand MLS should be based on maturation criteria that is, the MLS and the MMS length of \n\n50% retention, should be equal or above the 50% maturation size of the female maturation \n\nogive. This will mean that most individuals caught will have matured and reproduced at least \n\nonce (Ungfors et al., 2013). However the MLS of 20 mm is well below the L50 maturation \n\nlength of around 30mm, as indicated by Relini et al. (1998) for Algarve waters. It is also \n\nbelow the 50% retention in the legal mesh size of 70mm, around 25mm according to Fonseca \n\net al. (2007). Despite the very low percentage of individuals with 20 mm CL in a trawl catch \n\n(Frandsen et al., 2010; Fonseca et al., 2007), there is still an important proportion retained \n\nwith CL between 20 and 30 mm..  \n\nTrawls are among the less selective fishing gears and therefore the management of trawl \n\nfisheries must take into account all the bycatch, including commercially valuable and \n\ndiscarded species. Landings of commercial by-catch are usually recorded and therefore \n\nmanagement can be achieved for these species (Catchpole et al., 2008a; Doyen et al., 2012). \n\nDuring the last decades, new trawl designs were developed in order to decrease trawl bycatch. \n\nThese are commonly known by Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRD) and they contribute to \n\nexclude trawl by-catch either by sorting out unwanted species (physically or mechanically) \n\nor promoting escapement based on differences in behavior between crustaceans and fish \n\nspecies (Kronbak et al, 2009; Johnsen et al., 2011). Northern countries such as Sweden \n\nstarted to use BRDs such as species-selective grids in order to reduce the bycatch. A similar \n\ndevice was developed for the Portuguese Nephrops trawl fishery by Fonseca et al. (2005), \n\nconsisting of a grid sorting system, with a grid allowing the passage of Nephrops and rose \n\nshrimp to the trawl codend, while directing by-catch species to an upper trawl opening \n\nthrough which they escape from the trawl. However, these options are still not applied on \n\nsouthern European countries like Portugal (Johnsen et al., 2011). \n\n \n\nCreels are a passive gear deployed on the sea bottom and then hauled after a period of time. \n\nPresently, they account for a small portion of Nephrops catch, but before the development of \n\nindustrial trawling fleets most crustacean species, including the Norway lobster, were caught \n\nin creels. Recently, this gear is being increasingly used due to the efforts to reduce bycatch \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n18 \n \n\n(Ziegler et al., 2008). Creels are usually baited, in which case it is called a trap. The trap uses \n\na simple catch mechanism: the target species gets into the trap usually by passing through a \n\nnetting funnel (entrance), having its smaller opening turned into the inside of the trap, making \n\nit easy for the target species to get in but difficult to get out. This gear is highly selective, \n\nbeing characterized by very small amounts of bycatch (Ziegler et al., 2008). \n\nIn Portugal, the minimum mesh size for traps is defined according to the percentage of target \n\nspecies caught per haul (Portaria n\u00ba280/2002 de 15 de Mar\u00e7o: 8-24mm, 30-50mm and >50 \n\nmm with a minimum percentage of target species of 90%, 80% and 100% respectively).  \n\nBaited traps have increased efficiency due to the attractiveness of the bait. This is even more \n\nimportant on the sea bottom where the food-web is based on scavenging. In crustacean \n\ncreeling, the most common and cheaper fish species are used for bait, such as mackerel \n\n(Scomber scombrus) and sardine (Sardina pilchardus) (Ziegler et al., 2008). The fish are \n\nused whole in a similar condition to that used for human consumption, a situation that raises \n\nethical concerns. Previous attempts to use loins or rotten fish failed due to the lack of \n\nacceptance of the final product by the consumer caused by smell and flavor of the crustacean \n\nmeat that retained the bait smell and flavor. Artificial baits are being developed that can avoid \n\nthe degradation of the final product and solve the problem of the use of fish on baited traps \n\n(Ziegler et al., 2008). \n\nSeveral studies have shown that traps are efficient in economic and environmental terms in \n\nSweden (Ziegler et al., 2008), Iceland (Ungfors et al., 2013) and Portugal (Leoc\u00e1dio et al., \n\n2012). With the recent European policy of no discards (landing obligation), starting in 2015 \n\nwith pelagic fisheries and extending to demersal fisheries in 2016, all quota species, as \n\ndefined by catch limits in the TAC and quota Regulation, must be recorded, landed and \n\ncounted for the quota, including any by-catch of pelagic quota species when caught in \n\ndemersal operations (Defra, 2015).Therefore, the use of creels for these fisheries seems more \n\nand more profitable due to the dramatic reduction on the bycatch and the reduced fuel \n\nrequirements when compared with trawl fisheries (Catchpole et al., 2010; Leoc\u00e1dio et al., \n\n2012; Ungfors et al., 2013), making traps a sustainable gear from a biological, as well as \n\neconomic, point of view. \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n19 \n \n\n1.5. Nephrops norvegicus - biology \n\n \n\nReproductive cycle \n\nThe reproductive cycle in Nephrops changes according to latitude (Sard\u00e0, 1998). The \n\nincubation period can vary from 6 months, in the Mediterranean, to 10 months in Iceland, the \n\nmost northern populations having biennial spawns (Tuck et al., 1997; Tuck et al., 2000). The \n\neggs are extruded during summer and the larvae hatch in the end of winter or early spring, \n\nafter which the female populations undergo a process of moulting followed by matting. Egg \n\nspawning in the Portuguese coast takes place in August and September. The ovigerous period \n\nlasts about 28 weeks and hatching takes place from January to April (Chapman and Rice, \n\n1971; Sard\u00e0 1998).  \n\nThe larval phase includes three zoeal stages with temperature-dependent duration, ranging \n\nfrom 15 days (at 17\u00baC) to 45 days (at 8\u00baC) (Figueiredo et al., 1983). Nephrops zoeae are \n\nreferred to occur between the ocean surface and 50 meters depth (Figueiredo et al., 1983). \n\nThe larvae describe a diurnal vertical migration (DVM behavior pattern) which will affect \n\nthe dispersal distance (Figueiredo et al., 1983). Environmental factors have a very decisive \n\nrole during the zoeae development. Events such as offshore winds, that promote a stronger \n\noceanic drift and abnormal seasonal temperatures, result in shifts from the optimal range \n\nlevels for the development of Nephrops Zoeae, inducing years of poor recruitment that \n\nafterwards reflect on lower adult biomass (Figueiredo et al., 1983). \n\nGiven that the adults are mainly sedentary, the larval phase has a very important role in the \n\ngenetic connectivity between populations. Using DVM and with the influence of currents, \n\npopulations export and import larvae from adjacent populations maintaining the genetic pool \n\n(Stamatis et al., 2004). This species shows some genetic divergence at a regional scale, \n\nhowever genetic differentiation at the distributional range of the species doesn\u2019t seem to be \n\nsignificant to allow for the assumption of genetic isolation of populations (Stamatis et al., \n\n2004).  \n\nThe size of first maturation (smallest size at which 50% of the females display functional \n\nreproductive capacity, with ripe ovaries and spermatophores) also changes according to \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n20 \n \n\nlatitude. Studies by Figueiredo et al. (1983), point out that the age of first maturity \n\ncorresponds to the second and third year of life and is independent from size. However, data \n\nin Relini et al. (1998), using female Norway lobsters from the Algarve, indicate a 50% \n\nmaturation length at around 30 mm. According to Queir\u00f3s et al. (2013), some individuals \n\nwith physiological readiness to reproduce may not be able to do so either due to small body \n\nsize or underdevelopment of the body parts responsible for the mating process, a situation \n\nthat should be taken into consideration when defining \u201cmaturity\u201d. Moreover, the use of \n\nprimary sexual characters for the evaluation of the size of first maturation, may lead to \n\nunderestimation of the size of the onset of maturity (SOM) (Queir\u00f3s et al., 2013). In Tuck et \n\nal. (2000), SOM values for females are between 21-34 mm carapace length and 29-46 mm \n\nfor males. \n\n \n\nGrowth and moult \n\nThe moulting process is highly variable in length increment and moult frequency. These \n\nchange according to the conditions of the environment and from individual to individual. The \n\nmoult increment increases in absolute value with age, but is represents a higher percentage \n\nof the pre-moult size in younger individuals. The moult is more frequent in younger \n\nindividuals and upon reaching sexual maturity males can moult as much as twice a year until \n\nthey reach three, four years (Farmer 1973), while females will only moult once a year after \n\nmaturation (Sard\u00e0 1995). The combination of more frequent molts and higher percent \n\nincrease at moult in young individuals represents faster growth rates and an attenuation of \n\ngrowth rates with time can be observed in crustaceans as in other marine species such as fish. \n\nFor this reason, Nephrops growth can be represented by the von Bertalanffy growth curve. \u00b4 \n\nAge-length relationships do not show a clear pattern. Variability in growth, differences onset \n\nby the reproductive cycle and the absence of calcified structures that allow for exact ageing \n\nof individuals may account for the lack of such a pattern (Aydin and Aydin, 2011; Ayza et \n\nal., 2011).  \n\n \n\nBehaviour  \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n21 \n \n\nAs a burrowing decapod, Nephrops spends most of its time hidden, coming out mainly during \n\ndawn and dusk in shallow waters (Hammond and Naylor, 1977). In areas where their \n\ndistribution extends deeper than 150 m, the peak of activity slowly converges to a single peak \n\nthat occurs at noon (Chapman and Howard, 1979; Rice and Chapman, 1971; Ungfors et al., \n\n2013). During their emergence from the burrows these individuals scavenge the seafloor. \n\nStudies show Nephrops exhibits some degree of fidelity to the burrow with occasional change \n\nof location associated with the creation of a new burrow (Chapman and Howard, 1979), \n\nconsistent with short scavenging ranges. Their emergence rhythm is also conditioned by other \n\nfactors such as seasonal variations, bottom type, individual size and water turbidity \n\n(Chapman and Howard, 1979). \n\n \n\n1.6. Assessment and management of Nephrops norvegicus \n\n \n\nIn the North Atlantic, Norway, Iceland and the Faroe Islands manage their Nephrops fisheries \n\nindependently while in Europe these fisheries are managed under the Common Fisheries \n\nPolicy (CFP) (Johnsen et al., 2011; Ungfors et al., 2013). The current management policy is \n\na top-down approach with input measures including minimum mesh sizes, closed seasons, \n\nclosed areas. maximum number of days at sea and output measures such as total allowable \n\ncatch quotas (TAC), minimum landing size (MLS) and catch composition (Ungfors et al., \n\n2013).  \n\nIn Europe, the body responsible for the analysis of the scientific advice of the stock \n\nassessment and management from the International Council for the exploration of the Sea \n\n(ICES), is the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF). This \n\ncommittee provides an overview of the ICES advice together with an evaluation and \n\nrecommendation to the European Commission. Nephrops norvegicus is managed according \n\nto FUs, corresponding to stocks. Therefore an FU is defined as a subpopulation of individuals \n\nrestricted to an area where they share similar life parameters as growth, fecundity, \n\nrecruitment, mortality and, for management purposes, the same fishing mortality. Currently \n\nthere are 8 FUs for Nephrops in the Mediterranean and 34 FUs in the North Atlantic from \n\nwhich 29 are in EU waters (Ungfors et al., 2013).  \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n22 \n \n\n \n\nStock Assessment \n\nThere are multiple options for assessing stocks. For Nephrops, the most commonly used are \n\nsurplus production models (SPM), length based cohort analysis (LCA) and in recent years, \n\nabundance information from underwater video cameras (UWTV). \n\nSPMs are based on a series of catch (in weight) and effort. From these, the ratio catch per \n\nunit effort (CPUE) is related to effort and the model predicts the maximum equilibrium yield \n\n(MSY and the corresponding fishing effort (Fmax).It is assumed that CPUE is proportional to \n\nstock abundance (Cadima, 2003). Fishing effort usually corresponds to the number of fishing \n\noperations, or fishing time. This can be number of traps set per day, number of hauls, time \n\ntrawled or total soaking time (Harley et al., 2001). SPMs are easy to apply but they may be \n\ndeceiving because the ability of CPUE to indicate stock abundance is very limited. Marine \n\nspecies display assemblage behavior that changes according to the season, and fishers with \n\nthe capacity to predict this behavior attain high CPUE. Environmental causes can change \n\nthese concentrations and, if fishers continue to fish on those areas, the CPUE will be low \n\ncausing underestimation of the true stock abundance (Harley et al., 2001). Recent studies \n\npoint out that the use of CPUE as the exclusive method for management, may lead to the \n\ncollapse of a stock. Biological systems take time to answer to disturbances, hence a stock \n\nmay be collapsing while CPUE values stay high, only dropping when the stock gets below \n\nthe target reference points (Harley et al., 2001).  \n\nLCA is based on catch data (Hilborn and Walters, 1992). The inputs for the model are catch \n\ndata from commercial fisheries, fishing mortality rates derived from catch data and an \n\nestimated value of natural mortality. This method computes the number of individuals in the \n\nstock and its survivors, predicting the stock composition in the following year by using \n\nadditional information on recruitment and fecundity. However, it also requires growth \n\ninformation, in the form a function, usually the von Bertallanfy growth curve, which relates \n\nlength and age, a relationship difficult to obtain in crustaceans (Aguzzi and Sard\u00e0, 2012).  \n\nThe difficulty in obtaining age data is common to all crustaceans and results from the absence \n\nof permanent calcified parts, where growth rings can be formed. Traditional methods used in \n\nfish, where growth marks can be observed in otoliths or scales, do not have correspondence \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n23 \n \n\nin crustacean. The correlation between length and age is therefore difficult, and growth \n\ncurves are usually obtained with statistical techniques based on modal identification in length \n\nfrequencies. Von Bertalanffy parameters can therefore be obtained and used in assessment \n\nmodels to convert length into age. Length data conversion is flawed due to the growth \n\nplasticity in Nephrops and may lead to bias (Ungfors et al., 2013). Nevertheless, this method \n\nis considered to be the standard for Nephrops stock assessment, largely due to the absence of \n\na better one. The method is as good as the base data used and therefore, it is highly dependent \n\non the reliability of the fishers to report the catch (Aguzzi and Sard\u00e0, 2012).  \n\nImage based technologies made possible new procedures for Nehrops assessment. The use \n\nof cameras on trawls to assess Nephrops density was developed as an alternative to other \n\nconventional methods (Fonseca et al., 2008; Lau et al., 2012). With the creation of a proper \n\nalgorithm that can analyze video and images, this method seems to offer a faster and easier \n\nway to assess Nephrops density, although problems have been reported with this technique \n\n(Fonseca et al., 2008). Some limitations of this method has to do with the fact it counts \n\nburrows, not individual Nephrops. The second problem is that, while processing the image \n\nand identifying galleries, it is difficult to distinguish between primary entrances and \n\nsecondary openings, and the counting of galleries or identification of gallery systems is \n\ndifficult (Fonseca et al., 2008). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n24 \n \n\n \n\nManagement of Nephrops norvegicus \n\nPortuguese waters include 3 functional units: FU 27, 28 and 29 (Figure 1.3) which belong to \n\nICES area IXa. Records for Nephrops fisheries in Portugal are available in the FAO database \n\nsince 1950. Landings reached a peak at 3025 t in 1987 and progressively declined until 1995. \n\nIn 2012 the total landings were of 182 t (FAO landings 2012) (Figure 1.4).  \n\n \n\n \n\nSource of image: ICES, 2015 \n\nFigure 1.3-Nephrops functional units and management areas in subareas VIII, IX and X. \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n25 \n \n\n \n\nSource of data: FAO landings, 2012. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.4- Total annual catches of Nephrops in Portugal from 1950 to 2012. \n\n \n\nIn Portugal, Nephrops started to be caught as bycatch of hake fisheries (Costa et al., 2008) \n\nand thus the assessment in early years was mainly based on a rough estimate from the \n\nbycatch. As it started to attain economic importance, there was an allocation of part of the \n\nfleet to target Norway lobster (Castro et al., 1998; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2011; Ungfors et al., \n\n2013). Recent catch reports show a declining trend, which has been recorded since 1987. \n\nThis reduction in Nephrops catches caused the effort to be shifted to other crustacean species \n\nsuch as the rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris). Later the CFP established that all stocks \n\nshould be exploited at the maximum sustainable yield (MSY), but to put this directive into \n\npractice, the biological reference points must be known. The reference points of all the \n\nIberian Nephrops stocks are currently unknown, the only current assumption is that the stocks \n\nwere exploited above the MSY due to the low CPUE (ICES, 2012). The current management \n\npolicy is the maintenance of TAC and MLS, but the stock response has not been evaluated. \n\nIn Portugal, Nephrops is currently managed under the Recovery Plan for Nephrops and \n\nsouthern hake (Regulamento CE N\u00ba 2166/2005, de 20 de Dezembro).  \n\n \n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\n3500\n\nCatches (t)\n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n26 \n \n\nObjective of the study  \n\nThis study was developed with two main goals. One was to understand how traps and trawl \n\ngears affect the population structure of Nephrops. The other was to compare the impacts of \n\nthese gears on the benthic community, in particular on species that compose the bycatch. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nMethodology \n\n27 \n \n\n2. Methodology \n \n\nThis study was based on Nephrops population from FU 28 (SW coast of Portugal). The \n\nobjective was to compare the catches from two types of gear, traps and trawl, hence samples \n\nfor both gears were simultaneously taken in the same geographic location. This area is known \n\nas Mar de Sesimbra by the local fishermen. The area adjacent to the coast is a marine \n\nprotected area, the Parque Marinho Luiz Saldanha. This protected area covers 53km2 starting \n\nat Figueirinha\u2019s beach and ending in the Foz\u2019s beach, north of Cape Espichel. The continental \n\nshelf is narrow and the base of the slope, at around 1000 meters depth, is 20 km distant from \n\nthe coast. This is the area where Set\u00fabal and Lisboa canyons meet, which is limited at the \n\nsouth by a group of underwater hills (Infante Dom Pedro, Infante Santo and Infante Dom \n\nHenrique). \n\nThe crustacean trawler was 18.8 m overall length (LOA) and 8 m wide, fiberglass hull, gross \n\ntonnage (GT) of 69 t and engine power of 221 kW. The trap vessel (a polyvalent vessel \n\noperating several fixed gears, among them creels) was 15 m LOA, 23 GT, wooden hull and \n\nan engine power of 119 kW.  \n\nThe dates of the study were chosen in order to cover different seasons during the year. The \n\nsamples were obtained from 15th to 17th July 2014 (summer), 9th to 12th December 2014 \n\n(winter) and 17th to 19th March 2015 (spring). \n\nThe study was undertaken during regular fishing trips and had two conditioning factors: (1) \n\nnot interfering or slowing down the fishing operations, (2) only one person dedicated to data \n\ncollection in each vessel was available. Difficulties were of a different nature in each vessel. \n\nOn board the trawler, the working conditions were good but the amounts of catch and bycatch \n\nto process were overwhelming in most hauls. On board the trap vessel, the working \n\nconditions were very harsh (open deck and very little space to work). The sampling \n\nprocedures, for the catch and bycatch composition and Nephrops biological sampling, were \n\nadapted to those conditions to obtain sufficient data in the most efficient way. \n\n \n\n\n\nMethodology \n\n28 \n \n\n2.1 Trawl samples \n\n \n\nA standard commercial trawl net was used in the sampling, with a diamond mesh codend 70 \n\nmm mesh size. The GPS coordinates and time were registered at the start and the end of each \n\nhaul. A total of 17 tows were conducted during this study, 8 during the summer, 3 during the \n\nwinter, and 6 during the spring. The duration of the hauls was approximately 6 hours.  \n\nThe length composition of the target species, Nephrops, was obtained for each tow, from a \n\nrandom sample (2 to 4 kg) taken before sorting Nephrops by size. The standard measurement \n\nfor Nephrops was used, the carapace length (CL), the distance from the posterior border of \n\nthe eye socket to the center of the posterior border of the cephalothorax (Figure 2.1), \n\nmeasured to the lowest mm using calipers. During this process, the sex and the ovigerous \n\nconditions of the females were also registered.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1-Photo showing the standard length for Nephrops. \n\nThe catch was sorted out by the crew and Nephrops, as well as commercial bycatch, were \n\nseparated by species and weighted. The unwanted bycatch was stored in boxes before it was \n\ndiscarded at sea, the number of boxes was counted and one of the boxes was chosen to be \n\nsampled. This box was weighted, and all the species identified (presence/absence). The total \n\n\n\nMethodology \n\n29 \n \n\nweight of the discarded bycatch was estimated using, as extrapolation factor, the number of \n\nboxes.  \n\n \n\n2.2 Creel samples \n\n \n\nTraps were set on the ocean floor, at the edge of the trawling grounds, for 5 days (soaking \n\ntime). \n\nThe traps had a welded steel structure with dimensions 50x20x25 cm and were covered with \n\n5 mm plastic net mesh (Figure 2.2). They included a funnel shape entrance and a bait cylinder \n\npocket accessible from the outside. The entrance funnel had an inner opening of 15 cm and \n\nan outer opening of 25 cm, allowing the species to enter easily, but making the escape \n\ndifficult. The bait cylinder with filled with sated bait. The most common species used were \n\nthe largehead hairtail (Trichiurus lepturus) and Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus \n\ntrachurus), both chosen due to their low commercial value. Fish from previous fishing \n\noperations (from other trawling vessels from the same company) and of no value, were also \n\nused.  \n\n\n\nMethodology \n\n30 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2- Photo of one of the traps used during this study. \n\nThe trap line followed the typical basic design of this gear, with a main line sitting on the \n\nbottom to which the traps are connected through a short cable. The main line is attached at \n\neach end to a vertical line with weights on the bottom and floaters and signaling flags at the \n\nsurface (Figure 2.3). Individual traps have a secondary point of attachment to the main line, \n\nin order to increase the chance of recovery in case they get caught on the bottom. Each trap \n\nline consisted of 100 to 200 traps.  \n\n \n\n\n\nMethodology \n\n31 \n \n\n \n\nFigure source: Arana, 2014 \n\nFigure 2.3- Illustration of a trap line. \n\n \n\nDuring haul up all species caught were identified and counted. All the Nephrops were \n\nmeasured and sexed. Since no scale was available on board, the weight of the Nephrops catch \n\nwas obtained by adding the individual weights estimated by using a length-weight \n\nrelationship, applied to each sex, based on a sample previously obtained for the same area:  \n\n? = ???  \n\nWhere w is the weight in grams and L the length in mm. The parameters for females were \n\na=0.0091, b=2.3286 and for males a=0.00043 and b=3.1101. \n\n\n\nMethodology \n\n32 \n \n\nAll species other than Nephrops, in this gear, were either discarded at sea or kept for future \n\nuse as bait. This means that the fraction \u201cretained bycatch\u201d does not exist for this gear.  \n\n \n\n2.3 Biodiversity indexes \n\n \n\nThe level of information obtained for each species and fraction of the catch was the \n\nfollowing: \n\n? Target species, Nephrops: biological sampling (length distribution, sex ratio) and \n\ntotal weight per haul; \n\n? Retained bycatch (only for trawling): species list and total weight by species and haul; \n\n? Discarded bycatch: species list per haul (both gears) and total numbers by species \n\n(only traps). \n\nIn this situation, the only comparable information for all species and catch fractions was \n\npresence/absence (P/A).  \n\nBiodiversity indexes for presence/absence data were reviewed (Wilson and Shmida; 1984; \n\nColwell and Coddington, 1994; Koleff et al., 2003). Three indexes were applied (separately \n\nfor each gear), two of them based on the frequencies or rare species (Whittaker, 1960 in \n\nWilson and Shmida, 1984 and Lande, 1996 in Koleff et al., 2003) and one based on the total \n\nnumber of species present (index modified from Chao, 1984 in Colwell and Coddington, \n\n1994): \n\nequation 1) Whittaker 1960 \n\n?1 =\n?\n\n???\n? 1 \n\n \n\nequation 2) Lande 1996 \n\n?2 = ? ? ??? \n\n \n\n\n\nMethodology \n\n33 \n \n\n \n\nequation 3) Modified Chao 1984 \n\n?3 = ???? + [\n?(2? ? 3)\n\n?\n?\n\n?(? ? 2)2\n\n?(? ? 1)\n] \n\n \n\nwhere S is the total number of species recorded (all seasons), ??? is the average number of \n\nspecies per season, ???? is the number of species per season, L is the number of species that \n\noccur only once per season, M is the number of species that occurred in exactly two samples \n\nin a season and n is the number of samples per season. \n\nWhittaker\u2019s and Lande\u2019s indexes are based on the total number of species present in all \n\nseasons and the average number of species present in each season. In eq. 1, since ?>??, and \n\nassuming ? ?>1, ?1 will tend to have values close to zero at points of high diversity (where the \n\nratio ?/? ? will be only slightly above 1) and high values at points of low biodiversity where \n\n???? and the ratio ?/? ? >>1 (Koleff et al., 2003). The range of possible values for ?1 is] 0, S-\n\n1 [. \n\nThe same variables are used in a more direct way in eq. 2, where ?2 varies inversely with \n\nbiodiversity (Koleff et al., 2003). The range of values for ?2 is] 0, S [. \n\nEquation. 3 presents a different type of index, Chao\u2019s modified index, which is sensitive to \n\nthe presence of rare species, expressed by the variables L and M. This index values rare \n\nspecies and when presented with samples with no rare species (L=M=0), ?3=Sobs (Koleff et \n\nal., 2003). The quantity between brackets in eq. 3 is affected by L and M as well as the sample \n\nsize n that defines the multipliers for L and M. The multiplier for M, equal to (n-1)2/ (n2-n), \n\nis always smaller than the multiplier for L. The quantity between brackets tends to be \n\npositive, with higher values associated to high frequencies of rare species. In theory, ?3 can \n\nfall below Sobs if M is considerably higher than L (Koleff et al., 2003). \n\n  \n\n\n\nResults \n\n34 \n \n\n3. Results \n\n \n\n3.1.

(TP-trap lines, TR-hauls) \n\n\n\nResults \n\n35 \n \n\nTable 3.1 presents the sample size for Nephrons as well as the catch fractions (target species, \n\nbycatch discarded and bycatch retained) in the different hauls and Table 3.2 the percentages \n\nof each catch fraction in each haul. A total of 1027 Nephrons were sampled, 470 in the \n\nsummer, 145 in the winter and 412 in the spring. Nephrons represented around 4% of the \n\ntotal catch in weight and 22% of the bycatch had commercial value and was retained. Most \n\nof the catch was systematically discarded. The percentage of discarded bycatch varied \n\nbetween a minimum of 57% in Summer and a maximum of 92% in Spring averaging around \n\n75% in total. \n\nTable 3.3 and Table 3.4 include the species composing the bycatch discarded and the bycatch \n\nretained respectively. The most important retained species are the anglerfish and the hake, \n\nfollowed by the dogfish and the gurnards. All retained species were also discarded, including \n\nNephrops. There were multiple reasons for discarding. The most important one was lack of \n\nmarket value; this was the case for lantern shark, slimehead, pipefish, grenadier, lantern \n\nfishes, and hermit crabs, carrying crab, swimmer crab, whelks, sea urchins and sea \n\ncucumbers. For other species, such as conger, rockfish, megrim, anglerfish, greater \n\nforkbeard, rays, dogfish, rose shrimp, red shrimp, brown crab, Norway lobster and squid only \n\nthe small sizes are discarded. The curled octopus and the blue whiting, with catches quite \n\nuniform in terms of the size of individuals, are retained when the caught amounts are low, \n\nand discarded otherwise. For hake, the main reason for discarding is quota limitations.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nResults \n\n36 \n \n\nTable 3.1- Trawl \u2013 general information on the different catch fractions for the different hauls. \n\nSeason \nHaul \n\nID \n\nDuration \n\n(hours) \n\nNephrops \n\n \nDiscarded \n\nbycatch \n\n \nRetained \n\nbycatch \n\n \n\n(4) \n\nTotal catch  \n\n (1)   (3)    \n\n Sample size \n\n(Numbers) \n\nSample weight \n\n(kg) \n\nTotal weight \n\n(kg) \n\n Total \n\nweight \n\n(kg) \n\n \nTotal weight \n\n(kg) \n\nSummer TR 01 6.9 44 2.75 20 315  173 508 \n\n TR 02 5.2 47 3.66 18 345  185 548 \n\n TR 03 5.1 94 6.47 29 300  201 530 \n\n TR 04 7.0 49 2.76 23 360  118 501 \n\n TR 05 5.2 56 2.80 33 450  145 628 \n\n TR 06 5.5 65 3.83 24 390  58 472 \n\n TR 07 7.5 50 1.89 36 375  123 534 \n\n TR 08 4.9 65 4.19 26 360  64 450 \n\nTotal summer  47.3 470 28.35 209 2895  1067 4171 \n\nWinter TR 09 7.0 75 4.94 38 675  176 889 \n\n TR 10 5.5 38 2.48 41 720  178 939 \n\n TR 11 5.3 32 2.30 36 795  173 1004 \n\nTotal Winter  17.8 145 9.72 115 2190  527 2832 \n\nSpring TR 12 5.7 36 2.20 19 480  159 658 \n\n TR 13 3.6 65 3.85 32 840  282 1154 \n\n TR 14 7.6 144 10.19 18 660  222 900 \n\n TR 15 6.0 46 2.70 23 345  36 404 \n\n TR 16 8.2 54 2.54 10 465  30 505 \n\n TR 17 4.0 67 4.10 15 540  89 644 \n\nTotal Spring  35.1 412 25.58 117 3330  818 4265 \n\nTotal  100.2 1027 63.65 441 8415  2412 11268 \n\n(1) Sample weight estimated with the application of a weight-length relationship; (2) Corresponds to 1 box of discarded bycatch;  \n\n(3) Extrapolated based on number of boxes; (4) Total catch = Nephrops weight + retained bycatch + discarded bycatch. \n\n\n\nResults \n\n37 \n \n\nTable 3.2- Trawl \u2013 information on the proportion of the different catch components. \n\nSeason Haul ID Nephrops (%) Discarded bycatch (%) Retained bycatch (%) \n\nSummer TR 01 3.9 62.0 34.1 \n\n TR 02 3.3 63.0 33.8 \n\n TR 03 5.5 56.6 37.9 \n\n TR 04 4.6 71.9 23.6 \n\n TR 05 5.3 71.7 23.1 \n\n TR 06 5.1 82.6 12.3 \n\n TR 07 6.7 70.2 23.0 \n\n TR 08 5.8 80.0 14.2 \n\nTotal summer   5.0 69.4 25.6 \n\nWinter TR 09 4.3 75.9 19.8 \n\n TR 10 4.4 76.7 19.0 \n\n TR 11 3.6 79.2 17.2 \n\nTotal Winter   4.1 77.3 18.6 \n\nSpring TR 12 2.9 72.9 24.2 \n\n TR 13 2.8 72.8 24.4 \n\n TR 14 2.0 73.3 24.7 \n\n TR 15 5.7 85.4 8.9 \n\n TR 16 2.0 92.1 5.9 \n\n TR 17 2.3 83.9 13.8 \n\nTotal Spring   2.7 78.1 19.2 \n\nTotal   3.9 74.7 21.4 \n\n  \n\n\n\nResults \n\n38 \n \n\nTable 3.3- Trawl - species composition of the discarded bycatch (1-presence/0-absence) for the different hauls. \n\n \n\n   Summer Winter Spring \n\nSpecies \nTR \n\n01 \n\nTR \n\n02 \n\nTR \n\n03 \n\nTR \n\n04 \n\nTR \n\n05 \n\nTR \n\n06 \n\nTR \n\n07 \n\nTR \n\n08 \n\nTR \n\n09 \n\nTR \n\n10 \n\nTR \n\n11 \n\nTR \n\n12 \n\nTR \n\n13 \n\nTR \n\n14 \n\nTR \n\n15 \n\nTR \n\n16 \n\nTR \n\n17 \nFamily \n\nScientific name \nCommon \n\nname \n\n Fish                                 \n\nCongridae \nConger conger \n\nEuropean \n\nconger \n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \n\nSqualidae \nEtmopterus sp. \n\nLantern \n\nshark \n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \n\nScorpaenid\n\nae \n\nHelicolenus \n\ndactylopterus \nRockfish 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 \n\nTrachichthy\n\ndae \nHoplostethus sp.

TP represents trap samples and TR \n\nrepresent trawl samples. \n\nThe impact of the trawl fishery on benthic biodiversity is clearly higher when compared to \n\nthe traps. The difference is mainly associated with the active and passive nature of trawl and \n\ntraps. While the trawling sweeps the grounds and catches all species not able to run away \n\n(both benthic and benthopelagic), the traps stay on the bottom and catch only benthic species \n\nthat are attracted to the bait and do not exit the traps, mostly invertebrate scavengers. \n\n  \n\n6 6\n4\n\n7\n5\n\n1 1\n\n4\n5 5 5\n\n27\n\n24 24\n26\n\n25\n24 24 24\n\n26\n25\n\n26\n27\n\n26\n25\n\n26 26\n27\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nTP\n\n01\n\nTP\n\n02\n\nTP\n\n03\n\nTP\n\n04\n\nTP\n\n05\n\nTP\n\n06\n\nTP\n\n07\n\nTP\n\n08\n\nTP\n\n09\n\nTP\n\n10\n\nTP\n\n11\n\nTr\n\n1\n\nTr\n\n2\n\nTr\n\n3\n\nTr\n\n4\n\nTr\n\n5\n\nTr\n\n6\n\nTr\n\n7\n\nTr\n\n8\n\nTr\n\n9\n\nTr\n\n10\n\nTr\n\n11\n\nTr\n\n12\n\nTr\n\n13\n\nTr\n\n14\n\nTr\n\n15\n\nTr\n\n16\n\nTr\n\n17\n\nF\nre\n\nq\nu\ne\nn\nc\ny\n\nFrequency of occuring species\n\n\n\nResults \n\n46 \n \n\n \n\nThe usage given to the bycatch of the traps is more consistent, only Nephrops is kept for \n\ncommercial purposes. Although the bycatch species from the traps were only counted, while \n\nin the trawler they were weighted, the disproportion of the importance of the bycatch fraction \n\nin the two gears unequivocally indicates the much higher impact on bottom biodiversity of \n\ntrawling (Figure 3.3). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3-Proportion of the several constituents of the catch.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nTrawl-Summer Trawl-Winter Trawl-Spring\n\nTraps-Summer Traps-Winter\n\n\n\nResults \n\n47 \n \n\nThe biodiversity indexes (Table 3.8) as expected, were notoriously different between traps \n\nand trawls. ?1 and ?2 indexes are inversely related with the number of rare species while ?3 \n\nrepresents the number of species present and varies in opposite direction of the other indexes. \n\nThese indexes are derived from beta diversity indexes and time was our continuous variable.  \n\n \n\nTable 3.8- Biodiversity presence-absence indexes values. \n\nGear Season ? 1 ? 2 ? 3 \n\nTrawl Summer 0.091 2.25 26.36 \n\nTrawl Winter 0.052 1.33 26.33 \n\nTrawl Spring 0.032 0.83 27.00 \n\n     \n\nTraps Summer 1.143 6.40 15.25 \n\nTraps Winter 2.429 8.50 7.43 \n\n \n\nFor the trawling little differences were found among seasons for all the indexes. This means \n\nthat the composition of the catch, for the period of the study, had little changed. The variation \n\nin the seasonal values for these indexes is mainly due to the presence of three species, P. \n\nblenoides, L. vulgaris and skates. The differences between seasons are more pronounced for \n\nthe traps, but since the species count is based on rare occurrences of most species, the index \n\nvariation may be biased.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nResults \n\n48 \n \n\n3.4.

Discussion \n \n\nThe purpose of this study was to compare the species diversity of the catch and the size \n\nstructure of Nephrops between two gears targeting the same species (Nephrops) in the same \n\narea. The fishing operations of both gears were conducted in the same area and at the same \n\ntime, in order to guarantee that the biotic community and Nephrops population are the same. \n\nComplete overlap of the areas was not possible, because the trawling activity is not \n\ncompatible with the presence of fixed gears, but the bathymetry was similar and the fishing \n\ngrounds contiguous (Figure 3.1). The coordination of the operations between the two \n\nskippers was guaranteed by using vessels from the same company.  \n\nNephrops trawl activity and trap fisheries have been the focus of several studies, and several \n\nareas of Europe have different policies to allocate effort between traps and trawls. Creel \n\nfisheries for Nephrops are well established in Nordic regions such as Western Scotland and \n\nthe Swedish Skagerrak. In the Faroe Islands a sustainable creel fishery developed where \n\ntrawling was banned and in other European regions creels are being currently tested as an \n\nalternative to trawls as is the case of the North eastern part of the Adriatic Sea. In other areas, \n\ncreeling operations are experimental (the central Adriatic sea, Morello et al. 2009) or at a \n\nreduced scale (Portuguese coast, Leoc\u00e1dio et al.2012). \n\nWith respect to faunistic diversity of catches and quantities of by catch, the higher values for \n\nthe trawl are not a surprise. Similar results were attained in all studies where traps were \n\ncompared to trawls. A total of 27 species belonging to 26 families were captured. All species \n\nwere present in the trawl but only 13 on the traps. The number of species present in each haul \n\nwas consistently higher than the corresponding number in each trap line, indicating much \n\nhigher impact of trawling on bottom biodiversity. This impact is even higher when it is \n\nanalyzed in terms of biomass or number of individuals, much higher in the trawl when \n\ncompared to traps.  \n\nIn several studies comparing trawl and trap fisheries similar conclusions were reached. \n\nTrawls have a higher impact in terms of biomass, both from the target species and the \n\n\n\nDiscussion \n\n51 \n \n\nbycatch. The main issue with trawl fisheries is the high proportion of unwanted catch (species \n\nand biomass), usually more than half of the catch being discarded at sea. This is true for most \n\ntrawl fisheries (Alverson et al.1994), especially those targeting crustaceans. Some countries \n\nhave developed ways of using this bycatch, reducing the amount of discards. An example is \n\nthe shrimp trawl fisheries in China where most bycatch is landed to produce fishmeal (Chiu \n\net al., 2013), a procedure replicated in South American countries. Some other countries have \n\ndeveloped other ways to deal with the discard problem such as Canada and Northern \n\ncountries that have enforced the use of by-catch reducing devices in trawls, for example grid \n\nsorting systems or square mesh windows, allowing the escapement of a significant fraction \n\nof the unwanted catch (Alverson et al.1994). \n\nTrawl impacts are also generally high on the sea floor (Guijarro et al.,2011; Mart\u00edn et al., \n\n2014). The trawl doors scrap the ocean floor during their activity, destroying any structures \n\npresent in their path. The movement of the vessel will also cause pressure on the gear, \n\nresponsible for abrasions in the catch and even the death of some individuals due to crushing \n\n(Guijarro et al., 2011). Once inside the trawl net, escapement is possible but the injuries \n\ninflicted to the individuals during the process are of such an extent that most individuals will \n\ndie; all these factors will affect the real mortality caused by this gear (Leoc\u00e1dio et al., 2012). \n\nThis is relevant for this study because it was noticed that the individuals of most species \n\narrived at the deck either dead or with serious injuries. Mortality of the bycatch will be very \n\nhigh even for small fish and crustaceans that are discarded, leading to the question of whether \n\nthe use of this type of gear can be justified and sustainable, having into account the small \n\namount of catch retained for commercial purposes (Guijarro et al., 2011). \n\nThe effects of the traps on the sea bottom are less important, but still not negligible. Some \n\nstudies indicate that the deployment of this gear can lead to disturbances on the sea bottom \n\n(Leoc\u00e1dio et al., 2012), but most criticisms come from the unseen bycatch of this gear (Hall \n\net al.,2000). A hypothesis could be that the bycatch species present in the traps are rare \n\nevents, but the long soaking time of the traps may lead the capture of species that are \n\nconsumed by predators or scavengers and are never accounted as bycatch. It has been \n\nregistered that some species of predators can freely enter the traps and feed on the catch. This \n\nbehavior has been recorded in several trap fisheries, with species such as Octopus magnificus \n\n\n\nDiscussion \n\n52 \n \n\n(Groeneveld et al., 2006), using the traps to get easy meals (Favaro et al.,2010; Raby et al., \n\n2014; Watanuki et al.,2000).  \n\nWith the acknowledgement of the importance of managing fisheries at an ecosystem level \n\nand reducing discards, the renovation of stocks by safeguarding juveniles has been enforced, \n\nand traps fisheries have increased in the recent years. During this study it was possible to \n\nobserve that the majority of the trawl catch had no commercial value, mainly due to the \n\nabundance of undersized individuals and unmarketable species. Another factor was the \n\ndegree of damage observed in a high number of individuals. \n\nContrary to trawls, creels yielded little or no bycatch with individuals of commercially \n\nimportant species rarely caught. Most of the individuals caught belonged to the family \n\nBuccinidae and were discarded due to the lack of commercial value. \n\nThe higher impact of trawling has to do with the nature of the gears and with their fishing \n\nprocess because trawling relies on the engine power to drag the net throughout the ocean \n\nfloor catching most of the individuals in the area swept while in the creel case, the catch will \n\ndepend on the attraction power of the bait and access to the creel entrances (Morello et al., \n\n2009). \n\nThe size distributions of Nephrops caught by creels and bottom trawling were different. The \n\ntrawl catch was composed of a wide size range (30 mm to 75 mm) but 50% of the individuals \n\nwere below 43 mm carapace length whereas the trap catch was composed of large size \n\nindividuals (42mm to 76mm) with the exception of a single individual with 15 mm. The \n\nselectivity for larger individuals, mostly males, is commonly recorded in creel fisheries and \n\nthis is attributed to behavioral differences (Morello et al., 2009). Selectivity for larger sizes \n\ncan be double edge sword, on one side it guarantees that smaller individuals survive to reach \n\nreproductive size, on the other side it can lead to a decrease in the age of first maturity, an \n\neffect that has been widely reported on fish species (Cubillos et al., 2014). \n\nThe condition and size of Nephrops changes their market value (Eriksson 2006; Milligan et \n\nal., 2009; Leoc\u00e1dio et al., 2012; Ridgway et al., 2006). This is largely evidenced for the ex-\n\nvessel price (DGRM 2015). In 2014, the price per Kg of Nephrops caught with a trawler had \n\na mean value of 13.47\u20ac/kg while the price per Kg of Nephrops caught with traps was \n\n\n\nConclusion \n\n53 \n \n\n40.45\u20ac/kg. This gap in value is due not only to size differences but also because individuals \n\ncaught with traps arrive on deck alive, are kept alive in tanks on board and are sold alive. \n\nMarkets nowadays value fresh products due to their quality and therefore individuals sold \n\nalive provide an opportunity to value trap fisheries (Eriksson 2006;, Milligan et al., 2009). \n\nAlthough the trawl caught roughly 3 times the amount of Nephrops, the ex-vessel value for \n\nthe traps was 3 times higher, and total income from Nephrops was not much different \n\nbetween the two gears. However, when valuing both fisheries, trawling had the added income \n\nfrom the bycatch species. During this study, a total of 11 bycatch species were kept, of which, \n\nat least two of the most abundant, anglerfish and hake, reach high market prices.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5. Conclusion \n \n\nWith all considerations in mind, the sustainability of Nephrops fisheries should be improved \n\nand two kinds of actions are suggested. One aspect is the improvement of selectivity with \n\ngear modifications such as BRDs. Some of these devices were tested with good results in the \n\nPortuguese crustacean trawling fleet and the retention of important bycatch species, such as \n\nblue whiting Micromesistius. poutassou, can be significantly reduced (Fonseca et al., 2005, \n\n2007). These management measures can be important for the south coast, where traps do not \n\nseem to be, at this point, a viable option, due to, Nephrops smaller sizes in this area when \n\ncompared to the southwest coast. A second line of action should be the exclusion of trawlers \n\nfrom certain areas, allowing the expansion of the creel fishery, at the moment restricted to \n\nareas inside the 6 miles limit or in a few other small areas of hard bottoms inaccessible to \n\ntrawling. This approach would be important for the Southwest coast from Sesimbra to Cape \n\nSt. Vincent. In this region, the exclusion of trawling between the 6 and 12 miles would not \n\nrequire negotiations at the EU and could be very positive, not only for the creel fisheries but \n\nfor other fixed gears as well. The added income such a measure would bring with improve \n\nthe economic sustainability of local polyvalent fleets. If such a management measurement is \n\nimplemented, studies should be conducted in order to evaluate the effects of the gear change, \n\n\n\nConclusion \n\n54 \n \n\non all aspects of fisheries sustainability namely, ecosystem recovery and socioeconomic \n\naspects. \n\nOther factors should be considered when comparing gears, for example fuel consumption, \n\nemployment and social conditions. With respect to fuel, a previous study done on the same \n\nfleets showed that during one day of activity the trawler spent 9 times the amount of fuel \n\nwhen compared with the trap vessel (Leoc\u00e1dio et al., 2012). With respect to employment, the \n\ntrap vessel can accommodate up to 6 crew member (usually 5 at a given time) and the trawler \n\nemploys 7 crew members. The multiplication factor (jobs generated) maintaining the \n\nworking conditions, are clearly better in the trawler. In the trap vessel all work is done on an \n\nopen deck with much worst conditions for resting, having meals or taking care of personal \n\nhygiene. A conversion of the fleet needs to consider comfort and safety conditions for the \n\nvessels crews. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nReferences \n\n55 \n \n\n6. References \n \n\nAbella, A., Righini, P., 1998.
