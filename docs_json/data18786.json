The huge regional diamondiferous potential is viewed in a global\n\nperspective, firstly based on the edification of the Congo Craton from an Archaean nucleus, till several mobile belts accreted successively to that core.\nIn this cratonic block the geothermal gradient variation and the stability curve of diamond are determinant both in the genesis and the transportation\n\nof this precious mineral up to the surface.\nFollowing this, we analyse the tectonosedimentary evolution of the Congo Basin, an enormous depression in central Africa; where the depo-\n\nsition of thick sedimentary sequences is a consequence of an endorheic drainage, that begins in the upper Palaeozoic and has its maximum expression\n\nin the Meso-Cenozoic. The sedimentological processes, essentially terrigenous and continental, is controlled by the pre-Atlantic deformation of the\n\nCongo Craton and reaches a critical point with the opening of the South Atlantic since the Cretaceous . The oceanic rifting produces important tectonic\nconsequences in the African plate, reactivating structures from previous orogenic cycles. These structures exerted the control of kimberlite emplace-\n\nment and associated alkaline ring structures.\nThe sedimentological analysis and the lithostratigraphic definition of post-kimberlites sedimentary units are emphasised: Kwango Group,\n\nKalahari Group and Quaternary deposits, formed in successive erosion/deposition cycles with consequent reworking of its diamond content. These are\n\nviewed with an exploration and economical potential.\n\nFinally, a critical balance is made and the economical consequences of these vast diamondiferous resources are discussed based on future\n\neconomic perspectives.\n\nPalavras-chave: Cratao do Congo; controlo estrutural da implantacao de kimberlitos Ilamproitos; abertura do Atlantico Sui; fragmentacao\ndo Cratao do Congo; evolucao da Bacia do Congo; Grupo do Kwango; Grupo do Kalahari; depositos quaternaries; reservas diamantiferas .\n\nResumo: No presente estudo, apresenta-se uma sintese da geologia da Lunda (NE de Angola) com vista a urn melhor entendimento das\nocorrencias de jazigos primaries e secundarios de diamante .

Despite the fact that this region is extremely rich\nin diamondiferous gravels and in mineralised kimber-\nlites, the diamond mineralisation practically extends to\nthe entire area of Angola. However the Lunda geology\nencompasses all kinds of diamond ores and thus, its\nknowledge is very important in exploration programmes.\n\nTaking this into account, this work deals mainly with\nthe geology of the Lunda area. However, it is also neces-\nsary to focus on some aspects of the general geology of\nAngola, namely the Congo Craton evolution and some\ncontinental sedimentary units pre and post -kimberlite\nemplacement, that are important to the overall compre-\nhension of the diamond problem in Angola.\n\nThe diamond exploration in the Lunda province is\nreported to have started in 1912 with the finding of 7\ndiamonds in the Mussalala River, an east ern margin\ntributary of the Chiumbe River. With the adequate technical\nsupport, diamond exploration began in 1913, which\nresulted in the opening of the first open cast mines in\n1919 - Cavuco, Camimanga, Cassanguidi and Luaco\nmines. Since then until the year of 1999, about 63,6 x 106\n\ncarats were produced, in addition to the estimated 9 x 106\n\ncarats illegally explo ited between the years 1984-1999.\nThe ongoing exploitation works are conducted both in\nkimberlites and in eluvio-aluvial gravels.\n\nIn the past, the main exploitation activities were\ndeveloped essentially in alluvial deposits, either in recent\nalluvial gravels related with the present drainage system,\nor in other sedimentary units which post-date the kimber-\nlite intrusions. The most significant is the Calonda\nFormation, a Cretaceous continental unit considered as\nthe first sedimentary collector of diamonds after the\nsupergenic destruction of the kimberlites. The sedimen-\ntary diamondiferous deposits that are linked to the\npresent river system drainage activity are associated with\nthe erosion of the Calonda Formation basal conglome-\nrates.\n\nThe continual depletion of reserves in recent alluvial\ngravels rich in diamonds demands that new efforts be\nplaced on diamond exploration, which in spite of current\nsmuggling, new findings are possible. However, the\nfuture main target in alluvial exploration and mining\nshould be the Calonda Formation basal gravel, even with\nthe inconvenience of the high overburden thickness that\nreaches frequently 50 to 80 meters or more.\n\nRegarding the primary diamond sources, several\nhundred kimberlite bodies are known in Angola. Less\nthan 50 % of these kimberlites were studied and, from\nthese, less than 5 % are economically exploitable. Among\nthese bodies, there are three that are in the 10 biggest\ndiatremes in the world. In the past, only the upper yellow\nground levels were exploited and a large amount of\nproven reserves are still unexploitable. Recently, new\nfindings of kimberlites in Lunda have been reported. In\nthe present state of knowledge the diamond reserves in\nprimary sources still unknown, but a huge potential is\ndevised in view of the alluvial ore grades.\n\nBecause of this, there is a growing interest in the\nprimary diamond sources and some contracts have been\nestablished with international companies for exploration\nand mining of primary sources.\n\nThe prolonged mining history of Lunda diamonds,\nthe data relative to past and present mining activities, the\nvast areas with huge mining potential both for primary or\nsecondary diamond deposits, and the end of civil war\nwith progressive stabilization of social and political life\nin the country justifies the renewed interest for diamond\nexploration in Angola, and consequently in the geology\nof the Lund a Provinc e. Table I shows a synopsis of\nLunda geology, with the geological units grouped\nconsidering the main tectonic cycles recognised in\nAngola.\n\nThe Congo Craton\n\nThe occurrence of a Precambrian cratons, especially\nthose of Archaean age, have long been recognised as a\nmajor guideline for the exploration of primary diamond\ndeposits - Clifford's rule (e. g. CLIFFORD, 1966;\nJENNINGS, 1995 and references therein). This empirical\nrule has been explained with the geological conditions\nfor the preservation of diamonds, which occur domi-\nnantly under these Archaean cratons, until a volcanic\nepisode brings them to the surface (e. g . HELMSTAED &amp;\nGURNEY, 1995).\n\nThe influence of the geological nature of the cratonic\nbasement, in the location of the kimberlites, is paradig-\nmatic in the case ofAngola. It is notorious the dominance\nof kimberlite occurrences in Archaean terranes that are\ncharacterized by amphibolites, amphibolitic gneisses, '\nmafic granulites and charnockites. The kimberlite pro-\nvinces, defined by RBIS (1972), are coincident with the\nzone of influence of the Archaean tectonometamorphic\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\nTectonic events and lithostratigraphic units in Lunda Province (NE Angol a)\n\n191\n\nCHRONO-\n\nSTRATiGRAPHY\nLITHOSTRATiGRAPHY TECTONICS\n\nKALAHARI GROUP EROSION\nPLIOCENE Ochre Sands and Clays Fm\n\nEOCENE- Gres Polimorfos Fm\nEROSION -HIATUS\n\nMIOCENE\nEROSION -HIATUS\n\nKWANGO GROUP\nCalond a Fm:\n\nCENOMANIAN Arenit es and silcrete s; mudstone s; conglomerate intercal ations;\n[g Arenites and arkoses of different colours; reddi sh muddy arenites ; EROSION\nC\n\nCoars e basal conglomerate .

The Eburnean crust, on the\ncontrary, composed by gneisses, migmatites and large\nscale granites, is mainly acid, due to the fusion of the\n\naluminous metasediments and little recycling of previ-\nously formed crust. The granitoid domain of this\nEbumean crust seems to reveal incompatibility with\nkimberlite emplacement.\n\nWith this in mind, a description is made about the\nmain tectono-stratigraphic units that constitute the craton\nand the corresponding orogenic events, with the aim of\ndissociating the cratonic core from the various frag-\nments, successively accreted through Precambrian times.\n\nANGOLA\n\n14\u00b0 16\u00b0\n\n40 80 120 160 200\nLd Ld I\n\n18\u00b0 20\u00b0 22\u00b0 5\u00b0-\n\n7\u00b0__\n\n9\n\n15\u00b0 ---\n\n17\u00b0\n\nFig. I - Precambrian basement of Angola - Geological Sketch Map. Adapted after International Geological Map of Africa, 1:5000 000 scale,\n(UNESCO, 1986); CARVALHO (1983); ARAuJO &amp; GUIMARAES (1992) .\n\n\n\nThis distinction is of particular importance, because the\nrelation between the geothermal gradient and the\ndiamond equilibrium curve defines stability zones for\nthis mineral under the craton ic cores and instability zones\nunder the mobile belts (HAGGERTY, 1986).\n\nArchean cratonic nucleus\n\nThe diamondiferous area of Lunda is situated in the\nCongo Craton, which comprises an Archaean mafic\ncharnockitic complex . Around this Archaean core several\ngneissic -migmatitic series and Palaeoproterozoic grani-\ntoids were accreted whereas Meso- or Neoproterozoic\nmetasedimentary belts were disposed around the external\nlimits of the Congo Craton.\n\nThe oldest isotopic data (Rb/Sr and U/Pb) indicates\nan age between 2.9 - 2.85 Ga for the chamockitisation of\nthe mafic complex (norites, tonalites and amphibolites)\n(DELHAL &amp; LEDENT, 1971; DELHAL et al., 1976). In\ngeneral , this complex is composed of acid and mafic\ngranulites , quartzites, amphibolitic gneisses and amphi-\nbolites .\n\nNear the border with the Congo Democ ratic Republic\na suite of gneisses , migmatites and granitoids crops out\nalong the valleys of Chicapa and Luachimo and are\nincluded in the so called Dibaya Group of the Kassai\nregion (Congo), and associated with the mafic char-\nnockitic complex. Here, the U/Pb concordia, obtained\nfrom zircons and titanites, suggest an age of 2.65 Ga\n(DELHAL et al., 1975).\n\nIn addition to the mafic chamokitic complex and the\nDibaya rocks, some authors (MONFORTE, 1988) consider\nthe existence, in the Lunda area, of an older Basal\nComplex composed of amphibolitic schists, gneisses,\nmigmatites and granitoids, which is not, in our opinion,\nseparate from the Dibaya Group in terms of its lithology,\nmetamorphism and structure . In fact, in the referred\nunits, the foliation has a NE-SW to ENE-WSW direction\nand is affected by various deformational phases with\nhinge folds oriented NW-SE and NNE-SSW, probably\ndue to superposition of later orogenic cycles. Therefore,\nthe ages of the basic magmatism and the original crust of\nthe Basal Complex and/or the Dibaya Group may be\nolder, but that crust was certainly regenerated, structured\nand metamorphosed in a large period oftime (2.9 \u00b1 0.2 Ga).\nThe metamorphism is amphibolitic or granulitic facies\nwith the presence of acid granulites (chamockites) and\ngneissic intermediate-basic rocks (tonalites and norites)\n\n193\n\nthat can be explained by a process analogous to the for-\nmation of the present-day magmatic arcs and subsequent\nmechanisms of subduction / A-type collision (KRONER,\n1981; 1983).\n\nThe various mobile belts, Luizian-Ubendian (Ebur-\nnean) , Kibarian and Pan-African that are successively\naccreted to the Congo cratonic core have a weak expres-\nsion in the Lunda region . However, they are worth\nconside ring, due to the fact that some of the structures\nthat preserve the metasedimentary sequences representa-\ntive ofthose tectonic events correspond to grabens whose\nfaulted limits control the kimberlite emplacement.\n\nEburnean-Ubendian Cycle\n\nThe behaviour of the Archaean crust, present in\nLunda and other zones of the centre and west of Angola,\nrelative to the development of the successive orogenic\ncycles (CARVALHO &amp; ALVES , 1993) is further analysed .\n\nDuring the period of Archaean-Proterozoic transition\nit suffers extension, mantle pounding, rupture and, in\nsome cases, intrusion of mafic-ultramafic masses, for\nexample, the gabbro -anorthositic complex of SW Angola\nwith a N-S direction along an extension of more than\n200 km, and, certainly, some of the mafic intrusions of\nLunda. These great mantle masses induce partial fusion\nof the Archaean crust and formation of granitoids and\ngranodioritic porphyries that, in the westem part of\nAngola, clearly marks the fragmentation of that same\ncrust. In the Lunda sector, that fragmentation has a\nWSW-ENE general orientation and gives way to impor-\ntant subsiding zones, where sedimentary, generally silici-\nclastic, sequences accumulate, and are now outcropping\nas medium to high-grade metamorphic rocks accreted to\nthe Archaean nucleus during the Ebumean-Ubendian oro-\ngeny. In Lunda, these are divided, from the base upwards\nin the Lower Metamorphic Group (L6vua/Luiza Group)\nand the Upper Metamorphic Group (Lulua Group):\n\nThe L6vua Group, equivalent to the Luiza Group of\nKassai , is also present in Mufo, Luembe River, in the\nprolongation of the Kassai Group (Delhal and Ledent,\n1973; Andre , 1993). It is composed of a thick sequence\nof quartzites, itabirites, micaceous schists and, in some\nplaces, amphibolites and gneisses. The Rb/Sr metamor-\nphism age ofthese sequences is ca. 2.2 \u00b1 0.1 Ga (DELHAL\n&amp; LEDENT, 1973).\n\nAlso in Congo, close to the NE Angola border, a\ngraben with the same WSW-ENE fracture direction,\n\n\n\n194\n\nseparated from the Dibaya Group by the Malafudi fault,\npreserves a low-grade metasedimentary sequence, named\nthe Lulua Group . It is composed of schists , quartzites and\nbasic volcanic rocks (continental tholeiites) considered\nas Kibarian (DELHAL &amp; LEGRAND, 1957; FIEREMANS,\n1958; 1986) and always considered connected to the\nmetasediments that occur in the Luembe River, in Angola\n(ANDRADE, 1953a; MONFORTE, 1988). However, the\nRb/Sr dating of the metamorphism affecting the basic\nvolcanic rocks yielded an age of 1901 \u00b1 41 Ma (AND RE,\n1993). This author admits that the deposition of the low-\ngrade metasedimentary sequence may express, locally,\nthe global extensive phase that displaced the Archaean\nlithospheric plates and permitted the confined deposition\nof the metasedimentary sequences here analysed.\nConcluding, these sequences, affected by successive\ntectono-metamorphic episodes, are designated generi-\ncally in Angola as the Lower Metamorphic Group of\nLunda, and distinguished from the Basal Complex. They\nmay be the expression, in the interior of the Congo Craton,\nof the tectono-metamorphic episode, accompanied by\nintense granitization, that developed to the west of the\ncraton and, also, in the surroundings of the Tanzania\nCraton , being the equivalent to the more vast Ubendian-\nEburnean cycle (2.0 \u00b1 0.2 Ga) . The syn-tectonic porph y-\nritic granites of Lunda may belong to the same cycle.\n\nIn the Cambulo-Cassanguidi region, on both margins\nof the Luembe River, outcrops the most complete\nsequence of the Upper Metamorphic Group of Lunda\n(CARVALHO, 1984), previously named \"Metamorphic\nSeries of NE Angola\" (RODRIGUES &amp; PEREIRA, 1973;\nMONFORTE, 1988). The present group includes two series ,\na lower and an upper, each of which consists of three\nformations . Thus, the lower series consists of: A 1a - gneis-\nses and amphibolitic schists, quartz-feldspathic schists and\nphyllites, carbonaceous schists and phyllites; Alb - fine-\ngrained quartzites; Al c - purple, red or grey schists and\nphyllites. The upper series is discordant over the lower\nseries and consists of: A2a - phyllites and sandy schists\nwith intercalations of conglomerates; A2b - phyllites,\ntalc-schists and quartz-phyllites; A2c - local silicified\nlimestones. These rocks were folded and schistosed in a\nmain deformational event with NE-SW to NNE-SSW\ndirection, although later fragile folding and kinks with\nNNW-SSE and WNW-ESE directions are observable.\n\n. From the earlier works on Lunda (ANDRADE, 1953a;\nMONFORTE, 1960) resulted a tendency to associate the\nUpper Metamorphic Group of Lunda to the Kibarian\ncycle , designating it \"Kibaras System\". Geological\n\nmapping by RODRIGUES &amp; PEREIRA (1973) raised suspi-\ncion that there were two distinct groups, the lowest being\nthe oldest. On the other hand , the classical works ,\nalthough including the sequence in the Kibarian cycle,\nalways matched it to the Lulua Group (POLINARD, 1934;\nFIEREMANS , 1958; DELHAL, 1973), that is now considered\nolder than previously admitted (ANDRE, 1993). In the\nsame sequence, basic (doleritic and gabbro-dioritic)\nintrusions with K/Ar isotopic ages of 1320 \u00b1 36 Ma and\n1490 \u00b1 40 Ma (CARVALHO et al., 1983) strengthen this\nhypothesis. According to these authors, these ages may\ncorrespond to an Ar loss during the Kibarian cycle and\nthe rocks would therefore correspond to the Eburnean\n(CAHEN et al., 1984).\n\nPan-African Cycle\n\nRegarding the sedimentogenesis of the Pan-African\ncycle (KRONER &amp; CORREI A, 1980; BLACK, 1984;\nPORADA, 1989), in Lunda there are only the outcrops of\nthe Saurimo region , on the Chicapa River, to the south;\nthe ensemble Luangando-Luana, on the Luachimo and\nLuana rivers; and those of the Cassanguidi region , on the\nCartuchi-Camaungo streams, tributaries of the Luembe\nRiver, to the north. They allowed to define: the Luana\nFormation, composed of conglomerates, salmon-colou-\nred quartzites, immature red sandstones, phyllites and red\nor black schists; and the Cartuchi-Camaungo Formation,\nalso consisting from the base to top of conglomerates,\ngreywackes, quartzites , ferruginous feldspathic sand-\nstones and schists with purple colour. Both units are\nperfectly equivalent to each other, exhibit low-grade\nmetamorphism and preserve primary structures such as\ngraded bedding and cross-stratification, which indicate\nshallow platform deposition. They were preserved in\nextensive grabens with WSW-ENE general orientation\nand, more rarely, NE-SW orientation. The deformation is\ninsignificant without the development of schistosity that\nonly becomes penetrative in the pelitic layers.\n\nBased on the analysis of the lithostratigraphic\nsequence, these units may be considered equivalent to\nthe Xisto-Gresoso Group of the W Congo Super-Group\n(SCHERM ERHORN, 1981). The age of the Luana Formation\nwas temporarily considered by ANDRADE (1953a) as post-\n\" Metamorphic Series of NE Angola\" and pre-Karroo,\nconcerning the fact that the clasts present in the Luana\nconglomerate revealed fine-grained quartzites, typical of\nthose series, and also, due to the fact that the Lower\nKarroo tillite (Lutoe Group) contains fragments of\nquartzites and schists of the Luana Formation.\n\n\n\nCongo Basin\n\nPre-Atlantic evolution\n\nThe Congo Basin (VEATCH, 1935) has its origin in\nGondwana's interior. This basin is surrounded by the\nFrancevillien, Sembien, Liki-Bembe and Urundi-Kiba-\nrien mobile belts from the Kibarian orogenic cycle\n(1 .2 \u00b1 0.2 Ga), and by the West Congolian, Oubangui-Lin-\ndien, Bushimaien and Katangien mobile belts from the\nPan-African orogenic cycle (850 - 450 Ma). Posterior to\nthe last deformational phase of this latter cycle, the basin\nadmits little deposition in the middle Ordovician with a\nsandy marine transgressive sequence overlain by pelagic\nmud sediments and, at the top, by arkoses (Banalia\nArkoses) that prograde in the basin from the E and W.\nThe age of these arkosic sandstones is essentially\nSilurian-Devonian (DALY et al., 1992).\n\n195\n\nSince this period, the depositional situation changed\nremarkably and the Congo Basin becomes a strongly\nsubsiding area, due to the large-scale extensive tectonics ,\ninduced by distant continental collisions, such as the\ncollision of Laurentia-Baltica with Gondwana in the\nDevonian-Carboniferous and the collision of Patagonia\nwith the Gondwana in the Triassic. The completely conti-\nnental sedimentological evolution and the endorheic\ndrainage originated a thick sedimentary sequence, which\nin some sections attained approximately 9 km in thick-\nness (DALY et al., 1992).\n\nDuring the Carboniferous and Permian the cratonicbase-\nment was covered by the continental terrigenous sequences\nof the Karroo and Continental Intercalar Group. In the\nparticular case of Angola, and in the diamondiferous area\nof the Lunda province , it is possib le to find some frag-\nments of a glacio-fluvial and lacustrine-deltaic sequences,\ncorrelated with the Karroo (LEPERSONNE, 1951), preserved\nin tectonic fault-bounded structures (Table 2).

The important work\n\nma de by REAL (1959) gave a decisive contribution to the\n\nknowledge of those continental units and, particularly, to\nthe definition of the ango lan Karroo deposits . In the\n\nestablished lithostratigraphic column, he does not\n\ninclude , however, an y sequence that may be correlated to\nthe old Lualaba Seri es (old designation for the set of\n\nStanleyville and Loia Groups).\nIn the Congo Democratic Republic (former Zaire),\n\ndrilling work s allow the definition of the Stanleyville, Loia\n\nand Bokungu Groups (CAHEN et al. , 1960 ; CAHEN, 1981 ;\n1983) . La ter, DALY et al. (1991) proposed the strati-\ngraphic rank of Formation to those units, with the mainte-\nnance of the unit names (Table 3). In the Kassai region,\nthe Loia Group overlies the Stanleyville Group by a very\nlow angle unconformity. The Bokungu Group overlies both\nby an unconformity (CAHEN, 1983). The chronostratigra-\nphy of those units are based on Phyllopodes biozones,\nwhich allow the redefin ition of the Lualaba Series.\n\nWe think that, in Angola, man y of the continental\nterrigenous deposits included in th e Cas sange III\n(MOUTA, 1954) or included in the \"Camadas com\nFilopodes\" of several authors that have worked in the\n\nCassange or Lu nda regions, cou ld and must be revised,\n\nsimilarly to what happened in the Congo Central Basin.\nThere is a lack of detail ed stratigraphic and bio strati-\n\ngraphic work, refinement of tectonic interpretation and ,\n\nfinall y, formal definition of stratigraphic units.\n\nThe Continental Int ercalar Group outcrops in exten -\n\nsive areas of the Cassange reg ion . In Lunda, it can also\n\nbe seen in several localities along the Chicapa, Luachimo\n\nand Lovua Rivers, rang ing several ten s of meters (REAL,\n\nTABLE 3\n\nContinental terrigenous units of Congo Basin (Pos-Karroo and Pre-Kalahari)\n\nGROUP\nSEDIMENTOLOGY\n\nAGE and TECTONICS\n\nCONGO ANGOLA ANGOLA\nDEMOCRATIC (Baixa de Cassange) (Lunda)\n\nREPUBLIC\n\nFLUVIO-LAC USTRINE\nCENOMANIAN KWANGO KWANGO KWANGO\n\n(CALONDA-Fm) (CALONDA Fm)\nTORRENTIAL\n\n[IJ UPPER ALBIAN BOKUNGU KIMBERLITIC\n;:l INTRUSIONS0\nfol UNCONFORMITY\nU\n\n~\nFLUVIO-LACUSTRINEfol CONTINENTAL CONTINENTA L\n\n~\nU INTERCALAR INTERCALAR\n\nLOWER ALBIAN\nLOlA\n\nREGIONAL HIATUS\nAPTIAN\n\nU STANLEYVILLE CASSANGE LACUSTRINE<ii\n[IJ MALM UNDIFERENTIATED\n~\n;:l WoE EXTENSION..,\n\n\n\n1959; MONFORTE, 1988). Despite the referred ambiguity,\n\nthe units sequence, observable on the left margin of the\nCassamba River - east margin tributary of Chicapa River\nnear Calonda village - are, from base to top (PEREIRA et\nal., 2000b) (Table 3):\n\n\u2022 Sandy mudstones with conglomerates, breccias and\nred claystones with alternating layers of whitish\nand reddish sandstones (= 10 m) ;\n\n\u2022 White kaolinised arkoses and red sandstones with\nlevels of brown mudstones (= 6 m);\n\n\u2022 Reddish clays and sands with microconglomeratic\nintercalations (= 4 m).\n\nThese sequences and the respective basement were\nstrongly segmented by extensive tectonics , coeval with the\nopening of the South Atlantic . Several fault-bounded struc-\ntures (grabens and semi -grabens) trending mostly\nWSW-ENE and NNW-SSE were originated, which\npreserve the pre-Cretaceous sediments. These structural\nalignments, mostly inferred from the occurrence of the\n\nKarroo and Continental1ntercalar deposits, have extreme\nimportance for they favour kimberlite emplacement and,\nconsequently, are excellent guides for kimberlite explo-\nration.\n\nSeveral of these and other main structural lineaments\nand structures correspond to inherited structures from\nprevious tectonic episodes.\n\nCongo Craton pre-Atlantic deformation\n\nInevitably, the Congo Craton exhibits the main struc-\ntural trends that characterized the orogenic cycles referred\nto before : WSW-ENE directions from the Archaean; NW-\nSE trend from the Eburnean structures and N-S to NNW-\nSSE directions from the Pan-African cycle . These are the\ndirections of the tectonic flow, which imply specific\ntension fields for each cycle that will not be mentioned\nhere. Due to the rigid rheology of the main cratonized\nblocks intervening in the Pan-African cycle, the fragile\nstructures of this cycle play an important role in the frag-\nmentation of the Congo Craton . It will be reactivated in the\ntectonic episodes acting over the Gondwana, after\nCambrian times , which culminate with the opening of the\nsouth Atlantic. Amongst these episodes it is worth empha-\n\nsizing the continental collisions that occurred in the\nDevonian-Carboniferous and in the Triassic.\n\n197\n\nThe main inherited structures and fractures (COWARD\n\n&amp; DALY, 1984) are represented in Fig. 2. It is with the\nanalyses of the reactivation of the fractures that the\ncontrol of the kimberlite emplacement is made.\n\ni) - Inherited structures\n\nThe oldest structures and, certainly, those of major\nimportance in the structural control of kimberlite\ndiamond sources, and consequently in the distribution of\nsecondary deposits, are those that define the WSW-ENE\ndirection of the Lucapa Graben (DELVILLE , 1961 ;\nMONFORTE, 1970). However, this structure is not\nconfined to the Lunda area , and extends from the mouth\nof the Cuanza River, in Angola, to the Kassai, in the\nCongo Republic (WASILEWSKY, 1950). The age of this\nstructure is, at least, related to the Pan-African Cycle, but\ncould be older than this, because the Charnockitic\nComplex and the Dybaia Group (= 2.9 \u00b1 0.2 Ga) are\npreserved inside the Lucapa Graben. During the Pan-\nAfrican, the tension field responsible for the W Congo\nand Damara mobile belts, implies a maximum tension\norientated WSW-ENE. These forces must have produced\nextension movements in the Lucapa Graben, that lead to\nthe preservation of the Charnockitic Complex and , also,\nthe Luana / Cartuchi-Camaungo Formation.\n\nii) - Consequences of the Laurentia-Baltica collision\nwith the Gondwana during the Devonian-Carboniferous\n\nThis collisional process originated the Variscan chain ,\nessentially developed in central and west Europe, and\nalso the Appalachian chain and the Morocco-Mauritania\nAtlas Mountains, evolving, respectively, the eastern part\nof North America and the northern part of Africa.\n\nIn present-day geography, the placement of the Afri-\ncan Hercynian chains, with dominant W-E to ENE-WSW\nstructural trends for the major structures, implies a maxi-\nmum compression with a NNW-SSE direction. As a\nconsequence of continental uplift, foreland basins or\nsimple continental depressions are formed in the\norogenic front. Examples of this situation are the epicon-\ntinental basins that occupy the whole northern part of\nAfrica, namely, the Tindouf, Algeria and Taoudeni basins\n(CAPUTO &amp; CROWELL, 1985).\n\nIt is plausible that those NNW-SSE tensions could have\nsome consequences on the Congo Basin, reactivating the\ninherited Pan-African structures as tensile fractures\nalong the main faults with that direction. In fact , the\noccurrence of the tillites and fluvio-glacial deposits of\n\n\n\n198\n\n~-- 00 I\n(\n\n200S\n\n30\u00b0 S\n\no 500 Km\nI E3 E3 I\n\n10\u00b0 E 30\u00b0 E\n\nLEGEND:\n\n, y/ FAULT\n/ (WITH SHEAR SENSE )\n\n\\ PAN AFRICAN\n'1 THRUST\n\nPAN AFR ICAN\nFOLD BELTS\n\n40\u00b0 E\n\nFig . 2 - Main cratonic blocks in South ern Africa. Basement fractures: I - Damba structure; 2 - Cuanza-Kassai structure; 3 - Mwembeshi structure.\n\nthe Lutoe Group, outcropping along the Chicapa River in\nLunda, are preserved in fault-bounded structures with\nNNW-SSE directions.\n\nOn the other hand, faults with NW-SE and NNE-SSE\ndirections could be reactivated with wrench movements,\nwhile the WSW-ENE faults act as compression structures.\n\niii) - Consequences of the Patagonia - Gondwana\ncollision in the Triassic\n\nThis collisional event originated the Cape Town\norogen with a WNW-ESE structural trend (DALY et al.,\n1991), and also had consequences on the Congo Basin.\n\nIn fact, in the southern limit of the basin, in the Angolan\nterritory within the basin, several structures could be\nseen and are perhaps more important than those formerly\ndescribed (REAL, 1959).\n\nThe most recent of these structures, with NNE-SSW\ndirection and which exert a tectonic control over the\nCassange Group of Permian-Triassic age, could be inter-\npreted as tensile fractures related with the distal\nPatagonia-Gondwana collision.\n\nSubordinate to the present tension field, the NNW-SSE\nand WSW-ENE fractures, may still be activated as\nwrench faults, dextral and sinistral, respectively.\n\n\n\nThe Triassic age for this reactivation followed by a\nreverse sense extension, near the W-E direction, preser-\nves the Cassange Group deposits, and favours the ascent\nof magmatism and volcanism of the upper Karroo, and\ncontrols the Mesozoic sedimentogenesis. These struc-\ntures are also fundamental for the control of kimberlite\nemplacement that mainly affects along the NNW-SSE\nand WSW-ENE conjugated directions (MONFORTE, 1970;\nREIS, 1972).\n\nThus , continental rifting begins in the Jurassic . The\nCongo Basin is under confined traction, crustal rupture\nand continental tholeiitic magmatism and volcanism\noccurs and sedimentation is interrupted. The opening of\nthe northern Atlantic is coeval with these geological\nevents. The continental rifting in the south Atlantic and in\nAngola begins in the Cretaceous, pre-Aptian (BROGNON\n&amp; VERRI ER, 1965; PEREIRA, 1971).\n\nIn the Albian , the opening of the south Atlantic\ncontinues and sedimentation of the Continental Intercalar\nGroup occurs simultaneously. After the Albian, in the\npassive Atlantic margin, and particularly in the Cuanza\nBasin , alkaline and hyperalkaline intrusions and lava\nflows (PEREIRA, 1969; PEREIRA &amp; MOREIRA, 1978) are\nfound intercalated in the sedimentary units. These are\nreliably dated by post-Albian and possibly Cenomanian\nfossil fauna (LAPAO &amp; GALVAO, 1971). In the same\nperiod, in the Congo basin, kimberlite and carbonatite\nvolcanic activity starts, associated with the \"volcanic belt\nof Angola\" (MACHADO, 1959). This age is corroborated\nby Rb/Sr radiometric dating in several places in Angola,\nsuch as 87 \u00b1 11 Ma, in phonolites (SILVA, 1973) and 92 \u00b1 7\nMa, in tinguaites from the carbonatite ring structure of\nCatanda (SILVA &amp; PEREIRA, 1971).\n\nSubsequently to this period of strong tectono-\nvolcanic and sedimentary activity at the end of the\nCretaceous, followed a strong cycle of erosion during\nwhich the regional relief was eroded and the region was\ncovered by thick sedimentary mud-sand-conglomerate\nsequences of the Kwango and Kalahari Groups. As a\nresult, only the erosional activity of the present drainage\npattern allows the crystalline basement, the alkaline and\nkimberlite volcanic structures, and also the first sedi-\nmentary collector of diamonds, the Calonda Formation,\nto outcrop (Table 3).\n\nKimberlite / Lamproite emplacement in Angola\n\nThe emplacement ages ofthe kimberlites in the world\nare well known (KIRKLEY et al., 1992; FIPKE et al. , 1995;\nGURN EY, 1989; MEYER, 1985; 1987) with three Precam-\n\n199\n\nbrian ages, a succession of Palaeozoic ages and several\nMeso-Cenozoic ages with a main Cretaceous period of\nemplacement. On the other hand, the isotopic ages\nobtained from diamond inclusions clearly reveal that\nthe diamond ages are generally comprised between\n3300-990 Ma . In some cases those ages are much\nolder than the kimberlites that transport the diamond\nup to the surface, with ages more frequently between\n100-90 Ma (RICHARDSON et al., 1984; RICHARDSON et\nal ., 1990).\n\nIt is possible to synthesise the consequences of the\ndifference between the ages of the diamonds and the ages\nof their transport to the surface: i) the diamond is origi-\nnated and stored in the mantle during long periods of\ntime; ii) it is transported to the surface in specific periods\n(inter-orogenic) of Earth's history; iii) diamonds of\ndifferent ages occur in the same pipe, as in the case of the\nFinch mine (RICHARDSON et al., 1990), which implicates\nthe existence of several mantle sources crossed by the\nsame kimberlite during ascencion ; iv) and , finally, the\ndiamonds are not genetically related with the kimberlites,\nthat serve only as a transportation medium up to the\nsurface. The diamond sampling in the mantle is done by\na mechanism of geothermal gradients and thermody-\nnamic conditions for diamond stability (KENNEDY &amp;\nKENNEDY, 1976; HAGGERTY, 1986).\n\nIn the distribution map of kimberlites and alkaline\nring structures in Angola (Fig. 3), it is possible to see the\nseven kimberlite provinces that are presently known\n(REIS, 1972; REIS &amp; BARROS, 1981).\n\nThe four most important of those provinces are:\nLunda (I) ; Cucumbi, Cacuilo and Cuango Rivers region\n(II); Cuanza Basin (Ill) and the Cunene, Queve and\nCatumbela River springs region (IV). These provinces\nare aligned along one NE-SW macrostructure\n( L u n d a - Walvis Bay lineament or Volcanic Belt of\nAngola). The Lunda province is controlled by fault-\nbounded compartments with WSW-ENE direction in\nan echelon pattern, dislocated by NNW-SSE faults .\nThe other three main provinces (II, III and IV) are\ntectonically controlled by NE-SW and NW-SE frac-\ntures.\n\nThe remaining provinces: Longa River springs (V),\nCassinga region (VI) and Cubango River springs (Vll) ,\nare tectonically controlled by NW-SE fractures . Together\nwith provinces III and IV, they form a structural linea-\nment with this same orientation.\n\nIn the crossing of these two systems of major frac-\ntures several kimberlite pipes were found using airborne\n\n\n\n200\n\nATLANTIC\nOCEAN\n\nNGIVA\n@\n\nNAMIBIA\n\nLEGEND:\n@ Village\n\nD Dlamondlterous placers\nand conglomerates\n\no Kirnberlites\n\n/\n\nZAMBIA\n\n/ , MAV~~,0~ ~:'!; i\n\ny .~ --\nCUb8~no .\n~ \" ....\"....\"..\" .. \u00b7'\u00b7\u00b7 0 50 1001S0 200km._.-\",\n\nFig. 3 - Occurrence map ofkimberlites, alluvial deposits and ring alkaline structures (Kimberlitic Provinces of Angola), after (RBIS, 1972).\n\nmagnetic surveys (REIs, 1971). The Atlantic traction\nforces cause the formation of graben-type structures that\nwere formerly described, that control and preserve the\nsecondary deposits of diamonds: Kwango Group, river\nterraces and present alluvial deposits.\n\nFrom the exposed, we emphasise the strong structural\ncontrol for the kimberlite emplacement. The main weak-\nness fracture zones where the kimberlites are found were\ninherited from Precambrian orogens and from the tensile\nfracture systems actuating in the Congo craton between\n\nthe Carboniferous-Permian and the Cretaceous (PEREIRA\net al., 2000a).\n\nIn Lunda, there are several petrographic facies of kim-\nberlite: porphyritic type, breccias and tuff-breccias. The\nmode of occurrence ofkimberlites is mainly in diatremes\nor pipes, but dikes and sills are also known. The pipes are\nelliptical or circular, irregular, with variable dimension\nand are generally small in size. However, the Catoca,\nCamafuca-Camazambo, Camutue, Camatchia-Camagico\npipes form the exception in this area as these are much\n\n\n\nlarg er in size ; uneroded and consist of groups of\ndiatremes. Their composite nature gives them the larger\ndimension. The dikes and sills are thin find can attain\nlengths up to one hundred meters , showing a porphyritic\nstructure and few xenoliths. Generally these are relat ed\nwith fracture lineaments or have a radial disposition in\nrelation to the larger pipes , as in the case of Camutue,\n\nAs far as we know there is no isotopic data on kim-\nberlit es from Ang ola . The kimberlites are prob ably post-\nPaleo zoic since in the Chicapa River, the Camafuca-Cama-\nzambo kimberl ite , the Karroo and the Continental\nInterc alar depo sits are cros s cut by the diatreme (REAL,\n1959). We therefore presume that the Lunda kimberlites\nand, in general, the Angolan kimberlites are emplaced in\nthe Cretaceous period with the opening of the South\nAtlantic.\n\nFurther age indication comes from the relat ion of the\nkimberlite occurrences within the \"Volcanic Belt of\nAngola\", a major structure in Angolan geology, which\nplays an important role in the kimberlite magmatism.\n\nThe \"Hotspot\"/ \"Thinspot\" of Walvis Bay - Rio\nGrande do Sui , has been known for a long time as the\n\"Volcanic Belt of Angola\" (MACHADO, 1959; EDWARDS,\n1971; CORREIA, 1988). The evolution of this hot spot is\nrefle cted in the strong differentiation that can be seen\nalong the Volcanic Belt from NE to Sw. In the north-\neastern kimberlite provinces, there are rich exploitable\nkimberlites in Lunda (I) and in Bakwanga (Congo\nDemocratic Republic) (WASILEWSKY, 1950); poor kimber-\nlites with diamond and pyrope in Cucumbi, Cacuilo and\nCuango (II); kimberlites with pyrope and subordinate\ndiamond in the Cuanza basin (III); practically sterile\nkimberlites in the Cunene; Queve and Catumbela River\nsprings (IV) ; and, finally , concentric structures with\nnepheline syenites and carbonatites in the south-western\npart of the Lunda - Walvis Bay lineament, such as:\nZen za , Nonga, Elonga, Balombo, Longojo , Bonga,\nTchivira , Serra da Neve, Virulundo (LOUREIRO, 1967).\nThese occurrences seem to confirm MILASHEV (1965) and\nBARDET (1973-1977) ideas. The variation in geothermal\ngradient from the centre to the external part of the craton\nand the fraction ation of the alkaline magma, associated\nwith the conditions of diamond stability w ith the phase\ntransformation of diamond in graphite , is totally\nconfirmed in space and time in Ang ola (Fig. 3).\n\nThere is a question related with the time of this\nmagma evolution between the Lunda and the Namibe\nregion (PEREIRA, 1969). An Albian age (110 Ma) is\nadmitted for the Lunda kimberlite intrusions while the\n\n201\n\nalkaline magmatism of Walvis Bay is of Cenom a-\nnian- Turonian age. If we consider an expansion rate of\n10 ern/year for the South Atlantic and/or equal velocity in\nthe NE movement of the African Plate , the distance of\nappro ximately 2000 km between Lunda and Walvis Bay\nis overcome in 10 Ma. The se numbers point out the\nvalidity of the hypothesis of an enormous magmatic\ndiapir in expansion that must establish the control of the\ndiamond in Ang ola.\n\nA ll these geological episodes are related to the open-\ning of the Atlantic. In fact the breaking up of Pangea and\nthe opening of the Atlantic caused intens e fracturing in\nthe African continent, with a triple joint near Lake Chad\nand three radial megastructures: one in the direction of\nTunis , another till the Fernando PO islands and the third ,\nmore irregular, that pa sses through Mombassa (Fig. 4a ).\nThis megafracturing originated three more or less\ncratonic megablocks: Occ idental (0. B.); Ar abian-Nubic\n(A. N . B.) and Austral (A. B.). In the Neocomian-Aptian\noccurred the separation between the Arabian-Nubian and\nAustral blocks , causing a left wrench movement in the\nChad- Tunis structure; in the upper Aptian-lower\nAlbian , by NE-SW extension, the separation between the\nOccidental and the Arabic-Nubi an block s occur s, imply-\ning the development of the dextral transform fault that\nseparates the Occidental and Arabian-Nubic blocks from\nthe Austral block (Fig. 4b) (FAIRHEAD, 1988; UNTERNEHR\netal. , 1988; GIRA UD &amp; MAURIN, 1991).\n\nSince the Albian , the Atlantic opening process induces\nintensive W-E tensile activity in the Austral crustal block\n(MARTIN, 1973; OJEDA, 1982; REYRE, 1984), which, in\ntum , is also divided in at least three other crustal cratonic\nblocks: Congo , Tanzania and Kalahari (Fig. 2). The Congo\nand Tanzania cratonic blocks are also separated from the\nKalahari craton by the Mwembeshi left transform fault,\nparticularly active in Pan-African times and responsible\nfor the formation of the Damara belt (KRONER, 1982), and\nthe Lufilian Arc (COWARD &amp; DALY, 1984). The tensile\nforces reactivate weakness zone s inherited from the\nPrecambrian orogenic cycles and from the continental\ncollisions with Gondwana, formerly referred.\n\nConcerning the Congo craton, and in the specific case\nof Angola, the main weakness zones defined are: WSW-\nEN E, NW-SE and NN E-SSW. Under the W-E tensile\nforces , coeval with the Atlantic opening, the WSW-ENE\nfractures will react mainly with wrench movements ,\nwhile the other become mainly tensile.\n\nConsidering all these facts and models it is worth\nemphasising some ideas about the most successful method s\n\n\n\n202\n\nTUNIS\n-----~\n\nLj)\n1JA.

In view\nof the previous ideas and assumptions on the major\ngeological controls of kimberlite emplacement, the most\nfavourable areas are those that have a cratonic basement,\nand alkaline volcanism associated with deep transcurrent\nor extensive tectonics. In Lunda, very thick post-kimber-\nlite terrigenous sediments, deep weathering profiles and\ndense vegetal cover obscure these geological conditions.\nThis inevitably leads to choosing geophysical methods of\nkimberlite exploration over other conventional methods.\n\nImportance ofairborne magnetic surveys\n\nThis method of exploration revealed itself very useful\nin the location of the major lineaments that control the\nascent and emplacement ofkimberlites. Thus, this method\nwas decisive to the discovery of volcanic alkaline struc-\ntures where those rocks are found. In fact, the crystalline\ncomplexes have, throughout geological time, been\n\nsubjected to different diastrophic phases that have modi-\nfied the physical properties ofthe various lithologicalunits .\nThese changes have been brought out by metasomatic\nphenomena and magmatic differentiation process (RBIS,\n1966). On the other hand, the basic and ultrabasic comple-\nxes, as shown by their circular alkaline-carbonatite struc-\ntures, have had a history of tectonic control along the main\nlines of structural weakness, together with magmatic dif-\nferentiation (RBIS, 1971; RBIS &amp; BARROS, 1981; REfS &amp;\nMONFORTE, 1981).\n\nThe main suite of volcanic rocks consist predomi-\nnantly of andesitic laves, rhyolites and gabbros which\nare related to the alkaline complexes and the nepheline\nsyenites, ijolites, trachytes, phonolites, breccias, tuffs,\ncarbonatites and kimberlites. The carbonatites and\nkimberlites associations under similar tectonic condi-\ntions has been discussed by several authors (DAWSON,\n1980; BARDET, 1973; NIXON, 1987; KORNPROBST,\n1984).\n\n\n\n203\n\nA good example of the aeromagnetic application for\nkimberlite detection is shown in Fig. 5, which gives a\nzoom sketch map from the Uambo region, in central\nAngola.\n\nThe structural map shows all the geological and\ngeophysical data and delimits the three main WSW-ENE,\nNW-SE and NE-SW fault systems.

The thick continental sequence\n..<::\n'\" originated comprises all the diamondiferous sedimentaryc:0\n.~\n\nunits: Kwango Group, Kalahari Group and recent allu-0)\nP::: vial deposits. Thus, knowledge of this succession of\nI\n\n0 0 0 0 \\0 geologic events is fundamental for diamond exploration\n0 0 0 0 .;:P0- co r-, -0\n\n~ in Angola (Fig. 6).\n\n\n\nKwango Group - Calonda Formation\n\nThe Calonda Formation (CF) is considered the first\nsedimentary collector of diamonds , and is correlative with\nthe continental diastrophism and supergenic destruction of\nkimberlite diamond sources. As a consequence, the CF\ncolIects the products of surface destruction of kimberlites\nand lamproites (D ELVILLE, 1973; RODRIGUES, 1993).\n\nThe Calonda Fm sedimentogenesis is, thus, con-\ntrolIed by the filling-up of fault-bounded large depres-\nsions that originated by extensional tectonics coeval with\nthe opening of the South Atlantic (REIS et al. , 2000).\n\nThe Calonda stratigraphic sequence is composed\nmainly of torrential deposits, correlated and proximal to\nthe elevations, that express high energy and transport\ncapacity in a dense and viscous medium, where angular\ncoarse and fine clasts are transported by a dense argilla-\nceous mass , in water suspension. It show stages of great\nrecurrence, with conglomeratic and argilIaceous interca-\nlations, as the relief becomes less pronounced. Gradually,\nthe sedimentogenesis gains lagoonal characteristics\ndownstream, as a result of the grouping and coalescence\nof weak currents coming from lower lands.\n\nIn a mature stage of pediplanation, in the Upper\nCretaceous, this type of deposit implies an abundance of\nregolith and a great rainfall volume, as was interpreted\nfrom the textural maturity ofthe arenaceous sequences and\nfrom the sedimentary structures, namely cross-bedding.\n\nAt the top of the CF sequence, the limonitic, silcrete\nand calcrete levels , indicates the larger frequency of dry\nseasons and the complete disappearance of surface\nwaters. Generally, the sedimentological column ends\nwith terrigenous sandy-argillaceous materials with sparse\nangular pebbles. These uppermost levels correspond to a\nlow energy laminar flow transport with aeolian transport\nepisodes. .\n\nThe Calonda Formation was informally defined in\nLunda (NE Angola) (ANDRADE, 1953a, b; 1954). In the\nDemocratic Republic of Congo, together with other\nlithostratigraphic units , it is placed in the frame of the\nCongo Basin and it has been included in the Kwango\nGroup (MONFORTE et al ., 1979; CAHEN, 1983), with an\nage considered as Cenomanian, on the basis of fish\nmacrofossils and palynomorphs. In the latter years of the\nDIAMANG mining activities, several detailed studies\nwere carried out from a lithostratigraphic and economic\npoint of view (SARAIVA, 1973).\n\nThe Calonda Fm lithostratigraphy, with an average\nthickness of about 40-60 meters , is the base upwards:\n\n205\n\n\u2022 Coarse fanglomerate / conglomerate, with a sandy-\n-clay matrix showing several different sedimento-\nlogical types whose definition and classification\nwas proposed by several authors (e. g. FIEREMANS,\n1955; MONFORTE, 1960; SARAIVA, 1973) . In most\ncases the basal conglomerate produces diamonds\nand some attempts were made in order to relate the\nsedimentological type of each conglomerate with\nits diamond content.\n\n\u2022 Sequences of immature arenites with rare mudstone\nintercalations; the sandstones have cross stratifica-\ntion and several colours that vary from place to place :\nviolet coloured muddy arenites; white arkosic-kao-\nlinitic arenites and reddish limonitic arenites;\n\n\u2022 Fine-grained conglomerate recurrences, with an\nargillaceous matrix;\n\n\u2022 Argillaceous component increasing upwards with\nsandy-argillaceous levels with limonitic horizons,\nsilcretes and calcretes indicating dry periods.\n\n\u2022 Predominance of argillaceous and sandy-argilla-\nceous levels with brownish colours at the top of the\nsequence. Sometimes with dispersed pebbles.\n\nKalahari Group\n\nThe lithostratigraphy, sedimentology and tectonics of\nthe formations included in the Kalahari Group must be\nstudied in the light of the global climate changes that\noccurred during its sedimentation. In fact, the Kalahari\nsedimentogenesis is coeval with the main erosive periods\nthat have sculptured the relief, resulting in vast planes. It\nis the knowledge of the chronology of these planes\nsurfaces, coeval with depositional hiatus and together\nwith climatic changes that must be present in the study of\nthe Kalahari Group.\n\nThe formal definition of the units of the so-called\nKalahari System, was made in the Conference of Geo-\nlogists of the Congo Basin in 1945 (LEPERSONNE , 1945)\nand completed later by CAHEN et al. (1946) . These authors\nproposed three main divisions for the Kalahari , which\nresulted in the three formations considered until today :\n\n\u2022 Kalahari C (superieur) - Kalahari Sands\n\n\u2022 Kalahari B (intermedium) - \"Gres Polimorphyiques\"\n\n\u2022 Kalahari A (inferieur) - Kamina Formation\n\n\n\n206\n\nThe lower Kalahari is not present in Lunda or, what\nseems no probable, it is confused with the top of the\nCalonda Formation. This lack of definition could be due\nto the facies similarities when the conglomerate is not\npresent (MONFORTE, 1960).\n\nBased on the works of several authors (POLINARD,\nI 948a, b; MOUTA &amp; DARTEVELLE, 1952; JANMART, 1953;\nCARVALHO, 1955; GREKOFF, 1958; DE PLOEY et aI.,\n1968), it was possible to define a lithostratigraphy for the\nKalahari of Lunda :\n\n\u2022 Upper Series or Ochre Sands Formation, formed\nby gravel layers at the base with ochre sands and\nyellow sands at the top;\n\n\u2022 Lower Series or \"Ores Polimorfos\" Formation,\ncomposed, from base to top, of conglomerate,\npurple sandstones locally silicified, chalcedony and\nsandy chalcedony, silicified quartzitic sandstones,\nsilcretes (FERREIRA, 1958), and white or red friable\nsandstones.\n\nAn Eocene to Oligo-Miocene age has been consi-\ndered for the \"Gres Polimorfos\" Formation based on\nfossil findings , namely Ostracods, Gasteropods, and\noogonic fragments of Chara genera.\n\nFrom our personal experience in NE Lunda, the tran-\nsition between Calonda Fm and the Kalahari Group is\nmade by a sedimentological unconformity with a weak\nerosive event:\n\n- Wherever the contact is observable, it is moderately\nundulate;\n\n- There could be several contact lithologies: in the\nC. F. sandstones it is possible to find mudstone levels,\ncross-bedding, parallel bedding and the presence of\nfeldspar; in the \"Gres Polimorfos\", apart from the\nstrong silicification, these units do not include\nmudstones, the feldspars are not visible in hand spe-\ncimen and the bedding planes are not perceptible.\n\n- In the basal levels of the \"Gres Polimorfos\", there\nis occasionally a well-rounded gravel made up of\nclasts of quartz and quartzite with angular chal-\ncedony that contains scarce diamonds.\n\nPost-Pliocene diamondiferous alluvial-eluvial\ndeposits\n\nIn a study ofthese kinds of deposits , it is very impor-\ntant to consider the last planation event in the Congo\n\nBasin. This event is post the Ochre Sands Formation,\npartly coeval with the late Pliocene pediplanation and\ncuts the Miocene and the late Cretaceous peneplains.\nMost of the Angolan geomorphology is dominated by\nsuch planation surfaces , with a stepping succession of\nplanation surfaces from the interior of the country to the\ncoast. The surfaces are also present in the endorheic\nmorphology of the Congo Basin .\n\nThe Pliocene peneplain is, thus, the best reference\nsurface for the Quaternary eluvio-alluvial deposits, with\nor without diamonds. This surface covered by:\n\n\u2022 Very dispersed plateau gravels composed by fer-\nralite elements and clasts of \"Gres Polimorfos\";\nthese deposits express the last stage of planation\nonce the finer elements have been removed by the\nwind and the surface-waters;\n\n\u2022 Sands covering the former plateau gravels, some-\ntimes with several meters of thickness. These sands\noccur between altitudes of 800-900 m, and are of\naeolian origin, resulting from the redistribution of\nKalahari sands in an arid climate .\n\nThe maximum altitude of the Pliocene surface marks\nthe dividing line between the main Lunda rivers flowing\nnorthwards . This surface is cut by the sub-actual and\nactual river drainage, with the correspondent planation\nlevels. Some of these planation levels are marked by\nterrace deposits, some of which are economically impor-\ntant. MONFORTE (1988), based on previous studies\n(POLINARD, 1949; BREUIL &amp; JANMART, 1950; JANMART,\n1953), defined these erosion cycles for the Lunda region.\n\nAs mentioned previously, humid tropical climates are\nfavourable for intense alteration while sub-arid climates\ngenerate great masses of regolith. The quaternary\nclimate, in the region of the Congo Basin, of low lati-\ntudes, is characterised by an alternation of these condi-\ntions . Therefore, the development of placers and residual\ndeposits depends on the combination of tectonic move-\nments and climatic conditions (HALL et aI., 1985).\n\nTectonism takes place in the Holocene . In fact, a tilt\nmovement to the W, affecting a sector of the Congo\nBasin induced the drainage of the great African river to\nflow to the Atlantic. From this point on the sedimentation\nis definitely altered in the basin and it becomes no longer\nendorheic, the level base is lowered and the encasement\nof the great tributaries of the Congo River starts . Wide\nvalleys with flat floors are generated and rapidly the\nriverbed is excavated on the friable units of the, also\ndesignated, Central African Basin .\n\n\n\nRemobilised Calonda, Kalahari and plateau deposits\n\nThe active slope erosion, cutting the easily friable\nCalonda and Kalahari deposits , remobilise and deposits\nits materials directly over the sloping crystalline base-\nment or in various level terraces.\n\nFrequently, the ore grade diminishes, due to the intro-\nduction of large volumes of barren Kalahari sands and\ngravels. However, if the erosion is directed on the\nCalonda basal conglomerate, a fine deposit with rich ore\ngrades could be formed on top of the basement. In Fig. 6,\nthe fine layers originated economically important\ndiamondiferous deposits .\n\nUpper Terraces (40 to 20 m)\n\ni) - 40 meter terrac es\n\nIt contains non-rounded Kafuense industry, pre-\nChelles-Acheulense (JANMART, 1946a, b). Some doubts\npersist about the origin of these deposits (LEAKEY, 1948).\nIn fact, there is a mixture of angular and rounded clasts.\nThese materials could be slope degradation products , the\nrounded materials having come from the pre-Pliocene\nunits.\n\nii) - 20 meter terraces\n\nThey contain non-rounded Kafuense industry, pre-\nChelles-Acheulense (JANMART, 1946a, b).\n\nContrary to the former terraces , relative to which\ndoubts sub sist about the deposition process, these\ndeposits constitute layers with a thickness that could rise\nto three meters, and are undoubtedly deposited by rivers\nduring their erosion activity until the present level posi-\ntion.\n\nThese terraces are situated approximately 20 meters\nabove the present riverbed level, on top of the crystalline\nbasement and they are very common in NE Angola.\n\nTheir economical value is higher than that of the\n40 meter terraces.\n\nMain rivers low-level terraces (~ 10 m)\n\nThey contain Oldwense industry and some other\ntypes of Chellense and Chelles-Acheulense industry.\n\nBetweenthe high terraces and the low terraces depo-\nsition, an important time span occurred, during which\nimportant climate changes happened (MONFORTE, 1988).\n\n207\n\nThese changes originated an important ferralite level\nnamed \"Pleistocene Laterite I\", whose genesis was\nfavoured by the alternating succession and dominance of\nthe hot dry season over the rainy one.\n\nThese terraces, with a thickness between 0.30 and\n1.50 meters, rest on top of the crystalline basement or on\ntop of the referred laterite.\n\nMain rivers alluvial flat and riverbed deposits\n\nUnder this title are grouped several depositional\nevents in several studies (e.g. JANMART, 1946a; LEAKEY,\n1948; MONFORTE, 1988).\n\nThey are low altitude terraces, with ferralitic levels,\nchanges in depositional regime of the river courses,\nterrigenous intercalations due to the .emersion of the\ndeposits, etc., essential, without doubt, to the research on\nclimatology and lithostratigraphy of recent Quaternary\n(HALL et al., 1985). Any work in this domain may not do\nwithout this analysis .\n\nIn a mining perspective , all of these deposits are\nlocated on the river margins, alluvial flat and on the\npresent riverbed.\n\nEconomical situation analysis of Angolan\ndiamondiferous deposits\n\nThe preceding text is a synthesis of the main aspects\nrelated with a complex geological problem that is the\ndiamond deposits of Angola. We have made reference to\nsome scientific and technical matters that must be\nconsidered in the study of the genesis and location of\nprimary and secondary diamond sources . Below, the\neconomical consequences of this knowledge in view of\nfuture trends and possibilities for diamond exploration\nand exploitation in Angola is discussed .\n\ni) Diamondiferous potential\n\nWhen Angola became an independent country, on the\nlIth of November of 1975, the ore reserves in diamond\nwere considerable (65 x 106 carats) , and the exploitation\nrate reached 2.1 x 106 carats/year. These numbers show\nthe effectiveness of the DIAMANG mining and explo-\nration activities until the end of its work. The succeeding\nAngolan Diamond Mining Company (ENDlAMA) took\nlarge benefits of this heritage to the present-day, if we\ntake into account that no more intensive significant\n\n\n\n208\n\nexploration works have been carried out since 1975.\nDespite some rare exceptions the present-day mining\nworks are still based on the DIAMANG ore reserves.\nToday there is no information about new proven reserves\nand the depletion of re serves is poorly controlled because\nof smuggling.\n\nIn 1975 the known proved reserves are , by ore type:\n\n\u2022 Primary sources (kimberlites/lamproites) : \"\" 45 x 106\n\ncarats;\n\n\u2022 Sedimentary detrital deposits (recent alluvial-elu-\nvial gravels , and some area with Calonda Fm basal\ngravels): \"\" 20 x 106 carats.\n\nIn relation to these numbers , it is important to notice\nthat statistical studies carried out in several tens of years\nhave shown that the exploitation results are 22 % higher\nthan the one s of exploration. On the other hand, an\nincrease in 30-40 % of ore proved reserves must be\nconsid ered , because in almost all the defined mining\nblocks the exploitation continues beyond the limits of\nthese blocks with ore treatment plant ore grade control.\n\nThe estimation of probable diamond reserves, was in\n1975 :\n\n\u2022 Primary sources (kimberlites/lamproites?): \"\" 40 x 106\n\ncarat s;\n\n\u2022 Sedimentary detrital depo sits in recent allu vial-elu-\nvial gravels (undervalued reserves): \"\" 7,5 x 106 carats;\n\n\u2022 Calonda Fm basal gravels: \"\" 26 x 106 m3 (a total of\n10.4 x 106 carats is estimated), with an average ore\ngrade of 0.4 ctl m3 and 0.8 m for the conglomerate\nthickness with an overburden thickness of about\n30 -60 m.\n\nThe Calonda Fm basal conglomerate was investi-\ngated and sampled by drilling. In face of the ubiquitous\noccurrence of this lithostratigraphic horizon in Lunda, it\nis eas y to point out the huge potential of Calonda Fm as\na future diamond reserve . The need for an adequate\nexploration program is obvious (PEREIRA, 1996; RODRI-\nGUES et al., 2000a; RODRIGUES et al., 2000b).\n\nA ll of the previously referred data on the diamond\npotential was collected and known onl y due to the work\nand exp erience of the DIAMANG geologists and miners\nin several scientific areas such as : remote sensing,\ngeophysics, geochemistry, loaming mineralometry and\nalso biology (botany and termites) . Together, several\ntechniques developed in these scientific areas lead to the\n\ndiscovery of 383 kimberlites, between 1952 and 1973\n(176 in 1973). Besides these , 46 new kimberlites were\nfound by CONDIAMA(a DE BEERS and DIAMANG asso-\nciated Company), in a total of 429 identified kimberlites\nuntil July of 1973, which can be grouped in the following\nmanner: 2.8 % economically exploitable; 1.2 % under\nevaluation studies; 46.6 % without diamonds and 49.4 %\nnot studied.\n\nAt present time , a number about 600 kimberlite\nbodies were identified.\n\nii) Future perspectives\n\nAs a result of the generalised illegal miners all over\nthe country, the secondary diamond deposits related with\nthe actual river drainage does not represent an economic\nsource to the country, and, in our opinion, they are in the\nfuture completely lost for any kind of organised indus-\ntrial scale mining activity. In fact , since 1978 and with an\never increasing rate , since 1985 that those kinds of ille-\ngal mining activities have tak en place in those kind of\ndepo sits. The consequent inexi stenc e of effective control\non high-grade I little-overburden thickness and well-\nsized good-quality stones lead to a \" diamondiferous\"\nchaos in Angola.\n\nA s a result of these illegal acti vitie s, the benefits for\nthe country were none and even highl y negati ve, due to\nthe illegal diamond exportat ion to foreign international\nmarkets (Antwerp, Israel , USA , etc) , but also because the\ndiamonds serve as financial support for other activities.\n\nA few, but important alternatives are left for the\nsecondary deposits: i) the main river bed deposits, unex-\nploitable without adequate technical support; ii) in rela-\ntion to the referred lost reserves, an alternative could be\nthe establishment of an official buying system, with\nattractive prices, that could conteract the illegal diamond\nexportation.\n\nTherefore, the good use of the remaining economi-\ncally viable kimberlite and Calonda Fm diamond\nresources that , due to their specific geological charac-\nteristics, are untouchable by illicit miners , is imperative.\n\nIn relation to the Calonda Fm , the usually thick over-\nburden hinders the activities of illegal diamond pro spec-\ntors. There are three main regions of high economical\npotential (REIS et al., 2000): NE Lunda , Cuango drainage\nbasin, and particularly the middle course of the Cuando\nRiver, that allows the establishment of several economi-\ncal projects: i) Maludi region (NE Angola) with recog-\nnised basal gravels approximating 22 x 106 m-', with\n30\"'60 m of overburden thickness and extremely good\n\n\n\ngem-quality diamonds ; ii) Cuango River basin, between\nthe Luremo and Cuango villages, with well-known\nvalues of mineralisation and also good quality and size of\ndiamonds; iii) middle of the Cuando drainage basin as a\npotential area for the occurrence of the Calonda basal\ngravel, but in a state of incipient geological knowledge.\n\nIn relation to the primary sources - kimberlites and\nlamproites - we point out the main provinces of location\n(REIs, 1972), but it is possible that numerous others are yet\nunknown. This type of ore demands a vast and intensive\nexploration program aimed at initial area selection and later\nwith refined exploration methods on a case to case basis.\n\nOur opinion is that when the country become s\nsocially stabilized, enormous unknown diamondiferous\nresources will be reveal ed as a consequence of an\nadequate scientific and techni cal program in such a large\narea available for exploration.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors are very grateful to Zelia Pereira and\nPaulo Castro from IGM, for the informatic s support in\nthe preparation of this synthesis.
