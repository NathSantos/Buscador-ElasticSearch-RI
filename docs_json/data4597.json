Efici\u00eancia e \nestabilidade de nanopart\u00edculas de \u00f3xidos de alum\u00ednio e de ferro para adsorver \nars\u00eanio. Orientador: Jaime Wilson Vargas de Mello. Co-orientadores: Walter \nAnt\u00f4nio Pereira Abrah\u00e3o e Virg\u00ednia Sampaio Teixeira Ciminelli. \n\n \n\n \n\nA geoqu\u00edmica do ars\u00eanio e do ferro est\u00e3o intimamente correlacionadas, de modo \n\nque os m\u00e9todos de remo\u00e7\u00e3o de As da \u00e1gua s\u00e3o baseados na alta afinidade deste \n\nmetal\u00f3ide por nanominerias de oxihidr\u00f3xidos de ferro. No entanto, em ambientes \n\nan\u00f3xicos as bact\u00e9rias redutoras de ferro desempenham papel crucial na cat\u00e1lise de \n\ntransforma\u00e7\u00f5es redox que, em \u00faltima an\u00e1lise, controlam a mobilidade do As em \n\nambientes aqu\u00e1ticos. Nanominerias de Al s\u00e3o comuns em solos e sedimentos e tamb\u00e9m \n\napresentam grande afinidade por As. Al\u00e9m disso, sob condi\u00e7\u00f5es redutoras, o Al \u00e9 \n\nest\u00e1vel e sua presen\u00e7a na estrutura dos oxihidr\u00f3xidos de Fe aumenta a establidade destes \n\noxidos, conforme bem documentado na literatura. Desta maneira, a associa\u00e7\u00e3o da alta \n\nafinidade dos oxihidr\u00f3xidos de Fe por As com a estabilidade do Al sob condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nan\u00f3xicas pode ser uma alternativa vantajosa para a remo\u00e7\u00e3o de As da \u00e1gua. Neste \n\nestudo, a espectroscopia Raman foi utilizada para investigar a influ\u00eancia do alum\u00ednio \n\nestrutural nos modos vibracionais de goethitas e das fases formadas entre arsenato e os \n\ndiferentes oxihidr\u00f3xidos de Al e Fe, bem como o potencial destes nanominerais para \n\nadsor\u00e7\u00e3o de As. A estabilidade do As retido por oxihidr\u00f3xidos de Al e Fe sob condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nan\u00f3xicas, na presen\u00e7a da bacteria Shevanella putrefaciens e anions competidores, \n\nfosfato ou carbonato, tamb\u00e9m foi investigada. Hidr\u00f3xido de Al de baixa cristalinidade \n\n[Al(OH)3], gibisita (Gb), ferrihidrita 2 linhas (Fh), hematita (Hm), goethita (Gt) e tr\u00eas \n\ngoethitas com substitui\u00e7\u00e3o por alum\u00ednio (AlGt), contendo 13, 20 e 23 cml mol-1 de Al, \n\nforam sintetizados e caracterizados qu\u00edmica e fisicamente. Estes adsorventes sem e com \n\n\n\n xiii\n\narsenato foram caracterizados por difra\u00e7\u00e3o de raios-X, reflect\u00e2cia difusa e \n\nespectroscopia Raman. A cin\u00e9tica de adsor\u00e7\u00e3o em duas diferentes rela\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nsolido:solu\u00e7\u00e3o, 2,0 e 5,0 g L-1, e as isotermas de adsor\u00e7\u00e3o foram obtidas ap\u00f3s equilibrar \n\nas amostras com solu\u00e7\u00f5es de arsenato sob agita\u00e7\u00e3o constante. A adsor\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e1xima de \n\nAs(V) foi medida em diferentes valores de pH, variando de 3 at\u00e9 9. Os adsorventes \n\nforam incubados anaerobicamente, sob atmosfera de N2, e os sobrenadantes foram \n\nperiodicamente amostrados para avaliar as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de As sol\u00favel. A presen\u00e7a de \n\nalum\u00ednio estrutural aumentou a \u00e1rea superficial espec\u00edfica e a capacidade de adsor\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nAs da goethita. Os efeitos gerais da presen\u00e7a do Al estrutural foram diminuir a \n\ncristalinidade e deslocar as linhas espectrais da goethita. Tal desordem estrutural foi \n\nclaramente identificada por espectroscopia Raman e difra\u00e7\u00e3o de raios-X. As altera\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nnas frequ\u00eancias vibracionais e largura de bandas devido ao Al estrutural resultou em \n\nperdas e sobreposi\u00e7\u00e3o de muitas bandas ativas da goethita. Esses efeitos aumentaram \n\ncom o grau de substitui\u00e7\u00e3o. A t\u00e9cnica Raman tamb\u00e9m confirmou a ocorr\u00eancia de \n\nmagnetita na amostra de goethita com menor grau de substitui\u00e7\u00e3o, conforme \n\nidentificado por difra\u00e7\u00e3o de raios-X. Bandas vibracionais da liga\u00e7\u00f5es As-O foram \n\nobservadas em todos os espectros Raman, exceto para goethita n\u00e3o substitu\u00edda, \n\nprovavelmente devido ao seu menor carregamento de As. As posi\u00e7\u00f5es das bandas \n\nvibracionais As-O sugerem que o As(V) foi fortemente retido na superf\u00edcie dos minerais \n\ncomo complexos de esfera interna. A despeito do r\u00e1pido equil\u00edbrio, a aumento na \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de s\u00f3lido, limitou a efici\u00eancia e a velocidade da adsor\u00e7\u00e3o de As. A \n\nadsor\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e1xima de As(V) diminuiu na seguinte ordem: Al(OH)3 > Fh > AlGt13 > \n\nAlGt20 > AlGt23 > Gb > Hm > Gt. No entanto, calculando as capacidades de adsor\u00e7\u00e3o por \n\n\u00e1rea superficial, Gb, Gt e Hm mostraram valores mais altos. Isto sugere que os s\u00edtios \n\nreativos n\u00e3o foram completamente ocupados por arsenato em goethitas com substitui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\npor Al e oxihidr\u00f3xidos mal cristalisados. N\u00e3o foi observada rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre tamanho m\u00e9dio \n\ndas part\u00edculas e adsor\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e1xima. Isto sugere reagrega\u00e7\u00e3o das part\u00edculas durante a an\u00e1lise \n\nou imperfei\u00e7\u00f5es na superf\u00edcie das part\u00edculas com aumento de sua carga l\u00edquida, resultando \n\nem alta densidade de adsor\u00e7\u00e3o. O comportamento de todas as amostram foi fortemente \n\ndepente do pH e a adsor\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e1xima foi obtida em condi\u00e7\u00f5es levemente \u00e1cidas. De modo \n\ngeral os hidr\u00f3xidos de Al foram mais eficientes do que os de oxihidr\u00f3xidos de Fe para \n\nremover As(V) da \u00e1gua. A presen\u00e7a de alum\u00ednio estrutural aumentou consideravelmente a \n\nefici\u00eancia das goehitas, as quais se mostraram promissoras como adsorventes para \n\nremo\u00e7\u00e3o de ars\u00eanio de \u00e1guas contaminadas. Verificou-se que as c\u00e9lulas de S. putrefaciens \n\n\n\n xiv\n\nforam capazes de se ligar nas superficies minerais e utilizar os oxihidr\u00f3xidos de Fe, tanto \n\ncristalinos quanto mal cristalisados, como aceptores finais de el\u00e9trons, mobilizando \n\narsenio em solu\u00e7\u00e3o. Goethitas substituidas por Al apresentaram decrescimo na fra\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nferro sol\u00favel e As mobilizado com o aumento do Al estrutural. A rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre \u00e1rea \n\nsurperficial espec\u00edfica e dissolu\u00e7\u00e3o redutiva de Fe e As tamb\u00e9m foi afetada pelo aumento \n\ndo Al estrutural, conforme esperado. O fosfato e o carbonato afetaram a cin\u00e9tica de \n\nredu\u00e7\u00e3o do Fe devido \u00e0 precipita\u00e7\u00e3o do ferro em solu\u00e7\u00e3o como fases minerais \n\nmetaest\u00e1veis (por exemplo vivianita e siderita). Parece que fases minerais an\u00e1logas de \n\nfosfatos serviram como sumidouro para o ars\u00eanio, limitando sua mobiliza\u00e7\u00e3o. Fosfato \n\ncompetiu fortemente com o arsenato e sua efici\u00eancia parece ter sido governada pela \n\nnatureza da liga\u00e7\u00e3o entre o As e a surperf\u00edcie adsorvente. Uma maior fra\u00e7\u00e3o de As foi \n\ndessorvido por fosfato na gibbsita, seguida pelas goethitas substituidas por Al. Por outro \n\nlado, apenas a gibbsita mostrou quantidades significativas de arsenato deslocado por \n\ncarbonato. N\u00e3o obstante a baixa cristalinidade, o Al(OH)3 foi mais eficiente para reter \n\narsenato na sua superf\u00edcie seguido por ferrihidrita e hematita. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n xv\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\n \n\nSILVA, Juscimar, D.Sc., Universidade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa, June 2008. Effectiveness \nand stability of aluminium and iron oxides nanoparticles for arsenate \nadsorption. Adviser: Jaime Wilson Vargas de Mello. Co-advisers: Walter Ant\u00f4nio \nPereira Abrah\u00e3o and Virg\u00ednia Sampaio Teixeira Ciminelli. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe geochemical fates of arsenic and iron are closely correlated that methods of \n\narsenic removal from water are based on the high affinity of this metalloid with Fe \n\n(hydr)oxides nanominerals. Nevertheless, in anoxic environment dissimilatory iron \n\nreducing bacteria play a fundamental role in catalysing the redox transformations that \n\nultimately control the mobility of As in aquatic environment. Aluminium nanominerals \n\nare ubiquitous and also have great affinity for arsenic. Additionally, under reducing \n\nconditions, Al is rather stable and its presence in the Fe (hydr)oxides framework \n\nenhance their stability, as well reported in the literature. Thus, by associating the higher \n\nbinding affinity of Fe (hydr)oxides for arsenic and the higher stability of Al under \n\nanoxic conditions can be an advantageous alternative for removing arsenic from water. \n\nIn this study, we investigated the influence of structural Al in the Raman vibrational \n\nstretching modes of goethite and arsenate phases formed on its surface and on other Al \n\nand Fe (hydr)oxides, as well as their potential in adsorbing arsenic. The stability of \n\narsenic retained by aluminium and iron (hydr)oxides under anoxic conditions in the \n\npresence of S. putrefaciens cells, and phosphate or carbonate competing anions was also \n\ninvestigated. Poorly crystalline aluminium hydroxide [Al(OH)3], gibbsite (Gb), 2-line \n\nferrihydrite (Fh), hematite (Hm), goethite (Gt), and three Al-substituted goethites (AlGt) \n\ncontaining 13, 20, and 23 cmol mol-1 of Al were synthesised and characterised chemically \n\nand physically. These adsorbents without and with arsenate were investigated by X-ray \n\ndiffraction, diffuse reflectance, and Raman spectroscopy. Adsorption kinetics at two \n\n\n\n xvi\n\ndifferent solid:solution ratios, 2.0 and 5.0 g L-1, and adsorption isotherms were obtained \n\nafter equilibrating the samples with arsenate solution under constant shaking. As(V) \n\nadsorption maxima was measured at different pH ranging from 3 to 9. The adsorbents \n\nwere anaerobically incubated under N2 atmosphere and supernatants were periodically \n\nsampled to evaluate the contents of soluble As. Presence of structural Al increased the \n\nspecific surface area and the As adsorption capacity of the Gt. The general effects of the \n\nstructural Al were to reduce Gt crystallinity and displace spectral lines. Such structural \n\ndisorder was clearly identified by Raman spectroscopy and X-Ray diffraction. Changes in \n\nvibrational frequencies and linewidths due to structural Al resulted in loss and overlap of \n\nmany Gt active bands. These effects increased as the degree of substitution increased. \n\nRaman technique also confirmed the co-occurrence of magnetite in AlGt13 sample, as \n\nindicated by XRD. As-O vibrational bands were visualised on all Raman spectra, except \n\nfor pure Gt probably due to its lowest content of adsorbed As(V). Positions of As-O \n\nvibrational band suggested that As(V) was strongly retained on the minerals as inner-\n\nsphere surface complexes. In spite of the fast equilibrium, the increase in solid \n\nconcentration limited the efficiency and velocity of arsenic adsorption. The As(V) \n\nadsorption maxima decreased in the following order: Al(OH)3 > Fh > AlGt13 > AlGt20 > \n\nAlGt23 > Gb > Hm > Gt. Nevertheless, by calculating adsorption capacities in terms of \n\nsurface area, Gb, Gt, and Hm showed higher As(V) loading capacity. This suggest that \n\navailable reactive sites were not fully occupied by arsenate on the amorphous and Al-\n\nsubstituted (hydr)oxides. No relationship was observed between medium particle size and \n\nmaxima adsorption. This suggests re-aggregation of the particles during the particle size \n\nmeasurement, or imperfections on the surface of the particles increasing their net charge, \n\nresulting in high adsorption density. The behaviour of all samples was strongly \n\ndependent on pH, and the maximum adsorption was achieved in slightly acidic \n\nconditions. In general, Al hydroxides were more efficient than Fe (hydr)oxides to \n\nremove As(V) from water. The presence of structural Al enhanced considerably the \n\nefficiency of the goethites which showed to be promising as adsorbents to remove \n\narsenic from contaminated water. We found that S. putrefaciens cells were able to bind \n\non mineral surfaces and utilise both noncrystalline and crystalline iron (hydr)oxides as \n\nelectron acceptor releasing arsenic into solution. Al-substituted goethites presented a \n\ndecrease in the fraction of soluble iron and mobilised arsenic as structural Al increased. \n\nThe expected relationship between specific surface area and reductive dissolution of Fe \n\nand As was also affected by the increment in structural Al. Phosphate and carbonate \n\n\n\n xvii\n\naffected the kinetics of iron reduction due to precipitation of soluble iron as metastable \n\nmineral phases (e.g. vivianite and siderite). It seems that analogous mineral phases of \n\nphosphates served as a sink for As limiting its mobilisation. Phosphate competed \n\nstrongly with arsenate and its efficiency seemed to be governed by the nature of the \n\nbinding mechanism between As and adsorbent surface. Higher fraction of arsenic was \n\ndesorbed by phosphate from gibbsite followed by AlGts. Conversely, only Gb showed \n\nsignificant amounts of arsenate displaced by carbonate. In spite of low crystallinity, \n\nAl(OH)3 was the most efficient in retaining arsenate on its surface followed by Fh and \n\nHm.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n xviii\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n \n\nArsenic is a waterborne contaminant and its occurrence in groundwater is a public \n\nhealth concern. The long term exposure to arsenic can lead to critical problems, mainly \n\ncancers. Following the recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO) \n\nmany countries worldwide, including Brazil, have adopted the threshold of 10 ?g L-1 of \nAs in drinking water, as safer for consumption. \n\nAmong the heavy metalloids and oxianions-forming elements (e.g. As, Se, Sb, \n\nMo, V, Cr, U, Re), arsenic is perhaps unique to mobilise at the pH values typically \n\nfound in groundwaters (pH 6.5 \u2013 8.5) and under both oxidising and reducing conditions. \n\nThe geodistribution of As depends on parental rock, and its global average in soil is \n\nabout 5 mg kg-1. Mudstones, shales and slates have the highest concentrations among \n\nthe common rocks, although extremely high concentrations can be found in some coals. \n\nAs the chemistry of arsenic follows closely that of S, the greatest concentration of the \n\nelement tend to occur in sulphide minerals, of which arsenopyrite (FeAsS) is the most \n\nabundant mineral followed by orpiment (As2S3) and realgar (AsS) (Matschullat, 2000; \n\nSmedley and Kinniburg, 2002; O\u2019Day, 2006). Then, the natural input of arsenic in the \n\nenvironment is closely related to weathering of As-bearing rocks and minerals. \n\nAnthropogenic source, i.e. mining and smelting activity and pesticides and wood \n\npreservative uses, has also contributed to such addition.  \n\nIn the environment arsenic can be found as inorganic and organic compounds, in \n\nseveral valence states, i.e. -3, -1, 0, +3, and +5. In natural water arsenic occurs mainly in \n\ninorganic forms as trivalent arsenite [As(III)] (as H3AsO3) or pentavalent arsenate \n\n[As(V)] (as H2AsO4\n- and HAsO4\n\n2-). In addition, in marine waters and lakes arsenic can \n\nundergo microbial methylation and both As(III) and As(V) can coexist with \n\nmonomethilarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethilarsinic acid (DMA). According to \n\nMatschullat (2000), the methylated species account for up to ?10% of the total As in the \n\n\n\n xix\n\neuphotic zone of many oceanic regions. Furthermore, redox potential (Eh) and pH \n\ncontrol the toxicity, mobility, and bioavailability of arsenic as well as the distribution of \n\nits species. Therefore, arsenite is expected to be the stable aqueous form under \n\nmoderately reducing conditions, roughly from Eh of about +300 mV at pH 4 to -200 \n\nmV at pH 9, whilst arsenate is the dominant species in oxidising aqueous solutions \n\n(O\u2019Day, 2006). Because of relatively slow transformation on the redox conditions, both \n\nspecies, As(III) or As(V), can be often found in either redox environment. \n\nNanominerals of aluminium and iron (hydr)oxides are ubiquitous and play a \n\ncrucial role on geochemical and biogeochemical reactions and kinetics of arsenic in the \n\nenvironment. Sorption reactions on the surface of these nanoparticles have been \n\nextensively investigated in order to elucidate the mechanisms associated with arsenic \n\nmobility and bioavailability, as an attempt to improve the methods of water treatment \n\nwhich are still based on coagulation/precipitation processes. Problems with regard to \n\naddition of undesirable anions, such as sulphate, nitrate, and chloride into the water are \n\nthe major limitation of this method as well as the safe separation, handling, and disposal \n\nof the contaminated sludge (Driehaus et al., 1998; Banerjee et al., 2008). Several \n\nadsorbent materials have been assessed, i.e. aluminium hydroxide (Anderson et al., \n\n1976; Ladeira et al., 2001), activated alumina (Mortazavi et al., 1999), natural \n\n(hydr)oxides (Deschamps et al., 2003, 2005; Vithanage et al., 2007), clay minerals \n\n(Manning and Goldberg, 1996a, 1997; Garcia-Sanchez et al., 2002), granular ferric \n\nhydroxides (Driehaus et al., 1998; Wilkie and Hering, 1996), ferrihydrite (Waychunas et \n\nal., 1993; Jain et al., 1999; Jia and Demopoulos, 2005; Jia et al., 2006), goethite (Grossl \n\net al., 1997; Hongshao and Stanford, 2001; Gimenez et al., 2007), and others. \n\nEven though Al and Fe (hydr)oxides have great affinity for arsenic, attention \n\nconcerning the stability of these nanoparticle should be taken into account. As well \n\nknown, the solubility of aluminium hydroxides are much higher than of ferric ones. For \n\ninstance, stability diagrams developed by Lindsay (1979), show that at the same pH \n\nactivity of Al3+ is roughly 106.12 times higher than the activity of Fe3+, both controlled \n\nby their poorly crystalline hydroxide phases, under oxidising conditions. Then, soluble \n\narsenic in equilibrium with Al nanominerals can be a matter of greater concern. On the \n\nother hand, changes in redox status affect considerably the stability of the Fe \n\n(hydr)oxides nanoparticles.  \n\nDissimilatory iron reduction is an important geomicrobial process in soils, \n\nsediments, and aquifers, where it depends primarily on Fe(III) (hydr)oxide minerals as \n\n\n\n xx\n\nterminal electron acceptors (Bonneville et al., 2006). In addition to being an important \n\noxidation pathway of organic matter and generating soluble ferrous iron, microbial iron \n\nreduction can have a major impact on the persistence and mobility of arsenic, toxic \n\nmetals, radionuclides, and organic contaminants under anoxic conditions (Lovley et al., \n\n1993; Cummings et al., 1999; Zachara et al., 2001; Behrends and Van Cappellen, 2005). \n\nMany authors have reported arsenic release as a result of dissimilatory reduction of \n\nFe(III) to Fe(II) (Cummings et al., 1999; Zobrist et al., 2000; Islam et al., 2004; Burnol \n\net al., 2007). Microbially mediated reduction of assemblages comprising arsenic sorbed \n\nto ferric (hydr)oxides is gaining consensus as the dominant mechanism for the \n\nmobilization of arsenic into the West Bengal and Bangladesh aquifers (Smedley and \n\nKinniburg 2002; Islam et al., 2004; O\u2019Day 2006).  \n\nSeveral of the iron (hydr)oxide nanoparticles have isostructural equivalents in \n\nwhich cations other than Fe occupy the interstices of the oxygen framework. Therefore, \n\nthe existence of these isostructural compounds suggests that solid solutions could be \n\nformed between end members via isomorphous substitution for Fe(III) by other cations \n\n(Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003). Al is 17% smaller than iron, and, even though it is \n\nseparated from Fe by forming Al-silicates (clay minerals), a significant proportion is \n\nalways also incorporated into Fe(III) (hydr)oxides. Goethite is one of the \n\nthermodynamically most stable iron oxides (Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003) in soil \n\nand sediments and the full range of substitution in natural sample of up to 33 cmol mol-1 \n\nis found.  \n\nAluminium is stable under anoxic conditions, since it does not participates of the \n\nelectron transferring reactions. For this reason, the presence of structural Al enhance the \n\nstability of the iron (hydr)oxides, as already reported. Slower rate of reductive \n\ndissolution (chemical or microbiological) in the presence of Al substituting Fe in the \n\niron (hydr)oxides structure was reported by Schwertmann (1984), Jeanroy et al. (1991), \n\nand reference therein. Torrent et al. (1987) observed that Al substitution depressed the \n\nreductive dissolution of synthetic goethite and hematite by dithionite/citrate/bicarbonate \n\nsolution. Bousserrhine et al. (1999) also demonstrated that biological reduction of Al, \n\nCr, Mn, and Co-substituted goethites was decreased as substitution increased. Al-\n\ngoethite was more resistant to reductive dissolution than other substituted goethites. \n\nThus, by associating the higher binding affinity of Fe (hydr)oxides for arsenic and the \n\nhigher stability of Al under anoxic conditions can be an advantageous alternative for \n\nremoving arsenic from water.  \n\n\n\n xxi\n\nNatural attenuation of arsenic by adsorption on (hydr)oxides nanominerals may be \n\nalso limited due to competing oxyanions, in which one anion will normally be \n\ncompeting for the sorption sites (Hongshao and Stanforth, 2001; Sahai et al., 2007; \n\nZang et al.; 2008). Due to similar acid dissociation constants phosphate (pKa1 = 2.1, \n\npKa2 = 7.2, \n pKa3 = 12.3) behaves much like arsenate (pKa1 = 2.2, pKa2 = 6.9, \n\n pKa3 = \n\n11.4). Therefore, they should have similar effects on the surface of the (hydr)oxides \n\nnanoparticles. Hongshao and Stanforth (2001) found that under acidic conditions the \n\nquantity of arsenate that is replaced with phosphate from goethite increases with contact \n\ntime before phosphate is added, but the amount of arsenate that can not be replaced with \n\nphosphate is independent of contact time at an initial molar ratio of phosphate to \n\narsenate of 1, and vice versa. Zang et al. (2008) verified that the density of irreplaceable \n\nphosphate or arsenic on goethite decreases to a limit with an increase in the initial \n\nconcentration of the other anion. Liu et al. (2001) reported that more arsenate is \n\nreplaced by phosphate from goethite as the initial molar ratio of phosphate to arsenate \n\nincreases. Manning and Goldberg (1996) suggested that there were sites on the surface \n\nthat were specific for each ion as well as some nonspecific sites on which both ions \n\ncould adsorb.  \n\nIn addition to phosphate, carbonate may also, to a lesser extent, limit the arsenate \n\nsorption reactions. The displacement of adsorbed As with dissolved carbonate was \n\nrecently examined theoretically by Appelo et al. (2002), and this mechanism was \n\nproposed to be potentially one of the major reasons for high As concentrations in \n\ngroundwater. In Bangladesh, the mobilization of As by carbonate has been used to \n\nexplain the occurrence of high levels of As in groundwaters (Anawar et al., 2003).  \n\nThus, it is worthwhile to investigate the adsorption and replacement of one anion \n\nfrom mineral nanoparticles by another. In addition, investigations of the competition \n\nbetween the anions can provide insight into the reactions occurring on the surface. \n\nSpectroscopy investigations show that arsenic is strongly bonded on the surface of \n\nthe Al and Fe (hydr)oxide nanoparticles due to ligand exchange with hydroxyl groups \n\n(OH or OH2), and the formation of inner-sphere binuclear monodentate-bidentate \n\nsurface complexes is the principal binding mechanism (Waychunas et al., 1993; Sun and \n\nDonner, 1996 and 1998; Manning et al., 1998; Goldberg et al., 2001; Ladeira et al., \n\n2001; Ona-Nguema et al., 2005; Makris et al., 2007). Nevertheless, Catalano et al. \n\n(2008) reported outer- and inner-sphere arsenate complexation on the surface of \n\ncorundum and hematite. In the past few years, Raman spectroscopy has also been \n\n\n\n xxii\n\napplied to assess arsenic coordination in a variety of geologic and synthetic material \n\nwith environmental remediation purpose (Myneni et al., 1998; Frost and Kloprogge, \n\n2003; Frost et al., 2003; Frost et al., 2006). Raman spectroscopy is a scattering \n\ntechnique that provides information on vibrational modes of molecules. When photons \n\nof visible light are scattered with the emission or absorption of phonons, the energy (or \n\nfrequency) shifts are very small, but they can be measured. The process is referred to as \n\nRaman Scattering when the phonon emitted or absorbed is optical. Otherwise, they are \n\nacoustical and the process is referred to a Brilhonin scattering. The resulting differences \n\nbetween scattered and incident energy correspond to specific energy-level differences \n\nfor the substance under study and such yield insights into its molecular structure. It can \n\ndistinguish, unambiguously, between minerals with the same stoichiometry but different \n\ncrystal structure. Unlike FTIR, the Raman spectroscopy in aqueous system is \n\nstraightforward because water is a weak Raman scatter. In addition, this technique is \n\nnon-destructive, requires minimal sample preparation, and can be used on massive \n\nspecimens from lump or to fine powder and liquid (Hope et al., 2001). \n\nVibrational spectroscopy studies have shown that the symmetry of the AsO4\n3- \n\ntetrahedron is strongly distorted by the protonation, cation presence, and water \n\ncoordination (Myneni et al., 1998a and 1998b). The vibrational spectra of Ca, Mn, Fe, \n\nCo, Ni, Cu, and Zn AsO4\n3- complexes in crystalline hydrated solids indicate that the As-\n\nOMetal symmetric stretching vibrations shifted to different energies when compared to \n\nthe aqueous AsO4\n3-. For example, the transition metal arsenates, such as those of Mn, \n\nFe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn exhibit a red shift for symmetric stretching vibrations, whilst the \n\nvibrational Al-arsenate spectra shifted to a lower wavenumber, as predicted by \n\ntheoretical studies (Myneni et al. 1998). Among all tetrahedral oxyanions, the position \n\nof the arsenate vibrations occurs at lower wavenumbers than the other naturally \n\noccurring mineral oxyanions (Frost et al., 2006). \n\nAccordingly, this work aimed to investigate experimentally the effectiveness of \n\nsynthetic poorly crystalline aluminium hydroxide, gibbsite, ferrihydrite, hematite, \n\ngoethite, and Al-substituted goethites for adsorbing arsenic from contaminated water \n\nand evaluate the stability of the sorption products face to dissimilatory iron reduction \n\nand competing anions. The results presented herein are divided in three chapters: in the \n\nchapter 1, we investigated the Raman stretching spectra of these synthetic nanominerals \n\nwithout and with loaded As(V) and identified the arsenate phases associated with by \n\nadsorption process; the chapter 2 presents the results of arsenate adsorption process onto \n\n\n\n xxiii\n\nthe surface of the samples assessed by kinetics, isotherm and envelope of adsorption. \n\nFinally, in the chapter 3, we report the effect of bacterial iron reduction and competing \n\nanion, phosphate and carbonate, on arsenic mobilisation. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 1\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 1 \n\n \nRAMAN SPECTROSCOPY OF As(V) LOADED Al AND Fe (HYDR)OXIDES \n\n \n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nRaman spectroscopy has been widely used to characterise Al and Fe (hydr)oxides \nfeatures. Nowadays, that technique has also been applied to the study of contaminants in \nsoils, sediments, and waters. Most of investigations involve identification of arsenate \nphase in connection with Al and Fe (hydr)oxides since they are ubiquitous and play a \nkey role in controlling As mobility and bioavailability. However, these investigations \nhave been carried out on pure minerals, and little is known about the vibrational \nstretching modes of the Fe (hydr)oxides containing structural Al. Thus, the objective of \nthis work was to investigate the influence of structural Al in the vibrational stretching \nmodes of goethite as well as identify the arsenate phase formed on its surface and on \nother Al and Fe (hydr)oxides. Hematite (Hm), goethite (Gt), 2-line ferrihydrite (Fh), \ngibbsite (Gb), poorly crystalline aluminium hydroxide [Al(OH)3], and Al-substituted \ngoethites (AlGts) were synthesised, and characterised chemically and physically. These \nadsorbents without and with adsorbed arsenate were investigated by means of X-Ray \ndiffraction, diffuse reflectance, and Raman spectroscopy. Presence of structural Al \nincreased the specific surface area of the Gt, and its As adsorption capacity. The general \neffects of the structural Al were to reduce Gt crystallinity and displace spectral lines. Such \nstructural disorder was clearly identified by Raman spectroscopy and X-Ray diffraction. \nChanges in vibrational frequencies and linewidths due to structural Al resulted in loss and \noverlap of many Gt active bands. These effects increased as the degree of substitution \nincreased. Raman technique also confirmed the co-occurrence of magnetite in AlGt13 \nsample, as indicated by XRD. As(V) loading adsorbents caused changes or no additional \nphases in the XRD and diffuse reflectance patterns. On the other hand, As-O vibrational \nbands were visualised on all Raman spectra, except for pure Gt probably due to its lowest \ncontent of adsorbed As(V). Positions of As-O vibrational band suggested that As(V) was \nstrongly retained on the minerals as inner-sphere surface complexes, except for Gb and \nHm where a lesser stable complex seems to predominate due to evidence of surface \nprecipitation. After thermal treatment, magnetite transformed completely into Hm which \npresented a red shift on the spectral line evidencing the presence of Al in the magnetite \nlattice. \n\n \nKeywords: Raman spectroscopy, arsenic, Al-substituted goethite, iron and \n\naluminium (hydr)oxides, contamination. \n \n\n\n\n 2\n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\nThe groundwater and surface water contamination by arsenic around the world is \n\na very sensitive issue which has concerned the scientific community. The most serious \n\nproblems related to arsenic contamination have been reported in Bengal Basin (West \n\nBengal and Bangladesh, mainly) where more than 40 million people have been drinking \n\nwater with excessive arsenic (Smedley and Kinniburg, 2002). In Brazil, some areas of \n\nthe Iron Quadrangle mineral province in Minas Gerais State revealed a naturally high \n\nAs background due to arsenopyrite mineralization in either disseminated veins or \n\nfractures, with average As concentrations above 100 mg kg-1 in soils and 100 \u00b5g L-1 in \n\nlocal water (Mello et al., 2006; Deschamps et al., 2005; Matschullat et al., 2000). On the \n\nbasis of chronic toxicological effect of As, currently WHO recommends the threshold of \n\n10 ?g L-1 in drinking water.  \nArsenic in the environment can exist either as organic or as inorganic forms, and \n\nits toxicity depends primarily on its valence states (-3, 0, -1, +3, or +5). Redox potential \n\n(Eh) and pH control As speciation, and then its toxicity, mobility, and bioavailability in \n\nterrestrial environment. In addition, arsenic can be methylated and both As(III) and \n\nAs(V) can coexist with monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid \n\n(DMA). Because of relatively slow transformation on the environmental redox \n\nconditions, both species, As(III) or As(V), can be often found in either redox \n\nenvironment. \n\nThe most common technique for removing arsenic from water is coagulation with \n\nferric salts, followed by filtration (Driehaus et al., 1998). However, due to the \n\ndifficulties to handle the waste generated by coagulation technique, the attempt to seek \n\nfor more efficient methods have propelled the investigation of different adsorptive \n\nmaterials. Adsorptive process have been assessed and materials such as activated \n\nalumina, poorly crystalline ferric hydroxides and granular ferric hydroxides, have been \n\nshown to be more promising due to their high affinity for arsenate (USEPA 2000, and \n\nreferences therein). \n\nThe main surface complexes formed between arsenic and Al and Fe (hydr)oxides \n\nare inner-sphere mono and, or, binuclear, involving ligand exchanges with surface OH \n\nand OH2 groups. These linking mechanisms have been confirmed by different \n\ntechniques, i.e. EXAFS (Waychunas et al., 1993; Manning et al., 1998; Ladeira et al., \n\n2001; Ona-Nguema et al., 2005; Makris et al., 2007), ATR-FTIR (Sun and Donner, \n\n1996 and 1998), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Goldberg et al., 2001).  \n\n\n\n 3\n\nRaman spectroscopy has also been a useful tool to identify arsenic compounds \n\nwith environmental remediation purpose (Frost and Kloprogge, 2003; Frost et al., 2003; \n\nFrost et al., 2006), since its mobility and availability is mostly controlled by Al and Fe \n\n(hydr)oxides. Raman spectroscopy is a scattering technique that provides information \n\non vibrational modes of molecules. When photons of visible light are scattered with the \n\nemission or absorption of phonons, the energy (or frequency) shifts are very small, but \n\nthey can be measured. The process is referred to as Raman Scattering when the phonon \n\nemitted or absorbed is optical. Otherwise, they are acoustical and the process is referred \n\nto a Brilhouin scattering. The resulting differences between scattered and incident \n\nenergy correspond to specific energy-level differences for the substance under study and \n\nsuch yield insights into its molecular structure. It can distinguish, unambiguously, \n\nbetween minerals with the same stoichiometry but different crystal structure. Unlike \n\nFTIR, the Raman spectroscopy in aqueous system is straightforward because water is a \n\nweak Raman scatter. In addition, this technique is non-destructive, requires minimal \n\nsample preparation, and can be used on massive specimens from lump or to fine powder \n\nand liquid (Hope et al., 2001). \n\nVibrational spectroscopy studies have shown that the symmetry of the AsO4\n3- \n\ntetrahedron is strongly distorted by the protonation, cation presence, and water \n\ncoordination (Myneni et al., 1998a and 1998b). The vibrational spectra of Ca, Mn, Fe, \n\nCo, Ni, Cu, and Zn AsO4\n3- complexes in crystalline hydrated solids indicate that the As-\n\nOMetal symmetric stretching vibrations shifted to different energies when compared to \n\nthe aqueous AsO4\n3-. For example, the transition metal arsenates, such as those of Mn, \n\nFe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn exhibit a red shift for symmetric stretching vibrations, whilst the \n\nvibrational Al-arsenate spectra shifted to a lower wavenumber, as predicted by \n\ntheoretical studies (Myneni et al. 1998b). Among all tetrahedral oxyanions, the position \n\nof the arsenate vibrations occurs at lower wavenumbers than the other naturally \n\noccurring mineral oxyanions (Frost et al., 2006). \n\nAlthough several spectroscopy investigations have confirmed the strong \n\nattachment of arsenic onto Al or Fe (hydr)oxide surfaces, no spectroscopic studies have \n\nbeen related to As adsorbed onto Al-substituted goethites. Therefore, this work aimed to \n\ninvestigate the Raman stretching spectra of Al-substituted goethites, hematite, goethite, \n\ngibbsite, poorly crystalline aluminium hydroxide, 2-line ferrihydrite pure, and loaded \n\nwith As(V) and identify the arsenate phases associated with by adsorption process. \n\n \n\n\n\n 4\n\n2. MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n2.1. Synthesis of Al and Fe (Hydr)oxides \n\n2.1.1. Iron (Hydr)oxides Synthesis. Hematite (Hm), Goethite (Gt), and 2-line \n\nFerrihydrite (Fh) were synthesised by neutralizing Fe(NO3)3 solution with KOH \n\nfollowing the procedure described in Schwertmann and Cornell (2000). A series of \n\nAluminium substituted goethite was also synthesised following the methods therein. \n\nThree Al-substituted goethites with different Al:Fe ratio (15:50, 25:50, and 35:50) were \n\nprepared from a ferrous solution and aluminium chloride by precipitation with \n\npotassium hydroxides and aged in a plastic bottle during 90 days. Slow oxidation of \n\nFe2+ to Fe3+ and incorporation of Al3+ in the goethite structure were achieved by \n\nopening the bottle daily and vigorously stirring the suspensions during 5 minutes. \n\nIn order to remove the excess of Al3+, the precipitates were washed twice with 0.01 \n\nmol L-1 KOH solution. All (hydr)oxides were washed with Milli-Q water, \n\ncentrifuged, and dried at 50 oC at an oven with air circulation, except for Ferrihydrite \n\nwhich was freeze-dried. \n\n \n\n2.1.2. Aluminium Hydroxides Synthesis. Gibbsite was prepared following \n\nprocedures outlined in Kyle et al. (1975). An Al(NO3)3 solution was titrated with \n\n4 mol L-1 NaOH solution to a pH of 4.6 \u00b1 0.2. The gelatinous precipitate was heated for \n\ntwo hours at 40 oC, then washed twice, dialyzed against Milli-Q water for 36 days, and \n\ndried at 50 oC. Poorly crystalline aluminium hydroxide was prepared from an \n\naluminium nitrate solution by precipitation with 4 mol L-1 NaOH solution. The \n\nprocedure was similar to that followed for the synthesis of gibbsite, but the heating was \n\nsuppressed step to preserve a low crystallinity. Similarly to ferrihydrite, poorly \n\ncrystalline aluminium hydroxide was freeze-dried in order to prevent further \n\ncrystallization. \n\n \n\n2.2. Characterisation Analyses. Particle size distribution was obtained by laser \n\nparticle size analyser (Micromeritics Saturn Digisizer model 5200). Prior to particle \n\nmeasurement, samples were externally dispersed in a sodium metaphosphate medium \n\nfor 1 h. The content of Al and Fe were determined by wet chemistry methods. Thus, \n\n0.1000 g of dried sample was mixed with 3 mL of HCl and 1 mL of HNO3 (both \n\ndouble-distilled) into a conical Teflon digestion vessels (10 mL) with screw caps. After \n\n10 min the vessels were closed and placed on a hot-plate. The digestion was carried out \n\n\n\n 5\n\nat 120 oC for about 4h, and after that, the samples were left digesting overnight at 70 oC \n\nconstant temperature. After cooling to room temperature, the digested samples were \n\ntransferred to 25 mL volumetric flask, filled with Milli-Q water. Aliquots were \n\ntransferred to 10 ml plastic bottles and stored until measurements. Total Al and Fe were \n\ndetermined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), \n\nusing a perking Elmer Optima 3300 DV. The degree of Al3+ substitution in the Gt was \n\ndetermined by the Al:Fe molar ratio, i.e. cmol mol-1 = Al3+/(Al3++Fe3+)*100. \n\nThe specific surface area was determined by N2 adsorption (BET method) using \n\nmultiple point technique (Quantachrome model NOVA 1000). The sample was \n\npreviously degassed at 110 oC for 2 h with vacuum a continual stream of N2 prior to the \n\nsurface area determination. \n\n \n\n2.3. As(V) Loaded (Hydr)oxides. Al and Fe (hydr)oxides were loaded with \n\narsenate by supplying As(V) to one gram of each sample in 10 mmol L-1 CaCl2 \n\nsolutions at pH 5.0 \u00b10.2. Suspensions were left reacting in a horizontal shaker for one \n\nweek, and after that, the tubes were centrifuged (3000 rpm, 30 min.), the supernatants \n\nwere filtered through 0.22 ?m membrane filters (Millipore Millex-GV, USA) and stored \nfor further As analyses. The As-rich (hydr)oxides were freeze-dried and stored for \n\nfurther spectroscopic studies. Amounts of adsorbed As(V) were calculated by the \n\ndifference between the initial and final As concentration in solution. Arsenic adsorbed \n\nby the reaction vessels were measured in blanks containing arsenic solution but no \n\nadsorbent materials. Contents of As in solution were measured by inductively coupled \n\nplasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), using a Perkin Elmer Optima 3300 \n\nDV. Scandium was used as internal standard to correct for instrumental instabilities and \n\nmatrix effect. Solution of this element was added to the solution to reach a final \n\nconcentration of 44.5 \u00b5mol L-1. Typical detection limits (3?) of 0.42 \u00b5mol L-1 of As \nwere obtained. All assays were carried out in triplicates. \n\n \n\n2.4. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and diffuse reflectance (DR). These techniques \n\nwere used to characterise the synthesised adsorbents and to investigate the influence of \n\nstructural Al in the Gt properties. Self-supporting mounts were prepared by adding \n\npowdered samples (<53 ?m) into rectangular holes of glass slides and Al sample \nholders for further analyses on XRD diffractometer and diffuse reflectance \n\n\n\n 6\n\nspectrometer, respectively. XRD was performed using a cobalt K? radiation at 40 kV \nand 30 mA in a Rigaku diffractometer with graphite monochromator. Acquisition time \n\nfor the XRD patterns in the 4-80o 2? interval was set at 10 sec per 0.05o 2? step. For \nDR, samples were gently pressed against aluminium paper to minimise preferred \n\norientation. Holders were placed into the sphere, and the spectra were recorded from \n\n300 to 900 nm in 0.5 nm steps at 52 nm min-1 using a double cluster GBC, model \n\nCINTRA 20, equipped with an MgSO4-coated integrating sphere 10 cm in diameter. \n\nThe diffuse reflectance spectra of each adsorbent were treated mathematically in order \n\nto eliminate imperfections and noises. From this process, the data were smoothed \n\nfollowing the method stated by Barr\u00f3n et al. (2000). The graphics of the second \n\nderivative of the Kubelka-Munk function [f(KM) = (1 \u2013 R)2/2R, where R is the \n\nreflectance in percentage] were obtained from the percentage of the spectra of the \n\nsmoothed reflectance. \n\n \n\n2.5. Raman Spectroscopy. Analyses were performed on dried samples in a Jobin \n\nYvon/Horiba model LabRam HR 800. The detector was 1024 x 256 pixel liquid \n\nnitrogen cooler charge coupled device (CCD). A He-Ne laser 632.8 nm wavelength and \n\npower output of 20 mW measured at the laser head was used as the excitation force. In \n\norder to avoid sample degradation, the laser power was always kept below 0.08 mW on \n\nthe sample, except for Gb and Al(OH)3. Samples were targeted by the laser beam \n\nthrough microscope objective (Olympus 100X, 0.9 NA), and the scattered light was \n\ncollected through the same objective in a back scattering configuration. The entrance \n\nslits to the spectrograph were 100 micrometers with a correspondent resolution of 2.0 \n\ncm-1. Holographic grating was of 600 g mm-1. Frequency calibration was achieved using \n\nthe 520 cm-1 line silicon. The sample was pressed on a glass slide on the microscope \n\nstage. Acquisition time was at 30 s per scan (? 10). Collected Raman spectra were \nanalysed and optimised with Origin 7.0 software, and the collected spectra were \n\nnormalised and background corrected. \n\nAs magnetite was shown to co-precipitate with the smallest degree of Al \n\nsubstitution, laser-induced thermal effect was also investigated in order to observe the \n\ncrystal stability and feasible phase transformation. Firstly, a darker crystal (magnetite) \n\nwas selected, and a spectrum was obtained at 0.08 mW. Secondly, the filter was \n\nremoved and so the crystal was directly irradiated by the laser beam at 8 mW per three \n\n\n\n 7\n\nseconds. After that, the power of the laser beam was decreased to the initial value (0.08 \n\nmW), and a second run was carried out upon the modified sample. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n3.1. Characterisation Analyses. Assuming the theoretical formula for each \n\nmineral, the recovering percentage by wet digestion was higher than 90%. Trace \n\namounts of Al in Hm, Gt, and Fh, as well as Fe in Gb and poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 \n\nwere, in general, lower than standard error of the mean, and so attributed to analytical \n\nerror. The Al-goethites end products presented 0.13, 0.20, and 0.23 cmol mol-1 of Al \n\n(Table 1). According to these substitution degrees in the Al-goethite structures, they will \n\nbe henceforth referred to as AlGt13, AlGt20, and AlGt23. \n\nFerrihydrite exhibited the highest surface area followed by AlGts. Specific surface \n\narea of the Al-substituted goethites slightly increased as the aluminium incorporation \n\nincreased from 13 to 20 cmol mol-1, but decreased with further increase of Al content. \n\nNo trend between Al content and surface area was observed, as also previously reported \n\nby Schulze and Schwertmann (1987), Strauss et al. (1997), and Gonzales et al. (2002). \n\nAccording to Gonzales et al. (2002) the crystal size of goethite became smaller as Al \n\nsubstitution increased, but no clear trend between Al content and surface area was \n\nobserved.  \n\nParticle size distribution obtained for samples passed through &lt;53 \u00b5m sieve \n\ndecreased in the following order: Fh > Gb > Al(OH)3 > AlGt13 > AlGt20 > AlGt23 > Gt > \n\nHm. Since specific surface area is related to the particle size, the negative correlation \n\nbetween these characteristics was expected. However, no trend was observed between \n\nthis variable and specific surface area (Table 1). An explanation is occurrence of \n\naggregation processes, affecting the particle size measurement, in spite of ultrasonic \n\ndispersion before and during analysis, mainly for ferrihydrite. According to Cornell and \n\nSchwertmann (2003) the small and spherical particles of ferrihydrite often pack together \n\nto form aggregates. Analytical limitation of the laser particle size analysis could be also \n\nargued to explain the lack of correlation. Transformation of diffraction patterns to grain size \n\nis based on matrixes, which are calculated for spheres (Konert and Vandenberghe, 1997). In \n\nthat case, the volume of platy particles (e.g. gibbsite) may be overestimated because such \n\nparticles are larger than their equivalent spherical diameter (Pye and Blott, 2004). \n\nConversely, the volume of elongated  or  very  angular  particles  might  be  underestimated. \n\n\n\n 8\n\nTable 1 \u2013 Surface area (SA), mean particle size (MPS), content of Al and Fe, recovered (Rc), degree of Al substitution in the goethites, \nand adsorbed As(V).

For \n\ninstance, ionic substitution of Al for Fe in the goethite lattice has a marked effect on \n\ngoethite properties, such as variations in crystal size, shape and surface area, and \n\nstructural OH content (Murad and Schwertmann, 1983; Schwertmann, 1984; Schulze \n\nand Schwertmann, 1987; Torrent et al., 1987; Jeanroy et al., 1991) which account for \n\ngreat structural disorder. The amount of adsorbed arsenate calculated herein indicates \n\nthat all adsorbents were fully loaded, as indicated by maximum capacities \n\nmeasurements (Silva et al., 2008). \n\n \n\n3.2. XRD spectra. In general, the XRD patterns revealed well defined sharp \n\npeaks, characteristics of well crystallised minerals for Hm, Gt, and Gb (Figure 1). The \n\nmain peaks corresponds to d(104), d(110), and d(002), as previously reported by Dixon \n\nand Weed (1989) and Cornell and Schwertmann (2003). Ferrihydrite spectrum exhibited \n\nhigh degree of structural disorder with two broad peaks at ~38 and ~74 2? \ncorresponding to d(110) and d(300), typical of 2-line ferrihydrite. Aluminium hydroxide \n\n[Al(OH)3] also showed typical spectrum with no diffraction pattern confirming its poor \n\ncrystallinity. XRD peaks for Al-substituted goethites fairly agree with the pure goethite, \n\nbut with shifts on the diffraction lines towards higher angles due to the presence of \n\nstructural aluminium. It is well known that the size at the unit cell decreases when Al \n\nreplaces Fe in the goethite structure, because the Al3+ ion is slightly smaller than the \n\nFe+3 ion, i.e. 0.053 vs 0.065 nm respectively (Schulze and Schertmann, 1984). The \n\nhigher is the degree of Al substitution the greater are the shifts, as observed herein. In \n\naddition, a narrow peak at ~42o 2? (d = 0.2532 nm) was detected on the AlGt13 XRD \nspectrum, which can be ascribed to magnetite. The presence of magnetite as \n\ncoprecipitated with AlGt13 was confirmed by attraction to a magnet. Magnetite \n\nformation is feasible at low Al/(Al + Fe) ratio due to the slow oxidation of ferrous ions. \n\nAs the aluminium concentration is low, the excess of Fe3+ can encapsulate part of the \n\nsoluble Fe2+ ions, leading to formation of magnetite rather than goethite. At an Al/O4 \n\nmolar ratio close to 0.4, substitution of aluminium for iron tetrahedrically coordinated in \n\nthe magnetite structure is expected (Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003). \n\n \n\n3.3.

Al-substituted goethites \n\nshowed reflectance pattern similar to pure goethite, but with slight shifts of the ?430 nm \nband to shorter wavelengths (blue shift), as Al-substitution increased. In addition, \n\nabsorption bands close to 360-380 nm were pronounced for Al-goethites, which this band \n\nis ascribed to the 6A1       \n4E(4D) ligand field transition of Fe3+ (Sherman and Waite, \n\n1985). Therefore, it can be surmised that this behaviour is due to structural disorder in \n\nthe Gt framework caused by the presence of Al.

We also failed to evidence that relation because the \n\nAlGt13 reflectance spectrum is quite different from the other goethites. It exhibited a \n\nhigher light absorption capacity due to its darker colour as a resulted of the co-\n\noccurrence of the magnetite.  \n\nThe reflectance spectra of the sample loaded with arsenate exhibited no difference in \n\nrelation to the samples without arsenic. Then, it can be assumed that the surface complexes \n\nformed between arsenate and iron (hydr)oxides surface groups do not substantially affected \n\nthe ligand field transition property of the ferric minerals.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 12\n\n300 350 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 750 800 850 900\n-1.6\n\n-1.4\n\n-1.2\n\n-1.0\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\nAlGt\n13\n\nAlGt\n23\n\nL\nog\n\n (\nre\n\nfl\nec\n\nta\nn\n\nce\n)\n\n?

Raman spectroscopy. The As-O stretching vibration is very sensitive to its \n\nenvironment and it has been used to identify different arsenate phases (Goldberg and \n\nJohnston, 2001; Frost et al., 2006; Jia et al., 2006). It can be observed that the Raman \n\nspectra of crystalline (hydr)oxides showed sharp peaks whilst the poorly crystalline \n\nminerals exhibited a noise broad peaks due to high degree of structural distortion.  \n\n \n\n3.4.1. Raman spectra for Gb and poorly crystalline Al(OH)3. Hydroxyl stretching \n\nbands are related to the structural surface of the aluminium minerals and this feature is \n\nwidely used to distinguish similar aluminium phases. For gibbsite the Raman spectrum \n\nin the high frequency region exhibited four strong sharp peaks at 3358, 3431, 3522, and \n\n3615 cm-1 (Figure 4b) which is ascribed to OH gibbsite groups. This result is in line \n\nwith Huneke et al. (1980) and Ruan et al. (2002). In addition, Gb spectrum reveals \n\nseveral picks in the low-medium frequency region (150 \u2013 1050 cm-1) with strong \n\ndoublet at 541/572 cm-1 and a narrow intense peak at 324 cm-1 followed by weak bands \n\nbetween 200 and 450 cm-1 frequency. Three shoulders can be also observed at ?308, \n~360, and ?507 cm-1 (Figure 4a). Probably, the main peaks are due to Al-O vibration \ngroup, and the minor bands in the low-frequency regions arise from vibrational motions \n\nof hydroxyls, lattice modes, and vibrations of hydrogen bonds as argued by Rogers \n\n(1993), and references therein. \n\n \n\n\n\n 13\n\n150 450 750 1050\n\n7 0 0 7 5 0 80 0 85 0 9 0 0 9 5 0 1 0 0 0\n\nR\ne\n\nla\nti\n\nv\ne \n\nIn\nte\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\na.\nu\n\n.)\n\nR am a n  S h ift (cm\n-1\n\n)\n\nG b A s (V ) - p u r e  G b\n\n~ 8 6 7\n\n~\n7\n\n1\n3\n\n~\n3\n\n6\n0\n\n4\n3\n\n04\n1\n\n4\n\n~\n5\n\n9\n0\n\n~\n8\n\n9\n5\n\n5\n7254\n\n1\n\n5\n0\n\n7\n\n3\n9\n\n7\n3\n\n82\n\n32\n4\n\n~\n3\n\n08\n\n25\n7\n\n24\n3\n\nGb+As\n\nPure Gb\n\nAl(OH)3+As\n\n~\n8\n\n23\n\n~\n8\n\n6\n0\n\nR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nin\n\nte\nn\n\nsi\nty\n\n (\na.\n\nu\n.) ~5\n\n8\n3\n\nPure Al(OH)3\n\na\n\n \n\n3000 3100 3200 3300 3400 3500 3600 3700 3800\n\nb\n\n~\n3\n4\n2\n\n9\n3\n4\n3\n1\n\n3\n6\n1\n5\n\n3\n5\n2\n2\n\n3\n3\n5\n8\n\nGb+As\n\nPure Gb\n\nAl(OH)3+As\n\n R\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nin\n\nte\nn\n\nsi\nty\n\n (\na.\n\nu\n.)

This band \npositions lay close to that reported by Goldberg and Johnston (2001) which observed \n\nvibrational band in the 874 cm-1 frequency region for As(V) aqueous solution. These \n\nauthors argued that at pH 5.0 the dominant arsenate species is H2AsO4\n2- with symmetry \n\nof C2v, and addressed that band position to As-O vibrational group. Theoretical studies \n\nhave indicated that Al may strongly distort arsenate tetrahedron and the As-OAl \n\nvibrations should shift to low wavenumbers when compared to the uncomplexed \n\narsenate. FTIR spectra of arsenate in poorly crystalline Al-arsenate supported this \n\nstatement and showed that the As-OAl vibrations shifted to 740 cm\n-1, whilst the As-\n\nOuncomplexed exhibited a broad band at 887 cm\n-1 (Myneni et al., 1998, and reference \n\ntherein). The presence of adsorbed As(V) enhanced the vibrational stretching of the OH \n\nunits and seems to have slightly contributed to diminish the luminescence of the pure \n\nGb spectrum. \n\nRaman spectrum of the poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 exhibits a broad peak at ~590 \n\ncm-1 which is very close to that reported to Gb at 572 cm-1. Then, it also can be assigned \n\nto Al-O stretching vibration unit. The presence of adsorbed arsenate is clearly resolved \n\nby the strong As-O stretching vibration band at ~860 cm-1 (Figure 4a). A band displaced \n\nof 7 cm-1 is also observed in the As(V)-Al(OH)3 sorption product in relation to pure \n\nAl(OH)3 spectra. This finding is also in line with Goldberg and Johnston (2001). These \n\nauthors pointed out that the infrared and Raman-active As-O bands in the 844 \u2013 865 cm-1 \n\nregion are ascribed to As-O vibration of an inner-sphere Al-O-As complex. In our \n\ninvestigation the As-O vibration band lay between this range (~860 cm-1), therefore, we \n\ncan infer that arsenic is strongly retained on Al(OH)3 surface as a very stable surface \n\ncomplex.  \n\nFor poorly crystalline aluminium hydroxide of empirical formula Al(OH)3.3H2O, \n\ntwo types of OH groups maybe assumed, one from the OH units and another from \n\ninterlamellar water (OHH2O). Bands at ~3429 cm\n-1 is assigned to OH stretching vibration \n\nof the hydroxyl unit. The enlargement observed on the pure Al(OH)3 line which starts \n\nfrom ~1250 up to ~3200 cm-1 may be ascribed to OHH2O units due to water stretching \n\nbands (Figure 4b). This OHH2O stretching vibrational bands on arsenate-Al(OH)3 \n\nsorption products spectrum depleted notably, evidencing that the adsorption of As(V) \n\ndetached water molecules. It has been shown that the water can be reversibly lost and \n\nthe number of water molecules per formula unit can vary up to 3 (Frost et al., 2006). \n\n\n\n 15\n\nThen, considering the high structural disorder of the poorly crystalline Al(OH)3, the \n\nexchange of protons between water molecules and arsenate ions is feasible. \n\n \n\n3.4.2. Raman spectra for Hm and Fh. Hematite spectrum exhibited narrow peaks \n\ncharacteristic of a well crystalline mineral (Figure 5). The positions of the Raman-active \n\nbands are in good agreement with previous studies (de Faria et al., 1997; Bouchard and \n\nSmith, 2003; Chamritski and Burns, 2005). Sharp peaks can be observed at 228, 247, \n\n294, 412, 498, 614, and 1315 cm-1. The band at 660 cm-1 can be attributed to structural \n\ndefects on hematite making it appears as a prohibited line on the Raman spectrum. This \n\nband is active on infrared spectrum. The weak broad band at ~840 cm-1 could be better \n\nobserved on the subtracted As(V)-loaded hematite spectrum (Figure 5, inset). This band \n\nis assigned to As-O stretching vibration. Low resolution of this band can be attributed to \n\nthe relative low As(V) adsorption capacity of the Hm in comparison with Fh. This band \n\nposition also lay close that one addressed by Jia et al. (2006) probably as product of \n\nsurface adsorption. No shift was observed on the spectral line due to the presence of \n\nadsorbed As(V), indicating that the sample remained unchanged evenupon the laser \n\nbeam. \n\nSimilarly to Hm, all diagnostic peaks on the Raman spectrum of the 2-line \n\nferrihydrite can be observed at ~368, ~508, ~717, and 1377 cm-1. A shoulder is also \n\nobserved at ~676 cm-1 (Figure 5). These positions of the Raman-active bands agree with \n\nprevious studies carried out by Mazetti and Thistlethwaite (2002). Nevertheless, our \n\nresults differ from that reported by Jia et al. (2006). These authors reported three strong \n\nnarrow peaks at 222, 289, and 407 cm-1. Such pattern would not be expected for poorly \n\ncrystalline minerals which usually exhibit broad and unresolved bands due to their high \n\ndegree of structural disorder. Therefore, this discrepancy may be due to the laser power \n\nused in the experiment. Laser-induced thermal effect on mineral phases was shown by \n\nde Faria et al. (1996) who argued that the laser power magnitude is an important \n\nconsideration when interpreting Raman.  \n\nThe presence of adsorbed arsenate is clearly resolved by the strong As-O stretching \n\nvibration band at ~843 cm-1 (Figure 5) and it is in agreement with that observed for As(V)-\n\nhematite spectra (Figure 5, inset). Arsenic vibration band at 845 cm-1 for inner-sphere \n\nAs(V) complex on ferrihydrite surface was reported by Jia et al. (2006). They attributed \n\nsuch binding mechanism to that complex since the adsorption of As(V) at pH 8 is assumed \n\nto be via binuclear complexation. Thus, the same inference may match for these results. \n\n\n\n 16\n\n \n\n150 300 450 600 750 900 1050 1200 1350 1500 1650 1800\n\n7 0 0 7 5 0 8 0 0 8 5 0 9 0 0 9 5 0 1 0 0 0\n\nR\nel\n\na\nti\n\nv\ne \n\nIn\nte\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\na\n.u\n\n.)\n\nR a m a n  S h ift  ( c m - 1 )\n\nH m A s -  p u r e  H m\n\n~ 8 4 0  \n\nR aman shift (cm\n-1\n\n)\n1\n\n3\n7\n7\n\n~\n7\n1\n7\n\n~\n6\n\n7\n6\n\n~\n5\n0\n8~\n\n3\n6\n8\n\n~\n8\n4\n3\n\n1\n3\n1\n9\n\n6\n6\n\n0\n\n6\n1\n\n4\n\n4\n9\n\n8\n\n2\n4\n\n7\n\n4\n1\n1\n\n2\n9\n4\n\nR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nin\n\nte\nn\n\nsi\nty\n\n (\na.\n\nu\n.)\n\n2\n2\n\n8\n\nP ure H m\n\nH m+A s\n\nP ure F h\n\nF h+A s\n*\n\n \nFigure 5 \u2013 Raman spectra of the hematite (Hm) and 2-line ferrihydrite (Fh) with and \n\nwithout As(V).

Pure Gt spectrum \n\nshows narrow peaks characteristic of a well crystalline mineral (Figure 6). Two strong \n\ncan be visualised at 303 and 389 cm-1 followed by other peaks at 248, 485, 549, 687, \n\nand 1003 cm-1 and two shoulder at 403 and 420 cm-1.

These peaks position are in perfect agreement with previous \n\ninvestigations (de Faria et al., 1997; Oh et al., 1998; Bouchard and Smith, 2003) \n\nconfirming the synthesised goethite. We have not found references to the small peaks at \n\nlow frequencies in the literature, i.e. 169 and 208 cm-1, and that one located at 614 cm-1. \n\nConsequently, these peaks are probably due to some ambiguous variations in the \n\ngoethite lattice. No arsenate stretching vibrational bands were observed on the As(V)-\n\nloaded goethite (spectrum not shown), which can be ascribed to the lowest As(V) \n\nadsorption capacity of goethite. \n\n\n\n 17\n\n150 300 450 600 750 900 1050\n\n6\n1\n4\n\n2\n0\n8\n\n1\n6\n9\n\n~\n6\n\n9\n3\n\n5\n4\n9\n\n~\n4\n4\n\n5\n\n~\n4\n9\n\n1\n\n~\n8\n4\n7\n\npure G oethite\n\nAlG t13 + As\n\nPure AlG t13\n\nPure AlGt20\n\nAlG t20 + As\n\nPure AlG t23\n\n*\n\n1\n0\n0\n3\n\n6\n8\n7\n\n4\n8\n\n5\n\n4\n2\n\n0\n4\n0\n3\n\n3\n8\n9\n\n3\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n4\n\n8\n\nR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nIn\n\nte\nn\n\nsi\nty\n\n (\na.\n\nu\n.)\n\nRaman Shift (cm\n-1\n\n)\n\n2\n0\n5\n\nAlG t23 + As\n\n~680\n\n \nFigure 6 \u2013 Raman spectra of the goethite and Al-substituted goethites (AlGt13, AlGt20, \n\nand AlGt23) with and without As(V). The symbol * indicates residual bands of the \nreagent (NO3\n\n-) used in the synthesis. \n \n\n \n\nAluminium substitution in the goethite structure affected considerably its \n\nvibrational features, especially the resolution of the Raman spectrum. In general, Al had \n\na major influence under the degree of crystallinity and under the frequency of the \n\nspectral bands of the goethite. The main sharp peaks observed on pure Gt spectrum \n\nwere broadened and shifted towards the high frequency region (red shift), as indicated \n\nby vertical bars in Figure 6. For goethites with higher Al content, the lines are broader \n\nand the shifts are less pronounced. For instance, the vibrational frequency of the main \n\nGt peak at 389 cm-1 shifted to ~406 cm-1, and then to 414 cm-1 as the Al content \n\nincreased to 13 and to 20 cmol mol-1, respectively.  \n\nThe relative intensity was also influenced by the presence of structural Al. \n\nReduction on the intensity along with the red shift and linewidth resulted in loss and \n\noverlap of many peaks, especially those observed in the low frequency region of the \n\npure Gt spectrum. Iron is a strongly polarising atom and when it is incorporated into \n\nanother mineral lattice it modifies the vibrational properties of the crystal. For example, \n\nthe presence of a small amount of iron in the structure of spharelite enhanced the \n\nintensity of its second-order Raman spectrum (Mernagh and Trudu, 1993). Hence, a \n\n\n\n 18\n\ncounter effect, i.e. substitution of iron in the (hydro)xide lattices by other ions (e.g. Al), \n\nshould result in intensity depletion. The scope of this process occurs gradually as \n\nsuggested by the two shoulders at 445 and 491 cm-1 on the AlGt13 spectrum, probably \n\nproduct of the Raman band alterations at 420 and 485 cm-1 on pure Gt spectrum.  \n\nIn general, the presence of arsenate phase adsorbed on Al-substituted goethites \n\ncan be visualised at ~847 cm-1 frequency on the As(V)-AlGt Raman spectra (Figure 6). \n\nEven though arsenate band on the As(V)-AlGt Raman spectrum is more pronounced as \n\nstructural Al increase, arsenate seems to be more associated with iron than aluminium, \n\nsince the As(V)-AlGt band positions are much closer to those verified for Hm (~840) \n\nand Fh (~843) than those observed for Gb (~867 cm-1) and poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 \n\n(~860 cm-1). Similar to other Raman spectra analysed herein , these bands are also \n\nascribed to As-O stretching vibrational group.  \n\nThe Raman technique also revealed that AlGt13 sample is rather heterogeneous. \n\nThe well resolved Raman-active band at ~680 cm-1 is characteristic of magnetite, formed \n\nduring the synthesis, as argued earlier. This band appears wider and somewhat shifted \n\nconcerning to that one observed at 670 cm-1 for pure magnetite (Gasparov et al., 2000; \n\nChamritski and Burns, 2005). Fe3O4 has an inverse spinel, cubic unit cell, and there are \n\ntwo iron position in the magnetite structure: A positions characterised by tetrahedral \n\noxygen surrounding the Fe ions, which is occupied only by Fe3+; whereas the octahedral \n\nB positions can be occupied by Fe2+ and Fe3+ (Gasparov et al., 2000). Thus, substitution \n\nof Al3+ for tetrahedral Fe3+ is feasible to occur, as discussed previously (section 3.2.1). \n\nAs these modifications are the same of those verified for AlGts, i.e. increase in \n\nfrequency and linewidth, we infer that Al is also incorporated in the magnetite lattice. \n\n \n\n3.4.4. Raman spectra for Magnetite and phase transformation. In order to \n\nconfirm the presence of co-precipitated magnetite and to investigate the laser-induced \n\nthermal effect giving rise to magnetite phase transformation, the laser was set at a \n\ndarker region on the sample. The Raman-active bands observed at 190, 315, and 680 \n\ncm-1 confirmed the co-occurrence of magnetite with AlGt13. The peak at ~670 cm\n-1 is \n\nassigned to A1g mode which has a higher frequency than Eg mode and is addressed to \n\nthe stretching vibrations of the oxygen atoms along the Fe(A)-O bonds (Gasparov et al., \n\n2000). Similarly to that observed on the AlGt13 spectrum, the main magnetite Raman-\n\nactive peak at ~680 cm-1 present a red shift of approximately ~10 cm-1 as well as a \n\nbroad shape (Figure 7).

Pure \nhematite spectrum was plotted in order to compare with heated magnetite spectrum.  \n\n \n\n \n\nmagnetite spectrum (Gasparov et al., 2000; Chamritski and Burns, 2005) were lost due \n\nto spectral modifications on the linewidth. This lack can be ascribed to the presence of \n\nAl in the magnetite lattice.  \n\nIn relation to thermal treatment, magnetite showed to be very sensitive. After \n\nthree seconds of higher laser irradiation, magnetite transformed completely into \n\nhematite-like phase, as shown in Figure 7. Nevertheless, the hematite-like spectrum \n\nobtained after heating the magnetite crystal differs from that recorded for pure hematite. \n\nAll Raman-active bands on the hematite-like spectrum presented a red shift as well as a \n\ndecrease in relative intensity. Considering that Al is not lost during the heat process, \n\nthese changes can be also ascribed to the presence of structural Al replacing iron. \n\nHematite-like spectrum presented a red shift (40 cm-1) in the higher frequency region \n\n(>1300 cm-1) in comparison with pure Hm one (Figure 7). For natural and synthetic \n\nHm, the band at 411 cm-1 is particularly sensitive to variations caused by hydration, by \n\nion substitution, or by the temperature of the sample (Bouchard and Smith, 2003). \n\n\n\n 20\n\nIndeed, this band is displaced on Hm-like spectra, but our data suggest that the band at \n\nthe higher frequency region seems to be most sensitive to such variations. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS \n\nRaman spectroscopy and complementary XRD and diffuse reflectance were used \n\nto characterise different Al and Fe (hydr)oxides, to investigate the influence of \n\nstructural Al in the goethite vibrational features as well as to identify the arsenate phase \n\nformed on the mineral surfaces. Spectroscopic results of the synthesised mineral phases \n\nfairly agreed with previous data reported in the literature. The presence of aluminium \n\nincreased greatly the specific surface area of the goethite and improved its efficiency in \n\nadsorbing As(V). In addition, aluminium distorted considerably the spectroscopic \n\npatterns of the goethite mostly displacing its spectral lines due to change in its unit cell \n\nparameters. Raman spectroscopy was the major technique to reveal the structural \n\ndisorder caused by Al in the Gt properties. Furthermore, this technique was sensible to \n\ndetect As(V) adsorbed on the mineral surfaces, mainly on poorly crystalline Al(OH3) \n\nand ferrihydrite. Raman spectra in general revealed well resolved bands between 800 \n\nand 915 cm-1 frequencies, addressed to As-O stretching vibrational groups. The \n\npresence of arsenate was not visualised for Gt and rather slightly observed for Hm \n\nprobably due to their lower As(V) adsorption capacities. As a general observation, our \n\nresults agree that arsenic is retained as inner-sphere complex on poorly crystalline \n\nAl(OH)3, Fh, and AlGts. But for Gb and Hm a lesser stable complex seems to \n\npredominate due to evidence of precipitation on their surface. The presence of \n\ncoprecipitated magnetite was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and X-Ray diffraction. \n\nEvidence of aluminium replacing iron even in the magnetite lattice was supported by \n\nmodifications on its main spectral band along with the laser-induced Hm-like Raman \n\nspectrum. \n\nIn soils, goethite is the most stable ferric mineral and generally present \n\nappreciable amount of incorporated Al in its lattice, then, the immobilisation of \n\ncontaminants, i.e. arsenate, may to a certain extent to be more associated with Al-\n\nsubstituted goethites than to other pure crystalline Fe (hydr)oxides. Although poorly \n\ncrystalline Fe hydroxides participates more efficiently in sorption processes due to their \n\nlarger surface area and consequently higher number of reactive surface sites, they are \n\nprimarily dissolved via bioreduction reactions under anoxic conditions (low Eh), \n\n\n\n 21\n\nresulting in arsenic mobilisation. In contrast, the presence of structural Al is expected to \n\nenhance the stability of goethites face to reductive dissolution. Consequently, the \n\ndissolution-desorption mechanisms is limited in Al-substituted goethite, contributing to \n\nprevent the arsenic dispersion. Nevertheless, further studies are warranted to better \n\nunderstand the role of aluminium in the sorption mechanisms and in the stability of the \n\nbinding complex formed between arsenic and goethite surface under environmental \n\nconditions. \n\nRaman spectroscopy in association with other techniques figures as an important \n\ntool to identify and characterise individual minerals. This is relevant in environmental \n\nsciences, which deal with complex matrixes, generally composed by an assemblage of \n\nminerals. Especially Al and Fe (hydr)oxides and their anion sorption products which \n\ncan be assessed since each anion has its own vibrational stretching bands. Additionally, \n\nit is possible to detect the occurrence of ion substitutions that contribute to modify the \n\nmineral features. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 22\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5.

Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the potential \nof Al-substituted goethites in adsorbing arsenic compared with other Fe and Al \n(hydr)oxides. Hematite (Hm), goethite (Gt), 2-line ferrihydrite (Fh), gibbsite (Gb), \naluminium hydroxide [Al(OH)3], and three Al-substituted goethites containing 13, 20, and \n23 cmol mol of Al (AlGt13, AlGt20, and AlGt23, respectively) were synthesised and used \nas adsorbent for As(V). Adsorption kinetics at two different solid:solution ratios, 2.0 and \n5.0 g L-1, and adsorption isotherms were obtained after equilibrating the samples with \narsenate solution for respectively 96 and 24 hours under constant shaking. As(V) \nadsorption maxima was measured at different pH ranging from 3 to 9. In spite of the fast \nequilibrium, the increase in solid concentration limited the efficiency and velocity of \narsenic adsorption. The As(V) adsorption maxima decreased in the following order: \nAl(OH)3 > Fh > AlGt13 > AlGt20 > AlGt23 > Gb > Hm > Gt. Nevertheless, by calculating \nadsorption capacities in terms of surface area, Gb, Gt, and Hm showed higher As(V) \nloading capacity than Fh. This suggest available reactive sites not fully occupied by \narsenate on the amorphous and Al-substituted (hydr)oxides during the adsorption \nexperiment. No relationship was observed between average particle size and adsorption \nmaxima. This suggests re-aggregation of the particles during the particle size \nmeasurement, or imperfections on the surface of the particles increasing their net charge, \nresulting in high adsorption density. The behaviour of all samples was dependent on pH, \nand the maximum adsorption was achieved in slightly acidic conditions. In general, Al \n(hydr)oxides were more efficient than Fe (hydr)oxides to remove As(V). The presence \nof structural Al enhanced considerably the arsenic uptake capacity of the goethites \nwhich showed to be promising as an adsorbent to remove arsenic from water. \n\n \nKeyword: arsenic, kinetics, adsorption envelope, Al-goethites, Al and Fe hydroxides. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 28\n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\nArsenic contamination has been considered an important and very sensitive issue \n\ndue to its high toxicity to man and other living organisms. The current World Health \n\nOrganization (WHO) guideline for arsenic in drinking water is 10 \u00b5g L-1. This limit is \n\nrecommended by WHO based on toxicological test and was already adopted in many \n\ncountries, such as Brazil, United State of America, Germany, and others. In Australia, \n\nthe drink water guideline value for As is 7 \u00b5g L-1 (NHMRC &amp; NRMMC, 2004). \n\nNevertheless, the presence of arsenic in ground and surface water has been found in \n\nvalues higher than this threshold. \n\nSome parts of Bangladesh, West Bengal, Inner Mongolia, Vietnam, India, \n\nMexico, Argentina, Chile, and Brazil are well known regions with anomalous levels of \n\nAs in drinking water (Matschullat et al., 2000; Smedley and Kinninburg, 2002; Smedley \n\net al., 2003). Weathering of As-rich parental material and human activities, such as use \n\nof arsenical fertilizers and pesticides as well as industrial and mining activities are \n\nprominent contamination source. In Brazil, in the past, an estimated 3.1 million metric \n\ntons of tailing materials with average As content of 14,500 mg kg-1 have been deposited \n\nalong valleys without adequate assessment of environmental impact (Deschamps et al., \n\n2002). Moreover, previous studies in these areas revealed a naturally high As \n\nbackground, with average As concentrations above 100 mg kg-1 in soils and 100 \u00b5g L-1 \n\nin local water (Matschullat et al., 2000; Deschamps et al., 2002; Mello et al., 2006). \n\nThe biogeochemical cycle of arsenic has been reviewed by Anderson and Bruland \n\n(1991), Schnoor (1996), Matschullat (2000), Smedley and Kinniburg (2002), and others. \n\nThe distribution of arsenic species in the environment depends primarily on redox \n\npotential (Eh) and pH (e.g. H3AsO4/H2AsO4\n- pKa1 = 2.2; H2AsO4\n\n-/HAsO4\n2- pKa2 = 6.9; \n\nHAsO4\n2-/AsO4\n\n3- pKa3 = 11.4). In well-oxidised water, arsenate [As(V)] as H2AsO4\n- and \n\nHAsO4\n2- is the predominant species while arsenite [As(III)] occur predominately in \n\nreduced environments mainly as H3AsO3. Nevertheless, both species can be often found \n\nin either redox environment due to relatively slow transformation on the redox \n\nconditions. \n\nSorption processes also play an important role on As behaviour controlling its \n\nmobility and bioavailability. Hydroxyl groups (OH and OH2) in the coordination \n\nspheres of metals on the mineral surfaces are the most abundant and reactive adsorption \n\nsites. Consequently Al and Fe (hydr)oxides have a strong affinity for As(V) (Pierce and \n\nMoore, 1982; Stumm and Sulzberger, 1992). The strong retention of As(V) by oxides \n\n\n\n 29\n\nand hydroxides is ascribed to inner-sphere mononuclear or binuclear monodentate-\n\nbidentate surface complexes (Waychunas et al., 1993; Sun and Doner, 1996; Fendorf et \n\nal., 1997). \n\nThere are many different technologies for removing arsenic from drinking water. \n\nPrecipitation/coagulation or adsorption processes have been preferably considered at the \n\nwater plant treatment. A number of investigation has focused on using aluminium and \n\nferric salts (Jekel, 1994; Wickramasinghe et al., 2004) and natural or synthetic Fe or Al \n\n(hydr)oxides (Anderson et al., 1976; Driehaus et al., 1998; Ladeira et al., 2001; Garc\u00eda-\n\nSanchez et al., 2002; Deschamps et al., 2003; Ladeira and Ciminelli 2004; Deschamps \n\net al., 2005). The use of aluminium or ferric salts as a coagulant can lead to parallels \n\nproblems regards to the addition of undesirable anion, such as sulphate, nitrate, and \n\nchloride into the water. Other problems associated with this technique are the safe \n\nseparation and the handling of the contaminated coagulant sludge (Driehaus et al., \n\n1998).  \n\nThe adsorption technique has secured a place in advanced methods of arsenic \n\nremoval because of the easy handling of the sludge, free operation and regeneration \n\ncapability. For this reason, metal (hydr)oxides have been studied by many researchers \n\nwith regards to the developing technologies for arsenic removal from contaminated \n\nwater. These materials include amorphous ferric hydroxides (Pierce and Moore, 1982), \n\ngranular ferric hydroxides (GFH) (Driehaus et al., 1998), crystalline ferric hydroxide \n\n(Manna et al., 2003), amorphous aluminium hydroxides (Anderson et al., 1976), natural \n\nFe and Mn minerals (Deschamps et al., 2003, 2005), activated alumina (Singh and Pant, \n\n2004; Sierra-Alvarez et al., 2005). In general, methods using Fe (salt) are more effective \n\nthan Al in removing As from water. Nevertheless, Fe (hydr)oxides used to remove As \n\nfrom water are rather unstable in low Eh environments. Thus, under reducing \n\nconditions, the mechanism of arsenic sorption may also depend on Fe reduction \n\n(Cummings et al., 1999). \n\nThe disposal of Fe-As-rich waste generated at water treatments plants is an \n\nenvironmental concern, and requires the development of methods to improve the \n\nstability of these compounds under anaerobic conditions. Previous investigations have \n\nsuggested a positive correlation between goethite stability under reducing conditions \n\nand structural Al content (Schwertmann, 1991; Maurice et al., 2000; Gonzales et al., \n\n2002). In this study we assessed the potential of Al-substituted goethites in adsorbing \n\narsenate in comparison to other Al and Fe (hydr)oxides. \n\n\n\n 30\n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n2.1. Adsorbents \n\nAluminium and iron (hydr)oxides were synthesised, and the main characteristics of \n\nall adsorbents are in Table 1. Hematite, Goethite, and 2-line Ferrihydrite were \n\nsynthesised following the procedure described in Schwertmann and Cornell (2000). A \n\nseries of aluminium substituted goethites were also synthesised following the methods \n\ntherein. The Al-goethites were prepared by precipitation of ferrous and aluminium \n\nchloride solution with potassium hydroxide solution and aged in a plastic bottle during \n\n90 days. Slow oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ and incorporation of Al3+ in the goethite structure \n\nwere achieved by opening the bottle daily and stirring the suspension vigorously during \n\nfive minutes. In order to remove the excess of Al, the precipitates were washed twice \n\nwith 0.01 mol L-1 KOH solution. Precipitates of (hydr)oxides were washed several times \n\nwith Milli-Q water, centrifuged and dried at 50 oC at an oven with air circulation, except \n\nfor ferrihydrite which was freeze-dried Gibbsite was prepared following the procedures \n\noutlined in Kyle et al. (1975). An Al(NO3)3 solution was titrated with a 4 mol L\n-1 NaOH \n\nsolution to a pH of 4.6 \u00b10.2. The gelatinous precipitate was heated for two hours at 40 \noC, then washed twice, dialyzed against Milli-Q water for 36 days, and dried at 50 oC. \n\nPoorly aluminium hydroxide was also prepared from an aluminium nitrate solution by \n\nprecipitation with 4 mol L-1 NaOH solution. The procedure was similar to that followed \n\nfor the synthesis of gibbsite, but with the suppression of the heating step to preserve low \n\ncrystallinity. Similarly to ferrihydrite, the aluminium hydroxide was freeze-dried in \n\norder to prevent its crystallization.  \n\nPrior to any analysis, all samples were passed through the &lt;53 \u00b5m sieve. The \n\nspecific surface area was determined by N2 adsorption, BET method, using multiple \n\npoint technique (Quantachrome model NOVA 1000) and particle size was measured \n\nusing a Micromeritics Saturn Digisizer model 5200. The identity of the desired mineral \n\nphases were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and \n\ndiffuse reflectance for the iron (hydr)oxides. Additional details can be seen on Silva et \n\nal. (2008).  \n\n \n\n2.2. Adsorption Isotherms. Batch experiments were carried out to obtain \n\nadsorption isotherms at pH 5.0 \u00b10.2 and 25 \u00b10.1 oC. As(V) solutions were prepared \n\ndissolving in Milli-Q water analytical reagent grade di-sodium hydrogen arsenate \n\nheptahydrate (Na2HAsO4 7H2O; Ajax Finechem).

After 24 h the \n\nsamples were then centrifuged and syringe filtered using 0.22 \u00b5m membrane filters \n\n(Millipore Millex-GV, USA). The filtered was acidified and stored for further As analyses.  \n\n \n\n2.3. As(V) Adsorption Kinetics. The As(V) adsorption kinetics were assessed at two \n\ndifferent solid:solution ratios, i.e. 2.0 and 5.0 g L-1, and at initial As(V) concentration \n\ncorresponding to 0.100, 0.200, 0.250, 0.400, 1.200, and 1.500 mmol g-1 of Gt, Hm, Gb, \n\nAlGts, Fh, and Al(OH)3, respectively. Preliminary test showed that these concentrations \n\nwere close to maximum As(V) adsorption. An arsenate stock solution was prepared in 10 \n\nmmol L-1 CaCl2 containing As concentration of 13.35 mmol L\n-1. Adsorption kinetics were \n\nobtained at pH 5.0 \u00b10.2 by equilibrating the solid sample (0.0500 g or 0.1250 g) with 25 \n\nmL of doped solution for 96 h at 25 \u00b10.1 oC. Solutions with adequate As(V) concentration \n\nfor each adsorbent were placed into a 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes with screw \n\ncaps and conical base, and equilibrated on a rotary shaker. During the first four hours, pH \n\nwas checked and corrected when necessary with HNO3 or NaOH. The ionic strength was \n\nset at 10 mmol L-1 using CaCl2. Aliquots of the supernatants were periodically collected at \n\n0.5, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 96 h of reaction, and immediately syringe filtered using 0.22 \u00b5m \n\n\n\n 32\n\nmembrane filters (Millipore Millex-GV, USA), acidified, and stored for further As \n\nanalyses.  \n\n \n\n2.4. As(V) Adsorption Envelopes. Adsorption envelopes were obtained by \n\nadsorption isotherm at different pre-adjusted pH values ranging from 3 to 9. The pH was \n\nadjusted by adding HNO3 or NaOH. The pH was measured and adjusted during the first \n\nfour hours when necessary and at the end of the experiment. In addition, blank experiments \n\ncontaining only arsenic solution were used to measure the amount of arsenic adsorbed by \n\nthe walls of the reaction vessels. \n\n \n\n2.5. Analytical Techniques. Arsenic in the equilibrium solutions was measured by \n\ninductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), using a Perkin \n\nElmer Optima 3300 DV. Scandium was used as internal standard to correct for instrumental \n\ninstabilities and matrix effect. Solution of this element was added to the solution to reach a \n\nfinal concentration of 2.0 mg L-1. Typical detection limits (3?) of 0.134 \u00b5mol L-1 As were \nobtained. All assays were carried out in triplicates. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n3.1. Adsorption Isotherms. The different arsenate concentration ranges added were \n\nsufficient to achieve the maximum adsorption for all adsorbents (Figure 1). Adsorption \n\nisotherm taking into account the whole data fitted well to Langmuir model. Nevertheless, \n\ndifferent adsorption regions can be clearly visualised for Hm, Fh, Gb, and AlGt20. It is \n\ndetermined that these are related to the affinity of arsenate for at least two distinct \n\nenergetically reactive sites on their surface. \n\nIn order to obtain the maximum arsenate adsorption, the data were fitted to the linear \n\nform of the Langmuir equation [C/q = (1/Kb) + (C/b)], where C is the equilibrium \n\nconcentration of As(V) remaining in the solution (mmol L-1), q is the amount of adsorbed \n\narsenate by the sorbent (mmol g-1), b is the maximum arsenic adsorption (mmol g-1), and K \n\nis the constant related to the energy of adsorption (L mmol-1). It was utilised the second \n\nregion of adsorption as preconised by Muljadi et al. (1966) for phosphate.

Solid line represents \ntheoretical Langmuir model (Asads = K*b*Aseq/1+K*Aseq) where Asads is the maximum \nof adsorbed arsenate by the sorbent (mmol g-1), K is the constant related to the energy of \nadsorption (L mmol-1), b is the arsenate adsorption maximum (mmol g-1), and Aseq is the \nequilibrium concentration of As(V) remaining in the solution (mmol L-1). Data are \nrepresented as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean (n = 3); bars not visible are smaller \nthan symbol. \n\n\n\n 34\n\nthese authors, the second region of the isotherm is the best suited to Langmuir\u2019s \n\npresupposition. Experimental data presented a good fit to the Langmuir equation, with \n\ncorrelation coefficient (r2) values higher than 0.99 (Table 2). \n\nIncorporation of Al in the goethite structure favoured the adsorption of As(V) in \n\nrelation to pure goethite, and other crystalline phases, i.e. Hm and Gb. According to \n\nSchulze and Schwertmann (1987) goethite crystals become smaller as Al-substitution \n\nincreases, changing its structure from polydomainic crystals to smaller monodomainic ones. \n\nLikewise, the incorporation of aluminium can also lead to structural defects with cation \n\ndeficiency in the goethite framework (Gonzales et al. 2002) that contributes to increase the \n\nnumber of surface reactive sites, which is in agreement with their relatively large surface \n\nareas. Even though a large arsenate adsorption had been observed on AlGts, the Langmuir \n\nadsorption maxima (b) somewhat diminished with further increases in Al:Fe molar ratio \n\n(Table 2). This suggest a higher affinity between As and structural iron at the AlGts surface \n\nas reflected by the increase in As adsorbed per mol of iron. Decreasing of arsenate \n\nadsorption with the increase of structural Al was reported by Masue et al. (2007) to \n\ncoprecipitated Al:Fe hydroxides. On the other hand, the lower As(V) adsorption capacity \n\ncould be attributed to fewer surface reactive hydroxyls or water groups in well crystallised \n\nHm, Gb, and pure Gt. Our results for maximum As(V) adsorptions agree well with the \n\nfindings of previous work: poorly crystalline aluminium hydroxides of approximately 1.6 \n\nmmol g-1 at pH 5 (Anderson et al., 1976; Garcia-Sanchez et al., 2002), goethite ranging \n\nfrom 0.04 up to 0.186 mmol g-1 with maximum pH at 3.0 (Manning and Goldberg, 1996; \n\nLiu and Violante, 2001), and ferrihydrite from 1.0 to >2.6 mmol g-1 at pH 5 (Fuller et al., \n\n1993; Raven et al., 1998; Garcia-Sanchez et al., 2002). \n\nSpectroscopic investigations, i.e. FTIR, EXAFS, XANES, have shown that arsenate \n\nadsorption on ferric compounds occur via ligand exchange with OH and OH2 groups \n\nforming inner-sphere mono or binuclear complexes (Manceau, 1995; Sun and Doner, 1996; \n\nFendorf et al., 1997; Grossl et al., 1997; Sherman and Randall, 2003; Makris et al., 2007). \n\nEXAFS studies have shown that arsenate adsorption on ferrihydrite and goethite occurs \n\npredominantly as bidentate bridging complex and the formation of monodentate surface \n\noccurs to only at a limited extent and low surface coverage (Waychunas et al., 1993; \n\nFendorf et al., 1997). The formation of stable complexes has been also  reported  for \n\n\n\n 35\n\nTable 2 \u2013 Adsorption maxima (b), binding constant (K), and correlation coefficient (r2) of \nthe linear form of the Langmuir Isotherm for arsenate adsorption onto different Fe and \nAl compounds \n\nAdsorbent b K R2 \n\n --- mmol g-1 --- --- mmol m-2 --- --- mmol mol-1 Fe --- --- L mmol-1 ---  \n\nHm 0.193 0.0055 16.409 2.562 0.9949 \nGb 0.228 0.0050 18.415a/ 7.116 0.9964 \nGt 0.101 0.0049 9.806 10.188 0.9988 \n\nAlGt13 0.417 0.0035 51.010 22.301 0.9988 \nAlGt20 0.395 0.0032 54.462 35.401 0.9996 \nAlGt23 0.365 0.0032 53.5187 13.634 0.9975\n\nFh 1.258 0.0047 132.896 2.0408 0.9932 \nAl(OH)3 1.498 0.1805 188.813\n\na/ 4.1620 0.9995 \na/ mmol mol-1 of Al. \n\n \n\n \n\naluminium hydroxides and gibbsite (Foster et al., 1998; Ladeira et al., 2001; Goldberg and \n\nJohnson, 2001; Arai and Sparks, 2002; Liu et al., 2006). Therefore, these complexes have \n\nlikely been formed in our materials. However, further spectroscopic evidences are \n\nwarranted to certificate the type of surface complexes preferentially formed at our \n\nconditions. \n\nCalculated K values from the Langmuir function showed the following order: AlGt20 \n\n> AlGt13 > AlGt23 > Gt > Gb > Al(OH)3 > Hm ? Fh. Though the empirical K values has \n\nlittle or no significance as a theoretical chemical binding constant, this constant is rather \n\nuseful for assessing comparative adsorption behaviour of different materials (Lafferty and \n\nLoeppert, 2005). In general, the crystalline adsorbents demonstrated higher arsenate \n\nretention capacity than poorly crystalline ones, except for Hm which K value laid close to \n\nFh. Higher K values for Gt than Fh indicates its relative strong retention capacity for \n\narsenate. Similar results were reported by Dixit and Hering (2003) and Lafferty and \n\nLoeppert (2005). Al-substituted goethites demonstrated higher affinity in adsorbing arsenic \n\nthan pure Gt suggesting that incorporation of Al affect positively the interaction between \n\narsenic and iron (hydr)oxides, however, no trend was observed between K value and Al \n\ncontent. Masue et al. (2007) also observed strong retention capacity of arsenate to \n\ncoprecipitated Al:Fe hydroxides, but the affinity decreased as Al:Fe molar ratio was \n\nincreased.  \n\n\n\n 36\n\nThe maximum As(V) adsorption capacity decreased in the following order: Al(OH)3 \n\n> Fh > AlGt13 > AlGt20 > AlGt23 > Gb > Hm > Gt. The higher amount of arsenate adsorbed \n\nby poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 and Fh could be attributed to their considerably larger \n\nspecific surface area. The higher adsorption efficiency verified for Al(OH)3 in comparison \n\nwith Fh was also reported by Garcia-Sanchez et al. (2002). They attributed such results to \n\ndifferent types of isotherm as classified by Giles et al (1960) (see also in Garcia-Sanchez et \n\nal., 2002). According to these authors adsorption isotherms for poorly crystalline \n\naluminium hydroxides is H (high affinity) while for Fh is L (Langmuirian) type. This mean \n\nthat aluminium hydroxides initially has such a strong affinity for As(V) that in short time \n\nthe anions are almost completely adsorbed in diluted solutions. As the sites in aluminium \n\nhydroxides surface are occupied, it becomes increasingly more difficult for As(V) anions to \n\nreact to empty active sites in the adsorbent. On the other hand, this adsorption pattern was \n\nnot observed for Fh, being slower and likely taking place in two steps. Fuller et al. (1993) \n\nalso observed an initial rapid adsorption rate of arsenate on ferrihydrite followed by a much \n\nslower kinetic due to a diffusion-controlled rate-determining step.  \n\nIn general, the AlGts showed high As(V) loading capacity per mol of Fe being 3.2 \n\nand 5.4 times higher than Hm and pure Gt, respectively, but 2.5 times smaller than Fh \n\n(Table 2). \n\nNormalized adsorption data by surface area demonstrated that the arsenate loading \n\ncapacity was similar to Gb, Hm, and Gt followed by Fh and somewhat lower for AlGts \n\n(Figure 2). These results indicated that surface sites for Fh were not fully occupied by \n\nAs(V) anions, as we obtained an adsorption density (? 0.13 mol mol-1 Fe) lower than the \nmaximum stated to Fh by Dixit and Hering (2003) and reference therein, i.e. 0.25 mol mol-1 \n\nFe at pH near to 4.6. This behaviour could be attributed to the relative short time frame \n\nadopted herein (24 h), therefore, our result is consistent with previous reported data, \n\nranging from 0.11 up to 0.14 mol mol-1 Fe (Ferguson and Anderson, 1974; Raven et al., \n\n1998; Pierce and Moore, 1982). \n\n \n\n3.2. As(V) Adsorption kinetics. Adsorption kinetics of As(V) followed two different \n\nphase patterns (Figure 3). An initial fast phase corresponding to adsorption in the first \n\ncouple of hours, and then, a slower phase from 2 to 92 hours.

According to \n\nHongshao and Stanforth (2001) adsorption in the first phase corresponds to irreversibly \n\nbound ion, while further slowly adsorbed ions are weakly bounded and easily exchanged by \n\na competing anion, e.g. phosphate, silicate, and carbonate, etc. Many mechanisms are \n\nthought to be related to the second phase, such as precipitation on the surface, diffusion into \n\nsurface pores or in the adsorbent matrix, formation of a solid-solution on the surface, or \n\ncoagulation of the adsorbent particles. Though we have no spectroscopic evidence, we \n\nsuppose that anion-induced dissolution (Hongshao and Stanforth, 2001) and diffusion-\n\ncontrolled (Raven et al., 1998; Fuller et al., 1993) mechanisms played the main role on As \n\nsequestration by the mineral surfaces over the time. Since an anion is adsorbed in a \n\nnonexchangeable form during initial phase, it can act as sorption sites for dissolved Al and, \n\nor, Fe. This causes a decrease in the dissolved concentration of these cations at the external \n\nsolution, which along with the presence of anions in solution induce more aluminium and, \n\nor, iron to dissolve from the solid matrices. The attached Al or Fe in turns adsorbs more \n\narsenate from external solution to form a surface precipitate.

This hypothesis is based upon the time dependence \n\nwhich is well characterised in our experiment, i.e. a rapid equilibrium being attained in the \n\nsubset of surface sites located near the exterior of aggregates, as stated by Fuller et al. \n\n(1993). The ionic substitution of Al for Fe in the structure of goethite has a marked effect \n\n\n\n 39\n\non goethite properties. Variations in crystal size, shape and surface area, structural OH \n\ncontent, and dissolution behaviour were observed due to Al for Fe substitution in goethite \n\nstructure (Murad and Schwertmann, 1983; Schwertmann, 1984; Schulze and Schwertmann, \n\n1987; Torrent et al., 1987; Jeanroy et al., 1991). \n\nFor the smaller solid:solution ratio, 2.0 g L-1, As(V) adsorption was over 94 % during \n\nthe time frame. The increase in solid concentration affected arsenic removal by most \n\nadsorbents, especially, Gt and Hm, which efficiencies were depleted from ?98 and ?95 % \nto ?70 and ?78 %, respectively (Figures 1a and 1b). The decrease in adsorption density was \nconsistent with visual observation that clearly indicated increasingly aggregation of goethite \n\nparticles at higher solid concentrations. Although no visual aggregation was verified for the \n\nother adsorbents, we suppose that this phenomenon might have also happened, limiting \n\nAs(V) adsorption at higher solid concentrations. \n\n \n\n3.3. As(V) Adsorption Envelopes. Changes in the pH affected the sorption process \n\nof As(V) anions by Al and Fe (hydr)oxides (Figure 4), as widely reported in the literature \n\n(Anderson et al., 1976; Pierce and Moore, 1982; Manning and Goldberg, 1997; Lafferty \n\nand Loeppert, 2005; Garcia-Sanchez et al., 2002; Deschamps et al., 2003; Masue et al., \n\n2007). In general maximum adsorption was obtained at pH range from 3.5 up to 5.5. Under \n\nsuch conditions, the monovalent anion (H2AsO4\n- ) is the dominant species. This implies that \n\nAs(V) adsorption may be described by surface complexation models involving ligand \n\nexchange of surface hydroxyl groups, mainly with the surface OH2 rather than surface OH \n\ngroups. Low pH causes protonation of \u2013OH-1/2 groups to OH2\n+1/2, which facilitate the ligand \n\nexchange since H2O is easier to detach from metal binding sites than OH (McBride, 1994). \n\nIn this case the dissociation of H+ from H3AsO4 also is considered to contribute to both, the \n\nprotonation of surface OH groups and the increase of negatively charged adsorbate \n\n(H2AsO4\n-). These effects, however, are counterbalanced by the decrease in the net positive \n\ncharge as the pH increases to the point of zero charge (pHPZC).  \n\nIn general, the adsorption envelope followed a similar trend, indicating similar \n\narsenate adsorption mechanism for all materials. It is worth of note, a more pronounced \n\ndecrease in As(V) retention as the pH approaches to the second pK of the arsenic acid \n\n(pKa2 = 6.9).

Data are \nrepresented as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean (n = 3); bars not visible are smaller \nthan symbol \n\n \n\n \n\nconditioning the pHPZC to a lower value. For example, Anderson et al. (1976) observed that \n\nthe pHPZC of aluminium hydroxides decreased from 8.5 to 4.6 after loaded with arsenate. \n\nFor ferrihydrite, Jain et al. (1999) reported a decrease of 2.4 pH unit, from 8.5 to 6.1. A \n\nsimilar observation was reported by Ladeira and Ciminelli (2004) for goethite and gibbsite. \n\nThis behaviour is also expected to other iron (hydr)oxides due to arsenate adsorption. \n\nThereby, the decrease in arsenate adsorption as the pH rises can be due to two interacting \n\nfactors: the decrease of positive net surface charge and the attachment of adsorbate which \n\ncreates additional negative surface charges inducing repulsion of As(V) anions in the \n\nexternal solution and increasingly occupy available sites for adsorption. \n\n \n\n4. CONCLUSIONS \n\nThe results clearly show that incorporation of structural Al into goethite minerals \n\nincreases arsenate adsorption capacity. AlGts presented As(V) adsorption capacities almost \n\n\n\n 41\n\n4 times higher than pure goethite. Arsenate adsorption onto Al and Fe (hydr)oxides is \n\nstrongly influenced by pH, in a such way that maximum adsorption is achieved at slightly \n\nacidic conditions. Arsenate retention patterns suggested formation of stable, probably inner-\n\nsphere binuclear complexes, involving ligand exchange with the OH2 groups. \n\nNotwithstanding, further spectroscopic studies are warranted to certificate the type of \n\nsurface complexes are preferentially formed between As(V) and Al-substituted goethites. \n\nIn spite of the preference for iron in water treatment processes, aluminium \n\n(hydr)oxides revealed to be more efficient in adsorbing soluble As(V). Maximum \n\nadsorption of arsenate was higher on poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 than on ferrihydrite. \n\nSimilarly, gibbsite presented higher As(V) adsorption than hematite or goethite. Al-\n\nsubstituted goethites showed intermediate adsorption efficiency and can be considered \n\npromising materials to remove arsenic from contaminated water. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 42\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5.

In anoxic environment dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria plays a \nfundamental role in catalysing the redox transformations that ultimately control the \nmobility of As in aquatic environment. Thus, we investigated the stability of arsenic \nretained by aluminium and iron (hydr)oxides under anoxic conditions in the presence of \nShawanella putrefaciens cells, and phosphate or carbonate as competing anions. As(V) \nloaded samples of synthetic hematite (Hm), goethite (Gt), 2-line ferrihydrite (Fh), gibbsite \n(Gb), aluminium hydroxide [Al(OH)3], and three Al-substituted goethites containing 13, 20, \nand 23 cmol mol-1 of Al (AlGt13, AlGt20, and AlGt23, respectively) were anaerobically \nincubated under N2 atmosphere and periodically sampled to evaluate the contents of soluble \nAs in the supernatants. It was found that S. putrefaciens cells were able to bind on mineral \nsurfaces and utilise both noncrystalline and crystalline iron (hydr)oxides as electron \nacceptor releasing arsenic into solution. Al-substituted goethites presented a decrease in the \nfraction of soluble iron and mobilised arsenic as structural Al increased. The expected \nrelationship between specific surface area and reductive dissolution of Fe and As was also \naffected by the increment in structural Al. Phosphate and carbonate affected the kinetics of \niron reduction due to precipitation of soluble iron as metastable mineral phases (e.g. \nvivianite and siderite). It seems that analogous mineral phases of phosphates served as a \nsink for As limiting its mobilisation. Phosphate competed strongly with arsenate and its \nefficiency seemed to be governed by the nature of the binding mechanism between As and \nadsorbent surface. Higher fraction of arsenic was desorbed by phosphate from gibbsite \nfollowed by AlGts. Conversely, only Gb showed significant amounts of arsenate displaced \nby carbonate. In spite of low crystallinity, Al(OH)3 was the most efficient in retaining \narsenate on its surface followed by Fh and Hm. \n\n \nKeywords: biological reduction, arsenate, phosphate, carbonate, Al-substituted \n\ngoethite, Al and Fe hydroxides. \n \n\n\n\n 49\n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\nArsenic contamination is an environmental, ecological and health concern. Due to \n\nnew evidences of its carcinogenic effect, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has \n\nrecommended to reduce the maximum arsenic level from 50 to 10 ?g L-1 in drinking water. \nThis regulatory limit has been adopted by many countries. Therefore, development of new \n\ntechnologies for arsenic removal from water has currently been a challenge to researchers \n\nworldwide. The input of arsenic in the environment is attributed to natural and \n\nanthropogenic sources which are related to weathering of As-bearing rocks, leakage of As-\n\nrich thermal waters to shallow aquifers, mining and smelting activity, pesticides and wood \n\npreservative uses, as well as its use as growth promoter for animals (Matschullat, 2000; \n\nSmedley and Kinniburg, 2002). \n\nIn aquatic environment arsenic can be found as inorganic and organic compounds, in \n\nseveral valence states, i.e. -3, -1, 0, +3, and +5. In natural water arsenic occurs mainly in \n\ninorganic forms as trivalent arsenite [As(III)] (as H3AsO3) or pentavalent arsenate [As(V)] \n\n(as H2AsO4\n- and HAsO4\n\n2-). In addition, in marine waters and lakes arsenic can undergo \n\nmicrobial methylation and both As(III) and As(V) can coexist with monomethilarsonic acid \n\n(MMA), and dimethilarsinic acid (DMA). Furthermore, redox potential (Eh) and pH control \n\nthe distribution of arsenic species (e.g. H3AsO4/H2AsO4\n- pKa1 = 2.2; H2AsO4\n\n-/HAsO4\n2- pKa2 \n\n= 6.9; HAsO4\n2-/AsO4\n\n3- pKa3 = 11.4). As(III) is expected to be the dominant species in \n\nanoxic conditions, but because of relatively slow transformation on the redox conditions, \n\nboth species, As(III) or As(V), can be often found in either redox environment. \n\nThe aluminium and iron (hydr)oxides are ubiquitous reactive constituents of soil, \n\nsediments and aquifers. Due to high reactivity they play a fundamental role on the \n\nbiogeochemical cycle of many elements (e.g. P, S, As, Pb, etc.). For this reason, the \n\ndistribution of arsenic is mostly controlled by both, Al and Fe (hydr)oxides, in most \n\noxidised environment, and the main technologies to remove arsenic from contaminated \n\nwater are based on coagulation/precipitation or adsorption processes involving aluminium \n\nor ferric compounds. General experience has shown that aluminium salts are less efficient \n\nthan ferric ones to remove arsenic from water. McNeil and Edwards (1997) reported that \n\nwhen ferric coagulants are added at water treatment plants, most of the Fe3+ precipitates as \n\ninsoluble ferric hydroxide. In aluminium precipitation, however, a significant portion of the \n\n\n\n 50\n\nadded Al3+ remains as soluble complexes. Then, because only particulate metal hydroxides \n\ncan mediate arsenic removal, alum plants must carefully consider aluminium solubility \n\nwhen arsenic removal is required in water treatment plants.  \n\nAlthough ferric compounds have lower solubility in relation to aluminium ones, they \n\nare unstable under low Eh conditions. In the absence of oxygen, Fe(III) minerals can be \n\nused as electron acceptor during microbial respiration (Lovley et al., 2004). In this process, \n\nbacteria coupled hydrogen and organic carbon oxidation to the reduction of Fe(III). \n\nTherefore, based on the association between many trace element and Fe(III) (hydr)oxides, \n\nand the tendency of these minerals to be dissolved under suboxic conditions, biological iron \n\nreduction can have a major impact on the persistence and mobility of toxic elements, \n\nradionuclides, and organic contaminants under such conditions (Lovley et al., 1993; \n\nCummings et al., 1999; Zachara et al., 2001). Cummings et al. (1999) investigating the \n\nbiological reduction of synthetic scorodite (FeAsO4 .2H2O), encountered that dissimilatory \n\nFe reduction resulted in releasing of As(V) and Fe(II) into solution. Slower rate of \n\nreductive dissolution (chemical or microbiological) in the presence of Al substituting Fe in \n\nthe iron (hydr)oxides structure was reported by Schwertmann (1984), Jeanroy et al. (1991), \n\nand reference therein. Torrent et al. (1987) observed that Al substitution depressed the \n\nreductive dissolution of synthetic goethite and hematite by dithionite/citrate/bicarbonate \n\nsolution. Bousserrhine et al. (1999) also demonstrated that biological reduction of Al, Cr, \n\nMn, and Co-substituted goethites was decreased as substitution increased. Al-goethite was \n\nmore resistant to reductive dissolution than other substituted goethites. \n\nAbiotic processes are also thought to be related to the decoupling of Al or Fe \n\n(hydr)oxides-associated arsenic. Natural attenuation of arsenic by adsorption on these \n\nminerals may be also limited due to competing oxyanions, in which one anion will \n\nnormally be competing for the sorption sites (Hongshao and Stanforth, 2001; Sahai et al., \n\n2007; Zang et al., 2008). Due to similar acid dissociation constants phosphate (pKa1 = 2.1, \n\npKa2 = 7.2, \n pKa3 = 12.3) behaves much like arsenate (pKa1 = 2.2, pKa2 = 6.9, \n\n pKa3 = 11.4). \n\nIn addition to phosphate, carbonate may also, to a lesser extent, limit the arsenate sorption \n\nreactions. The displacement of adsorbed As with dissolved carbonate was recently \n\nexamined theoretically by Appelo et al. (2002), and this mechanism was proposed to be \n\npotentially one of the major reasons for high As concentrations in groundwater. Thus, it is \n\n\n\n 51\n\nworthwhile to investigate the adsorption and replacement of one anion from mineral \n\nparticles by another. In addition, investigations of the competition between the anions can \n\nprovide insight into the reactions occurring on the surface (Hongshao and Stanforth, 2001). \n\nBy associating the higher binding affinity of Fe (hydr)oxides for arsenic and the \n\nhigher stability of Al under anoxic conditions can be an advantageous alternative for \n\nremoving arsenic from water. Few studies have focused on As sorption processes onto or \n\nAs release by reductive dissolution of Al-substituted Fe (hydr)oxides. Masue et al. (2007) \n\nreported a decrease in both coprecipitated As(III) and As(V) adsorption onto \n\naluminium:iron hydroxides as the Al:Fe molar ratio increased. Furthermore, desorption of \n\nAs by phosphate competing ion was favoured by the increase of Al:Fe ratio. In view of \n\nthese statement, the aim of this work was to investigate the decoupling of arsenate from Al-\n\nsubstituted goethites and other synthetic Al and Fe (hydr)oxides influenced by dissimilatory \n\niron reduction  and competing anions. \n\n \n\n2. MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n2.1. Synthesis of Al and Fe (Hydr)oxides \n\nHematite (Hm), Goethite (Gt), and 2-line Ferrihydrite (Fh) were synthesised by \n\nneutralizing Fe(NO3)3 solution with KOH following the procedure outlined by \n\nSchwertmann and Cornell (2000). A series of aluminium substituted goethite with different \n\nAl:Fe ratios (15:50, 25:50, 35:50 v/v) was synthesised followed the methods therein. Al-\n\nsubstituted goethites were synthesized from ferrous and aluminium chloride solutions by \n\nprecipitation with potassium hydroxides and aged in a plastic bottle during 90 days. Slow \n\noxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ and incorporation of Al in the goethite structure were achieved by \n\nopening the bottle daily and stirring the suspensions vigorously during 5 minutes. In order \n\nto remove the excess of Al, precipitates were washed twice with 0.01 mol L-1 KOH \n\nsolution, several times with Milli-Q water, centrifuged, and dried at 50 oC at an oven with \n\nair circulation. To remove the excess of electrolyte, precipitates of Fe (hydr)oxides were \n\nalso washed several times with Milli-Q water until achieving minimum electrical \n\nconductivity. Samples were then centrifuged and dried at 50 oC at an oven with air \n\ncirculation, except for Ferrihydrite which was freeze-dried. \n\n\n\n 52\n\nGibbsite (Gb) was prepared following the procedures outlined in Kyle et al. (1975). \n\nAn Al(NO3)3 solution was titrated with 4 mol L\n-1 NaOH solution to a pH of 4.6 \u00b1 0.2. The \n\ngelatinous precipitate was heated for two hours at 40 oC, then washed twice, dialyzed with \n\nMilli-Q water for 36 days and dried at 50 oC. The poorly crystalline aluminium hydroxide \n\n[Al(OH)3] was also prepared from an aluminium nitrate solution by precipitation with 4 \n\nmol L-1 NaOH solution. The procedure was similar to that followed for the synthesis of \n\ngibbsite, but with the suppression of the heating step to preserve low crystallinity. Similarly \n\nto ferrihydrite, the aluminium hydroxide was freeze-dried in order to prevent its \n\ncrystallization. \n\nThe specific surface area was determined by multipoint BET analyses with N2 as \n\nadsorbent (Quantachrome model NOVA 1000). Particle size distribution was obtained from \n\na laser analyser (Micromeritics Saturn Digisizer model 5200), respectively (Table 1). \n\n \n\n2.2. As(V) Loaded Adsorbents. One gram of the adsorbents were loaded with \n\narsenate from a 10 mmol L-1 CaCl2 solution containing As(V) concentrations in a 250 mL \n\npolypropylene centrifuge tubes. Such concentrations were added to achieve the maximum \n\nadsorption capacity for each adsorbent, according to Silva et al. (2008). The pH was \n\nadjusted to 5.0 \u00b10.2 and the suspensions were equilibrated in a horizontal shaker during one \n\nweek. The tubes were then centrifuged (3000 rpm, 30 min.), the supernatants filtered \n\nthrough 0.22 ?m membrane filters (Millipore Millex-GV, USA), and storage for As \nanalyses. The remaining solid phases were freeze-dried and stored for further incubation \n\nexperiments. The amount of As(V) adsorbed was calculated by the difference between the \n\ninitial and final As concentration in supernatants (Table 1). Checks containing arsenic in \n\nsolution but no adsorbent material were used to measure the amount of arsenic adsorbed by \n\nthe walls of the reaction vessels. \n\n \n\n2.3. Bacterial Culture and Growth Medium. Cultures of Shawanella putrefaciens \n\nwere obtained from Australian Collection of Microorganism at The University of \n\nQueensland. Bacteria were growth aerobically during 18 h to attain the log phase, and \n\nroutinely cultured at 37 oC in sterile peptone yeast extract medium containing 10 g L-1 \n\npeptone, 5 g L-1 yeast, and 5 g L-1 NaCl at pH 7.2.  \n\n\n\n 53\n\nTable 1 \u2013 Surface area (SA), mean particle size (MPS), and adsorbed arsenic (Asadsorb.) of \nthe different aluminium and ferric compounds.

The medium was extensively purged with high-\n\npurity N2 and autoclaved at 121 \noC during 20 min. \n\n \n\n2.4. Incubation Experiments. In order to investigate the influence of dissimilatory \n\niron reduction and the presence of competing anion on arsenic release from different As-\n\nloaded Al and Fe (hydr)oxides, a series of incubation experiments was carried out.  \n\n \n\n2.4.1. Dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction. As-loaded adsorbents (0.2000 g) were \n\nequilibrated with 96 mL of the sterile basal medium and 4.0 mL of S. putrefaciens cell \n\nsuspension in a 125 mL screw cap plastic bottle. The mixture was buffered at pH 7.0 by \n\nadding 10 mmol L-1 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid (PIPES). Then, the suspensions \n\nwere purged with high-purity N2 and anaerobically incubated in a glovebox for about 500 h. \n\nTo investigate the possible influence of adsorbed arsenic in the bacterial activity, it was \n\nalso carried out an assay with no As-loaded adsorbents. \n\n \n\n\n\n 54\n\n2.4.2. Influence of competing anions. In order to investigate the effects of phosphate \n\nand carbonate on arsenic release under anaerobic conditions, two parallel experiments were \n\ncarried out. Both were performed at the same conditions of the preceding experiment \n\n(section 2.4.1), with As-loaded adsorbents in the presence of S putrefaciens. The only \n\ndifference was the addition of 5.0 mmol L-1 of phosphate (as KH2PO4) or 30 mmol L\n-1 of \n\ncarbonate (as NaHCO3) in the basal medium, as competing anions. In the latter experiment \n\nNaHCO3 substituted the PIPES solution as pH buffer, lactate was supplied at 10 mmol L\n-1, \n\nand As-loaded adsorbents at 1.0 g L-1.  \n\nFor all experiments checks were also carried out with no cell suspension. Aliquots \n\nwere periodically taken, filtered through 0.22 ?m membrane filters (Millipore Millex-GV, \nUSA), acidified and stored for further analyses of Al, As, Fe, and P. The total volume of the \n\naliquots did not exceed 10 % of the initial volume. \n\nAll chemical used were reagent grade and water was purified through a Milli-Q \n\nsystem. All cell additions, transferring, and culture samplings were performed with sterile \n\nsyringe or pipette tips previously flushed with high-purity N2. All assays were carried out in \n\ntriplicates. \n\n \n\n2.5. Analytical Techniques. Soluble Al, As, Fe, and P contents in the aliquots were \n\nmeasured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), using a \n\nPerkin Elmer Optima 3300 DV. Scandium was used as internal standard to correct for \n\ninstrumental instabilities and matrix effect. Solution of this element was added to the \n\naliquots to reach a final concentration of 44.5 \u00b5mol L-1. Typical detection limits (3?) of 0.42 \n\u00b5mol L-1 were obtained for As.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3. Results and Discussion.  \n\n3.1. Reduction of Fe(III) and Arsenic release. Contents of Al, As and Fe in solution \n\nwere negligible in the control experiments, suggesting no As release due to Fe reduction at \n\nthe absence of bacterial cell suspensions (data not shown). Initial low concentrations of Al \n\n(0.05 mmol L-1 and 0.075 mmol L-1 for gibbsite and poorly crystalline aluminium \n\nhydroxide, respectively) and As (&lt;1,6 ?mol L-1, for all of adsorbents) were ascribed to \n\n\n\n 55\n\ndissolution-desorption equilibrium during the time period to set up the experiment (ca. 12 \n\nh). This result may be due to the relative high ionic strength (I=0.0252) of the basal \n\nmedium, increasing the likelihood of the anion exchange. Thus, those initial concentrations \n\nwere subtracted from further data to express solely effects associated to dissimilatory \n\nreduction. \n\nIncreases in soluble Fe was interpreted as dissimilatory reduction occurred for Fe(III) \n\n(hydr)oxides, indicating that they were able to support bacterial growth as electron \n\nacceptor, independent of the crystallinity or Al-substitution (Figure 1). All Fe(III) \n\n(hydr)oxides were partially reduced by bacteria, but the iron reduction rates were decreased \n\nfor the As-loaded adsorbents (Figure 1b) in relation to no As-loaded ones (Figure 1a). For \n\ninstance, higher percentages of reduced iron were obtained for AlGt13, AlGt20, and AlGt23 \n\nwithout adsorbed arsenic which achieved respectively 12.8, 11.5, and 11.30 % in \n\ncomparison with 8.1, 7.3, and 7.2 % observed in the presence of adsorbed arsenic. \n\nAdditionally, Fe(II) production started earlier (&lt;48 h) in the absence of adsorbed As and \n\njust after 96 h of incubation time in its presence. These results indicate that adsorbed As not \n\nonly delays, but also constrains the bacterial activity. The effect of arsenic on the bacterial \n\nactivity can be better observed by the clear difference in iron reduction pattern for Fh \n\n(Figure 1a, and b). We evoked two hypotheses to explain this effect: (1) the toxicity of As \n\nper se to the bacterial cells; and (2) electrostatic repulsion between As-loaded (hydr)oxides \n\nand bacterial cells. The second hypothesis consider that S. putrefaciens cells present \n\nnegative net charge at pH ? 4 (Claessens et al., 2004) and then they could easily attach to \nthe positive surface of the iron (hydr)oxides at the conditions of this investigation (pH ? \n7.0), as the point of zero charge (pHPZC) is about 8-8.5 for most (hydr)oxides. Nevertheless, \n\nit is well known that specific adsorption of anions, e.g. phosphate or arsenate, modifies the \n\nmineral surfaces decreasing the pHPZC up to four pH units (Arai and Sparks, 2001). Thus, \n\nby decreasing the pHPZC adsorbed As would promote increases in the negative charge on \n\nthe iron (hydr)oxide surfaces leading to electrostatic repulsion between bacterial cells and \n\nFe(III) colloids.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 56\n\n0 48 96 144 192 240 288 336 384 432 480 528\n\nF\ne \n\n(m\nm\n\nol\n L\n\n-1\n)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nFe\nAs\n\n0 48 96 144 192 240 288 336 384 432 480 528\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nFe\nAs\n\n0 48 96 144 192 240 288 336 384 432 480 528\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nFe\nAs\n\n0 48 96 144 192 240 288 336 384 432 480 528\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nFe\nAs\n\n0 48 96 144 192 240 288 336 384 432 480 528\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nFe\nAs\n\n0 48 96 144 192 240 288 336 384 432 480 528\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nFe\nAs\n\nA\ns (?\n\nm\nol L\n\n-1)\n\nHematite Goethite\n\nAlGt13Ferrihydrite\n\nAlGt23AlGt20\n\nTime (h)\n\n0 48 96 144 192 240 288 336 384 432 480 528\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nHm \nGt \nFh \nAlGt13 \n\nAlGt20 \n\nAlGt23 \n\nTime (h)\n\n0 48 96 144 192 240 288 336 384 432 480 528\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nHm\nGt\nFh\nAlGt13\nAlGt20\nAlGt23\n\na b\n\nc d\n\ne f\n\ng h\n\nWhitout As(V) loaded With As(V) loaded\n\n \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Fe(III) reduction and As mobilisation from different Fe (hydr)oxides incubated \nwith S. putrefaciens. Data are represented as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean (n=3); \nbars not visible are smaller than symbol \n\n\n\n 57\n\nThe presence of aluminium in the goethite structure limited the iron reduction rate, \n\nthereby, the Fe(II) concentrations were smaller as structural Al increased. This finding is in \n\nline with previous results (Schwertmann, 1984; Jeanroy et al., 1991; Boussarine et al., \n\n1999), but diverges from data reported by Boussarine et al. (1999) concerning to Al \n\nsolubilisation. According to these authors Al dissolution was congruent with Fe reduction \n\nfrom Al-substituted goethites which was not observed during the course of our experiment \n\n(data not shown). Such difference can be ascribed to distinct experimental conditions. The \n\nacidic medium (pH = 3.4) obviously conditioned Al solubilisation in the experiment \n\nperformed by Boussarine et al. (1999). Under our experimental condition (pH ? 7.0) the \nAl3+ activity is rather low and Al(OH)3\n\n\u00b0\n is expected to be the dominating soluble species, \n\naccording to Lindsay (1979). Anyway, surface passivation can be ascribed to Al \n\nprecipitates on the Al-goethite surfaces restraining its reductive dissolution as argued by \n\nKakkudapu et al. (2001).  \n\nAs a general observation it can be considered two different patterns for arsenic \n\nmobilisation: first, mobilisation of arsenic from well crystallized iron (hydr)oxides (Gt and \n\nHm) was delayed in relation to Fe reduction (Figure 1c, and d). Second, a congruent release \n\nof As with Fe reduction from poorly crystallised Fh, and Al-substituted goethites (Figure \n\n1e, f, g, and h). Such results suggest preferential mobilisation of Fe not associated with \n\nadsorbed As at the initial stages of the reductive dissolution of well crystallised Hm and Gt. \n\nOn the other hand, iron dissolution from poorly crystallised Fh gave rise to a prompt As \n\nmobilisation which increased up to approximately 100 ?mol L-1 during roughly 400 h of \nincubation time (Figure 1e). The amounts of arsenic mobilised from Al-substituted \n\ngoethites were much lower than for Fh and decreased as the structural Al increased (Figure \n\n1f, g, and h). This behaviour concurs and perhaps is associated with higher specific surface \n\narea and As adsorption capacity for Fh in relation to Hm and Gt (Table 1). Concerning to \n\nthese aspects, Al-substituted goethites exhibited an intermediate behaviour between well \n\nand poorly crystalline Fe (hydr)oxides.  \n\nAlthough goethite and hematite had shown the lowest final concentrations of soluble \n\narsenic, roughly 5 and 10 ?mol L-1, respectively, an opposite trend is depicted when the \ndata are expressed as percentage of the initial content of Fe(III) and As in the solid phase. \n\nBy considering the Asmobilised/Astotal ratio as a function of Fereleased or Asmobilised/Astotal ratio \n\n\n\n 58\n\nas a function of Fereleased/Fetotal ratio (Figure 2a, and b), it can be observed that the lowest \n\npercentage of both Fe dissolution and arsenic mobilisation for AlGt23, followed by AlGt20. \n\nHematite, Goethite, and AlGt13 presented values quite similar, whilst Fh remained with the \n\nhighest amount of iron and arsenic released, almost 20 % and 5 %, respectively. These \n\nresults reflect that aluminium markedly enhanced the stability of the goethites face to \n\ndissimilatory iron reducing.  \n\nThe expected relationship between surface area and Fe dissolution or arsenic \n\nmobilisation was not observed. When normalised to specific surface area, comparable \n\nfractions of Fereleased/Fetotal were observed for Gt, Hm, and AlGt13 (Figure 2c). Increment of \n\nstructural aluminium reflected in lower fraction of reduced Fe, even though, Al-goethites \n\npresent similar surface area. Thus, the difference in Fe solubilisation should be attributed to \n\nvariations in crystal properties due to Al substitution, other than specific surface area. \n\nAdditionally, as the direct contact between bacteria and (hydr)oxides surfaces is considered \n\na rate determining step for iron reduction (Liu et al. 2001), the presence of Al sites on the \n\ncrystal surfaces could have inhibited the electron shuttle between Al-goethite surfaces and \n\ncell membranes. This is based on fact that bacteria probably are not able to distinguish \n\nactive Al or Fe charge sites, binding on either. Then, the likelihood of bacterial membrane \n\nto be bound with Al sites instated of Fe ones should be higher as structural Al increases. \n\nThe fraction of dissolved arsenic as a function of specific surface area mirrored the \n\nbehaviour for iron, except to Al-substituted goethites (Figure 2c). Difference in the \n\nfractions of dissolved arsenic from Al-goethites was not observed, suggesting that \n\nmobilised arsenic could to a certain extent be readsorbed by Al reactive sites on the Al-\n\ngoethite surfaces. This hypothesis is in line with the findings of Mello et al. (2006). These \n\nauthors suggested that arsenic mobilised by reductive dissolution of iron (hydr)oxides may \n\nbe readsorbed by gibbsite in As-rich soils submitted to anaerobic incubation. \n\n \n\n\n\n 59\n\nFereleased (mmol L\n-1)\n\n0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5\n\nA\ns m\n\nob\nil\n\nis\ned\n\n/A\ns t\n\not\nal\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\nAlGt23\nAlGt20\nAlGt13\nHm\nGt\nFh\n\nFereleased/Fetotal (%)\n\n5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 22.5 25.0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\nAlGt23\nAlGt20\nAlGt13\nHm\nGt\nFh\n\na b\n\nSpecific surface area (m2 g-1)\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\n\nA\ns m\n\nob\nil\n\nis\ned\n\n/A\ns t\n\not\nal\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nF\ne r\n\nel\nea\n\nse\nd\n\n/F\ne t\n\not\nal\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\nFe\nAs\n\nc\n\n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Reduction of Fe(III) and mobilisation of arsenic from different Fe (hydr)oxides. \na, relationship between the fraction of mobilised As and Fe release; b, relationship \nbetween the fraction of mobilised As and the fraction of Fe reduced; and c, the fraction of \nmobilised As and reduced Fe from Gt (?, ?), Hm ( , ), AlGt23 ( , ?), AlGt20 (?, ), \nAlGt13 ( , ), and Fh (?, ?) plotted against specific surface area.

Data are represented as means \u00b1 standard error of \nthe mean (n = 3); bars not visible are smaller than symbol \n\n\n\n 61\n\ndesorption can also be considered. By comparing these results with the data from the \n\npreceding section, it can be seem that As was early released here, at the start of the \n\nexperiment. This initial release of As can be ascribed to exchange by competing phosphate \n\nequilibrium, as no Fe reduction is expected at the beginning of the experiment.  \n\nIt is worth of note that initial P immobilisation was higher, almost 30 %, in the \n\nsuspensions containing poorly crystalline (hydr)oxides [Fh and Al(OH)3] and Al-\n\nsubstituted goethites. Taking into account that all adsorbents were submitted to similar \n\nexperimental conditions, i.e. equal concentrations of Ca and P added to the medium, P \n\nimmobilisation due to Ca-P precipitation should rigorously be the same for all adsorbents. \n\nThen, additional amount of P immobilised for Fh, Al(OH)3, and AlGts in relation to well \n\ncrystalline (hydr)oxides can be ascribed to P adsorption. It should also be considered that \n\narsenic was loaded at near maximum adsorption capacity and that P was supplied at \n\nconcentrations (5 mmol L-1) sufficient to ensure a large excess with respect to total \n\nadsorbed arsenic. Anyway, amounts of desorbed As does not explain the excess of P \n\nimmobilised in suspensions of poorly crystalline (hydr)oxides in relation to well crystalline \n\nones. Therefore, it should be considered P adsorption at additional sites not occupied by \n\nAs(V). In fact, previous investigations have shown that surface coverage in the competitive \n\nadsorption experiments is higher than the adsorption of the individual ions (Hongshao and \n\nStanforth, 2001; Zhang and Selim, 2008) suggesting that there are some specific sites for \n\neach ion as well as other sites that can adsorb both ions (Manning and Goldberg, 1996b). \n\nLater, after 12 h (second measurement), the fraction of phosphate immobilised \n\ndecreased to achieve a steady-state by 144 h for those adsorbents to which no significant \n\niron release was observed, i.e. hematite, goethite, gibbsite, and poorly crystalline Al(OH)3. \n\nThis indicates remobilisation of phosphate probably from those metastable precipitated \n\nphases previously referred. The late steady-state equilibrium, however, was not observed \n\nfor poorly crystalline Fh and Al-substituted goethites (Figure 3). On the contrary, there is a \n\nclear increase in the fraction of immobilised phosphate for these minerals after 144 h which \n\nin general coincides with a peak of soluble iron, notably for Fh. This suggests further \n\nprecipitation of Fe(II)-P phases, as indicated by Visual Minteq\u00ae software. Theoretical equilibrium \ncalculation revealed that vivianite [Fe(II)3(PO4)2 8H2O] precipitates at Fe(II) concentration \n\n\n\n 62\n\nhigher than 10-3 mmol L-1 in the presence of phosphate at 5 mmol L-1, under our experimental \n\nconditions. \n\nFormation of vivianite can also be responsible for the surprisingly low concentration \n\nof soluble iron under anaerobic conditions, as also addressed by Burnol et al. (2007). \n\nConcentrations of soluble iron, as a result of biological reduction of the iron (hydr)oxides, \n\nwere much lower in the experiment with phosphate (Figure 3) in relation to the previous \n\nexperiment (section 3.1). Even for well crystalline Hm and Gt, precipitation of vivianite can \n\nbe argued to explain the differences between experiments. Concentrations of soluble iron \n\nwere about 0.02 mmol L-1 for Hm and 0.07 mmol L-1 for Gt that corresponds to respectively \n\n140 and 40 times lesser than in the previous experiment, but still oversaturated with \n\nrespected to vivianite. Alternatively, surface coverage of the adsorbents increased by P \n\nadsorption restricting the binding of (hydr)oxide surfaces on the S. putrefaciens cells can \n\nalso be considered, as discussed earlier for arsenic.  \n\nThe pattern of P immobilisation in the treatments without arsenate (Figure 4) was \n\nsimilar, but generally greater than in the treatments with loaded arsenic adsorbents. \n\nDifferences should be attributed to higher adsorption of P at the absence of As(V). The \n\ngreatest difference was verified to poorly crystalline Al hydroxides where P immobilisation \n\nincreased from roughly 30 % in the presence of As(V) to almost 80 % in the absence of \n\nAs(V). For Fh the initial difference was from nearly 30 to 50 %, and lower to AlGts \n\nfollowed by well crystalline Gb, Gt, and Hm, roughly corresponding to the amount of \n\navailable adsorption sites, as measured by specific surface area or maximum As adsorption \n\ncapacity. \n\nSimilar arsenic desorption trends were observed for all materials. The fraction of \n\ndesorbed arsenic decreased in the following order: Gb ? AlGts > Gt > Hm > Fh > Al(OH)3. \n\nThe arsenic release initiated readily after the addition of phosphate (?4 h), increasing \nquickly up to 48 h and trended to slowed down thereafter (Figure 3). For example, nearly \n\n70 % of the total of As solubilised from goethite was reached by 48 h. Considering that \n\nsoluble iron was not detected during the initial interval (4 \u2013 48 h), the arsenic displacement \n\nmay be exclusively attributed to ligand exchange reactions with phosphate. Expressive \n\namounts of As were released from gibbsite and Al-substituted goethites, in general more than \n\n50 % within the time frame. This should integrally be attributed to exchange by phosphate \n\n\n\n 63\n\non Gb surface, but for AlGts part of the released amount must be attributed to biological \n\niron reduction. Al-substituted goethites followed similar kinetics, and the fraction of \n\nmobilised arsenic was higher as the structural Al increased (Figure 3, AlGt13, AlGt20, and \n\nAlGt23). Such weak retention of arsenic on the Al sites, except for poorly crystalline \n\nAl(OH)3, suggest formation of unstable surface complex related to surface precipitation of \n\narsenic on these adsorbents. Notwithstanding, spectroscopic investigation is warranted to \n\nfurther elucidate the type of surface complexes formed between As and these matrixes. \n\nAlthough less impressive, our data are in line with Masue et al. (2007) that reported \n\nincreasingly As(V) desorption by phosphate from poorly crystalline Al-Fe hydroxides as \n\nthe Al:Fe ratio increased, reaching to almost total arsenate desorption from pure Al \n\nhydroxide after 24 h. That difference can be ascribed to the much higher P:As (7500:1) \n\nratio used by those authors. \n\nThe relatively low amounts of As desorbed by phosphate from crystalline iron \n\n(hydr)oxides that we observed agree with results from Hongshao and Stanforth (2001), and \n\nsuggest that arsenate is adsorbed mainly as nonexchangeable ion, but there were a minor \n\nfraction exchangeable by phosphate. In fact, As(V) or P adsorption kinetics are considered \n\na two-phase reaction, with a rapid initial step followed by a much slower reaction (Torrent \n\net al., 1992; Hongshao and Stanforth, 2001). According to Hongshao and Stanforth (2001), \n\nthe nonexchangeable fraction comprises the amount of ions initially adsorbed in the first \n\nstep, and the exchangeable fraction corresponds to a surface precipitation on the adsorbed \n\nlayer. Additionally, there is a fraction of the surface sites that are very rapidly occupied but \n\nwhich are not exchangeable once occupied. Phosphate and arsenate are adsorbed equally at \n\nlow surface coverages, but arsenate forms a less soluble precipitate than does phosphate. \n\nTherefore, phosphate adsorption does not achieve the same surface coverage when added \n\nafter arsenate.  \n\nThe fraction of arsenic desorbed from Fh and Hm were quite similar, close to 26 %, \n\nbut it reached almost 37 % from Gt. Nevertheless, it seems that exchange reactions not \n\nceased after 456 h for Hm (Figure 3). A distinct behaviour was observed for Fh where the \n\namount of arsenic released reached its maximum about 192 h and suddenly dropped off to \n\nalmost zero. This depletion of soluble arsenic coincided to P immobilisation due to \n\nvivianite precipitation, as stated earlier. However, unlike P, As immobilisation can not be \n\n\n\n 64\n\nascribed to an Fe(II)-As phase precipitation, as indicated by theoretical calculation. But, as \n\nphosphate behaves much like arsenate, it can be argued to As co-precipitation with \n\nvivianite. This hypothesis is feasible considering the structure of As(V) and P minerals, \n\nwhere typical tetrahedral anions [XO4]\n3- are bound to octahedrally coordinated transition \n\nmetal ions. Variations and multiples of this bonding pattern tend to create relatively open \n\nstructures that allow for extensive substitution of cations, anions, anions groups, and water \n\n(O\u2019Day, 2006). Consequently, the precipitation of Fe(II)-P phases could act as sink for \n\narsenic giving rise to a vivianite-like mineral {Fe(II)3[(As, P)O4]2.8H2O}. This observation \n\nhas a great environmental implication to the fate of As in eutrophic-reducing aquatic \n\nsystems.  \n\nAluminium hydroxide was by far the most efficient in retaining arsenic on its surface. \n\nLess than 15 % of the Astotal were desorbed by phosphate. Arsenate adsorption kinetic data \n\nfor Al(OH)3 revealed that more than 92 % of the added arsenate was adsorbed in nearly 6 h \n\n(Silva et al., 2008). In addition, nearly 66 % of phosphate added to poorly crystalline \n\nAl(OH)3 suspension was sorbed in 4 h (Figure 4), that corresponds to nearly 80 % of total P \n\nimmobilised after 456 h. Phosphate adsorbed later (20%) is comparable to the fraction of \n\nAs desorbed by competing P (15 %). Thus, considering that adsorption kinetic is related to \n\nexchangeability of P and As ions, as pointed out earlier, our data indicate comparable \n\namounts of specific sites for adsorption of P and As in the initial phase. Then, it may be \n\ninferred that the majority of As is adsorbed on poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 surface as a \n\nnonexchangeable phase, strongly attached and likely forming a very stable surface \n\ncomplex. \n\n \n\n3.3. Influence of carbonate as competing anion. Desorption of arsenic by carbonate \n\nfrom Al and Fe (hydr)oxides, under dissimilatory iron reduction (Figure 5a), was in general \n\ninferior to that desorbed by phosphate (Figure 3). This indicates, a lower competitive effect \n\nfor adsorption of carbonate on those surfaces, in relation to arsenate or phosphate, as \n\npreviously reported (Ghosh et al., 2005; Radu et al., 2005; Burnol et al., 2007). Radu et al. \n\n(2007) observed that carbonate mobilised less adsorbed As(V) than was mobilized by \n\nphosphate, even when present in much higher concentrations than phosphate. Exceptions \n\nfor Gb, Fh, and Gt can be ascribed to a weak surface binding mechanism of As(V) in Gb  or \n\n\n\n 65\n\nHematite\n\n0 48 96 144 192 240 288 336 384 432 480\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\nP \nFe \n\nGoethite\n\n0 48 96 144 192 240 288 336 384 432 480\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\nP \nFe \n\nFerrihydrite\n\n0 100 200 300 400\n\nP\nim\n\nob\nil\n\nis\ned\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\nAlGt13\n\n0 48 96 144 192 240 288 336 384 432 480\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nF\ne r\n\nel\nea\n\nse\nd\n\n (\nm\n\nm\nol\n\n L\n-1\n\n)\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\nAlGt20\n\n0 48 96 144 192 240 288 336 384 432 480\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\nAlGt23\n\n0 48 96 144 192 240 288 336 384 432 480\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\nGibbsite\n\nTime (h)\n\n0 48 96 144 192 240 288 336 384 432 480\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nAl(OH)3\n\nTime (h)\n\n0 48 96 144 192 240 288 336 384 432 480\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n \n\n \nFigure 4 \u2013 Fe(III) reduction and P immobilisation from different Al and Fe suspension in \n\nthe presence of S. putrefaciens.

Gibbsite also presented comparable fractions of arsenic desorbed in both presence \n\nand absence of S. putrefaciens cells, being quite similar to that removed by phosphate. This \n\nresult confirm that As(V) adsorption onto Gb surface characterises a binding mechanism \n\nweaker than to other (hydr)oxides. It is also clear that arsenic mobilisation from Gb and \n\nAlGts is primarily due to desorption by exchange with carbonate rather than to reductive \n\ndissolution, as the fraction of iron dissolved from these adsorbents (Figuere 5c) was quite \n\n\n\n 67\n\nlow (&lt;2%). On the other hand, Fh, Gt, and in a lesser extent Hm presented higher arsenic \n\nrelease in the presence of bacteria in a such way that the differences can be ascribed to the \n\nreductive dissolution of iron. The highest difference was observed to Fh which presented \n\nless than 10 % of the adsorbed arsenic released in the absence of iron reducing bacteria. \n\nThese results indicate that only 20 % of the arsenic release can be attributed to desorption \n\nby carbonate. For Gt, nearly 50 % of the arsenic release could be ascribed to that \n\nexchangeable mechanism. \n\nSoluble Fe and Al concentrations were negligible in the absence of bacteria. Only for \n\nFh and Gt, there were appreciable fractions of iron dissolved in the presence of bacteria. \n\nThermodynamics calculations indicated precipitation of siderite [Fe(II)CO3] at Fe(II) \n\nconcentration higher than 0.01 mmol L-1, under our experimental conditions. Arsenic \n\nmobilisation from Gt and Fh under anaerobic conditions was congruent with biological iron \n\nreduction reaching nearly 60 and 50 %, respectively. These amounts of arsenic released by \n\ncarbonate essay were superior to that observed to phosphate one. Although, theoretical \n\ncalculations pointed out oversaturation with respect to siderite, unlike vivianite, apparently \n\nthe metastable carbonate phases can not act as sink for soluble arsenic. \n\nThere is much spectroscopic evidence that adsorbed As forms inner-sphere binuclear \n\nsurface complexes with aluminium (Arai and Sparks, 2002; Goldberg and Johnson, 2001; \n\nLadeira et al., 2001; Foster et al., 1998) and iron (hydr)oxides (Makris et al., 2007; \n\nSherman and Randall, 2003; Fendorf et al., 1997; Grossl et al., 1997; Sun and Doner, 1996; \n\nManceau et al., 1995). These stable complexes can account for the generally low desorption \n\nof arsenic by carbonate and phosphate. Notwithstanding, our data suggest that these \n\ncomplexes are to a certain extent more stable for poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 and Fh \n\nfollowed by Hm in relation to goethite and gibbsite. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATION \n\nOur investigation presented insights related to arsenic mobilisation from Al-\n\nsubstituted goethites and other synthetic Al and Fe (hydr)oxides under anoxic conditions \n\ninfluenced by microbiological activity as well as by competing anions. Differences in Fe \n\nand As dissolution as affected by the nature of the (hydr)oxides were observed. In the \n\n\n\n 68\n\nabsence of competing ion, arsenic mobilisation from Gb and poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 \n\nwas negligible, since aluminium does not participate as electron acceptor for bacterial cells. \n\nIn contrast, S. putrefaciens cells were able to reduce iron from both noncrystalline and \n\ncrystalline iron (hydr)oxides. For Al-substituted goethites we observed a decrease in the \n\nfraction of soluble iron and arsenic mobilisation as structural Al increased. Structural Al \n\naffected the expected relationship between specific surface area and iron dissolution \n\npreventing arsenic mobilisation. In relation to arsenic desorption by phosphate and \n\ncarbonate in the presence of S. putrefaciens cells, iron dissolution and arsenic mobilisation \n\nvaried according to the competing anion. Both phosphate and carbonate were able to desorb \n\ngreat amounts of arsenic from Gb, but the fraction of As displaced by phosphate from Al-\n\nsubstituted goethites increased as structural Al increased. Then, we infer that the binding \n\nmechanism on the surface of these crystalline matrixes is governed to a certain extent by a \n\nweak binding complex. Poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 was the most efficient in holding \n\narsenate firmly on its surface followed by Fh and Hm. The poorly crystalline Al and Fe \n\nhydroxides proved to be most efficient phases in retaining arsenic, but aluminium \n\nhydroxide gains an advantage over Fh under reducing conditions. Arsenic released from \n\npoorly crystalline Al(OH)3 was less than 8 % by carbonate\n in both presence and absence of \n\niron reducing bacteria, and nearly 15 % by phosphate. Concerning to arsenic release under \n\nreducing condition, Fh showed to be more stable than poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 only in a \n\nlater incubation time after 240 hours in the presence of phosphate as competing anion. \n\nOnce soluble iron increased to a certain level, it combined with phosphate or carbonate \n\ngiving rise to new metastable vivianite and siderite phases, as predicted by thermodynamics \n\ncalculations. Apparently, vivianite can act as a sink for soluble arsenic limiting its \n\nmobilisation, but the same can not be assumed for siderite. Therefore, poorly crystalline \n\nAl(OH)3 can be considered the most effective adsorptive system to immobilise arsenic, \n\nbecause the presence of soluble carbonate is more common than phosphate in \n\nenvironmental conditions. \n\nAluminium and iron (hydr)oxides are ubiquitous in the environment, and goethite is \n\none of the thermodynamically most stable iron oxides (Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003). \n\nThus, the presence of goethite with high structural Al may contribute to not only to \n\nimprove the As(V) adsorption capacity of soils and sediments, but also to diminish its \n\n\n\n 69\n\nmobilisation under reducing conditions. In contrast, intense use of phosphate fertiliser and \n\nliming or carbonate produced via microbial metabolism may add further complication to \n\npotential arsenic desorption from soils and sediments with high content of Gb, a common \n\nmineral in many soils.  \n\nIn water treatment, adsorptive process has been preferred due to its facility to handle \n\nthe As-rich residues generated after adsorption process. Most investigations have suggested \n\nthe use of hydrous ferric oxides to remove arsenic from drinking water due to their large \n\nsurface area and consequently high efficiency. However, the disposal of the As-rich \n\nresidues under reducing conditions, as might occur at a waste disposal sites (Masue et al., \n\n2007), is a very concerning issue with regards to the redox transformations of Fe(III) to \n\nFe(II) mediated by dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria leading to arsenic mobilisation. \n\nHence, as Al is not redox sensitive, the use of a poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 can be \n\nconsidered a good option for removing arsenic from contaminated water, since under our \n\nexperimental conditions it showed to be the most efficient in retain arsenic. The use of Al-\n\nsubstituted goethites should also be taking into account as they presented high stability and \n\nAs retention under anoxic conditions. Only in the presence of phosphate Al-substituted \n\ngoethites were less effective than other iron (hydr)oxides, but environmental conditions \n\npresenting large P:As ratio as used herein is quite improbable. \n\nNevertheless, prediction of arsenic mobility is a very complex issue, and As sorption \n\nmodelling requires a more detailed comprehension of the bonding mechanism and kinetics. \n\nThus, investigations are warranted to further elucidate the binding mechanisms that play a \n\nkey role on arsenic sorption on Al-substituted goethites surfaces. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 70\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5.

Poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 and \n\nferrihydrite, presented higher arsenate adsorption efficiency, followed by Al-substitued \n\ngoethites. The stability of the As-rich residue under reducing conditions was also higher to \n\npoorly crystalline Al(OH)3 e Al-substituted goethites. In the presence of competing anions, \n\nphosphate and carbonate, the adsorbed arsenate on poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 was stable, \n\nhowever, the same was not verified to Al-substituted goethites in the presence of \n\nphosphate. These results suggest the alternative use of Al to increase efficiency of water \n\ntreatment methods. Use of poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 would represent advantage in relation \n\nto disposal of sludge from water treatment plants under reducing conditions as well as in \n\nphosphate-rich eutrophic environments and in the presence of dissolved carbonates. In this \n\nsense, Al-substituted goethites are also promising alternatives, except when the As-rich \n\nresidue needs to be disposed in unusually phosphate enriched environments. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 76\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nREFERENCE \n\n \n\nAnawar, H.M., Akai, J., Komaki, K., Terao, H., Yoshioka, T., Ishizuka, T., Safiullah, S., \nand Kato, K., 2003.
