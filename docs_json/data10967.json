The samples were uniaxially pressed \nat 287 MPa and subsequently vacuum heat treated in two stages, the first one at 200 \u00b0C for 5 hours to decompose \nthe carbonate and the second one at 1150 \u00b0C for 2 hours to sinter the steel. The sintered samples had a close \nporous structure and a multimodal pore size distribution that varied with the foaming agent and its concentration. \nThe samples obtained by addition of 30 wt. (%) of foaming agents had a more homogeneous porous structure \nthan that obtained with 15 wt. (%). The MTT cytotoxicity test (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium \nbromide) was used to evaluate the mitochondrial activity of L929 cells with samples for periods of 24, 48, and \n72 hours. The cytotoxicity test showed that the steel foams were not toxic to fibroblast culture. The sample with \nthe best cellular growth, therefore the most suitable for biomedical applications among those studied in this \nwork, was produced with 30 wt. (%) ammonium carbonate. In this sample, cell development was observed after \n48 hours of incubation, and there was adhesion and spreading on the material after 72 hours. Electrochemical \nexperiments using a chloride-containing medium were performed on steel foams and compared to massive steel. \nThe massive steel had a better corrosion performance than the foams as the porosity contributes to increase the \nsurface area exposed to the corrosive medium. \n\nKeywords: stainless steel, cellular solids, powder metallurgy, cytotoxicity\n\n1. Introduction\n\nAustenitic stainless steels are frequently used in biomedical \napplications, such as orthopedic implants, due to properties like high \ncorrosion and fatigue resistance as well as high fracture toughness. \nIn addition to biocompatibility, these properties are important in the \nselection and adaptation of a material for biomedical applications. \nHowever, the major problem concerning orthopedic metallic implants \nis the mismatch of Young\u2019s modulus between bone and bulk metallic \nmaterial. Due to this mechanical mismatch, bone is insufficiently \nloaded and becomes stress shielded, which eventually leads to bone \nreabsorption. If the bone loss is excessive, it can compromise the \nlong-term performance of the prosthesis1-3.\n\nMetal foams with extremely low density and good combination \nof properties have excellent potential for implant application because \nof the reduced stiffness mismatches4. Additionally, bone ingrowth is \npossible, which could greatly improve the bone-implant interface \nand may allow for efficient soft tissue attachment supplementing \nthe stability of the implant by biological fixation5,6. The greatest \napplication fields are in the osseous reconstructive surgery, such as \ntreatment of small bone defects, cranio-maxillofacial reconstruction, \ntooth root replacements and vertebral body replacement6.\n\nOpen-cell and closed-cell are the major classification of porous \nmetals, or metal foams. In closed-cell foams, each cell is completely \nenclosed by a thin wall or membrane of metal, whilst in open-cell \nfoams the individual cells are interconnected, allowing tissue to \ninfiltrate the foam and anchor it into position. Although open-cell \nmetals are preferred for use in implants because they facilitate \n\nbone ingrowth, metals with a closed-cell structure may be used in \northopedic load bearing implants1. \n\nThe selection of materials for medical applications is also based \non considerations of in vivo performance. The orthopedic prostheses \nare commonly used for extended time and are subject to a highly \naggressive medium that constitutes the human body, fluids rich in \nsodium chloride. Therefore, when metals and alloys are considered, \nthe susceptibility of the material to corrosion and its local and \nsystemic effects should be considered. The corrosion product can \ncause changes in the histology of local tissue either by toxic effects \nas by local hypersensitive. This biological response may cause loss \nof part of implant and surgical revisions1. Corrosion resistance of the \ncurrently used 316L stainless steel relies on their passivation by a thin \nsurface layer of oxide. However, studies1,7 have demonstrated that \nporous 316L exhibited poor corrosion resistance due to potentially \nhigher corrosion rates that can occur in vivo with the irregular and \nporous surface geometry. Seah et al.8 showed that corrosion resistance \ndecreased with decreasing porosity, which was attributed to the small, \nisolated pore morphology that traps ionic species and restricts the \naccess of oxygen, which in turn limits the available oxygen for the \nformation of the corrosion resistant passive layers. In highly porous \ncompacts with an open, interconnected pore morphology, the free flow \nof species resulted in a material with increased corrosion resistance.\n\nDifferent processes have been used in the fabrication of porous \nmetals1,9. Casting or vapor deposition techniques tend to allow \ngreater control over pore size, distribution, and interconnectivity, \n\nMaterials Research. 2011; 14(2): 146-154 \u00a9 2011\n\nDOI: 10.1590/S1516-14392011005000021\n\n\n\nPorous Stainless Steel for Biomedical Applications\n\nwhich produce open-cell geometries. Other processes involving \ndecomposition of foaming agents in either molten or powder metal \nmatrices10,11 give lower porosity and less predictable pore distribution \nand interconnectivity. In the \u2018Fraunhofer\u2019 process12, which has been \nsuccessfully used to make closed-cell aluminum foams, the metal \npowder is blended with a granular foaming agent and compacted by \nconventional means, yielding a fully dense semi finished product. \nThe compact is expanded to foam by heating it to the melting \npoint, T\n\nm\n, whereupon gas is evolved from the decomposition of the \n\nfoaming agent. In this method, the foaming agent must undergo \nthermal decomposition near T\n\nm\n and generate gas pressure in the \n\nmetal matrix sufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and cause \nfoaming. Foam expansion results in closed-cell foam with a relative \ndensity of 0.2-0.8, depending on the particular process parameters \nemployed12,13. The syntheses of steel foams by this route are difficult \nbecause of the high melting point and the low melt viscosity of steel. \nA similar process was used to produce a porous structure in TiZr2 \nand Ti-Sn-Nb alloys14. Particles of ammonium hydrogen carbonate \nwere used as the space-holding material. This carbonate decomposes \nat low temperature, then the metal foams were obtained in the solid \nstate during a two-stage heat treatment to burnout the space-holding \nparticles (~200 \u00b0C) and to sinter the steel (1200-1300 \u00b0C).\n\nThe aim of this work was to investigate the feasibility of \nsynthesizing porous 316L stainless steel samples by powder \nmetallurgy route using ammonium carbonate and ammonium \nbicarbonate as foaming agents and a two-stage heat treatment to \nsinter the steel. The effect of foaming agent and its concentration on \nthe development of the pore structure and corrosion properties were \nevaluated. The MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium \nbromide) colorimetric assay was used to measure cytotoxicity and \ncell proliferation and to assess the suitability of the material for \nbiomedical applications.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\nThe composition of commercial 316L stainless steel powder \nspecified by the AMS 5507D is presented in Table 1, while Table 2 \npresents the granulometric analysis of steel powder certified by the \nsupplier. The steel powder was mixed with the foaming agents: \nammonium carbonate and ammonium bicarbonate, in a planetary \nball mill at 60 rpm for 10 minutes with a ball to powder weight ratio \nof 28:1. Mixtures were produced with 15 and 30 wt. (%) ammonium \ncarbonate and bicarbonate with the aim of producing porous samples \nwith relative density of 0.5 and 0.3, respectively. The samples were \nuniaxially pressed at 287 MPa and then vacuum heat treated (10\u20132 bar) \nin two stages, the first one at 200 \u00b0C for 5 hours to decompose the \ncarbonate and the second one at 1150 \u00b0C for 2 hours to sinter the steel. \nTwenty samples were produced for each condition with 10 mm in \ndiameter for the citotoxicity assays. The samples for electrochemical \nexperiments were 20 cm in diameter. Samples of pure 316L stainless \nsteel (no porous material) were also produced and sintered at 1150 \u00b0C \nfor 2 hours in high vacuum (10\u20136 bar) in order to minimize the \noxidation and compare the effect of the pores in the cytotoxicity test. \n\nThe apparent density and relative density was determined for all \nsamples (twenty for each condition) in the green and sintered states. \nThe apparent density was measured using the mass and dimensions \nof samples (?\n\ng\n) and the relative density (?\n\nr\n) was calculated as the \n\nratio of the apparent density and theoretical density calculated for \neach mixture. Helium pycnometry was used to determine the true \ndensity (?\n\nt\n) of the samples. The open porosity (P\n\no\n) was estimated \n\nfrom the relation between the true density and the geometrical \ndensity, according to the expression: P\n\no\n = (1 \u2013 (?\n\ng\n /?\n\nt\n)). The pore size \n\ndistribution was analyzed by mercury porosimetry over a pressure \n\nrange of 0 to 50 psi. The samples were submitted to a heat treatment \nat 120 \u00b0C for 2 hours to clean and eliminate moisture before the pore \nsize distribution analyses. Morphological characterization was carried \nout by optical and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM).\n\nThe cytotoxicity assay was evaluated according to ISO 10993-5 \n\u201cBiological evaluation of medical devices - Test for cytotoxicity: \nin vitro methods\u201d (or EN 30993-5), using direct contact. The \nproliferate activity of cultured cells was determined with the \nMTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) \ncolorimetric assay, as described by Mosmann15. Latex fragments \nwere used as the positive control and fragments of proven non-toxic \npaper filter were used as the negative control. The dimensions of \nthese fragments were the same of the samples. All the samples were \nsterilized for 24 hours under UV irradiation and placed in individual \nwells of 24-well culture plates. L929 cells were inoculated in each \nwell at a concentration of 5 \u00d7 105 cells.mL\u20131, supplemented with 10% \nfetal bovine serum (Gibco, BRL). The incubation was performed \nunder a CO\n\n2\n (5%) atmosphere at 37 \u00b0C for different times. The \n\nviability of cells was determined after 24, 48 and 72 hours. After the \nincubation time, the samples and the positive and negative control \nfragments were removed from the respective wells. Only the cells \nthat adhered to the well walls were incubated with a tetrazolium salt \nsolution (MTT), (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium \nbromide) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 4 hours at 37 \u00b0C. The MTT \nwas reduced to an insoluble formazan precipitate by mitochondrial \nsuccinic dehydrogenase of the viable cells. After removal of the \nmedium, ethanol-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma) solution \n(1:1) was added to each well. After complete solubilization of the \ndark blue crystal of MTT formazan, the absorbance of the content of \nwells was measured at 570 nm with a 24-well microplate reader on a \nspectrophotometer Spectra Count (Packard). The blank reference was \ntaken from wells without cells, which were also incubated with the \nMTT solution. The cell viability was calculated by the normalization \nof optical densities (OD) using the following expression:\n\n (1)\n\nThe cellular adhesion capacity of the L929 cells on the samples \nwas tested at incubation periods of 48 and 72 hours. After the culture, \nthe cells attached on the samples were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde \nin 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 hour and dehydrated in a \ngraded ethanol solution series (30, 50, 70, 95, 100%) for 10 minutes \neach. The drying stage used a solution of ethanol (50%) with \n\nTable 1. Chemical Composition in weight percent of stainless steel 316L \n(AMS 5507D).\n\nComposition Cr Ni Mn Si S C P Mo Fe\n\nwt.

SEM characterization was done on dried samples. \n\nElectrochemical study was carried out on massive steel and \nsteel foams produced with 15 wt. (%) ammonium carbonate and \nbicarbonate with a Potentiostat/Galvanostat model MQPG-01 \nMicroquimica. The electrochemical experiments were performed \nat 25 \u00b0C in a one-compartment cell containing three electrodes. The \nworking electrodes were the 316L steel foams and the massive one \ninlaid on Teflon\u00ae, with a 0.79 cm2 disc shaped exposed area. The \nreference electrode was a saturated Ag / AgCl, Cl\u2013 electrode and the \nauxiliary electrode was a platinum rod.\n\nThe electrochemical experiments were investigated by \npotentiodynamic polarization curves in a 0.1 mol.L\u20131 NaCl solution \n(pH = 5.9), which was not stirred, open to the atmosphere at 25 \u00b0C. \nThe experiments were carried out by varying the potential of electrode \nat 10 mV/s, from \u2013700 up to +500 mV and \u2013500 up to +1500 mV, \nreversing the potential down to \u2013700 mV. The electrochemical \nparameters were obtained from the Tafel plots.\n\n3. Results and Discussion\n\nApparent density (?\ng\n) and relative density (?\n\nr\n) at green and \n\nsintered states, as well as the picnometry density of 316L steel foams \nand the calculated open porosity are show in Table 3. The average \ndensities of green samples are very close to the theoretical values \nof the mixtures, so almost full density samples were obtained. The \nsamples synthesized with ammonium carbonate presented relative \ndensities slightly higher than that produced with the ammonium \nbicarbonate. However, no significant differences are observed if \nthe deviations of the average density values are taken into account. \nAfter sintering, steel foams with relative densities of 0.3 and 0.5 were \nsuccessfully obtained using both foaming agents. Helium picnometry \ndensities are lower than that of theoretical density of 316L stainless \nsteel (8 g.cm\u20133), showing that about 10 to 20% of the pores in the \nsteel foams are closed. The steel foam produced with 15 wt. (%) \nammonium carbonate presented the higher fraction of closed pores.\n\nFigure 1 and 2 present, respectively, a comparative set of \noptical and SEM micrographs of steel foams synthesized with \n15 and 30 wt. (%) ammonium carbonate and bicarbonate. The pore \ndistribution obtained is very heterogeneous and composed by irregular \nand isolated pores. Large and/or coalesced pores on the edge surface \nof samples can be observed in Figure 1e, while smaller and isolated \npores can be seen in the middle of the samples, Figures 1a-d. This \nfact occurs probably due to more facility of flow of gas on the surface \nof the samples. Steel foams produced with 30 wt. (%) foaming \n\nagents show larger pores, which are more homogeneous in size and \ndistribution (Figures 1c, 1d, 2c and 2d) than those produced with \n15 wt. (%) foaming agents, where larger pores are surrounded by \nsmall ones (Figures 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b).\n\nFigure 3 shows the pore size distribution obtained by mercury \nporosimetry. The lowest mercury volume intruded was obtained for \nthe massive steel, according with the largest relative density obtained \namong the sintered samples. Among the steel foams, those produced \nwith 15 wt. (%) foaming agents had the largest mercury volumes \nintruded, indicating, apparently, higher volume fraction of pores in \nsamples with higher relative densities. This result could be explained \nby the minimum pore size that can be analyzed by the Hg porosimeter \nused in this work, which is 1000 \u00b5m. As showed by optical and SEM \nmicrographs, steel foams obtained with 30 wt. (%) foaming agents \npresent larger pores than those of the steel foams produced with \n15 wt. (%). The external regions of the samples are formed by the \ncoalescence of pores as show in Figure 1e. These regions and the \nlarger pores in the steel foams produced with 30 wt. (%) foaming \nagents might have been full filled with Hg before pressure was applied, \nwhich resulted in a lower intruded volume during analysis. Figure 3 \nshows also that samples produced with 15 wt. (%) of foaming agents \nhave a large fraction of pores with size smaller than 6 \u00b5m, which is \nconsistent with the micrographs of Figure 1 where a large amount \nof small pores can be seen around larger ones. \n\nThe distribution of open pores less than 1000 \u00b5m illustrated in \nFigure 3 shows that steel foam obtained with 15 wt. (%) ammonium \ncarbonate has a trimodal pore size distribution with a close distribution \nof pores with mean diameter at 5 \u00b5m and other two wide distribution \nat 20 and 300 \u00b5m. The foam obtained with 15 wt. (%) ammonium \nbicarbonate shows a very similar distribution. Steel foam produced \nwith 30 wt. (%) ammonium carbonate also presented a trimodal pores \nsize distribution, one very close with mean diameter at 10 \u00b5m and \nother two at 50 and 450 \u00b5m. The sample produced with 30 wt. (%) \nbicarbonate presented only a broad distribution with a mean diameter \nof 70 \u00b5m.\n\nAlthough optimum pore size required for implant fixation remains \nundefined, the consensus is that in order to optimize mineralized bone \ningrowth, pore sizes between 100 and 400 \u00b5m are necessary1,16-19. \nHowever, effective bone ingrowths into porous coatings with pore \nsizes down to 50 \u00b5m have been related1. Conversely, when the pore \nsize is increased beyond 1 mm there seems to be an increasing \ntendency for the formation of fibrous tissue. Based on porous sizes \ndistribution the samples produced with 15 wt. (%) foaming agents \nand 30 wt. (%) ammonium carbonate seem to be appropriate for \napplications as biomaterials.

(%)). Considering the \nsamples produced with ammonium bicarbonate, that with 15 wt. (%) \nshowed low cell viability after 72 hours, the lowest among all the \nporous samples, while the 30 wt.

These cells \nhave a flat morphology and present some filaments. Figure 6c shows \nthe spreading of some cells after 72 hours on sample produced \nwith 15 wt. (%) ammonium bicarbonate, while Figure 7c show \nonly isolated cells (arrows) on samples produced with 30 wt. (%) \nammonium bicarbonate. This late condition proved to be the worst \nfor cellular development, which may be related to the pore size \ndistribution, a monomodal distribution with a mean diameter of \n70 \u00b5m.\n\nThe use of ammonium carbonate in the production of porous \nsamples seems to promote the adhesion and proliferation of cells. \nFigure 6b show SEM micrographs where cells showing a flat \nmorphology and cytoplasmic webbing (micrograph of higher \nmagnification attached to Figure 6b) are well distributed on the \nsample produced with 15 wt. (%) ammonium carbonate. After \n72 hours, a large amount of cells is observed, Figure 6d, with a \nspherical morphology and cytoplasmic prolongations connecting the \ncells. The adhesion and proliferation of cells had also occurred on \nsamples produced with 30 wt. (%) of ammonium carbonate. In this \ncase, already after 48 hours the cells show a spherical morphology, \nFigure 7b. The presence of cells with spherical morphology on these \nsamples shows that there was cellular division and the sequence \nof cellular development agrees with the model proposed by \nRajaraman et al.20. The model proposes that the major events in the \nprocess of adhesion and spreading seem to be attachment of the cell \nto the substratum, radial growth of filopodia, cytoplasmic webbing \nand the resultant flattening of the cell. During mitosis a reversal of \nthese events occurs by cytoplasmic de-webbing, the cell becomes \nspherical while anchored to the substratum by long filopodia and \n\nafter mitosis, the two daughter cells become flat again by cytoplasmic \nwebbing. It should be emphasized that these different stages are not \ndiscretely separable but are different phases of a contiguous process. \nThe duration of these phases and the degree of overlapping of these \nevents may vary between different cell lines and different substrates20. \n\nIn this work, the cell growth was more apparent in samples \nwith 15 and 30 wt. (%) ammonium carbonate, which presented two \nwide pore size distributions at 20 and 300 \u00b5m, and 50 and 450 \u00b5m, \nrespectively. This result is in accordance with optimum pore size \nrequired for implant fixation, between 100 and 400 \u00b5m, described in \nliterature1,16-19. These samples presented cells covering the material \nand cellular division. It is important to emphasize that the cells were \ninitially in suspension and after 24 hours were already interacting \nwith the material. The cells that were not on the surface of the \nsample had normal proliferation, which was verified in the graphs \nof cytotoxicity. The interaction of the cells with the material surface \nis considered very important to the effectiveness of medical implants \nand can determine the degree of rejection. The chemistry of materials \nsurface can determine the cellular response to the material and affect \nthe cellular adhesion, proliferation, migration, and function21-24.\n\nThe results of cytotoxicity and SEM showed that the foaming \nagent and pore size influenced the interactions between cells and \nsubstrate. The fibroblasts in contact with the samples, had adhesion, \nproliferation, migration, and cellular viability for the culture intervals \nstudied, but less than in the controls.

(%) ammonium carbonate (C)) in contact with 0.1 mol.L\u20131 \nNaCl aqueous solution, pH 5.9 are shown in Figure 8. The values of \npotential observed for the sets of measurements are in agreement with \nthe literature25. The values vary between 0.18 and 0.27 V. Table 4 shows \nthe electrochemical parameters from the potentiodynamic polarization \ncurves. Comparing the electrochemical parameters, the anodic current \ndensity (j\n\ncorr\n) is lower when the surface is the massive steel (A). The \n\nsteel foams produced with 15 wt. (%) ammonium bicarbonate (B) and \n15 wt. (%) ammonium carbonate (C) presented similar values of \nanodic current densities, but these values are four times higher than the \nmassive steel value (A). The massive steel presented better corrosion \nperformance in a chloride-containing medium.\n\nFigure 9 shows the results of an anodic polarization test for the \n316L massive steel (A), 316L steel foam with 15 wt. (%) ammonium \nbicarbonate (B) and 316L steel foam with 15 wt. (%) ammonium \ncarbonate (C). The samples was maintained for 24 hours at an open \ncircuit potential, and then polarized anodically at a scanning rate of \n10 mV/s. An Ag/AgCl, Cl\u2013 was used as a reference electrode, platinum \nrod as a counter electrode and 0.79 cm2 disc shaped exposed area \nas working electrode. The three types of steels showed a current \ndensity of between \u20130.50 and 0.25 mA.cm\u20132. Comparing the results of \nFigure 8 and 9 one can observe differences which can be attributed to \na passivation effect of the steel surface26. The change in the corrosion \npotential value can be justified by the attack of the species, which \ncross the pores of the steel foams, forms a layer of passivated material \nstopping the progress of the corrosion.\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nSteel foams with relative densities of 0.3 and 0.5 were \nsuccessfully obtained by powder metallurgy using the two foaming \nagents: ammonium carbonate and ammonium bicarbonate. \n\nVery heterogeneous pore structures, composed by irregular and \nisolated pores, were obtained. Large and/or coalesced pores were \nobserved on the surface; while smaller and isolated pores could \nbe seen in the middle of the samples. Steel foams produced with \n30 wt. (%) foaming agents showed larger pores, more homogeneous \nin size and distribution than that with 15 wt. (%) samples. \n\nThe steel foams were not toxic to fibroblasts culture. The \nsamples that presented better cell viability were produced with \n30 wt. (%) foaming agents. Adhesion and cell growth was higher in \nthe 30 wt. (%) ammonium carbonate. Cell development was observed \nafter 48 hours of incubation and after 72 hours, there was adhesion \nand spreading on the material. This sample presented the best pore \nsize distribution to improve cell growth, a trimodal distribution, with \nmean diameters of 10, 50, and 450 \u00b5m.\n\nMassive steel had better corrosion performance in a chloride- \ncontaining medium than the steel foams, because porosity contributed \nto increased display area in the corrosive medium.\n\nAlthough new experiments, such as mechanical and in vivo tests, \nare necessary, the results show that the steels foams produced in this \nwork can be viable in orthopedic implants.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors acknowledge the METALP\u00d3 by 316L stainless \nsteel powder and the LCP/INPE by helium picnometry and mercury \nporosimetry analysis. \n\nReferences\n1.
