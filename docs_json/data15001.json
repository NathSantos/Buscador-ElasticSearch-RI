DM type 1 therapy is based on the subcutaneous administration of \n\ninsulin in accordance to glucose levels, which is associated with patient\u00b4s poor \n\ncompliance. Following this, the aim of this project is to produce an insulin delivery \n\nsystem sensitive to hyperglycaemia, avoiding the need of glycaemia monitoring while \n\npromoting a better glucose homeostasis control. \n\nIn this work, a glucose sensitive insulin delivery system started to be developed \n\nbased on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles containing insulin and \n\ncatalase and decorated with glucose oxidase (GOx). The principle for insulin release is \n\nbased on the conversion of glucose into H2O2 whenever glycaemia levels are high; \n\nafterwards the breakdown of H2O2 into H2O and O2 by catalase leads to an increased \n\npressure inside the nanoparticles, causing them to break and to release insulin. \n\nAn initial catalase encapsulation study was conducted. Immobilized catalase was \n\nnot only active but it also showed increased stability in comparison with free catalase. A \n\nrelease profile could be observed in response to the presence of H2O2. Furthermore, \n\nGOx immobilization on PLGA surface was also accomplished and a significant enzymatic \n\nactivity and stability were achieved. Afterwards, insulin and catalase were co-\n\nencapsulated within PLGA nanoparticles and the insulin release pattern was evaluated. \n\nHowever, and in contrast with initial results observed for encapsulated catalase, insulin \n\nrelease was not triggered by the presence of H2O2. The optimized immobilization \n\nconditions for catalase are not suitable for insulin delivery probably due to the PLGA \n\nsurface porosity and insulin smaller size in comparison with catalase. \n\nFuture work may include the encapsulation of insulin linked to polyethylene \n\nglycol (PEG), in order to obtain a larger molecule and by this way avoiding its release \n\nthrough PLGA pores and improving the release of insulin. \n\n  \n\n \n\nKeywords: Diabetes mellitus; nanoparticles; PLGA; insulin; glucose sensitive delivery system \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n Preparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n \n\n \n\nix \n \n\nResumo \n \n\nA Diabetes mellitus (DM) \u00e9 uma doen\u00e7a que atinge cerca de 415 milh\u00f5es de \n\npessoas, caracterizada por um aumento da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de glucose sangu\u00ednea. A \n\nterapia da DM tipo 1 \u00e9 baseada na administra\u00e7\u00e3o subcut\u00e2nea de insulina de acordo com \n\nos n\u00edveis de glic\u00e9mia, o que contribui para a diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da qualidade de vida do doente. \n\nAssim, o objectivo deste projecto \u00e9 produzir um sistema de veicula\u00e7\u00e3o de insulina \n\nsens\u00edvel a condi\u00e7\u00f5es de hiperglic\u00e9mia, reduzindo a necessidade de monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\nn\u00edveis de glic\u00e9mia e melhorando o controlo da homeostase da glucose. \n\nNeste trabalho, iniciou-se o desenvolvimento de um sistema de veicula\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ninsulina sens\u00edvel \u00e0 hiperglic\u00e9mia, usando nanoparticulas de \u00e1cido poli l\u00e1ctico/glic\u00f3lico \n\n(PLGA) com vista a co-encapsular catalase e insulina e com derivatiza\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 superf\u00edcie \n\ncom glucose oxidase (GOx). O principio da liberta\u00e7\u00e3o da insulina baseia-se na convers\u00e3o \n\nda glucose em H2O2 quando a glic\u00e9mia est\u00e1 elevada e por sua vez o H2O2 \u00e9 cindido em \n\nH2O e O2 pela catalase, provocando o aumento da press\u00e3o dentro das nanopart\u00edculas e \n\nconsequentemente, a sua ruptura e a liberta\u00e7\u00e3o da insulina.  \n\nInicialmente, a encapsula\u00e7\u00e3o da catalase foi estudada e demonstrou-se n\u00e3o s\u00f3 \n\nque tinha actividade, mas que tamb\u00e9m que apresentava maior estabilidade do que a \n\ncatalase livre. O seu perfil de liberta\u00e7\u00e3o foi avaliado em resposta \u00e0 presen\u00e7a de H2O2. A \n\nimobiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de GOx \u00e0 superf\u00edcie das nanopart\u00edculas de PLGA foi conseguida com \n\nactividade enzim\u00e1tica e estabilidade significativa. Posteriormente, foi realizada a co-\n\nencapsula\u00e7\u00e3o de insulina e catalase nas nanoparticulas de PLGA e o perfil de liberta\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda insulina foi avaliado. No entanto, a liberta\u00e7\u00e3o da insulina n\u00e3o foi influenciada pela \n\npresen\u00e7a de H2O2. Estes resultados demonstram que as condi\u00e7\u00f5es \u00f3ptimas de \n\nencapsula\u00e7\u00e3o da catalase n\u00e3o s\u00e3o as mesmas para a insulina, uma vez que a superf\u00edcie \n\ndo PLGA \u00e9 porosa e a insulina tem um tamanho mais pequeno que a catalase.  \n\nNo trabalho futuro poder-se-\u00e1 estudar a encapsula\u00e7\u00e3o de insulina ligada a \n\npolietilenoglicol (PEG), de modo a obter uma molecula maior e a evitar a sua liberta\u00e7\u00e3o \n\natrav\u00e9s dos poros na superf\u00edcie do PLGA, melhorando o perfil de liberta\u00e7\u00e3o da insulina.  \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Diabetes mellitus;nanopart\u00edculas;PLGA;insulina;sistema de veicula\u00e7\u00e3o sens\u00edvel \u00e0 glucose.\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n Preparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n \n\n \n\nxi \n \n\nAbbreviations \n \n\nBSA Bovine serum albumin \n \n\nDCM Dichloromethane \n \n\nDM Diabetes Mellitus \n \n\nDMSO Dimethyl sulfoxide \n \n\nEDC N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N?-ethylcarbodiimide \nhydrochloride \n\nEE Encapsulation Efficiency \n \n\nEMA European Medicines Agency \n \n\nFDA Food and Drug Administration \n \n\nGOx Glucose oxidase \n \n\nHCl Hydrochloric acid \n \n\nH2O2 Hydrogen peroxide \n \n\nHPLC High pressure liquid chromatography \n \n\nKM Michaelis-Menten constant \n \n\nMw Molecular weight \n \n\nNHS N-Hydroxysuccinimide \n \n\nPLGA Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) \n \n\nPVA Poly(vinyl alcohol)  \n \n\nPEG Polyethylene glycol \n \n\n  \nSEM Scanning electron microscope \n\n \nt1/2 Half-life \n\n \nTFA Trifluoroacetic acid \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nxii \n \n\nVmax Maximum velocity \n \n\nW/O/W Water/oil/water \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n Preparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n1 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.Introduction \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1. Diabetes \n \n\n1.1.Diabetes physiopathology  \n\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) is among the major global health problems, affecting \n\napproximately 415 million patients worldwide (Federation, 2015). According to recent \n\nstudies, 60 million people suffer from DM in Europe and the disease has a prevalence \n\nof 13% in Portugal, corresponding to approximately 1 million people (Diabetologia, \n\n2014;WHO, 2015). The distribution of DM around the world is heterogeneous and its \n\nincreased incidence has a high impact in society. Following this, much attention has \n\nbeen given to new approaches in DM diagnosis and therapy (King et al., 1998;Mo et al., \n\n2014;Veiseh et al., 2015). \n\nDM is a metabolic disease diagnosed by glucose blood levels higher than 6 \n\nmmol/L (108 mg/dL) during the fasting period and/or glucose blood levels higher than \n\n7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) 2 hours after food ingestion (WHO, 2006;Veiseh et al., 2015). \n\nDM is characterized by several symptoms, including: frequent infections, increased urine \n\nvolume, thirst and unexplained weight loss. Drowsiness and coma can occur in severe \n\ncases. Comorbidities with high impact to patient\u2019s mortality, such as coronary artery \n\ndisease, diabetic retinopathy, member amputation and renal insufficiency, may arise \n\ndue to vascular complications caused by the difficulty to maintain normoglycaemia (Gu \n\net al., 2013).  \n\nDM can be divided into type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes. In DM type 1, an \n\ninefficient insulin production leads to a deregulated glycaemia homeostasis, whereas in \n\nDM type 2, cells of the Human body lack to respond to endogenous insulin (Mo et al., \n\n\n\n1.Introduction \n\n2 \n \n\n2014;Veiseh et al., 2015). DM type 1 is an autoimmune disease affecting pancreas, \n\ncharacterized by ??cells destruction mediated by immune system T?cells (McCall et al., \n\n2013). Also known as juvenile diabetes, DM type 1 accounts for 10% of diabetic \n\npatients and its therapy is based on insulin replacement coupled with a tight glucose \n\nmonitoring (Dabelea, 2009). In contrast, in DM type 2 a gain of insulin resistance \n\noccurs, mainly associated with obesity and a poor life style and the initial non-insulin \n\ntherapy has the main objective of delaying the disease progression (Veiseh et al., \n\n2015). The most common cause of new cases of blindness is due to diabetic \n\nretinopathy, a microvascular disease that affects almost all patients with DM type 1 \n\nand more than 60% of patients with DM type 2 (Fong et al., 2004;Bjornstad et al., \n\n2015). The third type of DM, called gestational diabetes is characterized by \n\nhyperglycaemia occurring during pregnancy. This condition may persist in a very low \n\nfrequency after pregnancy and in some cases insulin is used for treatment (Guemes et \n\nal., 2015). \n\n \n\n1.2.Insulin\u00b4s physiological action  \n\nIn physiological conditions, pancreatic ??cells in Langerhans islets produce \n\ninsulin, a protein hormone responsible for the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid \n\nmetabolism, having the main function of contributing to the homeostasis of glucose. \n\nThis regulation is a vital function since glucose is a primary energy source for the brain \n\ncells (Stryer et al., 2008). Structurally, human insulin comprises 51 amino acids and has \n\na molecular weight of 5808 Da. Insulin is synthesized as preproinsulin by ??cells, \n\nundergoing several processes before becoming mature insulin which comprises two \n\npolypeptide chains (A and B) with three disulfide bonds, two of them connecting the \n\npolypeptide chains (figure 1.1). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPreparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn response to high levels of blood glucose, insulin is released by pancreatic cells, \n\ncirculates through the blood stream and binds to insulin receptors located in insulin \n\nsensitive cells, promoting an increased presence of glucose transporters at the cell \n\nsurface (Stryer et al., 2008). Insulin receptors, mainly located in skeletal muscle, adipose \n\ntissue and brain cells (figure 1.2), when activated, promote glucose transport from blood \n\ninto cells through major glucose transporter (type 4, GLUT4) recruitment and \n\ntranslocation from intracellular vesicles to the cell surface \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.2 Schematic representation of insulin action \n\nA\n\nA\n\nB\n\nB\n\nFigure 1.1(A) Crystal structure (PBD ID: 3I40; (Timofeev et al., 2010)) and (B) amino acid \nsequence of Human insulin (adapted from (PharmaWiki, 2015)) \n\n\n\n1.Introduction \n\n4 \n \n\nInsulin receptor is a dimer and each sub-unit is formed by one ? and one ? chain, \n\nlinked by a single disulfide bond. The ? subunit of this receptor is inside the cell and has \n\none transmembrane segment, whereas the ? subunit has an extracellular location. The ? \n\nsubunit consists in a protein tyrosine kinase that catalyses phosphoryl group \n\ntransference from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to a tyrosine. A cross-phosphorylation \n\nperformed by the two ? subunits on each other leads to the activation of the receptor \n\nand initializes a signalling cascade inside the cell with several players, including protein \n\nkinase B (Akt), mainly associated with metabolic processes (Saltiel et al., 2001;Stryer et \n\nal., 2008). In response to low insulin levels, insulin is dissociated from its receptor \n\ninterrupting the signalling cascade, promoting GLUT4 recycling back into the cytosol and \n\nstopping glucose entrance into the cell (Stryer et al., 2008;Mo et al., 2014).  \n\nInsulin pathway is involved in glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism in the \n\nliver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, represented in figure 1.2. While promoting \n\nglucose transport into cells, insulin is also contributing to glucose storage in the target \n\ntissues, but its action is much more vast, including: appetite decrease; stimulation of \n\nglycogen synthesis in muscle and liver; reduction of glucose release, hepatic \n\nglycogenolysis (glycogen breakdown) and gluconeogenesis (glucose synthesis pathways); \n\nenhancement of lipogenesis in the liver (fatty acid synthesis) and lipolysis (lipid \n\nbreakdown) inhibition in adipose tissue (Stryer et al., 2008;Matteucci et al., 2015). All \n\nthese mechanisms demonstrate the importance of insulin in the regulation of \n\ncarbohydrate and lipid metabolism. In addition, insulin also decreases autophagy, renal \n\nsodium excretion and proteolysis (Puigserver et al., 2003;Quan et al., 2013;Bunner et al., \n\n2014;Mo et al., 2014).  \n\nInsulin action contributes to keep glucose blood levels between 4 and 6 mmol/L \n\n(72 to 108 mg/dL) (WHO, 2006;Veiseh et al., 2015) and its production follows a pattern \n\nunder physiological conditions. A continuous basal secretion occurs during fasting \n\nperiods and an increased insulin production is induced after food ingestion. At meal \n\ntime, insulin concentration increases leading to a peak after 45-60 minutes and returns \n\nto basal levels within 2/3 hours after meal. An important aspect of insulin production \n\nduring the night and other prolonged fasting periods is its dependence with other \n\nfactors such as circadian rhythms that contribute to regulate glucose production (Pettus \n\net al., 2015).  \n\n\n\nPreparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n1.3.Insulinotherapy  \n\nAccording to the type and the stage of DM, glycaemia levels may need to be regulated \n\nthrough insulin therapy. Clinical application of insulin was an important milestone in the \n\ntherapy of DM (figure 1.3), since until then DM therapy was only based in food \n\nrestriction and associated with a poor prognosis (Sanger et al., 1953;Johnson, \n\n1983;Mayer et al., 2007). Even after insulin isolation, immunogenicity associated with \n\ninsulin of animal origin and low purity were negative aspects that caused poor \n\nreproducibility of the therapeutic response and patient compliance. Currently, \n\nrecombinant technology is able to synthesize Human insulin and analogues with \n\nimproved stability and prolonged action. The administration of external insulin aims to \n\nmimic insulin levels, pattern of secretion and distribution, promoting the achievement of \n\nphysiologic glucose blood concentrations. Nevertheless, despite several important \n\naccomplishments in DM therapy including the isolation of bovine insulin and the \n\nproduction of Human insulin, the amount of administrated insulin still needs to be \n\nregulated according to patient glucose levels monitoring, through multiple daily \n\ninjections. Furthermore, insulin administration is mostly subcutaneous and is associated \n\nwith pain, hypoglycemia episodes and weight gain (Kennedy, 1991;Han\u00e5s et al., \n\n1997;Fonte et al., 2015). Type 1 DM patients make use of a combination of two types of \n\ninsulin in a multiple daily injection scheme including long-acting and rapid-acting insulin \n\naccording to the food ingestion periods, requiring approximately 4 injections per day \n\n(Tibaldi, 2014;Pettus et al., 2015). Several long-acting insulin formulations, shown on \n\ntable 1-1, are commercial available and provide a slow insulin action, mimicking basal \n\ninsulin levels in fasting periods. In contrast, rapid-acting insulin formulations are able to \n\nincrease insulin levels in a short period of time, which is ideal to control blood glucose \n\nafter meal time. Besides the need of multiple insulin administrations, a major concern in \n\nthe therapy of DM is nocturnal hypoglycemia, a dangerous situation that can occur due \n\nto small basal insulin increase. Moreover, evening physical exercise appears to be a risk \n\nfactor for nocturnal hypoglycemia (Briscoe et al., 2006;Campbell et al., 2015;Wilson et \n\nal., 2015).  \n\n\n\n Preparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\nFigure 1.3 Schematic representation of the principal milestones of insulin therapy \n\n\n\n Preparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\nThe advances in recombinant DNA technology allowed new insulin structure \n\nmodifications, such as: substitution, addition or depletion of specific amino acids. These \n\nmodifications helped to optimize insulin pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic \n\nprofiles, including insulin absorption delay, which lead to the commercialization of \n\nnewer long-acting insulin formulations, such as Glargine and Determin (table 1-1). A \n\nconsequence of these formulations with a larger period of action was to provide a more \n\nflexible administration, increasing patient compliance. However, overnight blood \n\nglucose control is still a problem in many situations; as well as weight gain (Heinemann \n\net al., 2000;Kurtzhals, 2007;Pettus et al., 2015). More recently, ultra-long-acting insulin \n\n(i.e. degludec, table 1-1) with increased action duration and less pharmacodynamics \n\nvariations and hypoglycemic events represent an interesting alternative enabling only \n\none injection per day. Furthermore, conjugation of insulin with polyethylene glycol (PEG) \n\n(i.e. peglispro) also provides a longer duration of rapid-action insulin, lispro (table 1-1). \n\nDespite these recent developments concerning insulin formulation, drawbacks of \n\nconventional injectable insulin stimulate research regarding new administration routes \n\nand insulin delivery systems. In order to improve patient compliance and mimic \n\nphysiologic insulin response, oral and pulmonary administration routes are seen as \n\npromising approaches. \n\nTaking into account patient compliance, oral administration is the most \n\nattractive. In addition, the possibility of having an intestinal absorbance through oral \n\nroute would allow insulin to reach the liver through portal circulation, which is the first \n\ntarget of pancreatic insulin secretion and where a tight glycaemia control occurs. This \n\nroute is closer to what happens in physiological conditions in contrast with \n\nsubcutaneous administration, where only approximately 20% of insulin reaches liver \n\n(Brown et al., 1979;Gordon Still, 2002;Sonaje et al., 2010). Unfortunately, insulin \n\nbioavailability is drastically reduced by oral administration due to stomach acidic pH as \n\nwell as due to enzymatic and physical barriers. The acidic pH of stomach and enzymatic \n\nactivity contributes to insulin degradation whereas the gastrointestinal epithelium is \n\nimpermeable to insulin (Chen et al., 2011;Chaturvedi et al., 2013). Following this, several \n\nstrategies have been designed in order to protect insulin native structure, such as: the \n\nco-delivery with enzyme inhibitors, the use of absorption enhancers and also insulin \n\ndelivery systems (Morishita et al., 1993;Sindhu et al., 2011). \n\n\n\n Preparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\nTable 1-1 Available insulin formulation \n\nAdministration \n\nActive \n\nmolecule \n\nname \n\nType Structural Modification Consequence Advantage \nTime of \n\naction \n\nYear \n\n(FDA/EMA) \n\nRef \n\n \n\nS\nu\n\nb\ncu\n\nta\nn\n\ne\no\n\nu\ns \n\nLispro Rapid \n\nLysine (B29) and proline (B28) on \n\nthe C-terminal end of ? chain are \n\nreversed \n\nFormation of insulin dimers and \n\nhexamers is blocked \n\nInsulin monomers are \n\nimmediately available \n4 hours 1996/1996 \n\n(Atkin et al., \n\n2015) \n\nAspart Rapid \nProline (B28) replaced by aspartic \n\nacid \nInhibited aggregation into hexamers \n\nRapid entrance in \n\nbloodstream \n5 hours 2000/2000 \n\n(Hermansen et \n\nal., 2015) \n\nGlargine Long \n\nSubstitution of asparagine for \n\nglycine (A21); Addition of two \n\nargine (B21 and B32) \n\nInsulin isoelectric point changes \n\nfrom pH 5.4 to pH 6.7 \u2013 \n\nmicrocrystals formation after \n\ninjection \n\nSlow insulin release 4 hours 2000/2000 \n(Pettus et al., \n\n2015) \n\nGlulisine Rapid \n\nAsparagine (B3) replaced by \n\nlysine; lysine (B29) replaced by \n\nglutamic acid \n\nInsulin hexamers formation inhibited \nRapid entrance in \n\nbloodstream \n5 hours 2004/2004 \n\n(Heise et al., \n\n2007) \n\nDetermin Long \n\nC14 fatty acid covalent bond to \n\nlysine (B29); terminal threonine \n\n(B30) removal \n\nInsulin increased self-association \n\ninto hexamers and di-hexamers; \n\nreversible binding to albumin \n\nSlow absorption into \n\nbloodstream \n\n24 \n\nhours \n2005/2004 \n\n(Atkin et al., \n\n2015) \n\nDegludec \nUltra-\n\nlong \n\nDeletion of threonine (B30); C16 \n\nfatty acid linked through a \n\nglutamic acid spacer \n\nInsulin soluble multihexameric chain \n\nSlowly monomers \n\ndissociation into \n\nbloodstream \n\nUp to 40 \n\nhours \n\n20\n\n15/2013 \n\n(Atkin et al., \n\n2015) \n\nPulmonary Afrezza Rapid \n\nInsulin encapsulation within \n\nmicrospheres of fumaryl \n\ndiketopiperazine (FDKP) \n\nMicroparticles dissolve in neutral pH \n\nof lungs \n\nRapid absorption of \n\ninsulin \n\n2-3 \n\nhours \n2014/  --- \n\n(Sarala et al., \n\n2012) \n\n\n\n Preparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\nBesides oral administration, pulmonary administration is also an interesting \n\napproach due to: the large surface area for absorption in the lungs; tiny alveolar \n\nmembrane; and high vascularization, which are important properties to allow efficient \n\ninsulin permeation.

In addition, insulin delivery through buccal, nasal and transdermal \n\nare also seen as alternative routes with potential to overcome currently diabetic therapy \n\nproblems (Fonte et al., 2015).Following this, a more comfortable administration route \n\nbesides the tight blood glucose control without requiring glycaemia monitoring remain \n\nas two unfulfilled needs in DM therapy in order to promote a better quality of life to DM \n\npatients. \n\n \n\n2. Nanoparticles delivery systems \n\n \n\n2.1.Nanoparticles delivery systems \u2013 general aspects \n\nDeveloped research concerning insulin action and DM disease contributed to a \n\ncomprehensive understanding of therapeutic opportunities and challenges. An ideal \n\ninsulin delivery system should be able to respond autonomously to glucose levels, \n\ncontributing to promote normoglycaemia and to improve patient\u2019s lifestyle and \n\ncompliance. Furthermore, insulin delivery systems based on nanoparticles are \n\ninteresting approaches due to the need of insulin protection against pH and enzymatic \n\ndegradation and due to the possibility of being capable to cross specific barriers such as \n\nskin and intestinal barrier, increasing insulin bioavailability and promoting a controlled \n\nrelease through structural modifications on nanoparticles surface (Ma, 2014;Pandita et \n\nal., 2015). Examples of insulin encapsulation using different types of delivery systems \n\n\n\n1.Introduction \n\n10 \n \n\nare presented in table 1-2 and all referred studies had the purpose to reduce glycaemia \n\nlevels reduction using in vitro and in vivo conditions. \n\nNanoparticle delivery systems represent an important approach in the \n\ntherapeutic field of many diseases such as DM, cancer, and inflammatory diseases \n\n(Pandita et al., 2015). Not only with the purpose to obtain more efficient drug delivery \n\nsystems, nanoparticles have also been explored for the diagnosis of several diseases \n\n(Kapoor et al., 2015;Pandita et al., 2015;Sadat et al., 2015). Nanoparticles are solid \n\nstructures, typically with 100 nm and with physical, chemical and biological properties \n\ntuneable according to their constituents and production method (Sharma et al., 2015;Yu \n\net al., 2015). A large range of molecules can be incorporated within nanoparticles from \n\nsmall drugs to macromolecules, including vaccines. Drug delivery systems may not only \n\npromote drug delivery to a specific target, but may also allow an improved metabolic \n\nstability, time of action and a low systemic toxicity (Kanzarkar et al., 2015;Kovalainen et \n\nal., 2015). Particles surface engineered with antibodies, proteins and other molecules \n\nmay be used to increase selectivity for specific organs and tumours, influencing \n\nbiodistribution and promoting enhanced half-life time in blood (Danhier et al., \n\n2012;Pandita et al., 2015). Moreover, although many materials are already approved by \n\nFood and Drug Agency (FDA) and European Medicine Agency (EMA) for drug delivery \n\nsystems in Humans, some toxicity issues such as immunogenicity may be associated with \n\nnanoparticles showing the importance of in vitro and in vivo toxicity testing. \n\nNanoparticles properties including size, shape and surface charge may be fine tuned in \n\norder to circumvent toxicity issues (Makadia et al., 2011;Shah et al., 2014). Furthermore, \n\nthe scaling-up of these systems and the high cost of nanoparticles are two other \n\ndrawbacks of nanotechnology (Danhier et al., 2012).  \n\n \n\n\n\n Preparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\nTable 1-2 Examples of insulin delivery systems \n\nISTPPLG: insulin-loaded tocopherol poly(ethylene glycol) 1000 succinate-emulsified poly(ethylene glycol)-capped poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles; SP: soybean phosphatidylcholine \n\n \nParticles Properties  \n\nTherapeutic Outcome \n\nRef \n \n\nObservations \nMaterial Method EE (%) Size \n\nAdministration \nroute \n\nBurst \nRelease \n\nIn\nsu\n\nli\nn\n\n \n\nPLGA \n(85:15) \n\nDouble \nemulsion \n\n50 350 nm Skin 15-25% \nInsulin-protamine complex \n\nSustained release of insulin over one week \nImproved insulin stability in PLGA particles \n\n(Wang et al., 2008) \n\nSoybean \nlecithin \n\nHomogenizatio\nn \n\n89 100 nm Skin --- \nEnhanced insulin transdermal delivery through microneedle-\n\ninduced microchannels \n(Chen et al., 2009) \n\nPLGA \n(50:50) and \ncyclodextrin \n\nDouble \nemulsion \n\n59 26.2 \u00b5m Nasal \u00b1 30% \nLarge porous biodegradable particles \n\nDry powder  formulation for controlled release of insulin \n(Ungaro et al., 2009) \n\nPLGA \n(50:50) \n\nDouble \nemulsion \n\n57.8 1-6 \u00b5m Nasal 25% \nPharmacokinetic studies show a sustained insulin release profile \n\n(90% release in 48 hours) \nMinimal toxicity signs (inflammation) \n\n(Hamishehkar et al., \n2010) \n\nChitosan \nPolyelectrolyte \ncomplexation \n\n55 \u00b1 235 nm Oral &lt;10% \nProtection of insulin and high delivery through intestinal barrier \n\npH sensitive insulin delivery \n(Makhlof et al., 2011) \n\nISTPPLG \nDouble \n\nemulsion \n8.6 180 nm Oral \u00b1 20% \n\nInsulin release with glucose levels control; reduction of \ncholesterol, urea, creatinine levels \n\n(Malathi et al., 2015) \n\nPLGA \n(50:50) \n\nDouble \nemulsion \n\n9.2 279 nm Oral \u00b1 10% \nPLGA nanoparticles with Concanavalin A on its surface to increase \n\nlymphatic uptake \nSustained insulin release \n\n(Hurkat et al., 2012) \n\nCarbon \nspheres \n\nwith \nchitosan \n\n 3.4 330 nm Oral &lt;10% \nNanospheres coated with a biocompatible polymer; Improved \n\nintestinal absorption and insulin release \n(Ganeshkumar et al., \n\n2013) \n\nPLGA \n(50:50) \n\nDouble \nemulsion \n\n60 &lt;200 nm Oral 20% \nNanoparticles surface coating with peptides to improve intestinal \n\nabsorption \n \n\n(Zhu et al., 2015) \n\nPLGA, PEG \nand SP \n\nDouble \nemulsion \n\n2.3 212 \u00b5m Oral --- Sustained insulin release for 24h; low toxicity (Yu et al., 2015) \n\n\n\n Preparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\nAn essential aspect for a successful nanoparticle formulation is to have a high \n\ndrug loading (i.e. percentage of loaded amount of drug relative to the total amount of \n\nnanoparticles) and encapsulation efficiency (EE) (i.e. percentage of loaded amount of \n\ndrug relative to the total amount of drug used for the formulation), with the aim of \n\nreducing the amount of solids that are administrated and the production costs (Danhier \n\net al., 2012), but poor drug loading is a frequent occurring negative condition that need \n\nbe optimized. The most popular method for drug encapsulation is the incorporation of \n\nthe drug during nanoparticles production; but drug adhesion after particle production \n\nmay also be applied. An important parameter during drug encapsulation is the stability \n\nof the encapsulated molecules during the process in order to avoid aggregation and \n\nactivity loss in the case of the encapsulation of enzymes, for instance. Among other \n\ncharacteristics, particle size is a very important one, since it influences cell uptake, \n\nrecognition by the immune system and drug release profile (Owens et al., 2006;Mittal et \n\nal., 2007). In general, nanoparticles vary in size between 10 and 1000 nm but ideally, \n\nparticles should be smaller than 200 nm to have a prolonged bloodstream circulation \n\n(Singh et al., 2009;Sharma et al., 2015). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2.Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based nanoparticles \n\n \n\n2.2.1.General aspects \n\nPoly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer \n\nwidely used in several kinds of nanoparticles systems, such as: vaccines, protein delivery, \n\nanti-inflammatory, antibiotic and in anticancer therapy formulations (Horisawa et al., \n\n2002;Jiang et al., 2005;Choi et al., 2006;Luo et al., 2009;Toti et al., 2011). This polymer is \n\navailable in several molecular weights and copolymer composition, which influences its \n\ndegradation time, particle size and drug encapsulation (Danhier et al., \n\n2012;Mohammadi-Samani et al., 2015). \n\nComposed by lactic and glycolic acid, PLGA is associated with a minimal systemic \n\ntoxicity, due to the fact that these monomers, produced by PLGA hydrolysis, can be \n\n\n\nPreparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n13 \n \n\nfound endogenously and may be incorporated in the Krebs cycle (Muthu, 2009). FDA \n\nand EMA approval for PLGA bioapplication in humans contributed to its popularity and \n\nextensive study. Its capability to promote drug sustainable release allows a reduced \n\nfrequency of administration, dose and to achieve stable drug levels in blood, leading to \n\nan increased therapeutic effect and reduced side effects. This sustainable release is \n\nmainly caused by polymer degradation through two different mechanisms: bulk erosion, \n\nconsisting on a homogeneous and predominant degradation of PLGA; and surface \n\nerosion that arises in a heterogeneous manner. A low polymer molecular weight \n\nincreases solubility in organic solvent causing a solidification rate decrease which leads \n\nto more porous and smaller particles (Mu et al., 2003;Mittal et al., 2007;Makadia et al., \n\n2011). Smaller particles have higher surface area which is good for drug diffusion. Also, \n\nlow polymer concentration and lactic ratio promotes particles with more porous \n\nstructure and an increased hydrophilic nature, respectively (Mu et al., 2003;Yeo et al., \n\n2004;Doan et al., 2013). A negative aspect of PLGA degradation is the pH reduction of \n\nthe microenvironment which may influence drug stability and release (Sung et al., \n\n2004;Ding et al., 2008). The degradation and interaction of PLGA products with drug \n\nmolecules contributes to drug decomposition and incomplete drug release (Zolnik et al., \n\n2007;Makadia et al., 2011). Moreover, burst release, which occurs through fissures and \n\npores of the particles, represents one of PLGA pitfalls (Yeo et al., 2004;Hinds et al., \n\n2005). Despite the fact that the fast release of drug in a burst stage is used in specific \n\ndrug administration strategies, the negative effects brought by burst effect can be \n\npharmacologically dangerous and economically inefficient. Molecules adsorbed to the \n\nnanoparticles surface are also responsible for burst release. Several conditions may be \n\nfine tuned in order to reduce this effect including the polymer hydrophobicity, polymer \n\nconcentration and amount of drug loaded. High burst effect is associated with \n\ncopolymer PLGA composition since a high glycolic acid content increases water uptake \n\nfrom the medium and a fast particles hydration (O'Hagan et al., 1994). High amounts of \n\ndrug loaded are also related to increased values of this effect, probably because of the \n\nhigh active principle concentration gradient between the nanoparticles and the medium. \n\nAssociated to adsorbed proteins on particles surface is the creation of water channels on \n\nnanoparticles structure that promote high burst releases associated to high protein \n\nloadings (O'Hagan et al., 1994;Yang et al., 2001). Moreover, reduced polymer \n\n\n\n1.Introduction \n\n14 \n \n\nconcentration promotes internal porosity and high burst effect (Yang et al., 2001;Yeo et \n\nal., 2004). \n\n \n\n2.2.2.Formulation Methods \n\nMany techniques can be used to produce PLGA-based nanoparticles. According \n\nto drug properties, several nanoparticles production methods may be used in order to \n\nachieve the desired drug loading and release. In the emulsification solvent diffusion \n\nmethod, PLGA and drug are dissolved in a partially water-miscible solvent such as benzyl \n\nalcohol, which is then dispersed in a great amount of water. This quantity of water is \n\nsufficient to cause diffusion of the solvent into the external phase, deposition of the \n\npolymer around the droplets and nanoparticles formation (Kwon et al., \n\n2001;Guinebretiere et al., 2002). Moreover, in the emulsification-salting out method, \n\nused to encapsulate lipophilic molecules, the PLGA dissolved in acetone is emulsified in \n\nan aqueous solution with a high salt concentration (Reis et al., 2006;Felice et al., 2014). \n\nIn addition, nanoprecipitation consists in the diffusion of a solution containing the drug \n\nand PLGA into a non-solvent (where both drug and polymer are not dissolved). Polymer \n\ndiffusion into the non-solvent solution produces a rapid polymer precipitation and drug \n\nencapsulation. This method is primarily used for the encapsulation of hydrophobic drugs \n\n(Bilati et al., 2005;Felice et al., 2014). \n\nThe most commonly used method for encapsulation within PLGA particles is the \n\nemulsification-solvent evaporation technique, mainly applied for hydrophobic drugs \n\nencapsulation. Relatively simple and without needing expensive instruments, in this \n\nmethod several parameters need to be tuned such as the kind of organic solvent used, \n\ntemperature and rate of homogenization (Blanco et al., 1998;Katare et al., 2006;Wang, \n\n2010). Single or double-emulsion-solvent evaporation techniques are based on the \n\nformation of one or two emulsions using high-speed homogenization or sonication, \n\nfollowed by organic solvent evaporation. \n\nIn the single-emulsion technique, the emulsion is produced after dissolving both \n\ndrug and polymer in an organic solvent, the oil (O) phase, which is then emulsified in \n\nwater (oil in water, O/W). The water phase contains water and a surfactant, such as \n\npoly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (Menon et al., 2012;Sadat et al., 2015). The presence of the \n\n\n\nPreparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\nsurfactant contributes to the emulsion stability and prevents particles aggregation, by \n\nchanging the zeta potential. During sonication or homogenization, nanosized droplets \n\nare generated and the organic solvent is then allowed to evaporate. \n\nIn order to encapsulate hydrophilic drugs such as: proteins, peptides or nucleic \n\nacids, a variation of this oil in water (O/W) technique is needed. Hydrophilic drugs \n\nrequire a double emulsion W/O/W technique in order to have a first shield of water \n\nwhere the drug is dissolved. The W/O/W procedure is produced by a primary water in oil \n\n(the aqueous solution is dispersed in the organic solution) and a second oil in water \n\nemulsion (Danhier et al., 2012;Menon et al., 2012;Sadat et al., 2015). The stability of \n\nthese emulsions influences drug encapsulation, with particular emphasis to the first \n\nemulsion, highly associated with the loss of drug activity (van de Weert et al., 2000). In \n\nmany cases, after solvent evaporation, nanoparticles are collected by centrifugation and \n\ndried, using procedures such as lyophilisation. Lyophilisation allows long term stability of \n\nnanoparticles storage at low temperatures; although in some cases nanoparticles are \n\npreferentially stored in an aqueous solution without undergoing any drying process \n\n(Abdelwahed et al., 2006;Kasper et al., 2011).  \n\nThe common step in all techniques is the production of a first emulsion, whereas \n\nthe second step varies according to the procedure. More stable emulsions produce \n\nsmaller particles, depending on the kind of surfactant used and its concentration (Sahoo \n\net al., 2002;Budhian et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2.3.Protein encapsulation  \n\nCurrently, the administration of proteins is mainly based on repeated injections \n\nthrough invasive routes, such as subcutaneous and intravenous (Shaji et al., 2008). Many \n\nefforts have been done to improve protein delivery using nanoscale vehicles, with the \n\nattempt to protect proteins from enzymatic and hydrolytic degradation, enhance \n\nbioavailability and protein concentration at the target tissue (Sharma et al., 2015;Yu et \n\nal., 2015). \n\nPLGA nanoparticles formulation steps, above highlighted, are critical for protein \n\nstability. Focusing on W/O/W method, the presence of water/organic solvent interfaces \n\n\n\n1.Introduction \n\n16 \n \n\nis a huge drawback since it is identified as the major cause of protein unfolding, followed \n\nby denaturation and aggregation (Qi et al., 2011;Kovalainen et al., 2015). The shear \n\nstress created by homogenization and sonication also promotes protein aggregation. In \n\nparticular, sonication seems to be more aggressive to protein stability due to local \n\ntemperature extremes and free radical formation. Hydrophobic contacts between \n\nprotein and polymer are also responsible for unfolding and aggregation (Kang et al., \n\n2001;Wu et al., 2011). All procedure steps are critical and may induce protein \n\ndenaturation and aggregation, but the first emulsion is more detrimental and in many \n\ncases additives should be added to the first emulsion in order to reduce water/organic \n\nsolvent interfaces and to promote protein stabilization. Addition of bovine serum \n\nalbumin (BSA), gelatin, surfactants and sugars are some examples of excipients used in \n\nthis technique (Morlock et al., 1997;P\u00e9rez-Rodriguez et al., 2003;Singhal et al., 2013). \n\nThese additives are able to decrease protein interaction with W/O interface and interact \n\nspecifically with protein surface, promoting the protection of hydrophobic regions, \n\nwhich reduces protein denaturation and aggregation (Ye et al., 2010;Fonte et al., \n\n2012;Ma, 2014). Furthermore, besides bioactivity loss, denatured or aggregated \n\nproteins may induce toxicity and immunogenicity (Perez et al., 2001;Castellanos et al., \n\n2002;Ye et al., 2010).  \n\nIn the second emulsion, interfacial stress is also responsible for protein unfolding. \n\nMoreover, during the generation of the second emulsion, water channels between \n\ninternal and external aqueous phases may lead to protein escape from inner droplets, \n\nincreasing interface area and protein denaturation. In the drying step, the removal of \n\nsolvent may also cause denaturation and aggregation of proteins. Following this, many \n\nprocesses need to be optimized during polymeric nanoparticles formulation to avoid \n\ndenaturation or aggregation of native proteins, which influences its release and \n\ntherapeutic efficacy (van de Weert et al., 2000;Ye et al., 2010). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPreparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\n3. Enzyme kinetics \n\n \n\n3.1.General aspects \n\nEnzymes are biologic catalysts, capable of increasing the rate of chemical \n\nreactions by reducing its activation energy. Cellular environment is often unfavourable \n\nto non-catalysed reactions and many reactions would occur in an unsuitable rate \n\nwithout catalysis. Therefore, enzymes provide favourable environments for these \n\nreactions, being indispensable to life (Lehninger et al., 2008;Stryer et al., 2008). \n\nMoreover, enzymes are not destroyed during the reaction process, are high specific and \n\ndo not interfere in the chemical equilibrium (Lehninger et al., 2008;Stryer et al., 2008). \n\nNearly all enzymes are proteins, generally with a globular structure and one or more \n\nsubstrates binding sites. Enzymes activity is determined by its tridimensional structure \n\nand influenced by several conditions including: pH, temperature, substrate \n\nconcentration and ionic strength (Scopes, 2002). A small part of the tridimensional \n\nstructure is the active site, where substrates bind. This area is responsible for enzymatic \n\nspecificity defined by its charges and shape properties, allowing the binding of a single \n\nkind of substrate. In accordance to this complementarity, the \u201clock and key hypothesis\u201d \n\nwas proposed by Fisher in 1894, proposing that only a specific substrate (key) was able \n\nto bind to a particular active site (lock). Currently, another hypothesis was raised, which \n\nis based on a slight enzyme shape modification that allows substrate binding (known as \n\nthe \u201cglove-in-hand\u201d model) (Stryer et al., 2008;Robinson, 2015). Enzymatic activity can \n\nalso be dependent on the presence of cofactors, a non-protein component with organic \n\n(coenzymes) or metal nature. An enzyme without its cofactor is named apoenzyme, \n\nwhereas the complete catalytic structure is the holoenzyme. Additionally, cofactors \n\ntightly bound to enzymes are known as prosthetic groups (Stryer et al., 2008). \n\nEnzyme kinetics is the study of reaction rates catalysed by enzymes, which is an \n\nimportant tool to characterize enzyme function. During an enzymatic reaction, an \n\nincrease of product amount though time is observed until the reaction reaches an \n\nequilibrium state. In 1913, Michaelis and Menten proposed the model described by \n\nequation 1, where E is the enzyme, S is the substrate, P is the product and ES is the \n\nenzyme-substrate complex. The limiting step of these reactions is the breakdown of the \n\n\n\n1.Introduction \n\n18 \n \n\nES complex, which is dependent on the kcat (catalytic constant) and that leads to product \n\nformation, whereas the first reaction is fast and reversible and in this case dependent on \n\nthe rate constants: k1 and k-1(Michaelis et al., 1913;Lehninger et al., 2008).  \n\nIn equation 2, vmax is the maximum initial reaction rate and KM is the Michaelis-\n\nMenten constant. KM is associated with the affinity of the enzyme for a substrate at a \n\nspecific temperature and pH. Small KM is related to high substrate affinity, promoting a \n\nfast achievement of vmax. The relation between the reaction rate (vO) and the substrate \n\nconcentration [S] is represented in figure 1.4, where vmax is approached asymptotically \n\nwhenever the substrate concentration is high and KM is the substrate concentration \n\nwhen the reaction rate is half of vmax. Moreover, whenever the substrate concentration \n\nis much smaller than KM, the reaction can be reduced to a first order equation where the \n\nreaction rate is directly proportional to the substrate concentration. However, when the \n\nsubstrate concentration is much higher than KM, v0=vmax, a zero order equation can be \n\nused independently of the substrate concentration(Michaelis et al., 1913;Stryer et al., \n\n2008).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(1) (2) \n\nFigure 1.4 Michaelis-Menten kinetics.

The \n\nenzyme activity is influenced by several conditions such as: temperature, pH, solvents \n\nand immobilization. A comprehensive study of these parameters allows extrapolation to \n\nin vivo activity. However, in vitro studies do not mimic the complexity of in vivo \n\nenvironment (Scopes, 2002;Robinson, 2015).  \n\nThe activity assay can be studied based on substrate consumption or product \n\nformation and can be performed following the progression of the reaction continuously \n\nor stopping the reaction at fixed times. In the first case the activity can be followed \n\ndirectly by measuring specific parameters, such as: absorbance, pH or fluorescence for \n\ninstance allowing product or substrate quantification. This analysis has the advantage of \n\nbeing direct, avoiding operating errors related with the stopping procedure. Moreover, a \n\ncontinuous coupled assay can also be performed, where the product of a first reaction is \n\nused by a second enzyme, leading to a detectable change, generally absorbance. The \n\nconstant rate can be determined in this case if no product inhibition and reversal of \n\nreaction occurs (Henderson et al., 1992;Purich, 2002;Scopes, 2002). In the non-\n\ncontinuous assay, an extreme condition such as acidic or alkali pH, extreme \n\ntemperatures or irreversible inhibitors are used to interrupt the reaction and proceed to \n\nsubstrate/product quantification (Purich, 2002;Scopes, 2002). \n\n \n\n3.3.Catalase \n\nCatalase was named in 1900 by Loew, after its identification as responsible for \n\nH2O2 breakdown, however, only 86 years later, Human catalase gene was isolated and \n\ncharacterized(Loew, 1900). Despite the difference in the Catalase amino acid sequence \n\nbetween different species, some specific amino acids related to enzyme function are \n\nconserved and allow the general definition of mammalian catalase (Zamocky et al., \n\n1999). Structurally, mammalian catalase is a homotetramer with a molecular mass (Mw) \n\nof 225\u2013270 kDa and each subunit comprises a heme group at the active site only \n\nreachable by small substrates (figure 1.5). In comparison to many other enzymes, \n\n\n\n1.Introduction \n\n20 \n \n\ncatalase is more resistant to pH and thermal changes due to its rigid and stable structure \n\n(Kirkman et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPhysiologically, catalase is an antioxidant enzyme involved in cell protection \n\nagainst reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during aerobic respiration, with a \n\npredominant function of controlling hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration. In order to \n\nprevent oxidative stress and its destructive effects, catalase and other enzymes such as \n\nsuperoxide dismutase and peroxiredoxin have a protective role in aerobic cells, although \n\ntheir activity are also found in anaerobic environments (Rocha et al., 1996). Catalase is a \n\nvery efficient enzyme, capable to decompose about 107 million molecules of H2O2 per \n\nsecond and its activity is predominant in liver, erythrocytes, kidney and adipose tissue \n\n(Goyal et al., 2010). Moreover, the catalase capability to break H2O2 into molecular \n\noxygen and water (equation 3), without free radicals production is an important aspect \n\nto avoid cellular death. Despite its relevance in physiological conditions, catalase \n\ndeficiency is mainly a risk factor besides the enzyme deficiency. Catalase deficiency or \n\nacatalasemia, which refers to an inherited near-total deficiency of its activity, is \n\nassociated to inflammation, inhibition of apoptosis and cancer (Kirkman et al., \n\n2007;Goth et al., 2013). Furthermore, catalase appears to be related to DM \n\ndevelopment as a result of ? cells damage by H2O2 (Kirkman et al., 2007;Afanas' ev, \n\n2010). \n\n \n\n                         2 H2O2 ?2 H2O+O2                                               (3) \n\nFigure 1.5 Crystal structure of human catalase PDB ID: 1DGF, \n(Putnam et al., 2000) \n\n\n\nPreparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n21 \n \n\n \n\nDue to its physiologic activity, catalase can be used as a therapeutic enzyme in \n\norder to reduce high ROS levels in several pathologic conditions such as radiation, \n\nischemia and tumour progression (Singhal et al., 2013;Huang et al., 2015). The purpose \n\nof using catalase as a therapeutic agent is challenging. In contrast with some low \n\nmolecular weight antioxidants, such as vitamin C and ascorbate, catalase has a large size \n\nand its distribution is restricted to certain tissues and organs. This limitation can \n\nhowever be an advantage in some diseases, such as cancer. Unique tumour vasculature \n\nis fenestrated and large size molecules can easily cross, providing a controlled release of \n\nthis enzyme (Ma et al., 2006;Nishikawa et al., 2009). In addition, the in vivo delivery of \n\ncatalase is associated with a fast degradation and limited passage through membranes \n\n(Nishikawa et al., 2005;Nishikawa et al., 2009). An interesting approach to overcome \n\ndelivery problems is to encapsulate or immobilize catalase on the surface of \n\nnanoparticles delivery systems (Giovagnoli et al., 2005;Li et al., 2012;Wu et al., \n\n2013;Vilian et al., 2014). Nevertheless, poor encapsulation efficiency and activity \n\nretention remain as relevant problems that still need to be solved. \n\n \n\n3.4.Glucose Oxidase \n\nIn 1928, Muller discovered Glucose-1-Oxidase (GOx) in Aspergillus niger extracts, \n\nallowing its DNA sequencing and protein structure determination in the next few \n\ndecades (Kriechbaum et al., 1989;Wohlfahrt et al., 1999). In nature, GOx is produced by \n\nsome fungi and insects. GOx is a glycoprotein, homodimer, composed by two identical \n\nsubunits, each one with 80 kDa, and two flavin adenine dinucleotides (FAD) non-\n\ncovalently bound, illustrated on figure 1.6 (Pazur et al., 1965;Wong et al., 2008). The \n\nFAD coenzyme acts as an electron carrier (Wilson et al., 1992). Also, GOx reaction \n\nrequires an electron acceptor, commonly dissolved oxygen, while the sugar molecule is \n\nthe electron donor (Bohmhammel et al., 1993;Wong et al., 2008). GOx catalyses the \n\noxidation of beta-D-glucose to D-gluconolactone and H2O2 (equation 4) and both of this \n\nproducts spontaneously break down into gluconic acid and water and oxygen, \n\nrespectively (Wilson et al., 1992;Wong et al., 2008). \n\n \n\n\n\n1.Introduction \n\n22 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n       Glucose+ O2 ?D-gluconolactone+ H2O2                  (4) \n\n \n\nAn interesting GOx property is its high specificity for glucose. In comparison to \n\nthe reaction rate of glucose (100%), only 2-deoxy-D-glucose, 4-O-methyl-D-glucose and \n\n6-deoxy-D-glucose suffer oxidation by GOx, but with reaction rates lower than 20% \n\n(Pazur et al., 1964;Wong et al., 2008). In addition to its specificity, GOx is an enzyme \n\nwith high stability and high turnover. Therefore, many industrial and commercial \n\napplications use GOx, such as food and healthcare industry. In the alimentary field, it is \n\ncommonly used as preservative and to reduce alcohol wine content, while in the \n\nhealthcare sector it is widely used in biosensors (Wong et al., 2008). Biosensors \n\nevolution through the last decades was impulsed by DM diagnosis and monitoring. In \n\nfact, glucose biosensors used by DM patients are based in the use of GOx. In 1962, the \n\nconcept of measuring glucose levels through a biosensor was proposed. Glycaemia was \n\nfirstly measured based on GOx reaction by quantifying oxygen consumption that was \n\nproportional to glucose concentration. But in order to increase enhance glucose \n\nmonitoring precision, further GOx reaction was explored and in 1974 the first glucose \n\nbiosensor was commercially available and was based on H2O2 detection. Currently, \n\nglucose monitoring is based on electron transference between GOx and specific \n\nelectrodes (Kirsch et al., 2013;Taguchi et al., 2014). \n\n \n\nFigure 1.6 Crystal structure of glucose oxidase from Aspergillus Niger, PBD \nID:1GAL (Hecht et al., 1993) \n\n\n\nPreparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n23 \n \n\n3.5.Glucose-sensitive systems \n\nGlucose-sensitive systems are extensively studied with the purpose of insulin \n\ndelivery, taking advantage of a specific response to high glucose levels. Currently, insulin \n\nrelease triggered by glucose follows one or both of the two mechanisms: material \n\nalteration in response to a change of an environmental condition or through a reaction \n\nexchange of preloaded insulin with glucose (Wu et al., 2013). \n\nRegarding the first referred mechanism, many authors have been using \n\nhydrogels, polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles to encapsulate or immobilize GOx and \n\nto promote a reduction of the pH environment (Traitel et al., 2000;Yoshimoto et al., \n\n2006;Qi et al., 2009;Wu et al., 2012). Qi et al, 2009 produced an insulin particle coated \n\nwith catalase and GOx multilayer shields that promotes insulin release due to pH \n\nchange. In the presence of GOx, glucose is converted in H2O2 and gluconic acid (equation \n\n3) that decreases pH environment levels and therefore, increases permeability of GOx \n\nshell. Reduction of pH levels also increase insulin release since in a more acid pH, insulin \n\nis more soluble. The addition of catalase to the system is an important aspect since H2O2 \n\nlevels produced through GOx reaction can be toxic in vivo causing deactivation of GOx \n\n(Traitel et al., 2000;Gu et al., 2013;Wu et al., 2013). Gu et al, 2013 described a nano-\n\nnetwork of chitosan and alginate nanoparticles encapsulated with insulin, GOx and \n\ncatalase, capable to release insulin through a pH reduction and nano-networks \n\ndissociation. These nano-networks compose a macro scale system, which decreases in \n\nsize through dissociation and therefore, insulin release (Gu et al., 2013).  \n\nMoreover, insulin delivery can also be promoted by glucose competitive binding \n\nto specific proteins, such as concanavalin A (Con A). Yin et al, 2012 reported an insulin \n\nloaded hydrogel based on Con A and dextran, a polysaccharide composed by D-glucose. \n\nIn this system, free glucose competes with dextran for Con A binding, leading to insulin \n\nrelease in the presence of high glucose levels and hydrogel dissociation(Yin et al., 2012). \n\nAnother example of this kind of glucose-sensitive systems is the described by Kim at al, \n\n2001, where a polymeric-Con A complex is produced. Due to free glucose binding to Con \n\nA, the complex dissociates and insulin release is achieved (Kim et al., 2001).  \n\n  \n\n\n\n1.Introduction \n\n24 \n \n\n4. Objectives  \n \n\nThe major goal of this study was to initiate the development of a smart drug \n\ndelivery nanosystem for insulin. This delivery system was aimed to be sensitive to \n\nhyperglycaemic conditions and capable of maintaining glucose blood concentration \n\nwithin physiological values. \n\nThe rationale is based in the ability of GOx to produce H2O2 from glucose, and \n\nthat of catalase to convert H2O2 to O2 as illustrated in fig 1.7. The nanoparticle payload, \n\nco-encapsulated with catalase, should be released as result of pO2 build-up, and \n\nconsequent pore formation on the nanoparticle surface. \n\nFor sequential optimization, PLGA-based nanoparticles conjugated to GOx and \n\nencapsulating catalase, were produced by the W/O/W technique and this procedure was \n\noptimized in order to achieve catalase release in the presence of high glucose levels. \n\nLater on, insulin was co-encapsulated and the system was tested for the release of \n\ninsulin upon H2O2 stimulus.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ncatalase reaction\nO2 production\n\nglucose oxidase reaction\nH2O2 production\n\nCatalase\n\nInsulin\n\nGlucose Oxidase\n\nH2O2\n\nO2\n\nGlucose\n\nGluconic Acid\n+\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nInsulin release\n\nFigure 1.7 Schematic representation of the PLGA-based nanoparticle proposed \n\n\n\n Preparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n25 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.Materials \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPLGA, with a lactide/glycolide molar ratio of 75:25 and an inherent viscosity of \n\n0.22 dl/g (Purac\u00b4s PURASORB) was used.

Formulation of PLGA-nanoparticles \n\n \n\nNanoparticles were produced based on procedures describe in the recent \n\nliterature (Wang et al., 2008;Chen et al., 2014) by the W/O/W method. The polymer \n\nselected was PLGA with a 75:25 ratio (75% lactic acid and 25% glycolic acid).  This PLGA \n\ncomposition has been widely used to encapsulate proteins, such as catalase and insulin \n\n(Sun et al., 2010;Chen et al., 2014;Chen et al., 2015) because PLGA with high lactic acid \n\ncontent shows slower degradation rates and lead to more hydrophobic particles with \n\nless water absorption, slower polymer hydrolysis and slower drug release rate (Mittal et \n\nal., 2007). By contrast, hydrophilic nanoparticles made from PLGA with high glycolic \n\ncontent, suffer fast degradation. An important aspect of PLGA 75:25 is its high glass \n\ntransition temperature (Tg). Tg is the temperature at which the transition of a solid to a \n\nmolten state occurs, and, being high, ensures maintenance of polymer solid state during \n\nstorage as well as in physiological conditions. Tg decreases with molecular weight and \n\nlactic content (Passerini et al., 2001;Kapoor et al., 2015) and, for PLGA 75:25 Tg is \n\napproximately 45\u00b0C.  \n\nA double emulsion method was used for nanoparticle production. DCM was used \n\nto dissolve the polymer and its complete removal was carried out by overnight \n\nevaporation.  \n\n\n\n4.Results and Discussion \n\n38 \n \n\nA key aspect in nanoparticle formulation is the use of surfactants. Higher \n\nconcentrations of surfactants are associated with more stable and smaller nanoparticles, \n\nless aggregation and better physical properties. On the other hand, the risk of toxicity is \n\nhigher and thorough elimination of the surfactant must be through successive washes \n\nwhich is an important step after nanoparticles production. In the present work, 2% PVA \n\nwas used to control surface tension and achieve small mean particle size. (Zambaux et \n\nal., 1998;Sahoo et al., 2002). \n\n \n\n \n\n2. Catalase encapsulation and activity study \n\n \n\nThe objective of this part of this work was to immobilize catalase within PLGA \n\nnanoparticles, while maintaining its activity. Catalase encapsulation was based on Chen \n\net al, 2014. Before immobilization, the solubilisation of catalase was studied in several \n\nconditions and its activity was measured to establish the procedure that leads to the \n\nlowest activity loss. \n\n \n\n2.1.Optimization of catalase activity assay \n\nA reference catalase test was initially established for use in the catalase \n\ndeactivation studies. This reference test sets the specific assay conditions to be later \n\nused to evaluate catalase activity. Following this, the linear activity interval for the \n\nsubstrate and enzyme concentrations was determined.  \n\nThe extension of the reaction was studied by continuous monitoring the \n\nabsorbance at 240 nm during 70 minutes (figure 4.1). Catalase concentrations of 1 U/mL \n\nand 10 U/mL were tested (in 40 mM H2O2 in 500 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.0). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPreparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n39 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTo study catalase activity within nanoparticles, a direct and non-continuous \n\nmethod (3.2.2 at Methods) was needed due to the optical density of nanoparticles in \n\nsuspension which interfered with the absorbance at 240 nm. Following this, a non-\n\ncontinuous method was adopted, where the reaction was stopped and nanoparticles \n\nwere removed by centrifugation, prior to absorbance reading. \n\nThe conditions of the assay were optimized using free catalase in 500 mM \n\nphosphate buffer to which a diluted H2O2 solution was added. The activity assay \n\nprogressed at 25\u00baC and pH 7.0. Catalase activity (figure 4.2) was evaluated at different \n\nenzyme (2.5; 5 and 10 U/mL at 40 mM of H2O2) and substrate concentrations (20, 40 and \n\n80 mM of H2O2; at 5U/mL of catalase). \n\nA decrease in the absorbance at 240 nm with time was observed along with H2O2 \n\nconsumption by catalase, reflected in a negative slope, as illustrated in figure 4.2 (A and \n\nC). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 Extension of H2O2 decomposition by catalase (1 and 10 U/mL) with 40 mM \nH2O2, at 25\u00b0C and pH=7.0. \n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\n0 20 40 60 80\n\nR\ne\n\na\nct\n\nio\nn\n\n e\nx\n\nte\nn\n\nsi\no\n\nn\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nt (min)\n\n10 U/mL\n\n1 U/mL\n\n\n\n4.Results and Discussion \n\n40 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2.B shows a linear variation of the catalase activity between 2.5 and 10 \n\nU/mL using 40 mM of H2O2.

Three different conditions were tested including the use of: ultrasound \n\ndissolution during 10 seconds, vortex dissolution during 1 minute or slow dissolution in \n\nbuffer overnight at 10\u00b0C without stirring (figure 4.3.B) leading to different activities of: \n\n0.477, 0.219 and 0.507 \u00b5mol/min, respectively. These results demonstrate that the \n\ndissolution method strongly influences catalase activity, being ultrasounds and overnight \n\nslow dissolution at 10\u00b0C the best options for catalase dissolution in contrast with vortex \n\nthat shows less than half of the activity observed for the two other options. \n\nThe decision was that catalase should be solubilized in 500 mM phosphate buffer \n\nat pH 7.0, using ultrasounds or overnight slow dissolution at 10\u00b0C. \n\n \n\n2.3.Catalase immobilization \n\n \n\n2.3.1.Process optimization \n\nThe main reason for the use of PLGA-catalase nanoparticles as reported by Chen \n\net al, 2014 was is its capacity to only release its cargo in the presence of 100 \u00b5M H2O2 \n\nwithin the first 15 hours. When the aim is to have a controlled drug release in response \n\nto a specific stimulus, as in this case, minimal cargo release in buffer solution and low \n\nburst release are two necessary conditions. According to the reported work, catalase \n\nwas encapsulated within PLGA nanoparticles by a two step emulsion (W/O/W) process, \n\nbut in contrast to Chen et al, 2014, nanoparticles were dried overnight by speedvac, \n\nwith the purpose of removing water and consequently increasing stability during storage \n\nat -20\u00b0C (Fonte et al., 2012). Unfortunately, this immobilization method led to a very low \n\nand almost undetectable catalase activity. \n\nFollowing this, several attempts were made in order to overcome this issue, \n\nincluding: reducing speedvac drying period to 3 hours, changing buffer for ethanol \n\nduring speedvac drying and lyophilisation. A patented method (Muzykantov et al., 2012) \n\nwas also tested where the first emulsion was produced at subzero temperatures using \n\ndry ice and acetone bath. The second emulsion and all other steps were reproduced \n\nfollowing Chen et al, 2014 procedure, but once again disappointing results were \n\nobtained in respect to the low catalase activity.  \n\n\n\nPreparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n43 \n \n\nIn face of these disappointing results a further attempt was made following \n\nexactly all Chen et al, 2014 protocol conditions, including nanoparticles storage in a \n\nbuffer solution but still, catalase activity was undetectable.  \n\nAfter several trial and error attempts it was found that producing both the first \n\nand second emulsions by sonication, allowed maintaining catalase activity, probably due \n\nto the production of more stable emulsions. The use of this apparently obvious solution \n\nhad been postponed due to the need of spending large quantities of catalase and PLGA \n\nto produce the first emulsion through this method. An optimization of the sonication \n\ntime was also needed. Some attempts to produce these nanoparticles were made with \n\nlarge sonication times (1 minute) according to Chen et al, 2014 protocol, but it caused \n\nhigh activity loss. Reducing the primary emulsion sonication time to 10 seconds was \n\nenough to produce a stable emulsion and retain some catalase activity. In these \n\npreliminary tests catalase activity was evaluated by a visual observation of the oxygen \n\nbubbles produced after H2O2 break down. These preliminary tests were important to \n\ngain some insight on the critical steps during nanoparticle production. Sonication may \n\ninduce protein aggregation and activity loss due to shear stress and high temperatures. \n\nBecause of that, sonication time showed to be a critical step that was optimized in order \n\nto obtain a stable emulsion with minimal catalase deactivation. \n\n \n\n2.3.2.Physical characterization of the nanoparticles produced  \n \n\nAfter this initial optimization, four different formulations were produced (table 3-\n\n1): \n\nA.  Formulation A was based on Chen et al, 2014 protocol including the \n\nabove described changes to improve catalase activity. With the purpose to decrease \n\ncatalase inactivation during nanoparticles formulation, glycerol and BSA were two \n\nadditives tested. According to reported work, glycerol stabilizes catalase native structure \n\nand helps to preserve its activity (Costa et al., 2002). No significant catalase activity \n\ndifferences were observed between these two additives, but both increased the activity \n\nof encapsulated catalase. Following this glycerol was chosen in order to simplify catalase \n\nquantification that would be difficult with addition of another protein to the system.  \n\n\n\n4.Results and Discussion \n\n44 \n \n\nB.  Formulation B was prepared with catalase and 2.5% glycerol in 1% PVA \n\nemulsified within PLGA in DCM (first emulsion) (Costa et al., 2002). \n\nC. The same concentration of 500 mM phosphate buffer was added to \n\nproduce first and second emulsion in formulation C, maintaining osmotic pressure in \n\nboth emulsions and preventing catalase displace from internal to external phase.  \n\nD. Formulation D is a combination of formulation B and C comprising both \n\n2.5% glycerol to produce the first emulsion and the use of phosphate buffer in both \n\nemulsions. \n\nPhysical properties of formulations A\u2013D were studied (table 4-1).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nParticles average size was between 239 and 459 nm, a mean size above 200 nm, \n\nwhich is the appropriate value for therapeutic use (Singh et al., 2009;Sharma et al., \n\n2015). Both formulations A and B show mean particles sizes similar to those obtained by \n\nChen et al, 2014, where a value of 230 nm was obtained. Formulations C and D have a \n\nlarger mean particle size, which appears to be due to the use of phosphate buffer in \n\nboth emulsions. This can be explained by an increased polarity of the second emulsion \n\ndue to the presence of phosphate buffer, which leads to a slower evaporation of DCM \n\ncausing increased coalescence and by this was also an increased particle size (Yang et al., \n\n2001;Wang, 2010). Moreover, glycerol adsorption on particles surface can also promote \n\nan enhanced size (Sameti et al., 2003;Fonte et al., 2012). Besides particle size, \n\nphosphate buffer increases the yield of formulation C, but not formulation D where \n\nglycerol is also present. \n\nThe polydispersity index for all formulations was also evaluated as this parameter \n\ngives information about the distribution of the particles size: a more homogeneous \n\nsystem has a lower polydispersity value. Polydispersity values range from 0 to 1 and a \n\nsystem with a high homogeneous population is characterized by a polydispersity index \n\nTable 4-1 Physical-chemical characterization of different PLGA-catalase nanoparticles \n\n \n\nP\nLG\n\nA\n-c\n\na\nta\n\nla\nse\n\n Formulation Average Size (nm) Polydispersity index Potential Zeta \n(mV) \n\nProcess Yield \n(%) \n\nEE (%) Loading (%) \n\nA 239\u00b15 0.75 -2.9\u00b10.1 63\u00b14 2.9\u00b10.6 0.6\u00b10.1 \nB 275\u00b17 0.21 -2.1\u00b10.5 65\u00b12 2.1\u00b10.2 0.4\u00b10.1 \nC 417\u00b132 0.80 -2.1\u00b10.2 91\u00b14 1.9\u00b10.3 0.4\u00b10.1 \nD 459\u00b110 0.46 -5.1\u00b10.4 64\u00b19 2.8\u00b10.4 0.6\u00b10.1 \n\n\n\nPreparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n45 \n \n\nabove 0.1. Both formulations B and D present the lowest values (0.21 and 0.46, \n\nrespectively), whereas formulation A and C have a polydispersity index of 0.75 and 0.80, \n\nrespectively (Gaumet et al., 2008).  \n\nAll nanoparticles have a zeta potential of -2 mV, except formulation D showing -\n\n5.14 mV. The negative surface charge of the PLGA matrix is the cause of these negative \n\nzeta potential values (Sameti et al., 2003;Fonte et al., 2012). Zeta potential gives \n\ninformation about colloidal suspension stability: particles with zeta potential higher than \n\n+ 30 mV or lower than -30 mV are considered stable colloidal suspensions (Mukherjee et \n\nal., 2008). For all formulations the value is low, which implies poor stability and high \n\naggregation propensity.  \n\nIt is important to overcome stability problems in order to decrease nanoparticles \n\naggregation and chemical instability during storage, such as: polymer hydrolysis and \n\ndrug interactions. Therefore, the lyophilisation of nanoparticles should be chosen as \n\nstorage method to overcome these instability problems.  \n\nSEM images confirmed spherical shape and nanoparticle small size. Figure 4.4 \n\nshows the difference between the smallest (A) and the largest particles (B). It can also be \n\nobserved that formulation D shows a heterogeneous particle size. In accordance to \n\npolydispersity index (table 4-1), formulation D has a more homogeneous population \n\nthan formulation A, which contrast with the SEM images. One possible justification for \n\nthis contrary information is the possibility of particle fusion during SEM observation, due \n\nto high vacuum and electron emission. \n\n\n\n4.Results and Discussion \n\n46 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.3.Encapsulation efficiency  \n\nThe encapsulation efficiency observed is low, not higher than 2.9%, as previously \n\nobserved by Fonte et al, 2015 for the encapsulation of proteins with high lactic acid \n\ncontent PLGA (more hydrophobic) due to decreased PLGA-protein interaction and \n\nconsequently poorer protein encapsulation (Fonte et al., 2015). However, in the present \n\ncase this low efficiency may end up being sufficient for the purpose taking into \n\nconsideration the high efficiency of catalase in the decomposition of H2O2. Moreover, \n\nglycerol presence could have influenced catalase encapsulation due to increased first \n\nemulsion stability, but the encapsulation efficiency was similar for all formulations (table \n\n4-1), meaning that the presence of glycerol and phosphate buffer did not influence \n\nencapsulation. \n\n \n\n2.3.4.Activity and stability  \n\nConcerning catalase activity, the main goal of this study was to evaluate the \n\nadvantages of glycerol and 500 mM phosphate buffer addition in order to increase \n\ncatalase stability and activity. Catalase activity was studied at day zero, when the \n\nnanoparticles were produced and fifteen days after to evaluate stability (figure 4.5).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nB A\n\nA\n\nFigure 4.4 SEM microphotographs of PLGA-catalase formulations: formulation A (A) and \nformulation D (B) (scale bar = 100 nm). \n\n\n\nPreparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n47 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAt day 0, catalase activity of formulations A, B, C and D was 8.1, 14.5, 12.3 and \n\n12.1 \u00b5mol/min, respectively. Nanoparticles formulated using glycerol and phosphate \n\nbuffer in the second emulsion (B, C and D) show higher activity at day 0, when \n\ncomparing with formulation A. In this case, the catalase activity is more than twice \n\nhigher than without using these additives. The results confirm the advantage of using \n\nglycerol in the first emulsion and phosphate buffer in the second one in order to \n\nincrease the activity of encapsulated catalase contributing to reduce enzymatic \n\ndenaturation and the shear stress (Costa et al., 2002). Another possibility that may \n\nexplain the good results obtained with glycerol, is the presence of larger pores within \n\nPLGA matrix formed after glycerol washing, that may contribute to reduced restrictions \n\nfor the diffusion of H2O2, increasing the process efficiency (Real, 2010)  \n\nPrevious results obtained in our laboratory (unpublished) showed that the \n\nstability of free catalase was poor, having a half-life time of approximately three days. \n\nOur expectations were that the immobilization process could increase its stability as \n\nobserved for many other enzymes, including: naringinase, lipase, trypsin and peroxidase \n\n(Mateo et al., 2007;Real, 2010;Montalvo-Ortiz et al., 2012;Du et al., 2013). As described \n\non figure 4.6, increased stability was observed for all the formulations tested in \n\ncomparison to half-life of free catalase (t1/2= 3 days) Formulation A and D shows a half-\n\nlife of 7 days, whereas for formulations B and C  it increases up to 9 and 10 days, \n\nrespectively (figure 4.6).

It is desirable \n\nthat the nanoparticles only release their content whenever H2O2 is present. In the \n\npresence of H2O2, catalase breaks it down into water and oxygen that causes the \n\nformation of pores and the consequent cargo release from the nanoparticles. Following \n\nthis, it is expected that the release of catalase only occurs in the presence of its \n\nsubstrate and that nanoparticles integrity is maintained in its absence. With the purpose \n\nto evaluate this, PLGA \u2013 catalase nanoparticles were incubated in phosphate buffer \n\nalone or containing H2O2. \n\nThe release profile in the absence of H2O2 is presented in figure 4.7 where all \n\nformulations show a minimal catalase release that does not increase significantly with \n\ntime. In the first 24 hours, a maximum of 15, 27, 19 and 20% of catalase release was \n\nachieved in formulations A, B, C and D, respectively. These low values of catalase release \n\nwere constant over 24 hours and can be explained by the release of the catalase \n\nadsorbed onto the surface of the nanoparticles. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6 Stability study of free and encapsulated catalase within PLGA-catalase \nnanoparticles for formulations: A, B, C and D. \n\ny = -0,0953x - 0,0866\nR\u00b2 = 0,9758\n\ny = -0,077x - 0,0883\nR\u00b2 = 0,9784\n\ny = -0,0675x - 0,0353\nR\u00b2 = 0,9615\n\ny = -0,0989x - 0,1941\nR\u00b2 = 0,9359\n\ny = -0,2023x - 0,2485\nR\u00b2 = 0,7794\n\n-2\n\n-1,5\n\n-1\n\n-0,5\n\n0\n\n0 5 10 15\n\nL\no\n\ng\n (\n\nca\nta\n\nla\nse\n\n \nre\n\nsi\nd\n\nu\na\n\nl \na\n\nct\niv\n\nit\ny\n\n)\n\nt (d)\n\nA B C D Free Catalase\n\n\n\nPreparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n49 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn the presence of H2O2 the release profile of catalase from PLGA nanoparticles \n\ncould be described by the Higuchi model (Higuchi, 1963) as it can be observed on figure \n\n4.8. Higuchi purposed a mathematical model that describes drug release from a matrix. \n\nThe drug diffusion process is dependent on the square root of time according to \n\nequation 5, where A is the amount of drug amount released during time t and KH is the \n\nHiguchi dissolution constant: \n\n \n\n? = KH ?  ?\n1/2                                                     (5) \n\n \n\nThe release profile of all formulations studied show a common, and usually \n\nconsidered undesirable feature, consisting on an instant catalase release, known as \n\nburst effect. In this case, burst effect is in fact desirable, meaning that the nanoparticles \n\nwill respond fast to the presence of H2O2. The burst effect may be caused by: low \n\nstability of the first emulsion, catalase adsorption to particles surface and high porosity. \n\nFormulation A and B show the lowest initial catalase release value, approximately \n\nbetween 24% and 33% whereas formulation C and D have a higher burst effect. \n\nFormulations C and D showing approximately 45% of catalase release at 0 h were \n\nselected as the best formulations. \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n0 4 8 24\n\n%\n c\n\na\nta\n\nla\nse\n\n r\ne\n\nle\na\n\nse\nd\n\nt (h)\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nFigure 4.7 Catalase release from PLGA-catalase nanoparticles (A, B, C and D) in 10 mM \nphosphate buffer, pH=7.4, at 37\u00b0 C.

This incomplete release occurs probably due to protein-polymer and protein-\n\nprotein interactions (Fonte et al., 2012), but also in this case formulations C and D were \n\nthe best showing the highest catalase release.

Enzyme activity, stability and functionalization efficiency was \n\nstudied. \n\nA previous activity study with free GOx was performed to understand the ideal \n\nstudying conditions using an indirect method that quantifies the produced H2O2 through \n\nthe formation of a quinoneimine dye complex in the presence of peroxidase. GOx \n\nactivity was studied following the reaction of 1.0 to 4.0 mU/mL of enzyme with 30 mM \n\nof glucose for approximately one hundred minutes (figure 4.9). Further GOx activity \n\nstudies were conducted within forty minutes, ensuring less than 1% reaction extension. \n\nThe absorbance at 520 nm increases with time, after the conversion of the produced \n\nH2O2 into a quinoneimine dye complex, which is reflected by a positive slope of the \n\nlinear regressions, as illustrated on figure 4.10 (A and C).

In the case of GOx the diffusion of the substrate \n\nacross the PLGA nanoparticles is not a limiting factor as for catalase but other factors do \n\nexist such as the possibility of binding of the active site to PLGA which inactivates GOx \n\nand also due to external diffusional limitations of the substrate (Kazenwadel et al., \n\n2015).  \n\nThe stability of GOx activity after immobilization was studied for fifteen days at \n\n25\u00b0C and pH 7.0. The half-life time of the immobilized GOx was found to be 64 days \n\nwhich is similar to the value found for free GOx of 66 days (figure 4.11). In the case of \n\nGOx, its immobilization at the nanoparticle surface didn\u2019t influence its deactivation \n\nprofile. Free GOx was already very stable (t1/2 = 66 days) when compared to free catalase \n\n(t1/2 = 3 days). The increased stability observed for encapsulated catalase (t1/2 = 6-10 \n\ndays, approximately three fold higher than free catalase) and not for GOx shows the \n\nimportance of the encapsulation process to protect the native state of the enzymes in \n\nopposition to the functionalization at the nanoparticles surface. Approximately 0.21 \n\nU/mL of immobilized GOx is capable of producing 20 \u00b5M of H2O2 from 30 mM of glucose \n\nin forty minutes. The glucose concentration used (30 mM) is approximately four times \n\nhigher than blood glucose concentration in hyperglycaemic conditions (7.8 mM), which \n\ncould mean that the small H2O2 amount produced could be insufficient to promote \n\noxygen production by catalase and causing insulin delivery.

Insulin release profile \n\naims to be fast in the presence of H2O2 and minimal in a buffer solution without H2O2. \n\nThe same process used for producing formulation A, was used for producing insulin and \n\ncatalase loaded nanoparticles (formulation AI). The process used for formulation D was \n\nnow used for nanoparticles loaded with insulin (formulation DI). \n\nThe encapsulation efficiency of insulin was 11.3 and 36.4% for formulation AI and \n\nDI, respectively (table 4-3). This large difference may be due to the high stability of the \n\nfirst emulsion in case of formulation DI, where glycerol is present, however it did not \n\ninfluence catalase encapsulation (table 4-1).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nInsulin release profile was studied in a similar way as for catalase, except for H2O2 \n\nconcentration solution and protein quantification method. In detail, the high H2O2 \n\nconcentration used in catalase release assay was replaced by 100 \u00b5M of H2O2, which is a \n\ncloser value to what may be achieved in endogenous conditions and was already used \n\nby Chen et al, 2014 to mimic H2O2 concentrations detected in hypoxic tumours. Insulin \n\nwas quantified by HPLC (figure 4.12) instead of using Bradford assay to avoid \n\ninterference from the presence of another protein, catalase, and also a higher precision \n\nis achieved by HPLC (Wang et al., 2008). Insulin release was analyzed after incubation \n\nwith phosphate buffer with or without H2O2. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4-3 Physical and chemical characterization of different PLGA-catalase-insulin nanoparticles \nformulations \n\nP\nLG\n\nA\n-c\n\na\nta\n\nla\nse\n\n-\n\nin\nsu\n\nli\nn\n\n \n\nFormulation Average Size \n(nm) \n\nPolydispersity \nindex \n\nPotential Zeta \n(mV) \n\nProcess Yield \n(%) \n\nEE (%) Loading (%) \n\nAI 266\u00b121 0.70 -3.0\u00b10.1 35.3 11.3 0.22 \nDI 485\u00b120 0.72 -5.1\u00b10.2 35.8 36.4 0.71 \nG --- --- --- 23.6 15.2 0.25 \nH 405\u00b1156 0.80 -5.2\u00b10.1 36.2 31.5 0.62 \nI 740\u00b1215 0.73 -3.8\u00b10.3 35.7 33.9 0.67 \n\n \n\n\n\nPreparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n55 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAs well as for catalase, insulin release profile can be described by Higuchi\u2019s model \n\nfor drug release. Insulin release in formulation AI did not show any differences between \n\nbuffer alone or with H2O2, showing an initial 10% release and approximately 35% after 3 \n\nhours (figure 4.13.A). This burst release of insulin may be caused by the release of \n\nadsorbed insulin on PLGA surface. In this case, the burst release effect is undesirable, \n\nbut worse than that is the fact that insulin release doesn\u2019t seem to be triggered by H2O2 \n\nbut only by diffusion since both release profiles with and without H2O2 are identical. \n\nConcerning this issue, formulation DI (figure 4.13.B) behaves a little bit better but it also \n\nshows a similar burst release of 7% and only a slight difference between the insulin \n\nrelease profiles in buffer comparing to H2O2 solution starting at 0.5 hours.

An increased catalase amount was used in formulation G, \n\nto increase oxygen production and produce more numerous and bigger porous when \n\nH2O2 was present. Another strategy was to dry the nanoparticles instead of storing them \n\nin a buffer solution. By doing this, we aimed to decrease the pore size that for instance \n\ncould be too large in order to avoid insulin leaching.

Speedvac is a process to evaporate solvents under vacuum and \n\nheat, not often used to dry nanoparticles. In contrast, lyophilisation is a widely used \n\ntechnique to dry nanoparticles based on removing water from a frozen sample by \n\nsublimation. This technique is extensively used to promote and increased physical \n\nstabilization of nanoparticles for a long period of time. Both techniques promote water \n\nelimination from nanoparticles which can reduce surface pore number and size. \n\nComparing formulations DI, G, H and I, formulations DI, H and I, show similar \n\nvalues for yield, encapsulation efficiency and loading (table 4-3) reflecting the use of the \n\nsame formulation process except the drying step. Only formulation G shows a lower \n\nvalue for insulin encapsulation. One possible explanation for this is the competition \n\nbetween insulin and catalase for the entrapment, leading to an insulin entrapment \n\ndecrease due to the higher catalase content. An enhanced catalase amount used during \n\nencapsulation (formulation G) didn\u2019t however promote a better insulin release in the \n\npresence of H2O2, probably because the porous polymer structure was maintained \n\ncausing insulin leaching once again (figure 4.14.A).  \n\nIn formulation H, mean particle size and zeta potential have similar values to \n\nformulation D (PLGA-catalase) and formulation DI (PLGA-catalase-insulin), since all these \n\nformulations are composed by the same constituents. Moreover, catalase was active \n\n(observable at naked eye) and insulin encapsulation was 31.54% (table 4-2). Insulin \n\nrelease was approximately 10% at 0h; increasing to 15% independently of being in the \n\npresence of H2O2 (figure 4.14.B). In comparison with insulin release profile of \n\nformulation DI, a reduced insulin release occurs at 1 hour which can be explained by a \n\nreduced pore size. However, no differences were observed regarding insulin release in \n\nthe presence or absence of H2O2. Although no information was found in literature about \n\nhow speedvac may influence the production of PLGA nanoparticles, the temperature \n\ninside the speedvac may reach 30\u00b0C, which may contribute to catalase deactivation. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n4.Results and Discussion \n\n58 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFormulation I was freeze dried during 24 hours and its physical properties, insulin \n\nencapsulation and release profile were compared with formulation H.

However, insulin release profile was reduced and only a minimal amount of \n\ninsulin, approximately 5%, was released after 1 hour both in buffer and in H2O2 solution \n\n(figure 4.15). To this result is added the fact that the mean particle size of formulation I \n\nis 740 nm, highly above the other formulations particles size (table 4-3). Taken together, \n\nthese results indicate particles aggregation that lead to a decreased surface area and \n\nFigure 4.14 Insulin release from PLGA-catalase-insulin nanoparticles at 37\u00b0C and pH \n7.4 from formulation G (A); formulation H (B) \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1\n\n%\n i\n\nn\nsu\n\nli\nn\n\n r\ne\n\nle\na\n\nse\nd\n\nt (h)\n\nB\n\nBuffer\n\n100 \u00b5M H2O2\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1\n\n%\n i\n\nn\nsu\n\nli\nn\n\n r\ne\n\nle\na\n\nse\nd\n\nt (h)\n\nA\n\nBuffer\n\n100 \u00b5M H2O2\n\n\n\nPreparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n59 \n \n\nreduced buffer contact/penetration into particles. Therefore, low insulin release is \n\nachieved. No differences in insulin release in the presence or absence of H2O2 was \n\nachieved probably due to low catalase activity. A possible explanation for the low \n\ncatalase activity is the lyophilisation process itself, due to the cold shock and ice-water \n\ninterfaces (Shikama et al., 1961;Panyam et al., 2003;Lale et al., 2011). In fact, some \n\ndrawbacks are known for lyophilisation such as aggregation and mechanical stress \n\nrelated to alterations of protein stability and release profile (Fonte et al., 2012). \n\nMoreover, an excessive pore reduction can also be the reason for the minimal insulin \n\nrelease observed. Less and more reduced pores decrease H2O2 diffusion through PLGA \n\nnanoparticles, which decreases oxygen production. Pore size shall be large enough to \n\nallow H2O2 fast diffusion but not so large that cause insulin leaching. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBoth formulation H and I were also studied by SEM (figure 4.16), where glycerol \n\npresence was found.

Besides glycerol presence in \n\nboth formulations H and I, is possible to observe particle aggregation of formulation H \n\nand I.

However, nanoparticles aggregation was also found in \n\nformulation H (figure 4.16.A) which contrasts with a mean particle size of approximately \n\n406 nm. This contradictory information can be due to SEM technique conditions, such as \n\nhigh vacuum and temperatures that can promote nanoparticles fusion. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nComparing the size of insulin and catalase (figure 4.17), insulin is much smaller as \n\nconfirmed by its hydrodynamic radius of 11 \u00c5 (Mw = 5 kDa) in relation to catalase with \n\n50 \u00c5 (Mw= 250 kDa) (Hovgaard et al., 1996;Harding, 1999;Brodin et al., 2015). Based on \n\nthis and regarding both catalase and insulin release profiles studied, we can justify the \n\nfast insulin release observed without H2O2 may be due to its small size. The reduced \n\ninsulin size promotes an easy escape of insulin though the porous PLGA nanoparticles \n\nstructure. To solve this issue in future experiments a larger insulin molecule could be \n\nused. According to reported work, pegylated insulin hexamers are molecules with an \n\nincreased molecular weight of approximately 300 kDa (Lim et al., 2011). Having an \n\ninsulin molecule with a similar molecular weight as catalase it is expected that insulin \n\nrelease profile changes and approaches catalase release profile. Therefore, pegylated \n\ninsulin hexamers should be released only in the presence of H2O2 with a minimal release \n\nin its absence. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.16 SEM microphotographs of PLGA-catalase formulations at 100 nm (A) Formulation H (B) \nFormulation I \n\n\n\nPreparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n61 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 4.17 Comparison between the size of catalase (A) and insulin (B).

Concluding Remarks and Future Perspectives  \n\n \n\nOptimization of a PLGA nanoparticles formulation containing catalase, insulin and \n\nGOx was performed, towards the development of a glucose sensitive insulin delivery \n\nsystem.  \n\nCatalase was encapsulated in PLGA showing three fold increased stability over \n\ntime comparing to free catalase. A release profile could be observed in response to the \n\npresence of H2O2. Also, the addition of glycerol and phosphate buffer to the formulation \n\nwas concluded to be more benefic to catalase stability and release. PLGA nanoparticles \n\nwere decorated with GOx and a high enzymatic activity and stability over time were \n\nachieved. \n\nPLGA nanoparticles co-encapsulating catalase and insulin were also successfully \n\nproduced. Several attempts to control insulin release were studied, highlighting the \n\ninfluence of the formulation process in the particle structure and surface characteristics. \n\nIn contrast to the good results initially observed for the release profile of catalase, \n\ninsulin release was not triggered by the presence of H2O2. Insulin was released from \n\nPLGA nanoparticles even in the absence of H2O2. It is possible that the optimized \n\nimmobilization conditions for catalase are not suitable for insulin. Most probably the \n\nPLGA surface porosity is too large to prevent insulin from leaching, since insulin is \n\nsmaller than catalase. \n\nFurther optimization must be conducted with the objective of better \n\nunderstanding and controlling insulin leaching and to achieve a formulation where \n\ninsulin release is triggered by the presence of H2O2 only. An approach to overcome rapid \n\ninsulin release from PLGA nanoparticles can be its encapsulation in a more complex \n\nformulation, such as pegylated insulin hexamers. Pegylated insulin hemaxamer molecule \n\n(300 kDa) has a similar molecular weight to catalase (250 kDa) and due to that it may \n\npromote a reduced insulin release from PLGA nanoparticles in non-stimulus conditions.  \n\n\n\nPreparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n63 \n \n\nAfter the production of a PLGA-catalase-insulin system adequate to the \n\ntherapeutic effect, PLGA-catalase-insulin decorated with surface GOx should be studied \n\nand a possible GOx immobilization optimization shall be further conducted. Based on \n\nthese optimizations, an insulin delivery system sensitive to blood glucose concentrations \n\nshall be achieved. Finally, in vitro assays to ensure biocompatibility and in vivo studies to \n\nevaluate bioavailability and therapeutic effect also need to be performed.  \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPreparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\n65 \n \n\n \n\n5.References \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAbdelwahed, W., Degobert, G., Stainmesse, S. and Fessi, H.
