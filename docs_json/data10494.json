Sines holds one of the most \n\nimportant deep-water ports which contains oil-bearing, petrochemical, liquid bulk, coal and container \n\nterminals. The port and its industrial infrastructures are facing the ocean southwest towards the main \n\nseismogenic sources. This work considers two different seismic zones: the Southwest Iberian Margin \n\nand the Gloria Fault. Within these two regions, we selected a total of six scenarios to assess the tsunami \n\nimpact at the test site. The deterministic approach consists in solving linear and non-linear shallow water \n\nequations using an explicit leap-frog scheme to obtain water elevations in predefined grids for a defined \n\ntime step. Numerical model computation process is launched after defining an initial seafloor \n\ndisplacement on a prepared set of nested grids. The Digital Elevation Model includes bathymetric and \n\ntopographic information with 10m resolution in the study area. To do the tsunami simulations a Non-\n\nlinear Shallow Water Model With Nested Grids \u2013 NSWING is used. In this study, the static effect of \n\ntides is analysed for three different tidal stages. Tsunami impact scenarios are described in terms of \n\ninundation area, maximum values of wave height, flow depth, drawback, run-up and inundation \n\ndistance. Synthetic waveforms are computed for virtual tide gauges at specific locations outside and \n\ninside the harbour. The final results describe the impact at Sines test site considering the different source \n\nscenarios at mean sea level, the aggregate scenario and the influence of the tide on the aggregate \n\nscenario. The results confirm the composite source Horseshoe and Marques Pombal fault as the worst \n\ncase tsunami scenario. It governs the aggregate scenario with about 60% and inundates an area of \n\n3.5km\u00b2.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKey-words: Deterministic tsunami hazard assessment, numerical modelling, aggregate scenarios, \n\nintegrated hazard maps.  \n\n\n\n  \n\niv \n\n \n\nResumo \n\nNeste trabalho apresenta-se uma abordagem determin\u00edstica de perigo de tsunamis considerando \n\nm\u00faltiplas fontes para a cidade costeira de Sines, Portugal. Tsunamis ou maremotos s\u00e3o eventos \n\nextremos, energeticamente elevados mas pouco frequentes. Normalmente s\u00e3o geradas por um \n\ndeslocamento duma grande quantidade de \u00e1gua seja por erup\u00e7\u00f5es volc\u00e1nicas, collapse de caldeiras, \n\ndeslizamentos de massa, meteorites ou terramotos submarinos. A grande maioria \u00e9 causado pelos \n\nterramotos submarinos. Neste trabalho estuda-se s\u00f3mente efeitos causado por tsunamis gerados pelos \n\ndeslocamentos de solo submarino devido a terramotos. O evento no oceano \u00cdndico em 2004 demonstrou \n\na necessidade de um sistema de alerta operacional global. E o Tohoku terramoto em 2011 moustrou as \n\nlimita\u00e7\u00f5es do conhecimento cient\u00edfico respetivamente \u00e0s zonas fontes, os impactos costeiros e medidas \n\nde mitiga\u00e7\u00e3o. A partir desta data na zona Noreste Atlantico e Mediterr\u00e2neo e mares adjacentes (NEAM) \n\nesfor\u00e7os foram feitos para melhorar as capacidades de avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de perigo de tsunamis. Em Portugal a \n\nzona considerada mais ativa \u00e9 o Golfo de Cadiz. Relatos hist\u00f3ricos antigos voltam atr\u00e1s at\u00e9 60 BC, mas \n\nevid\u00eancias geol\u00f3gicas mostram eventos energeticamente elevadas at\u00e9 218 BC.  \n\nA costa portuguesa \u00e9 altamente exposta ao perigo de um tsunami a partir de fontes tect\u00f3nicas ativas \n\nlocais e regionais. A zona principal tsunamigenica \u00e9 o SWIM (Margem sudoeste da Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica), \n\nque inclui numerosas falhas inversas que mergulham em direc\u00e7\u00e3o sudeste. O evento mais rigoroso foi o \n\n1\u00ba Novembro 1755 causado pelo famoso terramoto de Lisboa com mais do que dez mil v\u00edtimas mortais \n\ne uma magnitude estimada de 8.5. A fonte do tsunami ainda n\u00e3o \u00e9 conhecida definitivamente, pois na \n\naltura ainda n\u00e3o havia instrumentos para registrar sismos. A fonte foi aproximada por diferentes autores \n\nutilizando as informa\u00e7\u00f5es hist\u00f3ricos e assuma-se que \u00e9 localizada na zona SWIM. O impacto do tsunami \n\nocorreu na bacia inteira do ocenao Atl\u00e2ntico Norte com maior impacto na Ib\u00e9ria e em Moroccos. No \n\nseculo 20 no dia 28 de Fevereiro 1969 um sismo de magnitude 7.9 causou um tsunami pequeno com \n\numa amplitude de 0.5m em Lagos e Cascais. As ondas aproximaram-se da costa por volta das 3 de \n\nmanha em condi\u00e7\u00f5es mar\u00e9 vazia e n\u00e3o causaram danos significativos. \n\nO trabalho foi desenvolvido no ambito do projeto ASTARTE [Grant 603839]. Em Sines encontra-se um \n\ndos portos mais importantes de agua profunda de Portugal contenido terminais petrol\u00edferos, \n\npetroqu\u00edmicos, graneis l\u00edquidos, carv\u00e3o e contentores. O porto est\u00e1 ligado aos centros industriais em \n\nSines com infraestruturas frageis como gasoduto, oleodutos, tanques de g\u00e1s natural liquefeito ou \n\ncintur\u00f5es industriais, quais ocorrem o risco de ser danificados. Possiveis danos geram riscos addicionais \n\ncomo explus\u00f5es ou polui\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais. Na zona sul da area do estudo encontra-se o central \n\nthermoeletrico da EDP que utliza a \u00e1gua do mar pelo arrefecimento dos geradores. Sines tamb\u00e9m e um \n\ndestino tur\u00edstico com um porto de recreio e com varias praias associadas aos desportos n\u00e1uticos como a \n\npesca deportiva, a vela, o mergulho e o surf. A zona de estudo inclui o porto de recreio e as praias de \n\nVasco da Gama e de S\u00e3o Torpes. O porto, o central thermoel\u00e9trico e as suas infrastruturas industriais e \n\nas praias enfrentam ao Atlantico a sudoeste direcionado \u00e0s zonas principais de rupturas s\u00edsmicas \n\nconsideradas suficientemente fortes de causar tsunamis e por causa disso a zona de estudo escolhido \u00e9 \n\naltamente exposto ao perigo dum tsunami. Foram consideradas as zonas de fontes a falha da Gloria (GF) \n\ne a zona da margem sudoeste da pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica (SWIM) e cinco falhas diferentes, nomeadamentes: \n\nA falha da Gloria que \u00e9 uma falha de cisalhamento que defina a fronteira entre Eurasia e Nubia; a falha \n\nde Cadiz Wedge (CWF) que \u00e9 considerada como uma zona de subduc\u00e7\u00e3o e as falhas do banco de \n\nGorringe (GBF), de Ferradura (HSF) e de Marques Pombal (MPF) que s\u00e3o falhas inversas que \n\nmergulham em direc\u00e7\u00e3o sudeste. Adicionalmente foi considerado uma combina\u00e7\u00e3o da falha de ferradura \n\ne da falha Marques Pombal (HSMPF) para a simula\u00e7\u00e3o. Um ruptura simult\u00e2nea de falhas com \n\npar\u00e2metros parecidos foi proposta por varios autores como uma poss\u00edvel fonte do tsunami em 1755. A \n\nzona SWIM \u00e9 considerado uma zona complexa em termos geodin\u00e2micos onde varios processos atuam \n\nsimultaneamente. Para cada falha identificada e para a combina\u00e7\u00e3o HSMPF o pior dos cen\u00e1rios s\u00edsmicos \n\nfoi assumido para o procedimento da modela\u00e7\u00e3o num\u00e9rica.  \n\nA abordagem deterministica consiste em resolver as equa\u00e7\u00f5es lineares e n\u00e3o-lineares de \u00e1gua pouca \n\nprofunda para puder obter as eleva\u00e7\u00f5es da superf\u00edcie livre do oceano em cada passo tempo definido. As \n\nequa\u00e7\u00f5es de \u00e1gua pouca profunda s\u00e3o v\u00e1lidas devido do facto que tsunamis s\u00e3o ondas longas. Ondas \n\ns\u00e3o consideradas longas quando o seu comprimento de onda ? \u00e9 muito maior  que a altura de coluna de \n\nagua ? ou quando se verifica \n?\n\n?\n<\n\n1\n\n25\n (Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, 2013).   \n\n\n\n  \n\nv \n\n \n\nNa simula\u00e7\u00e3o num\u00e9rica da propaga\u00e7\u00e3o do tsunami  \u00e9 utilizado modelo NSWING (Non-linear Shallow \n\nWater Model with Nested Grids) (Miranda et al., 2014) que resolve as equa\u00e7\u00f5es de \u00e1gua pouca profunda \n\nutilizando um esquema \u201cleap-frog\u201d expl\u00edcito para os termos lineares e um esquema \u201cupwind\u201d para os \n\ntermos n\u00e3o-lineares. Ap\u00f3s definir o deslocamento inicial do fundo do oceano o modelo calcula as \n\nsolu\u00e7\u00f5es para cada cen\u00e1rio dentro de um sistema de grelhas encastradas. Para poder calcular os \n\ndeslocamentos iniciais aplicando a teoria de inelasticidade de Okada (1985) foram utilizados par\u00e2metros \n\npresentados de campanhas e estudos recentes. Foi aplicado uma distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dum slip n\u00e3o uniforme \n\nonde o slip defina o deslocamento inicial em cada c\u00e9lula da grelha. Este deslocamento inicial e traduzida \n\npela superf\u00edcie livre onde o processo num\u00e9rico da propaga\u00e7\u00e3o do modelo come\u00e7a e as equa\u00e7\u00f5es de \u00e1gua \n\npouca profunda s\u00e3o resolvidas em cada passo tempo para cada c\u00e9lula de sistema de grelhas ligadas. \n\nNeste estudo o sistema das grelhas encastradas ou \u201cnested grids\u201d consiste num conjunto de quatro \n\ngrelhas ligadas. Na zona fonte e em oceano aberto utiliza-se uma grelha com c\u00e9lulas maiores. C\u00e9lulas \n\nde 640x640m reduzindo-as para 10x10m quando se atinge a zona de estudo. Usam-se duas grelhas \n\ninterm\u00e9dias 160m e 40m aplicando um fator de refinamento de 4. Para puder analisar efeitos locais com \n\nessa resolu\u00e7\u00e3o alta precisa-se um DEM (modelo digital de terreno) com informa\u00e7\u00f5es detalhadas sobre a \n\nbathimetria e a topografia da area de estudo. O DEM foi elaborado utilzando um conjunto de dados do \n\nInstituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico de Portugal e da Dire\u00e7\u00e3o-geral do Territ\u00f3rio num SIG (sistema de informa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ngeogr\u00e1fica). A inunda\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 obtida a partir dum algoritmo designado \u201cmoving boundary-percurso da \n\nlinha de costa\u201d baseado em c\u00e9lulas secas e c\u00e9lulas inundadas para conseguir seguir a linha da costa (Liu \n\net al., 1995). \n\nTamb\u00e9m foi considerado o efeito da mar\u00e9. Os valores de mar\u00e9 chei\u00e1 foram obtidos calculando a m\u00e9dia \n\ndas m\u00e9dias de todas as Preias-mar e da mar\u00e9 vazia a m\u00e9dia das m\u00e9dias de todas as Baixas-mar de 2012 \n\nat\u00e9 2014. Para cada cen\u00e1rio foram calculadas tr\u00eas condi\u00e7\u00f5es de mar\u00e9, da condi\u00e7\u00e3o mar\u00e9 cheia, do nivel \n\nm\u00e9dio do mar e da condi\u00e7\u00e3o mar\u00e9 vazia. \n\nOs resultados finais s\u00e3o apresentados em forma de mapas integrados de perigo para cada cen\u00e1rio \n\nconsiderado e para o cen\u00e1rio agregado. Cada mapa integrada de perigo consiste em  valores m\u00e1ximos \n\nde altura de onda (MWH), profundidade de fluxo (MFD), recuo (MDB), runup (MRU) e dist\u00e2ncia de \n\ninunda\u00e7\u00e3o do cen\u00e1rio correspondente. Formas de ondas sint\u00e9ticas foram calculadas em pontos da grelha \n\ndesignados por mar\u00e9grafos virtuais em pontos representativos dentro e fora do porto. Os resultados finais \n\ndescrevem o impacto em Sines considerando cada \u00fanico cen\u00e1rio de n\u00edvel m\u00e9dio do mar, o cen\u00e1rio \n\nagregado e a influ\u00eancia da mar\u00e9 no cen\u00e1rio agregado. Os resultados confirmam que o pior caso cen\u00e1rio \n\n\u00e9 a combina\u00e7\u00e3o da falha de ferradura e da falha Marques Pombal HSMPF. Este cen\u00e1rio domina o cen\u00e1rio \n\nagregado com aproximadamente 60% e inunda uma \u00e1rea de 3.5km\u00b2. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Abordagem determin\u00edstica do perigo de tsunami, modela\u00e7\u00e3o num\u00e9rica, cen\u00e1rios \n\nagregados, mapas de perigo integrados. \n\n\n\n  \n\nvi \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nI would like to thank Maria Ana Baptista, Jorge Miguel Miranda and Rachid Omira for their great \n\nsupport and fruitful discussions throughout the entire investigation process, Carlos Antunes for \n\nproviding the GPS RTK equipment of Lisbon Faculty of Sciences, Commandant Jos\u00e9 Brazuna Fontes \n\nof Sines harbour for his support for the field survey and Dire\u00e7\u00e3o Geral do Territ\u00f3rio for making available \nLIDAR data of the study area. \n\nI wish to express my thanks to my family for their support, especially my parents Ursula and G\u00fcnter \n\nWronna, my sister Edith Wronna, my Grandmother Christine Achleitner and my aunt Gertrude Kneissl. \n\nAnd I wish to express my gratefulness to my girlfriend Maria Fuchs for her patience and mental \n\nmotivation.

Introduction  \n\nTsunamis are low frequency but high impact hazards for coastal societies. Tsunamis are sets of waves \n\nproduced by an abrupt displacement of a large amount of water. Generating processes are usually \n\ngeologic activities such as earthquakes, volcanic eruption or landslides. Rare meteorite impacts extreme \n\nmeteorological events for example abrupt atmospheric pressure jumps may also cause Tsunamis. The \n\nterm tsunami originates from the Japanese \u201ctsu\u201d what means harbour and \u201cnami\u201d what means wave. \n\nFisherman used it to describe flooding waves that sometimes destroyed the harbours. Submarine \n\nearthquakes trigger the great majority of tsunamis. Also from distant sources their impact can be \n\ntremendous. But not all submarine earthquake cause tsunamis only those that produce sufficient vertical \n\nseafloor deformation and dislocate the entire water column above. To prepare and protect coastal \n\nsocieties it is fundamental to understand better their impact at coastal shorelines. To understand better \n\ntheir nature scientists run numerical models to take precautions. \n\nBasic terms and physical quantities used in the thesis are presented in table 1.1. Some physical quantities \n\nmentioned are depicted in Fig. 1.1.  \n\nTable 1.1 Basic terms and definitions used in this thesis. \n\nAmplitude: Height of the crest of the tsunami above mean sea level. \n\nBathymetry: The measurement of the depth of the ocean floor from the water surface. \n\nTopography: The measurement of the elevation of the land surface from the sea level. \n\nWave Height: \nThe wave height is measured as the difference between wave crest and \n\ntrough in a certain point. \n\nFlow Depth or Inundation Depth: \nDepth or height of the tsunami above the ground in the inundation zone. \n\nIt measures the thickness of the water layer on land. \n\nInundation or inundation distance: \nThe horizontal distance in land that a tsunami penetrates; is measured \n\nperpendicular to the shoreline. \n\nMaximum inundation area: Maximum horizontal penetration of the tsunami inland \n\nMean Lower Low Water (MLLW): The average of all the lower low water heights over a specific period. \n\nMean Sea Level (MSL): \n\nThe MSL is given by the arithmetic mean of hourly heights of tide height \n\non the open coast or in adjacent waters which have free access to the sea, \n\nobserved over a specific time period. The MSL is often used as geodetic \n\ndatum. \n\nMean Higher High Water (MHHW): The average of all the higher high water heights over a specific period. \n\nMaximum Drawback: \nThe maximum drawback gives the maximum area that remains dry \n\noffshore as the result of the tsunami arrival in the test site. \n\nRun Up: \n\nThe maximum water elevation within the limit of inundation; this is \n\nusually greater than the wave amplitude at the coast. The run up height \n\n(or the elevation reached by the seawater) is measured relative to some \n\ngiven reference datum. In most studies and is referenced to MSL. In this \n\nthesis Run Up is referenced to MLLW, MSL or MHHW depending on \n\nthe tide considered. \n\nPeriod: Time interval between two consecutive wave crests or troughs. \n\nRecurrence or Return Period: \n\nAn interval of time long enough to encompass many events divided by \n\nthe number of events equal or greater than a specific magnitude that are \n\nexpected to occur. \n\nTsunami Travel Time: \nTime required for the first tsunami wave to propagate from its source to a \n\ngiven point on a coastline. \n\nTsunamigenic: Capable of producing a tsunami. \n\n \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     2 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 Schematic illustration of physical quantities such as amplitude, wave height, flow depth, run \nup and inundation distance referenced to a given sea level. \n\nThe 26th December, 2004 Indian Ocean and the 11th March, 2011 Tohoku-Oki striking tsunami events \n\nraised awareness due to the enormous loss of life and property. The Indian Ocean event in 2004 \n\ndemonstrated the need for operational early warning systems around the world. However, seven years \n\nlater, the 2011 Tohoku-Oki event showed the limitations of the scientific knowledge concerning tsunami \n\nsources, coastal impacts, and mitigation measures. Since then, in the NEAM region (North East Atlantic, \n\nMediterranean and connected seas) many efforts have been addressed to understand better the \n\ntsunamigenic sources and to improve the tsunami hazard assessment capabilities. Within the NEAM \n\nregion, the Gulf of Cadiz is among the most tsunami hazardous areas. The historical reports include \n\nevents dated back to 60 BC (Mendon\u00e7a, 1758, Baptista and Miranda, 2009; Kaabouben et al., 2009). \n\nHowever, the geological evidence indicates that high energy events occurred back to 218 BC (Luque et \n\nal., 2001). \n\nThis study was developed in the framework of ASTARTE project \u201cAssessment, STrategy And Risk \n\nReduction for Tsunamis in Europe\u201d [Grant 603839]. The project uses nine test sites in the North East \n\nAtlantic and Mediterranean (NEAM) Region. The test site selection considered that: \n\n? Test sites can be impacted by regional and local tsunami sources, which put different levels of \nstress on detection and forecasting \n\n? Different tsunami source types, such as earthquakes, landslides, volcanoes and rockslides, some \nof which not included in NEAMTWS \n\n? Different values at risk including industry, harbours and other infrastructures, and ecosystems \n\n? Different coastal communities such as fishing communities, coastal cities and tourist \ndevelopments \n\n? Test sites include a broad geographical coverage, in both North-east Atlantic and Mediterranean \ncoasts \n\nIn Portugal the test site is the city of Sines. The study area consists of different topographic features like \n\nbeaches, rocks, rocky outcrops, plains and smaller river course valleys and is interfered by big harbour \n\nand industrial structures.  \n\nThe Portuguese coast is exposed to tsunami threat from local and regional tectonic sources \n\n(Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, 2013). The main tsunamigenic area is the SWIM \n\n(South West Iberian Margin), with some considerable SE dipping inverse faults (Zitellini et al., 2009, \n\nMatias et al., 2013). The most severe tsunami occurred on November 1st 1755. The tsunami followed \n\nthe Lisbon earthquake with an estimated magnitude of 8.5 by Martins and Mendes Victor (1990). The \n\nevent caused more than 900 casualties exclusively due to the tsunami (Baptista et al., 1998a). This \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     3 \n\nmagnitude was more recently re-evaluated by Solares and Arroyo (2004) with an estimate of 8.5\u00b10.3. \n\nThe tsunami hit the entire northern Atlantic basin with huge impact in Iberia and Morocco (Baptista and \n\nMiranda, 2009). In the 20th century, the February 28th, 1969 earthquake with a magnitude of 7.9 (Fukao, \n\n1973) caused a small tsunami of 0.5 m amplitude in Lagos and Cascais (Baptista et al., 1992; Baptista \n\nand Miranda, 2009). The tsunami waves hit the coast in low tide conditions at circa 3 a.m. (Baptista et \n\nal., 1992) and no significant damage was observed.  \n\nThe second tsunamigenic zone to be considered is the Gloria Fault. The Gloria fault is a segment of the \n\nEurasia-Nubia plate boundary. It is a large strike slip fault, located between 24\u00baW and 19\u00baW, with scarce \n\nseismic activity. Nonetheless, this area was the location of several large events during the 20th Century, \n\nin particular the November 25th, 1941 earthquake, a submarine strike-slip event of magnitude 8.3-8.4 \n\n(Gutenberg and Richter, 1949) and the May 26th, 1975 with magnitude 7.9 (Lynnes and Ruff, 1985; \n\nGrimson and Chen, 1986). \n\nIn recent years, a considerable number of tsunami hazard assessment studies were published for the \n\nNorth East Atlantic area. Most studies focus on the tsunami impact in the Gulf of Cadiz using a scenario \n\nbased or deterministic approach, namely: Lima et al. (2010), Omira et al. (2010), Omira et al. (2011), \n\nAtillah et al. (2011), Baptista et al. (2011a), Renou et al. (2011), Omira et al. (2013), Benchekroun et al. \n\n(2013) and Lemos et al. (2014).  \n\nActually, two different assessment methods are used to study the tsunami impact at a certain test site, \n\nthe PTHA (Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment) and DTHA or SBTHA (Deterministic Tsunami \n\nHazard Assessment or Scenario Based Tsunami Hazard Assessment).  \n\nThe PTHA approach consists in considering the recurrence rates of earthquake scenarios with different \n\nmagnitudes. By knowing the recurrence rates of the different magnitude scenarios a database is \n\ngenerated using numerical modelling methods. Apart from this results a probability exceeding a certain \n\nwave height/flow depth in a given period is assessed. Recently, Omira et al. (2015) published a \n\nprobabilistic tsunami hazard assessment for the North East Atlantic. These studies gain in reliability the \n\nlonger the geological databases reach back. Another method used in PTHA is to apply an aleatory \n\nstatistical tool called Monte Carlo simulations (e.g. Ten Brink et al., 2009, Grilli et al., 2009, S\u00f8renson \n\net al., 2012). \n\nThe DTHA or SBTHA methodology consists of studying the impact of specific tsunami events \u2013 \n\ntsunami scenarios - in the study area. Usually the specific tsunami events are based on geological \n\ninformation considering the Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) scenario or the Worst-case Credible \n\nTsunami Scenarios (WCTS) considering the typical fault (TFs) of the source zones in the study area. \n\nNumerical simulation of the chosen scenarios calculates the tsunami impact in the test-site. By \n\nestimating parameters as wave height, flow depth, drawback, inundation distance hazard maps are \n\nelaborated. This methodology has been applied to assess tsunami hazard around the globe (e.g. Baptista \n\net al., 2011a, Tonini et al., 2011, Mitsoudis et al., 2012, Phuong et al., 2014, Wijetunge, 2014). The \n\ndeterministic approach is more suitable to establish tsunami mitigation measures and coastal \n\nmunicipality authorities.   \n\nIn this master thesis, the DTHA approach has been used to evaluate the tsunami impact in Sines. The \n\nimpact is described in terms of maximum wave height (MWH), maximum flow depth (MFD), maximum \n\nrun up (MRU) and maximum drawback (MDB). Further the aggregate scenario has been built plotting \n\nthe MWH in each cell considering the contribution of the individual scenarios (Tinti et al., 2011).The \n\nstudy area contains the country\u2019s most important deep water port that is connected to big industrial \n\ncomplexes by fragile infrastructure such as pipelines and conveyor belts. In summer the city is a popular \n\ntourist destination. \n\nThe final results are presented in integrated hazard maps for all the considered and the aggregate \n\nscenario. Each integrated hazard map consists of MWH, MFD, MRU and MDB of the corresponding \n\nscenario. The analysis of tide effect consists of three different tidal stages mean lower low water \n\n(MLLW), mean sea level (MSL), and mean higher high water (MHHW). Further the contribution of \n\neach scenario to the aggregate tsunami impact is presented at MSL condition.  \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     4 \n\n1.1. Wave and Tsunami physics \n\nIn this master thesis the focus has been laid on studying the hazard of earthquake generated tsunamis. \n\nMost tsunamis are triggered by submarine earthquakes. But not all submarine earthquakes cause \n\ntsunamis just those that cause predominantly large vertical deformation of the seafloor (Synolakis, \n\n2003). These earthquakes are usually stronger than magnitude 7.0 and occur typically in between 0 and \n\n40 km depth (Bryant, 2014). The theoretical introduction to the linear theory that yields the most \n\nimportant properties for surface gravity waves is based on Sorensen (2006). \n\nA surface gravity wave is when a resting water surface is disturbed in vertical direction and gravity acts \n\nto return the displaced water mass back to equilibrium. Because of inertia the returning mass of water \n\npasses the equilibrium position and causes an oscillating movement of the surface. This movement \n\naffects the adjacent water surface, thus wave propagation is initiated. This mechanism moves energy \n\nfrom one location to another at water surface with almost no net displacement of the fluid itself \n\n(Sorensen, 2006).  \n\nWind induced gravity waves just affect the sea surface and water particles rotation and transported \n\nenergy decreases in depth. They have typical periods between 1 to 25 seconds which corresponds to tens \n\nup to a few hundreds of metres wave length (Bryant, 2014).  \n\nTsunami are also gravity waves as huge mass of water is displaced vertically. Because of that their \n\nperiods are commonly between 100 and 2000 seconds. Typical wavelengths of tsunamis are from 10 to \n\n500 km (Bryant 2014). The existence of a tsunami can be divided in three stages.  \n\n1.) Generation: Tsunamis are triggered by an immediate displacement of the entire water column, \n\ncaused by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides or rare impacts of cosmic objects.  \n\n2.) Propagation in the deep Ocean: Starts when gravity is acting to restore equilibrium in the dislocated \n\nwater column.  \n\n3.) Near shore propagation and inundation: Because of shallower bathymetry the approaching tsunami \n\nis strongly deformed and shoaling forces the wave to pile up. As periods are long and water masses \n\ncannot escape back to the ocean, water pushes landwards and causes inundation.  \n\nTsunamis behave the most time as shallow water waves and their particles move on elliptic tracks in the \n\nentire water column, so transferred energy is not decreasing in depth.   \n\nGenerally Ocean waves on the surface depend on three physical factors. (1) Gravitation acting to re-\n\nestablish the equilibrium of the free surface, (2) Surface tension, as pressure varies underneath a wave \n\nand (3) Viscosity that handles dissipation of energy.  \n\nApart from the linear wave theory, first introduced by Airy in 1845 several important properties of \n\nsurface gravity waves can be derived. The linear wave theory represented in this study is based on \n\nfollowing assumptions: \n\n? Water is considered as a homogeneous, incompressible fluid and, as the studied wavelength is \nlong enough (greater than approx. 3cm) that surface tension can be neglected. \n\n? The flow is irrotational ? \u00d7 ??? = 0 , so there is no shear stress at the surface at the air-sea \nboundary and water slips without friction over a solid bottom. The bottom is impermeable and \n\nhorizontal, thus water depth ? is considered constant. Thus there is no loss energy due to sloping \nbottom. The linear wave theory uses a velocity potential ? to describe the motion on the fluid \nsurface, ??? = ???. Accepting the irrotational movement, ?(? \u00d7 ??) = 0, the flow is non-\ndivergent and the velocity potential ? must satisfy Laplace\u2019s equation. \n\n?2? =\n?\u00b2?\n\n??\u00b2\n+\n\n?\u00b2?\n\n??\u00b2\n= 0 (1.1) \n\n where ? represents the horizontal and ? the vertical coordinate. \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     5 \n\n? The pressure on the surface is assumed to be constant, thus atmospheric pressure gradient is \nzero, and pressure difference between wave crest and trough is negligible.  \n\nThese approximations are valid if the wave height is small compared to the wave length and water depth. \n\nThus water particle velocities (proportional to the wave height) are small compared to the phase velocity \n\n(related to the wave length and water depth).  \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 Schematic sketch of the simplified conditions of waves propagating in x-direction; modified \nfrom Sorensen (2006). \n\nFigure 1.2 shows a wave traveling in x-direction with the phase velocity ? upon the stated assumptions \nin a ?, ? coordinate system. The ?-axis corresponds to the still water level. Water depth is ? and at the \nsolid bottom ? = ??. The wave height is ? defined as the difference between wave crest and wave \n\ntrough and the amplitude ? is ? =\n?\n\n2\n. The water surface is given by ? = ? where ? is a function of ? and \n\ntime ?, ?(?, ?). The wave length ? is given by the distance between two consecutive wave crests. The \nwave travels the distance ? in the period ?, thus the phase velocity is given by  \n\n? =\n?\n\n?\n (1.2) \n\nThe arrows along the water surface indicate particles movement when a wave crest or trough is passing \n\nindicating a clockwise movement. When a wave is travelling under deep water conditions the particles \n\nmovement is nearly circular and diminishes in depth. In shallow water conditions the particles tracks \n\nare elliptical and reach the bottom. The horizontal and vertical components of the particles movement \n\nare ? and ? respectively and the position is given by ? and ? coordinates at any instant. ? and ? are \nreferenced to the centre of the particles track. \n\nImportant dimensionless parameters are: \n\n? =\n2?\n\n?\n,  (1.3) \n\nwhere ? is the wave number and \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     6 \n\n? =\n2?\n\n?\n, (1.4) \n\nwhere ? is the angular frequency. \n\nThe linear theory was developed by solving Laplace\u2019s equation given in (1.1), applying certain boundary \n\nconditions. At the ocean bottom the kinematic boundary condition as there is no vertical flow across the \n\nboundary, is \n\n? =\n??\n\n??\n=\n\n??\n\n??\n= 0, at ? = ?? (1.5) \n\nWhere ? describes the velocity of the vertical flow, ? is the vertical coordinate for water particle at any \ninstant and ? is the velocity potential. And the kinematic boundary condition at the surface establishes \nthe relation between the vertical movement of the particle at the surface, to the surface position. \n\n? =\n??\n\n??\n=\n\n??\n\n??\n+ ?\n\n??\n\n??\n, at ? = ? (1.6) \n\nThe Bernoulli equation for an unsteady irrotational flow is: \n\n?\n\n?\n+ ?? +\n\n??\n\n??\n+\n\n1\n\n2\n(? + ?)2 =  0  (1.7) \n\nwhere ? is the pressure, ? is the fluid density and ? the acceleration of gravity (? ? 9.81???2). \nAt the surface pressure becomes zero and the dynamic boundary condition is given by \n\n?? +\n??\n\n??\n+\n\n1\n\n2\n(? + ?)2 =  0, at ? = ?  (1.8) \n\nThe kinematic and dynamic boundary condition are linearized using the still water surface yielding \n\n? =\n??\n\n??\n, at ? = 0 (1.9) \n\nand \n\n?? +\n??\n\n??\n= 0, at ? = 0  (1.10) \n\nTo find the velocity potential that satisfies the Laplace\u2019s equation (1.1) at the established boundary \n\nconditions (1.9) and (1.10), the method of separation of variables assuming a trial solution the form \n\n?(?, ?, ?) = ?(?)?(?)?(?) is used as shown in Pedlosky (2003). The solution for the velocity potential \n? yields to a sinusoidal time dependent function. \n\n? =\n??\n\n?\n \ncosh ?(? + ?)\n\ncosh ??\nsin(?? ? ??)

(1.15) \n\nFor waves propagating in deep water conditions, where \n?\n\n?\n?\n\n1\n\n25\n (Intergovernmental Oceanographic \n\nCommission, 2013) the term tanh ?? in equation (1.15) tends towards 1, (tanh ?? ? 1). Thus, in pure \ndeep water conditions the phase velocity ? for gravity waves yields \n\n? = ?\n?\n\n?\n (1.16) \n\nIn all physical problems regarding waves, dynamics involve a relationship between the wave number ? \nand the angular frequency ?. This relationship can be expressed as  \n\n? = ?(?) (1.17) \n\nThis relationship is called dispersion relationship and is given in equation (1.14) for the linear wave \n\ntheory. In case the angular frequency ? is a linear function of the wave number ?, the phase velocity ? \nis not depending on ?. This waves are non-dispersive.  \n\nMost of the waves in oceans are dispersive and phase velocity ? changes in respect with the angular \nfrequency ?. That leads to deformation of the group of waves and individual phase amplitudes disappear \nwhen passing the group while propagation. The group velocity is thus expressed as variation of angular \n\nfrequency ? in terms of wavenumber ?. \n\n?? =\n??\n\n??\n (1.18) \n\nDifferentiating and rearranging the group velocity ?? of gravity waves is given by  \n\n?? = ? [ \n1\n\n2\n (1 +\n\n2??\n\nsinh(2??)\n)] (1.19) \n\nFor waves under deep water conditions wave number ? is big, s\u00f3 sinh 2?? tends towards 0, \n(sinh 2?? ? 0).

This leads to the deformation of the wave group. \n\nShort waves approaching the shore line, enter gradually in shallower areas in a transition zone where \n\nthey start to feel the ocean bottom. Within this transition zone the phase velocity ? can be estimated with \nequation (1.15) which if k is expressed in terms of wave length ? turns into \n\n? =\n??\n\n2?\n= ?\n\n??\n\n2?\n[tanh (\n\n2??\n\n?\n)] (1.21) \n\nAnd the group velocity ?? of water waves can be estimated by applying equation (1.19). Figure 1.3 \n\ndepicts the transition zone where general approximations are not valid and full formulae from equations \n\n(1.15), (1.19) or (1.21) must be applied to obtain the correct velocities. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3 Illustration of wave condition depending on wave length and water depth (Bowden, 1983). \n\nTsunamis have great wave lengths and the relationship between the wave length ? and water depth ? \ndefines how gravity waves are classified. Most of the tsunamis travel under shallow water conditions. \n\nThis is true if wave length ? is much larger than water depth ?, \n?\n\n?\n?\n\n1\n\n25\n (Intergovernmental \n\nOceanographic Commission, 2013). In shallow conditions hyperbolic tangent function of ?? tends \ntowards ??, (tanh ?? = ??), thus the waves phase velocity ? is \n\n? = ??? (1.22) \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     9 \n\nThe group velocity ?? of waves in shallow water conditions can be obtained from equation (1.19). Wave \n\nnumber ? is low and sinh 2?? tends towards 2??. Thus, group velocity ?? yields \n\n?? = ? = ??? (1.23) \n\nAs group velocity and phase velocity are equal long waves in shallow water are considered as non-\n\ndispersive and their velocity depends only on the ocean depth. The phase velocity ? and the group \nvelocity ?? are equal for waves travelling in pure shallow water conditions. If the triggered gravity wave \n\nis long enough they travel as long waves in shallow water conditions. A wave travels purely under \n\nshallow water conditions if ? ?\n?\n\n25\n (Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, 2013). In this case \n\nEquation (1.23) is valid and tsunamis travel dispersion less at speeds depending only on the oceans \n\ndepth, if depth is constant. Considering an Ocean with 4000m depth the phase and group speed is \n\napproximately 700 km/h. When approaching shore areas ocean depth decreases and the waves slows \n\ndown at a rate proportional to the square root of the ocean depth ? (c.f. Equation (1.24). Due only little \nloss of energy whilst spreading throughout the oceans the waves pile up upon shoaling packing the entire \n\nenergy into an even shallower water layer. The wave amplitude ? increases at an inverse rate following \nthe empirical Greens Law and can be applied on gradually sloping beaches in linear shallow water \n\nconditions (Helene &amp; Yamashita, 2006).  \n\n? ?\n1\n\n?\n1\n\n4?\n (1.24) \n\nwhere ? is the wave amplitude and ? is the ocean depth. Hence a 1m high wave when considering \n2000m depth can get greater than 5m before landfall and still travel at speed of 35 km/h. Further due to \n\ntheir depth dependence the morphology of the bathymetry in shore areas can focus or defocus their \n\ntransported energies. This fact may lead to different impact magnitudes within only few kilometres \n\ndistance along the shoreline. \n\nHowever, the linear wave theory serves to understand basically physical processes throughout a tsunami \n\nevent and gives rapid and realistic wave height estimations near coastlines. Reality is more complex as \n\nthe non-linear terms should be taken into account. \n\nAs already stated most tsunamis can be considered as long waves travelling in shallow water, the shallow \n\nwater equations (SWEs) are commonly used to solve tsunami propagation problems. The initial sea \n\nsurface deformation initiates wave propagation as the dislocated mass of water is regaining equilibrium \n\ndue to gravity. The SWEs are obtained applying certain approximations to equations of the conservation \n\nof mass and conservation of momentum. The depth integrated form of the SWEs considers mean vertical \n\nvelocities and acceleration. The linear form can be used as a first approximation considering propagation \n\nin deep ocean as the waves travel with a much smaller amplitude than ocean depth. However, when \n\nentering shallower water non-linear convective inertia forces and bottom friction become increasingly \n\nimportant and the non-linear SWEs must be applied. For transoceanic tsunamis the SWEs in spherical \n\ncoordinates including the Coriolis Effect due to earth rotation should be considered. A more detailed \n\nview on the SWEs is presented in the methodology part in paragraph 2 about tsunami propagation. \n\n1.2. Geoscientific context  \n\nIn the morning of 1st November 1755 the big Lisbon earthquake followed by a tsunami destroyed the \n\nPortuguese capital and vast parts of the Portuguese, Spanish and Moroccan coastline. The shaking was \n\nfelt all over Europe as far as Hamburg, the Azores and Cape Verde Islands, the strongest ones all over \n\nthe Iberian Peninsula (Pereira de Sousa, 1919; Solares et al., 1979). The heaviest seismic shocks were \n\nfelt from Cape St. Vincent (Pereira de Sousa, 1919). More than 500 aftershocks were reported lasting \n\nfor more than nine months after the earthquake occurred (Mendes-Victor et al., 2008). As this was an \n\nhistoric event the magnitude could not be measured, but recent magnitude estimations are 8.5 \u00b1 0.3 \n\n(Solares &amp; Arroyo, 2004). The earthquake epicentre was located somewhere southwest of the \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     10 \n\nPortuguese coastline. The cataclysm was discussed intensely and theological theories were made. Kant \n\nand Voltaire explained the catastrophe as natural phenomena (Mendes-Victor et al., 2008 and Gupta &amp; \n\nGahalaut, 2013). The 1755 earthquake can be considered as the birth of modern seismology, as in 1760 \n\nJ. Mitchell considered the shakings to be elastic waves propagating in the earth\u2019s interior (Vallina, 1999). \n\nHowever, the quest of the exact earthquake location is still a matter of debate. The 1755 earthquake was \n\nnot the only tsunamigenic earthquake in the area. The historical reports date back to 60 BC (Mendo\u00e7a, \n\n1758) and geological evidences were found back to 218 BC by Luque et al. (2001). These authors found \n\nthree tsunamigenic deposits and suggests an average reoccurrence rate of 2000 years for two consecutive \n\nevents. His findings also underline that the 1755 event was not the first in this order of magnitude in the \n\narea.  \n\nIn the Portuguese Tsunami catalogue (Baptista &amp; Miranda, 2009) eight events are listed in the 20th \n\ncentury including small and local events. The strongest one was a magnitude 7.9 earthquake on 28th \n\nFebruary 1969 in the Horseshoe abyssal plain (Fukao, 1973). The tsunami that followed the earthquake \n\nhad the maximum amplitude recorded at the tide station of Casablanca with 0.6 m. The tsunami reached \n\nthe coast in Portugal, approximately thirty minutes (app. 3 a.m. UTC) after the earthquake in low tide \n\nconditions. The elevated seismicity and the great earthquake from 1755 raise several questions about \n\nthe epicentre and the mechanisms acting in the area.  \n\nThe epicenter location of the earthquakes 1755 and 1969 were somewhere southwest close to the Iberian \n\nPeninsula. This area is called Southwest Iberian Margin (SWIM), and it is known for its complex \n\ntectonics and heterogeneous morphology. It is composed of various seamounts like the Gorringe Bank, \n\nhigh ridges, low depressions, valleys and an accretionary wedge (see Fig. 1.4). The SWIM is located at \n\nthe eastern end of the Nubia-Eurasia plate boundary offshore Southwest Iberia and Northwest Morocco. \n\nIt is as an approximately 1000x400km stretch where the plate boundary is diffuse (Satori et al., 1994; \n\nTortella et al., 1997 and Hayward et al., 1999). The area is characterized by a widespread active \n\nseismicity (Cunha et al., 2012).  \n\nIn consideration of the 1755 earthquake location Johnston (1996) used scale comparison of isoseismal \n\nmaps of the 28th February 1969 event and suggested the Gorringe Bank, a seamount located about 200 \n\nkm southwest of Cape St. Vincent as possible candidate source. Baptista et al. (1998b) used \n\nhydrodynamic modelling and backward ray tracing to investigate on the source of the 1755 event \n\nsuggesting a source located closer to the continent. Further investigation revealed several tectonic \n\nstructures with tsunamigenic potential (Zitellini et al., 1999, Garc\u00eda et al., 2003, Terrinha et al., 2003, \n\nGutscher et al., 2002). Some authors suggest to consider multiple rupture scenarios (Zitellini et al., 1999, \n\n2001; Grac\u00eda et al., 2003; Ribeiro et al., 2006; Terrinha et al., 2003, 2009) and Matias et al. (2013) \n\nsuggest for multiple fault rupture events reoccurrence rates of 700 \u2013 3500 yr or less and states that the \n\nproximity of the faults should be taken into account. \n\nTo better understand the morphology and kinematics of the crust in the SWIM (Sartori et al., 1994, \nZitellini et al., 2001, Gutscher et al. 2003, Terrinha et al. 2003, Zitellini et al., 2009) various campaigns \nhave been undertaken using multi-channel reflection seismic, refraction seismic, multibeam swath \n\nBathymetry, and seismic tomography (e.g. ARRIFANO 1992, BIGSETS 1998, SISMAR 2001, \n\nSWIM 2009, NEAREST 2010). The analysis and interpretation of this data highlighted several tectonic \nstructures. In the SWIM several considerable NE-SW trending and southeast dipping thrust faults \n\n(Zitellini et al., 2009, Matias et al., 2013) could be identified, namely: Gorringe Bank fault, Marques de \n\nPombal fault, S\u00e3o Vincente fault, Horseshoe fault, Tagus Abyssal Plain fault, Coral Patch Ridge, Seine \n\nHills faults, (Hayward et al., 1999; Zitellini et al., 2001; Terrinha et al., 2003; Gr\u00e1cia et al., 2003; Zitellini \n\net al., 2004; Terrinha et al., 2009, Mart\u00ednez-Loriente et al., 2013) (see Fig. 1.4). Recently Mart\u00ednez-\n\nLoriente et al. (2014) propose the Horseshoe Abyssal plain thrust fault located close to the Horseshoe \n\nfault. These thrust faults are intersected by large WNW-ESE trending dextral strike-slip faults called \n\nSWIM faults separated in Lineaments North and South (Zitellini et al., 2009). Zitellini et al. (2009) \n\nstated the SWIM faults may be in transition from a diffuse to discrete transform plate boundary setting \n\nbut this theory was later refuted by Cunha et al. (2012). These faults nevertheless prove the recent dextral \n\nstrike-slip movement (Rosas et al., 2009). In the eastern most part of the Gulf of Cadiz Gutscher et al. \n\n(2002) believe to have identified an active subduction dipping eastwards underneath the Gibraltar Arc \n\nsupported by p-velocity anomalies. The absence of active arc volcanism and instrumental thrust \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     11 \n\nearthquakes but folding and faulting of young sediments at the Cadiz accretionary wedge and \n\nindependent movement of the Alboran block causes controversy scientific discussion (e.g. Matias et al., \n\n2013, Duarte et al., 2013).  The slab roll back causes extension in the Alboran Sea and is responsible for \n\nthe westward migration of the Gibraltar Arc. Duarte et al. (2013) states that the Alboran block moves \n\ndistinctly at velocities of 3-6 mm yr-1, higher than the Africa Eurasia convergence (4 mm yr-1) and \n\nadditionally induces compressive stresses to the SWIM. Duarte et al. (2013) suggest that both \n\nmechanism may lead to passive margin reactivation as the Gibraltar Arc propagates westwards although \n\nthe migration velocity has been proven to slow down (Gutscher et al., 2012).  \n\nHowever, oblique NW-SE to WNW-ESE striking occurs according to kinematic plate models based on \n\nGPS data at rates of 4.5-6 mm yr-1 (Sella et al., 2002; McClusky et al., 2003; Fernandes et al., 2003; \n\nNocquet &amp; Calais et al., 2004).  Rosas et al. (2012) used analogue and numerical modelling techniques \n\nobtaining coherent results and similar morphological features in the corner zone between the strike-slip \n\nSWIM faults and the Horseshoe fault. Other recent studies confirm the complexity of the SWIMs interior \n\nand state incipient and relic subduction and active thrust faults (Duarte et al., 2013, Monna et al., 2015). \n\nThe dynamic processes of the SWIM have been eagerly discussed in literature and two main acting \n\nmotors have been identified as NW-SE convergence between Africa and Eurasia and westward Gibraltar \n\nArc migration. The importance and future development of each of the contributors is not doubtlessly \n\nclarified stressing the need of further investigations. Successive research revealed stepwise more parts \n\nof the SWIM puzzle classifying the area as a major source of tsunamigenic earthquakes. Systematized \n\ntsunami hazard assessment is required to launch adequate mitigation measures. Especially the tectonic \n\nuncertainties confirm the need evacuation measures based on tsunami hazard assessments and an \n\noperational tsunami warning system. Further west of the SWIM the Nubia-Eurasia plate boundary is \n\ndefined as strike-slip fault linked to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at the Azores triple junction. The eastern \n\nsegment is called Gloria-Fault a 400km long fault with right lateral slip (Gonzales et al., 1996) and the \n\npart at Azores Islands is called the Terceira Ridge. The Terceira Ridge with high moderate seismicity is \n\nlinked to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at the Azores Triple Junction (see Fig. 1.3). Common mechanism in \n\nthe area are normal and transform faulting (Tortella et al. 1997). At the Gloria fault between 24\u00b0 W and \n\n19\u00b0 W several large strike-slip events took places in the 20th century (eg. Gutenberg and Richter, 1949; \n\nLynnes and Ruff, 1975 and Grimson and Chen, 1986). The events on 25th November 1941 and 26th May \n\n1975 triggered small tsunamis with maximum amplitudes about 0.45m which were registered in \n\nCasablanca (Baptista and Miranda, 2009).  \n\n \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     12 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.4 A: ATJ \u2013 Azores triple junction; AGFZ Azores-Gibraltar fracture zone B: Tectonic map of \nsouthwest Iberian Margin (SWIM).

(2013) \n\nConcluding, the Portuguese coast is prone to tsunami hazards by local (SWIM) and regional (Gloria \n\nfault) source areas. In both areas considerable earthquakes took place and some of them triggered \n\ntsunamis. The SWIM is not fully understood and composed of complex tectonic setting. This source \n\narea is of specific interest as it triggered the 1755 tsunami and due to the closeness to the Portuguese, \n\nSpanish and Moroccan coastlines. Both source areas must be considered when applying the DTHA in \n\nstudy areas located in Portugal, Spain or Morocco. \n\nThe earthquake scenarios used to simulate the tsunami impact scenarios in Sines are based on geological \n\nevidences. For this thesis the Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) and their typical fault (TF) \n\n(Miranda et al., 2008; Omira et al., 2009) has been used to produce the tsunami scenarios. This DTHA \n\napproach uses the SWIM and the Gloria as seismogenic source areas. Five TFs and their MCE scenarios \n\nhave been considered to calculate the tsunami scenarios namely: the Gloria Fault (GF), the Cadiz Wedge \n\nFault (CWF), the Gorringe Bank Fault (GBF), the Horseshoe Fault (HSF) and the Marques Pombal Fault \n\n(MPF). Additionally a composite rupture model of HSF and MPF (HSMPF) has been built as suggested \n\nby (Ribeiro et al., 2006).  \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     13 \n\n2. Methodology \n\nTsunami hazard assessment is done using two different methodologies: Deterministic Tsunami Hazard \n\nAssessment (DTHA) and Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment (PTHA). This master thesis applies \n\nthe DTHA approach.  \n\nThe DTHA method consists of considering certain tsunami events, commonly the most credible \n\nearthquake (MCE) scenarios. It provides a description as precise as possible of the effects of large \n\ntsunamis that may be triggered by known tectonic and geological processes.   \n\nA tsunami hazard scenario corresponds to an event generated by a single or in some cases from multiple \n\nsources of fixed dimensions and location, usually corresponding to characteristic earthquakes or to the \n\nMCE derived from geological constrains. The chosen scenarios are then modelled numerically and their \n\nimpact is studied in a specific study area. The methodology is used by a broad scientific community to \n\nestablish tsunami mitigation measures and for coastal engineering purposes. For that this approach is a \n\nvaluable tool for coastal disaster management. \n\n2.1. Preparation of the tsunami simulation \n\nFor the determination of the single scenarios for DTHA and computation of tsunami propagation and \n\nimpact for each scenario the benchmarked numerical code NSWING (Non-linear Shallow Water Model \n\nwith Nested Grids) (Miranda et al., 2014) has been employed.  \n\nTo model a tsunami numerically several information and data is necessary. The life of a tsunami may  \n\nbe divided in three stages, namely: Generation, Propagation and Inundation, and the same applies to \n\ntsunami numerical simulations. The analysis begins in identifying the tsunami source areas and \n\ngathering data of the typical faults (TFs) (c.f. paragraph 1.2). These parameters are then used to calculate \n\ninitial sea surface elevation that constitutes the initial condition to initiate the numerical model. The \n\nstudy area needs to be re-built as a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) describing the bathymetric and \n\ntopographic features. To better describe the coastal areas high resolution DEMs are needed close to the \n\ncoast. Depending on the spatial extent from the tsunami source to the study area it is necessary employ \n\na system of coupled nested grids to achieve an adequate resolution in the study area. In this paragraph \n\nthese stages are described to comprehensively explain the proceeding used in this thesis. \n\nThe following steps are carried to launch the NSWING model: (i) Computation of  the initial condition, \n\n(ii) Preparation of the DEM covering the oceanic path between the source area and the study area, (iii) \n\nImplementation the DEM in a system of nested grids, (iv) Chose the physical quantities to describe the \n\ntsunami impact in the study area: run up, flow depth, maximum inundation distance, and launch the \n\nsimulation. \n\n(i) Computation of the initial condition: First it is necessary to establish the earthquake scenario upon \ngiven fault parameters that will generate the tsunami. By knowing the tsunamigenic earthquake \n\nsource areas and its TFs (Miranda et al., 2008 and Omira et al. 2009) that may affect the study \n\narea. It is important to study all possible sources and to use the parameters from the most recent \n\npublished papers. The initial condition is then computed using the model presented by Okada \n\n(1985) embedded in Mirone suite (Luis, 2007). The known fault is drawn upon the parent grid. In \n\nthis thesis the half minute North Atlantic grid (GEBCO, 2014) has been interpolated to 640m \n\nresolution for the parent grid called Layer01. The parent grids extent are from -12.924\u00b0 W to -\n\n5.735\u00b0 W and from 33.982\u00b0 N to 39.230 N. This grid embraces all tsunamigenic source areas, the \n\nopen ocean and the study area. The output of the initial condition is also a finite grid file with the \n\nsame extensions as the parent grid. After computing the initial conditions for all (TFs) they are \n\nstored in a folder, from where the NSWING model is launched later. The theoretical background \n\nto model the initial condition is given qualitative manner in paragraph 2.2. \n\n(ii) Building the DEM: In a second step the DEM of the study area, the city and port of Sines has \nbeen built using GIS tools, namely ArcGIS and QGIS. A number of different data sets containing \n\nbathymetric and topographic information have been combined in order to obtain a maximum of \n\ndetail in the study area. The different data sets used are: a set of high resolution LIDAR data set \n\n(Dire\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral do Territ\u00f3rio, 2013), a bathymetric model (Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico de Portugal, \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     14 \n\n2012), and a nautical chart (Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico de Portugal, 2010). Additionally GPS-RTK \n\n(Global Positioning System \u2013 Real Time Kinetic) has been applied in areas with missing \n\ninformation. A final resolution of 10 m could be produced and represents the study area properly. \n\nMain geological features such as rocky outcrops could be identified in the resulting DEM. A short \n\ntheoretical introduction on building DEMs for tsunami modelling purposes is presented in \n\nparagraph 2.3. \n\n(iii) Preparations of the nested grids and implementation of the DEM: To guarantee smooth \npropagation in the model and numerical stability a system of coupled nested grids has been \n\napplied and Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition (CFL) must be satisfied. The CFL condition is \n\nexplained in paragraph 2.4. The resolution of the parent grid is 640m and the resolution of the \n\nDEM is 10m. In this step, 2 intermediate girds are produced to reduce the resolution to the scale \n\nof 10m in the DEM. A refinement factor of 4 has been applied to achieve the two grids called \n\nLayer21 and Layer31 with 160m and 40m respectively. To get smooth propagation of the tsunami \n\nwhen passing from one Layer to the next, the corresponding geographically smaller layers haven \n\nbeen nested using the TINTOL tool embedded in Mirone suite (Luis, 2007). This tool allows to \n\nobtain the correct nesting information (correct corner nodes and coordinates) upon the applied \n\nrefinement factor. This information is than used to produce the higher resolute layer apart from \n\nthe coarser layer. In the last step the DEM is implemented in Layer31 and nesting information for \n\nthe Layer41 is produced. This information is than applied on the DEM to get the correct corner \n\nnodes and the resulting Layer41. Layer01 to Layer41 are stored together with the initial condition \n\nin the folder together with the initial condition. The prepared layers for the nested grids are shown \n\nin figure 2.1.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 Schematic outline of the 4 Layer prepared for NSWING; Layer 41 contains the DEM. \n\n(iv) Definition and launching the tsunami simulation: The NSWING operational files and the files \ndescribed from (i) to (iii) are sufficient if prepared correctly to launch a tsunami simulation. To \n\ndo this an executable batch file must be edited, so that NSWING can use the prior prepared files. \n\nAdditionally to the files to be used operators are extended to calculate the information wanted. In \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     15 \n\nthis study we additionally prepared a list in format DAT with geographical coordinates \n\ncorresponding to the positions of the virtual tide gauges. NSWING reads this file and stores the \n\nfree surface elevation in this point for a chosen time step. This way waveforms can be analysed \n\nand compared with existing records. The computation tsunami propagation and inundation are \n\ndescribed in paragraph 2.4 and 2.5 respectively. \n\nWith the DTHA approach physical quantities such as wave height, flow depth, drawback, inundation \n\nextent or velocities can be approximated. These quantities serve to draw scenario maps, develop \n\nvulnerability studies and evacuation measurements. Maximum current speed is also an important \n\nparameter that can be mapped if the vulnerability of buildings or coastal structures is in focus of the \n\nstudy. Tsunami travel time maps show the first arrivals of the waves in the study area. Virtual tide gauges \n\ncan be placed to analyse the waveforms arriving at the test site. Information such as polarity, period, \n\nmaximum wave height at the tide gauges and attenuation time can be obtained. As the tide regime in the \n\nAtlantic is strong, i. e. there is a significant difference (of the order of meters) between high tide and \n\nlow tide, the scenarios must include this effect. An aggregate scenario can be produced plotting the \n\nMWH and the MFD in each cell considering the contribution of the individual scenarios (Tinti et al., \n\n2011).  \n\nThe final results are presented in integrated hazard maps for all the considered and the aggregate \n\nscenario. The integrated hazard maps have been produced using GIS tools. Each integrated hazard map \n\nconsists of MWH, MFD, MRU and MDB of the corresponding scenario. The static effect of tides is \n\nanalysed for three different tidal stages mean lower low water (MLLW), mean sea level (MSL), and \n\nmean higher high water (MHHW). Further the contribution of each scenario to the aggregate tsunami \n\nimpact at MSL condition has been calculated. The analysis of the waveforms produced at chosen virtual \n\ntide gauges provide information such as, arrival time, period, the biggest wave and attenuation time.  \n\n2.2. Generation of tsunamis in the source area \n\nTsunami are triggered by submarine earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions or meteorite impacts. \n\nAs stated earlier this thesis focuses on studying the tsunami hazard caused by earthquakes. They occur \n\nat or near to tectonic faults for example along plate boundaries. Three types of faults can be \n\ndistinguished: strike-slip or transform faults, normal faults and thrust or invers faults. The movement \n\nalong pure strike-slip faults is horizontally and usually do not cause tsunamis. In some cases rupture \n\nmechanism along these faults may also have a vertical component and have the potential to trigger a \n\ntsunami. Normal and inverse faults cause vertical seabed motion and they are capable to lift or lower \n\nthe water column above triggering the motion at the sea surface. Inverse faults may have contributions \n\nof horizontal components. \n\nThe initial sea surface deformation is computed using the analytical formulae, after Mansinha &amp; Smylie \n\n(1971) synthetized in Okada (1985). They represent the displacement field on the surface of an elastic \n\nhalf-space, when a dislocation of given direction and size is introduced at a given epicentral depth. The \n\ndeformation is then transferred to the free surface assuming that the water layer above is considered as \n\nincompressible layer and the seabed deformation is transferred directly to the free surface of the ocean \n\n(Kajiura, 1970). \n\nTo compute the seabed deformation one needs information on the earthquake mechanism: fault plane \n\nparameters, magnitude and distribution of deformation along the fault plane.  \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     16 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 Definition of an individual seismogenic source. (Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e \nVulcanologia, 2015) \n\nThe fault plane parameters are the length, L, the width, W, the slip \u2013 dislocation along the fault plane \n\nand the angles, strike, dip, rake &amp; depth. Length and Width give the extensions of the fault plane. Strike, \n\ndip and rake are given in angular units. The strike is the angle relative to the north on a horizontal plane \n\nand describes the trending of the fault. The dip measures the inclination from the planar horizontal \n\nsurface. And the rake gives the direction of the movement along the fault plane during a rupture in \n\nrelation to the strike. The distances of the movement along the rake is given by the slip and is measured \n\nin meters. In figure 2.2 the described fault parameters are represented. Upon these variables the initial \n\ntsunami condition is calculated employing Okadas (1985) model and set to the sea surface to initiate \n\npropagation.  \n\nThese model has some limitations as the rupture area is simplified to a rectangle and the rupture process \n\nis considered to instantaneous. Dutykh (2008) and Dutykh &amp; Dias (2007) showed that this model is not \n\nappropriate tsunami earthquakes with slower rupture mechanism. However, in this study the application \n\nof the model is justified as it has been used for medium sized thrust faults and an instantaneous rupture \n\ncan be assumed (Omira, 2010).  \n\nThe seismic moment (Aki, 1972) is related to shear modulus ?, the rupture area ? and the slip ? \n\n?0 = ??? (2.1) \n\nWhere ? is the shear modulus in (Pa), ? is the rupture area (m\u00b2) and ? is the mean net displacement on \n? in (m).  \n\nHowever, important to state is that the seismic moment depends on the three factors. But only two of \n\nthem may have direct influence on tsunami generation. The slip is the movement that describes the \n\ndislocation along the fault plane. Greater slip values produce greater amplitudes. And greater areas of \n\nthe fault plane produce higher periods. The shear modulus ?, thus is a property of the crust in the region \nand has no impact on the tsunami but on the resulting seismic moment ?0 and the moment magnitude, \n??.  \n\nThe moment magnitude serves to quantify the earthquakes strength. It was derived by Kanamori (1977) \n\nand is linked with the scalar seismic moment, ?0. This scale has the big advantage that it does not \nsaturate as other magnitude scales, for earthquakes stronger than magnitude 8.  \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     17 \n\n?? =\n2\n\n3\nlog10(?0) ? 10.73 (2.2) \n\nTable 3.1 in paragraph 3 summarizes all used fault parameters to calculate the initial conditions for the \n\nin paragraph 1.2 presented tsunami scenarios. The initial conditions for all considered tsunami scenarios \n\nhave been computed in Mirone suite (Luis, 2007) that employs Okadas (1985) model. \n\n2.3. Digital Elevation Model \n\nIn order to represent in sufficient quality the study area digital data of bathymetric and topographic \n\nfeatures and/or charts are combined. The DEM is built in a Geographic Information System and the final \n\noutput is a simple grid dataset where each cell has a single numerical elevation value. The resolution of \n\nthe resulting DEM defines quality of the entire numerical tsunami model Tinti et al. (2011). \n\nTsunami propagation close to the coast and on land is critically dependent on the small scale effects; so, \n\nthe DEM (digital elevation model) must be able to represent the most significant coastal features and \n\nthe shoreline accurately. The DEM, representing the bare earth, was produced including: (i) the tsunami \n\nsource area and the test site areas along the coast (ii) good horizontal resolution in the test areas in order \n\nto assure a full description of local effects (iii) continuity offshore-onshore in particular in respect to the \n\nvertical datum.  \n\nThe information used to build the DEM may be vector or raster/grid data containing height or depth \n\ninformation. Vectorised datasets can be point, line or polygon information corresponding to different \n\naltitudes such as bathymetric or topographic contours of various charts or individual point measurements \n\nlike individual gathered GPS data. On the other hand raster data contains equal sized squares as cells, \n\nwhere each cell represents its corresponding height information. Each dataset is given in a horizontal \n\nand vertical spatial reference system which is usually depending on the geographical location, spatial \n\nextent, and producing institution or end-user. For instance bathymetric charts for nautical purposes are \n\ncommonly referenced to bathymetric zero and topographic data is usually set in relation to MSL. One \n\nmust be aware to while DEM preparation to set all used data sets in the same reference system. These \n\ndatasets are available in different qualities. A raster dataset with smaller cell size contains more detailed \n\ninformation as a dataset with bigger cell size. When combining two or more different datasets it is \n\nnecessary to give preference to more accurate data to avoid ambiguities. The vectorised datasets may \n\nimprove the final DEM especially if the available raster data is of poor quality. It is crucial to transform \n\nall used data in the same horizontal and spatial reference system. In a final step the resulting DEM should \n\nbe evaluated and verified for instance by posterior GPS-measurements at specific control points. A 3-D \n\nrepresentation also helps to avoid errors for example at dataset boundaries. The resulting DEM is \n\npresented in Fig. 2.3.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 Resulting digital elevation model (DEM) of Sines test-site. \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     18 \n\n2.4. Tsunami Propagation &amp; SWEs \n\nThe motion of any viscous fluid substances and gas is described by the Navier-Stokes Equations, which \n\nare based on the Newton\u2019s second law conservation of momentum in three dimensions. In combination \n\nwith the conservation of mass a system of four coupled nonlinear partial differential equations are \n\nformed for three velocity components and pressure. There is no complete analytical solution for these \n\ncoupled system of equations. Approximations are introduced to obtain best possible solutions depending \n\non the scale of the geophysical process to be studied. This thesis applies the shallow water model which \n\nneglects viscous forces and the depth integrated SWEs average vertical velocities and accelerations. \n\nOther models to simulate tsunamis are the Boussinesq long wave model and the complete fluid dynamic \n\nmodel. The SWEs remain the most used model used by computational codes. In the last two decades \n\nnumerical codes like TUNAMI-N2 (Imamura 1995), MOST (Titov and Synolakis 1995; 1998), \n\nCOMCOT (Liu et al., 1998) and more recently UNIBO-TSUFD (Tonini et al., 2011 &amp; Tinti et al., 2013) \n\nhave been developed to model with sufficient accuracy tsunami propagation and coastal impact. To start \n\npropagation all these codes apply the model presented by (Okada 1985) described in paragraph 2.2. \n\nHowever, all these models are based on the SWEs but use different numerical methods to solve them. \n\nThis study uses the recently developed and benchmarked code NSWING (Non-linear Shallow Water \n\nModel with Nested Grids) (Miranda et al., 2014). NSWING has been benchmarked following the \n\ndefinitions presented by Synolakis (2006). It is entirely written in C and applies core parallelisation \n\nenhancing computational performance.  \n\nThe equations that govern the motion of tsunamis are called Navier-Stokes Equations. They represent \n\nNewton\u2019s conservation of momentum in three dimensions in a cartesian frame (?,?,?) (2.3a, 2.3b and \n2.3c). These three equations in combination with the equation of conservation of mass (2.3d) build a \n\nsystem of four coupled non-linear partial differential equations. \n\n?: ? (\n??\n\n??\n+ ??? ? ??) = ?\n\n??\n\n??\n+\n\n?? ??\n\n??\n+\n\n?? ??\n\n??\n+\n\n?? ??\n\n??\n (2.3a) \n\n?: ?

The considered approximations are applied to the Navier-Stokes equations to \n\nreduce them to the SWEs. To obtain the SWEs viscous stresses and any flow gradients in vertical \n\ndirection are eliminated (Synolakis, 2006) which is considered as a valid approximation for long waves \n\nif ? ?\n?\n\n25\n (Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, 2013) is satisfied. The water body is assumed \n\nto be incompressible. The SWEs are derived by a depth average integration from the ocean bottom to \n\nthe free surface and it is assumed that pressure distribution is hydrostatic everywhere. This allows to \n\nintroduce the variable ? the free surface elevation through the hydrostatic approximation for the \npressure, ? = ??(? + ?), where ? is the water depth. This assumption is valid and considered to deliver \nresults with sufficient accuracy as tsunamis are considered as long waves propagating in shallow water \n\nas stated in the paragraph 1.2. The shallow water model calculates the evolution of the water surface \n\nand the depth averaged water particle velocity. \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     19 \n\nThe SWEs may be used in their linear or non-linear form. The linear SWEs consists in neglecting the \n\nnon-linear terms: non-linear convective inertia forces and the bottom friction terms.

Linsley and Franzini \n\n(1979) for instance presented different values for the Manning\u2019s roughness coefficient for varying \n\nconditions in a channel. When considering the worst case tsunami scenario Manning\u2019s roughness \n\ncoefficient is set to zero (Omira 2010). \n\nFor the numerical solution the presented SWEs need to be discretised. The discretization process \n\nimplements replacing the derivatives in the SWEs by finite difference approximations. To do this the \n\nnumerical code models the problem in a grid with finite cells (c.f. paragraph (iii) in 2.1). The differential \n\nequations are discretised in the grid model scheme to formulate an algebraic system of equations. This \n\nsystem of equations follows a specific scheme to compute the solutions for the SWEs in each cell of the \n\ngrid model at specific time steps. For each cell (i,j) in each instant of time the discretised set of algebraic \n\nequations are solved upon the conditions of the prior time step. The initial condition launches the \n\npropagation at time step, ? = 0. NSWING adopts an explicit staggered finite leapfrog numerical scheme \nfor linear terms (Liu et al. 1998) and an upwind scheme for non-linear terms. The choice of the time \n\nstep must satisfy the CFL (Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy) condition to ensure numerical stability. The linear \n\nCFL condition is shown in equation (2.8) and NSWING uses 0.5 as ???? value.  \n\n? = ? ?\n??\n\n??\n? ???? (2.8) \n\n2.5. Tsunami inundation &amp; Run up \n\nTo model the inundation on dry land a moving boundary scheme is used. The overland inundation is a \n\ncomplicated task as at includes interaction with the impacting wave with the shore line. In order to obtain \n\nreliable results for nearshore propagation and on land inundation a high resolution DEM is crucial. To \n\ncalculate inundation a specific numerical algorithm is employed to propagate the incident wave on dry \n\nland. This algorithm must be updated each time step and for each grid cell to simulate the moving \n\nshoreline appropriately. This moving boundary algorithm compares if the total water depth is high \n\nenough to inundate neighbouring dry grid cells, along each of the two directions. In case of neighbouring \n\ngrid cell inundation the algorithm must be update with the new shoreline for the next time step.  \n\nThe study area is modelled in the DEM as finite gird containing dry cells \u201cland\u201d and wet cells \u201cwater\u201d \n\nwhich are separated by the shoreline. A simplified one dimensional stepwise model is presented in figure \n\n2.4 to visualize the inundation proceeding.  \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     21 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4 Illustration of the inundation algorithm in one dimension as presented in Liu et al.

Sines holds one of the most important \n\ndeep-water ports which contains oil-bearing, petrochemical, liquid bulk, coal and container terminals. \n\nThe port and its industrial infrastructures are facing the ocean southwest towards the main seismogenic \n\nsources. This work considers two different seismic zones: the Southwest Iberian Margin and the Gloria \n\nFault. Within these two regions, we selected a total of six scenarios to assess the tsunami impact at the \n\ntest site. The tsunami simulations are computed using NSWING a Non-linear Shallow Water Model \n\nWith Nested Grids. In this study, the static effect of tides is analysed for three different tidal stages \n\nMLLW (mean lower low water), MSL (mean sea level) and MHHW (mean higher high water). For each \n\nscenario, inundation is described by maximum values of wave height, flow depth, drawdown, run-up \n\nand inundation distance. Synthetic waveforms are computed at virtual tide gauges at specific locations \n\noutside and inside the harbour. The final results describe the impact at Sines test site considering the \n\nsingle scenarios at mean sea level, the aggregate scenario and the influence of the tide on the aggregate \n\nscenario. The results confirm the composite of Horseshoe and Marques Pombal fault as the worst case \n\nscenario. It governs the aggregate scenario with about 60% and inundates an area of 3.5km\u00b2. \n\nKeywords: Tsunami hazard assessment, numerical modelling, aggregate scenarios \n\n \n\n1 Introduction \n\nTsunamis are low frequency but high impact hazards for coastal societies. The December 26th, 2004 \n\nIndian Ocean and the March 11th, 2011 Tohoku striking tsunami events raised awareness due to the \n\nenormous loss of life and property. The Indian Ocean event in 2004 demonstrated the need for \n\noperational early warning systems around the world. However, seven years later, the 2011 Tohoku event \n\nshowed the limitations of the scientific knowledge concerning tsunami sources, coastal impacts, and \n\nmitigation measures. Since then, in the NEAM region (North East Atlantic, Mediterranean and \n\nconnected seas) many efforts have been addressed to understand better the tsunamigenic sources and to \n\nimprove the tsunami hazard assessment capabilities. Within the NEAM region, the Gulf of Cadiz is \n\namong the most tsunami hazardous areas. The historical reports include events dated back to 60 BC \n\nhttp://www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci-discuss.net/3/4663/2015/nhessd-3-4663-2015.pdf\nhttp://www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci-discuss.net/3/4663/2015/nhessd-3-4663-2015.pdf\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     23 \n\n(Mendon\u00e7a, 1758, Baptista and Miranda, 2009; Kaabouben et al., 2009), but the  geological evidence \n\nshow high energy events back to 7000 years BP (Luque et al., 2001). \n\nThe Portuguese coast is highly exposed to tsunami threat from local and regional active tectonic sources.  \n\nThe main tsunamigenic area is the SWIM (South West Iberia Margin), with a number of considerable \n\nSE dipping inverse faults (Zitellini et al., 2009, Matias et al., 2013). The most severe tsunami was the \n\n1st November, 1755 caused by the Lisbon earthquake with an estimated magnitude of 8.5 by Martins \n\nand Mendes Victor (1990). This magnitude was more recently re-evaluated by Solares and Arroyo \n\n(2004) with an estimate of 8.5\u00b10.3. The tsunami hit the entire northern Atlantic basin with huge impact \n\nin Iberia and Morocco (Baptista and Miranda, 2009). In the 20th century, the 28th February 1969 \n\nearthquake with a magnitude of 7.9 (Fukao, 1973) caused a small tsunami of 0.5 m amplitude in Lagos \n\nand Cascais (Baptista et al., 1992; Baptista and Miranda, 2009). The tsunami waves hit the coast circa \n\n3 a.m. in low tide conditions (Baptista et al., 1992) but no significant damage was observed.  \n\nThe second tsunamigenic zone to be considered is the Gloria Fault. The Gloria fault is a segment of the \n\nEurasia-Nubia plate boundary. It is a large strike slip fault, located between 24\u00baW and 19\u00baW, with scarce \n\nseismic activity but was nonetheless the location of several large events during the 20th Century, in \n\nparticular the 25th November 1941 earthquake, a submarine strike-slip event of magnitude 8.3-8.4 \n\n(Gutenberg and Richter, 1949) and the 26th May 1975 with magnitude 7.9 (Lynnes and Ruff, 1975; \n\nGrimson and Chen, 1986).  \n\nIn recent years, a considerable number of tsunami hazard assessment studies were published for the \n\nNorth East Atlantic area. Most of these studies focus on the tsunami impact in the Gulf of Cadiz using \n\na scenario based approach namely: Lima et al. (2010), Omira et al. (2010), Omira et al. (2011), Atillah \n\net al. (2011), Baptista et al. (2011a), Renou et al. (2011), Omira et al. (2013), Benchekroun et al. (2013) \n\nand Lemos et al. (2014). Recently, Omira et al. (2014) published a probabilistic tsunami hazard \n\nassessment for the North East Atlantic.  \n\nIn this study, we use a Deterministic Tsunami Hazard Assessment (DTHA) approach to evaluate the \n\ntsunami impact in Sines. The study area contains the country\u2019s most important deep water port which is \n\nconnected to big industrial complexes by fragile infrastructure such as pipelines and conveyor belts. In \n\nsummer the city is a popular tourist destination. \n\nThe DTHA approach consists of studying the impact of specific tsunami events \u2013 tsunami scenarios - in \n\nthe study area. The impact is described in terms of maximum wave height (MWH), maximum flow \n\ndepth (MFD), maximum run up (MRU) and maximum drawback (MDB). We further built the aggregate \n\nscenario plotting the MWH in each cell considering the contribution of the individual scenarios (Tinti \n\net al., 2011). \n\nThe final results are presented in integrated hazard maps for all the considered and the aggregate \n\nscenario. Each integrated hazard map consists of MWH, MFD, MRU and MDB of the corresponding \n\nscenario. The static effect of tides is analysed for three different tidal stages mean lower low water \n\n(MLLW), mean sea level (MSL), and mean higher high water (MHHW). Further we present the \n\ncontribution of each scenario to the aggregate tsunami impact at MSL condition.  \n\n \n\n2 Study area and Digital elevation model \n\nSines is a city located on the west littoral margin of the Iberian Peninsula about 150km south of Lisbon \n\n(Fig. 3.1 a). The study area includes the city of Sines and parts of the surrounding municipality covering \n\na coastline of about 35 km. The city has approximately 15000 inhabitants (Instituto Nacional de \n\nEstat\u00edstica, 2011) and about 5000 floating population because of economic and touristic purpose.  \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     24 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 (a) General map: Location of Sines test site; (b) test site map identifying general features \nand tide gauges for synthetic wave forms. \n\nSines plays a major role in terms of energy production and storage. There are 2 great production centres \n\nof oil and gas industry (GALP refinery and Repsol YPF petrochemical industrial complex) which are \n\nconnected via pipelines to oil-bearing and petrochemical terminal of Sines harbour (C\u00e2mara Municipal \n\nde Sines, 2007). The harbour is the country\u2019s most important deep water port (with 28 m depth) situated \n\nsouth of the city centre and consists of 5 terminals: liquid bulks, liquid natural gas, petrochemical, \n\ncontainer and multipurpose; as well as fishing and leisure ports (Porto de Sines, 2014). The liquid natural \n\ngas terminal (LNG) contains facilities for loading and unloading processes of methane carriers, \n\nexpedition facilities at LNG terminal depot, three LNG storage tanks, LNG processing facilities and \n\nnatural gas dispatch facilities for the pipeline connecting the Sines LNG terminal to the Natural Gas \n\nTransport Network. At the multipurpose terminal coal is stored in stockpiles and is transported by a \n\nconveyor belt to Sines thermoelectric power plant. The power plant uses seawater for cooling of the \n\ngenerators which is captured and returned at the intake and restitution points close to S\u00e3o Torpes beach \n\n(Fig. 3.1 b). The majority of the harbour facilities and big areas of the power plant are situated in possible \n\ninundation area below the 25m topographic contour. The liquefied natural gas storage deposits is located \n\nright behind the port. In case of a destructive tsunami, facilities or leaking pipelines raise the danger of \n\nexplosion and may cause an environmental disaster.  \n\nThe study area limits are East to West from 8\u00b047\u201900\u201d to 8\u00b055\u201900\u201d and North to South from 37\u00b058\u201900\u201d \n\nto 37\u00b055\u201900\u201d. In the northern part the landscape is designed by the influence of the magmatic batholith \n\nof Sines with a steep and rocky seafront. On the south westernmost part of the rocky outcrops begins \n\nthe area of the port. The main jetty is facing south with a maximum elevation of 15m above MSL and a \n\nwidth of 10m (figure 3.1 b). The Liquid Bulks Terminal and Petrochemical Terminal are protected by \n\nthe jetty against strong swell reaching the Portuguese coast mainly from northwest. The smaller jetties \n\nprotect the fishing and leisure ports, which also protect the shell-shaped beach \u201cVasco da Gama\u201d (see \n\nfigure 3.1 b). Northwards is located the city centre and the majority of domestic property on the top of \n\nthe batholith with altitudes higher than 25m above sea level. Further east, the remaining terminals: \n\nmultipurpose, container and natural gas protected by a recently enhanced jetty of approximately 2.5km \n\nlength (see figure 3.1 b). The container terminal is currently under construction due to expansion at the \n\neasternmost area of the port exposing new economic value to tsunami threat. Further southeast at the \n\ncoast are situated the jetties to protect the intake and restitution points of the EDP thermoelectric power \n\nplant. Right beyond the jetties southwards begins the popular highly visited beach of \u201cS\u00e3o Torpes\u201d \n\nwhich is already a part of the natural park \u201cCosta Vicentina\u201d (see figure 3.1 b). The main port areas and \n\nVasco da Gama beach have their coastline facing southwards. The main tsunamigenic sources are \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     25 \n\nlocated south of the study area. Due to its openness and exposure to the sea, the impact of tsunamis and \n\nother marine hazards like sea level rise are of great concern for the area.  \n\nIn order to guarantee a good representation of the study area, we built a high-resolution Digital Elevation \n\nModel (DEM). We combined three different datasets and set them to the same reference system using \n\nGIS tools (Geographic Information System). We validated the final dataset using real time kinetic GPS \n\non field trips. The DEM is crucial for computation of inundation on the dry land and near shore \n\npropagation.  \n\nDifferent types of datasets were used: a set of high resolution LIDAR dataset (Dire\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral do \n\nTerrit\u00f3rio, 2013), a bathymetric model (Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico de Portugal, 2012), and a nautical chart \n\n(Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico de Portugal, 2010). The LIDAR data-set of 2011 has a resolution of 2m. The \n\ndata is available in PT-TM06/ETRS89 projection and referenced to hydrographic zero 2m underneath \n\nMSL. The data-set of the bathymetric model contains a grid based point information 100m spacing based \n\non hydrographic surveys. In the overlapping areas of LIDAR data-set and the bathymetric model \n\npreference has been given to the more recent and higher resolution LIDAR data-set. For further \n\nimprovement, the nautical chart of Sines (The nautical chart of Sines consists of 2 different charts one \n\nshowing a more detailed view of the port with a scale of 1:12500 and the general chart of the test-site \n\nwith a scale of 1:30000) was scanned, geo-referenced, and  digitized. Depth and altimetry data of the \n\nbathymetric model and the nautical charts are referenced to the hydrographic zero. All data was \n\nreferenced to MSL which lays 2m above hydrographic zero in Sines. In order to validate the final \n\ndatasets we used data field surveyed data points with GPS-RTK (Global Position System Real Time \n\nKinetic). In order to fill gaps of the LIDAR data we used GPS RTK collect data to implement a recently \n\nconstructed extension of a jetty not yet present in the data-sets. After combination, validation and \n\nadaption of the existing data-sets a grid representing the final study area with 10m resolution has been \n\ncomputed. The resulting DEM properly represents Sines test-site, especially the near shore areas, as \n\nLIDAR-Data set is of very high resolution. The 10m grid represents small rocky outcrops of the batholith \n\nin between Vasco da Gama beach and the leisure port. Other features like the connection to the main \n\njetty in front of the Multiuse, Liquid Natural Gas- and Container-terminal or the jetty at the leisure port \n\nsuffer from the low resolution. \n\n \n\n3 Numerical Model and Nested Grids \n\nNumerical modelling of tsunamis is commonly divided into three stages: generation, propagation, and \n\ninundation. We use an in-house developed and benchmarked numerical code NSWING (Non-linear \n\nShallow Water Model with Nested Grids) (Miranda et al., 2014) to model the tsunami. The model \n\nsupposes an instant seabed deformation that has been rendered using the half-space elastic theory \n\n(Okada, 1985) embedded in Mirone suite (Luis, 2007). The vertical sea bottom deformation is assumed \n\nto be equal to the free surface deformation and transferred to the ocean surface. \n\nThe code solves linear and non-linear approximations of shallow water equations (SWEs) to calculate \n\ntsunami propagation and inundation in a Cartesian or spherical reference system. In the deep ocean \n\nnonlinear convective inertia forces are of secondary order as waves travel with amplitudes much smaller \n\nthan water depths. When the tsunami enters shallow coastal areas, the non-linear convective inertia force \n\nand bottom friction become increasingly important. We applied non-linear SWEs approximations in all \n\ninstances, for deep-ocean, near-shore and on-shore propagation. \n\nNSWING employs a dynamically coupled system of nested grids and solves SWEs using an explicit \n\nstaggered finite leapfrog numerical scheme for linear terms and an upwind scheme for nonlinear terms. \n\nThe code further applies a radiating boundary condition, allowing wave motion pass from one domain \n\nto other, through boundaries with very small reflections. A moving boundary algorithm (Liu et al., \n\n1995), based on \u201cwet\u201d and \u201cdry\u201d cells, is adopted to track shoreline movement while inundation. \n\nPropagation and behaviour of tsunamis change because of varying bathymetry when entering coastal \n\nareas. To model the impact in Sines we implement a dynamically coupled system of nested grids. We \n\ninterpolated the half minute North Atlantic grid (GEBCO, 2014) to 640m resolution for the parent grid. \n\nUsing four layers and applying a refinement factor of 4 we achieved 10m final resolution in the DEM.  \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     26 \n\nThe amplitude of the tide in south-west Portugal is above 2m and must be taken into account in Sines. \n\n(Baptista et al., 2011a) To study the tide effect, the tidal variation of the last three years have been \n\nconsidered.  We used the values of Mean High Water (MHW) and Mean Low Water (MLW) from 2012 \n\nto 2014 and calculated the mean to obtain the MHHW and MLLW respectively and referenced them to \n\nMSL. The MHHW is 1.22m above the MSL and the MLLW 0.88m underneath the MSL. These values \n\nhave been subtracted and added respectively to the established DEM. For each designed scenario we ran \n\nthe model in MHHW, MSL and MLLW conditions to study the static influence of the tide and is \n\npresented in the aggregate scenario (Antunes, 2014).  \n\n \n\n4 Tsunamigenic Scenarios \n\nTo design the tsunami scenarios we use the main seismogenic source zones and the associated Maximum \n\nCredible Earthquake (MCE) (Miranda et al., 2008 and Omira et al., 2009). We used the typical fault \n\n(TF) for each MCE. In this study we use the TF presented in Omira et al. (2009).  \n\nThe seismogenic sources used here are SWIM and Gloria. For this study we considered four TFs in the \n\nSWIM area and their MCE scenarios to reproduce initial condition for tsunami propagation namely: the \n\nCadiz Wedge Fault (CWF), the Gorringe Bank Fault (GBF), the Horseshoe Fault (HSF) and the Marques \n\nPombal Fault (MPF) (Fig. 3.2). Additionally we use a seismogenic scenario consisting of a composite \n\nrupture of HSF and MPF (HSMPF), believed to have caused the 1st November 1755 event (Ribeiro et \n\nal., 2006). \n\nThe major tsunami event in the SWIM is the one associated with the 1st November 1755 earthquake \n\nand the exact source remains unknown. Numerous studies and campaigns have been carried out in order \n\nto solve the quest of the 1st November 1755 tsunamis source. Data (multi-channel reflection seismic, \n\nrefraction seismic, multi beam swath Bathymetry) has been gathered to reveal more accurate information \n\nof the tectonic in the SWIM. These investigation in the SWIM revealed numerous geological evidences \n\nof the used TFs. Several authors proposed distinct sources for this event. \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     27 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 TFs used for Tsunami modeling in the SWIM. Dextral reverse faults: Gorringe Bank fault \n(GBF), Marques Pombal fault (MPF), Horseshoe fault (HSF); Subduction slab: Cadiz Wedge Fault \n\n(CWF). \n\nJohnston (1996) suggested the GBF as a possible candidate source of the 1st November 1755 event \n\nthrough scale comparison of isoseismal maps with the 28th February 1969 event (c.f. Fig 3.2). Using \n\ntsunami backward ray tracing methods Baptista et al., (1998) suggested a source location for the 1755 \n\nTsunami closer to the Portuguese coast. Zitellini et al. (1999) found an active thrust fault, the MPF \n\nthrough interpretation of multi-channel seismic data (c.f. Fig 3.2). Gutscher et al. (2002) concluded that \n\nthe identified active subduction, the CWF is a candidate source for 1755 event and must be considered \n\nin natural hazard assessments (c.f. Fig 3.2). Further neo-tectonic structures and deformed seafloor \n\nsediments at the HSF also show clusters with shallow seismicity (Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003) (c.f. Fig 3.2). Some \n\nauthors suggest to consider multiple fault rupture scenarios to explain the high magnitude observed in \n\n1755 (Zitellini et al., 2001, Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003, Ribeiro et al., 2006, Mendes-Victor et al., 2005). \n\nNevertheless the exact source of the 1755 Lisbon event is still a matter of discussion. These uncertainties \n\nrelated to 1755 source and the tectonic processes acting in the SWIM confirm the need of systematic \n\ntsunami hazard assessment in surrounding areas. \n\nThe Gloria zone is our far field source area. The Gloria fault is a transform fault running from 24\u00b0 West \n\nto 19\u00b0 West (Laughton and Whitmarsh, 1974). Three strong magnitude earthquakes occurred in the last \n\n130 years: 22 December 1884 (Moreira, 1984), 25 November 1941 \u2013 Magnitude 8.3 (Gutenberg and \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     28 \n\nRichter, 1949, Moreira, 1984) and 25 May 1975 \u2013 magnitude 7.9 (Lynnes and Ruff, 1975 and Grimson \n\nand Chen, 1986). The 25 November 1941 and the 26 May 1975 produced small tsunamis recorded in \n\nthe tide stations in the North East Atlantic basin (Debrach, 1946, Moreira, 1984, Baptista et al., 1992, \n\nBaptista and Miranda, 2009). The 25 November 1941 epicenter location and the focal mechanism are \n\npresented in Baptista et al. (2011b). We used these parameters to draw a 1941 like scenario for the Gloria \n\nsource zone. The TF parameters are presented in table 3.1 and the fault is presented in figure 3.3. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 Dimension and geographic location of the Gloria fault (red line) considered in this study. \n\nTable 3.1 Fault parameters of the tsunamigenic sources considered in this study. \n\nFault L [km] W[km] Rake [\u00b0] Strike [\u00b0] Dip [\u00b0] Slip [m] Depth [km] ?

For each typical fault we considered three tide conditions: Mean \n\nLower Low Water (MLLW), Mean Sea Level (MSL) and Mean Higher High Water (MHHW). The \n\nresults are presented in integrated maps of maximum wave height (MWH), maximum flow depth \n\n(MFD), maximum drawback (MDB) and maximum run up (MRU) (Fig. 3.4 a-e). For the scenarios at \n\nMSL, we additionally present synthetic waveforms (Fig. 3.5 and 3.6) at chosen positions (Fig. 3.1-b).  \n\nIn figure 3.7 we present the aggregate scenario considering all calculated models. Figure 3.8 shows the \n\ninundation and the drawback limits considering the aggregate scenarios at the three tide conditions.  \n\n5.1 MSL Results  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 Results of MWH, MFD, MDB and MRU of the SWIM scenarios considering MSL: (a) CWF, \n(b) GBF, (c) HSF, (d) HSMPF, (e) MPF. \n\nThe analysis of figures 3.4 and 3.5 shows that all SWIM scenarios produce heavier inundation and \n\ndrawback in comparison to the Gloria fault scenario. The Gloria scenario produces MWH values of \n\napproximately 1m while the SWIM scenarios produce MWH above 10m. Figures 3.4-3.6 present results \n\nof the individual scenarios and their absolute values are summarized in table 3.2. The HSMPF scenario, \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     30 \n\ncorresponding to the worst case scenario, produces 18.6m of MWH and 3.47 km\u00b2 of inundated area. \n\nDetailed analysis of figure 3.4-d shows flow depths greater than 0.5m in 90% of the inundation area.  \n\nThe GBF and HSF scenarios, with MWH above 15m, also produce inundation above 3 km\u00b2 (cf. table \n\n3.2 and Fig. 3.4-b and Fig. 3.4-c). The remaining SWIM scenarios (CWF and MPF) still produce MWH \n\nabove 10m and leave more than 2 km\u00b2 inundated.  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5 Synthetic waveforms for 6h propagation time at 3 chosen points (cf. Fig. 3.1) for the SWIM \nscenarios: (a) CWF, (b) GBF, (c) HSF, (d) HSMPF, (e) MPF. \n\nAmong the SWIM scenarios, the MPF produces the weakest impact in Sines but still with MWH above \n\n10m (cf. Fig. 3.4-e). MRU, up to 19.3m occurs during the HSF scenario at the south of the test site. All \n\nSWIM scenarios produce sufficient drawback (see blue lines in Fig. 3.4 a-e) to leave the intake and \n\nrestitution points of the thermoelectric power plant dry. MDB occurs during the composite tsunami \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     31 \n\nmodel HSMPF. The Gloria scenario produces 1.2m MWH in certain areas and inundates low lying areas \n\nsuch as beaches. The flooded area of the Gloria scenario is less than 0.2km\u00b2 and the area at the intake \n\nand restitution points does not stay dry ( Fig. 3.6-a and Table 3.2). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.6 (a) Results MWH, MFD, MDB and MRU for the Gloria scenario, (b) synthetic waveform for \n6h propagation time a 3 chosen points (cf. Fig. 3.1) for the Gloria scenario. \n\nThe analysis of the synthetic waveforms at the virtual stations shows similar periods and tsunami travel \n\ntime (see figure 3.5) for all SWIM scenarios. First arrival occurs in all records at point P3 (blue curves \n\nin Fig. 3.5 and Fig. 3.6-b). Clearly distinguishable are the records for the Gloria scenario presented in \n\nFig. 3.6-b which shows an arrival time of about 85 minutes after initial sea surface displacement. The \n\nmaximum amplitude is about 0.4m with a period of approximately 10 minutes (Fig. 3.6-b). The record \n\nin tide gauge point P2, at 5.6m depth right in front of the intake and restitution points, confirms that no \n\nconsiderable drawback is happening throughout the event (Fig. 3.6-b). The records of the SWIM \n\nscenarios GBF, HSF, HSMPF, MPF show periods of 15 to 20 minutes and for the CWF approximately \n\n25 minutes. Maximum amplitudes are obtained at the tide gauge P2 for the tsunamis produced by CWF \n\nat the 3rd wave, HSF and HSMPF at the 1st and 3rd wave, respectively. At point P2 waveforms indicate \n\nthat the cell stays at least once dry for all SWIM scenarios (Fig. 3.5). Attenuation is visible for all \n\nscenarios after 6 hours runtime except for the Gloria scenario where attenuation occurs after 15 hours. \n\nTable 3.2 Synthesis of the Results: MFD, MWH, inundated area, MDB, MRU and arrival time \nfor all scenarios at MSL. \n\nScenario \n\n(MSL) \nMFD [m] MWH [m] Inundated Area [km\u00b2] MDB [km\u00b2] MRU [m] Arrival Time [min] \n\nCWF 12.2 12.8 2.71 2.98 14.1 38 \n\nHSF 13.3 15.7 3.16 3.37 19.3 30 \n\nGBF 12.4 17.1 3.18 3.02 18.9 25 \n\nHSMPF 13.1 18.6 3.47 3.80 17.5 22 \n\nMPF 9.1 10.7 2.07 1.98 11.3 22 \n\nGloria 0.9 1.2 0.19 0.22 4.3 85 \n\n \n\n5.2 The aggregate scenario and the influence of the tide \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     32 \n\nThe aggregate scenario map depicts the extreme hazard values field point by takin the envelope of all \n\nindividual scenarios. We present aggregate scenarios of MWH, MFD, MDB and MRU for the different \n\ntide conditions (Fig. 3.7). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7 MWH, MFD, MDB and MRU for the aggregate scenario considering all stages of the tide. \n\nThe aggregate scenario map (Fig. 3.7), considering all stages of the tide, shows 4.8km\u00b2 MDB area and \n\n4.1km\u00b2 maximum inundated area. MRU values over 20m occur close to the cliffs at Vasco da Gama \n\nbeach and is reached in MHHW condition. In other areas, such as behind the liquid bulks and \n\npetrochemical terminal and at the railway connection to the port, MRU values exceed 15m. MWHs \n\nabove 10m have been modelled along the entire coastline (Fig. 3.7). In high tide condition the inundation \n\narea is over 4km\u00b2 and 3.5km\u00b2 in low tide condition considering the aggregate scenario. Inundation area \n\nis 5% bigger at MSL and 14% at MHHW compared to MLLW (Fig. 3.8). MDB area is 16% greater at \n\nMLLW and 11% greater at MSL than in MHHW conditions (Fig. 3.8). The flooded area at Vasco da \n\nGama beach is not significantly bigger at MHHW as the area behind the beach is confined by the steep \n\ntopography. Moreover figure 3.7 shows that the mean MFD values are about 1.5m higher at MHHW \n\nthan at MLLW in the area of the beach. Other areas behind the multipurpose and container terminal or \n\nat S\u00e3o Torpes beach show clearly greater inundation areas in high tide condition (Fig. 3.8). The limits \n\nof MDB and MRU for the aggregate scenario concerning MLLW, MSL and MHHW are mapped in \n\nfigure 3.8.  \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     33 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8 MDB and MRU limits for the stages MLLW, MSL and MHHW of the tide. \n\n6 Discussion and Conclusions \n\nWe ran a total of 18 scenarios to study the tsunami impact at Sines. Our results show that all SWIM \n\nscenarios cause severe inundation and drawback. To complement the integrated hazard maps of MWH, \n\nMFD, MDB and MRU we recorded synthetic waveforms at chosen points (see figure 3.1). The signals \n\nof the waveforms are diverse. This fact may be explained due to differences in the TF parameters. \n\nWaveforms from HSF, MPF, GBF and HSMPF are comparable in terms of period and arrival time (Fig. \n\n3.5a-e). These TFs are dextral reverse with SW-NE trending and the hanging block in the SE. They are \n\nall located in the SWIM area. They are distinguishable through their dimensions and slip. Other \n\nparameters like strike, dip and rake are similar. Among the single fault scenarios the GBF is the biggest \n\nsingle fault producing 17.1m MWH in the study area (see table 3.2). The HSF, although smaller, \n\nproduces a similar inundation and wave height pattern as the slip is 5m higher compared to the GBF \n\n(see table 3.1). The MPF is smaller in terms of dimensions and has a slip of 8m and therefore produces \n\nthe weakest tsunami in the SWIM (Table 3.1 and Fig. 3.4-e). Nevertheless, MWHs are above 10m and \n\nMPF is the nearest fault to the test-site, that produces short tsunami travel time (22 minutes in figure \n\n3.5-e). The composite scenario HSMPF is the worst case scenario and combines the effects of both \n\nfaults: First wave arrives 22 min after the earthquake and tsunami triggered by HSMPF causes worst \n\ninundation and drawback in Sines. The CWF is a subduction slab and has different fault parameters \n\ncompared to the other TFs in the SWIM. The shallow east dipping slab has dimensions of 170x200km \n\nand a slip of 20m (see table 3.1). The analysis of the waveforms shows that wave periods generated by \n\nthe CWF are larger than the others from the TFs in the SWIM. This fact may be explained by the larger \n\ndisplaced area by this scenario. Cape St. Vincent (Fig. 3.2) in the southwest of Portugal might act as an \n\nobstacle to the tsunami leading to reduce the impact. The CWF has higher impact in the southern part \n\nof the study area but with decreasing inundation and amplitudes towards the north. Nevertheless, wave \n\namplitudes of 5m cause considerable inundation in the northern part of the port. The waves produced \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     34 \n\nby CWF reach Sines 38 minutes after the earthquake (Table 3.2). The Gloria fault located at 37\u00b0N \n\nbetween 14\u00b0W and 24\u00b0W produces the smallest inundation in the study area. It is a transform fault \n\ntriggering slight vertical movement because of 160\u00b0 rake with a slip of 11m (Table 3.2). The scenario \n\nproduces amplitudes between 0.3-0.4m with approximately 10 minute period (Fig. 3.6-b). The \n\nearthquake in 1941 generated similar waveforms showing weak attenuation with amplitudes around \n\n0.4m in Cascais (Baptista et al., 1992; Baptista and Miranda, 2009). Site effects, observed in some few \n\ncoastal locations (Fig. 3.6-a), caused MWH over 1m with some smaller inundation in unhabituated area \n\nbetween the container terminal and the intake and restitution points of the EDP power plant. Because of \n\nthe larger distance to the Portuguese coast the tsunami travel time is approximately 85 minutes (Table \n\n3.2).  \n\nThe tide has important influence on tsunami impact in Sines. The tidal regime is semi-diurnal with an \n\namplitude of about 2m. As expected the aggregate scenario at MHHW condition caused larger \n\ninundation areas and higher MFD values. On the other hand the aggregate scenario at MLLW produced \n\nlarger drawback areas. A tsunami impact at low tide does not exclude the risk of heavy inundation and \n\nincreases MDB by 16% compared to MHHW (Fig. 3.8).  \n\nWe computed a map showing the contribution of the individual scenarios to the aggregated scenario at \n\nMSL (Fig. 3.9). Four scenarios contribute to the aggregate scenario, namely CWF, GBF, HSF and \n\nHSMPF. The main actor in the aggregated model is the HSMPF scenario that contributes with more \n\nthan 60% independent of the tidal amplitude (Table 3.3). The scenarios CWF, GBF, HSF contribute \n\nabout 12\u00b14% to the aggregate model. The MPF and Gloria do not contribute to the aggregate scenario \n\n(Fig. 3.9). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9 Contribution of individual scenarios to the aggregate model at MSL. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3.3 Contribution of the scenarios to the aggregate model considering 3 stages of the \ntide. \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     35 \n\nScenario CWF [%] GBF [%] HSF [%] HSMPF [%] \n\nAGG MHHW 8.3 15.8 9.9 66 \n\nAGG MSL 15.1 12.4 10.0 62.5 \n\nAGG MLLW 16.8 11.7 11.1 60.3 \n\n \n\nConcluding we find that all SWIM scenarios (CWF, GBF, HSF, MPF and HSMPF) demonstrate high \n\nimpact in Sines test site. Still the weakest source, the MPF, causes considerable inundation and MWH \n\nabove 10m. The proximity of the faults within the SWIM results in short tsunami travel times. For the \n\nmodels MPF and HSMPF we calculated 22 minutes propagation time from the source to Sines test site. \n\nThis closeness to possible tsunami sources raise the need of an efficient early warning system and \n\nmeticulously planned evacuation for the port and other coastal areas. Also, coastal societies need to be \n\neducated and prepared for possible tsunami impact. \n\nThe Gloria fault differs from the other scenarios and produces MWH of approximately 1m in certain \n\nareas, one order of magnitude less than the scenarios in the SWIM. \n\nThe aggregate scenario allows to consider a set of faults to produce a synthesis of different scenarios. \n\nWe further state the importance of this tool as important indicator for evacuation and city planners. We \n\nshowed with the contribution map that different sources play varying importance in our study area. \n\nAlthough the worst case scenario may contribute more to the aggregate scenario than other considered \n\nfaults, still other faults may have more significant impact on other parts of the test-site. The aggregate \n\nscenario is a valuable tool. Especially in areas exposed to threat from near-field sources, the aggregate \n\nscenario maps helps establishing accurate evacuation plans and thus allowing efficient and faster \n\nreaction to tsunami warning.  \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements  \n\nThis work is funded by ASTARTE - Assessment, Strategy And Risk Reduction for Tsunamis in Europe \n\n- FP7- ENV2013 6.4-3, Grant 603839.

Discussion \n\nThe DTHA method was successfully applied to the study area in Sines. In the framework of ASTRATE \n\nI ran a total of eighteen scenarios using six typical faults associated with; CWF, GBF, HSF, MPF, \n\nHSMPF and Gloria for three stages of the tide (MLLW, MSL and MHHW). The results presented consist \n\nof integrated hazard maps for each scenario in MSL conditions and for the aggregate scenario (Fig. 3.4, \n\n3.6 and 3.7). The influence of the tide in respect with the maximum inundation area and the maximum \n\nsea withdrawal is shown and I compared the impact of the aggregate scenario for three tide conditions \n\n(Fig. 3.8). In figure 3.9 the contribution to MWH offshore and MFD on land of each single scenario to \n\nthe aggregate scenarios is presented. The results show that the composite fault HSMPF corresponds to \n\nworst case scenario in terms of tsunami impact.  \n\nThe analysis of the synthetic waveforms confirms three different types of faults: \n\n1.) The Gloria fault as a transform fault produces the weakest impact and a tsunami travel time of \n85 min at the test site. \n\n2.) The typical thrust faults GBF, MPF and HSF generating heavy impact, short tsunami travel \ntimes (22 min in case of MPF, 25 min in case of GBF and 30 min in HSF)  \n\n3.) Subduction slab with bigger rupture area producing higher periods and severe impact in Sines \nwith 38 min tsunami travel time.  \n\nAll faults located in the SWIM produce heavy impact scenarios when considering the MCE scenario. \n\nThe tsunami arrival time is less than 40 minutes for all SWIM scenarios. The GF causes inundation at \n\nthe beaches but leaves the harbour area dry even in MHHW conditions.  \n\nIn consideration of the DTHA the discussion must be approached from a different point of view. In the \n\npapers by Tinti et al. (2011) the DTHA is considered as indispensable tool for tsunami mitigation \n\nmeasures and for tsunami warning systems. This approach has been successfully applied for tsunami \n\nhazard assessment, vulnerability analysis for specific locations around the world and along the \n\nPortuguese, Spanish and Moroccan coastline.  \n\nThe quest of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake location and the high seismicity in the region favoured the \n\nintense investigations in the SWIM. The studies published in the last decades revealed successively \n\nmore information and details of the study area. Bathymetric studies delivered details about the SWIMs \n\nmorphology. Upon that seismic reflection and tomography allowed to obtain knowledge about the TFs \n\nand their potential in SWIM. This successive investigation led from a diffuse view to a clearer picture \n\nof SWIM. Nowadays thanks to these intense investigation the parameters of the TFs are well defined. \n\nThis unequivocal physical definition of the TFs is a clear advantage for the DTHA. \n\nThis work presents an application of DTHA methodology to Sines. The study area contains numerous \n\ncritical and fragile infrastructure. The application of DTHA delivers important information for \n\nmunicipality and port authorities about the tsunami impact. MFD values and inundation area describe \n\nwhich part on land will be affected in height and extension. MDB values show the maximum sea \n\nwithdrawal. Subsequently mitigation measures must be established to reduce loss of life and property \n\nand damage in case of impact. \n\nThe DTHA is not the only Tsunami Hazard Assessment approach. The Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard \n\nAssessment (PTHA) employs large data bases considering a large number of possible scenarios and \n\ntheir corresponding recurrence rates. In case of PTHA studies the longer geological evidences reach \n\nback the more confidently can be calculated recurrence rates. Omira et al. (2015) published a \n\nprobabilistic tsunami hazard assessment for the entire North East Atlantic. However, probabilistic \n\nstudies should be interpreted carefully and must not be considered to establish mitigation measures. For \n\nthe mitigation measures and coastal engineering the DTHA is more appropriate as the MCE scenarios \n\nare considered. Results are easier to interpret and deliver clear limits of maximum inundation area and \n\nvalues of MFD. A comprehensive study should include both methods DTHA and PTHA presenting both \n\nworst case and exceeding maximum wave heights with likelihood estimations.  \n\nDTHA has inherent limitations. The initial condition of the tsunami model, initial sea surface elevation \n\nthe limitations of the simulation model and the DEM.  To calculate the initial condition the model used \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     40 \n\nconsiders the fault area to be rectangular. Although this is nearly never the case, this approximation is \n\nconsidered valid as considered fault areas are usually big (hundreds of square kilometres) and can be \n\nreduced to simpler geometry. The initial condition is calculated on base of the elastic half space theory \n\n(Okada, 1985). The parameters used are estimated upon geological constraints obtained from recent \n\nyear\u2019s investigation. \n\nAnother limitation of the model used is the assumption of instantaneous rupture mechanism neglecting \n\nthe dynamic of the seabed deformation. This approximation is limited in case of slow rupture velocities \n\nand tsunami earthquakes or large fault dimensions when considering mega thrust faults. However, in \n\nthe SWIM where common thrust faults and subduction zone earthquakes are dominant this assumption \n\nis valid.  \n\nTsunami propagation was calculated using the NSWING model based on the non-linear shallow water \n\nequations. This model solves the Navier-Stokes equations for water wave propagation using the \n\napproximation that vertical velocity components of water particles is negligible and horizontal motion \n\nis uniform in the entire water column of the fluid (Tinti et al. 2011). Further the ocean is considered as \n\nincompressible fluid and the initial condition is transferred to the sea surface. This assumption is valid \n\nif the wave length is much greater than the water depth. The model includes bottom friction terms but \n\nthe Manning roughness coefficient is set to zero as worst case tsunami has been assumed. When \n\ncomputing worst case tsunami scenarios it is a common procedure to set Manning roughness coefficient \n\nto zero to obtain unambiguous areas of inundation (Omira et al., 2010). The non-linear SWEs on the \n\nother hand do not include frequency dispersion terms. Their importance is discussed in literature and \n\nfrequency dispersion is assumed to play an important role for transoceanic tsunami propagation. In this \n\nstudy this is not the case as all TFs are local or regional sources. Tsunami travel times are about half an \n\nhour for the SWIM scenarios and one and a half hour for the Gloria fault. \n\nThe DEM used has a resolution of 10m. Main coastal defence structures are implemented in the model. \n\nGenerally spoken finer resolution of the DEM leads to more detailed results. However, this is often a \n\ndifficult task as high resolution data in near shore areas is often not available. The recent published \n\nLIDAR data set with 2m resolution (Dire\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral do Territ\u00f3rio, 2013) enables the computation of \n\naccurate DEMs. In spite of the high resolution on land and in the near shore areas covered the LIDAR \n\ndata set the connecting data sets (nautical charts and bathymetric) provide less information. In this areas \n\nalong the continental shelf higher resolution data is desirable. However, the DEM used in the study \n\npresents best compromise based on most actual available data sets. Main coastal defence structures and \n\nall important geological features are represented by the DEM.  \n\nDTHA is applied on small study areas commonly with major socio-economic interest, but still many \n\nlocations are left without DTHA and consequential mitigation measures. In the Gulf of Cadiz area there \n\nspecific studies applying DTHA. However, there are still many areas without appropriate tsunami hazard \n\nassessment confirming the need for more studies of DTHA along bordering coastlines. But additionally \n\nit is important to subsequently realize the right measurements to reduce impact.  \n\nFor those study areas where DTHA has been applied only little mitigation measures have been carried \n\nout so far. Still no suitable evacuation routes or clear classified tsunami-safe areas have been presented. \n\nNo signs have been placed indicating how to react at popular beaches, nor signs indicating tsunami \n\nevacuation routes. No specific tsunami training has been prepared for coastal communities. People are \n\nleft uninformed what to do in case of a tsunami. It is not the goal to apply a number DTHAs and leave \n\nthe results to a small specialized scientific community. Therefor an international standardized procedure \n\nis useful for authorities to establish mitigation measures. Up to now many efforts have been carried out \n\nto implement tsunami warning systems in the Northeast Atlantic, Mediterranean and connecting seas \n\nand many of them are operational already. However, waring is based on decision matrices in the North \n\nEast Atlantic which has some operational delay. This delay might be crucial for sites closer to the \n\nearthquake. Mitigations measures like drills and exercises must be carried out by officials to prepare \n\ncommunities for self-evacuation. The reduced death toll in the recent 16th September 2015 Chile \n\nearthquake goes back to consequent warning and self-evacuation.  \n\nConsequences due to unpreparedness may be fatal as learnt from the India Ocean Tsunami 2004. The \n\nfocus must be on successive and consequent tsunami hazard assessment in all prone coastal areas. \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     41 \n\nTsunami secure zones must be identified and indicated. Evacuation routes from impact areas must be \n\nestablished and signposted. Additionally civil protection, coast guard, maritime police, fire brigades and \n\ncoastal communities must be informed and trained how to react. The overall goal must be to create \n\ntsunami resilient and tsunami ready societies in potential risk areas. \n\nTo sum up, the DTHA is based upon certain approximation that deliver best possible solutions if chosen \n\ncorrectly. In more specific cases one should take into account the limitations existing in the \n\nmethodology. In this study the DTHA approach shows heavy impact for all SWIM scenarios. It is \n\nsuggested to begin immediately to establish evacuation plans especially for the port area and the beaches \n\nand prepare a tsunami resilient society in Sines. \n\n5. Conclusion \n\nIn this master thesis the goal was to apply a Deterministic Tsunami Hazard Assessment (DTHA) on the \n\ntest site in Sines, Portugal. The DTHA consists in studying the sources; choosing the tsunami scenarios; \n\ncomputing the initial condition; Preparation of the DEM and the set of computational grids; computation \n\nof the numerical models and analysis and interpretation of the results. All these steps were carried out \n\nsuccessfully.  \n\nThe results of the DTHA in Sines confirm that all local sources have heavy impacts in the test site. The \n\nweakest scenario in the SWIM is the MPF scenario with a maximum wave height of 10m. The composite \n\nsource HSMPF is the worst case scenario and contributes with more than 60% at all stages of the tide to \n\nthe aggregate scenario. An aggregate scenarios has been built synthesizing the effect of all possible \n\nMCE scenarios. A clear influence of the tide could be shown. Under unfavourable conditions with high \n\ntide a tsunami impact affects bigger areas in Sines. The tsunami travel time for the sources in the SWIM \n\nis less than 30 min accept for the CWF. This fact and the heavy impact of all local sources make the \n\naggregate scenario a valuable output for authorities and city planners. The regional scenario GF shows \n\nthe weakest impact inundating only parts of the beaches. With the DTHA, worst case tsunami scenarios \n\ncan be modelled giving the most important parameter to describe the impact at the test-site. These results \n\nhowever do not represent probabilities of a tsunami impact. In an ideal case the DTHA can be \n\ncomplemented with a Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment (PTHA). Omira et al. (2015) complete \n\nthe results found in this thesis using PTHA in the same test site. \n\nThe DTHA is the only method that produces easy to interpret results that can be immediately used for \n\nprofound mitigation measures. The limitations of the approach must be considered and justified \n\nthroughout the proceeding, to convey best possible and doubtless results. By defining an international \n\nstandardized procedure for this approach could help to make it easier to use, to interpret and to establish \n\nmitigation measures. Future investigation on the numerical models making them more efficient and \n\nexact may play a key role for tsunami warning systems. If the rupture mechanism of a submarine \n\nearthquake are identified rapidly DTHA analyses will enable scientists to elaborate tsunami hazard maps \n\nbefore impact. Nevertheless society must be trained and models prepared. But when considering local \n\nsources efficient mitigation measures are indispensable.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nDeterministic Tsunami Hazard assessment for Sines, Portugal \n\nMartin Wronna                     42 \n\n6.
