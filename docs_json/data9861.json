However, from the spatial point of view, there was a high inverse \ncorrelation between forage dry matter with microporosity, so that microporosity \nin the 0\u20130.10 m layer can be considered a good indicator of soil physical quality, \nwith a view to corn forage yield.\n\nindex terms: soil physical properties, soil management, geostatistics, no-tillage, \nforage crops.\n\n(1) received for publication in december 16, 2010 and approved in november 11, 2011.\n(2) phd Student in agronomy (Soil Science), University of agriculture Science and Veterinary, UneSp \u2013 Jaboticabal Campus, \n\ndepartment of rural engineering. avenida Brasil 56, Centro, Cep 15385-000 ilha Solteira (Sp). e-mail: ca.chioderoli@uol.com.br\n(3) professor of the department of phytosanity, Soil and rural engeneering, UneSp \u2013 ilha Solteira Campus. e-mail: malcolm@agr.feis.unesp.br\n(4) Master\u2019s degree in agronomy (Crop production), UneSp \u2013 Jaboticabal Campus, department of rural engineering. e-mail: \n\nrafnor86@yahoo.com.br\n(5) phd Student in Zootechny (nutrition and animal production), UneSp \u2013 Butucatu Campus. e-mail: cmpariz@hotmail.com.br \n(6) phd in agronomy (Vegetable production System), UneSp \u2013 ilha Solteira Campus. e-mail: rclima@agr.feis.unesp.br\n\n\n\n766 Carlos alessandro Chioderoli et al.\n\nr.

Desta forma, o trabalho teve como objetivo determinar \na variabilidade e as correla\u00e7\u00f5es lineares e especiais entre os atributos da planta e do solo, \nvisando selecionar um indicador da qualidade f\u00edsica do solo de boa representatividade \npara produ\u00e7\u00e3o de forragem. No  ano agr\u00edcola de 2006, na Fazenda Bonan\u00e7a, munic\u00edpio de \nPereira Barreto (SP), foram analisados a produtividade de forragem do milho outonal (FDM) \nem sistema plantio direto irrigado e os atributos f\u00edsicos do solo, num Latossolo Vermelho \ndistr\u00f3fico.  O objetivo foi estudar a variabilidade e as correla\u00e7\u00f5es lineares e espaciais entre \nos atributos da planta e os do solo, visando selecionar um indicador da qualidade f\u00edsica do \nsolo de boa representatividade para a produtividade da forragem.  Foi instalada a malha \ngeoestat\u00edstica, para coleta de dados do solo e planta, contendo 125 pontos amostrais, numa \n\u00e1rea de 2.500 m2.  Os atributos estudados, al\u00e9m de n\u00e3o terem variado aleatoriamente, \napresentaram variabilidade dos dados entre baixa e muito alta e seguiram padr\u00f5es espaciais \nbem definidos, com alcances entre 7,8 e 38,0 m.  Por outro lado, a correla\u00e7\u00e3o linear entre \nos atributos da planta com o do solo foi baixa e extremamente significativa. Os pares \nMassa Seca de forragem versus Microporosidade e Di\u00e2metro do colmo versus Densidade \ndo Solo foram melhor correlacionados na camada de 0-0.10m, enquanto os outros pares \n\u2013 Massa Seca de Forragem versus Macroporosidade \u2013 e Porosidade Total \u2013 apresentaram \ncorrela\u00e7\u00e3o inversa para a mesma camada. Entretanto, do ponto de vista espacial, houve \numa alta correla\u00e7\u00e3o inversa entre Massa Seca de Forragem com Microporosidade, de modo \nque a microporosidade na camada de 0-0.10m pode ser considerada um bom indicador de \nqualidade f\u00edsica do solo, tendo em vista a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de forragem de milho.\n\nTermos de indexa\u00e7\u00e3o: atributos f\u00edsicos do solo, manejo do solo, geoestat\u00edstica, semeadura \ndireta, forragicultura.\n\nintrodUCtion\n\nthe soil compaction degree is expressed by the \nphysical indicator of penetration resistance, and it \nis related positively with bulk density of soil, but \nnegatively with macroporosity.  High compaction \ndegree affects the development of the root system \n(Bergamin et al., 2010).\n\naccording to Foloni et al. (2003), physical \nbarriers in the subsoil alter the distribution of the \nroot system of maize plants along the soil profile, \nhowever, the total root yield does not decrease.  \nthe authors further stated that a compacted \nsoil layer with penetration resistance of 1.4 Mpa \nprevents maize roots from penetrating this layer \nand extending into the deeper ones.\n\nBulk density is closely related with other \nproperties, as shown in a large number of studies \nindicating that increasing density causes reductions \nin total porosity, macroporosity, hydraulic \nconductivity, ion absorption, as well as increased \nmicroporosity and soil resistance to mechanical \npenetration.  this general scenario results in \ndecreased agricultural productivity (Secco et al., \n2005; Mello Filho et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2006).\n\nSoil compaction causes maize yield losses because \nof the physical changes in the root environment \n\n(debiasi et al., 2010).  also, the pore arrangement \nand size affect soil water retention, water availability \nto plants due to lower porosity and aeration, as \nwell as soil penetration resistance (Cavalieri et al., \n2006), limiting the soil depth and volume explored \nby the roots.\n\nassis &amp; lan\u00e7as (2004) verified a decrease in \nsoil bulk density after 12 years, related to the time \nof adoption of no-tillage system.  they observed a \ndiversity of responses to the same management \nsystem according to the different soil, plant, climate \nand other characteristics.  the highest values of \nsoil bulk density in the first years of the no-tillage \nsystem were caused by the absence of soil tillage, \nbut over the years the undesirable effect of this \ncompaction disappears, as the no-till system is \nestablished properly.\n\naccording to Mercante et al. (2003) and Secco et \nal. (2005), total porosity is strongly related with soil \ncompaction and penetration resistance, which tend \nto increase with the reduction of pore space.  the \ndensity and pore space can be used as indicators \nof soil quality according to the soil management.  \na continuous assessment over time of these soil \nphysical properties, can indicate how efficient these \nmanagement systems are in terms of structural \nstability (Secco et al., 2005).\n\n\n\n           Spatial and linear CorrelationS Between Soil and Corn                               767\n\nr.

Fertilization \nconsisted of 320 kg ha-1 of npK fertilizer (08-28-16) \nand of fertirrigation with two applications of 106 kg \nurea, 16 and 38 days after maize sowing (daS) and \nan application of potassium chloride of 150 kg ha-1, \n23 daS.\n\nthe experimental grid consisted of a total of 125 \nsampling points, distributed over an area of 2500 m2 \n(50 x 50 m), with an average slope of 0.025 m m-1, \nand sample points spaced 5 m apart and in the finer \n\ngrid 1 m, established to detect ranges of spatial \ndependence for smaller spacing conditions than of \nthe large grid.\n\nin this way, the evaluation areas used to collect \nsoil and plant data were defined: a) large grid, width \n3.40 m (4 plant rows) by 3.40 m in the direction of \nthe row, covering an area of 11.56 m2, and b) grid \nrefinement on the x axis, with 2.55 m (3 rows) by \n1.00 m, evaluation area of 2.55 m2, and on the y \naxis, with 1.70 m (2 rows) by 1.50 m, evaluation \narea of 2.55 m2.\n\nthe soil physical characteristics assessed per \nsampling point were bulk density (Bd), macroporosity \n(Ma), microporosity (Mi) and total porosity (tp), \nsampled from the layers 0.00\u20130.10, 0.10\u20130.20 and \n0.20\u20130.30 m, 120 days after seeding, analyzed by the \nvolumetric ring method (embrapa, 1997), identified \nas Bd1, Ma1, Mi1 and tp1 in the layer 0.00\u20130.10 m; \nBd2, Ma2, Mi2, and tp2 in the layer 0.10\u20130.20 m; and \nBd3, Ma3, Mi3, and tp3 in the layer 0.20\u20130.30 m, \nwere analyzed at a laboratory of the Faculdade de \nengenharia de ilha Solteira (FeiS/UneSp).\n\nthe forage dry matter (FdM) was assessed \n110 daS individually for each sample point, by \noven-drying at 65 \u00b0C to constant weight.  By \nclassical descriptive analysis, the average, median, \nminimum and maximum standard deviation, \ncoefficient of variation, kurtosis, skewness, and \nanalysis of frequency distribution were calculated \nand normality tested.  outliers were replaced by \nthe average value of the surrounding grid points.\n\nthe highest simple linear correlations were \nadopted that could present the cross-semivariogram \nand therefore co-kriging performance.  Cross-\nvalidation is a tool to evaluate alternative models \nof simple and cross-semivariograms that perform \nkriging and co-kriging, respectively.  So, to obtain \nthe optimum number of neighbors, kriging and co-\nkriging maps were obtained by interpolation, for the \nanalysis of spatial dependence and interdependence \nbetween properties.\n\nMultiple linear regression was used for the soil \nlayers studied by means of the plant dependent \nvariable (FdM) and of the soil independent \nvariables (soil properties), in order to select the \nbest relations between cause and effect, assessed \nby the determination coefficient, using the extra \nstep of SaS.\n\nreSUltS\n\ndescriptive statistics showed that for corn forage \nyield and soil properties (table 1), the variability \nfor FdM, and Ma2c and Ma3c was average, and \nhigh for Ma1, unlike of the other properties, with \n\n\n\n768 Carlos alessandro Chioderoli et al.\n\nr.

Solo, 36:765-773, 2012\n\ndiSCUSSion\n\nthe variability of a property can be classified \naccording to the magnitude of the variation \ncoefficient (Freddi et al., 2006).  in this study, \nthe variability of FdM, Ma2c and the Ma3c was \naverage, of Ma1 it was high and for the other \nvariables low (table 1), in agreement with Carvalho \net al. (2002, 2003), Johann et al. (2004), Souza \net al. (2004a, b) and Grego &amp; Vieira (2005).  Soil \nvariability is the product of interaction between \nthe factors and processes of its formation, soil \nmanagement and tilling.  these factors are also \ndeterminant for the heterogeneity, observed in the \nMa1 results, where the minimum tillage performed \nby the no-tillage seeder resulted in the highest \ncoefficients of variation observed in the first layer.\n\nthe high rooting in the soil surface from previous \ncrops can result in a very porous soil structure \nand, consequently, increase forage yields in the \nfollowing growing seasons, corroborating Freddi et \nal. (2008), who stated that yields are correlated with \nan adequate development of the aboveground plant \nparts, at lower soil density, providing higher root \ndry matter production.  according to Souza neto \net al. (2008) and ara\u00fajo et al. (2010) reported that the \nsoil physical properties and maize productivity in no-\ntillage systems promoted higher aggregate stability \nand soil bulk density in the surface layer, without \nchanging the content of water available to plants.\n\nthe frequency distribution of macroporosity \nwas indefinite in the surface layer (Ma1).  in the \nsubsurface (Ma2, Ma3), lognormal distribution \nwas observed, with increased soil compaction in \nthe second and third layers, in agreement with \nSouza et al. (2001), Carvalho et al. (2002) and Melo \nFilho et al. (2006).  in conservation tillage systems, \nthe action of roots, macro and micro-organisms \npromoted a good macropore volume, and the mulch \nof crop residues on the surface retained soil moisture \n(lima et al., 2006).  Compression pressure applied to \nthe soil can induce pore space reduction, especially \nof macropores (dexter et al., 2007), whereas the \nmicropores under pressure may be full of water \nand, because of the low hydraulic conductivity and \nincompressibility of water, may be able to resist \nstress better over short time intervals than air-filled \nmacropores (Kut\u00fdleka et al., 2006; Silva et al., 2009).\n\nSoil porosity (table 1) showed lognormal frequency \ndistribution for tp1b and tp3b, and for tp2, an \nindefinite distribution was observed, with average \nvalues of 0.300 m3 m-3 (tp1), 0.289 m3 m-3 (tp2) and \n0.306 m3 m-3 (tp3).  thus, the distribution of density \nvalues was not logical as they did not increase in \nthe deeper layers, in disagreement with Souza et al. \n(2001), Carvalho et al. (2002) and Melo Filho et al. \n\n(2006).  therefore, this fact may have contributed \nto a reduction of FdM, which did not reach, despite \nthe use of irrigation, the full expression of the yield \ncapacity of the maize hybrid p30F80.\n\nFor soil bulk density (table 1), the frequency \ndistribution was normal for Bd1, Bd2 and Bd3, as \nalso observed by Johann et al. (2004), Souza et al. \n(2004a), and Grego &amp; Vieira (2005).  the average \nvalues were 1.64 kg dm-3 (Bd1), 1.68 kg dm-3 (Bd2) \nand 1.67 kg dm-3 (Bd3), following a positive linear \ntrend in relation to the increase in soil depth, \ncorroborating Souza et al. (2001) and Carvalho et \nal. (2002), who reported an increased density in \ndeeper layers, due to the reduced content of organic \nmatter, and in disagreement with Grego &amp; Vieira \n(2005) and Melo Filho et al. (2006), who found a \ndecreasing gradient.\n\nthe first pair (FdM x Ma1) indicated an inverse \nfunction of cause and effect, i.e., the lower the \nmacroporosity, in the 0.00\u20130.10 m layer, the greater \nis FdM.  the second pair (FdM x Ma3c) showed \na positive correlation between cause and effect, \nindicating the increase of FdM with increasing \nmacroporosity in the 0.20\u20130.30 m layer.  this \ncorroborated pereira et al. (2010) who evaluated the \nphysical quality of a dystrophic red latosol under \ncover crops in pre-season maize, in conventional \nand no-tillage systems, and found higher values of \ntotal porosity in no-tillage than conventional tillage \nsoils (table 2).\n\nin the third pair (FdM x Mi1), due to negative \ncorrelation, ie, with lower microporosity in the \nsurface layer, FdM increased.  Scientifically \nspeaking, the fact that occurred in the third pair \nwas consistent, because when soil macroporosity \nincreases, microporosity decreases.  in the fourth \npair (FdM x tp1b), a negative correlation between \ncause and effect was observed, indicating the \nincrease of FdM with the lowest total porosity \nin the 0.00\u20130.010 m layer.  However, for the first \nand fourth pair, this fact could not be confirmed, \nsince the negative correlation of FdM x Ma1 and \nFdM x tp1b was precisely the opposite of what \nwould be consistent.\n\nthus, FdM in relation to tp1b and Std in \nrelation to Bd1 can be estimated by the following \nsimple linear regression equations:\n\n   FdM = 1.084.104 x tp1b, with r = 0.242, p &lt;0.01 (1)\n\nStd = 3.360-5.299.10-1**.  Bd1, \n   with r = 0.306, p &lt;0.01   (2)\n\nof the soil properties, the best-correlated pair \nwas Ma1 x tp1b, with the equation:\n\n\n\n772 Carlos alessandro Chioderoli et al.\n\nr. Bras. Ci. Solo, 36:765-773, 2012\n\nMa1 = -1.081.10-1+3.648.10-1**.  tp1b, \n   with r = 0.706, p &lt;0.01  (3)\n\nthe geostatistical analysis of kriging (table 2) \nshowed excellent plant and soil semivariograms \n(Figures 1 and 2).  the best-fitting was adjusted \nto #tp1b, with a spatial determination coefficient \nof 0.942, and 0.680 for FdM.  on the other hand, \nthe studied properties showed spatial dependence, \nexcept for Ma1, # Ma3c and Mi3.\n\nthus, in this study (table 2), it was found that \n76.7 % of the total FdM variation was explained by \nspatial dependence.  on the other hand, the nugget \neffect attributed to random errors was 23.3 %.  For \nthe studied properties, the adjusted models were \nexponential (FdM, Std, #Mi1, tp2, tp3b, Bd1 \nand Bd3), spherical (Ma2c, #Mi2, #tpib and Bd2) \nand the pure nugget effect (Ma1, Ma3c and #Mi3).\n\nwith regard to the soil properties, the models \nfit in this study agreed partially with Carvalho \net al. (2002), Johann et al. (2004), Souza et al. \n(2004b), Santos et al. (2006), where sometimes one, \nsometimes another model was observed.\n\nthe range of spatial dependence for FdM was \n9.7 m, so that the extreme values for the Bd and Ma \nranged from 9.0 m (Bd2) to 38.0 m (Ma2c).  these \nresults were similar to those reported by Carvalho et \nal. (2002, 2003) and Grego &amp; Vieira (2005), varying \nfrom 3.9 to 23.7 m (tp) and 1.0 to 13.1 m (Sd).\n\nBy cross-validation (table 3), the simple krigings \nfor #tp1b provided the best semivariogram fitting, \nwhich could be observed by the highest correlation \ncoefficient (r = 0.696) between observed and \npredicted values of this attribute, and by the linear \ncoefficient (a) tending to zero and the angular \ncoefficient (b) tending to one.  the correlation \ncoefficients of the other properties ranged from \n0.338 to 0.535, and the linear coefficients tended \nto 0.00 and the angular coefficients were between \n0.765 and 1.002, as similarly reported by Souza et \nal. (2001), Carvalho et al. (2002, 2003), and Santos \net al. (2006).\n\nwith regard to the co-krigings (table 3), the \nbest fit was observed for the plant property Std = f \n(Bd1), which had the highest spatial determination \ncoefficient (r2 = 0.430), as well as the appreciable \nvalues of the coefficients a (1.140) and b (0.543).  the \nperformance of the other properties was similar to \nStd, with r2 values between 0.381 and 0.424, as \nwell as values of a between 6.282.103 and 7.307.103, \nand b between 0.581 and 0.507.\n\nthus, the principle of converging evidence \nshowed that: a) Ma1 and tp1b were inversely \nand significantly correlated with FdM, b) # tp1b \n\nand tp3 showed very good simple semivariogram \nfittings (table 2) and c) the semivariogram fitting \nbetween FdM and # Mi1 (Figure 4), showed high \nspatial dependence between the plant and soil \nproperties.\n\nConClUSionS\n\n1. the studied properties followed well-defined \nspatial patterns, ranging from 7.8 to 38.0 m.\n\n2. the correlations between FdM with Ma1 and \ntp1b were negative. From the spatial viewpoint, \nthere was an excellent positive correlation between \nthe FdM and Mi1 and there was no significant \ncorrelation of FdM with bulk density in any layer.\n\n3. the linear correlation between forage dry \nmatter and soil microporosity was low, although \nextremely significant. But from the spatial viewpoint, \nthere was a high inverse correlation between these \nvariables; with increasing microporosity, forage \nproductivity decreased.\n\n4. of the soil physical properties studied, \nmicroporosity in the 0.00\u20130.10 m layer was the soil \nphysical quality that correlated best with forage \ndry matter.\n\nliteratUre Cited\n\nara\u00daJo, F.S.; SalViano, a.a.C.; leite, l.F.C.; SoUZa, Z.M. \n&amp; SoUSa, a.C.M. physical quality of a Yellow latossol \nunder integrated crop-livestock system. r.
