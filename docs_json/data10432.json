In order to \n\ninvestigate some of the effects this oxygen minimum zone may have on these coastal \n\nwaters, this study aimed to evaluate the influence of dissolved inorganic macronutrient \n\nconcentration and ratio on the elemental stoichiometry of sinking particulate matter and \n\ncarbon export. At the beginning of February 2017, eight mesocosms were deployed in \n\ncoastal waters near Lima, Peru. 4 mesocosms were enriched with an OMZ derived water \n\nmass with a dissolved inorganic N:P ratio of 0.11, while the other 4 were enriched with OMZ \n\nwater of N:P = 1.71. The amount of utilized reactive nitrogen was not associated to \n\ndifferences in carbon export rates, but the results of one individual mesocosm hint at \n\nstronger carbon export at low primary production. Furthermore, sinking particulate matter \n\nand its elemental stoichiometry did not show differences between treatments. However, \n\nour results showed clear deviations from the canonical Redfield ratio in sinking POM, \n\nhypothesized to be related with phytoplankton community composition. \n\n \n\nKeywords: oxygen minimum zone, upwelling, nutrient ratio, POM elemental stoichiometry, \n\nvertical flux, carbon export \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nVIII \n \n\nResumo \n\nOs nutrientes inorg\u00e2nicos dissolvidos s\u00e3o fundamentais para o funcionamento das redes \n\nalimentares marinhas e s\u00e3o, direta ou indiretamente, absorvidos por todos os organismos \n\nvivos. As regi\u00f5es de afloramento costeiro apresentam elevada concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de nutrientes \n\ninorg\u00e2nicos, constituindo ecossistemas marinhos muito produtivos a n\u00edvel biol\u00f3gico. Embora \n\nrepresentam apenas 1% da \u00e1rea superficial do oceano global, as \u00e1reas de afloramento \n\ncosteiro s\u00e3o respons\u00e1veis, em m\u00e9dia,por cerca de 11% da produ\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria anual nova. A \n\nvariabilidade clim\u00e1tica prevista, associada \u00e0 crescente da press\u00e3o antr\u00f3pica na atmosfera e \n\nno oceano, foi associada \u00e0 intensifica\u00e7\u00e3o e expans\u00e3o da \u00e1rea ocupada pelas zonas m\u00ednimas \n\nde oxig\u00e9nio (Oxygen Minimum Zones, OMZ), geralmente associadas aos sistemas de \n\nafloramento costeiro. Neste contexto, torna-se necess\u00e1rio avaliar e compreender as \n\nconsequ\u00eancias do aumento das OMZ sobre os  ciclos biogeoqu\u00edmicos de nutrientes, de \n\nforma a prever com rigor a variabilidade futura do ambiente marinho e aplicar estrat\u00e9gias \n\nde gest\u00e3o adequadas. \n\nOs eventos de afloramento costeiro ao largo da costa do Peru, bem como em outros \n\nsistemas similares, est\u00e3o geralmente associados ao transporte de massas de \u00e1gua sub-\n\nsuperficiais, com elevada concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de nutrientes inorg\u00e2nicos dissolvidos. Por\u00e9m, a \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de nutrientes inorg\u00e2nicos dissolvidos e as propor\u00e7\u00f5es entre as formas \n\ncontendo azoto e f\u00f3sforo (ratio N:P) variam em fun\u00e7\u00e3o da intensidade dos eventos de \n\nafloramento e dos processos que influenciam a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o e composi\u00e7\u00e3o dos nutrientes \n\nem n\u00edveis inferiores \u00e0 superf\u00edcie. O azoto inorg\u00e2nico \u00e9 um elemento essencial ao \n\ncrescimento do fitopl\u00e2ncton e, muitas vezes, limita a produtividade prim\u00e1ria, \n\ndesempenhando assim um papel crucial na biogeoqu\u00edmica marinha. As formas de azoto \n\n\n\nIX \n \n\ninorg\u00e2nico biodispon\u00edveis incluem o nitrato, nitrito e am\u00f3nia, mas constituem apenas cerca \n\nde 6% da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o total de azoto dispon\u00edvel na \u00e1gua do mar.  \n\nO f\u00f3sforo inorg\u00e2nico \u00e9 igualmente um elemento essencial ao crescimento do fitopl\u00e2ncton, \n\nsendo a principal forma biodispon\u00edvel o fosfato. Representa uma parte integrante da \n\nestrutura celular (ex.: \u00e1cidos nucleicos, incluindo DNA e RNA) e dos compostos associados \n\nao armazenamento de energia qu\u00edmica nas c\u00e9lulas, nomeadamente da mol\u00e9cula adenosina \n\ntrifosfato (ATP). Assim, a an\u00e1lise do ciclo biogeoquimico do f\u00f3sforo \u00e9 relevante para \n\ndeterminar a estrutura e fun\u00e7\u00e3o dos ecossistemas.  \n\nA exporta\u00e7\u00e3o vertical de mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica a partir da superf\u00edcie do oceano representa um \n\nprocesso chave para o funcionamento da bomba biol\u00f3gica de carbono, um componente \n\nimportante do ciclo global do carbono. O carbono inorg\u00e2nico \u00e9 absorvido sob a forma de \n\nCO2 pelo fitopl\u00e2ncton, transformado e acumulado no interior das c\u00e9lulas sob a forma de \n\ncarbono org\u00e2nico, atrav\u00e9s da fotoss\u00edntese, e transportado verticalmente para o oceano \n\nprofundo. Assim, o fluxo vertical de c\u00e9lulas fitoplanct\u00f3nicas, em estado fisiol\u00f3gico vari\u00e1vel, \n\ncontrola fortemente a capacidade do oceano como um coletor e reservat\u00f3rio de CO2. A \n\nexporta\u00e7\u00e3o vertical de material particulado \u00e9 determinada pela taxa de decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nvelocidade de afundamento do material em afundamento, bem como pela migra\u00e7\u00e3o vertical \n\ndi\u00e1ria do zoopl\u00e2ncton ativo. O material particulado em afundamento no oceano \u00e9 composto \n\npor agregados org\u00e2nicos, geralmente designados neve marinha, pelotas fecais do \n\nzoopl\u00e2ncton e fitodetritos. As part\u00edculas com reduzida velocidade de afundamento s\u00e3o \n\ngeralmente consumidas ou degradadas antes de atingir o oceano profundo. Pelo contr\u00e1rio, \n\nas part\u00edculas com elevada velocidade de afundamento apresentam maior probabilidade de \n\natingir o sedimento. A efici\u00eancia da bomba biol\u00f3gica depende ainda da composi\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\n\n\nX \n \n\ncomunidade fitoplanct\u00f3nica e, em consequ\u00eancia, das condi\u00e7\u00f5es abi\u00f3ticas do ambiente \n\nmarinho, incluindo a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o e composi\u00e7\u00e3o dos nutrientes inorg\u00e2nicos dissolvidos. \n\nO presente estudo pretende avaliar a influ\u00eancia da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o e composi\u00e7\u00e3o (ratio) dos \n\nmacronutrientes inorg\u00e2nicos dissolvidos na \u00e1gua aflorada sobre a estequiometria da \n\nmat\u00e9ria em suspens\u00e3o na plataforma continental do Peru. Os objetivos espec\u00edficos do \n\nestudo abordaram as seguintes quest\u00f5es: (1) Estar\u00e3o massas de \u00e1gua afloradas com \n\ndiferente concentra\u00e7\u00e3o e composi\u00e7\u00e3o de nutrientes (ratio N:P) associadas a diferen\u00e7as na \n\nestequiometria elementar das part\u00edculas em suspens\u00e3o e sedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o?; (2) Estar\u00e3o a \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o e a taxa de absor\u00e7\u00e3o de nutrientes relacionadas com diferen\u00e7as nas taxas de \n\nexporta\u00e7\u00e3o do carbono org\u00e2nico? \n\nO presente estudo integrou-se no Collaborative Research Center (SFB 754) \u201cClimate-\n\nBiogeochemistry Interactions in the  Tropical Ocean\u201d e baseou-se numa experi\u00eancia iniciada \n\nem fevereiro de 2017, com recurso \u00e0 plataforma Kiel Off-Shore Mesocosms for Ocean \n\nSimulations (KOSMOS), uma instala\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00f3vel de mesocosmos, aplic\u00e1vel em  experi\u00eancias \n\nem larga escala, in situ. Os mesocosmos s\u00e3o unidades experimentais com um volume \n\nelevado, apropriadas para simular eventos de afloramento, em condi\u00e7\u00f5es controladas quasi \n\nnaturais, uma vez que permitem a manipula\u00e7\u00e3o eficiente das vari\u00e1veis ambientais, incluindo \n\na concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de nutrientes. De forma a atingir os objetivos propostos, foram utilizados \n\ndois tratamentos experimentais, com quatro replicados cada (2 * 4 = 8 mesocosmos): massa \n\nde \u00e1gua com ratio N:P reduzido e massa de \u00e1gua com ratio N:P muito reduzido, a n\u00edvel da \n\ncomposi\u00e7\u00e3o de nutrientes inorg\u00e2nicos dissolvidos. No in\u00edcio de fevereiro de 2017, foram \n\nimplantados oito mesocosmos em \u00e1guas costeiras ao largo de Lima (Peru), contendo \n\narmadilhas de sedimento no interior. A experi\u00eancia decorreu durante um per\u00edodo de 50 \n\ndias, entre fevereiro e abril de 2017. Quatro mesocosmos foram enriquecidos com uma \n\n\n\nXI \n \n\nmassa de \u00e1gua amostrada na OMZ, com um ratio N: P de 0,11, enquanto os restantes quatro \n\nmesocosmos foram enriquecidos com uma massa de \u00e1gua amostrada na OMZ  com um ratio \n\nN: P de 1,71. Em cada um dos oito mesocosmos foram analisadas a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de nitritos, \n\nnitratos, am\u00f3nia, fosfatos, silicatos, bem como os ratio associados, e clorofila-a (indicador \n\nda biomassa total do fitopl\u00e2ncton) na coluna de \u00e1gua. Adicionalmente, foi amostrada a \n\nmat\u00e9ria particulada acumulada no interior de armadilhas de sedimento. Neste caso foram \n\nanalisadas a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de carbono total, azoto total, carbono org\u00e2nico particulado, \n\nazoto org\u00e2nico particulado, carbono inorg\u00e2nico particulado, s\u00edlica org\u00e2nica particulada e \n\ns\u00edlica biog\u00eanica. As diferen\u00e7as entre os dois tratamentos experimentais, para todas as \n\nvari\u00e1veis referidas, foram testadas estatisticamente. \n\nOs resultados obtidos n\u00e3o revelaram diferen\u00e7as significativas em nenhuma das vari\u00e1veis \n\nqu\u00edmicas ou biol\u00f3gicas entre os dois tratamentos experimentais. No entanto, observaram-se \n\ndesvios claros nos ratios C: N: P, em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos valores propostos por Redfield (106: 16: 1), \n\npara os nutrientes inorg\u00e2nicos dissolvidos e mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica particulada acumulada nas \n\narmadilhas de sedimento. Hip\u00f3teses para explicar estes desvios foram apresentadas, \n\nincluindo varia\u00e7\u00f5es na composi\u00e7\u00e3o da comunidade de fitopl\u00e2ncton e mixotrofia. Os \n\nresultados indicaram que a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de azoto utilizado n\u00e3o se associou a diferen\u00e7as \n\nsignificativas nas taxas de exporta\u00e7\u00e3o vertical de carbono. No geral, a estrat\u00e9gia \n\nexperimental utilizada apresentou alguns problemas incluindo uma similaridade entre as \n\nduas massas de \u00e1gua amostradas na OMZ e os dist\u00farbios gerados pelas aves marinhas (ex.: \n\nentrada de guano e presas no interior dos mesocosmos). Experi\u00eancias futuras dever\u00e3o \n\nativamente limitar estes problemas.  A informa\u00e7\u00e3o quantitativa sobre a composi\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\ncomunidade fitoplanct\u00f3nica, dispon\u00edvel futuramente (ap\u00f3s a data de submiss\u00e3o desta tese \n\nde mestrado), dever\u00e1 ser utilizada para testar as hip\u00f3teses apresentadas no estudo.  \n\n\n\nXII \n \n\nTable of content \nDECLARATION OF AUTHORSHIP .............................................................................................................

Introduction \n\n1.1 Coastal upwelling ecosystems and Oxygen Minimum Zones \n\nThe eastern boundaries of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are characterized by major coastal \n\nupwelling systems. Prevailing alongshore equatorward wind stress, in combination with \n\nCoriolis deflection due to earth\u00b4s rotation, forces surface water to be driven offshore, which \n\nin turn is replaced by cool, nutrient-rich subsurface upwelled water (Bakun, 1990; Caddy \n\nand Bakun, 1994). These coastal upwelling areas therefore supply essential dissolved \n\ninorganic nutrients and stimulate phytoplankton primary production, which forms the base \n\nof productive food webs, including valuable fishery resources (Bakun, 1990). Coastal \n\nupwelling regions cover only a small fraction (1%) of the global ocean, but contribute \n\ndisproportionally to oceanic productivity, therefore playing an important role in the \n\nbiogeochemical cycling of marine nutrients (Capone and Hutchins, 2013; Hauss, Franz and \n\nSommer, 2012). The Peru current system, flowing northwards off the South American West \n\ncoast, is unequaled among all other upwelling systems in terms of fish biomass and fishery \n\nlandings (Bakun and Weeks, 2008). Biogeochemically, it is also of great importance due to \n\nits intense Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ), with a thickness over 600m at some points \n\n(Daneri et al., 2000; Fuenzalida et al., 2009). OMZs are permanently oxygen deficient waters \n\nthat develop at mid-depths, below surface waters, as a result of poor ventilation, high \n\nsurface primary production and resultant organic matter vertical exportation which is \n\ndecomposed by microbial activity, ultimately consuming oxygen (Fuenzalida et al., 2009; \n\nKalvelage et al., 2013). As anthropogenic disturbances continue to support global warming \n\nand oceanic nutrient input, further decreasing oxygen concentrations in the ocean, OMZs \n\nare predicted to increase both in spatial coverage and intensity (Fuenzalida et al., 2009). \n\n\n\n2 \n \n\nEven though OMZs with oxygen concentrations less than 20 ?mol kg\n-1\n\n occupy only 1% of the \n\nglobal ocean volume, they account for ~20-40% of global oceanic nitrogen loss (Glock et al., \n\n2013; Lam and Kuypers, 2011).  \n\n1.2 Nitrogen cycling in Oxygen Minimum Zones \n\nInorganic nitrogen is essential for phytoplankton growth and often limits marine primary \n\nproductivity, therefore playing a crucial role within marine biogeochemistry (Bohlen et al., \n\n2011; Glock et al., 2013). Bioavailable forms of inorganic nitrogen include nitrate (NO3\n-\n), \n\nnitrite (NO2\n-\n) and ammonium (NH4\n\n+\n), but constitute only 6% of total nitrogen available in \n\nseawater (Bohlen et al., 2011; Gier et al., 2016). A generalization of the marine nitrogen \n\ncycle is depicted in Figure 1.1.  \n\nUnder oxic conditions (>90 ?mol O2 kg\n-1\n\n), present in most parts of the global ocean, oxygen \n\nis the most energetically favourable electron acceptor for the decomposition of organic \n\nmatter (Lam and Kuypers, 2011; Kristensen, 2000). However, in oxygen depleted waters,  \n\nnitrate is the next preferred electron acceptor and used as an oxidant in the degradation of \n\nsinking organic matter, yielding similar amounts of free energy in relation to  oxic microbial \n\nrespiration (Lachkar et al., 2016; Lam and Kuypers, 2011). This dissimilatory reduction of \n\nnitrate in anaerobic respiration converts nitrate, with intermediate products, to dinitrogen \n\ngas (N2), thus resulting in a lower N:P nutrient ratio and therefore a deficit of nitrate relative \n\nto phosphate (Fuenzalida et al., 2009). Increasing denitrification rates, the complete \n\nreduction of nitrate to N2, due to decreasing oxygen concentrations, lead to a lower \n\nnitrogen inventory in the ocean, thus negatively affecting marine productivity. Moreover, \n\ndenitrification is positively linked to nitrous oxide (N2O) production and release to the \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\natmosphere. This in turn will result in higher atmospheric CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O) levels, \n\nfurther supporting the greenhouse effect (Gruber, 2008). \n\nAnaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), based on NO2\n-\n as final electron accepter, is \n\nanother biological process associated to N2 gas production. Anammox is carried out by \n\nchemo-autotrophic bacteria, meaning that the reaction is used as an energy source. In \n\ncontrast to denitrification, anammox is associated to the emission of N2 without the \n\nproduction of intermediate, powerful greenhouse gases (e.g., N2O).  More and more \n\nattention is being attributed to this relatively recently discovered process in the marine \n\nenvironment, as its quantitative significance for the marine nitrogen cycle is not fully known \n\nyet (Brandes et al., 2007; Gruber, 2008). At least one study (Kuypers et al., 2005) has \n\nsuggested that anammox, instead of denitrification, is primarily responsible for the \n\nbiological loss of fixed nitrogen in the OMZ of the Benguela upwelling system. However, it is \n\nimportant to keep in mind that processes supplying the reactants for annamox (or other \n\nreactions in general) may differ in intensity across different environments. Therefore, the \n\ncontribution of anammox to the loss of fixed nitrogen in the Peru upwelling system might be \n\nvery variable (Brandes et al., 2007; Gruber, 2008).   \n\nHeterotrophic denitrification and anammox are the two dominant pathways through which \n\natmospheric N2 is released and reactive nitrogen is lost, thus lowering the inorganic N:P \n\nstoichiometry (Franz et al., 2012b; Glock et al., 2013). Nitrate reduction and dissimilatory \n\nnitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), another nitrate consuming process occurring under \n\nsuboxic and anoxic conditions, have been identified in the Peruvian OMZ, and suggested to \n\nsometimes provide most of the NO2\n-\n and NH4\n\n+\n needed for anammox, respectively (Glock et \n\nal., 2013; Lam et al., 2009). Both heterotrophic and chemolithoautotrophic organisms are \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nable to carry out DNRA (Giblin et al., 2013). DNRA, unlike denitrification and anammox, \n\nconserves reactive N within the ecosystem as ammonium, which may be incorporated by \n\norganisms or oxidized back to nitrate. Most studies on DNRA have been carried out in \n\nsulfide-rich environments, with some of them showing that DNRA can be a major pathway \n\nfor nitrogen (Giblin et al., 2013; Glock et al., 2013; Lam et al., 2009).  \n\nAtmospheric N2 is converted to organic nitrogen by nitrogen fixing bacteria, which are the \n\nonly organisms in the marine realm that can access the large pool of dinitrogen gas (Bohlen \n\net al., 2011; Glock et al., 2013). Marine N2 fixation is mainly associated to photoautotrophic \n\ncyanobacteria (e.g. diazotrophs), and is the most important source of fixed new nitrogen \n\nwhen nitrogen concentrations are exhausted (Gruber, 2008). Fixed organic nitrogen is \n\nmostly remineralized to nitrate by two consecutive processes: ammonification and \n\nnitrification. Firstly, organic nitrogen is converted to NH4\n+\n (ammonification) by heterotrophic \n\nbacteria, mostly. Then nitrifying prokaryotes carry out nitrification, by facilitating the \n\noxidation of NH4\n+\n to NO2\n\n-\n and the oxidation of NO2\n\n-\n to NO3\n\n-\n. It must be noted that \n\nnitrification is an aerobic process. Therefore, the expected expansion of OMZs could inhibit \n\nglobal nitrification rates (Glock et al., 2013; Gruber, 2008). \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1: Schematic representation of the marine nitrogen cycle and its coupling to the marine \n\ncycles of oxygen, phosphorous and carbon. Of particular importance are the processes of nitrogen \n\nfixation and denitrification, which make the fixed nitrogen content of the ocean open to biologically \n\nmediated changes. Note that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) is not included. \n\nExtracted from Gruber (2008). \n\n1.3 Phosphorous cycling in Oxygen Minimum Zones \n\nAnother essential inorganic nutrient for phytoplankton growth and life in general is \n\nphosphorus (P), being an integral part for energy storage and cell structure (Filippelli, 2001; \n\nElser et al., 2007; White and Dyhrman, 2013). P is an essential part of adenosine \n\ntriphosphate (ATP), therefore playing a major role in the transmission of chemical energy. \n\nAdditionally, P is crucial for the structural framework of nucleic acids, including DNA and \n\nRNA (Paytan and McLaughlin, 2007). Thus, in order to determine ecosystem structure and \n\nfunction, the biogeochemical cycling of phosphorus is important and must be addressed \n\n(White and Dyhrman, 2013). An overview of the marine phosphorous cycle is illustrated in \n\nFigure 1.2. Unlike N, there are no organisms that can fix P from the atmosphere. Therefore, \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nP is often the limiting macronutrient for primary production over geological time scales \n\n(Paytan and McLaughlin, 2007). Like N, P partly governs the velocity at which atmospheric \n\nCO2 is taken up and converted to organic matter, therefore influencing the marine carbon \n\ncycle (F\u00f6llmi, 1996; Paytan and McLaughlin, 2007). Distribution patterns and processes of \n\ndissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) have been studied more intensively than those of \n\ndissolved organic phosphorus (DOP). However, relatively recent studies revealed the \n\nimportance of DOP as a phosphorus source for marine primary producers. In surface waters \n\nof coastal marine systems, DOP represents a major part of dissolved phosphorus and can \n\ncomprise up to ~90% of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) (Ruttenberg and Dyhrman, 2012; \n\nWhite and Dyhrman, 2013). DOP is converted to bioavailable DIP through the enzymatic \n\nhydrolysis of organic substrates, by alkaline phosphatase and C-P lyase (Ruttenberg and \n\nDyhrman, 2012). Ruttenberg and Dyhrman (2012) showed how changes in inorganic N:P \n\nratios affect DOP production in coastal upwelling areas, by taking advantage of the fact that \n\nlow concentrations of DIP induce the activity of alkaline phosphatase, thereby increasing the \n\nDIP concentration by converting DOP to DIP. \n\nThe dominant input of phosphorus to the oceans is associated to continental weathering. \n\nMuch of this input is retained within continental shelve sediments, as particulate \n\nphosphorus (Froelich et al., 1982; Paytan and McLaughlin, 2007). Within sediments, P is \n\npresent as organic and inorganic forms. The fraction of organic P is very small compared to \n\nthe bulk sediment weight, and usually is much less concentrated than DIP. Inorganic forms \n\nare iron and \u2013calcium-bound and exhibit particular sensitivity to variations in the redox \n\npotential. Iron-bound P usually occurs in oxic surface sediments, while anoxic sediments are \n\nmore abundant in calcium-bound P (Gomez et al., 1999; Paytan and McLaughlin, 2007). \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nAfter burial, iron dissolution, phosphate release and the precipitation of apatite \n\n(phosphorus rich mineral) may occur through various biotic and abiotic processes (White \n\nand Dyhrman, 2013). Generally, phosphorite deposits are interpreted as proxies for periods \n\nand/or locations of high biological production, as well as low oxygen concentration at the \n\nsediment-water interface, not only for geological records but also for modern day deposits. \n\nThese phosphorite deposits have been identified at the continental margins of some of the \n\nmajor upwelling areas, including the Peru upwelling system (Paytan and McLaughlin, 2007). \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2: Schematic representation of the marine phosphorus cycle. Fluxes are given in italics. \nContinental weathering is the primary source of phosphorous to the oceanic phosphorous cycle. \nMost of this phosphorous is delivered via rivers, with a smaller portion delivered via dust deposition. \nIn recent times, anthropogenic sources of phosphorous have become a large fraction of the \nphosphorous delivered to the marine environment, effectively doubling the pre-anthropogenic flux. \nThe primary sink for phosphorous in the marine environment is loss to the sediments. Much of the \nparticulate flux from rivers is lost to sediments on the continental shelves, and a smaller portion is \nlost to deep-sea sediments. Extracted from Paytan and McLaughlin (2007). \n\n1.4 Importance of vertical flux and inorganic N:P \n\nThe vertical export of organic material from the surface of the ocean is a key process for the \n\nbiological carbon pump, which is an important component of the global carbon cycle. \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nCarbon, taken up as CO2 and accumulated in phytoplankton cells via photosynthesis, is \n\ntransported to the deep ocean (Le Moigne et al., 2015; Riebesell et al., 2007). Thus, the \n\nvertical flux of phytoplankton cells is to some extent responsible for the ocean\u00b4s ability to \n\nact as a sink for CO2 (Agusti et al., 2015). The vertical export of particulate matter is \n\ndetermined by the decomposition rate and sinking velocity of the sinking material, as well as \n\nactive zooplankton vertical migration (Ar\u00edstegui et al., 2009; Neuer, 2014). Sinking POM is \n\ncomposed of marine snow (i.e. organic aggregates), zooplankton fecal pellets and \n\nphytodetritus (Turner, 2015). Slow sinking particles are eaten or degraded before reaching \n\ngreater depths, as opposed to faster sinking particles, which are likelier to reach the \n\nsediment (Neuer, 2014).  \n\nNutrient and light availability modulate phytoplankton primary production and community \n\ncomposition. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a link between phytoplankton \n\ncommunity composition and export efficiency, in order to understand how changing \n\nenvironments may influence the biological carbon pump (Le Moigne et al., 2015).  \n\nRecently, it has been recognized that the elemental stoichiometry of POM might deviate \n\nfrom the canonical Redfield ratio (Martiny et al., 2014). The composition of C:N:P of POM is \n\ndependent on phytoplankton community composition and physiological state. Therefore, \n\nobserved values and trends of the elemental stoichiometry of sinking POM may be linked, at \n\nleast in part, to phytoplankton assemblages (Quigg et al., 2003). However, it is important to \n\nkeep in mind that during sinking, POM may be subjected to processes that alter C:N:P ratios \n\n(eg. remineralisation) (Deutsch and Weber, 2012; Le Moigne et al., 2015?).  \n\nThese variations in elemental composition of particulate matter may be the result of \n\ndifferent mechanisms (Martiny et al., 2013b). One such mechanism refers to a decreased \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nallocation of N in phytoplankton cells as cells become N-limited, commonly resulting in a \n\nhigher cellular C:N ratio. Another mechanism, whereby elemental ratios of particulate \n\nmatter are influenced, is autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms specifically removing \n\nelements from phytodetritus. Additionally, phytoplankton growing under light limiting \n\nconditions may accumulate less carbon storage polymers, linking this mechanism to a \n\nreduced cellular C:N ratio. Furthermore, another mechanism suggests that different \n\nphytoplankton taxa have unique elemental stoichiometries. The last mechanism refers to \n\nthe specific growth rate strategy (Martiny et al., 2013b). Phytoplankton cells larger than 20 \n\n\u00b5m (microplankton) mainly rely on upwelled nitrate as a nitrogen source, while smaller cells \n\n(pico- and nanoplankton, 0.2 \u2013 20 \u00b5m) are able to use regenerated nutrients (e.g., \n\nammonium), even under limiting nutrient conditions. Moreover, the inorganic N:P ratio \n\nrequirements of phytoplankton also vary across phytoplankton functional ecotypes, and \n\nmay deviate from the canonical Redfield N:P ratio of 16:1  (Franz et al., 2012b; Hauss et al., \n\n2012; Meyer et al., 2016; Redfield, 1958). This behaviour has been suggested to originate in \n\nthe specific growth rate strategy of primary producers, which allows for the broad division \n\nof phytoplankton into two groups, the \u2018bloomers\u2019 and the \u2018survivalists\u2019. \u2018Bloomers\u2019 \n\npredominantly are large-celled phytoplankton (e.g. diatoms and dinoflagellates). Their \n\ncellular entities contain low N:P ratio RNA. On the other hand, \u2018survivalists\u2019, mainly small-\n\ncelled phytoplankton (pico- and nanoplankton), are characterized by a higher cellular N:P \n\nratio (relative to \u2018bloomers\u2019), synthesizing vast amounts of N:P rich proteins(Franz et al., \n\n2012b).  \n\nThe previously mentioned processes and the resulting changes in nutrient stoichiometry \n\nmay lead to variations in the supply of dissolved nutrients to surface waters during \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nupwelling events. Therefore, dissolved inorganic macronutrient composition may affect \n\nphytoplankton communities, which in turn may influence the elemental stoichiometry of \n\nsinking POM (Gervais and Riebesell, 2001; Hauss et al., 2012; Meyer et al., 2016; Sommer et \n\nal., 2004).  \n\nThis study aimed to evaluate the influence of the composition of dissolved inorganic \n\nmacronutrients in upwelled water on the elemental stoichiometry of sinking particulate \n\nmatter off the Peruvian continental shelf.  \n\nThe specific objectives addressed the following questions:  \n\n(1) Are upwelled waters with different dissolved inorganic N:P ratios associated to \n\ndifferences in the elemental stoichiometry of sinking particulate matter? \n\n(2) Are nutrient concentration and uptake related to differences in organic carbon \n\nexport rates? \n\nThis study presents data from a large scale in situ mesocosm experiment, conducted in \n\nPeruvian coastal water from the end of February to the middle of April 2017. Two \n\nexperimental treatments with different dissolved inorganic N:P ratio were established. \n\nIn the eight mesocosms (four replicates per treatment) nitrite, nitrate, ammonium, \n\nphosphate and silicate, Chl a and dissolved inorganic N:P ratio in the water column, as \n\nwell as total particulate carbon and nitrogen, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, \n\nparticulate inorganic carbon, particulate organic phosphorous and biogenic silica in the \n\nsediment traps was assessed and checked for differences between the two experimental \n\ntreatments.  \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n2. Materials and Methods \n\n2.1 Study area \n\nThe Peruvian upwelling region is part of the eastern boundary current of the Eastern \n\nTropical South Pacific (Bohlen et al., 2011). Despite the seasonal and interannual variations \n\nin upwelling intensity, this region is considered as one of the most productive marine \n\necosystems. The distribution of sea surface temperatures (SST) over the region, with a clear \n\ncross-shore gradient and colder temperatures onshore, represents the signature of coastal \n\nupwelling activity (Fig. 2.1A). Upwelled colder nutrient-rich water masses, with high \n\nconcentrations of nitrate, phosphorus and silicate (Capone and Hutchins, 2013), lead to high \n\nlevels of phytoplankton primary productivity, as indicated by high surface chlorophyll a \n\nconcentration over the continental shelf (Fig. 2.1B). The high primary production at the \n\nsurface and the consequent sinking of organic matter accompanied by oxic microbial \n\nrespiration, gives rise to the most intense marine oxygen minimum zone (Gier et al., 2016).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1: Mean distribution of (A) sea surface temperature and (B) surface Chl a concentration \nfor the Peruvian upwelling region (between 5\u00b0N, 23\u00b0S, 100\u00b0W,65\u00b0W), at a 4km spatial resolution, \nduring the period January-April 2010-2014 (approximate experimental period). Data were \nacquired from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite sensor (MODIS-\nAqua) at https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov NASA.

The experiment was conducted from February to April 2017 and the mesocosm \n\nmooring site was located north of Isla San Lorenzo, off the Lima coast (12\u00b0 03.328' S, 077\u00b0 \n\n14.086' W; Fig. 2.2), within the region of maximum primary productivity of the Peruvian \n\nupwelling system (Bohlen et al., 2011; Bruland et al., 2005). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2: Mesocosm mooring site (red circle). Maps were acquired from the Bathymetry Data \nViewer at https://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/ \n\n \n\n2.2.1 Experimental units: Mesocosms \n\nThe in situ mesocosm experiment was based on the mobile sea-going Kiel Off-Shore \n\nMesocosms for Ocean Simulations (KOSMOS) (Fig. 2.3A). This system includes eight \n\nmesocosm units. Each unit consists of a 20m long flexible polyurethane foil bag (2m in \n\nLima \u00ae \n\n \n\nPeru \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\ndiameter, 1mm thick; approximate capacity of 60 m\n3\n), mounted to a metal flotation frame. \n\nAt the bottom, each mesocosm unit is equipped with a sediment trap. The collection \n\ncylinder is connected to a sediment trap funnel to the top. To the bottom, it is connected to \n\na silicon tube, which is attached to the flotation frame above the sea surface. A wire helix \n\nhose covers the first 1.5m of the silicon tube, to prevent current related bending of the tube \n\n(see details in Figure 2.3B). During deployment of the mesocosm units, the bags were sealed \n\nat the bottom and top with a 3mm mesh size net, to exclude large zooplankton and nekton \n\nfrom the experiment. Once lowered in the water column, the mesocosm bags were left \n\nopen for approximately 3 days in order to ensure a complete exchange of the water body, \n\nthus promoting similar starting conditions inside all mesocosm units.  \n\n \nFigure 2.3: (A) Technical drawing of the Kiel Off-Shore Mesocosms for Ocean Simulations floating \nframe with the unfolded thermoplastic polyurethane enclosure bag and attached funnel-shaped \nsediment trap.(B)Sediment trap design and pumping system.

This was done via a pulley construction (Fig. 2.4) by gradually \n\nmoving the spider up and down the entire mesocosm water column, while the salt brine \n\n(solution) was pumped through the \u201cspider\u201d. Salinity measurements were done before and \n\nafter salt brine addition, using a multisensory CTD CTD60M (Sun and Sea Technologies). The \n\nresulting change in salinity, allowed the precise evaluation of mesocosm volume (see Czerny \n\net al. 2013, for a detailed description).  \n\n \n\nFig 2.4: Sketch of the pulley construction used to move \u201cspider\u201d up and down \n\n(left). Dispersion device \u201cspider\u201d (right). Extracted from Riebesell et al., 2013 \n\n \n\n2.2.3 Experimental treatments \n\nTwo experimental treatments, with 4 replicates each, were prepared to test the effects of \n\nN:P nutrient ratios. OMZ influenced water masses, below the surface of the tropical South \n\nEast Pacific, may have a remarkably low N:P ratio (relative to the Redfield ratio). Upwelling \n\non the narrow continental shelf supplies surface waters with these water masses of low N:P \n\nratio. N:P ratios below the Redfield ratio of 16:1 off the Peruvian coast have been identified, \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\nand decreasing N:P ratios may be related to the expansion of OMZs (Franz et al., 2012a; \n\nFranz et al., 2012b).  \n\nOMZ water was collected at two different stations from a depth of approximately 40m, \n\nclose to the seafloor, in the vicinity of the mooring site. After the deployment and closure of \n\nthe eight mesocosms, known volumes (22000 L) of each of the two different OMZ derived \n\nwater masses were added to the 4 replicate mesocosms of each experimental treatment, in \n\norder to stimulate upwelling. Prior to water addition, a slightly lower volume of water was \n\npumped out of the mesocosms. For each mesocosm, OMZ water was added at two depth \n\nlevels, mesocosm surface (0.5-9.0m) and bottom levels (14-17m), on day 12 (after sampling) \n\nand 11, respectively. The properties of the retrieved OMZ water masses are listed in Tables \n\n2 and 3. Mesocosms 1, 4, 5 and 8 were used for the very low N:P treatment, while \n\nmesocosms 2, 3, 6 and 7 were used for the low N:P treatment.  \n\n \n\n2.3 Mesocosm sampling procedure \n\n2.3.1 Water column sampling \n\nWater samples were regularly collected during the experiment, starting after mesocosm \n\nclosure (closure marked day 0). Sampling was undertaken every 48 hours, with the \n\nexception of the periods between days 1-4 and 12-18 where sampling was undertaken every \n\n24 hours, always after sediment sampling. An integrating water sampler (IWS, Hydrobios) \n\nwas used for dissolved inorganic macronutrients (NO3\n-\n, NO2\n\n-\n, NH4\n\n+\n, PO4\n\n3-\n and Si(OH)4\n\n-\n). \n\nSamples were transferred to acid-cleaned (10% HCl) plastic bottles, filtered through \n\ncellulose acetate filters (nominal pore size: 0.45 \u00b5m, GF/F, Whatman) to reduce \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\ncontamination effects, and analysed on the day of sampling. Suspended particulate matter \n\nwas also sampled using integrating water samplers. During sampling, samples were \n\nprotected from direct sunlight and stored in 5L canisters inside cooling boxes. Subsampling \n\nfrom canisters was done after manual homogenization, to ensure no particulate matter was \n\naccumulated at the carboy bottom. Concentration of both dissolved inorganic \n\nmacronutrients and suspended particulate matter represented depth-integrated values for \n\neach mesocosm, since the sampling system allowed constant sampling of the entire water \n\ncolumn, with homogeneous sampling throughout the entire mesocosm depth.  \n\n 2.3.2 Sediment trap sampling \n\nSampling of the material accumulated inside the sediment traps was conducted every 48 \n\nhours, always before water sampling to avoid dispersion of the sediment trap material into \n\nthe water column. The deposited material was (vacuum) pumped through the silicon tube \n\nand collected into 5L Schott Duran\u00ae glass flasks (Fig. 2.3B). At first sign of particles, visually \n\ndetected through the Plexiglas\u00ae pipe, pumping was interrupted and seawater collected into \n\nthe glass flasks was discarded, if clear. The vacuum sampling method was then reapplied. \n\nThis sampling procedure ensured a minimized disturbance of the enclosed water body as \n\nwell as an easy and efficient recovery of sedimented material. To avoid warming and \n\nincreased bacterial degradation of the organic matter, glass flasks were stored inside large \n\nboxes, filled with cooling elements, throughout the sediment sampling and laboratory \n\nprocessing periods.  \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\n2.4 Sample analysis \n\n2.4.1 Dissolved inorganic macronutrients \n\nThe concentration of dissolved NO3\n-\n, NO2\n\n-\n, NH4\n\n+\n, PO4\n\n3-\n, Si(OH)4\n\n-\n, was analysed directly after \n\nIWS sampling, using a SEAL Analytical QuAAtro AutoAnalyzer, connected to JASCO Model \n\nFP-2020 Intelligent Fluorescence Detector and a SEAL Analytical XY2 autosampler. \n\nMeasurement procedures followed methods described by Hydes et al. (2010). For a detailed \n\ndescription of the determination of nitrite and nitrate, ammounium, phosphate and silicate, \n\nsee Morris and Riley (1963), K\u00e9rouel and Aminot (1997), Murphy and Riley (1962) and \n\nMullin and Riley (1965), respectively.  \n\n2.4.2 Suspended particulate matter \n\nSubsamples were taken from the canisters for the analyses of chlorophyll a concentration \n\n(Chl a) and filtered onto combusted glass fibre filters (nominal pore size: 0.7 \u00b5m, 25 mm \n\ndiameter, Whatman), using a gentle vacuum (&lt;200 mbar). Fluorometric determination of \n\nChl a was carried out, using the method developed by Welschmeyer (1994).  \n\n2.4.3 Particulate matter accumulated inside sediment traps \n\nAfter sediment sample collection and transport to laboratory facilities, sample volumes \n\nwere determined gravimetrically. Subsamples (<10% of bulk sample volume) for other \n\nvariables were taken after sample homogenization, by gently shaking the glass flasks. In \n\norder to separate sediment particles from (bulk) seawater, first, precipitation of the \n\nsediment trap particles was achieved by adding 3M FeCl3 and 3M NaOH simultaneously at a \n\nratio of 0,12 ?l : 0,39 ?l per gram of sample weight. The ratio of FeCl3 to NaOH was \n\npreviously determined, by adding increasing amounts of FeCl3 to samples of day 0, until \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nmaximum precipitation with minimal FeCl3 input was visually determined. NaOH was then \n\nadded until the pH values of the samples were close to 8,1 again. After 1 hour of settling \n\ntime, the clear supernatant was carefully removed, using a vacuum pump. The remaining \n\nparticle suspensions inside the 5L sampling flasks were then transferred to 800mL centrifuge \n\nbeakers, and centrifuged for ~10 min at 5236 xg using a 6-16 KS centrifuge (Sigma). To \n\nprevent particle re-suspension, a slow deceleration was applied. After carefully discarding \n\nthe supernatant, the remaining sample pellets were transferred into 110mL centrifuge tubes \n\nand the same procedure was applied until the 5L sampling flasks are empty. The small tubes \n\nwere then centrifuged for ~10 min at 5039 xg, using a 3K12 centrifuge (Sigma) and after \n\ndiscarding the supernatant, the sediment pellets were immediately frozen at -20\u00b0C, inside \n\nplastic screw cap cups. Freeze-drying the sediment pellet samples for up to 72 hours \n\nremoved the remaining water. Once all the water has been removed, sample pellets were \n\nenclosed inside a hollow sphere of 4VA steel, deep-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground \n\ninto a homogeneous fine powder using the ball-mill developed by Boxhammer et al. (2015). \n\nThe steps involved from sediment sample collection to grinding are summarized in Figure \n\n2.5. For more details see Boxhammer et al. (2015).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5: Protocol for mesocosm sediment trap sampling (1), particle concentration (2-3), freeze-\n\ndrying (4) and grinding (5-8) to convert heterogeneous sediment trap samples into homogeneous \n\npowder for biogeochemical analysis. Adapted from Boxhammer et al. (2015). \n\n \n\nSubsamples of the sediment pellet powder were used to determine the concentration of \n\ntotal particulate carbon (TPCSED), nitrogen (TPNSED), particulate organic phosphorous \n\n(POPSED), biogenic silicate (BSiSED), particulate organic carbon (POCSED) and nitrogen (PONSED). \n\nTwo mg subsamples were transferred into tin cups and TPCSED, TPNSED, POCSED and PONSED \n\nwas measured using an elemental analyser (Euro EA-CN, Hekatech), calibrated with \n\nacetanilide (C8H9NO) and soil standard (Hekatech, catalogue number HE33860101). PICSED \n\nwas calculated by subtracting POCSED from TPCSED.  \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\nFor POPSED analysis, two mg subsamples were placed into 40 mL glass vials, containing a \n\n40mL solution of deionized water and an oxidizing decomposition reagent (Merck, catalogue \n\nno. 112936). Particulate organic phosphorous was oxidized to orthophosphate by \n\nautoclaving at 121\no\nC for 30 minutes in a pressure cooker. After sample cooling, a \n\nspectrophotometric analysis, similar to the method of Hansen and Koroleff (1999) for \n\ndissolved inorganic phosphorous, was used to determine POPSED concentrations.  \n\nBSiSED from the sediment pellet powder was leached by alkaline pulping with 0.1 M NaOH at \n\n85\u00b0C for 135 minutes. Adding 0.05 M H2SO4 terminated the leaching process, after which a \n\nspectrophotometric analysis similar to Hansen and Koroleff (1999) was used for the \n\ndetermination of BSiSED concentrations. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.5 Statistical analysis \n\nThe effects of nutrient ratio on the elemental stoichiometry of sinking particulate matter \n\nwere tested using the Student\u00b4s t-test. Similarly, the effects of nutrient uptake on POC \n\nexport rates to the sediment traps were also tested using the Student\u00b4s t-test. An F-test two \n\nsample for variances was used to assess homogeneity of variance.

These fluxes became slightly \n\nhigher in the low N:P treatment starting on day 26. Similarly, cumulative POP sediment trap \n\nfluxes over time increased gradually for the first 40 days in both treatments, but the \n\naccumulation rate increased substantially from day 40 onwards (Fig. 3.6). Opposite to that, \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\nthere was a more intense increase for the initial 18 days in cumulative BSi sediment trap \n\nfluxes in both treatments, while accumulation ceased thereafter (Fig. 3.6). Additionally, \n\nonce the accumulation declined after day 18, fluxes in the low N:P treatment were slightly \n\nhigher, compared to the very low N:P treatment. No statistically significant differences \n\nbetween treatments for any of the parameters were found (Table 3.2).  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFigure 3.6: Mean cumulative particulate matter collected in the sediment traps (n=4).

Even though more DIN was \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\nused under the low N:P mesocosms compared to the very low N:P mesocosms (appendix \n\nTable 6.2), POC export per utilized N in the water column was lower (Fig. 3.7).

Discussion \n\nSince there have been no statistically significant differences in any of the parameters \n\nbetween the two experimental treatments, this discussion will mainly focus on the observed \n\ntrends of the treatments over time. Furthermore, possible explanations as to why there \n\nhave not been any statistically significant differences between the treatments will be \n\ndiscussed.  \n\n4.1 How accurate was upwelling simulation? \n\nSimulated upwelling using water masses with different dissolved inorganic N:P ratios did not \n\nlead to changes in the elemental stoichiometry of sinking particulate matter (Table. 1). This \n\nis likely due to the fact, that the dissolved inorganic N:P ratio in the mesocosms, throughout \n\nthe entire experimental period, also did not differ significantly, even though the OMZ water \n\nadded to the low N:P mesocosms showed a dissolved inorganic N:P ratio 15-fold higher than \n\nthe very low N:P treatment (Table 3.1). The proportion of dissolved inorganic N to P in \n\nseawater may promote particular plankton communities, with certain biogeochemical \n\nconsequences, based on the species specific metabolic requirements (Deutsch and Weber, \n\n2012). Both treatments reached close to zero values in these dissolved inorganic nutrient \n\nproportions shortly after OMZ water additions, most likely due to phytoplankton removing \n\nreactive N from the water. This finding is supported by decreasing concentrations of NO3\n-\n \n\n(and NO2\n-\n) after OMZ water additions (Fig. 3.1), probably making N the limiting nutrient for \n\nphytoplankton growth, since P in the mesocosms was available in high concentrations \n\nthroughout the entire experiment. DIN concentrations below 1 ?M and dissolved inorganic \n\nN:P ratios below 10 have been attributed to nitrogen limitation (Dortch and Whitledge, \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\n1992). However, it has been shown that in situ concentrations and ratios of nutrients may \n\nnot suffice in evaluating the occurrence of nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth \n\n(Domingues et al., 2017). \n\nIt is important to not only look at nutrient stoichiometry but also address absolute \n\nconcentrations of nutrients, especially in the OMZ derived water masses. Nutrient \n\nconcentration also influences plankton community composition, since small phytoplankton \n\ntaxa may outcompete larger cells under nutrient scarce conditions (Franz et al., 2012b). The \n\nobserved concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen species in the retrieved OMZ water \n\nmasses, especially nitrate, were much lower than expected, even for an OMZ influenced \n\nupwelling event (appendix Table 6.1). Indeed, Franz et al. (2012b) reported nitrate \n\nconcentrations over 25 ?mol L\n-1\n\n over the shallow Peruvian coastal waters (<100m). \n\nHowever, the added water masses in this experiment were retrieved very close to the \n\nseafloor. Therefore, dissolved inorganic N concentrations of the collected water masses may \n\nalso have been reduced due to the coupling between sediments and overlying water. \n\nSediments can act as sources or sinks for nutrients, and biogeochemical processes occurring \n\nwithin the sediment and the pelagic zone are closely coupled (McGlathery et al., 2004). \n\nNutrient fluxes at the sediment-water interface in coastal oceans are important processes \n\naffecting the chemical composition of the overlying water, ultimately influencing primary \n\nproductivity (Callender and Hammond, 1982). Variations in physical-chemical factors and \n\nhydrodynamic disturbances may lead to a release of nutrients from the sediment to the \n\noverlying water (Yang et al., 2017). Dissolved inorganic N:P ratios lower than the Redfield \n\nratio of 16:1 (Redfield, 1958) have been reported in coastal waters of the Eastern Tropical \n\nNorth Atlantic as a result of benthic N-loss to and P release from the sediment (Meyer et al., \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\n2016). Furthermore, chemical nutrient conditions of the two OMZ water masses mostly \n\nwere very similar to each other (Table 3.1 and 3). This may largely explain why the \n\ntreatments were not significantly different from one another.   \n\nAs can be seen in Figure 15 (appendix), dissolved oxygen concentration inside all \n\nmesocosms decreased rapidly with depth below 5m, but oxic conditions were observed for \n\nmost of the water column. Decreasing oxygen concentrations have been correlated with \n\nincreasing denitrification rates (Gruber, 2008), a process commonly associated with nitrogen \n\nlosses in OMZs. However, low concentrations of NO3\n-\n and NH4\n\n+\n may indicate anammox \n\nactivity in suboxic waters (Arrigo, 2005), a process related to nitrogen loss over the \n\nBenguela OMZ (Kuypers et al., 2005).  \n\n \n\n4.2 Water column properties \n\nIn order to ensure optimal starting conditions for the experiment, similarity in chemical and \n\nbiological conditions between mesocosm bags after closure is desired (Riebesell et al., \n\n2013). However, initial concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients varied across \n\nmesocosms, especially for NO2\n-\n and NH4\n\n+\n (appendix Table 6.3). It is notable that lowest \n\nvalues for all variables were observed in mesocosm 4 (M4). This information can be used to \n\nexplain the remarkably different behaviour of M4 during parts of the experimental period, \n\nfor some variables (see below).  \n\nChl a ranged between 3.0 and 7.0 ?g L\n-1\n\n for the first 40 days of the experiment, in both \n\ntreatments, despite the depletion in all dissolved inorganic nitrogen species after day 18. \n\nTherefore, since Chl a did not decrease, phytoplankton biomass was probably supported by \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\nother sources, including remineralized PON/DON or direct DON uptake. Remineralisation of \n\nPON and DON increases the concentration of dissolved inorganic nutrients (Gruber, 2008), \n\nbut no visible subsequent increase in any of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen species was \n\nobserved immediately after their depletion (Fig. 3.1). This fact could reflect a fast \n\nincorporation of remineralized N by phytoplankton, as soon as it was made available. The \n\nrelatively low sampling frequency, with a long 48h period between successive sampling \n\nstages, only allowed a glimpse of the \u201cbigger picture\u201d, not evaluating short-term processes \n\nof nutrient production and use. Additionally, it has been hypothesized that excess \n\nphosphate favours increased rates of N2-fixation by diazotrophs (Deutsch et al., 2007; \n\nMeyer et al., 2016). Phosphate has been present for the whole course of the experiment \n\n(Fig. 3.1), but data on organic nitrogen in the water column is needed, in order to make \n\nmore accurate inferences. Microzooplankton as consumers of phytoplankton (mostly \n\nprotists), may have also had a relevant role in remineralization processes, through excretion \n\nof inorganic nutrients and introduction of fecal pellets into the POM pool (Calbet and \n\nLandry, 2004; Turner, 2015). Enhanced remineralization of phosphate and ammonium has \n\nbeen observed in the presence of microzooplankton (Le Moigne et al., 2013).   \n\nPrevious studies have shown that DON compounds (e.g., urea), that usually represent the \n\nlargest pool of bioavailable N in most aquatic systems (Bronk et al., 2007), can be a viable \n\ndirect source of reactive N to phytoplankton, particularly when competing for limited \n\ndissolved inorganic N with heterotrophic prokaryotes (Berman et al., 1999; Bradley et al., \n\n2010; Bronk et al., 2007). Furthermore, it is likely that the phytoplankton assemblage in the \n\nsecond half of the experiment was dominated by organisms other than diatoms, since BSiSED \n\nfluxes were almost non-existent.  \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\nThe direct ingestion of living prey by mixotrophic phytoplankton could also explain the \n\ncontinuous increase in Chl a during the second half of the experiment, under reduced \n\nnutrient conditions. According to the review of Stoecker et al. (2017), mixotrophic \n\nphytoplankton, including dinoflagellates and nanoflagellates, are ubiquitous in coastal \n\noceans and are associated with upwelling zones. For these phagotrophic organisms, \n\ndissolved inorganic nutrient acquisition is supplemented or substituted by the ingestion of \n\nprey. Additionally, mixotrophy may also stimulate vertical carbon export through a more \n\nefficient transfer of organic matter into larger plankton, ultimately improving the efficiency \n\nof the biological carbon pump (Hammer and Pitchford, 2006; Stoecker et al., 2017). \n\n \n\n4.3 Elemental stoichiometry of sinking particulate matter \n\nThe proportion of particulate organic carbon to nitrogen (C:N ratio) is of fundamental \n\nimportance in ocean biogeochemistry, as it relates to the efficiency of carbon sequestration, \n\nsecondary production and the biological pump. It also holds valuable information for the \n\ncoupling between the carbon and nitrogen cycles (Martiny et al., 2013a and b; Sterner et al., \n\n2008).  \n\nC:N ratios were higher than the Redfield ratio (6.6) for almost the entire experimental \n\nperiod (Fig. 3.5). N limitation and lower dissolved N:P ratios have been linked with high \n\nparticulate C:N ratios (Martiny et al., 2013b). Since N concentrations in the added water \n\nmasses in this study were remarkably low for an upwelling event (Franz et al., 2012b), \n\nleading to dissolved N:P ratios well below the Redfield ratio, the observed C:N ratio in the \n\nsinking particulate matter may be attributed to N limitation, ultimately resulting in a lower \n\nnitrogen cell quota for phytoplankton (Martiny et al., 2013b). C:N ratios gradually \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\ndecreased, reaching values close to or below the Redfield ratio as the end of the experiment \n\napproached (Fig. 3.5), even though DIN concentrations only increased slightly (Fig. 3.1). \n\nAdditionally, phytoplankton growing under light limitation may accumulate less carbon \n\nstorage polymers (Martiny et al., 2013b), therefore resulting in a decreased cellular C:N \n\nratio. Biological matter that settled on the outside wall of the mesocosm bags was cleaned \n\nregularly, to a depth of approximately 6m. Below that, no cleaning was carried out. Thus, \n\nPAR intensity inside the mesocosms showed a substantial decline below 6 m depth level, \n\neventually leading to increased light limitation (appendix Fig. 6.1 top). It could be argued \n\nthat this gradual decrease of light availability is linked to the relatively constant decrease of \n\nC:N, as phytoplankton during the experiment accumulated less and less carbon storage \n\npolymers over time.  \n\nPIC:POC ratios, often used as a measure of carbon export (Gerecht et al., 2014), stayed \n\nrelatively constant for the entire experimental period. Decreased PIC:POC ratios are linked \n\nto a higher potential for oceanic CO2 uptake and, therefore, a higher drawdown of \n\natmospheric CO2 on longer time scales (Fielding, 2014; Gerecht et al., 2014). The PIC:POC \n\nratios observed in this study were very low, staying&lt;0.08 at all times (Findlay et al., 2011; \n\nGerecht et al., 2014). Calcifying phytoplankton (e.g., coccolithophores) fix HCO3\n-\n into PIC \n\nthrough calcification (i.e., production of calcium carbonate cocccoliths), and into POC \n\nthrough photosynthesis (Bach, 2015; Gerecht et al., 2014; Monteiro et al., 2016). Thus, since \n\nPICSED concentrations were also low (Fig. 3.4), the impact of calcifying organisms on the CO2 \n\nfixation to POC was probably reduced in this study. \n\nBoth C:P and N:P ratios were well below the Redfield ratios throughout most of the \n\nexperimental period (Fig. 3.5). According to Arrigo (2005), the cellular C:P and N:P ratios of \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\neukaryotic phytoplankton vary markedly between the green and red plastid superfamilies. \n\nThe red superfamily (ca. C:P =70,  N:P = 10) usually exhibits significantly lower ratios than \n\nthe green superfamily (C:P ~200, N:P ~27). Thus, it can be argued that the observed ratios \n\nare the result of phytoplankton assemblages mainly composed by representatives of the red \n\nplastid superfamily. Diatoms are included in the red superfamily (Quigg et al., 2003), and the \n\nBSiSED concentrations during the first half of the experiment inside the sediment traps, \n\nsupport their presence (Nelson et al., 1995). C:P and N:P lower than Redfield ratios, as \n\nobserved in this study, have been measured for diatoms (Martiny et al., 2013a). The \n\nremarkably low values for the last ~ten days of the experiment probably reflected the steep \n\nincrease in POPSED during this period (Fig. 3.4). An increase in POP of such magnitude is \n\nunexpected and was likely the result of guano deposition by seabirds. Seabird guano, rich in \n\nnitrogen and phosphorous, is associated with enhanced phytoplankton productivity and \n\nmay alter species composition of the phytoplankton community (Bosman and Hockey, 1986; \n\nShatova et al., 2017; Wootton, 1991). Deposition of seabird guano in the Bering Sea was \n\nassociated with tenfold increases in the uptake of mineral and organic compounds by \n\nphytoplankton, as well as peaks in phytoplankton biomass (Wainright et al., 1998). Thus, the \n\nremarkably low C:P and N:P ratios in the sediment traps at the end of the experiment may \n\nbe due to increased phytoplankton biomass. This statement was supported by a steep rise \n\nin Chl a during the later stage of the experiment. Furthermore, increasing POC and PON \n\nfluxes into the sediment traps from day 40 onwards also supported this (Fig. 3.4). Seabirds, \n\nparticularly inca terns (Larosterna inca), were increasingly sighted, sitting on the metal rings \n\nand cleats of the mesocosms over the last two weeks of the experiment. We have also \n\nobserved guano input by inca terns many times. In addition, an increased occurrence of \n\nlarge fish (>10cm) inside the sediment traps was observed from day 34 onwards. Since we \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\nhave also seen some inca terns dropping their prey into the mesocosms, this increased \n\nobservation of fish within the sediment trap material coincided with increased sightings of \n\nseabirds on the mesocosms. Fish and fish remains (e.g., bones) were removed from the \n\nsediment trap samples to the best of our ability. Whenever there were indications of fish \n\ncontamination of sediment trap material, the entire material was filtered through a mesh \n\n(2mm mesh size), and fish remains were carefully picked out and washed with filtered \n\nseawater (0.2?m), in order to minimize sample loss, while maximizing fish removal. \n\nTherefore, the increase in particulate matter for the last 10 days was probably associated \n\nwith the fertilization of mesocosms with guano, and the subsequent stimulation of \n\nphytoplankton net growth rate. Efforts to deter seabirds were increased, once they became \n\nmore abundant, but no satisfying result was achieved as birds kept on coming back to the \n\nmesocosms.   \n\n \n\n4.4 Vertical export \n\nAn inverse relationship between export efficiency and primary production (PP) has been \n\nobserved in multiple studies (Le Moigne et al., 2016; Maiti et al., 2013). If we assume that \n\nutilized N is an indicator of total PP, PP was higher in the low N:P mesocosms. M4 showed \n\nthe lowest Chl a for most of the experimental period, supporting this statement (appendix \n\nFig. 6.2). Furthermore, less dissolved inorganic N was apparently used inside M4 (Table 6.2). \n\nTherefore, the export efficiency inside M4 was probably higher, in respect to other \n\nmesocosms. Potential hypothesis explaining this unexpected relationship include intense \n\nsurface microbial recycling in high PP areas and grazing-mediated export that varies \n\ninversely with PP (Le Moigne et al., 2016). However, caution is advised when comparing \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nthose findings with results of this study, since these studies have been carried out in the \n\nSouthern Ocean.  \n\nCumulative fluxes of TPC, TPN, POC, PON and BSi into the sediment traps were almost \n\nalways higher under the low N:P treatment, especially in the second half of the experiment \n\n(Fig. 3.6). Even though not significant, this pattern agreed with previous studies that report \n\nan increased exportation when nutrient availability and PP are higher (Le Moigne et al., \n\n2016; Haskell, 2015). Since slightly more nutrients (nitrogen in particular) were available and \n\napparently utilized under the low N:P treatment (Table 6.2 and Fig. 3.1), the slightly higher \n\ncumulative fluxes of TPC, TPN, POC, PON and BSi into the sediment traps are justified. \n\nHigher accumulation rates in cumulative BSiSED fluxes during the beginning of the \n\nexperiment (Fig. 3.6) were associated with greater BSiSED fluxes at the same time (Fig. 3.4), \n\nprobably a result of diatom blooms, until dissolved inorganic nitrogen became depleted (Fig. \n\n3.1). Organisms other than diatoms, such as choanoflagellates and radiolaria, may also have \n\ncontributed to BSiSED fluxes by undergoing biosilicification (Marron et al., 2013). The future \n\nevaluation of plankton composition will allow their quantification, if relevant. \n\n \n\n4.5 Conclusions and outlook \n\nIn this study, water masses with different dissolved inorganic N:P ratios, associated with \n\nOMZ influenced upwelling events, were not associated with differences in the elemental \n\nstoichiometry of sinking particulate matter. Furthermore, apparent nutrient uptake was not \n\nrelated to differences in POC exportation rates. Our results showed clear deviations from \n\nthe canonical Redfield ratio in sinking POM, hypothesized to be related with phytoplankton \n\ncommunity composition. Quantitative data on phytoplankton composition, which will be \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\nmade available in the next months (after the deadline of this master thesis), should be used \n\nfor testing this hypothesis. Sinking POM is partly composed of zooplankton fecal pellets and \n\nthe vertical export of particulate matter is, to some extent, influenced by active zooplankton \n\nmigration. Therefore, the influence of zooplankton on elemental stoichiometries of sinking \n\nparticulate matter should be further considered.  \n\nFurthermore, the potential importance of DON as source of N for phytoplankton, as well as \n\nthe ingestion of living prey, must be assessed. Thus, once community data is available, the \n\noccurrence of mixotrophic phytoplankton taxa should be specifically evaluated. Additionally, \n\nDON concentrations could help to shed light on the nutritional source for phytoplankton \n\n(DON data will also only be made available after the deadline of this thesis). \n\nPotential issues during this experimental study included seabird disturbances (e.g., guano \n\nand prey input). In regions with high seabird abundances, a more effective strategy to deter \n\nseabirds from the mesocosms should be applied, such as spanning a thin net layer between \n\nthe mesocosm roof and metal rings. Since this would greatly impede and slow down \n\nsampling procedures, such a net should be limited to sites of the mesocosms where no \n\nsampling is carried out. Furthermore, the net should be thin, with a relatively large mesh \n\nsize, in order to minimize its impact on PAR entering the mesocosms. Since the two added \n\nOMZ derived water masses were remarkably similar to each other, also chemical and \n\nbiological parameters throughout the experiment were relatively similar to each other. A \n\nsecond OMZ water collection and addition was planned to be carried out, but could not be \n\nrealized, due to technical difficulties.  \n\nThe ocean\u00b4s ability to transfer carbon away from the surface to the deep ocean is of \n\nfundamental importance in reducing CO2 in the atmosphere, without which, accelerated \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\natmospheric CO2 growth would be observed, since more anthropogenic CO2 would remain \n\nin the atmosphere (Le Moigne et al., 2013; Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al., 2010). Therefore, \n\nbiogeochemical processes that alter carbon export or elemental stoichiometries are \n\nimportant aspects in changing ocean environments and must be discussed, in order to \n\nunderstand the coupling between these processes.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\n5.
