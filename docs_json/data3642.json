It happens because the ship operations have a huge demand variation, to reduce the\nship emissions is required an intelligent operation of the generators. This work aims at\nintegrating advanced storage systems to the diesel generators operation. The variation\nof the operation point has a direct interference on the emissions and on the diesel con-\nsumption, this variation is allowed through the frequency and voltage control. The use of\nlithium batteries for various operation points of the generators is analysed. The mainly\nresult obtained was the reduction on diesel consumption and on ??2 emissions when the\ndiesel generators operate for a long time closer to their nominal power. The results of\nthis work can also be applied to isolated power systems equipped with advanced storage\nsystems and diesel generators.\n\nKeywords: Isolated Power Systems, ??2 emission, Advanced Energy Storage Systems,\nFrequency and Voltage Control.\n\n\n\n\n\nList of Figures\n\nFigure 1 ? ?? limits according to Marpol Annex VI. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26\n\nFigure 2 Power and discharging time characteristic of electrical energy storage\ntechnologies. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30\n\nFigure 3 Battery electrical model ???? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32\nFigure 4 Battery electrical model modified Thevenin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33\nFigure 5 Battery electrical model Thevenin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33\nFigure 6 Battery electrical model RC network . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 34\n\nFigure 7 Platform Supply Vessel Power System. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37\nFigure 8 Mechanical Governor. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40\nFigure 9 Hydraulic Governor. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 41\nFigure 10 Electronic Governor. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 42\nFigure 11 Governor-Droop Control. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 43\nFigure 12 Governor-Isochronous Control. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 43\nFigure 13 Matlab Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 45\nFigure 14 MVDC Topology. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 46\nFigure 15 Simplified Single Line diagram of a MVAC electrical distribution. . . . 47\nFigure 16 Single-line diagram of proposed hybrid MVAC/MVDC electrical distri-\n\nbution system. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 47\nFigure 17 Schematic of the induction motor control by using DTC. . . . . . . . . 49\nFigure 18 Matlab Propulsion Control. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 51\nFigure 19 DTC\u2019s Rotor Speed results for 800kW and 910kW bow thruster and\n\n2MW azimuth thruster. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 51\nFigure 20 Results for 800kW and 910kW bow thrusters:(a)DTC\u2019s torque; (b)DTC\u2019s\n\nactive power; (c)DTC\u2019s flux;(d)DTC\u2019s reactive power. . . . . . . . . . . 52\nFigure 21 Results for 2MW azimuth thruster:(a)DTC\u2019s torque; (b)DTC\u2019s active\n\npower; (c)DTC\u2019s flux;(d)DTC\u2019s reactive power. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 53\n\n\n\nFigure 22 Percentage of time for each operation of the PSV routine. . . . . . . . 58\nFigure 23 Power Routine. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 59\nFigure 24 Platform Supply Vessel Power System. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 60\nFigure 25 Diesel Consumption Curve . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 61\nFigure 26 Active power , state of charge and frequency results for opened and\n\nclosed bus-tie for droop and isochronous mode.

A hybrid powertrain is a result of a\nbattery connection to a IPS both power systems, IPS and hybrid, are described in this\nwork. A battery connection enables the operation of the diesel engines at an optimal\npoint, in an optimal point the diesel consumption is lower therefore the GHG emissions\nare also lower. We perform simulations over a standard routine to analyse voltage and\nfrequency levels, moreover we perform analysis over the diesel consumption and the GHG\nemissions.\n\n1.1 Ship Emission Regulation\n\nThis sections aims at clarifying the aspects of the recent regulations that were de-\nveloped to stablish limits on GHG emissions, the three mainly gases (??2, ? ??, ???)\nemitted are discussed. The Paris protocol established guidelines and targets that should\nbe followed by the signatory countries to keep the temperatures limited at 2 ?C above\npre-industrial temperatures. The demand of the ??2 emission reduction began with the\nrecent discussions over the climate crisis. The fifth assessment report of the International\nPanel on Climate Change (IPCC) reinforces that to reduce the risk of irreversible changes\nin the climate system, the global temperature must be limited at 2 ?C above pre-industrial\ntemperatures. To reach this maximum temperature increase, a total of 176 countries have\nsigned and ratified the Paris protocol, unfortunately the advances obtained with the Paris\nprotocol are not applied to ships, which are responsible for 2.5% of global greenhouse gases\n(GHG) emissions. If the shipping emissions are left unregulated, these emissions can reach\n17% of global ??2 emissions, in 2050.\n\nAn recent study from the european parliament shows that to stay below the 2 ?C\nthe shipping emissions should be -13% and -63% of the 2005 ??2 emissions in 2030\nand 2050, respectively. The global GHG emissions increased 25% from 1990 to 2010\n\n\n\n24 Chapter 1. Introduction\n\nwhereas maritime transport increased 70% during the same period. On average this\nGHG emissions rose by 3% per year between 1990 to 2010, global GHG emissions, during\nthe same period, only rose by 1.1%, as can be seen on[1].\n\nThe European regulation has been more restrict, in the recent years, with GHG and\n??2 emissions on Emission Control Areas from large ships navigating into EU ports.\nAccording to [2], the current global limit for sulphur content on fuel oil used in ships is\n3.5% m/m (mass by mass), the new global limit is 0.5% m/m and it will be applied from\n1 January 2020. This limit does not change the limit imposed to Emission Control Areas\n(ECAs) that is 0.1% m/m and is in force since January 2015. Fig.1 shows the ? ?? limits\nfor each Tier according to the Rated Engine Speed. Tier I standard entered into force\nin 2000, Tier II in 2011 and Tier III in 2016. According to [3], Tier I and II limits are\nglobal, whereas ? ?? Emission Control Areas are covered by Tier III standard.\n\nThe main motivations to study ways to solve the ship emissions growth are the recent\nregulation created by the european parliament [4], the growth forecast on ship emissions\nby 2050 [5] and the increasing on media coverage on the topic [6, 7, 8, 9]. The increase\nof power density on lithium ion batteries opened markets for high power application [10],\non the top of that the prices have fallen rapidly in recent years [11, 12].\n\nThe battery connection to the system, making it hybrid, will help the diesel generators\nto operate at their optimal points, it will save diesel and reduce the ??2 emission. It is\npossible to operate at the optimal point in a hybrid system because the battery can work\nas a load when there is a power surplus and as a generator when there is a lack of load.\nThis chapter aims to sintetize the rules and regulations that are in force in a document.\nIn the recent years the ship\u2019s emission has been more studied and some organizations\nhave discussed and created regulations that aims to reduce the GHG emissions.\n\nOne possibility to reduce the ??2 emission can be achieved by using advanced en-\nergy storage system. Its use should not have negative impact on the vessel\u2019s power\nquality and reliability. The main objective of this work is to evaluate the impact on\nthe frequency and the voltage levels of a platform supply vessel (PSV) during a mis-\nsion. To deal with that, we have developed models to perform dynamic simulations using\n???? ???????????/? ?????.\n\n1.1.1 Sulphur Oxides (???)\n\nAccording to [2], sulphur oxides or (???) are formed in the engine, during combustion\nprocess, as a result of the existence of sulphur in the marine fuel. ??? are present on\nthe smoke emitted by the combustion of marine fuel, the sulphuric acid is formed by the\noxidisation of the smoke in the presence of ? ?2, that works as a catalyst, the sulphuric\nacid is one of the major causes of the acid rain. Nowadays, according to the MARPOL\nAnnex VI, the global limit for sulphur content in marine fuels is 3.50% m/m (mass by\nmass) it will be reduced to 0.50% m/m, effective from 1 January 2020 [13, 14]. This limit\n\n\n\n1.1. Ship Emission Regulation 25\n\ndoes not change the limits of ??? and particulate matter imposed to Emission Control\nAreas (ECAs) that is 0.1% m/m and is in force since January 2015. There are four\nexisting ECAs: the North Sea, the US Caribbean ECA, the Baltic Sea and the Emission\nControl Area that includes most of US and Canadian coast, called as North American\nECA. The mainly methods to reduce the emission of (???) are: use of fuels with low\nsulphur, apply a scrubbing liquid to the exhaust gas reducing the ??? to 95%, finally a\ngood quality cylinder lubrication also achieves a ??? emission reduction [15, 16].\n\n1.1.2 Nitrogen Oxides (? ??)\n\nAccording to [17], Nitrogen represents 78% of the air mixture, whereas the oxygen\nrepresents 21%. At certain operation conditions, this air mixture, inside a marine engine,\ncan form Nitrogen Oxides, (? ??) are produced by the reaction between the nitrogen and\nthe oxygen , because of the operating conditions is said that this reaction is dependent on\npeak temperatures and high pressure in the engine cylinders - above 1200?C the formation\nis significant and above 1500?C it becomes rapid. Whereas in [18] is shown the mainly\ncauses to form ? ?? in Marine Engines.\n\nSome methods to reduce the emission of (? ??) are following mentioned,mixing humid\nair to the combustion air before it goes to the cylinder can achieve a reduction by 70-80%\nof ? ??, as the technique mentioned before another technique mixes the combustion air\nto the gases exhausted by the engine, reducing the amount of oxygen presented on the\ncombustion chamber therefore reducing the formation of ? ??, the next approach aims at\nusing water to reduce the combustion temperature, since when the combustion happen\nat high temperatures the formation of ? ??

The next section adds\nmore motivations of this project.\n\n1.2 Motivation\n\nThe recent regulation created by the european parliament [4], the growth forecast on\nship emissions by 2050 [5],the increasing media coverage on the topic [6, 7, 19, 20] are the\nmainly motivations to study ways to solve the challenge of ship emissions growth. The\nincrease of power density on lithium ion batteries opened markets on which the batteries\ncan operate at much higher power[10, 21], besides the fact that increasing on the power\ndensity, the prices of the lithium ion batteries have fallen in the recent years[11, 22].\n\n1.3 Objective\n\nThe objective of this research is to analyze the impact of operating an advanced\nstorage system in combination with diesel generators, as the demand of the ship has a\nhuge variation, the battery can be used to keep the generators operating closer to their\nmaximum nominal power. This additional ability would reduce the diesel consumption\nand reduce the CO2 emission. Besides that, the impact of the use of the advanced\nstorage system in the reliability is also investigated.The advanced storage system can\nhave enough power and energy to substitute a generator for a few minutes in emergency\n\n\n\n1.4. Materials and methods 27\n\nmode of operation, this mode of operation is called spinning reserve. From the electrical\npoint of view our main objective is to analyse the voltage and frequency control provided\nby the battery for various operation modes.\n\n1.4 Materials and methods\n\nTo achieve the objectives a PSV power system as in[23] was implemented on Matrix\nLaboratory (MATLAB) SimPowerSystems. The PSV power system were modelled for\ndynamic analysis using in time-domain approach.The determination of the operation point\nof the diesel generators were performed using the optimal dispatch of (! ((!)HOMER).\nAditional models were developed in (!HOMER) to calculate the inicial dispatch values of\npower to supply the PSV demand. The simulations using the SimPowerSystems were set\nwith these initial dispatch conditions and the control models to verify if the frequency and\nvoltage were inside the limits. More details of the models will be disscussed in chapter 3.\n\n1.5 Publications\n\nThe published works during the Masters period are summarized below.\nPublications in international conferences:\n\n1.

Introduction\n\n\n\n29\n\nChapter 2\nBattery State of Art\n\nThis chapter aims at presenting a short overview on some battery technologies, con-\ntrasting them and highlighting its positive and negative points.\n\n2.1 Battery Overview\n\nAccording to [24], batteries can be divided in primary (non-rechargeable) and sec-\nondary (rechargeable). In the last years the batteries industry has undergone a tremen-\ndous growth, there was a increase on energy density and a decrease on battery cost.\n\nThe reduction on battery cost is the result of the popularization of batteries. Batteries\nhas became popular because they can absorb the power peaks and valleys better than\ndiesel generators that could be oversized, and therefore run out of their optimal point.\nBesides the advantage of covering peaks and valleys on some power systems, batteries\ncan help to operate diesel generators on their optimal point consuming less diesel and\nemitting less ??2.\n\nIn a power system composed of batteries and diesel generators, batteries can improve\nthe system reliability because they have a faster response than diesel generators , another\npoint is that this system reliability improvement will not cost an environmental concern,\nsince another way to improve reliability would be having two or more generators running\nthe system, it would move the operation point of the generators to a worst point of\noperation.\n\nIn Figure 2 is shown a comparative between discharge time at rated power and system\npower ratings of different battery technologies and theirs basic characteristics [25].The\ncomparisons presented in Figure 2 are very general and tried to show the reality in 2013,\nduration and power ranges are possibly broader because of the advance of the technologies.\nThere are a few candidates that might fit in the needs of ships with special attention to\nthe green area. The most common batteries are lead-acid and lithium-ion (or Li-Ion).\nHowever, flow batteries and NaS (sodium\u2013sulfur) batteries could be an interesting option\nfor systems that require high power rating and high periods of discharge[26].\n\n\n\n30 Chapter 2.

On [24] is set a list of minimum requirements in order to best achieve the\nbattery selection. The next subsection shows different methods to calculate the size and\nthe cost of batteries.\n\n2.1.1 Battery Sizing and Cost\n\nIn [28] is shown how to calculate the levelized cost of the stored energy (LCOE), the\nLCOE is a relation between total installed cost for the total lifetime of the project and\nthe energy injected by the battery. This works presents a calculation of the LCOE for\nthree batteries technologies, a Lithium-ion, a Redox-Flow and a Lead-Acid.\n\nIn [29] the objective is to find an optimal operation considering the cycle-life degra-\ndation, two mechanisms are tested, variable C-Rate and variable efficiencies. This work\nshows that the more you operate at a high C-rate, the largest will be the decrease in the\nbattery\u2019s State of Health(SoH). When the battery is operating under room temperature.\nIn this work is also shown that the increase on the charging/discharging C-rates, leads to\nan quadratically increase of the power losses.\n\nIn [30] is presented a matrix that shows which technology is more suitable for each\n\n\n\n2.1. Battery Overview 31\n\napplication, moreover this paper shows that energy storage systems can have four mainly\napplications: Bulk Energy applications ( energy arbitrage and peak shaving), Ancillary\nService Applications (voltage support, frequency regulation, spinning reserve, black start\nand load following ), Customer Energy Management Applications (power quality and\npower reliability), Renewable Energy Applications. It is also shown in [30] that the loca-\ntion of the storage system has a high importance because from this location usually derives\nits function. Although this work says that electrochemical batteries are not suitable for\nenergy arbitrage there are some works that have studied this application [31, 32, 33, 34].\n\nBased on the works cited above we can affirm that to size the battery we firstly should\ndefine which objective we are aiming at, the three mainly functions of energy storage\nsystems in a power system, are:\n\n? Stability Control - The increase on renewable energy brought a challenge of gen-\neration variability, moreover the use of diesel generators to support variations of the\nload can be not recommended regarding the regulations to reduce emission, besides\nthe regulation batteries are faster and can attend the demand before the generators\nto allow the generators to ramp up slowly. The converter, that connects the battery\nto the grid, can also help on the voltage control doing the reactive power balance.\nIn a grid without renewables, batteries can also increase the reliability, attending\nthe critical loads if the generator fails. Sizing the battery to stability control should\ntake into account which will be the role of the battery in the system, as said before\noperating a battery in high C-rates reduces the state of health, therefore diminishes\nthe life cycle of the battery. Although the costs of the battery are a very important\npart of the investment in a hybrid grid, for some applications the cost of the batter-\nies can be the minor problem compared to the result that a lack of reliability can\ncause;\n\n? Energy Arbitrage - When a battery is sized aiming at this objective the battery\nshould be sized aiming a profit, the profit can be obtained buying the energy when\nit has a lower price storing it and have a profit when the price increases, the amount\nof energy stored will represent the amount of profit, in this case the degradation of\nthe battery and the net present value are extremely important, since a battery that\ndegrades fast will not have a long life, therefore can not provide enough profit to\npay its cost;\n\n? Emission Regulation - As shown on Chapter 1.1, the emissions regulations have\nbecame very strict through the years for ships, the same can be said about the\nemission regulations for some islands and for some territories, California created, in\n1967, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and since then has reduced in\n90% the black carbon emission. California is aiming at having 33% of electricity\ncoming from renewable source, by 2020. CARB also aims at reduce the emissions\n\n\n\n32 Chapter 2. Battery State of Art\n\nfrom agriculture and vehicles[35]. Size the battery to meet emission regulation\nusually will mean size a battery to force the generators to operate at their lowest\nemission/consumption point.\n\n2.1.2 Generic Schematics of Battery\n\nGeneric models of batteries describe their electrochemical phenomena occurring using\nelectrical active and passive components [36]. The generic models can be divided in:\n\n(A) ???? Model\n\nThe ???? model, shown on Figure 3 is the most simplified model of batteries, in\nthis model we do not consider a different value for the charge and for the discharge\nresistance. The open-circuit voltage, ??? , is constant. This model can be considered\nfor simulations on which the energy available is infinite and the transient phenomena\ncan be neglected [36]. In our analysis we used this model since it did not require\nhigh computational effort.\n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Battery electrical model ???? .\n\nV\noc\n\nR\nch/disch\n\nSource: Adapted from [36].\n\n(B) Modified Thevenin Model\n\nFigure 4 shows an modified Thevenin model, that can be also named as a modified\nversion of the ???? model. This model has a resistance of charge and a resistance\nof discharge, it possibilities the battery to have a current to charge and another to\ndischarge[37].\n\n\n\n2.1.

This model is an\nextended form of the Thevenin model where additional RC networks are connected\nin series to model additional internal voltage drops, the number of RC dipoles must\nbe chosen according to the accuracy of the model [36].\n\n\n\n34 Chapter 2.

Compared to these other batteries presented in [38],\nlithium-ion presents very good results when energy and power density are highlighted.\nThe data presented on Table 2 shows diverse parameters for lithium-ion batteries.\n\nTable 2 \u2013 Lithium-ion Characteristics\n\nAdapted from [38]\n\nMetric Lithium-ion\nSpecific Energy [Wh/kg] 30-300\nEnergy Density [KWh/m3] 94-500\nSpecific Power [W/Kg] 8-2,000\nPower Density [KW/m3] 56.80-800\nEfficiency [%] 70-100\nLifespan [yr] 2-20\nCycle Life [cycles] 250-10,000\nSelf-Discharge Rate [%/day] 0.03-0.33\nScale [MW] 0.00-3.00\nEnergy Capital Cost [US$/kWh] 200.00-4,000.00\nPower Capital Cost [US$/kW] 175.00-4,000.00\n\nApplication Small/Medium ScaleEnergy Management\n\nTechnical Maturity MatureCommercialized\nEnvironmental Impact High/Medium\n\nNormally, battery installations have been sold in containers. The container should be\nbig enough to store the batteries, the refrigeration equipment, the control systems and\nhave enough space for maintenance. In a 20ft container, if we separate 60% of the space to\n\n\n\n2.3. Battery Choice 35\n\nthe batteries we would have around 19.82 ?3 available to install the battery system, using\nthe values presented on Table 2, we can calculate that the power range of the batteries\nthat can be installed in a 20ft container varies from 1.12 to 15.84 MW, whereas the energy\nrange varies from 1.87 to 9.96 MWh.\n\nThe first rechargeable Lithium-ion batteries were put on Market by Sony, in 1991.\nThese batteries have a liquid electrolyte, the lithium ions swing between the anode and\nthe cathode [39]. According to [40], the first generation of lithium-ion batteries con-\nsisted of ?????2 and graphite at the cathode and anode electrodes, after this battery\nothers were developed, such as: ??? ??2, ??? ?2?4, ??? ?1????? ??????2, ??? ?? ?4,\n??4? ?5?12, these batteries have reached the market at different levels and had intrinsic\nlimitations derived from the redox mechanism related to the crystal structural aspects of\nthe material[40].\n\nDuring the tests of these many chemistries of Lithium-ion batteries, various types of\nelectrolytes were tested, however liquid electrolytes are the most common electrolytes for\nthese batteries, organic electrolyte solvents that are flammable should be avoided because\nthe presence of these solvents can lead to a thermal runaway, increase the heat generation\ncausing a fire [40]. There are many researches aiming the improvement of the Li-ion\nbattery\u2019s performance, some examples are shown on [41, 42, 43, 44].\n\nLithium-ion batteries are the most mature battery for power systems applications, on\n[45] more than 700 projects using li-ion batteries can be found. Some of these projects will\nbe highlighted here, in Australia a project which is under construction and is expected to\nbe ready at August, 2019 aims to install 20 MW/34 MWh lithium-ion battery, alongside\nthe batteries will be installed 56 wind turbines adding up 194 MW of generation capacity\n[46]. In California, more precisely in Orange County a 35 MW/140MWh lithium-ion\nbattery is going to be installed by 2020 the objective of this installation is to give electrical\ncapability and extra grid balance to that area [47].\n\n2.3 Battery Choice\n\nAlthough there is a vast number of batteries, some are still being developed and do not\nhave a mature technology. Ships require batteries with a high power and energy density\nbecause of the space restriction, another point is that the batteries should have a higher\ncharge and discharge rate since the batteries can help the ship power system in a failure\nof the generators so that the system does not collapse. As was calculated on the section\nbefore, a 20 ft container storing lithium ion batteries can contain up to a maximum power\nof 15.84 MW and up to a maximum energy of 9.96 MWh, using the average data presented\non [38], 290 kWh/?3 and 366.4 kW/?3, the average power installed on a 20 ft container\nis 7.25 MW and the average energy is 5.74 MWh. It means that this battery calculated\nby the average parameters can be operated for around 3 hours without recharge at the\n\n\n\n36 Chapter 2. Battery State of Art\n\nrated power of the generators (4 x 1.85 MW) presented on the generic PSV studied in\nthis work. Based on these requirements that are very specific for ship power systems we\ncan find that lithium-ion batteries are the most suitable battery to be applied to the ship\npower system.\n\n\n\n37\n\nChapter 3\nHybrid Ship Power System Topology\n\nShip power systems are designed to fit in restrict spaces and to be reliable. A ship\npower system normally has two or three sections, each one with at least one generator and\none thruster, these sections can be interconnected through breakers, these interconnections\nhave to be fast enough to open before a fault reaches the entire system, the reliability\nlies on the selectivity study done. This study should take into account the number of\ngenerators and where they are going to be installed, the number of thrusters, the routine\nand the size of the ship.\n\nAC\n\nDC\n\nAC\n\nDC\n\nMOTMOT MOT MOT\n\nDiesel\n\nGenerator\n\n1,85 MW\n\n690 V\n\nDiesel\n\nGenerator\n\n1,85 MW\n\n690 V\n\nDiesel\n\nGenerator\n\n1,85 MW\n\n690 V\n\nDiesel\n\nGenerator\n\n1,85 MW\n\n690 V\n\nBreaker Breaker Breaker Breaker\n\nBus-tie\n\nBreaker\n\nBus-tie\n\nBreaker\n\nBreaker Breaker\n\nTransformer\n\n690V/270V\n\n3,7MVA\n\nTransformer\n\n690V/270V\n\n3,7MVA\n\nTransformer\n\n270V/48V\n\n400kVA\n\nY\n\nTransformer\n\n270V/48V\n\n400kVA\n\nY\n\nBattery\nBattery\n\nBase Load\n\n750kW\n\nService\n\nLoad\n\n300kW\n\nBow\n\nThruster\n\n910kW\n\nAzimuth\n\nThruster\n\n2MW\n\nBow\n\nThruster\n\n910kW\n\nAzimuth\n\nThruster\n\n2MW\n\nSide A Side B\n\nFigure 7 \u2013 Platform Supply Vessel Power System.\n\n\n\n38 Chapter 3. Hybrid Ship Power System Topology\n\nThe ship that is going to be studied is a PSV with four 1850kW diesel generators,\none 910kW bow thruster, one 800kW retractable bow thruster and two 2MW azimuthal\nthrusters. To improve the optimal point and the reliability two 1MW/5MWh battery are\ngoing to be installed. The PSV power system is divided in two sections each one with two\ngenerators, one battery and two thrusters as shown on Figure 7 . The following sections\nare going to explain each part of the hybrid power system.\n\n3.1 Diesel Engine Operation and Control\n\nIn the beginning, steam turbines were responsible to provide all the power demanded\nby the loads in ships [27]. Rudolf Diesel sells, in 1897, his first diesel engine. The advantage\nof his engine when compared to the others, that operate at that time, was that the cycle\nof operation of the diesel engine, was more efficient, when compared to the Otto Cycle,\nthis advantage allowed a great increase of the diesel-engine industry. The Danish M/S\nSelandia, known as the most advanced ship powered by diesel engines at that time, was\nbuilt in 1912 and was powered by two 935kW diesel engines.\n\nIn [27] is discussed about the ship power systems through the years. As is shown on\n[48] , the diesel engines are categorized as follows:\n\n? Category 1: High-speed four-stroke engines with up to 100kW shaft power;\n\n? Category 2: High-speed four-stroke engines with a shaft power between 100 and\n10.000kW;\n\n? Category 3: Medium-speed four-stroke engines with a shaft power between 5000\nand 30.000kW;\n\n? Category 4:Low-speed two-stroke crosshead engines with a shaft power between 100\nand 10.000kW.\n\nThe diesel generator control is basically divided in Governor and AVR, they are re-\nsponsible to control the frequency and the voltage, respectively.\n\n3.1.1 Diesel Engine Control - Governor\n\nGovernors or speed regulators are an integral part of fuel injection systems in diesel\nengines [48]. Governors have the following functions [48]:\n\n? Fuel-quantity control when the engine is started;\n\n? Fuel-quantity control during engine idling;\n\n\n\n3.1. Diesel Engine Operation and Control 39\n\n? Maintain a constant speed (frequency regulation) at fluctuating loads, such as in\ngensets with alternating power decreases as well as in propulsion systems with vary-\ning cargo and weather conditions;\n\n? Ensure that the maximum number of revolutions is not exceeded. Exceeding the\nmaximum speed may cause damage.\n\nIt is stablished by notable classification organizations that the speed regulation re-\nquirements to operate engines as the main generator or as a emergency generator are in\ngeneral [48]:\n\n? Maximum Transient frequency variations can not trespass 10%;\n\n? The system must return to the steady state frequency within 5s after the step load\napplication or thrown off;\n\n? The only case when the maximum transient frequency can trespass 10% is when the\ngenerator does not disconnect on over speed with 100% load rejection;\n\n? The over speed protection will disconnect the diesel generator when the engine\nreaches 115%.\n\nThere are roughly three different types of governor [48]:\n\n? Mechanical Governor;\n\n? Hydraulic Governor;\n\n? Electronic Governor.\n\n3.1.1.1 Mechanical Governor\n\nThey are predominantly used in engines from the categories I and II. Mechanical\nGovernor is a speed control device, this device has two suspended masses that goes up or\ndown according to the change of speed with the help of inertia, as can be seen on Figure\n8 [48].\n\n\n\n40 Chapter 3. Hybrid Ship Power System Topology\n\nFigure 8 \u2013 Mechanical Governor.\n\nSLIDING\n\nCOLAR\n\nROTATING\n\nSCHAFT\n\nROTATING\n\nWEIGHTS\n\nDRIVE FROM\n\nTHE ENGINE\n\nSource:Adapted from [49].\n\nThe mechanical governor is based on the principle of the centrifugal forces. It is\nconnected through a drive to the engine, at first we supose that the engine is running\nat a determined speed, an increase of the demand leads to a reduction of the engine\nspeed, on this way the centrifugal speed is also reduced pulling up the sliding collar and\nthen increasing the amount of fuel injected on the engine and increasing the speed of the\nengine. On the other hand, if the load is decreased the speed of the engine is increased\nand the centrifugal speed is also increased pushing the rotating weights of the governor\naway from the rotating shaft. When the rotational weights are pushed away they pull\ndown the sliding collar restricting the amount of fuel and slowing the speed of the engine.\nThe distance between the rotational weights and the rotating shaft is proportional to the\nspeed of rotation [50] .\n\n3.1.1.2 Hydraulic Governor\n\nThese governors are more sensitive than the mechanical ones, moreover, as shown on\nFigure 9 these governors have a hydraulic power piston, also known as servomotor that\nprovides pump capacity to the governor, giving to the governor power to alterate the fuel\ncontrol system [51].\n\n\n\n3.1. Diesel Engine Operation and Control 41\n\nFigure 9 \u2013 Hydraulic Governor.\n\nPOWER PISTON\n\nINCREASE\n\nFUEL\n\nTHROTTLE\n\nOIL PRESSURE\n\nPILOT-VALVE\n\nOIL\n\nSUPPLY\n\nD\nR\n\nA\nIN\n\nPORT\n\nSource:[51].\n\nAs shown on Figure 9, the hydraulic governor has a different working principle, on\nthis governor the increase on fuel happens according to the variation of the oil pressure,\nmoving the power piston upwards and downwards. The oil pressures the power piston\nafter passing through the port, the pilot valve closes or opens the port according to the\nspeed, when the measured speed reaches the reference speed the pilot valve closes and\nthere is no oil passage, when there is a difference between the measured and the reference\nspeed the pilot valve moves and the oil passes through the port.\n\n3.1.1.3 Electronic Governor\n\nThese governors are often applied in diesel engines in categories III and IV and in-\ncreasingly often in category II. Apart from controlling the set speed, electronic governors\nserve numerous purposes [48]:\n\n? Excessively high speeds are avoided;\n\n? Maximum fuel supply is limited;\n\n? Maximum scavenging-air pressure is limited;\n\n? When the engine is started, the electronic governor controls the maximum fuel\nquantity available ;\n\n\n\n42 Chapter 3. Hybrid Ship Power System Topology\n\nThe basic principle of the electronic governor is its comparison of the set speed and the\nactual speed. To achieve the required speed the actuator that is fixed to the fuel adjusting\nspindle receives a signal that represents a certain discrepancy betwixt the defined speed\nand the real speed. The spindle is adjusted by the actuator until the set speed be reached\n[52].\n\nFigure 10 \u2013 Electronic Governor.\n\nACTUATOR\n\nGAS\n\nTURBINE\nGENERATOR\n\nSPEED\n\nSENSOR\n\nGOVERNOR\n\nFUEL\n\nFUEL VALVE\nVTs\n\nCTs\nLOAD\n\nSource:[52].\n\nOn Figure 10 is shown a simplified electronic governor control system, this governor\nhas a selectable isochronous/droop control. The basic inputs of the electronic governors\nincludes current and voltage transformers, the speed is measured by the tachometer, these\ninputs allow the implementation of the control strategy (isochronous or droop). The power\noutput required is achieved by the control of the governor on the fuel valve. [52]\n\n3.1.1.4 Matlab Governor\n\nOn Figures 11 and 12 are shown the governors used on Matlab. On Figure 11 the\nsubtraction of the velocity measured from the reference speed is subtracted by the relation\n?????? * ????? and the result is the input of the control system of the regulator and the\nresult is multiplied by the regulator gain then it goes to the actuator transfer function\nand is integrated resulting in the torque. The torque is feedback to the system being\nmultiplied by a droop.\n\n\n\n3.1.

This governor allows the generators to operate at\ndifferent points by setting different values for the droop. It is possible that the frequency\nof operation does not get close to the frequency of reference, it happens because the droop\ncontrol is based on the speed error, the speed error is multiplied by a proportional gain\nresulting in the power dispatched from the generators to reduce the error, this proportional\ngain can cause a steady state error in frequency that remains while the governor causes a\nsteady state change in the power required from the prime mover.\n\nOn 12 the subtraction of the velocity measured from the reference speed goes to\nthe control system without the ? ????? * ????? reduction, analysis performed with this\ngovernor do not allow a load sharing based on droop. On the other hand by using this\ngovernor, the generators operate following the reference frequency.\n\nFigure 12 \u2013 Governor-Isochronous Control.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n+\n\n-\n\n+\n-\n\n0.2s+1\n\n0.0002s +0.01s+1\n2\n\n0.25s+1\n\n0.009s+1\n20\n\n1\n\n0.0384s+1\n\nT 2FT 1F\n\nACTUATOR\n\nGainControl System\n\nw (pu)\nreference\n\nw (pu)\nmeasured\n\n1\ns\n\nIntegrator\n\nTorque\n\nEngine\n\nTd\n\n1\n\nPmec (pu)\n\nSource:Author.\n\n3.1.2 Load Sharing Schemes\n\nIn [53] is presented four load sharing scheme:\n\n\n\n44 Chapter 3. Hybrid Ship Power System Topology\n\n3.1.2.1 Speed Droop\n\nThis mode of load division allows a partition of the load based on the value of the\ndroop that is set [53].\n\n3.1.2.2 Compensated Speed Droop\n\nPower Management System (PMS) uses this method because it alows the adjustment\nof the frequency and of the participation of each generator. The PMS is necessary because\nit is responsible for moving the droop lines up and down on all the generators dividing\nthe load in equal portions, each part is going to be attended by each generator , this is\nimportant because allows a maintenance planning for all the generators this method also\nmaintain a constant frequency through the load variations. The PMS needs to know,\npreviously, the if the generator is connected and which load is fed by this generator [53].\n\n3.1.2.3 Isochronous\n\nThe isochronous mode of load sharing does a equal division of the loads between the\ngenerators. This mode aims at keeping the frequency steady regardless the variations of\nthe system load. [53].\n\n3.1.2.4 Master Slave\n\nThis control has two main parts [53]:\n\n? Speed Droop : This loop sends a signal to the actuator to retain the main generator\nworking at a defined point speed;\n\n? Load Control: Applies an additional command signal, equivalent to the load, to the\nactuator.\n\nThe combination of the both parts keep the generators frequency and allows the gen-\nerators to cover the fluctuation of the loads. On our analysis we pursue simulations to\nanalyse the governors set at isochronous and speed droop mode.\n\n3.1.3 Diesel Engine Control - Automatic Voltage Regulator\n\nWhereas the frequency control is obtained with the governors, the voltage control is\nobtained with the AVR. In a parallel operation between various diesel generators, the\nAVR is also responsible for sharing the reactive power between the generators[53]. AVR\nis considered a good option because it controls the voltage output through a field exciter\nof the synchronous generator for applications that require variable speed [54].\n\n\n\n3.2. Distribution System 45\n\n3.1.3.1 Matlab AVR\n\nThe AVR used on this matlab model is designed on Figure 13, as shown on Figure 13\nthe inputs from the machine are the reference value of the stator terminal voltage (???? ),\nthat is a constant set on 1.0, the measured value of the stator terminal voltage (??) is\nthe square root of the sum of the squares of ?? and ??, ????? which is set to zero and the\nmeasured value of the stator field current (?? ?) that is the square root of the sum of the\nsquares of ?? and ??. The output that goes to the synchronous machine is the field voltage\n(?? ?). The constants were set according to [55].\n\nThe model shown in Figure 13 represents the model presented on the simpowersystems\nlibrary of the matlab, to control the voltage of the synchronous machine, it is also known\nas an excitation system. This excitation system represents an alternate current alterna-\ntor that drives a diode rectifier to deliver the field voltage required by the synchronous\nmachine. The excitation system used is cited as the Type AC1A on the IEEE standard\nfor excitation systems [55].\n\nFigure 13 \u2013 Matlab AVR.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n+\n\n+\n\n-\n\n+\n\n-\n\n+\n-\n\ns+1\n\ns+1\n\nTransient Gain\n\nReduction\n\n(Tc*s+1)/(Tb*s+1)\n\nTc=0\n\nTb=0\n\nV\nref\n\nV\nt Integrator\n\nLimits\n\n[-5.43  6.03]\n\n1\n\nEfd\n\n1\n\n1e-06s+1\n\nVfe0\n\nKa\n\n4\n\nV\nstab\n\n1\n\ns+1\n\n14.5 V\n\n-14.5 V\n\nMain Regulator\n\nKa/(Ta*s+1)\n\nKa=200\n\nTa=0.02\n\n1/0.8\n1\n\ns X\n\nX\n\nVe\n\nIfd\nFex\n\n3\n\nIfd\n\nVeVx\n\n1\n\n0.38\n\n+\n+\n\n+\n+\n\ns+1\n\ns+1\n\nDamping Filter\n\nKf*s/(Tf*s+1)\n\nKf=0.03\n\nTf=1\n\nSaturation\n\nVx=Ve*(Se[Ve])\n\nSource:Author.\n\n3.2 Distribution System\n\nResearch efforts in power distribution are mainly related to improving dynamic per-\nformance and greater quality of service [56]. There are three main distribution system\nconcepts in all electric power ship: Medium Voltage Alternate Current (MVAC), High\nFrequency Alternate Current (HFAC) and Medium Voltage Direct Current (MVDC) [57].\n\n3.2.1 Generic MVDC Distribution Topology\n\nFuture naval warships that are equipped with synchronous generators to run the ship\npower system are one example to show that this topology has been considered to ships.\nFuture naval warships are considered as a good system to receive the MVDC distribution\n\n\n\n46 Chapter 3. Hybrid Ship Power System Topology\n\ntopology because of its high power demand. An example of a MVDC topology is shown\nat Figure 14.\n\nThis topology have been considered for electrical power systems that require a high\npower density and need a strong reliability, the Electric Ship Research and Development\nConsortium (ESRDC) has investigated the dynamic performance of the MVDC distribu-\ntion to find if this topology can achieve this greater quality of service when a high power\ndensity is required [57].\n\nThe MVDC distribution is also the focus of many ship builders because this topology\noffers the possibility to rise the fuel-efficiency of the generators besides that this topology\noffers more flexible designs to the ship power system [58].\n\nFigure 14 \u2013 MVDC Topology.\n\nZone 4\n\nLoad\n\nCenter\n\nZone 3\n\nLoad\n\nCenter\n\nZone 2\n\nLoad\n\nCenter\n\nZone 1\n\nLoad\n\nCenter\n\nPort Propulsion MotorPort Propulsion Motor\n\nMotor\n\nDrive\n\nMotor\n\nDrive\n\nRectifier\n\nAC Breaker\n\nRectifier\nMain\n\nGenerator\n\nAuxiliary\n\nGenerator\n\nMain\n\nGenerator\n\nAuxiliary\n\nGenerator\n\nMotor\n\nDrive\n\nStarboard\n\nPropulsion\n\nMotor\n\nEnergy Storage\n\nDC/DC\n\nDC/DC\n\nRadar\n\nPulsed\n\nLoad\n\nPulse\n\nCharging\n\nDC/DC\n\nSource:[57].\n\n3.2.2 Generic MVAC Distribution Topology\n\nMVAC electrical distribution systems are very difunded throught many ships . Electric\npropulsion has advanced because of the advances in power electronics [58]. The frequency\nof distribution system must be fixed (kept constant) to maintain the 50 or 60 Hz (depends\non the nominal value), independently of the loading conditions. This topology usually\nresults in a sub-optimal use of prime movers (e.g. diesel generators) because of the\nvariability of the load. This topology requires a coordination between the generators to\nkeep them synchronized.\n\n\n\n3.2.

Hybrid Ship Power System Topology\n\n3.3 Propulsion System\n\nThe propulsion system is the mechanism to thrust or to maneuver the ship, it should\nbe designed respecting the individualities of each type of vessel.\n\n3.3.1 Types of Propeller\n\nPropellers can be divided into two main groups[48]:\n\n? Fixed Pitch Propeller (FPP);\n\n? Controllable Pitch Propeller (CPP):CPP are also known as Adjustable Pitch (AP)\nor Variable Pitch (VP) propellers.\n\n3.3.1.1 Fixed Pitch Propeller\n\nFP propellers are usually made of a very strong copper alloy. There is no variation\nof the angle of the blades, they are fixed and therefore the propeller pitch is fixed and\ncannot be modified. Because of the fixed pitch the propeller\u2019s performance depends on\nthe marine conditions [48].\n\nThis type of propellers is applied to ships that does not require sophisticated ma-\nneuvering capabilities container ships and bulk carriers are some examples. These ships\ngenerally travel great distances on the high seas and do not berth frequently. They can\nsafely enter ports to load and discharge aided by their bow thrusters (container ships)\nand/or by tugs (bulk carriers) [48].\n\n3.3.1.2 Controllable Pitch Propeller\n\nCP propellers differs from the FP propellers mainly because CP propellers have a\nhydraulic mechanism that allows the pitch control, therefore the angle of their blades is\ncontrollable, this propeller has a relatively large hub . Although the price is three or four\ntimes more expensive than the FP propeller, the large hub reduces the propeller efficiency\n[48]. The propeller is also more vulnerable in service than a fixed pitch propeller. CP\npropellers are often used in ships that require manoeuvrings. Ferries, container-feeder\nships, dredgers, ro-ro ships, offshore vessels and others [48]. There is no need of change\nthe direction of rotation of the engine when the CP propeller is used, in this case the ship\ncan move forwards and in astern direction.\n\n3.3.2 Transverse Thruster-Bow and Stern Thruster\n\nBow thrusters used in this work are impellers mounted inside a tunnel which is aligned\nathwart, this thruster system is also called transverse thruster. When the transverse\nthruster is located at the bow it is termed as bow thruster whereas when is located at the\n\n\n\n3.3. Propulsion System 49\n\nstern, stern thruster [59]. The transverse thrusters can move the ships only in towards or\nbackwards of the direction that it was installed, for this reason transverse thrusters are\nusually used for propulsion\n\n3.3.3 Azimuthing Thrusters\n\nAzimuthing thrusters are a subdivision of the Azimuthing and Podded propulsors,\nthese thrusters differs from the transverse thrusters by the maneuverability, they can\nmove to any direction and for this reason they are used in ships that require dynamic\npositioning, as the number of ships that require DP has increased on the recent years\nthese thrusters have gained importance [59].\n\n3.3.4 Direct Torque Control (DTC)\n\nControl the torque of variable-speed drives brings some benefits described in [60].\nDTC has been used to control Torque of induction machines and permanent magnet\nsynchronous machines as can be seen on [60, 61, 62]. This control is named as DTC\nbecause the electromagnetic torque can be controlled by the stator flux-linkage space\nvector. A change on the stator voltage causes a change on the stator flux-linkage space\nvector [63].\n\nFigure 17 \u2013 Schematic of the induction motor control by using DTC.\n\nOn Fig.17 is shown the DTC induction motor drive implemented on Matlab to control\nthe Induction Motor, the DTC unit inputs are the current between lines A and B (Iab),\nthe voltage between lines A,B and C (Vabc), Flux and Torque. The DTC unit is the\nfocus of Fig.17.\n\nThe inputs of the Electromagnetic torque and stator flux linkage estimator block\nare the components abc and ab of the voltage and current, respectively,these inputs are\nconverted to dq to make possible to calculate the stator flux for both d and q components,\nthe following equations show the calculation of flux and torque:\n\n? ?????????? =\n??\n\n(?? ? ?? * ??)?? (1)\n\n\n\n50 Chapter 3. Hybrid Ship Power System Topology\n\n? ?????????? =\n??\n\n(?? ? ?? * ??)?? (2)\n\n? ????????? = ? ???? ? ? * ? ???? (3)\n\n? ????? =\n?? 3\n\n2\n* ? (? ???? * ?? + ? ???? * ??)?? (4)\n\nWhere ??,?? are the stator voltages on the dq components, ??,?? are the stator currents\non the dq components, ?? is the stator phase resistance of the induction motor and P is\nthe number of pole pairs of the induction motor.\n\n3.3.5 Matlab Propulsion Control\n\nThe matlab model for the propulsion control has two inputs that can be set by the\nuser: the reference torque and the reference speed, these inputs are highlighted in blue\non Figure 18. According to [59] the torque can be calculated by\n\n? = ?? ??2?4 (5)\n\nWhere ?? means the thrust coefficient, ? means the mass density of water, ? means the\npropeller rotational speed(rev/s) and ? means the propeller diameter(m). According to\n[59],the reference stator frequency can be calculated by:\n\n? =\n?? * ?\n\n120\n(6)\n\nWhere ?? means the number of machine poles, ? represents the stator frequency (Hz)\nand ? is the reference speed (RPM). As can be seen on Figure 18 the propulsion control\ndesigned to this model is a three phase system, that is connected through a AC-DC-\nAC converter, highlighted in red on Figure 18, that isolates the system from frequency\nalterations in the propulsion.\n\nThe matlab block named as speed controller on Figure 18 is based on a PI regulator,\nthe measured speed is regulated through the PI control to reach the reference speed, the\noutputs of this block are the set points of the flux and torque that are the applied to the\nDTC block.\n\nThe DTC block receives other two inputs, the current and the voltage measured in\nthe induction machine, from these last two mentioned inputs are calculated the estimated\ntorque and the flux. The estimated flux and the set points of flux go to a two-level\nhysteresis comparator for flux control, whereas the estimated torque and set point of\ntorque go to a three-level hysteresis comparator for torque.\n\nThe Braking Chopper is composed of an capacitor in parallel to a diode in series to a\nresistance, this block dissipates the energy produced by deceleration of the motor.\n\n\n\n3.3.

The two azimuth thrusters and the two\nbow thrusters of the PSV propulsion system were simulated using the system designed\non Matlab mentioned before. On the simulations of the DTC, the torque was varied\nrandomly.\n\nFigure 19 \u2013 DTC\u2019s Rotor Speed results for 800kW and 910kW bow thruster and 2MW azimuth thruster.\n\nTime (s)\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n\nR\no\n\nto\nr \n\nS\np\n\ne\ne\n\nd\n (\n\nra\nd\n\n/s\n)\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\nSource:Author.\n\nOn Figure 19 is shown the curve of the rotor speed variation it takes around 5 seconds\nto reach the reference rotor speed of 1000 rad/s remaining steady from 5 to 60 seconds\nat 1000 rad/s.\n\n\n\n52 Chapter 3.

Figure 20(a) and Figure 21(a)\nare focused on the torque results, as can be seen the torque varies during the simulation\naiming to reach the operational active power of each thruster. Figure 20(b) and Figure\n21(b) show the active power results as can be seen at the end of the simulation the\nthrusters achieve the nominal power of them. The variations on torque causes an impact\non flux and on active and reactive power. On Figure 20(c) and Figure 21(c) are shown\nthe flux results for the 800kW and 910kW bow thrusters and for the 2MW azimuth\nthruster, respectively. As can be seen the flux is kept in a short variation range, the\nbiggest variation for the three thrusters happened between 0 and 5 seconds, this variation\nhappened because the rotor speed was increasing and reaching its operational point, 1000\nrad/s. Figure 20(d) and Figure 21(d) show the reactive power results as can be seen\nthe reactive power varies according to the variation on torque for all the thrusters, the\nthrusters operate with a power factor equals to 0.84.\n\n\n\n3.3.

Although the results shown that the models are\nworking and the 2MW azimuth thrusters and the two bow thrusters were designed in\na matlab model, this model was not used on the analysis shown on the next chapter\nbecause of the computational effort required to run the model of the thrusters connected\nto the grid model. On the next chapter is shown how the load model was created to best\nrepresent the load demand required from the propellers and from the loads.\n\n\n\n54 Chapter 3.

Moreover are shown three analysis: the first aims at showing a\ndiesel-electric system, without battery, operating during missions of the PSV, the second\nwas designed to analyse the impact on voltage, frequency, diesel and emissions that the\nbatteries could have on a hybrid PSV operating during the DP operation, the third anal-\nysis desires to present the gain of operating the diesel generators closer to their optimal\npoint, leaving the frequency control to the battery.\n\n4.1 Power Quality and Control Systems\n\nThis section discuss the requirements that ship power systems must attend to maintain\nin acceptable levels its power quality, it also discuss the importance of control systems to\nkeep the system running under the limits of the standards.\n\n4.1.1 Power Quality\n\nAs there is a high variability of the power demand in ships and sometimes the power\nstep can reach some megawatts the quality of the electricity became very important as\nsome equipments does not support a large range of variation in frequency or voltage.The\nship power system has various operating conditions, such as: DP, manoeuvring, stand-\nby sea voyage, port and harbour operation. During these periods, the power demand\nchanges significantly [64]. International standards were created aiming at stablish limits\nof variation in frequency and voltage [64]. Table 3 shows the PN-IEC-60092-101 that\nstablishes limits for ship power systems, named as \u201cElectrical installations in ships\u2013Part\n101 : Definitions and general requirements\u201d, it is based on the IEC [65].\n\n\n\n56 Chapter 4.

Ship owners usually report their problems\nrelated to power quality, some of these problems are listed in the following [66]:\n\n? There is no communication between the control of the different systems, because of\nthat control dynamic interations between these systems is difficult;\n\n? The control of the reactive power is a problem;\n\n? There is no monitoring of the power factor, since the reactive power control is a\nproblem, an insertion of reactive loads or a filter loss can cause a voltage stability\nproblem.\n\n4.2 Operation Mode\n\nThe distribution system can be divided in two, three or four sections, these sections and\nbe connected by use of bus-ties. Although there is a possibility to divide the distribution\nsystem in more than 3 sections it is not very common. Normally, the number of generators\nand thrusters are equally divided between two sections. The DP operations is the most\ndangerous operation in the PSV routine, for this reason is very important to have a good\nreliability. Dynamic Positioned (DP) vessels can operate on open or closed bus-tie mode.\nThis decision is based on the operation and on the integrity of power operation. On one\nhand operating in closed bus-tie mode provides superior tolerance for dynamic positioning\npower plant faults but is not guaranteed that this operation mode will retain thrusters\nduring certain types of power systems failures [67] . On the other hand, operating in open\nbus is required when retention of thrusters is necessary.\n\n\n\n4.2. Operation Mode 57\n\n4.2.1 Closed Bus-Tie Mode\n\nThe International Maritime Organization published in 1994 \u201cGuidelines for vessels\nwith dynamic positioning systems \u201d, this document treats about DP systems and estab-\nlishes a division between them according to the characteristics that each group must have\n[68].\n\nA growing awareness arising from closed bus-tie DP operations pushed some classifica-\ntion societies and industry organizations to move forward, developing rules and guidelines\non which design requirements and test procedures are intended to elaborate the concept\nof \u201cequivalent integrity of power operation \u201d, while others maintained their position.\nThis deviation between the societies represents a source of confusion, uncertainty and\nnon-uniformity in the design requirements [?].\n\nSome classification societies that the acceptance of High Voltage DP power systems\noperating in closed bus tie shall be based on the results of live short circuit tests (\u201cfault\nride through tests \u201d). These tests consist in create a short circuit at the high voltage\nswitchboard level, to prove that the power and the control systems are able to detect and\nisolate the fault, without any blackout occurrence [?].\n\nInternationally recognized organizations that are in favor to perform these tests sta-\nblished a period of every 5 years during the lifespan of the vessel. On the other hand,\nclassification societies that are not in favor of carrying out those type of tests, claim that\nthey are dangerous to the personnel and stressful for the equipment [?].\n\nThe advances on switchboard protection relays have open the possibility to run the DP\noperation with closed bus ties, besides these advances another characteristic that helped\nto happen this operation in this configuration was the presence of thruster drives together\nwith the new Power System Management that can prevent blackouts and can reduce the\nload in a more precise and faster way. Run the DP operation with the bus closed allows\na more flexible utilisation of the generators increasing the fuel economy, it was not done\nbefore because the switchboard protections did not offer security. In [69] is shown that\nrunning the engines with an optimized loading offers a significant fuel saving .\n\n4.2.2 Open Bus-Tie Mode\n\nThe operation with the bus-tie opened is required when the vessel is on the DP mode\nto ensure the availability of thrusters during any equipment fault but it reduces the overall\npower plant reliability, because an overload can happen if a generator fail and the control\nsystem does not work. During the DP mode, if one thruster fails and this fail pass other\nthrusters the vessel can move towards the platform or port and sink, to diminish this\npossibility the bus-tie is opened, so if a fault occurs in one of the thrusters the captain\ncan stop the DP operation and move the ship away from the platform.\n\n\n\n58 Chapter 4. Power Generation Control\n\n4.3 Power Routine Construction\n\nThe power routine was elaborated based on [70]. As shown on this work the percentage\nof time for each operation is equivalent to Figure 22, as can be seen the DP operation is\nthe mission that last for more time, almost half of the whole routine, standby and loading\nin port are equivalent to 35% of the whole operation, and laden voyage and partial load\nvoyage that are the two operations that require more power are equivalent to 17% of the\ncomplete routine.\n\nDP Operation\n\n48%\n\nStandby\n\n19%\n\nLoading\n\nin\n\nPort\n\n16%\n\nLaden\n\nVoyage\n\n8%\nPartial\n\nLoad\n\nVoyage\n\n9%\n\nFigure 22 \u2013 Percentage of time for each operation of the PSV routine.\n\nThe routine shown on Figure 23 was used in all simulations. The demand for each\noperation was based on the loads that the generic PSV analysed has, this is described on\nthe following list:\n\n? Port Operation - During the Port Operation the ship is loaded, during this oper-\nation the thrusters are off,the load demand results from the variations on base load\nand the service load, around 1MW. Since this operation requires less power than\nthe generators offer when operating at their optimal point, around 1.6 MW, in a\nhybrid PSV the batteries can be charged, utilizing the generation excess during this\noperation.\n\n? Laden Voyage - The Laden Voyage refers to the voyage between port and platform\nor vice versa, on which the PSV fully loaded, in this operation the power demand\nrequired from the thrusters varies closer to their maximum demand, the base load\nand the service load are also operating, therefore this operation requires around\n6MW from the diesel generators and batteries in the hybrid PSV, since the demand\nis very high this operation does not looks suitable for charge the batteries, on the\ncontrary the batteries will probably help the generators to cover the loads.\n\n\n\n4.3. Power Routine Construction 59\n\n? Dynamically Positioning - The DP operation is the most dangerous operation\nof the PSV in this operation the PSV stops by the platform. In this operation the\nthrusters are automatically controlled by the computers to keep the PSV steady. To\nincrease the reliability the four generators are operating with the bus-tie opened, in\ncase of a fault on one side the other side has enough power to close the operation and\nmove the ship away from the platform. For safety reasons the battery is required to\noperate in spinning reserve during DP, it means that the battery must have enough\nenergy to cover the DP demand for at least 10 minutes. The base load and the\nservice load can be connected and the demand from the thrusters varies according\nto the wave and wind forces, the demand varies around 1.8MW\n\n? Partial Load Voyage - This operation refers to a voyage between platform and\nport or vice versa on which the PSV is partially loaded, compared to the laden\nvoyage the thrusters require less power, the base load and the service loads are\nconnected and the demand varies around 5.5MW.\n\n? Stand-by - The stand-by operation refers to the moment on which the PSV should\nstop offshore because the port or the platform are not ready to receive the PSV. The\nthrusters demand depend on the force of the waves, different from the DP operation\nthis operation does not require that the ship must stay steady. A hybrid PSV can\nalso charge the batteries during this operation or even use the batteries to power the\nsystem, disconnecting the diesel generators, the demand of the standby operation\nrequires about 900kW.\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\nHours (hr)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nP\no\n\nw\ne\n\nr \n(M\n\nW\n)\n\nLoading in Port\nLaden Voyage\nDP operation\nPartial Load Voyage\nStand-by\n\nFigure 23 \u2013 Power Routine.\n\nThe system shown on Figure 24 was implemented on Matlab to pursue the analysis,\nthe system is divided in two sides, in both sides, the system contains two generators, one\nazimuth thruster, one bow thruster, one general load that can be a service load or a base\n\n\n\n60 Chapter 4. Power Generation Control\n\nload and the energy storage system that is composed by the battery and the inverter, as\ncan be seen between the two sides there are two bus-tie breakers, they are very important\nbecause as said before there is a considerable discussion about how the bus-tie should be\noperated if closed or opened, in our analysis we operated with the bus-tie opened when\nwe performed an analysis on the DP operation and with the bus-tie closed for the other\noperations.\n\nAC\n\nDC\n\nAC\n\nDC\n\nMOTMOT MOT MOT\n\nDiesel\n\nGenerator\n\n1,85 MW\n\n690 V\n\nDiesel\n\nGenerator\n\n1,85 MW\n\n690 V\n\nDiesel\n\nGenerator\n\n1,85 MW\n\n690 V\n\nDiesel\n\nGenerator\n\n1,85 MW\n\n690 V\n\nBreaker Breaker Breaker Breaker\n\nBus-tie\n\nBreaker\n\nBus-tie\n\nBreaker\n\nBreaker Breaker\n\nTransformer\n\n690V/270V\n\n3,7MVA\n\nTransformer\n\n690V/270V\n\n3,7MVA\n\nTransformer\n\n270V/48V\n\n400kVA\n\nY\n\nTransformer\n\n270V/48V\n\n400kVA\n\nY\n\nBattery\nBattery\n\nBase Load\n\n750kW\n\nService\n\nLoad\n\n300kW\n\nBow\n\nThruster\n\n910kW\n\nAzimuth\n\nThruster\n\n2MW\n\nBow\n\nThruster\n\n910kW\n\nAzimuth\n\nThruster\n\n2MW\n\nSide A Side B\n\nFigure 24 \u2013 Platform Supply Vessel Power System.\n\nThe next sections show the results for the analysis performed during the masters.\nSection 4.5 presents a comparison between opened and closed bus-tie mode, with the\ngovernors of the generators operating at droop and isochronous mode. Section 4.6 is\nfocused on analyse the impact of operating the battery pursuing the peak shaving control,\nthe diesel generator is set at the average of the load demand and the batteries cover the\n\n\n\n4.4. Diesel Consumption Curve 61\n\nfluctuations. Section 4.7 was designed to observe the gain of operating using the batteries\nto maintain the generators operating at their optimal point.\n\n4.4 Diesel Consumption Curve\n\nThe analysis of diesel consumption and therefore emissions were performed based on\nthe curve shown on Figure25, as can be seen there is a considerable variation on operating\nthe diesel engine with a low demand or at it optimal point, around 0.9 pu, the difference\nbetween these points can reach 15%.\n\nNominal Power\n(%)\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\nD\nie\n\nse\nl C\n\no\nn\n\nsu\nm\n\ne\nd\n\n(g\n/k\n\nW\nh\n\n)\n\n180\n\n190\n\n200\n\n210\n\n220\n\nDiesel Consumption Curve\n\nFigure 25 \u2013 Diesel Consumption Curve\n\nSince the emissions are calculated on this work as a constant in gramms per liter\nof diesel operating at the optimal point of the diesel generator also leads to a higher\nreduction on emission.\n\n4.5 Comparative between Droop and Isochronous Mode\nin contrast to Opened and Closed bus-tie\n\nThis section aims to compare two control modes of load sharing presented on subsec-\ntion 3.1.2, moreover is traced a comparative between opened and closed bus-tie, presented\non section 4.2.\n\nSince this analysis is focused on the moment that the ship routine changes from the\nloading in port to the laden voyage, the load modelled on matlab was set to observe the\nworst case so the load representing the laden voyage demands 6.5MW from the diesel\ngenerators, it represents the maximum value shown on Figure 23 during the laden voyage\nmission, moreover the variation between the two missions is modelled as a ramp, it is\ndone because as shown before the thrusters require a variance on the torque to achieve\nthe nominal power, this variance is ramped.\n\n\n\n62 Chapter 4. Power Generation Control\n\nAs said before there is a discussion about how the bus-tie operated if it should be\nclosed or opened during operation, if opened brings more security in case of failure and\nnormally reduces the chances of exceeding the limits of frequency and voltage since the\nload is lower than when it is closed, if closed increases the possibility of running the diesel\ngenerators at its optimal point since the load is normally duplicated, therefore running\nthe diesel generators with the bus closed reduces diesel consumption and GHG emissions.\n\n4.5.1 Frequency and Voltage Control\n\nThis analysis is pursued in a diesel electric system, since it can be as a basis case to\nbe compared to the hybrid system with the battery, therefore the frequency and voltage\ncontrol is done by the governors and the AVR\u2019s.\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n\nG\ne\n\nn\ne\n\nra\nto\n\nrs\n A\n\nct\niv\n\ne\n P\n\no\nw\n\ne\nr\n\n(M\nW\n\n) \n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\nDroop Mode-Bus-Tie Opened\nDroop Mode-Bus-Tie Closed\nIsochronous Mode-Bus-Tie Opened\nIsochronous Mode-Bus-Tie Closed\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n\nL\no\n\na\nd\n\n A\nct\n\niv\ne\n\n P\no\n\nw\ne\n\nr\n(M\n\nW\n) \n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nTime [s]\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n\nF\nre\n\nq\nu\n\ne\nn\n\ncy\n(H\n\nz)\n\n47\n\n48\n\n49\n\n50\n\n51\n\n52\n\n53\n\nFigure 26 \u2013 Active power , state of charge and frequency results for opened and closed bus-tie for droop\nand isochronous mode.

Comparative between Droop and Isochronous Mode in contrast to Opened and Closed bus-tie 63\n\nAs can be seen when we compare the frequency results for open and closed bus-tie on\nFigure 26, the case with the governors operating sharing the loads by a droop and with\nthe bus-tie closed presents the frequency value most far from 50 Hz, that is the frequency\nreference.\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n\nG\ne\n\nn\ne\n\nra\nto\n\nrs\n R\n\ne\na\n\nct\niv\n\ne\n P\n\no\nw\n\ne\nr\n\n(M\nV\n\nA\nr)\n\n \n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\nDroop Mode-Bus-Tie Opened\nDroop Mode-Bus-Tie Closed\nIsochronous Mode-Bus-Tie Opened\nIsochronous Mode-Bus-Tie Closed\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n\nL\no\n\na\nd\n\n R\ne\n\na\nct\n\niv\ne\n\n P\no\n\nw\ne\n\nr\n(M\n\nV\nA\n\nr)\n \n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nTime [s]\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n\nV\no\n\nlta\ng\n\ne\n(p\n\nu\n)\n\n0.85\n\n0.9\n\n0.95\n\n1\n\n1.05\n\n1.1\n\nFigure 27 \u2013 Reactive power and voltage results for opened and closed bus-tie for droop and isochronous\nmode. The dashed line on frequency results means the limits of the PN-IEC-60092-101 for frequency.\n\nThere is also a difference between the frequency reference and the final frequency\npresented by the case with the bus-tie opened and the load sharing being also done by a\ndroop. This difference between the reference frequency and the final frequency for both\napproaches of bus-tie mode, is higher according to the number of diesel generators.Even\nthough the final frequency for both cases on which the droop control was applied is not\n50 Hz, its value is still allowed according to the norms. It can also be seen that more\ngenerators produces a impact on final frequency when droop control is used.\n\nWhen the isochronous control is used the frequency at 80 seconds is 50 Hz, it shows\n\n\n\n64 Chapter 4. Power Generation Control\n\nthat the isochronous control brings a best response when the variability of frequency must\nbe considered, here we also can compare the system operating with the bus-tie opened\nand closed, when it is opened the maximum frequency variation represents 0.28% whereas\nwhen it is closed this variation reaches 0.66%, representing more than the twice of that is\npresented when the bus is opened. It can also be seen that the generator set installed on\nthis PSV system can support the highest load variation that can occur. The variations\non frequency can be reduced by using batteries since the batteries have a faster response\nto cover the load demand.\n\nWhereas on Figure 26 can be seen that batteries can help on controlling frequency\nsince there is a small variation when only generators are operated, it cannot be said when\nthe voltage results are analysed on Figure 27, the voltage results on the system without\nbattery presents good results keeping the voltage very close to reference voltage of 1 pu.\nBatteries on voltage control can help as a backup in case of failure of the AVRs.\n\n4.5.2 Diesel Consumption and Emission Analysis\n\nTo conclude the analysis over the discussion about the load sharing and the bus-tie\noperation, table 4 was created, it shows a value of reduction compared to the best case,\nisochronous closed bus-tie, that was achieved in this 80 seconds of simulation.The diesel\nconsumption was based on the curve shown on Figure25. As can be seen, the operation\nwith the bus-tie closed produces the best results, for droop or for isochronous control,\ncomparing isochronous to droop the first one presents a slight gain when compared to\nthe other in both cases of the bus-tie operation mode. The discussion about the bus-tie\noperation mode must be pursued with careful since the reduction on diesel consumption\nand on GHG emission must be contrasted to the reliability and safety gain obtained by\noperating with the bus-tie opened.\n\nTable 4 \u2013 Diesel Consumption and GHG emissions - Negative values represent an increase of consumption.\n\nCase\n\nReduction on\nDiesel\n\nConsumed\n(%)\n\n??2\nreduction\n\n(%)\n\n? ??\nreduction\n\n(%)\n\nIsochronous - Closed Bus-tie ? ? ?\nDroop - Closed Bus-tie -0.71% -0.71% -0.71%\nIsochronous - Opened Bus-tie -16.15% -16.15% -16.15%\nDroop - Opened Bus-tie -16.49% -16.49% -16.49%\n\nBesides presenting the best results for diesel consumption and GHG emission, oper-\nating with the bus-tie closed in the isochronous load sharing mode also presents the best\nresults for frequency and voltage, by that we can choose the isochronous mode as the best\ncontrol mode for governors considering our analysis, moreover even considering that oper-\nating with the bus-tie closed can presents a higher frequency variation when compared to\n\n\n\n4.6. Peak Shaving 65\n\nthe operation with the bus-tie opened, it achieves the highest reduction when compared\nto the other cases analysed, since the frequency variation is very far of extrapolating the\nfrequency limits it can be chosen as the best mode of operation. Finally, based on the\nfrequency and voltage levels analysis and on the diesel consumption and on the GHG pre-\nsented emission we can say that our analysis presented that the best mode of operation\nis with the bus-tie closed and with the governor operating at the isochronous mode.\n\n4.6 Peak Shaving\n\nTo perform the analysis of Peak Shaving we defined that the generators and the\nbatteries would contribute to keep the frequency and the voltage under the limits set\nin the norm cited before. To set the generators to the average value of the loads two\ntechniques were applied as shown on Figure 28 :\n\nAccumulator\n\nLoad_Power\n\n(Delayed Signal)\n\nClear\n\n(every five seconds)\n\n1/5 +\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\nz\n-1\n\nz\n-2\n\nz\n-3\n\nz\n-4\n\nPower_Reference\n\na) Power References Computation for Variable Mean approach\n\nWashout Filter\n\nLoad_Power Power_Reference\n\nb) Power References Computation for Washout Filter approach\n\nFigure 28 \u2013 Platform Supply Vessel Power System.\n\nThe two techniques are described in the following:\n\n? Variable Mean - This approach requires a previous knowledge of the load, in our\ncase we created two load signals one is delayed from the other, the delayed signal\ngoes to the variable mean block and the signal not delayed is the load source, the\n\n\n\n66 Chapter 4. Power Generation Control\n\ndelayed signal goes to an accumulator that sums the values of the input and after five\nseconds is cleared, the value accumulated at the fifth second is divided by five and\ndelayed in one,two,three and four seconds, then these delayed signals are summed\nto the signal origined from the division per five of the accumulator, the output of\nthe adder is the power reference.\n\n? Washout Filter - The washout filter is used to soften the variations of the load,\nit rejects steady state inputs, while passing transient inputs. The general transfer\nfunction of a typical washout filter takes the form:\n\n?(?) =\n?\n\n? + ?\n(7)\n\nThe battery is connected to the system through an mosfet inverter, the battery role is\nto cover the variations of the load, whereas the generators are kept on the average of the\nloads. To control the dispatch of the battery, we developed the battery inverter control\nshown on Figure 29, it controls the injection of active power to control frequency and\nreactive power to control voltage by using as inputs the power reference signal which is\nthe output of the techniques mentioned before.\n\nPI\n\nwLgrid\n\nVq_measured\n\nPI\nId_ref\n\nX Iq_ref\n\nId_measured\n\nIq_measured\n\nReactive Powerref\n\nx\n\nx\n\nVDC\n\nmq\n\nmd\n\n0\n\nVref_dq\n\ndq0\nabcqgrid\n\nU\nref g\n\nPWM generator\n\n(3-Level)\n\ng\n\nVd_measured\nabc\n\ndq\n\nPLL\n\nabc\ndq\n\nIq_measured\n\nId_measured\n\nqgrid\n\nFreq\nVabc\n\nwLgrid\n\n2\n\nX\n\nX\n\nVd\n\n3/2\n\nVd_measured\n\nIabc\nqgrid\n\nqgrid\n\nVabc\nVq_measured\n\n+\n-\n\n+\n-\n\n+\n+\n+\n\n+\n+\n\nX\nX\n\nX\n\nVd\n\n3/2\n\n-\n\nActive Powerref\n\nFigure 29 \u2013 Battery Inverter Control Scheme for Peak Shaving.\n\nThe battery control scheme is shown on Figure 29, the first step is to change the ???\naxes to the ??0 axes, with the voltage from the ??? axes we can measure the frequency and\nthe angle of the positive-sequence of phase A. This angle will be used to obtain the Voltage\nand the current in the ??0 axes. The voltage and currents obtained by the transformation\nfrom the ??? axes to the ??0 axes are inputs to the control scheme as shown on Figure 29.\nThe reference current of the axis d is obtained dividing the ??????? ??????? per 1.5 * ??,\n?? is the voltage calculated of the d axis.\n\nThe reference current is subtracted from the measured current in each axis, this value\npass through a PI control which will reduce and integer the difference between the cur-\nrents. To calculate ?? we sum the result of the PI control with the ? ????????? and\n\n\n\n4.6. Peak Shaving 67\n\nsubtract from this sum the multiplication of the ?????????? per ? * ?????.????? comes from\nthe RL filter used for protection and as a filter, the design of the RL filter is explained on\n[71]. To calculate ?? we sum the result of the PI control with the ? ????????? and with\nthe multiplication of the ?????????? per ? * ?????. To finish ?? and ?? pass through a\nmux and the result is multiplied per 2 and divided per ??? , the result is the ???? _?? to\nchange back to the ??? axes we mux the ???? _?? to zero and the result on the ??? axes\ngoes to a PWM generator, that generates a signal to control the inverter.\n\nIn this analysis, the load was modelled as if the PSV came from a standby moment,\nwith no considerable power requisition from the thrusters, and then started the DP op-\neration, here since the power requisition from thrusters is lower than on laden voyage,\nthat was presented on the last analysis, the ramp to achieve the DP demand is almost\na step since the thrusters achieve their requisition faster. The DP demand modelled has\na variation because our focus here is to analyse the battery covering the peaks, keeping\nthe generators steady at the average load, the average load is similar in power to the\nDP operation. The voltage and frequency levels, the diesel consumption and some GHG\nemission are analysed. The first results are for the system without battery and after are\nshown the results for the system considering the two techniques explained before.\n\n4.6.1 Results without battery for Peak Shaving\n\nThis first results does not includes the battery in this simulation the system considered\nhas the thrusters, the generators and the general loads. The load required from the\nthrusters varies because in a real operation they are controlled by the DP control, that\nmeasures the wind and wave forces to find the necessary force that each thruster should\nreceive to keep the PSV steady.\n\nThe generators will change their operation point to support the variation of the load\ncaused by the step.As can be seen on Figure 30, the step is applied at 10 seconds, approx-\nimately, it causes a variation on the frequency, even though the drop on the frequency\nlevel is deep it does not reach the limit of 47.5 Hz, a smaller variation on the reactive\npower causes a variation on the voltage level, that almost reaches the limit of 0.9 pu.\nAfter the step application, starts a moment that is similar in power to the DP operation\nin this moment the load variations cause a perceptible variation on the voltage and on\nthe frequency levels.\n\n\n\n68 Chapter 4.

Since the loads are connected at the same moment for all cases this period\nthat the generators take to reach the power demand are supported by the batteries it\ncauses a reduction on the State of Charge(SOC) that shows, in percentage, the amount\nof energy that the battery still has. As can be seen the case, on which was applied the\nwashout filter approach has a significant reduction on the SOC level when the step was\n\n\n\n4.6.

As said\n\n\n\n70 Chapter 4. Power Generation Control\n\nbefore the inverter control was designed to control active and reactive power, controlling\nboth powers the inverter helps on the voltage and frequency levels. Looking to the upper\nvoltage level we can say that both approaches present good results, for the case without\nbattery the maximum voltage level reaches 1.04 pu. Looking to the voltage drop on\nFigure 32 even though the voltage drop is reduced when the Variable mean approach,\nthe washout filter also presents the best results when the voltage levels are analysed, the\nvariation on voltage is significantly smaller when we compare to the variable mean or to\nthe without battery case.\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nG\ne\n\nn\ne\n\nr\na\n\nto\nr\ns\n\nR\ne\n\na\nc\nti\nv\ne\n\n P\no\n\nw\ne\n\nr\n\n(\nM\n\nV\nA\n\nR\n)\n\nWashout\n\nVariable Mean\n\nWithout Battery\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nL\no\n\na\nd\n\nR\ne\n\na\nc\nti\nv\ne\n\n P\no\n\nw\ne\n\nr\n\n(\nM\n\nV\nA\n\nR\n)\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nB\na\n\ntt\ne\n\nr\ny\n\nR\ne\n\na\nc\nti\nv\ne\n\n P\no\n\nw\ne\n\nr\n\n(\nM\n\nV\nA\n\nR\n)\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n\nTime [s]\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.1\n\nV\no\n\nlt\na\n\ng\ne\n\n(\np\n\nu\n)\n\nDP Operation\n\nFigure 32 \u2013 Reactive power , state of charge and voltage results of a load step response for cases with\nand without battery.\n\nFrom the analysis of both techniques with the case without batteries we can see that\nthe batteries help the system to keep the voltage and frequency closer to their reference\npoints, 1 pu and 50 Hz, respectively. Contrasting both techniques we find that the washout\nfilter presents the best results.\n\n\n\n4.6. Peak Shaving 71\n\n4.6.3 Results for Diesel Consumption\n\nThe consumption curve of both diesel engines is shown on Figure25. As can be seen\nfrom Figure25 the point on which the engines operate have a higher importance on the\nconsumption and emission, that is strongly connected to consumption.\n\nThe following calculations are done by focusing on the DP operation, from 30s to 60s\nof the simulation performed. In order to calculate the amount of diesel consumed, we first\ndetermine that the diesel used was the Marine Fuel Oil, that has a volumetric density is\n0.97 kg/liter, then we plotted a curve comparing energy x consumption(liters/hour) and\nintegrated the value for the simulation between 12 and 60 seconds.\n\n0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\nGenerator Power\n\n(MW)\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nD\nie\n\nse\nl C\n\no\nn\nsu\n\nm\np\ntio\n\nn\n(L\n\n/k\nW\n\ns)\n\nDiesel Consumption Curve\nWithout Battery\nVariable Mean\n\n0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\nGenerator Power\n\n(MW)\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nD\nie\n\nse\nl C\n\no\nn\nsu\n\nm\np\ntio\n\nn\n(L\n\n/k\nW\n\ns)\n\nDiesel Consumption Curve\nWithout Battery\nWashout Filter\n\nFigure 33 \u2013 Consumption for both approaches compared to the without battery case.\n\nTo calculate the amount of diesel spent to charge the batteries we took the energy\nat the end of the simulation and subtracted from the energy at the beggining for both\napproaches, then we convert this difference of energy by calculating the amount of diesel\nthat the diesel generator would spend to produce this energy operating at its best oper-\nation point, and we sum this diesel amount to the total diesel amount spent during the\nlast 30 seconds of simulation.\n\n\n\n72 Chapter 4.

Firstly, the analysis done on section 4.6 assume that the\nbatteries are used to cover the variations of power demand whereas the generators operate\nat a mean calculated by the approaches. Moreover the governors are responsible to control\nfrequency, the AVR are responsible to control voltage and the battery inverter controls\n\n\n\n4.7. Frequency Control via Battery 73\n\nthe active and reactive power required from the batteries, this power control also helps\non reducing the frequency and voltage variations, even though it was not designed for it.\n\nThe control shown on Figure 34, has full responsibility on the frequency control, since\nthere are no governors, on the other hand, voltage control is divided between the average\nvoltage regulator and the battery inverter control. To do the frequency control, a delta\nfrequency between the measured frequency and 50 Hz is multiplied by a frequency gain\n?? , it is divided by 1.5 * ?? resulting in ????? that is subtracted by ??????????. The result of\nthis subtraction pass through a PI control that integrates the error. To create a reference\nsignal in the d axis, the output of the PI control is summed to the ??????????, subtracted\nby the multiplication of the ?????????? by ? * ?????, and then multiplied by 2/??? . ?\ncomes from 2 * ? * ? ???????? and the measured signals on d and q axes are obtained\nby measuring voltage and frequency on abc axes and transforming them using the park\ntransformation to the dq axis. Moreover frequency measured is obtained by using a Phase\nLocked Loop (PLL) that measures frequency and angle from a signal on the abc axes.\n\nwLgrid\n\nId_ref\n\nIq_ref\n\nId_measured\n\nVDC\nmq\n\nmd\nVref_dq\n\nVd_measured\n\n2\n\nX\n\ngf\n\nFrequency\n\nmeasured\n\n(Hz)\n\n50 Hz PI+\n-\n\n+\n-\n\nIq_measured\n\n+\n-XX\n\nX\n\nVd\n\n3/2\n\nX\n\nX\n\nVd\n\n3/2\n\nPI +\n-\n\n+\n\nPI +\n+\n\n+\n\nVq_measured\n\nwLgrid\nX\n\nX\n\ngv\n\nVoltage\n\nmeasured\n\n(pu)\n\n1 pu PI+\n-\n\nFigure 34 \u2013 Battery Inverter Control Scheme for Optimal Point.\n\nTo do the voltage control, the steps are almost the same but on the q axis, a delta\nvoltage between the measured voltage, in pu, and 1 pu is multiplied by a voltage gain ??,\nit is divided by 1.5 * ?? resulting in ????? that is subtracted by ??????????. The result of this\nsubtraction pass through a PI control that integrates the error. The difference between d\nand q axes control comes here, to create a reference signal in the q axis, the output of the\nPI control is summed to the ??????????, summed by the multiplication of the ?????????\nby ? * ?????, and then multiplied by 2/??? .\n\nThe reference signal in d and q axes are then combined and are transformed back to\nabc axes, the signal on abc axes is sent to a PWM that generates a signal to control the\nbattery inverter.\n\nThe values of PI control for the inner loop and of ????? were determined firstly using\nthe method shown on [71]. After that, the values of ?? , ?? and of the PI control for the\n\n\n\n74 Chapter 4. Power Generation Control\n\nupper loop were obtained by an iterative method.\n\n4.7.1 Frequency and Voltage analysis for generators operating\nat fixed points\n\nAs said before the following results contemplate the operation of the generators at\nfixed points closer to the diesel generator optimal point, the points tested were chosen\nbased on the investigation of the diesel consumption curve shown on Figure25,0.8 pu and\n0.9 pu.\n\nAs can be seen from Figure 35, the period on which the PSV is pursuing the loading in\nport mission, requiring a lower amount of load from the generators, is used to charge the\nbatteries in both operational points. From 0 to 30 seconds in both analysis, 0.8 and 0.9\npu, there is only one diesel generator providing power to the system, as can be seen the\nbattery charges more when the generators operate at 0.9. At 30 seconds the load demand\nstarts to ramp up, this increase on load demand lasts until 42 seconds, moment that the\nloads achieve the maximum demand required in the laden voyage, which is the worst case\nfor frequency and voltage control. From 30 to 42 seconds the batteries provide power to\nthe system to keep the frequency steady at 50Hz, when we compare the frequency data of\nthe Figure 35 to the Figure 26 we can see that this power injection reduces the variation\non frequency, this power injection has a considerable reflection on the state of charge of\nthe battery that reduces during this period. From 42 to 80 seconds, as mentioned before\nthe ship is pursuing the laden voyage, as can be seen from the graphic of battery active\npower during this period operating the generators at 0.9 pu cover the demand required\nfrom the loads and the battery is slightly charged, negative value on power shows that,\non the other hand operating the diesel generators at 0.8 pu is not enough to cover the\nload demand, in this case the battery also provides power, maintaining the frequency at\n50 Hz, it can be seen from the battery active power curve on which the levels for the\n0.8 analysis are positive, that represents a discharging of the battery also shown on the\nbattery state of charge curve.\n\nThe battery used on this analysis as said before is represented by a voltage source\nin series with a resistance, it does not have limit on power and the state of charge was\nmodelled integrating the power provided from the batteries through the period of the\nsimulation. The maximum capacity of the battery is 80 MWs and in both cases the battery\nstarted with 51% that represents 40.8 MWs of energy available during the simulation.\nDuring the simulation the simulation the battery reaches a maximum state of charge\naround 72%, when the generators operate at 0.9 pu, this configuration also leads to a\nfinal state of charge of 51%. On the other hand when operating the generators at 0.8 pu,\nleads to a maximum energy about 66%, at the end of the simulation the state of charge\nreaches 14%.\n\n\n\n4.7.

The dashed line on\nfrequency results means the limits of the PN-IEC-60092-101 for frequency.\n\nAnalysing frequency and voltage on Figures 35 and 36 can be seen that the frequency\nvaries between 49.85 Hz and 50.15 Hz a maximum variation of 0.30%. Furthermore,\nvoltage level varies between 1.009 and 0.991, a maximum variation of 0.9%.

The dashed line on\nvoltage results means the limits of the PN-IEC-60092-101 for voltage.\n\nFrom Figure 24, we can see that the bus-tie mentioned is shown in blue. As can be\nseen from Table 7 the operation with the bus-tie closed already reduces in 1.62% the\ndiesel consumed, the ??2 and the ? ?? emitted. Keep the generators steady at 0.8 pu\nand 0.9 pu with the help of the batteries increases its reduction, reaching 5.97% for the\ngenerators operating at 0.8 pu and 6.48% for the generators operating at 0.9 pu. It could\nbe foreseen from the analysis of the diesel consumption curve shown on Figure 25.\n\n\n\n4.7. Frequency Control via Battery 77\n\nThe third column of table 7 shows the results of the sum of the diesel consumed\nduring the whole simulation (80 seconds) to the diesel spent to charge the batteries until\nits initial SoC (20.1%) as can be seen when we sum the diesel amount necessary to charge\nthe battery, the operation spends more diesel than the operation with bus-tie opened.\nThe fourth column of table 7 shows the outcomes of each case compared to the basis\ncase, bus-tie opened, when the initial and final battery SoC are considered, both SoC\nare converted to diesel, taking into account that to produce this amount of energy was\nused one diesel generator operating at its optimal point, doing that if the battery SoC\nincreases during the operation, the delta diesel between initial and end of the operation\nis then subtracted from the diesel consumed during the operation, on the contrary if the\nbattery SoC decreases, the delta diesel is then summed to the diesel consumed during the\noperation. This approach was assumed since the higher the battery SoC the longer the\nperiod of time that the diesel generator can remain disconnected saving diesel in a future\noperation.\n\nTable 7 \u2013 Diesel Consumption - Negative values represent an increase of consumption\n\nCase\n\nReduction on\nDiesel\n\nConsumed\n(liters)\n\nReduction on\nTotal Diesel\nConsumed\n\nbattery charge\n+ operation\n\n(liters)\n\nReduction on\nTotal Diesel\nConsumed\n\nbattery SoC (final-initial)\n+ operation\n\n(liters)\nBus-Tie Opened ? ? ?\nBus-Tie Closed 13.91% 13.91% 13.91%\nGenerators at 0.8 pu 17.72% -1.17% 4.24%\nGenerators at 0.9 pu 18.16% -0.93% 17.86%\n\nTable 8 \u2013 ??2 and ? ??

Power Generation Control\n\n\n\n79\n\nChapter 5\nDiscussion of the Results and Future\n\nWorks\n\nThis chapter aimed to comprise the results of different analysis of the ship electrical\npower system, it started showing on section 4.5 that the discussions on operating with\nthe bus-tie opened or closed must continue since there is a considerable gain in operating\nwith the bus-tie closed, this gain should be also followed by the safety that ships have\nwhen operate with the bus-tie opened, this gain could be higher if the DP operation was\nanalysed, it can be a future work to be performed when the international societies firm\nthe requirements to run the DP operation with the bus-tie closed. As sections 4.6 and\n4.7 presented before batteries can help to control or even take full control of frequency,\nmoreover batteries can help to reduce diesel consumption and GHG emissions by keeping\nthe generators operating closer to their optimal point, it is reinforced in 4.6 by showing\nthat using batteries in peak shaving may not save diesel if the generators are operated\nwith low load.\n\nLooking for frequency and voltage is shown in 4.6 that the strategy adopted to increase\nthe load demand also influences the variations of frequency and voltage. It can be seen\nthat the washout filter approach presents the best results.\n\nFinally, in 4.7 is shown that there is a considerable reduction of diesel consumption and\nGHG emission by operating the diesel generators closer to their optimal point. Moreover\nit is shown that operate the diesel generators at 0.9 pu can lead to a higher reduction if\nwe consider that the energy stored on the battery can be used to disconnect one generator\nand then save diesel.\n\nFuture works can be dedicated to perform the same analysis to other ships that have\na higher load demand. Another study can be done on substituting the AC grid to a DC\ngrid, it can integrates better the batteries and can also helps to save diesel since variable\nspeed engines does not have to control frequency, running at their optimal speed that\nprovide power enough to meet the load demand. Moreover the curve of fuel consumption\nfor variable speed engines have a lower variation range, it also helps on operation that\n\n\n\n80 Chapter 5. Discussion of the Results and Future Works\n\nrequires substantial variations of load. Substitution of diesel engines per dual fuel engines\nor per gas turbines are also fields of study that demand more deepening.\n\n\n\n81\n\nBibliography\n\n[1] European Parliament, \u201cEmission reduction targets for international aviation and\nshipping,\u201d Tech.
