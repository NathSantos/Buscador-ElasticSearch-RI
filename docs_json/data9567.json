Transportation sector is the bigger consumer of oil. \nFaced with the actual scenario a renewable and sustenable alternative is \nneeded, not just to decrease our dependence of petroleum but also to base our \npower in a renewable source. Biodiesel is at the forefront of the alternatives to \npetroleum based fuels in the transportation sector, being considered an \nimportant short-time option since its price can be competitive with conventional \ndiesel and no motor changes are required. Biodiesel consists on a liquid blend \nof, non toxic, biodegradable fatty acid esters, with non sulfur and aromatic \ncontent, good lubricity, high cetane number, nontoxic character of their exhaust \nemissions and cleaner burning. \nAiming at tuning biodiesel to optimize the fuel composition, the present work \ncontributes for a better knowledge of de depencende of thermophysical \nproperties of biodiesel on their compositon. New data is required to help in the \ndevelopment of reliable models to predict biodiesel behavior. \nDensity and viscosity data are a mirror of biodiesel composition, as both \ndepend on the raw material, more than the production process. New data of \ndensity and viscosity were measured and respective models were tested and \ncompared, and new adjusted parameters proposed for this family of \ncompounds. The measured data include a wide range of temperatures and in \nthe case of density data were also measured at high pressure for biodiesel and \nsome pure methyl esters. \nThis work also reports experimental data for the solid-liquid-phase equilibria of \nbiodiesel and, liquid-liquid equilibria of some important systems in biodiesel \nproduction. Both type of equilibria were described with models developed in \nour laboratory. \nA special importance is here given to properties that depend on fatty acid \nprofile of raw material besides density and viscosity; the iodine value, and cold \nfilter plugging point are here evaluated based on norm considerations. \nFree Fatty Acids (FFA) are a by-product in edible oil refining, that are removed \nin the deodorizing step on oil purification. Enzymatic catalysis is here studied \nas an alternative to convert this by-product into biodiesel. The ability of \nimmobilized lipase from Candida antartica (Novozym 435) to catalize the \nesterification of FFA with methanol and ethanol were evaluated using response \nsurface methodology with an experimental design. Influence of several \nvariables were evaluated in the yield of reaction. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIndex \n\n \n\nGENERAL CONTEXT ....................................................................................................... 1 \n\nWork Aims and Motivations ................................................................................ 3 \n\nDocument Organization ........................................................................................ 4 \n\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION .......................................................................................... 7 \n\nSECTION 1 THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES AND PHASE EQUILIBRIA ..... 27 \n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 CHAPTER 1 DENSITY AND VISCOSITY .............................................................. 33 \n\nDensities and Viscosities of Fatty Acid Methyl and Ethyl Esters ................... 39 \n\nDensities and Viscosities of Minority Fatty Acid Methyl and Ethyl Esters \n\nPresent in Biodiesel ............................................................................................. 63 \n\nBiodiesel Density: Experimental Measurements and Prediction Models ...... 81 \n\nHigh-Pressure Biodiesel Density: Experimental Measurements, Correlation \n\nand CPA EoS Modeling .................................................................................... 103 \n\nEvaluation of predictive models for the Viscosity of biodiesel ...................... 133 \n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 CHAPTER 2  LOW TEMPERATURE BEHAVIOUR .......................................... 157 \n\nMeasurement and Modelling of Biodiesel Cold Flow Properties.................. 161 \n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 CHAPTER 3  BIODIESEL PROPERTIES VS COMPOSITION ......................... 183 \n\nDependency of the Biodiesel Properties on its Composition ......................... 185 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 CHAPTER 4  WATER SOLUBILITY IN BIODIESELS AND FATTY ACIDS 205 \n\nDescription of the mutual solubilities of fatty acids and water with the CPA \n\nEoS ...................................................................................................................... 209 \n\nAnother look at the water solubility in biodiesels: Further experimental \n\nmeasurements and prediction with the CPA EoS .......................................... 239 \n\nSECTION 2  ENZYMATIC  SYNTHESIS OF BIODIESEL ..................................... 259 \n\nEnzymatic Biodiesel Production using Novozyme 435 as a catalyst ............ 263 \n\nGENERAL CONCLUSIONS ......................................................................................... 289 \n\nIDEAS TO THE FUTURE ............................................................................................. 293 \n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY ........................................................................................................... 295 \n\nAPPENDIX A .................................................................................................................. 301 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGeneral Context \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWith the depletion of oil resources as well as the negative environmental impact \n\nassociated with the use of fossil fuels, there is a renewed interest in alternative energy \n\nsources. Since the world reserves of fossil fuels and raw materials are limited, active \n\nresearch interest has been focusing in nonpetroleum, renewable, and nonpolluting fuels. \n\nBiofuels are one of the most important alternative source of energy for the foreseeable \n\nfuture and can still form the basis of sustainable development in terms of socioeconomic \n\nand environmental concerns. Biodiesel appears to be a promising future energy \n\nsources.1 \n\n \n\nWork Aims and Motivations \n\n \n\nBiodiesel derived from oil crops is a potential renewable and carbon neutral alternative \n\nto petroleum fuels. Chemically, biodiesel is a monoalkyl ester of long chain fatty acids \n\nderived from renewable feed stock like vegetable oils and animal fats. It is obtained by \n\nthe transesterification reaction between oil or fat and a monohydric alcohol in presence \n\nof a catalyst. Biodiesel has to fulfill quality standards which are compiled in the norm \n\nthat specify minimum or maximum requirements and test methods to evaluate biodiesel \n\nquality. In Europe the biodiesel fuel standards are compiled in the norm CEN EN \n\n14214, and in USA in the norm ASTM D6751. Some of these properties depend on the \n\nraw materials used on the biodiesel fuel production and as a consequence on the fatty \n\nacid esters profile of biodiesel fuel. Differences in chemical and physical properties \n\namong biodiesel fuels can be explained largely by the fuels\u2019 fatty acid content. \n\nFor technical reasons, political and economic production of biodiesel obeying the \n\nrequired quality standards cannot be made from one single oil but only from mixtures of \n\noils. The main goal of this work is to develop relations between the oils composition \n\nand the final characteristics of the biodiesel which indicate the most appropriated \n\nformulation for a biodiesel fuel. Nevertheless, the environmental conditions can limit \n\nbiodiesel utilization, as some specific norm parameters differ between regions and \n\nseasons (winter and summer). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nThis work was motivated by the lack of information on the thermophysical properties \n\nof biodiesel fuel and their dependency on the fuel composition. Unlike diesel fuels, \n\nbiodiesels are composed by a limited number of compounds, which allows the study of \n\nthe properties of each individual compound and the development of relationships \n\nbetween them and the fuel properties. It was thus necessary to study the thermophysical \n\nproperties of the components of biodiesel, namely methyl and ethyl esters of long \n\nsaturated and unsaturated alkyl chains (C8-C22). In this work the focus was on the \n\ndensities and viscosities of the biodiesel fuels and their components. These properties \n\nwere measured not just at temperatures set in the norms, but in a wide range of \n\ntemperatures from 278K to 363K. Concerning the density the influence of pressure has \n\nbeen also studied. \n\nSome biodiesel specifications involve biodiesel performances at low temperature, but \n\nthere is little information about the low-temperature behavior of biodiesel fuels. To \n\novercome this limitation, the liquid- and solid- phase composition as well as fractions at \n\ntemperatures below the cloud point were studied. \n\nMutual solubilities of fatty acid with water and solubility of water in biodiesel were \n\nstudied due to their importance in biodiesel production and purification. Measurements \n\nwere done to help the development of models to describe the phase equilibria with \n\nwater. \n\nThe possibility of using residual fatty acids, obtained in the process of deodorization \n\nof edible oils as raw material in fatty acid ester production was also studied. Given the \n\nlimitations of both basic and acid catalysis on this process, enzymatic catalysis was \n\nattempted in this work using a commercial lipase from Novozymes. \n\n \n\n \n\nDocument Organization \n\nDuring these last four years of investigation in Biodiesel Fuels several articles were \n\nproduced and published in several international journals. Developed work will be \n\npresented through a collection of all produced papers. They are compiled in chapters \n\naccording to their subjects and in the following order: \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nSection 1: Thermodynamic Properties and Phase Equilibria \n\nChapter 1 Density and viscosity \n\n1.

Worldwide energy consumption is \n\nprojected to grow by 53 percent between 2008 and 2035, with much of the increase \n\ndriven by strong economic growth in the developing nations especially China and India. \n\nIn European Union (EU) energy consumption is expected to level out in future but \n\nworld energy consumption will continue to grow due to global population growth and \n\neconomic catching up as shown in Figure 1.1 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1- World energy demand.1(Mtoe - Million tonnes of oil equivalent) \n\n \n\n \n\nThe EU energy mix is slowly changing. Fossil fuels still represent up to 80% of the \n\nenergy mix today. In a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d scenario, the share may still be 70% by 2030, \n\nbut renewable sources are expected to account for an increasing proportion (Figure2).2,3 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nFigure 2- EU gross inland consumption in 2008 and a prediction for 2030\n\n \n\nEnergy powers our society and economy\n\nhalf of the total final energy\n\nhouseholds (Figure 3). \n\nFigure 3- Final energy consumption\n\n \n\n \n\nOil\n\n36.5%\n\nRenewa\n\nble\n\n8.4%\n\nCoal, \n\n17.0%\n\nNuclear, \n\n13.4%\n\nOther, \n\n0.2%\n\nin % (1799 Mtoe; 2008) \n\nHouseholds\n\nEU gross inland consumption in 2008 and a prediction for 2030\n\nEnergy powers our society and economy.

Oil is becoming increasingly \n\nscarce and soon will not be able to meet the numerous demands, arising mainly from the \n\ntransport sector. Decline of available oil reserves and more stringent environmental \n\nregulations have motivated the global interest in other energy sources. But there are \n\nother ways of fueling our cars??? That question has already been answered: \u201cThe use of \n\nvegetable oils for engine fuels may seem insignificant today. But such oils may become \n\nin the course of time as important as the petroleum and coal tar products of the present \n\ntime\u201c. This sentence could be pronounced today, but I am quoting Rudolf Diesel which \n\nhad such a visionary idea in 1900. The concept of using alternative, renewable energy \n\nwas demonstrated by the German engineer at World Exhibition in Paris, the first diesel \n\nengine using peanut oil as fuel. The engine was built for petroleum and was used with \n\nthe vegetable oil without any change. In this case also, the consumption experiments \n\nresulted in heat utilization identical to petroleum.4 \n\nThe extremely low cost of mineral oils and their abundant supply made research and \n\ndevelopment activities on vegetable oil not seriously pursued. These activities only \n\nreceived attention recently when it was realized that petroleum fuels were dwindling \n\nfast and environment-friendly renewable substitutes ought to be identified. \n\nFaced with the energy crisis and environmental degradation, due to the massive use of \n\nfossil energy sources, biodiesel became an attractive alternative to diesel fuel. \n\nIn 2001, the European Commission adopted a policy to promote biofuels for \n\ntransport, and a number of targets were set. The integrated energy and climate change \n\nstrategy agreed at the end of 2008 foresees the share of renewable (such as biofuels) in \n\ntotal fuel consumption rising to at least 10 % by 2020, percentage in energy value.5 \n\nBiodiesel production has increased exponentially in the last decade; from worldwide \n\nnegligible productions in 1990 its production reached over 2500 million tons in 2008 \n\nbeing biodiesel the most used biofuel in Europe.6 \n\nBiofuels are a renewable source of energy that may be described as 'carbon neutral' as \n\nshown in Figure 4. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4- Biodiesel cycle.7 \n\n \n\nBiodiesel fuel is seen as an alternative to the conventional petroleum based fuels in \n\nthe transportation sector, being considered as an important short-time option as its \n\nprices can be similar to petroleum based fuels and no motor changes are required, \n\nreducing the dependency on fossil fuels and controlling green house gases emissions.4 \n\nBiodiesel fuel advantages and applications are well established as described.4,8-14         \n\nAs a fuel it offers many benefits such as ready availability, portability, renewability, \n\ndomestic origin, lower sulfur and aromatic content, biodegradability, better ignition \n\nquality, inherent lubricity, higher cetane number, positive energy balance, higher \n\ndensity, greater safety, nontoxic character of their exhaust emissions and cleaner \n\nburning.15-18     \n\nGasoline and diesel come in the category of non-renewable fuel and will last for a \n\nlimited period of time. Another important point is that carbon contained in the fossil \n\nfuel deposits was removed from the atmosphere millions of years ago and has been \n\nlocked up within Earth's crust ever since. When this fossil carbon is put back into the \n\natmosphere as a result of burning fossil fuels, it represents a new input of carbon into \n\nthe modern atmosphere. These non-renewable fuels also emit pollutants in the form of \n\noxides of nitrogen, oxides of sulphur, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, lead, \n\nhydrocarbons, etc. during their processing and use.19 Table 1 presents a brief description \n\nof advantages and disadvantages of the use of biodiesel fuels. \n\n \n\n \n\nOilseeds\n\nSeeds\n\nCrude vegetal oil\n\nRefined vegetal oil\n\nAlcohol\n\nGlycerine\n\nVehicles\n\nEnergy\n\nCO2Photosynthesis\n\nTransesterification\n\nBiodiesel\n\nExtraction\n\nRefinement\n\nSun\n\nEnergy\n\nRenewable\n\nResources\n\nCrop Refinig\n\nBiodiesel \n\nProduction\n\nRenwable Fuel\n\nCO2\n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\nTable 1- Advantages and disadvantages of biodiesel fuels. 4, 11, 19-20 \n\n \n\nAdvantages Disadvantages \n\n?Mitigation of greenhouse gas \n\nemissions, considered carbon neutral. \n\n?Biodiesel gels in cold weather, \n\nproblems at low temperatures \n\n?Renewable, biodegradable, non toxic ?Higher NOx Emissions \n\n?Reduce CO, hydrocarbons and \n\nparticles in exhaust emission; do not \n\ncontain Sulfur (reduction of air pollution \n\nand related public health risks) \n\n?Competition between food and \n\nBiodiesel, food shortages and increased \n\nfood price \n\n?Higher cetane number than standard \n\ndiesel \n\n?Lower calorific power than standard \n\ndiesel \n\n?Easily blended with standard diesel ?Biodiesel has around 11% less energy \n\ncontent compared to standard petroleum \n\ndiesel \n?Higher lubricity \n\n?Useable in standard diesel engines with \n\nlittle or no engine or fuel system \n\nmodification (in contrast to other \u201ceco-\n\nfuels\u201d such as hydrogen) \n\n?Affect biodiversity as countries will \n\nsacrifice their rainforests to build more \n\noil plantations (non-sustainable biofuel \n\nproduction) \n\n?Safer to handle and store due to higher \n\nflash point than petro-diesel \n\n?Susceptible to water contamination and \n\nbacteriological growth \n\n?Reduce dependence on foreign \n\npetroleum, improve energy security and \n\nenergy independence, benefiting \n\n\u201cdomestic\u201d economy \n\n?Biodiesel degrades the rubber seals in \n\nengines previous than 1996 \n\n \n\nHaving on view the various pro\u2019s and con\u2019s presented in Table 1, no wonder the \n\nnumber of studies related to biodiesel has grown exponentially in recent years, as shown \n\nin the Figure 5. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5- Exponential increase of publication number per year since 2000 related to \n\n\u201cbiodiesel\u201d theme (based on a search in ISI Web of Knowledge with papers, abstracts \n\nand patents included). \n\n \n\nBiodiesel refers to the pure fuel before blending with neat diesel fuel, namely B100. \n\nBiodiesel blends are denoted as \u201cBXX\u201d with \u201cXX\u201d representing the percentage of \n\nbiodiesel contained in the blend e.g., B20 is 20% of biodiesel, 80% of petroleum diesel. \n\nUse of biodiesel can greatly benefit the environment by reducing emissions. Using \n\nbiodiesel instead of conventional diesel reduces emissions such as the overall life cycle \n\nof carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides \n\n(SOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and unburned hydrocarbons. However, \n\nwhile reducing the aforementioned types of emissions, nitrogen oxides (NOx) \n\nemissions, mostly NO and NO2, are increased. NOx is formed at high temperature in the \n\ncombustion chamber when oxygen and nitrogen combination occurs. This type of NOx \n\nis generally formed during fuel combustion such as gas or diesel. Nevertheless the \n\ncombustion of biodiesel needs more energy (as oxygen represents in mass 11% of \n\nbiodiesel) and consequently higher temperatures that promote the increase of NOx.\n21 \n\nFigure 6 shows the impact that biodiesel-diesel blends have on emissions. \n\nPhotography was taken one minute after start the light, as 4 minutes late in diesel lamp \n\nit was impossible to see the flame. \n\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011\n\n51 65 72\n136 157\n\n261\n\n462\n\n867\n\n1375\n\n1904\n\n2193\n\n4350\n\nNumber of publications per year\n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6- Variation in emissions when substitutes diesel fuel by biodiesel.21 \n\n \n\n \n\nAs already mentioned chemically the biodiesel is a fuel comprised of mono-alkyl \n\nesters of long chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils, animal fats, or mixtures of \n\nthem. It is usually produced by the transesterification reaction of triglycerides with a \n\nshort chain alcohol, generally methanol or ethanol, in presence of a catalyst, leading to \n\nthe formation of mixtures of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) or fatty acid ethyl esters \n\n(FAEEs) respectively.4, 14 The stoichiometry requires 3 mol of alcohol and 1 mol of \n\ntriglyceride to give 3 mol of fatty acid esters and 1 mol of glycerine, as shown in Figure \n\n7, where R1, R2 and R3 are alkyl chains derived from fatty acids, which most common \n\nare presented in Table 2, R4 is the alcohol alkyl chain.\n19 22 23 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7- Transesterification reaction for biodiesel production. \n\n \n\nThe transesterification reaction consists of a sequence of reversible reactions that \n\noccurs in three different steps, in the presence of an alcohol (A). In the first step, \n\ntriglycerides (TG) are converted to diglycerides (DG) which get converted to \n\n- Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)   - Particulate Matter (PM)    - Carbon Monoxide (CO)   - Hydrocarbons (HC)\n\nDIESEL B100\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\nmonoglycedies (MG) in the next step. In the third and last step monoglycerides are \n\nconverted to glycerol (G). A mole of esters is liberated at each step, normally namely \n\nfatty acid methyl esters (FAME). Thus three FAMEs are obtained from one \n\ntriglycerides molecule.19 Equation [1] to [3] summarizes the reaction of \n\ntransesterification. \n\n \n\n?? + ? 0\n??\n\t\n\n?? \n? + ????

The reactions are reversible, although the equilibrium lies towards the \n\nproduction of fatty acid esters and glycerol. Figure 8 shows the concentration profiles of \n\nall components until equilibrium is reached, based in reactions described. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8- Simulated concentration profile of glycerol (G), tri-glyceride (TG), di-\n\nglyceride (DG), mono-glyceride (MG) and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) during \n\ntransesterification.19 \n\n \n\nThe transesterification can be performed using alkaline, acid, or enzymatic catalysts. \n\nAt industrial scale alkaline catalysis reaction is worldwide used; while acid and \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\nenzymatic catalysis have little or no expression. The acid catalysis is slower and \n\nrequires higher temperatures; while the enzymatic catalysis suffers from the enzymes \n\nbeing too expensive.24 \n\nThere are also two noncatalyzed transesterification processes, namely BIOX process \n\nand supercritical alcohol process. The BIOX process developed in Canada uses inert co-\n\nsolvents that generate an oil-rich one-phase system and with 99% of yield in seconds at \n\nambient temperature.25 The supercritical methanol reacts with the oil as a single phase \n\nreaction, the process involves much simpler purification of products, has lower reaction \n\ntime.26 \n\nIn alkaline catalysis of biodiesel several factors affect the transesterification reaction \n\nas the type of catalyst, the alcohol/oil molar ratio, temperature, the reagents purity, the \n\namount of free fatty acids, the alcohol used and the mixing, as this is a two phase \n\nreaction.23,27 \n\nMethanol is the preferred alcohol due to its low cost, physical and chemical \n\nadvantages in the process.23 Nevertheless, ethanol can prevail in regions where it is less \n\nexpensive than methanol, due to its easier production and accessibility28, and higher \n\nchain alcohols have as well been suggested.29,30 Moreover, the process is easy to control \n\nand biodiesel purification easier with methanol than with heavier alcohols.31 An excess \n\nof alcohol is necessary in order to displace the transesterification reaction towards \n\nproduct creation.23 After the reaction is complete, two major products form: glycerin \n\nand biodiesel. The glycerin phase is denser than the biodiesel phase and the two can be \n\ngravity separated. \n\nThe basic catalyst is typically sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. As alkali-\n\ncatalyzed systems are very sensitive to both water and free fatty acid (FFA) content, the \n\nglycerides and alcohol must be substantially anhydrous because the water promotes a \n\nsecondary reaction, saponification, which produces soaps, thus consuming the catalyst \n\nand reducing the catalyst efficiency, as well as causing an increase in viscosity, and \n\ndifficulty in separations.23 Figure 9 shows a flow chart of alkaline catalysis of biodiesel. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\nFigure 9 \u2013 Flow chart of biodiesel alkaline transesterification.\n\n \n\nThe typical industrial biodiesel production and \n\nFigure 10 and can be described as follows: the reaction takes place in a multiphase \n\nreactor where an oil reacts with an alcohol, in presence of a\n\nfatty acid esters and glycerol.\n\nthe outlet of the reactor two liquid phases co\n\nfatty acid esters.

Viscosities and densities are \n\ntwo of the main properties evaluated in this work which will depend on the raw \n\nmaterials used on the biodiesel fuel production and in consequence on the profile of \n\nmethyl or ethyl esters of the biodiesel fuel.36 \n\nDensity data are relevant because injection systems, pumps and injectors must deliver \n\nthe amount of fuel precisely adjusted to provide a proper combustion.42 Boudy and \n\nSeers43,44 showed that the fuel density is the main property that influences the amount of \n\nmass injected. The viscosity is required not only for the design of pipes, fittings and \n\nequipment to be used in industry of oil and fuel45, but also for monitoring the quality of \n\nfuel itself to be used in diesel engines. A viscous fuel, causing a poorer atomization, \n\nwhich is the first step of combustion, is responsible for premature injector cooking and \n\npoor fuel combustion.43,46 \n\nMany studies have been devoted to the measurement and prediction of the density and \n\nviscosity of biodiesel fuel as function of temperature. Being able to predict those \n\nproperties is of high relevance for the correct formulation of an adequate blend of raw \n\nmaterials that optimize the cost of biodiesel fuel production while allowing the fuel to \n\nmeet the required quality standards. \n\nInside Section 1 the work addressing the low temperature behavior and phase \n\nequilibria of biodiesel are also presented. The biodiesel cold flow performance depends \n\nboth on the oil and alcohol used in the transesterification. A biodiesel with a large \n\nconcentration of saturated fatty acid esters, although less vulnerable to oxidation and \n\ndisplaying better combustion properties, has a worst performance at low temperatures \n\nbecause of its tendency to crystallize.47 This work reports experimental data for the \n\nsolid-liquid-phase equilibria of biodiesel modelled with the UNIQUAC model. \n\nIn the biodiesel production process, the fatty esters rich current coming from the \n\nreactor is saturated with glycerol, alcohol, catalyst and unreacted soaps. This current is \n\nwashed in a liquid-liquid extractor in counter current with acidified water to neutralize \n\nthe catalyst and to convert soaps to free fatty acids. The raffinate current is composed of \n\nwater saturated biodiesel while the extract is a low pH aqueous solution containing the \n\npolar compounds33. The design and optimization of the purification of biodiesel with \n\nwater requires a model that can describe the water solubility in biodiesel and mutual \n\nsolubility of fatty acid + water systems. In this work new experimental data was \n\nsuccessfully modelled with the Cubic-Plus-Association EoS. \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\nIn fact, in process operation and optimization the use of predictive models for \n\nbiodiesel fuel properties could be a most useful tool. \n\nBiodiesels with different profile are synthesized and evaluated in this work; \n\nspecifically fatty acid methyl esters of soybean, rapeseed, palm oils and their mixtures \n\n(binary and ternary) and also, sunflower. The properties that depend on fatty acid profile \n\nof raw material which are studied are namely density, viscosity, iodine value, and cold \n\nfilter plugging point (CFPP). \n\nIn Section 2 enzymatic catalysis is addressed. Free Fatty Acids (FFA) are a by-\n\nproduct in edible oil refining, that are removed in the deodorizing step on oil \n\npurification. The deodorization is carried not just in edible oils but also in some cases \n\nbefore alkaline catalysis in biodiesel production. Enzymatic catalysis is here studied as \n\nan alternative to convert this by-product into biodiesel. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSection 1 \n\nThermodynamic \n\nProperties and \n\nPhase Equilibria \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\n \n\nGeneral Context \n\nDensity and Viscosity are an important biodiesel parameter, with impact on fuel \n\nquality. Predicting these properties is of high relevance for a correct formulation of an \n\nadequate blend of raw materials that optimize the cost of biodiesel fuel production while \n\nallowing the produced fuel to meet the required quality standards. \n\nFor the higher FAEEs and FAMEs, the density and viscosity data for a wide range of \n\ntemperatures available in the literature, are either scarce or contradictory, limiting their \n\nuse in the development and testing of models to predict those properties for biodiesels. \n\nTo address this limitation, in this work densities and viscosities of ethyl esters and \n\nmethyl esters, present in biodiesel ranging in alkyl chain from C8 to C18, were \n\nmeasured at atmospheric pressure and temperatures from 273.15K to 363.15K, and are \n\nreported in Paper 1. Some of the minor components of biodiesel have received little \n\nattention in the past but they may have a non negligible influence on the biodiesel fuel \n\nproperties and, depending on the raw material used, these components can be present in \n\na significant concentration. In Paper 2 new density and viscosity data for the minority \n\ncomponents of biodiesel fuel such as methyl palmitoleate, methyl linolenate, methyl \n\narachidate, methyl gadoleate, methyl behenate, methyl erucate, methyl lignocerate, ethyl \n\nlinoleate, ethyl linolenate, and ethyl arachidate, at atmospheric pressure and \n\ntemperatures from 273.15K to 363.15K are presented. \n\nIn both these works, a comparison with the experimental data available and its critical \n\nevaluation is performed. Correlations of these experimental data using the equations on \n\nwhich the multicomponent models are based, a linear correlation of the densities with \n\ntemperature and the Vogel Tamman Fluch (VTF) equation for the viscosities were \n\ncarried and reported. The densities and viscosities of the pure ethyl and methyl esters \n\nhere measured were also used to evaluate the performance of three predictive models. \n\nThe group contribution method GCVOL48 was evaluated for the prediction of densities \n\nwhile the models of Ceriani et al.45,49 and Marrero and Gani50,51 were evaluated for the \n\nviscosity. The behavior of these models is compared against the data for the compounds \n\nstudied. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe capacity to correctly predict biodiesel densities is of major relevance for a correct \n\nformulation of an adequate blend of raw materials aiming at producing biodiesel \n\naccording to the required quality standards52,53 with the lowest production costs. \n\nThere are three main types of methods exist for estimating liquid densities of pure \n\ncompounds. The first type are the methods based on the corresponding states theory, \n\nsuch as the Rackett equation and the Spencer and Danner method.16,36,44,54-56      \n\nThese methods have, however, some disadvantages such as the requirement of critical \n\nproperties and since they often use experimental data adjusted parameters, they have a \n\nlimited predictive ability. The second type of methods is based on mixing rules, such as \n\nKay\u2019s57, that allow the estimation of a mixture density provide that the composition of \n\nthe fuel and the densities of the pure compounds are known. They are only applicable to \n\nsimple mixtures with a near ideal behavior. Finally, the third type is group contribution \n\nmodels that only requires the chemical structure of the desired molecule to be known to \n\nestimate the thermophysical properties, such as liquid densities. The group contribution \n\nmethod GCVOL48 is a predictive model that was shown in previous works to be able to \n\nprovide pure fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) densities descriptions within 1% \n\ndeviation. \n\nIn the work presented in Paper 3, new experimental density data was reported for ten \n\nbiodiesel samples, for which a detailed composition is presented. They were produced \n\nfrom different vegetable oils or oil blends, in our laboratory. The data covers the \n\ntemperature range from 278.15K to 373.15K at atmospheric pressure. Correlations for \n\nthe temperature dependency of the experimental data are reported and the isobaric \n\nexpansivities estimated. In this paper a comparison between Mixing Rules based in \n\ndifferent concentration units (molar, volumetric and mass fraction) are presented but the \n\naim is the comparison of the predictive capabilities of GCVOL model as well as \n\nextended CGVOL for the estimation of the density of several biodiesel. A revised \n\nversion of the GCVOL model is also proposed and evaluated. \n\nThese data, along with other data collected from literature, are used to carry out a \n\ncritical evaluation of biodiesel density predictive models. \n\nKnowledge and description of biodiesel densities as a function of pressure and \n\ntemperature are required for a proper design and optimization of common rail engines \n\ninjection systems, in order to a precisely adjusted amount of fuel be delivered to provide  \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\na proper combustion while minimizing NOx emissions42. However, in spite of its \n\nimportance, little attention has been given to high pressure densities of biodiesels and \n\nmeasurements and predictions of that property have been restricted to ambient \n\nconditions. After reporting experimental data for the atmospheric pressure temperature \n\ndependence of density for several fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters for different \n\nbiodiesels53,52, and studying the best models to predict the densities of biodiesel58, new \n\nexperimental high pressure density data were carried out for several of these pure \n\ncompounds and biodiesels. In Paper 4 new high pressure density data is reported in this \n\nwork for three fatty acid methyl esters and seven biodiesels, in the temperature range \n\n283K to 333K and from atmospheric pressure up to 45 MPa. Experimental densities \n\nwere correlated using the modified Tait-Tammann equation59 and thermodynamic \n\nproperties such as isothermal compressibilities and isobaric expansion coefficients were \n\nas well calculated and evaluated, on the temperature and pressure ranges studied. \n\nEmpirical models, like the modified Tait-Tammann equation, are the most commonly \n\nused to correlate high pressure density experimental data. In this work, a different and \n\ncompletely predictive approach was also applied, that consisted on the use of the Cubic-\n\nPlus-Association equation of state (CPA EoS) to describe the experimental data. In \n\nprevious works60 - 62 the CPA EoS was shown to be the most appropriate model to be \n\napplied to biodiesel production and purification processes. A discussion about the most \n\nappropriate CPA pure compound parameters for esters is also presented. \n\nThere is still a lack of viscosity data of biodiesel blends and biodiesel-diesel over the \n\nwhole composition range at different operational conditions of pressure and \n\ntemperature. In this regard, the use of theoretical approaches to estimate the viscosity of \n\nbiodiesel systems is of great practical interest and is presented in Paper 5. \n\nA number of works has presented predictive models and empirical equations with \n\nadjustable parameters for the viscosity of fatty acid esters. By knowing the viscosity of \n\nfatty acid esters, it is possible to determine the viscosity of biodiesel using the mixing \n\nrule suggested by Grunberg-Nissan or Hind63. Moreover there is a possibility to \n\noptimize its properties by simply changing the composition of fatty acid esters. The \n\npredictive capabilities of three models developed by Ceriani et al.64, Krisnangkura et \n\nal65. and Yuan et al.55 for the estimation of the viscosity of several biodiesel and their \n\nblends with diesel fuels were compared. A revised version of the Yuan model is also \n\nproposed and evaluated. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\n \n\nBesides density and viscosity there are other properties of biodiesel that can be \n\ndirectly related to the chemical composition of the raw material. Iodine index, CP (poor \n\npoint) and CFPP (cold filter plugging point) were studied and evaluated based on norms \n\nconsiderations. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Chapter 1 \n\nDensity and \n\nViscosity  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\n \n\nMy direct contribution for Published Papers \n\n \n\nIn first Chapter five published articles are presented, all related to new data for \n\ndensity and viscosity of biodiesel produced by myself from different oil sources, as well \n\nfor pure components present in biodiesel fuel. All data were measured with a \n\nViscometer Anton Parr Strabinger, in a wide range of temperatures. I was responsible \n\nfor experimental measurements of density and viscosity of biodiesel and pure \n\ncompounds, as well as the density modelling. High pressure density was measured on \n\ndifferent equipment at University of Vigo and the modeling with CPA was also carried \n\nby me in collaboration with Mariana Belo. Viscosity modelling was made by Samuel \n\nFreitas. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n36 \n\n \n\n \n\nExperimental section \n\nBiodiesel Synthesis \n\nEight biodiesel samples, studied in this work, were synthesized at our laboratory by a \n\ntransesterification reaction of the vegetal oils: Soybean (S), Rapeseed (R), and Palm (P), \n\nand their respective binary and ternary mixtures: Soybean+Rapeseed (SR), \n\nRapeseed+Palm (RP), Soybean+Palm (SP), and Soybean+Rapeseed +Palm (SRP) and \n\nSunflower (Sf). Transesterification reaction for all biodiesel samples was performed \n\nunder specific conditions: the molar ratio of oil/methanol used was 1:5 with 0.5% \n\nsodium hydroxide by weight of oil as catalyst, the reaction was performed at 55 \u00baC \n\nduring 24 h under methanol reflux and the reaction time chosen was adopted for \n\nconvenience in order to guarantee a complete reaction conversion of one liter of oil. \n\nRaw glycerol was removed in two steps, the first after 3 h reaction and then after 24 h \n\nreaction in a separating funnel. Figure 11 shows the biodiesel production. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11- Experimental assembly of biodiesel production. \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n \n\nBiodiesel was purified by washing with hot distilled water until a neutral pH was \n\nachieved. The biodiesel was then dried until the EN ISO 12937 limit for water was \n\nreached (less than 500 ppm of water). The water content was checked by Karl- Fischer \n\ntitration. \n\nIt is necessary to present here additional information about biodiesel synthesis, as the \n\nprocedure was adjusted during the work after testing several variables. For a correct \n\ncharacterization of biodiesel it is necessary to obtain close to 100% conversion on the \n\nreaction. This prevents the contamination of intermediate species as mono-, di-, and tri-\n\nglycerides in the biodiesel with important impacts on the fuel properties. \n\nThere are a lot of publications that report biodiesel productions in shorter times (3-4 \n\nhours of synthesis). In the beginning of the present work this method was also followed \n\nbut at some point we realized that the biodiesels did not possess a good quality level, as \n\nthe yield was less than 90%. The presence of intermediate species in biodiesel \n\ninfluences dramatically their thermodynamic properties. Viscosities data were measured \n\nin these conditions and were used as training set to test the model developed by Ceriani \n\net al.56 for the estimation of viscosity of fatty compounds and biodiesel esters as a \n\nfunction of the temperature and also to investigate the influence of small concentrations \n\nof intermediate compounds of transesterification reaction in the viscosity of \n\nbiodiesels.57  \n\nThe conditions to produce biodiesel were tuned until conversion reaction obtained \n\npresented yields of more than 96%. Therefore the reaction time was increased to a limit \n\nvalue to guarantee a complete reaction conversion. \n\n \n\nBiodiesel Characterization \n\nBiodiesel was characterized by GC-FID following the British Standard EN14103 \n\nfrom EN 142144 to know the alkyl esters composition of the samples. A Varian CP-\n\n3800 with a flame ionization detector in a split injection system with a Select\u2122 \n\nBiodiesel for FAME Column, (30 m x 0.32 mm x 0.25 \u00b5m), was used to discriminate \n\nbetween all methyl esters in analysis inclusively the polyunsaturated ones. The column \n\ntemperature was set at 120\u00baC and then programmed to increase up to 250 \u00baC, at 4 \n\n\u00baC/min. Detector and injector were set at 250\u00baC. The carrier gas was helium with a flow \n\nrate of 2 mL/min. Methyl heptadecanoate was used as internal standard.  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDensities and Viscosities of Fatty Acid Methyl and Ethyl Esters \n\nJournal of Chemistry &amp; Engineering Data 2010201020102010, 55, 3983\u20133990. \n\nDOI: 10.1021/je100042c \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\nDensities and Viscosities of Fatty Acid \n\nMethyl and Ethyl Esters \n\n \n\nMaria Jorge Pratas, Samuel Freitas, Mariana B.

Densities and viscosities were measured \n\nfor seven ethyl esters and eight methyl esters, at atmospheric pressure and temperatures \n\nfrom (273.15 to 363.15) K. A critical assessment of the measured data against the data \n\npreviously available in the literature was carried out. It is shown that the data here \n\nreported presents deviations of less than 0.15 % for densities and less than 5 % for \n\nviscosities. Correlations for the densities and viscosities with temperature are proposed. \n\nThe densities and viscosities of the pure ethyl and methyl esters here reported were used \n\nto evaluate three predictive models. The GCVOL group contribution method is shown \n\nto be able to predict densities for these compounds within 1 %. The methods of Ceriani \n\nand Meirelles (CM) and of Marrero and Gani (MG) were applied to the viscosity data. It \n\nis shown that only the first of these methods is able to provide a fair description of the \n\nviscosities of fatty acid esters. \n\nKeywords: Density, Viscosity, Methyl and Ethyl Esters, Biodiesel Fuel. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\nIn consequence of environmental, economical and also political turmoil, caused by \n\nthe excessive use and dependency of conventional petroleum based fuels the attention of \n\nseveral countries has been addressed towards the development of alternative fuels from \n\nrenewable resources.1,2 \n\nAmong those alternatives, biodiesel fuel, along with bioethanol fuel, is in the \n\nforefront of the substitutes to petroleum based fuels in the transportation sector, being \n\nconsidered as an important short-time option as its prices can be similar to petroleum \n\nbased fuels and no motor changes are required.3 \n\nBiodiesel is a fuel comprised of mono-alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived \n\nfrom vegetable oils, animal fats, or mixtures of them. It is produced by the \n\ntransesterification of triglycerides with a short chain alcohol, usually methanol or \n\nethanol, in presence of a catalyst, leading to the formation of mixtures of fatty acid \n\nmethyl esters (FAMEs) or fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) respectively.3,4 The main \n\ncomponents of biodiesel fuel are palmitate, stearate, oleate and linoleate esters.5 \n\nHowever, and depending on the raw materials used, a larger range of esters can be \n\npresent.6 \n\nThe biodiesel fuel has to fulfill a number of quality standards. In Europe the biodiesel \n\nfuel standards are compiled in the Norm CEN EN 142147, and in United States of \n\nAmerica in the Norm ASTM D67518. Norms specify minimum requirements and test \n\nmethods for biodiesel fuel to be used in diesel engines and for heating purposes, in \n\norder to increase the biodiesel fuel quality and its acceptance among consumers. \n\nViscosities and densities are two of the main properties evaluated which will depend on \n\nthe raw materials used on the biodiesel fuel production and in consequence on the \n\nprofile of methyl or ethyl esters of the biodiesel fuel.6 \n\nDensity data are relevant because injection systems, pumps and injectors must deliver \n\nthe amount of fuel precisely adjusted to provide proper combustion.9 Boudy and Seers \n\nshow that fuel density is the main property that influences the amount of mass \n\ninjected.10,11 The viscosity is required not only for the design of pipes, fittings and \n\nequipment to be used in industry of oil and fuel12, but also for monitoring the quality of \n\nfuel itself to be used in diesel engines. A viscous fuel, causing a poorer atomization, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\nwhich is the first step of combustion, is responsible for premature injector cooking and \n\npoor fuel combustion.10, 13 \n\nMany studies have been devoted to the measurement and prediction of the density and \n\nviscosity of biodiesel fuel as function of temperature. Being able to predict those \n\nproperties is of high relevance for the correct formulation of an adequate blend of raw \n\nmaterials that optimize the cost of biodiesel fuel production while allowing the fuel to \n\nmeet the required quality standards. In fact, in process operation and optimization the \n\nuse of correlative and predictive models for biodiesel fuel properties could be a most \n\nuseful tool. \n\nSeveral models have been proposed in the literature to calculate biodiesel fuel density. \n\nThe most important among them rely on the accurate knowledge of the properties of the \n\npure compounds. Tat and Van Gerpen14 and Clements15 used a linear mixing rule of \n\npure densities based on the empirical equation proposed by Janarthanan15. Huber16 et al. \n\nalso use density mixing rule to develop preliminary thermodynamic model for biodiesel \n\nfuel fuel. Similarly for the viscosities the approaches proposed by Krisnangkura et al.17 \n\nand Yuan et al.18 allow the estimation of the viscosity of biodiesel fuel using the \n\nGrunberg-Nissan equation that requires accurate values of the viscosities of pure \n\nFAME\u2019s or FAEE\u2019s19. \n\nFor the higher FAEEs and FAMEs, the density and viscosity data for a wide range of \n\ntemperatures available in the literature are sometimes scarce or contradictory, limiting \n\nthe use of these models to predict those properties for biodiesels. \n\nTo address this limitation, in this work densities and viscosities of seven ethyl esters \n\nand eight methyl esters, from C8 to C18, were measured at atmospheric pressure and \n\ntemperatures from (273.15 to 363.15) K. A comparison with the experimental data \n\navailable and its critical evaluation is performed. Correlations of these experimental \n\ndata using the equations on which the multicomponent models are based, a linear \n\ncorrelation of the densities with temperature and the Vogel Tamman Fluch (VTF) \n\nequation for the viscosities were carried and reported. \n\nThe densities and viscosities of the pure ethyl and methyl esters here measured were \n\nalso used to evaluate the performance of three predictive models. The group \n\ncontribution method GCVOL20 was evaluated for the prediction of densities while the \n\nmodels of Ceriani et al.12 and Marrero and Gani21,22 were evaluated for the viscosity. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\n \n\nExperimental Section \n\n \n\nMaterials and Procedure.

Measurements of viscosity and density were \n\nperformed in the temperature range of (273.15 to 363.15) K at atmospheric pressure \n\nusing an automated SVM 3000 Anton Paar rotational Stabinger viscometer-densimeter. \n\nThe viscometer is based on a tube filled with the sample in which floats a hollow \n\nmeasuring rotor.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\n \n\nDue to its low density, the rotor is centered in the heavier liquid by buoyancy forces. \n\nConsequently, a measuring gap is formed between the rotor and the tube. The rotor is \n\nforced to rotate by shear stresses in the liquid and is guided axially by a built-in \n\npermanent magnet, which interacts with a soft iron ring. The rotating magnetic field \n\ndelivers the speed signal and induces Eddy currents in the surrounding copper casing. \n\nThese Eddy currents are proportional to the speed of the rotor and exert a retarding \n\ntorque on the rotor. Two different torques influence the speed of the measuring rotor, \n\nand at the equilibrium, the two torques are equal and the viscosity can be traced back to \n\na single speed measurement. The SVM 3000 uses Peltier elements for fast and efficient \n\nthermostability. The temperature uncertainty is 0.02 K from (288.15 to 378.15) K. The \n\nabsolute uncertainty of the density is 0.0005 g\u2022cm-3 and the relative uncertainty of the \n\ndynamic viscosity obtained is less than 1.5 % for the standard fluid SHL120 (SH \n\nCalibration Service GMbH), in the range of the studied temperatures. The repeatability \n\nof the equipment was measured with temperature and presents a maximum standard \n\ndeviation relative value of 0.15 % in the studied viscosity range for the same \n\ntemperature range. Also the reproducibility of the equipment was evaluated with time \n\nand presents a maximum of 0.25 %.23 Further details about the equipment and method \n\ncan be found elsewhere.24 This viscometer was previously tested for other compounds \n\nand presented a very good reproducibility.25 \n\n \n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\nDensity \n\nThe experimental data obtained are reported in Tables 2 and 3.

This difference is \n\nhigher than what would be expected from the addition of a methylene (CH2) group to \n\nthe molecule. This results from a change in the ordering of the molecules in the liquid \n\nstate akin to what can be observed in the crystal structures of methyl stearate and ethyl \n\nstearate.26 It was also previously observed for other light esters that the addition of CH2 \n\ngroup in to the alcohol moiety induces a lower molecular packing efficiency decreasing \n\ndensity.27 \n\nFigures 1 and 2 present the relative deviations between this work\u2019s experimental data \n\nand density data available in the literature as function of temperature for FAEEs and \n\nFAMEs, respectively.

While \n\nthe CM method provides a good description of the viscosities the deviations for the \n\nFAEEs are clearly superior than for FAMEs, meaning that the inclusion of a methyl \n\ngroup affects the viscosities differently depending on its location as also observed for \n\nthe densities. Moreover this model also provides poor estimates for the viscosities of \n\nunsaturated esters at high temperatures. This may be related with the use of Ceriani et \n\nal.33 data on the estimation of the model parameters that, as discussed above, present \n\nlarge deviations from the data of other authors. \n\n \n\nConclusions \n\n \n\nNew experimental data for the density and viscosity of pure saturated and unsaturated \n\nmethyl and ethyl esters in the temperature range (273 to 363) K and at atmospheric \n\npressure are presented. An extensive critical review of the data available for these \n\nsystems was carried out to identify spurious or poor quality data among the often \n\nconflicting data previously available in the literature. \n\nThe experimental data here reported were used to test predictive models for these \n\nproperties. The liquid densities were compared with GCVOL model predictions to show \n\nthat it is able to describe the FAMEs with deviations smaller than 1 %. However, larger \n\ndeviations were found for the correlation of FAEEs densities and GCVOL model \n\npredicted values, presenting a maximum deviation from the experimental data of 1.5 %. \n\nThe Ceriani and Meirelles method is shown to be superior to the Marrero and Gani \n\nmethod with viscosity predictions with an average deviation of 4.53 % for FAMEs and \n\n7.92 % for FAEEs. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n60 \n\n \n\n \n\nLiterature Cited \n\n \n(1).

The majority \n\ncomponents are well described in literature but minority components are poorly \n\ncharacterized. These are however required to develop reliable models to predict the \n\nbiodiesel behavior. This work considers minor components of biodiesel: the \n\npolyunsaturated compounds (in C18), the mono unsaturated (in C16, C20 and C22) and \n\nthe long chain saturated esters. In this work densities and viscosities of pure fatty acid \n\nesters minor components of biodiesel fuel were measured (three ethyl esters and seven \n\nmethyl esters), at atmospheric pressure and temperatures from (273.15 to 373.15) K. \n\nCorrelations for the densities and viscosities with temperature are proposed. Three \n\npredictive models were evaluated in the prediction of densities and viscosities of the \n\npure ethyl and methyl esters here reported. The GCVOL group contribution method is \n\nshown to be able to predict densities for these compounds within 1.5 %. The methods of \n\nCeriani et al. (CM) and of Marrero et al. (MG) were applied to the viscosity data. The \n\nfirst show a better predictive capacity to provide a fair description of the viscosities of \n\nthe minority esters here studied. \n\nKeywords: Biodiesel, Density, Fatty Acid Methyl Esters, Fatty Acid Ethyl Esters, \n\nViscosity. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n67 \n\n \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\nNowadays, biodiesel fuel is seen as an alternative to the conventional petroleum based \n\nfuels, reducing the dependency on fossil fuels and controlling green house gases \n\nemissions.1 Biodiesel fuel advantages and applications are well established.2-9 This \n\nbiofuel is comprised of mono-alkyl esters of fatty acids derived from vegetable oils, \n\nanimal fats, or mixtures of them. It is usually produced by the transesterification \n\nreaction of triglycerides with a short chain alcohol, usually methanol or ethanol, in \n\npresence of a catalyst, leading to the formation of mixtures of fatty acid methyl esters \n\n(FAMEs) or fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), respectively.7, 9 The main components of \n\nbiodiesel fuel depend on the raw materials used and, consequently, a wide range of \n\nesters can be present.10 Knowing the profile of methyl or ethyl esters in biodiesel is of \n\ngreat importance as it controls its main properties.10 \n\nThe fuel density influences the amount of mass injected at the injection systems, \n\npumps and injectors.11-12 An amount of fuel precisely adjusted is necessary to provide \n\nproper combustion.13 Combustion is initialized trough atomization of the fuel. The use \n\nof a viscous fuel leads to a poor atomization which is responsible of premature injector \n\ncooking and poor fuel combustion.11, 14 \n\nDensities and viscosities data are well established for the more important biodiesel \n\ncompounds, however some of the minor components have received little attention in the \n\npast. However, they may have a non negligible influence on the biodiesel fuel properties \n\nand, depending on the raw material used, these components can be present in a \n\nsignificant concentration. \n\nThe main goal of this work is to present new density and viscosity data for the \n\nminority components of biodiesel fuel such as methyl palmitoleate, methyl linolenate, \n\nmethyl arachidate, methyl gadoleate, methyl behenate, methyl erucate, methyl \n\nlignocerate, ethyl linoleate, ethyl linolenate, and ethyl arachidate, at atmospheric \n\npressure and temperatures from (273.15 to 363.15) K. Some of these esters can be found \n\nin biodiesel fuel from peanut, rapeseed or canola oils.9 \n\nAmong the studied esters, density data with temperature has been found only for \n\nmethyl linolenate. Ott el al.15 compiled the available density data. Besides the seven \n\npoints reported by them only Gouw and Vlugter16 measured two other data points, in \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n68 \n\n \n\n1964. For the other esters some isolated density data were obtained from the \n\ncompound\u2019s supplier. \n\nAs experimental measurements are time consuming and expensive, especially for \n\nthese minority biodiesel esters components, new models are necessary to predict these \n\nproperties. \n\nSeveral models have been proposed in the literature to estimate biodiesel fuel density \n\nand viscosity. The most important among them rely on the accurate knowledge of the \n\nproperties of the pure compounds.17 However, the scarcity of density and viscosity data \n\navailable in the literature restricts the use of these models to predict properties for \n\nbiodiesel fuel. In a previous work17, the densities and viscosities of common pure \n\nmethyl and ethyl esters were measured and used to evaluate the performance of three \n\npredictive models. For prediction of density the group contribution method GCVOL18 \n\nmodel was evaluated while the models of Ceriani et al.19 and Marrero et al. 20 were \n\ntested for the viscosity. The behavior of these models is here compared against the data \n\nfor the compounds here studied. \n\n \n\nExperimental Section \n\n \n\nMaterials and Procedure. Three ethyl ester and seven methyl esters were used in this \n\nstudy. Table 1 reports the name, purity, supplier, and CAS number of each compound \n\nused in this study. Compound purity was confirmed by gas chromatography/flame \n\nionization detection (GC-FID). \n\n \n\nExperimental Measurements. Measurements of viscosity and density were performed \n\nin the temperature range of (273.15 to 373.15) K, or above melting point for saturated \n\ncompounds, at atmospheric pressure using an automated SVM 3000 Anton Paar \n\nrotational Stabinger viscometer-densimeter. The viscometer is based on a tube filled \n\nwith the sample in which floats a hollow measuring rotor. Because of its low density, \n\nthe rotor is centered in the heavier liquid by buoyancy forces. Consequently, a \n\nmeasuring gap is formed between the rotor and the tube. The rotor is forced to rotate by \n\nshear stresses in the liquid and is guided axially by a built-in permanent magnet, which \n\ninteracts with a soft iron ring. The rotating magnetic field delivers the speed signal and \n\ninduces Eddy currents in the surrounding copper casing. These eddy currents are \n\n\n\n \n\n69 \n\n \n\nproportional to the speed of the rotor and exert a retarding torque on the rotor. Two \n\ndifferent torques influence the speed of the measuring rotor, and at the equilibrium, the \n\ntwo torques are equal and the viscosity can be traced back to a single speed \n\nmeasurement. The SVM 3000 uses Peltier elements for fast and efficient \n\nthermostability. The temperature uncertainty is 0.02 K from (288.15 to 378.15) K. The \n\nabsolute uncertainty of the density is 0.0005 g\u2022cm-3 and the relative uncertainty of the \n\ndynamic viscosity obtained is less than 0.5 % for the standard fluid SHL120 (SH \n\nCalibration Service GMbH), in the range of the studied temperatures. Further details \n\nabout the equipment and method can be found elsewhere.21 This viscometer was \n\npreviously tested for other compounds and presented a very good reproducibility.17, 22 \n\n \n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\nDensity.

Predicting \n\ndensity is of high relevance for a correct formulation of an adequate blend of raw \n\nmaterials that optimize the cost of biodiesel fuel production while allowing the \n\nproduced fuel to meet the required quality standards. The aim of this work is to present \n\nnew density data for different biodiesels and use the reported data to evaluate the \n\npredictive capability of models previously proposed to predict biodiesel or fatty acid \n\nmethyl esters densities. Densities were measured here for ten biodiesel samples, for \n\nwhich detailed composition is reported, at atmospheric pressure and temperatures from \n\n278.15 to 373.15 K. Density dependence with temperature correlations was proposed \n\nfor the biodiesels and isobaric expansivities are presented. The new experimental data \n\nhere presented were used, along with other literature data, to evaluate predictive density \n\nmodels such as those based on Kay\u2019s mixing rules and the GCVOL group contribution \n\nmethod. It is shown that Kay\u2019s mixing rules and a revised form of GCVOL model are \n\nable to predict biodiesels densities with average deviations of only 0.3%. A comparison \n\nbetween biodiesel densities produced from similar vegetable oils, by different authors, \n\nhighlights the importance of knowing the detailed composition of the samples. An \n\nextension of GCVOL for high pressures is also proposed here. It is shown that it can \n\npredict the densities of biodiesel fuels with average deviations less than 0.4%. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Biodiesel, Fatty Acid Methyl Esters, Density Prediction, Kay\u2019s mixing \n\nrules, GCVOL. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n85 \n\n \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n\n \n\nBiodiesel is a promising alternative energy resource for diesel fuel, consisting of alkyl \n\nmonoesters of fatty acids, obtained from vegetable oils or animal fats combined with a \n\nshort chain alcohol. It has properties similar to ordinary diesel fuel made from crude oil \n\nand can be used in conventional diesel engines without any motorization \n\ntransformation. Transesterification by alkaline catalysis is the most common process for \n\nproducing biodiesel at industrial level. Biodiesel is more environmentally friendly, \n\nnontoxic and biodegradable compared to diesel fuel.1-3  \n\nBiodiesel fuel has to fulfill a number of quality standards. In Europe, the biodiesel \n\nfuel standards are compiled in the Norm CEN EN 142144 and in USA in the ASTM \n\nD67515. Norms specify minimum requirements and test methods for biodiesel fuel to be \n\nused in diesel engines and for heating purposes, in order to increase the biodiesel fuel \n\nquality and its acceptance among consumers. Density is an important fuel property, \n\nbecause injection systems, pumps and injectors, must deliver an amount of fuel \n\nprecisely adjusted to provide proper combustion.6 Boudy and Seers7 and Baroutian et \n\nal.8 show that fuel density is the main property that influences the amount of mass \n\ninjected. Density data is also important in numerous unit operations in biodiesel \n\nproduction. Density data is required to be known to properly design reactors, distillation \n\nunits and separation process, storage tanks and process piping.9,10 Density depends on \n\nthe raw materials used for biodiesel fuel production and on the biodiesel methyl esters \n\nprofile.11 Following a previous work addressing biodiesels viscosity predictions 12, this \n\nwork aims at evaluating the best predictive models for biodiesel densities and \n\nsubsequent revision of them. \n\nRapeseed, soybean and palm oils are the most commonly used oils to produce \n\nbiodiesel, although non edible oils, such as Jatropha, are becoming more important.9 \n\nThe capacity to correctly predict biodiesel densities is of major relevance for a correct \n\nformulation of an adequate blend of raw materials aiming at producing biodiesel \n\naccording to the required quality standards13,14 with the lowest production costs. \n\nThree main types of methods exist for estimating liquid densities of pure compounds. \n\nThe first types are the methods based on the corresponding states theory, such as the \n\nRackett equation and the Spencer and Danner method.8,9,11,15-19 These methods have, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n86 \n\n \n\nhowever, some disadvantages such as the requirement of critical properties and since \n\nthey oftenly use experimental data adjusted parameters, they have a limited predictive \n\nability. The second type of methods is based on mixing rules, such as Kay\u2019s20,21 that \n\nallow the estimation of a mixture density provide that the composition of the fuel and \n\nthe densities of the pure compounds are known. They are only applicable to simple \n\nmixtures with a near ideal behavior. Finally, group contribution models are another \n\napproach that only requires the chemical structure of the desired molecule to be known \n\nto estimate the thermophysical properties, such as liquid densities. The group \n\ncontribution method GCVOL22 is a predictive model that was shown in previous \n\nworks13,14 to be able to provide pure fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) densities \n\ndescriptions within 1% deviation. \n\nThere are several publications in the literature presenting density data for biodiesels in \n\nwide ranges of temperatures, but usually no information about biodiesels compositions \n\nis provided and thus this data cannot be used for model evaluation. The scarcity of \n\nbiodiesel density data for which composition information is available, limits the use of \n\nthese models to predict this property for biodiesel fuels. \n\nIn the present work, we report new experimental density data for ten biodiesel \n\nsamples, for which a detailed composition is presented. They were produced from \n\ndifferent vegetable oils or oil blends as reported below. The data cover the temperature \n\nrange from 278.15 to 373.15 K at atmospheric pressure. Correlations for the \n\ntemperature dependency of the experimental data are reported and the isobaric \n\nexpansivities estimated. \n\nThese data, along with other data collected from literature, are used to carry out a \n\ncritical evaluation of biodiesel density predictive models. \n\n \n\n2. Experimental Section \n\n \n\n2.1. Biodiesel samples synthesis \n\nTen biodiesel samples were studied in this work. Two of these samples were obtained \n\nfrom Portuguese biodiesel producers, namely Soy A and GP (Soybean+Rapeseed). \n\nEight biodiesel samples were synthesized at our laboratory by a transesterification \n\nreaction of the vegetal oils: Soybean (S), Rapeseed (R), and Palm (P), and their \n\n\n\n \n\n87 \n\n \n\nrespective binary and ternary mixtures: Soybean+Rapeseed (SR), Rapeseed+Palm (RP), \n\nSoybean+Palm (SP), and Soybean+Rapeseed +Palm (SRP) and Sunflower (Sf). The \n\nmolar ratio of oil/methanol used was 1:5 with 0.5% sodium hydroxide by weight of oil \n\nas catalyst. The reaction was performed at 55 \u00baC during 24 h under methanol reflux. The \n\nreaction time chosen was adopted for convenience and to guarantee a complete reaction \n\nconversion. Raw glycerol was removed in two steps, the first after 3 h reaction and then \n\nafter 24 h reaction in a separating funnel. Biodiesel was purified by washing with hot \n\ndistillated water until a neutral pH was achieved. The biodiesel was then dried until the \n\nEN ISO 12937 limit for water was reached (less than 500 ppm of water). The water \n\ncontent was checked by Karl- Fischer titration.  \n\nBiodiesel was characterized by GC-FID following the British Standard EN14103 \n\nfrom EN 142144 to know the methyl esters composition of the samples. \n\n \n\n2.2 Experimental Measurements \n\nDensity measurements were performed in the temperature range of 278.15 to 373.15 \n\nK and at atmospheric pressure using an automated SVM 3000 Anton Paar rotational \n\nStabinger Viscometer. The apparatus was equipped with a vibrating U-tube densimeter. \n\nThe absolute uncertainty of the density is 0.0005 kg\u00b7m-3. The SVM 3000 uses Peltier \n\nelements for fast and efficient thermostability. The temperature uncertainty is \u00b10.02 K \n\nfrom 288.15 to 378.15 K. The SVM was previously tested for other compounds and \n\npresented a very good reproducibility.13,23 The instrument was rinsed with ethanol \n\nthree times and then pumped in a closed circuit at constant flow of the solvent during \n\ntwenty minutes at 323 K. This cleaning cycle was repeated with acetone and then kept \n\nat 343 K for thirty minutes under a stream of air to ensure that the measurement cell was \n\nthoroughly cleaned and dried before the measurement of a new sample. \n\nCapillary gas chromatography was used to determine the composition in methyl ester \n\nof biodiesel samples. A Varian CP-3800 with a flame ionization detector in a split \n\ninjection system with a Select\u2122 Biodiesel for FAME Column, (30 m x 0.32 mm x 0.25 \n\n\u00b5m), was used to discriminate between all methyl esters in analysis inclusively the \n\npolyunsaturated ones. The column temperature was set at 120\u00baC and then programmed \n\nto increase up to 250 \u00baC, at 4 \u00baC/min. Detector and injector were set at 250\u00baC. The \n\ncarrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 2 mL/min. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n88 \n\n \n\n3. Density models \n\n3.1. Linear Mixing Rules \n\nKay\u2019s Mixing Rules20,21 are the simplest form of mixing rules by which mixture \n\nproperties are obtained by summing the products of the component properties by \n\nweighting factors, which are usually the concentrations of the components in a mixture. \n\nFor example, \n\ni\n\nm\n\ni\nic ?? ?=  Eq. 1 \n\nwhere ci is the concentration and ?i is the density of component i. \n\nThe major drawback in the application of linear mixing rules is that they require the \n\nknowledge of the experimental densities of the pure components present on the mixture \n\nand assume that the mixture excess volumes are negligible. This may be not feasible for \n\nmany real fluids because they are either composed by a large number of compounds or \n\nthey have different natures and subsequently the excess volumes are non negligible. \n\nHowever biodiesels are simple mixtures composed, in general, by less than ten fatty \n\nacid esters all from the same family and consequently excess volumes are very small. In \n\nfact, they have been used before by several authors to predict biodiesels densities. \n\nJanarthanan and Clemments24 first used this approach with molar fraction as weighting \n\nfactors. Tat and Gerpen18 proposed the use of mass fractions as weighting factor. \n\nNevertheless, the dimensionally correct way to use concentrations in Kay\u2019s mixing rules \n\nto predict densities would be as volumetric fractions. Recently, new accurate \n\ninformation about biodiesels fatty acid methyl esters composition was reported13,14 \n\nallowing the application of Kay\u2019s Mixing Rules to predict biodiesels density data \n\n \n\n3.2. GCVOL Group Contribution Method \n\nGCVOL is a group contribution method developed for the prediction of molar \n\nvolumes of liquids. It is a completely predictive model based exclusively in the \n\nmolecular structure of the compound. With this approach liquid densities, even for \n\nstrongly polar solvents, can be predicted with an error of approximately 1% in the \n\ntemperature range between melting temperature and the normal boiling point.22  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n89 \n\n \n\nIn previous works13,14 we have shown that good descriptions of fatty esters densities \n\ncould be obtained with this model. \n\nFor the calculation of liquid densities the relation between molecular weight, MWj, \n\nand molar volume, Vj, is used \n\nj\nj\n\nj\n\nj\nj\n\nj\n\nVx\n\nMWx\n\n?\n\n?\n=?  Eq. 2 \n\nBeing xj the molar fraction of the component j. The molar volume of a liquid j is \n\ncalculated by the following equation \n\n? ?=\ni\n\niinV ?  Eq. 3 \nwhere ni is the number of group i, and the temperature dependency of molar group, \n\n??i, in cm3\u00b7mol-1, is given by the following simple polynomial function \n2TCTBAv iiii ?+?+=?  Eq. 4 \n\nwhere T is the absolute temperature that can vary between the melting point and the \n\nnormal boiling point when the model is used to predict densities of solvents. The Ai, Bi \n\nand Ci parameters were obtained from Elbro et al.\n22 The original GCVOL model \n\npresented 36 different group parameters for a variety of chemical classes, such as \n\nalkanes, aromatic, alkenes, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, esters, ethers, chlorides, and \n\nsiloxanes. \n\n \n\n3.3. Extended GCVOL Group Contribution Method \n\nSince the publication of GCVOL in 1991 other new groups were defined and new \n\nparameters for different functional groups were published. In 2003 an extension and \n\nrevised version of GCVOL, with new parameters for all groups, was published.25 This \n\nversion of the GCVOL was also tested in this work.  \n\n \n\n3.4. Database for Biodiesels Densities \n\nAlthough some biodiesel density data can be found in literature, information \n\nconcerning the detailed biodiesel composition, other than just the oil used in the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n90 \n\n \n\nbiodiesel synthesis, is scarce. Densities in a range of temperature, instead of the \n\nstandard value at 15 \u00baC required by the EN 142144, are also rare. \n\nDetailed biodiesel composition is required for the application of the models here \n\nselected. The database used in this study, reported in Table 1, was collected from the \n\nliterature and supplemented with the new experimental data for ten biodiesels measured \n\nin this work. The most important oils used in biodiesel production (soy, rapeseed and \n\npalm) were covered by this study, and mixtures of them as well as other vegetable oils \n\n(sunflower and two biodiesel samples from a Portuguese biodiesel producer) were also \n\nused. Literature soybean biodiesel density data were compiled even without information \n\nabout esters composition, in order to compare density data from distinct oil crops of the \n\nsame kind. \n\n \n\nTable 1.

Pure compound densities were obtained \n\nfrom our previous works13,14. Detailed results are reported on Table 6 for all the \n\nbiodiesel studied. Very good predictions were obtained with all the three approaches \n\nconsidered, with ARD of about 0.33%. No significant differences between the results \n\nobtained with the different versions of the Kay\u2019s Mixing Rule are observed, what may \n\ncome as a surprise but that can easily be justified by the similarity of the compounds, in \n\nnature and size, present in the biodiesels, resulting on similar concentrations values \n\nwherever are the units adopted resulting in a marginal impact on the prediction (Figure \n\n1A). \n\nThe two versions of GCVOL model were also used to predict biodiesels densities. \n\nResults for the relative deviations are reported for all the biodiesels studied in Table 6. \n\nTo define the ester group, parameters for both the \u2013COO\u2013 and \u2013CH2COO\u2013groups were \n\ntested, and large deviations were reported when using the \u2013CH2COO\u2013group. \n\nConsequently, the \u2013COO\u2013 group was adopted in this work to describe the ester group. \n\nThe results reported suggest that, the original version of GCVOL, with overall average \n\ndeviations of 0.60% is far superior to the Extended GCVOL version with overall \n\naverage deviations of 2.7%. \n\nResults from previous works of ours13,14 and the ones shown in Figure 1B indicate \n\nthat the GCVOL has a poor performance for unsaturated methyl esters and biodiesels \n\nwith higher content of unsaturated esters, such as soybean biodiesel. The results suggest \n\nthat the temperature dependency of the \u2013CH= parameter is not correct and can be \n\nimproved. \n\nNew values for Ai, Bi and Ci for the double bond parameter (\u2013CH=) were estimated \n\nbased on the density data for fatty acid esters reported in previous works of ours13,14 and \n\nused to predict the densities of the biodiesels here studied. The new values for the \u2013CH= \n\nparameter here proposed, reported in Table 7, reduce the overall relative deviations of \n\nthe GCVOL predictions from 0.60% to 0.25%. Figure 1C presents the relative \n\ndeviations obtained by the revised GCVOL model as function of the temperature and it \n\nis shown that the deviations are now essentially temperature independent. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n97 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 7.

Conclusions \n\n \n\nNew experimental data for the density of ten biodiesels in the temperature range 273 \n\nto 363 K and at atmospheric pressure are reported. \n\nThe experimental data here measured were used to test predictive models for \n\nbiodiesels densities. Three versions of the Kay\u2019s mixing rule and two versions of the \n\nGCVOL model were investigated. With exception of the Extended GCVOL model all \n\napproaches seem to be able to describe the biodiesels densities with deviations smaller \n\nthan 1%. The various approaches to the Kay\u2019s mixing rules studied produce similar \n\nresults and the revised version of the GCVOL model here proposed predicts the \n\nbiodiesels densities with deviations of only 0.25%. \n\nAn extension of the GCVOL model to high pressures is here proposed based on \n\ncorrelated data for three methyl esters.

Pressure \n\ninfluence in fuel density has becoming particularly important with the increase use of \n\nmodern common rail systems where pressure can reach 250MPa. \n\nNevertheless, besides its importance, little attention has been given to biodiesels high \n\npressure densities. In fact, there are almost no reports in literature about experimental \n\nhigh pressure biodiesel density data. \n\nTo overcome this lack of information, in this work, new experimental measurements, \n\nfrom 283 to 333 K and from atmospheric pressure to 45MPa, were performed for \n\nmethyl laurate, methyl myristate and methyl oleate and for methyl biodiesels from \n\nPalm, Soybean and Rapeseed oils and from three binary and one ternary mixtures of \n\nthese oils. \n\nFollowing previous works, were the Cubic-Plus-Association equation of state (CPA \n\nEoS) was shown to be the most appropriate model to be applied to biodiesel production \n\nand purification processes, the new high pressure experimental data here reported was \n\nalso successfully predicted with the CPA EoS, with a maximum deviation of 2.5 %. A \n\ndiscussion about the most appropriate CPA pure compound parameters for fatty acid \n\nmethyl esters is also presented. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Fatty Acid Methyl Esters, Biodiesels, High-Pressure Density, \n\nExperimental measurements, modified Tait-Tammann equation, CPA EoS. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n107 \n\n \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n\nBiodiesel has recently been the focus of increasing attention from researchers due to \n\nits rising use as a new energy solution to replace petroleum based fuels. Its production \n\nhas increased exponentially in the last decade, from worldwide negligible productions \n\nin 1990 its production reached over 2500 million tons in 2008. Biodiesel is the most \n\nused biofuel in Europe, reaching the 9.6 million tons of consumption1. \n\nBesides its well known environmental advantages over petroleum fuels2, biodiesel can \n\nbe mixed in all proportions with regular diesel with no motor changes, it\u2019s easier to \n\nstore and transport and has a more favorable combustion profile3-4. It consists on a blend \n\nof fatty acid esters that are industrially produced trough the transesterification reaction \n\nof a vegetable oil or a fat with an alcohol, usually using a basic catalyst to increase \n\nreaction speed and yield3. Rapeseed, Soybean and Palm oils are the most commonly \n\nused oils to produce biodiesel5. \n\nNowadays, most new vehicles operate with common rail diesel engines, which use \n\nhigh injection pressures to allow a rapid fuel atomization and combustion with \n\nconsequent higher engine efficiencies and lower emissions6. Modern ultra-high-pressure \n\ninjection systems can approach pressures of 250MPa7. \n\nConsidering the predictable increase of biodiesel use, with Europe aiming to replace \n\n20% of fossil fuels for alternative renewable fuels such as biofuels until 20201, and the \n\nintroduction of common rail engines in new vehicles, it is expected that these engines \n\nwill work with biodiesel-fuel blends with high biodiesel content and eventually even \n\nwith pure biodiesels. \n\nAs Boudy and Seers8 explained, from the evaluation of the effect of different fuel \n\nproperties on the injection process of common rail direct injection systems, density is \n\nthe main property controlling the pressure wave in common rail systems and \n\nsubsequently the total mass injected. NOx emissions increase from biodiesel use is \n\npartly related to advancing of injection timing caused by the more rapid pressure wave \n\ntransfer from the fuel injection pump to the fuel injector causing it to open earlier.9-10 \n\nThe European Committee for Standardization (CEN) has established quality standards \n\nspecifying minimum requirements and test methods for biodiesels, the DIN EN \n\n14214:201011, including density specifications. However, these standards at ambient \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n108 \n\n \n\nconditions can hardly be applied for common rail engines since densities suffer strong \n\noscillations under high pressures. \n\nKnowledge and description of biodiesel densities as a function of pressure and \n\ntemperature are therefore required for a correct biodiesel formulation and for a proper \n\ndesign and optimization of common rail engines injection systems, in order to a \n\nprecisely adjusted amount of fuel be delivered to provide a proper combustion while \n\nminimizing NOx emissions7. However, in spite of its importance, little attention has \n\nbeen given to high pressure densities of biodiesels and measurements and predictions of \n\nthat property have been restricted to ambient conditions. Only Aparicio et al.12-13 \n\nreported density measurements, in the temperature range 288.15 to 328.15 K and \n\npressure range 0.1 to 350 MPa, for the Rapeseed and Sunflower oil methyl esters. Their \n\nexperimental results were correlated with the modified Tait-Tammann equation. \n\nAfter reporting experimental data for the atmospheric pressure temperature \n\ndependence of density for several fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters (from the most \n\ncommonly found in biodiesels samples14 to the less common15), for different \n\nbiodiesels16, and studying the best models to predict the densities of biodiesel16, we \n\ncarried out here experimental high pressure density measurements for several of these \n\npure compounds and biodiesels. \n\nNew high pressure density data is reported in this work for three fatty acid methyl \n\nesters and seven biodiesels, in the temperature range 283 to 333 K and from \n\natmospheric pressure to 45MPa. Experimental densities were correlated using the \n\nmodified Tait-Tammann equation17 and thermodynamic properties such as isothermal \n\ncompressibilities and isobaric expansion coefficients were as well calculated and \n\nevaluated, on the temperature and pressure ranges studied. \n\nEmpirical models, like the modified Tait-Tammann equation, are the most commonly \n\nused to correlate high pressure density experimental data. In this work, a different and \n\ncompletely predictive approach was also applied, that consisted on the use of the Cubic-\n\nPlus-Association equation of state (CPA EoS) to describe the experimental data. In \n\nprevious works18-20, the CPA EoS was shown to be the most appropriate model to be \n\napplied to biodiesel production and purification processes. A discussion about the most \n\nappropriate CPA pure compound parameters for esters is also presented. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n109 \n\n \n\n \n\n2. Experimental Section \n\n \n\n2.1. Materials \n\nExperimental densities were measured for three pure methyl esters, for methyl laurate \n\nand methyl myristate supplied by SAFC with purity 98% and for methyl oleate at 99% \n\npurity from Aldrich, and for seven different biodiesels samples. Biodiesels were \n\nsynthesized by the transesterification reaction with methanol of the vegetal oils: \n\nSoybean (S), Rapeseed (R) and Palm (P) and their respective binary and ternary \n\nmixtures: Soybean + Rapeseed (SR), Rapeseed + Palm (RP), Soybean + Palm (SP) and \n\nSoybean + Rapeseed +Palm (SRP). The molar ratio of oil/methanol used was 1:5 using \n\n0.5% sodium hydroxide by weight of oil as a catalyst. The reaction was performed at 55 \n\n\u00baC during 24 h under methanol reflux. The reaction time chosen was adopted for \n\nconvenience and to guarantee a complete reaction conversion. Raw glycerol was \n\nremoved in two steps, the first after 3h reaction and then after 24h reaction in a \n\nseparating funnel. Biodiesel was purified trough washing with hot distillated water until \n\na neutral pH was achieved. The biodiesel was then dried until the EN ISO 14214 limit \n\nfor water was reached (less than 500 mg/kg of water11). \n\nBiodiesels were characterized by GC-FID following the British Standard EN14103 \n\nfrom EN 1421411 to know their methyl esters composition. Capillary gas \n\nchromatography was used to determine the methyl ester composition of the biodiesel \n\nsamples. A Varian CP-3800 with a flame ionization detector in a split injection system \n\nwith a Select\u2122 Biodiesel for FAME Column, (30 m x 0.32 mm x 0.25 \u00b5m), was used to \n\ndifferentiate all methyl esters in analysis inclusively the poli-unsaturated ones. The \n\ncolumn temperature was set at 120\u00baC and then programmed to increase up to 250 \u00baC, at \n\n4 \u00baC/min. Detector and injector were set at 250\u00baC. The carrier gas was helium with a \n\nflow rate of 2 mL/min. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n110 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2. Experimental Procedure \n\nExperimental high pressure densities were determined using an Anton Paar 512P \n\nvibrating tube densimeter, connected to an Anton Paar DMA 4500 data acquisition unit. \n\nThis device determines the vibration period of a metallic U-shape cell filled with the \n\nstudied fluid, which is directly linked to the sample fluid density. The calibration \n\nprocedure used in this case has been described previously in detail21-22 using water and \n\nvacuum as calibrating references. This method enables the highest accuracy in density \n\ndetermination over wide ranges of pressure, and even reliable density extrapolation can \n\nbe performed. The repeatability in the density values determined from the vibration \n\nperiod measured by the DMA 4500 unit is 10-5 g cm-3. \n\nTemperature stability is ensured with a PolyScience 9510 circulating fluid bath, and \n\nthe temperature value is determined with a CKT100 platinum probe placed in the \n\nimmediacy of the density measuring cell, with an uncertainty that has been determined \n\nto be lower than 5\u202210-2 K. \n\nPressure is generated and controlled using a Ruska 7610 pressure controller, whose \n\npressure stability is 2\u202210-3 MPa. The pumping hydraulic fluid (dioctylsebacate fluid) is \n\nin direct contact with the fluid sample inside the 1.59\u202210-3 m diameter steel pressure line \n\nconduction, with a coil designed to keep a distance (around 1m) from the fluid contact \n\ninterface to the measuring cell, avoiding any diffusion effect. The combinations of \n\ndensity determination repeatability, and the accuracies in temperature and pressure \n\nmeasurement, lead to an overall experimental density uncertainty value that is lower \n\nthan 0.1 Kg m-3 for the whole pressure and temperature range studied in this work. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. Density models \n\n \n\n3.1. Modified Tait-Tammann equation.  \n\nLiquid densities were correlated using the modified Tait-Tammann equation 17. Other \n\nthermodynamic properties were also derived from this equation, such as the isothermal \n\ncompressibility coefficient, kT, and the isobaric expansion coefficient, ?p. \n\n\n\n \n\n111 \n\n \n\nThe following form of the modified Tait-Tammann equation17 is used in this work: \n\n \n\nEq. 1 \n\n \n\nWhere \n\n2\n321)1.0,( TaTaaMPaPT ++==?

CPA Equation-of-State.  \n\nThe Cubic\u2013Plus\u2013Association (CPA) equation of state23-25 combines a physical \n\ncontribution from a cubic equation of state, in this work the Soave\u2013Redlich\u2013Kwong \n\n(SRK), with an association term accounting for intermolecular hydrogen bonding and \n\nsolvation effects26-27, originally proposed by Wertheim and used in other association \n\nequations of state such as SAFT28. The association term included in the CPA EoS \n\nallowed, in previous works from ours, to correctly describe the water solubility in fatty \n\nacid esters and biodiesels20, the atmospheric29 and near/supercritical30 VLE of fatty acid \n\nesters + alcohols systems and the LLE of multicomponent systems containing fatty acid \n\nesters, alcohols, glycerol and water18-19, 31, since it can explicitly take into account the \n\nsolvation phenomena found in these systems containing non-self-associating \n\ncompounds (esters) that can associate with self-associating compounds like water, \n\nalcohols and glycerol. As, in this work, we are dealing with esters mixtures and as esters \n\nare known to not self-associate, the association term disappears from the CPA EoS and \n\nit can be expressed in terms of the compressibility factor as:  \n\n( )?\n?\n\n? bRT\na\n\nb\nZ\n\n+\n?\n\n?\n=\n\n11\n\n1\n Eq. 8 \n\nwhere a is the energy parameter, b the co\u2013volume parameter, ? is the molar density, g a \n\nsimplified hard\u2013sphere radial distribution function.  \n\nThe pure component energy parameter, a, is obtained from a Soave\u2013type temperature \n\ndependency: \n\n( )[ ] 210 11)( rTcaTa ?+=\n \n\nEq. 9 \n\nFor mixtures, the energy and co\u2013volume parameters are calculated employing the \n\nconventional van der Waals one\u2013fluid mixing rules: \n\n??=\ni j\n\nijji axxa\n   ( )ijjiij kaaa ?= 1  Eq. 10 \n\nAnd \n\n?=\ni\n\nii bxb\n \n\nEq. 11 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n113 \n\n \n\n \n\nAs explained above, for non\u2013associating components, such as esters, the association \n\nterm disappears and CPA has only three pure component parameters in the cubic term \n\n(a0, c1 and b). These parameters are regressed simultaneously from vapor pressure and \n\nliquid density data. The objective function to be minimized is the following: \n\n?? ??\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n? ?\n+??\n\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n? ?\n=\n\nNP\n\ni i\n\nii\nNP\n\ni i\n\nii\n\nP\n\nPP\nOF\n\n2\n\nexptl\n\ncalcdexptl2\n\nexptl\n\ncalcdexptl\n\n?\n??\n\n Eq. 12 \n\nWith this procedure, better density estimates are provided overcoming SRK \n\ndeficiencies in liquid phase density estimates, while leaving the possibility for future \n\nmodeling in associating systems. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Results and Discussion \n\n \n\nDensity measurements were carried at temperatures ranging from 283.15 to 333.15 K \n\nand pressures from 0.10 to 45.0 MPa, for methyl laurate, methyl myristate, methyl \n\noleate, Rapeseed, Soybean, and Palm biodiesel, Soybean + Rapeseed biodiesel, \n\nRapeseed + Palm biodiesel, Soybean + Palm biodiesel and for Soybean + Rapeseed + \n\nPalm biodiesel.  \n\nTable 1 reports methyl esters compositions for the biodiesels selected for this work. \n\nThis information is of major importance since biodiesels fatty acid esters profile \n\ndetermine their chemical and physical properties, such as densities32.

In the pressure range \n\nconsidered in this work, experimental Rapeseed density values are in good agreement \n\nwith the data reported by Aparicio and co-workers as seen in Figure 1. It should be \n\nrecalled, however, that no detailed biodiesel composition is reported by Aparicio et al. 12 \n\nwhich limits the validity of a comparison since the compositions of the two fluids are \n\nnot the same as discussed elsewhere16. From the experimental results it is possible to \n\nobserve, for all the pure compounds and mixtures studied, that density decreases both \n\nwhen temperature increases and pressure drops. As expected, since a similar behavior \n\nwas previously observed for pure unsaturated fatty acid esters14, biodiesel densities also \n\nincrease with increasing content on unsaturated FAMEs and their unsaturation level. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n119 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.

Fatty acid esters are non\u2013self\u2013associating compounds and so only the three \n\nCPA pure compound parameters of the physical term (a0, c1 and b) are required to \n\ndescribe these compounds. CPA EoS parameters for several esters families were \n\nproposed in a previous work20 were it was also showed that the a0, c1 and b parameters \n\nfollow trends with the ester carbon number. Correlations to compute these parameters \n\nwere proposed enabling to estimate them for new compounds when pure compound \n\ndata are scarce, as happened at the time for liquid densities of the higher carbon number \n\nfatty acid esters.

Parameters values are presented at Table 7, \n\nalong with liquid densities and vapor pressures deviations. An excellent description of \n\n\n\n \n\n125 \n\n \n\nvapor pressures and liquid densities for all the fatty acid methyl esters is achieved with \n\nthe CPA EoS, with global average deviations of 1.6 % and of 0.9 %, respectively. \n\nHaving the CPA pure compound parameters for all the pure fatty acid methyl esters \n\nthat compose the selected biodiesels, the CPA EoS was applied to predict the \n\nexperimental high pressure density data. First, both set of parameters obtained from the \n\ncorrelations and from pure compound data regression were used to predict the pure fatty \n\nacid methyl ester high pressure density data. Higher deviations are obtained when using \n\npure compound parameters computed from correlations, as presented at Table 8, with \n\ndeviations below 6 %. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 8.

A model that could predict the value of viscosity of a \n\nbiodiesel based on the knowledge of its composition would be useful in the optimization \n\nof biodiesel production processes, and the planning of blending of raw materials and \n\nrefined products. This work aims at evaluating the predictive capability of several \n\nmodels previously proposed in the literature for the description of the viscosities of \n\nbiodiesels and their blend with other fuels. The models here evaluated are the Ceriani\u2019s, \n\nKrisnangkura\u2019s and Yuan\u2019s models, along with a revised version of the Yuan\u2019s model \n\nhere proposed. The results for several biodiesel systems show that the revised Yuan \n\nmodel proposed provides the best description of the experimental data with an average \n\ndeviation of 4.65 %, compared to 5.34 % for Yuan\u2019s, 8.07 % for Ceriani\u2019s and 7.25 % \n\nof Krisnangkura\u2019s models. The same conclusions were obtained when applying these \n\nmodels to predict the viscosity of blends of biodiesel with petrodiesel. \n\nKeywords: Biodiesel, Viscosity, Modeling. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n137 \n\n \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n\nBiodiesel refers to a fuel derived from renewable sources that consists of a mixture \n\nof methyl or ethyl esters of long-chain fatty acids which is obtained by \n\ntransesterification of vegetable oils or other feedstocks largely comprised of \n\ntriacylglycerols with a simple alcohol, such as methanol or ethanol in the presence of a \n\ncatalyst1-2. It is nonflammable and nonexplosive, with a flash point of 423 K compared \n\nto 337 K for petrodiesel3. As a fuel it offers many benefits such as ready availability, \n\nportability, renewability, domestic origin, lower sulfur and aromatic content, \n\nbiodegradability, better ignition quality, inherent lubricity, higher cetane number, \n\npositive energy balance, higher density, greater safety, nontoxic character of their \n\nexhaust emissions and cleaner burning4-7. \n\nIt has expanded into the existing markets and infrastructures of gasoline and diesel \n\nand has undergone rapid development and acceptance as an alternative diesel fuel. Its \n\nworldwide production exceeded 2500 million tons in 20088. It can be blended with \n\ndiesel fuel to be used in conventional engines9 and is able to reduce the carbon dioxide \n\nemissions by 78 %10. Although most commercially available biodiesel is still between 5 \n\nand 20 % biodiesel blended with petroleum diesel due to the higher prices of feedstocks \n\nfor biodiesel production the tendency of increasing production is expected to continue \n\nin the coming decades with the development and the growth of non-food feedstocks11. \n\nOne of the major problems associated with biodiesel is that its viscosity may be \n\nhigher than that for diesel fuel. A fuel of high viscosity tends to form larger droplets on \n\ninjection, leading to poorer atomization during the spray and creating operation \n\nproblems, such as increased carbon deposits12, and may enhance the polymerization \n\nreaction especially for oils of high degree of unsaturation13. It also leads to poor \n\ncombustion and increased exhaust smoke and emissions, beyond the problems in cold \n\nweather due to the increase of viscosity with decreasing temperature. On the other hand, \n\na fuel with low viscosity may not provide sufficient lubrication for the precision fit of \n\nfuel injection pumps, resulting in leakage or increased wear14. Thus the kinematic \n\nviscosity of biodiesel at 40 \u00baC, must be in the range of 3.5-5.0 mm2/s according to EN-\n\n14214 specifications in Europe and of 1.9-6.0 mm2/s in accordance with American \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n138 \n\n \n\nSociety of Testing and Materials (ASTM) D-6751 specifications in the USA15 while the \n\nlimit for diesel fuel is 2.0-4.5 mm2/s14. \n\nThere is still a lack of viscosity data of biodiesel blends and biodiesel-diesel over the \n\nwhole composition range at different operational conditions of pressure and \n\ntemperature. In this regard, the use of theoretical approaches to estimate the viscosity of \n\nbiodiesel systems is of great practical interest. \n\nA number of works has presented predictive models and empirical equations with \n\nadjustable parameters for the viscosity of fatty acid esters, of which biodiesel is \n\ncomprised. By knowing the viscosity of fatty acid esters, it is possible to determine the \n\nviscosity of biodiesel using the mixture models suggested by Grunberg-Nissan or \n\nHind12. Moreover there is a possibility to realize biodiesel maximum potential by \n\nsimply changing the composition of fatty acid esters. \n\nThis paper aims at comparing the predictive capabilities of three models developed \n\nrespectively by Ceriani et al.16, Krisnangkura et al.13 and Yuan et al.17 for the estimation \n\nof the viscosity of several biodiesel and their blends with diesel fuels. A revised version \n\nof the Yuan model is also proposed and evaluated. \n\n \n\n2 Experimental Section \n\n2.1 Samples \n\nIn this work the viscosities of seven biodiesel samples were measured. Two of \n\nthese samples were obtained from Portuguese biodiesel producers, namely Soy A and \n\nGP (mix of soy and rapeseed methyl esters at 50 % w/w). B1 is methyl oleate of \n\ntechnical grade, 70 %, supplied by Sigma. \n\nThe other four biodiesel samples: Sunflower, Soy B, Palm and Rapeseed were \n\nsynthesized in our laboratory by a transesterification reaction of the respective vegetal \n\noils. The molar ratio of oil/methanol used was 1:5 with 0.5 % sodium hydroxide by \n\nweight of oil as catalyst. The reaction was performed at 55 \u00baC during 24 h under \n\nmethanol reflux. The reaction time chosen was adopted for convenience and to \n\nguarantee a complete reaction conversion. Raw glycerol was removed in two steps, the \n\nfirst after 3 h reaction and then after 24 h reaction in a separating funnel. Biodiesel was \n\npurified by washing with hot distillated water until a neutral pH was achieved. Then \n\n\n\n \n\n139 \n\n \n\nbiodiesel was dried until the EN ISO 12937 limit for water was reached (less than 500 \n\nmg/kg of water). Some properties of produced biodiesel are presented in Table 1. \n\nTable 1.

The temperature uncertainty is 0.02 K from (288.15 to \n\n378.15) K. The relative uncertainty of the dynamic viscosity obtained is less than 0.5 % \n\nfor the standard fluid SHL120 (SH Calibration Service GMbH), in the range of the \n\nstudied temperatures. This viscometer was previously tested for other compounds and \n\npresented a very good reproducibility18,19. \n\n \n\n3. Viscosity models  \n\nThe models here described are valid for the estimation viscosity of mixtures of \n\nfatty acid alkyl esters. The viscosities of biodiesel are calculated by using the equation \n\nof Grunberg-Nissan which is known to be the most suitable equation for computing the \n\nviscosity of liquid mixtures12,17. Given that biodiesel fuels are non-associated liquids, \n\ni.e., they have essentially dispersive interaction between the individual components, \n\ntheir dynamic viscosity can be estimated using the following equation: \n\nln ?? = ? !\"#\"$? %&amp; ?\"         (1) \nwhere ?i is the dynamic viscosity of individual compound, ?m the dynamic viscosity of \n\nthe mixture and xi the mole fraction. \n\nThe ester nomenclature adopted on this work is based on the fatty acid chain length. \n\nA Cx:y ester means the methyl ester of fatty acid with x carbons and y unsaturation. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n140 \n\n \n\n3.1- Ceriani\u2019s Model  \n\nCeriani et al.16 proposed a model to predict the viscosity of fatty acid esters \n\nbased on a group contribution method, i.e., a compound or a mixture of compounds is \n\nconsidered as a solution of groups and its properties are the sum of the contributions of \n\neach group16. The model for the pure compounds is described in Equations (2) \u2013 (4):  \n\n%&amp;'?\" ()?. +? - = ? .? /??? +\n0??\n1 2? ? 4?? %&amp; ? 5 ? \n?? ? 5?? 6? + 7?\" ? .? /??? +?\n\n0??\n1 2? ? 4?? %&amp; ? 5 ? \n?? ? 5?? 68 + 9       (2) \n\nwith \n\n9 = ':; + .&lt;:?-= + '+; + .<> +?-       (3) \n\nand \n\n= = ? + @1/2 ? Bln '? 5- ? C ? 5??        (4) \n\nwhere Nk is the number of groups k in the molecule i; M is the component molecular \n\nweight that multiplies the \u201cperturbation term\u201d; A1k, B1k, C1k, D1k, A2k, B2k, C2k, and D2k \n\nare parameters obtained from the regression of the experimental data; k represents the \n\ngroups of component i; Q is a correction term. f0, f1, s0 and s1 are optimized constants; ?, \n\n?, ? and ? are optimized parameters obtained by regression of databank as whole; Nc is \n\nthe total number of carbon atoms in the molecule and Ncs is the number of carbons of \n\nthe alcohol side chain. The parameter values can be found at Ceriani et al.16. \n\n \n\n3.2- Krisnangkura\u2019s Model  \n\nKrisnangkura et al.13 fitted Equation 5 to an experimental viscosity data bank and \n\nprovided a set of parameters for the description of the viscosity of pure fatty acid methyl \n\nesters (FAMEs)13. \n\nln'D- = ? + EF +&lt;1 +\nGH\n1            (5) \n\nThis equation was developed by considering the viscosity as the integral of the \n\ninteraction forces of molecules. Based on this approach the temperature dependency of \nthe viscosity for short chain methyl esters (C6-C12) can be estimated by Equation 6: \n\nln'D- = ?2.915 ? 0.158F + NO?.??1 +\n?;P.?QG\n\n1       (6) \n\n\n\n \n\n141 \n\n \n\nwhile for longer chain esters (C12:0-C18:0) the viscosity obeys the Equation 7: \n\nln'D- = ?2.177 ? 0.202F + N;?.??1 +\n?;O.SSG\n\n1       (7) \n\nThe viscosity of unsaturated FAMEs is estimated by Equations (8) - (11). \n\nln'D-?P:? = ?5.03 +\n?;Q?.Q\n\n1         (8) \n\nln'D-?P:? = ?4.51 +\n?P??.Q\n\n1         (9) \n\nln'D-?P:? = ?4.18 +\n??PQ.Q\n\n1         (10) \n\nln'D-??:? = ?5.42 +\n????.?\n\n1         (11) \n\nIn all these equations \u00b5 is kinematic viscosity expressed in mm2/s and T is absolute \n\ntemperature in K. \n\nSince Krisnangkura\u2019s model does not provide equations for several unsaturated \n\nFAMEs such as C16:1, C20:0, C20:1 and C22:1, to predict the viscosity of biodiesel \n\ncontaining these compounds, it was necessary to resort to a pseudo-component \n\napproach where the biodiesel composition was modified by adding C16:1 to C16:0, C20:0 \n\nand C20:1 to C18:3 and C22:0 to C22:1. \n\nBeyond that, given that Krisnangkura\u2019s model provides only kinematic viscosities, \n\ntheir conversion into dynamic viscosities was done by considering the density data for \n\npure FAMEs reported by Pratas et al.18,20 \n\n \n\n3.3- Yuan\u2019s Model  \n\nYuan et al.17 applied the Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF) equation to describe the \n\nviscosity-temperature relationship of pure FAME commonly present in biodiesel fuels  \n\nln ? ()?. +? = ? + 01/2W1X        (12) \n\nand then estimate the viscosity of biodiesel fuels based on their FAME composition \n\nthrough the mixture model. In Equation (12) A, B and To are parameters with values \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n142 \n\n \n\nwere determined by fitting experimental viscosity data available and are reported by \n\nYuan et al.17 \n\n3.4- Revised Yuan\u2019s Model  \n\nIn previous works Pratas et al.18,20 reported new and more accurate data for the \n\nviscosities of fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters. The revised Yuan\u2019s model consists of a \n\nversion of the Yuan\u2019s model where the parameters of the VTF model were refitted to \n\nthe new data.

To apply the models \n\nhere studied detailed information about the biodiesel composition is required. The \n\ndatabase used in this work was collected from the literature and supplemented with a \n\n\n\n \n\n143 \n\n \n\ndata for seven new biodiesel measured in our laboratory. The compositions in terms of \n\nFAMEs of all biodiesel used in this work are reported in Table 3. The biodiesels used in \n\nthis study cover the most important oils used in biodiesel production such as soy, palm, \n\ncanola, rapeseed and sunflower, but also other oils such as cotton seed, coconut and \n\nbabassu, relevant due to their singular compositions. In terms of fatty acid methyl ester \n\ndistributions it addresses both oils rich in short chain and saturated fatty acids such as \n\ncoconut, in saturated fractions such as palm, and rich in unsaturated compounds such as \n\nsoy and sunflower. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n144 \n\n \n\nTable 3.

As one can see in Figures 1a and 1d, the predictions of Ceriani\u2019s and \n\nKrisnangkura\u2019s model are systematically larger than the Yuan type models (Figures 1b \n\nand 1c) and temperature dependent. Note, however, this dependency is opposite in the \n\ntwo cases: while Ceriani\u2019s deviations tend to increase with temperature, the reverse \n\neffect is observed for Krisnangkura\u2019s model, i.e., the deviations are lower at the higher \n\ntemperatures, where the viscosities have lower values. In both cases, the deviations at \n\nthe temperature extremes tend to be very large (up to 25 %). The temperature \n\ndependency of Ceriani\u2019s model seems to be related with the poor description of the \n\nviscosity of unsaturated fatty acid esters as discussed in previous works.18,20 A \n\nreestimation of the parameters for these compounds should allow a better description of \n\nthe experimental viscosities. The temperature dependency of the fatty acid esters is \n\nbetter described in large temperature ranges by a Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF) \n\nequation, as suggested by Yuan\u2019s et al.17 than by the Arrhenius type adopted by \n\nKrisnangkura. The poor temperature dependency of this model is due to the equation \n\nused to describe temperature dependency of the viscosity of the pure components of the \n\nmixture. \n\nFigures 1b and 1c reveals that the relative deviations obtained with the two versions \n\nof the Yuan model are temperature independent and the maximum deviation observed \n\nare in general lower than 10 %. They are thus more robust and reliable, producing \n\nsuitable average deviations in comparison with other models available in the literature. \n\nIn numbers, both Ceriani\u2019s and Krisnangkura\u2019s models have global average relative \n\ndeviations around 8 %, Yuan\u2019s original model of 5.3 % and the revised version of \n\nYuan\u2019s model here proposed of just 4.7 % that must be close to the experimental \n\nuncertainty of many of the experimental data. \n\n\n\n \n\n151 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(continued in next page) \n\n-35.00\n-30.00\n-25.00\n-20.00\n-15.00\n-10.00\n-5.00\n\n.00\n5.00\n\n10.00\n15.00\n\n270 290 310 330 350 370 390\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n.(\n\n?? ??\nc\na\n\nlc\n- ?? ??\n\ne\nx\n\np\n)/\n\n?? ??\ne\n\nx\np\n\nT[K]\n\n-20.00\n\n-15.00\n\n-10.00\n\n-5.00\n\n.00\n\n5.00\n\n10.00\n\n270 290 310 330 350 370 390\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n.(\n\n?? ??\nc\na\n\nlc\n- ?? ??\n\ne\nx\n\np\n)/\n\n?? ??\ne\n\nx\np\n\nT [K]\n\n-25.00\n\n-20.00\n\n-15.00\n\n-10.00\n\n-5.00\n\n.00\n\n5.00\n\n10.00\n\n270 290 310 330 350 370 390\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n.(\n\n?? ??\nc\na\n\nlc\n- ?? ??\n\ne\nx\n\np\n)/\n\n?? ??\ne\n\nx\np\n\nT [ K]\n\nA \n\nB \n\nC \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n152 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2a.

The relative deviations were estimated using Equations \n\n(13) and (14) and are reported in Table 7. It was found that the deviations observed for \n\nthe individual mixtures and the global deviations are in good agreement with those \n\nobserved for the pure biodiesel, showing that their predictive capabilities of the \n\napproach here used is not affected by the presence of hydrocarbons in the mixture. \n\nCeriani\u2019s model shows an overall deviation of 6.47 %, Yuan\u2019s and Krisnangkura\u2019s \n\nmodels presented 5.59 % and 7.10 % respectively, while the revised Yuan\u2019s model had \n\nthe lowest global deviation of just 5.21 %, suggesting that the Yuan type models are \n\nalso suitable to predict the viscosity data of biodiesel blends with petrodiesel. \n\n \n \n\n-35.00\n\n-30.00\n\n-25.00\n\n-20.00\n\n-15.00\n\n-10.00\n\n-5.00\n\n.00\n\n5.00\n\n10.00\n\n270 290 310 330 350 370 390\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n.(\n\n?? ??\ne\n\nx\np\n- ?? ??\n\nc\na\n\nlc\n)/\n\n?? ??\ne\n\nx\np\n\nT [K]\n\nD \n\n\n\n \n\n153 \n\n \n\nTable 7.

Conclusions \n\nViscosity data for seven well characterized biodiesel samples in terms of its FAME \n\ncomposition was measured and reported. Along with a database compiled from the \n\nliterature, they were used to evaluate four models able to predict biodiesel viscosities \n\nbased on information of their FAME compositions. It is shown that although all the \n\nmodels studied are able to predict the viscosities of both pure biodiesels and blends of \n\nbiodiesel with petrodiesel with less than 10 % deviation in general, the models of \n\nKrisnangkura et al.13 and Ceriani et al.16 present deviations that are temperature \n\ndependent and that at the extremes of the temperature range studied can have deviations \n\nas high as 25 %. The deviations presented by the Yuan type models are more robust \n\nover temperature and also lower than those obtained with the two previous models. In \n\nparticular the revised version of the Yuan\u2019s model here proposed based on new and \n\nmore accurate data for the fatty acid methyl esters produces predictions with \n\nuncertainties that are close to the experimental uncertainties of the experimental data \n\nand can thus be an interesting tool to the design of biofuels or biofuel blends with \n\nviscosities that comply with legal specifications. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n155 \n\n \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n[1] Knothe, G.; Steidley, K.

INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nBiodiesel production and consumption has been increasing steadily in the last few \n\nyears thanks to the environmental benefits that result from its utilization. The cost of the \n\nraw materials and the competition with food for oils or soils are the main limitations to \n\na more widespread use of biodiesel. The use of waste oil or cheap and non-edible oils \n\nand fats can help minimize this problem but the formulation of a biodiesel must \n\nconform to a number of standards before approval for commercialization. \n\nThe main biodiesel properties are dependent on the oils or fats used on its production. \n\nThis biofuel is much less complex than conventional diesels. It consists on a liquid \n\nblend of, non toxic, biodegradable fatty acid esters, yellow coloured and immiscible \n\nwith water. Its cold flow performance depends both on the oil and the alcohol used in \n\nthe transesterification. A biodiesel with a large concentration of saturated fatty acid \n\nesters, although less vulnerable to oxidation and displaying better combustion \n\nproperties, has a worst performance at low temperatures because of its tendency to \n\ncrystallize1. There are a number of specifications for the biodiesel performance at low \n\ntemperatures. The most important are the Cloud Point, CP, the Pour Point, PP, the Cold \n\nFilter Plugging Point, CFPP, and the Low Temperature Filterability Test, LTFT2. Dunn \n\nand co-workers have produced a large body of work that provides a comprehensive \n\npicture of the influence of the saturated fatty esters and various alcohols on the low \n\ntemperature behaviour of biodiesel1, 3-8. What currently lacks is a good and reliable \n\nmodel that, from the knowledge of the biodiesel composition, could predict the low \n\ntemperature behavior of the fuel8. This model would be an essential tool for a quick \n\nevaluation of the biodiesel characteristics, design of a biodiesel to meet the \n\nrequirements for low temperature utilization, and design and operation of winterization \n\nprocesses for biodiesels9. \n\nOur previous work has addressed the low temperature behavior of conventional fuels. \n\nA thermodynamic model, Predictive UNIQUAC10-15, was developed and extensively \n\ntested in diesels16-18, jet fuels and other refined products17, 19-21and unrefined oils22-25 \n\nwith success. Lately we have been addressing the application of this model to the \n\ndescription of the cloud points of fatty acid mixtures26, and fatty acid methyl27 and ethyl \n\nester28 mixtures. The Predictive UNIQUAC model was shown to be able to successfully \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n166 \n\n \n\ndescribe the cloud point of the mixtures studied but presented limited advantages \n\ncompared to a simpler model where no solid solution formation was considered as \n\ndiscussed in a previous work28.  \n\nThe cloud point provides, however, a limited information about the low temperature \n\nbehavior of a fuel. Both the CFPP and the LTFT are related to what happens below the \n\ncloud point, i.e. the composition of the material that precipitates and the amount of \n\ncrystals formed. This last issue is particularly relevant as the gelling of the fluid and the \n\nplugging of filters is essentially dependent on the amount of solids crystallizing at low \n\ntemperatures. The adequate design and operation of winterization processes to produce \n\nbiodiesel that can conform to low temperature specifications also requires the capability \n\nto predict the composition of the liquid phase after partial crystallization of a biodiesel \n\nand the prediction of its new low temperature characteristics9, 29-31. To learn more about \n\nthe behavior of a biodiesel below its cloud point an approach successfully used \n\npreviously for the study of conventional diesels16, 18and other complex synthetic \n\nmixtures12, 32-36 was here applied to biodiesels. It consists in separating by filtration the \n\nliquid and solid phases at various temperatures below the cloud point and study their \n\ncomposition and relative amounts. \n\nIn this work experimental data for the solid liquid phase equilibria of three \n\ncommercial non-additivate biodiesels at temperatures ranging from 260 to 275 K are \n\nreported. A thermodynamic framework able to describe these multiphase systems is \n\npresented. Two versions of the Predictive UNIQUAC model along with a model \n\nassuming complete immiscibility of the compounds on the solid phase are evaluated \n\nwith success against the experimental data as shown below. \n\n \n\n2. EXPERIMENTAL \n\n \n\nThe three commercial biodiesels here studied, BDA, BDB and BDC, were obtained \n\nfrom Portuguese biodiesel producing companies. They were collected at the end of the \n\nproduction line before additivation and their composition was measured by gas \n\nchromatography on a Varian 3800CP chromatograph equipped with a split/splitless \n\ninjector at 250\u00baC (split ratio of 1:20) and a FID detector at 220\u00baC. A DB1-HT column \n\n(length: 15m, internal diameter: 0.32mm and film thickness: 0.1\u00b5m) coated with a film \n\nof dimethylpolysiloxane, with a temperature program of 5 \u00baC/min from 80 \u00baC to 200 \u00baC \n\n\n\n \n\n167 \n\n \n\nwas used. The carrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 2mL/min. The compositions of \n\nthe fatty acid esters present in concentrations above 0.5 wt% are reported in Table 1. \n\nThe total concentration of other esters was less than 2 wt%. \n\n \n\nTable 1. Composition (wt%) and Cloud Points of the biodiesel studied. \n\n BDA BDB BDC \n\nC16:0 16.18 5.59 11.04 \n\nC18:0 3.82 2.39 4.07 \n\nC18:1 28.80 55.20 22.92 \n\nC18:2 50.46 34.89 61.03 \n\nCloud Point / K 280 271 276 \n\n \n\nThe low temperature behavior of the biodiesels was studied using a methodology \n\npreviously developed by us to measure solid liquid phase equilibria in hydrocarbon \n\nfluids12, 32 and widely used to the study of both synthetic mixtures12, 33-36 and diesels16, \n\n18. It consists in separating the liquid phase from the precipitate by filtration at \n\ncontrolled temperature and analyzing the phases by gas chromatography. The phase \n\nseparation is achieved using UniPrep syringeless filters from Whatman of 5 mL \n\ncapacity with filters of 0.2\u00b5m porosity. The biodiesel is distributed in 1 mL samples by \n\nthe UniPrep that are introduced on a thermostatic bath where the samples are \n\nequilibrated for 24 hours before separation. When the separation is completed, the two \n\nphases recovered are analyzed using the gas chromatography analytical procedure \n\ndescribed above. The liquid and solid phase composition and fractions are estimated by \n\nmass balances from the results of these analysis according to a procedure proposed \n\npreviously12, 32 and detailed below. No multiple measurements were carried for each \n\npoint so a correct value of reproducibility of the experimental data cannot be assigned. \n\nBased on our previous experience12, 32-36 and on the results for the points that were \n\nduplicated the estimated reproducibility is of 1% on the liquid phase composition, 5% \n\non the solid phase composition and 5-10% on the solid fraction. \n\nThe precipitate (P) recovered is composed by the solid phase (S) and important \n\nquantities of liquid (L) that remain entrapped in the crystals after the filtration. It is thus \n\nimpossible to assess directly the composition of the solid phase after the filtration. Only \n\nthe composition of the liquid phase (L) and the precipitate (P) can be determined \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n168 \n\n \n\ndirectly. Since the unsaturated fatty acid esters have melting points much lower than the \n\ncorresponding saturated fatty acid esters they will not crystallize at the temperatures \n\nused on this study and thus the portion of liquid entrapped in the crystals of the \n\nprecipitate can be determined from the quantity of unsaturated fatty esters present in the \n\nprecipitate. Since the exact composition of the liquid phase is known from \n\nchromatography it is possible to calculate the fraction of entrapped liquid, c, as: \n\nL\nC\n\nL\nC\n\nP\nC\n\nP\nC\n\nWW\n\nWW\nc\n\n2:181:18\n\n2:181:18\n\n+\n+\n\n=                                                                                                         (1) \n\nwhere W are the mass fraction of the compounds obtained from the chromatographic \n\nanalysis and P and L stand for the precipitate and the liquid fractions. Using the value of \n\nthis fraction c it is possible to estimate the composition of the various compounds i \n\npresent in the solid phase, S, as \n\nc\n\ncWW\nW\n\nL\ni\n\nP\niS\n\ni ?\n?\n\n=\n1\n\n                                                                                                        (2) \n\nThe fraction of the initial biodiesel sample that crystallized, XS, can be obtained from \n\na mass balance to any of the compounds present but is ideally estimated from the \n\nconcentration of any of the unsaturated fatty acid esters on both the original biodiesel, \n\nBD, and the concentration in the liquid phase, L, under the conditions studied as \n\nL\ni\n\nBD\ni\n\nL\niS\n\nW\n\nWW\nX\n\n?\n=                                                                                                         (3) \n\nThis experimental methodology allows an easy measurement of the composition of \n\nthe liquid, WL, and solid phases, WS, as well as the fraction of crystallized material, XS, \n\nas function of the temperature.  \n\n \n\n3. THERMODYNAMIC MODEL \n\n \n\nThe precipitation of solids in biodiesel at low temperatures is described using an \n\napproach previously proposed by us for alkane mixtures 10-25 and also applied to fatty \n\nacids26, and fatty acids methyl and ethyl esters27, 28 with success. \n\nThe solid-liquid equilibrium can be described by an equation relating the composition \n\nof component i in the solid and liquid phases with their non ideality, and the \n\nthermophysical properties of the pure component37  \n\n\n\n \n\n169 \n\n \n\n??\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n+?\n\n?\n???\n\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n=\n\nT\n\nT\n\nT\n\nT\n\nR\n\nTC\n\nT\n\nT\n\nRT\n\nH\n\nx\n\nx ifusifusifusipifus\n\nifus\n\nifus\n\nl\ni\n\nl\ni\n\ns\ni\n\ns\ni ,,,,fus,\n\n,\n\nln1\n)(\n\n1ln\n?\n?\n\n                            (4) \n\nwhere ?i is the activity coefficient of the compound, xi its mole fraction, )( fusfus TH?  the \n\nmolar enthalpy of fusion of the pure solute at the melting temperature Tfus, and \n\n)( ,,fus ifusip TC?  the molar heat capacity change upon fusion, at fusion temperature Tfus. \n\nThe heat capacity change upon fusion is usually regarded as being independent of the \n\ntemperature and the bracketed term multiplied with mp,fusC? is often considered as being \n\nsmall, as the opposite signs inside the bracket lead to near cancellation38. This term was \n\nthus neglected on the calculations. The thermophysical properties of the crystallizing \n\nsaturated fatty acid esters used were obtained from correlations developed in a previous \n\nwork27 and are reported in Table 2. \n\n \n\nTable 2.

Using Eq. (1), along with a \n\nmultiphase flash algorithm, the composition and amount of the phases in equilibrium \n\ncan be calculated if a model for the non-ideality of the solid phases is available. Due to \n\nits simplicity and robustness the algorithm of resolution of the Rachford-Rice equations \n\nproposed by Leivobici and Neoschil39 was used in the calculations.  \n\nThe solid phase non-ideality is described by the most recent version of the Predictive \n\nUNIQUAC model15. The UNIQUAC model can be written as \n\n? ???\n= === ?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n? ?\n??\n\n?\n+??\n\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n? ?\n=\n\nn\n\ni\n\nn\n\nj i\n\niiij\njii\n\nn\n\ni i\n\ni\nii\n\nn\n\ni i\n\ni\ni\n\nE\n\nRTq\nqxxq\n\nZ\n\nx\nx\n\nRT\n\ng\n\n1 111\n\nexplnln\n2\n\nln\n??\n\n?\n?\n\n                   (5) \n\nwith \n\n?\n=?\n\nj\njj\n\nii\ni\n\nrx\n\nrx\n    and     \n\n?\n=\n\nj\njj\n\nii\ni\n\nqx\n\nqx\n?

The pair \n\ninteraction energies between two identical molecules are estimated from the heat of \n\nsublimation of the pure component, \n\n( )RTH\nZ\n\nisubii ???=\n2\n\n?                                                                                               (7) \n\nwhere Z is the coordination number with a value of 10 as in the original UNIQUAC \n\nmodel15, 41. The heats of sublimation are calculated at the melting temperature of the \n\npure component as \n\n?subH=?vapH+?fusH                                                                                                  (8) \n\nThe pair interaction energy between two non-identical molecules is given by  \n\n( )ijjjjiij ???? +== 1                                                                                                  (9) \nwhere j is the ester with the shorter chain of the pair ij. The interaction parameter ?ij \n\nallows the tuning of the non ideality of the solid solution. In this work three approaches \n\nto the solid phase non ideality will be evaluated: assuming ?ij=0 (UNIQUAC) as was \n\npreviously done for alkanes10-25; using ?ij=-0.05 (UNIQUAC -0.05) , a value similar to \n\nthat used on the description of the phase diagrams of fatty acids26 and fatty acid esters27; \n\nand finally assuming that there is no solid solution formation and each compound \n\ncrystallizes as a pure crystal (No solution). This last situation corresponds to an infinite \n\nvalue of the solid phase activity coefficient that within the framework of Predictive \n\nUNIQUAC can be achieved with a value of ?ij larger than -0.25. \n\nThe solid-liquid equilibrium model used in this work is thus a purely predictive model \n\nthat uses only pure component properties for the calculation of the phase equilibria. The \n\nthree versions here evaluated will be used to predict the low temperature behavior of the \n\nthree biodiesels studied in this work42.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n171 \n\n \n\n \n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n \n\nThe experimental methodology used on this work provides direct information about \n\nthe composition of the liquid phase. The compositions of the solid phase are estimated \n\nfrom the composition of the liquid phase and the precipitate according to Eqs. (1) and \n\n(2). The fraction of solids crystallizing from the biodiesel at each temperature is \n\nobtained from the differences between the concentrations of the unsaturated fatty acid \n\nesters on the original biodiesel and on the liquid phase according to Eq. (3). It follows \n\nthat the uncertainty associated to the solid phase compositions and the solid fractions is \n\nconsequently larger than that of the liquid phase, which is just the uncertainty associated \n\nto the GC analysis. The compositions of the liquid and solid phases along with the solid \n\nfraction formed are reported on Tables 3 to 5 at the various temperatures studied for \n\neach of the biodiesels used on this work. These values along with the predictions \n\nachieved by the three studied models are presented in Figures 1 to 9. \n\n \n\nTable 3.

Dependence with the temperature of the fraction of precipitated solid material \n\nfor BDC. \n\n \n\nSince the lowest temperature studied was 260.65 K and the melting points of the \n\nunsaturated fatty acid esters present on the biodiesel are lower than this value it was \n\nadmitted that these compounds did not crystallize under the conditions used in this \n\nwork. The solid phase is thus composed solely by the saturated fatty acid methyl esters, \n\nmethyl palmitate (C16:0) and methyl stearate (C18:0). The temperature dependency of \n\nthe liquid phase compositions observed for all the biodiesels is similar as shown in \n\nFigures 1, 4 and 7. As the temperature decreases the saturated esters crystallize and then \n\nthe liquid phase becomes depleted on the saturated esters and enriched on the \n\nunsaturated esters. This results on an increase of the unsaturated esters concentration at \n\nlow temperatures while the saturated esters show the opposite behavior with a decrease \n\nin concentration with temperature. In what concerns the description of the liquid phase \n\ncompositions the three models adopted have quite similar performances providing a \n\ndescription of the data that is essentially within their experimental uncertainty.  \n\nThe solid phase compositions presented in Figures 2, 5 and 8 display a richer and \n\nmore complex behavior becoming a more stringent test to the models. Although the \n\nmodels predict a similar solid phase composition at temperatures 5 to 10 K lower than \n\nthe cloud point, close to it they display a very different behavior.

This produces some interesting \n\nfeatures on the phase equilibria predicted by the No solution model such as a small \n\nincrease on the concentration of the methyl stearate on the liquid phase below the cloud \n\npoint and down to 276 K for BDA while the methyl palmitate crystallizes alone.  \n\nThe kinks observed on the solid fraction lines predicted by this model and reported in \n\nFigures 3, 6 and 9 can also be assigned to the change of regimen of crystallization of a \n\nsingle ester to the simultaneous crystallization of two esters. In any case these behaviors \n\nwould be too subtle to be observed on the experimental data to test the model validity. \n\nThe Predictive UNIQUAC model with ?ij=-0.05 (UNIQUAC -0.05) presents an \n\nintermediate behavior between these two extremes. While it clearly favors the \n\ncrystallization of one of the esters over the other at the cloud point it still predicts \n\nnevertheless that there is always some degree of co-crystallization. This allows the \n\ncorrect description of the decrease in methyl palmitate and increase in methyl stearate \n\nconcentrations as the temperature decreases observed in BDA. The UNIQUAC model \n\npredicts the opposite behavior for all the studied biofuels, while the No solution model, \n\nalthough qualitatively correct, overestimates this composition change. This change in \n\nthe solid phase composition is particularly visible for BDB shown in Figure 5. Because \n\nin BDB the methyl palmitate to methyl stearate ratio is much lower than in the two \n\nother fuels the crystallization will start on the opposite side of the eutectic point than the \n\nobserved in BDA and BDC. This originates that at the cloud point it will be the methyl \n\nstearate, rather than the methyl palmitate that dominates in the solid phase. This peculiar \n\nbehavior is rather clear in the experimental data with an inversion of the dominant ester \n\nin the solid phase as the temperature decreases.  \n\nAlthough all the models can qualitatively describe the change in the dominant ester \n\npresent in the solid phase the UNIQUAC model fails to adequately describe it while the \n\ntwo other models provide a fair description of the concentration inversion. On BDC, \n\npresented on Figure 8, the UNIQUAC model again fails to provide a description of the \n\n\n\n \n\n179 \n\n \n\nqualitative trend observed in the solid phase compositions. The two other models show \n\nno differences within the experimental temperature range studied. \n\nThe crystallization differences around the cloud point, along with the differences on \n\nthe estimation of the cloud point itself, generate important differences on the solid \n\nfractions predicted by the three models studied on this work reported on Figures 3, 6 \n\nand 9. The solid fraction, as well as the cloud point estimation, decreases with the \n\nincreasing non ideality of the solid phase. In all cases the solid fractions predicted by \n\nthe UNIQUAC model are larger than those estimated by the UNIQUAC -0.05 and these \n\nlarger than those obtained from the No solution model. It is clear that the UNIQUAC \n\nmodel overestimates the solid fractions measured. Given the quality of the experimental \n\ndata measured for the solid fractions it is not possible to clearly identify which of the \n\ntwo other models is the best since both describe the data within its experimental \n\nuncertainty.  \n\nA global analysis of the data suggests that both the UNIQUAC -0.05 and the No \n\nsolution model can provide an adequate description of the phase equilibrium data of \n\nbiodiesels below the cloud point of the fuel. The UNIQUAC -0.05 model is probably \n\nsuperior with a better description of the cloud point and of the solid phase composition. \n\nA more extensive set of data and of higher quality seems to be required to reach a final \n\nconclusion.  \n\n \n\n5. CONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\nThis work reports experimental data for the solid liquid phase equilibria of three \n\ncommercial, non-additivate, biodiesels at temperatures ranging from 260 to 275 K. A \n\nthermodynamic framework able to describe these multiphase systems is presented. Two \n\nversions of the Predictive UNIQUAC model along with a model assuming complete \n\nimmiscibility of the compounds in the solid phase are evaluated against the \n\nexperimental data measured. It is shown that both the Predictive UNIQUAC model with \n\n?ij=-0.05 (UNIQUAC -0.05) and a model assuming complete immiscibility on the solid \n\nphase are capable of providing an adequate representation of the phase equilibria for \n\nthese systems below their cloud points. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n180 \n\n \n\n \n\nREFERENCES  \n\n[1]  Dunn, R.O.; Bagby, M.O.

A number of important \n\nproperties of the biodiesel can be directly related to the chemical composition of the raw \n\nmaterial. It is therefore possible to predict these properties for each biodiesel based on \n\ntheir fatty acid profile. \n\nThe aim of this work is to study the biodiesel properties dependence with \n\ncomposition. To have a database to perform this study we synthesized methyl esters of \n\nrapeseed, soybean and palm as also their binary mixtures and ternary mixture, and also \n\nsunflower biodiesel. The properties evaluated were density, viscosity, iodine index, and \n\nCFPP. The objective of this study is to evaluate the properties of biodiesel oils obtained \n\nfrom different feedstock (soybean, rapeseed, palm, sunflower) and also their mixtures. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKEYWORDS: Biodiesel, Properties, Composition dependence, Density, Viscosity, \n\nCFPP, Iodine Value. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n191 \n\n \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nThe fossil fuel resources are dwindling day by day. Oil is becoming increasingly \n\nscarce and soon will not be able to meet the numerous demands, arising mainly from the \n\ntransport sector. Faced with the energy crisis and environmental degradation, due to the \n\nmassive use of fossil energy sources, biodiesel became an attractive alternative to diesel \n\nfuel. Biodiesel can reduce the environmental impacts of transportation, reduce the \n\ndependence on crude oil imports and thus on related political and economic factors, they \n\noffer business possibilities to agricultural enterprises.1 \n\nA substitute diesel fuel derived from vegetable oils or animal fats, biodiesel is a \n\nmixture of saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acid alkyl esters. It is the final \n\nproduct of a transesterification reaction of vegetal oil, with a short alcohol in a presence \n\nof a catalyst. Industrially the most used process is the alkaline-catalyzed reaction. \n\nThe biodiesel fuel has to fulfill a number of quality standards. In Europe the biodiesel \n\nfuel standards are compiled in the norm CEN EN 142142, and in USA in the norm \n\nASTM D67513. The norms specify the requirements and test methods for biodiesel fuel \n\nto be used in diesel engines, in order to increase the biodiesel fuel quality and its \n\nacceptance among consumers. According to the European legislation, there are 25 \n\nparameters that have to be analyzed to certify biodiesel quality. Most of these analytical \n\nparameters provide indications of the quality of the production process. Some others \n\nreflect the properties of the raw materials that are used to produce the biodiesel. The \n\ntransesterification does not alter the fatty acid composition of the feedstock and this \n\ncomposition plays an important role in some critical parameters of the biodiesel.4 \n\nProperties such as density, viscosity, low temperature performance, flash point, cetane \n\nnumber, iodine index, or oxidative stability depend on the fatty acid esters profile. \n\nThe biodiesel has a poor cold-temperature performance and a low oxidative stability, \n\nincreased NO, and exhausts emissions. Solutions to one of these problems often entail \n\nincreasing the problematic behavior of another property and require the use of additives \n\nor modifying the fatty acid composition, either through physical processes, such as \n\nwinterization, or through changes in the raw materials.5 6 In this regard, the generation \n\nof transgenic soybean lines with high oleic acid content represents one way in which \n\nplant biotechnology has already contributed to the improvement of biodiesel.6 Viable \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n192 \n\n \n\nstrategies for increasing oil production in seeds have also been demonstrated, although \n\nadditional work is necessary to translate these to yield increases in the field. In addition, \n\nresearch at an early stage has also suggested ways of producing oil in vegetative tissue \n\nrather than in seeds. Combining these approaches to develop high-yielding energy crops \n\nwill increase the production of plant oils suitable for biodiesel.6  \n\nIn order to test several fatty acid ester profile different biodiesels were synthesis and \n\nevaluated in this work. Fatty acid methyl esters of soybean, rapeseed, palm oils and \n\ntheir mixtures (binary and ternary) and also, sunflower were synthesized. The quality of \n\nbiodiesel was tested for some parameters according to the European Standard EN \n\n14214:20032. \n\nA special importance is here given to critical properties that depend on fatty acid \n\nprofile of raw material as density, viscosity, iodine value, and cold filter plugging point \n\n(CFPP). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n193 \n\n \n\n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\nMaterials. The eight biodiesel samples studied in this work were synthesized at our \n\nlaboratory by a transesterification reaction of the vegetal oils: Soybean (S), Rapeseed \n\n(R), and Palm (P), and their respective binary and ternary mixtures: Soybean+Rapeseed \n\n(SR), Rapeseed+Palm (RP), Soybean+Palm (SP), and Soybean+Rapeseed +Palm (SRP) \n\nand Sunflower (Sf). Methanol (99.9% m/m) was purchased from Lab-scan, and all other \n\nchemicals used were obtained commercially and were of analytical grade. \n\n \n\nTransesterification process \n\nThe transesterification reaction for all biodiesel samples was performed under specific \n\nconditions: the molar ratio of oil/methanol used was 1:5 with 0.5% sodium hydroxide \n\nby weight of oil as catalyst. The reaction was performed at 55 \u00baC during 24 h under \n\nmethanol reflux. The reaction time chosen was adopted for convenience and to \n\nguarantee a complete reaction conversion of one liter of oil. Raw glycerol was removed \n\nin two steps, the first after 3 h reaction and then after 24 h reaction in a separating \n\nfunnel. Biodiesel was purified by washing with hot distilled water until a neutral pH \n\nwas achieved. The biodiesel was then dried until the EN ISO 12937 limit for water was \n\nreached (less than 500 ppm of water). The water content was checked by Karl- Fischer \n\ntitration. \n\nThere are a lot of publications that report biodiesel productions in shorter times (3-4 \n\nhours of synthesis). But in these conditions biodiesels did not possess a good quality \n\nlevel, as the yield was less than 90%. The presence of intermediate species in biodiesel \n\ninfluences dramatically their thermodynamic properties. Conditions to produce \n\nbiodiesel were optimized until conversion reaction obtained has yields of more than \n\n96.5% (EN14103). Therefore the reaction time was increased to a limit value (24h) to \n\nguarantee a complete conversion at the reaction. \n\nIn fact many author produce and test biodiesel considering the optimization \n\nprocedures developed by other works, as a generic recipe.7 This could be acceptable \n\nwhere the target is to produce biodiesel from different raw materials, but yield needs to \n\nbe always evaluated as esters content, in order to produce reliable data for scientific \n\ncommunity. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n194 \n\n \n\nAfter production the biodiesel fuels were stored under a nitrogen inert atmosphere \n\nuntil analysis of biodiesel quality. \n\n \n\nBiodiesel Characterization. \n\nBiodiesel was characterized following the EN14214:2003 and the results are \n\npresented in Tables 1. Detailed description of biodiesel composition is reported in Table \n\n2, showing qualitative and quantitative information. Figure 1 presents the quantity of \n\nsaturated and unsaturated components of each biodiesel. \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n \n\nAs presented in Table 1 and Figure 1 all biodiesel have different fatty acids profile. \n\nPalm oil has the higher quantity of saturated long chain such as palmitic (C16:0) and \n\nstearic (C18:0) acid. It has three times more saturated compounds then other raw \n\nmaterials studied.

American norm has opened standard limitation for \n\nalmost properties. The studied properties are density, viscosity, iodine value, and CFPP. \n\nAtomization and vaporization of fuel in engines are greatly influenced by the \n\nviscosity and density of the fuel and these properties are temperature and pressure \n\ndependents. The viscosity is defined as the resistance offered by one portion of a \n\nmaterial moving over another portion of the same material.8 The viscosity is required \n\nfor the design of pipes, fittings and equipment to be used in industry of oil and fuel9. A \n\nviscous fuel, causing a poorer atomization, which is the first step of combustion, is \n\nresponsible for premature injector cooking and poor fuel combustion.10 11 The biodiesel \n\nstandard EN 14214 sets the viscosity at 40\u00b0C measured with viscometer Stabinger in a \n\nrange of 3.5 \u2013 5 mm2/s. American limits lies in the range 1.9 - 6 mm2/s. It was shown12-\n\n13 that viscosity decreases with decreasing of the length chain and with the alcohol \n\nlength, and with increasing of unsaturation level. \n\nFigure 2 presents results of kinematic viscosity of all biodiesel samples at 40 \u00baC. In a \n\ngeneral way it\u2019s seen that biodiesel with great content of saturated compounds, as palm, \n\npresents higher viscosity, and soybean with more than 80% of unsaturated compounds \n\npresents the lower viscosity. The viscosity has almost no correlation with percentage of \n\ntotal saturated or total unsaturated compounds (0.50), but presents a high correlation \n\ncoefficient of 0.94 with the percentage of polyunsaturated esters. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n198 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Viscosity of methyl esters of studied biodiesels\n\n \n\nThe density is of special importance for diesel engines because fuel is\n\nengine volumetrically.

It was possible to evaluate \n\nthe influence of unsaturation level in the properties measured and also correlate them.  \n\nStudied properties were density, viscosity, iodine value, and CFPP (and CP). All \n\nproperties related with original raw material composition. No correlation between the \n\ndensity and viscosity was observed, as in another investigation on biodiesel8 but all \n\nbiodiesel compliances the European and American Standard for density and viscosity \n\nproperties. \n\nBiodiesels made from feedstock containing higher concentrations of high-melting \n\npoint saturated long-chain fatty acids tends to have poor cold flow properties. It was \n\nobserved that the biodiesel from palm oil presents problems for cold flow properties \n\nwith specification outside the European limits. Blends of it with other biodiesel fuels \n\ncan improve these properties in order to comply with European specifications. \n\nThe ideal biodiesel fuel profile presents a limited quantity of saturated esters for \n\nimproving his cold behavior. Likewise a small quantity of polyunsaturated esters will \n\nreduce iodine value and increase stability. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n203 \n\n \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n\nMaria Jorge Pratas acknowledges the financial support from Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia \n\ne a Tecnologia through her Ph.D. grant (SFRH/BD/28258/2006).

This \n\nnew experimental data was successfully modelled with the CPA EoS. Using data from \n\nC6 to C10 and the Elliot\u2019s cross-associating combining rule a correlation for the kij binary \n\ninteraction parameter, as a function of the acid chain length, is proposed. The mutual \n\nsolubilities of water and fatty acids can be adequately described with average deviations \n\ninferior to 6 % for the water rich phase and 30 % for the acid rich phase. Furthermore, \n\nsatisfactory predictions of solid-liquid equilibria of seven fatty acids (C12-C18) + water \n\nsystems were achieved based only on the kij correlation obtained from LLE data.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: Biodiesel, CPA EoS, Fatty acids, Mutual solubilities, Water \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n213 \n\n \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nFatty acids are important commodities with an increasing wide range of industrial \n\napplications1. Widespread use can be found in different products, such as: household \n\nand industrial cleaners, coatings and adhesives, paints, personal care products, \n\npharmaceuticals, cosmetics, industrial lubricants, corrosion inhibitors, polymers, \n\ntextiles, foods, paper, crayons, candles and waxes. Particular applications of some \n\nspecific fatty acids can be found elsewhere1. Fatty acids can also be used as raw \n\nmaterials for fatty alcohols and biodiesel production1, 2. \n\nAlthough the chain length limits used to define fatty acids are not strict, these are \n\ntypically higher chain length aliphatic carboxylic acids with 6-24 carbon atoms. \n\nAccording to literature, the worldwide production capacity for fatty acids in 2001 was \n\naround 4 x 106 metric tons1.  \n\nAlthough shorter chain length carboxylic acids are usually produced synthetically, \n\nmost of the fatty acids are obtained from natural oils and fats by hydrolysis (chemical or \n\nenzymatic). Hydrolysis converts the oil or fat (a triglyceride) into three fatty acid \n\nmolecules and glycerol, usually at high temperature and high pressure conditions, using \n\nabout 30-60 % water in a fatty acid weight basis. In some cases, acid washing is \n\nperformed before the hydrolysis reaction in order to remove impurities. Following \n\nhydrolysis, different purification processes can be employed, among them \n\ncrystallization (typically with methanol or acetone), solvent extraction (either liquid-\n\nliquid or supercritical fluid extraction) distillation and adsorption. Distillation removes \n\ncolour and odour bodies3, low boiling unsaponifiable materials, polymerized materials, \n\ntriglycerides and heavy decomposition products. Other separation processes include \n\nhydrophilization, panning and pressing and formation of solid urea complexes1. \n\nAlthough fatty acids may be used for biodiesel production, transesterification is the \n\nmost frequently used4 method for producing biodiesel from vegetable oils, tallow or \n\nwaste cooking oils5. It consists on the reaction of an oil or fat with an alcohol to form \n\nfatty esters with glycerol as a byproduct. A catalyst is necessary to increase reactions \n\nrate and yield and basic catalysts are preferred due to higher reaction rates and lower \n\nprocess temperatures6. Methanol and ethanol can be used as alcohols in the reaction, but \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n214 \n\n \n\nmethanol is preferred due to its low cost and physical and chemical advantages in the \n\nprocess4, 7. \n\nIn the biodiesel production process the fatty esters rich current coming from the \n\nreactor is saturated with glycerol, alcohol, catalyst and unreacted soaps. This current is \n\nwashed in a liquid-liquid extractor in counter current with acidified water to neutralize \n\nthe catalyst and to convert soaps to free fatty acids. The raffinate current is composed of \n\nwater saturated biodiesel while the extract is a low pH aqueous solution containing the \n\npolar compounds8. The design and optimization of the purification of biodiesel with \n\nwater requires a model that can describe this phase equilibria.  \n\nIn spite of the importance of the phase equilibria of fatty acid + water systems, there \n\nis a lack of experimental data for their mutual solubilities. To overcome this limitation, \n\nmeasurements were carried out for the water solubility in six fatty acids and the \n\ncomplete phase diagrams were established for pentanoic, hexanoic and dodecanoic \n\nacids. \n\nSeveral models have been previously applied to systems containing fatty acids with \n\ndifferent degrees of success. Carboxylic acids can form dimers in the vapour phase as \n\nwell as dimers, trimers or even oligomers in the liquid phase, which make acid mixtures \n\nhighly non-ideal, requiring a model able to take into account these interactions, in order \n\nto correctly describe their phase equilibria. \n\nOne of those approaches is the UNIFAC model. Yet, this model does not perform \n\nwell when dealing with polar compounds with association, such as the water + acid \n\nsystems9-12, because it does not take explicitly into account the association interactions \n\npresent in these systems. Moreover it does not take into account the dimerization in the \n\nvapour phase. Improvements with respect to the original UNIFAC model were achieved \n\nby the addition of an association term so as to take into account the association effects. \n\nThe A-UNIFAC model was satisfactorily applied to predict vapor\u2013liquid and liquid\u2013\n\nliquid equilibria and to compute infinite dilution activity coefficients for mixtures \n\ncontaining alcohols, carboxylic acids, water, esters, aromatic hydrocarbons and \n\nalkanes13. Applying the A-UNIFAC model to associating systems is quite demanding \n\nsince it is necessary to analyze every UNIFAC functional group in order to recognize \n\nthe presence of associating sites. \n\nAnother thermodynamic model proposed for acid systems is the group contribution \n\nequation of state, GC-EoS developed by Skjold-J\u00f8rgensen14 that was extended by Gros \n\n\n\n \n\n215 \n\n \n\net al.15 to mixtures of fatty oils and their derivatives (fatty acids, fatty acid esters, mono- \n\nand di-glycerides) with supercritical solvents like carbon dioxide or propane. The \n\nassociation model proposed by Gros et al. provided results in better agreement with the \n\nexperimental data than the GC-EoS. \n\nThe coupling of a cubic equation of state (SRK) with a model that expresses the \n\ndimerization of the acid molecules was also used to correlate experimental VLE for \n\ngases in acetic acid16, 17. \n\nThe Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) model was used to compute phase \n\nequilibria of formic, acetic and propanoic acid binary systems with aromatic \n\nhydrocarbons18. The same approach was followed by Fu and Sandler19 and its results \n\ncompared to those of the simplified SAFT EoS. These two models were also used, in \n\nthe same work, to correlate cross-associating systems containing acids, alcohols and \n\nwater. The original SAFT model performed better than the simplified one, but none of \n\nthem was able to produce a good description of aqueous systems. \n\nThe Cubic plus Association (CPA) EoS was used to correlate VLE and LLE for short \n\nchain acids + aliphatic hydrocarbons, in agreement with the experimental data20. The \n\nextension of the application of this model to binary aqueous mixtures was only made up \n\nto acetic acid systems, with satisfactory results21.  \n\nAs a result of our ongoing effort to develop an equation of state model for the \n\ndescription of the phase equilibria, relevant for the biodiesel production, in a previous \n\nwork, the CPA EoS was shown to be an accurate model to describe the water solubility \n\nin fatty acid esters and commercial biodiesels22.  \n\nIn this subsequent study, which scope is also of interest for the biodiesel industry, the \n\nCPA EoS is applied for the first time to carboxylic acids heavier than propanoic acid \n\n(up to C20 for pure component properties and up to C18 for mixtures), and to the \n\ndescription of LLE and SLE of their binary mixtures with water.  \n\nIn the mentioned preceding paper, the CPA EoS was applied to mixtures of fatty acid \n\nesters (non-self-associating compounds) and water, while in this paper mixtures of acids \n\n(self-associating compounds) and water are studied. Systems with carboxylic acids are \n\nusually strongly non-ideal and considerably more difficult to model than ester mixtures. \n\nTwo different associating combining rules are here evaluated on the basis of their \n\nability to correlate these water + fatty acid systems. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n216 \n\n \n\nIt will be shown that short chain and long chain carboxylic acids have different \n\nbehaviour requiring different cross-associating combining rules and that the dissociation \n\nof the acids smaller than pentanoic acid will have a major impact on their mutual \n\nsolubilities with water. To correlate the mutual solubilities of water and carboxylic acids \n\nstudied in this work, only binary interaction parameters (kij) in the physical part of CPA \n\nwere used, and these were found to be linearly dependent on the acid chain length.  \n\nUsing this dependency for the interaction parameters, SLE predictions for seven fatty \n\nacids in water will also be presented in this work.  \n\n \n\nExperimental Section \n\n \n\nWater solubility measurements were carried in: pentanoic acid (SIGMA, ? 99 %), \n\nhexanoic acid (SIGMA, ? 99.5 %), heptanoic acid (FLUKA, ? 99 %), octanoic acid \n\n(SIGMA, ? 99 %), nonanoic acid (SIGMA, ? 99.5 %) and decanoic acid (SIGMA, ? 98 \n\n%), at temperatures from 288.15 to 323.15 K and at atmospheric pressure. The \n\nmethodology used in this work, has previously been successfully used for other organic \n\ncompounds at our laboratory22-25. The acid and the water phases were initially agitated \n\nvigorously and allowed to reach equilibrium by separation of both phases in 20 mL \n\nglass vials for at least 48 h. This period proved to be the time required to guarantee a \n\ncomplete separation of the two phases and that no further variations in mole fraction \n\nsolubilities occurred. \n\nThe temperature was maintained by keeping the glass vials containing the phases in \n\nequilibrium inside an aluminium block specially designed for this purpose, which is \n\nplaced in an isolated air bath capable of maintaining the temperature within (\u00b1 0.01 K). \n\nThe temperature control was achieved with a PID temperature controller driven by a \n\ncalibrated Pt100 (class 1/10) temperature sensor inserted in the aluminium block. In \n\norder to reach temperatures below room temperature, a Julabo circulator, model F25-\n\nHD, was coupled to the overall oven system allowing the passage of a thermostatized \n\nfluid flux around the aluminium block. The solubility of water in the acid rich phase \n\nwas determined using a Metrohm 831 Karl Fischer (KF) coulometer. \n\n\n\n \n\n217 \n\n \n\nThe acid rich phase was sampled at each temperature from the equilibrium vials using \n\nglass syringes kept dry and at the same temperature of the measurements. Samples of \n\n0.1 to 0.2 g were injected directly into the KF coulometric titrator. \n\nFor pentanoic, hexanoic and dodecanoic (SIGMA, ? 99 %) acids, measurements of \n\nthe phase envelope for the two phase region were made by turbidimetry. Several \n\nsamples covering the entire concentration range were prepared. The mixture was heated \n\ninside a closed glass tube in a thermostatic bath up to the one phase region. On slowly \n\ncooling, the phase separation temperature was registered. The temperature assigned to \n\nthe phase envelope is an average of five measurements. \n\nFor heavier acids, melting temperatures are significantly higher, what therefore \n\nprevents the measurements of solubilities in a temperature range adequate to the \n\nexperimental techniques used in this work. \n\n \n\nModel \n\nThe CPA equation of state can be described as the sum of two contributions: one \n\naccounting for physical interactions, that in the current work is taken as the SRK EoS, \n\nand another accounting for association, the Wertheim association term26, 27. \n\n \n\n? ? ???\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n?+?\n\n?+\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n=+=\ni A\n\niAi\n.assoc.phys\n\ni\n\n)X(x\ngln\n\n)b(RT\n\na\n\nb\nZZZ 11\n\n2\n\n1\n\n11\n\n1\n       (1) \n\nwhere a is the energy parameter, b the co-volume parameter, ? is the density, g a \n\nsimplified hard-sphere radial distribution function, XAi the mole fraction of pure \n\ncomponent i not bonded at site A and xi is the mole fraction of component i. \n\nThe pure component energy parameter of CPA has a Soave-type temperature \n\ndependency: \n\n \n\n( )[ ] 210 11 rTca)T(a ?+=                   (2) \nwhere a0 and c1 are regressed from pure component vapour pressure and liquid density \n\ndata. \n\nXAi is related to the association strength ?AiBj between sites belonging to two different \n\nmolecules and is calculated by solving the following set of equations: \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n218 \n\n \n\n \n\n? ? ?+\n=\n\nj B\n\nBA\nBjj\n\nAi\n\nj\n\njiXx\nX\n\n?1\n1\n\n               (3) \n\nwhere \n\n( ) ji\nji\n\nji BA\nij\n\nBA\nBA\n\nb\nRT\n\ng ?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n=? 1exp             (4) \n\nwhere ?AiBj and ?AiBj are the association energy and the association volume, respectively. \n\n \n\nThe simplified radial distribution function, g(?) is given by : \n\n( )\n??\n\n=?\n9.11\n\n1\ng    where    ?=? b\n\n4\n\n1\n       (5) \n\n \n\nFor non-associating components, such as n-alkanes, CPA has three pure component \n\nparameters (a0, c1 and b) while for associating components like organic acids it has five \n\n(a0, c1, b, ?, ?).

Only these combining rules have been \n\nfound to be successful in previous applications27, 31. CR-2 provided very good results in \n\nthe modelling of the VLE of glycol + water systems31, the LLE and VLE of water + \n\nheavy alcohol systems30 and the LLE of the water + amine systems32; on the other hand, \n\nthe CR-4 approach performed better in predicting the VLE and SLE of water + small \n\nalcohols systems30, the VLE of small acids + water or small acids + alcohol systems20, \n\nthe VLE of amine + alcohol32 systems and the SLE of the MEG + water systems33. In \n\nthis work, the CR-2 and the CR-4 were evaluated on the basis of their ability to describe \n\nLLE and SLE of water and fatty acids binary mixtures. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n220 \n\n \n\n \n\nFor the estimation of the kij parameter the objective function employed was: \n\n? ??\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n? ?\n=\n\nNP\n\ni i\n\ni\ncalc\ni\n\nx\n\nxx\nOF\n\n2\n\n.exp\n\n.exp.\n\n           (13) \n\nwhere single phase or both phase data can be selected for the parameter optimization. \n\nThe association term depends on the number and type of association sites. For water a \n\nfour-site (4C) association scheme was adopted34, and for acids the carboxylic group is \n\ntreated as a single association site (1A). \n\nCarboxylic acids can form dimers in the vapor phase as well as dimers, trimers or \n\neven oligomers in the liquid phase. Several previous works with the CPA EoS or with \n\nsome variants of the SAFT EoS had already discussed the best association scheme for \n\norganic acids16-20. Several association schemes were evaluated for both the gas and \n\nliquid phases (1A, 2B and 4C). It was showed that when using the CPA EoS, the 1A \n\nscheme performs globally better than the two-site (2B) model (VLE, LLE, second virial \n\ncoefficients and equilibrium constants20). Huang and Radosz using SAFT18 also used \n\nthe one site model for carboxylic acids such as formic, acetic and n-propanoic. The \n\nsame associating scheme for carboxylic acids (1A) can also be found in the paper of Fu \n\nand Sandler19. Therefore this association scheme was adopted in this work.  \n\n \n\nResults and discussion \n\n \n\nExperimental Results \n\n \n\nThe data for the water solubility in 6 fatty acids, in the temperature range 288.15 - \n\n323.15 K, are listed in Table 1 as well as their respective standard deviations.

The reasonability of the application of DIPPR \n\ncorrelations in a broad temperature range is questionable when actual experimental data \n\nis missing, and extrapolation was required in some cases, as can be seen in Table 3, \n\nwhere the reduced temperature ranges for which experimental data for vapor pressures \n\nand liquid densities are available from DIPPR are presented for the organic acids \n\nstudied. The results reported in Table 4, show that it is possible with CPA to achieve an \n\nexcellent description of the experimental (correlated) vapour pressure and liquid \n\ndensities for all the studied acids, with global average deviations of about 2 % for both \n\nproperties. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n224 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3.

Although the solubility of these acids \n\nin water was available in the literature38 between 298.15 \u2013 373.15 K, little information \n\nwas found for the water solubility on the acids35 prompting the measurement of these \n\ndata in this work.  \n\n \n\nCorrelation of the mutual solubilities \n\nTo obtain a good description of the mutual solubilities of water and fatty acids the \n\nfitting of the binary interaction parameter kij of Eq. 7 is required. Data from both the \n\norganic and aqueous phases were used for the binary interaction parameter optimization. \n\nValues for the binary interaction parameters obtained using both combining rules under \n\nstudy are presented at Table 5. \n\n \n\nTable 5.

For the heavier acids the trends of the kij values with the \n\ncarbon number are also close to a linear tendency, as seen in Figure 2. The kij values for \n\nthe smaller acids are somewhat off the linear tendency, particularly for pentanoic acid. \n\nNevertheless, in order to increase the predictive character of the model, linear \n\ncorrelations of the kij with the chain length of the acid, Cn, for the two combining rules \n\nevaluated, were proposed, and described by equations (14) and (15) for CR-2 and CR-4, \n\nrespectively, in order to allow the applicability of the model for heavier acids when \n\nequilibria data are not available. The extrapolation of the linear correlation will further \n\nbe shown to be successful for the description of fatty acids + water systems from C12 to \n\nC18.  \n\n \n\n 0070.00140.0 +\u00d7?= nij Ck        (14) \n\n 0020.00142.0 +\u00d7?= nij Ck         (15) \n\n \n\nFigure 2. kij trend with the acid carbon number (?, CR-2; ?, CR-4) and linear \n\ncorrelations (?, CR-2; \u2026., CR-4 ). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n228 \n\n \n\nResults on the water rich phase are more dependent on the binary interaction \n\nparameter than the acid rich phase. Small variations in the kij\u2019s values result in \n\nsignificant deviations in the description of the water rich phase with almost no impact in \n\nthe acid rich phase. In fact, and for both association combining rules, the values for the \n\nkij\u2019s optimized using both phases follow the same dependency as the kij\u2019s evaluated \n\nsolely from the water rich phase. The results obtained indicate that it is possible to \n\npredict the behaviour of the acid rich phase from the binary interaction parameters \n\noptimized using only data from the water rich phase. \n\nThe estimated kij\u2019s are small, indicating that the CPA EoS is able to take adequately \n\ninto account the cross-association interactions that occur in water + fatty acid systems, \n\nwith any of the combining rules studied. \n\nAs shown in Figure 2, for the pentanoic acid + water system, the kij value was \n\nconsiderably off the linear tendency observed for the other compounds, indicating that \n\ndifferent interactions may be present on this system. This deviation of the pentanoic \n\nacid from the behaviour of the other acids may be due to a higher degree of dissociation \n\nof the pentanoic acid in water, that the CPA EoS does not take into account. This may \n\nalso be related to the unexpected behaviour of butanoic acid. From the analysis of the \n\nmutual solubilities of the higher acids, the phase envelopes of pentanoic and hexanoic \n\nacids, and the CPA predictions using the kij correlations, it would be expected that \n\nbutanoic acid would only be partially miscible with water at room temperature. Yet, full \n\nmiscibility of butanoic acid and water is observed under these conditions. The enhanced \n\nsolubility of the lower acids in water results from new favourable interactions between \n\nthe two compounds, not fully represented by the approached used in this work. \n\n \n\nEvaluation of the Combining rule \n\nThe two combining rules studied produce very different descriptions of the acid rich \n\nphase but have no impact on the water rich phase, showing very similar global average \n\ndeviations. \n\n \n\nAs shown in Table 5 the CR-2 combining rule produces better results for smaller \n\nacids up to C7. An increase in global average deviations with the chain length of the \n\nacid is observed for the heavier compounds of the homologous series. \n\n\n\n \n\n229 \n\n \n\nThe opposite behaviour was observed for the CR-4 rule, producing very good results \n\nfor the heavier acids. The CR-4 combining rule performs globally better than the CR-2 \n\nwith the advantage of increasing the calculation speed. With this combining rule, the \n\nwater solubility in acids is described with a global average deviation below 30 %. The \n\nacid solubility in water is estimated with a global average deviation below 6 %, as \n\nreported in Table 5.

The proposed model and the linear \n\ncorrelation for the binary interaction parameters can be used as a predictive tool to the \n\ndescription of systems of interest in industrial processes were organic and aqueous \n\nphases are present. For instance, for the oleic acid + water system, for which LLE data \n\nat higher temperatures and pressures were available in the literature40. The CR-4 \n\ncombining rule and the kij predicted through the linear correlation were used. As seen in \n\nFigure 3 very good results were obtained for the water solubility with a global average \n\ndeviation inferior to 6 %. The same prediction was made for the dodecanoic acid + \n\nwater system with global average deviations inferior to 22 % for the water solubility. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n231 \n\n \n\n \n\nPrediction of the solubility of solid fatty acids in water \n\nSaturated fatty acids above decanoic acid are solid at room temperature and their \n\nsolubilities in water are solid \u2013 liquid equilibria. \n\nThe CPA EoS has been previously applied to the description of the SLE of alcohol \u2013 \n\nalkanes, glycol \u2013 water and alcohol \u2013 water26 mixtures, but never to the SLE of fatty \n\nacids and water systems. The purpose here is to investigate the predictive performance \n\nof the CPA EoS with the interaction parameter correlations obtained from LLE data and \n\nfor each combining rule selected. \n\nEquations to describe the SLE for binary systems are well established in the \n\nliterature41.  \n\nConsidering the formation of a pure solid phase and neglecting the effect of pressure, \n\nthe solubility of a solute s can be calculated from the following generalized expression \n\nthat relates the reference state fugacities: \n\n \n\n            ?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n??\n?\n\n??\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n= 1ln\n\n11\n\n),(\n\n),(\nln\n\n, T\n\nT\n\nT\n\nT\n\nR\n\nC\n\nTTR\n\nH\n\nPTf\n\nPTf mmp\n\nsm\n\nsfus\n\nsol\ns\n\nliq\ns              (16) \n\nwhere Hfus?  is the enthalpy of fusion, T is the absolute temperature, Tm is the melting \n\ntemperature, pC?  is the difference of the liquid and solid molar heat capacities and R \n\nthe gas constant. \n\nThe heat capacity contribution can be neglected with respect to the enthalpic term, as \n\nalready observed for fatty acid systems in the work from Costa et al42 where the high \n\npressure solid-liquid equilibria of fatty acids was studied. Complete immiscibility in the \n\nsolid phase and absence of a solid\u2013complex phase were also assumed. \n\nThe following expression for the solubility is considered,  \n\n \n\n \n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?=\n\nsm\n\nsfus\n\nL\ns\n\nL\ns\n\ns\nTTR\n\nH\nx\n\n,\n\n0 11\nexp\n\n?\n?\n\n         (17) \n\nwhere ?  is the fugacity coefficient and subscript 0 refer to pure component. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n232 \n\n \n\nFew experimental SLE data are available in the literature and only for 7 fatty acids \n\n(from C12 to C18)\n38, 40. \n\nThe values for the thermophysical properties needed to perform SLE calculations, \n\nmelting temperature (Tm) and heat of fusion ( Hfus? ), found in literature for the pure \n\ncompounds (from C12 to C18)\n36 are presented at Table 6.  \n\nThese properties increase with the organic acid carbon number and a parity effect can \n\nbe observed due to differences in the molecular packing of these compounds in the solid \n\nstate.  \n\nThe CR-2 combining rule performed better than CR-4 with global average deviations \n\nof 51 % and 63 %, respectively, as seen in Table 6 and Figure 5. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 6.

The measured data are in good agreement with previously available \n\nmeasurements. \n\nThe CPA EoS was here extended to long chain carboxylic acids and their binary \n\naqueous mixtures. Two different combining rules were tested. \n\nA single, small, temperature independent and chain length dependent binary \n\ninteraction parameter was enough to describe the mutual solubilities. A correlation for \n\nthe binary interaction parameters was proposed. \n\nFor small acids, from C5 to C7, the CR-2 combining rule produced somewhat better \n\nresults for the mutual solubilities, while the Elliot combining rule (CR-4) performed \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n234 \n\n \n\nbetter for the heavier fatty acids up to C10. Using the CPA EoS and the CR-4 combining \n\nrule, global average deviations lower than 30 % were obtained for the water solubility \n\nand than 6% for the acid solubility.  \n\nThe kij correlation was successfully extrapolated to model the LLE of the oleic acid + \n\nwater and dodecanoic + water systems and to predict, SLE of binary aqueous mixtures \n\nwith fatty acids from C12 to C18, supporting the use of a linear correlation with the acid \n\ncarbon number for the binary interaction parameters. \n\nThe good results obtained for the different types of equilibria of water + fatty acid \n\nmixtures and for the mutual solubilities of water + ester binary systems encourage the \n\napplication of the CPA EoS for the design of extraction units for fatty acid and biodiesel \n\nproduction. \n\n \n\nNotation \n\na = energy parameter in the physical term \n\na0, c1 = parameters for calculating a \n\nAi = site A in molecule i \n\nb = co-volume \n\nCp = heat capacity \n\ng = simplified hard-sphere radial distribution function  \n\nH = enthalpy \n\nkij = binary interaction parameter \n\nP = vapor pressure \n\nR = gas constant \n\ns = solubility \n\nT = temperature \n\nx = mole fraction \n\nXAi = fraction of molecule i not bonded at site A \n\nZ = compressibility factor \n\n \n\nGreek Symbols \n\n? = association volume \n\n? = association energy \n\n\n\n \n\n235 \n\n \n\n? = reduced fluid density \n\n? = mole density \n\n? = association strength  \n\n? = variation  \n\n? = vapour \n\n? = activity coefficient \n\n?  = the fugacity coefficient \n\n \n\nSubscripts \n\nc = critical \n\nfus = fusion \n\ni,j = pure component indexes \n\nliq. = liquid \n\nm = melting \n\nr = reduced \n\n \n\nSuperscripts \n\nassoc. = association \n\nphys. = physical \n\n \n\nList of Abbreviations \n\nAAD = average absolute deviation \n\nCPA = cubic-plus-association  \n\nCR = combining rule \n\nEoS = equation of state \n\nLLE = liquid - liquid equilibria \n\nVLE = vapor - liquid equilibria \n\nSLE = solid - liquid equilibria \n\nSAFT = statistical associating fluid theory \n\nSRK = Soave-Redlich-Kwong  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n236 \n\n \n\nLiterature Cited \n\n1.

Introduction \n\n \n\nThe large number of recent research works addressing the production, \n\ncharacterization and use of biodiesel clearly demonstrate the increasing worldwide \n\nimportance of this biofuel. Offering the various advantages known to characterize \n\nbiofuels, sustainability, reduction of greenhouse gases emissions, regional development \n\nand secure supply  [1], biodiesel is actually the most promising alternative for \n\npetroleum based fuels for compressed ignition (diesel) engines. Due to its similarity in \n\nchemical structure and energy content with conventional diesel, it can be used in \n\nexisting engines as pure or blended with regular diesel [2]. In fact, biodiesel, a blend of \n\nfatty acid alkyl esters, along with bioethanol, already represents 1.6% of the transport \n\nfuel used worldwide [3]. \n\nAlthough most research activities have been addressing different methods to \n\nproduce biodiesel, involving new feedstock (such as cooking waste oil and microalgae \n\noils  [4]), novel catalysts (heterogeneous catalyst and enzymes)  [4] and process \n\nconditions (supercritical [4]), the actual industrial way to produce biodiesel consists on \n\nthe transesterification reaction of a vegetable oil with an alcohol (usually methanol [5] \n\nor ethanol in countries where this alcohol is easily produced and available [6]) with a \n\nbasic catalyst, using mild operation conditions. The produced fatty acid esters cannot be \n\nlabeled as biodiesel until they meet the EN 14214 [7] quality specifications in Europe \n\n,and the ASTM D6751 in the USA. As a consequence, after the transesterification \n\nreaction, the fatty acid methyl esters undergo several purification processes in order not \n\nto overcome the minimum contents in free glycerol, soap, metals, alcohol, free fatty \n\nacids, catalyst, water and glyceride established by the European and American \n\nstandards. A high presence of these compounds in the biodiesel strongly affects the fuel \n\nproperties and performance and consequently the engine life. \n\nOne of these purification steps is the fatty acid esters washing with hot water. This \n\nis the most common method of purification as it is efficient in removing methanol \n\nglycerol, sodium compounds, free fatty acid esters and soaps [8]. \n\nHowever, one of the requirements of the European and American quality standards \n\nis the biodiesel water content, since water affects the calorific value of the biodiesel, can \n\ncause the esters to react to produce soaps and can cause blocking and wearing of the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n244 \n\n \n\nengine injection system. Water in biodiesel also diminishes the shelf life of the fuel, \n\nsince it decreases the biodiesel oxidation stability and promotes biological growth [[9, \n\n10]]. Consequently, after being washed with water, the fatty acid esters are dried in \n\norder to produce biodiesel with a water content not overcoming the maximum value of \n\n0.05% (w/w) imposed in Europe by the EN 14214. \n\nIn the last few years, our research group has been addressing the measurement of \n\nphase equilibria and the development of thermodynamic models for the description of \n\nbiodiesel production and purification processes [11-17]. Being able to predict the \n\ndifferent phase equilibria of the binary and multicomponent systems found during the \n\nbiodiesel production and purification, in a wide range of thermodynamic conditions, is \n\nessential for a correct design and optimization of these industrial processes, through the \n\ncorrect selection of suitable solvents, the most advantageous unit operations and \n\nseparation sequence and their optimal size and operating conditions. \n\nTwo of these studies were focused on the measurement and prediction of the water \n\nsolubility in pure fatty acid alkyl esters and biodiesels [15, 17]. Knowing the water \n\nsolubility in biodiesels is essential for the biodiesel production and purification \n\nprocesses, allowing tuning the more favorable raw materials and correctly designing and \n\noptimizing the biodiesel washing and drying units in order to produce high quality \n\nbiodiesel in agreement with the European and American quality specifications.  \n\nWhile assessing the poor performance of commonly used thermodynamic models, \n\nnamely cubic equations of state and activity coefficient models, to describe the water \n\nsolubility in fatty acid esters and their mixtures [15] , the authors also developed and \n\napplied a more theoretical sound model, the Cubic-Plus-Association equation of state \n\n(CPA EoS), that explicitly describes the specific interactions between like molecules (in \n\nthis case water) and unlike molecules (cross-association, in this case between esters and \n\nwater). In an accurate, predictive and simple way, this model proved to be the most \n\nappropriate to describe the water solubility in biodiesels [15, 17]. \n\nFollowing these studies, in this work, new experimental water solubility \n\nmeasurements were carried out for methyl linoleate and four biodiesels synthetized at \n\nour laboratory from edible oils commonly used for producing biodiesel [4]: rapeseed, \n\nsoybean, palm and sunflower, and the CPA EoS was applied to predict these new \n\nexperimental data.  \n\n\n\n \n\n245 \n\n \n\nAs the CPA EoS prediction of the water solubility in biodiesels is performed using \n\ninteraction parameters obtained from binary phase equilibria data, it was possible, using \n\nthe new data for methyl linoleate, to evaluate the contribution of this binary system to \n\nthe improvement of the model prediction capability for the water solubility in \n\nbiodiesels, by reassessing the results presented before for the water solubility in six \n\ncommercial biodiesels [17]. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. Experimental Section \n\n \n\nMaterials  \n\nThe water solubility was measured in the biodiesels synthesized by the \n\ntransesterification reaction with methanol of the vegetable oils: soybean, rapeseed, palm \n\nand sunflower. The molar ratio of oil/methanol used was 1:5 using 0.5% sodium \n\nhydroxide by weight of oil as a catalyst. The reaction was performed at 55 \u00baC during 24 \n\nh under methanol reflux. The reaction time chosen was adopted for convenience and to \n\nguarantee a complete reaction conversion. Raw glycerol was removed in two steps, the \n\nfirst after 3h reaction and then after 24h reaction in a separating funnel. Biodiesel was \n\npurified through washing with hot distillated water until a neutral pH was achieved. The \n\nbiodiesel was then dried until the EN ISO 14214 limit for water was reached [7]. \n\nBiodiesels were characterized by GC-FID following the British Standard \n\nEN14103 from EN 14214 [7] to know their methyl esters composition. Capillary gas \n\nchromatography was used to determine the methyl ester composition of the biodiesel \n\nsamples. A Varian CP-3800 with a flame ionization detector in a split injection system \n\nwith a Select\u2122 Biodiesel for FAME Column, (30 m x 0.32 mm x 0.25 \u00b5m), was used to \n\ndifferentiate all methyl esters in analysis inclusively the poli-unsaturated ones. The \n\ncolumn temperature was set at 120\u00baC and then programmed to increase up to 250 \u00baC, at \n\n4 \u00baC/min. Detector and injector were set at 250 \u00baC. The carrier gas was helium with a \n\nflow rate of 2 mL/min. \n\nThe water solubility was also measured in methyl linoleate (Aldrich, 99%). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n246 \n\n \n\nExperimental Procedure  \n\nThe water solubility measurements were carried out at temperatures from 288.15 to \n\n318.15 K and at atmospheric pressure. The methodology used in this work, has already \n\nbeen successfully used for measuring the water solubility in fatty acid esters, biodiesels \n\n[17] and fatty acids [12]. The ester and the water phases were initially agitated \n\nvigorously and allowed to reach the saturation equilibrium by the separation of both \n\nphases in 20 mL glass vials for at least 48 h. This period proved to be the minimum time \n\nrequired to guarantee a complete separation of the two phases and that no further \n\nvariations in mole fraction solubilities occurred. \n\nThe temperature was maintained by keeping the glass vials containing the phases \n\nin equilibrium inside an aluminium block specially designed for this purpose, which is \n\nplaced in an isolated air bath capable of maintaining the temperature within (\u00b10.01 K). \n\nThe temperature control was achieved with a PID temperature controller driven by \n\na calibrated Pt100 (class 1/10) temperature sensor inserted in the aluminium block. In \n\norder to reach temperatures below room temperature, a Julabo circulator, model F25-\n\nHD, was coupled to the overall oven system allowing the passage of a thermostatized \n\nfluid flux around the aluminium block. The solubility of water in the ester rich phase \n\nwas determined using a Metrohm 831 Karl Fischer (KF) coulometer. \n\nThe esters rich phase was sampled at each temperature from the equilibrium vials \n\nusing glass syringes maintained dry and at the same temperature of the measurements. \n\nSamples of 0.1 to 0.2 g were taken and injected directly into the KF coulometric titrator. \n\nThe water solubility results at each individual temperature are an average of at \n\nleast five independent measurements. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.

As expected, since \n\nthe water solubility in fatty acid esters increases with the ester insaturation [17], palm \n\nbiodiesel presents the lowest water solubility, in agreement with its higher content in the \n\nsaturated ester methyl palmitate. The other biodiesels present quite similar water \n\n\n\n \n\n249 \n\n \n\nsolubility values, as expected due to their analogous fatty acid ester composition, with \n\nthe sunflower biodiesel presenting the highest water solubility. \n\n \n\nAs explained at the introduction section, we have previously applied the CPA EoS \n\nto describe the water solubility in fatty acid esters and to predict it in biodiesels [17]. \n\nThe information gathered in that work will be applied here, as subsequently shown, to \n\npredict the experimental results. \n\n \n\nModeling with the CPA EoS starts with the definition of the CPA pure compounds \n\nparameters. Esters are non-self-associating compounds and consequently there are only \n\nthree pure compound parameters from the physical term to be determined: a0, c1 and b. \n\nThese parameters are usually determined from a simultaneous regression of vapour \n\npressure and liquid density data. In a previous work [17] these parameters were \n\nestimated for the methyl esters C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2, which are the major components \n\nof commercial biodiesels . Due to the lack of reliable liquid density data for the \n\nunsaturated esters at the time, preference was given to the vapour pressure description. \n\n \n\nRecently, using density data for several fatty acid esters and biodiesels [21, 22], \n\nmeasured by us, it was possible to re-estimate the CPA pure compound parameters for \n\nall the fatty acid methyl esters found in the biodiesel samples considered in this work, \n\ncompounds ranging from 15 to 25 carbon atoms and with up to three unsaturated bonds \n\n(Table 3), by a simultaneous regression of pure component data. Vapor pressures and \n\nliquid densities were described with global average deviations inferior to 2 % (Table 3). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n250 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3.

The kij\u2019s for ester/ester \n\nwere set to zero and, as already stated above, the solvation phenomena between the non-\n\nself-associating ester and the self-associating water was considered as a cross-\n\nassociation within the framework of the CPA EoS, where the cross-association energy \n\n\n\n \n\n251 \n\n \n\n(?ij) was considered to be half the value of the association energy for the self-associating \n\ncomponent (in this case water) and the cross-association volume (?ij) was left as an \n\nadjustable parameter, fitted to the equilibrium data along with the kij. \n\nWhen describing the water solubility in different fatty acid esters [17], a constant \n\nvalue for the cross-association volume, ?ij, was established (of 0.201), as well as a linear \n\ncorrelation for calculating the kij\u2019s between esters and water was found with the chain \n\nlength of the ester, Cn: \n\n \n\nkij=0.0136 Cn \u2013 0.3322                       (1) \n\n \n\nThis correlation, and the constant value for the cross-association volume, allowed \n\npredicting the water solubility in six commercial biodiesels from GALP, with global \n\naverage deviations inferior to 15% [17]. Only for the kij between water and methyl \n\noleate it was used the regressed value from phase equilibria data since it did not fit in \n\nthe linear dependency with the carbon number determined for the saturated methyl \n\nesters. In addition, as phase equilibria data for the water/methyl linoleate system wasn\u00b4t \n\navailable at that time, the kij value for this sub-binary system was made equal to the one \n\nestablished for the water/methyl oleate system. \n\nIn this work, having measured the water solubility in methyl linoleate, the \n\ncorresponding kij interaction parameter was determined, using the same constant value \n\nfor the cross-association volume referred before. A kij value of -0.13 was obtained, \n\ndescribing the water solubility with global average deviations inferior to 3% (Table 4 \n\nand Figure 1). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n252 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.Water solubility in methyl linoleate: symbols experimental results and solid \n\nline CPA EoS results (kij = \n\n \n\nThe experimental water solubility in the \n\nbiodiesels were then predicted using the recently assessed CPA pure compound \n\nparameters for esters and the previously proposed linear correlation to estimate the \n\ninteraction parameters between the different saturated fatty acid methyl esters \n\nconstituting the biodiesels and water, with global average deviations inferior to 7 % for \n\nthese four biodiesels.

The deodorization is carried not just in edible oils \n\nbut also in some cases before alkaline catalysis in biodiesel production. Enzymatic \n\ncatalysis is here studied as an alternative to convert this by-product into biodiesel. \n\nAs the oleic acid is one of the main components recovered in the deodorization step it \n\nwas used in this work as model. The optimal esterification conditions of oleic acid with \n\nmethanol and ethanol were evaluated by their influence in reaction yield. An \n\nexperimental design 22 was followed to study the influence of the dependent variables \n\nin percentage of conversion, namely the alcohol / oleic acid molar ratio (R) and enzyme \n\nconcentration (E). \n\nThe optimal conditions obtained were R=6.3 and E=6.6% for methanol (100% \n\nconversion), and R=4.9 and E=5.7% for ethanol (95.5% of conversion). \n\nThe influence of temperature on the reaction was also studied, in a range between 30 \n\nand 60 \u00b0C for methanol, and between 30 and 70 \u00b0C for ethanol; with a molar ratio of 6 \n\nand an enzyme concentration of 2%. It was found that the conversion increases \n\nmonotonously with increasing temperature for ethanol. For methanol, the conversion \n\nhas a maximum at 50 \u00ba C and then decreases. \n\nAnother investigated variable was the pressure in the methanol esterification reaction, \n\nat constant temperature of 40\u00baC, in the same conditions as temperature study, and was \n\nobserved that the yield increases 38% just with 90 bar of nitrogen in the vessel.  \n\nThe same enzyme was shown to the reusable up to 10 times in the esterification of \n\noleic acid with ethanol, without significant loss of enzyme activity. \n\n \n\nKEYWORDS: Enzymatic Catalyze, Esterification, Biodiesel, Oleic Acid, Novozyme \n\n435. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n267 \n\n \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nThe energy used nowadays comes mostly from fossil fuels like coal, natural gas or \n\noil. The fact that the reserves of fossil fuels are finite and the environmental problems \n\nassociated with their use need a change in mindset and the use of alternative forms of \n\nenergy production.1,2 \n\nIn these scenario vegetable oils, become more attractive, because of their renewable \n\nnature and environmental benefits. However, vegetable oils have some disadvantages to \n\nbe used as a combustible.3,4 First of all, the direct use in internal combustion engines is \n\nproblematic. Due to their high viscosity (about 5\u201310 times greater than diesel fuel) 5 and \n\nlow volatility, they do not burn completely and form deposits in the fuel injectors of \n\ndiesel engine.6 An improvement on viscosity can be obtained with transesterification, \n\nwhich seems to be the process that assures best results in terms of lowering viscosity \n\nand improving other characteristics.7-8 \n\nThe final product of a transesterifcation reaction of vegetal oil, with an alcohol in a \n\npresence of a catalyst, is a mixture of alkyl esters that is known as biodiesel. It is highly \n\nbiodegradable in fresh water as well as in soil.9 Furthermore, the use of biodiesel in \n\ndiesel engines reduces the emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, particulate \n\nmatter and sulphur dioxide.5,10,11. Biodiesel is said to be carbon neutral, it means that \n\nCO2 produced from their combustion is being put back into the atmosphere, as recently \n\nhas been removed from there by photosynthesis during the growth of the feedstock \n\ncrops. \n\nThe transesterification process, used in biodiesel production, can be carried out in \n\ndifferent ways such as alkali, acid or bio-catalysis. Of all these methods, the alkali \n\nprocess is the most used in industrial scale but it presents problems of separation of \n\ncatalyst and unreacted methanol from biodiesel.4,12 Biocatalysis eliminates these \n\ndisadvantages producing biodiesel with a very high purity. Nevertheless enzyme \n\ncatalyzed process offers several additional benefits:13 \n\n-compatibility with variations in quality of the raw the raw materials, \n\n-few process steps, \n\n-higher quality glycerol, \n\n-improved phase separation (no emulsification from soaps) \n\n-reduce energy consumption and wastewater volumes. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n268 \n\n \n\n \n\nHowever, the enzymatic process has not been implemented in an industrial scale due \n\nto enzymes high cost, lipase low activity or enzyme inhibition by methanol.14,15 \n\nThe raw material costs and limited availability of raw vegetable oil are being recently \n\ncritical issues for the biodiesel production.16 Therefore, it has been necessary to look for \n\nanother raw material to produce biodiesel. Acid oils or raw materials with high levels of \n\navailable free fatty acids could be an alternative. In these cases the alkaline catalysis has \n\nserious limitations, and the enzymatic production of biodiesel is a good alternative. \n\nIn this work the performance of lipase Novozym\u00ae 435 was tested as a biocatalyst in \n\nthe enzymatic esterification reaction of oleic acid with an alcohol, to produce biodiesel \n\nin a solvent-free system, shown in Figure 1. It was also tested the effect of reactions \n\nfactors, as enzyme quantity and alcohol / oil molar ratio. Another studied variable was \n\npressure of an inert gas in the vessel reaction. \n\n \n\nH33C17\n\nOH\n\nO\n\nROH+ + H2O\n\noleic acid alcohol alkyl ester\n(Biodiesel)\n\nwater\n\nH33C17\n\nOR\n\nO\n\nR=CH3 ou CH2CH3\ncatalyst\n\nFigure 1 - Esterification reaction of oleic acid with an alcohol. \n\n \n\nThe process of biodiesel production was optimized by application of the experimental \n\ndesign and Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Using a factorial planning with \n\nthree levels, the influence of temperature, enzyme/oil ratio and methanol/oil ratio was \n\nstudied, as well as their interaction. After being verified that the temperature had no \n\nstatistical significance, on the studied range, a new design factorial 22 was defined. In \n\norder to improve the response surface another design was defined on the region with \n\nhigher conversions, central composite 22. The tested variables were methanol/oleic acid \n\nmolar ratio and enzyme concentration. \n\nThe reaction effects were studied to indicate the best stoichiometry conditions to \n\nperform the esterification reaction with Novozym 435. The temperature was studied \n\nlater on a larger range of values under fixed conditions of alcohol/oleic acid molar ratio \n\nand enzyme concentration. To study the reuse of the immobilized enzymes was carried \n\nout a set of ten consecutive tests of three hours for each alcohol. In order to evaluate \n\n\n\n \n\n269 \n\n \n\npressure influence on esterification reaction, variable pressures of an inert gas were \n\nadded in the beginning of the reaction, and then evaluated its effect on the yield. \n\n \n\n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\nMaterials. Novozym 435, a commercial Lipase B from Candida antartiac, \n\nimmobilized on macroporous acrylic resin was used as a catalyst in the esterification \n\nreaction of oleic acid. It was a kind gift of Novozymes to perform this work. \n\nOleic acid (90.0% m/m) was supplied by Aldrich. Methanol and Ethanol (99.9% \n\nm/m) was purchased from Lab-scan, and all other chemicals used were obtained \n\ncommercially and were of analytical grade. \n\n \n\nEsterification process. The enzymatic esterification reactions were carried out in a \n\nclosed vase containing oleic acid, the enzyme and alcohol. All reagents and catalyst \n\nwere weighted in a five digits balance. The reaction was carried out in an orbital stirrer \n\nwith controlled temperature and stirring. After the reaction two samples were collected \n\nfrom the bottom of the final product. Finally the samples were dried passing through \n\nanhydrous sodium sulfate. Variables that could affect the yield, like total volume of \n\nvase, and total volume of reagents, were maintained constant in each experiment. \n\nThe work was performed in several steps, a previous study was made to define \n\nreaction time in order to keep it constant though all experiments, then the influence in \n\nthe yield of reaction factors, and at last temperature and pressure effects were studied. \n\n \n\nSample derivatization. Before gas chromatography analysis, samples were silylated \n\nas follows17: approximately 30 \u00b5L of each dried sample was dissolved in 100 \u00b5L of \n\npyridine. At this point compounds containing carboxyl groups were converted into TMS \n\nesters, by adding 100 \u00b5L of bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoro-acetamide (BSTFA) and 50 \u00b5L \n\nof trimethylchlorosilane, and keeping at 70\u00b0C for 30 min. Then the derivatized samples \n\nwere analyzed by gas chromatography. \n\n \n\nAnalysis of methyl esters. The methyl ester contents were quantified using a \n\ncapillary gas chromatography. Each sylilated sample was injected into a gas \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n270 \n\n \n\nchromatographer with a flame ionization detector (Varian 3800 GC-FID) in a split \n\ninjection system with the ratio of 1:20. On analysis a DB1-ht column (length: 15 m, \n\ninternal diameter: 0.32 mm and film thickness: 0.1 \u00b5m) coated with 0.1 \u00b5m film of \n\ndimethylpolysiloxane was used. The column temperature was set at 100 \u00baC and then \n\nprogrammed to increase up to 200 \u00baC, at 8 \u00baC/min with a final landing of 5 min holding \n\nthe temperature. Detector and injector temperatures were set at 220 \u00baC and 250 \u00baC, \n\nrespectively. The carrier gas was Helium with a flow rate of 2 mL/min. \n\n \n\nYield quantification. The percentage of conversion (alkyl esters formed) on the \n\nreaction was quantified by comparison between the areas from the peaks of alkyl esters \n\nand oleic acid on the chromatogram according to Equation 1 , where Aae is the area of \n\nthe peak of alkyl ester and Aoa is the area of the peak of oleic acid. \n\njklmnopqkl =\nrsn\n\nrsn + rks\n\u00d7 uvv (1) \n\n \n\nSoftware.

Esterification \n\nreaction of oleic acid with methanol was followed during 24 hours (Figure 212). The \n\nalcohol/oleic acid molar ratio was 6 and the enzyme concentration was 2%. The \n\nagitation used was 150 rpm with a temperature of 40 \u00baC. All variables were selected \n\nbased on available literature. 13  -  21 This reaction was repeated using ethanol, with similar \n\nresults. \n\nTo evaluate the influence of variable in the yield three hours of reaction time was \n\nchosen and was used in all experiments. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 212: Logarithmic trend line for the \n\nred) ethanol.

Based \n\non these results it was possible to create a second order mathematical model for studied \n\nparameters and their interaction, represented on equation 5. \n\nThe equation generated by the second order mathematical model for the experimental \n\ndesigns of two variables for esterification with ethanol is \n\nwxy%z = ?4.613 + 12.50Y + 23.87? ? 1.354Y? + 0.2381Y? ? 2.166??

The enzyme concentration is the most significant variable. \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 7 : Pareto chart for experimental designs of 2 variables of esterification with \n\nethanol. \n\n \n\nThe correlation of the model is 0.760, which can be considered acceptable \n\nconsidering that we are working with biological catalysts.

It is \n\npossible to verify that the area with higher conversion (>80%) lies between a molar \n\nratio of 3 and 7 and an enzyme concentration between 4 and 7%. These graphs indicate \n\nthat the conversion increases with increasing ethanol/oleic acid molar ratio up to about 5 \n\nand there is a decrease on the conversion for higher molar ratio values. The increase in \n\nenzyme concentration has a positive effect in response up to values of about 6%, and \n\nfrom that value, the conversion decreases.  \n\nThe maximum value of the Equation 5 was about 93.4%, which corresponded to the \n\nconditions of a molar ratio of 4.87 and an enzyme concentration of 5.65%. The result \n\nobtained experimentally for these conditions was 95.5%, a value close to expected, \n\nconfirming the suitability of the model. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n281 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8 : Response surface for experimental designs of 2 variables of esterification \n\nwith ethanol. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9 : Contour plot for experimental designs of 2 variables of esterification with \n\nethanol. \n\n  \n\nE \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n282 \n\n \n\n \n\nStudy of the Temperature influence on the reaction \n\n \n\nThe influence of the temperature on the reaction was presented in Figure 10. As can \n\nbe seen, the conversion increases monotonously with increasing temperature when \n\nethanol is used for the range of values studied. For methanol the conversion increases \n\nup to approximately 50 \u00baC and decreases with increasing temperature for higher \n\ntemperatures. This behavior can be explained by the fact that methanol is more adverse \n\nto the enzyme than ethanol. So, for higher temperatures, the enzyme is deactivated by \n\nmethanol leading to lower conversions. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10: Influence of the temperature on the reaction using (\u2014) methanol or  \n\n(\u2014) ethanol.

Here were studied 15 methyl \n\nesters which 6 are unsaturated compounds (with 2 polyunsaturated) and 10 ethyl esters \n\nwhich 3 are unsaturated, as well as 8 different biodiesel samples, fatty acid methyl \n\nesters, produced in our laboratory.  \n\nAn extensive critical review of the data available for these systems was carried out \n\nto identify spurious or poor quality data among the often conflicting data previously \n\nfound in the literature. For biodiesel fuels the lack of information about its composition \n\nlimited the utility of most data available in the open literature. \n\nThe performance of predictive models for these properties was evaluated. GC-VOL \n\nmodel was tested for density as its group contribution methods, it can predict the \n\nproperty directly from their structure. GC-VOL model shows to be able to predict \n\ndensity of pure methyl and ethyl esters with deviations lower than 1% for saturated \n\nesters and 2% for unsaturated. In order to improve predictive ability of GC-VOL model \n\nto this type of compounds, new coefficients were proposed. Thus deviations of density \n\nof pure esters were reduced to 0.25% and for biodiesel to 0.37%. \n\nGroup contribution models were evaluated in prediction of pure esters viscosity. \n\nCeriani &amp; Meirelles model provide a fair description of viscosity of fatty acid esters \n\nwith a global average deviation of 8.8% while Marrero &amp; Gani model presents an \n\naverage deviation of 20.9% for overall pure esters. \n\nSeveral models were tested in biodiesel viscosity evaluation. Yuan, Ceriani &amp; \n\nMeirelles and Krisnangkura models present average deviation of 5.34%, 8.07% and \n\n7.25%, respectively. A revised Yuan\u2019s model was proposed which provides the best \n\ndescription of experimental data with an average deviation of 4.65%. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n292 \n\n \n\nDensity at pressures up to 45 MPa was also measured for 3 pure methyl esters and 8 \n\nbiodiesels fuels. High pressure experimental data were successfully predicted with the \n\nCPA EoS, with a maximum deviation of 2.5%. \n\nTo understand the biodiesel cold flow performances data on the phase equilibria of \n\nbiodiesel below the CP were measured. The UNIQUAC predictive model is shown to \n\nbe capable of providing an adequate representation of the phase equilibria for these \n\nsystems below their cloud point. \n\nA large number of properties depend on the esters profile of biodiesel, such as \n\ndensity, viscosity, iodine index, and CFPP. The objective of this study is to evaluate the \n\nproperties of biodiesel oils obtained from different raw materials. Biodiesels made from \n\nfeedstock containing higher concentrations of high-melting point saturated long-chain \n\nfatty acids tends to have poor cold flow properties. Biodiesel made from raw material \n\nwith higher concentrations of unsaturated long-chain fatty acids presents low resistance \n\nto oxidation as expressed by a high iodine value. \n\nWater solubility data on biodiesels were measured and modelled. The good results \n\nobtained for water + fatty acid mixtures, for the mutual solubilities of water + ester \n\nbinary system, and for the solubility of water in biodiesel encourage the application of \n\nthe CPA EoS for the design of extraction units for fatty acid an biodiesel production. \n\nIn second section the study of enzymatic esterification of oleic acid catalyzed by \n\nNovozym 435 was presented. Different results were obtained for reaction with methanol \n\nor with ethanol. For the first alcohol, less quantity of enzyme and also less excess of \n\nalcohol are necessary to achieve 100% yield. Esterification reaction is benefited being \n\ncarried out under pressure, obtained a yield 38% higher with just 90 bar. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n293 \n\n \n\nIdeas to the future \n \n\nIn consequence of environmental, economical and also political turmoil, caused by \n\nthe excessive use and dependency of conventional petroleum based fuels the attention of \n\nseveral countries has been addressed towards the development of alternative fuels from \n\nrenewable resources.1,2 \n\nThe world has got so accustomed to using petrofuels that we never realized that they \n\ncame with an expiry date. Who can imagine a world without planes, cars and trains? \n\nMany scientists have started researching alternatives to the fuels that we use. These \n\nalternatives need to be lasting and renewable in nature. Initial attempts at replacing fuels \n\nwith electricity to run cars have proved successful. However, the performance of these \n\ncars does not match that of the conventional petrol or diesel-run engines. So it becomes \n\nnecessary to replace existing fuels and biodiesel appears as an alternative. \n\nAfter examining the pros and cons of biofuels, we may be left wondering if they are \n\nreally worthwhile and right for us. On one hand biofuels could potentially reduce \n\ncarbon emissions and can help save cash too; but on the other hand biofuels can \n\nnegatively affect the habitat of many species and aren\u2019t necessarily energy efficient at \n\nthe production stage.  \n\nWith the increase in global human population, more land may be needed to produce \n\nfood for human consumption (indirectly via animal feed). The problem already exists in \n\nAsia. Vegetal oil prices are relatively higher there. The same trend will eventually \n\nhappen in the rest of the world. This is the potential challenge to biodiesel. From this \n\npoint of view, biodiesel can be used most effectively as a supplement to other energy \n\nforms, not as a primary source. Biodiesel is particularly useful in mining and marine \n\nsituations where lower pollution levels are important. \n\nPerhaps the biggest hope for biofuels is that the arrival of second and third generation \n\nalternatives should lead to more efficient production and diversify the plants as well as \n\nplant wastes used \u2013 therefore limiting the effects to any particular habitat. Biofuels are \n\nvery much a work in progress. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n294 \n\n \n\nThe studies on biofuels are important but even if fossil diesel will not be completely \n\nsubstitute by biofuels, it can reduce our dependence from those kind of non renewable \n\nsource of energy. \n\nEven though future discoveries and inventions in renewable energy might be \n\nsurprising, it is nonetheless important for us to start learning how to consume energy \n\nmore sensibly. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n295 \n\n \n\nBibliography \n \n1.
