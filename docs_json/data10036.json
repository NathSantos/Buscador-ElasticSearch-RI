the core of \n\nEU?s strategy for the next decades. An 80% reduction on GHG emissions by 2050 requires \nMember States and energy sectors to adopt measures that help to achieve this long-term \nobjective through intermediate 2020 binding targets. \n\nTransport appears as the most resilient sector on this transition period, as it is highly \ndependent of one single and imported fossil energy source. Despite the achieved efficiency in \n\nmodern vehicles, increasing patterns on private car usage urges the need to diversify its energy \nmix while reducing its environmental impact.  \nThe development of a prediction tool, which can evaluate the energy and CO2 well- to-wheel \n\nimpact due to the uptake of technical and non-technical measures, constitutes a key element to \nsupport decision makers on finding the best future energy scenario.  \n\n \nThe research work and the obtained results were conducted and internally presented a t Toyota \nMotor Europe, during an internship period between the 15\n\nt h\n March 2010 and 11\n\nt h\n March 2011. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n2 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nSummary \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  3 \n\n \n\nSummary \n \n\nWhat is the problem? \nThe need to d iversify transport?s energy matrix requires decision makers both at the political \nand industrial level to define future strategies and priorities for the transport sector. Hence, the \n\nneed to have representative data of the current European transport situation is crucial to project \nfuture scenarios allowing finding a best energy-technology compromise.  \n \n\n \nWhy there is a problem? \n\n1. Lack of detailed European data \n2. Lack of modelling across all transport modes (air, rail, road and sea) and sub-modes \n\n(airplanes, metro, high-speed, bus, car, etc) \n\n3. The need to test elasticity \n \n\nEurostat \n\nRepresentative energy data for the transport sector can be found at the Eurostat?s database \nhowever its scope is still limited. Understanding of the well-to-wheel contribution of the \n\nrailways, bus or passenger car urges the need to study the transport system across all modes.  \nAdditionally, it is not possible to individually characterize each well- to-wheel energy and CO2 \n\nefficiencies for each sub-mode such as metro, high-speed, bus, car and others, in terms of \nenergy/km, energy/pkm, CO2/km and CO2/pkm.  \n \n\nTremove, Ex-Tremis \n\nModels such as the Tremove or the Ex-Tremis provide interesting tank-to-wheel data for the \n\nroad and rail sub- modes but they do not match the totals provided by the Eurostat. Also, it is \nnot possible to individually characterize all transport sub- modes, their energy and \nenvironmental efficiencies, as well as the interaction across all transport sub-modes. \n\n \n \n\nWhat was realized? \nA comprehensive transport model considering all the major transport means, its associated \nenergy efficiencies, all related to the passenger mobility demand published by the Eurostat  \n\nwas developed. A well- to-wheel analysis is performed matching with the tank-to-wheel \nquantities provided by the Eurostat. Figure 1 shows the dissertation work sequence.  \n\n \nFigure 1 \u2013 [Summar y] Dissertation fl ow. \n\n \n\n1.\n\nTransport energy \nand CO2 model\n\n2.\n\nAnalyzed external \ndata sources\n\n3.\n\nFuture energy and \nCO2 scenarios\n\n\n\nSummary \n\n \n\n4 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nSeveral data sources were analyzed, in particular the \u201cJEC Biofuel Programme\u201d and the  \n\nNational Renewable Energy Action Plans from each Member State, with the objective of \nprojecting a future likely situation. This allowed projecting an expected energy efficiency \n\nimprovement, the calculation of potential biofuel blends that might be in the market by 2020, \nas well as a potential market size for electric vehicles.  \n \n\nUsing the developed model together with the expected 2020 energy situation, several \nscenarios evaluating the well-to-wheel energy and CO2 impacts resulting from the uptake of \n\ntechnical and non-technical measures were performed.  \n \n \n\nWhat was concluded? \nResponsible for about 50% of the total well- to-wheel energy consumption and CO2 emissions \n\nof the transport sector, the car segment presents the largest potential to reduce transport?s oil \nreliance. On a business as usual scenario for 2020, the passenger mobility?s tank-to-wheel \nCO2 emissions are projected to increase about 23% to the level of 906MtCO2, above 2007 \n\nlevels. \n \n\nCurrent capacity of the collective modes s uch as metro, normal-, high-speed and bus cannot \nabsorb all the mobility demand currently performed by the car segment. The single full modal-\nshift from the passenger car into those modes offers the potential of reducing in about 15% the \n\nwell-to-wheel CO2 emissions, in the reference year. \n \n\nThe current low capacity of the high-speed segment to absorb passengers from the aviation \nand car segments, offers a marginal 6% and 3% well- to-wheel CO2 reduction in case of a full \nshift of longer journeys, in the refere nce year. \n\n \nIn a scenario of efficiency improvements, the passenger car is alone capable to reduce by 17% \n\nthe well-to-wheel CO2 emissions of the passenger mobility segment. An additional 5% \nreduction is possible if other modes such as aviation, bus and passenger vans also improve.  \n \n\nThe single uptake of the biofuel blend calculated on the NREAPs (11% volume bioethanol, \n12% volume biodiesel), offers the potential to reduce the we ll- to-wheel CO2 emissions by 3%, \n\nin the reference year.  \n \nA full uptake of electric vehicles in urban areas offers the potential to reduce the passenger \n\nmobility?s well- to-wheel CO2 emissions by 31%, being the largest measure to reduce \nemissions. A real uptake of electric vehicles such as the one coming from the NREAPs, offers \n\na potential of 5% well-to-wheel CO2 reductions.  \n \n \n\nIn which extent the model was useful? \nThe developed transport model, together with the results from the N REAPs, helped Toyota \n\nMotor Europe to evaluate different energy scenarios and to support future business decisio ns. \n\n\n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 1 \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  7 \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n \n\n1.1. The European energy context \n \nEnlargement, market liberalization and economy growth contributed for the continuously \n\nincrease of EU?s energy consumption since early 1990s, while the phase out of old power \nplants, improvements on energy efficiency, the uptake of renewable energy sources together \nwith the recent economic recession contributed for the decrease of CO2 emissions [1], as \n\nshown in Figure 2. \nRecent political crisis in Middle East and Northern Africa raised concerns about EU?s security \n\nof energy supply, creating uncertainties on the markets and energy prices. Ensuring energy \nsecurity while reducing its imports dependency and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, are \nthe main driving forces of the European Union policies for the decades to come.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2 \u2013 [Intro] EU\u2019s energy and CO2 e vol ution [1, 2]. \n\n \n \n\nThe 2020 vision \n\nIn March 2007, the European Union endorsed an integrated approach called \u201cThe European \n\nClimate C hange Package\u201d aiming to reduce GHG emissions and increase the penetration level \nof renewable energy sources. Transform the EU into a highly energy-efficient and low-carbon \neconomy was the motivation of this energy policy package. To start this process, EU Heads of \n\nState and Governments set a series of climate and energy targets to be met by 2020, as shown \nin Figure 3. These are [3]: \n\n- 20% reduction on GHG emissions below 1990 levels; \n- 20% share of renewable energy sources on final energy consumption, with a \n\nmandatory objective of 10% for the transport sector; \n\n- 20% reduction in primary energy consumption compared with projected levels, to be \nachieved by energy efficiency. \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n8 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3 \u2013 [Intro] Org anigram of EU\u2019s Cli mate Change P ackage. \n\n \n\n \n\nMajor European climate mechanisms \n\nLaunched in 2005, the European Emiss ions Trading System (EU ETS) is a pioneer mechanism \n\nto reduce industrial GHG emissions. The system is based on a \u201ccap and trade\u201d principle, \nwhich means that there is a limit on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be \n\nemitted by the industry players registered in the system. Within this cap, high carbon intense \ncompanies receive emission allowances which they can sell to or buy from one another as \nneeded [4]. \n\nThe Transport, Household and Agriculture sectors are excluded from the Emissions Trading \nScheme, belonging to the non-ETS sector. This means that their GHG emissions cannot be \n\ntraded creating the need to implement individual mechanisms and measures.  \n \nOn the transport sector, the inclusion of the aviation sector in the EU ETS by 2012 represents \n\none of the main mechanisms to virtually reduce its carbon emissions. This will allow air  \ncompanies to buy and sell emissions allowances according to their level of carbon emissions \n\n[5]. \nFor the road transport sector, indicative emissions targets for new cars and vans sales, the \ncarbon-indexed taxation for passenger cars and the road taxation for heavy duty trucks are \n\nsome of the mechanisms now in place to reduce road carbon emissions [6]. \nIt is that expected by 2020 the average new sales emissions for car OEMs should achieve a \n\nmaximum of 95gCO2/km, and for new van sales this figure is slightly higher, 135gCO2/km \n[6]. The objective of road taxation is to input a price per km driven for heavy duty trucks in \ncountries where this traffic is considerable high.  \n\n20% CO2 reduction \n\nvs 1990\n\n20% RES in final \nconsumption\n\n10% RES in tra nsport\n\nCompanies (ETS)\n\nEnergy &amp; Industrial\n\n21% CO2 reduction vs 2005\n\nCountries (non-ETS)\n\nAgriculture, Household, \nTransport\n\n10% GHG reduction vs 2005\n\n20% increase in \nenergy efficiency\n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  9 \n\n \n\nThe recently published White Paper for the future of transport outlined a 60% long-term CO2 \n\nreduction target to be met by 2050 [7]. \n \n\nRegarding fuels, the directive 2003/30/EC required fuel suppliers to incorporate a n average \nrenewable energy source blending of 2% by 2005 and 5,75% by 2010. This should have been \nachieved through blends of bioethanol and biodiesel on gasoline and diesel, without any \n\nrequirement specific for each biofuels type [8]. \nAlso, according to the fuel quality directive (2009/30/EC), there is a mandatory objective that \n\nintends to reduce the carbon intensity of the supplied fuels for transport. It is required that by \n2020, average fuels supplied for road transport should be 6% less carbon intense compared to \n2010, in a well- to-wheel basis. It includes all fossil fuels, gasoline, diesel, LPG and Natural \n\nGas as well as bio fuels and electricity for road [9]. \n \n\n \n\nThe National Renewable Energy Action Plans \n\nThe European Commission required each Member State to provide information on how they \n\nplan to meet their 2020 final renewable energy objectives, underlined in the renewable energy \ndirective (2009/28/EC). Heating and Cooling, Electricity and Transport, are the three energy-\n\nintense sectors where the European Commission wants to have a detailed picture for the years \nup to 2020. Data on energy consumption and renewable energy integration should be \npublished in these reports, as well as policies and measures needed to drive national energy \n\nmarkets in those objectives. It was required from each Member State to respect the template \nprovided by the European Commission where all energy data should be detailed by energy \n\ntype, technology and year-by-year from 2010 up to 2020 [10]. \n \n \n\n1.2. The European transport sector \n \n\nThe Transport sector is a crucial sector for EU?s economy. It ensures territorial cohesion, \nincreases the EU?s competitiveness, brings together people and cities, and allows the transport \nof goods through all Member States. \n\n \n \n\nA major energy consumer \n\nTransport accounts for about 30% of EU?s final e nergy consumption with an high dependence \non one single and imported fossil energy source: oil [11] as shown in Figure 4. O il?s high \n\nenergy density represents a crucial advantage in all mobility solutions and an essential \nrequirement for those that are more sensitive to weight and autonomy, such as aviation and \n\nlong-distance road transport. Also, its distribution and refuelling installed infrastructure \ntogether with its relative cheap price compared to others energy carriers, places it in a \ndominant and stable market position.  \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n10 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4 \u2013 [Intro] EU\u2019s final energy distributi on, 2007 [11]. \n\n \n \n\nThe aviation sector continues relying almost entirely on kerosene with a light use of gasoline. \nThe uptake of biofuels as well as other renewable energy carriers is negligible. \n\nThe rail sector is the most energy diversified sector of all transport modes. Electricity \nproduced from a variety of primary energy sources such as coal, nuclear and natural gas, and \ndiesel in some applications are the main energy carriers currently used in railways. Also, the \n\ndeployment of the renewable electricity sector makes the rail sector one of the most low-\ncarbon transport modes.  \n\n \nRoad transport relies almost entirely on fossil fue ls such as gasoline and diesel, 96% [11], \ncontributing for its high level of carbon emissions as shown in Figure 5. LPG was the first \n\nalternative energy truly implemented at road transport level with a dedicated refuelling \ninfrastructure however its usage remains marginal when compared to gasoline and diesel. In \n\nrecent years, and especially in countries such as Italy and Sweden, natural gas in forms of \ncompressed natural gas became popular, highly motivated by Government incentives. The \nuptake of biofuels was still marginal in 2007, when energy blends of bioethanol and biodiesel \n\nin gasoline and diesel reached about 1% and 3% [11], respectively. \n\n \nFigure 5 \u2013 [Intro] EU\u2019s road energy distri bution, 2007 [11]. \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  11 \n\n \n\nA major carbon emitter \n\nThe transport sector is responsible for around a quarter of EU?s CO2 emissions being the \nsecond largest emitting sector, after energy. Road transport is the largest emitting mode, \n\naccounting for 70% of transport?s carbon emissions [11]. \nWhile emissions from other sectors have generally falling, those from transport have \ncontinuously increased since the 1990s, reaching its highest level in 2007. Recently data of \n\n2008 and 2009 showed for the first time a significant reduction in transport?s carbon emissions \nin two consecutive years [1]. \n\nSome explanations for this phenomenon are described in the literature: improvements on \nenergy efficiency from new vehicles, the uptake of biofuels and the recent economic recession \nwhich had reduced freight transport activity mainly performed by diesel trucks [1, 7]. \n\n \n \n\nAn intense activity sector \n\nTransport activity is largely determined by people?s location, life style patterns and \navailability of infrastructure. It is used both for people?s mobility and freight transport, for \n\nleisure and work purposes, within EU and at international level.  \n \n\nThe aviation sector presented the largest activity growth during the last decade, showing an \nincrease of 25%, in passenger-km figures, between 2000 and 2007 [11]. Liberalization of air \ntransport increased competition, lowered air fares and widened the range of choices for intra-\n\nEU routes. However, this increase had put some strain on the available capacity \u2013 both in the \nsky and on the ground. Traffic density resulted in an increasing number of delays, saturation \n\nof the sky and shortages in airports capacity.  \n \nRail transport has been reducing its relevance on passenger mobility and freight transport,  \n\nremaining with a constant volume of carried passengers and freight [11]. Recently in 2008, \nEU?s passenger mobility by rail grew about 3,5% compared to 2007, mainly driven by a \n\nremarkable 10% increase on passenger mobility by high-speed rail [11]. The construction of \nnew high-speed lines in countries such as Germany, Spain and The Netherlands, together with \nthe liberalization of their railway market operators have significantly contributed for this \n\nincrease. \n \n\nRoad transport is the most important transport mode in the EU accounting for more than 80% \nand 45% of EU?s passenger mobility and freight transport [11]. Passenger cars and heavy duty \ntrucks appear as the most used sub- modes for these purposes. Despite a slow increase in \n\ninfrastructures in recent years, the road transport?s popularity contributed for the continuous \nincreasing in its activity, resulting in large levels of congestion, noise and air pollution.  \n\nRecently data of 2008 showed a slight decrease on road?s passenger mobility and freight \ntransport [11]. The uptake of high-speed lines might have contributed for a reduction on \npassenger car usage while the recent economic recession might justify the decrease on road \n\nfreight transport activity. \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n12 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nThe Automotive sector \n\nThe European car fleet accounts with about 220million vehicles, with about 4 million being \nadded each year [12]. This figure intends to increase, especially in newer Member States \n\n(EU12) where motorization rates are lower compared to older Member States (EU15). \nDespite the fuel efficiency achieved in modern vehicles, the car sector plays a major role in \ntransport?s energy consumption, in forms of gasoline and diesel, and consequently on carbon \n\nemissions. Large and increasing number of vehicles, together with the increasing activity \nvolumes, seems to have rapidly offset all efficiency gains.  However, in terms of fuel \n\nefficiency improvement of new car sales, the car industry was able to reduce its average new \nsales emissions of about 15% between 2000 and 2009, from 172gCO2/km to 146gCO2/km \n[13], as shown in Figure 6. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6 \u2013 [Intro] Evolution of average ne w c ar sales emissions  [13]. \n\n \n \n\nUrban areas and the modal shift \n\nHigh concentration of population and economic activities in urban areas contributes for the \n\ncontinuous increase on the number of daily journeys, mainly performed by private car and \ndelivery vans. Comfort, privacy and a \u201cdoor-to-door\u201d service, might explain why these modes \nare the most preferred in urban areas, in depreciation of the public and collective modes such \n\nas bus and metro. Here, clearly exists the potential for urban areas improvement, tackling \nactual challenges such as congestion, noise and air quality. \n\nThe uptake and the development of a pan-European high-speed rail network provides a better \nenvironmental solution to replace carbon- intense passenger journeys between city centres, \nallowing also the expansion of freight trains using the remaining normal-speed lines, reducing \n\nroad heavy duty transport.  \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  13 \n\n \n\n1.3. Motivation \n \nUnder the environmental strategies of the European Commission such as the European \n\nClimate C hange Package (ECCP) and the recently published White Paper for the future of \ntransport, there are three principal objectives that are conducting the EU?s energy policy \ndirection for the decades to come. These are: \n\n1) 20% reduction by 2020 below 1990 levels (ECCP) \n2) 10% reduction by 2020 below 2005 levels (non-ETS) \n\n3) 60% reduction by 2050 below 1990 levels (White Paper) \n \nUnder this umbrella it is necessary for decision makers both at the political and industrial level \n\nto project future scenarios enabling the evaluation of the well-to-wheel energy and CO2 \nimpacts resulting from a technical or a non-technical shift. \n\n \nIdentify the potential well- to-wheel energy and CO2 impacts resulting from the uptake of \nmeasures such as the energy efficiency improvements, bio fuels or electric vehicles, as well as \n\nresulting from a modal-shift into collective transport modes requires the characterization of the \ntransport sector in all of its components.  \n\nHence, evaluating the well- to-wheel energy and CO2 efficiency, linking with the actual \npassenger mobility and freight transport demand and also taking into account the current \nEuropean fleet, requires the usage of actual and representative European data for the entire \n\ntransport sector.  \n \n\nThe Eurostat provides official statistics for the European transport sector but is not enough \ndetailed in all the components of the transport system. For example, it is not possible to  \nindividually characterize the total well-to-wheel energy and CO2 situation for the metro, high-\n\nspeed, bus or passenger car, etc, or to characterize its well-to-wheel energy and CO2 \nefficiency per km or per pkm, or even the passenger mobility running in different energy types.  \n\n \nTherefore, a comprehensive transport model that enables the characterization of a ll transport \nmodes and sub- modes, its energy and CO2 performances, all used energy carriers, both for \n\npassenger mobility and freight transport purposes and which can be used as a prediction tool,  \nis a crucial element to support decision makers on finding the best future energy and \n\ntechnological mix.  \n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  15 \n\n \n\n1.4. Objective \n \nThe objectives of this dissertation are: \n\n1) To model the current well- to-wheel energy and CO2 contribution from each mode of \ntransport to the total transport picture,  \n\n2) To analyse the expected future transport energy situation at the European Union level,  \n3) To develop future scenarios taking into account the expected increase on passenger \n\nmobility demand as well as the technical and non-technical shifts. \n\n \nThese objectives were achieved during 3 phases along the internship as shown in Table 1. \n\n \nTable 1 \u2013 [Intr o] Internshi p objecti ves chr onogram. \n\n Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar \n\n2010 Phase 1 Phase 2    \n\n2011           Phase 3 \n\n \n\nPhase 1 \n\nIts objective is to develop a comprehensive and detailed model for the European transport \nsector which evaluates the well-to-wheel energy and CO2 situation through the input of actual \n\nand representative data, such as the one coming from the Eurostat. Then it is required to \nindividually study each mode of transport, each used energy carrier, each associated energy \n\nand CO2 efficiency, linking with the passenger mobility demand data provided by the Eurostat, \nalso in a well- to-wheel basis. \nHaving all categories defined, it will be possible to see the detailed contribution of each mode \n\nof transport for the total well-to-wheel energy and CO2 picture, using real European data from \nthe Eurostat. \n \n\nPhase 2 \n\nIts objective is to analyse each National Renewable Energy Action Plan that all 27 Member \n\nStates have published to the European Commission. A detailed picture of the Electricity and \nTransport energy situation by 2020  will be provided  as well as the calculation of potential \nbiofuel blends that might be in place by 2020 and market size for the electric vehicle segment.  \n\nHaving all data gathered, it will be possible to build detailed electricity and transport expected \nenergy picture by 2020. \n\n \nPhase 3 \n\nIts objective is to develop future energy scenarios based on selected data sources for the year \n\n2020, and on the passenger mobility demand analysis. \nThe manipulation of parameters such as the energy efficiency, the modal shift, vehicle?s \n\npowertrains and energy carriers, will allow building of scenarios and to evaluate the potential \nenergy and CO2 well-to-wheel impacts compared to the reference case.  \nHaving several 2020 scenarios, it will be possible to combine all scenarios and provide a likely \n\nenergy and CO2 situation by 2020.  \n\n\n\n \n\n16 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  17 \n\n \n\n1.5. Dissertation organization and content \n \nThe present dissertation is divided in eight C hapters, with the additional chapters of \n\nReferences and Annexes. \n \nOn the Introduction, the European energy and transport situation are characterized along a \n\ndescription of actual trends and intensities.  \nOn the State of Art, several articles and relevant studies on the transport modelling topic are \n\npresented, together with its important results for the context of this dissertation.  \nOn the Methodology and Model development and calibration, the methodology or the \nconstruction of the transport energy and CO2 model will be explained, followed by the \n\npresentation of the used data sources, and finally the model?s calibration process.  \nOn the Development of 2020 scenarios, the potential energy and CO2 well-to-wheel impacts at \n\nthe passenger mobility level will be evaluated, according to the constructed model and \nexternal data sources. Finally, a likely scenario for 2020 will be presented.  \nFinally, on the chapters of Results, Conclusions and Recommendations for future work , the \n\nfinal results will be presented and discussed as well as the limitations of the adopted \nmethodology and the recommendations of interesting future work on the topic.  \n\n \n \nThis dissertation starts to evaluate the actual contribution of each mode of transport (e.g. \n\nairplanes, metro, bus, car, etc) for the total well-to-wheel energy consumption and CO2 \nemissions, as well as it identifies the individual average well-to-wheel energy efficiency for \n\neach mode, in terms of MJ/km, gCO2/km, MJ/pkm and gCO2/pkm, for each used energy \ncarrier. \nIt also makes the link with the passenger mobility and freight transport variables such as the \n\noccupancy rate, the volume of passenger-km and freight-km transported both by each mode \nand by each energy carrier. \n\n \nThen this dissertation presents the results of the manipulation of the most likely variables that \ncan help the EU to reduce its transport energy consumption and CO2 emissions: energy \n\nefficiency improvements, increase on modal shift, high-speed rail infrastructures, uptake of \nrenewable energies and new power trains. \n\nIt analyzes relevant external data sources such as the \u201cJEC Biofuel Programme\u201d and the \n\u201cNational Renewable Energy Action Plans\u201d, in order to characterize the expected 2020 \ntransport energy situation.  \n\n \nFinally, it assesses the individual and agglomerate  measures and established comparisons with \n\nthe developed reference case, in particular focus for the passenger mobility sector. As a result, \nthis dissertation will provide a likely future transport energy scenario for 2020. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n18 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  19 \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 2 \n\nSTATE OF ART \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n20 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nState of Art \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  21 \n\n \n\n2. State of Art \n \nThis dissertation comprehends a large variety of concepts related to the transport \n\nenvironmental and energy performance. Concepts ranging from energy and CO2 data (total \nquantities), the energy efficiency in terms of energy/km and energy/pkm, passenger mobility \ndata, modal-shift impacts, electric vehicles, all on a well-to-wheel analysis, are some of the \n\nmain examples. However, it does not mean that those concepts will be deeply analyzed in all \nof its fundaments or theoretical definitions.  \n\n \nHere, it is important to inform that the work realized on this dissertation was previously \norganized and idealized by Toyota Motor Europe who provided the principal motivation, the \n\nobjective and the mindset behind this job. The principal tools as well as the calculation method \nwere latterly optimized. \n\n \nThe principal used tools and the articles that were consulted during the learning and model?s \ndevelopment process are presented in the following sections. The articles were selected based \n\non the importance that they had in the moment of model?s calibration as well as adequate \nmethodology findings. Given the differences on the concepts, this chapter is divided in five \n\nsub-chapters: \n1) Transport energy, CO2 and mobility data \n2) The White Paper \n\n3) Technical variables \n4) Non-technical variables \n\n5) Addressing 2020 objectives \n \n \n\n2.1. Transport energy, CO2 and mobility data \n \n\nInformation about the current and future energy, CO2 and passenger mobility situation of the \nEuropean transport system can be found both in the Eurostat and in several European transport \nstudies. \n\n \nThe Eurostat provides current European information on the total transport energy consumption \n\nand CO2 emissions from the four main modes \u2013 air, rail, road and sea. Additionally, the \nEurostat also provides information on passenger mobility and freight transport demand \ndivided by its main sub- modes \u2013 airplanes, metro&amp;tram, railways, high-speed rail, bus, car and \n\npowered-two-wheels. \n \n\nStudies such as the iTREN2030 project [14], and models such as the Tremove [15] and the \nEx-Tremis [16], provide information on the actual and future energy and passenger mobility \ndemand for the European Transport system, by pre senting and evaluating scenarios for the \n\nyears up to 2030. \n \n\n\n\nState of Art \n\n \n\n22 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nRegarding the well- to-wheels energy and CO2 data, the study realized by the JEC consortium \n\n(formed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, the European Car \nAssociation EUCAR, and the European refineries association CONCAWE) represents the \n\nreference information for the well-to-wheel energy and CO2 calculations of the current and \nfuture liquid fossil fuels. \n \n\n \n\nThe Eurostat \n \nThe Eurostat is the statistical office of the European Union which provides to the Community \nthe European statistics, enabling the comparisons betwee n countries and regions. These are \n\nkey informations for decision- makers at EU and Member State level, in business and corporate \norganisations, and on other hand to the public and media for accurate picture of contemporary \n\nsociety and to evaluate the performance of the economy.  \nEach Member State?s national authorities collect their national statistics, verifying and \nanalysing national data and reporting them to the Eurostat. Eurostat?s role is therefore to \n\nconsolidate the data and ensure they are comparable, using harmonized methodology. \nCurrently, the Eurostat is the only provider of statistics at European level.  \n\n \nThe Eurostat energy data \n\nThe energy data provided by the Eurostat presents an o utline tree organization, divided in \n\nthree categories:  \n1) \u201cEnergy quantities\u201d \n\n2) \u201cEnergy prices\u201d  \n3) \u201cEnergy degree-days\u201d \n\n \n\nFor purposes of this dissertation, the \u201cEnergy quantities\u201d tab is the most important as it \nprovides all energy quantities currently in use at the EU. This tab is divided in four categories: \n\n1) \u201cSupply, transformation and consumption\u201d  \n2) \u201cInfrastructures\u201d \n3) \u201cImports\u201d \n\n4) \u201cExports\u201d \n \n\nUnder the \u201cSupply, transformation and consumption\u201d tab, the Eurostat provides data on \u201cFinal \nEnergy Consumption\u201d, which is sub-divided in its main final energy consumption sectors : \n\n1) \u201cIndustry\u201d \n\n2) \u201cHousehold\u201d  \n3) \u201cTransport\u201d \n\n \nFor the Transport sector, the energy data is provided in a detailed picture on final consumption \ndata from its main modes \u2013 air, rail, road and sea. For each mode, it is possible to obtain \n\ndetailed information by energy type \u2013 kerosene, diesel, electricity, gasoline, LPG, natural gas \nand biofuels. Electricity used in the rail sector as well as diesel used in road sector are two \n\nexamples showing the level of detail of the Eurostat energy transport data.  \n\n\n\nState of Art \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  23 \n\n \n\nThe major European transport studies \n \nThe iTREN2030 project \n\n \n\nThe iTREN2030, Integrated Transport and Energy baseline until 2030, is a major study \ndeveloped by the Transport and Mobility of Leuven, Belgium, and the Fraunhofer Institut, \n\nGermany. It is the result of an integrated work gathering several European energy and policy \nmodels such as the Astra, the Poles, the Trans- Tools and the Tremove [14]: \n\n1) The Astra model provides the demographic and economic framework conditions \nfor the EU27 as well as scenario results for transport and energy demand, selected \nitems of vehicle fleets (e.g. new technology vehicles) and of transport demand (e.g. \n\nslow modes) [14]; \n2) The Poles model provides an estimation of energy prices including carbon prices \n\nand changes of fuel taxes as well as energy demand of sectors other than transport \nand the rest of the world [14]; \n\n3) The Trans-Tools model provides the transport demand by mode on a link-based \n\nnetwork level for EU-27 [14]; \n4) The Tremove model calculates vehicle fleets of conventional vehicles with a \n\ndetailed technology classification, transport energy demand and transport \nemissions for EU-27+4 [14]. \n\n \n\nThe iTREN2030 forecasts and assesses the capabilities of the mentioned models to the new \npolicy issues arising from the technology, environment and energy fields. It individually \n\nstudies the national Member States and agglomerates an EU27 picture [14]. \nFor purposes of this dissertation, this study was considered as an important source of \ninformation as it provides values for passenger mobility and energy demand, and associated \n\nCO2 emissions for several sub-modes of transport.  \n \n\n \nThe TREMOVE \n\n \n\nThe Tremove is a major European transport and e nergy model developed by the Transport and \nMobility of Leuven, Belgium, representing one of the most complete and comprehensive \n\ndatabases for fleet composition at European level.  \nIt is also a policy assessment model tha t studies the effects of different transport and \nenvironment policies on the emissions of the transport sector. It estimates the transport \n\ndemand, modal shifts, vehicle stock and the emissions of air pollutants, according to adopted \npolicies for road pricing, public transport pricing, emission standards, subsidies for cleaner \n\ncars, etc. The model covers passenger and freight transport in 31 European countries and \ncovers the period 1995-2030 [15]. \n \n\nThe output of the Tremove model is divided into three categories [15]:  \n1) Demand: it provides information on passenger mobility and freight transport in \n\nfigures of passengers-km and tonnes-km, occupancy rate, fuel type; \n\n\n\nState of Art \n\n \n\n24 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n2) Stock: it provides information on road and rail vehicle stock per country, fuel type \n\nand vehicle technology; \n3) Emissions: it provides information on fuel consumption and pollutant type. \n\n \nWithin its website it is possible to download the spreadsheet files with the data for each \nconsidered 31 countries however an EU27 conglomerated picture is not possible to find.  \n\nFor purposes of this dissertation, this model was considered as an important source of \ninformation as it provides information on rail and road fleet composition by fuel type, \n\nseparated by passenger mobility and freight transport demand.  \n \n \n\nThe EX-TREMIS \n\n \n\nThe Ex-Tremis model is a reference database on fleet and transport activity data, specific \nenergy consumption, emission factors and total emissions for the non-road transport modes, \nsuch as maritime, rail and aviation. It covers all EU27 member states from the year 1980 and \n\nprovides projections for their developments up to 2030 [16]. \nFor purposes of this dissertation, this model was considered as an important source of \n\ninformation as it provides information on rail energy consumption for passenger mobility and \nfreight transport, separated by energy type.  \n \n\n \n\nThe JEC Well-to-Wheels \n \nThe well-to-wheel analysis conducted by the JEC consortium focus on the estimation of \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy consumption and industrial costs of all automotive \n\nfuels and power trains options, for the European car fleet in the period 2010-2020 [17].  \nThe study is an integrated research work evolving periodic updates and incorporating potential \n\nrefining and other process improvements reported by the relevant  stakeholders (e.g. car OEMs, \nrefineries, industry, etc) as well as energy and industrial policy regulators [17]. \nIt should be clarified that in the case of the JEC  Well-to-Wheel report and for purposes of this \n\ndissertation, the well- to-wheel approach differs from a life-cycle analysis, as it does not \nconsider neither the energy consumption nor the GHG emissions involved in the construction \n\nof the facilities, manufacturing vehicles or end of life aspects. Therefore, the JEC Well-to-\nWheel only considers the steps as [17]: \n\n1) Fuel production (well-to-tank) \n\n2) Vehicle use (tank-to-wheel) \n \n\nScope and methodology \n\nThe well-to-tank evaluation accounts for the energy expended and the associated GHG emitted \nin the steps required to deliver the finished fuel into the on-board tank of a vehicle. It covers \n\nall steps from extracting, capturing, producing, manufacturing and transporting the fuel into \nthe pump station [17]. \n\n\n\nState of Art \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  25 \n\n \n\nOn the JEC Well-to-Wheels study, the well- to-tank analysis does not consider the energy or \n\nthe GHG emissions associated with construction or decommissioning of plants and vehicles. \nThe non-consideration is explained by the JEC consortium with two main reasons: first the \n\navailable data is often sketchy and uncertain; second the impact of these additional energy \nrequirements on the total pathway balance is generally small and within the range of \nuncertainty of the total estimations [17]. \n\nThe tank-to-wheel evaluation accounts for the energy expended and the associated GHG \nemitted by the vehicle- fuel combinations. It measures the energy consumption and GHG \n\nemitted when the vehicle is performing the N EDC driving cycle, as a reference for \nhomologation values.  As it is described on the  Well-to-Wheels report, the results announced \non the tables do not and do not attempt to reproduce the average European car fleet [17]. \n\n \nThe results of the energy and GHG well- to-wheels figures combine the well- to-tank expended \n\nenergy, excluding the energy content of the fuel itself, per energy content of the fuel (LHV \nbasis), with the tank-to-wheel energy consumed by the vehicle per unit of distance covered (on \nthe NEDC cycle) [17]. \n\nAs primary energy sources, the JEC Well-to-Wheel considers oil, coal, natural gas, biomass, \nwind and nuclear; and as automotive fuels, it considers gasoline, diesel, liquefied petroleum \n\ngas (LPG), compressed natural gas (CNG), compressed hydrogen and biofuels. As power \ntrains, it considers the conventional spark ignition gasoline and CNG, the compression ignition \ndiesel, and fuel cell vehicles [17]. \n\n \nOverview of results \n\nTable 2 provides an idea of which data is possible to see on the JEC Well- to-Wheels study: \n \n\nTable 2 \u2013 [SoA] J EC c onventional fossil fuels pathways [17]. \n\n Energy MJ/100km GHG gCO2eq/km \n\n WTT TTW WTW WTT TTW WTW \n\nConventional Gasoline       \n\nPISI 2002 31 224 255 28 168 196 \n\nDISI 2002 29 209 238 26 157 183 \n\nPISI 2010 26 190 216 24 140 164 \n\nDISI 2010 26 188 214 24 139 162 \n\nConventional Diesel       \n\nDICI 2002 29 183 212 26 138 164 \n\nDICI 2010 no DPF  27 172 200 24 128 152 \n\nDICI DPF  28 177 205 25 131 156 \n\nConventional LPG       \n\nDICI 2002 26 224 250 18 148 166 \n\nDICI 2010 no DPF  22 190 212 15 126 141 \n\nNote: \n\nPISI = Port Inject ion Spark Ignit ion \n\nDICI = Direct Injection Co mpression Ignition  \n\nDISI = Direct In jection Spark Ignit ion \n\nDPF = Diesel Pa rticu late Filter  \n\n\n\nState of Art \n\n \n\n26 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nThe results are divided on the two phases of the fuel chain: well- to-tank and tank-to-wheel, \n\nshowing both the energy consumption of the vehicle (MJ/100km) and the associated GHG  \nemissions (gCO2eq/km).  \n\nThe presented results do  not make any differentiation between the European refineries or the \noutside EU refineries, providing only average European values for the production and \ndistribution of the fuels.  \n\n \nFor purposes of this dissertation, the JEC Well- to-Wheels was considered an important source \n\nof information as it provides average European va lues for the different phases of the fossil \nfuels chain. \n \n\n \n\n2.2. The White Paper \n \nOne of the most relevant legislative and assessment documents at the European level is the \nWhite Paper for the future of Transport. Developed by the European Commission, the White \n\nPaper plans the policies and draws the roadmap for the transport sector expected in a period of \n10-years. In March 2011, the latest White Paper was published at the European Commission \n\nplatform, outlining what is expected to be the transport?s planning for the next decade [7]. \n \nThe White Paper first characterizes the major challenges that the transport sector is currently \n\nfacing, and then characterizes the main measures that should be implemented to tackle those \nchallenges. Additionally, it develops three different policies scenarios, assessing the individual \n\nimpact that those scenarios have on the final transport situation both by 2020 and long-term \nvision by 2050. \n \n\nMajor challenges  \n\nOne of the main challenges that the European Commission published in the White Paper is the \n\nexpected increase in the transport demand, both in cases of passenger mobility and freight \ntransport. The modelling projections realized by the European Commission shows that, in a no \npolicy change scenario (\u201cbusiness as usual\u201d), the total transport activity is expected to \n\ncontinue to grow in line with economic activity. Total passenger mobility activity would \nincrease by 51% between 2005 and 2050, while freight transport activity would go up by 82%  \n\n[7]. \n \nIn the same context o f growing demand for transport, the associated final energy consumption \n\nis projected to increase by 5% by 2030 and an additional 1% by 2050, driven mainly by \naviation and road freight transport. However, and in a particular segment, the energy use of \n\npassenger cars would drop by 11% between 2005 and 2030. Renewables would represent 10% \nof the total energy for transport by 2020, reflecting the implementation of the renewable \nenergy directive 2009/28/EC. The electrification in the transport sector is projected to remain \n\nslow in the reference scenario, once electric vehicles are predicted to not make significant \ncontributions till 2050 [7]. \n\n \n\n\n\nState of Art \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  27 \n\n \n\nAs major conclusions, the White Paper says that in case of a business as usual, the EU \n\ntransport system would remain continuously dependent on the usage of fossil fuels, in \nparticular the oil products, representing 90% of transport needs. In the case of modal-shift, \n\nonce the business as usual does not make any policy changes, the modal-shift shares would not \ndrastically change compared to the reference scenario. The road sector would therefore remain \nthe dominant mode in both freight and passenger transport [7]. \n\n \nKey measures  \n\nThe deployment of the rail segment is expected to constitute of the main changes that might be \nin place for the next decades. In particular the growing infrastructure on the high-speed rail \nsegment, as well as the expected shift from road freight into rail freight for distances over \n\n300km, would contribute to reduce CO2 emissions. The implementation of a financial \nenvironmental approach for transport charges, such as the \u201cpolluter pays\u201d and \u201cuser pays\u201d \n\nprinciples, are also seen as key measures for regulating the profile pattern usage of the \ntransport system [7]. \n \n\nTackling the urban areas challenges is also foreseen as crucial for future of transport. As key \nparts of the 2050 strategy is, on one hand, the move towards the objective of phasing out the \n\nconventional fuelled cars in cities by 2050, with a shift into electric, hydrogen and hybrid cars, \nas well as in other hand, an increase on the modal-shift into public and collective transport \nmodes. Here, the EU strategic transport technology plan (STTP) is currently giving research \n\nsupport for the deployment of lower emission transport modes for cities, intra-urban and long-\ndistance transport [7]. \n\n \nAs a part of the STTP, is the development of transport audit services for Member States for \ntheir city planning. For doing so, the European Commission is expecting to introduce \n\nprocedures and financial assistance for the development  of urban mobility audits plans.  This \nwill provide to the interested  Member States a tool to plan their urban transport system with \n\nthe objective of finding a best \u201ccost-effective\u201d solution for each city. As additional \ninformation, the city planning would be effective through the implementation of schemes such \nas the access restriction of polluter vehicles, congestion taxes, incentives to modal-shift, \n\nallowing the uptake of low emission vehicles [7]. \n \n\nResume of the policy scenarios  \n\nThe European Commission de veloped different policy option (PO) scenarios: the business as \nusual (PO1), PO2, PO3 and PO4. The impacts were studied on a long-term basis, by 2050. \n\nThe PO2 was designed to show the effect in case of relying less on performance standards \n(technological deployment), and more on managing mobility and on carbon pricing. In this \n\nscenario the Commission assumed that car O EMs would still perform the 95gCO2/km b y \n2020, and that the carbon pricing will reach very high levels. Here, the effect of a high carbon \nprice is viewed as an equivalent effect to the restriction on the usage of fossil transport modes, \n\nfavouring the increase in modal-shift into collective modes[7]. \nThe PO3 was designed to show the effect of policies that emphasise the rapid deployment of \n\nnew powertrains, by imposing demanding CO2 requirements for new vehicles. It can be \nviewed as a low emission vehicle policy oriented scenario (technological deployment) [7]. \n\n\n\nState of Art \n\n \n\n28 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nFinally, the PO4 was designed to represent a medium approach from the last two scenarios \n\n(the PO2 and PO3). It presents intermediate low emission requirements and a carbon pricing \nonly at the urban areas context [7]. \n\nTable 3 provides the summary of the main results from the comparison of the three scenarios. \n \n\nTable 3 \u2013 [SoA] Summary of policy option i mpacts  [7]. \n\n Policy Option 2 Policy Option 3 Policy Option 4 \n\nEconomic impact    \n\nTrans port as  bus iness    \nTransport activity - - = - \n\nModal shift + + = + \nUnit costs per user - - - = - - \n\nOf trans port dynamics on:    \nEconomic growth + + + + + + \n\nEfficiency of the transport system + + + + + + \nCongestion + + = + \n\nHousehold transport costs - - - - - \nTransport-related sectors + + + + + + + \nInnovation and Research + + + + + + \n\nReduction of administrative burden + = + \nSocial impacts    \n\nMobility of citize ns    \nDegree of mobility - - - = - \n\nChoice + + = + + \nAccessibility + + = + + \nDis tributional impacts = - + \nEmployme nt leve l and conditions + + + + + + + \nSafe ty + + = + \nEnvironmental impacts    \n\nClimate change + + + + + + + + + \nAir pollution + + + + + + + \nNoise pollution + + + + + + \nEne rgy use /ene rgy e fficie ncy + + + + + + + + \nRe ne wable  e ne rgy use + + + + + + \nBiodive rs ity + - = \nNote: \n=  baseline or equivalent to PO1 \n\n+ to +++  low to high improvement compared to PO1 \n- to --- low to high worsening compared to PO1 \n\n \n\n\n\nState of Art \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  29 \n\n \n\nAs the Commission concluded, the table shows that from an economic view point, the PO4 \n\nseems to be overall preferable [7].  \nFrom a social view point, the Commission concluded that the PO4 would be the most \n\ndesirable. Compared to the PO2, it does not affect drastically the present lifestyles and \norganisation of society and is therefore expected to have lower social costs of adaptation to \nnew circumstances [7]. \n\nFrom an environmental view point, the PO2 is the most ambitious option since it covers all \nrange of environmental impacts [7]. \n\n \n \n\nWhite Paper conclusions \n\nIn general terms, the modelling activity realized by the European Commission showed that \nseveral policy instruments need to be used to put the transport system on a sustainable path, \n\nlowering CO2 emissions, oil dependency and congestion. It a lso showed that policy action \nneeds to be very ambitious to reach the long-term 2050 objective [7]. \nAs a brief comment and own estimation, the Commission discards the PO3 despite being the \n\nless expensive option to reach the long-term 60% reduction objective. The Commission says \nthat it assumed a high degree of uncertainty associated with technological developments on \n\nthe transport sector [7]. \n \n \n\n2.3. Technical variables \n \n\nThe presentation of the state of art in what regards to the technical variables attempts to show \nthe past and likely future trends on technical variables uptake. It was not always possible to \nfind the average European situation for each technical variable, being therefore presented \n\nstudies that were realized for the individual Member State reality. \n \n\n \n\nEnergy efficiency \n \nIn relation to the efficiency of the vehicle fleet, attention is allocation to two studies realized \non the topic. O ne regards specifically to the Austrian automotive sector and the other regards \n\nto the Danish and Greek case.  \n \n\n \nThe Austrian case \n\nThe study realized by the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), analyzed the \n\nevolving technological profile of the Austrian passenger car fleet from the years of 1990 to \n2007. The motivation of the study was to evaluate the effect of the determinants of the \n\npassenger car fleet, such as the level of car ownership, the pattern of vehicle usage and the \ntechnical performance of the vehicle fleet, on the passenger car related CO2 emissions [18]. \n \n\n\n\nState of Art \n\n \n\n30 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nDespite their consideration for the same year-scope, the year of 2007, for purposes of this \n\ndissertation this article was considered as important since it individually analyzed both the \ngasoline and diesel car fleet. Here, the article analyses the impacts of the consumer choice of \n\nspecific car models, behavioural aspects and technological characteristics that together shaped \nthe scope of the Austrian vehicle fleet fuel efficiency.  \nThe author first developed an Austria fleet database with the registered car models and \n\ncollected information on the equivalent technical charac teristics (power, engine size, weight, \nfuel consumption, by fuel type). Then, the author assessed the influence of the climate \n\noriented policies on the overall fuel efficiency of the passenger car fleet.  \n \nAs main conclusions, the article first concluded that in parallel to the European dieselization \n\ntrend, also in Austria the diesel passenger car fleet has been gaining relevant market shares. In \n1990, the Austria diesel car fleet represented about 14%, increasing to 54% in 2007. \n\nAccording to the calculations, the diesel car fleet showed an annual average efficiency \nimprovement of 1,03%, while the gasoline car fleet presented annual efficiency improvements \nin the order of 1,56%. These two improvements amounted to a reduction in fuel consumption \n\nper 100km by 16% for diesels and 23,7% for gasoline cars, within the observation period \n1990-2007 [18]. \n\nNew registration fuel efficiency use was reduced from an average of 7,1l/100km to about \n6l/100km on the diesel fleet, and from 9,1l/100km to 7l/100km on gasoline fleet. For the total \nfleet, the improvement on the new sales reduced, in average, approximately 2l/100km on 17 \n\nyears, annually 1,67%. In 2007, the average registration car fleet showed a CO2 emission of \nabout 163gCO2/km,  where the diesel average was of 160gCO2/km and the gasoline of \n\n165gCO2/km [18]. \n \nFinally, the study also concluded that this improvement was mainly motivated by government \n\npolicies. Favourable vehicle and fuel taxation for diesels together with the maturing of diesel \ntechnology from car OEMs stimulated the popularity of diesel across all market segments. The \n\nsustained diesel growth was thus stimulated by a successful combination of demand pull and \nsupply push policies [18]. \nDue this situation, the study concluded that the diesel penetration is an excellent practice \n\nexample for studying the market diffusion of a new combustion system and might therefore be \nconsidered in assisting the promotion of energy efficiency systems such as hybrids, electric \n\nand natural gas cars [18]. \n \n \n\nThe Danish and the Greek case \n\nThe study realized by the Laboratory of Industrial &amp; Energy Eco nomics, School of C hemical \n\nEngineering and the National Technical University of Athens, analyses the decomposition of \nthe changes in CO2 emissions from passenger cars in Denmark and Greece, for the period \nbetween 1990 and 2005. These two countries were selected based on their socio-economic \n\ndifferences and the availability of data used in the analysis. In both countries, the article says \nthat passenger cars are responsible for about half of the emissions from road transport, which \n\nis viewed by the author as a similar profile to the EU15 member states [19].  \n \n\n\n\nState of Art \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  31 \n\n \n\nThe article also studied the influence of factors such as the activity in terms of vehicle-km, \n\nannual mileage and the fuel mix on the profile transport CO2 emissions, and how it affected \nthe average fuel efficiency evolution of the car fleet [19]. \n\nTable 4 summarizes the main results achieved on this article in what regards to the average \nfuel efficiency for the diesel and gasoline car fleet.  \n\n \nTable 4 \u2013 [SoA] Summary of re al on-r oad fuel c onsumption.  \n\nl/100km 1990 1995 2000 2005 \n\nDenmark-fleet 8,1 7,9 7,8 7,7 \n\nGasoline cars 8,1 8,0 7,9 7,9 \n\nDiesel cars 6,7 6,6 6,6 6,6 \n\nGreece-fleet 8,1 7,8 7,6 7,6 \n\nGasoline cars 8,1 7,8 7,6 7,5 \n\nDiesel cars 6,9 6,8 7,3 7,7 \n\n \n\n \nThe study concluded that higher average fuel consumption rates for gasoline cars of all engine \nsizes were observed in Greece, reflecting the higher share of cars with older technological \n\nstandards. In Denmark, the study concluded that has been more penetration of new cars, which \nreached an 80% compliance with EURO standards in 2005 [19]. \n\nOn the diesel side, the study concluded that in Greece the higher engine capacity constitute the \nmajority since the 1990s, influencing thus the average fuel consumption of the entire diesel \ncategory of passenger cars [19]. \n\n \nIn general terms, the average fuel consumption of the entire fleet has decreased in both \n\nDenmark and Greece, by 4% and 7%, respectively. In the case of Greece, there has been an \nincreasing penetration of bigger cars (>2.0l), in terms of engine size, however the share of cars \nwith engine size more than 2.0l is still less than 4%, while the respective fraction in Denmark \n\nis close to 10%, increased by 6 percentage units since 1990. Here, the article concluded that \nthis shift to bigger cars in Denmark is the determinant for the restrained decline of the average \nfuel intensity of the fleet, compared to Greece [19]. \n\n \n \n\nNew powertrains and energies \n \n\nWithin the most popular new powertrains that might come in a massive way for the decades to \ncome are the hybrid, electric and hydrogen vehicles. The number of studies assessing on their \nenergy and CO2 impact have been rapidly increasing within the scientific community.  \n\n \nThe Department of Electrical Engineering and Energy Technology from the Vrije Universiteit \n\nBrussel, Belgium, published an article [20] on the topic of which energy source for road \ntransport. The objective of the study was to compare the battery and hybrid electric vehicles \n\n\n\nState of Art \n\n \n\n32 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nwith conventional vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles on the basis of the well- to-wheel \n\nenergy consumption.  \nThe study states that considerable research is still to be performed for improving the \n\nthermodynamics features of the conventional combustion engines. It also says that after 2010, \nhybrids and other alternative solutions could reach a share of 15% increasing up to 25% after \n2020 [20].  \n\n \nOn the topic of hybrid, electric and fuel cell systems, the study highlights the high energy \n\nconsumption reduction that is possible to achieve by electric vehicles when compared to IC E?s, \nabout 40-50% on a well-to-wheel basis. However, the study also highlights that this value can \nbe optimized if taking the real working pattern of the electric vehicle, which influences the \n\nmotor design and power electronic design [20]. \nOn the topic of hybrid vehicles, the study says that this solution allows the usage of the engine \n\nin better efficiency working zones, which enables a tank-to-wheel energy reduction of about \n30%, being the reduction dependent on the grade of hybridisation (partial, mid or full hybrid ) \n[20]. \n\n \nOn the topic of fuel cell electric vehicles, the study concluded that the tank-to-wheel energy \n\nefficiencies need to differentially be considered when comparing to ICE?s. On one hand, fuel \ncell vehicles using compressed hydrogen can provide a 42% tank-to-wheel energy reduction, \nwhile hydrogen fuel cell produced by an on-board methanol reformer can reach a reduction of \n\n32% [20].  \n \n\nDespite the limitations in what regards batteries development and availability of infrastructure, \nthe study also concluded that from a well- to-wheel emission point of view, the results were \npositive and in favour of the electric vehicle. The electric vehicle is viewed by the article as an \n\noptimum solution for urban mobility as it emits no exhaust gases. In what regards thermal-\nhybrid vehicles, the study concluded that the main advantage of this combination is the \n\npermanent interaction between the highly efficient electric sys tem and the thermal engine. Due \nthat dual function, hybrid vehicles have a longer range than electric vehicles, being able to \noffer the option of running on electricity alone in urban environments so producing locally \n\nzero emissions. The hybrid technology is now particularly favoured for heavy-duty vehicles \nsuch as city-buses and leads to 20 % reduction in both energy consumption and CO2 emissions  \n\n[20]. \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nState of Art \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  33 \n\n \n\n2.4. Non-technical variables \n \n\nModal-shift \n \nThe energy and CO2 impacts resulting from a scenario where modal-shift policies would be \n\nput in place was recently assessed by the Energy Technology Policy Division of the \nInternational Energy Agency in Paris [21].  \nThe article assesses the modal-shift worldwide impacts on energy and CO2 at the transport \n\nsector level. A set of projections for the year of 2050 were developed, of which the \u201cBaseline\u201d \nand the \u201cBLUE shift\u201d. The paper described the likely energy and CO2 reduction if a shift from \n\ncar and air travel relative to the \u201cBaseline\u201d will be in place by 2050. For purposes of this \ndissertation, this article was of important both from an absolute quantity view point, and from \na conceptual and methodology view point [21]. \n\n \nTo evaluate the modal-shift impacts, the article used the mobility model MoMo to quantify the \n\nenergy usage and GHG emissions from the transport sector, till 2050. As a brief description, \nthe MoMo model consists in a spreadsheet aimed at estimating and projecting travel indicators, \nenergy consumption, pollutant emissions and greenhouse gas generated from worldwide \n\nmobility. The basic structure of the model calculates the energy use as a function of energy/km \nx km/vehicle x number of vehicles. Since the MoMo model contains elasticity capabilities, the \n\nstudy used those capabilities to develop \u201cwhat- if\u201d scenarios, changing travel projections and \nevaluating the energy and CO2 impacts [21]. \n \n\nThe paper described the methodology used for each global region such as America, Asia or \nEurope, through the consultation of original databases for each region, gathering all the \ninformation related to vehicle characteristics, driving patterns, energy types, etc. The resulting \n\nbase year (2005) picture for passe nger travel by mode per capita is shown in Figure 7 [21]. \n \n\n \nFigure 7 \u2013 [SoA] P assenger mobility per capita per  worl d region [21]. \n\n \n\n\n\nState of Art \n\n \n\n34 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \n\nHaving developed the characteristic year, the study continues to project a modal-shift scenario. \nTo model the modal shifts, the study explains that a new module has been added into the \n\nMoMo aiming to quantify the energy use and GHG emissions. Changing modal travel shares, \nusing total passenger-km per year, by mode and also by region, were the basis factors for the \nanalysis. Also, absolute indicators such as the quantity of passengers-km were split into urban \n\nor non- urban areas, using percentage levels extracted from national surveys [21]. \n \n\nIt will be not characterized each assumption that the study assumed for each world region, but \nonly to characterize the OECD Europe, as representative of the European Union life style \npattern. \n\nOn the case of OEC D Europe, the study assumes an urban rail travel by 2050 to be nearly \n100% higher in the \u201cBLUE Shift\u201d scenario when compared to the Baseline, while urban bus \n\ntravel was assumed to be 50% higher. For the non-urban travel, the growth in air travel is cut \nby half, doubling in the \u201cBLUE shift\u201d scenario rather than tripling as it does in the Baseline, \nand intercity rail travel triples when compared to 2005 and doubles when compared to the \n\nBaseline 2050 [21].  \nRegarding specifically the passenger car sector, in both regions (O ECD and non-OECD), the \n\nstudy says that reductions in car travel were allocated partially to a reduction in vehicle stocks \nand partially to a reduction in travel per vehicle [21]. \n \n\nAs general results from the study, the Figure 8 shows the results of a \u201cBLUE shift\u201d scenario \ncompared to the Baseline.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 8 \u2013 [SoA] GHG e missions scenario comparison  [21]. \n\n \n\n \nAs general conclusions of interest for this dissertation, the study first concluded that given a \n\n25% reduction in car and air travel in 2050, it could be potentially possible a 20% reduction in \nenergy consumption and CO2 emissions compared to the Baseline. However, the study also \nconcluded that these reductions would only be possible if strong policies would be put in place \n\nto guide the transport system in this modal share mix. \n\n\n\nState of Art \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  35 \n\n \n\nHigh-speed rail \n \nA study realized by the Division of Environmental Strategies Research from the Royal \n\nInstitute of Technology, Sweden [22], assessed on the role of the high-speed rail segment in \nmitigating climate change. The study focused on the modal-shift from air and road travel into \nhigh-speed rail, both for the purposes of passenger mobility and freight transport. It assessed \n\nparticularly to the Swedish case, saying that it can potentially be extended to the European \nreality. \n\n \nFor doing so, the article presents two different scenarios: the \u201cReference\u201d and the \u201cHSR and \nFreight measures\u201d. The \u201cReference\u201d scenario means the scenario where no high-speed rail \n\ninfrastructure is implemented, and the \u201cHSR and Freight measures\u201d means the scenario where \nthe proposed high-speed line is constructed with some additional incentive measures to usage \n\nof the remaining conventional rail lines to freight transport. The study expects that in a general \nview point the construction of the high-speed line offers the potential for an extension of the \nconventional rail lines to increase the capacity for freight trains and regional trains [22]. \n\n \nIn all the scenarios for 2025/2030, the study considers the likely transports journeys that the \n\nproposed high-speed line might serve: to Denmark, to Germany and to the Netherlands. For \nthese services, the article resumes the assumptions taken in what regards the market share of \nhigh-speed rail in two tracks: 80% for Stockholm- Gothenburg, 65% for Stockholm-Malmo. It \n\nalso compares to other services in Europe such as Madrid-Seville 84%, Paris- Lyon 90%. As a \nfirst step in the methodology, the Table 5 presents the differences between the analyzed \n\nscenarios in terms of passengers-km for each analyzed transport sub- mode [22]. \n \n\nTable 5 \u2013 [SoA] P assenger and freight de mand by scenario [22]. \n\nBillion 2007 Reference 2025/2030  HSR and Freight 2025/2030 \n\nPassenger pkm    \n\nTrain 10,9 18,6 24,8 \n\nCar 103,3 123,2 121,4 \n\nAircraft 8,7 11,2 9,8 \n\nFreight tkm    \n\nTrain 27,1 36,8 46,4 \n\nTruck 47,1 52,7 44,6 \n\nShip 35,2 38,2 36,8 \n\n \n \n\nAccording to the original forecast, the shift from car travel to rail seems to be the highest, the \nstudy concluded. The study assumed that the proposed high-speed line would cause a 50% \n\nshift from car to rail, meaning about 15% of long-distance car travel over 100km shifting to \nrail, in line with other studies mentioned in the article [22]. \n \n\n\n\nState of Art \n\n \n\n36 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nAs a final step and of interest for this dissertation, the study presents the specific energy use \n\nand greenhouse gas emissions for propulsion and fuel life cycle. The study collected external \ndata sources for tank-to-wheel energy consumption for the modes of airplanes and passenger \n\ncars, and assumed the electric trains energy consumption own values [22]. \n \nTable 6 shows the results of the study in the well-to-wheel CO2 emissions per pkm or ton.km, \n\nfor passenger and freight transportation.  \n  \n\nTable 6 \u2013 [SoA] S pecific CO2 e missions for different modes  [22]. \n\n Vehicle propulsion Fuel production Both \n\nPassenger gCO2eq/pkm    \n\nTrain, electric 0 8 8 \n\nCar, fossil 58 5 63 \n\nCar, biofuel 0 29 29 \n\nAircraft, fossil 142 9 140 \n\nFreight gCO2eq/ton.km    \n\nTrain, electric 0 5,8 5,8 \n\nTruck, fossil 49 3 52 \n\nTruck, biofuel 0 26 26 \n\n \n\n \nThe study concluded that the well- to-wheel CO2 emissions per pkm of electric train would be \nas about 8gCO2/pkm, compared to the 63gCO2/pkm of a passenger car, and the \n\n150gCO2/pkm of the considered airplane model [22].  \nAs an additional and important factor, the study also allowed gaining the conscience that \n\nbiofuels are much more carbon intense in what regards the fuel product ion (well-to-tank) \nwhen compared to the conventional fossil fuels.  \n \n\n \n\n2.5. Addressing 2020 objectives \n \nThe need for a high technical deployment and shift for transport?s energy future was recently \n\nassessed by the Institute of Energy Economics and Rational Use of Energy (IER), from \nStuttgart, Germany [23], which projected four different scenarios for future of energy?s sector \n(industry, household and transport). The scenarios named the \u201cReference\u201d (business as usual), \n\nthe \u201c450ppm\u201d (climate protection), the \u201cOLGA\u201d (climate protection + securit y of supply), and \nthe \u201cO LGA_NUC \u201d (climate protection + security of supply + enhanced nuclear energy), \nprojects the likely energy and CO2 situation that might be in place by 2050.  \n\n \nCompared to the \u201cReference\u201d scenario and despite the efficiency improvements of the vehicles \n\nused, the final energy consumption of the transport sector will likely increase from the \nreference level of 14.620PJ to a business as usual scenario of 19.612PJ expected by 2050. The \nmain driver contributing for this increase is the expected strong growth of transport services, \n\n\n\nState of Art \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  37 \n\n \n\nespecially in road freight transport and aviation. It is also expected that motorised individual \n\ntransport will strongly increase in newer member states (EU12) in parallel with a slight growth \nin older member states (EU15). The projected disproportionately high increase in the usage of \n\ndiesel in transport is based on the expected rising transport services in road freight transport \nwhile, at the same time, the replacement of gasoline cars by diesel ones. The promotion of \nalternative fuelled cars such as natural gas and LPG is seen as remaining with marginal market \n\nshares [23]. \n \n\nIn the \u201c450ppm\u201d scenario, the final energy consumption in the transport sector resulted in few \ndifferences for the years until 2030 compared to the reference scenario.  In 2030, an increasing \nusage of biofuels, especially second generation biofuels can likely be observed. Here, the \n\nconsumption of biofuels occurs basically in addition to conventional gasoline and diesel, in a \nblend mixture. For other energy carriers like hydrogen, the study expects that after 2040 it will \n\nbecome more popular as fuel cell vehicles starts to gain relevant market shares. The increasing \nuse of electricity is expected to be verified, once the deployment of the electric and plug in \nhybrid vehicles segment start to spread [23]. \n\nIn absolute numbers, the final energy consumption of the transport sector is expected to be \nreduced under the conditions of a climate protection scenario compared to the business as \n\nusual development till 2030. In 2050, the total final energy consumption in the climate \nprotection scenario is about 14% lower (2.688PJ) compared to the business as usual one [23]. \n \n\nThe final energy consumption till 2020 is just slightly different in the \u201cOLGA\u201d scenario \ncompared to the others. The additional restrictions of a security of supply scenario in te rms of \n\nlimited oil imports result in a decreasing usage of petroleum based fuels. In the other scenarios \n(excluding business as usual), the vehicle stock in 2050 is expected to be dominated by fuel \ncell and electric vehicles as well as plug in hybrids. The share of diesel vehicles restricted to \n\nroad freight transportation and bus transport remains high [23]. \n \n\nIn relation to the likely CO2 reductions, the study concluded that in case of a climate \nprotection scenario in combination with a higher oil price, the CO2 avoidance costs could \neventually lead, for example, for the earlier penetration of biofuels in the transport sector. It \n\ncould be potentially possible to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by 6% in the non-ETS \nsector, albeit not enough to meet the 10% under the European C limate Energy Package. In the \n\n\u201cOLGA\u201d scenario, the non-ETS sector could reach and overtake the 10% reduction objective, \nas the study calculated a potential 22% reduction. On an \u201cOLGA_NUC \u201d scenario, the study \ncalculated a potential 19% greenhouse gas reduction, lower when compared to the \u201cOLGA\u201d \n\ndue the reduction achieved by the ETS sector (nuclear power favours the electricity \ngreenhouse gas reduction) [23]. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  39 \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 3 \n\nMETHODOLOGY \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n40 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMethodology \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  41 \n\n \n\n3. Methodology \n \nThe study of the well- to-wheel energy and CO2 impacts resulting from the uptake of technical \n\nand non-technical measures requires the development of an interactive tool, allowing the \nmanipulation of several variables associated to the transport sector.  \n\nFor purposes of this dissertation, technical measures are those which refer to the energy \nefficiency, the renewable energies and new power trains; while the non-technical measures \nrefers to the modal-shift into collective transport modes, including the deployment of the high-\n\nspeed rail segment. All measures should interact together and across all transport modes, \nallowing its individual manipulation leading to the assessment on the well- to-wheel energy \n\nand CO2 impacts. Resulting from the combination of all measures, will be possible to build a \nbest future scenario for 2020.  \n \n\nIn this chapter it will be characterized the adopted model structure, the mindset and calculation \nflow, as well as the main assumptions behind the calculations.  \n\n \n \n\n3.1. The model\u2019s structure \n \nIt was decided to set up a model structure based on the format of a spreadsheet bringing \n\ntogether all the technical and non-technical variables that influence the transport?s \nperformance. Two spreadsheets were developed for this purpose: one for energy consumption \nand other for CO2 emissions. \n\n \nAfter several improvements and considering potential new inputs, it was decided to display on \n\nthe left side all the transport modes, their respective sub-modes, powertrains and energy \ncarriers; and on the top side the other variables such as the energy and CO2 efficiency, the \noccupancy rate, the passenger mobility and  freight transport information, all separated in a \n\nwell-to-wheel basis.

It was assumed that all \n\nair transport sub- modes are included in a general category. This decision was supported both \nby the general knowledge and by observation of the current air transport situation, which tells \nthat is enough reasonable to assume that these modes represent a minimum fraction o f the total \n\nair energy, CO2 and passenger mobility picture.  \nFigure 10 shows the way on how the air sector was divided. \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure 10 \u2013 [Methodol ogy] Air sector de tails . \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nLeft side\n\nAir sector Airplanes\n\nRail sector\n\nMetro &amp; tram\n\nNormal-speed\n\nHigh-speed\n\nRoad sector\n\nBus\n\nCar\n\nMoto\n\nPassenger van\n\nFreight\n\nSea sector\n\n\n\nMethodology \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  43 \n\n \n\nRail sector \n\nFor the rail sector case, it was decided to c haracterize the individual contribution of the main \nrail sub- modes currently in use : metro/tram, normal- and high-speed rail, by energy type. It \n\nwas assumed that only electricity and diesel are currently being consumed by the rail sector, \nignoring the consumption of solid fuels, as they represent a minimum fraction on the total rail \nenergy, 0,06% [11]. O n the passenger mobility and freight transport scene, it was decided that \n\nonly normal-speed rail is currently being used for freight transport purposes, while metro/tram, \nnormal- and high-speed is used for passenger mobility purposes.  \n\nFigure 11 shows the way on how the rail sector was divided. \n \n \n\n \nFigure 11 \u2013 [Methodol ogy] Rail sector details . \n\n \n\n \nRoad sector \n\nFor the road sector case, the objective was to individual study the details of the road passenger \nmobility, in particular the bus and the car sub- modes, and the contribution of the road freight \ntransport to the total energy and CO2 picture. The consideration of passenger sub- modes such \n\nas motorcycle and passenger vans was influenced by the Tremove model, as it was the base  \nsource used for the development and characterization of the road fleet composition.  \n\nThe analysis of the road freight transport for the total road energy and CO2 picture is grouped \nin the \u201cFreight\u201d category. Here, the objective was not the study of the differences between \nheavy or light duty trucks, being everything included on the same category.  \n\nFigure 12 shows the way on how the road sector was divided. \n \n\n\n\nMethodology \n\n44 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 12 \u2013 [Methodol ogy] Road sector de tails . \n\n \n \n\nSea sector \n\nFor this dissertation only the contribution to the total transport energy and CO2 picture of the \nsea sector was calculated.

The calculation flow \n \nBuilding a consistent energy transport model while defining the mathematical relations \n\nbetween its parameters, can almost entirely rely on the implemented methodology and \ncalculation flow. A large variety of methodologies and calculation flows can be used in \nfunction of the adopted structure but, for purposes of this dissertation, it was decided to \n\nrespect the previously described structure and re stricting the calculation options to two. \n \n\nUnder the defined structure, in one hand, it can be first introduced the energy efficiency \nfactors (energy and CO2 per km) and the total annual mileage (in km), obtaining then a result \nof the total energy consumed through the multiplication of those two inputs. As an example, \n\nthe following equation shows the concept behind this option: \n \n\n Eq. 1  \n\n \n\n Eq. 2  \n\n \n\n\n\nMethodology \n\n48 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nOn other hand, the energy efficiency can be calculated on the opposite way: first introduce the \n\ntotal energy consumption and the total annual mileage, and then obtain a result to the energy \nefficiency through the division of the two inputs: \n\n \n\n Eq. 3  \n\n \n\n Eq. 4  \n\n \n \n\nFigure 22 attempts to describe the two possible calculation flows: \n\n \n\n  \n \n\nFigure 22 \u2013 [Methodol ogy] Calcul ation flow opti ons.  \n\n \n  \n\nAs it was explained on the State of Art, the Eurostat data on energy consumption and transport \n\nstatistics was consider as the most representative source of data for the current European \nsituation. Hence, its information on energy consumption quantities refers to the total tank-to-\n\nwheel energy consumption and therefore  the methodology and calculation flow selected was \nthe second on the previous Figure 22. \n \n\nThus, the decision was to start with the total tank-to-wheel energy consumption from the \nEurostat, divide it by the Eurostat passenger mobility data, and obtain a result for the energy \n\nefficiency, in terms of energy per pkm.  \n \n\n Eq. 5  \n\n \n \n\nINPUT:\n\nAnnual \nmileage\n\n[km]\n\nOUTPUT:\n\nTOTAL \nEnergy \n\nand CO2\n\nINPUT:\n\nEnergy and \nCO2 \n\nefficiency\n\nOUTPUT\n\nEnergy and \nCO2 \n\nefficiency\n\nINPUT:\n\nTOTAL \nEnergy \n\nand CO2\n\nINPUT:\n\nAnnual \nmileage\n\n[km]\n\n\n\nMethodology \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  49 \n\n \n\n3.2.1. The need to resort to external sources \n \nFor the purpose of this dissertation the Eurostat data is not enough detailed and does not allow \n\nby itself to complete the transport model required on this dissertation. The need to input \nexternal data sources is crucial and its introduction will depend on the availability of the \nEurostat data and the detail level reached on this dissertation. \n\nIn order to provide a better understanding of which and on where external data sources will be \nrequired, it will be now explained the overall calculation steps, characterized the available \n\nEurostat information and referred where external sources will be introduced.  \n \n \n\nFirst step \n\nIn a first calculation phase,  if the total tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 data from the Eurostat \n\nwas divided by the Eurostat passenger mobility data, this would provide a first average tank-\nto-wheel energy and CO2 efficiency value in terms of MJ/pkm and gCO2/pkm. \n \n\n Eq. 5  \n\n \n \n\nSecond step \n\nIn a second calculation phase, if the previous figure of MJ/pkm and gCO2/pkm was multiplied \n\nby the occupancy rate, this would provide an average tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 \nefficiency value, in terms of MJ/km and gCO2/km.  \nFor the purpose of this dissertation, the value of occupancy rate refers to the average number \n\nof passengers per vehicle (passengers/vehicle) and should be representative of the European \naverage situation, per sub- mode of transport. Here, the Eurostat does not provide values  on the \n\naverage number of passengers per vehicle for all sub- modes of transport, creating the need to \nuse external sources of data. \n\n \n\n Eq. 6  \n\n \n\n \n\nThird step \n\nIn a third calculation phase, if the previous figure of MJ/km and gCO2/km was multiplied by a \nratio obtained from external sources, this would correspond to the average energy and CO2 \n\nefficiency needed, in terms of energy and CO2 per km, for the production of the necessary \nenergy to meet the previously calculated demand tank-to-wheel. Here, the Eurostat does not \nprovide values of well- to-tank average energy efficiency per km and therefore external sources \n\nof data will be required.  \n \n\n Eq. 7  \n\n \n\n\n\nMethodology \n\n50 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nFourth step \n\nIn a fourth calculation phase, if summing the previously calculated values of well- to-tank and \ntank-to-wheel, this would provide a well-to-wheel value in terms of energy and CO2 per km. \n\n \n\n Eq. 8  \n\n \n \nThen, through the division of the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel values by the occupancy rate, \n\nbuild the correspondent values but now in terms of energy and CO2 per pkm. \n \n\n Eq. 9  \n\n \n\n Eq. 10 \n\n \n \n\nFinal step \n\nIn a final calculation phase, if multiplying each previously calculated value of well-to-tank and \nwell-to-wheel (in terms of energy and CO2 per pkm) by the published Eurostat passenger \n\nmobility information (pkm), this would provide the total energy values both for the well-to-\ntank and the well- to-wheel basis. \n\n \n\n Eq. 11 \n\n \n\n Eq. 12 \n\n \n \n\nAs a remember to the reader, doing this calculation with the tank-to-wheel energy per pkm and \nthe Eurostat passenger mobility data will result in the Eurostat energy and CO2 values: \n\n \n\n Eq. 13 \n\n \n \n\nFinal comment \n\nThe Eurostat does not provide all the information required for purposes of this dissertation, \nshowing a lack of information on all the details associated to the transport?s activity and \n\nperformance. Data such as the European average number of passengers per vehicle, by \ntransport sub- mode and by energy type, the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel energy efficiency \n\n\n\nMethodology \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  51 \n\n \n\nper km and per pkm, both by transport sub- mode and by energy type, as well as the passenger \n\nmobility by energy type, are some of the main variables that the Eurostat does not provide and \nare required for this dissertation. \n\nThe presented calculation flow was the general mindset used  to calculate and construct both \nthe energy and CO2 tables required for purposes of this dissertation. However, in function of \nthe available data and the required detail level, other methodologies will be used. In that case, \n\ndedicated explanations will be provided on the dedicated chapters for each sub-mode. \n \n\n \n\n3.3. Well-to-wheel scope \n \n\nThe well-to-wheel analysis of the consumed energy by the transport sector accounts the \nenergy for the extraction, transportation, refining and the delivery into the pump stations. For \n\npurposes of this dissertation, evaluating the energy and CO2 well-to-wheels impacts from the \nusage of electricity as energy carrier for transport was also required and hence, the differences \non the well- to-wheel scope adopted on this dissertation need to be clarified and will be \n\nexplained on this chapter.  \n \n\n \n\n3.3.1. The JEC well-to-wheel scope \n \nAs described before, the \u201cJEC Well- to-Wheels\u201d study [17] was considered a reliable source of \ninformation for the calculation of well- to-tank average energy efficiency for the common \n\nmotor fuels. According to its definition, it considers all the steps since the extraction until the \ndelivery at the pump station, such as the extraction and refinery at the source, the \ntransportation of the fuels into the markets (national or regional level), and the distribution \n\ninto the pump stations. Figure 23 shows the adopted scope on the JEC Well- to-Wheels study. \n \n \n\n \nFigure 23 \u2013 [Methodol ogy] J EC well-to-tank scope [17]. \n\n \n\nPrimary \nEnergy\n\nProduction \nand \n\nconditioning\nShipping Refining\n\nDelivery to \nthe pump\n\nGasoline, \ndiesel, etc\n\n\n\nMethodology \n\n52 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n3.3.2. The electricity well-to-wheel scope \n \nThe Eurostat electricity consumption data refers to the electric ity delivered on the network and \n\navailable for final consumption. In that case, it was considered on this dissertation that the \ncalculation of the well- to-tank energy consumption should consider all the steps from the \nprimary energy source to the final consumption. \n\nIt was considered that the calculation should take into account the transmission and \ndistribution (T&amp;D) losses from the power plant into the final consumption point,  and the \n\nefficiency of the EU?s electricity production system. This allows calculating the primary \nenergy needed to produce the electricity at the output of the power plant as well as its energy \nlosses on the grid. Figure 24 shows the adopted well-to-wheel electricity scope: \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure 24 \u2013 [Methodol ogy] Elec tricity adopte d well-to-tank scope. \n\n \n \n\nThe electricity well- to-tank analysis takes into account the primary energy needed at the \nentrance of the power plant, the associated energy efficiency of EU?s power plants, and the \n\nenergy losses at the transmission and distribution lines.  \nBy its side, the tank-to-wheel electricity consumption refers to the electricity consumed at the \nelectricity grid level, b y the train, or electric vehicle. \n\n \n \n\n3.3.3. Scope differences \n \n\nThere are two major differences rising up from these considerations: first the \u201cJEC Well-to-\nWheels\u201d study considers the energy needed in the steps of extracting, refining and transporting \ninto the pump, in comparison with the no consideration of those steps on the electricity well-\n\nto-tank analysis; second the \u201cJEC Well-to-Wheels\u201d study does not consider the primary \nenergy itself (oil) while the considered electricity well- to-tank scope considers it.  \n\nPrimary \nenergy \n\n(nuclear, \ncoal, etc)\n\nProduction \nand \n\nconditioning\nShipping\n\nProcess at \nthe power \n\nplant\n\nDelivery on \nthe network\n\nFinal \nelectricity\n\n\n\nMethodology \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  53 \n\n \n\nTable 7 summarizes the main differences: \n\n \nTable 7 \u2013 [Methodol ogy] Well-to-wheel scope di fferences  \n\n Primary energy Extract Refining Final delivery Final use \n\nJEC - + + + + \n\nElectricity \n\nadopted \n+ - - + + \n\nNote: \n\n- means no \n\n+ means yes \n\n \n \n\nThe \u201cJEC Well- to-Wheels\u201d scope considers all the steps assoc iated to the extraction, \ntransformation and transportation into the final consumption point (the pump station), while \nthe adopted electricity well- to-tank scope considers the primary energy needed at the power \n\nplant, but does not take into account neither the extraction of the primary energy neither its \ntransportation into the power plant?s location. This is the main difference between the \u201cJEC\u201d \n\nscope and the electricity adopted scope.  \n \nFor purposes of this dissertation, it was decided to use this methodolo gy under the knowledge \n\nthat this consideration might not provide exact and accurate values. Howe ver, it was also \nconsidered and assumed that the steps of extraction and transportation in the case of electricity \n\nrepresent a lower percentage compared to the primary energy itself, meaning that this scope \npotentially provides an acceptable value for the electricity?s well-to-tank. \n \n\n \n\n3.3.4. Scope methodology differences \n \nAs previously mentioned, it was the objective of this dissertation to provide potential energy \nand CO2 well-to-wheel contributions to the total transport picture. The used methodology to \n\nreproduce those potentials is explained as follows.  \n \n\n \n\nFossil liquid fuels \n\n \nAs described before, it was considered the \u201cJEC Well-to-Wheels\u201d study as reference source on \nthe analysis of the well- to-tank liquid fuels. According to the previously presented Table 2, the \n\ninteresting data for purposes of this thesis is as follows: \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nMethodology \n\n54 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nTable 8 \u2013 [Methodol ogy] J EC Well-to-wheel crude oil deri ve d fuels  [17]. \n\n Energy MJ/100km GHG gCO2eq/km \n\nWTT TTW WTW WTT TTW WTW \n\nConventional Gasoline       \n\nPISI 2002 31 224 255 28 168 196 \n\nDISI 2002 29 209 238 26 157 183 \n\nPISI 2010 26 190 216 24 140 164 \n\nDISI 2010 26 188 214 24 139 162 \n\nConventional Diesel       \n\nDICI 2002 29 183 212 26 138 164 \n\nDICI 2010 no DPF  27 172 200 24 128 152 \n\nDICI DPF  28 177 205 25 131 156 \n\nConventional LPG       \n\nDICI 2002 26 224 250 18 148 166 \n\nDICI 2010 no DPF  22 190 212 15 126 141 \n\n \n\n \nFrom this table it is possible to visualize an example of the well- to-wheel energy consumption \nand GHG emissions for the common pathways of each fossil liquid fuel. Data on energy per \n\nkm and CO2eq emissions per km is provided for the well- to-tank, tank-to-wheel and well-to-\nwheel basis. \n\n \nOn this dissertation, it was decided to evaluate the well-to-tank impacts on a simple but \nassumed as representative way. It was assumed that the ratio between the well- to-tank and the \n\ntank-to-wheel, in terms of %, remains constant respecting the tank-to-wheel. It means that the \nwell-to-tank energy consumption and greenhouse gases emissions vary in the same proportion \n\nas the tank-to-wheel energy consumption and CO2 emissions varies. \n \nAs an example, selecting the gasoline 2002 information presented on the previous table, it is \n\npossible to calculate an average ratio between the well-to-tank and the tank-to-wheel for the \nenergy and GHG: \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n \n\n\n\nMethodology \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  55 \n\n \n\nThese results means that 13,9% of the energy consumed on the tank-to-wheel, in terms of \n\nenergy/km, corresponds to the well-to-tank energy/km needed to extract, transform and deliver \nthe fuel into the pump station. For example, if the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency of gasoline \n\ncars is about 2,8MJ/km, the needed well- to-tank energy efficiency is 0,39MJ/km.  \n \n\n  \n\n \n \n\nThe same logic was applied to the CO2 calculation but with the respective CO2 ratio.  \n \nThis was the methodology adopted for the well- to-tank calculation of fossil liquid fuels. After \n\ncalculating all ratios for the most common fuel types, it was possible to build a summary table \nwith the used ratios on this dissertation.  \n\n \nNote: in the present case the values of 2002 were used for the reference case (2007) and the \nvalues of 2010 for the 2020 scenarios. Table 9 shows the used ratios on this dissertation: \n\n \nTable 9 \u2013 [Methodol ogy] Well-to-tank energ y and CO2 ratios.  \n\n%\n wheeltank to\n\n tank towell\n \n\n2007 2020 \n\nEnergy CO2 Energy CO2 \n\nGasoline 13,9% 16,6% 13,8% 17,2% \n\nDiesel 15,8% 18,8% 15,8% 18,9% \n\nLPG 11,6% 12,2% 11,6% 11,9% \n\nCNG 12,1% 14,5% 11,7% 14,8% \n\nBioethanol 164,1% (1) 164,4% (1) \n\nBiodiesel 121,6% (1) 121,5% (1) \n\nBiogas   87,2% (1) \n\n(1) Depends on the considered pathway as described on the directive 2009/28/ EC.  \n\n \n \n\nThe higher percentage for the biofuels means the higher energy- intense associated process for \nthe extraction, transformation and production compared to the common fossil fuels.

Here, the CO2 factors that are provided by \nthe renewable energy directive 2009/28/EC were used. Table 12 shows the adopted biofuels \n\nCO2 factors: \n \n\n\n\nMethodology \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  57 \n\n \n\nTable 12 \u2013 [Methodol ogy] Biofuels used CO2 fac tors [24]. \n\ngCO2/MJ  \n\nBioethanol from sugar cane 24 \n\nBiodiesel from rape seed  52 \n\n \n \n\nAccording to the point number C13 of the Annex V of the renewable energy directive \n(2009/28/EC), it is written that the emissions from the fuel use (tank-to-wheel) shall be taken \n\nto be zero for the cases of biofuels and bioliquids. Therefore, the presented values on \ngCO2/MJ regard to the well- to-wheel CO2 emissions per unit of consumed tank-to-wheel \nenergy. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \nBiofuel well-to-tank energy calculation methodology \n\n \nThe previously announced biofuels ratios (in Table 9) of well-to-tank on the tank-to-wheel \ncould be directly applied in the case of using a 100% biofuel mixture. In the real and future \n\nsituation, it is likely possible that biofuels will be used in a blend mixture with other fossil \nfuels. In that case, the calculation of the well-to-tank energy and CO2 efficiency per km \n\ncannot rely on those announced ratios of biofuels but rely on an average calculation between \nthe fossil and the biofuels mixture. \nIn this dissertation, a simple calculation was adopted in order to determine a contribution from \n\nthe usage of biofuels and consider its energy- intense process. It was decided to consider the \nenergy relative weight of fossil and biofuels in the mixture, and apply it to the previously \n\ncalculated ratios. \n \nAs an example, if all the gasoline cars consumed about 4.444PJ of energy in 2007, of which \n\n4.400PJ were gasoline and 44PJ were bioethanol, it means that exists a gasoline and \nbioethanol energy mixture of 99% and 1% respectively.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \nTaking a tank-to-wheel energy efficiency of about 2,8MJ/km, the calculation of the well-to-\ntank energy efficiency will take into account the percentage of gasoline (99%) and bioethanol \n\n\n\nMethodology \n\n58 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n(1%) together with the well- to-tank ratios for gasoline (13,9%) and bioethanol (164,1%). Then, \n\nan average well-to-tank energy value is calculated : \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \nThe calculation of the well-to-tank CO2 efficiency is slightly different.  \n \n\n \n\nBiofuel well-to-tank CO2 calculation methodology \n\n \nTaking the gasoline example, 202gCO2/km, it was calculated the well-to-tank CO2 efficiency \nfrom the usage of gasoline, through the usage of the previously calculated CO2 ratios of \n\ngasoline and bioethanol, together with its percentages in the mixture.  \nHere is the calculation of the gasoline contribution: \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n \n\nThen, it was calculated the contribution of the well-to-tank CO2 efficiency from the usage of \n\nbioethanol. Here, it was first calculated the well- to-tank CO2 efficiency in case of bioethanol \nblend of 100% and then apply the relative energy weight of bioethanol in the mixture. As \n\nshown before, it was considered bioethano l produced from sugar cane (24gCO2/MJ): \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \nThis means that if a gasoline car with the energy efficiency of 2,8MJ/km would run with a \nbioethanol mixture of 100% (only bioethanol), it would release about 67gCO2/km on the well-\n\nto-tank basis. Since the bioethanol mixture is not 100%, it should be calculated with the real \nmixture: \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n \n\nAnd the final value of well-to-tank CO2 efficiency should be the sum of the gasoline and \n\nbioethanol contribution: \n \n\n  \n\n\n\nMethodology \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  59 \n\n \n\nThis was a very simple way of calculation adopted on this dissertation. It was decided to take \n\nthis methodology because it respects the limits of having 0% or 100% biofuel mixture, \nproviding always the extreme energy and CO2 scenarios.  \n\nOn this way of calculation it is being assumed a linearity of energy and CO2 emissions in \nfunction of the mixture, what for purposes of having mathematical relations on the model, this \nwas viewed as a consistent way of providing general valuable results.  \n\n \n \n\nElectricity \n \nUnder the scope limitations described on the previous chapter, the two concepts related to the \nenergy losses on the electricity chain regards to the transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) losses, \nand the average energy efficiency of EU?s electricity production system. \n\n \nAccording to a report published by ABB Inc. [25], the typical T&amp;D losses on the electricity \n\nnetwork are in the range of magnitude of 6-8% [25] of the electricity tra nsferred, which \ncorresponds to an efficiency of 92-94%. \n \n\nRegarding the average efficiency of the EU?s electricity production system, the European \nEnergy Agency advances a value of 48%  [26] representative of the conventional thermal \n\nplants in 2007. This figure only includes the combustion thermal plants (coal, gas and oil) and \nexcludes other major electricity contributors such as nuclear and hydro.  \nHere, given the large contribution of nuclear and to some extend  hydro, the figure of 48% \n\ncould be slightly different as, for example, nuclear?s efficiency can reach higher values.  \nHaving in mind these limitations, the value of 48% was used on this dissertation, based on the \nconsideration that it likely represents the order of magnitude of EU?s situation. \n\nFigure 25 shows the scope with the assumed values: \n \n\n \nFigure 25 \u2013 [Methodol ogy] Elec tricity W TT efficiency val ues.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMethodology \n\n60 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nFor the calculation of the CO2 emissions, it was first necessary to analyze which data could be \n\npossible to use for this effect. Here, browsing on the Eurostat database, it is possible to extract \ninformation about the total electricity produced on the EU, and its associated CO2 emissions.  \n\nIn 2007, the EU produced 3.362TWh [11] of electricity which emitted about 1.393Mt of CO2 \n[11]. With these values, it was possible to build an indicator of the CO2 emissions per unit of \nelectricity produced: \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nThis means that in average, each mega joule of electricity produced within the EU emits about \n115 grams of CO2. The usage of this factor requires the calculation of the respective \n\nelectricity produced at the output plant level, and not the electricity consumed value at the \ntransmission line (final point). Figure 26 shows the mindset behind this calculation: \n \n\n \nFigure 26 \u2013 [Methodol ogy] Elec tricity power pl ant output.  \n\n \n \n\nImagining the case of electric trains, the calc ulation of its energy consumption at the output of \nthe power plant should consider the T&amp;D losses. This means that the tank-to-wheel energy \nconsumption (MJ/km) obtained from the calculation on the transport model should be divided \n\nby 92%, in order to have the correspondent energy consump tion at the output of the power \nplant. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  61 \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 4 \n\nMODEL \n\nDEVELOPMENT  \n\nAND CALIBRATION \n \n\n\n\n \n\n62 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  63 \n\n \n\n4. Model development and calibration \n \nThe purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate the construction steps used to calculate the well-\n\nto-tank, the tank-to-wheel and the well- to-wheel energy and CO2 efficiencies (in terms of \ngCO2 and MJ per km and per pkm), the total energy and CO2 quantities for each transport \nmode and sub- mode, and the passenger mobility by energy type also for each sub- mode of \n\ntransport. \nGiven the different available data types and the necessary approach for all calculations, \n\nindividual analysis mode-by- mode are presented.  \n \nSelecting relevant energy and passenger mobility data, as well as decid ing which assumptions \n\nshould be considered and which assumptions should be ignored, can be viewed as an \nimprecise exercise. In fact, it should be emphasized that for purposes of this dissertation all \n\nassumptions and considerations are done in a way that allows discovering potential energy \nconsumptions as well as potential CO2 emissions, and not to discover exact energy \nconsumption neither exact CO2 emissions. It is not  the objective to provide exact values for \n\neach parameter but to discover potential values for each parameter of each defined transport \ncategory. \n\nBesides the fact that all used data is referenced, some assumptions and considerations are done \nunder the mindset that \u201cmight represent\u201d or \u201eby common understanding\u201d.  \n \n\n \nPresentation of results \n\nIn this chapter the intermediate calculated results for each sub-mode of transport, specifically \nthe well- to-wheel energy and CO2 percentage distribution are presented. The used format for \nresult presentation will be the as presented in Figure 27.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 27 \u2013 [Methodol ogy] Example  of results presentation.  \n\n \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n64 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nAs an example, here is presented the calculated well-to-wheel CO2 distribution of the normal-\n\nspeed rail segment, both for passenger mobility and freight transport.  \n \n\nThe inner ring refers to the percentage CO2 distribution of the used energy carriers. In the case, \n32% refer to the well- to-wheel CO2 emissions from diesel, and 68% refer to the well- to-wheel \nCO2 emissions from electricity.  \n\nThe second ring refers to the CO2 distribution but separating the well- to-tank and tank-to-\nwheel. For example, it is possible to conclude that the well- to-tank CO2 emissions from \n\nnormal-speed diesel correspond to about 5% of the total well- to-wheel CO2 emissions of the \nnormal-speed segment. Also, it is possible to see that the electricity CO2 emissions respect \nonly to the tank-to-wheel basis, being 68% of the total normal-speed well-to-wheel CO2 \n\nemissions. \n \n\n \n\n4.1. Air transport sector \n \n\n4.1.1. Overview of available and required data \n \n\nTable 62 on the Annexes presents the Eurostat available data and the required data ( in gray) for \npurposes of this dissertation. Generally speaking, due the assumptions taken on this \n\ndissertation, the detail level of the Eurostat data is enough.  \nThe Eurostat provides the total energy and CO2 tank-to-wheel quantities, the total demand for \npassenger mobility and freight transport, but does not make any energy and CO2 \n\ndifferentiation between passenger of freight purpose, or by energy type. It also does not \npresent any data on the well- to-tank energy consumption and CO2 emissions. \n \n\n \n\nEnergy data \n\nThe energy data provided by the Eurostat for 2007 shows the almost entirely reliance of the air \nsector on kerosene (99,7% [11]), with a small amount of gasoline (0,3% [11]). For purposes of \nthis dissertation, it was not required to deeply study the air sector in all of its used energy \n\ntypes, and therefore, for purposes of discovering potential energy and CO2 impacts, it was \nassumed that the air sector relies entirely on kerosene, with the remaining gasoline energy data \n\nbeing added to the kerosene energy data. Table 13 shows the data. \n \n\nTable 13 \u2013 [Air] Eur ostat energ y data [11]. \n\nPJ  \n\nGasoline 7 \n\nKerosene 2.230 \n\n \n\n \nAs a limitation of the reporting statistics methodology, the kerosene data provided by the \nEurostat corresponds to the fuel sold at the airport and does not make any differentiation to \n\nwhere this airplane is flying to. It can fly within the national member state level (domestic \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  65 \n\n \n\nflights), from one member state into another ( intra-EU flights), or from one member state to \n\nother continent (intercontinental flights). Therefore, it is not possible to directly use the \nkerosene data from the Eurostat, as for purposes of this dissertation, the objective was to study \n\nthe EU situation (domestic and intra-EU level). \nCO2 data \nRegarding the CO2 emissions data, the Eurostat provides a first differentiation between \n\n\u201cdomestic\u201d and \u201cinternational flights\u201d, where \u201cinternational flights\u201d includes both the \u201cintra-\nEU\u201d and the \u201cintercontinental\u201d flights. Again, in order to have a total EU picture, \u201cdomestic\u201d \n\nand \u201cintra-EU\u201d flights should be considered together.  \n \n \n\nPassenger mobility data \nRegarding the passenger mobility data, the Eurostat provides a unique value for the entire air \n\nsector. According to the definition [11], this value includes both \u201cdomestic\u201d and \u201cintra-EU\u201d \nflights, which is the exact situation that is required for purposes of this dissertation. This value \ncan be already introduced on both energy and CO2 tables, as showed in Figure 28. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 28 \u2013 [Air] P assenger mobility i nput. \n\n \n \n\nData overview \nTable 14 summarizes the available data on the Eurostat in function of its regional scope.  \n \n\nTable 14 \u2013 [Air] Eur ostat scope  data [11]. \n\n Domestic  Intra-EU  Extra-EU \n\nEnergy 2.236PJ \n\nCO2 22MtCO2  137MtCO2 \n\nPassenger mobility 572bpkm  No data \n\n \n \n\nTable 14 shows that only the passenger mobility data respects the scope required for purposes \nof this dissertation, being all the other data distributed through different scopes. Therefore \nthere is the need to calculate both the energy and CO2 data according to the same regional \n\nscope. \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n66 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n4.1.2.

Finding the total tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 quantities \n \n\n \nFigure 29 \u2013 [Air] Fi nd the TTW total e nergy and CO2.  \n\n \n\n \nOn the impossibility of directly using the e nergy and CO2 data from the Eurostat, it was \n\ndecided to contact DGENER and DGMOVE in order to have EU27 pictures for energy, CO2 \nand passenger mobility data. Only DGMOVE replied to the sent questions [27], providing \nuseful information on the passenger mobility split between domestic and Intra-EU flights. The \n\ninformation is shown on Table 15: \n \n\nTable 15 \u2013 [Air] Output fr om DGMOVE e mail exc hange. \n\nEurostat Domestic Intra-EU \n\n572bpkm 117bpkm 455bpkm \n\n \n\n \nBy having the domestic situation both on CO2 emissions (22MtCO2) and passenger mobility \n\n(117bpkm), it was possible to create a first picture of CO2 efficiency in terms of gCO2/pkm, \nfor domestic flights. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nThere are some studies saying that the CO2 efficiency for intra-EU flights is around \n140gCO2/pkm [28, 29], while other study by the European Commission shows a value of \n\n200gCO2/pkm [30]. As additional information, Lufthansa says that in 2007 their average tank-\nto-wheel CO2 efficiency was 109gCO2/pkm [31]. \n\n \nHaving this variety of data, it was decided to use t he calculated value of 190gCO2/pkm, as it \nrepresents the result of using the data provided by the Eurostat, having in mind that other \n\nstudies provide different values.  This value can already be introduced on the CO2 efficiency \ntable, as shown in Figure 30. \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  67 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 30 \u2013 [Air] TTW  CO2 per pk m input. \n\n \n\n \nMultiplying the Eurostat passenger mobility data (572bpkm), by the calculated CO2 efficiency \n\nfactor (190gCO2/pkm), it is possible to obtain the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions for the EU27 \npicture. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nThis value can already be introduced on the Total CO2 table, as showed in Figure 31. \n \n\n \nFigure 31 \u2013 [Air] TTW  total CO2 input. \n\n \n\n \nHaving the total quantity of the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions, it is possible to calculate the \n\nrespective total quantity of tank-to-wheel energy, through the usage of a conversion factor [12].  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nThis value can already be introduced on the Total Energy table as showed in Figure 32. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 32 \u2013 [Air] TTW  total energ y input. \n\n \n \n\nDividing this value by the passenger mobility data, it is possible to calculate the tank-to-wheel \n\nenergy efficiency in terms of MJ/pkm.  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n68 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nThis value can already be introduced on the Energy efficiency table as showed in Figure 33. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 33 \u2013 [Air] TTW  energy per pk m i nput. \n\n \nAfter the calculation of the tank-to-wheel average energy efficiency, both in terms of \n\ngCO2/pkm and MJ/pkm, it is now objective to calculate the same figures but in terms of \ngCO2/km and MJ/km. This calculation requires the input of data on occupancy rate as showed \nin Figure 34. \n\n  \n2. Finding the occupancy rate \n\n \n\n \nFigure 34 \u2013 [Air] Fi nd the occupancy rate.  \n\n \n \n\nThe data on occupancy rate needed for purposes of this dissertation is the average number of \npassengers per airplane (passengers/airplane). In this dissertation, this value was obtained via \nthe multiplication between the average seat capacity of the EU?s airplanes (seats/airplane) and \n\nthe average load factor in percentage terms % (passengers/seats) \n \n\nThe Eurocontrol, the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation, published in \ntheir report from 2008 that the average seat capacity of the European airplanes on 2008 was of \n137 passengers per airplane  [32]. This figure cannot be directly compared with the publication \n\nfrom the Statistical Pocketbook of the European Commission, once it indicates only the \nnumber of airplanes ranging between the 51-150 and the 151-250 seats per airplane [11]. \nHowever and for purposes of this dissertation, it was decided to use the data from the \n\nEurocontrol as it gives an exact number being unnecessary the introduction of any additional \nassumptions. \n\n \nHaving the average seat capacity of the EU?s airplanes, it is now required to find the average \nload factor of the EU?s airplanes, in terms of percentage (%). Here, the Association of \n\nEuropean Airlines (AEA) provides data on the load factor of passenger airplanes on their \nannual reports, being of 77% for the year o f 2007 [33]. As additional information, this figure \n\nis also referred by the European Energy Agency o n its annual \u201cOccupancy rate of passenger \nvehicles\u201d report [34].. \n \n\nHaving these two values it is possible to calculate the EU?s average number of passengers per \nairplane. \n\n \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  69 \n\n \n\nThis value can already be introduced on the Energy and CO2 tables as showed in Figure 35. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 35 \u2013 [Air] Occupanc y r ate  input. \n\n \n \n\n3.

Rail transport sector \n \nFor purposes of this dissertation, it the objective was to analyse and comprehend how diesel \n\nand electricity is currently being consumed for rail passenger mobility purposes, as well as the \nimportance of each sub- mode for the total well- to-wheel energy and CO2 picture. \n \n\nIt is not the objective of this dissertation to determine the differences on energy consumption \ndue the air conditioning, lightning, services, etc, or due the technical efficiency systems \n\ncontributions such as the energy recovery breaking system, improvements on the pantographs \netc, but to provide information of what is actually being directly consumed by the rail sector \nfrom the electricity network or from the diesel tank.  \n\n \n \n\n4.2.1. Overview of available and required data \n \n\nTable 63 of the Annexes presents the Eurostat available data and the required data (gray) for \npurposes of this dissertation. Generally speaking, due the assumptions taken on this \ndissertation, the detail level of the Eurostat is not enough.  Similarly to the air sector, also on \n\nthe rail sector the Eurostat does not provide any well-to-tank energy and CO2 informatio n.  \n \n\nAs an example, the Eurostat does not pro vide the energy and CO2 data for the metro segment \nbut provides its passenger mobility demand. It is a different detail level from the Eurostat, \nwhich provides the passenger mobility and freight transport demand information by sub- mode, \n\nbut does not make any differentiation between energy and CO2 emissions.  \nThe electricity and diesel information corresponds therefore for all rail sectors.  \n \n\n \n\nEnergy data \n\nTable 16 resumes the energy data provided by the Eurostat which shows that the rail sector \nrelies on about 34% on diesel, with the remaining 66% on electricity.  \n \n\nTable 16 \u2013 [Rail] Eurostat energy data [11]. \n\nPJ  \n\nDiesel 132 \n\nElectricity 254 \n\n \n \n\nCO2 data \nRegarding the CO2 emissions data, the Eurostat definition explains that the associated \nelectricity emissions are not included in the Eurostat rail CO2 data, being only considered the  \n\nemissions coming from the combustion of fossil fuels (diesel and solid fuels). For the year of \n2007, the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions were about 8,2Mt [11]. \n\n \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n76 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nRail statistics \n\nRegarding the passenger mobility data, the Eurostat provides a first differentiation between the \nconsidered sub-modes of rail transport. It separates on metro/tram, normal- and high-speed rail, \n\nbeing a very good level of detail for purposes of this dissertation. However, it does not make \ndifferentiation between energy types.  \nOn the freight transport side the Eurostat provides an agglomerate value for all rail sector. It \n\nwas assumed in this dissertation that this figure refers only to the normal-speed sub- mode. \nTable 17 shows the passenger mobility and freight transport data: \n\n \nTable 17 \u2013 [Rail] Eurostat tr ans por t statistics  [11]. \n\n Passenger Freight \n\nMetro 86bpkm \n\n453btkm Railways (Normal-speed rail) 395bpkm \n\nHigh-speed 89bpkm \n\n \n \n\nOnce the scope is not relevant on the rail sector (no intercontinental rail trips), it is already \npossible to introduce all three values on the rail table, on the Average rows, as showed in \nFigure 50. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 50 \u2013 [Rail] P assenger mobility input. \n\n \n \n\n4.2.2. Overview and accuracy of Ex-Tremis data \n  \n\nAs explained in the C hapter State of Art, the Ex-Tremis model provides the separation \nbetween the energy needed for passenger mobility and for freight transport purposes, and also \nby energy type: diesel and electricity.  \n\nFigure 51 provides an overview of the energy data provided by the Ex-Tremis model for the \nyear 2007. The \u201chst\u201d means high-speed train, \u201cloc\u201d locomotive and \u201crca\u201d railcar.  \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  77 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 51 \u2013 [Rail] Ex-Tre mis 2007 details. \n\n \n \n\nThe Ex-Tremis model provides energy data by purposes of passenger mobility and freight \ntransport, and also individually prese nts the value for high-speed trains. For purposes of this \n\ndissertation, the objective was not to study the energy consumption by vehic le type \n(locomotive or railcar), but to have a conglomerated value.  \n \n\nA first comparison with the energy data from the Eurostat was made as showed in Table 18. \n \n\nTable 18 \u2013 [Rail] Comparison between Eurostat and Ex-Tre mis. \n\nPJ Eurostat* Ex-Tremis Variation [%] \n\nDiesel 132 114 -14 % \n\nElectricity 255 173 -32 % \n\nTotal 386 287 -25 % \n\n \n\n \nThe energy data coming from the Ex-Tremis is about 25% lower than the presented by the  \nEurostat. Knowing that the Eurostat was an input data on the Ex-Tremis model, as described \n\non its report [16], this difference can be considered as inconsistent and out of range. On the \ndiesel side, the 14% difference could be well accepted as it does not represent such a big error, \n\nbut in the case of electricity, a difference of 32% was considered also as out of range.  \n \nHaving these differences on the energy quantities, it was decided to calculate the relative \n\nweight (in terms of %) of each energy type on the Ex-Tremis mode. Figure 52 shows the \nrelative weights of each energy type by purpose, related to the total Rail energy presented in \n\nthe Ex-Tremis model: \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n78 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 52 \u2013 [Rail] Rel ati ve  energy weights on Ex-Tre mis. \n\n \n\n \nThe relative weights are presented on the right column and shows, for example, that the high-\n\nspeed trains represented about 0,1% of the total energy for the rail sector, or 0,2% of the total \nelectricity for rail. Also, it is possible to sum all the values regarding the passenger transport  \n(pass_train), and conclude that 64,1% of the energy for the rail sector goes for passenger \n\nmobility purposes, and the remaining for freight transport.  \n \n\nHaving this variety of information, it was decided to calculate the relative energy weight of the \npassenger mobility and freight transport by energy type, and also the role of the high-speed \nrail. \n\nTable 19 and Table 20 show the relative weight of interest for purposes of this dissertation: \n \n\nTable 19 \u2013 [Rail] Resume of rele vant energy weights.  \n\n % Total Rail % Total Diesel % Total Electricity \n\nDiesel 60,3% n.a. n.a. \n\nElectricity 39,7% n.a. n.a. \n\nHigh-speed train 0,1% 0% 0,2% \n\n \n\n \nTable 20 \u2013 [Rail] Resume of rele vant passenger mobility and freight tr ans por t weights. \n\n % Total Rail % Total Diesel % Total Electricity \n\nPassenger mobility 64,1% 56,0% 69,3% \n\nFreight transport 35,9% 44,0% 30,7% \n\n \n\n \nThese results were considered as a good contribution for purposes of this dissertation.

It was decided to \ncalculate its tank-to-wheel energy efficiency in terms of MJ/km, and test if it is in line with \n\nsome published values for tank-to-wheel energy consumption of high-speed trains. \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n80 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nBy applying the high-speed train relative weight (0,2%) to the total tank-to-wheel rail \n\nelectricity (254PJ) it was possible to build a total tank-to-wheel energy picture for the high-\nspeed rail sub- mode. The following equation shows the calculation: \n\n  \n\n \n\n \nThis value would correspond to the total tank-to-wheel electricity consumed by the high-speed \n\nrail sector within the EU, in 2007. Using the passenger mobility data from the Eurostat \n(89bpkm), a first figure is obtained in terms of MJ/pkm: \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nThis figure was viewed as a relatively lower value of energy consumpt ion for the high-speed \ntrains. A study published by the \u201cInstitut national de recherch\u00e9 sur les transports et leur \n\nsecurite\u201d (IN RETS) [35], provides several characteristics of the main high-speed rail services \noperating within the EU.  \n\nTable 22 summarizes the relevant characteristics collected from the INRETS, for purposes of \nthis dissertation: \n \n\nTable 22 \u2013 [High-spee d] INRETS details for high-spee d ser vices [35]. \n\n MJ/vehicle.km Seats/vehicle \nTypical \n\noccupied seats \nLoad factor \n\nTGV Duplex 64,8 545 436 80,0% \n\nICE 1\nst\n gen 86,7 645 290 45,0% \n\nTGV Paris Sud-est 63,7 368 294 79,9% \n\nAVE Madrid-Sevilla 57,2 313 266 85,0% \n\nAVERAGE 68,1 468 322 68,7% \n\n \n\n \nIt is possible to conclude that the average tank-to-wheel energy consumption per km was \n\nabout 68,1MJ/km, with an average occupancy rate of 322passengers/vehicle. \n \nHaving these values, it was possible to compare the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency coming \n\nfrom the INRETS study (68,1MJ/km), with the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency calculated \nfrom Ex-Tremis and Eurostat (0,005MJ/pkm).  \n\nOnce the values are different (one in MJ/km and other in MJ/pkm), it was necessary to use the \noccupancy rate to convert one of them. The following equation shows the calculation of the \ntank-to-wheel energy efficiency per km using the value of Ex-Tremis: \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  81 \n\n \n\nThe figure of 1,72MJ/km should present the same order of magnitude as the 68,1MJ/km \n\ncoming from the IN RETS study, b ut it does not. It was not the objective of this dissertation to \njustify this difference, but it might be possible that the energy database of the Ex-Tremis is \n\nrelatively older and did not took into account the recent expansion of the high-speed lines in \ncountries such as Germany, Spain or The Netherlands, which would increase the total energy \nconsumption by the high speed train segment (hst).  \n\n \nFor solving this problem, it was decided to realise the opposite exercise. Instead of starting \n\nwith the total energy consumed by the high-speed rail, it was first assumed an average tank-to-\nwheel energy efficiency in terms of MJ/km coming from the INRETS study, and then \ncalculate the total tank-to-wheel energy consumption of the high-speed rail sector.  \n\n \n \n\n4.2.3. The calculation flow: high-speed rail \n \nHere, and with no additional information coming from the INRETS study, it was assumed that \n\nthe tank-to-wheel energy efficiency of 68,1MJ/km was the real consumption of the high-speed \ntrain, and not the energy consumed directly from the network. This doubt came up because of \n\nthe definition of the electricity energy data provided by the Eurostat, which regards to the \nelectricity delivered on the electricity network. Therefore, the energy losses at the catenaries \nshould be quantified.  \n\nFor information, this consideration will not provide such important results or contributions for \nthe total well-to-wheel energy and CO2 transport picture, but as a question of concept \n\ndefinition, it was decided to evaluate these energy losses.  \n \nAccording to a report published by the \u201cEuropean Copper Institute\u201d, the average percentage of \n\nenergy losses in the catenaries wires can amount to 10% [36] of the transferred electricity \n(90% efficiency). This figure regards specifically to the Dutch railway system but, for \n\npurposes of this dissertation, it was assumed to be the same as the European average. \n \n\n \nFigure 54 \u2013 [High-spee d] High-s pee d c ate nar y e fficiency.  \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n82 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nThe following equation shows the calculation of the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency at the \n\nelectricity network, considering the catenary losses. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nThis value can be already introduced on the energy efficiency table, together with the \noccupancy rate. Having these figures, it is now possible to calculate tank-to-wheel energy \n\nefficiency per pkm for the high-speed sector, through the division by the occupancy rate.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nIt was obtained a value of 0,24MJ/pkm as average tank-to-wheel energy efficiency of the \nhigh-speed rail sector. According to several studies  [30] [22] [37], this value is in the range for \n\nthe high-speed rail sector. Table 23 presents the collection of values published in some studies \non the same topic: \n \n\nTable 23 \u2013 [High-spee d] Comparison of TTW energ y efficiency. \n\nMJ/pkm  \n\nValue of this dissertation 0,24 \n\n [30](100%, 25% Occp.

So, it was decided to proceed with the va lue of \n0,24MJ/pkm and introduce it on the energy efficiency table. \n\nFigure 55 shows the introduction of the already obtained values for the high-speed rail \nsegment. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 55 \u2013 [High-spee d] Initi al values  input. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  83 \n\n \n\nThe calculation of the total tank-to-wheel energy consumption comes as a multiplication \n\nbetween the average energy efficiency in terms of MJ/pkm and the passenger mobility data \nprovided by the Eurostat.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nThis means that in 2007, the high-speed rail sector operating within the EU consumed about \n21PJ of energy. Figure 56 shows the introduction.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 56 \u2013 [High-spee d] TTW total e nergy input. \n\n \n\n \n1. Finding the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel factors per km and per pkm \n\n \nAs previously described, the well-to-tank electricity value refers to the total primary energy \nneeded at the power plant to deliver the electricity on the network, ensuring the tank-to-wheel \n\nenergy consumption by the vehicle in question (electric train or other).  \nUsing the values previously obtained for the T&amp;D losses (92% [25]) and the EU?s electricity \n\nproduction efficiency (48% [26]), the calculation of the well- to-tank energy efficiency in \nterms of MJ/km comes as: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nThe calculation of the well-to-wheel comes as the sum of the well- to-tank and tank-to-wheel: \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nThe final step needed to evaluate the total well-to-tank and well- to-wheel energy quantities for \n\nthe high-speed rail sector, is the calculation of the well- to-tank and well- to-wheel energy \nefficiency in terms of MJ/pkm.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n84 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nThe four previously calculated values should be introduced on the energy table as showed in \nFigure 57. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 57 \u2013 [High-spee d] W TT and W TW  energy efficienc y input. \n\n \n\n \n2. Finding the total well-to-tank and well-to-wheel energy quantities \n\n \nFinally, it can be calculated the well-to-tank and well- to-wheel total energy consumption: \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nAnd their respective introduction on the Total energy table, as showed in Figure 58. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 58 \u2013 [High-spee d] W TT and W TW  total energ y input. \n\n \n\n \n3. Finding the CO2 emissions \n\n \nAs described before, were considered zero the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions from the usage of \nelectricity as energy carrier for transport. Therefore, the only CO2 emissions correspond only \n\nto the production at the power plant. Here, the calculation of the CO2 emissions relies on the \nmultiplication between the tank-to-wheel energy consumption (MJ/km) at the power plant  \n\nlevel and the CO2 factor of 115gCO2/MJ.  \n \nThe tank-to-wheel efficiency at the power plant takes into account the T&amp;D losses (92% [25]): \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  85 \n\n \n\nThe 82MJ/km corresponds to the well- to-tank energy consumption of the high-speed train at \n\nthe power plant level. By applying the 115gCO2/MJ factor, it is possible to obtain the \nassociated CO2 emissions: \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nAnd the associated CO2 efficiency per pkm: \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nTable 24 shows that the value of 29gCO2/pkm for the high-speed rail is in line with the study  \n[38]. Therefore, it was decided to continue with the calculated values and introduce them on \n\nthe CO2 efficiency table.  \n \n\nTable 24 \u2013 [High-spee d] Comparison of CO2 efficienc y.  \n\ngCO2/pkm  \n\nValue of this dissertation 29 (69% load factor) \n\n[38] 30 (70% load factor) \n\n \n \n\nVia these results, it is possible to calculate the total CO2 emissions for the high-speed rail \nthrough the multiplication between the gCO2/pkm factors and the  Eurostat passenger mobility \n\n(bpkm). The value can already be introduced on the Total CO2 table. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nHence the high-speed rail sector operating in the EU in the year of 2007 emitted about 3 Mt of \n\nCO2 for the production of about 21PJ for final consumption, which corresponds to 47PJ of \nprimary energy needs. Figure 59 shows the complete CO2 table.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 59 \u2013 [High-spee d] Re maining CO2 de tails  input. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n86 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

The calculation flow: metro &amp; tram \n \nHaving no additional data on the Ex-Tremis model for the metro or the normal-speed tank-to-\n\nwheel energy consumption, it was decided to realise the same procedure as for high-speed rail: \nfirst input a value of tank-to-wheel energy consumption in terms of MJ/km, then find the \noccupancy rate and finally calculate the total energy quantities. \n\n \n \n\n1.

First it was assumed an average capacity of the European metro ways and secondly the \naverage load factor. \nAccording to the used source, the average seat capacity of t he metro ways should be increased \n\nby 30%, as an additional contribution representing the standing places. Table 26 shows the \ndata used for the calculation: \n\n \nTable 26 \u2013 [Metr o] Values on seat c apacity. \n\nSeats/vehicle  \n\nAverage seat capacity 260%30200200  [41] \n\nTypical load factor 35% [34] \n\n \n\nWith the previous values, it is possible to calculate the average occupancy rate: \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nThis means that about 91 persons are travelling per metro at the EU level, in an average for the \nyear of 2007, all days. It is not the objective to study peak or non-peak hours, as well as week \n\nor weekend days, or differences according to the city, but to have an annual average European \nvalue. \n \n\n3. Finding the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm \n \n\nWith the previous figure, it is possible to calculate the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency in \nterms of MJ/pkm. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFinally, Table 27 compares and resumes the collected values: \n \n\nTable 27 \u2013 [Metr o] Comparison of TTW energ y efficiency. \n\nMJ/pkm  \n\nValue of this dissertation 0,14MJ/pkm \n\n[39] 0,48MJ/pkm \n\n[40] 0,54MJ/pkm \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  89 \n\n \n\nThe value of 0,14MJ/pkm is out of order when compared to the values from the other reports. \n\nGiven that the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per km was in line with the same sources, the \nonly problem resides on the occupancy rate.  \n\nTo understand the problem, it was decided to calculate which should be the average \noccupancy rate if the past values would be representative of the real situation.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nThis value would correspond to about 10% of load factor, if the average seat capacity of metro \nlines in the EU would be as 260. Or, in the other way around, given the 35% load capacity \nprovided by the European Energy Agency, this would result on an average seat capacity of 76 \n\nseats per vehicle. \nThus, it was necessary to decide between the 260 average seat capacity or the 35% load factor \n\ncoming from the European Energy Agency.  Here, it was decided to keep the value of 35% for \nthe load factor and adapt the occupancy rate to 26passengers/vehicle. \n \n\nAs additional information, a study conducted by the agency PriceWaterHouseCoopers to the \nEuropean Commission advances an average value of 20passengers/vehicle for light rails, \n\nwhich could represent the short distance rail services such as metro or tramways [42]. \nHowever, it is not mentioned within the report if metro is included on this category. \n \n\nAdditionally, it might be that the 260 average seat capacity provided by the other study was an \nextreme value or a specific value of a dedicated metro brand analysed, or with a specific \n\nnumber of cars however, it is not clear on the report the adopted scope.  \n \nHaving decided which values are going to be used on this dissertation, they can already be \n\nintroduced on the energy table, as showed in Figure 62. \n \n\n \nFigure 62 \u2013 [Metr o] Initi al values  input. \n\n \n \n\n4. Finding the total tank-to-wheel energy quantity \n \nHaving achieved a consistency between sources on the values for tank-to-wheel energy \n\nconsumption per km, per pkm and the occupancy rate, it can be now applied the passenger \nmobility data from the Eurostat (86bpkm) and obtain the total tank-to-wheel electricity \n\nconsumption for the metro&amp;tram sector. \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n90 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nThis means that all the metro and tram services operating in the European Union in 2007 \nconsumed about 43PJ of electric ity as final energy consumption, as showed in Figure 63. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 63 \u2013 [Metr o] TTW total e nergy input. \n\n \n\n \n5. Finding the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel energy efficiency factors \n\n \nSimilarly as previously realised for the high-speed rail sector, the same methodology is \napplied to find the well-to-tank energy efficiency, both in terms of energy per km and per pkm, \n\nand finally the calculation of the total well-to-tank and well- to-wheel energy consumption.  \nThe well-to-tank energy efficiency in terms of MJ/km comes as: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nThe well-to-wheel energy efficiency in terms of MJ/km comes as: \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nThe similar values but in terms of MJ/pkm: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  91 \n\n \n\nThese values should now be introduced on the ener gy table as showed in Figure 64. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 64 \u2013 [Metr o] W TT and W TW  energy efficienc y input. \n\n \n\n \n6. Finding the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel total energy quantities \n\n \nOnce calculated the well- to-tank and well-to-wheel energy efficiencies per pkm, the \ncalculation of the total quantities comes as: \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nAnd their respective introduction on the energy table as showed in Figure 65.  \n \n\n \nFigure 65 \u2013 [Metr o] W TT and W TW  total energ y input. \n\n \n \n\n7. Finding the CO2 efficiency factors per km and per pkm \n \nSimilarly to the methodology used to the high-speed rail, the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions \n\nwere considered as zero for electricity as energy carrier. The emissions regards only to the \nrespective electricity production at the power plant level. Here, the calculation should take into \n\naccount the T&amp;D losses (92% [36]): \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nAnd the respective CO2 emission factor per km: \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n92 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nHaving this, it is possible to find the well-to-wheel CO2 efficiency factor per km.

Finding the total well-to-tank and well-to-wheel CO2 quantities \n\n \n\nUsing the previous calculated values, the calculation for the total well- to-tank and well-to-\nwheels CO2 emissions provide the final CO2 quantities. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure 67 \u2013 [Metr o] W TW e nergy distri bution.  \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  93 \n\n \n\nThe inner ring shows that the metro segment relies entirely on one energy carrier: electricity. \n\nThe well- to-wheel distribution is about 69% for the well- to-tank and the remaining 31% for \nthe tank-to-wheel. \n\n \nFigure 68 \u2013 [Metr o] W TW CO2 distributi on. \n\n \nThe inner ring shows that the metro CO2 emissions come only from the usage of electricity as \n\nenergy carrier. O nce it was considered the tank-to-wheel emission as zero, the chart confirms  \nthe 100% CO2 emissions coming only from the well- to-tank basis. \n \n\n \n\n4.2.5. The calculation flow: normal-speed rail \n \nAs explained before, it was assumed on this dissertation that the normal-speed rail only \nconsumes energy in forms of diesel and electricity, and is both used for passenger mobility \n\nand freight transport purposes.  \nAs calculated before, Table 28 shows the obtained results for total diesel and electricity \n\nconsumed for passenger mobility and freight transport purposes. \n \n\nTable 28 \u2013 [Nor mal-s pee d] Data fr om Ex-Tre mis and Eur ostat.  \n\n Result \n\nDiesel for passenger mobility PJPJ 74132%56  \n\nDiesel for freight transport PJPJPJ 5874132  \n\nElectricity for passenger mobility PJPJ 176254%69  \n\nElectricity for freight transport PJPJPJ 78176254  \n\nEnergy for passenger mobility PJPJPJ 25017674  \n\nEnergy for freight transport PJPJPJ 1367858  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n94 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n1. Finding the total tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 quantities \n\n \n\n \nFigure 69 \u2013 [Nor mal-s pee d] Find the TTW  total energy and CO2.  \n\n \nIt was assumed on this dissertation that the electricity for passenger mobility was consumed by \nthe rail sub- modes of metro&amp;tram, normal-speed and high-speed, while in the case of diesel \n\nfor passenger mobility, it was considered to be consumed only by the normal-speed rail \nsegment. \n\n \nHaving these values, it was not necessary to first find the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency in \nterms of energy per km or per pkm, since the total tank-to-wheel energy quantities have been \n\npreviously calculated.  \nIt was directly possible to introduce the value of diesel for passenger mobility (74PJ) and the \n\nrespective CO2 emissions (5MtCO2) both on the energy and CO2 tables. Figure 70 and Figure \n71 show the introduction.  \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 70 \u2013 [Nor mal-s pee d] TTW  total diesel energy input. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 71 \u2013 [Nor mal-s pee d] TTW  total diesel CO2 input. \n\n \n \n\nIn the case of electricity for the normal-speed rail segment, it was not needed to introduce any \nadditional external data source. Since the values for total tank-to-wheel electricity for metro \nand high-speed rail was calculated before, the calculation of the normal-speed is the remaining \n\nvalue. \n \n\nIn this case, the calculation relies only on the subtraction to the total rail electricity for \npassenger mobility (176PJ), the metro&amp;tram (43PJ) and the high-speed (21PJ). The following \nequation shows the calculation: \n\n \n  \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  95 \n\n \n\nThis value would correspond to the total tank-to-wheel electricity consumption by the normal-\n\nspeed segment in 2007, and can already be introduced on the energy table as showed in Figure \n72. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 72 \u2013 [Nor mal-s pee d] TTW  total energy input. \n\n \n\n \n2. Finding the passenger mobility by energy type \n\n \nDifferently from the previous rail sub- modes of metro and high-speed rail, the normal-speed \nsector relies on two energy carriers: diesel and electricity. Hence, t he Eurostat data indicates \n\nthat the total passenger mobility travelling by normal-speed rail is 395bpkm, but does not \nmake any differentiation between the passenger-km travelling on diesel from those travelling \n\non electric trains. \n \nThe Ex-Tremis data was useful in the sense that it provides detailed differentiation by energy \n\ntype consumed for passenger mobility purposes, but does not make differentiation on the \namount of passengers-km travelling on diesel or on electricity. Here, the relation cannot be \n\nconsidered as directly proportional due the different energy efficiencies associated to the \nengines of each train: diesel trains are moved with an internal combustion engine, while \nelectric drive trains with an on-board electricity transformer.  \n\nThis concept definition of the different engine drive efficiencies, anticipates the conclusion \nthat diesel trains are expected to be more energy intensive per passenger-km when compared \nto the electric trains.  \n\n \nAs previously described on the Chapter State of Art, the Tremove model regards specifically \n\nto the road fleet composition but also provides interesting details for the rail sector. In the rail \nsector, it shows the amount of passengers-km travelling on diesel and electric trains.  \nFor purposes of this dissertation, 2007 data is required. Although it will not bring such a big \n\nimpact on the total picture, it was realised an interpolation between the years of 2005 and 2010 \nto find the 2007 data. Figure 73 shows the data provided by the Tremove for the rail sector: \n\n \n\n \nFigure 73 \u2013 [Nor mal-s pee d] Tre move r ail passenger mobility data . \n\n \n \nAs a brief note, the interpolation can be considered as a reliable methodology to find the 2007  \n\ndata once the Tremove does not model any extreme scenario, like a very high value happening \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n96 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\non 2007. Tremove?s predictions assume a linearity increase throughout the years and so \n\napplying an interpolation provides a value in line with that increase. \nA first comparison with the Eurostat data was realised on Table 29. \n\n \nTable 29 \u2013 [Nor mal-s pee d] Comparison between Eur ostat and Tre move.  \n\nbpkm Eurostat Tremove Variation % \n\nDiesel Non available 54 n.a. \n\nElectricity Non available 336 n.a. \n\nRail (normal and high-speed) 484 390 -19% \n\nMetro 86 55 -37% \n\n \n\n \nThe Tremove model does not make any differentiation between normal- and high-speed rail \n\nbut provides a differentiation on metro. It is not the objective of this dissertation to explain the \ndifferences between these two values, but it might be that as the Tremove was developed in \nthe past years (about 1995), and did not include  some metro and high-speed lines that recently \n\nappeared. Therefore it appears a 37% differences in the amount of passengers-km on metro, \nand about 20% of the normal- and high-speed rail together.  \n\nIn this case it was decided to not use directly the data from the Tremove, but to use the relative \nweights (%) and apply them to the Eurostat data.  \nFrom the interpolated 2007 data, it was possible to calculate the ratio between the passengers-\n\nkm travelling on electricity on the total passengers-km on all passengers by train.  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nHere, and to respect coherence on the methodology, it should be clarified that this ratio cannot \n\nbe directly applied to the value of the Eurostat (395bpkm), as the methodology behind in the \nTremove includes the high-speed lines at that time.  \n\n \nFor contouring this problem, an equation system was realised. It was considered that the 86% \nratio of electricity-pkm includes both the normal-speed and the high-speed Eurostat values \n\n(395 and 89bpkm). Again, this calculation will not bring additional or important variations on \nthe total values of passengers-km, but to respect concept definition, it was decided to account \n\nfor this difference.  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  97 \n\n \n\nWith this equation it was found that about 328bpkm are currently travelling on normal-speed \n\nrunning on electricity. In what regards to the diesel passengers-km: \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \nThese values should now be introduced on both the energy and CO2 tables, as showed in \n\nFigure 74. \n \n\n \nFigure 74 \u2013 [Nor mal-s pee d] P assenger mobility by energy type input. \n\n \n \n\n3. Finding the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm \n\n \nHaving the passengers-km and the total tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 values, the respective \n\ntank-to-wheel energy efficiency in terms of MJ/pkm and gCO2/pkm can be now calculated. \nThe following equations show the calculation: \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nAnd the average normal-speed rail tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm, including both \n\ndiesel and electricity: \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nRegarding the sources, within the literature it was not found values specifically for diesel \ntrains in terms of MJ per pkm but only for electric trains, or also as average (diesel and \nelectricity combined). Table 30 shows a comparison of the found values: \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n98 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nTable 30 \u2013 [Nor mal-s pee d] Comparison of TTW  energy e fficiency. \n\nMJ/pkm  \n\nValue of this dissertation \u2013 diesel 1,10 \n\nValue of this dissertation \u2013 electricity 0,34 \n\nValue of this dissertation - average 0,47 \n\n[30] [0,29 \u2013 1,14] \n\n[37] (average electric train) 0,29 \n\n[37] (new electric train) 0,31 \n\n[37] (old electric train) 0,43 \n\n[39] (average) 0,96 \n\n \n \nIn terms of energy per passenger-km, the energy efficiency calculated on this dissertation for \n\nelectric trains is in line with the published sources, being an intermediate value between new \nand old electric trains. A special remark to the higher value coming from the last study, \n\nshowing an Western European Union value of 0,96MJ/pkm, double of the one calculated on  \nthis dissertation. \nIt can be judged the importance that the occupancy rate might have on these results. In one \n\nhand, if the data is compared with same load factor, in terms of %, does not have sense. The \ndata should be compared on the same basis as the number of passengers per vehicle  \n\n(passengers/vehicle) and not on the load factor in percentage terms. For example, there is a \ndifferent seat capacity between Nordic and Southern trains which influences the load factor in \npercentage terms.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 75 \u2013 [Nor mal-s pee d] TTW  energy per pk m input. \n\n \n\n \n4. Finding the occupancy rate \n\n \nSimilarly as before, finding representative data on the European average number of passengers \nper vehicle on normal-speed rail was not an easy task to perform. Sea rching within the \n\nrepresentative European or International rail associations such as the UNIFE or the UIC, it \nwas not possible to find such data on their annual free reports. \n\n  \nOnce more, the methodology was to find a load factor in terms of %, multiplying it by the \ntypical maximum seat capacity of a normal-speed rail, and calculating the average number of \n\npassengers per vehicle.  \nHence, the European Energy Agency advances a value of 36,6% [34] as an average load factor \n\nof the European Union for the rail sector, being not clear whether this data includes the higher \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  99 \n\n \n\nload factors coming from the high-speed rail sector or not. Also, this value might be the \n\naverage including both electric and diesel trains.  \nHaving these limitations in mind, it was assumed the same load factor value for normal-speed \n\ndiesel and electric trains.  \nTable 31 summarizes the maximum seat capacity from the literature: \n \n\nTable 31 \u2013 [Nor mal-s pee d] External data on maxi mum seat capacity. \n\nSeats/vehicle  \n\n[37] 272 \n 237 \n 168 \n\n 227 \n  \n\n[42] 356 \n 400 \n 180 \n\nAverage 263 \n\n \n\n \nAccording to the operational region or country, the number of wagons, rail operator and also \nday time, the average maximum seat capacity varies from a wide range of number of seats, \n\nnon-counting the standing places on the regional or inter-regional services. For example, it is \nhighly likely to happen that a French or a German train show a much higher seat capacity \ncompared to an Austrian or a Belgium train, as there are differences on the number of \n\npopulation. \n \n\nAn average number of 263seats/vehicle was assumed to be the European average maximal \nseat capacity. At this stage of the dissertation, this figure will determine the tank-to-wheel \nenergy efficiency in terms of MJ/km and gCO2/km.  \n\n \nAccording to the data sources, the calculated average seat capacity applies only to electric \n\ntrains. Here, and similarly to the previously explained load factor (%), it should be informed \nthat no work was done to find the average maximum seat capacity specifically for diesel trains, \nbeing assumed to be the same value. The final value of passengers/vehicle comes as: \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure 76 \u2013 [Nor mal-s pee d] Occ upanc y r ate i nput. \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n100 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n5. Finding the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per km \n\n \nNext step is the calculation of the tank-to-wheel energy efficiencies in terms of MJ/km, for \n\ndiesel, electric and average normal-speed segment. \nThe following equations show the diesel, electric and average energy/km factors:  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nOne of the main concerns that might rise up from comparing these values is that the average \nconsumption for normal-speed trains is lower than for high-speed trains. It can be directly \n\njudged as positive and correct due the higher speeds achieved on the high-speed rail, forced to \novertake the wind drag. Remembering the kinetic energy equation, the energy increases with \n\nthe square of the speed.  \n \nIt should to be clear that these values were obtained under many assumptions, one of them \n\nhaving a large high impact: the occupancy rate. A simple calculation can indicate whether the \norder of magnitude for these tank-to-wheel energy efficiencies is correct or not.  \n\n \nBy multiplying the diesel tank-to-wheel energy efficiency by a factor of 25%, representative \nof the overall combustion efficiency, and the electric tank-to-wheel energy efficiency by 85%, \n\nrepresentative of the overall efficiency of electric trains, it is possible to see that the two \nnecessary energy consumptions are in line with each other: \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nThis calculation, whether the assumptions of 25% and 85% are representative of the average \nEuropean Union or not, indicates that these two values can be judged as reliable on the \n\nnecessary energy needed to move the train.  \n \n\nTable 32 provides a comparison between other studies on the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency \nfor normal-speed trains, in terms of MJ/vehicle.km.  \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  101 \n\n \n\nTable 32 \u2013 [Nor mal-s pee d] Comparison of TTW  energy e fficiency.  \n\nMJ/vehicle.km  \n\nValue of this dissertation 32,9 \n\n[37] 47,9 \n\n(3 cars) 29,9 \n\n 31,5 \n\n 29,4 \n\n 34,2 \n\n(8-cars) 41,4 \n\n 48,9 \n\n[39] 19,5 \n\n \n \n\nIt can be judged that the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency calculated on this dissertation can be \nwell accepted, once it is in the range with the published studies.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 77 \u2013 [Nor mal-s pee d] TTW  energy per km input. \n\n \n\n \n6. Finding the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel energy efficiency factors per km \n\n \nFor the calculatio n of the well-to-tank energy per km needed to provide the tank-to-wheel \nenergy to move the diesel train, the 106MJ/km as calculated before, it was used the same \n\nmethodology as for the airplane. Once diesel is a fossil liquid fuel, the \u201cJEC Well-to-Wheels\u201d \nstudy provides the relative weight of diesel well-to-tank on diesel tank-to-wheel: the 15,8% as \n\npreviously shown on the Methodology. Therefore, it comes for the calculation of the well-to-\ntank: \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nThe methodology for the electric trains well-to-tank was the same as for the other electric rail \nsub- modes. It was considered both the T&amp;D losses (92% [25]) and the EU?s power plants \n\nefficiency (48% [26]): \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n102 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nThe calculation of the average normal-speed well- to-tank includes both diesel and electric \n\ntrains, and could be done in many different ways.  \nFor purposes of this dissertation, once the occupancy rate was the parameter making the  \n\ntransition between the energy per pkm and per km, it was decided to calculate the average \nwell-to-tank energy per km, in function of the relative weight of the passengers-km for both \ndiesel and electric passengers-km. \n\nThe following equation shows the calculation used:  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nIt was decided to calculate like this in the basis that if more people will travel on diesel or \nelectric trains, the average well-to-tank will be as much closer to the diesel or electric well-to-\n\ntank values, following the respective percentage increase of diesel/ or electric passengers-km \nin the total normal-speed passengers-km. \n \n\nThe calculation of the well-to-wheel is the sum of the well-to-tank and tank-to-wheel, for all \ncases: \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nThese values can already complete the energy efficiency table as showed in Figure 78. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 78 \u2013 [Nor mal-s pee d] W TT and W TW e nergy per  km input. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  103 \n\n \n\n7.

Finding the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions per pkm \n\n \nTaking the total CO2 quantities calculated in the beginning of the Rail (5MtCO2), the first \n\nstep is the calculation of the CO2 efficiency factors in terms o f gCO2/pkm. The following \nequations show the calculation for each tra in and the average normal-speed: \nDiesel trains: \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nElectric trains: \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nAverage normal-speed: \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nRegarding the average CO2 factor of 14gCO2/pkm, it is possible to compare it with other \npublished studies as showed in Table 33. \n\n \nTable 33 \u2013 [Nor mal-s pee d] Comparison of TTW  CO2 efficienc y. \n\n \n\n \nFrom the table, there are significant differences between the calculated average tank-to-wheel \n\nCO2 efficiency per pkm with the other published studies on the topic.  \nAs a reminder, the calculated value of 14gCO2/pkm is the result of considering about 60% of \nthe total tank-to-wheel rail CO2 being emitted for passenger mobility purposes, a  figure that \n\ncomes from the Ex- Tremis model, through the division between the Eurostat railways \npassenger mobility (395bpkm).  \n\n \nThe introduction of the Ex-Tremis model to the separation of the CO2 from passenger \nmobility and freight transport is not viewed as a potential source of errors to calculate a figure \n\nof 14gCO2/pkm.  \n\ngCO2/pkm  \n\nValue of this dissertation 14 \n\n[29] 25 \n\n[30] 65 \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  105 \n\n \n\nFor example, and in order to evaluate the sensibility of this 14gCO2/pkm value, if considering \n\nan extreme case where all rail CO2 is emitted for passenger mobility purposes, a figure of \nabout 20gCO2/pkm would result from calculation: \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nThis value means that if using the Eurostat normal-speed rail value of passengers-km and the \n\npublished tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions, it would be impossible to obtain similar values with \nthe ones published by the other studies, such as 25 or 66gCO2/pkm.  \n\nThe value obtained on this dissertation seems to be lower when compared to the other studies. \nIn one hand, it is not clear within the other studies if those values include also the production \nof the electricity (which would increase the CO2/pkm factor), or if they only consider the \n\ntank-to-wheel contribution from the diesel trains. In other hand, it is also not clear whether the  \nother studies include the contribution from the high-speed rail sector (which would reduce the \n\nCO2 factor). \n \nDespite the differences, and since the energy values presented before were in line with other \n\npublished sources [30] [37] [39], it was decided to continue with the value of 14gCO2/km.  \n \n\n \n10. Finding the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions per km \n\n \n\nThe calculation of the CO2 tank-to-wheel efficiency in terms o f gCO2/km is the same as for \nthe other calculations. It is used the previously calculated values per pkm and multiply them \nby the occupancy rate.  \n\nHere is the diesel case: \n \n\n \n \n\n \nThe electricity case: \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nAnd the average case: \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n106 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n11. Finding the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel CO2 emissions per km \n\n \nThe calculation of the diesel well-to-tank gCO2/km relies on the methodology used before of \n\napplying the JEC  Well-to-Wheel ratios. Here is the diesel case using the 18,8% well-to-tank \nratio: \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nIn the case of electricity, the CO2 well-to-tank is calculated in the same way as for metro and \n\nhigh-speed rail. First calculate the well- to-tank energy consumption at the output of the power \nplant (taking the T&amp;D 92% losses [25]) and then multiply it by the CO2 electricity production \nfactor (115gCO2/MJ): \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFor the calculation of the normal-speed average well- to-tank CO2 efficiency, it is applied the \nsame methodology as it was for the energy case. It is again considered the relative weight of \n\nthe passengers-km data travelling both on diesel and electric trains. \n \n\n  \n\n \n \n\nFor the calculation of the well- to-wheel efficiency in terms of gCO2/km, it is summed the \ncalculated tank-to-wheel value on the previous point (1.323gCO2/km), with the well-to-tank \nvalue calculated right before : \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n12. Finding the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel CO2 emissions per km \n \nHaving calculated the CO2 efficiency factors per km, it remains only the correspondent values \n\nbut in units of gCO2/pkm. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  107 \n\n \n\nIn this case, the well- to-wheel 52gCO2/pkm factor is closer as to the 65gCO2 provided by the \n\nEuropean Commission communication [30], but still the same doubt remains on the scope of \ntheir methodology. Despite the verified differences on the CO2 values when compared to \n\nother studies, given the achieved consistency on the energy efficiency table, it was decided to \ncontinue with the calculated CO2 values.  \n \n\n \n13. Finding the total well-to-tank and well-to-wheel CO2 quantities \n\n \nThe calculation of the total CO2 quantities used the same methodology as before. It multiplies \nthe gCO2/pkm factors with the Eurostat passenger mobility data for the normal-speed rail \n\nsegment (395bpkm).  \nHere is the example of the well-to-tank total CO2 calculation in case of diesel trains, being the \n\nsame for electric trains.  \n \n\n \n \n\n \nAll calculated values can already complete the Total CO2 table as showed in Figure 81. \n \n\n \nFigure 81 \u2013 [Nor mal-s pee d] W TT and W TW total  CO2 input. \n\n \n \n\n14.

The well-to-tank \ndiesel energy consumption represents about 3% of the total we ll-to-wheel energy for rail, \n\ncompared to the electricity well-to-tank which represents about 55%.  \n \n\n \nFigure 83 \u2013 [Nor mal-s pee d] W TW CO2 distri bution. \n\n \n\nThe chart shows that the well-to-wheel CO2 emissions on the normal-speed segment follow a \ndistribution of about 32% for diesel and 68% for electricity. The tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions \nresulting from the usage of diesel trains represents about 27% of the total normal-speed well-\n\nto-wheel CO2 emissions, while the CO2 emissions on the electricity as energy carrier, \nrepresents about 68% and come only from the well-to-tank basis. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  109 \n\n \n\n4.3. Road transport sector \n \nThe road sector was considered on this dissertation as the most important transport mode. \n\nWithin its sub- modes, the bus and the car segments were of special interest on this dissertation, \ngiven its high importance on the passenger mobility scene.  \nOn this dissertation, two different energy approaches will be realized: on one side, it will be \n\nassessed the situation where only fossil fuels are consumed, and on the other side the real \nsituation where biofuels were blended. \n\n \n \n\n4.3.1. Overview of available and required data \n \nSimilarly to what happened to the Rail sector, the Eurostat does not provide all the required \n\ndetails on energy consumption and passenger mobility data for purposes of this dissertation. \nAs an example, it provides the gasoline consumption on the Road sector, but do not make \n\ndifferentiation between the gasoline consumed by cars, by motos or by vans. Also, it provides \npassenger mobility information on bus, but does not provide passenger mobility information \non bus running on diesel or in natural gas.  \n\nTable 64 of the Annexes presents the Eurostat available data and the required data (gray) for \npurposes of this dissertation. Generally speaking, due the information required on this \n\ndissertation, the detail level of the Eurostat is not enough.  \n \nThe Eurostat provides the energy details of each energy carrier used in road transport, but does \n\nnot provide the energy consumed by each sub- mode, as well as its CO2 emissions. O n the \ntransport mobility data, the Eurostat provides interesting details for the passenger car, bus and \nmotorcycle segments. \n\n \nTo fill up the model on both the energy and CO2 tables, it was used the same methodology \n\ntype as for the previous transport modes. O n one hand, it could be first introduced the total \ntank-to-wheel energy consumption and calculate the energy efficiency, or in other side, first \nintroduce the energy efficiency and afterwards calculate the total tank-to-wheel energy \n\nconsumption. \n \n\n \n\n4.3.2. Overview and accuracy of the Tremove data \n \nAs previously described on the State of Art, the Tremove model provides one of the most \nrepresentative European databases on road fleet composition. Within its website, it is possible \n\nto download the data respective to the EU15 and the EU12+2(CH+NO). On this dissertation, \nthe required scope was the EU27 being necessary the re-arrangement of the Tremove?s data.  \n\n  \n \n \n\n  \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n110 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nTremove energy data \n\nThe Tremove provides two separate spreadsheets for the EU15 and EU12+NO+CH individual \nMember States case. Therefore, it was necessary to re-arrange both tables in order to build the \n\nEU27 picture: add the EU15 and EU12 and subtract the NO and C H as countries.  \nAfter re-arranging the Tremove?s data sheets, it was possible to build an EU27 picture for the \nroad sector. Figure 84 provides the information on which energy data can be obtained via the \n\nconsultancy of the Tremove model: \n \n\n \nFigure 84 \u2013 [Road] Tre move road energy data [15]. \n\n \n \n\nThe Tremove provides detailed energy data for each sub- mode of transport, by energy type \nand up to the year o f 2030. It is possible to see, as an example, that in 2010 the car sector is \nexpected to consume about 188.988ktoe of energy, which about 108.069ktoe regards to energy \n\nneeded to power gasoline engines.  \n \n\nThe year of 2007, the reference case on this dissertation, was calculated using an interpolation \nbetween the years of 2000 and 2010.  \nSimilarly as realized in the previous chapter, the appliance of an interpolation can be judged as \n\nan imprecise exercise, and in fact it has the potential to be an imprecise exercise, given the \nenergy context of the year of 2007. According to the published data on Eurostat, the year of \n\n2007 presented one of the highest energy consumption years on the road transport sector. An \ninterpolation between the year of 2000 and 2010 might imply a potential risk of ignoring an \neventual atypical year.  \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  111 \n\n \n\nIn order to analyse the Tremove?s data accuracy, a first comparison with the 2007 interpolated \n\ndata with the Eurostat road energy is presented on Table 34. \n \n\nTable 34 \u2013 [Road] Comparison be twee n Eur ostat and Tre move e nergy, 2007. \n\nktoe Eurostat [11] Tremove [15] Variation (%) \n\nGasoline 105.907 - n.a. \n\nDiesel 188.501 - n.a. \n\nLPG 4.804 4.217 -12% \n\nNatural Gas 732 268 -63% \n\nBioethanol 1.183 - n.a. \n\nBiodiesel 6.587 - n.a. \n\nGasoline+Bioethanol 107.090 127.147 +19% \n\nDiesel+Biodiesel 195.088 159.788 -18% \n\nRoad 307.714 291.419 -5% \n\n \n \n\nThe Tremove presents an overall road energy difference of about 5%, which was not viewed \nas such a big error for purposes of this dissertation. Large and important errors were verified \n\non the discrepancies between the gasoline and diesel values.  \nAs explained before, the Tremove is an old model and did not predicted at that time the recent \nmigration from gasoline into diesel on the private car segment and also the recent expansion of \n\nthe diesel truck segment for freight transport. Might be that those factors explain the \ndifferences on gasoline and diesel from the Tremove.  \n\n \nAnalysing in particular the car sector, the gasoline consumption presented by Tremove is \nhigher when compared to the total gasoline consumed by the road sector in EU: \n\n \n  \n\n \n \n\nThis situation is impossible. It is impossible that the passenger car sector consumed more \ngasoline than the entire road sector. This can be considered as one example of how out of date \ncan be the Tremove?s data when compared to the real situation.  \n\n \n \n\nTremove passenger mobility data \nThe Tremove also provides information on the details of passenger mobility data between road \nsub- modes, by energy type. This was a very good and useful level of information for purposes \n\nof this dissertation. Figure 85 provides the information that is possible to download and re-\narrange from the Tremove?s website: \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n112 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 85 \u2013 [Road] Tre move road passenger mobility data [15]. \n\n \n \n\nThe passenger mobility data provided by the Tremove model was extremely interesting for \npurposes of this dissertation. It was possible to visualize and analyze the passenger mobility \ndemand for each sub-mode of road transport (similarly to the Eurostat) but by energy type \n\n(new information). \nA first comparison with the Eurostat passenger mobility data is shown on Table 35: \n\n \nTable 35 \u2013 [Road] Comparison be twee n Eur ostat and Tre move passenger mobility , 2007. \n\nbpkm Eurostat [11] Tremove [15] Variation (%) \n\nBus 542 514 -5% \n\nCar 4.760 4.880 +3% \n\nMoto* 152 201 +32% \n\nVan - 303 n.a. \n\nRoad 5.454 5.900 +8% \n\n* Moto includes both motorcycle and mopeds. \n\n \n \n\nGenerally speaking, the Tremove provides a very good accuracy level when compared to the \ndata coming from the Eurostat. Desp ite the moto sub- mode, all the other sub- modes seemed to \nbe well modelled by the Tremove, having a global error of about 8%. A note for the passenger \n\nvans segment, as the Eurostat does not provide any statistics, but it seems to be significant \nwhen looking to the data provided by the Tremove. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  113 \n\n \n\nPreliminary conclusions \n\nDespite the achieved consistency on the passenger mobility data, the Tremove presents a \nconsiderable error regarding the energy consumption data. Having the mindset used on this \n\ndissertation, this might have implications in one hand on the energy efficiency implicit on the \nTremove model or, in other hand, significant variations on the occupancy rate.  \nConsidering that the occupancy rate does not justify such an important energy differences, the \n\npotential source of error might reside on the assumed energy efficiency by the Tremove model.  \nIt is not the objective of this dissertation to deeply study the assumptions behind the Tremove \n\nmodel, but it should be in mind that might exist a potential source of errors when interacting \nTremove and Eurostat data. \n \n\n \nEvaluate the Tremove\u2019s accuracy \n\nTo evaluate the accuracy of the Tremove model on the energy efficiency of road transport, \nfirst values were built using the information provided by the Tremove, applied to the Eurostat \ninformation.  \n\nFigure 86 shows the relative weights (%) of energy and passenger mobility by the Tremove \nmodel: \n\n \n\n \nFigure 86 \u2013 [Road] Energy and passenger mobility relati ve  weights on Tre move. \n\n \n \n\nThis table shows, for example, that 36% of the consumed energy by the car sector is in forms \nof blended diesel or for example that 97% of the passenger mobility by bus is running on \n\ndiesel.  \nGiven the data type provided by the Eurostat, Figure 87 shows a re-arrangement of the \nTremove data to easier apply the relative weights to the Eurostat data. It provides the details of \n\neach energy type and how they are consumed by each sub-mode of road transport: \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n114 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 87 \u2013 [Road] Relati ve weights be tween eac h energ y carrier.  \n\n \n \nThis figure shows, for example, that 45% of the diesel consumed on the road transport (incl. \n\nbiodiesel) is currently being consumed by heavy duty trucks for freight transport; or for \nexample that 92% of the road gasoline is consumed by the car sector.  \n\nHaving these relative weights, it was decided to apply them to the Eurostat road energy data. \nFigure 88 shows the result: \n \n\n \nFigure 88 \u2013 [Road] Result of inter acting Tre move  with Eur ostat energ y data.  \n\n \n \n\nThis means that the car segment could potentially have consumed about 98.878ktoe of \ngasoline (incl. Bioethanol) and also that the moto segment consumed about 4.014ktoe of \ngasoline (incl. Bioethanol). \n\nPerforming the same exercise for the case of passenger mobility, it was possible to calculate \nthe passenger mobility data for each sub- mode of road transport, by energy type, as showed in \n\nFigure 89. \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  115 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 89 \u2013 [Road] Result of inter acting Tre move  with Eur ostat passenger mobility data.  \n\n \n \n\nThe table shows, for example, that the bus segment transported about 19billion passengers-km \non natural gas, or that the car segment transported about 2.844bpkm on gasoline. This is a very \n\ngood level of detail for purposes of this dissertation. \n \n \n\nPreliminary calculation of tank-to-wheel energy efficiency values \n\nHaving data both on the total tank-to-wheel energy consumption and on passenger mobility \n\nfor each sub-mode of transport, it was decided to calculate the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency \nvalues in terms of energy/pkm that would result from interacting the previous information.  \n \n\nFor each previous value of each sub-mode of transport, it was divided the e nergy consumption \nby the passenger mobility demand. Figure 90 shows the results: \n\n \n\n \nFigure 90 \u2013 [Road] Preliminary results on e nergy efficiency per pk m. \n\n \n\n \nAfter converting the energy values from ktoe into PJ, it was possible to calculate first MJ/pkm \nvalues. From this table, it is possible to visualize large differences on the energy efficiency by \n\nenergy type within the same sub- mode. For example, it is possible to see that bus running on \nnatural gas shows the double of the energy consumption when compared to the diesel ones; or \nin other hand that the natural gas cars shows the triple of the consumption when compared to \n\ngasoline. \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n116 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nAccording to the mindset on this dissertation, the only factor that might be influencing these \n\nresults is the occupancy rate. However, it is highly impossible that the occupancy rate varies in \nsuch a proportion allowing these differences.  \n\nFor purposes of this dissertation, the occupancy rate was viewed as a parameter that does not \nlargely varies by energy type, and cannot influence the results in such errors by sub- mode and \nby energy type.  \n\n \nFrom this exercise, it was concluded that the direct application of the relative weights from \n\nTremove to the totals of the Eurostat energy and passenger mobility data, did not provide \ncalibrated results. In that case, this methodology was discarded urging the need to use external \nsources. \n\n \n \n\n4.3.3. External sources \n \nOnce the car sector was of especially interest on this dissertation, newer sources of \n\ninformation were tried to obtain in order to better characterize its 2007 situation. At that time, \nthe recently published \u201cJEC Biofuels Programme\u201d was viewed as a reliable source of \n\ninformation due its research on road fleet composition and energy consumption. It is a \nresearch study conducted by the JEC consortium which analysed the details of all road fleet \ncomposition, its energy consumption and performance.  \n\n \nThrough the attendance of several internal meetings at Toyota Motor Europe [43], it was \n\npossible to have energy data for the year of 2007, specifically for the car sector. The level of \ndetail is similar to the Tremove, but more representative of the actual situation. It is not \npossible to provide the detailed energy data from the \u201cJEC Biofuels Programme\u201d, being only \n\npossible to provide the approximate values.  \nTable 36 shows the results of the energy data: \n\n \nTable 36 \u2013 [Road] \u201cJ EC Bi ofuels Programme\u201d energy de tails  [12]. \n\nMtoe Car Road Rest (Road-Car) \n\nGasoline ~100 ~110 ~10 \n\nDiesel ~60 ~190 ~130 \n\nLPG ~4 ~4 ~0 \n\nNatural Gas (CNG) ~0 ~0 ~0 \n\nBioethanol ~1 ~1 ~0 \n\nBiodiesel ~2 ~6 ~4 \n\n \n \n\nThe table shows the total tank-to-wheel energy consumption by the car segment, in 2007, as \nwell as the total Road tank-to-wheel energy consumption. Having these two values, it is \npossible to subtract the car energy data to the road energy data and build a \u201erest? tank-to-wheel \n\nenergy data. \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  117 \n\n \n\nFigure 91 attempts to show how the data coming from the \u201cJEC Biofuels Programme\u201d is \n\nsimilar to the one published by the Eurostat. It was so viewed as a reliable source of \ninformation for purposes of this dissertation. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 91 \u2013 [Road] Comparison be twee n Eur ostat and \u201cJ EC Biofuel Pr ogramme\u201d [11, 12]. \n\n \n\n \nOn the most representative energy carriers at the road transport level, gasoline and diesel, the \n\nJEC value is about 2% higher for gasoline and 1% lower for diesel. It was so viewed as a very \naccurate data for purposes of this dissertation. \n \n\n \nThe passenger car sub-mode \n\nThe \u201cJEC Biofuels Programme \u201d provides also one important parameter of the passenger car \nsector performance: the annua l running volume in kilometres, about ~3.333x10\n\n9\nkm [12]. \n\nHaving this value and having the total energy consumption for the car sector, it was possible \n\nto build an important parameter for purposes of this dissertation: the average tank-to-wheel \nenergy consumption for the car sector in terms of energy/km.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nThe other sub-modes \n\nIn the absence of details for the other road transport sub- modes (bus, moto, passenger van and \n\nfreight), it was decided to use the rest of the road information and apply the respective relative \nweights from the Tremove model. Note that LPG it is only being consumed by the car sector \nand regarding CNG is both consumed by the passenger car and bus. \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n118 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nFigure 92 shows the rest-road relative weights coming from the Tremove model for the modes \n\nof bus, moto, passenger van and freight (heavy duty and light duty trucks), on gasoline (incl. \nbioethanol) and diesel (incl. biodiesel): \n\n \n\n \nFigure 92 \u2013 [Road] Result of Tre move\u2019s relati ve weights to J EC details. \n\n \n \n\nThis table means that the remaining diesel is being 78% consumed by the freight transport, \nand for example 45% of the remaining gasoline is being consumed by the passenger vans  \n\nsegment. Applying these relative weights, it was possible to build energy figures for the sub-\nmodes of bus, moto, van and freight. Table 37 shows those calculated figures.  \n \n\nTable 37 \u2013 [Road] Input values on the energy table.  \n\nMtoe Bus Moto Van Freight \n\nGasoline - 3,0 2,4 - \n\nDiesel 9,8 - 17,8 95,7 \n\nNatural gas 0,4 - - - \n\nBioethanol - 0,0 0,0 - \n\nBiodiesel 0,3 -- 0,6 3,3 \n\n \n \n\n4.3.4.

Here, it was required to make the separation between diesel and natural gas on the  \n\nbus passenger mobility scene.  \nFor purposes of this dissertation, the differences on the combustion efficiency between diesel \nand natural gas engine types were not taken into account, as they would not bring such \n\nimportant potential differences for the final objective of the dissertation. Therefore, it was \nassumed the same efficiency per pkm for both energy types.  \n\n \nTherefore, under this assumption, the calculation of the diesel passenger mobility data will \nrely directly on the proportion of the diesel energy to the total bus energy: \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nAnd the respective natural gas passenger mob ility data: \n \n\n  \n\n \n\nThese values can already be introduced on the energy and CO2 tables, for both energy type, as \nshowed in Figure 93. \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n120 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 93 \u2013 [B us ] First values  input. \n\n \n \n\n1. Finding tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm \n \n\nNow it is possible to fill up the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm column, since the \nvalues for the total tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 quantities, as well as the passenger mobility \ndata by energy type is known.  \n\nThe following equation calculates the average tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm for the \ndiesel case: \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nThe associated CO2 efficiency factor in case of only fossil diesel considered:  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nAnd the CO2 efficiency factor in case of blended diese l considered: \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nThe same procedure was applied to the natural gas case. The final results for the tank-to-wheel \nenergy and CO2 efficiency per pkm are as shown in Table 39. \n \n\nTable 39 \u2013 [Bus] Energy and CO2 efficiency per pk m. \n\n MJ/pkm gCO2/pkm \n\nDiesel only 0,81 60 \n\nDiesel blended 0,81 58 \n\nNatural gas 0,81 46 \n\nAverage 0,81 57-59 \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  121 \n\n \n\nThe same value of energy efficiency per pkm (0,81MJ/pkm) is the result from the assumption \n\npreviously explained of non-considering the combustion efficiency differences between diesel \nand natural gas engines. The only differences resides on the CO2 efficiency factors which are  \n\nboth influenced by the presence of biodiesel in the diesel bus, and the used conversion factors \nfor natural gas and diesel.  \nThe average value of bus is highly influenced by the large utilization of diesel bus within the \n\nEU level. \n \n\nComparison with other sources \n\n \nTable 40 \u2013 [Bus] Comparison of energy and CO2 e fficiency per pk m. \n\n MJ/pkm gCO2/pkm \n\nValue of this dissertation 0,81 57-59 \n\n[30] [0,35-1,42] 45 \n\n[39] 1,17  \n\n[44] 0,9 80 \n\n[45] 1,1  \n\n \n \n\nTable 40 shows a variety of energy and CO2 efficiency factors for bus. It might be that the \nassumed occupancy rate behind each calculation is potentially influencing the results on both \n\nstudies. Having this variety of data, the next step should be the calculation of the occ upancy \nrate and then the calculation of the tank-to-wheel energy consumption in terms of energy/km, \nwith the objective of validating the values until now. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 94 \u2013 [B us] TTW energ y per pk m input. \n\n \n\n \n2. Finding the occupancy rate \n\n \nSimilarly to the exercise realized on the previous modes, here the required number should \nrepresent the European average number of passengers per bus.  \n\nFor the average maximum seat capacity of the most used bus at European level, it was \nassumed a value of 50seats/bus with the respective increase of 20% [41] due the standing \n\ncapacity. For the European average load factor, it was used the value advanced by the  \nEuropean Energy Agency of 33,5% [34]. \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n122 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nBoth values combined result in an European average of 20passengers/bus, representing the \n\nannual average on all hours of the day. It is not the objective of this dissertation to study peak \nor non-peak hours, week or weekend days, but to have an European average representative of \n\nthe annual situation. \nAs additional information, a study conducted by \u201cVolvo Buses Environment\u201d also advances \nthe same value of 20passengers/bus [46]. \n\n \nAnother situation, not so important and similarly to the previously done to the normal-speed \n\nrail, is related with the assumption of the same number of passengers per bus both for the \ndiesel and CNG (the same occupancy rate for both energy types).  \n \n\n \nFigure 95 \u2013 [B us] Occupancy rate input. \n\n \n\n \n3. Finding the tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 efficiency per km \n\n \n\nSimilarly as previously realized, it was decided to calculate the tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 \nefficiencies in terms of energy and CO2 per km. Here is the case of diesel bus, being the same \n\nmethodology for the natural gas case : \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nTable 41 summarizes the achieved values for the other energy carriers: \n \n\nTable 41 \u2013 [Bus] Calculate d e nergy and CO2 efficiency per km. \n\n MJ/vehicle.km gCO2/vehicle.km \n\nDiesel only 16,4 1.200 \n\nDiesel blended 16,4 1.159 \n\nNatural gas 16,4 922 \n\nAverage 16,4 1.151-1.190 \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  123 \n\n \n\nUsing several conversion factors, for example, it results that the average energy efficiency of \n\nthe buses at European level is about 50liters per 100km. Within the literature it was possible to \nfind several values for comparison as showed in Table 42. \n\n \nTable 42 \u2013 [Bus ] Comparison of energy and CO2 e fficiency  per k m. \n\n MJ/vehicle.km gCO2/vehicle.km l/vehicle.100km \n\nValues of this dissertation 16,4 1.151-1.190 50 \n\n[45] 11,8   \n\n[46]   43 \n\n[47]  551-994 28 \n\n[48]  1.600 39-50 \n\n \n \n\nAs previously showed in Table 40, the energy efficiency in terms of energy/pkm is in line with \nthe used data sources while the energy efficiency in terms of energy/km seems to present some \nvariations. The problem might be on the occupancy rate assumptions that were taken behind \n\nthe calculation on each study. \nDespite the verified differences such as the 28l/100km co mpared to the calculated 50l/100km, \n\nit was decided to continue with the calculated value once there are other studies that advance  \nvalues closer such as the 43l/100km or the 50l/100km.  \n \n\n \n4. Finding the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel energy and CO2 per km and per pkm \n\n \nThe calculation of the well-to-tank and well-to-wheel energy and CO2 efficiency factors \nfollowed the methodology described on chapter 3.3.4, being the last step needed to fill the \n\nfinal energy and CO2 efficiency tables. Figure 141 and Figure 142 of Annexes show the \ncomplete energy and CO2 efficiency tables.  \n \n\n \n5. Finding total well-to-tank and well-to-wheel final energy and CO2 quantities \n\n \nThe calculation of the final energy and CO2 quantities used the same methodology as before. \nIt multiplies each calculated factor per pkm obtained before by the calculated passenger \n\nmobility demand for each energy type.  Figure 143 and Figure 144 of Annexes show the final \nvalues. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n124 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n6. Bus results \n\n \nThe following chart resumes the well-to-wheel energy distribution by the bus sector.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 96 \u2013 [B us ] W TW e nergy distri bution.  \n\n \n\n \nThe inner ring shows that about 96% of the energy consumed by the bus segment is in forms \n\nof blended diesel (with biodiesel), with the remaining 4% in forms of natural gas. From the \nsecond ring it is possible to conclude that about 14% of the well-to-wheel energy consumed by \nthe bus sector refers to the case of blended diesel. \n\nA similar format was obtained for the well-to-wheel CO2 emissions: \n \n\n \nFigure 97 \u2013 [B us] W TW CO2 distribution. \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  125 \n\n \n\n4.3.5. The calculation flow: car \n \nUnderstanding the energy and CO2 well-to-wheel situation of the car sector was of especially \n\ninterest for purposes of this dissertation however it was performed through a different \nmethodology. Hence, it was also required to consider the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency \ndifferences between engine types (gasoline, diesel, LPG and CNG) and the correspondent \n\ndifferences on the amount of passenger mobility by energy type.  \n \n\n \nEnergy and CO2 data \nAs explained before, the \u201cJEC Biofuels Programme\u201d provides a very good level of detail for \n\npurposes of this dissertation. It was possible to directly input the total tank-to-wheel energy \ndata for each engine type as well as the average tank-to-wheel energy efficiency for the \n\naverage car fleet in 2007.  \nIn spite of the internal and confidential matters, it is not possible to provide the detailed tank-\nto-wheel energy data. Therefore, Table 43 shows the approximate data that was used on this \n\ndissertation for the passenger car segment: \n \n\nTable 43 \u2013 [Car ] \u201cJ EC Bi ofuels Progr amme\u201d details [12]. \n\n Energy PJ MtCO2 \n\nGasoline ~4.000 PJ ~300 MtCO2 \n\nDiesel ~3.000 PJ ~200 MtCO2 \n\nLPG ~200 PJ ~10 MtCO2 \n\nCNG ~5 PJ ~0 MtCO2 \n\nBioethanol ~40 PJ 0 MtCO2 \n\nBiodiesel ~100 PJ 0 MtCO2 \n\nAnnual mileage (x10\n9\n) ~3.333km \n\nAverage consumption ~2 MJ/km ~200 gCO2/km \n\n \n\n \nNote: it should be clear that it is not possible to provide a ll the exact energy and CO2 \n\nquantities from the \u201cJEC Biofuel P rogramme\u201d however, in all the calculations realized within \nthis dissertation, the exact values were used.  \n \n\nSimilarly to the exercise realized for the bus, here it was used a scenario where there are not \nbiofuels in use (only fossil) and then built a real situation considering the biofuels in use in \n\n2007. The calculation of the \u201conly fossil energy scenario\u201d is the result of summing up the \nbiofuel into the respective fossil fuel: \n \n\n  \n\n \n  \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n126 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n1. Calculate the tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 efficiency per pkm \n\n \nGiven the Eurostat car passenger mobility data, 4.760bpkm [11], it was possible to build an \n\naverage energy and CO2 tank-to-wheel efficiency factor. Here it was used the value of only \nfossil energy to represent the energy situation without taking into account the presence of \nbiofuels. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nAlthough it was decided to use the calculated values from the \u201cJEC Biofuel Programme \u201d, \n\nTable 44 summarizes a comparison with other studies.  \n \n\nTable 44 \u2013 [Car ] Comparison of e nergy and CO2 efficiency. \n\n MJ/pkm gCO2/pkm \n\nValue of this dissertation 1,5 110 \n\n[29]  75 \n\n[30] 0,57-4,65 125 \n\n[47] 1,64  \n\n \n \nThe values were selected in such a way to provide a kind of \u201eextreme? scenarios on the energy \n\nand CO2 tank-to-wheel efficiency factors.  \nThe next step should be the characterization of the average occupancy rate in order to continue \n\nwith the calculation of the energy and CO2 factors per km.  \n  \n \n\n2. Finding the occupancy rate \n \n\nThe calculation of the occupancy rate was realized in a different way when compared to the \nother sub- modes. The objective was not to calculate the average maximum seat capacity of the \nEuropean car fleet but to directly input a value of passengers per car. \n\n \nHere, and with the objective of having all variables mathematically related on both energy and \n\nCO2 tables, it was decided to not search within the literature for an occupancy rate value but \nto calculate which occupancy rate would result from the usage of the annual mileage of the \n\u201cJEC Biofuels Programme\u201d and the passenger mobility data from the Eurostat. The following \n\nequation shows the calculation: \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  127 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nIt was divided the passenger mobility data from the Eurostat by the total amount of kilometres \n\ntravelled by all passenger cars in the EU, resulting on the average number of passengers/car.  \nComparing to other external sources, the calculated value corresponds to the range of average \noccupancy rates provided by the European Energy Agency in its publication [34]: 1,56; 1,69; \n\n1,53; 1,78; 1,54. \n \n\n \n3. Finding detailed engine type tank-to-wheel energy efficiency \n\n \n\nAs described before, o ne of the objectives of this dissertation and in particular of this chapter \nwas, on one hand, to attempt to reproduce the real passenger mobility situation between \n\ngasoline and diesel cars, given their d ifferences on energy efficienc y; and on other hand to \nmathematically relate the passenger mobility activity on the passenger car segment by energy \ntype. \n\nTo solve this problem, it was decided to build a small equation system in order to calculate the \ndifferences on the tank-to-wheel energy consumption which might exist between the four \n\nconsidered engine types: gasoline, diesel, LPG and CNG. This equation system was used \nafterwards to calculate the individual passenger mobility for each energy type.  \nThe following matrix shows the mindset for this calculation:  \n\n \n \n\n Eq.14  \n\n \n \n\nThe \u201cFC g\u201d, \u201cFCd\u201d, \u201cFC lpg\u201d and \u201cFCcng\u201d represents the tank-to-wheel fuel consumption (FC) \nof gasoline, diesel, LPG and CNG cars respectively. \nThe \u201cPKM\u201d means the passengers-km for each energy type of gasoline, diesel, LPG and CNG.  \n\nThe \u201cJEC\u201d means the total tank-to-wheel energy consumption from the \u201cJEC Biofuel \nProgramme\u201d for each energy type of gasoline, diesel, LPG and CNG.  \n\n \n \nMindset explanation \n\n \n\nThe idea was to multiply each \u201cFC \u201d factor by the correspondent \u201cPKM\u201d value in order to have \nthe tank-to-wheel energy data provided by the \u201cJEC Biofuels Programme\u201d. The following \n\nequation shows the idea: \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n128 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n Eq. 15 \n\n \n \nOnce it was assumed that the occupancy rate does not vary with the energy type, it was \n\npossible to realize this exercise using the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency in terms of \nenergy/pkm. \n\n \nAs a boundary condition of the equation system, the sum of all \u201cPKM\u201d? should be equal to the \nvalue provided by the Eurostat on the passenger mobility for cars: 4.760bpkm.  \n\n \n Eq. 16 \n\n \n \n\nMethodology explanation \n\n \n\nHaving defined the equation system and its boundary conditions, the next step is to construct \nseveral relations that allow the replacement of variables such as the \u201cFC \u201d to simplify the \nequation system and reduce the number of unknowns. \n\nHere, it was decided to create percentage relations between each \u201cFC \u201d factor for each energy \ntype, in order to represent their combustion efficiency differences. This exercise was realized \n\nunder the methodology that assuming a reference tank-to-wheel energy efficiency for gasoline \nengines (FC g) as \u201cx \u201d, all the other remaining \u201cFC \u201d will come in function of the gasoline \u201cx\u201d. \n \n\nHence, and as reported before, the \u201cJEC Well-to-Wheels\u201d study provides tank-to-wheel \nenergy consumption data for each power train and fuel type. Within its results, it was possible \n\nto build four average tank-to-wheel energy co nsumptions for each engine type. The results are \npresented on Table 45 with the associated variation to gasoline.  \n \n\nTable 45 \u2013 [Car ] Energ y efficiency variati ons (% ) to gasoline [17]. \n\n JEC MJ/100km Var to gasoline % \n\nGasoline 217 n.a. \n\nDiesel 183 -15,5% \n\nLPG 224 +3,5% \n\nCNG 225 +3,9% \n\n \n\n \nThe table shows that the diesel tank-to-wheel energy efficiency is about 15,5% lower when \n\ncompared to the gasoline one, and that the respective LPG and CNG efficiencies are about 4% \nhigher.  \nHaving these percentage relations respecting the gasoline,  it was possible to update the \n\nprevious equation system in function of \u201cx\u201d: \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  129 \n\n \n\n Eq.17  \n\n \n\n \nHaving the other two additional boundary conditions: \n\n \n Eq. 16 \n\n \n Eq. 18 \n\n \n \n\nIt was possible to solve and calculate the final solution: \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \nTable 46 shows the approximate results: \n\n \nTable 46 \u2013 [Car ] Equation syste m results. \n\nMJ/pkm Values of this dissertation Other studies \n\nGasoline ~1,5 1,79 [47] \n\nDiesel ~1,4 1,42 [47] \n\nLPG ~1,7  \n\nCNG ~1,7 1,44 [47] \n\n \n\n \nSimilarly to Table 44, this table also attempts to show that it is possible to find different tank-\nto-wheel energy efficiency per pkm values for each fuel type. Despite, for example, the large \n\ndifference calculated for the compressed natural gas engine, it was decided to not change the \ncalculated values and use them as they were calculated. \n\n \n \n\n4. Calculate the passenger mobility data by energy type \n\n \nWith the previously calculated factors and having the total tank-to-wheel energy consumption \n\nprovided by the \u201cJEC Biofuels Programme \u201d, it was possible to calculate the correspondent \npassenger mobility data for each energy type. Here is the example for gasoline: \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n130 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nRealizing the same exercise for the other energy types, the final results are obtained and \npresented in Table 47: \n \n\nTable 47 \u2013 [Car ] P assenger mobility by energy type.  \n\nbpkm Passenger mobility \n\nGasoline ~2.700 \n\nDiesel ~2.000 \n\nLPG 97 \n\nCNG 3 \n\n \nThrough this methodology, it was possible to individually characterize the passenger mobility \nsituation on the car sector by the four used energy types, taking into account the potential \n\ncombustion efficiency differences of each engine type. This was a very interesting level of \ndetail for purposes of this dissertation. \n\nAs a reminder note, this methodology does not provide an exact European average situation, \nbut using the same data sources as for the other calculations, it was possible to build a \npotential European figure. These values can already be introduced on both energy and CO2 \n\ntables as showed in Figure 147 of Annexes. \n \n\n \n5. Finding the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per km \n\n \n\nHaving calculated the figures of tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm, the calculation only \nrequires the multiplication by the occupancy rate. Here is the example for gasoline: \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n \n\nAnd the final results for the other engines on Table 48: \n \n\nTable 48 \u2013 [Car ] TTW  energy e fficiency per k m. \n\nMJ/vehicle.km  \n\nGasoline ~2,8 \n\nDiesel ~2,5 \n\nLPG ~2,8 \n\nCNG ~2,8 \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  131 \n\n \n\nThese values would correspond to the average tank-to-wheel energy efficiency of the car fleet \n\nby energy type. It is possible to conclude the higher energy efficiency of the diesel engines \ncompared to the remaining energy types, which results from the assumptions taken behind \n\non % tank-to-wheel energy efficiency reductions as described in Table 45. \nWithin the literature, other values were found as showed in Table 49: \n \n\nTable 49 \u2013 [Car ] Comparison of e nergy efficiency.  \n\n Value of this dissertation Other studies \n\nGasoline ~2,8 MJ/vehicle.km \n\n9,1 l/100km (2,93MJ/km) [18] \n9,1 l/100km (2,93MJ/km) [49] \n7,8 l/100km (2,51MJ/km) [50] \n\n7,9 l/10km (2,54MJ/km) [19] \n7,5 l/100km (2,69MJ/km) [19] \n\nDiesel ~2,5 MJ/vehicle.km \n\n7,1 l/100km (2,54MJ/km) [18] \n7,8 l/100km (2,79 MJ/km) [49] \n5,8 l/100km (2,1MJ/km) [50] \n\n6,6 l/100km (2,37MJ/km) [19] \n7,7 l/100km (2,76MJ/km) [19] \n\nThe comparison between the calculated values and other studies on the topic leads to the \nconclusion that the calculated values are within the range of other studies. \n \n\n \n6. Finding well-to-tank and well-to-wheel energy efficiency per km \n\n \n\nSimilarly to the exercise realized for the bus, the same methodology was applied to the car \nsector to find the well- to-tank and well-to-wheel energy and CO2 efficiency factors, both for \n\nthe case of only fossil and with biofuels.  \n \n \n\n7. Finding total energy and CO2 well-to-wheel quantities \n \n\nThis calculation was the result of the multiplication between the energy and CO2 efficiency \nfactors in terms of energy/pkm and CO2/pkm and the calculated passenger mobility data by \nenergy type calculated on the point number 4.  \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n132 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n8.

Here, and similarly to the bus segment, no differentiation was \nmade between the two energy efficiencies for gasoline or diesel engines, being assumed to be \nthe same. \n\nThe Eurostat does not publish any value of passenger mobility for vans, being used for \npurposes of this dissertation the value published by the Tremove model: 303bpkm [15]. \n\n \nThe following equation shows the simple way on how was calculated the average tank -to-\nwheel energy efficiency in terms of energy and CO2 per pkm: \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n \n\nThis figure is slightly higher compared to the figures of passenger car, but it was assumed as \n\nnormal once by general knowledge, vans are more energy intense than passenger cars.  \n \n\n \nFinding the occupancy rate \n\n \n\nIt was not decided to study in the details of the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency of passenger \nvans. In that case, only for representative matters, the occupancy rate assumed in this case was \n\nthe same as for passenger cars: ~1,5. \n \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  135 \n\n \n\nFinding the energy and CO2 final values \n\n \n\nSimilarly to the previous exercises, the calculation of all well-to-tank, tank-to-wheel and well-\n\nto-wheels values relies on the same methodology used before. Therefore, it is already possible \nto fill up all the columns in both the energy and CO2 tables as showed in Figure 150 and \nFigure 151 of Annexes. \n\n \n \n\n4.3.8. The calculation flow: freight \n \nAs explained before, the evaluation of the energy consumption and CO2 emissions for freight \n\ntransport will not be as detailed as the previous calculations. The objective of this calculation \nwas only to determine the contribution from the freight transport sector for the overall \n\ntransport well-to-wheel energy consumption and CO2 emissions. No calculation of energy \nefficiencies between truck or light duty vans were made, as well as no research on the average \nload factors for trailers, semi-trailers or other kind of support. \n\nFigure 100 and Figure 101 show the tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 quantities already \ncalculated before, together with the introduction of the well-to-tank and well- to-wheel \n\nquantities. \n \n\n \nFigure 100 \u2013 [Freight] Comple te energ y de tails. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 101 \u2013 [Freight] Comple te CO2 de tails. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n136 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nFrom the calculation, it was possible to conclude that the freight transport segment emitted \n\nabout 356MtCO2 on the well- to-wheel basis, resulting from the combustion of about 4.005PJ \nof diesel and 140PJ of Biodiesel (considered as zero on the tank-to-wheel basis). \n\n \n \n\n4.4. Sea transport sector \n \nSimilarly to the freight transport case, the well-to-wheel sea sector contribution for the total \n\nenergy and CO2 emissions was calculated with a simple methodology. Once was not required \nto individually study differences according to the craft type, boat or vessels, it was possible to \ntake directly the value from the Eurostat?s database, which represents the tank-to-wheel \n\nenergy and CO2 emissions. Here, and differently from the road transport mode, the Eurostat \ndata shows that no biodiesel is c urrently being consumed by the sea transport mode. \n\n \nIn relation to the passenger mobility and freight transport, given the discrepancy between the \nton-km transported compared to the pass-km announced by Eurostat, 1.679tkm vs 41bpkm, it \n\nwas considered that the Sea sector is currently being used for freight transport purposes.  \nTable 52 shows the energy Eurostat data for Sea sector: \n\n \n \n\nTable 52 \u2013 [Sea] Eur ostat energy data [11]. \n\nPJ  \n\nGasoline 13 \n\nDiesel 177 \n\nResidual oil fuel 81 \n\n \n\n \nFor simply the problem it was assumed that all energies are considered as being diesel, in a \ntotal amount of 6.467ktoe. Converting to CO2, this corresponds to about 20MtCO2. The \n\nvalues could already be introduced on the total tables as showed in Figure 152 and Figure 153 \nof Annexes. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  137 \n\n \n\n4.5. Driving domain study (urban areas) \n \nResulting from the internal analysis on mobility driving patterns, it was possible to input data \n\non the passenger mobility demand for the sub- modes: airplanes, metro/tram, normal- and high-\nspeed rail, bus, car, moto and van, according to the three defined driving domains: urban, rural \nand highway. It is not possible to describe the detailed methodology behind this calculation, \n\nbut as a principle review, these  three main driving domains were calculated on the basis of six \nnational mobility surveys fo r the member states of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the \n\nNetherlands and the United K ingdom, which provided data on the percentages of passengers \ntravelling on those driving domains.  \n \n\nMethodology \n\n \n\nResulting from the analysis, it was defined that distances up to 40km were considered to be \nurban (short distance), and distances higher than 80km considered as highway (long distance), \nbeing Rural (medium distance) in the range of 40-80km.  \n\nThe principle behind this decision of 40km for short distance was based on the circular \ndimension of 115 European cities, where their average radio is about 20km. 40km would \n\ncorrespond to a trip in both ways, go and back. The decision for 80km as long-distance was \nbased on the psychological behaviour of people which means that distances more than 80km \ncorresponds to about 1h driving, which is considered as a long-distance trip for the majority of \n\nthe people. \n \n\n \nDriving domain distribution \n\n \n\nThe definition of short, medium and long-distance should be done for each individual sub-\nmode, as it is considered as no  sense divide urban areas for airplanes, as an example. For \n\npurposes of this dissertation the objective was to study in relation to the road sector, and so it \nwas decided to apply the same distribution for all modes and sub- modes. \nTable 53 summarizes the calculated percentages assumed on this dissertation: \n\n \nTable 53 \u2013 [Ur ban] \u2013 Dri ving domain percentage distri bution  [51]. \n\n Urban Rural Highway \n\n 0-40km 40-80km >80km \n\nAir 0% 0% 100% \n\nMetro 100% 0% 0% \n\nRail 33% 33% 33% \n\nBus 83% 6% 11% \n\nCar 60% 14% 26% \n\nMoto 84% 16% 0% \n\nVan 60% 14% 26% \n\n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n138 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \n\nAs a limitation of the available data on the national surve ys, only the passenger transport sub-\nmodes such as bus, car and motos were considered. Therefore, it was assumed that the air \n\nsector perform trips only on longer distances (100% above 80km), the rail sector was decided \nto perform equally distributed distances (33% for each distance), the metro was considered to \nperform only distances within urban areas (100% 0-40km), and the passenger vans was \n\nconsidered to have the same distribution as cars.  \nA special note on the rail sector, in the case of high-speed rail it was assumed to be only \n\nlonger distances, and so the 33% only refers to the specific case of normal-speed rail. \n \nFor example, applying the passenger car distribution to the Eurostat passenger car mobility in \n\n2007, the urban passenger mobility done by passenger car would be about 2.856bpkm: \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \nThis value would correspond to the total amount of passengers-km realized on urban areas by \n\npassenger car according to the defined urban areas parameters.  \n \n \n\nDriving domain results \n\n \n\nApplying the percentage distributions to each passenger mobility demand for each sub - mode \nof transport, it was possible to calc ulate and distribute all the passenger mobility for each case. \nTable 54 summarizes the passenger mobility distribution for each transport sub- mode: \n\n \nTable 54 \u2013 [Ur ban] P assenger mobility distri bution by dri ving domain. \n\nbpkm Urban Rural Long \n\n 0-40km 40-80km >80km \n\nAir 0 0 572 \n\nMetro 86 0 0 \n\nRail 132 132 132 \n\nHigh-speed 0 0 89 \n\nBus 450 33 60 \n\nCar 2.856 666 1.238 \n\nMoto 128 24 0 \n\nVan 182 42 79 \n\nTotal by domain 3.833 897 2.168 \n\nTOTAL  6.899  \n\nDistribution (%) 56% 13% 31% \n\n \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  139 \n\n \n\nThe table shows that about 56% of the total passenger mobility was performed within the \n\nurban areas, and about 31% was performed on longer distances. Also, it is possible to calculate \nthat within the urban areas the passenger car segment is responsible for about 75% of all \n\nmobility demand. Also, it presents a large importance at the long-distance mobility demand.  \nFigure 102 attempts to provide a visual picture of the previous table: \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 102 \u2013 [Ur ban] P assenger mobility distri bution by dri ving domain.  \n\n \n \nFrom the inner ring, it is possible to confirm that urban areas are responsible for about 56% of \n\nall passengers-km in 2007, followed by long-distance transport with about 31%. From the \nsecond ring it is possible to conclude the large importance of the car segment to the total \n\npassengers-km, about 41%. O n the long distance, the air sector appears as the second most \nimportant passenger mode, representing about 8% of total passengers-km, after car. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nModel development and calibration  \n\n \n\n140 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n4.6.

Its objective is to detail the passenger mobility \nsegment and in particular the car sector. It is also required to provide the information of the \nurban areas contribution for the total energy and CO2 picture.  \n\n \n \n\nEnergy and CO2 well-to-wheel \nThe following chart resumes the well-to-wheel energy distribution calculated on this \ndissertation, by transport mode. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 103 \u2013 [Model] W TW energy distri buti on  by mode. \n\n \n\n \nAs expected, and confirmed by the inner sing, the road sector appears as the most important \n\nenergy consumer on the total transport scene, account ing about 84%.

Development of 2020 scenarios \n \nThis chapter can be considered as one of the most important chapters for purposes of this \n\ndissertation, as it finally makes use of all the work previously realized. Its objective is to make \nuse of the achieved structure and data of the transport 2007 model described on the \nMethodology and Model development and calibration, to realize several technical and non-\n\ntechnical changes (through the input of external data sources), and finally to calculate and to \ncompare the energy and CO2 well- to-wheel impacts to the reference case.  \n\nHere it should be clear that this exercise will be realized only for the passenger mobility \ntransport modes, and did not include any particular predictions or analysis for the freight \ntransport segment.  \n\n \nOn a first step, will be analyzed the non-technical measures such as the increase on passenger \n\nmobility, the modal-shift into collective transport modes and the expansion of the high-speed \nrail, and on a second step, the technical measures such as the improvements on energy \nefficiency, the uptake of renewable energies and electric vehicles. Finally, all measures will be \n\ncombined in order to prospect a likely scenario for 2020.  \nIt is not objective of this dissertation to study all possible scenarios but, based on the used data \n\nsources and internal calculations, to provide one likely future scenario.  \n \n \n\n5.1. Non-technical measures \n \n\nUnder the non-technical measures previously mentioned is the expected mobility demand (as a \nmeaning of the business as usual scenario ), the modal-shift into collective transport modes  \nsuch as bus, metro and railways, and the deployment of the high-speed rail infrastructure \n\npreviewed by the trans-European networks for transport (TEN-T). \n \n\n \n\n5.1.1. Business as usual \n \nAs a common exercise on the majority of energy and transport studies, is the development of a \nbusiness as usual scenario (BAU). This is often calculated to provide the likely situation that \n\nmight exist if no external changes on the analyzed system are implemented. It means that if no \ntechnical or other kind of progression happens, a variation on t he usage level of a random \n\nsystem will result in a proportional variation of its output results.  \nApplied to the transport sector, the evaluation of a business as usual scenario takes as \nfundamentally changes the increase on the usage of transport (passenger mobility or freight \n\ntransport) and as output the likely increase on its released CO2 emissions. \n \n\nThe expected 2020 value of passenger mobility demand for the sub- modes analyzed on this \ndissertation was internally calculated and therefore, it is not possible to provide the detailed \nmethodology behind its calculation due confidential matters. As a general overview, the \n\nmethodology took  into account the expected population growth in both separately EU15 and \n\n\n\nDevelopment of 2020 scenarios \n\n \n\n148 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nEU12, the expected evolution on the motorisation rates levels and the evolution on the inland \n\npassenger mobility use. \nTable 55 provides the information results for the calculated 2020 passenger mobility demand: \n\n \nTable 55 \u2013 [Future ] Calcul ate d 2020 passenger mobility de mand.  \n\nbpkm Eurostat 2007 Calculated 2020 Var (%) \n\nAir 572 1.083 89% \n\nMetro 86 107 24% \n\nNormal and High-speed rail 484 512 6% \n\nBus 542 595 10% \n\nCar 4.760 5.280 11% \n\nMoto 152 192 26% \n\nVan* 303 352 16% \n\nTOTAL 6.899 8.122 18% \n\n* Value d irectly co ming fro m Tre move.  \n\n \n\nAccording to the calculations, it is expected that aviation will see the largest growth for the \ndecade to come, almost doubling its passenger mobility demand. The iTREN study advances a \nvalue of 565bpkm [14] for 2020, but it cannot be compared to this one as it only includes \n\nintra-EU aviation. \nIn case of the rail sector, the calculations showed that by 2020 it is expected an increase of 6%, \n\ntill the level of 512bpkm, but did not took into account the expected deployment of the new \nhigh-speed infrastructures. Here, the iTREN advances a value of 616bpkm by 2020 which \nincludes the expected new high-speed lines [14]. \n\nFor the bus sector, the calculation showed an increase of 10%, to the value of 595bpk m, very \nsimilar to the iTREN value, 598bpkm [14]. In case of car segment, the calculations showed an \n\nincrease of 11%, to the value of 5.280bpkm, which is also very similar to the value of the \niTREN, 5.328bpkm [14]. \nThe value for the van segment appears in italic as it was not internally calculated. The figure \n\ncomes from the Tremove model for the year of 2020.  \n \nThe following chart provides the calculated passenger mobility evolution from 2007 till 2020. \n\nParticularly for the case of high-speed rail, it was assumed the same 6% increase in its value, \nfrom 89bpkm to 94bpkm. \n\n \n\n\n\nDevelopment of 2020 scenarios \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  149 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 108 \u2013 [Future ] Expecte d passenger mobility de mand.  \n\n \n\nIt is possible to see that the passenger car will continue its dominant position as the major  \npassenger player. It is also expected that the aviation will reinforce its second position \nfollowed by the bus sector.  \n\nIt was calculated that the passenger mobility demand will increase from its level on 2007, \n6.899bpkm, to about 8.122bpkm by 2020, which represents an annual increase of about 1,4%.  \n\n \nReplacing the 2007 passenger mobility values by the 2020 ones on the reference case model, it \nwas possible to project a business as usual scenario for the tank-to-wheel energy consumption \n\nand CO2 emissions for the passenger mobility sector: \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 109 \u2013 [Future ] BAU e nergy for  passenger mobility. \n\n \n\n\n\nDevelopment of 2020 scenarios \n\n \n\n150 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nOn a business as usual scenario, the individual percentage increase on the energy consumption \n\nis directly proportional to the respective percentage increase on the passenger mobility \ndemand, as there are no  other external variables such as energy efficiency or other type of \n\nadditional measure. Due the different passenger mobility increases between all sub-modes of \ntransport, the global increase is influenced by the differences on the energy consumption per \npkm. That?s why the global increase on the energy for passenger mobility is about 23%, from \n\nthe level in 2007 of 10.420PJ to about 12.773PJ by 2020.  \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 110 \u2013 [Future ] BAU CO2 for passenger mobility.  \n\n \n \nThe same happens for the CO2 situation. Once it is a business as usual, it was assumed the \n\nsame biofuel energy blend as in 2007 (3% biodiesel and 1% bioethanol), and also the same \nshare of renewable electricity as in 2007, 16%. \n\nDue the expected increase on passenger mobility demand, an increase of about 23% on the \npassenger CO2 emissions was calculated, 736MtCO2 and 906MtCO2 for 2007 and 2020, \nrespectively. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nDevelopment of 2020 scenarios \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  151 \n\n \n\n5.1.2. Extreme modal-shift \n \nGiven the detail level of the developed transport model, it is possible to realize many and \n\ndifferent energy and CO2 assessments on the modal-shift variable. For instance, it is possible \nto evaluate the well-to-wheel energy and CO2 impacts resulting from the migration of \npassengers from bus into metro, from normal-speed running on diesel into car running on LPG, \n\nor for example from aviation into moto running on gasoline. \n \n\nFor purposes of this dissertation, focus was given to the passenger car segment and its energy \nand CO2 modal-shift impacts into other collective passenger transporters. It was decided to \ntest extreme well-to-wheel energy and CO2 impacts resulting from the full- migration of \n\npassengers travelling by car, into metro, into normal- and high-speed and into bus, according \nto each maximum seat capacity.  \n\n \nThe realization of an extreme full modal-shift scenario was considered on this dissertation as a \nmeaning of the maximum energy and CO2 well- to-wheel impacts that can be achieved given \n\nthe current European transport situation. For example, in the case of the bus segment, if no \nadditional extension on the maximum seat capacity, if no increase on the daily frequencies, or \n\nother type of measure, the bus segment is limited to carry a maximum number of passengers \nper vehicle, which was assumed on this dissertation as 60, as described on the Model \ndevelopment and calibration. The same happens for the other sub-modes. \n\n \n \n\nNote: many different scenarios could have been developed on the modal-shift variable but for \npurposes of this dissertation, it was decided to study in particular only the case of a full \nmaximum modal-shift from the passenger car segment into the collective transport modes, and \n\nnot study other modal-shifts scenarios. \n \n\n \n1. Calculate the maximum passenger mobility capacity for each sub-mode \n\n \n\nTo calculate the impacts from a full modal-shift it was necessary to first calculate the \nmaximum value of passenger mobility that can be transported by each analyzed sub- mode, and \n\nunderstand the potential capacity that each sub-mode can absorb from the car segment. \n \nThe following equation shows the calculation for the bus segment. I f in 2007 the bus sector \n\ntransported about 542bpkm with an average load factor of 33,5%, it means that at its \nmaximum load capacity (100%), it could potentially transport about 1.617bpkm.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nDevelopment of 2020 scenarios \n\n \n\n152 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nThis situation would represent the case that the all the bus services operating in the EU will be \n\nalways filled up, at a 100% occupancy rate factor. O f course it is clear that this situation is \nvery unlikely to happen, but for purposes of this dissertation it was required to study the \n\nextreme scenarios as a meaning of the maximum CO2 and energy reduction that is possible to \nachieve given the current capacity of those collective modes.  \n \n\n \n2. Calculate the additional passenger mobility capacity for each sub-mode \n\n \nHaving previously calculated the maximum passengers-km capacity, the additional capacity \nthat the bus segment can receive is the difference between the maximum capacity and the \n\ncurrent situation (2007): \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \nThis means that the bus sub-mode has the additional capacity to receive about 1.074bpkm, \n\nfrom any other sub- mode of transport.  \n \nThe same methodology was applied to the other sub- modes of interest in this exercise (metro, \n\nnormal-speed and high-speed). Table 56 summarizes the current passengers-km situation, the \nmaximum passengers-km and the additional that is possible to receive.  \n\n \nTable 56 \u2013 [Future ] Addi tional passengers -km capacity by sub-mode. \n\nbpkm Eurostat 2007 Maximum Additional \n\nBus 542 1.617 1.074 \n\nMetro 86 246 160 \n\nNormal-speed 395 1.079 684 \n\nHigh-speed 89 129 40 \n\nTOTAL 1.112 3.071 1.959 \n\n \n \n\nThis table can confirm two main important things: first the current lower usage of the public \nand collective transport modes which implies a large additional capacity possible to be filled \nup; secondly even if all of these sub- modes of transport would be filled up (100% occupancy \n\nrate), they could not absorb the passenger mobility demand currently performed by the \npassenger car: 4.760bpkm.  \n\n \nIn order to provide visual information, the following chart represents the situation of the \nprevious table: \n\n \n\n\n\nDevelopment of 2020 scenarios \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  153 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 111 \u2013 [Future ] Current and additi onal pk m c apacity of i nland modes. \n\n \n\n \nVisually it is possible to confirm the important additional absolute capacity that is possible to \nabsorb by the sub- modes of normal-speed train and bus. \n\n \nFinally, it is now possible to compare the well-to-wheel energy and the CO2 emissions \nvariations resulting from the increase in the modal-shift from the passenger car into the \n\npreviously calculated four sub- modes of transport. Individual and agglomerated results are \nshowed in the next chart with the respective co mparison with the current (2007) passenger \n\ntransport situation: \n \n \n\n \nFigure 112 \u2013 [Future ] Energy modal-shift i mpac ts from passenger car. \n\n \n \n\nOn a global scale, a full modal-shift from passenger car into these four analyzed transport sub-\nmodes could potentially reach a tank-to-wheel energy consumption reduction of about 16%, \nfrom the level of 10.420PJ to 8.725PJ, and a well- to-wheel reduction of about 11%, from \n\n12.512PJ to 11.125PJ.  \n\n\n\nDevelopment of 2020 scenarios \n\n \n\n154 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nThe great availability of free capacity on the sub- modes of normal-speed rail and bus largely \n\ncontributes for this reduction potential, while the current lower seat capacity of metro and \nhigh-speed rail does not offer such a large potential of reducing the energy consumption.  \n\n \nIn a particular scale, all these four sub- modes of transport show a lower ta nk-to-wheel energy \nconsumption per pkm when compared to the passenger car, which means higher energy \n\nefficiency. Additionally, it should be present that as much as the number of pkm number \nincreases on these fo ur sub- modes, its energy efficiency per pkm increases, always favouring \n\nthe modal-shift. It is therefore a cyclic positive effect. \n \n \n\n \nFigure 113 \u2013 [Future ] CO2 modal-shift impac ts from passenger car. \n\n \n\n \nCompared to the energy effect, the CO2 reduction effect from modal-shift is even larger due \nthe higher contribution from the electric modes such as metro, normal-speed and high-speed \n\nrail, once they present 0gCO2/pkm on a tank-to-wheel basis.  \nGlobally, it could be potentially possible to reach a tank-to-wheel CO2 reduction of about \n\n19%, from the level of 736MtCO2 to 593MtCO2, and a well-to-wheel reduction of about 15%, \nfrom the level of 894MtCO2 to 762MtCO2. \nSimilarly to the energy situation, the same effect happens with the CO2 emissions. As much as \n\nthe passenger mobility increases on these modes, its CO2 emissions factor per pkm reduces, \nand consequently increasing the modal-shift reduction effect. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nDevelopment of 2020 scenarios \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  155 \n\n \n\n5.1.3. High-speed rail infrastructure \n \nUnder the Trans-European Networks for Transport, re- launched by the Lisbon Treaty, it is \n\nexpected a large deployment and implementation of more high-speed lines into the European \nUnion transport network  for the decade to come [52]. These high-speed lines are expected \nallowing the migration of longer journeys between city centres, mainly performed by aviation \n\nand passenger cars, into high-speed trains. These journeys are commonly known by long-\ndistances trips between city centres, at the member state or intra-EU level. \n\n \n \n\n1. Find the expected future high-speed rail infrastructure \n\n \nTo evaluate the energy and CO2 impacts resulting from its deployment, it was necessary to \n\nfirst represent the expected future picture on high-speed infrastructure. The information of the \nnew high-speed lines that are expected to be completed by 2020 was collected, and then \npredict a likely passenger mobility demand and seat capacity that potentially exist by 2020.  \n\nTo start, Table 57 shows a summary of the kilometres already constructed, on going, a nd the \nwhen each project will be completed.  \n\n \nTable 57 \u2013 [Future ] Future high-s pee d lines  [52]. \n\nkm Region Completed On-going Remaining \n\nPP1 South 1.242 424 717 \nPP2 North 927 5 0 \n\nPP3 South 1.302 471 1.883 \nPP4 East 377 141 61 \nPP6 Centre 234 237 1.167 \n\nPP17 Centre 525 289 565 \nPP19 South 995 1.431 2.304 \n\nPP24 Centre 922 348 859 \nPP28 Centre 77 180 140 \n\nSub-total \nEU27 \n\n6.601 3.526 7.696 \n\nTOTAL 17.823 \n\nNote: \n\nPP1 = A xis Berlin-Verona/Milano-Bologna-Napoli-Messina-Pale rmo  \n\nPP2 = A xis Paris -Bru xe lles/Brussel-Koln-A msterdam-London \n\nPP3 = A xis Southwest Europe (Lisbon -Madrid) \n\nPP4 = A xis East Europe (Pa ris -Baudrecourt/Paris -Metz-Fran kfurt/ Lu xe mbourg)  \n\nPP6 = A xis Lyon-Trieste-Divaca/Koper-Divaca-Ljubljana-Budapest-Ukra inian border \n\nPP17 = A xis Pa ris -St rasbourg-Stuttgart-Wien-Brat islava \n\nPP19 = A xis Iberian Pen insula \n\nPP24 = A xis Lyon/Genova-Basel-Du isburg-Rotterdam/Antwerpen \n\nPP28 = A xis Brussels -Lu xe mbourg-Strasbourg \n\n \nThere are 30 priority projects that are previewed by the TEN -T and are expected to be in place \n\nby the year of 2020-2025. From these 30, about 22 involve the construction or upgrad e of rail \nlines, and the remaining 8 refer to road motorways, motorways of the sea, or other type of \n\n\n\nDevelopment of 2020 scenarios \n\n \n\n156 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nprojects. From those 22 rail priority projects, 9 involve the construction of high-speed lines \n\nand are those which are presented on the previous figure.  \n \n\nOn this dissertation is not the objective to study the progression status of each priority project \nor the projects country by country, but to study the agglomerated EU picture. From the \ncollection of the data, it was possible to conclude that about 6.601km of high-speed lines are \n\nalready in function, with about 11.222km remaining to be completed by 2020. With all high-\nspeed projects completed, it is expected that will exist about 17.823km of high-speed lines in \n\nthe EU, which represents an increase of 170% respecting the current situation.  \nAs an example, the PP2 represents one of the oldest high-speed lines in the EU, the line \nbetween Paris-Brussels, with its latest expansion into Amsterdam and Koln, while the PP3 \n\nrepresents the Iberian high-speed line, which is expected to link Lisbon to Madrid and to the \nrest of the EU. \n\n \n \n\n2. Find the expected future high-speed rail passenger mobility \n\n \nFor calculating the expected passenger mobility demand that might exist by 2020, a very \n\nsimple methodology was used. It was decided to calculate a mobility- infrastructure factor \nwhich means the number of passengers-km per km of completed high-speed line, and then \napply it to the expected kilometres by 2020. For the current situation, comes: \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \nThis means that, in average, about 13 thousand passengers travelled per km and per year \nwithin the already constructed high-speed lines. For 2020, it was assumed to use the same \n\nmobility- infrastructure factor and project a likely 2020 passenger mobility demand: \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \nBefore continuing, it should be clear that it was not taken into consideration neither the \n\nnumber of high-speed rail operators, the potential new services that might appear, or any study \nof popularity of high-speed lines according to the region or country acceptance. In the reality, \nit is likely to happen an increase on the number of high-speed services in a larger proportion \n\nthan the increase on kilometres of lines. This exercise was realized under the assumption that \nthe increase on passenger mobility could be directly proportional to the available infrastructure.  \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nDevelopment of 2020 scenarios \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  157 \n\n \n\nSimilarly to the previously exercise, the following equations shows the calculation of the \n\nmaximum passengers-km capacity expected by 2020. It is used the current load factor of the \nhigh-speed lines (68,7%) and the likely passenger mobility demand by 2020 for the high-speed \n\nrail segment: \n \n\n  \n\n \n \n\nThis corresponds to an additional capacity of about 260bpkm: \n \n\n  \n\n \n \n\n3. Presentation of results \n \n\nFor the presentation of the well-to-wheel energy and CO2 impacts res ulting from a modal-\nshift into the high-speed rail segment, it was decided to study only the long distance transport \nservices. It means that it was only assessed on the modal-shift from aviation, from normal-\n\nspeed long distance, from bus long distance and passenger car long distance.  \nThe following chart attempts to represent the potential well-to-wheel energy and CO2 impacts: \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure 114 \u2013 [Future ] Energy i mpacts due  more  high-s pee d lines. \n\n \n \n\nThe calculation of the energy well-to-wheel impact was interesting. From the calculations, \nboth due either the higher average tank-to-wheel energy consumption per pkm of normal-\n\nspeed and bus, or either the lower number of long-distance passengers-km transported, the \ntank-to-wheel effect of modal-shift from these two modes into high-speed rail is about -0%, a \nslight decrease. It means that there is no big energy reduction resulting of a modal-shift from \n\nthose modes into the high-speed segment. \n\n\n\nDevelopment of 2020 scenarios \n\n \n\n158 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \n\nOn the case of higher tank-to-wheel energy consumers per pkm, such as aviation and \npassenger car, the effect is considerable high, -6% for aviation and -3% for passenger car. On \n\nthe well-to-wheel side, it was calculated as potentially possible to reach a -5% if a modal-shift \nfrom aviation and -2% if from passenger car. \n \n\n \nFigure 115 \u2013 [Future ] CO2 i mpacts due more high-s pee d lines. \n\n \n \n\nThe CO2 profile is similar to the energy one : lower reductions if modal-shift from normal-\nspeed rail and bus, and higher effects if modal-shift from aviation and passenger cars. O n the \n\ntank-to-wheel basis, a potential 7% CO2 emissions reduction is reachable if there is a \nmigration from aviation into high-speed, and 4% reduction if from passenger car.  \n \n\nThese are the potential energy and CO2 effects o f a modal-shift given the current perspectives \nof high- speed lines infrastructures by 2020. O n a global scale, the potential reduction is very \n\nsmall mainly due the lower EU seat capacity of the high-speed rail sector which is not enough \nto absorb the high amount of passengers-km currently travelling on the other sub- modes. \nHowever, it should be remembered that the effect in terms of energy and CO2 per pkm is \n\nmuch larger. \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nDevelopment of 2020 scenarios \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  159 \n\n \n\n5.2. Technical measures \n \nUnder the technical measures previously mentioned is the expected improvement on energy \n\nefficiency, the uptake of renewable energies such as biofuels and renewable electricity, and \nthe uptake of electric vehicles.  \n \n\n \n\n5.2.1. Energy efficiency \n \nWithin all the potential energy efficiencies that might represent a large influence on the total \n\nenergy consumption and CO2 emissions, is the energy efficiency expected by the car segment. \nAs a major energy consumer and CO2 intense sector, the car segment offers the largest \npotential to contribute with energy efficiency improvements for the global reduction of \n\ntransport?s energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Other sub- modes of transport such as \naviation and the bus segment also expect to reduce its average fleet energy efficiency.  \n\n \nIt was decided for the other sub- modes such as the metro, the normal- and high-speed sector, \nthat its energy efficiency would not considerable improve during the period between 2007 and \n\n2020, based on the assumption that the long- life age of the rail fleet together with the low \nreplacement rate do not allow for a considerable energy efficiency improvement. \n\n  \n \n\n1. Find the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency reductions \n\n \nFor doing so, and as similarly realized on the Model development and calibration, the \u201cJEC \nBiofuels programme\u201d presents their own estimations on the expected energy efficiency \n\nimprovements for the car segment. O nce more, and in spite of the attended internal meetings  \nat Toyota Motor Europe, it is not possible to provide the exact details of the expected \n\nimprovements, being possible only to provide a gene ral value which represents the major \nmessage on the average energy efficiency improvements of the car fleet, considered as \nrepresentative for purposes of this dissertation. \n\n \nThe average energy efficiency that is required for purposes of this dissertation is not the \n\naverage energy efficiency of the vehicle stock, but the average energy efficiency of the current \nsituation, taking into account the current profile patterns usage. As an example, if only newer \ncars were running, the real average energy efficiency would be very lower when compared to \n\nthe stock energy efficiency, which would include the older cars that are not running.  \nThis consideration might be out of range if is taken into account all the assumptions behind \n\nhowever, mathematically and conceptually, this difference can potentially be a source of \ninfluence for the results.  \n \n\nAs a brief reminder of the \u201cJEC biofuels assumptions\u201d, the calculation of the car fleet energy \nefficiency improvements bases itself on three main pillars: improvements on the energy \n\n\n\nDevelopment of 2020 scenarios \n\n \n\n160 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nefficiency of the new car sales, the scrap rate of older vehicles, and the annual mileage \n\naccording to the average age of cars and engine type.  \nAs a general result of the \u201cJEC biofuel programme \u201d, it was obtained that the average car fleet \n\nefficiency is expected to improve about 26 % in 13 years, from 2007 till 2020, which means an \nannual improvement of about 2% [12].  \nFor purposes of this dissertation, it was not made any differentiation between the expected \n\nenergy efficiency improvements according to the engine type, being assumed the same value \nof 2% for the four engine types considered in 2007 (gasoline, diesel, LPG and CNG).  \n\n \nIn order for giving an energy efficiency considerations for the other relevant sub -modes of \npassenger transport, such as bus and passenger vans, an annual average energy efficiency \n\nimprovement of about 1,45% was assumed, as described on the \u201cJEC Biofuel programme \u201d for \nthe heavy duty sector [12]. This means a global improvement of about 19% from 2007 till \n\n2020.  \nIn the case of the aviation sector, the International Air Transport Association expects to reach \nan annual energy efficiency improvements of about 1,5%, which means a global reduction of \n\nabout 20% till 2020 [53]. \n \n\nTable 58 summarizes the annual tank-to-wheel energy efficiency improvements assumed on \nthis dissertation for each fleet sub-mode: \n \n\nTable 58 \u2013 [Future ] TTW  energy e fficienc y i mpr ove me nts.  \n\n Annual improvement Global improvement (2007-2020) \n\nAviation 1,5% 20% \n\nBus 1,45% 19% \n\nCar 2% 26% \n\nVan 1,45% 19% \n\n \n\n \n2. Presentation of results \n\n \nThe following charts resume the tank-to-wheel and well-to-wheel energy and CO2 effects \nresulting from the improvements on the energy efficiency. Individual and the agglomerated \n\nresults are shown for the passenger mobility segment.  \n\n\n\nDevelopment of 2020 scenarios \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  161 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 116 \u2013 [Future ] Energy efficiency i mpr ove ments impacts.  \n\n \n \n\nThe chart confirms the large potential of the car segment to reduce the overall passenger \ntransport energy consumption, which largely contributes to the scenario in case of all \nimprovements. In this case, the energy reduction represents the same percentage decrease as \n\nthe assumed percentage on energy efficiency improvement, once neither the passengers-km \nactivity, neither the occupancy rate, and others, was changed.  \n\n \nIn this scenario, it could be potentially achievable a reduction from the level of tank -to-wheel \nfrom 10.420PJ in 2007, into a level of 7.999PJ, and well-to-wheel from 12.512PJ into 9.718PJ.  \n\n \nThe following chart presents the same profile reductions in terms of CO2 emissions.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 117 \u2013 [Future ] CO2 efficiency i mprove ments impacts. \n\n \n \n\nOnce more, given the high importance of the car segment, its energy efficiency improvements \noffer the largest potential to reduce the passenger transport CO2 emissions.

Biofuels \n \nIn order to calculate the well- to-wheel energy and CO2 impacts resulting from the single \n\nuptake of biofuels, it was decided to use the biofuel blend mixture that came from the analysis \nof the National Renewable Energy Action Plans (NREAPs), presented in Annexes.

Here, the biofuel effect was tested both on the \npassenger road and passenger rail diesel, as this last one can also potentially consume \n\nbiodiesel. \n \nAs reminder information and as previously mentioned, the consumption of biofuels has the \n\nhigh potential of reducing the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions (tank-to-wheel is zero) but given \nthe current lower development state of its production technology, it presents a potentially \n\nincrease on the well-to-tank energy consumption and CO2 emissions. \nThe following charts provide the comparison between the reference case of 2007 and the \nscenario if NREAPs biofuels are in place.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 118 \u2013 [Future ] NREAPs biofuels energy i mpacts.  \n\n \n \n\nAs a result from the assumption of no differences on the comb ustion efficiency between \nbiofuels and fossil fuels, the calculations presents a 0% tank-to-wheel energy variation. O n the \nother hand, the well-to-wheel energy consumption can potentially increase from the 2007 level \n\nof 12.512PJ to the level of 13.296PJ, which represents a global increase of 6%. \n \n\nGenerally, the consumption of biofuels will always provide an increase on the well- to-wheel \nenergy consumption given its higher energy- intensive production process. As additional \ninformation, the well- to-wheel energy impact can vary according to the considered biofuel \n\ncrop or industrial process. For instance, considering biodiesel from rapeseed will present a \ndifferent well- to-wheel energy consumption when compared to biodiesel from soya beans [24]. \n\nOn this dissertation, it is not the objective of individually study each well- to-wheel energy \nvariation according to the crop but, given the developed prediction tool, it is also possible to \nplay with these variables and study this particular effect.  \n\n \n\n\n\nDevelopment of 2020 scenarios \n\n \n\n164 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 119 \u2013 [Future ] NREAPs biofuels CO2 i mpac ts. \n\n \n\n \nThe published biofuels predicted by the NREAPs have the potential to reduce the passenger \ntransport tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions from the level of 736MtCO2 to 691MtCO2, which \n\nrepresents a reduction of 6%. O n the well-to-wheel basis, the biofuels could potentially reduce \nthe overall CO2 emissions by 3%, from the 2007 level of 894MtCO2 to 867MtCO2. \n\n \nOnce more, and similarly to the energy situation, the CO2 well-to-wheel variations highly \ndepends on the assumed biofuel origin or crop. For example, the bioethanol pathway assumed \n\non this dissertation corresponds to the sugar cane coming from Brazil, which under the \nrenewable energy directive, presents one of the lowest factors in terms of gCO2 per MJ.  \n\n \n \n\n5.2.3. Electric vehicles \n \nCurrently, the usage of electricity as energy carrier for transport is only being performed by \n\nthe rail sector, in the forms of metro, normal- and high-speed rail. In spite of the recent \npopularity gained by the electric vehicles segment, it was interesting to evaluate the potential \n\nCO2 reductions resulting from the replacement of conventional internal combustion engines \nby electrified ones. Conceptually, the migration into electric vehicles offers a 100% reduction \non the tank-to-wheel emissions, and a lower (between 0-100%) on the well- to-wheel \n\nemissions. \n \nWith the deployment of the renewable electricity sector expected by the National Renewable \n\nEnergy Action Plans, the potential CO2 reduction resulting from the usage of electricity in the \ntransport sector, both in forms of the rail sector and electric vehicles, is even larger. \n\nAdditionally, with the expected expansion on the high-speed sector, the potential absorption of \n\n\n\nDevelopment of 2020 scenarios \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  165 \n\n \n\npassengers-km into a more renewable electricity energy carrier offers an interesting potential \n\nto tackle transport emissions.  \nRenewable electricity \n\nFrom the analysis of the National Renewable Energy Action P lans presented in Annexes, it \nwas calculated that an increase from 16% into 36% on the renewable electricity share by 2020 \nis potentially achievable, which means a reduction from the factor of 115gCO2/MJ into about \n\n89gCO2/MJ of electricity produced.  \n \n\n \nFigure 120 \u2013 [Future ] Expecte d rene wable electricity situati on by 2020. \n\n \n\n \nHaving in mind the past results on the modal-shift from the passenger car into the electrified \n\nrail sector, it was considered as not such important the CO2 reductions due the deployment of \nrenewable electricity, due the lower usage of electricity for passenger mobility. It is known \nthat a slight increase on the CO2 reduction will happen but given its lower amount of \n\npassengers-km, it was decided to not reproduce newer pictures of that situation.  \nIn spite of this factor, the following analysis will only focus on the expected penetration of \n\nelectric vehicles on the passenger car segment, and its potential reduction due the deployment \nof the expected renewable electricity segment by the National Renewable Energy Action Plans.  \n \n\n \nElectric vehicles \n\nResulting from the analysis of the NREAPs, the electric vehicles segment is expected to \nconstitute about 9,5% of the car fleet by 2020.

Electric vehicle well-to-wheel impacts with 16% renewable electricity share \n \n\nOn a first calculation, it is realized an individual analysis between all main urban sub- modes in \norder to compare the individual energy and CO2 well-to-wheel impacts resulting from a \nmodal-shift into electric vehicles. Here, it should be mentioned the conditions behind this \n\ncalculation. \n \n\nIt was decided to always kept the same passenger mobility demand as a boundary condition of \nthese calculations, as well as the 2007 passenger-km performed by the other engine types.  \nAlso here, once the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions from electric vehicles were considered as 0 \n\non this dissertation, it is expectable that the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions of the passenger car \nsegment will always remain the same as the 2007 in case of a modal-shift from other modes \n\ninto passenger car electric vehicle segment.  \n \nWith these assumptions, it was possible to calculate the impact only due the migration of \n\npassengers-km into electric vehicles, fixing the rest of the other components. \nThe following charts attempt to provide a potential energy and CO2 variations resulting from \n\nthe individual migrations: \n \n\n \nFigure 121 \u2013 [Future ] Electric ve hicle energy i mpacts.  \n\n \n \nFor this evaluation, it was necessary to assume a tank-to-wheel energy consumption for \n\nelectric vehicles, which was about 150W h/km [51]. After applying the methodology used on \nthe Model development and calibration  for the electric drive modes, it was possible to \n\nconclude that the electric vehicle well-to-wheel energy consumption in terms of energy per \npkm is about 1MJ/pkm. \n \n\nAccording to the 2007 model, the value of 1MJ/pkm appears as considerable lower to the \nvalue of metro (1,6MJ/pkm), but very similar to the values of normal-speed rail (1,1MJ/pkm) \n\nand bus (0,9MJ/pkm). This is one of the factors that influence the lower energy variatio n for \nthese sub-modes of transport, together with the fact that a lower number of passengers-km are \n\n\n\nDevelopment of 2020 scenarios \n\n \n\n168 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nshifted. In the case of bus, there is a slight increase (0,1%) on the well- to-wheel energy \n\nconsumption. \nAs expected, the case of passenger car is the one that shows the largest variation, once the \n\ncalculated well-to-wheel energy consumption per pkm was about 1,7MJ/pkm.  \n \nIn a scenario where the main passengers-km performed in urban areas (excluding motos and \n\npassenger vans) are shifted into electric vehicles, a potential 36% reduction on the tank-to-\nwheel energy consumption is achievable, from the 2007 level of 10.420PJ into 6.723PJ. The \n\nrespective well-to-wheel energy reduction can amount to 17%, from 12.512PJ to 10.538PJ.  \n \nOn the likely real 2020 scenario for electric vehicles, the NREAPs situation, it was calculated \n\nthat the tank-to-wheel energy consumption could potential reduce about 5%, to the level of \n9.876PJ, with the respective well-to-wheel reduction of about 3%, to the level of 12.159PJ.  \n\n \nThe following chart provides the CO2 well-to-wheel impacts. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 122 \u2013 [Future ] Electric ve hicle CO2 i mpac ts. \n\n \n \nResulting from the tank-to-wheel energy consumption previously assumed for electric vehicles, \n\nit results on a well-to-wheel CO2 efficiency per pkm of about 40gCO2/pkm. In this case, this \nfactor is the lowest when compared to the four analyzed sub- modes of metro (63gCO2/pkm), \n\nnormal-speed rail (52gCO2/pkm), bus (69gCO2/pkm) and passenger car (129gCO2/pkm). \nThat?s why the percentage CO2 well-to-wheel impacts are higher when compared to the \nenergy ones. \n\n \nA migration from metro into electric vehicles could potential reduce the well- to-wheel CO2 \n\nemissions on about 0,2% (once the tank-to-wheel remains 0), the case of a migration from \nnormal-speed rail it could be possible to reduce about 0,2% (due the larger amount of \npassengers-km and the diesel effect), and from bus about 4% on the tank-to-wheel and 2% on \n\nthe well- to-wheel. \n \n\n\n\nDevelopment of 2020 scenarios \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  169 \n\n \n\nThe passenger car potential CO2 reduction is the highest, as expected. Both due the large \n\namount of passengers-km on urban areas, as well as the higher CO2 efficiency factor per pkm, \na shift into electric vehicles could potentially reduce the passengers transport tank-to-wheel \n\nemissions in about 40%, from the 2007 level of 736MtCO2 to 424MtCO2, and a well-to-\nwheel reduction of about 29%, from the 2007 level of 894MtCO2 to 639MtCO2. \n \n\nA full uptake of electric vehicles in urban areas, excluding moto and passenger vans, offers the \npotential of reducing the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions in about 46% and the well-to-wheels in \n\nabout 31%. Remember that the effect could be potentially higher if passenger vans would be \nalso included. \n \n\nThe NREAPs uptake of electric vehicles on the passenger car segment can potentially reduce \nthe passenger transport tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions in about 7%, to 687MtCO2, and the \n\nwell-to-wheels in about 5%, to 850MtCO2. \nOnce this case was considered the real one for purposes of this dissertation, as it represents the \nresults of the analysis of each me mber state report, it is now assessed the CO2 impacts if the \n\nexpected renewable electricity by the NREAPs is implemented.  \n \n\n \n2. Electric vehicle well-to-wheel impacts with 36% renewable electricity share \n\n \n\nThe following chart, shows the scenarios if the renewab le electricity increases from 16% to \n36%, in the case of the extreme scenario of all urban areas shift into electric vehicles, as well \n\nas the NREAP scenario of 9,5% of passenger car segment.  \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 123 \u2013 [Future ] Rene wable  electricity i mpact. \n\n \n \n\nGiven the current situation in 2007, the single deployment of renewable electricity from 16% \nrenewable into 36%, can potentially reduce in about 1% the well-to-wheel reduction, mainly \n\nsupported by the normal-speed sector (the largest passenger-km mode running on electricity). \n \n\n\n\nDevelopment of 2020 scenarios \n\n \n\n170 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nTheoretically, as much as the penetration of electricity as energy carrier for transport increases, \n\nits CO2 reduction effect also increases. O n a scenario of full uptake of electric vehicles in \nurban areas, the CO2 reduction effect resulting from the deployment of renewable electricity \n\ninto 36% renewable, can potentially offer a n additional 5% CO2 reduction when compared to \nthe case of 2007, where was about 16% share.  \nIn the considered real case, the N REAPs, the deplo yment of renewable electricity can \n\npotentially additional reduce in about 1% the well-to-wheel CO2 emissions.  \n \n\n \n\n5.3. Final scenario \n \n\nThe development of a final scenario for the passenger mobility scene will rely on six main \npillars: the expected 2020 increase o n passenger mobility demand, the deployment of new \n\nhigh-speed rail infrastructures, the expected improvements on energy efficiency, the projected \nbiofuels, the renewable electricity share and electric vehicles both from the National \nRenewable Energy Action Plans. On the case of modal-shift, no scenario was made once it is \n\nalready being assumed the passenger mobility for each transport sub- mode. \n \n\nThe following chart shows the well-to-wheel energy impacts resulting from the uptake of the \nmost likely analyzed variables: \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 124 \u2013 [Future ] Energy final 2020 scenario.  \n\n \n \nConsidering all the technical and non-technical variables previously mentioned, it is \n\npotentially possible to reduce the tank-to-wheel energy consumption by 10% compared to the \nreference case, and about 2 % in a well-to-wheel basis. The low percentage well- to-wheel \n\n\n\nDevelopment of 2020 scenarios \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  171 \n\n \n\nenergy reduction compared to the tank-to-wheel is influenced both by the uptake of biofuels \n\nand an additional increase on the usage of electricity.  \n \n\nHowever, the potential CO2 reductions are higher, as showed in Figure 125.  \n\n \nFigure 125 \u2013 [Future ] CO2 fi nal 2020 scenario.  \n\n \n \n\nOn the CO2 perspective, a potential tank-to-wheel CO2 reduction of about 16% is likely to be \npossible to happen, together with a 12% reduction on the well-to-wheel basis. Here, the usage \n\nof biofuels and electricity high influence the tank-to-wheel. \n\n\n\n \n\n172 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  173 \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 6 \n\nRESULTS AND \n\nDISCUSSIONS \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n174 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and discussions \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  175 \n\n \n\n6. Results and discussions \n \n\n6.1. Case study results \n \n\n6.1.1. Rail \n \n\n1. The accuracy of the Ex-Tremis model \n \n\nThe comparison between the Ex-Tremis with the Eurostat data showed that are large \ndifferences on both the diesel and electricity consumption. The exercise of interact the Ex-\n\nTremis data with the one published by the Eurostat allowed also discovering that might exist \nlarge discrepancies and might be obtained values that are out of range when it regards to the \ntank-to-wheel energy efficiencies.  \n\n \n  \n\n2. High-speed \n \nFor example in the case of the high-speed segment, the calculation of a tank-to-wheel energy \n\nefficiency from the Ex-Tremis resulted in a value of 1,72MJ/km, largely different  (variation of \n98%) from the one coming from the INRETS study. It was necessary to search within the \n\nliterature for typical tank-to-wheel energy consumption values for the most common high-\nspeed rail services in Europe. This allowed a better characterization of the high-speed rail \nsegment in both energy consumption and occupancy rate.  \n\n \n \n\n3. Metro \n \nOther example was the calculation of the metro tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm. In \n\nthis case, using external data sources for the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per km it was \nconcluded that the occupancy rate was largely influencing the results. This fact was confirmed \n\nwhen it was compared with the values for tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm coming \nfrom other studies on the topic, which said that the occupancy rate should be different.  \n \n\n \n4. Normal-speed \n\n \nThe construction of the normal-speed rail details was realized on the opposite way as for the \nmetro/tram and high-speed.  \n\nOnce it was already calculated the total tank-to-wheel energy for the passenger rail segment, \nthe energy for metro/tram and high-speed was subtracted, resulting in the remaining quantities \n\nfor the normal-speed segment, being not necessary the introduction of the tank-to-wheel \nenergy efficiency per km or per pkm.  \n\n\n\nResults and discussions \n\n \n\n176 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nAlso as opposition to the other rail modes, the reliance of the normal-speed segment in two \n\nenergy carriers, diesel and electricity, did not help in dividing the Eurostat passenger mobility \nby energy type.  \n\nIt should be clear that these factors were a very potential source of errors in what regards the \nvalidation of the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per km and per pkm.  \n \n\nThe input of the Tremove?s passenger mobility rail details was the considered way to use a \nrepresentative European model for transport to help dividing the passengers-km from diesel to \n\nelectricity.  \nAs a result, it was obtained that the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm was in line with \nseveral studies on the topic, which was a very good result in terms of validating the rail \n\nsegment. However, the calculation of the occupancy rate with the objective of validating the \ntank-to-wheel energy efficiency per km was also a delicate step. \n\n \nIt should be very clear that the calculation of an average European occupancy rate for the \nnormal-speed segment was not an easy task to perform. Introducing a value that represents the \n\naverage European number of passengers per train needs to be carefully considered as it will \nlargely influence the validation of the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per km.  \n\n \nIn other hand, the current data on this matter is very critical in what regards data protection, \nconfidentiality matters, policy restrictions, etc. When searching for values on occupancy rate, \n\nthe major representative associations such as the International Union of Railways (UIC), the \nEuropean Rail Industry (UNIFE), clearly announced the need to pay a certain amount of \n\nmoney to consult their annual reports and have data.  \nIn that case, it was decided to search for other studies on the topic. It was decided to collect \nvalues in such a way that allowed the definition of potential boundaries and to have a \n\nrepresentative average value. For example, whether Wikipedia is a reliable source or not, it \nannounces average seat capacity of 800seats/train, which was out of order (+200%) when \n\ncompared to the used sources (average 263seats/train).  \n \n \n\n5. Conclusions \n \n\nOnce the rail segment was completed and with all mathematical relations defined, it was \npossible to test the influence of main problematic assumed values on the remaining ones. Once \nthe model is mathematically related in all of its components, changing the major problematic \n\nvalues will result on a change in the other related values.  \n \n\nFor example, one of the doubts firstly found was the average occupancy rate of the metro or its \ntank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm.  \nIn the way that the model was developed, changing the metro occupancy rate will directly \n\ninfluence the total tank-to-wheel electricity consumption of the normal-speed segment, which \nwill influence its average tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per pkm and per pkm.  \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and discussions \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  177 \n\n \n\nIncreasing the metro?s occupancy rate from 26 to its initial value of 91passengers/vehic le \n\n(+250%), resulted in an increase of the total tank-to-wheel electricity consumed by the \nnormal-speed from 112PJ to 143PJ (+28%), and its respective tank-to-wheel energy efficiency \n\nper km from 33 to 42MJ/km (+31%). This happens since it was considered as constant the \ntank-to-wheel energy per km.  \nThere is therefore a potential influence on the rail segment. Here, and once the calculated \n\ntank-to-wheel energy efficiency of 32M/km was in line with the sources, the normal-speed \noccupancy rate would theoretically reduce from 96 to 74 (-23%). \n\n \n \n\n6. Results \n\n \nAll the assumptions and calculations allowed discovering that the normal-speed segment is \n\nresponsible for about 79% of the total well-to-wheel energy consumption by the rail sector, \nwhich amounted to about 977PJ. The metro and the high-speed segments were responsible for \nthe remaining 14% and 7%, respectively.  \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure 126 \u2013 [Results] Rail WTW energ y distri bution.  \n\n \nThe inner ring shows that the normal-speed segment is responsible for abo ut 79% of the total \n\nwell-to-wheel energy consumption calculated on this chapter, with the remaining 14% for \nmetro and 7% for the high-speed rail segment.  \nFrom the second ring, it is possible to visualize the large importance of the normal-speed \n\nelectricity consumption on the well-to-tank basis (44%), followed by the normal-speed tank-\nto-wheel (19%), and by the normal-speed diesel tank-to-wheel (14%). \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and discussions \n\n \n\n178 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 127 \u2013 [Results] Rail WTW CO2 distri bution.  \n\n \n \nThe inner ring shows that about 82% of the well- to-wheel CO2 emissions on the rail sector are \n\nemitted by the normal-speed segment, followed by the metro with 12% and 6% for the high-\nspeed rail segment. \n\nFrom the second ring, it is possible to see the large contribution both form the normal-speed \ndiesel tank-to-wheel (22%) and the normal-speed electricity well-to-tank (55%). \n \n\n \n\n6.1.2. Road \n \n\n1. The accuracy of the Tremove model  \n \n\nThe Tremove model is one of the most complete road fleet databases at the European level. It \nprovides detailed fleet composition in what regards to number of vehicles, by age, by power \n\nengine, by energy type, etc, by the sub-modes of bus, car, passenger van, moto and freight \ntransport. Also, it provides information on the total ta nk-to-wheel energy consumption divided \nby the passenger mobility demand.  \n\n \nIn spite of its development year, about 1995-2000, it presents several negative points in what \n\nregards its accuracy. Large differences on the individual quantities of gasoline and diesel when \ncompared to the Eurostat, which influences the gasoline differences on the car segment \nconsists in a big error if it is required to study the road mode and its sub-modes. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and discussions \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  179 \n\n \n\n2. The need to use the \u201cJEC Biofuel Programme\u201d  \n\n \nThe need to better characterize the road segment lead to the consultation of the \u201cJEC Biofuel \n\nProgramme\u201d. Its energy quantities were considered as highly representative once they were \nthe result of an integrated work from the vehicle fleet composition development, annual \nstatistics on total travel mileage, as well as fuel consumption. Additionally (and of especial \n\ninterest on this dissertation), the JEC quantities are in line with the ones coming from the \nEurostat, with a global error of about 1,5%.  \n\nThis allowed the consideration of the \u201cJEC Biofuel Programme\u201d as a very reliab le source. \n \n \n\n2.1.Car \n\n \n\nOnce coming from the \u201cJEC Biofuel Programme\u201d, the car tank-to-wheel energy quantities \nwere accepted as they were received.  \nThe characterization of the energy and CO2 efficiencies at the car segment relied on the \n\nequation system that was developed to find the energy efficiency differences, as well as the \npassenger mobility demand by energy type.  \n\nThis methodology was developed in such a way to mathematically relate all variables and, for \nexample, to project individual higher improvements on one vehicle powertrain compared to \nother. Additionally, and not studied in this dissertation but as motivation behind, it was \n\ndeveloped to test the influence of the number of vehicles per powertrain with the respective \nimprovements on energy efficiency. That would allow the single manipulation of each \n\nparameter and test the total tank-to-wheel energy and CO2 impact.  \n \nThe calculation of the value of occupancy rate as a result from the Eurostat?s passenger \n\nmobility and the \u201cJEC \u201d annual mileage in km was viewed as the correct and exact way to \nmathematically relate these two quantities. It resulted in an average occupancy rate for  the \n\nEuropean Union level in the same value as the European Energy Agency publication.  \n \n \n\n2.2.Remaining road energy \n\n \n\nThe remaining road total tank-to-wheel energy quantities resulted from the subtraction of the \ncar total tank-to-wheel energy consumption from the total road energy consumption. This step \nallowed the creation of several energy quantities that were distributed into the remaining sub-\n\nmodes of bus, moto, van and freight segment. Hence, the Tremove model was used to separate \nthose quantities through the usage of relative weights (%).  \n\nThis methodology was viewed as enough representative with the objective of constructing a \npotential picture for those remaining sub- modes of transport.  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nResults and discussions \n\n \n\n180 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n2.3.Bus \n\n \nOn the bus sector it was considered the same energy efficiency per pkm for the diesel and \n\nnatural gas bus (0,81MJ/pkm) as a result of equally dividing the previously calculated energy \nfor bus. This method allowed the establishment of mathematic relations between the energy \nquantities with the passenger mobility demand. This was viewed as a valid methodology to \n\ntest the well-to-wheel impacts on future scenarios.  \nOnce the average tank-to-wheel energy per pkm as well as the occupancy rate was in line with \n\nother studies, was strange how the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per km resulted in a higher \nvalue. The value of 16,4MJ/km seemed to be the upper value of the range of values found \nfrom other studies. \n\nImagining that the bus would have a tank-to-wheel energy efficiency of about 13MJ/km (-\n20%), it would increase the remaining rest-road-diesel energy quantity in about 7%. From this \n\nview point, this assumption is not viewed as having an important contr ibution for the \nremaining tank-to-wheel diesel, and would not influence the developed scenarios.  \n \n\n \n2.4.Van \n\n \nIt was calculated an average tank-to-wheel energy efficiency of about 4,9MJ/km for both \ndiesel and gasoline vans, resulting from the assumption of ha ving equal energy efficiencies.  \n\nFrom the technical view point that is an invalid assumption.  \nRemembering the JEC tank-to-wheel energy efficiency variations to gasoline, a diesel engine \n\nis about 15% more efficient than the gasoline one. That would reduce the total diesel for van \nin about 15%, with the respective increase on the available diesel for the rest-road-diesel in \nabout 3%. As similarly to the bus case, a 3% increase would not bring additional influences \n\nfor the developed future scenarios.  \n \n\nThe same happens for gasoline. Considering the extreme case of having a 15% higher value \ncompared to 4,9MJ/km, it would result in the 15% increase on the gasoline consumption from \nvan, and the respective reduction in about 12% on the total gasoline available for rest-road-\n\ngasoline. Once the remaining gasoline goes only for the moto segment, it would correspond to \na reduction of about 12% in the available energy for moto.  \n\n \n \n\n2.5.Motorcycle \n\n \nContinuing the previous calculation, the 12% reduction of the tank-to-wheel gasoline for moto \n\nwould reduce the tank-to-wheel energy efficiency per km from 0,92MJ/km to 0,81MJ/km.  \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nResults and discussions \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  181 \n\n \n\n3. Biofuels well-to-tank \n\n \nOnce of the delicate points behind the model development might be the characterization of the \n\nwell-to-tank biofuel contribution both at the energy and CO2 level.  \n \nThe used methodology was designed in such a way that allows the calculation of extreme \n\nscenarios, such as the 100% or 0% biofuel blend. Once the calculation takes into account the \nenergy blend of the biofuels in the blended mixture, the well-to-tank will vary in the same \n\nproportion. That will always provide the results and not an error value (e.g. dividing by zero).  \n \nHere, the big impact is the consideration of both the crop and the pathway.  \n\n  \nAs described by the \u201cJEC Well-to-Wheels\u201d study, if it is being considered an ethanol coming \n\nfrom Wheat produced in a CHP plant using wood as fuel, it corresponds to a 194% ratio of the \nwell-to-tank energy respecting to the tank-to-wheel. As opposition, if considering bioethanol \nproduced from Wheat in a CHP using natural gas as fuel, the ratio would reduce to  about \n\n105%. The same happens for biodiesel.  \n \n\nFor the CO2 case, it was decided to use the default values published by the renewable energy \ndirective for the most popular (assumed) biofuel pathways and crops.  \nIt was taken for example the ethanol coming from sugar cane from Brazil as well as the \n\nbiodiesel from rapeseed, with the respective factors of 24 and 52gCO2/MJ. Similarly to the \nenergy case, the big impact is the consideration of the crop and the pathway.  \n\nFor example, considering ethanol from wheat produced in a CHP plant using lignite as fuel, \nthe factor would increase facto r from 24 to 70gCO2/MJ (+191%).  \nThe same happens for the biodiesel case. If instead of conventional rapeseed  would be \n\nconsidered the biodiesel produced from palm oil, it would increase the CO2 factor from 52 to \n68gCO2/MJ (+31%). \n\n \nThe origin of the crop as well its production process and used fuel, largely influences the well-\nto-tank energy and CO2 and by consequence the well-to-wheel. The consideration of average \n\nvalues for all situations provides also average energy and CO2 potential variations.  \nIt is possible to test these independent variations  with the developed model however they were \n\nnot analyzed on this dissertation. \n \n \n\n4. Results \n \n\nThe following chart resumes, in a simple way, the well- to-wheel energy distribution for the \nroad transport sector between all analyzed transport sub-modes, both for passenger mobility \nand freight transport purposes.

Biofuels \n \nMethodology \n\n \nSeparating the rail+road energy data coming from each NREAP, with the road split into all \nenergy carriers, were the major steps in this calculation.  \n\n \nCalculating the rail total energy was viewed as correct exercise once it was used the renewable \n\nelectricity absolute quantity and share published on the NREAP, as well as the electricity \nshare in the rail sector provided by the Ex-Tremis model. \n \n\nThe separation of the road energy into its major details such as gasoline, diesel and biofuels \ncan be viewed as not exact. In fact, it is not exact once it was not considered on this \n\ndissertation the contribution of LPG and CNG. However, for e valuating the potential biofuel \nblends, the calculation of the LPG and CNG would not bring additional contributions.  \nEvaluating the importance of gasoline and diesel in road was the used methodology to project \n\nfuture gasoline and diesel consumptions for each member state.  \n \n\n \nResults \n\n \n\nOnce the European Union did not require to the Member States to follow any specific \nroadmap for transport, the calculations showed the independent approach from all member \n\nstates to the biofuel question. It resulted in about 27 different biofuel blends at European level, \none by country. \n \n\nIt was also interesting to conclude that the countries where the biofuel blends were low were \ngenerally countries where the relevance of electric vehicles was higher. It means that those \n\ncountries decided their strategy to meet the target for renewable energy for transport in electric \nvehicles, instead of biofuels.  \nIn this case, there was a direct relationship between the countries with higher renewable \n\nelectricity shares with the countries with low biofuel blend. For example Austria, Denmark, \nItaly, Latvia and Portugal, announced renewable electricity shares of 71%, 52%, 30%, 60% \n\nand 55% respectively, and a biofuel blend of E7-B7, E8-B7, E9-B9, E6-B4 and E3-B12, lower \nwhen compared to the EU avera ge blend of E11-B12. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and discussions \n\n \n\n186 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n6.2.1. Electric vehicles \n \nCalculating a potential number of electric vehicles in road by 2020 relied on the methodology \n\nof finding the total expected electricity to be consumed by 2020, and the expected annual \nelectricity consumed by one electric vehicle.  \nThe calculation of the total electricity was viewed as a correct exercise once it consider the \n\nrenewable electricity published by the NREAP, as well as its announced renewable electricity \nshare by 2020.  \n\nThe expected annual electricity consumption by an electric vehicle came from an internal \nvalue and was considered as a potential reliable value for purposes of this dissertation. \n \n\nA potential European market size of about 20million EVs corresponding to about 9,5% of the \nautomotive fleet seems to be a very high value when comparing to what is currently being \n\nannounced by most of the Member States, about 2-3% by 2020 [54] [55]. \nLooking at the member state level, countries such as Austria and Ireland expect about 1million \nof electric vehicles which correspond to about 20% and 40% of its automotive fleet, \n\nrespectively. That seems also impossible in the current context.  \n \n\nAdditionally, countries such as Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, The Netherlands, Slovakia \nand Spain expects to have about 10-15% of its automotive fleet in electric vehicles. This is \nalso higher when compared to the European average.  \n\nIn absolute terms, the major contributors for the EU figure are the countries of Belgium (2M), \nFrance (4M), Germany (2M), Italy (4M), Spain (3M) and the United K ingdom (1M).  \n\n \nMotivated by the electricity mix,  national economy, or Government incentives,  countries for \nexample such as Austria, France, Italy, Latvia, Portugal, Spain expects a large contribution of \n\nelectric vehicles.  \nMaking the comparison between the electricity mix on these countries, there is a large \n\ntendency of the countries where hydro power is important to adopt the incentives for electric \nvehicles. More recently, new technologies such as wind power are motivating countries such \nas Denmark and Germany on the areas of electric vehicles and renewable electricity. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and discussions \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  187 \n\n \n\n6.3. Final scenarios \n \nResulting from the likely technology situation that might be in place by 2020, a potential 10% \n\nenergy reduction compared to the reference case of 2007 is likely to happen.  \n \n\n \nFigure 131 \u2013 [Res ults] Final e nergy scenario.  \n\n \n \n\nOn the CO2 case, a potential 16% tank-to-wheel CO2 reduction is likely to be reachable, \nfollowed by the 12% in the well-to-wheel. \n \n\n \nFigure 132 \u2013 [Results] Final CO2 scenari o \n\n \n \n\n\n\nResults and discussions \n\n \n\n188 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nFrom all the developed scenarios, those which present the largest potential to reduce energy \n\nconsumption and CO2 emissions are the full modal-shift into collective modes, the energy \nefficiency improvements and the uptake of electric vehicles.  \n \n\n \n\nFull modal-shift \n\nThis was a theoretical exercise to test an unlikely situation: if happens a full modal-shift from \npassenger car into collective transport modes. Door-to-door service as well as comfort and \nprivacy will keep key factors in retain this shift. Also, might be that in an extreme scenario of \n\nincreasing the oil price into historic levels, the use of public transport will be chosen in \ndepreciation of the usage of the private vehicle as concluded by the White Paper. \n \n\n \n\nHigh-speed rail infrastructure \n\nThe lower energy and CO2 well-to-wheel efficiency per pkm of the high-speed segment \ncompared to the aviation and private cars, offers the potential to largely reduce the energy \n\nconsumption and CO2 emissions from longer journeys. However, the low deployment state of \nthe high-speed infrastructure results in a low capacity to absorb passengers from aviation and \npassenger car. Therefore, in the short term the high-speed segment does not provide important \n\nenergy and CO2 reductions, but offers an interesting potential for the long term.  \n \n\n \n\nElectric vehicles \n\nThe full uptake of electric vehicles that allows the replacement of all urban distances currently \n\nperformed by IC E cars represents the best measure to reduce the overall well-to-wheel CO2 \nemissions and energy consumption. However, from the analysis of the announced policies on \nthe NREAPs for the major countries, it does not seem that the member states will favour the \n\npurchase of such quantity of electric vehicles. Both due the economic crisis as well as due the \nlow charging infrastructure development, it does not seem that the expansion of the electric \n\nvehicle segment will have a full shift. \nAlso resulting from the NREAPs, a 9,5% uptake of electric vehicles appears as the reality \ncalculation case. The announced measures by each member state to the purchase of electric \n\nvehicles as well as low emission vehicles favour the smooth uptake of electric vehicles. Also, \nsome Member States such as the Netherlands support also the construction of charging \n\nstations. \n \n\n \n\nEnergy efficiency improvements \n\nOne of the measures that allow for a large reduction in energy consumption and CO2 \nemissions is the improvements on energy efficiency. This appears as one the most probable \n\nmeasure for the decade to come as it would not drastically change the social-transport habits \n(as the full modal-shift case) and also no need to have a special charging infrastructure (as the \n\ncase of electric vehicles).  \nFrom the NREAP?s measures, the purchase of energy-efficiency vehicles is also motivated \nand is under the \u201elow-emissions? strategies of most of the countries.  \n\n\n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  189 \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 7 \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n190 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nConclusions \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  191 \n\n \n\n7. Conclusions \n \nThe need for decision makers to project future energy scenarios for the transport sector \n\nrequired the development of an interactive prediction tool allowing the manipulation of all \nparameters that are associated to the transport energy and environmental performance. Hence, \nit is highly recommended that the development of a reference case relies on data representative \n\nof the actual situation such as the one coming from the Eurostat. The need to characterize the \nexpected 2020 transport energy situation with reliable and trustable data, lead to the analysis \n\nof external data sources such as the \u201cJEC Biofuel Programme\u201d together with each 27 Member \nState National Renewable Energy Actio n Plans. \n \n\nThe methodology for the development of the 2007 reference case was designed in such a way \nto fit with the total quantities published by the Eurostat. This was the major condition behind \n\nall the methodology and calculations for each transport sub- mode. Summing up all the  \ncalculated tank-to-wheel energy, CO2 and passenger mobility quantities on this dissertation \nresulted in the published quantities by the Eurostat.  \n\n \n \n\nApplication of percentage energy weights \n\nThe concept of using percentage weights o f energy quantities respecting to a total energy was \nthe methodology used to transfer information present in both the Ex-Tremis and Tremove \n\nmodels, into the European reality. With this methodology it was possible to respect the energy \ndistribution profile and apply it to any energy absolute quantity.  \n\nIn the absence of any additional specific type of information, data source or detailed model, it \nwas decided to use this methodology for the characterization of different tank-to-wheel energy \nconsumptions for some transport sub- modes. It was decided to consider as more important the \n\nprofile information coming from the relevant European models such as Ex-Tremis and \nTremove and to export and apply that profile to the Eurostat reality.  \n\n \n \nWell-to-wheel scope differences \n\nOne of the points of this dissertation that might be critical is the difference between the fossil \nliquid fuels and the electricity well-to-wheel scope. \n\n \nThe JEC well-to-wheel scope accounts for the steps of extraction, transport into the refinery, \nrefining and transport till the final consumption point, while the electricity adopted scope \n\naccounts for the primary energy needed to produce the electricity, and the transmission losses \nat the electricity grid to deliver the electricity at each final point (electric train or electric \n\nvehicle). \nIn other hand, the electricity well-to-wheel adopted scope accounts for the primary energy \nneeded at the power plant, and misses the energy needed for extraction, for transport into the \n\npower plant as well is eventual process or refinery.  \n \n\n \n\n\n\nConclusions \n\n \n\n192 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \n\nWell-to-wheel methodology differences \n\nThe application of energy and CO2 ratios coming from the \u201cJEC Well- to-wheels\u201d was viewed \n\na correct method to calculate the potential well-to-tank energy consumption and CO2 \nemissions from the usage of fossil and liquid fuels. It was considered that there are no large \nvariations according to the intensity of the tank-to-wheel energy or CO2 per km that might \n\nlargely influence this value.  \n \n\nOn the electricity methodology, it was applied the average efficiency of European power \nplants, as well as the efficiency related to the transmission and distribution losses. In this case, \nit is viewed as respected the adopted scope.  \n\n \n \n\nThe JEC Biofuel Programme \n\nThe \u201cJEC Biofuel Programme\u201d was the basic energy data source for having the total tank-to-\nwheel energy and CO2 quantities. In the absence of any better representative and trustable \n\ndata, the JEC appears as the most complete and actual European road energy data.  \nAfter the input of the passenger car details coming from the study, building the car sector as \n\nwell as the remaining sub-modes became a relative easy task to perform.  \n \n \n\nThe need to resort to external data sources \n\nHaving representative average European data was the most difficult task to solve. The lack of \n\ndata in what regards for the characterization of the average European transport situation seems \nboth to be protected for confidentially matters or by non-statistics collection of data.  \nHaving for example the average number of passengers per vehicle, or its average energy \n\nefficiency, or its characterization by energy type, were some of most relevant difficulties of \nthis dissertation. \n\nThe absence of data lead to the search of studies dedicated for each topic allowing the \nassumption of variables with posterior calibration.  \n \n\n \nKey achieved figures \n\nThis dissertation allowed concluding that the transport sector consumed about 18.095PJ of \nenergy and emitted about 1.288Mt of CO2, in a well-to-wheel basis.  \nRoad transport sector was the most important mode, respo nsible for 84% of the total energy \n\nconsumption and 85% of the total CO2 emissions. Here, passenger cars were the most \nimportant transport sub-mode, representing about 47% of the total energy consumption and \n\n48% of the total CO2 emissions.  \n \nThe air transport sector was the second most important energy consumer and CO2 emitter, \n\naccounting to about 9% and 10% respectively, followed by the rail transport sector which \naccounted to about 5% of the well- to-wheel energy consumption and 3% on the well- to-wheel \n\nCO2 emissions. The remaining 2% were allocated to the sea sector.  \n \n\n\n\nConclusions \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  193 \n\n \n\nWithin the rail transport sector, the normal-speed segment is the most important player both at \n\nthe energy consumer and passenger mobility transporter. It accounted for 79% of the rail?s \nwell-to-wheel energy consumption, and 82% of the rail?s well- to-wheel CO2 emissions.  \n\n \nThis dissertation also concluded that the passenger transport segment was responsible for \nabout 70% of the total transport?s well-to-wheel energy consumption, with the respective 69% \n\non total CO2 emissions, being the remaining 30% energy for freight transport purposes.  \nUnder the passenger mobility segment, this dissertation concluded that urban areas are \n\nresponsible for about 52% of the total well-to-wheel energy consumption, be ing the remaining \n12% consumed in rural areas and 35% on long passenger services. Once more, passenger cars \nare the most representative mode in both urban and rural areas, being the second player on \n\nlong distance passenger mobility, after aviation (13%). \n \n\nFrom the analysis of the 27 National Renewable Energy Action Plans, it was possible to \nestablish a better characterization of the future?s energy and transport situation by 2020.  \nIt resulted that by 2020, the electricity will come as 36% from renewable ene rgy sources, \n\npresenting a strong expansion of the wind sector. \nOn the transport sector, the biofuel calculations for all EU resulted in a bioethanol blend of \n\n11% in volume and a 12% volume biodiesel blend. The electricity consumed in road \nannounced by all Member States, allowed to a calculation of a potential market size for \nelectric vehicles, which was calculated as 9,5% of the automotive fleet in 2007.  \n\n \nConsidering the expected passenger mobility demand by 2020, the expected energy efficiency \n\nimprovements for the aviation, bus, passenger car and passenger van segments, the calculated \nNREAPs biofuel blends and electric vehicles by 2020, and finally the expected high-speed \nlines by 2020, it was possible to conclude that a 10% tank-to-wheel energy reduction is \n\npotentially achievable compared to 2007, together with a 2% well-to-wheel energy reduction. \nOn the CO2 emissions case, a reduction of 16% and 12% tank-to-wheel and well- to-wheel \n\nrespectively, is potentially achievable.  \n \n  \n\nThe importance of the results \nThe development of a detailed and comprehensive transport model allowed the well- to-wheel \n\ncharacterization of all of its main sub- modes, evaluating all the energy and CO2 contributions.  \nAnalysing each member state National Renewable Energy Action Plan from a car OEM \nperspective allowed the characterization of the potential biofuel and electric vehicle situation \n\nby 2020, identifying critical or opportunity markets that might affect future business.  \nThe projection of future scenarios based on the developed reference case through the input of \n\nthe relevant sources of data constituted in a key tool for Toyota Motor Europe future business \ndecisions. \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n194 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  195 \n\n \n\n \n\nSUGGESTIONS FOR \n\nFUTURE WORK \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n196 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nSuggestions for future work \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  197 \n\n \n\n8. Suggestions for future work \n \nFrom a theoretical view point, each parameter calculated on this dissertation would provide a \n\npotential and individual research work. Finding the average situation for each sub - mode of \ntransport, as well as its variation by energy type requires the deep analysis of the European \nsituation. \n\n \nThe developed transport model can be further updated if the external input data or newer and \n\nmore representative information comes up. The following organigram attempts to reproduce \nthis idea. \n \n\n \nFigure 133 \u2013 [Conclusions] Potential data updates. \n\n \n \n\nThis scheme suggests the different approaches that is possible to think about in order to update \nthe transport model.  \n\n \n \nPreliminary study: metro and high-speed \n\n \n\nIn order to study the total tank-to-wheel energy consumption differences between the metro \n\nand the high-speed segments, it could be interesting to develop a study that collects the \n\nTransport model\n\nEuropean occupancy \nrate data\n\nEuropean \npassenger \n\nmobility by \nenergy type\n\nWell-to-tank energy \nand CO2 efficiency\n\nEuropean \nenergy \n\nefficiency by \ntransport \nsub-mode\n\n\n\nSuggestions for future work \n\n198 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nnumber of services of each mode, then project likely energy consumption from those services, \n\nallowing the comparison of the gross energy impact.  \nAs a gross message, it could be interesting to see how many services and annual km are \n\ncurrently being performed both by the metro and high- speed. \n \n \n\nPreliminary study: occupancy rate \n\n \n\nIt could be potentially interesting realize a research on the average occup ancy rate for all the \nmetro and normal-speed services in the EU. For example, collecting information relative to all \ncountries and build a EU picture.  \n\n \n \n\nPreliminary study: bus energy efficiency \n\n \nIt could be interesting to collect all the information related to bus services in the EU and \n\ncharacterize its average energy efficiency, and compare with the one of this dissertation to see \nif there are large discrepancies or not.  \n\n \n \nPreliminary study: peak and non-peak hours \n\n \nGiven the differences on energy consumpt ion profiles and on patterns on passenger mobility \n\ndemand, the link between an energy transport model and the peak and non-peak hours study \ndemand could be very interesting to perform. With this study, it could be potentially possible \nto study the best energy-on-time for the passenger mobility-on-time demand. Imagining in a \n\nhypothetical scenario, for any decision of passenger mobility demand, it could be selected \nwhich should be the energy to be used in that moment (or for that travel) to minimize impacts.  \n\n \n \nPreliminary study: well-to-tank \n\n \nAs an external and totally independent exercise, it could be interesting to analyze the total \n\nelectricity produced at the EU and to separate all of its destinations. For example, some of \nthem go to household, other to ind ustry and other for transport (rail), in a smaller amount. That \ntype of analysis would provide another type of value that would be compared to the one of this \n\ndissertation.  \n \n\nAlso, on the \u201cenergy refineries\u201d category of the Eurostat, it could be realized t he same \nexercise. Divide the released CO2 emissions into its details such as fuel for electricity \nproduction, fuel for household and fuel for transport. It is a hard but potentially interesting \n\nexercise, not only for purposes of this dissertation, but since other perspectives.  \n\n\n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  199 \n\n \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n200 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nReferences \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  201 \n\n \n\n9.

The National Renewable Energy Action Plans \n \n\nArticle 4 of the renewable energy directive 2009/28/EC required member states to submit \n\nnational renewable energy action plans by 30 J une 2010. These plans, to be prepared in \naccordance with the template published by the Commission, provide details roadmaps of how \neach Member State expects to reach their binding 2020 objectives for the share of renewable \n\nenergy in their final energy cons umption. \nMember States must set out the sectoral renewable energy targets, the expected technology \n\nmix to have in place, trajectory and measures that they will undertake to drive their national \nenergy markets into the deployment of renewable energy. The NR EAPs provide an overview \nof the three main energy sectors: heating and cooling, electricity and transport, in the uptake of \n\nrenewable energy sources in the final energy consumption.  \n \n\nFor purposes of this dissertation, the electricity and the transport sector were considered as the \nmost important ones. According to the template, Table 1 of each NREAP should describe the \nfinal energy consumption quantities of the three sectors, Table 10 should report the expected \n\nrenewable energy consumption, and, on the transport sector, Table 12 should provide \ninformation on the expected renewable energy consumption by energy type.  \n\n \n \n\nFinal energy consumption \n \nGathering all the information from the 27 Member States, it is expected that by 2020 the EU \n\nwill have a final energy consumption of about 1.117Mtoe, essentially driven by the energy \nconsumption on heating and cooling, which represents about 46% of EU?s final energy \nconsumption. The electricity and the transport sector are expected to represent about 26% and \n\n28%. \n \n\n \nFigure 154 \u2013 [NREAP] EU\u2019s final e nergy c onsumption.  \n\n \n\n\n\nAnnexes \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  217 \n\n \n\n \n\nIt is expected that by 2020, the European Union will present the same level of final energy \nconsumption as in 2005 (when Bulgaria and Romania were not members) with a marginal \n\nincrease of 0,3%. Within the three sectors, the heating and cooling is expected to decrease \nabout 5% while the electricity and the transport sector are expected to present an increase of \nabout 8% and 4% respectively.  \n\n \nThe deployment of the renewable energy sector within the final energy consumption is on \n\ntrack to reach the 20% of renewables by 2020. From the collection of the data from all \nMember S tates, the EU is expected to reach a level of 22% of renewable energies in its final \nenergy consumption by 2020, presenting an expected renewable energy consumption of about \n\n247Mtoe. The heating and cooling and the electricity sector are the largest contributors for this \nincrease, about 86%, while the transport sector contributes with a lower amount of renewable \n\nenergy, 14%. \n \n \n\n \nFigure 155 \u2013 [NREAP] EU\u2019s rene wable energ y share by sector.  \n\n \n\n \nOn a sectoral basis, it is expected that by 2020 the electricity will come as 36% from \nrenewable energy sources, followed by the heating and cooling sector wit h about 21% and the \n\ntransport sector with about 11% (under the RED methodology). Here, the transport sector is on \ntrack to meet its 10% renewable energy objective underlined on the European C limate C hange \n\nPackage. \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nAnnexes \n\n218 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nRenewable energy \n \n\n1.

Transport \n \nUnder the European C limate C hange Package each Member State should achieve a mandatory \n\nobjective of 10% renewable energy in the transport sector. According to the methodology \ndescribed on the renewable energy directive (2009/28/EC), the 10% is calculated with all \nrenewable energies used in the transport sector, divided by all petrol, diesel and electricity \n\nused in road and rail (including biofuels). CNG, LPG are excluded from the denominator, but \nbiogas is included in the numerator (considered as biofuel).  \n\n \nThe renewable energy directive required the adoption of a methodology to calculate the \nenergy share of renewable energies in transport. It says that biofuels in accordance with the \n\nArticle 21(2) (made from industrial or municipal wastes) will count twice towards the \nobjective while renewable electricity used in road transport will count 2.5 times.  \n\n \nOn the NREAPs, each Member State published the roadmap that they want to put in place in \ntheir national territory to reach their objectives. Each Member State filled up the table 1 with \n\nRoad+Rail transport energy consumption, and an additional row if aviation exceeds 6.18% of \nthe final energy consumption; Table 12 should mention the bioethanol, biodiesel, renewable \n\nhydrogen, renewable electricity in road and non-road, and also others (such as biogas and \nvegetable oils) energy expected consumption.  \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 164 \u2013 [NREAP] EU\u2019s r ail+road energy consumpti on.  \n\n \n \n\nIt is expected that by 2020 the Road and Rail transport energy will present an increase of 5% \nabove 2005 levels, where renewable energy is already included, reaching a level of about \n\n312Mtoe by 2020. This value includes all forms of energy consumed in rail and road transport, \nsuch as electricity and diesel used in rail, gasoline, diesel and biofuels used on road transport.  \n\n\n\nAnnexes \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  225 \n\n \n\nRenewable energy for transport \n \nAs a conglomeration of all results and without taking into account the renewable energy \n\nfactors described by the renewable energy directive (RED) methodology, biodiesel is expected \nto be the largest renewable energy consumed in transport, accounting about 66% of all \nrenewable energies, fo llowed by bioethanol which is expected to represent about 22%. \n\nRenewable electricity in transport is expected to have a smaller contribution, about 9%, while \n\u201eOthers? is expected to be marginal 2%.  \n\n \n  \n\n \nFigure 165 \u2013 [NREAP] EU\u2019s rene wable energ y consumpti on in tr ans port.  \n\n \n\n \nIn 2005 the consumption of renewable energies in transport almost entirely relied on the \n\nrenewable electricity consumed in the rail sector, with also a considerable amount of biodiesel \non road sector. In 2005, the renewable energies in road+rail reached the level of about 4Mtoe, \nwhere about 2Mtoe were in forms of biodiesel.  \n\n \nBy 2020, the agglomerated data provided by the NREAPs predict a large expansion on the \n\nusage of renewable energies in transport, when compared to 2005 levels (+685%). Renewable \nenergies in forms of bioethanol and biodiesel are expected to be the most used sources.  \nBioethanol is expected to suffer the largest growth, about 1.300% but only representing about \n\n22% of all renewable energies in transport, while biodiesel is expected to be the largest \ncontributor for the renewable energies transport sector representing about 66%. The \ndeployment of renewable electricity in the road sector is expected to start from a negligent \n\nlevel on 2005 (~1ktoe), to about 667ktoe. \n \n\n\n\nAnnexes \n\n226 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nThe share of renewable energies in transport will be of about 11,4% calculated in accordance \n\nto the renewable energy directive methodology.

The following chart provides the year-by-year: \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure 166 \u2013 [NREAP] Evoluti on of RES -T share in Tr ans port.  \n\n \n \nBioethanol and biodiesel are expected to be crucial in helping the EU to meet its 10% \n\nrenewable energy objective, representing a global energy share of 2,4 and 7,4%, respectiv ely. \nBiofuels under the article21 of the renewable energy directive are expected to contribute with \n\n1,6% to the total transport energy demand while renewable electricity on road is expected to \ncontribute with about 0,5%.  \nIt is also possible to see that for the period between 2014 and 2020, the annual growth rate \n\nstarts to quickly increase.  \n  \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nAnnexes \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  227 \n\n \n\nCountry overview \n \nAs detailed described on the Table 67 of Annexes, almost all of the member states expect to \n\nreach the transport objective of having at least 10% of renewable energies in transport. \nBulgaria, C yprus and Estonia clearly mentioned their non-expectation of meeting the 10% \nobjective. Countries such as Finland, Germany, Spain and Sweden expect to exceed the 10% \n\nobjective, with high focus of Finland which expects an objective of 20% of renewable in \ntransport. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 167 \u2013 [NREAP] Re ne wable transport objecti ves by me mber state.  \n\n \n\n \nThe European Commission did not put in place any individual roadmap to advise each \n\nMember State on how to address their national 10% renewable energy transport objective, \ngiving freedom to each Member State to decide the renewable energy mix that they want to \nput in place in their national markets.  \n\nOnce it was collected all member states individual data, it was possible to characterize the \nindividual transport mix. The following chart provides the obtained results:  \n\n  \n\n \nFigure 168 \u2013 [NREAP] Transport rene wable e nergy mi x by c ountr y.  \n\n \n\n\n\nAnnexes \n\n228 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nGenerally, most of the member states do expect a large penetration of biodiesel in their \n\ntransport markets, both in forms of first or second generation biodiesel. In opposition, \ncountries such as Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Malta, Sweden and the United K ingdom expect \n\nalso a large introduction of bioethanol, in both forms.  \nFocus for example for Austria and Sweden as they expect to rely significantly on renewable \nelectricity to reach its national objective, both in road and non-road transport.  \n\n \nNote: This exercise was realized in accordance to the methodology described on the \n\nrenewable energy directive however, some of the calculated energy objectives (%) do not \nmatch with the published objectives on each national action plan. Some incoherencies on the \ncalculations were found when compared to the published national reports but, for purposes of \n\nthis dissertation, those differences are not explained neither analyzed.  \n \n\nAs an example, Malta provided an energy consumption of renewable electricity on non-road \ntransport which is about 30% of the total transport consumption, largely influencing the final \ntransport renewable energy objective. The previous figure is therefore not the correct one for \n\nthose countries. Also, Romania did not provide any details on renewable energy consumption \nin transport once Table 12 of the report was empty.  \n\n \nIn order to provide an example vision of the different approaches from each member state to \nthe transport renewable energy question, five countries were selected as representative of five \n\ndifferent approaches: \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 169 \u2013 [NREAP] Different rene wable  energy appr oac hes for trans por t.  \n\n \n \n\nHere are presented five countries where the renewable energy approach for transport was \ndifferent. On the Austrian side, it is expected that about 39% of the renewable energy \n\n\n\nAnnexes \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  229 \n\n \n\nconsumption in transport will come from renewable electricity, in a distribution of 18% for \n\nroad and 21% for non-road transport. For example for bioethanol, Greece is the country which \nlargely rely on bioethanol, about 65% of its re newable energy for transport, while Denmark \n\ncan be example on the usage of second generation bioethanol, which represents about 33% of \nits renewable energy for transport. On the biodiesel side, Germany can be example of a large \nusage and importance of biod iesel, about 70% of its renewable energies for transport. O n the \n\nothers case, Sweden is the country where it has a larger importance, about 19%, driven by an \nincrease on the biogas segment.  \n\n \n \n\nPotential biofuel blends \n \nOne of the objectives of this dissertation and in particular of this chapter is to identify potential \n\nbiofuels blends that might come in the future years at the EU community and member state \nlevel. For purposes of this dissertation, the biofuel volume blending was calculated according \nto the following equation: \n\n \n \n\nbiofuelfossilfuel\n\nbiofuel\n\nVolumeVolume\n\nVolume\n Eq. 140 \n\n \n \nThe equation allows calculating the percentage in volume of a biofuel in a blend with the \n\ncorrespondent fossil fuel.  \n \n\nThe need to find the values for the volume of gasoline and diesel expected by each member \nstate, lead to the construction of a past history on gasoline and diesel consumption for each \nmember state and project a likely future gasoline and diesel consumptions for 2020 based on \n\nthe data provided by each N REAPs.  \n \n\nAs described before, each NREAP provides energy data quantities for the agglomerate energy \ncategory of Rail+Road transport. Here, in order to find the details of Road transport, the \nenergy data of Rail+Road data need to be first separated in Rail and Road, then using the \n\n\u201cRoad\u201d separated into the gasoline, diesel and biofuels: \n \n\n1.

With the share of electricity in the rail sector for each member state, it \nwas possible to calculate a potential total rail energy consumption.  \n\n \n \n\nktoenconsumptioenergyrailTotal ...\n%railin y electricit of share\n\nktoerailfor y Electricit\n Eq. 142 \n\n \n\n \nAfter calculating the total rail energy consumption, it was used the Rail+Road energy coming \n\nfrom each 27 member state N REAP, and calculate a dedicated value for Road energy \nconsumption for each member state.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAnnexes \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  231 \n\n \n\nnconsumptioenergyRoadktoenconsumptioenergyrailTotalRoadRail\nNREAP\n\n..)(...  Eq. 143 \n\n \n\n \nHaving the total road energy consumption, it wa s required to split into its most used fossil \n\nenergy carriers (gasoline, diesel, LPG, CNG and biofuels).  \nIn order to have a representative value for the fossil road energy, it was first subtracted the \ncontribution of the biofuels for the road energy consumption: \n\n \n \n\nenergyroadfossilbiofuelsnconsumptioenergyRoad ....  Eq. 144 \n\n \n \nWith this equation, it was calculated the value for fossil road energy that is undertaken in each \n\n27 Member States. \nHaving this value, it was necessary to separate the fossil road energy into gasoline, diesel, \n\nLPG and CNG. Here, it should be mentioned that it was not made any differentiation between \nLPG and CNG both due its lower relevance to the total road energy and considering that will \nnot bring additional information on calculating potential biofuels blends.  \n\n \nFrom the consultation of the Eurostat, it was possible to build a past history on gasoline and \n\ndiesel energy consumption, allowing the creation of a share of gasoline and diesel in road.  \nHere is the example for Austria: \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 171 \u2013 [NREAP] Austrian e xample for g asoline and diesel history [11]. \n\n \n \nFrom the example, it is possible to visualize the evolution for the considered past period 2005-\n\n2008 for both gasoline and diesel consumption.  \nWith these values, it was possible to calculate a past tendency on the share of both gasoline \n\nand diesel in road. Here is the Austrian example: \n \n \n\n\n\nAnnexes \n\n232 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 172 \u2013 [NREAP] Austrian e xample for g asoline and diesel road share.  \n\n \n \n\nBy watching past tendencies on those shares, it was considered that until 2020 no radical \nchanges on the gasoline and diesel shares were expected. Therefore, it was assumed a decrease \n\nof about 2% on the gasoline share from 2008 until 2020, with an increase on diesel 2%. As an \nexample, if on 2008 the gasoline share was of 35%, by 2020 it was assumed to be 33% and the \nsame logic to the diesel case. Here is the Austrian example: \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure 173 \u2013 [NREAP] Austrian future projections of gasoline and diesel road shares.  \n\n \n \nHaving defined future gasoline and diesel shares, it was decided to apply those shares to the \n\ncalculated fossil road energy.

Figure 176 and \nFigure 177 show the results for all Member States. \n \n\n \nBiofuel blend country results \n\n \nHaving both fossil and biofuels values, it was decided to convert them into volume. This \nexercise was realized through the usage of several conversion factors.  \n\nAfter realizing all the calculations, a fina l table with the calculated potential biofuels blends by \n2020 for each Member State was built.  \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nAnnexes \n\n234 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nTable 65 \u2013 [NREAP] P otential bi ofuel blends.  \n\nCountry Bioethanol Biodiesel \n\nAustria E7 B7 \n\nBelgium E10 B11 \nBulgaria E9 B12 \nCyprus E5 B8 \n\nCzech Republic E8 B13 \nDenmark E8 B7 \n\nEstonia E14 B11 \nFinland E11 B20 \nFrance E12 B10 \n\nGermany E7 B17 \nGreece E16 B10 \n\nHungary E22 B7 \nIreland E10 B11 \nItaly E9 B9 \n\nLatvia E6 B4 \nLithuania E12 B14 \n\nLuxembourg E5 B8 \nMalta E13 B8 \nNetherlands E11 B9 \n\nPoland E12 B15 \nPortugal E3 B12 \nRomania   \n\nSlovakia E13 B7 \nSlovenia E4 B15 \n\nSpain E10 B14 \nSweden E16 B7 \nUnited Kingdom E15 B12 \n\nTOTAL EU27 E11 B12 \n\n \n \n\nAs a conglomeration of all results, it was possible to see that all Member States had different \napproaches regarding biofuels blending. Countries such Austria and Latvia presents the lowest \n\nbiofuels blends, in opposition for example to Finland, Germany and Hungary which present \nhigher biofuels blends.  \nAs an average European calculation, it was calculated that by 2020 the average European \n\nUnion blending would be 11% for bioethanol and 12% for biodiesel. In that case, only Finland \nand the Netherlands would be close to the bioethanol blend, while Bulgaria, Portugal and the \n\nUnited K ingdom would be in line with the average biodiesel blend.  \n \nCountries such as France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United K ingdom are expected to \n\ndrive the Europe?s average, accounting for more than 60% of gasoline and 65% of diesel \n\n\n\nAnnexes \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  235 \n\n \n\nconsumption. On the biofuels side, also they are leading the market accounting for 60% of \n\nbioethanol and 69% of biodiesel expected consumption.  \n \n\nThese figures do not expect the introduction and deployment of protection grade fuels, neither \nthe introduction of mass fuels neither the usage of niche fue ls. These values would represent \nthe average fuel blend that might be in place by 2020, taking into account all current fleet and \n\nnot making any differentiation on compatibilities of engines, age of vehicles, etc.  \nThis is therefore the gross message coming from each member state NREAP.  \n\n \nThis was the result of a very simple calculation, and of course these figures rely on the \nassumptions behind all calculations, but even so the potential biofuels blending is there and \n\nthose values were considered as highly representative for purposes of this dissertation.  \n \n\n \n\nPotential market size for electric vehicles \n \n\nThe renewable electricity that is published on Table 12 of each NREAPs is an indication of \nboth the usage of electricity as transport?s energy carrier and the amplitude of the renewable \n\nelectricity share expected in that Member State. \n \nFor the calculation of the potential market size for electric vehicles, the total amount of \n\nelectricity that is expected to be consumed in road transport was calculated, and then divided it \nby a likely annual electricity consumption from one single electric vehicle. In this way, it is \n\npossible to calculate a potentia l number of electric vehicles that will consume the calculated \ntotal amount of electricity.

Calculation of the annual electricity consumption for an electric vehicle \n\n \nIt was assumed that an electric vehicle would consume about 0,15kWh/km and would have an \n\naverage annual mileage of 7.500km/year. That would result on an annual consumption of \n1.125kWh/year.vehicle. These general values came from internal analysis of Toyota?s energy \nresearch group.  \n\n \n \n\n3.

Focus on \ncountries such as France, Italy and Spain which expect a large number of electric vehicles in \ntheir markets. \n\nIt should be mentioned that the figures of renewable electricity for road transport provided by \nthe NREAPs might include all forms of electric road transport such as electric vehicles, \n\nelectric vans, electric buses, motorcycles, etc. However, for purposes of this dissertation and to \nhave a potential market size for electric vehicles, it was considered as most representative the \nconsumption from the electric vehicles segment and discard all the other consumptions from \n\nother electric-road transport modes. \n \n\n \n\nTransport policies \n \n\nChapter 4.5 of each N REAP provides information on measures and policies forecasted by each \nMember State in order to meet the published renewable energy objectives. As a result from the \n\ncollection of all the data, it was possible to conclude that all the measures could be divided in \nthree main groups: fuel tax incentives, new vehicle purchase incentives, energy/GHG quotas \nfor fuels. For example, it can be tax benefits for biofuels, price incentives for low-emissions \n\nvehicles purchase, quota for biofuels, greenhouse gas reduction, etc.  \n \n\nNot all the 27 Member States were analyzed because at that time the English translation was \nnot available. Therefore English translation was required for countries of special on this \ndissertation being only analyzed the countries of Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, \n\nGreece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United \nKingdom. \n\nRecently the European Commission published the English translation of t he NREAPs in its \nplatform however, due the recent time of its publication, the remaining countries were not \nanalyzed on this dissertation. As a note, it was concluded that the analyzed countries could be \n\nconsidered as valuable and representative informatio n for all European Union and might be \n\n\n\nAnnexes \n\n238 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nthat the analysis of the remaining countries would not bring additional information on the \n\nexpected measures.  \n \n\n \n\nCountry overview \n \n\nAustria [56] \n\n \n\nIn Austria, the \u201cNoVA programme\u201d is one payable tax which is due on initial registration of \nprivate motor vehicles. Its subject is being revised in order to promote the uptake of low \nemissions vehicles such as electric vehicles, hybrid, natural gas cars. Under this mechanism, a \n\nnew variant was created, the \u201cNoVA greening\u201d, which objective is to give a bonus purchase \nprice to low emission vehicles (<120gCO2/km), electric vehicles as well as E85 vehicles.  \n\nOther mechanism is the \u201cMotV programme\u201d. The MotV regulates the insurance tax for \nautomotive vehicles and is currently being revised to change from engine power to carbon \nemissions indexation. This means that low emission vehicles will receive an insurance bonus \n\non their annual taxes.  \nUnder a major Austrian mechanism, the \u201cK lima\u201d, there is the \u201cK lima aktiv mobil\u201d which \n\nobjective is to help the conversion of installed infrastructure or automotive fleets into more \nsustainable and low carbon ones. This range from the conversion of current engines into \nbiofuel capable (e.g. E85, biogas or vegetable oils), the promotion and marketing of \n\nsustainable transport modes in urban areas or, for example, the promotion and integration of \npublic transport systems with other modes such as bicycling, etc.  \n\nIn Austria, there is also the UFI, \u201cEnvironmental Assistance in Austria\u201d, which is another \nmechanism to promote the uptake of renewable and low carbon technologies. Under this \nmechanism, there is the support for the construction and modification of filling gas stations \n\ninto alternative fuels capable such as E85, b iogas or vegetable oils.  \nAccording to Austrian NREAP, it is expected that by 2013, bioethanol 10% (E10) will be \n\nintroduced on the market as well as biodiesel 10% (B10) by 2017, both depending on the \navailability of the European fuel standards.  \n \n\n \nDenmark [57] \n\n \nUnder the \u201cDenmark 2020\u201d strategy, focus to the tax exemption for electric vehicles which \nwas extended until 2015. Here, the Danish Government is on the way to prepare a research \n\nand demonstration program for electric vehicles and second generation biofuels ca lled \u201cthe \nCentre for Greener Transport\u201d, supervised by the Transport Ministry.  \n\nAfter 2017, it is expected that the taxation from car ownership will be indexed to car usage. \nThis is expected to make more attractive the energy efficiency vehicles.  \nUnder the \u201cEnergy Technology Programme\u201d, there was available about DKK200M for \n\nresearch and demonstration on second generation biofuels from 2007 to 2010. Recently, this \nprogramme was extended after 2010 and until 2013, with new projects such as electric \n\n\n\nAnnexes \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  239 \n\n \n\nvehicles being included on the programme. This new programme is called \u201cA green transport \n\npolicy\u201d. \n \n\n \nFinland [58] \n\n \n\nFinish national renewable energy action plan was very poor on transport policies and did not \ninclude the chapter 4.5. \n\n \n \nFrance [54] \n\n \n\nSince 2007 that France had in place scrap incentives for the renewal of older cars by more \n\nefficient ones. These scrap incentives were realized under the condition that a vehicle with \nmore than a certain age would be valued in \u20ac1.000 or \u20ac700 in case of exchanging for a new car. \nBy the end of 2011, this scrap incentive is due to exit. \n\nCurrently, and since 2009, bioethanol in a mixture of 10% (E10) is already available at the \npump stations. By 2017, it is expected that lingo-cellulosic biofuels will come into market, \n\ndespite their lower quantities. This means that still first generation biofuels are expected to \nremain the largest contributors on the period after 2017.  \nBy 2011, a new eco-tax is expected to be introduced to reduce transport?s carbon intensity. \n\nThis tax is due to promote the usage of non-road and non-aviation transport modes into rail \nones. This measure is linked with the new expected urban planning for French urban areas. It \n\nis expected to invest up to 2020 in the building of new rail lines as well as automatic drive \nmetros in the region of Ille-de-France, Paris. \nAs additional information, France expects to have in road by 2020 about 2M electric vehicles.  \n\n \n \n\nGermany [55] \n\n \nGermany has in place quotas for biofuel incorporation into fossil fuels from the year of 2007 \n\nup to 2020. Those quotas are calculated on an energy basis up to 2014 and between 2014 and \n2020 on greenhouse gas reduction. For example in 2010 is expected that bioethanol will be \n\nblended in 2,8% on energy content in gasoline and 4,4% biodiesel in diesel, while after 2014 \nthe quota moves from energy based to greenhouse gas reduction. As an example, by 2020 is \nexpected that the transport fuels used in transport should reduce the greenhouse gas emissions \n\nby 7% when compared to the fossil fuel.  \nIn relation to the biofuel taxes, since 2001 and up to 2015 Germany is giving tax benefits for \n\nthe usage of second generation biofuels, biogas and alternative fuels such as higher blends of \nethanol (E85).  \nSince August 2009 is in place the \u201cGerman Elektromobility Plan\u201d promoting the uptake of \n\nelectric vehicles. Under this plan, Germany expects to have about 1M electric vehicles on road \nby 2020. \n\n \n \n\n\n\nAnnexes \n\n240 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nGreece [59] \n\n \nSince 2009, the four Greek refineries are allowed to incorporate a maximum biodiesel volume \n\nblending of 7%, which standard was approved by the State C hemical Council (SCC).  \nUnder the strategies for promoting low emission vehicles, hybrid, electric and other types of \nlow-emission vehicles are exempted from the fuel consumption tax, the additional special tax, \n\nthe circulation tax and the registration tax. Also, there is in place a differentiation on the \nincentives according to the engine technology. For example, there is exclusion of hybrid cars \n\nfrom the traffic restrictio ns in the city of Athens.  \nAiming the definition and better understanding of future transport technologies, there is now \nin place a programme to define the technical specifications of energy efficient vehicles, clean \n\nvehicles, public procurement based on fuel economy labelling, trainings on eco-driving, etc. \n \n\n \nIreland [60] \n\n \n\nIreland did not provide much information on the transport measures up to 2020. In spite of the \nGovernment target of 10% electric vehicles by 2020, it started this year (2011) and is up 2012 \n\nan electric vehicle registration scheme to incentive the purchase of electric drive vehicles. This \nalso includes plug- in hybrid vehicles which also receive an additional exemption on the \nregistration tax. \n\n \n \n\nItaly [61] \n\n \nUnder a benefited contingent of \u20ac3,8M and \u20ac0,1M, the use of bioethanol can receive a special \n\nrate for the years of 2010 and 2011, however it is not mentioned which are the conditions for \nthose special rate.  \n\nThe usage of higher biodiesel b lends such as B25 is currently being revised and measures are \nbeing studied for usage only on captive fleets.  \nThe mechanism for the promotion of biomethane as transport energy motion is being extended \n\nfor further years, while its introduction on the natura l gas mix is currently being supported by \nthe Italian Government.  \n\n \n \nThe Netherlands [62] \n\n \nSimilarly to the Austrian, the Dutch Government started in 2008 a mechanism to support the \n\nconstruction of new alternative filling stations. The mechanism called \u201eTAB? provides \nincentives ranging according to the alternative fuel: for natural gas (\u20ac60.000 to \u20ac80.000), E85 \n(\u20ac20.000 to \u20ac28.000) or B30 (\u20ac13.000 to \u20ac19.000). Also the conversion of older filling \n\nstations into newer ones such as E85 or B30, receive incentives from \u20ac7.500 to \u20ac10.000.  \nRegarding alternative fuels, focus for the promotion of E85 as vehicle fuel, which is taxed on \n\nan energy content basis and it taxed in such way that its price is always lower when compared \nto conventional gasoline. \n\n\n\nAnnexes \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  241 \n\n \n\nSince 2009, the support scheme for electric mobility is not yet clear and defined. Recently, the \n\nMinistry of Transport and Waterways and Economic Affairs produced the \u201cPlan of Approach \nof Electric Driving\u201d. O ne of the main objectives of this program is to transform the \n\nNetherlands into the most international test area for electric driving between 2009 and 2011.  \n \n \n\nPoland [63] \n\n \n\nBetween the years of 2010 and 2011 it is expected the introduction of new measures and \nincentives for the promotion of biofuels. Most of the incentives will be related to fuel taxation \nin function of the level of blending.  \n\nThere is also the objective to introduce restricted areas for public transport which should run \non alternative fuels. The programme called \u201cMulti- Year Programme\u201d requires the replacement \n\nof conventional diesel engines by LPG, CNG, electric or hybrid. Under the same programme, \nGovernment entities, public bodies and local authorities should adapt and replace their fleets \nto the usage of alternative energies.  \n\nCurrently it is possible the usage of several dedicated blends such as E85, B20 or B100 but \nonly for captive fleets. It is objective to introduce in the future the blends of E10 and B10 and \n\nmake it accessible to the entire market.  \nBy 2020 it is objective to start a nd develop the production of second generation bioethanol and \nbiodiesel, and also the deployment of biohydrogen for the years between 2020 and 2025.  \n\n \n \n\nPortugal [64] \n\n \nThe Mobi.E is the programme that manages the electric mobility in Portugal. It aims to \n\ntransfer passengers into electricity for its energy carrier. By 2020, it is objective that about \n10% of road transport energy is electricity. Incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles are \n\nranging from \u20ac5.000 or \u20ac6.500 if with the scrap of old conventio nal cars (>8years).  \nBy 2011, it is objective to conduct and develop a pilot-project within 25 cities equipped in \ntotal with 1.300 slow charging and 50 fast charging points. The project aims to develop and \n\ncreate know-how on the management of electric vehic les and its energy consumption profile. \nUnder the same project, there is the objective of implementing a pilot project of a smart city in \n\n\u00c9vora, where it is expected to be possible to study the integrated management of the \ndecentralized energy production, the intelligent charging systems for electric vehicles and the \nconsumption management using smart meters.  \n\n \n \n\nSpain [65] \n\n \nBetween the years of 2010 and 2020, is expected the large deployment of electric vehicles, \n\naiming a 10% of the car fleet on electric vehicles.  \nIt is expected the introduction and deployment of an \u201ceco- labelling\u201d system. This system is \n\ndue to compare the carbon efficiency of different car categories in order to promote the uptake \nof low carbon vehicles.  \n\n\n\nAnnexes \n\n242 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nUnder the biofuels strategies, it is expected the introduction and generalization of E85 and \n\nB30 as fuel for captive fleets and their introduction into the Spanish fuels directive.  \nThere is also the objective of changing the current biofuel legislation to allow the usage of \n\nbiogas as transport fuel, in similar conditions as bioethanol and biodiesel.  \nIt is also expected to adapt before 2013 the public authority fleet into capable of running in \nhigher biofuel blends such as E85 and B30. This should reach a level of 50% adaptation of the \n\npublic administration fleet. \nBy 2013, it is expected to generalize the usage of E10 and B10 as mass market fuel, with the \n\npossible disappear of the gasoline protection grade.  \nIn what refers to the biodiesel under the article 21, the Spanish analysis showed the \nhypodissertation that in the end of the period 2011-2020, there is the possibility to reach a \n\nshare of utilization of around 2/3 of vegetable oils.  \nAccording to the Spanish NREAP, between the \u201cother\u201d biofuels, those which have more \n\npossibility to play an autonomy role are the biogas for transport, the HVO (hydrotreated \nvegetable oils) and the Bio-SPK (Bio-derived synthetic paraffinic kerosenes)  for aviation. \nUnder this category, there is also a national programme to support the technical development \n\nin the sector of second generation biofuels as well as biorefineries.  \n \n\n \nSweden [66] \n\n \n\nSince 2005 there was in place an incentive for the purchase of low emission vehicles for \npublic authorities.  \n\nThe government is currently revising and soon will be introduced the legislatio n to allow the \nincorporation of 10% bioethanol into gasoline and 6% biodiesel (FAME) into diesel.  \nCurrently there is support for the introduction of biogas cars and for the extension of the \n\ninfrastructure for the distribution of biogas as vehicle fuel. On August 2010, the Swedish \ngovernment together with the Energy Authority developed an inter-sectoral long term strategy \n\nto contribute for the increase use of biogas as vehicle fuel.  \nSeveral financial measures and legislations are already in place to support fuel and vehicles. \nAs an example, there are incentives for the establishment of pumps for usage of renewable \n\nfuels, vehicle tax (private and company cars), road traffic tax law, environmental cars for state \npurchase, parking benefits for low emissions vehicles, congestion taxes, investment support \n\nfor biogas. Here, after 2011, the vehicle taxes for car will start to be carbon indexed.  \nSweden is also promoting the energy research on renewable technologies. For example, there \nis a budget allocated to researc h on large scale renewable electricity production, its integration \n\nin the electricity network, electric drive and hybrid vehicles, and biofuels. Also, budget is \nexpected to be allocated to the demonstration and commercialization of new technologies such \n\nas the second generation biofuels, solar cells and biogas.  \nIt is expected that by 2030, Sweden has an automotive fleet which is independent of fossil \nfuels and presents zero net greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.  \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nAnnexes \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  243 \n\n \n\nThe United Kingdom [67] \n\n \n\nThe case of United K ingdom was one example of the non presentation of specific measures \n\napplied to the transport system, biofuels or electric vehicles.  \n \n \n\nAnnual overview \n \n\nAfter having a general overview of the main transport policies across the analyzed member \nstates, it was decided to create a picture of the incidence of the number of measures along the \ntime. The following chart provides an overview of the number of announced measures \n\naccording to the time scale, in units.  \n \n\n \nFigure 175 \u2013 [NREAP] Annual e vol ution of the number of measures. \n\n \n \nIt is possible to see that the agglomerate data for the analyzed countries shows a great \n\nincidence of measures for the period between 2008 and 2013, and a lack on the definition of \ntheir policies and measures for the years after 2014/2015.  \n\nHowever there is no information on this, but might be that the lack of information for the years \nafter 2014 is linked with the intermediate evaluation of the NREAPs progress that is required \nto be realized by 2014 by each Member State. By 2014 it is expected that all Member States \n\nshould report into the European Commission the deployment and progress status of their \npublished National Renewable Energy Action Plans, comparing that was announced in June \n\n2010 to the actual situation by 2014.  It should be reported the level of the compliance with the \nannounced strategy in 2010 and the need to reform or update their national strategy in order to \nmeet their announced 2020 objectives.  \n\n \nHaving this lack of transport information for the period between 2014 and 2020, the \n\ndevelopment of future scenarios for the transport sector appears as a crucial tool in supporting \n\n\n\nAnnexes \n\n244 Milton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  \n\n \n\nthe decision makers both at National and European level in order to decide, guide and ensure \n\nthat the Member States are on track to reach the announced national objectives.  \nThe Table 67 resumes the collected announced renewable energy shares on the electricity and \n\ntransport sectors by Member State.  \n \n\nTable 67 \u2013 [NREAP] Over vie w of the  announce d objecti ves.  \n\n \n\nCOUNTRY  \n2020 RES-FEC Target \n\nDirecti ve 2009/28/EC \n\n2020 RES-FEC \n\nAnnounce d Target \u2013 REAP  \n\n 2020 RES-E \n\nAnnounce d share - REAP  \n\nAustria  34%  34,2%  70,6%  \n\nBelgium  13 %  13,0%  20,9 %  \n\nBulgaria  16%  16,0%  20,6%  \n\nCyprus  13%  13,0%  16,0%  \n\nCzech Re public  13%  13,5%  14,3%  \n\nDenmark  30%  30,0%  51,9%  \n\nEs tonia  25%  25%  4,8%  \n\nFinl and  38%  38,0%  33,0%  \n\nFr ance  23%  23%  27%  \n\nGer many  18%  19,6%  38,6%  \n\nGreece  18%  18,0%  39,8%  \n\nHung ary  13%  14,7%  10,9%  \n\nIreland  16%  16%  42,5%  \n\nItal y  17%  17,0%  29,0%  \n\nLatvi a  40%  40%  59,8%  \n\nLithuania  23%  24%  21%  \n\nLuxe mbourg  11%  11%  11,8%  \n\nMalta  10%  10,2%  13,8%  \n\nNetherl ands  14%  14,5%  37,0%  \n\nPoland  15%  15,5%  19,4%  \n\nPortugal  31%  31,0%  55,3%  \n\nRomania  24%  24%  42,6%  \n\nSlovakia  14%  14%  24%  \n\nSlove nia  25%  25,3%  39,3%  \n\nSpain  20%  22,7%  40,0%  \n\nSwe de n  49%  50,2%  62,9%  \n\nUnite d King dom  15%  15,0 31,0%  \n\n\n\nAnnexes \n\n \n\nMilton Gr\u00e1cio Catarino  245 \n\n \n\nFigure 176 and Figure 177 show the gasoline and diesel country-by-country predictions till \n\n2020. \n \n\n \nFigure 176 \u2013 [NREAP] Gasoline pre dicti ons up to 2020. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 177 \u2013 [NREAP] Diesel pre dic tions up to 2020."}]}}}
