A escrita da presente tese nesta l\u00edngua representa assim um exerc\u00edcio apropriado que \n\npoder-se-\u00e1 revelar proveitoso no futuro.   \n\n No decorrer deste mestrado foram reunidas as condi\u00e7\u00f5es para a escrita de artigos cient\u00edficos \n\na submeter a revistas internacionais, raz\u00e3o pela qual a presente tese foi escrita sob a forma de duas \n\npublica\u00e7\u00f5es cient\u00edficas de acordo com o Art\u00ba 4 das Regras e Recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es Para a Elabora\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nDisserta\u00e7\u00f5es de 2\u00ba Ciclo (Mestrado) do Departamento de Biologia Animal. Desta forma visa-se \n\nacelerar o processo de elabora\u00e7\u00e3o dos manuscritos e suas subsequentes publica\u00e7\u00f5es. Cada um dos \n\nmanuscritos foi escrito de acordo com as instru\u00e7\u00f5es para autores das respectivas revistas cient\u00edficas \n\na que se pretende submeter. Especificamente, o 1\u00ba artigo segue as directrizes da revista \u201cJournal of \n\nMicrobiological Methods\u201d e o 2\u00ba artigo segue as directrizes da revista \u201cFungal Genetics and \n\nBiology\u201d. No entanto, para facilitar a leitura, e seguindo as normas do Art\u00ba 4 previamente referido, \n\nas figuras e tabelas foram inclu\u00eddas ao longo do texto.  \n\n As refer\u00eancias bibliogr\u00e1ficas da Introdu\u00e7\u00e3o Geral foram elaboradas segundo os par\u00e2metros \n\nda revista cient\u00edfica internacional, Nature. Esta \u00e9 uma das revistas mais relevantes na \u00e1rea da \n\nBiologia e possui um sistema de cita\u00e7\u00f5es c\u00f3modo para a leitura de textos de revis\u00e3o cient\u00edfica. \n\nAdicionando o seu elevado factor de impacto na sociedade cient\u00edfica, pareceu apropriada a escolha \n\ndesta revista como refer\u00eancia para a apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o da bibliografia.  \n\n\n\niv \n \n\nResumo  \n\nO caf\u00e9 \u00e9 considerado o segundo produto mais importante no mercado internacional a seguir \n\nao petr\u00f3leo, representando uma importante fonte de receitas e divisas para mais de 60 pa\u00edses \n\ncafeicultores, muitos dos quais classificados como pa\u00edses em desenvolvimento. A sua import\u00e2ncia a \n\nn\u00edvel econ\u00f3mico e social \u00e9 inquestion\u00e1vel, visto que centenas de milh\u00f5es de pessoas dependem, \n\ndirecta ou indirectamente, da sua ind\u00fastria (cultura, processamento, comercializa\u00e7\u00e3o, entre outros) \n\npara sobreviver. Actualmente, o mercado do caf\u00e9 \u00e9 considerado rent\u00e1vel e encontra-se em \n\ncrescimento. Por\u00e9m, pequenas perdas na produ\u00e7\u00e3o e qualidade deste produto, como aquelas \n\ncausadas por agentes patog\u00e9nicos, t\u00eam consequ\u00eancias socio-econ\u00f3micas nefastas para a maioria dos \n\npa\u00edses cafeicultores. Em casos extremos, as popula\u00e7\u00f5es destes pa\u00edses s\u00e3o mesmo privadas dos \n\ncuidados b\u00e1sicos (tais como alimentos, medicamentos) e vivem em condi\u00e7\u00f5es de vida bastante \n\nprec\u00e1rias. Deste modo, \u00e9 vital implementar estrat\u00e9gias que visem o aumento da \n\nprodutividade/qualidade do caf\u00e9 no mercado internacional e, ao mesmo tempo, protejam a sua \n\ncultura de doen\u00e7as epid\u00e9micas. Actualmente, v\u00e1rias destas doen\u00e7as atacam o cafeeiro, sendo de \n\ndestacar a ferrugem alaranjada, causada por Hemileia vastatrix Berkley and Broome, e a antracnose \n\ndos frutos verdes, causada por Colletotrichum kahawae Waller and Bridge pela sua import\u00e2ncia \n\necon\u00f3mica. A ferrugem alaranjada afecta pa\u00edses cafeicultores por todo o mundo, gerando perdas de \n\n30% se nenhuma medida de controlo for aplicada. Por outro lado, a antracnose dos frutos verdes \n\nencontra-se confinada ao continente Africano mas pode gerar perdas de produ\u00e7\u00e3o mais severas, de \n\nat\u00e9 80%. Neste trabalho, ser\u00e1 apenas abordada a problem\u00e1tica da ferrugem alaranjada.  \n\nH. vastatrix \u00e9 um fungo biotr\u00f3fico que depende das c\u00e9lulas vivas do hospedeiro para \n\ncompletar o seu ciclo de vida. A biotrofia caracteriza-se por um elevado grau de especializa\u00e7\u00e3o por \n\nparte do agente patog\u00e9nico, uma limitada actividade secretora, a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de um interface rico em \n\nhidratos de carbono e prote\u00ednas entre as membranas celulares do fungo e da planta, a supress\u00e3o das \n\ndefesas da planta e a indu\u00e7\u00e3o de genes do hospedeiro espec\u00edficos para o estabelecimento da \n\nbiotrofia, bem como a diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o de haust\u00f3rios. Os haust\u00f3rios s\u00e3o hifas especializadas, \n\nrespons\u00e1veis n\u00e3o s\u00f3 pela nutri\u00e7\u00e3o do fungo, mas tamb\u00e9m pela emiss\u00e3o/recep\u00e7\u00e3o de sinais entre a \n\nplanta e o agente patog\u00e9nico. A necessidade de compreender toda esta din\u00e2mica levou \u00e0 realiza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde v\u00e1rios estudos moleculares e bioqu\u00edmicos em diferentes organismos biotr\u00f3ficos tais como \n\nCronartium quercuum, Melampsora lini, M. larici-populina, Phakopsora pachyrhizi, Uromyces \n\nfabae, U. vignae, e Puccinia spp. Contudo, at\u00e9 \u00e0 data nenhum estudo semelhante foi realizado em \n\nH. vastatrix.  \n\n  O principal objectivo deste trabalho foi a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o e an\u00e1lise da express\u00e3o de diversos \n\n\n\nv \n \n\ngenes potencialmente envolvidos no estabelecimento e manuten\u00e7\u00e3o da complexa interac\u00e7\u00e3o H. \n\nvastatrix \u2013 C. arabica. Para atingir este objectivo, foi ainda efectuada uma valida\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00e9via de \n\ngenes de refer\u00eancia que possam ser utilizados na normaliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos dados de express\u00e3o g\u00e9nica, os \n\nquais poder\u00e3o constituir uma base para estudos an\u00e1logos em H. vastatrix. \n\n Actualmente v\u00e1rias t\u00e9cnicas podem ser utilizadas na quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o da express\u00e3o g\u00e9nica. O \n\nPCR quantitativo em Tempo Real \u00e9 a t\u00e9cnica de excel\u00eancia nesta \u00e1rea, devido \u00e0 sua simplicidade, \n\nsensibilidade e efici\u00eancia. No entanto, para que os valores de express\u00e3o sejam fidedignos e se \n\npossam realizar infer\u00eancias dos resultados com seguran\u00e7a, \u00e9 essencial uma correcta normaliza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndos genes de estudo. Antes de aplicar esta t\u00e9cnica, \u00e9 preciso atender ao facto que H. vastatrix \u00e9 um \n\norganismo biol\u00f3gico complexo, com certas particularidades, tais como a impossibilidade de crescer \n\nem cultura artificial (in vitro), o que pode dificultar muito uma correcta valida\u00e7\u00e3o dos genes de \n\nrefer\u00eancia. Por isso, foi necess\u00e1rio aplicar um passo adicional de normaliza\u00e7\u00e3o que permitisse \n\nestimar a quantidade do fungo presente nas folhas, durante o processo de infec\u00e7\u00e3o. O perfil de \n\nexpress\u00e3o de oito genes, descritos na literatura como genes de refer\u00eancia, foi analisado e a sua \n\nestabilidade determinada, com recurso a programas inform\u00e1ticos de vanguarda (GeNorm e \n\nNormFinder), em tr\u00eas conjuntos de dados distintos: in vitro (uredosporos germinados e apress\u00f3rios); \n\nin planta (estruturas de infec\u00e7\u00e3o p\u00f3s penetra\u00e7\u00e3o); in vitro+ in planta (conjunto de todas as \n\namostras). Apesar dos dois programas terem apresentado os mesmos resultados para cada conjunto \n\nde dados (in vitro, in planta, in vitro+ in planta), a combina\u00e7\u00e3o de genes mais est\u00e1veis diferia entre \n\ncada um deles. Assim, Cyt b, 40S_Rib e Hv00099 foram os genes mais est\u00e1veis para as amostras in \n\nvitro, enquanto 40S_Rib, GADPH e Cyt III foram os mais est\u00e1veis para as amostras in planta. Para \n\no conjunto das amostras (in vitro+in planta) os genes mais est\u00e1veis foram 40S_Rib, GADPH e \n\nHv00099. Apesar destas diferen\u00e7as, quando a express\u00e3o da prote\u00edna G? foi analisada utilizando os \n\nfactores de normaliza\u00e7\u00e3o espec\u00edficos ou o factor de normaliza\u00e7\u00e3o global (o mesmo para todas as \n\namostras), foi obtido um perfil g\u00e9nico semelhante com apenas algumas diferen\u00e7as pontuais. \n\nConcluiu-se assim que ambas as estrat\u00e9gias permitiram obter uma normaliza\u00e7\u00e3o adequada, \n\nestabelecendo-se assim um conjunto de genes de refer\u00eancia para os estudos subsequentes de \n\nexpress\u00e3o g\u00e9nica, que constituem o objectivo principal deste trabalho. \n\n O perfil g\u00e9nico de onze genes potencialmente envolvidos no estabelecimento e manuten\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda biotrofia foi obtido e a sua fun\u00e7\u00e3o inferida com base em estudos funcionais realizados noutras \n\nferrugens. De acordo com a literatura, estes genes estavam envolvidos nos seguintes processos: i) \n\nmodifica\u00e7\u00e3o da parede celular do fungo para que esta n\u00e3o possa ser reconhecido pela planta (quitina \n\ndesacetilases-CH1 e CH2); ii) vias de sinaliza\u00e7\u00e3o (proteina G? e prote\u00ednas cinase mitogenicamente \n\nactivadas-MAPK); iii) transporte de amino\u00e1cidos (AAT1_2 e AAT3); iv) transporte e metabolismo \n\n\n\nvi \n \n\nde a\u00e7\u00facares (manitol desidrogenase-MADp1, transportador de hexose-HXT1p e invertase-INV); v) \n\ninterac\u00e7\u00e3o com a planta (prote\u00edna de ferrugem transferida-RTP1p).  \n\n A grande maioria destes genes revelou um perfil de express\u00e3o muito semelhante ao \n\npreviamente descrito para outros fungos patog\u00e9nicos, como por exemplo U. fabae, embora \n\ndiferen\u00e7as inesperadas tenham sido observadas para a quitina desacetilase, cujo aumento de \n\nexpress\u00e3o nas fases finais de infec\u00e7\u00e3o nunca tinha sido observado. MAPK tamb\u00e9m apresenta um \n\nperfil de express\u00e3o diferente do observado em outras ferrugens, uma vez que apenas \u00e9 activada ap\u00f3s \n\na invas\u00e3o do hospedeiro e n\u00e3o durante a forma\u00e7\u00e3o dos apressorios, como foi previamente descrito. \n\nEste resultado sugere que este gene possa estar especificamente envolvido no processo de \n\nestabelecimento e manuten\u00e7\u00e3o da biotrofia, no entanto estudos funcionais s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rios para uma \n\nmelhor compreens\u00e3o do verdadeiro papel desta enzima. Por outro lado, os genes envolvidos na \n\nnutri\u00e7\u00e3o do fungo, tanto no transporte de amino\u00e1cidos como no transporte e metabolismo de \n\na\u00e7\u00facares, t\u00eam um perfil de express\u00e3o semelhante ao de U. fabae, o que claramente sugere uma \n\nelevada conserva\u00e7\u00e3o nos genes respons\u00e1veis pela nutri\u00e7\u00e3o do fungo, durante o processo de \n\nbiotrofia. Finalmente, como esperado, a RTP1 s\u00f3 foi detectada nas folhas infectadas, o que \n\nclaramente sugere que tamb\u00e9m em H. vastatrix esta enzima pode estar envolvida na manuten\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nbiotrofia.  \n\nOs resultados apresentados neste trabalho permitiram pela primeira vez a quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nrelativa da biomassa de fungo presente nas folhas infectadas durante o processo de infec\u00e7\u00e3o. Visto \n\nque tal estrat\u00e9gia nunca foi aplicada, foi aberto um novo caminho para estudos de express\u00e3o n\u00e3o s\u00f3 \n\nem H. vastatrix, mas tamb\u00e9m para outros agentes patog\u00e9nicos de plantas com as mesmas limita\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ne dificuldades. Adicionalmente, desvendamos pela primeira vez alguns aspectos do processo \n\nmolecular envolvido na complexa interac\u00e7\u00e3o C. arabica - H. vastatrix. Este conhecimento poder\u00e1 \n\ncontribuir para o desenvolvimento de estrat\u00e9gias de controlo de doen\u00e7as bastante mais eficazes do \n\nque as aplicadas actualmente.  \n\n \n\n\n\nvii \n \n\nAbstract \n\nHemileia vastatrix, the causal agent of coffee leaf rust, is a biotrophic fungus with a worldwide \n\ndistribution, causing serious social and economic problems in coffee growing countries. Expression \n\nstudies may have a key role in unraveling the transcriptomics of this pathogen as well as its complex \n\ngene-for-gene-based interaction with the host. However, a proper normalization is required to obtain \n\nreliable results. In this way the expression stability of eight reference genes (GADPH, EF-1, ?-Tubulin, \n\nCyt III, Cyt b, Hv00099, Ubi, 40S_Rib) was analyzed and two strategies were defined as fit for \n\nnormalization. The first part of this work allowed the correct validation of reference genes to H. \n\nvastatrix. In the second part of this work, the gene expression profile of eleven H. vastatrix genes were \n\nanalyzed (CH1, CH2, G?-protein, MAP Kinase, AAT1_2, AAT3, INV, HXT1p, MAD1p, Asp_AT and \n\nRTP1p) for being putatively involved in the establishment and maintenance of the biotrophy. The \n\nexpression profile of chitin deacetylases (CH1 and CH2) and G?-protein revealed that these enzymes \n\nare involved in the establishment of the biotrophy during the early stages of infection. However, up \n\nregulation of CH1 in late infection stages in H. vastatrix is unparalleled in other rusts. The MAP kinase \n\ngene was only activated after host invasion and not during appressoria formation, unlike its \n\nhomologues in other fungi, suggesting that this gene could be specifically involved in the establishment \n\nof the biotrophy. Amino acid transporters (AAT1_2 and AAT3), Invertase (INV), Hexose transporter \n\n(HXT1p) and Manitol desidrogenase (MAD1p) present similar expression profiles to Uromyces fabae, \n\nsuggesting a fairly conserved process among rust fungi. Finally, the RTP1p seems to be highly \n\nexpressed in planta, but not in the in vitro phases, suggesting a similar function to U. fabae. Overall, \n\nour results have provided valuable insights at the molecular level to the current understanding of the \n\nbiotrophic interaction between H. vastatrix \u2013 C. arabica. \n\n \n\n\n\nviii \n \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAgradecimentos ................................................................................................................................... i \n\nNota pr\u00e9via ........................................................................................................................................ iii \n\nResumo ...............................................................................................................................................iv \n\nAbstract ............................................................................................................................................ vii \n\nPart I \nGeneral Introduction .......................................................................................................................... 1  \n\n1.The Host Coffea ................................................................................................................................ 2 \n\n 1.1 Economic importance ..................................................................................................... 3 \n\n 1.2 Taxonomy ........................................................................................................................ 3 \n\n 1.3 General characteristics  .................................................................................................. 4 \n\n 1.4 Origin and dissemination ............................................................................................... 4 \n\n2.

By the early eighteenth \n\ncentury, coffee industry spanned the globe, linking consumers in Europe (which subsequently increased \n\nin North America) with producers in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. This agricultural commodity has \n\nan estimated retail value of 70 billion dollars and its industry is perceived as prosperous. But, although \n\nthe coffee business is booming in consuming developed countries, recurrent price decreases cause \n\nimmense hardship to countries where coffee production is a key economic activity, as well as to the \n\nfarmers who produce it. As a consequence, during such periods of lower prices, life quality decreases \n\nconsiderably in developing countries that rely to a greater or lesser extent on its foreign exchange \n\nearnings for financing essential imports and services.  \n\nAn additional problem for coffee producing countries is the occurrence of major epidemic diseases \n\nsuch as Coffee Leaf Rust (or orange rust), caused by Hemileia vastatrix Berkeley and Broome, since it \n\nlimits the coffee production and increase the plight of farmworkers. Therefore, disease management has \n\nrevealed as one of the most important steps in the coffee production system. Over the last decades there \n\nhas been a marked shift away from the reliance on pesticides for disease control, towards a more \n\nintegrated approach using various methods, including the use of resistant varieties. However, an \n\nunderstanding of the biology of these pathogens is essential and increasingly regarded as one of the \n\nfoundations for the selection of sources of long-lasting resistance.  \n\nFocused on the genetic basis of H. vastatrix and its complex gene for gene interaction with the host, the \n\npresent work intends to identify some of the genes involved in the infection process of H. vastatrix as \n\nwell as to characterize their expression profiles, leading to a more informed deployment of resistant \n\nvarieties.  \n\nBefore presenting this work, a brief general introduction was made on the most relevant aspects of the \n\nhost, the pathogen, H. vastatrix, and the plant-pathogen interaction. Genes were selected in the \n\nliterature for their relevant role in the life and pathogenesis (or as reference genes) of other rust fungi, \n\nand homologues were searched in H. vastatrix using degenerated PCR primers derived from the \n\ncomparison of such gene sequences. This preliminary task is reported in the supplemental material of \n\nboth articles (genes used as reference genes are reported in the first article, while those involved in life \n\nand pathogenicity are reported in the second article). In the first article, an accurate normalization for \n\n\n\n2 \n\nReal Time Quantitative PCR is presented and the best reference genes selected. The second article uses \n\nthe previously validated reference genes to study the expression profile of genes involved in the \n\nestablishment and maintenance of a H. vastatrix \u2013 C. arabica compatible interactions.  \n\n1. The Host Coffea  \n\n 1.1 Economic importance  \n\nCoffee is the most important agricultural commodity, second only to oil in world trade1,2, and became \n\ncrucial for the economy of more than 60 developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America \n\n(Figure1)3,4,5. Currently, its cultivation, processing, trading, transportation and marketing provides \n\nemployment for hundreds of millions people worldwide4,5. In Ethiopia, for example, more than 700,000 \n\nfamilies are involved in coffee production and more than 25 million people depend on the coffee \n\nindustry, directly or indirectly, to survive4. Thus, even small losses in yield and quality of coffee \n\nproduction have high socio-economic consequences for the coffee growing countries, which often rely \n\non coffee revenues to sustainability. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAccording to the International Coffee Organization (ICO), coffee production in 2008/2009 was over \n\n128.1 million bags (1 bag = 60 kg) with a retail value of 70 billion USD 4, being Brazil, Vietnam and \n\nIndonesia, responsible for almost 60% of this value 4. From the total production, 75% comes from C. \n\nFigure 1. Coffee growing countries. \n\n\n\n3 \n\narabica (mainly from Latin America and East Africa) and the remaining from C. canephora and \n\nmarginally from C. liberica (mainly from Africa and Asia). Regardless of cultivated species, Africa is \n\nresponsible for 11% of the total world production, Asia and Oceania for the 26 % and Latin America \n\nfor 63 %4.  \n\nFinally, it is important to note that coffee production represents one of the few solutions to fight \n\npoverty in developing countries and thus, the maintenance of acceptable production levels is primal for \n\nthe life quality of millions of people. \n\n 1.2. Taxonomy  \n\nThe first botanical description of the coffee plant was made in 1713 by Antoine-Laurent Jussieu who \n\nclassified it as Jasminum arabicanum. Later, this classification was reviewed in 1731 by Linnaeus, \n\nwhich included it in the Coffea genus of the Rubiaceae family6. Cronquist, in 19887 made the more \n\nrecently taxonomic classification of the Coffea genus7. \n\nKingdom: Plantae \n\n Division: Magnoliophyta \n\n  Class: Magnoliopsida \n\n   Order: Rubiales \n\n    Family: Rubiaceae \n\n     Genus: Coffea \n\n \n\nAt the intrageneric level, Chevalier (1947), based on the geographical distribution and fruit \n\ncharacteristics, established four sectors for the genus Coffea: Paracoffea, Argocoffea, Mascarocoffea \n\nand Eucoffea8. However, with the implementation of new tools (molecular, biochemical and \n\ncytogenetic) a great progress has been made on the Taxonomic level9 . Currently, the genus Coffea \n\nencompasses two subgenera: Coffea subgen Coffea and Coffea subgen Baracoffea and 103 described \n\nspecies10,11. However, only two species are economically important: C. arabica, also known as Arabica \n\nCoffee and C. canephora also known as Robusta Coffee11.  \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n 1.3. General characteristics \n\nCoffea spp. grows in the tropical and sub-tropical countries (25\u00ba North-25\u00ba South), requiring very \n\nspecific environmental conditions for its production. Rainfall, sunlight, wind and soils are all important \n\nto produce a quality coffee, but the specific requirements vary according to the species grown1,12 C. \n\narabica is native to Ethiopian tropical forests and is adapted to the following conditions: Altitudes of \n\n1600-2800m, little seasonal temperature fluctuations (20-28\u00baC), and a well distributed rainfall (1600-\n\n2000mm) with a dry season lasting 3-4 months12. This specie is responsible for the production of the \n\nbest quality coffee, with lower caffeine content4.  \n\nC. canephora is native to the lowland forests of the Congo river basin, which extends up to lake \n\nVictoria in Uganda, and therefore is adapted to the following conditions: Altitudes of up to 1200m, very \n\nlittle seasonal temperature fluctuations (24\u00ba-26\u00baC), and rainfall higher than 2000 mm distributed over a \n\n9-10 month period12. This species is responsible for the production of a coffee with higher caffeine \n\ncontent, widely used in the production of soluble coffee4. \n\n 1.4. Origin and dissemination  \n\nThe history of coffee cultivation is incompletely documented with regards to the domestication of \n\ncoffee plants in Africa and their dispersal throughout the world by man 2. This event was characterized \n\nby successive reductions of diversity within the two subpopulations of wild coffee introduced from \n\nEthiopia to Yemen (575 AD)2,13,14. Further reductions in diversity were produced at the beginning of the \n\n18th century. Firstly, the Dutch East Indian Company stated to establish the coffee planting industry in \n\nIndonesia. Later, in 1710 a single plant from Java was introduced to the Amsterdam botanical gardens \n\nand some of the young seedlings obtained from this tree were taken to Suriname, onwards to French \n\nGuiana and from thence to Brazil. Subsequently, the coffee crop rapidly dispersed throughout most of \n\nthe suitable locations in Latin America, not only from sources within the continent but also from \n\nReunion island. In the African continent, despite being the place of origin of Arabica coffee, most of \n\nthe current commercial plantations have resulted from re-introductions mainly from South America and \n\nReunion2,13,14 Therefore, the history of domestication of coffee crops is recent and is characterized by \n\nseveral bottleneck events, which strongly narrowed down the genetic diversity of plants in cultivation \n\nthroughout the world, with obvious consequences on the emergence and spread of diseases. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n2. The pathogen Hemileia vastatrix \n\n 2.1. Economic Relevance  \n\nCoffee Leaf Rust (CLR), caused by H. vastatrix, is the most important disease of C. arabica, the most \n\neconomically relevant coffee species15,16,17,18. This disease may cause up to 30% yield losses in coffee \n\ncrops, if no control measures are applied18,19, which leads to economic losses of US$ 1-2 billion per \n\nyear5,20. Considering that most of the coffee producing countries are still in development, these losses \n\ncan be particularly burdensome and create severe economical distress. In this way, Coffee Leaf Rust \n\nhas been classified as one of the seven most important diseases and pests of tropical crops20.  \n\nOne of the most dramatic examples of its devastating potential occurred the nineteenth century in Sri \n\nLanka, where coffee plantations were ravaged, and in less than 28 years all coffee exports had stopped. \n\nThe losses were so devastating that the annual coffee production of Sri Lanka decreased from 42 \n\nmillion to 3 million kg. As a result, in 1890 almost every coffee plantation was abandoned21,22. \n\nCurrently, tea instead of coffee is produced in Sri Lanka and, the cup of tea, rather than coffee, has \n\nbecome a familiar part of the British culture.  \n\n 2.2. Taxonomy \n\nH. vastatrix was first described by Berkeley and Broome from C. arabica leaves in Sri Lanka. H. \n\nvastatrix has been classified in the Index Fungorum (www.indexfungorum.org) as:   \n\nKingdom: Fungi  \n\n Phylum: Basidiomycota \n\n  Class: Pucciniomycetes \n\n   Order: Pucciniales \n\n    Family: Incertae sedis \n\n     Genus: Hemileia \n\n      Species: Hemileia vastatrix \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\n 2.3. Origin  \n\nDespite being native of Ethiopia, H. vastatrix was first recorded in 1861 by a British explorer in the \n\nLake Vitoria (East Africa) 5,19,20,21. However, only in 1869 (Sri Lanka) it caused the first great epidemic. \n\nSince then, it has spread to most of the coffee growing countries worldwide in three waves. Between \n\n1870 and 1920, it spread through the coffee zones of the Indian Ocean Basin and the Pacific. In the \n\n1950 and 1960, it broke out in the burgeoning coffee farms of Africa Atlantic countries. Finally, it \n\ncrossed the Atlantic Ocean during 1970 and 1980, and spread throughout the coffee zones of South \n\nAmerica 5 20,21. \n\n 2.4. Genetic variability \n\nThe first race differentiation of H. vastatrix was carried out by Mayne (1932) in India, who \n\ndifferentiated the local rust samples into four physiologic races19 23. No other studies were made on the \n\nphysiological specialization of H. vastatrix until D\u2019Oliveira initiated a world survey of coffee rust races \n\nin 1952 in Portugal19. The work carried out at the Coffee Rusts Research Center (CIFC) enabled the \n\ncharacterization of about 45 rust races, which have been inferred based on Flor's gene-to-gene concept. \n\nCurrently, 9 virulence genes (v1-v9) of H. vastatrix were inferred based on nine genes (SH1-SH9)19,23.  \n\n 2.5. Life cycle \n\nIn nature, H. vastatrix produces only the uredinal, telial and basidial stages19,20 The dycariotic \n\nuredospores (asexual stage) germinate and infect the coffee leaves, being responsible for the \n\ndisease19,20,24. The teliospores are seldom in the coffee leaves and, like uredospores, could to be present \n\nin the pustules (spores release). This structure differentiates into basidiospores (sexual phase) after a \n\nmeiosis, but seems to be unable to infect the coffee leaves. The basidiospores of H. vastatrix germinate \n\non the surface of coffee leaves, but afterwards they are not able to invade the host. In this way, the \n\nfunction of teliospores and basidiospores in the life cycle of H. vastatrix remains unclear20,24.  \n\nDue to the inability of teliospores and basidiospors to invade the host, H. vastatrix is generally \n\nconsidered heteroecious (requires two host to complete its life cycle). However, the alternate host as \n\nwell as the aecial and pycnial stages of the pathogen remains unknown 20,24. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n 2.6. Dispersion \n\nThe dissemination process of H. vastatrix uredospores is deeply dependent on the wind and rain and \n\ninvolves the following processes: removal from the host, transport through the air, and deposition on a \n\nnew host25 26. Events such as winds and storms are responsible for the dissemination of spores at great \n\ndistances, while the rain, mainly the rain splash, is responsible for the spores dispersion at short \n\ndistances 21 20. The spread of spores by the rain splash has additional advantages, such as spore \n\nprotection from dissection and loss of viability in dry weather. Insects, birds, human and others \n\nanimals, may also come in contact with the infected leaves and become a disease vector. Special \n\nattention must be paid for men, since it is one of the most important vectors on the dissemination of the \n\ndisease throughout coffee crops worldwide 20,21,26. Currently, the dissemination from one continent to \n\nanother has been attributed to wind currents and transport of contaminated coffee seeds and other plant \n\nmaterial 20,21,25,26. \n\n 2.7. Infection process \n\nThe infection process of H. vastatrix begins with the host-surface recognition in which, the uredospores \n\nrecognize the chemical and physical properties of the plant surface and germinate, differentiating an \n\nappressoria over the stomata (Figure 2B)19. During germination, an optimal temperature of 24 \u00baC (20-\n\n30\u00baC) and the presence of water are crucial, otherwise, the entire process is aborted 20.  \n\nAfter the appressoria formation, the fungus penetrates the host through the stomata forming a \n\npenetration hypha that grows into the substomatal chamber (Figure 2C) 15,19,20. This hypha produces \n\ntwo thick lateral branches; each hypha with its branches resembles an anchor (Figure 2D). Each lateral \n\nbranch of the anchor differentiate into an haustorial mother cell (HMC) that gives rise to an \n\nhaustorium, which primarily infects the stomatal subsidiary cells (Figure 2E)15,19,27. The fungus \n\ncontinues it growth with formation of more intercellular hypha, including HMCs, and a large number \n\nof haustoria in the cells of the spongy and palisade parenchyma and even of the upper epidermis \n\n(Figure 2F)15,19,27. From 21 days after infection, a dense mycellium is observed below the penetration \n\narea and a uredosporic sorus protrudes like a \u201cbouquet\u201d through the stoma (Figure 2G)19. After all this \n\nprocess, the spores spread to new coffee leaves and the process restart once favorable conditions are \n\nmet.  \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n2.8. Symptoms  \n\nIn susceptible plants, the first symptom are small chlorotic spots on the lower surface of the infected \n\nleaves, followed by sorus release and premature fall of the leaves (Figure3.A and 3.B)5,21. This \n\npremature shedding weakens coffee trees and affects, year by year, the production of wood needed to \n\nbear the future crop. Usually, CLR does not kill the tree, but progressively weakens it, resulting in \n\nsevere die-back, since this process deprives the coffee plant from the vital nutrient obtained through the \n\nleaves via photosynthesis. The subsequent infection of new leaves after the fall of the older leaves are \n\nFigure 2. A) Appressoria differentiation over the stomata; B)Penetration hypha; C) Anchor;  \n\nD) Haustorial mother cell with haustoria E) Highly colonization tissues; F) Sorus like a \u201cbouquet\u201d \n\n\n\n9 \n\nvery common and sometimes cause a severe reduction on the yield of coffee berries5,21.  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n2.9. Control  \n\nChemical control, mainly using cupric fungicides, is the most widely used method to control CLR28. \n\nHowever, it has revealed some disadvantages when implemented, namely the economic costs directly \n\nassociated with fungicide purchase and application19,23,29. Moreover, in the rainy seasons, the chemicals \n\nare washed by the rain, losing their ability to suppress the host invasion 30 31 and forcing the farmers to \n\napply more fungicides. Thus, during low yield years, chemical control has to be carried out 2-3 times \n\nper year, while during the high yield years this application increase to 4-6 times for year28. However, \n\nmost of smallholders, who produce the majority of the Arabica coffee, are usually unable to carry these \n\nspray programs completely, decreasing the success of this control measure28.  \n\nAs compared to the chemical control, the cultivation of resistant varieties is a more sustainable disease \n\ncontrol strategy. Breeding programs have been developed on research centers worldwide, mostly \n\nsupported by resistant plant material selected and characterized at CIFC. This strategy has great \n\nadvantages such as lower costs for farmers, environmental sustainability, and theoretically a long-term \n\nsolution to coffee leaf rust19,23. Currently, several cultivars with high yield, good organoleptic \n\ncharacteristics, and a notable resistance to H. vastatrix have been developed. The H\u00edbrido de Timor \n\n(HDT, a natural hybrid between C. arabica and C. canephora) was the progenitor of varieties such as \n\nCatimor (Caturra x HDT), Sarchimor (Villa Sarchi x HDT) and Cavimor (Catuai x HDT) are successful \n\nFigure 3. Coffee leaf rust symptoms A) Small chlorotic spots on the lower surface of the infected \nleaves; B) Pustules of uredosporic sori on the lower side of the leaves. \n\n\n\n10 \n\nexamples of these breeding programs22. \n\nHowever, the coffee plant resistance may be overcame by the evolving pathogen, and thus \n\ndevelopmental studies with the aiming of better understand the pathogenicity of this harmful fungus \n\nand its interaction with the host are crucial, in order to improve the breeding programs and leading to a \n\nmore sustainable agriculture.  \n\n3. Plant-pathogen interactions \n\nPlants in nature are generally resistant to most pathogens.29. Plants have the ability to recognize \n\npotential invading pathogens and have developed various elaborate defense mechanisms to ward off \n\npathogen attack. At the same time, pathogens have developed strategies to compromise plant resistance \n\nmechanisms, in what must have been an evolutionary game of \u201cping-pong\u201d19,29. Some of these \n\nmechanisms are constitutively expressed and provide physical and chemical barriers while others are \n\ninduced only after pathogen attack19. The idea that successful pathogens suppress host defenses, and in \n\nsome instance redirect cellular processes to create an environment that is favorable for their \n\nproliferation is accepted and very common in biotrophic fungi like H. vastatrix29. However, for some \n\npathogens, the ability to suppress host defenses depends on the pathotype, which can be explained by \n\ngene-for-gene theory. \n\n 3.1.Gene-for-gene theory \n\nHalf a century ago, Harold Flor's historical landmark publication revealed that the interaction between \n\nflax and flax rust (Melampsora lini) is governed by single resistance (R) genes in the plant and \n\ncomplementary avirulence (avr) genes in the pathogen32,33,34,35,36,37. Based on this strictly genetic model \n\nof gene-for-gene resistance, many scientists envisaged R proteins as receptors that specifically bind to a \n\nmatching avr ligand, enabling recognition of the pathogen and subsequent elicitation of an array of \n\nplant defense responses that eventually lead to resistance32. In this case, the host and the pathogen \n\nestablish a incompatible interaction. By contrast, pathogen can evolve in order to avoid plant \n\nrecognition, leading to a late activation of plant defense mechanisms 33,37,38,39. In this case, pathogen \n\ncolonizes the host tissues, establishing an compatible interaction with the host.  \n\nCurrently, several avirulence genes were already identified and characterized in other pathosystems \n\nsuch as Tomato \u2013 Cladosporium fulvum, Arabidopsis-Peronospora parasitica and Arabidopsis-\n\n\n\n11 \n\nPseudomonas syringae, Flax- Melampsora lini38,67. For other pathogens such as H. vastatrix, despite \n\nstrong evidence of the presence of avirulence genes (classical genetics), their identification and \n\ncharacterization at molecular level has not been possible.  \n\n 3.2. Biotrophic lifestyle  \n\nRust fungi, such as H. vastatrix, establish a biotropic interaction with the host 40 41. In this kind of \n\nparasitism, pathogen feeds from living host cells, and the host as a whole suffers only minor damage \n\nover a longer period of time. Further, the pathogen is dependent on the living host plant to complete its \n\nlife cycle42. The advantage of this kind of parasitism is the unlimited access, through altered plant \n\ntranslocation patterns, to the plant nutrients43. However, current evidence suggests that biotrophy \n\nrequires an impressive degree of cellular interaction between plant and parasite, perhaps explaining \n\nwhy so few fungal pathogens exploit this type of parasitism43. Several studies conducted in order to \n\nbetter understand this type of parasitism establish the following properties as hallmarks of biotrophy: 1) \n\nObligate biotrophs are not culturable in vitro (although research in some rust fungi has enabled in vitro \n\ncultivation in some extent); 2) They form highly differentiated infection structures (; 3) They have \n\nlimited secretory activity; 4) They establish a narrow contact zone separating fungal and plant plasma \n\nmembranes; 5) They engage in a long-term suppression of host defense responses; 6) They form \n\nhaustoria (specialized hyphae that penetrates host cells) 19,40,41,42.  \n\nThe haustoria, due to its role in the establishment and maintenance of the biotrophy, have been studied \n\nfor plant pathologists, since their first description by Zanardini about 150 years ago41,44. Already in \n\nnaming these structures [fr. L. haurine (haurio, hausi, haustum): to drink, to draw] de Bary (1863) \n\npropose one of the possible functions for the haustoria - the uptake of nutrients from the host. However, \n\nknowledge about this key element of the obligate biotrophic lifestyle is still fairly scarce 40,41,44. The \n\nmain reasons for this are the preserving lack of functional transformation system for haustoria forming \n\nfungi and the fact that these organs are not formed in culture44. Molecular biology, however, opened a \n\nnew dimension to investigate the role(s) of haustoria41. In 1997, Hahn &amp; Mendgen45 developed \n\ntechniques for isolating haustoria from host leaves, allowing the identification of genes preferentially \n\nexpressed in the haustoria of Uromyces fabae (first haustorium-specific cDNA libray) 45. Currently, \n\nhaustoria have been documented as primary in the fungal survival, since they are responsible for \n\nnutrient uptake and information exchange between the host and pathogen40,41,42,44. Additionally, it must \n\nnot be recognized as foreign by the host, in order to avoid defense mechanisms, and should be capable \n\n\n\n12 \n\nto modify the host metabolism to ensure total access to its nutrients41. Finally, it is important to note \n\nthat haustoria are not truly intracellular: they breach the cell wall only and a newly formed host plasma \n\nmembrane (the extrahaustorial membrane) surrounds them, resulting in a close association of fungal \n\nand plant membranes, separated only by a thin fungal wall and an extrahaustorial matrix.  The \n\nextrahaustorial matrix is the site for translocation of nutrients and exchange of information, providing \n\nthe optimal conditions for the maintenance of the biotrophy40,41,44,46.  \n\n 3.3 Genes putatively involved in the establishment and maintenance of the biotrophy \n\nAs previously stated, biotrophy requires an impressive degree of cellular interaction between plant and \n\nparasite. In this way, rusts need to suppress host defense reactions, assimilate nutrients from the plant \n\nand reprogram the host's metabolic flow, in order to survive41. Several studies in rust fungi, mainly in \n\nUromyces fabae, began to unravel some genes involved in these processes. However, a long road still \n\nneeds to be traveled in order to understand all the strategies developed by the rust to survive.  \n\n  3.3.1 Suppression of host defense \n\nRust fungi, developed several mechanisms in order to avoid plant recognition and tolerate various \n\nstress factors induced by the plant during the early stages of the infection process. Currently, several \n\ngenes such as PIG 11 (Metallothionein), PIG 16 (cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases (P-450s)), chitin \n\ndeacetylase, G-Protein and MAP Kinase, were described as deeply involved in these processes. \n\nMetallothionein (PIG11), protects plant pathogen cells against toxic concentrations of heavy metals as \n\nwell as free oxygen radicals produced by the plant during the hypersensitive response47,48. P-450s \n\ncatalyze a variety of oxygenation reactions on a large spectrum of substrates. While some of them are \n\ninvolved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, such as hormones and toxins, the majority of P-\n\n450s are involved in detoxification of the pathogen when exposed to toxic plant metabolites45. Chitin \n\ndeacethylases, seems to be responsible for the conversion of chitin (cell wall component of pathogen \n\nable to be recognized by the plant) to chitosan. This strategy during the intracellular growth may \n\nprotect hyphae of plant pathogenic fungi from being lyzed by extracellular plant chitinases, since the \n\nchitosan is a poor substrate for plant chitinases49,50,51. The fungal G protein, mainly G? \u2013 protein, not \n\nonly plays a pivotal role in the regulation of several signaling pathways crucial to fungal survival, but is \n\nalso involved in fungal development and pathogenicity52,53,54,55. The MAP kinase pathway is one of the \n\nmost important signaling cascades regulated by G? - protein and has been associated, by several \n\n\n\n13 \n\nstudies, with fungal pathogenicity53,54. The critical importance of these enzymes was proved in studies \n\nwith Cryptococcus neoformans, Magnaporthe grisea, Cochliobolus heterostrophus and Fusarium \n\noxysporum, in which a single a mutation in G? \u2013 protein or MAPK led to an incorrect appressoria \n\nformation and a decrease/total loss of fungal pathogenicity56,57,58. \n\n  3.3.2 Nutrient uptake \n\nAs previously described, biotrophic fungi are entirely dependent on plant living cells to their growth \n\nand reproduction. In this way, nutrient uptake (sugar uptake and amino acid transport) is one of the \n\nmost vital process for these organisms and involves several genes such as Amino acid transport (AAT1; \n\nAAT2; AAT3), Hexose transporter (HXTP1), Invertase (INV), Manitol desidrogenase (MAD1p), Beta-\n\nglucosidases (BGL) and Glucokinase (GLK)41.  \n\nSince 1997, three putative secondary transporters of amino acids were identified and characterized in \n\nUromyces fabae. AAT1p, was recently characterized as a broad specificity amino acid secondary active \n\ntransporter with a main specificity for L-histidine and L-lysine. This amino acid transporter was \n\nexpressed at all developmental phases of Uromyces fabae, preferentially in the haustoria59. AAT3p, \n\nexhibits a substrate preference for L-leucine and the sulphur containing amino acids L-methionine and \n\nL-cysteine60. As AAT1 the expression of AAT3 does not seem to be restricted to haustoria60. Finally, a \n\nspecific subtract has not been identified for AAT2, but it is only expressed in haustoria61. Taken \n\ntogether it seems that amino acid uptake in U. fabae is not limited to hasutoria, but preferentially \n\noccurs in this structure41.  \n\nThe sugar uptake is a complex process that aims to nourish the fungus by the plant. In this way, \n\nbiotrophic fungi must be able to convert sucrose, the most abundant carbohydrate source produced by \n\nthe plant, in their own nutrient source. Studies in U. fabae began to unravel some of these processes as \n\nwell as the enzymes and sugars involved41. Since biotrophic fungi is unable to directly use sucrose as a \n\nnutrient source, the primary function of INV is the cleavage of sucrose into D-glucose and D-frutose62. \n\nAn additional source, at least for the D-glucose, could be a Beta- glucosidases, since this enzyme has \n\nthe capacity to use cellobiose, a breakdown product of cellulose, as a substrate, and consequently, could \n\nuse degradation products of the plant cell wall available for its nutrition63. Subsequently, this \n\nmonosaccharides (D-glucose and D-frutose) will be transfer into the haustoria by the HXT1p53. Once \n\ninside the haustoria, the monosaccharides will be converted into a nutrient source that can be used by \n\n\n\n14 \n\nthe pathogen. GLK1 and MAD1p have a crucial role in this process, since the first one converts D-\n\nglucose to glucose-6-phosphate, the direct source of energy, and the second one converts the D-frutose \n\nto manitol, the fungal storage compound41,64,65. Moreover, MAD1p and INV, seem to have an additional \n\nrole in the fungal survival and maintenance of biotrophy. In this way, MAD1p is also responsible for \n\nthe nutrient mobilization in germinating uredospores, allowing for fungal nutrition before the \n\nestablishment of the biotrophy (haustoria formation) and INV is responsible for the additional sucrose \n\nsupply at the infected leaves during all the developmental phases of the pathogen62,64 and it was also \n\nsuggested that fungal invertases present in the apoplast are able to limit export of carbohydrates from \n\nthe infected tissue via the phloem, conditioning the plant tissue for a conversion from source to sink62. \n\n 3.3.3 Reprogramming the host\u2019s metabolic flow \n\nSeveral studies, in Melampsora lini and Uromyces fabae, showed evidences that avirulence proteins \n\nfrom the rust fungi are recognized inside the plant cell. These proteins are also likely to be synthesized \n\nand secreted specifically by the fungal haustorium and must be transported from the extracellular \n\nmatrix across the host plasma membrane. The first gene detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus of host \n\ncells was detected in U. fabae66. RTP1 interferes with plant gene expression, but the molecular basis of \n\nthis interference remains unclear41. To understand the exact biochemical function of RTP1p in plant \n\ncells, complementary structural and molecular insights from the identified functional core of RTP1p are \n\nessential. It is therefore crucial to determine the 3D structure of RTP1p functional domain41. Regardless \n\nthe validation of these specific functions the role of RTP1p in the maintenance of the biotrophy is \n\nunquestionable. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPart II\n\n\n\n16 \n\nValidation of RT-qPCR reference genes for in planta expression studies in the obligate biotrophic \npathogen Hemileia vastatrix, the causal agent of coffee leaf rust \n \nAna Vieiraa,b, Pedro Talhinhasa*, Andreia Loureiroa, S\u00e9bastien Duplessisc, Diana Fernandezc, Maria do \nC\u00e9u Silvaa, Oct\u00e1vio S.

Expression \nstudies may have a key role unraveling the transcriptomics of this pathogen as well as its complex \ngene-for-gene-based interaction with the host. Real time Quantitative PCR is the golden standard for \ngene expression analysis, although an accurate normalization is essential for adequate conclusions. \nReference genes are often used for this purpose, but the stability of their expression levels requires \nvalidation under experimental conditions. Further, biotrophic fungi undergo important biomass \nvariations along its infection process in planta, which raises the need for an adequate method to \nnormalize the proportion of fungal cDNA in the total plant+fungus cDNA pool. In this work, the \nexpression profiles of eight reference genes (GADPH, EF-1, ?-Tubulin, Cyt III, Cyt b, Hv00099, Ubi, \n40S_Rib) were analyzed across 28 samples, obtained in vitro (germinated uredospores and appressoria) \nand in planta (post-penetration fungal growth phases), to determine the most stable reference genes. \nGene stability was assessed using the statistical algorithms incorporated in GeNorm and NormFinder \nsoftware. Cyt b, 40S_Rib and Hv00099 were the most stable gene for in vitro dataset, while 40S_Rib, \nGADPH and Cyt III were the most stable in planta. For the combined datasets (in vitro+in planta), \n40S_Rib, GADPH and Hv00099 were selected as the most stable. Subsequent tests on the G? - protein \nexpression showed that the reference genes selected for the combined dataset do not differ significantly \nfrom those selected specifically for the in vitro and in planta datasets. Our study provides tools for \ncorrect validation of reference genes in obligate biotrophic plant pathogens, as well as the basis for RT-\nqPCR studies in H. vastatrix. \n\nKeywords: normalization factor; housekeeping genes; basidiomycete fungal plant pathogen; Coffea \narabica. \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n\n1. Introduction  \n Gene expression analysis plays an important role in enhancing our understanding of the \nsignaling and metabolic pathways which underlie cellular and developmental processes (Hu et al., \n2009). Although several methods have been used to quantify gene expression, including Northern \nblotting, RNase protection assay, in situ hybridization and cDNA microarray technology, real-time \nquantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is considered the gold standard for quantifying gene expression, thanks to \nits sensitivity, specificity, dynamic range and high throughput capacity (Bustin et al., 2005; Fang et al., \n2006; Freeman et al, 1999; Udvardi et al., 2008; Walker et al., 2009). This technique can detect very \nlow quantities of a target transcript even if only a few copies are present in the sample (Wong and \nMedrano, 2005). However an accurate normalization is required to obtain a reliable quantification of \nthe transcript (Derveaux et al., 2010; Huggett et al. 2005; Thellin et al., 1999). \n\nUntil now, several procedures have been proposed to normalize RT-qPCR data such as sample \nsize, RNA total quantification, genomic DNA and artificial molecules (Cruz et al., 2009; Huggett et al. \n2005; Teste et al., 2009). However, none of them is appropriate for this technique, since they do not \ntake into account sample variations, such as differences in the quantity and quality of RNA, and \nefficiencies of reverse transcription or PCR (Cruz et al., 2009; Huggett et al. 2005; Teste et al., 2009; \nWalker et al., 2009). On the other hand, internal control genes (references genes) are the most \ncommonly used to normalize RT-qPCR data, though the success of this procedure relies on the \nappropriate choice of control genes (Dheda et al., 2005; Olsvik et al., 2005; Thellin et al., 1999). \nTypically, reference genes need to exhibit two major properties: firstly they should be essential for the \nmaintenance of cellular function and viability, and therefore should be constitutively expressed in all \ntissues; secondly, their transcription should not be affected by the conditions understudy (Derveaux et \nal., 2010; Dheda et al., 2005; Paolacci et al., 2009; St\u00fcrzenbaum et al., 2001; Thellin et al., 1999; Wong \nand Medrano, 2005). However, some evidences show that all genes seem to be regulated under some \nconditions and there are always some variations in transcript levels, so that none of the commonly \nexploited genes can be viewed as a universal reference gene (Dheda et al., 2005; St\u00fcrzenbaum et al., \n2001; Thellin et al., 1999). In many cases, the use of, a single reference gene is inadequate, and can \nproduce wrong biological conclusions (Dheda et al., 2005; Hu et al., 2009; St\u00fcrzenbaum et al., 2001; \nTeste et al., 2009). Additionally, gene expression studies as well as reference gene validations are \nmainly limited to human or classical laboratory organisms and non-model species often suffer from \nlack of background information available (Axtner and Sommer, 2009). For all these reasons, it is \nessential a careful evaluation of one or even more suitable reference genes prior to the determination of \nthe gene profiles, especially in non-model species. In this way, several programs like geNorm \n(Vandesompele et al., 2002) and NormFinder (Andersen et al., 2004) are often used. These methods are \nbased on different statistical algorithms aimed at choosing the most stable reference genes, in order to \ncorrectly normalize the RT-qPCR results (Andersen et al., 2004; Pfaffl et al., 2004; Vandesompele et \nal., 2002). However, choosing the most suitable statistical method can be confusing, since each \nprogram has the potential to deliver different results. Thus, a combined analysis may be the best \nstrategy to follow.  \n\nActin, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH), Ribosomal genes (28S; 18S), \nElongation factor (ef1) and ?-tubulin are frequently used as reference genes for RT-qPCR without a \nproper validation, which may jeopardize the reliably of data (Bohle et al., 2007; Fang et al., 2006; Kim \net al., 2003; Nicot et al., 2005). \n\nIn fungi (and Oomycetes), the determination of the most stable genes for expression studies was \nonly carried out for a limited number of species such as Aspergillus niger (Bohle et al., 2007), \n\n\n\n18 \n\nMetarhizium anisopliae (Fang et al., 2006), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Teste et al., 2009) and \nPhytophthora parasitica (Yan and Liou, 2006). As expected, different reference genes were selected for \neach species: Actin, Secretion associated GTP-binding protein (sarA) and Cytochrome c oxidase \n(Cox5) were selected as the most stable genes in Aspergillus niger; in Metarhizium anisopliae, \nElongation factor (EF-1), GADPH and Tryptophan biosynthesis enzyme (tryp) were the most stable; \nthe ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Ubc), ? \u2013 tubulin (Tub-b) and 40S ribosomal protein (WS21) were \nthe most stable in Phytophthora parasitica; in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the most stable genes were \nthe Mannosyltransferase activity (ALG9), RNA Pol II transcription factor activity (TAF10), RNA Pol \nIII transcription factor activity (TFC1) and Ubiquitin-protein ligase activity (UBC6). However, to our \nknowledge, no such studies are published concerning rust fungi.  \n\n Rust fungi represent a large group of plant pathogens causing diseases on a variety of plants, \nincluding several important crops such as cereals, legumes and coffee (Kemen et al., 2005). Hemileia \nvastatrix is responsible for coffee leaf rust, a disease that can lead to yield losses of 30% if no control \nmeasures are applied (Azinheira et al., 2010; Mendgen, 2000; Nunes et al., 2009; Silva et al. 2006; \nTalhinhas et al., 2010). This pathogen establishes a biotrophic interaction with its host and is \ncompletely dependent of plant living cells to grow and reproduce (Mendgen, 2000; Silva et al. 2006; \nVoegele and Mendgen, 2003). Unlike other rust fungi, H. vastatrix is amenable for in vitro assays only \nin the early stages of its differentiation (corresponding to uredospore germination and appressoria \nformation), while further differentiation must be obtained in planta for experimental purposes \n(Azinheira et al., 2001). In coffee leaves, appressoria formed over stomata differentiate an infection \nhypha which invades the substomatic cavity, from which the fungus grows colonizing the leaf tissues \ninter- and intra-cellularly, feeding from living coffee cells by specialized structures named haustoria. \nThe infection cycle is completed with the formation of sporogenic hyphae and the release of \nuredospores, which occurs from 21 days after the infection (Silva et al., 2006). Therefore, the \nproportion of H. vastatrix biomass in planta increases along the infection process. This particularity \ncan be a problem when the aim of the study is the proper validation of reference genes. In this way, an \nadditional normalization step is necessary in order to successfully validate H. vastatrix reference genes \nfor in planta studies. It should be noted that, even though quantification of fungal pathogens is \nfrequently carried out by qPCR (Atallah et al., 2007; Mideros et al., 2009), including rust fungi \n(Acevedo et al., 2010; Jackson et al., 2006), the employment of this strategy for the validation of RT-\nqPCR fungal reference genes \u201cin host\u201d is still a novelty, as it has been reported very recently \n(Hacquard, Duplessis et al., accepted for publication in Physiological and Molecular Plant Pathology). \n\nThe main focus of this work was selecting potential H. vastatrix reference genes suitable for the \nnormalization of RT-qPCR data in the subsequent expression studies. For this, a methodology for \nnormalization of H. vastatrix nucleic acid content in planta was established, and eight genes from \ndifferent functional classes were selected for RT-qPCR primer design and validation as references to be \nused in H. vastatrix gene expression studies both in vitro and in planta. \n\n  \n\n\n\n19 \n\n2. Material and Methods \n \n\n2.1. Fungal and plant material  \n \n\nIn vitro growth: Fresh uredospores of the H. vastatrix isolate CIFC 1065 (race II) were spread in sterile \ndistilled water in petri dishes to germinate (GU - germinated uredospores sample) or inoculated on \nartificial oil-collodion membranes (Heath and Heath, 1976), to differentiate appressoria (A) (Azinheira \net al., 2001) and incubated during 24h under darkness at 24\u00baC.  \n\nIn planta growth: Both Caturra and Matari varieties of C. arabica were inoculated with fresh \nuredospores of H. vastatrix isolate CIFC 1065, establishing compatible interactions. The inoculation \nwas performed by spreading the uredospores (1 mg/pair of leaves) over the lower surface of young \ncoffee leaves. After an incubation period of 24 h in a dark moist chamber, the plants were moved to \ngreenhouse conditions. The leaves were collected at seven time-points after inoculation (18h, 24h, 48h, \n72h, 7D, 14D and 21D) in order to obtain in vitro+in planta of H. vastatrix. \n\nControls: Control material were ungerminated H. vastatrix uredospores (U), uninoculated young coffee \nleaves, and freeze-dried Lecanicillium sp. (formerly Verticillium sp.; an hyperparasite isolated from H. \nvastatrix uredospores) mycelia obtained upon culture in liquid medium (Potato Dextrose Broth, Difco, \nUSA). \n\nFungal and plant material were immediately frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C \nuntil RNA extraction. At each collection time, germination of spores, appressorium formation and \nfungal growth in host tissues were visualized by light microscope and evaluated as previously \ndescribed (Silva et al., 1999). \n\n \n\n2.2. Reference genes  \n \n\nCandidate reference genes represent three different functional classes (metabolism related, structure \nrelated and secretion related), reducing the chance that they may be co-regulated. They were selected \nfrom the literature, along with a new candidate gene (a predicted H. vastatrix secreted protein), selected \nbased on the stability of 454 pyrosequencing analysis between three datasets of H. vastatrix (Talhinhas \net al., 2010). The genes are: Elongation Factor (EF1-a) (Fang et al., 2006); ?-Tubulin (Tub) (Yan and \nLiou, 2006); Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GADPH) (Fang et al., 2006); Ubiquitin \n(Ubi); Cytochrome c Oxidase Subunit III (CytIII) (Bohle et al., 2007); Cytochrome b (Cyt) (Grasso et \nal., 2006); 40 S Ribosomal Protein (40S_R) (Yan and Liou, 2006) and a predicted H. vastatrix Secreted \nProtein (Hv00099). Sequences for these genes in H. vastatrix were obtained either from the \nemployment of degenerated PCR primers designed from homologous genes (including cloning using \nthe CloneJET PCR cloning kit (MBI Fermentas, Lithuania) in other rusts or from the H. vastatrix 454 \ndatasets (Table 1).  \n\n\n\n20 \n\nTable 1. RT-qPCR primer sequences and amplicon characteristics for control genes, including melting \ncurve analysis (arrows denote results for negative controls) tested in H. vastatrix samples in planta. EF-\n1 and ?-tubulin were amplified from H. vastatrix DNA based on the following degenerated primers \nobtained from homologous genes in U. fabae and M. lini: EF-1 forward, \nCBGARCGHGARCGTGGTATCAC; EF-1 reverse, TTVGADATACCRGCYTCRAATTCACC; ?-\ntubulin forward, ACHGGDGCTGGAATGGG; ?-tubulin reverse, \nTTNCCRATRAAHGTSACVGACATCTT. \n\n Hv00999 - unknown function \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\n2.3. RT-qPCR primer design and efficiency test \n \n\nThe primer design and choice of target sequence are essential steps to ensure a specific and efficient \namplification of the desired products. Primers were designed using PerlPrimer v1.1.17 (Marshall, 2004) \nwith melting temperatures of 60\u00b0C, lengths of 18-24 bp and GC content of 50\u201360%. Exon/intron \nboundaries were determined by aligning each cDNA sequence with its corresponding genomic \nsequence. Whenever possible (Table 1), primer were designed in the junction of two different exons, \nthus preventing amplification of a potential DNA contamination. However, this strategy was not \npossible to follow for four genes, where it would generate poor primer quality. Nevertheless, the \npresence of DNA in RNA samples was tested, as described under \u2018Total RNA isolation and cDNA \nsynthesis.  \nAdditionally, precautions have to be taken when working with a biotrophic fungus. Since this implies \nthat fungal cDNA will be mixed with plant cDNA for the in planta samples, primers have to be specific \nfor the fungus and cannot amplify the plant cDNA. Besides this, H. vastatrix can be hyperparasited by \nascomycete fungi from the genus Lecanicillium, which should neither be amplified.  \nTo avoid these problems, a blast tool-based strategy was followed (in silico strategy). First, sequences \nof the candidate genes obtained from H. vastatrix transcriptome and Sanger sequencing (using \ndegenerated primers), were used to search for homologous sequences in three data bases (NCBI \n(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/); HarvEST Coffee database (http://harvest.ucr.edu/) and Verticillium \ngroup database \n(http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/verticillium_dahliae/MultiHome.html)) with BlastN \nand BlastX tools. The homologous sequences obtained with the highest score were used as a template \nfor the alignment of primers developed, in order to assess their similarity. Only primers with more than \nfive bp differences were accepted. \n\nThe primer efficiency was experimentally tested with the LinRegPCR program developed by Ramakers \net al. (2003) which uses a linear regression analysis of fluorescence data from the exponential phase of \nPCR amplification to determine amplification efficiency (E). LinRegPCR software utilizes an iterative \nalgorithm (considering the number of data points, regression coefficient and slope of the regression \nline) for the selection of the exponential phase in each PCR amplification. We analyzed our \nfluorescence data (details of RT-qPCR experiments bellow) using this software and obtained E values \nfor each reaction. Additionally, a combined analysis using an average E value (arithmetical mean of E \nvalues of all samples) was applied and that value was used in subsequent analyses (Cikos et al., 2007; \nRutledge and Stewart, 2008).  \n\n \n\n2.4. Total RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis \n \n\nTotal RNA was extracted from frozen samples using the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany), \nwith addition of an in-solution DNase I digestion. Only RNA samples with 260 nm/280 nm wavelength \nratio between 1.9 and 2.1 and 260 nm/230 nm wavelength ratio greater than 2.0 before and after DNase \nI digestion were used for cDNA synthesis. The quality of RNA samples was also assessed by \nelectrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels. RNA quantity was determined by means of UV-VIS-\n\n\n\n22 \n\nspectrophotometry (Lambda EZ201, Perkin-Elmer, USA). A control PCR was run on extracted RNA \nsamples to check the absence of genomic DNA with the cytochrome b primers (Table 1). First-strand \ncDNAs were synthesized from 1 \u00b5g of total RNA in 20 \u00b5l final volume, using Omniscript RT kit \n(Qiagen) and oligo(dT)18 primer (MBI Fermentas) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For each \nsample, a final volume of 500 \u00b5l of cDNA was obtained and stored at -20\u00baC. \n\n \n2.5. Real-time Quantitative PCR \n \n\nThe RT-qPCRs were performed using an iQ5 real-time thermalcycler (BioRad, USA), based on \nEvaGreen\u00ae Supermix (BioRad). Each 15 \u00b5l reaction comprised 6 \u00b5l template, 7.5 \u00b5l EvaGreen \nSupermix, 0.4 \u00b5l of each primer (10 \u00b5M) and 0.7 \u00b5l of sterile distilled water. The reactions were \nsubjected to an initial denaturation step at 95\u00b0C during 10 min followed by 45 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15s, \n60\u00b0C for 20s and 75\u00baC 15s. A melting curve analysis was performed at the end of the PCR run over the \nrange 60-95\u00b0C, increasing the temperature in a stepwise fashion by 0.5\u00b0C every 10s. Baseline and \nquantification cycle (Cq) were automatically determined using the iQ5 Optical System Software. Three \nnegative controls (1-no template; 2- cDNA of plant; 3- cDNA of Lecanicillium sp.) were run to validate \nthe in silico strategy and ensure that only cDNA of H. vastatrix was amplified. Each PCR reaction was \nperformed in duplicate and the specificity of the amplicons was checked by melting curve analysis and \nby 2.5% agarose gel electrophoresis.  \n\n \n\n2.6. Assessment of expression stability \n \n\n2.6.1. Normalization of H. vastatrix genomic DNA \n \n\nFor normalizing the expression levels of H. vastatrix reference genes in the in planta samples \naccordingly to fungal biomass, genomic DNA was extracted from the same leaves used for the RNA \nassays, using the DNeasy Plant mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations \n(namely including a RNase treatment). Genomic DNA concentrations were estimated using the \nNanodrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific, USA), and samples diluted to 10ng/ul. Real-time quantitative PCR \nwas performed on these samples at the same conditions previously described, using primers for \nHv00099. The Cq results were used to normalize the Cq of reference genes using the following \nformula:  \n\n \n\nCq normalized = Cq cDNA reference genes -Cq DNA  Hv00099 (1) \n\n \n2.6.2. Determination of reference gene expression stability \n \n\nCq values were obtained (as mentioned under \u2018Real-time Quantitative PCR\u2019) for each reference gene \nfor all in vitro and in planta samples following the experimental design mentioned in \u2018Fungal and plant \nmaterial\u2019 and transformed into relative quantities as compared to ungerminated uredospores using the \n\n\n\n23 \n\n?Cq formula, (where ?Cq = Cq sample \u2013 Cq U and E is the efficiency of the primer pair) (Pfaffl, \n2001): \n\n Q = E^?Cq  (2) \n\n \nThe stabilities among the samples of the candidate reference genes were evaluated using Q values in \nprograms geNorm (Vandesompele et al., 2002), version 3.4 (Visual Basic application tool for Microsoft \nExcel retrieved from http://medgen.ugent.be/~jvdesomp/genorm/) and NormFinder (Andersen et al., \n2004) (a Microsoft Excel-based tool retrieved from www.mdl.dk/publicationsnormfinder) according to \nthe author's recommendations.  \n\n \n\n2.6.2.1. NormFinder \n \nNormFinder assesses the expression stability of a gene by evaluating its expression variation within \ntissues or treatments (\"groups\" in NormFinder terminology) compared to variation among \ntissues/treatments. The program algorithm implies the estimation of intra- and inter-group variation and \ncombines both results in a stability value for each investigated gene. The candidate gene with the \nlowest stability value is the most stable gene within the groups studied. The best combination of two \ngenes is also indicated. To select the best reference genes four datasets were run in this program. The \nfirst one, composed by the in vitro assays has two groups with four samples each. The second \ncomposed by H. vastatrix-C. arabica (Caturra) assays has two groups each one with six samples. The \nthird composed by H. vastatrix-C. arabica (Matari) assays has two groups each one with six samples. \nFinally, the last one composed for the in vitro+ in planta phases, have three groups one with eight \nsamples (in vitro assay) and the remaining (in planta assays) with twelve samples each (Andersen et \nal., 2004).  \n \n\n2.6.2.2. GeNorm \n \n\nGeNorm bases on the simple assumption that expression of two ideal reference genes will always have \nthe same ratio among samples regardless of the experimental conditions before the real-time PCR. The \naverage expression stability value M for each gene is calculated using the expression data. M is the \naverage pairwise variation of a gene compared with each of the other potential reference genes in one \nsample. The average M of all genes together is then calculated by stepwise exclusion of the least stable \ngene until the two most stable genes of the set remain that cannot be ranked any further. GeNorm also \nallows estimating the optimal number of reference genes which should be used for normalization. It \ncalculates the normalization factor (NF) based on the geometric mean of the expression of more than \none reference gene. The more reference genes included in this NF the less possible outliers account. On \nthe other hand using too many genes might include unstable reference genes making it less accurate. \nGeNorm calculates the Nfn for the two most stable reference genes based on the geometric mean of the \nexpression data and then the Nfn+1 with the next most stable gene. To determine how many genes \nshould be used for accurate normalization the pair-wise variation Vn/n+1 was determined out of two \nsequential normalization factors (NFn) and Nfn+1) (Vandesompele et al., 2002). \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\n3. Results and Discussion  \n \n\n3.1. How to successfully validate the reference genes to H. vastatrix \n \n\nAn accurate normalization requires the use of several reference genes whose expression changes \nmust be negligible under the investigated conditions. In this study we analyzed the gene expression \nprofile of eight candidate genes, described as good reference genes (Bhole et al., 2007; Fang et al., \n2006; Teste et al., 2009; Yan and Liou, 2006). RT-qPCR primers generated amplicons spanning 100-\n280 bp (Table 1) with GC content between 45\u201360% and no secondary structures. PCR efficiency \nranged from 1.92 to 2.033 and no amplification was obtained for any of the negative controls (no \ntemplate, plant or Lecanicillium sp. cDNA), as shown in Table 1. As ubiquitin was not expressed in all \nsamples, it was excluded from our analysis (data not shown). Taken together these results led to the \nvalidation of our \u201cin silico\u201d primer design strategy and ensured that the Cq value only reflects the \ntranscript abundance of H. vastatrix candidate genes. \nFor some genes, the Cq values of candidate genes span from 35 to 15 cycles along the infection process \n(Fig. 1). This dramatic variation in Cq values reflects the variations in the amount of fungal RNA \npresent in planta at each moment. This is clearly illustrated by similar variations in H. vastatrix DNA \ncontent in these samples (Fig. 1). Although in some points there are occasional changes often described \nin the reference genes, since their expression is seldom constant throughout the conditions under study \n(Andersen et al., 2004; Pfaffl et al., 2004; Vandesompele et al., 2002). Therefore, it becomes essential \nto use statistical tools like GeNorm and NormFinder to validate the best set of reference genes. \nHowever, these tools were developed to assess the stability of reference genes when the amount of \nRNA is similar under the conditions of the investigation (Andersen et al., 2004; Vandesompele et al., \n2002). So, in order to implement these programs to the H. vastatrix model, the Cq value obtained at \neach point normalized with DNA was used as an indirect input, instead of the original Cq value (1). It \nshould be noted that, this additional step of normalization is only crucial to choose the most stable \nreference genes being unnecessary in the subsequent expression studies in H. vastatrix. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2. Selection of the best candidate reference genes for RT-qPCR analyses  \nThe stability of seven candidate genes was evaluated using GeNorm and NormFinder algorithms using \nseveral datasets: 1- in vitro phases; 2- in planta phases using C. arabica (Caturra) as a host; 3- in planta \nphases using C. arabica (Matari) as a host; 4- in vitro+in planta. As shown in Fig 2 the results of both \nprograms were consistent, with only slight differences in the ranking order, except in the in vitro \nphases. For this dataset, GeNorm identified the ?-Tubulin and Cyt as the most stable combination of \nreference genes, while Normfinder identified Cyt and 40S_Rib as the best two reference genes (Fig \n2.A). The differences in rankings of gene stability using the two algorithms could be due to the fact that \nthey use very different methods to assess gene stability (Hu et al., 2009; Walker et al., 2009). GeNorm \nselects genes based on the pairwise variation between genes. The two most stably expressed genes are \ntherefore, those that share an expression profile (Vandesompele et al., 2002). In contrast, Normfinder \nuses a model based algorithm that takes into account overall stability as well as the stability of any \ngroups that may be present in the sample set (Andersen et al., 2004). However, these differences in \nselection of reference genes may not be significant, since all the candidate genes have a M value below \nthe default limit of 1.5, which is the top suitability threshold suggested by GeNorm (Vandesompele et \nal., 2002). In the in planta assays, despite slight differences in the ranking order, both programs select \n\nFig. 1. RNA transcription levels of reference genes tested, presented as Cq mean value in H. vastatrix samples \nwhen inoculated in C. arabica (A \u2013 Caturra, B - Matari).   \n\n\n\n26 \n\nthe same three genes (GADPH, Cyt III and 40S-Ribosomal) as the best reference genes to be used (Fig \n2.B and 2.C). In the fourth dataset, when analyzing in vitro+in planta as a whole, the ranking order of \nreference genes is the same for both programs (Fig 2.D). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nThe best pair matches with the best three reference genes chosen for the in planta dataset (GADPH and \n40 S_Rib), but the third most stable is different (Cyt III is replaced by the Hv00099). As in the in vitro \ndataset, both genes (Cyt III and Hv00099) have an M value lower than 1.5, suggesting that they may be \nused to normalize the conditions under study, even though Cyt III is more stable in the in planta dataset \nthan Hv00099. Thus, we conclude that in most cases the GADPH and 40S_Rib are the most stable \nreference genes while ?-tubulin and EF-1 are the least stable for all datasets.  \n\n \n\n3.3. Number of reference genes  \n \n\nAs Vandesompele et al. (2002) stated regarding the cost-benefit relationship of the normalization \nprocedure, there is a trade-off between practical considerations, such as time/costs, and accuracy. \nObviously an accurate normalization factor should not include rather unstable genes like EF-1 and ?-\nTubulin. On the other hand, if all genes are relatively stable, analyzing more genes than necessary can \nbe a waste of resources. In this way, it is essential to find the optimal number of reference genes, taking \ninto account a minimal of three genes with subsequent additions of reference genes until NF(n) and \nNF(n+1) have similar values. GeNorm has the ability to make this analysis automatically by calculating \n\nFig. 2. Gene expression stability values of the eight potential reference genes. The stability values on the right axis were \ncalculated with NormFinder (Andersen et al., 2004) (gray line) and the average expression stability values M (black line) on \nthe left axis were calculated with geNorm (Vandesompele et al., 2002) after stepwise exclusion of the least stable gene. \nGenes are plotted from the least (Red names) to the most stable expressed genes (green names). A) in vitro assays; B) H. \nvastatrix \u2013C. Arabica ( Caturra) (in planta); C) H. vastatrix \u2013 C. ar\u00e1bica (Matari) (in planta); D) in vivo + in planta assays \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nthe Pairwise variation values (V(n/n+1)) between each combination of sequential normalization factors \n(NF). Vandesompele and co-workers, recommended a cut-off value at 0.15, below which the inclusion \nof an additional control gene does not result in a significant improvement of the normalization. Yet this \nis not an absolute value and can change according to the data (Vandesompele et al., 2002). As shown in \nFig 3, the pairwise variation values, for the four datasets, are well above of the recommended cut-off \nvalue. However this value was established based on a spearman correlation between NF (n) and NF \n(n+1) in which low variation values, correspond to high correlation coefficients (Vandesompele et al., \n2002). Based on the same premise we perform a Spearmen correlation tests and obtained the following \nresults: in vitro (V3/4 =0.175391; r = 0.987578; p=0.000); in planta using C. arabica (Caturra) as a \nhost (V3/4= 0.316262, r = 0.972028, p=0.000); in planta  using C. arabica (Matari) as a host (V3/4= \n0.20654; r= 0.972028; p=0.000); in vitro+ in planta as a whole (V3/4= 0.308546; r= 0.975652 \np=0.000).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThese results show that the addition of a fourth reference gene for Normalization Factor does not \nprovide relevant information, so we can use only three genes to efficiently normalize the genes of \ninterest. However, as stated before the three most stable genes change between the in planta and in \nvitro samples, perhaps due to different condition to which pathogen is exposed. Table 2 summarizes the \nbests set of reference genes selected to each dataset analyzed.  \n\n \n\n3.4. The choice of the reference genes affects the normalization of a gene of interest \n \n\nTo understand how the choice of the reference genes affects the normalization of a gene of interest, the \nexpression of the G?- protein gene was analyzed during the infection process of H. vastatrix. The G?- \nprotein plays an important role in the establishment of a biotrophic interaction, since it is involved in \ndifferent signaling pathways (B\u00f6lker, 1998; Deising et al., 2000; Lev et al., 1999). Previous studies \nconfirmed that this enzyme is involved in appressoria formation and when mutated, some fungi lose \ntheir pathogenicity (B\u00f6lker, 1998; Deising et al., 2000; Lev et al., 1999). For this reason, it becomes \ncrucial to study the gene expression profile of this gene during all developmental stages of H. vastatrix. \n\nFig. 3. Optimal number of reference genes required for effective normalization. The pairwise variation \n(V(n)/V(n+1)) was analyzed between the normalization factors NF(n) and NF(n+1) by geNorm program to \ndetermine the optimal number of reference genes required for RT-qPCR data normalization. \n\n\n\n28 \n\nFig 4 presents the relative G?-protein expression levels when normalized with different methods: i) \nNormalization Factor validated for the in planta samples; ii) Normalization Factor validated for the in \nvitro samples; iii) Normalization Factor validated for the in vitro+in planta assays (global \nnormalization factor); iv) Worst Normalization factor (EF-1, ?-tubulin); v) a single reference gene as it \nis often used in expression studies (GADPH). \n\n \n in vitro in planta In vitro + in plant \n\nNormFinder Cyt, Hv00099, 40S_Rib 40S_Rib, GADPH, Cyt III 40S_Rib, GADPH, Hv00099 \n\nGeNorm Cyt, Tubulin, 40S_Rib 40S_Rib, GADPH, Cyt III 40S_Rib, GADPH, Hv00099 \n\nUsed in this study Cyt, Hv00099, 40S_Rib 40S_Rib, GADPH, Cyt III 40S_Rib, GADPH, Hv00099 \n\n \n \n\n Ratios of expression values were almost identical using the three best Normalization factors (compare \nblue, purple and pink bars). However, there are some inconsistent values among the 28 samples, \ndepending on which normalization factor was employed. For example, at 24 h for most assays, there is \na difference in 5 fold change between the best normalization factor to the in planta and best \nnormalization factor to the in vitro. A similar variation is observed in germinated uredospores. Despite \nthese slight differences in the absolute values, the gene expression profile is similar. So, we conclude \nthat the use of a stage-specific normalization factor (i.e., specific for in vitro or in planta samples) or a \nglobal normalization factor (same for all samples) are the best strategies to follow. Nevertheless, \nspecific normalization factor provide a more reliable expression profiles with higher costs, while the \nglobal normalization factor provides a similar results with lower costs. By contrast, when we compare \nany one of the best normalization factors with the worst, there are several differences in gene \nexpression profile (compare the black bar with the blue or violet or pink). In fact, at some times after \nthe inoculation, the use of this normalization factor led to a wrong biological interpretation. For \ninstance, the G?-protein expression is highest at early stages but with the worst normalization factor \nthis enzyme was not at all expressed. \n\n \n\nTable2. Best Normalization Factor selected from the different datasets  \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Finally, the expression profile of G?- protein when normalized with GADPH had a similar profile to \nthe best normalization factor (compare green with the blue, pink or violet bar), but with absolute values \nsignificantly higher than those obtained by a proper normalization factor, corroborating the previous \nstudies showing that a single reference gene is not enough to normalize the gene of interest.  \n\n \n\n4. Conclusions \n \n\nThis study provides the first reported assessment of reference genes for use in expression studies of H. \nvastatrix. Normalization is a critical factor in reporting RT-qPCR expression data, providing a \nnecessary control for error associated with sample preparation. Normalization using reference genes \nprovides a means of controlling this error, provided the gene(s) used are stably expressed across all \nsamples under investigation. The study described here tested 8 candidate reference genes across 28 H. \nvastatrix samples representing all developmental phases of this pathogen. We determine different \nNormalization factor for the in planta and in vitro samples that are statistically similar but differ in \n\nFig. 4. Effect of normalization strategies in the G?-protein expression profile. Normalization was performed using the i) Best \nNormalization Factor for the in vivo samples (40S_Rib, GADPH, Cyt III); ii) Best Normalization Factor to the in vitro samples \n(Hv00099, Cyt, 40S-Rib); iii) Best Normalization Factor for all developmental phases (40S_Rib, GADPH, Hv00099); iv) worst \nNormalization Factor (EF-1, ?-tubulin); v) a single gene often used as reference gene (GADPH).

We further developed a method for \nnormalization of in planta H. vastatrix samples to account for variations in fungal biomass along the \ninfection process. On the other hand, we proved that some reference genes commonly used such as Ef-\n1 and ?-Tubulin may give a wrong expression profile and would lead us to make wrong biological \nconclusions. Therefore, it becomes clear the importance of validating reference genes before studying \nthe gene of interest. Additionally, we conclude, even in biotrophic organisms, that the correct \nNormalization Factor is enough to determine the correct expression profile of the interest gene(s) and \nno additional normalization steps are required. To summarize, this work provides a set of pertinent \nreference genes that should be used for validation of expression data from RT- qPCR analysis or even \nmicroarrays experiments in H. vastatrix.  \n\n \nAcknowledgments: We would like to acknowledge the valuable comments and suggestions from \nDiogo Silva (Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o das Ferrugens do Cafeeiro/Instituto de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o Cient\u00edfica \nTropical, Oeiras, Portugal) and Tiago Jesus (Centro de Biologia Ambiental, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias da \nUniversidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal).

Portugal. \n \nAbstract \nCoffee Leaf Rust, caused by Hemileia vastatrix, is the most important disease of Arabica coffee (Coffea \narabica), prompting studies aimed at understanding the genetic basis of this pathogen as well as its \ncomplex interaction with the host. In this work, eleven H. vastatrix genes (CH1, CH2, G?-protein, \nMAP Kinase, AAT1_2, AAT3, INV, HXT1p, MAD1p, Asp_AT and RTP1p) putatively involved in the \nestablishment and maintenance of the biotrophy, were identified and their gene expression profile \ncharacterized. The expression profile of chitin deacetylases (CH1 and CH2) and G?-protein revealed \nthat these enzymes are involved in host-pathogen recognition and the establishment of the biotrophy \nduring the early stages of infection. However, up regulation of CH1 in late infection stages in H. \nvastatrix is unparalleled in other rusts. The MAP kinase gene was only activated after host invasion and \nnot during appressoria formation, unlike its homologues in other fungi, suggesting that this gene could \nbe specifically involved in the establishment of the biotrophy. Amino acid transporters (AAT1_2 and \nAAT3), Invertase (INV), Hexose transporter (HXT1p) and Manitol desidrogenase (MAD1p) present \nsimilar expression profiles to Uromyces fabae, suggesting a fairly conserved process among rust fungi. \nA strong up regulation of a homolog of the U. fabae rust transferred protein 1 (RTP1p) was found in H. \nvastatrix in planta structures, suggesting that it may also be involved in the establishment and \nmaintenance of biotrophy. Overall, our results have provided valuable insights at the molecular level to \nthe current understanding of the biotrophic interaction between H. vastatrix \u2013 C. arabica. \nKeywords: Real time quantitative PCR; Hemileia vastatrix; Coffea arabica; Biotrophy; fungal plant \npathogen. \n \n1. Introduction \nCoffee Leaf Rust, caused by Hemileia vastatrix Berk. &amp; Br., is the most important disease of Arabica \ncoffee (Coffea arabica), which represents 75% of the world coffee production (ICO, 2009). Currently, \nH. vastatrix occurs frequently with high severity in almost all regions worldwide where coffee is \ngrown, leading to serious social and economic problems (V\u00e1rzea and Marques, 2005). Therefore, \nstudies with the purpose of better understand H. vastatrix and its complex interaction with the host \nbecame crucial and have been conducted in Coffee Rusts Research Center (CIFC/IICT) for more than \n50 years (V\u00e1rzea and Marques, 2005). However, despite the development of resistant coffee varieties to \nrust, little is known at the molecular level about H. vastatrix  (Silva et al., 2006; V\u00e1rzea and Marques, \n\n\n\n \n\n2005). \n\nH. vastatrix is a biotrophic fungus, living in close contact with its host, and depends on living tissues \nfor growth and reproduction. Its growth begins with the host surface recognition, in which the \nuredospores recognize chemical and physical properties of the plant surface and germinate, \ndifferentiating appressoria over the stomata (Silva et al., 2006). The appressorium forms a penetration \nhypha that grows into the substomatal chamber. At the advancing tip of the penetration hypha two thick \nlateral branches are formed (anchor), and differentiate into a haustorial mother cell that gives rise to a \nhaustorium in the stomata subsidiary cells. Further on, the infection process involves heavy tissue \ncolonization and haustoria formation in mesophyl cells, culminating in spore releasing in bouquet-\nshaped uredinia, formed through the stomata (Rodrigues Jr. et al., 1975; Coutinho et al., 1993; Martins \nand Moraes, 1996; Silva et al., 1999). At the early stages of this process the plant can recognize the \nfungal cell wall components and activate the defense mechanisms. To avoid this recognition, the fungus \ndeveloped several strategies, such as modifying the cell wall surfaces for a compound that cannot be \nrecognized by the plant, allowing host invasion and fungal survival (Gueddari et al., 2002). \n\nHaustoria have been documented as a key in the establishment and maintenance of biotrophy, since \nthey are responsible for the nutrient uptake and information exchange between the host and the \npathogen. For this, they must not be recognized as foreign by the host, in order to avoid defense \nmechanisms, and should be capable of modifying the host metabolism to ensure total access to \nnutrients (Hahn and Mendgen, 2001; Mendgen et al., 2000; Voegele and Mendgen, 2003; Voegele and \nMendgen, 2010). These functions were proved in 1997 (Hahn et al., 1997), when the first haustorium-\nspecific cDNA library was developed for Uromyces fabae, allowing the identification of gene \npreferentially expressed in haustoria (PIGs). Since then, a number of genes preferentially or exclusively \nexpressed in haustoria have been identified and their encoded products characterized (for revision see  \nEllis et al. 2007; Voegele and Mendgen, 2010). For example, in U. fabae, genes involved in the \nsynthesis of vitamins (THI1, THI2 and THI3), sugar uptake (HXT1p, INV, BGL1p, GLK1, MAD1 and \nARD1p), aminoacid transport (AAT1p, AAT2p and AAT3p) and establishment and maintenance of \nbiotrophic lifestyle (RTP1p) were already identified (Voegele and Mendgen, 2010). However, despite \nall efforts, there is still a long road towards a better understanding of the full role of haustoria, even in \nrusts studied in detail as U. fabae. On the other hand it is also crucial to understand the mechanisms \ndeveloped by the rust at the early stages of the infection process, in order to avoid plant recognition and \ndefenses. The Chitin Deacetylases, G?- protein and MAP Kinase and others proteins, had been related \nto this process in several pathogenic fungi (Bolker, 1998; Deising et al., 2000; Gueddari et al., 2002; \nLev et al., 1999). Despite all the progress made to better understand the establishment and maintenance \nof the biotrophic lifestyle, additional studies will be required mainly in H. vastatrix where the \nmolecular processes is still poorly investigated. \n\nTherefore, the aiming of this study was the identification and expression analysis of genes described as \nputatively involved in the establishment and maintenance of the biotrophy along the differentiation and \ninfection process of H. vastatrix, using the Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) method, described \nas a golden standard for gene expression analysis (Bustin et al., 2009; Derveaux et al., 2010; Kubista et \nal., 2006; Wong and Medrano, 2005). \n\n \n2. Material and Methods  \n \n2.1. Fungal and plant material \n \n\n\n\n \n\nIn vitro growth: germinated uredospores (GU) and appressoria (Ap) were obtained from fresh \nuredospores of H. vastatrix isolate CIFC 1065 (Race II). For the GU sample, the uredospores were \nspread in petri dishes containing distilled water and incubated for 18h at 24\u00baC in darkness. For the Ap \nsample, the uredospores were inoculated in artificial oil-collodion membranes (Azinheira et al., 2001), \nsprayed with water and incubated for 24h with 100% humidity at 24\u00baC. In vivo growth: The Caturra \nand Matari varieties of C. arabica were inoculated with fresh uredospores of H. vastatrix isolate CIFC \n1065 by spreading spores (1 mg per pair of leaves) with a camel hair brush over the lower surface of \nyoung coffee leaves. Distilled water was then sprayed on to the inoculated surface and the plants were \nkept for 24 h in a dark moist chamber (D\u2019Oliveira, 1954). The plants were then maintained under \ngreenhouse conditions. The leaves were collected at different times after inoculation (18h, 24h, 48h, \n72h, 7D, 14D and 21D) in order to represent the progression of infection and host tissue colonization. \nFungal and plant material were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u2013 80\u00baC.  \n \n2.2. Light microscope observations of fresh tissues \n \nFor each collection time, the germination of spores, appressorium formation or fungal growth in host \ntissues was evaluated by light microscopy. At 18h the leaf pieces were painted with transparent nail \npolish on the lower surface, which was allowed to dry and subsequently removed, stained and mounted \nin cotton blue lactophenol (Silva et al., 2002). Scoring of the germinated uredospores and appressoria \nformed was performed on a minimum of six microscope fields of 100 uredospores each per experiment. \nFor the remaining time-points, cross sections of infected leaf fragments made with a freezing \nmicrotome (CM1850, Leica) were stained and mounted in cotton blue lactophenol (Silva et al., 1999) \nto evaluate fungal post-penetration stages. Data was recorded from 60 infection sites per experiment. \nThese data were presented as the combined values of two experiments because no significant \ndifferences were found between them. Arcsine-transformed percentages and Student and Fisher Least-\nSignificance-Differences tests were used for the statistical analysis. \n \n2.3. Strategies applied to the identification of genes of interest \n   \nGenes of interest were selected from the literature, mainly form U. fabae, according to their role in the \nbiotrophic interaction. In this study we analyzed the expression profile of eleven genes putatively \ninvolved in the pathogenicity of H. vastatrix to C. arabica, which may be responsible for: i) \nestablishment of the biotrophic lifestyle (Chitin deacetylase 1 and 2); ii) signaling pathway (G?- \nprotein and MAP Kinase); iii) synthesis of protein (Asp_AT); iv) sugar uptake (HXT1p, MAD1p and \nINV); v) aminoacid transport (AAT1, AAT2 and AAT3); vi) establishment and maintenance of \nbiotrophic interaction (RTP1p). As previously stated, none of these genes were characterized in H. \nvastatrix, so the first step was to identify and isolate them. To achieve this, we used two different \napproaches: design of degenerate primers based on homologous genes from other rust fungi followed \nby cloning and Sanger sequencing (data not sohwn); or specific primer designed based on sequences \nfrom 454 transcriptome pyrosequencing recently obtained for H. vastatrix (Talhinhas et al., 2010). \n \n \n2.4. RT-qPCR primer design and efficiency \n \nPrimers were designed using PerlPrimer v1.1.17 (http://perlprimer.sourceforge.net) (Marshall, 2004) \nwith melting temperatures of 60\u00b0C, primer lengths 18-24 bp and 50\u201360% GC content (Table 1). The \ngenerated amplicons spanned 75-360 bp with GC content between 45\u201360%. Exon/intron boundaries \nwere determined by aligning each cDNA sequence with its corresponding genomic sequence. \nWhenever possible, primers were designed in exon-exon junctions, to avoid amplification of potential \n\n\n\n \n\nDNA contaminations. As H. vastatrix is unable to grow in the absence of the host, RNA extracted from \nthe infected leaves is a mix of plant and fungal RNA. This implies that primers have to be specific for \nthe fungus and cannot amplify the plant. Additionally, H. vastatrix samples can be infected by \nLecanicillium spp., an hyperparasite fungus, which also must not be amplified. To avoid these \nproblems, an in silico method previously developed (Vieira et al., 2010) was applied and the most \npromising primers were used. \nThe primer efficiency (Table 1) was tested with the LinRegPCR program (Ramakers et al., 2003) which \nuses a linear regression analysis of fluorescence data from the exponential phase of PCR amplification \nto determine amplification efficiency (E). We analyzed our fluorescence data for each primer (RT-\nqPCR details bellow) and obtained E values for each reaction. The arithmetical mean of E values \nobtained was calculated and the Emean value used in the subsequent analysis (Cikos et al., 2007; \nRamakers et al., 2003; Rutledge et al., 2008).  \n \n2.5. Total RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis \n \nTotal RNA was extracted from frozen samples using the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany), \nwith addition of an in-solution DNase I digestion. Only RNA samples with 260 nm/280 nm wavelength \nratio between 1.9 and 2.1 and 260 nm/230 nm wavelength ratio greater than 2.0 before and after DNase \nI digestion were used for cDNA synthesis. The quality of RNA samples was also assessed by \nelectrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels. RNA quantity was determined by means of UV-VIS-\nspectrophotometry (Lambda EZ201, Perkin-Elmer, USA). A control PCR was run on extracted RNA \nsamples to check the absence of genomic DNA with the cytochrome b primers (Table 1). First-strand \ncDNAs were synthesized from 1 \u00b5g of total RNA in 20 \u00b5l final volume, using Omniscript RT kit \n(Qiagen) and oligo(dT)18 primer (MBI Fermentas, Lithuania) following the manufacturer\u2019s \ninstructions. For each sample, a final volume of 500 \u00b5l of cDNA was obtained and stored at -20\u00baC. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 1. (next page) RT-qPCR primer sequences and amplicon characteristics for genes under study, \nincluding melting curve analysis tested in H. vastatrix samples in planta \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n2.6. RT-qPCR \n \nThe RT-qPCR was performed using an iQ5 real-time thermalcycler (BioRad, USA), using EvaGreen \nSupermix (BioRad). Each 15 \u00b5l reaction comprised 6 \u00b5l template, 7.5 \u00b5l EvaGreen Supermix, 0.4 \u00b5l of \neach primer (10 \u00b5M) and 0.7 \u00b5l of sterile distilled water. The reactions were subjected to an initial \ndenaturation step at 95\u00b0C during 10 min followed by 45 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15s, 60\u00b0C for 20s and 75\u00baC \n15s. A melting curve analysis was performed at the end of the PCR run over the range 60-95\u00b0C, \nincreasing the temperature in a stepwise fashion by 0.5\u00b0C every 10s. Baseline and quantification cycle \n(Cq) were automatically determined using the iQ5 Optical System Software. Three negative controls \n(1-no template; 2- cDNA of plant; 3- cDNA of Lecanicillium spp.) were run to validate the in silico \nmethod and ensure that only cDNA of H. vastatrix was amplified. Each PCR reaction was performed in \nduplicate and the specificity of the amplicons was checked by melting curve analysis and by 3% \nagarose gel electrophoresis. \n \n2.7. Relative quantification  \n \nThe Relative quantification of genes of interest was calculated using the following formula (Pfaffl, \n2001):  \n \nFold change = E target\n\n ?Ct target (Control \u2013 Target)/ E NF \n?Ct NF (control- target)  \n\n \nWhere E is the average efficiency of the analyzed primer pair, NF is the Normalization factor \npreviously described (Vieira et al., 2010) and the control stage represents the resting uredospores. As \nsuggested by Vieira et al. (2010), the use of speicifc normalization factors for the in vitro and in planta \nsamples, or a global normalization factor (for both in vitro and in planta samples) seem to be the best \nstrategies to follow in the H. vastatrix model. In this study, different normalization factors, were used \nfor the in vitro and in planta assays, in order to assure the use of the best reference genes from each \ndataset. Thus, for the in vitro samples we use NF in vitro assays (putative Specific Secreted Protein \n(Hv00099); Cytochrome b (Cytb) and 40 S Ribossomal Protein (40S_R) and for the in vivo samples we \nused NF in vitro assays (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GADPH); Cytochrome c \nOxidase Subunit III (CytIII); 40 S Ribossomal Protein (40S_R)). The mean and standard deviation of \nbiological replicates was calculated using the mathematical methods previously described (Willems et \nal., 2008).   \n \n3. Results and Discussion  \n \n3.1 Fungal development during the infection process \n \nThe percentage of germinated uredospores and appressoria was evaluated 18h after the inoculation and \nno significant differences were observed between the two coffee varieties. In Caturra and Matari assays \nrespectively, 90% and 86% of the inoculated uredospores had germinated and, from these, 45% and \n50% had successfully differentiated into appressoria. \nFor each collection time (24h, 48h, 72h, 7D, 14D, 21D) the fungal growth inside host tissues was \nevaluated by light microscopy (Fig. 1). In both coffee varieties, the majority of appressoria gave rise to \npenetrations, reaching sequencially the stages of penetration hypha, anchor and haustorial mother cell \n(HMC) with haustoria. From 72h after the inoculation, the infection sites in which the fungus reached \nthe stage of HMC with haustoria were observed in higher frequency and that value significantly \n\n\n\n \n\nincreased until 14D. At this time, the fungus densely colonized the host mesophyl cells, beyond which \nthe entanglement of the intercellular hyphae originated by different infection sites did not allow the \nquantification of fungal growth stages. \nThese results suggest that regardless of the analyzed hosts, H. vastatrix seems to have a similar \ndevelopment within leaves, allowing, the comparison of the expression profiles obtained for the \nselected genes between the two hosts. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3.3.

When the amount of \nthe target gene was above the sensitivity threshold of RT-qPCR, all of the selected primer sets showed \nspecificity H. vastatrix. However, in some samples, the target gene was not present in suitable amounts \nto perform our analysis. This could be due to a combination of low expression levels and a low \nproportion of H. vastatrix RNA in the early stages of infection in planta (Vieira et al., 2010). \n \n3.4. Gene expression profiles: establishment of the biotrophy \n \nIn order to establish a biotrophic interaction, rusts need to suppress or evade host defense reactions, \nallowing its survival. As previously stated, the growth of H. vastatrix begins with the host surface \nrecognition, in which the fungus has to recognize chemical and physical properties of the plant surface \nto begin the host invasion (Silva et al., 2006). On the other hand, the plant can recognize the fungal cell \nwall components and activate its defense mechanisms, preventing fungal growth (Gueddari et al., \n2002). To avert plant recognition, the biotrophic fungus has developed several strategies, some of wich \nwill be addressed in this work, being Chitin deacetylases, G? \u2013 Protein, and MAP kinase crucial for this \nprocess. The expression profiles of two Chitin deacetylases (CH1 and CH2; Fig. 2A) showed a peak of \nactivation by 24h, reducing thereafter to undetectable levels at 7D in CH2 or between 48h and 7D in \nCH1, returning to high expression levels at 14 and 21D. These results highlight that the conversion of \nchitin to chitosan, as well as the increase of chitin deacetylase activity, only begins after the host \ninvasion, coinciding with the pathogen penetration of the plant tissue by 24h (Deising and Siegrist, \n1995; Hahn and Mendgen, 2001; Kafetzopoulos et al., 1993; Mendgen et al., 1996).These strategies of \navoiding plant recognition and hypha lyses by extracellular plant chitinases enable fungal survival \n(Deising and Siegrist, 1995; Gueddari et al., 2002; Hahn and Mendgen, 2001; Mendgen et al., 1996). \nMoreover, previous studies in U. fabae show an increase in enzyme activity during the penetration \nphases (Deising and Siegrist, 1995; Mendgen et al., 1996) which supports the first peak observed in our \nresults. The expression increase in the advanced stages of leaf infection could be related with the onset \nof the production of sporogenic hyphae and new uredospores. However, functional studies will be \nrequired to better understand this event. \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nG?\u2013protein showed two peaks of activation, the first during the uredospore germination and the second \nin the early stages of the infection process (Fig. 2B). During the former stage a similar activation peak \nhas been observed in Colletotrichum trifolii, although, in this case, after the host invasion the amount \nof transcript decreased to residual levels (Truesdell et al., 2000). In other pathogenic fungi, using \ndifferent mutants of G?\u2013protein, deletions on this enzyme resulted in loss of virulence and growth \ndefects, such as incorrect appressoria formation (Bolker, 1998; Deising et al., 2000; Li et al., 2007; Yu, \n2006). Given the obtained expression profile, our results support the pivotal role of this enzyme in the \nregulation of several signaling pathways crucial for a correct appressoria formation and for the \nunfolding of the subsequent infection process. However, the expression increment during the early \nstages of penetration/haustoria formation process suggests that G?-protein may also be involved in the \nestablishment of the biotrophy.  \n\nMAP kinase showed a higher gene expression in the early stages of the in planta colonization (Fig. 2B) \ndecreasing in late stages. In most of the studied fungi, this enzyme is part of a complex signaling \npathway regulated by G? protein and has been associated with the appressoria formation and hypha \ndifferentiation (Bolker, 1998; Deising et al., 2000; Di Pietro et al., 2001; Lev et al., 1999; Li et al., \n2007). However, according to our results, the MAP Kinase under study does not seem to be involved in \nfungal germination or appressoria formation, but its expression increases during the formation of the \nfirst haustoria, suggesting the overlay with the establishment of the biotrophy in the early stages of \npost-penetration phases. Probably this enzyme is only activated after the host penetration, however \nfunctional studies are required.  \n\nTaken together, these results suggest that these enzymes are involved in the early stages of fungal \ngrowth and host-surface recognition system. In this way, the expression profile obtained for the Chitin \n\nFig.2. Expression profile (fold change) of genes involved in the establishment of the biotrophy at each \ncollection time compared to resting uredospores. (A) Chitin deacetylases (CH1 and CH2). (B) \nSignalling pathway (G? \u2013 protein and MAP Kinase).  \n \n\n\n\n \n\ndeacetylases, G? \u2013 protein and MAPK suggest the crucial role of these enzymes in the success of the \ninfection either to overcome the host defence reactions or in the establishment of the biotrophic \nlifestyle in H. vastatrix. \n \n3.5. Gene expression profiles: nutrient uptake \n \nAs previously stated, the maintenance of a biotrophic interaction is deeply associated with the role of \nhaustoria, not only in the nutrient uptake but also in the suppression of host defense responses and/or \nreprogramming the host\u2019s metabolic flow (Voegele and Mendgen, 2010). Several genes, previously \ndescribed in a haustorial cDNA library of U. fabae, play a key role in the nutrient uptake, both in sugar \nmetabolism and in amino acid transport (Hahn and Mendgen, 2001; O\u2019Connell and Panstruga, 2006; \nPanstruga, 2003; Voegele, 2006; Voegele and Mendgen, 2003). Currently, three putative amino acid \ntransporters (AAT1p, AAT2p and AAT3p) are identified in U fabae with different amioacid specificities \nand expression locations (Hahn et al., 1997; Struck et al., 2002; Struck et al., 2004). However, in a \ncDNA library of H. vastatrix (Talhinhas et al., 2010), only two genes showed homology to those amino \nacids transporters. The first (AAT1_2) is homologous to U. fabae AAT1p and AAT2p and the second \n(AAT3) to AAT3p. Besides the in vitro structures, both amino acid transporters (AAT1_2 and AAT3) \nwere only detected in heavily colonized leaf tissues (14D and 21D). The AAT1_2 expression profile \nwas similar to U. fabae, while the AAT2p and AAT1p genes are exclusively/preferentially expressed in \nthe parasitic phase (haustoria) (Hahn et al., 1997; Struck et al., 2002). However, in U. fabae AAT3p is \nexpressed during all growth phases, instead of only on heavily colonized tissues (Struck et al., 2004). It \nseems that the capacity for amino acid uptake in both rusts is fully induced only during biotrophic \ngrowth, although for H. vastatrix it occurs from 14D on while, for U. fabae occurs during the infection \nprocess, mainly in the haustoria. Interestingly, in Trichoderma reesei, a gene encoding a putative amino \nacid transporter was found to be induced by mycelial wall fragments of the host fungus Rhizoctonia \nsolani (Vasseur et al., 1995). Similar to the both rust, a signal from the host organism might induce \nmorphological and physiological events related to parasitic functions. However, the high Cq values \nregistered for AAT3 at 14 and 21D suggest that, if similar or lower levels of expression were occurring \nin earlier infection stages, then the lower proportion of fungal RNA in the total RNA extracted in such \nstages would be bellow the sensitivity threshold of RT-qPCR.  \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe sugar uptake is also closely associated with the fungal nutrition and seems to be limited to the \nhaustoria (Voegele and Mendgen, 2010). Several studies in U. fabae started to provide a more complete \nview of the enzymes and sugars involved in this process (Voegele and Mendgen, 2010). In this study, \nwe analyzed the gene expression profile of genes homologous to U. fabae described as pivotal to this \nprocess: invertase (INV), hexose transporter (HXT1p) and malate dehydrogenase (MAD1p). All these \nenzymes seem to be related with the use of sucrose (most abundant carbohydrate sources produced by \nthe plant) as a nutrient source for the pathogen (Hahn and Mendgen, 2001; Mendgen et al., 2000; \nO\u2019Connell and Panstruga, 2006; Panstruga, 2003; Voegele, 2006; Voegele et al., 2001; Voegele and \nMendgen, 2003; Voegele and Mendgen, 2010). INV was activated during all the growth phases of H. \nvastatrix (Fig. 3B), preferentially at the heavily colonized tissues (14 and 21D). Our expression results \ngave a similar profile to U. fabae, therefore a similar function can be inferred (Voegele et al., 2006). \nThis enzyme is responsible not only for the cleavage of sucrose into D-glucose and D-frutose (sugars, \nsubsequently transferred into the haustoria), but also for an additional sugar supply to intercellular \n\nFig.3. Expression profile (fold change) of genes involved in the aminoacid transport (A), sugar uptake \n(B) and protein synthesis (C) at each collection time compared to resting uredospores.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nhypha since the fungal invertases present in the apoplast could limit the export of carbohydrates from \nthe infected tissue via the phloem, conditioning the plant tissue for a conversion from source to sink \n(Voegele et al., 2006). In this way, the pathogen constantly ensures its nutrient source. HXT1p, \nputatively responsible for the sugar transport (D-glucose and D-frutose) into the haustoria, was only \ndetectable in late infection phases (14 and 21D) with relevant activation levels. A similar profile was \nobserved in U. fabae, where this gene seems to be almost exclusively expressed in haustoria. The high \nexpression levels are also in accordance with the previous studies since this gene represents 1.2% of \nhaustorial RNA of U. fabae and is among the highest frequencies found in the haustorium-specific \ncDNA library (Doehlemann et al., 2005; Reifenberger et al., 1997; Voegele et al., 2001). MAD1p was \ndetected in all stages, with a steady increase of expression as the infection progresses, reaching the \nhighest values at the heavily colonized leaf tissue phases (14 and 21D). This enzyme, converts D-\nfrutose to manitol (storage compound, normally used by the fungus not only as a nutrient source but \nalso as a mean to avoid the oxidative stress resulted from the defense reactions) (Clancy and Coffey, \n1980; Jennings et al., 1998; Voegele et al., 2005). Additionally, it is responsible for the nutrient \nmobilization in germinating uredospores, allowing fungal nutrition before the haustoria formation \n(Voegele et al., 2005). Taken together, these results suggest that the role of these enzymes in nutrient \nuptake has been a fairly conserved process in the biotrophic fungi considered (U. fabae and H. \nvastatrix). Intriguingly, this is in spite of a relatively low homology of these proteins between each of \nthese pathogenic species (data not shown). \n\nThe expression profile of Aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) was analyzed due to its relevance in the \nmost basic processes of H. vastatrix. For many species, AspAT belongs to the aminotransferase \nsubgroup and is involved in the transfer of amino groups (Botton and Dell, 1993; Nakai et al., 1999). In \nH. vastatrix, this enzyme was more expressed in ungerminated and germinated uredospores as \ncompared to appressoria and to the in planta phases (Fig 3C), suggesting that this enzyme is not \nnecessary for the establishment and the maintenance of the biotrophy. Therefore, future functional \nstudies are required to better understand the role of this enzyme in this complex system. \n \n3.5. Gene expression profiles: maintenance of the biotrophy \n \nRust fungi can suppress host recognition by transferring proteins from haustoria into plant cells. \nRTP1p, from U. fabae, was the first gene detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus of host cells (Kemen et \nal., 2005). In H. vastatrix cDNA library, four genes homologous to U. fabae were identified, however \nwe have only selected for expression studies the one with highest homology score. As can be seen in \nFig. 4A, the RTP1p seems to be highly expressed in planta (48h-21D after the inoculation) but not in \nthe in vitro phases, which is expected since this gene was detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus of host \ncells. RTP1 interferes with plant gene expression, but the molecular basis of this interference remains \nunclear. To understand the exact biochemical function of RTP1p in plant cells, complementary \nstructural and molecular insights from the identified functional core of RTP1p are essential. It is \ntherefore crucial to determine the 3D structure of RTP1p functional domain. Regardless the validation \nof these specific functions the role of RTP1p in the maintenance of the biotrophy is unquestionable. \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe expression patterns of genes putatively involved in the establishment and maintenance of the \nbiotrophic interaction enhance our comprehension on the genetic basis of H. vastatrix and may pave the \nway for better understanding the complex interaction between H. vastatrix \u2013 C. arabica. This will \ncontribute for a more informed deployment of resistant varieties in coffee crops, and thus leading to a \nmore sustainable agriculture in the countries where the coffee is the major source of resources. \n \n \nAcknowledgments: We would like to acknowledge the valuable comments and suggestions from \nDiogo Silva (Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o das Ferrugens do Cafeeiro/Instituto de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o Cient\u00edfica \nTropical, Oeiras, Portugal) and Tiago Jesus (Centro de Biologia Ambiental, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias da \nUniversidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal).

For this purpose, fungal genes putatively involved in the \n\nestablishment and maintenance of the complex biotrophic interaction between C. arabica \u2013 H. vastatrix \n\nwere identified and their gene expression profile characterized. No such studies had been previously \n\nconducted in H. vastatrix and expression studies by RT-qPCR are also innovative in rust research. \n\nMoreover, it was developed a method to normalize the proportion of fungal cDNA in the total \n\nplant+fungus cDNA pool, since it is impossible to dissociate H. vastatrix from the host during the \n\nbiotrophic phase enabling the validation of reference genes for subsequent RT-qPCR studies. The \n\nemployment of this strategy for the validation of RT-qPCR fungal reference genes \u201cin host\u201d stills seems \n\nto be a novelty. \n\nDetailed in vitro and in planta studies enabled the selection of specific normalization factors for each of \n\nthese experimental conditions, although a global normalization factor (merging in planta and in vitro \n\nassays) was as informative. as the specific factors when analyzing the expression profile of the G?-\n\nprotein.  Genes involved in signaling, establishment of biotrophy, transport and metabolism were \n\nidentified in H. vastatrix showing homology to genes previously identified in other rust fungi. Further, \n\nexpression revealed that H. vastatrix shares similar patterns of expression with U. fabae for most of \n\nthese genes, although intriguing differences were recorded for a chitin deacetylase, whose up regulation \n\nin late infection stages in H. vastatrix is unparalleled in other rusts. Also, the MAP kinase gene studied \n\nseems to be only activated after the host invasion and not during appressoria formation, unlike its \n\nhomologues in other fungi, suggesting that this gene could be specifically involved in the establishment \n\nof the biotrophy. On the contrary, the genes involved in nutrient uptake studied here revealed fairly \n\nconserved profiles between U. fabae and H. vastatrix), in spite of a relatively low homology of these \n\nproteins. A strong up regulation of a homolog of the U. fabae rust transferred protein 1 was found in H. \n\nvastatrix in planta structures, suggesting that it may also be involved in the establishment and \n\nmaintenance of biotrophy. \n\nResults obtained in this work suggest that future studies would benefit from the use of techniques \n\naiming to enrich samples in fungal material, such as the Laser Capture Microdissection, which may \n\n\n\n54 \n\nenable more accurate quantification of low copy transcripts particularly in samples representing the \n\nearly stages of in planta colonization. The results obtained further suggest the usefulness of expanding \n\nof the RT-qPCR approach to address the expression profiles of other genes, based on the literature \n\nconcerning other rust fungi and in the recent H. vastatrix EST libraries obtained by 454 pyrosequencing \n\nrepresenting germinated uredospores, appressoria and advanced stages of coffee leaf tissue \n\ncolonization. On the other hand, more detailed studies for selected genes can provide important insights \n\ninto the coffee-rust interaction, namely functional studies using heterologous gene expression and \n\nhistopathological studies focused on immunolocalization of secreted proteins. \n\n\n\n55 \n\nReferences \n\n1.
