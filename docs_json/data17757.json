Nineteen spectra of standard samples previously defined in ternary diagram by mixture design\nwere prepared and mid-infrared diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded. The partial least squares\n(PLS) regression method was applied to the model. The spectra set was preprocessed by either\nmean-centered and variance-scaled (model 2) or mean-centered only (model 1). The results based\non the prediction performance of the external validation set expressed by RMSEP (root mean square\nerror of prediction) demonstrated that it is possible to develop good models to simultaneously\ndetermine calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate and magnesium oxide content in powdered\nsamples that can be used in the study of the thermal decomposition of dolomite rocks.\n\nKeywords: dolomite, DRIFTS, partial least squares, multivariate regression, ternary mixture\ndesign\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe reserves of carbonate rocks in the state of Rio\nGrande do Sul - Brazil, are mainly constituted by dolomite-\nlike rocks (MgO content ? 18%), while calcite-like rocks\n(MgO content &lt;4%) occur in a smaller proportion. It is\nassumed that, in volume, only 18% of the calcareous rocks\nare calcite-like (used mainly in cement production) and\n\n82% are dolomite-like and are used mainly in the correction\nof soil acidity and in the production of lime.\n\nThe search for a solution to the suppressed demand\nof raw materials by turning dolomite into calcium-rich\ncarbonate and magnesium oxide, which are thoroughly\nused in industrial processes impelled the development\nof a physical process of dissociation of dolomite-like\nrocks, in order to obtain these two different products.\nThe basic idea of the process is a fractionated calcination\nof a dolomite-like rock, composed mainly of Ca and Mg\n\n\n\n595Multivariate Regression Models for the Simultaneous Quantitative AnalysisVol. 00, No. 00, 2006\n\ncarbonates (52% and 40% approximately),1 at a given\ntemperature and a complete calcination process that\nresults in a mix of calcium carbonate combined with\nmagnesium oxide in the same material.\n\nThe lack of specific methodologies2-6 that allow the\njoint analysis of the mix of obtained products from the\nfractionated calcination of the dolomite-like rocks led to\nthe development of a technique that enabled the\nquantitative analysis of calcium carbonate and magnesium\noxide by means of Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier\nTransform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS).\n\nSeveral studies that use infrared spectrometry have\nbeen carried out in the last few years in order to\nqualitatively and quantitatively determine organic and\ninorganic compounds in soils and rocks.7-11 Among these\nstudies, special attention has been given to those\nemploying mid-infrared (DRIFTS)12-14 and near-infrared\n(NIRRS) reflectance.15-16\n\nThis is a non-invasive method of analysis that allows for\nthe quantification of the main components in the mix of\ngenerated products in one measurement, with a high degree\nof reliability.17 The determination of the contents in the mix\nis very important for the quality control of the calcination\nand separation processes. Furthermore, the evaluation method\nalso allows the control of final quality of the singular products\ngenerated after the extraction process.\n\nThe partial least squares (PLS) regression method18-25\n\nis an outstanding method of multivariate regression usually\napplied to ternary systems, especially when preceded by\na robust factorial design.26,27 Furthermore, there are many\nsoftware packages that include the PLS regression method\nas a routine treatment of spectral data as obtained by\nDRIFTS.28-31\n\nThe present paper proposes the use of the DRIFTS-\nPLS method to determine the concentration in weight of\ncalcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate and magnesium\noxide. The major advantages are that these analyses do\nnot require extensive sample preparation,32 are non-\ninvasive, and do not produce residues that are harmful to\nthe environment.\n\nExperimental Design\n\nMixture design has been used throughout this work in\norder to model the ternary system, which is composed of\nthe following analytes: calcium carbonate, magnesium\ncarbonate and magnesium oxide. Nineteen mixtures were\ndistributed along the ternary diagram presented in Figure\n1. These mixtures will be used to develop the multivariate\nregression models. Other six mixtures, represented by tiny\nlight letters, were selected to compose the validation set.\n\nSamples\n\nPowdered samples of calcium carbonate, magnesium\ncarbonate and magnesium oxide were used in order to\nprepare a set of standard mixtures with different\nconcentrations according to the mixture design. Calcium\ncarbonate was supplied by FERTISUL, located in the\nstate of Paran\u00e1, in southern Brazil, magnesium carbonate\nwas donated by UNISINOS, located in the state of Rio\nGrande do Sul, in southern Brazil, and commercial\nanalytical-grade magnesium oxide was supplied by\nVETEC.\n\nAfter the mixture was made, each component percentage\nwas recalculated, and the final values are presented in Table\n1. The calcium carbonate content varied between 29.99 and\n70.00%, the magnesium carbonate content varied between\n0.00 and 49.99% and the magnesium oxide content, between\n0.00 and 40.03%. The same procedures were used with the\nexternal validation set samples.\n\nSpectra\n\nEach previously prepared standard was diluted in\nspectroscopic-grade KBr at a ratio of 1:49. The mid-\ninfrared reflectance spectra were recorded from 4000 to\n450 cm-1 with an FT-IR NICOLET spectrometer MAGNA\n550 according to Table 2 parameters and using a diffuse\nreflectance accessory EasiDiff\u2122 PIKE Technologies, Inc.\nKBr (spectroscopic grade) was used as background and\nthe spectra were obtained in triplicate for each sample.\n\nThe same procedures were used with the external\nvalidation set samples.\n\nSoftware\n\nOMNIC E.S.P. v.3.1 was used to acquire the spectra\nand to calculate an average spectrum. TurboQuant v.1.1\nwas employed in the modeling.\n\nFigure 1.  Mixture design of ternary system of calcium carbonate, mag-\nnesium carbonate and magnesium oxide.\n\n\n\n596 Marder et al. J. Braz. Chem. Soc.\n\nModeling\n\nThe partial least squares (PLS) regression method was\nemployed on the modeling using the standard set. Briefly,\nspectra were pretreated by either mean-centered and\nvariance-scaled or mean-centered only.\n\nVariables selection\n\nPLS regression on the full spectra range was performed\non the nineteen standard spectra. The first three acquired\nlatent variables (LV) are presented in Figure 2. Throughout\nthe development of the calibration models the sub-regions\nwhere there was large LV\n\n2\n or LV\n\n3\n signal contribution were\n\nused and are presented in Table 3 and Figure 3.\nThe stepwise elimination algorithm33 was used to\n\noptimize the regions used in the models, and a coefficient of\ndetermination increase and PRESS (Predictive Residual Error\nSum Of Squares) decreases were used as selection criteria.\n\nEvaluating models\n\nThe six validation sample prediction errors were\n\ncalculated in order to compare the models beyond the\ncalculated coefficient of determination (R2) with the\ncalibration standards. Another adequate parameter used\nto simultaneously evaluate the six samples is called\nRMSEP (Root Mean Square Error Of Prediction), being\ncalculated according to expression 1.\n\n(1)\n\nwhere y\ni\n is the reference value for the i-th sample and y?\n\ni\n is\n\nthe predicted value for the same sample and n to the\nnumber of validation samples.\n\nTable 3.

Both models used the regions shown in Table\n3. It is worthwhile to note that there are regions selected\nby LV\n\n2\n and LV\n\n3\n criteria and not used in the optimization.\n\nA different region set was selected for each analyte.\nThe model that used mean-centered pretreatment is\n\ncalled model 1. In model 2 the mean-centered data were\nalso variance scaled.\n\nThe minimum PRESS was used in the calibration\nprocess together with the search for minimum RMSEP.\nFor model 1 those criteria give three latent variables\n(factors) for CaCO\n\n3\n and MgCO\n\n3\n and four latent variables\n\nfor MgO. For model 2, three latent variables were obtained\nfor all analytes.\n\n The 19 standard samples used for calibration yielded\ncoefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.954, 0.954\nand 0.989 for CaCO\n\n3\n, MgCO\n\n3 \nand MgO, respectively, in\n\nmodel 1; and 0.974, 0.967 and 0.959 in model 2, showing\na good linear correlation.\n\nThe prediction results for the validation set of the six\nsamples are presented in Table 4 for both models and\ncompared with the real values. Also presented in the table\nare RMSEP values for each analyte. These results can be\nconsidered quite reasonable for the both preprocessing\ntechniques.\n\nThe RMSEP values can be used to suggest that the\nprediction value for each analyte is better obtained when\nmodel 1 is used for MgCO\n\n3\n and MgO and model 2 for\n\nCaCO\n3\n.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this work it was demonstrated that it is possible to\ndevelop a model to be used in the study of the thermal\ndecomposition of dolomite rocks. It was possible to\nsimultaneously determine the three basic analytes: calcium\ncarbonate, magnesium carbonate\n\n \nand magnesium oxide\n\nby employing partial least squares regression methods in\nDRIFTS data.\n\nThe model that used the mean-centering technique\ngives better results for magnesium carbonate and\nmagnesium oxide, whereas a model that also included\nvariance-scaled data gives better results for calcium\ncarbonate.\n\nThis method is therefore ideal for monitoring the\ncalcination of dolomitc rocks and of other carbonate-rich\nrocks. The major advantages are that these analyses do\nnot require extensive sample preparation, are non-invasive,\ndo not produce residues that are harmful to the\nenvironment, and are less time-consuming, especially\nwhen used on a routine basis.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors acknowledge FERTISUL, located in the\nstate of Paran\u00e1, in southern Brazil, and UNISINOS, located\nin the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in south Brazil, for the\nsamples used in this work.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
