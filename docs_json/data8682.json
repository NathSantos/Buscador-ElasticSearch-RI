The dye was chemically immobili-\nsed on the surface of a bifurcated glass optical fibre bundle, using silanisation in organic media. \nIn FIA system, hydrogen carbonate or carbonate samples are injected in a buffer carrier solution, \nand then are mixed with phosphoric acid solution to generate CO2, which diffuses through a PTFE \nmembrane, in order to be collected in an acceptor carrier fluid, pumped towards to detection cell, \nin which the optode was adapted. The proposed system presents two linear response ranges, from  \n1.0 x 10 -3 to 1.0 x 10 -2 mol l -1,  and from 2.0 x 10 -2 to 0.10 mol l -1. The sampling frequency was \n11 sample h -1, with good repeatability (R.S.D &lt;4 %, n = 10). In flow conditions the optode \nlifetime was 170 h. The system was applied in the analysis of commercial mineral water and \nthe results obtained in the hydrogen carbonate determination did not differ significantly from \nthose obtained by potentiometry, at a confidence level of 95 %.\n\nKeywords: CO2, FIA, thymol blue, silanisation, pH-optode.\n\n1 - introduCtion\n\nQuantification of carbon dioxide is an im-\nportant parameter in areas such as medicine, envi-\nronmental and industrial process [1,2], principally \ndue to its important role in animal and plants meta-\nbolism and in the process of photosynthesis. Thus, \nmeasurement in vivo or in real time of blood PCO2  \nin intensive care units is considering an essential \nparameter in monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment \nof critically ill patients subject to surgery [1,2]. \nIn the atmosphere the CO2 presence is the result \nof plant respiration  (production) and photosyn-\nthesis (consumption). However, human activities, \nsuch as heading systems, transportation, industrial \n\ncombustion, etc., and natural phenomenas, such \nas burning and degradation of biomass or volca-\nnic eruptions, are responsible for much higher le-\nvels of this gas in some regions [3]. In this sense, \nCO2 analysis is considered an essential element of \nenvironmental research [2]. CO2 determination is \nalso vital in many biochemical industries, where \nit serves for the process control. The continuous \nanalysis of the fermentation process on line is cri-\ntical for high product yields, minimal unwanted \nmetabolic by products and an overall optimised \ncontrol strategy [2].\n\nWith the aim of CO2 determination, nume-\nrous analytical procedures are known in gases and \nfluids. Determination of CO2 can be accomplished \n\n\n\nEcl.

Generally, these metho-\ndologies are fast and produces reliably quantita-\ntive results. However, they are expensive, bulky \nand not very much robust. \n\n It is enough notorious than in all \nprocess for determination of CO2, measurements \nin continuous form will be very convenient. In this \naspect, flow systems become powerful tools; prin-\ncipally due to they are simple, reliable and allow a \nhigh sample throughput. For the other hand, che-\nmical sensors are excellent devices for coupled in \nflow systems. \n\n Between, the chemical sensors, \nthat based on optical fibres, are usually sensiti-\nve, robust, cheap and easily miniaturised [8], also \nthe optical sensors offer the possibility of remote, \ncontinuous, multianalyte analysis in low volume \nlocations [2]. Thus, for the CO2 determination \nnumerous optodes have been developed. Since \nthose reported by Zhujun and Seitz [9] and Optiz \nand L\u00fcbbers [10] in 1984, based on Severinghaus \nelectrode [11]. In these optodes [12-19], the CO2 \nmolecules diffuse through a hydrophobic membra-\nne, which separates the sodium bicarbonate buffer \ninternal solution from the sample, the carbon dio-\nxide is converted to HCO3\n\n- in the internal solution, \nchanging its pH, which one is followed by using \ncolorimetric or fluorescent pH indicators. Howe-\nver, the greater problems in these optodes are the \ninternal solution use to detect the pH variations, \nand the type of membrane used to separate the in-\nternal and the analysed solutions. Consequently, \nthese CO2 optodes present limited lifetime and \nlong response times [17] difficult their coupling \nin flow systems. \n\nDue to the drawbacks presented by the op-\ntodes based on Severinghaus principle, gradual \nconfigurations have been proposed in order to ob-\ntain optodes with response times suitable for use \nin flow systems, and also to avoid the use of the \ninternal bicarbonate solution.\n\nIn the ion-pairing method [6,7,20-24], ion-\npair between a pH indicator and a phase transfer \nsuch as tetraoctylammonium hydroxide is entrap-\nment in a layer of hydrophobic material such as si-\nlicone, permeable to CO2 but not for H\n\n+ [25]. The-\nse optodes show extremely fast response times, \n\nwhen applied in gas phase measurements, but in \nliquid phase the sensor should be covered with a \npermeable membrane for the continuous and pro-\nlonged use [2].\n\nOther configurations including the \ndevelopment of films sensors for CO2  \n[26-29]; coupled the fibre optic in flow cell contai-\nning the indicator in solution [30] and copolyme-\nrised the dye in polymeric matrices [31]; or still \nimmobilising polysiloxane directly on the glass \noptical fibre [32]. \n\nPreviously, we report [33,34] optodes for \npH measurements, constructed immobilised che-\nmically acid\u2013base indicators in a bifurcated boro-\nsilicate optical fibre bundle using the silanisation \nprocedure in organic media. These optodes were \nevaluated in several flow systems showed respon-\nse times and lifetime satisfactory for its use in \nthese systems [33], and evaluated in the indirect \ndetermination of oxalate in food samples, which \nthe CO2 generated by the enzymatic reaction be-\ntween oxalic acid and oxalate oxidase [34], was \nsatisfactorily monitored.\n\nDespite of the numerous optodes reported \nin literature, still exist the necessity to developed \nnew experimental procedures for CO2 determina-\ntion. In this sense, this work describe the results \nobtained in the evaluation of the performance of a \npH optode based on thymol blue (TB) acid-based \ndye, chemically immobilised on the glass optical \nfibre through silanisation, in the indirect determi-\nnation of CO2, as an alternative to the other exis-\nting methods.\n\n2 - experimental\n\n2.1 - reagents and Solutions\n\nAll chemical reagents were of analytical \ngrade. Buffer solutions were prepared using dis-\ntilled water and the actual pH of the solutions was \ndetermined by employing a pH electrode connec-\nted to a pH-meter (Micronal B374).\n\n\n\nEcl. Qu\u00edm., S\u00e3o Paulo, 35 - 2: 33 - 43, 2010 35\n\nArtigo\nArticle\n\nFor the construction of the pH optode, nitric \nacid (Merk), ethanol (Nuclear), o-Xylene (Mallin-\nckrodt), 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (Aldrich) \nand thymol blue (Synth), were used. o-Xylene \nwas previously dried overnight with anhydrous \nNa2SO4 before using in the silanisation.\n\n2.2 - Construction of tb optode\n\nThe optode was constructed as previous-\nly described [33,34], by employing a bifurcated \nborosilicate optical fibre bundle (5 mm diameter), \nmade with fibres of 70 \u00b5m i.d. The surface of the \ncommon end of the optical fibre bundle was ini-\ntially treated with ethanol, nitric acid and ethanol, \nand allowed to dry at room temperature. Then, \nthe silanisation was carried out by introducing \nthe common end of the bundle into a 5.0 % (v/v) \n3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane in o-xylene. After \nthis step, the silanised common end was rinsed \nwith o-xylene, in order to eliminate any excess \nof silane, then with ethanol, to clean off the sol-\nvent, and allowed to dry at room temperature. The \nimmobilisation of the dye was done by introdu-\ncing the common end of the bundle into a 0.04 \n% (w/v) TB solution, containing 8.6 x 10-4 mol l-1 \nNaOH, and rinsed with deionised water. After all \nthis steps the tip of the optical fibers showed an \nintense purple colour, indicating that the immobi-\nlisation was successful. \n\n2.3 - instrumentation\n\nThe instrumentation employed in this work \nconsisted of a radiometric source (Oriel 6883), \nwith a quartz-halogen lamp (12 V, 100 W), whose \nradiation was modulated at 200 \u00b1 2 Hz by means of \nan optical chopper (Oriel 75152) and focused onto \none arm of the optical fibre bundle. The modula-\nted light source was guided to the common end of \nthe optical fibre, where the TB was immobilised. \nThe reflected radiation was focused onto the en-\ntrance slit of a monochromator (Oriel 77250) and \ndetected by a photomultiplier tube (Oriel 77340), \nconnected to a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Resear-\n\nch System SR 510), provided with a pre-amplifier \n(Stanford Reasearch System SR 552). The lock-in \namplifier was synchronised to the frequency of the \noptical chopper. A PC-AT 486 microcomputer was \nemployed to control the monochromator and the \nlock-in amplifier, through an electronic interface \n(ADLink ACL-811). Software was written in Mi-\ncrosoft VisualBasic 3.0 to perform these tasks.\n\n2.4 - flow manifold and procedure\n\nThe flow manifold was assembled as sho-\nwn in Figure 1. Was employing a peristaltic pump \n(Ismatec? IPC8), furnished with tygon tubes to \npropel the solutions. In the FIA system, hydrogen \ncarbonate or carbonate samples were injected into \na 0.1 mol l-1 phosphate buffer at pH 7.6 stream \n(PBS), using a sliding central bar sampling val-\nve  [35], and then were mixed with a phosphoric \nacid solution, in order to generate CO2. The CO2 \ndiffused through a PTFE (Black Swam MFG. Co.) \nmembrane placed in the gas diffusion cell \u201c2\u201d \n[36], and was collected by an adequate acceptor \nfluid, which was continuously pumped towards to \ndetection system \u201cD\u201d, that include the TB opto-\nde. The change of the pH in the acceptor fluid, \ncauses a colour change of the TB immobilised on \nthe optical fibre bundle, generating a variation in \nthe reflectance intensity, which was proportional \nto sample concentration.\n\n\n\nEcl.

It is a \ngood result, because generally, optodes based on \nacid-base dyes presented a response range of two \npH units or pKa \u00b1 1. This peculiar profile of the \nTB optode can be probably explained considering \nthe TB dye characteristics, which presents two-pH \nrange of colour change in aqueous solutions.

Thus, was carry out a study on different acceptor fluids. Solutions of \ndifferent compositions were employed with pH values in the range from 4.0 to 11.0, considering the \ncolor changes of the TB optode. The results obtained with acceptor solutions with pH lower than 5.0 \nwere not reproducible, due to the formation of small bubbles of CO2. For 1.0 x 10\n\n-3 mol l-1 phosphate \nbuffer solution (pH 7.5) provided the best results for CO2 determination in the FIA system, were ob-\ntained (Table 1).

When hydrogen carbonate or carbonate samples, are \ninjected the pH of the accepter fluid changes. These pH changes are detected by TB optode, which res-\nponds linearly until the concentration of the sample causes a pH change in the acceptor fluid of 6.6 (see \nFigure 2). In the proposed FIA system, the injection of samples with concentrations higher than 0.015 \nmol l-1, causes a pH shift in the acceptor fluid for values smaller than 6.6 (Figure 2), corresponding to the \nstraight line with minor inclination of Figure 5. For concentrations higher than 0.015 mol l-1, a straight \nline from 0.020 to 0.10 mol l-1 is obtained.\n\nThe repeatability of the FIA system was evaluated by ten successive injections of 5.0 x 10\u20132 mol \nl-1 sodium carbonate solutions, obtained a relative standard deviation value (R.S.D.) of 3.5%. This result \nindicates the good performance of the proposed FIA system.\n\nThe TB optode lifetime in flow conditions was c.a. of 17 days, which is in accordance with others \noptodes, previously reported [33,34].\n\n\n\nEcl.

O indicador foi quimicamente imobilizado na superf\u00edcie de um feixe bifurcado \nde fibras \u00f3pticas de vidro, usando silaniza\u00e7\u00e3o em meio org\u00e2nico. No sistema FIA, amostras de carbo-\nnato ou bicarbonato s\u00e3o injetadas em uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o tamp\u00e3o carregadora, e a seguir s\u00e3o misturadas com \nsolu\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1cido fosf\u00f3rico para gerar CO2, o qual se difunde atrav\u00e9s de uma membrana de PTFE, para \nser coletado em um fluido carregador aceptor, o qual \u00e9 bombeado em dire\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 cela de detec\u00e7\u00e3o, na qual \nencontra-se o optodo. O sistema proposto apresenta duas faixas lineares de resposta, entre 1,0 x 10-3 e \n1,0 x 10-2 mol l-1, e entre 2,0 x 10-2 e 0,10 mol l-1. A freq\u00fc\u00eancia de amostragem foi de 11 amostras h-1, \ncom boa repetibilidade (R.S.D &lt;4 %, n = 10). Sob condi\u00e7\u00f5es em fluxo o tempo de vida do optodo foi de \n170 h.
