Braz. J. Vet. Parasitol.2\n\nIntroduction\n\nCanine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is a zoonotic disease \nendemic in various countries. In Brazil, visceral leishmaniasis is \ncaused by the protozoa Leishmania infantum. The dog is considered \nan important urban reservoir and the detection of canine cases \nmay precede the occurrence of human visceral leishmaniasis \n(BELO\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2013). The current public health policy in Brazil \ndemands the culling of infected dogs -based on serologic tests - for \nVL control (BRASIL, 2006). Cross-reactivity using Leishmania \ninfantum antigen with sera from Leishmania braziliensis-infected \ndogs is commonly observed (BRASIL, 2006), but dog culling, in \nthis case, is not recommended. Dogs infected with L. braziliensis \ncommonly present localized skin lesions without systemic \ndissemination (MADEIRA\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2005). The urban reservoir of \nL. braziliensis is still not known in Brazil.\n\nCanine hepatozoonosis is a systemic disease caused by \nApicomplexa protozoa of the genus Hepatozoon, that is transmitted \nby ingestion of infected ticks belonging to the genus Rhipicephalus \n(RUBINI\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2008; KAUR\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2012; MIRANDA\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., \n2014). Domestic dogs can be infected by two species: H. canis \nand H. americanum (O\u2019DWYER, 2011). The infected animals \nusually present low parasitemia (MUNDIM\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2008). \nClinically, Hepatozoon infected-animals can present anorexia, lack \nof appetite, fever, pale mucosa, lethargy, diarrhea and vomiting \n(CHHABRA\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2013). Hematological alterations, such as \nanemia, leucocytosis and neutrophilia or lymphopenia, have also \nbeen observed (KAUR\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2012). Many of these clinical signs \ndescribed for canine hepatozoonosis are also observed in CVL.\n\nIn Brazil, Hepatozoon has been observed since 1979, when \nMassard studied the infection (O\u2019DWYER, 2011). Molecular \ncharacterization indicated that Brazilian H. canis was closely \nrelated to isolates from Japan, presented 99% nucleotide identity \nwith isolates from Israel and was found to be distantly related to \nH.\u00a0americanum (RUBINI\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2005). In the following years, canine \nhepatozoonosis has also been described in several Brazilian regions \n(RUBINI\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2008; MIRANDA\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014; GON\u00c7ALVES\u00a0et\u00a0al., \n2014; RAMOS\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2015; DEMONER\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2016). Many of \nthese areas are also endemic for CVL, and co-infection has already \nbeen described in dogs from Rio Grande do Norte based only \non molecular analyses (GON\u00c7ALVES\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014). Herein, we \ndescribed the occurrence of co-infection of dogs with H. canis and \nL. infantum or L. braziliensis, using molecular and histopathological \nanalyses. In addition, the co-infection of H.\u00a0canis and L. braziliensis \ncould have lead to visceral dissemination, which may lead to a \nfalse CVL diagnosis.\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nAnimals and samples\n\nFour seropositive dogs (IFAT - Bio-Manguinhos and ELISA \n- Bio-Manguinhos) for Leishmania, two from Barra do Gar\u00e7as \n(Latitude: 15\u00b0 53\u2019 24\u201d S; Longitude: 52\u00b0 15\u2019 24\u201d W) and two \nfrom Cuiab\u00e1 (Latitude: 15\u00b0 35\u2019 46\u201d S; Longitude: 56\u00b0 05\u2019 48\u201d W), \nMato Grosso state, were included in this study. Clinical evaluations \n\nwere performed before euthanasia and were performed by \nveterinarians at the Zoonosis Control Center (Centro de Controle \nde Zoonoses - CCZ). The procedure included the administration \nof 1.0 ml/Kg of 1.0% Thiopental intravenously (Thiopentax?, \nCrist\u00e1lia) for anesthesia. Once the absence of corneal reflex due \nto deep anesthesia was confirmed, 10 mL of 19.1% potassium \nchloride (Isofarma) was intravenously administered. During \nnecropsy, fragments from spleen and liver were collected for \nhistopathological analysis and molecular techniques. Samples were \nalso forwarded to the Leishmania Collection of the Oswaldo Cruz \nInstitute (CLIOC, www.clioc.fiocruz.br) for parasite isolation and \ntyping. In addition, serum samples were collected and tested with \nthe rapid Dual Path Platform test (DPP CVL, BioManguinhos, \nFIOCRUZ), which detects anti-rK26/39 Leishmania antibodies \n(GRIMALDI\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2012).\n\nEthics statement\n\nThe animals included in this study were naturally infected \nand destined to euthanasia as recommended by the politics of \nBrazilian Ministry of Health. All procedures performed in the \npresent study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the \ninstitution or practice. The present research uses tissues fragments \nafter euthanasia, so the study did not need to be submitted for \nThe Ethics Committee on Animal Use (CEUA) according to \nBrazilian\u2019s Law 11794/08.\n\nLeishmania spp. isolation\n\nSpleen samples were cultured in tubes with biphasic medium \ncontaining Schneider liquid medium for Drosophyla (Sigma) \nwith 10-20% fetal bovine serum and NNN medium as solid \nphase. The\u00a0tubes were maintained at 25 \u00b0C in Biological Oxygen \nDemand (B.O.D.) incubator (Contemp). The cultures were \nevaluated every 5 days for promastigotes growth and maintained \nat least for 4 weeks.\n\nDNA extraction\n\nTotal DNA was isolated from approximately 10 mg of both \nspleen and liver samples using QIAmp? DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, \nCA, USA), which included a prior phase of digestion with 20 ?l \nof proteinase K (20 mg/mL) for 1 h at 56 \u00b0C. DNA was dissolved \nin 50 ?l of Tris EDTA buffer (AE buffer) and quantified via \nNanoDrop? (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).\n\nMolecular detection of Leishmania spp.\n\nThe molecular detection of Leishmania spp. by PCR targeting \nthe ITS1 intergenic region was employed (GRA\u00c7A\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., \n2012). Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) was \nperformed for Leishmania species identification. The ITS1 PCR \nproduct was submitted to digestion using Sau 3AI and loaded on \n12.5% polyacrylamide gel (Genephor). Two Leishmania reference \nstrains were used as controls: IOC/L 579 (Li - Leishmania (L.) \n\n\n\n   3Hepatozoon canis and Leishmania spp. coinfection\n\ninfantum- MHOM/BR/1974/PP75) and IOC/L 566 (Lb - Leishmania \n(V.) braziliensis- MHOM/BR/1975/M2903).\n\nDetermination of Leishmania spp. burden by \nquantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)\n\nLeishmania parasite burden in spleen samples was estimated \nby quantitative real-time PCR (Step One equipment, Applied \nBiosystems, Molecular Probes, Inc.) using the detection system \nPower Sybr Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Molecular \nProbes, Inc.). Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase \n(HPRT) primers were chosen to normalize the concentrations of \ncanine DNA in each sample; the primers described by Prina et al \n(PRINA\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2007) were used to amplify a product corresponding \nto the small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssrRNA), a multi-copy \ngene of Leishmania spp. parasites. DNA (100 ng in 2 ?l) was \nadded to a final PCR reaction volume of 20 ?l containing Power \nSybr Green 1X, 300 nM of each primer for HPRT and 500 nM \nfor ssrRNA PCR assays. Reactions were submitted to a initial \ndenaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of \ndenaturation, annealing and extension (95 \u00b0C for 15 seconds, \n60\u00b0C for 1 minute and 68 \u00b0C for 30 seconds) with the option \nfor a melt curve ranging from 60 \u00b0C to 95 \u00b0C and an incremental \ntemperature of 0.3 \u00b0C for second and a Tm 78 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C. Reactions \nwere performed in duplicate and both targets were run within \nthe same plate for the same sample.\n\nThe number of cells from peripheral blood mononuclear \ncells (PBMC) of non-infected dogs and cultures of L. infantum \npromastigotes (MCAN/BR/2007/CG-1) were determined \nby a cell counter (Z1\u2122 COULTER COUNTER?, Beckman \nCoulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). The total DNA was isolated from \n1.0 \u00d7 106 PBMC cells and 1.0 \u00d7 107promastigotes. Standard \ncurves for the HPRT (R2=0.966, slope= \u20132.98, efficiency=1.13, \ny-intercepto=34.143) and ssrRNA genes (R2=0.943, slope= \u20132.67, \nefficiency=1.18, y-intercepto=28.117) were prepared using serial \n10-fold dilutions from 10\u20132 to 107 of total purified DNA. All \nreactions were performed in duplicate in microtubes (Applied \nBiosystems). The parameters were according with MIQE guidelines \n(BUSTIN\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2009).\n\nMolecular detection of H. canis\n\nH. canis was detected by PCR based on the amplification \nof a fragment of 666 pb of 18S rDNA gene, using HepF \n\n(5\u2019 \u2013 ATA-CAT-GAG-CAA-AAT-CTC-AAC- 3\u2019) and HepR \n(5\u2019 \u2013 CTT-ATT-ATT-CCA-TGC-TGC-AG-3\u2019) primers \n(INOKUMA\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2002) and the GoTaq? DNA Polymerase kit \n(Promega, WI, USA). PCR was performed with a denaturation \nstep at 94 \u00b0C for 3 minutes, followed by 37 cycles of denaturation, \nannealing and extension (94\u00b0C for 45 seconds, 57 \u00b0C for 45\u00a0seconds \nand 72 \u00b0C for 1 minute), and a final extension step (72 \u00b0C for \n7 minutes).\n\nPCR products were purified using ExoSAP? IT (GE Healthcare) \naccordingly to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations and sequenced \nusing the BigDye v.3.1 Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready \nReaction Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in an \nautomated Applied Biosystems ABI 3500 DNA genetic analyzer \n(Applied Biosystems). All sequences obtained were analyzed in \nthe software package Phred/Phrap/Consed Version: 0.020425.c \n(University of  Washington, Seattle, WA, USA) and presented Phred \nvalues above 20 Sequences were edited using BioEdit software, \nversion 7.2.5 (HALL, 1999) and compared for similarity using \nBLAST to the sequences available in GenBank (NCBI, 2016).\n\nPhylogenetic analysis were based on the sequences obtained \nin the study and sequences retrieved in from GenBank. Multiple \nalignment analysis was performed using the Clustal X version 2.0 \n(LARKIN\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2007), and aphylogenetic tree was constructed based \non the Neighbor-Joining algorithm andthe Kimura 2-parameter \nmodel for generating the distance matrix. As implemented in \nMolecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) version \n6 (TAMURA\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2013) Bootstrap of 1000 replicates were \nperformed to estimate the confidence of the branching patterns \n(FELSENSTEIN, 1985). Histopathology\n\nSpleen and liver fragments were fixed in 10% buffered formalin \nfor one to four weeks, embedded in paraffin and sliced in 5-?m \nthick sections to be mounted on microscope slides. The sections \nwere stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and examined by \nlight microscopy (Nikon Eclipse E400 \u2013 Tokyo, Japan). Structural \nchanges of spleen lymphoid tissue, the cell population in the red \npulp and the parasite burden were analyzed.\n\nResults\n\nThe sampled dogs presented different clinical signs and \nLeishmania spp. parasite burdens, but all four were co-infected \nwith Leishmania spp. and Hepatozoon spp. Each case is presented \nseparately and differential diagnosis is summarized in Table\u00a01.\n\nTable 1.

Parasitol.4\n\nDescription of cases\n\nDog 1: A male dog from Cuiab\u00e1, state of Mato Grosso, \npresenting cachexy and ascites. Parasite isolation was positive \nand the species identified as L. infantum in the spleen and liver \n(Figure\u00a01). The\u00a0splenic histopathological analysis showed an organized \nwhite pulp and many mature meronts of H. canis (Figure\u00a02a-e). \nHistological alterations in the liver were not observed. Molecular \nanalysis of Hepatozoon canis was not performed (Table\u00a01).\n\nDog 2: Asymptomatic male dog from Barra do Gar\u00e7as, \nstate of Mato Grosso. Although parasite isolation was negative, \nPCR-RFLP confirmed L. braziliensis infection in spleen and \nliver samples (Figure\u00a0 1). The histopathological analysis of the \nspleen showed an organized white pulp and mature meronts \nof H. canis. The liver presented an intense non-granulomatous \ninflammation, with vacuolar degeneration, intense fibrosis and \ncolestasis. Amastigotes were observed in the liver (Figure\u00a0 2f ). \n= Hepatozoon spp. DNA was only detected in spleen and the \nsequences showed 100% identicalness with H. canis by BLAST \nanalysis (Tables\u00a02,\u00a03, Figure\u00a03).\n\nDog 3: A male dog from Barra do Gar\u00e7as, state of Mato Grosso, \npresenting cachexy, lymphadenomegaly, onychogryphosis and \nconjunctivitis. Parasite isolation was negative; species detection \nwas performed confirming L. braziliensis infection in a spleen \nsample (Figure\u00a0 1). In the liver sample, the digestion of ITS1 \nPCR product generated inconclusive results. Histopathological \nanalysis of the spleen showed intense disorganization of white \npulp, perisplenitis, absence of granuloma and mature meronts \nof Hepatozoon canis. The liver presented intense and diffuse \nnon-granulomatous inflammation, with vacuolar degeneration and \namastigotes. Hepatozoon spp. DNA was detected in the spleen and \nliver and the sequences showed 100% identicalness with H.\u00a0canis \nby BLAST analysis (Tables\u00a02,\u00a03, Figure\u00a03).\n\nDog 4: A female dog from Cuiab\u00e1, state of Mato Grosso, \npresenting alopecia, onychogryphosis, dermatitis and conjunctivitis. \nParasite isolation was negative, though the infection by L.\u00a0infantum \nwas confirmed in the spleen and liver (Figure\u00a01) by PCR-RFLP. \nHistopathological analysis of the spleen showed moderate \ndisorganization of the white pulp, amastigotes and mature \nmeronts of H. canis. The liver presented only a moderate and \ndiffuse non-granulomatous inflammation. Molecular detection \nof H. canis was not performed.\n\nFigure 1.

In silico analysis showed \nthat the ssrRNA and 18S rRNA primers used in this work were \nspecific for Leishmania spp. and Hepatozoon spp., respectively (data \nnot shown), and did not generate cross-reaction. We observed \n100% identicalness between our sequences with H. canis from \nCroatia and other regions of Brazil, suggesting either a geographic \nexpansion of this infection or a recent increase in the efficiency \nin detecting these parasites. Recently, canine hepatozoonosis has \nbeen described in several Brazilian regions (RUBINI\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2008; \nMIRANDA\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014; GON\u00c7ALVES\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014; RAMOS\u00a0et\u00a0al., \n2015; DEMONER\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2016). Many of these areas are also \nendemic for CVL and co-infection was indeed described in dogs \nfrom Rio Grande do Norte, but only through molecular analysis \n(GON\u00c7ALVES\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014).\n\nThe pathogenesis of H. canis infection is influenced by \nimmunodeficiency conditions, an immature immune system \nin young pups, or a concurrent infectious agent (BANETH, \n2011). Conditions that impair the immune responses increase \nthe susceptibility to new infection with H. canis or allow existing \ninfections to reactivate. Co-infections with Toxoplasma, Leishmania, \nBabesia or Ehrlichia predispose dogs to clinical illness (BANETH, \n2011). Detection of L. braziliensis parasites DNA in the liver and \nspleen shows the probability of the visceralization of this species \nin dogs presenting comorbidities. Although DNA detection \nmay not show the presence of viable parasites, additional results \n(observation of amastigotes and ELISA and IFAT positivity) \nconfirmed the infection. Currently, L. braziliensis is considered a \ndermotrophic species in the human leishmaniasis disease complex, \nwith isolation and detection of this species in the viscera only in \ncases of immunologically compromised patients (SILVA\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., \n2002; GONTIJO\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2002). In wild and synantropic animals \n(considered potential reservoirs for L. braziliensis), such a distinction \nregarding tissue tropism does not exist (ROQUE\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2010; \nROQUE &amp; JANSEN, 2014), and the parasite may be detected \nin many organs. In dogs, this species has only been detected in \ncutaneous lesions (MADEIRA\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2005; DANTAS-TORRES, \n2007). The visceralization detected herein by L. braziliensis may \nbe a consequence of the impaired immune system of the dogs. \nSuch an immunological deficit may be due to either Hepatozoon \ninfection alone or the increased virulence due to co-infection. These \nhypotheses are difficult to verify, but the first is more likely since \nthe two dogs infected with L. braziliensis showed lower parasite \nburden than the dog infected by L. infantum, and only one was \nsymptomatic. If we consider that there is a relationship between \nclinical signs and parasite burden (TEIXEIRA-NETO\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2010), \nthe clinical signs described in dog #3 must have been related to \nthe infection by Hepatozoon. Visceralization of L. braziliensis \nstrains was previously reported in dogs (OLIVEIRA\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2013). \nAlthough the authors attributed dissemination and tissue tropism \n\nof populations to a distinct genetic profile, they did not mention \nif there were comorbidities in the evaluated dogs.\n\nTherefore, other studies are needed to highlight the potential \ninfluence of the immune response that both infections could have \non each other. The understanding of this co-infection is crucial \nsince the impaired immune response to leishmaniasis may lead \nto an increased severity of the disease and, consequently, to a \nhigh Leishmania parasite burden and dissemination. This may \nbe - at some point - related to the potential of dogs as reservoirs. \nThe visceralization of L. braziliensis, whether related with the \nco-infection with Hepatozoon or not, raises a question about its \nimpact on Leishmania parasite burden and consequently on the \nrole of dogs as a source of infection to vectors.\n\nIn this study, two animals were infected by L. braziliensis \nand, for this reason, were unnecessarily submitted to euthanasia. \nThey\u00a0were DPP negative, which suggests this test may be a good \ntool for the differential diagnosis and euthanasia. Although \ncross-reaction could be observed by ELISA based on DPP antigens \nwith sera from dogs infected with Leishmania braziliensis, this \ncross-reaction is less frequent than that observed when using \ncrude antigens (PORROZZI\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2007). Nevertheless, it is not \nexpected that this cross-reaction occurs in immunochromatographic \ntests. Because only two animals were evaluated in the present \nstudy, this hypothesis must be better verified. In spite of that, \nthe data points out the importance in performing an etiological \ndiagnosis at the species level. Since 2012, DPP? (rK39 antigen, \nBiomanguinhos) has been used as a screening test for CVL \nfollowed by confirmation with an ELISA test to identify animals \nfor euthanasia when they are positive by both methods. However, \nwhen the samples used herein were collected, DPP? had not been \nused as a method to diagnose CVL yet. For these two dogs, clinical \nsigns attributed to Leishmania infection could actually be related \nto Hepatozoon infection, since L. braziliensis species does not lead \nto such clinical profile. Hepatozoon infection could in turn cause \nimmunosuppression leading to the visceralization of Leishmania \nbraziliensis. In this context, the importance of a complementary \ndiagnosis in the veterinary clinical evaluation, either molecular \nor serological, is clear. Additionally, the impact of co-infection \nwith Leishmania spp. and Hepatozoon spp. or other pathogens \n(Ehrlichia canis, Babesia spp., Anaplasma spp., etc.) on clinical \nmanifestations, the immune response and the parasite burden \nneeds to be clarified.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the present work, Hepatozoon canis infection and co-infection \nwith Leishmania braziliensis were identified for the first time in Barra \ndo Gar\u00e7as, Mato Grosso state, Brazil. From this report, the main \npoints were addressed: i) visceral dissemination of L.\u00a0braziliensis \nassociated with systemic signs suggested that this co-infection \ncould have influenced the parasite burden, the parasite spread, \nmorbidity, clinical signs and, possibly, the role of co-infected \ndogs as reservoirs; ii) it is important for veterinarians to promote \na differential diagnosis for co-infected dogs, with an emphasis on \ndefining the involved Leishmania species.\n\n\n\nMorgado, F.N.\u00a0et\u00a0al.
