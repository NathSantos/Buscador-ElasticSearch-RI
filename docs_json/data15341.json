Coorientador: Carlos Ernesto Gon\u00e7alves Reynaud Schaefer \n \n\nNas \u00e1reas mais perif\u00e9ricas da Ant\u00e1rtica, cada vez mais se verifica o aumento de \u00e1reas \n\nlivres de gelo e a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de solos, que merecem ser mais bem estudados para subsidiar \n\na\u00e7\u00f5es de gest\u00e3o e preserva\u00e7\u00e3o. Neste contexto, o presente estudo articula-se dentro de uma \n\nampla rede de coopera\u00e7\u00e3o cient\u00edfica brasileira para a regi\u00e3o Ant\u00e1rtica, com foco especial na \n\n\u00e1rea conhecida como Lions Rump, localizada na Ba\u00eda Rei George, na Antartica Mar\u00edtima. O \n\nobjetivo do trabalho foi caracterizar os processos de forma\u00e7\u00e3o de solos da \u00e1rea, suas \n\nprincipais caracter\u00edsticas f\u00edsicas, qu\u00edmicas, mineral\u00f3gicas e micromorfol\u00f3gicas, o regime \n\nt\u00e9rmico-h\u00eddrico, as forma\u00e7\u00f5es geomorfol\u00f3gicas presentes, finalizando com a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nmapeamento dos solos. Para isto a \u00e1rea foi percorrida e vinte e seis perfis de solos foram \n\ndescritos, amostrados e analisados. Os resultados indicaram que os solos foram formados, \n\nprincipalmente, a partir do intemperismo de rochas bas\u00e1lticas-andes\u00edticas, apresentando a \n\napatita como mineral acess\u00f3rio e elevado background de P. Propriedades qu\u00edmicas do solo, \n\nmineralogia e tipo de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o foram fortemente influenciadas pela dura\u00e7\u00e3o da ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o por \n\npinguins e pela drenagem do solo. As principais forma\u00e7\u00f5es vegetacionais da \u00e1rea foram \n\ndeterminantes para o regime t\u00e9rmico-h\u00eddrico da camada ativa dos solos. Os resultados obtidos \n\npermitiram agrupar os solos de Lions Rump em tr\u00eas grupos, em fun\u00e7\u00e3o da influ\u00eancia \n\nornitog\u00eanica. Os solos ornitog\u00eanicos de pH \u00e1cido predominam nas posi\u00e7\u00f5es da paisagem mais \n\nantigas e est\u00e1veis, onde a ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o das aves foi mais duradoura. Apresentam densa cobertura \n\nvegetal com plantas superiores, baixo pH e satura\u00e7\u00e3o de bases, elevados teores de P, Al+3, \n\ncarbono org\u00e2nico total (COT) e N total. Os solos ornitog\u00eanicos de pH neutro, semelhante aos \n\nanteriores, apresentam altos teores de P e densa cobertura vegetal, entretanto possuem alta \n\nsatura\u00e7\u00e3o de bases e valores de pH pr\u00f3ximos do neutro. Esses est\u00e3o presentes em \u00e1reas \n\nrecentemente ocupadas pela influ\u00eancia ornitog\u00eanica, especialmente nas morainas quatern\u00e1rias \n\n\n\nix \n\n \n\ne terra\u00e7os soerguidos. A principal diferen\u00e7a entre os dois grupos de solos ornitog\u00eanicos foi o \n\ntempo de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 influ\u00eancia das aves e a quantidade de deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de guano. Nesses solos \n\nornitog\u00eanicos, a fosfatiza\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 o principal processo de forma\u00e7\u00e3o do solo, em que os minerais \n\nfosfatados s\u00e3o formados a partir da intera\u00e7\u00e3o do guano com os minerais prim\u00e1rios dos solos. \n\nPor sua vez, os solos n\u00e3o ornitog\u00eanicos apresentam pH b\u00e1sico, elevada satura\u00e7\u00e3o de bases, \n\nbaixo COT e praticamente desprovidos de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o. Os principais solos identificados na \u00e1rea \n\nforam Typic Dystrogelepts ornithic e Typic Gelorthents ornithic, que possivelmente \n\nrepresentam uma das primeiras \u00e1reas livres de gelo colonizados por pinguins na Ant\u00e1rtica \n\nMar\u00edtima. O solo Typic Dystrogelepts ornithic representam os solos mais profundos, mais \n\nestruturados e avermelhados identificados em Lions Rump. Nas posi\u00e7\u00f5es acima de 80 m de \n\naltitude acima do n\u00edvel do mar, especialmente nas \u00e1reas de topo e manchas paraglaciais, \n\ndestacam-se os solos Typic Haploturbels e Lithic Haploturbels, que representam a maior \n\ncobertura de solo na \u00e1rea estudada. Esses fazem parte do grupo dos Gelisols (Cryosols), que \n\ns\u00e3o solos com materiais gelic dentro dos primeiros 100 cm da superf\u00edcie e permafrost dentro \n\ndos 200 cm da superf\u00edcie. Nos solos Typic Haploturbels e Lithic Haploturbels presentes na \n\nborda das geleiras, o permafrost encontra-se nos primeiros 100 cm do solo e os processos de \n\ncrioturba\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o mais expressivos. Entre 40 e 80 m de altitude, aparecem os solos Typic \n\nHaploturbels e Lithic Haploturbels, que n\u00e3o apresentam influ\u00eancia de nidifica\u00e7\u00e3o de aves e \n\nnem permafrost nos primeiros 200 cm do perfil. No primeiro n\u00edvel dos terra\u00e7os e praias, ao \n\nlongo da zona costeira, dominam os solos Vitrandic Cryopsamments e Oxyaquic \n\nCryopsamments. Em \u00e1reas muito limitadas ainda aparecem os solos Cryorthents ornithic, \n\nassociados aos afloramentos de rochas (plugs bas\u00e1lticos) pr\u00f3ximos da praia; e Typic \n\nGelifluvents ornithic, em pequenos leques aluviais glaciares. Os processos de forma\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nsolos saliniza\u00e7\u00e3o e podzoliza\u00e7\u00e3o, bem como fei\u00e7\u00f5es redoxim\u00f3rficas n\u00e3o foram observados. O \n\nmonitoramento da camada ativa e permafrost foram realizados pela instala\u00e7\u00e3o de sensores de \n\numidade e temperatura do solo, e do ar, em dois sitios pr\u00f3ximos, na mesma altitude, mesma \n\nclasse de solo, ambos Cambissolo G\u00e9lico com cobertura vegetal diferenciada. Uma \u00e1rea era \n\ncoberta por campo de musgo (Andrea gainii) situada em um canal de drenagem e a outra \u00e1rea, \n\num pouco mais elevada, coberta por comunidade de liquens dominada por Usnea antarctic \n\nand Ochrolechia frigida. Resultados mostraram que em ambos os s\u00edtios de monitoramento os \n\nsensores n\u00e3o alcan\u00e7aram o permafrost at\u00e9 80 cm, mas devido \u00e0s temperaturas registradas no \n\nver\u00e3o estarem pr\u00f3ximas de zero, provavelmente o permafrost est\u00e1 pr\u00f3ximo dos 100 cm abaixo \n\nda superf\u00edcie. No campo de musgo a varia\u00e7\u00e3o da temperatura foi menor, esta menor amplitude \n\n\n\nx \n\n \n\nest\u00e1 relacionada com o poder tamp\u00e3o da temperatura proporcionado pelo maior conte\u00fado de \n\n\u00e1gua neste s\u00edtio.  \n\n\n\nxi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\n \n\nALMEIDA, Ivan Carlos Carreiro, D.Sc., Universidade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa, agosto de 2012. \nSoil of Lions Rump, Maritime Antarctica: Soil formation process, survey, mapping and \nthermal monitoring of the active layer. Adviser: Raphael Bragan\u00e7a Alves Fernandes. Co-\nadviser: Carlos Ernesto Gon\u00e7alves Reynaud Schaefer \n \n\nIn the peripheral areas of Antarctica, there is an increase in ice-free areas and soil \n\nformation, which deserve further study to support programs to management and \n\npreservation. In this context, the present study is structured within a wide network of \n\nBrazilian scientific cooperation for the Antarctic region, with a special focus in the area \n\nknown as Lions Rump, located in the King George Bay, Maritime Antarctica. The objective \n\nof this study was to evaluate the processes of soil formation in the area, its main physical, \n\nchemical, mineralogical and micromorphological characteristics, the hydrothermal regime, \n\ngeomorphological formations present, ending with the classification and mapping of soils \n\naccording to the WRB and USDA classification systems. Twenty-six soil profiles from \n\nLions Rump (LR), King George Bay, Maritime Antarctica were described, sampled and \n\nanalyzed for their physical, chemical and mineralogical properties, as a result, a soil map \n\nwas made. Results showed that soils in LR are most formed from weathered basalt-andesitic \n\nrocks, having apatite as accessory mineral, with high P background. For this purpose, the \n\narea was covered and twenty-six soil profiles were described, sampled and analyzed. The \n\nresults indicated that soil chemical properties, mineralogy and vegetation type were strongly \n\ninfluenced by the duration of the occupation by penguins and soil drainage. The main \n\nvegetation formations within the area were instrumental in the water-thermal regime of the \n\nactive layer of soil. The results grouped Lions Rump soils into three groups, depending on \n\nthe ornithogenic influence. Acidic pH Ornithogenic soils predominate in the oldest and most \n\nstable of positions the landscape, where the occupation of the birds was longer lasting. They \n\nhave dense vegetation with higher plants, low pH and base saturation, high levels of P, Al3+, \n\ntotal organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen. Neutral pH ornithogenic soils, similar to \n\nprevious ones, have high levels of P and dense vegetation; however, have high base \n\nsaturation and pH close to neutral. These are present in areas recently occupied by the \n\n\n\nxii \n\n \n\nornithogenic influence, especially in the Quaternary moraines and uplifted terraces. The \n\nmain difference between the two groups of ornithogenic soils was the exposure time under \n\nthe influence of the bird and the amount of guano depositions. In ornithogenic soils, \n\nphosphatization is the main process of soil formation, in which the phosphate minerals are \n\nformed from the interaction of guano with the primary minerals of the soil. Non-\n\nornithogenic soils have basic pH, high base saturation, low TOC and almost devoid of \n\nvegetation. Typic Dystrogelepts ornithic and Typic Gelorthents ornithic are the main soils in \n\nLR, which possibly represents one of the first ice-free areas colonized by penguins in \n\nMaritime Antarctica. Typic Dystrogelepts ornithic from LR represent the deepest, most \n\nstructured and reddish soils so far described in the area. Typic Haplogelepts ornithic are the \n\nmain soils on first and second moraine levels from the White Eagle Glacier. Typic \n\nHaplorthels and Lithic Haplorthels are present just above 80 m a.s.l., especially on the top \n\nareas and paraglacial spots, and represent LR Gelisols, with gelic materials within 100 cm of \n\nthe soil surface and permafrost within 200 cm of the soil surface. Despite their occurrence \n\nonly at higher altitudes, they represent the greatest soil cover in the studied area. Turbic \n\nHaplogelepts and Typic Haplorthents are situated between 40 and 80 m a.s.l., without bird \n\nnesting influence and absent of permafrost within 200 cm in the profile. Vitrandic \n\nCryopsamments and Oxyaquic Cryopsamments dominated the first level of terraces and \n\nformer beaches along the coastal area. Other soils classified are present in very limited areas: \n\nLithic Cryorthents ornithic, present on the sea stacks rock outcrops (basaltic plugs) close to \n\nthe beach, and Typic Gelifluvents ornithic represent a small area on glacial alluvial fans. \n\nOverall, the distribution and classification of local soils allowed the separation of two main \n\nsoil domains in LR: (1) Ornithogenic soils (without permafrost) and the Gelisols (above 80 \n\nm a.s.l.). The monitoring of active layer thermal regime at Lions Rump was realized in two \n\nshallow boreholes, geographic closed, at proximally altitude and same soil class but under \n\ndifferent vegetation. The ground temperature series were collected at 1-hour intervals, \n\nrecorded of two years from March 2009 to February 2011. In both boreholes, a network of \n\nthree soil temperatures sensors were installed at 10, 30 and 80 cm depths, one moisture \n\nsensor at 80 cm and one air temperature sensor 100 cm height. The two sites show \n\nsignificant differences of the mean annual ground temperature for all depths. The moss site \n\nshow lower soil temperature amplitude than Usnea site. The soil temperature at Usnea site \n\nfollowed most the variability of air temperate. Moss site show more soil humid throughout \n\nthe years because of his position on the landscape (water track).

Ela exerce influ\u00eancia predominante no clima do \n\nhemisf\u00e9rio sul e na atmosfera global e nos sistemas criosf\u00e9ricos por causa da sua altitude e posi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ngeogr\u00e1fica (Ugolini &amp; Bockheim, 2008). A forma\u00e7\u00e3o de solo na Ant\u00e1rtica est\u00e1 restrita a menos de \n\n0,35% do continente (45.000 km2), abrangendo \u00e1reas livres de gelo, localizadas na costa e nos vales \n\nsecos glaciais entre as montanhas (Campbell e Claridge, 1987, Bockheim, 1997). \n\nNa Ant\u00e1rtica, o intemperismo qu\u00edmico em princ\u00edpio, n\u00e3o \u00e9 suficientemente importante para \n\ncausar grandes mudan\u00e7as na composi\u00e7\u00e3o da massa de rochas e solos (Kelly &amp; Zumberge, 1961, citados \n\npor Lee, 2004). As conclus\u00f5es gerais sobre a forma\u00e7\u00e3o do solo na Ant\u00e1rtica s\u00e3o de que os processos \n\nqu\u00edmicos de intemperismo funcionam apenas de forma muito limitada e que, a desintegra\u00e7\u00e3o da rocha e \n\nforma\u00e7\u00e3o do solo \u00e9 provocada em grande parte por processos f\u00edsicos, embora Simas et al. (2008) tenham \n\nsugerido uma atua\u00e7\u00e3o mais forte de intemperismo qu\u00edmico que o previsto, na Ant\u00e1rtica Mar\u00edtima. A \n\nvegeta\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 restrita a musgos, l\u00edquens e algas devido \u00e0 severidade do ambiente, sendo que plantas \n\nsuperiores n\u00e3o ocorrem devido \u00e0s baixas temperaturas e fortes ventos. No entanto, na \u00e1rea denominada \n\nAnt\u00e1rtica mar\u00edtima, que abrange partes da Pen\u00ednsula Ant\u00e1rtica e as ilhas, o clima \u00e9 mais quente e \n\napresenta mais \u00e1gua no estado liquido, favorecendo o intemperismo qu\u00edmico. Os solos nesta parte da \n\nAnt\u00e1rtica s\u00e3o caracterizados pela maior predomin\u00e2ncia de processos de crioturba\u00e7\u00e3o, como evidenciado \n\npela presen\u00e7a de solos com padr\u00f5es \u201cpatterned ground\u201d (Campbell &amp;Claridge, 1987).  \n\nEstudos realizados por Hall (1997) mostraram que a principal limita\u00e7\u00e3o para a atua\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nintemperismo f\u00edsico associado ao congelamento e descongelamento n\u00e3o \u00e9 a temperatura, mas sim a \n\npresen\u00e7a de \u00e1gua no sistema. Nas \u00e1reas livres de gelo das regi\u00f5es costeiras, a forma\u00e7\u00e3o do solo e a \n\natua\u00e7\u00e3o dos processos de intemperismo qu\u00edmicos ocorrem em maior intensidade do que se pensava \n\nanteriormente (Blume et al., 1997; Beyer et al., 2000). Embora as rea\u00e7\u00f5es sejam presumivelmente lentas \n\nem condi\u00e7\u00f5es ant\u00e1rticas, o intemperismo qu\u00edmico ainda \u00e9 sugerido como o principal processo para a \n\neleva\u00e7\u00e3o dos teores de Mg, Ca e \u00edons carbonatos para a forma\u00e7\u00e3o dos dep\u00f3sitos de sais (Keys &amp; \n\nWilliams, 1981, citados por Lee, 2004). A deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de material org\u00e2nico pelas aves marinhas tamb\u00e9m \n\napresenta importante papel na forma\u00e7\u00e3o de solos nessas \u00e1reas. \n\nComo em outras regi\u00f5es do mundo, o desenvolvimento de solos na Ant\u00e1rtica \u00e9 influenciado pelo \n\n\n\n2 \n \n\nclima, material de origem, topografia e atividade biol\u00f3gica ao longo do tempo. O clima \u00e9 um dos fatores \n\nmais importantes para a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de solos na Ant\u00e1rtica, pois influencia a quantidade de umidade \n\ndispon\u00edvel no perfil, o que ir\u00e1 determinar a g\u00eanese dos solos (Campbell &amp; Claridge, 1987), a presen\u00e7a de \n\npermafrost (French, 2001) e a ocorr\u00eancia e tipo de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o (Ellenberg, 1988). Na Ant\u00e1rtica Mar\u00edtima, \n\no clima tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 o fator mais relevante para o desenvolvimento do solo, uma vez que a combina\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nmaior precipita\u00e7\u00e3o (pode superar 500 mm ano-1) e temperaturas mais altas s\u00e3o mais favor\u00e1veis \u00e0 \n\nexist\u00eancia da vida vegetal, consistindo ainda em local de ac\u00famulo de quantidades significativas de \n\nmat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica no solo. \n\nMudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas no passado influenciaram a vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o com rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s esp\u00e9cies e \n\ncomplexidade das comunidades, exercendo impacto significativo sobre suas caracter\u00edsticas e \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o (Birks, 1991; Wick &amp; Tinner 1997; ambos citados por Cannone, 2006). Mesmo atualmente, \n\nos permafrost t\u00eam demonstrado ser altamente suscet\u00edveis \u00e0s altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas (Osterkamp 2005), \n\nsobretudo quando em distribui\u00e7\u00e3o descont\u00ednua. O clima influencia o permafrost, a espessura da camada \n\nativa, a vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o e as propriedades do solo de forma que estes componentes ambientais interagem via \n\nmecanismos complexos, afetando os processos pedogen\u00e9ticos. \n\nA camada ativa refere-se \u00e0 camada de solo que est\u00e1 sujeita a congelamento e descongelamento \n\nanual. Como regra geral, \u00e9 mais fina nas regi\u00f5es polares (15 cm), sendo mais espessa nas sub-regi\u00f5es da \n\nAnt\u00e1rtica (100 cm ou mais) (French, 2001). A espessura da camada ativa pode variar de ano para ano, \n\ndependendo da temperatura ambiente, grau e orienta\u00e7\u00e3o do declive, vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o, drenagem, cobertura de \n\nneve, o solo e/ou tipo de rocha (French, 2001) e, principalmente, da umidade do perfil (Hall, 1997).  \n\nA profundidade da penetra\u00e7\u00e3o da frente fria no perfil depende principalmente da intensidade do \n\nfrio, de sua dura\u00e7\u00e3o, das propriedades t\u00e9rmicas e f\u00edsicas do solo e rochas, da vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o sobrejacente, da \n\ncobertura de neve (French, 2001) e do teor de \u00e1gua livre no solo.  \n\nOs solos que ocorrem em \u00e1reas livres de gelo na Ant\u00e1rtica continental e s\u00e3o geralmente quase \n\ntotalmente desprovidos de mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica, sendo denominados de \u201cAhumic soils\u201d por Tedrov &amp; \n\nUgolini (1966), citados por Tatur (1989). Quando presente uma cobertura vegetal de musgos e l\u00edquens \n\ns\u00e3o denominados de \u201cProtoranker soils\u201d. A influ\u00eancia da popula\u00e7\u00e3o biol\u00f3gica \u00e9 quase indetect\u00e1vel nos \n\nahumic soils, que apresentam teores de C org\u00e2nico e N extremamente baixos. Em contrapartida, nos \n\nprotoranker soils a influ\u00eancia da vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o pode ser comprovado pelos maiores teores de C e N na parte \n\nsuperior do perfil, alcan\u00e7ando at\u00e9 mais que 7% de C no horizonte org\u00e2nico superficial e, acima de 1,2%, \n\nnas camadas minerais subsuperficiais (Campbell &amp; Claridge, 1987). Em subsuperf\u00edcie, o enriquecimento \n\norg\u00e2nico se d\u00e1, em grande parte, pela presen\u00e7a de ra\u00edzes e outros fragmentos de plantas, e n\u00e3o de \n\nmateriais humificados, sendo que as rela\u00e7\u00f5es C/N variam de 6 a 16. Tendo em vista a presen\u00e7a de \n\nmateriais org\u00e2nicos n\u00e3o decompostos, esses \u00edndices parecem indicar a exist\u00eancia de uma fonte externa \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nde N, possivelmente a partir de organismos fixadores, excrementos de aves ou via absor\u00e7\u00e3o pelas \n\nplantas de nitrato presente nos sais sol\u00faveis na \u00e1gua (Campbell &amp; Claridge, 1987). Na Ant\u00e1rtica \n\nmar\u00edtima, os solos protoranker s\u00e3o mais comuns, abrangendo grande por\u00e7\u00e3o do ambiente, em especial \n\nna cobertura das morainas, onde a superf\u00edcie \u00e9 mais est\u00e1vel (Campbell &amp; Claridge, 1987).  \n\nCom rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o presente na Ant\u00e1rtica Mar\u00edtima, Holdgate et al. (1967) verificaram \n\nquatro principais tipos na Ilha Signy, que s\u00e3o ainda considerados como representativo desta regi\u00e3o com \n\nvaria\u00e7\u00f5es de esp\u00e9cies nas diferentes \u00e1reas: \n\n1) associa\u00e7\u00e3o de l\u00edquens e musgos, dominada por Usnea, Himantormia e esp\u00e9cies de Andreaea \n\npresentes nas \u00e1reas expostas de solos rochosos, \n\n2) associa\u00e7\u00e3o de musgo (turf-moss), dominada por Dicranum aciphyllum e Polytrichum strictum, \n\ncom incrusta\u00e7\u00f5es locais de liquens, nas vertentes de inclina\u00e7\u00e3o moderada a \u00edngremes, bem drenadas e \n\nensolaradas, \n\n3) associa\u00e7\u00e3o de \u201ctapetes\u201d de musgos, dominada por Brachythecium, Acrocladium, Pohlia e \n\nDrepandocladus spp, encontrados em \u00e1reas mal drenadas, \n\n4) comunidades de plantas vasculares, dominadas por Deschampsia antarctica e Colobanthus \n\nquitensis, em \u00e1reas bem drenadas e ensolaradas.  \n\nDevido \u00e0 aus\u00eancia de organismo revolvedores de solo, como as minhocas, os organismos \n\npresentes como col\u00eambolas, \u00e1caros, nematoides, bact\u00e9rias, protozo\u00e1rios e fungos est\u00e3o em grande parte \n\nconfinados \u00e0 camada org\u00e2nica desfavorecendo a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de h\u00famus e m\u00ednima incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o de mat\u00e9ria \n\norg\u00e2nica no solo (Campbell &amp; Claridge, 1987). Por outro lado, Michel et al. (2006) verificaram a \n\nforma\u00e7\u00e3o de subst\u00e2ncias h\u00famicas est\u00e1veis em solos ornitog\u00eanicos na ba\u00eda do Almirantado. \n\nA concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de nutrientes na maioria das comunidades vegetais (Albuquerque-Filho, 2005) \n\nsugere que h\u00e1 pouca limita\u00e7\u00e3o de nutrientes para o crescimento, apesar de o N poder ser o limitante em \n\nalguns casos. A principal limita\u00e7\u00e3o para o crescimento das plantas parece ser a instabilidade da \n\nsuperf\u00edcie do solo, causada em grande parte pelos processos de crioturba\u00e7\u00e3o que impedem o \n\nestabelecimento das plantas. Quando as superf\u00edcies s\u00e3o est\u00e1veis, as plantas de melhor adapta\u00e7\u00e3o ao \n\nregime clim\u00e1tico vigente s\u00e3o favorecidas e, com elas, a microfauna e microflora associada. \n\nA ocorr\u00eancia de avifauna favorece a biodiversidade e a disponibilidade de nutrientes em alguns \n\nlocais, proporcionando a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de solos ornitog\u00eanicos (Ugolini 1970; Ugolini 1972; Tatur, 1989; \n\nTatur et al., 1997). Em ecossistemas terrestres da Ant\u00e1rtica Mar\u00edtima (Ilha Rei George), a transfer\u00eancia \n\nda produ\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria marinha para a terra promovidas por pinguins (Pygoscelis sp.) e outras aves \n\nacentuam os processos de forma\u00e7\u00e3o do solo, catalisando o intemperismo qu\u00edmico. \n\nCom o degelo e conseq\u00fcente eleva\u00e7\u00e3o glacio-isost\u00e1tica durante o Holoceno, um grande n\u00famero \n\nde pinguineiras foram abandonadas e novas se desenvolveram nos terra\u00e7os recentemente expostos mais \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\npr\u00f3ximos da costa emergente e em afloramentos rochosos (Tatur et al., 1996). Na sequ\u00eancia, esses s\u00edtios \n\nabandonados foram cobertos pela vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o e sujeitos aos processos pedogen\u00e9ticos. Nessas \u00e1reas de ex-\n\ncol\u00f4nias da avifauna evoluiu um determinado tipo de solo criog\u00eanico, provisoriamente classificado \n\ncomo Criossolos Ornitog\u00eanicos, com base em atributos f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicos peculiares relacionados \u00e0 \n\nacumula\u00e7\u00e3o de excrementos de aves e de transforma\u00e7\u00e3o desses s\u00edtios em lugares de nidifica\u00e7\u00e3o ao longo \n\nda costa ant\u00e1rtica (Tatur, 1997). Estes solos s\u00e3o geralmente caracterizadas por baixo valores de pH, \n\nteores elevados de P, alta disponibilidade de Al3+, e vari\u00e1vel, mas geralmente elevada quantidade de \n\nCa2+, Mg2+ e K+  troc\u00e1veis (Schaefer et al., 2004; Michel et al., 2006; Simas et al., 2007). \n\nEm \u00e1reas de ex-col\u00f4nias de ping\u00fcins, Michel et al. (2006) verificaram a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de solos com \n\nclaras caracter\u00edsticas ornitog\u00eanicas. Nesses solos, o P \u00e9 encontrado em teores pr\u00f3ximos aos verificados \n\nnas atuais col\u00f4nias (562-1.119 mg dm-3), e a satura\u00e7\u00e3o de Al3+ \u00e9 elevada e incrementada em \n\nprofundidade em todos os perfis com caracter\u00edsticas esp\u00f3dicas, o que indica que a mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica pode \n\nestar associada com a transforma\u00e7\u00e3o e movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o vertical de Al3+. A distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\nmicroelementos \u00e9 bastante irregular nestes solos, com teores mais elevados de Mn e Cu em \u00e1reas mais \n\nest\u00e1veis e de maior potencial redox e, teores de Zn consideravelmente elevados em locais fortemente \n\nafetados pela ornitog\u00eanese, dada sua estreita rela\u00e7\u00e3o com organismos marinhos (Santos et al., 2005). A \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o de Fe \u00e9 regular em profundidade para todos os perfis, com valores ligeiramente superiores \n\npara os s\u00edtios ornitog\u00eanicos. Grandes \u00e1reas de col\u00f4nias abandonadas por pinguins e ninhos de skua \n\n(Catharacta spp.) tamb\u00e9m apresentam solos f\u00f3sseis com claras caracter\u00edsticas ornitog\u00eanicas, como \n\nseixos de nidifica\u00e7\u00e3o e espessa camada org\u00e2nica sobrejacente (Schaefer et al., 2004).  \n\nAs pinguineiras ativas s\u00e3o totalmente desprovidas de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o devido aos efeitos t\u00f3xicos \n\nprovocados pelo excesso de excrementos e pelo pisoteio dos pinguins (Tatur et al., 1996). Por outro \n\nlado, solos ornitog\u00eanicos das paleopinguineiras e s\u00edtios marginais com moderada \u00e0 alta abund\u00e2ncia de \n\nnutrientes apresentam vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o densa e mais diversificada (Tatur, 1989). \n\nV\u00e1rios estudos realizados na Ant\u00e1rtica Mar\u00edtima provaram que materiais lixiviados a partir do \n\nguano reagem fortemente com o substrato subsuperficial, formando uma camada de material fosfatizado \n\nque pode ser subdividida em horizontes gen\u00e9ticos de diferente composi\u00e7\u00e3o mineral (Tatur &amp; Barczuc, \n\n1983; Tatur &amp; Myrcha, 1993a). Este processo especial de forma\u00e7\u00e3o do solo, denominado fosfatiza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\n(Schaefer et al., 2004; Simas et al., 2008 e Schaefer et al., 2008), \u00e9 poss\u00edvel devido \u00e0 intensa entrada de \n\nmaterial org\u00e2nico rico em P durante o ver\u00e3o. Tatur &amp; Myrcha (1993b) estimaram essa contribui\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nexcrementos das aves como equivalente a aproximadamente 10 kg m-2 (peso seco) por ano. Nesses \n\ns\u00edtios, ap\u00f3s o abandono das aves, um o\u00e1sis de vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o se desenvolve, com maior atividade biol\u00f3gica, \n\ntemperatura mais alta e uma camada ativa mais espessa (Myrcha et al., 1983). \n\nApesar da limitada distribui\u00e7\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica, os solos ornitog\u00eanicos s\u00e3o os mais desenvolvidos e \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nos mais importantes reservat\u00f3rios de C org\u00e2nico (Simas et al., 2007) na Ant\u00e1rtida terrestre. A \n\ncompreens\u00e3o dos fen\u00f4menos f\u00edsicos e qu\u00edmicos, da din\u00e2mica da mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica e dos ciclos \n\nbiogeoqu\u00edmicos nas \u00e1reas polares apresenta especial relev\u00e2ncia para a preserva\u00e7\u00e3o desses ambientes e \n\npara um melhor entendimento da pedog\u00eanese em ambientes de extremo frio (Michel et al., 2006). \n\nEm estudo da g\u00eanese dos solos da ba\u00eda do Almirantado, na Ant\u00e1rtica Mar\u00edtima, Simas et al. \n\n(2007) descreveram e analisaram 56 perfis e verificaram que a g\u00eanese nesses solos fracamente \n\ndesenvolvidos, exceto nos ornitog\u00eanicos, \u00e9 muito influenciada pela litologia do material de origem. Os \n\nautores ent\u00e3o proporam a divis\u00e3o desses solos em quatros grupos principais: 1) basalticos/andesiticos, 2) \n\nsulfatados \u00e1cidos, 3) fracamente ornitog\u00eanicos e 4) ornitog\u00eanicos. Os eutric Lithic and Typic \n\nHaploturbels (Turbic-leptic Cryosols), de rea\u00e7\u00f5es neutras a alcalinas s\u00e3o solos predominantes nos \n\ndep\u00f3sitos bas\u00e1lticos/andes\u00edticos. Os \u00e1cidos dystric Sulfuric Haploturbels (Turbic-thionic Cryosols) est\u00e3o \n\nlimitados aos materiais andes\u00edticos piritizados e os Umbriturbels (Turbic-umbric Cryosols) s\u00e3o os \n\nformados devido \u00e0 influ\u00eancia da avifauna. Os solos ornitog\u00eanicos s\u00e3o os formados pela presen\u00e7a no \n\npassado ou atual de pinguineiras ativas. Os Organo Fibristels s\u00e3o encontrados em locais mal drenados e \n\nsob espessa camada de tapetes de musgos. Trabalhos como o desses autores s\u00e3o interessantes, pois \n\npermitem contribuir com poss\u00edveis modifica\u00e7\u00f5es nos sistemas de classifica\u00e7\u00e3o de solos existentes para \n\nque possam, no futuro, enquadrar os solos da Ant\u00e1rtica Mar\u00edtima.  \n\nAs regi\u00f5es polares s\u00e3o consideradas como sistemas muito sens\u00edveis param se estudar os impactos \n\ndo clima, pois seus componentes abi\u00f3ticos (Weller 1998) e bi\u00f3ticos (Hodkinson et al., 1998) s\u00e3o \n\naltamente suscet\u00edveis a perturba\u00e7\u00f5es. As zonas polares de ambos os hemisf\u00e9rios t\u00eam sido muito \n\nreferenciadas como regi\u00f5es-chave para a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o e monitoramento dos impactos das altera\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nclim\u00e1ticas. Mudan\u00e7as mais evidentes e mais r\u00e1pidas s\u00e3o esperadas nas \u00e1reas polares e as primeiras \n\nprovas foram relatadas no \u00c1rtico e na Pen\u00ednsula Ant\u00e1rtica (Convey, 2001; Cook et al., 2005; Turner et \n\nal., 2005). A influ\u00eancia do clima sobre o permafrost \u00e9 expressa pela combina\u00e7\u00e3o do balan\u00e7o energ\u00e9tico \n\nna superf\u00edcie e o balan\u00e7o t\u00e9rmico, ou seja, respectivamente associado \u00e0 temperatura da superf\u00edcie do \n\nsolo (GST) e \u00e0 temperatura do permafrost devido ao aporte energ\u00e9tico da GST. O balan\u00e7o energ\u00e9tico da \n\nsuperf\u00edcie \u00e9 influenciado por fatores como vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o e cobertura de neve, ambas agindo como uma \n\ncamada de tamponamento entre a atmosfera e o solo (Williams &amp; Smith 1989). A cobertura do solo e, \n\nsobretudo, as mudan\u00e7as na vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e3o entre os fatores mais importantes capazes de modificar a \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o do permafrost e seu regime t\u00e9rmico. Monitorar tais efeitos e associ\u00e1-los \u00e0s mudan\u00e7as \n\nclim\u00e1ticas globais \u00e9 um grande desafio aos ped\u00f3logos, que agora exploram com mais intensidade a \n\nAnt\u00e1rtica Mar\u00edtima. \n\nDevido \u00e0 sensibilidade do ambiente ant\u00e1rtico as varia\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas, a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\ncomportamento do degelo dos permafrost \u00e9 de grande valia para elucidar os poss\u00edveis impactos que o \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\naquecimento global pode trazer ao planeta. Isso porque a camada de gelo que cobre o solo, al\u00e9m de atuar \n\ncomo isolante t\u00e9rmico, favorecendo a perman\u00eancia dos permafrost, favorece tamb\u00e9m a reflex\u00e3o da \n\nirradia\u00e7\u00e3o solar contribuindo para exist\u00eancia dos permafrost durante todo o ano. Com avan\u00e7o atual do \n\ndegelo em \u00e1reas que antes estavam continuamente congeladas, a tend\u00eancia \u00e9 que cada ano mais \u00e1rea seja \n\ndescoberta, pois o solo desnudo de gelo tem maior capacidade de absor\u00e7\u00e3o da intensidade luminosa, \n\nal\u00e9m de favorecer a coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o por esp\u00e9cies vegetais, que concomitantemente levam ao aumento da \n\ntemperatura desses solos, agravando o degelo dos permafrost e ativando os processos pedogen\u00e9ticos. \n\nAssim \u00e9 de grande valia e import\u00e2ncia elucidar quais os fatores atmosf\u00e9ricos e do solo \n\n(mineralogia, estrutura, textura, umidade, atividade biol\u00f3gica) que ditam a temperatura e o controle \n\ndesses permafrost. \n\nSolos posicionados em vertentes que recebem menor irradia\u00e7\u00e3o solar apresentam-se menos \n\nintemperizados e menos profundos, em fun\u00e7\u00e3o da menor quantidade de energia luminosa incidente, \n\nresultando em um ambiente mais frio e seco. Esses fatores desfavorecem tamb\u00e9m a ornitog\u00eanese, muito \n\nimportante para a pedog\u00eanese nas \u00e1reas mais \u00famidas.  \n\nDe acordo com o supracitado o presente trabalho foi dividido em tr\u00eas cap\u00edtulos, os quais tiveram \n\ncomo objetivos: \n\n? Fazer o levantamento e mapeamento dos solos de Lions Rump, caracterizando os atribudos qu\u00edmicos, \nf\u00edsicos e mineral\u00f3gicos da \u00e1rea e suas rela\u00e7\u00f5es com a geomorfologia e cobertura vegetal e \n\nCorrelacionar caracter\u00edsticas de solos, vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o e dos processos paraglaciais e periglaciais e \n\ncomparar solos ornitog\u00eanicos da \u00e1rea de estudo com os de outras \u00e1reas da Ant\u00e1rtica Mar\u00edtima \n\ne Peninsular.  \n\n? Estudar a fra\u00e7\u00e3o argila dos solos de Lions Rump analizando e descrevendo as mais importantes \nfei\u00e7\u00f5es micromorfologicas t\u00edpicas em solos criog\u00eanicos, principalmente dos ornitog\u00eanicos.. \n\n? Avaliar o regime anual e sazonal de umidade e a din\u00e2mica t\u00e9rmica da camada ativa de dois solos \nsobre diferente cobertura vegetal e elucidar a influ\u00eancia da cobertura vegetal no \n\ncomportamento hidrotermal dos solos em estudo. \n\n? E no futuro com os resultados da tese gerar tamb\u00e9m mapas de geomorfologia e vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1rea em \nestudo, incluindo um banco de dados dos Criossolos, com dados anal\u00edticos e camadas de \n\ninforma\u00e7\u00f5es para poss\u00edvel adi\u00e7\u00e3o em ambiente Web-SIG. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nREFER\u00caNCIAS BIBLIOGR\u00c1FICAS  \n \n \nAlbuquerque-Filho, M.R., 2005.

Twenty-six soil profiles from study area were described, sampled and \n\nanalyzed for their physical, chemical and mineralogical attributes. Results showed soils are most formed \n\nfrom weathered basalt-andesitic rocks, naturally rich in apatite, with high P background. Typic \n\nDystrogelepts ornithic and Typic Gelorthents ornithic are the main ornithogenic soils in study area, \n\nwhich possibly represents one of the first ice-free areas colonized by penguins in Maritime Antarctica. \n\nTypic Dystrogelepts ornithic represent the deepest, most structured and reddish soils in the area. Typic \n\nHaplogelepts ornithic are the main soils on first and second moraine levels from the White Eagle \n\nGlacier. Typic Haploturbels and Lithic Haploturbels are present just above 80 m a.s.l., especially on the \n\ntop areas and paraglacial spots, and represent Gelisols in study area, with gelic materials within 100 cm \n\nand permafrost within 200 cm from the soil surface. Despite their occurrence only at higher altitudes, \n\nthey represent the greatest soil cover in Lions Rump. Turbic Haplogelepts and Typic Haplorthents are \n\nsituated between 40 and 80 m.a.s.l., without bird nesting influence and absent of permafrost within 200 \n\ncm depth. Vitrandic Cryopsamments and Oxyaquic Cryopsamments dominated the first level of terraces \n\nand former beaches along the coastal area. Other soils classified are present in very limited areas: Lithic \n\nCryorthents ornithic on the sea stacks rock outcrops (basaltic plugs) close to the beach, and Typic \n\nGelifluvents ornithic in a small area on glacial alluvial fans. Overall, soil distribution and classification \n\nin Lions Rump allowed identified two main soil domains: Ornithogenic soils (without permafrost) and \n\nthe Gelisols (above 80 m a.s.l.). \n\n  \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nSoil formation in Antarctica is restricted to about 0.32% or 45.000 km2 of the continent, in ice-\n\nfree regions of coastal areas and glacial valleys between mountain ranges (Ugolini and Bockheim, \n\n2008). The first study with Antarctica soils was carried in McMurdo US Base by Jensen (1916), and the \n\nfirst field study and soil mapping compiled occurred in the Taylor Valley of southern Victoria Land by \n\nMcCraw (1967) (Ugolini and Bockheim, 2008). Despite increased research on soils in recent years, \n\nmost studies on Maritime Antarctica focused mainly Ornithogenic soils. In addition, only few soil maps \n\nwere produced throughout the history of pedology in Antarctica.  \n\nGelisols order was approved in 1996 as the 12th order in Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, \n\n1999) and included in the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2006) to comprise the permafrost-affected soils and \n\nare divided into three suborders: Histels, Turbels, and Orthels. Histels are organic soils containing \n\npermafrost within 100 cm of the surface. Orthels are soils with gelic materials within 100 cm of the soil \n\nsurface and permafrost within 200 cm of the soil surface and the Orthels are soils with permarfrost \n\nwithin 100 cm and minimal cryoturbation. \n\n Ugolini and Bockheim, 2008 in a review observed that in Antarctica soils with ice-cemented \n\npermafrost within 70 cm of the surface generally are cryoturbated and classified in the Turbel suborder, \n\nand soils with dry permafrost and minimal cryoturbation are classified as Orthels. Soils in coastal \n\nregions of Antarctica are in HaploGreat Groups, and soils further inland in areas receiving less than 50 \n\nmm of water-equivalent precipitation are in Anhy Great Groups. Antarctica soils are further \n\ndifferentiated at the subgroup level based upon the amount and type of salts and other diagnostic \n\nfeatures (Ugolini and Bockheim, 2008). \n\nAlthough the temperatures are very low in Antarctic, in the region a chemical weathering occurs. \n\nSome studies showed chemical weathering in Gelisols occurring a greater extent than previously \n\nthought (Blume and Bolter, 1993; Simas et al., 2006; Schaefer et al, 2008). \n\nOne of the characteristics of Gelisols is their very low clay content, which even in the oldest \n\nsoils from Continental Antarctica seldom exceeds 4% (Beyer et al., 1999). Moreover, in the Maritime \n\nAntarctic, clay content can reach ? 20%, overcoming continental area and indicating advanced \n\nweathering in this region. In general terms, in Continental Antarctica, the youngest soils are found in the \n\ncoastal regions and lower valleys, and the oldest ones at higher altitudes inland (Beyer et al., 1999). \n\nHowever, in the Maritime Antarctic, more developed soils are close to the ocean, especially in soils \n\nknown as ornithogenic soils, formed in areas influenced by bird\u2019s activities. \n\nIn the Maritime Antarctic, the mean annual temperature is considerably higher (-1 to -3\u00b0C) than \n\nthe continental area, with two to four months of higher temperatures in the coastal locations and at low \n\naltitudes. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm (Bockheim and Ugolini, 1990). Under these \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\nclimate conditions, occurs a higher biodiversity and two higher plants are found in addition to the lower \n\nplants observed in East Antarctica. \n\n In the peripheric areas of Antarctica, it has been verified an increase in ice-free areas and soil \n\nformation, which deserve further studies to support management programs for preservation of the \n\nregion. Soil maps provide a very important base for environmental management and planning human \n\nactivities, as well as for ecological studies on terrestrial ecosystems (Moura et al., 2012).  \n\nSome studies and soil mapping were produced for Maritime Antarctica (Francelino et al., 2011; \n\nMichel, 2011; Moura et al., 2012; Pereira, 2012). These works produced soil maps for ice-free areas in \n\nSouth Shetlands Archipelago and Antarctic Peninsula to support the ANTPAS project (The Antarctic \n\nand Sub-Antarctic Permafrost, Soils and Periglacial Environments). Although sites of Byers Peninsula, \n\nFildes Peninsula, and other areas from Admiralty Bay had been concluded, no mapping soils had \n\npublished for Lions Rump, in King George Bay. For this reason, the present paper report soil survey and \n\ndiscuss main soil classes identified in Lions Rump, and also present a first approximation of the soil \n\nmap of area, highlighting selected soil chemical, physical and mineralogical attributes and its \n\nrelationship with the vegetation cover. \n\n \n\n \n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS \n\nSite description \n\nLions Rump is a small peninsula located on the southern coast of King George Bay, King \n\nGeorge Island, in the South Shetlands Islands, Maritime Antarctica (Figure 1). The area is designated as \n\nthe Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI N\u00b0 34) and takes its name Lions Rump from the distinctive \n\nrocky hill lying between the southern extremity of King George Bay and Lions Cove. The study area is \n\ndefined as terrestrial land within following coordinates: 62\u00b007\u201948\u2019\u2019S, 58\u00b009\u201917\u2019\u2019W; 62\u00b007\u201949\u2019\u2019S, \n\n58\u00b007\u201914\u2019\u2019W; 62\u00b008\u201919\u2019\u2019S, 58\u00b007\u201919\u2019\u2019W; and 62\u00b008\u201916\u2019\u2019S, 58\u00b009\u201915\u2019\u2019W (SCAR, 2002). According to \n\nK\u00f6ppen's classification, the region is part of the ET, tundra climate. Data sets acquired at the Brazilian \n\nCommandant Ferraz, nearby station from Lions Rump, report mean air temperatures varying from \u2013 6.4 \n\n\u00b0C in July to + 2.3 \u00b0C in February. Mean annual precipitation is proximally to 400 mm (Simas et al., \n\n2007), but the real soil water regime is highly influenced by its position in the landscape, due to the \n\nintense melting of snow, glaciers and permafrost sites upstream during the summer. The temperature \n\nremains above freezing almost all summer (November to March) allowing the vigorous growth of plant \n\ncommunities, mainly mosses, lichens and algae (Schaefer et al., 2004).  The area includes the littoral \n\nand sublittoral zones extending from the eastern end of Lajkonik Rock to the most northerly point of \n\nTwin Pinnacles. From this point, the boundary extends to the easternmost end of the columnar plug of \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\nLions Head to the east of White Eagle Glacier. On land, the area includes the coast of raised beaches, \n\nfreshwater pools and streams on the south side of King George Bay, around Lions Cove, and the \n\nmoraines and slopes which lead to the lower ice tongue of White Eagle Glacier, then westward to a \n\nsmall moraine which protrudes through the ice cap south-east of Sukiennice Hills. \n\nThe geology of Lions Rump is formed by Tertiary lavas and tuff containing thin brown coal \n\nintercalations and petrified wood fragments and Quaternary deposits. The front of White Eagle Glacier \n\nis marked by large, dome-shaped moraine ridges belonging to several Holocene stages of glacier \n\nadvance and retreat (Birkenmajer, 1994; Scar, 2002).  \n\nTwo Tertiary lithostratigraphic groups are described, separated one from another by an important \n\nfault: the Polonia Glacier Group (volcanic and volcanoclastic rocks, Eocene) in the north, and the \n\nChopin Ridge Group (Upper Cretaceous and Oligocene volcanics, and Lower Oligocene glacial and \n\nglacio-marine deposits) in the south. Both groups consist of several units of formation and member \n\nranks (Birkenmajer, 1994).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Lions Rump located at King George Bay, King George Island, South Shetlands, \nMaritime Antarctica. \n\n \nThe Quaternary deposits consist of three generations of moraines, outwash shoreline and raised \n\nbeach deposits. The first generations of moraines were formed as a result of glacier advance in the \n\nsecond half of the 18th century, the second one prior to 1960, and the third one between 1988 and 1991.  \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nThe first generation marginal (lateral) of moraine occurs on both sides of the valley of the \n\nnortheastern side of White Eagle Glacier ended in the cliffs of marine abrasion, being bordered by \n\nrecent pebble dikes up to 3.5 m tall. The second generation is representing by an isolated crescentic \n\nridge which reaches down to sea shore at King George Bay and is covered by younger generation \n\nmoraines at its landward termination. The late and younger generation moraines form several ridges at \n\nthe margin of the White Eagle Glacier, which steeply descend towards Lions Cove and King George \n\nBay, and cover the recent beach. An outwash apron is being formed at the outlet of a glacier river which \n\ncuts a deep canyon into the recent moraines; and smaller outwash cones are present on both sides of the \n\nolder moraine ridge (Birkenmajer, 1981; Birkenmajer, 1994).  \n\nAlong the shoreline, pebbly storm ridges cutting off small lagoons developed. Traces of raised \n\nbeaches with well-rounded pebbles are visible at 15 to20 m.a.s.l. on a morphological ridge dividing \n\nLions Cove from King George Bay (Birkenmajer, 1981). \n\nThe ice-free area exhibits a range of geomorphological features, including beaches of various \n\nwidths and length, moraines, hills and inland rocks.  \n\n \n\nField works \n\nThe study area was visited on austral summer of 2009/2010, during Brazilian Antarctic \n\nExpeditions. During field work, 26 pedons (Tables 1, 2 and 3) representing the main soil types identified \n\nin ice-free areas of Lions Rump were described and sampled, based on criteria established by Antarctic \n\nPermafrost and Soils (ANTPAS, 2006) and considering geomorphological features. For soil \n\nclassification USDA Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 2010) and World Reference Base for Soil \n\nResources (WRB) (ISSS Working Group, 2006) were used. For a detailed soil mapping, the free-choice \n\nprofiling (Embrapa, 1995) was used. The cartographic reference material was a Quickbird image (scale \n\n1:4500). Software ArcGIS 9.3 (ESRI, 2009) was used for data processing and map editing. Amoung the \n\n26 soils profiles, 13 more representative are selected and showed in this paper (Figure 2, 3 and 4). \n\n \n\nLaboratory procedures \n\nAfter soil sampling and transport to Brazil, soil analyses were carried out. Soil physic was \n\nanalyzed with texture procedure (EMBRAPA, 1997 modified by Ruiz, 2005). Soil chemical attributes \n\nanalyzed were: pH (H2O and 1 mol L\n-1 KCl) ; total organic carbon (TOC) in extracts of fulvic acid, \n\nhumic acid and humin fractions (Yeomans and Bremner, 1988), Na and K after extraction with 0.5 mol \n\nL-1 HCl + 0.0125 mol L-1 H2SO4 (Mehlich-1); available P (Mehlich-1), Ca\n , Mg, and Al after extraction \n\nwith 1 mol L-1 KCl; H+Al after extraction with 0.5 mol L-1 Ca(CH3COO)2 at pH 7.0; CaCO3 by titration \n\nafter extraction with 0.5 mol L-1 HCl. All chemical analyses were carried according to EMBRAPA \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\n(1997). Samples were analyzed for total contents of Ca, Mg, K, Fe, Al, Mn, P, Cu, Zn, Cd, As, Cr, and \n\nPb after total digestion sieved (mesh 0.25 mm) material with HCl, HNO3 and HF by heating in a \n\nmicrowave oven (CEM/MDS 2000) according to the EPA-3052 method (USEPA. 2011). The element \n\ncontents were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Soil \n\nmineralogical composition of clay fraction was evaluated on air-dried samples by X-ray diffraction \n\n(XRD) in natural clay and in clay samples after saturation with 1.0 mol L-1 KCl; heating in an oven at \n\n350 \u00baC and 550 \u00b0C for 3 hours each; saturation with 1.0 mol L-1 MgCl2 and glycerol solvation. A \n\ndiffractometer (PANalytical / X `Pert Pro) was used, operated at a voltage of 40 kV and current of 30 \n\nmA with CoK? radiation within the range between 4 and 50 \u00b02?, at step of 0.017 \u00b02? to 1 step s-1.  \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n \n\nGeneral characterization of the studied area \n\nLions Rump is propicious to development of diverse species of flora and fauna. The principal \n\nvegetation cover, geographic distribution and soil classification of studied area soils are presented at \n\ntable 1. \n\nIn general, soils from Lions Rump are incipient and poorly evolved when classified by WRB and \n\nSoil Taxonomy. Four of present soils from this study are Ornithogenic Soils, and the others are mainly \n\nCryosols/ Gelisols located in the highest landscaping portion. Cambisol/Inceptsol and (Regosols, \n\nArenosols, Leptsols)/Entsols are widespread in the lowland area. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\n \n\n   \n\nP3 - Turbic Haplogelepts P19 - Oxyaquic Cryopsamments P12 - Lithic Haploturbels \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Some representative Non-ornithogenic soils profiles of Lions Rump and their location in the \nlandscape \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLR12 \n\nLR3 \n\nLR19 \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\n \n\n   \n\nLR7- Typic Dystrogelepts ornithic LR8 - Typic Dystrogelepts ornithic LR9 - Typic Gelorthents ornithic \n\nFigure 3 \u2013Some representative Acid pH ornithogenic soils profiles of Lions Rump and location of profiles in \nthe landscape. \n\n \n\nLR8 LR7 \n\nLR9 \n\nLR15 \n\nLR23 \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\n \n\n   \n\nLR11 - Typic Haplogelepts ornithic LR15 - Typic Haplogelepts ornithic LR23 - Typic Gelifluvents ornithic \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Some representative Neutral pH ornithogenic soils profiles of Lions Rump and their location in the \nlandscape.\n\nLR11 LR23 \nLR15 \n\nLR21 \n\nLR8 \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\nTable 1: Geographic distribution, altitude, vegetation cover and soil classification of 13 selected profiles from 26 studied \n \n\nGroup Pedon \nGeographic \n\nposition1 \nAltitude \nm.a.s.l2 \n\nVegetation3 WRB4 Soil Taxonomy \n\nN\no\n\nn\n \u2013\n\n O\nrn\n\nit\nh\n\no\ng\n\nen\nic\n\n S\no\n\nil\ns \n\nLR3 \n0439687 \n3110784 \n\n62 \nRare \n\nD.C.L.M \nHaplic Cambisol (Eutric, Skeletic, \nTurbic, Gelic) \n\nLoamy-skeletal, mixed, active, subgelic, \nTurbic Haplogelepts \n\nLR4 \n0439762 \n3110565 \n\n102 \nRare \n\nD.C.L.M \nTurbic Cambic Cryosol (Eutric, \nSkeletic) \n\nLoamy-skeletal, mixed, active, subgelic, \nTypic Haplorthels \n\nLR5 \n0440047 \n3110231 \n\n110 Absent \nHaplic Regosol (Eutric, Skeletic, \nGelic) \n\nLoamy-skeletal, mixed, active, subgelic, \nTypic Gelorthents \n\nLR12 \n0440724 \n3108658 \n\n257 L>D>C>M Leptic Cryosol (Eutric, Skeletic) \nLoamy-skeletal, mixed, active, subgelic, \nLithic Haploturbels \n\nLR13 \n0440804 \n3108792 \n\n222 Absent \nTurbic Thionic Cryosol (Epieutric, \nEndoalumic,  Skeletic) \n\nLoamy-skeletal, mixed, active, subgelic, \nTypic Haplorthels \n\nLR19 \n0440081 \n3110799 \n\n3 D>M>C Haplic Arenosol (Eutric, Gelic) \nSandy, mixed, active, subgelic, Oxyaquic \nCryopsamments \n\nLR21 \n0441211 \n3109813 \n\n67 M>D >C \nHaplic Cambisol (Eutric,Turbic, \nGelic, Oxyaquic) \n\nCoarse-loamy, mixed, active, subgelic,   \nTurbic Haplogelepts \n\nLR24 \n0441165 \n3109959 \n\n86 L>D>C>M \nTurbic Cambic Cryosol (Eutric, \nSkeletic) \n\nSandy-skeletal, mixed, active, subgelic,   \nTypic Haploturbels \n\nA\nci\n\nd\n p\n\nH\n  \n\nO\nrn\n\nit\nh\n\no\ng\n\nen\nic\n\n \nS\n\no\nil\n\ns LR8 \n0441398 \n3110372 \n\n38 D>M>P>L \nHaplic Cambisol (Ornithic.

D= Deschampsia Antarctica. M= Mosses, L= Lichens, P = Plasiola \ncrispa; 4 Classification following World Reference Base for Soil Resources (2006). \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\nVegetation \n\nVegetation especies were identified with help of botanist researchers Ant\u00f4nio Batista \n\nPereira and Lucas Marinho Poeiras. \n\nThe presence of Prasiola crispa is associated with proximity of penguin rookeries. \n\nThis type of algae occurs in N-rich soils. Lichens are widespread on rocks or rock fragments \n\nin all order of soils present at study area. The lichens species observed at Lions Rump were \n\nAcarospora sp, Bacidia sp, Buellia sp, Caloplaca cinericola, Caloplaca regalis, Candelaria \n\nflava, Cornicularia aculeate, Haematomma erytromma, Lecanora polytropa, Lecidea sp, \n\nLeptogium puberulum, Mastodia tesselata, Ochrolechia antarctica, Ochrolechia frigida,  \n\nPhyscia caesia, Placopsis contortuplicata, Psoroma cinnamomeum, Ramalina terebrata, \n\nRhizocarpon geographicum, Rhizoplaca sp, Sphaerophorus globosus, Usnea antarctica, \n\nUsnea aurantiaco-atra and Xanthoria candelaria. On the other hand, species as Buellia sp., L. \n\npuberulum and U. antarctica are also frequently observed covering vegetated soils. At higher \n\nelevations, soils are practically devoid of vegetation cover except for sparse epilithic lichens. \n\nAbove 80 m a.s.l., Usnea is the principal lichen occurring on Gelisols (Cryosol).  \n\nFlowering plants are representing only by Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus \n\nquitensis, which occurs principally on Quaternary features, with dense covering on uplifted \n\nterraces, beaches, moraines and abandoned rookeries. \n\nMosses are found mostly in wet areas forming carpets or cushions in other soils. At \n\nwetter sites, cryptogrammic organisms extend as a continuous cover, and A horizons are \n\nformed. A sharp boundary is observed between the A horizon and the underlying B horizon, \n\nwith reduction of organic C with depth. The field of mosses in the southern part of the Lions \n\nRump peninsula covering a large area, as identified in LR21 profile, is in process of \n\ndegradation because of melting water drainages. The found mosses in Lions Rump were \n\nAndreaea gainii, Brachytecium sp, Bryum argenteum, Bryum dichotomum, Bryum \n\npseudotriquetrum, Polytrichum alpinum, Sanionia uncinata, Schistidium falcatum and \n\nSyntrichia princeps. \n\nOn the breeding rookery all vegetation has been devastated due to excessive manuring \n\nand trampling by penguins as previously indicated as Ugolini (1970, 1972), Tatur (1989), \n\nMichel et al. (2006) and Simas et al. (2007) studying ice-free areas of the South Shetlands \n\nIslands. Only nitrophilous lichens can be noted on big stones and rocky walls. But in marginal \n\nzones of penguin activity abundance of nutrients in water running down from the rookery and \n\nspread by the wind ensures luxurious development of vegetation. This seems to be a standard \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\nin Maritime Antarctica with reports by Tatur and Myrcha,1989; 1991; Tatur et al., 1997; \n\nMichel et al, 2006; Simas et al., 2007, 2008; and Schaefer et al., 2008.  \n\n \n\nSoil classification and characteristics \n\nDeposition of P and N-rich guano favors vegetation establishment. Soil chemical \n\nproperties, mineralogy and the type of vegetation are strongly influenced by the duration of \n\nsite occupation by penguins and soil drainage characteristics. Because of this avifauna \n\ninfluence we can divide soils from Lions Rump in three groups (Table 2): Acid pH \n\nornithogenic soils (LR8, LR9) (Figure 3), Neutral pH ornithogenic soils (LR15, LR22, LR23) \n\n(Figure 4), and Non-ornithogenic soils (LR3, LR4, LR5, LR12, LR 13, LR19, LR21, LR24) \n\n(Figure 2). \n\nIn oldest and most stable landscapes where bird's occupation has been long domain \n\nAcid pH ornithogenic soils (LR8), which are mostly common cited in the literature widely \n\nknown just like ornithogenic soils (Ugolini, 1972; Tatur and Barczuk, 1985; Tatur and \n\nMyrcha, 1989, 1991, 1993; Tatur et al., 1997; Michel et al., 2006; Simas et al., 2007, 2008, \n\nand Schaefer et al., 2008). The Acid pH ornithogenic soils are readily distinguished from the \n\nNon-ornithogenic soil by several features such as the presence of continuous vegetation cover \n\nwith D. antarctica, C. quitensis and/or Prasiola crispa; lower pH and bases saturation (PBS); \n\nvery high Melich-1 extractable-P, exchangeable Al, TOC and total N (Table 3). Concentration \n\nof K+, P and Al3+ tend to increase in the deepest layer while Ca2+ and Mg2+ and pH tend to \n\nreduce.  \n\nThe Neutral pH ornithogenic soils show high levels of label P and similar vegetation \n\ncover as Acid pH ornithogenic soils. However they have high concentration of Ca2+, Mg2+ \n\nand K+ and pH close to neutral. They are present at areas with recently exposure to \n\nornithogenic influence, especially at Quaternary moraines and uplifted terrace (LR15 and \n\nLR23). The principal difference between acid and Neutral ornithogenic soils is time of soil \n\nexposure to bird influence and the amount of bird excrement depositions. \n\nMean pH for Acid ornithogenic soils studied was 4.3 (\u00b10.33), much lower than the \n\nmean values for Neutral ornithogenic soils (7.0 \u00b11.2) and Non-ornithogenic soils (7.4 \u00b11.1) \n\n(Table 3). Such acidity is produced during guano mineralization, through the production of \n\nstrong acids such as HNO3 (Tatur and Barczuk, 1985). \n\nAt Neutral ornithogenic soils, both cation exchange capacity (CEC) and percentage of \n\nbase saturation (PBS) are high and represent an eutrophic soil, contrasting with dystrophic \n\nAcid ornithogenic soils with low CEC (Table 3). \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\nTable 2- Morphological and physical properties of studied soils from Lions Rump \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSoil Pedon \nDepth \n\ncm \nStructure1 Transition \n\nColor \n(dry) \n\nSkel2 C.Sand F.

The extremely high Melich-1 \n\nextractable-P for the highest and most ancient ornithogenic soil (LR7) indicates that P \n\nminerals constitute stable P reserves at these sites, as confirmed by XRD analysis (data not \n\nshow for LR7), besides the greater amount of P as amorphous mineral and organic form. \n\nMean extractable P in Acid ornithogenic soil is more than ten times higher than the levels \n\nobserved for Non-ornithogenic soils while exchangeable Ca2+ is more than nine times lower. \n\nSimilar results were observed by Moura et al., (2012) studying soils from Byers Peninsula, \n\nLivingston Island. As it has been show for similar soils from Maritime Antarctica (Simas et \n\nal., 2006, 2007), soils development in such conditions are marked by the instability of P\u2013Ca \n\nphases. Soil acidity also alters clay minerals and rock forming minerals with formation of P\u2013\n\nAl\u2013K phases of varyed crystallinity (Simas et al., 2006). In such pedoenvironements, \n\nphosphatization is the main soil forming process and determines soils overall chemistry and \n\necosystem functioning (Tatur and Barczuk, 1985; Simas et al., 2007). \n\nThe highest content of Melich-1 extractable-P was obtained for the first layers of the \n\nmost recently abandoned rookery (LR9, Table 3). High P values in depth for LR7 (not show) \n\nindicate P illuviation after site abandonment by penguins. A detailed study of clay-sized \n\nminerals for Antarctic soils with different degrees of ornithogenic influence is presented by \n\nSimas et al. (2006) and Schaefer et al (2008). \n\nThe soils from penguin rookeries and adjacent areas are more developed than soils \n\nwith no faunal influence, as observed when comparing LR8 with LR3. A stony/pebbly \n\npavement is present in all sites but is often hidden by the well-developed and continuous \n\nvegetation in ornithogenic sites. Clear horizon differentiation occurs and a relatively deep \n\norganic matter-rich A horizons and phosphatic B horizons were easily identified. Surface \n\nhorizons are dark and yellowish brown as a result of humus incorporation corroborating the \n\nstudy of Simas et al. (2008) and Michel et al. (2006) in other areas of King George Island. \n\nIn the most developed ornithogenic soils (LR8), the surface horizons have lower P \n\ncontents in comparison with depth horizons, due to plant uptake, organic material \n\naccumulation over old layers of guano deposition, concomitantly with P leaching (Table 3). \n\nIn the absence of ornithogenic activity, the soil chemical weathering in Antarctic is \n\nless pronounced and soils present chemical and mineralogical characteristics main influenced \n\nby the parent material. For Non-ornithogenic soils in Lions Rump, high pH, Ca2+ and Mg2+ \n\nlevels, and salinity are usually observed, as verified in LR4, LR5 and LR12; and K+ \n\nconcentration is lower than in ornithogenic soils, which receive K+ deposition from guano.  \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\nThe mean P content in Non-ornithogenic soils was 102.7 \u00b1 48.0 mg/dm3, which is an \n\nexpressive concentration for soils without bird influence, but occurs because these soils are \n\nmost formed from weathered basalt-andesitic rocks, naturally present apatite as mineal \n\naccessory. \n\nEven in areas with some stagnant water (LR19, LR21 and LR 25), no redoximorphic \n\nfeatures were observed, as described by Blume et al. (2002) and Simas et al. (2008) for some \n\nhydromorphic soils of Maritime Antarctic. No features of salinization were observed either in \n\nany profile studied, neither podzolization, even in soils with high sand content.  \n\nAcid sulfate soils as a product of oxidation sulfides, as described by Simas et al. \n\n(2006) and Simas et al. (2008) in Admiralty Bay, occurs at one unique site at Lions Rump \n\nwhere it is formed from sulfide bearing andesites and related tills. These soils are represented \n\nby LR13 profile, which present much lower pH (3.62), high contents of exchangeable Al3+ \n\n(19.5 cmolc.dm\n-3) and H+Al (28.1 cmolc/dm\n\n3), and very low P contents (6.9 mg.dm-3). In the \n\nclay fraction of this soil, jarosite and smectite are the principal minerals (Figure 7). This \n\nprofile also present signals of ashes from the last volcanic eruption from Penguin Island.  \n\nSoils from Lions Rump present relatively low amounts of fine particles, clay (9.2%) \n\nand silt (24.9%) (Table 2), in comparison to other soils from Admiralty Bay. Clay contents \n\nare higher at Ornithogenic soils contrasting with results of Simas et al. (2008), who found \n\nlower clay proportion for Ornithogenic in comparison with non-ornithogenic. All soils are \n\ngravelly and with similar content of particles > 2 mm, but a tendency to be more skeletal is \n\nverified for soils formed from bedrock Tertiary materials and at higher altitudes (Table 2). \n\nThe soil structure from Lions Rump is dominated for weak, medium-sized, blocks and \n\nmoderate medium granular features, domining clear to gradual wavy transition between \n\nhorizons what may confirm the weak cryoturbation features in this area (Table 2). \n\nThe studies of Simas et al. (2008) who described 56 pedons distributed in the major \n\nice-free areas of Keller Peninsula, Cr\u00e9pin Point, Rakusa Point, Llano Point, Hennequin Point \n\nand Ullman Point, and Michel et al. (2006) who studied \u201cCopabacana area\u201d indicate that most \n\nsoils studied in Admiralty Bay present permafrost in the upper 200 cm in January 2003, and \n\ntherefore, can be fitted within the Gelisol order of Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 2010) \n\nand in the Cryosol Major Group of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (ISSS, \n\n2006). Typical cryoturbation features such as patterned ground (i.e. stone circles, stripes and \n\nearth hummocks), irregular and broken horizons, vertical orientation of stones within the soil \n\nprofile, buried organic matter, and formation of silt caps were commonly observed, as \n\nindicated for Bockheim and Tarnocai (1998) and Tarnocai et al. (2004). In Lions Rump area, \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\nnone of the ornithogenic soils was classified as Gelisol and cryoturbation features are not \n\ncommonly observed. Soils with permafrost occur only above 80 m.a.s.l. and for all studied \n\nprofiles and they are deeper than 100 cm. For this reason, we can just classify them as Gelisol \n\nbecause they have a cryic horizon starting within 200 cm from soil surface and evidence of \n\ncryoturbation in some layer within 100 cm of the soil surface. \n\n \n\nTotal organic carbon and humic substances \n\nAlthough biomass production by Antarctic vegetation is scarce, it frequently exceeds \n\ndecomposition capacity of local microbiota, which is limited by climate conditions (Ugolini. \n\n1972). Then, low temperatures and moisture are crucial for the low microbial activity and \n\nhumification rate (formation of humic substances) of Antarctic soils (Pereira, 2012). \n\nTherefore, organic matter accumulates at some specific sites and plays important pedological \n\nand ecological roles (Beyer et al, 1995; Beyer. 2000; B\u00f6lter and Kandeler. 2004; Simas et al, \n\n2008). \n\nThe sea\u2013land transfer of matter and nutrients favors vegetation development and \n\nposition of ornithogenic soils in landscape. These soils are the main terrestrial organic carbon \n\npool of Maritime Antarctica (Simas et al., 2007). In Lions Rump total organic carbon for \n\nornithogenic soils are approximately four times higher than for Non-ornithogenic soils.  \n\nThe fractionation of humic substances in ornithogenic soil indicated averages of 0.55 \n\ndag kg-1 fulvic acids (FA), 0.83 dag kg-1 humic acids (HA), and 3.67 dag kg-1 humin (HU) \n\n(Table 4). In ornithogenic soils, HU contents are higher due to dense cover of higher plants \n\n(D. antarctica and C. quitensis), which are responsible for the incorporation of lignin from the \n\nroot system into the soil. These HU possibly are not a real humic substance, been a residual \n\norganic material without decomposition.  \n\n HA and AF fractions are probably present because they are provided by guano. In \n\nNon-ornithogenic soils, we found averages of 0.1 dag kg-1 fulvic acids (FA), 0.3 dag kg-1 \n\nhumin (HU) and no detectable humic acids (Table 4). These low contents are justified by the \n\nalmost absence of vegetation at these soils. \n\nPereira (2012) found for soils from Hope Bay, Antarctic Peninsula, HA dominating \n\nother carbon forms where vegetation is formed principal by mosses and lichen. They related \n\nthis high ratio HA/FA as indicative of higher degree of humification.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\nTable 4.

On the other hand, soils covered with P.crispa (LR23) or mosses (LR21) present an \n\nabrupt reduction of TOC with depth. Although ornithogenic soils exhibit high content of \n\nTOC, no umbric epipedon was described. For Non-ornithogenic soils, humin (HU) is almost \n\nthe only form of organic compounds; it is practically absent from organic matter label forms.  \n\nThe tendency of increasing HA/FA ratio with depth in Acid ornithogenic soils, as also \n\nobserved by Michel et al. (2006), can be associated to migration and reaction of organic \n\nmatter along the profile, causing polycondensation and accumulation of the more recalcitrant \n\nhumic substances in depth.  \n\n \n\nTotal elemental composition \n\nTotal mean contents of CaO, MgO and K2O were respectively 0.24; 0.05 dag kg\n-1, and \n\n1.02 dag kg-1 for Acid ornithogenic soils; 0.51, 0.08, and 0.43 dag kg-1,  for Neutral \n\nornithogenic soils; and 0.48, 0.11, and 0.72 dag kg-1 for Non-ornithogenic soils (Table 5). \n\nThese data show the reduction of CaO and MgO contents and the increasing of K2O in Acid \n\nornithogenic soil, what derivated from Ca and Mg leaching, K addition from guano and \n\nformation of phosphates mineral K-rich as taranakite.  \n\nPlagioclases were detected in all soils (see mineralogy). In this case, the presence of \n\neasily weathered primary minerals in clay fraction indicates a limited chemical change and the \n\neffect of cryoclasty, decreasing particles size and increasing CEC. The higher content of total \n\nK2O in comparison to exchangeable ones suggests that K is present mostly in non-\n\nexchangeable forms, possibly associated to the formation of phosphate clays, typical minerals \n\nfrom phosphatization process (Pereira, 2012), process as well as associated with the \n\nplagioclases in the soil (Figure 6, see mineralogy). \n\nMean contents of total P2O5 were 5.62 dag kg\n-1 for Acid ornithogenic soils, 0.43 dag \n\nkg-1 for Neutral ornithogenic soils, and 0.18 dag kg-1 for Non-ornithogenic soils (Table 5). \n\nThe P enrichment in sites with previous or current ornithogenesis influence is significative. \n\nThe P total in Acid ornithogenic soils is 31 times higher than Non-ornithogenic ones, which \n\nconfirm the importance of avifauna influence in soil transformation in these Antarctica \n\nenvironments. \n\n \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\nTable 5: Total elemental composition in &lt;2 mm air-dried soil samples from selected horizons of some soils studied from Lions Rump \n \n\nPedon \nDepth \n\ncm \nCaO MgO K2O F2O3 Al2O3 MnO P2O5 Cu Zn Cd As Cr Pb \n\n --------------------------dag kg -1------------------------- ------------------------mg kg -1----------------------- \nNon-ornithogenic soils \n\nLR3 \nA 0-5 0.64 0.15 0.89 8.58 3.15 0.12 0.16 92.2 87.2 11.1 13.2 103.4 22.5 \n\nAB 5-17/20 0.74 0.14 0.88 6.88 3.31 0.11 0.15 24.9 95.8 11.5 27.9 94.0 39.7 \n\nLR4 \nA 0-5 0.43 0.10 1.17 6.99 3.31 0.09 0.12 55.5 74.9 9.5 20.9 82.8 22.6 \nBi 24-45/47 0.46 0.12 1.18 7.17 3.13 0.10 0.13 60.5 85.9 8.6 14.8 73.5 19.1 \n\nLR5 C1 0-23 1.31 0.26 0.62 8.12 2.57 0.10 0.12 89.9 74.6 10.2 16.3 301.7 24.0 \n\nLR13 \nA 0-8 0.36 0.07 0.12 9.63 7.04 0.05 0.17 30.6 63.4 6.3 24.8 27.8 21.1 \nC 15-65 0.13 0.04 0.86 11.47 5.50 0.02 0.23 46.4 34.3 11.0 27.9 17.9 27.7 \n\nLR19 \nA 0-4 0.37 0.11 0.51 6.92 3.50 0.06 0.21 38.6 60.9 5.9 7.9 77.3 11.3 \nC1 15-30/35 0.35 0.10 0.55 8.50 3.93 0.04 0.29 46.1 66.8 4.0 6.5 37.5 4.0 \n\nLR24 \nA 0-8 0.26 0.08 0.57 8.42 3.88 0.06 0.22 34.3 56.4 5.0 4.0 50.9 6.7 \nBi 33-52 0.26 0.07 0.59 8.11 4.25 0.06 0.15 33.1 60.9 6.1 7.3 31.7 10.9 \n\nAcid pH Ornithogenic soils \n\nLR8 \n\nO 0-5 0.36 0.13 1.01 5.35 4.95 0.05 0.61 75.3 75.4 11.3 34.0 62.0 44.0 \nA 5-12 0.31 0.08 1.00 7.36 5.09 0.05 1.81 69.0 69.7 7.8 23.4 35.4 17.4 \n\nBA 18-32 0.15 0.02 1.00 9.28 5.00 0.03 6.50 72.6 72.2 7.5 19.9 30.1 15.0 \nB3 100-120 0.13 0.02 1.00 10.13 5.40 0.03 7.47 75.0 69.9 8.8 23.8 33.4 19.4 \n\nLR9 \nA 0-8 0.34 0.04 1.11 6.34 3.87 0.03 5.01 165.8 159.1 6.4 13.0 39.9 13.9 \nCr 8-40 0.16 0.02 1.02 7.98 5.06 0.02 12.32 157.1 105.8 8.7 37.8 35.9 28.2 \n\nNeutral pH Ornithogenic soils \n\nLR15 \nO1 0-3/4 0.66 0.21 0.73 7.84 3.53 0.07 0.82 61.6 96.2 7.9 20.2 142.6 21.6 \nOA 11-16/17 0.96 0.29 0.72 8.00 3.25 0.09 0.72 53.3 93.9 7.8 21.5 157.7 18.6 \nBi1 17-37/38 0.95 0.17 0.69 8.19 2.93 0.10 0.38 51.6 82.2 8.2 18.6 170.1 24.7 \n\nLR22 A 0-16 0.50 0.10 0.79 7.86 3.79 0.05 1.00 62.3 89.1 4.8 4.1 74.3 5.9 \n\nLR23 \nBi 10-22/24 0.36 0.10 0.51 9.47 3.35 0.06 0.25 47.0 66.0 5.5 7.3 45.8 3.8 \n2A 30-34/36 0.41 0.06 0.52 9.25 3.14 0.06 0.16 41.5 65.9 6.2 5.5 64.8 8.2 \n2C 34/36-90 0.22 0.03 1.91 10.31 3.84 0.07 0.17 80.4 87.4 10.5 12.8 48.0 14.7 \n\n \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\nMean total contents of Fe2O3 and Al2O3 were respectively, 7.74 and 4.90 dag kg\n-1 for \n\nAcid ornithogenic soils, 8.61 and 3.55 dag kg-1 for Neutral ornithogenic soils, and 8.25 and \n\n3.96 dag kg-1 for Non-Ornithogenic soils (Table 5). These data indicate these oxides are \n\nclosely related with the parent material, and no influence of guano on these contents. \n\nHowever, slightly higher content of Fe2O3 and Al2O3 in Acid ornithogenic soils in comparison \n\nto others may be related to more intensive weathering following by leaching of bases and \n\naccumulation of Fe and Al.  \n\nMean total heavy metal contents (Table 5) were 17.23 mg kg-1 (As), 7.94 mg kg-1 \n\n(Cd), 76.60 mg kg-1 (Cr), 65.19 mg kg-1 (Cu), 18.54 mg kg-1 (Pb), and 78.91 mg kg-1 (Zn). \n\nThese contents are lower than observed for Pereira (2012), except for Cd. \n\n. No large difference was observed between soil groups in heavy metal concentration \n\n(Table 5), indicating predomine influence of parent material lithology on these contents. A \n\nexemple of that is the higher levels of Zn determined in LR3, LR9 and LR15 belong a Non \n\nornithogenic, Neutral and Acid pH ornithogenic group, respectively.  \n\nConcerning metal distribution throughout the profile, contents exhibit irregular and \n\nnon-defined distribution pattern. No reference values for heavy metals in soils from Antarctic \n\nMaritime are available to comparisons; however paper showing the contamination of heavy \n\nmetals by anthropic actives are studied by Santos et al. (2005, 2007), Chaparro et al. (2007, \n\n2011) and  Guerra et al. (2011). \n\n \n\nSoil mineralogy \n\nThe X-ray diffraction patterns for Non-ornithogenic soils showed the presence of \n\nchlorite-vermiculite intergrade represent by peaks at 1.5 nm in clay fraction, which was not \n\nchanged after treatments with KCl, Mg and Mg + glycol saturation. However, this peak \n\ncollapsed to 1.00 nm after heating at 350 and 550 \u00b0C.   \n\nMinerals from feldspar group, including plagioclases, anorthite, albite and others are \n\nidentified from XDR peaks at 0.375, 0.33, 0.321, 0.318 and 0.303 nm. Presence of feldspar \n\nminerals in clay fraction it related to incipient leaching process of bases and Si, contributing \n\nto low chemical alteration in the thermodynamic equilibrium involving Ca, Mg and K. These \n\nresults suggest that although Maritime Antarctic is warmer and wetter than Continental \n\nAntarctica, chemical weathering process is still limited in this region as well. The absence of \n\nkaolinite formation is also other evidence of incipient weathering in these Non-ornithogenic \n\nsoils, even though this mineral has been found in few Antarctica soils, mainly in acid sulfate \n\nsoils. No difference in mineralogical composition of non ornithogenic soils was verified \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\nbetween Gelisols and Inceptsols (LR3 and LR12, respectively) from the same parental \n\nmaterial (figure 5), what can confirm that beside absence of permafrost in the Non-\n\nornithogenic Inceptsols, limited chemical weathering occurs only by physicals process of \n\npedoturbation and cryoclastic, which are the main process of soil formation in both soils (LR3 \n\nand LR12).  \n\nXRD patterns for clay fraction of LR15, a \u201cneutral pH ornithogenic soil\u201d (Figure 6), \n\nindicate no mineralogy alteration after short avifauna influence, therefore, despite the high \n\namount of P and TOC input by birds, short soil exposure to the penguin rookery was not \n\nenough to promote phospatization process, which is a transformation of silicate clay minerals \n\ninto phosphates. \n\nPhosphatization is evident in LR8 (Figure 6), where most silicate clay minerals were \n\ntransformed into crystalline and non-crystalline phosphates, mainly Taranakite. The main \n\nevidence for this is the complete absence of 2:1 secondary silicate clay minerals, as also \n\nobserved for the majority ornithogenic soil. Taranakite is not well crystallized, because peaks \n\ndisappear after any clay treatment. The clay treatment for XRD analysis is important for \n\nornithogenic soils to eliminate confusion between 2:1 and phosphate minerals at 1.6 nm peak.  \n\nThe process of weathering transforming primary silicate minerals into 2:1 and after \n\ninto 1:1 minerals is not common for Antarctica ornithogenic soils (Figure 6, LR8). When \n\nprimary minerals are weathered, bases in solution are complexed by phosphate in solution \n\nreducing bases activity to contents not enough to form secondary minerals. \n\nLR13 represents an acid sulfide soil formed from sulfide bearing andesites and related \n\ntills present in the top part of Lions Rump. This site is well-drained and presents clear \n\ncryoturbation features with presence of dead ice and peculiar yellowish colors. The oxidation \n\nof sulfides promotes soil acidification, leading to secondary sulfates formation such jarosite \n\n(Figure 7) and sulphuric horizons similar to those described by Simas et al. (2006) in \n\nAdmiralty Bay. Contrasting results from Simas et al. (2008) who found kaolinite in Antartica \n\nclay fraction, in Lions Rump this mineral was not detected in acid sulfide soils.  \n\nThe presence of clay-sized pyroxene, plagioclase and absence of kaolinite suggest an \n\nincipient degree of chemical alteration of parent material, despite the advanced acidification \n\nprocess (Figure 7). The main secondary silicate clay mineral present in this soil is chlorite-\n\nsmectite intergrade, as indicate by peak at 1.5 nm, that is maintained after K saturation, sifted \n\nto 1.8 nm after Mg+glycol treatment, and collapsed to 1.0 nm after heated to 550 \u00b0C. \n\nMaghemite is also detected, and with jarosite gives the expressive chrome color (10YR 5.5/8). \n\nAllophane is probably present and is derivate from ashes deposited on the sulphuric materials \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\nand mixed by cryoturbation process. These ashes came from the last eruption in Penguin \n\nIsland, and ash's evidence can be observed covering soils in marine terraces.   \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 5.

However, as previous observed by Simas et al. (2008), for \n\nSoil Taxonomy system, sulphuric qualifier is only applicable to Aquiturbels, which is \n\ndefinitely not the case for these well drained and oxidized soils. Therefore, our studies \n\nreinforce the proposal from Simas et al. (2008) to include the Sulphuric Haploturbel to \n\nclassify well drained cryoturbated soils with sulphuric materials in the upper 100 cm depth. \n\nAll soils studied presented high Feo/Fed ratio (Table 6), which usually indicates high \n\namounts of poorly crystalline forms and/or soil less developed, according to soil classification \n\npresented. However, in Lions Rump the highest Feo/Fed value is found for LR8 and LR9, \n\nboth Acid ornithogenic and more developed soils of study area.

These \n\nphases react with ornithogenic P, K and N to form amorphous and crystalline secondary \n\nphosphates and according to Simas et al., 2006, non-crystalline phases are important soil \n\ncomponents and reach >75% of the clay fraction for some ornithogenic soils.  \n\nSimas et al. (2006) found crystalline phosphates occurring only in soils directly \n\naffected by penguins (active and abandoned rookeries) as profiles LR9 and LR8 from Lions \n\nRump, respectively. The incongruent dissolution of crystalline Al\u2013Fe phosphates with \n\nformation of amorphous P-rich phases is considered the most common transformation with \n\nincreasing age of abandonment site (Tatur et al., 1997) and maintains high levels of labile P \n\nforms. On the other hand, at sites lower penguin influence (LR 11, LR15 and LR 23) P inputs \n\nare lower, and no crystalline phosphates are present. Therefore, the chemical characteristics of \n\nthese sites are controlled by highly reactive non-crystalline P minerals. \n\n \n\n \n\nSoil mapping \n\nBased on our soil survey we propose a first approximation of the soil map for Lions \n\nRump (Figure 8). Soil units mapped in study area were: Lithic Cryorthents (2.55 ha), Typic \n\nDystrogelepts ornithic (0.93 ha), Typic Gelifluvents ornithic (1.75 ha), Typic Gelorthents \n\nornithic (1.69 ha), Typic Haplogelepts ornithic (9.45 ha), Association: Turbic Haplogelepts \n\nand Typic Gelorthents (30.91 ha), Association: Oxyaquic Cryopsamments and Vitrandic \n\nCryopsamments (15.45 ha), Association: Typic Haplogelepts and Typic Gelorthents (3.44 ha), \n\nAssociation: Typic Haploturbels + Lithic Haploturbels (163.86 ha). \n\nTypic Dystrogelepts ornithic and Typic Gelorthents ornithic are the main vegetated \n\nsoils in Lions Rump, which possibly represents one of the first ice-free areas colonized by \n\npenguins in Maritime Antarctica. Typic Dystrogelepts ornithic maybe represent the deepest, \n\nmost structured and reddish soils so far described in Maritime Antarctica. Typic Haplogelepts \n\nornithic represent the main soils on first and second moraine levels from the White Eagle \n\nGlacier. Typic Haploturbels and Lithic Haploturbels are present only above 80 m.a.s.l., \n\nespecially on the top areas and paraglacial spots, and represent Gelisols from Lions Rump, \n\nwith gelic materials within 100 cm of the soil surface and permafrost within 200 cm from the \n\nsoil surface. Despite their occurrence only at higher altitudes, they represent the largest soil \n\ncover in the studied area. Typic Haploturbels and Lithic Haploturbels are present at the edge \n\nof White Eagle Glacier, where cryoturbation process is more expressive.  \n\n \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\nFigure 8 \u2013 Soil map and land covers of Lions Rump, Maritime Antarctic. \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\nTurbic Haplogelepts and Typic Gelorthents are situated between 40 and 80 m.a.s.l., \n\nwithout bird nesting influence and absent of permafrost within 200 cm in the profile. \n\nVitrandic Cryopsamments and Oxyaquic Cryopsamments dominated the first level of terraces \n\nand former beaches along the coastal area. Other soils classified are present in very limited \n\nareas: Lithic Cryorthents ornithic, present on the sea stacks rock outcrops (basaltic plugs) \n\nclose to the beach, and Typic Gelifluvents ornithic represent a small area on glacial alluvial \n\nfans and Typic Haplorthels represents an acid sulfide soil formed from sulfide bearing \n\nandesites and related tills present in the top part of Lions Rump. \n\n \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\nAt upland sites with no vegetation or ornithogenic influence, soil chemistry and \n\nmineralogy are related mainly to the physical weathering from basaltic till.  \n\nOrnithogenic influence alters soils characteristics leading to soil acidification, leaching \n\nof exchangeable bases, transformation of primary minerals and releasing of amorphous Fe \n\nand Al. These phases react with ornithogenic P, and phosphatization process occurs. This is \n\nthe main soil forming process in Lions Rump and promotes predominantly phosphatic fine \n\nfraction and a significative increase of soil P pool, with very high levels of labile and \n\nmoderately labile P forms.  \n\nCrystalline Al and Fe phosphates persist in soils even after site abandonment by \n\npenguins and act as P reserves. \n\nHaplorthels and Haploturbels are the main soil of Lions Rump situated on the higher \n\nice-free areas. \n\nHigher P and N contents at ornithogenic sites favour vegetation establishment with \n\npresence of D. antarctica and C. quitensis. High organic carbon contents characterize \n\nornithogenic sites as important C sinks at Antarctica terrestrial ecosystems. \n\nThe degree of ornithogenic influence can be assessed through the analysis of soils \n\nmorphological, chemical and mineralogical characteristics. The study of these characteristics \n\nallowed the proposal of provisory diagnostic criteria for the ornithogenic qualifier, providing \n\na better classification of these unique soils within the WRB and Soil Taxonomy systems. \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\nREFER\u00caNCIAS BIBLIOGR\u00c1FICAS \n\n \n\nAntarctic Permafrost and Soils \u2013 ANTPAS, 2006.

Although use of techniques as WDS, \n\nOTM, and SEM be more common for geological purposes, they use in soil studies can reveal \n\ngreat information, especially at ornithogenic soils. The present study was carried out at Lions \n\nRump where six pedons were selected to represent the main soil types commonly found in \n\nice-free areas of King Georg Island, varying from soils devoid vegetation cover to \n\nornithogenic soils, all of them with high organic carbon contents. Each pedon was described \n\nand sampled for micromorphological and microchemical studies, clay mineralogical \n\nevaluation, and chemistry and physical analyses. Results showed that phosphatization is the \n\nmain process of soil formation in ornithogenic soils, where we can observe phosphatic \n\ncompounds filling soil porous, covering clasts and reacting with minerals forming mainly \n\nnon-crystalline phosphates. The processes of ornithogenesis depend on time of exposure to \n\nbirds influence and the amount of guano depositions on the soil. Due to this characteristic, we \n\ncould separated  the ornithogenic soils in two groups: Acid pH ornithogenic soils and Neutral \n\npH ornithogenic soils whereas in the first one the phosphatization was more intense. \n\n \n\nWords key: ornithogenic soils, phosphatization, WDS analyses  \n\n\n\n50 \n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nPedological studies of polar regions, especially in the Antarctica Continental, are one \n\nof the key issues on the environmental reconstruction of terrestrial landscapes, and can help \n\nmonitoring climate changes. \n\nAlthough physical weathering is undoubtless a major soil forming process in Maritime \n\nAntarctica, chemical weathering also occurs, notably in acid sulphate and ornithogenic soils \n\n(Michel et al., 2006; Simas et al., 2006). For some ornithogenic soils after these both \n\nweathering process non-crystalline phases are important soil components and represent over \n\n75% of the clay fraction (Simas et al., 2006). The ample variation of phosphate minerals in \n\nthe ornithogenic soils of King George Island is probably due to singular environmental \n\nconditions, such as relatively high precipitation; low temperature; specific chemical \n\ncomposition of penguin excreta (especially a high fluorine content); soil water composition \n\nchanges, as a result of periodical nesting of the penguins on the land, and the lack wide \n\nvariety of plants and humus material derived from them (Tatur and Barczuk, 1985). \n\nIn Ornithogenic soils, the phosphatization is the main pedogenic process that causes \n\nacidity and weathering. P-rich solutions penetrate the frost-induced fractures in the clasts and \n\nreact with mineral soils to form amorphous and crystalline P compounds  \n\n(Schaefer et al., 2008).  \n\nOrnithogenic sites are extremely important and constitute the most important locci of \n\nC sequestration in Antarctica terrestrial ecosystems (Simas et. al, 2007). Although biomass \n\nproduction by the Antarctica vegetation is relatively low, it frequently exceeds the \n\ndecomposition capacity of local microbiota (Ugolini, 1972). Therefore, organic matter \n\naccumulates at some sites and plays important pedological and ecological roles (Beyer et al., \n\n1995; Beyer, 2000; B\u00f6lter and Kandeler, 2004). \n\nScarse information is available about micromorphology of permafrost-affected soils \n\nfrom Maritime Antarctica, the wettest and warmest part of Antarctica (Schaefer et al., 2008), \n\ncompared with Arctic soils. Besides the few use for soil scientists, micromorphological and \n\nmicrochemical studies can reveal important information regarding soil genesis and \n\nphysicochemical characteristics and relevant data for planning and definition conservation \n\nstrategies for Antarctic environments.  \n\nThe objective of this paper was to study soil clay fraction and describe and analyze the \n\nmost important microscopic features of typical cryogenic soils, especially ornithogenic soils, \n\nfrom Lions Rump, King George Bay, Maritime Antarctica. \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS \n\nStudy area \n\nLions Rump is a small peninsula located on the southern coast of King George Bay, \n\nKing George Island, in the South Shetlands Archipelago, Maritime Antarctica (Figure 1). The \n\nstudy area is defined as terrestrial land within following coordinates: 62\u00b007\u201948\u2019\u2019S, \n\n58\u00b009\u201917\u2019\u2019W; 62\u00b007\u201949\u2019\u2019S, 58\u00b007\u201914\u2019\u2019W; 62\u00b008\u201919\u2019\u2019S, 58\u00b007\u201919\u2019\u2019W; and 62\u00b008\u201916\u2019\u2019S, \n\n58\u00b009\u201915\u2019\u2019W (SCAR, 2002). \n\nThe study area was visited in the austral summer of 2009/2010, during Brazilian \n\nAntarctic Expeditions. During field work, 26 pedons representing the main soil types \n\nidentified in ice-free areas of Lions Rump were described and sampled, based on criteria \n\nestablished by Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic Permafrost, Soils and Periglacial Environments \n\nGroup (ANTPAS 2006) and considering geomorphological features.  \n\nFrom 26, six pedons were selected to represent the main soil types commonly found in \n\nice-free areas of Lions Rump (Table 1), varying from soils devoid vegetation cover to \n\nornithogenic soils with relative high organic carbon contents. Each pedon was described and \n\nsampled for micromorphological and microchemical studies, clay mineralogical evaluation, \n\nand chemistry and physical analyses. \n\n \nFigura 1- Location of the studied soils, in Lions Rump peninsulas, King George Island, King \n\nGeorge Bay, Maritime Antarctica.

(lichen); Syntrichia princeps (Bryophyta) and Prasiola crispa (algae). \n\nConsidering field observations and analytic results, soils of Lions Rump were \n\nseparated into three groups: Acid pH ornithogenic soils (LR7, LR8, LR9), Neutral pH \n\nornithogenic soils (LR11, LR15), and Non-ornithogenic soil (LR3).  \n\nThe ahumic soil (LR3) a Turbic Haplogelepts the only profile of the Non-ornithogenic \n\nsoil group was selected for this study to be used as comparison represent a soil without \n\navifauna influence (Figure 2). It was the chosen one due to be very representative for the other \n\nsoils Non-ornithogenic as Cryorthents, Haplogelepts, Gelorthents, Haplorthels, Haploturbels, \n\nGelifluvents and Cryopsamments widespread throughout the area. \n\nIn Lions Rump, LR7, LR8 and LR9 are located on sites developed from andesitic \n\nrocks that gave the name to the peninsula, and possibly represents one of the first ice-free \n\nareas colonized by penguins in Antarctica (Figure 2). Soils of LR7 and LR8 are from \n\nabandoned penguin rookeries covered by exuberant vegetation of Deschampsia, thick O \n\nhorizon and well-developed profile with reddish color indicating advanced weathering status. \n\nSoil LR9 is from a recently abandoned penguin rookeries covered by incipient vegetation, \n\nmostly covered by Prasiola. \n\nLR11 and LR15 are present at areas with more recently exposure to ornithogenic \n\ninfluence, especially at uplifted terrace and Quaternary moraines, respectively (Figure 2). \n\n \n\nChemical, physical and mineralogical analyses \n\nSoil pH, exchangeable nutrients and texture were determined for&lt;2 mm air-dried \n\nsamples according to EMBRAPA (1997). Exchangeable Ca2+, Mg2+ and Al3+ were extracted \n\nwith 1 mol L-1 KCl and P, Na and K with Mehlich-1 solution extractant (0.05 mol L-1 HCl + \n\n0.0125 mol L-1 H2SO4). Elements contents were determined by atomic absorption \n\nspectrometry (Ca, Mg and Al), flame emission spectrometry (K and Na) and colorimetry \n\nmethod (P). H+Al was determined after extraction with 0.5 mol L-1 calcium acetate solution \n\nbuffered at pH 7.0 by titration with 0.0025 mol L- 1 HCl (EMBRAPA, 1997). Organic matter \n\n(OM) was determined on&lt;0.5 mm samples by wet combustion (Yeomans and Bremner, \n\n1988). Soil texture was obtained after dispersion of&lt;2 mm samples in NaOH solution, \n\nsieving of coarse and fine sand, sedimentation of silt and clay fractions with adaptations for \n\nclay dispersion (Ruiz, 2005). \n\n \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 View of selected studied profiles with their location in the landscape \n  \n\nLR11 \n\nLR3 \n\nLR15 \nLR7 \n\nLR9 \n\nLR7 LR8 \n\nLR15 \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\nClay fraction of selected profiles was submitted to selective digestion with boiling \n\nNaOH 5 mol L-1 for 90 min to concentrate and better characterize iron oxides, according \n\nK\u00e4mpf &amp; Schwertmann (1982). \n\nThe X-ray analyses were performed on a X'Pert Pro diffractometer model PW \n\n3040/60, x-ray tube ceramic, solid-state detector X'Celerator, long fine focus, equipped with \n\ncobalt anode, Co-K? radiation (? = 1, 79026 \u00c5), operated with 40 kV and 30 mA. The \n\npowdered clay samples were placed and lightly pressed on the holder, avoiding clay \n\norientation, scanned from 0 to 50 o2? with 0.05 o2? increments and 2 seconds of counting \ntime in each step. \n\n \n\nMicromorphology and microchemical studies \n\nUndisturbed soil samples (5 \u00d7 10 cm) from some selected soil horizons were sampled \n\nin field and transport to the laboratory, where were impregnated with 1:1 crystic resin:stiren \n\nmix poured at atmospheric pressure and temperature. Impregnated samples were cut into slabs \n\nof 0.5 cm thickness using a diamond saw, and polished with corundum abrasives from 250 to \n\n600 mesh. After ultrasonic cleaning, the polished blocks were mounted onto glass slides \n\nfollowed by polishing and hand-finishing to produce 30 nm thick sections. All procedures \n\nwere carried according to Schaefer et al. (2008). The description of the microstructure was \n\nmade using a HITACHI S-3400N scanning electron microscope with a Thermo Noran EDS \n\nspectrometer equipped with SYSTEM SIX. Quantitative electron probe microanalysis by \n\nwavelength dispersive spectrometry was performed with a 5 spectrometer Cameca SX51 \n\nelectron probe in Geoscience Department of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA. \n\nSamples and standards were carbon coated with ~200 \u00c5 carbon. Operating conditions were 15 \n\nkV accelerating voltage with a (Faraday cup) beam current of 4 nA. Natural and synthetic \n\nmineral standards were used background positions. Automation and matrix corrections were \n\nperformed with probe for EPMA software (Donovan et al, 2010; Armstrong, 1995). \n\nPedological features of the soil horizons at OTM level were analysed using standard \n\nmicromorphological techniques (Bullock et al., 1985). \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nChemical, physical and mineralogical properties \n\nSoils from Lions Rump were formed by the weathering of basalt-andesitic rocks and \n\npresent apatite as mineral accessory providing phosphorus and exchangeable bases as \n\nindicated by non-ornithogenic soils, which do not have avifauna influence, but present high \n\ncontents of Ca, Mg, K and P (Table 2).  \n\nThe soils from penguin rookeries and adjacent areas (LR7, LR8, LR9, LR11 and \n\nLR15) are more developed than soil with no fauna influence (LR3). Stony/pebbly pavements \n\nare present in all sites but are often hidden by the well-developed and continuous vegetation. \n\nClear horizon differentiation occurs and a relatively deep organic matter-rich A horizons and \n\nphosphatic B horizons were easily identified. Surface horizons are dark and yellowish brown \n\nas a result of humus incorporation similar to other ornithogenic soils described by Simas et al. \n\n(2007) and Michel et al. (2006) in other areas from King George Island. \n\nThe content of fine particles no differs between soil groups (Table 2). As weathering \n\nprocesses are different, in essence, and intensity, this similarity can be associated to genesis \n\nfrom different source materials. It was expected that soils more pedogenetic develop (Acid pH \n\nornithogenic) had higher content of fine particles, but  LR7, LR8 and LR9 profiles are \n\nderivated from basaltic bedrock, whilst LR11 and LR15 are former under moraine compound \n\nby mixed materials, especially basaltic-andesitic with advanced materials fragmentation, and \n\nLR3 are formed from basaltic-andesitic materials covering a plateau. \n\nAll ornithogenic soils have much more TOC contents than the non-ornithogenic one \n\n(LR3), a clear evidence of the avifauna contribution to C pool. Among ornithogenic soil, sites \n\ndominated by D. antarctica and C. quitensis (LR7, LR8, LR11 and LR15) presented more \n\nTOC contents  in depth horizons, because lignine-bearing tissues and root systems presence. \n\nAcid pH ornithogenic soils (LR7, LR8, and LR9) are easily distinguished from the \n\nnon-ornithogenic soil (LR3) by several features, such as presence on the field of continuous \n\nvegetation cover with D. antarctica, C. quitensis and/or Prasiola crispa; and also for lower \n\npH and bases saturation; high OM contents, Melich-1 extractable-P, and exchangeable Al \n\n(Table 2). Chemical characteristics of ornithogenic soils are strongly affected by sea-land \n\ntransfers by birds, mostly penguins, through deposition of large amounts of guano during \n\naustral summer. In these soils, a particular and complex process of deep soil \n\n\u201cphosphatization\u201d occurs, which has been described in details by Tatur and Barczuk (1985), \n\nTatur (1989), Schaefer et al. (2004), and Simas et al.

(2007). \n\nNeutral pH ornithogenic soils (LR11 and LR16) no present these standards \n\nornithogenic characteristics described before, taking place from parental material rich in \n\nexchangeable bases at low altitude and close to the sea. These high contents of bases, \n\nincluding Na, promotes a buffering effect on the soil profile, reducing acidity, and \n\nconsequently, reducing mineral weathering and leaching of nutrients. Soils with high content \n\nof bases, high buffer potential, which remains proximity to neutral pH, disfavor phosphate \n\nminerals crystallization, like as observed in soils LR11 and LR15 (Figure 6). Despite high \n\nlevels of P extract with Melich-1 and morphological features (Table 3), both characteristics of \n\nornithogenic soils, these soils do not contain crystalline phosphates minerals; therefore, we \n\ncan expect phosphate minerals similar to amorphous forms. Maybe all phosphates are \n\nremoved from soil solution by, and no enough excess is present in solution to form crystalline \n\nphosphates minerals (Figure 6).  \n\nThe principal difference between acid and neutral ornithogenic soils is the time of soil \n\nexposure to avifauna influence, and the amount of bird excrement accumulated. \n\nAccording to Tatur and Barczuk (1985), \u201cphosphatization\u201d comprises chemical \n\nweathering of rock minerals and formation of amorphous Al and Fe minerals. These phases \n\nreact with ornithogenic P, K and N to form amorphous and crystalline secondary phosphates. \n\nSimas et al. (2006) found crystalline phosphates occurring only in soils directly affected by \n\npenguins (active and abandoned rookeries). The incongruent dissolution of crystalline Al\u2013Fe \n\nphosphates with formation of amorphous P-rich phases is considered the most common \n\ntransformation with the increasing age of site abandonment (Tatur et al., 1997) and maintains \n\nhigh levels of labile P forms.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n59 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nF\nigu\n\nre \n3 \n\n- \nX\n\n-ray \ndiffraction \n\nfrom\n \n\nclay \nfractions \n\nfrom\n \n\nL\nions \n\nR\num\n\np\n \n\nso\nils \n\nprofiles \n(C\n\nr: \nC\n\nristobalite; L\ne: L\n\neucop\nhosphite; M\n\ni: M\nin\n\nyulite; M\nt: M\n\nontm\norillonite group;  \n\nP\ng: P\n\nlagioclase (F\neldspar group\n\n);  Q\nz: Q\n\nuartz; T\na: T\n\naran\nakite; V\n\ne: verm\niculite). \n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n0\n10\n\n20\n30\n\n40\n50\n\n0\n\n1000\n\nP\n3\n A\n\nPg (3.20)\n\nPg (3.62)\n\nPg (4.04)\n\nMt (5.05)\n\nMt, Ve (15.13)\n\nMt (4.47)\n\nVe (7.15)\n\nQz, Feld (3.34)\n\nPg, Feld (3.75)\n\nMt (3.03)\n\nMt (2.52)\n\n Ve (2.38)\n\nP\n3\n B\n\ni\n\n2?\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n0\n10\n\n20\n30\n\n40\n50\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\n1100\n\n1200\n\n1300\n\nP\n7\n A\n\n(9.06)\n\nPg (2.66)\n\nQz (2.14)\n\nCr (2.84)\n\nMt (2.52)\n\nPg (2.94)\n\nCr (3.14) Pg (3.19)\nPg (3.21)\n\nQz, Feld (3.35)\n\nPg (3.65)\nFeld (3.77)\n\nPg, Cr (4.05)\nQz(4.27)\n\nMt (4.51)\n\nP\n7\n B\n\ni\n\nMt (15.98)\n\n(2.34)\n\n2?\n\n0\n10\n\n20\n30\n\n40\n50\n\nTa, Qz (2.28)\n\nTa (2.40)\n\nPg, Ta (2.63)\n\nTa (2.82)\n\nTa(2.84)\n\nPg, Ta(3.18)\nPg(3.21)\n\nQz, Ta(3.35)\n\nTa (3.76)\n\nMt (4.50)\n\nMt (5.03)\n\n(5.92)\n\nTa(7.20)\nTa (7.47)\n\nTa (7.99)\n\nTa, Mt (16.00)\n\nPg (4.35)\nPg (4.05)\n\n(3.83)\n\nTa (3.60)\n\nTa (3.15)\n\n(3.47)\n\nPg,Ta(2.95)\n\nMt (2.53)\n\nTa (2.13)P\n8\n B\n\nA\n\n2 ?\nP\n\n8\n B\n\n3\n\n0\n1\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n3\n0\n\n4\n0\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n4\n0\n0\n\n6\n0\n0\n\n8\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n2\n0\n0\n\nTa(5.04)\n\nTa(2.12)\n\nTa(2.26)\n\nTa(2.39)\n\n(4.03)\n\nTa(2.57)\nTa(2.63)\n\nTa(2.73)\nTa, Le(2.82)\n\n(3.97)\nLe (3.03)\n\nPg (3.21)\nTa (3.14)\n\nFeld, Mi, Le (3.34)\nTa(3.58)\n\nTa (3.76)Ta (3.81)\n\nFeld (4.22)\nTa(4.31)\n\nLe(4.70)\n\nMi (5.51)\nLe(5.95)\nLe (6.74)\n\nTa(7.46)\nTa(7.90)\n\nTa(15.89)\n\nP\n9\n C\n\nr\n\n2?\n\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n4\n0\n0\n\n6\n0\n0\n\n8\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n2\n0\n00\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n4\n0\n0\n\n6\n0\n0\n\n8\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n2\n0\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n3\n0\n\n4\n0\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n4\n0\n0\n\n6\n0\n0\n\n8\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n2\n0\n0\n\nMt (5.21)\n\nQz (4.26)\n\nMt (4.60)\n\nQz (2.14)\n\nCr (2.84)\n\nMt (2.52)\n\nPg (2.95)\n(3.00)\n\n(3.43)\n\nPg (3.65)\n\nP\n1\n1\n 2\n\nA\nB\n\nMt (15.53)\n\nPg, Cr (4.05)\n\nFeld (3.77)\n\nQz, Feld (3.35)\n\nCr (3.14)\nPg (3.22)\n\nP\n1\n1\n 2\n\nB\ni\n\n2 ?\nP\n\n1\n1\n 2\n\nB\ni2\n\n \n\n0\n10\n\n20\n30\n\n40\n50 P\n\n1\n5\n A\n\nPg (2.65)\n\nMt (3.00)\n\n(3.42)\nPg (3.64)\n\nQz (4.25)\n\nMt (4.53)\n\nP\n1\n5\n B\n\ni\n\nMt (15.45)\n\nPg (4.05)\n\nFeld (3.77)\n\nQz, Feld (3.35)\nPg (3.21)\n\nPg (3.18)\n\nPg (2.94)\n\nMt (2.52)\n\nMt (2.34)\n\nQz (2.13)\n\n2?\n\n\n\n60 \n \n\nThe formation of crystalline phosphate minerals are found exclusively in the upper soil \n\nlayers (LR8 and LR9), more humid than deeper horizons, which receives directly the \n\ncontribution coming from bird's organic excreta, although high content of P is found in the \n\nwhole profile. \n\nAll ornithogenic soils from Lions Rump presented high contents of P in deeper layers, \n\nwhich indicate high P translocation in soils with high cation exchange capacity (CEC), and \n\nthat not all P-rich subsurface horizons are buried horizons like some profiles found by Michel \n\net al. (2006), at Copacabana, Admiralty Bay. Similar results observed in Lions Rump were \n\nfound by Schaefer et al. (2008), Simas et al. (2007), Myrcha and Tatur (1991).  \n\nIn the ornithogenic soils, X-ray diffractions showed clearly \u201cphosphatization\u201d of the \n\nprofile, especially for LR8 and LR9. Despite Tatur and Keck (1990) had verified high range \n\nof phosphate minerals in Maritime Antarctic soils, the major minerals identified in Lions \n\nRump were taranakite (mainly), leucophosphite and minyulite (Figure 3). Similarly, Simas et \n\nal. (2006) also found few minerals in soils from Admiralty Bay, basically metavariscite, \n\nleucophosphite and minyulite. Besides the high variety of mineral phosphates found at \n\nMaritime Antarctic as described by Tatur and Keck (1990) and Barczuk and Tatur (2003), \n\nmost part of them were found just in some specific sites in others Maritime Antarctica areas. \n\nLeucophosphite formation appears is related to guano and silicate minerals interaction \n\n(Wilson and Bain, 1976), conditions verified in Lions Rump. DRX peaks of these minerals at \n\nLR9 confirm this indication, and peaks were similar to that observed by Wilson and Bain \n\n(1976) and Tatur and Barczuk (1985) at Elephant Island and King George Island, \n\nrespectively. According to Myrcha and Tatur (1991), minyulite occurrence is typical in the \n\nupper and middle portions of phosphatized zone, where Fe is entirely leached from the soil by \n\nstrong action of guano solutions, which simultaneously supplied also high quantities of \n\nfluorine. These conditions are present in ornithogenic areas of Lions Rump, especially at LR9 \n\n(Figure 3). \n\nTaranakite occurrence is typical for deep and acid soils, under a wet regime (Myrcha \n\nand Tatur, 1991). DRX peaks of taranakite are observed in Acid pH ornithogenic soils, with \n\nan exception for LR7. For this profile, although peaks are not identified, similar elementar \n\nconcentration that suggests taranakite presence is determined by EDS analysis (Table 3), \n\nindicating this phosphate mineral presence, but maybe in not well crystallinyzed form. \n\nIn the absence of ornithogenic activity, soil chemical weathering in Antarctic is less \n\npronounced and soils present chemical and mineralogical characteristics greatly influenced by \n\nthe parent material (Simas et al., 2004, 2007; Schaefer et. al., 2008; Michel et al., 2006). For \n\n\n\n61 \n \n\nLions Rump soils without avifauna influence, weathering of parent material promote soil \n\nformation with high pH, salinity and Ca2+ and Mg2+ contents, as can be exemplified by LR3 \n\n(Table 2).  \n\nOn the other hand, high guano inputs generate an acid environment, which becomes \n\nprogressively less acid with soil development, following rookery abandonment. Guano is \n\ninitially alkaline, but microbial degradation generates acidity. However, when sites are \n\nabandoned and no fresh guano further input is observed, mineral weathering and high \n\namounts of OM can neutralize part of the acidity, resulting in a more buffered soil (Michel et \n\nal. 2006). However, in Lions Rump this expect was not confirmed for LR7 and LR8 profiles, \n\nprobably due to high inclination of these sites, which can favor superficial guano erosion \n\navoiding and/or reducing bases accumulation and the buffering effect. In Lions Rump, even \n\nthe more evolved soils (LR7 and LR8) still have lower pH values due to the advanced stage of \n\nweathering in comparison other ones, transforming 2:1 clay silicates into phosphates. LR7 has \n\nreddish-brown color (5YR 5/3) at horizon B, what can indicate the more action of \n\npedogenesis of this soil in comparison to others, what probably due to crystalline phosphates \n\nweathering remains only amorphous form of P and hematite.  \n\nXRD patterns of LR15 sample, a \u201cneutral pH ornithogenic soil\u201d (Figure 3), indicate no \n\nmineralogy alteration after short avifauna influence, therefore, despite the high amount of P \n\nand TOC input by birds, short soil exposure to the penguin rookery was not enough to \n\npromote phospatization process, which is a transformation of silicate clay minerals into \n\nphosphates. \n\nPhosphatization process is evident in LR8 profile (Figure 3), which all silicate clay \n\nminerals were transformed into crystalline and non-crystalline phosphates, mainly Taranakite. \n\nThe main evidence for this is the complete absence of 1:1 secondary silicate clay minerals, as \n\nalso observed in the most part of ornithogenic soils. Weathering process transforming primary \n\nsilicate minerals into 2:1 and after into 1:1 minerals is not common for Antarctica \n\nornithogenic soils (Figure 3, P7 and P8). When primary minerals are weathered, bases in \n\nsolution are complexed by phosphate in solution reducing bases activity to contents not \n\nenough to form secondary aluminium silicates minerals. \n\nObserving DRX results from clay fraction previously submitted to selective digestion \n\nwith boiling NaOH 5 mol L-1 (Figure 4), we noted this procedure to concentrate iron oxides \n\nworks better for well evolved tropical soils with clay fraction dominated by oxides and 1:1 \n\nclay silicates. For incipient soils, this procedure can not remove primary minerals and 2:1 \n\nsilicates, and DRX show for all soils peaks of quartz, and minerals from feldspar and \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\nmontmorillonite groups. Hematites are found at Acid ornithogenic soils because are more \n\ndevelopment soils and at LR3. Magnetite was detected in LR3, LR7 and LR8, confirming \n\nindicious previous indicate by magnet use. Presence of magnetite and as well anatase is \n\nexpected because this soil is originated from basalt (Figure 4). Goethite, Maghemite and \n\nothers iron oxides are not detected. \n\n \n\nMicromorphology  \n\nSoil matrix of Lions Rump profiles are composed mostly for mineral from weathering \n\nof igneous rocks. Soil structure is formed mainly by secondary minerals such as 2:1 minerals \n\nlike vermiculite and montmorillonite (Figure 3) with presence of Si-rich fractured clasts \n\nmainly plagioclases with Fe oxides as accessory minerals (Figures 4 and 5). Selected samples \n\nof some horizons from ornithogenic soils used for OTM and SEM studies illustrate typical \n\nfeatures for LR3, LR7, LR8 (Figure 5, Table 3), and LR9 and LR11 (Figure 6 and Table 4).  \n\nLR3, a non-ornithogenic soil, little-altered rock fragments and mineral weathering \n\noccur, with dominance amphibolite rich in Mg (Figure 5). Phosphorus is present just inside \n\nstructure of fragments of clasts and aggregates of basaltic and andesitc materials.  \n\nSoil profile LR7 exhibit moderate subangular blocky structure with phosphate material \n\nfilling the voids (Figure 5). Pedon LR8AB presents subangular blocky structure abundant \n\ncoated and filled by phosphate materials, matrix formed by 2:1 and phosphates minerals, with \n\nclasts of plagioclases rich in Na and small and highly fragmented minerals rich in Ca and Mg \n\nuntil 70 cm depth. Downward in the B2 horizon these clasts are larger and less fragmented \n\nwith phosphates material presence only at the edges of minerals in contact with macropores \n\n(Figure 5). In LR9, the P-rich solution penetrates filling voids and around the clast, mainly \n\nplagioclases, forming a framework of phosphatic rims around these materials, with soil matrix \n\nformed preferentially by Al-Fe-K phosphate in crystalline and non-crystalline form (Figure \n\n6). According to Schaefer et al.

Plagioclases are the main phenocryst mineral and vary from fresh and \n\nunaltered to strongly altered and corroded grains. These minerals are normally surrounded by \n\nSi-amorphous with presence of Al and Fe materials, as indicated by the elemental maps and \n\nquantitative EDS analysis (Figure 6, Table 4). Pyroxenes are also common phenocrysts \n\n(Figure 6). Bone fragments are also common at LR11 (Table 4). Besides the great amount of \n\nP exctact by Melich-1, phosphates are not detected in DRX or SEM images at LR11 and \n\nLR15. Although penguins aport great amount of P and N what favor vegetation growth, \n\nmaybe the time of rookery and the number of individuals presents in these penguins colony \n\nare not enough to input high increments of P and form phosphates compounds.  \n\nOTM images and semi-quantitative EDS analysis can help the soil scientists to better \n\nunderstand soil compounds and structure. In our case, microstructure of these typical frost-\n\n\n\n68 \n \n\naffected soils and ornithogenic soils present a particular type of globular, rounded aggregates, \n\nunder strong biological influence. Phosphates phases occur as illuvial coatings, in fillings and \n\nwithin discrete aggregates. In LR7 (Table 3), we can note a clear presence of P compounds \n\nfilling the voids (Id 1) rounding aggregates (Id 2), and covering minerals as plagioclases, \n\nquartz (Id 9) and pyroxenes (Table 3). Most part of illuvial phosphatic features (Id 6 and 7) is \n\nformed by non-crystalline forms of aluminium phosphate with close to 60 % of P. In LR8 the \n\nP-rich solution penetrates into the cracks and cleavage planes and reacts preferentially with \n\nplagioclases, which is the main mineral of the soil matrix (Id 4, 5 and 6, LR8B2, Table 3). We \n\ncan observe phosphates covering the silicates minerals and the weathering process of this \n\nmineral (Id 8, Table 3). At LR 9, the soil matrix is mainly phosphatic, formed by aluminium-\n\niron phosphate non-crystalline involving clasts of Na-plagioclases (LR9, Table 4). In LR11 \n\nsoil, matrix is formed by a mixed of minerals well-rounded and fragmented due to cryoclastic \n\nprocess and transport by the glacier (Table 4). As a residual of avifauna influence on the soil \n\nformation process, a piece of bone can be observed in some profiles (Id 1, LR112Bi, Table 4). \n\nThe dispersive spectrometry (WDS) for LR7 Cr (Table 5) indicate the presence of low \n\ncrystalline aluminion phosphate as the main phosphate mineral filling the voids of this soil \n\nhorizon, what is confirmed by XDR analyses (Figure 3) that no indicates peaks of crystalline \n\nphosphates as taranakite, leucophosphite, minuiylite and others as identified in different areas \n\nof Maritime Antarctica by Tatur and Keck (1990) and Barczuk and Tatur (2003). How already \n\nshowed by Simas et al. (2006) uncrystalinium phosphate are the main component of clay \n\nfraction of ornithogenic soils. Due to the high acidity and leaching probably the crystalline \n\nphosphates are instable in these chemical soil conditions.  \n\nWDS data for LR9 Cr (Table 6) indicate Taranakite (K3Al5(HPO4)6(PO4)2.18(H2O)) as \n\nthe main phosphate mineral filling the space porous of this soil horizon, what is confirmed by \n\nXDR analyses (Figure 3). Results from WDS point analyses are quite homogenous and \n\nrepresenting low deviations of Taranakite chemical composition. However, studies from Tatur \n\n(1989) and Tatur and Keck (1990) with phosphates of Antarctica ornithogenic soils identified \n\nammonium in Taranakite, but no N peaks were detected in this mineral in our samples from \n\nLions Rump. Phosphates phases occur as illuvial coatings, in fillings and within discrete \n\naggregates. In all secondary phases, chemical variably is greater but in general follow \n\ndescrescent content for Fe>K>P>Al, and vary depending on the primary mineral that the \n\nsolution rich in P will react to form phosphates. \n\n  \n\n\n\n69 \n \n\nTable 5 - SEM images and mean WDS chemical analysis of phosphatic plasma in the Bi \nhorizon of profile LR7 \n\n \n\n  \nId Na2O SiO2 Al2O3 MgO K2O P2O5 SO3 CaO Fe2O3 Sum \n ------------------------------------------------------------ % ------------------------------------------------------------ \nMean* 0.0 0.2 21.3&lt;DL 4.3 49.1 0.3 0.1 0.8 75.5 \n\nsd 0.0 0.1 2.0 0.0 0.6 2.6 0.1 0.0 0.5 3.8 \n<DL = below detection limits; sd = standard deviation; * n= 10.  \n \n\n \n\nTable 6 - SEM images and mean WDS chemical analysis of phosphatic plasma in the Cr \nhorizon of profile LR9 \n\n \n\n  \nPoint Na2O SiO2 Al2O3 MgO K2O P2O5 SO3 CaO Fe2O3 H2O Sum \n ------------------------------------------------------------ % ------------------------------------------------------------ \nMean* 0.1 1.0 22.6 0.1 8.3 39.8 0.4 0.1 3.8 17.0 93.0 \n\nsd 0.0 0.4 3.1 0.0 2.4 1.5 0.1 0.1 3.0 3.3 5.1 \n<DL = below detection limits; sd= standard deviation; *n=10.   \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\n1. Ornithogenic soils rich in phosphates in Lions Rump can have or not mineral phosphates \n\nphases, identified by XRD. \n\n2. Phosphates phases occur as illuvial coatings, in fillings and within discrete aggregates. In \n\nall secondary phases, chemical variably is greater for Fe>K>P>Al. \n\n3. The microstructure of this soil is typical of frost-affected soils, and ornithogenic soils \n\npossess a particular type of globular, rounded aggregates, under strong biological \n\ninfluence. \n\n4. Phosphatization is the main process of soil formation in Acid Ornithogenic Soils. \n\n5. The utilization of microchemical techniques proved to be useful for a better understanding \n\nof pedogenesis in these poorly known Antarctic soils. \n\n \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n \n\nAnderson B.

This paper \n\ndescribes the active layer thermal regimes of two shallow boreholes, geographical and \n\naltitudinal adjacent, present the same soil class but have a different vegetation cover. The \n\nboreholes are situated in the Lions Rump area at King George Island, Maritime Antarctic, \n\nregion that represents one of the most sensitive to climate change and is located near the \n\nclimatic limit of permafrost, since mean annual air temperature at sea level is close to -2\u00b0C. \n\nThe limited knowledge about ground temperature conditions led a recent effort to increase \n\nactive layer and permafrost research in the Antarctic. Both study sites are in a Turbic Cambic \n\nCryosol formed by andesitic parent material, one under moss vegetation (85 m a.s.l) and \n\nanother under lichen (86 m a.s.l). Ground temperature series were collected at 1-hour \n\nintervals, recorded during two years, from March 2009 to February 2011. In both boreholes, \n\na network of three soil temperatures sensors were installed at 10, 30 and 80 cm depths, one \n\nmoisture sensor at 80 cm depth, and one air temperature sensor at 100 cm height above soil. \n\nTwo sites showed significant differences in mean annual ground temperature for all depths. \n\nThe lichen site shows higher soil temperature amplitude than lichen site, present in ground \n\nsurface the highest daily temperature in January 2011 (7.34 \u00b0C) and a lowest daily \n\ntemperature in August (- 16.54 \u00b0C). The soil temperature at lichen site followed variability \n\nof air temperate. The Moss site shows higher water content at bottommost monitored layer \n\nbecause is located at water track position on the landscape. The buffer effect on Moss site \n\nhappens because of the high content of water available associated with the moss vegetation \n\nand snow cover. The active layer in both sites of Lions Rump is thick and both boreholes did \n\nnot reach the permafrost table, but still above 2 m depth what characterized Gelisol/Cryosol. \n\n  \n\n\n\n75 \n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nUnderstand distribution and properties of Antarctic permafrost is essential for the \n\ncryospheric sciences, but also for life sciences, since it will be a major control on ecosystem \n\nmodification following climate-induce changes (Vieira et al. 2010). \n\nPermafrost-affected soils normally present an active layer, which is defined as the \n\nportion of soil which experiences seasonal thawing and freezing (Brown et al., 2000). It is \n\nthrough this layer that, in response to a thermal gradient; heat flows between the atmosphere \n\nand permafrost. Permafrost, defined as any subsurface earth materials remaining below 0\u00b0C \n\nfor more than two years, may be affected profoundly by global warming (Hinkel et. al., 2001). \n\nClimate is a first-order control on permafrost temperatures with local microclimate \n\nalso substantially affecting ground surface temperatures, and therefore, the thermal regime of \n\nthe permafrost. At a local scale, ground surface and permafrost temperatures are affected by \n\nthe characteristics of the snowpack, the type and height of vegetation, moisture content in the \n\nground, topography, the geothermal flux, and the thermal conductivity of the earth materials \n\n(Judge, 1973). Permafrost and vegetation are key environmental components and both are \n\nsensitive to climate change (Guglielmin et al., 2008), particularly where the permafrost it has \n\na discontinuous distribution (Burgess et al., 2000) what occur in Maritime Antarctica. \n\nPeriglacial regions are highly sensitive to climate change. Maritime Antarctica has \n\nbeen increasingly recognized as a key region for monitoring climate change (Cannone et al., \n\n2006; Vieira et al., 2010). The limited knowledge of the ground temperature conditions led a \n\nrecent effort to increase active layer and permafrost research in the Antarctic.  \n\nThe continued monitoring of soil temperature in polar regions allows the identification \n\nof important variables, such as the duration and intensity of the thawing and freezing periods \n\n(Michel et al., 2012). Specific investigations focusing on the relationships between vegetation \n\nand permafrost as a sensitive indicator of climate change are still lacking (Cannone et al., \n\n2006).  \n\nThe aim of this paper is elucidated the influence of vegetation cover on hydrothermal \n\nsoil behavior and describes the active layer thermal regime of two shallow boreholes of a \n\nTurbic Cambic Cryosol located at 85 m.a.s.l, under two contrasting vegetation types located \n\nfive meters apart: a moss carpet (Andrea gainii) site and a Lichen community site. \n\n  \n\n\n\n76 \n \n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n2.1. Regional characteristics \n\nThe study sites are located at Lions Rump peninsula in King George Island, King \n\nGeorge Bay, Maritime Antarctica (Figure 1). The both sites are located in a soil classified as \n\nTurbic Cambic Cryosol (Eutric, Skeletic), according to the WRB system (ISSS, 1998) (Table \n\n1), which correspond to loamy-skeletal, mixed, subgelic, Typic Haplorthels and sandy-\n\nskeletal, mixed, active, subgelic, according to the Soil Taxonomy (SSSA, 2003). Both sites is \n\nin the same altitude, have a loamy-sand texture (Table 2) and are different only in landscape \n\nposition and vegetation cover: the moss carpet (mainly formed by Andrea gainii) site in the \n\nlower landscape position (water track), and the Lichen community site, dominated by Usnea \n\nantarctic and Ochrolechia frigida and located in a small terrain undulation (inter-area track). \n\nVegetation cover more than 70 % of the soil surface at both sites (Figure 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.

Mean \n\nannual precipitation is proximally to 400 mm (Simas et al., 2007), but the real soil water \n\nregime is highly influenced by its position in the landscape, due to the intense melting of \n\nsnow, glaciers and permafrost sites upstream during the summer. The temperature remains \n\nabove freezing almost all summer (November to March) allowing the vigorous growth of \n\nplant communities, mainly mosses, lichens and algae (Schaefer et al., 2004). \n\nResults from International Polar Year (IPY) permafrost temperature monitoring shows \n\nSouth Shetland Islands with permafrost temperatures slightly below 0\u00b0C at low elevations, \n\nwith values decreasing to about -1.8\u00b0C at 270 m.a.s.l. and 25 m depth. The lowest coastal \n\nterrain near sea level is essentially permafrost free (Vieira et al., 2010). \n\nIn general soils from Lions Rump present incipient and poorly evolved when classified \n\nby WRB and Soil Taxonomy. In the study area, we found Ornithogenic Soils, mainly \n\nCryosols/Gelisols at highest landscape portions, and Cambisol/Inceptsol and (Regosols, \n\nArenosols, Leptsols)/Entsols widespread in the lowland area. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2. Methods \n\nIn summer of 2009, boreholes were dug and the active layer monitoring sites were \n\ninstalled in both sites. Monitoring systems were formed by thermistors (TYPE E, CHROMEL \n\nCONSTANT TERMOCOUPLE, accuracy of \u00b10.2 \u00b0C) arranged in a vertical array at different \n\ndepths (Table 3); soil moisture probes (CS616 WATER CONTENT REFLECTOMETER, \n\naccuracy of \u00b12.5%) placed at the bottommost layer at each site (80 cm deep in both \n\nboreholes) to determine the volumetric water content; and air temperature sensor (107 \n\nTEMPERATURE PROBE) installed at 100 cm above the soil surface. All probes were \n\nconnected to a Campbell Scientific CR 1000 data logger that recorded data at hourly intervals \n\nfrom April, 2009 to January, 2011. \n\nThe characteristics of the monitored sites are presented in Table 1. Temperature soil \n\nprobes are installed in the same deep for both sites (10, 30 and 80 cm). The depth of the \n\nprobes was established respecting pedological differentiation of horizons.  \n\nMultivariable regression was performed in order to describe soil temperature at 80 cm \n\nfrom temperatures of two first layers and air temperature, using Statistica\u00ae software (Statsoft, \n\n\n\n79 \n \n\n2009). To try predict soil temperature from superficial sensors in Antartica conditions is so \n\ninteresting for future studies that can not reach depth layers. \n\nWe calculated the thawing days (days in which all hourly measurements are positive \n\nand at least one reading is warmer than +0.5 \u00b0C), and freezing days (days in which all hourly \n\nmeasurements are negative and at least one reading is colder than ?0.5 \u00b0C); the number of \n\nisothermal days (days in which all the hourly measurements range only between \u00b10.5 \u00b0C); the \n\nnumber of freeze\u2013thaw days (days inwhich there are both negative and positive temperatures \n\nwith at least one value greater than \u00b10.5 \u00b0C); the thawing degree days (obtained by the \n\ncumulative sum of the mean daily temperatures above 0 \u00b0C); the freezing degree days \n\n(obtained by the cumulative sum of the mean daily temperatures below 0 \u00b0C); all according to \n\nGuglielmin et al. (2008).  \n\nTo better assess the influence of the average thickness of the snow, estimate of the \n\nindex N factor (FN) was carried. The index FN relates air temperature with the ground surface \n\nand can be calculated for the seasons' periods of fusion (thawing degree days) or freezing \n\n(freezing degre days) of the soil (Riseborough, 2003). From results from the soil Freezing \n\nDegree Days at 10 cm (FDD) and air (FDDa) was calculated index FN, in this case only for \n\nthe time of freezing, with equation: FN = FDD/FDDa. Soil temperature of 10 cm was selected \n\ndue to be monitored depth closest to the soil surface. Since the temperatures (soil and air) in \n\nsome periods during the year are not simultaneously positive or negative, it is therefore, \n\nnecessary to definer \u201cFN station\" or freezing station (Nieuwendam, 2009). \n\nActive layer thickness was calculated as the 0 \u00b0C depth by extrapolating the thermal \n\ngradient from the two deepest temperature measurements (Guglielmin, 2006). \n\nThe apparent thermal diffusivity was estimated from equation of McGaw et al. (1978): \n\n? = [?Z2 / 2?t] x [(Tij+1- Tij-1) / (Tji-1- 2Tj1 + Tji+1)], where ? = apparent thermal diffusivity (m2 \n\ns?1), ?t = time increments (s), ?Z = space increments (m), T = temperature, j = temporal \n\nposition and i = depth position. Nelson et al. (1985), Outcalt and Hinkel (1989), Hinkel et al. \n\n(1990, 2001) and Michel et al. (2012) used this parameter to assess resistance to energy flux \n\nin soil profiles. Hourly estimates were made for intermediate depths of both profiles, and \n\nmean values were calculated and plotted for each day (Figure 3C). \n\n  \n\n\n\n80 \n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n \n\nAlthough both sites are similar in terms of latitude, altitude and climatic events, soil \n\nthermal regime was considerably different when comparing the influence of two soil cover \n\n(Figure 3). The contrasting behavior regarding to water content and soil temperature are \n\nattributed to the vegetation cover and location of sites on the landscape. Compare the soil \n\nlocation as an agriculture terrace, the Moss site is situated in the furrow (water track) and the \n\nLichen site is located on the ridge (inter-area track) (Figure 2). These quite differences in \n\nposition promote great diffences in soil hidrotermic regime. \n\n \n\n3.1. Mosses carpet site \n\nThe highest soil temperature at this site was 12.08 \u00b0C (Table 3), not registered for the \n\ntop soil layer but at 30 cm deep in January 20th 2010 at 2:00 PM, while highest mean daily air \n\ntemperature was 11.07 \u00b0C recorded on January 3rd 2011 at 4:00 PM. Soil water content \n\nranged from approximately 0.60 m3 m-3% in summer to 0.30 %m3 m-3 in winter (Figure 3A). \n\nThe presence of water in the freezing and frozen active layer and near the permafrost table \n\nprotects the ground from rapid cooling and creates a strong thermal gradient (Romanovsky \n\nand Osterkamp, 2000) due to the water high latent heat. \n\nMean annual temperatures of ?0.53 \u00b0C, ?0.51 \u00b0C and ?0.56 \u00b0C were found for the \n\nincreasing depths (10 cm, 30 cm and 80 cm, respectively). The maximum and minimum \n\ntemperatures (hourly records) for the bottommost layer (depth of 80 cm) were 7.15 \u00b0C and \n\n?4.79 \u00b0C, respectively (Table 3). This high temperature (7.15 \u00b0C) in depth favors active layer \n\nand our data show Lions Rump with a deeper active layer of King George Island for this \n\naltitude until now studied. Positive monthly mean temperatures at 80 cm occurred from \n\nJanuary until April 2010, and started early in the next spring, at November 2010. A chill \n\noccurs in midsummer in February slowing the soil warming (Tables 3 and 4).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n81 \n \n\nTable 3.

Although frequent daily freeze and \n\nthaw cycles were observed, the active layer remains predominantly unfrozen until the end of \n\nMarch 2009, when the temperature decreases close to 0.0 \u00b0C, coinciding with beginning of \n\nthermal autumn (Figure 3C), when occurs the so-called zero curtain regime (Hinkel et al., \n\n2001), that keeps the temperature close to 0.0 \u00b0C until the upper layer is complely frozen at \n\nthe end of May. The zero curtain regime refers to a period in autumn when the active layer is \n\nrefreezing from the top-down and from the bottom up. Penetration of the freezing fronts is \n\ninhibited by the release of the latent heat of fusion, and thermal fluctuations occurring on the \n\nsurface are strongly attenuated at shallow depths. Upon completion of the phase change, the \n\ncontinual removal of heat results in a temperature reduction (Hinkel et al. 2001). In the next \n\nyear, 2010, the active layer remains predominantly unfrozen until April 17th 2010, when the \n\ntemperature decreases again close to 0.0 \u00b0C, and over again coinciding with beginning of the \n\nthermal autumn andzero curtain regime that extends until June 5th 2010. After this time, \n\ntemperature decrease and upper soil layer frozen, with complete freezing until 80 cm depth at \n\nthe end of June. During thermal autumn, the freezing front did not reach the complete active \n\nlayer depth. Only after June 23rd, soil presents consistent negative temperatures at the 80 cm \n\ndepth, indicating complete freezing of the active layer. Further cooling occurred during the \n\nwinter season, with soil temperatures decreasing to a minimum of ?6.47 \u00b0C at 10 cm and \n\n?4.79 \u00b0C at 80 cm depth.  \n\nSpring's thermal regime starts at end of September, with soil temperature rising \n\nrapidly, especially for the top soil layer, starting at ?4.1 \u00b0C on August 21st and reaching 0 \u00b0C \n\non October 26th. Differently from the freezing during autumn which shows a delay between \n\nthe top and bottommost layers, the thawing phenomenon practically occurred simultaneously \n\nin whole active layer. During all year, the temperature amplitude between the top and \n\nbottommost sensor was low, reaching a maximum positive of 7.7 \u00b0C on December 9th 2009 \n\nand negative  \n\n\n\n84 \n \n\nTable 4.

In periods as ends of March and June (autumn) and October \n\n(middle spring) are the time of minor thermal amplitude with temperature in whole active \n\nlayer close to 0 \u00b0C, where the curtain regime happens. \n\nThe water content is highly variable ranging from around 0.13 m3 m-3 in the winter to \n\n50 m3 m-3 in the summer (Figure 3A). These high contents of soil water can be explained \n\nbecause the site is located in the water trap, where the meltdown of snow and thawing of \n\nactive layer supply water to this soil portion. The water content follows the zero curtain \n\nregime, which means that just when the soil reaches temperatures above liquefaction the \n\nwater content increases quickly (Figure 3A). The same occurs when the soil starts to freezing, \n\ni.e., the water content just decreases when soil temperature goes below the freezing point. \n\n\n\n85 \n \n\nThe soil thermal regime provides useful data to evaluate the physical state of soil \n\nmoisture and, traditionally, simple approaches have been adopted providing proxy measures \n\nat the phase state of soil moisture (Guglielmin et al., 2008). Among these, the \u201cisothermal \n\ndays\u201d indicate that the energy in the ground is consumed to change the water phase both \n\nduring thawing and freezing, when latent heat exchange produces the \u201czero curtain effect\u201d \n\n(Outcalt et al., 1990). In a similar way, the \u201cfrozen days\u201d and the \u201cthawed days\u201d indicate \n\nwhen the soil moisture is frozen or in a liquid state. Moreover, the \u201cfreeze\u2013thaw days\u201d \n\ndescribe days in which freeze\u2013thaw cycles may occur (Guglielmin et al., 2008). \n\nThe thawing days varied from 104 days at 10 cm of depth to 123 at the deeper layers \n\n(Table 4), and did not vary much between layers studied. The thawing days are concentrated \n\nin summer and begging autumn. Tendency of isothermal days was to increase in depths, \n\nreaching 188 days at 80 cm, what was expected because permafrost and the higher water soil \n\ncontent are close, promoting the thermal buffer effect (Table 5). At the depth of 10 cm, two \n\nfreeze\u2013thaw days occurred whilst the others depths only happen one freeze\u2013thaw day. \n\nThawing and freezing cumulative degree days provide an estimate of the net energy flux in \n\nthe studied sites. Comparison of the 10 cm thawing degree days (236 degree days) and \n\nfreezing degree days (?435 degree days) indicated predominantly freezing conditions (Table \n\n6). At the bottom of the profile, the thawing degree days totalized 191 degree days, while \n\nfreezing degree days totalized ?516 degree days, during the monitoring time between March \n\n2009 until January 2011, but only on a period than one year from December 2009 (summer) \n\nto November 2010 (spring) thawing degree days presented 123 degree days, while freezing \n\ndegree days presented ?224 degree days. Therefore, for this soil freezing conditions are \n\nalmost twice than thawing conditions during the four seasons during the year (Table 6). \n\nSummer's thawing is also affected by this buffering effect at the same depth, but with less \n\nintensity, possibly due to high amounts of ground ice accumulating over the permafrost table \n\n(Michel et al., 2012). \n\nThermal diffusivity was estimated for intermediate depth (30 cm) for each hour, \n\nalthough in Figure 3C is reported as daily mean value. Since it was calculated from the \n\nobserved temperatures, and includes the thermal impact of nonconductive heat transfer, it is \n\nmore properly referred as the apparent thermal diffusivity (ATD) (Hinkel et al. 2001). Mean \n\nATD for a period counted just one year-round from December 2009 (summer) to November \n\n2010 (spring) was -4.6\u00d7310?06 m2 s?1. Negative ATD values indicate that nonconductive \n\neffects oppose and overwhelm the conductive trend (Outcalt and Hinkel, 1989) due to the \n\nhigher water content, especially at summer time.   \n\n\n\n86 \n \n\nTable 5.

Due to the site location (water-track) is highly susceptible \n\nto moisture variations during summer and spring time. \n\nThe ATD values are low and positive during late autumn. Cooler autumn temperatures \n\nresult in a near-isothermal condition of the soil with little heat transport and almost no \n\nvariability of ATD (Hinkel et al., 2012). The dense carpet formed by moss vegetation work \n\nwell as an isolator during the late autumn and snow during the winter, preventing energy flux, \n\nso the mean ATD during winter (21 June to 23 September) was positive at 30 cm (1.7\u00d710?06 \n\nm2 s?1), but quite lower due to the retarding in heat flux promote by the moss carpet and then \n\nby snow blocking the freezing front. This value of ATD during the winter is similar to that \n\n\n\n88 \n \n\nobserved by Michel et al. (2012) at Fildes Peninsula in a site cover with 50 % of vegetation \n\nby mosses and lichens. \n\n  \n\n3.2. Lichen site \n\nThe highest soil temperature record on Lichen site was 13.66 \u00b0C and occurred on \n\nJanuary 3rd 2011 (Table 3), while the highest mean daily air temperature was 7.34 \u00b0C, at the \n\nsame date. The smoothing and delaying of the profile thermal regime is greatly enhanced with \n\ndepth and the highest temperature did not exceed 1.33 \u00b0C at 80 cm. The water content is \n\nalmost not variable ranging from around 10 % in the winter to 24 % in the summer (Figure \n\n3B); therefore, lower than that found for Moss site. Mean annual temperatures of ?1.13 \u00b0C, \n\n?1.29 \u00b0C and ?1.30 \u00b0C were obtained for the increasing depths respectively at 10 cm, 30 cm, \n\nand 80 cm depth between the begging of summer (December 21st) until late spring (December \n\n20th). Positive temperatures occur at the depth of 80 cm, but the highest registered was 1.33 \n\n\u00b0C and mean monthly temperatures is close to 0.0 \u00b0C, indicating that even during summer it \n\nremained close to freezing. The ALT estimated was 120.22 cm. The soil temperature under \n\nLichen cover followed the variability of air temperature, with the upper layers being more \n\nvariable (Figure 3). Despite the moss site present low temperature amplitude between the top \n\nand bottommost layer, at the lichen site the amplitude higher reaching a maximum positive \n\namplitude of 12.33 \u00b0C on December 26th  2010 and  negative maximum amplitude of -7.30 \u00b0C \n\non July 6th 2010, which coincides with early summer and middle of the winter, respectively. \n\nThis high amplitude is created due to high fluctuation on top layer whereas temperature \n\nfollowed straight the atmosphere climate and the subsurface layer be more buffered because \n\nthe filling porous with air.  \n\nNegative temperatures at the upper layer start in the last week of March 2009 with the \n\nbeginning of the thermal autumn whereas temperatures drop rapidly and remain frozen until \n\nmiddle November (Figure 3b). In 2010, the upper layer starts cooler at the end of March and \n\nstill frozen from the end of October. It is important to know that a long zero curtain regime (> \n\n40 days) happens only in the bottommost layer due to the highest water content and the \n\nproximity to permafrost, so in the last layer cooling process start at late March but frozen just \n\nin mid-May. In upper layers, temperatures change with air temperature, and no buffer effect \n\n(zero curtain regime) is verified in these frozen layers when cooling starts (Figure 3b). \n\nGuglielmin et al. (2008) also observed longer zero curtain regime in the bottommost layer \n\nthan upper ones under Usnea cover in Signy Island. \n\n\n\n89 \n \n\nThe process of energy transfer from atmosphere to the first 10 cm of soil had a delay \n\nof just 10 hours (Figure 3) and was quite effective at deeper layers. Temperature reaches at 10 \n\ncm ?17.22 \u00b0C and -9.05 at 80 cm with a delay of 30 hours.  \n\nThawing started in mid-November in 2009 and late October in 2010 when the upper \n\nlayer presented positive temperatures. The atmosphere heating starts in September and the \n\nsoil temperature in upper layers increase exponentially following the air temperature. Despite \n\nthe rapid thaw in the upper layer, temperature at 80 cm depth remains negative until mid-\n\nDecember, reaching a maximum of 1.33 \u00b0C in February of 2011, which can prove the more \n\nproximity to the permafrost table (120.22 cm). These results are similar to those found by \n\nMichel et al. (2012) in Potter Peninsula who found 0.1 \u00b0C at 90 cm depth and soil position at \n\n70 m.a.s.l. with 60 % of soil cover by lichens. \n\nThe thawing days are concentrated in summer time varying  from 128 days for the \n\ndepth of 10 cm to 44 days at the depth of 80 cm (Table 4), because with lower water content \n\nin soil surface the energy dissipated in change water phase (solid to liquid) is less, so this \n\nlayer got warmed easily.  \n\nFreezing days occur almost during the whole year, except summer, and are higher than \n\nthe lichen site than moss carpet site. The same estimate increase to the deepest layer from 422 \n\ndays in the upper layer to 483 days at 80 cm depth.  \n\nMean ATD for the whole studied period was 3.5\u00d710?6 m2 s?1 for 30 cm depth. Colder \n\nconditions resulted in low ATD variability. Mean ATD obtained in winter (from June 21st to \n\nSeptember 23th) was positive (6.6 \u00d710?6 m2 s?1). In the opposite to data observed for soil \n\ncover by mosses, ATD values of the lichen site present great positive oscillations from May to \n\nJune, negative from August to November and late October to early December, and minor \n\nvariations between March and April. Highest ATD values were observed in late autumn, \n\nwhen soil is dry and still uncovered by snow, so diffusivity of the freezing front is high. When \n\nbegin the winter and soil surface is already covered by snow this transfer of cooling is \n\nreduced. During the winter, soil heat transfer is dominated by conduction when most of the \n\nsoil water has been converted to ice. In the spring time when the snow starts to melt, \n\ninfiltration of snow meltwater produces a thermal pulse in the active layer, and can \n\nsignificantly hasten soil warming (Hinkel et al. 1997, 2001) showing negatives values of \n\nATD. During the summer due to the higher content of water the exchange heat is mainly by \n\nconduction as well. \n\n\n\n90 \n \n\n \n\n3.3. Intersite variations \n\nBoth sites showed significant differences of the mean annual ground temperature for \n\nall depths (Table 3). Moss carpet presented higher water content all long the years with great \n\nincreases during the summer (Figure 3). The soil temperature under Lichen cover closely \n\nfollowed the variability of air temperate. And moss carpet site showed higher soil moisture its \n\nlocation in an accumulation zone. \n\nThe soil from Lichen site exhibits higher number of thawing days for the surface \n\nlayers (10 and 30 cm depths) and a lower number of thawing days with last depth, evidencing \n\nan insulating behavior compromising the energy transfer to deeper layers when compared \n\nwith the soil from Moss site (Table 3). \n\nAlthough thawing days beginning in both sites in December 2009, at Moss site \n\nwarming reaches the deepest layer in the same month, while at Lichen site this occurs just in \n\nFebruary 2010 and ending in March (Table 3). \n\nDue to the translocation of water from the snowmelt to deeper layers the summer, heat \n\nexchange between air and soil layer is favored, then more heat flux is translocated to deeper \n\nlayers. This process happens in a reduced scale at the Lichen site due to the lower water \n\npercolation and dryness favored thermic isolation as promoted by air filling soil pores. Owing \n\nto this phenomen at Moss site, deeper layers experiments highest temperature in summer \n\n(Table 3). \n\nOwing to the late freezing during the winter and late thawing in the spring, the moss \n\nsite has more isothermal days than lichen site. Isothermal days are higher than the moss site \n\ndue to buffer effect cause by cover vegetation, and because landscape position (water track) \n\npromotes longer time of snow covering the surface during the winter and spring, which \n\nincrease moisture in soil profile. The isothermal days are concentrated during the autumn and \n\nsummer (Table 5) and the days with temperature close to 0\u00b0C has gradually increases in depth \n\nat moss site and been higher in all layers than lichen site, where exhibit abruptly increases of \n\nisothermal days in depth. Guglielmin et al. (2008) also observed isothermal days for Moss site \n\nthan Usnea site at Signy Island and also concentrated between April to October. \n\nIn general, freezing-thawing does not occur in the deepest layer at both sites, but it is \n\nmuch higher in lichen ground surface, what can indicate the buffer effect of the moss cover, \n\nnot been verified temperature fluctuation following atmosphere as occur within the lichen \n\narea.  \n\n\n\n91 \n \n\nThe freeze\u2013thaw days completely disappear at deeper layers in both sites, indicating \n\nthat diurnal fluctuations are smoothed. The freeze\u2013thaw cycles at this depth are also strongly \n\nreduced because during spring and fall (the periods in which air temperature more frequently \n\ncrossed the 0 \u00b0C threshold) far more heat will have been consumed in the water phase changes \n\ncausing the temperature fluctuations to be smoothed (Guglielmin et al., 2008). \n\nEstimated active layer is deeper at Moss (147.26 cm) than Lichen (120.22 cm) sites \n\ndue to lower thermal conductibility in Lichen soil because it is a drier soil. Both boreholes did \n\nnot reach the permafrost table. Similar to that observed by Kane et al. (2001) studying soils in \n\nAlaska, in Lions Rump the average depth of thaw is greater in vicinity of water tracks (Moss \n\nsite) than in inter-water track areas (Lichen site). In water track areas, the soil remains \n\nsaturated beyond the summer season; thus, it has an enhanced thermal conductivity compared \n\nto inter track areas. This enhanced thermal conductivity effectively supplies a warm boundary \n\ncondition for the upper surface to the mineral soil layer, thereby producing enhanced thaw in \n\nthese locations (Kane et al., 2001).  \n\nTypic Haploturbels evaluated during this study are present just above 80 m.a.s.l., \n\nespecially on the top areas and paraglacial spots, and represent Gelisols with gelic materials \n\nwithin 100 cm of the soil surface and permafrost within 200 cm of the soil surface; therefore, \n\nin lowlands at Lions Rump no Gelisols occur. Ramos and Vieira (2003) observed permafrost \n\nstarting deeper than 2.3 m in Livingston Island monitoring a borehole at 35 m.a.s.l.. \n\nIn general, active layer is typically greater than 90 cm for Maritime Antarctica areas as \n\nexposed by Vieira et al. (2010) considering others monitored boreholes in the South \n\nShetlands. \n\nPeriod where the soil profile has some liquid water available is during the thawing \n\nisothermal days (Thorn et al., 2002), so the sum of these periods can indicate when the \n\nchemical weathering process may occur. Following this reasoning these thermal conditions \n\nwere more favourable for chemical weathering in the moss site than in the lichen site for all \n\nsoil layers. \n\nAn interesting event occurred at early autumn where the zero curtain regime is longer \n\nat 80 cm at Moss then Lichen, but in the process of soil heating the change of phases solid to \n\nliquid (ice to liquid water) is longer at Lichen, probably due to soil profile be skeletic with \n\nlow water content, and air fill up the soil porous difficulting heat change.  \n\nMichel et al. (2012) observed soil texture as major influence on soil energy flux for \n\nsoils with different texture but similar vegetation cover in Potter and Fields Peninsula. They \n\nconsidered coarse nature of the soil seems to have a considerable influence on energy flux, \n\n\n\n92 \n \n\ncontributing to permafrost preservation. So the air filling the pores reduces the energy flux \n\nsimilar to results observed at Lichen site. \n\nWhen studied different sites with dissimilar vegetation cover Cannone et al. (2006) \n\nrelated unlike buffer effect of the different vegetations, occurs influence of vegetation on \n\nsnow distribution, thickness and longevity and that snow cover is thinner and melts earlier \n\nover the Usnea and Deschampsia sites than the Sanionia site. \n\nTemperature drops and increases more rapidly at Lichen site, but after the zero curtain \n\nregime at Moss site the temperature changes in a linear curve, while at Lichen site the changes \n\nare in harmonic waves (Figure 3). \n\nData from N-factor (FN) graphic (Figure 4) indicated differences of station freezing \n\nduration in the two years monitored. In 2009, the process began in late March and ended in \n\nDecember, while in 2010, began only in mid-April and ended in late October. In 2009, \n\nfreezing time are similar at both sites starting at Lichen one month ahead but ending as well \n\none month early. In 2009, the winter was more intense with lower temperatures so at Lichen \n\nsite, the driest soil, the freezing station starting early. In 2010, cold was less intense and \n\noscillation of temperatures above 0\u00b0C occur, them FN station started late. The isolation \n\npromoted by snow is more efficient in the beginning of winter decreasing along the cold \n\nseason, and it seems may be associated with metamorphism of snow crystals and their \n\ncompaction and loss of interstitial air during the winter (Nieuwendam, 2009). In this regard, it \n\nis interesting that in 2009 the values of FN in late winter stabilized around 0.3 at Moss site \n\nand 0.8 in the Lichen site, while in 2010 the stabilization occurred in 0.5 and 1.0, respectively. \n\nLower values of FN indicate better isolation promoted by the snow cover and reduced heat \n\nexchange between air and soil. Lower values at 2010 occurred possible by the greater \n\nthickness of snow cover in 2010 compared to 2009. Owing to the Moss site position on the \n\nlandscape (water track), the height of snow cover was higher than at Lichen site whereas is \n\nmore susceptible to winter remove. Results of FN were lower in Moss site within two years \n\nstudied (Figure 4), reinforcing a greater influence of snow cover at this site by buffering \n\ntemperature near 0 \u00b0 C for longer, due to its poor heat conduction. This is a useful parameter \n\nbecause of its simplicity and potential to determine the relationship between the physical \n\nconditions at the soil surface and atmospheric (Karunaratne e Burn, 2003). \n\n \n\n\n\n93 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.

It was used soil temperature at 10 cm to be closer to the soil surface.  \n\n \n\n \n\nMultivariate regression considering the temperature of the deepest layer as dependent \n\non air and the other layer's temperatures generated good equation estimatives for each site \n\n(Table 7). It adjusted R-squared was superior to 0.91 for both sites and standard errors for the \n\nbeta coefficients were in an acceptable range. The equations help us understand the joint \n\nlinear effect on the set of independent variables (beta coefficients) in predicting temperature \n\nof the bottom (80 cm) of the profile (dependent variable). As expected both sites were more \n\ninfluenced by the subsequent horizon (30 cm), presenting similar betas; and the contribution \n\nof air and uppermost soil temperatures (10 cm) was small, due to the time lag in temperature \n\nchanges (Figure 3A and 3B). These should be interpreted with care because the upper sensor \n\nA \n\nB \n\n\n\n94 \n \n\ndoes not reflect the actual soil surface temperature and the air temperature from distant \n\nweather stations may not reflect the exact air temperature at the studied sites.  \n\nAll beta coefficients were statistically significant. The equation proposed for Moss \n\noverestimates temperature peaks in summer and the predicted values diverged from observed \n\nones by a maximum of 7.97, a minimum of ?1.57, and an average of 0.14 but during the \n\nwinter the temperatures are too close (Figure 6). This overestimated temperature in Moss site \n\nduring summer can occur due to high-water  content present, then it is necessary more heat \n\nexchange to change soil temperature because the high-water  latent heat. In Lichen site, the \n\nsoil is drier and the values estimated from the equations were close to those registered with \n\nthe sensors with uniform behavior throughout the studied period. Residues ranged from a \n\nmaximum of 2.80 to a minimum of ?3.11 with an average of 0.18 (Figure 6). Observed values \n\nat Moss are more concentrated between -4 to 4 \u00b0C and Lichen between -10 to 3 \u00b0C, what can \n\nprove the more influence of air temperatures to promote changes in bottommost layers, what \n\nis buffered at Moss site due to the long lasting time of snow cover; the isolation promoted by \n\nthe moss carpet and the highest water content. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 7.

Conclusions \n\nThe active layer thermal regime in the two soils studied at Lions Rump, Maritime \n\nAntarctica, is typical of periglacial environments, with major variation close to the surface \n\nduring summer resulting in frequent freeze and thaw cycles. The great majorities of the soil \n\ntemperature readings for both sites were close to 0 \u00b0C resulting in low freezing and thawing \n\ndegree days. Both soils have low thermal apparent diffusivity.  \n\nThe temperature profile of the soils during the studied period indicates that the active \n\nlayer thickness was approximately 150 cm at Moss site and 120 cm at Lichen site. This \n\nindicates that the permafrost table was not deeper than 200 cm from the surface, corroborating \n\nwith the classification of these soils as Cryosols or Gelisols, with clear turbic features.  \n\nThe difference in moisture regimes for the studied sites was attributed to the soil \n\nvegetation cover and principal by site location on the landscape.  \n\nThe temperature buffer effect of mosses appears to be associated with snow cover and \n\nespecially by local higher water content. \n\nFor better understanding of how works the hydrothermal dinamyc of permafrost \n\naffect-soils it is necessary installation of humid probes along the soil layers together with soil \n\ntemperature sensors. \n\nData presented are obtained from less than two years of monitoring, which limits \n\nconclusive interpretations in terms of warming or cooling trends, permafrost distribution and \n\neffects of climate change on the studied soils. Nevertheless, as part of a long term active layer \n\nmonitoring program, these results are important as a benchmark for future interpretations. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.

Typic Dystrogelepts \n\nornithic e Typic Gelorthents ornithic s\u00e3o os principais solos ornitog\u00eanicos e mais evolu\u00eddos \n\ndo que Gelisolos.
