dessor\u00e7\u00e3o e especia\u00e7\u00e3o de Zn, Pb and Cd em um solo contaminado por \n\natividades de minera\u00e7\u00e3o e tratado com calcita, fosfato, biocarv\u00e3o e bioss\u00f3lido \n\n\u00c1reas de minera\u00e7\u00e3o produzem grandes quantidades de res\u00edduos que s\u00e3o importantes \n\nfontes de elementos potencialmente t\u00f3xicos (EPT), tais como os metais pesados. Esses EPTs \n\npodem contaminar o meio ambiente e causar s\u00e9rias amea\u00e7as ao ecossistema e \u00e0 sa\u00fade humana. A \n\nremedia\u00e7\u00e3o in-situ pela adi\u00e7\u00e3o de condicionadores \u00e9 alternativa eficiente para a imobiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ncontaminantes e para redu\u00e7\u00e3o dos riscos associados a esses poluentes. Fosfato, calcita e compostos \n\norg\u00e2nicos s\u00e3o os condicionadores mais utilizadas para remedia\u00e7\u00e3o in-situ. Neste estudo foi \n\navaliado o efeito da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de condicionadores na cin\u00e9tica de dessor\u00e7\u00e3o e especia\u00e7\u00e3o de Zn, Cd \n\ne Pb em um solo contaminado por atividades de minera\u00e7\u00e3o. O solo foi coletado em uma \u00e1rea \n\ndesativada de minera\u00e7\u00e3o de Zn, localizada na cidade de Vazante, MG. A solo contaminado foi \n\nincubado com fosfato, carbonato de c\u00e1lcio, biocarv\u00e3o ou bioss\u00f3lido. A cin\u00e9tica de dessor\u00e7\u00e3o foi \n\navaliada pelo m\u00e9todo fluxo constante com a solu\u00e7\u00e3o de Mehlich-3. A especia\u00e7\u00e3o foi realizada por \n\nespectroscopia de absor\u00e7\u00e3o de raios-x (XAS) e extra\u00e7\u00e3o sequencial, enquanto a an\u00e1lise absor\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nraios-x pr\u00f3xima da borda (XANES) foi realizada para Pb e Zn. Tamb\u00e9m realizamos o mapeamento \n\npor ?-XRF (microfluoresc\u00eancia de raios-x) e em alguns pontos no mapa realizamos a especia\u00e7\u00e3o \n\npor ?-XANES do Zn no solo tratado com fosfato. Foi tamb\u00e9m conduzido um experimento com \n\ncolunas para avaliar a lixivia\u00e7\u00e3o de Zn, Pb e Cd no solo tratado com fosfato. A adi\u00e7\u00e3o de fosfato \n\nafetou as esp\u00e9cies de Zn. No entanto, algumas esp\u00e9cies de Zn que foram formadas e assim podem \n\nser mobilizadas com mais facilidade. O Zn foi mais facilmente mobilizado na maior taxa de \n\nfosfato, provavelmente devido \u00e0 diminui\u00e7\u00e3o do pH. Os tratamentos com bioss\u00f3lido, biocarv\u00e3o e \n\ncalcita n\u00e3o alteraram as esp\u00e9cies de Zn. No entanto, em algumas doses, a dessor\u00e7\u00e3o de Zn \n\ndiminuiu, enquanto o teor de Zn aumentou na fra\u00e7\u00e3o recalcitrante. As principais esp\u00e9cies no solo \n\nsem altera\u00e7\u00f5es foram a bentonita Pb e a anglesita. O solo corrigido com calcita diminuiu a cin\u00e9tica \n\nde dessor\u00e7\u00e3o do Pb e aumentou o Pb extra\u00eddo na fra\u00e7\u00e3o residual, o que pode ser devido \u00e0 forma\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde piromorfita. Os solos tratados com bioss\u00f3lido e com biocarv\u00e3o aumentaram o teor de Pb \n\nassociado \u00e0 mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica e diminu\u00edram na fra\u00e7\u00e3o residual. Nestes tratamentos parte das \n\nesp\u00e9cies de Pb presentes neste solo foi transformada em Pb ligado a citrato. Essas altera\u00e7\u00f5es \n\norg\u00e2nicas aumentaram substancialmente a cin\u00e9tica de dessor\u00e7\u00e3o do Pb em todas as doses \n\nadicionadas. Os tratamentos com biocarv\u00e3o e com bioss\u00f3lido foram efetivos para diminuir a \n\ndessor\u00e7\u00e3o de Cd.

These PTEs can contaminate the environment and \n\ncause serious threats to the ecosystem and human health. The in-situ remediation by the addition of \n\namendments is an efficient alternative for the immobilization of contaminants and for reduction of \n\nthe risks associated with these pollutants. Phosphate, lime, and organic compounds are the most \n\nused amendments for in-situ remediation. We evaluated the effect of rates of amendments in \n\ndesorption kinetics and speciation of Zn, Cd, and Pb in a soil contaminated by mining activities. \n\nThe soil was collected in a disabled Zn mining area in the city of Vazante, state of Minas Gerais, \n\nBrazil. The contaminated soil was incubated with either phosphate, or calcium carbonate, or \n\nbiochar, or biosolid. Desorption kinetics was evaluated by the \"stirred-flow\" method that consists of \n\na constant flow with a Mehlich-3 solution. The speciation was performed by X-ray absorption \n\nspectroscopy (XAS) and sequential extraction. The analysis with synchrotron radiation X-ray \n\nabsorption near the edge (XANES) was performed for Pb and Zn. We also performed a mapping by \n\n?-XRF (micro X-ray fluorescence) and in some spots on the map we performed the speciation by ?-\n\nXANES for Zn in the soil amended with phosphate. An experiment with columns was carried out \n\nwith samples from the soil amended with phosphate to evaluate leaching of Zn, Pb, and Cd. The \n\ntreatment with phosphate affected the species of Zn. However, some Zn species that were formed \n\nand can be mobilized most easily. Zn was more easily mobilized in the highest rate of phosphate \n\nprobably because of the decrease of the pH. The treatments with biosolid, biochar and calcite did \n\nnot change Zn species. However, in some rates, Zn desorption decreased while Zn contents \n\nincreased in the recalcitrant fraction. The main species in the unamended soil was Pb-bentonite and \n\nanglesite. The soil amended with calcite and pyromorphite decreased the desorption kinetics of Pb \n\nand increased the Pb extracted in the residual fraction, and this could be due to formation of \n\npyromorphite. The soil amended with biosolid and biochar increased the Pb extracted in the organic \n\nfraction and decreased in the residual fraction. In these treatments part of the species of Pb present \n\non this soil was transformed in Pb-citrate. The addition of biochar and biosolid increased the \n\ndesorption kinetics of Pb in all rates applied. The treatment with either biochar or biosolid was \n\neffective to decrease the Cd desorption. In these organic amendments, the content of Cd associated \n\nto organic matter (OM)increased. The treatments with phosphate and calcite also increased the Cd \n\nassociated to OM extracted in the F3. These inorganic amendments were effective to decrease the \n\ndesorption kinetics of Cd. \n\nKeywords: Desorption kinetics; X-ray absorption spectroscopy; Remediation of soils; Heavy \n\nmetals; Soil pollution \n\n  \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\n1 INTRODUCTION \n\nActivities of mining and processing of metals are of important because it ensures the \n\nproduction of raw material for the manufacture of goods which are indispensable for the man \n\nand provide many other benefits to society and the development of the country. However, the \n\nenvironmental damage they cause can be large, thus posing a serious threat to ecosystems and \n\nhuman health. These activities have resulted in a generation of high amount of waste, which is \n\na great source of trace elements, such as cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn), and \n\nconsequently, may cause a substantial environmental contamination (Alloway, 2013). \n\nThe metals/pollutants can enter the human body through ingestion, inhalation, dermal \n\ncontact, which represents a considerable threat to humans (Bi et al., 2006; Pelfr\u00eane et al., \n\n2011). Adverse environmental impacts of contaminated mining areas include the risk to \n\nhuman health, the phytotoxicity, contamination of water and soil and the ecotoxicity (Anju; \n\nBanerjee, 2010). In response, the development of technologies to remediate heavy metals \n\ncontaminated soils has been encouraged (Gray et al., 2006). \n\nTechniques for remediation of soils based on the excavation and the deposition on the \n\nlandfill are highly effective in reducing the risk, but they are very expensive (Basta; \n\nMcgowen, 2004). Furthermore, the engineering technologies are often invasive and do not \n\nallow natural recovery of the environment (Lombi et al., 2002). Innovative and low-cost \n\ntechniques are required for decontamination of soils. A promising technology is the \n\nstabilization in situ of heavy metals in soil by the addition of amendments, such as phosphates \n\n(Baker et al., 2014; Sanderson et al., 2015) alkaline materials (Ok et al., 2010; Basta et al., \n\n2004), biochars (Puga et al., 2016; Abdelhafez et al., 2014) and organic compounds \n\n(Ahumada et al., 2014; Sindhu et al., 2016). \n\nIn situ stabilization of metals is based on the reduction of metal mobility and \n\navailability, either by precipitation or by increased sorption (Lee et al., 2009). The use of soil \n\namendments may decrease the solubility of metals and reduce their harmful effects on \n\nmicroorganisms, plants, aquatic organisms and humans (Lombi et al., 2002). \n\nPossible mechanisms to explain the increase in retention and/or immobilization of \n\nmetals, in the presence of P, include (i) the formation of phosphate of metals, which are low \n\nsoluble precipitates in soils (Crannell et al., 2000), (ii) increase in negative net charge (Peres-\n\nNovo et al., 2009) and availability of surface phosphate groups in which metals can associate \n\nto form ternary complex (Guilherme; Anderson, 1998). Phosphorus is able to neutralize \n\ncompletely or partially or even reverse the positive charge prevalent on the surface of Fe and \n\nAl hydroxides in acidic soils (Lima et al., 2000). \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe addition of alkaline compounds such as calcium carbonate increases the retention \n\nof metals in soils due to the increase in pH and has a great influence on the solubility of \n\nmetals (Adriano, 2001). A high soil pH may precipitate the metals as hydroxides, phosphates, \n\nand carbonates and also promote the formation of quite stable metal-organic complexes \n\n(Kabata, 2011). However, precipitates formed due to the application of calcium carbonate can \n\nbe easily dissolved and released into the soil solution. Carbonates of Pb can be easily \n\ndissolved by organic acids released by the rhizosphere of plants, easily extracted by acidic \n\nsolutions and easily dissolved in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals (Essington, \n\n2005). \n\nOrganic materials such as organic fertilizer and biochar can immobilize the metals by \n\nmeans of adsorption, complexation, and precipitation reactions. This occurs because of: (i) the \n\nincrease of cationic exchange capacity (CEC) of the soils that promotes the increase of \n\nadsorption of metals, and (ii) the formation of insoluble and soluble complex with the organic \n\nconstituents because of high affinity for heavy metals by functional groups of the organic \n\ncompounds (Bolan et al., 2014). \n\nOne of the objectives of the addition of amendments is to reduce the leaching of \n\nmetals in the soil profile, thus decreasing the risks of contamination of groundwater. A \n\nleaching study in columns can give us important information about the potential of \n\nremediators in decreasing the leaching of metals. This study is necessary to evaluate the \n\nimmobilization and to evaluate if the treatment has reduced or increased concentrations of \n\nmetals in the leachate. Houben et al. (2012) evaluated the leaching of heavy metals in a \n\nTechnosol in an urban area from Li\u00e8ge, eastern Belgium, and observed that the addition of \n\ncalcium carbonate reduced the concentrations in the leachate in 88% for Cd, 98% for Zn and \n\n57% for Pb.  \n\nThe speciation of metals in contaminated soils is an important tool for development \n\nand understanding of processes and reaction mechanisms that control the transport of \n\nnutrients and contaminants. By knowing the species present in soil, it is possible to obtain \n\ninformation on which phases control the bioavailability of metals and their kinetics of release \n\n(Sparks, 2014). \n\nThe distribution of heavy metals in soil fractions may be evaluated by indirect \n\nmethods, such as the sequential extraction. However, direct methods of determination based \n\non the spectroscopy absorption of X-rays have been developed. Methods of analysis spectral \n\nfeatures of X-rays provide information about the dispersion of the elements and contribute to \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nidentify the phases of mineral in the soils, for obtaining the mechanisms of sorption on a \n\nmolecular level and the speciation of atomic structure site (Lombi and Susini, 2009). Such \n\nmethods guarantee the selectivity and sensitivity of the local structure of a wide variety of \n\nelements, a high spatial resolution, and limit of detection and a simple preparation of the \n\nsample, which makes this method the most accurate in the study of the composition of \n\ncontaminants in soils (Nevidomskaya et al., 2015). \n\nThe X-ray absorption near the edge (XANES) and the X-ray absorption fine structure \n\n(EXAFS) are spectroscopic techniques that provide essential information about the forms of \n\nheavy metals in the soil (Manceau et al., 2002). XANES is used to assist in the study of the \n\nelectronic structure of substances, the determination of the symmetry and the energy of \n\nmolecular orbitals vague in molecules (Soldatov, 2008). This method can provide information \n\nabout the degree of oxidation and the symmetry of its sphere of coordination (Singh and \n\nGraefe, 2010). The absorption of X-rays is widely used in the speciation of metals in soils \n\nafter addition of amendments (Baker et al., 2012, 2014; Montenegro et al., 2015; Sanderson et \n\nal., 2015).  \n\nThe integration of studies of kinetics, leaching, and speciation provide important \n\ninformation about which chemical processes (precipitation, complexation, a formation of \n\ncomplexes of the internal or external sphere) will occur with metals present in the soil after \n\nthe addition of amendments. With this information, one can create new strategies for \n\nremediation in situ of contaminated soil, thereby minimizing its mobility and bioavailability. \n\n \n\nReferences \n\nAbdelhafez, A.A.; LI, J.; Abbas, M.h.h.

Zinc (Zn) is an \n\nelement essential to plants and humans, but it can also be toxic to human beings, plants, animals, \n\nand microorganisms in high concentrations. The in-situ stabilization of heavy metals by the addition \n\nof amendments may be an effective and cost-effective strategy to decrease the risks associated with \n\nsuch heavy metals. The soil utilized in our study was collected from a deactivated mining area \n\nlocated in Vazante, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil and was amended with rates of phosphate, \n\ncalcite, biochar, and biosolids to immobilize the Zn on the soil. After the addition of these \n\namendments, the soil was incubated for 60 days with deionized water at 70% of maximum water \n\nretention. The soil was chemically and mineralogically characterized, and we performed sequential \n\nextraction, desorption kinetics and speciation using synchrotron-based techniques, such as \u00b5-\n\nXANES, \u00b5-XRF, and bulk XANES. The soil amended with phosphate was the only one that had \n\ndifferent species of Zn identified by using linear combination fitting. In the course of these \n\ntreatments gahnite, Zn-LDH, Zn3(PO4), ZnO were identified by bulk XANES, while Zn-\n\nferrihydrite, Zn-montmorillonite and Scholzite were also identified by \u00b5-XANES. The best fit \n\ncombination for bulk XANES were standards for all other treatments including Zn-montmorillonite, \n\nZn-kerolite, Zn-ferrihydrite and gahnite, and these species were also identified by the \u00b5-XANES. \n\nThe soil amended with phosphate had total correlation and partial correlation with Ni, Co, Fe, Cr, \n\nMn, Si, P, Cd, Pb and Cd, while the unamended soil had correlation with Cu, Pb, Fe and Si. \n\nExcluding the highest rate of P, the quarter rate and half rate which decreased the desorption \n\nkinetics of Zn. Calcite and the organic amendments (biochar and biosolids) were also effective in \n\nreducing the Zn desorption kinetics. \n\n \n\nKeywords: X-ray absorption near edge structure; Soil pollution; Remediation of soils; heavy \n\nmetals \n\n \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\nMore than 2,647 mining areas in Brazil account for almost 5% of the Brazilian Gross \n\nDomestic Product and 20% of total jobs.1 Mining and smelting activities, however, are \n\nprojected to generate 11.4 million metric tons of waste between 2010 and 2030.1 In 2014, \n\nBrazil produced 170 kiloton of Zn, which is about 1.5% of world production.2 Part of this \n\nproduction is from mining areas in the Vazante region, located in the state of Minas Gerais,3 \n\nhome to one of the major known deposits of non-sulfide zinc in the world.4 \n\nMining wastes typically present a high content of potentially toxic elements such as zinc \n\n(Zn), lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) that are usually found on the surface of soils.5 Once \n\nmobilized in soils, these elements can be transferred to groundwater and plants, and present a \n\npotential threat to threaten human health.6 Although Zn is an element essential to the \n\nmetabolism of plants and animals,7 in excess it can lead to toxicity. \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMost soils from the humid tropics are particularly unique because they are highly \n\nweathered (e.g., Oxisols) and rich in Fe, Al, and Mn (hydr)oxide minerals that have \n\npredominantly pH-dependent surface charge.8 These (hydr)oxide minerals immobilize heavy-\n\nmetal cations such as Zn2+, Pb2+, Cu2+, Cd2+ at high pH (> 7),9 and oxyanions such as H2AsO4\n- \n\nand HSeO3\n- at low pH (&lt;7).10 Mine soils usually present pH values near to 7.11 However, this \n\nvalue can decrease over time due to high precipitation and temperature, thereby increasing the \n\navailability of toxic trace elements.8 Brazil has the potential to increase soil contamination by \n\nzinc and other metals as a result of different processes, such as fertilizer application and \n\nsmelter and mining activities.12 New strategies are necessary to reduce the risks associated \n\nwith these heavy metals because the utilization of techniques based on excavation and \n\ndeposition at landfills becomes unfeasible.  \n\nInnovative and cost-effective techniques are required for the decontamination of soils. A \n\npromising technology is the in situ stabilization of heavy metals by the addition of \n\namendments such as phosphate,13,14 alkaline materials,15,16 biochar,17,18 and organic \n\ncompounds.19,20 These amendments are reported to reduce the environmental risks associated \n\nwith heavy metals in soils by the formation of low soluble salts or precipitates, and increased \n\nsorption.21 Understanding the chemical environment of heavy metals in the soils is an \n\nimportant step towards a rational use of the amendments, which can optimize the effects of \n\nsuch treatments. Synchrotron radiation techniques such as X-ray fluorescence microanalysis \n\n(Micro-XRF) and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) are the best \n\ntechniques to know the metal speciation and their possible associations in complex \n\nenvironmental media due to their selectivity of elements studied and due to their high \n\nresolution. These techniques  are state-of-art tools that can probe Zn local atomic structure in \n\nsoils, minerals and sediments.22\u201325 \n\nIn this study we aimed to characterize Zn desorption and speciation from a mine-\n\nwaste affected Brazilian soil. Zinc speciation and desorption kinetics were investigated before \n\nand after the addition of the following amendments: NH4H2PO4, CaCO3, Biochar, and \n\nBiosolid. We used the synchrotron-based Micro-XRF and XANES, stirred-flow kinetic \n\napproach, and sequential extraction. The information provided in this study will be important \n\nto creating new strategies for in-situ stabilization of Zn in tropical soils impacted by mine-\n\nwaste. \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\n2.2 Materials and Methods \n\n2.2.1 Soil Sampling and Characterization \n\nSoil samples of a Technosol were collected from the surface layer (0-20 cm) of a Zn \n\nmining area located in Vazante, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil (close to geographic \n\ncoordinates (17o59\u201911\u2019\u2019S, 46o54\u201927\u201dW). The soil was air dried at room temperature and \n\npassed through a 2-mm sieve for further analysis. Soil organic C content was determined with \n\na Shimadzu TOC-5000. The pseudo-total concentrations of Cd, Pb and Zn in the soil sample \n\nwere extracted according to the EPA3051a method (1:3 HCl/HNO3, v/v)\n26 and quantified by \n\ninductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Other chemical \n\nanalyses (exchangeable ions and pH) followed the methods of Ingram and Anderson.27 XRD \n\nwas performed in the bulk soil, the clay, sand, and silt fractions. We also performed XRD in \n\nthe clay fraction after both concentrating the iron oxides with 5 M NaOH, 28 and applying \n\ntreatment with sodium dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DCB) for removing the free iron \n\noxides.29 More information about the XRD procedure can be found in the Supporting \n\nInformation Available section. \n\n \n\n2.2.2 Production and Characterization of Biochar and Biosolid \n\nThe biochar was produced from sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) straw with \n\npyrolysis at 450oC. Detailed information about the production and characterization are \n\ndescribed in Feola Conz et al.30. The biosolid was produced from the composting of wood \n\nchips (eucalyptus) and sewage sludge. The composting took place in aerated rows for 60 days \n\nand was sieved through a mesh with 36 mm2 holes. In the composting process, about 2% of \n\ndolomitic limestone was added to the sludge. The sewage sludge was collected at a sewage \n\ntreatment station located in Jundiai, in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil and was composed, for \n\nthe most part, of domestic rather than industrial sludge. The pH of biosolid was determined in \n\nwater extracts (1:5 v/v), CEC was determined as described by Sparks31 and organic C content \n\nwas determined by the Walkley and Black method. The total concentration of Cd, Pb, Zn, P, \n\nK, Ca and Mg in the biochar and biosolid were determined following the EPA3051a method.26  \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2.3 Amendments and Incubation Time \n\nThe soil was amended individually in triplicate with biochar, biosolid, calcite \n\n(CaCO3), and ammonium phosphate monobasic (NH4H2PO4). Phosphorus (P) was applied \n\nevenly to the soil at 0 (control), 0.5 (quarter rate), 1 (half rate), and 2:1 (full rate) molar ratio \n\nof P as related to the sum of Pb, Cd, and Zn. These rates were based on the stoichiometric \n\n(P:M =3:5) form of the following precipitate M5(PO4)3OH (M= sum of Zn, Pb and Cd).\n32\n\n \n\nTreatment with calcium carbonate (CaCO3) was based on the formation of metal-carbonate \n\nprecipitates, with general formula [MCO3], where M=Mtotal(Zn+Pb+Cd).\n16 M:CO3 (full rate) molar \n\nratio of 0.5:1 (half rate) and 0.25:1 (quarter rate) were also utilized. The biochar was applied \n\nat the rates of 2.5, 5.0, and 10%,33 and biosolid at 5, 10, and 20% relative to the mass of soil.20 \n\nThe amendments were homogenized with the soil through mixing and incubated in the lab \n\nwith deionized water at 25\u00b12oC for 60 days at 70% of the maximum water retention capacity. \n\nWater was added every three days based on the mass loss of water to maintain this degree of \n\nhumidity. \n\n \n\n2.2.4 Bulk XANES \n\nZn-K edge XANES analysis was carried out on the samples that received the highest \n\nrate of each treatment at the XAFS2 beamline at the LNLS (Brazilian Synchrotron Light \n\nLaboratory), located in Campinas, in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. The measurements were \n\nperformed in transmission mode using a Si (111) double crystal monochromator. Energy \n\ncalibration was performed using a Zn metal foil positioned between the second and the third \n\nionization chamber. The soil samples were ground and 150 mg was pressed down to 5 mm \n\ndiameter pellets, 1.3 cm2 in size. Three XANES spectra were collected per sample and the \n\nspectra were acquired across the energy range of -130 to 340 eV relative to the Zn-K edge \n\nenergy at 9659 eV. These spectra were energy calibrated, aligned, merged, and normalized \n\nusing the Athena program within the IFEFFIT package. Linear combination fitting (LCF) \n\nanalysis were carried out across an energy range of -20 to 80 eV relative to E0 using the \n\nmethod developed by Manceau et al.34 to deconvolute different Zn species present and their \n\nrelative contributions to the observed Zn spectrum (Figure S3). Additional information about \n\nthe bulk XANES procedure and standards (Table S2) utilized for the LCF analysis are in the \n\nSupporting Information Available Section below. \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\n2.2.5 Micro-XRF and Micro-XANES Measurements. \n\nMicro-XRF imaging and spectroscopy were performed on the phosphate-amended and \n\nunamended soil sample that was air-dried, ground, and prepared as thin sections of ~20 \u00b5m \n\nthickness. For the P-amended soil we used sub-micron resolution X-ray (SRX) Beamline (5-\n\nID) of the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) at Brookhaven National \n\nLaboratory, located in Upton, New York, USA.  A focused spot of 1 \u00b5m x 0.7 \u00b5m controlled \n\nby Kirkpatrick?Baez mirrors and Si (111) horizontal double-crystal monochromator crystals \n\nwere used at this beamline.   \n\nMicro-XRF analysis was carried out using an incident beam energy of 15 keV and the \n\nfluorescence signals were received by a three-element Si drift detector. The map plotted a 120 \n\n\u00b5m x 120 \u00b5m area of the sample, using a step size of 1 \u00b5m and a 1 s acquisition time. The \u00b5-\n\nXRF mapping technique was used to image the distribution of Zn, Si, P, Ca, Fe, Al, Mg, K, \n\nPb, Mn, Cu and Ni. For the unamended soil, the analyses were completed using \u00b5-XRF and \n\n\u00b5-XANES at the D09B-XRF Beamline at the LNLS.  \n\nA focused 20 \u00b5m diameter spot size controlled by a KB mirror system and Si (111) \n\ncrystal monochromator were used. Micro-XRF analysis was carried out using an incident \n\nbeam energy of 15keV and the fluorescence signals were measured by a silicon drift detector \n\n(SDD; AXAS-A, KETEK GmbH, Germany). The map was plotted across a 4,000 x 3,000 \u00b5m \n\narea of sample, using a step size of 30 \u00b5m and 0.3 sec acquisition time. The \u00b5-XRF mapping \n\ntechnique was used to image the distribution of Zn, Fe and Si.  \n\nZinc K-edge \u00b5-XANES were collected from ten and then three additional Zn spots \n\nacross the \u00b5-XRF map in the P-amended soil and un-amended soil, respectively. Five XANES \n\nspectra were collected per sample and were acquired across the energy range of -100 to 200 \n\neV relative to the Zn-K edge energy at 9659 eV. These spectra were energy calibrated, \n\naligned, merged, and normalized using the Athena program in the IFEFFIT package. LCF \n\nanalysis was carried out across an energy range of -20 to 80 eV and -20 to 40 eV relative to \n\nE0 for the P-amended and unamended soil, respectively. The fit results were obtained using \n\nthe Manceau approach described above for bulk XANES. Additional information about \u00b5-\n\nXANES procedure and standards (Table S2) utilized for the LCF analysis are in the \n\nSupporting Information Available section below. \n\n \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2.6 Statistical Analyses of \u00b5-XRF Images \n\nNatural log-transformed \u00b5-XRF intensity data normalized to the incoming X-ray \n\nintensity (I0) was used to develop a statistical relationship between Zn and other matrix \n\nelements (Ca, Cr, Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Cd, P, Cu, Si). Pearson correlation and also partial \n\ncorrelation analyses were done to remove the effects of other confounding variables. All \n\nstatistical analyses were carried out using the R statistical software package (version 3.2.3). \n\nCorrelations were considered significant where ? = 0.05. \n\n \n\n2.2.7 Desorption Experiments \n\nZinc desorption kinetics were carried out using a stirred-flow reactor equipped with a \n\npiston displacement pump designed for use in an HPLC system (Figure S7 in SI). A 12 mL \n\nstirred-flow chamber was used in these experiments to which 0.2 g of&lt;2 mm sieved of each \n\namended soil samples were added.  Mehlich-3 solution (0.2M CH3COOH + \n\n0.25M NH4NO3 + 0.013M HNO3 + 0.015M NH4F + 0.001M EDTA) solution was the \n\ndesorption agent. The use of Mehlich-3 has been reported to estimate the heavy metals \n\navailability for plants35 and to estimate your bioaccessibility.36 A 25-mm diameter cellulose \n\nfilter membrane with a 0.45 \u00b5m pore size was used in the reaction chamber. The solution \n\nflowed through the chamber at a rate of 1 mL min-1 and the suspension in the reaction \n\nchamber was stirred at 300 rpm. The effluent was collected from the reactor at 2 min intervals \n\nover a period of 2 h, and Zn concentration was determined by ICP-OES. The desorption \n\nkinetic of Zn was calculated according to Yin et al.37 and plotted in cumulative Zn desorption \n\npercentages. \n\n \n\n2.2.8 Sequential Fractionation Procedures \n\nThe sequential fractions of the humid tropical soils were determined following the \n\nprocedure developed by Silveira et al.38. The original method numbers seven fractions, but in \n\nthe present study we extracted the following sequentially with 0.1 M CaCl2 for readily \n\nexchangeable (F1); 1 M NaOAC (pH 5) for carbonates forms (F2); NaOCl (pH 8.5) for \n\norganic-matter bound (F3); 0.2M oxalic acid + 0.2M NH4 oxalate (pH 3) for iron-oxides \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nbound (F4); and the residual (F5) was obtained after digestion following the EPA3051a \n\nmethod 26. The Zn concentration in each fraction was quantified by ICP-OES. \n\n \n\n2.3 Results \n\n2.3.1 Soil, Biochar, and Biosolid Characteristics \n\nSoils from the mining area were considered hazardous because the concentrations of \n\nZn, Pb, and Cd in these soils exceeded the intervention values adopted by the state of S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo for industrial or residential areas, which were 10,000 mg kg-1,of Zn, 4,400 mg kg-1 of \n\nPb, and 14.0 mg kg-1 of Cd 39 (Table 1; Table S1 in SI). \n\n \n\nTable 1.

Soil C \n\ncontents increased by 5.3 fold when amended with biochar and 1.9 fold when amended with \n\nbiosolid. The XRD indicated the presence of Goethite (?-FeO(OH)), Hematite (Fe2O3) , \n\nKaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4), Gibbsite (Al(OH)3, Muscovite (KAl3Si3O10(OH)2), Clinochlore \n\n((Mg,Fe2+)5Al2Si3O10(OH)8), Montmorillonite ((Na,Ca)0,3(Al,Mg)2Si4O10(OH)2\u2022n(H2O)), and \n\nQuartz (SiO2) (Figure S1 in SI). The organic amendments had a high pH and high CEC \n\n(Table 2). The biochar had 4.3 times more carbon than biosolids, whereas biosolids had a \n\nhigher concentration of macronutrients (P, Mg, Ca,) and trace elements (Cd, Pb, Zn) than \n\nbiochar. \n\nTable 2.

When the P amended samples were excluded, \n\nthe best fit combination of standards for all other treatments included 26-30% Zn-\n\nmontmorillonite, 40-41% Zn-kerolite (Zn2.1Mg0.9Si4O10(OH)2.nH2O), 18-24% Zn-ferrihydrite, \n\nand 10-14% Gahnite (ZnAl2O4). The treatment with P had a fit with Gahnite (20%), Zn-LDH \n\n(Zn Layered double hydroxides) (16%), Zn3(PO4)2 (49%), and ZnO (15%). \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 1.

Zinc was co-localized with Fe, Si, Al, Mg \n\nand Ni, and the P was co-localized with Cu, Zn, Ni, Fe, and Ca. Similarly, the hotspot of Pb \n\nand Mn were co-localized, but its spatial distribution was different from Zn. The two hotspots \n\nfrom Zn (spot 10 and 4 on the XRF map) also co-localized with two hotspots of Ni. In our \n\nstudy, Zn had strong significant correlation with Ni (r = 0.62), Co (r = 56), Fe (r = 53), and Cr \n\n(r = 51) (Table S3 in SI). However, the partial correlation analysis carried out to remove the \n\nconfounding effects of other elements had highest correlation with Ni (r\u2019 = 0.56), Mn (r\u2019 = \n\n0.38), and Pb (r\u2019 = -0.29). The partial correlation coefficients decreased when compared to the \n\nPearson correlation coefficient, implying the dependent spatial relationship between Zn and \n\nNi, Co, Fe, and Cr on other co-localized elements present. The \u00b5-XRF image in the \n\nunamended soil showed the spatial distribution of Zn, Cu and Si (Figure S3 in SI). Zn had \n\nsignificant (p &lt;0.05) correlation with Cu (r = 19), Pb (r = 2.0), Si (r = 8.0), and Fe (r = 2.0) \n\n(Table S4 in SI), whereas partial correlation had significant correlation only with Cu (r = 20) \n\nand Si (r = 9.0). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \nFigure 2.

Spots 1 and 2 had a fit with Zn-ferrihydrite (10-16%) and only spot 1 had a \n\nfit with Zn-kerolite (20%). These data agreed with the LCF performed in the bulk XANES, \n\nwhere the same species were identified (Table 3). \n\nMicro-XANES spectra in the P-amended soil collected from ten spots showed \n\nvariations (Fig. 2). However, the merge of these ten spectra was very similar to the spectra of \n\nthe bulk XANES (Figure S2 in SI). Considering the size of the microprobe beam (10 \u00b5m2) \n\nand bulk beam (107 \u00b5m2), 10 \u00b5-XANES spectra represented only 0.0001% of the lateral \n\nsample area irradiated by the bulk beam. This result shows that the \u00b5-XANES can be \n\nrepresentative of the bulk XANES analyses and has the advantage of being able to identify \n\nspecies that cannot be deconvolved using bulk XANES. \n\n The best-fit combination of standards for all ten spots included 8-35% Zn3(PO4)2, \n\n19-35% Scholzite (CaZn2(PO4)2\u20222(H2O)), 21-40% Gahnite, 23-100% Zn-LDH, 8-30% Zn-\n\nmontmorillonite, 20-24% Zn-ferrihydrite (Table 4), whereas bulk XANES fit results did not \n\nshow any fit with the standards of Scholzite and Zn-montmorillonite. However, the Zn-\n\nmontmorillonite standard had a significant fit in the \u00b5-XANES and bulk XANES results of \n\nthe unamended soil. The greater proportion of gahnite in the fit was found in two \u201chot spots\u201d \n\n(spots 9 and 10), consistent with results obtained by Kirpichtchikova et al.40 \n\n \n\nTable 4.

To compare the desorption \n\nbehavior of treatments and their rates, the amount of Zn desorbed was normalized to the total \n\nsoil Zn concentration and plotted as a function of time (Figure 3; Figure S5 in SI). For each \n\ntreatment receiving a higher rate, the amount of Zn desorbed after 2 h ranged between 21 to \n\n18 % for biosolid and biochar, respectively. During the initial time of desorption, the P-\n\namended soil had the highest desorption, and the calcite amended soil had the lowest. The soil \n\namended with lower rates of calcite and P desorbed less Zn after 2h compared to the higher \n\nrates. For the treatments with biochar and biosolid the rates that desorbed less Zn were the 5% \n\nand 10% respectively. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3. Cumulative Zn desorption (%) Mehlich-3 in the mining area treated with phosphate, \n\ncalcite biochar and biosolid. \n\n \n\n2.3.4 Sequential Extraction \n\nThe P-amended soil was the only one with detectable amounts of Zn in F1 extracted \n\nwith 0.1 M CaCl2 and increased the Zn in the F2 (extracted with 1M NaOAC (pH 5)) (Figure \n\n4; Figure S6 in SI). Similarly, the treatments with calcite and biosolid also had increased Zn \n\nextracted in the F2 in a number of their lower rates (Figure S5 in SI). Except for the treatment \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nwith calcite, all the treatments increased Zn in the F3 extracted with 5% NaOCl (pH 8.5). The \n\nsoil amended with biosolid increased the Zn extracted in the F4, but the treatment with P \n\ndecreased it. In the F5, extracted with HNO3 + HCl, the treatments reduced the amount of Zn \n\nextracted, except for the soil amended with calcite. In general, the soil amended with P \n\nincreased the Zn extracted in the initial fractions (F1, F2 and F3) and decreased in the most \n\nrecalcitrant fractions (F4 and F5). The treatments with organic compounds (biochar and \n\nbiosolid) increased the extracted Zn in F3 and F4 and decreased in F5. The higher rate of \n\ncalcite did not differ (p &lt;0.05) from the control. However, the lower rates increased the Zn in \n\nF2 and F5 and reduced it in F4. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.

Zinc can form \n\nmononuclear inner-sphere complex at the edges of montmorillonite layers at low [Si]aq around \n\n70\u00b5M and precipitates epitaxially as kerolite at relevant geochemical systems with \n\nconcentrations around 500 \u00b5M.44 Schuwirth et al.45 investigated the speciation of Zn in \n\ndifferent layers in a soil at a former tailings pond of a Zn/Pb/Ag ore mine in the northern \n\nRhineland-Palatinate, Germany and observed that in the superficial layer (4 to 6 cm) the Zn \n\nspecies was predominantly in the form of Zn adsorbed on montmorillonite and Zn-rich \n\nphyllosilicates. \n\nZn-kerolite has been identified in many soils and sediments and is derived from the \n\nin-situ weathering of primary minerals.24,40,46\u201348 The prevalence of the Zn-montmorillonite \n\nstandard in the fit is consistent with the presence of Zn2+ adsorbed on this secondary mineral, \n\nwhich was identified by XRD analysis in our soil sample (Figure S1 in SI). Zinc may be \n\nincorporated or sorbed on the octahedral sheet or a hydroxy-Al sheet in the interlayer region \n\nin the phyllosilicates.49 The other species identified in the unamended soil were Zn-\n\nferrihydrite (24%) and Gahnite (10%).  \n\nZn-ferrihydrite is usually detected with phyllosilicates and frequently occurs as a \n\nbackground species in soil matrices.50,51 Similarly, Gahnite which is a primary mineral formed \n\nmainly in metamorphic high temperature50 environments was identified in soils impacted by \n\nthe dust of smelting activities,42,46 and acid mine drainage sites.50 The positive correlation and \n\npartial correlation with Fe, Si are further evidence of the presence of Zn associated with \n\nphyllosilicates and ferrihydrite that were identified in the unamended soil. Kirpichtchikova et \n\nal. 40 investigated the speciation of Zn in a soil from Pierrelaye plain, a 1,200 ha truck farming \n\narea located about 30 km northwest of Paris, France in an area of urban and industrial \n\nsuburbia. This site was irrigated for a hundred years with untreated sewage water from the \n\ncity of Paris. The predominant Zn species identified at this place were Zn- sorbed ferrihydrite, \n\nZn phosphate, Zn-kerolite, willemite and gahnite. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nThe P-amended soil was the only one that affected the bulk XANES spectrum (Figure \n\n1). This treatment had a fit with ZnO, Zn3(PO4)2, and Zn-LDH. Baker et al.\n52 evaluated the \n\neffect of sources of P, reaction times and distance of the application in the Zn speciation in a \n\ncontaminated soil from an abandoned Pb/Zn smelter near Dearing, KS, USA. The authors \n\nverified the formation of Zn-P and ZnO (Zincite) due to P application in certain treatments. \n\nAlthough our LCF result for the control did not show the fit with Zn-LDH, it could still be \n\npresent in the sample because it is common for Zn-LDH to be identified in soils with pH near \n\n7 and high concentration of Zn.24,25,47,53. The fit with ZnO is not reasonable because this \n\nspecies is more soluble than Zn-kerolite and Zn-montmorillonite.53 However, it could \n\nprobably form due to the decrease in the pH caused by the treatment (Table 1). As pH \n\ndecreases, the solubility of Zn increases.54 In this treatment, we did not observe a fit with Zn-\n\nkerolite, Zn-montmorillonite, and Zn-ferrihydrite. This might be because of the unitability of \n\nZn-kerolite under acid conditions,24 the adsorption of Zn on Montmorillonite that occurs \n\nmainly in the electrostatic form,55 and the adsorption of Zn on Ferrihydrite that is highly pH \n\ndependent.56 \n\nMicro-XRF and \u00b5-XANES confirmed the formation of Zn-P in the P-amended soil \n\n(Figure 2; Table 4). In the \u00b5-XRF image, P is co-localized with Zn, and the significant partial \n\ncorrelation confirmed this association. Micro-XANES showed that the Zn-P species are \n\ndominant in most of the spots analyzed. In a number of these spots, we identified Scholzite \n\n(Zn, Ca-phosphate) which is more stable than Hopeite, but requires Ca to be present for such \n\nformation.57 In a number of \u00b5-XANES spots we also identified Zn-montmorillonite and Zn-\n\nferrihydrite, which indicate that these species are present in the amended soil but are not \n\nsufficiently abundant to be detected by the bulk XANES.  \n\nNickel, Mn, Pb and Fe had the highest partial correlation in the P-amended soil \n\n(Table 5). Iron and Mn are the constituents of the soil that have a high affinity for Zn and \n\nrepresent two possible reactive surfaces with which Zn may interact in the soil environment25. \n\nKarna et al.58 found a high positive correlation between Zn and Pb, Fe, and Mn in mine waste \n\nmaterials. According to Karna et al.58, Zn and Pb could be adsorbed and co-precipitate with \n\nMn and Fe hydr(oxides). Kirpichtchikova et al.40 also reported positive correlation between \n\nZn, and Pb with Fe in ferruginous clay particles. However, Kirpichtchikova et al.40 found no \n\ncorrelation between Zn and Pb with Fe at spots that had low Fe concentration, suggesting that \n\nthe different regions engendered different Zn and Pb species.  \n\nThe Ni \u201chot spot\u201d (spot 4 on Zn \u00b5-XRF map; Figure 2) was co-localized with the Zn \n\n\u201chot spot\u201d. The \u00b5-XANES showed the predominance of Zn-LDH (100%) at this spot where \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNi and Zn could be precipitated on the mineral surface. Nickel can form a Ni-Al layered \n\ndouble hydroxide (LDH) which precipitates upon the reaction of Ni with Montmorillonite, \n\nKaolinite, Pyrophyllite and Gibbsite.  \n\nDesorption kinetics and the chemical extraction confirmed the increased availability of \n\nZn in the P treated soil that received the highest rate (Figure 3). More Zn was desorbed during \n\nthe initial time of the desorption kinetics, which could be inferred from increased Zn extracted \n\nin the first fractions (F1, F2, and F3) of the sequential extraction. However, total Zn desorbed \n\nafter 120 min was almost equal to that of the control. The first Zn species to be released may \n\nbe from ZnO and Zn-phosphate followed by Zn-ferrihydrite and Zn-phyllosilicates. \n\nKirpichtchikova et al.40 performed an EXAFS with linear combination data before and after \n\nthe chemical extraction with EDTA and observed that Zn-phosphate was entirely and \n\nselectively dissolved by EDTA. According to Kirpichtchikova et al.40,  the lower extraction \n\nlevel measured for Zn was due to the Zn phyllosilicate component, which is less soluble than \n\nZn-phosphate and Zn-ferrihydrite.  \n\nLess Zn was desorbed from the samples that received lower rates of P in comparison \n\nto those that were unamended or received a high rate of P (Figure 3; Figure S5 in SI). This \n\nshows that P can be effective in the immobilization of Zn, which has also been demonstrated \n\nby several authors.59,60 The use of the lowest molar ratio, P:M, may be the best option for \n\nimmobilizing Zn in soils with alkaline soil (high pH) and a high concentration of metals. A \n\nlower P rate will have a lower effect on pH and have less risk of eutrophication of \n\ngroundwater and rivers.  \n\nLess Zn was desorbed from the samples that received lower rates of P in comparison \n\nto those that were unamended or received a high rate of P (Figure 3; Figure S5 in SI). This \n\nshows that P can be effective in the immobilization of Zn, which has also been demonstrated \n\nby several authors.59,60 The use of the lowest molar ratio, P:M, may be the best option for \n\nimmobilizing Zn in soils with alkaline soil (high pH) and a high concentration of metals. A \n\nlower P rate will have a lower effect on pH and have less risk of eutrophication of \n\ngroundwater and rivers. \n\nThe treatments with calcite, biosolid and biochar had no effect in the speciation \n\ndetermined by the bulk XANES (Table 3; Figure 1). However, changes were observed in the \n\nresults of sequential extraction and desorption kinetics. The lowest rate of calcite was \n\nprobably better at immobilizing Zn as it had less Ca competing for binding sites with Zn on \n\nthe montmorillonite. Calcite can decrease the availability of Zn due to the formation of Zn-\n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nLDH.61 We observed an increase in Zn in the extraction of the residual fraction, which further \n\nsupports the formation of Zn-LDH. The stability of the Zn-LDH phase has been well \n\ndocumented in the literature.23,24,47 \n\nThe speciation determined by bulk XANES may not have been effective in detecting \n\nmodifications in the Zn species in the organic treatments. Mamindy-Pajany et al.62 used  \n\nMicro-XRF and Micro-XANES to observe an increase in Zn bonded to organic matter and \n\niron oxide in soils amended with biosolids. In our study, the biosolids and biochar increased \n\nthe Zn extracted in the F3 (organic fraction) and in certain of their rates increased the Zn in \n\nthe F4 (iron oxides). In the desorption kinetics, the biochar was more effective in decreasing \n\nthe Zn desorption than biosolid. The greater affinity of biochar might be because of the high \n\nCEC and specific surface area.63\u201365 The biochar can increase the buffering capacity of the \n\nsoil,66 and this may also have contributed to decreased Zn desorption. \n\n \n\n2.5 Environmental Recommendations \n\nThe organic and inorganic amendments utilized in our experiment had different \n\nbehavior patterns according to the different rates applied. Considering only the highest rate of \n\neach amendment, the application of P affected the Zn species determined by bulk XANES. \n\nHowever, the sequential extraction and desorption kinetics results showed us that Zn species \n\nsuch as ZnO could be released easier. Nevertheless, the results from the desorption kinetics \n\nhighlighted that the quarter rate and half rate of P were sufficiently effective to decrease Zn \n\ndesorption. Although our soil was alkaline, the utilization of calcite was effective in \n\ndecreasing Zn desorption on all rates, the quarter rate and half rates being the most effective. \n\nThe organic amendments were also able to reduce the Zn desorption. The rate of 10% of \n\nbiosolid and 5% of biochar were more effective in reducing the Zn desorption than the other \n\nrates. In general, the highest rate did not seem to be the most effective in immobilizing Zn in \n\nthe soil. This information is very important in helping to develop remediation strategies that \n\nprovide a cost-effective and sustainable solution. \n\n \n\n2.6 Supporting Information  \n\n2.6.1 Soil Mineralogical Characterization \n\nIn order to obtain the clay, silt and sand, the sample of the unamended soil was \n\ndispersed using 0.1 M NAOH. The sand fraction was separated by sieving (2 - 0.05 mm) and \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe clay (&lt;2 ?m) was isolated from the silt (0.05 - 0.002 mm) by repeated siphoning of the \n\ndispersed material. The XRD analyses were carried out on a computer-controlled X-ray \n\ndiffractometer (Philips PW 1877) with CuK ? radiation (0.1542 nm) - (40 kV and 40 mA) and \n\na graphite monochromator. The velocity of the goniometer was 0.02\u00ba2? s-1, with a variable \n\nrange between 3 and 60\u00ba2?. The data were analyzed by the PANalytical X Pert HighScore \n\nsoftware program. \n\n \n\n2.6.2 Bulk XANES and Micro-XANES \n\nBulk XANES and Micro-XANES spectra were acquired across the energy range of -\n\n130 to 340 eV and -100 to 200 respectively, relative to the Zn-K edge energy at 9659 eV. For \n\nthe bulk XANES we used a step size of 4 eV in the pre-edge (-130 to -10); 1 eV across the \n\nadsorption edge region (-10 to 50) and 4 eV in the post-edge region (50 to 340) with \n\nacquisition times of 2, 5 and 2 sec, respectively. For the \u00b5-XANES we used a step size of 4 \n\neV in the pre-edge (-100 to -10); 0.5 across the adsorption edge region (-10 to 50) and 2 eV in \n\nthe post-edge region (50 to 200) with acquisition times of 2, 5 and 2 sec, respectively. The \n\nbackgrounds of the bulk XANES and \u00b5-XANES spectra were corrected using a linear pre-\n\nedge function between -70 to -30 eV and -90 to 30 eV a linear or quadratic function between \n\n30 to 130 eV and 80 to 150 eV respectively, and a flattening function in the post-edge region \n\nfor normalization was included. \n\n \n\n2.6.3 Standards Utilized to Perform the Linear Combination Fitting (LCF) \n\nThe LCF was implemented using standards analyzed by us. On the other hand, in the \n\nother studies we utilized the spectra measured in different beamlines provided by researchers. \n\nTable S2 has a list of standards utilized and their references and sources. The standards \n\nobtained by the Alfa Aesar Company, Zn-montmorillonite and Zn-kaolinite were analyzed at \n\nXAFS2 beamline at the LNLS (Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory) and followed the \n\nsame setup utilized for the samples. The Zn adsorbed to montmorillonite and kaolinite was \n\nproduced following the method described in Khaokaew et al.2 \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\nTable S1.

The Pb present on the \n\nsoils may be leached to groundwater, accumulated by plants and animals and then enter in the food \n\nchain. Chemical stabilization is an in-situ remediation that uses inexpensive amendments to reduce \n\ncontaminant availability in polluted soil. Rates of phosphate, calcite, biochar, and biosolids were \n\nevaluated on Pb speciation and mobility. The soil was collected in a Zn mining area located in \n\nVazante, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil and was incubated for 60 days with deionized water at 70% \n\nof the maximum water retention. Chemical and mineralogical characterization, desorption kinetics, \n\nsequential extraction, leaching columns and speciation using X-ray absorption near edge structure \n\n(XANES) were performed. Pb adsorbed on bentonite and on anglesite were the predominant species \n\nin the unamended soil. The treatments with phosphate and calcite transformed part of the Pb species \n\nto pyromorphite. Conversely, in the soil amended with biochar and biosolids, part of Pb species was \n\ntransformed to Pb adsorbed on citrate and PbCl2 in the biosolids. Biosolids and biochar treatments \n\ndecreased the Pb in the residual fraction and increased it in the fraction associated to organic matter \n\n(OM) after the addition of biosolids. These organic amendments increased the desorption kinetics of \n\nPb in all rates applied. Calcite and phosphate increased the Pb extracted in the residual fraction, thus \n\nshowing that more recalcitrant species, such as pyromorphite, were formed. Calcite and phosphate \n\nwere effective to immobilize Pb and to decrease Pb desorption kinetics. The soil amended with \n\nphosphate decreased the Pb leached in the experiment with leaching columns. \n\nKeywords: X-ray absorption near edge structure; Desorption kinetics; Soil pollution; \n\nRemediation of soils  \n\n \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\nLead (Pb) is one of the most hazardous environmental pollutants that affect biological \n\nsystems through exposure to air, water and food sources1. It is also associated with behavioral \n\nabnormalities, neuromuscular weakness, hearing deficits, and impaired cognitive functions.2 \n\nIn Brazil, Pb exposure has been widely recognized as a significant public health problem in \n\nrecent decades. One example is the region of Santo Amaro (state of Bahia where a lead \n\nsmelter operated for 33 years before closing in 1993. It has been reported that some children \n\nliving close to the former plant have high levels of Pb and Cd in their blood.3 \n\nIn situ stabilization of heavy metals in soil using amendments is a promising \n\ntechnology to decrease the risks associated with these elements.4,5 This technique is based on \n\nthe reduction of metal availability and mobility, either by precipitation or increased sorption.6 \n\nThe soil amendments may decrease the metals solubility and thus reduce the detrimental \n\neffects on environmental receptors, such as humans, animals, plants and microorganisms, as \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nwell as water bodies.7 Numerous amendments have been used and tested for in situ \n\nstabilization of Pb in soils, including alkaline materials5,8,9, phosphate9\u201311, biochar12\u201314 and \n\nbiosolids15,16.  \n\nPhosphate compounds increase the immobilization of heavy metals through different \n\nchemical processes, such as adsorption/substitution by phosphorus (P) compounds, P anion-\n\ninduced metal adsorption, and precipitation.17 The soil amended with phosphate may form \n\npyromorphite, which is the most stable Pb form in the environment.18 The formation of this \n\nmineral in a contaminated soil environment reduces Pb bioavailability and improves \n\necosystem health.19 Alkaline materials are also increasingly being accepted as an important \n\namendment to reduce the toxicity of heavy metals in soil.17 These materials enhance the \n\nsorption of heavy metals by increasing the negatively charged sites through reduction in the \n\nH+ concentration17, with the pH increase resulting in the precipitation of these metals.8  \n\nBiochar has been accepted to be used to immobilize heavy metals in the recent years. \n\nThis amendment may change soil properties such as increasing soil buffering capacity, cation \n\nexchange capacity (CEC) and soil pH. Biochar may immobilize Pb by electrostatic \n\ninteractions, precipitation and other reactions according to current research.20\u201322 However, all \n\nbiochar materials may not be suitable for all cases of remediation.17 Feedstock type and \n\npyrolysis condition are the main factors influencing sorption behavior of biochars.23 Some \n\nresearchers have revealed that biochar may increase the mobility of some toxic metals in \n\nsoils.17  \n\nAnother material that may be a suitable amendment is biosolids, the semi-solid \n\nresidues generated during the treatment of domestic sanitary sewage, providing that it \n\ncontains no appreciable amount of heavy metals.24 This amendment contains an abundant \n\namount of nutrients and organic matter that may improve soil biological, physical and \n\nchemical properties.25 Stabilization of heavy metals by biosolids is achieved through \n\ncomplexation adsorption and redox reactions.17 Biosolids has been used to successfully \n\nrestore mine lands for more than 25 years26,27. Despite its beneficial usage, it is necessary to \n\nbe careful with the application of biosolids because it may contain a significant amount of \n\nheavy metals originated mainly from industrial wastewater. The organic compounds may \n\nincrease the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on the soil solution. The DOC can decrease the \n\nsorption of Pb onto soil surfaces due to the competition for binding sites or by the formation \n\nof soluble Pb-organ-complexes.28 \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\nOur research aim was to characterize Pb desorption and speciation from a mine-waste \n\nimpacted soil from Brazil. The investigation was conducted using contaminated soil before \n\nand after the addition of NH4H2PO4, CaCO3, biochar, and biosolids. We used leaching \n\ncolumn, sequential extraction, stirred-flow kinetic approach and X-ray absorption near edge \n\nstructure (XANES) to evaluate the effect of these amendments in the Pb speciation and \n\nmobility.  \n\n \n\n3.2 Materials and Methods \n\n3.2.1 Soil Characterization \n\nThe soil sample was collected in a deactivated Zn mining area located in Vazante, \n\nMinas Gerais State, Brazil (coordinates 17o59\u201911\u2019\u2019S, 46o54\u201927\u201dW). The soil was collected \n\nfrom the surface layer (0-20 cm) and was air dried at room temperature (~25oC) and passed \n\nthrough a 2-mm sieve. The content of soil organic carbon was determined with a Shimadzu \n\nTOC-5000 carbon analyzer. To determine their total (or pseudo-total) concentrations, heavy \n\nmetals in the soil were extracted following the EPA3051a method using a 1:3 HCl/HNO3, v/v \n\nextraction method29, and the metal contents were quantified by inductively couple plasma \n\noptical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Exchangeable ions and pH analyses followed the \n\nmethods of Ingram and Anderson et al.30. XRD was performed in the clay, silt and sand \n\nfractions and bulk soil. XRD was also performed in the clay fraction after treatment with 5M \n\nNaOH31 for concentrating iron oxides and after treatment with sodium dithionite-citrate-\n\nbicarbonate (DCB) for removing the iron oxides.32  Based on the XRD data for different \n\nfractions and chemical treatments, the composition of the soil was qualitatively identified as \n\ngoethite, hematite, kaolinite, gibbsite, muscovite, clinochlore, montmorillonite, and quartz in \n\nthe non-amended soil (Figure 1). \n\n \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. XRD of the sand, silt and clay fractions, and in the clay fraction after chemical \n\ntreatments for remove iron oxides (DCB) and silicates (Oxides). \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Biochar and Biosolids Characterization \n\nSugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) straw was used to produce biochar at the \n\ntemperature of pyrolysis of 450 oC. For more details about the production and characterization \n\nof biochar materials used in the study see Feola Conz et al.33. The biosolids was produced \n\nusing wood chips (eucalyptus) and sewage sludge. It was composted in aerated rows for 60 \n\ndays, in this process, about 2% of dolomitic limestone was added and after composted it was \n\nsieving in mesh with 36 mm2. The sewage sludge was collected at a sewage treatment station \n\nlocated in Jundiai, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil and was composed in the major part by domestic than \n\nindustrial sludge. The pH of biosolids was determined in water extracts (1:5 v/v), CEC was \n\ndetermined following the method described in Sparks34 and organic C amount was determined \n\nby the Walkley and Black method. The total concentrations of heavy metals (Pb, Zn and Cd) \n\nand nutrients (P, K, Ca and Mg) in both organic amendments were determined following the \n\nEPA3051a29 method. \n\n \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\n3.2.3 Amendments and Incubation Time \n\nThe soil was amended individually in triplicate with rates of ammonium phosphate \n\nmonobasic (NH4H2PO4), calcite (CaCO3), biochar and biosolids. The soil was amended with \n\n2.5; 5 and 10% of biochar35 and 5, 10 and 20% of biosolids36. The NH4H2PO4 was applied \n\nevenly to the soil at 0 (control); 0.5 (quarter rate); 1.0 (half rate) and 2:1 (full rate) molar ratio \n\nof P to the sum of Pb, Cd and Zn. These rates were based on the stoichiometry (P:M=3:5) \n\nform of the follow precipitate M5(PO4)3OH (M= sum of Pb, Zn, Cd).\n37   The CaCO3 was \n\napplied evenly to the soil at 0 (control); 0.25 (quarter rate); 0.5 (half rate) and 1:1 (full rate) \n\nmolar ratio of CO3 to the sum of Pb, Cd, and, Zn\n5. The amendments were added and mixed \n\nhomogeneously with the soil and incubated with deionized water at 70% of the maximum \n\nwater retention at 25\u00b12oC in the lab for 60 days. To maintain the humidity, water was added \n\nevery 3 days based on the mass loss of water. \n\n \n\n3.2.4 Bulk XANES \n\nThe Pb-L3-edge XANES analysis was performed on the samples that received the highest \n\nrate of each amendment using the Beamline XAFS2 at LNLS (Brazilian Synchrotron Light \n\nLaboratory) Campinas, Brazil. About 65 mg of each amended soil was ground and mixed \n\nwith 65 mg of boron nitrate for dilution and then pressed as ~5 mm diameter pellets with 1.3 \n\ncm2 of surface area. The Si (111) monochromator energy was calibrated to 13035 eV based \n\non the first inflection point in the L3-edge derivative spectra from a Pb foil. Spectra were \n\ncollected in fluorescence mode using a Canberra 15 element Ge solid state detector.  We \n\ncollected 5 spectra for each sample across the energy range of -150 to 200 eV relative to the \n\nPbL3-edge energy at 13,035 eV, using a step size of 0.5 eV in the pre-edge (-150 to -35), 0.2 \n\neV across the absorption edge region (-35 to 65) and 1 eV in the post-edge region (65 to 200) \n\nwith 1 sec of acquisition time.  \n\nThe XAS scans were aligned, merged and processed using the Athena program, an \n\ninterface to IFEFFIT38,39. The backgrounds of the spectra were corrected using a linear pre-\n\nedge function between -120 and -45 and a linear or quadratic function between 30 and 110 \n\neV, included a flattening function in the post-edge region for normalization. Linear \n\nCombination fitting (LCF) analysis was done across -30 to 80 region using the method \n\ndeveloped by Manceau et al40 to deconvolute different Pb species present and their relative \n\ncontributions to the observed Pb spectrum. \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReference materials for LCF included Pb complexes of Pb-citrate, Pb-acetate, Pb-\n\nfulvic, Pb-humic and adsorbed on bentonite, birnessite, goethite, ferrihydrite, gibbsite, \n\nkaolinite and hematite. We also used the following minerals: pyromorphite, galena, litharge, \n\ncerussite, hydrocerussite, chloropyromorphite, anglesite, hydroxypyromorphite. The \n\nreferences of PbO, PbCl2, PbCO3, PbO2, Pb(NO3)2 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. \n\n \n\n3.2.5 Desorption Kinetics \n\nA Stirred-flow reactor equipped with a piston displacement pump designed for use in \n\nan HPLC system was used to conduct the Pb desorption kinetics. The mass of the amended \n\nsoils used was 200 mg placed in a 12 mL stirred-flow chamber (Figure 2). A Mehlich-3 \n\n(0.2M CH3COOH + 0.25M NH4NO3 + 0.013M HNO3 + 0.015M NH4F + 0.001M EDTA) \n\nsolution was used as a desorption agent. A 25-mm diameter cellulose filter membrane with a \n\n0.45 \u00b5m pore size was used in the reaction chamber. The suspension in the reactor was stirred \n\nat 300 rpm and the liquid portion of it was flowed through the filter in the chamber at a rate of \n\n1 mL min-1. The effluent was collected by a fraction collector at 2 min intervals and the \n\nconcentration of Pb was quantified by ICP-OES. The amount of Pb desorbed was calculated \n\naccording to Yin et al.41 and plotted in cumulative Pb desorption percentages. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Schematic diagram of operation for stirred flow method \n\n \n\n3.2.6 Sequential Extraction \n\nThe sequential extraction was performed according to the procedure developed by \n\nSilveira et al.42 The original method counts on seven fractions, but in the present study we \n\nextracted sequentially with 0.1 M CaCl2, 1 M NaOAC (pH 5), NaOCl (pH 8.5), and 0.2M \n\noxalic acid + 0.2M NH4 oxalate (pH 3); and the residual was digested by EPA3051a method\n42 \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\nto target Pb in readily exchangeable (F1), carbonate forms (F2), organic-matter bound (F3), \n\niron-oxides bound (F4), and residual (F5), respectively. \n\n \n\n3.2.7 Leaching Column \n\nThe leaching experiment was conducted using soil from the mine area and amended it \n\nwith different rates of P. Four 5.05-cm diameter (20 cm2 cross sectional area) columns made \n\nfrom polycarbonate, washed with acid and rinsed with distilled water were prepared for the \n\nstudy.  Twenty-six g of air dried soil was packed at a bulk density of 1.3 g cm-3 (1 cm thick) \n\nover a 3-cm thick layer of washed sand in each column (Figure 3).  Another 3-cm thick layer \n\nof washed sand was then packed on top of the soil before placing a cap with an outlet on top. \n\nAssuming a particle density of 2.65 g cm-3, one pore volume for the soil columns was \n\napproximately 10.1 cm3. Deionized water, adjusted to pH of 4.3 with 0.001 M HNO3, was \n\npumped through the column at a rate of approximately 10 mL/h. We selected this pH based on \n\na previous study that determined the chemical characteristics of the rainwater at a \n\nsoutheastern part of Brazil43.  A total of 670 pore volumes of the solution was passed through \n\neach column and the outflow was collected on a fraction collector in 14-15 mL increments. \n\nWe determined the concentration of Pb by ICP-MS and measured the pH in the outflow \n\nsamples to establish breakthrough curves.    \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Diagram of the leaching column apparatus. \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3 Results \n\n3.3.1 Soil, Biochar and Biosolids Characterization \n\nThe amount of Pb, Zn and Cd in the soil samples were considered hazardous because \n\ntheir concentrations exceeded the intervention values adopted by the Environmental Agency \n\nof the State of S\u00e3o Paulo44 for residential and industrial areas (Table 1). The treatment with \n\nphosphate and biosolids reduced the pH by 2 and 0.5 units, respectively. The other \n\namendments did not affect the pH. Soil carbon (C) contents were increased more in the \n\nbiochar than biosolids treatment. The highest rate of phosphate increased the exchangeable P \n\nby almost 100 times and the calcite amendment increased the Ca content by 60 to 90%.  \n\n \n\nTable 1.

The LCF-XANES fitted \n\nresults described the samples data quite well. The primary Pb species in the non-amended soil \n\nwere Pb-bentonite (75%) and Anglesite (PbSO4) (25%) (Table 3). The soil amended with \n\nphosphate and calcite had an LCF with the same species as the non-amended soil, plus the \n\nLCF with pyromorphite. The best fit combination for phosphate and calcite amended soil \n\nwere 41-54% Pb-bentonite, 30-16% Anglesite, and 29-30% pyromorphite.  \n\nThe formation of pyromorphite due the treatment with phosphate compounds has \n\nbeen well documented in the literature.19,45,46 The soil amended with the biochar and biosolids \n\nalso had a fit with Pb-bentonite (66 and 38%, respectively), and the Pb-citrate (22 and 48%, \n\nrespectively). However, the biosolids did not have a fit with anglesite but had a fit with PbCl2 \n\n(14%).The Pb L3-edge XANES spectra of the references that had a fit with our soil samples \n\nare show in Figure 5. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.

The data indicated a rapid desorption of Pb in the non-amended soil within the first \n\n30 min. The cumulative desorption at 30min was 6% and after 2 h was 10%. \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\nThe inorganic amendments (phosphate and calcite) were efficient in decreasing Pb \n\nkinetics desorption than organic amendments (biosolids and biochar). The phosphate \n\namendment was the most effective treatment to decrease Pb desorption. While the lowest P \n\namendment had the lowest desorption (5% after 2 h), the half and full rate were also effective \n\nin reducing Pb desorption (up to 8% after 2 h).  The calcite amendment was also effective in \n\nreducing Pb desorption, but without any appreciable difference among calcite rates, with a \n\ncumulative Pb desorption around 8%. \n\nThe biochar and biosolids amendments were not effective in decreasing the \n\ndesorption kinetics of Pb.  Biosolids increased the desorption of Pb in the early times more \n\nthan biochar. However, both amendments had very similar Pb cumulative desorption after 2 h. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6. Cumulative Pb desorption (%) Mehlich-3 in the mining soil amended with rates of \n\nphosphate, calcite biochar and biosolids. \n\n \n\n3.3.4 Sequential Extraction \n\nThe sequential extractions of Pb after amendment application with rates of phosphate, \n\ncalcite, biosolids and biochar are given in Figure 7. No exchangeable fraction - F1 - (extracted \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nwith 0.1 M CaCl2) was detected in both non-amended and amended soils. The soil amended \n\nwith rates of P and the highest rate of calcite and biochar did not release appreciable amounts \n\nof Pb when extracted with NaOAC (pH 5) (F2 treatment) designed to extract the species \n\nassociated with carbonates. Biochar and biosolids were the only amendments that increased \n\nthe Pb in the F3 treatment (extracted with 5% NaOCl (pH 8.5)) designed to extract species \n\nassociated with organic matter.  \n\nIn the non-amended soil and amended with calcite and phosphate, we did not detect a \n\nmeasurable amount of Pb in the F3 treatment. In the F4 treatment (extracted with 0.2M oxalic \n\nacid + 0.2M NH4 oxalate (pH 3)), to extract the Pb bound to iron oxides, all rates of biosolids \n\nand the half rate and quarter rate of calcite decreased the exchangeable Pb. The biochar did \n\nnot change and the half rate of phosphate decreased the Pb in the F4 treatment. The soil \n\namended with rates of calcite and phosphate increased the Pb in the residual fraction (F5) \n\nwhile the biochar and biosolids had an opposite effect. \n\nSanderson et al 49 evaluated the effect of P in a shooting range soils contaminated by \n\nPb and observed by sequential extraction a decrease in the Pb extracted in the F1 \n\n(exchangeable) and an increase in the residual fraction due to P treatment.  A similar outcome \n\nwas reported by Su et al. 48  for P addition to an anthropogenic contaminated soil \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7. Relative distributions of Pb among the soil fractions as a function of treatments and \n\nrates. F1= exchangeable, F2= carbonate-associated, F3 = organic-matter associated. F4 = \n\noxide, and F5 = residual (most strongly bound). Columns followed by the same letter in each \n\nfraction do not differ (p &lt;0.05) by Tukey test. \n\n \n\n3.3.5 Leaching Column \n\nThe concentration of Pb (\u00b5mol) and the pH of the leachate varied as a function of the \n\nrate of phosphate (Figure 8). The first pore volume of leachate that passed through the column \n\nstarted with an acidic pH for all rates of phosphate applied. However, as more water passed \n\nthrough the column the pH began to increase before decreasing. The highest rate of P had more \n\nbuffering capacity than the other rates as well as the non-amended soil.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 8. pH of the leachate (A) and the concentration of Pb on the leachate (B) for the rates \n\nof phosphate applied in the mining soil. \n\n \n\nThe full rate of P, we detected a low Pb concentration in all collected outflow samples. \n\nThe half rate and quarter rate of P had less buffering capacity than the non-amended soil. These \n\nphosphate rates had more Pb leached during the initial period of leaching. However, after 150 \n\npore volumes, these P rates had less Pb leached than the non-amended soil. \n\n \n\n3.4 Discussion \n\nThe LCF included the Pb-bentonite (75%), the major species in the non-amended \n\nsoil, followed by Anglesite (25%). The abundance of Pb-bentonite in the LCF is in agreement \n\nwith XRD results (Figure 1). Clay minerals such as montmorillonite can be effective in \n\nbinding heavy metals because they have large specific surface area and high CEC. The \n\nadsorption of heavy metals in this mineral can occur by outer-sphere adsorption, which occurs \n\nprimarily on the basal planes existing in the interlayer of the clay minerals; and inner-sphere \n\nadsorption, which occurs at the amphoteric ligand sites existing on the edges of clay \n\nminerals.47  \n\nLead ions in bentonite may be incorporated in the positions of the inner-sphere \n\ncomplex by replacing some aluminum ions in the octahedral sites.48 Lead adsorbed to \n\nbentonite and the anglesite may have been formed due to the oxidation of galena that was \n\npresent in the soil environment. The formation of anglesite due to galena oxidation has \n\nalready been well documented in the literature49-50, and its presence in the soil of the Vazante \n\nregion has already been reported.51-52 \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\nThe LCF in the samples amended with phosphate showed that a substantial part of \n\nthe Pb-bentonite was transformed in pyromorphite with a smaller amount converted to \n\nanglesite (Table 3). These results are important because pyromorphite (Pb5(PO4)3Cl) has at \n\nleast 44 orders of magnitude smaller solubility than galena (PbS), anglesite (PbSO4), cerrusite \n\n(PbCO3), and litharge (PbO), which are common Pb minerals in contaminated soils.\n53,54 The \n\npresence of pyromorphite in the amended soil as detected by LCF was expected due to the \n\nhigh phosphate exchangeable and the decrease of the pH of the soil (Table 1).  \n\nThe formation of pyromorphite is thermodynamically favored when H3PO4\n0 and \n\nH2PO4\n- are present; therefore, a lower soil pH is necessary to be established to support the \n\nconversion of soil Pb to pyromorphite.55 According to Sanderson et al.9 for the pyromorphite \n\nformation it is necessary to have solubilization of Pb from an existing source and sufficient \n\namount of chloride. However, when P and Cl are not in sufficient amount other species such \n\nas Pb phosphate (Pb3(PO4)2 or PbHPO4) and hydroxylpyromorphite are expected to form.  \n\nThe LCF of the soil amended with calcite included Pb-bentonite (54%), Anglesite \n\n(16%) and Pyromorphite (30%), and the soil amended with phosphate the treatment with \n\ncalcite also had substantial amount of pyromorphite formation (Table 3). This treatment \n\nresulted in a minor change in pH because our soil was already alkaline. On the other hand, the \n\nionic strength of the soil solution increased and favored to increase the exchangeable P (Table \n\n1) probably because of the competition for binding sites with CO3\n2-. However, Pb that was \n\nadsorbed to the outer-sphere complex may have been desorbed from the bentonite into the soil \n\nsolution because of the excess of Ca2+. Lead can exchange on the basal planes and form inner-\n\nsphere surface complexation at the edge sites on 2:1 phyllosilicate depending on the ionic \n\nstrength and pH.56   High ionic strength inhibits the outer-sphere adsorption of Pb on the basal \n\nplanes of montmorillonite.56 As we previously discussed, the presence of P and Pb in the soil \n\nsolution facilitates the formation of pyromorphite. High pH of the soil may favor the \n\nprecipitation of Pb as phosphate, hydroxides and carbonates, as well.57 \n\nThe results of sequential extraction and desorption kinetics give some useful insight \n\ninto the immobilization of Pb in the soil and confirm their effectiveness (Figures 6 and 7). Pb \n\nextracted in the carbonate fraction decreased and was transferred to the residual fraction, \n\nindicating the presence of more recalcitrant species that is an evidence of the pyromorphite \n\nformation. Cao et al.11 also reported a decrease in the Pb extracted in the carbonate fraction \n\nand an increase in the residual fraction in a soil amended with phosphate. Sanderson et al.58 \n\nevaluated the effect of P in a shooting range soils contaminated by Pb and observed a \n\ndecrease in the Pb extracted in the exchangeable and an increase in the residual fraction due to \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nP treatment. A similar outcome was reported by Su et al.59  after P addition in an \n\nanthropogenic contaminated soil. In the calcite treatment, more Pb was found in the residual \n\nfractions.  \n\nThe immobilization of Pb due the formation of pyromorphite is supported by the \n\ndesorption kinetics results where the desorption of Pb decreased in all rates of phosphate and \n\ncalcite. It is important to note that the rates of calcite did not have an appreciable impact on \n\nthe desorption kinetics. On the other hand, the soil amended with phosphate had different \n\namounts of Pb desorbed between the rates applied. This information is important to evaluate \n\nlow-cost remediation strategies. \n\nThe phosphate treatment decreased the pH of the outflow (leachate) initially, but the \n\nleachate pH began to increase as more water passed through the column before decreasing \n\nagain (Figure 8). The initial decrease of pH probably happened because of the dissociation of \n\nNH4\n+ and H2PO4\n\n- in the solution provided by the NH4H2PO4 that was used as a source of \n\nphosphate. The pH increased when these components began to be leached.  \n\nThe highest rate of P had a higher buffer capacity probably because not all of the \n\nNH4H2PO4 had reacted with soil. The half rate and quarter rates increased the leaching of Pb \n\nin the initial leaching probably due to the mineral solubilization. The acidity generated by the \n\nphosphate may cause the dissolution of the compounds of Fe, Al, Mn, organic matter and \n\ncarbonates.60  The use of soluble P source for amending soils increases the soil dissolved \n\norganic carbon concentration, thereby increasing Pb mobility.61 Although the half and quarter \n\nrates resulted in a higher initial leaching, these treatments in long-term may be effective to \n\ndecrease the Pb mobility. Su et al.59 evaluated the effect of the addition of sources of P with \n\noxalic acid in different incubation times in a soil contaminated anthropogenically by Pb. The \n\nauthors observed a decrease in the Pb leaching in all treatments with P and less Pb was \n\nleached in the highest times of incubation. \n\nConversely to the inorganic amendments (phosphate and calcite), the organic \n\namendments (biochar and biosolids) made the Pb more available in the soil. The effectiveness \n\nof biochar and biosolids to immobilize Pb in contaminated soil is well documented 62\u201367. \n\nThese amendments can increase immobilization of heavy metals due to different chemical \n\nprocess, such as adsorption, complexation and precipitation.17 However, in our study, these \n\namendments increased the desorption kinetics of Pb for all rates of biochar and biosolids, and \n\nwe also verified a decrease in the residual fraction (F5) that is responsible for the most stable \n\nspecies in the soil.  \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\nBiochar and biosolids had a LCF with Pb-citrate indicating that part of Pb might be \n\nbound with organic groups. This result agrees with the sequential extraction in which the Pb \n\nextracted in the fraction 3 (organic matter bound) increased for both treatments. Scheckel et \n\nal.68 evaluated the effect of amendments on the Pb speciation in a soil contaminated by \n\nsmelter activities. They observed that the treatment with 10% of biosolids decreased the LCF \n\nwith anglesite (32 to 12%) and galena (21 to 0%), and increased the LCF with Pb bound to \n\norganic matter (37 to 60%). They also reported that the treatment with rock phosphate and \n\ntriple superphosphate used as source of P increased the LCF with Pyromorphite. \n\nLead may have been complexed by the soluble organic ligands originating from the \n\nbiochar and biosolids and this may have increased your desorption. Lead has the ability to \n\nform a complex compound with the dissolved organic carbon.69  The formation of soluble \n\ncomplexes with oxygen-containing functional groups of dissolved organic matter can increase \n\nthe mobility of metals like Pb and Cu.70 Strawn and Sparks62 evaluated the kinetic adsorption \n\nof Pb in a soil in which  organic matter (SOM) was removed. They observed that the soil \n\nwithout SOM sorbed more Pb than the untreated soil. The SOM consists of a large polymer, \n\nand the diffusion to the sites on the interior of the SOM molecule limit the sorption process.62 \n\n \n\n3.5 Environmental Recommendations  \n\nApplication of P and calcite for chemical stabilization of Pb in a contaminated soil \n\nresulted in a significant formation of pyromorphite. These amendments decreased the \n\ndesorption kinetics and formed more recalcitrant species of Pb. The highest rate of each \n\ntreatment did not always result in more Pb immobilized. Thus, for remediation, a better option \n\nmay be to start with the lowest rate, which may provide a more cost-effective and sustainable \n\nsolution. In our study, biochar and biosolids increased the mobilization of Pb. However, the \n\nchemical characteristics and the production of these amendments can affect their \n\neffectiveness. The soil characteristics and the incubation time also should be considered. In \n\nfuture studies, it is important to verify the long-term effects of these amendments. \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n(1)  Patra, R. C.; Rautray, A. K.; Swarup, D.

In situ \n\nremediation is a promissory and low-cost strategy for immobilizing heavy metals in soil. This \n\ntechnique is based on the utilization of soil amendments designed to immobilize heavy metals in \n\nsoil, thus decreasing their risks. In this study, Cd release kinetics (by the stirred flow method) and \n\nsequential extraction were performed in a soil under forest and in a soil near the forest from a \n\nmining area as a function of the application of rates of biochar, phosphate, calcite, and biosolids. \n\nBiochar and biosolids were more effective to decrease the desorption kinetics of Cd in the forest \n\nsoil than in the mine soil. Both treatments increased the Cd associated to organic matter (OM), and \n\nit suggests that part of the Cd was immobilized on the organic compounds provided by these \n\namendments.  The desorption kinetics of Cd in both soils was also decreased in samples amended \n\nwith phosphate. A decrease in the fraction associated to carbonate and an increase in the OM \n\nfraction were observed, suggesting that the P could increase the negative charge on the organic \n\ncompounds. The leaching column performed in the mine showed that the quarter rate and a half rate \n\nof P increased the leaching of Cd, while the highest rate decreased Cd leaching when compared \n\nwith the unamended soil. The treatment with calcite was more effective to decreased Cd desorption \n\nkinetics in the mine soil at the initial times (30 min), while the same was observed in the forest soil \n\nonly at 120 min. In both soils, the Cd associated to OM increased after the addition of calcite as it \n\ncould increase the negative charge on the organic matter. \n\nKeywords: Desorption kinetics; In-situ remediation of soils; Soil pollution; Sequential \n\nextraction \n \n\n4.1 Introduction \n\nBetween 1973 and 2016, the world mine production of Cd increased from 17,200 to \n\n23,000 tonnages, an increase of ~34%.1,2 The contamination of soil by heavy metals due to \n\nmining activities is pretty common in different places in the world.3 High Cd contents up to \n\n360 mg kg-1 have been found in soils at Zn-Pb mine sites.4  In addition to mining activities, \n\nthe soil can have an input of heavy metals by atmospheric deposition of aerosol particles,5 \n\ndirect applications of agricultural fertilizers,6 agrichemical7 and organic materials, such as \n\nbiosolids8 and livestock manures.9   \n\nThe soil contamination by Cd is a global environmental concern that results in \n\necological hazards and human health and also implies huge economic costs with respect to \n\nreclamation and restoration.10 Cadmium is a heavy metal that can cause several problems in \n\nthe human health, such as cancer,11 damages on the kidney,12 reproductive system,13 \n\nrespiratory system,14 and skeletal system.15 The consumption of crops contaminated by Cd \n\ncorrespond with >90% of the human exposure in the general population and most of dietary \n\nCd is derived from soil via uptake in main food items, i.e. potatoes or cereals.3 The other \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\npaths to heavy metals exposure may be direct ingestion or contact with contaminated soil and \n\ndrinking of contaminated ground water.16 \n\nThe scientific community is focused to develop of soil remediation technologies \n\nbecause of the implications of the contaminated soils on animal and human health.17 \n\nConventional technologies for soil remediation, i.e., landfilling and excavation, are often \n\nexpansive and environmentally unfeasible, as compared to alternative options. The utilization \n\nof amendments for metal immobilization/solidification are cost effective and less \n\nenvironmentally disruptive.18,19 The advantage of immobilize heavy metals in soil by \n\namendments are (i) it is low invasive, (ii) simplicity and rapidity, (iii) relatively inexpensive, \n\n(iv) small amount of wastes are produced, and (vi) covers a broad spectrum of inorganic \n\npollutants.20 \n\nMany amendments, such as phosphate,21 alkaline materials,22 biochar,23 and \n\nbiosolids24 have been used to immobilize Cd in soil and decrease its environmental risks. The \n\namendments may immobilize the heavy metals due to adsorption, complexation, and \n\nprecipitation reactions, thus making them unavailable for human and plant uptake and \n\nleaching to groundwater.25 \n\nMany soil chemical processes are time dependent, and evaluation of desorption \n\nkinetics is crucial for understanding the mobility and availability of metals in contaminated \n\nsoils after the addition of amendments. By means of kinetics desorption it is possible to \n\ndetermine the quantities of metal available with greater and slower speed, as well as the \n\ncontent not available, and can, therefore, help in predicting its fate over the time.26\u201328 For \n\nexample, Ren et al.29 evaluated the desorption kinetics of Cd, Zn, and Pb in a soil from a \n\nmining area and observed that the desorption of Cd had already reached equilibrium after \n\nthree days of reaction, while Pb and Zn only reached after twelve days. According to Ren et \n\nal.29 , Cd was associated with low-affinity binding sites, while Pb and Zn were mainly \n\nassociated with more specific forms of binding. \n\nOur research aim was to evaluate if the addition of phosphate, calcite, biochar, and \n\nbiosolids were able to immobilize the Cd in a mine-waste impacted soil from Brazil. Leaching \n\ncolumn, sequential extraction, and stirred-flow kinetic approaches were performed to evaluate \n\nthe effect of these amendments on Cd mobility.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \n\n4.2 Materials and Methods \n\n4.2.1 Characterization of Soil, Biochar and Biosolids \n\nThe soil samples were collected from the surface layer (0-20 cm) in a deactivated Zn \n\nmining area and a forest close to the mining area both located in Vazante Minas Gerais, Brazil \n\n(close to geographic coordinates 17o59\u201911\u2019\u2019S, 46o54\u201927\u201d W). The samples were air dried at \n\nroom temperature (~25oC) and passed through a 2-mm sieve. The content of soil organic \n\ncarbon was determined with a Shimadzu TOC-5000 carbon analyzer. The total concentration \n\nof heavy metals in the soils were extracted following the EPA3051a30 method using a 1:3 \n\nHCl/HNO3, and the metal contents were quantified by inductive couple plasma optical \n\nemission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The content of exchangeable ions and pH analyses \n\nfollowed the methods of Ingram and Anderson.31 \n\nThe chemical characteristics of the biochar and biosolids are in the Table 1. The \n\nbiochar was produced using sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) straw at the temperature of \n\npyrolysis of 450 oC. For more information about the production and characterization of \n\nbiochar see Feola Conz et al.32. The biosolids was produced from the composting of wood \n\nchips (eucalyptus) and sewage sludge. The composting took place in aerated rows for 60 days \n\nand was sieving in mesh with 36 mm2 holes. In the composting process, about 2% of \n\ndolomitic limestone was added to the sludge. The sewage sludge was collected at a sewage \n\ntreatment station located in Jundiai, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil and was composed in the major part by \n\ndomestic than industrial sludge. The pH of biosolids was determined in water extracts (1:5 \n\nv/v), CEC was determined following the method described by Sparks33 and the organic C \n\ncontent was determined by the Walkley and Black method. The metal (Cd, Zn and Pb) and \n\nnutrients (P, K, Ca and Mg) concentration in the biochar and biosolids were determined \n\nfollowing the EPA3051a30 method. \n\n \n\n4.2.2 Amendments and Incubation Time \n\nIn triplicate the soils were amended individually with rates of ammonium phosphate \n\nmonobasic (NH4H2PO4), calcite (CaCO3), biochar and biosolids. The soils were amended \n\nwith 2.5; 5 and 10% of biochar34 and 5, 10 and 20% of biosolids.35 The rate of NH4H2PO4 and \n\nCaCO3 were estimated by the concentration of Cd, Zn and Pb in the soil and was designed to \n\npromote the precipitation of stable forms. The NH4H2PO4 was applied evenly to the soil at 0 \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(control); 0.5 (quarter rate); 1.0 (half rate) and 2:1 (full rate) molar ratio of P to the sum of Cd, \n\nZn and Pb. These rates were based on the stoichiometry (P:M =3:5) form of the follow \n\nprecipitate M5(PO4)3OH (M= sum of Zn, Pb and Cd).\n36 Calcite (CaCO3) was applied evenly \n\nto the soil at 0 (control); 0.25 (quarter rate); 0.5 (half rate) and 1:1 (full rate) molar ratio of \n\nCaCO3 to the sum of Cd, Zn and Pb.\n37 The amendments were added and mixed \n\nhomogeneously with the soil and incubated with deionized water at 70% of the maximum \n\nwater retention at 25\u00b12oC in the lab for 60 days. To maintain the humidity, water was added \n\nevery 3 days based on the mass loss of water. \n\n \n\n4.2.3 Desorption Kinetics \n\nThe desorption kinetics of Cd was performed using a stirred-flow reactor equipped \n\nwith a pistol displacement pump designed for use in a HPLC system. The stirred-flow \n\nchamber was 12 mL of volume and 200 mg of mass of amended soil was used to perform the \n\ndesorption (Figure 1). The solution used was Mehlich-3 (0.2M CH3COOH + \n\n0.25M NH4NO3 + 0.013M HNO3 + 0.015M NH4F + 0.001M EDTA) as a desorption agent. In \n\nthe reactor chamber was used a 25-mm diameter cellulose filter membrane with 0.45 \u00b5m pore \n\nsize. The suspension in the reactor was stirred at 300 rpm and the liquid portion of it was \n\nflowed through the filter in the chamber at a rate of 1 mL min-1. The effluent was collected by \n\na fraction collector at 2 min intervals and the concentration of Cd was quantified by ICP-OES. \n\nThe amount of Cd desorbed was calculated according to Yin et al.38 and plotted in cumulative \n\nCd desorption percentages. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of operation for stirred flow method \n\n \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\n4.2.4 Sequential Extraction \n\nThe sequential extraction of the amended soils was done according to the procedure \n\ndeveloped by Silveira et al.39. The original method counts on seven fractions, but the in \n\npresent study we extracted sequentially with 0.1 M CaCl2 for readily exchangeable (F1); 1 M \n\nNaOAC (pH 5) for carbonates forms (F2); NaOCl (pH 8.5) for organic-matter bound (F3); \n\n0.2M oxalic acid + 0.2M NH4 oxalate (pH 3) for iron-oxides bound (F4); the residual (F5) \n\nwas determined by digestion according to EPA3051a method using a 1:3 HCl/HNO3\n30\n\n . The \n\nCd in each fraction was quantified by ICP-OES. \n\n \n\n4.2.5 Leaching Column \n\nThe leaching experiment was conducted using only the soil from the mine area \n\namended it with different rates of P. For this study, we used four 5.05-cm diameter (20 cm2 \n\ncross sectional area) columns made from polycarbonate that was previously washed with acid \n\nand rinsed with distilled water. Twenty-six g of air-dried soil was packed at a bulk density of \n\n1.3 g cm-3 (1 cm thick) between a 3-cm thick layer of washed sand on the top and on the \n\nbottom (Figure 2). One pore volume for the soil columns was approximately 10.1 cm3, \n\nassuming a particle density of 2.65 g cm-3. Deionized water, adjusted to pH of 4.3 with 0.001 \n\nM HNO3, was pumped through the column at a rate of approximately 10 mL h\n-1. The pH of \n\nthe solution was based on a previous study that determined the chemical characteristics of the \n\nrainwater at a southeastern part of Brazil.40 A total of 670 pore volumes of the solution was \n\npassed through each column and the outflow was collected on a fraction collector in 14-15 \n\nmL increments. We determined the concentration of Cd by ICP-MS and measured the pH in \n\nthe outflow samples to establish breakthrough curves. \n\n \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Diagram of the leaching column apparatus. \n\n \n\n4.3 Results and Discussion \n\n4.3.1 Effects of the Amendments on the Soil Properties  \n\nThe concentration of Cd, Zn and Cd in the non-amended and amended soils were \n\nconsidered hazardous because their amount exceeded the intervention values adopted by the \n\nEnvironmental Agency of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil)41 for residential and industrial areas \n\n(Table 1 and 2). However, the amendments did not affect the heavy metal concentration but \n\naffected the others chemical properties of the soils.  \n\nThe treatment with rates of P decreased the pH and increased the exchangeable P of \n\nthe soils. These changes, were more evident in the mine soil because the amount of P applied \n\nwas higher. According to Sposito42 ammonium-based fertilizers can result in soil \n\nacidification. The phosphoric acid released by P fertilizers also could decrease the soil pH.43 \n\nThe decreasing in the pH due to MAP application already was reported in the literature.44 \n\nCalcite treatment caused a slight increase in the soil pH and also increased the amount of Ca \n\nexchangeable. The calcite increases the pH due to the neutralization of H+ by the OH- released \n\nin the reaction of the calcite on the soil (equation 1, 2 and 3). \n\n(1) ????3 + ?2? ?  ??\n+2 + ???3\n\n? + ??? \n\n(2) ???3\n? +  ?+  ?  ?2??3 ?  ?2? + ??2 ? \n\n(3) ??? +  ?+  ?  ?2?  \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\nTable 1.

Biochar had ~4.5 times more C than biosolids. Although the biochar and biosolids were \n\nalkaline (Table 3) they had different behavior on the pH in the soil from the forest and from \n\nmine area. The Biochar decreased the pH of the forest soil and did not have a significant \n\neffect on the mine soil. On the other hand, biosolids increased a little the pH of the forest and \n\ndecreased the pH of the mine probably because your pH was smaller than mine soil. The pH \n\nmay decreased due to the oxidation of C to form acidic carboxyl groups.45 The forest soil \n\nprobably had more microbial activities and it could favor the biochar degradation resulting in \n\nthe decreasing the soil pH. The application of biochar in soil increase the microbial population \n\nand microbial activity in soils46,47 and biochar may accelerate the decomposition of soil native \n\nC by improving microbial populations. 48,49  \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1.

The results of desorption \n\nkinetics, sequential extraction, and leaching columns are presented in Fig 3 to 7. The results \n\nof desorption kinetics showed us that the desorption of Cd decreased due to rates of \n\nPhosphate. This decrease was more pronounced in the first 30 min for the mine soil whereas \n\nthe forest soil was after 120 min (Figure 3 and 4). In the first 30 minutes, the amount of Cd \n\ndesorbed in the mine soil ranged from 9.2 to 8.3% for rates of P, while the untreated soil was \n\n11.5%. However, this difference decreased after 120 minutes for some rates of P.  \n\nAt 120 min, the amount desorbed in the forest soil ranged from 9.8 to 8.1% for rates \n\nof P while it was 9.5% in the untreated soil. The efficiency of phosphate compounds to \n\nimmobilize Cd in soils is well documented in the literature.37,50,51. Basta et al.37 investigated \n\nthe effect of P in the immobilization of Cd in a soil collected in a smelter site in Northeastern \n\nOklahoma, USA. They observed a reduction of 53% and 94% on the elution of Cd due to the \n\ntreatment with rock phosphate and diammonium phosphate, respectively. Based on the use of \n\ngeochemical computer speciation modeling, Basta et al.37 concluded that the Cd phosphate \n\nwas the most probable solid phase formed after diammonium phosphate treatment.  \n\nPhosphate increase the immobilization in soils through various chemical process such \n\nas direct adsorption/substitution by P compounds, P anion-induced metal adsorption and \n\nprecipitation.52 The P may improve the soil negative surface charge, and it increases Cd \n\nsorption.53 Adhikori and Singh54 suggested the following sorption mechanisms resulted from \n\nP application: (i) precipitation of Cd as Cd3(PO4)2, (ii) sorption of Cd-P complexes, (iii) \n\nsurface complex formation of Cd onto sorbed P, and (iv) P-induced Cd sorption. Cadmium \n\nphosphate [Cd3(PO4)2] may control Cd solubility in soils before immobilization treatments.\n55  \n\n \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Cumulative Cd desorption (%) Mehlich-3 in the mining area amended with \n\nphosphate, calcite, biochar and biosolids in different rates. \n\n \n\nCadmium in the forest soil was distributed almost 100% in the F4 (bounded to iron \n\noxides) while the most part the mine soil was in the F2 (carbonate forms) and F3 (organic \n\nmatter bound) (Figure 5 and 6). The treatment with rates of P did not have a significant effect \n\n(p &lt;0.05) in the forest, but this treatment decreased the Cd in the F2 and increased in the F3 \n\nin the mine soil. The increase of the Cd in the F3 could be due to the increase in the negative \n\ncharge in the minerals or organic compounds.  \n\nThe adsorption of specifically ligands such as H2PO4\n- and HPO4\n\n2- in strongly \n\nweathered and variable charge soils can induce Cd (II) adsorption through increased negative \n\nsurface charge.56,57 On the other hand, Wang et al.58 evaluated the effectiveness of \n\namendments to immobilize heavy metals in a contaminated soil form a crop land in the \n\nvicinity of a galvanized factory in Fuyang district, China, and observed that the soil amended \n\nwith triple superphosphate increased the Cd bound to iron-manganese oxides fraction and \n\ndecreased in the exchangeable fraction. The different results were probably because of \n\ndifferences in the sequential extraction methods, the sources of contamination, the soil \n\ncharacteristics and the source of P used as amendments. \n\n\n\n84 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4. Cumulative Cd desorption after extraction with Mehlich-3 solution in the forest \n\namended with phosphate, calcite, biochar and biosolids ate different rates. \n\n \n\nThe amount of Cd in the leached increased in the quarter rate and half rate of P \n\n(Figure 7). However, the full rate leached less Cd than unamended soil. The reduction of Cd \n\nadsorption in presence of P in soils is attributed to the formation of Cd-P complexes in \n\nsolution.59 The pH of the leached in the all rates of P started around 6.5 and increased until 7.4 \n\nwhen more water passed through the column. The low pH in the initial leaching was probably \n\ndue to the dissociation of NH4\n+ and H2PO4\n\n- in the solution provided by the NH4H2PO4 used as \n\na source of P. Fertilizers with high NH4\n+ amounts reduce the soil pH42 and may increase the \n\ncontent of Cd on the soil solution.53 The treatments that the faster pH decreases were the same \n\nwith the highest Cd releases. In other words, the rate of quarter of P decreased more the pH \n\nand increased Cd release in comparison with the other rates. The increase of Cd concentration \n\non the solution could be associated with the decrease in the soil pH and presumably with the \n\ndesorption of Cd from exchange sites on soil colloids.60 \n\n \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n\n4.3.2.2 Calcite  \n\nCalcite was more effective to immobilize Cd in the forest soil than in the mine soil. In \n\nthe mine soil the rates of calcite decreased the Cd release in the initials times (0 to 30 min) \n\n(Figure 3). In the first 30 min the cumulative desorption in the mine soil amended with rates \n\nof calcite ranged from 9.3 to 10.7%, while in the unamended soil it was 11.5%. However, \n\nafter 120 min, the cumulative desorption of the amended soil was bigger or equal the \n\nunamended soil. The amount desorbed was 15.2, 16.1, 15.5 and, 15.2% for the full rate, half \n\nrate, quarter rate and unamended soil, respectively. The decrease of the release of Cd during \n\nthe first 30 min could be due to the buffering capacity caused by the calcite. Considering that \n\nthe mine soil was already alkaline (Table 3), this favored so that calcite remained without \n\nreacting on the soil.  \n\nThe treatment with calcite increased the Cd extracted in the F3 (organic matter \n\nbound) (Figure 5). The other fractions did not have significant changes. Calcite reduces the \n\nH+ concentration and increase the negative charges sites52, and this could increase the \n\nadsorption of Cd in the organic matter. Soil organic matter is one of the most important soil \n\ncomponents controlling the heavy metal adsorption and desorption in the soil. It has two \n\nimportant binding sites that are carboxylic and phenolic groups that controlling metal binding, \n\nand each type of binding site formed through various combinations of those two types of sites \n\nhave distinct thermodynamic properties, such as the proton and metal binding constants.62\u2013\n\n64Organic matter of the soil sorb the Cd at negatively charged carboxylic and phenolic groups \n\nor directly with these and other groups forming monodentate or multidentate bonding \n\n(chelation).61  \n\n \n\n\n\n86 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.

F4 = oxide, and F5 = residual (most strongly bound). Columns followed by \n\nthe same letter do not differ at 0.05 (Tukey test). \n\n \n\nThe amount of Cd released during all the time (0 to 120 min) in the forest soil was \n\nsmaller in all rates of calcite compared to the unamended soil (Figure 4). The cumulative \n\ndesorption after 120 min was 6.9, 6.4, 6.5 and 9.6% for the full rate, half rate, quarter rate and \n\nunamended soil, respectively. The decreasing in the Cd desorption in this soil amended with \n\nrates of calcite probably occurred due to the increase in the pH. This soil attribute is the most \n\ndominant factor influencing Cd sorption in soils.65,66  \n\nThe increase in the pH increase the negative surface charge in the iron oxides, \n\norganic matter and phyllosilicates.67 Cd decreased in the F4 (iron oxides bound) and increased \n\nin the F3 (organic matter bound) (Figure 6), and this could happen because the pH increased \n\nthe negative charge in the organic matter and favored the Cd bound as discussed before. \n\n \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6. Relative distributions of Cd in the forest among the various soil fractions in different \n\ntreatments and rates. F1= exchangeable, F2= carbonate-associated, F3 = organic-matter \n\nassociated.

Columns followed by the \n\nsame letter do not differ at 0.05 (Tukey test). \n\n \n\n4.3.2.3 Biosolids  \n\nThe treatment with biosolids was effective to immobilize Cd in both soils (Figure 3 \n\nand 4). However, the effectiveness was more evident in the forest soil than in the mine soil. In \n\nthe first 30 min, the amount of Cd desorbed in the mine soil ranged from 10.8 to 9.4% while it \n\nwas 11.5% in the unamended soil. After 120 min the amount desorbed was 16.1, 14.1, 15.3 \n\nand 15.2% for the 5%, 10%, 20%, and unamended soil, respectively. This showed that \n\nbiosolids was effective to reduce the amount released in the initial times (30 min) but with a \n\nhigher time of desorption (120 min) they were pretty similar to the unamended soil. On the \n\nother hand, the forest soil amended with rates of biosolids was effective to decrease Cd \n\ndesorption in all time (0 to 120 min). The cumulative desorption after 120 min was 6.5, 7.6, \n\n8.3 and 9.6% for the 5%, 10%, 20% and unamended soil, respectively.  \n\n\n\n88 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe biosolids increased the amount of Cd extracted in the F3 (organic matter bound) \n\nfor both soils (Figure 5 and 6). Nevertheless, in the forest soil, the Cd in the F3 increased 70% \n\nfor the rate of 20% whereas this increase was only 10% in the mine soil. These results \n\nindicate that the biosolids increased the Cd bounded to organic compounds on the soil due to \n\norganic matter present in this amendment. The biosolids contains significant quantities of \n\norganic matter and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus.68\u201370 Also, the organic matter \n\nfrom biosolids may increase the pH, cation exchange capacity and sorption sites might affect \n\nsorption of heavy metals in soils.71\u201373   \n\nThe forest soil had an increase in the pH due the biosolids application. This also may \n\nhelp to increase the immobilization of Cd. The biosolids also could increase the DOC on the \n\nsoil and form Cd-DOC. These organic compounds may decrease, increase or have no effect \n\non Cd sorption.61 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7. pH of the leachate (A) and the concentration of Cd on the leachate (B) for the rates \n\nof phosphate applied in the mine soil. \n\n \n\n4.3.2.4 Biochar \n\nThe results of desorption kinetics and sequential extraction varied between the rates \n\nof biochar applied (Figure 3 to 6). As biosolids, the biochar was more effective to reduce the \n\nCd release in the forest soil than mine soil. The cumulative desorption in the first 30 min for \n\nthe mine soil was 10.3, 8.7, 11.0 and 11.5% for the rate of 2.5%, 5%, 10% and unamended \n\nsoil, respectively (Figure 3). For the forest soil, the cumulative desorption was 6.1, 5.1, 3.9 \n\nand 5.9 for the rate of 2.5%, 5%, 10% and unamended soil, respectively (Figure 4). In the \n\n\n\n89 \n\n \n\nmine soil the cumulative Cd desorbed after 120 min was 15.7, 15.4, 14.5 and 15.2 for the rate \n\nof 2.5%, 5%, 10% and unamended soil, respectively, while for the forest soil, the cumulative \n\ndesorption was 10.1, 8.0, 7.2 and 9.6% for the rates of 2.5%, 5%, 10% and unamended soil, \n\nrespectively.  \n\nIn the forest, the rate of 5% and 10% had a smaller cumulative desorption after 120 \n\nand only the rate of 2.5% had a higher release in comparison with the unamended soil. But, \n\nfor the mine soil, only the rate of 10% had a smaller cumulative desorption of Cd after 120 \n\nmin. Puga et al.74 evaluated the effect of rates of biochar in a soil from a Zn mining area in \n\nVazante. They also utilized biochar produced from sugar cane straw but different temperature \n\nof pyrolysis (700 oC) and incubation time (120 days). The authors74 observed a linear \n\nreduction of the available Cd in soil extracted by EDTA due to the rates (1.5, 3.0 and 5.0%, \n\nw/w) of biochar applied. The immobilization of Cd by the biochar application have previously \n\nbeen reported.23,75\u201377 \n\nThe treatment with biochar in both soils decreased the Cd in the F4 (iron oxides \n\nbound) and increased in the F3 (organic matter bound) (Figure 5 and 6). The biochar \n\nincreased the amount of C in both soils, and that is in agreement with the results of the \n\nsequential extraction where the amount of Cd in the F3 (organic matter bound) increased. \n\nCuriously, Wang et al.58 did not observe increase in the Cd extracted in the organic matter \n\nfraction in a soil amended with pine biochar, but found a decrease in the exchangeable \n\nfraction. However, in their soil, almost 60% of the Cd was extracted in the exchangeable \n\nfraction, while in our soils they were between 10 for the mine soil and 0% for the forest soil. \n\nThis shows that the species of Cd present in their soil probably were different from ours. \n\nAnother explanation for these differences is that they incubated the soil only for 5 days, \n\nwhereas we used 60 days, and probably the biochar did not have enough time to react with the \n\nsoil. The chemical characteristics of the soil and biochar also could have influenced these \n\ndifferences.   \n\nFeedstock type and pyrolysis condition are the main factors influencing the sorption \n\nbehavior of biochars.78 Biochar has a high carbon content,79 stable physical and chemical \n\nproperties and large specific surface area with good adsorption capacity for heavy metals and \n\nions.58 Biochar may have high sorption ability from three reasons: (i) electrostatic interactions \n\nnegatively charged carbon surface and metal cations; (ii) ionic exchange between ionizable \n\nprotons at the surface of acidic carbon and metal cations and (iii) sorptive interaction \n\ninvolving delocalized electrons of carbon.80 \n\n \n\n\n\n90 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.4 Summary and Conclusions \n\nSome amendments were effective to immobilize Cd in the soil from mining area and \n\nadjacent forest. In the mining soil amended with phosphate, the desorption kinetics of Cd \n\ndecreased more in the initial times (30 min) and the half rate and quarter rate of phosphate \n\nwere more effective to decrease the desorption after 120 min of cumulative desorption. For \n\nthe forest soil, the half rate and quarter rate of phosphate also were most effective to decrease \n\nCd desorption. The results of sequential did not show different between the Cd extracted in \n\neach fraction for the forest soil. On the other hand, in the soil from mining area, the Cd \n\ncontents decreased in the carbonate forms and increased in the organic matter bound forms. \n\nThis is an evidence that the treatment with phosphate may have increased the negative charge \n\nin the organic matter, thus favoring the Cd bound and decreasing its desorption. Cd also may \n\nhave precipitated with stable phosphate species.  The half rate and the quarter rate of \n\nphosphate leached more Cd in the mining soil than the unamended soil. The amount leached \n\nfollowed the pH of the leached solution, indicating that this attribute may control Cd \n\ndesorption. The increase in Cd leached in the half rate and quarter rate could be attributed to \n\nthe formation of Cd-P complexes in the solution. \n\nCalcite was more effective to reduce the cumulative Cd desorption in the forest than \n\nin the mine soil. In the mining soil, this treatment decreased the cumulative Cd desorbed in \n\nthe first 30 min and was almost equal to the unamended soil after 120 min.  In the forest soil, \n\nall rates of calcite had less cumulative desorption of Cd than in the unamended soil after 120 \n\nmin. In both soils, the Cd extracted in the F3 (organic matter bound) increased, and it shows \n\nthat addition of calcite increased the pH and increased the negative charges site on the organic \n\nmatter. The calcite also could increase the buffering capacity in the mining soil because this \n\nsoil already was alkaline. \n\nThe organic amendments (biochar and biosolids) were effective to decrease the \n\namount of Cd desorbed in the kinetics experiment. However, the decrease in the Cd \n\ndesorption was more pronounced in the forest than in the mine soil. In the mine soil the rate \n\nof 2.5 and 5% of biochar decreased the cumulative desorption in the initial time (30 min). \n\nHowever, after 120 min, the desorption was almost equal to the unamended soil. The same \n\nbehavior was observed for the rate of 5 and 10% of biosolids. On the other hand, in the forest \n\nsoil, except for the rate of 2.5% of biochar, the rates of biochar and biosolids decreased the \n\ncumulative desorption of Cd than unamended soil. Both amendments increased the Cd \n\n\n\n91 \n\n \n\nextracted in the F3 (organic matter bound), and these results indicate that Cd was probably \n\nadsorbed on the organic matter compounds provided by the biochar and biosolids. \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n(1)  U.S. Geological Survey.

In general, phosphate was effective to decrease Zn, Pb, and Cd desorption. The \n\ndecrease in Pb desorption was probably due to the formation of pyromorphite that was \n\nidentified by the bulk XANES. The full rate of P increased Zn desorption probably because of \n\nthe decrease in the pH thus causing the formation of ZnO (identified by the \u00b5-XANES and \n\nbulk XANES) that is more soluble than the other species identified, such as Zn-kerolite. After \n\nphosphate addition, most parts of Zn species was changed to Zn-P. On the other hand, the \n\nquarter rate and the half rate were effective to decrease Zn desorption, suggesting either the \n\nformation of more stable species such as Zn-P or the adsorption to the soil constituents. \n\nPhosphate also was more effective to decrease Cd desorption in the half rate and quarter rate, \n\nthus suggesting the formation of Cd-P species, or due to an increase in the negative charge in \n\nthe surface of mineral or organic compounds.  \n\nCalcite was effective to increase Zn, Pb, and Cd immobilization in the soil. Even \n\nthough we did not observe differences in Zn species by the bulk XANES, the results of \n\ndesorption kinetics showed that calcite decreased Zn desorption in all rates applied, but the \n\nquarter rate and half rate were most effective. The LCF of the Pb in the soil amended with \n\ncalcite showed that some species (Pb-bentonite and anglesite) were changed to pyromorphite. \n\nAll rates of calcite desorbed almost the same amount of Pb. Calcite decreased the Cd \n\ndesorption kinetics in the initial times in the mining soil, and the full rate was the most \n\neffective, while all rates desorbed almost the same amount of Cd in the forest soil. The \n\nsequential extraction suggested that part of Cd was immobilized on the organic matter as a \n\nresult of the calcite treatment. \n\nBiochar was effective to decrease Zn desorption and was more effective in the rate of \n\n5%. No differences were observed in the Zn bulk XANES spectra but, in the sequential \n\nextraction experiment, Zn increased in the F3 (organic matter- OM associated) and F4 (iron \n\noxides associated) fractions, which suggests that these two fractions could have immobilized \n\nthe element. Biochar increased the desorption kinetics of Pb in all rates utilized. Part of Pb \n\nspecies was modified to Pb-citrate, and this species could have caused the increase of Pb \n\nmobility. The results of sequential extraction showed an increase in the Pb extracted in the \n\nOM fraction, which is evidence that Pb could have associated with organic compounds. \n\nDifferent from Pb, the desorption kinetics of Cd decreased due to biochar applications, and \n\n\n\n100 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe results of sequential extraction suggested that Cd could have been immobilized on the \n\norganic matter. \n\nBiosolids also decreased Zn desorption and was most effective in the rate of 10%. As \n\noccurred with biochar, no differences were found in the bulk XANES spectra of this \n\ntreatment, but the sequential extraction showed an increase in the Zn associated to OM (F3). \n\nBiosolids increased Pb desorption in all rates. By LCF we identified Pb-citrate and PbCl2 that \n\ncould have been responsible for increasing Pb mobility. Biosolids also decreased the \n\ndesorption kinetics of Cd for the mining and forest soil, and caused an increase in the Cd \n\nextracted in the OM fraction, thus suggesting that Cd was immobilized by organic \n\ncompounds, as occurred with biochar. \n\nThe combination of synchrotron-based techniques, desorption kinetics and sequential \n\nextraction are powerful tools to evaluate the behavior of heavy metals in contaminated soils \n\nafter the addition of amendments. Our results will may help to develop an/or improve modern \n\nand effective strategies to remediate mine waste contaminated soils. The heavy metals had \n\ndifferent behaviors as affected by the addition of amendments. An interesting result is that the \n\nhalf rate and quarter rate were more effective to decrease the mobility of heavy metals than \n\nthe full rate in some treatments, and this information is important to create some more cost-\n\neffective and sustainable solutions. \n\nFuture researches may focus on the effect of the mixing effect of different \n\namendments. Soils contaminated with multiple elements such ours may need to be remediated \n\nwith different amendments because one amendment could immobilize one element and \n\nmobilize another one. The effect of incubation time and other sources of amendments should \n\nalso be detailed in future researches."}]}}}
