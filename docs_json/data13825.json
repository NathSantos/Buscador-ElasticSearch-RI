O Nymphaeum hoje, \u00e9 uma ru\u00edna, onde o restauro da \nfun\u00e7\u00e3o e da estrutura criam uma permanente cenografia dependendo do dia e da hora, criando um \n\njogo de transpar\u00eancia, cheio e vazio, luz e sombra, som e sil\u00eancio.\n\nIntRoductIon \n\nThe R.Lemaire International Centre for Conservation of the K.U.Leuven was involved in the \narchitectural and structural Bauforshung of the remains of the Late Hellenistic Nymphaeum on \nthe archaeological site of Sagalassos (Patr\u00edcio [et al.] 1993; Patr\u00edcio [et al.] 1995), as well as in its \nrestoration (Van Balen [et al.] 1995, Ercan [et al.] 1997, Patr\u00edcio [et al.] 2000). \n\nArchaeological excavations in Sagalassos started in 1990 under the direction of Prof. Marc \nWaelkens from the Department of Archaeology of the K.U.Leuven, Belgium. When the excavations \nstarted, the remains of the Nymphaeum dated from the 1st century B.C., were almost completely \nburied under slop deposits from the mountains. During the excavations, a relatively well preserved \nfountain house came to daylight (Waelkens [et al.] 1991, Waelkens [et al.] 1993, Waelkens [et al.] \n1995). The rectangular building, 10.90 m wide and 7.33 m deep, orientated to the south is set into the \nmountains slope. It is constructed in limestone carved blocks in a regular polygonal dry masonry \narrangement. The fountain is composed by three Doric porticoes in a U-shaped lay-out. The \nporticoes are composed of eight half-columns attached to a rectangular pillar and to corner pillars, \nthus establishing the partition of the space into nine parts. These supports stand on the parapet \nof the water basin. The parapet projects forward below each column to resemble a pedestal. The \nentablature is made up of architraves and friezes together with their cornices. The cornices make \nthe roof of the water basins (Patr\u00edcio [et al.] 1995).\n\nTo restore a ruin obliges to the elaboration of a preliminary program based on the values \nassessment of the remains and their cultural significance for the site and for the region. During \nthe excavating, it was realised that the structure of the fountain house, a structure made by carved \nstone with dry joints from the late Hellenistic period - a common and everyday building in its times \n- was presenting an inestimable value: nearly all of the architectural elements were present in the \narea of the building (Figure 2) and presenting a good state of conservation together with the in-situ \nremains (Patr\u00edcio [et al.] 1995). The aim of the project follows the vocation of the ruin: preserving \nthe monument by its physical restitution, re-establishing it\u2019s initial and nowadays missing volumes \nby reusing all its original architectural elements and placing them into their original positions. \n(Figure 3, Figure 4) The integrity recovered and its beauty suggested while preserving the original \nstructural behaviour of each architectural element. Besides, as the natural water spring still exists, \nthe final physical restitution aimed above all to recover the original Nymphaeum vocation by \nrestoring its original function of a fountain.\n\n\n\nRevista Arquitectura Lus\u00edada.1 79\n\nThe restruturation of the hellenistic Foundation of Sagalassos in Turkey\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Site plan\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 General view during the excavations, July 1992.\n\nFigure 3 \u2013 General view before the restoration works, August 1993.\n\n\n\n80 Revista Arquitectura Lus\u00edada.1\n\nTeresa Cristina Patr\u00edcio\n\nFigure 4 \u2013 General view after the restoration woks, September 1997.\n\nAfter the preliminary works and excavations at the Nymphaeum, a restoration project applying \nanastylosis techniques was proposed for the stone structure of the Late Hellenistic Nymphaeum. \nThe first phase of the work, from 1991 to 1992, included gathering information and preparing the \ndiscovered material for further restoration (Patr\u00edcio [et al.] 1993). The second phase began in 1993 \nand led to partial anastylosis of some parts of the building with the partial anastylosis of fragments and \nblocks. A preliminary study of the architectural elements in 1992 also allowed the first experiments \nand tests during the campaign of 1993, as well as a detailed study by means of direct investigation. \nIt was possible, as a result, to establish relationships among fragments, to determine the general \nshape of the building, (Figure 5, Figure 6) as well as to define the construction techniques, the stone \ncarving process, lifting techniques, surface treatment, etc. The third phase began in 1994. Research \nfocused on the position in which the stones were found at the time of excavation and on their \nrelation with the structure. Graphic restitutions were established (Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8). The \narchitectural elements were restored (Ercan [et al.] 1997; Patr\u00edcio [et al.] 1997). During the campaign \nof 1995, 1996 and 1997, the final anastylosis and reinstatement of the monument reusing the original \nand restored architectural elements was realised. The restoration project of the Late Hellenistic \nNymphaeum by its formal, structural and functional restitution was completed the 3rd September \n1997.

Therefore for the drawing up of the restoration \nproject of the late Hellenistic Nymphaeum and for the choices of the various restoration methods it \nwas essential to define several principals to be used as project guidelines. They can be summarised \nin the following topics: restitution, authenticity, reversibility, compatibility and retreatability.\n\nThe respect and preservation of the original material was our premise to decide the type of \nrestoration to be applied to the Nymphaeum. The choice of the restoration techniques was based \non the principle of a minimum intervention. If the main goal was to preserve its integrity, with the \nrespect to the original materials the idea of a reconstruction - new construction of a structure and use \nof new materials - was out of priori. Only a restitution - to reinstate a structure with its original materials \n- could promote correctly the intentions. \n\nThe authenticity of the ruins of the Nymphaeum revealed through the excavations should \nbe understood as different levels of significance. Apart from the authenticity of the materials - \nwhich is easily understood as being the original building material and architectural elements - the \noriginal structural system, destroyed by an earthquake, also represents a \u2018state of understanding\u2019 \nregarding the construction of fountains houses built as trabeated structures. The latter means that \nthere is some added value in reassembling the structure as it was originally, instead of creating a \nnew structure which would \u2018carry\u2019 the architectural elements of the Nymphaeum. The design of the \nintervention aimed to protect the original elements of the structure, rather than just its architectural \nappearance. (Ercan [et al.] 1997, Patr\u00edcio [et al.] 2000)\n\nReversibility is a term that has often been used in the conservation of historical heritage. \nAt the end of the 20th century this principle was very much applied to architectural restoration. \nAn international group of experts came recently to the conclusion that: \u201c...Along with minimum \nintervention, the concept of reversibility has been considered to be one of the principal requirements of \nconservation treatments. However, in the case of the treatment under discussion, reversibility is often not \nachievable and in some instances not applicable. Prompted by the suggestion made by Sasse and Snethlage \nas well as discussions which have long taken place in the field, it was proposed that the requirements of \nreversibility be replaced by the demand for compatibility and retreatability...\u201d (Teutonico [et al.] 1997). \n\nSimply stated, \u2018compatibility\u2019 means that introduced treatment materials will not have negative \nconsequences while \u2018retreatability\u2019 means that the conservation treatment in the present would not \nprevent or impede further treatment in the future. While in the context of the discussion about \nreversibility mentioned above was mainly in reference to surface treatments, these criteria also \napply to the treatment carried out on the Nymphaeum. In the context of a structural treatment in an \nearthquake risk-area, this can be translated into the idea that an earthquake should not create more \ndamage than damage created by previous earthquakes. It also means that if a next earthquake \nwould damage the Nymphaeum structure as in the past, the types of treatments proposed for the \nrestoration should at least remain re-executable.\n\n\n\nRevista Arquitectura Lus\u00edada.1 83\n\nThe restruturation of the hellenistic Foundation of Sagalassos in Turkey\n\nRestoRatIon of the stone stRuctuRe - fIeld WoRk\n\nThe field works at the Nymphaeum concentrate on the following: archaeological research, \narchitectural investigation (detailed survey of the membra disjecta and in-situ remains) (Figure 5, \nFigure 6), restoration of the stone carved blocks (membra disjecta and in-situ remains), replacement \nof missing parts of the structure, consolidation and levelling of the foundations, correction of the \nwest wall\u2019s distortion, controlling and canalising the natural water spring with testing of mortars \nfor the water basins and final anastylosis of the structure. \n\nThe first problem to solve for the re-erection of the dismembered building was to make up \nsound blocks, as strong as they had been originally. Broken fragments had to be joined together \nand where parts of the blocks were missing they needed to be completed for structural integrity. \nThe materials and techniques, after being studied and improved through laboratory tests were \nthen applied for the restoration of the fountain house. (Ercan [et al.] 1997) The restoration of the \nstone blocks can be divided into four main activities: joining the broken parts, completing the \nmissing parts consolidation and cleaning of the blocks.\n\nJoining of the broken stone blocks\n\nAn epoxy-based adhesive mixed with a limestone powder filler was used to glue small \nfragments. By mixing the epoxy adhesive with an inert filler of powdered limestone the strength of \nthe adhesion and cohesion has been reduced to almost the strength of the stone itself.\n\nFor joining the structurally important broken blocks, such as columns drums, architraves and \ncornices, fibreglass rods were used together with the epoxy adhesive. Two conditions were imposed \non this work. First, the broken blocks should be joined in such a way that the strength of the \njoined block would not exceed the limit state strength of the monolithic block. Second, if the joined \nblock were to break, it should break again in the original failure. To fulfil these requirements, the \napplication area of the epoxy glue was limited to only half of the broken surface and the Fiberglas \nreinforcing rods were designed appropriately according to these considerations. The brittle nature \nof the fibreglass is an advantage here, as it means that the reconstruction can be altered at any time \nin the future, as the broken reinforcement can be removed and replaced by a similar system. The \nnumber, size and length of the reinforcing rods varied according to the broken parts of the block \nand its structural function. For the blocks under flexural stress, like architraves and cornices, the \nrods should have a certain anchorage length, so that they would not be pulled out. Generally 4 \nfibreglass rods of 34 cm length and 16 mm diameter were used for joining these blocks (Figure \n8). Shorter rods are sufficient for joining the column drums, as the main structural stress on them \nwould be in shear. Generally 4 fibreglass rods of 20 cm length and 12 mm diameter were used to \njoin the columns drums.\n\n\n\n84 Revista Arquitectura Lus\u00edada.1\n\nTeresa Cristina Patr\u00edcio\n\nFigure 9 \u2013 For joining the architraves, fibreglass rods were used together with the epoxy adhesive.\n\ncompleting the missing parts of the stone blocks\n\nAfter joining the fragments composing a block, missing parts had to be completed to fulfil \nthe structural integrity. An epoxy mortar obtained by mixing epoxy adhesive with well-graded \ncrushed limestone filler was used for this purpose. The maximum particle size of the filler was 2 \nmm and the binder to filler ratio of the mortar varied in between 1:5 to 1:8 by volume, according to \nthe application. The epoxy mortar, which was tested earlier in the laboratory, has similar physical \nproperties to the original stone. Its mechanical properties are slightly weaker than the original \nstone and it also has a more elastic behaviour than the stone.\n\n \n\nFigure 10 \u2013 View of a joined cornice block, before the missing parts were completed.\nThe fibreglass rods used for joining the two fragments are visible.\n\n\n\nRevista Arquitectura Lus\u00edada.1 85\n\nThe restruturation of the hellenistic Foundation of Sagalassos in Turkey\n\nFigure 11 \u2013 View of the cornice block after its missing parts were completed by an epoxy mortar.\nThe epoxy mortar will then be covered by the final covering mortar.\n\nFigure 12 \u2013 View of a restored column drum. The filling and the covering mortar are visible\nas well as the fibreglass rod for the vertical connexion of the drum.\n\n\n\n86 Revista Arquitectura Lus\u00edada.1\n\nTeresa Cristina Patr\u00edcio\n\nThe epoxy mortar was applied in a few layers, where each layer was compacted firmly. \nAccording to the volume to fill and the structural function of the block to be completed, fibreglass \nbars were sometimes used for a stronger bond between the epoxy mortar and the stone blocks \n(Figure 10, Figure 11). As epoxy mortars discolour under ultraviolet radiation and in order to create \na proper surface texture, a 1 to 2 cm thick covering mortar was applied over the dried epoxy fillings \n(Figure 12). The covering mortar was a zinc chloride-based mineral mortar, which was also tested \nin laboratory before being used. This quick setting and non-shrinking covering mortar has a very \nsimilar colour to the stone and its shape and textures can be finished easily by carving (Figure 15).\n\nstructural consolidation of the stone slocks\n\nStructural consolidation was necessary for stone blocks of structural importance that had severe \ncracks. First the stones were detected by inspection and sound testing, then structural consolidation \nwas undertaken where necessary by pinning fibreglass rods, anchored by an epoxy grout, through \nthe cracks. Fibreglass rods of 7 mm and 8 mm diameter and at least 20 cm length were used. Some \nof the in-situ blocks were also consolidated in-situ using the pinning method. \n\nnon-structural consolidation\n\nThe fissured and flaking stone blocks of no structural importance were consolidated in-situ \nby injection of water-porous glue. Different materials were tested and evaluated for this purpose. \nThe most important criterion was that the sealed crack should allow water vapour through, so \nthat the wet and very fine sand present in the crack could dry, in this way frost damage due to the \nexpansion of the water trapped in the crack is avoided. After these consolidations, all the fissures \nand cracks were sealed with a zinc chloride-based covering mortar, to avoid water seeping in, \nwhich could cause further frost damage. \n\ncleaning of the blocks \n\nAll the restored blocks were cleaned with cold water under pressure (100 to 200 bars). A \nchemical cleaning method was applied to the biological dirt deposits that did not come off with \nwater. A cleaning product \u201ccomplexion paste\u201d was used for this. The pasta was applied on the \nstone surface with a brush and was covered with a plastic cling-film to prevent drying out. After \ntwo days the paste was washed away with water under pressure. The cleaning product, which \ndoes not leave or generate harmful salts on the stone, was tested earlier in laboratory. The final \ncleaning was done after putting the blocks in place. \n\nreplacement of missing parts of the building\n\nThe architectural investigation of the fountain house revealed that some complete stone blocks \nfrom the original structure were missing: wall blocks from the south and west wall, steps blocks \nfrom the entrance stair, cornices and capitals. Since the start of the project, the principle of minimum \nintervention was a fundamental aspect in our philosophy. Following this principle, it was clear \nthat the missing blocks were only replaced by new elements when it was strictly necessary for the \npositioning of an existing one (Figure 17, Figure 18). (Patr\u00edcio [et al.] 2000: 408) \n\n\n\nRevista Arquitectura Lus\u00edada.1 87\n\nThe restruturation of the hellenistic Foundation of Sagalassos in Turkey\n\nFigure 13 \u2013 Preparing a new carved capital for the insertion of the existing\nfragments from the original capital.\n\nFigure 14 \u2013 Insertion of original fragments in a new carved capital.\n\nFor the replacement of the missing blocks by new elements two problems arose: The \ndetermination of the shape and proportions of the missing element and the choice of the material \nto produce them. From the study of the existing material it was easy to extrapolate the shape \nand dimensions of the missing elements. Nowadays, different materials are being used in \nvarious restorations all over the Mediterranean area, such as artificial stone, concrete and stone. \nFor structural reasons the missing parts should be on a material with physical and mechanical \nproperties similar to the original parts of the structure. It was decided to prepare new wall blocks, \nstairs steps and capitals by carving natural stone, from a quarry in the region and with similar \n\n\n\n88 Revista Arquitectura Lus\u00edada.1\n\nTeresa Cristina Patr\u00edcio\n\ngeological properties. This material is not expensive in Turkey and being a similar material to \nthe original allowed us to remain faithful to the materials, construction techniques and structural \nbehaviour of the ancient building.\n\nFurthermore, the use of natural stone cannot harm the building, its long-term durability is \nknown and it is highly compatible with the original material from an aesthetic and structural point \nof view. (Patr\u00edcio [et al.] 1997, Patr\u00edcio [et al.] 2000) As the main goal of the project was to preserve \nthe original material it was decided to integrate all the small capitals fragments found into the \nnew carved blocks (Figure 13, Figure 14). To improve the aesthetic integration, the final shades \nand decorations of the new carved stones, as well as matching the integrated original fragments, \nwere further finished when the new blocks were in their final position on the structure (Figure \n15, Figure 16). The final surface carving was integrated into the ancient one to guarantee a more \nsatisfactory aesthetic result without constituting a violation of the principle that the modern parts \nshould remain distinguishable from the older ones (Venice Charter: 1964).\n\nFigure 15 \u2013 The original small fragments integrated into the new carved blocks.\nThe final decorations as well as matching the integrated original fragments were further finished. \n\nFigure 16 \u2013 Final surface carving of the integrations after their final anastylosis.\n\n\n\nRevista Arquitectura Lus\u00edada.1 89\n\nThe restruturation of the hellenistic Foundation of Sagalassos in Turkey\n\nFigure 17 \u2013 First level of anastylosis, without introducing new carved elements.\n\nFigure 18 \u2013 Second level of anastylosis, introducing the new carved capital.\n\n\n\n90 Revista Arquitectura Lus\u00edada.1\n\nTeresa Cristina Patr\u00edcio\n\nthe fInal anastylosIs\n\nThe architectural research for the existing in-situ remains demonstrated and quantified the \nmovement suffered by the structure during its destruction by the earthquakes. The earthquake \nforces induced a movement of the structure in the Southwest / Northeast directions. This resulted \nin the total collapse of the west and east porticoes, in a partial destruction of the west wall and in \ninducing a strong tilt in the wall to the east side and the consequent slipping of the foundations of \nthe east and west porticoes. Since the beginning of the excavations and its consequent restoration, \nwe wanted to avoid dismantling the still in situ remains of the structure in order to preserve, as \nfar as possible, the structure\u2019s original integrity. Therefore, for the reconstitution of the porticoes, \nit was necessary to dismantle the in-situ elements in order to correct their levels and positions. \nThe heavily damaged load bearing column bases were consolidated. The foundation level was \ncorrected with natural hydraulic lime mortar mixed with small rubble; which provided a correctly \nlevelled bed. After replacing the basin parapets the foundations were strengthened by the injection \nof a plastic hydraulic mortar to increase the contact area between the stones of the foundations and \nthe stones of the bed rock on which they were placed. \n\nAfter stabilising the foundations and column bases it was possible to start the final anastylosis \nof the restored blocks. Originally column drums and capitals were linked by vertical iron dowels \nset in square blocks of lead. The architraves were posed directly on the capital and interconnected \nwith P-shaped rectangular iron cramps that were also protected with lead. For the reconstitution \nof the vertical dowels fibreglass dowels of 15 mm diameter and 10 cm length were used, which \nwere fixed in the original dowel holes by means of an epoxy grout (Figure 12). For the cramps a \nrolling pin made by a fibreglass mesh was prepared, placed into the original cramp holes and fixed \nalso with an epoxy grout. The intention of these dowel and cramp connections is not to create a \nrigid connection, which will cause the crushing of the blocks in case of a severe earthquake\u2019s but \nto protect the original blocks by breaking just before the stone breakage and realising the blocks to \nconsume the imposed energy through free movement.\n\n \n\nthe noWadays Image of the nymphaeum\n\nWith this paper, we wanted to express the guidelines of our decisions, the reasons for ours \nchoices, and the results of our actions concerning the stone restoration. We wanted to express \nhow it was possible with a ruin and some 300 stones and fragments to revive the history and the \nstructure of the Nymphaeum of Sagalassos. \n\nThe system used for the restoration of the stone blocks of the Nymphaeum - the Fiberglas-\nepoxy system - had as main goal to join and integrate the stone elements so that they will be as \nstrong as their monolithic form, and when connected in the structure - different stone elements \nconnected vertically and horizontally - the connection will be less strong than the stone itself (Ercan \n[et al.] 1997). Having a high mechanical strength, the system makes it possible to strengthen the \nmembers and the structure itself with minimum intervention. Moreover, the system is compatible \nwith the stone because it acts as a unit in itself and as a whole with the stone, creating a perfect \nbond. The retreatability of the system can be guaranteed with the applied dimensions. The starting \npoint set by the objective of looking for a repair technique based on conservation principals of \nminimum intervention, compatibility and retreatability has helped to find a new technology much \nmore adapted to the requirements formulated in this anastylosis project.\n\n\n\nRevista Arquitectura Lus\u00edada.1 91\n\nThe restruturation of the hellenistic Foundation of Sagalassos in Turkey\n\nNowadays the Late Hellenistic Nymphaeum presents an inestimable value for the society, \nfor the site, for the region, and for the world of archaeological conservation: the recovering of its \nstructural integrity, the suggestion of its original beauty, and the salvage of the original Nymphaeum \nfunction as a fountain.  \n\nMany questions must be considered with the choice of restoring methods and, this makes the \nmission of restoring and presenting architectural ruins so difficult and so engaging. The nowadays \nrestitution of the Sagalassos Nymphaeum answers in our point of view, to our premise concerns. \nFrom the beginning, we knew that at the same time we had to protect the ruin, to prolong its \nexistence, to preserve its symbolic character and to make it more readable to the visitor. Today, the \nvisitor of Sagalassos will not anymore see a ruin frozen in time with a panel in front. He will see \nagain an architectural object; he will understand it in its totality and will repeat the same journey \nas 21 centuries ago - walking from the centre of the city to the Theatre, taking a rest at the fountain \nhouse to have same fresh and cold water.\n\nacknoWledgements\n\nThis paper was possible thanks to the collaboration of the engineer S.Ercan and to the Prof \nir.arch.
