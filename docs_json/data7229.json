A s\u00edntese do \nbiodiesel a partir dos \u00f3leos de Aleurites moluccana, Jatropha curcas e borras \nde caf\u00e9 foram aqui estudados. As propriedades termodin\u00e2micas como \ndensidade, viscosidade, tens\u00e3o superficial, volatilidade e velocidade do som \ntamb\u00e9m foram medidas e estimadas usando modelos preditivos dispon\u00edveis na \nliteratura, incluindo as equa\u00e7\u00f5es de estado CPA e soft-SAFT.  \nTimor-Leste \u00e9 um pa\u00eds muito rico em recursos naturais, mas a maioria da \npopula\u00e7\u00e3o ainda vive na pobreza e na priva\u00e7\u00e3o de acesso a servi\u00e7os b\u00e1sicos e \ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es de vida decentes. A explora\u00e7\u00e3o de petr\u00f3leo e g\u00e1s no mar de Timor \ntem sido controlado pelo Fundo Petrol\u00edfero. O pa\u00eds ainda carece de \nelectricidade e combust\u00edveis que s\u00e3o cruciais para materializar as pol\u00edticas de \nredu\u00e7\u00e3o da pobreza. Como solu\u00e7\u00e3o, o governo timorense criou recentemente o \nPlano Estrat\u00e9gico de Desenvolvimento a 20 anos cujas prioridades incluem \ntrazer o desenvolvimento do petr\u00f3leo do mar para a costa sul de Timor-Leste e \ndesenvolver as energias renov\u00e1veis. \u00c9 neste \u00faltimo contexto que o biodiesel \nse insere.

Para ser usado como combust\u00edvel, no entanto, \no biodiesel deve possuir propriedades termodin\u00e2micas coerentes com as \nespecificadas nas normas da ASTM D6751 (nos Estados Unidos) ou EN 14214 \n(na Europa) para garantir uma adequada igni\u00e7\u00e3o, atomiza\u00e7\u00e3o e combust\u00e3o do \nbiodiesel no motor.  \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n\n \n\nTimor-Leste, biofuel, biodiesel, esters, thermodynamic properties, lipase, \nJatropha curcas, Aleurites moluccana, cofee waste, CPA , SAFT \n \n\nabstract \n\n \n\nThe biofuels have been at the forefront of global energy policies as their \nadvantages can overcome the uncertainties of fossil fuels. Biodiesel has \nproven to be a very reliable fuel alternative to petrodiesel. It is a mixture of fatty \nacid alkyl esters obtained by the transesterification of vegetable oils and animal \nfat. As fuel, biodiesel is economically viable, socially responsible, technically \ncompatible and environmentally friendly. The main challenge associated to its \ndevelopment concerns the choice of raw materials for its production. In third \nworld countries, edible oils are more important for feeding people than for \nrunning cars. \nThis thesis aims to produce / process biodiesel from resources endogenous of \nTimor-Leste and to measure/predict the thermodynamic properties of biodiesel, \nfrom those of alkyl esters. The synthesis of biodiesel from oils of Aleurites \nmoluccana, Jatropha curcas and coffee waste were here studied. The \nthermodynamic properties such as density, viscosity, surface tension, volatility \nand speed of sound were also measured and estimated using predictive \nmodels available in the literature including some equations of state like CPA \nand soft-SAFT. \nTimor Leste is a country rich in natural resources, but the majority of the \npopulation still lives in poverty and deprivation of access to basic services and \ndecent living conditions. The exploitation of oil and gas in the Timor Sea has \nfilled only the Oil Fund. The country still lacks electricity and fuels that are \ncrucial to materialize policies for poverty reduction. As a solution, the Timorese \ngovernment has recently established the Strategic Development Plan of 20 \nyears whose priorities include bringing the development of oil from the sea to \nthe south coast of Timor-Leste and developing renewable energy sources. It is \nin this latter context that biodiesel should be considered. Its development in the \ncountry will be contextually an appropriate solution for electricity supply, job \ncreation and especially combat against poverty and deprivation. To be used as \nfuel, however, biodiesel must possess thermodynamic properties consistent \nwith those specified in the standards of ASTM D6751 (in USA) or EN 14214 (in \nEurope) to ensure proper ignition, atomization and combustion in diesel \nengines. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\ni \n \n\nContents \n\nList of Figures ................................................................................................................................... iv \n\nList of Tables .................................................................................................................................... xii \n\nNomenclature .................................................................................................................................... xv \n\n1.

The rising trend of biofuel \n\nNowadays, since \u00abenergy &amp; fuel\u00bb becomes a frequent matter of worldwide concern \n\nand discussion, \u00absustainability\u00bb becomes a buzzword on everyone\u2019s lips. Given the \n\nscarcity of petroleum resources, the oil-importing countries (e.g., the OECD members) are \n\nconstantly worrying about their energy security whereas the oil-exporting countries (i.e., \n\nthe OPEC countries) are apprehensive about the impact of global energy demand on their \n\npetroleum resources. The truth is that the existing petroleum resources will not be always \n\navailable at reliable prices for the non-OPEC countries much less in the circumstances of \n\nfinancial or economic crisis. Moreover, their use is not only costly but also is rigorously \n\ncontrolled by the existing international environmental regulations like Kyoto and Montreal \n\nprotocols to avoid the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide \n\n(CO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) [1, 2] that are the main causative \n\nof global warming and consequent climate changes. It is noted, for example, that the \n\noverall CO2 emissions from petroleum fuels were 30.3 GtCO2 in 2010 and are foreseen to \n\nbe 37.0 GtCO2 in 2035 [3].  \n\nThis disquieting scenario can be a picture of contrasts in the coming decades. On \n\nthe one hand, due to the increase of global population (will reach 9 billion in 2040 ) and to \n\nthe growth of global economy (an annual average rate of 2.8 % from 2010 to 2040 ), the \n\nworldwide energy demand will be redoubling until 2040 particularly in Africa and Asia \n\npacific like China and India [4].The demand for oil will be more noticeable in the sector of \n\ntransportation than other sectors in 2035 (Figure1.1). On the other hand, the offer of crude \n\noil for the non-OPEC countries will be in continuous decrement until being negative (-4 \n\nmb/d) in the period between 2020 to 2035 comparing to that of non-crude oil (9 mb/d) [5]. \n\nThis situation has forced governments, civil societies and industries to develop energy \n\nfrom renewable resources aiming at reducing the petroleum dependency and mainly at \n\nproviding reliable, affordable and clean energy.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 1. Forecast of global energy demand [4] \n\nIn this perspective, biofuels have been already at the forefront of alternative fuels to \n\npetroleum fuels. Ethanol and biodiesel are able to replace totally or to be blended at any \n\nproportion with gasoline and petrodiesel respectively to be used in the conventional \n\nengines as they offer several benefits that can override many uncertainties of petroleum-\n\nbased fuels. Beyond renewable and clean, they are domestically produced from agricultural \n\nproducts such as sugarcane, oleaginous plants, forest biomass and other sources of organic \n\nmatter [6]. Their production will achieve circa 4.1 Mb/d by 2035 [7] especially when the \n\ngovernments also have decided to support financially their development. For example, on \n\n18\nth\n\n December 2012, five advanced biofuels projects and three bioenergy projects, to be \n\nhosted in Zone Euro member states, received funding of over \u20ac1.2 billion from the \n\nEuropean Commission [8]. In the United States of America, the administration of president \n\nBarack Obama also announced in 2012 up to $35 million over three years to support \n\nresearch and development in advanced biofuels, bioenergy and high-value bio-based \n\nproducts [9]. Shortly, biofuel is now popular in the arena of energy.  \n\nEthanol is a biocomponent for gasoline produced from sugarcane, sugar beet and \n\ncereals. Its average annual growth is 12.8 % from 2010 to 2020 [10] and will represent 73 \n\n% of biofuel demand in 2020 [11]. In Brazil, ethanol fuel has been sold as a low blend with \n\ngasoline (which varies between 18 to 25 % in volume) and also in a pure version (E100) \n\n[12, 13]. The high level mixture of ethanol with gasoline like E85 is foreseen to be \n\navailable worldwide only in 2035 where circa 37 % of domestic ethanol will be used [14].  \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n \n\nBiodiesel is a biocomponent for petrodiesel obtained from lipid feedstocks like \n\nvegetable oils, greases and animal fats [15, 16]. Its average annual growth is 28.2 % from \n\n2010 to 2020 [11] whose supply and demand are foreseen to continuously increase until \n\n2020 as illustrated by Figure 1.2 with the European Union being the protagonist of this \n\nincrease (44 % of share). The smaller contribution comes from the North America. In \n\nPortugal, there is already available in the market petrodiesel with 7 % of biodiesel (B7) \n\nsince January 2010 [17]. \n\n \n\nFigure 1 2.

Compositional profile and synthesis of biodiesel  \n\nChemically, biodiesel is a fuel composed of monoalkyl esters of long-chain fatty \n\nacids produced from the lipid feedstocks like vegetable oils, grease or animal fats [15, 16]. \n\nThese feedstocks are commonly known as triacylglycerides (TAGs) and the common fatty \n\nacid groups in biodiesel are described in Table 1.1 where the C16:0 and C18:0 fatty acids \n\nwith unsaturation bond up to three are the most common.  \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n \n\nTable 1 1.

To \n\nterm these fatty acids as fatty acid esters, one just changes the termination ic in the nomenclature of fatty acids with ate in that of esters (example from \n\nlauric to laurate). The common acronyms here presented will be used throughout this thesis.  \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n \n\nBiodiesel is usually synthesized from the transesterification reaction between the \n\ntriglycerides and short-chain alcohol such as methanol or ethanol in the presence of \n\ncatalysts such as an alkali. This reaction is reversible, although the back reaction is largely \n\nnegligible because the glycerol formed is not miscible with the product, leading to a two-\n\nphase system [19]. If methanol is used for the reaction, then the biodiesel produced is \n\ncomposed of fatty acids methyl esters (FAME). Equation 1.1 expresses the global \n\ntransesterification of triglycerides, where R1, R2, R3 are fatty acid chains.  \n\n \n\n \n\n(1.1) \n\n \n\n \n\nThere are several basic factors that affect the efficiency of the transesterification \n\nreaction such as free fatty acids (FFA), water content and proportion of alcohol to oil, \n\namount and type of catalyst, reaction temperature and stirring rate. Each factor is equally \n\nimportant to achieve a high quality biodiesel which meets the regulatory standards [20]. \n\nThe effect of feedstocks on the efficiency of transesterification reaction is normally \n\nassessed through FFA level and water content. FFA level is the percentage of saturated or \n\nunsaturated monocarboxylic acids that occurs naturally in oils but are not attached to \n\nglycerol backbones [21]. They can be removed in an acid-catalysed transesterification. \n\nAlkaline transesterification only tolerates oils with less than 3 % of FFA [20] because these \n\ncan react with the catalyst to form soaps that reduce the catalytic efficiency, as well as \n\ncausing an increase in viscosity, the formation of gels and difficulty in achieving \n\nseparation of glycerol [21, 22]. Water content must be as low as 0.1 % to prevent the \n\nhydrolysis of oils and decrease the conversion of ester [23]. Thus, the removal of the \n\nmoisture content by heating the oil before starting the transesterification reaction is \n\nrecommended.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n1.2.1.2.Type of catalysts \n\nAccording to the type of catalyst used in the process, transesterification reaction \n\ncan be alkali-catalysed, acid-catalysed or enzyme-catalysed. Each catalyst has its own \n\nsuitability for the reaction, depending on the quality of feedstocks.  \n\nFor an alkali-catalysed transesterification, either sodium hydroxide (NaOH), \n\npotassium hydroxide (KOH) or sodium methoxide (CH3ONa) could be used with methanol \n\nor ethanol as well as any kind of oils, refined, crude or frying [24]. Although the alkaline \n\ncatalyst is not corrosive for engine\u2019s metallic parts, it does not deal efficiently with oils \n\nwith high level of FFA and water content. Water retards the transesterification through the \n\nhydrolysis reaction. It hydrolyzes triglycerides to form more FFA instead of esters as \n\nshown in equation 1.2. The risk of FFA or water contamination results in soap formation, \n\nmaking downstream recovery and purification very difficult and expensive [25]. \n\n \n\n(1.2) \n\n \n\n \n\nA major advantage of base-catalysed transesterification is the mild reaction conditions, \n\nwhich for the production of methyl esters typically are 1h at 60\u201365 \u00baC and ambient \n\npressure, 1 % catalyst and a molar ratio of alcohol to oil of 6:1 [21]. \n\nAcid catalyst is more tolerant of FFA. So it is more suitable to treat oils with high \n\nlevels of FFA [26]. Strong acid such as sulfuric acid can catalyze the esterification of the \n\nFFA and the transesterification of the triglycerides without formation of soaps. The \n\nreaction is shown in equation 1.3. \n\n(1.3) \n\n \n\nAlthough the esterification of FFA is relatively fast, proceeding substantially to \n\ncompletion in one hour at 60 \u00baC, the transesterification of the triglycerides is very slow, \n\ntaking several days to complete. In this case, only an excess of the alcohol solves the \n\nproblem although hinders the recovery of the glycerol [27]. Another problem with acid \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n \n\ncatalysis is that the water production from the following reaction stays in the reaction \n\nmixture and ultimately stops the reaction, usually well before reaching completion. \n\nMoreover the corrosiveness of the acids may cause damage to the equipment and the \n\nreaction rate can also be low, sometimes taking more than a day to finish [25]. \n\nAcid catalysis followed by alkali catalysis can improve the transesterification \n\nprocess of low quality feedstocks. Each technique will accomplish the process for which it \n\nis best suited. Acid catalysis is relatively fast for esterification of FFA, so it is used as a \n\npretreatment for the high FFA feedstocks to reduce the level of FFA to 0.5-3.0 %, or lower. \n\nThen an alkali catalyst is added to convert the triglycerides to biodiesel. Although this \n\nprocess can convert high FFA feedstocks quickly and effectively, water formation is still a \n\nproblem during the pretreatment phase. An addition of a large excess of methanol during \n\nthe pretreatment can dilute the water produced to the level where it does not limit the \n\nreaction although this approach will still hamper the separation process.  \n\nTransesterification can also be carried out enzymatically. Lipases can be used as \n\ncatalyst in a solvent-free system to produce biodiesel. It is more appropriate for the \n\nproduction of biodiesel from feedstocks containing high FFA and water because the free \n\nfatty acids are directly esterified into biodiesel [25]. The immobilization of lipase could \n\nenhance the biodiesel yield. Many studies have been focused on optimizing the reaction \n\nconditions (solvent, temperature, pH, type of microorganism that generates the enzyme, \n\netc.) in order to establish suitable characteristics for an industrial application [27]. Table \n\n1.2 shows the comparison of the three different transesterification process here described.  \n\nTable 1 2.

The transesterification reaction occurs in a reactor with the oil reacting with \n\nthe methanol, in the presence of a catalyst, to produce methyl esters and glycerol. These \n\nproducts then form two phases at the outlet of reactor. The aqueous phase is rich in \n\nglycerol and the organic phase in fatty esters. The unreacted methanol is distributed \n\nbetween them. After reaction, the aqueous phase is sent to the alcohol recovery section \n\n(section 1) to recover and to purify the glycerol for posterior sale in the market (section 2). \n\nThe removal of excess alcohol from the methyl esters stream leaving the transesterification \n\nreactor can be performed by flash evaporation or distillation. The organic phase containing \n\nmethyl esters is washed with acidified water to neutralize the catalyst. The washed product \n\nis then dried to reduce the water content to an acceptable value by the biodiesel required \n\nstandards (section 3). \n\n \n\nFigure 1 3. Representative flow sheet of an industrial biodiesel production and purification \nprocess [28] \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n \n\n1.2.2. Practical Concerns: Pros and Cons \n\n \n\n1.2.2.1. Pros viewpoints  \n\nAs a fuel, biodiesel offers several economic, environmental and technical benefits \n\nlike ready availability, portability, renewability, domestic origin, lower sulfur and aromatic \n\ncontent, biodegradability, better ignition quality, inherent lubricity, higher cetane number, \n\npositive energy balance, greater safety, nontoxic character of the exhaust emissions and \n\ncleaner burning [15, 23, 29-35] when compared to diesel fuel. Biodiesel degrades, \n\nhowever, four times faster than diesel. In pure state it degrades 80-88 % in water after 22-\n\n28 days [36]. It is nonflammable and non-explosive; with a flash point of 423 K compared \n\nto 337 K for petrodiesel (a higher flash point leads to safe handling and storage). \n\nFurthermore, it is miscible with petrodiesel in any proportion and can be used in the \n\nconventional diesel engine with no modification [35, 37-40] because of the great molecular \n\nsimilarities of biodiesel to paraffinic diesel fuel compounds [39]. Indeed, biodiesel is most \n\noften blended with petroleum diesel in ratios of 2 % (B2), 5 % (B5), or 20 % (B20). It can, \n\nnevertheless, also be used as pure biodiesel (B100) [16]. \n\nRegarding the emissions, neat biodiesel (B100) reduces carbon dioxide emissions \n\nby more than 75 % over petroleum diesel, while a B20 reduces carbon dioxide emissions \n\nby 15 % [41, 42]. Biodiesel also can reduce carbon monoxide by 20 %, unburned \n\nhydrocarbon by 30 % and particulate matter by 40 %. Other types of emissions like sulphur \n\ndioxide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nitric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are \n\nalso reduced by appreciable magnitudes [1, 42, 43]. Only NOx emissions increase about \n\n10-15 %, compared to that of petrodiesel, because biodiesel contains 10-11 % of oxygen \n\n[43-45]. Reductions in NOx tend to be accompanied by increases in particulate emissions \n\nand fuel consumption [19]. It can be reduced, however, by retarding the injection time [46] \n\nor using exhaust gas recirculation [47]. \n\nBeyond the advantages aforementioned, if the development of biodiesel does not \n\nharm the ecosystems, it can provide new labor and market opportunities related to \n\nproduction of domestic crops and their further processing into biodiesel and decreases the \n\ncountry\u2019s dependence on imported petroleum or refined products [48]. This enables \n\ncountries with no petroleum resources to join the fuel market, auto sustain their energy \n\nneeds and reduce unemployment.  \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n \n\n1.2.2.2.  Cons Viewpoints \n\nSustainability is the key to the decision. As required for the petroleum fuels, the \n\nproduction of biodiesels must also be sustainable. So far the development of biodiesel, \n\nhowever, is still facing challenges including feedstock bottleneck and quality issues.  \n\nFirst, in most cases, biodiesel production is not truly green, renewable nor \n\nenvironmentally friendly because it still uses methanol derived from petroleum (10 % of \n\nthe feedstock input) and the synthetic catalysts used for the transesterification process are \n\nsulfuric acid, sodium or potassium hydroxide, which are highly caustic and toxic [49].  \n\nSecond, the dilemma fuel vs. food always remains alive in the third world countries \n\nwhere the concerns about the risk of diverting farmland or crops for biodiesel production in \n\ndetriment of the food supply are seriously analysed, namely when the edibles oils are used \n\nfor the purpose. Many voices claim that edible oils are more important for feeding human \n\nthan for running vehicles. This reality makes the price of biodiesel feedstocks soaring and \n\nthe production economically non-viable compared to that of diesel fuel. Note that in recent \n\nyears about more than 85 % of the costs of biodiesel production are field up in feedstock \n\ncosts [46], placing the marketability of biodiesel in constant equation. Beyond that, \n\necologically, conversion of natural habitats into monocultures diminishes biodiversity and \n\nreduces the natural carbon sink capacity. Converting native ecosystems to biodiesel \n\nproduction frequently causes much greater net green house gas releases over a long period \n\nthan the combustion of an energy-equivalent amount of petroleum diesel would do [50].  \n\nThird, some properties of biodiesel need to be improved to achieve high quality. \n\nThe higher kinematic viscosity, higher cloud point and pour point [51], lower oxidation \n\nstability, hygroscopicity [26], lower calorific value, lower effective engine power, higher \n\nemission of NOx, reactivity of unsaturated hydrocarbon chains [52] and greater sensitivity \n\nto low temperatures [1] may still compromise the quality of biodiesel and consequently the \n\nengine performance and exhaust emissions [53]. These properties are generally influenced \n\nby the quality of feedstock (chain length, branching and degree of saturation) and \n\nefficiency of biodiesel production and processing. In any situation, the presence of \n\nimpurities in biodiesel, either due to side-reactions, unreacted feedstock, or non-fatty acid \n\nconstituents, may increase pollutants [38, 53]. So, the target is to ensure that the neat \n\nbiodiesel obeys the specifications presented in Table 1.3 for some properties. \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n \n\nTable 1 3.

HHV for biodiesel is \n\nonly circa 12 % less than that of petrodiesel (46 MJ/kg), meaning that it is worthy to use \n\nbiodiesel as fuel. \n\n \n\nFigure 1 4. Kinematic viscosity for several biodiesel fuels [18] \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 5. Gross heat combustion (GH) of several biodiesel fuels [18] \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n1.2.2.3. Approaches to the challenges \n\nMany efforts have been developed to delineate the beneficial solutions for the \n\nchallenges of biodiesel development. If the use of virgin edible oils is expensive and \n\ncompetes with the food supply, then the use of low cost feedstocks and the development of \n\nother alternative sources in marginal lands are strongly recommended, not only to increase \n\nthe economic viability of biodiesel, but also the potential supply of this fuel. In this regard, \n\nmany researches have been focused on the use of waste frying oils, animal fats, microbial \n\noils and non-edible oils which are not suitable for human consumption and can be \n\ndeveloped in nonarable lands [16]. However, given the low cost feedstocks have the \n\nrelatively higher amounts of free fatty acids and water content, additional processing steps \n\nare required to remove any water and either the free fatty acids or soap from the reaction \n\nmixture to ensure that the final net biodiesel possess required properties. Only the decrease \n\nin the feedstock costs will affirmatively reduce to an acceptable value the great divergence \n\nbetween the prices of biodiesel and diesel fuel.  \n\nThe choice of source for biodiesel production and also the reagents used in the \n\ntransesterification process (if they are green or not), however, is made according to the \n\navailability and cost in each of the producing countries. Indeed for a given production line, \n\nthe comparison of the feedstocks should include issues like cultivation practices, \n\navailability of land and land use practices, use of resources, soil erosion, contribution to \n\nbiodiversity and landscape value losses, direct economic value of the feedstocks taking \n\ninto account the co-products, creation or maintenance of employment and water \n\nrequirements and water availability among others [51]. In any case the statistics show that \n\ntoday more than 95 % of the world biodiesel is produced from edible oils [51]. \n\nCountries like USA and those belonging to European Union are self-dependent in \n\nproduction of edible oils and even have surplus amount to export. Hence, edible oils such \n\nas soybean and rapeseed are mostly used in USA and European Union, respectively. \n\nHowever the use of edible oils to produce biodiesel in Africa and other developing \n\ncountries is not feasible because of the huge gap between the demand and the supply of \n\nsuch oils in the developing world [25]. For example India is a net importer of edible oil to \n\nmeet the food requirements, hence the emphasis of biodiesel is on non-edible oils from \n\nplants such as Jatropha, karanja, neem, mahua, simarouba, etc [20, 45]. \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n1.3. Energy Context in Timor Leste \n\n \n\n1.3.1. Current Status and development \n\nThe provision of reliable, affordable and clean energy is crucial for alleviating \n\npoverty and deprivation because energy is the base of human life. This policy is still not \n\neasy to implement in Timor Leste, making the country a picture of contrasts during a \n\ndecade of independence. On the one hand, it has abundant fossil and renewable resources \n\ncapable of providing fuels and electricity to the whole country like oil, natural gas, water, \n\nsun, wind and biomass. If so far the renewable energies are still ongoing projects, the \n\nundersea oil and gas have been developed for years by Australia and in return Timor Leste \n\nreceives the revenues by 90 % from the Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA) and 50 \n\n% from the entire Greater Sunrise field according to the treaty of Certain Maritime \n\nArrangements in the Timor Sea (CMAT) as exemplified in Figure 1.6 [54]. The revenues \n\nmade the Timorese Petroleum Fund achieve circa $12 billion in 2012, from which 4.6 % \n\nwas used to support the 2013 General State Budget, i.e., an amount lower than that used in \n\nthe 2012 State Budget (6.7 %) but still higher than that of Estimated Sustainable Income \n\n(3.0 %) [55].  \n\n \n\nFigure 1 6. Undersea oil and gas resources of Timor Leste [54] \n\nOn the other hand, the country still lacks energy and remains a slave to poverty and \n\ndeprivation. In the sector of electricity generation, the rural territories are not yet electrified \n\nas only 58 isolated diesel-powered generators are producing about 40 MWatt of electricity \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n \n\nto the whole country [56]. Moreover, the existing electricity grid continues to use imported \n\nfuels. In the sector of transportation, the cars still use Indonesian gasoline and diesel. In the \n\nresidential sector, most households still use candle, kerosene, battery, solar panel and small \n\ngasoline generators to service their energy needs. The poorest households use regularly \n\nwood fire as their primary energy for cooking and lighting. For example, in 2006 about \n\n98.3% of households used woods for cooking (Table1.4) and only 0.8 % got electricity \n\nfrom diesel power generators [57]. In short, it can be said that the struggle for the \n\nalleviation of poverty remains so far a complicated mission for Timor Leste, obliging the \n\nrural population to live poor and deprived of access to basic services and decent living \n\nconditions. It is noted that 49.9 % of population live below the poverty line and 38.7 % in \n\nthe severe poverty [58], despite the Gross Domestic product per capita of $1393 reported \n\nin 2011 and the increase of 2.71 % of Human Index Development (HID) in 2012 from \n\n2000 [58], standing this as a proof that economic growth does not always expresses the \n\npoverty reduction. \n\nTable 1 4. Source of energy used for cooking in 2006 [57] \n\nEnergy source Urban (%) Rural (%) All areas (%) \n\nFuel-wood 98.3 98.9 98.7 \n\nAgricultural residues 0.5 0.4 0.4 \n\nCharcoal 0.5 0.7 0.7 \n\nKerosene 9.2 1.6 3.0 \n\nElectricity  1.2 0.7 0.8 \n\nThis controversial scenario happens because of two possible reasons among others. \n\nFirst, the country still has very low social capital, technology and know-how to mine its \n\nown resources and revenues without foreign aids. So during the period of independence, \n\nTimorese government has been investing intensively on education and skills. The public \n\nspending in education was 14 % of GDP in 2010 from 2005 [58]. Second, in 1999 the \n\nIndonesian troops and pro-integration militia destroyed about 70 % of the economic \n\ninfrastructure including all power sector assets, administrative buildings, power stations, \n\npower lines, and associated records and documentation, solar panels and connection boxes \n\nat individual home installations, obliging the country to reform all the institutions and \n\ninfrastructures from the scratch during the period of independence. The truth is that before \n\nthe independency, 28.7 % of all Timorese villages were already electrified and about 70 % \n\nof the households in the electrified villages were connected to the grid [59].  \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n \n\nTo remedy the aforementioned challenges, the Timorese government created \n\nrecently a called Strategic Development Plan (SDP) for 20 years whose priorities also \n\ninclude developing the renewable energy sources like biogas, hydropower, solar panel, \n\nwind power and biomass-based energy, beyond bringing the petroleum or natural gas \n\ndevelopment from the sea, through pipelines, to the south coast of Timor-Leste under the \n\nTasi Mane (male sea) project (Figure1.7). The target is to improve the electrification rate \n\nby 2015 (i.e., everybody will have access to electricity during 24 h) and to satisfy by 2020 \n\nhalf of the national energy needs with the renewable energy sources and the energy needs \n\nof 100000 families with solar energy as the rates of daily global sunlight in entire territory \n\nof Timor Leste are always between 14.85 and 22.33 MJ/m\u00b2 per day [56]. \n\nThe Tasi Mane Project is planned to start in 2015 and to end in 2030, exactly when \n\nthe number of Timorese population doubles [58]. The success of this project, however, also \n\ndepends on the decision of Australia as the Greater Sunrise project is currently operated by \n\nWoodside, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell and Osaka Gas companies. Anyway, so far, \n\nthe project continues to be a matter of negotiation between Australia and Timor Leste.  \n\n \n\nFigure 1 7. Male Sea project  [56] \n\n.  \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n \n\n1.3.2. Prospect of biodiesel development  \n\nSince the fossil projects take time to bring benefits to Timor Leste, the development \n\nof renewable energy is at present an urgent mission and an adequate solution to improve \n\nthe electrification rate and mainly to create jobs for Timorese people. Thereat, among the \n\nexisting renewable energies, biodiesel production has been widely discussed in the country \n\nsince 2008. The biggest concern linked to this project is about choosing feedstocks without \n\ncompromising the food supply as circa 80 % of Timorese population is subsistence \n\nfarmers. Fortunately, the Timorese lands offer solutions to avoid the confrontation between \n\nfood supply and biodiesel production. Beyond some agroforestry wastes, there are \n\noleaginous plants like Jatropha curcas (Ahi oan metan in Tetum and pinh\u00e3o manso in \n\nPortuguese) and Aleurites moluccana (Kam\u00ed in Tetum and Nogueira de Iguap\u00e9 in \n\nPortuguese) that produce oils useful for biodiesel production without compromising the \n\nfood security.  \n\nJatropha curcas belongs to the family of Euforbiaceae (Figure1.8). It has normally \n\na height not superior to 3 m. It requires little water and fertilizer and can grow in arid, \n\nmarginal and poor lands, is resistant to pests, produces over 30 to 40 years and the seed has \n\na high oil content (30-40 %), which is toxic and may not be suitable for human or animal \n\nconsumption [60]. It is abundant in the Timorese lands and given the current social and \n\nenvironmental situation, its cultivation could contribute to the reforestation of large areas \n\nof the country, reduce soil erosion and allow the economic exploitation of marginal lands \n\nuseless for conventional agriculture and create jobs.  \n\n \n\nFigure 1 8. Fruits and seeds of Jatropha curcas \n\nAleurites moluccana also belongs to the family of Euforbiaceae (Figure 1.9). It is \n\nan arborescent plant of 20 to 30 feet high, but sometimes as high as 100 feet [61]. It can \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n \n\ngrow in all kinds of terrain, particularly in tropical climates. Its lipid-containing kernel has \n\nbeen used for illumination, pharmaceuticals, and seasonings, while its seed covered with a \n\nhard shell has been used for children\u2019s toys or ritual offerings [62]. The seeds contain \n\nabout 60 % oil. Sulistyo et al [63] already studied at laboratory scale about the viability of \n\nproducing biodiesel from the oil of Aleurites moluccana. \n\n \n\nFigure 1 9. Fruits and seeds of Aleurites moluccana \n\nAs Timor Leste has adequate lands and good climatic condition to promote the \n\ncultivation of these plants to be sources of biodiesel production, Timorese government \n\ntook on the challenge to explore and strengthen the Jatropha production with foreign \n\ncompanies. This effort aimed to set Timor Leste at the forefront of the Southeast Asia \n\nbiofuel producers and mainly create many jobs in Timor Leste. With this in mind, the \n\nEnviroenergy Developments Australia (EDA) Company and Daba-Loqui, a Timorese \n\ncompany, signed in 2005 a deal to develop Jatropha plantations in Timor-Leste and other \n\nterritories aiming at building an oil extraction plant in Timor-Leste to extract oil from \n\nseeds of the Jatropha plant for biodiesel production. The agreement was again updated in \n\n2008 by Timor Leste, giving to the EDA Company a possibility to access to 59 hectares of \n\nindustrial land on the waterfront at Carabella (Baucau) and to purchase for a 30 year lease, \n\nwith options to renew for an additional 60 years. The seeds of Jatropha would also be \n\nimported from Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and India. The installation of \n\nBiodiesel Extraction and Refining Facility, Jatropha Pellet Facility and Jatropha Pellet \n\nPlant would require an estimated capital investment of $550 million dollars over 10 years. \n\nThe target was to produce 100 million liters of biodiesel oil per year in Timor and to build \n\na biomass power plant at Carabella, as well as a waste treatment facility and potable water \n\nsupply plant [64]. \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n \n\nRegarding Aleurites moluccana there is no plan yet about using its oil to produce \n\nbiodiesel. The use of the seeds for seasoning is common for Indonesia but it is not for \n\nTimor Leste. So the actual final oil extracted by Acelda Company since 2006 in Baucau is \n\nexported to Hawaii for cosmetic purposes.  \n\nTimor Leste also has abundant coffee plantations especially in the occidental part of \n\nthe country. It has been crucial to the country\u2019s overall economy and has served as the \n\nprimary source of income for about 25 % of the country\u2019s population [65]. The discovery \n\nof Nevada researches about producing biodiesel from the coffee waste oil (10-15%) [66] \n\nwill value the Timorese coffee in the international market. After all, coffee is not only for \n\nbeverage but could also be used for biofuel production.   \n\n \n\n1.4. Scopes, objectives and organization of this thesis \n\nThis thesis emphasizes globally the rising trend of biodiesel in the international fuel \n\nmarket as alternative fuel for diesel engines and specifically its prospects in Timor Leste. \n\nThis biofuel has gained a prominent place in the arena of energy, as already introduced \n\nabove, because petroleum resources are increasingly limited, constantly soaring and \n\nsustainability stays frequently in a complex equation namely for the oil-importing \n\ncountries. Biodiesel can ensure, to them, energy security, economic growth, environmental \n\nsafety and human-wellbeing as its benefits constitute a potential therapy for the \n\nuncertainties of petroleum fuels. For Timor Leste, the expectation is that, the development \n\nof a biodiesel refinery will contribute to the alleviation of poverty and deprivation and \n\npossibly will place the country at the forefront of biodiesel producers without jeopardizing \n\nthe environmental wellbeing. The erection of a biodiesel refinery is adequate to the actual \n\nsocial context of Timor Leste because, the revenues from the undersea fossil resources still \n\ndo not be a Messiah for the country.  \n\nHowsoever, to be used as a fuel, pure or blended with petrodiesel, biodiesel must \n\nhave good quality. So, the study of thermodynamic properties is important for the \n\noptimization of the production and processing of biodiesel. Unfortunately, the exhaustive \n\ninformation about them is still scant much less at the working conditions of the diesel \n\nengines. Thereat, the aims of this thesis cover two key-issues: production/processing of \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n \n\nbiodiesel fuels and measurement/prediction of thermodynamic properties of biodiesel (also \n\nfeed oils and fatty esters). These key-issues are incorporated in five main chapters: \n\nChapter 1 is the general introductory chapter that already highlighted the global \n\nframework of biodiesel potential in the international fuel market and specifically its \n\nprospect in Timor Leste for alleviating poverty and deprivation.  \n\nChapter 2 will focus especially on the importance of lipase as catalyst for the \n\nproduction of biodiesel. It presents mainly the basic informations about improving the \n\nlipase production in the fermentation of bacteria Bacillus sp. ITP-001 using several oxygen \n\nvectors and inducers.  \n\nChapter 3 will address the measurement and prediction of thermodynamic \n\nproperties of biodiesel, feed oils and fatty esters that compose biodiesel. So it will expose, \n\nbeyond the experimental data of several properties (such as density, viscosity, surface \n\ntension, volatility, speed of sound both at wide range of temperatures and pressures), the \n\npredictive models capable of computing the experimental data.  \n\nChapter 4 will concern the use of soft-SAFT Equation of State for prediction of the \n\nthermodynamic properties of fatty esters and biodiesels like density, surface tension, speed \n\nof sound and viscosity at wide range of temperatures and pressures.  \n\nChapter 5 will report the production of biodiesel from oils endogenous of Timor \n\nLeste (Jatropha curcas, Aleurites moluccana and coffee waste) and also the evaluation of \n\ntheir thermophysical properties using the models already studied in Chapter 3.  \n\nChapter 6 and so on will set out the general conclusions, concluding remarks and \n\nfuture works.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\nProduction of lipase by the fermentation of Bacillus sp. \n\nITP-001 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nThis chapter discusses in particular the production of lipase by the submerged \n\nfermentation of Bacillus sp. ITP-001. The initial goal of this part of work was to produce, \n\nseparate, purify and immobilize lipase for posterior use as catalyst in the enzymatic \n\nsynthesis of biodiesel. However, as the processing of lipase did not reach the final stage \n\nand the enzymatic transesterification was not performed, this chapter only reports the \n\nresults linked to the production of lipase namely to the effects of inducers (i.e., vegetable \n\noils) and oxygen vectors (perfluorodecalina, dodecane and particles of silica) on lipase \n\nactivity.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n \n\n2.1. Introduction \n \n\nEnzymes are innovative solutions for many bioconversion processes as they work \n\nat expense of mild reaction conditions, low energy demand, decrease in side reactions, high \n\ndegree of specificity and simplicity of post-recovery [67]. Of all known enzymes, lipases \n\n(triacylglycerol acylhydrolase, E.C.3.1.3) have attracted most attention due to their broad \n\nindustrial applications. They catalyze hydrolysis of carboxylic ester bonds and organic \n\nsynthesis such as esterification, interesterification, alcoholysis, acidolysis and aminolysis \n\n[67-69]. Microbial lipases, mainly bacterial and fungal, represent the most widely used \n\nenzymes in biotechnological applications and organic chemistry because of their diversity \n\nin catalytic activity, high yield and low cost production, as well as relative ease of genetic \n\nmanipulation [70]. Moreover, they are stable in organic solvents, do not require cofactors \n\nand accept a broad range of substrate (i.e., aliphatic, alicyclic, bicyclic and aromatic esters, \n\nthioesters and activated amines) whilst maintaining high regio-, chemo- and \n\nenantioselectivity [71]. This versatility makes microbial lipases of choice for potential \n\napplications in the food, detergent, pharmaceutical, textile, leather, cosmetic, paper \n\nindustries (for pitch control), waste treatment (breakdown of fat solids) and biodiesel \n\nproduction [67]. \n\nThe efficiency of lipase production, in solid state fermentation by fungi or in \n\nsubmerged fermentation by bacteria, depends on strain, nutritional and physico-chemical \n\nfactors such as growth media composition (nitrogen and carbon sources), presence of \n\nlipids, inorganic salts and cultivation conditions (pH, temperature, agitation and dissolved \n\noxygen concentration\u2013for aerobic microorganism) [72]. Since lipases are inducible \n\nenzymes, their activity is only known in the presence of inducers like oils, lipids and fatty \n\nacids [73-77]. In aerobic cultures, i.e., when a supply of oxygen is a limiting factor, a high \n\nyield is only achieved with a good aeration, which depends greatly on oxygen solubility in \n\nthe media and diffusion rate into the broths to satisfy the oxygen demand of microbial \n\npopulation. Unfortunately oxygen, unlike other nutrients, is poorly soluble in aqueous \n\nmedia. The solubility of oxygen in water is just 7.95 mg/L\n \n at 30 \u00baC [78]. \n\nThe conventional approach to overcome this limitation involves improved \n\nbioreactor design, agitator and sparger as well as the use of oxygen-enriched air. Other \n\nsolutions may include the manipulation of microbial metabolism through genetic \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n \n\nengineering [79]. A novel approach is the use of water-insoluble oxygen vectors in which \n\noxygen has a greater solubility such as hydrocarbons [80], perfluorocarbons (PFCs) [81, \n\n82], natural and synthetic oils [83] and functionalized magnetic nanoparticles [84]. Beyond \n\nenhancing the oxygen transfer rate, without the need for extra energy supply, and \n\npreventing foam formation [85], these can act as surface active agents to lower the surface \n\ntension of water and increase the gaseous specific interfacial area [86]. Moreover, oxygen \n\nvectors avoid the damage of cells (especially mammalian cells) caused by mechanical \n\nagitation and air bubbles [87]. PFCs have been applied very successfully in the culture of \n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae [88], immobilized Streptomyces coelicolor [89], insect cells and \n\nvirus-infected insect cells [90] and Yarrowia lypolytica [82, 91]. They are petroleum-based \n\ncompounds synthesized by substituting the hydrocarbons hydrogen atoms by fluorine. Due \n\nto the presence of very strong carbon-fluorine bonds they are non-toxic towards the cells, \n\nstable and chemically inert [82]. Their interesting peculiarity is their high solubility of \n\ngases. Oxygen solubility in PFCs is 10-20 times higher than that in pure water [92, 93]. \n\nFurthermore due to the low solubility of PFCs in water [94], there is no change in the \n\nproperties of the aqueous phase, while an increase on the oxygen mass transfer is achieved \n\n[95] leading to the enhanced performance of the process with an easy recovery of PFCs at \n\nthe end of fermentation. Beside PFCs, some immiscible organic solvents have also been \n\nused with success in fermentation process as oxygen vectors. N-dodecane has been used in \n\nthe culture of Crypthecodinium cohnii fermentations and DHA production [96] and in the \n\nproduction of L-asparaginase by Escherichia coli [85]. Karimi et al [97] evaluated the \n\ncapacity of silicon oil to increase the oxygen transfer coefficient (KLa) in the treatment of \n\ngas containing benzene, toluene and xylene and found that silicon oil was only beneficial \n\nto the process at low concentration. The ability of some suspended hydrophobic particles to \n\nenhance the mass transfer were also tested in the adsorption of surfactants where, at low \n\nsolid loadings, these particles increased significantly the mass transfer rates [98]. \n\nThis work aims to evaluate the ability of oils of coconut, Aleurites moluccana, \n\nJatropha curcas and coffee waste as inducers, and the capability of perfluorodecaline, n-\n\ndodecane, silica particles and silicon oil as oxygen vectors, to improve the lipase \n\nproduction by Bacillus sp. ITP-001. As aforementioned, so far only two works [76, 77] \n\nreported the use of this strain to produce lipase, but without oxygen vectors. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n \n\n2.2. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n2.2.1. Inducers \n\nOils of Aleurites moluccana and Jatropha curcas were obtained by solid-liquid \n\nextraction of the corresponding seeds in a Soxlet unit with 250 mL of n-hexane. Coffee \n\nwaste oil was obtained by the same process from the wastes collected at the University of \n\nAveiro while coconut oil was purchased from Brazilian market. These oils were always \n\nsterilized in autoclave at 121 \u00baC before being added in 4 % of volume fraction to the \n\nculture media. \n\n2.2.2. Oxygen vectors \n\nPerfluorodecaline was purchased from F2 Chemicals Limited. N-dodecane of 99 % \n\npurity and silicon oil were purchased from Sigma. These liquids were always sterilized by \n\nfiltration through 0.45 \u00b5m filters and saturated with oxygen before being added to all \n\nexperiments at inoculation time. Two types of silica particles were used. Particles of silica \n\nA were produced in our laboratory with circa 200 nm of diameter while silica B, \n\nnanoparticles of silica with 10 nm of diameter, was purchased from Sigma. The particles of \n\nsilica A were synthesized following the Stober method that is based on the hydrolysis of \n\ntetra-alkyl silicate in homogeneous alcoholic medium using ammonia as a catalyst [99]. \n\n2.2.3. Strain and media \n\nBacillus sp. ITP-001 was isolated from soil with a history of contact with \n\npetroleum. It was maintained in nutrient agar tubes and stored at 4 \u00b0C. The culture media \n\nconsisted of (% w/v): starch (2.0), peptone (0.13), yeast extract (0.6), MgSO4.7H2O (0.05), \n\nNaNO3 (0.3), KH2PO4 (0.1), triton X-100 (2.0). The media was always adjusted to pH 5.0 \n\nand then sterilized in the autoclave at 121 \u00b0C for 22 minutes. \n\n2.2.4. Cultivation conditions \n\nThe experiments were carried out in 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks on an orbital shaker \n\nat 32 \u00b0C. Each flask was filled with 100 mL of culture media. To this, a known amount of \n\nthe oxygen vector was added, before being inoculated with 10 % (v/v) of an inoculum of \n\n48 h old. At 72 h of fermentation, the inducer was added to the broth and the culture was \n\ncarried up to 168 h. \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n \n\n \n\n2.2.5. Analysis \n\n \n\n2.2.5.1. Lipase activity assay \n\nThe lipase activity was assayed in accordance with the methodology of Soares et al \n\n[76, 77] using olive oil as substrate. This was initially prepared as an emulsion of olive oil \n\nand water (50:50) with arabic gum (7 %). Then 2 mL of sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, \n\npH 7.0) were added to 5 mL of this emulsion. This mixture was stirred at 100 rpm on an \n\norbital shaker at 37 \u00b0C. An aliquot of 1 mL of enzyme solution was added and the reaction \n\noccurred for 5 min. A sample of 0.33 mL of reaction solution was withdrawn and added to \n\n2 mL of acetanolic solution (water: ethanol: acetone, 1:1:1) to stop the reaction. This \n\nmixture was then titrated with a potassium hydroxide solution using phenolphthalein as \n\nindicator. One unit of enzyme activity (U) was defined as the amount of enzyme that \n\nliberates one \u00b5mol of free fatty acids per minute (\u00b5mol/min) under the assay conditions.  \n\n \n\n2.2.5.2. Cell biomass, protein and starch \n\nCell growth biomass was measured by using centrifugation (2500 rpm, 10 min) \n\nfollowed by drying in the oven (105 \u00baC) until constant weight. Biomass was expressed as \n\nmg of cell dry weight per millilitre. Analyses of protein and starch were performed \n\naccording to the Bradford method [100] and Soccol method [101] respectively.  \n\n2.2.5.3. Emulsion stability \n\nThe emulsion stability was measured according to the method of Lima et al [102]. \n\nThe emulsion was prepared by mixing 50 ?L of oil with 12.5 mL of the culture media. \n\nThis mixture was then shaken during two minutes at room temperature and paused for 10 \n\nmin before reading its absorbance at 540 nm over time. The blank contained only the \n\nculture media. The decay constant (kd) is the slope of the ln (Abs) versus time. The lower \n\nthe value of this parameter the higher the stability of the emulsion. \n\n2.2.5.4. Experimental design and statistical analysis \n\nTo study the effect of perfluorodecaline concentration and agitation rate on lipase \n\nproduction, an Experimental Design of 2\n2 \n\nfactorial with three replications at the central \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n \n\npoint was carried. The experimental data were then analyzed with Statistica\n\u00ae\n\n, version 7.0 \n\nto obtain surface response and Pareto diagram. \n\n2.2.5.5. Kinetic parameters \n\nSome kinetic parameters namely the specific rate of growth (\u00b5 in h\n-1\n\n); the specific \n\nrates of substrate consumption and product formation (qs and qp in g/(g.h) and the yield \n\nfactors of dry cell biomass and protein (YX/S and YP/S in g/g) were determined at the \n\nconditions of maximum productivity of lipase using the Eqs. 2.1- 2.5, where X, S and P \n\nrepresent biomass, substrate (starch) and product (enzyme) respectively.  \n\n          (2.1) \n\n          (2.2) \n\n          (2.3) \n\n          (2.4) \n\n          (2.5) \n\n \n\n2.3. Results and discussion \n\n \n\n2.3.1. Effect of inducers \n\nAs mentioned above, lipase activity in the fermentation broth is only observed in \n\npresence of an inducer that can be oil or a fatty acid. Thereat, many works have studied the \n\ninfluence of vegetables oils and fatty acids in various fermentation processes. Dalmau et al \n\n[73] and Lakshami et al [74] reported that the highest yields of enzyme were obtained with \n\nlipids or fatty acids as carbon sources where the amount of lipase secreted correlated well \n\nwith the relative percentage of C18:n fatty acid esters, namely oleic acid (C18:1), present \n\nin the respective oils. Obradors et al [75] also observed that C18:1 as inducer was \n\nbeneficial for lipase production by Candida rugosa. Only Makhzoum et al [103] found a \n\nrepressing effect of C18:1 on the production of lipase by Pseudomonas Fluroescens 2D. \n\nThese results show that the ability of inducers to improve lipase production depends also \n\non the type of strain used. Certain inducers can be beneficial for a strain but prejudicial for \n\nothers.  \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n \n\nThis work evaluated the induction ability of four different oils (coconut oil, coffee \n\nwaste oil, Aleurites moluccana oil and Jatropha curcas oil) on lipase production by \n\nBacillus sp. ITP-001. The cultivation occurred at 200 rpm and the amount of oil used was 4 \n\n% (v/v). The run with coconut oil (without oxygen vector) was used as control. This strain \n\nwas already used in previous works by Carvalho et al [76] to evaluate the induction ability \n\nof coconut oil, olive oil and castor oil, having obtained the lipase activity of 1675, 1200 \n\nand 1400 U/mL ,respectively and by Feitosa et al [77] that achieved 4370 U/mL of lipase \n\nactivity using palm oil. \n\nIn this work, when coconut oil was used as inducer, the maximum lipase activity \n\nobtained was 1642 U/mL which is consistent with that reported by Carvalho et al [76] \n\n(1675 U/mL). The corresponding maximum biomass (0.36 mg/mL), however, was much \n\nhigher than that of Carvalho (~0.070 mg/mL), evincing that, although lipase is a growth - \n\nassociated product, there is no linear correlation between cell growth and lipase production \n\nby the strain here used. Using other oils, the lipase activities obtained were 2249, 2112 and \n\n1630 U/mL, respectively for coffee waste oil, Aleurites moluccana oil and Jatropha curcas \n\noil. Figure 2.1 shows the profile of lipase activity over the fermentation time for the four \n\ninducers studied. The maximum lipase activity was obtained between 120 and 144 h of \n\nfermentation time. \n\n \n\nFigure 2 1. Profile of lipase activity for four inducers used in the culture of Bacillus sp. ITP-001.  \n\nCoconut oil,   coffee waste oil,  Aleurites moluccana oil and   Jatropha curcas oil \n\nSo far it is known that inducers are important for the production of lipase, some \n\nbeing better than others. Instead of using the oil composition to discuss the results as some \n\nworks did, in this work we used the emulsion stability, represented by the decay constant \n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n0 24 48 72 96 120 144 168 192\n\nL\nA\n\n, \n(U\n\n/m\nL\n\n)\n\nt, h\n\nInducer addition \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n \n\n(kd), to justify the discrepancy in lipase activities between the inducers based on the \n\nprinciple that only a stable emulsion reduces the size of oil drops and the respective surface \n\ntension in water-oil to enable the better contact with microorganism and consequently \n\nguarantee an easy assimilation of respective oil as carbon source for the bacteria. Table 2.1 \n\nshows that coffee waste oil formed a stable emulsion with the media, presenting a smaller \n\nkd and thus higher lipase activity, followed by Aleurites moluccana oil and coconut oil \n\nwhile Jatropha curcas oil presented higher kd and lower relative lipase activity. So, the \n\norder of emulsion stability matters for the lipase production. In terms of relative values, \n\ncoffee waste oil increased the lipase activity about 37 % of the control and Aleurites \n\nmoluccana oil about 29 %. \n\nTable 2 1.

Influence of perfluorodecaline concentration and agitation rate \n\nSeveral works have reported the potential use of perfluorodecaline as oxygen vector \n\nin aerobic cultures. Elibol et al [79] included 50 % of perfluorodecaline in the culture of \n\nStreptomyces coelicolor A3(2) to increase the maximum antibiotic concentration by a 5-\n\nfold. Amaral et al [91] enhanced lipase production by Y. lipolytica by 23-fold at 250 rpm \n\nusing 20 % (v/v) PFC and 2 % (w/v) of glucose as substrate.  \n\nAiming to evaluate the influence of perfluorodecaline concentration (% v/v) and \n\nagitation rate (rpm) in the culture of Bacillus sp. ITP-001, this work used the Experimental \n\nDesign of 2\n2 \n\nfactorial with three replications at the central point to perform the experiments \n\nusing coconut oil as inducer. The results from here obtained were used to generate Pareto \n\ndiagram (Figure 2.2) which shows that agitation rate was the more influent parameter than \n\nperfluorodecaline concentration and the interaction between the parameters had a \n\nnegligible effect on lipase production. \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 2.

The response surface curve (Figure 2.3) addressed \n\nthe positive effect of both parameters, i.e., higher lipase activity is obtained at higher \n\nconcentration of perfluorodecaline and agitation rate. \n\n \n\nFigure 2 3.

ITP-\n\n001 were 20 % (v/v) of perfluorodecaline and 200 rpm of agitation rate (Table 2.3). At this \n\ncondition, the lipase activity was increased to circa 4-fold of control that is much lower \n\nthan the value observed by Amaral et al [90] with Y. Lipolytica. This difference shows that \n\nthe strains have different responses to the oxygen vectors. \n\nTable 2 3.

Influence of perfluorodecaline in presence of different inducers \n\nUsing the optimal operating conditions identified using the Experimental Design \n\ndescribed above, the effect of perfluorodecaline on lipase production were also studied in \n\npresence of several inducers namely oils of Aleurites moluccana, Jatropha curcas and \n\ncoffee waste. The results, shown in Table 2.4, indicate that the inclusion of 20 % (v/v) \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n \n\nperfluorodecaline in the culture media increased the lipase activity to more than 2-fold of \n\nthe control, for all inducers.  \n\nTable 2 4.

The \n\nresults, however, revealed that, in the presence of perfluorodecaline, coconut oil increased \n\nlipase activity to circa 4-fold of the control, even if it formed less stable emulsions when \n\ncompared with coffee waste oil. In cultures aerated by oxygen vectors the emulsion \n\nstability is no longer the only explanatory parameter for the inducer effect. Regarding the \n\ncell growth, as shown in Figure 2.4 below, the results support the absence of dependence \n\nbetween cell growth biomass and lipase activity for the culture of Bacillus sp. ITP-001. \n\n \n\nFigure 2 4. Profile of starch, dry cell biomass and lipase activity for the culture of Bacillus \nsp.ITP-001 at 200 RPM using 20 % C10F18 and 4 % (v/v) of coconut oil.

A situation of diauxia (sequential consumption of two substrates) was \n\nobserved even with low intensity.  \n\nThe kinetics parameters for the fermentation with several inducers in presence of \n\nperfluorodecaline were determined under conditions of maximum production of lipase and \n\nthe results are shown in Table 2.5.  \n\nTable 2 5.

The \n\nspecific rates of substrate consumption (qs) and product formation (qp), on the other hand, \n\nare dissimilar for the various inducers studied and the higher values were obtained for \n\ncoconut oil and coffee waste oil. This fact echoed in high yields of lipase (Yp/s) obtained \n\nwith these oils. Again the results indicate that there is no linear correlation between the cell \n\ngrowth biomass and the lipase production as even though the yield of biomass (Yx/s) is low \n\nfor coconut oil (0.079 g/g), the production of lipase is high (387.57 g/g). Theoretically, a \n\nlinear dependency of lipase production on cell growth biomass can be expressed by the \n\nmixed model of Luedeking et al [104] presented in Eq. (2.6) below, were ? and ? are the \n\nfitting parameters. Many works have reported lipase production to be a microbial growth \n\nassociated product. Puthli et al [105], for example, dealt with a linear dependency of lipase \n\nproduction on cell growth in the culture of Candida rugosa. \n\n               (2.6) \n\n However, the non association between cell growth and lipase production observed \n\nin this work is not an extraneous case and has been reported by other authors. Deive et al \n\n[106] studied the culture of aerobic Bacillus strain and verified that lipase production was \n\nfound not to be a microbial growth associated product. This situation happened when the \n\nlipase activity is detected just at the stationary growth phase. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n \n\n2.3.2.3. Influence of other oxygen vectors in presence of different inducers \n\n Other oxygen vectors like silica particles, n-dodecane and silicon oil were also \n\nevaluated in presence of coconut oil for their ability to improve lipase production by \n\nBacillus sp. ITP-001. The runs were carried at 200 rpm. Hydrophobic particles, n-dodecane \n\nand silicon oils were previously reported to enhance the mass transfer rates in some \n\nfermentation processes [97, 98].  \n\nUsing silica particles as oxygen vector, two different behaviors were observed. For \n\nthe larger particles (silica A), lipase activity increased for the lower silica concentrations \n\nup to 0.12 g and then decreased with the increasing amount of particles as shown in Table \n\n2.6. \n\nTable 2 6.

The opposite effect was observed for the smaller particles (silica B). For these \n\nthe lipase activity was severely compromised but recovered with the increasing amount of \n\nparticles in the culture media as shown in Table 2.7. \n\nTable 2 7.

An increase of around 11 % of in the \n\nlipase activity was observed with n-dodecane while Silicon oil, had a repressing effect on \n\nlipase production. Kaya et al [98] suggest that only concentrations below 10 % silicon oil \n\nare beneficial for increasing oxygen mass transfer. This may explain the poor result \n\nobserved on this work.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n \n\nTable 2 8.

Conclusions \n\nThe influence of various inducers and oxygen vectors on the production of lipase \n\nby Bacillus sp. ITP-001 was here studied. It is here shown that the production process can \n\nbe improved by using perfluorodecaline as oxygen vector and the optimal operating \n\nconditions here obtained were 20 % (v/v) of perfluorodecaline concentration and 200 rpm \n\nof agitation rate. At this conditions, perfluorodecaline increased the lipase activity to circa \n\n4-fold. Regarding other oxygen vectors, n-dodecane enhanced the lipase activity by about \n\n11 % and silica A by about 29 % while silicon oil and silica B had a repressing influence in \n\nlipase production. About the induction ability, without oxygen vectors, coffee waste oil \n\nwas better than other oils here studied due to its higher emulsion stability. In presence of \n\nperfluorodecaline, coconut oil revealed to be the best inducer and the emulsion stability \n\nceases to be the unique explanatory parameter.  \n\nIn all cases no direct correlation was observed between the cell growth biomass and \n\nlipase activity. The optimal conditions for lipase production seem thus to be using 20 % \n\n(v/v) of perfluorodecalin with coconut oil as inducer.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n \nThermodynamic properties of biodiesels, fatty esters and \n\nfeed oils: measurement and prediction  \n \n\n \n\n \n\nOne of the key-challenges linked to the use of biodiesel is that its properties may not be \n\nconcordant with those established in the standards. The knowledge of thermodynamic \n\nproperties becomes crucial for process modeling and product design of biodiesel \n\nmanufacturing. Thereat, this chapter provides experimental data of several properties like \n\ndensity, viscosity, vapor pressure, surface tension and speed of sound for biodiesel, fatty \n\nesters and also feed oils as well as methods capable of predicting them at a wide range of \n\ntemperatures and pressures. The ester nomenclature adopted throughout this chapter is \n\nbased on the fatty acid chain length. A Cx:y ester means the alkyl ester of fatty acid with \n\nx carbons and y unsaturations.  \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n \n\n3.1. Relevance of studying thermodynamic properties \n\nDespite the many promising advantages and merits that biodiesels can offer to \n\noverride the uncertainties of petrodiesel, to be used in diesel engines, however, their \n\nproperties must be coherent with those specified in the standards [107, 108] in order to \n\nguarantee suitable ignition, atomization and combustion of this fuel in diesel engines. This \n\nmeans that all the steps involved in the manufacturing of biodiesel, since the processing of \n\nfeedstocks (oils or fats) until the purification of the product, must be always carried out at \n\nthe optimum conditions. In this regard, the knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of \n\nbiodiesel, feed oils and fatty esters (that compose biodiesels) become crucial not only for \n\ndesigning the better technology for biodiesel manufacturing but also for enhancing the \n\nengine performance. \n\nThe knowledge of thermodynamic properties is also relevant for high-pressure \n\ntechnology. This, commonly coupled with thermal processing, has been used in many \n\nengineering applications such as in food processing to achieve stable food products, \n\nadditive free and microbiologically safe, as the constituents and the contaminants of food \n\ncan be controlled under this condition [109-113] and in the fuel industry to get low \n\npollutant levels and lower fuel consumption through the enhancement of combustion \n\nprocess using of the common rail fuel injection system [114-116]. High-pressures in the \n\nprocessing of vegetable oils are used for their extraction from the corresponding seeds, the \n\nfractionation of their constituents with supercritical fluids [117-119] and also for the \n\nproduction of biodiesels at near or supercritical conditions [120, 121]. \n\nThe supercritical fluid extraction of oil from seeds, in special, is already considered \n\nto be more beneficial than the conventional technology as it does not require the distillation \n\nand the solvent removal processes normally involved in the conventional extraction [122]. \n\nMoreover, the efficiency of the extraction is simply controlled by the pressure and/or the \n\ntemperature of operation , the contact time and the solubility of the oil in the extracting \n\nfluids [123]. This feature can be also applied for the extraction of oil constituents with \n\nsupercritical fluids as already addressed elsewhere in the literature [124, 125]. \n\nRegarding biodiesel, it is known that transesterification with supercritical alcohol \n\nconstitutes a better technical approach to the conventional catalytic transesterification of \n\nlow quality feedstocks [126] as the alkaline-catalyzed transesterification is very sensitive \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n \n\nto the purity of the reactants [127]. Moreover, the injection of biodiesel in diesel engines is \n\nusually done at very energetic conditions. This chapter aims to provide experimental data \n\nof several properties like density, viscosity, surface tension, vapor pressure and speed of \n\nsound either for biodiesel, fatty esters or feed oils and ultimately to recommend methods \n\ncapable of predicting each property at wide range of temperatures and pressures.  \n\nIn all studies, the predictive ability of the models studied is evaluated by simply \n\ncalculating the relative deviations (RDs) between predicted and experimental data \n\naccording to Eq. (3.1.1). Afterwards, the overall average relative deviation (OARD) was \n\ncalculated through Eq. (3.1.2), where Ns is the number of systems studied and the average \n\nrelative deviation (ARD) is the summation of the modulus of RD over Np experimental \n\ndata points.  \n\n? ? 100\nexp\n\nexp\n% ?\n\n?\n?\n\ni\n\nii\ncalc\n\nRD  (3.1.1)  \n\n? ?\ns\n\nn\n\nN\n\nARD\n\nOARD\n?\n\n?%  (3.1.2) \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n \n\n3.2. Measurement and prediction of biodiesel density \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.1.  Density of methylic biodiesels  \n\nThe production and the measurement of atmospheric density for ten methylic \n\nbiodiesel samples used in this work were carried out at our Laboratory by Dr. \n\nMaria Jorge Pratas. The complete work is already published as paper in the \n\njournal of Energy &amp; Fuels [128]. The fitting of the parameters for Revised \n\nGCVOL method was also done by her.  The measurement of high-pressure \n\ndensity was done in Spain at the University of Vigo by Prof. Manuel Pi\u00f1eiro \n\nand his group. This section only reports my direct contribution to the paper \n\nthat was the prediction of high-pressure density of biodiesel fuels using the \n\nrevised GCVOL group contribution method.  \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n \n\n3.2.1.1. Introduction \n\nDensity is an important property for a fuel because injection systems, pumps and \n\ninjectors must deliver an amount of fuel precisely adjusted to provide proper combustion \n\n[129]. So it influences the amount of mass injected in diesel engines [130] [131]. Density \n\ndata is important in numerous unit operations in biodiesel production and required to be \n\nknown to properly design reactors, distillation units and separation process, storage tanks \n\nand process piping [132, 133]. The magnitude of density depends on the raw materials \n\nused for biodiesel fuel production and on the biodiesel alkyl esters profile [134]. So the \n\ncapacity to correctly predict biodiesel densities from the composition of fatty esters is of \n\nmajor relevance for a correct formulation of an adequate blend of raw materials aiming at \n\nproducing biodiesel according to the required quality standards [135, 136] with the lowest \n\nproduction costs. \n\nThis section used the new experimental density data for ten biodiesel samples \n\nmeasured at temperatures from 278.15 to 373.15 K to assess the adequacy of revised \n\nGCVOL group contribution method for predicting the high-pressure densities of biodiesel \n\nfuels.  \n\n \n\n3.2.1.2. Experimental section \n\n \n\n3.2.1.2.1. Biodiesel sample synthesis \n\nTen biodiesel samples were here studied. Two of these samples were obtained from \n\nPortuguese biodiesel producers, namely Soy A and GP (Soybean+Rapeseed). Eight \n\nbiodiesel samples were synthesized at our laboratory by a transesterification reaction of the \n\nvegetal oils: Soybean (S), Rapeseed (R), and Palm (P), and their respective binary and \n\nternary mixtures: Soybean+Rapeseed (SR), Rapeseed+Palm (RP), Soybean+Palm (SP), \n\nand Soybean+Rapeseed +Palm (SRP) and Sunflower (Sf). The molar ratio of oil: methanol \n\nused was 1:5 with 0.5 % sodium hydroxide by weight of oil as catalyst. The reaction was \n\nperformed at 55 \u00baC during 24 h under methanol reflux. The reaction time chosen was \n\nadopted for convenience and to guarantee a complete reaction conversion. Raw glycerol \n\nwas removed in two steps, the first after 3 h reaction and then after 24 h reaction in a \n\nseparating funnel. Biodiesel was purified by washing with hot distilled water until a neutral \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n \n\npH was achieved. The biodiesel was then dried until the EN ISO 12937 limit for water was \n\nreached (less than 500 ppm of water). The water content was checked by Karl- Fischer \n\ntitration.  \n\n \n\n3.2.1.2.2. Determination of FAME composition \n\nThe composition of the fatty acid esters in these biodiesels was analyzed using a \n\ncapillary gas chromatography flame ionization detector (GC-FID). This equipment is a \n\nVarian CP-3800 with a FID in a split injection system with a Varian GC column CP 9080 \n\nselect biodiesel for fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) column (30 m \u00d7 0.32 mm \u00d7 0.25 ?m). \n\nThe column temperature was set at 120 \u00baC and then programmed to increase up to 250 \u00baC \n\nat 4 \u00baC/min. The detector and injector were set at 250 \u00ba C. The carrier gas was helium with \n\na flow rate of 2 mL/min.  \n\n \n\n3.2.1.2.3. Density measurement \n\nAtmospheric density was measured at our Laboratory in the temperature range of \n\n278.15 to 373.15 K and at atmospheric pressure using an automated SVM 3000 Anton Paar \n\nrotational Stabinger Viscometer. The apparatus was equipped with a vibrating U-tube \n\ndensimeter. The absolute uncertainty of the density is 0.0005 kg/m\n3\n. The SVM 3000 uses \n\nPeltier elements for fast and efficient thermostability. The temperature uncertainty is \u00b1 \n\n0.02 K from 288.15 to 378.15 K. The SVM was previously tested for other compounds and \n\npresented a very good reproducibility [135, 137]. The instrument was rinsed with ethanol \n\nthree times and then pumped in a closed circuit at constant flow of the solvent during \n\ntwenty minutes at 323 K. This cleaning cycle was repeated with acetone and then kept at \n\n343 K for thirty minutes under a stream of air to ensure that the measurement cell was \n\nthoroughly cleaned and dried before the measurement of a new sample.  \n\nThe experimental procedure of high-pressure density measurement is already \n\ndescribed elsewhere [138-140]. An Anton Paar 512P vibrating tube densimeter, connected \n\nto an Anton Paar DMA 4500 data acquisition unit was used for this purpose. Temperature \n\nstability was ensured with a PolyScience 9510 circulating fluid bath, and the temperature \n\nvalue was determined with a CKT100 platinum probe placed in the immediacy of the \n\ndensity measuring cell, with an uncertainty that has been determined to be lower than \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n \n\n5\u00d710\n-2\n\n K. The pressure was generated and controlled using a Ruska 7610 pressure \n\ncontroller, whose pressure stability is 2 \u00d710\n-3 \n\nMPa. This device determines the vibration \n\nperiod of a metallic U-shape cell filled with the studied fluid, which is directly linked to \n\nthe sample fluid density. The repeatability in the density values determined from the \n\nvibration period measured by the DMA 4500 unit is 10\n-5\n\n g/cm\n3\n. The combinations of \n\ndensity determination repeatability and the accuracies in temperature and pressure \n\nmeasurement lead to an overall experimental density uncertainty value that is lower than \n\n10\n-4\n\n g/cm\n3\n. \n\n \n\n3.2.1.3. GCVOL group contribution method \n\nGCVOL method is a group contribution method developed for the prediction of \n\nmolar volumes of liquids. This method fractionates the molecule into various functional \n\ngroups and then uses the molar volume of each group to estimate the density of the \n\nmolecule according to the Eq. (3.2.1) where x is the molar fraction, Mw (g/mol) is the \n\nmolecular weight and V (g/cm\n3\n) is the molar volume. \n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\nii\n\ni\n\nii\n\nVx\n\nMwx\n\n?\n\n       (3.2.1) \n\nThe molar volume is estimated using the Eq.

Density of Ethylic Biodiesels \n\n \n\n \n\nTwo sets of ethylic biodiesels were here studied. The first set includes \n\nbiodiesels like EEAI (ethyl esters from Azadinachta indica), EEJC (ethyl esters \n\nfrom Jatropha oil), EEBA (ethyl esters from Balanites aegyptica) and EEWCO \n\n(ethyl esters from waste cooking oil). They were produced by Cosseron et al \n\n[144] at the University of Nancy. The second set includes soybean (S), \n\nsunflower (Sf), binary mixture of soybean with beef tallow (S+B) and palm (P). \n\nThese were produced by Prof. Dr. Meirelles and his group at the University of \n\nCampinas in Brasil.  The measurement of density was done at our Laboratory. \n\nThis section reports the prediction of density for these fuels using the revised \n\nGCVOL group contribution method that already predicted very well the \n\ndensity of methylic biodiesels.  \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n \n\n3.2.2.1. Experimental Section \n\nThe samples of EEAI (ethyl esters from Azadinachta indica), EEJC (ethyl esters \n\nfrom Jatropha oil), EEBA (ethyl esters from Balanites aegyptica) and EEWCO (ethyl \n\nesters from waste cooking oil) were produced in the LGRP Laboratory (Nancy, France) by \n\nCosseron et al [144]. Shortly, they used alkali catalysed-transesterification reaction to \n\nconvert the oils into biodiesels. The reaction was conducted in a 4-L jacked reactor made \n\nof borosilicate glass and equipped with a reflux condenser (operating conditions: 80 \u00b0C, 1 \n\nwt % EtONa by weight of oil, stirring speed 250 rpm, ethanol :oil molar ratio 6:1). After 2 \n\nh of reaction to ensure almost complete conversion of the oil (mass fraction in FAEE of the \n\ncrude biodiesel obtained at this stage: 91.7 wt %, determined by GC-FID), the reactor was \n\ncooled and the two formed layers (a lower phase rich in glycerol and an upper-phase rich \n\nin FAEE) were separated by sedimentation and the latter underwent two stages of \n\npurification to concentrate the sample. The FAEE composition in biodiesel samples was \n\nhere analysed again in gas chromatography following the same procedures described in \n\nprevious section 3.2.1.  \n\nThe samples of soybean (S), sunflower (Sf) and palm (P) were produced by the \n\ntransesterification of the corresponding oils with ethanol using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) \n\nas the catalyst. The amount of NaOH used was 1.0 wt. % of the oil. Oil and ethanol with a \n\nmole ratio of 1:6 reacted at 323.15 K for 180 min. A fourth sample consisting of ethylic \n\nbiodiesel derived from soybean oil and beef tallow (S+B) was supplied by Fertibom \n\n(Catanduva, SP, Brazil), a Brazilian company that produces ethylic biodiesel in industrial \n\nscale. The fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) compositions for all biodiesel samples were \n\ndetermined in triplicate by gas chromatography. The chromatographic analyses were \n\ncarried out using a GC capillary gas chromatograph system (Agilent, 6850 Series GC \n\nSystem, Santa Clara, CA, USA) under the following experimental conditions: Elite 225 \n\ncapillary column (PERKIN ELMER, 50 % Cyanopropylphenyl-Phenylmethylpolysiloxane, \n\n(0.25?m\u00d729m\u00d70.25mm); helium as carrier gas at a flow rate of 2.17 \u00d7 10\n?8\n\n m\n3\n/s; injection \n\ntemperature of 523 K; column temperature of 373 K for 120 s, 373\u2013503 K (rate of \n\n7 K/60 s), 503 K for 600 s; detection temperature of 523 K; and injection volume of \n\n1.0 ?L. The fatty acid ethyl esters were identified by comparison with external standards \n\npurchased from Nu Check Prep (Elysian, MN, USA). Quantification was done by internal \n\nnormalization. \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n \n\nThe measurement of density was done in the temperature range of 288.15 to 368.15 \n\nK and at atmospheric pressure using an automated SVM 3000 Anton Paar rotational \n\nStabinger Viscometer following the same procedure described in Section 3.2.1.  \n\n \n\n3.2.2.2. Results and discussion \n\nThe FAEE compositions of the ethylic biodiesels are presented in Table 3.2.6 \n\nwhere the EEWCO is the most unsaturated biodiesel and P is the less unsaturated one.  \n\nTable 3.2 6.

Conclusions \n\nThe high-pressure densities of ten methylic biodiesel fuels were here predicted with \n\nthe revised GCVOL group contribution method. The prediction was excellent with and \n\noverall average relative deviations (OARD) of 0.37 %. Moreover the deviations over the \n\ntemperature were almost stable with the maximum of 0.40 %. This model was also applied \n\nto predict the atmospheric densities of eight ethylic biodiesels and the prediction was good \n\nwith and OARD of only 0.51 % and the deviations were stable with a maximum of only \n\n0.85 %. So the revised GCVOL method can be applied for all types of biodiesels since the \n\ncompositions of fatty esters are known.  \n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n \n\n3.3.

So this section is an adapted version of the \n\npublished paper.  \n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n \n\n3.3.1.1. Introduction \n\nOne of the major problems associated with biodiesel is that its viscosity may be \n\nhigher than that for diesel fuel. A fuel of high viscosity tends to form larger droplets upon \n\ninjection, leading to poorer atomization during the spray and creating operation problems, \n\nsuch as increased carbon deposits [146] and may enhance the polymerization reaction, \n\nespecially for oils of a high degree of unsaturation [147]. It also leads to poor combustion \n\nand increased exhaust smoke and emissions, beyond the problems in cold weather because \n\nof the increase of viscosity with a decreasing temperature. On the other hand, a fuel with \n\nlow viscosity may not provide sufficient lubrication for the precision fit of fuel injection \n\npumps, resulting in leakage or increased wear [148]. \n\nThus, the kinematic viscosity of biodiesel at 40 \u00b0C must be in the range of 3.5-5.0 \n\nmm\n2\n/s according to EN-14214 specifications in Europe [107] and 1.9-6.0 mm\n\n2\n/s in \n\naccordance with American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) D-6751 \n\nspecifications in the USA [108], while the limit for diesel fuel is 2.0-4.5 mm\n2\n/s [148]. \n\nNevertheless, in similarity to the feed oils, there is only few information about viscosity of \n\nbiodiesel blends and biodiesel-diesel mixtures over the whole composition range at \n\ndifferent operational conditions of pressure and temperature.  \n\nThis work evaluated the predictive capabilities of three models developed by \n\nCeriani et al.[149], Krisnangkura et al.[147] and Yuan et al.[150], respectively, for the \n\nestimation of the viscosity of several biodiesels and their blends with diesel fuels. A \n\nrevised version of Yuan\u2019s model was also proposed and evaluated. \n\n \n\n3.3.1.2. Samples and Viscosity measurement \n\nSeven of ten methylic biodiesel samples already reported in section 3.2.1 and an \n\nadditional compound named B1 (methyl oleate of technical grade, 70 %) supplied by \n\nSigma were here used. \n\nMeasurements of viscosity were performed in the temperature range of 278.15-\n\n363.15 K at atmospheric pressure using an automated SVM 3000 Anton Paar rotational \n\nStabinger viscometer. The temperature uncertainty is 0.02 K from 288.15 to 378.15 K. The \n\nrelative uncertainty of the dynamic viscosity obtained is less than 0.5 % for the standard \n\n\n\n \n\n62 \n \n\nfluid SHL120 (SH Calibration Service GMbH), in the range of the studied temperatures. \n\nThis viscometer was previously tested for other compounds and presented a very good \n\nreproducibility [151-153]. \n\n \n\n3.3.1.3. Viscosity Models \n\nThe models described here are valid for the estimation of the viscosity of mixtures \n\nof fatty acid alkyl esters. The viscosities of biodiesel are calculated using the equation of \n\nGrunberg-Nissan, which is known to be the most suitable equation for computing the \n\nviscosity of liquid mixtures [146, 150]. Given that biodiesel fuels are non-associated \n\nliquids (i.e., they have essentially a dispersive interaction between the individual \n\ncomponents), their dynamic viscosity can be estimated using the following equation: \n\ni\n\ni\n\nim\nx ?? lnln ??       (3.3.1) \n\nWhere ?i is the dynamic viscosity of an individual compound, ?m is the dynamic viscosity \n\nof the mixture, and xi is the mole fraction. \n\n \n\n3.3.1.3.1. Ceriani\u2019s Model \n\nCeriani et al.[149] proposed a model to predict the viscosity of fatty acid esters \n\nbased on a group contribution method, i.e., a compound or a mixture of compounds is \n\nconsidered as a solution of groups, and its properties are the sum of the contributions of \n\neach group [149]. The model for the pure compounds is described in Eqs (3.3.2) - (3.3.4) \n\nQKTDKTC\nKT\n\nB\nANM\n\nKTDKTC\nKT\n\nB\nANsmPa\n\nkk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nki\n\nkk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nkm\n\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n????\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n????\n\n?\n\n?\n\n//ln\n/\n\n//ln\n/\n\n./ln\n\n22\n\n2\n\n2\n\n11\n\n1\n\n1\n?\n\n   (3.3.2) \n\nwith \n\n      (3.3.3) \n\nand \n\n      (3.3.4) \n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n \n\nwhere Nk is the number of groups k in the molecule i, M is the component molecular \n\nweight that multiplies the \u201cperturbation term\u201d, A1k, B1k, C1k, D1k, A2k, B2k, C2k, and D2k are \n\nparameters obtained from the regression of the experimental data, k represents the groups \n\nof component i, Q is a correction term, f0, f1, s0, and s1 are optimized constants, ?, ?, ?, and \n\n? are optimized parameters obtained by regression of the databank as a whole, Nc is the \n\ntotal number of carbon atoms in the molecule, and Ncs is the number of carbons of the \n\nalcohol side chain. The parameter values were found by Ceriani et al [149]. \n\n \n\n3.3.1.3.2. Krisnangkura\u2019s model \n\nKrisnangkura et al [147] fitted Eq. (3.3.5) to an experimental viscosity databank \n\nand provided a set of parameters for the description of the viscosity of pure fatty acid \n\nmethyl esters (FAME) [147]. \n\n       (3.3.5) \n\nThis equation was developed by considering the viscosity as the integral of the interaction \n\nforces of molecules. On the basis of this approach, the temperature dependency of the \n\nviscosity for short-chain methyl esters (C6-C12) can be estimated by Eq. (3.3.6) \n\n     (3.3.6) \n\nwhile for longer chain esters (C12:0?C18:0), the viscosity obeys Eq.(3.3.7). \n\n     (3.3.7) \n\nThe viscosity of unsaturated FAME is estimated by Eqs. (3.3.8)-(3.3.11). \n\n       (3.3.8) \n\n       (3.3.9) \n\n       (3.3.10) \n\n       (3.3.11) \n\n\n\n \n\n64 \n \n\nIn all of these equations, ? is the kinematic viscosity expressed in mm\n2\n/s and T is the \n\nabsolute temperature in kelvin. \n\nBecause Krisnangkura\u2019s model does not provide equations for several unsaturated \n\nFAME, such as C16:1, C20:0, C20:1, and C22:1, to predict the viscosity of biodiesel \n\ncontaining these compounds, it was necessary to resort to a pseudo-component approach, \n\nwhere the biodiesel composition was modified by adding C16:1 to C16:0, C20:0 and C20:1 \n\nto C18:3, and C22:0 to C22:1. \n\nBeyond that, given that Krisnangkura\u2019s model provides only kinematic viscosities, \n\ntheir conversion into dynamic viscosities was performed by considering the density data \n\nfor pure FAME reported by Pratas et al [151, 152]. \n\n \n\n3.3.1.3.3. Yuan\u2019s model \n\nYuan et al [150] applied the Vogel-Tammann?Fulcher (VTF) equation to describe \n\nthe viscosity-temperature relationship of pure FAME commonly present in biodiesel fuels \n\n       (3.3.12) \n\nand then to estimate the viscosity of biodiesel fuels based on their FAME composition \n\nthrough the mixture model. In Eq.(3.3.12), A, B, and T0 are parameters with values \n\ndetermined by fitting experimental viscosity data available and are reported by Yuan et al \n\n[150]. \n\n3.3.1.3.4. Revised Yuan\u2019s model \n\nIn previous works, Pratas et al [151, 152] reported new and more accurate data for \n\nthe viscosities of fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters. Revised Yuan\u2019s model consists of a \n\nversion of Yuan\u2019s model where the parameters of the VTF model were refitted to the new \n\ndata. The new parameters for FAME are presented in Table 3.3.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n65 \n \n\nTable 3.3 1.

Database of biodiesel viscosities \n\nAlthough values for the biodiesel viscosity are common in the literature, \n\ninformation concerning the biodiesel composition that is more detailed than the \n\ninformation about the oil used for the biodiesel synthesis is scarce. To apply the models \n\nstudied here, detailed information about the biodiesel and/or diesel composition is \n\nrequired.  \n\nThe database for biodiesels used in this work was collected from the literature and \n\nsupplemented with data for seven new biodiesels measured in our laboratory whose \n\ncomposition is detailed in Section 3.2. The compositions in terms of FAME of literature \n\ndata are reported in Table 3.3.2. The biodiesels used in this study cover the most important \n\noils used in biodiesel production, such as soy, palm, canola, rapeseed, and sunflower, but \n\nalso other oils, such as cotton seed, coconut, and babassu, are relevant because of their \n\nsingular compositions. In terms of FAME distributions, it addresses both oils rich in short-\n\nchain and saturated fatty acids, such as coconut, rich in saturated fractions, such as palm, \n\nand rich in unsaturated compounds, such as soy and sunflower. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n66 \n \n\nTable 3.3 2.

The results suggest that all of the models tend to underpredict the \n\nexperimental viscosities. The predictions of Ceriani\u2019s and Krisnangkura\u2019s models (Figure \n\n3.3.1) are systematically larger than the Yuan-type models and temperature-dependent. Note, \n\nhowever, this dependency is opposite in the two cases: while Ceriani\u2019s deviations tend to \n\nincrease with the temperature, the reverse effect is observed for Krisnangkura\u2019s model; i.e., \n\nthe deviations are lower at the higher temperatures, where the viscosities have lower values. \n\nIn both cases, the deviations at the temperature extremes tend to be very large (up to 25 %). \n\nThe temperature dependency of Ceriani\u2019s model seems to be related to the poor description of \n\nthe viscosity of unsaturated fatty acid esters as discussed in previous works [151, 152]. A re-\n\nestimation of the parameters for these compounds should allow for a better description of the \n\nexperimental viscosities. The temperature dependency of the fatty acid esters is better \n\ndescribed in large temperature ranges by a VTF equation as suggested by Yuan et al [150] \n\nthan by the Arrhenius type adopted by Krisnangkura. The poor temperature dependency of \n\nthis model is due to the equation used to describe the temperature dependency of the viscosity \n\nof the pure components of the mixture. \n\n\n\n \n\n69 \n \n\nTable 3.3 5.

Viscosity of ethylic biodiesels \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe two sets of ethylic biodiesels already described in Section 3.2 are here \n\nused again to test the ability of the revised Yuan\u2019s model for predicting the \n\nviscosity of ethylic biodiesels.  \n\n\n\n \n\n77 \n \n\n3.3.2.1. Experimental section \n\nThe eight samples of ethylic biodiesels described in section 3.2 are here used again \n\nto study the viscosity. The measurement of viscosity was done in the temperature range of \n\n288.15 to 368.15 K and at atmospheric pressure using an automated SVM 3000 Anton Paar \n\nrotational Stabinger Viscometer following the same procedure described in Section 3.2.  \n\n \n\n3.3.2.2. Results and discussion \n\nSimilarly to the methylic biodiesels, the viscosity parameters of FAEE were used to \n\ndescribe the viscosity of ethylic biodiesels. The VTF parameters for the revised Yuan\u2019s \n\nmodel are presented in Table 3.3.7. Because there were no parameters for several FAEE, \n\nto predict the viscosity of biodiesel containing these compounds, it was necessary to resort \n\nto a pseudo-component approach, where the biodiesel composition was modified by adding \n\nC16:1 to C16:0 and C20:1, C22:0, C22:1 and C24:0 to C20:0. \n\nTable 3.3 7.

Conclusions \n\n \n\nViscosity data for seven well-characterized methylic biodiesel samples in terms of \n\ntheir FAME composition were measured and reported. Along with a database compiled \n\nfrom the literature, they were used to evaluate four models able to predict biodiesel \n\nviscosities based on information of their FAME compositions. It is shown that, although all \n\nof the models studied are able to predict the viscosities of both pure biodiesels and blends \n\nof biodiesel with petrodiesel with less than 10 % deviation in general, the models of \n\nKrisnangkura et al [147] and Ceriani et al [149] present deviations that are temperature-\n\ndependent and that, at the extremes of the temperature range studied, can have deviations \n\nas high as 25 %. The deviations presented by the Yuan-type models are more robust over \n\ntemperature and also lower than those obtained with the two previous models. In \n\nparticular, the revised version of Yuan\u2019s model proposed here on the basis of new and \n\nmore accurate data for the FAME produces predictions with uncertainties that are close to \n\nthe experimental uncertainties of the experimental data and can thus be an interesting tool \n\nto the design of biofuels or biofuel blends with viscosities that comply with legal \n\nspecifications. \n\nThe Revised Yuan\u2019s model was used also to predict the viscosity of eight ethylic \n\nbiodiesels and the results were acceptable with and overall average relative deviations \n\n(OARD) of 7. 5 %. Moreover the deviations tend to be stable at high temperatures.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n81 \n \n\n3.4. Measurement and Prediction of biodiesel volatility \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThis work is also already published as a paper in the journal of Energy &amp; \n\nFuels [159]. This section is again an adapted version of the published paper. \n\nJust to underline that the samples used in this section were those produced by \n\nDr. Maria Jorge. The experimental measurement and also the modeling of \n\nvapor pressure of biodiesels were done by me.   \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n82 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n83 \n \n\n3.4.1. Introduction \n\nVapor pressures (and boiling points) express the volatility, safety, and stability of a \n\nfuel. Higher value of this property favors the evaporative emissions while lower value \n\nleads to delayed ignition, poor atomization, and problematic combustion. Biodiesel fuels \n\nhave lower vapor pressure and, thus, might cause these problems. To be used in diesel \n\nengines, this property must be adjusted by changing the composition of biodiesel to meet \n\nthe standard values. For this purpose, because the experimental measurement is \n\nimpractical, the use of predictive models is recommended. Many works in the literature \n\nhave dealt with the measurement and estimation of vapor pressures for several methyl \n\nesters and biodiesels [160-166], but almost none of them described with detail their \n\ndependency upon the composition of fatty acid alkyl esters. \n\nThis work aims at reporting the experimental data of vapor pressures for 3 pure \n\nmethyl esters and 10 biodiesel fuels and evaluating the predictive ability of Yuan\u2019s, \n\nCeriani\u2019s, and CPA EoS models for their description. \n\n \n\n3.4.2. Experimental Section: samples and measurement procedure \n\nThe three methyl esters here studied were methyl laurate (with 97 % of purity from \n\nFluka), methyl myristate (with 98 % of purity from SAFC) and methyl palmitate (with 97 \n\n% from SAFC). The ten biodiesel fuels addressed in Section 3.2 are here studied again.  \n\nThe measurement of vapor pressures was done using an ebulliometer previously \n\nused by us to study glycerol containing systems [28]. The ebulliometer was composed of a \n\nboiling still with a port for liquid sampling/injection and a condenser. A thermostatic bath \n\nwas used to control the temperature. The pressure was kept constant trough a vacuum line \n\nwith a calibrated Baratron Heated Capacitance Manometer 728AMKS, with an accuracy of \n\n0.50 %. Circa 20 mL of the sample were used for the measurement. This sample was \n\nalways mixed with a magnetic stirrer and heated to its boiling point. The temperature was \n\nmeasured using a calibrated Pt100 temperature sensor with an uncertainty of 0.05 K. The \n\nmeasurement of boiling points was carried from 0.026 to 0.250 bar with an uncertainty of \n\n\u00b1 0.25 \u00baC.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n84 \n \n\n3.4.3. Models of vapor pressure \n\nThe vapor pressures or boiling points of the biodiesel fuels here studied were \n\npredicted by using three different approaches: Yuan\u00b4s, Ceriani\u2019s and CPA\u2019s model. \n\n \n\n3.4.3.1. Yuan\u2019s model \n\nYuan et al [161] fitted the Antoine equation (Eq. (3.4.1)) to the experimental data \n\nof vapor pressures for several pure fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) that compose the \n\nbiodiesel fuels reported in the works of Rose et al [160] and Scott et al [162]. \n\n? ?\nTC\n\nB\nAP i\n\nv\n\n?\n??log\n\n        (3.4.1)\n \n\nWhere P\nv\ni is the vapor pressure of FAME in Pa, T is the boiling temperature in K and A, B \n\nand C are the fitting parameters. To predict the vapor pressures of biodiesel fuels these are \n\nconsidered to behave as an ideal solution and the vapor pressure of the mixture is given as \n\n? ??? i\nv\n\niBD\nv\n\niPxP         (3.4.2) \n\nWhere P\nv\nBD is the vapor pressure of biodiesel fuels in Pa and xi is the molar composition of \n\nFAME. Since there were no fitting parameters for C16:1, the contribution of this \n\ncompound was added to C16:0. The nomenclature for esters here adopted is based on the \n\nfatty acid chain length where Cx:y ester represents the methyl ester of fatty acid with x \n\ncarbons and y unsaturations. \n\n3.4.3.2. Ceriani\u2019s model \n\nCeriani and co-workers have proposed a number of group-contribution models for \n\nestimating the thermophysical properties of fatty compounds. and among these one for the \n\nvapor pressures [164]. The modeling of viscosity with this model is already described in \n\nSection 3.3. The model for predicting vapor pressures is shown in Eq. (3.4.3) and (3.4.4) \n\nQTDTC\nT\n\nB\nANM\n\nTDTC\nT\n\nB\nANiP\n\nkk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nki\n\nk\n\nkk\n\nk\n\nkk\n\nv\n\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n???\n\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n????\n\n?\n\n?\n\n225.1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n115.1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nln\n\nlnln\n\n    (3.4.3) \n\nWith   \n\n\n\n \n\n85 \n \n\n? ? ? ?\n105.110\n\n)ln( sNsTT\nT\n\nfNfQ\ncsc\n\n???\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n????? ??\n\n?\n?\n\n   (3.4.4) \n\nWhere Nk is the number of groups k in the molecule i; M is the component molecular \n\nweight that multiplies the \u201cperturbation term\u201d; A1k, B1k, C1k, D1k, A2k, B2k, C2k, and D2k are \n\nparameters obtained from the regression of the experimental data; k represents the groups \n\nof component i; Q is a correction term, f0, f1, s0 and s1 are optimized constants; ?, ?, ? and ? \n\nare optimized parameters obtained by regression of databank as whole; Nc is the total \n\nnumber of carbon atoms in the molecule and Ncs is the number of carbons of the alcohol \n\nside chain.

CPA EoS \n\nRecently the Cubic-Plus-Association Equation of State (CPA EoS) has been \n\nextended for application in biodiesel production and purification. It was applied to describe \n\nthe liquid-liquid, the vapor-liquid and the solid-liquid equilibria of binary and \n\nmulticomponent systems containing fatty acids, fatty acid esters, water, short alcohols and \n\nglycerol [167].

However, an excellent vapor pressure description, of \n\nrelevance for this work, is assured, as seen in Table 3.4.6.

It is shown that Yuan\u2019s and CPA EoS models provide \n\na good description of the experimental data with only 1.12 and 1.25 K of overall average \n\ntemperature difference (O?Tm) in boiling temperatures and 3.41 and 0.80 % in vapor \n\npressures. In addition, a new set of CPA EoS pure compound parameters for fatty acid \n\nmethyl esters for applications at high temperatures are proposed.  \n\n\n\n \n\n95 \n \n\n3.5. Measurement and prediction of biodiesel surface tensions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThis work is also published as an article in the journal of Energy &amp; Fuels [135]. \n\nSo this section is an adapted version of the published paper. Note that the \n\nbiodiesel samples used here were the same used in earlier sections. The \n\nexperimental measurement and the modeling of surface tension were done by \n\nme. The modeling with the CPA EoS was done by Dr. Mariana Belo.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n96 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n97 \n \n\n3.5.1. Introduction \n\nSurface tension influences fuel atomization, i.e., the first stage of combustion [37]. \n\nA correct atomization permits proper mixing and complete combustion in an injection \n\nengine, reducing emissions and increasing the engine efficiency [174]. Higher surface \n\ntensions make the drop formation difficult, leading to an inefficient fuel atomization [174]. \n\nFurthermore, just like most biodiesel properties, surface tension increases with long fatty \n\nacid hydrocarbon chains and a level of unsaturated bonds [175], i.e., more unsaturated \n\nbiodiesel fuels will present a higher surface tension. Thus, being able to predict this \n\nphysical property for biodiesels for which composition on fatty acid esters is known makes \n\nit possible to optimize biodiesel production and blending processes, with the final aim of \n\nimproving the fuel performance in the engine, particularly during atomization. \n\nThere is, however, a lack of information concerning surface tensions of biodiesels \n\nor fatty acid esters from which biodiesels are composed, and when available, the data are \n\nlimited to a single temperature [175, 176]. To overcome that lack of data, this work \n\nprovides experimental surface tension data for ten different biodiesel fuels. The \n\nexperimental data were acquired at temperatures from 303.15 to 353.15 K. The data were \n\nused to test two surface tension predictive models: the parachor-based MacLeod-Sugden \n\nequation and the density gradient theory based on the CPA EoS. \n\n3.5.2. Experimental Section \n\nTen biodiesel fuels reported in Section 3.2 were here used again to study the surface \n\ntensions. The detailed compositions of these biodiesels are already reported in Table 3.2.1 \n\n[128]. \n\nThe measurement of the surface tension of the biodiesel samples was carried out \n\nusing a Nima Dynamic Surface Tensiometer, model DST9005, previously used for studies \n\nof hydrocarbon mixtures [177-179] and ionic liquids [180-182]. This is a sophisticated \n\ncomputer controlled instrument that measures and records the forces that biodiesel exerts \n\nto withstand the external force provoked by the immersion of the Pt/Ir Du No\u00fcy ring in the \n\nliquid. A Haake F6 bath circulator, equipped with a Pt100 probe, was connected to the \n\ntensiometer to guarantee that measurements occurred within an uncertainty of \u00b1 0.01 K. \n\nThe ring was always cleaned before each measurement in a butane flame. The \n\n\n\n \n\n98 \n \n\nmeasurement was carried from 303.15 to 353.15 K for all biodiesel fuels. For each sample \n\nat least five sets of three immersion/detachment cycles were measured, providing a \n\nminimum of at least 15 surface tension values, allowing the determination of an average \n\nsurface tension value for each temperature. To correct the meniscus formed by the No\u00fcy \n\nring, the liquid densities of the biodiesels reported in a previous work [128] were \n\nintroduced before measuring the surface tension. \n\n3.5.3. Prediction of biodiesel surface tensions \n\nThe surface tensions of the biodiesel fuels studied here were predicted using two \n\ndifferent predictive approaches: the parachor-based MacLeod-Sugden equation with the \n\nparachors proposed by Allen et al [176] and Knotts et al [183] and the density gradient \n\ntheory (GT) based on the CPA EoS [184-186] as shown in Table 3.5.1. \n\nTable 3.5. 1.

For these purposes, the Cubic-Plus-Association equation of state (CPA EoS) will be \n\nused in this work. \n\nThe CPA EoS was chosen since it presents several advantages over conventional \n\ncubic equations and other association models. The CPA EoS allows an accurate description \n\nof saturated liquid densities without any need for a volume correction, in contrast to what \n\n\n\n \n\n100 \n \n\nsucceeds with traditional cubic EoS, and is also mathematically simpler than other \n\nassociation equations of state such as SAFT. Considering biodiesel industry related \n\nsystems, of interest for this work, it was previously shown that the CPA EoS is the most \n\nadequate model to describe the phase equilibria of different systems appearing during the \n\nbiodiesel production, purification and use, that are characterized by containing polar \n\ncompounds with strong associative interactions, taking into account its accuracy, range of \n\napplicability, simplicity, and predictive character [28, 184, 189-192]. \n\nIn the current work, the CPA EoS model combines a cubic contribution from the \n\nSoave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) EoS with an association contribution, originally proposed by \n\nWertheim [168-170]. Using a generalized cubic term (for the SRK approach with ?1 and ?2 \n\nequal to 0), the cubic and association contributions to the Helmholtz energy (A) are given \n\nby Eqs 3.5.6 and 3.5.7 [193]. \n\n? ?\n? ??\n\n??\n\n??\n\n??\nbnRT\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nan\nA\n\ncubic\n???\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n? 1ln\n\n1\n\n1\nln\n\n2\n\n1\n\n12\n\n    (3.5.6) \n\n? ?? ? ?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n???\n\ni A\n\ni\nii\n\nassoc\n\ni\n\nXA\nXAnRTA\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\nln\n\n.\n\n     (3.5.7)\n\n \n\nWhere i is a component index, b is the co-volume parameter, a the energy parameter, ? is \n\nthe molar density, ni is the number of moles of molecules of component i, n is the total \n\nnumber of moles and XAi is the mole fraction of component i not bonded at site A. \n\nThe pure component energy parameter of CPA has a Soave-type reduced \n\ntemperature dependency: \n\n? ?? ? 2\n10\n\n11\nr\n\nTca)T(a ???\n       (3.5.8) \n\nEsters are non-self-associating compounds, and therefore, there are only three pure \n\ncompound parameters, the parameters of the physical part (a0, c1, and b), to be regressed \n\nsimultaneously from vapor pressure and liquid density data.

It is shown that our data are circa 6 % higher \n\nthan Allen\u2019s data for this temperature. Although the comparison of only one point is not \n\nvery conclusive, this error is acceptable given the differences in composition between the \n\nbiodiesel fuels.  \n\nUsing the parachors suggested by Allen et al [176], the predictions of surface \n\ntensions by the MacLeod-Sugden equation overestimate the experimental data within a 10 \n\n% deviation (OARD of 7.7 %) as shown in Figures 3.5.1 and 3.5.2. This approach \n\nprovides better predictions of surface tension when the parachors suggested by Knotts et al \n\n[183] are used as seen in Figures 3.5.3 and 3.5.4. An OARD of 1.3 % is obtained with this \n\nmodel that is not much higher than the experimental uncertainty of the data. A very good \n\n\n\n \n\n102 \n \n\ndescription of the temperature dependency of the experimental data is achieved using this \n\napproach, as the RDs obtained for the two version of this model, shown in Figures 3.5.2 \n\nand 3.5.4, are almost temperature-independent. The average relative deviations (ARD) for \n\nthe ten biodiesels studied are presented in Table 3.5.3. The reported results show the good \n\npredictive capacity of parachors through the MacLeod-Sugden equation to compute surface \n\ntensions of biodiesel fuels, in particular when the Knotts et al [183] parachors are used \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5 1.

Conclusions \n\nSurface tensions of ten biodiesel fuels were measured at temperatures from 303.15 \n\nto 353.15 K and at atmospheric pressure. \n\nTwo different modeling approaches were used to predict the experimental data: the \n\nMacLeod-Sugden equation with two different parachor sets and the density gradient theory \n\ncoupled with the CPA EoS. The first method presented an OARD of 7.7 % when using the \n\nAllen\u2019s parachors and of 1.3 % with Knotts\u2019 parachors, showing that a simple and \n\nempirical method, based on parachors, can be applied to predict, from the composition, the \n\ntemperature dependence of the biodiesel surface tensions. \n\nUsing constant parameters for the linear temperature dependence of the influence \n\nparameter for all the fatty acid esters constituting the different biodiesels, the gradient \n\n\n\n \n\n108 \n \n\ntheory in combination with the CPA EoS was shown to predict biodiesels surface tensions \n\nwith an OARD of 9.7 %, while also providing information concerning the phase equilibria \n\nof the biodiesel systems. \n\nThese results clearly show that, provided that the biodiesel FAME composition is \n\nknown, the predictive methods here investigated here can be used to predict surface \n\ntensions of biodiesel fuels in a wide range of temperatures. \n\n\n\n \n\n109 \n \n\n3.6. Measurement and Prediction of Speed of Sound \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAs there was no equipment for measuring speeds of sound at the University of \n\nAveiro, the samples here studied were analysed by our collaborators in other \n\nuniversities. The atmospheric speeds of sound of methyl esters and methylic \n\nbiodiesels were measured in Brasil by Prof. Dr. M\u00e1rcio L.L. Paredes and his \n\ngroup at the UERJ. The atmospheric speeds of sound of ethyl esters and ethylic \n\nbiodiesels were measured at the University of Lisboa by Dr. \u00c2ngela Santos and \n\nher group. The methylic biodiesels were produced by Dr. Maria Jorge while the \n\nethylic biodiesels were produced by Prof. Dr. Meirelles and his group at the \n\nUniversity of Campinas in Brasil. This section is an adapted version of the three \n\narticles published in the journals of Energy &amp; Fuels and Fuel [196-198].  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n110 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n111 \n \n\n3.6.1. Introduction \n\nIsentropic bulk modulus and speed of sound are the two properties with important \n\nimpacts on the injection process of a fuel. While the first measures the compressibility of \n\nthe fuel under pressure, i.e., it affects the amount of pressure rise that will occur from the \n\nfuel pump pulse, the second affects the time required for the pressure rise to proceed \n\nthrough the fuel line and reach the injector. In comparison to petroleum fuel, biodiesel has \n\nhigher values of both properties. A higher isentropic bulk modulus and higher speed of \n\nsound would cause an earlier injection of fuel and also an earlier combustion, which raises \n\npeak in-cylinder temperature, thereby increasing thermal NOx formation [199] namely for \n\ninjectors activated with pressure [176, 200, 201]. Thus the bulk modulus and speed of \n\nsound values are relevant for system modeling and experimental injection rate \n\ndetermination [202]. They are important for the study of the injection rate, injection timing, \n\ninjection duration, injection pressure, start of combustion, in-cylinder gas pressure and \n\ntemperature and heat release rate that influence the final NOx emissions [203]. \n\nIn case of speed of sound, just like any other thermophysical properties, its \n\nmagnitude is influenced by the structure of the fatty acid alkyl esters that compose \n\nbiodiesel fuels such as chain length, branching and level of unsaturation [204]. Thus the \n\nknowledge of the relationship between the biodiesel properties and the percentage of fatty \n\nesters in biodiesels is of great importance. \n\n Unfortunately there are not so many data available in the literature for fatty acid \n\nmethyl esters (FAME) [196, 201, 205-210], being the experimental speeds of sound of \n\nfatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) even more scant [211], although some studies were already \n\ndone for the shorter methyl and ethyl esters [212]. The oldest experimental data of the \n\nspeed of sound include those reported by Gouw et al [206] at 20 and 40 \u00b0C for methyl \n\nesters and by Tat et al [208] for biodiesel fuels at pressures from atmospheric to 35 MPa. \n\nLater, these authors also proposed correlations to estimate the speeds of sound of alkyl \n\nmonoesters at higher temperatures and pressures[201]. Ott et al [210] provided the speeds \n\nof sound for five methyl esters as a function of the temperature at 83 kPa. Recently, some \n\nexperimental data were reported by Huber et al [213] for two commercial biodiesels and \n\nby Kumar et al [214] for Jatropha curcas biodiesel at atmospheric pressure. Daridon et al \n\n[211] provided experimental data for several pure fatty acid esters at atmospheric pressure \n\nand temperatures from 283.15 to 373.15 K and published [215] high-pressure speeds of \n\n\n\n \n\n112 \n \n\nsound for methyl caprate and ethyl caprate. This work provides new experimental data of \n\nspeed of sound for several fatty esters and biodiesel fuels measured at different \n\ntemperature and pressure and then using them to evaluate the predictive ability of several \n\nmethods.  \n\n \n\n3.6.2. Experimental Details: samples and measurement procedures \n\n \n\n3.6.2.1. Speed of Sound of FAME and methylic biodiesels \n\nThe eight methyl esters here studied were methyl laurate (with 97 % of purity from \n\nFluka), methyl myristate (with 98 % of purity from SAFC) and Methyl Oleate (with 99 % \n\nfrom Aldrich), methyl caprylate, (with 99 % purity from Sigma-Aldrich); methyl caprate, \n\n(with 99 % purity from Fluka); methyl palmitate, (with 99 % purity from Sigma-Aldrich); \n\nmethyl stearate, (with 99 % purity from Fluka) and methyl linoleate, (with 99 % purity \n\nfrom Sigma-Aldrich). The ten methylic biodiesel fuels reported by Pratas et al [128] and \n\naddressed in Section 3.2 are here used again to study the speed of sound.  \n\nThe density and speed of sound were obtained using an automatic digital \n\ndensimeter (Anton Paar DSA 5000). DSA 5000 simultaneously determines two physically \n\nindependent properties within one sample. The instrument is equipped with a density cell \n\nand a sound velocity cell combining the known oscillating U-tube method with a highly \n\naccurate measurement of the speed of sound [216]. The density and speed of sound meter \n\nwas calibrated against ultrapure water and air at atmospheric pressure. The calibration was \n\naccepted if the measurements were estimated to be within \u00b1 2 \u00d7 10\n-3\n\n kg/m\n3\n and \u00b1 0.02 m/s \n\nof the reference values, respectively. The measurements were obtained in duplicates, and \n\nthe standard experimental uncertainty was obtained by dividing the modulus of the \n\nrepeatability differences by the square of two. The value obtained was 0.23 m/s for 142 \n\nrepetition points [216]. The estimated standard uncertainties in density and speed of sound \n\nmeasurements are 2 \u00d7 10\n\u20132\n\n kg/m\n3\n and 0.1 m/s\n\n1\n, respectively. The standard uncertainty in \n\nthe temperature is 0.01 K. \n\n\n\n \n\n113 \n \n\n3.6.2.2. Speed of Sound of FAEE and ethylic biodiesels \n\nThe nine ethyl esters here studied were ethyl butyrate (98% quoted purity from \n\nFluka), ethyl caprylate (>99 % quoted purity from Aldrich), ethyl caprate (99 % quoted \n\npurity from Fluka), ethyl laurate (99 % quoted purity from Sigma), ethyl myristate (99 % \n\nquoted purity from Aldrich), ethyl palmitate (>99 % quoted purity from Sigma), ethyl \n\nstearate (>99% quoted purity from Fluka), ethyl oleate (>98 % quoted purity from \n\nAldrich), ethyl linoleate (>99 % quoted purity from Sigma). These compounds were used \n\nas received without any further purification. The four biodiesel fuels here used (S, Sf, S+B \n\nand P) are already described in Section 3.2.  \n\nExperimental measurements of density and speed of sound were made concurrently \n\nusing an Anton Paar vibrating tube densimeter and ultrasound speed meter, model DSA \n\n5000 M, with an automatic temperature control within \u00b10.01 K. All measurements were \n\nmade at ambient pressure. According to the procedure already described elsewhere [217], \n\ncalibration of the speed of sound cell was made with degassed Millipore ultra-quality \n\nwater. Measurement and comparison with literature values of speed of sound of toluene \n\nand cyclohexane at 25 \u00b0C leads us to assume an accuracy of 0.5 m/s, as claimed by the \n\nmanufacturer. In the case of density, besides the usual method recommended by the \n\nmanufacturer of using dry air and degassed ultra-pure water at 293.15 K as reference \n\nfluids, a new calibration procedure thoroughly described elsewhere [218] was performed. \n\nThe calibrants used were ultra-pure water and dodecane with certified density values \n\nissued by H\u00a7D Fitzgerald, with expanded uncertainties of 0.01 kg/m\n3\n (coverage factor \n\nk = 2, providing a 95 % level of confidence). The use of this pair of calibrating fluids \n\nallowed a close bracketing of the densities measured, the importance of which has recently \n\nbeen emphasized by Fortin et al [219] As the temperature range of certified density values \n\nfor dodecane does not cover values higher than 323.15 K, an extrapolation of those values \n\nhad to be made. However, a careful analysis of results based on comparison between direct \n\ndensity values (taken from direct readings of the densimeter) and final values obtained \n\nfrom the calibration procedure allowed a reassurance about the validity of that \n\nextrapolation. \n\nEvery day before starting the measurements, the usual routine procedure of \n\nperforming a water and air check was invariably adopted. Before injection all samples \n\n\n\n \n\n114 \n \n\nwere pre-heated, and degassed, at the maximum experimental temperature. Then, for the \n\nsame single sample injection a complete series of measurements was made, decreasing the \n\ntemperature from 343.15 K to 293.15 K in decrements of 5 K. At each temperature three to \n\nseven data readings were taken and some measurements were repeated with a new \n\ninjection, allowing asserting an estimate for the repeatability and standard uncertainty for \n\ndensity values lower than 0.0006 % and 0.005 %, respectively, and for speed of sound of \n\n0.01 % and 0.02 %, respectively. After each set of measurements the instrument was \n\nflushed several times with n-heptane at 333 K and with acetone at 313 K, sequentially, and \n\nthen dried at 343 K during at least 1 h, with a stream of forced room air. To assess the \n\neffectiveness of these cleaning actions, new air and water checks were done and whenever \n\ndeviations higher than 0.002 % for density and 0.013 % for sound speed were found, a new \n\ncycle of cleaning steps was executed. \n\n \n\n3.6.3. Models for speed of sound \n\nThe description of speed of sound for fatty esters (FAME and FAEE) and biodiesel \n\nfuels was done by using the Auerbach\u2019s relation, linear mixing rule and the Wada\u2019s group \n\ncontribution method as individually described bellow.  \n\n \n\n3.6.3.1. Auerbach\u2019s model \n\nThe Auerbach\u2019s model [143, 220] is represented by Eq. (3.6.1), where u is the \n\nspeed of sound in m/s, ?  is the surface tension in N/m and ? is the density in kg/m\n3\n. Since \n\nthis equation requires the prior knowledge of densities and surface tensions, this work uses \n\nthe data reported in our previous works [128, 135]. \n\n3\n\n2\n\n10\n.1033.6\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\nu         (3.6.1) \n\nThis work also considered a modified version of Auerbach\u2019s model, in order to \n\nachieve a better description of the experimental speed of sound data for biodiesel fuels, by \n\nrelaxing the value of the constant c1 of Eq. (3.6.2).  \n\n\n\n \n\n115 \n \n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n? ?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n1.\n3\n\n2\n\n10\n.1033.6\n\nc\n\nu\n?\n\n?\n\n \n\n      (3.6.2) \n\n \n\n3.6.3.2. Ideal Mixture Mixing Rules  \n\n \n\nAs biodiesel fuels are a mixture of FAME (or FAEE) of similar molecular weight, \n\ntheir speeds of sound can be estimated using a mixing rule assuming an ideal mixture \n\nbehavior. This approach, described by Eq. (3.6.3), will be here used to describe the speed \n\nof sound of biodiesels, where uBD is the speed of sound of biodiesel in m/s, xi is the molar \n\ncomposition and ui is the speed of sound of individual fatty esters in m/s.  \n\n?? i iiBD uxu          (3.6.3) \n\nTo calculate the speed of sound of methylic and ethylic biodiesels some approaches \n\nhave to be done especially when there are no data for some esters. So for methylic \n\nbiodiesels, due to lack of experimental data of speed of sound for some minoritary FAME \n\ncompounds, such as C10:0, C16:1, C20:0, C20:1, C22:0, C22:1 and C24:0, the pseudo-\n\ncomponent concept was adopted by adding C10:0 to C12:0, C16:1 to C16:0 and C20:0, \n\nC22:0 and C24:0 to C18:0 and C20:1 and C22:1 to C18:3. In this work the experimental \n\nspeed of sound for the methyl esters used, with their respective purities, was that reported \n\nby Tat et al [201] except for C14:0 measured in this work. This methyl ester has 98 % of \n\npurity.  \n\nThe same procedure is valid for the ethylic biodiesels, i.e., since there are no \n\nexperimental data of speed of sound for some of the less common FAEE, to use the mixing \n\nrules, a pseudo-component approach is used by adding C16:1 to C16:0 and C20:1, C22:0 \n\nand C24:0 to C20:0. The nomenclature for esters here adopted is based on the fatty acid \n\nchain length.  \n\n \n\n3.6.3.3. Wada\u2019s Group Contribution Method \n\nThe Wada\u2019s Group Contribution Method was previously proposed by Daridon et al \n\n[211] to predict the speed of sound of alkyl esters. This model simply relates speed of \n\n\n\n \n\n116 \n \n\nsound (u in m/s) with density (? in kg/m\n3\n), molecular mass (Mw in g/mol) and molecular \n\ncompressibility (?m) according to the following equation: \n\n2/7\n\n3\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\nMw\nu m\n\n?\n?\n\n         (3.6.4) \n\nThe molecular compressibility (?m) is also known as Wada\u2019s constant and its value can \n\neasily be decomposed in groups [211] allowing for the establishment of a group \n\ncontribution model as presented in the following equation: \n\n))(1()(\n0,\n\n1\n\nTTKNTK\njm\n\nn\n\nj\n\njm\n\nG\n\n????\n?\n\n?\n\n        (3.6.5) \n\nWhere Km,j connotes the Wada\u2019s constant of the group j which occurs Nj times in the given \n\nmolecule and ? is a constant parameter used to take into account the influence of \n\ntemperature. \n\nTo carry out the predictions of speed of sound using the Wada\u2019s model, the ester \n\nmolecule must be split into five main groups: -CH3- and -CH2- to account the linear and \n\nsaturated alkyl chain, -CH CH- to describe the contribution of the unsaturation of the \n\nalkyl chain and -CH3COO- and -CH2COO- to take into account the ester contribution from \n\nmethyl and ethyl esters, respectively. Then the corresponding Wada\u2019s constants reported in \n\nDaridon et al [211], are used to estimate the speed of sound for each ethyl ester in the \n\nrange of temperatures investigated. \n\nFor biodiesels, the application of Wada\u2019s model can be carried using two different \n\napproaches. The first approach (Wada 1) follows exactly the method described above, i.e., \n\nsplits the biodiesel molecules into the main groups aforementioned, whose Wada\u2019s \n\nconstants are already known, then predicts their speeds of sound using either the \n\nexperimental or predicted densities of biodiesels using a linear mixing rule of the densities \n\nof the pure fatty acid esters as the two approaches present only ca. 0.1 % of difference. The \n\nsecond approach (Wada 2) consists of using a linear mixing rule to predict the speed of \n\nsound of biodiesels from that of their pure constituents (fatty esters) according to Eq. \n\n(3.6.1), but with the speed of sound of pure esters (ui) predicted with the Wada\u2019s model. \n\n\n\n \n\n117 \n \n\nFor this approach the estimation of the densities for pure FAEE were the same as those \n\nused in Wada 1. \n\n \n\n3.6.4. Results and discussion \n\n \n\n3.6.4.1. Speed of sound of FAME and methylic biodiesels \n\nThe experimental data of speed of sound for eight pure methyl esters and ten \n\nbiodiesels here studied are reported in Tables 3.6.1 to 3.6.2. The experimental data of \n\nspeed of sound for the methyl esters here measured were compared to those reported in the \n\nliterature [201, 206, 210, 211]. The results show a good agreement between the \n\nexperimental and literature data, presenting only deviations within \u00b1 1 % of literature data \n\nas seen in Figures 3.6.1 and 3.6.2, except for methyl palmitate reported by Tat et al [201] \n\nwith a sample of questionable purity. At the same conditions, the speed of sound for \n\nmethyl linoleate is thus higher than that of methyl palmitate and methyl stearate, as seen in \n\nTable 3.6.1. These results in biodiesels with a high level of saturated short-chain \n\ncompounds, such as those based on palm [196] or coconut oil, present lower speeds of \n\nsound than those containing high levels of unsaturated compounds, such as biodiesel based \n\non sunflower oil [196]. \n\nFor biodiesel fuels, very small differences in the speed of sound are observed \n\nbetween the various biodiesels studied. Both the magnitude of the speed of sound and its \n\ntemperature dependency vary less than 1% between the fluids, unlike what was previously \n\nobserved for other properties [129, 135, 216]. In spite of the similarities it can be observed, \n\nnevertheless, that the increase in concentration of the saturation level of the compounds \n\ndecreases the speed of sound. The palm biodiesel and the mixtures containing palm present \n\nthe lower speeds of sound, while the sunflower has the largest speed of sound measured in \n\nthis work. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n118 \n \n\nTable 3.6. 1.

[201, 206, 210, 211] \n\n \n\nThe experimental speeds of sound of biodiesels were firstly predicted with the \n\nAuerbach\u2019s equation and the Ideal Mixture Mixing Rules. The results reported in Table 3.6.4, \n\nhowever, show that the original Auerbach\u2019s equation fails to provide a good description of the \n\nexperimental data. Aiming at enhancing the description of the data the value of the model \n\nparameter was modified. To develop the modified Auerbach\u2019s relation, four methyl esters \n\n(methyl palmitate, methyl oleate, methyl stearate and methyl linoleate) reported by Ott et al \n\n[210] and three biodiesels (S, SR and SRP) were used as training set to adjust the value of c1, \n\nwhile the other methyl esters and biodiesels here measured were used as validation set.

The behavior of predictions of \n\nspeed of sound for biodiesel fuels are shown in Figure 3.6.5. It is possible to observe again \n\nthat the ideal mixture mixing rules is the most appropriate model for describing the \n\nexperimental data, allowing a good prediction of their temperature dependency.  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.6 5. Predictive ability of the three models evaluated in describing the experimental data of \nspeed of sound for the biodiesel fuels here studied:  Auerbach original, Modified Auerbach and \n\nIdeal mixture mixing rules \n\nTo estimate the speed of sounds for methylic biodiesel fuels at high pressures, this \n\nwork used the experimental data of speed of sound reported by Tat et al [201] to develop a \n\ncorrelation. The experimental data displays very similar pressures dependencies for the speeds \n\nof sound observed for the pure FAME\u2019s and for the biodiesel fuels, that are linear in the range \n\nof pressures (0-35 MPa) studied by Tat et al [201] For the same pressure range, a linear \n\nbehavior is also observed for the experimental data reported by Pairy et al [202]. It should thus \n\nbe possible to describe the pressure dependency of the speed of sound up to 40 MPa by  \n\n         (3.6.6) \n\nWhere u is the speed of sound in m/s, u0 is the speed of sound at atmospheric pressure, a is the \n\npressure gradient and P is the pressure in MPa.

After fitting the Eq. (3.6.6) to the experimental data of the training set, \n\nthe numerical value of the pressure gradient was obtained (a=4.53 m/(s MPa)). This \n\ncorrelation of speed of sound provided an OARD of 0.37 % for the training set and 0.56 % for \n\nthe validation set as detailed in Table 3.6.5. The validity of these correlations is limited to the \n\npressures below 40 MPa and should not be extrapolated to higher pressures. As shown by \n\nPairy et al [202] for higher pressures the pressure dependency of the speed of sound is no \n\nlonger linear. Unfortunately at present the data available precludes the development of a \n\ncorrelation for higher pressures.  \n\nTable 3.6. 5.

Their speeds of sound decrease with the temperature and \n\nincrease with the ester chain length as seen in Figures 3.6.10 and 3.6.11. Moreover, for the \n\nsame chain length, the presence of unsaturated bonds in the ester molecule increases the \n\nmagnitude of speed of sound as expected since this property also depends directly on the \n\ndensity. Due to the lack of experimental data for ethyl esters, our experimental data were only \n\ncompared to those reported by Daridon et al [211] and Ndiaye et al [215, 221].

The same observation is valid for its temperature dependency. \n\nThe experimental data here reported were used to test the predictive ability of the \n\nWada\u2019s model previously proposed [211]. The results reported in Table 3.6.12 suggest that \n\nthe Wada\u2019s model provide a very good description of the experimental speeds of sound for \n\nboth the ethyl esters and the ethylic biodiesels respectively. For the nine ethyl esters studied \n\nthe model tends to slightly overpredict the experimental speed of sound. Moreover, the \n\ndeviations are very stable in the range of temperatures studied, except for the short-chain \n\nesters like ethyl butyrate where the model presents larger deviations as seen in Figure 3.6.13. \n\nThis limitation might be related with the inadequacy of the Wada\u2019s constants here used for \n\ndescription of speed of sound of the short-chain esters. Further work to overcome this problem \n\nis being undertaken but it does not impact on the systems of interest for the biodiesel industry. \n\nBy excluding the ethyl butyrate of the remaining ethyl esters due to the larger deviations, the \n\nWada\u2019s model presents only an OARD of 0.14 %. For the biodiesels, the Wada 1 approach \n\npresents an OARD of 0.59 % (Table 3.6.12). Using the Wada 2 approach the OARD obtained \n\nwas of only 0.45 %. The predictions presented in Figure 3.6.14 show that the deviations are \n\ntemperature independent. Therefore, the Wada\u2019s model applied directly or through the mixing \n\nrules can be extended to other biodiesel fuels provided that the composition of fatty esters is \n\nwell known. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n134 \n \n\nTable 3.6. 12.

Conclusions \n\nThe experimental speeds of sound for eight pure methyl esters and ten methylic \n\nbiodiesel fuels were measured at temperatures from 288 to 343 K and at atmospheric pressure. \n\nThese data were then used, along with other literature data, to evaluate the capacity of two \n\nversions of Auerbach\u2019s relation, ideal mixture mixing rules and Wada\u2019s model to predict the \n\nspeed of sound of biodiesel fuels from the knowledge of their composition. For all biodiesel \n\nstudied, the overall average relative deviation (OARD) value obtained for these models were \n\n1.6, 0.37 and 0.29 %, respectively for the modified Auerbach model, ideal mixture mixing \n\nrules and Wada\u2019s model, respectively.  \n\n1200\n\n1250\n\n1300\n\n1350\n\n1400\n\n1450\n\n1200 1250 1300 1350 1400 1450\n\nu\nc\na\n\nlc\n[m\n\ns\n-1\n\n]\n\nuexp [ms-1]\n\n\n\n \n\n136 \n \n\nCorrelations for estimating the speeds of sound for biodiesels at high pressures were \n\nalso developed with validity up to 40 MPa. The first correlation based on the literature data \n\nprovides an OARD of 0.56 % for seven biodiesels tested. The second correlation that uses the \n\nWada\u2019s model was applied presents a global deviation of 1.0 %.  \n\nThe experimental speeds of sound for nine FAEE and four ethylic biodiesels, measured \n\nat atmospheric pressure and temperature from 293.15 to 343.15 K, were also here reported and \n\nwere used to assess the predictive ability of the Wada\u2019s model. It is shown that this method \n\ndescribes very well the experimental data of speed of sound for pure esters and biodiesel fuels, \n\npresenting only OARDs of 0.25 % and 0.45 %, respectively.  \n\nThis means that when the measurement of speed of sound is impractical for any \n\nbiodiesel, these models can be a useful tool for predicting the speed of sound in a wide range \n\nof temperatures and pressures provided that the composition of fatty esters is known. \n\n\n\n \n\n137 \n \n\n3.7. High pressure density and Speed of Sound of two biodiesel fuels: \n\nmeasurement and prediction \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn previous section (section 3.6) the study of high-pressure speed of sound was \n\ndone only up to 45 MPa due to lack of experimental data at pressures above this \n\nvalue. Up to this limit the trend was linear but above this limit this trend was no \n\nlonger valid anymore as shown by the data of Ndiaye et al [215]. Thereat \n\nHabrioux et al [222] provided experimental data of speed of sound and density \n\nfor biodiesel fuels at pressures up to 200 and 100 MPa respectively for two \n\nbiodiesel fuels (Soybean and Rapeseed) presented here in Supporting \n\ninformation B. This data is already submitted as article to the Journal of Energy \n\n&amp; Fuels. My contribution to this paper was to develop correlations capable of \n\ndescribing the speed of sound and density of biodiesel fuels at pressures above 40 \n\nMPa.  \n\n\n\n \n\n138 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n139 \n \n\n3.7.1. Experimental measurement \n\nThe measurements of speed of sound at high pressure was based on a pulse echo \n\ntechnique working at 3 MHZ with a path length fixed to L0 = 30 mm. This length constitutes an \n\nacceptable compromise between shorter distances that reduce measuring accuracy and longer \n\nthat increase the damping of the wave. The frequency of 3 MHz is low enough to avoid \n\ndispersion phenomena and is also a good compromise between lower frequencies (that give \n\nclear signal but with a lower precision) and higher frequencies (that give more damping of \n\nwave into the fluid but with a better precision). The apparatus is essentially made up of an \n\nacoustic sensor composed of two piezoelectric disks (12 mm in diameter) facing each other at \n\nboth ends of a stainless steel cylindrical support. One of them generates the ultrasonic wave \n\nthat travels into the fluid sample while the other is used to receive different echoes. The entire \n\nacoustic sensor is located within a stainless-steel high-pressure vessel closed at one end by a \n\nplug in which three electric connections were machined. These electric connections allow \n\nconnecting both piezoelectric elements to a high voltage Ultrasonic Pulser \u2013 Receiver device \n\n(high-voltage pulse generator (Panametrics Model 5055PR). The speed of sound is determined \n\nfrom the measurement of the time between two successive echoes by using the base time of an \n\noscilloscope (TEKTRONIX TDS 1022B). The path length needed for calculating speed of \n\nsound was determined at different temperatures and pressures by measuring the time of flight \n\nof the wave into a liquid of known speed of sound. Water and heptane were used for this \n\ncalibration. This calibration leads to an uncertainty in the speed of sound of about 0.06 %. \n\nHowever, the ultimate error in speed of sound measurement depends in addition on the \n\nthermal stability as well as on the uncertainty in the measurement of both temperature and \n\npressure. In order to ensure a satisfactory thermal stability, the full cell is immersed in a \n\nthermostated bath (HUBER CC410) filled with silicone oil and the temperature is directly \n\nmeasured into the fluid by a platinum probe (Pt100, 1.2 mm diameter) housed in a metal \n\nfinger. With this configuration, temperature uncertainty leads to an additional error of 0.04 % \n\nin speed of sound. According to the pressure range investigated, two identical manometers \n\n(HOTTING BALDWIN MESSTECHNIK MVD 2510) were used to measure the pressure. \n\nOne is calibrated in the full pressure scale (with an uncertainty of 0.2 MPa) whereas the other \n\n\n\n \n\n140 \n \n\nis only calibrated up to 100 MPa in order to achieve a better accuracy in this range (0.02 \n\nMPa). These pressure sensor involve an error in speed of sound less than 0.1 % up to 100 MPa \n\nand 0.2 % between (100 and 200) MPa. Consequently the overall experimental uncertainty in \n\nthe reported speed of sound values is estimated to be 0.2 % between (0.1 and 100) MPa and \n\n0.3 % between (100 and 210 MPa). \n\nDensity of biodiesels was measured by a densimeter ANTON-PAAR mPDS 2000 V3 \n\nconnected to a high pressure volumetric pump working up to 100 MPa. The principle of this \n\napparatus is to measure the period of oscillation of a U-shape tube and to deduce the density \n\nwhich is related to the square of the period by a linear law. Vacuum and a liquid of reference \n\nwere to determine the parameters of this linear function. Water and hexane were considered as \n\nreference. The temperature of the densimeter is controlled by an external circulating fluid \n\nusing thermostatic bath (HUBER MINISTAT 125) and is measured with a Pt100 with an \n\nuncertainty of ? 0.1 K in the temperature range investigated. The pressure is transmitted to the \n\ncell by the liquid itself using a volumetric pump and measured with a HBM pressure gauge \n\n(with an uncertainty of 0.2 MPa) fixed on the circuit linking the pump to the U-tube cell. \n\nTaking into account the uncertainty of the temperature, the pressure, the density of the \n\nreference fluid as well as the error in the measurements of the period of oscillation for the \n\nvacuum and for both the reference and the studied liquid, the overall experimental uncertainty \n\nin the reported density values is estimated to be ? 0.5 kg/m\n3\n (0.06 %).  \n\n \n\n3.7.2. Results and discussion \n\nThe experimental data of speed of sound here measured was used to assess an \n\nextension of the Wada\u2019s model to high pressures. This extension is described by Eq. (3.7.1)  \n\n? ? ? ? ? ? 22\n000\n\n, TPPbTPPauPTu ?????       (3.7.1) \n\nwhere u0 (m/s) is the atmospheric speed of sound predicted with the Wada\u2019s model at the \n\nreference pressure P0, T (K) is the absolute temperature and P (MPa) is the absolute pressure. \n\nThe parameters a and b are the fitting parameters whose values were estimated by fitting the \n\nEq.(3.7.1) to the experimental high pressure speeds of sound of methyl caprate reported by \n\n\n\n \n\n141 \n \n\nNdiaye et al [221].

Using this model the experimental data of speed of sound at high-\n\npressure were predicted with an AADs of 0.54 % for biodiesel S and 0.52 % for biodiesel R \n\nand an overall value (OAAD) of 0.53 % as shown in Table 3.7.1. \n\nTable 3.7. 1.

High pressure viscosity of biodiesel fuels: measurement and \nprediction \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThis part of work reports new experimental data of high-pressure viscosities for \n\nthree biodiesel fuels (soybean, rapeseed and their binary mixture) measured at \n\ntemperatures from 283.15 K to 393.15 K and pressures from atmospheric up to 140 \n\nMPa and proposes a correlation capable of describing the experimental data. The \n\nFAME compositions of biodiesels are already presented in Section 3.2. The \n\nmeasurements of viscosity were done by Prof. Dr. Jos\u00e9 Juan Segovia Puras at the \n\nUniversity of Valladolid, Spain.   \n\n\n\n \n\n146 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n147 \n \n\n3.8.1. Introduction \n\nThe modern injection system called \u201ccommon rail injection systems\u201d uses high \n\npressures (up to 200 MPa) to pump the fuel and avoid the leakage [223, 224]. At this point, the \n\nprior knowledge of high-pressure viscosities of biodiesel becomes crucial for previewing the \n\nengine performance and the quality of emissions. Most data available in the literature reports \n\nthe temperature dependency of viscosity for biodiesel fuels at atmospheric pressure. Only few \n\nworks have focused on measuring and predicting the high-pressure viscosities of biodiesel \n\nfuels and their blends with petrodiesel [223-227]. Thereat, this work aims to report new \n\nexperimental data of high- pressure viscosity for three methylic biodiesels (soybean, rapeseed \n\nand their binary mixture) measured at temperatures from 283.15 to 393.15 K and pressures \n\nfrom atmospheric to 140 MPa, and to propose a correlation capable of predicting them and \n\ntheir mixtures with petrodiesel.  \n\n \n\n3.8.2. Experimental section \n\nThe three biodiesel samples here studied: Soybean (S), Rapeseed (R) and their binary \n\nmixture (SR) are already described in Section 3.2.  \n\n The experimental measurements of high-pressure viscosities were done using a \n\nvibrating-wire instrument developed in the TERMOCAL laboratory (Figure 3.8.1). This \n\ninstrument is capable of operating at temperatures between 273.15 and 423.15K and at \n\npressures up to 140 MPa. Calibration was performed by means of measurements in vacuum, \n\nair, and toluene. The estimated uncertainty of the results is 1 % in viscosity. \n\nThe vibrating wire viscometer has been designed to operate in the viscosity range 0.3\u2013\n\n30 mPa\u00b7s. The vibrating wire and magnetic assembly were housed in a commercially-available \n\npressure vessel HIP rated for operation at 140 MPa, this vessel was immersed in a bath Hart \n\nScientific 6020. The temperature of the fluid was measured using two platinum resistance \n\nthermometer (PRT) and a ASL F100 thermometer. This thermometer was calibrated with an \n\nuncertainty of \u00b10.02 K. The pressure was measured in the external pipework by means of a \n\nDruck DPI 104 transducer, with a full scale reading of 140 MPa and an uncertainty of \u00b1 0.02 \n\n% kPa/kPa. The pressure was generated by a HiP pump, model 68-5.75-15. \n\n\n\n \n\n148 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8. 1. vibrating wire vibrating wire sensor for 150 \u00b5m wire diameter: (1) flow tube, (2) end \n\nsupport, (3) clamp, (4) pin, (5) cap-head screws. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.8.3. Results and discussion \n\n The experimental viscosities of the three biodiesels here studied are presented in Table \n\n3.8.1 where it is seen, as expected, that the magnitude of viscosity is higher for saturated \n\nbiodiesel at the same temperature and pressure (i.e., biodiesel R is more viscous than biodiesel \n\nS) and increases with the pressure due to the increasing molecular interactions (i.e., the \n\nmolecules become more compacted with the pressure rise).  \n\nTable 3.8. 1.

For that \n\npurpose two set of compounds were used to develop a correlation described by Equation \n\n(3.8.1)  \n\n        (3.8.1) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n150 \n \n\nwith ? being the dynamic viscosity in mPa.s, P the absolute pressure in MPa, T is the absolute \n\ntemperature in K and a and b the fitting parameters. The experimental data reported by \n\nDuncan et al [223] were used as the training set to adjust the values of the fitting parameters a \n\nand b. The validation set was the three biodiesel here studied (S, R and SR).   \n\nThe values of 1.2 and 0.84 were obtained respectively for parameters a and b with \n\nwhich the Eq. (3.8.1) predicts very well the experimental data, presenting only an OARD of \n\n3.0 % for the training set and of 3.9 % for the validation set in the temperature range of 283\u2013\n\n393 K and pressure range of 0.1\u2013140 MPa as seen in Table 3.8.2.  \n\n \n\nTable 3.8. 2. ARDs of viscosity for biodiesels at high pressure \n\n \n\nThe behavior of the correlation here developed for both set of compounds can be seen \n\nseparately in Figures 3.8.1 and 3.8.2 for the training and validation sets. The adequacy of this \n\ncorrelation to describe the pressure dependency of dynamic viscosity of biodiesels at different \n\ntemperatures for the validation set is shown in the Figures 3.8.3-3.8.5 where the three \n\nbiodiesels studied presented higher deviations only at the lowest temperature of 283.15 K, \n\nwhile for all other temperatures the deviations are low. This approach can be easily extended \n\nto predict the high pressure viscosities of any biodiesel provided that the atmospheric pressure \n\nvalues are known either experimentally or can be estimated as we proposed in a previous work \n\n[145].  \n\nReference Biodiesel ARD, % \n\n  Training set Validation set \n\nDuncan et al [224] Soybean1 3.0  \n\nDuncan et al [223] Soybean2 3.6  \n\n Canola 3.1  \n\n Canola used 2.9  \n\n Vistive 2.7  \n\n Coconut 2.5  \n\nThis work S  3.7 \n\n R  4.7 \n\n SR  3.1 \n\n OARD, % 3.0 3.9 \n\n\n\n \n\n151 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8. 2.

To do this, however, a separate parameter fitting of Eq. (1) was done for diesel \n\nusing the experimental data reported by Duncan et al [224] The values of 134.5 and 1.6 were \n\nobtained for a and b, respectively.

Using the equations (3.8.1) and (3.8.2) \n\ntogether, the prediction of high-pressure viscosities of the blends was excellent, presenting \n\nonly an OARD of 3.3 % as shown in Table 3.8.3.

Lines are the results predicted with the the \n\nGrundberg-Nissan mixing rules using the molar fraction approach. \n\n \n\nIn practice, however, the informations about the blends of biodiesels with diesel fuel \n\nare normally given in volume fractions and sometimes there are no data on molecular weight \n\nand also density of diesel fuel (at different temperatures) to convert the volume fraction into \n\nthe molar fraction to be used in the Eq. (3.8.1). So, this work tried to use directly the volume \n\nfraction in the Grundberg Nissan equation, instead of molar fraction, according to the Eq. \n\n(3.8.3) to predict the experimental high-pressure viscosities of the blends, where vdiesel and \n\nvbiodiesel are the volume fractions of diesel and biodiesel in the blended fuel, respectively \n\n \n\n   (3.8.3) \n\n \n\nFortunately the results of prediction using this approach are equal to that using the molar \n\nfraction, suggesting that one can use it to calculate the viscosities of the blends.

Conclusions \n\n  New experimental data of high-pressure viscosity for three methylic biodiesels, \n\nmeasured at temperature from 283.15 to 393.15 K and pressures from atmospheric to 140 MPa \n\nwere here reported and a correlation to predict the viscosities at high pressure for the \n\nbiodiesels is proposed based on literature data. It is shown that this correlation provides good \n\npredictions for the viscosities of the studied biodiesels and, coupled with the Grundberg-\n\nNissan mixing rules, describes very well the experimental data of viscosity for biodiesel fuels \n\nblends with diesel, presenting OARDs of 3.9 and 3.3 %, respectively. This good description of \n\nthe data suggests that this correlation can be extended to the prediction of the viscosity of \n\nother biodiesel fuels provided that experimental viscosity at atmospheric pressure is known.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n158 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n159 \n \n\n3.9. High-Pressure density of vegetable oils \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThis work is already submitted to the Journal of Chemical Engineering Data. \n\nBecause there was no equipment at our laboratory for measuring the high-\n\npressure densities of the vegetable oils, the experimental measurement of density \n\nwas done in Spain at the University of Vigo by Prof. Manuel Pi\u00f1eiro and his \n\ngroup. The whole modeling part was done by myself.  \n\n\n\n \n\n160 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n161 \n \n\n3.9.1. Introduction \n\nFor any fluid and process, density is important as it gives enough information about the \n\namount of material being processed and correlates with many other transport and acoustic \n\nproperties such as viscosity, surface tension, volatility, and speed of sound, among others that \n\nare not only necessary for an efficient design, control and optimization of operation conditions \n\nbut also for a reliable development of models. Density data is also important for the high \n\npressure processing of vegetable oils as already stated in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of this thesis. \n\nNevertheless, there is little information concerning the measurement of high-pressure density \n\nof vegetable oils, and much less the models to predict their behavior. Some experimental data \n\nare only available at atmospheric pressure.  \n\nThis work aims to provide the experimental densities of seven different vegetable oils \n\nat temperatures from 283.15 to 363.15 K and pressures from 0.1 to 45 MPa, correlating them \n\nusing the modified Tait-Tammann equation and using them to evaluate the predictive ability \n\nof the three versions of GCVOL group contribution method, the Halvorsen\u2019s model and the \n\nZong\u2019s Fragment-Based Approach model. The development of a high pressure extension of \n\nthese models will also be here proposed. \n\n \n\n3.9.2. Experimental details \n\n \n\n3.9.2.1. Samples and density measurement \n\nOils of soybean (S), rapeseed (R), sunflower (Sf), castor (C), palm (P), Aleurites \n\nmoluccana (Am) and Jatropha curcas (Jc) were here used. The first five oils were obtained \n\nfrom Portuguese companies (S from Bunge Ib\u00e9rica Portugal SA, Sf, P and R from Sovena and \n\nC from Jos\u00e9 M. Vaz Pereira SA) while the last two non-edible oils were obtained by solid-\n\nliquid extraction of the corresponding seeds in a Soxlet with n-hexane. The composition of \n\nfatty acids in these oils was measured by conversion of the oil into fatty esters. The fatty acid \n\nprofiles of the biodiesel S, P, Sf and R are already presented in the section 3.2 and those of the \n\ntwo non-edible oils (Am and Jc) and the castor oil (C) are presented here in Table 3.9.1. The \n\n\n\n \n\n162 \n \n\nconversion of these oils into biodiesels was done using the methodology of Ghadge et al [228] \n\nwhose details are described in Chapter 5. The experimental procedure of density \n\nmeasurement is already described in Section 3.2.  \n\nTable 3.9. 1.

Density models \n\nThe modified Tait-Tammann equation [229], the GCVOL group contribution method, \n\nthe Halvorsen\u2018s model [230, 231] and the Zong\u2019s Fragment-Based Approach model [232] \n\nwere here used to describe the temperature and pressure dependency of densities of vegetable \n\noils. The first two approaches were previously applied elsewhere with success to the \n\ndescription of the experimental densities of fatty esters [151, 152] and biodiesels [128]. \n\n3.9.3.1. Modified Tait-Tammann correlation  \n\nThis correlation relates density (? in g/cm\n3\n) with temperature (T in K) and pressure (P \n\nin MPa) in a polynomial form, involving several fitting parameters according to the Eqs. \n\n(3.9.1) to (3.9.3) that are adjusted to the experimental data.  \n\n\n\n \n\n163 \n \n\n? ?\n? ?\n? ???\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n1.0\n1\n\n1.0,\n\nB\n\nPB\nC\n\nMPaPT?\n?\n\n       (3.9.1) \n\nwhere \n\n2\n\n321\n)1.0,( TaTaaMPaPT ?????\n\n     \n\n (3.9.2) \nand \n\n2\n\n321\nTbTbbB ???\n\n        (3.9.3) \n\n \n\n3.9.3.2. Halvorsen\u2019s model \n\nThis model is detailed in Halvorsen et al [230]. Shortly it combines the fatty acid \n\ncritical properties and the respective composition to predict the density of oils using the eq. \n\n(3.9.4), \n\n    (3.9.4) \n\nwhere ?oil (g/cm\n3\n) is the density of the vegetable oil, R (cm\n\n3\n.bar/(mol.K) is the universal gas \n\nconstant, Tr is the reduced temperature, Fc is a correction factor characteristic of the oil, xi is \n\nthe mole fraction, MWi (g/mol) is the fatty acid molecular weight, PCi (bar) is the critical \n\npressure, ZRAi is the Rackett parameter and TCi (K) is the critical temperature. \n\nThe Tr and Fc can be estimated using the eqs.

Zong\u2019s model \n\nZong et al [232] developed a fragment- based approach to estimate the thermophysical \n\nproperties of triglyceride mixtures. In case of density, this can be calculated using the Eq. \n\n(3.9.9), where ?oil is the oil density and ?i the density of triglyceride i (in g/cm\n3\n) and wi the \n\nmass fraction of triglyceride i. \n\n??\ni i\n\ni\n\noil\n\nw\n??\n\n11\n\n        (3.9.9)\n \n\nThis approach requires the knowledge of representative triglyceride molecules. Then, \n\nthe density of each triglyceride molecule is simply estimated from its molar volume using the \n\nEq. (3.8.10), where VA\nl \nis the liquid molar volume contribution of fragment A (in cm\n\n3\n/mol) \n\nand Nfrag,A is the number of fragment A in the oil. \n\n)(\n,\n\nTVNV\nA\n\nl\n\nAAfrag\n\nl\n\n??\n        (3.8.10) \n\nThe temperature dependency of liquid molar volume, VA\nl\n, is given by Eq.

The extended version uses the parameters reported by Ihmels et al [142]and the \n\nrevised version uses the parameters proposed by Pratas et al [128]. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n166 \n \n\n3.9.4. Results and discussions \n\nThe experimental densities for seven vegetable oils measured at temperatures from \n\n283.15 to 363.15 K and pressures from atmospheric to 45 MPa are reported in Table 3.9.2.The \n\ndensity differs between the oils according to the nature of fatty acids that compose the oil, \n\nfollowing the same trends previously observed for biodiesels [128]. The unsaturated oils have \n\ndensities higher than those of saturated oils. However the effect of unsaturation level seems to \n\noutweigh the effect of carbon chain length and thus, for the same level of unsaturation, the \n\ndensity of the short-chain oils is not necessarily higher than that of the longer ones. At similar \n\nconditions, the density of sunflower oil, highly unsaturated, is higher than that of palm oil, \n\nwith low unsaturated content, even though this has shorter chain length than that the other.  \n\n \n\nTable 3.9. 2.

Using these \n\nproperties, along with the fatty acid composition, the description of densities for seven \n\nvegetable oils was excellent with an OARD of only 0.34% (Table 3.9.4). Nevertheless, the \n\nrelative deviations are slightly temperature-dependent with a maximum of 1.4 %, especially \n\nfor the castor oil, as shown in Figure 3.9.4. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9. 4.

Thus, the first step of prediction was the building up of the triglyceride molecules \n\nto represent the fatty acid fragments present in oils. For example, Zong et al [232] used 8 of 33 \n\nrepresentative triglyceride molecules to describe successfully the experimental densities of \n\nthree Brazilian oils (buriti oil, brazil nut oil and grape seed oil) with an average relative \n\ndeviation of less than 0.80 %. Since on this work the composition of the oil in triglycerides \n\nwas unknown, and only the fatty acid profile was available, to use this method we defined \n\npseudocompounds to describe the oil composition. The pseudocomponents were triglycerides, \n\nformed by three identical fatty acids, with compositions defined to match the fatty acid profile \n\nof the oils as reported in Table 3.9.5.  \n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n270 290 310 330 350 370\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n.[\n\n(?\nc\na\nlc\n-?\n\ne\nx\np\n)/\n\n?\ne\nx\np\n]\n\nT, K\n\n\n\n \n\n171 \n \n\nTable 3.9. 5.

Based on these parameters, the Zong\u2019s model provided a good description \n\nof the density of the six vegetable oils here studied, with an OARD of 1.2 % (Table 3.9.4). \n\nThe density of castor oil was not predicted with this method because there were no values of \n\nparameters B1,A and B2,A for the ricinoleic acid. This model produced deviations that are \n\nalmost stable over the range of temperatures studied, with a maximum of 2.5 % as shown in \n\nFigure 3.9.5. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9. 5.

This method was then \n\napplied in three different versions according to the values of parameters Ai, Bi, and Ci for the \n\ngroups described above. As stated above, the original version used the parameters reported by \n\nElbro et al [141]. The extended version used the parameters reported by Ihmels et al [142] and \n\nthe revised version used the new parameters proposed by Pratas et al [128] to describe the \n\nunsaturation group.  \n\nBetween the three versions of the GCVOL method studied, the revised version was the \n\nmost adequate form to describe the temperature dependency of density for oils with an OARD \n\nof only 1.1 % followed by the extended version with an OARD of 2.6 %. The original version \n\npresented a very high deviation (OARD of 6.3 %). For all cases the deviations are somewhat \n\ntemperature-dependent with a maximum of 2.5 % for the revised version. The performance of \n\nthe revised GCVOL method is presented in Figure 3.9.6. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9. 6.

Conclusions \n\nThe experimental data of high pressure densities for seven vegetable oils were here \n\nreported for temperatures ranging from 283.15 to 363.15 K and pressures from atmospheric to \n\n45 MPa. These data were correlated with the Tait-Tammann equation and used to assess the \n\nadequacy of GCVOL group contribution method, Halvorsen\u2019s model and Zong\u2019s model for \n\nprediction of vegetable oils density. The Halvorsen\u2019s model and Zong\u2019s model described very \n\nwell the temperature dependency of oil density with overall average relative deviations \n\n(OARDs) of 0.34 and 1.1 %, respectively. Between the three versions of the GCVOL method \n\nstudied, the revised version was the most adequate for prediction of the densities of oils, \n\npresenting an OARD of 1.2 %. An extension of the models here studied to high pressure was \n\nalso proposed. The models provided very good predictions of density with OARDs of 0.75, \n\n1.04 and 0.41 % for the models of Halvorsen, Zong and revised GCVOL, respectively and the \n\ndeviations were just slightly pressure-dependent with a maximum deviation of less than 2.0 %.\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n.[\n\n(?\nc\na\n\nl\n-\n\n?\ne\nx\n\np\n)/\n\n?\ne\nx\n\np\n]\n\nP, MPa\n\n\n\n \n\n176 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n177 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\n \n\n \n\nModeling the Thermodynamic Properties of Fatty Esters \n\nand Biodiesels with the Soft-SAFT EoS \n\n \n\n \nThis chapter concerns the use of Soft-SAFT EoS to compute the thermodynamic properties of \n\nfatty esters (FAME and FAEE) and biodiesels. As these molecules are non-self-associating \n\nfluids, their properties were defined by only three molecular parameters: mi (chain length), ?ii \n\n(segment diameter) and ?ii/kB (dispersive energy between segments). The results for several \n\nproperties of fatty esters and biodiesels like density, surface tension, speed of sound and \n\nviscosity are here presented both at atmospheric and at high pressure.  \n\nThe completeness of this chapter was achieved with the direct cooperation of Dr. Mariana \n\nBelo from our group and Dr. Felix Llovel from Matgas, in Barcelona.  The biodiesels here \n\nstudied were the ten described earlier in Chapter 3. Other calculations were done by me. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n178 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n179 \n \n\n4.1. Introduction \n\nSo far many works have been dedicated to predict the thermophysical properties of \n\nbiodiesels, as well as of fatty esters that compose them, to assess their quality as fuel. Accurate \n\nthermodynamic properties are needed over a wide range of temperature and pressure to \n\noptimize biodiesel production, processing and application. Unfortunately most of the available \n\ndata do not cover wide ranges of temperature and pressure. So Chapter 3 exposes the \n\nexperimental and predicted data for several properties of feed oils, biodiesels and fatty esters \n\nwith an emphasis on high-pressures.   \n\nThe molecular based equations of state (EoS) are also an alternative tool to compute \n\nthese properties.  CPA EoS, for example has been used to predict thermodynamic properties of \n\nsome pure esters and biodiesels as density [140] and surface tensions and vapor pressure as \n\nalready described in Sections 3.2 and 3.4, respectively. This chapter aims at applying a variant \n\nof SAFT (Statistical Associating Fluid Theory), soft-SAFT, for describing the thermodynamic \n\nproperties of fatty esters. This variant of SAFT has been used with success in many works to \n\nmodel the thermodynamic properties, phase behavior and critical behavior of alkanes [234], \n\nalkanols [235], perfluoroalkanes [236, 237],  ionic liquids (ILs) [238] and of several \n\npoly(ethylene glycol) mixtures [239]. The solubility behavior of several gases such as CO2, \n\nH2, and Xe in ILs [240], water [241-243], alkanes [234, 244] and perfluoroalkanes [245, 246] \n\nwas also successfully described with this equation. There is still no work, however, addressing \n\nthe description of fatty esters thermodynamic properties using soft-SAFT EoS. Consequently, \n\nthis chapter will present new sets of molecular parameters capable of computing density, \n\nsurface tension, speed of sound and viscosity of fatty esters in a wide range of temperatures \n\nand pressures.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n180 \n \n\n4.2. The soft-SAFT EoS \n\nAccording to the type of the reference fluid adopted, there are several variant of the \n\nSAFT EoS, all of them based on the Wertheim\u2019s first-order thermodynamic perturbation \n\ntheory. The original version developed by Chapman et al [247] uses the hard-sphere fluid as \n\nreference fluid; the SAFT-VR developed by Gil-Villegas et al [248] uses the square-well fluid \n\nwith a variable range; the PC-SAFT proposed by Gross et al [249] uses the hard-chain fluid \n\nand the soft-SAFT, developed by Blas and Vega [250, 251] and applied in this work uses the \n\nLennard- Jones fluid as reference. \n\nThe soft-SAFT is an accurate version of SAFT written, as all other versions, in terms \n\nof a sum of contributions to the total Helmholtz free energy of the system: [252, 253] \n\n (4.1) \n\nWhere a\nres\n\n and a\nid\n\n are the residual Helmholtz free energy and the ideal contribution, \n\nrespectively. Subsequently, ref, chain, assoc and polar represent the reference term, the chain \n\nformation, the association and the polar interactions. \n\nFor the reference term, soft-SAFT uses Lennard-Jones (LJ) spherical fluid which takes \n\ninto account the repulsive and the attractive interactions of the monomers that constitute the \n\nchain. This term includes two molecular parameters representing the monomer: the segment \n\ndiameter, ?ii, and the dispersive energy between segments, ?ii/kB [254]. In our approach, the \n\nreference term is computed using the equation of Johnson et al [255]. \n\nThe chain and association terms derive directly from the following Wertheim\u2019s theory \n\n[256, 257], \n\n       (4.2) \n\n      (4.3) \n\nBeing ? the molecular density, T the temperature, m the chain length, xi the molar fraction of \n\ncomponent i, kB the Boltzman constant and gL,J the radial distribution function at density \n\n\n\n \n\n181 \n \n\nof a LJ spheres, with mi being the chain length parameter. The description of gL,J \n\nit given by the fitted computer simulation data, as a function of density and temperature, \n\nproposed by Johnson et al [255] Xi\n??\n\nis the fraction of pure component i not bonded at site ? \n\nand Mi the number of association sites of type ? in component i. Xi\n??\n\nis given by: \n\n       (4.4) \n\n The specific site-site function, ???,ij, is described as: \n\n         (4.5) \n\nBeing K??,ij the site-site bonding-volume of association and the Mayer f-function: \n\n        (4.6) \n\nThe Mayer function includes the site-site association energy parameter . \n\nWithin the soft-SAFT framework, non-self-associating molecules are defined by three \n\nmolecular parameters: the chain length, mi, the segment diameter, ?ii, and the dispersive \n\nenergy between segments, ?ii/kB. For associating molecules two more parameters are included \n\nto model the associating interactions: the site-site association energy,???,ij\nHB\n\n/kB, and the site-\n\nsite bonding-volume of association, K??,ij. \n\nThe Density Gradient Theory (DGT) was coupled to the soft-SAFT equation to \n\ncompute interfacial properties. DGT was first proposed by van der Waals [258] and then \n\nrediscovered by Cahn et al [259]. The expression for the Helmholtz energy of the system is \n\ngiven by: \n\n      (4.7) \n\n\n\n \n\n182 \n \n\nwhere a0 ??) is the Helmholtz free energy density of the homogeneous fluid at the local density \n\n? and ?i  is the molar density of component i. cij is the influence parameter that is assumed to \n\nbe temperature independent. Its value is normally regressed from interfacial tension \n\nexperimental data. \n\n Assuming a planar interface and neglecting the cij density dependence it is possible to \n\nderive an expression relating interfacial tensions and the square of the density gradient [260]:\n \n\n   (4.8) \n\nWhere ?0i and p0 are the equilibrium chemical potential and pressure, respectively, and z is the \n\ndirection perpendicular to the interface. Further details about the implementation of the DGT \n\napproach into soft-SAFT can be found in previous works [261, 262]. \n\nThe derivative properties of a thermodynamic potential function can be written in \n\nseveral ways. They can be considered as derivatives of the Helmholtz energy and the pressure, \n\nwhich are direct calculations from the soft-SAFT equation. Hence, the expressions for the \n\nmain derivative properties calculated in this work are: \n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n2\n\n2\n\nT\n\nA\nTC\n\nV          (4.9) \n\nT\n\nT\n\nP\nk ??\n\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?

(K\n-1\n\n) is the thermal expansion coefficient, Cp is the isobaric heat capacity \n\n(J/(mol.K) and u (m/s) is the speed of sound. \n\n The calculation of viscosity with the soft-SAFT EoS is normally done by coupling it \n\nwith the Friction Theory (FT) or the free-volume theory (FVT). Both theories divide the \n\ndynamic viscosity into two parts according to the Eq. (4.15) but use differently the dense-state \n\ncorrection term.  \n\n??? ???\n0           (4.15) \n\nIn the equation above ?0 is the viscosity of dilute gas given by Chung et al [263], and ?? is the \n\ndense-state correction term.

The molar density ? (in mol/cm\n3\n) is the only property derived from the EOS. Equation \n\n4.17 is an approximation of the intermolecular energy. Its first term is considered to be the \n\nenergy barrier a molecule has to overcome to diffuse, and the second term is considered to be \n\n\n\n \n\n184 \n \n\nthe energy needed to form a vacant passage for the diffusion. E is interpreted as the flow \n\nenergy barrier only.  \n\nAt last the application of FVT requires three additional parameters related to the \n\nviscosity of the pure fluid. L is the length parameter [\u00c5], absorbing the average quadratic \n\nlength, which is related to the structure of the molecules and the characteristic relaxation time, \n\n? is the proportionality between the energy barrier and the density in J m\n3\n/(mol kg) and B is a \n\npositive number characteristic of the free-volume overlap. Using a transferable approach, the \n\n? parameter is taken from the equivalent n-alkane, while the remaining two parameters B and \n\nLv are fitted to viscosity data of the pure fluid at several isobars [266]. \n\n \n\n4.3. Results and discussion \n\nSeveral thermodynamic properties of fatty esters (FAME and FAEE) namely density, \n\nsurface tension, speed of sound and viscosity were here computed with the soft-SAFT EoS at \n\nwide ranges of temperature and pressure using only three molecular parameters: the chain \n\nlength, mi, the segment diameter, ?ii, and the dispersive energy between segments, ?ii/kB and \n\nsome other fitting parameters like influence parameter (c) for surface tension and parameters \n\n??????and L for viscosity. The results for each property are described below.  \n\n \n\n4.3.1. Regression of molecular parameters \n\nAs already stated earlier, and similarly to alkanes, the fatty esters molecules are non-\n\nself-associating fluids and so, within the Soft-SAFT EoS framework, their properties can be \n\neffectively defined by the three molecular parameters aforementioned. Before doing a separate \n\noptimization of these parameters for FAME, however, as this work is an extension of our \n\nprevious works [251, 267] and given that soft-SAFT EoS has the ability to provide \n\ntransferable parameters from a certain family of compounds to those of other families, we \n\nstarted the description of FAME thermodynamic properties using the molecular parameters \n\ncorrelated directly from the trend lines of alkanes [251, 266, 267] . The results, however, were \n\n\n\n \n\n185 \n \n\nfar from acceptable, i.e., the slopes of the predicted and the experimental densities did not \n\nmatch each other when depicting them in the same representation as illustrated in Figure 4.1 \n\nfor methyl caprate, methyl palmitate and methyl stearate.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4 1. Density vs. temperature for FAME at atmospheric pressure. Symbols represent \n\nexperimental data  Methyl caprate,  Methyl palmitate and  Methyl stearate. Lines are the soft-\n\nSAFT results using the molecular parameters correlated from alkanes \n\nThis deviation may be due to the fact that  the convergence criteria of this EoS is \n\nhighly sensitive to the initial conditions, on the one hand, and the fluids (alkanes and esters) \n\nare quite different due to the presence of the ester group, on the other hand. Thereat, new sets \n\nof molecular parameters were regressed for FAME, at a strict reduced-temperature (Tr) range, \n\nusing the experimental data of vapor pressure and liquid density reported respectively by Yuan \n\net al [161] and Pratas et al [151, 152]. The results are presented in Table 4.1.

Speed of sound \n\nUnlike the surface tension, no extra fitting parameter is required in the algorithm of \n\nsoft SAFT beyond the molecular parameters for the estimation of speeds of sound. \n\nConsequently the speeds of sound of fatty esters were calculated in soft-SAFT using the \n\nEq. 4.14 \n\nThe soft SAFT provides all the variables involved in the equations above except the \n\nCp whose values reported in the output of soft-SAFT were only residual while the \n\nprediction of speed of sound needs the contribution of the ideal Cp. The ideal Cp was \n\ncalculated using the Joback\u2019s group contribution method [233]. The results are illustrated \n\nin Figures 4.19 and 4.20 for several FAME and FAEE, respectively. The high-pressure \n\nspeeds of sound were also predicted by soft-SAFT for some esters. The results are shown \n\nin Figures 4.21 to 4.23e, for methyl caprate, methyl oleate and ethyl laurate. The lag \n\nbetween the experimental and predicted data is high but its magnitude is almost equal for \n\nthe majority of esters. This deviation could be solved within the algorithm of soft-SAFT \n\nthrough a fitting parameter.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 19. Atmospheric speeds of sound for FAME at different temperatures.

Conclusions \n\n  \n\nThe ability of soft-SAFT to describe and predict several thermodynamic properties \n\nof fatty acid esters and biodiesels was here tested. It is here shown that this model was \n\ncapable of computing several properties of fatty esters and biodiesels using only three \n\nmolecular parameters: mi (chain length), ?ii (segment diameter)and ?ii/kB (dispersive energy \n\nbetween segments) as these compounds are non-self-associating fluids. Using these \n\nparameters and some other fitting parameters like influence parameter for surface tension \n\nand ????? the overall average relative deviations (OARD) for FAME were \n\n0.49 % for the high-pressure density prediction, 2.4 % for surface tensions description and 3.7 % \n\nfor viscosity calculations. The OARD for FAEE were 1.8 % for high-pressure density, 2.6 % for \n\nsurface tensions and 1.4 % for viscosity description. The better description of high-pressure \n\ndensities for pure methyl esters also reflected in a better description of high pressure \n\ndensity of biodiesels.  \n\nThe unique challenge linked to the prediction process was about the transferability \n\nof the parameters. First, the molecular parameters correlated from alkane\u2019s trend lines were \n\nnot able to describe the densities of fatty esters. Second, even with the transferable \n\nmolecular parameters for FAME, the influence parameter and viscosity parameters were \n\n0.0\n\n5.0\n\n10.0\n\n15.0\n\n20.0\n\n25.0\n\n30.0\n\n0 50 100 150\n\n?\n??\n\nm\nP\n\na\n.s\n\n)\n\nP (MPa)\n\n\n\n \n\n217 \n \n\nfor FAEE correlated from the FAME trend lines were not able to compute the surface \n\ntension and viscosity of fatty acid ethyl esters. This situation happens due to the parameter \n\nvalues in terms of the convergence criteria. Howsoever, using all the parameters here \n\nstudied the predictions of high-pressure density and also viscosity of biodiesel fuels were \n\ndone with success.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n218 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n219 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n \n\nProduction of biodiesel from resources endogenous of \n\nTimor Leste  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThis chapter reports the production and the study of fuel properties of biodiesels from \n\nseveral non-edible oils preferentially those with high level of free fatty acids endogenous \n\nof Timor Leste. Production of methylic biodiesel directly from the oils of Jatropha curcas, \n\nAleurites moluccana and coffee waste was performed by me at our Laboratory with the \n\nyield of methyl esters obtained being superior to 93% and their fuel properties meet the \n\ninternational biodiesel standards.  \n\nThis section aims to, first, demonstrate these oils as a model for the utilization of \n\nbioresources in Timorese arid lands for cost-effective biodiesel production and, second, to \n\nasses the ability of the models described in Chapter 3 to predict the density, viscosity and \n\nsurface tensions of these biodiesels. The models used were revised GCVOL method for \n\ndensity, revised Yuan\u2019s model for viscosity and Mac-Sugden model with Knotts\u2019 \n\nparachors for surface tension.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n220 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n221 \n \n\n5.1. Introduction \n\nAs already highlighted in the introductory chapter of this thesis, the current social and \n\neconomic circumstances of Timor Leste ask for the development of biodiesel in the country. A \n\nbiodiesel refinery would be an adequate solution for the problems related to lack of electricity \n\nand jobs and mainly to poverty and deprivation. Biodiesel development is highly \n\nrecommended because, first, the exploration of the Timorese undersea fossil resources (oil and \n\ngas) has not been favorable for the population\u2019s life (the corresponding revenues have been \n\nplumping the Petroleum Fund but with no positive impacts on the incomes and the living \n\nconditions of the population). Second, a majority of population is subsistence farmers and so \n\ntheir productions will have appropriate destinations with the existence of a biodiesel refinery. \n\nThird, in a country with poor technology and know-how to manage the environmental \n\nproblems linked to the use of petroleum fuels, biodiesel is more benefic than petroleum based-\n\nfuels due to several benefits already mentioned in Chapter 1.  \n\nTo avoid direct confrontation between food supply and biodiesel production, the \n\nTimorese lands offer many feedstocks for biodiesel production. Among other existing plants, \n\nthe oleaginous plants like Aleurites moluccana (Am) and Jatropha curcas (Jc) are powerful \n\nsources for biodiesel production because they exist in abundance and are not used by Timorese \n\npeople as food, even if the Am oil is edible, their seeds can provide circa 30-60 % of oil [269], \n\ntheir cultivations do not require arable lands and the harvesting of seeds is done almost twice \n\nper year.  \n\nFor decades Timorese people used the Am (candle nut) tree for preparing traditional \n\ncoffins and the seeds and oil as medicinal and fuel for light. The oil has been used for treating \n\nburns, therapeutic massages and preventing stretch marks during pregnancy. During the \n\nIndonesian occupation, the seeds were sent to Indonesia for food purposes. Nowadays, the \n\nAcelda Company is processing them for cosmetic purposes. Howsoever, crude candlenut oil \n\ngenerally contains about 15 % free fatty acids [269]. In terms of the fatty acid profiles, the \n\nTimorese Am oil has a high percentage of oleic acid (18:1),  linoleic acid (C18:2) and palmitic \n\nacid (C16:0) [270].  \n\n\n\n \n\n222 \n \n\nRegarding Jatropha, there is plenty of information about it in the literature. It is a non-\n\nedible plant capable of growing in very poor soils or idle lands and its seeds contain circa 30 \n\n% to 40 % of oil. Unlike the Aleurites, Jatropha has not been used much by Timorese people. \n\nHowsoever, the oil contains about 14 % free fatty acid and in terms of fatty acid profiles it is \n\nrich of linoleic (C18:2) and stearic (C18:0) acids [271].  \n\nTimor Leste also has abundant coffee plantations especially in the occidental part of \n\nthe country. It has been crucial to the country\u2019s overall economy and has served as the primary \n\nsource of income for about 25 % of the country\u2019s population [65]. However, some works \n\nalready addressed the use of coffee waste oil or defective beans oil for biodiesel production \n\n[272, 273]. The main constituents of coffee oil are C16:0 and C18:2 [273]. This fact will value \n\nthe Timorese coffee in the international market.  \n\nThe specific objective of this work was to synthesize biodiesels from the oils of \n\nJatropha, Aleurites moluccana and coffee waste and to evaluate, on one hand, if their fuel \n\nproperties were comparable with those established in the standards and, on the other hand, \n\ncould be acceptably estimated using the predictive models previously proposed in Chapter 3.  \n\n \n\n5.2. Production of biodiesel from oils of Aleurites moluccana, Jatropha \n\ncurcas and coffee waste  \n\n \n\n5.2.1. Experimental section \n\n \n\n5.2.1.1. Materials \n\nOils of Am and Jc were obtained by solid-liquid extraction of the corresponding seeds \n\nin a Soxlet unit with 250 mL of n-hexane. The seeds were obtained directly from Timor Leste. \n\nCW oil was obtained by the same process from the wastes collected at the University of \n\nAveiro. Absolute methanol (CH3OH) (99.9 % quoted purity from Lab-Scan Analytical \n\nScience), sodium methoxide (CH3ONa) (95 % quoted purity from Aldrich) sulfuric acid \n\n(H2SO4) (95 % quoted purity from Sigma-Aldrich) and phosphoric acid (H3PO4) (85 % quoted \n\n\n\n \n\n223 \n \n\npurity from Panreac) were available at our Laboratory. The two potential feedstocks for \n\nbiodiesel production are shown in Figure 3.1.  \n\n \n\nFigure 5 1. The two potential feedstock sources for biodiesel production: Am (left image) and Jc \n(right image) \n\n \n\n5.2.1.2. Determination of free fatty acids (FFA) level \n\nBefore performing the synthesis of biodiesel, the level of free fatty acids (FFA) of the \n\noils was first determined by acid-base titration in order to formulate an adequate reaction for \n\nbiodiesel production. So 0.4 g of oil was dissolved in 50 mL of ethanol and titrated in \n\nduplicate with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).

The FFA level was expressed as oleic acid or linoleic acid because these fatty \n\nacids are dominant in the oils studied. The FFA levels, expressed as oleic acid, were 7.0 % for \n\nAm oil and 4.0 % for coffee waste oil. The FFA value of the Am oil is not as high as that \n\nreported by Harry et al [269], but is far above the threshold of the alkali-catalysed \n\ntransesterification reaction, meaning that the synthesis of biodiesel must involve at least one \n\nstep of esterification reaction.    \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n224 \n \n\n5.2.1.3. Synthesis of biodiesel \n\nThe production of biodiesel from these oils followed the methodology of Ghadge et al \n\n[228] as this methodology starts with at least two steps of esterification reactions in order to \n\nreduce the FFA level of the oil to a permissible value for the transesterification reaction. So \n\nthe whole process occurred in three steps: two esterifications reactions and one \n\ntransesterification reaction. The experiments were carried out in a 250 mL three necked round \n\nflask equipped with mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser and a thermometer. The flask was \n\ninitially filled with oil and heated to the desired reaction temperature. Then the catalyst \n\ndissolved in methanol was added to the flask to start the reaction.  \n\nThe esterification reactions occurred at 60 \u00baC using of 1 % in volume fraction of H2SO4 \n\nand 45 % (v/v) of methanol. Each esterification step took place during circa 2 h. After that, the \n\nreaction was stopped and the upper-phase containing the remaining methanol, glycerol and \n\ncatalyst was removed from the mixture in a separating funnel. The lower phase was used as \n\nfeedstock for further step of esterification reaction.  \n\nThe transesterification reaction also occurred at 60 \u00baC using 1 % (w/v) of sodium \n\nmethoxide as catalyst and 35 % (v/v) of methanol during 24 h under methanol reflux. The \n\nreaction time chosen was adopted for convenience and to guarantee a complete reaction \n\nconversion. After this period, the reaction was quenched by adding 1 % (v/v) of phosphoric \n\nacid with 85 % of purity. The final mixture was then separated in two phases in a separating \n\nfunnel. The upper phase (biodiesel) was then purified by washing with hot distillated water \n\nuntil a neutral pH was achieved and then dried in the oven during more than 2 h.  \n\nFour different biodiesels were produced from oils of: Am, Jc, Am +Jc and Am+CW. \n\nThe biodiesel production from pure CW oil was not performed due to the confusing \n\nvisualization (black color) in the phase separation.   \n\n \n\n5.2.1.4. Determination of FAME composition \n\nThe FAME composition in biodiesel samples was analysed by gas chromatography \n\nfollowing the same procedures described in Chapter 3. The yield of the FAME obtained after \n\n\n\n \n\n225 \n \n\nthe reaction was estimated using the equation 5.3 where wi is the mass fraction and mFAME is \n\nthe mass of FAME i and mBD is the mass of biodiesel.  \n\n  \n\n%100\n\n.\n\n(%) ??\n?\n\nmBD\n\nmFAMEw\n\nYield i\nii\n\n        (5.3) \n\n \n\n5.2.1.5. Measurement of density, viscosity and surface tension \n\nOnly three physical properties were here used to evaluate the ability of the models \n\ndescribed in Chapter 3 for description of density, viscosity and surface tension. Density and \n\nviscosity were measured in the temperature range of 288.15 to 368.15 K and at atmospheric \n\npressure using an automated SVM 3000 Anton Paar rotational Stabinger Viscometer following \n\nthe same procedure described in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. The surface tensions were measured at \n\ntemperature from 293.15 to 343.15 for two pure biodiesels (Am and Jc) using a Nima \n\nDynamic Surface Tensiometer, model DST9005, with a procedure described in Section 3.4.  \n\n5.2.2. Predictive models \n\nThe models chosen here to predict the density, viscosity and surface tension were the \n\nrevised GCVOL method, the revised Yuan\u2019s model and the Knotts Parachors\u2019s model, \n\nrespectively. Only these models were chosen to use here because they provided very good \n\npredictions of the experimental data of these properties for several biodiesels as highlighted in \n\nChapter 3.  \n\n\n\n \n\n226 \n \n\n5.2.3.

Biodiesel Am + Cw contains 45 mL of Am oil \n\nand 15 mL of CW oil \n\nThe FAME profiles of the oils are very similar to those reported in the literature. The \n\ncomposition of Jc oil is similar to that studied by Berchmans et al [274] and by Tiwari et al \n\n[271]. The composition of Am oil is also not so different from other Timorese samples studied \n\nby Ako et al [270] (these authors have studied the fatty acid profiles of different Am oils from \n\nTimor Leste). All the samples have C18:1 and C18:2 as major constituents. The slight \n\ndifferences in the composition between them may due to the rainfall, latitude or genetics and \n\nnot due to the differences of processing procedures.  \n\nTo verify if the biodiesels here produced had acceptable fuel properties, their density \n\nand viscosity where compare with the values established for biodiesel standards. Table 5.2 \n\nshows the properties of these biodiesels are within the limits.  \n\n\n\n \n\n227 \n \n\nTable 5. 2.

The data show that the most unsaturated biodiesel presents \n\nhigh values of density and surface tension and low values of viscosity. This result is literally \n\nexpected because the first two properties increase with the level of unsaturation while the last \n\ndecreases with this parameter as already shown elsewhere by Pratas et al [151, 152]. So, at the \n\nsame temperature, it is seen that Am biodiesel, being less saturated, presents density and \n\nsurface tension higher than those of Jc biodiesel while this presents viscosity higher than that.  \n\nAny disagreement between the values of biodiesel surface tensions may be due to the \n\nexperimental error.   \n\nTable 5. 3.

Conclusions \n\n \n\nFour methylic biodiesels were here produced from the oils endogenous of Timor Leste \n\nand their density, viscosity and surface tension were measured and predicted with the revised \n\nGCVOL group contribution method, the revised Yuan\u2019s model and the Knott\u2019s parachors \n\nmodel, respectively. The properties of biodiesels produced were within the standards and the \n\npredictions with the models were better for density and very acceptable for viscosity and \n\nsurface tension.  The OARDs obtained were 0.33 % for density, 3.8 % for viscosity and 2.1 % \n\nfor surface tension.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n234 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n235 \n \n\nGeneral conclusions \n\n \nThe key objectives of this thesis were achieved, i.e., it was able to produce/process \n\nbiodiesel from resources endogenous of Timor Leste and to study measurement/modeling of \n\nthe thermodynamic properties of biodiesels, vegetable oils and alkyl esters. \n\nConsidering the enzymatic synthesis of biodiesel, the production of multiphase lipase \n\nfermentation of Bacillus sp. ITP-001 was done. It was possible to improve the lipase \n\nproduction using oxygen vectors and good inducers. At the optimum production conditions \n\n(200 rpm and 20 % oxygen vector), perfluorodecaline increased the lipase activity to circa 4-\n\nfold, n-dodecane by about 11 % and silica A by about 29 %. Without oxygen vector, coffee \n\nwaste oil was the best inducer. But in presence of perfluorodecaline, coconut oil was the better \n\ninducer.  \n\nIn the study of the thermodynamic properties, new experimental data for various \n\nproperties such as density, viscosity, surface tension, vapor pressure and speed of sound for \n\nesters and biodiesel were provided. For vegetable oils only high-pressure densities were \n\nmeasured. Howsoever, various predictive models capable of describing well these \n\nexperimental data in a wide range of temperatures and pressures were recommended. For \n\ndensity, the revised GCVOL method is the most suitable for both biodiesel and vegetable oils. \n\nFor the latter, the model of Zong and Halvorsen also reveal to be good. For viscosity, the \n\nmodel of Yuan is recommended as it describes very well the viscosity of biodiesels. For \n\nsurface tension, the model of Mac-Sugden using the parachors of Knotts and the CPA model \n\nare recommended. For vapor pressure, the model of Yuan and CPA are the most suitable. For \n\nspeed of sound, various models are suitable from ideal mixture mixing rules, modified \n\nAuerbach to Wada\u2019s model. \n\nThe description of density and speed of sound of biodiesels at pressures up to 200 MPa \n\nwere also studied using a quadratic dependence of these properties on pressure. But at pressure \n\nup to 45 MPa, the linear approach using extensions of the models recommended above for \n\nthese properties is acceptable. \n\n\n\n \n\n236 \n \n\nThe modeling of thermodynamics with Soft-SAFT EoS was also done with success. \n\nThis EoS revealed to be adequate for predicting several properties of fatty esters and \n\nbiodiesels at wide range of temperature and pressures. \n\nThe production of biodiesel from Aleurites moluccana, Jatropha curcas and coffee \n\ngrounds was successfully studied. Their basic properties such as density and viscosity were \n\nshown to conform with the standards. The experimental data of these biodiesels plus those of \n\nethylic biodiesels produced from non-edible resources were used to test the adequacy of the \n\nmodels recommended above and the results were acceptable. Models of density, viscosity and \n\nsurface tension were able to describe the experimental data of biodiesels produced. Only the \n\nmodel of viscosity does not describe very well the viscosity of some ethylic biodiesels, but the \n\nmagnitude of the corresponding deviations is not very different from that obtained with other \n\nmodels not addressed in this work. \n\n\n\n \n\n237 \n \n\nFinal Remarks and Future Works \n\nThe main reason for having included the chapter 2 (production of lipase by Bacillus \n\nsp. ITP-001) in this thesis was to use lipase as catalyst in the enzymatic transesterification \n\nof biodiesel. Unfortunately, the processing of lipase did not achieve the final stage. The \n\nfermentation broths from bioreactor were only posteriorly purified but not dried nor \n\nimmobilized for further use in transesterification reactions. Consequently the enzymatic \n\nsynthesis of biodiesel was not performed. So the processing of lipase from the fermentation \n\nbroths that includes the lyophilization and immobilization on chemical or physical supports \n\ncan be an interesting future work in this field.  \n\nRegarding the modeling of thermodynamic properties, many basic fuel properties \n\nof biodiesels were studied especially at atmospheric pressure. The calculations of heat of \n\ncombustion of biodiesels were not concluded and could not be included in this thesis. \n\nThese works can also be done in near future. Moreover, given the high adequacy of soft-\n\nSAFT equation of state to describe the high-pressure densities and viscosities of biodiesel \n\nfuels, it is recommended to continue modeling with this EoS other properties of methylic \n\nor ethylic biodiesel fuels like surface tension and vapor pressure both at atmospheric \n\npressure and mainly at high pressure.  \n\nFinally, to better analyze the fuel properties of biodiesel fuel, some other properties \n\nbeyond those already studied here must also be evaluated. The analysis of oxidation \n\nstability, quality of emissions and biodegradability can be a future work of great relevance. \n\nThe biodiesels from the resources endogenous of Timor Leste were here produced and \n\ntheir properties were analysed, but, for the practical applications, the study about them \n\nmust be extended. In the future one can blend them with diesel fuels to study the \n\noutcoming properties as fuel. The production plant of biodiesel can also be simulated with \n\nsome simulation tools like Aspen.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n238 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n239 \n \n\nList of Publications \nPratas, M.J., S.V.D.
