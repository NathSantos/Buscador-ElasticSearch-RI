E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nABSTRACT \nThe present world energy scenario requires the development of \nalternative and sustainable energy sources and conversion systems that \nalso result in an overall smaller impact in the environment. The efficient \nuse of renewable energy sources for the production of electrical power \nin decentralized and isolated systems, as well as for the mobility sector, \nstands out as a possible ingredient to mitigate the environmental \naggression from energy systems. Fuel cells are electrochemical devices \nthat convert internal energy of chemical bond in electricity and heat \npower in an efficient, noiseless and lower emissions form. The relative \nhigh cost of system development suggests that a combined \nmeasurement, theoretical and simulation effort is the way to achieve the \nrequired breakthroughs. The main objective of the present thesis is to \ndevelop a theory for mass transport in a PEM fuel cell from a \nphenomenological analysis based on the fundamentals of the \nmulticomponent, multiphase mass transport in porous media. The model \naims at predicting the electric and mass transport behaviors with a \nformulation suitable for solution with current computational resources. \nTo this end, the characteristic length scales of the different components \nand phenomena within the fuel cell were revised aiming at determining \nthe relations between thermodynamic, electric and electrochemical \nprocesses in a PEM fuel cell. The vast amount of information on PEM \nfuel cell theory, modeling and simulation was reviewed with a view to \nclassify the different models, point out their applicability and define the \nneeds for further improvements. The polarization curve for a fuel cell \nsystem was measured with the purpose of identifying the controlling \ntransport and chemical phenomena, assess the applicability of the \navailable lumped models and to determine the orders of magnitude of \nglobal parameters characteristic of the fuel cell operation. Then, the \nfundamental theories of mass and charge transport in two-phase, \nmulticomponent flow in porous media were reviewed, focusing on the \ncontinuum and thermodynamic basis for the Maxwell-Stefan treatment \nof mass transport. Finally, a general phenomenological model for mass \nand charge transfer applicable to PEM fuel cells was proposed, \ncompared to other models from the literature and a few simpler \nfundamental problems were solved.  \n\n \nKeywords: PEM fuel cells, mass transport, Maxwell-Stefan, \nElectrochemistry, Energy conversion.  \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L.

Over the years, humanity has developed different \nalternatives for transport, storage and utilization of energy. Initially, \nwood and coal were used as energy sources. The advances in the natural \nsciences in the late 17th century allowed the design and construction of \nsteam machines by Papin (1647-1712) and Savery (1650 - 1715). In the \n18th century the industrial revolution provided a sudden impulse in the \nenergy evolution with significant social consequences. But it was only \nin the late 19th century that the great age of energy development \noccurred with the wide control of the petroleum and electrical energy \nindustries. In spite of the relatively short period of time (last 60 years \napproximately) in which petroleum and its derivate have been the main \nfuel source, a critical point in environment, energy delivery and social \ncontext has been reached. In the environmental scenario, continuous and \nmassive emission of pollutants to the atmosphere has changed the \ndelicate natural equilibrium with potential devastating consequences for \nlife around the world. In the energy area, it is very likely that petroleum \nhas reached its peak of production around 2005. The remaining \npetroleum reserves are harder to reach, the total reserves are declining \nfast, new discoveries have diminished and, in the long run, there is a \nclear tendency of scarcity of sources and elevation of prices. The \npolitical and economic issues that have followed the petroleum peak \nproduction have sparked the newest and intensive large scale research in \nalternative energies. The developments in alternative energy sources, \nmostly in the OECD nations, have increase vastly during the last years \nstimulated mainly by economic and strategic interests, i.e., nations \nseeking energy independency and intending to become major players in \nthe technological markets, and, to a lesser extent, by the official \nenvironmental constraints imposed internally by the environmental \nagencies of individual nations. \n\nThe Brazilian energy scenario, as it stands in 2012, has some \nparticular features when compared to the OCDE nations. The first is the \nrelatively high participation of renewables, mostly in the electrical \nenergy and industrial sectors. Second, there is a relatively high amount \nof electrical energy losses. The following data was extracted from the \nBrazilian National Energy Assessment (BEN, 2012) and from the \nGlobal Energy Statistical Yearbook (ENERDATA, 2012).  \n\n\n\n36 \n\nThe Brazilian total energy consumption for the year 2011 was \n272.2 Mtoe, corresponding to 2.06% of the world energy consumption. \nThe participation of energy from renewable sources in the energy matrix \nin Brazil stands among the highest in the world. While the world \naverage participation of renewables in the energy mix was 13% in 2011, \nin Brazil it reached 44%, which included hydropower (14.7%), \nsugarcane biomass (15.7%), other biomass (9.7 %) and other renewable \nsources (4.1%). When observing the consumer side, the industries \naccount for 35.9% (of this total, 20.1% are in the form of renewable \nenergy and 15.8% as non-renewable energy), transport for 30.1% (5.1% \nrenewable), residential for 9.5% (6.5% renewable), the energy sector for \n8.9%, the agricultural sector for 4.0%, and the services sector for 4.4%. \nNoteworthy is the fact that electricity has a participation of 18.1%, while \nthe remaining 81.9% is used as thermal energy.  \n\nThe total electricity supply (both domestic and imported) for \n2011 was 568.8 TWh. Consumption accounted for 481.3 TWh, while \nthe remaining 15.4% of losses are attributed to business and technical \nfactors. This electrical energy supply is mostly renewable. While the \nglobal average of the participation of renewable sources in the electrical \nenergy matrix was 20.1% in 2011, the Brazilian average stood at 88.8%, \nwith an increase of 2.5% when compared to 2010. This participation \noriginates mainly from two sources, the hydroelectricity (467.0 TWh) \nand the sugarcane biomass (37.2 TWh). Other renewable sources have a \nsmaller contribution, but have experienced a fast growth. As an \nexample, the electricity from wind presented a 75.8% growth between \n2009 and 2010, reaching 928 MW of installed capacity producing \n2176.6 GWh. Because of the large distances and the different regional \nneeds in Brazil, diversification and decentralization of the energy matrix \nare strategic goals to be pursued in the next years.  \n\nFrom the alternative energy sources and conversion devices, fuel \ncells appear as a promising long term option. The principle of operation \nwas described in 1839 and the first fuel cell was developed in 1845. \nHowever, the research in fuel cell technology only begun in the second \nhalf of the last century by the aeronautics and space agency of the \nUnited States (NASA). Then, other institutes continued this line of \nresearch mostly in the private sector. Nevertheless, important advances \nin research on hydrogen and fuel cells have been developed in institutes \nand universities around the word, and significant open literature is \navailable. \n\nIn response to the needs of developing the fuel cell science and \ntechnology, Brazil made the strategic decision to develop a hydrogen \n\n\n\n37 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\neconomy that would introduce hydrogen in the energy matrix by 2020. \nBasic research in fuel cells in Brazil started early (TICIANELLI et al., \n1989; WENDT, GOTZ, and LINARDI, 2000). But only in 2002 \ngovernment initiatives were formalized through the \u201cMinist\u00e9rio de \nCi\u00eancia e Tecnologia\u201d and \u201cMinist\u00e9rio de Minas e Energia\u201d to introduce \nthe Brazilian Program of Hydrogen and Fuel Cell System- ProCaC.  In \n2005 this program was reformulated and called Program of Science, \nTechnology and Innovation to the Hydrogen Economy \u2013 ProH2. This \nprogram focused on hydrogen production and fuel cell development. \nNetworks of public, private institutions and companies have been since \nworking towards common objectives.  \n\nThe present work follows previous efforts at UFSC on hydrogen \nand polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells (MATELLI, 2001; \nSTEIDEL 2005; ACEVEDO, 2006; PI\u00d1A, 2006; SILVA, 2010; \nNUNES, 2011, MARI\u00d1O, 2011) and looks at detailed analysis of the \nPEM fuel cell and its operation. Here, a comprehensive analysis of the \nthermodynamic, electrochemistry and mass transport to develop a \ntheoretical model for a PEM fuel cell is proposed. The modeling \naddresses the different reaction and mass transfer phenomena that take \nplace within a fuel cell. A major requirement for the PEM fuel cell \noperation is to keep the polymer humid during operation. Water is \nlocally generated on the cathode side and this water migrates to the \ncathode gas and also across the polymer. Alternatively, the anode gas \ncan also be humidified, providing extra water vapor on the anode side. \nThe understanding of the phenomena that occurs within the fuel cell \nprovides a way to understand the water and heat management of the \nsystem allowing for system optimization and enhancement of the fuel \ncell life. \n\nOBJECTIVES \nThe main objective of the present thesis is to develop a theory for \n\nmass transport in a PEM fuel cell from a phenomenological analysis \nbased on the fundamentals of the multicomponent, multiphase mass \ntransport in porous media. The model aims at predicting the electric and \nmass transport behaviors with a formulation suitable for solution with \ncurrent computational resources. To this end, specific objectives are: \n\n1. To investigate the characteristic length scales of the different \ncomponents and phenomena within the fuel cell as a base for criteria to \ndefine the needs of simulation. \n\n2. To review and organize the vast amount of information about \nPEM fuel cell theory, modeling and simulation.  \n\n\n\n38 \n\n3. To review the relations between thermodynamic, electric and \nelectrochemical processes in a PEM fuel cell. \n\n4. To measure the polarization curve for a fuel cell system with \nthe purpose of identifying the controlling transport and chemical \nphenomena, assess the applicability of the available lumped models and \nto determine the orders of magnitude of global parameters characteristic \nof the fuel cell operation.  \n\n5. To review the fundamental continuum and thermodynamic \ntheories of mass and charge transport in two-phase, multicomponent \nflow in porous media.  \n\n6. To develop a phenomenological model for mass and charge \ntransfer applicable to PEM fuel cells from the fundamental continuum \nand thermodynamic theories for flow and mass transfer in porous media.  \n\nCONTRIBUTION \nThe available state-of-the-art models usually either develop \n\noverall lumped-component models using simpler semi-empirical \nequations for the components or blend different point-wise detailed \nmodels into a single simulation tool. More rarely the models focus on \nspecific behavior of fuel cell components on an attempt to better \nunderstand the role of micro and nano phenomena on the macroscopic \noutput. The major difficulty in using the detailed models and \ninterpreting their results is that the large superposition and interrelation \nof different modeling principles, sometimes with conflicting \nrequirements, like a patchwork, produces a very rich macroscopic \npicture with sometimes faulty local features. \n\nAs an example, consider the current models that blend CFD type \nmodels (Navier-Stokes, energy and conservation of mass) for the \nchannel, extended forms of Darcy\u2019s and Fick\u00b4s laws for flow and mass \ndiffusion across the GDL, the Focker-Planck equation for ionic transport \nacross the MEA and empirical equilibrium relations and transport \ncoefficients. Since the MEA forms a single diffusion media, why is \nthere a change in framework, from Fick\u2019s law to Focker-Planck when \none proceeds from the GDL to the membrane, requiring different \nsolution methodologies and understanding for the local properties? \n\nThis patchwork is understandable since the fuel cell modeling \ngrew linking traditional models from the CFD, porous media, membrane \nand electrochemistry communities into single usable algorithms. These \nmodels provided the basic footwork for fuel cell and stack \ndevelopments, being now available commercially, for example, with \nFLUENT\u00ae and COMSOL\u00ae, but have reached some limitations. These \n\n\n\n39 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nlimitations rest on the detailed models themselves that need now to be \nimproved to allow for the future developments. \n\nIn this work, we propose to return to the basics and look again the \nfundamentals continuum models applicable for modeling mass transport \nin fuel cell\u2019s MEA. From the basic description an integrated liquid, gas \nand species mass transport model is proposed and applied. The model \nwill be used in future work to critically assess the importance of the \ndifferent chemical and transport phenomena, pointing to the need for \ndetailed molecular modeling and to the possibilities of design and \noperation of fuel cells. \n\nSTRUCTURE OF THE DOCUMENT \nThis document is divided into 3 parts. The first part includes \n\nchapters 2 to 4 and describes the thermal and electrochemical \ncharacteristics of PEM fuel cells, the measurement of the polarization \ncurve and the modeling using lumped models. The second part includes \nchapters 5 and 6 and presents the basic continuum mechanics and \nthermodynamic theories for the transport in multicomponent mixtures. \nFinally, the third part comprises the remaining chapters and develops the \nfundamental theories for heat and mass transfer in fuel cells, with \nemphasis in the modeling of the membrane and porous layers.  \n\nThe chapters cover the following contents.  \nChapter 2 presents the fundamentals of PEM fuel cells. It \n\npresents a detailed description of the fuel cell components and the origin \nof the fuel cell operation voltages. Description of the components \ninvolves features as material, geometry and length scales, which are \nrelevant to model development and numerical simulations. The \npresentation of the factors affecting the fuel cell voltage requires a \ndescription of the potential of working cells as well as a description of \nthe polarization curves. A review of the models for PEM fuel cells is \npresented. First, there is a discussion about the complexities involved in \nthe models, that is then followed by an attempt of a general \nclassification of the available modeling efforts. Later, a chronological \ndescription of theoretical fundamental models since the pioneering \nworks of Bernardi and Verbrugge (1991 and 1992) and Springer et al. \n(1991 and 1993); to present 3D CFD models is presented.  \n\nChapter 3 presents the measurement of the polarization curve of a \n200 W fuel cell stack. The values of current and overvoltage are \ndetermined for the activation and ohmic regimes for different operation \ntemperatures using saturated hydrogen and oxygen.  \n\nChapter 4 presents the application of a lumped-component model \nand the estimation of the basic macroscopic characteristic of the fuel cell \n\n\n\n40 \n\nused in Chapter 3. Special emphasis is devoted to the treatment of the \nmass transfer limitations, using two different mass transfer models, \nvalidated against other measurements available in the literature. This \nchapter identifies operation features and magnitudes of fluxes and global \ntransport parameters. It also points to the need of detailed modeling. \n\nChapter 5 reviews the modeling of flow with multicomponent \ndiffusion. The basic conservation equations for mass, linear momentum, \nenergy and entropy are presented and discussed within the frameworks \nof continuum mechanics and thermodynamics of irreversible processes. \nThe constitutive relation for the mass transfer is then developed, within \nthe classic framework of the Maxwell-Stefan treatment. \n\nChapter 6 presents a critique of these models and isolates a model \nfor the driving force for mass diffusion with a minimum of limiting \nassumptions.  \n\nChapter 7 reviews the modeling of mass transport in porous \nmedia, with emphasis to multicomponent mass transfer in two-phase \nflow. In this chapter different approaches based on volume-averaging \nand general Maxwell-Stefan formulation are critically revised. \n\nChapter 8 presents a general homogeneous one component model \nfor multicomponent two-phase flow in porous media under the limits of \nlow Reynolds and low Peclet number flows. The model is compared to \nalternatives from the literature and applied to simpler mass diffusion \nproblems in order to elucidate the role of the bulk convective flow and \npressure gradient.  \n\nChapter 9 presents conclusions and recommendations for future \nwork.  \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\nPart I \n \n\nProton exchange fuel cell (PEMFC): Description \nand semi-empirical modeling \n\n \nThe main objectives of this first part are to describe the thermal \n\nand electrochemical characteristics of PEM fuel cells, the measurement \nof the polarization curve and the modeling using lumped models. Both \nthe measurement and modeling are applied to a specific 200 W PEM \nfuel cell stack operating under steady-state conditions with pure \nhydrogen and oxygen.  \n\nInitially, in chapter 2, the different components forming a typical \nPEM fuel cell are described, with special attention to the Nafion\u00ae \nstructure, water and ion transport. The thermodynamic and \nelectrochemical phenomena that are in the origin of the electrical \npotential are then presented following the classical approaches.  \n\nIn chapter 3, a specific 200 W PEM fuel cell stack and the \napparatus used to measure the polarization curve are presented. The \nmeasurements are done following traditional methodologies. In chapter \n4, a set of lumped semi-empirical equations is applied to describe the \nmeasured polarization curve. The important macroscopic parameters are \nobtained from a curve fitting procedure and are compared to values from \nthe literature. Special emphasis is devoted to the mass transfer \nlimitation, modeled using two different mass transfer models, as a \nmotivation for part II of this work.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n43 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L.

Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\n2 FUNDAMENTALS OF PEM FUEL CELLS \n\nA fuel cell is an electrochemical device that continuously \nconverts chemical energy into electrical energy (and heat) as long as \nfuel and oxidant are supplied (HOOGERS, 2003). Fuel cells are today \none of the most efficient electrical energy generation devices and are \nadapted to the current environmental and sustainable requirements for \nthe electrical energy generation. They are one of the core components in \na hydrogen-based energy economy (YANG and PITCHUMANI, 2006). \nBesides the environmental advantages, fuel cells have a high energy \nconversion efficiency, low pollution, and no dependency on depleting \nfossil resources (YANG and PITCHUMANI, 2006) when compared to \nother means of generation of electricity from fuel such as internal \ncombustion engines and thermoelectric devices. Thermodynamically, \nwhen comparing fuel cells with heat engines, the most striking \ndifference is that the latter are limited by the Carnot efficiency while \nfuel cells are not (HOOGERS, 2003). In addition, depending on their \noperation temperature, their exhaust gas can be used for cogeneration. \nThey are also compact, noiseless, and provide a continuous and high \nquality reliable current. A general structure of a single cell is composed \nof two electrodes separated by an electrolyte. All fuel cells work with \nthe same basic principle: at the anode a fuel, such as hydrogen, is \noxidized into electrons and cations, while at the cathode, an oxidizer, \nsuch as oxygen, is reduced to oxide species. Depending on the \nelectrolyte, either protons or oxide ions are transported through the ion-\nconducting, but electronically insulating, electrolyte, to combine with \noxide or protons to generate products, electric power and heat. The most \ncommon way to classify the fuel cell is according to the nature of the \nelectrolyte, as shown in Table 1. There are also differences in the \noperation temperatures, type of fuel and ions that cross the electrolyte. \n\nTable 1 - A few fuel cells classified by the electrolyte material \nInitial Fuel cell type Operating temperature \n\nPEMFC \nProton Exchange Membrane FC or \nPolymer Electrolyte Membrane FC \n\n30 \u2013 100oC \n\nAFC Alkaline Fuel Cell 50 \u2013 200 oC \nSOFC Solid Oxide Fuel Cell 750 \u2013 1000 oC \nMCFC Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell ~ 650 oC \nPAFC Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell ~ 220 oC \nDMFC Direct Methanol Fuel Cell 20 \u2013 90 oC \n\nSources: U.S.A, 2006; Larminie and Dicks, 2003. \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \nProton Exchange or Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells \n\n(PEM fuel cell) stands out because of their simplicity and high power \ndensity, which makes them the choice for compact stationary electrical \ngeneration systems and mobile applications. PEM fuel cells can achieve \nefficiencies as high as 50% even for small size units (1 to 5 kW). They \ntake their name from the polymeric membrane used as the electrolyte. \nHistorically, they were also called the Solid Polymer Electrolyte Fuel \nCell (SPEFC) and the first operational products were developed by \nGeneral Electric in The United States in the 1960\u2019s for use by NASA. \nThe polymer electrolyte works at low temperatures, which has the \nadvantage of quickly starting. Because of the thinness of the membrane \nelectrode assemblies (MEA) compact fuel cells can be made. Further \nadvantages are that there are no corrosive fluid hazards and that the cell \ncan work in any orientation. However, at the time of the Apollo \nprogram, the problem of water management in the cell was judged too \ndifficult to overcome reliably and NASA ended up selecting the alkaline \nfuel cell in its Apollo vehicles. The developments over recent years have \nbrought the current densities up to around 1 A/cm2 or more in the best \nconditions, while at the same time reducing the use of platinum by a \nfactor of over 100 compared with the first General Electrical fuel cell \nmodels. It could be argued that PEM fuel cells exceed all other electrical \nenergy generating technologies with respect to the scope of their \npossible applications. They are a possible power source of a few watts \nfor powering mobile phones and other electronic equipment such as \ncomputers, right through to a few kilowatts for boats and domestic \nsystems, to tens of kilowatts for cars, to hundreds of kilowatts for buses \nand industrial CHP systems (LARMINIE and DICKS, 2003). \n\nAmong the most interesting challenges on low-temperature fuel \ncell research are the poisoning of the membrane by the effects of CO, \nthe improvement of the biological route for hydrogen production, the \ndirect electricity generation by microbes and the alcohol fuel cells.  \n\nBy overcoming the CO poisoning of the MEA, a wide range of \nfuels originating from thermochemical, such as gasification, or \nbiological, such as anaerobic digestion, processes will become available \nfor use in PEM fuel cells. (RESHETENKO, BETHUNE, and \nROCHELEAU 2012) \n\nThe improvement of biological routes for obtaining hydrogen and \ndirectly as biological fuel cells has significant advantages as an energy \nconversion process since they operate at ambient condition (low \ntemperature and pressure), avoid the post treatment of the effluent, do \n\n\n\n45 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nnot transport or consume significant amounts of energy and use residual \nsources as wastewater and glycerol, the byproduct of the catalytic \ntransesterification of bio-oil to biodiesel (BICAKOVA e STRAKA, \n2012). Among the biological processes for energy generation, the \nmicrobial fuel cells (MFCs) show a promising future. MFCs are not a \nnew technology, since they are known from the early 70s, but only \nrecently this technology has been developed to the point of producing \nnet power, providing possible opportunities for practical applications \n(RABEY and VERSTRAETE, 2005).  \n\nThe direct alcohol systems, for example, the DMFC and DEFC \nconverting methanol and ethanol, respectively, are more compact when \ncompared to PEMFC because they do not require the presence of heavy \nand bulky external fuel reformers and can be applied especially for the \ngeneration of electric power in mobile and stationary applications. All \nthese issues have encouraged scientists and researchers to directly use \nliquid fuels to power fuel cells, leaving aside the difficulties and the \ndangers associated with handling, storage, transport and distribution of \nreactant gases such as hydrogen (SONG et al., 2006). \n\n \n\n2.1 DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTION OF COMPONENTS \n\nA unit fuel cell is composed of three main sections: end plates, \nflow field plates and the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). End \nplates are two external plates that act as structural support for the fuel \ncell and can also act as total current collectors (in the case of having a \ncurrent conductor side). Even when many individual fuel cells are \nstacked in a single fuel cell system, the amount of end plates remains the \nsame, two. The number of flow field plates however increases with the \namount of individual fuel cells, one for each new one. Flow field plates \nare generally made of graphite composites and among other functions \nthey distribute the reactants to the surface of the MEA. When stacked, \neach individual cell is separated by at least one flow field plate. \nGenerally, channels are etched in both sides of the internal flow field \nplates giving them dual function, as an anode plate on one side and \ncathode on the other (bipolar plates).  \n\n\n\n46 \n\nFigure 1 -A schematic description of the components of a PEM fuel cell. \n\nMEA consists of two porous electrodes separated by the \nelectrolyte, an ion conducting membrane (PEM design). Each electrode \nis composed of two layers, a thin catalyst layer adhered to an electrically \nconductive porous substrate or gas diffuser layer GDL. The electrolyte, \ncommonly called membrane, is a proton exchange, electrical insulator, \ngas impermeable polymeric membrane. Figure 1 is a rendering of a \nhydrogen-oxygen PEM fuel cell showing the different components and \ntheir location inside a unit hydrogen-oxygen PEM fuel cell in cross \nsection. \n\nThe operation of the cell, can be explained as follows. When \narriving to the fuel cell stack, hydrogen enters by the channel etched on \nthe flow field plate of the anode side, diffuses across the GDL and \nreaches the anode catalyst layer. The correct spreading of the hydrogen \nespecially onto the catalytic area underneath the support ribs of the flow \nfield plate is one of the most important functions of the GDL. On the \ncatalyst layer, hydrogen splits into protons and electrons. Protons \ncontinue the path in the same direction crossing the polymeric \nmembrane, either as hydronium molecules or as free cations, reaching \nthe cathode catalyst layer. Several transport mechanisms can be present \nin the proton\u00b4s transport. In most theoretical models they are all \nsummarized on the drag coefficients. On the other hand and due to the \n\n\n\n47 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nnon-electrical conductor properties of the electrolyte, electrons are \nobliged to make an external path through the GDL and ultimately to the \nelectric terminals of the fuel cell stack. Figure 2 shows a rendering of \nthe different fluxes present when a fuel cell is working: The flux of \nelectrons (orange), hydrogen gas and hydrogen cations (light green), \noxygen (pink), water (light blue) and heat (orange arrow). \n\n \nFigure 2 \u2013 Rendering of the different fluxes in an operating fuel cell.  \n\n \n\n \n \nAfter passing through the load and delivering the energy, \n\nelectrons enter by the end plates, the flow field plates and the GDL of \nthe cathode to reach the cathode catalyst layer. The oxidant, O2, coming \nfrom the cathode flow field plate channel diffuses through the gas \ndiffusing layer and also reaches the cathode catalyst layer to react with \nprotons and electrons in an exothermal reaction. In this case, water and \nheat are the only products. The generated heat is conducted back \nthrough the GDLs and flow field plates which form a link with the \nadjacent cells, cooling plates or end collector plates, finally reaching the \nexternal ambient.  \n\n\n\n48 \n\nWater has a more complicated path inside the fuel cell due to its \nfunction in the ionic transport process. In general, hydrogen must be \nhumidified before entering the fuel cell. The polymeric membrane needs \na minimum level of hydration in order to be able to conduct protons. \nThat\u2019s because the proton conduction process relies on using the water \nchannels as routes. This transport of protons produces an additional \nwater flux from the anode to the cathode, which, depending on the \nelectrical current delivered, could be greater than the water flux due to \nthe concentration gradient that acts in the opposite direction. Efficient \nwater management inside the fuel cell is necessary in order to guarantee \na uniform water uptake in the membrane. \n\nThe dimensions of the components of typical fuel cells span \nmany orders of magnitude, from the macro-scale, corresponding to the \nglobal cell and channel dimensions (height, width, thickness), passing \nthrough the micro-scale, corresponding to the thickness and pore \ndiameters of the GDL, finally reaching the nano-scale that corresponds \nto the pore in the membrane and the catalyst crystallites. Table 2 \npresents a comparison of the order of magnitudes of the dimensions of \nthe different components of the fuel cell. \n\nFigure 3 presents a detailed rendering of the different layers \nshowing the structure, materials and chemical species within them and \nthe ideal transport processes that occur when the cell is operated. Some \ndimensions within the fuel cell can also be observed. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E.

Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nIn the following, each component is analyzed separately. \n\n2.1.1 End plates \n\nThe end plates of fuel cell assemblies are used to fasten the inner \nstack, as shown in Figure 4. The most important requisite for end plates \nis that they must be rigid throughout their length and height, so that they \ncan provide even pressure over the MEA\u00b4s surface, (HURLEY, 2002). \nThey also, reduce the contact resistance and provide a seal on the MEA. \nEnd plates therefore require sufficient mechanical strength to withstand \nthe tightening pressure, small weight, and stable \nchemical/electrochemical properties, as well as providing electrical \ninsulation. Since end plates should not deform under operating \ntemperature, pressure and moisture conditions, they must have a certain \ndegree of mechanical strength and stiffness (KIM et al, 2008). End \nplates were typically made from metals such as aluminum, titanium, and \nstainless steel alloys, but due to corrosion, heat losses, and their \nexcessive weight, alternative material such as plastics have been \nconsidered. Composite materials consisting of combinations of metals \nand polymers have also been proposed for end plates to enhance their \nmechanical strength. Also, end plates can be used as total current \ncollectors. In this case, a gold or copper thin coating can provide a \nconductive surface that connects with a graphite foil plate and conveys \nthe electricity to the binding posts. Kim et al (2008) presents a review \non end plates with a complete classification where three design criteria \nfor end plates are considered: materials, connecting methods and shape. \n\nFigure 4 - End plate localization inside the fuel cell (KIM, 2008). \n\n \n \n\n\n\n52 \n\n2.1.2 Bipolar plates \n\nBipolar collector/separator plates are plates that make a physical \nlimit and electrical connection between each unit cell (Figure 4) when \nthey are organized in a stack structure. They have a strong effect on the \narchitecture, mass, volume and mechanical strength of the total stack \n(GRANIER et al., 2004). Bipolar plates must provide electric \nconnection between two adjacent MEAs, adequate even gas distribution \non the catalyst layer and also help with water (removal) and heat \nmanagement in the overall cell. All these functions determine their \nrequired properties namely (BARBIR, 2006): high electrical \nconductivity for connect cells electrically in series; impermeability to \nreactant gases since they must separate the gases in adjacent cells; to \nhave adequate mechanical strength and be lightweight due to the \nnecessity to provide structural support for the stack; good thermal \nconductivity owing to their need to conduct heat from active cells to the \ncooling cells; to hold conformable properties since typically they house \nthe flow-field channels; stability and corrosion resistance inasmuch as \nthe corrosive environment inside the fuel cell. In addition, the material \nmust be affordable and easy to machine, and the manufacturing process \nmust be suitable for mass production. \n\nCommonly two kinds of material have been used for PEM fuel \ncell bipolar plates, namely graphite-composite and metallic. Metals \n(steel, titanium nickel) have desirable characteristic like high electronic \nand thermal conductivity and exhibit excellent mechanical properties, \nnevertheless they are less desirables causes due to the difficulty and cost \nof machining and their limited corrosion resistances. Due to the very \ncorrosive environment (pH 2-3 and temperature 60\u00b0- 80\u00b0 C) they are \nexposed to inside fuel cell, they would corrode and dissolved metal ions \ntoward the membrane reducing its ion conductivity. Corrosion layer also \nwould increase electrical resistance. As a solution for the later trouble, \nmetallic bipolar plates must be adequately coated with a non-corrosive \nyet electrically conductive layer (graphite, diamond-like carbon, \nconductive polymer, organic self-assembled polymer, noble metals, \nmetal nitride, metal carbides, indium doped tin oxide etc.) (BARBIR, \n2006). Graphite based materials are a good option because among other \nfeatures they are low cost and chemically resistant. Some techniques \ninclude development of plates based on graphite foil, which can be cut, \nmolded, or carved in relief in order to generate a flow field pattern. \nAnother cost-effective volume production technique is injection or \ncompression molding (HOOGERS, 2003). Common carbon composite \n\n\n\n53 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nmaterials used are thermoplastics (polypro-pylene, polyethylene, or \npolyvinylidenefluoride) or thermoset resins (phenolic, epoxies and vinyl \nesters) with fillers (such as carbon/graphite powder, carbon black or \ncoke-graphite) and with or without fiber reinforcements. They are \ntypically chemically stable in fuel cell environments, and could be \nsuitable for compression, transfer or injection molding. \n\nOne of the most important functions of bipolar plates is the \nelectrical conduction. Values in the range of 50,000 to 200,000 S/m are \ntypically found for bulk electrical conductivity of graphite-composite \nbipolar plates. Despite the lower values when compared with pure \ngraphite and metallic plates, they are sufficient for the function in the \ncell. The most significant difficulties today are the fuel cell stack contact \n(interfacial) resistance and one of interesting research topic nowadays in \nthe fuel cell area. \n\nBipolar plates also have the function of flow field plates for \nsupplying the reactant gas from the inlet to the GDL, and as a structural \nsupport for the MEA. They must be several millimeters thick, mainly to \ngive them mechanical strength and allow the engraving of flow \nchannels. As a flow field, channels are etched into the side of the plate \nnext to the GDL. Channels can exist on either side of the flow field plate \nsuch that it forms the cathode plate on one side and the anode plate on \nthe other side, where the term bipolar plate is taken. The form and \ndimensions of the channel have strong influence on distribution of the \nreactant on the catalyst. Flow field design also affects water supply to \nthe membrane and water removal from the cathode (HOOGERS, 2003). \nThe Channel is typically rectangular in cross-section; however other \nconfigurations have been studied (LI and SABIR, 2005) such as \ntrapezoidal, triangular, and semi-circular. The Channel width and depth \nare between 1 and 2 mm, less than 1 mm is not recommended. Product \nwater removal at the cathode is even more complex as this represents a \ntwo-phase flow problem. Parallel channels can lower the pressure \ndifferential between the gas inlet and outlet but cannot avoid the droplet \nformation in the channel. Droplets tend to coalesce and form larger \ndroplets partially obstructing the channel. The reactant flux will be \nredistributed and some part of the membrane will not receive a reactant \nbecoming inactive (HONTA\u00d1\u00d3N et al., 2000). \n\nOptimum equilibrium between dimensions of open area (channel) \nand contact area (landing ribs) is necessary. Open area is used to supply \nthe reactant while contact area is used for current conduction. The size \nof the open structure depends on the resistivity of the material used, the \nsize of the MEA, the operating pressure and the current range envisaged. \n\n\n\n54 \n\nA solid blank sheet is the best electrical conductor, which does not allow \nany gas access, while an entirely open structure, convenient for good \nreactant distribution, does not allow any current to flow. The task of \nachieving the right structure can be done by fluid-dynamic modeling in \ncombination with experimental evaluation of a large number of different \ndesigns. Some studies have determined that porous material plates \ninstead of grooved flow field plates, show better performance \n(HONTA\u00d1\u00d3N et al., 2000). \n\nSince bipolar plates constitute more than 60% of the weight and \n30% of the total cost in a fuel cell stack, several configuration have been \nproposed (see Figure 5). Amongst all of the characteristics, the \nclassification based on channel shape is one of the preferred ones. \n\nFigure 5 - Flow field designs. a) Pin-type, b) straight and parallel \nchannel, c) single serpentine, d) interdigitated (LI and SABIR, 2005) \n\n \n \n\n\n\n55 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nThe typical designs are; pin-type, series-parallel, serpentine, \nintegrated and interdigitated flow field. Interdigitated channels force the \nflow through the GDL from one channel to the other. Li and Sabir \n(2005) presents a description of all these types of bipolar plates, while \nArato et al. (2006b) evaluated their advantages when compared to the \nserpentine flow field.  \n\n2.1.3 Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) \n\nMEA is the unit responsible for the most important function in \nthe fuel cell, the electrochemical reaction and the protons and electrons \ntransport, whit the consequent electrical current generation. MEA \nconsists of two gas diffusion electrodes, formed by a baking layer or \nsubstrate (commonly known as GDL) with a thin layer catalytic, and \nseparated by the polymeric membrane (ion conducting membrane). The \nGDL are porous materials generally made of carbon cloth or paper, \ncatalytic layer is platinum supported on carbon suspense in a polymeric \nmatrix intimately glued to the electrolyte membrane, and the membrane \nis a solid polymer electrolyte. Table 3 summarizes the roles of the \ncomponents of the MEA. \n\nTable 3 - Characteristic MEA components and their roles (Source: \nHOOGERS, 2003). \n\nMEA component Role / Effect \n\nAnode GDL \n\nFuel supply and distribution (hydrogen/gas fuel) \nElectron conduction \nHeat removal from reaction zone \nWater supply (vapor) into electro-catalyst \n\nAnode Catalyst layer \n\nCatalyst of anode reaction \nProton conduction into membrane \nWater transport \nHeat transport \n\nProton exchange \nMembrane \n\nProton conduction \nWater transport \nElectronic  and reactant insulation \n\nCathode catalyst layer \n\nCatalysis of cathode reaction \nOxygen transport to reaction sites \nProton conduction from  membrane to reaction sites \nElectron conduction from GDL to reaction sites \nWater removal from reactive zone into substrate \nHeat generation/removal \n\nCathode GDL \n\nOxidant supply and distribution (air/ oxygen) \nElectron conduction toward reaction zone \nHeat removal \nWater transport (liquid/water) \n\n\n\n56 \n\nThe electrodes are a complex structure of open gas pores, proton \nconducting ionomer and catalyst on highly porous carbon supports that \nserve as the electron conducting phase. The catalyst layer on either side \nof the membrane contains the necessary amount of electro-catalyst to \nallow the electrochemical reaction in the cell operating temperature. \nMembrane serves as an ion conductor and a species barrier, \nimpermeable, as much as possible for the reactants and electrons. \n\n2.1.3.1 Membranes  \n\nThe main function of the membrane is the proton transport in wet \ncondition, but also serves as electron insulator and gas barrier between \nthe two electrodes (HOOGERS, 2003). PEM fuel cells were initially \ndeveloped by General Electric around the middle of the 1960\u00b4s, but the \nmembranes short durability was only solved in the late 1960\u00b4s when the \nE. I. DuPont Company developed Nafion\u00ae, a perfluorinated sulfonic \nacid membrane, developed from polymerized tetrafluoroethylene \n(DuPont trade name Teflon\u00ae). \n\nNafion\u00ae works as a cation selective membrane. These \nmembranes are, in general, made of a cross-linked polymeric network in \nwhich functional active groups are fixed. The active groups may be \ncarboxylic \u2013(CO2)\n\n- sulfonic \u2013(SO3)\n- and other organic radicals. Beyond \n\nNafion, other examples of proton conducting membranes are \npolysulfone (PS), polybenzimidazole (PBI) and polyetheretherketone \n(PEK, PEEKK and PEEK) (ALBERTI and CASCIOLA, 2001; JESUS, \n2005; K\u00c4FER, 2010; FIMRITE, J. A. 2002.). Besides the application in \nPEM fuel cells, Nafion is also used for Cl2 production via chlor-alkali \ncells (VAN der STEGGEN et al., 1999a).  \n\nNafion is produced by copolymerization of a perfluorinated vinyl \nether (4-methyl-3,6 \u2013dioxa-7-octene-1-sulfoyl fluoride) co-monomer \nwith tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) (MAURITZ and MOORE, 2004), \nresulting in long chains formed by repetition (100 to 1000 times) of a \nunit of monomer. Figure 6 shows a representation of a unit of monomer. \nOne molecular chain can contain between 100 to 1000 units.  \n\n\n\n57 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nFigure 6 - Representation of the molecular unit of the Nafion\u00ae chain. \n(MAURITZ AND MOORE, 2004). \n\n \nStructurally, Nafion\u00ae is formed by hydrophobic \n\npolytetrafluoroethhylene (PTFE) long backbone chain with regular \nspaced perfluorinated vinyl ether pendant chains each terminated by a \nstrongly hydrophilic sulfonated ionic group  \u2013(SO3)\n\n- (HAUBOLD, et al., \n2001). The total amount of these pendant chains add up to at most 10% \nin moles of the whole polymer (HEITNER-WIRGUIN, 1996). The ratio \nx/y = m, shown in Figure 6, gives the average frequency of TFE-\nmonomers into the unit and has a value between 5 and 13 (WENDT, \nGOTZ, and LINARDI, 2000) with average value around 6,5 (JANG et \nal., 2004). The number of O-CF2-CF units within the co-monomer, z, \nusually has value of the unit (z=1) for Nafion\u00ae (SOUZY and \nAMEDURI, 2005). The equivalent weight EW is the mass in grams of \ndry Nafion per mole of sulfonic acid groups when the material is in the \nacid form. This is an averaged value related to m by EW = 100m + 446. \nThe Nafion\u00ae membrane is identified by the value of EW divided by 100 \nfollowed by a digit that refers to the thickness of the membrane in mil \n(1mil = 0.001 inch = 0.0254 mm) (FIMRITE, J. A., 2002). For example, \nNafion 117 is a 1100 EW (EW = 1100 g/mol) Nafion membrane with \nthickness 7 mil (0.007 in, ~ 0.1715 mm). On average, this membrane \nhas 14 CF2 groups (m = 7) separating adjacent side chains. The ion \nexchange capacity IEC = 1000/EW is commonly used to identify ion-\nexchange membranes (MAURITZ and MOORE, 2004).  \n\nWhen hydrated, the water molecules within Nafion\u00ae cluster \naround the sulfonic groups. The PTFE regions are hydrophobic, while \nthe \u2013(SO3)\n\n- regions are hydrophilic, i.e., Nafion\u00ae presents a \nnanosegregated structure (JANG et al., 2004). Intermediate phases may \nexist between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic phases (YEAGER and \nSTECK, 1981). Essentially, water is confined to form proton conducting \nchannels and the sulfonic groups form the hydrophilic surfaces. The \npolymer chains, supporting the sulfonic groups, form the hydrophobic \nregions and provide flexibility to the membrane. Results from small \n\n\n\n58 \n\nangle X-ray scattering (SAXS) combined to MD simulation indicate the \npresence of about 10 vol% Nafion\u00ae crystallites in the form of long rods \nparallel to the water channels embedded in the amorphous PTFE matrix \n(SCHMIDT-ROHR and CHEN, 2007, SCHMIDT-ROHR and CHEN, \n2008a). These crystallites provide much of the membrane mechanical \nstrength acting as physical crosslink preventing a complete dissolution \nat moderate temperatures (INZELT et al., 2000). The topology of the \nhydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces creates size-dependent, \nwettability and long-range electrostatic effects and also a percolation \nthreshold for ionic charge motion.   \n\nIn order to develop an appropriate understanding of the behavior \nof hydrated Nafion\u00ae as a proton conducting membrane, the molecular \nand matrix structures and their interaction with water molecules must be \ndescribed. This conceptual and quantitative description has been \nobtained by the combined use of observation, measurement and \nmodeling techniques. Figure 7 presents the characterization of a \nNafion\u00ae membrane at progressively smaller scales using various \ntechniques.  In the figure, (a) Optical photograph of the Nafion\u00ae \nmembrane revealing details at the centimeter scale; (b) Membrane \nsurface observed with atomic force microscope, revealing surface \nfeatures as molecular roughness.

Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nFigure 7 - Characterization of a Nafion\u00ae membrane at progressively smaller \nscales using various techniques. (From: DIAT and GEBEL, 2008) \n\n \nDynamic observation techniques include quasi-elastic neutron \n\nscattering (QENS), NMR spectroscopy and diffusion techniques (DIAT \nand GEBEL, 2008). The modeling techniques are based mainly on \nMolecular Dynamic Simulation (MDS) models to calculate the \nscattering intensity in small-angle X-ray or neutron scattering \n(SAXS/SANS) for a tentative Nafion\u00ae structure, seeking to match the \ncalculated and measured scattering results. \n\n2.1.3.1.1 Structure \n\nGierke and co-workers (GIERKE et al., 1981; HSU and \nGIERKE, 1982; HSU and GIERKE, 1983) were the first to propose a \ncluster-network model for the Nafion morphology. In this pioneering \nwork, from information obtained from small and wide-angle x-ray \ndiffraction (SAXD and WAXD) and assuming the minimization of \ninterfacial area, i.e., the minimization of the total energy of the \nmembrane (WEBER and NEWMAN, 2003), Nafion\u00ae was thought as \norganized in a series of inverted spherical clusters (reverse micelles) \nwith about 4 nm diameter connected by short cylindrical pores 1 nm \ndiameter forming a three-dimensional network. According to the author, \nthis configuration minimizes both, the hydrophobic interaction of water \n\n\n\n60 \n\nwith the backbone and the electrostatic repulsion of proximate \nsulfonated groups (HSU and GIERKE, 1983). The growth of clusters by \nincreasing the water content occurred by a combination of expansion of \ncluster size and redistribution of sulfonated sites, yielding fewer cluster \nfor higher water content. In this model, by assuming a simple-cubic \nlattice, the cluster diameter, the number of exchange sites per cluster and \nthe number of water molecules per exchange site increased linearly with \nwater content. From this initial model, other interpretations of SAXD, \nWAXD and transport data have led to slightly different models, \nhowever all of them rely on the same basic network structure (see the \nreview by Mauritz and Moore, 2004). \n\nThis view endured more than 20 years and was replaced recently \nby a picture that depicts Nafion\u00ae as an amorphous/crystalline structure \nin which the water is not confined in spherical cavities but separating \nfibrillar objects, running in parallel through the material and, as \nhydration increases, it forms a continuous medium around an intrinsic \nanisotropic structure (ROLLET et al., 2002, RUBATAT et al., 2002. \nRUBATAT et al., 2004; RUBATAT, GEBEL, and DIAT, 2004; \nSCHMIDT-ROHR and CHEN, 2008a, SCHMIDT-ROHR and CHEN, \n2008b). The new view of Nafion\u00ae is based on evidence of the \n\ncrystallinity at low scattering vector qSA ( 4 sinSAq ? ? ?= ,where ?  is \nthe scattering angle and ?  is the X-ray  or neutron wavelength) of \nSANS (ROLLET et al., 2002,). Schmidt-Rohr and Chen (2008a) \ncomparing MDS simulation to SAXD measurements, the author \nsuggested that Nafion is formed by straight water channel surrounded by \nsulfonic groups, supported by the PTFE backbone and Nafion \ncrystallites. Figure 8 shows a representation of the water-channel model \nof Nafion, at a hydration level of 20 vol% (11wt%) water according to \nSchmidt-Rohr and Chen (2008a). In the figure (a) a) Longitudinal and \ncross-section view of the inverted-micelle cylinder, showing the \npolymer backbone and the ionic side groups lining the water channel. \n(b) Rendering of a bundle of channels forming an approximate \nhexagonal arrangement.

(d) Small-\nangle scattering data (circles) at 20 vol% water content when compared \nto the results calculated from the structural model in (c). The \nsimulations of the structure proposed by Gierke and co-workers, as well \nas other tentative structures, resulted in poor agreement with the \n\n\n\n61 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nmeasurements at 20 vol% hydration. In the description that resulted in \nthe best agreement, the channels, which are locally parallel to their \nneighbors and can be considered as cylindrical inverted micelles, are \nstabilized on the outside by the relatively straight helical backbone \nsegments. Considering a length of between 3 to 5 nm for the Nafion\u00ae \nbackbone, the densely packed cylinders with their shell of relatively stiff \nbackbone can be expected to have a length of tens of nanometers \n(SCHMIDT-ROHR and CHEN, 2008a). The cluster diameter estimated \nfrom SANX peak position is around 4nm, however the water channels \nhave diameters distributed between 1.8 and 3.5 nm, with an average of \n2.4 nm. The crystallites (~ 14 vol%) are elongated and parallel to the \nwater channels, with cross sections of about 5 nm2 (SCHMIDT-ROHR \nand CHEN, 2008a) \n\nFigure 8 -Parallel water channel model of Nafion\u00ae . (SCHMIDT-ROHR \nAND CHEN, 2008a) \n\nThe crystallites have a relevant function in the membrane \nstructure, they provide mechanical strength, acting as physical \ncrosslinks (INZELT et al., 2000). They are elongated and approximately \ncylindrical. In particular, it is expected that the crystallites help align the \nwater cylinders, and in a non-crystalline sample the water cylinders \nwould meander more strongly (VAN der HEIJDEN; RUBATAT; DIAT, \n2004) (KIM, et al., 2006). The crystallinity at 1100 equivalent weight \nhas been estimated to range between 5 and 20%, based on wide-angle \nX-ray diffraction. The intercrystalline repeat length is 10 to 20 nm, \naccording to the position of the \u2018matrix knee\u2019 in SAXS (SCHMIDT-\nROHR and CHEN, 2008a). WASX and SANX results show that the \ndegree of crystallinity does not strongly differ between Nafion\u00ae  117 \nand Nafion\u00ae  125, and the observations suggest that mainly the size and \nnot the amount of the crystalline region changes by varying the \nequivalent weight (VAN der HEIJDEN, BOUZENAD and DIAT, \n\n\n\n62 \n\n2004). Nafion also presents anisotropy induced by strain, probably \ngenerated during extrusion, aligning the aggregates in the machine \ndirection and these aggregates present large-scale correlation \n(MAURITZ and MOORE, 2004).  \n\n2.1.3.1.2 Hydration \n\nThe hydration of Nafion apparently follows a two-stage process \n(RUBATAT, GEBEL and DIAT, 2004). First, there is the hydration of \nthe charged surface around the polymeric aggregates followed by \ngrowth of the water layer beyond monolayers. Secondly, and only when \nthe volume fraction was higher than 60%, there is the swelling of \ncollapsed regions, opening the proton conducting channels up to the \nmaximum diameter at saturation. These two regimes are represented in \nFigure 9 (RUBATAT et al., 2002) (a) Hydration of the charged surfaces \nfollowed by growth of water layers, (b) Opening of collapsed regions. \n\nFigure 9 - Two-stage Nafion swelling: (RUBATAT et al., 2004) \n\n \nThe collapsed dry regions keep the relative permeability to the \n\ngas phase very small, while hydrating increases the relative permeability \nto the liquid phase. Sulfonic acid has a very high water-of-hydration, \nabsorbing 13 molecules of water for every sulfonic acid group in the \npolymer. Assuming the diameter of the water molecule as 1.2 A and the \ndiameter of the water channel as 24 A at 20 wt% water content, from \n\n\n\n63 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nabout 400 water molecules filling the cross section of the water channel, \n126 molecules on average fit adsorbed as double-layer lining the \nchannel walls. The remaining 68% of the total amount of water \nmolecules are relatively free to flow along the channel. This reinforces a \nview of a molecular water flow along the channels lined by a strongly \nadsorbed hydration layer covering the hydrophilic sites.  \n\n2.1.3.1.3 Transport Properties \n\nThe diameter of the channels increases with the hydration. As a \nresult, the protonic conductance is strongly dependent on the \nhumidification. The average distance between sulfonic groups at the \nchannel surfaces is about 0.8 to 0.9 nm. Since the channels are relatively \nlarge, the water in the channels have bulk properties (dielectric constant \n? ? 80), at least for water content above 20 wt% (JANG et al., 2004). \nDue to size, percolation and long range electrostatic effects both proton \nand water self-diffusivities are strongly humidity dependent, ranging \nfrom 10?7 to 10?4 cm2/s at 300 K (SCHUSTER et al., 2010). Jang et al. \n(2004) report values of 0.7 \u00d7 10?5 cm2/s and 1.5 \u00d7 10?5 cm2/s at 27\u00b0C e \n80\u00b0C (SCHMIDT-ROHR, 2008a).From the electrical point of view \nNafion\u00ae  membranes exhibit a protonic conductivity as high as \n0,10S/cm under fully hydrated conditions. Specifically for Nafion\u00ae 117 \n(with 175 \u00b5m of thickness) this conductivity corresponds to a real \nresistance of 0,2 Ohm cm2,i.e. , a voltage loss of about 150 mV at a \ncurrent density of 750mA/cm2 (DHATHATHREYAN and \nRAJALAKSHMI, 2007) The relatively higher diameter of the water \nchannels, when compared to previous models (such as Gierke and co-\nworkers), also explains why the water diffusivity at 20 wt% hydration is \nonly 10 times smaller than the self-diffusivity in bulk water \n(SCHMIDT-ROHR, 2008a). The straight channels in Nafion\u00ae favor a \nlarge hydrodynamic component of the water diffusion, when compared \nto more tortuous structure present in other polymers (SCHMIDT-\nROHR, 2008a). The hydration model presented above also suggests why \npercolation occurs for 4 vol% water, much lower than the 16 vol% water \ncontent for percolation in random packed structures. Observations \nsuggest that, while the water in Nafion\u00ae seems to freeze at ?20 ?C \n(TASAKA, et al., 1988; THOMPSON, et al., 2006), diffusion in Nafion \npersist down to ?50 ?C (SAITO et al, 2005, CAPPADONIA et al., 1994, \nTHOMPSON, et al., 2006). Allowing for a size distribution of water \nchannels, while the water would freeze at the larger channels it would \n\n\n\n64 \n\nstill remain mobile in the smaller channels down to ?70 ?C, providing \nthe observed relatively high diffusivity at sub-freezing temperatures. \nThe model developed by Schmidt-Rohr (2008), however, does not \nspecify on which length scales beyond 20 nm the channels bend and \nmerge. Therefore, there is still a lack of fundamental information on \npore branching and long range correlation in the flow direction.  \n\nThe proton transport includes both the diffusion of hydronium \nions H3O\n\n+ as well as the hopping of free hydrogen ions H+ between \nwater molecules. Measurements include the effects of both. Predictions \nof the diffusion of H3O\n\n+ by MDS only have reported values of 0.3 \u00d7 \n10?5 cm2/s at 353 K (Jang et al., 2004). When a vehicle mechanism \nthrough H3O\n\n+ is responsible for proton transport, the migration of each \nproton would be linked with the transport of at least one water molecule. \nIn practical fuel cells, a mixed transport process is believed to occur, \nleading to a certain electro-osmotic drag factor of water molecules per \nproton (in the order of 0.6 to 2.0). This flux is largely compensated by \nback diffusion (from cathode to anode) of neutral water molecules \naccording to Fick\u00b4s law. The electro-osmotic drag depends primarily on \nthe nature of the polymer and the temperature but not on thickness \n(HOOGERS, 2003). This will be discussed later. \n\n2.1.3.2 Gas Diffusion Layers \n\nThe polymeric membrane is sandwiched between two sheets of \nporous backing layer (a more suitable name when considering all their \nfunctions).These sheets are commonly referenced as Gas Diffusion \nLayer GDL, or gas diffusion media substrate. GDLs are important for \ngas spreading and transporting, the electron/heat capture and transport \nand in water management. They are porous media commonly made of \nwoven carbon cloth (Figure 10a) or carbon paper (Figure 10b and Figure \n10c) with carbon fiber of about 7 \u00b5m diameter. Thicknesses between \n100 \u00b5m to 500\u00b5m are available according to the material used and \nnecessity. Thinner GDLs are desirable as they offer less electrical and \nmass transport resistance but they can have difficulty in providing good \nelectrical contact with bipolar plates (MATHUR and CRAWFORD, \n2007). Figure 10 shows photographs obtained by environmental \nscanning electron microscopy (SEM) of typical GDLs. a) SEM of \ncarbon clothes material (MATHIAS 2003) b) SEM image of cross \nsection of the GDL (GOSTICK, 2006) c) SEM of Toray\u00ae carbon fiber \npaper (GURAU, 2006). d) Water droplets formation on Toray carbon \nfiber paper (GURAU, 2006). \n\n\n\n65 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nFigure 10 - Micrographs of gas diffusing media substrates for fuel cell. \n\n \nThe properties of the GDL are ruled by their function. According \n\nto this concept, GDL must be porous enough to allow flow in both \ndirections, through plane and in plane, of reactant gases and product \nwater (which are in opposite directions in the cathode). At the same time \nit must have adequate size to match with the small discreet particles on \nfacing the catalyst layer (average porous diameter between 40\u00b5m and \n50\u00b5m for the carbon fiber paper is commonly found (MATHIAS, et al., \n2003 )); it must be electrically and thermal conducting again in both \ndirections because of the electronic flux and for thermal management. \nGDL needs to be sufficiently rigid to support the flimsy MEA, but also \nit must have flexibility to maintain good electrical contact where the \nelectrical resistance becomes relevant.  \n\nAs a gas diffuser, GDL has the role of allowing the diffusion of \nhydrogen and oxygen from the respective channels down to the catalyst \nsites. Besides oxygen diffusion, the cathode GDL is an important \ncomponent in water management. In the cathode GDL, the excess water \nshould condensate in the form of small droplets on the fiber surface \n(Figure 10d). Part of the liquid water produced in the cathode flows out \nthrough the cathode GDL by capillary liquid flow and gas\u2013phase \nconcentration induced mass diffusion (GURAU et al., 2006). This liquid \nwater increases the risk of liquid blocking the pores within the substrate \naffecting the effective porosity of the GDL and modifying its gas \ntransport, a situation that affects the gas access to the reactive zone. \nWater management depends on the wettability (at the anode) and the \nhydrophobicity (at the cathode). Only water vapor and hydrogen should \n\n\n\n66 \n\nbe transported in the anode GDL. Surface features that increase the \ncontact angle of the water as polarity and roughness can help to prevent \nflooding. The hydrophobicity of GDLs is obtained by using a \nhydrophobic material like PTFE or other special material to ensure the \nwater is driven out. Wet proofing rejects excess liquid water so that the \ncatalyst layer will not be flooded by water thus improving the catalyst \nperformance. It also helps maintain the water balance in the membrane \nby allowing the appropriate amount of water to reach the membrane and \ndraining the excess water. Moreover, PTFE is not electrically \nconductive then the amount used in the GDL composition must be \ncarefully observed (nowadays 33% of the weight is a common value) \n(MATHUR and CRAWFORD, 2007). Gurau et al. (2006) present a \ndiscussion on the contact angle of water droplets in GDLs. \nImprovements in the catalyst performance have not been followed by \ncorresponding advances in GDL technology and  water management \nproblems increase. The main macroscopic properties affecting the \nperformance of the GDL are the capillary pressure, the water relative \npermeability and the fraction of hydrophilic and hydrophobic pores. \nThese topics are analyzed by Gostick et al. (2006) and Nam and \nKaviany (2003). The use of additional thin surface layers (less than 50 \n\u00b5m) on the GDL is common to improve the electrical contact with the \ncatalytic layer and to help with water management. These additional \nlayers are commonly called microporous layers and provide effective \nwicking of liquid water from the cathode toward the GDL. They have \npore size on the order of carbon agglomerates, between 100 and 500 nm, \nalmost two orders of magnitude lower than the GDL fibers. A common \nexample is a micro-porous layer made of carbon or graphite particles \nmixed with a polymeric blinder (MATHIAS et al., 2003).  \n\n2.1.3.3 Catalyst Layer \n\nCatalyst layers of PEM fuel cell are platinum-based catalysts for \nboth anode and cathode and consist of nano-size platinum crystallites \nnested on carbon particles that in turn form agglomerates on a \nmicroporous matrix (the binder), as in Figure 11. This matrix gives \norigin to a highly porous reactive layer that is directly responsible for \nthe reaction. A catalyst binder is an ionomer that supports the carbon \nparticle, and is intended to have an optimum morphology and \nmicrostructure able to sustain and disperse the distribution of the \ncatalyst. A catalyst layer can be applied either on the membrane or on \nthe GDL by spreading, spraying, sputtering, painting screen printing \n\n\n\n67 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\ndecaling, evaporative deposition and impregnation reduction and others, \nfollowed by a hot-pressing process (NITTA, 2008).  \n\nNeglecting the presence of CO, the overall anode reaction is \nhydrogen oxidation. Effective electrochemical and heterogeneous \nreaction is assumed to occur only at the interface between the electrolyte \nionomer and the solid phase in the catalyst layer. Homogeneous \nreactions in the gas phase usually do not happen. In the anode catalyst, \nhydrogen molecules are absorbed (they can be absorbed as molecules or \ndissociated, according to the mechanism assumed (BREITER, 1969). \nThen these new radicals react with water to form the hydronium ion \ndelivering two electrons. Electrons then travel through the carbon \nsupport, and protons (as hydronium ions) diffuse through the water \ninside the ionomer and ultimately inside the polymer membrane. \nBesides reactants, electrons and protons, the different layers also \ntransport heat, which is produced mainly from the cathode reaction. \nLocal thermal equilibrium can be assumed between the gas and liquid \nphases (BASCHUK, 2004). Figure 11 is a representation of the catalyst \nlayer. The details attempt a better description of the structure of the \ncarbon support and metallic particles. The agglomerates of particles can \nbe seen, in detail a) the TEM image of fuel cell catalyst (LARMINIE \nand DICKS, 2003), the black specks are the catalyst particles finely \ndivided over a carbon support. In b) the detail representing the ionomer \nreaching the catalyst particles. In c) it is represented the platinum \nparticle and the hydrogen reaction on it. Figure 12 is the enlargement of \ndetail c in Figure 11. This figure is a simplified sketch of the mechanism \nof the hydrogen reaction on the metallic particle. The ionomer (binder in \nblue) holds the carbon particles and let the water reach the platinum \nparticle. The ionomer (binder in blue) holds the carbon particles and let \nthe water reach the platinum particle. On the reaction site the three \nphase are present, to allow every species to move. \n\n \n\n\n\n68 \n\nFigure 11 \u2013 Rendering representing (b) the platinum crystallites \ncovering the carbon particles.  \n\n \n[(a) is a TEM micrograph], the pore structure, the polymer/water layers and (c) \nthe hydrogen molecules undergoing adsorptive dissociation. \n \nFigure 12 - Rendering of the platinum crystallites attached to a carbon particle. \n\n \nThe polymer/water layers and the hydrogen molecules undergoing adsorptive \ndissociation to electrons (-) and hydrogen cations (+). \n\n \n\n\n\n69 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nSince the species involved diffuse within different phases - \nelectrons move on solid phase, reactants move in gaseous phase, and \nprotons move in liquid phase - the catalytic site needs to be bound by a \nthree phase boundary to make the reaction possible. The site by itself is \nthe solid phase that allows the flow of electrons, which in turn is bound \nby a gas phase that allows access of the gas reactants and a liquid water \nphase, embedded in the polymer matrix, needed to take/deliver the \nprotons that participate in the reaction. Setting the necessary amount of \nwater is one of the most difficult tasks. Too much water can either flood \nthe porous media or cover the catalytic sites preventing the access of the \ngas reactants. Some characteristics such as high hydraulic permeability \nand ionic conductivity are desirable in the catalytic layer (MATHIAS et \nal., 2003). Since the oxygen reduction reaction is slower than the \nhydrogen oxidation, more platinum catalyst is required in the cathode. \n\n2.1.4  Other peripheral devices \n\nDue to the chemical nature of the process, the fuel cell operation \nis highly dependent on the temperature, thus systems for thermal control \nare imperative. For very high power densities such as those attained in \nautomotive stacks, liquid cooling is mandatory and fuel cell stacks need \nother components in order to humidify and remove heat. For less \ndemanding applications air cooling is commonly applied. In the simplest \ncase, the cathode flow fields are open to ambient, and reactant air is \nsupplied by a fan, at the same time providing cooling. A typical fan \ncooled system in the PEM fuel cell bench at LabCET is described by \nMari\u00f1o (2011) and Nunes (2011). Recent studies (SILVA, 2010) have \ninvestigated the application of thermal management by a system based \non capillary pumped loop CPL and heat pipes, which can save more \nuseful energy increasing the global efficiency of the system. A second \nfunction sometimes integrated into the stack is reactant humidification. \nThe literature describes several types of humidifiers, bubblers, \nmembrane or fiber bundle humidifiers and water evaporators. The \nsimplest humidifier is the well-known bubbler, i.e., the wash bottle \ndesign with gas directly passing through the liquid. This approach \nallows poor control of humidification is less suited within a complex \nfuel cell system and may cause potential safety hazards due to the direct \ncontact of the fluid. Membrane humidifiers are an array where a semi-\npermeable membrane separates a compartment filled with water from a \ncompartment with the reactant gas. Ideally the gas is conducted along \nthe membrane and continually increases its humidity up to or close to \n\n\n\n70 \n\nsaturation as it passes from the gas inlet to the gas outlet. Instead of \nliquid water, the use of the water-saturated cathode off-gas has been \nsuggested for cathode or cathode and anode humidification \n(HOOGERS, 2003). \n\n2.2 BASIC THEORY OF PROCESSES OCCURRING IN FUEL \nCELLS \n\nThe operation of fuel cells can be explained qualitatively and \nquantitatively from the basic principles of Thermochemistry, \nElectrochemistry, Membrane Science, Interface Phenomena, Chemical \nKinetics and Mass Transport. Based on these principles a general \noverview, considered necessary for the developing of the membrane \nmodel of the fuel cell operation, is presented in this section.  \n\nInitially a global description of the several macro fluxes within \nthe operating cell will give the reader a main context. Then a \nthermodynamic overview attempts a comprehensive description of the \nelectrochemical phenomena in fuel cells by describing thermodynamic \npotential commonly used but with focus on the electrochemical \nperformance. Equilibrium criteria based on these thermodynamic \npotentials are defined and compared according to the kind of work that a \nsystem would perform. In the presence of the extra non-expansion work \nthe equilibrium criteria are modified. Also the total useful work of a \nsystem and the maximum work from a process are defined. Aware of the \nelectrical nature of the work performed by the fuel cell, the electrical \nwork is defined as a function of charge movement and potential. \nFollowing the chemical potential is defined for ideal and real gas, and \nthen the chemical equilibrium is discussed. In this discussion the \nreaction Gibbs energy is obtained. The reaction Gibbs energy identifies \nthe spontaneous direction of a reaction and some conditions for \nchemical equilibrium are explored. Later, a comprehensive description \nof an electrochemical cell provides the relation between reaction Gibbs \nenergy and electrical potential which is the central point of connection \nbetween thermodynamic and electric behavior of the fuel cell. The well-\nknown Nernst equation is obtained and a simple analysis of the water \nglobal reaction will give the value of the standard electrical potential for \nthe PEM fuel cell. Finally, first and second laws efficiencies provide a \npoint of comparison between fuel cells and heat engines. One \nconclusion from this comparison is that an energy conversion process \nthat occurs at a constant temperature is more efficient than a process that \nrelies on large temperature differences. \n\n\n\n71 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\n2.2.1 Thermodynamics \n\nThermodynamics properties define the thermodynamic state of a \nsubstance or a system in equilibrium. A system is said to be in \nequilibrium if no changes in pressure, temperature, phase, and chemical \ncomposition occur within the system when it is isolated from its \nsurroundings. In electrochemical process, the Gibbs energy G \n( G H TS= ? ) that measures the \"useful\" or process-initiating work \nobtainable from an isothermal, isobaric process, is useful for expressing \nthe equilibrium conditions. The Gibbs free energy is the maximum \namount of non-expansion work which can be extracted from a closed \nsystem. The maximum work can be attained only in a completely \nreversible process. \n\n2.2.1.1  Equilibrium in Electrochemical Processes \n\nFor a closed system, neglecting kinetic and potential energy, the \nfirst law of the thermodynamics can be expressed as \n\ndU Q W? ?= +\n (2.1) \n\nwhere U is the internal energy, Q the net exchanged heat from the \nsurroundings to the system and W is the total work performed by the \nsystem to the surroundings.  \nFor an isolated system in equilibrium, the entropy is a maximum. The \ntotal work W can be divided in expansion work (-pV for reversible \nprocesses) and non-expansion work or extra work (We). Non-expansion \nwork involves all the other forms of work that can cross the boundary of \nthe system, including electrical work as in the case of fuel cells. The \nmain fuel cell process is an electrochemical reaction that occurs at \nconstant pressure and temperature. For this reason, in fuel cell, \nequilibrium criteria expressed in terms of the Gibbs free energy are \nconvenient. \n\nFor a reversible process where only expansion work \n( W pdV? = ? ) exists, it is possible to express the second law as \n\n( ) erevQ Td S? = . Using the first law, equation (2.1), we have: \ne\n\ndU Td S pdV= ?  (2.2)  \n\nwere \n\ne i\ndS d S d S= +     (2. 3) \n\nIn this form dU can be expressed as \n\ni\ndU TdS pdV Td S= ? ?    (2.4) \n\n\n\n72 \n\nand for a closed system at constant S and V we have \n0dS dV= =     (2.5) \n\nthen \n0\n\ni\ndU Td S= ?  (2.6) \n\nFrom the definition of Gibbs energy G H TS= ? , and enthalpy  \nH U pV= + definition, we have dG dH TdS SdT= ? ?  \n\n( )dG dU d pV TdS SdT= + ? ?  (2.7) \nFor a process at constant temperature and pressure \n\n( )\n,p T\n\ndG dU pdV TdS= + ?\n \n\n(2.8) \n\nFinally, using equation (2.6) we have \n\n( )\n,\n\n0\np T\n\ndG ?     (2.9) \n\nTherefore, the change in Gibbs free energy indicates the direction \nof the spontaneous reaction for an isothermal and isobaric process. \nConversely, the inequality ( )\n\n,\n0\n\np T\ndG ? indicates that, at constant \n\ntemperature and pressure, chemical reactions are spontaneous in the \ndirection of decreasing Gibbs energy. For a spontaneous endothermic \nreaction, despite dG &lt;0, H increases. It follows that the entropy of the \nsystem increases enough to guarantee that TdS is strongly positive and \nhigher in magnitude than dH in dG = dH \u2013 TdS. \n\nWhen other kinds of work different from expansion work occur, \nthe equilibrium criteria change based on the contribution of this extra \nwork. Taking again the Gibbs free energy, it can be seen that now the \nwork in equation (2.1) is defined as  \n\ne\nW pdV dW? = ? ?     (2.10) \n\nThen, the inequality in equation (2.2) becomes \n\ne\ndU TdS pdV dW? ? ?  (2.11) \n\nand at the end, comparing equation (2.11) with equation (2.8), we say \nthat the equilibrium criteria based on Gibbs energy for a process at \nconstant temperature and pressure where other work exists besides that \nof expansion is expressed as \n\n( )\n,\n\n0\nep T\n\ndG dW+ ?     (2.12) \n\nThis process at constant T and p applies to fuel cells. \n\n2.2.1.2 Maximum Work and Electrical Work.  \n\n\n\n73 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E.

If this change \nis carried out down to the standard state, the Gibbs energy is also equal \nto the exergy of the system or the maximum useful work. A system \ndelivers the maximum useful work as it undergoes a reversible process \nfrom the specified initial state to the state of its environment (\u00c7ENGEL \nand BOLES, 2005). \n\nThe electrical work performed by the fuel cell can be understood \nas the work to move the electrical charge (electrons) from the anode to \nthe cathode against a potential difference.

The purpose of this section is not to \nprovide a basic discussion on electrochemical phenomena but only to \nprovide the elements needed to determine its direct influence on the fuel \ncell operation.  \n\nAn electrochemical cell consists of two electrodes, electrically \nconnected, made of metallic conductors, in contact with an electrolyte, \nwhere a chemical reaction is linked to an electrical current (see Figure \n14). The electrolyte is a chemical component that is dissociated into ions \nin solid or liquid forms. It plays the role of ionic conductor and \nelectrical insulator. A galvanic cell is an electrochemical cell that \nproduces electricity as the result of the spontaneous reaction (exergonic \nreaction) occurring inside it. An electrolytic cell is an electrochemical \ncell in which a non-spontaneous reaction (endergonic reaction) is driven \nby an external source of current. \n\nThe electrochemical reaction in a galvanic cell is a chemical \nreaction (at constant temperature and pressure) that is divided in two \nsteps which occur in each electrode. There is a flow of electrons from \none electrode where the first half-reaction occurs to the other where the \nsecond half-reaction occurs, generating an electric current and potential.  \n\n\n\n76 \n\nFigure 14 - Sketch of an electrochemical cell. Positive charges are cations \nand negative charges are electrons \n\n \n\nThe first part of the reaction is the oxidation and consists of a loss \nof electrons of one of the reactants that becomes a positive ion (cation). \nThese ions flow through the electrolyte. The electrode in which \noxidation occurs is the anode (negative) and this half-reaction can be \nrepresented as  \n\n11Red Ox ze\n?? +     (2.26) \n\nThe second part of the reaction is the reduction of the other \nreactant, consisting of the reception of electrons, forming the product of \nthe global reaction. The electrode where the second half-reaction occurs \nis the cathode (positive) and this half-reaction can be represented as \n\n2 2Ox ze Red\n?+ ?     (2.27) \n\nAs the reaction proceeds, the electrons released in the oxidation \nreaction on the anode flow through the external circuit and return to the \ncell through the cathode, being absorbed in the reduction reaction. In a \ngalvanic cell, the cathode has a higher electric potential than the anode \nbecause the species undergoing reduction, Ox2, withdraws electrons \nfrom its electrode (the cathode), so leaving a relative positive charge on \nit (corresponding to a high electric potential). At the anode, the \noxidation results in the transfer of electrons to the electrode, so giving it \na relative negative charge (corresponding to a low electric potential). \n\nA cell in which the overall cell reaction has not reached chemical \nequilibrium can do electric work as the reaction drives electrons through \nan external circuit. The work that a given transfer of electrons can \naccomplish depends on the potential difference between the two \nelectrodes. This potential difference is called the cell potential and is \nmeasured in volts (V). When the cell potential is large, a given number \n\n\n\n77 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nof electrons traveling between the electrodes can do a large amount of \nelectrical work. The nature of this potential will be discussed later. A \ncell in which the overall reaction is at equilibrium can do no work, and \nthen the cell potential is zero. \n\nFrom equation (2.16) we know that the maximum electrical work \nthat a system can do under reversible conditions is given by the value of \n\nG? . On the other hand, the variation of the Gibbs energy in a \n\nchemical reaction \nr\nG?  is evaluated at a specific composition of the \n\nreaction mixture. In order to obtain the relation between G? , \n\nmaximum extra work, and \nr\nG?  both reversible operation and constant \n\ncomposition are necessary. These two conditions can be obtained by \nmeasuring the cell potential when it is balanced by an exactly opposing \nsource of electric potential. The resulting potential difference is called \nthe zero-current cell potential (theoretical), E (formerly, and still \ncommonly, called the \u2018electromotive force\u2019, or emf, of the cell) \n(ATKINS, 1998). The relation between this potential and the change in \nGibbs free energy when the reactants change composition by an amount \nd? moles is, \n\nr\ndG Gd?= ?     (2.28) \n\nSubstituting this value of the Gibbs energy change in equation (2.15) we \nobtain the value of maximum electrical work that the reaction can do as \nit advances by d? at constant temperature and pressure, \n\n,e max e rdW dW Gd?= = ?  (2.29) \nThis work is infinitesimal, and the composition of the system is \n\nvirtually constant when it occurs. From the extent of reaction, we can \nobtain a relation for the electrical work of the electrons traveling from \nthe anode to the cathode. Suppose that the reaction advances by d? \n[moles], then z d? moles of electrons must travel from the anode to the \ncathode. The total charge transported between the electrodes when this \n\nchange occurs is ( ) ( )AeN zd?? , onde NA is the Avogadro number and -\neNA is the charge per mole of electrons. This can be expressed \nas ( )zFd?? , where F= eNA is the Faraday constant. Since, from \nequation (2.20), the electrical work produced by a charge moving \nthrough a potential is \n\nel\nW q ?= ? ? , we conclude that the work done \n\nwhen an infinitesimal charge ( )zFd??  travels from the anode to the \n\n\n\n78 \n\ncathode is equal to the product of the charge and the potential difference \nE, \n\n( )edW zFd E?= ?  (2.30) \nComparing the electrical work from equation (2.29) and equation \n\n(2.30) we can obtain the relation between the reaction Gibbs energy and \nthe theoretical cell potential E, \n\nr\nG zFE? = ?\n\n \n(2.31) \n\nIn the literature, several names are used to refer to the cell \npotential E, such as: zero-current cell potential or equilibrium reduction \npotential (ATKINS, 1998); electromotive force (EMF) or theoretical \nopen circuit voltage (TOCV) (KORDESCH and SIMADER, 1996); \nelectromotive force, reversible open circuit voltage, Nernst voltage or \nreversible cell voltage (LARMINIE and DICKS, 2003). \n\nEquation (2.31) is the key connection between electrical \nmeasurements on the one hand and thermodynamic properties on the \nother. Thus, by knowing the reaction Gibbs energy at a specified \ncomposition, we can state the theoretical cell potential E at that \ncomposition. Note that a negative reaction Gibbs energy, a spontaneous \nexergonic cell reaction, corresponds to a positive zero-current cell \npotential E. The above equation also shows that the driving power of a \ncell (that is, the theoretical cell potential E), is proportional to the slope \nof the Gibbs energy with respect to the extent of the reaction. Figure 15 \npresents a rendering of the relation of the reaction Gibbs energy and the \npotential with the extent of reaction, as described by equation (2.31). A \nspontaneous reaction occurs in the direction of decreasing Gibbs energy. \nThe spontaneous direction of change can be expressed in terms of the \ncell potential E. The reaction is spontaneous when E>0. The reverse \nreaction is spontaneous when E<0 (it needs energy to happen). When \nthe cell reaction is at equilibrium, the cell potential is zero. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n79 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nFigure 15 \u2013 Rendering showing the relation between reaction Gibbs energy \nand electrical potential.  \n\n \n \n\nIt is plausible that a reaction with E>0 that is far from \nequilibrium (when the slope is steep) has a strong tendency to drive \nelectrons through an external circuit. When the slope is close to zero \n(when the cell reaction is close to equilibrium), the theoretical cell \npotential is small. Due to the fact that this potential corresponds to that \nof a fuel cell at open circuit (a condition of chemical equilibrium at the \nelectrodes), it would give a maximum voltage but would not produce \npower because no net flow of electrons between the electrodes would \noccur. For a real situation of an idling cell, the measured potential \ndifference between terminals (the open circuit voltages, OCV), is \nactually lower than E, because this is affected by the parasitic \nelectrochemical process (irreversibilities) that occurs next to the two \nelectrodes. To produce electricity, the electrodes must be polarized, i.e. \nthere needs to be an electrical potential to move the reactions away from \nequilibrium.  \n\nThe standard reaction Gibbs energy can also be expressed in \nterms of other standard potential, for example, the standard entropies \nand enthalpies of reaction,  \n\no o o\n\nr r r\nG H T S? = ? ? ?     (2.32) \n\n\n\n80 \n\nWe can also define the standard Gibbs energy of formation \no\n\nf\nG? as the standard reaction Gibbs energy for the formation of a \n\ncompound from its elements in their reference states. Then we can \n\nobtain the standard reaction Gibbs energy o\nr\nG?  from \n\nProduct Reactant\n\no o o\n\nr f f\nG G G? ?? = ? ? ?? ?   (2.33) \n\nBoth expressions are equivalent.  \n\n2.2.1.5  The Nernst Equation  \n\nThe theoretical cell potential E can be related to the activities of \nreactants and products by the definition of the reaction quotient Kr as  \n\nlno\nr r r\nG G RT K? = ? +    (2.34) \n\nwhere o\nr\nG? is the standard reaction Gibbs free energy and the reaction \n\nquotient Kr is related to the activities of reactants and products by  \ni\n\nr i\n\ni\n\nK a\n?= ?  \n\nDividing both sides by zF?  and using equation (2.31) gives \n\n ln\no\n\nr\nr\n\nG RT\nE K\n\nzF zF\n\n?\n= ? ?   (2.35) \n\nDefining the standard cell potential \no\n\nE (also called standard \nelectromotive force (KORDESCH and SIMADER, 1996) and standard \n\nreduction potential (ATKINS, 1998)), as\no o\n\nr\nE G zF= ? ? , which is \n\nthe standard reaction Gibbs energy expressed as an electrical potential \n(in volts) at standard pressure, we have the Nernst equation \n\nlno\nr\n\nRT\nE E K\n\nzF\n= ?    (2.36) \n\nThe Nernst equation is used to calculate the theoretical cell \npotential E at T and p of an electrochemical cell (or half-cell) from its \nstandard cell potential Eo at To and po, and the activities of reactants and \nproducts. From the definition of Kr, the theoretical cell potential E and \nthe standard potential Eo are unchanged if the chemical equation for the \ncell reaction is multiplied by a numerical factor. When the reaction \nGibbs energy increases, the number of electrons transferred increases in \nthe same proportion. Figure 16 shows the relation expressed by Nernst \nequation where the vertical axis is the difference between the standard \n\n\n\n81 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nconditions potential and the theoretical potential at other conditions, \ntimes the factor RT/F which is 25.69 mV at 298K. The horizontal axis is \nthe value of the reaction quotient. Every line in the figure corresponds to \na different number of electrons transferred per mol. For fuel cells, high \npositive potential differences (E-Eo) are necessary, thus negative values \nof the reaction quotient are desired. This effect is improved in reactions \nthat exchange only one electron. \n\nFigure 16 - The variation of the cell potential with the value of the reaction \n\n \nWhen ln Kr = 0, the standard cell potential can be interpreted as \n\nthe theoretical cell potential E. In the case of equilibrium, the process \ndoes not generate work, generating zero potential difference between the \nelectrodes. For this situation Kr=K, where K is the equilibrium constant \nof the cell reaction and the Nernst equation gives \n\n ln\no\n\nzFE\nK\n\nRT\n=     (2.37) \n\nThis equation allows us to predict equilibrium constants from \nmeasured standard cell potentials. Electrochemical tables of standard \npotentials provide defined values for half reaction potentials from which \nit is possible to determine the sign of the cell potential. If the standard \n\npotential is a positive value, that would imply that 0o\nr\nG? &lt; and hence \n\nthat K>1 (ATKINS, 1998). \nFor a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell, the electrochemical half-\n\nreactions that take place at the anode and the cathode catalyst layers, \nrespectively, are (values of the potential will be analyzed below) \n\n2 2 2 0\no\n\nH H e E V\n+ ?? + =     (2.38) \n\n2 21 2 2 2 1.23\no\n\nO H e H O E V\n+ ?+ + ? = +   (2.39) \n\n\n\n82 \n\nElectrons flow from the half-cell with lower electrical potential to \nthe half-cell with higher electrical potential thus, performing work. In \nthis direction hydrogen is consumed at the anode and oxygen is \nconsumed at the cathode producing water. The overall stoichiometric \nreaction is \n\n2 2 21 2H O H O+ ?  (2.40) \nand summing the half-cell electrical potentials we obtain Eo=1.23 V. \nSince in this case Eo>0 it means that for equilibrium 0o\n\nr\nG? &lt;, and K>1 \n\nwhich means that equation (2.40) is the spontaneous direction that the \nreaction follows. In this reaction, two electrons are transferred, \ntherefore, z = 2. Assuming ideal gas species we can write \n\n2\n\n2 2\n\n1/ 2\n\n1/ 2\nln ln\n\no o\nH Oo\n\no\n\nH O\n\np p pRT RT\nE E\n\nzF p p zF p\n\n? ? ? ?\n= ? ?? ? ? ?? ? ? ?? ?  \n\n(2.41) \n\nTaking pressures in atmospheres, all the standard state pressures \nin the last term of equation (2.41) are 1, and this term is identically \nequal to zero. Substituting the values on the remaining equation we have \n\n \n\n2\n\n2 2\n\n2\n\n2 2\n\n1/ 2\n\n1/ 2\n\nln\n\n1.23 ln\n2\n\nH Oo\n\nH O\n\nH O\n\nH O\n\npRT\nE E\n\nzF p p\n\npRT\nE\n\nF p p\n\n? ?\n= ? ? ?? ?\n\n? ?\n\n? ?\n= ? ? ?? ?\n\n? ?\n\n  (2.42) \n\nWhen the denominator of the reaction quotient is smaller than the \nnumerator, the natural log term subtracts from the standard electrode \npotential, lowering the performance of the fuel cell. Therefore, diluting \nthe reactant gases will lower the maximum voltage that the cell can \nproduce. For instance, when a fuel cell operates on products of a fuel \nreforming reaction, the hydrogen may be diluted with carbon dioxide \nand nitrogen. Likewise, if air is used as the reactant, then the mole \nfraction of oxygen is lowered. \n\n2.2.1.6  Thermal and Second Law Efficiencies. \n\nFor a power producing device there are two definitions of \nconversion efficiency. The first is the thermal efficiency based on the \nfirst law of thermodynamics, comparing the net work output with the \nheat input (usually the heating value of the fuel). The second definition \nis based on the second law of thermodynamics, which compares the \n\n\n\n83 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nactual performance of a device to the maximum possible work that it \ncould produce. By using the concept of exergy, the second law is a \nmeasure of efficiency relative to the maximum work potential of the \nsystem. \n\nThe thermal efficiency \nth\n\n? of the heat engine is determined by the \namount of work the engine can perform with the thermal energy \nsupplied to the system \n\nnet\nth\n\nin\n\nW\n\nQ\n? =      (2.43) \n\nContrary to combustion systems, electrochemical cells, such as \nstorage batteries and fuel cells, operate at constant temperature. Because \nof this isothermal reaction, more of the chemical energy of the reactants \nis converted to electrical energy instead of being consumed to raise the \ntemperature of the products. Therefore, the electrochemical conversion \nprocess is less irreversible than the combustion reaction. As shown \nbefore, the maximum work for an electrochemical cell, ,e maxW , can be \n\nexpressed as a function of the electrical potential of the cell. Thus the \nfirst law efficiency for an electrochemical cell is  \n\n,\ncell\n\nth cell\n\nin\n\nW\n\nQ\n? =      (2.44) \n\nThe thermal energy supplied to the electrochemical cell can be \nrelated to the higher heating value of the fuel. Then, (HOOGER, 2003) \n\n,\nc\n\nth cell\n\nzFE\n\nHHV\n? =\n\n \n(2.45) \n\nwhere HHV is the higher heating value (per mol of fuel), z is the number \nof moles of electrons per mol of fuel and Ec is the output cell potential. \nThe maximum thermal efficiency of an electrochemical cell is given at \n\nthe standard cell potential\no\n\nE , the equilibrium condition in which no \ncurrent is being drawn from the cell. Then,  \n\n, ,max\n\no\ncell,max\n\nth cell\n\nW zFE\n\nHHV HHV\n? = =  (2.46) \n\nFor a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell, considering the standard \npotential at 25\u00b0C (where the water produced is in liquid form), the \nmaximum cell thermal efficiency is  \n\n\n\n84 \n\n,\n\n,\n\n2 96, 485 1.23\n\n141,880 2, 02\n\n0.83\n\ne\n\nf e\n\nth cell,max\n\nth cell,max\n\nmol C J\n\nmol mol C\n\nJ g\n\ng mol\n\n?\n\n?\n\n? ? ? ? ? ?\n\u00d7 \u00d7? ? ? ? ? ?? ?? ? ? ?? ?=\n\n? ? ? ?\n? ? ? ?? ?? ?\n\n=\n\n (2.47) \n\nThe inefficiency is attributed to the entropy generated from the \nchemical reaction. For a Carnot cycle heat engine to match this thermal \nefficiency, the higher temperature of the cycle would have to be 1480\u00b0C \n(with the low temperature being 25\u00b0C). \n\nThe second law efficiency ?2nd, of an energy conversion device \nindicates its degree of reversibility comparing the actual work against \nthe maximum work potential, \n\n2\nact\n\nnd\n\nrev\n\nW\n\nW\n? =     (2.48) \n\nAnother way to express this efficiency is in terms of the thermal \n\nefficiency,\nth\n\n? , comparing the actual work to the maximum work,  \n\n,\n2 ,\n\n, ,\n\nth cell\n\nnd cell\n\nth cell max\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n=    (2.49) \n\nFor fuel cells, using the thermal efficiencies in equation (2.45) \nand equation (2.46), the second law efficiency can be calculated in terms \nof the electrical potentials, \n\n2 ,\nc\n\nnd cell o\n\nE\n\nE\n? =     (2.50) \n\nThis efficiency compares the actual voltage to the maximum \nvoltage. Exergy is lost, dissipated as heat, because of the inefficiencies \nwithin the fuel cell. \n\n2.2.2 Electrode potential and interfacial phenomena \n\nIn this section, we discuss how the electrode potential across the \nfuel cell is formed. Most of electrochemistry depends on the processes \nthat occur at the interface between an electrode and an ionic solution. \nFuel cells follow the same general behavior as galvanic cells. The main \ndifference between the two devices is that in fuel cells both the \nelectrodes are separated by an electrolyte while in the case of galvanic \n\n\n\n85 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\ncells, the electrodes are located within the electrolytes in separated ionic \nsolutions.  \n\nAt the interface between any pair of conduction phases a potential \ndifference exists. Its magnitude is a function of both the composition \nand nature of the phase. The observed potentials are produced by the \nelectrical double layer. Its structure is responsible for many of the \nproperties of a given system. The double layer itself arises from an \nexcess of charges at the interface which may be ions, electrons or \noriented dipoles (CROW, 1994).  \n\nIn the following, the double layer phenomenon is first described \nfollowed by the description of the electrode potential produced. Later \nthe concept of electrochemical potential is discussed and finally the \nNernst equation is again obtained but, now, from the electrochemical \npotential of the involved ions.  \n\n2.2.2.1 Double Layer \n\nAt the interface between any pair of conduction phases a potential \ndifference exists. Its magnitude is a function of both the composition \nand nature of the phases. These observed potentials are produced by two \nparallel electrical layers known as double layer. This concept comes \nfrom the original simple view of an organized arrangement of positive \nions (solvate), originated from the solution, that organize themselves to \ncompensate the excess electrical charges at the interface, which may be \nions, electrons or oriented dipoles (CROW, 1994).  \n\nAs an example, we can take a metal immersed in a solution of \nions of the same metal, as shown in left side of Figure 17. A metal \nconsists of an ordered arrangement of positive nuclei surrounded by \nmobile electrons which occupy closely spaced levels. The level with the \nhighest energy is known as the Fermi level. When the metal is dipped \ninto the solution, surface equilibrium requires that the excess charge \nresiding on the electrode surface (free electrons) must be exactly \nbalanced by an equal charge of the opposite sign on the solution side. In \na clean metal surface, when seeking the electrical equilibrium, positive \ncharges from the solution (solvate) will align facing the metal. The line \ndrawn through the center of such cations at the situation of closest \napproach marks a boundary known as the Outer Helmholtz Plane (OHP) \nor surface, and the region inside this boundary is the double layer \n(CROW, 1994).  \n\nIn general, the surface of the metal is rarely clean. Ions, solvent \ndipoles and neutral molecules with or without dipole, as a result of \n\n\n\n86 \n\nCoulombic or van der Waals interaction, may be adsorbed on the metal \nelectrode surface (HAMANN, 1998). When only electrostatic \ninteraction forces operate (and depending on the characteristic of the \nsolution), cations from the solution phase are separated from the surface \nby a layer of solvent (anion or oriented water dipole molecules in the \nright side of Figure 17 ). Adsorption of anions by Van der Waals and \nCoulombic interaction gives rise to the existence of an inner Helmholtz \nplane.  \n\nBeyond the OHP a region is formed where the weaker \nelectrostatic forces and also the thermal motion avoid the order of the \nion groups. That region is the diffuse part of the double layer \n(HAMANN, 1998). The diffuse double layer may extend from less than \n1 nm to more than 10 nm. For solutions with higher ionic strength the \ndiffusion double layer can be neglected.  \n\nElectrically, the Helmholtz layer will behave as a capacitor with \nplate separation equal to the half of the diameter of the cation. Thus, the \nthickness of the double layer depends primarily on the ionic strength of \nthe solution.  \n\nFigure 17 \u2013 Rendering of the molecular structure of the double layer. \n\n \nThere are two general views of the arrangement of ions and \n\nelectric dipoles in the solution. In the Helmholtz model of the double \nlayer the solvated ions arrange themselves over the surface of the \nelectrode but are held away from it by their hydration spheres \n(ATKINS, 1998). This model is incomplete because it does not take into \naccount the thermal motion of the ions. In the Go\u00fcy-Chapman model of \n\n\n\n87 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nthe diffuse double layer, the disordering effect of thermal motion is \ntaken into account. It does not consider an inner Helmholtz layer at all, \nbut develops the idea of a diffuse layer consisting of ions of both \ncharges. Neither the Helmholtz nor the Go\u00fcy-Chapman models are a \nvery good representation of the structure of the double layer. The two \nare combined in the Stern model, in which the ions closest to the \nelectrode are constrained within a rigid Helmholtz plane while outside \nthat plane the ions are dispersed as in the Go\u00fcy -Chapman model \n(ATKINS, 1998)(BARD and FAULKNER, 1980). The description of \nthese more advanced models lies beyond the objectives of the present \nwork.  \n\n2.2.2.2  Electrode Potential \n\nIn this section, the transfer of electrons across the \nelectrode/solution interface is considered. The electrode reactions are \noxidation-reduction processes which obey the scheme \n\noxidant ze reductant\n?+ ?   (2.51) \n\nwhere ze- represents a transfer of z unit charges (electrons).  \nAs shown above, the global oxidation-reduction reaction \n\n1 2 1 2\nOx + Red Red Ox+?    (2.52) \n\nis formed of two individual half-reactions, \n\n1 1\nOx + ze Red\n\n?\n?\n\n \n(2.53) \n\n2 2\nRed Ox ze\n\n?+?     (2.54) \nWhen a metal is dipped into a solution of ions, as shown in \n\nFigure 17a, the interface between the two phases will reach equilibrium. \nThe driving force for equilibrium is the difference in electrochemical \npotential. Equilibrium will follow the electrochemical reaction  \n\nz\nM ze M\n\n+ ?+ ?    (2.55) \nwhere Mz+ represents the ions of the metal and M represents the metal.  \n\nDuring the process, electrical current flows between the two \nphases and once the surface reaches equilibrium no net electrical current \nremains. For many systems, equilibrium is established rapidly, which \nallows the potential difference to be measured easily by a potentiometer \ndevice. In other cases, the approach to equilibrium is slow, a \ncontinuously variable potential will be observed and no steady value \nmay be determined experimentally (CROW, 1994). The electrochemical \nreaction can either produce deposition of metal ions onto the metal or \n\n\n\n88 \n\ndissolution of metal ions into the solution according to the direction of \nthe electrochemical reaction.  \n\nThe literature usually describes the variation of potential in the \ninterface by a mental exercise in which the electrodes and corresponding \nelectrolyte are separated from one another but with the charge \ndistributions considered to be the same as when combined. It is then \npossible to imagine the influence on a positive test charge approaching \nthe metal from the solution side and passing through its surface. \nSimilarly, it is possible to imagine the charge coming from the electrode \nto the electrolyte solution. Figure 18 shows the potential variation that a \ntest charge would experiment as a function of the distance from a \nmetallic electrode that has been separated from the electrolyte solution: \nFigure 18(a) represents the energetic path of a charge approaching the \nmetal from the solution and Figure 18(b) represents the energetic path of \na charge leaving the metal to the solution.  \n\nFigure 18 - Variation of potential with distance from a metallic electrode:. \n\n \n(a) (b) \n\n(a) represents the energetic path of a charge approaching the metal from the \nsolution and (b) represents the energetic path of a charge leaving the metal to the \nsolution \n\nFar from the electrode, the test charge experiences a Coulomb \npotential that varies inversely with distance. In Figure 18a, as the test \ncharge approaches the electrode it enters a region where the potential \nhas a smaller variation. At about 100 nm from the surface the potential \nvaries only slightly with distance, and its value in this region is called \nthe Volta potential, or the outer potential, ?. As the test charge is taken \nthrough the skin of electrons on the surface of the metallic electrode, it \nexperiences a sharp variation of potential until the probe reaches the \ninner, bulk metal environment, where the potential is called Galvanic \npotential, ? . The difference between the Galvanic and Volta potential is \ncalled the surface potential, ? . Figure 18b represents the \n\n\n\n89 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\ncomplementary mental experiment for the electrode-to-solution journey. \nIt is clear that in general the Galvanic potential may be expressed by  \n\n? ? ?= +     (2.56) \nIn a real system (that is the metallic electrode and the solution \n\nbrought together), Volta potentials can be measured but not surface \npotentials. This means that galvanic potentials also cannot be measured. \nWhat can be measured is a value of ??  relative to a reference \n\nref\n?? , \n\nthat is the value of the electrode potential Ee. In summary, \n\ni) Electrode potential, Eel = g?? = M S? ?? , is expressed in terms of \nnon-measurable quantities, where the subscript M corresponds to \nthe metal electrode and the subscript S corresponds to the solution. \n\nii) A reference electrode potential Eref = ref??  may be defined, quite \narbitrarily, for convenience; \n\niii) The difference, Eel- Eref = g?? - ref?? , can be measured by \npotentiometric means. \n\nIf Eref is designated zero and is the common reference for all \nmeasurements of Eel-Eref, then it is possible to draw an internationally \nagreed series of values of Eel (CROW, 1994).  \n\nThe relation between Volta and Galvanic potential is better \nunderstood when both Figure 18(a) and Figure 18(b) are brought \ntogether as shown in Figure 19: Figure 19 (a) represents the two thought \nexperiments and Figure 19 (b) represents the total electric potential \ncurve. \n\nFigure 19 \u2013 Rendering of the electrical potentials in the electrode-electrolyte \ninterface: \n\n  \n(a) (b) \n\n(a) The electrical potentials for charges approaching from the metal and from the \nsolution sides and (b) the total electric potential curve. \n\n\n\n90 \n\nThe curve in Figure 19(b) basically shows a continuum variation \nof ?  from the solution to the metal and the existence of a surface phase \nexhibiting a step change in ? . \n\n2.2.2.3  The Electrochemical Potential for Ions \n\nThe presence of potential difference in the interface affects the \nchemical potential of the ions in equilibrium at the surface. A cation in a \nregion of positive potential has a higher chemical potential (is \nchemically more active in a thermodynamic sense) than when it is in a \nregion of zero potential. It is possible to incorporate this effect into the \nthermodynamic chemical potential by considering the work made by the \nelectrical field on the electrical charge. The contribution of an electric \npotential to the chemical potential is calculated by noting that the \nelectrical work of adding a charge ze- to a region where the potential is \n?  (the galvanic potential, that is the potential between two phases in \nequilibrium when no net current flows) is ze ? , and therefore the work \nper mol is zF? , where F is the Faraday constant. Because at constant \ntemperature and pressure the maximum electrical work can be identified \nwith the change in Gibbs energy, the difference in chemical potential of \nan ion with and without the electric potential present is zF? . The \nchemical potential of an ion in the presence of an electrical potential is \n\ncalled its electrochemical potential,\ni\n\n\u00b5 . From the definition of chemical \npotential,  \n\n, , j i\n\ni\n\ni p T n\n\nG\n\nn\n\u00b5\n\n?\n\n? ??\n= ? ?\n\n?? ?\n   (2.57) \n\nSince z electrons are produced per n moles of reactant consumed \nat the electrode,  \n\ni i i\nG G n zF?? =    (2.58) \n\nTherefore, the electric contribution to the chemical potential is  \n\ni i\nzF\u00b5 \u00b5 ?? =     (2.59) \n\nIn this expression, \ni\n\n\u00b5  is the chemical potential of the species \nwhen the electrical potential is zero. When z=0 (a neutral species), the \nelectrochemical potential is equal to the chemical potential. The \nelectrochemical potential can be finally expressed as  \n\nlno\ni i i\n\nRT a zF\u00b5 \u00b5 ?= + +    (2.60) \n\n\n\n91 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E.

The current density, under steady-state, is proportional to the \nhydrogen reaction rate at the anode. Starting with a simple redox \nreaction, the cell current density is obtained as a function of the \nelectrical potential in the electrode. Then, the theory of the activated \ncomplex is used to discuss the transfer coefficient. The Butler-Volmer \nequation, that expresses the current density as a function of the \nactivation losses, is derived. Finally the well-known Tafel equation is \nobtained. \n\n\n\n94 \n\n2.2.3.1 The Redox Reaction and Current Density \n\nIn the previous sections, only equilibrium conditions were \naddressed. On an electrode at equilibrium conditions, chemical reactions \nin both directions occur at equal rates, giving no net current from the \nelectrode. At this condition the theoretical maximum potential of the cell \nis obtained. In non-equilibrium conditions, a net current flow occurs \nwhich is a consequence of the development of the reaction in a preferred \ndirection.  \n\nIn a galvanic cell process, each of the half-reactions can be \nunderstood as two competing forward and backward reactions, one \nproducing the oxidation and the other producing the reduction of the \nelectrode, \n\nRed Ox ze\n?? +  (2.78) \n\nOx ze Red\n?+ ?  \n\n(2.79) \n\nFigure 20 shows a rendering of the pathway of the half reaction. \nHere, only the surface reaction mechanism is considered, which includes \ndiffusion controlled and chemical kinetic controlled steps. In this \nmechanism, reactant from the bulk solution diffuses through the Nernst \ndiffusion layer driven by mass concentration gradient. Upon reaching \nthe outer Helmholtz plane, the chemical reaction begins and an activated \ncomplex is produced. The activated complex adsorbs on the electrode \nsurface and the reaction proceeds to completion. The backward reaction \nproceeds in the same way. Since the electrode reaction is heterogeneous, \nit is natural to express its rate per unit time and area of the electrode \nsurface.  \n\n\n\n95 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nFigure 20 - Pathway of a general electrode reaction  \n\n \n(Adapted from Bard and Faulkner, 1980). \n\nIn the following, the simpler case of a one-step, global, first-order \nreaction is analyzed, leading to the Butler-Volmer equation.  \n\nDenoting the molar concentrations of the oxidized and reduced \nspecies outside the double layer as [Ox] and [Red] respectively, the rate \n\nof oxidation of Red in equation (2.78), \nred\n\nv , is  \n\n[ ]red oxv k Red=     (2.80) \nwhere kox is the rate constant (pseudo) for the oxidation reaction, and the \n\nrate of reduction of Ox in equation (2.79),\nox\n\nv , is  \n\n[ ]ox redv k Ox=     (2.81) \nwhere kred is the rate constant for the reduction reaction.  \n\nBoth, oxidation and reduction reactions occur on the same \nelectrode even if one direction is dominant. The net current density \n(current per unit of catalytic area i=I /A) at the electrode is the \ndifference between the current densities arising from the reduction of Ox \nand the oxidation of Red. Because the redox processes at the electrode \ninvolve the transfer of one electron per reaction event, the current \ndensities, i, arising from the redox processes are equal to the rates \nmultiplied by the charge transferred per mole of reaction, which is given \nby the Faraday constant. Therefore, there is a cathodic current density of \nmagnitude \n\n[ ]c redi Fk Ox=     (2.82) \narising from the reduction and there is an opposing anodic current \ndensity of magnitude \n\n\n\n96 \n\n[ ]a oxi Fk Red=     (2.83) \narising from the oxidation. The net current density at the electrode is the \ndifference  \n\na c\ni i i= ?      (2.84) \n\nor expressed as a function of the concentration \n\n[ ] [ ]ox redi Fk Red Fk Ox= ?  (2.85) \nThe rate constant ki can be obtained from the activated complex \n\ntheory as discussed below. \n\n2.2.3.2  Rate Constant - Activated Complex Theory \n\nThe activated complex theory (ATC) is an attempt to identify the \nmain features governing the magnitude of the rate constant in terms of a \nmodel of the events that take place during the reaction. \n\nFor two reactants A and B changing along a reaction coordinate, \nas the reaction event proceeds, A and B come into contact, distort, and \nbegin an exchange of discard atoms. The potential energy rises to a \nmaximum, and the cluster of atoms that corresponds to the region close \nto the maximum is called the activated complex as shown in Figure 21. \nIn the reaction profile, the horizontal axis is the reaction coordinate, and \nthe vertical axis is the potential energy. The activated complex is the \nregion near the potential maximum, and the transition state corresponds \nto the maximum itself. After the maximum, the potential energy falls as \nthe atoms rearrange in the cluster, until it reaches a value characteristic \nof the products.  \n\n\n\n97 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nFigure 21 - A reaction profile and  activated complex  \n\n \nThe climax of the reaction occurs at the peak of the potential \n\nenergy. There two reactant molecules have come to such a degree of \ncloseness and distortion that a small further distortion will send them in \nthe direction of products. This crucial configuration is called the \ntransition state of the reaction.  \n\nThe speed of the reaction involving A and B can be written as \n\nv [ ][ ]\nr\n\nk A B=     (2.86) \nHere, \n\nr\nk k K= ? ?\n\n \n(2.87) \n\nwhere k\n?\n\n is the unimolecular rate constant for transition reaction and \n\nK\n?\n\n is a proportionality constant, defined as follows. Activated complex \ntheory depicts a reaction between A and B as proceeding through the \n\nformation of an activated complex, C\n?\n\n, that falls apart by unimolecular \n\ndecay into products, P, with a rate constant k\n?\n\n \n\nvC P k C? ?? = ? ?\n? ? ?    (2.88) \n\nAn activated complex can form a product if it passes through the \ntransition state.

(2.89) \n\n\n\n98 \n\nwhere ? is the transmission coefficient (assumed to be about 1) and ?  \nis the frequency in which the cluster of atoms forming the complex \napproaches the transition state.  \n\nThe concentration of the activated complex is likely to be \nproportional to the concentration of the reactants, thus \n\n[ ][ ]C K A B? ? =? ?\n? ?\n\n \n(2.90) \n\nIt is assumed that a pre-equilibrium between the reactants and the \ncomplex exist, with equilibrium constant given by \n\n( / )\n\n( / )( / )\n\no o\n\nC C\n\no o\n\nA B A B\n\nA B C\n\np p p p\nK\n\np p p p p p\n\n+\n\n= =\n? ?\n\n?\n?\n\n   (2.91) \n\nThe partial pressure can be expressed as a function of the molar \nconcentration to obtain \n\n[ ][ ]\no\n\nRT\nC K A B\n\np\n? ? =? ?\n\n?\n\n \n\n(2.92) \n\nComparing equation (2.92) with equation (2.90) we conclude that \n\no\n\nRT\nK K\n\np\n=?

From here on, we will establish the relation between the \nelectrical current and the electrode potential, considering that both a \ncathodic and an anodic reaction occur on the same electrode. This can \nbe done by the Butler-Volmer equation which is valid when the \nelectrode reaction is controlled by electrical charge transfer at the \nelectrode (and not by the mass transfer to or from the electrode surface \nfrom or to the bulk electrolyte). First, it is necessary to describe the \nactivation Gibbs energy in terms of the electrical potential.   \n\n2.2.3.3  Activation Gibbs Energy in a Redox Reaction \n\nA species that participates in reduction or oxidation at an \nelectrode has to either migrate through the electrical double layer and \nadjust its hydration sphere as it receives or discards electrons, or detach \nand migrate into the bulk if it is already activated (see Figure 20). \nBecause both processes are activated, it is possible to express their rate \nconstants according to the activated complex theory (ATKINS, 1998). \nFor this, equation (2.103) is rewritten here as \n\nexp\nr o\n\nT RT G\nk\n\nh RTp\n?\n\n?? ?? ? ??\n= ? ?? ?\n\n? ? ? ?\n\nk\n  (2.104) \n\nwhere ?  is the transition coefficient, k  is the Boltzmann constant, T is \nthe temperature, hp is the Plank constant, R is the gas universal constant, \n\nG\n?? is the Gibbs energy of activation and po standard pressure. The \n\noxidation reduction reaction involves the existence of an activated \n\ncomplex C\n?\n\nthat has to pass through a transition state on the top of an \nenergy barrier as shown in Figure 22. For both directions of the reaction \nthere would be one Gibbs energy of activation, one for oxidation \n\n\n\n101 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\n(anodic) \nox\n\nG\n?? , and one for the reduction (cathodic) \n\nred\nG\n\n?? . Figure 22 \nrepresents the change in Gibbs energy that a species undergoes during \nthe oxidation-reduction reaction given by equation \n\nO\n\nR\nRed Ox ze\n\n?+\t\t?\t?\t\t\t . In the figure, the vertical axis accounts for the \n\nGibbs energy and the horizontal axis is the distance beginning in the \nelectrode crossing the double layer and reaching the outer Helmholtz \nplane. The figure on top represents the activation energy barrier and \nrelative positions of reactant, product and activated complex with \nrespect to distance from the electrode surface and OHP. The bottom part \npresents the complementary Gibbs energy parabolas for reactant ad \nproduct with crossing point at the transition state. It is assumed that the \nreaction occurs in this space near to the electrode, where the species has \n\nto overcome the energy barrier \nox\n\nG\n??  to become Ox while losing one \n\nelectron. The minimum of the parabolic curve on the right side of the \nbottom figure corresponds to the stable configuration of the species Red, \nwhile the minimum on the left curve on the same figure corresponds to \nthe stable configuration of the specie Ox. The intersection of the two \n\ncurves represents the transition state. \nM\n\n?  represents the electrode \npotential (Metal),which is the highest of the two, and \n\nS\n?  represents the \n\nelectrolyte potential (Solution). The horizontal axis can also be \nunderstood as the nuclear configuration (BREITER, 1969).  \n\nThe overall Gibbs energy change is given by  \n\nred ox\nG G G n F?? = ? ? ? = ?? ?   (2.105) \n\nwhere \nM S\n\n? ? ?? = ? . \n\n\n\n102 \n\nFigure 22 - Electrode reaction Gibbs energy profile for a reversible \nprocess.  \n\n \n\nUsing the definition of rate constant for the oxidation-reduction \nprocess at the electrode it is possible to express the current density of \nequation (2.85) as \n\n[ ]\n\n[ ]\n\nexp\n\nexp\n\nox\n\no\n\nA\n\nox\n\nred\n\no\n\nCt\n\nred\n\nGkT RT\ni F Red\n\nh p RT\n\nGkT RT\nF Ox\n\nh p RT\n\n?\n\n?\n\n? ?? ? ?\n= ? ?? ?? ?\n\n? ? ? ?\n\n? ?? ? ?\n?? ?? ?\n\n? ? ? ?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n???????????\n\n?????????????\n\n \n(2.106) \n\nBecause electrochemical reactions occur in the presence of an \nelectric field, the Gibbs energy of activation must include both chemical \n\n\n\n103 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nand electrical terms. Likewise, it is important to find an expression that \ndescribes how the electric current on an electrode depends on the \nelectrode potential, considering that both cathodic and anodic reactions \noccur on the same electrode. Figure 23 shows three Gibbs energy \nprofiles for the oxidation reaction. The reaction is assumed as having \nred as reactant and ox as product, that is, oxidized on the electrode and \nreduced in the electrolyte ( ox\n\nred\nRed Ox ze\n\n?+\t\t\t??\t\t\t ). The black dashed line \n\nis the reaction profile without the influence of the electrical field \npotential and the green line is the same profile with the electrical field \neffect. In Figure 23(a), a situation in which the transition state of the \nactivated complex is reactant-like (the peak of the Gibbs energy profile \nis close to the electrode) is shown. For the reduction reaction (going \nfrom the electrolyte to the electrode ?), a cathodic current is generated \n\nand the cathodic activation Gibbs energy is changed from ( )0CtG?\n?\n\n to \n\n( )0Ct CtG G F ?? = ? + ?\n? ?\n\n. Here the cathodic activation Gibbs energy is \n\nincreased. Thus if the electrode is more positive than the \nsolution, 0?? > , then more work has to be done to form an activated \ncomplex from Ox. In Figure 23b a situation in which the transition state \nis product-like (the peak of the Gibbs energy profile is close to the \nOHP) is shown.  \n\n\n\n104 \n\nFigure 23 - Reaction profiles for the oxidation reduction reaction. \n\nFor the reduction reaction (?), the cathodic activation Gibbs \n\nenergy ( )0CtG?\n?\n\n is independent of ?? . \nIn a real system, the transition state has an intermediate \n\nresemblance to these extremes, Figure 23 c, and the cathodic activation \nGibbs energy for reduction may be written as \n\n( )0Ct CtG G F? ?? = ? + ?\n? ?\n\n   (2.107) \n\nThe parameter ? is called the (cathodic) transfer coefficient. In \ntheory, it varies between zero and one, depending on the symmetry of \nthe transition in the electrochemical reaction. Value ?=0 favors \nreduction and value ?=1 favors oxidation. Experimentally is has been \ndetermined to be about 0.5 (HOOGERS, 2003). \n\nThe same analysis on Figure 23(c), can be made for the oxidation \nreaction (the process goes from the electrode to the electrolyte while \ndiscarding an electron to the electrode ?). In this case an anodic current \nis generated. If the transition state is reactant-like, Figure 23(c),(a), the \nextra work is zero. In cases where the transition state is product-like, \nFigure 23 (c), (b), the extra work is the full F ?? ? . In general the \nactivation Gibbs energy for this anodic process is \n\n( ) ( )0 1A AG G F? ?? = ? ? ? ?\n? ?\n\n  (2.108) \n\n\n\n105 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nTo summarize, when the transition state resembles species that \nhas undergone reduction (Figure 23 c, a), the activation Gibbs energy \nfor the anodic current is almost unchanged, but the full effect applies to \nthe cathodic current. When the transition state resembles a species that \nhas undergone oxidation (Figure 23 c, b), the cathodic current activation \nGibbs energy is almost unchanged but the anodic current activation \nGibbs energy is strongly affected. When the transition state is \nintermediate in its resemblance to reduced and oxidized species, both \nactivation Gibbs energies are affected.  \n\nThe two activation Gibbs energies can now be inserted in the \nelectrical current equation (2.106),  \n\n[ ]\n( ) ( )\n\n[ ]\n( )\n\n0 1\nexp\n\n0\nexp\n\nA\n\no\n\nA\n\nCt\n\no\n\nCt\n\nG FkT RT\ni F Red\n\nh RTp\n\nG FkT RT\nF Ox\n\nh RTp\n\n? ?\n?\n\n? ?\n?\n\n? ?? ? ? ?? ?\n= ? ?? ?? ? ? ?? ? ? ?\n\n? ?? + ?? ?\n?? ?? ? ? ?? ? ? ?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n   (2.109) \n\nThese expressions, in order to evidence the chemical and \nelectrical characteristics, can also be expressed as \n\n[ ]\n( ) ( )\n\n[ ]\n( )\n\n0 1\nexp exp\n\n0\nexp exp\n\nA\n\no\n\nA\n\nCt\n\no\n\nCt\n\nG FkT RT\ni F Red\n\nh RT RTp\n\nGkT RT F\nF Ox\n\nh RT RTp\n\n? ?\n?\n\n? ?\n?\n\n? ?? ? ?? ?? ?\n= ? ?? ? ? ?? ? ? ?? ? ? ?? ?\n\n? ??? ? ?? ?\n? ?? ?? ? ? ?? ? ? ?? ? ? ?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n   (2.110) \n\n2.2.3.4  The Butler-Volmer Equation \n\nIf the cell is balanced against an external potential that is equal \nand opposite to the cell potential then it is possible to obtain a dynamic \nequilibrium where no net current is obtained from the cell.

The difference in potential is \ncalled the overpotential, ? (under the current condition it corresponds to \nthe activation overpotential) \n\nc\nE E? = ?  (2.112) \n\nWhen assuming only activation resistances to the electrochemical \nprocess, only activation overpotential will be present. For the hydrogen \noxygen fuel cell, the reversible potential of the anode, where hydrogen \noxidation occurs, is 0 V. For the oxygen reduction reaction at the \ncathode, the reversible potential is +1.23 V at 25oC. In an operating fuel \ncell, the activation overpotential of the anode is positive, which means \nthe electrode potential is higher than 0 V. For the cathode, the electrode \npotential is below 1.23 V, which means the overpotential is negative \n(HOOGERS, 2003). \n\nSubstituting the overpotential definition given by equation \n(2.112) in the current cell definition, equation (2.111) for a working cell, \nwe have \n\n[ ]\n( ) ( ) ( )\n\n[ ]\n( )\n\n0 1 1\nexp exp exp\n\n0\nexp exp exp\n\nA c\n\no\n\nA\n\nCt c\n\no\n\nCt\n\nG FE FkT RT\ni F Red\n\nh p RT RT RT\n\nG FEkT RT F\nF Ox\n\nh p RT RT RT\n\n? ? ?\n?\n\n? ? ?\n?\n\n? ?? ? ?? ? ? ?? ?\n= ? ?? ? ? ? ? ?? ?\n\n? ? ? ? ? ?? ?\n\n? ??? ? ? ? ? ?\n? ? ?? ?? ? ? ?? ?\n\n? ?? ?? ? ? ?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n  (2.113) \n\nAll the terms except for the rightmost exponent can be \nconsolidated into a constant for both of the directions.  \n\n[ ]\n( ) ( ) ( )\n\n[ ]\n( )\n\n,\n\n,\n\n0 1 1\nexp exp exp\n\n0\nexp exp exp\n\no A\n\no Ct\n\nA c\n\no\n\nA\n\nk\n\nCt c\n\no\n\nCt\n\nk\n\nG FE FkT RT\ni F Red\n\nh p RT RT RT\n\nG FEkT RT F\nF Ox\n\nh p RT RT RT\n\n? ? ?\n?\n\n? ? ?\n?\n\n? ?? ? ?? ? ? ?? ?\n= ? ?? ? ? ? ? ?? ?\n\n? ? ? ? ? ?? ?\n\n? ??? ? ? ? ? ?\n? ? ?? ?? ? ? ?? ?\n\n? ?? ?? ? ? ?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?????????????????????\n\n???????????????????\n\n  (2.114) \n\nthen defining these pre-exponential constants of the current density \ndefinition, \n\n( ) ( )\n,\n\n0 1\nexp expa c\n\no A o\n\nA\n\nG FEkT RT\nk\n\nh p RT RT\n\n?\n?\n\n? ?? ?? ?? ?\n= ?? ? ? ?? ?\n\n? ? ? ?? ?\n\n?\n\n (2.115) \n\n( )\n,\n\n0\nexp exp\n\nc c\n\no Ct o\n\nCt\n\nG FEkT RT\nk\n\nh RT RTp\n\n?\n?\n\n? ??? ? ? ?\n= ? ?? ?? ? ? ?? ? ? ?? ? ? ?\n\n?\n\n (2.116) \n\nwe have \n\n\n\n107 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L.

Since \nequilibrium applies, the bulk concentrations of Red and Ox are also \nfound on the surface. Although no net current flow out of the fuel cell, \nthe dynamic characteristic of the equilibrium state allows the presence \nof an internal current that flows equally in both directions. That current \nis defined as the exchange current density, io. \n\n[ ] [ ], ,o A o Ct oF Red k F Ox k i= ?   (2.118) \nThe exchange current density incorporates the kinetic term that \n\nincludes the chemical portion of the electrochemical Gibbs energy of \nactivation. Because of this, it can be used as a comparison between \ndifferent catalysts: the smaller the activation energy, the larger the \nexchange current density and the better the catalyst (HOOGERS, 2003). \nExchange currents are generally large when the redox process involves \nno bond breaking or if only weak bonds are broken. They are generally \nsmall when more than one electron needs to be transferred, or when \nmultiple or strong bonds are broken. A few values of the exchange \ncurrent are shown in  Table 5 exchange current and transfer coefficients \nat 298K (ATKINS, 1998 ). \n\nAfter substituting the exchange current density in the current \ndensity equation, its final form result is the so called Butler-Volmer \nequation. \n\n( )1\nexp exp\n\no\n\nF F\ni i\n\nRT RT\n\n? ? ? ?? ??? ? ? ?\n= ? ?? ?? ? ? ?\n\n? ?? ?? ?? ?\n (2.119) \n\nThis equation is the general description of an electrochemical \nreaction, containing both reduction (left term) and oxidation (right term) \ncomponents (Hoogers, 2003). This equation only strictly holds in the \nabove form for process involving a single electron. When \nelectrochemical reactions involving more than one electron are \nconsidered, more rigorous analysis is require to use different \ncoefficients instead of ? and (1-?), because their sum may not be one (1) \nanymore.

The exchange current density io is a direct measure \nof the electrode reaction rate; a high value means that the reaction \nproceeds reversibly (BLOMEN and MUGERWA 1993).  \n\n2.2.3.5  Tafel Equation \n\nIn contrast with the anode reaction, the oxygen reduction reaction \nat the cathode is an activated process and therefore exhibits a much \nhigher overpotential (HOOGERS, 2003). The plot of the logarithm of \nthe current density against the overpotential in equation (2.121) is called \na Tafel plot.

E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\n2.2.4 Overpotential and polarization curve \n\nAs explained in the sections above, the origin of the reversible \nelectrical work delivered in an electrochemical reaction is the Gibbs \nenergy delivered from the fuel cell by an exergonic reaction. Thus \nnegative reaction Gibbs free energy produces positive potential \ndifference between the electrodes spontaneously, whereas reaction with \npositive reaction Gibbs free energy would need an external potential to \noccur. The EpErCd curve in Figure 24 is used here to explain this \nconcept.  \n\nEpErCd is a three orthogonal axes curve that shows the variation \nof the electrical potential difference developed at the electrical contacts \nE (V), as a function of the extent of reaction ?  and the current density i \n(A/cm2). On plane E- ? , the Gibbs energy as a function of the extent of \nreaction is also shown, proving the region of spontaneous reaction (?rG \n&lt;0) and the condition for electrochemical equilibrium (?rG = 0) whose \ncorresponding electrical potential difference is nil. On the same plane, \nbut on an arbitrary different scale, the standard cell potential Eo is \nrelated to the derivate of the reaction Gibbs energy and draws a straight \nline with negative slope. Along the current density i (A/cm2) axis, the \npotential diminishes as current increases while conserving the same \nextent of reaction position. Parallel to plane E-I, and in the adequate \nextent of reaction, the polarization curve will appear. Figure 24 shows \nthe EpErCd general curve for any general electrochemical reaction.  \n\n\n\n110 \n\nFigure 24 Rendering of a typical potential surface in a fuel cell as a \nfunction of the extent of reaction and the current density, the EpErCd \n\ncurve. \n\n \n\nThe electric potential follows the standard cell potential as long \nas the current is zero, i.e., no net current exists - therefore no power \nwould be delivered. For a given specific composition (represented by \nthe extent of reaction) a net current can be generated, being represented \nas the two curved lines parallel to the axis that represents the current, i.  \nOnce a current flows, there is a progressive decrease in the cell\u2019s \nelectrical potential difference because of the working potential losses as \nthe current increases. \n\nFigure 25 shows a rendering of the relation between the extent of \nreaction, electrical potential and current density as three orthogonal \naxes. The hydrogen-oxygen curve in Figure 25 is located in the \nstoichiometric point on the extent of reaction axis, for which the \nstandard cell potential with liquid water production is 1.229 V at 298\u00b0C. \nUnder power demand, a unitary cell can deliver from 0.6 to 0.7 V, for \ncurrent density that varies according to fuel cell and fuel between 0.15 \nto 1.0 A/cm2 (LINARDI, 2010). The highest potential in a fuel cell for a \ndefined extent of reaction and temperature is the standard cell \n\npotential\no\n\nE . It is defined at standard pressure and, according to the \n\n\n\n111 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\ntemperature; the state of the water produced can be different. The \n\ntheoretical cell potential E is the standard potential \no\n\nE  reduced by the \neffect of the change in partial pressure of reactants or products, the \ndouble layer activation and the crossover phenomenon. The open circuit \nvoltage OCV is the measured potential difference between terminals in \nthe open circuit of an idling cell. Irreversibilities of the OCV were \nanalyzed by Arato and Costa (2006a). \n\nFigure 25 - Relation among fuel cell potential E (V), extent of reaction \nand current density i(A/cm2).  \n\n \n\nThe OCV usually does not reach the value of the theoretical cell \npotential E at the given temperature and partial pressures, because of the \nparasitic electrochemical process that occurs next to the main two \nreactions. Some voltage loss at open circuit voltage is due to the \ncrossover of some hydrogen through the membrane electrolyte to the \ncathode; also, corrosion processes might take place, depending on the \ncomposition of the electrodes. Finally, the cell potential Ec that is the \nmeasured potential during a fuel cell operation depends on the current \ndensity i (A/cm2). The polarization curve describes the relation between \nthe potential and the current density as will be shown later.  \n\nTable 4 shows the values for the standard reaction Gibbs energy \nand standard cell potential for the case of a hydrogen-oxygen cell. \nEfficiency limits based on HHV are also shown.  \n\n\n\n112 \n\nTable 4 - Standard reaction Gibbs energy and standard cell potential for \ndifferent temperatures. \n\nTemperature \u00b0C \no\n\nr\nG?  \n\n(kJ/mol) \no\n\nE at po V , ,th cell max?  \nState of the \nwater produced \n\n25 -237.2 1.23 83 Liquid \n80 -228.2 1.18 80 Liquid \n100 -225.2 1.17 79 Gas \n200 -220.4 1.14 77 Gas \n400 -210.3 1.09 74 Gas \n600 -199.6 1.04 70 Gas \n800 -188.6 0.98 66 Gas \n1000 -177.4 0.92 62 Gas \nLarminie and Dicks, 2003  \n\nWhen a current is established in the system the potential decays \nand as current increases more losses diminish the delivered tension of \nthe cell. Now the phenomena which cause this tension loss or \noverpotentials are described. \n\nUseful amounts of work are obtained from a fuel cell only when a \nreasonably large current is drawn. The overpotentials are potential \nlosses in the fuel cell under the condition of delivering current. Different \nnames are used for the same variable according to the point of view of \nthe scientific field. According to the electrochemists, they are also \ncalled, polarization, irreversibilities (thermodynamic point of view), \nlosses (so vague) and voltage drop (not a very scientifically precise \nterm) (LARMINIE and DICKS, 2003). Indifferently of the general name \noverpotentials receive, they are classified according to their nature. The \nmost significant overpotentials are the activation, concentration, and the \nohmic, but the literature also describes other overpotentials, such as \ncrossover, reaction and transfer.  \n\nIn the following, the overpotentials are described and the simpler \nsemi-empirical models, usually linear, are reviewed. This modeling \nallows bringing together the entire phenomenology of equilibrium, \nreaction, charge and species transport. These simpler models will also \nbe used in the next chapter in a basic lumped-model to assess the main \noperation characteristics and macroscopic properties of a PEM fuel cell.  \n\n2.2.4.1 Activation overpotential \n\nThis overpotential is caused due to the fact that the reactions \n(transferring of electrons) taking place on the surface of the electrodes \nhave a limited speed. The limitations commonly considered are those \nwhich typically can be influenced by applying an \u201cactivation catalyst\u201d. \n\n\n\n113 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nTemperature usually has a large influence on this type of overpotential \n(KORDESCH and SIMADER, 1996). One expression for overpotential \ncan be obtained by taking the Tafel equation and considering activation \nas unique effect. By defining a coefficient A  \n\n2.3RT\nA\n\nz F?\n= ?      (2.125) \n\nit is possible to obtain a simple expression for the activation \noverpotential \n\nlog\no\n\ni\nA\n\ni\n?\n\n? ?\n= ? ?\n\n? ?\n     (2.126) \n\nFigure 26 shows a typical pattern of a Tafel plots. It is observed \nthat for most of the values of overvoltage, the graph approximates to a \nstraight line (LARMINIE and DICKS, 2003). The coefficient A is the \nslope of the Tafel plot. It is higher for an electrochemical reaction that is \nslow. For the oxygen reduction reaction (z=2) in a practical fuel cell, A \nis usually between 40 and 80 mV. \n\nFigure 26 - Tafel plots for slow and fast electrochemical reaction  \n\n \n(from Larminie and Dicks, (2003)) \n\nFor a real cell working, this overpotential is identified as the \nactivation overpotential, which expressed in natural logarithm is  \n\n\n\n114 \n\nlna\n\no\n\nRT i\n\nz F i\n?\n\n?\n? ?\n\n= ? ?\n? ?\n\n    (2.127) \n\nThe main factor controlling the activation overpotential and \nhence the cell potential, Ec, is the exchange current density io. From \nequation (2.123) it can be seen that a tenfold increase in io leads to an \nincrease in the cell potential of typically 60 mV. While the Tafel slope A \nis dictated by the chemical reaction (and temperature), the value for io \ndepends on reaction kinetics. Thus, it is supposed that the magnitude of \nio can be increased by adding more electrocatalyst to the cathode \n(HOOGERS, 2003). Figure 27 shows the effect of the io on the cell \npotential when only activation overvoltage are considered as a loss. \nCurves for values of io equal to 0.01, 1.0, 100 (mA/cm\n\n2) using a typical \nvalue for A of 0.06V were plotted. From there, it can be seen that the \nsmaller the io, the greater the voltage drop.  \n\nFigure 27 \u2013 Typical curves of cell voltage against current density.  \n\n \n(from Larminie and Dicks, (2003)) \n\nIt is worth recalling that io at the oxygen electrode (cathode) is \nmuch smaller than that at the hydrogen anode, sometimes 105 times \nsmaller. For a low temperature, hydrogen-fed fuel cell running on air at \nambient pressure, a typical value of io would be about 0.1mA/cm\n\n2 at the \ncathode and about 200mA/cm2 at the anode (LARMINIE and DICKS, \n\n\n\n115 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\n2003). Experimental values of the Butler-Volmer parameters for the \nhydrogen formation on some electrodes are shown in Table 5. \n\n \n \n\nTable 5 - Exchange current and transfer coefficients at 298K (ATKINS, \n1998). \n\nReaction Electrode io  [A/cm\n2] ? \n\n22 2H e H\n+ ?+ ?  \n\nPt 7.9\u00d710-4  \nCu 1\u00d710-4  \nNi 6.3\u00d710-4 0.58 \nHg 7.9\u00d710-4 0.50 \nPb 5.0\u00d710-4  \n\nDue to the relevant effect the exchange current density has on \nreducing the activation overvoltage, it is desirable to increase its value, \nespecially at the cathode. Some ways to increase the io are as follows \n(LARMINIE and DICKS, 2003): \n\n\u2022 Raising the cell temperature. For a low-temperature cell, io at the \ncathode will be about 0.1m/Acm-2, whereas for a typical 800\u00b0C \ncell, it will be about 10m/Acm-2, a 100-fold improvement, \n\n\u2022 Using more effective catalyst, \n\n\u2022 Increasing the interfacial surface area of the electrodes, \n\n\u2022 Increasing reactant concentration (using O2 instead of air), \n\n\u2022 Increasing the pressure. \n\n2.2.4.2 Ohmic overpotential (Ohmic resistance).  \n\nThis overpotential has no correlation with any chemical process \nat the electrodes and is the straightforward resistance to the flow of \nelectrical charge through the different material in the fuel cell. This \nresistance involves the electron Ohmic resistance of the conductors \n(metals, carbon including cell stack components, and interface contact \nresistances) and the resistance of the ionic conductors (electrolyte and \ncatalyst layers) which, under certain assumptions, can be modeled by \nthe same linear dependence with the current density (Ohm\u2019s law) but are \nbased on ion-mobility characteristics. The total resistance controls the \nslope of the pseudo-linear middle portion of the polarization curve, \nregion II in Figure 29, the larger the resistance, the faster the drop of the \npolarization curve with increasing current density (HOOGERS, 2003). \n\n\n\n116 \n\nThe speed of charge transfer by electron flow compared with \nionic flow is about 100:1. This difference is important for electrolyte \nreactions, which always occur on the interfaces between conductors and \nelectrolytes. If the electrodes are porous, the supply of ions and the \ncharge transfer is usually the limiting process (KORDESCH and \nSIMADER, 1996). Electronically, a fuel cell can be regarded as a series \ncircuit of an ideal voltage source and a total internal resistance that is the \ncombination of the electronic resistances of various fuel cell \ncomponents (ohmic losses occur during transport of electrons and ions). \nThe higher the current flow, the larger the ohmic voltages drop across \nthe sum of all internal resistance inside the fuel cell. Ohmic correction \nby numerical fitting is made on the data to analyze the fuel cell \ncurrent/voltage curve in order to separate the different effects on the \nperformance (HOOGERS, 2003). Ohmic overpotential can be expressed \nby the simple expression \n\no\ncell\n\niR? =     (2.128) \nWhere Rcell is the total resistance of the fuel cell and is the most \n\ndifficult variable to obtain because of the wide range of dependent \nvariable. \n\n2.2.4.3  Mass transport or concentration overpotential \n(Nernstian). \n\nThese overpotentials result from the change in concentration of \nthe reactants at the surface of the electrodes as the fuel is used. The lack \nof reactant is caused by diffusion processes (pressure gradient, changes \nin the usage rates of gases or liquid). The delay in reaching steady state \nconditions, or the absence of equilibrium conditions as a result of the \ncurrent flow using up or producing materials, are sources of \nconcentration difference. Other parameters are, for examples, the \nporosity of materials which influence the gas or liquid flow, or the \npermeability of membranes changing the ionic flow (KORDESCH and \nSIMADER, 1996). One of the assumptions in the derivation of the \nButler-Volmer equation is the negligible conversion of the electroactive \nspecies at low current densities, resulting in uniformity of concentration \nnear to the electrode. This assumption fails at high current density \nbecause the consumption of electroactive species close to the electrode \nresults in a concentration gradient. Diffusion of the species toward the \nelectrode from the bulk is slow and may become rate-determining. Part \nof the electric potential will be used to overcome that situation \n\n\n\n117 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E.

(2.129) \n\nwhere Kr (activities relation for a general reaction) has been substituted \nfor a (activity of the ions in the solution). Now, assuming there is a large \nexcess of support electrolyte so as to keep the mean activity coefficient \n? , approximately constant and expressing this activity as a function of \nthe local concentration we can write \n\n0\n\nln lno\n\nE\n\nRT RT\nE E c\n\nzF zF\n?= + +\n\n???????\n\n    (2.130) \n\nTherefore, the constant activity coefficient is included into E, \nand we write the formal potential, E0 of the electrode as \n\n0 lno\nRT\n\nE E\nzF\n\n?= +     (2.131) \n\nThe theoretical cell potential is then expressed as a function of \nthe formal potential as: \n\n0 ln\nRT\n\nE E c\nzF\n\n= +     (2.132) \n\nWhen the cell is producing current, the active ion concentration \nat the OHP changes to c\u00b4, see Figure 28, then the electrode potential \nchanges to \n\n0' ln '\nRT\n\nE E c\nzF\n\n= +     (2.133) \n\nIn a simple model of the Nernst diffusion layer there is a linear \nvariation in concentration between the bulk and the outer Helmholtz \nplane; the thickness of the layer depends strongly on the state of flow of \nthe fluid.

This Nernst diffusion layer (about 100 \n\u00b5m, and strongly dependent on the conditions of the hydrodynamics due \n\n\n\n118 \n\nto any stirring or convective effects) has a thickness quite different from \nthat of the electrical double layer (which is typically less than 1 nm, and \nunaffected by stirring). \n\nFigure 28 -  Linear variation in concentration on the model of the Nernst \ndiffusion layer. \n\n \n\nThe molar flux J is proportional to the concentration gradient, \nand, using a simple integrated form of Fick\u2019s law, that flux is \napproximated as \n\n'\nim\n\nc c\nJ D\n\n?\n?\n\n=      (2.135) \n\nwhere Dim is the diffusivity of species i in the mixture.

Another important case is at the air cathode, if the air supply \nis not well circulated.  \n\n2.2.4.4 Other Overpotentials \n\nOther overpotentials are identified but are not as relevant or their \neffect can be included in one of those discussed above . They are: \n\n2.2.4.4.1 Fuel crossover and internal current overpotential \n\nElectrolytes should only transport ions; however, a certain \namount of fuel diffusion and electron flow will always be possible. The \ncrossover is the overpotential resulting from that phenomena where not \nonly the waste of fuel passing through the electrolyte but also the \nopposite potential caused when it reacts on the cathode, contribute to the \npotential drop (LARMINIE and DICKS, 2003). \n\n \n \n\n\n\n120 \n\n2.2.4.4.2 Reaction overpotential. \n\nThis is a term for the voltage difference appearing when an \nearlier or simultaneous (related) chemical reaction produces another \ncompound which changes the operating conditions. \n\n2.2.4.4.3 Transfer overpotential. \n\nThis is unfortunately used vaguely in many connections and \nshould be limited to the description of the change in potential under load \nconditions as fundamental interrelation of current and potential. \n\nOther effects such as the poison of the catalyst or membrane can \naffect the fuel cells performance generating an \u201coverpotential\u201d. This is \nthe situation when using reformer as a fuel for the fuel cell. If the \nreformate of any hydrocarbons is not efficient it can contain compost \nlike CO which can poison the catalytic layer and the membrane \n\n2.2.4.5 Polarization Curve \n\nThe polarization curve of a fuel cell is the curve defined by the \ncell potential Ec as a function of the current density. Before the \nproduction of any net current density, the potential presents a sharp drop \nfrom the theoretical cell potential E to the open circuit voltage OCV. \nThe causes of these drops remain when the current is drawn from the \ncell. As the current increases, the potential drops progressively as a \nconsequence of the overpotentials. Figure 29 shows a sketch of a typical \npolarization curve where the vertical axis represents the cell potential in \nvolts and the horizontal axis represents the current density delivered \nfrom the cell. The cumulative contribution of the main overpotential can \nbe observed along the current density. The Lilac strip represents the \nactivation overpotential of the cathode, the orange strip represents the \nohmic overpotential, the pink strip represents the activation \noverpotential of the anode, the blue strip represents the mass transport \noverpotential and the green area is the net cell potential and its \nboundary, represented by the black line is the result of the standard cell \npotential (horizontal limit at approximately 1.23 V) diminished by the \ntotal of the overpotential in any current density . \n\n\n\n121 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nFigure 29 - Typical polarization curve for a PEM fuel cell  \n\nThe polarization curve can be divided in three regimes according \nto the preponderant overpotential in each one (see Figure 29). The three \nregimes shown are: (I) the activation limited regime, (II) the resistance \nlimited regime and (III) the mass transport limited regime. In regime I, \n(the activation limited regime) at low current density, the shape of the \npolarization curve is governed by the charge transfer at the electrode \ninterface and reproduced by the activation overpotential. This \noverpotential represents the magnitude of activation energies when \nreactions propagate at the rate required by the current and depends on \nthe type of reactions and catalyst materials, electrode microstructure, \nreactant activities, electrolyte material (acidic/alkaline), temperature and \ncurrent density. \n\nAfter the rapid drop of the activation overpotential, a second \nregime, the resistance limited regime, begins where the cell potential \nexhibits a pseudo-linear behavior as the current density increases. In this \nregion, the shape of the curve is governed by the ohmic overpotential, \nwhich arises from the electrical resistance of fuel cell conductor. Bulk \nmaterials and interfaces between components display an intrinsic \nresistance to electron flow, and electrolyte materials offer resistance to \ntransportation of ions, which carry the current in the electrolyte phase. \nThe magnitude of ohmic overpotential is proportional to current and cell \nresistance. Resistance of rigid bulk material depends mainly on material \nproperties, but bulk conductivity of pliable materials and contact \nresistance are also affected by surface properties and contact pressure \nbetween the components. Electrolyte conductivity depends primarily on \n\n\n\n122 \n\ntemperature and for most PEM electrolyte types, water content. The \nlargest single contributor to cell resistance is usually the electrolyte \nresistance to ionic current. At the end of the pseudo-linear region, \nregime III, the mass transport limited regime, begins. In this region, the \nshape of the curve is determined by the mass transfer overpotential. \nWhen current density reaches a certain level, sluggishness of mass \ntransfer processes starts to limit the supply of reactants to the electrodes, \nand cell voltage begins to decrease rapidly with increasing current \ndemand, reaching the limit current density. Mass transfer overpotential \ncan be viewed as an activation energy required to drive mass transfer at \nthe rate needed to support the current. \n\nPrediction of the polarization curve is not easy due to the fact that \nboth concentrations and different overpotentials are not constant \neverywhere on the electrode surface. Local variations in temperature; \nreactant flow velocity and concentration in the flow channel; layer \ntransport properties (material porosity, pore size distribution, \npermeability, thickness, presence of inert species etc.); humidity \nconditions; and so on have an effect on the reactant concentration on the \nelectrode surface and magnitude of overpotentials. Therefore, an \naccurate description of fuel cell polarization must take into account both \nlocal variations in operating conditions and species transport by \nconvection and multicomponent diffusion. If liquid water is present, \nmass transport in both phases should be considered (MIKKOLA, 2007). \n\n2.2.5  A Simple Mathematical Expression for the Polarization \nCurve \n\nAuthors have proposed semi-empirical models that can be \nanalytical and global, or numerical and local, which have a considerably \ncomplex level. However, it is useful to construct a simple semi-\nempirical mathematical equation that allows one to estimate the \npotential curve. the fuel cells potential can be expressed as the \ntheoretical potential at a pressure and a temperature established, \ndiminished of the main overpotentials \n\na o c\n\nc\nE E ? ? ?= ? ? ?

E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nKim et al. (1995) and Laurencelle et al. (2001) have proposed one \nexpression similar to equation (2.142) but with the concentration \noverpotential changed to a simpler empirical equation as \n\nln exp( )\nc cell E i\n\no\n\nRT i\nE E iR A B i\n\nz F i?\n? ?\n\n= ? ? ?? ?\n? ?\n\n  (2.143) \n\nThen, they collapse the theoretical potential e and the constant \npart of the activation overpotential into one term to obtain  \n\n( ) ( )ln ln exp( )c o cell E i\nOVC\n\nRT RT\nE E i i iR A B i\n\nz F z F? ?\n= + ? ? ?\n???????\n\n (2.144) \n\nThe new term is the real, practical, open circuit voltage OCV, \ngiven by \n\n( )ln o\nRT\n\nOCV E i\nz F?\n\n= +    (2.145) \n\nDue to the tiny value of io, the OCV will always be less than E. \nFinally we have the expression \n\n( )ln exp( )c cell E i\nRT\n\nE OCV i iR A B i\nz F?\n\n= ? ? ?\n \n\n(2.146) \n\nThis equation has been found to provide a reasonable curve fit to \nthe result of a real fuel cell. However, the logarithmic part of the model \ndoes not work well at very low currents (LARMINIE and DICKS, \n2003). \n\nWith the definition of potential as a function of the overpotential \nit is also possible to establish an expression for the electrical power \ndensity of the fuel cell. \n\nFuel cells electrical power density is given by  \n\nc\nP iE=      (2.147) \n\nTable 6 presents some values of the constants for equation \n(2.146). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n124 \n\nTable 6 - Values for the semi- empirical cell potential equation. \nConstant Ballard Mark V PEMFC at \n\n70\u00b0C \nOCV (V) 1.031 \n\ncell\nR\n\n(k?cm2) 2.45\u00d710\n-3 \n\nRT\n\nn F?

(2.148) \n\nThe first term on the right hand side is the ideal power that the \nfuel cell would produce just before beginning the net current production. \nThe second term accounts for the power necessary to overcome the \nremaining activation losses as the net current increases. The third term is \nthe power used to overcome the resistance during the transport of the \nelectrical charges and is dissipated as heat. The last term is the power \nemployed to allow the transport of the chemical species to the catalytic \nsurface in order to react. \n\nFigure 30 represents the electrical power density as the black line \nthat surrounds the orange light area. As current increases, the cell \npotential decreases while the power increases in the first two regimes, \nreaching the highest position in regime III where the cell current \ncollapses due to the concentration overpotential and a rapid drop in \npower is observed.  \n\n\n\n125 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nFigure 30 - Sketch of the polarization curve with the electrical power \ndensity curve. \n\n \n\nGenerally, high power is required by end users. According to the \nfigure, high power means lower voltage and, taking in to account that \nefficiency and voltages are directly proportional it can be affirmed that \nhigh power performance of fuel cell involves low efficiency due to the \npoor electrochemical conversion on this working range. So, when high \nefficiency is necessary as in stationary applications, fuel cell has to \noperate above 0.8 to 0.9 V, and even for applications where power is \nmore important than efficiency, high value of voltage is required \n(HOOGERS, 2003). \n\nThe discussion and models presented so far provide the basic \nframework to the theoretical description of the operation of hydrogen \nPEM fuel cells. The models that will be developed in the later chapters \nwill complete this view by providing a more thorough treatment of the \ndifferent mass transports. In order to assess the state of the art in the fuel \ncell modeling, in the following sections the many models available in \nthe literature are reviewed and critically discussed.  \n\n\n\n126 \n\n2.3 REVIEW OF THE MODELS FOR PEM FUEL CELLS  \n\nIn a general way, the first purpose of the modeling is to predict \nthe performance of a PEM fuel cell (predicting the polarization curve). \nThe second purpose is to provide insight into the processes within the \nfuel cell.  \n\nComplex electrochemical processes, mass, heat and energy \ntransport make the experimental activities with fuel cells a challenging \nactivity. This difficulty in experimental measurements summing to the \neconomical restriction as well as the time consumption in the \nconstructive process of the fuel cell turns computational simulation, as \nin most of the engineering areas, into an indispensable tool for \nimproving the technology on fuel cells.  \n\nBesides addressing the technological advances with their well-\nknown results, modeling and simulation have become the predominant \ntools for better understanding and optimization (BASCHUK, 2006). \nComputational modeling makes it possible to investigate complex \ngeometries and different situations by spending less time and effort than \nexperimental investigation. Many difficulties have been faced in the \nconstruction of a complete computational model for fuel cell stacks \ncombining all the phenomena. In the same way, availability of \nexperimental data (and modeling) is very restricted and idealized \nsituations are frequently assumed (BIYIKOGLU, 2005).  \n\nSome of the most important uses of mathematical fuel cell \nmodels are: To help to understand the internal physics and chemistry of \nfuel cells; to focus experimental development efforts; to support system \ndesign and optimization; to support or form the basis of control \nalgorithms; to evaluate the technical and economic suitability of fuel \ncell applications. Models also help with the understanding of the effect \nof parameters on the fuel cells performance (U.S. DOE, 2004b). \n\n2.3.1 General Classifications of the Fuel Cell Models  \n\nClassification of simulation is not straightforward and in most \ncases the boundaries are not well defined. Some criteria commonly used \nto classify the model are the origin of the equations (empirical or \nphenomenological), its physical scope (part of the fuel cell, the whole \ncell or the system including peripheral devices) or complexity level. \nSome variables like number of dimensions, operation regime (dynamic \nor steady-state), king of electrode kinetic expression used (simple Tafel \ntype expression, Butler-volmer- type expression, complex multistep \n\n\n\n127 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nreaction kinetics), phases (gas phase, gas- liquid phase), mas transport \nmechanism in different layers (Fick law, Nernst-Planck expression with \nDarcy\u2019s law or Schlogl\u2019s formulation for convective flow) and energy \nbalance (isothermal or non-isothermal approaches) can also be useful for \nclassification. \n\n2.3.1.1 Empirical and Phenomenological Models  \n\nThe classification by the origin of the equations looks to be the \nmost general. Empirical models concerned with predicting PEM fuel \ncell performance with a single, algebraic equation. They are effective at \npredicting performance, but provide little insight into the processes \noccurring within PEM fuel cell (BASCHUK, 2006). Models that employ \nartificial neural network (ANN) are examples of empirical models but \ndespite the matches with experimental results, these models are only \nvalid for the specific cell or stack for which the experimental data were \nobtained and for the range of operating conditions at which the \nexperiment was performed. This makes these models limited in scope \n(WISHART, 2008). \n\nPhenomenological models, on the other hand, can consider both, \ninternal local behavior condition and overall cell performance. These \ninternal details include mass, momentum, and energy transport in the \ngaseous reactant and liquid water of the gas flow channel, GDL\u00b4s, \ncatalysts layer, and polymer electrolyte membrane. These processes can \nbe described, by fundamental conservation laws, subject to assumptions \nsuch as idealizations of the physical structures or the relative importance \nof some of them. Additionally, a distinction should be made between \nmicro-scale and macro-scale models. In micro-scale models, transport \nphenomena are modeled at the molecular level. Nevertheless this scale \nof modeling is impractical for entire PEM fuel cells, since the number of \nmolecules that can be modeled using the molecular dynamics (MD) \nmethod are limited. Thus molecular iterations are represented by \nquantities such as diffusion coefficients in macro \u2013scale models to make \nthe entire fuel cell simulation possible (BASCHUK, 2006). \n\n2.3.1.2  MEA-Center and Channel-Center Approaches \n\nClassification according to the physical scope is applied to \nmacro-scale phenomenological models by Baschuk (2006). According \nto the author, there is a first group where the processes occurring within \nthe MEA are modeled in detail, while the flow in the gas flow channels \nis either ignored or characterized by a boundary condition. A second \n\n\n\n128 \n\ngroup of models directs their efforts to modeling the flow in the gas \nflow channels using techniques of Computational Fluid Dynamics \n(CFD). The MEA-centered approach (first group) predated the channel-\ncenter approach (second group) and as a result the channel-centered \napproach used many of the equations of the MEA-center approach. \n\n2.3.2  Level of Complexity of the Model \n\nClassification of the mathematical models according to the \ncomplexity of the model was presented in the Fuel Cell Handbook (U. \nS. DOE, 2004b). The author affirms that according to the application of \nthe model, it should have a specific requirement with respect to the level \nof detail and rigor. For higher level applications the predictive \nrequirements are modest, on the other side of the spectrum, models \nintended to improve understanding of complex physical and chemical \nphenomena or to optimize cell geometries and flow patterns that are \nnecessarily very sophisticated, and usually have intensive computational \nrequirements (U. S. DOE, 2004b). Those characteristics give origin to a \ndifferent fuel cell model. If it is true that the constitutive equations \nremain in all models, it is also true that their level of detail, level of \naggregation, and numerical implementation methods vary widely. The \noutput of the more detailed fundamental models can be used in lower-\norder models. This flow of information is, in fact, a critical application \nfor high fidelity models. Much work has been done in the development \nof algorithms to integrate or embed high-fidelity models into system \nanalysis simulation tools. Much of the data on fuel cell performance \nreported in the literature is, while phenomenologically often interesting, \ninsufficiently accurate and accompanied by far too little detail on the \ntest conditions to be usable for model validation (U. S. DOE, 2004b). \nAccording to Wishart (2008) there is a lack of comprehensive fuel cell \nstack models. This absence of a fully-developed stack model should be \naddressed in order to obtain accurate modeling results that can be \nempirically validated. \n\nFigure 31 shows a sketch representing the flow of information \nfrom the more complex model (at the bottom of the figure) to the higher \nlevel application (at the top of the figure), where relatively simple \nmodels are satisfactory and appropriate. These different levels of \ninformation are then briefly described. \n\n\n\n129 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E.

One well-known type of value-in-use \nmodel is the well-to-wheels analysis, in which the energy consumption, \nenvironmental impact, and sometimes cost of different transportation \noptions are compared to consider all steps from the primary resource to \nthe vehicle. One example of this model is the Argon National \nLaboratories\u2019 GREET model (WANG, 2001). A critical subset of value-\nin-use models is that used to help establish the manufacturing cost of \nfuel cells. These models typically consider the individual processing \nsteps required to produce particular cell and stack geometries at a given \nproduction volume (U. S. DOE, 2004b).  \n\n\n\n130 \n\n2.3.2.2  Application Models  \n\nFuel cell application models are used to assess the interactions \nbetween the fuel cell power system and the application environment. \nThe most common use is in vehicle applications where the dynamic \ninteractions between the power system and the vehicle are too complex \nto analyze without the help of a mathematical model. Some commercial \nfuel cell models and software modules are available, such as Emmeskay \n(LMS, 2008), ADVISOR 2002 from the National Renewable Energy \nLaboratory, General Computational Toolkit (CGTool) from Argonne \nNational Laboratory \u2013ANL (ANL, 2008), the fuel cell modules in Easy \n5 from Ricardo, and FEMLAB from COMSOL. More commercial \nmodels are being developed, especially multi-dimensional models. For \nexample, Ansoft Corporation and Synopsys (formerly Avant!) will make \nPEM fuel cell system models available in the near future, and Fluent and \nCD ADAPCO Group have recently released CFD PEM fuel cell \npackages (CD-ADAPCO, 2008). Other available programs include \nGamma Technologies\u2019 GT Power, and MSC Software\u2019s MSC.EASY5. \nThe first ADVISOR is written in MathWorks MATLAB and Simulink. \nThe second ADVISOR 2002 fuel cell system model has a similar \napproach except that its fuel cell performance is based on a polarization \ncurve, the associated fuel use per cell, and the number of individual cells \nwithin the stack. One drawback of the two ADVISOR 2002 models is \nthat thermal and water management is not included. A more detailed \nfuel cell model is provided in the Chemical Engineering Module of \nFEMLAB. FEMLAB uses the MathWorks simulation code MATLAB \n(U. S. DOE, 2004b). \n\n2.3.2.3  Thermodynamic System Models  \n\nMost fuel cell models are based on thermodynamic process flow \nsimulators such as Aspen Plus (DOE\u00b4s National Energy Technology \nLaboratory), HYSIS (U. S. DOE, 2004a), GCTool (Argonne National \nLaboratory) and ChemCAD. This kind of model has an intrinsic \nobjective of helping in the understanding of the interactions between \nvarious unit operations within a fuel cell system. They are used \nroutinely by fuel cell developers, and have become an indispensable tool \nfor system engineers. The accuracy of the basic thermodynamic models \nis quite good, but because the fuel cell sub-models are typically lumped \nparameter models or simply look-up tables, their accuracy depends \nheavily on model parameters that have been developed and validated for \nrelevant situations. Stand-alone fuel cell power systems have been \n\n\n\n131 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\ninvestigated, as well as hybrid systems using a wide variety of fuels and \nprocess configurations (U. S. DOE, 2004b). \n\n2.3.2.4  3-D Cell / Stack Models  \n\nThese models are mainly used to evaluate different cell and stack \ngeometries and to help to understand the impact of stack operating \nconditions on fuel cell stack performance. It is almost impossible to \ninfer kinetic data without spatially resolved data on current density, \ntemperature and species concentrations. Given the wide range of \npossible stack geometries and the wide range of operating parameters \nthat influence stack operation, optimization of stack design under \nspecific application requirements is difficult without the help of a model \nthat represents the key physico-chemical characteristics of stacks. At a \nminimum, the models must represent electrochemical reactions, ionic \nand electronic conduction, and heat and mass transfer within the cell. \n\nMost of these models rely on existing modeling platforms such as \nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) \u2013 based Fuel Cell Codes. These \nare based on commercial CFD codes (e.g. StarCD, Fluent (FLUENT, \n2008), AEA Technologies\u2019 CFX, COMSOL (COMSOL, 2008)) that \nhave been adapted in order to regard the electrochemical reactions and \nelectronic and ionic conduction. In many cases, refinements in the \ntreatment of catalytic chemical reactions and flow through porous media \nare also incorporated to represent various electrode processes.  \n\nComputational Structural Analysis \u2013 based codes are based on \npublicly or commercially available 3-dimensional structural analysis \ncodes (e.g. ANSYS, Nastran, Abacus). Having similar adaptation as \nthose CFD-based codes (ionic conduction, fluid flow, and \nelectrochemical and chemical reactions) they do not provide as much \ninsight into the impact of complex flows as the CFD-based codes. \nComputational Structural Analysis are usually more efficient (run faster) \nthan CFD-based codes and can be used to assess mechanical stresses in \nthe stack; a key issue in some of the high-temperature fuel cell \ntechnologies. \n\nThree-dimensional CFD models can address critical issues such \nas temperature profiles and fuel utilization; important considerations in \nfuel cell development. CFD analysis computes local fluid velocity, \npressure, and temperature throughout the region of interest for problems \nwith complex geometries and boundary conditions. By coupling the \nCFD-predicted fluid flow behavior with the electrochemistry and \naccompanying thermodynamics, detailed predictions are possible. \n\n\n\n132 \n\nImproved knowledge of temperature and flow conditions at all points in \nthe fuel cell lead to improved design and performance of the unit. Some \nexamples of these models are the National Energy Technology \nLaboratory model (NETL\u2019s model) and Fluent. Other CFD used as a \nbasis for fuel cell model are the ABACUS, StarCD, MARC and \nCOMSOL. \n\nComputational fuel cell dynamics (CFCD) simulation model are \nused to efficiently attack difficulties related to the flow of the reactants \nand products, chemical reaction, and hydrodynamic behavior of the fluid \ninside the different layer that compounds the fuel cell (WISHART, \n2008). These models are based on the iterative solution of the \nconservation equation of mass, momentum, energy and chemical \nspecies. Their performance facing the complicated behavior of the fuel \ncell can overcome the other models, however, as in all mechanistic fuel \ncell models, the scope of the CFCD simulation models is often very \nlimited, and it is difficult to arrive at an assessment of the performance \nof the fuel cell as a whole, let alone an entire fuel cell stack. Some \ndrawbacks with these models are the requirement of powerful computers \nand the mesh dimension. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) \nsoftware Fluent has been used to develop some interesting models. Li \nand Becker (2004), have developed a three-dimensional PEM fuel cell \nmodel that includes multiple phenomena. Sivertsen and Djilali (2005), \nhave developed a single-phase, three-dimensional, non-isothermal \nCFCD model that takes the distributed overpotential in the catalyst layer \nof the cathode into account and keeps the heat sources and sinks \nseparate for each electrode. \n\n2.3.2.5  One-dimension Cell Models  \n\nThese models regard the more critical phenomena of the fuel cell \nand are indispensable for constructing the 3-D cell models. They are \nalso highly useful in interpreting and planning button cell experiments. \nVariables considered on this model involve transport phenomena such \nas: Convective mass transport of reactants and products to/from the \nsurface of the electrodes; Mass transport of reactants and products \nthrough the porous electrodes; Conduction of electronic current through \nthe electrodes and current collectors; Conduction of ions through the \nelectrolyte and electrodes (where applicable); Conduction, convection, \nand radiation of heat throughout the cell, and chemical reactions \n(Electrochemical reactions at or near the triple phase boundary); Internal \nreforming and shift reactions taking place inside the anode. \n\n\n\n133 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\n2.3.2.6  Electrode Models  \n\nThese models look to reproduce the local phenomenology \noccurring on the electrode surface. They are the fundamental models \nfrom which the others are constructed. One can distinguish four levels \nof electrode models:  \n\na) Continuum electrode approach. These models consider the electrode \nas a homogeneous zone for diffusion, electrochemical reaction and \nion and electron conduction. Using this model it is impossible to \ndistinguish between rate-determining steps in the electrochemically \nactive zone but it is possible to evaluate the importance of the mass \ntransfer versus kinetic processes. \n\nb) Multi-particle approach. These models are similar to the continuum \nelectrode approach but with some modifications which allow them \nto recognize that electrodes are typically made up of many particles \nthat have different phases. \n\nc) Local current density distribution approach is a refinement on the \nmulti-particle approach. It considers that current-densities are not \nnecessarily homogeneous within the particles, which can strongly \nimpact electrode resistance. \n\nd) Micro-kinetics approach. In this approach the individual reaction \nsteps at or near the triple phase boundary are considered. Although \nanalytical solution (in Butler-Volmer form) can be found, generally \na numerical solution is necessary for multi-step reaction. This \napproach can be embedded in the multi-particle of local-current \ndensity approaches, or directly used in a 1-D model. This is the \nonly approach that can give insight into the rate-determining \nelectrochemical processes that takes place in the fuel cell. \n\n2.3.3  Other Classifications \n\nAccording to Biyikoglu (2005) until 2005 most of the efforts in \nmodeling had been pointed to the water profile inside the PEM fuel cell, \nparticularly in the membrane; modeling of air cathode losses, and \nintegrated modeling of the combined losses in the cell. On the other \nhand the CFD modeling of PEM fuel cell includes the flow in the gas \nchannel and the influence of convection in the gas diffuser. The models \nconsider phenomena that include mass, momentum, and energy \ntransport through gas channel, electric current transport to porous media \nand electrochemical reaction at the catalyst layer. The author presents a \nclassification and comparison of experimental and numerical studies \nwhich consider modeling of process in the membrane, modeling of \n\n\n\n134 \n\nelectrode losses, membrane models, CFD modeling and interdigitated \nflow field.  \n\nHaraldsson (2004) proposes interesting key features for model \nevaluation. These features are summarized in Figure 32. In this option \nthe first four characteristics stand out, these are applied on some of the \nmost well-known references by the author according to Figure 33. Using \nthis classification, the author proposes distinctions according to the \norigin of the model, whether it is semi-empirical based on experimental \ndata specific to each application, or theoretical (mechanistic), which is \nbased on electrochemical, thermodynamic and sometimes fluid dynamic \nrelationships. \n\nFigure 32 - Key features of fuel cell models according to Haraldsson (2004). \n\n \nFor learning objectives, theoretical models are more \n\nrecommended. They use phenomenological equations such as the \nNernst-Planck equation for species transport, the Stefan-Maxwell \nequation for gas-phase transport and the Buter-Volmer equation for cell \npotential. The main problems these models face is the time for \ndevelopment and the difficulty in validation. The state of the model \nrefers to steady-state or transient. Although fuel cell response is \nimmediate, other parts of the system cannot respond so rapidly, which is \nwhy transient analysis are relevant to fuel cell systems. The system \nboundary refers to the identification of the domain of the simulation. It \ncan be the MEA, the total fuel cell or fuel cell system which includes \nother devices like more cells (stacks), compressors, and reformers. \n\n\n\n135 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nSpatial dimension and complexity are also important criteria and are \nstrongly related. Complexity of the model is associated with the amount \nof phenomena that it takes into account. A zero-dimension model has a \nsmaller degree of complexity and can be used in the case of initial \nsystem optimization. Transport phenomena description obliges the use \nof at least one dimension. More complex models address the proper \ntreatment of the thermal and water management through the use of \nelectrochemical and thermodynamic relations with the transport \nequations for flow, energy, mass and charge transfer (HARALDSSON, \n2004). The author also presents a comparison between two specific \nzero-dimensional models based on MATLAB/Simulink with open \nsource, the Virginia Tech model and the Royal Institute of Technology \n(KTH) model  \n\n2.3.4 Review of Theoretical Fundamental Works \n\nThe objective of this section is to review the formulation mainly \nof the pioneer mathematical models available in the literature. The \nliterature is vast and later a shorter and more objective description of the \nfeatures of the different models will be attempted. \n\nAs a methodology for comparison and evaluation we propose in \nTable 7 some groups of research that have working in the beginning of \nfuel cell modeling approaches. \n\nAfter a brief description in chronological order of the more \nrelevant models is done, indicating the main features of every one.  \n\nFinally it is find a table that resumes most of the pioneer works \nand group doing a comparative organization. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n136 \n\nFigure 33 - Overview of the fuel cell models available in literature and \ncommercially according to Haraldsson (2004). \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n137 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L.

Mishra. \n\nYang and Pitchumani, 2006 \n\n \n\n\n\n140 \n\nMost of the transport model for MEA in the literature are based \non two pioneering models, the Bernardi and Verbrugge (1991 and \n1992), and the Springer et al. (1991 and 1993) models. These two \nmodels were proposed as one-dimensional, steady-state and isothermal \nmodels. While species transport was assumed to be one-dimensional \nthrough the MEA, the flow channels were considered to be one-\ndimensional along the channel with a uniform flow velocity distribution \n(a plug flow). The most important feature of these models is the \ntreatment of mass and charge transfer across the membrane, along with \na treatment of the membrane water content. \n\nThe model of Bernardi and Verbrugge (1991 and 1992) focuses \non cell polarization characteristics, water transport, and catalyst \nutilization. They used only the conservation of mass of species equation \nto describe the concentration distribution along the direction of the main \nflow in the channels, and no pressure drop was assumed. This flow was \nanalyzed in order to obtain the average concentration of the reaction \nalong the flow channel and then these values were used as a boundary \ncondition at the interface channel-GDL. The GDL was assumed \nisotropic and both gaseous reactant and liquid water were assumed to \nexist in the pore regions, each one was assumed as traveling in separate \npore networks. No pressure drop was considered in the gaseous phase \nand the only transport mechanism assumed was the diffusive flux \nsimulated by the Stefan- Maxwell equation. In the liquid phase, \nconservation of mass and momentum using Darcy\u2019s law were \nconsidered. The electron migration in the GDL was modeled using \nOhm\u2019s law. The membrane was assumed as a porous network of \nchannels filled with liquid water and H+ ions. The liquid water transport \nwas described by the mass and momentum conservation equations. The \nmomentum equation was modeled as Darcy\u2019s law including a body \nforce term proportional to the gradient of electric potential. The \nconservation of mass of charge species was modeled with a diffusive \nflux proportional to concentration and electric potential gradient (called \na Nernst \u2013 Planck equation). They assumed a fully hydrated membrane \nwhich resulted in a constant H+ concentration through the membrane, \nallowing ion transport only by electric potential gradient. The catalyst \nlayer was assumed to be a porous media containing polymer electrolyte \nin the void regions. They used measured hydraulic permeabilities for \nboth membrane and electrodes. Unlike the polymer of the membrane, \nthis polymer embedded in the catalyst layer allows the diffusion of \nreactant gas, that\u2019s diffusional flux was described by Fick\u2019s law. The \nredox reaction at anode and cathode was modeled by using the Butler-\n\n\n\n141 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nVolmer equation. The conservation equations are written for each layer \nof the MEA, coupled with boundary conditions and solved using the \nNewton-Raphson method. The restriction in the reactant access due to \nthe presence of the liquid water was not modeled and this effect on the \npolarization curve could not therefore be simulated.  \n\nSpringer et al. (1991 and 1993) used detailed, experimentally \nderived diffusion and electroosmotic drag coefficient of water in \nNafion\u00ae in a model for steady-state water migration along the \nmembrane. They modeled the conservation of water mass in the \nmembrane using a diffusion flux with two laws. The first is a Fick\u2019s law \nbased on the gradient of concentration and the other is a flux of H+ ions \nmultiplied by an osmotic-drag coefficient. The diffusional velocity of \nthe H+ ions was assumed to depend on the electric potential gradient. \nThe electrical conductivity of the membrane is related, to the potential \nthrough Ohm\u2019s law and it was allowed to be variable as well as a \nfunction of membrane hydration. In turn, the membrane hydration was \nmodeled as a function of the relative humidity of the gas mixture by an \nequilibrium condition established experimentally (a liquid/vapor \nequilibrium condition). The electroosmotic coefficient is linearly \ndependent of the water content. Although the channels and GDL were \nmodeled as in Bernardi and Verbrugge (1991 and 1992), the catalyst \nlayer was simplified by assuming an infinitely fast electrochemical \nreaction occurring on the surface (sharp) of the GDL-Membrane \ninterface. Thus, the coupling of mass transfer, electron and proton \nmigration, and electro-chemical reactions within the catalyst layer was \nincluded as a boundary condition. Another difference between both \nmodels is that Springer et al (1991 and 1993) developed a way of \nsimulating the concentration overpotential by conditioning the GDL \nporosity with the current density. The first work disregards the flow of \nliquid water through the electrodes, and the effects of such flow through \nthe electrodes and membrane. \n\nIn the above one-dimensional models, the flow in the channel and \nGDL was always solved separately. Because of that condition, it was not \nconsidered an important interaction in the interface channel-GDL like \nthat of dragging of the water coming from GDL by convection \nphenomenon of air in the channel, and the depletion of reactant along \nthe channel. \n\nThis delicate interaction was modeled by Fuller and Newman \n(1993) in a one dimensional MEA model that coupled the flow channels \nand MEA along the channel. They applied the concentrated-solution \ntheory and employed limited earlier literature data on transport \n\n\n\n142 \n\nproperties to produce a general description of water transport in fuel cell \nmembranes. The results emphasize water distribution within the \nmembrane. Similar to Bernardi and Verbrugge (1991 and 1992), the \nmodel assumed that there was no pressure drop in the PEM fuel cell, \nand the transport of species was assumed to occur only by diffusion  \n(using a Stefan-Maxwell formulation) in the GDL and catalyst layer.  \n\nNguyen and White (1993) developed a quasi-two-dimensional, \nPEM fuel cell model that accounted for the gas channel by assuming a \nplug flow and linear concentration distribution in the channel. The \ninfluence of the liquid water content on the ionic conductivity and the \nenthalpy change due to phase change is taken into account, but the \ntemperature is considered constant in the solid materials and heat \ntransfer by conduction in the gas phase is neglected. Water \nconcentration, temperature, partial pressures and current density profiles \nalong the flow channels, voltage losses due to oxygen reaction and cell \nperformances are presented (BIYIKOGLU, 2005). The water and heat \nmanagement model used to investigate the effectiveness of various \nhumidification designs, was similar to that of Fuller and Newman \n(1993), except that the membrane was modeled using the variable \nhydration model of Springer et al. (1991 and 1993) and the catalyst layer \nwas considered to be at the interface. The results showed the necessity \nof anode humidification to avoid the ohmic loss in high current \ndensities. This work was modified by Yi and Nguyen (1998) who \ndeveloped an along-the-channel model with an improved description of \nthe heat transfer processes. They further refined the energy transport \nanalysis by allowing the bipolar plate, MEA, and the gas within the \nchannel to have different temperatures. They included the convective \nwater transport across the membrane by a pressure gradient, temperature \ndistribution in the solid phase along the flow channel, and heat removal \nby a natural convection and co-flow and counter-flow heat exchangers. \nResults show that the performance of a PEM fuel cell could be \nimproved by anode humidification and positive differential pressure \nbetween the cathode and the anode to increase the back transport rate of \nwater across the membrane. Results also show that effective heat \nremoval is necessary for preventing membrane dehydration. \n\nAmplhett et. al. (95a and 95b) developed parametric model for \npredicting the performance of a PEM fuel cell by using a combination of \nmechanistic and empirical modeling techniques. The model was applied \nto a Ballard Mark IV FC system. In the mechanistic model, mass \ntransport was modeled by a Maxwell-Stefan, the thermodynamics \nequilibrium by the Nernst equation , activation loss  by Tafel equation,  \n\n\n\n143 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\ninternal resistances by a Nernst Planck equation, and the uses the ohms \nlaw for the ohmic overpotentials. The empirical model allows to obtain \nthe parametric coefficients to predict with accuracy the performance of \nthe fuel cell in the parameters range evaluated. \n\nMore recent models included the solution of the flow and mass \ntransfer in the gas distribution channels using CFD techniques. These \ninclude the works developed at the University of Miami, Pennsylvania \nState University, and University of South Carolina. \n\nGurau et al. (1998), from University of Miami, developed a \nsingle-phase, two-dimensional model that included the channels, GDL, \ncatalyst layer, and membrane. The mathematical model was based on \nthe conservation equations of mass, momentum, species and energy in \neach layer. They were written such as to have the same form, differing \nonly on the source terms. The water transport in the membrane was \nmodeled by a generalized Darcy equation. Current flow was modeled \nwith Ohm\u2019s law, and the electrical conductivity was allowed to vary \nwith membrane hydration using the conductivity model of Springer et \nal. (1991, 1993). The diffusional flux of each species was modeled with \nFick\u2019s law, and the temperature of the solid and gas phases were \nassumed to be the same (local thermal equilibrium). The results showed \na non-linear oxygen mole fraction distribution along the flow channel \ndirection, which is different from previous linear assumption in pseudo-\n2D models such as Nguyen and White (1993). They also obtained the \noxygen and water concentrations in the gas channel and gas diffuser and \nstudied the influences of some parameters including porosity, \ntemperature, and fluid velocity on the fuel cell performances. This \nmodel was later complemented by a  \n\nThe advantages of the use of interdigitated flow field were \ndiscussed by Wood et al. (1998). They investigated the effectiveness of \nthe direct liquid water injection scheme and the interdigitated flow field \ndesign towards providing adequate gas humidification to maintain \nmembrane optimal hydration and mitigating the mass transport \nlimitations of the reactants and electrode flooding. They found that \nliquid water injection when used with the interdigitated flow field \ndesign is an extremely effective water management scheme. Kazim et \nal. (1999) proposed a simple single-component model and found that the \ninterdigitated flow field can increase both the limiting current density \nand maximum power density. The multi-component model by Yi and \nNguyen (1999) found that the higher gas flow rate improves the \nelectrode performance only when the diffusion layer is thinner. \n\n\n\n144 \n\nAnother way of coupling the MEA and flow in channels is by \nmodeling the MEA in a multi-dimensional manner and simulating any \nvariation along the channel as a boundary condition at the channel-MEA \ninterface. Singh et al. (1999) developed a two-dimensional model \nconsisting of the GDL, catalyst layer and membrane, using the same \napproach as Bernardi and Verbrugge (1991, 1992). The model takes into \naccount diffusion of the humidified fuel (H2, CO2 and H2O(v)) and \noxidant gases (O2, N2 and H2O(v)) through the porous electrodes, and \nconvective and electro-osmotic transport of liquid water in the \nelectrodes and the membrane. The thermodynamic equilibrium potential \nis calculated using the Nernst equation. Reaction kinetics are determined \nusing the Butler\u2013Volmer equation. A finite volume procedure is \ndeveloped to solve the system of differential equations. The model is \nvalidated against available experimental data, and numerical simulations \nare presented for various 1D and 2D isothermal cases. The results \nindicate that the cathode potential loss, associated with the slow O2 \nreaction rate, is dominant at all practical current densities. The \nsimulations also show that two-dimensionality has a significant effect on \nwater management and on some aspects of fuel cell performance. In \nparticular, the anode and cathode water fluxes are found to vary \nconsiderably along the oxidant and fuel flow channels, and two new \ntransitional water transport regimes are revealed by the 2D simulations. \nThe influences of flow configuration and electrode porosity on predicted \ncell performance are also discussed. this study was similar to that \npresented by Kazim et al. (1999) who applied the conservation of mass, \nmomentum and species to the GDL. The conservation of momentum \nwas assumed to take the form of Darcy\u2019s law, and the catalyst layer was \nassumed to be a surface.  \n\nThe research group in the University of South Carolina began \ntheir approach with the three-dimensional, single phase model of \nShimpalee et al. (1999). They considered the situation of steady state in \na straight channel and focused their attention on the heat transfer. The \nisothermal three dimensional model was implemented in a commercial \nCFD software (FLUENT), and included channels and MEA. The \ngeneralized Darcy\u2019s law was used for the conservation of momentum \nequation in the GDL and Fick\u2019s law accounted for the diffusive flux. \nThe membrane model of Springer et al. (1991, 1993) was used for the \ncurrent flow and water transport in the membrane. The conservation of \nenergy was added in Shimpalee and Dutta et al. (2000). \n\nThe group from Pennsylvania State University developed a two-\nphase, two-dimensional model of the cathode gas flow channel and \n\n\n\n145 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nGDL using the Multiphase Mixture Model (MMM) presenting the \nresults in Wang C.Y. and Cheng, (1997). There the catalyst layer was \ntreated as a sharp surface, and modeled with a jump condition. The \nconservation equation of mass was solved as well as momentum and \nspecies for the liquid and gas phases. The conservation of momentum in \nthe cathode GDL was in the form of Darcy\u00b4s law, and through algebraic \nmanipulations, the flux of liquid water was found as a function of the \ncapillary pressure and gravitation body force. The capillary pressure, in \nturn, was modeled as a function of the saturation, or volume fraction of \nliquid water in the electrode backing void space. Thus, although the \nconservation equations were solved for different values of velocity, \npressure, and concentration, the values for each phase could be \ndetermined with algebraic relationships \n\nIn 2000s multi-dimensional models based on the continuum \napproach and solving a complete set of conservation equation \n(continuity, Navier-Stokes, Energy) coupled with electrochemical \nreaction were broadly developed. \n\nA complete mathematical model is presented by Baschuk and Li \n(2000) from the University of Waterloo, for the performance and \noperation of a single PEM fuel cell. The model incorporates all the \nessential fundamental physical and electrochemical processes occurring \nin the membrane electrolyte, cathode catalyst layer, electrode backing \nand flow channel. The author attempted to improve the model of \nBernardi and Verbrugge (1991, 1992) by allowing the void space of the \ncatalyst layer to be occupied by gas reactants, liquid water and polymer \nelectrolyte. This allowed the model to simulate the concentration \noverpotential region of the polarization curve through the variation of a \nparameter called the degree of water flooding in the cathode catalyst \nlayer and/or cathode electrode backing region. It also included the effect \nof variable degree of water flooding on the cell performance. \n\nA single phase, isothermal, two-dimensional, transient model, \nusing a similar formulation as in Gurau et al. (1998), was presented in \nUm et al. (2000) from the Pennsylvania State University. Unlike the \nFLUENT model of the University of South Carolina group the recent \nmodels do not assume that the catalyst and polymer electrolyte layers \nare one-dimensional. This model paid special attention to the jump \noxygen condition at the gas diffuser/catalyst layer interface, which used \nHenry\u00b4s law to account for the difference of oxygen concentration \nbetween the liquid and the gas phase. They studied the influence of \nhydrogen dilution on the polarization curve and found that the cell \nvoltage decreases when reformate gas is used. A transient response of \n\n\n\n146 \n\ncurrent density with the change in output voltage is also presented. The \nmodel intended to extend the efficient single-domain CFD formulation \npreviously developed for batteries to PEM fuel cells. The author shows \na transient and multidimensional model that accounts simultaneously for \nelectrochemical kinetics, current distribution, hydrodynamics, and \nmulticomponent transport. One objective of this work was to develop a \ntransient, multidimensional model for electrochemical kinetics, current \ndistribution, fuel and oxidant flow, and multicomponent trans-port in a \nrealistic fuel cell by finite volume based computational fluid dynamics \n(CFD). The second goal, and one of practical importance, was to \nexplore hydrogen dilution effects in the anode feed on PEM fuel cells \nrunning on gas from fuel reforming. In Um and Wang C.Y. (2000), the \nauthors applied this multidimensional model to study electrochemical \nkinetics, current distribution, fuel and oxidant flow, and multicomponent \ntransport in a PEM fuel cell with the interdigitated air cathode. There, \nfully three dimensional computations were performed, and results of the \nflow field, species profiles and current density distribution were \npresented with emphasis on the air cathode. Polarization curves for \nconventional and interdigitated flow fields were simulated and \ncompared.  \n\nThe enhancement of the performance of the PEM fuel cells by \noptimizing the gas flow distribution system was studied by Honta\u00f1\u00f3n et \nal. (2000). In this study, 3D numerical simulations of the gas flow in the \nassembly, consisting of the fuel side of the bipolar plate and the anode, \nare performed using FLUENT. Two types of flow distributors are \ninvestigated: a grooved plate with parallel channels of the type \ncommonly used in commercial fuel cells, and a porous material. The \nsimulation showed that the permeability of the gas flow distributor is a \nkey parameter affecting the consumption of reactant gas in the \nelectrodes. Fuel utilization increased with decreasing permeability of the \nflow distributor. In particular, fuel consumption increased significantly \nwhen the permeability of the cathode porous material decreased to \nvalues below that of the anode. Even though the permeability of the \ngrooved plate can be diminished by reducing the width of the channels, \nvalues lower than 1mm are difficult to attain in practice. They showed \nthat porous materials are more advantageous than grooved plates in \nterms of reactant gas utilization. \n\nDutta et al. (2000), also from the University of South Carolina, \npresented a three dimensional numerical simulation of straight channel \nPEM fuel cells, at steady state, for an isothermal and single phase flow. \nThe model considered water transport in the flow channels as vapor, the \n\n\n\n147 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nelectrical resistance was neglected and the chemical reaction was \nassumed infinitely fast. The FLUENT software was used as a flow \nsolver. The domain included the anode flow channel and diffusion layer \non both sides and considered five chemical species, H2, O2, CO2, N2 and \nH2O. The model related the channel fluid-dynamic with the electrode \nand membrane processes and provided the axial distribution of the \ncurrent density and rate of water transport as a function of \nstoichiometric ratios of reactants and products, thickness of the MEA, \nflow conditions and cell voltage. Local current density was found to \ndecrease with an increase in the membrane thickness and when the cell \nvoltage is increased. The current density was found higher near the \nhydrogen inlet and the inlet orientation of the cathode side did not \nsignificantly influence the results for this operating condition because \nthe axial velocity on the anode side was relatively high. They concluded \nthat the effect of the GDL added to both sides of the MEA is to create a \nlarge reaction area. In the GDL the reactant are transported by both \nconvective and diffusive transport mechanisms and convection is not \nnegligible even for low porosity. The model was validated against \npublished experimental data. A transient simulation of the cell current \ndensity response to a step change in cell voltage was also analyzed. \nThey concluded that at high current densities (>1 A/cm2) a large amount \nof liquid water produced within the air cathode generates a two phase \nflow in this region, that becomes a limiting mechanism for cell \nperformance.  \n\nThis model was later completed by Dutta et al. (2001) modeling a \ncomplete fuel cell with a serpentine flow field. They presented the \nnumerical prediction of the velocity distribution, the gas-mixture \ndistribution, and the detailed reactant consumption on the MEA. The \nmodel was intended to predict the mass flow between channels with a \nserpentine flow path. Electro-chemical reactions were modeled as \nsource/sink terms in the solution of the complete three-dimensional \nNavier-Stokes equation with multicomponent mixture. It was \ndemonstrated that flow distribution in both anode and cathode channels \nare significantly affected by the mass consumption patterns on the \nMEA. The water transport was found governed by both electro-osmosis \nand diffusion processes.  \n\nThe research group from the Pennsylvania State University \npresented an improvement on their later work in Wang et al. (2001). \nThey studied analytically and numerically two-phase flow and transport \nof reactants and products in the air cathode of PEM fuel cells. Single- \nand two-phase regimes of water distribution and transport are classified \n\n\n\n148 \n\nby a threshold current density corresponding to the first appearance of \nliquid water at the membrane/cathode interface. When the cell operates \nabove the threshold current density, liquid water appears and a two-\nphase zone forms within the porous cathode. A two-phase, \nmulticomponent mixture model in conjunction with a finite-volume-\nbased computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique was applied to \nsimulate the cathode operation in this regime. The model was able to \nhandle the situation where a single-phase region co-exists with a two-\nphase zone in the air cathode. Capillary action was found to be the \ndominant mechanism for water transport inside the two-phase zone of \nthe hydrophilic structure. The liquid water saturation within the cathode \nwas predicted to reach 6.3% at 1.4 A/cm2 for dry inlet air. \n\nIn the study of Costamagna (2001), the transport equations are \nthe basis of a simulation model which allowed the evaluation of the \ndistribution of the physico-chemical parameters within the structure of a \nPEM fuel cell reactor. Model validation was presented and the validated \nmodel was then used to investigate the behavior of the fuel cell, with \nparticular attention to critical operating conditions. Critical conditions \nappeared in a number of cases: flooding, membrane drying and \ndegradation due to temperature peaks were discussed in this paper. \n\nRowe and Li (2001) developed a non-isothermal model of a PEM \nfuel cell that accounted for variable membrane hydration. The author \nincorporated the transport of mass, momentum, species, and energy in \nthe GDL, catalyst layer and membrane. It also included mass and \nspecies transport in the gas flow channels in a manner similar to \nBernardi and Verbrugge (1991, 1992). In the catalyst layers, the reaction \nkinetics was modeled with the Butler-Volmer equation. The diffusion \nwas assumed to be described by Stefan-Maxwell equations, as the only \ntransport media of species in the GDL and catalyst layer. Transport of \nliquid water was not analyzed, but the amount of flooding was included \nas an input parameter in order to simulate the entire polarization curve. \nThus the influence of mass transport limitations, temperature variation, \nand evaporation and condensation of water are regarded. Reactants in \nGDL and catalyst layer were allowed to have a variable amount of \nhumidification, which left the variable humidification membrane model \nof Springer et al. (1991, 1993) in the membrane. The model was used to \ninvestigate different fuel cell designs and operating conditions. The \neffect of the membrane hydration on the temperature of the cell was \nstudied.  \n\nNatarajan and Nguyen (2001) developed a transient, two-phase, \ntwo-dimensional model for the cathode electrode backing layer. For the \n\n\n\n149 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\ngas transport, the author used multicomponent diffusion equations and \nthey used an adapted form of Darcy's law to account for the capillary \nflow of liquid water in the porous GDL. Measurements were used to \nvalidate the model. The performance of the cathode was found to be \ndominated by the dynamics of liquid water, especially in the high \ncurrent density range. Conditions that promoted faster liquid water \nremoval such as temperature, dryness of the inlet gas stream, reduced \ndiffusion layer thickness, and higher porosity improved the performance \nof the cathode. The model results showed that for a fixed electrode \nwidth, a greater number of channels and shorter shoulder widths are \npreferred. The transient profiles clearly showed that liquid water \ntransport is the slowest mass-transfer phenomenon in the cathode and, is \nprimarily responsible for mass-transfer restrictions especially over the \nshoulder. This two-dimensional model was extended into a quasi-three-\ndimensional model by Natarajan and Nguyen (2003). As in the quasi-\ntwo-dimensional models, the flow in the gas flow channels was \nanalyzed by assuming that it was one-dimensional along the flow \ndirection. This analysis supplied boundary conditions to the two-\ndimensional analysis, coupling the flow in the gas flow channels and \nelectrode backing layers. The channel was discretized into control \nvolumes. An iterative solution procedure was incorporated into each \ncontrol volume to determine the average current density and the \ncorresponding oxygen consumption and water generation rates. \nDownstream channel concentrations were calculated based on \nstoichiometric flow rates and the solution obtained from the preceding \ncontrol volumes. Comparison of the model results with experimental \ndata and the existing 2D model showed that accounting for the oxygen \nconcentration variations along the channel and its effect on the current \ndensity is critical for accurately predicting the cathode performance. \nVariations in the current density along the channel were strongly \ninfluenced by the changes in oxygen concentration caused by \nconsumption due to reaction and dilution caused by water evaporation. \nOperating parameters that facilitated better water removal by \nevaporation like higher temperature and stoichiometric flow rates and \nlower inlet stream humidity resulted in a higher net current. Operating \nconditions that resulted in minimal loss in oxygen concentrations led to \na more uniform current density distribution along the channel. \n\nThe group from the University of Victoria developed a \ncomputational, three dimensional, non-isothermal model for PEM fuel \ncell in Berning et al. (2002). The model incorporates both MEA and \nchannel and can account for major of the transport phenomena inside the \n\n\n\n150 \n\nfuel cell. The model was implemented into a computational fluid \ndynamics code and has focus in physical insight and fundamental \nunderstanding. This objective was leaded by the author afforded by the \ndetail three dimensional distribution of reactant concentration, current \ndensities, temperature and water fluxes. The results evidenced the strong \ntemperature gradients presents inside the fuel cell even in the MEA. It \nwas also possible to significant impact fo t eh three dimensional nature \nof the transport on the current distribution and current density. \n\nLi et al. (2003) developed a 3D numerical model associating the \nheat and mass transfer and the electrochemical reaction in a PEM fuel \ncell and simulated a miniaturized PEM fuel cell with complex flow \nchannels. The numerical computation is based on the finite-volume \nmethod. Governing equations for flow and heat and mass transfer are \ncoupled with the electrochemical reactions and are solved \nsimultaneously. The perimeters of the bipolar plates are also included in \nthe computational domain to account for their heat conduction effect. \nThe miniaturized PEM fuel cell has an MEA sandwiched by two brass \nbipolar plates etched with a number of winding gas channels with a flow \narea of 250 \u00d7 250 microns. The influence of anode gas humidity on the \nperformance of the fuel cell is investigated through model prediction. \nFinally, field details of velocity, mass fraction and electromotive force \nare illustrated and discussed. \n\nA few works considered the porous media to have small pore size \nsuch that Knudsen diffusion dominates the transport of the chemical \nspecies. Kulikovsky (2003b) coupled a three-dimensional flow channel \nand electrode backing model with a one-dimensional model of the \ntransport in the catalyst layers and polymer electrolyte. The transport of \nwater in the electrolyte was modeled on the same approach as Springer \net al. (1991, 1993), while gas transport in the catalyst layer was assumed \nto be due to Knudsen diffusion only. In the catalyst layer, the \nconservation of water included the water flux due to a gradient in gas \nphase water concentration and a gradient in the hydration of the \nmembrane; thus, there were two unknowns but only one equation. \nHowever, the membrane hydration and the concentration of water in the \ngas phase were not independent, but rather related through the hydration \nversus relative humidity curves of Springer et al. (1991, 1993). Thus, the \ngradient of membrane hydration could be transformed to a gradient of \ngas phase water concentration and the conservation of total water was \nsolved. \n\nA different approach for steady state simulation in a two-\ndimensional geometry was presented by Siegel et al. (2003). The model \n\n\n\n151 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\naccounted for species transport, electrochemical kinetics, energy \ntransport, current distribution, and water uptake and release in the \ncatalyst layer. The authors solved the gas phase and liquid water \ntransport separately and coupled them with an interfacial mass transfer \nterm. The model for the catalyst region was based on an agglomerate \ngeometry, which required water species to exist in both dissolved and \ngaseous forms simultaneously. The author assumed that the void space \nof the catalyst layer was filled with both gas and polymer electrolyte. \nThe conservation of mass, momentum and species was applied to the \ngas phase, while the conservation of water was considered in the \nmembrane. The membrane model of Springer et al. (1991, 1993) was \nused to describe the water and current transport in the polymer \nelectrolyte. The commercial CFD solver CFDesign TM was used. Results \nshowed the relation between the fuel cell performance and the catalyst \nstructure. A similar model but including the transport of liquid water \nwithin the porous electrodes as well as the transport of gaseous species, \nprotons, energy and water dissolved in the ion condition polymer, was \npresented by Siegel et al. (2004). The author used measurements to \nvalidate the computational model. It is illustrated the importance of the \ntransport of water within the porous sections of the cell and in the \npolymer region of the MEA. \n\nThe detailed thermal and water management in the membrane of \nPEM fuel cells is investigated numerically by Yan et al. (2004). The \ncoupling effects of mass diffusion and temperature gradient on the water \ndistribution in the membrane were taken into account with consideration \nof the temperature dependent diffusivity. Thermal and water transport \nequations with various boundary conditions were solved by the control \nvolume method. Predictions showed that under the conditions of fixed \nwater concentration at the cathode side, the effect of cathode \ntemperature, Tc, on the water concentration is significant. Increasing Tc \nmay lead to an increase in membrane dehydration. At the water-flux \ncondition on the cathode side, the influence of the operating temperature \non the water distribution in the membrane showed a similar trend. The \neffects of the anode temperature, Ta, on  water management in the \nmembrane were also examined. It was found that Ta has a considerable \nimpact on the water content in the membrane. In addition, high current \ndensity may cause non-uniformity in the temperature distribution in the \nmembrane. \n\nUm and Wang (2004) presented a computational fuel cell \ndynamics (CFCD) model to elucidate 3D interactions between mass \ntransport and electrochemical kinetics in polymer electrolyte fuel cells \n\n\n\n152 \n\nwith straight and interdigitated flow fields, respectively. The model \nfeatures a detailed MEA sub model in which water transport through the \nmembrane with spatially variable transport properties and spatial \nvariations of the reaction rate and ionic resistance through the catalyst \nlayer are accounted for. Emphasis was placed on obtaining a basic \nunderstanding of how 3D flow and transport phenomena in the air \ncathode impact the electrochemical process in both types of flow field. \nFully 3D results of the flow structure, species profiles and current \ndistribution were presented for PEM fuel cells with an interdigitated \ncathode flow field. The model results indicated that forced convection \ninduced by the interdigitated flow field substantially improves mass \ntransport of oxygen to, and water removal from, the catalyst layer, thus \nleading to a higher mass-transport-limiting current density as compared \nto that of the straight flow field. \n\nNguyen et al. (2004) presented a three dimensional CFD model \nof a PEM fuel cell with serpentine flow field channels. The model \naccounted for the major transport phenomena in a PEM fuel cell: \nconvective and diffusive heat and mass transfer, electrode kinetics, and \npotential fields. A unique feature of the model is the implementation of \na voltage to-current (VTC) algorithm that solves for the potential fields \nand allows for the computation of the local activation overpotential. The \ncoupling of the local activation overpotential distribution and reactant \nconcentration makes it possible to predict the local current density \ndistribution more accurately. The simulation results reveal current \ndistribution patterns that are significantly different from those obtained \nin studies assuming a constant surface overpotential. Whereas the \npredicted distributions at high load show current density maxima under \nthe gas channel area, low load simulations exhibit local current maxima \nunder the collector plate land areas. A parallelized 3D CFD model is \npresented by Shimpalee et al. (2004) to a 480 cm2 PEM fuel cell flow \nfield selected from US patent literature to demonstrate that analysis of \nlarge-scale cells is possible. The distributions of pressure, temperature \nand electrochemical variables for stationary and automotive operating \nconditions were examined. Using parallel computing techniques, the \ncomputational time was shown to be significantly reduced by increasing \nthe number of processors while maintaining less than 1% error in mass \nbalance. \n\nTo master and organize the vast information in PEM fuel cell \nmodel in tabular form is one of the intension here. Table 8 presents \nsome of the last described articles in that way that allow the comparison \n\n\n\n153 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nbetween them.

(1991, \n1993) have been presented, with sample works being Wang and Wang \n(2006), Shimpalee (2006a, 2006b), Lister (2006), Arato and Costa \n(2006a 2006b), and Arato et al. 2006. More complete and \ncomprehensive works have been presented in the latest year by Baschuk \n(2006), Ren (2007) and Wishart (2008). \n\nThe literature review revealed the vast amount of information that \nexists in PEM fuel cell modeling and simulation (WEBER and \nNEWMAN, 2004; WANG C.Y., 2004; SOUSA and GONZALEZ, \n2005; SIEGEL, 2008; DJILALI 2007; WANG ET AL. 2011, JIAO and \nLI 2011).  \n\nMost of the recent works are improvements of the earlier models \nand implementations known as Computational Fuel Cell Dynamics \u2013\nCFCD. They explore multidimensional and multiphysics effects. The \nhigher computational capacity available today allows to use more \nrefined grids, explore more detailed geometries and to develop \noptimization routines aimed at optimizing certain design or operation \nfeatures. The basic phenomenology has remained unchanged, based on \nthe classical mass and charge transport models. Here, a review of these \nmodels is proposed in order to assess their limitations and propose more \ngeneral formulations which will allow exploring more detailed \nphenomena.  \n\nBefore advancing to the transport models, the measurement of a \npolarization curve and the application of the simpler lumped models is \npresented with the aim of providing a hands-on implementation of a fuel \ncell stack produced in Brazil and determining the magnitude of the \nmany macroscopic properties of a typical PEM fuel cell.  \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 MEASUREMENT OF THE POLARIZATION CURVE \n\nThis section presents the measurement and the zeroth \ndimensional modeling of the polarization curve of a 200 W PEM fuel \ncell operating in the Laboratory for Combustion and Thermal System \nEngineering (LabCET) at UFSC-Florianopolis. This test bench was first \nconceived by Silva (2010) and later improved by Nunes (2011) and \nMari\u00f1o (2011), simultaneously to this work.  \n\n3.1 MATERIALS AND APPARATUS \n\nThe test bench is composed of a 200 W PEM fuel cell \nmanufactured by Electrocell, Brazil, a supply and control gas station, a \ndynamic load, pressure and temperature measurement sensors.  \n\nThe gas station was designed for be used with three cylinders, \ntwo for reactants gases and one for the inert gas used for purge and \nhumidification. The reactant gases used were high purity oxygen and \nhydrogen and the inert gas was high purity nitrogen. All these gases are \nstored in a standard type T cylinder according to Table 9. \n\nTable 9 - Characteristics of the standard T type cylinder for gas storage \n\nGas \nCharging Pressure at \n21\u00b0C \n\nVolume \nSTP \n(m3) \n\nPurity type \n(Analitico) \n\nFunction \n\nH2 \n16.475,18 (kPa) \n(168kgf/cm2) \n\n7,2 99,999 % Reactant \n\nO2 \n19.613,3 (kPa) \n(200kgf/cm2) \n\n10 99,99 % Reactant \n\nN2 \n19.613,3 (kPa) \n(200kgf/cm2) \n\n9 99,999 % \nPurge and \nhumidificatio\nn \n\n \nFigure 34 presents a schematic representation of the gas station \n\nformed by three cylinders, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen, and pipe \nlines made of \u00bc inch steel pipe with metallic junction \n\n\n\n158 \n\nFigure 34 - Gas distribution and control network \n\n \nThe 200W fuel cell bench is composed by two sub-systems, a) \n\nthe gas control measurement and humidification system; and b) the fuel \ncell stack electrical performance system. \n\nFigure 35 presents the humidification system. This system is a \nbubbling system that guarantees water saturation of the gas at the chosen \ntemperature. Temperature at humidifier is established with an electrical \nresistance controlled by a relay. Mass controllers in the range of 5 l/min \nare used for both reactants. The controllers have a measurement \nuncertainty of \u00b1 0.005 l/min. \n\nFigure 36 is a representation of the Fuel cell stack load and \ntemperature control. The power delivered by the PEMFC stack is \ncontrolled by a dynamic load. The dynamic load has an estimated \nuncertainly of \u00b1 0.01% of the reading. Thermal control is performed by \nforced convection of an air flow in rectangular channels placed among \nthe bipolar plates, using a variable power DC fan \n\n\n\n159 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nFigure 35 - Gas control measure and humidification system \n\n \n \nFigure 36 - Fuel cell stack electrical performance system \n\n \nThe gas control, measurement and humidification sub-system, is \n\ncomposed by: i) two mass flow controllers controlled by a PC with \nLabView\u00ae routine, one for oxygen and the other for hydrogen, and ii) \nthe humidification system. Figure 37 shows a picture of the bench inside \nthe test room. \n\n\n\n160 \n\nFigure 37 - 200W PEM Fuel cell stack bench at LabCET \n\n \nThe humidification system are two steel cylinders of 490 cm3 of \n\ninternal volume (25 cm height and 10.16 cm internal diameter), \nthermally insulated from the environment and with a deionized water \ncolumn, Figure 38. The humidifiers are designed to obtain full \nsaturation at the set-point temperature for both gases. Besides \nhumidification, this system is also responsible for the gas heating at the \ncell temperature in order to avoid condensation inside it.  \n\nThe thermal control in the humidifier water is done by electrical \nresistance, thermocouples (K-type) and a relay device to regulate the \npower input to the resistance to follow the set-point temperature. A \nporous stone at the bottom of the inlet line is responsible for spreading \nthe gas in mini-bubbles to increase the total contact area with the heated \nwater and guarantee the total humidification during the rising of the \nbubbles along the deionized water column with height of 10 cm. The gas \npipes from the humidifier to the fuel cell inlet are thermally insulated. \n\n\n\n161 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nFigure 38 - Gas humidifier and thermal control \n\n \nThe fuel cell stack\u2019s electrical performance system allows the \n\ncontrol of the power taken from the fuel cell (or delivered to it). This \ncontrol is done by a dynamic load, device capable of setting a defined \nvariable (current) in order to demand another variable (tension). The \ndynamic load used in the 200 W bench has a current limit equal to 25 A \nand it is operated by computer. When the fuel cell is operating, heat is \nproduced from the cathode reaction. This would increase the \ntemperature if it was not removed from the stack. For this reason a \ncooling system is necessary. The cooling system of the stack is based on \nconvective cooling by air blown by a 7 W DC air fan, fed by a 48 V \nvariable power load source. Currently, the control of the power load is \nmanual but a new automatic system is being implemented as proposed \nby Mari\u00f1o (2011). As a visual verification of the gas flux, two bubblers \nare located at the gas outlet of the fuel cell stack. After the bubblers, the \nremaining reactant gas is exhausted into the atmosphere. A more detail \ndescription of the 200 W bench can be found in Nunes (2011). \n\n3.2 METHODOLOGY \n\nThe methodology used to characterize the 200W fuel cell stack is \nthe measurement of voltage as a response to a set current. The \npolarization curve is a direct measure of the fuel cell performance and \nefficiency.  \n\nThe uncertainties related to the measurements are expressed as  \n\nmaxRM I E= \u00b1       (3.1) \nwhere RM is the result of the measurement, I is the average of the \nindications of \u201cn\u201d repeated measurements, and Emax is the maximum \n\n\n\n162 \n\nerror of the measurement process for the measured conditions \n(ALBERTAZZI and SOUSA, 2008). \n\nThe values for Eq. (3.1) corresponding to the two lines of \nmeasurement, the dynamic load and the flow controller are shown in \nTable 10.  \n\nTable 10 - Measurement uncertainties of the measurement systems. \nDynamic load from Electrocell  CDE25A-20V \nAccuracy \u00b11% full scale Maximum \n\nerror \n\u00b10.25A \n\n \nUser\u2019s guide OMEGA mass flow controllers FMA 5400/ FMA 5500 \nAccuracy \u00b11.5% if full scale, including \n\nlinearity for gas temperatures \nfrom 15\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C and \npressure of 0.35 to 4.1 bar \n\nMaximum \nerror \n\n\u00b10.15 l/min \n\nRepeatability  \u00b10.5% of full scale Random \nerror  \n\n\u00b10.05 l/min  \n\n \n \nThe standard test procedure consisted in operations for purging, \n\nheating, activation and testing: \n\u2022 Purging: A nitrogen flow of 1 l/min was established for 40 \n\nminutes at 50\u00b0C to purge and humidify.  \n\u2022 Activation: An oxygen  flow of 1.5 l/min and a nitrogen flow of 3 \n\nl/min were established in the open circuit cell (idling) for 10 \nminutes at 50\u00b0C in order to active the cell.  \n\n\u2022 Heating: A current of 15 A was imposed in the circuit in order to \nheat the fuel cell up to 5oC above that of the test temperature.  \n\n\u2022 Testing: The initial oxygen and hydrogen flux were held constant \nduring the tests. Pressure was equal to 50 kPa manometric on \nboth sides of the membranes. The polarization curve was \nobtained by setting a current and waiting for 2 minutes, which \nwas determined sufficient for the stabilization of the cell before \nreading the voltage (NUNES, 2011). \n\n\u2022 Different conditions were tested and a set of three tests were \nperformed in order to check the repeatability of the results. \n\n3.3 RESULTS \n\nAn early test evidenced that the maximum current of the dynamic \nload (25 A) was under dimensioned for the fuel cell stack used. Using \nthe effective area provided by the manufacturer (144 cm3), it was found \n\n\n\n163 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nthat at this maximum current the fuel cell stack remained in the ohmic-\nloss regime and the mass transfer-limited regime could not be reached. \nThis limited the amount of information that could be obtained directly \nfrom the tests. The modeling will allow for obtaining additional \ninformation but at the cost of further validation against other \npolarization curves available from the literature.  \n\nBatteries of tests were run to determine the response of the stack \nwhen operating in different humidification and cell temperatures, set \nboth at the same values. Three temperatures were selected: 50\u00b0C, 60\u00b0C, \n70\u00b0C, and 80\u00b0C. Smaller current steps were used at low currents in order \nto better describe the performance during the rapid voltage drop in the \nactivation regime. Figure 39 shows the averaged (a) polarization curve \nand (b) electrical power observed for each temperature. The electric \npower curve was calculated after smoothing out the measurements using \nthe model that will be described shortly. \n\nAlthough the averaged polarization curves are superposed, the \nfuel cell stack presented a slightly better performance at 70\u00b0C, with \nmaximum power of about 183 W, more uniformity between runs and \nless oscillation. At low currents, there was no noticeable difference \namong the different runs. The run at 50\u00b0C presented higher oscillation at \nhigher currents. The tests performed later presented better stability, \nprobably due to better activation as the extent of utilization of the fuel \ncell increased. Given the higher stability, the test at 70\u00b0C was taken as \nthe base polarization curve, characteristic of the performance of this \nunit. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n164 \n\nFigure 39 -Average curves of (a) polarization and (b) electrical power for the \nfour temperatures in the first group of tests \n\n \n\n \n \n \nFigure 40 presents the averaged polarization curve for this \n\ntemperature.  \n\n\n\n165 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L.

The model is largely based \non Spiegel (2008) and Larminie and Dicks (2003), with improvements \nin the calculation of the (mass-transfer limited) limiting current. The \nmain hypotheses assumed are: \n\u2022 Hydrogen, oxygen and water vapor are ideal gases. \n\u2022 Water can only enter in gas phase mixed with the reactants. \n\u2022 The relative humidity of reactant gases changes as the temperature \n\nchange from the gas inlet to the cell temperature. Both evaporation \nand condensation are allowed.  \n\n\u2022 Reactant is assumed to be 100% humidified at the gas inlet \ntemperature. \n\n\u2022 The same pressure is assumed for the cell and humidifiers.  \nThe modeling was developed based on the principles and \n\nequations described in Chapter 2. The solution of the model follows the \nsame steps as the experiments. The current is increased at given steps \nand the corresponding fuel cell stack voltage is calculated. \n\nThe fuel cell electrical potential is given by: \na o c\n\nc\nE E ? ? ?= ? ? ?

Figure 41 shows the control volume used for developing the \nmodels. The arrows indicate the convective flow in the channel and the \nGDL surface mass transfer. The models for the mass transfer across the \nGDL are basically film models.

This assumption is considered \nacceptable for high current densities, since, at high currents, the largest \nresistance to mass transfer occurs within the GDL, which favors to \napproximate the surface oxygen concentration to the bulk channel \nconcentration. Assuming that the channel cross-sectional area, the \npressure and the convective mass transfer coefficient are constant along \nthe channel, and that diffusion along the channel is negligible when \ncompared to convection, the conservation of mass of oxygen in the \nchannel, under steady-state, becomes \n\n( ) ( )mm s m s\nm flow\n\nhd\nc c c c\n\ndx v w\n\n?\n? = ?

Looking at the expression for the convective mass transfer \nresistance Rconv in eqs. (4.16) it is possible to note that fuel cells with \nlarge areas difficult the mass transfer, and thus smaller fuel cells are \nmore efficient than larger ones. The denominator of eq. (4.16) increases \nas the volumetric flow rate increases. When the flow rate tends to \ninfinite, Rconv tends to 1/( m cellh A? ). This is not surprising since it reflects \na constant concentration in the flow channel. It can also be seen that \nincreasing the area covered by the flow field channels, i.e., increasing ?, \ncan improve the performance. This is probably more cost effective than \nto obtain a small increase in the convective mass transfer coefficient by \nincreasing the flow velocity.  \n\nAlthough the derivation was based on the cathode, it\u2019s important \nto recall that there are two different limiting currents, one for the anode, \nrelated to the hydrogen mass transport, and the other for the cathode, \nrelated to the oxygen mass transport. In the model, both limiting \ncurrents are calculated and the lowest current is adopted as the fuel cell \nlimiting current.  \n\n\n\n172 \n\n \nVariable surface concentration mass-transport model: \n \nThe second mass transfer model is based in a similar approach, \n\nbut the supposition of uniform concentration in the GDL surface is \nremoved.

Therefore, the basic set of parameters obtained can be used \nfor any temperature of operation.  \n\n4.1 MODEL VALIDATION \n\nThe validation of the model relied in literature measurements, to \nvalidate the activation and ohmic loss regimes and the limiting current \nmass transfer model. In the activation and ohmic loss regime, the \nparameters that characterize the fuel cell behavior and that are identified \n\nfrom the measurements are 1 ,k ? , electR and iloss. \nIn the mass transfer limited region, the parameters that \n\ncharacterize the fuel cell behavior, for a given set of pressure, \ntemperature and flow rates, are Deff/? and hm/?. From these, the limiting \ncurrent iL can be obtained.  \n\n\n\n174 \n\nAn empirical model available in the literature (KIM et al., 1995) \nwas used for the validation of the model developed here, including the \nmass transfer limited regime. The authors obtained measurements for a \n50 cm2 fuel cell at temperatures of 50\u00b0C and 70\u00b0C and pressures of 100 \nkPa, 300 kPa and 500 kPa. Then, an overall model, written as, \n\no  = log( ) exp( )E E b i Ri m ni? ? ?    (4.28) \nwas curve fitted to their measurements. The constants appearing in Eq. \n(4.12) are reported in Kim et. al. (1995).  \n\nThe model presented in Kim et. al. (1995) is basically equivalent \nto the one used here in regards to activation and ohmic losses. The \nmethodology used for the estimation of parameters separates the \nactivation and ohmic regimes from the mass transfer limited regime. \nThe activation and ohmic losses are first determined, by direct \ncomparison to the author\u2019s empirical equation, and then the remaining \nconcentration losses parameters are determined by linear regression of \nthe model developed to the author\u2019s measurements. \n\nIn the activation and ohmic losses regimes, the parameter ?  is \nobtained from,  \n\nln(10)?\n=\n\nRT\nb\n\nnF\n   (4.29) \n\nwhere b and R are the values reported by Kim et al. (1995).  \nThe equilibrium exchange current density is obtained from \n\n2\n\n10\n? +\n\n=\no NernstE E C\n\nb\no\ni    (4.30) \n\nwhere Eo is taken from the article and ENernst is obtained from eq. (4.2) \ntaking into account the pressure and temperature of the inlet gases, \nassuming a relative humidity of 100 %. A loss current iloss of 0.001 \nA/cm2 is used in order to couple the model in the zero current density \npotential.  \n\nFor the mass transport controlled regime, the concentration losses \nin the anode are neglected as being small in comparison to those in the \ncathode. As the paper lacks information about the dimensions of the \nGDL and flow field channels, the curve fit of the model to the \nmeasurements allow for the determination of the combined parameters \nDeff/? and hm/?. In the results shown, these combined parameters are \ndenotes as: \n\n; ;\neff\n\nm m\n\nD H\nD H h Bi\n\nD\n?\n\n?\n= = =     (4.31) \n\n\n\n175 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E.

For this, the function lqscurvefit already available \nin MATLAB was used. The model was assumed acceptable when the \ndeviations from the measurements were minimized and then, the curve \nfitted set of parameters is taken as the characteristic parameters of the \nfuel cell.  \n\n4.1.1 Results of the validation \n\nThe presentation of the validation results will begin by analyzing \nthe concentration loss overpotential and then the complete polarization \ncurve.  \n\nFigure 42 shows the result of the fitting procedure of the \nconcentration overpotential at 50 oC and 70 oC and at different feed \npressures (P 1 =100 kPa, P 2 = 300 kPa and P 3=500 kPa). In Figure 42a \nboth temperatures (50 oC and 70 oC) for the model using constant \nconcentration shows that the largest deviations are present at the \npressure of 100 kPa mainly at low temperatures. The model predicts a \nfaster fall down due to mass transfer limitation, above 1.2 A/cm2, while \n\n\n\n176 \n\nthe measurements suggest a less steep variation. A better prediction of \nthis region for both temperatures is obtained using the second mass \ntransfer model (variable concentration), as presented in Figure 42 (b). In \ngeneral, the curve fitting may be considered acceptable.  \n\nThe full set of parameters obtained from the curve fits are now \nused to calculate the full polarization curves and compared to the \nempirical function obtained from the measurements by Kim et al. \n(1995). Figure 43 present the comparison between the reference and the \nmodels at 50oC using a) constant cs, and (b) variable cs. The same \nsituation at 70oC is presented in Figure 44(a) and (b). The model curve \nfits very closely the results of the empirical equation. The curve fitting is \nbetter at the higher temperature, probably because the hypothesis used \nbetter approximate the operation of the fuel cell during the experiments.  \n\nTable 11 and Table 12 present a summary of the fitted parameters \nfor the experiments at 50 \u00b0C and 70 \u00b0C at the three pressures tested. The \nmass transport parameters in Table 11were obtained from the curve \nfitting using the first mass transfer model, while for the parameters in \nTable 4, the second mass transfer model was used. Both the correlation \ncoefficient and the sum of the squares of the deviations do not present a \nnoticeable improvement for the second mass transfer model, since in \nmost of the polarization curve, both mass transport models result in a \ngood agreement.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n177 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L.

Nonetheless, from the data in Table 12, a \nfew observations can be made. \n\nRegarding the values of H, at the expected low Reynolds number \ntypical of the flow in these channels, the flow regime is laminar, leading \nto a constant Sherwood number (Sh = hm dh /D), say 3.67. The value for \nthe binary diffusion coefficient for oxygen and water vapor at 70oC, 1 \natm, from the Chapmann-Enskog model, is approximately 3.3 \u00d7 10-5 \nm2/s. Assuming that the channel height and width is 1 mm, that only 1 \nside is in contact to the GDL, and that ?=0.5, we obtain H = 6 \u00d7 10-2 m/s, \none order of magnitude higher than the values listed in Table 12. \n\nRegarding the effect of pressure in the parameter H, at a constant \ntemperature and electrical current, the molar consumption of gases \nremains the same. At higher pressures, the mixture molar concentration \nincreases. Therefore, the flow velocity decreases proportionally to the \nincrease in pressure. However, since the molar rate is constant and the \ndynamic viscosity at low pressure (p &lt;10 atm) is independent of \npressure (\u00b5 ? constant), the Reynolds number is independent of \npressure. Likely, the flow will remain laminar. The mass diffusivity at \nlow pressure is inversely proportional to pressure (pD ? constant). \nTherefore, the convective mass transfer coefficient decreases \nproportionally to the increase in pressure, causing a decrease in the \nvalue of H. The decrease observed of H observed in  Table 12 at 70oC \nfollows this trend closely: At 3 atm, it drops to 30% of the value at 1 \natm and at 5 atm, it drops to 20% of the value at 1 atm. At 50oC, \nhowever, the value of H decreases 36 times from 1 atm to 3 atm and \nthen decreases as expected from 3 atm to 5 atm. This may be justified if \nwe can argue that the effect of pressure at low temperature is higher in \nthe activation of the catalytic reactions than it is in the mass transfer \ncoefficient. The test of that hypothesis requires a more refined \nmodeling. \n\nThe effect of temperature on H can be understood in the same \nway. From the Chapman-Enskog model for gases at low pressure, the \ntemperature dependency of the binary mass diffusivity for the pair \nwater-air follows T2.01. Therefore, changing the temperature from 50oC \nto 70oC causes a 13% increase in H. The increase in H at 3 and 5 atm is \n\n\n\n183 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\n37% and 200% respectively. At 1 atm, H experiences a decrease. The \nbehavior in H cannot be described entirely by the change experienced in \nthe mass diffusivity, expressing that there are important changes in the \nflow field within the GDL and effectiveness of the catalyst layer which \nare not appropriately accounted for with the model at hand.  \n\nThe parameter D is the ratio of the effective diffusivity and the \nGDL thickness. Porosity and tortuosity for the dry GDL are estimated in \n?=0.50 and ?=1.25, from models for the effective diffusivity \n(KAVIANY, 1995). This provides a dry effective diffusivity of 1.2 \u00d7 10-\n5 m2/s. The GDL thickness is taken as ? = 100 \u00b5m = 1 \u00d7 10-4 m. This \nwould give DAB = 1,2 \u00d7 10\n\n-1 m/s. Considering, however, that near the \nlimiting current the GDL would be flooded and could hold as much as \n99% liquid water (per pore volume), this value would be reduce to D = \n1,2 \u00d7 10-3 m/s, compatible to the values reported in Table 12. Therefore, \nthis order of magnitude analysis shows that the correct modeling of the \ntransport in the GDL, considering the presence of liquid water, is \nimportant for the prediction of the mass transport limit of the fuel cell.  \n\nThe electrochemical parameters can also be qualitatively \nchecked. The values for ?  are in the range (0.3-0.7) commonly found \nin the literature (SPIEGEL, 2008). The values for io listed in Table 12 \nare within the expected range according to the literature (SPIEGEL, \n2008; BARBIR, 2011; LARMINIE and DICKS, 2003). Also, Eq. (4.4), \nprovides a model for the exchange current as a function of temperature \nand pressure (repeated here to facilitate the discussion) \n\n2\n1 exp 1o\n\nref ref\n\nkp T\ni k\n\np T T\n\n?\n? ?? ? ? ?\n\n= ? ?? ?? ? ? ?? ? ? ?? ?\n? ? ? ?? ?\n\n   (4.35) \n\nUsing the values calculated and reported in Table 11 and Table \n12, the parameters k1, k2 and ? in Eq. (4.4) can be curve-fitted. Table 13 \ncompares the values of the exchange current obtained from this curve-fit \nof Eq. (4.4) to those listed in Table 11 and Table 12, for both mass \ntransfer models. The adherence of the model given by Eq. (4.4) is \nadequate. The values obtained for k1, k2 and ? are listed in Table 14. The \nvalue of k1 is found to be in the expected range from the literature \n(SPIEGEL, 2008) and the mass transfer model has a strong effect on the \ncurve-fitted value for k1. k2 is found to be negative in both cases. This is \nmuch unexpected, as we show in the next section, and we provide no \nexplanation for this result. Regarding ?  it can be seen that the reaction \nkinetics depends on pressure with an exponent smaller than one, which \n\n\n\n184 \n\nis an expected behavior due to progressive saturation of the catalyst \nlayers (CANDUSSO et al, 2006). \n\n\n\n185 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L.

With MM stands for \nmembrane model and without MM stands for assuming constant \nmembrane water saturation. \n\nWe note that the same values of k1, k2 and ? are used for \npredicting the polarization curves in all temperatures. Table 15 \npresents the results considering the full model for the membrane \n(following Springer et al., (1991)) and also assuming constant \nmembrane saturation. The value of the ohmic resistance responds \nstrongly to the membrane model, while the other parameters are \nnot as sensitive.  \n\nFigure 45 presents the curves obtained from the models \ncompared to the measurements. It can be seen that the model fits \nthe data accurately for all the temperatures. Only at 50oC the \nmodel apparently over predicts the measured potential at lower \ncurrents. Also, the model including the membrane model presents \nthe best behavior overall.  \n\n\n\n187 \n \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E.

We also \nobserve that the values of k1 reported in Table 15 have the same \norder of magnitude of the ones reported on Table 14, although \nsmaller. k2, on the other hand, present positive values, leading to \nthe usual behavior with temperature, as reported by Spiegel \n(2008). The value of ? was not obtained since all measurements \nwere performed at atmospheric pressure.  \n\n4.3 CONCLUSION \n\nThe global model used allowed the characterization of the \nfuel cell stack at four different temperatures predicting the \npolarization curve with good accuracy. The model can be used to \nobtain global parameters that can compare the performance of \ndifferent systems, or, of the same system at different operation \nconditions, using a single set of parameters, as the ones reported \nin Table 15. The use of the membrane model by Springer et al. \n(1991) and the variable GDL surface concentration model (model \n2) gave better overall fitting, both for the literature as well as for \nthe measured polarization curves. The analysis employed known \nmass transfer models showed that the mass transport phenomena \n\n\n\n188 \n\nthat occurs within the GDL requires a more detailed modeling in \norder to be fully understood. \n\nThis detailed modeling must rely on the basic conservation \nequations for the species mass transport within the two-phase \nflow (water-gas) in the porous medium that forms de GDL. The \nanalysis of these detailed models is done in the next chapters and \na more complete model for mass transport in MEA is proposed.   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\nPart II \n \n\nMulticomponent, multiphase modeling of heat \nand mass transfer in porous layers of PEM \n\nfuel cells \n \nThe objectives of this second part to review the available \ncontinuum mechanics and thermodynamic models for heat and \nmass transfer in continuum media,  \nThe emphasis is devoted to the development of the constitutive \nrelations for mass transfer in the context of the Maxwell-Stefan \nformulation for a general concentration, pressure, temperature \nand body force (e.g., electrical) driving potential.

An equivalent equation for the \nmass diffusion fluxes can also be obtained using the conservation of the \nspecies linear momentum (WILLIAMS, 1958; WHITAKER, 1994, \n2009; CURTISS AND BIRD, 1996; LAM, 2006). However, the \nprocedures lead to different forms of the Maxwell-Stefan equations, that \nhave been rendered equivalent using order of magnitude arguments \n(WHITAKER, 2009), which hold exact only for static mechanical \nequilibrium. During flow in porous media, the microscopic viscous \neffects play a very important role and it is still not clear how these \neffects should be taken into account in the general transport equations \nfor mass diffusion in porous media. This has generated different models \nsuch as the Dusty Gas Model (MASON et al, 1983), the Binary Friction \nModel (KERKHOF, 1996) and several variations. In order to elucidate \nthe hypothesis behind and the significance of each of the terms in the \ndifferent models, a thorough review of the derivation of the basic \nequations is provided.  \n\nThe main purpose of this chapter is, based on the literature, to \narrive at the proper form of the entropy conservation equation for a \nmulticomponent mixture. The equation for the conservation of energy is \nobtained as a step needed to derive the equation for the conservation of \nentropy. The main interest rests on isothermal mass transport. The \nMaxwell-Stefan formulation of the diffusion fluxes is then obtained \nbased both on the inversion of the species linear momentum equation \nand on Irreversible Thermodynamics reasoning from the entropy \ndissipation function. The main differences between the approaches of \nLightfoot (1974), Curtiss and Bird (1996), Lam (2006) and Whitaker \n(2009) are presented with the aim at arriving at a general formulation for \nthe Maxwell-Stefan equation for mass diffusion.  \n\nThis chapter is basically a comprehensive review of the literature. \nNext chapter will present a critical analysis of the different formulations. \n\n\n\n192 \n\n5.1 BASIC DEFINITIONS \n\nIn order to clearly define the meaning of the variables and to \nfacilitate the presentation of the transport equations for multicomponent \nsystems some definitions relevant for the next sections are given. \n\nThe mass concentration of component i is defined as the ratio of \nthe mass of component i (mi) and the total volume of the mixture V, i.e., \n\nm\ni\n\ni\nV\n\n? =  (5.1) \n\n \nThe density of the mixture is given as the ratio between the total \n\nmass m and the total volume V, i.e., \nm\n\nV\n? =       (5.2) \n\nSince \n1\n\nNe\n\nii\nm m\n\n=\n= ?  \n\n1\n\ncN\n\ni\n\ni\n\n? ?\n=\n\n= ?

These equations \nare given by Bird at al. (2002), Haase (1969), De Groot and Mazur \n(1984), Slattery (1981), Rosner (1986), Kuiken (1994) and Kaviany \n(2001b), among others.  \n\nThe development assumes that the continuum fluid phase is \nformed by Nc chemical species, each one of them forming its own \ncontinuum capable of motion and interaction with the remaining \nspecies. The fluid is then a superposition of Nc continua. At each point r \nin time t, a mixture particle may be found that contains molecules of all \nthe chemical species. Therefore, in this point, all material particles of all \nspecies share the same total volume and may be followed independently \nas they flow with their own velocity vector ui. \n\nIn order to state the conservation of mass of species i in a \nmulticomponent fluid, we define a material volume Vi of species i that \ncontains species i and whose material surface Si follows species i as it \nflows and reacts. At time t = 0, the material volume for the mixture V \nalso contains a fraction of the other species j. After an elapsed time t, in \ngeneral, we admit that Vi has suffered deformation, there has been \nseparation and chemical reaction among i and j. \n\n5.3.1 Conservation of mass  \n\nFor any chemical species i the conservation of mass can be \nwritten as  \n\n,\n\n( ) ( )i i\n\ni r i\n\nV t V t\n\nd\ndV w dV\n\ndt\n? =? ? ?

We admit that both the mass concentration and the \nreaction rate of species i are continuous functions of the thermodynamic, \ntime and space variables. The mass rate of reaction for all the i = 1, 2, \n\u2026, Nc species must satisfy \n\n,\n1\n\n0\ncN\n\nr i\n\ni\n\nw\n=\n\n=? ?

(5.57) \n\nDifferent reference velocities may be defined leading to different \nforms of the equation for the conservation of mass of species i \ndepending on the choice of reference velocity and measure of the \nspecies i concentration.

The conservation of the linear \nmomentum for species i for the material volume Vi, neglecting the \nelectromagnetic momentum, is postulated as (Newton\u2019s second law) \n\n( )\n1( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\n\n, ,\n\n( )\n\nu t P\n\nu\n\nc\n\ni i i i\n\ni\n\nN\n\ni\ni i i i i n ij\n\njV t V t A t V t\n\nr i r i\n\nV t\n\nd\ndV dV dA dV\n\ndt\n\nw dV\n\n? ?\n=\n\n= + + +?? ? ? ?\n\n?\n\nf\n\n?\n     (5.61) \n\nwhere \ni\n\nd dt  is the material derivative in respect to species i, fi is an \n\nexternal body force applied on species i, ti(n) is a vector expressing the \nflux of momentum entering the material surface Ai by other mechanisms \n(actually, it is not the partial stress vector for species i, as it will be \nshown below), Pij is the drag force exerted by species j over species i \n\n(by elastic collisions) and , ,ur i r iw? accounts for the \n\nproduction/destruction of linear momentum due to chemical reaction \n\n\n\n202 \n\n(from inelastic collisions). Whitaker (2009) remarks that ,u ur i i? . The \nexchange of momentum between species by elastic and inelastic \ncollisions is the result of mutual interactions. Therefore, it is required \nthat \n\n1 1\n\nP 0\nc cN N\n\nij\n\ni j= =\n\n=? ?     (5.62) \n\nwhich is satisfied by Pij = Pji , and \n\n, ,\n1\n\nu 0\ncN\n\nr i r i\n\ni\n\nw\n=\n\n=? ?     (5.63) \nThe momentum diffusion vector is the projection of the \n\nmomentum diffusion tensor Ti over area Ai, i.e., \n\ni( ) it n Tn = ?     (5.64) \n\nwhere n is the normal unit vector pointing out of area Ai. \nAssuming symmetry of the momentum diffusion tensor and using \n\nthe divergence theorem, \n\n( )\n\n( ) ( )\n\ni( )\n( ) ( )\n\n( ) ( )\n\nt n T\n\nT n T\n\ni i\n\ni i\n\nn i\nA t A t\n\ni i\nA t V t\n\ndA dA\n\ndA dV\n\n? ?\n\n= ? = ? ?\n\n? ?\n\n? ?\n (5.65) \n\nAs before, using the Reynolds Transport Theorem and invoking \nthe invariance over the integration volume Vi, the conservation of \nmomentum for species i becomes \n\n( ) ( ) , ,\n1\n\nu T f P u\nNc\n\ni i i i i i i i ij r i r i\n\nj\n\nu u w\nt\n\n? ? ?\n=\n\n?\n+ ? ? = ? ? + + +\n\n?\n? ?  (5.66) \n\nThis is equivalent to Whitaker (2009) in his Eq.(23). In order to \nmake the symbology compatible with Curtiss and Bird (1996) in their \nAppendix A, and with the Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes to \nbe developed below, a minus sign will be added to the divergence of the \nmomentum flux tensor, obtaining \n\n( ) ( ) , ,\n1\n\nu T f P u\nNc\n\ni i i i i i i i ij r i r i\n\nj\n\nu u w\nt\n\n? ? ?\n=\n\n?\n+ ? ? = ?? ? + + +\n\n?\n? ?  (5.67) \n\nTherefore, Ti from Curtiss and Bird (1996), and in the form that \nwill be used here, is equivalent to -TA  as used by Whitaker (2009).  \n\nA different form of expressing the species momentum equation is \nby using the species material derivate \n\n\n\n203 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L.

(5.69) \nWhitaker (2009) arrives at the same equation but he maintains a \n\nlast term ( ), , iu ur i r iw ??  by remarking that the species velocity for the \nreaction term \n\n,u r i  may not be equal to the velocity for the species ui. \n\nFrom asymptotic analysis, Lam (2006) suggests that the contribution of \ninelastic collisions to the equation above is negligible (see also, De \nGroot and Mazur, 1984). We note that only the elastic momentum \nexchange is retained here. Lam (2006) denotes the elastic collisions term \nas  \n\n1\n\nP\nNc\n\ncoll\n\nij i\n\nj\n\nG\n=\n\n=?      (5.70) \nIn analogy to the stress tensor for a Newtonian fluid, the \n\nmomentum diffusion tensor is separated in a pressure and a viscous \ncomponent \n\ni i iT I+p ?=       (5.71) \nwhere pi is the partial pressure of species i, I is the identity matrix and \n\ni?  is a tensor related to viscous phenomena, whose identity is still \nunknown.

(5.72) \nCurtiss and Bird (1996) do not make this separation into pressure \n\nand viscous effects, but this will prove itself useful below. Summing up \nover all the chemical species i, we should obtain the equation for the \nconservation of the momentum of the mixture. To accomplish that, the \nidentity \n\n( ) ( ) ( )u u = u u uu uu u u u ui i i i i i i i i? ? ?+ ? + ? ?   (5.73) \nis substituted in the left-hand side of Eq. (5.67) and the resulting \nequation is summed over i obtaining \n\n\n\n204 \n\n( ) ( )u uu f Sp\nt\n\n? ? ?\n?\n\n+ ? ? = ?? + ? ? ?\n?\n\n (5.74) \n\nwhere \n\n1\n\nNc\n\ni\n\ni\n\np p\n=\n\n= ?

(5.77) \nSince the last term can be equated to the stress tensor for a \n\nmixture that behaves as a Newtonian fluid, Cauchy\u2019s equation of motion \nfor a Newtonian fluid is recovered. This assumption also implies that the \nstress tensor for the mixture can be written as \n\nI ST p= +  (5.78) \n     \n\nIf a partial stress tensor Si can be defined such that \n\n1\n\nS S\nNc\n\ni\n\ni=\n\n= ?      (5.79) \nthen, we can identify \n\nS\ni i i i i\n\nV V? ?= +      (5.80) \nThis still does not evidence what the terms \n\ni\n?  are. In this form, \n\ni\n?  can be only identified as the difference between Si and i i iV V? . Eq. \n(5.74) is equivalent as that presented by Whitaker (2009), except for the \nsign of Si as remarked above. Eq.

This form of the entropy generation \nsatisfies three basic requirements: \n\n1. It vanishes when the system reaches equilibrium,  \n2. it is invariant under a Galileian transformation and,  \n3. Upon integration over a closed system, it retries \n\nClausius statement for the second law (DE GROOT and \nMAZUR, 1996).  \n\nThe generation of entropy has a central role in the \nThermodynamics of Irreversible Process (TPI) in defining the forces \nthat drive the system to equilibrium from a non-equilibrium condition. \n\n5.3.5 Constitutive relation for mass diffusion \n\nThe constitutive relations for the mass diffusion flux vector j, the \nheat flux vector q, and the viscous stress tensor S depend on the nature \nof the fluid under consideration. The objective of this section is to \ndevelop the correct form of the driving force for the mass diffusion. \n\nA general expression for the mass flux by diffusion (as well as \nheat and momentum diffusion) may be obtained from postulates of the \nThermodynamics of Irreversible Processes (TIP). Initially, however, \nan almost entirely continuum mechanics approach, based on the Species \nLinear Momentum equation (SLM), will be provided. This approach \n\n\n\n214 \n\nsuggests that the equation for the diffusive fluxes obtained from TIP, \nwhen applied to ideal gases, is a simplified form of the SLM, and the \nlater, with the equation for the conservation of mass of the species, \ncould be used to solve mass transfer problems. However, when dealing \nwith non-ideal multicomponent mixtures the approach from TIP \nprovides a more complete view. This is explored next. \n\n5.3.5.1 Derivation from the inversion of the species momentum \nequation \n\nOnly macroscopic arguments were invoked in the derivation of \nthe conservation of species linear momentum. Let\u2019s use now a minimum \nof molecular information to attempt a solution for the diffusion \nvelocities from the species linear momentum equation. The development \nwill follow closely Furry (1948) and Williams (1958) as reviewed by \nLam (2006). From the kinetic theory (CHAPMAN and COWLING, \n1991 ), it is suggested that the elastic collision term in Eq.

Lam (2006), on the other hand, finds a solution for Vi by \nmatrix inversion. Since ? ijK  is nonsingular, Eq.(5.113) can be inverted \n\nby multiplying both sides by the inverse matrix of ? ijK to obtain the \n\nvector for the diffusion velocities as \n\n?\n1\n\n1\n\ncN\ni i\n\nijj i i i i\n\ni\n\nd\nK\n\ndt\n? ?\n\n?\n\n=\n\n? ?? ?= ? ? ? +? ?? ? ? ?\n?\n\nu\nV T f????

The magnitude of this term depends on the choice of \nreference velocity, since ji  is calculated based on that reference.

This is the traditional approach taken by \nLightfoot and others to arrive at a form of the dissipation function valid \nwhen mechanical static equilibrium ( )p ?? f = 0????  is established faster \nthan thermal and chemical equilibrium. This approach is detailed next. \n\n5.3.5.3 Lightfoot formulation \n\nLightfoot formulation has been the starting point for models of \ntransport across membranes, such as in PEMFC. With this condition in \nmind, in the classical treatment, the dissipation function is manipulated \nin a way that the sum of the driving force for diffusion is forced to be \nzero. Following Lightfoot\u2019s original development (LIGHTFOOT, 1974), \nas well as further developments by Taylor and Krishna (1993) and \nKrishna and Wesselingh (1997) [in their Eq.

This model is constrained by the enforcement of the \nmechanical equilibrium hypothesis.  \n\nTo better appreciate the role of the assumption of faster \nmechanical static equilibrium, we can observe the application of the \nequation developed for the mass diffusion under the effect of body force. \n\nFirst, the diffusion under a centrifugal force field is considered. \nThe body force per unit mass applied on each species i is \n\n2\ni\n\n= ?f r    (6.43) \nwhere ? is the rotational speed (rad/s) and r is the position vector of the \nfluid particle in respect to the fixed axis of rotation.

(6.45) \nTherefore, from Eq.

(6.48) \nand the species distribution will be such that the chemical potential \ngradient balances the centripetal acceleration.

(6.57) \n\nand the species distribution will be such that the chemical potential \ngradient balances the electrical potential.

(6.59) \n\nFrom the two cases analyzed above, we observe that the pressure \ngradient term in the driving force for diffusion is directly related, by the \n\n\n\n236 \n\nmixture linear momentum equation, to an external body force, and not \nimposed by itself externally. Should the pressure gradient be imposed \nby some external means to overcome drag or viscous losses, the static \n\nequilibrium would not be granted (HAASE, 1969, pg. 231). Therefore, \nthe static equilibrium hypothesis difficults the treatment of flow near \nwalls, where the gradients in velocity become important and there is \nsignificant transport of linear momentum. \n\n6.3 COMPARISON OF DF TO SLM  \n\nIn order to compare the result from the dissipation function (DF) \nto the development from the species linear momentum equation \n(SLM), Eq. (5.136) is rewritten as \n\n( ) ( ),DFi i T p i i i i icR p Y p? \u00b5 ? ? ?= + ? ? ?Td f f? ? ?? ? ?? ? ?? ? ?  (6.60) \nFor ideal gas, \n\n( ) ( )DFi i i i icR p Y p? ?= ? ? ?Td f f? ?? ?? ?? ?   (6.61) \nThis can be compared directly to Eq. (6.42), that when cast in the same \nform becomes \n\n( ) ( ) ( )SLMi i i i i i icR p Y p k Y? ?= ? ? ? + ? ?Td f f S ? ? ?? ? ?? ? ?? ? ?  (6.62) \nEquations (6.60) and (6.62) are different forms for the driving \n\nforce for diffusion. The former generalizes for non-ideal solutions while \nthe later seems to be adequate only for ideal gases, but in the presence of \nviscous effects. Also, even for a mixture of ideal gases, the equations \nbecome equal only when \n\ni i\nk Y= , a assumption that has been discussed \n\nabove. \nTherefore, the addition of the mixture momentum equation to the \n\ndissipation function (multiplication of ( )p ?? f????  by iY  to obtain the \nLightfoot formulation), although allowing for invariance in respect to \nreference system, does not allow for the treatment of externally imposed \npressure gradients and has limited use for the transport in porous media.  \n\nOne possible heuristic improvement for the driving force for \ndiffusion obtained from the SLM would be to replace \n\ni\np????  by the more \n\ngeneral term that comes from DF \n,i T p i i p? \u00b5 ?+? ?? ?? ?? ?  obtaining \n\n( ) ( )\n( )\n\n(2)\n,\n\nSLM\n\ni i T p i i i i i\n\ni i\n\ncR p Y p\n\nk Y\n\n? \u00b5 ? ? ?= + ? ? ?\n\n? ? ?\n\nTd f f\n\nS \n\n? ? ?? ? ?? ? ?? ? ?\n\n????\n (6.63) \n\n\n\n237 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L.

The discussion of this equation will \n\nbe finalized at the end of the chapter. \nThe critique developed above indicates the need to isolate the \n\nformulation that leads to the minimum number of hypothesis needed to \nformulate the mass transport problem. In the next section this \nformulation is isolated, to be used in the next chapters.  \n\n6.4 DEVELOPMENT AND ANALYSIS OF A FORMULATION \nVALID FOR GENERAL MECHANICAL NON \nEQUILIBRIUM \n\nHere we propose to avoid the use of the hypothesis of mechanical \nequilibrium seeking a formulation with larger validity.

There is no experimental evidence that unbalance of shear stress \n\ncauses mass diffusion, as suggested by Eq. (6.112). \n2. There is no evidence that the constitutive relations presented \n\nabove, Eqs. (6.108) and (6.109) are valid, or, under what \ncircumstances they are valid. \n\n3. The HVMF hypothesis, given by Eq. (6.110), although \nreasonable, has no direct evidence. \n\nTherefore, in the developments that follow, Eq. (6.78), \n\n,\ni\n\nT p i i i\n\ni\n\ncRT\nv p\u00b5\n\n?\n= ? + ? ?\n\nd\nf     \n\n\n\n246 \n\nwill be used, knowing that, with all the consequences, \n\n1\n\n1\n( )\n\ncN\n\ni\n\ni\n\np\ncRT\n\n?\n=\n\n= ? ?? d f   (6.116) \nFor creeping flow, du/dt = 0, this results in \n\n1\n\n1\n.S\n\ncN\n\ni\n\ni cRT=\n= ? ?? d    (6.117) \n\nOne of the important consequences is that Eq. (5.149) is no \nlonger valid, since definition (5.148) can no longer be used. Therefore, \nthe derivation of the Maxwell-Stefan equation will become a purely \nmechanical derivation, based only on drag arguments. Since heat \ntransfer will not be addressed on the remaining, there is no need to \ndiscuss the implications in the definition of the heat transfer vector by \ndiffusion. \n\nIn the following, the mass transport in multiphase porous media \nis reviewed with the aim of modeling mass transport in the MEA of fuel \ncells.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nPart III \n \n\nMulticomponent, multiphase modeling of heat and \nmass transfer in porous layers of PEM fuel cells \n\n \nThe objectives of this third part are to review the modeling of mass \ntransport in porous media, to develop a general Maxwell-Stefan model \nfor two phase flow and mass diffusion in porous media and to apply this \nmodel to the basic mass transfer processes that occur in the porous \nlayers and membrane in PEM fuel cells.  \nInitially, the theories for mass transfer in porous media are reviewed, \nwith emphasis on the theories derived from the Maxwell-Stefan \napproach. Then, from the general expression for the Maxwell-Stefan \nmass diffusion, a general model for two-phase flow in porous media is \ndeveloped. Applications to simpler mass transfer processes are \npresented and used to elucidate the role of the bulk flow and the \npressure gradient. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 MODELING OF TRANSPORT IN POROUS MEDIA \n\nHere the emphasis is on low Reynolds and low Peclet number. \nThe low Reynolds number ensures that non-linear effects on the \nmomentum equation for the flow in porous medium can be neglected.  \nThe low Peclet number ensures that dispersion effects become \nnegligibly small when compared to diffusion effects \n\n7.1 VOLUME \u2013AVERAGE MODELS \n\nThe system under consideration is formed by three phases: a solid \n(phase ?) and two fluid phases (phases ? and ?). In the fuel cell \napplications, the fluid phases are liquid and gas. The pore space is \noccupied by the liquid and gas phases. The porosity ? is the ratio of the \nvolume of pore space divided by the total volume of the mixture, \n\nP\nV\n\nV\n? = .    (7.1) \n\nThe volume fraction ?? of each phase ? is defined as \nV\n\nV\n\n?\n?? = .    (7.2) \n\nFor ? = ?, ?, ?, the volume fraction of each phase is related to \nthe porosity ? and the liquid water saturation S by \n\n( )\n\n1\n\n1\n\nS\n\nS\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n? ?\n\n? ?\n\n? ?\n\n= ?\n\n=\n\n= ?\n\n    (7.3) \n\nwhere the saturation S is defined as the ratio of the volume occupied by \nthe liquid phase and the total volume  of the pore space. The \nconservation of the total volume leads to 1? ? ?? ? ?+ + = . \n\nWithin each phase ?, each species i occupies a mass fraction \n\n,iY ? and a mole fraction ,iX ? , following the common relation \n\n, ,i i\ni\n\nM\nX Y\n\nM\n\n?\n? ?=      (7.4) \n\n\n\n250 \n\nwhere Mi is the molar mass of species i (kg/kmol) and M? is the \n\nmolar mass of phase ?. In general, the ,ib ?  averaged velocity of phase \n\n?, denoted b?u , is defined as \n\n, ,\n1\n\nu u\nN\n\nb\ni i\n\ni\n\nb\n?\n\n? ? ?\n=\n\n= ?    (7.5) \n\nwhere ,ib ? is the averaging weight. When , ,i ib Y? ?= the mass averaged \nvelocity u?, or barycentric velocity, is recovered. \n\nThe volume-averaged of a property \ni\n??  for species i in phase ? \n\nis defined as \n\n, ,\n\n1\ni i\n\nV\ndV\n\nV\n? ?? ?= ?

(7.7) \nTherefore, the relation between volume-averaged and phasic \n\nvolume-averaged properties for phase ? is \n\n, ,i i\n\n?\n\n? ? ?? ? ?=  \n(7.8) \n\nThe phase property ,i ?? may be decomposed into an average and \na fluctuation following (GRAY, 1975) \n\n?\n,, ,\n\n?\n\n?? ?? ? ?= + ii i  \n(7.9) \n\nThe volume-averaging theory requires that \n\n, 0i ?? =?     (7.10) \nTwo important theorems allow for the volume-averaging of the \n\nlocal point-wise conservation equations.

Transform the volume-averaged variables appearing in the volume-\naveraged transport equations to intrinsic volume-averaged variables \nusing relations (7.8). \n\n4. Use Gray\u2019s decomposition, Eq. (7.9), and express the local \nvariables remaining in the area integrals in terms of intrinsic \naverages and fluctuations. \n\n5. Postulate transformations between the intrinsic volume-averaged \nvariables and the fluctuations, usually in the form of linear \ncombination of averages, difference of averages and gradient of \naverages. Higher order effects are usually neglected, since the \nproblem can easily escalate and become intractable. The results are \nthe volume- averaged equations and the definitions of the effective \ncoefficients. \n\n6.

The authors proceed to develop a mixture \nenergy equation, but this is beyond the objective of this section. They \nclaim that the important advantages of their model is the reduction \nof the number of equations to be solved by almost half and the \ntransformation of the formulation into equations the behavior if \nwhich can be easily interpreted and solved using well known \nalgorithms. The explicit representation of the capillary driven flow \nas a diffusive transport, as noted before by several authors in the \ncontext of moisture movement in porous media, is also an advantage \nin terms of comparison to older models (PHILLIP and DE VRIES, \n1957). \n\n7.1.3 Two-phase, miscible, multi-component flow \n\nSoulaine et al. (2011) derive equations for the multicomponent \nmass transport in two- phase flow in porous media. They start from the \n\n\n\n262 \n\nconservation of mass of species applied to the pore level assuming a \nmixture Fick model and incompressible viscous, i.e., low Reynolds, \nflow. Chemical reaction is neglected. At the phase interfaces, a linear \nrelation among the molar fractions, as in Raoult\u00b4s and Henry\u00b4s laws, \ndescribing chemical equilibrium is used. This equilibrium relation is \nexpressed in mass fractions in the form \n\n, , .i i iY H Y? ?=      \nThe equations for the conservation of mass and momentum \n\nof both phases remain the same as in the single-component two-\nphase flow. The equation for the conservation of mass of species i \nin phases ? and ? assumes a complicated form that requires the \nsolution of transient closure problems. The final form of the closure \nproblems depend on the phase interface velocity and its interaction \nwith the velocity and mass fraction fluctuations, becoming rather \ncomplicated. A simpler form of the final equation is obtained when \nthe closure problem is formulated under the assumption of \nincompressible fluids and stationary interface. \n\nIn this situation, they obtain the conservation of mass of \nspecies i in phase ? as \n\n( )\n( )\n\n( )\n[ ] ( ) [ ] ( )\n\n,\n\n,\n\n, ,\n\n, ,\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni i i\n\ni i\n\nY\nt\n\nY\n\nH Y Y\n\nD Y D Y m\n\n? ?\n? ? ?\n\n? ? ?\n? ? ? ?\n\n? ? ?\n? ? ? ? ?\n\n? ? ? ?\n? ? ?? ? ? ? ?? ? ??\n\n? ?\n\n? ?\n\n? ?\n\n? ? ? ?\n\n?\n+\n\n?\n\n? +\n\n? ?? ? =? ?? ?\n\n? ? ? ?? ? + ? ? ?? ? ? ?? ? ? ?\n\nu\n\nE\n\n?\n\n????\n\n????\n\n? ? ? ?? ? ? ?? ? ? ?? ? ? ?\n\n(7.76) \n\nIn the third term on the left-hand side, the velocity-like \ncoefficient E? arises from the mass fraction fluctuation across the \nphase interface dependence on the volume-averaged mass fraction. \nThe dispersion coefficient [ ]D?? retains the usual definition while the \ndispersion correction coefficient [ ]D??  arises from the mass fraction \nfluctuation across the phase interface dependence on the volume-\naveraged mass fraction gradient. These coefficients are evaluated \nfrom the solution of stationary, periodic closure problems, \nformulated in the absence of interfacial mass transport. This still \ncaptures the influence of a phase distribution into the mass transfer \nin the other phase. These simplifications are possible since the \nclosure problem must only capture characteristics of the most \n\n\n\n263 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E.

These have \nbroad applications in membrane science, from adsorption to fluid \nseparation, including ultrafiltration and diafiltration. The models are \ndeveloped to work from molecular (low Knudsen number) to continuum \nflow (high Knudsen number), using the minimum possible number of \nadjustable parameters. The starting points are usually Lightfoot\u2019s \ndevelopment and the dusty gas model of Mason and co-workers \n(MASON and MALINAUSKAS, 1983).

Larger species tend to congregate near \nthe center of the pore, then result in ?i > 1, while species that tend to \nstick at the pore walls result in ?i &lt;1.

Then, the ijC\n?  does not depend \n\ndirectly on the velocities themselves, but only on the species \nconcentrations. Therefore, this allows for the development of a \nfirst-order theory, and excludes, for example, second-order \neffects like pore-level inertia effects. Implicit in this condition \nis the concept that the flow of the mixture can be \nappropriately modeled by one equation of motion, which is \nbasically a one-component model of a multicomponent \nsystem. \n\u2022 Since the drag force among species acts both ways, \n\nij jiC C=? ?

The formulation for a problem with N \nspecies in M dimensions, in molar variables, requires: \n\nEquations Variables  Dimension \n\nMaxwell-Stefan J\ni\nor \n\ni\nn  M x N \n\nConservation of mass of species iX  N \n\nConservation of mass c 1 \nConservation of momentum u  M \nEquation of state p 1 \nTotal  (M x N) + N + M + 2 \n\n \nWhen M = 1, i.e, a one-dimensional problem, there are 2N + 3 \n\nequations and variables. A few one-dimensonal forms are explored in \nthe next sections.  \n\n\n\n284 \n\n8.4.1 Constant pressure, zero convective flow mass diffusion \n\nThe two bulb diffusion is a simple device that can be used to \nmeasure the diffusion coefficient in gas mixtures (Taylor and Krishna, \n1993). Both bulbs are filled with different gases and are connected by a \ncapillary tube with a stopcock. At t = 0, the valve is open and the gases \nare allowed to diffuse. Concentration measurements are taken in the two \nbulbs at different times. This bulb set up was used by Duncan and Toor \n(1962) with a ternary mixture of hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide \nin order to examine diffusion in an ideal ternary gas mixture. The \nexperiments evidenced the occurrence of diffusion fluxes of a species i \ncontrary to their own gradient of concentration. Figure 46 presents the \nsolution of the Maxwell-Stefan equations by Krishna and Wesselingh \n(1997) compared to the measurements of Duncan and Toor (1962). The \ninsert on top of the figure provides the initial concentrations of hydrogen \n(1), nitrogen (2) and carbon dioxide (3). The horizontal axis represents \nthe time after the valve is opened and the vertical axis is the transient \nmolar concentrations of (1) hydrogen and (2) nitrogen in bulbs A and B. \nIn spite of the equal concentrations (no driving force), there is an initial \nnitrogen diffusion flux from bulb A to bulb B, contrary to a Fickian \nmodel. This diffusion flux continues increasing the composition of bulb \nA at the expense of bulb B, in an up-hill direction (reverse diffusion) \nuntil both concentrations reach a plateau. This plateau is an evidence of \nnull flux despite the large gradient of nitrogen concentration that has \nbeen generated. Beyond this elapsed time the driving force is large \nenough to overcome the reverse diffusion effect and nitrogen diffuses \ndown its own concentration gradient. This curious nitrogen behavior is \ndue to the diffusional interaction effects with the other chemical species. \nThis behavior is well reproduced by the Maxwell Stefan equations, as \nshown by TAYLOR and KRISHNA (1993), KRISHNA and \nWESSENLINGH (1997) and AMUNDSON and PAULSEN (2003).  \n\n\n\n285 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L.

The mixture velocity \nat the vessel walls is zero and diffusion takes place primarily in a single \ndirection. As a result, since the initial pressure is uniform everywhere, \n\n( ), 0u t z = . Therefore, the mixture molar concentration is constant and \na description based on the molar center of reference makes the \nformulation simpler.  \n\nUsing a molar basis, the conservation of mass of a species i \nbecomes \n\n( ) ( ) 0i i icX cX\nt\n\n?\n+ ? + =\n\n?\nu J???? .

When the capillary has a large \ndiameter, the pressure may be assumed constant, even though there is a \nbulk fluid flow. There are several analyses available in the literature. \nAmong them, we refer to Bird et.al. (1962), Taylor and Krishna (1993), \nWhitaker (1999) and Kerkhof (1997). A careful experiment was \nperformed by Carty and Schrodt (1975). \n\nIn the traditional configuration, a pool of quiescent liquid, which \ncan be a pure substance (forming a binary gas mixture) or a convenient \nmixture (forming a multicomponent gas mixture), remains at constant \nlevel and concentration in the bottom of the tube. Vapor of this liquid \ndiffuses up-ward towards the open end in the top of the tube. At the top, \na stream of gas flows across the opening and sweeps away the vapor, \napproximating a condition of constant concentration. The mole fraction \n\n\n\n288 \n\nof the vapor at the vapor-liquid interface is its equilibrium value at the \nliquid surface temperature. This device is sometimes used for measuring \ndiffusion coefficient in binary vapor mixtures. \n\nA simple solution is available when the problem is isothermal, \nthe pressure is constant, the liquid pool surface is kept stationary, phase \nequilibrium prevails and the liquid is impermeable to air. The surface \nmole fraction is obtained from the ratio of the saturation and total \nAssuming that the gas is ideal, the formulation of the model becomes \nthe same as above (which is repeated here for clarity), \n\n( )\n1,\n\n1N i\nk i i k\n\nikk k i\n\nX\nX X c\n\nD z\n\n?\n\n= ?\n\n?\n? = ?\n\n?\n?

The \neffect of the pressure variation affects the boundary condition at the \nliquid surface, lowering the magnitude of the binary diffusivities and \noriginating a driving force for diffusion.  \n\nThe effect of pressure becomes important as the diameter of the \nStefan tube decreases. The bulk flow induced by diffusion is subjected \nto a pressure drop as the mixture flows down the tube. The bulk \nvelocity distribution, under the no-slip condition at the tube walls \n(large Knudsen approximation), is two dimensional and obtained from \nthe solution of the Conservation of Momentum equation, i.e., the \nNavier-Stokes equation. The velocity profile, in turn, will induce \nradial variations of the mole fraction (HEINZELMANN et al., \n1965; RAO and BENNET, 1966; MEYER and KOSTIN, 1975). \nHere, we intend to keep a strictly one-dimensional problem. With \nthis objective, the bulk flow will be assumed fully developed, laminar \nand with constant properties. In this Poiseuille flow, the mass \naveraged velocity is related to the pressure drop as \n\n2\n\n32\n\nd dp\nu\n\ndz\u00b5\n= ?      (8.115) \n\n\n\n291 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E.

The model \nintegrates the transport in the gas diffusion layer, micro-porous layer, \ncatalytic layer and membrane into a single Maxwell-Stefan framework.  \n\nThis work was divided into three parts.  \nIn the first part, the behavior of PEM fuel cells based on current \n\nthermodynamics and electrochemical models is reviewed. A thorough \ndescription of the characteristics and typical length scales of the \ndifferent components of the fuel cell was presented in order to obtain \nfundamental information to help the development of phenomenological \nmodels. The models available in the literature were classified and \nreviewed. The experimental analysis of a 200 W fuel cell stack, using \nthe polarization curve method, allowed to study the basic behavior and \nmagnitude of the variables involved in the fuel cell design and \noperation. The fuel cell in this work operated exclusively in the \nactivation and ohmic losses regime. The measured polarization curve \nwas analyzed and reproduced using a lumped-component model. \nInitially, since the measurements did not cover the mass transfer limited \nregime, the lumped-component model was validated using data from the \nliterature, employing a one-dimensional mass transfer treatment. This \nmodel was then applied to reproduce the measurements in this work, \nobtaining the correspondent set of constants that characterizes the \npresent fuel cell stack. \n\nIn the second part of the work, in order to progress towards more \ncomprehensive models, the conservation equations for mass and linear \nmomentum transport in multicomponent fluids were derived based on \nthermodynamics and continuum mechanics. The focus was on \ndetermining the correct form for the driving forces for diffusion for a \nmixture in creeping flow. Traditional models have assumed local \nmechanical equilibrium, and the extension for nonequilibrium is \nthoroughly discussed. After obtaining a general form for the driving \nforce, the Maxwell-Stefan equations were derived from purely \nmechanical arguments.  \n\nFinally, in the third part the models reviewed in part II provided \nthe basis for the development of a general homogeneous model for the \ntransport of liquid, gas and chemical species in a porous medium, under \n\n\n\n296 \n\nthe action of pressure and electrical potentials. This model is completely \nexpressed in a single matrix form, allowing for the solution of the \nspecies, liquid and gas fluxes in and out of the MEA. A few simplified \nproblems were addressed in order to clarify the roles of the bulk \nconvective flow and the pressure gradient.  \n\nThe main conclusions of this work are presented in the following. \nThe available models for fuel cells have been developed focusing \n\none of the following purposes: To help to understand the internal \nphysics and chemistry of fuel cells; to focus experimental development \nefforts; to support system design and optimization; to support or form \nthe basis of control algorithms; to evaluate the technical and economic \nsuitability of fuel cell applications. Models also help with the \nunderstanding of the effect of parameters on the fuel cells performance.  \n\nThe literature review revealed the vast amount of information that \nexists in PEM fuel cell modeling and simulation. Most of the recent \nworks are improvements of the earlier models and implementations \nknown as Computational Fuel Cell Dynamics \u2013CFCD. They explore \nmultidimensional and multiphysics effects. The higher computational \ncapacity available today allows to use more refined grids, explore more \ndetailed geometries and to develop optimization routines aimed at \noptimizing certain design or operation features. The basic \nphenomenology, however, has remained unchanged, based on the \nclassical mass and charge transport models.  \n\nRarely the fuel cell models focus on specific behavior of fuel cell \ncomponents on attempts to better understand the role of micro and nano \nphenomena on the macroscopic output. The major difficulty in using the \navailable detailed models and interpreting their results is that the large \nsuperposition and interrelation of different modeling principles, with \ndifferent requirements, produces a very rich macroscopic picture with \nsometimes over-simplified local features and, in this sense, they lose \ntheir generality.  \n\nThe application of a simple lumped model was able to reproduce \nthe data from the literature for different reactants temperatures and \npressures. It provided the parameters needed to predict the polarization \ncurve for the entire range of temperatures and pressures with a single set \nof constants. Using order of magnitude arguments, these values \npresented good qualitative agreement to estimates from known mass \ntransfer relations. The modeling with an overall model allowed the \nunderstanding of basic fuel cell behavior as well as, to estimate the \ntypical magnitudes of fluxes, potentials and global transport parameters. \n\n\n\n297 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L. E. Thesis LabCET-PosMEC-UFSC \n\nThis basic footwork established the need for developing a more basic \nmass transport modeling of the MEA.  \n\nThe treatment used here consisted in developing the constitutive \nrelations for mass transfer in the context of the Maxwell-Stefan \nformulation for a general concentration, pressure, temperature and body \nforce (e.g., electrical) driving potential. The traditional derivations based \non the dissipation function and the species linear momentum equation \nlead to basically different formulations that can be brought together only \nunder very restrictive assumptions. The common formulations for the \ndiffusion flux as a result of unbalanced shear stress, constitutive \nrelations for the species diffusion flux of linear momentum and the \nequality of mixture and species velocities find no direct evidence. This \nlead to the conclusion that, in a general framework, only the basic \ndriving force for diffusion,  \n\n \n\n,\ni\n\nT p i i i\n\ni\n\ncRT\nv p\u00b5\n\n?\n= ? + ? ?\n\nd\nf  \n\ncan be safely used, knowing that, with all the consequences, \n\n1\n\n1\n( )\n\ncN\n\ni\n\ni\n\np\ncRT\n\n?\n=\n\n= ? ?? d f  \nFor creeping flow, du/dt = 0, and \n\n1\n\n1\n.\n\ncN\n\ni\n\ni cRT=\n= ? ?? d S  \n\nOne of the important consequences is that the well-known \nLightfoot formulation is no longer valid. In this context, therefore, the \nderivation of the Maxwell-Stefan equation becomes a purely mechanical \nderivation, based only on drag arguments.  \n\nThe general model for two-phase, multicomponent flow in porous \nmedia was developed limited for low Reynolds and low Peclet number. \nThe low Reynolds number ensures that non-linear effects on the \nmomentum equation for the flow in porous medium can be neglected.  \nThe low Peclet number ensures that dispersion effects become \nnegligibly small when compared to diffusion effects. Following a \nMaxwell-Stefan framework, for a system composed of N? chemical \nspecies in the gas phase (?), a liquid phase (?) and a solid phase (?), the \nvolume- averaged dynamic equilibrium for a fluid particle of species i in \nphase ? can be expressed as \n\n\n\n298 \n\n( )\n\n( ) ( )\n\n( )\n\n, , , ,\n\n1,\n\n, , , ,\n\n, , , , ,\n\nN\n\nik i k i k\n\nk k i\n\ni i i i\n\ni T p i i i\n\nY Y\nK K\n\nY v p\n\n?\n\n? ? ? ? ?\n\n? ?? ? ??\n? ? ? ? ? ?\n\n?? ??\n\n? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n\n? ? ? ?\n\n? \u00b5 ? \u00b5\n\n? ? \u00b5\n\n= ?\n\n? +\n\n? + ? =\n\n? + ?\n\n? u u\n\nu u u u\n\nf? ?? ?? ?? ?\n\n \n\nThe model captured the interactions among species and phases. \nAdding up the velocity fields for the species within each phase, the \nphase momentum equations were recovered, where K?? and K?? are \nphase permeabilities. All the equations could be set in a single matrix \nformulation, allowing for a fully coupled solution.  \n\nThe general model developed reduced to the well-known forms \nof Darcy\u00b4s law for single phase flow in porous media and the extended \nforms of Darcy\u00b4s law for two-phase flow in porous media. The \ntreatment of the effect of the pressure gradient arose naturally from the \nequations, without the need to create additional bulk flow terms. Once \nthe correct simplifications are applied the model reduces to the known \nsimple solutions for the Stefan tube and the two-bulb diffusion \nproblems.  \n\nThe general formulation could be reduced to other models from \nthe literature, as the binary friction model, evidencing the meaning of \nthe transport parameters. The application to simpler mass diffusion \nproblems, as the two-bulb and the Stefan problem, recovered, under the \ncorrect assumptions, the simpler well known solutions. These simple \nproblems elucidated the roles of the bulk convective flow and the \npressure gradient. The general model developed can capture the pressure \neffects without resorting to additional ad-hoc terms.  \n\nHere a direct validation was not attempted. The literature \nprovides a vast amount of information that could be used to develop and \nvalidate a general computer code. This development is deferred for \nfuture work.  \n\nThe following suggestions for future work are listed: \n1. Program and perform a full validation of the \n\ncomputational code against analytical solutions, \nsolutions from the literature and measurements for \nbinary and ternary mass diffusion problems, in gas and \nliquid phases. \n\n\n\n299 \n\n2012 Garcia\u2013Acevedo L.
