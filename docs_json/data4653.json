In the oil and gas industry, a large\namount of data is generated every day from multiple sources such as seismic data, well data,\ndrilling data, transportation data, and marketing data. However, these data are acquired by the\napplication of different techniques and represented in different standards and formats. Thus,\nthese data exist in a structured form in databases, and in semi-structured forms in spreadsheets\nand documents such as reports and multimedia collections. To deal with this large amount of\ninformation, as well as the heterogeneous data formats of the data, the information needs to\nbe standardized and integrated across systems, disciplines and organizational boundaries. As\na result, this information integration will enable better decision making within collaborations,\nonce high quality data will be accessible timely.\n\nThe petroleum industry depends on the efficient use of these data to the construction of\ncomputer models in order to simplify the geological reality and to help understanding it. Such\na model, which contains geological objects analyzed by different professionals \u2013 geologists,\ngeophysicists and engineers \u2013 does not represent the reality itself, but the expert\u2019s conceptual-\nization. As a result, the geological objects modeled assume distinct semantic representations\nand complementary in supporting decision-making. For keeping the original intended mean-\nings, ontologies were used for expliciting the semantic of the models and for integrating the\ndata and files generated in the various stages of the exploration chain.\n\nThe major claim of this work is that interoperability among earth models built and manipu-\nlated by different professionals and systems can be achieved by making apparent the meaning\nof the geological objects represented in the models. We show that domain ontologies developed\nwith support of theoretical background of foundational ontologies show to be an adequate tool\nto clarify the semantic of geology concepts. We exemplify this capability by analyzing the com-\nmunication standard formats most used in the modeling chain (LAS, WITSML, and RESQML),\nsearching for entities semantically related with the geological concepts described in ontologies\nfor Geosciences. We show how the notions of identity, rigidity, essentiality and unity applied\nto ontological concepts lead the modeler to more precisely define the geological objects in the\nmodel. By making explicit the identity properties of the modeled objects, the modeler who ap-\nplies data standards can overcome the ambiguities of the geological terminology. In doing that,\nwe clarify which are the relevant objects and properties that can be mapped from one model to\nanother, even when they are represented with different names and formats.\n\nKeywords: Geological data integration. communication standard formats. conceptual model-\ning. ontology. foundational ontology. geological objects mapping.\n\n\n\nRESUMO\n\nAbordagem baseada em ontologias para integra\u00e7\u00e3o de formatos padr\u00f5es em modelagem\nde reservat\u00f3rios\n\nA integra\u00e7\u00e3o de dados oriundos de fontes aut\u00f4nomas e heterog\u00eaneas ainda \u00e9 um grande\nproblema para diversas aplica\u00e7\u00f5es. Na ind\u00fastria de petr\u00f3leo e g\u00e1s, uma grande quantidade de\ndados \u00e9 gerada diariamente a partir de m\u00faltiplas fontes, tais como dados s\u00edsmicos, dados de po-\n\u00e7os, dados de perfura\u00e7\u00e3o, dados de transporte e dados de marketing. No entanto, estes dados s\u00e3o\nadquiridos atrav\u00e9s da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de diferentes t\u00e9cnicas e representados em diferentes formatos\ne padr\u00f5es. Assim, estes dados existem de formas estruturadas em banco de dados e de formas\nsemi-estruturadas em planilhas e documentos, tais como relat\u00f3rios e cole\u00e7\u00f5es multim\u00eddia. Para\nlidar com a heterogeneidade dos formatos de dados, a informa\u00e7\u00e3o precisa ser padronizada e\nintegrada em todos os sistemas, disciplinas e fronteiras organizacionais. Como resultado, este\nprocesso de integra\u00e7\u00e3o permitir\u00e1 uma melhor tomada de decis\u00e3o dentro de colabora\u00e7\u00f5es, uma\nvez que dados de alta qualidade poder\u00e3o ser acessados em tempo h\u00e1bil.\n\nA ind\u00fastria do petr\u00f3leo depende do uso eficiente desses dados para a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de mode-\nlos computacionais, a fim de simplificar a realidade geol\u00f3gica e para ajudar a compreende-la.\nTal modelo, que cont\u00e9m objetos geol\u00f3gicos analisados por diferentes profissionais \u2014 ge\u00f3logos,\ngeof\u00edsicos e engenheiros \u2014 n\u00e3o representa a realidade propriamente dita, mas a conceitualiza-\n\u00e7\u00e3o do especialista. Como resultado, os objetos geol\u00f3gicos modelados assumem representa\u00e7\u00f5es\nsem\u00e2nticas distintas e complementares no apoio \u00e0 tomada de decis\u00f5es. Para manter os signifi-\ncados pretendidos originalmente, ontologias est\u00e3o sendo usadas para explicitar a sem\u00e2ntica dos\nmodelos e para integrar os dados e arquivos gerados nas etapas da cadeia de explora\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nA principal reivindica\u00e7\u00e3o deste trabalho \u00e9 que a interoperabilidade entre modelos da terra\nconstru\u00eddos e manipulados por diferentes profissionais e sistemas pode ser alcan\u00e7ada eviden-\nciando o significado dos objetos geol\u00f3gicos representados nos modelos. N\u00f3s mostramos que\nontologias de dom\u00ednio desenvolvidas com o apoio de conceitos te\u00f3rico de ontologias de fun-\ndamenta\u00e7\u00e3o demonstraram ser uma ferramenta adequada para esclarecer a sem\u00e2ntica dos con-\nceitos geol\u00f3gicos. N\u00f3s exemplificamos essa capacidade atrav\u00e9s da an\u00e1lise dos formatos de\ncomunica\u00e7\u00e3o padr\u00f5es mais utilizados na cadeia de modelagem (LAS, WITSML e RESQML),\nem busca de entidades semanticamente relacionadas com os conceitos geol\u00f3gicos descritos em\nontologias de Geoci\u00eancias. Mostramos como as no\u00e7\u00f5es de identidade, rigidez, essencialidade e\nunidade, aplicadas a conceitos ontol\u00f3gicos, conduzem o modelador \u00e0 definir mais precisamente\nos objetos geol\u00f3gicos no modelo. Ao tornar expl\u00edcitas as propriedades de identidade dos obje-\ntos modelados, o modelador pode superar as ambiguidades da terminologia geol\u00f3gica. Ao fazer\nisso, explicitamos os objetos e propriedades relevantes que podem ser mapeados a partir de um\nmodelo para outro, mesmo quando eles est\u00e3o representados em diferentes nomes e formatos.\n\nPalavras-chave: integra\u00e7\u00e3o de dados geol\u00f3gicos, formatos de comunica\u00e7\u00e3o padr\u00f5es, ontolo-\ngias, ontologias de fundamenta\u00e7\u00e3o, mapeamento de objetos geol\u00f3gicos.\n\n\n\nLIST OF FIGURES\n\n1.1 A Fault being represented differently along the modeling chain. . . . . . . 14\n\n1.2 The many categories of data used by an oil company (from Data Manage-\nment Value Study). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\n\n1.3 Summary of trends for terms in OnePetro (from Data Management Value\nStudy). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18\n\n2.1 The viewpoints of information systems interoperability\n[Fileto and Medeiros 2003]. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22\n\n2.2 Three dimensions of heterogeneity (adapted from\n[Benerecetti, Bouquet and Ghidini 2000]). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24\n\n2.3 Data Warehouse related tools and systems. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 28\n\n2.4 Three ways for connecting ontologies to information sources (adapted from\n[Wache et al. 2001]). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32\n\n2.5 GAV and LAV approaches [Buccella, Cechich and Fillottrani 2009]. . . . . 33\n\n3.1 UFO fragment that represents the fundamental distinctions between urele-\nment and set, and universal and individual [Guizzardi 2005]. . . . . . . . . 38\n\n3.2 UFO fragment that represents the distinctions between endurant and per-\ndurant universals and individuals and between substantial and moment uni-\nversals and individuals [Guizzardi 2005]. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 39\n\n3.3 Representation of the relationship between substance universals, quality\nuniversals and quality dimensions.

with petroleum exploration activities, such as 3D seismic interpretation, well bore drilling,\nreservoir modeling and monitoring and also plant/facility modeling or monitoring capabilities\n[Mastella 2010]. These data are routinely collected and stored in a structured form in databases,\nand in semi-structured forms in spreadsheets and documents, such as reports and multimedia\ncollections, of many organizations. As a consequence, these data are complex in nature, often\npoorly organized and duplicated, and exist in different formats [Ge et al. 2011].\n\nAt present, engineers are faced to the challenge of having access to all information about\ntheir domain, in order to make well-informed decisions. Moreover, modelers from different\ndisciplines, which must be able to share their diverse views of the world, face problems that\nmake integration difficult to support. Especially for the petroleum exploration activity, where\nthe acquisition, distribution and use of expert knowledge are more critical for the decision-\nmaking. When they intend to face the above challenges, geoscientists and modelers must face\na difficulty of huge importance: data heterogeneity. To deal with this large amount of infor-\nmation, as well as the heterogeneous data formats, the information needs to be standardized\nand integrated across systems, disciplines and organizational boundaries. However, integrating\nthese heterogeneous data to capitalize on their information value has been complex and costly\n[Chum 2007].\n\nThe typical information integration solution to provide a uniform interface to a collection\nof heterogeneous information sources, giving users the illusion that there is a centralized and\nhomogeneous information system, works well for activities in which the sources are static. In\nthe case where the data sources and formats are constantly evolving, the integration needs to be\nfounded in the semantic of the data and the tools used to the construction of computer models\nneed to be dissociated from the data sources and formats. In this context, integration means\nfinding correspondence between entities from different fields, without merging the correspond-\ning instances. The experts from these domains, in particular those from the petroleum industry,\nneed data to remain where they are, and to keep their original format, which can differ com-\npletely from one field to the other. What they aim is to be able to have an integrated vision of the\ndata issued from all the different fields [Mastella 2010]. They need a semantic-based integrated\nvision of the data. The semantic-based integration approach must take into consideration the\nmeaning of the various data for the experts, in order to define mapping rules. In addition, the\ninvolved experts need to agree upon a common vocabulary for communicating and also need\nto describe the meaning of data and data formats within models. Thus, making evident the\nsemantics of the related information and data. Also, correspondence among models should be\noperated by means of meaningful descriptions, which should be detached from the physical part\nof the models [Mastella 2010].\n\nIn order to take advantage of the value of the information contained in those data presented\n\n\n\n14\n\nin different formats, engineers rely on simulations (and hence simulation models) to make im-\nportant operational decisions on a daily basis. Three problems that are commonly encountered\nin model based oil field operations are [Soma et al. 2008]: on-demand access to information,\nintegrated view of information, and knowledge management.\n\nThe problems of on-demand access and information integration arise because a number of\ndifferent kinds of simulation models are created and used. Since these models are created by\ndifferent processes and people, the same information could be represented differently across\nmodels. The geological concept named Fault, for instance, can be represented differently along\nthe modeling chain (Figure 1.1).\n\nFigure 1.1: A Fault being represented differently along the modeling chain.\n\nA unified view of the models and their simulations is desirable for decision making, and\nthus the necessity for information integration. The problem of knowledge management refers\nto a systematic way to capture the rationale (knowledge) behind the various analyses performed\nby an engineer and decisions taken based on the analyses. It is critical to capture this knowledge\nfor auditing, archiving, and training purposes [Soma et al. 2008].\n\nIn the case of descriptions related to field outcrops, well core samples and rock thin sections,\ni.e., geological observations, they will hardly rest on models that would only be expressed by\nrepresentations based on textual languages. Geologists solve problems by using for a good\npart their visual knowledge [Lorenzatti et al. 2011]. In these cases, the geologist captures the\nspatial arrangement and visual aspects of various geological entities for interpreting his/her ob-\nservations. This way of thinking plays an important role for allowing the geologist building\nhis/her conceptual model [Abel et al. 2004]. Geological observation and earth model building\ntherefore require representations at least partly being based on graphical and pictorial represen-\ntation languages. Accordingly, visualization tools are important means for allowing geologists\nto communicate.\n\nIn order to deal with the complexity of the world to be interpreted, geologists create mental\nmodels involving various geological objects. A model, which is an abstraction of a portion of\nthe reality, emphasizes certain aspects of entities that exist in the world and that are relevant\naccording to the modeler point of view [Guizzardi 2005]. Abstraction is the mental process\nthat we use when we select some characteristics and properties of a set of objects, and exclude\nother characteristics that are not relevant [Batini, Ceri and Navathe 1992]. A model is built\nin the modeler\u2019s mind according to some conceptualization or theory. A conceptualization\n\n\n\n15\n\ndesignates the internal mental reference that a particular individual abstracts and keeps in mind\nregarding the world around [Perrin and Rainaud 2013]. A geologist, for instance, creates in his\nmind abstract objects related to real world objects like geological units or boundaries, faults,\nsedimentary basins and geological reservoirs. Thus, a model designates some individualized\npart of a conceptualization. However, both conceptualizations and models are abstract entities\nthat only exist in the geologists\u2019 mind. In order to be documented, communicated and analyzed,\nthey need to be externalized in specifications, using a modeling language that designates the\nset of rules that defines in which way the representation should be coded/decoded for being\nunderstood both by the modeler and the receptor of the model. Thus, representation is one of\nthe arbitrary forms in which the modeler expresses the model according to the language that\nhe/she has chosen. The set of shared concepts into the geologist\u2019s mind and the correspondent\nexternal representations are what we call an ontology.\n\nThe term Ontology has its origin in philosophy where it was defined as a particular the-\nory about the nature of being or the kinds of existents [Guizzardi 2005]. In the Computer\nScience context, the term ontology is used with two different meanings: (1) an artifact that\nrepresents a portion of reality according to the theory of existence [Gruber 2003]; (2) a logical\ntheory accounting for the intended meaning of a formal vocabulary utilized for representation\n[Guarino 1998]. An ontology can be used for information integration and supporting applica-\ntions in the first meaning, i.e., as an artifact (a model specified in a language and stored in a\nfile), where the ontology can represent a domain. It is important to note that the ontology as an\nartifact should be built to express the common understanding of a community about the exis-\ntence of beings. The ontology as a theory provides the support to build models that capture this\nunderstanding.\n\nEarth models, that are three- (3D) or four-dimension (4D) representations of data and in-\nterpretation concerning subsurface resources, are key tools for identifying and characterizing\npotential hydrocarbon reservoirs. They are developed by geoscientists who are responsible for\nevolving a hydrocarbon prospect through various stages of modeling. This chain of activities,\nwhich starts with data acquisition and proceeds with several different steps of data analysis and\ninterpretation, can be classified according to the purpose of the model under construction. Ac-\ncording to [Perrin and Rainaud 2013], reservoirs can be studied from various points of view:\ngeometry, rock quality and fluids. The study of reservoirs geometry is necessary for identify-\ning possible reservoir sites and evaluating the volume of their envelope. Thus, the geometry\nis a key factor for determining the location of hydrocarbon traps. The following study is to\nidentify if the located reservoirs have high-porosity rocks that may be potential reservoir rocks\nand impermeable rocks than serve as efficient covers. Also, to evaluate deposit conditions to\ndetermine whether source rocks are present in the sedimentary basin and whether conditions are\nfavorable for the trapping and maturation of organic matter within the rocks. Finally, the study\nof fluids aims to simulate fluid migration and the evolution of reservoir content for evaluating\nthe quantity of oil or gas that can be extracted. Therefore, the final goal of the modeling process\n\n\n\n16\n\nis the building of a reservoir model, which will be used for simulating oil accumulation in the\nunderground. Currently, this final model is connected to the original raw data by a long chain\nof successive interpretations realized by various groups of experts (e.g., geophysicists, struc-\ntural geologists, reservoir engineers, etc.) who may have different conceptualizations about the\nmodeled objects.\n\nExperts involved in the modeling process use heterogeneous data management environments\nthat rest on various data representations and encoding conventions for dealing with the same\ninformation in different parts of the workflow. Moreover, the data used in one modeling activity,\ncommonly, must be exchanged for other activities, containing the aggregate information already\nacquired. Clearly, there is a need of a non-conventional semantic integration approach.\n\nIn order to facilitate this integration process, intensive development efforts have been made\nin order to provide highly interactive and user-friendly tools to use these data effectively. Due to\nsuch intense development efforts, the oil companies end up using a variety of software, but that\nonly integrate and share data among applications of the same vendor. This scenario, where the\nsoftware providers have intended to cover as much as they could all the steps of the reservoir\ncharacterization workflow, did not last long due the complexity of the reservoir modeling pro-\ncess and the quick technological evolution. Taking advantage of this situation, small software\nproviders have also specialized in some \u201cniches\u201d of excellence, offering products that need to\ncommunicate with others. In order to face this interoperability problem, many efforts have been\nmade to create file format standards to transfer of information from one application to another.\n\n1.1 Research motivations\n\nAs each category of data is acquired, edited, interpreted and distributed, it moves from one\nrepository to another. Each of these locations makes the data accessible to different groups\nof potential users. An integration approach to deal with these heterogeneous sources is still\na significant problem in the petroleum industry, which is facing the problem of information\noverload (Figure 1.2). Use these massive volumes of data effectively is becoming a major\nchallenge for this type of industry. At present, the petroleum businesses already consider data\nas a valuable asset and recognize that it has to be managed as an asset like the other assets in their\nbusiness, like the wells, the facilities and the platforms. Moreover, all oil companies understand\nthat data is crucial to their operations. This new way of thinking is bringing major investments to\nthe area of integration and data management. Rainaud et al., in [Rainaud et al. 2005], estimated\nthat 43% from the total budget of petroleum is currently dedicated to information integration.\n\nA recent study about data management value1, commissioned by CDA2 and performed by\nSchlumberger3, found that the way that subsurface information is managed has significant im-\n\n1http://www.oilandgasuk.co.uk/datamanagementvaluestudy/\n2http://www.cdal.com/\n3http://www.slb.com/\n\n\n\n17\n\nFigure 1.2: The many categories of data used by an oil company (from Data Management Value\nStudy).\n\npact on the overall performance of E&amp;P companies. Participants in the study estimated that\n\u201cbetween a quarter and a third of all new value generated by typical E&amp;P companies can be\ndirectly attributed to the subsurface data they hold\u201d. Some of the study conclusion is that data\nholds a pre-eminent place alongside people, work processes and IT applications in developing\nan understanding of the subsurface, which strongly and directly affects business performance.\nThus, a review of current practices concerning data quality, access and indexing systems, data\npreservation, security and data governance would reveal substantial opportunities to increase\nthe total value that E&amp;P companies generate. Furthermore, data management nowadays has\nbecome an increasingly \u201ctransverse\u201d domain and should integrate the different disciplines: ge-\nology; geophysics; reservoir; and IT as well.\n\nAnother research motivation is the growing recognition of the importance of data manage-\nment and use of new technologies (e.g., witsml, ontology, smartfield) in journals and confer-\nences dedicated to E&amp;P business issues. Figure 1.3 summarizes the most active terms used\nover the last few years in the OnePetro4 library. The terms listed in the top right hand corner are\nthose that are both recent and growing strongly in usage, showing the importance of information\nmanagement.\n\nIntense efforts were developed, during the last years, by various organizations (geological\nsurveys, geoscience consortia, oil companies) for issuing codifications and formalizations of\ngeological knowledge. Moreover, the evolution of the technology motivated and enabled the\n\n4OnePetro.org is a multi-society library that provides access a broad range of technical literature related to the\noil and gas exploration and production industry, not least the Society of Petroleum Engineers and World Petroleum\nCongress. The site indexes more than 85,000 E&amp;P related documents.\n\n\n\n18\n\nFigure 1.3: Summary of trends for terms in OnePetro (from Data Management Value Study).\n\ncreation of new file format standards to exchange geological information among the many ac-\ntivities related to reservoir modeling process. However, it is very difficult to some oil company\nalready familiarized with some consolidated standard to start using a new one. The use of\nontologies to determine if files represented in different format standards contain semantically\nrelated information has recently been used to overcome the problem of semantic heterogene-\nity, since they allow one to clarify the meaning of the represented concepts according to the\nintention of the geologists. Ontologies are important because they provide a shared and com-\nmon understanding of data within a problem/solution domain, and by organizing and sharing\nenterprise information, as well as managing content and knowledge, they allow \u201cbetter interop-\nerability and integration of intra- and inter-company information systems\u201d [Chum 2007].\n\nThus, the oil and gas industry becomes a potentially rich domain for semantic approaches in\ndata modeling. Ontology-driven information integration and delivery leverage rich extensible\ndomain ontologies found in the oil &amp; gas industry, and combine them with industry standard\ndefinitions and controlled vocabularies. This results in meaningful metadata that reflects the\nconcepts relevant to the domain.\n\n1.2 Objectives\n\nIn this work, we claim that interoperability among earth models built and manipulated by\ndifferent professionals and systems can be achieved by making apparent the meaning of the\n\n\n\n19\n\ngeological objects represented in the models. We show that domain ontologies developed with\nsupport of theoretical background of foundational ontologies show to be an adequate tool to\nclarify the semantics of geology concepts. We exemplify this capability by analyzing the com-\nmunication standard formats most used in the modeling chain (LAS, WITSML and RESQML),\nsearching for entities semantically related with the geological concepts described in ontologies\nfor Geosciences, in order to make explicit the nature and properties of the geological objects\nfound in each format. We aim to identify which entities in the model can be mapped from one\napplication to another. We will restrict our analysis to the exploration steps of the petroleum\nchain, although we could later extend the study to cover production too.\n\nTherefore, the main objective of this work is:\n\nClarify the semantics of geology concepts presented in communication standard\n\nformats most used in the reservoir modeling chain applying a theoretical back-\n\nground of foundational ontologies, in order to identify which entities in the model\n\nare able to be mapped from one application to another.\n\nThis objective evokes the exploration of some specific points:\n\n\u2022 Survey of available ontologies built for Geosciences;\n\u2022 survey of the most used communication standard formats in petroleum exploration steps;\n\u2022 analysis of the communication standard formats found looking for mappable concepts to\n\nthose found ontologies;\n\n\u2022 classification of geology concepts according to foundational ontologies primitives.\n\n1.3 Organization of the master thesis\n\nThis work is organized as follows. Chapter 2 provides background for our research in infor-\nmation integration, presenting basic concepts related with information systems interoperability\nand types of heterogeneity problems that might arise due to heterogeneity of the data. It ex-\nplains the information integration process and presents the most typical information integration\nsystems. Chapter 3 presents the use of ontologies in the conceptual modeling process and show\nhow the use of properties from foundational ontologies can lead the modeler to more precisely\ndefine the geological objects in the model. Also, it presents the UFO, a top-level ontology\nthat supports our work. Chapter 4 provides an overview of the basic concepts related with the\npetroleum formation and the data derived from the E&amp;P activities. It also presents more details\nabout the earth modeling activity for petroleum exploration. Chapter 5 presents several domain\nontologies that were developed in the domain of Geology and petroleum exploration in the last\nfew years, with a special regard to the Basic Geology ontology [Mastella 2010]. This chap-\nter also presents our modified version of the Basic Geology Ontology based on the analysis\nperformed in its sub-ontologies. Chapter 6 describes in more details the analyzed communi-\ncation standard formats, presenting the results of the analysis performed with LAS, WITSML\n\n\n\n20\n\nand RESQML. The final chapter concludes by summarizing the results and contributions of this\nwork and by pointing out possible future work.\n\n\n\n21\n\n2 INFORMATION INTEGRATION\n\nToday, every business, organization, and individual routinely deals with a broad range of\ndata sources. Almost any professional or business task we undertake causes us to integrate in-\nformation from some subset of those sources. The concept of data or information integration is\nconcerned with unifying data that share some common semantic but are originating from unre-\nlated sources [Calvanese and Giacomo 2005]. This increasing need of dealing with information\nfrom multiple data sources is turning the process of information integration being the corner-\nstone of modern business informatics, and has made the problem of data integration arising as\na new research challenge.\n\nThe so-called information society demands for complete access to available information,\nwhich is often heterogeneous and distributed. In order to establish efficient information shar-\ning, many technical problems have to be solved. First, a suitable information source that might\ncontain data needed for a given task must be located. This problem of finding suitable in-\nformation sources is addressed in the areas of information retrieval and information filtering\n[Belkin and Croft 1992]. Once the information sources has been found, each of them have to\nwork together with the system that is querying the information, i.e., the access to the data in\nthe sources has to be provided. The problem of bringing together heterogeneous and distributed\ncomputer systems is known as interoperability problem.\n\nIn this chapter, we will present some results from the literature related with interoperabil-\nity and, more specifically, information integration. The revision considers some historical ap-\nproaches for data integration that are not notably evolving in recent years as well as the direction\nof research nowadays, mainly those based on ontology. Section 2.1 presents basic concepts re-\nlated with information systems interoperability. Section 2.2 analyzes the types of heterogeneity\nproblems that might arise due to heterogeneity of the data. Section 2.3 explains the process of\ninformation integration. Section 2.1 gives a retrospective of the several integration architectural\nsolutions that have been developed over the past decades. Section 2.5 presents a comprehensive\nview about the alternatives for applying ontologies for data integration. Finally, Section 2.6\npresents some works from literature that focus on the various techniques of semantic integra-\ntion, especially in petroleum domain.\n\n2.1 Information systems interoperability\n\nInformation interoperability is the capacity of different information systems, applications\nand services to communicate, share and interchange data, information and knowledge in an\neffective and precise way, as well as to integrate with other systems, applications and services\nin order to deliver new products and services [Fileto and Medeiros 2003].\n\nIn order to enable data exchanging and correct interpretation, two systems should have some\ndegree of compatibility. Ideally, cooperative systems should be compliant with computational\n\n\n\n22\n\nand application domain standards. However, this level of standardization may be impossible\nto attain in practice. The main reason is that while the real world is assumed to be unique, its\nrepresentation depends on the intended purpose. As a result, different applications that share\ninterest in the same real-world phenomena may have different perceptions and therefore require\ndifferent representations. Also, it is important to note that every representation of reality is user-\nspecific. This, combined with the rate of technology changes, the lack of universally accepted\nstandards, the existence of legacy systems, or just for reasons of autonomy of each information\nsystem, has made the process of achieve interoperability a very difficult task. As a result, in\nmany cases, the only way to reach interoperability is by publishing the interfaces, schemata and\nformats used for information exchange, making their semantics as explicit as possible. Thus,\nthe systems can be properly handled by the cooperative systems.\n\nAccording to Wache, in [Wache et al. 2001], interoperability has to be provided on a tech-\nnical and informational level, i.e., the sharing information needs to provide full accessibility to\nthe data and also requires that the accessed data may be processed and interpreted by the remote\nsystem. More specifically, Hasselbring, in [Hasselbring 2000], shows that information systems\u2019\ninteroperability must be considered from three viewpoints: application domain, conceptual de-\nsign and software systems technology. The structure of a set of information systems and their\ninteroperability in each one of these viewpoints are illustrated in Figure 2.1.\n\nFigure 2.1: The viewpoints of information systems interoperability\n[Fileto and Medeiros 2003].\n\nThe user\u2019s viewpoint concerns the distinct views and specializations of domain experts.\nThe designer\u2019s viewpoint refers to requirements modeling and system designs. The program-\nmer\u2019s viewpoint refers to systems implementation. Interoperability must be achieved in all these\n\n\n\n23\n\nviewpoints, i.e., users of a system must understand information coming from another system,\nthe system design must accommodate the \u201cforeign\u201d data, and the computer programs must au-\ntomate information exchange.\n\nThe distribution of information, however, is just one of the problems that must be faced.\nThe fact that the systems are often developed by different agencies with different points of\nview and vocabularies, leads to problems of heterogeneity. These problems should be found in\ncommunication processes between interoperable systems. In these cases, interoperability refers\nto various interactions between information from different sources, including the task of data\nintegration. Next section presents some problems that might arise due to heterogeneity of the\ndata.\n\n2.2 Types of heterogeneity conflicts\n\nThe concept of heterogeneous data is used for a long time to classify those data that present\ndifferences in their representation or interpretation, although referring to the same reality\n[Litwin and Abdellatif 1986]. Data heterogeneity conflicts are the incompa-tibilities that may\noccurs among distinct data sets. According to [Sheth and Larson 1990], the most widespread\nway to characterize data heterogeneity is to separate representation from interpretation con-\ncerns. Representational conflicts refer to syntactic or structural discrepancies in the portrayal of\nheterogeneous data. Semantic conflicts refer to disagreement about the meaning, interpretation\nor intended use of the same or related data.\n\nBoth representational and semantic conflicts may occurs in any level of abstraction (in-\nstance, schema and data model). Thus data heterogeneity conflicts can also be classified ac-\ncording to the following categories [H\u00e4rder, Sauter and Thomas 1999]:\n\n\u2022 Data conflicts, that are discrepancies in the representation or interpretation of instantiated\ndata values, which can differ in their measurement unit, precision and spelling;\n\n\u2022 Schema conflicts, that are differences in schemata due to alternatives to depict the same\nreality, such as using distinct names for the same entities or modeling attributes as entities\nand vice-versa;\n\n\u2022 Data versus schema conflicts, which are disagreements about what is data and metadata.\nFor example, a data value under one schema can be the label of an entity or attribute in\nanother schema;\n\n\u2022 Data model conflicts, which result from the use of different data models.\n\nThese heterogeneity problems and integration conflicts have been the subject of several tax-\nonomies, mainly within the distributed database systems community (e.g., [Kim and Seo 1991]\nand [Kashyap and Sheth 1996]). Among the three main conflict categories presented (syntac-\ntic, structural and semantic), we will focus on the semantic heterogeneity. In a broader view,\nsemantic conflicts are harder to disambiguate, since they occur whenever \u201ctwo contexts\u201d do not\n\n\n\n24\n\nuse the same interpretation of the information.\nA semantic heterogeneity can vary on account of the dimension of the representations\n\n[Benerecetti, Bouquet and Ghidini 2000] (Figure 2.2). When a representation covers a sub-\nset of a more comprehensive domain of interest, it is called as a partial representation, as\ndemonstrated in Figure 2.2a, where the small circles represent different portions of the same\ndomain of interest (the circle below). Each portion can overlap or be included in other por-\ntions. An approximate representation, on the other hand, corresponds to the case when the\nrepresentation abstracts some aspects of a given domain of interest. In Figure 2.2b, the circles\nabove are representations of the world at different levels of approximation (or granularity). Fi-\nnally, a perspectival representation corres-ponds to the case when the representation encodes\na spatio-temporal, logical, cognitive or functional point of view on a domain of interest (Figure\n2.2c).\n\n(a) Partiality (b) Approximation (c) Perspective\n\nFigure 2.2: Three dimensions of heterogeneity (adapted from\n[Benerecetti, Bouquet and Ghidini 2000]).\n\nIn order to achieve semantic interoperability in a heterogeneous information system, the\nmeaning of the information that is interchanged has to be understood across the systems. Taking\nthe contextual perspective into account, Goh et al., in [Goh et al. 1999], identifies three main\ncauses for semantic heterogeneity:\n\n\u2022 Confounding conflicts occur when information items seem to have the same meaning, but\ndiffer in reality, e.g. due to different temporal contexts;\n\n\u2022 Scaling conflicts occur when different reference systems are used to measure a value.\nExamples are different currencies;\n\n\u2022 Naming conflicts occur when naming schemata of information differ significantly. A\nfrequent phenomenon is the presence of homonyms and synonyms.\n\nMany authors stipulate that the use of ontologies for expressing the semantics of the sources\nis a possible approach to overcome the problem of semantic heterogeneity. Also, according to\n[Uschold and Gruninger 1996], that mention interoperability as a key application to ontologies,\n\n\n\n25\n\nmany ontology-based approaches to information integration have been developed in order to\nachieve interoperability. In this case, where ontologies are used to describe the heterogeneous\ndata sources, we are talking about ontology-based integration.\n\nIn this context, the problem of integrating different sources of information is shifted to in-\ntegrating different ontologies corresponding to these sources or domains. Thus, the main tasks\nof this integration process are: ontology merging, ontology mapping, and ontology integration\n[Klein 2001, Euzenat, Shvaiko et al. 2007]. The process of ontology merging creates a new on-\ntology from two or more existing ontologies with overlapping parts. The second task, ontology\nmapping, relates similar concepts or relations, according to some metrics, from different sources\nto each other by an equivalence relation. The mapping process results in a virtual integration.\nFinally, the process of ontology integration denotes the inclusion of one ontology into another\none by usually using bridge axioms.\n\nAll these tasks also have to face semantic heterogeneity problems, or in this case, onto-\nlogical heterogeneity [Visser et al. 1997]. This kind of heterogeneity occurs if two systems\nmake different ontological assumptions about their knowledge of the domain. According to\n[Chalupsky 2000, Visser et al. 1997, Wiederhold 1994], these mismatches between ontologies\ncan be divided into two main categories: language mismatches and ontology mismatches. Lan-\nguage mismatches occurs when ontologies written in different languages are combined. When\nthe mismatches are find in the same language through the use of abbreviations, acronyms, or\npunctuations, for instance, they are called linguistic mismatches\n[Madhavan, Bernstein and Rahm 2001]. Ontology mismatches occurs when ontologies describ-\ning overlapping domains are combined. This category describes different representations of a\nreal world domain. Therefore, it does not matter whether the language is the same or different,\nbut whether the concepts in the ontologies are different for a real world entity.\n\nVisser et al., in [Visser et al. 1997], also performed a classification where ontology mis-\nmatches are classified according to two sub-processes realized during the creation of an on-\ntology: conceptualizing a domain, and explicating the conceptualization. Conceptualization\nmismatches may appear when two or more conceptualizations differ in the ontological concepts\nor in the way these concepts are related. Explication mismatches, on the other hand, are not de-\nfined on the conceptualization of the domain but on the way the conceptualization is specified.\n\n2.3 The information integration process\n\nDifferently of what really means the information integration process for business, research\non information integration has focused individually on particular aspects of integration, such as\nschema mapping or replication. According to Haas, in [Haas 2006], for business, information\nintegration is really a process, with four major tasks: understanding, standardization, specifica-\ntion and execution.\n\nUnderstanding the data is the first task in information integration. It is during this task\n\n\n\n26\n\nthat relevant information may be discovered, such as keys, constraints, data types, and oth-\ners. The analysis of this information is important to assure quality and to determine statistical\nproperties (e.g., data distributions, frequent values, inconsistent values). The integrator may\nlook for relationships among data elements, such as foreign keys, or redundant columns. Also,\nfor unstructured data, the integrator may use metadata to understand the meaning of the data.\nBoth tools and end users leverage it to find and understand the data to be integrated. It is also\nproduced as the output of analysis, to be exploited by later tasks in the process.\n\nStandardization is the second task, which leverages the work of the previous task. Typically,\nit determines the best way to represent the integrated information. This includes designing\nthe integrated schema (know as \u201ctarget\u201d), deciding at the field level the rules on how data is\nrepresented, i.e., what the standard representation should be and even defining the terminology\nand abbreviations to use. In addition, other rules that specify how to cleanse or repair data may\nbe provided. These rules should help troubleshoot issues about how to handle inconsistent or\nincomplete data and how to identify data that refers to the same objects.\n\nThe third task, specification, produces the artifacts that will control the actual execution\nprocess. As a result, the techniques and technologies used in this task are related to the exe-\ncution engine(s) chosen. Mapping tools, for example, which specifies the relationship between\nsource(s) and target(s), can generate a query or other executable artifact (e.g., XSLT) that would\nproduce data in the desired target form. However, as the specification is usually part of actu-\nally configuring an integration engine to do the desired integration, determining the execution\nengine should be thought of as part of specification.\n\nFinally, the fourth task, execution, is where the integration actually happens. According to\n[Haas 2006], there are three ways in which integration can be accomplished: materialization;\nfederation; and/or indexing. Materialization creates and stores the integrated data set through\nvarious techniques, such as Extract/Transform/Load (ETL) tools, replication, and caching. The\nfirst technique extracts data from one or more data sources, transform them as indicated in the\nscript, and then store the result in another data source. The second one makes and maintains a\ncopy of data, often differentially by reading database log files. And the third technique captures\nquery results for future reuse. In the other hand, federation creates a virtual representation\nof the integrated set, only materializing selected portions as needed. Federation is a form of\nmediation, which refers to an integration technique in which requests are sent to a \u201cmediator\u201d\nprocess which does routing and translation of requests. The last way, indexing (or search),\ntakes a different approach, creating a single index over the data being integrated. Usually, this\napproach is used for unstructured data, and represents a partial materialization, since typically\nthe index identifies relevant documents, which will be fetched dynamically according the user\u2019s\nrequest.\n\nIt is important to note that all these four tasks, when implemented, are interdependent. Also,\nexisting tools often support several of these tasks (or at least part of them). In practice, these\ntasks may be overlapped, since it is not necessary to have a complete understanding before\n\n\n\n27\n\nstarting to standardize. Likewise, a particular integration may not require all of the subtasks\nfor any task. Especially in really simple cases, some tasks may seem to vanish altogether.\nTherefore, the integration process is iterative and never-ending, since changes are constant.\nThere is always another source to deal with, a new application with new requirements, an update\nto some schema, or just new data that requires analysis.\n\n2.4 System-based information integration\n\nEven after decades of research, integrating information remains an omnipresent and ex-\ntremely expensive challenge. Large enterprises spend a great deal of time and money on in-\nformation integration. In the expenses are included the software purchases and also integration\nactivities, that cover any form of information reuse, such as moving data from one application\u2019s\ndatabase to another, translating messages for business-to-business e-commerce, and providing\naccess to structured data and documents via a Web portal. In relation to software, they are\nbecoming increasingly frequent, making the process of information integration much easier\n[Bernstein and Haas 2008].\n\nThere are many architectural approaches that can be used to solve problems related to in-\nformation integration. Also, many software vendors have offered numerous tools to reduce the\neffort and the cost of integration and to improve its quality. Moreover, due to the complexity\nof the process of information integration, and also its multifaceted task, many of these tools are\nhighly specialized. As a result, finding the most suitable tool for a particular integration problem\nrequires a general understanding of the available tools, which can be confusing. Consequently,\nchoosing the most appropriate tool is becoming increasingly more challenging. Furthermore, if\nthe choice is not suitable, instead to facilitate, the chosen tool may increase the time required to\nprovide information integration for a new application [Haas 2006].\n\nIn this Section, we will summarize some integration approaches, along with the general\ntypes of products used. Our main goal is to provide a brief explanation of the main features\nand uses of each integration approach more used by software vendors. Thereby, assisting the\nprofessionals involved in the integration process to choose the most appropriate tool for your\nneeds.\n\n2.4.1 Data warehouse\n\nA Data Warehouse (DW), by definition, is a database that consolidates data from multiple\nsources [Chaudhuri and Dayal 1997]. A DW system stores copies of data from various sources.\nMoreover, these data could be updated regularly. As a result, these data could be overlapping\nand may have inconsistent information, requiring a previous data cleaning to reconcile such\ndifferences in a DW. Furthermore, each data source integrated by the DW may have a database\nschema (that is, data representation) that differs from the warehouse schema. Thus, each data\n\n\n\n28\n\nsource must be reshaped into the common warehouse schema.\nThe use of ETL tools, that address this problem [Kimball and Caserta 2004], is helping by\n\nsimplifying the programming of scripts to transform the data to suit the warehouse schema. An\nETL tool typically includes a repertoire of cleansing operations (such as detection of approx-\nimate duplicates) and reshaping operations (such as Structured Query Language [SQL]-style\noperations to select, join, and sort data). The tool may also include scheduling functions to\ncontrol periodic loading or refreshing of the data warehouse.\n\nSome applications require customized ETL tools to produce a DW that holds the master\ncopy of critical enterprise reference data, such as information about customers or products.\nIn this case, we are talking about customized ETL tools for master data management, where\nthe mater data is first integrated from multiple sources and then itself becomes the definitive\nsource of that data for the enterprise. Sometimes, theses master data-management tools include\ndomain-specific functionality, like standardization and cleansing functions to validate and cor-\nrect customer or vendor information (e.g., postal codes based in the address).\n\nA DW system significant differs of a database system, especially in relation to data process-\ning. A database system uses an online transaction processing, or OLTP, which is application\noriented, has its emphasis on efficiency through a fast and secure processing, and its operations\ndo not alter the structure of the data. On the other hand, a DW system uses an online analytical\nprocessing, or OLAP, which is a decision-making oriented process, has it emphasis in analyti-\ncal flexibility, and its operations alter the structure of the data. OLAP is the DW basic activity.\nIt does not help having a well-defined DW unless we have analytical tools that allow queries to\ndecision-making purposes. The Figure 2.3 illustrates the uses of the tools explained.\n\nFigure 2.3: Data Warehouse related tools and systems.\n\n2.4.2 Virtual data integration\n\nDifferently of a warehouse integration, which materializes the integrated data, a Virtual\nData Integration gives the illusion that data sources have been integrated without material-\nizing the integrated view. A virtual data integration system offers to the users a mediated\n\n\n\n29\n\nschema, where they can perform queries. The implementation is often called a query mediator\n[Wiederhold 1992] or an enterprise-information integration (EII) system [Halevy et al. 2005,\nMorgenthal and Kernochan 2005]. It translates the user\u2019s queries on the data sources and in-\ntegrates the result of those queries so that it appears to have come from a single integrated\ndatabase. This technology is more recent and currently less popular than data warehousing.\n\nAn EII system might be use to integrate data from heterogeneous databases that cover related\nsubject matter, but that may use different database systems and structure the data using different\nschemata. To handle with this heterogeneity in an EII system, a designer needs to create a\nmediated schema that covers the desired subject matter in the data sources and maps the data\nsource schemata to the new mediated schema. However, data cleansing and reshaping problems\nalso appear in the EII context, but the solutions are different in EII systems because data must\nbe transformed as part of query processing rather than via the periodic batch process associated\nwith loading a data warehouse.\n\nAs described in [Bernstein and Haas 2008], depending on the types of data sources to be\nintegrated, EII products vary. Some products, for example, focus on integrating SQL databases,\nsome on integrating Web services, and some on integrating bioinformatics databases.\n\n2.4.3 Message mapping\n\nIn order to integrate applications developed independently, a special software can be re-\nquired, i.e., a computer software that provides services to software applications beyond those\navailable from the operating system (a middleware). Middleware makes it easier for software\ndevelopers to perform communication and input/output, so they can focus on the specific pur-\npose of their application. Specifically, a message-oriented middleware helps integrate indepen-\ndently developed applications by moving messages between them.\n\nThe resulting product can be of three types: an enterprise-application integration (EAI)\nsystem [Alonso et al. 2004]; an enterprise service bus, and a workflow system. The first is when\nthe messages pass through a broker. The second is when the broker is avoided through all\napplication\u2019s use of the same protocol, such Web services. And the third is when the focus is on\ndefining and controlling the order in which each application is invoked (as part of a multistep\nservice). Another form of information integration, a message-translation service, is also needed\nbeyond the protocol-translation and flow-control services provided by these products.\n\nUsually, a message-mapping tool is used to translate messages from one application to an-\nother. Such a tool offers a graphical interface to define translation functions, which are then\ncompiled into a program to perform the message translation. Similar mapping tools are used to\nhelp relate the schemata of the source databases to the target schema for ETL and EII and to\ngenerate the programs needed for data translation.\n\n\n\n30\n\n2.4.4 Object-to-relational mappers\n\nThe majority of application programs today are written in an object-oriented language, but\nthe data accessed by them is usually stored in a relational database. There are many approaches\nfor mapping applications to databases that requires integration of the relational and application\nschemata. In all these approaches, differences in schema constructs can make the mapping even\nmore complicated.\n\nIn order to simplify this problem, an Object-to-Relational Mapper can be used to offer\na high-level language in which to define mappings [Melnik, Adya and Bernstein 2007]. The\nresulting mappings can be compiled into programs that will translate the queries and updated\nover the object-oriented interface into queries and updates on the relational databases.\n\n2.4.5 Document management\n\nThe vast majority of companies have to deal daily with a large amount of information. This\ninformation, usually, is relevant to critical business functions (e.g., product designs, marketing\nplans, pricing, and development schedules). Furthermore, to promote collaboration and avoid\nduplicated work in a large organization, this information needs to be integrated and published.\nHowever, much of this information is contained in documents, such as text files, spreadsheets,\nand slide shows that contain interrelated information. In this case of integration, we are talk-\ning about a Document Management approach, that may simply involve making the documents\navailable on a single Web page (such as a portal, that will be presented in Section 2.4.6) or in\na content-management system, possibly augmented with per-document annotations, i.e., with\ndocument\u2019s metadata (author and status, for example). This integration process also may mean\nthe combination of the information from these documents into a new document, such as a fi-\nnancial analysis.\n\nUsing a document management approach, whether or not they are collected in one store,\nthey can be indexed to enable keyword search across the enterprise. It could be useful, in some\napplications, to extract structured information from documents, such as customer name and\naddress from email messages received by the customer-support team. This ability of extract-\ning structured information may also allow business to integrate unstructured documents with\npreexisting structured data.\n\n2.4.6 Portal management\n\nA Portal is a Web site built to integrate related information by presenting them side-by-side,\ni.e., on the same screen. For example, the home page of a financial service Web site typically\npresents market prices, business news, and analyses of recent trends. The person viewing it\ndoes the actual integration of the information.\n\n\n\n31\n\nThe design of a portal requires a mixture of content management and user-interaction tech-\nnology. The first one allows the users of the portal to deal with documents and databases. The\nsecond is important to present the information to the users in a useful and attractive ways. These\ntechnologies could be packaged together into a product for portal design [Firestone 2003].\nHowever, usually they are selected separately, based on the required functionality of the portal\nand the preferences and experience of the developers who assemble it.\n\n2.5 Ontology-based integration approaches\n\nTraditionally, ontologies are applied in information integration as a supportive resource for\nsome specific aspects of semantic integration such as schema matching. In contrast, in the\nconcept of ontology-based integration, ontologies are utilized to overcome different types of\nsemantic heterogeneity on data and schema level, as explained previously.\n\nThere are, however, different ways of how ontologies can be employed. Wache et al., in\n[Wache et al. 2001], provides an overview of the three different conceptual design alternatives\nfor applying ontologies for data integration: single ontology approach, multiple ontology ap-\nproach, and hybrid ontology approach (as presented in Figure 2.4).\n\nUsually, ontology-based integration is a top-down process, on which, first, a context-specific\nontology is designed, which take the role of a global schema, to then relate (i.e., map) the\nheterogeneous datasets to this global ontology. The application of subsumption or inference\nalgorithms can then discover further semantic relationships between the data from the different\nsystems. This single ontology approach, represented in Figure 2.4a, has as main advantage\nthe quick development. However, its common problem is the request of managing a global\nintegrated ontology, which involves administration, maintenance, consistency and efficiency\nproblems that are very hard to solve.\n\nAlternatively, the local datasets can be mapped to their own local ontologies, which are then\nharmonized in a further ontology alignment step. Using this multiple ontologies approach, rep-\nresented in Figure 2.4b, the addition of a new source will be easier than in the single approach,\nsince it demands the built of only one ontology. However, in practice, it is difficult to compare\ndifferent source ontologies without a common vocabulary, and inter-ontology mappings need to\nbe defined.\n\nA hybrid ontology approach, represented in Figure 2.4c, would combine the use of local\nontologies and a global ontology. This approach was developed to overcome the drawbacks of\nthe other approaches. In the hybrid approach, each information source is described by its own\nontology, which in turn is built using basic primitives described in a global shared vocabulary.\nWhen the ontologies need to be developed from scratch, this approach brings advantages. How-\never, the shared vocabulary can be a problem if it increases rapidly. Also, the reuse of existing\nontologies can be a problem in this approach, since they need to be rewritten to refer to the\nshared vocabulary.\n\n\n\n32\n\n(a) Single ontology approach (b) Multiple ontology approach\n\n(c) Hybrid ontology approach\n\nFigure 2.4: Three ways for connecting ontologies to information sources (adapted from\n[Wache et al. 2001]).\n\nBased on this hybrid approach, two new approaches for specifying mappings in an integrated\nsystem have emerged [Calvanese, Giacomo and Lenzerini 2002, Calvanese and Giacomo 2005]:\nglobal-as-view (GAV), and local-as-view (LAV) (Figure 2.5). The GAV approach is based on\nthe definition of global concepts as views over the sources, i.e., each concept of the global view\nis mapped to a query over the sources. Figure 2.5a presents how the mappings are defined over\nthe sources (S1-S3) giving a global ontology (G). The LAV approach is based on the defini-\ntion of the sources as views over the global view, i.e., the source\u2019s information is described\nin terms of this global view, as presented in Figure 2.5b. According to advantages and disad-\nvantages of each approach, that have to be considered when an integration process is initiated\n[Cal\u00ec et al. 2003], both approaches have their ups and downs. With respect to restrictions over\nthe sources, the LAS approach takes advantage, but in the GAV approach it is easier to define\nrestrictions over the global view. With respect to scalability, the LAV approach allows that a\nnew source is added in the integrated system without requiring changes in the global as view,\nwhereas the GAV approach requires changes over the global view when a new source is added.\nConsidering query processing, LAV may demand reasoning mechanisms in order to answer\nthem, whereas in GAV conventional mechanisms can be implemented.\n\n\n\n33\n\n(a) Global-as-view approach (b) Local-as-view approach\n\nFigure 2.5: GAV and LAV approaches [Buccella, Cechich and Fillottrani 2009].\n\nIn order to take advantage of both approaches, a new approach has emerged\n[Friedman et al. 1999, Fagin et al. 2005]: global-local-as-view (GLAV). This approach can be\nconsidered as a generalization of both GAV and LAV [Cal\u00ec 2003] and consists of association\nviews over the global schema to views over the sources, i.e. mappings can be specified in both\ndirections.\n\n2.6 Related work in semantic integration in petroleum domain\n\nThere are many works in the literature that focus on the various techniques of semantic\nintegration. Among them, we can highlight the reviews of database schema matching ap-\nproaches developed by [Rahm and Bernstein 2001] and [Doan and Halevy 2005]; the surveys\nof ontology-based approaches for information integration developed by [Wache et al. 2001] and\n[Noy 2004]; and the work carried on by [Kalfoglou and Schorlemmer 2003] that focus on the\ncurrent state of the art in ontology matching.\n\nBesides these works, Gagnon, in [Gagnon 2007], proposes an ontology-based information\nintegration with a local to global ontology mapping as an approach to the integration of hetero-\ngeneous data sources.\n\nSoma, in [Soma et al. 2008], proposes the use of ontologies or the information schemata that\nmodel various elements from the domain, and a knowledge base, which is a central repository of\nthe instance information, to address problems commonly encountered in model based oil field\noperations (as explained in Chapter 1). This work is part of the Integrated Asset Management\n(IAM) project at the Chevron-funded Center for Interactive Smart Oilfield Technologies at the\nUniversity of Southern California, Los Angeles1. The current focus of the IAM project is on\nenabling model-driven reservoir management.\n\nMastella, in [Mastella 2010], describes an architecture for ontology-based integration of\nengineering models. Her approach, using a hybrid structure of local and global ontologies, uses\nannotations to connect the local data sources representations (local views) to their ontological\n\n1Cisoft IAM Project, http://pgroup.usc.edu/wiki/Smart_Oilfield\n\n\n\n34\n\nmeaning (local ontologies). The mapping between the global and the local ontologies are called\nlocal-to-global alignments.\n\nCalvanese, in [Calvanese et al. 2007] describes Mastro-I, a data integration management\nsystem designed in order to maintain data complexity within reasonable bounds. It relies on\nthe IBM product Infosphere Federation Server 3 to access source databases. In other work\n[Calvanese et al. 2011], the same group describes a database integration case using Mastro-I,\nin which five different data models were used, including XML-based and relational databases.\nThe integration was made in two steps: first the different data models were combined using\nthe InfoSphere Federation Server; then the Mastro-I system was used to map those entities into\nconcepts, thus achieving data integration. In this architecture, there are two layers of hetero-\ngeneity solving: first, all relational data is mapped at the Federation Server, and then mapped\ninto DL concepts, where integration is actually achieved.\n\nGe, in [Ge et al. 2011], presents a system framework for ontology-based knowledge integra-\ntion and sharing in petroleum exploration domain conceived to minimize the complexity of het-\nerogeneous data, and enhances power of knowledge integration and information sharing among\ndifferent operational units. They designed a framework divided into two parts: ontology-based\nknowledge integration, which includes ontology mapping and ontology merging, and ontology-\nbased knowledge sharing that includes concept searching and concept selecting. The concept\nsearching consists of concept matching and purpose identification, and concept selecting con-\nsists of concept expansion and knowledge selection.\n\nBuccella et al., in [Buccella, Cechich and Fillottrani 2009], presents a survey of the current\napproaches of ontology-driven geographic information integration. In other work\n[Buccella et al. 2011], the same group proposes a novel system (called GeoMergeP) to inte-\ngrate geographic sources by formalizing their information as normalized ontologies. Their in-\ntegral merging process \u2014 including structural, syntactic and semantic aspects \u2014 assists users\nin finding the more suitable correspondences.\n\n\n\n35\n\n3 CONCEPTUAL MODELING AND ONTOLOGIES\n\nConceptual modeling is concerned with identifying, analyzing and describing the concepts\nof a domain, as well as their semantic relationships. This is done with the help of a modeling\nlanguage that is based on a small set of basic meta-concepts (forming a metamodel). On the\nother hand, ontological modeling is concerned with capturing the relevant entities of a domain\nin an ontology of that domain using an ontology specification language that is based on a set of\ndomain-independent ontological categories (forming an upper level ontology)\n[Guizzardi et al. 2004].\n\nIn reservoir analysis, the modeling process is carried out by the geologist, who tries to cap-\nture and represent parts of the geological reality of the subsurface. In order to cope with this\ntask, the geologist creates mental models of his comprehension of the subsurface geology. A\nmental model abstracts the relevant aspects of the objects, omitting those considered irrelevant\nfor the task in hands. The conceptualization represented in an earth model is an abstract entity\nthat only exists in the geologist\u2019s mind. Consequently, what is finally represented in the model\nis the geologist\u2019s idea about the reality and not the reality itself. In order for a model to be\nunderstood by a community of professionals along with the modeling chain, the set of con-\ncepts in the geologist\u2019s mind and the corresponding external representation need to share the\nsame respective meanings accepted by the community. These shared concepts and the agreed\nrepresentations are what we call an ontology.\n\nThe term \u201contology\u201d has its origin in philosophy, where it is understood as a particular sys-\ntem of categories accounting for a certain vision of the world. As such, this system is indepen-\ndent of the language used to describe it [Guarino 1998]. In the context of Computer Science,\nthe term ontology usually designates an artifact that refers to some shared conceptualization\nand to its external representation in a computer processing language [Gruber 1992]. However,\nNicholas Guarino [Guarino 1998] reinforces that an ontology is a logical theory accounting for\nthe intended meaning of a formal vocabulary utilized for representation. Indeed, ontology is\nthe theory that helps us in keeping the correspondence between the geological reality and the\nmodels produced from this reality.\n\nGruber, in [Gruber 2008], tells that the AI community came to use the term ontology in the\n1980\u2019s to refer to both a theory of a modeled world and a component of knowledge systems.\nAnd then, in the early 1990\u2019s, ontologies were identified as a key component for creating inter-\noperability standards. At that moment, a globally accepted definition of an ontology in computer\nscience was offered by [Studer, Benjamins and Fensel 1998], which states that an ontology is a\nformal explicit specification of a shared conceptualization.\n\n\n\n36\n\n3.1 Foundational ontologies\n\nFoundational ontologies are meta-models that orient the way in which some conceptualiza-\ntion should be identified and modeled in a formal representation to build an artifact represent-\ning the domain ontology. Domain ontologies refer to the concepts and meanings that a group\nof people needs to share when they communicate for solving problems in some restricted do-\nmain. The object of foundational ontologies is the study of universals, which are the intended\nmeaning or the abstraction of the main properties that characterize a set of individuals recog-\nnized in the real world. Universals are equivalent to classes or objects in modeling languages,\nwhile individuals are their instances. Ontological analysis also provides an important distinc-\ntion among the entities in terms of their behavior with refers to time: endurants and perdurants.\nEndurants correspond to individuals wholly present whenever they are present, i.e., they are in\ntime (e.g., rock, reservoir and petroleum). Perdurants correspond to individuals composed of\ntemporal parts, they happen in time in the sense that they extend in time accumulating temporal\nparts (e.g., deposition, oil migration or earthquake). Endurants have a relation of participation\nin perdurant occurrences, and these are commonly responsible for the creation of those. Also,\nfoundational ontologies deal with ontological properties drawn from Philosophy (e.g., identity,\ndependence, unity), i.e., with formal aspects of universal and individuals irrespective of their\nparticular nature. The properties applied in this work are essentiality, rigidity, identity, and unity\nas proposed by Guarino in [Guarino and Welty 2009].\n\nA property of an entity is essential to that entity if it must hold for it. It is a definitional\nproperty that explains what causes an individual be an instance of a specific universal. For\nexample, it is essential for a mineral being solid and having a crystalline structure at a normal\ntemperature. Some essential properties are rigid, meaning that they are essential to all their\npossible instances. If a mineral ceases of being solid, for instance, it will stop being a mineral,\nsince being solid is a rigid property for a mineral that helps in identifying and defining it. Some\nproperties are anti-rigid. For example, a reservoir can stop being considered a reservoir because\nit was fully depleted or became non-economic, but the concrete entity that was before a reservoir\n(the rock unit) is still there. Rigid properties are important because they identify the objects that\nare present in all geological models and can be mapped from one model to another.\n\nIdentity refers to the issue of being able to recognize individual entities in the world as be-\ning the same (or different), and unity refers to the issue of being able to recognize all the parts\nthat form an individual entity. Both ontological properties are crucial for geological interpre-\ntation and are used by geologists to interpret stratigraphic and structural correlations. Identity\ninvolves, for instance, the rigid properties of a rock unit that need to be considered for deciding,\nwhether a body of rock corresponds or not to some geological unit although these two entities\nwere possibly described in two different places (a wellbore and an outcrop, for example). Unity\nrefers to the problem of describing the parts and boundaries of an object, so that we can decide\nwhat is part of the object, what is not, and under what conditions the object is a whole. For\n\n\n\n37\n\nexample, water is a concept whose instances were not wholes, except if they are limited by an\ninstance of some other object, such as a cup, a bottle or a lake. In the same sense, rocks have\nno unity, since a rock can only be individualized by a core, a sample or a geological unit.\n\n3.1.1 Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO)\n\nGuizzardi, in [Guizzardi 2005], states that foundational ontologies, also called upper level\nontologies, are meta-ontologies that describe a set of ontological categories of high-level ab-\nstraction, domain independent, and constitute a general grounding for multiple ontologies more\nelaborate and specific to particular domains. In this sense, foundational ontologies can be used\nto describe the categories used to build conceptual models of lower level, such as domain-\nspecific ontologies, making them a suitable reference for the development of languages. Thus,\nfoundational ontologies act as guides for modeling decision making in a conceptual modeling\nprocess, explaining and justifying the meaning of the models, increasing the understandability\nand reusability of their potential [Guizzardi 2005].\n\nAmong the available foundational ontologies highlights the UFO (Unified Foundational On-\ntology), who proposed the unification of concepts addressed by other foundational ontologies,\nsuch as OntoClean/DOLCE and GFO/GOL, in order to offer solutions to unsolved problems in\nthese other ontologies [Guizzardi and Wagner 2010]. According to\n[Guizzardi, Falbo and Guizzardi 2008], UFO has been applied successfully to evaluate,\nre-design and integration of models of conceptual modeling languages and also to provide real-\nworld semantics to their modeling constructs.\n\nFigure 3.1 presents the initial distinctions of UFO, starting with its most generic concept,\nThing, and its distinction between two fundamental entities: Urelement and Set. A Urelement,\nwhich is an entity that is not a set, is divided between the categories of individuals and univer-\nsals. Individuals, also called Particulars, are entities that exist in reality, as a person, a table,\netc. On the other hand, Universals are standard features instantiable by different individuals,\nso that they can be understood as high-level abstractions that characterize different classes of\nindividuals. In this sense, Person is a universal that describes the common characteristics of the\ndifferent individuals (particular persons) of this type, for instance, name and fingerprint.\n\nAs previously mentioned, UFO universals are specialize in Endurant Universal and Perdu-\nrant Universal. This distinction can be understood in terms of the behavior of their individuals\nwith refers to time. Endurant Universals are those whose individuals are wholly present when-\never they are present, i.e., individuals that preserve their identity over the passage of time. Per-\ndurant Universals are those whose individuals are composed of temporal parts. The first part,\nrelated to Endurant Universals, corresponds to the core fragment of UFO, called UFO-A and\ndescribed in [Guizzardi 2005]. The second part, related to Perdurant Universals, corresponds\nto the UFO fragment called UFO-B, which increases the scope of the UFO-A systematizing\nconcepts and temporal relationships between objects and events. UFO-B was first described\n\n\n\n38\n\nFigure 3.1: UFO fragment that represents the fundamental distinctions between urelement and\nset, and universal and individual [Guizzardi 2005].\n\nin [Guizzardi, Falbo and Guizzardi 2008] and recently formalized in [Guizzardi et al. 2013]. A\nthird part of UFO is called UFO-C, which was developed over UFO-A and UFO-B and con-\nstitutes an ontology of social notions and intentional agents. The UFO-C was described in\n[Guizzardi et al. 2007], [Guizzardi and Guizzardi 2011] and [Souza 2006]. In this work, we\nemphasize the concepts of UFO-A and UFO-B .\n\nFigure 3.2 presents the main distinctions between Endurant Universals, which are divided\ninto two categories: Substantial Universals and Moment Universals. Substantial Universals are\nuniversals whose individuals are existentially independent, have spatio-temporal properties and\nare founded in matter (e.g., a rock). Moment Universals are universals whose individuals are ex-\nistentially dependent, so that they can only exist in other individuals and that, therefore, are said\ninherent in these individuals (for example, a deposition). According to UFO, the relationship\nbetween a Substance Universal and a Moment Universal is called participation.\n\nMoreover, moment universals are divided into Intrinsic Moments and Relators. Intrinsic\nmoments represent individuals that depend on just one individual. For example, the intrinsic\nmoment Color, where each of its individuals depend uniquely to a single individual (e.g., the\ncolor of an apple). On the other hand, relators represent individuals that depend on many\nindividuals (e.g., a job, which involves an employer and an employee) and materialize the notion\nof material relation in conceptual models.\n\nRelations, which are entities that glue together other entities, are divided into two categories:\nformal relations and material relations. Formal relations occur directly between two or more\nentities directly, i.e., do not require the intervention of another individual. Formal relations\ninclude relations of the UFO\u2019s mathematics superstructure, such as existential dependence, part\nof, subset of, instantiation, etc., and the relations of comparison, established in the domain,\nsuch as greater than, older than, among others. Formal relations of comparison are completely\nfounded in intrinsic moments being compared. Moreover, the material relations have their own\n\n\n\n39\n\nFigure 3.2: UFO fragment that represents the distinctions between endurant and perdurant\nuniversals and individuals and between substantial and moment universals and individuals\n[Guizzardi 2005].\n\nstructure material. For example, the relations work at, be enrolled in, etc. In this case, to make a\nmaterial relation to happen, such as the relation be treated in between John and a medical unit,\nthere must be another entity, called treatment, to mediate John and medical unit. Those entities\nthat mediate other individuals are called relational moments.\n\nSome Intrinsic Moments Universals are Quality Universals, which represent properties in\nconceptual models. A quality universal characterize other universals and is related to Quality\nStructure, which represent a set of all values that a quality can assume. A quality structure can\nbe a Quality Domain or a Quality Dimension, such that a quality domain can be composed of\nvarious quality dimensions. Thus, the property Weight, for example, is associated with a one-\ndimensional structure comprising the non-negative part of the real numbers line, so that this\nquality structure constitutes a quality dimension. On the other hand, the universal Color is as-\nsociated with a multidimensional structure, which includes brightness, contrast and saturation,\nso that this structure is a quality domain. The perception or conception of a moment can be\nrepresented as a point in a quality structure. This point is called quale. The entities comprising\nQuality Structure and Quale are, along with sets, numbers and propositions, examples of Ab-\nstract Particulars. Intrinsic Moments Universals that are not associated with quality structures\nare called Modes. Modes represent individuals who are existentially depend of another indi-\nvidual, but can be conceptualized in terms of multiple quality dimensions separable, as occurs\n\n\n\n40\n\nwith substantial individuals. Thus, modes may have other intrinsic moments inherent in them\n(e.g., symptoms, desires, thoughts and skills). Figure 3.3 summarizes the relationship between\na substantial, one of its qualities and the associated quale.\n\nFigure 3.3: Representation of the relationship between substance universals, quality universals\nand quality dimensions. In this figure, i represents a inherence relation, in the sense that the\nquality individual w is inherent to the substance individual a. While ql represents the relation\nbetween the quality individual w and the quale q, which represents its value, in the quality\ndimension [Guizzardi 2005].\n\nSubstantial Universals are divided into two main specializations: Sortal Universals and\nMixin Universals. Sortal Universals are Substantial Universals that provide a principle of iden-\ntity (PI), which allows us to tell when two instances of a Universal are the same (as a puppy and\nthe same adult dog), and a principle of unity (PU), which allows us to identify all the parts that\nmake up an entire object, supporting the individualization of individuals of a universal. In this\ncontext, the concept Rock, for example, provides a PI, but only a sample of a rock provides a PI\nand PU, since it is not possible to count a rock or define its beginning and end. Mixin Univer-\nsals, in its turn, are defined by UFO as dispersive universals that generalize various universals\nwith different identity principles.\n\nUsing as a criterion the rigidity property, UFO establishes two types of Universals: Rigid\nSortal Universals and Anti-Rigid Sortal universals. A rigid sortal universal is the one where\nits individuals are the same in all possible worlds (in the modal sense), i.e., its individuals do\nnot cease to be them without ceasing to exist. For example, a Person is a rigid sortal because\nonly ceases to be a Person when ceasing to exist. On the other hand, anti-rigid sortal universals\nare those that are not needed for any of the individuals. For example, a Student is an anti-rigid\nsortal because a person can no longer be a Student and still exist.\n\nAs presented in Figure 3.4, UFO provides three fundamental types of rigid sortal universals:\nKind, Collective and Quantity. Kinds represent universal whose individuals are functional com-\n\n\n\n41\n\nplexes, such as Person, Car, etc. Collectives represent universal whose instances are collections\nof functional complexes that have a uniform structure, such as Forest, Deck, etc. Quantities\nrefer to maximally self-connected portions of matters, such as Rock, Wood, Water, etc. Subkind\nare rigid sortals that carry the identity criterion for its instances, offered by Substantial Univer-\nsals and inherited in the hierarchy. For example, Man and Woman are subtypes of the universal\nPerson.\n\nAmong the anti-rigid sortal universals, UFO provides two types of universals: Roles and\nPhases. Roles are relationally dependent universals, i.e., an individual performs a Role when it\nis related to a foreign entity or when participating in events. For example, a person performs a\nRole of student when related to an educational institution. Phases are relationally independent\nuniversals that define different stages of a universal. Phases define disjoint partitions of a set,\nso that one individual may be in only one of these phases in a given world. The individual\nof a certain universal can go through various stages throughout their existence because of the\noccurrence of intrinsic changes without losing its identity. For example, Child, Adolescent and\nAdult are different phases of Person.\n\nFigure 3.4: Representation of the taxonomy of UFO\u2019s substantial universals\n[Guizzardi 2005].\n\nThe Mixin Universals, also presented in Figure 3.4, may be understood as generalizations\nof distinct sortal universals, so that they are distinguished according to their rigidity. UFO dis-\ntinguishes them in three types: Category, Role Mixin and Mixin. The Categories are universals\nthat abstract an essential feature of many disjoint universals\u2019 individuals, being itself a rigid\nUniversal. For example, a Relational Entity, which abstracts an essential feature shared by Per-\n\n\n\n42\n\nson and Artificial Agent. Role Mixins are universals that abstract features that are accidental\nto individuals of various disjoint types, with different identity criteria. Thus, they can be un-\nderstood as generalizations of multiple distinct roles. For example, Customer is a role mixin,\nwhich generalizes Personal Client (played by Person) and Corporate Client (played by Organi-\nzation). Mixin are universal that abstract features that are essential to some of its instances, but\naccidental for others. An example of a mixin is Seatable Object that abstracts properties that\nare essential for Chair and Bench, but accidental to Table.\n\nFinally, UFO proposes four types of parthood relations with different semantics, based on\nthe types of entities that they relate: componentOf, memberOf, subCollectionOf, and subQuan-\ntityOf. Each parthood relation can be established only between individuals of specific UFO\nmetatypes, which respect certain ontological constraints embodied in the UFO.\n[Guizzardi 2005] defines these relationships as follows:\n\n\u2022 ComponentOf is the relation between a component and a functional complex, where the\ncomponent preserves its individuality. For example, an engine is a ComponentOf a car,\nand a mineral is a ComponentOf a rock.\n\n\u2022 SubQuantityOf describes the relation of constitution, in which a component is some\namount of matter that cannot be individualized. For example, potassium is a SubQuanti-\ntyOf feldspar, alcohol is a SubQuantityOf wine.\n\n\u2022 SubCollectionOf describes the relation between two collections, a division of a collection,\nand the collection itself. For example, the northern part of the forest is a SubCollectionOf\na forest, and the set of deposits produced by the transgressive cycle is a SubCollectionOf\na stratigraphic sequence.\n\n\u2022 MemberOf describes the relation of some individual to a collection of individuals. As\nan example, a tree is a MemberOf a forest, and a depositional unit is a MemberOf a\nstratigraphic sequence.\n\nRegarding UFO-B is an ontology of particulars whose fundamental concept is Event Uni-\nversal, which constitutes possible transformations of one situation of reality to another, i.e.,\nevents can change the state of affairs of a state (pre-state) to other (post-state). A Situation, in\nthis sense, is an Endurant Universal that represents the state of affairs. Events can be of two\ntypes: Atomic Event or Complex Event. Atomic events are those that can not be decomposed\ninto other events, such as an explosion. Complex events are composed of other events, such\nas a football match and a war. Events are ontologically dependent entities, since they depend\non participants to occur. For example, considering the event e: the attack of Caesar by Brutus\n[Guizzardi 2005]. In this event there are the participation of Caesar, Brutus and the knife used\nin the attack. So, e is composed of the individual participation of each of these entities. Each\nparticipation is existentially dependent on a single substantial and may be itself an Atomic\nEvent or a Complex Event.\n\n\n\n43\n\n4 PETROLEUM SYSTEM AND RESERVOIR MODELING\n\nThe oil and gas industry can be divided into three major sectors: upstream, midstream\nand downstream. The first one, which is also commonly known as the exploration and pro-\nduction (E&amp;P) sector, finds and produces crude oil and natural gas. The midstream industry\nprocesses, stores, markets and transports commodities such as crude or refined petroleum prod-\nucts. Pipelines and other transport systems can be used to move crude oil from production sites\nto refineries and deliver the various refined products to downstream distributors. Finally, the\ndownstream industry refers to the refining of petroleum crude oil and the processing and pu-\nrifying of raw natural gas, as well as the marketing and distribution of products derived from\ncrude oil and natural gas. The downstream sector provides to final consumers thousands of\nproducts such as gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, diesel oil, heating oil, fuel oils, lubricants, waxes,\nasphalt, natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as well as hundreds of petrochemicals\n[Feijo 2010].\n\nThe E&amp;P sector involves activities in which acquisition, distribution and use of expert\nknowledge are more critical for the decision-making. In order to overcome this problem, the\npetroleum industry depends on derived interpretations, developed scenarios and taken decisions\nfrom a massive volume of data generated on computer models related to several process. Among\nthese process, we can mention 3D seismic interpretation, well bore drilling, reservoir modeling\nand monitoring and also plant/facility modeling or monitoring capabilities.\n\nIn this chapter, we will present more details about the earth modeling activity for petroleum\nexploration. The operations related with this activity generated the core data analyzed in this\nwork. However, before going into details about the earth modeling process and its activities,\nwe will present an overview of the basic concepts related with the petroleum formation and the\ndata derived from the E&amp;P activities. The comprehension of these concepts is important for\na better understanding of the data used in our approach. Thus, Section 4.1 presents the basic\nconcepts related with generation, migration and accumulation of petroleum. Then, Section\n4.2 presents more details about the data derived from E&amp;P activities available for reservoir\nmodeling. Finally, Section 4.3 presents an overview of the earth modeling activity for petroleum\nexploration.\n\n4.1 Basic concepts\n\nAs previously mentioned, the main concern of all oil companies is to find commercial hy-\ndrocarbons deposits that are present in the subsurface as solids (solid products contained in\noil shales), liquids (oil), or gas (natural gas). Both crude oil and natural gas are mixtures of\nmolecules formed by carbon and hydrogen atoms. Among the different types of crude oil and\nnatural gases, some are more valuable than others. Heavy crude oils, for instance, are very think\nand viscous, making it very difficult or impossible to produce, whereas light crude oils are very\n\n\n\n44\n\nfluid and relatively easy to produce.\n\nAll hydrocarbon products owe their origin to organic matter preserved in sedimentary rocks\n[Biju-Duval 2002]. A sedimentary rock is a rock composed of sediments, and a source rock\nis a rock that forms gas or oil. These sediments are relatively simple materials such as sands\ndeposited along beaches, mud on the sea bottom, and beds of seashells. As these sediments are\ndeposited, together with organic matter (dead plants and animals), both are mixed.\n\nThe portion of the Earth\u2019s surface in with sediments transported by water have accumulated\nover a significant portion of the geological time is called a sedimentary basin. The most com-\nmon site of sedimentary basins is in shallow marine environments around emerged continental\nareas. Also, but less frequently, a sedimentary basin can be found inside continental areas in\nlacustrine environments. As a result, the most part of the deposited sediments came from the\nseas, which have also contributed in the formation of the many sedimentary layers that com-\nposes a sedimentary basin. Mainly by the fact that during the vast expanse of geological time,\nsea levels has not been constant. Many times in the past, the seas have risen to cover the land\nand then fallen to expose the land [Hyne 2012].\n\nEven in the presence of a mixture of inorganic and organic sediments in a source rock,\nthe process of generation of oil and gas depends of many factors. In the subsurface, the most\nimportant factor in turning organic matter into oil is the temperature. The temperature for the\nformation of oil varies between 150?F (65?C), that occurs at a depth of about 7000 ft (2130\nm) below the surface, and 300?F (150?C) at about 18,000ft (5500 m) (Figure 4.1). This zone\nwhere the oil is generated is called the oil window (HYNE, 2012). Beside these conditions, the\nreactions that change organic matter into oil are complex and take a long time.\n\nFigure 4.1: Generation of gas and oil [Hyne 2012].\n\n\n\n45\n\nAfter oil and gas have been generated, they are firstly trapped in the pores of host sedi-\nmentary sources rocks. However, due the stress caused by a large increase in volume after the\ngeneration of a liquid (crude oil) or gas (natural gas) from a solid (organic matter), the source\nrock is fractured. As a result, due to their low density and the pressure gradient to which they\nare subjected, the oil and gas rise outside their host rocks through fractures in the subsurface\nrocks, as shown in Figure 4.2. The vertical and lateral flow of the gas and oil from source rock\nis called migration. The rising oil and gas may continue until they reach the ground surface\nor are stopped by an impermeable obstacle (the seal), which will accumulate these liquid or\ngaseous products in the trap. According to [Hyne 2012], among all the gas and oil generated in\na sedimentary rock basin, on the average, only 10% is trapped. The rest of the gas and oil either\ndid not get out of the source rock, was lost during migration, or seeped into the earth\u2019s surface.\n\nFigure 4.2: Hydrocarbon migration (adapted from:[Perrin and Rainaud 2013]).\n\nThe rock that can both store and transmit fluids is called reservoir rock. There are two\nimportant properties that a reservoir rock must have: porosity and permeability. Porosity is the\npercent volume of the rock that is not occupied by solids. Permeability is a measure of the ease\nwith which a fluid can flow through a rock. Therefore, the greater the permeability of a rock,\nthe easier it is for the fluids to flow through the rock. In the oil or gas reservoir, the oil or gas\nalways shares the pore spaces with water, but the relative amount of the fluid sharing the pores\nof the reservoir will vary from reservoir to reservoir and is called saturation.\n\nOnce the gas and oil migrates into the trap, they will find the water that also occurs in the\npores of the subsurface rocks, causing a natural separation process of the fluids according to\ntheir density. The lightest is the gas and goes to the top of the trap to form the free gas cap. The\n\n\n\n46\n\noil goes to the middle to form the oil reserve. The salt water, the heaviest, goes to the bottom.\nThis process may results in a hydrocarbon deposit, which is a portion of a sedimentary basin in\nwhich oil or gas has accumulated and are present in quantities that allow them to be profitably\nextracted.\n\nTherefore, the generation of oil and gas deposit depends of the migration of liquid or gaseous\nmatter upward through sediment and encounter a structural trap that has a seal consisting of a\nconcave volume of impermeable matter. Two common sedimentary rocks that can be seals\nare shale and salt. Figure 4.3 provides examples of structural traps. Identifying the format\nof reservoirs and the structure of petroleum traps are the main concern of the earth modeling\nactivities.\n\nFigure 4.3: Examples of structural traps [Perrin and Rainaud 2013]\n\nThus, in order to have a commercial deposit of gas or oil, three geological conditions must\nhave been met. First, there must be a source rock in the subsurface that generated the gas or oil\nat some time in the geological past. Second, there must be a subsurface reservoir rock to hold\nthe gas or oil. Third, there must be a trap on the reservoir rock to accumulate the gas or oil into\ncommercial quantities. Then, to find a hydrocarbon deposits we must first identify the basins\nwith have sediments with significant quantities of organic matter and where favorable conditions\nexisted for the transformation of this organic matter into hydrocarbons. Then, we must identify,\nalthough on a smaller scale, favorable structures where hydrocarbons were trapped in significant\nquantities and now constitute potential economically viable reservoirs.\n\n\n\n47\n\n4.2 Data derived from E&amp;P activities available for reservoir\nmodeling\n\nPetroleum industry depends on commercial deposit of gas or oil to continue active in the\nmarket. To accomplish this difficult task of finding good reservoirs, many professionals are\ninvolved, each of them responsible for a specific task. A geologist is a scientist who studies the\nearth by examining rocks and interpreting their history. A petroleum geologist specializes in\nthe exploration and development of petroleum reservoirs. An exploration geologist searches for\nnew gas and oil fields. A development geologist directs the drilling of wells to exploit a field. A\npetroleum geochemist uses chemistry to explore and develop petroleum reservoirs.\n\nThese professionals are involved in the analysis of reservoirs, which can be investigated ei-\nther by direct exploration of their rock content (geological approach) or indirectly by evaluating\nthe spatial distribution of one or more rock-related physical properties (geophysical approach).\nThe investigation process may be limited to the earth\u2019s surface, while using only geological\nmapping or remote sensing, or extended underground through the use of seismic analysis or\ndrilling.\n\n4.2.1 Seismic data\n\nOriginally, the seismic data was recorded by analog in the field on a sheet of paper. It was\nnoisy and not very accurate. According to [Hyne 2012], the greatest improvement in petroleum\nexploration in the last several decades have involved new seismic acquisition techniques and\ncomputer processing of digital seismic data.\n\nThe generation and recording of seismic data involves different techniques based on the\nanalysis of elastic waves generated in the earth by artificial means. It is then used to produce a\n2D time cross-section, interpreted by scientists to define the composition, fluid content, extent\nand geometry of rocks in the subsurface (Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary, 20091).\n\nThe interpretation of time cross-sections is very complex due to the fact that they repre-\nsent wave travel times and not actual depths. Moreover, the time/depth conversion demands a\ncomputationally intensive process, which requires careful planning because of the succession\nof modeling operations (modeling chain) involved.\n\nAt present, new seismic acquisition techniques and computer processing of digital seismic\ndata allowed the generation of models in three (3-D view) and four (4-D view) dimensions of\nthe subsurface. Thus, seismic data are the only source of information in a full 3D volume. How-\never, given that seismic information is made up of physical signals related to geological objects\nindirectly, seismic data provide only an indirect information about the geology. According to\n[Perrin and Rainaud 2013], seismic horizons cannot be thoughtlessly assimilated to geological\nhorizons, and there is no seismic signal that directly corresponds to a fault. Also, the extraction\n\n1http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/\n\n\n\n48\n\nof surfaces to be modeled is very difficult when realized from raw seismic data. As a result,\nthese raw data must be interpreted by geologists and geophysicists, since it involves both geo-\nlogical skill (identify structures of interest and surfaces relevant for modeling in seismic cubes\nor cross-sections) and image processing skill (follow the relevant seismic traces on a seismic\ncross-section or across 3D seismic data).\n\n4.2.2 Drilling data\n\nTogether with seismic data, drilling is the other major source of information used for reser-\nvoir studies and earth modeling. Drilling data provides well information, which can be used\nto characterize rocks (lithology, petrophysical properties) and calibrate other data. The types\nof information provided by drilling can be classified into three main categories: rock samples,\nwell logs and miscellaneous information (Figure 4.4).\n\nFigure 4.4: Information provided by well bores [Perrin and Rainaud 2013].\n\nAmong the rock samples that can be extracted from drilling operations, there are: core sam-\nple, cuttings and sidewall samples. The first one, are rock cylinders extracted during drilling.\nHowever, core sampling is a cumbersome, expensive, and time-consuming operation. As a re-\nsult, core samples are obtained for just a few drilling and on limited depth intervals only. The\nsecond one, cuttings, are small rock pieces cut by the drilling tool and brought up to the surface\nwith the mud flow that is used for cooling and lubricating the drill. Cuttings can be used to\n\n\n\n49\n\nprovide information about the various rocks encountered by the drill during its progress. How-\never, for a cutting to be considered a representative wallside sample, it is necessary determine\nits original position along the well trajectory. The last one, sidewall samples, are small plugs\ncut from the sides of the boreholes.\n\nThe second main category, well logs, are records of various parameters measured along the\nwell trajectory during or after drilling operations. There are three types of log: conventional\nwell logs, that provide information about lithology and reservoir quality; high resolution logs,\nthat provide complementary information concerning lithology (texture, microfracturation) and\nthe orientation of stratifications (dip); and geochemical logs, which help quantify the proportion\nof organic matter present in the rocks.\n\nFinally, the third main category, miscellaneous information, consists of measurements of\nparameters such as trajectory location, drilling advancement rate, and mud flow velocity, which\nare used to substantiate the data recorded along the well trajectory.\n\nThese drilling data (logs, cuttings and core data) is usually used on correlation activities\nbetween electric signatures and actual lithologies.\n\n4.2.3 Regional geology data\n\nAnother information source used for reservoir studies and earth modeling is the data related\nto the geology of the prospected area. These data are acquired by geologists in their studies\nof the field and are essential for geological interpretation. This information consists in texts or\nmaps, most often recorded in the form of paper documents, such as research papers, doctoral\ntheses, public or corporate reports.\n\n4.2.4 Laboratory data\n\nThe regional geology data are usually combined with laboratory data, also very important\nfor reservoir studies and earth modeling. The laboratory data includes: the petrography of\nrock thin sections, which provide detailed petrologic information and allow rock petrofacies\nto be defined; the results of tests on rock samples to determine properties such as porosity,\npermeability, transmissivity, mechanical strength, and so on; petrophysical properties can be\nstatic (porosity) or dynamic, that is, they depend on some external condition (transmissivity, for\nexample, depends on the differential pressure applied to both sides of a given rock sample); and\ngeochemical data resulting from chemical analysis of rocks or individual minerals. Depending\non their nature, the data are likely to be available as numerical data, image or graphic data, or\ntextual information.\n\n\n\n50\n\n4.3 Earth modeling\n\nIn the modern petroleum industry, earth models are key tools for identifying and character-\nizing potential hydrocarbon reservoirs. Earth models are three- (3D) or four-dimension (4D)\nrepresentations of data and interpretation concerning subsurface resources developed by geo-\nscientists who are responsible for evolving a hydrocarbon prospect through various stages of\nmodeling. Their final goal is the building of a reservoir model, which will be used for simulat-\ning oil accumulation in the underground. Currently, the building process involves a long chain\nof activities, which starts with data acquisition and proceeds with several different steps of data\nanalysis and interpretation. This chain of activities is known as the Earth Modeling Workflow or\nReservoir Modeling Workflow [Mastella 2010]. Figure 4.5 illustrates the most important steps\nof this workflow.\n\nFigure 4.5: The Earth Modeling Workflow (adapted from [Perrin et al. 2007]).\n\nThe first modeling activity is the definition of the spatial 3D area of interest, called prospect.\nThe available data concerning the prospect are derived from E&amp;P activities (explained in Sec-\ntion 4.2) such as seismic reflection (Figure 4.5(1)) and well boring drilling (Figure 4.5(2)). Also,\ngeoscientists take into account former studies about the prospect, such as documents concern-\ning regional geology, geological maps or cross-sections (Figure 4.5(3)). All these data must\ngo through a rigid quality control, in order to be validated, taking into account uncertainty val-\nues, and to verify their consistency. Moreover, the data are used by different professionals in\nvarious interpretation tasks, which fall into three broad types: selection, association and data\nmodification. An overview of the different interpretation task involved in the reservoir modeling\nworkflow is given in [Perrin and Rainaud 2013].\n\n\n\n51\n\nThe next task is the structural interpretation, which is a crucial step in the workflow because\nit is here that the structural model (Figure 4.5(4)) is built. The geoscientists use all available\ndata issued from regional geology studies and computer modeling tools (called geomodelers)\nto carry on this task. The surfaces identified by seismic interpretation are loaded in these tools,\nallowing the geoscientists specifying spatial and chronological relationships between the identi-\nfied objects. The topology of the object assemblage is of paramount importance since it strictly\ndepends from geological interpretation [Perrin 1998]. The structural model is the \u201cskeleton\u201d on\nwhich other earth models will be built, consisting in an assemblage of geological surfaces that\nmark the boundaries of individual geological blocks.\n\nThen, inside each of these blocks is build a stratigraphic mesh (Figure 4.5(5)) in an activity\ncalled stratigraphic modeling. Each cell of each mesh is affected by the petrophysical properties\nacquired from isolated points corresponding to samplings and to laboratory studies (Figure\n4.5(6)). Using geostatistic simulation, these properties are then propagated to the whole volume\n(Figure 4.5(7)). The resulting model, where the stratigraphic mesh cells are filled with rock\nproperties, is called stratigraphic model (Figure 4.5(8)).\n\nThis stratigraphic model mesh has its geometry transformed, in order to obtain a coarser\nreservoir mesh, and its property values upscaled (Figure 4.5(9)). The result of these tasks is\na reservoir model (Figure 4.5(10)), which provides a complete set of continuous reservoir pa-\nrameters (i.e. porosity, permeability, water saturation) for each cell of the 3D grid. Finally,\nthis model can be used by reservoir engineers to compute realistic hydrocarbon fluid migration\nsimulation (Figure 4.5(11)). In this simulation, the amount of exploitable hydrocarbon reserves\nin the prospect can be estimate, as well the quality of these reserves (heavy or light oil, gas etc.).\n\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n53\n\n5 CURRENT SOLUTIONS FOR GEOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE FORMALIZATION\n\nThe creation of a common work platform has always been a major concern for software\nproviders to the oil industry. However, from the user point of view, it is still very difficult to\ntransfer data from one application platform to another. The main reason is the complex his-\ntory of reservoir modeling market, characterized by extensions or redevelopments of products,\nsoftware acquisitions and company merging. In this market, the major software providers have\nintended to cover as much as they could all the steps of the reservoir characterization work-\nflow. However, considering the complexity of the reservoir modeling process and the quick\ntechnological evolutions, it was a very ambitious scope. In order to supply the deficiency of\nsome \u201cniches\u201d of excellence, some small software providers began to offer more specialized\nproducts, that started to replace some products designed by the major software providers and\nthat needed to be plugged into major earth modeling workflows.\n\nPerrin et al., in [Perrin and Rainaud 2013], presents the historical evolution of software\nproducts for earth modeling (represented in Figure 5.1), that began to emerge in the middle\nof 80\u2019s with the goal of representing geological surfaces and the spatial repartition of rock\npetrophysical properties. From these early times on, many software began to appear on the\nmarket according to two broad orientations: towards fluid flow simulation; and towards high-\nresolution representations of geology. During this period, geophysicists, geologists, and reser-\nvoir engineers were working in strictly separated departments with few communication among\nthem. This situation has prompted a third orientation of software development, which intends\nto integrate the various kinds of knowledge required for earth modeling in order to produce\n\u201cKnowledge based models\u201d.\n\nFigure 5.1: Historical evolution of software products for earth modeling presented in software\npackages categories by period of first appearance in the market [Perrin and Rainaud 2013].\n\n\n\n54\n\nHowever, the construction of this type of model requires that the oil companies agree on a\ncommon way of capturing knowledge about geological objects. According to the knowledge\nengineering community, the type of knowledge about the categories of objects that exist in a\ndomain, and about the manner in which these objects are organized, is called static knowl-\nedge [Mastella 2010]. Ontologies are shown to be the best approach to make explicit the static\nknowledge that expresses the common understanding about earth sciences domains.\n\nIn this chapter, we will present some of the ontologies formerly developed for Geosciences,\nin Section 5.1, and for 3D earth modeling, in Section 5.2. Among them, we can highlight\nthe Basic Geology ontology, proposed initially in [Mastella 2010] and keeps evolving. Finally,\nin the Section 5.3, we will describe the most used communication standard formats: LAS,\nWITSML and RESQML. This review about the current ontologies and standard formats will be\nuseful to understand how the main geological concepts, described in the ontologies, are stored\nin the standard formats\u2019 files, enabling the creation of mappings between them, as presented\nlater in this work.\n\n5.1 Ontologies developed for Geosciences\n\nIntense efforts were developed, during the last years, by various organizations for issuing\ncodifications and formalizations of geological knowledge. According to [Mastella 2010], these\nefforts can be classified in various categories according to the specific domains or activities that\nthey address: geological surveys; specific geoscience domains; and petroleum industry.\n\nGeological surveys are national or regional institutions, which are notably in charge of is-\nsuing geological maps. Their main goal is exchanging the information contained in field or\nlaboratory observations and linking it with the objects that they intend to represent on a geolog-\nical map. Between the geological surveys, a few models stand out. The NADM model (North\nAmerican Geologic Map Data Model [Richard 2006])1 and the derived GeoSciML2 model are\ndesigned as ontologies for developing interoperable geologic map-centered databases. The\nGeoSciML formalization is based in addition on the normative GML (Geography Markup Lan-\nguage) for the representation of geographic features and geometry. The GEON (Geosciences\nNetwork)3 project is interested for its part in the problem of integrating geologic maps, whose\nsource files contain geologic age or rock type information in the tables with different schemata\nand vocabularies.\n\nFor specific geoscience domains, many knowledge models were defined as well as spe-\ncialized domain ontologies and upper level ontologies. Some of these models are to be found\nin [Sinha 2006]. In addition to those, stand out the ontologies proposed in: [Abel 2001], for\npetrographic description of reservoir rocks; [Cox and Richard 2005] and [Perrin et al. 2011]\n\n1http://ngmdb.usgs.gov/www-nadm/\n2http://www.geosciml.org/\n3http://www.geongrid.org/\n\n\n\n55\n\nfor geological time; [Lorenzatti et al. 2009], for modeling of sedimentary structures and tex-\ntual features of rocks; and [Carbonera 2012], for sedimentary stratigraphy. Some of them are\nproposed to be upper-level ontologies, which define high-abstract objects in some domains, in-\ntended to support the organization and knowledge interchanging is some area of knowledge.\nThat is the case of the ontologies proposed by the project SWEET (Semantic Web for Earth and\nEnvironmental Terminology), which includes several thousand terms, spanning a broad extent\nof concepts from Earth system sciences and related concepts [Raskin and Pan 2005].\n\nAmong the oil companies projects, stand out the IPP (Integrated Information Platform,\n[Omdal 2006, Sandsmark and Mehta 2004] project, comprising one of the largest ontologies\never developed for an industrial field for formalizing the terminology used in petroleum pro-\nduction. The project addresses many domains, such as subsea production equipment, seismic,\ndrilling and logging, reservoir evaluation, but does not include earth sciences. Parts of the on-\ntology are based on the ISO 15926 standard, for oil and gas production life-cycle data, which\nconsiderably differs from the oil and gas exploration life-cycle data, but they also include con-\ncepts issued from other terminologies.\n\n5.2 Ontologies for earth modeling\n\nOntologies for 3D earth modeling differ from those ontologies developed for geosciences or\nfor petroleum production industry due the fact that they were built specifically for representing\nknowledge about 3D geological modeling, i.e., for describing the objects that are manipulated\nwithin earth modeling workflows. These ontologies began to be developed from 2001 on, when\nthe IFP4/ENSMP5 team for Geo-modeling developed a new knowledge-driven paradigm for\nreservoir studies based on the belief that geo-model building should not be directly depen-\ndent from data (data-driven) but rather from geoscientists\u2019 interpretations (knowledge-driven)\n[Rainaud et al. 2005]. In 2005, the IFP/ENSMP team issued the first version of a Geo-ontology.\nThis ontology was described in [Perrin et al. 2005].\n\nAfter the issued of this first Geo-ontology, stood out the Basic Geology ontology, defined\nin [Mastella 2010], that describes and interconnects geological entities considered in reservoir\nmodeling. This ontology is divided into sub-ontologies, which provide more detail to the main\ntop-level concepts, and into other domain ontologies, which represent fields that are indepen-\ndent of the Basic Geology ontology, but whose concepts are used by its concepts. The domain\nontologies linked to the Basic Geology ontology are: GeoLocation ontology, an ontology of\ngeographical terms; ontologies for the disciplines of Palaeogeography, Lithology and Hydro-\ngeology; and ontologies for defining and managing geological ages: Geological Time and Ge-\nological Dating ontologies (both formalized in [Mastella 2010]). The Figure 5.2 presents the\ntop-level part of the Basic Geology ontology.\n\n4http://www.ifpenergiesnouvelles.com/\n5http://www.mines-paristech.fr/\n\n\n\n56\n\nFigure 5.2: The top level Basic Geology ontology [Mastella 2010].\n\nThe original definition of the ontology can be found in the site of the E-WOK HUB (Environ-\nmental Web Ontology Knowledge Hub) 6 project. The RDFS/OWL version of the ontologies\nrelated to this project can be downloaded from this same site7.\n\nIn the Section 5.2.1 we will describe some details about the Basic Geology ontology in order\nto clarify the objects related to the concept GeologicalObject, which will be used further as a\ncase study to exemplify the methodology proposed in our work.\n\n5.2.1 Description of the Basic Geology ontology\n\nThe Geological Object ontology summarizes a diversified amount of endurant geological\nobjects that can be simple or complex (examples among many other are: a stratified sedimentary\nunit, a reef, a diapir, a fault network, etc.). Complex geological objects can be made of a various\nnumber of atomic geological objects. The Basic Geology ontology was proposed with the\nimportant role of providing high level, general geological objects that helps in linking further\nknowledge and data representations.\n\nThere are two kinds of elementary geological objects [Mastella 2010]:\n\n6http://www.inria.fr/sophia/edelweiss/projects/ewok/\n7http://www-sop.inria.fr/edelweiss/projects/ewok/ontologyview/ontologies.html/\n\n\n\n57\n\n\u2022 2D objects, corresponding to Geological Boundaries, such as the erosion surface E, the\nfault F and the upper and lower boundaries bu and bl on Figure 5.3;\n\n\u2022 3D objects, which are Geological Units, such as the sedimentary unit U limited by the\nboundaries bu and bl on Figure 5.3. A Geological Unit is a volume of continuous geo-\nlogical matter limited by one or several Geological Boundaries.\n\nFigure 5.3: Geological objects: Erosion surface E, fault F and Sedimentary strata unit U, con-\nstituted of volume and boundaries bu and bl [Mastella 2010].\n\n5.3 Communication standard formats\n\nA huge amount of data formats and standards are being used for data exchange in reservoir\ncharacterization models. Usually, these data are stored in different file formats and represented\nin different formats.\n\nThe Geological File ontology defines the file formats used for storing information related\nto geological data. Basically, every data are stored in textual documents or classified as one-\ndimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional documents, according to the way in which\nthe data are stored (one, two or three dimensional arrays). Among those formats, the LAS\nand the WITSML standards store geophysical log data in one-dimensional documents. The\nRESQML standard stores its data in three-dimensional documents, divided by three model\ntypes: \u2018Reservoir\u2019, \u2018Structural\u2019 and \u2018Stratigraphic\u2019. Figure 5.4 represents a part of the Geolog-\nical File ontology with the concepts related with the LAS, WITSML and RESQML standard\nformats.\n\nPRODML (PRODuction-ML) is an industry standard that supports data exchange repre-\nsenting the flow of fluids from the point they enter into the wellbore to the point of custody\ntransfer, together with production operation workflows, in a vendor-neutral, open format. As\nwell as WITSML and RESQML, it was proposed by the Energistics Consortium8 with the in-\ntention of covering the whole exploration and production chain of petroleum data exchanging.\nThe PRODML includes standardized objects for: DTS Measurements; Fluid Analyses; Fluid\nSamples; Flow Networks; Production Operations Reports; Production Reports; Historical Data;\n\n8http://www.energistics.org/\n\n\n\n58\n\nFigure 5.4: The concepts related with the LAS, WITSML and RESQML standard formats in\nGeological File Ontology.\n\nWell Tests; and Wireline Formation Tests. However, none of these objects are directed related\nwith geological objects. For this reason, this standard has no geological entities or correspon-\ndence with the Geological File ontology and, therefore, will not be analyzed in our study.\n\nThe LAS (Log ASCII Standard) format began with the aim of a simple format for exchang-\ning well log data. The worldwide acceptance of LAS proved the need for such a format. The\nCanadian Well Logging Society 9 introduced the LAS standard, in 1989, to standardize the orga-\nnization of digital log curve information for personal computer users. Version 1.2 was the first\nversion to be used in industry and was followed, in September 1992, by version 2.0, in order to\naddress some inconsistencies. A more versatile version, LAS 3.0, was released in 1999. How-\never, LAS 2.0 remains the dominant product until now. LAS 3.0 clarifies several of the poorly\ndefined specifications of LAS 2.0 and provides expanded data storage capabilities, but has seen\nlimited implementation. In this work, we will focus on LAS version 3.0.\n\nLAS 3.0 files are divided into logical sections. Each section begins with a title line, which\nis marked with a tilde (~) at the beginning of the line. Sections contain lines where data is\ndescribed and/or stored. There are several types of sections and several types of lines within\nsections. The LAS 3.0 standard defines which combinations of sections must exist in LAS files,\nand in which order. For example, the ~Version and ~Well section must exist in that order in any\nfile of the version 3.0 LAS. As in LAS version 2.0, only one well is described within a single\nfile.\n\nAs we saw before in the Geological File ontology, the LAS standard stores \u201cWell Log\u201d\ndata in one-dimensional ASCII documents, meaning that the data are stored in one-dimensional\narrays. However, when representing information through arrays, LAS version 3.0 allows that\nthese documents have data stored as one, two or three-dimensional arrays, something that was\n\n9http://www.cwls.org/\n\n\n\n59\n\nnot possible until this version. The data are usually indexed to depth or time, but may be\npresented as discrete measurements if required. Also, data are grouped by type into related\nsections, as they relate to the well where the data was acquired. Types include depth and time\nindexing logging, core, inclinometry, drilling, formation tops, test data, user defined types, etc.\nIn the Chapter 7 we will present an ontological analysis of these types.\n\nOn the other hand, the WITSML (Wellsite Information Transfer Standard Markup Lan-\nguage)10 is a standard used for sending well site information in an XML document format\ndeveloped to promote the right-time, seamless flow of well data between operators and service\ncompanies, as well as regulatory agencies, in order to speed and enhance decision-making and\nreporting.\n\nA WITSML document consists in one or more complete WITSML data-objects that corre-\nspond to a logical representation and organization of the data items associated with the major\ncomponents and operations involved in well drilling - such as well, wellbore or log - represented\nas an XML document, which is essentially a text string. Thus, each WITSML data-object is de-\nfined by an XML schema and its own document. Each schema defines a set of data that can\nbe transmitted within a single XML document and represents a cohesive subset (e.g. well,\nwellbore, rig, etc.) of an overall logical schema related to a single domain (well). Data ob-\nject schemas contain attributes, elements, and included component sub-schemas. Figure 5.5\nrepresents the WITSML data objects relationships.\n\nFigure 5.5: The WITSML data objects relationships [Energistics and SIG 2012].\n\nComponent schemata are XML schemata, but these schemata do not represent complete\ndata objects and do not contain global elements. A component schema may be used by more\nthan one data object schema. All component schemata are prefixed with (cs_). Each component\nschema file generally defines one type that has the same name as the file name.\n\n10http://www.energistics.org/drilling-completions-interventions/witsml-standards\n\n\n\n60\n\nFinally, the RESQML is an industry initiative to provide open, non-proprietary data ex-\nchange standards for reservoir characterization, earth and reservoir models proposed by Ener-\ngistics\u2019s Special Interest Groups (SIG)11 that includes most of 3D-modeling software providers\nbesides most of large petroleum companies and it getting fast acceptance. RESQML is an XML-\nbased data exchange standard that helps addressing the data-incompatibility and data-integrity\nchallenges faced by professionals in petroleum industry when using the multiple software tech-\nnologies required along the entire subsurface workflow, for analysis, interpretation, modeling,\nand simulation.\n\nThe release available for the public is RESQML V2.0 [Endres et al. 2013, Deny et al. 2013],\nwhich evolves from V1.1 by incorporating more semantic to the representation model. The key\ngoal of this version is to provide a mechanism for transferring relationship information (between\ndata-objects, such as faults, horizons and grids), while continuing to expand the fundamental\ndata types within the standard, for example, unstructured simulation grids.\n\nThere are significant differences between the two RESQML versions. Among them, we\ncan highlight that in the RESQML V2.0, the concepts feature, interpretation and representation\n(introduced by RESQML V1.1 for individual structural components such as horizons and faults)\nare applied to more individual elements, like FluidBoundaries, Geobodies, StratigraphicUnit,\nand FluidFlowUnit. Also, the RESQML V2.0 defines some new concepts [Endres et al. 2013]:\norganization, organization interpretation, and organization representation. The objective is to\ngather the relationships between individual features. Thus, V2.0 organization structures allow\na more flexible association of the model elements as well as partial model descriptions. The\nmain intention on RESQML V2.0 is to capture the steps of interpretation between each step of\nthe modeling process, preserving the author and the evidences of interpretation. This capability\nallows that some misunderstanding of features along of the modeling process can be tracked\nand corrected without affecting the whole result.\n\nIn RESQML V1.1, a RESQML document consisted of one XML file and one HDF5 file,\nassociated together by standard naming conventions. V1.1 used what was essentially a hierar-\nchical data model, such that all semantic information was assembled in only one XML instance\nconsisting of one XML file, with hierarchical \u201cimplicit\u201d XML containment to associate the\ndata-objects together. The optional HDF5 file was used for better processing efficiency of large\narrays of data. Both XML and HDF5 are still used in RESQML V2.0, but now multiple XML\nand HDF5 files are used.\n\nRESQML has also moved from a hierarchical data model to an object-relationship data\nmodel to organize its data-objects. This change allowed the components of the earth model to\nbe represented as separate data-objects and the relationships among them to be more accurately\nrepresented as parent-child, with one-to-many or many-to-may relationships.\n\nThus, V2.0 is a significant redesign of RESQML V1.1, including more and richer data-\nobjects, a clearly defined knowledge hierarchy, and the ability to create and transfer complete\n\n11www.energistics.org/reservoir/resqml-sig\n\n\n\n61\n\nor partial models [Energistics and SIG 2014].\nA RESQML data-object, which is now stored in a separate XML file, contains the seman-\n\ntics associated with the data model (or modeling data) in the context of RESQML. V2.0 in-\ntroduced a new design that supports the transfer of abstract subsurface features, human inter-\npretations of those features, the data representations of those interpretations, and the properties\nindexed onto those representations, which results in a well-defined knowledge hierarchy of\nfeature/interpretation/representation/properties (informally referred to as \u201cFIRP\u201d) (Figure 5.6).\nEach of these terms is a type of RESQML data-object. V2.0 also includes the relationships\nbetween them, which allows a more precise classification.\n\nFigure 5.6: The feature/interpretation/representation/properties knowledge hierarchy\n[Energistics and SIG 2014].\n\nFeature can be defined as something that has physical existence at some point during the\nexploration, development, production, or abandonment of a reservoir. Features are divided into\ntwo categories: geological features, which are objects that exist a priori, in the natural world\n(e.g., a boundary), and technical features that are objects that exist by the action of humans\n(e.g., a well).\n\nInterpretation can be explained as a single consistent description of a feature. An interpreta-\ntion is subjective and very strongly tied to the intellectual activity of the project team members.\n\nRepresentation is a digital description of a feature or an interpretation and contains the\ntopology and geometry of a structural feature. Topology defines how to associate nodes and\nother \u201cindexable elements\u201d to represent points, lines, surfaces or volumes (like structured and\nunstructured grids). Geometry is the spatial location of each selected indexable element, mainly\n\n\n\n62\n\nnodes. This information may be provided as numerical arrays stored in HDF5 datasets, or\nspecified implicitly.\n\nA property can be attached to any indexable element of any representation. Properties refer\nto semantic variables (for example, porosity, permeability, etc.) and the corresponding data\nvalues, which are recorded in arrays, which may be stored in HDF5 datasets.\n\nFor each of these data-objects, independently of its level, each instances is uniquely identi-\nfied with a UUID and metadata (a citation data-object). In this work, we will analyze only those\ninstances related to the data-object features (e.g., boundary, rock, stratigraphic unit, etc.).\n\n\n\n63\n\n6 PRODUCING MORE INTEGRABLE MODELS\n\nIn order to produce more integrable models, we first need to deal with the heterogeneity\nin geological information. The construction of a final reservoir model requires the integration\nof data sets across different disciplines related to earth sciences, such as geophysics, geol-\nogy, petrology and petrophysics. This multi-disciplinary problem can be seen as a problem of\nperspectival heterogeneity, as explained in Section 2.2 of Chapter 2, in which various models\nrepresent various points of view in relation to the same domain of interest.\n\nThe integration of these heterogeneous and multi-disciplinary data allows the emergence of\nnew knowledge, which is essential for timely and correctly decision-making. However, inte-\ngration in this context means finding correspondence between entities without looking for the\nidentity of the instances themselves. In that way, we can reach integration by identifying enti-\nties (that exist in the real world) being represented differently among various models and data\nsources and by offering an integrated vision of those entities through a mapping between them\nand a common vocabulary of a particular community. We propose the use of ontologies to solve\nthis issue.\n\nAt this point, the first challenge that must be faced is the problem of reaching interoperabil-\nity. We claim that interoperability can be reached by making apparent the meaning of the geo-\nlogical concepts represented in the models. Figure 6.1 illustrates a common situation that can\nhappen in a modeling scenario: a geological concept being represented differently among mod-\nels. In the illustrated example, the geological concept named Sedimentary Unit is represented\nin three different ways. In order to reach interoperability among these three representations, we\nneed to determine how each of them represents a Sedimentary Unit and the exactly places that\nthe data and interpretations referring this concept are stored. Thus, this concept could be used\nto anchor these three models.\n\nFigure 6.1: A Sedimentary Unit being represented differently in three models.\n\n\n\n64\n\nHowever, this solution results in a new question: can any geological concept be used to\nanchor the models? The answer for this question is no. The geological concepts are very sus-\nceptible to modeling errors, since each professional involved in a modeling process can have\ndifferent conceptualizations about entities of the world. Furthermore, the available represen-\ntational languages applied by the experts, usually cannot distinguish some entities, since the\nlanguages applied for the representations do not keep a fair syntactical and ontological capabil-\nity for representing world entities. What is needed, therefore, is a conceptual tool that allows\none to explicit differences between entities of the world that representational languages usually\nconsider as being of same type, and to decide which objects exist in the world reality. Then,\nin order to increase the semantic of each geological object, we applied the concepts of founda-\ntional ontology. The use of UFO meta-types, described in Chapter 3, allowed us to explicit the\ndifferences between the many entities of the world directly involved with reservoir modeling,\nsolving the lack of expressivity of representational languages.\n\nThus, using the previously example, Figure 6.2 presents the classification of a Sedimen-\ntary Unit according to UFO meta-types. In this example, we classified a Sedimentary Unit\nas a Kind. Moreover, we considered that the representations of the classified concept are in-\nstances described by the data and interpretations stored in interchange data formats, such as\nLAS, WITSML and RESQML.\n\nFigure 6.2: Using UFO meta-types to clarify the meaning of geological concepts.\n\nThus, the second challenge that must be faced is to determine which concepts can be used\nto anchor the models. We claim that only those concepts that preserve the identity through\ntime (rigid concepts) and that are countable (whole concepts) can be used. The reason is that\nrigid concepts can be found in all models and can be used to support the interoperability among\nsystems.\n\nWe will show that the use of ontological tools can help the modeler in creating more inte-\n\n\n\n65\n\ngrable models. More specifically, referring to the UFO methodology, exposed in Section 3.1 of\nChapter 3, we will show that the use of ontological concept notions of identity, rigidity, essen-\ntiality and unity allows modelers to distinguish which concepts exist in world reality and which\nof them are distinguished from each other.\n\n6.1 Proposed methodological approach\n\nIn this section, we will describe the methodology defined and applied to analyze the several\nstandards being used by petroleum industry nowadays (the result of our ontological analysis\nwill be presented in the Chapter 7). Our approach aims to explicit the semantic of geologic\nconcepts presented in these standards, assisting in solving problems of semantic heterogeneity.\n\nThe first step (1) is to identify an ontology that covers the entities represented by the data.\nThe chosen ontology should describe and interconnect all entities considered in the integration\nprocess. In order to accomplish this task, it will be necessary to perform a survey into the\nliterature to discover if the available ontologies have all considered concepts. Alternatively, the\nvocabulary of various ontologies can be used. In the case that no available ontology satisfies\nthe requirements, a new one should be built.\n\nThe second step (2) is to analyze the chosen ontology in order to identify the rigid and anti-\nrigid types, the definitional relationships (which generate the relational dependencies) and the\nessential properties of the concepts. In the case that a foundational ontology has been chosen,\nthis step could be very simple. However, when a domain ontology has been chosen, a lot\nof effort could be necessary. Moreover, this step requires the knowledge of an expert in the\ndomain. It is an essential task in order to identify the entities that exist in the real word.\n\nThe third step (3) is to analyze the datasets in order to identify the entities that can be\nmapped to the ontology\u2019s rigid types (identified in the step (2)) through their names and essential\nproperties.\n\nIn this approach, as a first basic indication, we assumed that two individuals are the same\nwhen they have the same name. However, considering geological models, for instance, this\nstatement is not always true, since we can find many cases where a same name is applied to\ndistinct ontological objects (polysemy). The concept Rock, for instance, can refer to a Rock\nSample, to a Rock Unit and so forth.\n\nIn order to define if two modeled concepts are the same, independent of their names, we\nproposed the identification of their rigid properties, allowing structural matching. Thus, we\nconsidered that two entities are the same if (1) they are described by the same set of attributes,\n(2) each one of these attributes is instantiated to the same values and (3) each entity are related\nwith the same objects in reality (if they have concrete existence). This task will be as easier as\nthe language applied for the representation keeps a fair syntactical and ontological capability\nfor representing world entities. Guarino, in [Guarino 1998], describes this capability as the\nontological commitment of the language with the entities of the representation.\n\n\n\n66\n\nThe forth step (4) is to analyze the identified entities under the view of their ontological\nproperties: identity (supplies (O) or carries (I) identity); rigidity (R); relational dependence\n(D); and unity (U). For each of these properties, it is necessary to analyze if the instances of the\nentities hold (+), not hold (-), or can hold or not ( ) the property without affecting their exis-\ntence. This analysis will increase the semantic of each entity found in heterogeneous datasets,\nresolving the lack of expressivity of representational languages. This is a very critical step since\nit will allow the mapping of entities from different datasets to the same ontology.\n\nFinally, the last step (5) is to perform the mapping between the entities identified in step (3)\nand classified in step (4) with the chosen ontology and its concepts analyzed in step (2).\n\nThus, applying all these five steps correctly, data and information integration can be achieved,\nsince integration in this context means finding correspondence between entities without merg-\ning the corresponding instances and by identifying the entities of the real world that the data\ndescribe [Guizzardi 2005].\n\n\n\n67\n\n7 ONTOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF STANDARD DATA FORMATS\n\nIn order to exemplify the proposed methodological approach, we will use as a case study\nthe communication standard formats that are going to become standard in the modeling chain:\nLAS, WITSML, and RESQML. Despite being an application domain particularly difficult, this\ncase of study is interesting in the context of information integration because it describes and\ninterconnects concepts that must match with different geological models considered in reservoir\nmodeling. The result of the performed analysis is also available in [Werlang et al. 2014].\n\n7.1 Step 1: Choosing the ontology\n\nWe started our analysis by searching and studying the current solutions for geological\nknowledge formalization, described in Chapter 5, looking for ontologies that cover the geologi-\ncal concepts that exist in real word and are represented in different models along the petroleum\nchain and could have their data stored in the data standard formats analyzed in this case study.\n\nAs a result of our first analysis, we ended up choosing the Basic Geology ontology. Thus,\ninstead of developing the ontology from scratch, we reused it, once its structure was already\nset up by experts. Figure 5.4 presents our modified version of the chosen ontology adherent to\nontological principles of modeling.\n\nFigure 7.1: The top level Basic Geology ontology modified from [Mastella 2010] to describe\nthe ontological meaning of relationships.\n\n\n\n68\n\n7.2 Step 2: Analyzing the chosen ontology\n\nThen, following the proposed methodological approach, we analyzed the main concepts of\nthe chosen ontology in order to identify their rigid types and their definitional relationships.\nThe analyzed concepts were: Substance, Geological Boundaries, Geological Units, Geological\nStructures and Geological Event. We started our analysis by the main concepts related with\nour case study: Geological Boundaries, Geological Units and Geological Structures. All of\nthem are rigid objects that preserve the unity property. This means that their instances in reality\ncannot stop being instances of these objects or they would disappear. Along with the concept\nSubstance, they are the most important concepts for data. We will detail the ontological prop-\nerties and relationships of these concepts in the way geologists usually conceive them.\n\nSubstances, whose nature is detailed in the Substance ontology (such as Rocks), fill geolog-\nical units, making possible geological units to exist in space. It is equivalent to the meta-type\namount of matter as described in [Guarino and Welty 2009]. A geological unit provides unity\nto an instance of rock, but not identity. The identity of a rock is given by its internal properties,\nsuch as composition, texture, fabric. A sub-class of a substance needs to preserve the same\nidentity properties. A taxonomy of the concept rock would include carbonate and siliciclastic\nrocks, but rock cannot subsume the concept sill (a horizontal intrusion of rock) as a sub-class of\nrock, since the identity of sill is not provided by a lithology, but by some lithological unit with\na particular format and position.\n\nThe relationship between a geological unit and a rock is called constitution. When we say\nthat a geological unit has some property like granulometry, we are meaning that the substance\nthat constitutes a lithological unit has this property, but not the unit itself. When we assert that\na lake is salty, we indeed refer to the property of the water that is inside the lake. Taking care\nof preserving the independence and the specific properties of two concepts collocated in space\nsuch as rock and geological unit will allow us to integrate them within other applications in a\nmuch easier way.\n\nGeological boundaries, in contrast with geological units, have no internal constitution.\nHowever, they are still rigid concepts that are an inseparable part of a geological unit (ac-\ncording to the classification of [Guizzardi 2005]). Geological structures are also rigid objects\nand inseparable parts of geological units, whose identity is defined by geometric internal and\nexternal properties.\n\nThese few objects - boundaries, structures, units and substance - are omnipresent in earth\nmodels and are specialized, extended and derived to represent all the different aspects that\nsome model aims to emphasize. Most of problems in earth model integration are related to the\nproblem that substance and rigid objects are collocated in the space (such as the sill and rock that\nconstitute the sill) but still have proper independent ontological identity. The misuse of rock and\nits several types of portions (sample, core, unit, etc.) can led to wrong geological interpretations\ninside the information systems. It is important to stress that only rigid objects and those objects\n\n\n\n69\n\nthat they subsume (their subclasses) have instances, which means that any instance manipulated\nby some software application can be mapped to these few objects and further integrated. That\nstatement is the basis for our approach. Figure 7.2 illustrates the explained relationships.\n\nFigure 7.2: Relationships among the main entities considering an earth modeling scenario.\n\nOther concepts that will be further analyzed in this work have an anti-rigid identity, which\nmeans that they can preserve their existence when they lose their identity. Such concepts are\nexistentially dependent of another concept to exist. A reservoir1, a source-rock and a trap are\nexamples of roles played by rock units and geological structures, without configuring a special-\nization of rock unit. Any instance of reservoir or a source rock is necessarily an instance of a\ngeological unit, and an instance of a trap is necessarily an instance of geological structure.\n\nThe Basic Geology ontology does not describe concepts to represent the different bodies\nof rocks created by human actions, such as cores and samples. We assume that a concept in a\ndistinct domain ontology related to well development would subsumes the concepts Core and\nSample utilized in our classification. We named it SampleOfRock to be mentioned in this work\nand it represents all partial exposition of a rock, spatially delimited by human action, such as\ncore, samples and thin-section. Also, we consider that the concept Rock is a specialization of\nSubstance.\n\nBesides the endurant universals described above, the Basic Geology ontology also describe\nthe perdurant concept Geological Event, that instantiates individuals that are composed by tem-\n\n1We consider in this work that the existence of a reservoir is related to a rock unit with presence of oil, not only\nto a rock with intrinsic properties like porosity and permeability. The relational dependence between rock unit and\npetroleum allows us to classify reservoir as an anti-rigid object. If we would consider a reservoir as a rock with\nsome amount of porosity and permeability, independent of having petroleum or not, it would be a rigid concept.\n\n\n\n70\n\nporal parts and have no physical representations in reality. A geological event may consist of a\nsingle Geological Process (e.g. the deposition of a sedimentary unit) or be composed of mul-\ntiple geological processes (e.g., a graben filled with syntectonic sediments deposited while the\nfaults limiting the graben were in movement). The various specializations of geological pro-\ncess, corresponding to creation, destruction or transformation of geological matter, are detailed\nin the Geological Process sub-ontology.\n\nThe Basic Geology ontology is complemented by universals that have no identity and are\nexistentially dependent of other objects. They describe the properties that characterize the con-\ncepts and are usually of special interest in reservoir characterization. Attribute domains are\nassociated to conceptual spaces and integrated through rigid objects. However, we will not\ndiscuss here how to deal with interoperability in the case of attributes.\n\n7.3 Step 3 and 4: Analyzing the standard formats data files and the identified entities\n\nIn this section, we will present the result of the analysis performed with the standard formats\ndata files. This section contemplates the steps 3 and 4 from the proposed methodology. Each\ndata standard format has its own subsections: LAS (7.3.1 and 7.3.2) WITSML (7.3.3 and 7.3.4)\nand RESQML (7.3.5 and 7.3.6).\n\nIn our analysis, we considered only those objects that exist a priori in the natural world.\nAlthough others data-objects may have some data related to those analyzed objects and have\nsubstantial information to the modeling process, they are not within the scope of this work.\n\n7.3.1 LAS: Step 3\n\nWe analyzed each data section set, including all parameter and definition data described in\nthe LAS 3.0 File Structure Specifications [Heslop et al. 2000], searching for possible mappings\nwith the chosen ontology. Between the analyzed data sections, we identified two data sections\nthat store data with possible mappings with the chosen ontology. A brief description of the\nidentified data sections is listed in the Table 7.1. Figures 7.3 and 7.4 provide more details about\nthe possible mappings found.\n\nCore Data Section It includes information about the\ncore, such as core source, core type,\nprimary formation cored, core oil\nand water saturation and volume.\n\nSubstance, Geological Unit.\n\nTop Data Section It includes information about the\nformation tops, such as formation\ntop source and formation name.\n\nGeological Unit, Geological\nObject.\n\nTable 7.1: The selected LAS data sections and their descriptions.\n\n\n\n71\n\nThe Core Data Section contains data sections that store data referring to attributes of Oil\nand Water that can be mapped to concepts from Substance sub-ontology. This data set also has\nparameters with possible mapping, like Core Source (mapped to Mineralogy sub-ontology) and\nCore Type (mapped to Lithology sub-ontology). However, both concepts represent the substance\nRock, described in the Substance sub-ontology. Another parameter of the core data section is\nthe Primary Formation Cored, which can be mapped to Geological Unit sub-ontology.\n\nThe Top Data Section has the parameter Formation Top Source that refers to a Lithostrati-\ngraphic Unit described in the Geological Unit sub-ontology. This concept is defined by data\nlike Formation Name, which is an attribute of a Sedimentary Unit from Geological Object sub-\nontology.\n\nFigure 7.3: Possible mappings found between the LAS standard and Basic Geology ontology:\nCore Data Section.\n\n7.3.2 LAS: Step 4\n\nOur next analysis shows the classification of the geological concepts found in the selected\ndata set sections, according to the properties of identity, rigidity, essentiality and unity. The\nanalyzed concepts were: Lithological Unit, Formation, Core, Oil, Water and Rock.\n\nA Lithological Unit is a body of rock that is sufficiently distinctive and continuous for\nbeing mapped. The concept Lithological Unit offers the principle of identity for its instances,\nsince geologists are able to distinguish one instance from another by observing their visual\n\n\n\n72\n\nFigure 7.4: Possible mappings found between the LAS standard and Basic Geology ontology:\nTop Data Section.\n\ncharacteristics. Also, this concept provides the principle of unity for their instances. This\nprinciple involves the observation of discontinuities in the visual characteristics of some body\nof rock, allowing the geologist to distinguish different lithological units. Furthermore, this\nconcept is rigid, since its instances cannot fail to be so, unless it ceases to exist.\n\nIf the age and stratigraphic position of a Lithological Unit can be determined, this unit is\nreferred as a Formation and it is given a name in order to support stratigraphic correlation. Even\nif the identity of the concept Formation is defined by rigid properties (like the lithological prop-\nerty age), there are no instances of the concept Formation that are not instances of Lithological\nUnit. Actually, a Formation does not exist until some Lithological Unit is identified as such by\ngeologists. This shows an existential dependence that is not acceptable for a rigid concept. Con-\nsequently, Formation is an anti-rigid concept and plays a \u201crole\u201d for some Lithological Unit. So,\nin terms of integration, a Formation should be mapped to a Lithological Unit in other models.\n\nA Core is a cylindrical sample extracted from a Lithological Unit that is being drilled. It is\ncomposed by one or more types of rocks. It is a specialization of SampleOfRock and it has a\nrelationship of constitution with Rock. It is a rigid concept that preserves identity and unity.\n\nAmong the analyzed concepts, the concepts Oil and Water do not have unity, since they\ncan only be individualized by other concepts (like a barrel of oil, a bottle of water, or a sample\nof rock). They are rigid concepts: they cannot stop being Water and Oil, without stopping to\nexist. But they are both uncountable objects, whose instances need to be individuated through\n\n\n\n73\n\na container, for instance, a reservoir. Water and Oil are interesting for modeling in relation of\ntheir internal properties. When they are presented in some application, rigid and not unified\nobjects preserve a relation of container or location with some rigid and whole entity (e.g., oil\nis present within a reservoir). So, rigid and not unified objects are identified by their internal\nproperties rather than by their spatial characteristics.\n\nLess intuitively, the concept of Rock (specialization of Substance) in Geology is similar\nin ontological terms to Oil and Water. Rock is a rigid concept with no unity property. It is\nindividuated by some other entities, typically a Lithological Unit, a Core, a Sample or a Layer\nin an outcrop, with whom rocks have the ontological relation of constitution.\n\nThe result of this analysis is presented in the Table 7.2.\n\nType\nOntological Rigidity Relational Unity Ontological\n\nIdentity Dependence Category\nOil O+I+ R+ D- U- Quantity\nWater O+I+ R+ D- U- Quantity\nRock O+I+ R+ D- U- Quantity\nLithological Unit O+I+ R+ D- U+ Kind\nSampleOfRock O+I+ R+ D- U+ Kind\nFormation O-I+ R- D+ U- Role\n\nTable 7.2: The result of the classification realized with LAS types.\n\n7.3.3 WITSML: Step 3\n\nThe WITSML standard enumerates 113 types with valid values for those elements. Ana-\nlyzing these enumerated types, we identified 9 types whose values can be mapped to concepts\nfrom the Basic Geology ontology. A brief description of the identified type names is listed in\nthe Table 7.3. Figures 7.5, 7.6 and 7.7 provide more details about the possible mapping between\nthe presented ontology and the involved WITSML data objects.\n\n7.3.4 WITSML: Step 4\n\nAs we did with LAS types, we classified the geological concepts found in the selected\nWITSML data objects according to the presented properties from foundational ontologies. The\nidentified concepts were: Oil, Water, Gas, Rock, Cuttings Samples, Formation, Core and Mud.\nThe concepts Oil, Water, Rock, Formation and Core were already analyzed in the LAS anal-\nysis and were already classified in Section 7.3.2 (result presented in the Table 7.2). Thus, the\nconcepts that remain to be classified are: Gas, Cutting Samples and Mud.\n\nThe type Gas has no unity like the concepts Rock, Oil and Water, since all these concepts can\nonly be individualized by other concepts. We considered Gas as a specialization of Substance.\n\n\n\n74\n\nType Name Description Ontology Concept\nLithologyType It enumerates lithology val-\n\nues, such as basalt and\nsand, as well mineral names,\nsuch as dolomite, clay and\nfeldspar.\n\nSubstance, Mineralogy\n\nLithostratigraphyUnit It specifies the unit of lithos-\ntratigraphy: formation, mem-\nber and bed.\n\nGeological Unit\n\nMatrixCementType It enumerates lithology\nmatrix/cement descriptions,\nsuch as dolomite and calcite.\n\nMineralogy\n\nMudClass It defines the class of a\ndrilling fluid, such as water\nbased, oil based and pneu-\nmatic (gas based).\n\nSubstance\n\nMudSubClass It defines mud subtype at\nevent occurrences, such as\nbrackish water, diesel oil-\nbased and natural gas.\n\nSubstance\n\nQualifierType It enumerates values that rep-\nresent the type of qualifier in\nlithology, such as dolomite,\ncalcite, clay and feldspar.\n\nMineralogy\n\nStimFluidSubtype It enumerates fluid sub types,\nsuch as fresh water, oil and\ncarbon dioxide.\n\nSubstance\n\nStimFluidType It enumerates the fluid used\nfor some stage of the stimu-\nlation job, such as gas, oil-\nbased and water-based.\n\nSubstance\n\nWellFluid It enumerates the type of fluid\nbeing produced from or in-\njected into a well facility,\nsuch as gas, oil and water.\n\nSubstance\n\nTable 7.3: The selected WITSML type names and their descriptions.\n\nCuttings Samples are samples of rocks that were extracted from the wellbore during the\ndrilling process. So, this concept offers the identity and unity principles for its instances. Also,\nit is a rigid concept, since its instances cannot fail to be so, unless it ceases to exist. We classify\nit as a specialization of the proposed concept SampleOfRock.\n\nMud is a term that is generally synonymous with drilling fluid and that encompasses most\nfluids used in hydrocarbon drilling operations, especially fluids that contain significant amounts\nof suspended solids (cuttings samples or samples of rocks), emulsified water or oil. Mud has\n\n\n\n75\n\nFigure 7.5: Possible mappings found between WITSML data-objects and Basic Geology ontol-\nogy: LithologyType, MatrixCementType and QualifierType.\n\nFigure 7.6: Possible mappings found between WITSML data-objects and Basic Geology ontol-\nogy: MudClass, MudSubClass and StimFluidSubType.\n\nnot unity and includes all types of water-base, oil-base and synthetic-base drilling fluids, which\nmeans that its instances are the instances of several other rigid concepts which have their own\nidentity. Mud corresponds to the ontological type category (rigid concepts that have not proper\nidentity and group other instances using some property of interest).\n\nThe result of this analysis is presented in the Table 7.4.\n\n\n\n76\n\nFigure 7.7: Possible mappings found between WITSML data-objects and Basic Geology ontol-\nogy: StimFluidType, WellFluid and LithostratigraphyUnit.\n\nType\nOntological Rigidity Relational Unity Ontological\n\nIdentity Dependence Category\nGas O+I+ R+ D- U- Quantity\nMud O-I- R D- U- Mixin\n\nTable 7.4: Ontological analysis of the identified WITSML entities.\n\n7.3.5 RESQML: Step 3\n\nWe analyzed the data types referenced by elements and attributes in RESQML data-object,\nas we did with WITSML data types. We started our analysis by the main classes of data-objects\n(features, interpretations, representations and properties) followed by the data-objects within\nthese classes. For this, we used the \u201cofficial\u201d source for available data-objects: RESQML V2.0\nschema (XSD) files2.\n\nAfter analyzed all available data-objects, we identified that only those related to features\nare really relevant to our work, since this main class groups together the data-objects that have\nphysical existence at some point during the exploration, development, production or abandon-\nment of a reservoir. Between them, we focus our analysis on those that exist in the subsurface\nand are directly involved with the modeling process. We considered both those objects that exist\na priori in the natural world (geological features such as fault and horizon) as well those objects\n\n2Available for download at http://www.energistics.org/reservoir/resqml-standards/current-standards\n\n\n\n77\n\nthat exist by the action of humans (technical features such as well and wellbore). Although\nothers data-objects may have some data related to those analyzed objects and have substantial\ninformation to the modeling process, they flee the scope of this work.\n\nMoreover, it is important to note that the RESQML V2.0 already allows a full integration\nwith the WITSML data-objects. Some of them were already supported by V1.1, such as well,\nwellbore, trajectory, formation marker and well log. In the V2.0, it is also possible to integrate\nWITSML rig-issued well data, such as trajectory and associated raw measurements, and well\nanalysis results stored in other data formats, including PPDM standards. The full integration of\nRESQML V2.0 and WITSML V1.4.1.1 was developed by a Energistics?s SIG sub-group that\nfocused on using the WITSML data model to abstract a simplified WITSML well consisting of\nthree fundamental objects: its trajectory, either in depth and/or in time; a WellboreFrame, which\nis used to reference the WITSML log data; and its extension referring to WITSML marker data.\nThese objects refer WITSML but now exist in the RESQML data model, which allows them to\naccess existing RESQML capabilities [Deny et al. 2013]. Thus, some RESQML data-objects\n(such as well and wellbore) are related to WITSML concepts and were already classified in\nSection 7.3.4 (result presented in the Table 7.4).\n\nWe identified four simple data types (from the file \u201cGeological.xsd\u201d) that enumerate ge-\nological objects with possible mapping with the chosen ontology. A brief description of the\nidentified data types is listed in the Table 7.5. Figures 7.8 and Figure 7.9 provide more details\nabout the possible mapping between the Basic Geology ontology and the involved RESQML\ndata-objects.\n\nFigure 7.8: Possible mappings found between RESQML data-objects and Basic Geology ontol-\nogy: Phase and GeneticBoundaryKind.\n\n\n\n78\n\nType Name Description Ontology Concept\nPhase It describes and enumerates\n\nthe possible rock fluid phase\nunits in a hydrostatic col-\numn (either gases or liquids):\naquifer, gas cap, oil column\nand seal.\n\nSubstance, Geological\nBoundary\n\nGeneticBoundaryKind It describes and enumerates\nthe types of genetic bound-\nary feature: geobody bound-\nary and horizon.\n\nGeological Boundary\n\nTectonicBoundaryKind It describes and enumerates\nthe types of tectonic bound-\naries: fault and fracture.\n\nGeological Boundary,\nGeological Object\n\nFluidContact It describes and enumerates\nvalues used to indicate a spe-\ncific type of fluid boundary\nfeature: free water contact,\ngas oil contact, gas water\ncontact, seal and water oil\ncontact.\n\nGeological Boundary\n\nTable 7.5: The selected RESQML data types and their descriptions.\n\nFigure 7.9: Possible mappings found between RESQML data-objects and Basic Geology ontol-\nogy: TectonicBoundaryKind and FluidContact.\n\n\n\n79\n\n7.3.6 RESQML: Step 4\n\nBetween the identified geological objects, we still have to analyze five of them: seal, hori-\nzon, geobody boundary, fault and fracture. The others were already analyzed previously. How-\never, before performing the ontological analysis of these concepts (according to the properties\nof identity, rigidity, essentiality and unity), it is important to understand the following meanings:\n\n\u2022 Fault: is a break within geological material across which there exists an observable dis-\nplacement (corresponding to the offset of segments or points that were once continuous\nor adjacent). As an object, a fault can be approximated as a very thin tabular volume pos-\nsibly made of brittle rock. Within earth models, faults are frequently represented as mere\nsurfaces or as volumes of zero thickness. Depending on the relative direction of displace-\nment between the rocks and fault blocks, on either side of the fault, the fault movement\nis described as normal, reverse or strike-slip. Thus, we can assert that a fault separates\ndifferent geological units that are not parts of the faults but only neighboring it. However,\neven when an observed geological discontinuity does not separate different geological\nunits, it may still be a fault, since a fault can locally separate rock entities that belong to\none thick unit.\n\n\u2022 Horizon: according to the definition given in the glossary of the book \u201cShared Earth\nModeling\u201d [Perrin and Rainaud 2013], horizon is \u201ca term used for designating either a\nunit boundary or a remarkable bed of small thickness. It can also correspond to a sedi-\nmentary boundary\u201d. A horizon is a discontinuity in the rock volume whose main direction\nis basically horizontal. A horizon may be a surface where seismic waves are reflected and\nthus correspond to a seismic horizon. In this work, we adopt only the second meaning,\nand then a horizon has not substance.\n\nTherefore, it is possible (and essential for geomodeling of geological mapping) to consider\nfaults and horizons as objects, because things that can be observed can materialize both con-\ncepts. Then, we can say that they offer the principle of identity and unity for their instances.\nAlso, both concepts are rigid, since their instances will remain what they are along the whole\nexistence. A fault or a horizon may change its name or its age but there is practically no chance\nthat it changes its nature. A fault will always remain a fault; a horizon will always remain a\nhorizon. The same classification is applied to geobody boundary and fracture.\n\nFinally, the geological object seal is an impermeable volume, which provides a seal that\nprevents the continuation of the upward vertical movement of the oil and gas. We can say that\nbeing a seal is a role played by some rock units under specific conditions. It is possible to\nindividuate a seal and counting it. Moreover, it is necessary to include a rigid type \u2014 litholog-\nical unit \u2014 that guarantees the identity of the instances of seal. The result of this analysis is\npresented in the Table 7.6.\n\n\n\n80\n\nType\nOntological Rigidity Relational Unity Ontological\n\nIdentity Dependence Category\nFault O+I+ R+ D- U+ Kind\nHorizon O+I+ R+ D- U+ Kind\nGeobody boundary O+I+ R+ D- U+ Kind\nFracture O+I+ R+ D- U+ Kind\nSeal O-I+ R- D+ U- Role\n\nTable 7.6: The result of the classification realized with RESQML types.\n\n7.4 Step 5: Performing the mapping\n\nFinally, our last step was performing a mapping between the identified entities from the\nanalyzed standard formats and from the Basic Geology ontology. We illustrate the result of this\nmapping process, emphasizing the identified data-objects from the analyzed standards and the\nmapped entities from the chosen ontology.\n\nThus, Figure 7.10 provides the mappings to entities from Substance sub-ontology. In this\ncase, all analyzed standard data formats have data sets that enumerate concepts mapped to\nentities from the Substance sub-ontology.\n\nFigure 7.10: Possible mappings to entities from Substance sub-ontology.\n\nFigure 7.11 provides the mappings to entities from Geological Unit sub-ontology. In this\ncase, all analyzed standard data formats have data sets that enumerate concepts mapped to\nentities from the Geological Unit sub-ontology. Note that between the concepts enumerated in\nthe data sets Phase and FluidContact, from RESQML standard data format, only the concept\nSeal can be mapped to Lithostratigraphic Unit.\n\n\n\n81\n\nFigure 7.11: Possible mappings to entities from Geological Unit sub-ontology..\n\nFigure 7.12 provides the mappings to entities from Geological Boundary sub-ontology. In\nthis case, only the data set GeneticBoundaryKind, from RESQML standard data format, enu-\nmerates concepts mapped to entities from Geological Boundary sub-ontology.\n\nFigure 7.12: Possible mappings to entities from Geological Boundary sub-ontology.\n\nFinally, Figure 7.13 provides the mappings to entities from Geological Object sub-ontology.\nIn this case, LAS and RESQML standards data formats have data sets that enumerate concepts\nmapped to entities from the Geological Object sub-ontology.\n\n\n\n82\n\nFigure 7.13: Possible mappings to entities from Geological Object sub-ontology.\n\n7.5 Mapping validation and evaluation\n\nIn this section, we will present how the identified mappings were validated and the profiles\nof the professionals that have done that. Furthermore, we also intend to evaluate the possibility\nof automation of the proposed methodological approach by using a formal representational\nlanguage to formalize the mappings between the standards and the chosen ontology.\n\nIn relation to the validation of the identified mappings, we had the honour of the parti-\ncipation of two highly qualified professionals with skills and expertise in ontologies and earth\nmodeling. One of them, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rainaud, is Doctor in Geophysics. He is presently\nSenior Project Manager at Institute Fran\u00e7ais du Petroleum et Energies Nouvelles (IFPEN), in\nFrance, in the field of Information Technology. In the last 15 years, he has become one of\nthe biggest authority in earth modeling systems, which a large set of publications and practical\nprojects. He presently plays a major role in the Energistics RESQML Special Interest Group\n(SIG), which gathers representatives of oil companies and software providers for creating a data\nexchange standard for geomodeling and develop the WITSML, RESQML, PRODML, MICRO\nML standards.\n\nThe other one, Michel Perrin, is Doctor in Geology with extensive experience as a researcher\nin various fields of geology (structural geology, petrology, geochemistry), he dedicated the\nlast twenty last years of professional activity on the subject of geomodeling. He intensely\ncollaborated on this subject with BRGM, IFPEN and with various research groups specialized\nin computer science in France, Switzerland and Brazil, by means of ten joint doctoral works\nand of joint participations in various research projects supported by governmental authorities.\nHis main concern has been developing practical solutions for putting geological knowledge at\n\n\n\n83\n\nthe center of the geomodeling process.\nThey all validate the mappings individually more than three times, emphasizing the clas-\n\nsifications of the identified entities from the analyzed standard data formats and the mappings\nof them to the chosen ontology. Thus, we changed our classifications and mappings of the\nidentified geological concepts many times until we get on the current situation.\n\nIn relation to the evaluation about the possibility of automation of the proposed methodolo-\ngical approach, we ended up that steps 1 and 2 are basically an activity of knowledge acqui-\nsition. Thus, since there are no syntactic aspects in the information about geological concepts\nthat allow the identification of rigid and anti-rigid types, the automation of these steps is not\npossible to achieve in the current state of art.\n\nWe also evaluated that steps 3 and 4 could be automated if the rigid types and their essential\nproperties were previously identified in the analyzed standard data formats. The current limi-\ntation refers to the fact that any mapping would be extremely dependent of syntactic aspects,\nsuch as the necessity of keeping the same name of concepts, the same name of attributes and\ntheir domain values. Thus, considering the present state of art, achieve this goal is still far.\n\nFinally, in order to allow an automatic mapping between the standard data formats and the\nchosen ontology, using inference and reasoning mechanisms, a formal representational lan-\nguage should be used in order to allow the processing of the mappings.\n\n\n\n84\n\n\n\n85\n\n8 CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this work, we presented a methodology for ontological analysis of earth models, aiming\nin providing support for information integration and software interoperability. We founded our\nanalysis in the philosophical background of ontological studies about the nature of the existence\nof being, updated with recent development in Computer Sciences.\n\nOur claim is that the interoperability among earth models built and manipulated by different\nprofessionals and systems can be achieved by making apparent the intended meaning of the\ngeological objects represented in the models. We described the ontological meaning of Geology\nconcepts and relationships previously modeled in the Basic Geology ontology. Our work does\nnot intend to cover the whole Geology domain in proper extension and detail. Thus, the few\nconcepts that have been analyzed are those which are more frequently found in Earth models\nand which are of central importance for anchoring petroleum exploration models into raw data\nand into entities existing in the reality.\n\nWe showed that few ontological properties inhered to concepts - identity, rigidity, essen-\ntiality, dependence and unity - are enough to clarify the meaning of the modeled entities and\nto define the similarities and identities between models and data. These properties elucidate\nwhich are the concepts that are essential to the modeled reality and can be used for providing a\nunified view over this reality. In addition, the understanding of the modeling principles can lead\nto clean the future models of the entities that have no proper existence in reality (i.e., they are\nnot rigid and have no instances). This allows modelers to develop naturally integrable models\nbased on a common framework of the essential rigid concepts.\n\nWe also discussed several misconceptions about relationship meaning commonly found in\nEarth models. From these, the more significant are: the mix of the concepts geological unit (a\ndelimited object in 3D space and time) and rock (the substance of what this object is made),\nthe relation between geological unit and their spatial limits (boundaries, faults) and internal\nstructure (geological structures, sedimentary structures), which are rigid concepts that are in-\nseparable parts of lithological units and not properties of them.\n\nThe approach proposed in this work are a contribution towards a complete semantic inte-\ngration of communication standard formats most used in the reservoir modeling chain. The\nanalysis performed in this study corresponds to an essential step in the integration process.\nClarifying the semantic of the geological concepts most used in petroleum exploration mod-\nels, using a theoretical background of foundational ontologies, assists in solving problems of\nsemantic heterogeneity. Among the several issues related to the integration of communication\nstandard formats most used to exchange information in the earth modeling process, we particu-\nlarly addressed here those related to:\n\n\u2022 Identify and understand the geological concepts most used in petroleum exploration\nmodeling. Firstly, we made an immersion in the literature in order to identify the major\ngaps in information integration and the newest solutions to deal with semantic integration\n\n\n\n86\n\n(ontologies). Then, we analyzed the use of foundational ontologies to deal with semantic\nheterogeneity problems and earth models interoperability. Finally, we studied the reser-\nvoir modeling workflow in order to identify and understand the most used geological\nconcepts.\n\n\u2022 Identify the ontologies developed for Geosciences and earth modeling. We realized a\nsurvey in the literature to discover if the available ontologies for Geosciences and earth\nmodeling have the identified geological concepts.\n\n\u2022 Map the geological concepts to the found ontologies. We exemplified the mapping\ncapability by analyzing the communication standard formats most used in the modeling\nchain (LAS, WITSML and RESQML), searching for entities semantically related with\nthe geological concepts described in those ontologies, in order to make explicit the nature\nand properties of the geological objects found in each format.\n\n\u2022 Classify the geological concepts according to foundational ontologies primitives. We\nclassified the geological concepts found in each format, according to ontological meta-\nproperties (identity, rigidity, essentiality and unity).\n\n8.1 Future Work\n\nThe present work must be considered an approach for elucidate the semantics of the stan-\ndards for data exchange in the earth modeling process. This work has opened various perspec-\ntives concerning what remains to be done in order to develop a complete framework for earth\nmodels integration.\n\nSignificant work remains to be done for studying the ontological properties of all the ob-\njects that have to be considered when building earth models. We have only analyzed some main\nconcepts and properties attached to geological objects leaving apart some other important prop-\nerties (permeability, granulometry, age, etc.). Also, we presented only a subset of the Geology\nconcepts required to model a petroleum prospect. A deeper analysis will be detailed in further\nreports related to our project.\n\nOnce all geological concepts are identified and classified, completing the ontological ana-\nlyzes started in this work, a complete conceptual model can be defined. Then, in order to allow\nan automatic mapping between the standards and the defined conceptual model, using inference\nand reasoning mechanisms, a formal representational language should be used. In this way, the\nmappings may be processed. Languages used to represent mappings between ontologies can be\na source of inspiration for this challenge.\n\nFinally, others standard data formats, such as GeoSciML and NADM, which were briefly\ndiscussed in this analysis, should deserve a deeper study in further studies due their growing\nimportance for geological ontologies.\n\n\n\n87\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[Abel 2001]ABEL, M.
