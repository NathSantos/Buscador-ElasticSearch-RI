O desenvolvimento do trabalho experimental e a participa\u00e7\u00e3o em congressos internacionais foram poss\u00edveis gra\u00e7as ao apoio financeiro das seguintes institui\u00e7\u00f5es: -\tFCT (Bolsa ref SFRH/BD/6607/2001); -\tUniversidade de Aveiro; -\tDepartamento de Biologia da Universidade de Aveiro; -\tCentro de Estudos do Ambiente e do Mar (CESAM) da Universidade de Aveiro.\npalavras-chave\tPeixes, contaminantes ambientais, efeitos fisiol\u00f3gicos, genotoxicidade.\nresumo\tNo presente trabalho foi estudado um largo espectro de efeitos fisiol\u00f3gicos e genot\u00f3xicos induzidos pela exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de tr\u00eas esp\u00e9cies de tele\u00f3steos -Anguilla anguilla L. (enguia Europeia), Dicentrarchus labrax L. (robalo) e Sparus aurata L. (dourada) a contaminantes aqu\u00e1ticos. Exposi\u00e7\u00f5es de curta dura\u00e7\u00e3o foram realizadas de acordo com tr\u00eas (1,2, 3) perspectivas distintas: (1) Exposi\u00e7\u00f5es laboratoriais a contaminantes isolados (cap\u00edtulos II a VI), nomeadamente aos \u00e1cidos abi\u00e9tico e desidroabi\u00e9tico, reteno, naftaleno, 0-naftoflavona (BNF) e 170-estradiol (E2). Estas exposi\u00e7\u00f5es causaram, maioritariamente, uma desregula\u00e7\u00e3o end\u00f3crina, expressa atrav\u00e9s da incapacidade dos peixes elevarem o cortisol no plasma face a situa\u00e7\u00f5es de stresse, exceptuando a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a \u00e1cido abi\u00e9tico que induziu um aumento desta hormona e a BNF que n\u00e3o causou nenhuma altera\u00e7\u00e3o deste par\u00e2metro. Os n\u00edveis plasm\u00e1ticos de glucose e lactato foram determinados como respostas secund\u00e1rias de stresse para todos os compostos anteriormente referidos, excluindo o naftaleno. Os peixes expostos a \u00e1cidos res\u00ednicos apresentaram um aumento dos dois par\u00e2metros anteriores correspondente a um padr\u00e3o de resposta t\u00edpica de stresse. Contudo, o reteno e a BNF induziram aumentos unicamente na concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de glucose plasm\u00e1tica. A exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de A. anguilla a BNF tamb\u00e9m revelou um decr\u00e9scimo da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de tiroxina (T4) no plasma. A capacidade do E2 induzir a s\u00edntese de vitelogenina (Vtg) em D. labrax juvenis e a sua rela\u00e7\u00e3o com os n\u00edveis de E2 no plasma, foram avaliada no cap\u00edtulo VI, adoptando duas vias de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o diferentes: dilui\u00e7\u00e3o na \u00e1gua ou injec\u00e7\u00e3o intraperitoneal (i.p.). A indu\u00e7\u00e3o de Vtg foi verificada nos dois casos, tendo sido detectado um aumento concomitante de E2 no plasma apenas para a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o via \u00e1gua. O naftaleno e a BNF foram capazes de induzir a biotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o hep\u00e1tica, medida atrav\u00e9s do aumento da actividade da etoxiresorufina-O-desetilase (EROD) (fase I) (cap\u00edtulo III). Apesar da capacidade destes compostos induzirem a actividade EROD, eles revelaram uma capacidade inibit\u00f3ria, especialmente para as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es mais elevadas e durante as primeiras horas de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o. O naftaleno revelou ser tamb\u00e9m um indutor da actividade da glutationa-S-transferase (GST) (fase II).\nA resposta genot\u00f3xica de A. anguilla variou claramente com o composto testado. Assim, as propriedades genot\u00f3xicas do naftaleno foram demonstradas atrav\u00e9s de um aumento da frequ\u00eancia de anomalias nucleares eritroc\u00edticas (ANE), enquanto que a BNF n\u00e3o provocou qualquer altera\u00e7\u00e3o deste par\u00e2metro (cap\u00edtulo III). A exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de D. labrax a E2 resultou no aumento da frequ\u00eancia de ANE, demonstrando o seu potencial genot\u00f3xico (cap\u00edtulo V).\nOs compostos testados nos cap\u00edtulos II a VI revelaram uma grande variedade de efeitos adversos, reafirmando o risco ecol\u00f3gico que representam.\n(2)\tExposi\u00e7\u00f5es laboratoriais de D. labrax, A. anguilla e S. aurata a misturas simples ou exposi\u00e7\u00f5es sequenciais a diferentes contaminantes (cap\u00edtulos VII a IX). Os n\u00edveis plasm\u00e1ticos de cortisol e glucose foram quantificados em todos estes cap\u00edtulos. Um decr\u00e9scimo significativo de cortisol foi observado em S. aurata exposta a E2+nonilfenol (NP) (cap\u00edtulo VII), sinalizando uma desregula\u00e7\u00e3o end\u00f3crina. A pr\u00e9-exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a BNF exerceu uma ac\u00e7\u00e3o antagonista sobre a capacidade do cobre (Cu) aumentar o cortisol em A. anguilla (cap\u00edtulo IX). Todas as respostas obtidas revelaram um aumento da glucose, tendo ainda sido verificada uma ac\u00e7\u00e3o sinerg\u00edstica no caso da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de D. labrax a BNF+NP e de A. anguilla a BNF+100 pM cr\u00f3mio (Cr). Contudo, a BNF demonstrou diminuir a capacidade do E2 elevar a glucose plasm\u00e1tica. O lactato plasm\u00e1tico (cap\u00edtulos VIII e IX), de um modo geral, permaneceu inalterado, tendo-se observado um aumento apenas no caso de E2+NP. No entanto, observou-se uma ac\u00e7\u00e3o antagonista da BNF, impedindo o aumento de lactato no plasma de A. anguilla em resultado da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a Cu.\nA frequ\u00eancia de ANE foi avaliada nos cap\u00edtulos VII a IX. A exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de D. labrax a BNF+E2 e a BNF+NP induziu um aumento da frequ\u00eancia de ANE. A exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de A. anguilla a BNF+Cu demonstrou igualmente o seu potencial genot\u00f3xico, revelando uma ac\u00e7\u00e3o sinerg\u00edstica.\nO conte\u00fado hep\u00e1tico em citocromo P450, as actividades EROD, GST e alanina aminotransferase (ALT) no f\u00edgado, bem como o \u00edndice hepato-som\u00e1tico (IHS) foram determinados nos cap\u00edtulos VII e VIII. O E2 e o NP reduziram a actividade de EROD induzida pela BNF em D. labrax. De forma semelhante, a mistura de E2+NP teve a capacidade de afectar a express\u00e3o constitutiva do CYP1A, medida pela diminui\u00e7\u00e3o de EROD em S. aurata. A import\u00e2ncia da mistura de compostos foi refor\u00e7ada atrav\u00e9s da redu\u00e7\u00e3o da actividade de GST observada ap\u00f3s exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a BNF+NP, uma vez que estes compostos isoladamente n\u00e3o demonstraram essa capacidade (cap\u00edtulo VII). Contudo, no cap\u00edtulo VIII, detectou-se um aumento de GST para a mistura E2+NP, possivelmente devido \u00e0 ac\u00e7\u00e3o individual do E2.\nUm decr\u00e9scimo de T4 plasm\u00e1tico foi observado em A. anguilla exposta a BNF+Cr e BNF+Cu, sugerindo uma ac\u00e7\u00e3o sinerg\u00edstica entre BNF e Cu, em que a pr\u00e9-exposi\u00e7\u00e3o acentuou o efeito do Cu (cap\u00edtulo IX). A import\u00e2ncia da pr\u00e9-exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a BNF na ac\u00e7\u00e3o do Cr e do Cu sobre os n\u00edveis T3 plasm\u00e1tico n\u00e3o foi detectada; embora, a interfer\u00eancia dessa pr\u00e9-exposi\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o possa ser exclu\u00edda no caso da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a 100 pM Cr.\n(3)\tA terceira e \u00faltima perspectiva disse respeito a exposi\u00e7\u00f5es in situ em tr\u00eas ecossistemas aqu\u00e1ticos diferentes (cap\u00edtulos X e XI). Estudou-se uma zona portu\u00e1ria, situada na Ria de Aveiro, tipicamente contaminada por hidrocarbonetos arom\u00e1ticos polic\u00edclicos, metais pesados e compostos organoest\u00e2nicos. A zona do rio Vouga situada a 13 Km da sua foz, receptora do efluente de uma unidade de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de pasta de papel durante quase 5 d\u00e9cadas foi tamb\u00e9m estudada. Neste segundo local, foi avaliada a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o do ecossistema ap\u00f3s o desvio do efluente, de acordo com os efeitos observados. Por fim, seleccionou-se um ecossistema de \u00e1gua doce -Pateira de Fermentelos - por ser uma bacia receptora de efluentes dom\u00e9sticos e industriais, bem como de lixiviados agr\u00edcolas. Em qualquer das \u00e1reas de\nestudo foram avaliados indicadores de stresse como cortisol, glucose e lactato plasm\u00e1ticos. Um conjunto de par\u00e2metros relativos \u00e0 biotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o, genotoxicidade, hormonas do eixo hipot\u00e1lamo-pituit\u00e1ria-tir\u00f3ide (HPT) e E2 no plasma foram tamb\u00e9m determinados ap\u00f3s exposi\u00e7\u00e3o na Pateira de Fermentelos (cap\u00edtulo XI). Os indicadores de stresse mostraram altera\u00e7\u00f5es que se enquadram no perfil t\u00edpico de resposta, ou seja aumento simult\u00e2neo de cortisol, glucose e lactato, nos tr\u00eas ecossistemas avaliados, com excep\u00e7\u00e3o do lactato que se manteve inalterado no caso da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o na Pateira de Fermentelos. Os dados relativos ao rio Vouga revelaram altera\u00e7\u00f5es de stresse em A. anguilla, 2 anos ap\u00f3s o desvio do efluente, indicando a persist\u00eancia de contaminantes nos respectivos sedimentos. Na Pateira de Fermentelos observou-se uma tend\u00eancia geral para a diminui\u00e7\u00e3o de T3, confirmada com o decr\u00e9scimo significativo no local mais pr\u00f3ximo da principal fonte de polui\u00e7\u00e3o, sem ser contudo acompanhada por altera\u00e7\u00f5es de TSH e T4. No que diz respeito ao E2, observou-se um aumento significativo em 2 locais da Pateira de Fermentelos, indicando a presen\u00e7a desta hormona \u201cnatural\u201d em n\u00edveis elevados na \u00e1gua. Os par\u00e2metros relativos \u00e0 biotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o e genotoxicidade permaneceram inalterados. Os resultados obtidos nas exposi\u00e7\u00f5es in situ na Pateira de Fermentelos forneceram fortes indica\u00e7\u00f5es da contamina\u00e7\u00e3o deste ecossistema.\nGlobalmente, os dados da presente tese permitem um melhor conhecimento do potencial t\u00f3xico de diferentes compostos de grande relev\u00e2ncia ambiental, cuja import\u00e2ncia surge acrescida pela escassez de informa\u00e7\u00e3o dispon\u00edvel no que respeita aos par\u00e2metros estudados. Os dados apresentados contribu\u00edram tamb\u00e9m para um melhor conhecimento das respostas toxicol\u00f3gicas em peixes, particularmente como resultado do uso de uma bateria de biomarcadores que fornecem evid\u00eancias das interfer\u00eancias de diferentes classes de xenobi\u00f3ticos, quer em misturas, quer em exposi\u00e7\u00f5es sequenciais.\nkeywords\tFish, environmental contaminants, physiological effects, genotoxicity.\nabstract\tIn the present work a wide range of physiological and genotoxic effects due to aquatic contaminants exposure was studied, adopting three teleost species -Anguilla anguilla L. (European eel), Dicentrarchus labrax L. (sea bass) e Sparus aurata L. (sea bream). Short-term exposures were carried out, according to three (1,2, 3) different approaches: (1) Laboratorial exposures to individual compounds (chapters II to VI), namely to abietic and dehydroabietic acids, retene, naphthalene, 0-nahthoflavone (BNF) and 170-estradiol (E2). The large majority of the previous exposures cause endocrine disruption, expressed through fish inability to elevate plasma cortisol under stress conditions, with the exception for abietic acid exposure, which induced an increase in this hormone and BNF that did not cause any alteration. Glucose and lactate plasmatic concentrations were determined, as secondary stress responses, for all the previous mentioned compounds except for naphthalene. Thus, fish exposed to resin acids presented a raise in both parameters corresponding to a typical stress pattern response. Though, retene and BNF only increased the plasma glucose concentration. A. anguilla BNF exposure also revealed a decrease in plasma thyroxine (T4) concentration. In chapter VI, the E2 ability to induce vitellogenin (Vtg) synthesis in juvenile D. labrax was evaluated in relation with E2 levels in plasma, adopting two different exposure routes: water diluted or intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected. A plasma Vtg increase was observed under both exposure conditions, though E2 plasma increase was only significant for waterborne exposure. Naphthalene and BNF demonstrated its ability to induce hepatic biotransformation, measured as an increased ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity (phase I) (chapter III). Despite these compounds EROD activity inducing capacity, it also revealed inhibition ability, especially for the highest concentrations and during the first exposure hours. Naphthalene also revealed its capacity as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) inducer (phase II). A. anguilla genotoxicity response clearly varied with the tested compound. Thus, naphthalene has demonstrated its genotoxic properties by inducing erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA) increase, whereas BNF did not alter this parameter (chapter III). D. labrax E2 exposure induced an increase in ENA frequency, demonstrating its genotoxic potential (chapter V). Globally, the compounds tested in chapters II to VI revealed a wide variety of adverse effects, corroborating the ecological risk they represent.\n(2)\tLaboratorial exposures to simple mixtures or sequential exposures to different contaminants in D. labrax, A. anguilla e S. aurata (chapters VII to IX). In any of the previous chapters, plasma cortisol and glucose levels were assessed. A significant plasma cortisol decrease was observed in S. aurata after E2+nonylphenol (NP) exposure (chapter VII), signalling an endocrine disruption. BNF preexposure exerted an antagonistic action over copper (Cu) ability to induce cortisol increase in A. anguilla (chapter IX). Though all the plasma glucose responses observed revealed an increase, a synergistic action after D. labrax exposure to BNF+NP and A. anguilla exposure to BNF+100 p.M chromium (Cr) was also observed. Nevertheless, BNF showed to limit the E2 capability of elevating plasma glucose. In general, plasma lactate (chapters VIII and IX) remained unaltered, though its increase was observed only after E2+NP exposure. A BNF antagonistic action preventing the plasma lactate increase in A. anguilla due to Cu exposure was detected.\nENA frequency was assessed in the chapters VII to IX. D. labrax exposure to BNF+E2 and BNF+NP induced an ENA frequency increase. A. anguilla exposure to BNF+Cu also demonstrated its genotoxic potential, revealing a synergistic action.\nIn chapters VII and VIII liver cytochrome P450 content, liver EROD, GST and alanine transaminase (ALT) activities, as well as hepato-somatic index (HSI) were measured. E2 and NP reduced the BNF EROD activity induction in D. labrax. The E2+NP mixture had the ability to reduce the constitutive expression of CYP1A, measured as EROD activity in S. aurata. The importance of compound mixtures was supported by the GST activity reduction, observed after exposure to BNF+NP, since each of these compounds isolated does not induce the same effect (chapter VII). Though, in chapter VIII, a GST increase was detected for the mixture E2+NP, probably due to E2 individual action.\nIn chapter IX, an A. anguilla plasma T4 decrease was observed after BNF+Cr and BNF+Cu exposures, suggesting a synergistic action between BNF and Cu since the preexposure enhaced Cu effect. The BNF preexposure over Cr or Cu action on plasma T3 was not observed; though, its importance cannot be excluded considering the 100 nM Cr exposure.\n(3)\tThe third and last approach concerned in situ exposures in three different aquatic ecosystems (chapters X and XI). An offward fishing harbour located at the Ria de Aveiro, typically contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals and organometallics, was studied. An area situated 13 Km upstream from River Vouga mouth was also studied, considering its contamination for several decades as a receptor of a paper and pulp mill effluent. In this second area the contamination cleanup process after the effluent deviation was evaluated, according to the effects observed. Finally, a freshwater ecosystem was also selected - Pateira de Fermentelos - as a recipient of domestic and industrial effluents, agriculture runoff. Stress indicators such as plasma cortisol, glucose and lactate were determined in A. anguilla under exposure. A set of parameters concerning biotransformation, genotoxicity, HPT axis hormones and E2 in plasma was also measured in A. anguilla after exposure at the Pateira de Fermentelos (chapter XI). The simultaneous increase in cortisol, glucose and lactate fit in the typical profile of response to stress indicators in the three evaluated ecosystems, with an exception for plasma lactate that remains unaltered after Pateira de Fermentelos exposure. The data concerning rio Vouga revealed that 2 years after the effluent deviation, contaminants were still able to induce stress alterations in A. anguilla indicating its persistence in the sediments. A general tendency for plasma T3 reduction was observed at the Pateira de Fermentelos and confirmed by its significant decrease at the closest site to the main pollution source. A significant E2 increase was observed in 2 sites of Pateira de Fermentelos, indicating the presence of this natural \u201chormone\u201d in elevated levels in water. The parameters related to biotransformation and genotoxicity remained unaltered. The results concerning A. anguilla Pateira de Fermentelos\nin situ exposure provided strong indication of this ecosystem contamination.\nGlobally, the data concerning the present thesis allow a better knowledge of the toxic potential of different compounds with environmental relevancy. These results also contribute to a better understanding of fish toxicological responses particularly resulting from the use of a biomarker battery that give us the evidence of different classes of xenobiotics interference in mixtures as well as in sequential exposures.\n\u00cdNDICE\n1.\tMeio aqu\u00e1tico e contamina\u00e7\u00e3o......................................... 16\n1.1.\tEtoxilados de alquifen\u00f3is....................................... 19\n1.2.\tHormonas sint\u00e9ticas e \u201cnaturais\u201d................................ 20\n1.3.\tHidrocarbonetos arom\u00e1ticos polic\u00edclicos......................... 21\n1.4.\tMetais pesados.................................................. 23\n1.5.\tMisturas de contaminantes....................................... 25\n2.\tRespostas biol\u00f3gicas a contaminantes................................. 27\n2.1.\tBiotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o................................................ 27\n2.2.\tGenotoxicidade.................................................. 30\n2.3.\tAltera\u00e7\u00f5es end\u00f3crinas........................................... 31\n2.3.1.\tDisfun\u00e7\u00e3o de processos\treprodutivos...................... 33\n2.3.2.\tDisfun\u00e7\u00e3o de processos\tn\u00e3o reprodutivos.................... 35\n2.4.\tRespostas biol\u00f3gicas como indicadores de polui\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental...\t38\n3.\tOrienta\u00e7\u00f5es e objectivos da tese..................................... 40\n4.\tRefer\u00eancias bibliogr\u00e1ficas........................................... 43\nCAP\u00cdTULO II -

A estrutura e conte\u00fado dos artigos cient\u00edficos apresentados foram literalmente respeitados, tendo sido, contudo, adaptada a sua formata\u00e7\u00e3o de acordo com as normas da Universidade de Aveiro que regulamentam este aspecto.\nA terceira e \u00faltima parte (Cap\u00edtulo XII) corresponde a uma Discuss\u00e3o Geral relativa aos dez cap\u00edtulos precedentes, numa perspectiva global e integradora.\nCAP\u00cdTULO I\nIntrodu\u00e7\u00e3o geral\n1.\tMEIO AQU\u00c1TICO E CONTAMINA\u00c7\u00c3O\nO ambiente aqu\u00e1tico tem vindo a ser progressivamente afectado pelas actividades antropog\u00e9nicas resultando, fundamentalmente, da quantidade e variedade de poluentes que nele s\u00e3o regularmente introduzidos de forma intencional ou acidental. As actividades industriais e agr\u00edcolas, assim como os aglomerados urbanos s\u00e3o os principais contribuintes para o agravamento da sa\u00fade ambiental e consequentemente da qualidade da \u00e1gua. Recentemente, tem-se vindo a reconhecer tamb\u00e9m o risco que representam alguns compostos naturais, de que s\u00e3o exemplo as hormonas ester\u00f3ides, quando presentes em elevadas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es no meio aqu\u00e1tico. Os ecossistemas aqu\u00e1ticos constituem o destino final da maior parte dos res\u00edduos provenientes dessas actividades, sendo as zonas costeiras particularmente afectadas uma vez que, de um modo geral, oferecem boas condi\u00e7\u00f5es para a implanta\u00e7\u00e3o de ind\u00fastrias e centros urbanos importantes.\nA gest\u00e3o, protec\u00e7\u00e3o e conserva\u00e7\u00e3o efectiva dos ecossistemas aqu\u00e1ticos obriga a uma monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o regular, sustentada n\u00e3o s\u00f3 pela quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos compostos qu\u00edmicos na \u00e1gua, sedimento e biota, mas tamb\u00e9m pela utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de um leque adequado de respostas biol\u00f3gicas (biomarcadores). Estas respostas podem incluir altera\u00e7\u00f5es a n\u00edvel bioqu\u00edmico, fisiol\u00f3gico, celular, morfol\u00f3gico ou comportamental, permitindo assim um melhor conhecimento dos processos biol\u00f3gicos associados \u00e0 ac\u00e7\u00e3o dos contaminantes. Deste modo, o presente trabalho analisou os efeitos induzidos em peixes por contaminantes do meio aqu\u00e1tico, em diferentes n\u00edveis biol\u00f3gicos, nomeadamente bioqu\u00edmico, fisiol\u00f3gico e citogen\u00e9tico. As altera\u00e7\u00f5es a n\u00edvel biomolecular podem ser interpretadas como um aviso pr\u00e9vio, oferecendo a possibilidade de antecipar uma interven\u00e7\u00e3o relativamente \u00e0 ocorr\u00eancia de dist\u00farbios importantes a n\u00edvel do indiv\u00edduo ou a n\u00edveis organizacionais mais elevados.\nOs xenobi\u00f3ticos ap\u00f3s absor\u00e7\u00e3o, s\u00e3o submetidos a uma s\u00e9rie de reac\u00e7\u00f5es que podem conduzir sequencialmente \u00e0 sua activa\u00e7\u00e3o, desintoxica\u00e7\u00e3o e excre\u00e7\u00e3o. Estes processos v\u00e3o determinar a sua taxa de elimina\u00e7\u00e3o e consequentemente a sua toxicidade e potencial de bioacumula\u00e7\u00e3o. Os processos de desintoxica\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00eam\ngrande import\u00e2ncia na toxicocin\u00e9tica dos xenobi\u00f3ticos, pelo que o presente trabalho abordou a modula\u00e7\u00e3o do metabolismo de biotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o de fase I e fase II em resposta a exposi\u00e7\u00f5es a contaminantes ambientais. Efeitos a n\u00edvel do sistema end\u00f3crino foram tamb\u00e9m estudados, dada a sua import\u00e2ncia na homeostasia. Tendo em considera\u00e7\u00e3o que a integridade do material gen\u00e9tico \u00e9 essencial ao funcionamento das c\u00e9lulas e dos organismos foram ainda investigados efeitos a n\u00edvel citogen\u00e9tico.\nA maioria dos compostos qu\u00edmicos testados no presente trabalho de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o foram seleccionados tendo em considera\u00e7\u00e3o o facto de serem contaminantes ambientais e representarem risco potencial para os organismos aqu\u00e1ticos. Estes compostos integram as principais classes de contaminantes do meio aqu\u00e1tico e apresentam uma grande relev\u00e2ncia a n\u00edvel regional, nomeadamente no que respeita \u00e0 contamina\u00e7\u00e3o dos ecossistemas Ria de Aveiro e Pateira de Fermentelos. Adicionalmente, foram realizadas experi\u00eancias in situ nos referidos ecossistemas, de forma a permitir o estudo de respostas perante situa\u00e7\u00f5es reais de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o, em particular no que respeita \u00e0 ac\u00e7\u00e3o de misturas complexas.\nA Ria de Aveiro \u00e9 uma laguna situada na regi\u00e3o centro de Portugal (40\u00b038\u2019N, 8\u00b045\u2019W), com 45 km de comprimento e 10 km de largura, abrangendo uma \u00e1rea de 83 km2 em preia-mar e 66 km2 em baixa-mar (Dias e Lopes, 2006), representando um importante ecossistema do qual depende directamente uma consider\u00e1vel actividade piscat\u00f3ria e indirectamente actividades diversas como a ind\u00fastria, turismo e tr\u00e1fego naval. Assim, a contamina\u00e7\u00e3o da Ria de Aveiro resulta de uma enorme variedade de fontes antropog\u00e9nicas em que se incluem efluentes industriais de diferente natureza, efluentes urbanos, res\u00edduos da actividade portu\u00e1ria, bem como lixiviados agr\u00edcolas. Uma vez que a partir de 1999 se iniciou um processo de desvio destes efluentes atrav\u00e9s de um exutor submarino para o oceano Atl\u00e2ntico, \u00e9 previs\u00edvel que se venha a assistir a uma melhoria consider\u00e1vel na qualidade deste ecossistema. No entanto, a biomonitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o regular dos principais pontos cr\u00edticos da Ria de Aveiro, constitui uma necessidade dada a ocorr\u00eancia de descargas, assim como a persist\u00eancia de alguns dos contaminantes.\nO rio Vouga \u00e9 o principal fonecedor de \u00e1gua doce da Ria de Aveiro, sendo o seu tro\u00e7o final caracterizado por uma consider\u00e1vel carga poluente resultante, principalmente, de descargas da ind\u00fastria de pasta de papel de que foi receptor durante cinco d\u00e9cadas. No entanto, a zona que foi alvo de estudo, a juzante do rio Vouga, \u00e9 condicionada pela ac\u00e7\u00e3o das mar\u00e9s que a\u00ed se fazem sentir, transformando-se quase numa extens\u00e3o da Ria de Aveiro.\nA Pateira de Fermentelos \u00e9 um ecossistema natural de \u00e1gua doce localizado na regi\u00e3o centro de Portugal, com uma \u00e1rea total de 5 km2. Esta massa de \u00e1gua \u00e9 considerada uma expans\u00e3o do rio C\u00e9rtima e o principal afluente do rio \u00c1gueda. Durante as \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas a qualidade da \u00e1gua na Pateira de Fermentelos tem vindo a decrescer devido ao aumento de descargas de efluentes dom\u00e9sticos, industriais e agr\u00edcolas. Apesar dos estudos realizados por Calado et al. (1991) e Almeida (1998) n\u00e3o existe refer\u00eancia a estudos relativos a efeitos de contaminantes sobre a ictiofauna.\nOs peixes representam o grupo de Vertebrados mais antigo e diversificado, compreendendo a maior percentagem de esp\u00e9cies deste subfilo e ocupando um extraordin\u00e1rio leque de habitats tais como oceanos, mares, rios, lagos e fontes hidrotermais (Bolis et al., 2001). Devido aos diferentes tipos de habitats que ocupam, os peixes t\u00eam desenvolvido diferentes estrat\u00e9gias de sobreviv\u00eancia, tornando-os particularmente \u00fateis em estudos de ecotoxicologia, permitindo avaliar os efeitos de uma vasta gama de contaminantes sob um largo espectro de condi\u00e7\u00f5es de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o. Os peixes t\u00eam sido eleitos como modelos biol\u00f3gicos preferenciais para a compreens\u00e3o dos fundamentos de \u00e1reas t\u00e3o diversas como a ecotoxicologia, gen\u00e9tica, oncologia, biomedicina, neurobiologia, endocrinologia, aquacultura e de uma forma geral, como uma ferramenta que permite obter informa\u00e7\u00e3o b\u00e1sica para outras ci\u00eancias biol\u00f3gicas (Bolis et al., 2001). Assim, no desenvolvimento do presente trabalho cient\u00edfico as esp\u00e9cies Anguilla anguilla L. (enguia Europeia), Dicentrarchus labrax L. (robalo) e Sparus aurata L. (dourada) foram seleccionadas como bioindicadores, por serem representativas da ictiofauna local, pelas suas caracter\u00edsticas biol\u00f3gicas e elevado valor comercial, ocupando um lugar de destaque\nna pesca e piscicultura. A. anguilla apesar da sua resist\u00eancia, tem demonstrado grande sensibilidade no que respeita \u00e0 detec\u00e7\u00e3o da presen\u00e7a de contaminantes na \u00e1gua e sedimentos, acrescida da possibilidade de poderem ser expostas em \u00e1gua salgada e/ou salobra o que \u00e9 particularmente importante no \u00e2mbito de estudos de ecotoxicologia estuarina (Santos e Pacheco, 1995, 1996; Pacheco e Santos, 2001a, b; Maria et al., 2004; Santos et al., 2004; Ahmad et al., 2005). D. labrax possui tamb\u00e9m grande sensibilidade \u00e0 presen\u00e7a de xenobi\u00f3ticos (Gravato e Santos, 2002a, b, c; 2003) apesar da sua menor resist\u00eancia. S. aurata foi tamb\u00e9m seleccionada devido ao facto de, apesar de fazer parte da ictiofauna da Ria de Aveiro, pouco ou nada se saber no que respeita aos efeitos induzidos pelos contaminantes xenobi\u00f3ticos presentes na respectiva \u00e1gua.\n1.1.\tEtoxilados de alquilfen\u00f3is\nOs etoxilados de alquilfen\u00f3is s\u00e3o surfactantes n\u00e3o i\u00f3nicos largamente utilizados nas ind\u00fastrias farmac\u00eautica, cosm\u00e9tica, t\u00eaxtil, de pl\u00e1sticos, detergentes e pasta de papel, estimando-se uma produ\u00e7\u00e3o anual mundial de 665.000 toneladas (Hager, 1998). Neste contexto, os compostos mais relevantes s\u00e3o os etoxilados de octilfenol e nonilfenol, correspondendo os \u00faltimos a cerca de 80 % do consumo mundial (Renner, 1997). A degrada\u00e7\u00e3o destes compostos conduz \u00e0 forma\u00e7\u00e3o de v\u00e1rios metabolitos, sendo o 4-nonilfenol (NP) identificado como o mais cr\u00edtico devido \u00e0 sua lipofilicidade, toxicidade e relativa resist\u00eancia \u00e0 biodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o (Ying, 2005). O NP foi detectado em ecossistemas aqu\u00e1ticos polu\u00eddos em valores na ordem dos p.g/L, sendo o n\u00edvel mais elevado de 600 p.g/L (Sol\u00e9 et al., 2000). A degrada\u00e7\u00e3o abi\u00f3tica do NP \u00e9 pouco significativa e a sua biodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o moderada, sendo o seu tempo de meia-vida de aproximadamente 30 dias, em \u00e1guas superficiais sob condi\u00e7\u00f5es aer\u00f3bias (EU-RAR, 1998). O NP demonstrou ser bioacumulado em peixes, devido \u00e0 sua lipofilicidade (Ying, 2005), e excretado predominantemente ap\u00f3s conjuga\u00e7\u00e3o com o \u00e1cido glucor\u00f3nico (Arukwe et al., 2000a). O NP demonstrou ser estrog\u00e9nico em peixes, induzindo intersexualidade (Balch e Metcalfe, 2005),\n1.2.\tHormonas sint\u00e9ticas e \u201cnaturais\u201d\nAs hormonas de s\u00edntese s\u00e3o subst\u00e2ncias produzidas com a inten\u00e7\u00e3o de modular o sistema end\u00f3crino, incluindo compostos com estrutura id\u00eantica \u00e0s hormonas \u201cnaturais\u201d, de que s\u00e3o exemplo os contraceptivos orais, f\u00e1rmacos aplicados em terapias hormonais de substitui\u00e7\u00e3o e alguns aditivos alimentares usados em produ\u00e7\u00e3o animal. Assim, estes compostos atingem o ambiente aqu\u00e1tico atrav\u00e9s dos esgotos dom\u00e9sticos, bem como da ind\u00fastria e pecu\u00e1ria. O etinilestradiol, em particular, \u00e9 um estrog\u00e9nio sint\u00e9tico usado nos contraceptivos orais, sendo considerado um potente desregulador end\u00f3crino em peixes (Van den Belt et al.,\n2004). Este composto \u00e9 excretado pelas mulheres na sua forma conjugada e portanto inactiva, podendo, no entanto, ser desconjugado no ambiente por ac\u00e7\u00e3o bacteriana. Desta forma o etinilestradiol pode ser reactivado, pelo que \u00e9 frequentemente encontrado em ambientes aqu\u00e1ticos polu\u00eddos (Van den Belt et al.,\n2004).\nAlgumas hormonas \u201cnaturais\u201c, de que s\u00e3o exemplo o 170-estradiol (E2) e alguns fitoestrog\u00e9nios, podem ser encontradas no ambiente aqu\u00e1tico em concentra\u00e7\u00f5es anormalmente elevadas, o que aliado \u00e0 sua capacidade de causar altera\u00e7\u00f5es end\u00f3crinas nos organismos, levou a que fossem consideradas como contaminantes ambientais. O E2, em particular, chega ao meio aqu\u00e1tico principalmente atrav\u00e9s de efluentes dom\u00e9sticos, tendo sido estimada uma excre\u00e7\u00e3o di\u00e1ria de 2,3 a 259 pg/mulher e 1,6 pg/homem (Johnson et al., 2000). Outras duas importantes fontes de E2 s\u00e3o os efluentes de produ\u00e7\u00e3o animal (Ying et al., 2002) e a lixivia\u00e7\u00e3o dos solos agr\u00edcolas (C\u00e9spedes et al., 2004). Nichols et al. (1998) mediu em\nlixiviados de um campo de pastor\u00edcia 3500 ng/L de E2. Durante as \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas, tem-se verificado um aumento significativo das concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de E2 no meio aqu\u00e1tico, principalmente em zonas urbanas, sendo os seus n\u00edveis na \u00e1gua na ordem das ng/L, podendo atingir 200 ng/L (Bowman et al., 2000). O E2 na \u00e1gua, sob condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais aer\u00f3bias, \u00e9 rapidamente biodegradado tendo sido determinado um tempo de meia-vida de 2 dias (Ying et al., 2003). A biotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o do E2 em peixes \u00e9 realizada pelas enzimas de fase I e de fase II (conjuga\u00e7\u00e3o maioritariamente com \u00e1cido glucur\u00f3nico), sendo a excre\u00e7\u00e3o atrav\u00e9s da b\u00edlis e da urina. Os conjugados resultantes da fase II da biotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o do E2 podem sofrer desconjuga\u00e7\u00e3o no ambiente por ac\u00e7\u00e3o bacteriana, levando ao seu reaparecimento como hormona livre (activa) e podendo desta forma ser absorvida pela fauna pisc\u00edcola (Baronti et al.,\n2000)\t. O E2 pode tamb\u00e9m ser excretado, em menor percentagem, na sua forma livre (Lange et al., 2002). Os estudos relativos aos efeitos adversos do E2 em peixes s\u00e3o, maioritariamente, direccionados para aspectos da biologia da reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o. A exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de peixes a E2 induz a vitelog\u00e9nese em machos e juvenis (Vaccaro et al., 2005; Soverchia et al., 2005), redu\u00e7\u00e3o do \u00edndice gonado-som\u00e1tico (Bjerselius et al.,\n2001)\t, inibi\u00e7\u00e3o do crescimento testicular (Panter et al., 1998), decr\u00e9scimo da produ\u00e7\u00e3o de ovos (Imai et al., 2005) e feminiza\u00e7\u00e3o de machos (Hirai et al., 2005). Existe ainda uma ampla evid\u00eancia de que esta hormona pode afectar aspectos n\u00e3o reprodutivos, alterando nomeadamente a biotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o de xenobi\u00f3ticos (Vaccaro et al., 2005) e os n\u00edveis plasm\u00e1ticos de hormonas n\u00e3o sexuais (McCormick et al.,\n2005).\n1.3.\tHidrocarbonetos arom\u00e1ticos polic\u00edclicos\nOs hidrocarbonetos arom\u00e1ticos constituem um grupo de compostos qu\u00edmicos que apresentam uma configura\u00e7\u00e3o baseada na presen\u00e7a do anel arom\u00e1tico benzeno; assim, dois ou mais an\u00e9is arom\u00e1ticos fundidos constituem os chamados hidrocarbonetos arom\u00e1ticos polic\u00edclicos (HAP). As erup\u00e7\u00f5es vulc\u00e2nicas e os inc\u00eandios florestais s\u00e3o as principais fontes naturais de HAP. No entanto, os valores\nde HAP encontrados no ambiente aqu\u00e1tico s\u00e3o marcadamente afectados por emiss\u00f5es antropog\u00e9nicas, resultando nomeadamente de processos de incinera\u00e7\u00e3o, derrames de combust\u00edveis f\u00f3sseis, assim como de efluentes industriais e dom\u00e9sticos. Os HAP s\u00e3o compostos ub\u00edquos, estimando-se que sejam libertadas anualmente para o meio aqu\u00e1tico cerca de 230.000 toneladas (Eisler, 1987). Os processos que mais contribuem para a sua degrada\u00e7\u00e3o na \u00e1gua s\u00e3o a fotooxida\u00e7\u00e3o, oxida\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica e biodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o por microorganismos. Contudo, s\u00e3o compostos est\u00e1veis que pela sua natureza lipof\u00edlica podem atravessar facilmente as membranas biol\u00f3gicas, sendo na maioria dos casos rapidamente metabolizados e excretados pelos peixes. A relativa insolubilidade dos HAP na \u00e1gua e a sua forte capacidade de adsor\u00e7\u00e3o a part\u00edculas faz com que se acumulem facilmente nos sedimentos (Seruto et al., 2005). As concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de HAP encontradas na \u00e1gua de locais contaminados atingem os 100 p.g/L (Kennicutt et al., 1991; Zhou e Maskaoui, 2003; Gonz\u00e1lez et al.,\n2005). A contamina\u00e7\u00e3o por este tipo de compostos constitui uma preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o generalizada devido \u00e0 sua persist\u00eancia no ambiente e potencial mutag\u00e9nico e cancer\u00edgeno j\u00e1 demonstrado em peixes (Baumann, 1998; Gravato et al., 2002a; Pacheco e Santos, 2002a; Maria etal., 2002; Busetti etal., 2006).\nO naftaleno \u00e9 o HAP mais simples, constitu\u00eddo apenas por dois an\u00e9is benz\u00e9nicos, cuja introdu\u00e7\u00e3o no ambiente aqu\u00e1tico est\u00e1 predominantemente relacionada com a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de repelentes anti-insectos e derrames de derivados de petr\u00f3leo provenientes de refinarias e petroleiros. Desta forma, o naftaleno est\u00e1 amplamente distribu\u00eddo no meio aqu\u00e1tico onde pode atingir a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de 66 mg/L (ATSDR, 1995), tendo sido inclu\u00eddo na lista de poluentes priorit\u00e1rios elaborada pela U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, 1988). O naftaleno \u00e9 considerado o HAP mais hidrosol\u00favel, ligando-se fracamente aos sedimentos, podendo sofrer ac\u00e7\u00e3o bacteriana ou evapora\u00e7\u00e3o e desaparecer em 2 semanas. Os peixes absorvem o naftaleno contido na \u00e1gua o qual \u00e9 sujeito \u00e0 fase I da biotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o e posterior conjuga\u00e7\u00e3o com glutationa, \u00e1cido glucor\u00f3nico ou sulfato activados, sendo excretado na urina e b\u00edlis. Este HAP, de uma forma geral, n\u00e3o se bioacumula, sendo encontrado em n\u00edveis muito baixos nos tecidos de peixes que habitam locais polu\u00eddos (ATSDR,\n1.4.\tMetais pesados\nOs metais pesados que ocorrem no ambiente podem ter origem natural, resultando principalmente da eros\u00e3o f\u00edsica, qu\u00edmica e biol\u00f3gica das rochas, ou antropog\u00e9nica como consequ\u00eancia da actividade agr\u00edcola, mineira, industrial, assim como da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de combust\u00edveis f\u00f3sseis. V\u00e1rios metais pesados est\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m inclu\u00eddos na lista de poluentes priorit\u00e1rios da EPA (2004) devido \u00e0 sua abund\u00e2ncia, persist\u00eancia e toxicidade. No meio aqu\u00e1tico, os metais pesados podem encontrar-se dissolvidos na \u00e1gua sob a forma i\u00f3nica, associados a uma s\u00e9rie de ligandos ou adsorvidos a part\u00edculas em suspens\u00e3o e sedimentos. O comportamento e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos metais pesados no ambiente aqu\u00e1tico s\u00e3o influenciados por v\u00e1rios factores, tais como pH, oxig\u00e9nio dissolvido, temperatura, salinidade, presen\u00e7a de agentes oxidantes e quelantes, bem como o conte\u00fado em mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica, afectando a sua biodisponibilidade.\nA capacidade de excre\u00e7\u00e3o de metais pesados pelos peixes poder\u00e1 aumentar sempre que estes absorvam quantidades que excedam as suas necessidades fisiol\u00f3gicas, de modo a manter a homeostase interna. A excre\u00e7\u00e3o desses metais pode ocorrer atrav\u00e9s das br\u00e2nquias, b\u00edlis e urina. No entanto, acima de um determinado limite a capacidade de excre\u00e7\u00e3o esgota-se e os metais pesados podem ser sequestrados por prote\u00ednas intracelulares, tais como as metalotioninas (Langston et al., 2002), ou incorporados em gr\u00e2nulos (Wallace et al., 2003), limitando assim a sua biodisponibilidade.\nA bioacumula\u00e7\u00e3o dos metais pesados nos peixes depende da via de absor\u00e7\u00e3o, encontrando-se n\u00edveis elevados nas br\u00e2nquias no per\u00edodo inicial de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o via \u00e1gua, enquanto que o sistema digestivo, f\u00edgado e rim acumulam\nApesar de alguns metais pesados, tais como o cobre (Cu) e o cr\u00f3mio (Cr), serem essenciais para diversos processos fisiol\u00f3gicos, quando ocorrem no ambiente em concentra\u00e7\u00f5es elevadas podem tornar-se t\u00f3xicos para os organismos. O Cu pode atingir facilmente o ambiente aqu\u00e1tico dada a sua extensa e variada utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o em in\u00fameros contextos tal como na ind\u00fastria de galvaniza\u00e7\u00e3o, refinarias de petr\u00f3leo, incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o em canaliza\u00e7\u00f5es e utens\u00edlios dom\u00e9sticos, assim como em fertilizantes, pesticidas e alimentos para animais. Assim, o Cu pode ser encontrado em \u00e1guas superficiais em concentra\u00e7\u00f5es at\u00e9 1 mg/L (ATSDR, 2002). A exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de peixes a Cu pode causar imunosupress\u00e3o (Shariff et al., 2001), stresse oxidativo (Ahmad et al., 2005), altera\u00e7\u00f5es hormonais (Flik et al., 2002) e do metabolismo dos hidratos de carbono (Dhanapakiam e Ramasamy, 2001), altera\u00e7\u00f5es hematol\u00f3gicas (Carvalho e Fernandes, 2006) e morfol\u00f3gicas (De Boeck et al., 2003), bem como redu\u00e7\u00e3o do crescimento (Levesque et al., 2002).\nO Cr \u00e9 um metal abundante na Crosta terrestre, podendo ser encontrado na forma trivalente [Cr (III)] ou hexavalente [Cr (VI)]. Esta \u00faltima \u00e9 considerada a forma mais t\u00f3xica do Cr, dado que atravessa facilmente as membranas biol\u00f3gicas. O Cr (VI) uma vez dentro da c\u00e9lula, \u00e9 reduzido a Cr (III), o qual pode complexar-se com macromol\u00e9culas, incluindo o \u00e1cido desoxirribonucleico (ADN) (Farag et al., 2005). A actividade industrial \u00e9 a principal respons\u00e1vel pela emiss\u00e3o de importantes quantidades de Cr para o ambiente aqu\u00e1tico, em especial a ind\u00fastria t\u00eaxtil, sider\u00fargica, metal\u00fargica, de cromagem, galvaniza\u00e7\u00e3o e produ\u00e7\u00e3o de a\u00e7o inoxid\u00e1vel. Os efluentes dom\u00e9sticos e de curtumes assumem ainda particular relevo, assim como lixiviados de solos agr\u00edcolas tratados com fertilizantes contendo Cr. Assim, este metal pode ser encontrado no ambiente aqu\u00e1tico em concentra\u00e7\u00f5es at\u00e9 110 p.g/L (Pekey et al., 2004). A exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de peixes a Cr pode causar altera\u00e7\u00f5es no\n1.5.\tMisturas de contaminantes\nOs contaminantes raramente ocorrem individualmente no ambiente, estando os organismos aqu\u00e1ticos, de um modo geral, expostos a misturas mais ou menos complexas de poluentes. A ocorr\u00eancia de interac\u00e7\u00f5es toxicol\u00f3gicas entre contaminantes introduz deste modo uma dificuldade adicional na previs\u00e3o dos seus efeitos. Um exemplo t\u00edpico de interac\u00e7\u00e3o entre compostos qu\u00edmicos \u00e9 aquela que decorre da presen\u00e7a simult\u00e2nea de indutores e inibidores da actividade do CYP1A, como s\u00e3o respectivamente os HAP e metais pesados. Estudos pr\u00e9vios demonstraram redu\u00e7\u00e3o da actividade de etoxiresorufina-O-desetilase (EROD) em peixes expostos simult\u00e2nea ou sequencialmente a estas duas classes de compostos (Viarengo et al., 1997; Sorrentino et al., 2005). N\u00edveis anormalmente baixos de actividade EROD foram tamb\u00e9m observados em peixes colhidos em locais polu\u00eddos por hidrocarbonetos e que apresentavam elevada concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de metais pesados nos tecidos (Romeo et al., 1994). Uma interac\u00e7\u00e3o semelhante ocorre entre indutores da actividade de EROD e etoxilados de alquifen\u00f3is (Vaccaro et al., 2005). Em ambos os exemplos referidos, os baixos n\u00edveis da actividade de EROD dever\u00e3o ser interpretados n\u00e3o como resultado da aus\u00eancia de compostos indutores, mas antes como uma impossibilidade de expressar a ac\u00e7\u00e3o dos indutores pela presen\u00e7a de inibidores.\nUma interac\u00e7\u00e3o toxicol\u00f3gica ocorre quando a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a dois ou mais compostos qu\u00edmicos resulta numa resposta biol\u00f3gica quantitativa e qualitativamente diferente daquela que seria de esperar pela soma da ac\u00e7\u00e3o individual de cada composto. Estas interac\u00e7\u00f5es podem configurar situa\u00e7\u00f5es de sinergismo, potencia\u00e7\u00e3o ou antagonismo (Connell et al., 1999). O sinergismo e a potencia\u00e7\u00e3o referem-se a situa\u00e7\u00f5es em que o efeito t\u00f3xico da mistura \u00e9 superior ao da soma dos efeitos dos\ncompostos qu\u00edmicos separadamente. Na potencia\u00e7\u00e3o, assume-se que um dos compostos, individualmente, tem pouca ou nenhuma toxicidade, enquanto que no sinergismo, ambos os compostos apresentam j\u00e1 toxicidade consider\u00e1vel individualmente. Por outro lado, o antagonismo refere-se \u00e0 situa\u00e7\u00e3o em que a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o simult\u00e2nea ou sequencial a dois ou mais compostos qu\u00edmicos, resulta num efeito menor que o esperado se a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o fosse feita separadamente. Assim, predizer o impacto de misturas de compostos qu\u00edmicos com base no conhecimento dos efeitos individuais de cada composto pode n\u00e3o reflectir o que realmente se passa no organismo, tornando-se pois indispens\u00e1vel o conhecimento pr\u00e1tico das respectivas interac\u00e7\u00f5es.\nA ocorr\u00eancia de misturas de contaminantes no ambiente pode ser o resultado quer da emiss\u00e3o de efluentes por si s\u00f3 complexos, quer de diferentes descargas com origem e composi\u00e7\u00e3o diversas. Os sistemas lagunares, costeiros ou de \u00e1guas interiores, pelas suas caracter\u00edsticas hidrol\u00f3gicas, assim como pela concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de aglomerados urbanos e unidades industriais na sua periferia, s\u00e3o ecossistemas que tipicamente exibem situa\u00e7\u00f5es de multi-contamina\u00e7\u00e3o, resultantes dos dois cen\u00e1rios anteriormente descritos.\nUm exemplo de efluente de enorme complexidade \u00e9 o que resulta da ind\u00fastria de pasta de papel. Os efluentes da pasta de papel (EPP) s\u00e3o constitu\u00eddos por mais de 300 compostos distribu\u00eddos por diferentes classes, tais como os \u00e1cidos res\u00ednicos (AR), \u00e1cidos gordos, clorofen\u00f3is, dioxinas e furanos clorados, cloroguaicois e clorocatecois. Estes efluentes demonstraram ser respons\u00e1veis por efeitos adversos em peixes, nomeadamente altera\u00e7\u00f5es no metabolismo dos hidratos de carbono (Santos e Pacheco, 1996; Landman et al., 2005), dist\u00farbios hormonais (Santos e Pacheco, 1996; Sep\u00falveda et al., 2001), indu\u00e7\u00e3o de enzimas de biotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o (Larsson et al., 2002), stresse oxidativo (Santos et al., 2004; Oakes et al., 2004) e vitelog\u00e9nese (Sep\u00falveda et al., 2001), genotoxicidade (Ericson e Larsson, 2000; Maria et al., 2004) e imunosupress\u00e3o (Aaltonen et al., 2000), bem como altera\u00e7\u00f5es histopatol\u00f3gicas (Couillard et al., 1999; Pacheco e Santos, 2002b).\n2.\tRESPOSTAS BIOL\u00d3GICAS A CONTAMINANTES\nNo contexto da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a contaminantes, o termo \"resposta biol\u00f3gica\" refere-se ao conjunto de reac\u00e7\u00f5es de um organismo no sentido da manuten\u00e7\u00e3o da homeostase, assim como a altera\u00e7\u00f5es mais severas, n\u00e3o inclu\u00eddas nos processos anteriormente referidos os quais representam desequil\u00edbrios, que configuram situa\u00e7\u00f5es de toxicidade. As respostas biol\u00f3gicas, a n\u00edvel molecular e bioqu\u00edmico, resultantes da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a contaminantes, quando n\u00e3o devidamente compensadas por homeostasia, poder\u00e3o expressar-se a n\u00edveis superiores de um modo progressivo resultando, por exemplo, em altera\u00e7\u00f5es que afectam a reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o, o crescimento e o comportamento. Estas altera\u00e7\u00f5es poder\u00e3o afectar, em \u00faltima an\u00e1lise, a sobreviv\u00eancia dos organismos levando ao decl\u00ednio de popula\u00e7\u00f5es, comunidades e ecossistemas. As respostas biol\u00f3gicas a n\u00edvel biomolecular e/ou bioqu\u00edmico s\u00e3o indica\u00e7\u00f5es precoces de situa\u00e7\u00f5es de stresse, podendo ser utilizadas como um sistema de alerta que permita prever e evitar efeitos t\u00f3xicos significativos. Assim, um vasto leque de respostas biol\u00f3gicas, a diversos tipos de contaminantes do meio aqu\u00e1tico, tem sido estudado em peixes, pelo que se segue nos pontos seguintes uma s\u00edntese daquelas que foram alvo de estudo na presente tese.\n2.1.\tBiotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o\nNo meio aqu\u00e1tico, o contacto permanente dos peixes com a \u00e1gua promove a absor\u00e7\u00e3o directa de contaminantes a partir desta ou do sedimento, atrav\u00e9s dos sistemas respirat\u00f3rio (via br\u00e2nquias) e, em menor grau, atrav\u00e9s da pele. A absor\u00e7\u00e3o pode igualmente ter lugar atrav\u00e9s do sistema digestivo por via alimentar. A distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos contaminantes pelos tecidos ap\u00f3s absor\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 influenciada por v\u00e1rios processos fisiol\u00f3gicos e pelas propriedades qu\u00edmicas dos mesmos, tais como a lipofilicidade e a sua capacidade de liga\u00e7\u00e3o a macromol\u00e9culas. Os compostos qu\u00edmicos, aquando da sua elimina\u00e7\u00e3o, podem encontrar-se na sua forma parental ou ter sofrido biotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o. A elimina\u00e7\u00e3o desses pode ocorrer atrav\u00e9s das br\u00e2nquias, pele, b\u00edlis e urina. A biotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o de xenobi\u00f3ticos ocorre\nmaioritariamente no f\u00edgado e rim, e em menor grau nas guelras e mucosa intestinal. Os xenobi\u00f3ticos podem sofrer nestes \u00f3rg\u00e3os, uma s\u00e9rie de reac\u00e7\u00f5es sequenciais conducentes \u00e0 sua activa\u00e7\u00e3o, desintoxica\u00e7\u00e3o, acumula\u00e7\u00e3o e excre\u00e7\u00e3o. A biotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o, em termos gerais, \u00e9 entendida como a convers\u00e3o de um composto noutro, atrav\u00e9s de um conjunto de processos catalisados biologicamente. A fun\u00e7\u00e3o principal da biotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 a convers\u00e3o de xenobi\u00f3ticos lipof\u00edlicos em produtos mais hidrossol\u00faveis, facilitando a sua conjuga\u00e7\u00e3o e respectiva excre\u00e7\u00e3o, reduzindo deste modo a sua actividade biol\u00f3gica e tornando-os menos t\u00f3xicos. Contudo, conv\u00e9m salientar que a biotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o conduz por vezes \u00e0 bioactiva\u00e7\u00e3o dos contaminantes, formando metabolitos toxicologicamente mais potentes do que os compostos parentais, como por exemplo alguns HAP e fungicidas.\nWilliams (1959) prop\u00f4s a estrutura\u00e7\u00e3o do processo de biotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o em reac\u00e7\u00f5es de fase I e fase II, mantendo-se contudo presentes os conceitos de interdepend\u00eancia e continuidade entre estas duas etapas. Alguns autores consideram ainda a exist\u00eancia de uma fase III que consiste na metaboliza\u00e7\u00e3o adicional dos produtos resultantes das reac\u00e7\u00f5es de conjuga\u00e7\u00e3o da fase II, catalisadas por enzimas tamb\u00e9m envolvidas nas reac\u00e7\u00f5es de fase I e/ou II (Vermeulen, 1996). Apesar da maioria dos xenobi\u00f3ticos serem submetidos consecutivamente \u00e0s reac\u00e7\u00f5es de fase I e II, alguns podem ser submetidos apenas a uma dessas fases.\nOs mecanismos de fase I incluem reac\u00e7\u00f5es de oxida\u00e7\u00e3o, redu\u00e7\u00e3o ou hidr\u00f3lise que podem activar ou inactivar a ac\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00f3xica dos xenobi\u00f3ticos. As oxida\u00e7\u00f5es por monooxigenases associadas ao citocromo P450 ocorrem no ret\u00edculo endoplasm\u00e1tico liso, atrav\u00e9s da inser\u00e7\u00e3o de um \u00e1tomo de oxig\u00e9nio no substrato (Nelson et al., 1996). As monooxigenases possuem grande capacidade para metabolizar xenobi\u00f3ticos org\u00e2nicos e endobi\u00f3ticos, tais como ester\u00f3ides e \u00e1cidos gordos, encontrando-se especialmente no f\u00edgado (Stegeman e Hahn, 1994), embora a sua actividade tamb\u00e9m tenha sido detectada no rim, tracto intestinal e tecido branquial.\nA an\u00e1lise das in\u00fameras investiga\u00e7\u00f5es realizadas nesta \u00e1rea, demonstra uma acentuada concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de trabalhos no estudo da express\u00e3o do CYP1A, e em\nparticular das suas actividades enzim\u00e1ticas de 7-etoxiresorufina O-desetila\u00e7\u00e3o (EROD), 7-etoxicumarina O-desetila\u00e7\u00e3o (ECOD) e aril hidrocarbono hidroxila\u00e7\u00e3o (AHH). Esta maior incid\u00eancia de trabalhos est\u00e1 relacionada com o facto do CYP1A ser a principal forma de monooxigenase dependente do citocromo P450 (P450), em peixes, pass\u00edvel de ser induzida por xenobi\u00f3ticos org\u00e2nicos (Goksoyr et al., 1991). Assim, a indu\u00e7\u00e3o da actividade das monooxigenases microssomais hep\u00e1ticas associadas ao P450 tem sido largamente utilizada em estudos realizados em peixes como uma resposta caracter\u00edstica \u00e0 presen\u00e7a de poluentes org\u00e2nicos, tais como HAP (Maria et al., 2002; Sorrentino et al., 2005), policlorodibenzo-para-dioxinas (PCDD) e policloro dibenzofuranos (PCDF) (Orrego et al., 2005), bifenilo policlorados (PCB) (Vaccaro et al., 2005) e terfenilos policlorados (Hale et al., 1998). A indu\u00e7\u00e3o destas monooxigenases tem sido tamb\u00e9m utilizada no \u00e2mbito da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a outros contaminantes, tais como pesticidas (Egaas et al., 1999) ou ainda misturas de contaminantes, como os EPP (Pacheco e Santos, 1999; Larsson et al., 2002). Contudo, alguns contaminantes ambientais tal como metais pesados (Sorrentino et al., 2005) e compostos organoest\u00e2nicos (Fent e Stegeman, 1993), podem actuar como inibidores da actividade do P450. Diversos indutores da s\u00edntese de CYP1A podem tamb\u00e9m inibir a sua actividade catal\u00edtica, tendo sido esta duplicidade de ac\u00e7\u00f5es encontrada em peixes expostos a concentra\u00e7\u00f5es elevadas de PCB (Hahn et al., 1993) e HAP (Haash et al., 1993; Gravato e Santos, 2002c).\nOs produtos da fase I e outros xenobi\u00f3ticos, contendo grupos funcionais como hidroxilo, amino, ep\u00f3xido ou halog\u00e9neo, sofrem na fase II da biotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o, reac\u00e7\u00f5es de conjuga\u00e7\u00e3o com compostos polares end\u00f3genos, tais como o \u00e1cido glucor\u00f3nico, sulfato, glutationa ou determinados amino\u00e1cidos como a glicina e a glutamina. Os produtos de conjuga\u00e7\u00e3o, com raras excep\u00e7\u00f5es, s\u00e3o menos t\u00f3xicos, mais polares e mais facilmente excret\u00e1veis que os compostos qu\u00edmicos parentais. A actividade de enzimas de fase II, como a glutationa S-transferase (GST) e UDP-glucuronosil transferase (UDPGT), pode ser modulada em peixes pela exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a uma variedade de compostos tais como as dioxinas (Guosheng et al., 1998), HAP (Gravato e Santos, 2003), metais pesados (Ahmad et al., 2005), compostos\n2.2.\tGenotoxicidade\nAlguns compostos qu\u00edmicos podem induzir altera\u00e7\u00f5es no material gen\u00e9tico, sendo por isso designados de genot\u00f3xicos. A exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a este tipo de compostos, mesmo em pequenas quantidades, podem originar disfun\u00e7\u00f5es celulares e tecidulares atrav\u00e9s das altera\u00e7\u00f5es induzidas no genoma, por exemplo como resultado da sua liga\u00e7\u00e3o covalente com as bases do ADN formando aductos (Dolcetti et al., 2002; Hellou et al., 2005). Esses aductos do ADN podem ser respons\u00e1veis por muta\u00e7\u00f5es impedindo a replica\u00e7\u00e3o fidedigna do ADN ou desencadeando processos de repara\u00e7\u00e3o do ADN, nem sempre efectivos (Maccubbin, 1994), os quais poder\u00e3o levar a uma gradual acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de erros no material gen\u00e9tico.\nA avalia\u00e7\u00e3o das diferentes express\u00f5es de genotoxicidade tem sido levada a cabo recorrendo a m\u00e9todos bioqu\u00edmicos, moleculares e citogen\u00e9ticos. Os m\u00e9todos bioqu\u00edmicos, tais como o desenrolamento alcalino (Everaarts et al., 1998) e a elui\u00e7\u00e3o alcalina do ADN (Bihari et al., 1990) constituem as principais t\u00e9cnicas para avalia\u00e7\u00e3o das quebras do ADN. As t\u00e9cnicas citogen\u00e9ticas assumem particular relev\u00e2ncia no que respeita aos testes de troca entre crom\u00e1tides irm\u00e3s ou t\u00e9cnica de arlequim (sister chromatid exchange, SCE) (Santos e Pacheco, 1995), aberra\u00e7\u00f5es cromoss\u00f3micas (Jha et al., 2000), micron\u00facleos (Sanchez-Galan et al., 2001) e anomalias nucleares eritroc\u00edticas (ANE) (Pacheco e Santos, 1999; Ayll\u00f3n e Garcia-Vazquez, 2000). As altera\u00e7\u00f5es citogen\u00e9ticas que est\u00e3o na base das metodologias anteriores s\u00e3o entendidas como express\u00f5es de toxicidade gen\u00e9tica, pressupondo a exist\u00eancia de acontecimentos moleculares anteriores, como a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de aductos do ADN. De entre os par\u00e2metros anteriormente mencionados, recentemente t\u00eam assumido particular relev\u00e2ncia o teste de ANE devido \u00e0 sua facilidade e rapidez de execu\u00e7\u00e3o, sensibilidade, baixo custo e fiabilidade demonstrada em diferentes esp\u00e9cies de peixes expostos a metais pesados (Ayll\u00f3n e Garcia-Vazquez, 2000),\nDiversos estudos demonstraram claramente uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00f3xima entre os n\u00edveis de contamina\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental, n\u00edveis de contaminantes nos tecidos, e incid\u00eancia de cancro, muta\u00e7\u00f5es e malforma\u00e7\u00f5es nos embri\u00f5es em diversas esp\u00e9cies de peixes (Connell et al., 1999).\n2.3.\tAltera\u00e7\u00f5es end\u00f3crinas\nUma preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o crescente, relativa \u00e0 presen\u00e7a no ambiente de determinados compostos que podem interferir de algum modo com o sistema end\u00f3crino dos organismos, emergiu recentemente. A repetida constata\u00e7\u00e3o de efeitos adversos sobre diversas popula\u00e7\u00f5es da fauna selvagem e at\u00e9 no pr\u00f3prio Homem, foi o ponto de partida para a eclos\u00e3o mundial de in\u00fameras pesquisas acerca dos designados desreguladores end\u00f3crinos (DE). Ap\u00f3s a publica\u00e7\u00e3o do livro Our Stolen Future (Colborn et al., 1996), que re\u00fane e sistematiza os conhecimentos acumulados sobre as altera\u00e7\u00f5es end\u00f3crinas provocadas por v\u00e1rios compostos qu\u00edmicos existentes no ambiente, essa preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o deixou de ser exclusiva da comunidade cient\u00edfica, estendo-se tamb\u00e9m ao p\u00fablico em geral.\nO conceito de desregulador ou disruptor end\u00f3crino (endocrine disruptor) est\u00e1 associado a compostos ou misturas de compostos ex\u00f3genos, capazes de assumir fun\u00e7\u00e3o id\u00eantica \u00e0 de uma hormona natural ou inibir o funcionamento normal da mesma. Assim, as fun\u00e7\u00f5es do sistema end\u00f3crino s\u00e3o alteradas, afectando a sa\u00fade do organismo e/ou da sua descend\u00eancia (EDSTAC, 1998; IPCS, 2002).\nOs DE s\u00e3o derivados de compostos qu\u00edmicos de origem antropog\u00e9nica, na sua maioria provenientes de actividades industriais e dom\u00e9sticas, relacionadas com a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o/produ\u00e7\u00e3o de pl\u00e1sticos e detergentes, bem como do uso de alguns pesticidas. Em geral, estes compostos s\u00e3o est\u00e1veis, lipof\u00edlicos e semi-vol\u00e1teis, o que facilita a sua r\u00e1pida e vasta dispers\u00e3o no ambiente, tendo como principais ve\u00edculos\nA ac\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema end\u00f3crino envolve tr\u00eas elementos distintos, nomeadamente, um conjunto de gl\u00e2ndulas especializadas, mensageiros qu\u00edmicos (hormonas) sintetizados nessas gl\u00e2ndulas e c\u00e9lulas alvo. Os mecanismos de activa\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema end\u00f3crino t\u00eam in\u00edcio na reac\u00e7\u00e3o das c\u00e9lulas nervosas a um determinado est\u00edmulo (ex. fotoper\u00edodo, presen\u00e7a de xenobi\u00f3tico) e consequente envio de um sinal \u00e0s gl\u00e2ndulas end\u00f3crinas. Estas, por sua vez, libertam as hormonas adequadas, que se ligam a receptores espec\u00edficos e se traduzem em instru\u00e7\u00f5es para as c\u00e9lulas alvo. O receptor interpreta a mensagem hormonal fazendo a sua tradu\u00e7\u00e3o mediante um de dois processos celulares distintos: (i) indu\u00e7\u00e3o de genes para a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de novas prote\u00ednas e (ii) altera\u00e7\u00e3o da actividade de prote\u00ednas existentes na c\u00e9lula causando uma resposta r\u00e1pida.\nAs gl\u00e2ndulas end\u00f3crinas s\u00e3o o alvo preferencial dos contaminantes devido \u00e0 sua organiza\u00e7\u00e3o anat\u00f3mica associada a uma elevada vasculariza\u00e7\u00e3o. Este facto acentua a relev\u00e2ncia e o risco ecol\u00f3gico dos DE, cujo estudo dos mecanismos de ac\u00e7\u00e3o tem incidido na sua interac\u00e7\u00e3o com os receptores hormonais. Alguns compostos qu\u00edmicos contaminantes do meio ambiente podem, por exemplo, mimificar a ac\u00e7\u00e3o das hormonas end\u00f3genas, levando o organismo a desencadear de um modo exagerado ou em tempo inapropriado um est\u00edmulo falso, sendo o fen\u00f3meno designado por efeito agonista. Outros xenobi\u00f3ticos podem ligar-se aos receptores espec\u00edficos bloqueando-os, reduzindo ou anulando a respectiva est\u00edmula\u00e7\u00e3o, sendo este fen\u00f3meno denominado de efeito antagonista. Contudo, considerando a complexidade da ac\u00e7\u00e3o end\u00f3crina, \u00e9 plaus\u00edvel a exist\u00eancia de outros mecanismos de desregula\u00e7\u00e3o, que v\u00e3o desde a ac\u00e7\u00e3o directa nos \u00f3rg\u00e3os at\u00e9 \u00e0 interac\u00e7\u00e3o das pr\u00f3prias hormonas com o genoma (Reys, 2001). A altera\u00e7\u00e3o ou desregula\u00e7\u00e3o da fun\u00e7\u00e3o end\u00f3crina pode tamb\u00e9m estar associada \u00e0 interfer\u00eancia a diferentes n\u00edveis, como sejam a s\u00edntese, secre\u00e7\u00e3o, transporte no plasma, liga\u00e7\u00e3o e\nac\u00e7\u00e3o das hormonas, assim como a sua elimina\u00e7\u00e3o, conduzindo a uma nova resposta hormonal. Os principais factores que influenciam o modo de actua\u00e7\u00e3o dos DE no organismo relacionam-se com as propriedades qu\u00edmicas dos compostos, a sua concentra\u00e7\u00e3o, o tipo de interac\u00e7\u00e3o, tempo e momento de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o, factores gen\u00e9ticos, especificidade dos tecidos, idade e sexo. A ac\u00e7\u00e3o hormonal resulta de est\u00edmulos induzidos por concentra\u00e7\u00f5es muito baixas de hormonas, devendo salientar-se que essa \u00e9 a raz\u00e3o pela qual teores vestigiais de DE podem ser t\u00e3o perniciosos para os organismos.\n2.3.1.\tDisfun\u00e7\u00e3o de processos reprodutivos\nA grande maioria dos estudos realizados em peixes sobre os efeitos adversos dos DE tem sido dirigida para aspectos reprodutivos. O controlo neuroend\u00f3crino da reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 dependente da ac\u00e7\u00e3o coordenada de v\u00e1rias hormonas associadas ao eixo hipot\u00e1lamo-pituit\u00e1ria-g\u00f3nadas (HPG). Os est\u00edmulos sensoriais externos e internos condicionam a secre\u00e7\u00e3o da hormona libertadora da gonadotrofina (GnRH) pelo hipot\u00e1lamo, a qual, por sua vez, regula a liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de gonadotrofinas (GTH-I e GTH-II) pela pituit\u00e1ria. A GTH-I \u00e9 funcionalmente similar \u00e0 hormona fol\u00edculo-estimuladora (FSH) e a GTH-II \u00e9 similar \u00e0 hormona luteinizante (LH) dos mam\u00edferos (Schulz et al., 2001). As principais c\u00e9lulas-alvo das gonadotrofinas s\u00e3o as c\u00e9lulas da granulosa e da teca no ov\u00e1rio das f\u00eameas e as c\u00e9lulas de Sertoli e Leydig nos test\u00edculos dos machos (Janz, 2000). Estas c\u00e9lulas, ap\u00f3s estimula\u00e7\u00e3o pelas gonadotrofinas, sintetizam ester\u00f3ides sexuais (estrog\u00e9nios e androg\u00e9nios) e de matura\u00e7\u00e3o (progesteronas). O E2 e a estrona s\u00e3o os estrog\u00e9nios mais importantes nas f\u00eameas, desempenhando um papel fundamental na diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o sexual, desenvolvimento dos \u00f3rg\u00e3os reprodutores e indu\u00e7\u00e3o do comportamento sexual. Nos machos, a 11-cetotestosterona e a testosterona s\u00e3o os androg\u00e9nios mais importantes, sendo respons\u00e1veis pelo seu desenvolvimento sexual (Borg, 1994). As progesteronas s\u00e3o importantes na matura\u00e7\u00e3o dos ov\u00f3citos. Nos tele\u00f3steos, a\nA quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o de E2 no plasma de peixes tem sido utilizada como indicador da presen\u00e7a de DE no ambiente aqu\u00e1tico, em particular de xenoestrog\u00e9nios (subst\u00e2ncias que modulam ou mimificam a ac\u00e7\u00e3o dos ester\u00f3ides sexuais, principalmente do E2). Assim, diversos autores observaram altera\u00e7\u00e3o dos n\u00edveis de E2 plasm\u00e1tico ap\u00f3s exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a etoxilados de alquifen\u00f3is (Soverchia et al., 2005), pesticidas (Singh e Can\u00e1rio, 2004), HAPs (Seruto et al., 2005), PCBs (Jung et al., 2005) e EPPs (McMaster et al., 1996), bem como a misturas complexas inespec\u00edficas (Sep\u00falveda et al., 2002). Deste modo, altera\u00e7\u00f5es nos n\u00edveis plasm\u00e1ticos de E2 induzidas por contaminantes ambientais podem p\u00f4r em causa o sucesso reprodutivo. Por outro lado, elevados n\u00edveis de E2 na \u00e1gua podem causar efeitos adversos nos peixes, tais como indu\u00e7\u00e3o de intersexualidade em machos (Metcalfe et al., 2001), redu\u00e7\u00e3o do \u00edndice gonado-som\u00e1tico (Bjerselius et al., 2001) e da produ\u00e7\u00e3o de ovos (Oshima et al., 2003), assim como altera\u00e7\u00e3o do comportamento reprodutivo em machos (Bjerselius et al., 2001).\nAl\u00e9m dos efeitos anteriormente referidos, uma das respostas mais importantes \u00e0 presen\u00e7a de xeno/estrog\u00e9nios \u00e9 a indu\u00e7\u00e3o da transcri\u00e7\u00e3o e tradu\u00e7\u00e3o de determinadas prote\u00ednas, nomeadamente de uma fosfolipoglicoprote\u00edna, a Vtg. A sua s\u00edntese \u00e9 um processo estimulado pelo E2 envolvendo o controlo coordenado entre o hipot\u00e1lamo, pituit\u00e1ria, f\u00edgado e g\u00f3nadas (Thomas, 1990). A Vtg \u00e9 sintetizada no f\u00edgado de peixes ov\u00edparos, transportada at\u00e9 aos ov\u00e1rios onde \u00e9 sequestrada e incorporada nos ov\u00f3citos durante o seu desenvolvimento. A Vtg \u00e9 clivada proteoliticamente, ap\u00f3s sequestro, formando as prote\u00ednas do vitelo (lipovitelina e fosfovitina). Assim, a Vtg constitui a principal fonte de nutri\u00e7\u00e3o do embri\u00e3o em desenvolvimento, podendo ser encontrada no plasma de f\u00eameas maduras em concentra\u00e7\u00f5es elevadas. Normalmente, a presen\u00e7a de n\u00edveis significativos de Vtg no plasma ocorre apenas em f\u00eameas maduras. No entanto, os peixes juvenis e machos maduros possuem receptores de estrog\u00e9nios (Kishida et al., 1992), assim como um gene silencioso da Vtg, geralmente presente mas n\u00e3o expresso (Moncaut et al.,\n2003). Deste modo, os machos e juvenis podem responder \u00e0 presen\u00e7a de xeno/estrog\u00e9nios, produzindo Vtg, a qual tende a permanecer no plasma em n\u00edveis elevados devido \u00e0 falta de mecanismos de elimina\u00e7\u00e3o (Funkenstein et al., 2000). V\u00e1rios autores observaram aumentos da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de Vtg no plasma de diferentes esp\u00e9cies de peixes ap\u00f3s exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a E2 e xenoestrog\u00e9nios (Arukwe et al., 1998; Berg et al., 2004; Andreassen et al., 2005; Soverchia et al., 2005), o que forneceu evid\u00eancia da grande sensibilidade deste par\u00e2metro como indicador da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a DE.\n2.3.2.\tDisfun\u00e7\u00e3o de processos n\u00e3o reprodutivos\nAtendendo \u00e0 concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de trabalhos cient\u00edficos que incidem nos mecanismos de ac\u00e7\u00e3o dos DE na reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o, poder-se-ia inferir que a ac\u00e7\u00e3o destes se limita a aspectos da biologia da reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o. No entanto, \u00e0 medida que a investiga\u00e7\u00e3o foi sendo aprofundada, concluiu-se que o sistema end\u00f3crino n\u00e3o-reprodutor poderia tamb\u00e9m ser um alvo potencial de desregula\u00e7\u00e3o por ac\u00e7\u00e3o destes xenobi\u00f3ticos. Neste contexto, os eixos hipot\u00e1lamo-pituit\u00e1ria-tecido interrenal (HPI) e hipot\u00e1lamo-pituit\u00e1ria-tir\u00f3ide (HPT) t\u00eam particular relev\u00e2ncia pelo seu papel essencial nos mecanismos homeost\u00e1ticos em peixes (Hontela, 1997; Janz, 2000). O cortisol \u00e9 o principal corticoester\u00f3ide em peixes, sendo tamb\u00e9m o mais abundante e activo, ocorrendo a sua s\u00edntese em c\u00e9lulas do tecido interrenal, situadas na por\u00e7\u00e3o cef\u00e1lica do rim. A s\u00edntese e liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de cortisol na circula\u00e7\u00e3o sangu\u00ednea envolvem um sistema de retrocontrolo associado ao eixo HPI. Quando o organismo \u00e9 submetido a uma situa\u00e7\u00e3o de stresse, o hipot\u00e1lamo produz a hormona libertadora da corticotrofina (CRH), a qual controla a s\u00edntese da hormona adrenocorticotr\u00f3fica (ACTH) pela pituit\u00e1ria anterior, que por sua vez, estimula a s\u00edntese e liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de cortisol pelo tecido interrenal (Hontela, 1997). Uma parte do cortisol libertado, circula no plasma sangu\u00edneo, ligado de modo revers\u00edvel a prote\u00ednas, numa forma biologicamente inerte, sendo que apenas a sua forma livre apresenta actividade fisiol\u00f3gica (Hazon e Balmen, 1998).\nOs principais \u00f3rg\u00e3os-alvo do cortisol s\u00e3o as br\u00e2nquias, f\u00edgado e intestino, sendo tamb\u00e9m importante a sua ac\u00e7\u00e3o sobre o m\u00fasculo esquel\u00e9tico (Hontela, 1997; Hazon e Balment, 1998). O cortisol apresenta diversas ac\u00e7\u00f5es fisiol\u00f3gicas, das quais se destacam os efeitos sobre o metabolismo intermedi\u00e1rio (Hontela, 1997). Esta ac\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 crucial na manuten\u00e7\u00e3o da homeostase em situa\u00e7\u00f5es de stresse prolongado e tende, em termos gerais, a aumentar a liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de m\u00f3leculas-substrato para a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de energia, a partir das reservas corporais. Desta forma, \u00e9 estimulado o catabolismo dos l\u00edpidos e prote\u00ednas, concomitantemente com a indu\u00e7\u00e3o das aminotransferases e da gluconeog\u00e9nese (Quintana, 2002). Para al\u00e9m dos efeitos anteriormente referidos, o cortisol exerce tamb\u00e9m a sua ac\u00e7\u00e3o a n\u00edveis como a osmorregula\u00e7\u00e3o (Sakamoto e McCormick, 2006) e a fun\u00e7\u00e3o imune (Harris e Bird,\n2000).\nO aumento da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de cortisol no plasma de peixes foi demonstrado ap\u00f3s exposi\u00e7\u00f5es de curto prazo a uma vasta gama de contaminantes, desde metais pesados (De Boeck et al., 2003), AR (Kennedy et al., 1995), HAP (Pacheco e Santos, 2001a) e pesticidas (Waring e Moore, 2004), at\u00e9 hormonas \u201cnaturais\u201d como o E2 (Pottinger et al., 1996). Apesar das evid\u00eancias anteriores, a resposta dos peixes em termos de din\u00e2mica do cortisol revelou-se mais complexa, tendo sido demonstrado que peixes expostos cronicamente a contaminantes ambientais eram incapazes de elevar os seus n\u00edveis de cortisol plasm\u00e1tico como resposta ao stresse resultante da captura. Este facto foi observado em peixes de \u00e1guas polu\u00eddas com metais pesados, HAP, PCB, bem como EPP (Hontela, 1997). N\u00edveis baixos de cortisol no plasma foram tamb\u00e9m detectados em exposi\u00e7\u00f5es de curto prazo a AR (Kennedy et al., 1995), derivados de pesticidas organoclorados (Benguira et al., 2002), EPP (Santos e Pacheco, 1996), assim como \u00e0 frac\u00e7\u00e3o sol\u00favel de combust\u00edveis f\u00f3sseis (Pacheco e Santos, 2001b).\nO valor informativo das altera\u00e7\u00f5es da din\u00e2mica do cortisol, no que respeita a diferentes formas de stresse deve ser entendido como parte de uma resposta mais generalizada e complexa. O aumento de cortisol no plasma, precedido de um aumento de catecolaminas, constitui apenas uma etapa na sequ\u00eancia de\nacontecimentos adaptativos mobilizadores de energia. Assim, altera\u00e7\u00f5es no metabolismo intermedi\u00e1rio s\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m reconhecidas como potenciais indicadores de stresse. Neste contexto, a eleva\u00e7\u00e3o dos n\u00edveis plasm\u00e1ticos de lactato e glucose tem demonstrado a sua efici\u00eancia no que respeita \u00e0 detec\u00e7\u00e3o de exposi\u00e7\u00f5es de peixes a pesticidas (Sancho et al., 1997), metais pesados (Hontela et al., 1996) e EPP (Santos et al., 1990).\nNa maioria dos tele\u00f3steos, a tir\u00f3ide \u00e9 composta por grupos de fol\u00edculos distribu\u00eddos de uma forma difusa, principalmente, em torno da faringe ventral onde s\u00e3o sintetizadas as hormonas tiroxina (T4) e triiodotironina (T3). Os fol\u00edculos da tir\u00f3ide podem tamb\u00e9m desenvolver-se em locais secund\u00e1rios como os ov\u00e1rios, rim e peric\u00e1rdio (Hazon e Balment, 1998; Janz, 2000). A s\u00edntese e liberta\u00e7\u00e3o destas hormonas no sangue s\u00e3o controladas por um sistema de retrocontrolo associado ao eixo HPT. O hipot\u00e1lamo produz a hormona libertadora da tirotrofina (TRH), a qual controla a s\u00edntese da hormona estimuladora da tir\u00f3ide (TSH) pela pituit\u00e1ria anterior, que por sua vez estimula a s\u00edntese e liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de T4 e T3 pelos fol\u00edculos da tir\u00f3ide. Nos peixes, tal como nos outros vertebrados, existe uma s\u00edntese muito maior de T4 do que de T3. Estas hormonas circulam no sangue associadas a prote\u00ednas transportadoras (Power et al., 2001) e apenas a frac\u00e7\u00e3o livre se pode difundir para os tecidos perif\u00e9ricos (Eales e Brown, 1993). Quando a T4 entra em contacto com os tecidos-alvo \u00e9, na sua maioria, convertida em T3 via 5'-monodesiodase, existindo fortes provas de que esta desempenha um papel fisiol\u00f3gico mais relevante (Hazon e Balment, 1998).\nAs hormonas tir\u00f3ideias contribuem para o controlo do metabolismo, osmorregula\u00e7\u00e3o, crescimento e desenvolvimento (Hazon e Balment, 1998; Yamano, 2005). Altera\u00e7\u00f5es nos n\u00edveis plasm\u00e1ticos de hormonas da tir\u00f3ide foram detectadas em peixes ap\u00f3s exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a PCB (Brown et al., 2004), metais pesados (Carletta et al., 2002) e pesticidas (Thangavel et al., 2005).\nAs hormonas da tir\u00f3ide e o cortisol podem interagir e influenciar conjuntamente o metabolismo dos hidratos de carbono (Hontela et al., 1995); no entanto, pouco se sabe acerca destas interdepend\u00eancias em peixes.\nPara se proceder \u00e0 avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do estado de um determinado ecossistema, cada vez mais se tem recorrido \u00e0 adop\u00e7\u00e3o de programas de biomonitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental, baseados na medi\u00e7\u00e3o de respostas biol\u00f3gicas, as quais s\u00e3o genericamente designadas de biomarcadores. Um biomarcador \u00e9 definido como uma resposta biol\u00f3gica induzida, geralmente, por xenobi\u00f3ticos, mensur\u00e1vel em sistemas biol\u00f3gicos, ou amostras destes, abrangendo diferentes n\u00edveis, desde molecular, celular ou fisiol\u00f3gico at\u00e9 comportamental (NRC, 1989; WHO, 1993). Num contexto ambiental, os biomarcadores s\u00e3o considerados ferramentas altamente informativas no que respeita \u00e0 detec\u00e7\u00e3o da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a contaminantes ou dos respectivos efeitos (Van der Oost et al., 2003). A utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de biomarcadores oferece ainda a possibilidade de obter um entendimento mecan\u00edstico ou de causa-efeito dos processos biol\u00f3gicos. Adicionalmente, esta estrat\u00e9gia apresenta uma vantagem, relativamente \u00e0 monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica, que resulta do facto dos resultados integrarem eventuais interac\u00e7\u00f5es toxicol\u00f3gicas que podem ocorrer na sequ\u00eancia da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a misturas de contaminantes (Van der Oost et al., 2003).\nDe acordo com o National Research Council (NRC, 1989) e a World Health Organization (WHO, 1993), os biomarcadores podem ser divididos em tr\u00eas classes:\n(i)\tbiomarcadores de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o - abrangem a detec\u00e7\u00e3o e quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o de um composto ex\u00f3geno, dos seus metabolitos ou da interac\u00e7\u00e3o entre este e mol\u00e9culas ou c\u00e9lulas alvo, sendo medidos num compartimento do organismo; (ii) biomarcadores de efeito - incluem altera\u00e7\u00f5es bioqu\u00edmicas, fisiol\u00f3gicas e outras, sendo mensur\u00e1veis nos tecidos ou flu\u00eddos corporais e reconhecidamente associadas a poss\u00edveis desequil\u00edbrios; (iii) biomarcadores de susceptibilidade - indicam a capacidade inerente ou adquirida de um organismo alterar a susceptibilidade a uma exposi\u00e7\u00e3o, envolvendo nomeadamente factores gen\u00e9ticos. Apesar das respostas medidas a n\u00edveis organizacionais mais b\u00e1sicos poderem n\u00e3o ter reflexo directo ao n\u00edvel, por exemplo, da popula\u00e7\u00e3o ou comunidade, podem funcionar como um instrumento de vigil\u00e2ncia ambiental que permite identificar o risco a esses n\u00edveis. Adicionalmente,\nNa sequ\u00eancia do anteriormente exposto, as respostas biol\u00f3gicas a contaminantes consideradas na presente tese e anteriormente apresentadas, podem ser encaradas como potenciais biomarcadores, n\u00e3o obstando contudo a que, dependendo dos objectivos em causa, o seu estudo possa ser mais ou menos dirigido para o entendimento dos mecanismos envolvidos nas respostas t\u00f3xicas.\n3.\tORIENTA\u00c7\u00d5ES E OBJECTIVOS DA TESE\nA complexidade dos ecossistemas aqu\u00e1ticos torna a sua caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o ecotoxicol\u00f3gica dif\u00edcil, uma vez que as respostas dos organismos \u00e0 presen\u00e7a de contaminantes dependem de uma s\u00e9rie de factores bi\u00f3ticos e abi\u00f3ticos. Nesta perspectiva, deve recorrer-se a diferentes metodologias e estrat\u00e9gias de monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o que podem englobar exposi\u00e7\u00f5es laboratoriais, in situ, bem como amostragens de campo de esp\u00e9cimes selvagens.\nAs exposi\u00e7\u00f5es laboratoriais proporcionam um grau de variabilidade menor relativamente \u00e0s exposi\u00e7\u00f5es de campo, permitindo um controlo de vari\u00e1veis relativas \u00e0 qualidade da \u00e1gua, tais como a temperatura, salinidade, oxig\u00e9nio dissolvido, assim como outros factores abi\u00f3ticos incluindo o fotoper\u00edodo. A anterior forma de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o permite ainda a selec\u00e7\u00e3o de uma determinada esp\u00e9cie num estado espec\u00edfico de desenvolvimento, o controlo sobre o n\u00famero de indiv\u00edduos expostos, o n\u00famero de r\u00e9plicas, o tipo de composto a testar e sua concentra\u00e7\u00e3o, bem como o tempo e vias de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o (Lindstrom-Seppa e Oikari, 1990). Apesar das vantagens anteriormente referidas relativamente a exposi\u00e7\u00f5es laboratoriais, estas n\u00e3o reflectem completamente a complexidade do tipo de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o que ocorre nos sistemas naturais, o que dificulta a extrapola\u00e7\u00e3o dos dados laboratoriais para situa\u00e7\u00f5es reais de campo (Maycock et al., 2003). Assim, as observa\u00e7\u00f5es laboratoriais podem estar sub ou sobrestimados, pelo que se torna vantajosa e recomend\u00e1vel a sua valida\u00e7\u00e3o no campo. Os dados fornecidos por estudos de campo usando esp\u00e9cies ind\u00edgenas reflectem melhor aquilo que acontece no \u201cmundo real\u201d (Sibley et al., 1999). No entanto, aspectos como a mobilidade dos peixes, distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial dos contaminantes, imprecis\u00e3o do tempo de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o e desconhecimento do \u201chistorial\u201d dos peixes s\u00e3o factores limitantes para a interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o dos dados de campo.\nAlgumas das vari\u00e1veis associadas aos estudos de campo podem ser eliminadas recorrendo ao transplante de organismos para o local cuja contamina\u00e7\u00e3o se quer avaliar - exposi\u00e7\u00f5es in situ. Esta estrat\u00e9gia \u00e9 considerada uma ferramenta fundamental para a toxicologia aqu\u00e1tica, reduzindo a incerteza associada \u00e0s extrapola\u00e7\u00f5es laborat\u00f3rio-campo (Burton et al., 2000) e constituindo uma abordagem\ninterm\u00e9dia em que se reduzem as limita\u00e7\u00f5es dos estudos de campo e se usufrui de parte das vantagens das exposi\u00e7\u00f5es laboratoriais. Contudo, as exposi\u00e7\u00f5es in situ apresentam ainda algumas limita\u00e7\u00f5es, tais como a dificuldade em encontrar locais de refer\u00eancia adequados, o risco de vandalismo, os efeitos do enclausuramento dos organismos, a ac\u00e7\u00e3o predat\u00f3ria e a fraca aplicabilidade em sistemas profundos e de fortes correntes (Burton et al., 2005). Apesar das referidas limita\u00e7\u00f5es, esta estrat\u00e9gia tem sido largamente utilizada para prever efeitos em comunidades ind\u00edgenas e orientar estudos futuros mais definitivos relativamente \u00e0 quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o de qu\u00edmicos, testes laboratoriais de toxicidade, bem como \u00e0 adop\u00e7\u00e3o de medidas preventivas (Pacheco e Santos, 1999; Schulz, 2003; Burton et al.; 2005). A presente tese baseou-se na utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de duas estrat\u00e9gias - ensaios laboratoriais e exposi\u00e7\u00f5es in situ - representando uma evolu\u00e7\u00e3o do estudo no sentido da m\u00e1xima aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 situa\u00e7\u00e3o real de campo (captura), cuja aus\u00eancia n\u00e3o deve ser encarada como uma minimiza\u00e7\u00e3o da sua import\u00e2ncia.\nOs ambientes aqu\u00e1ticos polu\u00eddos s\u00e3o tipicamente caracterizados pela presen\u00e7a de misturas de contaminantes e n\u00e3o pela presen\u00e7a de um ou de outro contaminante isolado. As estrat\u00e9gias do presente estudo tiveram subjacente a ideia de que a previs\u00e3o do resultado da interac\u00e7\u00e3o entre diferentes contaminantes pode ser imprecisa se baseada apenas no estudo do impacto dos compostos individuais. Contudo, o recurso \u00e0 experimenta\u00e7\u00e3o laboratorial com contaminantes isolados foi tamb\u00e9m considerado como um ponto de partida incontorn\u00e1vel em direc\u00e7\u00e3o ao estudo do impacto de misturas. Assim, a estrat\u00e9gia global evoluiu para a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de ensaios laboratoriais com misturas simples e cuja complexidade poder\u00e1 de futuro ser progressivamente aumentada.\nOs peixes utilizados no presente trabalho de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o encontravam-se em estados de imaturidade sexual. A raz\u00e3o desta escolha prendeu-se com o facto de se pretender diminuir a interfer\u00eancia de processos metab\u00f3licos associados \u00e0 reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o em outros processos chave sob estudo. Assim, o conhecimento da ac\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00f3xica de xenobi\u00f3ticos presentes na \u00e1gua sobre juvenis, poder\u00e1 informar e prevenir essa ac\u00e7\u00e3o em est\u00e1dios posteriores de desenvolvimento.\nA presente tese engloba tr\u00eas perspectivas distintas mas complementares, relativamente ao tipo de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a contaminantes e subst\u00e2ncias padr\u00e3o a que os organismos teste foram submetidos. Assim, estabeleceu-se um plano de trabalho que incluiu os seguintes objectivos:\n(i)\tEstudo dos efeitos de exposi\u00e7\u00f5es laboratoriais a contaminantes isolados, nomeadamente \u00e1cidos abi\u00e9tico e desidroabi\u00e9tico, reteno, p-naftoflavona (BNF), naftaleno e E2 (cap\u00edtulos II a VI);\n(ii)\tEstudo dos efeitos de exposi\u00e7\u00f5es laboratoriais a diferentes contaminantes, quer em misturas simples (BNF+E2, BNF+NP, E2+NP), quer em exposi\u00e7\u00f5es sequenciais (BNF+Cr, BNF+Cu) (cap\u00edtulos VII a IX);\n(iii)\tEstudo dos efeitos de exposi\u00e7\u00f5es in situ em ambientes aqu\u00e1ticos polu\u00eddos (Ria de Aveiro, Rio Vouga e Pateira de Fermentelos) (cap\u00edtulos X e XI).\nOs compostos testados incluem-se em diferentes classes de contaminantes do meio aqu\u00e1tico, tendo sido seleccionados pela sua import\u00e2ncia a n\u00edvel global e regional, assim como pelo relevo que o seu estudo assume, dada a relativa escassez de informa\u00e7\u00e3o no que respeita aos seus efeitos sobre peixes.\nOs par\u00e2metros avaliados foram: conte\u00fado em citocromo P450, actividade de EROD, GST e alanina transaminase (ALT) no f\u00edgado, \u00edndice hepato-som\u00e1tico (IHS), frequ\u00eancia de ANE e eritr\u00f3citos imaturos (EI), n\u00edveis plasm\u00e1ticos de cortisol, glucose, lactato, TSH, T3, T4, E2 e Vtg.\n4.\tREFER\u00caNCIAS BIBLIOGR\u00c1FICAS\nAaltonen, T.M.; Jokinen, E.I.; Lappivaara, J.; Markkula, S.E.; Salo, H.M.; Leppanen, H.; Lammi, R.

The eels plasma cortisol, glucose and lactate were measured. A significant decrease in plasma cortisol was observed at 72 h exposure to 0.9 pM and 2.7 pM Re. DHAA (0.1 pM) significantly decreased plasma cortisol in eels after 8 and 24 h exposure. However, a significant plasma cortisol increase was found after 16 h, 2.7 pM AA exposure and after 24 h exposure to 0.1 pM and 2.7 pM AA. Furthermore, 72 h exposure to.0.9 pM AA also induced a plasma cortisol increase. A general rise in plasma glucose was detected after all exposure periods to Re. The plasma lactate also increased after 72 h exposure to 2.7pM AA and after 8 h exposure to 0.1 pM DHAA.\nKeywords: A. anguilla; Abietic acid; Dehydroabietic acid; Retene; Cortisol; Glucose; Lactate; Endocrine disruption.\nINTRODUCTION\nBleached kraft pulp mill effluents (BKPME) are complex mixtures of environmentally active compounds (Nestmann et al., 1980). The most prevalent compounds in BKPMEs are resin acids (RAs) representing an important toxicant group to fish. Abietic (AA) and dehydroabietic (DHAA) acids are the most abundant among the seven RAs. Thermal degradation of abietic-type RAs as well as anaerobic microbial DHAA degradation (Makris and Banerjee, 2002) represents important retene (Re) sources. Thus, the effluent treatment can also originate active metabolites such as Re due to anaerobic zones within aeration ponds.\nFarm or wild eel's 4 h exposure to the 50% secondary treated bleached kraft pulp mill effluent (STBKPME), after 188 h recovery from capture, anoxia and transport, induces plasma lactate increase and prevents interrenal cortisol release to the blood, decreasing its plasma concentration (Santos and Pacheco, 1996). Additionally, cortisol and lactate uptake from plasma are depressed in eels after 6 h\nrecovery from capture, anoxia and transport, at 25 \u00b0C in 50% STBKPME. The use of plasma cortisol as an indicator of physiological status has been well documented in numerous studies (reviewed by Hontela, 1997). Recent in vivo studies demonstrated that some environmental pollutants could act as endocrine disrupters in fish (Van der Kraak et al., 1992), and one of the endocrine targets of xenobiotics seems to be the hypothalamo-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis (Hontela, 1998).\nAcute stress, such as handling and confinement (Iwama et al., 1976), exposure to low pH, heavy metals (Hontela et al., 1995), chlorinated resin acids (RAs) (Kennedy et al., 1995) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Thomas and Rice, 1987) induced a plasma cortisol increase in several fish species. Further studies also demonstrated that eels exposed either to diesel water-soluble fraction (Pacheco and Santos, 2003) or to naphthalene (Teles et al., 2003) had their plasma cortisol levels decreased. According to Hontela et al. (1997) and McMaster et al. (1994), fish sampled at contaminated sites had an impaired capacity to increase their plasma cortisol levels in response to stress. Nevertheless, it remains difficult to determine if the toxicological effects of pollutants occur at the level of cortisol synthesis in interrenal steroidogenic cells, upstream in the pituitary and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) synthesis, in the hypothalamic cells, or elsewhere in the organism.\nChanges in carbohydrate metabolism measured as plasmatic glucose and lactate can be used as general stress indicators in fish, and their relation to cortisol function were also investigated (Santos and Pacheco, 1996; Pacheco and Santos,\n2001).\nThe vast majority of BKPME toxicity studies on fish concerns the effluent as a whole. Thus, the effects of single effluent compounds need to be investigated. The present research work intends to study the AA, DHAA and Re individual effects on Anguilla anguilla L. plasma lactate, glucose and cortisol levels.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nChemicals\nAll chemicals were of analytical grade obtained from Sigma Chemicals Company (USA), Boehringer-Mannheim GmbH (Germany), and E. Merck-Darmstadt (Germany). Abietic acid and retene (7-isopropopyl-1-methylphenanthrene) were obtained from Sigma. Dehydroabietic acid was obtained from Helix Biotech (Canada).\nTest Animals\nA. anguilla L. with an average weight of 50 g and measuring 30\u00b12 cm were captured at the Aveiro lagoon, Murtosa, Portugal. The eels were transported in anoxia and acclimated to laboratory conditions for 1 week prior to experimentation. During recovery and experimental periods, eels were kept in 80-L aquaria at 20 \u00b0C temperature under a natural photoperiod, in recirculating, aerated (dissolved oxygen: 7.4\u00b10.2 mg/L), filtered and dechlorinated tap water with a pH of 7.1 \u00b10.2. Fish were fed neither under laboratory adaptation nor during the experimental procedure.\nExperimental Design\nThree different lots of eels were exposed during 8, 16, 24 and 72 h to abietic acid, dehydroabietic acid or retene in the following concentration range - 0 (control), 0.1, 0.3, 0.9 and 2.7 p.M. Experiments were carried out using test groups of five eels (n=5). The appropriate amount of each chemical was previously dissolved in 1 mL of DMSO and added to the experimental aquaria. The same volume of DMSO was added to the control aquarium. This DMSO concentration has no effects (Pacheco and Santos, 1998). During the exposure period the water was not replaced.\nFish were killed at each sampling point and their blood was collected for plasma isolation using an Eppendorf centrifuge (14,000 rpm).\nBiochemical Analyses\nCortisol, Lactate and Glucose Measurement\nThe determination of cortisol was performed in plasma using a diagnostic ELISA direct immunoenzymatic kit (Diametra, Italy, code 10011). Plasma lactate was determined with a diagnostic kit (Boehringer Mannheim GmgH, n\u00b0149993). Plasma glucose was measured using a diagnostic kit (Granutest, E. Merck-Darmstadt n\u00b01.12194).\nStatistical Analyses\nStatistica software (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK) was used for statistical analyses. All the data were first tested for normality and homogeneity of variance to meet statistical demands. Variance analysis was used to compare results between fish groups, followed by LSD test (Zar, 1996). Differences between means were considered significant when P<0.05.\nRESULTS\nAbietic Acid Experiment\nThe general trend in plasma cortisol is an increase observed from 16 up to 72 h (Fig. 1A). Nevertheless, a significant increase could be only observed at 72 h exposure to 0.9 pM, at 24 h exposure to 0.1 pM and to 2.7 pM, and at 16 h exposure to 2.7 pM AA. A significant glucose increase was observed after 24 h exposure to 0.9 and 2.7 pM and after 72 h to 0.3, 0.9, and 2.7 pM AA (Fig. 1B). A plasma lactate increase was observed after 72 h exposure to 2.7 pM AA.\nDehydroabietic Acid Experiment\nA significant decrease in plasma cortisol levels was observed after 8 and 24 h exposure to 0.1 pM (Fig. 2A). A significant plasma glucose rise was found after 24 h exposure to 0.3 pM DHAA (Fig. 2B). Plasma lactate levels significantly increased only after 8 h exposure to 0.1 pM DHAA (Fig. 2C).\nRetene Experiment\nA decreasing tendency in plasma cortisol levels was observed during the whole experiment. However, this tendency was confirmed at 72 h where a statistically significant decrease was observed for 0.9 and 2.7 liM Re exposure (Fig. 3A). A plasma glucose rise was commonly found at all the exposure periods. Thus, a significant increase was observed after 8 h exposure to 0.1, 0.9 and 2.7 liM Re. After 16 h exposure to 2.7 liM Re, a significant increase in plasma glucose levels was observed, whereas at 24 h exposure, this increase was significant for all tested concentrations. Furthermore, eels showed a significant plasma glucose increase after 72 h exposure to 0.3, 0.9 and 2.7 liM (Fig. 3B). Despite the absence of statistically significant differences, a clear plasma lactate decrease was detected after 8 and 16 h exposure following the increase in Re concentration. However, this tendency seems to disappear for the longest exposure periods (Fig. 3C).\nExposure Time (hours)\nFig. 1 - A. anguilla L. plasma cortisol levels (A), plasma glucose levels (B) and plasma lactate levels (C) after 8, 16, 24, and 72 h exposure to abietic acid (0, 0.1,0.3, 0.9 and 2,7 pM).

Differences from control: *P<0.05.\nDISCUSSION\nThe assessment of the BKPME sublethal effects must also include the study of their individual components. Moreover, Oikari and Lindstom-Seppa (1990) suggested that if some parameters are considered as important endpoints, it must be of primary interest to know which components of BKPMEs are responsible for those effects. In this perspective and considering the lack of data concerning AA, DHAA and Re effects on aquatic animals, namely fish; the present research work becomes ecotoxicologically relevant.\nIn this study, the eels exposed to the highest AA concentrations (0.9 and 2.7 pM) displayed a significant plasma cortisol increase. This response is in agreement with a well-established pattern for short-term exposures to chemical stressors, where fish exposed to chemical pollutants such as heavy metals, acid waters (Donaldson et al., 1984; Thomas, 1990) or to chlorinated RAs (Kennedy et al., 1995) exhibited elevated plasma cortisol. However, DHAA and Re exposures demonstrated that eels were unable to increase their plasma cortisol as a normal reaction to capture and handling, when compared to control levels, suggesting that an endocrine-impaired response has occurred. The eel's decrease in plasma cortisol levels found after DHAA and Re exposure seems to agree with previous results obtained after 4 h exposure to BKPME (Santos and Pacheco, 1996). Furthermore, A. anguilla exposed to diesel water-soluble fraction during 3 h up to 3 days (Pacheco and Santos, 2001), and to naphthalene during 24 h (Teles et al., 2003) also exhibited a plasma cortisol decrease.\nHontela et al. (1992) stated that only fish chronically exposed to pollutants exhibited an impaired cortisol function. However, our results do not agree with the previous statement. Cortisol responses are complex, depending on fish species and tested xenobiotics rather than on short-term vs. long-term exposure. Furthermore, the fish plasma cortisol uptake by different body tissues after exposure to a xenobiotic compound mixture such as BKPME as previously demonstrated depends on the effluent temperature (20-25 \u00b0C) (Santos and Pacheco, 1996).\nSome authors explained the cortisol response impairment by an exhaustion of the cortisol-producing system and pituitary corticotrope atrophy, possibly as a result of its prolonged hyperactivity (Hontela et al., 1992, 1995; Brodeur et al., 1997). Considering short-term effects, Santos and Pacheco (1996) proposed that the interrenal cortisol release might be prevented by the contaminant (i.e. endocrine disruptor), since a high cortisol concentration in the interrenal tissue was observed in parallel with a low plasma cortisol concentration. This interpretation for short-term effects may complement Hontela's (1997) explanation, since an eventual long-term exposure may lead to a negative feedback, and consequent pituitary corticotrope atrophy. However, it is not possible to clarify the mechanism involved in this endocrine disruption, considering the present experimental design, and complementary parameters should be evaluated.\nThere is some evidence that mammals acute exposures to DDT and its metabolites exert direct adrenal cytotoxicity thus impairing the adrenal function and the ability to secrete cortisol (Lund et al., 1988; Jonsson, 1994). Similarly, an eventual interrenal functional impairment produced by DHAA and Re may be due to a direct cytotoxic action and/or to sterodoigenesis interference.\nTherefore, the cortisol impairment observed by Santos and Pacheco (1996) in A. anguilla after short-term exposure to BKPME may be associated with the presence of DHAA and Re in the effluent, suggesting their capacity to overcome the AA effects. A cortisol secretion dysfunction reduces the fish physiological competence, growth, and survivorship since this hormone is required for a wide range of important homeostatic mechanisms, including fuel reserves mobilization. Therefore, the current results demonstrate the ecotoxicological risks associated with fish populations exposed to pulp mill effluent discharges.\nFish carbohydrate metabolism may be altered through exposure to a variety of stressors. In this context, a typical stress response includes plasma glucose and lactate increase (Lowe-Linde and Niimi, 1984; Hontela et al., 1996; Santos and Pacheco, 1996). These responses have an adaptive value since they augment the\navailability of energy substrates, necessary for homeostasis maintenance (Donaldson et al., 1984).\nIn the current study, eels exposed to AA and Re displayed a general increase in plasma glucose, whereas the response to DHAA was less comprehensible, revealing a significant increase only at 24 h. The plasma lactate response seems to be more complex, depending on the tested compound, since a significant plasma lactate increase was detected only for the shortest DHAA exposure and for longest AA exposure. Thus, a plasma lactate increase should be regarded as an expected response, considering previous results in the same species exposed to 50% BKPMEs during 4 h (Santos et al., 1993).\nThe previously reported pattern, i.e., blood cortisol, glucose and lactate increase, was observed only after exposure to AA. However, DHAA and Re responses followed a different pattern, since a plasma cortisol decrease was accompanied by its glucose increase in both experiments and by a lactate increase in DHAA experiment. Therefore, the results concerning plasma glucose increase due to DHAA and Re exposure may be related to an increased cortisol uptake from blood by organs such as liver without its replacement in blood circulation by the interrenal tissue. The establishment of a consistent relation between plasma cortisol, glucose and lactate seems difficult. Further studies are required to elucidate the link between endocrine and metabolic dysfunctions in fish affected by pulp mill components.\nCONCLUSIONS\nA reduced capacity to elevate plasma cortisol after capture and handling was found in A. anguilla exposed to dehydroabietic acid and retene. However, this ability was not affected by abietic acid exposure, since an elevated plasma cortisol was observed. All the tested chemicals were able to induce a plasma glucose increase, while plasma lactate only responded to RAs.\nThe interaction between cortisol function and carbohydrate metabolism was not clear. Nevertheless, the measurement of plasma steroid levels such as cortisol,\nACKOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors express their appreciation for the financial support provided by the Aveiro University Research Institute and by the \u201cFunda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia\u201d (FCT - Grant no.

Phase II biotransformation and cortisol levels were also assessed in NAP-treated fish. Two groups of eels were exposed to either a NAP or a BNF concentration range (0.1-2.7 p,M) for different exposure periods (2-72 h). An early significant ethoxyresorufin 0-deethylation (EROD) activity inhibition was observed, especially for the highest NAP concentrations at 2-6 h exposure and for BNF at 2 h exposure. However, a significant EROD activity increase was detected from 16 to 72 h exposure for NAP and from 4 to 72 h exposure for BNF. The cytochrome P450 (P450) content was not dose related. However, with regard to BNF exposure, P450 was the first biomarker to respond. Liver alanine transaminase (ALT) activity was measured as an indicator of hepatic health condition. ALT results demonstrated that the EROD activity decrease, previously described for NAP, was not related to tissue damage. Nevertheless, the highest BNF concentrations were demonstrated to induce liver damage and to impair the EROD activity response. An increased genotoxic response, measured as erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA), was observed during the first 8 h NAP exposure. However, for exposures longer than 8 h, ENA frequency returned to the control levels. This response profile may reflect a considerable DNA repair capacity and/or a metabolic adaptation providing an efficient NAP biotransformation and consequent detoxification. BNF revealed no ENA alterations for all concentrations and exposure lengths. In the NAP experiment a causal relationship between immature erythrocytes (IE) and ENA frequency disappearance was not found. BNF results with regard to IE frequency revealed an ability to alter the balance between erythropoiesis and removal of erythrocytes. Liver glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity was significantly induced after 2 and 48 h NAP exposure. A cortisol-impaired response seems to occur from 4 to 24 h NAP exposure, demonstrating an endocrine disruption. However, an adaptation process seems to occur after 48 hrs, since the plasma cortisol had a tendency to increase. The present findings confirm the\nusefulness of the adopted biomarkers. The ecological risk associated with aquatic contamination by NAP was also confirmed by the present data.\nINTRODUCTION\nA large number of xenobiotic compounds have been produced in the 20th century as a result of petroleum exploitation, with the aquatic environment being the ultimate sink for most of them. Therefore, the vast majority of aquatic animals have become increasingly exposed to industrially derived xenobiotic pollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (George, 1994). These widespread environmental contaminants, originating mainly from combustion processes, oil spills, land runoff, and domestic and industrial wastes, are of international concern due to their persistence in the environment and mutagenic/carcinogenic potential. Naphthalene (NAP), the simplest PAH, is frequently encountered in soil and in aquatic environments (Irwin et al., 1997).\nFish readily take up lipophilic organic contaminants such as NAP from the environment and possess a variety of cellular mechanisms for protection against the deleterious effects of such chemicals (Peters et al., 1997). These mechanisms include biotransformation, which converts organic contaminants to water-soluble and excretable metabolites. However, biotransformation enzymes may also convert certain xenobiotics to intermediates, which are more toxic than the parent compounds. Biotransformation can generally be simply divided into phases I and II: phase I is the alteration of the original foreign molecule so as to add a functional group, which can be conjugated in phase II. Biotransformation studies in fish revealed that PAHs exposure induces cytochrome P450 (P450)-dependent enzymatic activities such as ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation (EROD) (phase I). Therefore, the EROD activity determination has been adopted as a valuable indicator allowing the detection of PAHs at presumably toxic levels.\nA common mechanism for protection against biotransformed electrophilic xenobiotics is conjugation with glutathione (GSH) in phase II detoxification. This\nSome authors have successfully employed aquatic organisms in cytogenetic studies, for chromosome aberrations, sister chromatid exchange, micronuclei (Pesch et al., 1981; Kligerman, 1982) and erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA), which include micronuclei (supernumerary nucleus) and other nuclear abnormalities quantification (Pacheco and Santos, 1997, 2002; Ayllon and Garcia-Vasquez, 2001).\nFish endocrine system can be adversely affected by toxic chemicals. Therefore, biochemical alterations and consequent effects on specific hormonal functions may constitute important stress biomarkers (Hontela, 1997). In this context, changes in interrenal function, measured as plasma cortisol, are recognized as important fish stress biomarkers (Santos and Pacheco, 1996).\nThe toxic effects of NAP in fish have been poorly studied. The first reported studies concern lethality experiments (Boylan and Tripp, 1971; Anderson et al., 1974). Levitan and Taylor (1979) found a general plasma cortisol increase in Fundulus heteroclitus exposed to NAP under different salinities. Both NAP genotoxic potential measured as ENA increase in Dicentrarchus labrax (Gravato and Santos,\n2002)\tand an oxidative stress induction in Anguilla anguilla L. (Ahmad et al., 2001) have been observed.\nP-Naphthoflavone (BNF) has been considered the most potent P450 mixed-function oxydase (MFO) inducer among a number of synthetic flavonoid compounds (McKillop and Case, 1991). This compound is commonly used to evaluate fish biotransformation responses due to its MFOs responses, considered similar to those displayed by PAHs inducers, such as benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) (Okey, 1990; Novi et al., 1998). Thus, in a biotransformation context, BNF is regarded as a PAH-type inducer. Previous investigations with A. anguilla revealed that BNF is a strong EROD inducer both in adult eels intraperitoneally injected (Pacheco and Santos, 1998) and in glass\neels (leptocephalic stage) exposed to BNF-contaminated water (Pacheco and Santos, 1997). McKillop and Case (1991) reviewed the information available relating to BNF mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. Their literature search produced no primary reports on the mutagenicity/carcinogenicity of BNF, suggesting that no definitive study had been carried out specifically to assess these BNF effects. Furthermore, the majority of the studies were carried out in mammals; thus, doubt with regard to its potential in other animal groups remains. Recently, the BNF mutagenicity potential was demonstrated in fish by Pacheco and Santos (1997) who observed a significant ENA increase in glass eels. In this perspective, further fish studies are needed to clarify the BNF genotoxic potential in fish.\nThis research concerns the study of the effects of NAP on liver biotransformation, measured as P450 content, EROD (phase I), and GST activity (phase II), and on genotoxicity, measured as ENA. The immature erythrocytes (IE) frequency was determined to assess changes in the erythropoiesis/erythrocytic catabolism balance and its influence on ENA expression. Liver alanine transaminase (ALT) activity was measured as an indicator of hepatic health condition. The endocrine disruption was evaluated as plasma cortisol concentration.\nAdditionally, BNF was tested as a reference compound for biotransformation parameters (phase I) and to assess its genotoxic potential in fish, as ENA.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nTest Animals\nA. anguilla L. (yellow eel), with an average weight of 30 g (yellow eel), were collected from the Aveiro lagoon, Murtosa. The eels were transported in anoxia and acclimated to laboratory conditions for 1 week prior to experimentation. During recovery and experimental periods, eels were kept in 80-L aquaria at 20\u00b0C under a natural photoperiod, in recirculating, aerated, filtered, and dechlorinated tap water. Fish were fed neither under laboratory adaptation nor during the experimental procedure.\nExperimental Design\nTwo different lots of eels were exposed either to a NAP or a BNF concentration range - 0 (control), 0.1, 0.3, 0.9 and 2.7 pM - for 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 24, 48, and 72 h. The appropriate amount of NAP or BNF was previously dissolved in 1 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and added to the experimental aquaria. The same volume of DMSO was added to the control aquaria. During the exposure time the water was not replaced.\nFish were killed at each sampling point and their blood and liver were collected. Liver was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20\u00b0C until homogenization. Blood was used for smear preparation and for plasma isolation using an Eppendorf centrifuge (14,000 rpm). The following parameters were determined for NAP and BNF experiments with the exceptions of plasma cortisol and liver GST activity which were measured only for the NAP experiment.\nBiochemical Analysis\nLiver EROD Activity\nLiver microsomal fraction was obtained according to the methods of Lange et al. (1992) and Monod and Vindimian (1991), as adapted by Pacheco and Santos (1998). Liver EROD activity was measured in microsome suspension as described by Burke and Mayer (1974).\nLiver Cytochrome P450 Content\nCytochrome P450 content was determined using the dithionite-reduced carbon monoxide difference spectrum between 450 and 490 nm, as previously described by Hermens et al. (1990).\nLiver GST Activity\nGST activity was determined in the cytosolic fraction as described by Lemaire et al. (1996), using CDNB as substrate (Habig et al., 1974). The assay, prepared in the cuvette, was carried out in a 2-mL mixture of 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.2 mM CDNB, and 0.2 mM GSH. The reaction was initiated by addition of 10 pl sample. The increase in absorbance at 340 nm was recorded at 25\u00b0C for 3 min.\nLiver ALT Activity\nThe liver ALT activity was measured in the cytosolic fraction according to the method of Reitman and Frankel (1957).\nProtein measurement\nMicrosomal and cytosolic protein concentrations were determined according to the Biuret method (Gornall et al., 1949) using bovine serum albumin (E. Merck-Darmstadt) as a standard.\nPlasma Cortisol\nPlasma cortisol quantification was performed using a diagnostic enzyme-immunological kit (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH No. 1288946).\nENA Frequency\nGenotoxicity was tested using the ENA assay. The nuclear abnormalities were scored in 1000 mature erythrocytes (ME) per fish, according to the criteria of Schmid (1976), Carrasco et al. (1990), and Smith (1990), adapted by Pacheco and Santos (1996). According to these authors, nuclear lesions were scored into one of the following categories: micronuclei, lobed nuclei, dumbbell-shaped or segmented nuclei, and kidney-shaped nuclei. The final result was expressed as the mean value (%o) of the sum for all the individual lesions observed.\nIE frequency (%) = [No. IE/(No. lE+No. ME)]x1000.\nThe distinction between ME and IE was based on the criteria established by Hibiya (1982) and Smith (1990).\nStatistical Analysis\nMean \u00b1 standard error (SE) was calculated for each experimental group, and data were analyzed for significance of differences between control and exposed groups according to the two-tailed Student t test (Bailey, 1959). Experiments were carried out using test groups of five eels (n=5).\nRESULTS\nNAP Experiment\nLiver EROD Activity\nA significant inhibition in liver EROD activity was observed during the first 6 h exposure (Fig. 1), especially for the highest NAP concentrations. However, a general significant liver EROD increase was detected from 16 to 72 h exposure. The maximum liver EROD activity level (7.06 pmol/min/mg protein) was reached at 48 h exposure to 2.7 pM.\nFig. 1 - A. anguilla liver EROD activity after 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 24, 48, and 72 h exposure to naphthalene (0, 0.1,0.3, 0.9, and 2,7 p.M).

A significant decrease was observed at 16 h exposure to 0.9 and 2.7 liM (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively).\nLiver GST Activity\nThe GST activity demonstrated a significant induction only at 2 (P<0.01) and\n48 h (P<0.001) exposure to 0.9 liM NAP (Fig. 3). However, this concentration induced a general GST increase during the whole experiment.\n5\n\u25a1 Control \u25a10.1 p^DO.3 iiM \u25a0 0.9 pMH 2.7 iiM\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nh 1L\t\t1\n\tu.\t\nExposure Time (hours)\n3\nE\n<D\n2\nFig. 2 - A. anguilla liver P450 content after 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 24, 48, and 72 h exposure to naphthalene (0, 0.1,0.3, 0.9, and 2.7 pM).

Differences from control: *P<0.05; **P<0.01;***P<0.001.\nLiver ALT Activity\nIn general, no significant alterations were observed in liver ALT activity during the whole NAP exposure period (Fig. 4), except for 0.3 pM at 8 h exposure where a significant increase was detected (P<0.05).\nFig. 4 - A. anguilla liver ALT activity after 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 24, 48, and 72 h exposure to naphthalene (0, 0.1,0.3, 0.9, and 2.7 pM).

ENA frequency returned to control levels after exposures longer than 8 h.\nFig. 5 - A. anguilla ENA frequency after 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 24, 48, and 72 h exposure to naphthalene (0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.9, and 2.7 pM).

This tendency was confirmed at 6 h where a significant decrease was observed for 0.1 pM (P<0.05), 0.3 pM (P<0.01), and 0.9 pM (P<0.05). After 48 h the previous tendency disappeared and an opposite trend was observed.\nFig. 6 - A. anguilla IE frequency after 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 24, 48, and 72 h exposure to naphthalene (0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.9, and 2.7 p.M).

Differences from control: *P<0.05; **P<0.01;***P<0.001.\nBNF Experiment\nLiver EROD Activity\nThe A. anguilla response after 2 h exposure suggests an initial inhibition effect which became evident by the complete absence of EROD activity increase and mainly by the significant activity decrease observed for 0.9 liM BNF (P<0.001) (Fig. 8). The first significant EROD increase was observed after 4 h exposure (P<0.05) but just for the lowest BNF concentration (0.1 p.M). During the exposure period between 6 and 72 h, all the concentrations were able to significantly increase EROD activity. For each exposure concentration, a global analysis of EROD results reveals a time-related increase tendency from 2 to 8 h exposure, where it reaches the maximum values.\nFig. 8 - A. anguilla liver EROD activity after 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 24, 48, and 72 h exposure to 0-naphthoflavone (0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.9, and 2.7 p.M).

Differences from control: *P<0.05; **P<0.01;***P<0.001.\nLiver P450 Content\nThis biomarker exhibited a fast significant increase at 2 h 0.1 liM BNF exposure (P<0.01) (Fig. 9). This parameter demonstrated a general tendency to increase at all BNF exposure lengths. However, significant responses were observed only at dispersed points and there was an unclear dose-response relationship. A response profile similar to that described for EROD activity was observed, i.e., the maximum values were obtained after 8 and 16 h exposure, followed by tendency to decline. Similar to the EROD response, an inhibition effect seems to occur in P450 content, particularly for short exposures, as confirmed by a significant decrease observed at 2 h for 0.3 p.M, compared to 0.1 liM (P<0.05). Nevertheless, a decline of this inhibitory action was observed as result of an increased exposure length.\nFig. 9 - A. anguilla liver P450 content after 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 24, 48, and 72 h exposure to 0-naphthoflavone (0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.9, and 2.7 pM).

Differences from control: *P<0.05; **P<0.01;***P<0.001. #P<0.05: 0.1 pM vs 0.3 pM.\nLiver ALT Activity\nThe lowest BNF concentration (0.1 pM) was able to significantly increase ALT activity, as demonstrated at 2 and 24 h exposure (P<0.05) (Fig. 10). However, the highest BNF concentrations were able to induce liver damage sporadically, as it occurred for 0.9 pM at 8 (P<0.05) and 16 h exposure (P<0.01), and for 2.7 pM at 6 (P<0.05) and 16 h (P<0.01) exposure.\nFig. 10 - A. anguilla liver ALT activity after 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 24, 48, and 72 h exposure to 0-naphthoflavone (0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.9, and 2.7 pM). Values represent the means and SE (n=5/treatment). Differences from control: *P<0.05; **P<0.01;***P<0.001.\nENA Frequency\nThe genotoxic response revealed no alterations for all tested concentrations and exposure times (Fig. 11).\nIE Frequency\nThe IE frequency was markedly affected by BNF exposure (Fig. 12). The results revealed significant decreases for 24 h and longer exposures. At some points in time, such as 24 h, a dose-response relationship seems to be evident, i. e., the IE frequency decreases as the BNF dose increases.\nFig. 11 - A. anguilla ENA frequency after 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 24, 48, and 72 h exposure to p-naphthoflavone (0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.9, and 2.7 pM).

Differences from control: *P<0.05; **P<0.01;***P<0.001.\nDISCUSSION\nTo our knowledge there are very few studies on the effects of NAP on biotransformation, genotoxicity, and endocrine parameters in fish.\nIt is well known that xenobiotics classified as PAH-type compounds induce hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450-dependent reactions in fish (Fouchecourt et al., 1999). Measurements of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) and EROD (phase I) activities in fish appear to be the most sensitive means for determining water contamination by PAHs. These phase I enzyme activities occur at low and sometimes undetectable levels in control or untreated fish (Forlin et al., 1994). Several studies have demonstrated liver EROD induction in fish exposed to PAHs such as dibenzo[a]pyrene (Veter et al., 1985) and BaP (Wolkers et al., 1996). Nevertheless, Bols and coworkers (1999) failed to obtain EROD activity induction by NAP in a trout liver cell line.\nThe results of the present study indicated that NAP could modulate the biotransformation metabolism, expressed as liver EROD activity increase. However, compared to the positive control (BNF), NAP induced a later EROD rise (16-72 h).\nDespite the EROD induction potential, the current NAP and BNF results also revealed an inhibitory capacity detected especially for the highest concentrations (0.9 and 2.7 p.M) during the first 6 h NAP exposure and at 2 h BNF exposure (0.9 p.M). This inhibitory effect may be explained by the high xenobiotic exposure concentrations. Previous studies demonstrated that several CYP1A1 inducers could also inhibit the MFO catalytic activity (EROD or AHH) at high concentrations (Stegeman and Hahn, 1994). Such double performance was found in fish exposed, either in vivo or in vitro, to high doses of polychlorinated biphenyl's (PCBs) congeners (Boon et al., 1992; Hahn et al., 1993), BaP (Goddard et al., 1987), and BNF (Haasch et al., 1993). The majority of cythocrome P450 enzyme inhibitors act either by competitive inhibition or by mechanism-based inactivation in which the inhibitor is metabolized by the cythocrome P450 into a product that covalently modifies the active site and thereby inactivates the enzyme (Stegeman and Hahn, 1994). In the present study, EROD activity and P450 content presented a concomitant inhibitory\nThe liver EROD decrease observed during the first 6 h NAP exposure was not followed by a liver ALT decrease. Moreover, liver ALT activity at 8 h exposure to 0.3 liM NAP revealed a significant increase. Thus, the observed EROD activity decrease is not justified by liver lesions.\nLiver EROD induction observed after 16-h NAP and 4-h BNF exposures might be explained by either a progressive fish acclimation and physiological adjustment, reducing the inhibition efficiency, or by a decline of the xenobiotic levels in the aquaria.\nGlobally, the current phase I results proved that liver EROD activity rather than total cytochrome P450 is a good biomarker for PAH and PAH-like compounds exposure, providing an early biological warning signal.\nIncreases in GSH, glutathione reductase and GST levels have been linked to organism resistance and adaptation to a variety of physical and chemical stresses found in the environment (Gallagher et al., 2001). Considering the current NAP results, a liver GST activity tendency to increase was observed from 2 to 72 h, being significantly expressed at 2 and 48 h. GST induction could reflect a stress response to the chemical, resulting in a phase II conjugation process, where the metabolites formed in phase I are combined with endogenous molecules to form conjugates. Nevertheless, it is difficult to establish a direct correspondence between GST, EROD, and P450 content responses.\nIn agreement with our results, a hepatic GST activity increase was previously observed in NAP-treated mice (Mitchell et al., 2000). Additionally, the same response was observed in BaP-treated fish (Lemaire et al., 1992; George, 1994). Some authors suggested that the absence of GST activity variation could be followed by induction of other conjugases, such as UDP-glucoronyl transferase (Novi et al., 1998).\nThe A. anguilla ENA response to both compounds was clearly different. A significant ENA frequency increase from 2 to 8 h exposure to NAP was observed,\ndemonstrating an early genotoxic effect. However, BNF did not reveal any ENA increase for all the exposure durations.\nPAHs mutagenic characteristics are strongly related to their biotransformation, especially the initial oxidative metabolism carried out by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. However, considering the early ENA induction observed in the NAP experiment concomitant to an EROD decrease, it might be suggested that NAP is genotoxic itself, without the need of bioactivation. Since NAP is the simplest PAH, having only two fused aromatic rings, its entrance in the cell is facilitated and a large number of these molecules might rapidly injure the DNA. The increased EROD activity observed from 16 to 72 h NAP exposure coincides with an ENA decline. Furthermore, a significant GST increase occurred at 48 hours exposure. These facts indicate that the phase I activation did not carry negative consequences for erythrocytic DNA and the whole detoxification process (phases I and II) seems to be effective, preventing ENA appearance. This explanation is supported by a previous human study (Tingle et al., 1993) in which liver cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolized NAP to a cytotoxic and protein-reactive, but not genotoxic, metabolite (probably an epoxide). This is rapidly and efficiently detoxified by microsomal epoxide hydrolase forming stable metabolites.\nThe observed NAP genotoxic potential is in agreement with previous results of Gravato and Santos (2002) in Dicentrarchus labrax and Delgado-Rodriguez et al. (1995) in Drosophila melanogaster.\nThe hypothesis presented above for the NAP genotoxic mechanism may also be applicable to the current ENA/EROD results in the BNF experiment, since an EROD induction was observed from 4 to 72 h exposure without a simultaneous ENA response. This is in agreement with the results of Pacheco and Santos (1997) who observed in glass eels an ENA appearance at 6 and 9 days BNF exposure following a time-related tendency to decrease in EROD activity. Additionally, with respect to the previous findings, it must be suggested that longer BNF exposures should be used to assess its genotoxic potential.\nPrevious investigations suggested that the expression of genotoxic effects, such as micronuclei or other ENA, could be masked by a direct erythropoiesis inhibition (Das and Nanda, 1986; Dinnen et al., 1988) and/or by an increased erythrocytic catabolism (Pacheco and Santos, 1997). Alterations in the balance of erythropoiesis/erythrocytic catabolism could be assessed by IE frequency changes. In the NAP experiment a causal relationship between IE frequency and ENA disappearance was not found. However, erythrocytic catabolism needs to be studied. In the BNF experiment IE frequency data indicated an ability to alter the balance between erythropoiesis and erythrocytes removal. Therefore, it was evident that ENA expression from 24 to 72 hours was affected by an IE frequency decrease, becoming more obvious at longer exposures to high BNF doses. Consequently, a causal relationship between the previous disruption observed at 24, 48 and 72 h and the absence of ENA increase may be suggested. If the erythrocytes are not produced or are catabolized more intensely, the ENA appearance can be masked despite the presence of genotoxic metabolites.\nThe endocrine system plays a central role in fish stress mechanisms. Cortisol, in particular, is a crucial hormone in the physiological response to stressors. Previous studies demonstrated that acute exposures to xenobiotics, namely PAHs (Thomas and Rice, 1987), in addition to capture and handling (Vijayan et al., 1997), elevate plasma cortisol. Nevertheless, effects of chronic exposures to pollutants are less well understood (Hontela, 1997). Fish exposed to heavy metals exhibited an initial plasma cortisol rise followed by a decline to control levels (Pratap and Wendelaar, 1990). According to Hontela et al. (1997), fish chronically exposed to PAHs, PCBs, and heavy metals were unable to increase cortisol in response to a capture stress. The authors explained this fact by an exhaustion of the cortisol-producing endocrine system, possibly as a result of its prolonged hyperactivity. Other authors demonstrated that the interrenal function might also be affected by short-term exposures. Eels exposed either to bleached kraft pulp mill effluent for 4 h (Santos and Pacheco, 1996) or to diesel water-soluble fraction during 3 h to 3 days (Pacheco and\nSantos, 2001) exhibited an impairment in the expected plasma cortisol increase, as a response to the stress of capture and handling.\nIn the current study, a cortisol-impaired response seems to occur from 4 to 24 h NAP exposure, demonstrating an interrenal disruption after short-term exposures. However, an adaptation process seems to occur after 48 h NAP exposure, since the plasma cortisol levels revealed a tendency increase in treated fish. These results are in agreement with the findings of Pacheco and Santos (2001) who detected a similar response profile. In opposition, Levitan and Taylor (1979) found a general plasma cortisol increase in F. heteroclitus exposed to 4 mg/L NAP for\n2-12 h. This disagreement may be explained by the use of different fish species and/or by the concentration levels adopted (about 10-fold lower in the current work).\nThere is some evidence that acute exposures could exert adrenal cytotoxicity, impairing the adrenal function and the ability to secrete cortisol (Jonsson, 1994). Nevertheless, if this cytotoxic effect is related to the observed interrenal impairment in the present study, a recovery occurs after 24 h NAP exposure. Further investigations are needed to clarify the mechanisms involved in the cortisol responses, focusing mainly on the inhibitory processes in short-term exposures.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe current results led to the following conclusions:\n(1) Naphthalene (NAP) is an aquatic contaminant, which induces early genotoxic damage in erythrocytes and a later liver ethoxyresorufin O- deethylation (EROD) induction. (2) NAP is a less potent EROD inducer than the positive control (BNF). (3) NAP is more genotoxic than BNF. (4) The increased ENA frequency induced by NAP is not directly related to high EROD activity. Furthermore, ENA seems to be expressed when the detoxification mechanisms are depressed. (5) The adoption of a multibiomarker battery focused on biotranformation, genotoxicity and endocrine levels should be a good biomonitoring strategy, facilitating the understanding of the mechanisms involved in fish toxic responses.\nREFERENCES\nAdams, S.M.

The BNF effects on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (T3), free thyroxine (T4) and cortisol plasma levels were investigated. Alterations on plasma glucose and lactate levels were also measured as an indication of energy-mobilizing hormones alterations. BNF showed to be able to decrease significantly A. anguilla plasma T4 levels, whereas TSH, T3 and cortisol plasma remained constant. However, plasma glucose levels were significantly increased, demonstrating that intermediary metabolism has been affected. These results demonstrate that BNF a PAH-like compound alters the normal functioning of the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis in A. anguilla.\nKeywords: P-Naphthoflavone; Plasma; Endocrine.\nINTRODUCTION\nIn the vast majority of living organisms, the induction of phases I and II biotransformation enzymes is a well-known response to organic xenobiotic exposure. However, the knowledge of the linkage between these activations and other biological functions, namely endocrine regulation, is still a challenge to environmental toxicology. The majority of studies carried out on this subject concern effects on sexual hormones. For instance, p-naphthoflavone (BNF), an aryl-hydrocarbon (AhR) prototype ligand and cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) inducer, demonstrated to impair the systemic hormonal control of reproductive processes by acting both at the hepatic level (vitellogenin production) and at the pituitary-gonad axis (Navas et al., 2004). Nevertheless, the interference of this kind of xenobiotics with nonsexual endocrine responses in fish is still poorly understood.\nPrevious research work concerning mammals showed that typical microsomal enzyme inducers affected thyroid function. Thus, a decrease in plasma thyroxine (T4)\nand triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations, after exposure to phenobarbital,\n3-methylcholanthrene, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and BNF was observed (Vansell and Klaassen, 2002; Hood et al. 2003; Kato et al., 2003). Nevertheless, to our knowledge, there are no studies on fish concerning the effects of this type of chemicals over the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. The information on the effects of microsomal enzyme inducers on corticosteroid hormones is also scarce. According to Wilson et al. (1998), BNF can affect fish pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis since it was demonstrated that it abolishes interrenal sensitivity to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Considering the previous statements, it seems relevant to investigate how chemicals that are not commonly regarded as endocrine disruptors can interfere at hormonal levels.\nHPT and HPI axes play a central role on a wide range of important homeostatic mechanisms in fish. Thyroid hormones regulate growth, and hydromineral balance (Van Anholt et al., 2003), while cortisol is involved in the regulation of energy metabolism, anti-inflammatory response as well as immune competence (Hontela, 1997; Wendelaar Bonga, 1997). Thyroid hormones and cortisol can both interact and influence carbohydrate metabolism (Hontela et al., 1995). Alterations in these hormone plasma concentrations, as well as on glucose and lactate levels can reflect endocrine alterations, reducing fish physiological competence and possibly survivorship. Thus, the previously mentioned parameters can also be usefull tools on monitoring the impact of anthropogenic stressors in fish.\nPrevious studies have been performed with Anguilla anguilla concerning the effects of different xenobiotics on plasma cortisol, glucose and lactate levels (Santos et al., 1990, 1992, 1993, 1996; Pacheco and Santos, 2001; Teles et al., 2003a, b).\nThe choice of A. anguilla L. as test organism was based on its well-known resistance and sensitivity in the presence of adverse conditions making it a good option as an aquatic biological model for sublethal toxicological studies. A significant knowledge of eel's physiology was achieved by previous works namely those carried out in our laboratory. Moreover, the responses of A. anguilla to BNF in terms of biotransformation responses were extensively studied as an increase in microsomal\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nChemicals\nP-Naphthoflavone (BNF), p-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (P-NAD), L-lactic dehydrogenase, and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase were purchased from Sigma (USA). All the other chemicals were of analytical grade.\nBiochemical Analysis\nThe determination of cortisol, TSH, T3 and T4 were performed in plasma, using diagnostic ELISA direct immunoenzymatic kits (Diametra, Italy). The absorbance in each well was measured at 450 nm in a microplate reader (ASYS Hitech).\nThe cortisol in the sample competes with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-cortisol for binding onto the limited number of anti-cortisol sites in the microplate wells. The enzyme substrate (H2O2) and the TMB-substrate (TMB) are added, and after an appropriate time has elapsed for maximum color development, the enzyme reaction is stopped and the absorbances are determined. Cortisol concentration in the sample is calculated based on a series of standards and the color intensity is inversely proportional to the cortisol concentration in the sample.\nThe methods for free T3 and free T4 follow the same principles of the cortisol test, requiring immobilized T3 or T4 antibodies, as well as HRP-T3 or HRP-T4 conjugates.\nConcerning TSH, an antibody specific to the p-chain of TSH molecule is immobilized on microwell plates and other antibodies to the TSH molecule are\nTest Animals\nThe experiment was carried out using A. anguilla (European eel) collected from the Aveiro lagoon area - Murtosa, Portugal. The eels with a 25\u00b13 cm (yellow eel) average length and weighing 30\u00b15 g were acclimated to laboratory conditions in aerated (dissolved oxygen: 7.6+0.3 mg/L), filtered, dechlorinated tap water with pH 7.2+0.4, under a natural photoperiod at 20 \u00b0C, for 1 week prior to experimentation. Fish were neither fed under laboratory adaptation nor during the experimental procedure. The experiment was carried out in 20 L aquaria under the previous conditions.\nExperimental Design\nThe eels were exposed to BNF 2.7 pM during 24 and 48 h. The appropriate amount of BNF was previously dissolved in 1 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and added to the experimental aquaria. The same volume of DMSO was added to the control aquaria. Fish blood was collected from the posterior cardinal vein using a heparinized Pasteur pipette and its plasma isolated using an Eppendorf centrifuge, 14,000 rpm during 5 min. Experiments were carried out using test groups of five eels (n=5). The BNF concentration and exposure time adopted were based on a previous study with same species, where a significant increase in liver EROD activity was observed (Teles etal., 2003b).\nStatistical Analysis\nMean\u00b1standard error (S.E.) was calculated for each experimental group, and data were analyzed for significance of differences between control and exposed groups according to the two-tailed Student's t-test (Bailey, 1959). Experiments were carried out using test groups of five eels (n=5). Differences between means were considered significant when P<0.05.\nRESULTS\nHormonal Responses\nA. anguilla plasma T4 was significantly decreased after 24- and 48-h exposure to BNF 2.7 liM when compared to the control. The plasma T4 decrease was time-related since a 2.5- and 5.1-fold decrease was, respectively, detected after 24 and 48 h. However, BNF did not induce any significant alteration on plasma cortisol, TSH and T3 concentrations (Fig. 1).\nIntermediary Metabolism Responses\nA. anguilla plasma glucose concentration significantly increased after 24- and 48-h BNF exposure. A 2.4-fold increase was observed after 24 h, while after 48-h exposure the increase was 4.3-fold. On the other hand, plasma lactate was not significantly altered (Fig. 2).\nExposure Time (hours)\nFig. 1 - Plasmatic concentrations of TSH (A), free T3 (B), T4 (C) and cortisol (D) after 24 and 48 h of exposure to BNF 2.7 pM.

To our knowledge, no studies were performed on this issue concerning fish. Current results revealed decreased A. anguilla plasma T4 levels after exposure to BNF, confirming the data previously obtained with mammals. This similarity is not surprising considering that the morphofunctional organization of the thyroid gland is similar in fishes and in rats (Kornienko and Kozhin, 1997).\nA wide range of mechanisms can be implicated in the xenobiotic-induced alterations of plasma thyroid hormones, corresponding to changes on thyroid status and/or alterations upstream or downstream the hormone production. These mechanisms include alterations on the: (i) hypothalamus and/or pituitary status (Alkindi et al., 1996), (ii) biosynthesis and secretion steps of T3 and T4 (Capen, 1997), (iii) uptake by peripheral tissues, (iv) hepatic 5'-monodeiodinase activity (Waring et al., 1996), or (v) hormone catabolism and clearance rates (Saito et al., 1991; Hontela et al., 1995). Among all the possible mechanisms involved in plasma T4 decrease following liver microsomal enzyme inducers exposure, it has been frequently proposed that UDP-glucuronyl-transferase (UDP-GT) inducers can increase T4 glucuronidation and biliary excretion (mechanism v), reducing plasma T4 concentration (McClain, 1992; Johnson et al., 1993; Liu et al., 1995). In fact, it was demonstrated that BNF induces liver UDP-GT activity in Dicentrarchus labrax (Novi et al., 1998; Gravato and Santos, 2002). Thus, besides the similarity between mammals and fish responses, a mechanism resemblance can also be proposed, applying the previous explanation to the current responses observed in A. anguilla. Plasma T3 concentrations were unaffected by the current BNF fish treatment, which is consistent with the effects of other hepatic microsomal enzyme inducers on plasma T3 levels in rats (Hood et al., 1999, 2003; Liu et al., 1995). The ability to maintain plasma T3 concentrations is stronger than the ability to maintain T4 levels (Hood et al., 2003), probably due to an activation of homeostatic mechanisms, such as increased synthesis of T3 by the thyroid or by extra-thyroidal tissues (5'monodeiodinase activity increase), recovery of T3 from T3-SO4 by sulfatases, and increased enterohepatic circulation (Alkindi et al., 1996; Hood et al., 2003). According to Sapin and Schlienger (2003), plasma T3 is a less reliable reflection of thyroid hormone production than T4 since most of circulating T3 (around 80%) is produced extrathyroidally from T4 deiodination.\nIn response to reduced plasma T4, an increase in plasma TSH would be expected; however, in the present study plasma TSH levels remained unaltered. Previous studies concerning mammals exposed to microsomal enzyme inducers\nPrevious fish studies (Anderson et al., 1996; Navas et al., 2004) suggested a disruptive action of BNF upon the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis through the disappearance of the negative feedback control on pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) release, explained through its absence of effect on estrogen receptors (ER) at the pituitary and hypothalamus level. Considering the current data, the occurrence of alterations on thyroid hormone receptors (TR) at the hypothalamus/pituitary level is not excluded; though it cannot be adopted as an explanation for the absence of any TSH response to plasma T4 depression. Additionally, an alteration on thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) receptors at pituitary cells could also be suggested.\nThyroid hormones deiodination, conjugation as well as transport and their receptors interaction, besides measuring its plasma levels, should also be evaluated in order for a better understanding of the HPT axis dynamic, following xenobiotic exposure.\nFish respond to stress with characteristic acute increases in plasmatic levels of catecholamines, and slower but more sustained increases in plasmatic levels of the corticosteroid cortisol (Grutter and Pankhurst, 2000). Thus, alterations on the levels of plasma cortisol could provide valuable information on the fish stress condition. BNF is a potent cytochrome P450 1A inducer in fish tissues, including interrenal (Husoy et al., 1994). CYP1A1 isozyme of fish does not catalyze oxidative metabolism of cortisol; however, CYP1A1 inducing compounds may interfere with steroid plasma levels through different mechanisms namely the increase of phase II conjugation of steroids, as suggested by Forlin and Haux (1985) for the effects of BNF on p-estradiol levels.\nFurthermore, according to Wilson et al. (1998) a BNF interference on steroid biosynthetic pathways through a substrate competition or alterations on key mitochondrial enzymes involved in cortisol synthesis would be expectable, resulting in lower cortisol production. However, the present results did not confirm this hypothesis\nA previous study concerning D. labrax exposure to BNF 0.9 liM during 24 h revealed no plasma cortisol alteration (Teles et al., 2004). In addition, no changes were found, after BNF injection, in Oncorhynchus mykiss plasma cortisol concentration, despite the ACTH interrenal sensitivity abolishment demonstration (Wilson et al., 1998). The authors suggested that the ability of BNF-treated fish to normally increase plasma cortisol concentration could be due to other hormonal pathways, in addition to ACTH sensitivity abolishment, as well as alterations in the plasma cortisol clearance rate. Therefore, the absence of significant plasma cortisol alterations cannot ensure that the cortisol dynamics was unaffected, remaining the possibility alterations of HPI axis as well as plasma cortisol uptake by the target cells.\nIn the present study, plasma glucose increased after BNF exposure, despite the unaltered plasma cortisol and lactate levels. Vijayan et al. (1997) stated that besides interrenal cortisol release, other mechanisms might be controlling glucose availability in fish. Moreover, under acute stress catecholamines could be rapidly released resulting in increased glycogenolysis. However, this explanation cannot be applied to the current glucose response, since the persistence of catecholamine effects up to 48 h is not likely. Van der Boon et al. (1991) stated that the influence of plasma cortisol on fish carbohydrate metabolism is not very comprehensive and thus the establishment of a consistent relation between plasma cortisol, glucose and lactate seems difficult. However, the authors suggest that the current plasma glucose increase observed following BNF exposure may be related to an increased liver gluconeogenesis induced by the previously uptaken plasma cortisol.\nPlasma T4 frequently follows a response pattern similar to that one of plasma cortisol, and T4 may also activate the interrenal function (Hontela et al., 1995). On the\nFinally, the present results confirm the studied parameters as important biomonitoring tools to assess the presence of stressors in aquatic environment contributing to a broader knowledge of fish responses as integration at different physiological levels. Moreover, these findings highlight the need of a careful interpretation of field data, since the occurrence of sequential or simultaneous exposures to different classes of chemicals is likely.\nCONCLUSIONS\n-\tA. anguilla displayed a significant decrease in plasma T4 levels after BNF exposure, revealing a similarity with the known mammal responses. These results demonstrate that typical microsomal enzyme inducers, namely BNF, can also interfere with neuroendocrine processes.\n-\tBNF affected the intermediary metabolism since plasma glucose levels were significantly increased; however, it seems difficult to establish a correlation between cortisol, thyroid hormones and carbohydrate metabolism.\n-\tIn the future, it would be of interest assess thyroid hormones conjugation and deconjugation processes.\n-\tThe above results confirm the studied parameters as important biomonitoring tools to assess the presence of stressors in aquatic environment, providing significant information related to fish intermediary metabolism and endocrine responses to complex environmental mixtures.\nACKOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors express their appreciation for the financial support provided by the Aveiro University Research Institute (CESAM) and by the \u201cFunda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia\u201d (FCT - Grant n\u00b0 SFRH/BD/6607/2001).\nAnderson, M.J.; Olsen, H.; Matsumura, F.; Hinton, D.E.

Teles, M.A. Santos e M. Pacheco (2006)\nEnvironmental International 32, 470-477.\nABSTRACT\nThe effects of 170-estradiol (E2) on fish became a matter of concern, since significant levels of this hormone were detected in the aquatic environment released mainly by domestic sewage treatment plants. In this perspective, the current study was focused on E2 effects upon biotransformation, stress and genotoxic responses of juvenile Dicentrarchus labrax L. (sea bass). Fish were exposed to E2 during 10 days in two different ways: water diluted (200 ng/L or 2000 ng/L) and i.p. injected (0.5 mg/Kg or 5 mg/Kg). A battery of biological responses was evaluated: liver ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and alanine transaminase (ALT) activities, liver somatic index (LSI), plasma cortisol, glucose and lactate concentrations, as well as erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA).\nAll the exposure conditions induced endocrine disruption, measured as plasma cortisol decrease, and genotoxicity, measured as ENA increase. Thus, no differences were detected either between different exposure routes or tested concentrations. Concerning liver EROD and ALT activities, as well as plasma glucose and lactate concentrations no differences were found between treated and control groups. LSI was the only parameter to respond differently in the two exposure routes, as only E2 water diluted induced a significant increase in this hepatic indicator.\nKeywords: 170-Estradiol; Dicentrarchus labrax L.; Biotransformation; Stress Responses; Genotoxicity.\nINTRODUCTION\nNatural female estrogens are excreted via bile and urine mainly as watersoluble glucuronides, sulfates or, to a minor extent, in its free form (Furhacker et al., 1999). Before conjugation, estrogens undergo hydroxylation, reduction, methylation or oxidation predominantly in the liver. 170-Estradiol (E2), the most effective estrogen secreted by the ovaries, can be oxidized to estrone and further converted into estriol.\nEstrogens and E2 in particular reach aquatic environments mainly through domestic effluents. Previous measurements of human estrogen excretion estimated that females were excreting 2.3-259 ^g/person/day and males 1.6 p,g/person/day of E2 through urine (Johnson et al., 2000). Two other important sources of E2 are livestock waste (Ying et al., 2002) and agriculture runoff (C\u00e9spedes et al., 2004). For example, in poultry waste a concentration ranging from 14 to 533 ng/g dry waste for E2 was reported by Shore et al. (1995). The E2 concentration in urine of cattle was found to be 13 ng/L on average (Erb et al., 1977). Recent studies have shown that the utilization of animal manure to agricultural land can lead to movement of E2 into surface and ground water (Peterson et al., 2001). E2 has been found mobile and detected in runoff from a pastural land in an average concentration of 3500 ng/L (Nichols et al., 1998). Therefore, in environmental waters E2 concentration range is between the detection limit up to ng/L (Spengler et al., 2001).\nAlthough E2 conjugates released into aquatic environments do not possess a direct biological activity, they can act as precursor hormone reservoirs able to be reconverted by bacteria to free E2. Moreover, this cleavage is particular relevant in both raw and treated sewages (Baronti et al., 2000).\nTaking into consideration the scenario previously described, E2 has been increasingly reported as an environmental contaminant (Ying et al., 2002; Imai et al., 2005), being also regarded by Dorabawila and Gupta (2005) as \u201cthe most potent of all xenoestrogens\u201d, able to affect aquatic organisms, namely fish. Furthermore, E2 is among the most potent endocrine disrupting chemicals having the potential to exert effects at extremely low concentrations (Bowman etal., 2002).\nStudies regarding E2 effects on fish have been focused on endocrine aspects, mainly reproduction. It is known that it may alter gonadosomatic index in males, reduce egg production in females, induce vitellogenesis in males and juveniles as well as decrease fertility (Mills et al., 2001; Kang et al., 2002). However, there is now ample evidence that non-reproductive endocrine events can be disrupted by E2,\nnamely the response to stress. Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, are important for stress responses in fish, particularly in metabolic adjustments by the regulation of energy production, hydro-mineral balance, oxygen uptake and immune competence (Hontela, 1997). Nevertheless, only a few studies have been carried out on E2 effects on plasma cortisol, leading to non-coincident results (Pottinger et al., 1996; Teles et al., 2005). Similarly, the effects of E2 on fish secondary stress responses, such as alterations on plasma glucose and lactate concentrations, are still poorly understood (Petersen et al., 1983; Teles et al., 2005).\nIn the field of non-endocrine E2 effects on fish, special attention has been paid on regulation of CYP1A expression; hence, several authors observed the suppression of CYP1A-associated 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, in both maturing females Scophthalmus maximus L. and juvenile Sparus aurata L. treated experimentally with E2 (Arukwe and Goksoyr, 1997; Teles et al., 2005). Moreover, several mammal studies indicated that E2 is genotoxic (Liehr, 2000; Joosten et al.,\n2004). Thus, the ecotoxicological relevance of E2 genotoxicity on fish is worthwhile to study since little is known about this subject.\nThe present study was undertaken to assess E2 effects on Dicentrarchus labrax L. (sea bass) at different levels: CYP1A expression, measured as liver EROD activity, genotoxicity, measured as erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA), as well as stress responses, namely plasma cortisol, glucose and lactate levels. Hepatic indicators, such as liver somatic index (LSI) and alanine transaminase (ALT) activity were also measured. Furthermore, the previous responses were evaluated under two different E2 exposure routes, i.e., either water diluted or intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected, in order to clarify the influence of the exposure route.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nChemicals\n170-Estradiol was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany), marine salt from Sera Premium (France). The kit for cortisol determination was obtained from\nTest animals\nThe experiment was carried out with juvenile D. labrax specimens purchased from a local fish farm, Materaqua - ilhavo, Portugal. Fish weighing 21.80\u00b11.32 g and measuring 12.4\u00b13 cm were transported in aerated water and acclimated to laboratory conditions for 1 week prior to experimentation. During acclimatization and experimental periods fish were kept in 80 L aquaria, at 20\u00b0C in aerated (dissolved oxygen: 7.3\u00b10.4 mg/L) and filtered artificial seawater (34 g/L), with a pH of 8.4\u00b10.3. Fish were neither fed under laboratory adaptation nor during the experimental period.\nExperimental design\nThis study includes two experiments, corresponding to two different E2 exposures routes - water diluted (WD) and i.p. injection (IP).\nIn WD experiment, fish were exposed to water diluted E2 at the concentrations of 200 ng/L (0.734 nM) or 2000 ng/L (7.34 nM). The appropriate amount of E2 was previously dissolved in 1 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and added to the experimental aquaria to reach the previous initial nominal concentrations. The same E2 amount was daily added to the experimental aquaria, without water renewal. This procedure was adopted, since it was previously observed that a 4000 ng/L E2 water concentration suffered a 99 % reduction 4 h after addition (Teles et al., 2005). DMSO (1 mL) was also daily added to the control aquarium.\nIn the IP experiment, fish were initially treated with a single E2 i.p. injection, using corn-oil as a carrier and two doses - 0.5 mg/Kg and 5 mg/Kg - were tested. Control fish were also i.p. injected with corn-oil alone.\nBoth experiments were performed with an exposure length of 10 days using test groups of five fish (n=5). Blood was collected from the posterior cardinal vein using a Pasteur pipette with heparin. Following blood sampling, fish were sacrificed by decapitation and its liver sampled. Liver was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen\nBiochemical analysis\nLiver EROD activity\nThe liver EROD activity was measured in microsome suspension as described by Burke and Mayer (1974) and adapted by Pacheco and Santos (1998). The reaction was carried out, at 25\u00b0C, in the fluorometer cuvette containing 1 mL 0.5 pM ethoxyresorufin (in 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.4, containing 0.15 M KCl and 20% glycerol) and 25 pL of microsomal suspension. The reaction was initiated by adding 10 pL of NADPH (10 mM) and the progressive increase in fluorescence, resulting from the resorufin formation, was measured for 3 min (excitation wavelength 530 nm, emission wavelength 585 nm). EROD-activity was expressed as picomoles per minute per milligram of microsomal protein.\nLiver ALT activity\nALT activity was measured, in the supernatant resulting from microsomal isolation, according to a colorimetric method based on the measurement of the pyruvate produced by the transamination reaction (Reitman and Frankel, 1957).\nProtein measurement\nMicrosomal and cytosolic protein concentrations were determined according to the Biuret method (Gornal et al., 1949) using bovine serum albumin as a standard.\nPlasma cortisol, glucose and lactate measurement\nThe cortisol determination was performed using a Diametra (Italy) kit. Briefly, cortisol in the sample competes with horseradish peroxidase-cortisol for binding onto the limited number of anti-cortisol sites in the microplate. Cortisol concentration, measured spectrophotometrically (450 nm), is calculated based on a series of\nPlasma glucose was measured spectrophotometrically (340 nm) according to the method modified from Banauch et al. (1975) based on the quantification of NADH after a glucose oxidation catalysed by the glucose-dehydrogenase. The quantity of NADH formed is proportional to the glucose concentration.\nPlasma lactate levels were determined spectrophotometrically (340 nm) according to the method modified from Noll (1974) using lactate-dehydrogenase, ALT and NAD, measuring the NADH appearance.\nLiver somatic index\nLSI results were presented as a percentage, resulting from the following expression: [liver mass (g)/body mass (g)]x100.\nErythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA) assay\nThe blood smears were fixed with methanol during 10 min and stained with Giemsa (5%) during 30 min. In order to evaluate genotoxicity, the erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities were scored in 1000 mature erythrocytes sample per fish, according to the criteria of Schmid (1976), Carrasco et al. (1990) and Smith (1990), adapted by Pacheco and Santos (1996). According to these authors, nuclear lesions were scored into one of the following categories: micronuclei (a supernumerary nuclear structure within the cytoplasm), lobed nuclei (nuclei with evaginations, ranging from single swellings of the nuclear surface to the presence of multiple lobes), dumbbell shaped or segmented nuclei (two lobes are present as a consequence of a central and bilateral constriction) and kidney shaped nuclei (nuclei with a central and unilateral constriction). The final result was expressed as the mean value (%o) of the sum for all the individual lesions observed.\nMicronuclei are expressed in dividing cells that either contain chromossome breaks lacking centromeres (acentric fragments) and/or whole chromossomes that\nare unable to travel to the spindle poles during mitosis. At telophase, a nuclear envelope forms around the lagging chromossomes and fragments, which then uncoil and gradually assume the morphology of an interphase nucleus with the exception that they are smaller than the main nuclei in the cell, hence the term \u201cmicronucleus\u201d. Micronuclei, therefore, provide a convenient and reliable index of both chromossome breakage and chromossome loss (Fenech, 2000). It is assumed that the other nuclear abnormalities express DNA damaging events similar to those described for micronuclei formation.\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistica software (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK) was used for statistical analyses. All the data were first tested for normality and homogeneity of variance to meet statistical demands. ANOVA analysis was used to compare results between fish groups, followed by LSD test (Zar, 1996). Differences between means were considered significant when P&lt;0.05.\nRESULTS\nD. labrax liver EROD (Fig. 1) and ALT (Fig. 2A) activities showed no statistically significant changes for both water diluted (WD) and intraperitoneal injection (IP) experiments, comparing to the respective control groups.\nLSI (Fig. 2B) increased significantly in D. labrax exposed to water diluted E2 in both tested concentrations, displaying a less pronounced rise for the highest concentration - 72 % increment for 200 ng/L vs. 25 % for 2000 ng/L. On the other hand, no significant alterations were observed in the LSI of i.p. injected fish.\nc\n0\n2\nQ.

However, their occurrence in natural waters strongly increased in the last decades due to its growing use in human medicine and livestock farming release, becoming a matter of concern and an interesting research topic for ecotoxicology.\nThe highest concentration (2000 ng/L) employed in the current WD experiment was chosen to mimic endogenous levels of circulating estrogen in fish spawning females, whereas the lowest concentration (200 ng/L) was chosen according to the highest concentrations found in the aquatic environment, as previously reported by Bowman et al. (2000). On the other hand, the doses adopted in the IP experiment\nBiotransformation Response\nThe CYP1A subfamily normally is expressed in fish at low levels in the absence of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists. These basal levels can be depressed by non-AhR agonists as it was demonstrated for E2 in Oncorhynchus mykiss (Navas and Segner, 2000; Elskus, 2004) and S. aurata (Teles et al., 2005). In general, an enzyme activity inhibition can be achieved either by an interaction at the gene transcription level or by a direct competitive or non-competitive interaction of the tested chemicals with the enzyme molecule (Navas and Segner, 2000). The ability of steroids to bind to the CYP1A molecule acting as EROD activity competitive inhibitors was well established (Chan and Hollebone, 1995). Furthermore, Navas and Segner (2001) found that E2 mediated suppression of CYP1A is at least not restricted to the enzyme catalytic level but occurs also at the pretranslational level.\nThe results of the present study indicated that E2 was not able to suppress the constitutive CYP1A-associated EROD activity in D. labrax. Considering the findings of Navas and Segner (2000), Elskus (2004) and Teles et al. (2005), the current unaltered EROD levels can be surprising; though, they agree with our previous findings concerning the same species, where it was also found unaltered EROD activity in fish exposed to 36,000 ng/L of E2 during 24 h (Teles et al., 2004).\nConsidering the existing literature and the present results, a dependence on the tested species seems to exist, justifying further comparative studies in order to better understand the E2 effects on CYP1A expression.\nHepatic Condition Indicators\nThe LSI increase under WD exposure suggests an altered metabolic state. Though, in a previous study with the same species no LSI alterations were found after 24 h exposure to 36,000 ng/L of E2 (Teles et al., 2004). This difference might be related mainly with the exposure length. On the other hand, an LSI increase was observed in juvenile S. aurata exposed during 16 h to 4000 ng E2/L (Teles et al.,\n2005)\tand in Oryzias javanicus exposed to 243 ng E2/L during 6 months (Imai et al., 2005). Verslycke et al. (2002) suggested that the liver weight increase observed after E2 exposure may be related with a stimulation of hepatic vitellogenin synthesis.\nD. labrax i.p. exposed to E2 behaved differently from the WD E2 exposed fish, since no LSI alterations were found for any of the tested doses. The results are different from a previous study where Paralichthys dentatus injected with 2 and 20 mg/Kg during 4 weeks exhibited an increased LSI, coincident with a plasma vitellogenin increase (Mills et al., 2001).\nLiver ALT activity was not altered in any of the performed experiments; these results are in agreement with a previous study where S. aurata exposed to E2 had unaltered ALT activity (Teles et al., 2005).\nStress Responses\nPlasma cortisol increase is a typical fish response to short-term exposure to stressors. This hormonal increase is commonly followed by a rise in plasma glucose and lactate concentrations (Hontela, 1997). Nevertheless, fish responses to stressors demonstrated to be more complex, since different patterns of response have been observed either concerning the cortisol variation (Santos and Pacheco, 1996; Pacheco and Santos, 2001; Benguira et al., 2002; Teles et al., 2003) or its relation with the secondary stress responses (Teles et al., 2003, 2005).\nThe present results revealed a plasma cortisol decrease suggesting a concentration-dependent response for both E2 exposure routes. Despite the scarcity of fish studies on cortisol alterations after E2 exposure, this kind of response is not\nA plasma cortisol decrease may indicate the occurrence of an endocrine impairment, preventing the animal to respond to the stress of capture and handling or alternatively, may represent a reduction in baseline levels of plasma cortisol. Different explanations were previously presented for the decrease of circulating cortisol. Santos and Pacheco (1996) proposed a chemical induced impairment on interrenal cortisol release, since an accumulation of cortisol was found in this tissue in parallel with a low plasma cortisol concentration. Alternatively, an in vitro incubation experiment using interrenal salmonid tissue demonstrated that E2 suppressed the interrenal cells ability of using pregnenolone as a substrate for cortisol synthesis, and reduced interrenal response to ACTH through a post-receptor cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-mediated steroidogenesis (McQuillan et al., 2003). Moreover, it can be suggested that E2 might affect the cortisol levels in plasma through its fast clearance as demonstrated in an early work with O. nerka for androgens (Donaldson and Fagerlund, 1970).\nOther studies with fish short-term exposed to E2 showed divergent results. Salmonids exposed to E2 had elevated levels of plasma ACTH and cortisol (Pottinger et al., 1996). Unaltered cortisol levels were observed in D. labrax water exposed (Teles et al., 2004), as well as in i.p. injected Oreochromis mossambicus (Vijayan et al., 2001) and Salmo salar (McCormick et al., 2005).\nConsidering the number of studies where a plasma cortisol decrease was found, following short-term exposures either to E2 or other classes of chemicals (Pacheco and Santos, 2001; Teles et al., 2003, 2005), this response should be regarded as a new a pattern of response to short-term exposures to stressors.\nThe biological significance of the observed plasma cortisol decrease may be a reduced fish physiological competence as survivorship and growth since this hormone is required for a wide range of important homeostatic mechanisms.\nConcerning the current intermediary metabolism data, plasma glucose and lactate levels remained unaltered after E2 exposure, for both exposure routes. A\nprevious study with the same species exposed to 36,000 ng E2/L during 24 h detected a significant glucose increase (Teles et al., 2004); this discrepancy may be explained by the difference on tested concentrations and/or exposure length. Teles et al. (2005) also found unchanged levels of plasma glucose in S. aurata exposed to E2, while lactate was significantly increased. On the other hand, Washburn et al. (1993) measured a decrease in plasma glucose concentration in O. mykiss E2-exposed. Taking into account the available data on E2 effects over plasma glucose and lactate concentrations, a considerable unpredictability of these fish responses, depending on the species and experimental protocol is evident. The absence of glucose and lactate changes in the present study can be expected, as a concomitant plasma cortisol decrease was observed. Moreover, Washburn et al. (1993) detected a gluconeogenesis depression in O. mykiss E2 exposed.\nGenotoxic Response\nAccording to Joosten et al. (2004) among the hormonal steroids, estrogens take the head position with respect to incidence of positive outcome of genotoxicity in mammals. E2, in particular, was classified as a carcinogen class I by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) (1999). This hormone caused various types of DNA damage including permanent genetic changes in mammals, that may have relevance for carcinogenesis (Liehr, 2000). Hence, an E2-induced increment of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE), DNA adducts, polyploidy or aneuploidy was observed (Joosten et al., 2004). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that E2 itself can link to DNA and proteins inducing DNA single strand breaks (Han and Liehr, 1994) and micronuclei (Yared et al., 2002). A different picture showing negative results was observed in Ames and chromosome aberration tests (Joosten et al., 2004).\nMammal studies demonstrated that besides the parental hormone, E2 metabolites may act at gene and/or chromosome levels (Roy and Liehr, 1999). Potentially carcinogenic metabolites include catechol estrogens such as 16a-hydroxyestrone, 4-hydroxyestrone and 4-hydroxyestradiol. 4-Hydroxyestradiol, in particular, can undergo metabolic redox cycling generating mutagenic free radicals\nTaking into account the above results in mammals and the E2 concentrations detected in the aquatic environment, it arise an important question about the E2 genotoxic effects on fish. However, only a few studies were carried out in this context. Experiments performed with D. labrax (Teles et al., 2004) and S. aurata (Teles et al., 2005) did not confirm the E2 genotoxicity, measured as ENA frequency, after shortterm exposure. However, considering the ENA increasing tendency observed for 24 h D. labrax exposure, the authors suggested the need to perform longer exposures to obtain conclusive results.\nIt was observed that the most prominent estrogen metabolites in fish are 2-hydroxyestradiol and estrone (Snowberger and Stegeman, 1987; Stein et al., 1991; Butala et al., 2004). Nevertheless, Butala et al. (2004) detected formation of both 2-and 4- hydroxyestradiol in fish liver. Considering the genotoxicity of the previous E2 metabolites demonstrated in mammals, these studies corroborate the E2 genotoxic potential in fish.\nPresent results showed an ENA increase induced by E2 in D. labrax for both exposure routes and both concentrations. These results clearly demonstrate the E2 genotoxicity, reinforcing the hypothesis previously presented by Teles et al. (2004).\nThe correlation between genotoxicity and CYP1A expression is generally based on the assumption that CYP1A induction can potentiate the genotoxic properties of the xenobiotics. Considering that the expectable effect of E2 on CYP1A expression would be its down-regulation, the correlation between EROD activity and ENA increase is less relevant. Moreover, the hypothesis of CYP1A down-regulation by E2 was not confirmed in the present study.\nThe direct or indirect effects of stress can render fish more vulnerable to genotoxins. However, considering present results, i.e., plasma cortisol decrease and unaltered plasma glucose and lactate levels, no correlation could be established between a stress induction and the observed genotoxic effects.\nCONCLUSIONS\n-\tThe comparison between the responses to the different E2 exposure routes revealed no differences for all the assessed parameters, excluding LSI. Thus, it may be suggested that E2 distribution and/or elimination processes seem not to be affected.\n-\tE2 decreased plasma cortisol levels, revealing its endocrine disruptive role affecting fish stress responsiveness. This alteration was confirmed as a possible response pattern to xenobiotics short-term exposures.\n-\tE2, considered an aquatic contaminant, induced genetic damage in D. labrax since an ENA frequency increase was observed for both exposure routes and all tested concentrations.\nACKOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors express their appreciation for the financial support provided by the Aveiro University Research Institute (CESAM) and by the \u201cFunda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia\u201d (FCT grant no.

The present study concerns the 10 days exposure of immature Dicentrarchus labrax L. (sea bass) either to water diluted (WD, 200 or 2,000 ng/L) or intraperitoneally injected (IP, 0.5 or 5 mg/kg) E2 in order to investigate its uptake and resulting vitellogenesis induction, measured as E2 and vitellogenin (Vtg) plasma levels, respectively. Thus, E2 plasma levels were significantly increased only in WD exposure for both tested concentrations, whereas plasma Vtg increased for the highest concentrations in both experiments. These results demonstrated that both exposure routes were able to induce vitellogenesis in immature sea bass and that an E2-induced increase in plasma Vtg could be found without a concomitant increase in plasma levels of E2. Based on environmental realistic concentrations used, these results confirm that environmental exposures to E2 may represent an important risk mainly to juvenile fish, namely due to the adverse consequences of an abnormal Vtg production.\nKeywords: Dicentrarchus labrax; 170-Estradiol; Vitellogenin; Endocrine disruption.\nINTRODUCTION\nDuring the last decades, a great concern has been raised regarding the possible harmful effects of certain chemicals, both synthetic and natural, upon wildlife modulating and/or disrupting the endocrine system - the so-called endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs).\nParticular attention has been paid to persistent environmental contaminants that mimic the effects of the female steroid hormone 170-estradiol (E2) -xenoestrogens - namely organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls and their hydroxylated metabolites, alkyphenols and a few phthalates (Witters et al.,\n2001). However, it is becoming clear that excessive inputs of natural estrogens into\nsurface waters can be responsible for endocrine disruption in wildlife, namely fish (Schultz et al., 2001). For example, female hormones excreted by women and other animals are ubiquitous in aquatic environments receiving sewage inputs (Bowman et al., 2002). Therefore, E2 and estrone are included in a preliminary list of priority substances for which endocrine-disrupting characteristic have been reported (L\u00f3pez de Alda and Barcel\u00f3, 2001). These naturally-occurring estrogens are found in environmental waters at very low concentrations (low ng/L) compared to other EDCs arising mainly from industrial discharges that are often present at pg/L levels. In fact, despite the significantly lower concentrations of the natural estrogens they may have a more important ecotoxicological impact due to their high estrogenic potency and prevalence in the aquatic environment (L\u00f3pez de Alda and Barcel\u00f3, 2001).\nTaking into account several studies conducted to assess the estrogenic activity of different EDCs, E2 was considered one of the strongest estrogenic chemicals in the environment (Purdom et al., 1994; Hansen et al., 1998; Van den Belt et al., 2004), reinforcing the need for E2 reproductive toxicity assessment. The E2 presence in the environment has received little attention until recently, although as a natural hormone excreted mainly in the urine of mammals, it has always been present. Through the years E2 levels increased steadily in the water, as a result of the continuously growing global population and livestock-farming practices. Moreover, point-source higher levels of E2 can be expected in large cities, as a consequence of the population concentration.\nSome E2 exposure effects include testis-ova induction in males (Metcalfe et al.,\n2001), reduced gonadosomatic index and courting behaviour in males (Bjerselius et al., 2001), male spawning (Mills et al., 2003) and testicular growth inhibition (Panter et al., 2004), as well as decreased egg production by females (Imai et al., 2005). Besides the previous effects, the measurement of the estrogen-inducible phospholipoglycoprotein - vitellogenin (Vtg) - as a sensitive marker of exposure to estrogens, including E2, has gained widespread endorsement by scientists, industry and regulatory agencies (EPA, 1999; Arukwe et al., 2002; Craft et al., 2004; Marin and Matozzo, 2004;). Vitellogenesis or egg yolk production represents an E2 initiated\nkey process in oviparous vertebrates and is crucial for oocyte maturation. This induction requires neuroendocrine coordinated feedback loops involving the hypothalamus, pituitary, liver and gonads (Thomas, 1990). Vtg is synthesized in the liver, transported via vascular system to the ovaries being sequestered and incorporated in developing oocytes. After sequestration by oocytes, Vtg is protealytically cleaved forming the yolk proteins lipovitellin and phosvitin. Thus, Vtg constitutes a major source of nutrition for the developing oocytes, being found in the plasma of maturing females in concentrations up to 100 mg/mL, often constituting over 50 % of the blood protein.\nSignificant levels of Vtg are normally only present in sexually maturing female. However, male, immature and nonvitellogenic females had estrogen receptors (Kishida et al., 1992), as well as a silent Vtg gene, generally present but not expressed (Moncaut et al., 2003). Thus, male and immature fish can respond to exogenous estrogens, such as E2, producing Vtg which tends to remain elevated because of lack of mechanisms to clear the protein (Funkenstein et al., 2000). A Vtg increase was observed in different fish species namely Dicentrarchus labrax L. (Mananos et al., 1990), Salmo salar L. (Arukwe et al., 1999), Sparus aurata L. (Funkenstein et al., 2000), Fundulus heteroclitus L. (Pait and Nelson, 2003) and Salvelinus alpinus L. (Berg et al., 2004) after laboratory exposure to E2.\nIn the present research work D. labrax was adopted as a bioindicator, since it represents a keystone species with economic and ecological importance in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean and Black Sea.\nThe objectives of this research were:\n-\tThe assessment of Vtg induction on immature fish following an E2 waterborne or intraperitoneal (i.p.) exposure. Moreover, it was intended to compare the relative importance of the exposure route on the estrogenic activity of E2.\n-\tThe evaluation of E2 uptake following a 10 days exposure period, measured as its levels in plasma.\n-\tThe study of the relationship between levels of E2 and Vtg in plasma, in order to a better understanding of vitellogenesis process in this fish species.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nChemicals\n170-Estradiol (E2) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany). Marine salt was obtained from Sera Premium (France). All the other chemicals were of analytical grade obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany) and E. Merck-Darmstadt (Germany).\nTest animals\nThe experiments were carried out with juvenile D. labrax specimens purchased from a local fish farm, Materaqua - ilhavo, Portugal. Fish weighing 21.80\u00b11.32 g and measuring 12.4\u00b13 cm were transported in aerated water and acclimated to laboratory conditions for one week prior to experimentation. During acclimatization and experimental periods fish were kept in 80 L aquaria, at 20\u00b0C in aerated (dissolved oxygen: 7.3\u00b10.4 mg/L) and filtered artificial seawater (34 g/L salinity), with a pH of 8.4\u00b10.3. Fish were neither fed under laboratory adaptation nor during the experimental period.\nExperimental design\nThis study includes two experiments, corresponding to two different E2 exposure routes - water diluted (WD) and i.p. injected (IP).\nIn WD experiment, fish were exposed to water diluted E2 at the concentrations of 200 ng/L (0.734 nM) or 2000 ng/L (7.34 nM). The appropriate amount of E2 was previously dissolved in 1 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and added to the experimental aquaria to reach the previous initial nominal concentrations. The same E2 amount was daily added to the experimental aquaria, without water renewal. This procedure was adopted, since it was previously observed that a 4000 ng/L E2 water concentration suffered a 99 % reduction 4 h after addition (Teles et al., 2005). DMSO (1 mL) was also daily added to the control aquarium.\nBoth experiments were performed with an exposure length of 10 days using test groups of five fish (n=5). Blood was collected from the posterior cardinal vein using a Pasteur pipette with heparin. Following blood sampling, fish were sacrificed by decapitation. Blood was used for plasma isolation using an Eppendorf centrifuge (14,000 rpm).\n170-Estradiol Measurement\nPlasma E2 determination was performed using a diagnostic ELISA direct immunoenzymatic kit (Diametra, Italy). Briefly, E2 in the sample competes with horseradish-peroxidase E2 for binding onto the limited number of anti-E2 sites on the microplates. E2 concentration in the sample is calculated based on a standard series; the color intensity is inversely proportional to the E2 concentration in the sample. The method allows the determination of E2 from 20 pg/mL to 4000 pg/mL.\nPlasma vitellogenin determination\nVtg was measured in the sea bass plasma using the components of a semi-quantitative ELISA kit from Biosense laboratories (Norway). The primary monoclonal antibody for sea bass was developed in Instituto de Acuicultura de Torre de la Sal (Spain). The Biosense protocol was adapted according to the protocol developed by Mananos et al. (1994).\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistica software (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK) was used for statistical analyses. All the data were first tested for normality and homogeneity of variance to meet statistical demands. ANOVA analysis was used to compare results between fish\nRESULTS\nWD experiment revealed a significant increase in E2 plasma levels for both exposed groups (Fig. 1A). A clear relation to the exposure concentrations was not observed, since the E2 increment in the plasma of 200 ng/L exposed group was 1115%, while the 2,000 ng/L exposed group had an increment of 1340%. The methodology adopted for Vtg measurement provided a suitable standard curve, allowing a quantitative analysis approach. Thus, fish exposed to the highest E2 concentration displayed a significant increase in plasma Vtg concentrations (28.8 mg/mL of Vtg), corresponding to a 6175 % increment when compared to the control (Fig. 1B). Moreover, levels of plasma Vtg were significantly different between\nexposed groups.\nWD Experiment\nExposure Conditions\nFig. 1 - Dicentrarchus labrax (sea bass) 17p-estradiol (E2) (A) and vitellogenin (B) plasma levels after 10 days of exposure to 200 ng/L or 2000 ng/L of E2 via water-dilution (WD experiment). Values represent the means and S.E. (n=5/treatment). Significant differences are: a vs. control; b vs. 200 ng/L (P<0.05).\nConcerning IP experiment, the E2 plasma levels displayed a slight, but not statistically significant, increase in treated groups (Fig. 2A). Plasma Vtg increased significantly only in the group injected with 5 mg/kg when compared to the control (Fig. 2B). Moreover, this increase was also significant when compared to the 0.5 mg/kg treated group. Plasma Vtg concentration in 5 mg/kg treated group was 0.98 mg/mL, representing an increment of 110%.\nIP Experiment\nExposure Conditions\nFig. 2- Dicentrarchus labrax (sea bass) 17p-estradiol (E2) (A) and vitellogenin (B) plasma levels after 10 days of treatment with 0.5 mg/Kg or 5 mg/Kg of E2 via intraperitoneal injection (IP experiment). Values represent the means and S.E. (n=5/treatment). Significant differences are: a vs. control; b vs. 0.5 mg/Kg (P<0.05).\nDISCUSSION\nFew publications comparing relative toxicities of estrogens, namely E2, administered via different routes into the fish body are available. In this perspective, two different exposure routes were chosen in the present study - waterborne and i.p. injection. The waterborne exposure represents a natural intoxication path, while, i.p. administration was chosen since it may provide a closer E2 contact with the\nThe highest E2 concentration (2,000 ng/L) employed in the WD experiment was chosen to mimic endogenous levels of circulating estrogen spawning female fish, whereas the lowest concentration (200 ng/L) was adopted according to the highest levels found in the aquatic environment, as previously reported by Bowman et al. (2000). Otherwise, in the IP experiment fish were injected either with a low (0.5 mg/kg) or a high (5 mg/kg) dose of E2, since it was demonstrated that these doses produces E2 plasma levels similar to that of early and late vitellogenesis in fish (Anderson et al., 1996; Asturiano et al., 2000).\nThe 10 days exposure period adopted took into consideration that usually a period of days is necessary to induce Vtg production in fish following the occurrence of an E2 peak in plasma (Kramer et al., 1998; Hiramatsu et al., 2002).\nCurrent results of WD experiment are discussed assuming that E2 uptake from the water was greater in fish exposed to the highest dose. This is supported by studies where E2 in the water, ranging from 4,000 to 27,000 ng/L, was rapidly taken up by fish, reaching levels above the exposure concentration, within 0.5 to 4 h (Specker and Chandlee, 2003; Teles et al., 2005). In the present study, E2 plasma levels increased for both exposure concentrations compared to the control, revealing an unclear relation to the doses and exhibiting plasma levels below the initial water exposure concentrations. Even if these results appear to disagree with the previous statements, an augmented exposure length may justify the differences. Thus, considering that the current plasma E2 measurements were carried out 24 h after the last E2 addition, the possibility that E2 peak in plasma above the exposure concentrations could have earlier occurred cannot be excluded. This idea is supported by Teles et al. (2005) previous data where 4,000 ng/l E2 was almost completely removed within 16 h from Sparus aurata plasma. Nevertheless, in the current study E2 was not completely removed from plasma since its levels in treated groups were still higher than those found in the control group. These results may be explained by a different E2 uptake from plasma by target organs and/or its catabolism,\nThe E2 plasma levels were quite similar in both WD treated groups though the exposure concentrations were 10-fold different. This can also be explained by differences on E2 plasma removal. Hence, it can be suggested that a higher E2 removal rate occurred in fish exposed to the highest E2 concentration, concomitantly with a greater uptake by target organs, namely liver. This explanation is corroborated by current plasma Vtg data, as a significant induction was observed only for the highest E2 concentration, while fish exposed to the lowest dose displayed a Vtg concentration similar to the control level. These results are also in agreement with the premise that the E2 uptake from the water was greater in the fish exposed to the highest E2 dose, since Vtg levels were significantly different between exposed groups, though E2 plasmatic levels were comparable. Therefore, only in fish exposed to 2,000 ng/L E2, sufficient E2 would be available to enter the hepatocytes, bind to estrogen-receptors (ER) and activate the transcription of the Vtg loci. This idea is supported by previous studies where it was demonstrated the ER recruitment (Schultz et al., 2001) and E2 binding affinity (Donohoe and Curtis, 1996) increase with higher doses of E2, leading to more Vtg synthesis. The analysis of the available literature concerning the vitellogenesis induction in fish exposed to waterborne E2 and the current data reveals comparable results (Kramer et al., 1998; Denslow et al., 2001; Imai et al., 2005). This agreement is particularly obvious in relation to Cyprinodon variegatus where the same water diluted E2 doses induce the same responses after 7 days exposure (Bowman et al., 2000).\nIn IP experiment, plasma levels of E2 did not differ significantly from the control, which is indicative of a complete E2 disappearance from the plasma in the period of 10 days. These results agree with the findings of Korte et al. (2000) who observed E2 plasma concentrations close to control levels in i.p. treated Pimephales promelas after 48 h of exposure. Additionally, Teles et al. (2005) previously mentioned results concerning E2 plasma half-lifes also corroborate the current data.\nDespite the similar E2 levels found in plasma of both i.p. exposed groups, the Vtg increase may suggest the occurrence of a plasma E2 peak before the sampling moment, which provided a considerable liver uptake only for the highest i.p. dose as Vtg production was induced only in this case. The previous statement is corroborated by Kramer et al. (1998) who observed in P. promelas that a peak in plasma E2 typically precedes plasma Vtg increase.\nResults of IP experiment are in agreement with previous studies using a single\ni.p. injection of 5 mg/kg of E2 in males or juveniles fish. Thus, a plasma Vtg increase was observed C. variegatus (Denslow et al., 2001), Oncorhynchus mykiss (Anderson et al., 1996), S. salar (Arukwe et al., 1999) and F. heteroclitus (Pait and Nelson,\n2003), respectively at 4, 8, 14 and 21 days post-treatment. Despite the differences on the exposure time necessary for vitellogenesis induction, this particular physiological response is similar among different fish species.\nA counter-current mechanism in fish gills provides a potentially efficient transport route for the uptake of chemicals from water to the bloodstream (Rand, 1995). In fish, the oxygenated blood travels from the gills directly to most organs. Therefore, E2 entering the bloodstream in this way is distributed by all the target organs, including liver where it can also undergo biotransformation. Chemicals ingested through diet are absorbed in intestine and travel via the hepatic portal vein directly to the liver. Similarly, chemicals diluted in corn oil and i.p. injected also get in close contact with viscera being rapidly absorbed by the liver. In the present study, vitellogenesis was induced in both experiments, indicating that this hormone was efficiently taken up by juvenile sea bass, reaching liver, the target organ, when administered either via water or i.p. injection. However, only the highest concentrations were effective in both cases.\nPresent observations corroborate Bowman and coworkers proposition (2000) suggesting that a constant fish E2 water exposure appears to stimulate more the liver estrogen receptor pathway than a single injection with a high dose. According to Korte et al. (2000), the injected E2 is quickly metabolized by the liver and cleared from P. promelas plasma (70% in 6 h), suggesting a possible explanation for the diferent\nIn mature female fish Vtg is transported to the gonads, taken up into oocytes and cleaved to form the bulk of yolk protein. Nonetheless, in male and juvenile fish such pathway for the removal of Vtg from blood does not exist and it was demonstrated that Vtg elimination time from the blood could reach up to 5 months even after the source of the estrogenic stimulus had been removed. A number of studies have been focused on the correlation between the abnormal Vtg production and adverse reproductive effects and overall health (Kramer et al., 1998; Panter et al., 1998; Mills et al., 2003). In this direction, the induction of Vtg has been associated with reduced testicular growth (Jobling et al., 1996), intersexuality (Bortone and Davis, 1994), decreased egg production (Kramer et al., 1998), kidney and liver damage (Herman et al., 1988). Accordingly, current results demonstrated that both via of E2 entrance into fish body could represent a risk for icthyc fauna living in contaminated areas, either through the direct effects of Vtg abnormal production or other overall deleterious effects.\nCONCLUSIONS\nVtg production in juvenile D. labrax was induced by the E2 highest doses either following both waterborne and intraperitoneal exposures. However, a repeated exposure to waterborne E2 is more effective than a single injection.\nE2 plasma levels measured at the end of the experiment displayed an increment only for waterborne exposure. Thus, it was demonstrated that a Vtg plasma increase was measured without a concomitant increase in E2 plasma levels.\nConsidering the deleterious effects of an abnormal Vtg production previously demonstrated, environmental exposures to E2 can represent an important risk to fish.\nREFERENCES\nAnderson, M.J.; Olsen, H.; Matsumura, F.; Hinton, D.E.

Liver cytochrome P450 content (P450), ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities were measured in order to evaluate biotransformation responses. Genotoxicity was assessed as erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA) frequency. The effects on endocrine function were evaluated as plasma cortisol and glucose. Cortisol was not affected by xeno/estrogens tested, either in single exposure or mixed with BNF. Nevertheless, the intermediary metabolism was affected since glucose concentration increased after 4 h exposure to E2, and after all BNF+NP exposure lengths. Moreover, a synergism between BNF and NP was thoroughly demonstrated, whereas a sporadic antagonistic interaction was found at 4 h BNF+E2 exposure. Liver EROD and GST activities were not significantly altered by single E2 or NP exposure. However, both compounds were able to induce EROD activity in the presence of BNF. NP single exposure was able to significantly increase liver P450 content, while its mixture with BNF displayed an antagonistic interference. Considering the xeno/estrogens single exposures, only NP induced an ENA increase; however, both mixtures (BNF+E2 and BNF+NP) displayed genotoxic effects. Fish responses to mixtures of xenobiotics are complex and the type of interaction (synergism/potentiation or antagonism) in a particular mixture can vary with the evaluated biological response.\nKeywords: P450 monooxygenases; GST; ENA; Cortisol; Glucose.\nINTRODUCTION\nA wide range of common anthropogenic chemicals, accidental or deliberately released into the aquatic environment, can affect aquatic organisms at several biological levels. Alkylphenol polyethoxylates (APEs) are typically regarded as\nendocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), being 4-nonylphenol (NP) identified as the most critical APEs metabolite, since it interacts with fish estrogen receptors inducing estrogenic responses (Arukwe et al., 1998; Cheek et al., 2001) and gametogenesis impairment (Tanaka and Grizzle, 2002). Moreover, the recent detection of significant 170-estradiol (E2) concentrations in municipal treated effluents revealed the need for the toxicity assessment of this natural estrogen itself as an aquatic contaminant (Kramer et al., 1998). Besides the increasingly studied effects of the previous EDCs on reproduction-related processes, some authors demonstrated that NP suppressed the hepatic CYP1A in Salmo salar (Arukwe et al., 1997) and Oncorhynchus mykiss (Navas and Segner, 2000). Furthermore, E2 is known to affect CYP1A expression in fish, decreasing P450 content and EROD activity (Elskus et al., 1991; Arukwe et al., 1997). The P450 related MFOs metabolizes both endogenous and exogenous compounds; thus, xenobiotics may interact with the endogenous metabolic processes. According to some authors a cross-talk mechanism between P450 activities and steroid synthetic pathways may be suggested (Larsen et al., 1992; Arukwe et al., 1997). However, the CYP1A functions and its regulation by endogenous compounds or xenoestrogens have not been fully explored.\nA large number of studies reported CYP1A induction, measured as ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity increased, after exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs), in different fish species (Wolkers et al.; 1996; Pacheco and Santos, 1997; Vijayan et al., 1997; Gravato and Santos, 2002a). Nevertheless, it was found that CYP1A induction may generate reactive intermediate compounds (Varanasi et al. 1985; Stegeman and Hahn, 1994; Cantrell et al., 1998) and the consequent genotoxic and/or carcinogenic effects (Kantoniemi et al., 1996; Tuvikene et al., 1999). Several mammal studies indicated that estrogens could be genotoxic, inducing multiple types of genetic insults in cells (Liehr, 1990; Liehr and Roy, 1990). To our knowledge, minimal research has been conducted to assess the genotoxic potential of estrogens and xenoestrogens despite the growing concern over the potential effects of environmental endocrine disruptors\nFollowing phase I metabolization, environmental chemicals detoxification is carried out through phase II biotransformation reactions, namely glutathione S-transferase (GST)-mediated conjugation. It was demonstrated that, besides xenobiotics (Sandbacka and Isomaa, 2000), GST might be modulated by endogenous steroids (Gallagher et al., .2001).\nAnalyzing the available bibliography, it is evident that fish studies on E2 and NP endocrine disruption have been focused mainly on reproductive impairments. However, the endocrine disruption by environmental pollutants is not confined to reproduction, since other crucial hormonal functions can be affected, namely those involved in the maintenance of homeostasis and physiological responses to chemical stressors. Thus, the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) alterations induced by chemical exposures should be an important topic of research on endocrine toxicology. Cortisol is the major glucocorticosteroid secreted by the teleosts interrenal tissue in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation (Hontela, 1997). A considerable number of reports have indicated plasma cortisol alterations in fish after short-term exposure to pollutants, such as heavy metals (Bleau et al., 1996; Hontela et al., 1996), PAHs (Pacheco and Santos, 2001), and pulp mill effluent contaminants (Kennedy et al., 1995; Santos and Pacheco, 1996; Teles et al., 2003a). Despite previous research work reporting E2 as responsible for the HPI axis hyperactivation in O. mykiss (Pottinger et al., 1996; McQuillan et al., 2003), the information concerning the effects of the so-called xenoestrogenic chemicals at this level is limited.\nCommon cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) inducers, such as PAHs, are known to exert endocrine disruption in fish measured as lower plasma E2 levels (Casillas et al., 1991), precocious sexual maturation (Collier et al., 1998), and reduced fertility (Cheek et al., 2001). However, the effects at other endocrine levels, such as HPI axis, are poorly investigated. Wilson et al. (1998) showed that 0-naphthoflavone (BNF) affects\nthe pituitary-interrenal axis in O. mykiss, abolishing the interrenal sensitivity to ACTH stimulation as a consequence of alterations on ACTH receptor dynamics and/or on the steroidogenic pathway.\nConsidering the occurrence of significant effects at different biological levels not included in the commonly described responses, the adoption of an integrative approach is desirable in environmental toxicology. Therefore, this point of view is particularly relevant when aquatic species are facing environmental mixtures of contaminants, containing xenobiotics that may behave differently when acting in isolated or in mixtures, raising the question about additive, synergistic or antagonistic interactions.\nThe aims of the present research work, using juvenile sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) as a biological model, were to investigate:\n-\tHow xeno/estrogenic chemicals, namely E2 and NP, affect the biotransformation, measured as total cytochrome P450 content (P450), EROD (phase I) and GST activities (phase II).\n-\tThe liver somatic index (LSI) and alanine transaminase (ALT) activity as general hepatic condition indicators.\n-\tNP and E2 genotoxicity, measured as erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA).\n-\tHow the previous chemicals can affect HPI axis measured as plasma cortisol levels and intermediary metabolism, measured as plasma glucose.\n-\tThe interactions between a PAH-like compound (BNF) and E2 or NP, as a binary mixture, on the above responses, trying to simulate a likely environmental contamination by PAHs and xeno/estrogens.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nChemicals\nP-Naphthoflavone, 4-nonylphenol, 170-estradiol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd. (Germany) and marine salt from Sera Premium (Germany). All the\nTest Animals\nThe experiment was carried out with juvenile D. labrax L. specimens purchased from a local fish farm, Materaqua - ilhavo, Portugal. Sea bass weighing 14+0.30 g, measuring 8\u00b12 cm, were transported in aerated water and acclimated to laboratory conditions for one week prior to experimentation. During acclimatization and experimental periods fish were kept in 80 L aquaria, at 20 \u00b0C in aerated (dissolved oxygen: 7.4+0.2 mg/L) and filtered artificial seawater (34 g/L), with a pH of 8.386+0.02. Fish were neither fed under laboratory adaptation nor during the experimental procedure.\nExperimental Design\nFish were divided in six lots: one as control and the others were exposed to 0.9 pM BNF, 4.05 pM NP, 131 nM E2, and to the mixtures BNF+NP or BNF+E2 (maintaining the previous concentrations), during 2, 4, 8, and 24 h. Experiments were carried out using test groups of five fish (n=5). The appropriate amount of each chemical was previously dissolved in 1 mL of DMSO and added to the experimental aquaria. The same volume of DMSO was added to the control aquarium. Previous studies have demonstrated that the 0.0125 % DMSO concentration has neither detectable biotransformation or genotoxic effects in sea bass (Gravato and Santos, 2002a, b). First, the fish abdominal cavity was opened, and blood was collected from the posterior cardinal vein using a heparinised Pasteur pipette. After collecting the blood, fish were immediately killed by decapitation and its liver sampled. Liver was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at -80\u00b0C until homogenization. Blood was used for smear preparation and for plasma isolation using an Eppendorf centrifuge (14,000 rpm). The blood smears were fixed with methanol during 10 min and stained with Giemsa (5%) during 30 min.\nBiochemical Analysis\nLiver Cytochrome P450 Content and EROD Activity\nLiver microsomal fraction was obtained according to the methods of Lange et al. (1993) and Monod and Vindimian (1991), as adapted by Pacheco and Santos (1998). Cytochrome P450 content was determined using the dithionite-reduced carbon monoxide difference spectrum between 450 and 490 nm, as previously described by Hermens et al. (1990). The liver EROD activity was measured in microsome suspension as described by Burke and Mayer (1974).\nLiver GST Activity\nGST activity was determined in the cytosolic fraction as described by Lemaire et al. (1996), using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) as substrate (Habig et al., 1974). The assay, prepared in the cuvette, was carried out in a 2 mL mixture of 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.2 mM CDNB and 0.2 mM reduced glutathione (GSH). The reaction was initiated by addition of 10 pL sample. The increase in absorbance at 340 nm was recorded at 25\u00b0C for 3 min.\nLiver ALT Activity\nALT activity was measured in the cytosolic fraction according to the method of Reitman and Frankel (1957).\nProtein Measurement\nMicrosomal and cytosolic protein concentrations were determined according to the Biuret method (Gornall et al., 1949) using bovine serum albumin (E. Merck-Darmstadt) as a standard.\nPlasma Cortisol and Glucose Measurement\nThe determination of cortisol was performed using a diagnostic ELISA direct immunoenzymatic kit (Diametra, Italy). Plasma glucose was measured using a diagnostic kit (Granutest, E. Merck-Darmstadt No. 1.12194).\nENA Assay\nGenotoxicity was tested using the ENA assay. The nuclear abnormalities were scored in 1000 mature erythrocytes sample per fish, according to the criteria of Schmid (1976), Carrasco et al. (1990) and Smith (1990), adapted by Pacheco and Santos (1996). According to these authors, nuclear lesions were scored into one of the following categories: micronuclei, lobed nuclei, dumbbell shaped or segmented nuclei and kidney shaped nuclei. The final result was expressed as the mean value (%o) of the sum for all the individual lesions observed.\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistica software (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK) was used for statistical analyses. All the data were first tested for normality and homogeneity of variance to meet statistical demands. ANOVA analysis was used to compare results between fish groups, followed by LSD test (Zar, 1996). Differences between means were considered significant when P<0.05.\nRESULTS\nLiver Biotransformation Responses\nCytochrome P450 Content (Fig. 1A)\nSea bass exposed during 2 and 8 h to NP exhibited a significant increase in P450 compared to the control group. E2 and BNF+NP significantly decreased P450 at 2 and 8 h, compared to NP exposure.\nEROD Activity (Fig. 1B)\nSea bass exposed to BNF exhibited a significant liver EROD activity increase for all the exposure lengths, reaching its maximum value (44.6-fold increase) after 8 h exposure that was maintained up to 24 h. During the whole experiment, sea bass exposed to NP or to E2 revealed significantly lower EROD activity than BNF exposed fish. A significant increase in EROD activity was observed after 8 h exposure to BNF+E2 as well as after 2 and 4 h exposure to BNF+NP compared to control. BNF+E2 also revealed significantly lower EROD activity at 2, 4 and 24 h compared to BNF exposure. On the other hand, fish exposed to BNF+E2 exhibited a significantly higher EROD activity than fish exposed to E2 during 8 h. BNF+E2 induced a significantly higher EROD activity than BNF+NP at 8 h exposure. Additionally, BNF+NP displayed a less pronounced EROD activity increase during the entire exposure length, though significantly lower after 8 and 24 h compared to BNF exposure.\nGST Activity (Fig. 1C)\nA significantly decrease in GST activity was observed at 8 h exposure to BNF+NP compared either to control or to BNF exposed fish.\nHepatic Health Indicators\nLiver ALT Activity (Fig. 2A)\nALT activity significantly decreased at 2 h exposure to E2 and BNF+E2.\nLiver Somatic Index (Fig. 2B)\nThe LSI did not present any significant alteration.\nGenotoxic Response\nENA Assay (Fig. 3)\nA significant ENA increase was observed in sea bass after 4, 8 and 24 h BNF exposure, when compared to control group. An increased ENA frequency was also\nfound at 24 h NP exposure, as well as after 4 and 8 h exposures either to BNF+NP or BNF+E2 compared to the control. E2 exposure induced at 24 h, a lower ENA frequency than NP. BNF+NP induced a significantly higher ENA frequency than NP at 4 h exposure; whereas at 24 h exposure BNF+NP induced an ENA frequency lower than NP. BNF+E2 induced a significantly higher ENA frequencies than E2 only at 4 h exposure.\nLiver Biotransformation Responses\n3\nA\n2 CL\nO)\nE\n\u25a05 E c,\n+-\u00bb c 0) +-\u00bb c o O\no IO xt CL\n24\n30\ng o_\n\u25a1)\nE\nE\no E ^Q_\n+\u25a0\u00ab\n+\u25a0\u00ab\nO\n&lt;Q O Qi LU\n20\n10\na\nI e\nd\na\na\ni\n24\nLi\nb\n0\nExposure Time (hours)\nI I Control Hi BNF I^Ie^HI BNF+E2 ^NP WbNF+NP\n2\n1\n0\na\n\n\n2\t4\n8\nB\n\nb\na\nFig. 1 - D. labrax liver P450 content (A), liver EROD activity (B), and liver GST activity (C) after 2, 4, 8 and 24 h exposure to 0.9 nM of p-naphthoflavone (BNF), 4.05 nM of 4-nonylphenol (NP), 131 nM of 17p-estradiol (E2), and to a mixture of BNF+NP (0.9 and 4.05 |j.M, respectively) and BNF+E2 (0.9 nM and 131 nM, respectively).

BNF+NP exposure significantly increased plasma glucose at all exposure times, when compared to the control group. The BNF+NP exposure displayed a continuous significant plasma glucose elevation when compared either to BNF or to NP exposed groups. BNF+NP exposed group exhibited plasma glucose concentrations higher than BNF+E2 exposed group. Thus, significant differences between plasma glucose responses to the tested mixtures were observed during the whole experiment.\nE\n~o\n(n\no Q\nro E tn ro\nD_\n1000\nEndocrine Responses\n750\n500\n250\n0\n2\n4\n8\n24\nExposure Time (hours)\nBNF+NP\n\u25a1 Control MbNF I?77!

Considering the NP potential to increase P450 content after 2 and 8 h in the present study, we observed that BNF is able to prevent that raise when mixed with NP. Despite some\ntime-related fluctuations, it is evident that after 2 and 8 h exposure to NP and E2, their responses are different. The absence of P450 response to E2 exposure, as well as its decreased tendency observed after 24 h NP exposure, agrees with Sol\u00e9 et al. (2000) results who also found an unaltered total P450 in Cyprinus carpio treated with the synthetic steroid 17a-ethynylestradiol. Considering the strong CYP1A induction potential previously demonstrated by BNF in different fish species such as Perca fluviatilis, Anguilla anguilla (Forlin and Celander, 1993; Pacheco and Santos, 2002; Teles et al., 2003b), and D. labrax (Lemaire et al., 1996; Jaksic et al., 1998; Novi et al., 1998; Gravato and Santos, 2002b), this synthetic flavonoid compound was adopted in the present study as a positive control for EROD activity induction. Thus, in the present study after any BNF exposure, EROD activity increase was as expected.\nSteroid hormones are included in the endogenous factors that can regulate CYP1A expression, however their interaction mechanisms are not well established (Navas and Segner, 2000). It was suggested that the mechanism of E2 effect on CYP1A is mediated by the 170-estradiol receptor (ER) and putative estrogenresponsive elements in the CYP1A (Stegeman, 1993) altering gene transcription (Navas and Segner, 2000). Additionally, Arukwe et al. (1997) presented strong indications of cross-talk between CYP1A and estrogen-responsive genes and/or their receptor. Hence, the inhibition of CYP1A expression and activity in fish by E2 has been demonstrated (Arukwe and Goksoyr, 1997). A significant reduction in EROD activity and CYP1A protein after NP administration was also reported in fish (Arukwe et al., 1997) and mammals (Lee et al., 1996a,b), demonstrating the possible role of CYP1A and 3A isozymes in NP metabolism. According to Lee et al. (1996a, b), NP down-regulates CYP1A activity and up-regulates CYP3A activity in rat liver. The competitive nature of inhibition by NP on hepatic microsomal EROD activity indirectly suggests that this compound is a possible substrate of the CYP1A enzyme.\nThe current liver EROD activity results concerning NP or E2 single exposures did not allow the confirmation that these compounds down-regulate CYP1A activity when compared to their controls, probably due to a short-term exposure (up to 24 h).\nHowever, analyzing BNF+NP or BNF+E2 effects upon sea bass EROD activity, the results reveal that NP and E2 reduced BNF inducing potential. Consequently, a less pronounced EROD activity increase was evident after BNF+NP exposure compared to the BNF exposed group, despite the observed general increase tendency compared to the control. Similarly, sea bass exposed to BNF+E2 shows an EROD activity general increase tendency compared to control group, though lower than BNF exposed fish reaching its maximum difference at 24 h (4 times lower). Chan and Hollebone (1995) suggested that the steroids ability to bind to the CYP1A molecule may act as competitive inhibitors of EROD activity. Alternatively, Villalobos et al. (1996) and Anderson et al. (1996) presented a different perspective describing a more complex scenario. According to these authors, the CYP1A response to mixtures of CYP1A inducers and E2 may be dependent upon the concentration of both agents. These responses are mediated through the AhR and ER, respectively, though the physiological implications for fish of inhibited and/or elevated P450 levels and activities have not been fully established. Therefore, the explanation for the NP and E2 interference on BNF liver EROD induction ability is probably related to sea bass different uptake of individual or combined chemicals from the water.\nConsidering the current EROD results, it is predictable that, under environmental conditions, a reduced ability of fish to metabolize and excrete PAHs as well as other xenobiotics will depend on the eventual reduction on CYP1A inducibility due to the presence of xeno/ estrogens.\nThe relation between total P450 content and EROD activity is difficult to establish, since the EROD increase was not accompanied by a P450 elevation. Furthermore, NP induced the highest P450 level and the corresponding lowest EROD activity level. This result may indicate that a CYP3A induction may be mainly responsible for most of the liver P450 increase, suggesting a CYP3A up-regulation and simultaneous CYP1A down-regulation as stated by Lee et al. (1996b).\nDespite sea bass liver GST activity decreased tendency at 8 h exposure to NP, one punctual significant decrease at 8 h exposure to BNF+NP was observed, compared either to control or to BNF exposure enhancing the difference between\nindividual or combined chemical exposure. This particular GST decrease caused by BNF+NP at 8 h exposure may be due either to an enzymatic inhibition or to the hepatocyte decline in GSH. However, sea bass GST decreased activity seems to be able to recover from BNF+NP at 24 h exposure, returning to control and BNF levels. Furthermore, Sandbacka and Isomaa (2000) reported an increase GST activity in the O. mykiss gill epithelial cells primary cultures at 48 h exposure to BNF. C. carpio exposure to 17a-ethynylestradiol revealed no significant GST activity alterations (Sol\u00e9 et al., 2000). On the other hand, in mammals, GST activities increased significantly in direct correlation with increased bisphenol A concentrations (Nieminen et al., 2002). However, Thibaut et al. (1999) reported that in O. mykiss the majority of NP metabolites were hydrolyzed after p-glucuronidase treatment, suggesting the formation of glucuronide compounds. Arukwe et al. (2000) confirmed those findings in a study with S. salar where NP biliary and urinary metabolic products were glucuronic acid conjugates.\nConsidering the previous findings and the absence of any significant GST increase during the current BNF, NP, E2 or its combined exposure, the probable predominant involvement of other phase II conjugation enzymes such as UDP-glucoronosyltransferase (UDPGT) in sea bass, is suggested.\nHepatic Condition Indicators\nE2 was the only tested chemical that significantly decreased ALT activity, either individually or mixed with BNF, suggesting an initial metabolic alteration in the amino acid metabolism followed by an efficient adaptation process, demonstrated by its increased activity. The absence of any LSI alteration is probably due to the short exposure length.\nGenotoxic Responses\nTaking into account the BNF genotoxic potential previously observed in sea bass by Gravato and Santos (2002c), this compound can be regarded also as a\nEstrogens administration to mammals resulted in various types of DNA damage and ultimately led to tumors (Roy and Liehr, 1999). Bolt (1979) found that E2 links to DNA and proteins, inducing DNA single strand breaks (Han and Liehr, 1994) and micronuclei (Yared et al., 2002). In contrast, other authors observed that E2 was unable to form covalent bonds with nucleotide bases (Ashburn et al., 1993). Besides the parental hormones, reactive estrogen metabolites, such as catecholestrogens, may also act at the gene and/or chromosome levels (Ashburn et al., 1993; Roy and Liehr, 1999).\nIn the present study, E2 exposure did not induce any significant ENA increase. Thus, in sea bass and under the present exposure conditions, the previous results concerning the E2 genotoxic potential to mammals could not be demonstrated. Nevertheless, the current absence of ENA may reflect a tissue specific response to E2 rather than a difference between fish and mammal metabolism, since the nuclear abnormalities were searched in blood, whereas the previously described DNA damage (Han and Liehr, 1994; Yared et al., 2002) was detected in estrogen responsive tissues. Despite the previous statements, it is recommended to perform exposures longer than 24 h, since an ENA increased tendency was detected for this exposure length, despite the absence of any statistical significance.\nThe covalent addition of estrogens to DNA has been thoroughly investigated in mammals with synthetic estrogens (Roy and Liehr, 1999). Despite the relative abundance of results concerning the diethylstilbestrol genotoxicity, there are other xenoestrogens, namely NP, which interference with DNA is poorly studied. NP was reported as genomic DNA damaging agent to crustacean larvae (Atienzar et al.,\n2002). To our knowledge, there are no previous data concerning NP genotoxicity in fish. The current experiment demonstrated that 24 h exposure to NP has a genotoxic effect on erythrocytes, expressed as an ENA increased frequency. Arukwe et al. (2000) investigated the NP metabolism and organ distribution in S. salar\ndemonstrating that the highest NP concentrations were reached in blood after 21 h exposure. Since the NP blood peak in S. salar was found after 21 h and the maximum ENA frequency was observed in sea bass after 24 h exposure to NP a cause-effect relation between both events may be suggested. NP exposed sea bass displayed a highly significant ENA frequency at 24 h compared to E2 exposed fish.\nThe tested mixtures effects, compared with the individual chemical exposures, demonstrate that after 4 and 8 h exposure, the combination of xeno/estrogens with BNF, did not significantly affect the BNF genotoxic potential; moreover, the ENA frequency increases observed can be attributable only to BNF. In contrast, the ENA induction is prevented after 24 h exposure to BNF+E2 and BNF+NP mixtures, demonstrating an antagonistic interaction. After the xenobiotic uptake in fish, its fate and effects are largely governed by CYP1A catalytic activities, playing a central role in their bioactivation producing genotoxic metabolites. The comparative analyses of the observed EROD activities and ENA frequencies were not always coincident in sea bass. Thus, at 24 h NP exposure, the highest ENA frequency coincides with the lowest EROD activity level. Changes at the DNA level may be the precursors of some effects reported at higher levels of biological organization, namely affecting the fertility (Atienzar et al., 2002). Hence, in the field of endocrine disruption, the study of estrogens and/or xenoestrogens effects on DNA justifies further investigation.\nEndocrine Responses\nThe cortisol and glucose plasmatic concentrations are commonly used, respectively, as indicators of primary and secondary acute stress responses in fish (Santos et al., 1992, 1993; Santos and Pacheco, 1996; Hontela, 1997). In the present research work, exposure to individual or combined chemicals did not induce any significant alterations in plasma cortisol levels. Considering previous fish studies where plasma cortisol was increased (Thomas et al., 1993; Miller et al., 2002; Teles et al., 2003b) or decreased (Santos and Pacheco, 1996; Pacheco and Santos, 2001; Teles et al., 2003a, b) and the present absence of effects, suggested that the adrenal susceptibility may depend on the chemical nature of the water contaminants.\nAnalyzing the current plasma glucose data, after exposure to individual chemicals, it is clear that only E2 was able to induce a significant early and punctual increase at 4 h exposure followed by recovery at 8 and 24 h. Sea bass BNF+NP exposure increased plasma glucose levels during the whole experiment, demonstrating the interaction between BNF and xeno/estrogens as none of these individual chemicals were able to induce those alterations. Furthermore, BNF+NP regularly displayed significantly higher glucose levels than BNF+E2, BNF and NP individually. BNF+E2 also induced a significant plasma glucose increase at 4 h exposure compared to control, though significantly lower than the observed E2 exposure plasma glucose. Globally, plasma glucose levels demonstrated that fish stress responses to mixtures are clearly different from responses to individual chemicals. Furthermore, a BNF+NP consistent synergistic effect is observed in sea bass as increased plasma glucose levels during the entire experiment.\nGenerally, a fish stress response includes plasma cortisol and glucose increase (Vijayan et al., 1997). However, different patterns of response have been also found in A. anguilla, i.e. glucose increase and plasma cortisol decrease (Santos and Pacheco, 1996; Teles et al. 2003a, 2004), indicating that the relation between both parameters is difficult to establish. In the present study, the glucose increase was not accompanied by any cortisol variation. These results corroborated Van Der Boon et al. (1991) suggestion that cortisol influence on fish carbohydrate metabolism is not very comprehensive, since glucose is not the most important fuel in fish energy metabolism. In fish, other mechanisms besides interrenal cortisol release may be controlling glucose availability; according to Vijayan et al. (1997), under acute stress, catecholamines could be rapidly released resulting in increased glycogenolysis.\nSummarizing, the current results, using D. labrax as a biological model, demonstrate that:\n- Plasma cortisol was not affected by xeno/estrogens tested, either in single exposure or mixed with BNF. Nevertheless, the intermediary metabolism was affected since plasma glucose concentration increased after 4 h exposure to E2, and after all BNF+NP exposure lengths. Moreover, a synergism between BNF and NP was\nthoroughly demonstrated, whereas a sporadic antagonistic interaction was found at 4 h BNF+E2 exposure.\n-\tLiver EROD and GST activities were not significantly altered by single E2 or NP exposure. However, both compounds were able to induce EROD activity in the presence of BNF. NP single exposure was able to significantly increase liver P450 content, while its mixture with BNF displayed an antagonistic interference.\n-\tConsidering the xeno/estrogens single exposures, only NP induced an ENA increase; however, both mixtures (BNF+E2 and BNF+NP) displayed genotoxic effects.\n-\tFish responses to mixtures of xenobiotics are complex and the type of interaction (synergism/potentiation or antagonism) in a particular mixture can vary with the evaluated biological response.\nACKOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors express their appreciation for the financial support provided by the Aveiro University Research Institute (CESAM) and by the \u201cFunda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia\u201d (FCT - Grants No. SFRH/BD/6607/2001 and SFRH/BPD/9367/2002).\nREFERENCES\nAnderson, M.J.; Miller, M.R.; Hinton, D.E.

(gilthead seabream) were exposed to 170-estradiol (E2) 4000 ng/L and to the same E2 concentration mixed with 50,000 ng/L 4-nonylphenol (E2+NP) during 4, 8, 12 and 16 h. E2 availability and E2 plasma level variations were assessed. Liver biotransformation capacity was measured as ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities. Plasma cortisol, lactate and glucose were also determined. Genotoxicity was assessed through erythrocytic nuclear anomalies (ENA) frequency. Liver EROD activity significantly decreased during the whole experiment for both treatments, with the exception of 16 h exposure to E2. Liver GST activity was significantly increased after 8 and 12 h of exposure either to E2 or E2+NP. An endocrine disruption expressed as plasma cortisol decrease was observed after 16 h exposure under both tested conditions, concomitantly with a plasma lactate increase. No genotoxic responses, measured as ENA frequency, were detected. Analyzing the E2 water concentration in aquaria without fish it was demonstrated an intense and fast E2 loss, considerably reducing its availability to fish. In the presence of fish, E2 water levels were drastically reduced after 4 h exposure, being this reduction more pronounced in E2 aquarium when compared to E2+NP aquarium. In addition, it was demonstrated a rapid E2 uptake from the water since the highest E2 plasma concentrations were observed after 4 h exposure, followed by a continuous decrease, which became more pronounced between 8 and 12 h of exposure. Furthermore, during the first 8 h exposure to E2 and E2+NP, seabream plasma E2 concentrations were higher than the initial water exposure concentration. Comparing the E2 plasma levels in both seabream-exposed groups, it was clear that its concentration is always higher in E2+NP-treated fish. Despite the previous results, no significant differences were found in the measured responses between E2 and E2+NP.\nKeywords: Seabream; Biotransformation; Genotoxicity; Endocrine disruption.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe aquatic environment contamination by xenoestrogens - substances that modulate or mimic the action of sex steroid hormones, mainly 170-estradiol (E2) - has received considerable scientific, government and public attention (White et al., 1994; Brighty, 1996). However, natural estrogens such as E2 and estrone can also be regarded as aquatic contaminants. The discovery of significant E2 concentrations in municipal sewage treatment plants effluents (Brighty, 1996) became a matter of concern, being the assessment of its effects on fish at different levels, strongly recommended.\nThe degradation products of nonylphenol polyethoxylates, such as 4-nonylphenol (NP), are able to activate fish estrogen-dependent gene expression (Ackermann et al., 2002), revealing estrogenic properties either in vitro (White et al., 1994) or in vivo (Jobling et al., 1996). The polymer industry is the most important source of NP environment contamination, being the major part (95%) released to water. The majority of fish studies carried out on this subject concerned the effects on reproductive aspects. Either E2 or NP elevate plasma vitellogenin and zona radiata proteins in both males and females (Ackermann et al., 2002), induce intersexuality (Jobling et al., 1996), inhibit spermatogenesis and alter gonadosomatic index (Sepulveda et al., 2003). Besides the known interference on reproduction, it is also important to study the interaction of synthetic and natural steroids with other biological responses. In this perspective, a substantial lack of information concerning the effects of this type of compounds on nonreproductive endocrine responses is evident. Considering the important role of cortisol on fish physiological responses to stressors through intermediary metabolism regulation, immune function and hydromineral homeostasis (Hontela, 1997), its alterations after exposure to xeno/estrogens must be investigated.\nDifferent authors (Pajor et al., 1990; Arukwe et al., 1997) proposed a cross-talk mechanism between P450 activities and steroid synthetic pathways. Thus, cytochrome P450-based mixed-function oxygenase (MFO) system is involved in xenobiotics and endogenous steroids metabolism. Despite the lack of information\nconcerning CYP1A regulation by endogenous compounds, it was demonstrated that both EROD activity and CYP1A respond to estrogens (Sol\u00e9 et al., 2000). A significant reduction in EROD activity and CYP1A protein was reported in several fish species, namely Pseudopleuronectes americanus, Stenotomus chrysops (Gray et al., 1991) and Salmo salar (Arukwe and Goksoyr, 1997) after E2 exposure. The same pattern of response was also observed in S. salar (Arukwe et al., 1997) after NP exposure. Metabolites resulting from biotransformation processes (phase I) may be conjugated with endogenous molecules (phase II) making them more readily excretable (Goksoyr and Forlin, 1992). Gallagher et al. (2001) found that conjugase activities are also modulated by endogenous steroids. Additionally, effects of synthetic or natural steroids include genotoxicity (Liehr, 2000) as it was proposed that they could induce genetic damage and gene mutations in mammals (Roy and Liehr, 1999; Yared et al.,\n2002). However, to our knowledge only a few studies are available concerning genotoxicity of these compounds in nonmammal species. NP was reported as genomic DNA damaging agent to crustacean larvae (Atienzar et al., 2002), and genotoxic to sea bass, measured as erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA) (Teles et al., 2004a).\nGilthead seabream, Sparus aurata L., seawater teleost widespread in Atlantic and Mediterranean coastal waters, is one of the most commercially important species, and as protandrous hermaphrodite is particularly appropriate as a biological model to endocrine studies.\nEnvironmental waters are frequently contaminated simultaneously by different natural and synthetic steroids, being therefore relevant to study xeno/estrogen mixtures effects, as well as their eventual interference on single compounds effects, in fish.\nThe aims of the present research work, using juvenile seabream, were to assess the waterborne E2 or E2 mixed with NP (E2+NP) effects on biotransformation, measured as total P450 content, ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity (phase I) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity (phase II). The variation on E2 concentrations in aquaria water and in seabream plasma was determined during the\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nChemicals\nNP and E2 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany). Marine salt was supplied by Sera Premium (Germany). All the other chemicals were of analytical grade obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany), Roche (Germany) and E. Merck-Darmstadt (Germany).\nTest Animals\nThe experiment was carried out with juvenile S. aurata specimens obtained from a local fish farm, Materaqua - ilhavo, Portugal. Seabream weighing 34+0.3 g were transported in aerated saltwater and acclimated to laboratory conditions for 1 week prior to experimentation. During acclimatization and experimental periods, fish were kept in 80-L aquaria, at 20\u00b0C in aerated (dissolved oxygen: 7.4+0.2 mg/L) and filtered artificial seawater (34 g/L salinity), with a pH of 8.4+0.2.\nExperimental Design\nFish were divided in three lots: one as control and the others were exposed either to E2 or E2 mixed with NP (E2+NP), during 4, 8, 12 and 16 h. The appropriate amount of each chemical was previously dissolved in 1 mL of DMSO and added to the experimental aquaria in order to prepare the following nominal concentrations: 14.68 nM (4000 ng/L) of E2 and 183.5 nM (50,000 ng/L) of NP. The same volume of DMSO was added to the control aquarium, since this concentration has no damaging effects on fish (Pacheco and Santos, 1998). Experiments were carried out using test groups of five seabream (n=5). E2 or E2+NP (in the previous nominal concentrations)\nwere added to two additional aquaria (E2nf and E2+NPnf), kept without fish, in order to determine the E2 availability to fish after the eventual adsorption and degradation occurring during the same exposure period.\nFish were killed at each sampling point and their blood and liver were collected. Liver was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at -80\u00b0C until homogenization. Blood smears were prepared. Blood plasma was isolated using an Eppendorf centrifuge (14,000 rpm).\nBiochemical Analysis\nLiver Cytochrome P450 Content and EROD Activity\nCytochrome P450 content was determined using the dithionite-reduced carbon monoxide difference spectrum between 450 and 490 nm, as previously described by Hermens et al. (1990).\nThe liver EROD activity was measured in microsome suspension as described by Burke and Mayer (1974) as adapted by Pacheco and Santos (1998). The reaction was carried out, at 25 \u00b0C, in the fluorometer cuvette containing 1 mL 0.5 pM ethoxyresorufin (in 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.4, containing 0.15 M KCl and 20% glycerol) and 100 pL of microsomal suspension. The reaction was initiated by adding 10 pL of NADPH (10 mM) and the progressive increase in fluorescence, resulting from the resorufin formation, was measured for 3 min (excitation wavelength 530 nm, emission wavelength 585 nm). EROD-activity was expressed as picomoles per minute per milligram of microsomal protein.\nLiver GST Activity\nGST activity was determined in the cytosolic fraction as described by Lemaire et al. (1996), using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) as substrate (Habig et al., 1974). The assay was carried out in a quartz cuvette with a 2 mL mixture of 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.2 mM CDNB and 0.2 mM GSH. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 pL sample at 25\u00b0C. The increase in absorbance was recorded at 340 nm wavelength during 3 minutes.\nProtein Measurement\nMicrosomal and cytosolic protein concentrations were determined according to the Biuret method (Gornall et al., 1949) using bovine serum albumin (E. Merck-Darmstadt) as a standard.\nCortisol, Glucose and Lactate Measurement\nThe determination of cortisol was performed in plasma using a diagnostic ELISA direct immunoenzymatic kit (Diametra, Italy). The cortisol in the sample competes with horseradish peroxidase-cortisol for binding onto the limited number of anti-cortisol sites in the microplate. Cortisol concentration in the sample is calculated based on a series of standards and the color intensity is inversely proportional to the cortisol concentration in the sample. The method allows the determination of cortisol from 10 ng/mL to 500 ng/mL.\nPlasma glucose was measured spectrophotometrically (340 nm) according to the method modified from Banauch et al. (1975) based on the quantification of NADH after a glucose oxidation catalysed by the glucose-dehydrogenase. The quantity of NADH formed is proportional to the glucose concentration.\nPlasma lactate levels were determined spectrophotometrically (340 nm) according to the method modified from Noll (1974) using lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH), ALT and NAD, measuring the NADH appearance.\n17^-Estradiol Measurement\nThe E2 determination was performed using a diagnostic ELISA direct immunoenzymatic kit (Diametra). E2 in the sample competes with horseradish-peroxidase E2 for binding onto the limited number of anti E2 sites on the microplates.\nE2 concentration in the sample is calculated based on a series of standard; the color intensity is inversely proportional to the E2 concentration in the sample. The method allows the determination of E2 from 20 pg/mL to 4000 pg/mL.\nPlasmatic and water E2 measurements were carried out during the entire experiment. The E2 quantification on water was performed in the experimental aquaria (E2, E2+NP) containing seabream, as well as in two additional aquaria kept without fish (E2nf, E2+NPnf).\nLiver Somatic Index\nLSI results were presented as a frequency (%) resulting from the following expression: [liver mass (g)/body mass (g)]x100%.\nENA Assay\nThe blood smears were fixed with methanol during 10 min and stained with Giemsa (5%) during 30 min. In order to evaluate genotoxicity the erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities were scored in 1000 mature erythrocytes sample per fish, according to the criteria of Schmid (1976), Carrasco et al. (1990) and Smith (1990), adapted by Pacheco and Santos (1996). According to these authors, nuclear lesions were scored into one of the following categories: micronuclei, lobed nuclei, dumbbell shaped or segmented nuclei and kidney shaped nuclei. The final result was expressed as the mean value (%o) of the sum for all the individual lesions observed.\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistica software (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK) was used for statistical analyses. All the data were first tested for normality and homogeneity of variance to meet statistical demands. ANOVA analysis was used to compare results between fish groups, followed by LSD test (Zar, 1996). Differences between means were considered significant when P<0.05.\nRESULTS\nWater and Plasma 170-Estradiol Quantification (Table I)\nA time-related reduction in 170-estradiol concentrations was observed either in aquaria with fish (E2 and E2+NP) or without fish (E2nf and E2+NPnf), during the entire experiment. However, this E2 reduction was more pronounced in aquaria containing fish. On the other hand, the E2+NP aquaria always presented clearly higher E2 concentrations than the E2 aquaria, either in the fish presence or absence. After 4 h exposure E2 levels in the aquaria with fish were drastically reduced, i.e., a 99% reduction in E2 aquarium and a 93.5% reduction in E2+NP aquarium. Furthermore, the control level was reached after 4 h in E2 aquarium, whereas in E2+NP aquarium this reduction occurred after 12 h of exposure. The maximum E2 plasma levels were observed after 4 h exposure in both treated groups, presenting thereafter a time-related decrease. Seabream exposed to E2+NP exhibited E2 plasma concentrations higher, at least two-fold, than E2-treated group. In the period between 4 and 8 h, it was observed, for treatments, the lowest E2 plasma reduction, 15% and 30% reduction for E2- and E2+NP-treated fish, respectively. The highest plasma E2 reduction was observed after 12 h in E2 (83% reduction) and at 16 h in E2+NP-treated fish (67% reduction) Table I.\nTaking into account the E2 levels detected in the E2nf and E2+NPnf aquaria, indicating the E2 availability, it is noticeable that its uptake from the water in E2 group was slightly lower than in E2+NP group during the first 4 h.\nTable I - 17p-Estradiol (E2) measurement in the aquaria water 5 min, 4, 8,12 and 16 h and in the S. aurata plasma 4, 8, 12 and 16 h after the adition of E2 (4000 ng/L) or E2 mixed with 4-nonylphenol (NP) - E2+NP - 4000 ng/L and 50,000 ng/L, respectively.\t\nWater Estradiol (ng/L)\tPlasma Estradiol (ng/L)\nTime\tControl\tE2\tE2+NP\tE2nf\tE2+NPnf\tControl\tE2\tE2+NP\n5 min\t33.05\t666.01\t1618.18\t3426.21\t3879.99 4 h\t29.09\t31.46\t258.86\t1605.71\t2039.32 8 h\t17.38\t24.16\t102.08\t1238.95\t1481.23 12 h\t29.75\t17.62\t32.05\t958.90\t1203.81 16 h\t32.98\t10.18\t19.99\t630.71\t686.84\t59.14\t5997.43\t14329.58 145.55\t5111.98\t10040.00 101.31\t882.13\t4051.00 51.41\t206.10\t1355.04\nThe water quantification was performed in aquaria with fish (E2 and E2+NP) or without fish (E2nf and E2+NPnf).\t\nLiver Biotransformation Responses (Fig. 1)\nP450 content did not exhibit any statistically significant alteration (Fig. 1A). However, a significant EROD activity decrease was observed in seabream after 4, 8, and 12 h exposure to E2 and E2+NP compared to the control (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, EROD activity inhibition significantly persisted at 16 h of exposure to E2+NP. Seabream exposed either to E2 or to E2+NP did not demonstrate any significant differences between them. A significant increase in GST activity was observed in seabream at 8 and 12 h exposure to E2 or E2+NP (Fig. 1C).\nHepatic Health Indicators (Fig. 2)\nLiver ALT activity did not present any significant alteration (Fig. 2A).

Considering the previous environmental data, a spiking concentration was adopted in the current study, to ensure a substantial uptake in a short period. Thus, this fact should be kept in mind in eventual extrapolations of the current findings to environmental situations.\nThe NP concentrations detected in environment ranged from near or below limits of detection up to 180 p.g/L (Nielsen et al., 2000).\nThe measurement of E2 in aquaria without fish demonstrated a time-related reduction in E2 concentration, which is less pronounced in the presence of NP. Some studies were previously carried out on E2 sorption and degradation, which can help to explain the current results. A study testing an E2 concentration range which includes the current E2 concentration revealed that microorganisms were capable of transforming E2 with half-lives of 0.2-9 days (Jurgen et al., 2002). According to the same authors, E2 was susceptible to photodegradation with half-lives in order of 10 days. Additionally, Holthaus et al. (2002) observed that 80-90% of E2 bound to bed sediments within 1 day, whereas Ying et al. (2003) stated that E2 had a modest sorption capability to sediment.\nThe E2 decrease in water was more pronounced in aquaria with than without seabream, suggesting its rapid uptake from the water, which is corroborated by the plasma E2 increase. Thus, E2 on water was drastically reduced during the first 4 h of exposure, and concomitantly the highest E2 plasmatic concentrations were detected after 4 h, followed by its continuous decrease, which became more pronounced between 8 and 12 h exposure. Moreover, plasma E2 concentrations were higher than the initial water exposure concentration (4000 ng/L), during the first 8 and 12 h in fish, respectively exposed to E2 and E2+NP. The present results agree with Specker and Chandlee (2003) who found that E2 uptake by Paralichthys dentatus reached an initial plateau within 30 min, being accumulated in the whole-body above the exposure\nconcentrations. Comparing the E2 plasma levels in seabream exposed either to E2 or E2+NP, it is clear that its concentration was always higher in the last group. This fact may reflect alterations on E2 water/plasma/tissue uptake, and excretion, as a consequence of the simultaneous NP exposure.\nDespite the different E2 plasma levels between seabream exposed to E2 and E2+NP, in general the measured responses were not different, as discussed below.\nBiotransformation Responses\nThe CYP1A induction measured either by immunodetection or through its catalytic activity is probably the best-studied biomarker (Bucheli and Font, 1995). Hence, EROD activity has been widely used as a biomarker for fish exposure to substances that bind to the aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor (Lemaire et al., 1996; Pacheco and Santos, 1998, 2001).\nIn the present research work P450 content did not demonstrate any alteration after E2 or E2+NP exposures, which is in agreement with other authors who observed an unaltered total P450 content in Cyprinus carpio treated with the synthetic steroid 17a-ethynylestradiol (Sol\u00e9 et al., 2000) and in D. labrax exposed to E2 (Teles et al., 2004a).\nIt is known that steroid hormones can regulate CYP1A expression. A decrease in the catalytic CYP1A activities was observed in sexually mature females with elevated levels of E2, as well as in E2-treated fish, namely Oncorhynchus mykiss (Andersson and Rafter, 1990), P. americanus and S. chrysops (Gray et al., 1991). Thus, the current EROD activity decrease regularly found during the whole experiment in both exposed groups is not surprising. Though, the interaction mechanism between E2 and CYP1A is not well understood and different possibilities were presented. It was suggested that the possible binding of E2 to the estrogen receptor (ER) exhibits an anti-CYP1A influence on the CYP1A gene, indicating a probable receptor and/or gene cross-talk between CYP1A and estrogen-responsive genes (Arukwe et al., 1997; Navas and Segner, 2000). However, the ability of steroids, including E2 binding to the CYP1A molecule, acting as a competitive inhibitor\nDespite NP estrogen-like properties (White et al., 1994) its interference with CYP1A function was demonstrated as an EROD activity reduction in juvenile S. salar (Arukwe et al., 1997). Furthermore, BNF potential to induce EROD was also reduced either by NP or E2 D. labrax exposure (Teles et al., 2004a). Considering the previous findings a higher EROD activity reduction should be expected in E2+NP than in E2 seabream exposed groups; however, current results did not confirm this hypothesis, since there was no NP additional effect under co-exposure.\nThe less pronounced decrease in EROD activity was observed at 16 h exposure to E2 coinciding with the lowest E2 plasma concentration and thus suggesting an E2 metabolic turnover in the hepatocytes. Furthermore, the E2 inhibitory action was kept up to the end of the experiment in E2+NP exposed fish, which coincided with a substantially higher E2 blood concentration than that observed in E2 exposed fish.\nP450 enzymes are constitutively expressed being also modulated (induced/inhibited) by chemicals. Since no potential CYP1A inducers were used in the present study, it seems that E2 affects the constitutive liver CYP1A expression, as previously demonstrated by Navas and Segner (2000) in monolayer cell cultures of O. mykiss.\nThe physiological implications of P450 MFO activities inhibition have not been fully established (Arukwe et al., 1997). Nevertheless, this MFO inhibition by environmental estrogens may reduce fish ability to metabolize and excrete xenobiotics as well as endogenous estrogens, causing alterations at different biological levels and not only on reproduction. These metabolic changes may have important ecological consequences, as fish are frequently exposed in the environment to different classes of chemicals. Furthermore, the mechanisms involved in these interaction processes should be studied.\nTo our knowledge, no previous data concerning E2 effects on fish GST activity are available. Concerning synthetic steroids, 17a-ethynylestradiol induced no\nalterations on C. carpio GST activity (Sol\u00e9 et al., 2000). On the other hand, a mammalian study demonstrated that bisphenol A increased GST activity (Nieminen et al., 2002). The GST activity increase observed in the current study is suggestive of an increased hepatic steroid catabolism in fish. CYP induction and conjugation activities may occur simultaneously, depending on the enzyme involved and its regulation. Thus, the inhibition detected on CYP1A activity was not extended to other CYP families. Taking into account that steroid metabolism and elimination may be catalyzed by CYP3A and that previous investigations on synthetic steroids effects demonstrated a CYP1A down-regulation and a CYP3A up-regulation, further laboratory studies on E2 biotransformation, namely CYP3A induction should be carried out (Lee et al., 1996a, b).\nHepatic Condition Indicators\nThe LSI increase observed in both treatments at 16 h exposure indicates metabolic alterations. The ALT kept constant, indicating that no cell damage was induced under the experimental conditions. Concerning LSI and ALT no differences were detected between E2 single exposure and the NP co-exposure.\nGenotoxic Response\nRecent works on genotoxicity of aquatic environment contaminants have demonstrated the suitability of the ENA assay, based on micronuclei and other nuclear anomalies detection in mature erythrocytes. This test, successfully adopted in different fish species (Pacheco and Santos, 1996, 1998, 2001, 2002; Ayll\u00f3n and Garcia-Vasquez, 2001; Gravato and Santos, 2002), is expanding in application due to its simplicity, rapidity, sensitivity, and low cost. However, its utilization may present some limitations in the presence of intense contamination since it can be masked by an increased splenic erythrocytic catabolism and/or erythropoiesis rate reduction (Pacheco and Santos, 2002).\nIn the present study, E2 or E2+NP exposure did not induce any significant ENA increase. However, an ENA increasing trend was observed at 4 and 8 h that returned\nto control levels after 12 h exposure to E2 or E2+NP. Comparing the ENA frequency and E2 plasmatic levels the explanation previously presented for EROD and GST activities can be adopted, i.e., the ENA highest values were found concomitantly to the highest plasma E2 concentrations. Thus, the occurrence of an ENA expression limitation in the presence of intense contamination, as previously suggested by Pacheco and Santos (2002), does not apply to this particular situation.\nE2 was classified as nonmutagenic and nongenotoxic, based on the failure to induce gene mutations in classical bacterial and mammalian mutation assays; however, this matter seems to be highly controversial (Roy and Liehr, 1999). In a recent review work on estrogens DNA damage and mutations Roy and Liehr (1999) stated that this classification was probably related to the lack of a sensitive method for detection of estrogen covalent binding to DNA bases, and because the classical mutation assays performed were designed to uncover mutations only at one specific locus and could not have detected other types of mutations or changes in other genes. According to International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC) (1999) E2 genotoxicity was not demonstrated in vivo, neither in humans, nor in mice; nevertheless, E2 was classified as a carcinogen, class I (IARC, 1999).\nIn the present study, the E2 genotoxic potential was not demonstrated. However, the importance of further fish studies on estrogen genotoxicity is increased by the lack of data in nonmammal organisms, being recommended the adoption of longer exposures in realistic conditions.\nStress Responses\nThe studied stress responses and the respective methodologies proved their suitability and reproducibility in previous studies with different fish species and different classes of contaminants (Teles et al., 2003a, b, 2004a, b), encouraging their utilization on toxicological endocrine research works.\nThe plasma cortisol decrease observed for both exposure conditions is an indication of endocrine impairment. Despite the lack of fish studies concerning cortisol alterations after E2 exposure, plasma cortisol decrease was also found in various fish\nstudies after short-term exposure to different contaminants (Pacheco and Santos, 2001; Teles et al., 2003a). The mechanism involved in this response is not completely clarified. Santos and Pacheco (1996) found that the interrenal cortisol release into the blood is prevented by the contaminant (i.e. endocrine disruptor) since an interrenal cortisol accumulation was observed in parallel with a reduced plasma cortisol concentration. The observed cortisol secretion dysfunction may reduce fish physiological competence, growth, and survivorship since this hormone is required for a wide range of important homeostatic mechanisms, including fuel reserves mobilization.\nThe E2 potential to induce a plasma glucose increase was previously demonstrated in D. labrax (Teles et al., 2004a); however, this effect was not confirmed for the current S. aurata study.\nThe plasma lactate increase, observed for E2 and E2+NP exposures can be regarded as an indication of stress. This response seems to be expectable since it was demonstrated for a wide range of xenobiotics (Santos and Pacheco, 1996; Pacheco and Santos, 2001; Teles et al., 2003a), despite the lack of any publications concerning specifically the current compounds.\nCortisol effect includes the gluconeogenic activation, mobilizing substrates such as lipids, amino acids and lactate as fuel energy, besides carbohydrates. Analyzing simultaneously the plasma cortisol and lactate responses it is evident an opposite trend of variation; thus, it can be suggested that the observed plasma lactate increase could have been potentiated by a reduction of the cortisol induced gluconeogenesis.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe current data concerning seabream exposure either to E2 or to its mixture with NP revealed:\n- a liver EROD activity depression after both treatments, while GST activity was elevated;\n-\tan endocrine disruption, expressed as plasma cortisol decrease after exposure either to E2 or E2+NP. Furthermore, a plasma lactate increase was measured for both conditions;\n-\tthat despite the higher E2 levels measured in plasma of E2+NP comparing to E2-treated fish, no significant differences were detected on the biological responses due to NP co-exposure.\nIt was also demonstrated a high E2 spontaneous loss in the aquaria, and a rapid E2 uptake by fish (in the first 4 h).\nACKOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors express their appreciation for the financial support provided by the Aveiro University Research Institute (CESAM) and by the \u201cFunda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia\u201d (FCT - Grant no.

(European eel) was exposed for 24 h to chromium (Cr - 100 pM and 1 mM) or copper (Cu - 1 and 2.5 pM), with or without a 24-h preexposure to 0-naphthoflavone (BNF - 2.7 pM), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-like compound, simulating sequential exposure to PAHs and heavy metals. Plasma cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (T3), and free thyroxine (T4) were determined in order to assess the effects on endocrine function. Plasma glucose and lactate also were measured. The frequency of erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA) was scored as a genotoxicity indicator. Plasma T4 decreased in eels when exposed to Cr only. The interference of BNF preexposure on Cr effects was observed as a significant plasma glucose increase. Single exposures to Cu elevated plasma cortisol and glucose (2.5 pM), as well as plasma lactate (1 pM), whereas a T4 decrease was found for both concentrations. BNF preexposure prevented plasma cortisol and lactate increases; however, a greater T4 decrease was observed in eels exposed to 2.5 pM Cu. Moreover, this pretreatment was crucial for genotoxicity expression because only BNF+2.5 pM Cu-exposed fish exhibited significant ENA induction. In general, plasma T4 was the most affected hormone, as it responded to all Cr and Cu exposure conditions.\nKeywords: Heavy metals; 0-Naphthoflavone; Endocrine disruption; Genotoxicity.\nINTRODUCTION\nFish inhabiting polluted waters are exposed to several compounds that might have negative consequences to their health and reproductive success. Heavy metals, in particular, are widespread contaminants released into aquatic systems from numerous anthropogenic sources, constituting a serious threat to fish. Though some heavy metals, such as chromium (Cr) and copper (Cu), are essential for physiological processes, abnormally high environmental concentrations of these chemicals may become toxic. The effects of Cr and Cu have been a matter of numerous\nApart from investigations of the response levels mentioned above, very few studies have been carried out on Cr- and Cu-induced endocrine alterations. The endocrine system is particularly important because of its crucial function in maintaining internal fish homeostasis. In this context, cortisol plays a central role through gluco- and mineral-corticoid functions, as it is an end product of the hypothalamo-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis in response to different stressors. Thus, Cu has been shown to increase fish plasma cortisol (Dethloff et al., 1999; De Boeck et al., 2003); however, no data are available about the effects of Cr at this level.\nFish growth, reproduction, and osmoregulation can be affected by xenobiotic-induced alterations of the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis (Bhattacharya et al., 1989; Zhou et al., 2000). Thyroid physiological alterations induced by heavy metals were detected following fish exposure to mercury (Bhattacharya et al., 1989) and cadmium (Ricard et al., 1998), as well as to a heavy metal-contaminated environment (Levesque et al., 2003). Nevertheless, information concerning the effects of heavy metals on the HPT axis is scarce, and to our knowledge, Cr and Cu effects have not been studied.\nBoth cortisol and thyroid hormone can interact and influence carbohydrate metabolism (Hontela et al., 1995). Exposure to Cr increased plasma glucose and lactate (Sastry and Tyagi, 1982; Nath and Kumar, 1988), whereas unclear responses were observed in Cu-exposed fish (Dethloff et al., 1999). Changes in carbohydrate metabolism, measured as plasma glucose and lactate, can be regarded as secondary fish stress responses to xenobiotics (Teles et al., 2003, 2004). Given this, understanding the interdependence of intermediary metabolism and the HPI and HPT axes becomes an important challenge to endocrine toxicology.\nHeavy metals also have been reported as genotoxic agents in fish (De Lemos et al., 2001; Sanchez-Galan et al., 2001). Cr, in particular, increased the number of\nerythrocytic micronuclei in Carassius auratus (Al-Sabti et al., 1994) and in Pimephales promelas (De Lemos et al., 2001). Furthermore, Cr has been classified as a carcinogenic compound by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC, 1990). However, there have been contradictory indications about Cu genotoxicity. Thus, Cu was suggested as a possible cause of micronuclei induction in a field study with Aldrichetta forsteri and Sillago schomburgkii (Edwards et al., 2001), whereas A. anguilla injected with Cu did not display significant induction of micronuclei (Sanchez-Galan et al., 2001).\nThe majority of fish studies conducted on heavy-metal toxicity adopted an experimental design with single-metal exposures or, in a few cases, with exposures to metal combinations. However, aquatic systems represent a vast sink of pollutants in which interactions between heavy metals and organic pollutants frequently occur. Despite the knowledge that antagonistic or synergistic mechanisms can greatly modify toxic effects, the assessment of the interactions of heavy metals with other classes of contaminants is a poorly explored area of research. For instance, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals are known to interact at different levels, namely, in MFO biotransformation activities. It was previously reported that PAH-induced ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity could be inhibited by heavy metals, including Cr and Cu (Oliveira etal., 2003).\nThe aims of the present study were to assess the effects of chromium [Cr(VI)] and copper (Cu2 ) on:\n-\tEndocrine function, measured as cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (T3), and free thyroxine (T4) plasmatic levels;\n-\tIntermediary metabolism, evaluated as plasma glucose and lactate levels; and\n-\tErythrocytic nuclear abnormality (ENA) frequency as a genotoxicity indicator.\nSequential exposures to 0-naphthoflavone (BNF, a PAH-like compound) and heavy metals (Cr or Cu) were performed in order to determine if PAH preexposure can interfere with Cr and Cu effects.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nChemicals\nP-Naphthoflavone (BNF), 0-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (0-NAD), L-lactic dehydrogenase, and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase were purchased from Sigma Chemicals Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Copper chloride (CuCl2) and potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) were from E. Merck-Darmstadt (Germany). All other chemicals were of analytical grade.\nTest Animals\nThe experiment was carried out with Anguilla anguilla L. (European eel) whose average weight was 30 \u00b1 5 g an average length was 25 \u00b1 3 cm (yellow eel); they were collected from a clean site in the Aveiro Lagoon, Murtosa, Portugal. The eels were acclimated to laboratory conditions for 1 week prior to experimentation. During recovery eels were kept at a temperature of 20\u00b0C under a natural photoperiod in aerated (dissolved oxygen: 7.6 \u00b1 0.3 mg/L), filtered, dechlorinated, and recirculating tap water with a pH of 7.2 \u00b1 0.4. The experiment was carried out in 20-L aquariums in the same conditions except without a filtering and recirculating system. Fish were not fed either during laboratory adaptation or during the experimental procedure.\nExperimental Design\nThe eels were divided into 10 groups according to the following experimental protocol (Fig. 1).\nRenewal\tSampling\n0 h\t24 h\t48 h\nI--------------------1-------------------1\n|-...

Four groups were kept in C for the first 24 h and then exposed to Cr(VI) as potassium dichromate (100 uM or 1 mM) or Cu2+ as copper dichloride (1 or 2.5 uM) during the next 24 h. Another five groups were exposed for 24 h to 2.7 uM of BNF previously dissolved in 1 mL of DMSO. One milliliter of DMSO also was added to the control and to all the other aquariums in which there was heavy-metal exposure without BNF preexposure. After that, one group was transferred to C, and the remaining four groups were exposed for 24 h to either Cr or Cu in the concentrations previous stated. Fish were killed 48 h after the beginning of the experiment, and their blood was collected. Blood smears were prepared, and the blood plasma was isolated using an Eppendorf centrifuge (14.000 rpm). Experiments were carried out in test groups of five eels (n=5).\nBiochemical Analyses\nPlasma Cortisol, TSH, Free T3, and Free T4 Measurement\nHormonal determination was performed by ELISA direct immunoenzymatic methods using commercial kits from Diametra, Italy.\nENA Assay\nTo evaluate genotoxicity, erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities were scored in 1000 mature erythrocytes per fish, according to the criteria of Schmid (1976), Carrasco et al. (1990), and Smith (1990), as adapted by Pacheco and Santos (1996). In accordance with these criteria, nuclear lesions were scored as one of these categories: micronuclei, lobed nuclei, dumbbell-shaped or segmented nuclei, and kidney-shaped nuclei. The final result was expressed as the mean value (%) of the sum of all the individual lesions observed.\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistica software (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA) was used for the statistical analyses. All data were first tested for normality and homogeneity of variance in order to meet statistical assumptions. ANOVA analysis was used to compare the results of the various fish groups, followed by the least significant differences test (Zar, 1996). Differences between means were considered significant at P<0.05.\nRESULTS\nChromium Effects\nHormonal Responses\nA. anguilla L. exposure to Cr, with or without BNF preexposure, did not reveal any significant alterations in cortisol or TSH plasma levels (Fig. 2).

No differences were observed in any of the other experimental conditions (Fig. 5). Exposure to C+1 pM Cu induced a significant decrease in TSH plasma levels compared to exposure to C+2.5 pM Cu. Plasma T3 did not show any significant alterations. However, T4 displayed a significant decrease compared to the control under all exposure conditions. The groups exposed to both Cu concentrations after BNF pretreatment revealed decreased T4 compared to BNF+C. Moreover, BNF+2.5 pM Cu caused a T4 reduction in comparison to C+2.5 pM Cu.\nExposure Conditions\nFig. 5 - Plasma concentrations of (A) cortisol, (B) TSH, (C) free T3, and (D) T4 after Cu exposure (1 or 2.5 p.M) with or without BNF preexposure.

Thus, the Cr and Cu concentrations adopted in this study previously had been shown to inhibit liver microsomal EROD activity in eels (Oliveira et al., 2004), and a liver organ culture study demonstrated a decrease in EROD activity after 24 h of exposure to Cr (Oliveira et al., 2003). To ensure a substantial phase I induction following a BNF treatment, the adopted concentration and exposure length took into consideration the results obtained by Teles et al. (2003).\nHormonal Responses\nAlterations in the HPI axis have been considered informative stress indicators and are widely used in environmental monitoring. In this context, alterations in plasma\nConcerning Cr, there has been a dearth of studies on fish interrenal physiology. In the present study, short-term Cr exposure did not induce any significant alteration in eel plasma cortisol with or without BNF preexposure. On the other hand, plasma cortisol was significantly increased by the highest Cu concentration (C+2.5 liM Cu). This finding on Cu is in agreement with those of De Boeck et al. (2003), who observed peak plasma cortisol in Cyprinus carpio after a 24h exposure to 1.9 liM Cu. Analogous results were found in Oncorhynchus mykiss (Dethloff et al., 1999) after longer exposures to Cu. Short-term exposure to cadmium (Brodeur et al., 1997) resulted in increased plasma cortisol, which was related to an osmotic disturbance. The cortisol hypersecretion found in the present study may have been preceded by HPI axis stimulation upstream of the interrenal response, as observed by Norris et al. (1997) in Salmo trutta living in cadmium- and zinc-contaminated waters. Nonetheless, plasma cortisol concentrations greatly depend on the duration and concentration of the applied stressor; thus, it is recommended longer exposures and an extended concentration range be investigated in order to clarify effects of Cr at this level.\nPrevious in vitro studies using trout interrenal tissue reported that BNF abolishes interrenal sensitivity to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation as a consequence of alterations in ACTH receptor dynamics and/or in the steroidogenic pathway (Wilson et al., 1998). Moreover, Teles et al. (2004) observed no cortisol alteration in Dicentrarchus labrax after a 24-h exposure to BNF. These findings may explain the current antagonistic action of BNF preexposure to the Cu cortisol induction.\nThe information on heavy metal effects in fish thyroid function is quite limited because most studies have investigated effects in mammals. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no studies have been conducted on the effects of Cr or Cu at this level. In the present study, eels revealed no changes in plasma TSH after Cr or Cu exposure\nwith or without BNF preexposure; however, the lowest Cu concentration (without BNF preexposure) induced a significant TSH reduction when compared with the highest Cu concentration. This result may suggest a fish adaptive capability at very high metal concentrations through alteration of its uptake and elimination, which can be expressed as an inverse relationship between metal exposure concentration and tissue burden, as suggested by Shulkin et al. (2003).\nRegarding plasma T3, a significant reduction was observed for BNF+100 liM Cr when compared to C+100 liM Cr, enhancing the determinant role of BNF pretreatment. According to Sapin and Schlienger (2003), plasma T3 is a less reliable reflection of thyroid hormone production than is T4 because most circulating T3 (around 80%) is produced extrathyroidally from T4 deiodination. Hence, BNF pretreatment seems to affect circulating T3 levels through alteration of extrathyroidal processes occurring mainly in the liver and kidney.\nPlasma T4 was revealed to be more responsive than T3 because it decreased after all exposures to Cr or Cu, which is in agreement with the finding of the majority of previous studies on heavy-metal effects. For instance, this alteration was found in Channa punctatus (Bhattacharya et al., 1989) and in O. mykiss (Ricard et al., 1998) exposed to cadmium, as well as in C. punctatus exposed to mercury (Bhattacharya et al., 1989). In the current study, the T4 decrease induced by Cu was potentiated by BNF preexposure, suggesting a synergistic interaction. Levesque et al. (2003) observed decreases in T3 and T4 in Perca flavescens in a heavy-metal-contaminated lake. Additionally, P. flavescens from a PAH- and heavy-metal-polluted site revealed decreased plasma T4 levels (Hontela et al., 1995), corroborating our results about BNF pretreatment followed by exposure to heavy metals.\nGiven the lack of TSH alterations found in this study, the general T4 decrease observed in the absence of a correspondent T3 reduction can be explained by the occurrence of some regulatory input, such as increased 5'monodeiodinase activity and/or decreased T3 clearance.\nIt is also known that thyroid hormones interact with cortisol. T4 plasma levels often follow a pattern similar to that of plasma cortisol, and T4 may activate the\ninterrenal function (Hontela et al., 1995). On the other hand, cortisol can promote conversion of T4 to T3 and increase the clearance of T3 and T4. Correlating cortisol and thyroid hormones was difficult to accomplish from the current data because plasma cortisol displayed significant changes only for one exposure condition. However, the cortisol increase observed for C+2.5 pM Cu concomitantly with a plasma T4 decrease agrees with the findings of Redding et al. (1986) on the same fish species.\nIntermediary Metabolism Responses\nThe increase in plasma glucose is an energy-mobilizing adaptive event to stressors. In the current study it was found that in the absence of BNF preexposure, only the highest Cu concentration induced hyperglycemia. This response agrees with that in a previous study carried out with O. mykiss exposed to Cu (Dethloff et al., 1999). However, the plasma glucose increase previously detected in C. punctatus (Sastry and Tyagi, 1982) and Colisa fasciatus (Nath and Kumar, 1988) exposed to Cr was not corroborated by the present data. Moreover, the current results revealed an interaction between BNF and heavy metals, but that interference seems to depend on the metal and its concentration. Thus, BNF pretreatment seems to promote hyperglycemia for the lowest Cr and Cu concentrations, evidently being a synergistic effect for BNF+100 pM Cr. However, for the highest Cr and Cu concentrations, the BNF interference seemed to diminish.\nThe direct involvement of high plasma cortisol on the observed hyperglycemic responses seemed to be evident only for the highest Cu concentration. The plasma glucose increase could be related to other hormones such as T4 and glucagon rather than catecholamines because of the duration of exposure chosen.\nAn increase in plasma lactate is one of the earliest responses associated with \u201curgent\u201d fuel consumption in tissues, that is, by anaerobic metabolism in white muscle (Trenzado et al., 2003). In the present study, only the lowest Cu concentration induced a plasma lactate increase, which was prevented by the BNF preexposure, revealing an antagonistic interaction. The results obtained in the present work\nconcerning heavy-metal exposures without BNF pretreatment do not corroborate previous findings of a lactate increase in C. punctatus (Sastry and Tyagi, 1982) and\nC.\tfasciatus (Nath and Kumar, 1988) exposed to Cr, although no alterations were detected in Cu-exposed O. mykiss (Dethloff et al., 1999). The divergence in plasma glucose and lactate findings between our results and previous studies is probably related to differences in the chosen species and protocols.\nGenotoxic Responses\nAccording to the literature, heavy-metal genotoxicity in fish depends on the heavy metal considered. Cr(VI) is readily taken up by cells, being reduced intracellularly to Cr(III), a stable form that binds DNA efficiently (De Flora, 2000), and is recognized as genotoxic by the IARC (1990). Thus, Cr(VI) exposure induced the development of micronuclei in the fish species C. auratus (Al-Sabti et al., 1994) and P. promelas (De Lemos et al., 2001). However, the current results do not corroborate the previous findings because none of the Cr concentrations used induced a significant increase in ENA frequency, probably because of the short duration of the exposure compared to the 7-day exposure carried out by Al-Sabti et al. (1994) and De Lemos et al. (2001). Sanchez-Galan et al. (2001) observed that A. anguilla injected with Cu did not display significant micronuclei induction, which agrees with the present data.\nThe absence of BNF genotoxicity effects observed after the eels were exposed for 24 h is in agreement with a previous study performed with the same species (Teles et al., 2003). Nevertheless, an increase in ENA frequency was observed for BNF+2.5 liM Cu compared to BNF+C, suggesting a positive interaction between BNF and the highest Cu concentration. Edwards et al. (2001) observed micronuclei induction in A. forsteri and S. schomburgkii inhabiting heavy-metal-contaminated waters, suggesting that Cu was responsible for that effect. From the current results, it can be suggested that the genotoxic effects found in Cu-contaminated environmental waters can be attributed to a combined effect of Cu and other contaminants (e.g., PAHs), rather than merely to Cu.\nACKOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors express their appreciation for the financial support provided by the Aveiro University Research Institute and by the \u201cFunda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia\u201d (FCT - Grant no.

Plasma cortisol, glucose, and lactate levels were evaluated as stress responses. In experiment 1, plasma cortisol, glucose, and lactate increased after 8 h of exposure in site 3, which is located farthest from the deactivated sewage outlet. However, A. anguilla seemed to adapt after 48 h of exposure in site 3, because all three parameters returned to control levels. Plasma glucose also significantly increased after 8 h of exposure at sites 1, 2, and 3, returning to control levels after 48 h. Plasma lactate levels increased after 8 h of exposure at site 3 and after 48 h of exposure at site 1. In experiment 2, A. anguilla exposed to contaminated harbor waters increased their plasma lactate after 8 and 48 h of exposure, whereas their cortisol and glucose plasma were elevated only after 48 h of exposure. The results demonstrate that even 2 years after the official closing of the BKPME sewage outlet, the river Vouga water remains contaminated by the sediment associated chemicals. Because the fishing harbor induced in A. anguilla the same type of stress responses, it is also an area of concern. The adopted stress parameters allied to a caging strategy are recommended for future environmental monitoring assessments.\nKeywords: Eels; BKPME; Harbor waters; Cortisol; Glucose; Lactate.\nINTRODUCTION\nA wide range of synthetic chemicals used for several industrial and household activities have been shown to cause endocrine disturbances in living organisms. The consequences of such perturbation can be important because of the crucial role played by the endocrine system in the coordination of physiological processes and homeostasis maintenance (Hontela, 1998). The role of cortisol as an intermediary in\nmetabolism is vital, since it is the major glucocorticosteroid secreted by the teleosts' interrenal tissue in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation (Pottinger et al., 2000). Cortisol mobilizes fuels such as amino acids, converting them into glucose and lipids, thus exerting direct and indirect effects on intermediary metabolism. Cortisol plasma levels are the most commonly used stress indicator in fish because of the rapid elevation that occurs in response to various stressors such as handling, confinement, poor water quality, and a wide variety of toxicants (Wendelaar-Bonga, 1997). An elevation in plasma cortisol levels has been observed in fish after shortterm exposure to pesticides (Bennet and Wolke, 1987), heavy metals (Bleau et al., 1996), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and crude oil (Thomas et al., 1993), as well as pulp mill effluent (Kennedy et al., 1995) and resin acids (RAs) (Teles et al., 2003a). Nevertheless, short-term exposure of Anguilla anguilla L. to bleached kraft pulp mill effluent (BKPME) (Santos and Pacheco, 1996), diesel water soluble fraction (Pacheco and Santos, 2001), naphthalene (Teles et al., 2003b), retene and dehydroabietic acid (DHAA) (Teles et al., 2003a) led to a decrease in plasma cortisol levels.\nChanges in carbohydrate metabolism measured as plasma glucose and lactate can also be used as general stress indicators in fish, and their relation to cortisol function has been investigated (Jardine et al., 1996; Santos and Pacheco, 1996; Pacheco and Santos, 2001; Teles et al., 2003a). Generally, stress responses include increases in plasma glucose and lactate (Hontela et al., 1996; Santos and Pacheco, 1996). However, divergent results have been obtained (Teles et al., 2003a), indicating the complexity of establishing a model response. Therefore, fish stress responses concerning the interdependence between interrenal function and carbohydrate metabolism due to various exposure conditions have become a subject of interest to study.\nThe Aveiro Lagoon, situated on the Portuguese coast at the mouth of the River Vouga, is an area polluted mainly by industrial and harbor activities as well as urban and agricultural wastes. The offward fishing harbor is contaminated, as usually occurs in these areas, by heavy metals (Abreu et al., 2000), organometallics such as\ntributyltin (TBT) (Barroso et al., 2000), and PAHs (Pacheco and Santos, 2001). The pulp mill industry, on the Vouga River left bank, was responsible during the past five decades for continuous hazardous discharges. The toxicological risk to fish caused by these discharges has been assessed by several studies in A. anguilla (Santos et al., 1993; Santos and Pacheco, 1995; Pacheco et al., 1993; Pacheco and Santos, 1999) and Gambusia holbrooki (Pacheco et al., 2002), with general stress, genotoxic effects, and biotransformation activation being observed.\nIn May 2000, the paper and pulp mill effluent was diverted to the Atlantic Ocean through a submarine pipe outlet. However, considering that some of the BKPME components are recognized as highly persistent in the environment, the risk for aquatic organisms may remain even after the discharge suspension. For instance, the half-life of RAs, one of the major toxicant groups in pulp mill effluents, was estimated to be ~30 years in the sediment (Stuthridge and Tavendale, 1996). The Cacia BKPME uses one-third Pinus spp. and two-thirds Eucaliptus spp. and according to Hall (1980) and Subtil et al. (1984) it enriches the effluent waters and sediments in RAs, namely DHAA, which has been identified as a mutagenic agent. Other compounds, including retene (a chemical derived from RAs) and the chlorophenolics formed from the residual lignin in bleaching of chemical pulp using chlorine, are also fairly persistent in receiving waters (Leeuwen et al., 1996).\nFor the present research work we adopted an in situ experimental design, using responses such as cortisol, glucose, and lactate plasma levels in caged A. anguilla to pulp mill sediment-contaminated water and offward fishing harbor water.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nTest Animals\nEuropean eels (A. anguilla) with an average weight of 50 g were captured at the Aveiro Lagoon, Murtosa, Portugal. The eels were acclimatized to laboratory conditions for 1 week prior to the experiment. During the recovery period, eels were kept in 80-L aquaria at 20\u00b0C under a natural photoperiod, in recirculating, aerated,\nExperimental Design\nThe eels were transported from the laboratory to the exposure sites in recipients without water (30 min), placed into 80-dm3 net cages, and plunged into the water near to the sediment for 8 and 48 h. The control groups were maintained in the laboratory, at 15+1\u00b0C and 7.82+0.6 mg/L dissolved oxygen in experiment 1, and at 20\u00b11\u00b0C and 6.15+0.6 mg/L dissolved oxygen in experiment 2, in similar net cages and subjected to the equivalent previous anoxia period (30 min).\nAt each sampling point the blood was collected from a vein using a heparinized Pasteur pipette. In the laboratory, the blood was centrifuged for plasma isolation using an Eppendorf centrifuge (14,000 rpm).\nExperiment 1: BKPME-Contaminated River\nThe eels were exposed in the Vouga River (northwestern Portugal) at three different downstream sites, located 50 (site 1), 100 (site 2), and 2000 m (site 3) (Fig.\n1)\tfrom the deactivated BKPME sewage outlet. The experiment was carried out in June (15+1\u00b0C water temperature; 8.03+0.6 mg/L dissolved oxygen).\nExperiment 2: Experiment: Estuarine Harbor Area\nThe eels were caged in an offward fishing harbor in the Aveiro Lagoon (northwestern Portugal) (site 1) (Fig. 2) in September (20+1 \u00b0C water temperature; 6.27+0.6 mg/L dissolved oxygen).\nFig. 1 - Representation of the caging locations on the Vouga River, Cacia, Aveiro, Portugal. Three exposure sites, at the following distances from the effluent source: site 1, 50 m (Outeiro), site 2, 100 m, site 3, 2000 m (Vilarinho).\nFig. 2 - Representation of the caging locations on the Aveiro lagoon, Aveiro, Portugal: site 1, offward fishing harbor.\nBiochemical Analysis\nCortisol, Glucose, and Lactate Measurements\nPlasma cortisol was determined using a diagnostic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) direct immunoenzymatic kit (Diametra, Italy, code 10011). Plasma glucose was measured using a diagnostic kit (Granutest, E. Merck-Darmstad No. 1.12194). Plasma lactate was determined with a diagnostic kit (Boehringer Mannheim GmgH, No. 149993) according to the method modified by Noll (1974).\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistic software (STATISTICA, StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK) was used for statistical analyses. All the data were first tested for normality and homogeneity of variance to meet statistical demands. Variance analysis was used to compare results between fish groups, followed by LSD test (Zar, 1996). Differences between means were considered significant when P<0.05.\nRESULTS\nExperiment 1: BKPME-Contaminated River\nA significant plasma cortisol increase was detected at site 3 after 8 h of exposure (Fig. 3A). The plasma glucose concentration significantly increased at sites 1, 2, and 3 after 8 h of exposure (Fig. 3B). Despite the absence of any statistical significance, a tendency for plasma glucose to increase was observed after 48 h of exposure at site 1. Plasma lactate was elevated after 8 h in site 3 and after 48 h in site 1 (Fig. 3C).\nExperiment 2: Estuarine Harbor Area\nPlasma cortisol, glucose, and lactate showed significant increases after 48 h exposure in the offward fishing harbor (Fig. 4). Additionally, plasma lactate level also increased after 8 h of exposure.\n8\t48\nExposure Time (hours)\n|\t\u00a1Control\nSite 1\nSite 2\nSite 3\nFig. 3 - Experiment 1.

Differences from control: *P<0.05.\nDISCUSSION\nExperiment 1: BKPME-Contaminated River\nThe results of experiment 1 support the idea that acute exposures to xenobiotics typically increase the plasma cortisol levels as part of a generalized stress response, which includes effects on the carbohydrate metabolism, namely increases in plasma glucose and lactate. The same responses were obtained in previous fish studies with pulp and paper mill effluent components such as abietic acid (Teles et al., 2003a), chlorinated RAs (Kennedy et al., 1995), and tetrachloroguaicol (Johansen et al., 1994). However, previous studies with A. anguilla revealed a divergent response in terms of plasma cortisol. Plasma cortisol was found to decrease after short-term exposures to BKPME (Santos and Pacheco, 1996) or its components such as DHAA and retene (Teles et al., 2003a). Despite the conflicting results in cortisol response, the plasma glucose and lactate alterations observed in the DHAA and retene exposures (Teles et al., 2003a) were similar to those obtained in the present research work.\nThe results just outlined regarding fish exposures to BKPMEs and their components reinforce the difficulty in establishing a consistent correlation pattern between the stress responses that are primary (i.e., plasma cortisol alterations) and those that are secondary (i.e., changes in plasma glucose and lactate).\nThe return to the control levels of plasma cortisol, glucose, and lactate observed after 48 h of exposure at site 3 can be interpreted as a fish adaptation to the chemical stressors. Nevertheless, longer exposures should be carried out to confirm this hypothesis.\nThe occurrence of a significant cortisol increase at site 3 and the concomitant absence of any alteration at the sites closer to the deactivated effluent source may be explained by the types and degree of contamination in each location. Thus, the results at sites 1 and 2 cannot be regarded as a lack of contamination but as a balance between potential inhibitors and inducers of the cortisol release, avoiding any significant response. In the same way, at site 3 this balance was probably disturbed through inducers, thus producing the observed cortisol augmentation.\nA considerable proportion of the constituents of BKPME are lipophilic, causing them to adsorb to suspended solids during biological wastewater treatment (Liu et al., 1996) and in receiving ecosystems (Holmbom et al., 1992), and leading to their persistence in the aquatic environment. Therefore, the stress responses observed in the current experiment might be attributable to a wide range of persistent compounds (e.g. chlorophenolics, RAs, and their derivatives) and the eventual interactions between them. Although it is difficult to pinpoint which compound or class of compounds is responsible for the observed effects, the results of a previous study (Teles et al., 2003a) suggest that abietic acid should be considered as one of them.\nExperiment 2: Estuarine Harbor Area\nIn this experiment, the parameters studied responded similarly to those in experiment 1 - that is, increased plasma cortisol, glucose, and lactate levels.\nTaking into consideration the type of contaminants expected in the studied harbor area, the present cortisol results are in conformity with prior short-term exposures to sublethal doses of heavy metals (Bleau et al., 1996; Hontela et al., 1996), PAHs, and crude oils (Thomas et al., 1987). Furthermore, Pacheco and Santos (2001) observed increased plasma cortisol (exposures from 3 h up to 3 days) and glucose levels (6 days exposure) in eels exposed to diesel water-soluble fraction. Nevertheless, short-term exposure of eels to naphthalene, a PAH previously detected in the study area (Pacheco et al., 2002), revealed a decrease in plasma cortisol levels (Teles et al., 2003b).\nThe temporal changes in the assayed biomarkers were clearly different in both experiments. Particularly notable in this harbor area experiment was the absence of the previously described fish acclimatization process, suggesting that the recovery mechanisms depend on the type of contaminants rather than on the fish species.\nGeneral Statements\nThe studied parameters, namely plasma cortisol levels, can be affected by a variety of variables, both biotic (sex, predation, confinement, and handling) and abiotic (photoperiod, temperature, water dissolved oxygen) (Hontela, 1997). Accordingly, the conditions of the laboratory controls adopted in the current study were carefully defined to avoid significant differences in the field groups in terms of handling and other stress factors, as well as in terms of abiotic parameters.\nVariables such as fish migration, spatial variability of sediment and water contaminant loading, exposure length impreciseness, and lack of knowledge concerning fish history before moving into an area of concern often confound the interpretation of field data. Thus, caging studies offer several advantages in aquatic toxicology, being a promising approach to evaluate environmental contamination (Soimasuo et al., 1995). Additionally, this kind of in situ exposure allows the selection of a desired species, its particular developmental stage, and genetic background (Lindstrom-Seppa and Oikari, 1990).\nThe observed plasma cortisol elevation in exposed fish (experiments 1 and 2) can be regarded as a characteristic reaction to chemical stressors. Thus, as previously suggested by several authors (Santos and Pacheco, 1996; Hontela, 1997), this primary stress response can be a useful stress biomarker in fish.\nDespite the unanimous interpretation of cortisol elevation as a natural response, one cannot disregard the interference with other biological functions causing deleterious effects to fish. Studies of the immunomodulatory potential of cortisol found that it reduces the antibody-producing cells and circulating lymphocytes (Pickering and Stewart, 1984), as well as interacting with the production of lymphokines (Tripp et al., 1987) in teleosts. The incidence of infection by bacteria, fungi, and protozoans has been found to increase in fish with high plasma cortisol levels (Pickering, 1989). Furthermore, the elevation of plasma cortisol can enhance the toxicity of environmental contaminants such as heavy metals and polychlorinated biphenyls (Miller et al., 2002), and decrease the growth hormone levels (Pickering et al., 1991).\nGlobally, the results presented here reveal the difficulty in interpreting the responses of aquatic organisms to complex mixtures of pollutants, as well as the need to better understand the general fish stress process, namely the interaction between interrenal function and carbohydrate metabolism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe current results indicate that both the BKPME-contaminated river (Vouga River) and the offward fishing harbor waters may constitute an ecotoxicological hazard to fish populations, since they induced stress responses, namely increased plasma cortisol, glucose, and lactate levels. Furthermore, it can be suggested that the chemical stressors produced by the former pulp mill activity were not completely removed after a 2-year cleanup process.\nStress responses in A. anguilla, such as changes in plasma cortisol, glucose, and lactate, combined with a caging experimental strategy, during specific adequate exposure periods, should be recommended for environmental monitoring.\nACKOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors express their appreciation for the financial support provided by the Aveiro University Research Institute (CESAM) and by the \u201cFunda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia\u201d (FCT grant no.

This freshwater ecosystem receives effluents from different origins namely, industrial, in particular electroplating industrial effluents containing heavy metals, domestic wastes, as well as pesticides and fertilizers resulting from agriculture activities. The aim of the present research work was to monitor the effects induced by the contaminants present in Pateira de Fermentelos water, using Anguilla anguilla L. (European eel) as a bioindicator. The following biomarkers were measured: liver ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and alanine transaminase (ALT) activities, plasma levels of cortisol, 170-estradiol (E2), thyroid-stimulating-hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (T4), free triiodothyronine (T3), as well as glucose and lactate. Moreover, the frequency of erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA) was scored. The eels were caged for 48 h at a reference site near the C\u00e9rtima river spring and at 4 sites of Pateira de Fermentelos differing in their distances to the main known pollution source (C\u00e9rtima River): A (closest to the lagoon entrance), B, C and D (farthest to the C\u00e9rtima River). The results of this short-term in situ experiment revealed plasma E2 increase at sites B and D when compared to all the other sites, including reference site. Plasma T3 showed a decrease only at site A when compared to reference site. Plasma cortisol and glucose concentrations were increased at all tested sites, revealing a similar pattern of response. The present results revealed indications of Pateira de Fermentelos water contamination, demonstrating the usefulness of this adopted strategy.\nKeywords: Anguilla anguilla, Pateira de Fermentelos, Biotransformation, Endocrine Function, Genotoxicity.\nINTRODUCTION\nLakes, ponds and dams are predisposed to receive and accumulate contaminants discharging from domestic and industrial sewages, as well as agriculture runoff due to their specific water dynamics and configurations differing from other aquatic ecosystems. Pateira de Fermentelos (PF) is a natural freshwater wetland ecosystem located at the central region of Portugal with an area of about 5 Km2. This water-body is considered an expansion of the C\u00e9rtima River, its main tributary stream, communicating with \u00c1gueda River. Over the last decades, eutrophication produced by domestic sewage and agricultural fields'nutrient runoff, which was aggravated by the incorrect introduction of new organisms, markedly increased the threat to ichthyc populations. Moreover, input of pesticides and industrial effluents, namely from electroplating industries located along C\u00e9rtima River, contributed to generate a cocktail of contaminants. However, little attention was paid to this ecosystem and a single study is available on its health assessment, which reported the levels of heavy metals, including nickel, zinc, aluminum and manganese (Almeida, 1998). In this context, there is a need for an effective biomonitoring program.\nAquatic toxicology has been using several analytical techniques in order to measure a wide range of chemicals (Rotchell and Ostrander, 2003). However, in the presence of complex environmental mixtures, it becomes impracticable to quantify all the contaminants making difficult a complete scenario characterization. In this context, a strategy involving biomarkers was demonstrated to be a suitable alternative for monitoring and management of aquatic ecosystems (Flammarion et al., 2002).\nBiomarkers enable the evaluation of eventual additive, synergistic or antagonistic interactions in the environment, since chemicals may behave differently when acting individually or in mixtures. Furthermore, biomarkers reduce expensive chemical analysis and the information provided may be used as an \u201cearly warning system\u201d (Flammarion et al., 2002; Rotchell and Ostrander, 2003; Marin and Mattozzo,\n2004).\nBiochemical and physiological biomarkers, in particular, were used in order to prevent irreversible damage in whole organisms, communities and ecosystems (Lopez-Barea and Pueyo, 1998). The induction of liver ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, a dependent cytochrome P450 1A monooxygenase, is one of the best-studied responses in fish (Bucheli and Fent, 1995). Hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) and hypothalamo-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axes also play a central role in a wide range of important homeostatic mechanisms in fish. Thyroid hormones regulate growth and hydromineral balance (Van Anholt et al., 2003), while cortisol is involved in the energy metabolism regulation, anti-inflammatory response, as well as immune competence (Hontela, 1997; Wendelaar Bonga, 1997). Thyroid hormones and cortisol both interact and influence carbohydrate metabolism (Hontela et al., 1995). Alterations in plasma concentrations of these hormones, as well as in glucose and lactate levels reflect endocrine alterations, thus affecting fish physiological competence to cope with environmental changes. Hence, the previously mentioned parameters may also be useful tools in monitoring the impact of anthropogenic stressors on fish.\nThe interaction of genotoxic compounds with DNA induces structural changes in DNA. Unrepaired changes produce cell lesions leading to tumor formation (Malins et al., 1990). Recent studies on genotoxicity of aquatic contaminants demonstrated the suitability of fish erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA) assay, based on micronuclei and other nuclear anomalies detection in mature erythrocytes. This ENA test was successfully adopted in different fish species (Ayllon and Garcia-Vasquez, 2001; Pacheco and Santos, 2002; Teles et al., 2005a) and is expanding in application due to its simplicity, rapidity, sensitivity and low cost.\nBearing in mind the suitability of Anguilla anguilla L. (European eel) as a bioindicator, in the present study, a battery of 10 biomarkers was evaluated on in situ exposed eels, caged at increasing distances from the main known PF pollution source (Certima River). Hepatic responses were evaluated by measuring liver EROD and alanine transaminase (ALT) activities. The endocrine function was assessed by measuring plasma levels of cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free\ntriiodothyronine (T3), free thyroxine (T4) and 170-estradiol (E2). The intermediary metabolism was evaluated as plasma glucose and lactate levels. Finally, ENA frequency was determined as a genotoxicity biomarker. It was intended to estimate the relationship between the studied A. anguilla biological responses and the different PF exposure sites as an indication of the overall ecosystem condition. Furthermore, the suitability and sensitivity of the adopted biomarkers battery in the early detection of the freshwater contamination was evaluated.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nChemicals\nAll chemicals were of analytical grade, obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and E. Merck-Darmstadt.\nTest Animals\nThe experiment was carried out using A. anguilla with an average weight of 49.50 \u00b1 0.6 g, collected from a non-polluted site in the Aveiro lagoon - Murtosa, Portugal. The eels were acclimated to laboratory conditions for 7 days prior to experimentation under standard conditions. Briefly, fish were kept at room temperature and natural photoperiod, in aerated (dissolved oxygen: 8.7\u00b10.5 mg/L), filtered, dechlorinated and recirculating tap water, with 7.4\u00b10.2 pH and 0 % salinity. Fish were fed neither under laboratory adaptation nor during the experimental procedure.\nIn Situ Experimental Design\nEels were transported from the laboratory to the exposure sites in containers without water, placed into 80-L net cages and plunged into the water for 48 h at 4 PF sites (A, B, C and D), differing in their distances to the main known pollution source (Certima River) (Fig. 1). One more site was chosen as a reference at the Certima River spring, without having any known industrial and domestic sewage. Fish cages\nEach exposure trial was carried out using test groups of 6 eels each. Blood was collected from the posterior cardinal vein with heparin and blood smears were prepared. Following blood sampling, fish were sacrificed by decapitation, liver excised sampled and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. In laboratory, blood was centrifuged using an Eppendorf centrifuge (5 min at 14,000 rpm) for plasma isolation\nWater Physico-Chemical Parameters\nBottom water temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) were measured in the field using an oxymeter. Water samples were collected and stored in clean, sterile, screw-capped glass containers (1 L) at 4\u00b0C for the following analysis: pH, conductivity, biological oxygen demand (BOD), total solid (TS), total dissolved solid (TDS) and total suspended solids (TSS) using procedures described in APHA (1998).\nBiochemical Analysis\nLiver EROD Activity\nEROD activity was measured in microsome suspension as described by Burke and Mayer (1974) and adapted by Pacheco and Santos (1998). The reaction was carried out, at 25\u00b0C, in the fluorometer cuvette containing 1 mL 0.5 pM ethoxyresorufin (in 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.4, containing 0.15 M KCl and 20% glycerol) and 25 pL of microsomal suspension. The reaction was initiated by adding 10 pL of NADPH (10 mM) and the progressive increase in fluorescence, resulting from the resorufin formation, was measured for 3 min (excitation wavelength 530 nm, emission wavelength 585 nm). EROD-activity was expressed as picomoles per min per mg of microsomal protein.\nLiver ALT Activity\nALT activity was measured, in the supernatant resulting from microsomal isolation, according to a colorimetric method based on the measurement of the pyruvate produced by the transamination reaction (Reitman and Frankel, 1957).\nProtein Measurement\nMicrosomal and cytosolic protein concentrations were determined according to the Biuret method (Gornal et al., 1949) using bovine serum albumin as a standard.\nPlasma Cortisol, TSH, Free T3, Free T4 and 17^-Estradiol Measurement\nThe determination of cortisol, TSH, T3 and T4 were performed in plasma, using diagnostic ELISA direct immunoenzymatic kits (Diametra, Italy). The absorbance in each well was measured at 450 nm in a microplate reader (ASYS Hitech).\nThe cortisol in the sample competes with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-cortisol for binding onto the limited number of anti-cortisol sites in the microplate wells. The enzyme substrate (H2O2) and the TMB-substrate (TMB) are added, and after an appropriate time has elapsed for maximum color development, the enzyme reaction is stopped and the absorbances are determined. Cortisol concentration in the sample is calculated based on a series of standards and the color intensity is inversely proportional to the cortisol concentration in the sample.\nThe methods for free T3 and free T4 follow the same principles of the cortisol test, requiring immobilized T3 or T4 antibodies, as well as HRP-T3 or HRP-T4 conjugates.\nConcerning TSH, an antibody specific to the 0-chain of TSH molecule is immobilized on microwell plates and other antibodies to the TSH molecule are conjugated with HRP. TSH from the sample is bound to the plates. The enzymatic reaction is proportional to the amount of TSH in the sample.\nThe E2 determination was performed using a diagnostic ELISA direct immunoenzymatic kit (Diametra, Italy). E2 in the sample competes with horseradish-peroxidase E2 for binding onto the limited number of anti E2 sites on the microplates. E2 concentration in the sample is calculated based on a series of standard; the color intensity is inversely proportional to the E2 concentration in the sample.\nPlasma Glucose and Lactate Measurement\nPlasma glucose was measured spectrophotometrically (340 nm) according to the method modified from Banauch et al. (1975) based on the quantification of NADH after a glucose oxidation catalyzed by glucose-dehydrogenase. The quantity of NADH formed is proportional to the glucose concentration.\nPlasma lactate levels were determined spectrophotometrically (340 nm) according to the method modified from Noll (1974) using lactate-dehydrogenase, ALT and NAD, measuring NADH appearance.\nENA Assay\nThe blood smears were fixed with methanol for 10 min and stained with Giemsa (5%) for 30 min. In order to evaluate genotoxicity, the erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities were scored in 1000 mature erythrocytes sample per fish, according to the criteria of Schmid (1976), Carrasco et al. (1990) and Smith (1990), adapted by Pacheco and Santos (1996). According to these authors, nuclear lesions were scored into one of the following categories: micronuclei, lobed nuclei, dumbbell shaped or segmented nuclei and kidney shaped nuclei. The final result was expressed as the mean value (%o) of the sum for all the individual lesions observed.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistica software (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK) was used for statistical analyses. All the data were first tested for normality and homogeneity of variance to meet statistical demands. ANOVA analysis was used to compare results between fish groups, followed by LSD test (Zar, 1996). Differences between means were considered significant when P<0.05.\nRESULTS\nWater Physico-Chemical Parameters\nWater temperature showed no important variations neither in reference site nor PF sites (Table I). The pH was alkaline at all sites, with an incremental pH trend from site A (minimum) to site C (maximum), followed by a decrease at site D. Conductivity measurement showed no major differences among all the study sites. Concerning DO levels, the observed variation ranged from 6.62 (site D) to 10.34. BOD also showed a variation along all the sites being highest at site D. Among the ammonium, nitrates, nitrites, phosphate, carbonates hardness and total hardness parameters, only nitrites showed marked presence at sites B and D. In terms of TS and TSS, major differences were found since a higher level was detected at reference site.

Thus, caging studies offer several advantages in aquatic toxicology, being a\nIn the present study, A. anguilla, a representative species of PF ichthyofauna, was chosen as a bioindicator due to a considerable knowledge of its physiology and based upon previous research carried out in our laboratory (Santos and Pacheco, 1996; Santos et al., 2004). Moreover, A. anguilla resistance and sensitivity to adverse conditions made it particularly applicable to sublethal studies.\nThe physicochemical analysis has long been employed to assess the water quality. In the current study, water quality parameters are, in general, at acceptable levels considering criteria given in APHA (1998) and in Merck guide lines (Aquamerck, Germany), as well as the A. anguilla requirements in particular. However, some exceptions must be considered, as observed for pH, BOD and nitrite levels. Water pH showed a considerably high level at site C (9.64), which may be assumed as an indication of strongly to extremely polluted condition. All the other sites presented pH levels in a range belonging either to unpolluted or slightly polluted state. As a pollution marker, BOD levels revealed site D as the most oxygen demanding, suggesting the existence of a moderate pollution state. Nitrite levels showed a moderately polluted state at sites B and D. In terms of depth, differences were found along PF study sites; however, these differences were inversely related to DO levels, constituting a possible explanation for DO variations. Considering the previous water quality characterization, the studied fish responses are mainly discussed according to the different distances to the main pollution source. Nevertheless, some site-specific responses are also discussed keeping in view the respective water quality variables.\nPF exposed eels showed unchanged EROD activity at all exposure sites, suggesting the presence of unsufficient amounts of CYP1A1-modulators in order to alter its biotransformation activity. However, taking into account the contaminant cocktail likely to occur in PF, this result should be carefully interpreted since it cannot be excluded the occurrence of a balance between potential CYP1A1 inhibitors (e.g.\nA. anguilla increased plasma cortisol concentrations at all the PF exposure sites indicating the presence of stressors, though a gradient related to the increased distance from the main pollution source (Certima River) was not found. Cortisol elevation is known as a natural response to stress, signaling that the animals were physiologically competent and homeostatic regulatory mechanisms are intact. Nevertheless, one cannot disregard the interference with other biological functions that may produce deleterious effects to fish (Brown et al., 1991; Maule et al., 1996). Furthermore, plasma cortisol increase can enhance the toxicity of environmental contaminants such as heavy metals (Miller et al., 2002). A plasma cortisol increase was previously observed in fish exposed short-term to heavy metals (De Boeck et al.,\n2003)\tor pesticides (Waring and Moore, 2004), which support current findings due to the type of contaminants expected in the studied area. It can be also suggested that the cortisol hypersecretion measured in the present study may have been preceded by HPI axis stimulation upstream of the interrenal response, as observed by Norris et al. (1997) in Salmo trutta living in cadmium- and zinc-contaminated waters. Cortisol is also closely related with other metabolic pathways, such as gluconeogenesis resulting in increased plasma glucose release. This correlation is evident in the current research study as after 48 h exposure both plasma cortisol and glucose significantly increased. Accordingly, previous studies revealed an increase in both parameters following exposure of Oncorhynchus mykiss to heavy metals (Hontela et al., 1996) or Cyprinus carpio to pesticides (Gluth and Hanke, 1985). Furthermore, previous studies focused on intermediary metabolism revealed a plasma glucose increase in Colisa fasciatus exposed to heavy metals (Martinez et al., 2004) and A. anguilla exposed to pesticides (Sancho et al., 1998).\nThe elevation of cortisol and glucose levels is frequently accompanied by changes in metabolites such as lactate. However, this pattern of response was not found in the present study since plasma lactate was unaltered. Grutter and Pankhurst (2000) observed similar results in caged Hemigymnus melapterus, suggesting that elevated plasma lactate is not a requisite component of the fish stress response. These authors assumed that the stress induced either by chemicals or capture and handling does not always induce anaerobiosis in fish, mainly due to behavior features. Additionally, according to the same authors lactate accumulation may occur but without significant release of lactate ions into the plasma.\nThyroid hormones regulate growth, development and metabolism and are involved in more biological actions than any other hormone (Liu and Chan, 2002). Hence, HPT alterations provide important information about the health status of fish, being reliable candidates as biomarkers of environmental contamination (Hontela, 1997; Teles et al., 2005b). Present data revealed unaltered plasma TSH and T4 levels, concurrently with a general plasma T3 decreasing tendency at all exposure sites, being significant at site A, probably due to its proximity to the main known pollution source. These results agree with previous studies where a plasma T3 decrease was detected after exposure either to heavy metals (Carletta et al., 2002) or pesticides (Thangavel et al., 2005). Since it was previously observed that heavy metals inhibit the conversion of T4 into T3 by 5'monodeiodinase, the T3 plasma decreased level may indicate a lower fish capability of converting T4 into T3. On the other hand, Thangavel et al. (2005) justifies the decrease in plasma T3 after pesticide exposure with a reduction on fish metabolic rate, indirectly reducing the toxic impact of the pesticide. Additionally, the indirect action of contaminants through the interference of cortisol may also be considered as an explanation for plasma T3 decrease. It was previously demonstrated that fish treated with cortisol had lower plasma T3 concentrations while T4 was less affected, which was explained by a faster T3 clearance from the blood or a slower conversion of T4 into T3 (Redding et al., 1984). Further research work by the same authors (Redding et al., 1986) and Brown et al. (1991) showed that cortisol treatment enhances plasma T3 clearance\nwithout deiodinating activity alteration. Hence, the current results corroborate the impact of the cortisol increase on plasma T3 decrease, probably due to a faster T3 clearance from plasma. Though, it does not allow us to exclude other explanations, namely those related to the contaminants direct action upon the HPT axis. The measurement of TSH in plasma in addition to plasma T4 and T3 provides an overall perspective of the HPT axis status. Despite the decrease in plasma T3 the HPT axis was not significantly affected, since TSH and T4 plasma levels were unaltered.\nE2 measurement in fish plasma can be a useful indicator of estrogens presence in the aquatic environment, considered as endocrine disruptor compounds (EDC) (Imai et al., 2005). Thus, the plasma E2 increase observed in A. anguilla at sites B and D may reflect the presence of E2 in PF water rather than any EDC capability of increasing endogenous E2 eel's plasma levels. To our knowledge, there is no evidence that immature eels increase plasma E2 in a period of 48 h. The alterations on E2 levels reported for sites B and D are concomitant with the measurement of high levels of nitrites at the same locations. The occurrence of such nitrite levels is indicative of a partial decomposition of organic material resulting from anthropogenic discharges, mainly domestic and livestock wastes corroborating the hypothesis of sewage E2 input. However, this correlation cannot be completely assumed since it is also known that nitrites occur as a result from an intensive use of nitrogenous fertilizers.\nGenotoxicity in the present work, measured as ENA frequency, was unaltered at all exposure sites. However, according to Maria et al. (2005) a blood DNA integrity loss, measured as increased DNA strand breaks, was observed in the same species at sites A and C after 48 h exposure, demonstrating the presence of genotoxic chemicals at those particular sites. This apparent disagreement is probably justified by the ability of the DNA strand breaks assay to detect earlier genotoxic events, depending on DNA damage and repair capacity that may precede the ENA appearance. Therefore, in order to evaluate PF genotoxicity using ENA assay, longer exposures are recommended.\nThe present results revealed indications that PF water was contaminated, as evidenced by an increase in plasma cortisol and glucose levels at all sites. However, study sites differ in terms of contamination, i.e. chemical variety and concentrations, since plasma T3 was significantly decreased only at site A and plasma E2 increased at sites B and D. In conclusion, the previous biomarkers, using A. anguilla allied to a caging exposure strategy, are recommended for future environmental monitoring assessments.\nACKOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors express their appreciation for the financial support provided by the Aveiro University Research Institute (CESAM) and by the \u201cFunda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia\u201d (FCT - Grant n\u00b0 SFRH/BD/6607/2001).\nREFERENCES\nAlmeida, S.

Neste contexto, foram estudados efeitos da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a: (i) \u00e1cidos res\u00ednicos (AR) - \u00e1cidos abi\u00e9tico e desidroabi\u00e9tico, e um seu derivado - reteno; (ii) a um hidrocarboneto arom\u00e1tico polic\u00edclico (HAP) - naftaleno e a um composto do tipo HAP - p-naftoflavona (BNF); (iii) bem como a uma hormona \u201cnatural\u201d - 170-estradiol (E2).\nA relev\u00e2ncia dos AR resulta do facto de serem componentes representativos da contamina\u00e7\u00e3o associada a efluentes da produ\u00e7\u00e3o de pasta de papel (EPP). O naftaleno \u00e9 o representante mais simples da classe dos HAP, cujos efeitos em peixes est\u00e3o ainda pouco estudados. A BNF \u00e9 um composto flavon\u00f3ide sint\u00e9tico que embora n\u00e3o possuindo uma estrutura qu\u00edmica pura de HAP foi utilizado pelo facto de ser um agonista do receptor aril-hidrocarbono (Ah) e apresentar um comportamento indutor de mono-oxigenases P450 tipo HAP (Novi et al., 1998; Gravato e Santos, 2002a). A BNF foi deste modo usada como composto padr\u00e3o para o estudo da fase I da biotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o, bem como de outras respostas associadas. A import\u00e2ncia do estudo dos efeitos do E2 em peixes prende-se com o facto de, nos \u00faltimos anos, se ter acumulado informa\u00e7\u00e3o cient\u00edfica sobre a exist\u00eancia de concentra\u00e7\u00f5es anormalmente elevadas desta hormona no ambiente aqu\u00e1tico (Ying, 2005).\nO trabalho relativo \u00e0 exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a E2 contemplou duas formas diferentes de administra\u00e7\u00e3o - atrav\u00e9s da dilui\u00e7\u00e3o na \u00e1gua e por via intraperitoneal (i.p.) - tendo em considera\u00e7\u00e3o que os peixes absorvem os xenobi\u00f3ticos, fundamentalmente, a partir da da \u00e1gua (via guelras e pele) e da sua dieta (via intestino).\nOs intervalos de concentra\u00e7\u00f5es dos contaminantes xenobi\u00f3ticos adoptados nas exposi\u00e7\u00f5es laboratoriais podem ser considerados, de uma forma geral,\nNos cap\u00edtulos II a VI foi avaliada a varia\u00e7\u00e3o das concentra\u00e7\u00f5es plasm\u00e1ticas de cortisol em Anguilla anguilla L. (enguia Europeia) e Dicentrarchus labrax L. (robalo) expostos a diferentes contaminantes. A exposi\u00e7\u00e3o ao \u00e1cido abi\u00e9tico foi a \u00fanica que induziu um aumento de cortisol plasm\u00e1tico (cap\u00edtulo II), de acordo com a resposta referida como t\u00edpica, face a exposi\u00e7\u00f5es de curto prazo a diferentes xenobi\u00f3ticos (Bleau et al., 1996; Pacheco e Santos, 2001a; De Boeck et al., 2003; Waring e Moore,\n2004). Contudo, todos os outros compostos testados (\u00e1cido desidroabi\u00e9tico, reteno, naftaleno e E2), excluindo a BNF, induziram um decr\u00e9scimo dos n\u00edveis plasm\u00e1ticos de cortisol, o que est\u00e1 em aparente desacordo com a resposta frequentemente assumida como t\u00edpica. Em geral, considerava-se que apenas exposi\u00e7\u00f5es cr\u00f3nicas a contaminantes podiam causar uma incapacidade do peixe elevar os seus n\u00edveis de cortisol plasm\u00e1tico como resposta ao stresse da captura e manuseamento (Hontela et al., 1992, 1995). No entanto, esta ideia foi posteriormente posta em causa pelos trabalhos de Santos e Pacheco (1996) e Pacheco e Santos (2001b) em exposi\u00e7\u00f5es de curto prazo de A. anguilla a EPP ou \u00e0 frac\u00e7\u00e3o sol\u00favel em \u00e1gua do gas\u00f3leo. Desta forma, os presentes resultados est\u00e3o em concord\u00e2ncia com os anteriormente referidos, uma vez que, maioritariamente, as exposi\u00e7\u00f5es mostraram induzir uma desregula\u00e7\u00e3o end\u00f3crina, expressa atrav\u00e9s da incapacidade dos peixes elevarem o cortisol no plasma face a situa\u00e7\u00f5es de stresse. De acordo com os resultados obtidos, deve passar a considerar-se o decr\u00e9scimo de cortisol plasm\u00e1tico como um padr\u00e3o alternativo de resposta dos peixes a exposi\u00e7\u00f5es de curto prazo a contaminantes, o mesmo tendo sido corroborado pelos trabalhos de Benguira et al. (2002).\nNo caso das exposi\u00e7\u00f5es prolongadas, a incapacidade de eleva\u00e7\u00e3o do cortisol tem sido explicada pela exaust\u00e3o do eixo hipot\u00e1lamo-pituit\u00e1ria-tecido interrenal (HPI) e consequente atrofia da pituit\u00e1ria, possivelmente devido \u00e0 sua hiperactividade (Hontela et al., 1995). Considerando exposi\u00e7\u00f5es de curto prazo, Santos e Pacheco (1996) sugerem que determinados contaminantes xenobi\u00f3ticos poder\u00e3o inibir a liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de cortisol na corrente sangu\u00ednea por parte do tecido interrenal, baseados\nna observa\u00e7\u00e3o de elevados n\u00edveis de cortisol nesse tecido concomitantemente com baixos n\u00edveis no plasma. Assim, este segundo mecanismo prop\u00f5e como uma boa hip\u00f3tese explicativa relativamente aos resultados obtidos no presente trabalho. A globalidade das respostas inclu\u00eddas nos cap\u00edtulos II a VI, evidencia um padr\u00e3o de resposta que depende do composto em causa, n\u00e3o parecendo estar relacionado, de forma t\u00e3o marcada, com a esp\u00e9cie.\nAs altera\u00e7\u00f5es dos n\u00edveis plasm\u00e1ticos de glucose e lactato foram tamb\u00e9m determinadas como respostas secund\u00e1rias de stresse, para todos os compostos anteriormente referidos, excepto para o naftaleno. Os peixes expostos a AR demonstraram um padr\u00e3o de resposta entendida como t\u00edpica e que corresponde ao aumento destes dois par\u00e2metros (Santos et al., 1990; Vijayan e Moon, 1992). Contudo, o reteno e a BNF induziram aumentos unicamente na concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de glucose, enquanto que o E2 foi o \u00fanico contaminante que n\u00e3o induziu qualquer altera\u00e7\u00e3o nestes par\u00e2metros.\nTendo em considera\u00e7\u00e3o o importante papel do cortisol no metabolismo intermedi\u00e1rio, torna-se importante o entendimento da sua rela\u00e7\u00e3o com os n\u00edveis plasm\u00e1ticos de glucose e lactato. Geralmente \u00e9 referido que a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a agentes de stresse induz aumentos destes tr\u00eas par\u00e2metros (Hontela, 1997; Janz, 2000). Este padr\u00e3o de resposta apenas foi observado ap\u00f3s exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a \u00e1cido abi\u00e9tico. Contudo, foram verificadas subidas dos n\u00edveis de glucose e de lactato em exposi\u00e7\u00f5es para as quais n\u00e3o se observou qualquer altera\u00e7\u00e3o na concentra\u00e7\u00e3o plasm\u00e1tica de cortisol, tendo sido por vezes observado descidas dessas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es. Desta forma, a an\u00e1lise global da interdepend\u00eancia entre a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de cortisol e os par\u00e2metros secund\u00e1rios de stresse revelou ser complexa, n\u00e3o sendo pass\u00edvel de previs\u00e3o com base num modelo \u00fanico e pr\u00e9-estabelecido.\nTendo em considera\u00e7\u00e3o que compostos tipicamente indutores das enzimas associadas ao CYP1A mostraram afectar a fun\u00e7\u00e3o da tir\u00f3ide em mam\u00edferos, decidiuse estudar o efeito da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de A. anguilla a BNF sobre o eixo hipot\u00e1lamo-pituit\u00e1ria-tir\u00f3ide (HPT) (cap\u00edtulo IV). Assim, foi observado um decr\u00e9scimo da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de tiroxina (T4) no plasma, mantendo-se contudo inalterados os n\u00edveis\nda hormona estimuladora da tir\u00f3ide (TSH) e da triiodotironina (T3). Os resultados parecem dar apoio \u00e0 hip\u00f3tese de que o decr\u00e9scimo de T4 plasm\u00e1tico se deve \u00e0 sua remo\u00e7\u00e3o do plasma, em consequ\u00eancia do aumento da glucoronida\u00e7\u00e3o e excre\u00e7\u00e3o biliar da T4, devido \u00e0 indu\u00e7\u00e3o da UDP-glucoronosil transferase hep\u00e1tica pela BNF (Gravato e Santos, 2002b). A manuten\u00e7\u00e3o dos n\u00edveis de T3 reflecte uma maior capacidade de estabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos seus n\u00edveis no plasma comparativamente com a T4. Tendo em considera\u00e7\u00e3o o decr\u00e9scimo de T4, seria de esperar uma resposta compensat\u00f3ria da pituit\u00e1ria no sentido do aumento da TSH. No entanto, essa resposta n\u00e3o se verificou vindo demonstrar a dificuldade ainda existente no entendimento da rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre estes par\u00e2metros no que respeita \u00e0s respostas a xenobi\u00f3ticos.\nNo cap\u00edtulo VI avaliou-se a capacidade de indu\u00e7\u00e3o da s\u00edntese de vitelogenina (Vtg) em D. labrax juvenis ap\u00f3s 10 dias de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a E2. Os n\u00edveis plasm\u00e1ticos de E2 foram tamb\u00e9m avaliados ap\u00f3s exposi\u00e7\u00e3o, assim como a sua rela\u00e7\u00e3o com a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de Vtg plasm\u00e1tica. A forma como os anteriores par\u00e2metros podem ser afectados pela via de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o - dilui\u00e7\u00e3o na \u00e1gua versus injec\u00e7\u00e3o intraperitoneal (i.p.) foi tamb\u00e9m avaliada. O aumento das concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de E2 no plasma foi apenas observado na exposi\u00e7\u00e3o via \u00e1gua, contudo na exposi\u00e7\u00e3o i.p o seu completo desaparecimento do plasma ocorreu ap\u00f3s o per\u00edodo de 10 dias. Esta diferen\u00e7a n\u00e3o pode ser atribu\u00edda de forma definitiva \u00e0 diferen\u00e7a entre as vias de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o uma vez que na exposi\u00e7\u00e3o via i.p. foi administrada uma \u00fanica dose no primeiro dia, enquanto que na exposi\u00e7\u00e3o via \u00e1gua o E2 foi adicionado diariamente \u00e0 \u00e1gua. As duas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es mais elevadas de E2 demonstraram ser capazes de induzir a s\u00edntese de Vtg atrav\u00e9s das duas vias de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o, indicando que o E2 foi de facto absorvido pelos peixes tendo atingido o f\u00edgado.\nA actividade biotransformadora hep\u00e1tica foi tamb\u00e9m avaliada (cap\u00edtulos III e V) em exposi\u00e7\u00f5es laboratoriais a contaminantes isolados. O naftaleno e a BNF foram capazes de induzir um aumento da actividade da 7-etoxiresorufina O-desetilase (EROD), comparativamente com a BNF o naftaleno induziu um aumento de EROD mais tardio. Apesar da capacidade indutora da actividade de EROD demonstrada por\nestes compostos, eles revelaram tamb\u00e9m a capacidade de reduzir esta actividade enzim\u00e1tica, especialmente para as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es mais elevadas e durante as primeiras horas de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o. Este efeito est\u00e1 possivelmente relacionado com a ocorr\u00eancia, numa fase inicial, de elevadas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es no tecido hep\u00e1tico, onde essa ac\u00e7\u00e3o foi detectada. A determina\u00e7\u00e3o da alanina transaminase (ALT) no f\u00edgado n\u00e3o demonstrou a ocorr\u00eancia de les\u00f5es hep\u00e1ticas que possam justificar a redu\u00e7\u00e3o da actividade de EROD pelo que a hip\u00f3tese de ocorr\u00eancia de uma ac\u00e7\u00e3o inibit\u00f3ria sobre a enzima sai refor\u00e7ada. O desaparecimento da ac\u00e7\u00e3o inibit\u00f3ria e subsequente express\u00e3o de uma ac\u00e7\u00e3o indutora pode ser explicada por uma adapta\u00e7\u00e3o progressiva dos peixes e/ou decl\u00ednio dos n\u00edveis de compostos na \u00e1gua com repercuss\u00e3o nos n\u00edveis teciduais. Assim, os resultados apontam para uma depend\u00eancia da actividade de EROD em fun\u00e7\u00e3o do tempo de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o e das concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de xenobi\u00f3tico.\nA actividade de EROD n\u00e3o foi alterada em D. labrax por exposi\u00e7\u00e3o ao E2. Contudo, de acordo com estudos anteriores seria de esperar a ocorr\u00eancia de uma inibi\u00e7\u00e3o desta actividade, dada a capacidade dos ester\u00f3ides se ligarem \u00e0 mol\u00e9cula do CYP1A actuando como inibidores (Navas and Segner, 2000; Elskus, 2004). O naftaleno revelou ser um indutor da actividade da conjugase GST (fase II) no f\u00edgado.\nNo que respeita \u00e0 genotoxicidade, a resposta da A. anguilla, foi claramente diferente em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos dois compostos testados no cap\u00edtulo III. Assim, o naftaleno demonstrou possuir propriedades genot\u00f3xicas induzindo um aumento na frequ\u00eancia de anomalias nucleares eritroc\u00edticas (ANE), enquanto que a BNF n\u00e3o produziu qualquer altera\u00e7\u00e3o deste par\u00e2metro no mesmo per\u00edodo de tempo (72 horas). Geralmente, considera-se que as caracter\u00edsticas mutag\u00e9nicas dos HAP est\u00e3o relacionadas com o n\u00famero de an\u00e9is benz\u00e9nicos e a sua bioactiva\u00e7\u00e3o, especialmente por ac\u00e7\u00e3o da fase I da biotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o. No entanto, a indu\u00e7\u00e3o precoce de ANE e o decr\u00e9scimo simult\u00e2neo da actividade de EROD observados, sugerem que o pr\u00f3prio naftaleno poder\u00e1 ser genot\u00f3xico, sem necessitar de bioactiva\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00e9via. Uma vez que o naftaleno \u00e9 liposol\u00favel e possui apenas dois an\u00e9is arom\u00e1ticos, a sua entrada na c\u00e9lula \u00e9 facilitada pelo que um grande n\u00famero de mol\u00e9culas poder\u00e1 rapidamente ser transportada para o n\u00facleo e interagir com o \u00e1cido desoxirribonucleico (ADN).\nA express\u00e3o da resposta genot\u00f3xica em termos de frequ\u00eancia de ANE pode ser condicionada pela din\u00e2mica hematol\u00f3gica, ou seja, pelo balan\u00e7o entre a eritropoiese e o catabolismo dos eritr\u00f3citos. Nessa perspectiva, a frequ\u00eancia de eritr\u00f3citos imaturos (EI) foi quantificada para as exposi\u00e7\u00f5es a naftaleno e a BNF com o objectivo de detectar altera\u00e7\u00f5es nessa din\u00e2mica. Assim, os resultados de EI demonstraram que o naftaleno n\u00e3o interferiu com a din\u00e2mica hematol\u00f3gica, ao contr\u00e1rio da BNF que causou um decr\u00e9scimo na frequ\u00eancia de EI. Este \u00faltimo resultado sugere que a aus\u00eancia de genotoxicidade observada por exposi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 BNF deve ser encarada com cepticismo, n\u00e3o se podendo excluir a possibilidade de um resultado falsamente negativo.\nA exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de D. labrax a E2 resultou no aumento da frequ\u00eancia de ANE, demonstrando o seu potencial genot\u00f3xico, n\u00e3o tendo este resultado diferido entre as duas vias de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o testadas. Tal como no caso do naftaleno, n\u00e3o foi encontrada uma correla\u00e7\u00e3o entre este efeito e a actividade de EROD.\n2.\tEXPOSI\u00c7\u00d5ES LABORATORIAIS A MISTURAS DE CONTAMINANTES\nOs trabalhos em an\u00e1lise neste ponto incluem os cap\u00edtulos VII a IX correspondendo a ensaios laboratoriais quer com misturas simples, quer com exposi\u00e7\u00f5es sequenciais a diferentes contam inantes, envolvendo tr\u00eas esp\u00e9cies de tele\u00f3steos (D. labrax, Sparus aurata L. - dourada e A. anguilla). Neste contexto, foram estudados os efeitos da intera\u00e7\u00e3o entre: (i) um composto tipo-HAP (BNF) e uma hormona \u201cnatural\u201d (E2) ou entre BNF e um derivado dos etoxilados de alquilfen\u00f3is (nonilfenol - NP) em D. labrax; (ii) E2 e NP em S. aurata; (iii) BNF e dois metais pesados - cr\u00f3mio (Cr) e cobre (Cu) em A. anguilla. A relev\u00e2ncia do NP resulta do facto de ser o metabolito mais persistente, resultante da degrada\u00e7\u00e3o dos alquifen\u00f3is etoxilados, enquanto que a import\u00e2ncia dos metais pesados resulta essencialmente da sua persist\u00eancia e resist\u00eancia \u00e0 biotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o e biodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o. A escolha do E2 e da BNF foi referida e justificada no ponto anterior.\nEm qualquer um destes cap\u00edtulos (VII a IX) foi determinada a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o plasm\u00e1tica de cortisol e glucose. Relativamente ao cortisol, observou-se maioritariamente uma aus\u00eancia de resposta, havendo a registar apenas o seu decr\u00e9scimo significativo para a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de S. aurata a E2+NP (cap\u00edtulo VII), indicando uma altera\u00e7\u00e3o end\u00f3crina. Contudo, este efeito n\u00e3o pode ser claramente atribu\u00eddo \u00e0 mistura, uma vez que um decr\u00e9scimo semelhante de cortisol foi tamb\u00e9m observado ap\u00f3s exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a E2. A pr\u00e9-exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a BNF exerceu uma ac\u00e7\u00e3o antagonista sobre a capacidade do Cu aumentar a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o plasm\u00e1tica de cortisol em A. anguilla (cap\u00edtulo IX). Este acontecimento poder\u00e1 ser devido a uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da sensibilidade do tecido interrenal \u00e0 estimula\u00e7\u00e3o pela hormona adrenocorticotrofica (ACTH), tal como foi observado anteriormente por Wilson et al. (1998) em estudos in vitro. Considerando outros estudos com peixes em que se observaram aumentos ou decr\u00e9scimos de cortisol no plasma ap\u00f3s exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a contaminantes (Santos e Pacheco, 1996; Hontela, 1997), a quase aus\u00eancia de efeito das misturas testadas neste par\u00e2metro sugere que a susceptibilidade do tecido interrenal depender\u00e1 da natureza e concentra\u00e7\u00e3o dos contaminantes, assim como da esp\u00e9cie usada.\nA glucose plasm\u00e1tica aumentou em quase todas as condi\u00e7\u00f5es de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o, tendo-se verificado uma ac\u00e7\u00e3o sinerg\u00edstica para a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de D. labrax a BNF+NP e de A. anguilla a BNF+100 liM Cr. Por outro lado, apesar do aumento significativo de glucose observado para a mistura BNF+E2, a BNF mostrou limitar a capacidade de elevar a glucose plasm\u00e1tica demonstrada pelo E2 individualmente. Os aumentos de glucose plasm\u00e1tica, verificados para a mistura BNF+Cu e para BNF+1 mM Cr, n\u00e3o podem contudo ser atribu\u00eddos a nenhuma interac\u00e7\u00e3o entre os compostos. A exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de S. aurata \u00e0 mistura de E2+NP n\u00e3o induziu qualquer altera\u00e7\u00e3o neste par\u00e2metro. De um modo geral, os n\u00edveis de glucose no plasma confirmaram ser influenciados de forma diferente em resposta a misturas quando comparada com a resposta a compostos individuais. A interac\u00e7\u00e3o entre os compostos tamb\u00e9m parece depender da sua concentra\u00e7\u00e3o.\nEm rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao outro par\u00e2metro indicador de altera\u00e7\u00f5es no metabolismo intermedi\u00e1rio (lactato plasm\u00e1tico), determinado nos cap\u00edtulos VIII e IX, observou-se que, de um modo geral, permaneceu inalterado, tendo-se observado um aumento apenas no caso da mistura de E2+NP, sem que, contudo, tenha sido percept\u00edvel qualquer interac\u00e7\u00e3o entre estes compostos. No entanto, observou-se uma ac\u00e7\u00e3o antagonista da BNF (BNF+Cu), que impediu o aumento de lactato observado em resultado da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de A. anguilla ao Cu.\nA an\u00e1lise global dos tr\u00eas par\u00e2metros indicadores de stresse revelou a glucose plasm\u00e1tica como o par\u00e2metro mais sens\u00edvel face \u00e0s situa\u00e7\u00f5es de contamina\u00e7\u00e3o testadas.\nA frequ\u00eancia de ANE foi avaliada em todos estes cap\u00edtulos (VII a IX) como indicador de genotoxicidade. Assim, a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de D. labrax a BNF+E2 e a BNF+NP (4 e 8 h) induziram um aumento de ANE. Uma vez que a ac\u00e7\u00e3o genot\u00f3xica da BNF n\u00e3o foi alterada por exposi\u00e7\u00e3o com o E2 ou NP, este efeito n\u00e3o poder\u00e1 ser atribu\u00eddo a qualquer tipo de interac\u00e7\u00e3o, mas sim \u00e0 BNF. Resultados semelhantes foram anteriormente observados na mesma esp\u00e9cie por Gravato e Santos (2002b). Contudo, a extens\u00e3o da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o at\u00e9 24 h revela tamb\u00e9m o desaparecimento total das ANE.\nA determina\u00e7\u00e3o de v\u00e1rios par\u00e2metros hep\u00e1ticos de biotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o de fase I (EROD e P450) e fase II (GST), assim como a actividade de ALT e o \u00edndice hepato-som\u00e1tico (IHS) foram levadas a cabo nos cap\u00edtulos VII e VIII. Assim, a interfer\u00eancia de xeno/estrog\u00e9nios com reconhecido potencial inibidor da actividade de EROD tal como o E2 ou NP sobre a ac\u00e7\u00e3o da BNF, um t\u00edpico indutor desta actividade foi investigada no cap\u00edtulo VII. Observou-se que ambos os xeno/estrog\u00e9nios reduziram a ac\u00e7\u00e3o indutora da actividade de EROD da BNF em D. labrax. No cap\u00edtulo VIII, a mistura E2+NP teve a capacidade de afectar a express\u00e3o constitutiva do CYP1A, medida pela diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da actividade de EROD em S. aurata. N\u00e3o obstante, este efeito n\u00e3o pode ser atribu\u00eddo \u00e0 mistura, dado que um efeito semelhante foi observado ap\u00f3s exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a E2. Considerando estes resultados, conclui-se que a capacidade dos peixes metabolizarem HAP ou outros substratos do CYP1A poder\u00e1 vir a ser alterada pela presen\u00e7a de xeno/estrog\u00e9nios na \u00e1gua. Esta interfer\u00eancia, para al\u00e9m de constituir um dist\u00farbio na capacidade metab\u00f3lica dos peixes, poder\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m aumentar a possibilidade de interpreta\u00e7\u00f5es err\u00f3neas, acerca da condi\u00e7\u00e3o dos ecossistemas, com base apenas em dados relativos ao CYP1A.\nDe uma forma geral, as interfer\u00eancias observadas ao n\u00edvel da actividade de EROD n\u00e3o se traduziram numa ac\u00e7\u00e3o semelhante ao n\u00edvel do conte\u00fado em citocromo P450, uma vez que este se manteve inalterado, tornando-se assim dif\u00edcil estabelecer uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre estes dois par\u00e2metros.\nRelativamente \u00e0 actividade hep\u00e1tica da GST em D. labrax, a import\u00e2ncia da mistura de compostos ficou patente na redu\u00e7\u00e3o desta actividade observada ap\u00f3s exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a BNF+NP, uma vez que considerados isoladamente n\u00e3o demonstraram essa capacidade (cap\u00edtulo VII). No cap\u00edtulo VIII, observou-se em S. aurata um aumento da actividade da GST para a mistura de E2+NP, o que resultou da ac\u00e7\u00e3o individual do E2. Este efeito sugere um aumento do catabolismo hep\u00e1tico de\nNo cap\u00edtulo IX, investigaram-se as respostas ao n\u00edvel do eixo HPT perante a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o sequencial a BNF e a dois metais pesados (Cr e Cu). As altera\u00e7\u00f5es registadas dizem respeito a processos ao n\u00edvel da tir\u00f3ide, ou a jusante desta, uma vez que, a TSH permaneceu inalterada. A T4 decresceu no plasma de peixes expostos quer a BNF+Cr quer a BNF+Cu, sendo identific\u00e1vel uma ac\u00e7\u00e3o sinerg\u00edstica entre a BNF e o Cu em que a pr\u00e9-exposi\u00e7\u00e3o potenciou o efeito do Cu. Os presentes resultados corroboram dados anteriores em que peixes expostos a um ambiente polu\u00eddo por HAP e metais pesados apresentavam n\u00edveis plasm\u00e1ticos de T4 significativamente baixos (Hontela et al., 1995).\nA import\u00e2ncia da pr\u00e9-exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a BNF na ac\u00e7\u00e3o do Cr e do Cu sobre a T3 n\u00e3o foi, de uma forma geral, percept\u00edvel; contudo, no caso da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a 100 pM Cr a interfer\u00eancia da pr\u00e9-exposi\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o pode ser exclu\u00edda uma vez que os n\u00edveis de T3 baixaram relativamente \u00e0 exposi\u00e7\u00e3o isolada a 100 pM Cr.\n3.\tEXPOSI\u00c7\u00d5ES IN SITU A AMBIENTES POLU\u00cdDOS\nEste ponto corresponde a exposi\u00e7\u00f5es in situ, englobando os cap\u00edtulos X e XI, cujas vantagens foram previamente apresentadas no ponto 3 da introdu\u00e7\u00e3o geral. Foram seleccionados tr\u00eas ecossistemas aqu\u00e1ticos, com natureza e graus de polui\u00e7\u00e3o distintos, de forma a permitir o estudo de respostas perante exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a situa\u00e7\u00f5es reais de contamina\u00e7\u00e3o por misturas de xenobi\u00f3ticos. Assim, escolheu-se uma zona portu\u00e1ria de longo curso, situada na Ria de Aveiro, tipicamente contaminada por HAP, metais pesados e compostos organoest\u00e2nicos e ainda uma zona do rio Vouga que durante v\u00e1rias d\u00e9cadas foi receptora de efluentes de uma unidade de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de pasta de papel (cap\u00edtulo X). No rio Vouga, pretendeu-se avaliar o efeito dos contaminantes remanescentes nos sedimentos sobre A. anguilla, ap\u00f3s o desvio do efluente para o oceano Atl\u00e2ntico, como uma medida da recupera\u00e7\u00e3o do ecossistema. Por fim, escolheu-se um ecossistema de \u00e1gua doce - Pateira de Fermentelos - alvo de efluentes dom\u00e9sticos e industriais, assim como de lixiviados agr\u00edcolas, n\u00e3o havendo refer\u00eancia a estudos relativos aos efeitos desta m\u00faltipla contamina\u00e7\u00e3o sobre a ictiofauna. Assim, o trabalho da Pateira de Fermentelos inseriu-se na primeira campanha de biomonitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o recorrendo a uma esp\u00e9cie representativa da ictiofauna daquele ecossistema.\nEm qualquer dos locais de estudo seleccionados foram realizadas exposi\u00e7\u00f5es de curto prazo, usando A. anguilla como organismo indicador, pelas raz\u00f5es apresentadas anteriormente. Foram estudados indicadores de stresse como o cortisol, glucose e lactato plasm\u00e1ticos em A. anguilla exposta nos tr\u00eas ecossistemas referidos (cap\u00edtulos X e XI). A biotransforma\u00e7\u00e3o hep\u00e1tica, genotoxicidade, hormonas do eixo HPT e E2 no plasma foram tamb\u00e9m avaliados no estudo da Pateira de Fermentelos (cap\u00edtulo XI). Os indicadores de stresse avaliados mostraram altera\u00e7\u00f5es que se enquadram no perfil t\u00edpico de resposta, ou seja aumento simult\u00e2neo de cortisol, glucose e lactato plasm\u00e1ticos, nos tr\u00eas ecossistemas avaliados, com excep\u00e7\u00e3o do lactato que se manteve inalterado no caso da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o na Pateira de Fermentelos. A simultaneidade no aumento de glucose e cortisol poder\u00e1 ser indicadora de indu\u00e7\u00e3o da gluconeog\u00e9nese, resultante da ac\u00e7\u00e3o do cortisol. No caso\nda exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a \u00e1guas contaminadas por EPP observou-se um retorno do cortisol e da glucose plasm\u00e1ticos para os n\u00edveis do controlo das 8 para as 48 h de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o, o que pode ser interpretado como um processo adaptativo. Contudo, em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a \u00e1guas portu\u00e1rias n\u00e3o se verificou o processo de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o anteriormente descrito. As diferen\u00e7as observadas sugerem que os mecanismos de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o dependem do tipo de contaminantes presentes nos locais de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o.\nOs dados relativos ao rio Vouga revelaram que, mesmo ap\u00f3s dois anos do desvio do EPP, persistem no sedimento contaminantes capazes de induzir altera\u00e7\u00f5es de stresse nos peixes.\nO comportamento destes tr\u00eas par\u00e2metros confirmou a sua capacidade de sinalizar a presen\u00e7a de agentes de stresse de diferentes naturezas, real\u00e7ando contudo a sua inespecificidade.\nNa exposi\u00e7\u00e3o in situ na Pateira de Fermentelos observou-se tamb\u00e9m uma tend\u00eancia geral para a diminui\u00e7\u00e3o de T3, confirmada com o seu decr\u00e9scimo significativo no local mais pr\u00f3ximo da principal fonte de polui\u00e7\u00e3o (Ria C\u00e9rtima), sem ser contudo acompanhada por altera\u00e7\u00f5es nos n\u00edveis plasm\u00e1ticos de TSH e T4. Esta diminui\u00e7\u00e3o de T3 no plasma poder\u00e1 ser devida, directamente, \u00e0 ac\u00e7\u00e3o de contaminantes como metais pesados e pesticidas, ou ainda derivar, indirectamente, do aumento do cortisol, tendo sido anteriormente demonstrado que peixes com n\u00edveis elevados de cortisol apresentavam decr\u00e9scimos dos n\u00edveis de T3 no plasma (Redding et al., 1986; Brown et al., 1991).\nNo que diz respeito \u00e0 presen\u00e7a de E2 no plasma, observou-se um aumento significativo em dois locais da Pateira de Fermentelos, indicando a presen\u00e7a desta hormona \u201cnatural\u201d em n\u00edveis elevados na \u00e1gua, sem que seja compreens\u00edvel a rela\u00e7\u00e3o com a dist\u00e2ncia ao principal afluente de contamina\u00e7\u00e3o.\nOs peixes expostos na Pateira de Fermentelos n\u00e3o revelaram qualquer altera\u00e7\u00e3o na actividade de EROD, sugerindo a aus\u00eancia de moduladores do CYP1A. No entanto, tendo em considera\u00e7\u00e3o o \u201ccocktail\u201d de contaminantes que existe na Pateira de Fermentelos, n\u00e3o se pode excluir a possibilidade da ocorr\u00eancia de um equil\u00edbrio entre potenciais indutores (ex. pesticidas) e inibidores do CYP1A1 (ex.\nGlobalmente, os dados obtidos nas exposi\u00e7\u00f5es in situ na Pateira de Fermentelos, forneceram fortes indica\u00e7\u00f5es do grau de contamina\u00e7\u00e3o deste ecossistema.\n4.\tAPRECIA\u00c7\u00c3O GLOBAL E PERSPECTIVAS FUTURAS\nOs dados resultantes da presente tese permitiram um melhor conhecimento do potencial t\u00f3xico de diferentes contaminantes, de grande relev\u00e2ncia ambiental, cuja import\u00e2ncia surge acrescida pela escassez de informa\u00e7\u00e3o dispon\u00edvel no que respeita aos par\u00e2metros estudados. Os presentes dados contribu\u00edram ainda para um melhor entendimento dos processos toxicol\u00f3gicos em peixes, particularmente como resultado da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de uma bateria de biomarcadores, distribu\u00eddos por diferentes n\u00edveis biol\u00f3gicos e pelo facto de se ter explorado a interfer\u00eancia de misturas ou exposi\u00e7\u00f5es sequenciais a diferentes classes de xenobi\u00f3ticos.\nOs resultados comprovaram a exist\u00eancia de interac\u00e7\u00f5es de compostos, n\u00e3o sendo estas contudo previs\u00edveis com base apenas nas caracter\u00edsticas das classes dos compostos envolvidos. As interac\u00e7\u00f5es mostraram ser tamb\u00e9m fortemente condicionadas pelas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es relativas dos compostos em causa. A diversidade de par\u00e2metros estudados permitiu ainda conhecer melhor a interdepend\u00eancia entre respostas, contribuindo para um conhecimento integrado da resposta dos peixes a contaminantes.\nAs exposi\u00e7\u00f5es in situ de A. anguilla demonstraram a sua aplicabilidade na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do estado de tr\u00eas ecossistemas distintos caracterizados por diferentes tipos de contamina\u00e7\u00e3o. Contudo, nem sempre foi percept\u00edvel uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o com a dist\u00e2ncia \u00e0 principal fonte de polui\u00e7\u00e3o. Assim, este tipo de biomonitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o apesar da sua aplicabilidade poder\u00e1 suscitar novas quest\u00f5es, sempre que elevadas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de diferentes contaminantes xenobi\u00f3ticos alterarem o sentido das respostas, atrav\u00e9s da ocorr\u00eancia de interac\u00e7\u00f5es que conduzam a situa\u00e7\u00f5es de antagonismo ou sinergismo.\nSem pretender diminuir a import\u00e2ncia da adop\u00e7\u00e3o de biomarcadores, que a presente tese corrobora, os dados obtidos real\u00e7am a necessidade da sua complementa\u00e7\u00e3o com indicadores qu\u00edmicos relativos \u00e0 quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos contaminantes xenobi\u00f3ticos na \u00e1gua, sedimentos e tecidos dos peixes.\nUma das linhas naturais de evolu\u00e7\u00e3o do presente trabalho diria respeito \u00e0 aplica\u00e7\u00e3o da bateria de par\u00e2metros utilizada, a diferentes esp\u00e9cies pisc\u00edcolas\nAs exposi\u00e7\u00f5es levadas a cabo foram de curto prazo, pelo que para se poder assumir de forma mais definitiva a conclus\u00e3o acerca dos efeitos dos contaminantes testados, dever\u00e1 considerar-se dados de exposi\u00e7\u00f5es mais longas, com amostragens frequentes nesse intervalo de tempo, n\u00e3o inclu\u00eddas na presente tese e que poder\u00e3o ser levadas a cabo em trabalhos subsequentes.\nAs esp\u00e9cies adoptadas como organismos teste demonstraram a sua aplicabilidade no presente contexto, devendo considerar-se para o caso de A. anguilla e de D. labrax como um facto confirmado.
