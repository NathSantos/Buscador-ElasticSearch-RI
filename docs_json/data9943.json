The recent downturn in the oil and gas (O&amp;G) market \nhas been creating some speculations where M&amp;A arises as a way to join companies that together \ncan be more efficient in handling periods of low prices. In fact, this is a great opportunity for those \nwith solid financial positions to invest in undervalued companies, and thus, strengthen their \ncompetitiveness in the future. \n\nThis dissertation focuses in assessing the potential value added from a deal between ExxonMobil \nand Anadarko. The former with an integrated business model and a strong balance sheet, and the \nlatter, solely dependent on the upstream segment which means being more exposed to fluctuations \nin oil prices. \n\nThereafter, an in-depth company and industry analysis is conducted in order to establish which \nassumptions to apply to the valuation methods. The individual and combined analysis is supported \nby a literature review on valuation and M&amp;A. Based on a theoretical framework, the merged entity \nvaluation is developed, followed by a proposed price, method of payment and acquisition strategy.  \n\nAnadarko\u2019s standalone valuation suggests that its average share price during 2015 is undervalued \nwith 13% upside potential. Due to synergies of $33,96Bn, the proposed deal has a premium of 49% \nand the final suggestion being an all-cash offer. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 2  \n\nResumo \nV\u00e1rias s\u00e3o as raz\u00f5es apontadas para justificar fus\u00f5es e aquisi\u00e7\u00f5es, mas todas t\u00eam subjacente o \npressuposto da cria\u00e7\u00e3o de valor para os acionistas. Num per\u00edodo de queda hist\u00f3rica do pre\u00e7o do \npetr\u00f3leo, estas surgem como uma alternativa para a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de estruturas mais eficientes. A \nfragilidade financeira experienciada pelo setor emerge tamb\u00e9m como uma oportunidade. Empresas \nmenos vulner\u00e1veis \u00e0s oscila\u00e7\u00f5es dos pre\u00e7os podem aumentar a sua competitividade futura \ninvestindo em empresas que viram o seu valor de mercado desvalorizar significativamente. \n\nAssim, esta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o foca-se na an\u00e1lise da cria\u00e7\u00e3o de valor que pode resultar da aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o da \nAnadarko, uma empresa unicamente dependente da explora\u00e7\u00e3o e produ\u00e7\u00e3o de petr\u00f3leo, pela \nExxonMobil, com um modelo de neg\u00f3cios integrado que vai desde a explora\u00e7\u00e3o at\u00e9 \u00e0 \ncomercializa\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nUma an\u00e1lise detalhada \u00e0 ind\u00fastria e a ambas as empresas permite estabelecer os pressupostos \nnecess\u00e1rios para o desenvolvimento dos modelos de avalia\u00e7\u00e3o e da estrat\u00e9gia de aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o. \nAdicionalmente, uma an\u00e1lise da literatura acad\u00e9mica sobre modelos de avalia\u00e7\u00e3o e fus\u00f5es e \naquisi\u00e7\u00f5es sustenta os modelos desenvolvidos, bem como as recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es relativas ao pre\u00e7o, \nmodo de pagamento e estrat\u00e9gia de aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o.  \nA avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da Anadarko sugere que o pre\u00e7o m\u00e9dio por a\u00e7\u00e3o verificado ao longo do ano de 2015 \nest\u00e1 subavaliado em 13%. Assim, com sinergias avaliadas em $33,96 bili\u00f5es, a aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o proposta \ntem um premium de 49% e dever\u00e1 ser paga unicamente em dinheiro.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 3  \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \nThe author would like to express her sincere gratitude to Professor Ant\u00f3nio Assun\u00e7\u00e3o, the \nDissertation Advisor, for the constant availability, helpful feedback and motivation.

in the oil and gas (O&amp;G) market has been creating some speculations about \n\nMerger and Acquisitions (M&amp;A) deals between companies with strong balance sheets and others \n\nwhich are struggling with financial pressure. Those with solid financial positions invest in \n\nundervalued companies and thus strengthen their competitive position in the future, which is the \n\ncase with ExxonMobil and Anadarko. \n\nBoth are O&amp;G companies based in the United States with operations worldwide. However, \n\nExxonMobil has an integrated business model which has so far proven to be strong enough to deal \n\nwith the fluctuations of oil prices. In contrast, Anadarko is entirely dependent on its upstream \n\nsegment, and consequently, it has been struggling with the current historically low commodity \n\nprices. \n\nA consolidation process between the two companies requires an extensive look at the strategic and \n\nfinancial reasoning behind it. In order to proceed with the evaluation of this deal a literature review \n\nhas been developed, and covers the existing academic literature about valuation methods and an \n\nanalysis of the most common issues related to M&amp;A deals. These foundations will be crucial to \n\ndevelop the forecast models and to propose the best acquisition strategy and payment methods. \n\nThereafter, an in-depth industry and company analysis will be conducted in order to establish the \n\nright assumptions to develop the forecast for the standalone valuations. Once the individual \n\nanalysis is done, an integrated perspective will be developed in order to evaluate the consolidation \n\nbenefits. \n\nFinally, the last section focuses on the details of the acquisition process, providing the final \n\nrecommendations in terms of premium, method of payment and acquisition strategy.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 16  \n\nLiterature Review  \n1. Valuation Overview \n\nWhile conceptually there is one correct value for a firm, in practice there are multiple ways of \n\ncalculating it. As a result, the important question is which valuation technique offers the easiest \n\nand most accurate way which is comparable against other models. \n\n1.1. Cash-Flow Methodology \n\nThe DCF method emerged in the 1970s as the best way to value corporate assets. The logic behind \n\nthis method is the relationship between present and future value, where timing and risk need to take \n\nplace following the uncertainty of the future business CF. This uncertainty is translated in an \n\nopportunity cost represented by the time value and the risk premium. The following topics will \n\nanalyse some of the different variations of DCF methods. \n\nFour different DCF approaches are based on the nature of the used CF and the discount rate: APV, \n\nCCF, FCFF and CFE (Oded &amp; Michel, 2007). The first three are based on EV and the latter on \n\nequity values. The DDM is another CF method that follows an equity based approach. \n\n1.1.1. Equity Value Perspective: DDM \n\nFoerster and Saap (2005) considered the DDM a useful approach to value the equity of firms with \n\nmature dividend-payment polices by discounting all future expected dividend payments, supported \n\nby the intrinsic assumption that changes in dividends explain changes in asset prices.  \n\nThe generalized DDM approach was later replaced by the Gordon Growth Model that relies on the \n\nassumption of constant dividend growth: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHowever, a constant growth is not always applicable due to different life cycles and consequently, \n\nthis model is only suitable for companies with stable growth rates (Damodaran, 2005).  \n\nGordon growth DDM Generalized DDM \n\n =\n??\n\n(1 +??)\n?\n\n?\n\n?=1\n\n                                        =\n?0(1 + ?)\n\n?\n\n(????)\n?\n\n?\n\n?=1\n\n \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 17  \n\nDespite some studies continuing to present DDM as a reliable method, studies with longer time \n\nseries, which are considered to be more reliable, tend to question these results. Since the payout \n\nratio is dependent on many factors, forecasting future dividends requires a significant amount of \n\nspeculation.  \n\n1.1.2. EV Perspective: APV and WACC \n\nThe more common version of the DCF is based on the WACC, a discount rate that applies the debt \n\nand equity costs to the capital structure ratios with the respective adjustment for the tax shield. The \n\nsimplicity of WACC has the drawback of considering the interest tax shield straight away and not \n\ntaking into account the potential changes in the company\u2019s capital structure over time. \n\nIn order to avoid misevaluation, complex capital structures requiring a WACC should be adjusted \n\nper project and period. Cash, timing and risk have distinctive structural features that WACC does \n\nnot recognize in a very accurate way and consequently, other complementary tools should be \n\nconsidered (Luehrman, 1907). However, Oded &amp; Michel (2007) argued that when the debt \n\nrebalancing policy is applied consistently, all valuation methods produce equivalent results.  \n\nHowever, the APV, as suggested by Stewart Myers from MIT, is one of the proposed models that \n\naccording to Luehrman (1997) outperforms WACC by considering separated CF from business \n\noperations and financing strategies. For Luehrman (1997) \u201cAPV always works when WACC does, \n\nand sometimes when WACC does not\u201d.  \n\nWhen executing the APV method, the first step is to determine the forecasted CF, which is then \n\ndiscounted as if the company was fully financed by equity. The value associated with the financing \n\nprogramme is evaluated separately.  \n\nHowever, there is no consensus amongst academics for the discount rate used to value the financing \n\nprogramme. The risk associated with the tax shields is seen by some academics as the same as debt \n\nobligations and therefore, the tax shields should be discounted using the cost of debt. Whereas \n\nothers agree that the use of leverage will be dependent on the operational performance, and \n\ntherefore, should be discounted at the same discount rate as operational CFs. Grinblatt and Titman \n\n(2002) argued that the tax shield should be discounted with different discount rates based on the \n\nrebalancing assumption.  \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 18  \n\nPutting both pieces together, business operations CFs and the value of the financing side effects, \n\nvaluation through APV is obtained. \n\n1.1.3. Critical issues related with DCF methods \n\n1.1.3.1. CAPM \n\nThe CAPM establishes the relation between risk and expected return, calculated through the sum \n\nof risk-free (rf), which represents the time value of money, with the product between the systematic \n\nrisk (?) and the risk premium required by investors (rm-rf). In fact, under this approach investors \n\nare solely concerned with the systematic risk, mathematically translated by the covariance between \n\nthe stock and the market returns.  \n\nDespite contradictory academic evidence and some more modern approaches (e.g. arbitrage pricing \n\ntheory) CAMP is still one of the most accepted methods to calculate the cost of equity.  \n\nGene Fama and Ken French (1992) argued that the stock returns were related with the size and \n\nbook-to-market ratios of the firm, which contradict the systematic risk measure denoted by CAPM. \n\nHowever, later Kaplan and Ruback (1996) developed a study based on CAPM which proves that \n\nthe implied risk premium is positively related to firm and industry betas, as opposed to firm size or \n\npre-transaction book-to-market ratios. \n\n1.1.3.2. Risk-Free Rate \n\nDue to the more frequently errors associated with risk-free determination (Fern\u00e1ndez, 2004) it is \n\ndesirable to use a risk free rate with the same duration of the analysed cash-flows. \n\n1.1.3.3. Risk-Premium \n\nThere is some disagreement between which is the best approach: LT arithmetic average (1) or a \n\ngeometric average (2) of the historical return spread between a stock market index and risk-free \n\nbonds.  \n\nKaplan &amp; Ruback (1996) developed a study based on the LT arithmetic average approach (1), the \n\nmost common in finance texts, which proved that APV works best with arithmetic average. For \n\nDCF methods, there was no evidence that the arithmetic approach would have improved its \n\nperformance. However, Fern\u00e1ndez (2004) argued that \u201cthe required MRP is an expectation and \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 19  \n\nhas little to do with history\u201d, but since he did not present any alternative, this analysis will use the \n\narithmetic average. \n\n1.1.3.4. Beta \n\nThere are two main issues that should be pointed out for beta: the time period and the source of the \n\nmarket index.  \n\nBeta estimation is based upon historical betas but Fern\u00e1ndez (2004) and Damodaran (2001) \n\nsupported that calculated betas change dramatically and depend on the period used to estimate \n\nthem. They ignore potential recent variations on the business operation, leverage and other \n\nimportant variables that impacts the firm\u2019s systematic risk. Thus, Damodaran (2002) recommended \n\nthe use of bottom-up betas, which includes recent updates in operating and leverage levels. \n\nMeasuring the systematic risk (?) could follow three different approaches in terms of source that \n\nwere applied by Kaplan &amp; Ruback (1996): firm (1), industry (2) and market (3). This study proved \n\nthat the firm-based method is the less accurate, with industry and market outperforming it. The \n\nstatistical noise of individual beta made industry betas more stable and consistent.  \n\nCopeland, T. et al. (1991) suggested using the public estimation of beta for listed companies, while \n\nstill taking into account the existing industry betas and other reliable sources to validate this \n\nassumption. The reasoning behind validation also aligns with the conclusion of Kaplan &amp; Ruback, \n\n(1996) that individual beta estimates vary widely and industry average beta are usually more \n\nreliable. \n\nNevertheless, the challenge here is to find reliable comparable companies able to guarantee \n\nconsistency and a representative sample. \n\n1.1.3.5. Terminal Value \n\nThe TV is calculated though a terminal CF that is assumed to grow in perpetuity at a constant \n\nnominal growth rate (Kaplan &amp; Ruback, 1996). It carries a significant weight on the present value \n\nof any valuation. Consequently, its underlying assumptions are very important and a sensitivity \n\nanalysis is greatly recommended. \n\nNormally, the TV proceeds a forecasting time frame that is defined individually, based on the \n\nspecifications of each project or business stage in terms of CAPEX. Considering the perpetuity \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 20  \n\ngrowth rate, CAPEX should be aligned with D&amp;A (Kaplan &amp; Ruback, 1996) and should also reflect \n\nthe nominal GDP growth (Steiger, 2008). \n\n1.1.4. Return-based Approach  \n\nThe return-based logic has two main approaches: ROE and EVA. Dynamic ROE, the equity \n\napproach, is calculated based on the current BV plus the discounted future excess returns. On the \n\nother hand, the EVA uses the EV approach. EVA is achieved by the sum of the current capital \n\nstock plus the discounted value of future EVA. Some academics argue that the inconsistency of the \n\nusage of BV and the imperfections between EVA and stock returns make these approaches less \n\nused as a firm valuation tool. \n\n1.2. Option Theory \n\nThe high uncertainties and risks at every stage of petroleum projects, along with limited maturities, \n\nmake O&amp;G companies considerably hard to value. Real options are especially valuable for this \n\nindustry since it provides different methods to value such uncertainties (Copeland &amp; Keenan, \n\n1998), Black-Scholes and the Binomial model being the most important.  \n\nLuehrman (1997) considered Black-Scholes, a model developed by Fischer Black and Myron \n\nScholes and modified by Robert Merton (Black &amp; Scholes, 1973), his favourite because of its \n\nversatility and simplicity. However, in this analysis, the option theory will not be considered since \n\nit would not be suitable to apply it to an integrated company like ExxonMobil. \n\n1.3. Multiples \n\nWhereas the previous valuation methods are based on assumptions related with the firm being \n\nvalued, relative valuation estimates the company\u2019s value based on historical markets and \n\ntransaction values of comparable companies. However, both types of valuation demand important \n\nassumptions: that comparable companies are aligned in terms of growth and risk. The market-based \n\napproach assumes that the value of comparable companies will fluctuate in direct proportion to the \n\nvarying performance measurements used (Kaplan &amp; Ruback, 1996). Foushee et al (2012) adds that \n\ntruly comparable companies also have to compete in the same markets. According to Kaplan and \n\nRuback (1996) having these conditions fulfilled, the relative valuation approach can be valuable \n\nsince it already includes updated market expectations. \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 21  \n\nThe market multiples can also be separated based on their fundamental determination. Investors \n\ntend to use enterprise-value multiples since they are not manipulated by differences in the capital \n\nstructure (Foushee, et al., 2012). Goedhart et al (2005) highlight that EV-to-EBITDA is also \n\npreferred because it does not take into account non-operating expenses.  \n\nDespite multiples providing the advantage of including market expectations, they also have their \n\nweaknesses. Kaplan and Ruback proved that DCF methods were more accurate, but the most \n\nreliable estimates were the ones that used both. \n\n2. M&amp;A Issues \n\n2.1. Synergies \n\nThe rationale behind M&amp;A is essentially explained by the synergies that arise from combining two \n\nfirms.  \n\nDamodaran (2005) grouped synergies into operating and financial synergies. Operating Synergies \n\nincludes economies of scale, higher bargaining power, growth opportunities and a combination of \n\ndifferent operating strengths, all with the potential outcome of an increased operating income. \n\nFinancial Synergies could arise from a combination of firms with excess cash and limited project \n\nopportunities, higher debt capacity and diversification, which could result in higher cash-flows or \n\nlower cost of capital. A study conducted by Bhide (1993) concluded that for one third of takeovers, \n\noperating synergy was the primary driver. \n\nHowever, several challenges are posed when it comes to their effective implementation. In terms \n\nof financial synergies, the ones that arise from diversification tend to fail in creating value and \n\nconsequently, markets usually react negatively to the announcement of diversifying acquisitions \n\n(Doukas, et al., 2001).  \n\nIn fact, there are some academics that propose synergy analyses based on the difficultness of \n\nachieving them. Cullian, et al. (2004) proposed an interesting framework that mapped synergies \n\naccording to their easiness in terms of implementation. Eccles, et al. (1999) pointed out that due to \n\nthe difficulty in estimating revenue synergies, some analysts neither include nor discount them \n\nheavily.  \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 22  \n\nDamodaran (2005) proposed a way to value synergies based on three steps: value the firms \n\nindependently (1); value of combined firm with no synergy (2) and revalued the combined firm \n\nwith synergies (3), where the difference between (2) and (3) is the value of synergies. However, \n\nthe forecasting CF of the combining firms should be discounted at an appropriate rate that is \n\nimposed on the new firm. \n\nCullian, et al. (2004) also highlights the importance of a rigorous DD process that identifies the \n\nmost common financial tricks, such as overoptimistic projections. In the end, it is the acquisition \n\nprice that will determine whether an acquisition result is value increasing or value destroying. \n\n2.2. The Announcement reactions and Post-merger results  \n\nMckinsey and Co. developed a study which intended to analyse if the return on the amount invested \n\nin an acquisition exceeded the cost of capital, and if the acquisition helped the parent companies \n\noutperform. The study proved that around 48% failed both tests and 10% failed at least one test. \n\nEccles, et al. (1999) also concluded that the total market-adjusted return of the acquirer went down \n\nat the time of the announcement for 59% of the deals. \n\nSuch negative reactions of the markets are a result of investor scepticism regarding the acquirer\u2019s \n\nability to sustain the original value of each company and achieve the synergies needed to justify \n\nthe premium of that acquisition (Sirower &amp; Sahni, 2006).  \n\nIn order to avoid mistakes of excess premium, Sirower and Sahni (2006) created an important \n\nguideline, the MTP line, which defines the up-limit of the acquirer, and any deal below the MTP \n\nline is considered worthless. \n\nSirower and Sahni (2006) also proposed a three-three matrix which results in three types of deals: \n\njoining companies with the same capabilities (cost synergies); or companies with different \n\ncapabilities (revenue synergies); and deals that bring completely new capabilities (both).  \n\nIn contrast with the scepticism exposed above, Bruner (2014) argues against them with evidence \n\nthat M&amp;A does pay-off: there is a tendency to \u201cexaggerate the extent of failure\u201d without a location-\n\nbased approach which goes beyond the simple goals-outcome analysis. For Bruce (2014) all M&amp;A \n\nis local. \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 23  \n\nIn conclusion, despite several studies supporting the failure of M&amp;A, the analysts should evaluate \n\ncase by case without creating straightforward assumptions from a particular sample. It is crucial to \n\nadopt the best DD and post-merger approach while bearing in mind the main reasons for the failure \n\nof historical cases.  \n\n2.3. Method of Payment  \n\nRegarding payment methods, stock tends to be associated with negative returns due to the market \n\nsignal of managers believing that shares are overpriced.  \n\nTherefore, when payments are due in cash, the returns of target shareholders are significantly high \n\nin comparison with stock. In terms of materiality, the payments in stock are lower, despite the \n\nsignificantly positive returns (Bruner, 2014). Bruner (2014) also highlighted that normally larger \n\ndeals are likely to step up the positive and negative returns, for cash and stock payment methods \n\nrespectively.  \n\nThe main issue associated with the payment method is that with cash, the risk is solely on the buyer \n\nside. While in stock transactions, the targets share the risk (Rappaport &amp; Sirower, 1999). \n\n2.4. Premium \n\nThe most unsuccessful cases of M&amp;A resulted from the inflated premiums paid by companies.  The \n\nhigh premiums can be justified in part by some failure in the DD process or post-merger issues.  \n\nDamodaran (2005) presented three possible explanations why bidders overpay: a biased evaluation \n\nprocess, managerial hubris and failure to have a plan to effectively implement synergies. Normally, \n\nthis overpayment is even larger in hostile acquisitions and tender offers (Huang &amp; Walkling, 1987). \n\nHowever, the premiums paid are in part a reflection of the market conditions. An analysis \n\nconducted by Jarrell, Brickley and Netter (1998) concluded that premiums ranged between 19% \n\nand 35% between 1980 and 1985, suggesting that premiums are not only dependent on the value \n\nof synergies. \n\nFurthermore, Dennis &amp; McConnell (1986) developed a study based on the 10 days before and after \n\nthe announcement of an acquisition, showing that in fact nearly half the premium is already \n\nreflected in the acquisition price (Figure-1). \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 24  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIndustry Overview  \n1. Market Conditions and Business Environment  \n\nThe proposed acquisition is analyzed under a context of substantial uncertainty for O&amp;G \n\ncompanies. Until 2014, normal price levels ranged between $90-100/barrel, currently, prices are \n\nbelow $40/barrel: upstream O&amp;G companies have been facing huge challenges with revenues \n\ndropping by more than 50%. \n\nThe upstream, oilfield services and midstream sectors are the ones which have suffered intense CF \n\npressure as opposed to downstream sectors which have profited from higher refining margins. \n\nChanges in supply and demand help justify the plummeting oil prices (Appendix 1). First, there is \n\nthe overproduction of oil in the U.S., and the collapse of China\u2019s economy; second, the global \n\ndecrease in consumption results in rising storage levels, which means global crude oil supply \n\nexceeds demand growth. \n\nEIA predicts that a continuing fall in U.S. oil production throughout 2016, and an economic \n\nretrenchment in countries economically dependent on oil, might significantly reduce their ability \n\nto invest in this sector (IEA, 2015).   \n\nFigure 1 - Cumulative Excess Return to Target Company Stock (Source: Damodaran 2005) \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 25  \n\nThese factors imply that supply will gradually adjust to the current demand levels, though a rapid \n\nrecovery is not anticipated because of the high stock levels.  As a result, upstream companies started \n\nto react with several cost saving measures in 2015. \n\n1.1. Supply and Demand \n\nBesides the ST drivers for supply and demand, others factors such as government policies, \n\ntechnological developments and global climate changes, should also be considered on a medium \n\nand LT perspective (Appendix 2).  \n\nPopulation and economic growth are considered the two biggest drivers for energy demand \n\n(Figure-2): by 2040, global population is expected to grow from 7.2Bn to 9Bn and global GDP will \n\nbe doubled (ExxonMobil, 2016) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Outlook for Energy (ExxonMobil, 2016) predicts that by 2040, oil and NG will continue to \n\nrepresent around 60% of global demand. Globally, the demand for energy is expected to rise 25% \n\nby 2040, 45% of which will be from non-OECD countries (Figure-3).  \n\nFigure 2 - Historical Data for Population Growth (World Population, 2016), \nGDP (GDP, 2016) and Oil Prices (Crude Oil , 2016) \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 26  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn terms of oil, OECD has projected an annual average growth of 1.2% on global demand until \n\n2021 (Table-1). The supply levels have risen throughout 2015, however, due to a significant \n\nnumber of projects deferred and cancelled, the annual average growth rate until 2021 is expected \n\nto be just 0.7% (OECD; IEA, 2016). Following this forecast, supply and demand of oil will only \n\nbe aligned in 2017. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAs for gas, global demand is expected to rise by 50% from 2014 to 2040 (ExxonMobil, 2016) \n\n1.2. Prices \n\nThe golden days where oil companies got over $100/bbl are not likely to reoccur, not even in the \n\nlong term (Appendix 3). NG prices have also declined significantly since 2013. \n\nFigure 3 - Energy Demand per region (ExxonMobil, 2016) \n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\nWorld Demand 94,4 95,6 96,9 98,2 99,3 100,5 101,6\n\nNon-OPEC Supply 57,7 57,1 57 57,6 58,3 58,9 59,7\nOPEC Crude* 32 32,8 33 33 33,2 33,5 33,6\n\nOPEC NGLS etc 6,7 6,9 7 7,1 7,1 7,1 7,2\nTotal World Supply* 96,4 96,7 97 97,8 98,7 99,5 100,5\n\nImplied Stock Change 2 1,1 0,1 -0,4 -0,7 -1 -1,1\n\nTable 1 - World Demand and Supply (OECD; IEA, 2016) \n\n\n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 28  \n\nCompany Analysis \n1. ExxonMobil  \n\n1.1. Overview \n\nExxonMobil is the largest of the vertically integrated oil majors, with divisions and affiliated \n\ncompanies worldwide. This American multinational corporation headquartered in Texas from a \n\nregional U.S. company to the largest publicly traded petroleum and petrochemical enterprise in the \n\nworld.  \n\nWith a well-diversified and integrated portfolio, ExxonMobil achieved their lead market position \n\nwith high-quality operations.  Having upstream, downstream, chemical and NG and power \n\nmarketing as its business segments, and reaching the worldwide market through three well-known \n\nbrands - Exxon, Esso and Mobil - ExxonMobil has been able to reduce their exposure through \n\noperational and geographical diversification. \n\nA. Upstream  \n\nThe upstream segment includes a diverse portfolio of exploration opportunities and production of \n\nconventional, heavy oil, tight gas, shale gas, deepwater NG, arctic and sour gas projects. \n\nExxonMobil currently has active upstream E&amp;P in 36 countries with a leading resources and assets \n\nindustry base. The Americas (35%) and Asia (34%) being the leading locations. \n\nExxonMobil was able to continue to increase its portfolio by adding 1.4Bn OEB (liquids grew by \n\n3.2%, but NG decreased by 6%) and maintain their industry-leading resource base at approximately \n\n91Bn oil equivalent barrels (OEB)  with 16 years shelf life at current production rates (Appendix \n\n6).  \n\nGoing forward, ExxonMobil is planning to complete 10 projects in 2016 and 2017 as its near-term \n\nactivity and its continued work of developing their large unconventional liquids-rich resource base \n\nin the U.S.  \n\nB. Downstream  \n\nExxonMobil downstream operations are market leaders in terms of petroleum products and \n\nfinished lubricants, leveraged by its worldwide distribution network with refining facilities in 14 \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 29  \n\ncountries and with over 5.000 owned/leased retail stations (Appendix 7). ExxonMobil has built a \n\nstrong worldwide distribution network and its results in 2015 proved the value of its integrated \n\nbusiness model.  \n\nExxonMobil is the leader in the industry, with 80% of its refining capacity integrated with chemical \n\nand lube base-stock production facilities, which are translated in important synergies and \n\nsignificant cost optimization. Innovation, world-class brands and an integrated supply chain leaves \n\nExxonMobil in a good position for long-term growth.   \n\nC. Chemical  \n\nFinally, the chemical segment operates in 16 countries, with a major presence in North America \n\n(45%) and Asia Pacific (40%). The company manufactures and sells petrochemicals including \n\nolefins, polyolefin, aromatics, and a wide variety of specialty products.  \n\nGlobally, ExxonMobil is the largest manufacturer of aromatics and one of the largest of olefins, \n\nsome of the highest-growth petrochemical commodities. ExxonMobil has been investing to meet \n\ngrowing demand, especially through integration with nearly 90% of its chemical capacity being \n\nintegrated with large refineries and NG processing plants. The demand for chemical products is \n\nexpected to grow nearly 45% over the next decade and ExxonMobil is projected to double its \n\nexports by 2025. \n\n1.2. Financials \n\nTaking into consideration the industry\u2019s challenging environment, the results of 2015 demonstrated \n\nthat ExxonMobil has a strong financial performance in relation to its peers, partly justified by its \n\nintegrated businesses model and performance efficiency.  \n\nLower commodity prices and higher cost production of non-conventional oil justify the lower \n\nearnings of $16.2Bn, 50.3% less compared with 2014 (Figure-5). As expected, the earnings were \n\ndown mainly as a consequence of upstream activities, which decreased $20Bn from 2014. This \n\ndecrease was offset smoothly with an increase of $3.5Bn in the downstream and $103M in the \n\nchemical segments. \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 30  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEven with lower level of earnings, its performance still reveals that ExxonMobil is a strong \n\ncompany, with assets reaching $336,758Bn and its equity representing 52,5% of assets. Total \n\nliabilities in 2015 were 5% less compared with 2014, however the LTD increased to $19,2Bn which \n\nreflects the issuance of $8Bn of LTD. Moreover, its unused committed ST and LT credit, $6Bn \n\nand $0,4Bn respectively, reinforces ExxonMobil\u2019s financial strength. ExxonMobil\u2019s \n\ncreditworthiness is also translated by its fixed-charge coverage and consolidated debt-to-capital \n\nratios of 17,6 and 18,0, respectively.  \n\nIn terms of liquidity, ExxonMobil also reached a total cash and cash equivalents of $3,7Bn, $1Bn \n\nless than last year. In 2015, cash and cash equivalents were used partly to purchase shares of \n\nExxonMobil stock ($4Bn) and dividends ($12,1Bn). Concerning dilution, the earnings per share \n\nwere $0,67 in 2015, a decrease of 57%.  \n\nThe cash provided by operations and asset sales totalled $33Bn, outperforming its peers \n\n(ExxonMobil, 2016). The company also reached an industry-leading return on average capital \n\nemployed of 7,9% in 2015. However, due to low commodity prices and worldwide oversupply, \n\nExxonMobil reacted immediately by adjusting its investment and lowering its CAPEX to $31,1Bn \n\nin 2015, 19,4% lower than in 2014 (Figure-6). \n\nFigure 5 - Earnings after Income Taxes (Company Annual Reports) \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 31  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNevertheless, even with a more conservative investment approach, ExxonMobil seems to be \n\ncommitted to project execution and effective cost management. ExxonMobil has been investing \n\nthrough the cycle, creating long-term shareholders\u2019 value - its 5-years cumulative total returns \n\nalways being higher than the industry levels prove this (Figure-7). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn general, despite the industry\u2019s downturn, it is possible to acknowledge the superior results of \n\nExxonMobil in relation to the overall industry. \n\nFigure 7 - ExxonMobil's Five-Year Total Cumulative Return \n(Morningstar, 2016) \n\nFigure 6 - ROCE by ExxonMobil and Peers (ExxonMobil, 2016) \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 32  \n\n2. Anadarko \n\n2.1. Overview \n\nAnadarko, founded in 1959, has its \n\nheadquarters in Texas and is one of the \n\nworld\u2019s largest independent E&amp;P \n\ncompanies in the O&amp;G industry. With \n\napproximately 2,1Bn BOE of proved \n\nreserves, Anadarko develops, acquires \n\nand explores oil and NG resources \n\nonshore in the U.S. and in high-potential \n\noffshore worldwide.  \n\nAnadarko\u2019s asset portfolio includes U.S. onshore and Gulf of Mexico. Worldwide, Anadarko has \n\nactivities in Algeria, Ghana, Mozambique, Colombia, the Ivory Coast, New Zealand and Kenya \n\n(Figure-8). \n\nAnadarko is organized in three main segments: O&amp;G E&amp;P, midstream and marketing. According \n\nto the ExxonMobil\u2019s segmentation, these three segments fall under ExxonMobil\u2019s upstream \n\nsegment.  \n\nA. Upstream \n\nThe E&amp;P segment has activities worldwide involving oil, condensate, NG and LNG, but the \n\nmidstream segment is based in the U.S. and is involved in gathering, processing, treating, and \n\ntransporting its own as well as third-party production.  \n\nThe upstream segment has its main activity in the U.S. (89% of sales), where Anadarko\u2019s \n\noperations are resumed to 48 states, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and onshore Alaska (Appendix 8). \n\nInternationally, activities are mainly based in Algeria and Ghana, and also include LNG \n\ndevelopment activities in Mozambique. (Appendix 9).  \n\nIn terms of sales-volumes, the company\u2019s product mix increased to 53% liquids in 2015 compared \n\nwith 49% in 2014, due to the lower production levels of NG since 2013. \n\nFigure 8 - Anadarko's Worldwide Activity (Anadarko Petroleum Corp, 2016) \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 33  \n\nThe gathering, processing, treating and transportation activities are crucial in order to complement \n\nthe company\u2019s production activities with further advantages in terms of cost management, timing \n\ncontrol and value enhancement (Appendix 10). \n\nThe midstream activities are destined both to internal and third-party customers. This segment \n\nincludes the subsidiary WES LP which operates midstream assets (Appendix 11).  \n\nFinally, the marketing segment is responsible for selling Anadarko\u2019s production as well as third-\n\nparty purchased volumes. The company\u2019s activities include oil, NG and NGLs in the U.S., but \n\ninternationally, only oil and NGLs. (Appendix 12). \n\n2.2. Financials \nThe company\u2019s performance during 2015 was highly affected by the lower commodity prices with \n\nsignificant impact on its revenues, operational CF, CAPEX and future growth rates. As opposed to \n\nExxonMobil, Anadarko is entirely dependent on its sales of oil, NG and NGL production, without \n\nan integrated business model to offset its upstream downward slope.  \n\nSince 2014, Anadarko has had a net loss, however, the -$1,75Bn in 2014 contrasts with the loss of \n\n$6,7Bn in 2015 (Appendix 13). The net loss is mainly explained by the 42% decrease in sales \n\nrevenues, following the YOY growth since 2012. In fact, even with the operating income reaching \n\n$8,81Bb ($5,4Bn in 2014), Anadarko was able to reduce its operating expenses by 13% while \n\nsustaining its production levels.  \n\nThe company\u2019s assets have also decreased by almost 24% since 2014 and its capital structure has \n\nfelt the imbalances, with equity representing 33% (37% in 2014) of its assets.  \n\nAs of December 2015, Anadarko had $15,72Bn of LTD. In terms of liquidity, Anadarko had \n\n$4,75Bn of borrowing capacity and $939M of cash available at the end of 2015. Furthermore, \n\nduring 2015 it was also able to monetize $2,0Bn and achieved a decrease of 36% in CAPEX. \n\nThrough these adjustments, Anadarko has been dealing with a more challenging environment \n\nwhich was also reflected in its $1,9Bn cash ($8,5Bn in 2014) from operating activities. \n\nDespite the compromise with enhancing operational efficiencies and reducing CAPEX, its ROCE \n\ndecreased to -21% (6% in 2013).  \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 34  \n\nAs for dividends, Anadarko paid $553M to its common stockholders in 2015 ($505M in 2014). \n\nThe cumulative 5-year total return of Anadarko\u2019s common stock compared with the S&amp;P500 index \n\nand a peer group of 11 companies1 was lower than the industry levels, as well as the S&amp;P 500, \n\nespecially since 2012 (Figure-9). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStandalone Firm\u2019s Valuation \nIn this section, ExxonMobil and Anadarko\u2019s valuation will be developed separately through the \n\nAPV, WACC and Relative Valuation. \n\nThe APV and WACC valuation models are established through analyses of the company\u2019s \n\nperformance over the last five years and forecast for the next ten years. The last five years\u2019 \n\nperformance enables us to disregard not only some financial crisis effects, but more importantly, \n\nthe lower oil commodity prices of late. Due to the lowest of oil prices in 2015, and the steady \n\ngrowth expected for the coming years, it is reasonable to forecast the CF for 10 years, when the \n\nmain growth driver of both companies will achieve stable and sustainable price levels again.  \n\nThe relative valuation approach will be developed based on a peer group analysis and an overall \n\nindustry perspective.  \n\nFinally, considering the dependency of the overall industry performance on oil commodity price, \n\nit is important to consider the main macroeconomic drivers applied to the forecast models. \n\n                                                 \n1 Peer group: Apache Corporation; Chevron Corporation; ConocoPhillips; Devon Energy Corporation; EOG Resources, Inc.; Hess \nCorporation; Marathon Oil Corporation; Murphy Oil Corporation; Noble Energy, Inc.; Occidental Petroleum Corporation; and \nPioneer Natural Resources Company. \n\nFigure 9 - Anadarko's Five-Year Total Cumulative Return (Anadarko Petroleum Corp, 2016) \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 35  \n\n1. Macro Inputs  \n\nThe forecast model is mainly determined along with the expected evolution of oil prices, both for \n\nthe explicit period and TV. The assumption used for the TV was based on the expected worldwide \n\naverage of the annual percentage change of GDP (2012-2040) (U.S.EIA, 2016) (Table-3).  \n\nThe different GDP growth scenarios based on the potentially higher or lower oil prices (U.S.EIA, \n\n2016), will be under the assumption of different bull and bear scenarios (Table-4).  \n\n \n\n \n\nOther macro inputs are used but they will be considered in the following section for each company \n\nseparately.  \n\nCommodity Unit 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025\nCrude oil $/bbl 96,2 50,8 37 48 51,4 54,9 58,8 62,9 67,3 72 77,1 82,6\nGrowth - -7,59% -47,19% -27,17% 29,73% 7,08% 6,81% 7,10% 6,97% 7,00% 6,98% 7,08% 7,13%\n\nTable 3- Crude Oil Average Price (World Bank, 2016) \n\nLiquids \nconsumpti\n\non\n\nGross \nDomestic \nProduct \n(GDP)\n\nPrimary \nEnergy \n\nConsumpti\non\n\nLiquids \nconsumpti\n\non\n\nGross \nDomestic \nProduct \n(GDP)\n\nPrimary \nEnergy \n\nConsumpti\non\n\nLiquids \nconsumpti\n\non\n\nGross \nDomestic \nProduct \n(GDP)\n\nPrimary \nEnergy \n\nConsumpti\non\n\nTotal OECD -0,12 2,01 0,66 0,22 1,99 0,63 0,05 2,00 0,64\nTotal Non-OECD 1,83 4,50 2,13 1,83 3,90 1,76 1,83 4,20 1,94\n\nTotal World 0,98 3,52 1,56 1,10 3,11 1,31 1,04 3,31 1,43\n\nBull Scenario (High Oil Prices) Bear Scenario (Low Oil Prices) Base Case Scenario\nAverage annual % change, 2012-40 Average annual % change, 2012-40 Average annual % change, 2012-40\n\nTable 4 - GDP growth scenarios (U.S.EIA, 2016) \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 36  \n\n2. ExxonMobil Standalone Valuation \n2.1. Revenues  \n\n2.1.1.  Upstream  \n\nThe upstream revenues represent on average 9% of the total operating revenues over the last five \n\nyears, but in absolute terms, they have been decreasing significantly, (-15% CARG). The decrease \n\nof upstream revenues has followed the same pattern as oil prices, but in operational terms, it has \n\nhad different performances among liquids and NG (Figure-10). NG production and revenue has \n\ndecreased since 2011. \n\nGoing forward, the company\u2019s production of liquids is expected to increase (4.3M BOE by 2017) \n\nwith ten new projects expected to be completed by 2017. However, the geographic mix and type \n\nof resource are expected to be different - North America is assuming an increasingly powerful \n\nposition. \n\nEven with considerable growth perspectives, the company\u2019s revenues are limited to the growth of \n\noil prices. The driver used to estimate the upstream revenues is aligned with the forecasted growth \n\nfor crude oil prices. However, the new projects that are coming online, an outstanding performance \n\nin terms of operational efficiency and a strong financial flexibility, are enough to establish a growth \n\nof upstream revenues that outpace the commodity price growth. \n\n Following this rationale, after prices hit rock bottom, revenues are expected to increase around \n\n6,67% until 2025 (Figure-11). Due to the delay in recovering oil prices, revenues in 2016 are \n\nexpected to have the same downward pattern as in 2015 (-27%). \n\nFigure 10- ExxonMobil's Revenues and Production Levels (2011-2015) (Company Annual Reports) \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 37  \n\n  \n\n \n\n2.1.2.  Downstream  \n\nDownstream revenues have represented, on average, around 81% of total revenues since 2011, but \n\nhave decreased as ExxonMobil has looked to diminish its footprint in this segment (81,07% in \n\n2011 to 79,89% in 2015).  \n\nThe production forecast is based on the forecasted demand for petroleum and other liquids \n\n(excluding petrochemicals) which is expected to decrease slightly over the next ten years (Annual \n\nEnergy Outlook 2015 (U.S EIA)). \n\nThe correlation between the evolution of unit revenues for downstream products and crude oil \n\nprices is clear. Therefore, the unit revenue will follow the same pattern as crude oil prices, except \n\nin 2016, when downstream revenues are not expected to be in direct correlation with oil prices.  \n\nOverall, ExxonMobil\u2019s average revenue per barrel of refined products is expected to move in close \n\ncorrelation with global crude oil prices. Product sales are expected to decline modestly throughout \n\nthe forecast period (Appendix 14). \n\n2.1.3. Chemical  \n\nChemical revenues represented around 10,8% of the total sales in 2015 (8,9% in 2011). Chemical \n\nrevenues historically have also been closely linked to oil prices and therefore the forecast will \n\nfollow the same driver. In terms of production, chemical product sales remained stable since 2011. \n\nLooking ahead, due to ExxonMobil\u2019s investments and increased capacity, their production is \n\nexpected to increase. The forecast is based on the demand for petrochemical products (between 3% \n\nFigure 11 - Forecast of ExxonMobil's Upstream Revenues \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 38  \n\nand 3,6% until 2025) (U.S.EIA, 2016). Overall, chemical revenues are expected to grow around \n\n6% from 2015 until 2025. \n\n2.2. EBITDA Margin  \n\nThe EBITDA margin analysis highlights the value of ExxonMobil\u2019s integrated business model, \n\nwith EBITDA being less volatile to weak periods of lower oil prices. Over the last four years, the \n\nEBITDA margin on average was 17% (Figure-12). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe upstream EBITDA margin is specially affected by oil prices, but hydrocarbon production costs \n\nand labour costs also play an important role. Since 2012, the EBITDA margin of upstream activities \n\nhas decreased by 7,5% (CARG) (Appendix 15).  \n\nGoing forward, it is expected that the recovery of oil prices will positively affect the EBITDA \n\nmargin, along with growth in liquids production against NG. Conversely, the transition to \n\nunconventional energy sources are factors which will increase the company\u2019s upstream expenses.  \n\nThe other two segments, downstream and chemical, are positively affected by lower crude oil \n\nprices (increased EBITDA YOY of 2,6% and 4,6% in 2015, respectively). Still, there are other \n\nimportant issues that should be considered (Appendix 16).  \n\nLooking ahead, margins in the downstream segment are expected to sustain higher levels in 2016. \n\nThereafter, they should return to the average level of the last four years (2,7%). \n\n0%\n\n20%\n\n40%\n\n60%\n\n80%\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015\n\nEBITDA Margin\n\nUpstream Downstream Chemical Total\n\nFigure 12 - ExxonMobil's EBITDA Margin (2011-2015) \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 39  \n\nIn terms of chemical products, margins have been increasing consistently since 2012 (10% to 17%). \n\nGoing forward, they are expected to reach even higher margins in 2016, but afterwards, they should \n\ndecrease as crude oil price recovers. \n\nOverall, total EBITDA margins should not change significantly over time, as seen over the last \n\nyears.  \n\n2.3. CAPEX, D&amp;A and Working Capital  \n\nExxonMobil announced its plans to cut on CAPEX in reaction to lower oil prices ($23,2Bn in 2016, \n\n$8Bn less).  \n\nHistorically, the upstream segment has accounted, on average, for more than 85% of the total \n\nCAPEX. In absolute terms, net upstream CAPEX has increased significantly as the company \n\nfocuses on new upstream growth projects. In line with what happened in 2015, the next two years \n\nare expected to have smaller absolute levels of CAPEX and going forward, it should increase \n\ngradually, along with oil price recovery (6% CARG 2015-2025). \n\nFollowing the strategy of ExxonMobil to reduce its focus on the downstream sector in favour of \n\nupstream exploration, the downstream CAPEX has fallen since 2009. However, due to its recent \n\ninvestments, ExxonMobil reached more than 25% growth YOY in 2015. Going forward, \n\ndownstream\u2019s CAPEX should average at the same levels as the last four years.  \n\nThe Chemical segment\u2019s CAPEX clearly highlights the large projects that ExxonMobil has been \n\ninvesting in. After a growth of 20% since 2011, these projects are expected to still demand CAPEX \n\nuntil 2017. Going forward, it is expected that chemical\u2019s CAPEX will decline gradually.  \n\nOverall, in the next two years CAPEX is expected to decrease, but afterwards it should grow along \n\nwith oil prices recovery (Table-5). New assets will depreciate at the rate of the existing assets (7% \n\n- average depreciation rate since 2011).  \n\n \n\n2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025\nProperty, plant and equipment n-1 251.605 233.993 216.380 198.768 181.156 163.543 145.931 128.319 110.706 93.094\n(-) Depreciation and depletion expenses 17.612 17.612 17.612 17.612 17.612 17.612 17.612 17.612 17.612 17.612\n(+) Net Property, plant and equipment 233.993 216.380 198.768 181.156 163.543 145.931 128.319 110.706 93.094 75.481\n(+) Annual CAPEX 23.200 23.200 24.843 26.535 28.420 30.402 32.528 34.800 36.569 38.446\n(+) Depreciation new Assets 1.624 3.248 4.987 6.844 8.834 10.962 13.239 15.675 18.235 20.926\n(-) Net New Assets 21.576 41.528 61.384 81.075 100.661 120.101 139.390 158.515 176.849 194.369\nProperty, plant and equipment n 255.569 257.908 260.152 262.230 264.204 266.032 267.709 269.221 269.943 269.851\nTotal annual depreciation 19.236 20.860 22.599 24.457 26.446 28.574 30.851 33.287 35.847 38.538\n\nTable 5 - ExxonMobil's CAPEX and Depreciation \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 40  \n\nThe working capital for the forecast period is the net of free cash and STD (Table-6).

The additional notes and \n\nforecasted FS are detailed in the appendix 17. \n\n \n\n2.4. Valuation \n\n2.4.1. APV \n\nAPV, according to Luehrman (1997), outperforms WACC by separately considering CF from \n\nbusiness operations and financing strategies. Different assumptions were made, especially to \n\ndetermine the discount rate, the TV and the BC.  \n\nFirstly, the CAPM is used to determine the discount rate, consequently, risk-free, MRP and beta \n\nare needed. The risk-free is assumed as the yield on the U.S.\u2019s 10-year TB (Copeland, Koller, &amp; \n\nMurrin, 1991), based on the geometric mean of the last 10 years (2,53%). Since the TB yield in the \n\nU.S. ranged between 4,7% and 1,76% over the last decade, it seems more accurate to use this \n\naverage in order to avoid the volatility of special one-time events. Furthermore, it is important that \n\nthe risk-free has the same duration as the analysed cash-flows, consequently, the U.S.\u2019s 10-year \n\nTB are also more adequate than bonds with a lower maturity. \n\nRegarding MRP, the same approach was used since it was considered the arithmetic average of the \n\nimplied premium verified during the last decade, which results in a premium of 5,32%.  \n\nConsidering the beta of ExxonMobil\u2019s peer group (1,145), and after adjusting this beta to the capital \n\nstructure of ExxonMobil, the unlevered beta used is 0,89. Applying the CAPM, the unlevered cost \n\nof capital is 7,27% (Appendix 18).  \n\nIn order to calculate the tax shield, the CTR applied was 35%, the U.S. federal statutory income \n\ntax rate. Despite an ongoing debate regarding the discount rate used to value the tax shields, the \n\nWorking Capital 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025\nTotal current assets (A), excluding free-cash 30.911 40.196 43.189 46.303 49.797 53.465 57.420 61.667 66.295 71.311\nTotal Current Liabilities, net short-term debt (B) 28.234 36.736 39.491 42.348 45.544 48.891 52.500 56.375 60.598 65.175\nTotal Current Liabilities 44.096 53.783 53.439 52.674 49.281 48.891 52.500 56.375 60.598 65.175\nShort-term debt 15.862 17.047 13.949 10.325 3.737 - - - - -\nWorking capital (A-B) 2.678 3.460 3.698 3.955 4.253 4.574 4.920 5.292 5.697 6.136\nChange in working capital (4.731) 782 238 256 298 321 346 372 405 439\n\nTable 6- ExxonMobil's Working Capital \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 41  \n\nperspective (as supported by most academics) of using cost of debt to discount tax shields, was \n\nused. \n\nThe third step is to evaluate the expected BC.  In theory, this requires the estimation of the \n\nprobability of default and the BC - the more challenging part since they cannot be deducted directly. \n\nTherefore, one way is to estimate a bond rating and use the respective empirical estimates of default \n\nprobability. For a company with the same credit rating as ExxonMobil, the cumulative probability \n\nof default over ten years is 0,03% (Damodaran A. , The Cost of Distress: Survival, Truncation Risk \n\nand Valuation, 2006). Throughout the following formula, it is possible to convert the cumulative \n\nprobability of default on an annual basis: \n\n1?(1??????????)\n?, where ????????? is the annual probability of distress \n\nThus, the annual probability of default is 0,003%. In terms of BC, there are different studies that \n\nhave looked at this issue, but the one considered here was the method proposed by Korteweg \n\n(2007), where the BC are found to be around 2,6% of the firm\u2019s unlevered value (Appendix 19). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe total amount of BC discounted at the risk-free is $12,34M (Table-7). The financial distress \n\nCFs should not be discounted at a discount rate above the risk-free (Almeida &amp; Philippon, 2004) \n\nFinally, for the TV, the growth rate was based on the expected annual average per cent change of \n\nGDP worldwide. After considering the weight of future demand for O&amp;G energy for OECD and \n\nnon-OECD countries, the growth rate used was 3,32%.  \n\nIn conclusion, according to APV, the Entreprise Value of ExxonMobil is $403,98Bn and the Equity \n\nValue is $362,79Bn (Table-8) (Appendix 20). \n\nTable 7 - ExxonMobil's BC \n\nValue Unlevered 400.186\n% of costs 2,60%\nCFD 10.405\nProbability 0,003%\nExpected CFD 31,22%\nDiscount Factor 39,53\nPresent Value 12,34\n\nBankruptcy Costs (million$)\n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 42  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.2. WACC \n\nBesides the steps already developed, the cost of debt is needed to value ExxonMobil through the \n\nWACC. Capital structure and the adjusted cost of equity based on a levered beta is detailed above.   \n\nThe cost of debt was computed through the risk-free plus the default-risk spread according to the \n\ncompany\u2019s probability of default. Thus, following the estimation presented by Korteweg (2007), \n\nthe company\u2019s cost of debt is 3,28%. This was the method that seemed to be the most appropriate \n\nsince the cost of debt calculated through the ratio of interest expenses (excluding non-debt related \n\nexpenses) over net debt, fluctuated significantly. \n\nLastly, the element needed to reach the cost of capital is the company\u2019s capital structure. Over the \n\nlast few years, the company\u2019s debt-to-value ratio has ranged widely between 3% and 10,7%, \n\naveraging 6%. Using the average leverage level of the last four years seems to be the more \n\nreasonable assumption. \n\nConsidering this capital structure, the levered beta used to calculate the cost of equity was also \n\nadjusted through the following formula: \n\n??=[1+(1??) \n?\n\n?\n]?? \n\nFinally, with all assumptions described, the WACC is 7,13% (Appendix 21), the company\u2019s EV is \n\n$413,65Bn and the Equity Value is $372,48Bn (Table-9) (Appendix 22). \n\n \n\n  \n\nTable 8 - ExxonMobil's Valuation with APV \n\nEnterprise Value 403.981\n(-) Net Debt 35.195\n(-) Minority Interest 5.999\nEquity Value 362.787\nCommon Shares 4.196\nPer Share 86,46\n\nAPV (million$)\n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 43  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.3. Relative valuation  \n\nRelative valuation is an important complement to the WACC and APV method, since it brings the \n\nadvantage of including market expectations and confronts them with company specific \n\nassumptions. The peer group selection was determined based on two main drivers: risk levels and \n\nbusiness models (Appendix 23).  \n\n \n\n \n\nExxonMobil has been historically traded at a premium compared to its peers (Table-10). It has the \n\nhighest market capitalization, the lowest leverage level and the highest return on capital.  \n\nIn terms of price to EV-to-EBITDA and Price-to-FCF, ExxonMobil stands out, reflecting the \n\nmarket\u2019s confidence in the company\u2019s future stocks (Appendix 24).  However, its price-to-earnings \n\nratio is below its peers\u2019 average, probably due to the maturity level of ExxonMobil. \n\nThe price-to-market ratio of ExxonMobil is higher than its peers, which could mean overvaluation. \n\nHowever, it does not necessarily mean that the company is overvalued, instead it translates the \n\nmarket premium due to the company\u2019s resilience to deal with peaks of low and high prices.  \n\nNevertheless, as a consequence of different capital structures, the EV ratios are usually the best to \n\naccurately develop a relative valuation.

Sensitivity Analysis   \n\nConsidering the volatility and complexity of the oil industry, developing a sensitivity analysis is \n\nessential. The bull and bear scenario are defined upon two different growth rates applied to the TV: \n\nthe bull scenario applies a growth rate for the TV of 3,5%, contrasting with 3,14% applied to the \n\nbear scenario. These different growth rates reflect the higher or lower potential prices for oil in the \n\nfuture. \n\nFurthermore, in order to reflect these scenarios over the explicit forecast period, the growth rate for \n\ncrude oil prices also changed by plus and minus 2% for the bear and bull scenario, respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFollowing this analysis, the share price of ExxonMobil changes between $73,69 and $102,71 \n\nconsidering the APV model, and $75,44 and $105,77 considering the WACC model (Table-12).  \n\n3,32% 3,50% 3,14%\n\nForecast 86,46 90,06 83,18\n\nForecast + 2% 98,61 102,71 94,88\n\nForecast - 2% 76,62 79,83 73,69\n\nForecast 88,77 92,65 85,25\n\nForecast + 2% 101,36 105,77 97,35\n\nForecast - 2% 78,57 82,03 75,44\n\nEXOONMOBIL\nTerminal Value\n\n%\n O\n\nil \nP\n\nri\nce\n\ns \nG\n\nro\nw\n\nth\n\nA\nP\n\nV\nW\n\nA\nC\n\nC\n\nTable 12 - ExxonMobil's Sensitivity Analysis \n\nTable 11 - ExxonMobil's Relative Valuation \n\nExxonMobil EV/EBITDA EV/EBIT P/E\nPeer Group 341.654 474.894 550.957\n\nIndustry Average 363.732 968.195 722.067\n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 45  \n\n2.6. Valuation Output \n\nComparing the valuation results from the different methods, two main conclusions can be \n\nhighlighted: there is a reasonable consensus within the lowest value provided by each method \n\n($70,22 and $78,5), however the highest value changes significantly, which can be justified by \n\nsome of the limitations of particular methods (Figure-13).  \n\nThe WACC and APV results are similar and are relatively aligned with the market consensus \n\n(Appendix 25), both for the lowest and highest valuations. However, the multiples approach, \n\nespecially the one based on the overall industry, provided unreasonable values for ExxonMobil. \n\n3. Anadarko Standalone Valuation \n3.1. Revenues \n\nThe analysis of sales volume and price evolution of oil, NG and NGL over the last four years \n\nprovide some important inputs to develop the forecast and understand the company\u2019s strategic \n\ndecisions.  \n\nThe following graph highlights the consistent growth of oil and NGL volume sales since 2011 as \n\nopposed to NG. Anadarko derives all of its NG production from the U.S. where the over-supply \n\nhas resulted in depressed domestic NG prices, with liquids becoming far more profitable.  \n\nThe forecast applied to the sales volume followed the same pattern as worldwide oil and NGL \n\nproduction, as well as that of NG consumption. \n\n73,69 75,44 70,72 75,98 78,573,69 75,44 70,72 75,98 78,5\n102,71 105,77 \n\n131,31\n\n220,04\n\n94,64102,71 \n105,77 \n\n131,31\n\n220,04\n\n94,64\n\n -\n\n 50,00\n\n 100,00\n\n 150,00\n\n 200,00\n\n 250,00\n\nAPV WACC Multiples (Peers) Multiples\n(Industry)\n\nMarket\nReferences\n\nP\ner\n\n S\nha\n\nre\n V\n\nal\nue\n\nValuation Method\n\nFigure 13 ExxonMobil's Valuation Output \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 46  \n\nThe oil volume sales had such a significant growth over the last four years (10,1% CARG 2011-\n\n2015) that it is not expected to be as significant for the forecast period (2,7% CARG 2015-2020 \n\nand 1,5 % CARG 2020-2025). The recent decline in oil prices has obligated Anadarko to claw \n\nblack on CAPEX, however, after 2020 it should start to recover with the predicted higher oil prices \n\n(Appendix 26). \n\nThe correlation between NGL and crude oil prices result in these two commodities tending to \n\nfollow the same pattern, both in terms of price and production. NGL production will reach 3% \n\nCARG 2015-2025 (4,9% CARG 2011-2015) \n\nAfter a decrease from 7,2% (2011) to -9,8% (2014), NG production will follow the same decreasing \n\npattern over the forecast period, reaching -3,8% in 2020. Afterwards, it is expected to recover again, \n\nslowly reaching a 1,7% CARG in 2025. The growth rate assumption used to forecast the volumes \n\nof NG production follows the expected growth for the worldwide NG consumption, but after 2020, \n\nit is expected to outpace it by 1% due to predicted recovery prices and the increased pace of \n\ndevelopment of Anadarko\u2019s onshore assets. \n\nFollowing on from this, liquids are expected to represent, on average, 57% of the sales volume-\n\nmix, contrasting with the 46% verified over the historical period. The unit prices closely follow the \n\nestimated prices provided by the U.S. EIA.  \n\n \n3.2. EBITDA Margin \n\nAnadarko\u2019s EBITDA margin reached 57% in 2012,  at its peak of high commodity prices. But \n\nsince 2014, this figure has decreased significantly to negative values. In 2015, the company \n\nEBITDA margin was less than -48%. \n\nIt is expected that Anadarko's EBITDA margin will increase gradually over time with commodity \n\nprices recovering to around 46% by the end of the forecast period (Figure-14).  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n-60%\n\n-40%\n\n-20%\n\n0%\n\n20%\n\n40%\n\n60%\n\n80%\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n2\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n3\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n4\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n5\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n6\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n6\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n7\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n8\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n9\n\n2\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n2\n1\n\n2\n0\n\n2\n2\n\n2\n0\n\n2\n3\n\n2\n0\n\n2\n4\n\nEBITDA Margin\n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 48  \n\nThe depreciation rate used was 6,1% for the existing assets, which is the average depreciation rate \n\nsince 2011. For the new assets, the depreciation rate applied was 7%.  \n\nThe WC for the forecast period is the net of STD, and the other components of current assets and \n\ncurrent liabilities are calculated through the average weight of the last four years in relation to \n\nrevenues (Table-14).The additional notes and forecasted FS are detailed in the appendix 28. \n\n3.4. Valuation \n\n3.4.1. APV \n\nThe steps developed to calculate Anadarko\u2019s valuation throughout APV were the same already \n\nexplained for ExxonMobil. Due to both companies operating in the same industry and being based \n\nin the same country with worldwide operations, most of the assumptions applied followed the same \n\nreasoning. \n\nThe discount rate based on the unlevered beta calculated throughout the CAPM for Anadarko is \n\n7,45%, and the risk-free (2,53%) and MRP (5,32%) used was exactly the same as ExxonMobil \n\n(Appendix 29). However, the unlevered beta was calculated based on Anadarko\u2019s peer group, and \n\nadjusting it to its capital structure. Anadarko\u2019s peer group\u2019s unlevered beta is 1,58 for an average \n\ndebt-to-equity ratio of 1,09, which after adjustments resulted in an unlevered beta of 0,92. \n\nThe CTR used was 35%, the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and the tax shield were \n\ndiscounted using the cost of debt. \n\n2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025\nProperty, plant and equipment net of depreciations n-1 33.751 31.692 29.633 27.575 25.516 23.457 21.398 19.339 17.281 15.222\n\n(-) Depreciation and depletion expenses 2.059 2.059 2.059 2.059 2.059 2.059 2.059 2.059 2.059 2.059\n(+) Net Property, plant and equipment 31.692 29.633 27.575 25.516 23.457 21.398 19.339 17.281 15.222 13.163\n(+) Annual CAPEX 3.044 3.546 3.749 3.950 4.166 4.394 4.638 4.895 5.180 5.052\n(+) Depreciation new Assets 213 461 724 1.000 1.292 1.599 1.924 2.267 2.629 2.983\n(-) Net New Assets 2.831 5.915 8.941 11.891 14.765 17.560 20.274 22.902 25.453 27.757\n\nProperty, plant and equipment n 34.523 35.549 36.515 37.407 38.222 38.958 39.613 40.183 40.674 40.920\nTotal annual depreciation 2.272 2.520 2.783 3.059 3.351 3.658 3.983 4.326 4.688 5.042\n\nTable 13 - Anadarko's CAPEX and Depreciations \n\nWorking Capital 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025\nTotal current assets (A) 2.811 3.494 3.714 3.934 4.145 4.467 4.903 5.406 6.026 6.623\nTotal Current Liabilities, net short-term debt (B) 3.255 3.846 4.154 4.431 4.689 4.755 5.062 5.393 5.802 6.195\nTotal Current Liabilities 6.776 8.514 8.770 8.815 8.081 7.080 5.803 5.393 5.802 6.195\nShort-term debt 3.521 4.668 4.616 4.384 3.392 2.325 741 - - -\nWorking capital (A-B) (445) (352) (440) (498) (543) (288) (159) 13 224 428\nChange in working capital (279) 93 (88) (57) (46) 255 129 171 212 204\n\nTable 14 - Anadarko's Working Capital \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 49  \n\nThe BC were determined throughout the same pattern as ExxonMobil, but considering that \n\nAnadarko has a bond rating of BBB, its cumulative probability of default on an annual basis is \n\n0,435%. Anadarko had a negative EBIT in 2015, thus its negative ICR would mean a spread \n\nequivalent to a D2/D rating. Thus, the applied rating was based on its rating of LTD established by \n\nS&amp;P and Fitch as of December 31, 2015. The BC applied were also based on a percentage \n\nsuggested by Korteweg (2007) (2,6%) (Table-15). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFinally, the assumption under the growth rate applied to the TV was also 3,2%. In conclusion, \n\nusing the APV method, the EV of Anadarko is $40,9Bn and the equity value is $23,5 Bn (Table-\n\n16) (Appendix 30). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.4.2. WACC \n\nThe valuation of Anadarko through the WACC demands for further assumptions. The cost of debt \n\ncombines the risk-free of 2,53% plus the default-risk spread of 2,25%. As explained before, the \n\ndefault-risk spread was determined based on a rating of BBB, which corresponds to 2,25% of the \n\nspread.  Thus, the cost of debt of Anadarko is 4,78%.  \n\nThe capital structure of Anadarko has changed quite significantly over the last year, with its debt-\n\nto-equity ratio changing from around 40% to more than 60%. However, considering the forecast \n\nfor oil prices, it is not expected that Anadarko will be able to go back to the usual debt-to-equity \n\nTable 15 - Anardako's BC \n\nValue Unlevered 36.454,22    \n% of costs 2,6%\nCFD 947,81\nProbability 0,435%\nExpected CFD 4,13\nDiscount Factor 39,53\nPresent Value 163,13\n\nBC\n\nTable 16 - Anadarko's valuation with APV \n\nEnterprise Value 40.941,20    \n(-) Net Debt 14.761,00    \n(-) Minority Interest 2.638,00      \n\nEquity Value 23.542,20    \nCommon Shares 508,00         \nPer Share 46,34           \n\nAPV (million$)\n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 50  \n\nratios in the ST. Although, the assumed target debt-to-asset ratio was 44%, since Damodaran \n\nproposes this for upstream O&amp;G companies. Moreover, by assuming this capital structure, the debt-\n\nto-equity ratio of 79% is in line with the average of the forecasted leverage (78% in BV). \n\nAssuming this capital structure, the levered beta of Anadarko is 1,40, after the respective \n\nadjustment based on its peer group\u2019s beta. Finally, the cost of capital under the WACC is 6,94% \n\n(Appendix 31), the company\u2019s EV is $ 42,59Bn and the equity value is $25,19Bn (Table-17) \n\n(Appendix 32). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.4.3. Relative Valuation \n\nApplying the relative valuation has some particularities that limit the usage of this approach with \n\nAnadarko. Multiples as EV-to-EBITDA and EV-to-EBIT are not material if EBITDA and EBIT \n\nare negative, which is the case of Anadarko as of December 2015.  \n\nDue to the different capital structures of Anadarko\u2019s peer group (Table-18), with debt-to-equity \n\nratio ranging from 0,34 to 3,42, EV ratios are the more accurate. Thus, EV-to-EBITDA and EV-\n\nto-EBIT should be applied.  Nevertheless, since both figures, EBITDA and EBIT, are negative, the \n\nway to apply them is through normalized or forward values. Applying the forward average of \n\nEBITDA for the next five years seems to be an accurate alternative.  \n\nTable 18 - Anadarko's Peer Group \n\nMultiples (million $)\n(million $) EV/EBITDA EV/EBIT P/E (TTM) P/B Market Cap Debt to Equity Ratio ROC\n\nDevon Energy Corp 5 11 - 1 13 2 (60)\nEOG Resources Inc 9 31 - 3 39 1 (22)\n\nApache Corp 3 - - 2 17 3 (98)\nPioneer Natural Resources Co 23 - 24 2 19 0 7\n\nMarathon Oil Corp 9 - - 0 9 0 (8)\nConocoPhillips 12 - - 1 58 1 (4)\n\nAverage 11 57 24 2 29 1 (30)\nAnadarko 14 - - 2 25 1 (22)\n\nSource: Thomson Reuters (Data from 31/12/2015)\n\nTable 17 - Anardako's Valuation with WACC \n\nEnterprise Value 42.589,72    \n(-) Net Debt 14.761,00    \n(-) Minority Interest 2.638,00      \n\nEquity Value 25.190,72    \nCommon Shares 508,00         \nPer Share 49,59           \n\nWACC (million$)\n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 51  \n\nThe relative valuation of Anadarko was based on a peer group composed by seven companies, all \n\nbased in the U.S with only upstream activities.

Rationale for this transaction \n\nAlthough the decrease in oil prices recently suffered presents a challenging period for most \n\ncompanies in the industry, at the same time it is an opportunity for companies with strong BS who \n\ncan use their cash reserves and their lower leverage ratios to engage in deals that benefit them with \n\nundervalued assets and that can reaffirm their competitive position in the future.  \n\nExxonMobil is one of the few companies that can easily benefit from the underpriced targets \n\navailable in the market, due to its strong BS and cash availability. \n\nLooking for the potential targets of ExxonMobil, different companies could be interesting targets \n\nin terms of underpricing. However, a financial driver alone cannot explain the rationale behind a \n\nbuyout, operational synergies are also demanded to justify such a decision during this challenging \n\nperiod.  \n\n24,09 22,81 \n\n6,03\n\n17,63\n\n35,76\n\n24,09 22,81 \n\n6,03\n\n17,63\n\n35,76\n\n74,36 \n83,63 \n\n64,79\n\n17,63\n\n58,78\n\n74,36 \n83,63 \n\n64,79\n\n17,63\n\n58,78\n\n -\n\n 10,00\n\n 20,00\n\n 30,00\n\n 40,00\n\n 50,00\n\n 60,00\n\n 70,00\n\n 80,00\n\n 90,00\n\nAPV WACC Multiples (Peers) Multiples\n(Industry)\n\nMarket Sources\n\nP\ner\n\n S\nha\n\nre\n V\n\nal\nue\n\nValuation Method\n\nValuation Output\n\nFigure 15 - Anadarko's Output Valuation \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 53  \n\nBesides being one of many that has become a lot cheaper, Anadarko emerged as an interesting \n\ntarget due to its high-quality asset base in the Gulf of Mexico and US shale.   \n\nMajor international O&amp;G companies have faced competition from mini-majors such as Anadarko, \n\nwhich have been assuming an important position in North American shale production. ExxonMobil \n\nis one of the majors which has invested more determinedly in order to face this threat, and the XTO \n\nEnergy acquisition in 2009 was part to this strategic move. \n\nAcquiring Anadarko would make ExxonMobil one of the largest onshore U.S. operators which is \n\nin-line with the company\u2019s strategy. Furthermore, significant cost savings can arise from common \n\nareas where both companies are operating. \n\nObviously, when considering a company such as ExxonMobil which already produces 2.3% of the \n\nworld\u2019s oil and is recognized for its safety practices and leadership in delivering projects on time, \n\nthere are few mini-majors that can significantly influence the production and efficiency levels of \n\nExxonMobil. However, in a period of low oil prices, ExxonMobil has the financial conditions to \n\ncapture high-quality assets and low-risk development opportunities through the acquisition of \n\nundervalued companies such as Anadarko.   \n\n2. Valuation of the Merged Entity \n\nFollowing the model proposed by Damodaran (2005), the valuation of the merged entity will be \n\nsplit into three steps: value of combined firm without synergies (1); revalued the combined firm \n\nincluding synergies (2) and calculate the synergies through the difference between the first and \n\nsecond step (3).  \n\nThus, ExxonMobil and Anadarko will be valuated first, based on the same assumption used over \n\nthe standalone valuation, and consequently, the value of the merged entity with no synergies must \n\nbe exactly the same as the sum of the values of each independent firm. Secondly, the valuation of \n\nthe combined firm should include all the synergies that arise from their combination. Lastly, the \n\nvalue of synergies can be isolated by subtracting the valuation with and without synergies.   \n\n2.1 Valuation without synergies \n\nThe valuation with no synergies must guarantee that the combined entity is based on the same \n\nstructural assumption. From the valuation methods used for standalone valuation, only the WACC \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 54  \n\nwill be considered in this section, since APV and WACC resulted in a similar conclusion in the \n\nstandalone analysis. \n\nThe new combined IS and BS stand up from the simple and direct sum of all rubrics existing in \n\neach company\u2019s standalone FS (Appendix 35). Still, some elements should be explained in more \n\ndetail. \n\nStarting with the revenues, it is important to clarify that the combined revenues impacted only the \n\nupstream segment. \n\nThe other important issue which deserves clarification is the discount rate. Regardless of all scale \n\ndifferences, both companies are equally exposed to the same industry challenges and the same \n\ngovernmental regulations, since they both have their headquarters in the U.S.. Accordingly, both \n\nExxonMobil and Anadarko will have the same Risk-free, MRP and CTR. \n\nHowever, the companies\u2019 debt leverage is significantly different, and consequently, the \n\nindependent capital structure and cost of debt are dissimilar. These differences impact the beta and \n\nthe spread used to calculate the discount rate. Following that, the best approach to value the \n\ncombined entities without changing the original assumptions was to consider a weighted average \n\napproach based on each individual EV. Finally, the growth rate applied for the TV was the same \n\nfor both companies and, therefore, the one used for the merged company.  \n\nIn conclusion, considering this approach, the final EV value of the combined firm was $456,04Bn, \n\nwhich differs slightly from the $456,26Bn obtained through the simple sum of both companies\u2019 \n\nEV. A potential explanation for this difference is the impact that different discount rates can have \n\nacross the different assets since this impact is not always in the same proportion. However, since \n\nthis difference is not significant, it will be ignored and the EV value to be used in the last step to \n\ncalculate synergies will be the one based on the sum of both companies. \n\nThis approach ignores the potential fact that existing shareholders still do not want their part in the \n\nnew entity and therefore it is assumed that there is no need for increasing debt and making changes \n\non the capital structure. \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 55  \n\n2.2 Synergies  \n\nAfter developing the first step, it is important to do a careful analysis over why one plus one could \n\nbe bigger than two, i.e. synergies which make this deal valuable.  \n\nDamodaran (2005) grouped synergies into operating and financial. Both will be discussed in this \n\nsection.  \n\n2.2.1 Operating  \n\n2.2.1.1 Revenues \n\nThe literature review already mentioned that revenue synergies are the most difficult to implement. \n\nHowever, if they are normally problematic, for natural resources companies they are even more so. \n\nIn O&amp;G companies, the challenge arises from the fact that they do not have control over market \n\nprices (Appendix 36).  \n\nAnother way to increase revenues could be through increasing production, however for O&amp;G \n\ncompanies, it takes time to have projects up and running (Appendix 37). \n\nIn conclusion, for both sources of revenue synergies, either an increase in unit price or an increase \n\nin production volumes are difficult to achieve, and that is why revenue synergies are not going to \n\nbe considered in this case.  \n\n2.2.1.2 Operating Costs \n\nAs opposed to revenue synergies, costs are the most reliable sources of synergies. Reducing costs \n\nis normally easier because they are more dependent on internal issues. Asides from this, the fact \n\nthat they are fast to implement and have perpetual results, makes them more attractive. \n\nHowever, looking in particular at the O&amp;G industry, it is interesting to realize that the M&amp;A\u2019s role \n\nhas different drivers according to changes in commodity prices. During periods of increasing oil \n\nprices, the dominant driver is growth, whereas in flat or depressed periods, improvements on ROIC \n\nthrough cost reduction and capital efficiency are the most common drivers. \n\nThe latter being the one behind the rationale of this deal, thus cost synergies are crucial to determine \n\nthe value of this acquisition. There are a couple of cost synergies which could be highlighted in \n\nthis deal, especially due to the adjacency of ExxonMobil and Anadarko\u2019s operations in the U.S..  \n\n\n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 57  \n\nLooking at the combined IS, the synergies can arise from cutting costs in O&amp;G operating activities; \n\ntransportation; production and manufacturing; exploration and G&amp;A expenses.  \n\nReducing headcount and G&amp;A function is highly probable when considering a parent company \n\nsuch as ExxonMobil, with hundreds of thousands employees. Probably both companies have \n\nheadquarters in common cities and no longer need two separate buildings. Potential synergies can \n\nalso arise from exploration costs. Being as both use the Successful Effort method of accounting, \n\nthese will simply be considered as other operating costs.  \n\nLastly, the remaining operating costs related with sales-based taxes cost synergies should not be \n\nconsidered, as these are controlled by government and industry-wide regulations. \n\nTherefore, most benefits from this deal are likely to arise during the post-merger integration process \n\nthrough its substantial divestments - which are crucial when looking for opportunities to \n\nsignificantly reduce costs in today\u2019s environment. \n\nHowever, with not enough information to be able to go into detail and create reasonable \n\nassumptions for each cost category, the synergy model was developed based on the following \n\nstatistics: on average, M&amp;A deals in the O&amp;G industry result in 2,4% of combined target sales \n\n(BCG; TUM, 2013) ; 67% of cost synergies are successfully captured (PwC\u2019s Deals M&amp;A, 2014) \n\nand in the former deal between Exxon and Mobil, from the total synergies, Exxon realised two-\n\nthirds of cost savings (Appendix 39) (Christopher, Harris, &amp; Chavan, 2012) \n\nBased on the above sources and considering that Anadarko\u2019s U.S. revenues account for 31% of the \n\ncombined upstream revenues, the cost synergies stemmed in approximately 0,02% of the total \n\ncombined entity\u2019s operating costs. This percentage seems to portray quite a conservative scenario, \n\nbut in fact, it should be remembered that this deal is affecting just one segment of the combined \n\ncompany and it is bringing together two companies from completely different scales.  \n\nFinally, in order to calculate the total cost synergies, CAPEX potential synergies should be \n\nconsidered. Since ExxonMobil and Anadarko are operating in common areas, some overlap in \n\nterms of projected investments is expected. Due to the lack of information in terms of CAPEX \n\nprojections for these regions, the assumptions used were also conservative: 5% reduction for \n\nAnadarko and 10% for ExxonMobil. For ExxonMobil, this percentage was applied to the \n\nproportion of upstream CAPEX in the U.S. (average of 26% since 2011). For Anadarko, it was \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 58  \n\napplied to the total amount of CAPEX since the existing information does not distinguish between \n\nU.S. and non-U.S. CAPEX. \n\n Nonetheless, since CAPEX synergies are assumed to be PP&amp;E, the depreciation expenses were \n\ndeducted proportionally to the reduction in CAPEX (Table-21). \n\nIt should be noted that CAPEX synergies will not have a direct positive impact in the earnings. \n\nHowever, the main objective with a basin- and regional-density deal driven by cost reduction and \n\nimproved ROIC is to optimize the combined portfolio in order to have the most capital-efficient \n\nprojects. Indirectly, reaching a better ROIC means to create higher shareholder returns.   \n\n2.2.2 Financial \n\nIn terms of financial synergies, three different drivers stand out in M&amp;A deals: \n\n? Combining the excess cash and few investment opportunities of one company to one with \n\nhigh-return projects and yet, little available cash to invest;  \n\n? Tax benefits from accumulated net operating losses or higher depreciations  \n\n? Higher debt capacity \n\nExxonMobil is a company with excess cash, however in terms of investment opportunities and \n\nattractiveness there is no significant differences between both companies.  \n\nAs for the second driver, Anadarko\u2019s EBIT was only negative at the 2015 year-end and there is no \n\nsignificant net operating losses accumulated to consider this as a source of financial synergies. In \n\nterms of depreciations, neither ExxonMobil nor Anadarko are expected to be able to increase their \n\ndepreciation.  \n\nLastly, considering standalone figures and looking at the new capital structure, Anadarko will \n\ndefinitely benefit in terms of debt capacity. Consequently, even considering the higher leverage of \n\nAnadarko, due to ExxonMobil\u2019s cash availability and lower debt leverage, the combined firms \n\nshould be considered safer.  \n\nTable 21 - CAPEX Synergies \n\n2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025\nTotal combined CAPEX 26.244 26.746 28.593 30.485 32.586 34.796 37.166 39.695 41.749 43.499\nCAPEX Synergies 802 800 959 1.022 1.093 1.167 1.246 1.331 1.400 1.459\nNET CAPEX Synergies 25.442 25.946 27.634 29.463 31.494 33.629 35.920 38.364 40.349 42.040\nDepreciation Adjustment (56) (112) (179) (251) (327) (409) (496) (589) (687) (789)\n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 59  \n\nIn theory, this safeness should be translated in higher debt capacity and in lower cost of debt. After \n\ncombining both companies without synergies, the new debt-to-equity ratio considering market \n\nvalues is 16%. In contrast, ExxonMobil had a ratio of 10,7% in 2015 and an average of 6% over \n\nthe last five years.  \n\nIncluding synergies, the average debt-to-asset ratio of the explicit forecast period is 7% and \n\ntherefore this was the basis for the target capital structure. Following this capital structure, it is not \n\nexpected that the interest rates used to value ExxonMobil will change. Which means higher savings \n\nin terms of interest expenses which are partly offset as a consequence of the interest-tax shield.  \n\nFinally, the cost of debt was also determined in the standalone valuation, considering the same risk-\n\nfree and the ICR of 9,42 translated in a spread of 0,75%. This last element was based on forecasted \n\nfigures for 2016. The beta used was based on the ExxonMobil\u2019s peer group beta. This peer group \n\nis still the most appropriate for the new merged entity. Then, the new discount rate applied to \n\nWACC is 7,11% (Appendix 40).  \n\n2.3 Integration Costs \n\nFor the synergies analysis, high consideration was given to cost reduction, but these types of \n\nsynergies involve a great effort in terms of integration. Consequently, it is important to take into \n\naccount integration costs and discount them from the total value of synergies.  \n\nHowever, this is a demanding process which involves detailed knowledge about the specific \n\nsynergies and inside information to clearly evaluate them. Thus, a generic assumption will be made.  \n\nSummarizing, the integration costs can be separated into two phases: transaction process and the \n\nsteps needed to exploit synergies. During the first phase, the typical costs are related to law firms, \n\nexisting taxes and consulting assistance. Going forward, in order to proceed with workforce \n\nadjustments, build a new entity, integrate all operational adjustments and internally recreate the \n\nnew entity\u2019s culture and structure, significant investments will be required.  \n\nThe assumption used was based on the survey developed by EY in 2013 which argues that, on \n\naverage, companies spend 14% of the total deal value on integration costs (Ernst and Young, 2014).  \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 60  \n\n2.4 Valuation with Synergies  \n\nThe last step to value the merged entity with synergies is finally possible. Through the WACC \n\nmethod, the merged entity including synergies is $490,22Bn, which means that they account for \n\n$33,96Bn (Appendix 41). Considering integration costs of $ $4,75Bn, the EV is $485,47Bn (Table-\n\n22).   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nComparing the value of the net synergies of integration costs with the value reached for Anadarko, \n\nhighlights the relative magnitude of this amount. The net synergies account for $29,20Bn, more \n\nthan Anadarko\u2019s equity value ($25,19Bn). \n\nFollowing the same assumptions applied before in the sensitivity analysis, the value of the merged \n\nentity ranges between $353,7Bn and $518,87Bn (Table-23). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 22 - Valuation of Merged Entity with Synergies \n\nEV without Synergies (A) 456.262,22  \nEV with Synergies (B) 490.219,54  \nSynergies (B-A) 33.957,32    \nIntegration Costs (14%) 4.754,02      \nNet EV 485.465,52  \n(-) Net Debt 49.956,00    \n(-) Minority Interest 8.637,00      \nEquity Value 426.872,52  \n\nWACC\n\nTable 23 - Sensitivity Analysis of Merged Entity with Synergies \n\n3,32% 3,50% 3,14%\n\nForecast 426.873  446.332  409.215  \n\nForecast + 2% 496.369  518.866  475.952  \n\nForecast - 2% 369.059  385.988  353.698  \n\nTerminal Value\n\n%\n O\n\nil \nP\n\nri\nce\n\ns \nG\n\nro\nw\n\nth\n\nMerged Entity\n(Including Synergies)\n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 61  \n\nThe Acquisition \n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages associated with the different ways of proceeding, however \n\nthe spectrum is not completely free.  \n\nThis deal is obviously only possible in one way: the first acquires the second. However, Anadarko \n\nhas some provisions which could make the negotiation process more challenging. Minimizing the \n\nsize of the control premium and the transaction costs will be part of the strategic objectives of \n\nExxonMobil and, therefore, will be addressed in this analysis.   \n\n1. Mode of Acquisition \n\nThe negotiation process can be carried out as a friendly takeover, which means that settlements are \n\nmade in an informal dialogue that allows for an agreement to be reached early in the process. \n\nHowever, it can also be subject to a hostile acquisition. \n\nThe reasons behind hostile takeovers are many and different theories try to explain them. The \n\nhistory of hostile takeovers shows that they are more common during periods when the stock \n\nmarket is not soaring (DePamphilis, 2010), since shareholders are more willing to accept offers \n\nwhen their shares are overvalued.  \n\nIn fact, considering the current low valuation of the majority of O&amp;G companies due to low \n\ncommodity prices, the perception for shareholders is probably that the shares are undervalued. \n\nTherefore, using a hostile takeover approach would be apparently the right way for ExxonMobil. \n\nHowever, Anadarko has certain provisions on its restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws \n\nwhich limit the suitable approaches available to ExxonMobil.  \n\nAnadarko has some common takeover defences (Appendix 42), but besides that, it is also subject \n\nto Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (D.G.C.L.) (Appendix 43) which imposes \n\nrestrictions on business combination with interested stockholders \u2013 i.e. owning at least 15% of the \n\noutstanding voting stock. Obviously, all these provisions do not make the deal impossible, but will \n\ndemand for a higher premium. \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 62  \n\nTherefore, and since these provisions do not apply if Anadarko's board approves the transaction \n\nbefore ExxonMobil becomes an interested stockholder, ExxonMobil should begin negotiations by \n\napproaching the board in a friendly manner.  \n\nThus, ExxonMobil should initiate an informal dialogue with Anadarko\u2019s top management and try \n\nto reach an agreement on the key issues, namely, long-term business strategy of the new merged \n\nentity, key management positions and short-term operations. Until it has the standstill agreement, \n\nExxonMobil will not make any investment in Anadarko before the corporate board approves this \n\ntransaction.  \n\nThis acquisition is based on the assumption that ExxonMobil views Anadarko as an undervalued \n\ncompany, but the existing anti-takeover provisions will demand for a significant premium. \n\nHowever, due to the implications of the lowest commodity prices in history on the company\u2019s \n\nvaluation, this is the best time to go forward with this acquisition. \n\n2. Distribution of Synergy Benefits \n\nLooking at the degree of relatedness, this deal is clearly a horizontal acquisition, where both \n\ncompanies will essentially benefit from their adjacency. \n\nA great percentage of synergies arise from cost synergies, and neither company has an operating \n\ncompetitive advantage or a special market position over the other. However, a proportional division \n\nof synergies based on EV would not be reasonable since ExxonMobil has an EV almost 10 times \n\nbigger than Anadarko. The rationale behind this deal is a result of ExxonMobil\u2019s strategy to \n\nincrease its share in the upstream segment in North America, and consequently, using the \n\npercentage of upstream sales seems a more reasonable approach to split synergies. Thus, \n\nExxonMobil and Anadarko will receive 69% and 31% of the total amount of synergies, respectively \n\n(Figure-17). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 63  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3. Premium Offered  \n\nAnadarko\u2019s standalone valuation suggests an equity value of $27,83Bn, 13% upside potential \n\ncompared with $24,69Bn - its average market capitalization during 2015. Consequently, the new \n\nequity value with synergies is $36,81Bn, 32% upside potential compared to the standalone \n\nvaluation. Thus, the value of synergies, along with Anadarko\u2019s undervaluation, results in a \n\npremium of 49% (Table-24). \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Method of Payment  \n\nThe existing fundamentals to choose between cash or stock tends to support deals financed with \n\ncash rather than stock. The lack of confidence assumed with stock offers, due to the opportunity to \n\nshare risk, is one of the reasons that justify the worst market reactions. In this case, since synergies \n\nwere calculated under a conservative scenario (67% probability of realization), there is no reason \n\nto use stocks to share the risk with Anadarko\u2019s stockholders.  \n\nThis argument further supports the initial position of proceeding with a deal based on a cash \n\npayment. However, the company\u2019s ability to effectively pay with cash without harming its capital \n\nFigure 17 - Synergies Distribution \n\nAbsolute % Total EV % US Upstream Sales (2016) Synergies (Probab 67%)\nEV ExxonMobil 413.673 91% 69% 20.219\nEV Anadarko 42.590 9% 31% 8.985\n\nTable 24 - Premium Offered \n\nAnnual Market Cap 24.693         Real Downside Potential 13%\nEquity Value Standalone Valuation 27.829         Real Preimum Offered 32%\nEquity Including Synergies 36.813         Total Premium Offered 49%\n\nAnadarko\n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 64  \n\nstructure or negatively impacting its current capital structure is an important factor that must be \n\nconsidered.  \n\nAs suggested by Damodaran (2006), the ICR can be used as a proxy to estimate the maximum \n\namount of debt that the company can take and still have the same investment grade. Since this deal \n\ninvolves the acquisition of a company which is 10 times smaller than the acquirer, it would be \n\nunreasonable to assume that Anadarko would be able to really affect ExxonMobil\u2019s credit rating. \n\nIn fact, the merged entity\u2019s synergies has an ICR in line with a rating of Aaa/AAA.  \n\nThe merged entity without synergies has an ICR of 9,01 (Table-25) and in order to maintain a \n\nminimum of 8,5 ICR, it can have a maximum amount of debt of $97,48Bn, which means being \n\nable to issue another $47,46Bn. This new amount of debt already represents 129% of the total price \n\noffered for this acquisition ($36,81Bn). \n\n \n\nHowever, considering that ExxonMobil also has $ 3,56Bn available in cash and unused committed \n\nST and LT lines of credit with a total amount of $6,4Bn, it has in total $57,42Bn available, which \n\nis more than the total price offered. Thus, it is possible to assume that ExxonMobil can acquire \n\nAnadarko with cash and still maintain its financial flexibility (Table-26). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 25- ICR of Merged Entity \n2016E ExxonMobil Anadarko Merged (no syn) Aaa/AAA Requirement After Extra Leverage\n\nCash 3.557 749 4.306 4.306\nDebt 33.312 16.703 50.015 97.477\nEBITDA 34.098 2.479 36.577 36.577\nInterest Cost 683 914 1.597 1.692\nEBIT 14.178 207 14.386 14.386\nInterest coverage 21 0 9 > 8.5 9\n\nTable 26 - Debt Capacity of the Merged Entity \n\nTotal Debt (2016) 97.477         \nTotal Debt (2015) 50.015         \nNew Debt Issues 47.462         \nCash 3.557           \nUnused ST and LT Credit 6.400           \nTotal Available 57.419         \nPrice offered 36.813         \n% Cash Available/Price offered 1,56             \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 65  \n\n5. The Takeover Bid \n\nOverall, an offer with a 49% premium and the ability to proceed with a cash offer, are reasons to \n\nbelieve that ExxonMobil\u2019s offer will be perceived as friendly, which is truly important due to the \n\nAnadarko's takeover restrictions, in particular the D.G.C.L.. Still, having a detailed DD that is able \n\nto clarify the value added with this deal is crucial for the friendly takeover to be successful.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 66  \n\nConclusion  \n\nAll companies in the O&amp;G industry experienced a drop in valuation due to the current prices. This \n\nhas resulted in increasing financial pressure and significant market uncertainty. Despite being a \n\nchallenging period for most companies in the industry, it is also an opportune time to invest in \n\nundervalued assets. \n\nThe rationale of this proposed deal emerged as a consequence of ExxonMobil\u2019s strong BS, together \n\nwith its desire to build on its upstream activity in North America and pursue its goal of remaining \n\nat the forefront of the industry worldwide. Through cash reserves and lower leverage ratios, \n\nExxonMobil can look for a target with valuable resources such as Anadarko. \n\nAnadarko is deemed an attractive target due to its valuable resources in North America, but \n\nspecially due to the potential for cutting overhead costs and optimizing on overlapping operations. \n\nBeing operationally efficient and able to cut costs without losing competitiveness is the desired \n\nscenario of every company in the industry at the moment. \n\nThus, due to the strategic reasons behind this deal, costs account for the majority of the estimated \n\nsynergies. The uncontrolled market prices of a standalone company explain why revenue synergies \n\nwere not considered in this case. Besides cost synergies, financial synergies were also accounted \n\nto a lesser extent. In total, net synergies accounted for $29,2Bn, which represent 69% of \n\nAnadarko\u2019s EV.  \n\nConcerning the acquisition, ExxonMobil should acquire Anadarko through a friendly approach \n\nsupported by a cash offer with a premium of 49%. \n\n  \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 67  \n\nAppendixes \nAppendix 1: How to justify the collapse of oil and gas prices? \n\nDuring 2015, supply continued to feed the storage levels, especially in Saudi Arabia, with OPEC \n\ngiving priority to protect their market share. Furthermore, the cut of U.S.\u2019s production levels has \n\nbeen lower than what was predicted by industry analysts. In addition, there is uncertainty regarding \n\nthe potential increase in production that is expected to arise from Iran, a country which was freed \n\nfrom nuclear sanctions and wants to recover market share. \n\nDespite the efforts to decrease total U.S. production since the middle of 2015 and the agreement \n\nestablished between some OPEC members and Russia in mid-February to freeze production to the \n\nlevels of January 2016, there is still doubt about the effectiveness of such measures regarding the \n\noil price.  \n\nUpstream companies started to react to this low price environment in 2015 with cash conservation \n\nmeasures, plans for cost reductions through manpower layoffs, renegotiation or cancellation of \n\nsupply contracts and postponement of capital projects. \n\nAppendix 2: Global demand and supply of oil and gas \n\nTechnical innovations have been assuming a critical influence concerning cost reduction and access \n\nto new exploration areas which was impossible to explore in the past. This fact along with \n\nimprovements in energy efficiency and changes in major economies of developing countries \n\nexplain the world peak of oil supply.  \n\nConcerning oil, OPEC and U.S. are the leaders with production levels of more than 1 million and \n\n0.8 million barrels per day, respectively (OECD; IEA, 2016). \n\nIn relation to gas, the rising of renewables along with very cheap coal have shown sluggish growth \n\nin the gas demand in the OECD countries, particularly in Japan where demand is expected to fall. \n\nThe price-demand sensitivity of non-OECD Asian countries is an uncertainty (IEA, 2015) and in \n\nthe medium-long term, it is questionable if gas will be competitive enough to be more than a \n\nshortage option. The environmental restriction will be indisputably a strong incentive, but not \n\nenough to have a radical impact on demand.  \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 68  \n\nAccording to International Energy Agency (2015), the global LNG export capacity will represent \n\nmore than 40% of the current capacity. However, due to the capital intensive investment associated \n\nwith LNG and considering the current low prices, it is expected that part of the new LNG plants \n\nwill struggle to be effectively concretized.  \n\nAppendix 3: Oil Prices \n\nThe World Bank (2016) is changing its forecast for lower oil prices, both for short and long-term \n\nperspective. In the short-term perspective the forecasted average price is $37/bbl in 2016, \n\ncontrasting with $51/bbd expected in January of 2015 and in the long-term, the forecast changed \n\nfrom $100/bbd to $82,6/bbd. \n\nAppendix 4: Unconventional energy sources \n\nTechnology-driven supplies explain the difference between the 1 trillion barrels of recoverable \n\ncrude and condensate resources estimated to exist in 1981 by U.S. geological survey and the 4,5 \n\ntrillion barrels currently estimated. These energy sources along with renewal energy are expected \n\nto be enough to face the global demand growth beyond 21 century (IEA, 2015).  \n\nFollowing The Outlook for Energy (ExxonMobil, 2016)all energy sources will grow until 2040 \n\nwith massive increase in cleaner fuels, in particular, natural gas which will grow 70% comparing \n\nwith levels of 2014. From the natural gas growth, one-third is due to unconventional gas and arises \n\nmostly from North America (60%).   \n\nStill, this new era of unconventional energy sources and renewable energy is full of uncertainties \n\nand the consequences for oil and gas companies are not entirely understood. However, lower prices \n\nare already demanding for efficient structures able to reduce cost production and increase unit \n\nmargins. \n\nInvesting strongly in technology is critical not just to be able to reach unconventional sources of \n\nenergy but also to deal with these price forces.  \n\nAppendix 5: Legal, Regulatory and Financial Environment \n\nThe end of the U.S. crude export ban: Established in December 2015 as a consequence of the \n\nexisting price parity between West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent Crude, which eliminate \n\nopportunities for price arbitrage. On a more local perspective, this regulatory change is expected \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 69  \n\nto increase light sweet oil demand from Europe and Asia and for the overall oil market. Having \n\nU.S. as an exporter means that WTI will be a truly International benchmark adding more efficiency \n\nto the global trading market. \n\nMore restricted financing policies: Senior secured debt, bonds and junior subordinated debt were \n\nthe sources used to fund the push of domestic production in U.S. However, due the collapse of \n\nprices in more than 65%, some oil and gas companies are experiencing unsustainable levels of \n\ndebt. Along with this financial pressure, the lenders of these companies are experiencing double \n\npressure from the Office of the Controller of the Currency and FDIC to develop more demanding \n\nstress tests. Consequently, a significant reduction of financing options will be available (Heroux, \n\n2016).  \n\nEnvironmental taxes: Regulatory policies have also increased pressure on the oil and gas industry \n\nworldwide, but the U.S. has been particularly held down with higher environmental taxes in 2016 \n\nand additional bans and restrictions implemented by local voters. For example, banning the use of \n\nhydraulic fracturing, initiatives include increasing mandatory operations setbacks and empowering \n\nlocal governments to regulate oil and gas operations. \n\nCompliance Rules: Compliance rules have being implemented with the final goal of obligating \n\noil and gas companies to detail more and more their emissions during their operations. The \n\nchallenge for these companies will be to show that their production is respecting the low-carbon \n\nenvironment. \n\nAppendix 6: ExxonMobil\u2019s Upstream Segment  \n\nLooking at recent data published in the Financial &amp; Operational Review of ExxonMobil \n\n(ExxonMobil, 2016), in terms of upstream is important to highlight six major projects completed \n\nin 2015, specifically the two capital-efficient deepwater projects in offshore West Africa which \n\nstarted ahead of schedule and below budget. \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 70  \n\nFrom the 91 billion oil-equivalent barrels, 73% are proved reserves with installed production \n\nfacilities. The components of ExxonMobil\u2019s resources base is made up of around 60% liquids and \n\nin terms of development type, 73% comprised conventional oil and gas, unconventional oil and \n\ngas, and heavy oil/oil sands resources. \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 7: ExxonMobil\u2019s Downstream Segment  \n\nFrom crude oil conversion into fuels for transportation, lubricants and chemical plant feedstocks \n\nfor plastics and many other consumer and industrial products, ExxonMobil reaches a worldwide \n\nmarket through 8.000 miles of active pipelines globally, 24 lubricant plants and about 225 fuel \n\nterminals around the world. \n\nIn North America, ExxonMobil has nine refineries distributed through the United States and \n\nCanada and has the capacity to process about 2,3 million barrels of crude oil per day which is \n\nequivalent to 45% of its global refining capacity. Europe represents 30% and Asia represents 20% \n\nof ExxonMobil\u2019s global refining capacity.  \n\nBases basestock, the major component of lubricating oils, and finished lubricants represent part of \n\nthe committed investment that has been made and in 2015 was completed one lubricant plant \n\nexpansions in Texas, China and Finland to serve strong lubricant demand growth in many focus \n\nmarkets.  \n\nAppendix 8: Anadarko\u2019s upstream activity in the United States \n\nThe Rocky Mountains Region Anadarko is expected to be a focus area for Anadarko in 2016. \n\nDuring 2015, Anadarko was focused on production and adding reserves through horizontal drilling \n\nand infill drilling, resulting in an increase in liquids sales volumes of 11% in relation to 2014. The \n\nSouthern and Appalachia Region is where Anadarko has been focused on finding and developing \n\nOperating Highlights (ExxonMobil, 2016) \n\nLiquids production (net, thousands of barrels per day) 2.345\nNatural gas production available for sale (net, millions of cubic feet per day) 10.515\nOil-equivalent production (net, thousands of oil-equivalent barrels per day) 4.097\n\nRefinery throughput (thousands of barrels per day) 4.432\nPetroleum product sales (thousands of barrels per day) 5.754\nChemical prime product sales (thousands of tonners) 24.713\n\nOperating Highlights\n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 71  \n\nnatural gas and liquids from shales, tight sands and fractured-reservoir plays. In 2016, it expects to \n\nproceed with its horizontal drilling program with a special focus on the Delaware basin. In the Gulf \n\nof Mexico has 60% of working interest in 279 blocks, operates in eight active floating platforms \n\nand holds interest in 34 fields. In Alaska its main activity is concentrated on the North Slope and \n\nin the last quarter of 2015 it has four out of seven producing wells coming online from the Alpine \n\nWest infrastructure. \n\nAppendix 9: Anadarko\u2019s upstream activity internationally  \n\nAnadarko possessed 40 gathering systems and 54 processing and treating plants. \n\nIn Algeria the product is sold by tankers Saharan Blend and in Ghana through Jubilee Oil, both \n\nhigh-quality crude that supplies refiners with significant quantities of premium gasoline, diesel and \n\njet fuel, within others. Colombia, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Mozambique, New Zealand and Kenya are the \n\nother countries where Anadarko has operations. In 2016 Anadarko will have a particular focus in \n\nits explorations in Colombia and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. \n\nThe international proved reserves are composed of a mix of 35% oil and condensate, 48% of natural \n\ngas and 17% of NGLs. \n\nAppendix 10: Anadarko\u2019s midstream activities \n\nThese plants are based mainly on its onshore producing facilities located in Wyoming, Colorado, \n\nUtah, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Texas. In 2015, liquids-rich resources \n\nwere the main focus of Anadarko in terms of growth, including Wattenberg, the Delaware basin, \n\nthe Eagleford shale and the Marcellus shale dry-gas play. In 2016, the company is planning to focus \n\non the Delaware basin.   \n\nAppendix 11: Western Gas Partners, LP (WES)  \n\nIn the limited partnership, Western Gas Equity Partners, LP (WGP), a publicly traded consolidated \n\nsubsidiary, owns interest in WES and at the end of 2015 Anadarko\u2019s ownership interest in WGP \n\nwas 87,3% as limited partner interest and the entire non-economic general partner interest. WGP\u2019s \n\nownership interest in WES was 34,6% limited partner interest, the entire 1,8% general partner \n\ninterest and all of the WES incentive distribution rights. Through other subsidiaries, Anadarko also \n\nhas 8,5% limited partner interest in WES. \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 72  \n\nAppendix 12: Anadarko\u2019s marketing activities \n\nMinimizing market-related shut-ins, maximizing prices and managing credit-risk exposure are the \n\nmain goals of the marketing segment. Anadarko\u2019s worldwide oil, condensate, natural-gas and \n\nNGLs product sales are normally marketed at the currently market prices at the time of the sale. \n\nAs the midstream segment, Anadarko also sells products from third parties, especially the ones \n\nwhich come from neighbour producers. Throughout this strategy, Anadarko can aggregate volumes \n\nthat together guarantee the maximization of its transportation, storage and fractionation capacity. \n\nTherefore, Anadarko is able to reach more competitive prices and a more efficient performance.   \n\nThe products are marketed at fixed-price and cost escalation-based agreements within a variety of \n\ncontract structures. However, to hedge its risk exposure to changes in market prices, Anadarko \n\nengages in limited trading activities, since it normally has a net short position as an oil\u2019s seller, \n\nnatural gas and NGLs agreements which is offset by the Company\u2019s natural long position as a \n\nproducer.  \n\nAppendix 13: Anadarko\u2019s Net Loss \n\nFrom this net loss, $5,1 billion are related to impairments primarily due some U.S. onshore and \n\nGulf of Mexico properties, but also impairments of exploration assets, as some unproved \n\nproperties, write-off of suspended exploratory well costs in Brazil and losses on divestitures.  \n\nAppendix 14: ExxonMobil\u2019s Downstream Revenues  \n\nThe rational under the forecast demand for refined products is based on the long-term outlook of \n\nintense competition in terms of supply, where new capacity is expected to outpace the growth of \n\nglobal demand.   \n\nFurthermore, the proposed carbon policy, specific climate-related regulations worldwide and the \n\ngrowth of biofuels supply are potential factors to impact the downstream segment negatively. In \n\nterms of unit revenue, even with a scenario of lower crude prices, the future profitability will be \n\nsmall due the worldwide supply and demand imbalance. \n\nAppendix 15: ExxonMobil\u2019s Upstream EBITDA \n\nThe decrease in EBITDA margins in the upstream segment was in part a consequence of lower oil \n\nprices but also a reflection of its shift to unconventional energy sources. Unconventional energy \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 73  \n\nsource explorations are typically more costly, both for exploration and refinery treatment. \n\nFurthermore, the production mix of liquids and natural gas also affect the expenses regarding the \n\nupstream segment since normally liquids are more profitable to produce than natural gas.  \n\nAppendix 16: ExxonMobil\u2019s downstream EBITDA  \n\nDownstream EBITDA margins did not have the same trajectory over the last few years, ranging \n\nbetween 1,5% and 4%. The main reasons to explain the lowest EBITDA margins in 2013 and 2014 \n\nare the industry overcapacity and lower WTI and Brent crude oil spreads. \n\nSpreads in benchmarked oil prices are not likely to significantly affect downstream EBITDA \n\nmargins hereafter, especially since the U.S. crude oil export ban was lifted which is expected to \n\nnarrow the spread between North Sea Brent and U.S. WTI. However, refining margins should still \n\nfeel the pressure of new capacity additions which will probably be enough to beat growth in global \n\ndemand. Furthermore, the potential increase of heavy crude oil supply from the upstream segment \n\nalso could impact refinery margins since it requires more advanced techniques and has negative \n\nenvironmental impacts.  \n\nAppendix 17: ExxonMobil\u2019s Forecasted FS and Notes \n\n \n\nIncome Statement (million $) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025\nSales and other operating revenue(1) 467.029 453.123 420.836 394.105 259.488 210.328 273.668 294.188 315.478 339.286 364.219 391.104 419.970 451.431 485.526\n   Upstream 46.442 40.326 39.061 37.162 24.053 17.519 22.727 24.564 26.483 28.629 30.911 33.383 36.048 38.962 42.131\n   Downstream 378.623 374.047 342.706 318.747 207.293 171.564 222.379 237.927 253.911 271.716 290.412 310.460 331.856 355.057 380.058\n   Chemical 41.942 38.726 39.048 38.178 28.134 21.236 28.550 31.683 35.070 38.926 42.879 47.244 52.047 57.392 63.316\n   Corporate and Financing 22 24 21 18 8 10 12 13 14 15 16 18 19 20 22\nIncome from equity affiliates 15.289 15.010 13.927 13.323 7.644 7.644 7.644 7.644 7.644 7.644 7.644 7.644 7.644 7.644 7.644\nOther income 4.111 14.162 3.492 4.511 1.750 - - - - - - - - - -\nTotal revenues and other income 486.429 480.681 438.255 411.939 268.882 217.972 281.312 301.832 323.122 346.930 371.863 398.748 427.614 459.075 493.170\nCrude oil and product purchases 266.534 263.535 244.156 225.972 130.003 118.072 153.629 165.148 177.099 190.464 204.461 219.554 235.758 253.419 272.559\nProduction and manufacturing expenses 40.268 38.521 40.525 40.859 35.587 28.845 37.532 29.910 32.075 34.495 37.030 39.763 42.698 45.897 49.363\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 14.983 13.877 12.877 12.598 11.501 7.134 9.282 9.978 10.701 11.508 12.354 13.266 14.245 15.312 16.468\nDepreciation and depletion 15.583 15.888 17.182 17.297 18.048 19.236 20.860 22.599 24.457 26.446 28.574 30.851 33.287 35.847 38.538\nExploration expenses, including dry holes 2.081 1.840 1.976 1.669 1.523 1.234 1.606 1.372 1.471 1.582 1.698 1.824 1.958 2.105 2.264\nInterest expense 247 327 9 286 311 683 610 508 401 355 329 329 329 329 329\nSales-based taxes(1) 33.503 32.409 30.589 29.342 22.678 1.324 20.678 22.228 23.837 25.636 27.520 29.551 31.732 34.110 36.686\nOther taxes and duties 39.973 35.558 33.230 32.286 27.265 27.265 23.537 25.301 27.132 29.180 31.324 33.636 36.119 38.825 41.757\nTotal costs and other deductions 413.172 401.955 380.544 360.309 246.916 203.793 267.735 277.045 297.173 319.667 343.291 368.775 396.127 425.844 457.965\nGrowth (0) (0) (0) (0) (0) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nIncome before income taxes 73.257 78.726 57.711 51.630 21.966 14.178 13.578 24.787 25.949 27.263 28.572 29.973 31.487 33.231 35.205\nIncome taxes 31.051 31.045 24.263 18.015 5.415 4.962 4.752 8.675 9.082 9.542 10.000 10.491 11.020 11.631 12.322\nNet income including noncontrolling interests 42.206 47.681 33.448 33.615 16.551 9.216 8.825 16.111 16.867 17.721 18.572 19.483 20.466 21.600 22.883\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests 1.146 2.801 868 1.095 401 223 214 390 409 429 450 472 496 523 554\nNet income attributable to ExxonMobil 41.060 44.880 32.580 32.520 16.150 8.993 8.612 15.721 16.458 17.291 18.122 19.011 19.970 21.077 22.329\n\nDividends 9.020 10.092 10.875 11.568 12.090 4.608 4.413 8.056 8.433 8.860 9.286 9.741 10.233 10.800 11.442\nEarnings Reinvested 32.040 34.788 21.705 20.952 4.060 4.608 4.413 8.056 8.433 8.860 9.286 9.741 10.233 10.800 11.442\nEarnings attributable to ExxonMobil 4.496 4.306 7.861 8.229 8.646 9.061 9.505 9.985 10.539 11.164\nEarnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 112 107 195 204 215 225 236 248 262 277\nPayout Ratio 21% 21% 33% 34% 73% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50%\n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 74  \n\n \n\n \n\nNotes: Concerning leverage, ExxonMobil had a historical debt to equity ratio (BV) of 11,3% \n\n(2007-2015). However, it has increased over the last years. In 2015, ExxonMobil had a debt to \n\nequity ratio of 22% after issued $8 billion of long-term debt in the first quarter of 2015. Going \n\nforward, the long-term debt obligations until 2020 are $9.902M and $10.023M in 2021 and beyond. \n\nDue this schedule, the $9.902M amount was equally split between 2017 and 2020 and after 2021 \n\nExxonMobil is assumed to have the same long-term debt amount of $10.023M.

From this selection, only non-state-owned companies were \n\nconsidered. Furthermore, since Exxon Mobil is part of Big Oil, the peer group was easily defined \n\nbased on the supermajors which are also part of this group. Still, there are differences among the \n\nsupermajors that should be taken into account over the relative valuation. \n\nAppendix 24: Price to Free Cash-Flow \n\nDue the particularities of the oil industry and significant amounts of debt applied to future \n\nproduction, having future cash flows is crucial to maintain financial flexibility. Even with a \n\nconsistent net income, focusing on cash flow metrics is important for this industry.

In these areas, the time between discovery and production tends to be higher \n\nand the decommissioning activities are more costly than in shallower waters. \n\nDate: July 2016 \n\nYahoo Finance Stock Analysis on Net YCHARTS 4Traders\nEnterprise Value 431.980 434.702 438.290 370.567\n\n(-) Net Debt 35.195 35.195 35.195 35.195\n(-) Minority Interest 5.999 5.999 5.999 5.999\n\nEquity Value 390.786 393.508 397.096 329.373\nCommon Shares 4.196 4.196 4.196 4.196\nPer Share 93,13 93,78 94,64 78,50\n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 79  \n\nAppendix 28: Anadarko\u2019s Forecasted FS and Notes \n\n \n\nNOTES: \n\nThe absolute value for LT Debt of Anadarko has been stable ranging between 13k and 15k.

Following that, Anadarko is expected to pay back $5.749M \n\nuntil 2020 which means to have a LTD of $10.725M in 2020. This amount was assumed to be \n\nstable over the forecast period. \n\nThe short-term debt was determined according to the obligations which will be faced in each \n\nspecific year added to other short-term needs. Following this reasoning, the debt to equity ratio is \n\nexpected to recovery from 111% in 2016 to 38% in 2025, with an average of 72% over the explicit \n\nforecast period. The higher level of short-term debt is needed to face more challenging periods over \n\nthe next years of lower commodity prices.  \n\nThe interest rates used to calculate the amount corresponding to debt related interest expenses were \n\nthe existing rate associated with commercial paper for short-term debt and the weighted average \n\ninterest rate calculated from the current obligations for the long-term debt. Thus, the short-term \n\ninterest rate is 0,98% and the long-term interest rate is 5,26%.   \n\nIn the working capital calculations, the current asset retirement obligations, interest payable, other \n\ntaxes payable and accrued expenses are the current liability rubrics which were considered to be \n\nstable over the forecast period, since they are not correlated with sales and there is no further \n\ninformation to predict future variations.  \n\nAppendix 29: Anadarko\u2019s unleveraged cost of capital \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRisk Free Rate 2,53%\nBeta a 0,92\nMarket Risk Premium 5,32%\nKa (unleverage) 7,45%\n\nUNLEVERAGED COST OF CAPITAL\n\nPeer Group BL Debt/Equity\nDevon Energy Corp 2,0 1,9\nEOG Resources Inc 1,4 0,5\nApache Corp 1,7 3,4\nPioneer Natural Resources Co 1,4 0,4\nMarathon Oil Corp 2,2 0,4\nConocoPhillips 1,1 0,6\nOccidental Petroleum Corp 1,4 0,3\nSource: Thomson Reuters (06/06) 1,6 1,1\n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 81  \n\nAppendix 30: Anadarko\u2019s valuation with APV  \n\n \n\nAppendix 31: Anadarko\u2019s WACC Calculation \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 32: Anadarko\u2019s Valuation with WACC \n\n \n\nAppendix 33: Anadarko\u2019s Relative valuation  \n\nHaving only upstream activities results in being exposed to a similar risk in terms of commodity \n\nprices and having a significant part of their activities susceptible to the same exploration challenges \n\n(mainly in U.S.). \n\nAPV (million $) 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025\nEBIT 207 1.969 2.298 2.484 2.629 2.855 3.109 3.391 3.800 4.189\n(+) Depreciation 2.272 2.520 2.783 3.059 3.351 3.658 3.983 4.326 4.688 5.042\n(-) Tax on EBIT (73) (689) (804) (870) (920) (999) (1.088) (1.187) (1.330) (1.466)\n(-) ? working capital 279 (93) 88 57 46 (255) (129) (171) (212) (204)\n(-) Capex (3.044) (3.546) (3.749) (3.950) (4.166) (4.394) (4.638) (4.895) (5.180) (5.052)\nFree Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) (358) 161 615 781 939 865 1.237 1.463 1.767 2.508\nDiscounted Cash Flow (333) 139 496 586 655 562 748 824 926 1.223\nResidual Value 30.628\nEnterprise Value Unlevered 36.454\nInterest Expense 914 919 885 838 777 710 611 565 565 565\nInterest Tax Shield 320 322 310 293 272 248 214 198 198 198\nTerminal Value of Interest Tax Shield 2.592\nPresent Value of Tax Shield 305 293 269 243 215 188 154 136 130 124\nCumulative PV of Tax Shield 4.650\nCumulative PV of Bankrupcy Costs 163\nAdjusted Present Value 40.941\n\nWACC (million$) 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025\nEBIT 207 1.969 2.298 2.484 2.629 2.855 3.109 3.391 3.800 4.189\n(+) Depreciation 2.272 2.520 2.783 3.059 3.351 3.658 3.983 4.326 4.688 5.042\n(-) Tax on EBIT (73) (689) (804) (870) (920) (999) (1.088) (1.187) (1.330) (1.466)\n\n(-) ? working capital 279 (93) 88 57 46 (255) (129) (171) (212) (204)\n(-) Capex (3.044) (3.546) (3.749) (3.950) (4.166) (4.394) (4.638) (4.895) (5.180) (5.052)\nFree Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)(358) 161 615 781 939 865 1.237 1.463 1.767 2.508\nDiscounted Cash Flow (335) 141 503 597 671 578 773 855 966 1.282\nResidual Value 36.559\nEnterprise Value 42.590\n\nCost of Equity 9,96%\nCost of Debt 4,78%\nCorporate Tax Rate 35,00%\nE/V 56,00%\nD/V 44,00%\nD/E 78,57%\nWACC 6,94%\n\nWACC Calculations\n\nInterest Coverage Ratio -0,09\nRating BBB\nSpread 2,25%\nRisk Free Rate 2,53%\nKd 4,78%\n\nCost of Debt\n\nRisk Free Rate 2,53%\nMarket Risk Premium 5,32%\nBeta Leverage 1,40\nKa (leverage) 10,0%\n\nCost of Equity\n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 82  \n\nAppendix 34: Market Consensus of Anadarko\u2019s Valuation \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 35: Merged Entity without Synergies \n\n \n\n \n\nBalance Sheet (million $) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2.021       2022 2023 2024 2025\nAssets\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents 15.361     12.053     8.342       11.985     4.644       4.306       5.453       5.725       6.024       6.385       10.237     18.519     27.506     37.895     49.744     \nCash and cash equivalents -

Consequently, if in some industries a merger can be a \n\nsource of lower customer bargaining power, this is not an option in this case. For a company as \n\nAnadarko or even ExxonMobil which is part of the big oil, they together still very small in the \n\nglobal scheme to impact on the price determination. In fact, the Middle East companies, which \n\nhave a bit more power, wouldn\u2019t be able to have control over the commodity price.  \n\nThe only way which could be a source of synergies from the revenue side would be a potential \n\nadjustment on the hedging strategy of both companies. But in fact, there is not enough information \n\nto measure potential synergies that could arise from canceling any derivatives instruments used by \n\nboth companies or by change hedging positions.  \n\nAppendix 37: Increase production in oil and gas industry \n\nNormally projects have a development cycle between 5 and 10 years thus no near-term synergies \n\nwould be expected on the revenue side. Furthermore, Exxon Mobil is a global company which has \n\nactivity almost everywhere in the world while Anadarko is a company with production mainly from \n\nNorth America, thus even if revenues synergies would be considered, they would have a slight \n\nimpact. \n\nAppendix 38: Common exploration and production areas of Anadarko and ExxonMobil \n\nIn the Gulf of Mexico Anadarko has active floating platforms in 34 fields and 60% interest in 279 \n\nblocks, which includes Lucius and Heidelberg. In 2015, ExxonMobil had an average net production \n\nin the Gulf of Mexico of 64 thousand barrels of liquids and 257 million cubic feet of gas per day, \n\nfrom a portfolio of 1.1M net acres. In this area, ExxonMobil has deep water exploration in Keathley \n\nCanyon (KC) (including a participation of 23% in Anadarko-operated Lucius development) and in \n\nWACC (million$) 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025\nEBIT 15.069     16.157     27.592     28.834     30.246     31.756     33.411     35.206     37.360     39.722     \n(+) Depreciation 21.508     23.380     25.382     27.516     29.797     32.233     34.834     37.613     40.535     43.580     \n(-) Tax on EBIT 5.274 -      5.655 -      9.657 -      10.092 -    10.586 -    11.115 -    11.694 -    12.322 -    13.076 -    13.903 -    \n\n (-) ? working capital 5.010       875 -         150 -         199 -         253 -         577 -         475 -         543 -         617 -         643 -         \n(-) Capex 26.244 -    26.746 -    28.593 -    30.485 -    32.586 -    34.796 -    37.166 -    39.695 -    41.749 -    43.499 -    \nFree Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) 10.069     6.261       14.574     15.574     16.618     17.502     18.910     20.259     22.454     25.258     \nDiscounted Cash Flow 9.401       5.457       11.859     11.831     11.785     11.588     11.689     11.691     12.097     12.704     \nResidual Value 345.937   \nEnterprise Value 456.037   \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 84  \n\nWalker Ridge (WR) (including 95% in the Anadarko-operated Heidelberg project). ExxonMobil \n\nalso has conventional and LNG production activities in these areas. \n\nAnadarko\u2019s Southern and Appalachia Region properties are mainly located in Texas, Pennsylvania, \n\nLouisiana, and Kansas and the main exploration areas are Eagleford shale in South Texas, the \n\nDelaware Basin in West Texas, the Marcellus shale in north-central Pennsylvania, and the \n\nHaynesville shale in East Texas and Northern Louisiana. In these regions, Anadarko explores and \n\nproduces both natural gas and liquids. ExxonMobil also has a substantial position in this area: \n\n527.000 net acres in the Marcellus Shale and explorations in Eagleford shale (common area with \n\nAnadarko). \n\nFinally, in the Rocky Mountains region, Anadarko has assets located in Colorado, Utah, and \n\nWyoming (Land Grant) which totals 11.000 wells and interests in near 4.000 non-operated wells. \n\nThis area is considered by Anadarko one of the most valuable areas since it creates completive \n\nadvantage through higher returns from production, drilling without expiration and royalties from \n\nthird-party activity. ExxonMobil also has exploration activities in the Mid-continent states, \n\nincluding the Land Grant. In the company operating report there is no further information, but since \n\nthey are operating in the same regions potential synergies should arise. \n\nAppendix 39: Deal of Exxon and Mobil \n\n\u201cThe major motivations behind the Exxon-Mobil merger, completed in November 1999, were both \n\ncost- and market-based. By combining complementary assets, Exxon-Mobil sought a stronger \n\npresence in the regions of the world with a high potential for future oil and gas discoveries. \n\nComplementary exploration and production operations existed in West Africa, Russia and Eastern \n\nCanada. Because of the increased size of the company it would also be in a stronger position to \n\ninvest in programmes involving large outlays and high prospective risks and returns. At the time \n\nof the merger operating synergies of $2.8 billion were predicted. Two-thirds of the benefits would \n\ncome from eliminating duplicate facilities and excess capacity. Additional synergy benefits would \n\ncome from combined general and administrative costs, and by applying each company\u2019s best \n\nbusiness practices through the world. By 2000 Exxon-Mobil reported that synergies reached $4.6 \n\nbillion.\u201d (Christopher, Harris, &amp; Chavan, 2012) \n\n\n\nJoana Marcelino                          M&amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil

governing the nomination and removal of directors, the prohibition of stockholder \naction by written consent and regulation of stockholders\u2019 ability to bring matters for action before \nannual stockholder meetings, and the authorization given to our Board of Directors to issue and \nset the terms of preferred stock. \nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes restrictions on \nmergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our \noutstanding common stock.\u201d (Anadarko Petroleum Corp, 2016) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n
