The extension event with an Early and a Late Cretaceous phases originated\n\nfour sub-basins that constitutes the Maraj\u00f3 Basin, with a thick continental clastic sequence showing marine\n\ninfluence. NW and NNW normal faults and NE and ENE strike-slip faults controlled the basin geometry. The\n\nextension, related to the Equatorial Atlantic opening, propagated into the continent along crustal weakness\n\nzones of the Precambrian Tumucumaque, Amap\u00e1 and Araguaia orogenic belts. The neotectonic event is a\n\nstrike-slip regime which developed transtensional basins filled in by Upper Tertiary shallow marine (Pirabas\n\nFormation) and transitional sequences (Barreiras Group), followed by Quaternary fluvial deposits and tran-\n\nsitional sequences derived from the Amazon and Tocantins rivers and the Marajoara estuary. The current\n\nlandscape has a typical estuarine morphology. The coast morphology presents sea-cliffs on transitional Up-\n\nper Tertiary sequences, while inwards dominate hills sustained by Mid-Pleistocene lateritic crust, with a flat\n\nerosive surface at 70 m. In the eastern Maraj\u00f3 Island several generations of paleochannels associated with\n\nfluvial-estuarine sequences are recognized, while a fluvial-marine plain is widespread on its western side.\n\nKey words: Maraj\u00f3 Basin, structure, evolution, paleogeography, geomorphology.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBeneath a thick Tertiary sequence in the Maraj\u00f3 Is-\n\nland and adjacent areas there is a large extensional\n\nMesozoic rift system which consists of four major\n\nsub-basins (Mexiana to the north, Limoeiro in the\n\ncenter, and Camet\u00e1 and Mocajuba in the south; Fig-\n\nure 1), evidenced from gravity and magnetic data\n\nand detailed seismic interpretation (Rezende and\n\nFerradaes 1971, Schaller et al. 1971, Miller and\n\nCorrespondence to: Jo\u00e3o Batista Sena Costa\nE-mail: jbsena@iesam.com.br\n*Member of Academia Brasileira de Ci\u00eancias\n\nAvenius 1986, Carvajal et al. 1989).\n\nGeological and geophysical investigations car-\n\nried out by Petr\u00f3leo do Brasil S.A. \u2013 PETROBRAS,\n\nled to delineate the nature of the main structural fea-\n\ntures of the basin, linked to the Gondwana break-\n\nup and Equatorial Atlantic opening (Ludwig 1964,\n\nAguiar et al. 1966, Lana and Milani 1987).

It is divided into the Rift and Post-Rift Se-\n\nquences (Figure 2a).\n\nThe Rift Sequence is formed by two sedimen-\n\ntary units (Miller and Avenius 1986, Carnes et al.\n\n1989, Carvajal et al. 1989). The oldest rift unit\n\ncould be linked to the early rifting and is only rec-\n\nognized by seismic-stratigraphic studies; it appears\n\nto be concordant to the upper one (Carvajal et al.\n\n1989) and it may be Neocomian in age (Carnes et\n\nal. 1989). The youngest unit is related to the widen-\n\ning of the basin, and was defined by seismic inter-\n\npretation and well data samples; it seems to be more\n\nhomogeneous and is characterized by discontinuous\n\nseismic reflectors, and the borehole data indicate de-\n\nposition in continental to transitional environments,\n\nmainly by fluvial and fluvial-deltaic systems (Breves\n\nFormation, Itapecuru Formation in the southeastern\n\nedge of the Camet\u00e1 Sub-Basin).\n\nThe Rift column includes fanglomerates and\n\ncoarse sandstones of talus and alluvial fan deposits\n\n(Jacarezinho Formation) deposited on the west side\n\nof the Mexiana and Limoeiro sub-basins, and along\n\nthe Camet\u00e1 Sub-Basin. Avenius (1988) mentions\n\nthe occurrence of mud-rich silt beds overlying the\n\nBreves Formation, probably deposited in large shal-\n\nlow lakes or, alternatively, during a transgression\n\nrestricted to the Mexiana and Limoeiro sub-basins\n\n(Anaj\u00e1s Formation).\n\nThe seismic signature of the Post - Rift\n\nSequence is characterized by continuous reflectors\n\nformed by alternating layers of clay and silt, ev-\n\nidenced by borehole data from the Mexiana and\n\nLimoeiro sub-basins (Lima 1987). This sequence\n\nincludes two major units (Schaller et al. 1971):\n\nthe lower one (Limoeiro Formation), Paleocene, is\n\nmade up of sandstones and subordinate conglomer-\n\nates and clays; and the upper unit is formed by two\n\npackages, deposited conformably over the Limoeiro\n\nFormation and derived from deltaic and fluvial en-\n\nvironments from Eocene-Pliocene (Maraj\u00f3 Forma-\n\ntion) and Quaternary (Tucunar\u00e9 Formation).\n\nThe upper part of the Maraj\u00f3 Formation is cor-\n\nrelated to the Pirabas Formation, a shallow water\n\nmarine sequence, and Barreiras Group, a transitional\n\none, and have been interpreted as linked to the neo-\n\ntectonics, as well as the Quaternary deposits (Tucu-\n\nnar\u00e9 Formation; Costa et al. 1996).\n\nNeotectonics comprises two sets of structural\n\nand morphological features: (1) the Miocene-\n\nPliocene oldest set includes NW-trending transten-\n\nsional basins, which resulted from displacement\n\nalong E-W and NE-SW dextral strike-slip faults; (2)\n\nthe Pleistocene-Holocene youngest set corresponds\n\nalso to transtensional structures. In the Miocene\n\nthe shallow sea (\u2018\u2018Pirabas sea\u2019\u2019) gradually expanded\n\non the continent and reached 150 km in the north-\n\neastern of the Par\u00e1 State, followed by gradual con-\n\ntraction that allowed the development of the major\n\nrivers. These rivers run chiefly parallel to the NE-\n\nSW strike-slip faults that originated from the reacti-\n\nvation of Mesozoic strike-slip faults throughout the\n\nQuaternary.\n\nThis study, based on prospecting seismic data\n\nand geological mapping, is meant to discuss rift ar-\n\nchitecture, basement control on basin development\n\nand landscape evolution related to the opening of the\n\nEquatorial Atlantic.\n\nSTRUCTURE OF THE MARAJ\u00d3 BASIN\n\nThe disposition of Rift depocenters and depocen-\n\nter controlling faults suggest a half-graben struc-\n\ntural/stratigraphic architecture of the Maraj\u00f3 Basin\n\nwith the sub-basins being separated and segmented\n\nby ENE and NE-SW strike-slip faults (Carnes et al.\n\n1989, Lara 1992, Villegas 1994).\n\nThe Limoeiro Sub-Basin is NW-trending in the\n\ncentral portion of the Maraj\u00f3 Rift and its southern\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2002) 74 (3)\n\n\n\n522 JO\u00c3O B.

At the\n\nnorthern end of the Limoeiro Sub-Basin the major\n\nnormal faults curve northeastward to join the Arari\n\nZone. This sub-basin is divided by minor strike-\n\nslip fault zones (Chaves, Anaj\u00e1s, Par\u00e1 and Limoeiro\n\nzones) into five distinct geometric extensional com-\n\npartments, but their western margins are dominated\n\nby large listric normal faults. Some listric main bor-\n\nder faults have up to 6 km basement normal throw\n\n(Miller and Avenius 1986, Villegas 1994).\n\nThe northwestern portion of the Limoeiro Sub-\n\nBasin have major normal faults which curve north-\n\neastward to join the Arari Zone. This sub-basin is\n\nformed on the west boundary by a series of linked\n\nlistric normal faults gently dipping to the south-\n\neast and reaching a horizontal position at shallower\n\ndepths in the basement (Figure 3a). A roll-over is\n\nwell-developed in the hanging-wall of the detach-\n\nment fault, defined by rotated blocks of the base-\n\nment and lower Rift Sequence into the boundary.\n\nThis large anticline has been partly modified by pla-\n\nnar and listric minor faults dipping towards the east.\n\nThe eastern flank is defined by planar and listric nor-\n\nmal faults dipping about 60o to the west with a roll-\n\nover on the flat-lying segment of the major fault, at\n\ndepth, which dies out gradually upwards on the steep\n\nplanar segment, where dominate an open syncline;\n\nthese features are associated with a large negative\n\nflower structure which affects also the Tertiary pile\n\nand is interpreted as the result of dextral strike-slip\n\ndisplacement along the Arari Zone.\n\nThe central part of the Limoeiro Sub-Basin is\n\ncharacterized on the west by an imbricated fan of\n\nlistric normal faults dipping to the east-northeast,\n\nthat probably become horizontal at a depth of about\n\n15 km, where they should sole into the detachment\n\nzone (Figure 3b). Eastwards, there is another listric\n\nfan with a series of minor normal faults connect-\n\ning to the detachment at shallow depths in the base-\n\nment, which seems to control the development of\n\nthe youngest Rift Sequence (Figure 2a).This imply\n\nthat the Limoeiro Sub-Basin underwent high rate of\n\nextensional collapse during later rifting, which ex-\n\nplains also its greater width (Carnes et al. 1989). A\n\nseries of listric faults also define the east boundary\n\nof this sub-basin, but there are normal faults cut-\n\nting the entire Rift pile suggesting several pulses of\n\nfaulting (Figure 3c). There are often high blocks\n\nof the basement in the center separating the earlier\n\nRift depocentres near the sub-basin flanks (Figure\n\n3d). This geometry can be followed southeastwards\n\nuntil the Tocantins Zone.\n\nA large isolated NNW-trending basement horst\n\nblock separates the Camet\u00e1 from the Mocajuba Sub-\n\nBasin (Figure 2b). The Camet\u00e1 Sub-Basin displays\n\nan asymmetric geometry formed by three smaller de-\n\npocenters bounded on the west flanks by planar and\n\nlistric normal faults dipping to the NNE. The roll-\n\nover is followed on both the basement and filling,\n\nbut a synform dominates upwards on the steep seg-\n\nments of the major faults. The eastern margin of the\n\nsub-basin is dominated by a broad flexural response\n\nto the border fault system of the west since the base-\n\nment and lower Rift Sequence dip away from the\n\nboundary (Figure 3e). The geometry throughout the\n\nMocajuba is similar to that of the Camet\u00e1 Sub-Basin,\n\nbut it has been suggested that the basement horst\n\nblock may have been an effective barrier against\n\nintrabasinal communication allowing a package of\n\nsediments unique to the rest of the basin to be de-\n\nposited (Carvajal et al. 1989).\n\nThe interpretation of potential field data\n\n(Bouguer and magnetic maps) and seismic lines has\n\nindicated the possible existence of strike-slip zones\n\nbounding geometric distinct basin compartments.\n\nMost of them display evidence of multi-tectonic\n\nphases during the basin evolution, even during the\n\npost-rift phase. They played an important role dur-\n\ning the normal fault propagation and, likely, con-\n\ntrolled the stratigraphy along the axis of the basin,\n\nand can be interpreted as transfer faults since they\n\nprobably accommodated much extension parallel to\n\nthe extensional axis of the stress field. The usual\n\nseismic signatures of these fault zones (Arari, Cha-\n\nves, Anaj\u00e1s, Par\u00e1, Limoeiro, Tocantins, Carapij\u00f3 and\n\nSanta Rosa; Figure 2b) are negative flower struc-\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2002) 74 (3)\n\n\n\n524 JO\u00c3O B.

Seismic interpretations indicated that this\n\nzone is defined by right-stepping en ech\u00e9lon pairs\n\nof overlapping pull-apart sub-basins, of which the\n\nMexiana Sub-Basin is the best known feature, with\n\nsteep larger border faults on both the east and west\n\nmargins. The thick Tertiary and Quaternary sedi-\n\nmentary piles deposited in the Mexiana Sub-Basin\n\nimplies that the Arari Zone remained active through-\n\nout the Cenozoic. The available data suggest a multi-\n\nphase tectonic evolution for the Mexiana Sub-Basin\n\nwhich includes the following steps: (1) transtension\n\nduring the Cretaceous controlling the deposition of\n\na sedimentary sequence more than 5 km in thick; (2)\n\ntranspression probably in the Late Cretaceous induc-\n\ning chiefly folding; and (3) transtension throughout\n\nthe Cenozoic originating the Tertiary and Quater-\n\nnary piles.\n\nThe neotectonic setting is defined by a series\n\nof linked E-W and NE-SW dextral strike-slip faults\n\nand NW-SE normal faults that are grouped into two\n\nsets. The oldest set corresponds to NW-SE nor-\n\nmal faults that controlled the deposition of the shal-\n\nlow water marine sequence (Pirabas Formation) and\n\ntransitional sequence (Barreiras Group) in the Up-\n\nper Tertiary. The youngest set refers to a linked sys-\n\ntem of strike-slip faults and normal faults forming\n\nPleistocene-Holocene pull-apart basins of variable.\n\nLarge slightly rotated blocks, which originated\n\nby Upper Pleistocene NW-SE normal faults, domi-\n\nnate in the current landscape of the Maraj\u00f3 Island.\n\nThe sea-cliffs and paleochannels widespread in the\n\neastern side of the island are closely related to the up-\n\nlifted blocks, contrasting with large floodplain and\n\ndense rectangular drainage pattern of the western\n\nside which were developed on subsided blocks. The\n\nMaraj\u00f3 Island formed due to the reactivation of the\n\nArari and Tocantins zones which, respectively, cap-\n\ntured the lower courses of the Amazonas and To-\n\ncantins rivers to the northeast throughout the Qua-\n\nternary.\n\nGEOPHYSICAL SIGNATURE OF THE MARAJ\u00d3 BASIN\nAND THE SURROUNDING BASEMENT\n\nThe old tectonic setting of the area around Maraj\u00f3\n\nBasin (Figure 1) is characterized by the Araguaia and\n\nTumucumaque orogenic or shear belts which have\n\nbeen interpreted as the result of Precambrian conti-\n\nnental collisions (Hasui et al. 1993, Costa and Hasui\n\n1997). The continuity of the Araguaia and Tumu-\n\ncumaque belts, respectively, to north-northwest and\n\nsoutheast, coincides with the area where the Maraj\u00f3\n\nBasin was developed.\n\nThe Araguaia Belt trends N-S to NNW-SSE and\n\nis composed of meta-sedimentary, mafic and ultra-\n\nmafic rocks (Baixo Araguaia Super-Group), migma-\n\ntized gneisses and granitoids (Colm\u00e9ia Complex),\n\nand high-grade gneisses (Porto Nacional Complex)\n\nin the southeastern margin (Hasui and Costa 1990,\n\nHasui et al. 1993). The Tumucumaque Belt, with a\n\nNW-SE trend, is exposed from near Macap\u00e1 to Para-\n\nmaribo (Suriname) and comprises various rock as-\n\nsemblages: granulitic rocks (mafic granulites, kin-\n\nzigites, enderbitic and charnockitic gneisses) of the\n\nAnana\u00ed and Tartarugal Grande suites; medium-grade\n\ntonalitic to trondhjemitic gneisses and granitoids of\n\nthe Guianense Complex; supracrustal rocks (meta-\n\nvolcanics, iron formations, quartzites, micaschists\n\nand metagraywakes) of the Vila Nova Group (Jo\u00e3o\n\net al. 1979, Lima et al. 1974).\n\nThe structural framework of these belts consists\n\nof imbricated ductile thrusts systems that are char-\n\nacterized by a pervasive mylonitic foliation dipping\n\nto the east and northeast. Along the Araguaia Belt\n\nthere are also NW to NNW-trending strike-slip shear\n\nzones that have been interpreted as lateral ramps that\n\naccommodated large amount of compression (Hasui\n\nand Costa 1990).\n\nAnother belt (Amap\u00e1 Belt), adjacent and paral-\n\nlel to the Arari Zone, was suggested by potential field\n\ndata interpretation, but it has not been studied be-\n\ncause it is completely covered by Tertiary and Qua-\n\nternary sedimentary deposits (Hasui et al. 1984).\n\nThe Bouguer map for the Maraj\u00f3 Basin and sur-\n\nrounding areas is shown in Figure 4. NW-trending\n\npositive and negative gravity anomalies are evident\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2002) 74 (3)\n\n\n\n526 JO\u00c3O B. S. COSTA et al.\n\nand they are not always coincident with the highs\n\nand depocentres of the sub-basins. Several magnetic\n\nanomalies also exist: the bipolar anomalies are not\n\nrelated to magnetic geological bodies in the basin\n\nfilling as these are absent, and the linear anomalies\n\nare only partly linked to the major fault zones.\n\nAs referred above, the Tumucumaque and Ara-\n\nguaia belts are formed by large variety of litho-\n\nstratigraphic units, which correspond to high and\n\nlow density/more and less magnetic rocks, besides\n\nstrike-slip ductile shear zones. This implies that\n\nthese rock assemblages should display positive and\n\nnegative gravity anomaly signatures, as well as bipo-\n\nlar and linear magnetic anomalies. Therefore, the\n\ngeophysical patterns are thought to be mostly due\n\nto the rock units and structures of the Precambrian\n\nshear belts.\n\nIt has been also deduced that the distinct ge-\n\nometric compartments of the Mexiana, Limoeiro,\n\nCamet\u00e1 and Mocajuba sub-basins are closely related\n\nto the complex patterns of the ductile thrust systems\n\nand strike-slip shear zones of these belts. This is\n\nsupported by the detachment normal faults dipping\n\nto the east and northeast and following the ductile\n\nthrust systems, and by the NE-trending anomalies\n\nalong the Arari Zone coinciding with the strike-slip\n\nfaulting propagation during the Mesozoic, proba-\n\nbly starting with reactivation of shear zones of the\n\nAmap\u00e1 Belt.\n\nIn summary, the Precambrian tectonic setting\n\nsuggests a strong control of the Araguaia and Tumu-\n\ncumaque belts in the geometry of the major faults\n\nof the Maraj\u00f3 Basin. However, if the Amap\u00e1 Belt\n\nis confirmed, this feature and the Araguaia Belt are\n\nto be regarded as the pre-existing crustal weakness\n\nzones for the Mesozoic extensional propagation into\n\nthe northern Brazil.\n\nPALEOGEOGRAPHY\n\nDuring the Paleozoic the Maraj\u00f3 region and sur-\n\nrounding areas interconnected the Amazonas and\n\nParna\u00edba basins as demonstrated by the remnants\n\nof Paleozoic sequences preserved in faulted blocks\n\non the shoulders of the Maraj\u00f3 Rift (Gurup\u00e1 Arch;\n\nLima 1987). However, probably by the end of the\n\nPaleozoic or Early Mesozoic, the Gurup\u00e1 high had\n\ndeveloped into a well defined horst block with steep\n\nnormal faults delineating its flanks. The faults of\n\nthe east flank of the Gurup\u00e1 Horst form the western\n\nmargin of the Maraj\u00f3 Rift.\n\nThe Maraj\u00f3 Rift may have begun forming in\n\nthe Early Mesozoic as a result of the separation of\n\nthe South American, North American and African\n\nplates. The early phase of rifting is thought to be\n\nof Late Triassic in age with the incipient rifting of\n\nthe North Atlantic propagated into the South Amer-\n\nican Plate. This is supported by the plate restoration\n\nwhich shows that the Maraj\u00f3 region is on trend with\n\nthe early rifting stage of the North Atlantic (Miller\n\nand Avenius 1986, Carvajal et al. 1989). A Late\n\nTriassic-Early Jurassic age for the initial develop-\n\nment of the Maraj\u00f3 Rift coincides also with the mag-\n\nmatic event represented by dyke intrusions (Cassi-\n\npor\u00e9 Diabase, 250 to 180 Ma; Lima et al. 1974)\n\nin Paleozoic sequences and Precambrian basement,\n\nbut the ages of the propagation of the earliest exten-\n\nsional half-grabens are uncertain, mainly because\n\nthe early Rift Sequence has not yet been sampled.\n\nSeveral major seismic packages have been\n\ndemonstrated throughout the basin. The early Rift\n\nSequence is restricted to the both flanks of the Li-\n\nmoeiro Sub-Basin and the west flanks of Mexiana\n\nand Camet\u00e1 sub-basins, and shows the tendency to\n\nthicken into rift faults suggesting distribution in re-\n\nsponse to active rifting (Carvajal et al. 1989). This\n\ninterval and the late Rift Sequence are believed to be\n\ncomposed chiefly of fanglomerates derived from the\n\nGurup\u00e1 Horst partly during the Albian as suggested\n\nby continental clastic interval in the upper portion\n\n(Figure 5a).\n\nDuring the entire rift period a major fluvial sys-\n\ntem probably flowed into Maraj\u00f3 from the west and\n\nsoutheast (Bemerguy and Costa 1991). Some sed-\n\niments came into the Maraj\u00f3 region from eastern\n\nand northern, but these areas are regarded as less\n\nimportant sediment sources at least in the later rift\n\nstage because part of the Par\u00e1-Maranh\u00e3o Platform\n\nwas collapsing due to the spreading of the South At-\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2002) 74 (3)\n\n\n\nTECTONICS AND PALEOGEOGRAPHY OF THE MARAJ\u00d3 BASIN 527\n\nMACAP\u00c1\n\nN\n\n0 50\n\nkm\n\nSedimentary cover\n\nPrecambrian basement\n\n-10 Bouguer anomaly curves (mGal)\n\nA T L A N T I C\nO C E A N\n\nBEL\u00c9M\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-1\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n3\n0\n\n4\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n10\n\n30\n20\n\n-20\n\n10\n\n0\n-10\n\n2\n0\n\n3\n0\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n10\n-10\n\n0\n\n-30\n\n20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n-3\n0\n\n-2\n0 10\n\n-1\n0\n\n20\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n- 40\n- 50\n\n-50\n\n-1\n0 20\n\n-1\n0\n\n0\n10\n\n10\n\n20\n\n-30\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-1\n0\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n-1\n0\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-\n2\n0\n\n-\n3\n0\n\n-\n4\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n-1\n0\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n-20-10\n\n-30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n-20\n-30\n\n-\n40\n\n-50 -40\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-2\n0\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n- 30\n\n- 40\n\n- 50\n\n- 60\n\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n20\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-20\n\n-1\n0\n\n-1\n0\n\n-2\n0 -3\n\n0\n\n- 40\n- 50\n\n- 60\n\n-20\n\n- 60\n\n10\n\n- 10\n- 20\n\n20\n\n10\n20\n\n0\n\n-1\n0\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n-20\n\n0\n\nMaraj\u00f3 Basin\n\nFig. 4 \u2013 Simplified Bouguer anomaly map of the Maraj\u00f3 rift and surrounding areas.\n\nlantic rifting (Figure 5b).

The Post-Rift Sequence de-\n\nposited from Maastrichtian times to the Early\n\nOligocene, probably over an area of little physio-\n\ngraphic variation since it is characterized by a fairly\n\ncontinuos package composed of fluvial and deltaic\n\nclastics which thickens to the north, where a marine\n\ninfluence is demonstrated by a brown shale inter-\n\nval in the basal Post-Rift Sequence of the Limoeiro\n\nand Mexiana sub-basins (Figure 5c). This inter-\n\nval represents Late Paleocene-Early Maastrichtian\n\nage marine sediments (Rezende and Ferradaes 1971,\n\nSchaller et al. 1971), and thins westward due to the\n\nsediment load of the Amazon River (Avenius 1988).\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2002) 74 (3)\n\n\n\nTECTONICS AND PALEOGEOGRAPHY OF THE MARAJ\u00d3 BASIN 529\n\nThe sediments supplied by the Tocantins River have\n\nbeen covered the southern Limoeiro, Mocajuba and\n\nCamet\u00e1 sub-basins.\n\nThe Eocene marks another marine incursion\n\nin the Maraj\u00f3 Basin that reaches the northwestern\n\nCamet\u00e1 Sub-Basin. In this sub-basin the transitional\n\nenvironment is evidenced from flaser structures and\n\nwidespread bioturbed sediments, as well as black\n\nshales with high organic content derived probably\n\nfrom mangroves (Schaller et al. 1971). During the\n\nEocene-Oligocene the major hydrographic basins\n\nof the Amazon region (Solim\u00f5es, Madeira, Negro,\n\nAmazonas etc.) has flowed eastward due to the An-\n\ndean uplifting. This suggests that the sediment load-\n\ning of the Amazon drainage system has greatly af-\n\nfected the northwestern portion of the Maraj\u00f3 Basin\n\nsince the Late Eocene.\n\nIn the Miocene-Pliocene much of the Maraj\u00f3\n\nregion and surrounded areas subsided in response to\n\ntranstension linked to the dextral strike-slip regime\n\nof the neotectonic scenario. This led to marine in-\n\ncursion over large areas in the northern Brazil which\n\nis demonstrated by shallow water marine sequence\n\n(Pirabas Formation) followed by transitional se-\n\nquence (Barreiras Group) exposed along the coast\n\nand underlain the Pleistocene deposits up to 150 km\n\nin the continent (Figure 5d).\n\nThe current landscape of the Maraj\u00f3 region and\n\nsurrounded areas is characterized by fluvial deposits\n\nof the Amazon and Tocantins rivers greatly influ-\n\nenced by marine incursions. This fluvial-stuarine\n\nmorphology is the result of the Tocantins River cap-\n\ntured to the northeast and Maraj\u00f3 Island formation\n\nin the Late Pleistocene (Bemerguy 1997; Figure 5e).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe overall arcuate shape of the Maraj\u00f3 Rift and\n\ncomplex faulting geometry of the sub-basins are\n\nbelieved to be controlled by the combined weak\n\nzones of three distinct Precambrian orogenic belts.\n\nGeneral trends and fault patterns of the Mocajuba,\n\nCamet\u00e1 and Limoeiro sub-basins are strongly influ-\n\nenced by ductile thrusts and strike-slip shear zones\n\nwithin the Araguaia and Tumucumaque belts, while\n\nthe trend and fault systems of the Mexiana Sub-\n\nBasin run parallel to the weakness zones of the Ama-\n\np\u00e1 Belt.\n\nRegional tectonic and stratigraphic evidence\n\nsuggests that the Maraj\u00f3 Rift has a half-graben ar-\n\nchitecture that developed as a result of Mesozoic\n\nextension and shearing. Several strike-slip faults\n\nsegmented the basin into geometric distinct exten-\n\nsional compartments and controlled the stratigraphy\n\nalong its axis. Some faults are always characterized\n\nby smaller pull-apart sub-basins along striking with\n\nthe Mexiana Sub-Basin being attributed to the en\n\nech\u00e9lon pattern within the Arari Zone. Therefore,\n\nMocajuba, Camet\u00e1 and Limoeiro sub-basins are pri-\n\nmarily extensional while the Mexiana Sub-Basin is\n\ngreatly transtensional.\n\nThe Rift Sequence developed in response to\n\nactive rifting and was filled by continental clastic\n\nsediments derived chiefly from the Gurup\u00e1 Arch. In\n\ncontrast, the Post-Rift Sequence deposited during\n\na large quiescence period and received fluvial and\n\ndeltaic clastics with marine influence in the north-\n\nwestern of the basin, throughout the Late Creta-\n\nceous-Early Oligocene.\n\nMuch of the current landscape is due to trans-\n\ntension linked to strike-slip faults, which derived\n\nchiefly from the Mesozoic strike-slip faults reacti-\n\nvation since Miocene.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe are grateful to PETROBRAS that kindly pro-\n\nvided the seismic lines, the Bouguer anomaly data\n\nand unpublished reports for this study and the Mas-\n\nter Thesis of J.M.
