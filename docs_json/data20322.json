The gaps in 3D data can cause adverse impacts in several steps of \nthe data processing such as velocity analysis, multiple attenuation, stacking \nand migration. Flex Binning is an expedient method to solve these gaps.

The challenge is to apply Flex Binning to very large number \nof traces exceeding current software design solutions and hardware capability. \nSeveral tests were performed with the Seismic Processing Workshop (SPW) \nsoftware. During several tests, coding problems and bugs were detected and \ncorrected, such as the inability to apply a grid to the dataset and leave traces \nout of the grid. Also, proper indexing was also solved by a change of software \ndesign in CMP Binning code. Beta testing on SPW allowed advances in the \nimplementation of Flex Binning to large inputs, namely the execution of the \nCMP Binning flow successfully to a dataset with 751GB.

Introduction \n\n1.1 Nature and scope of this work \n\nThe present dissertation is the result of a curricular internship at Geosurveys - Geophysical \n\nConsultants (GS), based in Aveiro (Portugal), for a period of eleven months, within the discipline \n\nof Dissertation / Project / Internship of the 2nd year of the Master's Degree in Geological \n\nEngineering (2nd cycle) of the University of Aveiro, under the supervision of Dr. Henrique Duarte, \n\nDirector of the Geosurveys Marine Geophysics Department, and Professor Lu\u00eds Menezes Pinheiro \n\nof the Department of Geosciences of the University of Aveiro. \n\n \n\n1.2 The Geosurveys \u2013 Geophysical Consultants \n\nThe GS was formed in 1999 from an ambitious project, fundamentally oriented to the Prospecting \n\nGeophysics and Earth Sciences. To meet market needs, Geosurveys specializes in the areas of \n\nGeophysical Prospecting and Geology Onshore, Near-shore &amp; Offshore, in the various fields of it is \n\napplication, namely water resources, planning and management of projects in geophysics, \n\nenvironmental impact, archeology and patrimony, geotechnics and civil engineering, mining \n\nprospecting, and risk of natural catastrophes. \n\nConsidering the services provided and in order to effectively manage the resources and \n\nemployees, Geosurveys is divided into three Departments: The Financial Department, led by the \n\nGeneral Manager Francisco Sobral; the Department of Marine Geophysics, headed by Senior \n\nGeophysicist Henrique Duarte; and the Department of Geophysics on Earth, led by Senior \n\nGeophysicist Carlos Grangeia. The position of Executive Director is occupied by the Senior \n\nGeophysicist H\u00e9lder Hermosilha. \n\nThese departments consist of multidisciplinary teams of geophysicists, geologists and geological \n\nengineers, distributed between office and field, who work to give a good response to the various \n\nneeds of the various clients. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n1.3 Objectives of this work \n\nDuring the eleven-month internship at Geosurveys, in addition to the academic learning strand \n\nand the main goal of the research project, it was intended to obtain a professional experience in a \n\nbusiness environment, as well as the familiarization with the way a company operates in the field \n\nof Marine Geophysics; these objectives have been fully met. \n\nThroughout this internship, several tasks were developed in the scope of the company's operating \n\nmethods, in order to get familiar with the daily routines of the workers in a multi-channel seismic \n\nreflection data processing workstation, to learn to use processing and geological interpretation \n\nsoftware, such as RadEx Pro (Deco Geophysical), ProMAX (Landmark Graphics Corporation) and \n\nKingdom Suite (IHS Energy) as well as other industry standard software. Some of this knowledge \n\nwas applied to the case study presented in this thesis.  \n\nIn order to gain experience and grow on a professional level, participation as a Trainee in some of \n\nthe processing and geological interpretation projects carried out by the company has contributed \n\nextensively for this purpose. After an initial period of adjustment, the main activities concentrated \n\non the proposed research work on the challenges of the application of the Flex Binning method to \n\nlarge datasets.  \n\n3D seismic reflection data may contain coverage gaps due to operational problems. These gaps \n\ncan cause adverse impacts in several steps of the data processing such as velocity analysis, \n\nmultiple attenuation, stacking and migration. Flex Binning is an expedient method to solve these \n\ngaps. This method allows each bin to contain more traces, by increasing the effective size of each \n\nbin and thereby including traces which also fall into neighboring bins.  \n\nThe main objective and challenge of this project is to apply Flex Binning to very large number of \n\ntraces exceeding current software design solutions and hardware capability. Several tests were \n\nperformed on the Seismic Processing Workshop software. Beta testing on SPW carried out in the \n\nscope of this wok allowed significant advances to be made in the implementation of Flex Binning \n\nand made possible its application to large input datasets. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n1.4 Location of the Study Area \n\nThe study area is the Hornsea Offshore Windfarm Project One (HOW01), located in the southern \n\nNorth Sea, about 150 km from the Eastern coast of England, Great Britain (Figure 1).   \n\n \n\nFigure 1.

The 3D Ultra High Resolution Seismic \n\nReflection Method  \n\n2.1 Basic Principles and Fundamentals \n\nThe seismic reflection method, consists in emitting seismic waves (or seismic pulses) from at or \n\nnear surface and record their return to the surface after reflection on the interfaces between the \n\nvarious subsurface formations with different acoustic and physical properties, and measuring the \n\ntraveltimes and amplitudes, in order to reconstruct the subsurface geology. According to the \n\nSnell\u2019s Law (Equation 1), the incident wave at an interface between two distinct layers is divided \n\ninto a refracted part that continues to propagate downward in a slightly different direction than \n\nthe incident wave and a reflected part that travels back to the surface.  \n\n     \n     \n\n \n  \n  \n\n (Eq.1) \n\nWhere    is the incident angle,    is the refracted angle, and    and    represent the velocities of \n\nthe seismic waves in two different media.   \n\nIn reality, what happens in the case of the non-normal incidence (Figure 2) is that there is a \n\npartition of energy at the interface and there will be wave mode conversion at the interface: \n\nshear waves (S-waves) are converted to longitudinal waves (P-waves) and vice-versa (Sheriff and \n\nGeldart, 1995; Telford et al., 1990). In order to determine the amplitude of the various reflected \n\nand refracted waves at a plane interface for an incident P-wave it is necessary to apply the \n\nZoeppritz equations (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995; Telford et al., 1990).  \n\nThe P-waves are longitudinal and compressive, and travel at a velocity that depends on the elastic \n\nproperties and densities of the rocks. The medium particles during S-wave propagation vibrate in \n\na transverse way, with oscillatory movement\u2019s perpendicular to the direction of propagation, \n\ncausing shear when the wave is transmitted, and propagate slower than the P-waves. Another \n\ncharacteristic of the S-waves it is that they cannot propagate in fluids, since these are not capable \n\nto suffer shear. \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Schematic image of the seismic wave between two media with different physical properties. The non-normal \n\nincidence.      and     represent the density values for the two different layers.    and     represent the velocity values \n\nof the seismic waves (adapted from Ribeiro, 2011). \n \n\nIn order to get information about the subsurface geology, as well as the rock properties and layers \n\nattitude, the traveltimes and amplitude of the reflected waves from the source through the \n\nsubsurface and then back to the receivers are recorded, processed and interpreted. \n\nThe two-way time (TWT) is the time that a wave takes to travel from its source, down to an \n\ninterface between two layers with different physical properties (specifically the density (?) and \n\nthe seismic wave velocity (V)) and back to the surface where it is recorded by the receivers. The \n\nacoustic impedance (Z) is the product of the density the formation by the velocity of propagation \n\nof the waves in that formation.  \n\nThe difference between the formations with diverse physical proprieties provides us with a \n\ncontrast of acoustic impedance (Z). The Reflection Coefficient (RC) between two layers, for the \n\nsimplified case of normal incidence is proportional to the acoustic impedance contrast (Equation 2, \n\nvalid only for normal incidence). \n\n   \n           \n           \n\n \n     \n     \n\n (Eq.2) \n\nThe seismic dataset obtained after a seismic survey and its fundamental properties, such as the \n\nseismic resolution, are principally determined by the acquisition parameters and by the system \n\ncharacteristics (in particular its frequency spectrum). After acquisition, the next step is data \n\nprocessing, and this step can significantly improve the image resolution and attenuate unwanted \n\nnoise within some limits. The resolution, in a general way, can be defined as the ability to \n\ndistinguish two very closely distinct objects. The seismic resolution is directly related to the \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n \n\nfrequency and duration of the pulse. Power sources that emit high-frequency pulses have higher \n\nresolution and therefore a greater ability to detect thin layers. \n\nThus, seismic resolution is a matter of major importance in seismic data acquisition (Yilmaz, 2001). \n\nUHRS (Ultra High Resolution Seismic) data was used in this work, and normally has a denser data \n\nacquired and contains a range of frequencies above 500 Hz to 5kHz.  \n\n \n\nVertical resolution \n\nThe vertical resolution of the seismic wave is defined as the minimum thickness of a layer \n\nrequired to distinguish a reflection from its top to the base, i.e. the ability to recognize individual, \n\nclosely-spaced distinct reflectors. The vertical resolution is determined by the pulse length (or \n\nfrequency) of the seismic system. The seismic frequency is directly related to the vertical \n\nresolution: higher frequency provides higher resolution. The frequency is expressed as number of \n\ncycles per second (1cycle/s = 1Hertz) and higher frequencies mean shorter pulses and \n\nconsequently better vertical resolution (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995; Kearey et al. , 2002).  \n\nThe top and the base of a stratigraphic unit (two distinguish reflectors), can be recognized as \n\nseparated seismic events only if the distance between them is at least \u00bc of wavelength (?) of the \n\nseismic wavelet (Equation 3; McQuillin et al., 1984). \n\n  \n \n\n \n (Eq.3) \n\nWhere V is the seismic wave velocity in the layer and f is frequency. \n\nAs the waves travel in the subsurface, the seismic wave will lose the highest frequencies in depth, \n\nbecause they are more rapidly absorbed. Thus, high-frequencies waves are attenuated much \n\nfaster than low-frequencies. The higher frequency, the lower will therefore be the depth \n\npenetration, but the higher will be the vertical resolution. \n\n \nHorizontal resolution \n\nThe horizontal resolution of a seismic wave is principally controlled by the \u201c1st Fresnel Zone\u201d that \n\nconsists of the area of the sub-surface that contributes to the reflection. A reflection that is \n\ncoming back to the surface is being reflected not from a reflecting point, but from an area with \n\nthe dimension of the \u201cFirst Fresnel Zone\u201d.  \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n \n\nThe \u201cFirst Fresnel Zone\u201d according to the Huygens\u2019s principle is an area where the waves interfere \n\nwith each other constructively. This principle also states that each part of a wave front acts as a \n\nsource of a new wave (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Schematic representation of the First Fresnel Zone (Kearey et al., 1991). \n \n\nAs shown in Equation 4, the radius of the 1st Fresnel Zone (FR) depends on the average seismic \n\nvelocity on the layer (V), the depth of the target (t, in TWT) and the frequency of the seismic \n\nsignal (f) (Sheriff and Geldart, 199). The Fresnel zone increases, and consequently horizontal \n\nresolution decreases, with increasing velocity of the propagating medium and travel-time (depth), \n\nand also with lower signal frequency. \n\n   \n \n\n \n ?\n\n \n\n \n (Eq.4) \n\nDiffractions \n\nThe presence of discontinuities at the interfaces between the various layers, for example due to \n\nthe presence of faults (Figure 4) or a very irregular topography of the reflecting interface, \n\ngenerates diffractions, which appear in the seismic sections as hyperbolae. These diffractions \n\nappear because the interface between the formations truncates abruptly, then secondary waves \n\ndo not cancel at the edge, and diffraction is observed (Huygens\u2019s principle). In data processing \n\nwith migration, it is possible to collapse the hyperbolae. \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4. Schematic image of the diffraction caused by the truncated end of a faulted layer (Kearey et al., 2002). \n\n \n\nMultiples \n\nThe presence of multiple reflections in the seismic sections due to reflections, for example at the \n\nwater / air interface in a marine environment or multiple internal reflections in the various layers \n\nin the presence of strong acoustic impedance contrasts, makes interpretation very difficult. They \n\ncan be attenuated with special processing techniques (i.e. during the stack), but their total \n\nremoval is a virtually impossible task \u2013 significant advances in processing have however been \n\nachieved in recent years. There are diverse types of multiple reflections as can be seen in Figure 5. \n\n \n\nFigure 5. Distinct types of multiple reflection in a layer (Kearey et al., 2002). \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n2.2 Seismic Data Acquisition \n\nIn the acquisition of multi-channel seismic reflection data in marine environment, a streamer of \n\nhydrophones and a seismic source are towed behind a ship. The streamer will be receiving the \n\nreflected waves from the subsurface and convert them into electrical signals.  \n\nIn the 2D seismic marine acquisition, a single streamer is used (Figure 6 A); in 3D seismic marine \n\nacquisition several streamers are towed behind the vessel (Figure 6 B), and the shooting direction \n\n(boat track) is called the inline direction (Yilmaz, 2001). The three-dimensional (3D) seismic \n\nacquisition method appeared only in 1972, when the American G.G. Walton presented it for the \n\nfirst time to the scientific community. \n\n \n\nFigure 6. Schematic images the two types of seismic acquisition on sea. A) 2D seismic acquisition (Kearey et al., 2002). B) \n\n3D seismic acquisition (http://wikigrewal.com/offshore-marine-seismic-surveying/). \n \n\nThe 3D seismic marine acquisition has several advantages over the two-dimensional seismic \n\nacquisition: it resolves the structural and stratigraphic details of the subsurface that were missing \n\nor were simply not visible in 2D seismic, and therefore it is possible to visualize the potential \n\nreservoirs (oil and gas) in three dimensions, allowing the interpreter to obtain detailed \n\ninformation on faults and fractures, stratification planes, presence of pores and fluids, complex \n\nstructural geology and detailed stratigraphy. It also allows correct positioning of the reflectors in \n\n3D. \n\nAlthough the 3D seismic marine acquisition has several advantages, it is more expensive, and \n\nrequires more sophisticated and more expensive equipment, and therefore it takes more time to \n\ncheck if all the equipment, including the multiple streamers, is working and ready for acquisition. \n\nThe 3D seismic marine acquisition is a complex method and therefore the acquisition geometry is \n\nalso complex if good azimuth illumination coverage is intended. \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n \n\nThe traditional geometry used in 3D data acquisition uses lines previously delineated over the \n\narea of interest. After completing each navigation route, the vessel goes to the next acquisition \n\nline, (transit time), in the opposite direction, parallel to the previous one (Figure 7 A). During the \n\nchange of direction/acquisition line there will be a change in the position of the sources and \n\nreceivers resulting in non-productive time. \n\nFor the optimization of non-productive time, new acquisition geometries were developed. As an \n\nexample, we have Wide-Azimuth (Buia et al., 2008) and Coil Shooting (Buia et al., 2008). \n\n \n\nFigure 7. Schematic images of the three type\u2019s ways to make a 3D seismic acquisition on sea. A) The basic 3-D \n\nAcquisition, this is the most traditional way (Buia et al., 2008). B) The Wide-azimuth survey (Buia et al., 2008) C) The Coil \n\nshooting acquisition technique (Buia et al., 2008). \n \n\nIn Wide-Azimuth (Figure 7 B) the same acquisition pattern is used as in the traditional acquisition, \n\nbut with several vessels that shoot sequentially in different directions for the same streamers, \n\nwhich allows better azimuthal coverage of the study area. This method proved to obtain better \n\ndata namely, less noise, better resolution, improvements in the attenuation of multiples and the \n\nquality of the reflectors, simplifying the seismic interpretation (Buia et al., 2008). \n\nThe Coil Shooting (Figure 7 C) is a technique, proposed by the company Schlumberger, for seismic \n\nacquisition that uses a circular pattern for data collection, with little or no unproductive time. It \n\nallows getting data of short offsets, something not possible by the traditional geometry and \n\ninvolves only a single ship equipped with several seismic sources and streamers, and that runs a \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n \n\ncontinuous circular trajectory on the study area (Buia et al., 2008). In circular geometries, we \n\nobtain azimuth coverage values in the order of 90% while in parallel line geometries the \n\nacquisition productivity drops to approximately 45%. From the economic point of view, it is more \n\nlucrative to use the WAZ method in large areas of exploration and Coil Shooting in small/medium \n\nareas (Buia et al., 2008). \n\n \n\n2.2.1 Marine Seismic Sources  \n\nThere is a wide variety of seismic sources characterized by diverse levels of energy, typical \n\nfrequencies and method of operation. Frequencies of the seismic sources can range from 1Hz to \n\nseveral hundred or even thousands of hertz (Figure 8). \n\n \n\nFigure 8. Acoustic spectrum of different seismic sources (Kearey et al., 2002). \n \n\nThe data used in this master thesis came from a high frequency seismic source, in this case, a \n\nSparker. The sparkers are equipment\u2019s that convert electrical energy into acoustic energy, \n\nthrough a pulse that is generated by the discharge of a large capacitors to create a spark between \n\ntwo electrodes inside conducting water.  \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n \n\nThe operating voltages are characteristically 3.5\u20134.0 kV and peak currents may exceed 200 A. This \n\nelectrical discharge leads to the formation and rapid growth of a plasma bubble and the \n\nconsequent generation of an acoustic pulse (Kearey et al., 2002). \n\n \n\n2.2.2 Marine Seismic Receivers  \n\nIn order to receive and record the reflected seismic waves when the acquisition campaigns are \n\nmade at sea, streamers are used, which are arrays of hydrophones, distributed over several \n\nchannels along an extensive plastic tube filled with a liquid that allows the streamer keep to the \n\nsurface. \n\nThe hydrophones are composed of ceramic piezoelectric elements (Figure 9) which produce an \n\noutput electrical signal (voltage) proportional to the pressure variations associated with the \n\npassage of a compressional seismic wave through water.  \n\nThe sensitivity of this equipment is typically 0.1mVPa\n-1\n\n (Kearey et al., 2002). Each crystal element \n\nconsists of an annular piezoelectric ring, metallic-coated on both surfaces, bonded at the open \n\nends by thin convex metallic diaphragms.  \n\n \n\nFigure 9. Schematic image of hydrophone (adapted from Reynolds, 1997). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n2.3 Basic Seismic Data Processing \n\nThe typical seismic processing flows are implemented to increase the seismic vertical resolution, \n\nimprove the signal-to-noise ratio of the data and to display the seismic events in their correct \n\nspatial position (Yilmaz, 2001;  McQuillin et al., 1984; Kearey et al., 1991). \n\nA typical processing flow for a 2D survey is composed by a first part known as the pre-processing \n\nstage, and a second part which constitutes the specific processing flow. The pre-processing \n\nincludes: demultiplexing, quality control, trace editing, filtering, spherical divergence and gain \n\ncorrections, and geometry and static corrections; the second part normally includes: \n\ndeconvolution, filtering, CMP sorting, velocity analysis, normal moveout (NMO) correction, CMP \n\nstack and migration (Yilmaz, 2001). The first step in pre-processing is to perform the \n\ndemultiplexing, an operation that consists of reorganizing the data to a format appropriate for \n\nprocessing as shot gathers. Conventionally, in the oil industry the SEG-Y format is used to store \n\nand share seismic data (Yilmaz, 2001). \n\nIn the quality control phase, the traces that are recognized by the operator as anomalous (noisy \n\nor inverted polarity) are eliminated so as not to compromise the remaining data. A basic filter is \n\nalso applied to eliminate the noise characteristic of low frequencies caused by bad atmospheric \n\nconditions or undesired streamer movements, for example, cable feathering (Yilmaz, 2001). \n\nThe correction of spherical divergence is a function that applies some gain to compensate for the \n\nloss of amplitude of the seismic energy as it moves away from the source inside the Earth, by \n\nincreasing the gain of the signal with increasing distance. This correction must be used when \n\nconsidering large distances, for small distances requires some care in their use as it can greatly \n\nincrease noise instead of improving data.  \n\nAfter the data is corrected, it is ready for the definition of the acquisition geometry in the field, \n\npositioning the sources and receivers in the trace headers. This step is the one of the most \n\nimportant phases of the processing, and may lead to many problems if a wrong definition of \n\nparameters is used. \n\nThe recorded seismic trace is a convolution of the seismic wavelet with the reflection coefficient \n\nseries which result from the contrasting properties (density and seismic velocity) of the different \n\nrock layers, where the seismic rays pass through. \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n \n\nThe deconvolution it is an inverse filtering technique used to compress an oscillatory (long) source \n\nwaveform, often seen on marine data, into a spike (unit-impulse function), as close as possible. \n\nThis technique allows eliminating some noise that was convolved during the acquisition, for \n\ninstance, the source signature and derived multiples, obtaining the reflection coefficient series of \n\nthe geological formations, once the shape of the wavelet is made closer to a peak of energy. The \n\ngreat advantage of deconvolution is to increase the vertical resolution by compressing the \n\nwavelet without compromising the frequency content. This procedure leads to a significant \n\nimprovement of the seismic profile but can also increase high frequency noise and may require \n\nsubsequent filtering (Yilmaz, 2001). \n\nThe velocity analysis is performed on selected CMP gathers (Figure 10) or group of gathers (Super \n\nGathers). The velocity model is then used to correct the NMO of the CMP gathers and afterwards \n\nin migration.  \n\n \n\nFigure 10. Common mid-point (CMP) reflection profiling. A set of rays from different shots (Si) to detectors (Di) \n\nreflected off a common depth point (CDP) on a horizontal reflector (Kearey et al.,2002). \n \n\nThe NMO correction is applied to correct differences in distance between the source and the \n\nreceiver inside the same CMP\u2019s family (Figure 11 A), in a non-dipping reflector, assuming that the \n\npropagation distance as a function of time describes a hyperbolic trajectory; the goal of NMO \n\ncorrection is to remove the curvature of this reflection hyperbola (Yilmaz, 2001). \n\nAfter the NMO correction (Figure 11 B) of the CMP gather, the next step of the typical processing \n\nflow is the CMP Stacking (this is possible because, the data came from multi-channel seismic \n\nacquisition with multiple CMP coverage). The Stack (Figure 11 C) consists of summing the traces \n\nwhich belong to the same CMP location into just one trace at normal incidence, after NMO \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n \n\ncorrection. This process will increase the signal-to-noise ratio and attenuate noise such as \n\nmultiples and ground roll, because the reflected signal and coherent noise usually have different \n\nstacking velocities (Yilmaz, 2001). \n\n \n\nFigure 11 . A) Sorted CMP gathers; every Si-Ri that corresponds to the same reflection point; B) CMP gather after \n\nexecuting the NMO corrections; C) Stacked trace with a better signal (from http://www.gsj.go.jp, modified by Ribeiro, \n\n2011). \n \n\nThe standard processing flow usually finishes with a migration. This process moves the seismic \n\nreflectors to their correct position in space, if the realistic velocity model is calculated. The \n\nmigration process will move the dipping events into their supposedly true subsurface positions, \n\ncollapse the diffractions, increase the spatial resolution and correct amplitudes for geometric \n\nfocusing effects (Yilmaz, 2001). This process can be applied after (post-stack migration) or before \n\nthe stack (pre-stack migration).  \n\nThe pre-stack migration it is a heavy computational process and takes a long time to complete. \n\nThe algorithm is applied trace to trace at each CMP location, instead of being applied to the \n\nstacked data (Yilmaz, 2001). The pre-stack migration produces an image of the subsurface with \n\nsuperior quality, allowing the user a better interpretation of the area under study. \n\nThe main differences between the 2D seismic data processing and 3D seismic data processing are: \n\nquality control, statics correction, velocity analysis, migration and the way in which reflective \n\npoints are considered for seismic processing purposes. All the processing steps (either in 2D \n\nseismic data processing or 3D seismic data processing) should be quality controlled through the \n\nseismic processing job to ensure that the quality of the data is not diminishing during the seismic \n\ndata processing. Cable feathering is caused by cross currents, and in marine 3-D surveys can result \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n \n\nin travel time deviations from a single hyperbolic moveout within a common-cell gather (Yilmaz, \n\n2001). \n\nAs described previously, the 2D seismic processing, requires first sorting the recorded data into \n\ncommon midpoint gathers, and in a similar form, the processing of 3D seismic data requires \n\nBinning the recorded the traces into common cell gathers (bins) to create common-cell stacks.  A \n\ncommon-cell gather coincides with a CMP gather for swath shooting. For marine surveys, the \n\ntypical cell sizes are 12.5 \u00d7 25 m (Yilmaz, 2001). \n\nFor a surface subdivided by a grid of lines, the area between adjacent lines is called a Bin. The \n\ntraces which fall within a bin are assumed to lie at the bin centre, which is also called a node or \n\ngrid cell. The Binning is sorting traces into the appropriate bin (Sheriff, 2002). \n\nThe traces are assigned to specific bins according to the midpoint (Middle Point) between \n\nthe source and the receiver (Figure 12). Bins are commonly assigned according to common \n\nmidpoint (CMP), but more sophisticated seismic processing allows for other types of Binning. \n\nTraces within a bin are stacked to generate the output trace for that bin. Data quality depends in \n\npart on the number of traces per bin, or the fold. \n\n \n\nFigure 12. Schematic image about what contains a bin. \n \n\nConventional 3-D recording geometries often complicate the process of stacking the data in a \n\ncommon-cell gather. After stacking, the 3-D data volume is migrated. Before migration, the data \n\nsometimes needs to be trace-interpolated along the crossline direction to avoid spatial aliasing \n\n(Yilmaz, 2001). The migrated 3-D data volume then is available to the interpreter as vertical \n\nsections in both the inline and crossline directions and as horizontal sections. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms/m/midpoint.aspx\nhttp://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms/s/source.aspx\nhttp://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms/r/receiver.aspx\nhttp://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms/c/common_midpoint.aspx\nhttp://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms/c/common_midpoint.aspx\nhttp://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms/s/seismic_processing.aspx\n\n\n \n\n18 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n \n\n3. The Hornsea Offshore Windfarm Project \n\nOne - 3D UHRS Survey \u2013 Case Study  \n\nAs referred to in Chapter 1, the study area is located in the southern North Sea. In order to make \n\nthe reader first acquainted with the geological setting of the seismic survey, this Chapter starts \n\nwith a brief summary of the geological setting of the study area and its geological evolution. This \n\nis followed by a description of the seismic survey details and the presentation of some images of \n\nthe resulting seismic block, in which the main seismic horizons are interpreted. \n\n \n\n3.1 Geological Framework of the Southern North Sea \n\nHans Stille, in 1924, divided the European continent into four major domains according to the \n\ntime of the orogenic stabilization, based on the last orogeny that affected them: the Eo-Europe \n\n(Precambrian Europe), the Paleo-Europe (Caledonian Europe), the Meso-Europe (Variscan Europe) \n\nand the Neo-Europe (Alpine Europe). The Southern North Sea is inserted on Paleo-Europe, \n\nwithout significant deformation since the end of the lower Paleozoic (Figure 13). \n\nThe Southern North Sea Basin has a complicated and vast history of geological events, namely \n\nbasinal subsidence. The basinal subsidence has been interrupted by distinct episodes of uplift and \n\nwidespread erosion.  \n\n \n\nFigure 13. Main tectonic units of Europe, based on Stille (1924) and modified by Ribeiro et al., 1979. \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n \n\n3.1.1 Paleozoic (541 -252.1 Million years ago)  \n\nThroughout most of the southern North Sea the lower Paleozoic sediments intruded by granite \n\nplutons and mildly deformed during the Caledonian Orogeny of Late Silurian to Early Devonian \n\napproximately 420 - 390 million years ago (Balson et al., 2001; Cameron et al., 1992). \n\nThe predominantly WNW and NW trends of the faults within the Late Paleozoic, Mesozoic and \n\nCenozoic sequences may be hereditary from the structure of the fundamental Lower Paleozoic \n\nbasement (Balson et al.., 2001). \n\nFollowing the Caledonian uplift, most of the Southern North Sea remained an area of erosion \n\nunder the sea about 410-360 million years (Devonian). Crustal extension started early in the \n\nCarboniferous approximately 360 million years ago, which allowed the deposition of deltaic \n\nsediments within the graben areas (Cameron et al., 1992). \n\nSome of the granite batholiths inferred from their geophysical signatures may lie beneath early \n\nCarboniferous horsts (Cameron et al., 1992), though expressively different interpretations exist \n\nfor the locations of the syn-rift blocks and basins (Collinson et al., 1993; Besley, 1998). The rifting \n\nhad effectively ceased and a phase of thermal subsidence had commenced, around 325 million \n\nyears ago (Balson et al., 2001). \n\nDuring the Variscan Orogeny about 300-290 million years ago, the Carboniferous rocks were \n\nmoderately folded and faulted. About 310 - 270 million years ago, a differential Late \n\nCarboniferous to Early Permian regional uplift led to the erosion of more than 1500 m of \n\nCarboniferous strata from parts of the Southern North Sea Basin (Balson et al., 2001). \n\nThe southern North Sea Basin, after the Variscan Orogeny, began to subside again in the Permian \n\ntimes, and more than 2700 m of Permo-Triassic levels, covering an age range of around 290-210 \n\nmillion years were deposited, including red beds and a thick, cyclical, evaporite succession (Ziegler, \n\n1975; Balson et al., 2001). \n\n \n\n3.1.2 Mesozoic (252.1-66.0 Million years ago)  \n\nThe Late Triassic and Early Jurassic subsidence in the Sole Pit Basin was related to the reactivation \n\nof its Variscan basement faults (Glennie and Boegner, 1981). These tectonic movements \n\ngenerated the earliest mid-Triassic halokinesis of the Upper Permian salts (Balson et al., 2001). \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n \n\nThe marine conditions were then re-established in the southern North Sea at the end of the \n\nTriassic. Then, during early\u2013mid Jurassic times, differential subsidence of the Sole Pit Basin was \n\naccentuated by the extensional faults along the western margin. It is these faults that account for \n\nthe major thickness of the Lower and Middle Jurassic sediments between the East Midlands Shelf \n\nand the Sole Pit Basin (Balson et al., 2001). \n\nIn the Middle Jurassic, widespread domal uplift centreed in the central North Sea and resulted in \n\nan erosional unconformity. More than 1000 m of Jurassic and Triassic strata were eroded from \n\nthe Cleaver Bank High at this time (Glennie, 1986). During the Late Jurassic, there was a \n\nwidespread pulse of diapirism (Glennie and Underhill, 1998; Balson et al., 2001). \n\nLower Cretaceous sediments are typically less than 200 m thick, but reach up to 1000 m in local \n\nzones of growth faulting, associated with sinistral fault movement (Kirby and Swallow, 1987). \n\nDuring the Late Cretaceous, the Cleaver Bank High became established as the main depocentre \n\nand accumulated more than 1000 m of Upper Cretaceous chalk (Balson et al., 2001).  \n\nThe Upper Cretaceous chalk formations include cemented carbonate platforms of chalk crop at \n\nseabed. Chalk is an important aquifer in the onshore and offshore margins of the southern North \n\nSea where it covers large areas (Balson et al., 2001). \n\n \n\n3.1.3 Cenozoic (66.0 -0.0 Million years ago)  \n\nThe Sole Pit Basin and the Cleveland Basin are two examples of basins from NW Europe that have \n\nbeen affected by basin inversion during, or at the end of, the Late Cretaceous. This basin has been \n\nattributed to strike-slip reactivations of basement faults (Glennie and Boegner, 1981;  Balson et al., \n\n2001). \n\nCenozoic subsidence in the North Sea has been controlled by broad synclinal down warping \n\ntowards a depositional axis that extends from the Viking Graben, through the Central Graben in \n\nthe direction of the Netherlands (Balson et al., 2001).During the Cenozoic, the basin was lightly \n\ndeformed by tectonic inversion and basin-margin uplift driven by intraplate compression, \n\nresulting from the interplay between the opening of the NE Atlantic Ocean and the Alpine \n\norogeny (Caston, 1977; Graham et al., 2011). \n\nDuring Oligocene to Miocene times, many of the basement faults in the Southern North Sea were \n\nreactivated by dextral strike-slip (Glennie and Boegner, 1981), which triggered further major \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n \n\nhalokinesis. Most of the salt pillows north of 54\no\n north were initiated in mid-Cenozoic times, and \n\nGlennie (1986) connected contemporaneous inversion of the Sole Pit Basin to Alpine movements. \n\nThere are very few Miocene sediments and Pliocene deposits too (Balson et al., 2001). Since the \n\nMid-Cenozoic, up to 3000 m of Oligocene to Holocene sediment has accumulated in the central \n\ngraben region, including, locally, more than 800 m of Quaternary sediment (Caston, 1977; Graham \n\net al., 2011).  \n\nRapid subsidence became more widespread early in the Quaternary resulting in the preservation \n\nof more than 600 m of Pleistocene progradational delta deposits and glaciogenic deposits (Balson \n\net al., 2001). \n\nThe Quaternary climatic change was a major event in the recent history and is preserved in the \n\nsedimentary record of the southern North Sea; during the colder periods it exhibited mean annual \n\nair temperatures well below zero degrees Celsius (Plant et al., 2003). The major effects of this \n\nevent are erosion and deposition of material over large parts of the continents and surrounding \n\nseas, modification of the river systems, creation of multiple small bodies of water, major changes \n\nin sea level and isostatic adjustment of the crust (Long et al., 1988). This has affected the type of \n\ndeposits available to be preserved on the geological record and their properties.  \n\nUnfortunately, most terrestrial evidence for most of some 25 such glacial cycles, recognized in \n\nmarine sediments, has been destroyed by subsequent events. The surviving geomorphological \n\nand stratigraphically record is usually restricted to deposits of the main glacial events, which are \n\nthe Elsterian, the Saalian and the Weichselian glaciations (Figure 14; Long et al., 1988).  \n\nThe Quaternary of the British sector of the North Sea has been divided into several groups, as \n\ndescribed below. \n\n \n\nCrag Group \n\nThe base of quaternary in British sector of the North Sea is now taken at the top of the Red Crag \n\nFormation, an Upper Pliocene formation consisting of shell-bearing glauconitic sediment, which \n\noccurs at or near bed off the coast of East Anglia (Long et al., 1988; Stoker et al., 2011). The Red \n\nCrag Formation is the only offshore formation of the Crag Group. This formation is a high-energy \n\nshallow-marine glauconitic deposit, and therefore lithologically like to the onshore formation with \n\nthe same geological time.  \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n \n\nThe Red Crag Formation might range in age from Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene, around to \n\n3.2\u20132.4 Ma, based on the presence of the planktonic foraminiferid (Funnell, 1988).  It is rests with \n\nmarked unconformity on Palaeogene or Neogene formations and is unconformably overlain by \n\ndeposits of the Southern North Sea Deltaic Group (Cameron et al., 1992; Stoker et al., 2011). \n\n \n\nFigure 14. Map of the North Europe, showing the maximum extension of the European ice sheets: the Elsterian, the \n\nSaalian and the Weichselian glaciations (from Anderson and Borns, 1997). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n \n\nSouthern North Sea Deltaic Group \n\nIn the British sector (Figure 16), the Lower to early middle Pleistocene succession displays seismic \n\nfacies that can relate to a specific environment, a delta complex (Long et al., 1988). The Southern \n\nNorth Sea Deltaic Group is defined essentially nine constituent formations: the Westkapelle \n\nGround, Crane, Smith\u2019s Knoll, Ijmuiden Ground, Winterton Shoal, Markham\u2019s Hole, Outer Silver Pit, \n\nAurora and Batavier formations.  These formations succeed each other northwards as the delta \n\nprograde into the basin. The base of the Southern North Sea Deltaic Group is around Early \n\nPleistocene, and mostly overlies the Red Crag Formation, though the latter may be partly \n\ncorrelated with the Westkapelle Ground Formation (Stoker et al., 2011). \n\nThe term Southern North Sea Deltaic Group is proposed for a thick succession of marine deltaic \n\nformations, including delta front and prodelta deposits (apart from the Crane Formation), formed \n\nby sediments derived from south eastern England and the Netherlands that are preserved in the \n\nSouthern North Sea (Stoker et al., 2011). \n\nThe deltaic and pro-deltaic sediments from this group are associated with the development of the \n\nsouthern North Sea delta, which has been compared in size to the largest modern delta \n\ncomplexes in the world (Ekman and Scourse, 1993), and was accountable for the majority of non-\n\nglacial deposition during the Early to Mid-Pleistocene in the southern and central North Sea \n\n(Cameron et al., 1992; Graham et al., 2011; Stoker et al., 2011). \n\nThe union of the two delta fronts occurred in earliest Beestonian (Eburonian) times, when the \n\ndirection of advance swung northwards (Cameron et al., 1992; Stoker et al., 2011; Long et al., \n\n2011). The top deltaic group is diachronous with the Yarmouth Roads Formation, which is here \n\nassigned to the Dunwich Group (Cameron et al., 1992; Stoker et al., 2011; Long et al., 2011). \n\n \n\nDunwich Group \n\nThe Yarmouth Roads Formation is the only offshore formation to be assigned to the Dunwich \n\nGroup, which has been correlated in part with the Sudbury Formation of the Kesgrave Catchment \n\nSubgroup in East Anglia (onshore). The base is highly diachronous being oldest \n\n(Beestonian/Waalian) in the south, and becoming less easily definable towards the centre of the \n\nbasin, where it is locally coeval with the fully marine formations of the Southern North Sea Deltaic \n\nGroup. The formation was deposited prior to the Anglian (MIS?12) and is unconformably overlain \n\nby the California Glacigenic Group (Cameron and Holmes, 1999; Stoker et al., 2011). \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n \n\nCalifornia Glacigenic Group \n\nGenerally, glacier related deposits are preserved in the sedimentary record of the southern North \n\nSea by moraine, glaciofluvial and glaciolacustrine deposits from the Elsterian, Saalian and \n\nWeichselian glacial periods (Figure 14). At these times, the British and Fennoscandian ice sheets \n\ncovered certain amounts of the area, contributing to the erosion, supply of sediments and infill of \n\nthis basin (Stoker et al., 2011; Long et al., 2011). \n\nThe California Glacigenic Group consists essentially in 16 formations. The base of this group is \n\nmarked by the Swarte Bank Formation. The Swarte Bank Formation is located in the base of \n\nburied valleys in the southern North Sea Basin, south of 55\u00b0N (Davies et al., 2011). During the \n\nElsterian glacial period (MIS 12), full glacial conditions led to the erosion and infilling of a major \n\nsystem of tunnel valleys, up to 12 km wide and 400 m deep, in the southern North Sea Basin \n\n(Cameron et al., 1987). \n\nThe infilling of the valleys commenced with stiff glacial and glaciofluvial sand, overlain by \n\nglaciolacustrine muds and culminating with marine interglacial sediments of the Sand Hole and \n\nEgmond Ground formations. The age of the infilling deposits therefore is from late Anglian to \n\nearliest Hoxnian (Stoker et al., 2011). \n\nThe Cleaver Bank and Tea Kettle Hole formations happen near to the centre of the southern \n\nNorth Sea, they are both of Wolstonian age (Figure 15). The Cleaver Bank Formation is a partly \n\nmarine proglacial diamicton with clasts derived from the east (Cameron et al., 1992), but also \n\nincludes glaciolacustrine and glaciofluvial facies. The Tea Kettle Hole Formation is broadly \n\ncontemporaneous with the Cleaver Bank Formation, and consists of discontinuous deposits of \n\nperiglacial aeolian sands. These units are overlain by the interglacial Eem Formation (Stoker et al., \n\n2011). \n\nThe earliest set of glacigenic units consists of seven formations: the Well Ground, Bolders Bank, \n\nDogger Bank, Botney Cut, Twente, Sunderland Ground and Hirundo formations, which are all \n\nDevensian. Periglacial, fluvial deposits comprise the Well Ground Formation.  \n\nClimatic deterioration towards fully glacial conditions caused regional sea level in the North Sea to \n\nfall to at least 110 m below present by late Weicheselian glacial period. A blanket deposit of \n\nWeichselian is the Boulders Bank Formation. This formation is a widespread deposit of diamicton \n\nbelieved to have been deposited by a lobe of ice which moved down the east coast of England \n\n(Cameron et al., 1987).  \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n \n\nThe Bolders Bank Formation (Figure 16) interfingers with proglacial sediments of the Dogger Bank \n\nFormation. Previous micromorphological investigation of the Bolders Bank Formation indicated \n\ngenesis as a subglacial till (Carr et al., 2000), reflecting an ice sheet extending across the southern \n\nNorth Sea (Davies et al., 2011). Subglacial valleys were incised into older Pleistocene sediments \n\nand have partially been infilled by the diamictons of the Botney Cut Formation (Stoker et al., \n\n2011). \n\nThe Twente Formation represents periglacial wind-blown sands deposited near the ice margin. \n\nLate-stage infilling of troughs as the ice retreated westwards occurred with the glaciolacustrine to \n\nglaciomarine sediments of the Sunderland Ground and Hirundo formations (Stoker et al., 2011). \n\nAs already mentioned, there are a few formations that corresponds some marine interglacial units. \n\nThese units are represented by six constituent formations, namely, the Sand Hole and Egmond \n\nGround formations are Hoxnian (Holsteinian interglacial period); the Eem and Brown Bank \n\nformations are Ipswichian to Early Devensian; and the Elbow and Southern Bight formations are \n\nHolocene (Stoker et al., 2011). \n\nThe Sand Hole Formation is confined to an area around the modern Inner Silver Pit. In contrast, \n\nthe Egmond Ground Formation occurs widely and may infill the uppermost portions of Anglian \n\nsubglacial valleys overlying the Swarte Bank or earlier deltaic formations such as those of the \n\nDunwich Group. A stratigraphical break due to the fall in sea level during Wolstonian times \n\nseparates these formations from those of the next marine incursion during Ipswichian times \n\n(Stoker et al., 2011). \n\nThe marine sediments of the Eem Formation (Eemian interglacial period) have been identified at \n\nseveral sites and are made of intertidal and shallow marine sands and clays. This formation rests \n\nunconformably on the Egmond Ground Formation and is overlain by a marginal marine deposit, \n\nthe Brown Bank Formation, which may have been deposited as sea levels fell during Early \n\nDevensian times equivalent to MIS?4 (Cameron and Holmes, 1999). A further stratigraphical break \n\nseparates these formations from the deposits of the postglacial return of marine conditions into \n\nthe southern North Sea (Stoker et al., 2011). \n\nFinally, the earliest Holocene brackish-marine incursion into the southern North Sea may have \n\noccurred as early as 10 ka BP (Eisma et al., 1981). The earliest Holocene is characterized by the \n\nElbow Formation; this formation was deposited in shallow water intertidal or coastal \n\nenvironments. \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 15. Summary of the Quaternary lithostratigraphical framework for the UKCS with relationships of groups to \n\nQuaternary stages, suggested correlation with Marine Isotope Stages (MIS), and correlation with onshore framework \n\n(modified by Stoker et al., 2011). \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n \n\nAs fully open marine conditions became established the Elbow Formation was overlain \n\nunconformably by the deposits of the Southern Bight Formation, which contains a number of \n\ndiachronous members. These members include transgressive deposits that formed around 8000 \n\nBP (Eisma et al., 1981; Long et al., 1988) and the modern mobile marine sediments, such as those \n\nfound within sandwaves or sandbanks in the southern North Sea (Stoker et al., 2011). \n\n \n\nFigure 16.

The 3D seismic blocks had some problems during the acquisition, \n\nnamely the gaps in the seismic (Figure 18). A possible solution to solve the problem it is the Flex \n\nBinning method which will be explained in the following sub-chapters since its application is one \n\nof the main goals of this thesis.  \n\n \n\n \n\n                            \n\nFigure 18.

Also, \n\nthe numerous erosional surfaces present are likely to be related with glaciers and sea level \n\nchanges (Figure 19 and Figure 20). \n\n.        \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 19.

Data can be converted to SEG-Y or \n\nSEG-D format immediately after the end of the line. In a typical 3D acquisition situation, for each \n\ntrace there exist at least 26 trace headers and normally 5 traces are acquired per second with 96 \n\nchannels in total (4 streamers x 24 channels); after one minute of acquisition there are 28800 \n\ntraces. Therefore, in an hour of acquisition there are 1728000 traces and 10368000 trace headers \n\ntotal.  \n\nThe B27H27 seismic block took approximately 41 hours to be acquired and has 74059656 traces \n\nand 1925551056 headers. This seismic block is not the largest that Geosurveys has acquired, but it \n\nis possible already to see that these acquisitions involve a very large volume of traces as well as \n\ntrace headers. The SEG Y files in this type of seismic datasets therefore contain a large number of \n\ntraces; there are more traces than the expected in a normal dataset, which leads to software \n\nlimitations, as SPW is not prepared for these data sizes yet. Therefore, the high dimensions of \n\ntraces and headers on the dataset can be a problem, because they influence the performance of \n\nthe SPW program (software limit), the computer hardware limits, and time for efficient processing. \n\n1 \n\n3 \n\n2 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n \n\n4.  Flex Binning Implementation in SPW \n\nIn this Chapter, after a brief explanation about Flex Binning and a description of the way in which \n\nit was originally implemented in SPW, the tests of its application to 3D UHRS data are described, \n\ntogether with the problems found and the solutions adopted. \n\n \n\n4.1 What is Flex Binning? \n\nDue to sea conditions, which often cause cable feathering, the majority of 3D marine seismic \n\nsurveys do not have a regular sampling of offsets. This results in fold variation, mainly for larger \n\noffsets, or even in areas with no data at all, causing severe impacts in several steps of the data \n\nprocessing such as velocity analysis, multiple attenuation, stacking and migration. Surveys which \n\nhave this common problem require the insertion of the Flex Binning method into the workflow, \n\nwhich is the aim of this work.  \n\nThe Flex Binning process attempts to maintain a uniform CDP fold and offset distribution \n\nthroughout the surveyed area. In order to make the distribution of offsets more uniform, the bins \n\nare extended by a percentage of their size (GeoSurveys, 2016). This extension can be made in \n\nboth in-line and cross-line directions. If no trace is found within the original bin then a trace inside \n\nthe extended bin is used. If several traces are found in the neighboring bins, usually the selected \n\nthe trace is the one nearer to the bin centre. Figure 21 shows the process of bin expansion.  \n\n \n\nFigure 21. Bin expansion diagram. See text for explanation. \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n \n\nIn Figure 21, the bin A is expanded for a near offset trace with a relatively small expansion. The \n\nbin B is searching for traces with a larger offset, i.e. with a larger bin expansion, and gets three \n\nresults; the trace closest to the bin centre is the one that is borrowed. Bin C already has a far \n\noffset trace and no bin extension is needed. The red trace (near-offset trace) will end up being \n\nused by both bin A and D. \n\nThere are other alternative solutions, instead using the Flex Binning, namely the Regularization \n\nand Interpolation. In this work, the Flex Binning method will be used. \n\n \n\n4.2 The SPW Flex Binning \n\nAs stated above, one of the main objectives of this thesis was to test the application of the \n\navailable Flex Binning routines in the SPW software (from Parallel Geoscience) to Ultra High \n\nResolution 3D seismic Datasets commonly acquired by Geosurveys and to investigate how to \n\nmake it efficient enough so that it can be applied in the field, just after the data acquisition to fill \n\nidentified cover gaps before preliminary field processing. This work was carried out in close \n\ncollaboration with the Parallel Geoscience software development team, so that when problems \n\nwere identified, solutions could be sought, implemented and new tests performed for checking \n\nthe proposed solutions. For this purpose, two seismic datasets were used: (1) a medium size \n\ndataset (209 GB) and a large volume dataset (462 GB). The first one was used to detect any \n\nsoftware bugs and problems before testing the software in a large dataset. After most of the code \n\nproblems were solved, it was used the largest dataset acquired in the survey area (751 GB). \n\nIn SPW, the Flex Binning Processing Step consists of 2 main flows: (a) the CMP Binning flow, \n\ndescribed in Section 4.2.2 and (b) the Bin Fold Limit flow, described in Section 4.2.3.  \n\n \n\n4.2.1 Data input \n\nBefore running the Flex Binning flow, just after acquisition, it is fundamental to verify first the \n\ncontents in the various header positions in the SEG-Y input file, so as to create a SEG-Y format \n\ntemplate (Figure 22) in SPW, which will be used to build the index file. SPW already has a SEG-Y \n\nstandard format template, but it is often necessary to change some header values stored in non-\n\nstandard positions. This was the case for the medium size dataset used in this work, because it \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n \n\nwas retrieved after preliminary processing with the RadEx Pro software, which changed the byte \n\nlocations of the inline and crossline, CMP Easting and CMP northing (these had to be corrected \n\nand are highlighted by the red rectangles in Figure 22) The medium size dataset has 7978 inlines \n\nand 117 crosslines.  \n\nIn a new phase of the tests, it was used larger input file which came directly from the seismic data \n\nacquisition (B27H27 seismic block with 462 GB). This large size dataset has 771366 number of \n\nrecords, which corresponds to the number of shots; 192 traces per record which corresponds to \n\nthe number of channels / receivers for each shot - since there are two seismic sources, 96 \n\nchannels*2 sources=192; 1500 the samples per trace; and 0.100 ms the sample interval. \n\n                                   \n\n \n\nFigure 22.  SEG-Y Template in SPW for the medium size seismic dataset, after correction of the header values to their \n\nstandard byte location, since these had been swapped in the output SEG-Y file from the RadEx Pro software. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.2 CMP Binning Flow with Flex Binning \n\nThe CMP Binning process in SPW assigns CMP line and location numbers according to user \n\nspecified coordinate parameters. If a 2D survey is specified, the user is prompted to define the \n\nline. If a 3D survey is specified, the user will be prompted to define the grid. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n \n\nThe option of Flex Binning allows each bin to contain more traces, by increasing the effective size \n\nof each bin and by including traces which fall into neighboring bins. The amount of Flex can also \n\nbe proportional to the trace offset. The Flex traces may be added immediately to the output data \n\nflow, or else their locations can be written into a Flex file. This option allows stacking the Flex \n\ntraces without extra sorting.  \n\nThe CMP Binning flow is composed of an Input file (seismic data in any sort order), the CMP \n\nBinning processing step, a CMP Flex Locations card and an Output file with any sort order (Figure \n\n23). \n\n \n\nFigure 23. Example CMP Binning Flowchart  \n \n\n \n\nInput File \n\nThe input seismic file for the first tests with the medium size dataset after corrections to the \n\nheader values is shown in Figure 24, where we can observe: the number of records (363244), \n\nwhich corresponds to the number of shots; the traces per record (192) which corresponds to the \n\nnumber of channels / receivers for each shot - since there are two seismic sources, 96 channels*2 \n\nsources=192; the number of traces (33556726); the samples per trace (1500); and the sample \n\ninterval (0.1000ms). \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 24. SEG Y Input for CMP Binning flow with the medium size dataset. \n\n \n\nCMP Binning Processing Step \n\nTo implement the CMP Binning step, it is necessary to fill in the parameters inside the CMP \n\nBinning window shown in Figure 25. The parameters are: grid definition, coordinate definition, \n\nsurvey dimensions, project updates, Binning type specification, Flex Binning specification and \n\ninput header coordinates. The coordinates of the grid (3D survey area) are inserted by defining \n\nthree of its corners, which are: \n\n? Corner 1 Easting: Enter the easting (x) coordinate of the first corner of the survey. \n\n? Corner 1 Northing: Enter the northing (y) coordinate of the first corner of the survey. \n\n? Corner 2 Easting: Enter the easting (x) coordinate of the second corner of the survey. \n\n? Corner 2 Northing: Enter the northing (y) coordinate of the second corner of the survey \n\n? Corner 3 Easting: Enter the easting (x) coordinate of the third corner of the survey. \n\n? Corner 3 Northing: Enter the northing (y) coordinate of the third corner of the survey. \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 25. Step parameters for the CMP Binning window \n\n \n\nFor the grid definition, it is essential also to insert: \n\n? the Inline bin size: Enter the size in distance units of the inline side of each bin.  \n\n? the Crossline bin size: Enter the size in distance units of the crossline side of each bin. \n\n? the First inline number: Enter the first inline number. This line number is assigned to all \n\nthe bins along the side of the survey from corner 1 to corner 2.  \n\n? the Inline increment: Enter the increment in line numbers between adjacent CMP lines.  \n\n? First crossline number: Enter the first crossline number. This location number is assigned \n\nto all the bins along the side of the survey from corner 1 to corner 3.  \n\n? the Crossline increment: Enter the increment in locations between adjacent CMP \n\nlocations. \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n \n\nThe coordinate definition, specifies whether the corner points define the bin centres or corners, \n\nexplicitly: \n\n? Corner points define bin centres: Select to specify that corner points define bin centres. It \n\nis used this coordinate definition (Figure 26).  \n\n? Corner points define bin corners: Select to specify that corner points define bin corners.  \n\n \n\nFigure 26. Coordinate definition in SPW. \n\n \n\nThe survey dimensions need also to be specified both for 2D and 3D, namely: \n\n? 2D: Select to specify 2D line survey dimensions.  \n\n? 3D: Select to specify 3D grid survey dimensions (the case of this work). \n\n?  \n\nIn SPW it is possible to make updates from the project: \n\n? Update from project: Select to update from the project.  \n\n? Update project: Select to update the project. \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n \n\n The Binning type specification, can be as follows: \n\n? No Flex Binning: Select standard Binning, with no extra traces added.  \n\n? Output Flex traces directly: Select to add Flex traces to the output binned traces.  \n\n? Output Flex locations to a Flex file: Select to add the locations of Flex traces to an \n\nadditional output Flex file. This is the way to get an output Flex location that is going to be \n\nused for Flex data, in Bin Fold Limit. \n\nThe input header coordinates were implemented when SPW version 2 was released and were \n\nimproved in version 3. With the input header coordinates it is possible to specify whether the \n\nHeader coordinates of the input are Source and Receiver XYs or CMP XYs and Offset: \n\n? Source and Receiver XYs: Select to specify that the trace midpoint position and trace \n\noffset will both be calculated from the Source Easting and Northing and the Receiver \n\nEasting and Northing trace headers. \n\n? CMP XYs and Offset: Select to specify that trace midpoint position will be taken from the \n\ntrace headers CMP Easting and CMP Northing, and the offset will be taken from the offset \n\nheader. \n\nThe Flex Binning specification (Figure 27) allows choosing the standard Binning or the type of Flex \n\nBinning required: \n\n? Inline % bin Flex: Specify the percentage increase of each bin size in the inline direction to \n\ninclude extra \u2018Flex\u2019 traces. \n\n? Crossline % bin Flex: Specify the percentage increase of each bin size in the crossline \n\ndirection to include extra \u2018Flex\u2019 traces. \n\n? Inline % Offset Flex: Specify the increase of each bin size as the percentage increase of \n\nthe trace inline offsets. \n\n? Crossline % Offset Flex: Specify the increase of each bin size as the percentage increase of \n\nthe trace crossline offsets. \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 27. Diagram representing how % Flex works on the data. \n\nThe Flex Binnig is done in the CMP domain. The mid-point of every trace from a shot to a receiver \n\nis assigned to the CMP bin which contains that mid-point.  The bins making up the survey area are \n\nall rectangular. With Flex Binning, each bin is larger than the standard non-Flex bin size. A 20 % -\n\n20 % bin Flex means that the length of each bin (in-line size) and the width of each bin (cross-line \n\nsize) are 20% longer each than the standard bin length and width. \n\nTherefore, if the standard bin size is 1m X 1m, 100% Flex would be taken as meaning the Flex bin \n\nsize is 2m X 2m (i.e. increased by 100%). The distance to each of the bin boundary lines from the \n\nbin centre, would have increased from 0.5m to 1m. Each trace in this case can be expected to land \n\nin four different bins \u2013 one being its standard nearest non-Flex bin, and the other three in \n\nneighboring Flex-bins. This of course depends on whether the trace mid-point falls in the centre or \n\nnear the edge of the survey.  In the case of a % Flex in each direction which is not a multiple of \n\n100%, or if the in-line and cross-line Flex %s are different, the number of Flex bins that a trace falls \n\ninto will vary depending on its exact location. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n \n\nOutput File \n\nThe output CMP binned dataset will contain only the original traces which fall within the survey \n\narea if you set to drop out dead traces and already had the grid implemented according to the \n\nparameters established by CMP Binning card. It won\u2019t contain Flex traces. The output seismic file \n\nfrom the CMP Binning flow appears with trace headers Inline and Crossline, in the same position \n\nof the CMP Line Location and CMP Location, respectively. \n\n \n\nCMP Flex Location Output Card (Flex Table)  \n\nThe Flex table is filled in by the Flex locations from the 3D dataset. Although it was suggested that \n\nthis output file should be in a text format, this has not yet been accomplished by the software \n\ndevelopment team and the output Flex Table is still at present in an image format. Thanks to \n\nsome of the suggestions proposed it is nevertheless now possible to open the CMP Flex Locations \n\ndialog box and see how the file has been filled in (Figure 28). It is also now possible to save the \n\nFlex file location in a Flex File format, but again not yet in a table format.  \n\nThe Flex table parameters that can be checked are: \n\n? Currents Records: Lowest and highest input trace numbers (ID), and the ranges of CMP \n\nlines and locations (first and the last CMP lines/ CMP locations) written should be stored \n\nin the file header.  \n\n? Flex Binning Specification: Write the specification that was stable before in the CMP \n\nBinning step (Inline % bin Flex, Crossline % bin Flex, Inline % Offset Flex and Crossline % \n\nOffset Flex). \n\n \n\nTwo further options that were requested and are now available in the latest software version, are: \n\n?  \u201cAppend to existing dataset\u201d: to continue adding Flex locations to the specified Flex file. \n\nOtherwise if the specified Flex file exists it will be renamed with the addition of \n\nsuffix\u2019_copy\u2019 and a new file of the specified name opened. \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n \n\n? \u201cScan File\u201d: to read through the file and check that the reported record statistics are \n\ncorrect. Warning: for large files this process can take considerable time. \n\nWhen the CMP Binning flowchart is run, the CMP Flex Location cart is filled with Current Records \n\nand Flex Binning Specification.  \n\n \n\nFigure 28. CMP Flex Location dialog window. \n\n \n\n4.2.3 Bin Fold Limit Flow   \n\nThe Bin Fold Limit Flow (Figure 29) adds extra Flex traces to the input binned data from an input \n\nFlex table. The Flex traces are selected from the Flex table locations as specified by the Bin Fold \n\nLimit parameters. The output is the 3D Seismic data sorted by CMP Line and CMP Location. The \n\ninput parameters are: \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n \n\n1) 3D Seismic data sorted by CMP Line and CMP Location, with CMP Location as the record \n\nkey (mandatory). \n\n2) A Flex Table generated as the output of CMP Binning, with Flex trace location data. \n\n \n\nFigure 29. Example Bin Fold Limit Flowchart. See text for further details. \n\n \n\nFigure 30 shows the dialog box for the Bin Fold Limit processing step.  \n\n \n\nFigure 30. Dialog box for the Bin Fold Limit. \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n \n\nTrace selection Method: The trace selection method specifies the criterion by which traces are \n\nselected from both the input data and the Flex traces.  \n\n? Nearest to within bin: Select to specify that the traces selected for each bin will be those \n\nwithin the bin plus those closest to the bin boundary, subject to the specified maximum \n\nfold. If removal of non-Flex traces (i.e. Those within the bin) is allowed, the traces selected \n\nwill be those closest to the bin centre. If checked, traces will be selected for inclusion in a \n\nbin by their distances from the bin boundary. \n\n? Nearest to bin centre: Select to specify that the traces selected for each bin will be those \n\nwithin the bin plus those closest to the bin centre, subject to the specified maximum fold. \n\nIf removal of non-Flex traces (i.e. Those within the bin) is allowed, the traces selected will \n\nbe those closest to the bin centre. If checked, traces will be selected for inclusion in a bin \n\nby their distances from the centre of the bin. \n\n? One trace per offset interval: This option aims to provide a full range of offsets within \n\neach bin by allowing just one trace per offset interval. This option can be overridden, if \n\nnecessary, using Override offset interval and selecting the desired number of traces per \n\noffset interval. \n\nThe CMP maximum fold: this does not apply when traces are selected for inclusion in a bin of one \n\ntrace per offset interval. Otherwise, it is possible to choose: \n\n? Maximum traces per bin: Specify the total number of traces that may be included in each \n\nbin. \n\n? Allow removal of non-Flex traces: If checked, and there are more (non-Flex) traces \n\nassigned to a bin than the specified Maximum traces per bin; then, those farthest from \n\nthe bin centre will be removed.  If not checked, only Flex traces which fall within the box \n\nwill be de-selected. \n\nIf the diagnostic print is selected, traces with mid-points within a bin will be removed if necessary \n\nto maintain the selected maximum fold. If not checked, these traces will not be removed, even if \n\nspecified maximum fold is exceeded.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n \n\n4.2.4 Flex coverage map  \n\nAnother missing item that was requested to be implemented was a map with the Flex location.  In \n\nthe latest version however, the Flex location file format was changed and therefore old format \n\nFlex location files cannot be used anymore and only Flex location files created with the newer \n\nversion can now be used to build the map from Flex File. The plotting routine used to create the \n\nFlex coverage maps is the same that was used in SPW to plot the fold coverage map. If the offset \n\nincrement when plotting a fold map from a Flex file is not 1, it will not work, and the software will \n\nprobably crashes. The SPW team tried to fix this, and put also reporting the offsets range on the \n\nFlex file dialog. This is a nice feature to have when plotting fold maps with different offsets. The \n\nnew parameters of Flex map (Figure 31) are described below. As concerns the Flex Locations file, \n\nan output file from the CMP Binning flow with output Flex locations should be used.  \n\n \n\nFigure 31. Dialog box to generate fold maps from a Flex Location File. \n \n\nThe trace selection method specifies whether standard binned traces (no Flex traces) or Flex-\n\nbinned data (include Flex traces) are to be used to generate the fold map: \n\n? No Flex traces: Select to specify that only the traces assigned to CMP bins without Flex-\n\nBinning will be included. \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n \n\n? Include Flex traces: Select to specify that all normally CMP-binned plus the Flex-binned \n\ntraces will be included. \n\nThe map display type specifies whether the output map is to be a binary coverage map (1=bin has \n\nat least one trace), or a fold map: \n\n? Coverage: Select Coverage to specify that a CMP bin will be given a value of 1 if at least \n\none trace is assigned to it. \n\n? Fold: Select Fold to specify that CMP bin will be given a value equal to the number of \n\ntraces assigned to it. \n\nThe offset specification allows selecting whether to include all offsets, or just ones of a selected \n\noffsets range: \n\n? Include all offsets: Select to specify that the traces at all offsets will be included in the \n\nbins displayed on the output map. \n\n? Specify an offset: Select to specify an offset and an offset interval which will restrict the \n\ntraces included in the bins on the output map. \n\n \nThe offset specification is made by the offset range for inclusion of traces.  \n\n? Offset: Specify the offset of trace to include in Binning on the output map. \n\n? Offset interval: Specify the offset interval to use. \n\n? Update: Specify the offset range for inclusion of traces. \n\n \nThe map title by default will be the project name, but the user may modify this name if required. \n\nThe map label by default will be text made from the specified parameters for easy reference, but \n\nthe user may modify this if required.  \n\nUnfortunately, it is not yet possible to make a fold/coverage map from a large Flex location file, \n\nbecause when we attempt to create the map from a Flex Locations File with 35.4 GB, the SPW \n\ncloses without creating any dump file, or error message. Maybe this happens because the file is \n\nvery big and the computer cannot find enough memory to allocate the map to be displayed. The \n\nsize of Flex Locations File generated by this process was 2.37 GB and the same problem always \n\nhappens. This problem still needs to be solved. \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n \n\n4.3 Beta testing, problems encountered and solutions \n\nadopted \n\nIn this section, the tests carried out in the scope of this work to analyze the performance of the \n\nFlex Binning Codes, detect problems and propose solutions are described. As stated above, these \n\ntests were first carried out on a medium size dataset to determine the main problems in the Flex \n\nroutines and try to solve them, if possible avoiding too long computational times and severe \n\nmemory issues (in some cases even just a portion of the medium size dataset was used for faster \n\ntesting and solution implementation). Once the main issues were identified and largely solved, a \n\nnew set of tests were performed in the Large Size Dataset to assess the full functionality of the \n\napplication of Flex Binning. All the tests were performed on a Windows Workstation with an i7-\n\n6700 (3.4GHz) processor with four cores, 32GB RAM and a 1TB SSD (a high speed access disk). \n\n \n\n4.3.1 Beta Tests of the Flex Binning Routines \n\nwith the Medium Size dataset \n\nDuring the Beta Testing of the Flex routines, several problems were encountered, both code \n\nissues and bugs. The inputs used in the Beta Testing have a large number of traces and headers, \n\nwhich influences the performance of the SPW, the computer hardware limits, and the processing \n\ntime. \n\nAt the beginning of the CMP Binning flow tests the medium size dataset (with 209 GB) was used \n\n(see details in Section 4.2.1 and Figure 24 in Section 4.2.2).  The CMP Binning flow did not run and \n\nthe software crashed. The indexing of the output from the CMP Binning flow was not written. \n\nAfter many tests with numerous versions of SPW to attempt to solve this problem, the CMP \n\nBinning flow code was finally corrected and is now able to run without any error message and to \n\nwrite correctly the index output file. The total elapsed time was 8 hours, 31 minutes, 53 seconds, \n\nfor a 200% Flex Binning.  The memory used when the CMP Binning flow was running was \n\napproximately 40-99%. It was discovered that until 70% of the processing job, the memory used \n\nwas fine (around the 50%), but after running 70% of the job, the memory usage increased \n\nsignificantly; for example, after 79% of the job was completed, the memory used stabilized in 98-\n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n \n\n99% until the end (Figures 32 A and B). This high memory usage has led us to detect hardware \n\nproblems caused by the software limitations. \n\nIn order to test where the problem was coming from, the same flow was run again, but without \n\nwriting the output Flex location file; in this case, the memory used behaved very well, and did not \n\nexceed 28%-50% (Figures 33 A and B). These results obtained with the medium size dataset (209 \n\nGB) showed that the problem was related to the writing of the output file and they were sent to \n\nthe SPW software development team to try to solve this problem. \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 32. Memory issues when the CMP Binning flow with the medium size input file. A) Until 70% of the processing \n\njob, the memory was fine. B) After running 79% of the job, the memory usage suddenly increased to 99%. \n\nA) \n\nB) \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 33. Memory usage when the CMP Binning routine was run without Flex Binning, i.e. without creating and output \n\nFlex location file.  \n\n \n\nA) \n\nB) \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n \n\nTo start realizing how the % bin Flex that was used could influence the time efficiency of \n\nprocessing, the same input was used, but with a slight change in the CMP Binning flow. This slight \n\nchange was the % bin Flex chosen which was now slightly higher (250% bin Flex in inlines and \n\ncrosslines). The total elapsed computing time was 9 hours, 17 minutes, 46 seconds. In comparison \n\nto the same job that was run with the 200% bin Flex in inlines and crosslines, the flow with 250% \n\nbin Flex in inlines and crosslines took approximately 10% more time to run when a 25% larger \n\npercentage of bin Flex was selected. \n\n \n\n4.3.2 Beta Tests of the Flex Binning Routines \n\nwith the Large Size Dataset  \n\nWith the improvement of the of Flex routines code, it was then possible to move to a new phase \n\nof the tests, namely using a much larger input file which came directly from the seismic data \n\nacquisition (see details in Section 4.2.1). The input file was now 462 GB and the CMP Binning flow \n\ndid not run and error messages appeared. The error messages that came up while processing \n\nrecord 1 of 5962 was \u201cError: The trace header CMP Eastings and Northings header values are bad \n\nor do not conform to the survey. Correct headers or survey corners and resubmit; Processed 1 \n\nrecords; error writing index file trace sort list - QFileDevice Error code 0; Error while writing the \n\nindex file: B27H27_after_cmpBinning.sgy\u201d. \n\nTherefore, in the input merged file it is necessary to first remove the bad traces. The Kill Traces \n\nstep was chosen to try to solve this problem (Figure 34 and Figure 35), but it did not work.  \n\n \n\nFigure 34. Experimental flow using the Kill traces step. \n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 35. Experimental Kill traces card. \n \n\nThe solution for this problem, implemented in the SPW software consisted in setting the traces \n\noutside the specified area (grid), due to incorrect coordinates, as dead traces, and flag them so \n\nthat these are not included in the output seismic file. After this correction, it was possible to run \n\nthe CMP Binning flow with bad traces or traces outside the grid, but still the flow still did not work \n\nsuccessfully.  \n\nA new error message now appears when the flow running: \u201c**Warning: Unable to allocate \n\nmemory for TraceHeadersList->ItsTraceHeaderArray in ScanSegyHeader\u201d. This error message \n\nmeans that we are running out of memory for the trace header list which was used to build the \n\nindex file. Solving this problem required some software design changes. The new updated version \n\nof SPW included changes made to the index file and now the index file is created at the end of the \n\nprocessing so that there will be a pause and scan of the data file before the \u201cProcessing Complete\u201d \n\nmessage appears. This way, the SEG-Y output is always completed and the index which requires \n\nsubstantial memory is created as a read after write operation on the output file, without the \n\nmemory failures that were happening due to the large size of the input file. \n\nAfter the software design changes described above, the CMP Binning flow now runs without any \n\nerror message and the program does not crash. The total running time was 14 hours, 25 minutes, \n\n7 seconds, for 200% Flex bin and the memory usage did not exceed approximately 50% (Figure 36). \n\nIn CMP Binning flow the input file is generally larger than the output file, because when the CMP \n\nBinning is applied, a 3D grid is defined and all traces outside the selected grid are considered as \n\ndead traces and removed. As before, the same CMP Binning flow was run again, but in this time \n\nwith a percentage of bin Flex of 250%. The memory used still remains quite low (Figure 37) and \n\nthe total elapsed time was now 16 hours, 6 minutes and 23 seconds. In comparison to the same \n\njob that was run with the 200% bin Flex in inlines and crosslines, the flow with 250% bin Flex in \n\ninlines and crosslines took approximately 12% more time to run when a 25% larger percentage of \n\nbin Flex was selected, similar to the results obtained from the medium size dataset. \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 36. The memory used when CMP Binning was run with 200% Bin Flex. \n \n\n \n\nFigure 37. The memory used when CMP Binning was run with 250% Bin Flex. \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n \n\nIn the final phase of this work, it was possible to run the CMP Binning flow for the largest dataset \n\nacquired in the survey area (751GB), with the final SPW version after all the testing, suggested \n\ncorrections and solutions implemented. The CMP Binning flow was able to run without any error \n\nmessages and the software did not crash. The total running time for this dataset was 22 hours, 26 \n\nminutes, 11 seconds. The memory usage did not also exceed 55% (Figure 38). \n\n \n\nFigure 38. The memory used by computer, when ran the CMP Binning with the largest dataset of the survey area. \n \n\nAfter fully testing and successfully solving all the problems associated with the CMP Binning Flex \n\nmode flow, a final test was carried out on the Bin Fold Limit flow. The trace selection method \n\nwhich was used in the CMP Fold Limit dialog box, was one trace per offset interval, which means \n\nassigning a trace to each bin, and not to have a regular fold. Some problems were detected in the \n\nBin Fold Limit flow, with a set of error messages displayed: \n\n\u201c*** Error: Mismatch - First In-line on file is 1; *** Error: Mismatch - First Cross line on file is 17 \n\n*** Error: Cmp Flex Locations survey parameters do not match this data. Please remake the file. \n\n*** Error: job initialization failed for process: Bin Fold Limit\u201d  \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n \n\nThese Bin Fold Limit flow error messages are caused by the fact that the SPW team had to add \n\nsome extra information to the Flex locations file to solve the issues detected during the execution \n\nof this work and these required changes in all subsequent flows. Also, at present, the Bin Fold \n\nLimit flow is also using too much memory while running (Figure 39), which also requires some \n\nextra software adjustments. More beta testing of this flow is now required.  \n\n \n\nFigure 39. Memory usage when running the Bin Fold Limit flow with the Largest Size Dataset. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n \n\n5.  Results and Discussion \n\nThe Flex Binning routines, after all the tests performed and the resolution of detected bugs and \n\ncode problems, is now working, which was one the main aims of this work. However, the Bin Fold \n\nLimit routine can still only be applied successfully to small datasets. For larger datasets, at present, \n\nthe only solution is to cut them into small datasets, apply the Flex Binning by parts, and then \n\nmerge the files, before performing the remaining processing steps.  \n\nIn this Chapter, we show an example of the application of the Flex Binning to a portion of a 3D \n\nblock from the study area, in which where the presence of data gaps is evident, to assess its \n\nperformance. \n\n \n\n5.1 Application of Flex Binning to a UHRS dataset \n\nNext, we show an example of the application of the Flex Binning to a portion of a 3D block from \n\nthe study area, in which where the presence of data gaps is evident (Figure 40). The bin size for \n\nthis block is 1mx1m. \n\n                        \n\nFigure 40.

In order to get the images represented in Figure 41, Figure 42 and Figure \n\n43 it was necessary to implement different % bin Flex for each seismic section. First, just to get an \n\nidea of the damage that can result when a too large flex percentage is used, a Flex bin percentage \n\nof 2000% (Flex Bin size of 21m x 21m) was assigned in both directions (crossline and inline). As can \n\nbe observed in Figure 41, the result is not good. Overlap of many shots, leads to the distortion of \n\nthe seismic data, causing a severe loss of resolution.  \n\n \n\n                       \n\nFigure 41.

As can be observed \n\nthere are no data gaps but there was a severe loss of resolution due to the choice of a too large Flex Bin percentage. \n \n\nNext, a Flex Binning of 200% was used in both directions (Figure 42); this means that the Flex Bin \n\nsize is now 3m x 3m, and therefore the new bin radius is 1.5m (see Figure 43). In this case, the \n\nFlex Binning fills in most of the gaps, but there still exist some gaps in the seismic data.  \n\n \n\n \n\nA) B) \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n2 1 \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n \n\n                        \n\nFigure 42.

Relation between bin radius and Percentage of Flex Bin. \n \n\nFinally, a percentage bin Flex of 235 was used for both directions and the Flex Binning works very \n\nwell, because it fills all the data gaps with an adequate seismic resolution (Figure 44). For a 235 % \n\nbin Flex, the Flex Bin size is 3.35m x 3.35m. In this case, the original bin radius of 0.5m increased \n\nto approximately 1.7m. \n\n1 2 \n\nA) B) \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n \n\n               \n\nFigure 44.

The implementation of an efficient and reliable Flex \n\nBinning to be applied to the data as soon as possible after data acquisition, if possible in the field, \n\nis a crucial step in industry as it will allow to assess the potential need or not to acquire new data \n\nbefore leaving the survey area. The SEG Y files used in the beta testing performed in the scope of \n\nthis work contained more traces than the expected in a conventional seismic dataset, which \n\nhighlighted software limitations, since SPW was not prepared for such data size. Besides the \n\nnumber of traces, there are at least 26 headers for each trace. This causes extra difficulties in the \n\nperformance of the SPW, the computer hardware limits and time efficiency of processing. \n\nBeta testing of the CMP Binning flow in different size datasets allowed code efficiency issues and \n\nsoftware bugs to be detected, which allowed advances in the implementation of Flex Binning for \n\nlarge inputs, namely the successful execution the flow to a dataset with 751GB, which was a \n\nA) \n\n2 \n\n2 \n\n1 \n\nB) 1 \n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n \n\nmajor step forward. Before this work and tests, it was only possible to effectively apply Flex \n\nBinning to an input dataset with a size not greater than approximately 30 GB.  \n\nTo successfully implement the CMP Binning step to a dataset with a substantial number of traces, \n\none of the major issues was the inability to apply a grid to the dataset and leave traces out of the \n\ngrid. The traces outside the specified area (grid) are now set as dead traces, and it is possible to \n\nflag those traces, so that the output seismic file does not include them. \n\nIndexing was another issue which was solved by a change of software design in the CMP Binning \n\ncode. The index problem consisted in the fact that the flow is running out of memory for the trace \n\nheader list used to build the index file. The SPW team worked for to overcome this problem, \n\ncreating an updated version of SPW which enables the index file to be created at the end of the \n\nprocessing, so that there will be a pause and scan of the data file before the \u201cProcessing Complete\u201d \n\nmessage appears. This way, the SEG Y file is always completed and the index, which requires \n\nsubstantial memory, is created as a read after write operation on the output file, without the \n\nmemory failures that were happening before due to the large dataset being processed. \n\nAnother critical issue that was solved concerns the memory usage in run time. In the first tests of \n\nthe CMP Binning flow, the memory used by the computer was approximately 90%, but with the \n\ncode improvement, now running the CMP Binning step with a large input only takes about 50% of \n\nthe memory of the computer.  \n\nThe time efficiency of processing is also very important. Beta testing allowed understanding how \n\nthe processing time for different input files varies. The processing time can reach 22 hours, 26 \n\nminutes, 11 seconds for an input dataset with 751 GB, to get the Flex File Location card and the \n\nseismic output with the grid implemented. \n\nRemaining issues to be solved include: \n\n? The Bin Fold Limit flow adds Flex traces to the input binned data from an input Flex table. \n\nDue software design changes in the Flex Location File, the Bin Fold Limit flow does not yet \n\nwork very well. This needs to be addressed. \n\n? The map with the Flex location still does not work, because when we try to create the \n\nmap from a Flex Locations File even with a relatively small dataset, some error messages \n\nstill appear and SPW closes without any dump file. More testing on the Bin Fold Limit flow \n\nand generated Flex locations map is needed. \n\n\n\n \n\n62 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n \n\n6.  Conclusions \n\nIn general, the main objectives of this thesis were achieved. The main aim, which was to make the \n\napplication of Flex Binning to large Ultra High Resolution Seismic Datasets a reality, by testing the \n\nexisting software, detecting bugs and code issues and collaborating with the SPW development \n\nteam on solving these issues, was completed. Finally, testing the application of the latest Flex \n\nBinning Flow to the largest dataset available in Geosurveys has proven a major step forward as it \n\ndemonstrated the feasibility to use this method in the field just after data acquisition, which may \n\nsave considerable time and money. \n\nGaps in 3D data cause highly adverse impacts in several steps of the data processing, making it \n\nimpossible to obtain a final processed migrated volume. In the context of the implementation of \n\nMonopile foundations for offshore wind farms it is fundamental to be able to detect faults, \n\nboulders and other geological structures which represent a risk for the Monopile foundations \n\nimplementation. Offshore wind farms are gaining popularity in the world and due to the current \n\ninterest in the need for greener energy sources, security of energy supply and the public\u2019s \n\nreluctance to have wind farms on-shore. Efficient high resolution methods and quick ways to test \n\nthe adequacy of the acquired data or the need to re-run parts of the survey as early as possible \n\nare fundamental. \n\nThe Flex Binning method is simple and fast when compared with alternative solutions (statistical \n\ninterpolation and regularization) and therefore less expensive. The principle behind this step was \n\nused to correct navigation problems and feathering movements of the streamer during \n\nacquisition, because the Flex Binning can be a solution for irregular acquisition geometry. \n\nSeveral tests were performed on the Seismic Processing Workshop software to accomplish the \n\npurpose of this work. Beta testing on CMP Binning flow allowed advances in the implementation \n\nof Flex Binning to large inputs, namely the execution this flow successfully to a dataset with \n\n751GB. The Beta testing on SPW permitted to find problems in the code, and solve most of them. \n\nThe issue of creating a map with the Flex location is already underway, but more work is still \n\nneeded to solve it; and the same goes for the implementation of the Bin Fold Limit flow. \n\nA good data Flex Binning is one which when applied to the dataset allows filling in the coverage \n\ngaps, without distorting the seismic data and without loss of resolution. The amounts of coverage \n\ngaps will influence the percentage which is to be used for the Flex bin. More data gaps require \n\n\n\n \n\n64 \n \n\nlarger flex percentages. High values of % Flex bin means that the search area will be also large. If \n\nthe Flex trace search area is too large, then the greater the number of traces that are borrowed \n\nfrom neighboring bins and there will be significant amounts of traces to fill empty bins that may \n\nnot to reliable estimates of the missing data. Due to this fact, the ability to distinguish seismic \n\nevents can be lost, which leads to loss of seismic resolution making it impossible to detect small \n\ngeological structures such as boulders, with potential risks for the Monopile foundations. \n\nConsequently, it is necessary to use common sense and care when using the Flex Binning, when \n\nthe final product of seismic processing requires high seismic resolution. \n\nIn Future work, it is essential to continue to improve the code and beta testing of the CMP Binning \n\nflow, the Bin Fold Limit flow and generate fold maps from Flex File. The bin expansion in SPW \n\nshould take the form of an ellipse in the future, where the shortest part is the direction of \n\nacquisition, thus allowing greater collection of traces. \n\nThe implementation of the Flex Binning in real-time during acquisition together with QC also in \n\nreal time is now the goal for the future. This great advance will permit to reduce the infill/reruns \n\nmade during the acquisition, to fill the gaps data, allowing to control the acquisition costs. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n65 \n \n\n7.
