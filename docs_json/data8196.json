The purpose of this dissertation is to analyse the \n\ninfluence of the current crisis on the sale price of second hand vehicles. A linear \n\nregression model was estimated using the Ordinary Least Squares procedure, based on a \n\nsample of used cars sold in Portugal, since 2005 to 2012. Macroeconomic variables \n\nsuch as Unemployment Rate, Oil Prices, Loans granted to Private Individuals, Private \n\nConsumption Indicator, Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices, among others, were \n\ntested in the estimated regression. In addition, some variables representing the own \n\nvehicle characteristics were also included. Finally, an out-of-sample analysis was \n\nperformed to evaluate the predictive ability of the linear regression model. Results \n\nsuggested that some of the selected macroeconomic indicators actually influence the \n\nsale price of an automobile sold in the secondary market and due to its predicting \n\ncapacity can be useful to pricing procedures or just for asset valuation. \n\n \n\n \n\nJEL classification: C21; E31. \n\nKeywords: car sale price; used cars market; automobile industry; macroeconomic \n\nvariables. \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\nV \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nI would like to express my gratitude to Professor Jos\u00e9 Dias Curto, for his guidance, \n\npatience, support, relevant recommendations, and for all the time spent with me during \n\nthe execution of this dissertation. \n\nI must also thank Marco Pinto, for sharing his knowledge and enthusiasm about this \n\nsubject.

INTRODUCTION \n\nAfter a period of a strong economic expansion across the world, the 2008 global \n\neconomy slowdown triggered many consequences in several different scopes. The crisis \n\nin the financial sector restricted the access to credit and shifted the borrowing \n\nconditions. As a result, domestic investment and consumption demand declined, \n\naffecting the national production in general. \n\nIn the majority of countries, the unemployment increased significantly which \n\nreduced the households\u2019 disposable income and therefore the purchasing power. \n\nConsumers needed to become more rational and redefine more carefully their \n\npurchasing decisions, not just because of the uncertainty about future income levels but \n\nalso because of the reduction on the economic growth expectations. \n\nWithin this crisis environment, the automotive industry has been one of the most \n\nresented sectors. \n\nAs a durable good, a car is an acquisition particularly sensitive in times of difficulties \n\nto access credit and when disposable income is decreasing, since it needs a certain \n\nmoney amount. When facing a period of such uncertainty, consumers can postpone the \n\ndecision of acquiring a new car to the future when economic conditions will probably \n\nbe more stable; instead of buying a brand new car, they can choose to purchase a second \n\nhand vehicle or even to sell their current car without replacing it due to the high costs \n\n(insurance, maintenance, fuel, among others) of owning an automobile. \n\nCar retailers, renting companies and other businesses related with the automobile \n\nindustry, did not manage to create appropriate mechanisms to minimize the negative \n\ncrisis impact. Some products continued to be overpriced, asset valuations were still \n\noverestimated and residual values of renting companies, for instance, were not \n\ncalculated in the proper way. If macroeconomic factors and different scenarios were \n\ntaken into account earlier, this issue would possibly have been addressed and computed \n\nwith more accuracy and, even though it could bring immediate losses, the damage \n\ncaused would probably have been lower. \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n2 \n\n \n\n278.470\n265.174\n\n276.606 275.127\n\n203.760\n\n272.754\n\n191.362\n\n113.435\n\n0\n\n50.000\n\n100.000\n\n150.000\n\n200.000\n\n250.000\n\n300.000\n\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012\n\nSales of New Vehicles in Portugal (in units)\n\nIn Portugal it is estimated that sales of all new vehicles dropped more than 59%, \n\nsince 2005 to 2012 and this was one of the largest falls in car sales of European \n\ncountries, which can be observed in appendix A. \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Sales of New Vehicles in Portugal (in units) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: chart created by the author, based on the data available on the OICA website. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe information available about the evolution of second hand car sales is scarce \n\nsince it is very hard to collect accurate data about the total sales by private individuals \n\nand used car dealers but it would be interesting to observe whether the impact on used \n\ncar sales was similar to the decline in new car sales.  \n\nAs previously mentioned, if by one hand the current crisis can delay consumer\u2019s \n\ndecision of buying a new vehicle, on the other hand it may lead the buyer to prefer \n\nacquiring a used car since it is a more affordable choice in times of economic \n\ndifficulties. But does the global crisis environment influence the sale price of a used \n\ncar? Which are the factors that better explain the variations on the average sale price in \n\nautomobiles secondary market? Do the impacts of these factors follow the expected \n\npositive or negative pattern? \n\nAlthough many academic researches have compared the evolution of macroeconomic \n\nvariables with the volume of car sales, few explored the link between the performance \n\nof macroeconomic factors and the automobiles sale price, especially concerning \n\nsecondary markets. \n\nThe aim of this dissertation is to analyse the influence of economic indicators in the \n\naverage sale price of used cars in Portugal, from 2005 to 2012. \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n3 \n\n \n\nIn order to investigate this issue, it will be estimated an econometric model to infer \n\nabout the effect on the vehicle sale price caused not only by the car\u2019s own \n\ncharacteristics but also by fluctuations in macroeconomic variables. The dataset used \n\ncontains second hand cars sold by the leading company in the operational leasing and \n\nfleet management market in Portugal. The sample contains sales since 2005 until 2012, \n\nwhich includes the recent economic downturn. \n\nRegarding vehicle\u2019s own characteristics, the brand, the body style, the vehicle kind, \n\nfuel type, number of doors, cylinder capacity, the list price of the vehicle when it was \n\nbought new, the mileage and the age, will be the variables used in the model. \n\nConcerning the economic environment, the macroeconomic variables that will be tested \n\nin the regression are: real oil prices, exchange rate, loans to private individuals, long-\n\nterm and short-term interest rates, EURIBOR, harmonized unemployment rate, sales of \n\nnew passenger cars, harmonized index of consumer prices, economic activity coincident \n\nindicator, private consumption coincident indicator, economic sentiment indicator and \n\nconsumer confidence indicator. \n\nOther macroeconomic variables would be interesting to test, however there were no \n\nmonthly available data. Nonetheless, the quantity of indicators and their qualitative \n\ncharacteristics can help to conceive a reliable picture of the country\u2019s economic \n\nsituation. \n\nSince it is important to take into account that the current crisis may have relevant \n\nconsequences not only in the volume of sales but also in the sale price of a used vehicle, \n\nthe model estimated in this thesis can be useful to predict more accurately the car \n\npricing and residual values or just for asset valuation purposes. \n\nThe remainder of the thesis is organized as follows. Next section provides an \n\noverview of previous studies in related areas, such as durable goods, second hand \n\nmarkets, economic crisis and the determinants of car sales. Then, it specifies the dataset \n\nand the variables as well as the model and the estimation procedures used in this \n\ndissertation. Afterwards, it describes and analyses the model results in section 4. To \n\nconclude, the main results are summarized in the final section, where it is also given an \n\ninsight about the thesis limitations and extensions to pursue in future researches.  \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n4 \n\n \n\n2. LITERATURE REVIEW \n\nThis section gives a brief bibliography review and aims to address the different \n\nresearch areas related to this study, in order to provide a flowed walkthrough along the \n\nexplored topics and a further insight on the subject, thus allowing a better understanding \n\nof the thesis theme. \n\n2.1. DURABLE GOODS AND SECONDARY MARKETS \n\nThere are some useful academic researches that can help to better understand the \n\nlogic behind the behaviour of consumers towards durable and non-durable goods, the \n\nrelationship between first and second hand markets as well as the main differences \n\namong new and used markets. \n\nBlack and Cusbert (2010) examined cycles in spending on durable goods in Australia \n\nsince 1960 until 2010 which included the recent economic downturn, providing a \n\ncomparison with USA. The authors define durable goods as a flow of services or utility \n\nover time. On the contrary, non-durable goods and services are usually immediately \n\nconsumed. Then they estimate the correlation between GDP and the consumption of \n\ndifferent types of goods and services (see appendix B1), concluding that spending on \n\ndurable goods is likely to be more cyclical than spending on non-durable goods and \n\nservices since it can be more easily postponed in times of an economic slowdown. For \n\ninstance, a household that faces a reduction in income may choose not to acquire a new \n\ncar since one can continue to use its current car. The same does not happen when \n\ndeciding to buy food, since this kind of purchase cannot be delayed so easily. By this \n\nway, consumer spending on durable goods is more volatile than spending on non-\n\ndurable goods and services, as can be seen in appendix B2. Also in this paper, we can \n\nfind two different effects of some governments temporary subsidies targeted as \n\nspending on consumer durables: it reduced the price of durables relative to non-durables \n\nand the current price became lower regarding its future price; in addition, it boosted \n\ninter temporal substitution, with consumers deciding to purchase goods immediately \n\nrather than waiting for better future financial conditions. \n\nHeim (2009) developed and tested different macroeconomic consumption demand \n\nfunctions for durable goods, nondurable goods and services, using USA 1960-2000 \n\ndata. The models explain, respectively, 94%, 86% and 81% of the variance in each \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n5 \n\n \n\none\u2019s demand. The demand for durables, such as automobiles and home appliances, \n\nappeared to be driven by the disposable income, wealth, the exchange rate, availability \n\nof consumer credit, interest rates on consumer credit, demand for new housing and \n\npopulation growth. Regarding the demand for nondurables, like groceries and clothes, \n\nthe model revealed to be similar to the durables model, with the exception of new \n\nhousing demand and exchange rate variables. Finally, the demand for services like \n\nlaundry and entertainment services proved to be influenced by the disposable income, \n\nwealth and population growth as well as mortgage interest rates paid by households. \n\nIn order to understand the dependence between new and second hand markets, it is \n\nimportant to fully understand why secondary market exists. Van Cayseele (1993) \n\nprovides a framework answering this question, by justifying it with the durability and \n\nthe volatility of the durable. \n\nGoods give utility to the consumer over a number of periods. Hence, as soon as the \n\nconsumer gets enough of it, he wants to replace the good for superior performance or to \n\nbetter serve more urgent needs. Consequently, he will try to resell the commodity. The \n\nauthor argues that secondary markets re-allocate durables from agents taking out a low \n\nutility, to agents that at the moment can extract a higher usefulness. If the durability of a \n\ngood is longer, the probability for a consumer to drop the asset and decide to buy \n\nanother one will increase in order to provide more utility. So, durability constitutes the \n\nfirst condition to the existence of second hand markets since over the time it will \n\ndiminish the utility for some consumers. \n\nAs a second condition, the good quality needs sufficient volatility. For instance, an \n\neconomic depreciation could appear if the costumer has no further need of the good or \n\njust because of an increase on the car\u2019s maintenance cost. If the quality of the durable \n\nand the user income varies throughout time, it will probably create a secondary market \n\nfor such a good. \n\nAs Van Cayseele (1993) but with a macroeconomic approach, Scitovsky (1994) \n\nexplained the existence of the secondary markets by investigating its impact on the \n\noverall economy and probing it through Keynes approach and Say\u2019s law. \n\nConsumers frequently react to a variation of their income by shifting their demand \n\nbetween new markets and secondary ones which are cheaper. For instance, owners of \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n6 \n\n \n\nsecond hand cars are more or less prone to hold their vehicles according to the variation \n\nof prices. A change on income can lead to a transfer of demand from secondary markets \n\nto cheaper goods of new markets, and therefore accelerate the initial fall or rise in the \n\nincomes. Hence, when the elasticity of substitution between the durables traded in a first \n\nand a second hand market is relatively high, their prices turn out to be interdependent \n\nand a disruption of their market equilibrium can affect both their prices. Thus, \n\nsecondary-markets usually unsettle the economy\u2019s macro equilibrium, by stimulating or \n\ndepressing it. \n\n Therefore, second hand markets comprise two main roles: it mitigates the \n\ninequalities by allowing poorest individuals to buy cheaper commodities whilst it \n\nstimulates the economy by facilitating the replacement of obsolete durable goods. \n\nIn the short term, an effect in one of the markets generates a temporary obstacle to a \n\nprice change and triggers a movement on the other market in the same direction. On a \n\nsubsequent period, the used market\u2019s disequilibrium slowly releases the restrictions to \n\nan equilibrating price modification. The result depends on the size of the second hand \n\nmarket and it becomes more significant in countries with high standard of living. \n\nConcerning the difference in the quality of new and used markets, Akerlof (1970) \n\ndeveloped the lemons model. An automobile may have a good or a bad quality (which \n\nin America is called as \u201clemons\u201d) and initially a buyer knows that with probability q it \n\nis a good car and with probability (1-q) it is a lemon. Nevertheless, cars of different \n\nqualities have been selling at a common price since it is impossible to distinguish one \n\nfrom another. Buyers tend to look for statistics to judge and to get more information \n\nabout the quality of prospective purchases but only the seller knows the difference. \n\nHereupon, there is an incentive for sellers to supply poor quality durables and, as a \n\nresult, there tends to exist a reduction of the average quality of goods, which implies a \n\nprice adjustment. \n\n So, the lemons model basically assumes that owners of used cars have an \n\ninformational advantage over potential buyers with respect to the quality of their \n\nvehicles. Consequently, the average quality of traded automobiles is thus lower than the \n\naverage quality of the whole population of cars, which suggests that bad used cars drive \n\nout the good ones of the market because they sell at an equal price to good cars. \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n7 \n\n \n\nWith these conclusions, Akerlof explains why used cars valuation is so much lower \n\nthan new cars valuation since there is a significant lack of perfect information among \n\ndealers and consumers and he also explains why this quality uncertainty may lead to \n\nsignificant economic costs of dishonesty. \n\nIn response to the lemons model, leasing automobiles and Certified Pre-Owned \n\n(CPO) programs can help to lighten the costs of asymmetric information about the \n\nquality uncertainty of second hand durable goods. Sultan (2010) examined the possible \n\nimpacts of these both solutions to the lemons problem and his results reveal that leasing \n\nand CPO cars actually supply good quality used cars to the market and improve \n\nsubstantially the info mechanism between sellers and buyers, reducing the adverse \n\nselection. \n\nThe substitution of commodities is commonly made among primary and secondary \n\nmarkets. Prado (2009) aimed to analyze its interdependence on a macroeconomic \n\nperspective, in France, UK and USA. The author also tried to check the accuracy of the \n\nfollowing mechanisms (2009: 10):  \n\n\u201cThe new market feeds the used market\u201d \u2013 Past new markets may be \n\npositively correlated with today\u2019s second hand car market, regarding volume and \n\nprices. \n\n\u201cRenewals\u201d\u2013 Drivers have to renew their automobiles after some years, \n\nwhich may create cycles on both markets. \n\n\u201cVolume effect\u201d \u2013 An increase in transaction volumes caused by the supply \n\nside could lower the price. If an increase in transaction volumes is caused by a \n\ngreater demand, it could higher the prices. \n\n\u201cPrice effect\u201d \u2013 A price increase could negatively impact the demand side, \n\nand could either have a positive impact on supply side \n\n\u201cArbitration\u201d \u2013 A buyer can purchase a car on the new market or on the used \n\nmarket, but a car cannot be bought on both markets at the same time. \n\n\u201cReallocation\u201d \u2013 Since high prices in new cars lead buyers to move to the \n\nsecond hand market, the used car prices increase as well. In the short term, \n\nvolume and prices move in the same direction in both markets. \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\u201cIncome Effect\u201d \u2013 A decline of income reduces the demand, the transaction \n\nvolumes and by this way the prices go down in both markets. On the other hand, \n\nit could shift consumption from new to the used market. \n\nResults can be seen in appendix C and the main conclusion is that the interrelations \n\nbetween both markets are not strong enough to entirely explain patterns but in some \n\nway the used market of the present is linked to the new market of the past, not just \n\nthrough volumes but also through prices. It is also highlighted that interactions differ in \n\nthe three countries studied according to a short-term or a long-term perspective but it \n\ndoes experience rigidity of both used car volumes of transactions and new car prices. \n\nPashigian (2001) observed that USA used car prices index has much more volatility \n\nthan new car prices index. The author believes that while the new cars price volatility \n\nhas been lowering through decades, the decline for used cars has been imperceptible \n\nregarding the updates in car price index, despite the fact that used cars prices are the \n\nmore volatile in the Consumer Prices Index. \n\nSecond hand automobile markets tended to have less elastic supply curves and to \n\nface larger demand shocks compared to those noticed in the first hand cars market and \n\nother durable goods markets. \n\n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 New and Used Car Price Volatility Caused by demand Shifts \n \n\n \nSource: Pashigian, 2001. \n\n \n\nThe correlation found between annual price ratio for used cars and the annual price \n\nratio for new cars was 0.3, which indicates that a raise in the demand for first-hand cars \n\nis positively related with an increase in the demand for second hand cars. \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n9 \n\n \n\nAlthough there has been a significant amount of academic researches on the subject \n\nof durable goods, there are still many questions regarding the existence and organization \n\nof secondary markets. \n\n2.2. ECONOMIC CRISIS AND THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY \n\nThere is a long-standing literature investigating the impact of the current economic \n\ncrisis on the automobile industry. Over the last years, consumers and companies were \n\nforced to respectively rethink their patterns of standard of living and their strategies in a \n\ncontext of a new and a more adverse financial and economic environment. \n\nUsing historical data on currency crisis across the world, Dutt and Padmanabhan \n\n(2010) analysed the consumer\u2019s response to crisis and points out compelling patterns in \n\nconsumer behaviour. When experiencing a crisis, the consumer behaviour is defined by \n\na consumption smoothing at different levels (inter-temporal, inter-category and intra-\n\ncategory) which by turn reallocate consumption expenses. The authors find out that a \n\ncrisis main immediate impact is on consumption indicators and the effect persists longer \n\nin developing economies when compared to developed economies. They also find that \n\nconsumption expenditure declines more than income in more than 70% of developing \n\ncountries. Considering both economies, examining the decline in expenses in the year of \n\nthe worldwide crisis, on average, the consumption decreased 20% in durable goods, \n\n14,5% in services, 9,5% in semi-durables and a 7% in non-durables. Once more, this \n\nleads us to the conclusion that income elasticity of demand is the highest for durables \n\nand the lowest for non-durables. \n\nWithin this crisis environment, the automotive industry has been also experiencing a \n\ndownturn. Sturgeon and Van Biesebroeck (2010) stated that with the crisis, the credit \n\nmarket froze and consequently orders were cancelled, the suppliers didn\u2019t receive their \n\npayments and many plants were forced to shut down, at least temporarily. The debt \n\nincreased dramatically, the labour costs and fixed-capital costs also became higher, and \n\npension and health care plans turned the situation even worse. Since the automobile \n\nmarket is more expensive and with a growing longevity, buyers in a crisis period tend to \n\npostpone their purchases, which they would probably have made within better economic \n\nconditions. As the authors mentioned (2010: 6), \u201cConsumers, especially in the world's \n\nlargest national passenger vehicle market, the United States, found it difficult to obtain \n\nloans for purchase and, driven by fear of job loss, moved aggressively to increase their \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n10 \n\n \n\nrate of saving. Vehicle sales plunged and as a result, beginning in the fall of 2008, \n\npushing the industry into its most severe crisis since the Great Depression.\u201d \n\nHaugh, Mourougane and Chatal (2010) also studied the consequences of the \n\nfinancial crisis in the automobile industry, analyses the evolution through time in \n\ndifferent regions and makes a comparison between some countries. \n\nUsing econometric estimations, they find out that the current credit constraints could \n\nexplain more than 80% of the downfall in automobile sales at the end of 2008 in Canada \n\nand in USA. The difficulties in accessing to credit led numerous households to delay \n\ntheir car purchases, which in turn resulted in a sharp decline of demand and, \n\nconsequently, in an excess of the production capacity in major car manufacturers\u2019 \n\ncountries. Hereupon, the authors make some projections (2010:2):  \n\n\u201cWhile a rebound in car sales is likely in North America, Japan and the United \n\nKingdom, car sales in Germany have been pushed significantly above trend and may \n\nweaken going forward. Over the medium term, in mature markets such as Europe and \n\nNorth America, trend sales are likely to remain stagnant. By contrast, rapid increases \n\nare foreseen in China and to a lesser extent in India\u201d (see appendix D). \n\nThe authors also show a strong correlation between private consumption and car \n\nsales and, when comparing to other countries, Portugal is the third with the highest \n\ncorrelation coefficient, after USA and Denmark.  \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Correlation between Private Consumption and Car Sales \n\n \nSource: Datastream; OECD Economic Outlook 86 database (Haugh et al., 2010). \n\n \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n11 \n\n \n\nAnd, although Portugal appears to have a medium/low GDP per capita, the country \n\nis still on the Top 5 of the countries with the largest number of cars per 1000 inhabitants \n\n(Figure 4). \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Car ownership and GDP per capita \n\nSource: Denatran Brazil; United Nations; OECD calculations (Haugh et al., 2010). \n\n \n\n2.3. DETERMINANTS OF AUTOMOBILE SALES \n\nBased on the review of researches, several factors have been recognized as \n\ninfluencing car sales, such as the fluctuation in fuel prices, the disposable income and \n\nthe unemployment rate variations, the new constraints to credit availability, among \n\nother issues of concern. \n\nHeim (2008) checked econometrically the relative influence of diverse variables in \n\nthe consumption function, using USA data from 1960 to 2000. He comes to the \n\nconclusion that the current income is undoubtedly the main determinant of \n\nconsumption, explaining 68% of its variance, followed by a crowd-out variable (14%) - \n\nthat measures the effect of government deficits on the availability of consumer credit - , \n\nwealth (5%), consumer interest rates (2%) and exchange rate changes (1%). The author \n\nalso compares Keynes to the Friedman/Modigliani hypotheses of consumption function. \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n12 \n\n \n\nWhile Keynes argued that the demand for goods and services was basically determined \n\nby current income and possibly, with smaller effects, by wealth, interest rates, taxes and \n\npotential savings; Friedman/Modigliani developed the Permanent Income/Life Cycle \n\nHypotheses, where the desire to keep rationally constant living standards influences the \n\nconsumption function, since it relies on current income (as Keynes defended), as well as \n\non a person\u2019s sense of what their annual average income will be over a longer time \n\nhorizon. Heim accomplishes that the majority of the fluctuation in consumption is \n\nlinked with the current income but that the Permanent Income/Life Cycle hypotheses \n\nalso helps to explain an additional, albeit a minor part of consumer behaviour. \n\nCruceru and Micuda (2010) drove an analysis of the linkage between lending and the \n\nvolume of cars sold. To acquire durable goods, such as automobiles, the consumer \n\nneeds to resort to a certain amount of income, which may arise from the salaries they \n\ncurrently earn or from previously accumulated wealth. Using a Pearson correlation \n\ncoefficient, they note that since 2009, due to job uncertainty and the decreasing of \n\nrevenues, buyers turned less to credit. In this paper, we can also find a comparison of \n\nthe correlation between bank loans and car registrations of different brands, which leads \n\nthem to conclude that the cars with lower prices are more accessible to low and medium \n\nincome consumers, who finance their car purchases with credit. By contrast, more \n\nexpensive or luxury cars were bought with cash by customers with high financial \n\nresources. \n\nGasoline prices are also one of the major factors influencing the decision-making of \n\nacquiring a vehicle. Busse, Knittel and Zettelmeyer (2009) investigated whether \n\ncustomers have adjusted to its variations by changing their car purchases not only \n\nregarding new and used markets, but also in the prices they pay. As an example, a \n\ncommon driver at early-1999 spent around $758 per year on gasoline and at mid-2008 \n\nthe same driver would have had to spend up to $ 2968 to travel the same distance in the \n\nsame car.  \n\nSince automobiles are durable goods, potential consumers must take into account not \n\nonly the initial cost of purchasing a car but also the ongoing costs of using the car and \n\nsince fuel is one of the largest costs of owning an automobile, it is expectable to be one \n\nof the most important determinants in the decision making of acquiring a new one. \n\nConsumers can also adjust these usage cost variations by taking advantage of the variety \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n13 \n\n \n\nin fuel efficiency of available vehicles. For instance, the authors found that a $1 increase \n\nin gasoline prices changes the market share of the most fuel-efficient type of new cars in \n\n+20% and of the least fuel-efficient cars in -24%, while on the other hand, the same \n\nincrease in gasoline prices changes the market shares of the most and the least fuel-\n\nefficient used cars in +3% and -7%, respectively.  \n\nThe main conclusion of the paper is that changes in usage costs result in larger \n\nmarket changes than price variations regarding new car markets, while in the used car \n\nmarket, the adjustment is primarily made and larger in prices. Thus, it is expected that, \n\nin response to fuel price changes, sellers of used cars adjust its price and dealers of new \n\ncars choose not to change prices, and experience market share changes instead. \n\nIt was very hard to find researches about the influence of different vehicle \n\ncharacteristics on used car pricing. Shing (2002) investigated it, as well as depreciation. \n\nThe author computed three different econometric models to test the effects of the \n\nvariables and results showed that both age and mileage caused the value of a car to \n\ndeteriorate, while original price, horse power and the global origin of the vehicle \n\ncontributed positively. \n\nSince, average quality of new passenger cars in the Portuguese market is growing at \n\na fast pace and that this phenomenon has to be considered in the estimation of price \n\nindexes, Reis and Silva (2002) examined the effects of quality change on the price index \n\nfor new passenger cars in Portugal since 1997 to 2001. Results revealed that the quality \n\nof new cars sold in Portugal during the period studied improved on average 4.8 per cent \n\nper year and that the overall CPI may have been overestimated by about 0.15 percentage \n\npoints per year, which led the authors to suggest the price indexes to be regularly \n\nupdated since the alterations on the quality of such goods are clearly growing. \n\nAn estimation of hedonic prices was also made for cars in Spain (Matas and \n\nRaymond, 2009), addressing the instability of coefficients over time. According to the \n\nauthors, despite car prices index deflated car prices between 1981 and 2005, real car \n\nprices fell by 40%, once quality improvements were taken into account in the research. \n\nIn order to solve the limitation of the instability of the coefficients, which can be found \n\nin the majority of other regressions, two alternative estimation procedures were \n\nproposed: one based on a moving sample of observations and the other based on \n\nmoving average of estimation coefficients in single period equations. \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n14 \n\n \n\nThere are also many other factors that can influence a car purchasing decision, which \n\nare not so visible, such as information availability to consumers, promotional \n\nenvironments and a customer\u2019s trade-in (Zeng, Dasgupta and Weinberg, 2012). This \n\nresearch showed that consumers who used the Internet to search for a good and those \n\nthat were offered a manufacturer rebate saved, on average, $481 and $2,126, \n\nrespectively. Also, consumers who traded-in their old automobiles ended up paying, on \n\naverage, $159 more on the new car than consumers who did not trade-in. Another \n\ninteresting result is that the higher the bargainers\u2019 ability, the more price reductions they \n\nwill achieve since they have greater tendency to search for price information and thus \n\nare better at identifying suppliers that offer a lower initial price. \n\nBut, as expectable, each variable can have a different impact on the average price \n\nand on volume car sales depending upon the country we are studying. Smusin and \n\nMakayeva (2009) studied the relationship between ten macroeconomic variables and \n\nnational car sales based on a sampling from three different countries namely Belarus, \n\nRussia and Ukraine. With basic instruments like correlation and the observation of \n\ntheoretical hypotheses tested with linear regressions, they find that real estate prices are \n\nthe most strongly correlated variable with car sales. The R\u00b2 of the different models \n\nshows that a great portion of car sales fluctuations can be explained by macroeconomic \n\nfluctuations - R\u00b2 values were calculated to be 83%, 84% and 75% for Belarus, Russia \n\nand Ukraine, respectively. A similar study was made by Muhammad, Hussin and Razak \n\n(2012), for five Asian countries: Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines and \n\nIndonesia. Results showed that GDP, inflation, unemployment rate and loan rate have \n\nsignificant long term correlation with automobile sales and that each country is \n\ninfluenced by different variables in the short term period. Thus, they suggested financial \n\nand fiscal policies to prevent such an impact since the sales rate in the automotive sector \n\nis one of the most important reference to economic growth in any particular country. \n\nRegarding Portuguese automobile sales, Monteiro and Moutinho (2010) analysed its \n\nevolution using a database of 24 years and estimating an econometric model with eleven \n\ndifferent variables, such as population, GDP, household disposable income, consumer \n\nconfidence indicator, unemployment rate, inflation rate, interest rate, fuel prices, VAT \n\nrate, loans to firms and rewards to deliver the old car. The authors concluded that there \n\nwas no statistical evidence about the relationship between car sales and the economic \n\nenvironment. Only inflation rate, unemployment and household disposable income \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n15 \n\n \n\nproved to be statistically relevant. Yet, the factors that influenced automobile sales \n\ntended to be different for each vehicle kind, except the unemployment rate and the oil \n\nprices, which influenced car sales in every type of automobiles.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n16 \n\n \n\n3. METHODOLOGY \n\nThis section describes the main features of the cross-section data employed in this \n\nthesis, as well as the treatment applied in order to make it more manageable and to get a \n\nmore standard sample. Moreover, it is also referred the statistical methods used to \n\nconstruct a linear regression model and the tests applied in order to investigate the \n\nhypotheses of macroeconomic variables impacting on the sale price of a used car. \n\n3.1. DATA SOURCES AND DATA TREATMENT \n\nThe dataset used in this dissertation contains vehicles sold by LeasePlan Portugal, in \n\nthe secondary-market during January 2005 until December 2012. The data was kindly \n\nprovided by the company, a global fleet and vehicle management enterprise which sells \n\nits cars at the end of the renting car contract. \n\nThe automobiles included in this sample are only the vehicles sold as a common \n\nsecond hand car. The cars bought with the buyback option for the driver were not \n\nincluded. Despite this, firstly it is better to take into account that some of the vehicles \n\nwere sold through different types of channels, such as in a B2B or a B2C approach, in \n\nauctions, among others, which may have an impact on the average sales price. \n\nSecondly, a large part of the cars is sold with only a few years of usage. If by one hand \n\nconsumers suspect that vehicles being sold with short ages can be due to the bad quality \n\nof the car (Akerlof, 1970), on the other hand, they may not have the same felling about \n\nshort age cars when sold by a renting car company because they know that it happens \n\nonly due to the end of the vehicle\u2019s contract and, consequently consumers can be more \n\ndisposed to pay a higher price for the automobile. Finally, LeasePlan Portugal offers a \n\ntwo-year warranty, which can positively influence the price that the buyer is willing to \n\npay, as well. However, the average prices of the automobiles are similar to the ones sold \n\nin the usual secondary market and to its market value indicator. \n\nThe initial number of observations was 70,605. Due to the lack of information for \n\ncertain variables, a few cars were excluded from the dataset, ending up with 69,810. A \n\nsubsample was randomly selected with the purpose of testing afterwards the predictive \n\nability of the model, representing less than 10% of the total observations. \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n17 \n\n \n\nFor every observation, information is available about the vehicle characteristics, for \n\ninstance, the model of the car, the extras value, the registration and the sale date as well \n\nas the sale price (excluding VAT), among many other features. In the next subsection \n\nthe reader can find the variables chosen for the model to evaluate the impact of the own \n\nnature of the car on its sale price. \n\n Regarding the external forces that could also have impact on the sale price, several \n\neconomic and financial variables were collected, in the majority from the websites of \n\nthe Portuguese national bank, the Portuguese automobile association (ACAP), Eurostat, \n\nOECD and the European Central Bank.  \n\nFor each vehicle in the sample it was assigned the respectively value of the different \n\nmacroeconomic variables, according to the date that the car was sold. \n\n3.2. VARIABLES DESCRIPTION \n\nThe variables selected to test in the regression model were mainly divided by the \n\ninformation that represents the specific characteristics of the own car and by the values \n\nof macroeconomic factors at the date of sale of the car. \n\n3.2.1. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OWN VEHICLE \n\nWhen considering what car to buy, there are many aspects to consider in the \n\ndecision-making process. \n\n One that has very impact on this decision is the Brand that the consumer prefers and \n\nthat one can afford. The different trademarks of the cars represented in the dataset used \n\nin this thesis can be found in Table 1. \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Car brands represented in the sample \u2013 Absolute (#) and Relative (%) Frequency \n\n \n\nSource: the author. \n\nBrand # % Brand # % Brand # %\n\nALFA ROMEO 338 0,48% JAGUAR 58 0,08% PORSCHE 7 0,01%\n\nAUDI 3006 4,31% JEEP 6 0,01% RENAULT 13687 19,61%\n\nBMW 3028 4,34% KIA 19 0,03% ROVER 38 0,05%\n\nCHEVROLET 24 0,03% LANCIA 56 0,08% SAAB 76 0,11%\n\nCHRYSLER 34 0,05% LAND ROVER 31 0,04% SEAT 2069 2,96%\n\nCITROEN 3264 4,68% LEXUS 45 0,06% SKODA 250 0,36%\n\nDODGE 6 0,01% MAZDA 401 0,57% SMART 250 0,36%\n\nFIAT 1226 1,76% MERCEDES 1963 2,81% SUZUKI 36 0,05%\n\nFORD 6603 9,46% MINI 37 0,05% TOYOTA 2091 3,00%\n\nHONDA 358 0,51% MITSUBISHI 640 0,92% VOLVO 733 1,05%\n\nHYUNDAI 135 0,19% NISSAN 595 0,85% VW 7197 10,31%\n\nISUZU 19 0,03% OPEL 14052 20,13%\n\nIVECO 101 0,14% PEUGEOT 7331 10,50% Total 69810 100%\n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n18 \n\n \n\nThe Body Style is another issue that is very relevant in the buyer\u2019s choice. A \n\ncustomer may want to buy a cabriolet car to meet his personal preferences or a minivan \n\nto better fit the family needs. He can also wish to buy a small van, for instance, to fulfill \n\nthe needs of his company. \n\nHereupon, the Vehicle Kind also varies between distinct vehicles inasmuch as the \n\nsale price of a passenger car is certainly different from a commercial car. Other aspects \n\nto take into account are: the Fuel Type, since a diesel automobile is more expensive \n\nthan a gasoline vehicle; the Number of Doors because usually a car with three doors, in \n\nPortugal, has less demand than a car with five doors, for instance; and also a car with \n\nlow Cylinder Capacity is cheaper than one with a higher.  \n\nAnother variable used in the regression model was the car List Price, which is the \n\nprice of the automobile when sold for the first time by the manufacturer to the buyers, \n\nincluding the base price, the price of the options (extras in the vehicle such as leather \n\nupholstery, parking sensors, etc.) and the tax on vehicle charged at the moment of the \n\nacquisition. The List Price does not include the VAT. \n\nSince the purpose is to analyse the price variations of used cars, it is also relevant to \n\nconsider depreciation variables such as Mileage (in kilometres) and Age (in months), at \n\nthe moment of the vehicle sale. Regarding the mileage, the values were all divided by \n\n1,000 in order to reduce the scale of the variable, when compared with other ones. \n\nConcerning the automobile\u2019s age, since the devaluation of the car is greater during its \n\nfirst years and smaller when the car has already a higher age, the natural logarithm of \n\nthis variable was computed and used in the model because the depreciation of the \n\nvehicle regarding its age does not seem to be linear. \n\nThe color of the vehicle would also be interesting to include in the regression because \n\nthe demand varies according to the different colors (for instance, black or grey cars have \n\nmore demand than yellow cars). Therefore, there was not standard information in the \n\nsample. \n\nAnother interesting variable would be the vehicle\u2019s model life-cycle, in other words, it \n\ndescribes whether the car is a facelift of its model or if it was sold before another new \n\nversion, but it was also not possible to include it in the regression due to the lack of \n\ninformation. \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n19 \n\n \n\n3.2.2. MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES \n\nThere were some difficulties when finding macroeconomic variables with daily and \n\nmonthly frequency since a large part are calculated quarterly and annually, which would \n\nnot be the desirable for this dissertation since the length of the period represented in the \n\nsample (2005-2012) is not so wide to create a significant variation in the variables. It \n\nwas also challenging to choose the most representative variables of the current \n\nconjecture since there are several and also because the majority of them influence each \n\nother or indirectly represent the same issue. \n\nConcerning the monthly data, for each observation it was assigned the correspondent \n\nvalue to the month of the date of sale and, regarding the daily data, it was assigned the \n\nday in which the car was sold. Vehicles that were sold at the weekend or in day holidays \n\nreceived the previous working day available value. \n\nAs mentioned in Busse et al. (2009), one of the larger costs when operating a car is \n\nthe fuel, which makes it an important issue to take into account when deciding to own \n\none. Hereupon, the variable real oil prices was selected to reflect its variations.  The \n\nhigher the oil price, the lower will be the car sales price since consumers will look for \n\nless expensive ways of transportation, which will consequently decrease the demand of \n\nautomobiles. This indicator is represented by the Europe Brent Spot Price (in dollars per \n\nbarrel). \n\nAnother obstacle that has been imposed when making the decision of buying a car is \n\nthe decreasing access to credit. Most of the automobiles in Portugal are bought with \n\nloans granted to private individuals whereby the lower the availability of credit to \n\nfinance the vehicle\u2019s purchase, the lower will be the demand as well as the sale price of \n\nautomobiles. The values represent the annual growth rate of loans granted to households \n\nby other monetary financial institutions, in Portugal.  \n\nWith the same rationale, the higher the long-term or the short-term interest rates \n\nas well as the three months EURIBOR, the more expensive will be resorting to credit \n\nwhich in turn also impact negatively on the sale price. \n\nWith the global financial crisis, the unemployment rate also increased significantly, \n\nreducing the disposable income of households and their purchasing power. By this way, \n\nconsumers delay even more a possible acquisition of a car. \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n20 \n\n \n\nThe reduction of the purchasing power might have influenced not only the demand of \n\nused cars but especially the volume of new automobile sales. New vehicles are clearly \n\nmore expensive than used ones and if a buyer does not hold conditions to buy a brand \n\nnew car, he can choose between keep using the car that he already owns or to purchase a \n\ncar in the second hand market. Therefore, this thesis also tests the impact of the \n\ndownturn on sales of new vehicles in the price of the cars sold in the Portuguese \n\nsecondary market. In order to keep it simpler and because the majority of the vehicles in \n\nthe dataset are passenger cars, only the value of new passenger automobiles are included \n\nin the regression model. \n\nAdditional economic indexes such as the Economic Activity, the Private \n\nConsumption Coincident Indicator, the Consumer Confidence and the Economic \n\nSentiment Indicators may also influence the evolution of the average sale price of used \n\nautomobiles, in a positive way if they increase or negatively if they decline. \n\nThe global harmonized index of consumer prices can have two counteracting \n\neffects: on the one hand the rise of prices in an economy also includes the increase of \n\ncar prices and the inflation often coincides with the rising of average wages and, \n\nconsequently, the purchasing power of consumers; on the other hand, if global prices \n\nincrease, the demand can decrease and, as a result, the car sale price tend to decline. \n\nThus, the inflation is probably one of the less clear intuitive effects on vehicle prices. \n\nAnother variable that does not have a very intuitive effect regarding used cars is the \n\nexchange rate. If the foreign currency depreciates in relation to the domestic currency, \n\nimported cars will also become cheaper (although a large portion is usually bought in \n\ncountries with the same currency as Portugal). Thus, the demand for new cars will raise \n\nand probably the demand for used cars will decrease, lowering its average sale price. On \n\nthe other hand, the higher the value of the Euro, the greater will be the power \n\npurchasing to acquire raw materials, such as oil. By this way, fuel becomes more \n\naffordable and automobile\u2019s demand raise, thereby increasing the average sale price, \n\neven of used vehicles.  \n\nOther variables such as disposable income, gross domestic product, private \n\nconsumption, tax burden, purchasing power and saving rates of households would be \n\nalso interesting to include in the model, despite some of them are related to each other, \n\nbut there were not daily nor even monthly information available. \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n21 \n\n \n\nIt is expected that some of the aforementioned selected variables to test will \n\neventually be excluded from the regression, since they probably influence each other or \n\neven because they basically explain the same issue, leading to multicollinearity \n\nproblems. \n\nIn appendix E, the reader can find the frequency, the units, the expected signs as well \n\nas the sources of each macroeconomic variable selected to test in the regression and can \n\nalso find some graphics about its evolution since 2005 until 2012, in appendix F. \n\n3.3. THE MODEL AND THE ESTIMATION PROCEDURE \n\nIn order to examine which variables may have influenced the variations in the sale \n\nprice of used automobiles from 2005 to 2012 in Portugal, it was considered a linear \n\nregression model, where the dependent variable was the sale price of the used car. \n\nThe model is presented as follows:  \n\nSPi = ?0 + ?1LPi + ?2 ALFAROMEOi + \u2026 + ?37VWi + ?38MILEAGEi + ?39 LOG (AGEi) + \n\n?40DOORSi + ?41DIESELi + ?42CCi + ?43CABRIOi + \u2026 + ?57VANi + ?58 COMMERCIALi \n\n+ ?59 OILPRICESi + ?60LOANSi + ?61LONGIRi + ?62SHORTIRi+ ?63EURIBORi + \n\n?64UNEMPi+ ?65SALESNEWi+ ?66ECONACTi +?67PCINDi + ?68CONSCONFi + \n\n?69ECONSENTi + ?70 HIPC+ ?71 EXCRATEi+ ?i \n\n \n\nWhere, \n\nSPi  Sale Price of the vehicle i \n\nLPi  List Price of the vehicle i \n\nALFAROMEOi A dummy variable which assumes the value 1 if the Brand of the vehicle i is Alfa \n\nRomeo and the value 0, otherwise \n\nVWi  A dummy variable which assumes the value 1 if the Brand of the vehicle i is \n\nVolkswagen and the value 0, otherwise \n\n There are 36 dummy variables representing the same number of sold brands. \n\nMILEAGEi Mileage of the vehicle i at the moment of sale \n\nLOG (AGEi) Natural logarithm of the age of the vehicle i at the moment of sale \n\nDOORSi  Number of doors of the vehicle i \n\nDIESELi  A dummy variable which assumes the value 1 if the fuel type of the vehicle i is diesel \n\nand the value 0 if gasoline \n\nCCi  Cylinder Capacity of the vehicle i \n\nCABRIOi A dummy variable which assumes the value 1 if the body style of the vehicle i is \n\ncabriolet and the value 0, otherwise \n\n( I ) \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n22 \n\n \n\nVANi  A dummy variable which assumes the value 1 if the body style of the vehicle i is van \n\nand the value 0, otherwise \n\n There are 15 dummy variables representing the same number of different body styles. \n\nCOMMERCIALi  A dummy variable which assumes the value 1 if the i is a commercial vehicle and the \n\nvalue 0 if i is a passenger car \n\nOILPRICESi Price of  imported oil barrel to European countries, at the date of sale of the vehicle i \n\nLOANSi  Loans granted to private individuals by other monetary financial institutions in Portugal, \n\nat the date of sale of the vehicle i \n\nLONGIRi Long-term Interest Rate in Portugal, at the date of sale of the vehicle i \n\nSHORTIRi Short-term Interest Rate in Portugal, at the date of sale of the vehicle i \n\nEURIBORi Three months EURIBOR, at the date of sale of the vehicle i \n\nUNEMPi Harmonized Unemployment Rate in Portugal, at the date of sale of the vehicle i \n\nSALESNEWi Sales of New Passenger Vehicles in Portugal, in the month of sale of the vehicle i \n\nECONACTi Economic Activity Coincident Indicator in Portugal, at the date of sale of the vehicle i \n\nPCINDi  Private Consumption Coincident Indicator in Portugal, at the date of sale of the vehicle i \n\nCONSCONFi Consumer Confidence Indicator in Portugal, at the date of sale of the vehicle i \n\nECONSENTi Economic Sentiment Indicator in Portugal, at the date of sale of the vehicle i \n\nHICPi  Harmonized Indicator of Consumer Prices in Portugal, at the date of sale of the vehicle i \n\nEXCRATEi Reference Exchange Rate US dollar to Euro, at the date of sale of the vehicle i \n\n?i  The error term. \n\n \n\nInitially the model was estimated in SPSS using the stepwise procedure, in order to \n\ndetermine which of the variables explained the most variation of the dependent variable \n\nand also to obtain multicollinearity diagnostics. Thereafter, without the variables whose \n\nestimated coefficients are not statistically significant and the variables excluded because \n\nof the possible aforementioned problems, the regression was estimated in EViews, by \n\nthe Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method, to detect and to test other problems related \n\nwith errors of the model, specially the heteroskedasticity. \n\nAlso, in order to identify possible outliers when analysing the OLS regression \n\nresiduals, the following criterion was applied: the observations whose residual absolute \n\nvalue was higher than three standard deviations were excluded from the estimation \n\nprocess. \n\nHaving the regression procedures finalized, certain out-of-sample analyses were \n\nmade with the purpose of testing the performance of the regression. The results of the \n\neconometric model, the tests procedures and the out-of-sample analysis can be found in \n\nthe next section. \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n23 \n\n \n\n4. RESULTS \n\nIn this section the estimation procedure and the econometric tests will be described \n\nalmost step-by-step and the results obtained will be revealed. Also, the out-of-sample \n\nresults will be analysed in order to conclude about the predictive ability of the estimated \n\nregression.  \n\n4.1. ECONOMETRIC TESTING PROCEDURE \n\nAs described in the previous section, it was used a criterion to exclude some outliers \n\nbased on the absolute value of residuals since it could bias or distort the OLS estimates. \n\nThe impact of this decision in the estimation results can be observed in appendix G. \n\nOnly a few outliers were identified and the model was estimated with the suspected \n\noutliers excluded. \n\nWhen using the stepwise method in SPSS there was evidence of multicollinearity \n\nproblems, as expected, which means that one or more predictor variables in the \n\nregression were highly correlated. Hence, the explanatory variables Economic \n\nSentiment Indicator, Short-term Interest Rate, Three Months EURIBOR, Harmonized \n\nIndex of Consumer Prices, Private Consumption Coincident Indicator and Harmonized \n\nUnemployment Rate have been excluded from the regression due to its statistically \n\ninsignificance or due to multicollinearity problems. \n\nAfter the estimation procedure in SPSS, the regression was also estimated in EViews \n\nin order to perform other statistical specification tests\n1\n. \n\nThe result of the White test showed that there was evidence of heteroskedasticity, \n\nwhich means that we cannot assume the constant variance for the errors, given the \n\nexplanatory variables. Hence, despite heteroskedasticity does not cause bias or \n\ninconsistency in the OLS estimators, the usual OLS standard errors were no longer valid \n\nfor constructing confidence intervals and statistics such as t, F or LM, even though we \n\nare dealing with a large sample size. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1\n Due to the data cross section nature, autocorrelation tests were not performed. \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n24 \n\n \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Heteroskedasticity Test: White \n\n     \n     \n\nF-statistic 189.6809     Prob.

EMPIRICAL FINDINGS \n\nAfter estimating the model both in SPSS and in EViews with the aim of diagnosing \n\npossible problems such as multicollinearity and heteroskedasticity, the linear regression \n\nand its output was prepared to be analysed. \n\nThe coefficient of determination, is quite high (R\u00b2 = 0.925823), which means that, \n\nfor this sample, the explanatory variables included in the model explain almost 92,6% \n\nof the total variation in a used car sale price and only 7,4% of the variation of dependent \n\nvariable is not explained in the regression. Thus, the independent variables selected for \n\nthe regression are actually good predictors of second hand car prices. The adjusted R-\n\nsquared is also very similar (  \u00b2 = 0.925758) to the R\u00b2. \n\nThe output with the model estimated coefficients can be observed in Table 3. \n\nTable 3 \u2013 Linear Regression Output \n\n      \n\n Coefficient Std.

The same happens with the \n\nautomobile\u2019s mileage: on average, the used car sale price is expected to decrease around \n\n\u20ac168.24 per each 10,000 miles driven, ceteris paribus. Regarding the age, since the \n\nvariable was assessed with the natural logarithm, its interpretation should be as follows: \n\nif the vehicle\u2019s age (in months) increases 1%, the car sale price is expected to decrease \n\naround \u20ac26.44, on average, if all the rest remain constant. \n\nJust for the sake of curiosity, some descriptive statistics of the quantitative variables \n\nrepresenting the own vehicle\u2019s features can be found in the following table: \n\nTable 4 \u2013 Descriptive statistics of some explanatory variables, concerning the vehicle\u2019s own characteristics \n\n    Source: the author. \n\nThe macroeconomic factors that at the end showed to have influence on the used car \n\nsale price were: Real Oil Prices; Loans granted to Private Individuals; Long-term \n\nInterest Rates; Sales of New Passenger Vehicles; Economic Activity Coincident \n\nIndicator; Consumer Confidence Indicator; and, finally, Exchange Rate. All the \n\nvariables assumed the initially expected signs and the Exchange Rate, which seemed to \n\nbe less intuitive, assumed a positive sign which means that, on average, the higher the \n\nexchange rate, the higher will be the sale price of a used car. \n\nVariable Mean Standard Deviation Minimum Maximum\n\nList Price  (in euros) 22.683,09 10.735,36 6.120,17 164.531,06\n\nCylinder Capacity (in units) 1.660,81 370,11 599,00 5.439,00\n\nMileage (in thousands of units) 113,51 49,16 10,00 269,99\n\nAge (in m onths) 44 11 12 97\n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n27 \n\n \n\nThe interpretation of the macroeconomic variables coefficients estimated in the \n\nregression should be also made according to the way it was previously described. In \n\nother words, if the price of the barrel imported to European countries increases $1, the \n\nused car sale price is estimated to decline \u20ac8.47, on average, ceteris paribus, as well as \n\nif Consumer Confidence Indicator raises by one unit, the dependent variable is expected \n\nto increase, on average, \u20ac14.83, if all the rest remain constant. By the same way, the \n\nexpected variation on the used car sale price in response to more 10,000 new passenger \n\nvehicles sales, is a reduction of approximately \u20ac44.15, on average, if everything else \n\nremain constant. If long-term interest rates raise one unit, the second hand car sale price \n\nis expected to decrease, on average, \u20ac26.86, ceteris paribus, for instance. \n\nOther variables such as Economic Sentiment Indicator, Short-term Interest Rate, \n\nthree months EURIBOR, Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices, Private Consumption \n\nCoincident Indicator and Harmonized Unemployment Rate were dropped from the \n\nregression, because they proved to have multicollinearity problems, as previously \n\nexpected.  \n\n4.3. OUT-OF-SAMPLE ANALYSIS \n\nAs previously mentioned, 6,810 vehicles were randomly selected and removed from \n\nthe initial sample in order to further test the regression model proposed in this \n\ndissertation. This out-of-sample include automobiles with sale dates spread over the \n\nyears from 2005 to 2012 and almost all the different Brands and Body Styles used in the \n\nestimated model. \n\nFor each used car in the out-of-sample, the predicted sale price was computed using \n\nthe estimated regression and then this result was compared with the sale price actually \n\nobserved. Also, some measures based on prediction errors were computed in order to \n\ninvestigate the predictive capacity of the estimated model. \n\n The mean error result was -27.00895, which means that the predicted values are \n\nsomewhat biased because the estimated values of the sale price are higher in \u20ac27.01, on \n\naverage, than the observed values. This difference is very small taking into account the \n\nindependent variable scale. But, since the errors tend to nullify each other (some are \n\nnegative and other are positive), other adjusted measures were calculated with the \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n28 \n\n \n\npurpose of better evaluating the closeness between the predicted values and the values \n\nactually observed. \n\nThe Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) gives an insight of the weight of the \n\nerrors percentage and is given by: \n\n      \n \n\n        \n\n  \n\n \n   \n\n \n \n\nwhere   and    represents the observed values and the estimated values of the \n\ndependent variable, respectively. Its result was 13.65%, which leads to the conclusion \n\nthat, taking into account that the sample size is large, the weight of the percentage errors \n\nis small. \n\n Another performance measure used was Theil\u2019s inquality coefficient, also known as \n\nTheil's U, was computed as follows: \n\n  \n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\n  \n   \n\n \n \n\n \n   \n\n  \n \n\n \n    \n\n  \n   \n\n \n   \n\n, \n\nThe obtained result was U = 0.1016. The Theil's U statistic is bounded between 0 and \n\n1 where the more accurate the forecasts, the lower will be the value of the U statistic. \n\nSince the result is low and the value is closer to zero, the adjustment between the \n\nobserved and the estimated values is quite good. \n\nThe following formulas were also computed: \n\n   \n         \n\n \n\n \n         \n\n  \n   \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n       \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\n  \n   \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n          \n\n \n\n \n         \n\n  \n   \n\n \n\n( II ) \n\n( III ) \n\n( IV ) \n\n( V ) \n\n( VI ) \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n29 \n\n \n\nWhere       ,   and   are respectively the sample means and standard-deviation of \n\n  and     and   represents the linear correlation coefficient between the observed and the \n\nestimated values. \n\nThe value of U\nM\n\n measures systematic errors and if a high value is observed (greater \n\nthan 0.1 or 0.2), this means that there is a systematic bias. Since the U\nM\n\n result, regarding \n\nthe out-of-sample, is 0.0003 it leads us to conclude that there is no evidence of \n\nsystematic errors in the difference between the observed and the estimated values. \n\nU\nS\n provides an insight about the difference between the standard deviations among \n\nthe observed and the estimated values. The value obtained was 0.025. If the result was \n\nhigh, it would mean a greater variability between each series, explaining a large portion \n\nof the inequality between the values. \n\nU\nC \n\nmeasures the unsystematic error and the lower the correlation coefficient between \n\nthe observed and the estimated values, the higher will be U\nC\n. The result of U\n\nC \nwas \n\n0.975. \n\nThe ideal allocation of inequality among these three measures would be U\nM\n\n= U\nS\n = 0 \n\nand U\nC\n= 1. As one can see, despite the results obtained are not perfect, its values seem \n\nto be good, which can lead us to conclude that the estimated regression has a certain \n\npredictive capacity and a somewhat forecasting accuracy. \n\n  \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n30 \n\n \n\n5. DISCUSSION \n\n5.1. MAIN CONCLUSIONS \n\nIn a context of a global economic and financial crisis, many macroeconomic factors \n\nhave taken a different course: the difficulties felt in the banking system tightened the \n\naccess to credit not only for private individuals but also for companies; the majority of \n\nconsumers had to reconsider their consumption habits and to reallocate their income and \n\nexpenditures in order to maximize their benefits; national production resented and \n\ngenerated a high unemployment level; among many other aspects. \n\nSpecifically, the automobile industry in Portugal suffered many consequences and \n\nregistered a fall of more than 59% regarding the Portuguese new vehicles sales, from \n\n2005 until 2012. When facing such a stressful financial situation, the buyer can decide \n\nto postpone its new car purchasing or can even prefer to buy a car in the secondary \n\nmarket instead of acquiring a brand new car. Therefore, if by one hand the sale of new \n\nautomobiles fell significantly, on the other hand sales of used cars may have benefited \n\nfrom it. \n\nThe purpose of this thesis was to examine the impact of the current economic \n\nenvironment on the sale price of second hand vehicles sold in Portugal, since 2005 to \n\n2012. In order to achieve this goal, a linear regression model was estimated using OLS \n\nprocedures and this estimation was based on a sample of used cars sold by the major \n\nPortuguese renting company. The regression was comprised with the own \n\ncharacteristics of the vehicle (such as Brand, Body Style, Cylinder Capacity, Age at \n\nsale, Fuel Type, etc.) and with some macroeconomic variables. The dependent variable \n\nwas the used car sale price. \n\nResults suggest that not only the vehicle\u2019s own features are statistically significant, \n\nbut there is also evidence that macroeconomic factors actually have impact on the \n\ndependent variable. Variables such as Real Oil Prices, Exchange Rate, Long-term \n\nInterest Rates, Loans granted to Private Individuals, Economic Activity Coincident \n\nIndicator, Consumer Confidence Indicator and Sales of New Passenger Vehicles proved \n\nto influence used automobile sale price and all of them assumed the expected signs. \n\nAn out-of-sample was used to analyse the predicting capacity of the estimated \n\nregression and some measures based on prediction errors were computed in order to \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n31 \n\n \n\nevaluate this issue. Even though results are not perfect, they seem to be good, which can \n\nlead to conclude that the estimated model has a relevant predictive capacity and a \n\nsomewhat forecasting accuracy. \n\n \n\nThe conclusion of the research is that in fact macroeconomic variables may have \n\ninfluence on the sale price of a second hand vehicle and an econometric model \n\ncomprised with the car\u2019s own characteristics and macroeconomic variables can have a \n\ngreat predictive capacity, which may be useful to pricing purposes or just for asset \n\nvaluation. \n\n5.2. LIMITATIONS AND FURTHER RESEARCHES \n\nOne of the major limitations of the thesis was the difficult access to macroeconomic \n\nvariables. Other factors such as the households\u2019 disposable income, the saving rates and \n\nthe tax burden, for instance, would also be interesting to test in the regression model but \n\nthey were not all available mainly because they are just computed quarterly or even \n\nannually. The data available about second hand cars in Portugal is also scarce and \n\nrestricted.  \n\nAt the predictive level, there are no available forecasts for the values of the \n\nmacroeconomic variables included in the regression which constraints the predictive \n\ncapacity of the model for the future. One possible solution is to conceive three different \n\nscenarios: one optimistic, one pessimistic and one somewhat in the middle. \n\nAnother limitation was the fact that there may be a lag between the variables time \n\nand the moment that the buyer actually takes its values into consideration. Many times, \n\nconsumers (households or companies) do not react immediately to variations in the \n\nmacroeconomic explanatory variables but tend to do it only after a certain period of \n\ntime. For example, if the buyer decides to buy a car at time t, he can only take into \n\nconsideration the values of the indicators of t-1.This would be an important issue to \n\naddress in further researches. \n\nAn additional interesting research would be to investigate which macroeconomic \n\nvariables may impact on new vehicle sale price and it would also be stimulating to study \n\nmore deeply the relationship between new automobile and used vehicles sales, in \n\nvolume and in prices, during the last years within an environment of economic crisis. \n\n\n\nTHE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE \n\n32 \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nAkerlof, George A.
