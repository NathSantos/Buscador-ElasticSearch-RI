These targets outperform \nthe other related targets for the production of the same beams. However, they \npresented either slow release rates (yields) from the beginning or a rapid \ndecrease over time. This problem was believed to come from the target \nmicrostructure degradation, justifying the material investigation. \nIn order to do so, the synthesis, reactivity in ambient air and sintering kinetics of \nCaO were studied, through surface area determination by N 2 adsorption, X-ray \ndiffraction for crystalline phase identification and crystallite size determination, \nand scanning and transmission electron microscopy to investigate the \nmicrostructure.  \nThe synthesis studies revealed that a nanometric material is obtained from the \ndecarbonation of CaCO 3 in vacuum at temperatures higher than 550\n\noC, which \nis very reactive in air. This reactivity was studied, and it was observed that the \nCaO powder microstructure is changed through the reaction with air (hydration \nand carbonation of the oxide) and that this change is not completely reversible \nafter thermal decomposition of the reaction products. Therefore, special care \nwas taken in the target handling at CERN-ISOLDE. From the sintering kinetics, \nstudied in the range of 1000-1200oC, it was determined that this material\u2019s \nmicrostructure degrades, with the reduction of the specific surface area and \ndecrease of the powder porosity. At 1200oC, the specific surface area reduction \nis accentuated, reaching values of 50% of surface area reduction in 10h. These \nresults suggest that the use of high temperatures, equal or higher than 1000oC \nmust be avoided, if the microstructural characteristics of the targets are to be \npreserved. \nAt CERN-ISOLDE, selected conditions for synthesis, handling of the target and \ntarget operation temperatures were chosen, based on the previous material \nresearch, and the obtained target material was tested under proton irradiation. \nFrom the online studies, the newly developed target proved to show better \ninitial and stable over time release rates of almost all isotopes investigated and \nespecially the exotic ones. These results are essentially due to the nanometric \ncharacteristics of the produced target and to the use of operation and handling \nconditions that decreased the degradation of the microstructural characteristics.  \nDiffusion studies of Ar and Ne were also done in CaO through the application of \na mathematical model, to the release curves of the respective isotopes at \ndifferent temperatures, which enables the determination of the respective \ndiffusion coefficients and activation energies. \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\npalavras-chave Feixes de i\u00f5es radioativos, decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o de CaCO3, sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de CaO, \ndifus\u00e3o, reatividade do CaO, CERN, ISOLDE, ISOL \n\nresumo Alvos de p\u00f3s de oxido de c\u00e1lcio (CaO) t\u00eam sido usados, com sucesso, no \nCERN-ISOLDE para produzir is\u00f3topos de \u00c1rgon (com d\u00e9fice de neutr\u00f5es) e de \ncarbono, sob irradia\u00e7\u00e3o com prot\u00f5es a alta temperatura (>1000oC). Estes alvos \nt\u00eam mostrado um desempenho superior a outros alvos usados para produzir \nos mesmos feixes. Contudo, apresentam baixas taxas de liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de \nis\u00f3topos desde o in\u00edcio de opera\u00e7\u00e3o ou uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o r\u00e1pida com o tempo. \nSuspeitou-se que este problema se devia \u00e0 degrada\u00e7\u00e3o da microestrutura do \nmaterial, justificando a sua investiga\u00e7\u00e3o. \nAssim, a s\u00edntese, reatividade em ar ambiente e a cin\u00e9tica de sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o do \nCaO foram estudadas, nomeadamente atrav\u00e9s da determina\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1rea \nsuperficial especifica por adsor\u00e7\u00e3o de N2, difra\u00e7\u00e3o de raios-X para \nidentifica\u00e7\u00e3o de fases e determina\u00e7\u00e3o do tamanho de cristalite e microscopia \neletr\u00f3nica de varrimento e transmiss\u00e3o para o estudo da microestrutura. \nOs estudos de s\u00edntese do CaO revelaram que um material nanom\u00e9trico, e \nmuito reativo em ar, \u00e9 obtido atrav\u00e9s da descarbonata\u00e7\u00e3o do CaCO3 em v\u00e1cuo \na temperaturas superiores a 550oC. Esta reatividade foi estudada e observou-\nse que a microestrutura do p\u00f3 de CaO \u00e9 alterada por rea\u00e7\u00e3o com o ar \n(hidrata\u00e7\u00e3o e carbonata\u00e7\u00e3o do \u00f3xido) e que esta altera\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o \u00e9 totalmente \nrevers\u00edvel ap\u00f3s decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e9rmica dos produtos de rea\u00e7\u00e3o. Assim, foram \ntomados cuidados especiais no manuseamento dos alvos de CaO. Da cin\u00e9tica \nde sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o, estudada na gama de 1000-1200oC, foi conclu\u00eddo que a \nmicroestrutura deste material se degrada com redu\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1rea superficial \nespec\u00edfica e diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da porosidade do p\u00f3. A 1200oC, a redu\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1rea \nsuperficial espec\u00edfica \u00e9 acentuada, atingindo-se valores de 50% de redu\u00e7\u00e3o em \ncerca de 10h. Estes resultados indicam que a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de temperaturas \nelevadas, iguais ou superiores a 1000oC, devem ser evitadas se se pretendem \npreservar as caracter\u00edsticas microestruturais dos alvos. \nNo CERN-ISOLDE, as condi\u00e7\u00f5es de s\u00edntese, de manuseamento do material e \ntemperatura de opera\u00e7\u00e3o do alvo foram escolhidas, com base nos estudos \nanteriores, e o material resultante foi testado sobre irradia\u00e7\u00e3o de prot\u00f5es. \nDos estudos online, o alvo desenvolvido provou ter melhores taxas de \nliberta\u00e7\u00e3o iniciais e que se mant\u00eam ao longo do tempo de liberta\u00e7\u00e3o, \ncomparativamente a outros alvos de CaO previamente usados no CERN-\nISOLDE. Isto verificou-se em praticamente todos os is\u00f3topos estudados, \nespecialmente nos ex\u00f3ticos. Estes resultados foram atribu\u00eddos \u00e0s \ncarater\u00edsticas nanom\u00e9tricas do alvo produzido e \u00e0 utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de condi\u00e7\u00f5es de \nmanuseamento e de opera\u00e7\u00e3o, tais que a degrada\u00e7\u00e3o das caracter\u00edsticas \nmicroestruturais do alvo \u00e9 reduzida. \nEstudos de difus\u00e3o de \u00c1rgon e N\u00e9on foram feitos no CaO atrav\u00e9s da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o \nde um modelo matem\u00e1tico \u00e0s curvas de liberta\u00e7\u00e3o dos respetivos is\u00f3topos a \ndiferentes temperaturas de opera\u00e7\u00e3o, que permitiram a determina\u00e7\u00e3o dos \nrespetivos coeficientes de difus\u00e3o e energias de ativa\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n \n\n \n\ni \n\n \n\nTable of Contents \n\nList of Figures ......................................................................................................... iii \n\nList of Tables ......................................................................................................... vii \n\nLists of Symbols and Abbreviations ........................................................................ ix \n\nIntroduction .......................................................................................................... 1 \nChapter I -

The beams produced with different \n\nenergies in the large accelerator complex at CERN are available to numerous experiments. \n\nOne of such facilities, ISOLDE (acronym for Isotope Separator On Line Device), aims at \n\nthe production of beams of radioactive isotopes. 1,2 \n\nThe ISOLDE facility is located near the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) at \n\nCERN, which supplies the facility with a pulsed proton beam 1. The proton beam is then \n\nconducted by a series of (bending and focusing) magnets to two separate target stations. \n\nThrough this method, thick targets are bombarded with high-energy protons and nuclear \n\nreactions of spallation, fission and fragmentation occur inside the target. The reaction \n\nproducts are stopped in the bulk of the target material, diffuse out, are pumped into an ion \n\nsource and are accelerated to form a secondary radioisotope beam. Different target/ion \n\nsource units can be coupled to the ISOLDE front-ends for the production of the different \n\nradioactive ion beams (RIB). This technique is a particularly good and powerful method \n\nfor the production of pure low energy RIB. 3 To date, ISOLDE is the facility which offers \n\nthe largest number of different beams (eg. more than 1000 isobars of 73 chemical \n\nelements) in an ISOL-type facility, resulting from constant target and ion source \n\ndevelopments over the last 40 years. 2 \n\nThe targets used are made of refractory materials assembled in thick targets, such \n\nas pure metals (molten, powder, foils), oxides (powder, fibers), carbides and other \n\ncompounds. 4,5 These targets must be designed with important considerations: (i) target \n\nmaterial must be chosen to optimize the release rate (yield) of the required isotope; (ii) \n\nrapid diffusion rate is important when short lived isotopes are required, or else the nuclei \n\nwould have decayed before getting to the ionizer; for a rapid diffusion rate a high \n\ntemperature and a material with minimal diffusion lengths (like fine powder or thin foil) \n\nare required; (iii) rapid effusion rate, for example, through a material with an open internal \n\nstructure permitting the nuclei reaching the ionizer quickly; (iv) good structural strength at \n\nhigh temperatures; (v) uniform temperature in the target to prevent condensation of the \n\nrequired radioactive species and to reduce the thermal stresses in the target; this translates \n\ninto good thermal conductivity of the target material for high intensity primary beam. 6 \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nAs referred before, target operating temperatures must be as high as possible to \n\nreduce the time constants of the isotope diffusion and effusion release processes, \n\nminimizing decay losses before extraction. The maximum operating temperature is \n\nconstrained by the following requirements: (i) limited sintering to preserve the target \n\nrelease performance under pulsed and intense proton beam irradiation; (ii) reduced stable \n\nbeam contaminants coming from chemical impurities; (iii) a moderate equilibrium vapour \n\npressure (~10-2 Pa) compatible with the ion source operation. 4 \n\nAs so, the best target microstructure was defined as the one having a high porosity \n\n(>30%) in the macrosize range (>100 nm) within a narrow size distribution, nanosized \n\ngrains, and stability at high temperatures. 7,8 \n\nCalcium Oxide (CaO) targets have been successfully used at ISOLDE to produce \n\nneutron deficient exotic argon isotopes and carbon isotopes, released as CO and CO2 \n\nmolecules. Such targets outperform other related targets used to produce the same beams, \n\nsuch as MgO sintered powder or TiOx fibers. However, either some CaO target units \n\ndisplay a slow release rates from the beginning or a rapid decrease over time when \n\noperated under proton irradiation. This is believed to come from a degradation of the initial \n\nmicrostructure of the targets, caused by pre-sintering effects. 9 \n\nThe large potential of these targets, for the production of exotic isotopes and the \n\ndrawbacks detected in the release process, justifies the need to investigate the \n\nmicrostructure evolution of CaO targets, using conditions of temperature and pressure \n\nclose to that of target operation under proton irradiation and its effect on the isotope \n\ndiffusion. \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nChapter I  - State of the Art \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter I \u2013 State of the Art  \n \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nI.1 Radioactive Ion Beams \n\nRadioactivity, which was first discovered by Henri Becquerel in 1895, is the \n\nspontaneous emission of radiation by an atomic nucleus. The emitted radiation can be of \n\ndifferent types, most prominently in ascending order of penetration and descending order \n\nof energy: alpha (? - 4He nuclei) that can barely penetrate a sheet of paper, beta (?  - \n\npositrons or electrons) that can penetrate a few millimeters of aluminum and gamma (? \u2013 \n\nhigh energy photons) which can penetrate several centimeters of lead. 10 The emission of \n\nthe radioactivity from a specific nucleus can reveal much about it, depending on the types \n\nof radiation and energy. It is by this emission of radiation that the less stable nuclei get to a \n\nmore stable state, and thus this process is called decay. \n\nThe short ranged, nuclear force keeps the nucleus together, otherwise it would \n\nbreak apart due to the very large repulsive Coulomb forces between protons, which is \n\npartly compensated by the number of neutrons in the nucleus, since they experience only \n\nattractive nuclear forces. The balance between the Coulomb force and the nuclear force, or \n\nthe ratio of protons and neutrons for a certain isotope is what defines the stability of a \n\nnucleus. 10  This leads us to the question: how many nuclides exist, how many have been \n\nobserved and which ones are stable? First of all, stable nucleus and very long lived \n\nisotopes, the nuclei which \u201cnatural\u201d mater is made of, mean that a possible decay process \n\noccurs in the time scale of the universe or larger. 11 The other nuclei are called radioactive \n\nisotopes, or simply radioisotopes. \n\nIn order to study in detail nuclear subnuclear elementary particles and high energy \n\nphysics particle accelerators are continuously developed, constructed and operated. A \n\nparticle accelerator is a device in which charged particles (beam) are accelerated with \n\nelectromagnetic fields to high energies. These particles can then be sent onto a fixed target \n\nor brought to collide with another particle beam in the opposite direction. Advancements in \n\ntechnology allow to build more powerful accelerators, to study the elementary particles \n\nand their interactions. Usually, the charged particles that are accelerated are: protons, \n\nelectrons, positrons, antiprotons, ions and even unstable isotopes, which is the case of \n\nISOLDE (acronym for Isotope Separator Online Device) at CERN. 12  \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\nI.1.1 The Chart of the Nuclides \n\nThe chart of nuclides, shown in Figure I-1, displays all the presently known nuclei \n\nin a grid of proton number (Z) versus neutron number (N). There are 186 stable nuclei and \n\naround 3600 observed radioactive isotopes, although 6000 are believed to exist in total. 11 \n\nStandard databases also include for each nuclide the measured properties, among which \n\nare, relative abundance (for stable nuclides), decay modes, half-lives (for the radioactive \n\nones) and masses. 13 Databases of known nuclides and the chart itself can be found on the \n\nKarlsruher Chart 14 or on the internet in the websites of the International Atomic Energy \n\nAgency 15 and the National Nuclear Data Center 16 (both of them use several sources to \n\nkeep the data up to date). Obviously this chart is a very useful tool for physicists in these \n\nrelated fields and a good overview of what are the known nuclides and which are their \n\nproperties. \n\n \nFigure I-1 - Chart of the nuclides, where the proton, neutron and fission driplines (B p , B n , B F) can be seen. \nVertical and horizontal lines represent the magic numbers and the colors the decay modes of radioactive isotopes. \n11 \n\nIn Figure I-1, the stable nuclei (black squares) form the backbone of chart, and the \n\ncolor squares represent the radioactive isotopes (colors represent each type of decay \n\nmode). The vertical and horizontal thick lines provide the so-called magic numbers of \n\nprotons or neutrons where the nuclides are especially stable. While the N=Z line follows \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter I \u2013 State of the Art  \n \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nthe \u201cvalley of stability\u201d for light masses, this does not apply for heavy nuclei anymore: \n\nthey have more neutrons than protons. This can be explained by the increase of Coulomb \n\nforces with increasing Z as mentioned above. The neutron (Bn=0) and proton driplines \n\n(Bp=0) represent the theoretical limit at which nuclei are believed to exist. Also the \n\ntheoretical fission barrier line (BF) at which no nuclide can exist without spontaneously \n\nfission to form smaller nuclei. The white zones represent regions where nuclei are believed \n\nto exist but still unknown. The isotopes that are away from the zone of the stability of the \n\nnuclear chart have very small half-lives and are very unstable, and therefore are much \n\nmore difficult to produce and study. These are called the exotic nuclei. \n\nI.1.2 Radioactive Ion Beam Applications \n\nThe research program based in radioactive ion beams (RIB) facilities aims at \n\ndiscovering fundamental properties of nuclear structure and at explaining the nuclide chart \n\nup to the predicted frontier. This covers, for example, the precise determination of nuclear \n\nmasses, research on the properties of excited nuclear states, studies of radioactive decay \n\nmodes, the precise determination of nuclear radii, spins and moments and also the \n\ninvestigation of atomic structure of radioactive elements. Fundamental interactions are also \n\nstudied by RIBs, providing a contribution to the understanding of the Standard Model at \n\nlow energies. RIBs are as well extremely useful in other fields like in astrophysics, trying \n\nto understand the constituents and the nuclear genesis in the stars, in which the energy is \n\ngenerated though nuclear reactions amongst stable and radioactive nuclei, and which can \n\nlast for billions of years or explode in a few seconds. Life sciences are investigated with \n\nRIBs, in biochemistry and especially in the field of nuclear medicine studying the use of \n\nradioisotopes in medical diagnostics and therapy. Finally, an important field of research is \n\nsolid state physics, in which radioisotopes are implanted as probes and act as diagnostic \n\ntools to deliver information about the environment in which they are implanted. In this way \n\nthese radiotracers are used to study diffusion dynamics, surface, interface and bulk \n\nproperties, spintronics and semiconductors. 11,2 \n\nI.1.3 Production of Radioactive Ion Beams \n\nRIBs are produced by different techniques where a beam of protons, neutrons, \n\nelectrons, light or heavy ions are brought to collision with a target. 11 Several reactions and \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nbeam target combinations are used to produce the required radioactive isotopes. 17 There \n\nare 3 major types of such reactions used at CERN-ISOLDE: \n\n\u2022 Spallation - it happens when a proton with high kinetic energy (between hundreds \n\nof MeV and a few GeV) hits a target. This reaction can be described in a two-step reaction: \n\nfirst a particle is made to collide with the nucleus exciting it to a high energy state. In the \n\nsecond step, the excited nucleus emits single nucleons to lower its excitation state. This \n\nreaction is best suited to produce proton-rich isotopes, with a few protons and/or neutrons \n\nless than the original element. 18 \n\n\u2022 Fragmentation - projectile fragmentation reactions are induced by a high-energy \n\nheavy ion beam with energies above 50 MeV per nucleon. 17 It implicates heavy-ions being \n\nbroken up into lighter elements, on a target. The fragmentation reaction can also happen in \n\ntarget nuclei, when high energetic protons hit a heavy target. 18 This reaction produces a \n\nwide range of nuclei, both neutron and proton-rich, and also light nuclei.  \n\n\u2022 Fission - it happens when an incident particle, proton, neutron, electron or \n\nphotons is absorbed by the nucleus. If the incident energy is high enough, two nuclei and a \n\nnumber of free nucleons are formed. In \u201ccold fission\u201d (no neutrons or gammas are emitted) \n\na big nucleus is split in two other nucleus of smaller mass. 10 One of the produced nuclei \n\nwill have a mass of about ?, and the second of roughly ? of the mass of the original \n\nelement. 13 \n\n\u2022 Fusion-evaporation \u2013 a 4th reaction, used throughout different ISOL facilities (and \n\nnot at ISOLDE) consists on inducing two nucleus to be brought together overcoming the \n\nenergy of the Coulomb barrier. The resulting nucleus evaporates nucleons. This method \n\nproduces highly excited nuclei in the neutron-rich side of the stability region and super-\n\nheavy elements. \n\nThe nuclear reactions described above are influenced by the nature of the projectile, \n\nits energy and nature of the target. 17 To meet the demand of ever increasing RIB \n\nintensities, new accelerators that can deliver higher intensities and target systems to handle \n\nthe power deposition, resulting from the later, are under development. The production of \n\nunwanted species is often more intense compared to the desired exotic nuclei. For this, \n\nselectiveness has to be improved to separate the wanted species from the unwanted ones \n\n(contaminants). By the very definition of exotic nuclei, it is known that they have very \n\nshort half-lives. As the isotopes decay, the production and the transport from the target to \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter I \u2013 State of the Art  \n \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\nthe experimental setup has to be fast. The efficiency has also to be promoted by developing \n\nbetter ionization, acceleration and transport systems of the isotope beams. 17 \n\nThere are two methods to produce RIBs: the in-flight separation technique 19 and \n\nthe isotope separator online (ISOL) technique. Both methods transport the produced nuclei \n\nout of their production zone, where there is a large radiation background due to nuclear \n\nreactions, to a well shielded experimental setup. This has two advantages: creating low \n\nradiation background conditions for the experiment, and to purify and prepare the beam \n\nwith respect to its necessary conditions: energy, time and ion optical properties for the \n\nfollowing experiments. 17  \n\nThe ISOL technique uses production methods in a thick target, thermalization in a \n\nsolid, liquid or gas catcher, which often is the same as the target, as in the case of ISOLDE \n\nat CERN. The radioactive isotopes are then extracted from the catcher material and ionized \n\nin an ion source. After being extracted from the ion source the isotopes are mass analyzed \n\nby a dipole magnet and afterwards post-accelerated to the required energies for use in \n\nexperiments. 17 The beams resulting from this technique are of excellent ion optical quality \n\n(energy resolution, time structure and emittance) but the thermalization process described \n\nand the eventual re-acceleration slow down the delivery of isotopes and causes additional \n\nlosses for short lived isotopes. 11 \n\nBesides ISOLDE at CERN, which is a leading ISOL facility, there is also much \n\ndevelopment ongoing on other facilities like: GSI at Germany, LISOL at Belgium, IGISOL \n\nin Finland, ISAC-TRIUMF in Canada, GANIL in France, IRIS in Russia and JAERI in \n\nJapan. 17  \n\nThe quality of a RIB facility is mainly determined by the intensity and purity of its \n\nbeams. For an ISOL facility the beam intensity can be theoretically described by the \n\nexpression 20: \n\n ? = ?. ?. ?. ????. ???. ????. ?????? (I.1)  \n\nwhere i, is the beam intensity in ions per second per \u00b5A of the incident beam, ? is \n\nthe flux of the incident beam in particles per second per \u00b5A, n is the number of target \n\natoms exposed to the primary beam per unit of area and ? is the cross-section to produce \n\nthe desired isotope (cross section is considered to be the effective size of a nucleus for a \n\ncertain nuclear probabilistic reaction to happen). ?rel is the release efficiency of the target, \n\n?is is the ion source efficiency and ?sep and ?tranp are the efficiencies of the transmission of \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nthe mass separator and of the transmission to the users experimental setup, respectively \n\n(these last two efficiencies are normally close to unity). The ?rel is directly related to \n\ndiffusion through the target material and effusion through the material porosity to the ion \n\nsource.  It can be greatly improved by developing the target material. By investigating the \n\nmicrostructure and the diffusion and effusion of the isotopes on the target material, these \n\nproperties can be vastly improved and in this way, the target release efficiency would be \n\nincreased too, promoting the overall beam intensity, as will be seen later in this work. \n\nI.2 ISOLDE at CERN \n\nCERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research is the biggest \n\nexperimental laboratory center for fundamental particle physics research. It presently hosts \n\nthe LHC (Large Hadron Collider), the highest energy and largest particle accelerator in \n\noperation in the world.  CERN was founded in 1954, and it is located across the Franco-\n\nSwiss border area near Geneva and is operated by 21 member states (Portugal being one of \n\nthem). Other non-member states and organizations are also involved in the numerous \n\nexperiments taking place at CERN. CERN is a global example of successful international \n\ncollaboration for scientific interests. CERN\u2019s mission is defined in four levels: (i) \n\neducating the scientists of tomorrow; (ii) fundamental research; (iii) promoting \n\ninternational collaboration and (iv) promoting the transfer of technology. At CERN beams \n\nof particles are accelerated to high energies and are brought to collide between themselves \n\nor with targets. By doing this, scientists expect to understand better the fundamental laws \n\nof nature. 1 \n\nThe beams produced at the large accelerator complex at CERN are delivered at \n\nvarious energies to numerous experiments. One of such facilities, ISOLDE, has the aim of \n\nproducing beams of radioactive isotopes.  \n\nIt was in 1964 that ISOLDE was originally proposed at the 0.6GeV Proton-\n\nSynchro-Cyclotron (SC) at CERN. The first experiments started in 1967 and since then, \n\nthe ISOLDE facility has suffered several upgrades. Since 1989 that ISOLDE is supplied by \n\nthe 1-1.4GeV Proton-Synchrotron Booster (PSB), as Figure I-2 shows. 2 This not only \n\nprovides ISOLDE with more energetic protons but also the proton intensity was increased \n\nup to 2\u00b5A. This, together with different technological developments, increased the \n\nintensities and the number of accessible isotopes. Right now ISOLDE is the world-leading \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter I \u2013 State of the Art  \n \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\nfacility of its type, which can provide more than 1000 isotopes with half-lives down to \n\nmilliseconds out of 73 chemical elements, from Z=2 to 92, with intensities up to 1011 atoms \n\nper second. \n\n \nFigure I-2 - CERN accelerator complex. The types of beams (different colors) produced at CERN and their paths, \ncan be seen, as well as the main experiments. 1 \n\nI.2.1 Layout of ISOLDE Facility \n\nThe ISOLDE experimental facility, runs between 350 and 400 shifts of 8 hours of \n\nonline operation every year 21. The PSB supplies the ISOLDE facility (Figure I-3) with \n\nabout 30-40% of CERN\u2019s protons. The proton beam can then be redirected by a series of \n\nfocusing and bending magnets to two different front ends, which supply the fixed targets. \n\nThe protons are delivered either in pulse sharing mode, sharing the supercycle between the \n\ntwo, or individually. Some targets can have a converter that is used to transform a beam of \n\nprotons into a field of neutrons. With this technology, neutron-rich isotopes with low level \n\nof contaminants can be obtained from actinide targets. 17 \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\nWhen the high energy primary beam hits the target, spallation, fragmentation and \n\nfission reactions take place producing radioactive nuclei that are stopped (also called \n\nthermalization) in the bulk of the target material and then diffuse out of it. The isotopes \n\nthen travel through so-called processes of effusion through the transfer line to the ion \n\nsource, where they are ionized. An extraction electrode accelerates them at a potential up \n\nto 60 keV, producing the secondary beam. In the ion source, several ionization \n\nmechanisms are used, but generally singly positively or negatively charged ions are \n\nproduced 17. Usually the target, transfer line, ion-source and, if installed, the neutron \n\nconverter are referred to as the target unit or simply as target 3. \n\n \nFigure I-3 - Layout of the ISOLDE facility, describing all the steps of the process and zones. 17 \n\nTo mass analyze and separate the isotopes each target station, also called frontend, \n\nis connected to a mass separator magnet: the General Purpose Separator (GPS) or to the \n\nHigh Resolution Separator (HRS). The magnets separate the different masses according to \n\nthe Lorentzian magnetic principle 22 and both can feed a common beam distribution system \n\nwhich connects to the different experiments in the ISOLDE hall. The GPS has less \n\nresolution than the HRS, but allows for the separation and use, in parallel, of three beams \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter I \u2013 State of the Art  \n \n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\nof different masses to three different experiments at the same time. The separation of \n\ndifferent masses with HRS can provide the facility with one high resolution beam and is a \n\nmore complex system with 2 magnets with ion-optical systems for corrections. 3  \n\nSome experiments get the beam directly from the mass separators while others need \n\nthe beam to be stopped and cooled to be highly ionized and/or post accelerated. The Radio \n\nFrequency Quadrupole (RFQ) cooler, cools down the ion beam to improve its ion-optical \n\nproperties and bunches the beam. This is done to improve the peak to background ratio that \n\nis required in some experiments, or to inject the beam into the charge state breeder. The \n\ncharge state breeder is an electron beam ion source (EBIS) that changes the singly charged \n\nradioactive ions to multiple charged ion state, as required for post acceleration. Finally, the \n\nhighly ionized beam can be accelerated to several MeV per nucleon and sent to \n\nexperimental setups which require high kinetic beam energies 17. \n\nThere is big concern and legal obligation about radiological protection at ISOLDE, \n\nsince there are high amounts of radioactivity that originates from normal operation of the \n\ntargets and by the RIB itself. To comply with the legislation aiming to protect the ISOLDE \n\ngroup and its users, who have to use a dosimeter on the ISOLDE experimental hall, the \n\nstrong radioactive target zone is completely separated from the hall. It has dedicated \n\nventilation, is separately pumped and is highly shielded with steel, concrete blocks and 8m \n\nof soil. The targets are manipulated, stored and changed by industrial robots without the \n\nneed for human physical presence. The target zone is also equipped with a class A \n\nradioactive laboratory to safely and correctly handle any radioactive materials. 3 After the \n\nirradiation and operation time, the targets are disposed as radioactive waste. 23 \n\nAn important part of the ISOLDE infrastructure is made of beam diagnostics, since \n\nit permits the delivery of good quality RIB to the physics experiments. Part of these \n\ninstruments, are the wire scanners and grids that permit to see the position and the profile \n\nof the beam, faraday cups that measure the overall intensity of the beam in several \n\npositions along the beam line, tape stations through which we can measure the release rates \n\n(yields) and obtain the release curve of radioactive isotopes. There are gamma detectors \n\nthat allow the identification of the produced isotopes through a gamma spectrum. Some of \n\nthese instruments will be described in larger detail later, in the experimental procedure \n\nchapter (see section II.7). \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\nFurthermore, the operation of the entire ISOLDE facility, from the vacuum \n\nsystems, to the beam distribution system and diagnostics, and all target parameters, with \n\nexception of the experiments, is done in the control room, by several computers and other \n\ncontrol systems in a user friendly environment. 3 \n\nI.2.2 Target Unit \n\nThe heart of an on-line isotope separator is its target and ion source. The \n\nperformance of these components is an essential part for the delivery of high quality beams \n\nin a facility like ISOLDE. Yearly, in average, ISOLDE produces 30 target units with \n\ntypical utilization from 24h to 300h with an average of 64h 23. Around 30 different target \n\nmaterials, 5 transfer lines and 5 types of ion-sources are available at ISOLDE, making \n\nnearly 100 different possible combinations, which are chosen depending on the required \n\nradioactive ion beams. The targets can be either made of solid or liquid materials. \n\n  \nFigure I-4 \u2013 Target unit MK7 with VADIS ion source in 3D (a) and cut (b) \u2013 courtesy of Stefano Marzari. The \nnumbers indicate the target container (1), the transfer line (2) and the ion source (3). The arrow indicates how the \nproton beam is made to collide with the target material, which is inside the target container. \n\nAs can be seen in Figure I-4, the ISOLDE standard target container has a \n\ncylindrical shape (200mm long, 20mm of diameter) and is made of tantalum, a refractory \n\nmetal, which is then filled with the target material. To enhance the diffusion and effusion \n\nprocesses the target container can be heated by ohmic resistance up to 2200oC by providing \n\na) b) \n\n1 \n\n1 \n2 \n\n3 \n\n2 \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter I \u2013 State of the Art  \n \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\na current up to 1000A. As referred, a neutron field can be made by redirecting the proton \n\nbeam to hit tantalum or tungsten rods, that are usually below the target (not present in the \n\nfigure), serving as neutron converters. \n\nThe electrical connectors in both ends of the target container are specially designed \n\nto accommodate the thermal expansion of the target during its operation, reducing the \n\nmechanical stress on the target unit. The transfer line is the only opening of the target \n\ncontainer through which the produced isotopes effuse to the ion source. By inserting cold \n\nparts into the hot transfer line some elements can be actively condensed or selectively \n\nadsorbed, providing a way to chemically select the reaction products that come out of the \n\ntarget.  \n\nAnother very important part of the target unit is its ion source. Different ion sources \n\ncan be mounted on the target for the best ionization efficiency, depending on the isotope to \n\nbe ionized and its best ionization mechanism: (i) surface ionization, for elements with low \n\nionization potential or high electrical affinity (for negative ion sources); (ii) plasma \n\nionization, with a large efficiency but no selectivity; or (iii) resonant laser ionization for \n\nselective ionization of metallic elements. 24  \n\nI.2.3 ISOLDE Pulse Shape \n\nAs soon as the proton beam hits the target, the isotopes produced through nuclear \n\nreactions, diffuse out of the material grains and desorb from the surface. Then, the species \n\neffuse through the porosity of the material (hitting the walls and being possibly adsorbed \n\nagain) to the transfer line and then to the ion source where they are ionized. 25,26 The \n\nisotope release from the target after proton impact shows a sharp rise and a sudden fall, \n\nending with a tail (see Figure I-5). The release can be defined as a probability function, \n\np(t), also called release curve or delay curve. To mathematically describe this behavior a \n\nthree exponential function was chosen: 25  \n\n ?(?) =\n1\n\n????\n?1 ? ??????. ??????? + (1 ? ?)?????? (I.2)  \n\nwhere t is the time, and ?r (rise), ?f (fast fall) and ?s (slow fall) are three time-constant: \n\n ?? =\nln 2\n??\n\n (I.3)  \n\n? is a weighting factor between the slow and fast fallings components. In order to compare \n\nthe release figures and their time constants, the integral of this function is normalized \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\n(Norm) to 1. The fit function of equation (I.2) describes numerically the experimental \n\ncurves, and its time parameters are not easily linked to specific physical phenomena. \n\n \nFigure I-5 - Theoretical release curve, where final release curve display a fast and a slow component (courtesy of \nAlexander Gottberg). \n\nThe intensity curve is calculated by multiplying equation (I.2) per N0 which \n\ncorresponds to the number of isotopes produced at t=0 (proton impact). The total yield is \n\nthen calculated from the area under release intensity curve normalized to the proton current \n\n(ions/\u00b5C). 25 \n\nTo characterize the release characteristics, a useful parameter is the release \n\nefficiency (?rel). It is defined by the probability (dependent on half-life) that a certain \n\nisotope has to be released out of the target 27. The release efficiency depends on each \n\nmaterial, its respective operation temperature and of the target unit geometry. The release \n\nefficiency is lower for short-lived isotopes and approaches 1 for longer lived ones, since \n\nduring effusion and diffusion delay processes part of what was produced, after the proton \n\nimpact, is lost. The release efficiency is function of the isotope half-life (T1/2) and is \n\nderived from equation (I.2) by the following relation: \n\n ??????1 2? ? = ? ??(?)?\n?ln2?1/2\n\n??\n\n0\n?? (I.4)  \n\nwhere p?(t) corresponds to the release (equation (I.2)) for isotopes with T1/2??, giving: \n\n ??????1 2? ? =\n1\n\n????\n?\n\n?\n?? + ??\n\n+\n(1 ? ?)\n?? + ??\n\n+\n??\n\n?? + ?? + ??\n+\n\n(? ? 1)\n?? + ?? + ??\n\n? (I.5)  \n\nwhere ?i  is the isotope decay constant: \n\n ?? =\nln 2\n?1/2\n\n (I.6)  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter I \u2013 State of the Art  \n \n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\nI.3 Target Materials \n\nFor more than 40 years target materials have been developed at ISOLDE searching \n\nconstantly for fast release properties in order to promote the production of exotic nuclei. 9 \n\nDifferent materials are used as ISOLDE targets either in solid or liquid state. The materials \n\nin solid state can be shaped as pressed pills, powders, fibers or foils of metals, carbides or \n\noxides. The liquid targets are made of metals or salts of low melting points. Details about \n\nsome of these materials can be seen in Table I-1. \nTable I-1- Table with target materials most used at ISOLDE: T m  is the melting point temperature, T max  is the \nmaximum operation temperature, p vap  is the vapor pressure, ? is the theoretical density and ? is the target \nthickness. 28 \n\nType Material \nT m \n\n(oC) \nT max \n(oC) \n\np vap \nPa \n\n? \n(g/cm3) \n\n? \n(g/cm2) \n\nTypical Isotopes \n\nM\net\n\nal\n \n\nSn (l) 232 1100 6x10-3 5.5 110 60-74Zn, 64-75Ga \nLa (l) 920 1400 10-2 6.2 124 114-137Cs, 122-138Ba \nPb (l) 328 800 10-1 10.1 200 177-207Hg \n\nTi 1675 1600 2x10-1 4.5 25 37-46Ca,42-48Sc \nNb 2610 2050 3x10-4 8.6 50 70-85Br, 70-85Kr, 74-86Rb, 76-87Sr, 79-89Y \nTa 2996 2200 5x10-5 16.6 110 many \n\nC\nar\n\nbi\nde\n\ns SiC 2300\n* 1200 \u2020 3.2 21 17-23F, 18-24Ne, 20-24Na, 22-28Mg \n\nLaC2 ? 1750 2x10\n-1 5.0 ~30 98-Cd, 100-114In, 104-Sn, 114-138Cs \n\nThC2 ~2450 2200 2x10\n-3 9.0 ~50 many \n\nUC2 ~2450 2200 2x10\n-2 11.3 ~50 many \n\nO\nxi\n\nde\ns \n\nMgO 2800 1500 5x10-1 3.6 2.9 17-24Ne \nCaO 2898 1400 ~10-2 3.3 5 6He, 10C, 17N, 18-19Ne, 33-35Ar, 41-46Ar \nZrO 2 2700 1850 ~10\n\n-2 5.9 6 Mn, Zn, Se, Kr, 56,71Cu, 62-74Ga \nLa 2O 3 2300 1300 ~10\n\n-2 6.5 64\u2021 115-125Xe \nCeO 2 2600 1300&lt;10\n\n-2 7.1 16 112-125Xe, etc. \nThO 2 3050 2100 2x10\n\n-2 9.9&lt;30 many \n \n\nMetals are used in form of foils or powders, creating target densities near one third \n\nof the bulk density. These forms are used to keep diffusion lengths short. Furthermore, \n\ndiffusion in solid metals is slow for some elements so, often, oxides or carbides are \n\npreferred where higher temperatures can be applied. Although carbides are very stable, \n\nthey are limited in operation temperatures by their vapor pressures or their level of \n\nimpurities. The advantages and disadvantages of oxides are explained later in this work. 28 \n\nBeyond solid targets, molten targets are also used at ISOLDE. These have a slightly \n\ndifferent way of operation. They operate with larger pulse structure (3 bunches separated \n                                                 \n* Decomposition temperature \n\u2020 Impurity limited \n\u2021 400mm long target \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\nby 16\u00b5s, instead of the normal set of 4 bunches separated by ~90ns) of the primary beam, \n\nthat generate shockwaves in the molten material, promoting the release of the isotopes. 29 \n\nThese targets produce RIBs of higher intensities of not too shorted-lived isotopes, due to \n\ntheir high densities. 28 \n\nA solid material must fulfill several requirements to be selected as a target material \n\nfor the production of RIBs at CERN-ISOLDE.  The most important requirements and the \n\nones that contribute more to the isotope release are the diffusion, effusion and adsorption. \n\nFor ISOL applications the best target microstructure was described before as the \n\none having high open porosity (>30%) in the macrosize range (>100nm), nanosized grains, \n\nand stability at high temperatures. 7 Tortuosity should be minimized, and the pore size \n\ndistribution must be narrow, minimizing the resistance to gaseous flow (effusion). 7,8  \n\nAdditionally, the surface area is a very important parameter to control. Nanometric \n\nscale materials with high surface area are envisaged, since not only diffusion lengths are \n\nshortened but also the release surface is increased. Nevertheless, a high surface area \n\nnanometric material will sinter at lower temperatures. Therefore, the temperature effect \n\nover time on the microstructure has to be well known (e.g. through sintering kinetics) in \n\norder to operate the target with temperatures high enough to promote diffusion and \n\neffusion phenomena but not degrade the microstructure of the material. \n\nThe production method of the target material defines the target final properties: \n\ndifferent methods lead to different microstructures and different material properties.  \n\nIn this section the most important properties will be described as well as their \n\nrelation to the release process. \n\nI.3.1 Diffusion \n\nAs diffusion remains one of the most important and most limiting factors involved \n\nin release properties from an ISOLDE target, it will be further detailed. \n\nFick\u2019s first law (in one dimension) is the simplest way of describing diffusion, for \n\nsteady concentration conditions of the diffusing species: 30 \n\n ?? = ??\n??\n??\n\n (I.7)  \n\nwhere Jx is the flux of the diffusing species, dC/dx is the concentration gradient and D is \n\nthe diffusion coefficient. When concentration varies with time Fick\u2019s second law (also in \n\none dimension) applies instead: 30 \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter I \u2013 State of the Art  \n \n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\n ??\n??\n\n= ?\n?2?\n??2\n\n (I.8)  \n\nThese laws can be used to determine the diffusion coefficient of a diffusing element \n\nin a host lattice from experimental data. To this end, a usual technique consists in the \n\nimplantation of a radioactive isotope in a sample. Then, by heating at fixed temperatures \n\nfor different delays, the diffusion coefficients can be determined as well as the diffusion \n\npre-exponential factor (D0) and the activation energy (Q). \n\nI.3.1.1 Main Diffusion Mechanisms \n\nThe mechanisms of diffusion are the paths that the atoms preferably move in the \n\ncrystal lattice. These are mainly influenced by the types of defects present in the material \n\ncrystal lattice. The three principal mechanisms are: lattice diffusion (or volume or bulk \n\ndiffusion), grain boundary diffusion, and surface diffusion. 30 \n\nLattice diffusion can occur either from a vacancy or by interstitial mechanism. \n\nOther mechanisms like interstitialcy and direct exchange (or ring mechanism) can also \n\nhappen. Vacancies are part of the equilibrium point defects so they are always present in \n\nthe material 31. Their movement is in the opposite direction and the motion equivalent to \n\nthat of the atom. The concentration of vacancies is determined by the temperature, solute \n\nand atmosphere. Another important mechanism is defined by atoms small enough to travel \n\nin the interstitial sites of the crystal lattice, which are said to move through the interstitial \n\nmechanism. Less important, interstitialcy mechanism happens when the distortion of the \n\nlattice is too large for the interstitial diffusion to happen. So a neighboring atom exchanges \n\nposition with a lattice atom. The later, direct exchange or ring mechanism is defined by \n\nrotation of a group of atoms without participation of a defect. 30 \n\nThe grain boundaries of polycrystalline material are highly defective zones by \n\nnature. Because of that, grain boundaries are often zones of faster diffusion. This type of \n\ndiffusion is dependent on the grain size, since higher grain sizes have reduced grain \n\nboundaries areas. 30 \n\nSurface diffusion happens because the free surface of a solid is a perturbed region \n\nwhere kinks, edges, terraces and also vacancies and adatoms are formed. The migration of \n\nthose last two is what provides the main mechanism of surface diffusion. 30 \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\nI.3.1.2 Factors Influencing Diffusion \n\nThe diffusion coefficient depends greatly on the diffusing species, their \n\nconcentration and the host material 31,32 and consequently on the diffusion mechanism 31.  \n\nThe temperature has a large influence on the diffusion coefficients and diffusion \n\nrates. The diffusion coefficient varies with the temperature following an Arrhenius \n\nequation: 32 \n\n ? = ?0?????\n?\n??\n\n? (I.9)  \n\nwhere D0 is the temperature independent pre-exponential factor, Q is the activation energy \n\nfor the diffusion (both dependent on the host material and diffusion species), R is the \n\nuniversal gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. \n\nThe type of the crystal phase (or lattice) of the host material is important in terms of \n\natomic packing factor. For example, a face-centered cubic crystalline system has an atomic \n\npacking factor higher (0.74) than the body-centered one (0.68) so, typically, for the same \n\nhost and diffusion species the diffusion coefficient is higher in the case of the later, \n\nbecause the atoms can move more freely. 31 \n\nDiffusion is also influenced by defects present in the material crystal lattice. These \n\ndefects influence transport phenomena, affecting for instance the rates sintering. 33 Proton \n\nirradiation is known to induce defects on the crystal structure such as voids, flaws and \n\npoint defects, and this may affect the release processes by promoting diffusion 34. Since at \n\nISOLDE the proton beam is pulsed, this will induce high temperature spikes due to the \n\ndeposited energy. These high temperatures, together with the temperature set in the target \n\ncontainer, promote the annealing and sintering of the material. Therefore the best \n\nconditions in terms of temperature and proton intensity are those for which the \n\nmicrostructure is stable, defining the release properties achieved in operation over time. \n\nOnly a post irradiation study would reveal the precise influence of all of these factors on \n\nthe material microstructure 34. \n\nI.3.1.3 Diffusion and ISOLDE Release Curve \n\nAnalyzing the ISOLDE release curve it is possible to obtain meaningful physical \n\nparameters about the release characteristics of the target material and also about the \n\nsurrounding geometric components of the target. Effusion and diffusion time constants can \n\nbe obtained through the release curve by using a model first proposed by R. Kirchner 27. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter I \u2013 State of the Art  \n \n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\nThis model defines the probability of a given isotope to diffuse out of the material grains \n\nand effuse through the material porosity and to the ion source. \n\nThe effusion delay function, pv(t), can be defined analogously to the evacuation of \n\na certain volume through an opening, which can be described by an exponential function 27: \n\n ??(?) = ????? (I.10)  \n\nwhere v is an effusion delay parameter. The diffusion delay function, p\u00b5(t), was derived \n\nfrom Fick\u2019s Law for infinite foils of thickness d: \n\n ?\u00b5(?) =\n8?\n?2\n\n? ???(2?+1)\n2?\n\n?\n\n?=0\n\n (I.11)  \n\nwhere \u00b5 is the diffusion delay parameter, which can be related to a diffusion coefficient \n\n(D): \n\n ? =\n?2?\n?2\n\n (I.12)  \n\nBy a convolution of effusion and diffusion (equations (I.10) and (I.11)) the \n\nfollowing equation, for the geometry of infinite foils, is obtained 27: \n\n ?(?) =\n8??\n?2\n\n?\n???? ? ???(2?+1)\n\n2?\n\n?(2? + 1)2 ? ?\n\n?\n\n?=0\n\n (I.13)  \n\nE. Bouquerel et al. 35 developed a more accurate equation for effusion delay \n\nfunction in an ISOLDE target unit by adding a second exponential function, to account for \n\neffusion of atoms from the target container to the ion source through a transfer line:  \n\n ??1,?2(?) =\n1\n\n????\n(1 ? ???2?)???1? (I.14)  \n\nwhere v1 and v2 are effusion time parameters.

Yprod , which is only mass dependent, \n\ncan be obtained through simulations with programs like ABRABLA 38,39. So, ?rel can be \n\nobtained through the equation: \n\n ???? =\n????\n\n????????\n (I.20)  \n\nwhere ?is is the ion source efficiency. From this using the release efficiency equation, \n\ndeduced similarly to equation (I.5), from equation (I.16), just for diffusion, \u00b5 can be known \n\n27: \n\n ???? =\n 3????2/? \u00d7 tanh???2/? ? 1?\n\n??2/?\n (I.21)  \n\nThis method is less accurate and underestimates \u00b5 since losses due to effusion are \n\nneglected. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter I \u2013 State of the Art  \n \n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\nAttempts to calculate the diffusion parameters and constants and/or activation \n\nenergies from the detailed models have been successful in various works 27,35,36,40,41. \n\nI.3.2  Effusion \n\nAfter the isotope diffuses out of the target, effusion processes are responsible for \n\ntransporting the isotope of interest to the ion source. Effusion can be defined as the \n\nmolecular dynamics where a gas molecule doesn\u2019t hit another gas molecule. Effusion is \n\nmostly dependent on the temperature and on the target surface physico-chemical \n\nproperties.   \n\nThe effusion step is also dependent on the following parameters 27: (i) the average \n\nnumber of collisions of the isotope with the surface of the target or the surrounding \n\nmaterials until it is ionized; (ii) the average sticking time in each wall collision, which is \n\nmainly  dependent on the temperature and on the adsorption enthalpy of the target material \n\nor surrounding materials; (iii) and also the average flight time between each wall collision. \n\nThe defined parameters are very dependent on the type of materials that are chosen \n\nfor the target unit. Furthermore, by increasing the temperature and reducing the total \n\nvolume of the target the effusion speed is enhanced 7.  \n\nI.3.3 Other Important Material Requirements \n\nBesides fast diffusion and effusion, other important characteristics for a target \n\nmaterial must be considered and they are as S. Fernandes 7 described: high production \n\ncross section, high operational temperature, high resistance to radiation damage, high \n\nthermal conductivity and high resistance to fatigue, creep, thermal shock and corrosion. \n\nA high isotope production cross section is related to the target material, the primary \n\nbeam energy and is the probabilistic event of a certain nuclear reaction to occur. The \n\namount of material exposed to the beam can be increased, increasing the production rate. 5 \n\nOne of the most important properties is the refractory characteristics of the \n\nmaterial. A high operational temperature is required to reduce the time constants of the \n\ndiffusion and effusion, and usually, the target temperature is set a few hundred degrees \n\nbelow the material melting point 4. The maximum temperature is constrained by the \n\nevaporation of the target material and/or its impurities, degradation and sintering effects. \n\nThe temperature is also limited by the vapor pressure of the material, which has to be \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n26 \n\n \n\ncompatible with the ion source (less than 10-2 Pa), from which the ion source efficiency \n\nstarts to fall 4. \n\nDue to exposition of the target to high levels of radiation, high resistance to \n\nradiation damage of the material is needed. Radiation can induce changes in the physico-\n\nchemical characteristics (atomic, microstructural and electric, thermo-mechanical \n\nproperties). These effects are dependent on the type, energy and the dose of particles which \n\nirradiates the material, its impurities, the surrounding atmosphere and temperature. Target \n\ndeterioration by radiation is not a simple time effect. It mainly depends on the intensity of \n\nthe beam, but on the bunch characteristics, which is deleterious for the target 20. \n\nBoth target material and target container must have a high thermal conductivity and \n\nhigh emissivity. When the primary beam pulse collides with the target, some fraction of \n\nenergy is deposited in the target and in the target container, generating loads of high \n\ntemperature in the target. Efficient cooling systems and good thermal conductance between \n\nthe target and the container are needed for preserving the mechanical integrity of the target \n\nand also its microstructure. 5 \n\nHigh resistance to fatigue, creep, thermal shock and corrosion is needed since the \n\ntarget is subjected to thermal gradients induced by the pulsed proton irradiation and ohmic \n\nresistance heating, thus requiring a high fatigue resistance. Fracture failure of the target can \n\nbe induced by creep and corrosion in the target material. \n\nI.4 Calcium Oxide Nanopowders \n\nSince the early days of ISOLDE that ceramic powders or loose compacts have been \n\nused as target materials; firstly hydroxides (1970) 42, then oxides and carbides (1975) and \n\nlater borides (1986) 43, since higher target temperatures could be reached. \n\nCalcium oxide (CaO) has been used at ISOLDE for a long time, providing good \n\nyields of argon isotopes. Around 1 to 2 CaO targets are produced every year, representing \n\n3.3% of the total ISOLDE RIB time \u2013 data from the last 5 years 44. \n\nAlkaline earth materials are known for the production of good yields of noble gas \n\nisotopes through spallation nuclear reactions. 42 Calcium oxide is too corrosive to be used \n\nas a target material at high temperature directly in a tantalum (Ta) container, so it\u2019s \n\ncovered, therefore protected, by a rhenium (Re) foil 43. Submitted at high temperatures \n\n(>1050oC), it gives fast release of some of the elements. Proton induced reactions of \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter I \u2013 State of the Art  \n \n\n \n\n27 \n\n \n\nspallation and fragmentation mainly produce the isotopes as showed from the ABRABLA \n\nsimulation plot of Figure I-6 a). \n\nThis target is operated with a Versatile Arc Discharge Ion Source (VADIS) plasma \n\nion source which is especially designed for the production of noble gas RIBs, when \n\ncoupled via a cold transfer line (cooled by water) in order to trap condensable elements and \n\nimprove the chemical selectivity 43. The yields provided by the different CaO target units \n\ncan vary by more than one order of magnitude, only the best historical values at ISOLDE \n\nare shown in Figure I-6 b). \n\n \n\n \nFigure I-6 \u2013 (a) Simulation of the ISOLDE in-target isotope production yields for calcium oxide material with a \nthickness of 7g/cm2 done with ABRABLA. (b) Best historical experimental yields obtained by the CaO target \nmaterial at ISOLDE. The filled marks were measured at the actual ISOLDE installations (PSB), the unfilled \nmarks were measured in the old ISOLDE installation near the SC. 45 \n\nAt ISOLDE, as referred in the Introduction, CaO targets outperform other target \n\nmaterial to produce similar beams but the material degrades in operation, either showing \n\nlow yields from the beginning or a decrease over time. This effect is believed to be either \n\ndue to sintering effects on the material due to high operation temperatures, to the proton \n\npulses, or both. \n\n1E+0\n\n1E+2\n\n1E+4\n\n1E+6\n\n1E+8\n\n1E+10\n\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\n\nY p\nro\n\nd \n(io\n\nns\n/\u00b5\n\nC)\n \n\nMass Number \n\nArgon Isotopes\n\nNeon Isotopes\n\nCarbon Isotopes\n\n1E+0\n\n1E+2\n\n1E+4\n\n1E+6\n\n1E+8\n\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\n\nYi\nel\n\nd \n(io\n\nns\n/\u00b5\n\nC)\n \n\nMass Number \n\nArgon PSB\n\nCarbon PSB\n\nHelium PSB\n\nNeon PSB\n\nArgon SC\n\nCarbon SC\n\nHelium SC\n\nNitrogen SC\n\nNeon SC\n\na) \n\nb) \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n28 \n\n \n\nSince CaO, as a target material, has never been characterized at ISOLDE, and the \n\nreduction of the grain size of other materials has been proved to enhance their release \n\nproperties 8,7, the state of the art of calcium oxide nanopowders in terms of its production, \n\nreactivity in air and thermal behavior, is presented in the following sections, in order to \n\nprovide a background for this study. \n\nI.4.1 General Characteristics \n\nCalcium oxide (CaO) is a white, refractory and alkaline crystalline solid at room \n\ntemperature 46. The Table I-2 summarizes the general characteristics of calcium oxide. \nTable I-2 \u2013 General characteristics of calcium oxide. 47 \n\nMolar weight 56.007g/mol \nPhysical form Crystalline, cubic \n\nColor Gray-white \nMelting point 2898oC \n\nDensity 3.34g/cm3 \nVapor Pressure 48 1.49x10-6Pa (1500oC) \nCrystal System 48 \nSpace Group 48 \n\nLattice constants 48 \n\nCubic (NaCl) \nOh\n\n5 \u2013 Fm3m \na=0.4799nm \n\nReactivity \n\nReacts violently with water forming calcium hydroxide. \nSoluble in acid solutions. \nReacts with carbon forming carbide. 48 \nReacts with CO2 forming calcium carbonate.\n\n 48 \n \n\nThe calcium oxide (CaO) also called lime, calcia, quicklime or unslaked lime, has \n\nmany uses in the current industrial world such as in mortars and cements, in the \n\nmanufacturing of steel, plastic and glass, in food processing such as sugar refining, in \n\ndisinfecting and disease control, in many chemical processes, as an absorbent, in water \n\ntreatment, air pollution control as in flue-gas desulfuration and in agriculture for soil \n\nconditioning. 49,46  \n\nNanocrystalline CaO is also used, since its large specific surface and high \n\ninterfacial energies have superior material properties required to improve the performance \n\nin many applications, especially in applications as catalysts, sensors and oxide dispersion \n\nstrengthened alloys. 50  \n\nCaO, as powder, is also very interesting as a target for proton irradiation for isotope \n\nproduction through the ISOL method, as referred before. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter I \u2013 State of the Art  \n \n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\nI.4.2 Calcination \n\nThe production of CaO through the decomposition of calcium carbonate (CaCO3, \n\ncalcite) has been object of study for the past 100 years 51. The chemical decomposition \n\nreactions are within the most common solid state reactions. A different solid gas phases are \n\nproduced by heating up another solid, producing simple oxides from carbonates, \n\nhydroxides, nitrates, sulphates and other metal salts. 30 The calcination, lately generalized \n\nto the chemical reaction between solids or decomposition of solids through heating, is the \n\ndecomposition of the calcium carbonate, by supplying heat, into calcium oxide (CaO) and \n\ncarbon dioxide (CO2): \n\n ????3 ? ??? + ??2 (I.22)  \n\nBy having a look into the reaction thermodynamics, in Eq. (I.22), it is known that \n\nthe reaction is strongly endothermic, because the calculated standard enthalpy of the \n\nreaction is high and positive, ?Ho R=42.6kcal/mol 52. From the calculation of the Gibbs free \n\nenergy change from the reaction, the temperature at which the CaCO3 begins to become \n\nunstable can be known. Equivalent information can be taken from data of the partial \n\npressure of the gaseous product \u2013 CO2 (???2).  \n\n \nFigure I-7 - Standard free energy of a reaction in function of the temperature. The dashed lines represent the \nequilibrium of the gas pressure above the reactions. 30 \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\nA graphic representation of the variation of the Gibbs free energy with temperature \n\nand the equilibrium gas pressure can be seen in Figure I-7. This figure is a very important \n\ntheoretical asset for this work since from it, one can assess the theoretical temperature at \n\nwhich the CaCO3 starts to decompose at a specific partial pressure of CO2. This can be \n\ndone by drawing a vertical line which intercepts the point where the CaCO3 reaction line \n\nmeets the dashed line of the determined ???2. It can be seen that, for the decomposition in \n\nair, the reaction starts at ~800oC, whereas for reduced CO2 pressures, lower temperatures \n\nare required. For instances, when ???2=10\n-7atm (10-2 Pa) the reaction is shifted to ~610oC.  \n\nTo achieve the desired properties and a high quality oxide product, a precise control \n\nof the CaCO3 thermal decomposition is necessary.  The characteristics of the precursor, \n\nsuch as the particle size, porosity, purity, calcination temperature, holding time and CO2 \n\npressure all influence the final characteristics of the synthetized CaO. 49 An understanding \n\nof these factors along with their influence on the kinetics of the reaction is, therefore, \n\nimportant and has been undertaken in various works which will be reviewed here. \n\n \nFigure I-8 - Representation of the CaCO3  decomposition and the formation of the porous layer of CaO.\n\n 30 \n\nIn this heterogeneous reaction, as the molar volume of the solid reaction product \n\n(CaO) is less than the one of the reactant (CaCO3), the product forms a porous layer \n\naround the nonporous reactant core, which interface moves inward 30. This is also called \n\nthe calcination shrinking core model, illustrated in Figure I-8 53. The kinetics of the \n\nreaction can be either controlled by the reaction at the interface between the CaO and the \n\nCaCO3, by heat transfer to the reaction or gas diffusion (or permeation) from the reaction \n\nsurface through the porous product layer 30. \n\nThe difference between the molar volumes indicates that the CaO should have a \n\nporosity around ~55% for the CaO produced from CaCO3 and around 50% for the one \n\nproduced from Ca(OH)2, but slightly lower porosities (~15% less) in both cases were \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter I \u2013 State of the Art  \n \n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\nobtained by D. Beruto et al. 54. This means that the calcite particle aggregates must \n\nexperience some shrinkage due to sintering effects during the decomposition step 55. This \n\ncan either be due to sintering of CaCO3 before or of CaCO3/CaO during the \n\ndecomposition, or both 56,57. \n\nThrough the last decades an effort has been made to understand the kinetics, \n\nmechanism, and the rate limiting step of the decomposition reactions under different \n\nconditions to create adequate kinetic models. However, no agreement among authors has \n\nbeen reached, specifically in the case of the decomposition reactions to obtain CaO, which \n\nis by far the most studied one. 49,58 Studies on the decomposition of CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 \n\npowders or large single crystals in some various atmospheres, have been made, as \n\nsummarized in the Table I-3. \n\nThe kinetics of the CaCO3 decomposition follows a linear law accordingly to the \n\ngeometrical model of the contracting thickness: 30 \n\n ? = ??? (I.23)  \n\nwhere w is the weight loss, kr is the rate constant and t is the time. This relation is verified \n\nexperimentally in several works 49,51,58-61. 49,51,58,59,60,61 \n\nI.4.2.1 Effect of the Atmosphere and Temperature \n\nIn 1958, D. Glasson 56 first reported that CaO produced through decomposition of \n\nmicrometric CaCO3 powders in vacuum yielded higher surface areas than in air. It is by \n\ncreating non-equilibrium conditions that the reaction of the equation (I.22) is shifted to the \n\nright hand side promoting the fast nucleation of CaO 57 and thus the formation of very \n\nsmall crystallites. Several other studies, resumed in Table I-3, report the obtainment of \n\nnanocrystalline CaO and decomposition reactions happening at much lower temperatures \n\nthan the decomposition in air. For example, D. Beruto et al. 54 reported complete \n\ndecomposition of CaCO3 micrometric powder (3 to 10 \u00b5m) at only 510oC under 7x10-4 Pa \n\n(7x10-9 atm), to give 15 nm crystallites of CaO with 78 m2/g of specific surface area. This \n\nis coherent with Figure I-7, where thermodynamically, for ???2=10\n-8 atm) the reaction \n\nhappens at less than 600oC. Furthermore, E. Powell and A. Searcy 61 report decreasing \n\nsurface areas for increasing temperatures of decomposition. \n\nIn most of the studies, the obtained CaO crystallites are too small to be analyzed by \n\nSEM and the characterization of CaO powders for Transmission Electron Microscopy \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\n(TEM) is difficult mostly due to the powder instability in air atmosphere 61. K. Towe 64, A. \n\nSingh et al. 50 and C. Rodriguez-Navarro et al. 49, could analyze the nanostructured CaO by \n\ndecomposing CaCO3 in situ in a Transmission Electron Microscope, with the electron \n\nbeam under vacuum. The type of used energy to decompose the CaCO3 (electron \n\nirradiation or heat) was reported to have not a significant influence on the decomposition \n\nmechanism. 49 K. Towe 64 and C. Rodrigez-Navarro et al. 49 observed rod-shaped \n\nnanocrystallites with preferred orientations, produced from large calcite single crystals, \n\nwith dimensions of about 10x100 nm and 5-10x25-75 nm, respectively. The later could \n\nalso determine the pore size, from 5 to 10 nm. A. Singh et al. 50, instead of using large \n\ncalcite crystals, as in the previous studies, used a calcite micrometric powder and observed \n\nplate-like nanocrystals of calcia with 5-10 nm and preferred orientations. \nTable I-3 \u2013 Summary of precursors form, calcinations conditions and CaO powders characteristics reported in the \nopen literature. \n\nAuthor Raw material T (\u00baC) Atmosphere \nSSA \n\n(m2/g) \nXS \n\n(nm) \n\nD.

He also reported that \n\nsintering happened already at 650oC, for 1200Pa of CO2 pressure, and the resulting CaO \n\nparticles showed coalescence, dimpling and rounding. The effect of CO2 in sintering will \n\nbe better detailed ahead. \n\nDecomposition of CaCO3 under N2 atmospheres showed microstructures and \n\nmorphologies identical to those observed in air decomposition. These microstructures \n\nshowed rounded grains and coalescence between them. This was observed by J. Ewing, D. \n\nBeruto 63, M. Maciejewski and R. Oswald 57. The former attributes this result to the partial \n\nincrease of the CO2 pressure in the decomposition atmosphere up to values comparable to \n\nthose attained in air decomposition. \n\nI.4.2.2 Influence of the Precursor \n\nCalcium oxide has been obtained by decomposition of micrometric powders of \n\nCa(OH)2 and CaCO3 in vacuum by D. Glasson 56 and D. Beruto et al. 54 They both report \n\nhigher surface areas in the case of decomposition of Ca(OH)2 comparing with the \n\ndecomposition of CaCO3. Furthermore, D. Beruto et al. 54 reported that the reaction is \n\npseudomorphous for the decomposition of both precursors. This author obtained calcia \n\nparticles with different porosities for different precursors (higher in case of decomposition \n\nfrom CaCO3, because the molar volume of water is less that the molar volume of CO2. \n\nIn other study done by D. Beruto and A. Searcy 60 the morphology of the obtained \n\ncalcia particles from calcite large single crystals as precursors, was studied. Two \n\nmicrostructures were reported to be present in the obtained CaO crystals: an inner layer of \n\nabout 10 to 50 \u00b5m, made of rods typically separated from their neighbors by very small \n\npores, and an outer layer where the rods are typically collapsed into bundles of ~1 \u00b5m \n\ncross section separated by ~1 \u00b5m pores. This indicates that the outer layer, which is an \n\nopen structure of the inner unbundled rods, is mechanically unstable and that strains can be \n\ninduced in it. It is thought that this strain is due to the low mobility of the CaO species in \n\nthe reaction interface. 58 The transition between the two layers lead to changes in the pore \n\nsize and distribution as suggested by E. Powel and A. Searcy 61 and later proved by D. \n\nBeruto 62:  the transition happens, when the intermediate layer has more than ~10 \u00b5m, by \n\ndifusionless repacking into bundles, reducing the surface area and creating a duplex pore \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n34 \n\n \n\nstructure, with the larger pores being in the micrometric range. A consequence of this type \n\nof structure, with bimodal pore-size distribution, is that by heating, coarsening with very \n\nlittle shrinkage is observed, with decrease in the mesopore* volume being balanced by \n\nincrease in the macropore* volume 65. \n\nIn the case of decomposition of micrometric calcite particles, no macropores are \n\nobserved in CaO. This proves that re-packing into bundles is size dependent. The strain \n\naccumulates on the calcite-CaO rod interfaces, but when the stress exceeds a critical value \n\nthe mechanical stability of the CaO aggregate is broken. The formation of macropores is \n\nthought to relieve the stresses. The CaO produced from small calcite particles does not \n\nreach this critical level of stress. 58 \n\nI.4.3 Reactivity in Air \n\nCalcium oxide produced from powders or single crystals in vacuum is very reactive \n\nand hydrates very fast compared to the ones produced in air. 66 This very high reactivity is \n\ndue to their higher surface areas because of high porosity and low crystallite size. There is \n\nalso evidence that this product (the formed hydrate) is nanocrystalline and forms \n\ninstantaneously when high reactive CaO is exposed to air. 51 \n\nThere are three possible reactions (I.24),(I.25) and (I.26), that can happen when \n\nCaO is exposed to air: \n\n ??? + ?2? ? ??(??)2 (I.24)  \n\n ??? + ??2 ? ????3 (I.25)  \n\n ??(??)2 + ??2 ? ????3 + ?2? (I.26)  \n\nWhich reaction happens will be decided not only by thermodynamics but also by \n\nkinetic factors. The calculated standard free energy for the reactions (?Go R) in equations \n\n(I.24), (I.25) and (I.26) are respectively -15.8 kcal mol-1, -31.2 kcal mol-1 and -15.4 kcal \n\nmol-1. 52 These values show that the reaction is spontaneous in all the cases (the more \n\nnegative the more spontaneous). The calculated standard enthalpy of the reactions (?Ho R) \n\nin equations (I.24), (I.25) and (I.26), are respectively -26.8 kcal mol-1, -42.6 kcal mol-1 and \n\n-15.9 kcal mol-1, showing that all the reactions are exothermic 52. \n\n                                                 \n* Accordingly to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the pore size is \n\ndefined in three categories: micropores have less than 2nm, mesopores have between 2 and 50nm and \nmacropores have more than 50nm. 62 \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter I \u2013 State of the Art  \n \n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\nHydration studies in CaO shows that this step leads to loss of specific surface area \n\nand increase in particle size, due to agglomeration 56 and to an increase of volume almost to \n\ndouble, creating internal strains in the material 67. The roughness is reported to increase \n\nwith the time of exposure to moisture 68. A study reports that just by quick transferring a \n\nhigh surface area CaO (78 m2/g) from the decomposition furnace to a thermogravimetry \n\napparatus, caused sample hydration to an extent of 15 to 18% 54. The hydration resistance \n\nof CaO sintered samples is reported to be enhanced with the sintering temperature. 69 \n\nWhile the hydration is reported to almost double the volume, the carbonation is \n\nreported to only increase the later by 12%. The number of crystallites formed by \n\ncarbonation is lower than by hydration. 70 The carbonation proceeds to the interior of the \n\nparticle by an advancing interface. The newly formed CaCO3, starts to inhibit the progress \n\nof the reaction because of its very low porosity which implies a large loss of surface area. \n71 This finding has been studied in order to improve the hydration resistance of CaO by \n\nforming a layer of the carbonated product. 72  \n\nWith the increasing interest for the greenhouse effect over the last years, there has \n\nbeen several studies defending the use of calcium oxide for high temperature CO2 \n\nsequestration and its performance after several cycles of decomposition and carbonation.  \n\nI.4.4 Sintering of Calcium Oxide \n\nSintering is a processing technique which is used to produce density controlled \n\nmaterials and components from ceramics or/and metal powders by applying thermal \n\nenergy. It is a process that is influenced by the powder and compact characteristics \n\n(impurities, morphology, particle size distribution, agglomeration, green density, etc.) and \n\nby the sintering conditions (heating and cooling rates, maximum temperature, holding \n\ntime, pressure, atmosphere, etc.). 33 The solid state sintering comprises three main phases: \n\n(i) the initial stage, which is characterized by rapid inter-particle neck growth and \n\ncorresponds to shrinking values up to 3%, (ii) the intermediate stage which goes until 90-\n\n95% of the theoretical density and is characterized by continuous pore phase at an \n\nequilibrium of their shape, and (iii) the final stage for densities higher than 95% and the \n\ngoal is to remove all porosity ending most of the times as isolated pores. 30 \n\nThe mechanisms of sintering in polycrystalline ceramics are the paths through \n\nwhich transport of matter happens. This happens from regions which have higher chemical \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n36 \n\n \n\npotentials towards regions with lower chemical potentials. 30 At least 6 mechanisms of \n\nsintering exist in solid state sintering and they are illustrated in the Figure I-9. \n\n \nFigure I-9 - Mechanisms of solid state sintering. Only 4 to 6 cause densification, but all cause neck growth \ninfluencing densification. 30 \n\nThe specific surface area is a much sensitive parameter in the evaluation of \n\nsintering and can be used for studying the kinetics of the initial sintering. The following \n\nequation was proposed in a model developed by R. German and A. Munir 73 for the surface \n\narea reduction in the initial stage sintering, under isothermal conditions: \n\n ?\n??\n?0\n?\n?\n\n= ?? (I.27)  \n\nwhere S is the surface area, S0 is the initial surface area, ? is an exponent related to the \n\nsintering mechanism, t is the time and k can be expressed as: \n\n ? =\n?0?\n\n? ???\n\n???\n (I.28)  \n\nbeing k0 a constant term of a given material, Q the activation energy, R the gas constant, T \n\nthe temperature, r the particle radius, and m the Herring scaling exponent. This kinetic \n\nmodel is also called the German and Munir model. It is only valid for ?S/S0<0.5, until \n\nnecks start to touch each other, marking the end of the initial stage sintering.  There are \n\nalso other assumptions like dense and spherical monosized particles. \n\nShrinkage is another kinetic parameter for the first stage of sintering and the \n\nfollowing equation was derived, under isothermal conditions 33: \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter I \u2013 State of the Art  \n \n\n \n\n37 \n\n \n\n ?\n??\n?0\n?\n?\n\n= ??? (I.29)  \n\nwhere l is the length of the pellet, l0 is the initial length, s is an exponent related to the \n\nsintering mechanism, t is the time and ks a constant containing material and matter \n\ntransport terms. \n\nThe theoretical values of ? are shown in the Table I-4, for different particle \n\ncoordination numbers, related with the particle packing, and for different sintering \n\nmechanisms. Theoretical values of the exponent s can also be seen in the same table.  \nTable I-4 \u2013 Kinetic exponents for surface area and shrinkage in initial stage models. 33,73 \n\nMechanism Densification \n\n? \n\ns \n(Nc fractional density) \n\n4 \n(0.32) \n\n7 \n(0.60) \n\n10 \n(0.68) \n\nViscous or plastic flow Yes 1.1 1.1 1.1 1 \nEvaporation-condensation No 1.6 1.5 1.4 - \nVolume diffusion Yes 2.7 2.7 2.7 2 \nGrain-boundary diffusion Yes 3.3 3.3 3.2 3 \nSurface diffusion No 3.6 3.5 3.4 - \n\n \n\nThe sintering of calcium oxide powders having high specific surface areas was \n\ninvestigated taking as variables the oxide precursors 74,75,69, either the carbonate or the \n\nhydroxide and the sintering atmospheres: air 75,69, N2 74, H2O and CO2 76 . \nW. De Keyser et al. 75 studied CaO sintering in air atmosphere, reporting much \n\nhigher sintering speeds of CaO produced from Ca(OH)2, CH, than from CaCO3, CC, both \n\ncalcined at 1000oC (CH precursor was 0.45 \u00b5m and CC was 2.7 \u00b5m particle size powders). \n\nMain shrinkage is observed in both cases after 1100\u00baC, and for the CaO produced from \n\nCa(OH)2 shrinkage is much higher than the one produced from CaCO3 case. It is \n\nsuggested that the production of CaO from the hydroxide introduces in the CaO lattice a \n\nlarge number of excess vacancies. These vacancies enhance the mater transport during the \n\nsintering process. \n\nR. Borgwardt 74 investigated the sintering of high surface area CaO powders \n\nproduced from CaCO3 (S=104 m2/g) and Ca(OH)2 (S=76.7 m2/g) in a flowing N2 \n\natmosphere. The reduction SSA was followed between 700oC and 1100oC and the kinetic \n\nanalysis, using the German and Munir model 73, was applied. The calculated average ? \n\nexponent value of 2.7, agreeing with lattice diffusion as sintering controlling mechanism. \n\nThe CH, also showed in this study, a much faster sintering rate than CC which was \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n38 \n\n \n\nattributed to its lower porosity, leading to a denser compact with more contact points \n\nbetween the particles. Finally, by decomposing CaCO3 pure and with impurities he \n\nobserved a higher sintering rate for the latter, which was explained by the effect of \n\nimpurities creating lattice defects and therefore, accelerating solid-state diffusion \n\nprocesses. \n\nR. Borgwardt 76 also studied the influence of presence of H2O and CO2 in the \n\nsintering atmosphere of the same CaO powders used in the previous study 74, from 350oC \n\nto 1150oC, and partials pressures up to 1.5x103 Pa of H2O and up to 1.2x103 Pa of CO2. \n\nBoth types of gas are reported to strongly catalyze the sintering process and, furthermore, \n\ntheir effects are additive. The kinetic analysis taking the German and Munir model 73 \n\ncouldn\u2019t identify the mechanism, since the values of ? exponent increased by increasing \n\nH2O or CO2 pressure and the values are higher than the theoretical ones, in Table I-4. \n\nOther mechanisms, than lattice diffusion may be operating and it was proposed that the \n\npresence of CO2 and H2O on free surfaces and interfaces activates the surface and grain \n\nboundary transport.  \n\nD. Beruto et al. 65 studied the influence of the CO2 pressure in the sintering of CaO \n\nwith ~120 m2/g. He observed that a CO2 pressure around 1330 Pa greatly increases the \n\nsintering of CaO at a low temperature of 686oC which is in accord with the activating \n\neffect of CO2 in the matter transport for sintering also reported by R. Borgwart 76. The \n\nsurface area reached more than 50% of reduction after 10h, at this temperature. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n \n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\nChapter II  - Experimental Procedure \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter II \u2013 Experimental Procedure  \n \n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\nII.1 Characterization Techniques \n\nThe different techniques and experiments used for material characterization, both in \n\nUniversity of Aveiro and CERN will be shortly described in this section.  \n\nII.1.1 X-Ray Diffraction - XRD \n\nX-Ray diffraction was a very useful technique in this work, enabling a qualitative \n\nanalysis of the crystalline phases in the powder and pre-sintered samples. The \n\ndetermination of the crystallite size was done using this technique. \n\nBy exposing a crystalline sample to a X-ray beam, some of those X-rays are \n\ndiffracted according to a certain angle (2?) matching characteristic crystallographic \n\ndirections of the material as given by the Bragg\u2019s Law 31. This diffracted X-rays are \n\ndetected, generally, by a moving counter in a goniometer, giving origin to more counts at \n\nthe certain angles, producing peaks in a plot of counts per second versus the diffraction \n\nangle (2?). \n\nAt the University of Aveiro, the equipment used was a Rigaku\u00ae D/Max-B with an \n\nX-ray source (?CuK?=1.54056\u00c5), in which a potential of 40kV and a current of 30mA is \n\napplied. Another similar equipment, at CERN, Siemens D-5000 Diffractometer, was used. \n\nThe tests were done by grinding, when needed, the samples to powder in an agate mortar. \n\nThe sweeping angles used were from 10o2? to 80o2? and a step of 0.02 o2?, with a speed of \n\n3o2?/s was used. This equipment is connected to a computer which records the results and \n\nhelps in the phase identification through the X-ray diffraction peaks. For this, in the case of \n\nthe Rigaku\u00ae D/Max-B, a software named Jade (version 9.3.4 \u2013 05-02-2011) was used \n\nwhich has an integrated database of Powder Diffraction Files (PDF) from the International \n\nCenter of Data Diffraction (ICDD). For the Siemens D-5000 Diffractometer a software \n\nnamed TOPAS P v2.0 was used.  \n\nThrough the broadening of the X-ray diffraction peaks, crystallite sizes of less than \n\n~0.1\u00b5m can be conveniently measured. 30 The crystallite size is given by the Scherer \n\nequation: 77 \n\n ? =\n??\n\n? cos ?\n (II.1)  \n\nwhere ? is the breadth usually expressed as the full width at half maximum (FWHM), ? is \n\nthe diffraction angle, ? is the wavelength of the X-rays, G is the crystal size and K is a \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\nconstant to account for particle shapes (close to unity, usually 0.9). The broadening is also \n\naffected by instrumental factors. Such factors have to be subtracted to correctly calculate \n\nthe crystallite size. To measure the instrumental broadening a macrocrystalline material in \n\nwhich the broadening is negligible can be used. 77 In this case, the instrumental broadening \n\nwas determined with a macrocrystalline lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6). \n\nTo measure the FWHM a mathematical treatment has to be done to the \n\ndiffractograms peaks. There are 4 empirical peak shape functions: Gauss, Lorentz, Pseudo-\n\nVoigt which is a convolution from the last two and Pearson-VII. The latter two are the \n\nmost used, 78 and accordingly the mathematical treatment was done using the software \n\nJade or TOPAS with the Pearson-VII to do the fitting. The peaks were considered to be \n\nsymmetric and to subtract the background a 4th order polynomial function was chosen.  \n\nII.1.2 Surface Area and Porosity Measurements through Isotherm \nDetermination \u2013 BET/BJH \n\nAdsorption measurement based on the Brunauner, Emmet and Teller (BET) \n\nisotherm is a method commonly used to determine the specific surface area (SSA) of a \n\npowder or porous material. 79  \n\nThis measurement is done at 77K in which N2 adsorption, the most common gas \n\nused in BET, is easier to measure.  By putting a solid of a known mass in contact with a \n\nknown volume of gas, it adsorbs creating a decrease in the pressure, from which the \n\namount of adsorbed gas can be calculated. From this measurements a plot of the amount of \n\ngas adsorbed versus the relative pressure (p/p0, p0 being the saturation vapor pressure of \n\nthe adsorption gas used) is represented, which is called the adsorption isotherm. The BET \n\nequation that can be applied to the isotherm curve, which is only valid for lower values of \n\np/p0 (usually between 0.05 and 0.3) and is used in this form: 79 \n\n \n?\n\n?(?0 ? ?)\n=\n\n1\n???\n\n+\n? ? 1\n???\n\n?\n?0\n\n (II.2)  \n\nwhere V is the volume of gas adsorbed, Vm is the monolayer volume and C is a constant.  \n\nBy this procedure the Vm can be calculated (from the slope and the intercept) and applied \n\nin equation (II.3) to calculate the surface area: 79 \n\n ? =\n?????\n?0\n\n (II.3)  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter II \u2013 Experimental Procedure  \n \n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\nwhere the S is the surface area, NA is the Avogadro number, ? is the area of an adsorbed \n\ngas molecule and V0 is the volume of 1mol of gas at STP (Standard Temperature and \n\nPressure). \n\nThe average particle size (GBET) of a powder can also be known, assuming a certain \n\nparticle shape, and dense and unagglomerated particles, by the following equation: 80 \n\n ???? =\n?\n\n? \u00d7 ??\n (II.4)  \n\nwhere ds is the theoretical density of the solid material and f is a particle shape factor \n\ndefined in Table II-1. \nTable II-1 \u2013 Shape factors and respective packing fractions for different powder geometries. 80 \n\nPowder Shape Shape factor, f Packing fraction \nSphere 6.0 0.60 \nEllipsoid (1:2:4) 7.6 0.52 \nCylinder (1:1) 6.0 0.61 \nCylinder (1:2) 5.0 0.60 \nCylinder (1:10) 4.2 0.48 \nCube 7.4 0.72 \nParallelepiped (1:4:4) 9.4 0.68 \nFlake (1:10) 24 0.55 \n\n \n\nThe very initial part of an isotherm and its end may also give information about the \n\nmaterial porosity. There are 6 different main types of the isotherms accordingly to \n\nBrunauer, Emmet and Teller. 30 The different isotherms represent different properties of a \n\nmaterial, also the different type of hysteresis on adsorption and desorption measurements \n\nreveals much about the type of porosity. From the isotherms the pore size distribution \n\n(PSD), pore volume and pore area can be obtained, using either the nonlinear high p/p0 \n\nzone of the isothermal or the low one, through methods such as the t-plot (for \n\nmicroporosity area) and the Barret-Joyner-Halenda method (BJH) for the PSD, pore \n\nvolume and pore area. For further reading refer to the bibliography. 81,79 \n\nThe equipment used was a Micromeritics\u00ae \u2013 Gemini 2370 V5, in the University of \n\nAveiro, and a Quantachrome\u00ae eNOVA2200, at CERN, which both use N2 as the \n\nadsorption gas and liquid N2 to cool down the samples. \n\nBefore every test the samples were degased at 200oC for 4-6h in flowing nitrogen.  \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\nII.1.3 Differential Thermal and Thermogravimetric Analysis \u2013 DTA/TGA \n\nDifferential Thermal Analysis (DTA) is a technique that permits to know the \n\nthermal behavior of a material and the transformations it goes through.  \n\nThis is done by heating up the material, registering the temperature difference \n\nagainst an inert material (reference, normally pure alumina), which is being heated \n\nsimultaneously. The temperature difference (in ?V) is then plotted against the temperature \n\nof the furnace and positive differences between them indicating exothermal \n\ntransformations or negative ones, endothermic transformations. \n\nIt\u2019s usual in this kind of tests to record the weight variation during DTA test, which  \n\ntechnique is called thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). This provides additional \n\ninformation about the transformation that is occurring, by overlapping the weight loss \n\ncurve (TGA) with temperature to the thermal energy curve (DTA). \n\nThe equipment used was a Shimadzu\u00ae TGA-50. It\u2019s a DTA/TGA equipment with \n\nthe capability of doing the tests under a flowing gas of choice. The tests were done under \n\nflowing Argon. All tests were done in the same conditions: heating from room temperature \n\nto 1000oC at a rate of 10oC/min. \n\nII.1.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy \u2013 SEM/STEM \n\nThe scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is a widely used technique to study the \n\nmicrostructure and morphology of materials. An electron gun generates a beam of \n\nelectrons inside a vacuum column which is then focused and driven to collide with a target, \n\nthe sample. An image is possible due to the electronic signal generated by the low angle \n\nbackscattered electrons, which are created by electron interactions with the material \n\nsurface. 31 \n\nThe SEM equipment used was a Hitachi\u00ae model SU-70, in the University of \n\nAveiro, that has a maximum electron acceleration potential of 30 kV, a point-to-point \n\nresolution of 1 nm at 15 kV and an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). This \n\nequipment also permits transmission electron microscopy by putting a detector below the \n\nsample. This technique is often called scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). \n\nThe powder samples were prepared by making a diluted suspension of powder in \n\npure ethanol (99%) followed by deposition of a drop in a copper micrometric grid. The \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter II \u2013 Experimental Procedure  \n \n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\nsupport was then put inside the microscope before the drop dried to minimize the powder \n\ncontact with air. Both SEM and STEM observations were done. \n\nTo observe the thermal treated pellets, they were fractured and put on carbon tape \n\nand then coated with gold to make them conductive and prevent hydration. 62,63 \n\nAt CERN, SEM was done in a Link Leo Oxford Instruments\u00ae, model LEO 430I. \n\nThis microscope has a maximum resolution of 4 nm and an electron potential acceleration \n\nup to 40 kV. It is also equipped with EDS. The same sample preparation techniques were \n\nused but instead of a cooper grid, carbon tape was used. \n\nII.1.5 Transmission Electron Microscopy - TEM \n\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) has the same operation principle of SEM \n\n(see section II.1.4), but in this case the electrons are accelerated at a much higher potential \n\nto pass through the sample towards the detector below it. The electrons, passing through \n\nthe sample, which has to be very thin to allow it, are either absorbed or dispersed changing \n\ntheir directions. This dispersion is influenced by the atomic arrangement of the material. \n\nAfterwards they are focused again, amplified and projected in a fluorescent screen or in a \n\nmonitor. 31 \n\nTEM was done in a Hitachi\u00ae model 9000, in the University of Aveiro, with an \n\nacceleration potential of 300 kV. The samples for TEM were prepared by depositing a drop \n\nof a diluted powder suspension in pure ethanol (99%) in a micrometric copper grid. After \n\ndrop dried, the grid was inserted in the support of the TEM sample chamber. \n\nII.1.6 Tape Station \u2013 Release Curves Measurement at ISOLDE \n\nIn order to measure the yield and the release curve of a specific isotope, a device \n\ncalled tape station is used. This device transports implanted isotopes from the beam \n\ntowards ?(?) and ? detectors. They are made of a plastic scintillator in the case of detector \n\nfor ? particles and a Germanium crystal for ? detection. \n\nA release curve and yield are characteristic of a defined isotope and target unit. In \n\norder to accurately measure those, the beam has to have a high isotope to background noise \n\nratio. The background is referred as being other isotopes produced and/or radiation \n\nresulting from the experimental hall or natural radiation. By increasing the isotope to \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\nbackground ratio, the background can be minimized until a point where the decay detected \n\ncan be assumed to be all resulted from the isotope being produced. \n\nThe tape station has two detectors and a metallic mylar tape that moves the atoms \n\ncollected for a certain time (tcollection) to a measurement zone where the decay is measured \n\nfor defined time (tmeasurement). By separating the measurement zone from the detection zone \n\nan adaptable system is obtained. Either high beam intensities which would saturate the \n\ndetectors can be measured by reducing the tmeasurement or the tcollection, or low beam \n\nintensities in which to get some statistics those times have to be increased. In Figure II-1 \n\na), the different elements of a tape station can be seen. \n\nThe obtained values have to be corrected for the losses of isotopes during all this \n\nprocesses, if they have short half-lives, in such a way that this corresponds to the release \n\ncurve of the isotope right after its production. For this tcollection, tmeasurement, tdelay and the \n\ntime that the tape takes to transport the atoms from the detection zone to the measurement \n\nzone (ttransport) have to be recorded. This curve is then fitted and corrected by a dedicated \n\nprogram to get the time constants from equation (I.2) from the pulse shape and then finally, \n\nthe yield. The process of the obtainment of the beam and its way to the tape station can be \n\nseen in Figure II-1 b) and the steps for the measurement of a release curve are schematized \n\nin Figure II-1 c). \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure II-1 \u2013 Picture of the fast tape station at ISOLDE (a), scheme of the RIB production until it arrives at the \ntape station 26 (b) and schematic representation of the tape station operation to build the release curve 26 (c). \n\nDetector \n\na) \nb) \n\nc) \n\nTape Storage \nTurbo pump \n\nTape \nmovement \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter II \u2013 Experimental Procedure  \n \n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\nFor isotopes which don\u2019t have characteristic gamma decay another type of test can \n\nbe done using ? decay properties. After collection, the tape is transported to the detector \n\nand the decay is measured over time, building a decay curve. This permits the \n\nidentification of an isotope through its characteristic half-life.  \n\nThere are two tape stations at ISOLDE which ares located at different beam lines \n\nafter the mass separator. The main difference between them is the minimum possible time \n\nthat the tape takes to move from the detection zone to the measurement zone. Because of \n\nthat, one is called the fast tape station (ttransport,min=200 ms) and the other the old tape \n\nstation(ttransport,min=900 ms). \n\nTo evaluate if there are contaminations in the beam after separation, gamma \n\nspectroscopy can be done, in which the different isotopes are assessed by their gamma \n\ndecays. The peaks obtained are then compared (energy and relative intensity) with \n\nreferences in databases 14,82 to identify the isotopes. \n\nII.2 Raw Material \n\nFor the material characterization studies done at the University of Aveiro, the raw \n\nmaterial used to produce the calcium oxide (CaO) was a&lt;5\u00b5m calcium carbonate (CaCO3) \n\npowder, with 99.5% chemical purity (metal basis) that was acquired from Alfa Aesar\u00ae. \n\nCharacteristics of the material were retrieved from the supplier and additional \n\ncharacterization was also done, such as SEM, Coulter, XRD and DTA/TGA analysis \n\n(whose technique details are described ahead (Section II.1)), which results are presented in \n\nFigure II-2 to 3 and resumed in Table II-2. \n\n \nFigure II-2 - XRD of the raw material, CaCO 3 , used to produce CaO. \n\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n\nIn\nte\n\nns\nit\n\ny \n(C\n\nou\nnt\n\ns \npe\n\nr \nse\n\nco\nnd\n\n) \n\n2?

A vacuum system was coupled to the furnace, which consisted in \n\na vacuum pump Adixen\u00ae Pascal 2010 SD with a nominal pumping speed of 8.3m3/h, a \n\npirani gauge Adixen\u00ae AP 2004 to measure the pressure (p) and a pressure display Adixen\u00ae \n\nACS 2000 connected to a computer to register the pressure during the thermal cycle with \n\nthe software AVG View provided by Adixen\u00ae. The vertical tube had steel flanges cooled by \n\na circuit of water to avoid the deterioration of the rubber o-rings. In the connection of the \n\npump to the tube there was a valve to control the pumping speed at the beginning of the \n\ncycle. A needle valve was installed in the furnace to break the vacuum slowly, when the \n\ncalcination was finished. The sample holder made of alumina foam and mulite served as \n\nsupport to a cylindrical crucible with a lid for keeping the powder inside during the initial \n\nstage of the pumping of the furnace.  \n\nBefore calcination of the powder, tests of the furnace hot zone, heating and cooling \n\nrates, holding temperature and cycle duration were done. To accurately measure the \n\ntemperature, a type-R thermocouple (Platinum/Platinum-13%Rhodium) was placed in the \n\nbase of the sample holder and connected to a two channel Zipp &amp; Zonen\u00ae recorder. As the \n\nfurnace doesn\u2019t have forced cooling, at the cooling rates used (10oC/min) it enters a natural \n\ncooling rate from 700\u00baC to room temperature (RT) taking about 7h. \n\nA test to the vacuum conditions was done too to optimize the vacuum system and \n\ndetect eventual leaks. In the end of the tests, the minimum vacuum pressure achieved by \n\nthe system after 6h of pumping was in the order of 10-1 to 1 Pa at room temperature and \n\n10Pa at 1100\u00baC.  \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\nIn the following table (Table II-3) are summarized the calcination conditions.

The powder specific surface \n\narea, XRD phase identification and crystallite size (before and after exposure) as well as \n\nDTA/TGA of the reacted powders, were performed. \n\nTo evaluate the reversibility of the air reaction, the exposed powders were thermal \n\ntreated in vacuum at 800\u00baC for different times (5, 15 and 40 min) and the SSA and \n\ncrystallite size were determined. Also DTA/TGA was done to the \u201crecovered\u201d ones to \n\nevaluate if the conversion to CaO was complete. \n\nII.4.1 Sample Storage \n\nDue to the observed high reactivity of the produced CaO powders to moisture and \n\nCO2, the samples were kept under special conditions, reducing the pressure of these gases \n\nin the surrounding atmosphere. This was achieved by using a 2l Nahita\u00ae glass desiccator \n\nwith a valve which could be connected to a pump to evacuate the system, storing the \n\nsamples under vacuum.  \n\nThe need to open the desiccator during the studies exposed the samples to air and \n\nso, a desiccant, silica gel, was used to reduce the hydration. Afterwards, the nanometric \n\nCaO powder itself (produced in house by decomposition of CaCO3 in vacuum at 700\u00baC), \n\nwas used as a desiccant. 61 This powder proved to be much more effective, greatly \n\nreducing the weight gain of the samples, as can be seen in Table II-4.  \nTable II-4 - Weight gain of one CaO sample with different desiccants. \n\nDesiccant \nWeight gain (%) \n\nSilica Gel CaO \n1st day 0.24 0.01 \n2nd day 0.55 0.02 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n52 \n\n \n\nII.5 Microstructural Evolution During Vacuum Sintering \n\nThe obtained CaO powder was compacted and thermal treated in a furnace at the \n\nUniversity of Aveiro, under a temperature range and vacuum pressure equivalent to those \n\nused during CaO target operation at ISOLDE, CERN.   \n\nIn order to study the microstructural evolution during sintering, cylindrical \n\ncompacts, 10 mm diameter, 2-3 mm in thickness were pressed by using a hydraulic \n\nCarver\u00ae Laboratory Press \u2013 Model C. A small study of the press conditions was done just \n\nin order to evaluate the pressure required to give the compact some mechanical integrity \n\nfor normal handling and having at the same time a high porosity. It was concluded that the \n\nbest settings were pressing ~0.25 g of powder at 125 MPa for 5 s, resulting in a compact \n\nwith high porosity, P~60%. \n\nSince the target units are operated at pressures of ~10-4 Pa, a furnace which could \n\nachieve approximate vacuum conditions was used. A Thermolab\u00ae FTV 213/2007 furnace \n\nwas used, which could reach pressures of 10-4 Pa at RT and from 10-3 to 10-2 Pa 1200\u00baC. \n\nThis furnace is composed of a small chamber, with a tungsten heating element, which was \n\npumped by a rotary and an oil diffusion pump. Both chamber and diffusion pump were \n\ncooled by a water circuit. \n\nThe handling of powder and compacts revealed to be a very challenging process, \n\nsince hydration and carbonation occurs very fast, affecting the powder characteristics and \n\ncausing break of compacts. Therefore, immediately after pressing, the compacts were \n\nmaintained under vacuum. Nevertheless, some samples were found broken after the \n\nthermal cycle. \n\nA summary of the sintering conditions can be found in the Table II-5. After \n\nsintering, the specific surface area (SSA) the shrinkage (whenever possible) and crystallite \n\nsize were determined.  \nTable II-5 - Experimental conditions in CaO sintering experiments. \n\nSample CaO compacts (P?60%) \nSintering Temperatures 900 \u2013 1200\u00baC \nHeating Speed 10\u00baC/min \nCooling Speed 15\u00baC/min  \nDwell Time 3min \u2013 10h \nPressure 10-4 - 10-2 Pa \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter II \u2013 Experimental Procedure  \n \n\n \n\n53 \n\n \n\nThe obtained SSA reductions and shrinkage were then plotted vs. holding time and \n\nfitted accordingly to the model presented in equation (I.27), using the program Origin \n\nv8.5.1. Identically, the same data treatment procedure was done to the shrinkage. \n\nII.6 Material Testing at ISOLDE-CERN \n\nAfter the synthesis of CaO from calcium carbonate, the respective powder \n\ncharacterization and sintering kinetic studies at the University of Aveiro, this investigation \n\nproceeded at ISOLDE. Before online operation, studies were performed on the CaO \n\nsynthesis at ISOLDE to evaluate the powder microstructure. This was done using the \n\nestablished conditions for CaO target production, named \u201cold procedure\u201d, and to compare \n\nthe microstructure of the calcinated powder obtained at ISOLDE using an equivalent \n\nthermal cycle as used in Aveiro, calling it \u201cnew procedure\u201d. \n\nIn consequence of the investigation done, new conditions for the target preparation \n\nand handling could be implemented. \n\nII.6.1 CaO Target Production at ISOLDE: \u201cOld Procedure\u201d \n\nIn order to produce and characterize the CaO used in the past at ISOLDE, the \u201cold \n\nprocedure\u201d was done. The raw material (CaCO3) was first dried by heating it in a porcelain \n\ncrucible at 200\u00baC for a day. A rhenium (Re) boat with approximately the dimensions of the \n\ntarget (195 mm long and 20 mm diameter) was filled with the powder and put in a \n\ndedicated oven (see Figure II-6), similar to a target unit, in high vacuum (10-3<p<10-2 Pa) \n\nusing a turbo and a rotary pumps. The temperature was then increased (measured with an \n\noptical pyrometer), until pressure reached 10-2 Pa, up to 1200oC. The process took about \n\n24h and was over when the pressure reached a value lower than 10-3 Pa, indicating that the \n\ndecarbonation reaction is finished. To make sure that the decarbonation was complete the \n\noven was kept at the final temperature for some hours, after reaching 10-3 Pa. Afterwards, \n\nthe oven was cooled down and purged with Ar and the Re boat was refilled - due to the \n\nhigh loss of mass (~44%) - with CaCO3, maintaining the CaO produced so far. The whole \n\nprocess was then repeated one more time.  \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n54 \n\n \n\n \nFigure II-6 \u2013 Pumpstand used to produce the CaO at ISOLDE. In the picture: the oven (a), the turbo pump (b), \nand below a rotary pump (c), the controls for the water cooling and others (d), the bottle of Ar to purge the system \n(e) and the window used to measure the temperature with the pyrometer (f). \n\nAt the end of the process (which takes around 48h) the oven was purged again with \n\nAr and the Re boat was taken out of the oven and kept in a desiccator for material \n\ncharacterization testing. During the whole process the Re boat was weighted whenever \n\npossible to assess the reaction completion. Since the oven is known to have a thermal \n\ngradient from the sides to the center of it, samples were taken separately in both \n\ntemperature zones for characterization by SEM, XRD and BET. \n\nThese synthesis conditions were applied to another carbonate powder (see its \n\ncharacteristics in Appendix (Table A-1)) previously used at ISOLDE in the preparation of \n\nthe CaO targets. This sample was designated T12 and was characterized through BET, \n\nXRD and SEM. The calcination conditions are summarized in Table II-6. \nTable II-6 - Calcination conditions for the \"old process\" of the CaO target production at ISOLDE.  \n\nCalcination Temperature up to 1200oC \nHeating and Cooling Speed Not defined \nHolding Time Not defined (whole cycle takes ~48h) \nPressure 10-3 to 10-2 Pa \n\n \n\nII.6.2 CaO Target Production at ISOLDE: \u201cNew Procedure\u201d \n\nBased on the obtained results for CaO synthesis, handling and sintering in this \n\nresearch, adjustments for the production method were proposed and applied. Further \n\nchanges in the target unit were also done. \n\na) \n\nb) \n\nc) \n\nd) \n\ne) f) \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter II \u2013 Experimental Procedure  \n \n\n \n\n55 \n\n \n\nTo produce the new target, the raw material used at the UA studies was used. The \n\nprocess was very similar to the old one, but the following changes were made: (i) the \n\nheating and cooling rates were fixed at 10oC/min; (ii) the temperature was risen in one step \n\nto 800oC (overriding the pressure interlock at 10-2 Pa) and the pressures rose up to a \n\nmaximum of 160 Pa, similarly to the synthesis studies at the University of Aveiro (see \n\nFigure II-5); (iii) instead of a pyrometer to measure the temperature, a thermocouple type \n\nK was installed for a more accurate control; (iv) the material was kept at 800oC, for 48h, in \n\norder to insure a complete reaction and to outgas the impurities; (v) no refill was done to \n\navoid unnecessary material hydration (vi) and the transfer of the material to the target unit \n\nwas done in a gloves box in a controlled Argon atmosphere (as seen in Figure II-7). \n\nAfterwards, as usual for every target at ISOLDE, the target and the ion source temperatures \n\nwere calibrated against input voltage and current, and the target was mounted on the \n\noffline separator for further tests and outgasing of impurities. The newly produced CaO \n\nwas likewise characterized by BET and XRD. Two powder samples, named S80, were \n\ntaken, one from the center and another from the side of the target. The calcination \n\nconditions can be seen in Table II-7. \nTable II-7 - Calcination conditions for the \"new process\" of the CaO target production at ISOLDE.  \n\nCalcination Temperature 800oC \nHeating and Cooling Speed 10oC/min \nHolding Time ~48h \nPressure 10-3 to 160 Pa \n\n \n\nThe new target unit has also undergone some evolution: two type C thermocouples \n\nwere installed in order to measure the current temperature at the center of the container and \n\nat the sides, during online operation. A different heat shielding was installed in order to \n\nreduce the temperature gradient along the container. A different ion source with improved \n\nionization efficiency of argon was used. \n\nTo assess the reproducibility of the process at ISOLDE and characterize the new \n\ntarget material, a calcium oxide sample was produced in the same target oven with the \n\nsame thermal cycle used at the UA (2h of holding time at 800oC, with 10oC/min of heating \n\nand cooling rates). The resulting sample was named T80 and characterized in terms of \n\nsurface area and porosity.  \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n56 \n\n \n\n \nFigure II-7 \u2013 Gloves box used to do the material change to the target unit.

The target unit was then heated up to operation temperatures (up to 800oC), \n\nwhich in the case of the old CaO targets was around 1100oC to 1200oC. Stable beams were \n\nassessed for different masses to evaluate the level of impurities produced by the target \n\nmaterial and ion source. The ion source efficiency was then tested by injecting known \n\nquantities of noble gases through a calibrated leak, and monitoring the mass separated in \n\nthe beam. The target was left for 3 days at the operation temperatures to outgas impurities. \n\nBefore the transport to the ISOLDE frontend, the target unit was filled with argon and \n\nsealed. \n\nII.7.2 Online Operation \n\nThe new target was mounted in the front end of ISOLDE, pumped and operated at \n\ntemperatures up to 800oC with low proton intensities, 8x1012 protons per pulse (usually its \n\n3x1013). The new target was labeled with the reference CaO#469. \n\nSince there was a thermal gradient on the container of the target CaO#469, a \n\nweighted average, to determine a representative (rounded) temperature given by the \n\nthermocouples (T), was taken into account according to the following formula: \n\na) \n\nb) \n\nc) \n\nd) \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter II \u2013 Experimental Procedure  \n \n\n \n\n57 \n\n \n\n ? =\n2?? + ??\n\n3\n (II.5)  \n\nwhere TS is the temperature at the sides of the container, TC is temperature at center of the \n\ncontainer, as schematically represented in Figure II-8.

For the tests on the very short lived isotopes such as 31,32Ar the tape \n\nstation is not able to measure. For this a special experimental setup (IS476 2) was used. In \n\norder to compare and scale the values 33Ar was measured in both systems.

To attain \n\nthis goal, the microstructure of the target material had to be investigated aiming at \n\ncontrolling it. This section presents the results of the CaO synthesis from the respective \n\ncarbonate, powder characterization, and powder microstructure evolution during thermal \n\ntreatments. \n\nIII.1.1 Synthesis of CaO \n\nIn order to study the influence of the thermal cycle in the decomposition reaction of \n\nCaCO3, different conditions were tested. The summary of the decomposition conditions \n\nand characteristics of the obtained CaO powder can be seen on Table III-1. A holding time \n\nof 2h was used for the majority of experiments, which was increased for lower \n\ntemperatures in order to achieve total decomposition. A long duration cycle of 48h, at \n\n1000oC, was also tested in D10 sample. The main parameters to characterize the obtained \n\npowder were the crystallite size, by XRD using the most intense peak (200), and the \n\nspecific surface area. From the surface area, applying equation (II.3), the particle size \n\ncould be estimated. \nTable III-1 \u2013 Summary of the decomposition conditions and characteristics of the obtained powders. \n\nSample \nT \n\n(oC) \nt \n\n(h) \nWL \n(%) \n\np \n(Pa) \n\nSSA \n(m2/g) \n\nGBET \n(nm) \n\nXS \n(nm) \n\nMain XRD \nPhases \n\nDetected \n\nAverage \nPore Size \n\n(nm) \n\nP \n(%) \n\nD55 550 16 36 ~1 19 - 35 CaO, CaCO3 - - \nD60 600 12 44 ~1 53 34 37 CaO - - \nD65 650 3 44 ~1 38 - 38 CaO, Ca(OH)2 - - \nD70 700 2 45 ~1 49 37 35 CaO - - \nD80 800 2 46 ~1 46 39 38 CaO - - \nD90 900 2 46 ~1 42 42 36 CaO - - \nD10 1000 48 45 ~1 35 51 50 CaO 11 32 \nN80 800 2 - ~10-1 58\u00b14 31\u00b13 32\u00b12 CaO 12 44 \n\n \n\nFor a total CaCO3 decomposition, 44% of weight loss (WL) is expected taking the \n\nstoichiometry expressed by equation (I.22), but in some cases, higher values of WL were \n\nobserved due to losses of powder from the crucible during the furnace operation. The \n\nsample D55, calcined at 550oC, had a lower value of WL (36%) suggesting incomplete \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n62 \n\n \n\ndecomposition (confirmed by XRD) which matches the low value of SSA, due to the \n\npresence of low SSA CaCO3 (2.80 m2/g). In the case of D65, the decomposition was \n\ncomplete but significant hydration had occurred, as confirmed by the detection of Ca(OH)2 \n\nby XRD, leading to a lower SSA value. The effects of powder hydration on the SSA will \n\nbe further detailed ahead. In all other samples no CaCO3 phase or traces could be detected \n\non the XRD, confirming the full decomposition, but often traces of the Ca(OH)2 could be \n\ndetected. These results are similar to those obtained by D. Glasson at the same \n\ntemperature, as can be seen in Table I-3, page 32. \n\n After the optimization of the furnace operation, to operate under lower vacuum \n\n(p~10-1Pa), the samples produced at 800oC (N80) yielded an average SSA value of 58\u00b14 \n\nm2/g with XS being 32\u00b12 nm in agreement with GBET (31\u00b13 nm).  \n\nIn order to better visualize the effect of the decomposition temperature on the \n\nsurface area and crystallite size, for similar vacuum conditions, the plot of the Figure III-1 \n\nwas done. \n\n \nFigure III-1 - Plot of the specific surface area (SSA) and the crystallite size (XS) versus temperature for the \ncalcined powder, obtained under similar vacuum conditions, and 2h of holding time. \n\nIn Figure III-1 a linear decrease of the SSA with the increase of the decomposition \n\ntemperature can be seen. The behavior is in agreement with the results of E. Powell 61.  D. \n\nGlasson\u2019s 56 results showed increasing surface area until 800oC and then fast decreasing of \n\nSSA, claimed to be due to sintering of CaO, he stated. This behavior doesn\u2019t match the \n\nobtained results in this work. No tendency was found for the variation of the determined \n\ncrystallite size. The XS values present a fairly good agreement with the obtained GBET, \n\nvalue and confirm that a nanometric material is obtained by decomposing CaCO3 under \n\nvacuum, in this range of temperatures, as confirmed by other authors 50,51,54,55,57. \n\n30\n\n34\n\n38\n\n42\n\n46\n\n50\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n500 600 700 800 900 1000\n\nXS\n (n\n\nm\n) \n\nSS\nA\n\n (m\n2 /\n\ng)\n \n\nTemperature (oC) \n\nSSA\n\nXS\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \nChapter III \u2013 Results and Discussion  \n\n63 \n\n \n\nDespite the fact that the obtained powders were nanometric, the obtained surface \n\nareas are somehow lower than those obtained in the literature (see Table I-3, in page 32). \n\nThis differences may come from the better vacuum conditions reported in the literature \n\n(10-2<p<10-5 Pa), lower temperatures used for decomposition and better storage/transport \n\nconditions up to the material analysis equipment. Furthermore, J. Ewing 63 and D. Beruto 58 \n\nreported that in powder beds, residual pressures of CO2 decreases the surface areas \n\nobtained, by enhancing sintering. Maximum pressures over 100 Pa were measured during \n\nthe decompositions, as can be seen in Figure II-5 in page 50, which according to J. Ewing \n63, can lower the SSA. This reduction of surface area is due to the catalytic effect of CO2 \n\non the sintering of the samples. 63 The improvement of the vacuum conditions in this work \n\n(with the change of the powder support from porous to denser parts and other adjustment \n\nin valves and o-rings), led to the attaining of SSA and XS closer to those in the literature \n\nvalues, as can be exemplified by sample N80 when compared with D80 (higher pressure, \n\nsee Table III-1).  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFigure III-2 \u2013 SEM Microstructure of the CaCO 3  powder (a), the N80 sample (b), a high resolution SEM at the \nN80 sample (c) and STEM done to N80 sample (d).  \n\nThe sample D10 (as shown in Table III-1) was synthesized at 1000oC for a longer \n\ntime (48h), to approximate the calcination conditions previously used at ISOLDE. 9 As \n\na) b) \n\n2\u00b5m 2\u00b5m \n\n120nm 250nm \n\nc) \n\nN80 - SEM CaCO3 \n\nN80 - SEM N80 - STEM \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n64 \n\n \n\nexpected, lower values of SSA and higher values of XS were obtained, but the material \n\nwas still able to keep its nanometric size. \n\nSEM and STEM was used to analyse the microstructure of the N80 powder, as \n\npresented in Figure III-2. Observing the microstructures of the raw material in the Figure \n\nIII-2 a) and the N80 sample in Figure III-2 b), the decomposition reaction can be classified \n\nas pseudomorphous due to the small changes in the particle size and shape. This was also \n\nobserved by D. Beruto 54 and others 55,49,63. The CaO powder presents a higher degree of \n\nagglomeration and rounded edges that may come either from hydration during handling \n\nor/and transport to the microscope 68. \n\nThe CaO nanograins were hard to see in SEM. The apparent orange-peel roughness \n\nobserved at the surface of the particles in the SEM microstructure of Figure III-2 c), and in \n\nthe STEM observation of a thin agglomerate in Figure III-2 d), was reported to correspond \n\nto the image of nanosized CaO grains 55. The SEM and STEM observations permit to \n\nconclude that the CaO powder is constituted by agglomerates of identical shape and size as \n\nthe initial CaCO3 particles and that these agglomerates are constituted by nanograins \n\nsmaller than 70 nm. The particles seem to be more like plate shaped, agreeing with what \n\nwas observed for CaO powder obtained by CaCO3 in other studies 50,64.The porosity inside \n\nthe agglomerates couldn\u2019t be resolved by SEM. \n\n  \nFigure III-3 \u2013 TEM observations of CaO sample, N80. \n\nBy taking a look in the TEM micrographs presented in Figure III-3, the cubic \n\nshaped CaO agglomerates can be observed in the left and on the right a high magnification \n\nimage shows that they are constituted by very fine grains, confirming the previous \n\nobservation in SEM/STEM.

Assuming that the reaction is pseudomorphous \n\nand taking the molar volumes of CaO and CaCO3 one could expect a porosity of ~55%. \n\nThis is probably related to some sintering either of CaCO3 before the decomposition 56 or \n\nof the CaO during the calcination, possibly catalyzed by the presence of the CO2 resultant \n\nfrom the decomposition 55. \n\nIII.1.2 Reactivity in Air \n\nAs stated in section I.4.3, the calcium oxide reacts, spontaneously, with H2O and \n\nCO2 in air. The high surface area of the CaO powders in this study will enhance the \n\nreactivity, as reported by D. Beruto 66 and E. Powel 61, affecting powder characteristics. \n\nTherefore, the kinetics of the reaction between the nanometric CaO powder and air and the \n\neffect on the powder characteristics needs to be investigated, prior to the powder \n\nprocessing.  \n\nIn order to know the extent of the hydration/carbonation reactions, DTA/TGA tests \n\nunder Ar flow, were done in N80 sample, as shown in the Figure III-6 a) after normal \n\nhandling* and b) intentionally left at air for 2 days.  \n\nAs can be seen in the TGA curve presented in Figure III-6 a), the sample, after \n\nnormal handling, keeps reacting until 330oC (rise in weight of 1.2%). This is probably due \n\nto residual water/carbon dioxide coming from its surface (adsorbed), from the gas bottle \n\n(residuals) or even air leaks in the system. Around 400oC the decomposition of Ca(OH)2 is \n\nhappening (DTA endothermic peak and TGA loss of mass). The %H2O is about 4.5 wt.% \n\nwhich corresponds (equation (I.24)) to a conversion of ~18 wt.% of CaO in Ca(OH)2 \n\nduring air exposure. Similarly, from the slight weight loss (~2%) around 600oC, which is \n\nmost likely due to loss of CO2 (%CO2) due to the CaCO3 decomposition, one can estimate \n\n~4 wt.% (from the reaction (I.25)) of carbonate in CaO. In the XRD of the powder after \n\n                                                 \n* A \u201cnormal handled\u201d CaO powder corresponds to an exposure at air variable between 5 and 10min, \n\ndue to the purge and opening of the calcination furnace, weighting and transport to the desiccator.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \nChapter III \u2013 Results and Discussion  \n\n67 \n\n \n\nnormal handling (Figure III-7 a)) no CaCO3 and only small traces of Ca(OH)2 were \n\ndetected. D. Glasson 83 reported that values up to 20 wt.% of Ca(OH)2 in reacted CaO \n\ncouldn\u2019t be detected in XRD. He attributes this to a fast reaction which has a time lag in \n\nrecrystallization, giving a poorly crystalline phase. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure III-6 - Thermal analysis of the N80 sample after decomposition and normal handling (a) and after \nintentional exposure at air for 2 days (b). \n\nFrom the DTA/TGA of the Figure III-6 b) the total weight loss (~32%), is \n\nequivalent to the weight gain after air reaction for 2 days (~49 wt.%) by changing the base \n\nof calculation from reacted CaO mass to non-reacted one. From the DTA/TGA curves, the \n\nCaO hydration and carbonation extent are calculated to be ~70 wt.% and ~30 wt.%, \n\nrespectively (correcting already for weight loss due to adsorbed molecules from 60 to \n\n250oC, as seen in the TGA curve of Figure III-6 b)). These results are consistent with the \n\nXRD results (see Figure III-7 b)), where no peaks of CaO were detected, confirming the \n\ndepletion of CaO, and the intense peaks of Ca(OH)2, whereas only small CaCO3 peaks are \n\ndetected. \n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n\nD\nTA\n\n (\u00b5\nV\n\n) \n\nW\nei\n\ngh\nt \n\nLo\nss\n\n (%\n) \n\nTemperature (oC) \n\nTGA\nDTA\n\nCa(OH)2 \n\n-7\n-6\n-5\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n\n-35\n\n-30\n\n-25\n\n-20\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n\nD\nTA\n\n (\u00b5\nV\n\n) \n\nW\nei\n\ngh\nt \n\nLo\nss\n\n (%\n) \n\nTemperature (\u00baC) \n\nTG\n\nDTA\n\na) \n\nb) \n\nCaCO3 \n\nCa(OH)\n2\n CaCO3 \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n68 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure III-7 - XRD of the N80 powder after normal handling (a) and left at air for 2 days (b). \n\nTo study the rate and extent of the CaO reaction in air, three samples of different \n\ninitial SSA (25, 47 and 59 m2/g) were left at air during Summer time and periodically \n\nweighted. The results are presented the Figure III-8 a). \n\n \nFigure III-8 - Plot of the weight gain over two days for three samples of CaO with different initial surface areas (a) \nand respective amplification for shorter times (b). The dotted line represents the weight gain if the powder would \nbe completely hydrated.  \n\nIt can be seen that the kinetics of the reactivity of the CaO in air is divided in two \n\nregimes: the initial one with a higher reaction rate, until ~5h, and another slower for longer \n\ntimes. As expected the powders with higher SSA were the most reactive ones, gaining \n\nweight faster and attaining larger values of weight gain which are probably related with the \n\ninterference of the adsorption phenomena. After 2 days, the weight gain was unnoticeable \n\nfor all the samples, indicating that the reaction was finished. In order to confirm this \n\nDTA/TGA would have done, to check for CaO for the samples (47 and 25 m2/g). The fast \n\nhydration when exposed to air, of high surface area CaO powders was previously reported \n\nby other authors 54,61 but nothing was referred about carbonation in their studies.

The \n\nrate of weight gain is, in average, ~0.3 wt.% min-1. If one, considers this weight gain for \n\nshorter times to be essentially due to hydration, the average \u201chydration rate\u201d can be \n\nroughly defined as 1 wt.% min-1 of conversion of CaO into Ca(OH)2. \n\nFrom the above results and using some speculation, the reaction of CaO with air \n\ncan be described by the following steps: (i) as soon as CaO is in contact with air, it reacts \n\nboth with H2O (equation (I.24)) and CO2 (equation (I.25)) to form spontaneously at the \n\nsame time respectively, Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3. It also starts to adsorb, gaining additional \n\nweight. As shown before, the hydration reaction dominates the faster regime; (ii) as soon \n\nas Ca(OH)2 is formed, another spontaneous (accordingly to thermodynamics) reaction can \n\nstart to form CaCO3 from the hydrate (equation (I.26)); (iii) when most of the CaO is \n\nconsumed by the hydration reaction, the slower regime starts: the reaction of carbonation is \n\nknown to form a low porous product slowing down and preventing further reaction 71. As \n\nthe reaction progresses more and more, and CaCO3 is being formed, it creates an \n\nimpermeable layer, slowing down the process and eventually stopping the transformation \n\nof Ca(OH)2 into CaCO3. \n\nSince it was observed that during the hydration of CaO there is also carbonation the \n\nchosen temperature to test reversibility and to accomplish complete conversion back to \n\nCaO needs to be high enough to decompose the formed CaCO3. The selected temperature \n\nwas 800oC and different times at this temperature were tested. Results for powder \n\ncharacteristics before and after the hydration and reversibility thermal tests can be seen in \n\nthe Table III-2. \nTable III-2 \u2013 Powder characteristics before and after air exposure and reversibility thermal tests. \n\nConditions \nBET \n\nXS (nm) Main Phase \n\nCa(OH) 2 detected CaCO 3 detected \nSSA \n\n(m2/g) \nGBET \n(nm) DTA/TGA XRD DTA/TGA XRD \n\nInitial Powder 59 31 33 CaO ~18% Yes ~2% No \nLeft at Air (2d) 9 - - Ca(OH) 2 ~70% Yes ~30% Yes \n\n800\u00baC, 5mn 34 52 29 CaO ~12% Traces&lt;2% No \n800\u00baC, 15mn 28 64 32 CaO ~16% Traces&lt;4.5% No \n800\u00baC, 40mn 22 82 33 CaO ~12% Traces&lt;2% No \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n70 \n\n \n\nFrom the presented results it can be seen that the initial material is not totally \n\nrecovered in terms of surface area, although the crystallite size is almost the same as that of \n\nthe initial powder. The SSA decreases significantly during the powder exposure and \n\nincreases after the thermal treatment, although, the attained values are less than half of the \n\ninitial SSA. The time increase at 800oC brings a fast reduction of the SSA values. Not \n\nenough studies were made in this work to assess the sintering kinetics of the CaO obtained \n\nfrom Ca(OH)2 but the literature reports higher sintering rates than the one produced from \n\nCaCO3 74. \n\nTo evaluate the difference in the microstructure of the material, SEM analysis was \n\ndone before the powder was left at air and after the thermal treatment. The differences seen \n\nin the micrographs were not conclusive enough, but in the literature the hydration reaction \n\nis reported to be followed by a volume expansion 70, which would change the morphology \n\nof the microstructure. \n\nIII.1.3 Sintering Kinetics of CaO \n\nIn order to study the thermal behavior of the CaO powders, pressed compacts with \n\na relative density, ?0=0.4, were used. Several thermal treatments (TT) were done in a high \n\nvacuum furnace using atmosphere and temperature conditions close to those used during \n\ntarget operation. The samples were handled* in order to minimize contact with air, to \n\nenhance the reproducibility of the results. Even though all the precautions were taken an \n\nerror of ~20% is expected from the obtained results, due to some air exposure. \n\n \nFigure III-9 - Plot of the specific surface area versus the temperature for 3 min and 10h of thermal treatment.

From \n\nthis plot it can be observed that for T>1000oC there are net sintering effects which brings a \n\nsignificant surface area reduction from the initial powder (more than one half, in the case \n\nof 10h at 1200oC).  \n\nIt was possible to apply the German and Munir model 73 to the values of SSA at \n\n1200oC by fitting equation (I.27), through iterations, finding S0 and ? as represented in \n\nFigure III-10. \n\n \nFigure III-10 - Plot of the surface areas versus temperature for several temperature and respective fits. \n\nThe obtained value for the kinetic exponent, ?, was 2.1. By checking Table I-4 it \n\ncan be seen that for Nc=4, ?0=0.32, close to the fractional density, ?0=0.4, of the green \n\ncompacts, the determined ? value lies between 1.6 for the mechanism of evaporation-\n\ncondensation and 2.7 corresponding to volume diffusion. \n\nSince at 1200oC the SSA values were the ones that were obtained with less \n\nscattering, the exponent ?=2.1, determined at that temperature, was assumed for the \n\nvariation of SSA at lower temperatures. The calculated curves could reasonably fit the \n\npoints, as seen in Figure III-10 (values of R2 from the fit are presented). This means that \n\nthe same mechanism may control the matter transport for sintering. From the same plot, it \n\ncan be seen that the higher degree of sintering happens at 1200oC, and at 1000oC and \n\n1100oC the sintering rate is much lower, as expected from a thermal activated mechanism \n\nas diffusion is. \n\nTo help the identification of the controlling mechanism of matter transport, the \n\nlinear shrinkage (?l/l0) at 1200oC was determined for the pressed samples. The diameter \n\nvalues are plotted versus time at 1200oC, Figure III-11, accordingly to equation (I.29).  \n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700\n\nSS\nA\n\n (\nm\n\n2 /\ng)\n\n \n\ntime (min) \n\n1200\u00baC\n1100\u00baC\n1000\u00baC\n\nS0,1000\u00baC =49,0m2/g \nS0,1100\u00baC =47,7m2/g \nS0,1200\u00baC =46,1m2/g \n\n \n \n\nR2=0.953 \n\nR2=0.800 \n\nR2=0.794 \n?1200\u00baC =2.1 \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n72 \n\n \n\n \nFigure III-11 - Plot of the diameter variation with time at 1200oC. \n\nSince this model also applies for isothermal conditions, l0 was also taken from the \n\nfit. Figure III-11 shows that the reduction of SSA is accompanied by shrinkage of the \n\ncompact (a maximum value of ?l/l0=2.7% was obtained at 600 min). This observation \n\nleads to the conclusion that the sintering mechanism can be identified with volume \n\ndiffusion, since evaporation-condensation doesn\u2019t bring densification of the compact. \n\nFurthermore, the determined value for the kinetic exponent is s=1.96, and by comparing \n\nthis result to the theoretical ones in the Table I-4, one can further confirm that the sintering \n\nmechanism is identified with volume diffusion (s=2). This conclusion is consistent with the \n\nstudies of R.

A CaO \n\npowder target (T12) was produced from the CaCO3 used in the past (CC2) and following \n\nsynthesis conditions named \u201cold procedure\u201d (detailed in section II.6.1, page 53).

The obtained results can be seen in Table III-3.  \nTable III-3 \u2013 Characterization of the CaO powders produced at ISOLDE, by the old target production method \nbefore (T12) and after a thermal treatment at 1200oC, 48h (S12). \n\nSample Conditions \nSSA \n\n(m2/g) \nGBET \n(nm) \n\nXS \n(nm) \n\nPore Size \n(nm) \n\nPorosity \n(%) \n\nT12 - Center \nCC2 with \u201cold procedure\u201d \n\n25 71 46 11 33 \nT12 - Side 40 45 40 8 38 \n\nS12 T12 - Center at 1200oC for 48h 3.8 478 330 9 9 \n \n\nThe difference between the center and side T12 samples is probably due to the \n\nthermal gradient in the target oven. Despite the high temperatures used, a nanometric \n\npowder was obtained. The difference between the samples T12 \u2013 Center and S12 show \n\nhigh sintering of the CaO powder: larger crystallite size, and a pore size and volume \n\ndecrease. These results can explain the bad performance of these targets after some time of \n\noperation. \n\nA sample of CaO (sample T80 in Table III-4) with the actual carbonate powder and \n\nthe \u201cnew procedure\u201d was prepared with equivalent thermal cycle conditions (temperature \n\nand time) of those used in University of Aveiro (UA), N80, to assess if the synthesis \n\nprocess was reproducible at ISOLDE. \nTable III-4 \u2013 Characterization of the CaO powders produced at ISOLDE, using the new targets procedure (T80 \nand S80 and comparison with CaO powder obtained at UA (N80).  \n\nSample Conditions \nSSA \n\n(m2/g) \nGBET \n(nm) \n\nXS \n(nm) \n\nPore Size \n(nm) \n\nPorosity \n(%) \n\nN80 800oC for 2h at UA 58\u00b14 31\u00b13 32\u00b12 12 44 \nT80 800oC for 2h at ISOLDE 42 43 - 20 47 \nS80 800oC for 48h at ISOLDE 37 48 37 23 47 \n\n \n\nThere are some differences between the powder samples produced in UA and in \n\nISOLDE, most probably due to the different equipment used to produce the CaO. A finer \n\nCaO is obtained through the \u201cnew process\u201d as expected already (smaller grain size, higher \n\nsurface area, porosity and pore volume). A long duration calcination cycle, 800oC, for 48h, \n\nwas also done, sample S80, Table III-4, and small changes in the microstructural \n\ncharacteristics were observed when comparing it with sample T80, showing that the \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \nChapter III \u2013 Results and Discussion  \n\n75 \n\n \n\nproduced microstructure is relatively stable at 800oC. From these results, the online \n\noperation temperature of this target was set to a maximum of 800oC. The new target \n\nmaterial doesn\u2019t comply with the defined requirement of pore size 7,8 (>100 nm comparing \n\nto the obtained 20 nm), but this parameter is hard to control since it is characteristic of the \n\nCaCO3 decomposition. One can also see that the CaO obtained from the \u201cnew procedure\u201d \n\n(Table III-4) is finer and has larger pore size and volume than the one produced through \n\nthe \u201cold procedure\u201d (Table III-3). The CC2 was also a coarser and less pure raw material. \n\nA nanostructured material was already produced before at ISOLDE (as seen in the \n\nreproduced results in Table III-3), but this nanostructure was most of the times lost \n\ndepending how the material was produced, handled and operated. Since no study or \n\nknowledge about this material didn\u2019t exist (or was lost) and since production, degas and \n\nhandling phases were not controlled, it would be a coincidence for all the conditions to be \n\ncombined in order to obtain a material with good release properties of isotopes. This \n\nexplains the (sometimes) good isotope yields for this target, and the reported drop on them, \n\nmeaning that the target was being heated to high, degrading the microstructure and so the \n\nyields over time.  \n\nA new target material was then produced according to \u201cthe new procedure\u201d \n\n(detailed in section II.6.2 on page 54), and the new target was labeled with the reference \n\nCaO#469. The sample S80 (in Table III-4) was extracted from the center of the container, \n\nwhile the side sample indicated a very low surface area (4.5m2/g) and also the XRD \n\nshowed CaCO3 peaks only, stating only little or no decomposition. This is again a sign of a \n\nthermal gradient between the center and the side of the target oven. In section III.1.1, \n\ntemperature influence studies on the CaCO3 decomposition were done. This was further \n\nconfirmed when weighting the Re boat, showing that the reaction was 95% complete, \n\nmeaning that only a little quantity didn\u2019t decompose. \n\nThe material was transferred from the oven to the target container, in a gloves box \n\nunder an Argon atmosphere in order to avoid exposure to air. This method proved to be \n\neffective, since no peaks from the Ca(OH)2 phase were detected in the XRD, unlike most \n\nof the tests done in this study. \n\nIn this target unit, an inverse gradient to the one of the oven is formed. The \n\ntemperature is lower at the center and higher at the sides as measured by two \n\nthermocouples. This was caused by a water cooled copper block around the transfer line \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n76 \n\n \n\n(see Figure I-4) in the center. As soon as temperatures approached 500oC at the sides of the \n\ncontainer, there was a sudden increase of the pressure (up to 10-1 Pa), showing the \n\ndecomposition of the remaining CaCO3, which was completed after 50 min as the pressure \n\nwent back to initial low pressures. \n\nAfterwards, the normal procedure followed up (offline operation and outgassing for \n\n3 days) at temperatures lower than 800oC to avoid any nanostructure degradation. \n\nIII.3 Online Studies \n\nIn order to test the impact of a nanostructure on the isotope release properties with \n\nrespect of other calcium oxide targets, a benchmark of this material was obtained by \n\ntesting the new unit CaO#469 in comparison with others previously used at ISOLDE. The \n\nrelease curves for several isotopes were monitored. Yields on 35Ar were probed throughout \n\nthe target run to check for possible yields drop. Also, release curves for 35Ar and 19Ne at 3 \n\ndifferent target temperatures were taken in order to assess effusion and diffusion properties \n\nof the material. The release efficiency was calculated with values obtained from other CaO \n\ntargets used before at ISOLDE. \n\nIII.3.1 Isotope Yields \n\nThe yields for 6He, 10,15C, 19Ne, 31-33Ar and 35Ar were measured and compared with \n\na database compiling historical data of the best targets produced at ISOLDE 45, as seen in \n\nTable III-5. \nTable III-5 \u2013 Measured yields and respective conditions for target CaO#469 and the comparison with database \nyields. \n\nIsotope \u2013 T1/2 \nTemperatures (oC) Yield \n\n(ions/\u00b5C) \nDatabase Yield (ions/\u00b5C), Target \nTemperature (oC) and Target Unit 45 Ion Source Target \n\n6He \u2013 806.7ms 1970 650 2.3x106 2.6x106 (1050oC) - CaO#123 \n10C (CO) \u2013 19.3s 1970 730 6.1x105 5.3x105 (1050oC) - CaO#123 \n15C (CO) \u2013 2.45s 1970 730 7.0x103 6.2x103 \u2013 SC Target \n\n19Ne \u2013 17.22s 1970 650 9.6x106 7.5x106 (1050oC) - CaO#123 \n31Ar \u2013 15.1ms 1970 650 4.2x101 5.0x100 (>1050oC) - CaO#408 \n\n32Ar \u2013 98ms 1970 650 2.4x103 3.3x103 (1050oC) - CaO#123 \n33Ar \u2013 174.1ms 1970 650 1.3x105 3.8x104 (1050oC) - CaO#123 \n\n35Ar \u2013 1.78s 2070 840 2.0x108 4.3x107 (1050oC) - CaO#123 \n \n\nTable III-5, shows a match or a significant increase of the yields of CaO#469 for \n\nmost of the isotopes, versus the database yields. One of the main differences is the \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \nChapter III \u2013 Results and Discussion  \n\n77 \n\n \n\ntemperature at which the target CaO#469 operated, relatively to the old targets. Since \n\nproton impact effect at ISOLDE is unknown for this material, the temperature was set to \n\n650oC as regular operation temperature in order to partially compensate for the spike \n\nheating caused by the proton pulses. Whenever the target temperature was risen, it was \n\nonly for the measurement in question, being lowered right away. \n\nClear improvement was obtained on 35Ar yield, being 5 times superior to the one in \n\nthe database, and the highest in all history of ISOLDE. This is consistent with the previous \n\nhypothesis that a controlled microstructure (nanostructure), leads to better yields. The good \n\nvalue for 35Ar is even underestimated since part of the release curve was cut away, and \n\nonly partly compensated by the fitting program.  The 31Ar yield measurement is probably \n\nthe best achievement, being 8 times higher than database values, confirming again that a \n\nmicrostructure with smaller grains which have shorter diffusion lengths enhances the \n\nrelease, as will be discussed further ahead. The measured yields for 31,33,35Ar and 10C were \n\nall higher than database values, compared to any of the target materials used so far at \n\nISOLDE. 19Ne and 15C isotope yields were the highest of all CaO past target units. Most of \n\nthe yields were obtained with conservative running parameters to preserve the target \n\nnanostructure, which means that probably they can be further enhanced by increasing the \n\ntarget operation temperature, without compromising it. \n\nThe high yields, on the measured isotopes on the database 45, were mostly provided \n\nby target CaO#123 operated in 1999. Since then, these results were hard to reproduce \n\nmainly for the reasons detailed before (section III.2). The results of target CaO#123 were \n\nprobably of such a good quality due to the use of a different production process 9, \n\ndecomposing the CaCO3 at a lower temperature (1000oC, instead of 1200oC used \n\nafterwards) in a single batch instead of 2, obtaining smaller grain sizes. Additionally, lower \n\noperation temperatures were used (1050oC), helping to keep the microstructure for longer \n\ntimes, comparing with other standard CaO targets which were operated at temperatures \n\nbetween 1050 and 1150oC 45 and also at 1340oC 9. \n\nIII.3.2 Yields Over Time \n\nThe CaO targets at ISOLDE, are reported to have low yields of exotic Ar isotopes \n\nfrom the beginning, or a fast drop when operated under proton irradiation. In this work it is \n\nshown that it can be avoided by maintaining the microstructure without significant \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n78 \n\n \n\ndegradation due to sintering. An example of a relative drop on the yields for precedent \n\ntargets is shown in Figure III-14 for 31,32Ar. \n\n \nFigure III-14 - Yield evolution on 32Ar on target CaO#191 in 2001 at ISOLDE (courtesy of Susanne Kreim) and \n31Ar in CaO#408. \n\nAs can be seen in Figure III-14, the yields dropped to 30% of the initial value in \n\nonly 15h of operation time. The yield of this isotope is a good benchmark of the \n\nmicrostructure degradation since it is very short lived (98ms), so any increase on the grain \n\nsize would increase the diffusion lengths that would directly affect the total release of 32Ar. \n\nOn another target, CaO#408, the yield on 31Ar dropped by a factor 5 from 5 ions/\u00b5C after 8 \n\nhours of operation time. On the new target, CaO#469, the yields on the very short lived \n\nisotopes (31-33Ar) were measured after 80 hours of operation. The measured numbers \n\nproved to be higher than in any previous target (especially for 31Ar, see Figure III-14), but \n\nno measurements along time could be done. \n\nThe yield of 35Ar was taken throughout the run, for target CaO#469, and compared \n\nto the yield drop on a standard target (CaO#419) as can be seen in Figure III-15. \n\n \nFigure III-15 - Yields of 35Ar measured throughout the run for targets CaO#469 and CaO#419. \n\n0%\n\n20%\n\n40%\n\n60%\n\n80%\n\n100%\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16\n\nRe\nla\n\nti\nve\n\n A\nr \n\nYi\nel\n\nd \n\nTime (h) \n\n32Ar, CaO#191\n31Ar, CaO#408\n\n1E+6\n\n1E+7\n\n1E+8\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\n\nYi\nel\n\nd \n(io\n\nns\n/?\n\nC)\n \n\nOperation time (h) \n\nCaO#469\n\nCaO#419\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \nChapter III \u2013 Results and Discussion  \n\n79 \n\n \n\nA drop of ~80% on the yield could be noticed on target CaO#419 after 120h, most \n\nprobably related with the material microstructure degradation, even though this isotope is \n\nnot a very short-lived one. On target CaO#469, one notices that, the yields are higher and \n\nthere is no drop until the end of the run.  \n\nThe stable yield indicates that the calcium oxide microstructure is stable. A \n\nconfirmation of this comes with the measurement of the very short lived isotopes, 31-33Ar \n\nafter 80 hours of operation. This means that the used settings (650oC and 8x1012 protons \n\nper pulse) are appropriate to obtain stable CaO release properties, even though the \n\ntemperature was risen to 730oC and 840oC for some hours to do some of the \n\nmeasurements. Since there was no degradation of the target release properties, studies with \n\nhigher temperatures and/or proton intensities can be done in the future in order to provide \n\nbetter yields for beams delivered to experiments. \n\nIII.3.3 Isotope Release Properties \n\nThe calcium oxide release properties were assessed by measuring delay curves of \n35Ar, on targets CaO#469 and CaO#419 and fitted accordingly with equation (I.2) and the \n\nresults are presented in Table III-6. \n\nParameters of the curves obtained at 950oC for target CaO#419 are shown in table \n\nTable III-6, in which the 35Ar yields dropped to 20% of the initial value during the run. In \n\nthe case of CaO#469 the overall yields are higher, but the release (as can be seen by tr, tf  \n\nand ts in Table III-6) seems to be slower. This shows that the apparent time constants (tr, tf \n\nand ts) are not easily related to effusion and diffusion phenomena and their time constants. \nTable III-6 - Release time constants obtained by fitting the data with equation (I.2) for target CaO#419 and \nCaO#469 for 35Ar. \n\nTarget \nTemperature \n\n(oC) \n\n35ArYield \n(ions/\u00b5C) \n\ntr (s) tf (s) ts (s) \n\nCaO#419 \n\n950 (run start) 9.0x106 0.079 0.206 1.429 \n950 (run end) 1.6x106 0.052 0.053 0.806 \n500 (run end) 2.8x105 0.030 0.095 0.606 \n680 (run end) 4.1x105 0.038 0.062 0.511 \n\nCaO#469 \n520 8.9x106 0.120 0.293 1.851 \n730 3.9x107 0.126 0.408 1.805 \n\n \n\nIn Table III-7, for target CaO#469 the release efficiency of 35Ar increases with the \n\ntemperature.

For CaO#419, which represents a standard ISOLDE CaO target, the \n\nrelease efficiency for 35Ar is 1/5 of that of CaO#469, and it decays over the run to 1/35. For \n\nthe very short lived isotopes, the release efficiency is higher in the case of CaO#469, than \n\nother targets (CaO#123 and CaO#408). Surprisingly, the same could not be seen for 32Ar. \nTable III-7 - Calculation of the release efficiency for Ar isotopes for the target CaO#469 and other older targets. \nY prod  calculated from ABRABLA simulation for the different target thicknesses. \n\nTarget Isotope \u2013 T1/2 \nTemperature \n\n(oC) \n?is (%) \n\nYprod \n(ions/\u00b5C) \n\nYobs \n(ions/\u00b5C) \n\n?rel(%) \n\nCaO#469 \n\n31Ar \u2013 15.1ms \n650 \n\n 3.2x104 4.2x101 0.9 \n32Ar \u2013 98ms  1.1x106 2.4x103 1.6 \n\n33Ar \u2013 173ms 14.0 2.0x107 1.2x105 4.3 \n\n35Ar \u2013 1.78s \n\n520 7.2 \n\n3.4x109 \n\n8.9x106 3.6 \n650 8.0 3.5x107 12.9 \n730 6.1 3.9x107 19.2 \n840 19.4 2.0x108 29.8 \n\nCaO#123 \n\n31Ar \u2013 15.1ms \n\n1050 9 \n\n1.8x104 1.5x100 0.1 \n32Ar \u2013 98ms 6.2x105 3.3x103 5.9 \n\n33Ar \u2013 173ms 1.1x107 3.8x104 3.8 \n35Ar \u2013 1.78s 1.9x109 4.3x107 25.1 \n\nCaO#408 31Ar \u2013 15.1ms >1050 21 2.0x104 5.0x100 0.1 \n\nCaO#419 35Ar \u2013 1.78s \n950 (run \nbegin) 8 1.8x109 \n\n9.0x106 6.2 \n\n950 (run end) 1.9x106 1.3 \n \n\nIt is important to note that the ?rel of the isotopes produced by CaO#123 are \n\nsomehow close to the ones produced by CaO#469, at different operation temperatures with \n\nthe exception of 31Ar. Nevertheless, this shows that the good performance of these old \n\ntargets (CaO#123) is possibly related, as explained before, to a better controlled \n\nmicrostructure. However degradation of the initial microstructure was experienced due to \n\nhigher operation temperatures. \n\nIII.3.4 Diffusion and Effusion of Isotopes \n\nDiffusion and effusion parameters can be extracted from the experimental release \n\nefficiency (equation (I.5)) of isotopes with different half-lives, using a fit of equation \n\n(I.19). To calculate the diffusion coefficient, the equation (I.17) was used and a particle \n\nsize of 40 nm was considered from the sample S80, considered to be representative of the \n\ntarget material (see Table III-4, on page 74). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \nChapter III \u2013 Results and Discussion  \n\n81 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure III-16 \u2013 Example of release curve and respective fit, from equation (I.2), for 35Ar at 520oC (a) and release \nefficiency obtained through the fitting of the experimental release curves of 35Ar for three different temperatures \n(b) in target CaO#469. \n\nA representative example of a release curve fit of 35Ar can be seen in Figure III-16 \n\na). It can be seen that the fitted function does not match the first part of the release curve, \n\nwhich normally corresponds to where effusion phenomena is predominant. This induces an \n\ninconsistency later when obtaining the release efficiency curves, as can be seen in Figure \n\nIII-16 b), where the release efficiency should be higher as higher is the temperature \n\nbecause effusion and diffusion rates are faster, improving the release efficiency. This \n\nespecially fails in the case of the release efficiency at 520oC, also confirmed by the values \n\nin Table III-8. \nTable III-8 - Fitted effusion and diffusion parameters for 35Ar for three different temperatures on target \nCaO#469. \n\nTemperature (oC) Yield (ions/\u00b5C) v1 (s\n-1) v2 (s\n\n-1) \u00b5 (s-1) D (m2/s) \n520 8.9x106 160 2.13 5.22 1.6x10-16 \n650 3.5x107 155 4.47 0.22 9.1x10-18 \n730 3.9x107 144 3.59 0.29 1.2x10-17 \n \n\n1E+1\n\n1E+2\n\n1E+3\n\n1E+4\n\n1E+5\n\n1E+6\n\n1E+7\n\n0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100\n\nIo\nns\n\n (s\n-1\n\n) \n\nTime (s) \n\nFit\n\nData\n\n1E-3\n\n1E-2\n\n1E-1\n\n1E+0\n\n0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100\n\nRe\nle\n\nas\ne \n\nef\nfic\n\nie\nnc\n\ny \n\nT1/2 (s) \n\n520\u00baC\n\n650\u00baC\n\n730\u00baC\n\nT1/2=1.78s - 35Ar \n\n?rel~50% \n\na) \n\nb) \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n82 \n\n \n\nBy comparing the values of \u00b5 and calculated D (in Table III-8), one can see that \n\nthere is a logic tendency between the temperatures of 650oC and 730oC, which is not the \n\ncase at 520oC. For the values of v1 and v2 there is no large evolution, whereas these should \n\nget higher as the temperature is increased. It shows that the difference between the fit and \n\nthe data indeed affects the proper extraction of these parameters.  \n\nThe diffusion delay parameter was alternatively deduced from the release \n\nefficiency by using equations (I.20) and (I.21), neglecting contributions from effusion as \n\nshown in Table III-9. The values are expected to be lower estimates of \u00b5 and D, since all \n\nlosses are assumed to come from diffusion. \nTable III-9 - Obtained diffusion parameters (neglected contribution from effusion) through the release efficiency \nof 35Ar for three different temperatures on target CaO#469. \n\nTemperature (oC) ?is (%) \nY prod \n\n(ions/\u00b5C) \n?rel (%) \u00b5 (s-1) D (m\n\n2/s) \n\n520oC 7.2 \n\n3.4x109 \n\n3.6 0.00058 2.4x10-20 \n650oC 8.0 12.9 0.0078 3.19x10-19 \n730oC 6.1 19.2 0.018 7.4x10-19 \n840oC 19.4 29.8 0.047 1.9x10-18 \n\n \n\nBy looking at the values of \u00b5 in Table III-9, one can see that they are much lower \n\nthan those obtained in Table III-8. The difference results from the disagreement between \n\nthe release efficiencies determined by the two different methods (as seen in the values in \n\nTable III-9 and Figure III-16). These methods were already applied successfully before 37, \n\nwhich can means that a potentially error in the determination of the system efficiency \n\nmight be in play: (i) it was detected that part of the beam was not being totally separated \n\nand lost in the way before or in the separator; (ii) the ion source efficiency can also be \n\nanother source of the error since it can be overestimated, as seen already in past targets; \n\n(iii) experimental issues with the extraction and acceleration of the RIB were reported \n\nthroughout the release measurements. All of these can have a strong influence on the \n\nproper assessment of the release process and efficiencies during the experimental tests. \n\nAnother possible explanation may be related with a slow diffusion process (trapped or very \n\nslowly released Ar) which is in play (as shown in Table III-9 by the low values of\u00b5) which \n\ncannot be resolved by the current model, leading only to apparent diffusion values. \n\nAs expected the yield increases with the temperature, as can be seen in Table III-8.  \n\nThis is especially true in the case of diffusion which is the most limiting step, as can be \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \nChapter III \u2013 Results and Discussion  \n\n83 \n\n \n\nseen by the orders of diffusion and effusion time constants, v1, v2, and \u00b5 at 650oC and \n\n730oC. \n\nIn the case of 19Ne (T1/2=17.22s), a representative example of a fitted release curve \n\nis also shown in Figure III-17 a), which fit agrees generally well with the data. The \n\nresulting release curves show, as expected, in Figure III-17 b), higher efficiencies for \n\nhigher temperatures. \n\n \n\n \nFigure III-17 \u2013 Example of release curve and respective fit, from equation (I.2), for 19Ne at 520oC (a) Release \nefficiency obtained through the fitting of the experimental release curves of 19Ne for three different temperatures \nin target CaO#469. \n\nFrom the Table III-10 one can see that the values of v1 and \u00b5 are increasing as the \n\ntemperature increases, showing that temperature has a large influence on both diffusion \n\nand effusion. In the case of v1 the values are unrealistic because of the rising part on the \n\nrelease curve could not be experimentally determined (see Figure III-17 a)) and respective \n\ntr). \n\nCalculations about release efficiency, similar to those made in Table III-9, cannot \n\nbe done in the case of 19Ne, since the ion source efficiency was not known.

In both cases the release is limited by diffusion, except for the \n\ncases of the very short lived Ar isotopes, where it is also limited by effusion. Diffusion \n\ncoefficients are in the order of 10-17 m2/s for Neon and 10-18 m2/s for Argon (or between for \n\n10-20 and 10-19 m2/s) in calcium oxide between 520 and 730oC. This was expected since \n\nneon is a smaller atom than argon and since they are both noble gases, neon should diffuse \n\nfaster in the same matrix. The values of the diffusion delay time, \u00b5, obtained by E. \n\nBouquerel 35, were determined to be 1.79 s-1 for Ar in CaO at 1400oC. This value was taken \n\nin an old standard CaO target with a grain size at least one to two orders of magnitude \n\nlarger (as discussed before). The diffusion delay time parameter is also compensated by the \n\nmuch higher temperature used. Further knowledge about the data treatment and the grain \n\nsize would have to be known at this kind of temperatures for further conclusions. This \n\nvalue was also taken considering the equation (I.15), which is not for the spheres \n\ngeometry, but for infinite foils. The diffusion values obtained in this study can also be \n\ninfluenced by the proton irradiation generated defects in the crystal structure. The effusion \n\ndelay times obtained by E. Bouquerel 35 are 100 and 10.5 s-1, which are in the same order \n\nof magnitude of the ones obtained in this work.  \n\nThe values of diffusion coefficient of neon in aluminum oxide taken from the \n\nrelease fractions in a target for EURISOL 86, that is a close situation (neon in an oxide), \n\nthey were, for the temperatures of 1100oC and 1450oC, 1x10-17 m2/s and 7x10-17 m2/s, \n\nrespectively, which are very close to the ones obtained in this work. Furthermore from the \n\ndiffusion coefficients of helium in a beryllium oxide target operated at ISOLDE 37, which \n\nis also a noble gas in an oxide, for temperatures between 800oC and 1400oC the diffusion \n\ncoefficients were measured to be 10-13 to 10-14 m2/s, which are still some orders of \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \nChapter III \u2013 Results and Discussion  \n\n85 \n\n \n\nmagnitude higher than the ones obtained. Since helium is a much smaller atom than neon, \n\nand both are noble gases, helium diffusion coefficients are expected to be higher. Since the \n\nmatrix in both cases is different further comparisons are not attempted. \n\nFrom the calculated diffusion coefficients for 35Ar and 19Ne one can infer Q from \n\nequation (I.9) and the Arrhenius plot in Figure III-18. The calculated Q values are \n\npresented in Table III-11 for 35Ar and 19Ne. In the case of 35Ar it is presented only for the \n\nfirst method (equation (I.21)).  \n\n \nFigure III-18 - Plot of the ln(D) vs 1/T in order to determine D 0  and Q for \n\n19Ne and 35Ar (the latter by a different \nmethod. \n\nThe fit to obtain Q is acceptable since the values of R2 are close to 1 (Table III-11), \n\neven though there are few data points for each. It can be seen that the values of Q are low \n\ncompared to the global activation energies (not the case of 35Ar \u2013 equation (I.21)) obtained \n\nfor diffusion which are generally in the order of hundreds of kJ/mol 48. However in case of \n\nthe diffusion of Ne in GeO2 the reported activation energies in the temperature range of 37 \n\nto 400oC are comprised between 37 to 55 kJ mol-1 which are in the same order of \n\nmagnitude than the ones obtained in this work 48. \nTable III-11 - Values of Q and D 0  and respective R\n\n2 for 19Ne and 35Ar. \n\nIsotopes Q (kJ mol-1) R2 \n35Ar (equation (I.21)) 101 0.986 \n19Ne (equation (I.19)) 21 0.999 \n\n \n\nDespite the disagreement obtained on 35Ar, this is an attempt to take diffusion data \n\nout of online release curves.

One should know that there are other errors \n\nassociated to this method: grain size with direct impact on the values of D, since it is most \n\nprobable, because of the thermal gradients during production and operation that the grain \n\nsize varies. Another source of error can be the operation temperature which is not \n\nhomogeneous throughout the target material. Further attempts in the future should be taken \n\nto explore and improve this process to study diffusion on target materials. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n87 \n\n \n\nChapter IV  - Conclusions \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter IV - Conclusions  \n\n89 \n\n \n\nIV.1 Conclusions \n\nFrom the decomposition of CaCO3 micrometric powder in vacuum (p?1 Pa), at \n\ntemperatures higher than 550oC, a mesoporous and nanometric (?40 nm) powder could be \n\nobtained. For the same vacuum conditions, the powder crystallite size is lower and the \n\nsurface area is higher as lower is the temperature used in the calcination process. The \n\nobtained CaO powders proved also to be very reactive in air to H2O and CO2 gases and \n\nspecial care was needed to be taken in storage and transport.  \n\nThe vacuum sintering studies in nanometric CaO showed that the surface area has a \n\nnet decrease from 1000oC which is accompanied by shrinkage. The kinetic analysis of the \n\nsintering results points to volume diffusion as controlling mechanism of matter transport \n\nduring sintering at 1000-1200oC. The apparent activation energy was determined to be 155 \n\nkJ mol-1 close to the value of diffusion of Ca in CaO monocrystals, in the literature. From \n\nthis study, one can also conclude that the temperatures used before for the target operation \n\nat ISOLDE, T>1050oC, degrade the CaO microstructure. \n\nThe CaO target material at ISOLDE-CERN was investigated. Based on the \n\nsynthesis, reactivity and sintering results, changes were proposed for the production, \n\noperation and handling of the target material. The target was produced and operated at \n\nlower temperatures (T<800oC) and special care was taken due to the very fast hydration of \n\nthis material. \n\nThe performance of the as produced CaO target material proved to be much higher \n\nand stable than standard CaO targets. The obtained yields for 31-33,35Ar, 19Ne, 6He, 10,15C \n\nwere higher than recent CaO targets, also higher or equivalent to the old (from 1999) CaO \n\ntargets, and sometimes higher than any other target. No drop of the yields was seen. These \n\nresults showed that choosing synthesis conditions to get a nanometric CaO powder and \n\nkeeping its nanostructure during handling and operation, the release properties could be \n\nmaintained over time. \n\nBy applying a mathematical model taking into account effusion and diffusion \n\nphysical phenomena in the release curves at different temperatures, information on these \n\nparameters, for 19Ne and 35Ar in CaO, was extracted. As expected the diffusion times are \n\nmuch higher than effusion times, and diffusion is limiting most of the release. Diffusion \n\ncoefficients were found to be in the order of 10-17m2/s for Neon and in between 10-20 and \n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n\n \n\n90 \n\n \n\n10-18m2/s for Argon in calcium oxide between 520 and 730oC. Activation energies for \n\ndiffusion of Ne in CaO were found to be 21 kJ mol-1 and of Ar in CaO to be 101 kJ mol-1. \n\nIV.2 Outlook \n\nA good improvement of the release properties of the calcium oxide as target \n\nmaterial was achieved with this study. The target material development in this work is not \n\nonly important to ISOLDE, but also for all other ISOL facilities throughout the world. \n\nFurther investigation can still be done to further improve the release properties. \n\nThe improvements on this target material, permitted the WITCH experiment (Weak \n\nInteration Trap for Charged particles) at ISOLDE to obtain a yield good enough on 35Ar \n\nand have results with good statistics, which they were attempting, unsuccessfully, for the \n\nlast couple of years. It also improved the yield of the very exotic Ar isotopes which can be \n\nused for future experiments. \n\nA nanometric material yet finer can be produced, but the sintering rates of this \n\nmaterial, since it will be more reactive, have to be assessed before online operation. A \n\ngood balance must be reached in terms of the nanostructured characteristics of the material \n\nand the temperature of online of operation, since both influences the diffusion times. \n\nFurther studies on the limit operation temperature should be made, in order to keep the \n\nmicrostructure over time and tentatively increase the yields. \n\nIn this study, the CaO reactivity in air was only studied in order to prevent it. \n\nFurther studies can still be done in this subject, especially in the kinetics of the reactions in \n\nair atmosphere, and determine when, with precision, either is the hydration or the \n\ncarbonation reaction predominant. \n\nThe proton intensity used to operate this target was set to be low (8x1012 protons \n\nper pulse). Studies with higher proton intensities can be done in order to study its influence \n\non the release properties and on the degradation of the target material. \n\nThe method to obtain diffusion and effusion times from an online release curve, \n\nshow be further explored in the future, in order to better study effusion and diffusion \n\nphenomena in target materials at ISOLDE. \n\nFurther improvements can be done in the target container design and in the oven to \n\nreduce the existent temperature gradient and avoid the creation of different microstructures \n\nalong the material container. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nChapter IV - Conclusions  \n\n91 \n\n \n\nThe material study done on CaO clearly showed that better and stable isotope \n\nyields could be obtained, by knowing better how to produce, operate and handle the \n\nnanostructured material. Similar studies can be done for other oxide materials used at \n\nISOLDE, certainly gaining in the release properties. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nEffect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes \n \n\n93 \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n1.
