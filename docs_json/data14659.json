As preocupa\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais \n\nrelacionadas com as elevadas emiss\u00f5es de CO2 geradas durante a produ\u00e7\u00e3o do CPN motivaram \n\ninvestiga\u00e7\u00f5es para o desenvolvimento de novos materiais ligantes eco-eficientes. Os \n\ngeopol\u00edmeros s\u00e3o ligantes alternativos ao CPN obtidos a partir de aluminosilicatos e activadores \n\nalcalinos. A geopol\u00edmeriza\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 um processo quimico complexo que envolve a dissolu\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\naluminosilicatos, o seu transporte, orienta\u00e7\u00e3o e policondensa\u00e7\u00e3o de produtos de rea\u00e7\u00e3o. Contudo \n\ns\u00e3o reconhecidas algumas limita\u00e7\u00f5es aos geopol\u00edmeros correntes, bicomponentes (contendo \n\nsolu\u00e7\u00f5es alcalinas e silicatos sol\u00faveis). A utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de solu\u00e7\u00f5es alcalinas agressivas dificulta a \n\naplica\u00e7\u00e3o dos geopol\u00edmeros. A utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de silicato de s\u00f3dio \u00e9 respons\u00e1vel por uma elevada \n\npegada carb\u00f3nica dos geopol\u00edmeros. A durabilidade destes materiais \u00e9 ainda tema controverso. \n\nPor exemplo os geopol\u00edmeros correntes (bicomponentes) est\u00e3o associados \u00e0 forma\u00e7\u00e3o substancial \n\nde efloresc\u00eancias pelo facto das solu\u00e7\u00f5es alcalinas e silicatos sol\u00faveis n\u00e3o reagirem totalmente \n\ndurante o processo de geopolimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o. Este fen\u00f3meno \u00e9 respons\u00e1vel por um aumento da \n\npermeabilidade dos geopol\u00edmeros e por uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o da sua durabilidade. Consequentemente \u00e9 \n\nnecess\u00e1rio estudar novas e melhores misturas geopolim\u00e9ricas. A descoberta dos geopol\u00edmeros \n\nmonof\u00e1sicos \u00e9 considerada um importante acontecimento em termos de geopol\u00edmeros de baixas \n\nemiss\u00f5es de carbono aos quais basta juntar \u00e1gua, exactamente como sucede com o CPN. Contudo \n\nat\u00e9 ao presente momento estes novos ligantes tem estado associados a baixos valores de \n\nresist\u00eancia \u00e0 compress\u00e3o. Alguns autores at\u00e9 referem uma perda de resist\u00eancia ao longo do tempo \n\nem geopol\u00edmeros monof\u00e1sicos \u00e0 base de lamas vermelhas calcinadas e hidr\u00f3xido de s\u00f3dio. A \n\npresente tese pretende desenvolver novas misturas de geopol\u00edmeros monof\u00e1sicos com um \n\ndesempenho suficiente para poderem ser utilizadas pela ind\u00fastria da constru\u00e7\u00e3o. Na mesma foram \n\nestudadas as propriedades mec\u00e2nicas e a durabilidade das novas misturas. Analisou-se a \n\naplicabilidade de um modelo num\u00e9rico para a previs\u00e3o da resist\u00eancia \u00e0 compress\u00e3o das novas \n\nmisturas. Efetuou-se a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o dos produtos de rea\u00e7\u00e3o atrav\u00e9s da an\u00e1lise da microestrutura \n\ne da espectroscopia de infravermelhos. Estudou-se a possibilidade da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos geopol\u00edmeros \n\nmonof\u00e1sicos na produ\u00e7\u00e3o de argamassas porosas leves com condutibilidade t\u00e9rmica melhorada. \n\nO seu desempenho foi comparado com o desempenho de argamassas porosas leves obtidas de \n\ngeopol\u00edmeros correntes (bicomponentes) em termos de propriedades, custo e potencial de \n\naquecimento global. \n\n \n\n\n\nThesis chapters \n\n \n\nV \n \n\nAbstract \n\nThe production of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) as the essential constituent of concrete \n\nrequires considerable energy, releasing a significant amount of carbon dioxide and other \n\ngreenhouse gases (GHGs) into atmosphere. Environmental concerns regarding the high \n\nCO2 emissions related to the production of OPC led to research efforts on the development \n\nof eco-efficient alternative binders. Geopolymers constitute promising inorganic binders \n\nalternative to OPC which are based on aluminosilicates by-products and alkali activators. The \n\ngeopolymerization is a complex chemical process evolving dissolution of raw materials, \n\ntransportation, orientation and polycondensation of the reaction products. However, there are \n\nstill many drawbacks associated with traditional two part geopolymer mixes (containing \n\nalkaline species and soluble silicates). The caustic alkaline solutions make the handling and \n\napplication of geopolymers difficult. The use of sodium silicate is responsible for a high \n\ncarbon footprint of two part geopolymers. The durability of these binders is also subject of \n\nsome controversy. For instance, current two part geopolymeric mixes can suffer from a high \n\namount of efflorescence originated by the fact that alkaline or soluble silicates that are added \n\nduring processing cannot be totally consumed during geopolymerisation. This phenomenon \n\nis responsible for an increase in geopolymer permeability and reduced durability. Therefore, \n\nthe study of new and improved geopolymer mixes is needed. The discovery of one-part \n\ngeopolymers is considered as a key event on the evolution of low carbon dioxide geopolymer \n\ntechnology in the \u201cjust add water\u201d concept as it happens with OPC. However so far they were \n\nassociated with very low compressive strength. Some authors even report a compressive \n\nstrength decrease with time for one-part geopolymers based on calcined red mud and sodium \n\nhydroxide blends. The present thesis aimed to develop one part geopolymer mixtures with \n\nacceptable performance to be of some use for the construction industry. The mechanical \n\nproperties and the durability performance of the new one-part geopolymer mixtures were \n\nstudied. A numerical model to predict the compressive strength of one part-geopolymers was \n\nsuggested. Hydration products results assessed with SEM/EDS and FTIR spectra were \n\npresented. The use of one part geopolymers for production of lightweight foam mortars with \n\nthe improved thermal performance was studied. Comparisons to foam two part geopolymer \n\nmortars were made concerning properties, cost and global warming potential assessment. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThesis chapters \n\n \n\nVI \n \n\nContents                                                                              Page \n\nCHAPTER 1-Introduction \n\n1.1 Justification                                                                                                  1 \n\n1.2 Objectives                                                                                                     2 \n\n1.3 Publications                                                                                                  3 \n\n1.3.1.

Introduction  \n\nThis section presents a brief introduction and justifications on foam one-part geopolymer \n\nmortars. Then, the main objectives and finally published papers in this thesis are discussed.  \n\n  \n\n  1.1 Justifications \n\nThe increasing worldwide demand for energy is a major cause of unsustainable development \n\non our Planet. Between 2007 and 2030, energy demand will have risen around 40%, reaching \n\na total of 16.8 billion tonnes of equivalent petroleum-TEP (Pacheco-Torgal &amp; Jalali, 2011). \n\nThe rise in energy consumption has two main causes, the increase in world population and the \n\nfact that there are an increasing number of people with access to electricity. In fact, currently, \n\nthere are 1.5 billion people that still have no access to electricity (UN, 2010). Besides, since \n\nthe urban human population will almost double, increasing from approximately 3.4 billion in \n\n2009 to 6.4 billion in 2050 (WHO, 2014), this will dramatically increase electricity demand. \n\nSince buildings consume throughout their life cycle, more than 40% of all energy produced \n\n(OECD, 2003), this subsector has a high potential for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The \n\nEuropean Union has been producing legislation in the field of building\u2019s energy performance, \n\nwhich was materialised in the form of the European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive \n\n2002/91/EC (EPBD), which in turn, has been recast in the form of the 2010/ 31/ EU by the \n\nEuropean Parliament on 19 May 2010. One of the new aspects of the EPBD that reflects an \n\nambitious agenda on the reduction of the energy consumption is the introduction of the concept \n\nof nearly zero-energy building (Pacheco-Torgal, Cabeza, Mistretta, Kaklauskas, &amp; Granqvist, \n\n2013). The use of thermal insulation materials constitutes the most effective way of mitigating \n\nheat loss in buildings, thus reducing heat energy needs, and therefore contributing to the nearly \n\nzero energy target. These materials are very important for the building material industry and \n\nrepresent a 21 billion \u20ac market share (Pacheco-Torgal, 2014). However, most current insulation \n\nmaterials are associated with negative impacts in terms of toxicity. Polystyrene, for example \n\ncontains anti-oxidant additives and ignition retardants, additionally, its production involves the \n\ngeneration of benzene and chlorofluorocarbons. On the other hand, polyurethane is obtained \n\nfrom isocyanates, which are widely known for their tragic association with the Bhopal disaster. \n\nBesides, they release toxic fumes when subjected to fire (PachecoTorgal, Jalali, &amp; Fucic, \n\n2012). In terms of legislation, the European Union recently approved the Regulation (EU) \n\n305/2011 (2011) related to the Construction Products. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1-Introduction \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\nRegulation that will replace the current Directive 89/106/CEE, already amended by Directive \n\n1993/68/EEC, known as the Construction Products Directive. In the last years, several papers \n\nwere published on foam alkali-activated cements with enhanced thermal conductivity (Feng et \n\nal., 2015; Hlav\u00e1?ek, \u0160milauer, \u0160kv\u00e1ra, Kopeck\u00fd, &amp; \u0160ulc, 2015; Sanjayan, Nazari, Chen, &amp; \n\nNguyen, 2015; Zhang, Provis, Reid, &amp; Wang, 2014). However, cost analysis was oddly \n\navoided. Those authors strangely mentioned that low-cost alkali-activated cements materials \n\ncould be produced.  \n\nThe discovery of one-part alkali-activated cements is considered a key event on the evolution \n\nof low-carbon alkali-activated cements technology in the \u201cjust add water\u201d concept. Contrary to \n\nordinary Portland cement (OPC)-based materials, alkali-activated cements use caustic \n\nactivators that makes the handling and application of alkali-activated cements very difficult. \n\nThat is why the alkali-activated cements based on the OPC concept of just add water to a \n\npowder are an important research line. However, investigations made so far on one-part alkali-\n\nactivated cements show that these materials are associated with very low compressive strength \n\n(Kolou\u0161ek et al., 2007; Peng, Wan, Shen, &amp; Xiao, 2014). Some authors even report a \n\ncompressive strength decrease with time for one-part alkali-activated cements based on \n\ncalcined red mud and sodium hydroxide blends (Ke, Bernal, Ye, Provis, &amp; Yang, 2015). Since \n\nsupply chain risks can limit the alkali-activated cements technology\u2019s wider adoption, (Van \n\nDeventer, Provis, &amp; Duxson, 2012) the use of minor volumes of OPC can help overcome this \n\nproblem. Yang and Lee (2013) and Yang, Lee, Song, and Gong (2014) studied foam-ground \n\ngranulated blast-furnace slag concrete produced with three alkali activators: Ca(OH)2 plus \n\nMg(NO3)2, Ca(OH)2 plus 6.5% Na2SiO3, and 2.5% Ca(OH)2 plus Na2SiO3. These authors \n\nconcluded that a unit binder content of approximately 400 kg/m3 is required to achieve the \n\nminimum quality requirements specified by the Korean Industrial Standard for floor heating \n\nsystems. \n\n \n\n 1.2 Objectives \n\n Developing a new composition of geopolymer to produce a mortar with higher level of \n\nefficiency and sustainability, is the main objective of this study. This aim can be decomposed \n\ninto the following specific objectives: \n\n1. Developing mix composition of one-part geopolymers; \n\n2. Obtaining mechanical properties of one-part geopolymer; \n\n3. Microstructure study on the hydration products of one-part geopolymers; \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1-Introduction \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n4. Development of an analytical model to predict the compressive strength of one-part \n\ngeopolymers; \n\n5. Assessment of durability performance of one-part geopolymers; \n\n6. Development of mix compositions related to one-part foam geopolymers; \n\n7. Study the cost-efficiency performance of foam one-part geopolymers; \n\n8.

The \n\nGerman cement chemist and engineer Kuhl made the first experiences on this field in \n\n1908 (Provis and Deventer, 2014). The bibliographic history of some important alkali-activated \n\ncement/geopolymer related events is presented in Table 2.1 although this table does not mention \n\nthe contribution of Kuhl works. \n\n \n\nAlkali activated concrete have been receiving increased attention, due to the need of reducing \n\ngreenhouse gas emissions generated by Portland cement and to the need of new binders with \n\nenhanced durability performance (Duxon et al., 2007; Pacheco-Torgal et al., 2008b). \n\n \n\nResearch works carried out so far in the development of alkali-activated cements showed that \n\nmuch has already been  investigated and also that an  environmental friendly alternative to Portland \n\ncement is rising (Pacheco-Torgal et. al., 2008c; Li et. al., 2010; Davidovits et al., 1990).  \n\n \n\n \n\nDavidovits et al. (1990) was the first author to address the carbon dioxide emissions of these \n\nbinders stating that they generate just 0.184 tons of CO2 per ton of binder. Duxson et al. (2009) do \n\nnot confirm these numbers; they stated that although the CO2 emissions generated during the \n\nproduction of Na2O are very high, still the production of alkali-activated binders is associated to a \n\nlevel of carbon dioxide emissions lower than the emissions generated in the production of OPC. \n\nAccording to those authors, the reductions can go from 50% to 100%. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2-Literature review \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\nTable 2.1 Bibliographic history of some important alkali-activated cement/geopolymer related events (Li et \n\nal., 2010). \n\nAuthor Year Event \nFeret 1939 Slags used for cement. \n\nPurdon 1940 Alkali\u2013slag combinations. \n\nGlukhovsky 1959 Theoretical basis and development of alkaline cements. \n\nGlukhovsky 1965 First called \u201calkaline cements\u201d. \n\nDavidovits 1979 \u201cGeopolymer\u201d term. \n\nMalinowski 1979 Ancient aqueducts characterized. \n\nForss 1983 F-cement (slag\u2013alkali\u2013superplasticizer). \n\nLangton and Roy 1984 Ancient building materials characterized. \n\nDavidovits and Sawyer 1985 Patent of \u201cPyrament\u201d cement. \n\nKrivenko 1986 DSc thesis, R2O\u2013RO\u2013SiO2\u2013H2O. \n\nMalolepsy and Petri 1986 Activation of synthetic melilite slags. \n\nMalek et al. 1986 Slag cement-low level radioactive wastes forms. \n\nDavidovits 1987 Ancient and modern concretes compared. \n\nDeja and Malolepsy 1989 Resistance to chlorides shown. \n\nKaushal et al. 1989 Adiabatic cured nuclear wastes forms from alkaline mixtures. \n\nRoy and Langton 1989 Ancient concretes analogs. \n\nMajundar et al. 1989 C12A7\u2013slag activation. \n\nTalling and Brandstetr 1989 Alkali-activated slag. \n\nWu et al. 1990 Activation of slag cement. \n\nRoy et al. 1991 Rapid setting alkali-activated cements. \n\nRoy and Silsbee 1992 Alkali-activated cements: an overview. \n\nPalomo and Glasser 1992 CBC with metakaolin. \n\nRoy and Malek 1993 Slag cement. \n\nGlukhovsky 1994 Ancient, modern and future concretes. \n\nKrivenko 1994 Alkaline cements. \n\nWang and Scivener 1995 Slag and alkali-activated microstructure. \n\nShi 1996 Strength, pore structure and permeability of alkali-activated slag. \n\nFern\u00e1ndez-Jim\u00e9nez and Puertas 1997 Kinetic studies of alkali-activated slag cements. \n\nKatz 1998 Microstructure of alkali-activated fly ash. \n\nDavidovits 1999 Chemistry of geopolymeric systems, technology. \n\nRoy 1999 Opportunities and challenges of alkali-activated cements. \n\nPalomo 1999 Alkali-activated fly ash \u2014 a cement for the future. \n\nGong and Yang 2000 Alkali-activated red mud\u2013slag cement. \n\nPuertas 2000 Alkali-activated fly ash/slag cement. \n\nBakharev 2001\u20132002 Alkali-activated slag concrete. \n\nPalomo and Palacios 2003 Immobilization of hazardous wastes. \n\nGrutzeck 2004 Zeolite formation. \n\nSun 2006 Sialite technology. \n\nDuxson 2007 Geopolymer technology: the current state of the art. \n\nHajimohammadi, Provis and Deventer 2008 One-part geopolymer. \n\nProvis and Deventer \n2009 Geopolymers: structure, processing, properties and industrial \n\napplications. \nNote: According to Pacheco-Torgal (2014) this table should have credited the \u201cone-part geopolymer\u201d concept \n\nto Kolousek et al (2007) because their paper was submitted to review process in March 19 of 2007 and published \n\nonline in 27 of July of 2007 while the paper of Hajimohammadi et al. (mentioned in the table) was submitted to review \n\nprocess on April 28 of 2008 and accepted by September 23 and published only by October 29 of 2008. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2-Literature review \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\nDuxson and Van Deventer (2009) mention an independent study made by Zeobond Pty. Ltd. in \n\nwhich a low emissions Portland cement (0.67 ton/ton) and alkali-activated binders were compared, \n\nreporting that the latter had 80% lower CO2 emissions. Weil et al. (2009) mentioned that the \n\nsodium hydroxide and the sodium silicate are responsible for the majority of CO2 emissions in \n\nalkali-activated binders. These authors compared Portland cement concrete and alkali-activated \n\nconcrete with similar durability reporting that the latter have 70% lower CO2 emissions, which \n\nconfirmed the aforementioned reductions. McLellan et al. (2011) reported 44% to 64% reduction \n\nin greenhouse gas emissions of alkali-activated binders when compared to OPC.  \n\n \n\nHabert et al. (2011) carried out a detailed environmental evaluation of alkali activated binders \n\nusing the Life Cycle Assessment methodology confirming that they have a lower impact on global \n\nwarming than OPC, but on the other side they have a higher environmental impact regarding other \n\ncategories. More recently Turner and Collins (2013) showed that the CO2 footprint of a 40 MPa \n\ngeopolymer concrete was approximately just 9% less than comparable concrete containing 100% \n\nOPC binder (328 kg/m3). Being that the major part was due to sodium silicate (Fig. 2.1). \n\n \n\nThe high cost of alkali-activated binders is one of the major factors, which remain a severe \n\ndisadvantage over Portland cement (Habert et al., 2011). Therefore, investigations about the \n\nreplacement of water glass by sodic wastes are needed (Laldji et al., 2007). Currently alkali-\n\nactivated binders only becomes economic competitive for high performance structural purposes, \n\nbecause the cost of alkali-activated concretes is located midway between OPC concretes and high \n\nperformance concretes. Since the average concrete class production lies between C25/30 and \n\nC30/37 and only 11% of the ready-mixed concrete production is above the strength class C35/45 \n\n(ERMCO, 2011), this means that alkali-activated binders are targeting a small market share. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2-Literature review \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n \n\nFig 2.1. Summary of CO2-emission for Grade 40 concrete mixtures with OPC and geopolymer \n\nbinders (Turner and Collins, 2013) \n\nTherefore, in the short term the above cited disadvantage means that the study of alkali-activated \n\napplications should focus on high cost materials such as, commercial concrete repair mortars. \n\nPacheco-Torgal (2008a and 2009) showed that alkali-activated mortars could be as much as 7 \n\ntimes cheaper than current commercial repair mortars thus pointing available alternative for alkali-\n\nactivated binders. These materials are still at the beginning stages of development and hence need \n\nfurther research work in order to become technically and economically viable construction \n\nmaterials.  \n\n \n\nAlkali activated materials is the broadest classification encompassing any binder derived by the \n\nreaction of an alkali metal source with a solid silicate powder while geopolymers is a subset of \n\nalkali activated materials where the binding phase is almost exclusively aluminosilicate and highly \n\ncoordinated (Provis and Deventer, 2014). \n\n \n\nResearch in this field has been published as \u2018\u2018alkali-activated\u2019\u2019 binders, the term \u2018\u2018geopolymer\u2019\u2019 \n\nis the generally accepted name for this technology. Investigations in the field of geopolymers had \n\nan exponential increase after the research results of Davidovits who developed and patented \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2-Literature review \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\nbinders obtained from the alkali-activation of metakaolin, having named it with the term \n\n\u201cgeopolymer\u201d in 1978. For the chemical designation of the geopolymer. Davidovits suggests the \n\nname \u201cpolysialates\u201d, in which sialate is an abbreviation for aluminosilicate oxide. The sialate \n\nnetwork is composed of tetrahedral anions [SiO4]\n4- and [AlO4]\n\n5- sharing the oxygen, which need \n\npositive ions such as (Na+, K\n+\n\n, Li\n+\n\n, Ca\n++\n\n, Na\n+\n\n, Ba\n++\n\n, NH4\n+\n\n, H3O\n+) to compensate the electric charge \n\nof Al 3+ in tetrahedral coordination (after dehydroxilation the aluminum changes from coordination \n\n6 (octahedral) to coordination 4 (tetrahedral).  \n\n \n\nThe polysialate has the following empiric formulae: \n\n \n\nMn{-( SiO2)z- AlO2}n, w H2O \n\n \n\nin which: n is the degree of polymerization, z is 1, 2 or 3, and M is an alkalication, such as \n\npotassium or sodium, generating different types of poly(sialates). According to Davidovits, \n\ngeopolymers are polymers because they transform, polymerize and harden at low temperature.  \n\n \n\nBut they are also geopolymers, because they are inorganic, hard and stable at high temperature and \n\nalso non inflammable. Over the last years several authors have reported research in a large number \n\nof aspects related to geopolymers such as:  dependence of the nature of source materials (alkali-\n\nactivated binders synthesized from calcined sources show a higher compressive strength than from \n\nraw materials) (Provis, 2009; Bakharev, 2005), immobilization of toxic metals  (Barbosa et al., \n\n2000; Vance et al., 2009; Vinsova et al., 2007), reaction mechanisms and hydration products \n\n(Provis et al., 2009; Bakharev, 2005; MacKenzi et al., 2005; Fernandez-Jimenez et al., 2005b), the \n\nrole of calcium in geopolymerization (Weng et al., 2005; Yip et al., 2003; Yip et al., 2005) the \n\ndevelopment of lightweight building materials (Buchwald et al., 2005), durability issues (Hwai-\n\nChung and Peijang, 2005; Provis et al., 2008; Kani et al., 2011) and even LCA (Weil et al., 2009; \n\nHabert et al., 2011). \n\n \n\nAccording to those authors (Glukhovsky, 1981), an increase in the compressive strength of 4 MPa \n\nwould require 24 h hydrothermal treatment at 100 \u00baC. The use of a much more intensive treatment \n\n(140 \u00baC) would increase compressive strength of 12-20 MPa. Some authors recently investigated \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2-Literature review \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\nthese materials having reported a 28 days curing compressive strength of 27 MPa by using fly ash \n\nand 30% OPC (Abdollahnejad et al., 2014). \n\n \n\nSo far investigations related to the geopolymerization of concentration and determination work are \n\nscarce (Lampris et al., 2009; Allahverdi and Najafi Kani, 2009), nevertheless, it seems that this \n\nbinder has potential features to reuse recycled aggregates for the production of HPC. For the same \n\nwater/binder ratio several authors reported that geopolymers present a higher mechanical strength \n\nthan Portland cement.  \n\n \n\nWang in 1991 states a case of a geopolymeric concrete with 125 MPa compression strength. Other \n\nauthors (Davidovits, 1994a) declare having obtained a 20 MPa strength just after 4 h increasing to \n\n70\u2013100 MPa after 28 days curing. Fernandez-Jimenez et al. (2005a) studied mortars (w/b = 0.51) \n\nactivated with NaOH and waterglass reporting 100 MPa for compressive strength. Fernandez-\n\nJimenez and Palomo in 2005a used slag/fly ashes mixtures activated with NaOH and waterglass \n\n(w/b = 0.35) announcing a 90 MPa compressive strength just after 20 h. Bakharev in 2005 studied \n\nfly ash pastes activated with NaOH and waterglass (w/b = 0.3) stating a 60 MPa compressive \n\nstrength just after 2 days. Other authors (Pacheco-Torgal et al., 2007) report a compressive strength \n\nhigher than 30 MPa after only one day, reaching almost 70 MPa after 28 days curing and 90 MPa \n\nat 90 days curing. In conventional concrete, the aggregates form a rigid skeleton of granular \n\nelements, which are responsible for compressive strength, in geopolymers most of the compressive \n\nstrength is related to the matrix characteristics, therefore, this material does not rely in well-\n\nproportioned aggregate mixtures. This makes geopolymer concrete more suitable to reuse recycled \n\naggregates. \n\n \n\nThese materials have another advantage over Portland cement concrete that is particularly \n\ninteresting in the case of reusing contaminated recycled aggregates, a high immobilization \n\ncapacity. According to Hermann et al. in 1999 the use of alkali-activated binders is a good way to \n\nimmobilize a wide range of harmful constituents such as toxic metals, hydrocarbonates and even \n\nnuclear wastes in a final product with high durability and costing much less than the current \n\nvitrification process (Hermann et al., 1999). In 2007, Vinsova et al. refer that alkali-activated \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2-Literature review \n\n \n\n13 \n \n\nbinders show a good performance in the immobilization of lead, cadmium and chromium, being \n\nless effective for immobilization of arsenic.  \n\n \n\nLancellotti et al. (2010) showed that metakaolin based geopolymers binders are able to immobilize \n\ntoxic metals present in fly ash due to the incineration of municipal solid wastes. Immobilization \n\nof a municipal solid waste incineration residue using geopolymers was recently reported (Galiano, \n\net al., 2010). Other authors (Hermann et al., 1999; Vinsova et al., 2007; Lancellotti, et al., 2010; \n\nGaliano, et al., 2010; Pacheco-Togal, et al., 2010; Garcia-Lodeiro, et al., 2007; Fu, et al., 2011; \n\nZhang, et al., 2011) showed that geopolymeric binders can be used for the reuse of mine wastes. \n\nBesides geopolymeric concretes are associated to lower CO2 emissions than Portland cement \n\nconcretes (Duxson, et al., 2007; Weil, et al., 2009; Habert, et al., 2011). This is a crucial advantage \n\nbecause Portland cement represents almost 80% of the total CO2 emissions of concrete, which in \n\nturn are about 6\u20137% of the Planet\u2019s total CO2 emissions (Shi, et al., 2011; Pacheco-Torgal, et al., \n\n2012b).  \n\nWith a view to the large-scale adaptation of alkalin cement technology the world over, in 2007 a \n\nRILEM technical committee (TC 224 \u2013 AAM) began to compile and summarize experiences in \n\nconnection with prime materials, cements, concretes, structures, output, test procedures, durability, \n\nenvisaged use and so on. The ultimate aim is to develop basic recommendations for specifications \n\ndesigned to bring these cements to a market where they can compete on a level playing field with \n\nPortland cements. \n\n \n\n2.2 Limitation of durability of geopolymer \n\n   Besides the durability of alkali-activated binder is a subject of some controversy, while Duxson \n\net al. (2009) state this is the most important determining the success of these new materials and \n\nother authors mention that the fact that samples from the former Soviet Union that have been \n\nexposed to service conditions for in excess of 30 years showing little degradation means that \n\ngeopolymers do therefore appear to stand the test of time (Pacheco-Torgal F et al., 2012b).  \n\nHowever, since those materials were of the (Si + Ca) type that conclusion cannot be extended to \n\ngeopolymers defined as \u2018\u2018alkali alumino silicate gel, with aluminium and silicon linked in a \n\ntetrahedral gel framework\u2019\u2019 (Weil M et al., 2009). On the other side Juenger et al. (2011) argue \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2-Literature review \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\nthat \u2018\u2018the key unsolved question in the development and application of alkali activation technology \n\nis the issue of durability\u2019\u2019 and more recently Van Deventer et al. (2012) recognized that \u2018\u2018whether \n\ngeopolymer concretes are durable remains the major obstacle to recognition in standards for \n\nstructural concrete\u2019\u2019. \n\nGeopolymers as the alkali-actived binder have some properties which have advantages and \n\ndisadvantages. Recently the following geopolymer properties were concerned by researchers \n\nwhich include: \n\n1. Resistance to acid attack; \n\n2. Alkali-silica reaction (ASR); \n\n3. Corrosion of steel reinforcement; \n\n4. Resistance to high temperatures;  \n\n5. Efflorescence; \n\n \n\n2.2.1 Resistance to acid attack \n\nConcerning the resistance to acid attack, geopolymer performance is far better than that of \n\nPortland cement concretes because it does not contain Ca(OH)2, a soluble hydration product that \n\nconstitutes the \u2018\u2018Achilles\u2019 heel\u2019\u2019 of Portland cement concrete.  Calcium hydroxide contributes \n\nslightly to the strength and impermeability of the paste, because it reduces the total pore volume \n\nby converting some of the liquid water into solid form. In this respect it is much less important \n\nthan the C-S-H, however. CH is the most soluble of the hydration products, and thus is a weak link \n\nin cement and concrete from a durability point of view. If the paste is exposed to fresh water, the \n\nCH will leach out (dissolve), increasing the porosity and thus making the paste more vulnerable to \n\nfurther leaching and chemical attack. \n\n \n\n   Davidovits et al. (1990) reported mass losses of 6% and 7% for geopolymeric binders immersed \n\nin 5% concentration hydrochloric and sulfuric acids during 4 weeks. For the same conditions he \n\nalso observed that Portland cement based concretes suffered mass losses between 78% and 95%. \n\nOther authors (Gourley and Johnson, 2005) mentioned that a Portland cement concrete with a \n\nservice life of 50 years lost 25% of its mass after 80 immersions cycles in a sulfuric acid solution \n\n(pH = 1) while a geopolymeric concrete required 1400 immersions cycles to lose the same mass, \n\nthus meaning a service life of 900 years.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2-Literature review \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n \n\nMore recently Pacheco-Torgal et al. (2010) mentioned an average mass loss of just 2.6% after \n\nbeing submitted to the attack of (sulfuric, hydrochloric and nitric) acids during 28 days, while the \n\nmass loss for Portland cement concretes is more than twice that value.  \n\n \n\n \n\n   Several authors reported that chemical resistance is one of the major advantages of alkali-\n\nactivated binders over Portland cement. In 1981,  Glukhovsky used alkali-activated slag mortars \n\nnoticing that they showed increase tensile strength even after being immersed in lactic and \n\nhydrochloric acid solutions (pH = 3). Jiang (1997) studied the exposure of alkali- activated slag \n\nmortars during six months in 5% acid solution concentration, reporting that for citric acid changes \n\nwere low, for nitric and hydrochloric acid changes were moderate although severe changes was \n\nnoticed when sulphuric acid was used.  \n\n \n\nDavidovits et al. (1990) reported mass losses of 6% and 7% for alkali-activated binders immersed \n\nin 5% concentration hydrochloric and sulphuric acids during 4 weeks. For the same conditions, he \n\nalso reported that Portland cement based concretes suffered mass losses between 78% and 95% \n\n(1999 a),  Palomo et al. studied metakaolin mixtures activated with NaOH and water- glass when \n\nsubmitted to  sulphuric acid (pH = 3), sea water ported a minor flexural strength  decrease from 7 \n\nto 28 days immersion, between 28 and 56 days flexural strength rises, decreasing again from 56 to \n\n90 days and rising from that day forward. They reported that the behavior was similar to the several \n\nacid solutions. According to these authors, unreacted sodium particles are not in the structure of \n\nthe hardened material, remaining in a soluble condition thus when in contact with a solution they \n\nare leached increasing the binder porosity and lowering mechanical strength. On the other hand, \n\nstrength increase after 3 months indicates that the reaction process is still evolving, with the \n\nformation of zeolitic precipitates thus lowering porosity and increasing strength.  \n\n \n\nShi and Stegmann (2000) compared the acid resistance of several binders; alkali-activated slags \n\n(AASs), OPC binders, fly ash/lime binders (FAL) and high alumina cement (AC), when immersed \n\nin nitric (pH = 3) and acetic (pH = 3 and 5) acid solutions. They reported that OPC binders \n\npresented higher mass losses than AAS and FAL binders while AC pastes were completely \n\ndissolved. According to these authors, OPC pastes are more porous than AAS but less porous than \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2-Literature review \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\nFAL pastes, so chemical attack is more influenced by the nature of hydration products than from \n\nporosity. They also reported that low pH acids are responsible for the highest chemical attack.  \n\n \n\nBakharev et al. (2002) also compared OPC and alkali-activated slag concrete resistance to sulphat \n\nattack, reporting that the former showed a lower strength reduction, that could be explained due to \n\nthe binder structure chemical differences. Bakharev et al. (2002) studied OPC and slag concretes \n\nactivated with NaOH and water glass, immersed in an acetic acid solution (pH = 4) during one \n\nyear. They reported a 33% strength loss for the former and 47% for OPC concretes.  \n\n \n\n   They claim that the strength loss is influenced by Ca content, 64% for OPC concretes and just \n\n39% for alkali-activated slag concretes. Besides slag compounds have lower Ca/Si molar ratio and \n\nare more stable in acid medium. As for OPC concrete calcium compounds, possess high Ca/Si \n\nmolar ratios and react with acetic acid forming acetic calcium compounds which is very soluble.  \n\n \n\n2.2.2 Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) \n\nThe chance of ASR may take place in alkali-activated binders is an unknown subject. For OPC \n\nbinders, however, the knowledge of ASR has been intensively studied; therefore, some \n\nexplanations could be also applied to understand the possibility of ASR when alkali-activated \n\nbinders are used. ASR was reported by the first time by Stanton (1940) and needs the simultaneous \n\naction of three elements in order to occur: (a) enough amorphous silica, (b) alkal ions and (c) water \n\n(Sims and Brown, 1998).  \n\n \n\nThe ASR begins when the reactive silica from the aggregates is attacked by the alkaline ions \n\nfrom cement forming an alkali\u2013silica gel, which attracts water and starts to expand. The gel \n\nexpansion leads to internal cracking, what have been confirmed by others (Wood and Johnson, \n\n1993) reporting 4 MPa pressures. Those internal tensions are higher than OPC concrete tensile \n\nstrength, thus leading to cracking. However, some authors believe that ASR is not just a reaction \n\nbetween alkaline ions and amorphous silica but also requires the presence of Ca2+ ions (Davies, \n\n1998). In 1991, Davidovits compared alkali-activated binders and OPC binders when submitted to \n\nthe ASTM C227 mortar-bar test, reporting a shrinkage behavior in the first case and a serious \n\nexpansion for the OPC binder. Other authors (Fernandez-Jimenez and Puertas, 2002) reported \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2-Literature review \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\nsome expansion behavior for alkali-activated binders although smaller than for OPC binders. \n\nHowever, Puertas (1995) believe ASR could occur for alkali-activated slag binders containing \n\nreactive opala aggregates. Bakharev et al. (2001) compared the expansion of OPC and alkali-\n\nactivated binders reporting that the first ones had higher expansion. This is clear from the \n\nmicrostructure analysis (Fig. 2.2).  \n\n \n\n  Fig 2.2. Alkali-activated concrete after 10 months curing. (A)  \n\n  Reactive aggregate. (G) Alkali-silica gel (Puertas F et al., 2009). \n\n \n\n   Garc\u00eda-Lodeiro et al. (2007) showed that alkali-activated fly ash is less susceptible to generate \n\nexpansion by alkali\u2013silica reaction than OPC. They also showed that the calcium plays an essential \n\nrole in the expansive nature of the gels. Recent investigations (Puertas et al., 2009) show that \n\nsiliceous aggregates are more prone to ASR than calcareous aggregates in alkali-activated \n\nmixtures. Cyr and Pouhet (2014) reviewed the work of several authors concerning the expansion \n\ndue to ASR (Fig. 2.3) noticing that some mixtures show an expansion above the limit proposed in \n\nthe standard used for ASR tests. Therefore the study of ASR, in alkali-activated binders is not a \n\nclosed subject, at least for the geopolymer mixtures containing calcium. \n\n \n\n2.2.3 Corrosion of steel reinforcement \n\nThe corrosion of steel reinforcement is one of the causes that influences the structural capability \n\nof concrete elements. As concrete attack depends on its high volume and therefore is not of great \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2-Literature review \n\n \n\n18 \n \n\nconcern, an attack to the steel reinforced bars is a serious threat eased by the fact that steel bars are \n\nvery near of concrete surface and are very corrosion sensitive. In OPC binders, steel bars are \n\nprotected by a passive layer, due to the high alkalinity of calcium hydroxide. The steel bars \n\ncorrosion may happen if pH decreases thus destroying the passive layer, due to carbonation \n\nphenomenon or chloride ingress. The steel corrosion occurs due to an electrochemical action, when \n\nmetals of different nature are in electrical contact in the presence of water and oxygen. The process \n\nconsists in the anodic dissolution of iron when the positively charged iron ions pass into the \n\nsolution and the excess of negatively charged electrons goes to steel through the cathode, where \n\nthey are absorbed by the electrolyte constituents to form hydroxyl ions. These in turn combine \n\nwith the iron ions to form ferric hydroxide, which then converts to rust. The volume increase \n\nassociated with the formation of the corrosion products will lead to cracking and spalling of the \n\nconcrete cover.  \n\n \n\nFor alkali-activated binders the literature is small about its capability to prevent reinforced steel \n\ncorrosion. Torgal et.al investigated on the chloride diffusion, which clearly showed  alkali-\n\nactivated binders are able to prevent the ingress of harmful elements that could start steel corrosion.  \n\n \n\nRoy et al. (2000) compared chloride diffusion for OPC and alkali-activated binders reporting that \n\nthe former presented almost half of the diffusion values of the OPC binders. Saraswathy et al. \n\n(2003) studied alkali-activated fly ash mixtures reporting a steel corrosion resistance similar to the \n\none of OPC binders.  \n\n \n\nMiranda et al. (2005) even demonstrated that alkali-activated fly ash binders have superior pH \n\nconditions than OPC binders. They reported that pH decreased with hydration reaction \n\ndevelopment, however an alkaline condition remained even after 5 years, since carbonation \n\nphenomenon did not take place.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2-Literature review \n\n \n\n19 \n \n\n \n \n\n \n Reference Temperature Age of \n\ntest \n\nExplanation of the different AAS \n\nmixtures \n\nA1, A2 Bakharev et al.

(2009) mention that alkali-activated slag concrete is associated to poor \n\ncarbonation resistance a major cause for corrosion of steel reinforcement. Bernal et al. (2010) \n\nshows that the activation of granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS)\u2013metakaolin (MK) blends have \n\nlow carbonation resistance. The same authors (Bernal et al., 2010) found that alkali-activated slag \n\nconcretes present some susceptibility to carbonation, which depends on the binder content (Fig. \n\n2.4).  \n\n \n\nFig 2.4. Transverse sections of carbonated alkali-activated slag concretes after 1000 h of exposure to \n\na 1% CO2 environment, with the extent of carbonation revealed by a phenolphthalein indicator. \n\nSamples are 76.2 mm in diameter (Bernal et al., 2010). \n\n \n\nLloyd et al. (2010) show that geopolymer cement is prone to alkali leaching. This leads to a \n\nreduction in the pH and could cause steel corrosion. \n\nThey also mention that the presence of calcium is crucial for having \u2018\u2018durable steel-reinforced \n\nconcrete\u2019\u2019 which is a setback for Si\u2013Al geopolymers. Further research about reinforced steel \n\ncorrosion is therefore needed, concerning alkalinity stability with curing time, as well as about \n\nchloride diffusion and carbonation resistance. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2.4 Resistance to high temperatures and to fire \n\nConcretes based on Portland cement show a weak performance when subjected to a thermal \n\ntreatment and when the temperature rises above 300 \u00baC they begin to disintegrate. As the alkali-\n\nactivated binders show a high stability when submitted to high temperatures even around 1000 \u00baC \n\n(Pawlasova et al., 2007). Other authors (Bortnovsky et al., 2007) studied the activation of \n\nmetakaolin and shale wastes reporting a high mechanical performance after a thermal phase. The \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2-Literature review \n\n \n\n21 \n \n\nspecimens show some slight strength loss between 600 \u00baC and 1000 \u00baC, however in some cases \n\nthey show a strength increase at 1200 \u00baC. Kong et al. (2008) studied alkali-activated metakaolin \n\nbinders observing that the residual strength after a thermal phase up to 800 \u00baC is influenced by the \n\nSi/Al ratio. The higher residual strength was obtained by the mixtures with a Si/Al ratio between \n\n1.5 and 1.7.  \n\n \n\nKrivenko and Guziy (2007) found that alkali-activated binders show a high performance in the \n\nresistance to fire, thus suggesting that this material is suitable for use in works with a high fire risk \n\nlike tunnels and tall buildings. Pern\u00e1 et al. (2007) confirmed that alkali-activated binders can be \n\nused as a 120 min anti-fire material in accordance with related standards of the Czech Republic. \n\nThe anti-fire material must show a temperature lower than 120 \u00baC in the opposite side of the fire \n\naction.  \n\n \n\nTemuujin et al. (2011) used alkali- activated binders as steel coatings stating that they maintained \n\nhigh structural integrity even after being submitted to a heat treatment by a gas torch. Zhao and \n\nSanjayan (2011) compared the performance of OPC concrete and alkali activated concrete under \n\nthe standard curve fire test mentioning that only the former exhibit spalling behavior. The internal \n\npore structure of the latter allows a quick escape of the water vapor resulting in lower internal pore \n\npressure. \n\n \n\n2.2.5 Efflorescences \n\n   Very few authors have investigated this serious limitation of geopolymers. Davidovits never \n\nmentioned and a search on the website of Geopolymer Institute show no paper about \n\nefflorescences. Also a search on Scopus about the words \u201cgeopolymers\u201d and \u201cefflorescences\u201d \n\nshow that only in 2007 was published the first paper where this problem is mentioned. \n\nNevertheless, geopolymers suffer from severe efflorescence (Pacheco-Torgal and Jalali, 2010) \n\nbecause the bond between the sodium ions (Na+) and the aluminosilicate structure is weak which \n\nexplains the leaching behavior (Skvara et al., 2008). According to those authors it is the presence \n\nof water that weakens the bond of sodium in the aluminosilicate polymers, a behavior that is \n\nconfirmed by the geopolymer structure model (Fig. 2.5). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2-Literature review \n\n \n\n22 \n \n\n \n\nFig 2.5. Geopolymer structure model (Skvara et al., 2008). \n\n \n\nThe subject of efflorescences in alkali-activated binders is relatively new, since very few authors \n\nhave addressed this problem.  \n\nPacheco-Torgal and Jalali (2010) also found that sodium efflorecences are higher in alkali-\n\nactivated binders based aluminosilicate prime materials calcined at a temperature range below the \n\ndehydroxylation temperature with the addition of sodium carbonate as a source of sodium cations \n\n(Fig. 2.6). \n\n \n\nTemuujin et al. (2009) refer that although ambient cured fly ash alkali-activated binders exhibited \n\nefflorescences and that phenomena do not occur when the same alkali-activated binders are cured \n\nat elevated temperature which means the leach ate of sodium could be a sign of insufficient \n\ngeopolymerisation. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2-Literature review \n\n \n\n23 \n \n\n \n\nFig 2.6. Alkali-activated mine waste mortars specimens after water immersion: Above mortars based \n\non plain mine waste mud calcined at 950 \u00baC for 2 h; Below mortars based on mine waste  mud \n\ncalcined at different temperatures with sodium carbonate (Pacheco-Torgal and Jalali, 2010) \n\n \n\nVan Deventer et al. (2010) recognized that current two part geopolymers suffer from severe \n\nefflorescence which is originated by the fact that \u2018\u2018alkaline and/or soluble silicates that are added \n\nduring processing cannot be totally consumed during geopolymerisation\u2019\u2019. Kani et al. (2011) \n\nshowed that efflorescences can be reduced either by the addition of alumina-rich admixtures or by \n\nhydrothermal curing at temperatures of 65\u00b0C or higher. These authors found that the use of 8% of \n\ncalcium aluminate cement greatly reduces the mobility of alkalis leading to minimum \n\nefflorescences (this cement has 28% of CaO). \n\n \n\nRecently Skvara et al. (2012) showed that Na, K is bounded only weakly in the nanostructure of \n\nthe geopolymer (N, K)\u2013A\u2013S\u2013H gel and is therefore leachable almost completely. This confirms \n\nthat efflorescences is a worrying limitation of two part geopolymers when exposed to water or \n\nenvironments with RH above 30% (Fig. 2.7).  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2-Literature review \n\n \n\n24 \n \n\n \n\nFig 2.7. High efflorescence after 50 days of partially-immersed Alkali activated fly ash \n\n \n\nZhang et al. (2014) also confirmed the presence of efflorescences in fly ash based geopolymers \n\n(Fig.2.8). Those authors recommended the use of hydrothermal treatments of geopolymers in order \n\nto reduce efflorescences formation. However this not only increases the cost of geopolymers but \n\nalso increases its carbon dioxide footprint.  \n\nThere are many drawbacks associated with traditional two part mixes for the synthesis of \n\ngeopolymers. The caustic alkaline solutions needed to form the geopolymers make the handling \n\nand application of geopolymers difficult. In addition, workability is generally poor and not easily \n\nadjustable due to a sticky and thick mortar that is generated during processing. The system is also \n\nsensitive to the ratio of alkaline and soluble silicate, which is difficult to control in practice.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2-Literature review \n\n \n\n25 \n \n\n \n\nFig 2.8. Efflorescence of the dense geopolymer TRSF0 and the foamed geopolymer TRSF2 \n\nspecimens stored for times with the bottom in contact with water (Zhang et al., 2014) \n\n \n\nAdditionally, using hydrothermal curing has serious limitations for on-site concrete placement \n\noperations. Most importantly, the alkaline soluble silicate that are added during processing cannot \n\nbe totally consumed during geopolymerisation, even with curing at a raised temperature, due to \n\nthe existence of dissolution equilibrium of raw aluminosilicate materials in alkaline silicate \n\nsolutions. This causes severe efflorescences of the final geopolymer products and high \n\npermeability and water absorption due to the movement of alkali together with water to the \n\ngeopolymer surfaces. This means that this subject merits further investigations.  \n\n \n\n2.3 One part geopolymers \n\nOne-part geopolymers represent a key event on geopolymer technology having been described by \n\nthe first time in 2007 (Kolousek et al., 2007; Shi et al., 2011). The present invention provides an \n\nalternative to the conventional two part mixes and advantageously alleviates one or more of the \n\ndisadvantages of prior part. The discovery of one-part geopolymers is considered as an important \n\nphenomena in the evolution of low carbon geopolymer technology in the \u201cjust add water\u201d concept. \n\nHowever they were associated with low compressive strength (Koulosek et al., 2007). Recent \n\ninvestigations (Peng et al., 2015) confirm that one-part geopolymers show low mechanical \n\nstrength. These authors noticed that the one part geopolymer mixtures show an increased reduced \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2-Literature review \n\n \n\n26 \n \n\ncompressive strength after being immersed in water. This reduction being dependent on the kaolin \n\nthermal treatment. Higher calcination temperatures being responsible for higher compressive \n\nlosses. Other authors (Ke et al., 2015) even reported a compressive strength decrease for one-part \n\ngeopolymers based on calcined red mud and sodium hydroxide blends just after the first week of \n\ncuring (Fig. 2.9). These limitations mean that further investigations are needed concerning the \n\ndevelopment of new and improved one part geopolymers. \n\n \nFig. 2.9 Compressive strengths of red mud-based one-part geopolymers produced with different \n\nactivator doses as a function of the time of curing (Ke et al., 2015) \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4 Conclusions \n\nResearch on alkali-activated binders shows a broadest potential due to low CO2 emissions. These \n\nmaterials can be taken into account as an alternative to Portland cement, although various \n\ninvestigations need to be performed on the characteristics of these new materials. Many authors \n\nconfirmed the reduction of CO2 emission when the alkali activated binder in compared to Portland \n\ncement, which leads to lower impact on global warming than OPC. Geopolymer is a subset of \n\nalkali activated materials with mostly binding phase of aluminosilicate and highly coordinated.  \n\nNew investigations are needed on the use of sodic wastes to replace sodium silicate in order to \n\nreduce the cost of this material; The new binders present higher chemical resistance, however it \n\nseems that depends more on the low content of soluble calcium compounds than their low \n\npermeability; although these binders contain a high level of alkali elements, they do not appear to \n\nbe associated with the occurrence of ASR, which may be because the majority of alkali elements \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2-Literature review \n\n \n\n27 \n \n\nare associated with other reaction products. However, that explanation forgets the crucial role \n\nplayed by calcium in the ASR development meaning that although it is rather natural the absence \n\nof ASR in free calcium alkali-activated binders, that problem must be taken under consideration \n\nwhen calcium based binders were used. As the capability to keep an alkaline environment through \n\ntime, which is crucial to maintain reinforced steel safe from corrosion, the current studies are not \n\nenough to prove it, as a matter of fact their resistance to carbonation is lower than OPC binders \n\nand recent investigation show that it is difficult to synthesize a low-Ca geopolymer capable of \n\npreserving the steel reinforcement passivation film; the use of calcium in alkali-activated binders \n\nis indispensable to keep a high pH but at the same time could be the responsible for triggering \n\nASR; Contrary to standard OPC binders alkali-activated binders show a high stability when \n\nsubmitted to high temperatures which dependent on the Si/Al ratio. The investigations on the fire \n\nbehavior of alkali-activated binders show that these materials are specially recommended for \n\nworks with a high fire risk like tunnels and tall buildings; Alkali-activated binders are prone to the \n\nformation of efflorescences however this disadvantage can be greatly reduced when using \n\nhydrothermal curing treatments or calcium aluminate admixtures. Nevertheless, hydrothermal \n\ncuring has limited applications for on situ concrete placement operations and the use of a calcium-\n\nbased admixture raises issues about its acid resistance. Furthermore, alkali-activated binders \n\ncontaining calcium-based admixture have a higher global warming impact than alkali-activated \n\nSi-Al mixtures. There are many drawbacks associated with the application of traditional two part \n\nmixes for the synthesis of geopolymers. One-part geopolymers \u2018just add water concept\u2019 represent \n\na key event on geopolymer technology. The present invention provides an alternative to the \n\nconventional two part mixes and advantageously alleviates one or more of the disadvantages of \n\nprior part. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4-Mix design, properties and durability \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER FOUR \n\nMechanical Properties, Microstructure and Durability \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4-Mix design, properties and durability \n\n \n\n4.1 Mechanical properties \n\nAfter obtaining suitable values of materials for mortar, different specimens will be made with \n\ndifferent mixtures and the properties of the fresh and hardened mortar will be evaluated.  \n\n \n\nMechanical properties and durability of hardened mortar will be assessed according to relevant \n\nstandards such as ASTM and EN.

The results show that \n\nthe most promising mixture (8A) has a compressive strength around 27 MPa after 28 days curing.  \n\n \n\nThis mixture also has the eco-efficient advantage of containing a high content of an industrial by-\n\nproduct. The mixture 2A shows a high compressive strength performance which is due to a low \n\nw/b ratio. The results also show that the curing days increase the compressive strength.  \n\n \n\nThis is a behaviour that is not observed in two part alkali-activated cements in which the \n\ncompressive strength just after one day can reach 50% to 70% of the compressive strength after \n\n28 days curing (Pacheco-Torgal et al, 2007). However, while this behaviour is most evident for \n\nMix \nCalcined \n\nstuff**/Powder \nFly ash/ \n\nPowder \n\nOPC/Powder\n\n* \nCa(OH)2/\n\nPowder \nWater/Powder \n\nSand/ \n\nPowder \n\nSP/ \n\nOPC \n\n1-D  \n\n \n\n          5% \n\n   \n\n \n\n 32.0 % \n\n    \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n        40 % \n\n \n\n  21.0%    \n\n \n\n         29% \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    80% \n\n 2% \n\n2-D   24.0 %  1% \n\n3-D   27.0 %  1% \n\n4-D  19.0%  4% \n\n\n\nChapter 4-Mix design, properties and durability \n\n \n\nmixture 8A, the one with the highest compressive strength at 14 days and at 28 days is not so \n\nevident for mixture 4A which as a lower fly ash content and a higher w/b. The use of a w/b=0.52 \n\nleads to compressive strength results below 12 MPa after 28 days curing which is a very modest \n\nperformance unsuitable to be used in future applications. The mixture with the lowest 1 day \n\ncompressive strength (6A) is of difficult explanation because it has the same composition of the \n\nmixture with the highest 28 days compressive strength with the exception of the w/b content which \n\nis lower. \n\n \n\nFig. 4.1 Variation of compressive strength with composition and curing days (Phase A) \n\nMixtures based on calcined kaolin and sodium hydroxide revealed lower reactivity than the \n\nmixtures in which this last constituent was replaced by potassium hydroxide. This confirms the \n\nresults obtained by other authors (Xu and Van Deventer, 2000; Diamond, 1976) who also found \n\nthat geopolymers based on several alumino-silicate minerals had a high compressive strength in \n\nKOH than in NaOH. This fact is however independent of the extent of dissolution, being that those \n\nminerals show a higher dissolution when NaOH is used. Fig. 4.2 shows the compressive strength \n\nof the mixtures test in Phase B. The results indicate that a higher compressive strength mixture \n\nwas obtained (11B) reaching 30 MPa after 28 days curing. Environmentally speaking since this \n\nmixture has more 10% OPC and more 15% of calcium hydroxide this mixture does seems as eco-\n\nefficient as the previous mixture 8A. An interesting behaviour can be observed when comparing \n\nthe mixture 11B with mixture 10B.  \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n1-A 2-A 3-A 4-A 5-A 6-A 7-A 8-A 9-A 10-A 11-A 12-A\n\n1 day\n\n7 days\n\n14 days\n\n28 days\n\nC\nc\nC\n\no\nm\n\np\nre\n\ns\ns\niv\n\ne\n s\n\ntr\ne\n\nn\ng\n\nth\n (\n\nM\nP\n\na\n)\n\n\n\nChapter 4-Mix design, properties and durability \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFig. 4.2 Variation of compressive strength with composition and curing days (Phase B) \n\n \n\nThe differences between the two are the fact that mixture 10B includes less 10% of OPC but more \n\n10% in calcium hydroxide and also has a low w/b. As a consequence its compressive strength after \n\n28 days curing is almost 10 MPa apart from mixture 11B. And probably if the w/b was the same \n\nthe compressive strength difference could be even higher. This show the existent of very reactive \n\nconstituents existent in OPC. Again the mixtures where sodium hydroxide was replaced by \n\npotassium hydroxide show a higher compressive strength.

Vs relates to the volume of sand and Vp for the volume of \n\npowder (OPC, FA, Kaolin, Potassium hydroxide and Ca (OH) 2). Increasing the sand content leads \n\nto lower compressive strength because the w/b ratio has also increased in order to maintain the \n\nworkability. Fig. 4.4 shows the compressive strength of the mixtures tested in Phase D. In this \n\nphase the mixture 11B was used as reference in order to evaluate the compressive strength \n\nvariation due to calcium hydroxide content. The calcium hydroxide is presented as a function of \n\nthe Portland cement percentage.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 4.4 Variation of compressive strength with the Ca(OH)2 content and curing days (Mixture 11B) \n\n \n\nThe results show that there is not a direct linear relationship between the calcium hydroxide content \n\nand the compressive strength. The use of calcium hydroxide as much as 50% of Portland cement \n\nleads to the highest compressive strength. Increasing the Ca(OH)2 percentage beyond that \n\npercentage can lead to a decrease in the compressive strength. Concerning the efflorescences no \n\nrelevant presence was observed.

Therefore, Eq. (1) can be adopted for compressive strength of geopolymers \n\nas follows:  \n\n))exp(1(\nn\n\nc\nktf ??? ?                           (2) \n\n\n\nChapter 4-Mix design, properties and durability \n\n \n\nwhere f c is the compressive strength and ? is a constant. Eq. (1) is solved for degree of reaction \n\nvarying between 0 and 1. In Eq. (2), fc is greater than 1 and hence for our case where strengths are \n\nbelow100MPa, we divide the strengths by 100. This normalized number can be included in the \n\nconstant ?. For specimens with higher strengths, one can divide them by a reference number. To \n\ndetermine k and n, Eq.

However, the areas Z2 and Z3, have a much lower C/S ratio which means it \n\nhas some sodium replacing Ca2+ in CSH. Some authors have already demonstrated that sodium \n\nincorporation in CSH phase increased as C/S ratio decreases, and therefore they name it as Na-C-\n\nS-H (Macphee, 1989). The areas marked as Z2 and Z3 are identified as some form of calcium \n\nsilicate with traces of some sodium and aluminum in its composition which could be associated to \n\na (N, C)-A-S-H gel. According to Garcia-Lodeiro et al. (2013), these gels usually evolve into \n\ncompositions with higher calcium and lower aluminum content. Those authors also mention that \n\nthis is a blank field and that almost nothing has been published concerning the interaction between \n\naluminosilicate materials containing sodium (or potassium or sulphates) in the formation of N-A-\n\nS-H or K-A-S-H type cementitious gels. \n\n \n\n4.4 FTIR \n\nThe FTIR spectra are presented in Fig. 4.10. The mix compositions are presented in Table 4.11. \n\nThe strong peak band 965 cm-1 is characterized as asymmetric Si-O-Si or Al-O-Si stretching, \n\n\n\nChapter 4-Mix design, properties and durability \n\n \n\nwhich is typical of the polymerization of the silicate group with the formation of CSH (Garcia \n\nLodeiro et al,. 2008; Garcia Lodeiro et al,. 2009). \n\n \n\nA shift to a high wave number occurs when the different spectra are compared. Usually this \n\nindicates an increase in the Si content of the gel.  \n\n \n\n   The carbonate bands C-O at around 1415 cm_1 and 850 cm_1 arise from the reactions of \n\natmospheric CO2 with calcium hydroxide. This peak intensity changes with the amount of calcium \n\nhydroxide.  \n\n \n\n   The broad bands in the region of 1648\u20133000 cm-1 characterized the spectrum of stretching and \n\ndeformation vibrations of O-H and H\u2013O\u2013H groups from the weakly bound water molecules. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFig. 4.10 FTIR spectra \n\n3000.0 2000 1500 1000 550.0\n\nc m-1\n\n%R \n\nR 1\n\nR 2\n\nR 3\n\nR 4\n\nR 5\n\n\n\nChapter 4-Mix design, properties and durability \n\n \n\n4.5 Mix proportioning  \n\nFor the further investigations by utilizing the obtained results in the previous step 4, new mixes \n\nare added in this phase. In addition to the 4 new mixes, one has been selected from the previous \n\npart. Based on what were concluded until now, the research will be continued by testing the 5 \n\nmixes for obtaining higher compressive results and a high eco-efficient performance. To expand \n\nthe obtained results, durabilty tests will also be performed. The compositions of the dry mixes \n\ncontain the following materials: kaolin, fly ash, ordinary Portland cement (OPC), sodium \n\nhydroxide, calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), water and superplasticizer. These are adapted from the \n\nones presented in the international patent WO 2007/109862 A1 (Zheng et al, 2007). \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4.11 Mix composition  \n\nMix \nOPC/ \n\nPowder* \n\nFly ash/ \n\nPowder \n\nCa(OH)2/\n\nPowder \n\nCalcined \n\nstuff**/ \n\nPowder \n\nSand/ \n\nPowder \n\nSP/ \n\nOPC \n\nWater/ \n\nPowder \n\nOPC 100 (R1) 100 - - - \n\n0.8 0.08 0.35 \n\nOPC 70 \u2013 FL 30 (R2) 70 30 - - \n\nOPC 30-FL 58.3-CH 7.7-CS 4   (R3) 30 58.3 7.7 4 \n\nOPC 26-FL 58.3-CH 7.7-CS 8   (R4) 26 58.3 7.7   8 \n\nOPC 18-FL 58.3-CH 7.7-CS 16  (R5) 18 58.3 7.7 16 \n\n*Powder: OPC + Fly ash + Ca(OH)2 + Calcined stuff \n*Calcined stuff has been prepared by mixing kaolin and sodium hydroxide with 2.5/1 ratio. \n\n \n \n\n4.5.1 Compressive strength \n\nFig. 4.11 shows the compressive strength results. The reduction of OPC content leads to a high \n\nreduction on the compressive strength of the mortars. The slow hydration characteristics of fly ash \n\ncontribute to explain that reduction. The mixture with just 30% OPC (and 58.3 fly ash, 7.7 calcium \n\nhydroxide and 4% calcined stuff) shows an almost 40% reduction in compressive strength when \n\ncompared to the reference mixture. Since this mixture has a higher percentage reduction on OPC \n\ncontent this could mean that the addition of fly ash and calcined stuff could have compensated that \n\nreduction. However, the use of increase content in calcined stuff does not seem to compensate the \n\nOPC reduction. Thus meaning that the use of 4% calcined stuff seems to be an optimum content. \n\n\n\nChapter 4-Mix design, properties and durability \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 4.11 Variation of compressive strength with composition and curing age. \n\n \n\n4.6 Durability \n\nExperimental results will be continued on the durability performance of one-part geopolymers \n\nconcerning penetration of chloride, carbonation resistance and resistance to acid attack.  \n\n \n\n4.6.1 Efflorescences \n\nConcerning the occurrence of efflorescences, no presence was observed. This confirmed the \n\nobservations included in the international related patent. The explanations for that can be related \n\nto the low amount of (sodium/potassium) as well as to the fact that some sodium/potassium \n\nreplaced Ca2+ in CSH hydration products. Another factor that influences efflorescences is pore \n\nvolume and permeability. In Portland cement, the water participates in the hydration products so, \n\nas the hydration progresses, the pore volume decreases over time. However, two part alkali-\n\nactivated binders do not have the same pore volume reduction benefit through the conversion of \n\nwater into a solid via its incorporation into reaction products (Van Deventer et al., 2012), thus \n\nneeding a very low w/b ratio to ensure low permeability. \n\n \n\n4.6.2 Water absorption by immersion \n\nThe results of water absorption by immersion are presented in Fig. 4.12. Since all the mixtures \n\nhave the same w/b ratio they should present a similar open porosity.

That is why the mixture already mention in \n\nthe previous section as having a good compressive strength performance shows the lower open \n\nporosity. \n\n \n \n\nFig. 4.12 Variation of water absorption by immersion with composition.  \n\n \n\n4.6.3 Capillarity water absorption \n\nThe water absorption capillarity coefficients are showed in Fig. 4.13. The reference mixture \n\nshows the best performance. On the opposite side the mixture with 26% OPC 58.3 fly ash, 7.7 \n\ncalcium hydroxide and 8% calcined stuff clearly shows a very high water absorption by capillarity \n\neven at early ages. Such performance is typical of a microstructure with a high amount of capillary \n\npores. Three remaining mixtures show a similar capillary water absorption coefficient indicating \n\na similar internal capillary pore network. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4-Mix design, properties and durability \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 4.13 Variation of Water absorption capillarity coefficient with composition \n\n \n\n4.6.4 Chloride diffusion \n\nFig. 4.14 shows the results of the chloride diffusion coefficient. The results are in accordance \n\nwith the water absorption (open porosity) results. They show that all the mixtures have in the worst \n\ncase a moderate resistance to chloride diffusion when a comparison is made to the performance of \n\nTable 4.12. With the exception of the mixture with 18% OPC 58.3 fly ash, 7.7 calcium hydroxide \n\nand 16% calcined stuff. All the other three mixtures in which OPC was partially replaced by fly \n\nash showed a high resistance to chloride diffusion. \n\n \n\nFig. 4.14 Chloride diffusion coefficient \n\n\n\nChapter 4-Mix design, properties and durability \n\n \n\nTable 4.12 Resistance to chloride penetration (Gjorv, 1996) \n\n\u00d710-12 (m2/s) Concrete resistance \n\n>15 Low \n\n10-15 Moderate \n\n5-10 High \n\n2.5-5 Very high \n\n<2.5 Ultra high \n\n \n\n \n\n4.6.5 Carbonation resistance \n\nFig. 4.15 shows the results of the carbonation resistance. The 100% OPC based mortar showed \n\nthe lowest carbonation depth. Replacing 30% OPC by fly ash leads to a higher carbonation depth. \n\nPart of the explanation is related to the higher capillarity coefficient of the latter and the other part \n\nto the different hydration products.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 4.15 Carbonation depth \n\n   Previous investigations (Khunthongkeaw et al,. 1996) have already reported an increase in \n\nconcrete carbonation when fly-ash (FA) is used. The mixture with 30% OPC, 58.3 FA, 4% \n\ncalcined stuff and 7.7% Ca(OH)2 shows a much higher carbonation depth than the second mixture \n\nwith 30% FA. Since both mixtures have the same capillarity coefficient this means that the \n\ncarbonation behaviour is related exclusively to the different hydration products. Thus meaning that \n\nthe new hydration products are proper to carbonation. The mixture with 26% OPC, 58.3 FA, 8% \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n\nC\na\n\nrb\no\n\nn\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n d\n\ne\np\n\nth\n (\n\nm\nm\n\n)\n\nTime (days)\n\nOPC 100 OPC 70 \u2013 FL 30\n\nOPC 30-FL 58.3-CH 7.7-CS 4 OPC 26-FL 58.3-CH 7.7-CS 8\n\nOPC 18-FL 58.3-CH 7.7-CS 16\n\n\n\nChapter 4-Mix design, properties and durability \n\n \n\ncalcined stuff and 7.7% Ca(OH)2 shows the highest carbonation depth. This result is not a surprise \n\nbecause this mixture has also the highest water absorption capillarity. The mixture with 18% OPC, \n\n58.3 FA, 16% calcined stuff and 7.7% Ca(OH)2 shows almost the same carbonation depth as the \n\nmixture with 30%OPC and just 4% calcined stuff meaning that difference in composition has \n\nlittle influence on carbonation depth. \n\n \n\n4.6.6 Resistance to acid attack \n\nThe results of mass loss for specimens immersed in 10% sulphuric acid solutions are shown in \n\nFig. 4.16.  \n\n \n\nFig. 4.16 Weight loss of specimens due to acid attack \n\nAfter 1 day of immersion the best results are shown by the reference mixture and also by the \n\nmixture in which 30% OPC was replaced by fly ash. Since the reference mixture has much lower \n\ncapillary water absorption than the other mixes, this means that in a short term the rate of acid \n\ningress contributes to explain the observed results. However, this is not the case of the one part \n\ngeopolymeric mixture with 8% calcined stuff because since it has the highest capillarity coefficient \n\nit should have a higher weight loss than the other geopolymeric mixtures.  \n\n \n\nAfter 3 days of immersion in acid solution, one can confirm that the weight loss is proportional to \n\nthe OPC content in the mixtures. A higher OPC content is associated to a lower weight loss. High \n\npozzolan content mixtures showed lower resistance to acid attack this results do not confirm \n\nprevious findings about the fact that the presence of pozzolanic admixtures was found to lower the \n\n\n\nChapter 4-Mix design, properties and durability \n\n \n\ndetrimental effect of acid attack on concrete (Beddoe and Schmidt, 2009; Goyal et al,. 2009) \n\nProbably because a denser microstructure typical of pozzolanic based mixtures were not yet \n\nformed by the time this mixtures were tested (28 days).  \n\n \n\n 4.7 Conclusions \n\n   The investigations concerning mix design, properties and durability of one part geopolymer \n\nmixtures allowed for the following conclusions: \n\nSeveral one part geopolymer mixtures were developed some having a high compressive strength \n\nsuitable for construction purposes. The results show that there is not a direct linear relationship \n\nbetween the calcium hydroxide content and the compressive strength. Still a general trend was \n\nobserved linking compressive strength evolution with curing age, which is typical of OPC \n\nchemistry. Geopolymeric mixtures with 4% calcined stuff seems to correspond to a good \n\ncompromise between a low OPC content and an acceptable compressive strength. A reduction of \n\nOPC content leads to a reduction on the compressive strength of the mixtures being that the \n\naddition of fly ash is not enough to compensate the OPC reduction due to its slow hydration \n\ncharacteristics. Further investigations on mixture composition will be needed in order to select \n\nmixtures with a high compressive strength and a high eco-efficient performance. The applicability \n\nof the Johnson\u2013Mehl\u2013Avrami\u2013Kolmogorov model to predict the compressive strength of one part-\n\ngeopolymers was analysed. The degree of reaction of geopolymers was supposed to be related \n\ndirectly to compressive strength and then Avrami constants and exponents were found for all one \n\npart geopolymers. It was shown that compressive strength evolution of some one part geopolymers \n\ncan be found by the proposed equations. The microstructure of one part geopolymers mortars \n\npresent a very dense and uniform ITZ different of the porous typical interfacial transition zone of \n\nPortland cement mixtures. C/S ratio results show that some sodium is replacing Ca2+ in CSH \n\nwhich is typical of Na-C-S-H hydration products. FTIR spectra, strong peak band around 965 cm-\n\n1 was characterized in the one part geopolymers that attributed stretching vibrations Si-O-Si or Al-\n\nO-Si mode. No efflorescences, were observed. This may be due to the low amount of alkaline \n\nspecies used as well as to the fact that some sodium replaced Ca2+ in CSH hydration products. The \n\ndurability of OPC mortars and one part geopolymer mortars was assessed by water absorption by \n\nimmersion, water absorption by capillarity and resistance to acid attack.

The reason for such comparison as to do with the \n\nfact that foam geopolymer constitutes a recent research field with high potential in the \n\ndevelopment of low toxicity thermal insulators and with low thermal conductivity \n\n(Prud\u00b4homme et al, 2010; Shi et al., 2012, Zhang et al., 2012). Most important the \n\ndevelopment of materials for energy building related applications is a crucial issue \n\nbecause the increasing demand for worldwide energy, is a major cause for the \n\nunsustainable development of our Planet. Between 2007 and 2030 energy demand will \n\ngrow about 40% reaching 16.8 billion tonnes of equivalent petroleum-TEP (Pacheco-\n\nTorgal and Jalali, 2011). The rise in energy consumption has two main reasons, the \n\nincrease in world population and the fact that there are an increasing number of people \n\nwith access to electricity. Currently, 1.5 billion people still have no access to electricity \n\n(UN, 2010). Besides since urban human population will almost double, increasing from \n\napproximately 3.4 billion in 2009 to 6.4 billion in 2050 (WHO, 2014) this will \n\ndramatically increase electricity demand. Beyond what energy consumption means in \n\nterms of using non-renewable fossil materials, the highest environmental impact of energy \n\nconsumption has to do with carbon dioxide emissions, generated during the burning of \n\ncoal and gas for electricity generation in power stations. Given that buildings consume \n\nthroughout their life cycle, more than 40% of all energy produced (OCDE, 2003), we can \n\neasily see the high energy saving potential that this subsector may represent in terms of \n\nreducing carbon dioxide emissions. Energy efficiency is the most cost effective way to \n\nreduce emissions, improve competitiveness and create employment. The Energy Road \n\nMap 2050 (COM 885, 2011) confirmed that higher energy efficiency in new and existing \n\nbuildings is key for the transformation of the EU\u2019s energy system. COM 815 (2011) \n\nmentions that the Union's energy efficiency target of saving 20% of energy by 2020 could \n\ncut consumers\u2019 bills by up to \u20ac1000 per household a year and improving Europe\u2019s \n\nindustrial competitiveness and creating up to 2 million new jobs by 2020. The European \n\nEnergy Performance of Buildings Directive 2002/91/EC (EPBD) has been recast in the \n\nform of the 2010/31/ EU by the European Parliament on 19 May 2010.  One of the new \n\naspects of the EPBD that reflects an ambitious agenda on the reduction of the energy \n\nconsumption is the introduction of the concept of nearly zero-energy building (Pacheco-\n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Performance of foam geopolymers: Two part versus one part \n\n70 \n\n \n\nTorgal et al., 2013). The use of thermal insulation materials constitutes the most effective \n\nway of reducing heat losses in buildings thus reducing heat energy needs. These materials \n\nare very important for the building material industry representing a 21 billion \u20ac market \n\nshare (Pacheco-Torgal, 2014). With the exception of expanded cork, which is based on a \n\nrenewable and completely recyclable material, all the other current insulation materials \n\nare associated with negative impacts in terms of toxicity. Polystyrene, for example \n\ncontains anti-oxidant additives and ignition retardants, additionally, its production \n\ninvolves the generation of benzene and chlorofluorocarbons. On the other hand, \n\npolyurethane is obtained from isocyanates, which are widely known for their tragic \n\nassociation with the Bhopal disaster. Besides, they release toxic fumes when subjected to \n\nfire (Pacheco-Torgal et al., 2012b). Besides recently the European Union approved the \n\nRegulation (EU) 305/2011 related to the Construction Products Regulation (CPR) that \n\nreplaced the current Directive 89/106/CEE, already amended by Directive 1993/68/EEC, \n\nknown as the Construction Products Directive (CPD). A crucial aspect of the new \n\nregulation relates to the information regarding hazardous substances.  \n\n \n\n5.2 Two part foam geopolymers \n\nThe mix parameters were analysed through a laboratory experiment of 54 different two \n\npart geopolymeric mortar mixes were, sodium silicate/sodium hydroxide mass ratio (2.5, \n\n3.5, 4.5), activator/binder mass ratio (0.6, 0.8, 1.0), chemical foaming agent type \n\n(hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium perborate (NaBO3)) and foaming agent mass ratio \n\ncontent (1%, 2%, 3%). \n\nTable 5.1 Mix compositions (%) \n\nMix \nFly ash/ \n\nPowder* \n\nCa(OH)2/ \n\nPowder \n\nSand/ \n\nPowder \n\nSodium silicate/ \n\nSodium hydroxide \n\nActivator/ \n\nBinder \nH2O2\n\n**\n NaBO3 \n\nFL 90-CH 10 90 10 80 \n\n2.5 \n\n3.5 \n\n4.5 \n\n0.6 \n\n0.8 \n\n1.0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n*Powder: Fly ash + Ca(OH)2  \n\n**Foam agent to powder \n\n5.2.1 Properties  \n\nThe results of water absorption by immersion are showed in Fig. 5.1. The lowest water \n\nabsorption by immersion (11.2%) was in a mixture with an activator/binder ratio of 0.8 a \n\nsodium silicate/sodium hydroxide of 4.5 and 3% hydrogen peroxide content. Very similar \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Performance of foam geopolymers: Two part versus one part \n\n71 \n\n \n\nand low water absorption values (12.7%) were found for mixtures with 1% hydrogen \n\nperoxide and a sodium silicate/sodium hydroxide of 2.5. One with an activator/binder \n\nratio of 0.8 and the other with an activator/binder ratio of 1.0. The highest water \n\nabsorption by immersion (27%) were found in a mixture with an activator/binder ratio of \n\n1.0 a sodium silicate/sodium hydroxide of 2.5 and 3% hydrogen peroxide content. A \n\nsimilar high water absorption (27%) was found in a mixture with an activator/binder ratio \n\nof 1.0 a sodium silicate/sodium hydroxide of 3.5 and 3% sodium perborate content and \n\nalso in a mixture with an activator/binder ratio of 0.6 a sodium silicate/sodium hydroxide \n\nof 4.5 and 3% hydrogen peroxide content. This means that concerning water absorption \n\nboth foaming agents allow for high porosity mixtures depending on their content and on \n\nthe ratios activator/binder and sodium silicate/sodium hydroxide.  \n\n \n\nThe results of density are presented in Fig. 5.2. The lowest density results were found in \n\nmixtures with an activator/binder ratio of 0.6 and 3% hydrogen peroxide content. One \n\nwith a sodium silicate/sodium hydroxide of 4.5 (734 kg/m3) and other with a sodium \n\nsilicate/sodium hydroxide of 2.5 (749 kg/m3). As a general trend the increase of foaming \n\nagent leads to a lower density. However, the opposite can also take place. That is the case \n\nof hydrogen peroxide based mixtures with an activator/binder ratio of 1.0 a sodium \n\nsilicate/sodium hydroxide of 3.5. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Performance of foam geopolymers: Two part versus one part \n\n72 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5.1 Water absorption by immersion according to activator/binder ratio and sodium \n\nsilicate/sodium hydroxide mass ratio: a) Activator/binder ratio=1; b) Activator/binder \n\nratio=0.8; Activator/binder ratio=0.6 \n\na) \n\nb) \n\nc) \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Performance of foam geopolymers: Two part versus one part \n\n73 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5.2 Density according to activator/binder ratio and sodium silicate/sodium hydroxide mass \n\nratio: a) Activator/binder ratio=1; b) Activator/binder ratio=0.8; Activator/binder ratio=0.6 \n\n \n\na) \n\nb) \n\nc) \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Performance of foam geopolymers: Two part versus one part \n\n74 \n\n \n\nFig. 5.3 shows the results of the thermal conductivity. Thermal conductivity was executed \n\non specimens, which had low density (lower than 900 kg/m3) and compressive strength \n\nabove 3 MPa. The missing values are related to high density mixtures. The lowest thermal \n\nconductivity performance was achieved (0.113 W/m.\u00baK) in a mixture with an \n\nactivator/binder ratio of 0.8 a sodium silicate/sodium hydroxide of 2.5 and 3% sodium \n\nperborate content. A similar thermal conductivity was obtain in a mixture with the same \n\nactivator/binder ratio, the same sodium silicate/sodium hydroxide ratio and 1% sodium \n\nperborate content (0.1195 W/m.\u00baK). A mixture with the same sodium silicate/sodium \n\nhydroxide of 2.5 with an activator/binder ratio of 0.6 and 2% hydrogen peroxide content \n\nalso lead to a low thermal conductivity (0.1293 W/m.\u00baK).  \n\n \n\n   Another sodium perborate based mixtures with an activator/binder ratio of 1.0 and a \n\nsodium silicate/sodium hydroxide of 4.5 also led to a low thermal conductivity (0.1187 \n\nW/m.\u00baK). These results outperform the thermal conductivity of commercial autoclaved \n\naerated concrete masonry blocks (Ytong) of around (0.17 W/m.\u00baK). No valid statistic \n\ncorrelation was found between thermal conductivity and density (Fig. 5.4). Different \n\nsodium silicate/sodium hydroxide ratios and different activator/binder ratios could explain \n\nthis. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Performance of foam geopolymers: Two part versus one part \n\n75 \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\nFig. 5.3 Thermal conductivity according to activator/binder ratio and sodium silicate/sodium \n\nhydroxide mass ratio: a) Activator/binder ratio=1; b) Activator/binder ratio=0.8; \n\nActivator/binder ratio=0.6 \n\na) \n\nb) \n\nc) \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Performance of foam geopolymers: Two part versus one part \n\n76 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5.4 Thermal conductivity versus density: a) Hydrogen peroxide based geopolymers; \n\nb) Sodium perborate based geopolymers; c) both \n\nb) \n\nc) \n\na) \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Performance of foam geopolymers: Two part versus one part \n\n77 \n\n \n\nFig. 5.5 shows the results of the compressive strength. Low compressive strength results \n\n(below 3 MPa) were found in hydrogen peroxide mixtures (2 and 3%) with an \n\nactivator/binder ratio of 0.8 and a sodium silicate/sodium hydroxide of 2.5. It is important \n\nto mention that the mixtures with a low thermal conductivity previously mentioned \n\nshowed a compressive strength in the range of 4.5-6.0 MPa while commercial autoclaved \n\naerated concrete masonry blocks have an average compressive strength above 4,5 MPa.  \n\nNo valid statistic correlation was found between compressive strength and density due to \n\nthe variation of the results and the limited number of test samples (Fig. 5.6).  \n\nFigs. 5.7-5.9 show the microstructure of three foam geopolymer mixtures. Their \n\ncomposition is shown in table 5.1 while the EDS atomic ratios of two points for each \n\nmixture are presented also in table 5.2.  \n\nTable 5.2 EDS atomic ratios \n\n \n\n   The microstructure of the three samples shows different level of unreacted fly ash \n\nparticles. This is consistent with their compressive strength respectively 4.6 MPa, 5.36 \n\nMPa and 6.89 MPa. All EDS atomic ratios show a low C/S ratio. Typical C/S ratios in \n\nCSH of traditional OPC systems are situated from 1.5 to 2.0 (Diamond, 1976). Meaning \n\nthere has been some sodium replacing Ca2+ in CSH. Some authors have already \n\ndemonstrated that sodium incorporation in the CSH phase increases as C/S ratio decreases \n\n(Macphee, 1989).  \n\nAll EDS analysis show hydration products with a SiO2/Al2O3 higher than the original \n\nSiO2/Al2O3 fly ash ratio which is explained by the Si species added through the used of \n\nthe sodium silicate. FG B and FG C show similar SiO2/Al2O3 atomic ratios although they \n\nused very different sodium silicate contents in their composition. This could mean that the \n\nextra Si species have not contributed to the formation of the hardened alkaline \n\naluminosilicate structure and that an optimum sodium silicate content exists. \n\n \n\n Fly ash                                                             FG A FG B FG C \n\nZ1 Z2 Z1 Z2 Z1 Z2 \n\nSiO2/Al2O3 3.05 19.57 10.33 9.86 9.78 9.92 8.24 \n\nAl2O3/Na2O 16.75 0.13 0.14 0.30 0.15 0.45 0.63 \n\nCaO/SiO2 0.05 0.47 0.1 0.27 0.14 0.28 0.28 \n\nNa2O/CaO 0.38 0.78 6.49 1.22 4.35 0.75 0.67 \n\nMgO/Al2O3 0.13 0.57 0.29 0.27 0.44 0.31 0.38 \n\nFe2O3/Al2O3 0.19 0.30 0.09 0.14 0.08 0.24 0.16 \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Performance of foam geopolymers: Two part versus one part \n\n78 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5.5 Compressive strength according to activator/binder ratio and sodium silicate/sodium \n\nhydroxide mass ratio: a) Activator/binder ratio=1; b) Activator/binder ratio=0.8; \n\nActivator/binder ratio=0.6 \n\na) \n\nb) \n\nc) \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Performance of foam geopolymers: Two part versus one part \n\n79 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5.6 Compressive strength versus density: a) Hydrogen peroxide based geopolymers; \n\nb) Sodium perborate based geopolymers; c) both \n\nc) \n\na) \n\nb) \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Performance of foam geopolymers: Two part versus one part \n\n80 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5.7 SEM mix FGA \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Performance of foam geopolymers: Two part versus one part \n\n81 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5.8 SEM mix FGB  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Performance of foam geopolymers: Two part versus one part \n\n82 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5.9 SEM mix FGC  \n\n   The FTIR spectra of the three hardened foam geopolymer mixtures (table 5.3) are \n\npresented in Fig. 5.10.

Regarding the \n\nmixture 30 OPC_58.3 FA_4 CS_7.7 CH an increase of the aluminium content results in a \n\nreduction for compressive strength. Increasing NaBO3 from 1% to 5% reduced the \n\ncompressive strength with some exceptions. The exceptions were found when the NaBO3 \n\ncontent increased from 1% to 2% and 4.5% to 5%. Since, no specific trend was observed \n\nin compressive strength of the mixture 30 OPC_58.3 FA_4 CS_7.7 CH that used H2O2.  \n\n \n\n   Comparing the performance of the different foaming agents the higher compressive \n\nstrength (7 MPa) took place for a 0.5% AL content.

Results \n\nof compressive strength in mixture 26 OPC_58.3 FA_8 CS_7.7 CH show that there is an \n\nincrease in compressive strength when the Al content increased. The increase in density \n\ncan related to pore collapses as suggested by these authors (Masi et al., 2014). Those \n\nauthors also confirm that aluminium powder is very reactive requiring a much less amount \n\nthan hydrogen peroxide to obtain similar densities. However since the former costs 33 \n\nmore than the later (section 5.3.2) it is important to compare the economic performance of \n\nthe different mixtures. Although an exception discovered when the aluminium content \n\nincreased from 0.5% to 1%. Since, no specific trend was observed in compressive strength \n\nof the mixture 30 OPC_58.3 FA_4 CS_7.7 CH that used NaBO3.

Except when the NaBO3 increased from 4% to 4.5% lead to a compressive \n\nstrength reduction. Respect to the use of H2O2 the increase of foaming agent results in \n\nreduction of compressive strength. By comparing the performance of the different \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Performance of foam geopolymers: Two part versus one part \n\n93 \n\n \n\nfoaming agents it can be concluded that the higher compressive strength (6.11 MPa) was \n\nmeasured for a 5% NaBO3 content. The overall results show that several mixtures show a \n\ncompressive strength similar to the one of commercial cellular concrete blocks (6.5 MPa).  \n\n \n\n   However most mixtures comply with the compressive strength requirement (?1.4 MPa) \n\nof the grades 4 and 5 of the Korean Industrial Standard code for foam concrete for floor \n\nheating systems (Yang et al., 2014). \n\n \n\n   Results of water absorption of one-part geopolymer mortars are shown in Fig. 5.17. For \n\nmortars based on Portland cement, the increase of the aluminium content does not leads to \n\na relevant change in water absorption. When it increases from 1.2% to 1.5% leads to the \n\nslight water absorption decrease. When the NaBO3 is used as foaming agent in Portland \n\ncement mortars a trend on water absorption increase with foaming agent increase can be \n\nnoticed. However, some exceptions are detected. The increase from 3% to 3.5% and the \n\nincrease from 4% to 4.5% that lead to a water absorption reduction. Concerning the use of \n\nH2O2 the increase of foaming agent from 3% to 3.5% shows a minor increase in the water \n\nabsorption but when the foaming agent is increased above 3.5% no water absorption is \n\ndetected. Comparing the performance of the different foaming agents on Portland cement \n\nmortars it is seen that the highest water absorption (62%) took place for a 5% \n\nNaBO3 content.  \n\n \nFig. 5.17 Water absorption \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Performance of foam geopolymers: Two part versus one part \n\n94 \n\n \n\n   However, this mixture shows a foaming efficiency (water absorption/foaming agent \n\ncontent= 12) that is lower than other mixtures based on aluminium foaming agent that \n\nshow higher water absorption levels with just 0.5% content (efficiency= 90). Concerning \n\nthe mixtures 30 OPC_70 FA, the increase of the aluminium content leads to a slight \n\nincrease in water absorption. When the aluminium increases from 1.2% to 1.5% a slight \n\nwater absorption decrease was detected. When the NaBO3 is used as foaming agent in this \n\nmixture a trend on water absorption decrease with foaming agent increase registered.  \n\n \n\n   However, there was an exception. When the NaBO3 increased from 4% to 4.5% leads to \n\na water absorption reduction. Regarding the use of H2O2 the increase of foaming agent \n\ndepicts a minor decrease in the water absorption but when the foaming agent is increased \n\nabove 4% slight increase in water absorption is detected. Comparing the performance of \n\nthe different foaming agents on the mixture 30 OPC_70 FA it is revealed that the higher \n\nwater absorption (50.53%) recorded for 1.5% Al content. In respect to the mixtures 30 \n\nOPC_58.3 FA_4 CS_7.7 CH, an increase of the aluminium content leads to an increase of \n\nwater absorption. The increase from 0.8% to 1% and 1.2%to 1.5% decrease the water \n\nabsorption. When the NaBO3 is used as foaming agent, a decrease was detected by \n\nincreasing foam agent content. Although some exceptions were detected from 1% to 2% \n\nand 4% to 5% which lead to water absorption increase.  \n\n \n\n   Concerning the use of H2O2 the increase of foaming agent leads to reduce in water \n\nabsorption with one exception. The exception was monitored in an increase of foam agent \n\nfrom 4% to 4.5% which leads to increase in water absorption. Comparing the performance \n\nof the different foaming agents it is found that the higher water absorption (81.07%) took \n\nplace for a 4.5% H2O2 content. This corresponds to an efficiency of (81.07/4.5= 18) while \n\nAl mixtures show high efficiencies (40/1.2=33.3).Concerning the mixtures 26 OPC_58.3 \n\nFA_8 CS_7.7 CH, an increase of the aluminium content leads to a slight decrease in water \n\nabsorption with one exception. The exception was measured when the use of \n\nAL increased from 0.5% to 1% and a minor increase in the water absorption was detected.  \n\n \n\n   When the NaBO3 is used as foaming agent a trend on water absorption is almost \n\nconstant with no increase, regardless increasing foam agent content. In respect to the use \n\nof H2O2 the increase of foaming agent shows no change in the water absorption. The \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Performance of foam geopolymers: Two part versus one part \n\n95 \n\n \n\nperformance of different foaming agents on this mixture showed that the higher water \n\nabsorption (72.72%) was registered for a 3% NaBO3 content. Additionally, some similar \n\nhigh water absorptions observed for this mixture with 1.2% Al (72.31%), 1.5% AL \n\n(72.22%), 3.5% NaBO3 (72.27%), and 5% NaBO3 (72.70%). Concerning the mixture 30 \n\nOPC_58.3 FA_16 CS_7.7 CH, an increase of the aluminium content leads to an increase \n\nin water absorption. When the NaBO3 is used a trend on water absorption reduction with \n\nfoaming agent content increase can be noticed. However, some exceptions are acquired.  \n\n \n\n   The increase of NaBO3 from 3% to 3.5% and the increase of NaBO3 from 4.5% to 5% \n\nlead to a water absorption increase. Regarding the use of H2O2, by increasing foam agent \n\ncontent no increase in water absorption is discovered. Comparing the performance of the \n\ndifferent foaming agents on the mixture 30 OPC_58.3 FA_16 CS_7.7 CA it is seen that \n\nthe higher water absorption (81.48%) took place for a 5% NaBO3 content.  \n\n \n\n   The results of bulk density of one-part geopolymer mortars are shown in Fig. 5.18. For \n\nmortars based on Portland cement an increment in the aluminium content leads to a \n\ndecrease in bulk density. When the NaBO3 is employed in Portland cement mortars a \n\ntrend on bulk density decrease with foaming agent content increase can be noticed.  \n\n \nFig. 5.18 Bulk density \n\n   Concerning the use of H2O2 the increase of foaming agent show a minor increase in the \n\nbulk density but when the foaming agent is increased between 4% to 4.5% slight decrease \n\nin bulk density was detected.

Concerning the mixture 30 OPC_70 FA the increase of \n\nthe aluminium content leads to decrease in bulk density. Except when it increases from \n\n1% to 1.2% lead to the slight bulk density increase. When the NaBO3 is used a trend can \n\nbe noticed on bulk density increase. Regarding the use of H2O2 the increase of foaming \n\nagent from 3% to 4% show a decrease in the bulk density but when the foaming agent is \n\nincreased above 4% an increase in the bulk density were registered. The lowest bulk \n\ndensity (785 kg/m3) took place for a 4.5% H2O2 content. In respect to results of bulk \n\ndensity for mixture 30 OPC_58.3 FA_4 CS_7.7 CH increasing the aluminium content \n\nleads to reduce bulk density. Except when it increases from 0.8% to 1% which lead to the \n\nslight bulk density increase. Increasing the NaBO3 content results in increasing bulk \n\ndensity, except when it increases from 4% to 4.5% which leads to the slight bulk density \n\ndecrease. Concerning the use of H2O2 the increase of foaming agent show a constant trend \n\nin bulk density results. Comparing the obtained results by using different foaming agents \n\nit is observed that the lowest bulk density (821 kg/m3) took place for a 1.2% Al content.  \n\n \n\n   Concerning the mixture 26 OPC_58.3 FA_8 CS_7.7 CH an increasing the aluminium \n\ncontent from 0.5% to 1% leads to slight increase in bulk density. By increasing Al content \n\nmore than 0.8% results in constant trend in bulk density and no increase was detected.  \n\n \n\n   Respect to the increase in NaBO3 content as foam agent, no change was observed. When \n\nNaBO3 content increased from 4% to 4.5% a slight increase in bulk density was noticed.  \n\n \n\n   The use of H2O2 shows a slight decrease from 3% to 3.5%. Increasing H2O2 content \n\nmore than 3.5% did not show any change in bulk density. Comparing the results obtained \n\nfrom using different foaming agents, it is revealed that the lowest bulk density (980 \n\nkg/m3) measured for a 4% H2O2 content. Concerning the mixture 18 OPC_58.3 FA_16 \n\nCS_7.7 CH. the increase of the aluminium content leads to reduce of bulk density. \n\nIncreasing of NaBo3 content, results in reduction of bulk density. However some \n\nexceptions were detected. Increasing NaBO3 from 3% to 3.5% and 4% to 4.5% lead to \n\nslight increase in bulk density.  The increase of H2O2  foam agent content leads to \n\ndecrease of bulk density. Except from 4.5% to 5% which show an increase in the bulk \n\ndensity. The lowest bulk density (654 kg/m3) recorded for a 4.5% H2O2 content. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Performance of foam geopolymers: Two part versus one part \n\n97 \n\n \n\n   Fig. 5.19 presents the results of thermal conductivity performance of some one part \n\nfoam geopolymer mixtures. Thermal conductivity test was not carried out on all one-part \n\ngeopolymer mixtures. Instead, two criteria were considered to select the mixtures for \n\nthermal conductivity testing, a) Mixtures with compressive strength greater than 2 MPa; \n\nb) Mixtures with bulk density lower than 1100 kg/m3. The lowest thermal conductivity \n\nperformance (0.132 W/m.K) was recorded for one-part geopolymer mortars, in mix 30 \n\nOPC+58.3 FA+4 CS_7.7 CH and 1.2% Al. Furthermore, a close value of thermal \n\nconductivity was measured for the same mixture with 1.5% aluminium powder. As the \n\nthermal conductivity of commercial autoclaved aerated concrete masonry blocks (Ytong) \n\nis around (0.17 W/m.K), similar thermal conductivity performances can be considered \n\nacceptable for thermal insulator like cementitious materials.  The mixture 26 OPC+58.3 \n\nFA+8 CS_7.7 CH with 3.5% hydrogen peroxide shows an acceptable thermal \n\nconductivity of 0.16 W/m.K because it fits the threshold of the grades 4 and 5 of the \n\nKorean Industrial Standard code for foam concrete for floor heating systems (Yang et al., \n\n2014). \n\n \nFig. 5.19 Thermal conductivity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Performance of foam geopolymers: Two part versus one part \n\n98 \n\n \n\n5.3.2 Cost analysis \n\nThe cost of materials are listed in Table 5.7 which shows that the Al powder foaming \n\nagent has a much higher cost than the other two foaming agents. The cost of mixtures is \n\npresented in Fig. 5. 20.  \n\nTable 5.7 Costs of the materials (euro/kg) \n\nSand OPC \nCa (OH)2 Fly \n\nash \nKaolin \n\nSodium \n\nhydroxide \nWater SP H2O2 NaBO3 AL \n\n0.02 0.1 0.3 0.03 0.29 0.85 0.1 0.82 0.98 1.5 32.4 \n\n \n\n   The results show that using Al powder leads to a significant increase of the cost of \n\ngeopolymers mixtures. The most cost-efficient mixtures (67 euro/m3) were obtained for \n\n26 OPC+58.3 FA+8 CS+7.7 CH with 3.5% hydrogen peroxide foaming agent. The use of \n\nmixtures based on aluminium powder is not feasible because they are not cost-efficient at \n\nall. The mixture based on aluminium powder foaming agent with the lowest cost (30 \n\nOPC+58.3 FA+4 CS+7.7 CH) costs more than 200 euro/m3. This represents more than \n\ntwice the cost of Ytong masonry blocks (70-80 euro/m3). It is worth remember that foam \n\nmortars based on classical two part geopolymers have a cost above 300 euro/m3 \n\n(Abdollahnejad et al., 2015). Fig. 5.20 also includes cost simulations for two scenarios: a) \n\nCarbon social cost of 34.7 euro/ton as per US study (Standford, 2015); b) Carbon social \n\ncost of 206.3 euro/ton (Moore and Diaz, 2015). When the cost of the mixtures includes the \n\ncost of carbon dioxide emissions mixtures based on hydrogen peroxide show a high \n\nincrease in its cost. A minor increase is noticed in aluminium powder based mixtures. The \n\nresults confirm that in both scenarios the mixture 26 OPC+58.3 FA+8 CS+7.7 CH with \n\n3.5% hydrogen peroxide foaming agent is still the most cost-efficient. The results of the \n\ncost to thermal resistance ratio are presented in Fig. 5.21 The best ratio was detected for \n\nthe mixture 26 OPC+58.3 FA+8 CS+7.7 CH around 10 euro/(m.K/W).  \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Performance of foam geopolymers: Two part versus one part \n\n99 \n\n \n\nFig. 5.20 Cost of one-part geopolymer mixtures: Gray bars) Materials cost; Red bars) \n\nMaterials cost for a carbon cost in scenario 1; Green bars) Materials cost for a carbon cost in \n\nscenario 2  \n\n \nFig. 5.21 Cost to thermal resistance ratio \n\n30 OPC_58.5 FA_4CS_7.7CH \n\n100 OPC \n\n \n\n30 OPC_ \n\n70 FA \n26 OPC_ \n\n58.5 FA_ \n\n8CS_ \n\n7.7CH \n\n18 OPC_ \n\n58.5 FA_ \n\n16CS_ \n\n7.7CH \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Performance of foam geopolymers: Two part versus one part \n\n100 \n\n \n\n5.3.3 Global warming potential \n\nThe global warming potential GWP (KgCO2e) was assessed using EcoInvent database. \n\nFig. 5.22 presents the global warming potential to thermal resistance ratio. The results \n\nshow that mixtures with similar thermal conductivity performance have a much different \n\nglobal warming potential to thermal resistance ratio. This parameter is influenced by the \n\npercentage of Portland cement. Higher percentages are associated with higher ratios of \n\nglobal warming potential to thermal resistance ratios. Even the mixtures containing \n\nsodium hydroxide have a lower ratio because although the GWP of NaOH is 2.65 higher \n\nthan the GWP of Portland cement the amount of OPC used in those mixtures is much \n\nhigher. The mixture 26 OPC+58.3 FA+8 CS+7.7 CH with 3.5% hydrogen peroxide \n\nfoaming has a global warming potential of 443 KgCO2eq/m\n3. \n\n \n\nFig. 5.22 Global warming potential to thermal resistance ratio  \n\n \n\n \n\n5.4 Conclusions \n\nThe results of two part foam geopolymers show that the sodium perborate over performs \n\nhydrogen peroxide leading to a lower overall thermal conductibility of foam geopolymers. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Performance of foam geopolymers: Two part versus one part \n\n101 \n\n \n\nThe use of an activator/binder ratio of 0.8 and a sodium silicate/sodium hydroxide of 2.5 \n\nled to the lowest thermal conductivity. Mixtures with a low thermal conductivity of \n\naround 0.1 W/(m.\u00baK) and a compressive strength of around 6 MPa were achieved. The \n\ncost analysis show the foaming agents are responsible for a small percentage of foam \n\ngeopolymers total cost (less than 10%) being that the alkaline activators are responsible \n\nfor more than 80%.  \n\n \n\n   Concerning foam one part geopolymer mixtures the results show that the use of \n\naluminium powder is very effective in obtaining foam materials with low thermal \n\nconductivity. An increase of bulk density with aluminium powder content was noticed \n\nthat could be related to pore collapses. Aluminium powder allows the production of \n\nmortar mixtures with a compressive strength above 6MPa however, its high cost means \n\nthey are commercially useless when facing the competition of commercial cellular \n\nconcrete. The mortar mixture based on aluminium powder mortar with the lowest cost (30 \n\nOPC+58.3 FA+4 CS+7.7 CH) costs more than 200 euro/m3. This represents more than \n\ntwice the cost of Ytong masonry blocks (70-80 euro/m3). It is worth remember that foam \n\nmortars based on classical two part geopolymers have a cost above 300 euro/m3 which \n\nshows that two part geopolymers are not a cost-effective solution for thermal insulation \n\nmaterials. The mixture 26 OPC+58.3 FA+8 CS+7.7 CH with 3.5% hydrogen peroxide \n\nshows an acceptable compressive strength and thermal conductivity complying with the \n\nrequirements of the grades 4 and 5 of the Korean Industrial Standard code for foam \n\nconcrete for floor heating systems (?1.4 MPa and ?0.16 W/m.K). This mixture is cost \n\nefficient (67 euro/m3) and has a low global warming potential of 443 KgCO2eq/m\n3. When \n\nthe cost of the mixtures includes the cost of carbon dioxide emissions mixtures based on \n\nhydrogen peroxide show a high increase in its cost. A minor increase is noticed in \n\naluminium powder based mixtures. The results confirm that in both carbon dioxide social \n\ncost scenarios the mixture 26 OPC+58.3 FA+8 CS+7.7 CH with 3.5% hydrogen peroxide \n\nfoaming agent is still the most cost-efficient. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n103 \n \n\n6.1 Conclusions and suggestions for further investigations \n\n \n   The production of Portland cement as the essential constituent of concrete requires considerable \n\nenergy, releasing a significant amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) into \n\natmosphere. Environmental concerns regarding the high CO2 emissions related to the production \n\nof ordinary Portland cement (OPC) led to research efforts on the development of eco-efficient \n\nalternative binders.  \n\n \n\nGeopolymers constitute promising inorganic binders alternative to OPC which are based on \n\naluminosilicates by-products and alkali activators. The geopolymerization technology is a \n\ncomplex chemical process evolving dissolution of raw materials, transportation, orientation and \n\npolycondensation of the reaction products. However, there are still many drawbacks associated \n\nwith traditional two part geopolymer mixes. The caustic alkaline solutions needed to form the \n\ngeopolymers make the handling and application of geopolymers difficult. Also, workability is \n\ngenerally poor and not easily adjustable due to a sticky and thick mortar that is generated during \n\nprocessing. The system is also sensitive to the ratio of alkaline and soluble silicate, which is \n\ndifficult to control in practice. Also two part geopolymers carbon footprint is dependent on the \n\nfact that sodium silicate usage is avoided. The durability of two part geopolymers is also subject \n\nof some controversy. Some authors state that the durability of these materials constitutes the most \n\nimportant advantage over Portland cement others argue that it is an unproven issue. For instance \n\ncurrent two part geopolymeric mixes can suffer from efflorescence originated by the fact that \n\nalkaline or soluble silicates that are added during processing cannot be totally consumed during \n\ngeopolymerisation. This leads to high permeability and water absorption due to the movement of \n\nalkali together with water to the geopolymer surfaces. Therefore, new and improved geopolymer \n\nmixes are needed. \n\n \n\nThe discovery of one-part geopolymers is considered as a key event on the evolution of low \n\ncarbon geopolymer technology in the \u201cjust add water\u201d concept. However they were associated \n\nwith very low compressive strength. Some authors even report a compressive strength decrease \n\nwith time for one-part geopolymers based on calcined red mud and sodium hydroxide blends. The \n\npresent thesis aimed to develop some one part geopolymer mixtures that could be of some use for \n\nthe construction industry. The experimental and numerical results allows for the following \n\nconclusions \n\n\n\n104 \n \n\nSeveral one part geopolymer mixtures were developed some having a high compressive strength \n\nsuitable for construction purposes. The results show that there is not a direct linear relationship \n\nbetween the calcium hydroxide content and the compressive strength. Still a general trend was \n\nobserved linking compressive strength evolution with curing age, which is typical of OPC \n\nchemistry. The applicability of the Johnson\u2013Mehl\u2013Avrami\u2013Kolmogorov model to predict the \n\ncompressive strength of one part-geopolymers was analysed. The degree of reaction of \n\ngeopolymers was supposed to be related directly to compressive strength and then Avrami \n\nconstants and exponents were found for all one part geopolymers. It was shown that compressive \n\nstrength evolution of some one part geopolymers can be found by the proposed equations. The \n\nmicrostructure of one part geopolymers mortars present a very dense and uniform ITZ different of \n\nthe porous typical interfacial transition zone of Portland cement mixtures.C/S ratio results show \n\nthat some sodium is replacing Ca2+ in CSH which is typical of Na-C-S-H hydration products. No \n\nefflorescences, no presence was observed. This may be due to the low amount of alkaline species \n\nused as well as to the fact that some sodium replaced Ca2+ in CSH hydration products.  \n\n \n\nThe investigations on foam geopolymers show that in two part mixtures the sodium perborate \n\nover performs hydrogen peroxide leading to a lower overall thermal conductibility. The use of an \n\nactivator/binder ratio of 0.8 and a sodium silicate/sodium hydroxide of 2.5 led to the lowest \n\nthermal conductivity. Mixtures with a low thermal conductivity of around 0.1 W/(m.\u00baK) and a \n\ncompressive strength of around 6 MPa were achieved. The cost analysis show the foaming agents \n\nare responsible for a small percentage of foam geopolymers total cost (less than 10%) being that \n\nthe alkaline activators are responsible for more than 80%. Concerning one part geopolymers the \n\nresults show that the use of aluminium powder is very effective in obtaining foam materials with \n\nlow thermal conductivity. An increase of bulk density with aluminium powder content was \n\nnoticed that can be related to pore collapses. Aluminium powder allows the production of mortar \n\nmixtures with a compressive strength above 6MPa however its high cost means they are \n\ncommercially useless when facing the competition of commercial cellular concrete. The mixture \n\n26 OPC+58.3 FA+8 CS+7.7 CH with 3.5% hydrogen peroxide shows an acceptable compressive \n\nstrength and thermal conductivity complying with the requirements for foam concrete for floor \n\nheating systems (?1.4 MPa and ?0.16 W/m.K). This mixture is cost efficient (67 euro/m3) and has \n\na low global warming potential of 443 kg CO2eq/m\n3. The results confirm that in both carbon \n\ndioxide social cost scenarios the mixture 26 OPC+58.3 FA+8 CS+7.7 CH with 3.5% hydrogen \n\nperoxide foaming agent is still the most cost-efficient. \n\n \n\n\n\n105 \n \n\nConcerning applications foam one part geopolymers could also be used in the production of \n\nlightweight masonry units an issue that should merit future investigations.  Other issues that \n\nshould be investigated include the assessment of alkali-silica reaction not only because of its \n\nalkali components but also because of the presence of calcium. The study of the pH conditions of \n\nthese materials is needed because this is crucial to prevent the corrosion of steel reinforcement. \n\nThe study of one part geopolymer mixtures based on other by products and industrial wastes with \n\npozzolanic properties will also be needed to enhance the body of knowledge of these materials.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                 106 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                           REFERENCES \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                 107 \n \n\nAbdollahnejad Z., Pacheco-Torgal F., Aguiar A., \u201cMix design, properties and cost analysis of fly ash-based \n\ngeopolymer\u201d, Construction and Building Materials, 2015; 8: 18-30. \n\n \n\nAbdollahnejad Z., Hlavacek P., Miraldo S., Pacheco-Torgal F., Aguiar J., \u201cCompressive strength, \n\nmicrostructure and hydration products of hybrid alkaline cements\u201d, Materials Research. 2014; 17:221-227. \n\n \n\nAllahverdi A., Najafi Kani E., \u201cConstruction wastes as raw materials for geopolymer binders\u201d, International \n\nJournal of Civil Engeneering. 2009; 7:154\u201360. \n\n \n\nAllahverdi A., \u0160kv\u00e1ra F., \u201cNitric acid attack on hardened paste of geopolymeric cements- Part 1\u201d, Ceramics-\n\nSilikaty, 2001; 45:81\u20138. \n\n \n\nAllahverdi A., \u0160kv\u00e1ra F., \u201cSulfuric acid attack on hardened paste of geopolymer cements- Part 2\u201d, Corrosion \n\nmechanism at mild and  relatively low concentrations  \u2013 Part 2.
