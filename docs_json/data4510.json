Cytogenetic and molecular characterization of two \npopulations of minnows Astyanax gitonEigenmann 1908 \nandAstyanax aff. fasciatus(Characiformes: Characidae) in the S\u00e3o \nBartolomeuCreek, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Adviser: Jorge Abdala \nDergam Dos Santos. \n\n\u00a0\n\nNeotropical freshwater fish are the most abundant vertebrate species, with \n\nCharacidae fish representing the greatest diversity among them. The genus \n\nAstyanax contains approximately 130 species, all of which are currently \n\nconsidered incertae sedis in systematic terms. Because of vague original \n\ndescriptions, many local populations are difficult to identify. In these cases, \n\nthe combined analysis of morphological, cytogenetic and molecular data may \n\nprovide useful information for determining their taxonomic status. We applied \n\nthis approach on two populations of Astyanax occurring in the S\u00e3o \n\nBartolomeu Creek of Minas Gerais State, Brazil, a tributary of the Doce River \n\nBasin. Morphological characters included the analysis of lateral line scales, \n\nteeth, anal fin rays. Cytogenetic techniques included conventional coloration \n\n(Giemsa), heterochromatin patterns (C-Banding), nucleolar organizer regions \n\n(NORs) and fluorescentin situ hybridization (FISH). Molecular techniques \n\nwere performed using a 634 bp cytochrome oxidase subunit I fragment of \n\nmitochondrial DNA. All characters indicate that both species are Astyanax \n\ngiton and Astyanax fasciatus respectively. The karyotypes of \n\n4m+18sm+22st+6t for 10m+20sm+12st+6t and A. giton and Astyanax \n\naff.fasciatus respectively had not been previously reported, and for A. giton, \n\nthis is the second karyotype in the Doce River Basin and the first incidence of \n\nB chromosomes. The mtDNA sequence COI indicate that A. giton is closely \n\nassociated to other A. giton from the same basin and more distantly related \n\nto Astyanax scabripinnis and Astyanax intermedius, whereas Astyanax \n\n\n\nx\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\naff.fasciatus forms a strongly supported clade with A. fasciatus from other \n\nbasins and A. parahybae. \n\n\n\n1\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nLITERATURE REVIEW \n\n \n\nFew published works exist regarding Astyanax giton. According to Fishbase, \n\nA. giton is found in the Para\u00edba do Sul River Basin and coastal streams of \n\nEsp\u00edrito Santo and Rio de Janeiro States, Brazil [1]. Recently, A. giton has been \n\nfound in the Sossego Creek in Vi\u00e7osa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil [2]. \n\n Eigenmann [3] defined A. giton by the following characteristics: Snout \n\nmore than half the length of the eye; two or three teeth in the front row of the \n\npremaxillary; a caudal band, depth 2.5 to 2.6; eye 2.5; anal fin with 23-24 rays; \n\n34 scales on the lateral line with 5 above and four below as well as a diffuse \n\n(sometimes absent) vertically elongate humeral spot crossing the third scale of \n\nthe lateral line. Eigenmann based these characters on two specimens from the \n\nRio Para\u00edba in Eastern Brazil. \n\n Astyanax giton from the Para\u00edba do Sul River Basin, Serra da Bocaina, \n\nS\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil presented a diploid number of 2n=50 and a karyotype of \n\n6m+8sm+8st+28t, FN=72 [4]. Both A. giton and A. intermedius from this river \n\nshowed five chromosome pairs bearing 5SrDNA sites, all telocentrics except for \n\none subtelocentric in A. giton. The occurrence of the same number of 5S rDNA \n\nsites in similar locations supports the proximity of these species [4,5]. \n\n Populations of A. giton from the Paraitinga River and Jacu\u00ed Stream \n\npresented the same diploid number and karyotype as those from the Para\u00edba do \n\nSul River Basin [4,6]. In the Paraitinga River and Jacu\u00ed Stream, C-banding \n\nrevealed heterochromatin in the interstitial regions of chromosomes 4, 5, 6 and 9 \n\nas well as in the pericentromeric regions of many chromosomes. Silver nitrate \n\nstaining in the nucleolar organizer regions (Ag-NOR) from two sites on the \n\nParaitinga River showed multiple NORs, up to six markings, and fluorescent in \n\nsitu hybridization with the 18S rDNA probe revealed up to ten markings, many of \n\nthem very reduced [5]. \n\nThe karyotype and heterochromatin of A. giton from the Paraitinga was \n\nsimilar to A. intermedius in this river, with the latter species having a karyotypic \n\n\n\n2\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nformula of 6m+8sm+4st+32t and heterochromatin in many pericentromeric \n\nregions. No GC or AT positive heterochromatin was found in either species and \n\nthe heterochromatin did not hybridize with the As51 satellite DNA probes, a \n\nrarity in fish. These data indicate that A. giton and A. intermedius belong to a \n\ndifferent clade than A. scabripinnis and A. parahybae, which is supported by a \n\n5S metacentric marker pair observed in the latter two species but not in the \n\nformer [4,6,7]. \n\nAstyanax fasciatus was described by Cuvier in 1819 with Brazil as its \n\ntype locality. This species is widely distributed, ranging from the Rio Negro in \n\nPatagonia to Mexico and southern Texas [3,8,9]. Different localities have more \n\nor less distinct varieties of A. fasciatus. These varieties are often only \n\ndifferentiated statistically; i.e., individuals are impossible to distinguish but a \n\nlarge number of specimens may be distinguished from those of another locality. \n\nAstyanax fasciatus is absent from some rivers where it has probably taken on \n\ndistinct forms, such as in the Para\u00edba do Sul River. In this river it is replaced by \n\nthe similar A. parahybae, which Eigenmann considered a distinct form of A. \n\nfasciatus formed by river isolation. This is the result of species isolation in rivers \n\nindependently emptying into the Atlantic in eastern and southeastern Brazil, \n\nCentral America and Mexico.  \n\nAstyanax fasciatus is characterized morphologically by a depth of caudal \n\npeduncle more than half the length of the head. It usually has a single tooth in \n\nthe maxillary. The depth is 2.3 to 3. Scales below the lateral line are in parallel \n\nseries. The caudal band is simple and median [3]. In the Tr\u00eas Marias River, A. \n\nfasciatus present an anal fin with 22 to 32 rays, a lateral line with 37 to 41 \n\nscales, with seven or eight above and 5.5 to 6.5 below, a length of 2.6 to 3.2 \n\ntimes its height, and one maxillary tooth [10]. \n\nAstyanax fasciatus is considered a species complex based on \n\nmorphological differentiation among basins and karyotypical diversity [11-16]. \n\nSeveral chromosome polymorphisms have been observed in A. fasciatus, with \n\nfundamental numbers ranging from 66 to 90 [13,17]. Multiple cytotypes have \n\nbeen observed in the same location, as in the Mogi-Gua\u00e7u River, which contains \n\n\n\n3\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nthree variants in sympatry, providing further evidence for considering A. \n\nfasciatus as a species complex [13]. Chromosomal inversions favor speciation, \n\nespecially over sites of geographical co-occurrence [9].  \n\nDiverse cytotypes, including 2n=45, 2n=46, 2n=47, 2n=48 and 2n=50, \n\nhave been found in sympatry [15]. In a study of A. fasciatus in the \u00c1gua da \n\nMadalena stream, Botucatu, S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil, three karyomorphs \n\n(2n=46, 2n=48 and 2n=50) were found in sympatry. Based on the absence of \n\nintermediate chromosome numbers, the restriction of B chromosomes to the \n\n2n=46 karyomorph and the absence of heteromorphism for the 18S rDNA sites, \n\nthese karyomorphs are unlikely to hybridize and are considered three separate \n\nspecies [15]. Diploid numbers for A. fasciatus are highly variable across streams \n\nand basins.  \n\n Astyanax fasciatus has diploid numbers of 2n=45, 46, 47 or 48, \n\nsometimes in sympatry, in the Rio Grande do Sul Basin [13,16]. However, \n\npopulations of this fish in the Upper Tibagi River may present karyotypes of \n\n6m+18sm+14s+10t (2n=48) or 8+18sm+14st+10t (2n=50), as well as \n\nheterochromative variations within the same karyotype [14]. Cytotypes without \n\ngene flow can be considered distinct taxonomic units, even in sympatry. \n\nThe 2n=46 cytotype is present in other river systems as well, including \n\nthe Araguari River in Uberl\u00e2ndia, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Here, specimens of \n\nA. fasciatus presented a karyotype of 14m+16sm+10st+6t (FN=86) with Ag-\n\nNORs in the terminal region of the short arm in the first submetacentric \n\nchromosome pair and in the short arms of the third metacentric pair [18]. \n\nPopulations of A. fasciatus of the Tibagi River showed variable Ag-NOR \n\nsites, with one cytotype having 2-3 and the other 1-3. The Ag-NOR sites show \n\nevidence of transposition, fission, deletion, translocation and inactivation, and \n\nthe presence of multiple NORs could indicate a plesiomorphy within this genus. \n\nDifferences in the karyotypes, constitutional heterogeneity, and 18S/5S sites do \n\nnot seem to represent fitness or selective adaptation in Astyanax [19]. \n\n Histone genes constitute a complex multigene family with a variable \n\nnumber of copies in one or more chromosome regions [11,20]. The H1 linker \n\n\n\n4\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nhistone genes located in the pericentromeric regions of two chromosomes in A. \n\nfasciatus were identical to those in A. altiparanae and A. bockmanni, indicating \n\nthese are a conserved feature of this genus. Astyanax fasciatus also presented \n\nclusters of 5S rDNA on one telocentric pair, a trait also found in A. bockmanni \n\nbut not A. altiparanae. The 5S and H1 genes co-localized on chromosome 3 and \n\n5S hybridization revealed clusters in the pericentromeric regions of chromosome \n\n23 [11]. \n\nPopulations of Astyanax fasciatus in the Upper Paran\u00e1, Araguaia-\n\nTocantins, Contas and S\u00e3o Francisco basins present multiple karyotypes in \n\nsympatry, reviewed in [15]. In the \u00c1gua da Madalana Stream, Botucatu, S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo Brazil, a population of A. fasciatus included a 2n=46 cytotype (FN=84, \n\n5m+8sm+6st+4a), a 2n=48 cytotype (FN=86, 5m+8sm+6st+4a) and a 2n=50 \n\ncytotype (FN=84, 5m+8sm+4st+8a). All contain similar constitutive \n\nheterochromatin and occur in sympatry, with no differences between males and \n\nfemales.  \n\nThe cytotypes may be differentiated by morphology using canonical \n\nvariate analysis, indicating the variants may be the result of gene flow or recent \n\nisolation. Karyotype morphology of the 2n=48 cytotype was different at Furnas 2 \n\nof the Vila Velha State Park in Paran\u00e1 State, which is separated from other \n\nbodies of water and prohibits gene flow. The 2n=48 and 2n=50 cytotypes \n\ncontain heterochromatin mainly distributed as very conspicuous blocks in the \n\ntelomeric regions of the long arms of the telocentric chromosomes. One 2n=49 \n\nindividual was found, with seven metacentric chromosomes and \n\nheterochromatin equal to the 48 and 50 cytotypes -- possibly a rare hybrid. A \n\ndistinct 2n=50 cytotype in this region presented only a few chromosomes with \n\nheterochromatin, almost always located interstitially [14]. \n\n In A. fasciatus from the Upper Paran\u00e1, NORs are present in the distal \n\nportions of the short arms of two submetacentric chromosomes. 5S markers \n\nwere present in the pericentric region of two metacentric and two telocentric \n\nchromosomes, with 28S markers present in the distal portion of the short arm of \n\n\n\n5\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ntwo submetacentric chromosomes, colocalized with 5S in the two metacentric \n\nand telocentric chromosomes [7].  \n\n In the Mogi-Gua\u00e7u river, the headwaters (at Ouro-Fino) contain A. \n\nfasciatus with diploid numbers of 2n=48 and 2n=47; in the middle region \n\n(Cachoeira de Emas, Pirassununga) they have diploid numbers of 2n=48, \n\n2n=46, 2n=45, 2n=47 and 2n=46 but with different chromosome morphology; \n\nand near the confluence of the Mogi-Gua\u00e7u with the Pardo River (Barrisha), \n\n2n=46 and 2n=48 [13]. NOR, 18S and 5S markers were conserved within all \n\ncytotypes. The 2n=45 cytotype is likely the result of centric fusion among \n\ntelocentric chromosomes as no 2n=44 cytotype has been found. At Emas Falls, \n\nin the middle of the Mogi-Gua\u00e7u River (where fish cannot go upstream), most A. \n\nfasciatus are 2n=46 with few 2n=48 and chromosomal variants [9]. \n\n This scenario is reversed at localities upstream (Ouro Fino, all 2n=48) \n\nand downstream (Barrinha, most 2n=48). Some specimens from the Tiet\u00ea River \n\nmay have invaded the Mogi-Gua\u00e7u at a certain point between Emas falls and \n\nBarrinha, possibly through floods that temporarily connected tributaries from \n\neach main river, or by human activities. An occasional hybrid of 2n=48 and \n\n2n=50 is found in the Tibagi River, a tributary of Paranapanema [9]. \n\n NORs are variable between cytotypes in the Mogi-Gua\u00e7u, ranging from \n\ntwo (most common) to eight with FISH 18S markers located in the NORs. Other \n\nfluorescent markings were smaller, always telomeric and located in \n\nsubtelocentric and telocentric chromosomes, although more difficult to see and \n\nnot detectable in all specimens. All cytotypes have a ribosomal site on the \n\nsubterminal region of the short arm of one submetacentric pair and 5S markings \n\nin the pericentromeric region of the short arms of one telocentric pair [13]. These \n\nmarkings indicate the proximity of the cytotypes and a recent divergence[13]. \n\nThe 2n=46 cytotype has six variations, likely the result of random interbreeding \n\nbetween cytotypes, i.e. karyotype plasticity. Although differences in karyotype \n\nmay cause reproductive isolation, this is not the case in this river [21]. \n\n These chromosome combinations are not enough to adversely affect \n\nfitness, as evidenced by marker chromosomes from several 2n=48 variants. It is \n\n\n\n6\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\npossible that Cachoeira de Emas contains populations that converged during \n\nmigrations. 2n=46 could have come from the Paran\u00e1 River, through either the \n\nTiet\u00ea or Grande rivers, or small floods in areas where the Tiet\u00ea and Mogi-Gua\u00e7u \n\nrivers are close[13]. \n\n If 2n=46 is an invading karyotype, the ability to interbreed may be helping \n\nit succeed [13]. Shared features of the karyotypes suggest recent divergence, \n\nsuggesting two populations or two species [19]. Chromosomal speciation may \n\ncause reproductive isolation because hybrids may be infertile, although that \n\ndoes not appear to be the case in this river[13]. The 2n=46 invader is likely able \n\nto interbreed with 2n=48, as indicated by the frequency and location of 2n=46 \n\ncytotypes in nearby Paran\u00e1 Basin collection sites and constitutive \n\nheterochromatin in terminal regions on long arms of variouschromosomes and in \n\nthe terminal regions of the short arms of submetacentric chromosomes in both \n\ncytotypes, with these regions being GC-rich and containing NORs [16]. \n\n Banding patterns differ among Astyanax. C-banding is highly variable, \n\nwith polymorphisms occurring even within populations. GC-rich heterochromatic \n\nregions are often associated with NORs [9]. Fifty nine percent AT satellite DNA \n\nwas identified in a portion of the A. scabripinnis genome [22] containing \n\nmonomeric units of 51 bp, known as As51 [23]. This sequence has also been \n\nidentified in A. fasciatus, A. janeiroensis and A. paranae. Although satellites are \n\nlikely targets for breaks and fusions, As51 has not been associated with \n\nmodifications to the diploid number in A. fasciatus or A. scabripinnis [23]. \n\n Nevertheless, hybrid forms have not been directly detected in the Mogi-\n\nGua\u00e7u Basin, although molecular markers show some gene flow among \n\ncytotypes [19]. As51 satellite sites have been found in the terminal regions of the \n\nlong arms of one telocentric, four subtelocentric and three submetacentric pairs \n\nin the 2n=48 cytotype, and in one telocentric, three subtelocentric and four \n\nsubmetacentric pairs in the 2n=46 cytotype, with additional As51 sites in the \n\nvariant pairs. CMA3 staining showed GC-rich heterochromatin exclusively \n\nrelated to the NOR sites [16]. \n\n\n\n7\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n Several species of Astyanax including A. altiparanae, A. lacustris, A. \n\nfasciatus, A. schubarti and A. scabripinnis show conserved localization of \n\n5S/28S markers between species, indicating a close phylogenetic relationship \n\n[7], with 5S visible in more than one pair [24]. NORs are almost always fewer \n\nthan regions detected by FISH. These 5S locations are absent in A. giton and A. \n\nintermedius, suggesting polyphyly or divergence within this genus [13]. R-\n\nbanding patterns have been observed in four species (A. altiparanae, A. \n\nfasciatus, A. schubarti and A. scabripinnis) in one large submetacentric \n\nchromosome and one small pair of metacentric chromosomes, colocalized with \n\nC-band negative late replicating regions [7]. \n\n In Astyanax, heterochromatin may be balanced between AT and GC \n\ncontent [6] or 59% AT [22]. Astyanax fasciatus and A. parahybae have As51 \n\nDNA, while A. giton and A. intermedius do not. Both the 2n=46 and 2n=58 forms \n\nof A. fasciatus have 8 pairs of As51, which is similar to that of A. scabripinnis \n\nfrom the Piracicaba River [12,16]. It is possible that As51 was the ancestral \n\ncondition and that the pairs have increased with time as a result of Robertsonian \n\nand non-Robertsonian rearrangements that could duplicate or disperse satellite \n\nDNA. Most As51 sites are homologous, but slight variations exist. Variations \n\nbetween karyotypes could be the result of intrachromosomal rearrangements \n\ninvolving telocentric chromosomes with terminal As51 sites on the long arms, \n\nwhich were absent in the 2n=45 forms [16]. \n\n Not all regions where 28S rDNA colocalized with 5S rDNA were Ag+, \n\npossibly because the 5S genes were associated with rDNA genes that did not \n\nform a nucleolus because the gene sequences were too small to be detected \n\n[7]. In A. fasciatus from the Upper Paran\u00e1, co-localization was observed in one \n\nof the telocentric pairs [24]. 5S rDNA is composed of tandemly repeated units of \n\napprox 120 bp, intercalated by a non-transcribed spacer (nts). The 120 bp \n\nrepeated units are stable, while the nts changes more rapidly [4]. Several \n\nspecies of Astyanax, including A. fasciatus, have a 5S rDNA cluster in the distal \n\nregion of a metacentric chromosome [4,7]. \n\n\n\n8\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n B-chromosomes are dispensable supernumerary chromosomes \n\ncharacterized by their lack of homology with regular ones [20] and do not obey \n\nMendelian laws of inheritance [25]. B chromosomes are mostly composed of \n\nrepetitive DNA sequences, especially ribosomal DNA, satellite DNA and in rare \n\ncases, protein coding genes [11]. It is estimated B chromosomes are present in \n\n10-15% of eukaryotes [25] but this is impossible to determine with certainty as \n\nby definition they are not found in all individuals and are likely to be missed if the \n\nkaryotype is based on only one individual [26].  \n\n B chromsomes can vary substantially in their size, frequency and other \n\ncharacteristics. They may be macro, intermediate or micro and most are \n\nheterochromatic. Many Bs contain rRNA genes detectable by both NOR and \n\nFISH [25]. B chromosomes may originate in one of two ways. They can be \n\nintraspecific, from the host genome (most common) or interspecific, from \n\nanother species, .e.g. the result of hybridization [27]. As B chromosomes do not \n\nsynapse or recombine, they evolve independently of the A set. Therefore, \n\nregardless of origin, the evolutionary pathways of B chromosomes are the same \n\nin either case and B chromosome morphology is not necessarily reflective of \n\norigin. \n\n There are several ways to test B chromosome origins. Banding patterns \n\nand repetitive sequences may be compared between the B and A sets. If no \n\nmatches are found, the B chromosome can be compared to the a set of related \n\nspecies. Chromosomal fragments may also be visible in interspecific crosses, \n\nand phylogenetic analyses may be done on the transposable elements of both \n\nthe B and A sets [27].  \n\n The simplest method for B chromosomes to originate is for them to come \n\nfrom the A set via duplication or fragments after fusions or amplification of a \n\nparacentromeric region. Fragments of paternal chromosomes sometimes \n\nsurvive even in cytoplasmic incompatible crosses [27]. That similar B \n\nchromosomes are found in similar species suggests they are long lived and may \n\neven survive speciation events -- or they could be the result of more recent \n\nhybridization events [25,27]. \n\n\n\n9\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n B chromosomes in Astyanax can vary within species (by size or \n\nmorphology). They may also vary by sex or altitude, meaning may be an \n\nadaptive trait [9]. There is no evidence on the precise role of B chromosomes on \n\nindividual fitness in Astyanax[9]. Species of Astyanax, such as A. fasciatus, A. \n\nscabripinnis and A. schubarti present B-chromosomes [28,29]. The origin of \n\nsupernumerary chromosomes is unknown, but it is accepted that they result \n\nfrom amplification of other parts of the genome [30] and A-chromosomes follow \n\ntheir own evolutionary pathway (Mestriner, 2000). The metacentric macro B \n\nchromosome is the most common in Astyanax[11].  \n\n In A. fasciatus, B chromosomes are reported for the 2n=46 karyomorph \n\nin the S\u00e3o Francisco Basin [15,31,32] and a 2n=49 karyomorph has been \n\nobserved in the Tibagi River, in the Upper Paran\u00e1 River Basin, Ponta Grossa, \n\nParan\u00e1, Brazil [14].  \n\n There are two groups of B chromosomes in Astyanax. The first is \n\ncomposed of species with large metacentric Bs, including A. fasciatus, A. \n\nscabripinnis[32-36], A. eigenmanniorum, A. schubarti, and A. bockmanni[32], \n\nsuggesting a common origin. This hypothesis could be tested by comparing \n\nDNA sequences of B chromosomes. The second is in the A. scabripinnis group, \n\nwhere the presence of distinct types of supernumerary chromosomes has been \n\ncommonly reported in several populations ranging from large \n\nmetacentric/submetacentric elements to small metacentric or even \n\nmicrochromosomes [9]. \n\nB chromosomes may result from interspecific hybridization, supported by \n\nthe presence of DNA sequences in the B chromosome matching those of the A \n\nchromosome of related species, as seen in A. fasciatus[37].  However, an \n\nancestral B preceding speciation events is supported by As51 satellite DNA \n\nfound in B chromosomes of A. scabripinnis populations. [9]. The B chromosome \n\nmay originate from a nondisjunction of the first pair of chromosomes during \n\nmeiosis, with subsequent heterochromatinization [29]. Another hypothesis is that \n\nshared DNA sequences on A and B chromosomes evidence that the B \n\nchromosomes are isochromes from the A set [22], which was confirmed in A. \n\n\n\n10\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nscabripinnis by finding that B chromosomes resulted from tandem duplications \n\nof heterochromatin segments in acrocentric pair 24, as well as sharing some \n\nrepetitive DNA sequences [36,37]. This is based on the presence of an \n\ninterstitial heterochromatic band in the long arm of this pair, which is believed to \n\ncause interstitial As51 sites at symmetric distances from the centromere in both \n\narms of the B chromosome. B chromosomes may also vary by gender, with \n\nindividual females or some populations containing an additional B [22]. A large \n\nmetacentric B chromosome was found in A. scabripinnis, A. eigenmanniorum, A. \n\nschubarti and A. fasciatus[32,37]. This suggests that this B originated prior to \n\nspecies differentiation, but molecular analysis is needed to confirm. B \n\nchromosomes have not been documented in A. giton. No phenotypic effects \n\nresulting from B chromosomes have been observed in Astyanax [37]. \n\n As in the second hypothesis, rapid heterochromatization may occur by \n\ngenetic imprinting to deactivate B chromosomes, which explains the presence of \n\nheterochromatin in many Bs. Sometimes the B forms anew in each generation \n\ndue to non-disjunction [27]. Rapid heterochromatization of B chromosomes often \n\noccurs (as seen by C-Banding) and may be necessary for stability and positive \n\nselection. B chromosomes may also be a precursor to sex chromosomes \n\n(especially the y chromosomes, which also move to opposite poles during \n\nspermatogenesis) which are also high in repeats [25,27]. B chromosomes may \n\noriginate from either autosomes or sex chromosomes, although the latter are not \n\nfound in any populations of A. fasciatus or A. giton.  \n\n B chromosomes often contain rDNA to encode ribosomal RNAs, typically \n\nvisualized as NORs (secondary constrictions). NORs may also be suspect to \n\nchromosome breakage, which could create Bs that could then lose rDNA \n\nsegments, affecting their size. Bs may also accumulate fragments from various \n\nsources [27]. \n\n Bs may have no phenotypic effects, or they may affect vigor, fertility or \n\nfecundity. For example, B chromosomes result in color changes in some plants \n\n[25]. Bs may also exert influence simply by their presence, e.g. by containing \n\nNORs. [27].One negative effect of Bs is that having more chromosomes means \n\n\n\n11\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nmore DNA to replicate, meaning a longer cell cycle and larger cells. This slows \n\ndevelopment in some species. Bs may be more common in species with smaller \n\ngenomes and fewer chromosomes [25].  \n\n B tolerance is dependent on the effects of supernumerary chromosomes. \n\nIf fitness decreases with Bs, complete intolerance results. If fitness is unaffected \n\nwith some B chromosomes, but is reduced when more are present, there will be \n\nincomplete tolerance (the most common case). If fitness is independent of Bs, \n\nthe A set will be tolerant. Overtolerance occurs when the B increases host \n\nfitness. This last case is most likely when the B arises from hybridization as it \n\nincludes new DNA. As the effects of B chromosomes are usually negative, they \n\nmay be more common in favorable environments with less selective pressure \n\n[25]. \n\n Methylation has been proposed for deactivating sex chromosomes and \n\nmay also function with late-replicating B chromosomes to make them genetically \n\ninert [27]. B chromosomes that are transcriptionally active with no apparent \n\nphenotypic effects could have their transcripts nullified by transporon insertion. \n\n Meiosis is always asymmetric, especially in females with polar bodies and \n\noocytes [25]. Since Bs are not paired during meiosis, they can go to their \n\npreferred meiotic pole, possibly increasing their transmission rate. Bs may also \n\nresult from nondisjunction during meiosis anaphase. Bs are often unstable \n\nduring meiosis, with a transmission rate of less than 0.5. A rate of greater than \n\n0.5 indicates accumulation, or drive. B drive is a disregard for Mendelian \n\ntransmission (also known as an unfair transmission pattern) and is necessary for \n\ntheir survival. B chromosomes must have accumulation methods, or they would \n\nonly make sense as being beneficial; they likely begin by being selfish even if \n\nthey become inactive later [25]. Due to meiosis, it is possible for the B to always \n\noriginate from one sex. They can occur during female meiosis by migrating from \n\none oocyte to another, as well as in males by avoiding heterochromatin [27]. \n\n Bs may be considered parasitic if they have driven or damage the host \n\n(virulence). In species in which the B chromosomes do not drive, they could be \n\nsuppressed by the A genome. The host (A set) may evolve resistance, but the B \n\n\n\n12\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nmay evolve another form, continuing the cycle. For example, in species of mealy \n\nbugs the B tries to decondense and segregate with the sperm, but drive \n\nsuppressor genes in the A set prevent this from occurring. The selection to \n\neliminate B chromosomes, however, is usually weak. Genes for their removal \n\nare only helpful to individuals with them, and in most cases the B has very small \n\neffects. On the other hand, the B is selecting for its very survival [25]. \n\n Bs are selected at the level of the chromosome and impact higher levels \n\nof organization [25]. They can affect gene expression of the A set, NOR \n\nexpression and the level of recombination in the A set (chiasma effect). The \n\nlatter is hypothesized to occur for one of four reasons: \n\n1) The adaptation hypothesis: B chromosomes enable higher levels of \n\ngenetic variation, leading to faster population evolution. This is criticized \n\nbecause it suggests parasites are selected for positive host effects. \n\n2) Passive effects: Chiasma effects are the result of extra DNA, but this \n\ncannot explain contradictory effects. \n\n3) The increased chiasma frequency is the result of parasitic Bs, because \n\nsome recombinant progeny will be resistant to B chromosomes and \n\nindividuals with Bs will have higher rates of recombination. (This is a \n\nvariation of Matt Ridley\u2019s Red Queen hypothesis [38], that recombination \n\nincreases when conditions are poor.) \n\n4) Changes in chiasma frequency serve the selfish purposes of the B \n\nchromosome, i.e. Bs pair with Bs to reduce meiotic loss with the side \n\neffect of more B chiasma, or the formation of bivalent Bs is blocked, or \n\nChiasma results from restricted A-B pairing. \n\n When chiasma increases in populations with driving Bs, the third \n\nexplanation is most likely. The response is proportional to the intensity of B \n\nparasitic Bs, and contradictory results could indicate the B is not driving (near-\n\nneutral). Where chiasma decreases, it could be that Bs are heterotic or \n\nbeneficial. In populations with even numbers of B chromosomes, it may be \n\nbecause the B chromosomes are able to pair (hypothesis 4). If odd and even \n\n\n\n13\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nnumbers of Bs are present in different ratios, one may have more drive than the \n\nother [25].  \n\n Many B chromosomes are stable, in which the drive mechanism and \n\nselection are balanced. In these cases, the B becomes more dependent on drift \n\nand population size, unless it can acquire an even number of Bs and regular \n\nmeiotic behavior to incorporate itself into the A set [25]. B equilibrium (stability) \n\nresults from two opposing forces: first, the accumulation of Bs by either the \n\nselfish chromosome theory or a high transmission ratio; and a change in \n\nindividual fitness. As the survival of B chromosomes is ultimately linked to their \n\nhosts, they may become less harmful over time (which would reduce the \n\nprobability of phenotypic effects) [25]. Newly formed Bs would therefore be \n\nexpected to be the most harmful. \n\n B chromosomes have three options -- they can remain as a parasite, they \n\ncan acquire a function and integrate themselves into the host (the selfish gene, \n\nworking horizontally; although this is rare and only possible when already \n\ncommon) or go extinct. They may change from parasitic to neutral and back \n\nmany times. The A set may completely suppress drive, or do nothing. But the B \n\nhas a secret weapon -- because it is genetically indispensible, it can support a \n\nhigh mutation rate without serious consequences, which explains the large \n\nnumber of B variants in many species. Even a neutralized B can still last more \n\nthan 10,000 generations, plenty of time to regain drive/parasitism [25]. \n\nAccording to Muller's ratchet, deleterious mutations build up in asexual species, \n\nso sexual reproduction is needed to eliminate them. As B chromosomes are not \n\nsubject to recombination, they may also be subject to these mutations [27]. \n\n B chromosomes may in some cases be considered genomic parasites \n\n[26], as in the selfish gene theory [39]. This has been theorized for populations \n\nof A. scabripinnis with B chromosomes at high altitude but not at lower elevation \n\n[40]. Under this explanation, more B chromosomes would be expected in areas \n\nwhere environmental conditions are more favorable for this species -- e.g. \n\nheadwater streams, higher altitude, etc., where decreased predation and \n\ninterspecific competition allow higher tolerance of parasitic B chromosomes [37]. \n\n\n\n14\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nIn populations of A. scabripinnis, populations at the highest altitudes were the \n\nmost likely to have large metacentric B chromosomes [24], but they had fewer \n\nNORs than low altitude populations [37].  \n\nC-Banding has shown that B chromosomes can be totally or partially \n\nheterochromatic [28]. Some Astyanax populations show faint paracentromeric \n\nC-bands in all chromosomes, being more conspicuous distally on the long arms \n\nof telocentric A chromosomes [22]. Additionally, C-band locations may coincide \n\nwith those of NOR, and interstitial C-bands are sometimes present on the arms \n\nof B chromosomes.  \n\nAstyanax fasciatus from the Campo Novo River, Paran\u00e1 Basin, S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo State, Brazil (22\u00ba23\u20198.35\u201dS, 49\u00ba0\u201955.63\u201dW) presented a diploid number of \n\n2n=46, karyotype of 10m+14st+20st+2t and FN=90 [11]. These authors suggest \n\nthat the 2n=46 A. fasciatus are probably the result of fusions from the ancestral \n\nstate of 2n=50. Two out of 25 individuals had medium-sized telocentric B \n\nchromosomes of similar size and morphology to pair 23, but it is unlikely that \n\nthey originated from the A set because they do not have similar rDNA or \n\nhisDNA. \n\nAstyanaxbimaculatus, A. fasciatus, A. schubarti, and A. scabripinnis \n\nsubjected to R-Banding showed one large submetacentric and two small \n\nsubmetacentric markers, indicating a common origin among them [7,8]. R- and \n\nG-banding of a population of A. scabripinnis paranae (now known as A. \n\nparanae, separate from the A. scabripinnis complex [41]) from Cascatinha \n\nstream showed a pattern of longitudinal differentiation in B chromosomes [29]. \n\nSilver nitrate (Ag-NOR banding) can identify the 45S rDNA located in the \n\nNORs, however the 5S rDNA sites require more specific techniques, e.g. \n\nfluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) [24]. Intrapopulational NOR site variation \n\nmay represent genomic variations in populations with stable karyotypes [24].  \n\nAstyanax spp. are found in two reservoirs of the S\u00e3o Bartolomeu Creek at \n\nthe Federal University of Vi\u00e7osa in Minas Gerais State, Brazil, and have never \n\nbeen formally identified. We hypothesize that they are A. giton and A. fasciatus, \n\nknown respectively as the silver minnow and red-tailed minnow. These species \n\n\n\n15\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nshow cytogenetic variance across basins and each may constitute a separate \n\nspecies complex. This hypothesis may be tested by cytogenetic characters and \n\nmorphology.  \n\nDam construction, flow regulation, mining, deforestation and industrial and \n\nagricultural pollution increasingly affect major river basins by modifying fish \n\nhabitats and altering fish life-cycles. However, compared to mammals, birds and \n\namphibians, relatively few South American freshwater fish have been \n\nscientifically assessed as endangered species by IUCN or other criteria, even \n\n[42]. \n\nCytogenetic studies, combined with mitochondrial DNA and morphology, will \n\nfacilitate characterization of these species within Astyanax. Cytogenetic studies \n\nof chromosomal data, including karyotyping, C-Banding, Ag-NOR and the FISH \n\ntechnique will be performed. Cytogenetic studies can show if these individuals \n\nrepresent populations of A. giton and A. fasciatus, and can be used for \n\ninterpopulational cytogenetic comparisons to provide information on evolutionary \n\nstructure of this genus. \n\n\n\n16\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n1. INTRODUCTION \n\nNeotropical freshwater fish comprise approximately 6,000 of the 13,000 \n\nspecies worldwide, in 25 orders and 71 families [9]. These fishes represent the \n\nmost diversified vertebrate group and are adequate for studies of genetic \n\ndiversity and evolution [43].  \n\nNeotropical fishes present high karyotypic variability, with changes in the \n\ndiploid number, sex chromosome systems, supernumerary chromosomes, \n\nnatural triploidy, and diversity of constitutive heterochromatin and nucleolar \n\norganizer regions (NORs) [44]. Some families of Neotropical fish are \n\ncharacterized by stable diploid numbers, such as Anostomidae (including the \n\ngenera Abramites, Anostomus, Laemolyta, Leporellus, Leporinus, Pseudanos, \n\nRhytiodus and Schizodon), Prochilodontidae, (including Prochilodus and \n\nSemaprochilodus), Parodontidae (including Apareiodon and Parodon), \n\nCurimatidae (including Curimata, Curimatella, Curimatopsis and Cyphocharax), \n\nCynodontidae (including Cynodon, Hydrolycus and Rhaphydon), Hemiodontidae \n\n(including Anodus, Argonectes, Bivibranchia and Hemiodus) and \n\nPseudopimelodidae (including Lophiosilurus, Microglanis and \n\nPseudopimelodus), all of which present 2n=54 (excluding rare instances of B \n\nchromosomes) [45]. \n\n In other cases, the diploid numbers may be more variable. In the family \n\nErythrinidae, Hoplias lacerdae presents a conservation of the diploid number \n\n2n=50 in the Usina Limoeira (S\u00e3o Jose do Rio Pardo) and CA UNESP (both in \n\nS\u00e3o Paulo State), in the Rio S\u00e3o Francisco and Uberl\u00e2ndia (Minas Gerais State) \n\nand the Rio Pitinga (Amazonas). This diploid number is also found in H. aff. \n\nlacerdae in the Rio Grande (Sacramento, Minas Gerais). On the other hand, H. \n\nmalabaricus is variable, presenting 2n=40 (males 39) in specimens from the \n\nMonjolinho, Piracicaba, Tr\u00eas Pontes, Passa-Cinco, Luiz Ant\u00f4nio, Tiet\u00ea and Lobo \n\nrivers, (S\u00e3o Paulo); Rio das Pedras (Minas Gerais) and 2n=40 (both sexes) in \n\nthe Rio S\u00e3o Francisco (Minas Gerais), Manaus (Amazonas), Tucurul (Par\u00e1), \n\nPorto Velho (Rond\u00f4nia), Cuiaba Pontal do Araguaia Rio Sepotuba (Mato \n\n\n\n17\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nGrosso); Goi\u00e1s Velho (Goi\u00e1s), Corumba and Miranda (Mato Grosso do Sul), \n\nParamaribo (Suriname) and the Rio Aguapey in Argentina. This last location \n\nalso includes 2n=42 cytotypes, as do the Doce River, Lake Car\u00edoca (of the Doce \n\nRiver), Lake Patos, Rio Grande, Rio Piranga and Rio Sapucal (all located in \n\nMinas Gerais); Rio Juqui\u00e1, Rio Jurumir\u00edm and Lake Guapor\u00e9 (S\u00e3o Paulo); Rio \n\nVor\u00e1, S\u00e3o Mateus do Sul, Curitiba, Rio Jurumir\u00edm, Rio Igua\u00e7u and Rio Tibagi \n\n(Paran\u00e1) and Araguaiana (Mato Grosso) [45]. In total, seven cytotypes have \n\nbeen found for H. malabaricus [46]. \n\nThe Characiformes are one of the main orders of Ostariophysan fishes, \n\nincluding approximately 1,900 valid species belonging to over 270 genera, \n\ncurrently arranged in 18 families in Africa, Central America and South America \n\n[47,48].It is one of the most numerous freshwater fish fauna in the Neotropical \n\nregion, second only to catfish [49]. Phylogenetic relationships within \n\nCharaciformes are not clear [50].  \n\nCharacidae is the most diverse family and comprises 58% of this order, \n\nwith approximately 250 South American genera and 1,100 species, \n\n[8,37,48,51,52]. It comprises the majority of freshwater fish in Brazil, with 20 \n\nsubfamilies and approximately 400 species [10,37]. Phylogenetic relationships \n\nof Characidae, however, are not known (but see [21]). Genera of this family \n\nhave variable diploid numbers, with 2n=52 in Bryconamericus, Cheirodon, \n\nExodon, Inpaichthys, Markiana, Piabina, Triportheus, Charax, Cynopotamus, \n\nGaleocharax, Roeboides, Odontostilbe, Serrapinus and Mimagoniates; 48 in \n\nBryconops; 50 in Ctenobrycon, Hasemania, Hollandichthys, Moenkhausia, \n\nNematobrycon, Pselogrammus, Salminus, Aphyocharacinae, Brycon, \n\nDeuterodon and Oligosarcus, the latter two closely related to Astyanax. Diploid \n\nnumbers of 60 or greater are found in Pristobrycon, Pygocentrus, Serrasalmus \n\nand Metynnis, while lower numbers are found in Phenacogaster (46) or \n\nParacheirodon, which presents 32, 36, 50 or 52 chromosomes [45].  \n\nMore specific trends are also evident in genera such as Astyanax, which \n\ncan vary in diploid numbers, chromosome morphology, banding patterns and the \n\npresence of B chromosomes, especially across species or basins. A diploid \n\n\n\n18\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nnumber of 2n=50 is considered basal for the genus [53] as found for A. \n\nbimaculatus, with most Astyanax containing between 2n=46 and 2n=50 \n\nchromosomes [7,15] except for A. schubarti which has 2n=36 [7,54]. \n\nThe genus Astyanax was described in 1854[55] based on samples \n\ncollected from Baird and Girard in Texas and Mexico. The original description \n\nlists the presence of an adipose fin, large scales, dorsal fin above the ventrals a \n\nnon-serrated abdominal line and a double row of teeth on both the upper and \n\nlower jaw, flattened with several conical spines or processes upon their edge, \n\nlacking canine and palative teeth. The double row of mandibular teeth is not \n\nreported in later descriptions of this genus. \n\nAstyanax was described again by Carl Eigenmann in 1917, with samples \n\nfrom South America[3]. Eigenmann characterized Astyanax as small \n\ncompressed fishes, more or less elongate, reaching a length of 150 mm and \n\nusually much smaller (with the exception being the larger Astyanax maximus). \n\nFishes of this genus have a complete lateral line, pre-maxillary teeth in two \n\nseries (internal series with four or usually five teeth), a mandible with strong \n\nfrontal teeth and minute conical teeth on the sides. The crowns of the \n\npremaxillary and mandibular are usually ridged and denticulate, with few or no \n\nteeth in the maxillary. Maxillary bone is short, with its anterior edge forming a \n\nmore or less continuous curve from end to end. The lateral line rarely has more \n\nthan 39 scales although it can be as high as 41 in some specimens of A. \n\nfasciatus, A. taeniatus and A. scabripinnis. The lateral line curves slightly in the \n\nfront, and runs along the fourth longitudinal series of scales, above the ventral \n\nfin or higher. The scales are of normal size and cover the base of the rays of the \n\ntail, although the rest of the tail is naked. Regular and complete series of scales \n\nare found between the occipital process and the dorsal. The gill rakers are \n\nsetiform and no predorsal spine is present. Body length is about three times \n\nbody height [3,10]. \n\n Some geographically isolated fish assemblages are restricted to \n\nheadwaters, separated by physical, chemical or biotic barriers, resulting in \n\ndistinct evolutionary pathways within a single hydrographic system. This may be \n\n\n\n19\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nthe reason Astyanax is one of the most speciose genera in the Neotropics, \n\nincluding several species complexes [9]. Astyanax is regarded as incertae sedis \n\nbecause of its likely polyphyletic origin [9] and considered a recent group with \n\nchromosome polymorphism in several species [21]. Astyanax has extensive \n\nmorphological diversification and highly complex taxonomy with a number of \n\nspecies complexes [15,37,52]. \n\n Although doubts remain on the monophyly of Astyanax[3,4,7,8,56], this \n\ngenus is an excellent model for all kinds of studies of evolutionary mechanisms \n\n[41]. It is one of the best documented Neotropical fish genera from a cytogenetic \n\nstandpoint, with the species complexes Astyanax scabripinnis, A. fasciatus and \n\nA. altiparanae (the latter is sometimes referred to as A. bimaculatus) being the \n\nmost studied [41]. Species complexes are characterized by wide cytogenetic \n\nvariation, mainly regarding distinct diploid numbers. Karyotypes, however, could \n\nalso differ because of non-Robertsonian rearrangements. Whether or not \n\nindividual cytotypes are considered distinct species depends on whether or not \n\nthey can hybridize (karyotype plasticity) [41]. Some examples of karyotypes are \n\nas follows: \n\n Astyanax scabripinnis from Rio Agua do Rancho, Paran\u00e1 present 2n=50, \n\n6m+28sm+16t, 4 NORs, C-Bands and 0-2 micro B chromosomes; A. \n\nbimaculatus from the Rio Paraguai, Mato Grosso do Sul present 2n=50, \n\n6m+26sm+12st+6t, 1 NOR, C-, Q- and Mytramicin Bands and no Bs; A. \n\naltiparanae from Fundo Altenas, Minas Gerais are 2n=50, 8m+28sm+6st+8t, 2 \n\nNORs, C-Banding, Chromomycin A3 and no Bs; A. aff. abramis from the Rio \n\nBento Gomes, Mato Grosso are 2n=50, 22m+10sm+6st+12t, 1 NOR, C-\n\nBanding, Chromomycin A3 and no Bs; A. eigenmanniorum from the Marrecas, \n\nParan\u00e1 are 2n=50, 6m+20sm+8st+16t, 5 NORs, C-Bands, Chromomycin A3 and \n\nno Bs; A. schubarti from the Rio Mogi-Gua\u00e7u, S\u00e3o Paulo are 2n=36, \n\n12m+16sm+4st+4t, 1 NOR, C-Bands and no Bs; and A. fasciatus from the Rio \n\nS\u00e3o Francisco, Minas Gerais are 2n=46, 6m+24sm+8st+8a, 4 NORs, C-Bands, \n\nand 0-1 large metacentric Bs [45]. \n\n\n\n20\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n Astyanax fasciatus has highly variable karyotype morphology [41], with \n\ntwo standard diploid numbers of 2n=46 and 2n=48 and some 2n=50 specimens \n\nwith affinities to the A. fasciatus group in the Tibagi River Basin [9]. Several \n\ncytotypes may occur in sympatry, as in the Mogi-Gua\u00e7u  River.The karyotype of \n\nAstyanax giton is also geographically variable although a diploid number of \n\n2n=50 is conserved. A comparison of Astyanax spp. cytotypes across basins is \n\nshown (Table 1). \n\n \n\nTable 1.

Data for \nAstyanax giton from Sossego from Aguiar [2], A. fasciatus from S\u00e3o Francisco \nfrom (UNESP) [45] and Astyanax aff.fasciatus and A. giton from S\u00e3o Bartolomeu \n(bold) from this work. \n \n In terms of morphology, Eigenmann [3] points out that \"the true A. \n\nscabripinnis shades through [A. intermedius] into A. taeniatus.... I think it would \n\nbe possible to arrange specimens of A. scabripinnis, A. intermedius and A. \n\ntaeniatus from the Para\u00edba into series in respect to any one character and get \n\ncomplete integrations.\" In Astyanax taeniatus, the teeth on the sides of the lower \n\njaw tend to become graduate, a condition leading to the distinguishing character \n\nof Deuterodon[3]. Astyanax taeniatus usually has three teeth in the front row of \n\nthe premaxillary, 19 to 24 rays in the anal fin, two maxillary teeth, 32 to 39 \n\nscales on the lateral line with 5 to 7 above and 4 or 5 below. The teeth of A. \n\nobscurus, A. taeniatus, A. giton and A. intermedius all share the common trait of \n\ngradually decreasing, unlike most other Astyanax (including A. fasciatus) which \n\nexhibit an abrupt reduction in size between the anterior and posterior dentary \n\nteeth [57]. \n\n Astyanax altiparanae isconsidered a species complex because of \n\nsignificant inter-populational karyotypic variation (similar to A. fasciatus and A. \n\n\n\n22\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nscabripinnis). karyotypic variation may be caused by structural rearrangements, \n\ne.g. pericentric inversions. This is observed in A. giton and A. intermedius, which \n\nare mainly differentiated cytogenetically by a paracentric inversion in the \n\nchromosomal pair beaing 5S rDNA [9]. \n\n Astyanax giton is found in the Para\u00edba do Sul River Basin and coastal \n\nstreams of Esp\u00edrito Santo and Rio de Janeiro States [1] and in the Doce River \n\nBasin in Minas Gerais State, Brazil [2]. Astyanax giton is characterized \n\nmorphologically by two or three teeth in the front row of the premaxillary, an anal \n\nfin with 23-24 rays, 34 scales on the lateral line with 5 above and four below as \n\nwell as a diffuse (sometimes absent) vertically elongate humeral spot crossing \n\nthe third scale of the lateral line [3].  \n\nPopulations morphologically similar to Astyanax fasciatus are distributed \n\nfrom the Rio Negro in Patagonia to Mexico and southern Texas [3,8]. Astyanax \n\nfasciatus is characterized morphologically by a single maxillary tooth, an anal fin \n\nwith 22 to 32 rays, a lateral line with 37 to 41 scales, with seven or eight above \n\nand 5.5 to 6.5 below, a length of 2.6 to 3.2 times its height, and one maxillary \n\ntooth [10]. Astyanax fasciatus is considered a species complex, based on \n\nmorphological differentiation among basins and karyotypical diversity [11-16]. \n\nDiploid numbers for A. fasciatus are highly variable across streams and basins. \n\nAstyanax fasciatus is absent from the Para\u00edba do Sul River in which it is \n\nreplaced by A. parahybae, which may be a distinct form of A. fasciatus resulting \n\nfrom rivers independently emptying into the Atlantic in eastern and southeastern \n\nBrazil, Central America and Mexico[3,58]. \n\nAlthough the southeastern region of Brazil is known for its high levels of \n\nendemism (these rivers are considered a biogeographical unit [59], with 95% of \n\nspecies being considered endemic [58], few species of Astyanax have been \n\nkaryotyped in this area. Samples of Astyanax were captured in two reservoirs of \n\nthe S\u00e3o Bartolomeu Creek, at the Federal University of Vi\u00e7osa in Minas Gerais \n\nState, Brazil. Cytogenetic characterization of these fishes was done using \n\nkaryotypes with Giemsa, Ag-NOR banding, C-Banding, and the FISH technique. \n\nThese data were complemented with morphological and molecular analyses. \n\n\n\n23\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n2.1 COLLECTION AREA \n Ninety-one individuals (32 A. giton and 59 A. fasciatus) were captured \n\nfrom two reservoirs of the S\u00e3o Bartolomeu Creek at the Federal University of \n\nVi\u00e7osa, in Vi\u00e7osa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil from October 2011 to July 2012. \n\nThe S\u00e3o Bartolomeu creek is part of the Doce River Basin, in southeast Brazil, \n\n(18\u00ba 45\u2019 and 21\u00ba 15\u2019 S and 39\u00ba55\u2019and 43\u00ba 45\u2019W). Fish were captured with rods \n\nfrom two reservoirs, one near the Quatro Pilastras (20\u00b045'32.81\"S \n\n45\u00b052'22.54\"W) hereafter referred to as reservoir 1, and a second upstream \n\ndam (20\u00b046'06.31\"S 42\u00b052'17.27\"W), hereafter referred to as reservoir 2 (Figure \n\n1). These reservoirs were selected because they are somewhat isolated and \n\nhave never been studied cytogenetically. They are located within the Atlantic \n\nRainforest, an area considered a biodiversity hotspot, with only 8% of original \n\nforest remaining [60]. \n\n Although fish can swim from Reservoir 2 to Reservoir 1 via a waterfall, \n\nthey cannot go in the opposite direction, suggesting the possibility of differences \n\nin species composition between these reservoirs. Fifty fish (23 A. giton and 27 \n\nA. fasciatus) were captured from Reservoir 1 and 41 fish (9 A. giton and 32 A. \n\nfasciatus) from Reservoir 2. One male A. giton was captured from Reservoir 1; \n\nthe other 31 were female. Thirteen male A. fasciatus were captured from \n\nReservoir 1 along with 14 females, and six males and 26 female A. fasciatus \n\nwere captured from Reservoir 2. Astyanax giton were more difficult to capture in \n\nboth reservoirs and circumstantial evidence indicates that this species actively \n\navoids gillnets. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n24\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n \nFigure 1. Collection areas within the Federal University of Vi\u00e7osa (UFV) in \nVi\u00e7osa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. a) Reservoir 1; b) Reservoir 2. Map \nadapted from Google Earth imagery. \n \n\nFish were kept in aquariums for cytogenetic analysis, fixed in 10% \n\nformalin for one week, transferred to 70% ethanol, deposited in the \n\nichthyological collection at the Jo\u00e3o Moojen Zoological Museum for \n\nmorphological studies or sent to Dr. Vinicius A. Bertaco at the University of Rio \n\nGrande Do Sul for taxonomic confirmation. \n\n \n\n2.2 MORPHOLOGICAL PROTOCOLS \nThe sex of each fish was determined by external sexual dimorphism, \n\nbased on presence (males) or absence (females) of anal fin hooks and later \n\n\n\n25\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nconfirmed by type of gonad. Morphometric data were analyzed [3,10,56] \n\nincluding the length and height of the fish, the aspect ratio (length/height), the \n\nnumber of rays in the anal fin, the number of scales on, above and below the \n\nlateral line, and the number of teeth in the dentary, maxillary and pre-maxillary. \n\nData were analyzed using the software program PAST v. 2.17b [61]. Data were \n\ntransformed using the option to remove size from distances in PAST with \n\nisometric Burnaby then plotted with principal component analysis (PCA) with a \n\ncorrelation matrix and disregarding groups. \n\nFor PCA, fish were separated by species and the following thirteen \n\nmorphological characters were used: 1) Total length, 2) Body height, 3) Aspect \n\nratio (length/height), 4) Scales above lateral line, 5) Scales below lateral line, 6) \n\nScales on lateral line, 7) Number of rays on anal fin, 8) Dentary teeth (center), 9) \n\nDentary teeth (side), 10) Maxillary teeth, 11) Number of teeth in the first \n\npremaxillary row, 12) Number of teeth in the second premaxillary row, and 13) \n\nNumber of teeth in the third premaxillary row. This last attribute was observed \n\nonly in a single female Astyanax aff.fasciatus from reservoir 1 containing a \n\nsingle tooth in the third row; the rest of the fish had only two rows as expected \n\nfor this genus. \n\n \n2.3 CYTOGENETIC PROTOCOL \n Cytogenetic analyses were carried out on 60 fish with specimens from \n\nboth reservoirs. Mitotic chromosomes were obtained from cell suspensions of \n\nthe anterior kidney, using the conventional air-drying method[62] after fish were \n\nanaesthetized with clove oil [63]. In addition to the standard Giemsa method, \n\nchromosomes were analyzed using silver nitrate staining [64] to visualize the \n\nnucleolar organizing regions (Ag-NOR), C-banding was used to detect C-\n\npositive heterochromatin [65] and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was \n\nperformed [66] using 28S and 5S DNA sequence probes.  \n\nAbout 30 metaphase spreads were analyzed per specimen (total 1700) to \n\ndetermine the diploid chromosome number and karyotypic structure. \n\nChromosomes were classified as metacentric (m), submetacentric (sm), \n\n\n\n26\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nsubtelocentric (st) or telocentric (t) according to centromeric index values [67] \n\nusing the program ImageJ 1.46. \n\n \n\n2.4 MOLECULAR DNA \n DNA extraction followed [68] on six specimens. Fragments of cytochrome \n\noxidase subunit I (COI) were amplified using primers L8524 (5'-AAY CCT GAR \n\nACT GAC CAT G-3') and H9236 (5'-GTT AGT GGT CAK GGG CTT GGR TC-3') \n\n[69]. Double-stranded DNA was synthesized in 50 ?l reactions containing 10 ?l \n\ndNTPs (1 mM), 5 ?l reaction buffer (200 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8?4, 500 mM KCl), 2 \n\n?l MgCl2 (50 mM), 2 ?l of each primer (10 mM), 0?5 ?l (2?5 U) Taq DNA \n\npolymerase (Phoneutria), 2 ?l template DNA (100 ng/?l) and 26?5 ?l H2O. \n\nPCR conditions were as follows: 94? C (2 min), five cycles of 94? C (45 s), 54? C \n\n(45 s) and 72? C (1?5 min) and 29 cycles of 94? C (45 s), 58 ? C (45 s) and 72 ? \n\nC (1?5 min). PCR products were purified using Qiaquick (Qiagen; \n\nwww.quiagen.com): 5 ?l of the purified PCR product were used in a 10 ?l cycle \n\nsequencing reaction using a rhodamine terminator cycle sequencing kit (PE \n\nApplied Biosystems; www.appliedbiosystems.com). Sequences were aligned \n\nusing MEGA 5.0 [70]. The model of molecular evolution that best fitted the data \n\nwas GTR+I+G chosen using MrModeltest 2.3 [71] and haplotype divergence \n\nwas estimated within and between haplogroups using this model. Phylogenetic \n\ntrees were constructed with Bayesian inference (MB) using MrBayes v. 3.2.1. \n\nx64 [72] with ten million Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) steps [73] with \n\n25% burn-in to produce posterior probabilities of nodes in the tree.

RESULTS \n\n3.1 MORPHOLOGY \n Astyanax giton was characterized by a total length 67.96 to 92.45 mm, \n\nheight 20.05 to 30 mm, 5 to 6.5 (one with 7) scales above the lateral line, 4 to 6 \n\n(one with 6.5) scales below the lateral line, 31 to 39 (most 33 to 38) scales on \n\nthe lateral line, 16 to 21 (most 18 to 21) rays on the anal fin, 4 (one with 3) to 5 \n\ncentral dentary teeth, 0 to 3 lateral dentary teeth, 0 to 2 teeth in the maxillary, 2 \n\nto 4 (one with 5) teeth in the first row of the premaxillary and 3 to 5 teeth in the \n\nsecond row of the premaxillary and a black vertically elongated humeral spot.  \n\n Astyanax aff. fasciatus was characterized by a length 70.7 to 116.9 mm, \n\nheight 19 to 34.1 mm, 6 to 7.5 (one with 8) scales above the lateral line, 5 to  6.5 \n\nscales below the lateral line, 35 to 40 scales on the lateral line, 16 to 24 (most \n\n18 to 24) rays on the anal fin, 3 to 5 central dentary teeth, 0 to 5 lateral dentary \n\nteeth, 0 to 2 teeth in the maxillary, 3 to 4 (one with 5) teeth in the first row of the \n\npremaxillary and 3 to 5 teeth in the second row of the premaxillary. A single \n\nspecimen appeared to have one tooth in a third premaxillary row. Most \n\nspecimens of A. aff.fasciatus presented red coloring on the tail fin, which is \n\ncommon for this species.

Fish of the same species from different \n\nreservoirs could not be differentiated visually. PCA placed each species slightly \n\ndifferently, although overlapped (Figure 3).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.

DISCUSSION \n The Neotropical freshwater fish fauna has long been considered the \nrichest in the world [59], the result of a long evolutionary history of isolation and \n\nspecialization [46]. Freshwater fishes are highly suitable for the recovery of past \n\nbiogeographic processes and indicators of past paleohydrology [59], due to their \n\nobligatory relationship with water [46], as related forms can only occur in \n\nisolated basins if the water bodies were connected in the past. \n\n Coastal and continental drainages may shared such a past connection, \n\nbased on cytogenetic evidence from H. malabaricus, which presents seven \n\nsimilar cytotypes between the Iva\u00ed, Igua\u00e7u, Tibagi and Ribeira do Iguape rivers. \n\nStocks of Astyanax aff. fasciatus from the Furnas region might also represent \n\nevidence of prior connection between basins [9]. \n\n The geologic evolution of the chain of high mountains associated with the \n\neastern limits of the Brazilian Shield allow vicariance and isolation of fish \n\nspecies [58]. The Atlantic drainages (Doce, Para\u00edba do Sul and Ribeira) have \n\nexisted since the break-up of Gondwanaland [46]. They include (from North to \n\nSouth) the Paragua\u00e7u, Contas, Pardo and Doce rivers. These rivers have a \n\nlarge branching system of headwaters adjacent to the eastern headwaters of the \n\nS\u00e3o Francisco. Among these drainages are numerous smaller drainages that \n\nhave no contact with the S\u00e3o Francisco Basin [58]. \n\n During periods of low sea level, the coastal plane and associated river \n\nbasins were more extensive, with coastal fish species able to disperse and \n\noccupy extensive areas. Populations occupying different coastal subbasins \n\nbecame isolated due to repeated episodes of sea level rise, resulting in \n\nspeciation and population differentiation [58] Studies of fish fauna from the Doce \n\nriver show phylogenetically related fauna in the coastal and continental basins, \n\nalthough the exact causes of these relationships are not always clear [46] \n\n Compared to Amazonian Rivers, eastern costal drainages are \n\ncharacterized by relatively low diversity but considered a biogeographical unit \n\n[59] due to high levels of endemism, with 95% of species considered endemic \n\n[58]. Most species associated with the eastern margin of the Brazilian shield are \n\n\n\n40\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nendemics of either coastal or inland basins, a few species occurring on both \n\nsides of the watershed divide. species occurring on both sides of the main \n\nwatershed divide (e.g. Astyanax fasciatus) are said to have a \"pattern C\" type of \n\ngeographic distribution [58], which includes stream piracy between coastal and \n\ncrystalline Brazilian shield rivers [76]Astyanax taeniatus, a coastal freshwater \n\nfish, reaches the northern limit of its distribution range in the Mucuri and \n\nJucuru\u00e7u rivers [59] \n\n Most species inhabiting the high mountain stream Guaratuba do not \n\noccur elsewhere, but one exception is A. paranae, which is common in the \n\nupper headwaters of the Tiet\u00ea. This could be due to either erosion or tectonic \n\nfault reactivation [58]. Astyanax altiparanae is present in the coastal upper Rio \n\nItatinga as well as the upper Tiet\u00ea, presumably the result of stream capture by \n\nerosion. This species is often cited as being endemic to the upper Paran\u00e1, but \n\nhas a vicariant form A. lacustris that inhabits the S\u00e3o Francisco basin. \n\nMorphological characters of both species are variable and overlapping [58].  \n\n The area north of the mouth of the Doce River is composed of beach \n\nridges, deltas, sea cliffs and sandstone reefs, geologic structures that could \n\ndivide fish populations [59]. Bathymetric surveys of this area show that various \n\nchannels converge on the Abrolhos depression. The Pleistocene lagoons are \n\ndelimited to the south by the mouth of the Doce River and to the north by the \n\nAbrolhos Formation. Along with A. fasciatus, the trahira, Hoplias malabaricus \n\nhas one of the largest distributional ranges, occurring from Panam\u00e1 to the \n\nBuenos Aires Province in Argentina [46]. \n\n In the case of Hoplias malabaricus, closely related haplotypes were found \n\nin the Doce and S\u00e3o Mateus rivers, the latter located in Esp\u00edrito Santo State, \n\nBrazil. Samples from coastal basins presented a sister group relationship with \n\nhaplotypes from these two rivers, but not with the Rio Grande or S\u00e3o Francisco \n\n[46]. Haplotypes of H. malabaricus from the Itanhem and Jucurussu rivers show \n\na close phylogenetic relationship, supporting a more recent common \n\npalaeohydrological history involving basins within this region [59]. Molecular \n\n\n\n41\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ndata indicate no evidence of genetic exchange between the Doce and Para?ba \n\ndo Sul river populations of H. malabaricus during glacial periods [59] \n\n The lack of data on geographic distributions and phylogeny of Neotropical \n\nfreshwater fishes make it difficult to formulate hypotheses of biogeographic \n\nhistories [56]. One possibility is that species of widespread distribution are \n\nrelatively ancient, with spatial continuity broken by recent events of marine \n\ntransgression (explaining the slight differences in Astyanax across basins). \n\nSpecies of restricted distribution may be also be related to these events. \n\n \n4.1 MORPHOLOGY \n The systematics of Astyanax are poorly understood, with the Atlantic \n\nRainforest region containing several undescribed species [77]. Some \"species\" \n\nof this genus are widespread but vary geographically. Phylogenetic and \n\ntaxonomic relationships among these fishes, as well as those of limited \n\ndistribution, are not well known. Previous studies of Astyanax relied on \n\nmorphological characters such as dentition, lateral line scales, tail fin and \n\nosteology [56]. As the species of Astyanax are morphologically similar, however, \n\nit has been difficult to separate them based on this criteria.  \n\nBased on morphological characters, Professor Vinicius de Ara\u00fajo Bertaco \n\nat the Universidade Federal de Rio Grande do Sul confirmed our identification of \n\nA. giton, based on the key of Melo [56] that describes this species as follows: \n\nDentary teeth gradually decrease in size from the symphysis, differentiating this \n\nspecies from A. scabripinnis. with the base of the teeth in the dentary and \n\ninternal series of the premaxillar being thin. The central cuspid is approximately \n\nthe same size as the side cuspids, with the maximum number of cuspids \n\nexceeding 8. The interopercular does not expand further and does not cover a \n\nportion of the sub-opercular. Body height is 28.9 to 37.4% of the pattern length, \n\nwith 34 to 39 scales on the lateral line, with a rounded naked area between the \n\nsecond and third infra-orbital. \n\n Eigenmann differentiated A. fasciatus parahybae from A. fasciatus by the \n\npresence of a series of scales below the lateral line deflected toward the anal fin \n\n\n\n42\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nby the interpolation of supplementary series. Astyanax fasciatus parahybae also \n\nhas a head of 4.25 to 4.44; depth of 2.5 to 2.66; 27 to 34 (usually 31 or 32) rays \n\nin the anal fin, a lateral line with 37 to 41 (usually 39 or 40) rays. an eye equal to \n\nthe interorbital; one maxillary tooth; 4 to 5 teeth in the outer row of the \n\npremaxillary in a 2:1 ratio[3]. Melo also identified A. parahybae as having \n\nirregularly placed scales above the anal fin and the anal fin having 29 or more \n\nrays, both of which differentiate this species from A. fasciatus and definitively \n\nseparate it from the A. fasciatus complex[56]. \n\n According to Eigenmann, when A. fasciatus, A. scabripinnis and A. \n\ntaeniatus are found together in the same river it is possible to differentiate one \n\nfrom another, but across different rivers and basins each undergoes so many \n\nmodifications it is impossible to clearly define them morphologically [3]. \n\nAstyanax taeniatus in one river could be confused for A. scabripinnis, A. \n\nfasciatus, A. giton or A. intermedius in another. L\u00fctken described both A. \n\ntaeniatus and A. scabripinnis as A. scabripinnis rivularis. Jenyns recognized A. \n\ntaeniatus as an intermediate form of A. scabripinnis. Bertaco recognized A. \n\nfasciatus as A. intermedius. Eigenmann described A. intermedius as the center \n\nof a triangle formed by A. scabripinnis, A. fasciatus and A. taeniatus. \n\n Species assigned to Astyanax are not a monophyletic entity [8,78]. \n\nCurrent definition relies on morphological characters such as two rows or teeth \n\nin the premaxillary, a complete lateral line and the presence of a caudal fin, \n\nwhich are widespread in Characidae [3]. Astyanax intermedius has been \n\nincluded in the Astyanax scabripinnis species complex [78]. Astyanax \n\nintermedius has a humeral spot similar in form to A. microschemos; however A. \n\nintermedius is distinguished from this species by having a larger interorbital \n\nwidth (29.7-34.1% vs. 32.5-47.8%) \n\n Astyanax giton is most easily distinguished from A. fasciatus by the \n\npresence of a vertically elongate black humeral spot. Astyanax fasciatus \n\npresents a less conspicuous humeral spot, with the differences being most \n\npronounced after the fish have been fixed in alcohol. Body shape also differs \n\nbetween these fish, with A. giton on average having a deeper body while A. \n\n\n\n43\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nfasciatus is more elongate. The median aspect ratios (length/height) for A. giton \n\nand A. fasciatus were 3.46 and 3.80. Both species were differentiated by PCA, \n\nconcordant with Eigenmann's statement that fish of Astyanax can often be \n\ndifferentiated from one another only in larger samples [3]. The sex ratio for A. \n\ngiton from the UFV reservoirs (1 out of 32) was consistent with data from \n\nSossego Lake, where 8 males and 171 females were captured [2]. \n\n \n\n4.2 CYTOGENETICS \n The cytogenetics of A. giton from the UFV Reservoirs and the Sossego \n\nDam differ. Although both present a diploid number of 2n=50, the karyotype of \n\nA. giton from Sossego was 6m+8sm+24st+12t and FN=88 [2]. This population \n\npresented multiple heterochromatic markings with C-banding and DAPI, mostly \n\non the small arms of the submetacentric and subtelocentric chromosomes. A \n\nfaint marking also visible on the centromeric region of the largest metacentric \n\nchromosome. C-banding showed heterochromatin in four chromosome pairs, \n\nincluding a subtelocentric chromosome with bitelomeric markings. Giemsa-\n\nstained C-banding matched 18S rDNA flouresence patterns, with this probe also \n\nshowing markings in the telomeric portions of the largest metacentric pair. The \n\nNORs were present in two subtelocentric chromosomes that appear similar to \n\nthe two NOR-bearing chromosomes of the A. giton studied here. Only one pair \n\nof chromosomes was marked with the 5S rDNA probe in the Sossego Dam [2]. \n\n Astyanax giton from the two reservoirs present 22 subtelocentric and 12 \n\ntelocentric chromosomes, differing slightly from the Sossego population which \n\nhad 24 subtelocentrics and 12 telocentrics. These populations contrast with the \n\nmany (28-32) telocentric chromosomes in populations from the Para\u00edba do Sul \n\nRiver Basin [4], similar to A. intermedius, A. ribeirae and populations of A. \n\nhastatus and A. scabripinnis from coastal rivers, all of which have 34 and 38 \n\nsubtelocentric and telocentric chromosomes [60]. Although both populations of \n\nA. giton from the Doce River present many more subtelocentrics than those from \n\nthe Para\u00edba do Sul, the combined totals are still within the range of combined \n\nsubtelocentric and telocentric chromosomes. \n\n\n\n44\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n However, A. giton from both the Para\u00edba do Sul River and Sossego Dam \n\nboth present one pair of NORs and 10 chromosomes bearing 18S rDNA \n\nclusters[5], although the A. giton from Para\u00edba do Sul also contain several \n\nchromosomes bearing 5S clusters [2]. Additionally, the Sossego Dam contains \n\ntriploid A. giton (3n=75) that were not observed in the UFV Reservoirs. There \n\nare at least six species of Astyanax with triploid individuals:A. eigenmanniorum, \n\nA. scabripinnis, A. schubarti, Astyanax aff. fasciatus (from the Tibagi River in \n\nVila Velha, Paran\u00e1 State, Brazil), Astyanax sp. D [9] and A. giton (from the \n\nSossego Dam in the Doce River Basin, Minas Gerais State, Brazil) [2]. Some \n\ntriploid A. scabripinnis also carry B chromosomes [9]. \n\n To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reporting of this macro \n\nmetacentric B in A. giton. As the size and morphology of the macro B are similar \n\nto those of supernumerary chromosomes in A. fasciatus, A. scabripinnis, A. \n\neigenmanniorum, A. schubarti and A. bockmanni, it is possible that this B \n\nchromosome predates these speciation events [32-36]; however, the \n\nmorphology of a supernumerary chromosome is not necessarily indicative of its \n\norigin [25,27]. \n\nAs there was no evidence of hybridization between the species, the B \n\nchromosomes could have arisen from the A set or an ancient event of hybrid \n\nintrogression. B chromosomes were rare in the Astyanax studied from these \n\nreservoirs, with only 20 out of 1,700 (1.2%) metaphases containing any \n\nsupernumerary chromosomes. Because of their rarity, the B chromosomes \n\ncould not be tested for banding or heterochromatin, nor linked to males or \n\nfemales in particular. The A. giton with the metacentric macro B was stained for \n\nNOR, but the B did not present markings. Attempts to stain slides containing \n\nmale gonads with Giemsa were inconclusive as chromosome morphology could \n\nnot be determined. \n\n The chromosomal change rate in Astyanax is calculated at e = 3.582. \n\nUsing mtDNA, this genus has a divergence time of about 19 My, with \n\nremarkable radiation during the last 5My, especially within Astyanax fasciatus, \n\nwhich presents the shortest divergence time. The rate of karyotypic evolution is \n\n\n\n45\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nhigher than other Characiformes, with speciation events resulting from \n\npericentric inversions, heterochromatin redistribution and Robertsonion \n\nrearrangements [79].  \n\n Astyanax fasciatus from Araras, S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil, in the Mogi-\n\nGua\u00e7u River Basin (part of the Paran\u00e1 River System) were studied \n\ncytogenetically [80]. This population presented a diploid number of 2n=48 and a \n\nkaryotype of 8m+22sm+12st+6t, FN=90 -- the closest published karyotype to A. \n\naff.fasciatus of the Doce River (10sm+20sm+12st+6A, FN=90). \n\n NORs are highly variable among Astyanax fasciatus, with cytotypes in the \n\nMogi-Gua\u00e7u River ranging from two to eight NOR sites [13]. In A. aff. fasciatus \n\nfrom the reservoirs, NORs were found in the terminal regions of the short arms \n\nof three submetacentric chromosomes, as well as in the terminal regions of the \n\nlong arms of one subtelocentric and one telocentric chromosome, the latter two \n\ncoincident with secondary constrictions. NORs in the terminal regions of the \n\nshort arms of two submetacentric chromosomes (with size polymorphism) were \n\nobserved in the Araguari River, a population with a diploid number of 2n=46 and \n\na karyotype of 14m+16sm+10st+6t (FN=86) [18]. These NOR sites were also \n\nobserved in A. fasciatus from the Upper Paran\u00e1 River [7]. The Araras population \n\nhad two NORs, in the distal region of the long arms of a pair of telocentric \n\nchromosomes [80], similar to those found in the subtelocentric and telocentric \n\nchromosomes from A. aff.fasciatusin the Doce River. \n\n C-Banding in A. aff.fasciatus presented heterochromatin in nearly all \n\ncentromeres, telomeric regions of long arms of 1st metacentric pair, four \n\nsubmetacentric pairs (plus one in pair 14), two subtelocentric pairs and all three \n\ntelocentric pairs. Interstitial heterochromatin bandings were visible in long arms \n\nof one subtelocentric chromosome of the 20th pair. The Araras population was \n\nsimilar constitutive heterochromatin (C-Banding) in the distal regions of long \n\narms of submetacentric, subtelocentric and telocentric chromosmes, and short \n\narms of some other chromosomes. \n\n Astyanx fasciatus from the Mogi-Gua\u00e7u river presented constitutive \n\nheterochromatin in terminal regions on long arms of sm, st, t and terminal \n\n\n\n46\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nregions of short arms of sm chromosomes in both 48/46, which are GC-rich and \n\ncontain NORs [16]. The regions from the long arms of the sm, st and t terminal \n\nregions were coincident with data from A. aff.fasciatus. Similar markings among \n\nthe Mogi-Gua\u00e7u cytotypes indicate the proximity of these linages and a recent \n\ndivergence. Different cytotypes may cause reproductive isolation, although this \n\ndoes not appear to be the case given the presence of 2n=47 and 2n=45 \n\nspecimens [13].  \n\n FISH in A. aff.fasciatus from the Doce River presented 5S markings in the \n\nshort arms of one telocentric pair and the centromeres of one metacentric pair, \n\nand 28S markings in the short arms of two subtelocentric/telocentric pairs and \n\nthe centromere of one metacentric chromosome. 28S and 18S probes hybridize \n\nat the same sites and may therefore be compared across populations and \n\nspecies. \n\n Specimens of A. fasciatus from the Upper Paran\u00e1 present 28S markers in \n\nthe distal portion of the short arms of two submetacentric chromosomes and 5S \n\nmarkers in the pericentric region of two metacentric (similar to A. aff. fasciatus \n\nfrom the Doce River) and in two telocentric chromosomes, colocalized with 28S \n\nin the two metacentric and telocentric chromosomes [7].  \n\n Several species of Astyanax including A. altiparanae, A. lacustris, A. \n\nfasciatus, A. schubarti and A. scabripinnis show conserved localization of \n\n5S/28S markers between species, indicating a close phylogenetic relationship \n\n[7] and 5S can be seen in more than one pair [24]. NORs are almost always \n\nfewer than regions detected by FISH, because some 5S genes are associated \n\nwith rDNA genes that do not form a nucleolus because the gene sequences \n\nwere too small to be detected [7]. These 5S locations are absent in A. giton and \n\nA. intermedius, suggesting polyphyly or divergence within this genus [13]. \n\nAstyanax fasciatus from the Paran\u00e1 and Para\u00edba do Sul basins have a 5S rDNA \n\ncluster in the distal region of a metacentric chromosome [4,7].  \n\n In A. fasciatus from the Mogi-Gua\u00e7u River, FISH 18S markers were \n\nlocated in the NORs [13]. Other fluorescent markings were smaller, always \n\ntelomeric and located in subtelocentric and telocentric chromosomes, consistent \n\n\n\n47\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nwith some of the markings observed for A. aff.fasciatus. All cytotypes from the \n\nMogi-Gua\u00e7u had a ribosomal site on the subterminal region of the short arm of \n\none submetacentric pair and 5S markings in the pericentromeric region of the \n\nshort arms of one telocentric pair [13], also observed in A. aff.fasciatus from the \n\nDoce River. \n\n In the Araras population of A. fasciatus, FISH revealed two chromosomes \n\npairs with 5S, one at the pericentromeric region of one metacentric chromosome \n\nand the other at the proximal region of a telocentric chromosome, exactly like A. \n\naff.fasciatus from the Doce River. Also in Araras, three submetacentric \n\nchromosomes presented 18S markings, two in the terminal region of the short \n\narm and one in the terminal region of the long arm.  \n\n The first two 18S sites coincide with Ag-NOR in A. aff.fasciatus from the \n\nDoce River, but 28S/18S probes did not hybridize at these sites. Although \n\nhomology with the original gene sequence of A. fasciatus from Araras should be \n\nsufficeint to hybridize with the rDNA probe, in A. aff. fasciatus they may no \n\nlonger represent an active gene or functional gene product and therefore no \n\nlonger present an Ag-NOR [9]. This may occur if mutations if mutations have \n\nresulted in pseudogenes or functionless sequences (as observed in H. \n\nmalabaricus). Although the 28S sites in A. aff.fasciatus did not coincide with \n\nthose of Ag-Nor, one on the metacentric chromosome did correspond to C-\n\nbanding.  \n\n A single chromosomal pair bearing 5S DNA, often interstitially (known as \n\nmarker chromosomes) is observed in several Astyanax and probably ancestral \n\nfor this group. A second pair is also found in A. scabripinnis, A. parahybae, A. \n\nschubarti and A. fasciatus[9]. Other Astyanax, however, present several \n\nchromosomes bearing 5S but lack the marker pair, as is the case of A. giton, A. \n\nintermedius, A. janeiroensis, A. ribeirae and A. fasciatus from the Doce River, \n\nindicating these may have been lost in coastal populations [9,60]. \n\n CT 3005 and CT 3003 were the only female A. giton to have both a red \n\nanal fin and a micro B chromosome. Although it is possible these traits may be \n\n\n\n48\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ncorrelated, a much larger sample size and sequencing of the B chromosomes \n\nwould be necessary to draw such a conclusion and determine their origin. \n\n Astyanax fasciatus is known to occupy main river channels and form \n\nlarge shoals with migratory habits; therefore it is less susceptible to barriers to \n\ngene flow than other species of this genus [31,32]. Therefore it may have more \n\nopportunities to hybridize and pick up B chromosomes from interspecific \n\ncrosses. Metaphases containing B chromosomes are shown (Figures 8 and 9). \n\nAstyanax altiparanae is one of the most widely distributed groups of this genus, \n\nclosely related to A. aff. bimaculatus. These species are morphologically similar \n\nbecause of the elliptic humeral spot and yellow tail [21]. Astyanax altiparanae \n\nfrom the Tiet\u00ea and Paranapanema rivers have diploid numbers of 2n=50. \n\nKaryotypes differ, with multiple cytotypes occurring in sympatry, indicating A. \n\naltiparanae is a species complex. Hybridization has not been reported and \n\ndistinct cytotypes may represent operational taxonomic units, or cryptic species. \n\n However, molecular data indicate they are a monophyletic group despite \n\npopulation-specific haplotypes, with the populations being neither very diverse \n\nnor distant genetically [21]. All populations have one pair of NORs, in the \n\nterminal portions of either the long or short arms of subtelocentric or telocentric \n\npairs, depending on the population, similar to A. bimaculatus[21]. C-Banding \n\nwas present in the terminal and interstitial regions of several chromosomes. 18S \n\nrDNA was present in multiple sites (two to four), located in the terminal portions \n\nof subtelocentric and telocentric chromosomes, except for one site in the \n\nterminal portion of the short arms of a single metacentric chromosome of the \n\nfirst pair from the Pilar do Sul River in S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil[21]. FISH with 5S \n\nrevealed two interstitial sites on metacentric or submetacentric chromosomes. \n\nThese two sites are common to A. bockmanni, A. fasciatus [60], A. parahybae, \n\nA. scabripinnis and A. schubarti [21]. With the addition of A. eigenmanniorum, \n\nthese are also the same species that feature the large metacentric B \n\nchromosome found in A. giton from these reservoirs.  \n\n \n\n\n\n49\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n4.3 MOLECULAR DNA \n Based on mitochondrial DNA, the A. giton from the two reservoirs are \n\nidentical to those of Sossego Dam. One difference between these populations, \n\nhowever, is that the A. giton from Sossego are hybridizing with Oligosarcus \n\nargenteus, but no hybrids were found at either reservoir despite the presence \n\nthis genus. If hybridization were advantageous it would presumably occur in \n\nboth lakes; if disadvantageous, Astyanax and Oligosarcus should be good \n\nspecies and not interbreed. It may be that the species have adapted different \n\nstrategies based on conditions unique to each area, as the size of the water \n\nsystem may drive evolution through physical, chemical and biotic populational \n\nbarriers [37].  It is also possible that the B chromosomes found in A. giton are \n\nthe result of a past hybridization event, either with Oligosarcus argenteus or \n\nanother species. As B chromosomes are heteropycnotic (i.e., they do not pair \n\nwith the a set) interspecific interactions may be sufficient that chromosomes that \n\ncannot pair will evolve as Bs [27].  \n\n Molecular data place A. aff.fasciatus completely in the same clade as A. \n\nfasciatus and A. parahybae. As stated by Eigenmann, A. parahybae may be a \n\ndistinct form of A. fasciatus in the Para\u00edba do Sul River, where A. fasciatus is \n\nabsent, the result of lineages being isolated in rivers on the eastern coastal \n\nbasins [3,58], although it is currently defined as a separate species [9,56]. \n\n When populations present similar morphology and molecular data but \n\ndiffer by cytotype, the question arises whether or not to treat them as distinct \n\nspecies. In a study of four populations of A. hastatus from the Guapimirim River \n\nBasin (Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, three cyotypes were found, all 2n=50 [41]. \n\nThese were considered a group of cryptic species, not species complexes, \n\nbecause each cytotype could be precisely identified and biological boundaries \n\namong analyzed specimens were supported by cytogenetic markers, revealing a \n\nlack of interbreeding and hybrid forms. The cytotypes could not be differentiated \n\nthrough morphometric analysis [41]. According to the Darwinian species concept \n\n(species recognized as morphological and genotypic cluster) these cannot be \n\nconsidered individual species. According to biological concept of Mayr, however, \n\n\n\n50\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nthey should correspond to real species since distinct karyotypes found with \n\nlimited gene flow but no evidence of hybridization. This type of analysis could be \n\napplied to A. fasciatus and A. giton. \n\n \n\n5. CONCLUSION \n Two species of Astyanax from the Doce River were analyzed using \n\nmorphological, cytogenetic and molecular techniques. All characters indicate \n\nthese fish are A. giton and Astyanax aff.fasciatus. Morphological characters \n\noverlap but may be differentiated using statistical analysis. Diploid numbers \n\nwere consistent with those previously documented for these species but \n\nchromosome morphology differ. Astyanax giton may be a species complex \n\nbased on a new karyotype occurring in the Doce River basin and the presence \n\nof B chromosomes. The mtDNA fragment COI indicates these fish are in \n\nseparate clades. Follow-up studies could include a comparison of Astyanax \n\naff.fasciatus with populations of A. fasciatus and A. parahybae, testing the idea \n\nof species complexes versus cryptic species and sequencing the supernumerary \n\nB chromosomes of both species. \n\n \n\n\n\n51\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n6.
