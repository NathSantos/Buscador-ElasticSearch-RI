INTRODUCTION \n\nSorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) is the fifth \nmost important cereal in the world, preceded by wheat, \nrice, corn and barley and it is one of the most versatile \nand efficient of them regarding its photosynthesis and \nmaturation speed (RIBAS, 2003). This crop demands less \nwater to develop when compared to other cereals and, \nwhen compared to corn, sorghum produces more under \nwater stress (the roots exploits the soil profile better), \ndries up less and is able to recover from longer drought \n\n(MAGALH\u00c3ES; DUR\u00c3ES, 2003). Sorghum is an \nimportant alternative to help the provision of grains and, \nbecause of its nutritional characteristics, it has been \nstudied as an alternate energetic ingredient to corn. The \nsorghum cultivation has great yield potential in regions \nwith irregular rainfall due to its adaptation capacity and \ntolerance to high temperatures (REIS, 1992). \n\nIn Brazil, information on adaptability and stability of \nsorghum are scarce. The cultivars behavior analyses are \nextremely important to verify its performance over the \n\n\n\nTANAKA et al. (2014). Development of sorghum plants submitted under different water table levels in glasshouse \n\n \n\nNativa, Sinop, v. 02, n. 01, p. 18-22, jan./mar. 2014 \n\n19 \n\ncycle (SILVA et al., 2005). The forage sorghum, for \nexample, shows growth expectation in semi-arid region \ndue to its characteristics xerophytes and recovers after \nstress, ensuring production under adverse conditions \n(SCAPIM et al., 1998). The Brazilian grain production \ndepends almost entirely on rainfall. In years when the \nweather conditions are unfavorable, there is generally a \ndeficit in grain production, because they are crops \ncultivated under adverse weather and soil conditions, can \nreduce the impact of this factor in the provision of grains. \nA sorghum plant tolerates water deficit and excessive soil \nmoisture content as well as too dry and/or too hot \nenvironmental situations, where the productivity of other \ncereals is not economic.  \n\nThe experimental investigation on evapotranspiration \nto determine the water needs of crops has been \nexhaustively studied in recent decades, due to the need to \nconduct irrigation in a rational way within the reality of \neach region (LUNARDI, 2000). The water requirements \nof crop and soil conditions are the principal factors for the \ndesign of an irrigation system (FOLEGATTI, 1988; \nREICHARDT, 1996; PEREIRA et al., 1997). According \nto Silveira; Klar (2001), the problem worsens when there \nare not enough data that allow knowing the crop yield \nreduction caused by different water table levels. \n\nThe water requirement determination and crop \ncoefficient (Kc) by lysimeters has been employed in \nBrazil. Water table constant lysimeters were considered \naccurate for studies of small crops (PAVANI, 1985). \nAlves et al. (1994), in order to verify the importance of \nthe area in the lysimeter capillary rise, assembled a \nbattery of soil columns in PVC tubes with several \ndiameters to examine the possible influence of capillary \nrise in small areas and concluded that the diameter of soil \ncolumns did not interfere with the capillary rise and \nfurther this is a specific phenomenon of soil, regardless of \nthe vessel that is confining. \n\nThus, this study aimed to evaluate the development of \nsorghum plants submitted to different water table levels in \nglasshouse, in Botucatu \u2013 S\u00e3o Paulo state. \n\n \n2. MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\nThis study was carried out in the experimental area of \nthe Department of Rural Engineering of the College of \nAgronomical Sciences of UNESP \u2013 Botucatu, S\u00e3o Paulo \nState, Brazil, in latitude of 22\u00ba51\u2019 S, longitude of 48\u00ba26\u2019 \nW and altitude of 786 meters. The glasshouse was 6 m \nlong, 4 m wide and 3 m high, painted with 10 cm white \nstripes in order to decrease the environment internal \nenergy.  \n\nThe weather of the region, according to K\u00f6eppen \nclassification is Cwa characterized: hot subtropical \nweather (mesothermal) with rainfall in the summer and \ndrought in the winter, and the average temperature of the \nhottest month is over 22\u00baC (CENTRO DE PESQUISAS \nMETEOROL\u00d3GICAS E CLIM\u00c1TICAS APLICADAS \u00c0 \nAGRICULTURA \u2013 CEPAGRI, 2009). We used sorghum \nseeds of Catissorgo cultivar with sowing on December 23, \n2008 and the final harvest on March 23, 2009. The seeds \nwere treated with captan (200 g i a./100 kg seeds) and five \nseeds were sown per pot.  \n\nThe Catissorgo cultivar has double purpose, it can be \nused as forage and grain production, and has the \n\nfollowing characteristics: cycle of 115 days for grain, 90 \ndays for silage; planting occurs from January to March; \nflowering period from 70 to 75 days after planting (DAP), \nheight is about 1.40 m and stand of 120,000 plants per \nhectare (COORDENADORIA DE ASSIST\u00caNCIA \nT\u00c9CNICA INTEGRAL \u2013 CATI, 2009). \n\nThe equipment to measure the crop evapotranspiration \nconsisted: the pots were 150 mm diameter PVC tubes \nwith PVC covers on the bottom perforated to allow \ncapillary irrigation. Each pot consisted rings of 7cm \nheight, attached with adhesive tape and forming tubes \nwith 21, 35, 49, 63 and 77 cm high. Tubes were partially \nburied (approximately 4 cm, discounted on total height) in \nsand, to simulate five water tables depths (17; 31; 45; 59 \nand 73 cm; treatments T1; T2; T3; T4; T5, respectively), \non white metal trays measuring 40 cm wide, 60 cm long \nand 14 cm high, and filled with thick washed sand.  \n\nThe trays had an intermediate chamber provided with \na float level controller ball to keep constant water level. \nThis chamber was filled up by a water reservoir graduated \nin millimeters, consisting of an 80 cm high, 15 cm \ndiameter PVC tube. The water supply of the intermediate \nchamber was done by a 2 cm perforated PVC tube \ndiameter. In order to evaluate only the pot \nevapotranspiration, the interstices among them were filled \nup with paraffin and part of the reservoir was sealed with \nStyrofoam (Figure 1). \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1. Reservoir, tray and tubes. (Source: Adapted from \nSILVEIRA; KLAR, 2001). \n\n \nThe pots were filled with soil and reservoirs received \n\nwater one week before planting in order to stabilize the \ncapillarity process (SILVEIRA; KLAR, 2001). The soil \nused to fill up the pots was obtained from an area close to \nthe glasshouse in the Department of Rural Engineering (0-\n20 cm layer) and it was corrected and fertilized following \nthe recommendations of the Technical Bulletin 100 (RAIJ \net al., 1997).  \n\nThe temperature and relative air humidity inside the \nglasshouse were measured by psycrometer with forced \nventilation. The evapotranspiration data were obtained by \nevaporimetric pan of 60 cm diameter and 25.5 cm height. \nThe analyzed responses of sorghum plants to different \ntreatments were: fresh and dry matter, and height and \nstem diameter of plants; fresh and dry matter and length \nof panicles; crop evapotranspiration (ETc), Kc \n(=ETc/ETo).  \n\nWA. \u2013 water level \n\n\n\nTANAKA et al.

The pots \nwere disassembled and roots were collected to get dry \nmatter. \n\nThe experiment design was completely randomized \nwith five treatments and 10 replications. The data were \ncompared by Tukey\u2019s test at 5% of probability using \nSisvar (2003) software. \n \n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nThe emergence of plants started on December 27th, \n2008 (4 DAP) and extended until January 4th, 2009 as \nshown in Table 1. The thinning was done on January \n12th, 2009, leaving 2 plants per pot. In order to allow seed \ngermination of deeper treatments (T3, T4, T5 and T6), \nwas added 100 ml of water every day until there were \nfour expanded leaves. The treatments with more available \nwater emerged before the other ones. \n\n \nTable 1.

(1982) report that sorghum crop presents \n\nsome problems related to the physiological quality of \nseeds that affect the initial emergence due to its \ngermination was not uniform. Treatment T5 (73 cm) had a \nproblem at first and started emergence at 10 days after \nplanting. Alves et al. (1994) observed that the diameter of \nsoil columns (ranging from 5 to 25 cm), does not \ninfluence capillary ascension to tubes up to 1.5 meters \nheight. \n\nThe flowering duration of sorghum plants, regarding \nthe 10 replications, is represented in Table 2. Treatments \nT1, T2 and T5 were the last ones, starting their flowering \nat 68, 69 and 74 DAP. The T3 flowering duration was 8 \ndays and T1, 22 days. The T4 was the most precocious, \nbeginning its flowering at 62 DAP and lasting 16 days. \nAccording to Magalh\u00e3es; Dur\u00e3es (2003), the flowering \nduration ranged from 6 to 15 days and occurred at 60 to \n82 DAP; corroborating with the results found in this study \nwhere: flowering duration was from 8 to 22 days and at \n74 DAP. \n\nThe averages of fresh and dry matter weight of \nsorghum plant aerial parts were statistically analyzed by \nTukey\u2019s test at 5%, and it is observed in Table 3 that there \nwere differences among treatments. Treatments T4 (137.3 \ng) and T5 (131.5 g) significantly had the greatest fresh \nmatter weights while compared to T1 (89.4 g) and T2 (31 \n\ng), which is probably a result of the lower volume of \navailable plant roots. Treatment T3 did not differs \nstatistically from the other ones, considering their fresh \nand dry matter aerial part weights. Treatment T4 (64.01 g) \nstatistically presented the greatest aerial part dry matter \nweight, when compared to treatments T5 (41.07 g), T1 \n(37.52 g) and T2 (36.25 g) that had the lowest ones. \n \nTable 2.

(2008) who worked with forage sorghum \nand observed a decrease in the production of fresh and dry \nmatter when submitted to flooding and compared to levels \nof T1 and T2. In T5, plants started developing like in the \nother treatments even germination was late due to the \ndelay to receive water from the water table (Table 1). This \ntreatment also had some discrepancies in height (Table 4) \nthat influenced dry matter values (Table 3) with \nsignificant lower data than T4, but with larger stem \ndiameter (Table 4) when compared to T1 and T2. \n\n \nTable 3.

These variables for \npanicles, as well as the length, tend to have higher values \nfor treatments from 59 to 73 cm;  \n\nThe plants tended to be higher in treatments with 45 \ncm (130.55 cm) and 59 cm (133.80 cm). To stem \ndiameter, there were no significant statistic values among \nthe treatments with 45, 59 and 73 cm. However, they \nwere significantly different from the ones cultivated in \nwater tables closer to the surface; The 17 cm water table \npresented fresh and dry matter values statistically lower \nthan the other treatments; The crop evapotranspiration \npresented similar values, except for treatments with 17 \nand 73 cm that had lower values; Kc values (ETc/ETo) \nhad an average of 0.50 in the first stage (until flowering) \nand 1.30 in the following one. \n\n \n5.
