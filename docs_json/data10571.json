Devido \u00e0 baixa diversidade de esp\u00e9cies produzidas na Europa, surgiu \n\na necessidade de diversificar os produtos atualmente produzidos, com a \n\nimplementa\u00e7\u00e3o de novas esp\u00e9cies pass\u00edveis de serem criadas a um n\u00edvel industrial. \n\nNesse contexto, foi proposta a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o da cria\u00e7\u00e3o e produ\u00e7\u00e3o de corvina \n\n(Argyrosomus regius), por apresentar caracter\u00edsticas necess\u00e1rias a uma produ\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nsustent\u00e1vel: requisitos biol\u00f3gicos facilmente ating\u00edveis (crescimento, fecundidade e \n\ncria\u00e7\u00e3o em cativeiro), requisitos tecnol\u00f3gicos (\u00edndice de convers\u00e3o apropriado, ciclo de \n\nvida bem conhecido) e requisitos de mercado (penetra\u00e7\u00e3o de mercado, alto valor \n\ncomercial e disponibilidade anual), que, em conjunto com um custo de produ\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nreduzido, podem competir com as esp\u00e9cies j\u00e1 cultivadas. \n\nA corvina faz parte da fam\u00edlia Sciaenidae, sendo uma das maiores fam\u00edlias de \n\npeixes roncadores, incluindo 270 esp\u00e9cies dentro de 70 g\u00e9neros. S\u00e3o peixes \n\nroncadores, porque emitem sons durante a \u00e9poca de desova. Possuem uma ampla \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o entre as regi\u00f5es temperadas e tropicais do Mundo, incluindo Portugal, de \n\nNorte a Sul. Atualmente j\u00e1 existem sete esp\u00e9cies cultivadas a n\u00edvel comercial e/ou \n\nexperimental, das quais a corvina faz parte. A corvina \u00e9 um peixe tele\u00f3steo, sendo um \n\ndos maiores membros da fam\u00edlia Sciaenidae. Pode crescer mais de 180 cm de \n\ncomprimento total e peso superior a 50 kg. Tem uma ampla distribui\u00e7\u00e3o, estando \n\npresente nos mares Mediterr\u00e2neo e Negro, na costa Atl\u00e2ntica da Europa e costa oeste \n\nafricana, onde vivem em estu\u00e1rios e \u00e1guas costeiras, pr\u00f3ximo do fundo ou perto da \n\nsuperf\u00edcie (profundidades variam de 15 a 200 m). A qualidade da carne \u00e9 de alto valor \n\nnutricional, dando origem ao seu nome latino regius, para qualidade \u201creal\u201d da sua \n\ncarne. O ciclo de vida j\u00e1 est\u00e1 fechado, com muitas \u201chatcheries\u201d espalhadas por toda a \n\nEuropa, sendo a engorda feita com sucesso em jaulas ou tanques (pr\u00e1tica realizada \n\nnos pa\u00edses do Mediterr\u00e2neo, como Gr\u00e9cia, Fran\u00e7a, It\u00e1lia, Espanha e Egito). Apesar \n\ndas t\u00e9cnicas para as diferentes fases de cria\u00e7\u00e3o estarem bem estabelecidas, a \n\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o ainda n\u00e3o atingiu o seu potencial pleno, principalmente devido aos \n\nprotocolos alimentares, uma vez que estes s\u00e3o os mesmos utilizados em outras \n\nesp\u00e9cies, com requisitos bem conhecidos em termos de nutrientes. \u00c9 um peixe \n\ncarn\u00edvoro, que, com a alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o apropriada, consegue atingir 1 kg em menos de um \n\nano (cultivo em jaulas), pelo que um r\u00e1cio prote\u00edna:l\u00edpido apropriado ser\u00e1 a resposta \n\npara esse elevado crescimento.  \n\nRelativamente \u00e0 formula\u00e7\u00e3o de uma dieta apropriada, o valor de prote\u00edna \n\nalimentar dever\u00e1 ser superior a 45%, e o valor de l\u00edpidos n\u00e3o superior a 17%, em \n\ntermos de ra\u00e7\u00e3o total. Os amino\u00e1cidos e os \u00e1cidos gordos essenciais fornecidos nas \n\nra\u00e7\u00f5es permitem criar balan\u00e7os energ\u00e9ticos que ir\u00e3o sustentar o r\u00e1pido crescimento da \n\ncorvina. Os \u00e1cidos gordos s\u00e3o colocados nas ra\u00e7\u00f5es atrav\u00e9s de \u00f3leos de peixe, que \n\ncont\u00eam \u00e1cidos gordos saturados, monoinsaturados e polinsaturados, sendo estes \n\n\u00faltimos aqueles que possuem efeitos ben\u00e9ficos para o ser humano \u2013 \u00f3mega-3. Os \n\n\u00e1cidos eicosapentaen\u00f3ico (EPA) e docosahexaen\u00f3ico (DHA) s\u00e3o os principais \u00e1cidos \n\ngordos fornecidos pelos \u00f3leos de peixe, e essenciais a todos os peixes. Hidratos de \n\ncarbono s\u00e3o utilizados na formula\u00e7\u00e3o das ra\u00e7\u00f5es, servindo como uma fonte de uso \n\n\n\n \n\nIII \n\n \n\nlimitada para produ\u00e7\u00e3o de energia, bem como para dar forma e estabilidade \u00e0s ra\u00e7\u00f5es. \n\nMinerais e vitaminas tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o introduzidos nas ra\u00e7\u00f5es, para suplementar \n\ndefici\u00eancias a esse n\u00edvel. \n\nPara averiguar quais os n\u00edveis \u00f3timos de prote\u00ednas e l\u00edpidos a incluir nas ra\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nde corvina, e averiguar como esses nutrientes s\u00e3o utilizados, foi realizado um ensaio \n\nexperimental, com dura\u00e7\u00e3o total de 12 semanas. \n\nCinco dietas isoenerg\u00e9ticas (21,92\u00b10,57 MJ/kg) (m\u00e9dia\u00b1desvpad) foram criadas, \n\ncom varia\u00e7\u00f5es nos n\u00edveis de prote\u00edna (44% e 50%) e l\u00edpidos (12%, 15% e 18%), sendo \n\ndenominadas de 44L15, 44L18, 50L12, 50L15 e 50L18. O ensaio decorreu desde \n\nSetembro/2011 a Dezembro/2011 (63 dias), com um n\u00famero inicial de 945 peixes \n\n(63,66\u00b12,78 g), distribu\u00eddos aleatoriamente por 15 tanques de fibra de vidro (volume \n\ntotal de 1500L), em grupos triplicados. Os peixes foram aclimatados durante uma \n\nsemana, e o ensaio come\u00e7ou posteriormente. Os peixes eram alimentados \n\ndiariamente, \u00e0s 9h00 e \u00e0s 16h (dias de semana) e \u00e0s 9h e \u00e0s 13h (fins de semana), \n\nsendo a alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o feita \u00e0 m\u00e3o, ad libitum (at\u00e9 \u00e0 sacia\u00e7\u00e3o). \n\nForam realizadas quatro amostragens: uma inicial, duas interm\u00e9dias, e uma final. \n\nEm todas houve verifica\u00e7\u00e3o do peso corporal e tamanho, sendo que na final foram \n\nsacrificados 12 peixes, dos quais 6 foram usados para a an\u00e1lise corporal proximal, e \n\noutros 6 para an\u00e1lise do conte\u00fado lip\u00eddico das amostras de m\u00fasculo e f\u00edgado (l\u00edpidos \n\ntotais e perfil de \u00e1cidos gordos). A an\u00e1lise estat\u00edstica foi realizada com recurso ao \n\nsoftware STATISTICA 11.0, onde os dados foram sujeitos \u00e0 an\u00e1lise de vari\u00e2ncia \n\n(ANOVA), com p&lt;0,05 e quando normalidade e homocedasticidade eram cumpridas. \n\nCaso contr\u00e1rio, testes n\u00e3o param\u00e9tricos \u2013 an\u00e1lise de vari\u00e2ncia Kruskal-Wallis \u2013 eram \n\nrealizados para averiguar diferen\u00e7as. \n\nNo geral, e tendo em conta os par\u00e2metros de crescimento calculados, a dieta \n\n50L18 apresentou o melhor desempenho, quando comparada com as outras dietas, \n\numa vez que possui os n\u00edveis desejados de prote\u00edna e de l\u00edpidos, com prote\u00edna > 45% \n\ne l\u00edpidos ? 17%. Por outro lado, a alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o 50L12 teve o pior desempenho, \n\nprincipalmente por causa dos baixos n\u00edveis de lip\u00eddios na dieta. As taxas de SGR (taxa \n\nde crescimento espec\u00edfico) devem ser maiores do que 1% / dia, situa\u00e7\u00e3o alcan\u00e7ada \n\ncom as dietas 50L15 e 50L18 que possu\u00edam os SGR mais elevados, de 0,99\u00b10,04 e \n\n1,21\u00b10,00, respetivamente. Dentro do grupo com 50% de prote\u00edna, a dieta 50L18 \n\napresentou a maior Taxa de Crescimento Di\u00e1rio (DGI): 1,78\u00b10,03 %, a maior Efici\u00eancia \n\nda Ra\u00e7\u00e3o (FE): 0,97\u00b10,04, e o maior R\u00e1cio de Efici\u00eancia Proteica (PER): 2,33\u00b10,09, \n\npossuindo o menor valor m\u00e9dio de R\u00e1cio de Convers\u00e3o Alimentar (FCR): 1,04\u00b10,04. O \n\nvalor de DGI obtido \u00e9 devido aos elevados valores de prote\u00edna e l\u00edpido presentes na \n\nra\u00e7\u00e3o, que acabaram por se refletir num peso final superior aos outros tratamentos. O \n\nvalor de PER est\u00e1 relacionado com valores elevados de FE, bem como de peso final \n\nelevado, situa\u00e7\u00e3o que se confirmou com esta dieta, visto que os peixes que cresceram \n\nmais foram aqueles que se alimentaram mais. O FCR ao ser mais baixo que nas \n\noutras dietas indica que, com a mesma quantidade de alimento, a convers\u00e3o da dieta \n\n50L18 em elementos bio dispon\u00edveis \u00e9 feita com maior efic\u00e1cia. A dieta 50L18 tamb\u00e9m \n\nfoi aquela que apresentou os valores m\u00e9dios mais elevados para a reten\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nprote\u00edna (42,24\u00b12,50 %) e energia (26,98\u00b10,47 %), bem como para os valores m\u00e9dios \n\nde ganho di\u00e1rio de nitrog\u00e9nio (N) (334,56\u00b18,26 mg/kg/dia) e energia (0,71\u00b10,04 \n\nkJ/kg/dia). Com estes valores, fica confirmado que dietas com valores aproximados de \n\n\n\n \n\nIV \n\n \n\n50% prote\u00edna s\u00e3o essenciais para o crescimento da corvina. A dieta 50L12 apresentou \n\no pior valor de ganho di\u00e1rio de energia (0,51\u00b10,16 kJ/kg/dia), o que indica que n\u00e3o \n\nser\u00e1 apropriada para o cultivo de corvina, inclusive por apresentar uma reten\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nl\u00edpidos (17,65\u00b113,01 %) bastante inferior aos outros tratamentos. \n\nRelativamente \u00e0 composi\u00e7\u00e3o proximal dos peixes alimentados com cada dieta \n\nexperimental, em termos de mat\u00e9ria seca, a dieta 44L18 foi a que apresentou o menor \n\nvalor m\u00e9dio de prote\u00edna (64,97\u00b12,32 %) em oposi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 dieta 50L12 (69,94\u00b13,11 %), \n\nsendo o valor de l\u00edpidos o que mais influencia o valor de prote\u00edna presente. A dieta \n\n50L12 apresentou o menos valor m\u00e9dio de l\u00edpidos (16,78\u00b12,86 %), sendo ainda menos \n\ndo que o inicial (19,63\u00b10,14 %), o que indica a m\u00e1 performance desta dieta. Em \n\ntermos de mat\u00e9ria fresca, as dietas do grupo de 50% prote\u00edna possu\u00edram melhor \n\nperformance que a dieta 44L18, sendo que esta, numa base de mat\u00e9ria fresca de \n\nl\u00edpidos e de energia, obteve os valores m\u00e9dios mais elevados (6,53\u00b10,94 % e \n\n6,44\u00b10,29 % respetivamente), visto possuir uma elevada concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de l\u00edpidos e um \n\nvalor mais reduzido de prote\u00edna. \n\nEm termos de deposi\u00e7\u00e3o lip\u00eddica, o conte\u00fado lip\u00eddico do f\u00edgado foi maior no \n\ntratamento 50L18 do que no 50L12 (63,11\u00b13,98 % vs. 53,01\u00b17,61 %), mas semelhante \n\nao tratamento 44L18 (58,26 \u00b1 10,05 %). Os valores de l\u00edpidos musculares n\u00e3o s\u00e3o \n\nsignificativamente diferentes entre os cinco tratamentos, possuindo um valor m\u00e9dio de \n\n2,3 %. O perfil de \u00e1cidos gordos (AG) dos diferentes tratamentos n\u00e3o exibe diferen\u00e7as \n\nsignificativas, possuindo valores m\u00e9dios de AG saturados ?32%, AG monoinsaturados \n\n?20%, de AG polinsaturados ?43% e a rela\u00e7\u00e3o (n-3)/(n-6) ?4,2, sendo valores muito \n\nbons. Estes resultados, juntamente com os baixos \u00edndices aterog\u00e9nico e \n\ntrombog\u00e9nico, prova que a corvina \u00e9 uma excelente fonte de \u00f3mega-3, essenciais \n\nparam uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o card\u00edaca saud\u00e1vel. \n\nN\u00e3o obstante que a prote\u00edna \u00e9 o ingrediente mais caro na formula\u00e7\u00e3o de ra\u00e7\u00f5es, \n\numa dieta apropriada para a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de corvina a um n\u00edvel comercial dever\u00e1 possuir \n\naproximadamente 50% de conte\u00fado proteico, e possuir entre 15 a 18% de conte\u00fado \n\nlip\u00eddico, sendo estes valores uma boa abordagem para uma dieta ideal que poderia \n\nmaximizar o crescimento e baixar custos. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Argyrosomus regius; R\u00e1cio prote\u00edna:l\u00edpido; Crescimento; Perfil \n\nlip\u00eddico; \u00c1cidos gordos polinsaturados.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nV \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nThis study investigates the effects of dietary lipid and protein levels in the growth, \n\nfeed utilization and body composition of meagre (Argyrosomus regius). Triplicate \n\ngroups of 945 juvenile fish (63,66\u00b12,78 g average weight\u00b1SD) were fed for 63 days five \n\nisoenergetic diets (21,79\u00b10,17 kJ) containing 44 and 50% of crude protein, and 12, 15 \n\nand 18% of crude lipids, named 44L15, 44L18, 50L12, 50L15 and 50L18. Mean values \n\nof fishes fed diet 50L18 were significantly higher than all other treatments, regarding \n\nfinal body weight (136,09\u00b11,00 g), specific growth rate (1,21\u00b10,00 %), daily growth \n\nindex (1,78\u00b10,03 %) and protein efficiency ratio (2,33\u00b10,09), with the %crude protein in \n\nthe feed to affect the last to parameters. Voluntary feed index of fish was affected by \n\nthe %crude lipid in the feed, with diet 44L18 to have significantly higher values \n\n(1,28\u00b10,11 %) than diets 44L15 and 50L12. Fish fed diet 50L18 had significantly higher \n\nvalues of food conversion ratio (1,04\u00b10,04) than all diets, except diet 50L12. The \n\nretention of dry matter and protein had significant differences, with diet 50L18 to have \n\nthe highest values (27,60\u00b10,98 % and 42,24\u00b12,50 %, respectively), and to also \n\npossess the highest daily gain of nitrogen and energy. No significant differences were \n\nfound in the values of lipid and energy retention, and in the daily gain of lipid. \n\nSignificant differences were found between the mean lipid deposition on liver, but not \n\non the muscle samples. The fatty acid profile was not significantly different between \n\ntreatments, and neither were the Atherogenicity and Thrombogenicity indexes. Overall, \n\nthe results indicated that the best growth performance was observed in fishes fed the \n\n50L18 diet, but with excessive mesenteric fat deposition in the abdominal wall. In \n\nconclusion, meagre feeds should have around 50% crude protein and between 15 to \n\n18% crude lipid. \n\n \n\nKeywords:  Argyrosomus regius; Ratio protein:lipid; Growth; Lipid profile; \n\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids.  \n\n\n\n \n\nVI \n\n \n\nINDEX \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I \n\nRESUMO II \n\nABSTRACT V \n\nINDEX VI \n\n1 INTRODUCTION 1 \n\n1.1 Aquaculture - present situation and trends: 1 \n\n1.2 The Sciaenidae family: 2 \n\n1.2.1 Japanese croaker (Argyrosomus japonicus) (Temminck and Schlegel, 1843): 3 \n\n1.2.2 Brown meagre (Sciaena umbra) (Linnaeus, 1758): 3 \n\n1.2.3 Red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) (Linnaeus, 1766): 4 \n\n1.2.4 Meagre (Argyrosomus regius) (Asso, 1801): 4 \n\n1.3 Nutritional requirements of meagre: 7 \n\n1.3.1 Macronutrients 8 \n\n1.3.1.1 Proteins: 8 \n\n1.3.1.2 Lipids: 9 \n\n1.3.1.2.1 Fish oils: 10 \n\n1.3.1.2.2 Fatty acids: 10 \n\n1.3.1.2.3 Saturated fatty acids: 12 \n\n1.3.1.2.4 Monoenoic fatty acids: 12 \n\n1.3.1.2.5 Methylene-interrupted polyunsaturated acids: 12 \n\n1.3.1.3 Carbohydrates: 16 \n\n1.3.2 Micronutrients: 16 \n\n1.3.2.1 Vitamins: 16 \n\n1.3.2.2 Minerals: 18 \n\n1.4 OBJECTIVES: 19 \n\n2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 19 \n\n2.1 Experimental diets: 19 \n\n2.2 Experimental fish and feeding trial: 21 \n\n2.3 Sampling methods: 21 \n\n2.4 Analytical methods 22 \n\n2.4.1 Proximate analysis of diets and fish tissues 22 \n\n2.4.2 Growth performance 22 \n\n2.4.3 Total lipids 24 \n\n\n\n \n\nVII \n\n \n\n2.4.3.1 Fatty acid profile 24 \n\n2.5 Statistical analysis 25 \n\n3 RESULTS 26 \n\n3.1 Proximate analysis of diets 26 \n\n3.2 Proximate analysis of whole body composition 26 \n\n3.3 Growth performance 28 \n\n3.4 Nutrient retention and gain 31 \n\n3.5 Total lipids 33 \n\n3.6 Fatty acid profile 34 \n\n3.7 Feeding behavior 38 \n\n4 DISCUSSION 38 \n\n5 CONCLUSION 41 \n\n6 REFERENCES 42 \n\n\n\n \n\n1 \n\n \n\n1 INTRODUCTION \n\n1.1 Aquaculture - present situation and trends: \n\n \n\nAquaculture is one of the most modern types of farming practiced in the World. It \n\nstarted around 2000-1000 B.C., with the Chinese being the first ones to put the knowledge \n\ninto practice (Rabanal, 1988). Nowadays, due to the huge increase in human population, \n\ndemand for animal products and its derivates is increasing drastically, where aquaculture \n\nrepresents one of the most important forms of supplying the World with food.  In 2002, China \n\nwas the world biggest producer of aquaculture products, in spite of the majority where \n\nfreshwater products (Brug\u00e8re and Ridler, 2004), followed by India and Indonesia. It\u2019s \n\nnoteworthy that the main producers are found in Asia, and not the developed countries. \n\nThese countries produce low value fish rather than high value finfish (Brug\u00e8re and Ridler, \n\n2004), which is accordingly with the low income of the population. In 2008, the aquaculture \n\nindustry accounted for 45,7 % of the world\u2019s fish food production for human consumption \n\n(FAO, 2012), almost half of the world needs, which demonstrates the great growing potential \n\nof this industry. \n\nWhen we talk about the number of species that are produced by aquaculture, the big \n\ngrowth happened within the countries mentioned above, that produced mainly inland water \n\nspecies (Table 1): \n\n \n\nTable 1.1 \u2013 Number of species items with statistics in the FAO capture database. Adapted \n\nfrom FAO (2012)a. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2001 2010 Variation 2001-2010 \n\n(Number) (Number) (Percentage) \n\nInland water fish, crustaceans and molluscs 113 190 +68.1 \n\nMarine and diadromous fish, crustaceans \nand molluscs \n\n1 194 1 356 +13.6 \n\nTotal species items 1 307 1 546 +18.3 \n\nShare of inland water species on total \nspecies \n\n8.6% 12.3%  \n\n \n\nThe small increase of marine and diadromous fishes demonstrates the difficulties of \n\ngrowing new species, being necessary to study their complex biology, the feeding habits, \n\nreproduction cycles and environmental needs, for artificially grow them in aquaculture \n\nsystems.  \n\nIn Europe, the main aquaculture producers are Norway, Spain, France, UK and Italy \n\n(FAO, 2012; Zampogna, 2009). The marine and diadromous fishes grown are very well \n\nknown, with extensive studied biology and optimized feeding protocols, such as Atlantic \n\nsalmon (Salmo salar), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), European eel (Anguilla \n\n\n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\nanguilla), gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) and European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) \n\n(Zampogna, 2009). Due to the relative small diversity of marine fishes grown in Europe, \n\nthere are proposals of trying to introduce new species in the commercial circuit of \n\naquaculture (Qu\u00e9m\u00e9ner, 2002; Roo et al., 2010; Chatzifotis et al., 2011), preferably ones \n\nthat comply with biological (growth, fecundity and growing in captivity), technological \n\n(appropriate conversion index, life cycle well known) and market (decline in commercial \n\ncatches, market breadth, high commercial value and annual availability) favorable \n\ncharacteristics, that, together with a reduced production cost, can compete with the species \n\nalready cultivated (Iglesias and S\u00e1nchez, 2008; FAO, 2012). \n\n \n\n1.2 The Sciaenidae family: \n\n \n\nThe Sciaenidae is among the largest families of sonic fishes, including 270 species \n\nwithin 70 genera (Chao, 1986). They are sonic fishes, because they emit sounds during the \n\nspawning season (primarily), composed of bursts of knocking, drumming or crocking sounds \n\n(Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2005; Ueng et al., 2007; C\u00e1rdenas, 2010). With a wide distribution among \n\nthe temperate and tropical regions of the world (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2005), the great \n\nrepresentation of the sciaenids occurs in the Indo-Pacific region, with around 65 species \n\n(Leis and Trnski, 1989), in the Caribbean, with 17 genera (Randall, 1983), and the \n\ntemperate waters of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans \u2013 2 species are present in the Amazon \n\nbasin and 5 within the Mediterranean sea (Fischer, Bauchot and Schneider, 1987). \n\nAccording to C\u00e1rdenas (2010) and references there in, there are seven species \n\nbeing farmed in a commercial and/or experimental level:  \n\n? Japanese meagre (Argyrosomus japonicus) (Temminck and Schlegel, 1843) in \n\nAustralia (Silberschneider and Gray, 2008), South Africa (Bernatzeder and Britz, \n\n2007; Musson, 2009), and Taiwan (Ueng et al., 2007); \n\n? Corvina drum (Cilus gilberti) (Abbott, 1899) in Chile (Aburto, 2005; Augsburguer, \n\n2006; C\u00e1rdenas et al., 2009); \n\n? White croaker (Micropogonias funieri) (Demarest, 1823) in Uruguay (Garc\u00eda-Alonso \n\nand Vizziano, 2004); \n\n? Brown meagre (Sciaena umbra) (Linnaeus, 1758) in Greece (Chatzifotis et al., \n\n2006) and Turkey (Claki et al., 2006); \n\n? Red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) (Linnaeus, 1766) in China (Xu et al., 2007), \n\nEuropean Union (Henderson-Arzapalo, 1995; Holt, 2000), Ecuador (Rajoy, 2003), \n\nIsrael, Martinique (Dao, 2003; Gardes et al., 2000; Soletchnik et al., 1989), Mexico \n\n(Garc\u00eda-Ortega and Lazo, 2004; Goffings, 2010) and Taiwan (Liao and Chang, \n\n2001); \n\n? Shi drum (Umbrina cirrosa) (Linnaeus, 1758) in Cyprus (Mylonas et al., 2000), \n\nSpain (Arizcun et al., 2009), Greece (Mylonas et al., 2004), Italy (Barbaro et al., \n\n2002) and Turkey (Basaran et al., 2009); \n\n? Meagre (Argyrosomus regius) (Asso, 1801) in Spain (Mateos, 2007), Egypt, France, \n\nItaly, Morocco and Turkey (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2005). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n1.2.1 Japanese croaker (Argyrosomus japonicus) (Temminck and \n\nSchlegel, 1843): \n\n \n\nA. japonicus is a widely distributed sciaenid fish, being present in the waters of South \n\nand Central Australia, from Queensland until Western Australia, where it is known as \nmulloway, from Hong Kong northwards along the Chinese coast to southern Korea and \nJapan, and is found in the northern Indian Ocean, from Pakistan to the northwest coast of \nIndia (Griffiths and Heemstra, 1995; Bernatzeder et al., 2010). It is also present in the \n\nAfrican southeast coast, from Cape of Good Hope to southern Mozambique, where it is \nknown as dusky kob (Griffiths and Heemstra, 1995; Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2005), living until 30 \nyears old and 2 meters of total length (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2005). In Taiwan, fishermen from the \n\nPenghu Archipelago culture this species in saltwater net cages, where the maturation occurs \nat the 5-6 years of age and body length of 70-80 cm, with A. japonicus starting to emit \nsounds at the age of 6 months (Ueng et al., 2007). Adults spawn in the near-shore marine \n\nenvironment (until depths of approximately 100 m) and early juveniles (>20 mm TL) recruit \ninto estuaries and migrate to the upper reaches where salinity ranges between 0 and 5 ppm. \nEarly juveniles (<150 mm TL) appear to be restricted to the upper reaches, whereas larger \njuveniles (>150 mm TL) migrate into the middle and lower reaches of estuaries, into the surf \nzone and eventually out to sea (Griffiths, 1996; Bernatzeder et al., 2010). \n\nThe commercial production started in 1992, in the state of New South Wales (Australia) \nand since then a large number of fingerlings were successfully produced using pond \nfertilization techniques (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2005). According to the NSW Fisheries (2003), \n\nbetween 2001 and 2002, were produced 120.000 fingerlings, with a unit price of 0.56 euro \n(Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2005). A. japonicus grows at a very good rate in floating cages, around the \n\nSydney area, attaining a size of 45 cm (around 1,1kg) after 26 months of feeding, at \nenvironmental temperature, but the commercial size is between 500 and 700 grams \n(Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2005). \n\n \n\n1.2.2 Brown meagre (Sciaena umbra) (Linnaeus, 1758): \n\n \n\nBrown meagre is a demersal species living at depths of 0 to 200 m, with a wide \n\ndistribution in the Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea and eastern Atlantic Ocean (Chao, 1986). It \n\nexhibits nocturnal behavior and occupies bottom caves and sea beds covered with \n\nvegetation (Chatzifotis et al., 2006; Cakli et al., 2006). Growth is considerably repressed \n\nduring low temperatures in winter but accelerated from spring until autumn when the water \n\ntemperature rises. Females grow faster than males. The sexually mature fish spawn from \n\nMay to July producing pelagic eggs. Feeding is reduced during gonad maturation and brown \n\nmeagre may use as an energy source hepatic lipid reserves accumulated during the sexual \n\nresting period (Chatzifotis et al., 2006; Cakli et al., 2006).  \n\nTurkey is the fourth largest producer of farmed fish in the Mediterranean region, having \n\nin 2007, a fishery production of 772,471 tons and an aquaculture production of 140,021 tons, \n\nbeing the biggest producer of the 4 Candidate Countries to the EU (Zampogna, 2009). \n\nAquaculture of new commercial species, like common dentex, sharpsnout seabream, brown \n\nmeagre and red sea bream, began in 2000 with few farms and is still a successful activity \n\n(Cakli et al., 2006). The culture of brown meagre, which is being done in small-size \n\noperations, is a new pilot activity. For that reason, no studies about the quality of wild of \n\ncultured forms of this species exist in Turkey (Cakli et al., 2006). The species Sciaena \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\numbra has great potential for aquaculture in Turkey and Greece, where the Aegean \n\naquaculture industry is looking for alternative species to culture in sea cages. According to \n\nfish sellers, brown meagre obtains high prices because it is one of the preferred fish in \n\nTurkey (Cakli et al., 2006). Knowledge of the nutritional requirements of brown meagre is \n\nscarce and the only available information refers to its dietary habits in the wild, but its \n\nnutritional requirements are similar with the other Sciaenidae species (Chatzifotis et al., \n\n2006; Cakli et al., 2006). \n\n \n\n1.2.3 Red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) (Linnaeus, 1766): \n\n \n\nThe distribution of red drum ranges from Cape Cod in the north-western Atlantic Ocean \n\nto Tuxpan, Mexico in the Gulf of Mexico. Red drum or redfish (as this species is also \n\ncommonly known), usually inhabit coastal and estuarine waters. They have a characteristic \n\nred-orange color that can vary from grey to red-bronze and one or more black spots near the \n\nbase of the caudal fin. Red drum are eurythermal and euryhaline, carnivorous and of \n\nconsiderable commercial value (Lazo et al., 2010). Early juveniles feed primarily on bottom-\n\ndwelling invertebrates and later stages feed on fish, shrimp and crabs (Jim\u00e9nez et al., \n\n2005). Juveniles are found in bays and estuaries until sexually mature, except in their more \n\nnortherly range, where they move offshore or south in the winter to warmer waters. Red \n\ndrums are not tolerant to cold temperatures and death results below 10\u00b0C (Lazo et al., \n\n2010). Sexually mature adults of 3\u20135 years of age (4\u20135 kg) migrate to offshore waters and \n\nspawning takes place in shallow coastal waters during the evening from August to \n\nNovember. The maximum age documented is 56 years (1250 mm fork length, FL) for males \n\nand 52 years (1346 mm FL) for females (Lazo et al., 2010). \n\nIts aquaculture started in the 70\u2019s, when the adults of this species were induced for the \n\nbreeding in captivity, with the manipulation of the photoperiod and temperature, and the \n\nconcomitant development of the larval rearing (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2005), being the first of the \n\nSciaenidae to be farmed in a commercial way. This species adapts easily to captivity, laying \n\neggs in laboratory conditions, without the use of hormones, mainly due to good acceptance \n\nof artificial feeds and fast grow out, reaching 500 g within 9 months (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2005). \n\nThe production is made in several states along the Gulf of Mexico and south-eastern Atlantic \n\nin the USA, as well as in Taiwan, China, Mexico and several other countries in Latin America \n\n(Lazo et al., 2010). \n\n \n\n1.2.4 Meagre (Argyrosomus regius) (Asso, 1801): \n\n \n\nMeagre, Argyrosomus regius (Asso, 1801) is a teleost fish species that belongs to the \n\nSciaenidae family, being one of its largest members (Chao, 1986). Can grow more than 180 \n\ncm in total length and weight more than 50 kg (Qu\u00e9m\u00e9ner, 2002; Prista et al., 2009). Has a \n\nwide distribution, being present in the Mediterranean and Black seas, Atlantic coast of \n\nEurope and west coast of Africa, living in inshore or coastal waters, close to the bottom or \n\nnear the surface (range depths from 15 to 200 m) (Cabral and Ohmert, 2001; Poli et al., \n\n2003; El-Shebly et al., 2007). For a few years that it\u2019s being proposed as a candidate for the \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nMediterranean aquaculture diversification (Qu\u00e9m\u00e9ner, 2002; El-Shebly et al., 2007; \n\nChatzifotis et al., 2011), due to its fast growth, flesh quality and high nutritional value (regius \n\nfor royal quality of flesh) (Poli et al., 2003; Piccolo et al., 2008; Chatzifotis et al., 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 \u2013 Morphological characteristics of meagre. In Monfort (2010). \n\n \n\nIn terms of fisheries, the largest ones were recorded in Africa, where Mauritania, \n\nMorocco and Egypt are responsible for around 80% of the 10 000 t world annual catch \n\n(Qu\u00e9m\u00e9ner, 2002; FAO, 2009; Prista et al., 2009). In Europe, annual values of meagre \n\nlandings are bellow 500 t, and in Portugal, has a secondary importance (FAO, 2009; Prista \n\net al., 2009), only being very appreciated in the south region Algarve. Nevertheless, meagre \n\nis a large sized fish, can attain high ex-vessel prices and high seasonal availability (Qu\u00e9ro \n\nand Vayne, 1987; Prista et al., 2009), making it a species of great interest for the \n\naquaculture production (Qu\u00e9m\u00e9ner, 2002; Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2005; Prista et al., 2009). Adding \n\nto those characteristics, it\u2019s a specie that tolerates wide ranges of salinity, temperature and \n\ncan be reared in brackish water ponds (El-Shebly et al., 2007), being ideal for the \n\naquaculture industry. \n\nNowadays, the life cycle is already closed, with many hatcheries spread throughout \n\nEurope, and successful grow out in cages or ponds in Mediterranean countries like Greece, \n\nFrance, Italy, Spain and Egypt (Poli et al., 2003; El-Shebly et al., 2007; Chatzifotis et al., \n\n2011). \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1.2 \u2013 Production cycle of meagre. In Monfort (2010). \n\n \n\nIn spite of rearing techniques for the different stages are well established, production \n\nhas not yet reached its full potencial (Mart\u00ednez-Llorenz et al., 2011), mainly because of the \n\nfeeding protocols, since the techniques used are the same for others species,  with well \n\nknown needs in terms of nutrients. \n\nMeagre is a carnivorous species and in the wild, it feeds on Mysidacea, Decapoda and \n\nTeleostei (Qu\u00e9ro and Vayne, 1987; Cabral and Ohmert, 2001; Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2005; \n\nChatzifotis et al., 2011), but under culture conditions, the feeding protocols used nowadays \n\nare based on the pelleted diets used for sea bream (Sparus aurata) and sea bass \n\n(Dicentrarchus labrax) (Roo et al., 2010; Chatzifotis et al., 2011; Mart\u00ednez-Llorenz et al., \n\n2011), being inaddequate for this species. Since the necessary dietary requirements for \n\nlipids and proteins, that allow to attain the high grow rates for meagre, around 1 kg in less \n\nthan 1 year in cages (Qu\u00e9m\u00e9ner, 2002; Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2005; Roo et al., 2010; Chatzifotis \n\net al., 2011), are not well know, there is the need of further study to establish the ratio \n\nprotein:lipid, creating new feeds and feeding protocols (Roo et al., 2010), that may be able to \n\nfulfill the propose of maximizing growth with the optimum feed, putting a less and less \n\nmonetary effort on feeds and making possible to reach the full grow potential of this species. \n\nIn terms of market value, Argyrosomus regius can attain a price from 6 to 10 \u20ac/Kg for \n\nwhole fish (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2005; Monfort, 2010) and 10-15\u20ac/kg for fillets (Monfort, 2010), \n\nmaking it a very desirable commercial product (Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2009). The more versatile \n\na fish can be, in terms of processing and forms of sale, makes it more profitable and worth \n\ninvesting (Figure 1.3). Meagre stands for \u201clow fat fish\u201d (from the French maigre = slim) \n\n(Monfort, 2010), and the amount of muscular fat is very low, compared with other \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\naquaculture species (Poli et al., 2003), making possible the fillet preservation under \n\nrefrigeration for longer periods of time, meeting the new lifestyles habits among people: less \n\ntime to cook and preference for processed products (Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2009). Many other \n\nforms are possible, like smoked fish and sushi, since meagre has a firm white flesh, that \n\nkeeps it shape after cooking, and with the appropriate marketing, the future looks promising \n\n(Monfort, 2010). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3 \u2013 Schematic description of the European retail market for fresh fish portions by \n\nconsumers\u2019 prices categories. In Monfort (2010). \n\n \n\n1.3 Nutritional requirements of meagre: \n\n \n\nMeagre is categorized as a fish with low fat content (Poli et al., 2003), with lipid \n\ncontent less than 5%.total weight\n-1\n\n and protein content between 10 and 20%.total weight\n-1\n\n \n\n(C\u00e1rdenas, 2010) (Table 1.2), but little information exists about the exact interval of dietary \n\nrequirements for lipids and proteins that can be used for the formulation of specialized diets \n\nfor this species. It is established that the level of protein should be superior to 45% and the \n\nlevel of lipids should not exceed 17% (C\u00e1rdenas, 2010), with many authors researching \n\nwithin or close to this range of values (Poli et al., 2003; Chatzifotis et al., 2011; Grigorakis \n\net al., 2011; Mart\u00ednez-Lorenz et al., 2011). Woolley et al. (2010) refer that the level of \n\nprotein to be included in feeds should be from 42% to 46%. \n\n \n\nTable 1.2 \u2013 Muscle fillet contents in fat and protein, from aquaculture reared meagre. \n\nAdapted from C\u00e1rdenas (2010). \n\n \n\nFish weight (g) Fat (% total weight) Protein (% total weight) \n\n195 1,7 20,9 \n\n357-385 0,3-0,6 N.D. \n\n665-776 2,4-3,6 20,9-21,1 \n\n936-1.503 2,1-2,9 N.D. \n\n2.370 2,49 19,8 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\nThese macronutrients provide the required energy, the essential amino acids and the \n\nessential fatty acids for growth (Chatzifotis et al., 2011). Their relative inclusion in diets \n\ndetermines fish growth and the economic performance of aqua feeds, as the proper energy \n\nto protein ratio in the diet contributes to the effective utilization of dietary proteins, through \n\nthe protein sparing effect on fish (Watanabe, 1982; Chatzifotis et al., 2011). The level of \n\ndietary lipids that fish can use is limited, and beyond the point of optimal lipid intake, growth \n\nmay be retarded, due to reduction in feed consumption, and body fat may increase, affecting \n\nthe carcass quality (Chatzifotis et al., 2011). The lipids are mainly supplied through the \n\ninclusion of fish oils that contain the necessary amount of fatty acids. \n\n \n\n1.3.1 Macronutrients \n\n1.3.1.1 Proteins: \n\n \n\nProteins are the most abundant compounds in living organisms and have fundamental \n\nroles in all biological processes. They are organic molecules that contain carbon, hydrogen, \n\noxygen, nitrogen and frequently sulfur. The basic composition of most proteins is very \n\nsimilar, with varying percentages of its components: 50-55% carbon, 20-23% oxygen, 15-\n\n18% nitrogen, 6-8% hydrogen, and from 0 to 4% sulfur (Jobling, 1995), being composed of \n\nup to 20 ?-amino acids linked into chains by peptide bonds. The chains are cross-linked by \n\ndisulfide bridges, hydrogen bonds, and Van der Waals forces (NRC, 1993). The amino acid \n\ncontent of proteins, particularly feed proteins, may differ markedly, so the protein nutritional \n\nquality derives from the content, proportion and availability of amino acids (Becker, 2007). \n\nIn the context of animal feeding, protein generally refers to crude protein (CP); that is, \n\nN \u00d7 6.25, a definition based on the assumption that proteins contain 16% N. The requirement \n\nfor dietary protein has two components: \n\n1. a need for indispensable amino acids that the fish cannot synthesize either at all \n\nor at a rate commensurate with its need for protein deposition or commensurate \n\nwith the synthesis of a variety of other compounds with metabolic functions and \n\n2. a supply of either dispensable amino acids or sufficient amino nitrogen to enable \n\nthe fish to synthesize them. \n\nInsofar as synthesis of dispensable amino acids requires expenditure of energy, \n\nfeeding dietary proteins that most nearly meet the needs of fish for both indispensable and \n\ndispensable amino acids, will result in the most efficient growth by the fish (Thoman et al., \n\n1999; Chatzifotis et al., 2011). Dietary protein constitutes one of the primary nutrient costs \n\nof the feed and is the initial source of nitrogen waste products entering a culture system. \n\nConsequently, optimization of dietary protein levels along with increasing nutrient retention \n\nby the fish could reduce nitrogen loading and positively influence production costs (Mohanta \n\net al., 2007), both from an economical and an environmental perspective. To minimize feed \n\ncosts, it is important to optimize both dietary protein level and utilization by the fish (Thoman \n\net al., 1999), and include carbohydrates and lipids. \n\nThe amount of protein to be included in a fish diet is influenced by protein to energy \n\nratio (P:E), protein digestibility and amount of non-protein energy in the diet (NRC, 1993; \n\nMohanta et al., 2007). When insufficient non-protein energy is available in the feed, dietary \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nprotein is delaminated in the body to supply energy rather than being used for tissue growth \n\nand protein synthesis. The liver plays a major role in directing the various nutrients to specific \n\norgans and tissues to be metabolized for energy (Li et al., 2012). The same basic metabolic \n\npathways for converting amino acids, carbohydrates and lipid into energy have been \n\nobserved in fish as in terrestrial animals (NRC, 1993). It is preferable for dietary \n\ncarbohydrates or lipid to be metabolized for energy so that protein (amino acids) can be used \n\nfor tissue synthesis. To ensure this, there must be a proper balance of dietary protein to \n\nenergy to optimize fish growth and lean tissue accretion. Energy-to-protein ratios ranging \n\nfrom 8 to 10 kcal of digestible energy/g (DE/g) of protein (33 to 42 kJ/g) are optimal for \n\nvarious fish species (Gatlin III, 2010).  \n\nConsidering this, much research has been conducted to investigate the protein-sparing \n\npotential of lipids and carbohydrates in fish diets. In their natural environment, fish have \n\nlimited access to carbohydrates and are better adapted both at digestive and metabolic \n\nlevels to utilize protein and lipids than carbohydrates as energy sources (Li et al., 2012). So, \n\na supplementation of lipids rather than carbohydrates as a non-protein energy source is \n\ngenerally a more effective method to increase dietary energy level because lipids are energy-\n\ndense nutrients and are readily metabolized by fish (NRC, 1993). In meagre, the protein-\n\nsparing effect can be investigated through the optimization of the dietary ratio protein:lipid.  \n\n \n\n1.3.1.2 Lipids: \n\n \n\nLipids constitute a heterogenic family of compounds with diverse structures. Their \n\ncommon and defining feature is their insolubility in water and solubility in organic solvents \n\n(ether, acetone, mixture of chloroform-alcohol). The terms \"fats\" and \"oils\" are used to define \n\nmixtures of lipids, respectively solids or liquids at room temperature (Nelson and Cox, \n\n2004). \n\nThe lipids present in teleost fish species may be divided into two major groups: the \n\nphospholipids and the triglycerides (Gunstone et al., 2007). The phospholipids make up the \n\nintegral structure of the unit membranes in the cells; thus, they are often called structural \n\nlipids. The triglycerides are lipids used for storage of energy in fat depots, usually within \n\nspecial fat cells surrounded by a phospholipid membrane and a rather weak collagen \n\nnetwork, being formed by the combining of glycerol with three molecules of fatty acids. The \n\ntriglycerides are often termed depot fat. A few fish have wax esters as part of their depot fats \n\n(Huss, 1995). \n\nThe phospholipids are all contained in membrane structures, including the outer cell \n\nmembrane, the endoplasmic reticulum and other intracellular tubule systems, as well as \n\nmembranes of the organelles like mitochondria. In addition to phospholipids, the membranes \n\nalso contain cholesterol, contributing to the membrane rigidity. In lean fish muscle cholesterol \n\nmay be found in a quantity of about 6 % of the total lipids (Huss, 1995; Chatzifotis et al., \n\n2010). The fat cells making up the lipid depots in fatty species are typically located in the \n\nsubcutaneous tissue, in the belly flap muscle and in the muscles moving the fins and tail \n\n(Huss, 1995). \n\nFat depots are also typically found spread throughout the muscle structure. The \n\nconcentration of fat cells appears to be highest close to the myocommata and in the region \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nbetween the light and dark muscle (Huss, 1995). The dark muscle contains some \n\ntriglycerides inside the muscle cells even in lean fish, as this muscle is able to metabolize \n\nlipids directly as energy. The corresponding light muscle cells are dependent on glycogen as \n\na source of energy for the anaerobic metabolism (Huss, 1995; Chatzifotis et al., 2010). To \n\nbest fulfill the needs in lipids for optimal development and growth, oils derived from fish are \n\nused. \n\n \n\n1.3.1.2.1 Fish oils: \n\nFish oils contain a wide range of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated \n\nacids (Table 1.3), but fish fatty acid (FA) composition is generally cited in terms of the major \n\nacids only. Such oils are rich in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) (mainly myristic and palmitic), \n\nmonounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) covering the range of hexadecenoic through \n\ndocosenoic, and omega-3 (n-3) C20 and C22 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (Gunstone \n\net al., 2007). These last are very important acids for which fish oils are the largest source, \n\nsupplying eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids. The fish oils vary in \n\nthe level of combined PUFA\u2019s and also in the distribution between EPA and DHA. This is \n\nimportant when selecting a fish oil as a source of one or other of these PUFA for \n\nenhancement and when seeking a dietary source rich in one of these acids, but not in the \n\nother. \n\n \n\nTable 1.3 \u2013 Fatty acids identified in fish oils. Adapted from Gunstone et al. (2007). \n\n \n\nAcid type Number of carbon atoms \n\nSaturated \u2013 straight chain 12, 14-24 odd and even members \n\nSaturated \u2013 branched \nchain \n\n15, 17, 18, 19 \n\nMonounsaturated 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24 \n\nPolyunsaturated 16:2-4, 18:2-4, 20:2-5, 21:5, and 22:3-6 \n\nNote: Many of the unsaturated acids occur in several forms. \n\n \n\nFish oils contain materials with valuable dietary and pharmaceutical properties as well \n\nas having physical properties that make them useful as moisturizers. Until the 1960s, fish \n\nliver oils were used in Europe and the U.S. mainly for their vitamins A and D, but high-quality \n\nfish oil is now used as a source of long-chain (n-3) fatty acids (Simopoulos, 2002; \n\nGunstone et al., 2007; Chatzifotis et al., 2010). \n\n \n\n1.3.1.2.2 Fatty acids: \n\nFatty acids are simple organic compounds constituted by carbon, hydrogen and \n\noxygen with long hydrocarbon chains of various lengths (4 to 36 carbons long) (Christie, \n\n1989; Gunstone et al., 2007). Each molecule of fatty acid has in the end of its chain a \n\ncarboxylic group and in the opposite a non-functional methyl group. Fatty acids are divided \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\ninto groups according to chain length, number, position and configuration of their double \n\nbonds, and the occurrence of additional functional groups along the chains (Christie, 1989). \n\nFatty acids systematic name is derived from the name of its parent hydrocarbon substituting \n\nthe end e with oic. For example, the C18 saturated fatty acid is called octadecanoic acid since \n\nthe parent hydrocarbon is octadecane. A C18 fatty acid with one double bond is called \n\noctadecenoic acid; with two double bounds (\"di\"), octadecadienoic acid; with three double \n\nbonds (\"tri\"), octadecatrieenoic acid (Simopoulos, 2002) (Table 1.4). \n\n \n\nTable 1.4 - Structure, systematic, trivial, and shorthand names of some common fatty acids, \n\nwith (n-3) FA marked in red and (n-6) FA marked in blue. Adapted from Gunstone et al. \n\n(2007). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe n- or \u201comega\u201d nomenclature is used to describe fatty acids by the general formula \n\nX:Yn-z, where X is the carbon chain length, Y is the number of ethylenic/double bonds, and \n\nn-z (or ?z) denotes the position of the first double bond relative to the methyl end of the fatty \n\nacid. Thus, 16:0 denotes a saturated fatty acid containing 16 carbons and no double bonds \n\n(all carbons saturated with hydrogen), and 18:1n-9 (18:1?9) designates a monounsaturated \n\nfatty acid with 18 carbon atoms and a single double bond that is nine carbon atoms from the \n\nmethyl end. Many freshwater fish can elongate and desaturate 18-carbon linolenic acid with \n\nthree double bonds to longer chains (20 and 22 carbons) of more highly unsaturated fatty \n\nacids (HUFAs) with five or six double bonds. In contrast, most marine fish must have HUFA \n\nin the diet (Gatlin III, 2010). In the body, HUFAs are components of cell membranes (in the \n\nform of phosphoglycerides, or phospholipids), especially in neural tissues of the brain and \n\neye. They also serve as precursors of steroid hormones and the highly active eicosanoids \n\nproduced from 20-carbon HUFAs. Carbon atoms 2 and 3 are often referred to as ? and ?, \n\nrespectively, and the methyl carbon atom at the distal end of the chain is called the ?-\n\ncarbon. (Christie, 1989; Gunstone et al., 2007) Fatty acids are named as saturated fatty \n\nacids (SFA) when they do not contain double bonds and monounsaturated fatty acids \n\n(MUFA) when they contain one double bond. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) possess \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nmore than one double bond. Many may be present at levels exceeding 10%: SFAs (14:0, \n\n16:0), MUFAs (16:1, 18:1, 20:1, 22:1) and (n-3) PUFAs (20:5, 22:6). Many minor fatty acids \n\nare also present (Gunstone et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n1.3.1.2.3 Saturated fatty acids: \n\nSFAs form a homologous series of monocarboxylic acids (CnH2n+1COOH). Naturally \n\noccurring saturated acids are mainly of even chain length between C4 and C24. Odd chain \n\nacids are usually minor or trace components of plant and animal lipids (Christie, 1989). \n\nPalmitic acid (16:0) is the most abundant and widespread natural SFA, present in plants, \n\nanimals, and microorganisms. Levels of 20 to 30% are common in animal lipids, 10 to 40% in \n\nseed oils (Das, 2006). Stearic acid (18:0) is also ubiquitous, usually at low levels, but is \n\nabundant in cocoa butter (around 34%) and some animal fats, e.g., lard (5 to 24%) and beef \n\ntallow (6 to 40%) (Gunstone et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n1.3.1.2.4 Monoenoic fatty acids: \n\nStraight-chain, cis-monoenoic acids with an even number of carbons are common \n\nconstituents of many lipids and commodity oils. Trans- monoenes are rare components of \n\nnatural oils and fats. The cis (Z) double bond is usually inserted by a ?9-desaturase enzyme \n\ninto preformed saturated acids; this may be followed by two-carbon chain extension at the \n\ncarboxyl end. Starting with 16:0, this results in (n-7) monoenes, while desaturation of 18:0 \n\nleads to the (n-9) family (Christie, 1989; Gunstone et al., 2007). The most common \n\nmonoene is oleic acid (18:1 9c) (Figure 1.4).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.4 \u2013 Oleic acid representation. In Gunstone et al. (2007). \n\n \n\nOleic acid is found in most plant and animal lipids and is the major fatty acid in olive \n\noil (70 to 75%) and several nut oils, e.g., macadamia, pistachio, pecan, almond, and hazelnut \n\n(filbert) contain 50 to over 70%. Palmitoleic acid (16:1 9c, (n-7)) is a ubiquitous minor \n\ncomponent in animal lipids, somewhat more abundant in fish oils. C20 monoenes (9c and 11c) \n\nisomers are found in fish oils (Das, 2006). \n\n \n\n1.3.1.2.5 Methylene-interrupted polyunsaturated acids: \n\nMarine fish contain large amounts of 22:6(n-3) and 20:5(n-3) in the phospholipids of \n\ntheir cellular membranes. Marine fish can neither biosynthesize 22:6(n-3) de novo nor from \n\nshorter chain precursors such as 18:3(n-3). Therefore, 22:6(n-3) and 20:5(n-3) are essential \n\ndietary constituents for marine fish (Sargent et al., 1999). Most unsaturated fatty acids with \n\ntwo or more double bonds show a characteristic methylene interrupted pattern of \n\nunsaturation, with one CH2 between cis double bonds. This pattern results from the operation \n\nof a few specific desaturases and chain-elongation enzymes. Plants generally insert double \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\nbonds at the ?9, ?12, and ?15 positions in C18 fatty acids, giving (n-9), (n-6), and (n-3) \n\ncompounds, respectively (Das, 2006). Animals can also insert double bonds at the ?9 \n\nposition, but not at ?12 or ?15; instead, further double bonds are introduced between the \n\ncarboxyl group and the ?9 position by ?5 and ?6 desaturase enzymes and the chain can \n\nthen be extended in two carbon units at the carboxyl end of the molecule (Gunstone et al., \n\n2007). The resulting (n-6) and (n-3) polyenes are shown in Figure 1.5:  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.5 - Biosynthesis of (n-6) and (n-3) polyenes (D = desaturase, E = elongase, -2C = \n\ntwo-carbon chain shortening). In Gunstone et al. (2007). \n\n \n\nThe step leading to DHA is usually the net result of two elongations, a ?6 desaturase \n\nand subsequent two-carbon chain shortening. Along with a few saturates (mainly 16:0 and \n\n18:0, but also 10:0 to 14:0) and oleic acid, the (n-6) and (n-3) polyenes make up the fatty \n\nacids found in most plants, animals, and commodity oils and fats (Das, 2006). \n\nLinoleic acid (LA, 18:2(n-6)) (Figure 1.6) is present in most plant oils and is abundant \n\n(>50%) in corn, sunflower, and soybean oils, and exceeds 70% in safflower oil (Gunstone et \n\nal., 2007). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.6 \u2013 Linoleic acid representation. In Gunstone et al. (2007). \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\nArachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4(n-6)) (Figure 1.7) is present in animal tissues, but do \n\nnot usually accumulate at significant levels in storage fats, being the precursor of the PG2 \n\nprostaglandin family (Gunstone et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.7 \u2013 Arachidonic acid representation. In Gunstone et al. (2007). \n\n \n\nAlfa (?) - linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3(n-3)) is ubiquitous in plant leaf lipids and is present \n\nin several commodity seed oils: 8 to 10% in soybean and canola, >50% in linseed oil, and 65 \n\nto 75% of perilla oil (Gunstone et al., 2007).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.8 \u2013 ?-linolenic acid representation. In Gunstone et al. (2007). \n\n \n\nThe (n-3) long-chain, polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) eicosapentaenoic acid \n\n(EPA, 20:5 \u2013 CH3CH2CH=CH(CH2CH=CH)4CH2CH2CH2COOH) (Figure 1.9), and \n\ndocosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 \u2013 CH3CH2CH=CH(CH2CH=CH)5CH2CH2COOH) (Figure \n\n1.10), are important nutritionally and are mainly obtained from oily fish and fish oils where \n\nthey are present at levels from 5 to 20% (Das, 2006). EPA is the precursor of the PG3 \n\nprostaglandin series (Gunstone et al., 2007).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.9 \u2013 Eicosapentaenoic acid representation. In Gunstone et al. (2007). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.10 \u2013 Docosahexaenoic acid representation. In Gunstone et al. (2007). \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\nSometimes the total level of (n-3) EPA and DHA is important and on other occasions it \n\nis desirable to have high concentrations of only one of them. Sometimes it is desirable to \n\nhave these acids at higher concentrations than is provided naturally or to enrich one of them \n\nat the expense of the other. Alternatively, it may be desired to incorporate one or both of \n\nthem into an oil rich in medium-chain acids (Das, 2006; Gunstone et al., 2007). The \n\nAmerican Heart Association recommends combined intakes of EPA and DHA of 1 g/day for \n\npatients with known coronary heart disease (CHD) and 0.5 g/day for individuals without \n\nknown CHD (Simopoulos, 2002; Das, 2006; Gunstone et al., 2007). The characteristic fatty \n\nacids of the fat of fish possess antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory characteristics, justifying \n\na lower prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in fish-eating populations (Simopoulos, 2002; \n\nDas, 2006). In human nutrition, FA such as LA and ALA are regarded as essential since they \n\ncannot be synthesized by the organism. In marine fish, these fatty acids constitute only \n\naround 2 % of the total lipids, which is a small percentage compared with many vegetable \n\noils (Simopoulos, 2002). However, fish oils contain other PUFAs which are \"essential\" to \n\nprevent skin diseases in the same way as LA and ARA (Das, 2006). As members of the \n\nlinolenic acid family (first double bond in the third position, (n-3) counted from the terminal \n\nmethyl group), they will also have neurological benefits in growing children (Huss, 1995; \n\nDas, 2006; Simopoulos, 2002). Poli et al. (2003) determined that the flesh of meagre has a \n\nfatty acid profile similar to other Mediterranean marine fish (C\u00e1rdenas, 2010) (Table 1.5). \n\nBecause of these fatty acids contents, meagre possesses anti-atherogenic and \n\nantithrombotic properties, measured by indexes. These indexes reflect quantitatively the \n\npotential of fats to increase aggression in the vascular endothelium, to produce thrombosis or \n\nembolism in subjects sensitive to these conditions. These indexes in meagre are much lower \n\nthan those posed by ground meat (lamb, beef, pork) (Poli et al., 2003; Piccolo et al., 2008).  \n\n \n\nTable 1.5 \u2013 Fatty acids contents (%) of fishes reared in aquaculture.

The percentage of PUFA with four, five or six double bonds is slightly \n\nlower in the PUFA of lipids from freshwater fish (approximately 70%) than in the \n\ncorresponding lipids from marine fish (approximately 88%) (Huss, 1995). However, the \n\ncomposition of the lipids is not completely fixed but can vary with the feed intake and season. \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\nMaintaining high levels of (n-3) PUFA, as well as low levels of (n-6) fatty acids, in farmed \n\nfish, is considered desirable to provide a high nutritional value product for human \n\nconsumption (Das, 2006; Martins et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n1.3.1.3 Carbohydrates: \n\n \n\nCarnivorous species, such as meagre, are very efficient using dietary protein and lipid \n\nfor energy but less efficient at using dietary carbohydrates (Li et al., 2012). The feeds that \n\ncarnivorous species eat contain little carbohydrate, so they use this nutrient less efficiently. \n\nFish do not have a specific dietary requirement for carbohydrates, but including these \n\ncompounds in diets is an inexpensive source of energy (Gatlin III, 2010).  Carbohydrates \n\nmay serve as precursors for the dispensable amino acids and nucleic acids, which are \n\nmetabolic intermediates necessary for growth (NRC, 1993). The ability of fish to utilize \n\ndietary carbohydrates for energy varies considerably; many carnivorous species use them \n\nless efficiently than do herbivorous and omnivorous species. Some carbohydrates are \n\ndeposited in the form of glycogen in tissues such as liver and muscle, where it is a ready \n\nsource of energy. Some dietary carbohydrates are converted to lipid and deposited in the \n\nbody for energy (NRC, 1993; Gatlin III, 2010). Since fish can\u2019t digest complex carbohydrates \n\n(cellulose and other fibrous carbohydrates), the amount of crude fiber in fish feeds is usually \n\nless than 7% of the diet, to limit the amount of undigested material entering the culture \n\nsystem. Cereal grains serve as inexpensive sources of carbohydrates for warm-water fish, \n\nbut their use in cold-water fish feeds is limited (NRC, 1993). \n\nSoluble carbohydrates such as starch are primary energy reserves found in seeds, \n\ntubers and other plant structures. Animal tissues such as liver and muscle contain small \n\nconcentrations of soluble carbohydrate in the form of glycogen, which is structurally similar to \n\nstarch (Gatlin III, 2010). This glycogen reserve can be rapidly mobilized when the body \n\nneeds glucose. Prepared feeds for carnivorous fish usually contain less than 20% soluble \n\ncarbohydrate, while feeds for omnivorous species usually contain 25 to 45%. In addition to \n\nbeing a source of energy, starch in fish feeds also gives pellets integrity and stability and \n\nmakes them less dense (NRC, 1993). Because carbohydrates are the least expensive \n\nsource of dietary energy, the maximum tolerable concentration should be used with regard to \n\nthe fish species.  \n\n \n\n1.3.2 Micronutrients: \n\n1.3.2.1 Vitamins: \n\n \n\nFifteen vitamins are essential for terrestrial animals and for several fish species that \n\nhave been examined to date (Table 1.6).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\nTable 1.6 \u2013 Vitamins and some of their major functions as established in fish. In Gatlin III \n\n(2010). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nVitamins are organic compounds required in relatively small concentrations to support \n\nspecific structural or metabolic functions. Vitamins are divided into two groups based on \n\nsolubility (NRC, 1993). Fat-soluble vitamins include vitamin A (retinol), vitamin D \n\n(cholecalciferol), vitamin E (?-tocopherol) and vitamin K. These fat-soluble vitamins are \n\nmetabolized and deposited in association with body lipids, so fish can go for long periods \n\nwithout having these vitamins in the diet before they show signs of deficiency (Gatlin III, \n\n2010). Water-soluble vitamins include ascorbic acid (vitamin C), biotin, choline, folic acid, \n\ninositol, niacin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, riboflavin, thiamin and vitamin B12. They are not \n\nstored in appreciable amounts in the body, so signs of deficiency usually appear within \n\nweeks in young, rapidly growing fish (Gatlin III, 2010). Most of these water-soluble vitamins \n\nare components of coenzymes that have specific metabolic functions. Vitamin premixes are \n\nnow available to add to prepared diets so that fish receive adequate levels of each vitamin \n\nindependent of levels in dietary ingredients. This gives producers a margin of safety for \n\nlosses associated with processing and storage. The stability of vitamins during feed \n\nmanufacture and storage has been improved over the years with protective coatings and/or \n\nchemical modifications. Therefore, vitamin deficiencies are rarely observed in commercial \n\nproduction (Gatlin III, 2010). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\n1.3.2.2 Minerals: \n\n \n\nMinerals consist of inorganic elements the body requires for various purposes. Fish \n\nrequire the same minerals as terrestrial animals for tissue formation, osmoregulation and \n\nother metabolic functions. However, dissolved minerals in the water may satisfy some of the \n\nmetabolic requirements of fish (Gatlin III, 2010). Minerals are typically classified as either \n\nmacro- or microminerals, based on the quantities required in the diet and stored in the body. \n\nMacrominerals are calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, chloride, sodium, potassium and \n\nsulfur. Dietary deficiencies of most macrominerals have been difficult to produce in fish \n\nbecause of the uptake of waterborne ions by the gills (Gatlin III, 2010). However, it is known \n\nthat phosphorus is the most critical macromineral in fish diets because there is little \n\nphosphorus in water. Because excreted phosphorus influences the eutrophication of water, \n\nmuch research has been focused on phosphorus nutrition with the aim of minimizing \n\nphosphorus excretion (NRC, 1993; Li et al., 2012) Phosphorus is a major constituent of hard \n\ntissues such as bone and scales and is also present in various biochemicals. Impaired \n\ngrowth and feed efficiency, as well as reduced tissue mineralization and impaired skeletal \n\nformation in juvenile fish, are common symptoms when fish have diets deficient in \n\nphosphorus (Gatlin III, 2010). Chloride, sodium and potassium are important electrolytes \n\ninvolved in osmoregulation and the acid\u2013base balance in the body. These minerals are usu-\n\nally abundant in water and practical feedstuffs. Magnesium is involved in intra- and \n\nextracellular homeostasis and in cellular respiration (Gatlin III, 2010). It also is abundant in \n\nmost feedstuffs. The microminerals (also known as trace minerals) include cobalt, chromium, \n\ncopper, iodine, iron, manganese, selenium and zinc (Table 1.7).  \n\n \n\nTable 1.7 \u2013 Trace minerals and some of their functions. In Gatlin III (2010). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nImpaired growth and poor feed efficiency are not readily induced with micro mineral \n\ndeficiencies, but may occur after an extended period of feeding deficient diets (Gatlin III, \n\n2010). Copper, iron, manganese, selenium and zinc are the most important to supplement in \n\ndiets because practical feedstuffs contain low levels of these microminerals and because \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\ninteractions with other dietary components may reduce their bioavailability (Gatlin III, 2010). \n\nAlthough it is not usually necessary to supplement practical diets with other microminerals, \n\nan inexpensive trace mineral premix can be added to nutritionally complete diets to ensure \n\nan adequate trace mineral content. \n\n \n\n1.4 OBJECTIVES: \n\n \n\nNowadays, there are no specific feeds for meagre. A 12 weeks feeding trial was \n\nundertaken to assess the effect of controlled dietary changes in terms of protein:lipid ratios \n\non the growth performance, nutrient utilization and whole-body composition of juvenile \n\nmeagre. Moreover, the effect of the various dietary treatments on fat deposition (liver and \n\nmuscle) and the fillet fatty acid profile was also characterized.    \n\n2 MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n2.1 Experimental diets: \n\n \n\nFive isoenergetic (21.92\u00b10.57 MJ/kg mean gross energy) extruded diets were \n\nformulated by SPAROS, Lda. (Loul\u00e9, Portugal), a commercial feed company, to provide two \n\ndietary protein levels of 44% and 50%, and three dietary lipid levels of 12%, 15% and 18%. \n\nAccording to those levels, the feeds were named 44L15, 44L18, 50L12, 50L15 and 50L18, \n\nwith first number being %crude protein and second number %crude fat. Ingredients and \n\nproximate composition (Table 2.1) of the experimental diets were assessed by SPAROS, \n\nLda.  \n\n \n\nTable 2.1 - Formulation and proximate composition of the experimental diets.

All feeds, and \n\naccording to the value of crude protein and/or crude fat, had approximated values for \n\nessential amino acids and fatty acids (Table 2.2), to avoid any undesired unbalance. All \n\ningredients were finely ground, mixed and extruded (3 mm pellets) by means of pilot-scale \n\ntwin-screw extruder (CLEXTRAL BC45, France) with a screw diameter of 55.5 mm and \n\ntemperature ranging 108-114\u00baC. Upon extrusion, all batches of extruded feeds were dried in \n\na convection oven (LTE OP 750-UF, England) for 4 hours at 50\u00baC. Following drying, pellets \n\nwere allowed to cool at room temperature. Subsequently, the fish oil was applied by coating \n\nin a vacuum mixer (DINNISEN, PG-10VCLAB, The Netherlands). During the trial, all \n\nexperimental diets were stored at room temperature, but in a cool and aerated emplacement. \n\n \n\nTable 2.2 \u2013 Detailed amino acid profile (%) and summarized fatty acid composition (% dry \n\nfeed) of experimental diets.

All animal protocols were performed under license of Group-1 from the Dire\u00e7\u00e3o-\n\nGeral de Veterin\u00e1ria, Minist\u00e9rio da Agricultura, do Desenvolvimento Rural e das Pescas \n\n(Portugal). \n\nThe trial was conducted at the Aquaculture Research Station of IPMA in Olh\u00e3o \n\n(Portugal), from September 2011 to December 2011 (63 days), with meagre juveniles bred in \n\ncaptivity at the station. 945 fish (63.66\u00b12.78 g) were randomly distributed into fifteen 1500 L \n\nfiberglass tanks (64 fish per tank and each treatment in triplicate) and allowed 1 week for \n\nacclimation to experimental conditions before the beginning of the trial. The water was \n\nsupplied in a flow-through system, with continuous aeration, and physicochemical \n\nparameters were measured and registered daily, until the end of the trial (36 g L-1 salinity, \n\noxygen saturation > 80% and average temperature of 19.8\u00b10.29 \u00b0C). Each tank had a stock \n\ndensity of 2.67 Kg/m\n3\n and received 24 hours of light (dim and natural). The light intensity was \n\nmeasured using the light meter TES 1335, at 11h15, on the first day of the trial, and all tanks \n\nhad similar values of light intensity. Triplicate groups of fish were hand fed until apparent \n\nsatiety (ad libitum), twice daily (09h00 and 16h00 weekdays, 9h00 and 13h00 weekends), \n\nand the feed consumption was recorded daily.  \n\n \n\n2.3 Sampling methods: \n\n \n\nA total of four samplings were made: one in the beginning of the trial, two intermediate, \n\nand one final. \n\nIn the initial one, all fish were individually weighed and measured, and then returned to \n\nthe tank of origin. At the beginning of the trial, 15 fish (one from each tank) were sacrificed, \n\nindividually weighed and stored at ? 80 \u00b0C for subsequent whole body composition \n\ndetermination (moisture, protein, lipid, energy and ash). For quantification of food intake, and \n\nduring the week before the intermediate and final samplings, all the feeds that fish wouldn\u2019t \n\neat were collected and weighed, so waste could be quantified. The excess food was \n\ncollected from the bottom of the tank through suction and two hours after the last feeding. \n\nThe collected feeds would be hydrated, so a correcting factor was applied (Table 2.3). To \n\nobtain the correcting factor, 5 replicates of 20 g of each feed were immersed in 1 L of water \n\n(temperature equal to trial tanks) for 2 hours. Applying the correcting factor to the daily \n\nregistered values of feed consumption, subtracted by the non ingested feed, would give the \n\ndaily feed consumption per tank.  \n\n \n\nTable 2.3 \u2013 Hydration factor calculated for each dietary treatment (mean\u00b1SD). \n\n \n\nFeeds 50L12 50L15 50L18 44L15 44L18 \n\nHydration factor 2.2\u00b12.0 1.92\u00b10.8 1.72\u00b11.0 1.92\u00b10.8 1.92\u00b11.4 \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\nAfter the week where collection of hydrated feeds took place and prior to the \n\nintermediate samples, fish were fasted for 24 h, and then, in groups of 10 from each tank, \n\nthey were counted and weighed individually, and then returned to the tank of origin. \n\nAt the end of the trial and after the fast of 24 h, twelve fish from each tank were \n\nrandomly chosen and anesthetized with 2-phenoxyethanol (0,15 ml.L\n-1\n\n). All 12 fish were \n\nsacrificed, measured and weighed individually (bench scale Kern &amp; Sohn Gmbh, model ITB \n\n35K1IP, readout 1 g). From those 12 fish, six were stored at -20 \u00b0C for whole body \n\ncomposition; from the other six fish, liver and viscera weights were recorded for \n\nhepatosomatic and visceral index determination, and frozen at -80 \u00b0C, such as muscle fillet \n\nsamples (area from head to pelvic fin). To avoid the oxidation of the lipid content in the \n\nsamples of liver, viscera and muscle, and since they will be used for determination of the lipid \n\ncontent and fatty acid composition profile, all were lyophilized during 48h (Heto PowerDry \n\nLL3000). \n\n \n\n2.4 Analytical methods \n\n2.4.1 Proximate analysis of diets and fish tissues \n\n \n\nFor determination of the proximate chemical composition of the experimental diets and \n\nfreeze-dried whole body of fish the following procedures were used: dry matter by drying at \n\n105 \u00b0C, for 24 h in a P-Selecta 207 oven; ash by combustion at 550 \u00b0C for 12 h in a muffle \n\nfurnace; crude protein (N\u00d76.25) by the Kjeldahl method after acid digestion; crude fat after \n\npetroleum ether extraction by the Soxhlet method and a SOXTEC System HT6 extractor; \n\ngross energy in an adiabatic bomb calorimeter (Werke C2000, IKA, Staufen, Germany). \n\nAmino acids profiles of diets were obtained after hydrolysis in 6 M HCL at 108 \u00b0C over 24 h \n\nin nitrogen-flushed glass vials. A Waters Pico-Tag reversed phase HPLC system, using \n\nnorleucine as an internal standard, was used. The resulting chromatograms were analyzed \n\nwith Breeze software (Waters, USA). Tryptophan was not analyzed since it is destroyed by \n\nacid hydrolysis, while glutamine and asparagine are converted to glutamate and aspartate, \n\nrespectively, during acid hydrolysis. \n\n \n\n2.4.2 Growth performance \n\n \n\nBiological evaluation of feed ingredients and finished feeds involves feeding fish and \n\nanalyzing some aspect of fish performance and/or diet digestibility. Therefore, several \n\nindices should be calculated, to assess the performance of feeds, their retention in the \n\ncarcass, and the values of nutrients that fish gain through the trial. At the end of the trial, to \n\nassess the performance of feeds, indices were calculated \u2013 Specific Growth Rate (SGR), \n\nFeed Conversion Ratio (FCR), Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER), and Voluntary Feed Index \n\n(VFI) \u2013 retention, in which the deposition of a nutrient in the carcass over a short time is \n\nmeasured, and gain, was calculated for protein, fat and energy.  \n\nAccurate prediction of the growth potential of a fish stock, under given husbandry \n\nconditions, is an inevitable prerequisite to estimate the energy or feed requirement (e.g., \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\nweekly ration). The formula most commonly used for fish growth rate expression is the \n\ninstantaneous growth rate, known as the Specific Growth Rate, which is based on the \n\nnatural logarithm of body weight, and can be used to compare growth on a daily basis: \n\n \n\n      \n                   \n\n    \n       \n\nIn this formula, FBW is the final mean body weight (g); IBW, the initial mean body \n\nweight (g); and D, the number of days. The SGR has been widely used by most biologists to \n\ndescribe the growth rate of fish, being dependent on the IBW, with comparisons of growth \n\nrates among groups made with similar IBW. \n\nOne of the most important ratios is the Feeding Conversion Ratio, being the quantity \n\nof feed fed divided by fish weight gain over a specific time period, with values typically \n\nranging from 1.5 to 0.8 in intensive fish culture (0.8 is a better ratio). The true FCR includes \n\nwasted feed and mortalities. The ratio, usually expressed as a true ratio (i.e. 1:1.5) is often \n\nquoted as a \"rate\" (1.5). FCRs of less than 1:1 are possible with commercial diets, as the \n\npellet being fed is a \"dry\" diet, and a high percentage of weight gained by the fish, is water \n\ntrapped in the tissues and cells. Feed conversion ratios with commercial \"dry\" diets are \n\ntypically in the region of 1:0.8 to 1:1.5. Ratios with wet diets are higher than this, and can be \n\nas high as 1:10. FCR varies according to several factors, including the nutritional and \n\nphysical quality of the aquafeed; environmental variants, such as temperature; the intensity \n\nof production (and therefore the availability or not of \u2018natural\u2019 feed); and other factors, \n\nincluding genetics (New and Wijkstr\u00f6m, 2002). The basic principle is to feed the fish right \n\nup to the point of fullness. If they are totally satisfied, fish will not be in stress and will provide \n\nquality food for human consumption. This requires that the aquiculture technician has the \n\nability to accurately judge the amount of food to be provided in each situation. With the \n\ntechnological development of aquaculture, many devices have been developed to assist in \n\ndetermining the amount of food to provide for obtaining optimal feeding regimens. The \n\nformula for FCR is defined as: \n\n \n\n      \n                 \n\n                      \n \n\nA useful method to compare protein sources in a single experiment is the Protein \n\nEfficiency Ratio, a measure of the weight gain per unit protein fed. There is a standard PER \n\nmethod (AOAC, 1998) involving rats. In this method, proteins are compared at a suboptimal \n\ndietary level. This ratio can tell the balance efficiency between protein and energy (protein \n\nsparing effect), and can measure the deposition of lipids by the same sparing effect. The \n\nPER is calculated as follows: \n\n \n\n      \n                 \n\n                                        \n \n\nIn this ratio, the crude protein intake in related to the percentage of protein present in \n\nthe feed, to accurately calculate the efficiency of retention of the protein present in the feed. \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\nFinally, a measure of feed intake, by weight, and by day, is calculated through \n\nVoluntary Feed Intake, standing as a percentage, is calculated by: \n\n \n\n      \n                 \n\n            \n      \n\nThis formula gives a notion of the percentage of feed that fish consume to increase \n\ntheir weight, on a daily basis. Temperature, diseases, light, and many others factors, that \n\nunbalance the respective comfort-zone, will have an increase or reduction on feed intake, \n\nvarying VFI. If fish get satiated with feeds that have a good efficiency (and they are fully on \n\ntheir comfort-zone), their VFI would be lower, since they need to intake less feed to grow and \n\nmaintain their balance.  \n\nThe retention of specific nutrients or energy in the whole body of fish over a specific \n\ntime period is a useful way of evaluating the availability and balance of amino acids and the \n\navailability of some essential elements and other nutrients as well. Based on data from feed \n\nintake and whole-body composition of fish, nutrient and energy retention (expressed as \n\npercentage of intake) as well as daily nutrient gain were calculated as follow:  \n\n \n\n                  \n                                                                   \n\n               \n \n\nThe livers were removed and weighed and expressed as percentage of body weight \n\nand used to calculate hepatosomatic (HSI) index: \n\n \n\n           \n            \n\n           \n       \n\nThe HSI provides an indication on status of energy reserve in an animal. In a poor \n\nenvironment, fish usually have a smaller liver (with less energy reserved in the liver).  \n\n \n\n2.4.3 Total lipids \n\n \n\nLipid content of liver and muscle tissue was determined using two different protocols, \n\nto assess differences: a modified Folch et al. (1957) method and petroleum ether extraction \n\nby the Soxhlet method using a SOXTEC System HT6 extractor (AOAC, 1998). The lipid \n\npercentage was then calculated by gravimetric analysis. It includes the weight of all lipid \n\ncomponents, including glycerol, soluble in the solvent system.  \n\n \n\n2.4.3.1 Fatty acid profile \n\n \n\nFatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were prepared according to Lepage and Roy \n\n(1986). The FAMEs preparation was carried out using 0.1 g of freeze dried material and 5 ml \n\nof acetyl chloride:methanol mixture (1:19, v/v). The esterification was carried out at 80\u00b0C \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\nover an one hour period. The organic phase was collected, filtered and dried over anhydrous \n\nsodium sulfate. Solvent was removed under nitrogen and the FAMEs dissolved in 0.1 ml of \n\nn-heptane.  \n\nThe analysis was performed in a gas chromatograph Varian CP-3800 (Walnut Creek, \n\nCA, USA) equipped with an auto-sampler and fitted with a flame ionization detector at 250\u00b0C. \n\nSeparation was done in a polyethylene glycol capillary column DB-WAX with 30 m in length, \n\n0.25 mm i.d., and 0.25 ?m film thicknesses from J&amp;B Scientific (USA). The column was \n\nsubjected to a temperature program starting at 180\u00b0C for 5 minutes, heating at 4\u00b0/minutes for \n\n10 minutes, and held up at 220\u00b0C for 25 minutes. The temperature of the injector (split ratio \n\n100:1) was kept constant at 250\u00b0C during the 40 minutes analysis. The quantification was \n\ndone using the area of the C21:0 internal standard. All analytical determinations were done \n\nin triplicate. Fatty acid methyl esters were identified by comparison with the retention times of \n\nknown mixtures of standards (Supelco, FAME 37 and PUFA 3). \n\nTo measure the propensity of meagre to influence the incidence of coronary heart \n\ndisease (CHD), two indices, the Index of Atherogenicity (IA), as a measure of fat deposition \n\nin arteries, and the Index of Thrombogenicity (IT), that measures the potential of fatty acids \n\nto provoke thrombosis, were calculated according to Ulbricht and Southgate (1991) \n\nequations:  \n\n \n\n      \n                       \n\n                            \n \n\n \n\n     \n                    \n\n                                                      \n \n\n \n\nTwo ratios related with fatty acid content were also calculated: (n-3)/(n-6) and \n\nPUFA/SFA, in order to allow comparisons with the United Kingdom Department of Health \n\nrecommendations (UKDH, 1994). \n\n \n\n2.5 Statistical analysis \n\n \n\nStatistical analyses followed methods outlined by Zar (1999). All data is expressed as \n\n(mean\u00b1SD). Data concerning dietary treatments were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA with \n\nSTATISTICA 11.0 software package (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). Since the experimental \n\ndesign was not orthogonal, a one-way ANOVA was used to identify differences between the \n\n2 dietary protein levels and the 3 dietary lipid levels, at p&lt;0,05, and their weight in the data. \n\nWhen these tests showed significance, pair-wise comparisons (Tukey's HSD) were used to \n\ndetermine the differences between means. If the data did not meet the assumptions of an \n\nANOVA (Levene\u2019s test for homogeneity of variance and Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s test for normality), a \n\nnon-parametric one-way Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA was used to compare means at p&lt;0,05. \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\n \n\n3 RESULTS \n\n3.1 Proximate analysis of diets \n\n \n\nSurvival rate of the fish in different experimental tanks varied between 95,2 and 100% \n\nwith no significant difference (p&lt;0,05) in fish mortality among different diet groups. \n\nThe proximate chemical composition of the five experimental diets is presented in \n\n(Graph 3.1). Comparing these values (obtained in the beginning of the trial) with the values \n\nassessed in the formulation of the feeds (Table 2.1), there are no differences, in terms of \n\nnutrients. The amounts of protein and lipids remain the same, the diets are isoenergetic, and \n\nthe amount of phosphorus is equal. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 Composition of the five different treatments.

Fishes fed \n\ntreatment 50L15 had a significant content of muscle SFA (34,49\u00b15,83 %), due to high \n\ncontent in palmitic (16:0 - 23,47\u00b14,78 %)  and stearic (18:0 - 8,07\u00b10,70 %) acids, having the \n\nlowest contents in MUFA (18,52\u00b11,27 %), DHA [22:6(n-3) - 20,47\u00b14,88 %] and PUFA \n\n(41,39\u00b15,60 %). Muscle samples from fishes fed treatment 50L12 had the lowest content in \n\nSFA (30,35\u00b13,00 %) and EPA [20:5(n-3) - 7,69\u00b10,48 %], but had the highest content in \n\nMUFA (21,58\u00b12,96 %), mainly due to the high percentage of oleic acid (18:1(n-9) - \n\n11,95\u00b10,82 %) and the presence of 22:1(n-11) (1,01\u00b10,23 %). Treatment 50L18 presented \n\nthe highest percentage of muscle EPA (20:5(n-3) - 9,12\u00b10,23 %), while treatment 44L15 had \n\nthe highest percentage of muscle DHA [22:6(n-3) - 23,04\u00b14,61 %] and PUFA (44,26\u00b16,22 \n\n%).  \n\nThe highest and lowest content of muscle (n-3) fatty acids was, respectively, found in \n\ntreatment 44L15 (36,14\u00b16,20 %) and treatment 44L18 (32,75\u00b11,30 %), mainly due to \n\ndifferences in DHA content. The sum of (n-6) fatty acids showed that fishes fed the diet \n\n50L12 had the highest content (9,50\u00b10,57 %), while fishes fed diet 44L15 had the lowest \n\ncontent (7,26\u00b10,07 %) in (n-6) fatty acids. The highest (n-3)/(n-6) fatty acids ratio was \n\nrecorded in fishes fed diet 44L15 (4,98\u00b10,01 %), and the lowest in diet 50L12 (3,52\u00b10,01 %), \n\nwhich also presented the highest PUFA/SFA ratio recorded (1,45\u00b10,23 %). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Dietary treatments  ANOVA \n\n 44L15 44L18 50L12 50L15 50L18  L P \n\nLipid deposition \n\nLiver (Soxhlet) 56,13\u00b19,18 58,26\u00b110,05 53,01\u00b17,61b 56,22\u00b18,71 63,11\u00b13,98a  * NS \n\nDigestive tract (Folch) 20,22\u00b10,81 23,46\u00b10,77a 22,57\u00b11,71 17,56\u00b11,73b 23,64\u00b13,00  * NS \n\nMuscle (Soxhlet) 2,08\u00b10,86 1,96\u00b10,57 2,29\u00b10,78 2,28\u00b10,88 2,86\u00b11,43  NS NS \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\nTable 3.5 \u2013 Fatty acid methyl ester profile of meagre fed each different treatment.

They are sensitive to shades \n\nand noises, and can get stressed with no difficult. Since meagre fish possesses a voracious \n\nappetite, feeding follows a pattern. When feeds are on the top of the water, and after \n\nhydration, they start to dive towards the bottom, meagre prefers to feed mostly in the middle, \n\nand less preference for the bottom of the tank.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 3.12 \u2013 Fiberglass tank with experimental fishes, and the safety net on top, to prevent \n\ndeaths. \n\n \n\n4 DISCUSSION \n\n \n\nThere is a very limited knowledge on dietary nutrient requirements of meagre. The \n\nassessment of a optimum dietary protein:lipid ratio is essential to maximize production output \n\nand reduce costs. In a culture environment, the replication of wild conditions is made with \n\nease, but feeds still represent the most important variable. With low dietary protein available, \n\ngrowth of meagre may be retarded, and with high content in dietary protein, feed will become \n\nvery expensive and nitrogenous waste would be produced (NRC, 1993). The same stands \n\nfor dietary lipids \u2013 deficiency makes the other nutrients (mainly protein) to be used for body \n\nmaintenance and energy production, retarding growth, while excess of lipids may result in \n\nexcessive fat deposition in visceral cavity and tissues. Many authors have found this \n\nexcessive lipid deposition when studying the Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hipoglossus) \n\n(Martins et al., 2007), red drum (Sciaenops ocellata) (Craig et al., 1999), brown meagre \n\n(Sciaena umbra) (Cakli et al., 2006; Chatzifotis et al., 2006) and dusky kob (Argyrosomus \n\njaponicus) (Bernatzeder et al., 2010; Woolley et al., 2010). \n\nStudies argue that sciaenids grow faster in cages than in tanks (Ortega and G\u00e1ndara, \n\n2007; Piccolo et al., 2008; C\u00e1rdenas, 2010; Chatzifotis et al., 2011), so growth \n\nparameters must be calculated and compared, to assess the efficacy of treatments. In \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\ngeneral, feed 50L18 presented the best performance when compared with the other \n\ntreatments, since it is within the desired levels of dietary protein (DP) and dietary lipid (DL), \n\nreferred by C\u00e1rdenas (2010): DP>45% and DL?17%. On the other way, feed 50L12 had the \n\nworst performance, mainly because of the low levels of dietary lipids. The reference levels for \n\nDP and DL were used in many studies (Chatzifotis et al., 2006; Woolley et al., 2010; \n\nChatzifotis et al., 2011; Mart\u00ednez-Llorens et al., 2011). The compliance with those values \n\nallows SGR rates to be higher than 1%/day, with feeds 50L15 and 50L18 showing the \n\nhighest SGR\u2019s (0,99\u00b10,04 and 1,21\u00b10,00, respectively), which are comparable to the values \n\nobtained by Woolley et al. (2010), Chatzifotis et al. (2011) and Mart\u00ednez-Llorens et al. \n\n(2011). Within the 50% DP group of treatments, 50L18 showed the highest PER (2,33\u00b10,09), \n\nand the lowest FCR (1.04\u00b10,04), showing that high values of DP and DL makes meagre to \n\ngrow more (Chatzifotis et al., 2011), making the efficiency of feeds to be higher.  \n\nThe increase of dietary lipid within the 50% DP group appears to have a spare protein \n\neffect (Chatzifotis et al., 2011), but when analyzing the 44% DP group, it is notable that the \n\nincrease in dietary lipids (from 44L15 to 44L18) actually diminishes PER means values, so \n\nthe protein sparing effect by the increase of dietary lipids cannot be confirmed. High values \n\nof PER are related with high values of feed efficiency and high weight increase (Thoman et \n\nal., 1999), situation confirmed with treatments with 50% DP, when compared with 44% DP \n\ntreatments.  \n\nThe values of FCR are correlated to the amount of food ingested versus the fish \n\nweight. With similar amounts of ingested feed, treatment 50L18 allowed fishes to grow more, \n\nand therefore, to present lower FCR than the other treatments. Chatzifotis et al. (2010) and \n\nMart\u00ednez-Llorens et al. (2011) obtained similar results with feeds having the same values of \n\ngroup 44% DP, having poor growth together with high feeding rates, making mean values of \n\nFCR being higher than 1,38, which is according to the values obtained in this trial.  \n\nFinally, the high levels of dietary lipid inclusion make feeds more palatability acceptable \n\n(Est\u00e9vez et al., 2011), and that fact could be confirmed by the high VFI recorded in diets \n\n44L18, 50L15 and 50L18. \n\nThe retention values of dry matter (DM), protein and energy were higher in fishes fed \n\ntreatment 50L18, accompanied by high daily gain mean values of nitrogen (N) and energy. \n\nThe high amount of protein present in the 50% DP group allowed fishes to retain more \n\nprotein than the 44% DP group, showing that feeds for meagre should have around 50% of \n\ncrude protein in their formulation (Chatzifotis et al., 2011), which also allows fishes to retain \n\nmore N per kg of body weight.  \n\nAll feeds were isoenergetic, and retention of energy was not different among \n\ntreatments, with similar results being recorded by Woolley et al. (2010). On a daily gain \n\nbasis, diet 50L18 allowed fishes to gain more energy, opposite with diet 50L12, which \n\npresented the lowest value (0,51\u00b10,16 kJ) recorded. An absence of energy gain could be \n\ninterpreted as a diet poor in nutrients (especially dietary lipids) allied with a very low feed \n\nintake.  \n\nThe retention of dietary lipids was not statistically different among treatments, mainly \n\ndue to the big variation among the data set, but some approximations may be inferred. The \n\nbalance of dietary protein with dietary lipid in each diet influences the percentage of lipids \n\nthat are retained, showing that the level of 12% DL is not appropriated for meagre \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\n(Chatzifotis et al., 2010; Chatzifotis et al., 2011), so diet 50L12 should not be used in \n\nformulation of commercial feeds. \n\nSimilarly to what has been found in other cultured species, the proximate composition \n\nof meagre is affected by endogenous factors such as fish size and exogenous factors such \n\nas diet composition (Chatzifotis et al., 2011). On a whole body composition basis, and \n\nregarding dry matter values, feeds 44L15 and 44L18 presented high mean values for DM, \n\nmainly due to its lower content in DP, when compared with the 50% DP group.  \n\nThe value of dry matter protein was lower with treatment 44L18, since the interaction \n\nbetween an high level of DL and a low level of DP makes the levels of DP in fishes to be \n\nlower. The dry matter lipid was higher in the 44% DP group, since both DP and DL levels \n\ninfluence the amount of lipids present in fishes, with treatment 50L12 to have the lowest \n\nmean values, mainly due to the low lipid retention recorded. Its value is even lower than the \n\ninitial one, what can be interpreted as the bad performance of this feed.  \n\nWhen on a fresh matter basis, moisture values of 50% DP group were higher than \n\n44L18, mainly due to the low protein content in treatments 44% DP. Moisture and lipid values \n\ntend to have an inverse correlation (Cakli et al., 2006), and that was notable in the level of \n\nlipid in fishes fed diet 44L18 (6,53\u00b10,94 %), opposing with fishes fed diet 50L12 (4,57\u00b10,90 \n\n%), and when accounting moisture values, the ones of diet 50L12 (72,85\u00b10,75 %) were \n\nhigher than 44L18 (71,16\u00b10,65 %), being these values similar to ones obtained by \n\nChatzifotis et al. (2010).  \n\nRegarding energy levels, diet 44L18 presented higher value when compared with \n\n50L12, mainly due to the different lipid content in the feeds, since high amounts of lipids \n\ncould be used as an energy resource (Chatzifotis et al., 2006). Values of ash and protein \n\nwere similar between all treatments, and in accordance with the study made by Chatzifotis \n\net al. (2010). \n\nThe lipid content of liver was higher in treatment 50L18 (63,11\u00b13,98 %) than in \n\ntreatment 50L12 (53,01\u00b17,61 %), but similar to treatment 44L18 (58,26\u00b110,05 %). The \n\nvalues of muscle lipid are not significant different between treatments, with an average value \n\nof 2,3%. These values are much higher than the ones obtained with brown meagre and red \n\ndrum (Chatzifotis et al., 2006), regarding the lipid content of liver, but similar to the values \n\nobtained for muscle fat, confirming that meagre is a low fat fish. These findings prove the \n\nminor role of muscle as an energy depot, but liver still is the main energy central that fulfills \n\nmeagre energy needs. Nevertheless, when dissecting fishes from treatment 50L18, there \n\nwere fat mesenteric depots within the abdominal wall, so fat was being accumulated in two \n\nplaces, and that it is not desirable. \n\nThe obtained digestive tract fat percentages, ranging from 17,56\u00b11,73 (%) to \n\n23,64\u00b13,00 (%), were abnormal, and can only be due to errors in the dissection of the \n\nviscera. Since the viscera does not represent a fat storage depot, no conclusions could be \n\nmade with the obtained data. \n\nThe HSI between treatments showed no differences, but the mean value was 2,45, \n\nbeing higher than the ones obtained in the studies made by Piccolo et al. (2008) and \n\nChatzifotis et al. (2010), mainly due to the high lipid content of livers, but no correlation was \n\nmade between HSI and dietary nutrient levels (Woolley et al., 2006). \n\nThe fatty acid profile of the different treatments presented no significant differences, but \n\nthe mean values of SFA (?32%), MUFA (?20%), PUFA (?43%) and the ratio (n-3)/(n-6) \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\n(?4.2), are in accordance to the values referred by Poli et al. (2003), C\u00e1rdenas (2010), \n\nGrigorakis et al. (2011) and Mart\u00ednez-Llorens et al. (2011). The values for the (n-3)/(n-6) \n\nratio in this trial are better than the ones obtained by Lenas and Nathanailides (2011), when \n\nworking with wild sea bass, with meagre presenting more omega-3. These findings, together \n\nwith the low AI and TI, proves that meagre is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, \n\nessential to a good heart condition and overall health benefits. \n\n5 CONCLUSION \n\nThe main purpose of experimental trials within aquaculture is to create new techniques \n\nand feeding protocols, minimizing costs and maximizing production. The five experimental \n\nfeeds had differences that may argue that some are not appropriate for the breading of \n\nmeagre. Feeds with low dietary lipid, such as diet 50L12 should not be used for meagre \n\naquaculture, since it doesn\u2019t supply fishes with the necessary protein and lipids for a \n\noptimum growth. Since the balance of dietary protein and dietary lipid is essential for an \n\noptimum growth, diet 50L18 was the best one for the meagre growout, but its value of dietary \n\nlipid should be rearranged, since some fishes would gain unwanted mesenteric fat. Diet \n\n44L18 had a good performance, but its low level of dietary protein is a drawback for the \n\nrearing of meagre. Diet 50L15 had similar values to diet 50L18, not possessing significant \n\ndifferences, and without the problems with mesenteric fat deposition. \n\nIn a future study, diets should take in account the value of 50% dietary protein, and \n\nvalues between 15% and 18% of dietary lipid. Nevertheless, protein is still the most \n\nexpensive ingredient when formulating feeds, but these values seem to be a good approach \n\nfor an optimum diet that could maximize meagre growth. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\n6 REFERENCES \n\n \n\nAOAC, 1998. \u201cOfficial Methods of Analysis, 16th ed., 4th revision\u201d.
