Nesta zona \u00e9 onde \nse d\u00e1 a mistura entre a \u00e1gua salgada proveniente do oceano e a \u00e1gua doce de \norigem fluvial. Para fazer a monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o da temperatura da \u00e1gua no Canal do\nEspinheiro foi utilizada uma nova tecnologia que consiste num cabo de fibra \n\u00f3ptica longitudinal de 10 km de extens\u00e3o, com 18 sensores de temperatura \nespa\u00e7ados de 500 m, desde a embocadura at\u00e9 \u00e0 foz do Rio Vouga. \nResultados de um ano de monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o da temperatura da \u00e1gua permitiram \nestudar a sua variabilidade espacial e temporal em fun\u00e7\u00e3o de dois for\u00e7amentos\nprincipais: mar\u00e9 e condi\u00e7\u00f5es meteorol\u00f3gicas. \nA evolu\u00e7\u00e3o temporal longitudinal da temperatura da \u00e1gua foi estudada, tendo \nsido aplicadas t\u00e9cnicas matem\u00e1ticas, tais como: an\u00e1lise espectral, an\u00e1lise \nespectral cruzada e fun\u00e7\u00f5es emp\u00edricas ortogonais (EOFs). \nA an\u00e1lise espectral mostra picos de maior energia que surgem nas frequ\u00eancias \nsemi-diurnas e diurnas. Estas frequ\u00eancias podem estar relacionadas com a\nvaria\u00e7\u00e3o diurna da temperatura do ar e da mar\u00e9, mostrando a import\u00e2ncia das\nvari\u00e1veis meteorol\u00f3gicas na modula\u00e7\u00e3o da temperatura da \u00e1gua em regi\u00f5es\npouco profundas. A an\u00e1lise espectral cruzada permitiu avaliar o desfasamento\ntemporal entre a temperatura da \u00e1gua e do ar, que varia conforme a \nprofundidade do local. Tamb\u00e9m permitiu observar que a mar\u00e9 tem uma grande \ninflu\u00eancia na distribui\u00e7\u00e3o da temperatura da \u00e1gua, nomeadamente perto da \nembocadura da laguna. As EOFs mostram que a variabilidade da temperatura \nda \u00e1gua pode ser explicada maioritariamente pela primeira componente, que \nest\u00e1 relacionada com a varia\u00e7\u00e3o anual da temperatura do ar. \nOs resultados mostram que os dois for\u00e7amentos principais (mar\u00e9 e condi\u00e7\u00f5es \nmeteorol\u00f3gicas) determinam a temperatura da \u00e1gua no interior do canal do \nEspinheiro.

In order to monitoring the water \ntemperature in the Espinheiro channel a new technology was used, consisting \non an optical-fibre longitudinal cable 10 km long with 18 temperature sensors \nseparated by 500 m, from the mouth of the lagoon to the mouth of Vouga River.\nResults of a one year monitoring of water temperature permitted to study its \nspatial and temporal variability in terms of two major forcing: tides and\nmeteorological conditions. \nThe temporal evolution of the longitudinal water temperature was studied, and\nmathematical techniques, such as spectral analysis, cross-spectral analysis \nand Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) were applied to the data. \nThe spectral analysis shows high energy peaks in both semidiurnal and diurnal \nfrequencies. These frequencies may be related to the daily variation and tidal\nforcing, demonstrating the importance of the meteorological variables in the\nmodulation of the water temperature in shallow areas. The cross-spectral \nanalysis permitted to evaluate the time lag between the water and air \ntemperature, which varies depending on the local depth. It also permitted to \nobserve that the tide has a great influence on the water temperature \ndistribution, particularly near the mouth of the lagoon. EOFs show that the \nvariability of the water temperature can be explained by the first component, \nwhich is closely related to the annual variation of the air temperature. \nThe results show the importance of the two major forcings (tides and \nmeteorological conditions) that determine the water temperature within the\nEspinheiro channel. It can also be observed that the water temperature\ndistribution is also influenced by the seasonal variation of meteorological\nconditions and by the channel\u2019s depth variation, which presents very shallow\nareas. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nvii \n\nContents \n\n        Acknowledgements                                                                                                        i \n\n        Resumo                                                                                                                         iii \n\n        Abstract                                                                                                                         v \n\n          List of Figures                                                                                                             ix \n\n        List of Tables                                                                                                               xi \n\n1 Introduction ....................................................................................................................................... 1 \n\n2 Study area ........................................................................................................................................... 5 \n\n3 Materials and Methods .................................................................................................................. 7 \n3.1 Data........................................................................................................................ 7 \n3.2 Data analysis........................................................................................................ 10 \n\n4 Observations and environmental data .................................................................................. 13 \n4.1 Meteorological conditions ................................................................................... 13 \n4.2 Tides .................................................................................................................... 14 \n4.3 Water flow ........................................................................................................... 14 \n\n5 Results and Discussion ................................................................................................................. 17 \n5.1 Spatial variability................................................................................................. 17 \n\n5.1.1 Harmonic analysis ........................................................................................... 19 \n5.2 Temporal variability ............................................................................................ 20 \n\n5.2.1 Spectral analysis .............................................................................................. 26 \n5.2.2 Cross-spectral analysis .................................................................................... 28 \n\n5.3 Spatial- temporal variability ................................................................................ 36 \n5.3.1 Seasonal variability ......................................................................................... 36 \n5.3.2 Empirical Orthogonal Functions analysis ....................................................... 42 \n\n6 Conclusions....................................................................................................................................... 45 \n\n References ......................................................................................................................................... 47 \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nviii \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nix \n\nList of Figures \n\n2.1: The Ria Aveiro lagoon and an enlargement of the Espinheiro channel. ............................... 6 \n\n3.1: The Espinheiro channel and the location of the electrical and optical cables. ...................... 7 \n\n3.2: Depth at each sensor\u2019s position. ............................................................................................ 8 \n\n3.3: Schematic representation of the mouth of Ria de Aveiro and the electrodes placed in the \n\nnorthern and southern borders for the measurement of the electrical potential difference \n\n(Dias et al., 2003). ................................................................................................................ 8 \n\n3.4: Duration of the data time series ............................................................................................ 9 \n\n4.1: Air temperature, precipitation and wind velocity in Aveiro meteorological station, from \n\nOctober 2004 to October 2005. .......................................................................................... 13 \n\n4.2: Time series of the water level.

Accordingly, \n\nan estuary is a zone of transition between the marine-dominated systems (ocean) and the \n\nupland river systems.  \n\nWater temperature influences the rate of plant photosynthesis (Wang et al., 2007), \n\nthe metabolic rates of aquatic organisms (Atkinson et al., 1987), and the sensitivity of \n\norganisms to toxic wastes, parasites, and diseases (USEPA, 1997). As example, water \n\ntemperature increases, the capacity of water to hold dissolved oxygen becomes lower. \n\nEstuarine water temperature in temperate regions is primarily a function of the \n\ntemperatures of influent streams, rivers, the ocean, and tidal stage (Reid and Wood, 1976). \n\nEstuarine water temperature also varies with air temperature, depth, which leads to vertical \n\ntemperature gradients, changes in the amount of freshwater, and the extent to which \n\nfreshwater is mixed with marine water by winds or tides. Also, discharges of \u201ccooling\u201d \n\nwaters from power plants and municipal or industrial effluents are sources of thermal \n\npollution in the coastal zone. Because most estuaries are shallow, there can be considerable \n\ndiurnal and seasonal temperature variations (Kaplan et al., 2003). \n\nIn order to characterize the water temperature in coastal regions some studies have \n\nbeen performed: Aliani et al. (2004) applied the tidal harmonic analysis to identify the low \n\nfrequencies in the temperature series at a marine shallow water hydrothermal vent in Milos \n\nIsland. Harcourt-Baldwin and Diedericks (2006) studied the density currents in Tomales \n\nBay (California) whose formation is controlled by tidal conditions, ocean temperature, \n\nwind, insolation and estuary depth; freshwater inflow at the head of the estuary had no \n\nimpact on the density intrusions. Paraso and Valle-Levinson (1996) concluded that the \n\nbarometric pressure and wind forcing were responsible for the horizontal water \n\ntemperature gradient in the lower Chesapeake Bay. Uncles and Stephens (2001) studied the \n\nannual cycle of temperature and associated heat fluxes in the Tamar Estuary and concluded \n\nthat the daily averaged heat transport towards the coastal zone closely followed the \n\ntemperature difference between freshwater and coastal waters and was modulated by both \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nIntroduction   2 \n\nfreshwater flow and spring-neap tidal variations. Newton and Mudge (2003) studied the \n\ntemperature and salinity regimes in a shallow, mesotidal lagoon, the Ria Formosa \n\n(Portugal) and demonstrated that in areas inside of the lagoon there were different \n\ntemperature and salinity characteristics compared to the inflowing coastal water, both in \n\nWinter and Summer. Thomas et al. (2002) concluded that the differences in sea surface \n\ntemperature (SST) along the central coast of Maine (USA) in Summer are due to \n\ndifferences in residual circulation, freshwater input and flushing. Empirical Orthogonal \n\nFunctions (EOFs) analysis was used to study the dominant patterns of SST variance in \n\nDelaware Bay (Keiner and Yan, 1997) and to study the SST variability off Northern and \n\nCentral California from AVHRR Satellite Imagery (Armstrong, 1995).  \n\nIn this work is studied the water temperature variability analysis along the \n\nEspinheiro Channel. The Espinheiro Channel is one of the four main branches of Ria de \n\nAveiro, a mesotidal and shallow coastal lagoon located in the northwest coast of Portugal. \n\nThis channel connects the major source of freshwater of the lagoon, the Vouga River, to \n\nthe Atlantic Ocean, being ideal to perform studies such as the one proposed here. Ria de \n\nAveiro provides natural conditions for harbor, navigation and recreation facilities and it is \n\nalso a place of discharge of domestic and industrial wastes. \n\nThe fast and complex dynamics of Ria de Aveiro, along with its physical and \n\nbiogeochemical importance has motivated several studies in the region, including: \n\nnumerical modeling studies of its hydrodynamics (Dias, 2001; Sousa and Dias, 2007; Vaz \n\net al., 2007). Previous hydrological characterizations of Ria de Aveiro (Dias et al., 1999; \n\nVaz et al., 2005; Vaz and Dias, 2008) conclude that the lagoon can be considered as \n\nvertically homogeneous, except in very strong freshwater flows events, where the lagoon \n\nbecomes weakly stratified. Several studies were performed to investigate topics such as the \n\ntidal propagation in the lagoon (Dias et al., 2000), the Lagrangian transport of particles \n\n(Dias et al., 2001) and sediment transport (Lopes et al., 2001). Abrantes et al. (2006) \n\nstudied the suspended sediment concentration in different parts of the lagoon during tidal \n\ncycles which showed a significant spatial and temporal variability. \n\nThe characteristics of Ria de Aveiro, as well as of other estuarine systems, make \n\npermanent monitoring particularly important for its management. The use of conventional \n\nsampling technologies of physical parameters revealed to be very expensive and hard to \n\nuse in high spatial and temporal scales. Water temperature is closely connected to many \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nIntroduction   3 \n\nbiological and chemical processes in the estuary. For this reason, and because it is easily \n\nmeasured, temperature is commonly monitored. To monitor the water temperature there \n\nare various instruments, most of all based on the use of thermistors (type of resistor with \n\nresistance varying according to its temperature), but most are only used for short time \n\nperiods (Vaz and Dias, 2008). Goto et al. (2003) used the WaDar temperature logger, \n\nwhich is a shelf-recording thermometer designed for long term temperature monitoring, in \n\norder to monitor hydrothermal activity. With the purpose of long term monitoring water \n\ntemperature and without the need of regular human intervention, a new technology \n\ncomposed by an optical longitudinal cable integrating fibre Bragg grating sensors was \n\ndeveloped and installed in the Espinheiro channel, in the frame of the research project \n\nProteu (POCTI/MAR/15275/1999). \n\nThe objectives of this work are to study the water temperature variability along the \n\nchannel that connects the ocean to the major freshwater input in the lagoon, evaluating the \n\nimportance of the main forcing mechanisms: tides and meteorological conditions. The \n\nwater temperature is monitored using the new technology referred above. The data under \n\nanalysis consist in 18 annual time series of water temperature from sampling locations \n\nseparated by 500 m, allowing the study of its spatial and temporal variability. The temporal \n\nevolution of the longitudinal water temperature gradients is studied and mathematical \n\ntechniques such as the spectral and cross-spectral analysis, harmonic analysis and EOFs \n\nare applied to the data. \n\nThis work is divided into six sections. Section 2, includes the description of the study \n\narea. Section 3 contains short descriptions of the data and of the mathematical techniques \n\napplied to study the spatial, temporal and spatial-temporal variability of the water \n\ntemperature. Section 4 shows the observations and environmental data used in this study. \n\nThe results are discussed in Section 5. Section 6 summarizes the main conclusions and the \n\nfuture work suggestions.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nIntroduction   4 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nStudy area   5 \n\n2 Study area \nRia de Aveiro is a mesotidal shallow (mean depth of about 1 m relative to the local \n\ndatum) vertically homogeneous lagoon with a very complex geometry located on the \n\nnorthwest Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula, in Portugal (40\u00ba38\u2019N, 8\u00ba45\u2019W) (Figure \n\n2.1). It is 45 km long and 10 km wide and covers an area of 83 km2 at high tide (spring \n\ntide), which is reduced to 66 km2 at low tide. It is characterized by narrow channels and by \n\nlarge areas of mud flats and salt marshes. The lagoon has four main channels: Mira and \n\n\u00cdlhavo channels in its southern region, S. Jacinto channel in its northern region and the \n\nEspinheiro channel in the very complex central area of the lagoon. In order to simplify, the \n\nstudy area from the mouth up to the channel\u2019s head, close to the mouth of the Vouga River \n\nwill be hereinafter referred as Espinheiro channel. The study area is approximately 11 km \n\nlong, has an average width of 200 m and a mean depth, along its longitudinal axis, of about \n\n10 m.  \n\nThe tides in the Ria de Aveiro are semidiurnal, being M2 and S2 the most important \n\nconstituents, representing more than 90% of the tidal energy (Dias et al., 1999). The \n\nestimated tidal prism for the lagoon\u2019s mouth at extreme spring and extreme neap is \n\naccording to Dias (2001) 136.7\u00d7106 m3 and 34.9\u00d7106 m3, respectively. The estimated tidal \n\nprism for the real Espinheiro channel is about 40\u00d7106 at extreme spring tide and 15\u00d7106 m3 \n\nat extreme neap tide (Dias, 2001). The total estimated freshwater input for the lagoon is \n\nvery small (about 1.8\u00d7106 m3 during tidal cycle) (Moreira et al., 1993) when compared to \n\nthe tidal prism both at the mouth or at the beginning of Espinheiro channel.  \n\nEspinheiro channel may be considered the most important area of the Ria de Aveiro, \n\nbecause the strongest currents are observed here, reaching values higher than 2 ms-1. The \n\nother channels are mainly shallow and tidal flat areas, contributing to a strong damping of \n\ncurrents (Vaz, 2007). The salinity ranges from fluvial (about 0 psu) to oceanic typical \n\nvalues (between 32 and 35 psu), depending on the freshwater inputs (Dias, 2001; Vaz et al, \n\n2005). The hydrodynamic of the channel is largely dependent on the tidal wave \n\ncharacteristics and freshwater inputs variability. \n\nThe most important freshwater contribution is from Vouga River. Its mouth is \n\nlocated near the head of the study area and therefore its freshwater inflow is determinant in \n\nthe establishment of the channel\u2019s physical patterns. When the river flow is low (less than \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nStudy area   6 \n\n10 m3s-1) the water column is filled with salt water from the ocean until almost 8 km from \n\nthe channel\u2019s mouth. When the river flow is higher than 100 m3s-1 vertical stratification is \n\nestablished along the channel, and the freshwater from Vouga River extends its influence \n\nup to the channel\u2019s mouth. When the river flow is between 30 and 50 m3s-1, the channel \n\ncan be divided into three deferent regions: a lower marine region where the thermohaline \n\nvariables present oceanic values; an intermediate inner region where mixing between \n\nocean and river water occurs and a upper fluvial region which is dominated by freshwater \n\nbut is still subject to a semidiurnal tidal action (Vaz and Dias, 2008). \n\n \nFigure 2.1: The Ria Aveiro lagoon and an enlargement of the Espinheiro channel. \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nMaterials and Methods   7 \n\n3 Materials and Methods \n\n3.1 Data \n\nThe data used in this study are: the water temperature measured in 18 sensors along \n\nthe channel, the water flow between the lagoon and the ocean, the meteorological data at \n\nthe University of Aveiro, the sea surface elevation (SSE) at the mouth of the lagoon and \n\nthe sea surface temperature (SST) along the Portuguese coast.  \n\nThe water temperature was measured through an optical sensing cable integrating \n\nfibre Bragg grating sensors. This cable is fixed along the channel bed, from the lagoon \n\ninlet to the river mouth, and is connected to a datalogger and to a GSM system. It has 18 \n\nsensors (separated by 500 m) along the 10 km allowing the long term and real time \n\nmonitoring of this channel with an excellent spatial resolution. The original data have ~18 \n\nminutes of temporal resolution, and the measurements were performed sequentially from \n\nsensor 1 to 18, and therefore are not simultaneous. The field data used in this study results \n\nof 1-year measurements of water temperature data (from September 2004 to October 2005, \n\nwhen Portugal was under a severe drought). The data under analysis consists of 18 annual \n\ntime series of water temperature with 402 days length from sampling locations 500 m \n\ndistant. The original data was hourly interpolated in order to obtain simultaneously results \n\nfor all sensors. \n\nIt must be noted that in Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2, 19 sensors are represented, but \n\nsensor 16 is inactive. Sensor 1 is located near the mouth of the lagoon and the last one \n\n(sensor 19) is located near the channel\u2019s head, close to the mouth of the Vouga River. \n\nThese sensors were used as a reference to the Atlantic Ocean and to the Vouga River. \n\n \nFigure 3.1: The Espinheiro channel and the location of the electrical and optical cables. \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nMaterials and Methods   8 \n\n \nFigure 3.2: Depth at each sensor\u2019s position. \n\n \n\nThe water flow between the ocean and the lagoon was measured with an electrical \n\ncable with electrodes at its terminals deployed transversally to the inlet channel (Figure \n\n3.3). These electrodes measure the electrical potential difference between the mouth and \n\nborder of Ria de Aveiro (Figure 3.1). This electrical potential difference is induced by the \n\neffect of the geomagnetic field through charge in solitary movement with the water that \n\nflows through the channel. Then, knowing the geomagnetic field and the electrical \n\npotential difference, the water flow through the mouth of Ria de Aveiro can be quantified, \n\nallowing the study of the lagoon-ocean exchanges. This system was previously calibrated, \n\nadjusting its results with values obtained by hydrodynamic modeling. The implementation \n\nand basis of this system is fully described in Nolasco et al. (2006). These data are used to \n\ncharacterize the entrance and exit of water in Ria de Aveiro.   \n\n \nFigure 3.3: Schematic representation of the mouth of Ria de Aveiro and the electrodes placed in the \nnorthern and southern borders for the measurement of the electrical potential difference (Dias et al., \n2003). \n \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nMaterials and Methods   9 \n\nHourly meteorological data (air temperature, precipitation and wind velocity) were \n\nmeasured at the meteorological station located at the University of Aveiro (40\u00ba38\u2019N, \n\n8\u00ba39\u2019W). This data set is from October 2004 to October 2005, covering the period under \n\nanalysis.  \n\nThe measurements of SSE were obtained from a tidal gauge located at the mouth of \n\nthe lagoon.  \n\nThe satellite data were obtained from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging \n\nSpectroradiometer), a key instrument aboard the Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) \n\nsatellites. Terra's orbit around the Earth is timed so that it passes from north to south across \n\nthe equator in the morning, while Aqua passes south to north over the equator in the \n\nafternoon. Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS are viewing the entire Earth's surface every 1 \n\nto 2 days, acquiring data in 36 spectral bands, between 0.405 and 14.385 \u00b5m, and they \n\nacquire data in three spatial resolutions: 250 m, 500 m and 1000 m. These observations can \n\nbe processed to show many properties of the Earth's surface, from temperature and \n\nphytoplankton measurements near the surface of the ocean to fire occurrences and land \n\ncover characteristics on the land surface. The measurements can only be taken in ocean \n\nregions that are free of clouds and sun glint. These data were used to produce SST daily \n\nmaps for the Summer months. These SST data are concurrent with the period of the water \n\ntemperature data (measured by the sensors), in order to observe the influence of the SST in \n\nthe water temperature measured at the sensors located near the mouth of the lagoon.  \n\nThe duration of the data time series are summarized in Figure 3.4. \n\n \nFigure 3.4: Duration of the data time series (WT-water temperature; WF-water flow; MD- \nmeteorological data; SSE \u2013sea surface elevation; SST-sea surface temperature). \n \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nMaterials and Methods  10 \n\n3.2 Data analysis \n\nData were analyzed in order to study the spatial and temporal water temperature \n\nvariability in the Espinheiro channel and its relation with the forcing mechanisms. \n\nIn order to study the spatial variability, it was necessary to proceed to a previous \n\nstatistical analysis, in order to verify the behavior of water temperature along the channel. \n\nWith the purpose of establishing the relevance of each tidal constituent along the \n\nEspinheiro channel, the classical harmonic analysis was applied to the water temperature \n\ndata using the T_TIDE package (Pawlowicz et al., 2002). \n\nThe next step is the study of the water temperature temporal variability along the \n\nEspinheiro channel, evaluating the relations between the temperature data and the available \n\nmeteorological and tide data along the channel. In order to separate the high frequency \n\nsignal (tidal oscillations) and the low frequency signal (subtidal oscillations), the trend of \n\nthe water temperature time series was removed and the series were high/low-pass filtered, \n\nconsidering a cut-off frequency of 0.0000093 Hz (30 h). \n\nSpectral analysis in the domain of frequency in this work is very important because it \n\nallows the evaluation of the ocean-atmosphere interaction. These results permit to \n\nunderstand the impact of atmospheric perturbations and the tide over the water \n\ntemperature. This analysis (8 Hanning windows) consists in partitioning the variance of a \n\ntime series into a function of frequency. The study of the energy spectrum provides an \n\nalternative way of estimating the attenuation of the tidal and subtidal signals in different \n\nfrequencies while progressing landwards. Spectral density plots were constructed using the \n\nspectrum function of MATLAB on hourly data to determine the power spectrum. Here, \n\npower is defined as energy per unit time. \n\nCross-spectral analysis was applied to two pairs of time series: water temperature \n\nand water level, as well as water temperature and air temperature. Before the calculations \n\nwere made both high and low-pass filters were applied to all time series. The cross-spectral \n\nanalysis (8 Hanning windows) provides: a co-spectrum (real part of the spectrum), which \n\ndefines the relationship between the two variables (if these variables are completely \n\nindependent the spectrum is zero, and if they are identical it becomes the ordinary power \n\nspectrum); a coherence spectrum, which indicates how well correlated the two sequences \n\nare as a function of frequency and a phase spectrum, which quantifies the data time lag.  \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nMaterials and Methods  11 \n\nEmpirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis provides a convenient method for \n\nstudying the spatial and temporal variability of long time series of the water temperature \n\ndata over large areas. Among the various available methods of analysis, this one is a \n\nparticularly useful tool to study large quantities of multi-variate data. \n\nEOF analysis divides the temporal variance of the data into orthogonal spatial \n\npatterns called empirical eigenvectors and establishes spatial patterns of variability. \n\nMoreover it is computed the associated time variation to each EOF and also assigned a \n\nvalue of \u201cimportance\u201d to each pattern (Bjornsson and Venegas, 1997). In other words, EOF \n\nanalysis is used to decompose a time-series into its orthogonal component modes, the first \n\nfew of which can be used to describe the dominant patterns of variance in the time series. \n\nThe lowest modes have the largest spatial scales and represent the most dominant modes of \n\nvariability. This method is fully described in Emery and Thompson (1997). \n\nIn order to established the relation between the temporal variation of the water \n\ntemperature inside the channel and the inter-annual variability of the air temperature, the \n\ncorrelation between the first principal component (PC1) of the first EOF and the air \n\ntemperature was calculated. \n\nFinally, correlations between the water temperature measured in the sensors and the \n\nforcing variables (tide, air temperature, sea surface temperature) were also calculated.  \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nMaterials and Methods  12 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nObservations and environmental data  13 \n\n4 Observations and environmental data \n\n4.1 Meteorological conditions \n\nIn Figure 4.1 are plotted the hourly values of air temperature and precipitation and \n\ndaily values of wind velocity measured at the Aveiro meteorological station from October \n\n2004 to October 2005.  \n\nThe annual average temperature during this period is 15.3 \u00baC; the average \n\ntemperature for Winter months is 9.3 \u00baC, and for Summer months is 20.2 \u00baC. In the last \n\nmonths of the study period the air temperature reaches unusual high values, such as 35.5 \u00baC \n\nin the beginning of June 2005 and 38.2 \u00baC in the mid-July 2005. \n\nThe rainy season was the Autumn of 2004, reaching a daily maximum of about 58 \n\nmm. During the other seasons almost there was no precipitation in this zone (severe \n\ndrought). The only exception was in March where some rainfall existed. According to \n\nFonseca et al. (1988) the annual average precipitation in Aveiro region is 913.5 mm. Since \n\nthere was almost no precipitation during the study period, the river flow was considerably \n\nlower than the typical values. \n\n \nFigure 4.1: Air temperature, precipitation and wind velocity in Aveiro meteorological station, from \nOctober 2004 to October 2005. \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nObservations and environmental data  14 \n\nThe wind velocity maximum was found in the beginning of Winter and in the \n\nbeginning of Autumn, reaching a daily maximum of 15 and 18 ms-1. The mean values of \n\nwind velocity remain almost constant during all year with values around 3.7 ms-1. Figure \n\n4.1 also shows high frequency of winds blowing from North and Northwest directions. \n\nThese northern winds are characteristic of the Summer season. In the Winter the wind \n\nregime is more variable, with strong fluctuations in direction and intensity, with \n\npredominance winds blowing from South and Southwest. \n\n4.2 Tides \n\nFigure 4.2 shows (as example) the time series for a 26-day period of hourly values of \n\nthe water level. \n\nThe tide was semi-diurnal with a diurnal inequality. A minimum water level of 0.6 m \n\nand a maximum water level of 3.3 m in the spring tide have been observed. The minimum \n\ntidal amplitude during this period was 1.3 m at neap tide and the maximum amplitude at \n\nspring tide was 2.65 m.  \n\n \nFigure 4.2: Time series of the water level. Hourly records (1 to 26 February 2005). \n\n \n\n4.3 Water flow \n\nFigure 4.3 shows the tidal lunar water flow determined using measurements of \n\nelectrical potential difference in mouth of the Ria de Aveiro for the complete data set \n\n(Figure 4.3a) and 26-day period (Figure 4.3b).  \n\n The water flow has a similar behavior to the tide (as expected). These data are used \n\nonly to characterize the water exchange between the Ria de Aveiro and the near ocean. The \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nObservations and environmental data  15 \n\nwater transport during the flooding is responsible for the ocean water entrance into the \n\nestuary. \n\nThe average values of total flow through the inlet during flood and ebb for spring \n\nand neap tide were computed (Figure 4.3b). During spring tide, the average value of water \n\nflow passing across the bar during the flood period is 4239.1 m3s-1 and during the ebb \n\nperiod is 4260.4 m3s-1. During neap tide, the average value during flood is 2540.2 m3s-1 \n\nand during the ebb is 2813.3 m3s-1. From these results it may be concluded that during this \n\nperiod the water exchange is greater in the ebb. The highest values of water flow are found \n\nin spring tide, and the lowest in neap tide, reinforcing the importance of the fortnight \n\nmodulation in Ria de Aveiro. \n\n \nFigure 4.3: Tidal lunar water flow in mouth of the Ria de Aveiro. a) Records obtained between 6 \nJanuary and 30 March 2005; b) Records obtained between 1 and 26 February 2005. \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nObservations and environmental data  16 \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  17 \n\n5 Results and Discussion \n\n5.1 Spatial variability \n\nFigure 5.1 shows the average water temperature distribution along the Espinheiro \n\nchannel. These figures are obtained by monthly-averaging the water temperature data from \n\neach sensor. The field data for sensor 16 (7.5 km) does not exist, as previously referred. \n\nIn general, it can be observed that the water temperature values decay from Autumn \n\nto Winter. During the Winter months, water temperature is nearly constant along the \n\nchannel, but slightly decreasing towards the channel\u2019s head (the oceanic water temperature \n\nis usually higher than the freshwater temperature). In Summer, the water temperature \n\ndistribution along the channel follows the same pattern. Two minima (12-14 \u00baC) in \n\npositions 2.5 and 3.5 km and one maximum (18-20 \u00baC) at 5.5 km from the mouth are \n\nobserved. \n\nIn the mouth of the channel, the water temperature ranges from 14 \u00baC during Winter to \n\n17/18 \u00baC during the Summer. Near the channel\u2019s head, which is the fluvial region, the \n\nwater temperature ranges from 12 \u00baC during Winter to 16/17 \u00baC during Summer. The \n\nmeasurements show that the water temperature values in the mouth during Summer months \n\nare higher than those measured in the channel\u2019s head, revealing a tendency opposed to \n\nwhat would be expectable. This fact may be explained by a river flow lower than the \n\ntypical values during the study period.  \n\nThe difference between the inlet ocean temperature and the temperature at the far \n\nend of the channel can reach 2 \u00baC (in Winter season), these spatial differences being \n\nimportant in the net export of heat energy from the lagoon toward offshore waters. \n\nFor the entire survey period, the water temperature between positions 2.5 and 3.5 km \n\nis the lowest. This fact may be explained by the sensors location in the S\u00e3o Jacinto and \n\nEspinheiro channels convergence, where on ebb the water temperature could be lower, as it \n\nwas recorded in these sensors (the water that leaves the S\u00e3o Jacinto channel could be \n\ncolder than the water that comes from the upstream area of the Espinheiro channel). This \n\nmay also be due to some technical problems affecting these sensors. \n\nBetween positions 5.5 and 6.5 km the water temperature presents its maximum \n\nvalues during Spring and Summer (about 20 \u00baC). This may be explained by the channel\u2019s \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  18 \n\nshallowness, and by the key role of the meteorological variables like air temperature and \n\nsolar radiation in the water heating/cooling cycle. \n\nThe water temperature distribution is less dependent on the river discharge and it is \n\nclosely related to the inter-annual air temperature variation (Figure 4.1). As, in the study \n\nperiod the river flow was quasi null. Therefore this forcing should be considered of minor \n\nimportance in the characterization of the longitudinal water temperature distribution during \n\nthe study period. \n\n \nFigure 5.1: Mean water temperature along the Espinheiro channel. \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  19 \n\n5.1.1 Harmonic analysis \n\nThe importance of each tidal constituent on the water temperature distribution along \n\nthe Espinheiro channel can be evaluated through the application of the classical harmonic \n\nanalysis (Pawlowicz et al., 2002) to the data. The results for six major tidal constituents \n\n(K1-23.93 h (principal solar); S1-24 h (radiational); P1-24.07 h (principal solar); S2-12 h \n\n(principal solar); T2-12.02 h (larger elliptical solar); M2-12.42 h (principal lunar)), are \n\nplotted in Figure 5.2. \n\nThrough the analysis of Figure 5.2a, it can be observed that the major tidal \n\nconstituent is S1 (about 1.4 \u00baC of amplitude along the channel), revealing the diurnal \n\nperiodicity and the importance of the meteorological variables (air temperature, relative \n\nhumidity, cloud cover and solar radiation) on the water heating/cooling cycle. S2 is the \n\nconstituent that follows in amplitude (about 0.3 \u00baC) but only in some parts of the channel, \n\nspecifically between positions 1-5 km and 8-9 km. In positions 0.5, 5.5, 6 and 8.5 km M2 is \n\nthe highest (about 0.4 \u00baC), as expected, since M2 has most of the tidal energy in Ria de \n\nAveiro and for this reason can be considered representative of the tide in this lagoon (Dias \n\net al., 1999). \n\nThe other constituents, such as T2, P1 and K1, have similar amplitudes (about 0.15 \u00baC \n\nalong the channel).  \n\nIn Figure 5.2b, it can be observed that the phase of the harmonic constituents \n\nincrease along the channel. The water temperature propagation along the channel is altered \n\nby the channel bathymetry. A change in the estuarine bathymetry will most often alter the \n\ncirculation within an estuary (Harcourt-Baldwin and Diedericks, 2006).  \n\nBetween positions 5.5 and 6.5 km the phase is about 92\u00ba (almost 6.3 hours) for the S1 \n\nconstituent and about 350\u00ba (almost 12.1 hours) for the M2 constituent. In these positions, \n\nthere is a rapid phase change due to an increase in the friction (a shallow area). More \n\nspecifically, the phase of the diurnal constituents decreases and the phase of the \n\nsemidiurnal ones increases. This may be due to the fact the phases of harmonic \n\nconstituents are mainly affected by friction while their amplitudes are both damped by \n\nfriction and amplified or eventually diminished by the geometry along the channel (Hsu et \n\nal., 1999). \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  20 \n\n \nFigure 5.2: Distribution of tidal amplitude (a) and phase (b) for S1, K1, P1, M2, S2 and T2 along the \nEspinheiro channel. \n \n \n\n5.2 Temporal variability \n\nIn this section the temporal variability along the Espinheiro channel is studied and \n\nfor reasons of simplification, the following steps of this work will not include results for all \n\nsensors. The selection was made taking into account the sensors location and general \n\ncontribution to the comprehension of the system and so only the sensors that exhibited \n\nmore important characteristics for the study were selected. The selected studied sites were: \n\nsensor 1, located near the Barra of Aveiro, which is of interest to the study because it \n\nmeasures water characteristics very similar to seawater; sensor 2, located between the tide-\n\ngauge and Tri\u00e2ngulo das Mar\u00e9s; sensor 6, located in the beginning of the S\u00e3o Jacinto \n\nchannel; sensor 10, located at beginning of the \u00cdlhavo channel, which is interesting to \n\nunderstand the importance of the water exchange between the Espinheiro channel and the \n\nadjacent channels; sensor 13, located in a shallow area and where the temperature recorded \n\nby the sensors is higher; finally, sensor 19, which presents a location near the mouth of the \n\nVouga River, whose contribution as a main source of freshwater into the Espinheiro \n\nchannel is generally non- negligible.  \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  21 \n\nWith the purpose of analyzing the results as a function of frequency, they were \n\ndecomposed into high and low frequencies, using the filter referred on Section 3.2. The \n\ninfluence of the meteorological forcing in the time series is recognizable through the \n\napplication of a low-pass filter (subtidal frequencies), while the high-pass filter shows \n\nevidence of tidal forcing (tidal frequencies).  \n\nFrom Figure 5.3 to Figure 5.8 both the original and filtered time series of the water \n\ntemperature measured in sensors 1, 2, 6, 10, 13 and 19 are represented. \n\nIn general, all sensors measure similar temperature variations throughout the year. \n\nThere is evidence of seasonal variation, as the water temperature is lower in Winter and \n\nhigher in Summer, which is observed in all sensors. This seasonal variation is mainly \n\nobserved at the low frequencies, and it dictates the behavior of the time series in terms of \n\nlong term general variability. The high frequencies, on the contrary, are responsible for the \n\ndaily variation and do not contribute to the global pattern of variation. The water \n\ntemperature measured by sensor 6 has a quasi-constant pattern during the whole year. \n\nIn the subtidal frequencies, a similar pattern can be observed for all sensors (with the \n\nexception of sensor 6), which revealed a general trend for water heating during the \n\nSummer months and for water cooling during the Winter months. Consequently,  the water \n\ntemperature can vary \u00b1 5 \u00baC due to the long term processes, which can be attributed to the \n\nwarming/cooling global effects inherent to the dynamics of the planet throughout the \n\nseasons. In the tidal frequencies, the solar heating effect can clearly be observed, \n\nreinforced by the semidiurnal and diurnal effect the tidal origin. \n\nAt the subtidal frequencies, the pattern obtained for Ria de Aveiro is dictated by \n\nweather and/or meteorological long term events. The increase of the subtidal oscillations is \n\ngreater in Winter than in Summer, which is likely to be related to sudden changes in the \n\nmeteorological conditions over the area, shown in the abrupt changes in wind direction in \n\nFigure 4.1. The low frequencies and the wind velocity have similar patterns. Strong winds \n\nresulted in changes in the water temperature. Depending on the direction, they will either \n\ncause a decrease if blowing southwards or an increase if blowing northwards (e.g. on \n\nJulian day 320 (15 November) the wind velocity was 18 ms-1 and the water temperature \n\ndiminishes by 1 \u00baC). Harcourt-Baldwin and Diedericks (2006) showed that the wind has a \n\nstrong influence on the formation of a density current in Tomales Bay. In the lower \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  22 \n\nChesapeake Bay, Paraso and Valle-Levinson (1996) found that the wind forcing were \n\nresponsible for the horizontal water temperature gradient. \n\nObserving in more detail, in Figure 5.3a and Figure 5.4a the behavior of the water \n\ntemperature is similar, what may be explained by the very short distance between these \n\nsensors. The mean of the water temperature measured in these sensors is about 16 \u00baC. The \n\nwater temperature measured in these sensors is mainly influenced by the tide and the \n\noceanic water temperature (due to the proximity of the sea). The temperature at the \n\nentrance of the mouth exhibits strong tidal fluctuations and a diurnal inequality.  \n\nIn Figure 5.5a, the water temperature is low (about 13 \u00baC) independently of the \n\nseason for the whole study period. As previously mentioned, it may be due to the sensors \n\nlocation in the S\u00e3o Jacinto and Espinheiro channels convergence. However, there is \n\nevidence of two maxima around Julian days 259 (16 September) and 299 (26 October) of \n\n17.9 \u00baC and 18.7 \u00baC, respectively. The first maximum is observed in the low frequencies (3 \n\n\u00baC) (Figure 5.5c); this may be due to the occurrence of a strong change in the wind \n\ndirection, as can be observed in Figure 4.1, where the wind changes from southward to \n\nnorthward. This maximum is observed in all time series. The second maximum is observed \n\nin the high frequencies (5.6 \u00baC).  \n\nThe water temperature measured in sensor 13 (Figure 5.7a), located about 1.5 km of \n\nsensor 10 (Figure 5.6a), presents a similar behavior (the mean of the water temperature is \n\nabout 16.5 \u00baC), probably due to the higher air temperatures and the shallowness of these \n\nsensors location (a decrease in depth resulted in warmer water temperatures) (Figure 3.2). \n\nThe maximum temperatures measured in these sensors are reached at the far end of the \n\nchannel, where the tidal effect is not so strong. The mean of the water temperature \n\nmeasured in sensor 19 (Figure 5.8a) is 14.8 \u00baC. The decrease of the water temperature in \n\nthis sensor may be explained, by its location near the mouth of the Vouga River. Although \n\nthe river flow was reduced, it can have some influence on the water temperature. \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  23 \n\n \nFigure 5.3: Original (a) and filtered time series of the water temperature measured in sensor 1, \nshowing the high (b) and low frequencies (c). \n\n \nFigure 5.4: Original (a) and filtered time series of the water temperature measured in sensor 2, \nshowing the high (b) and low frequencies (c). \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  24 \n\n \nFigure 5.5: Original (a) and filtered time series of the water temperature measured in sensor 6, \nshowing the high (b) and low frequencies (c). \n\n \nFigure 5.6: Original (a) and filtered time series of the water temperature measured in sensor 10, \nshowing the high (b) and low frequencies (c). \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  25 \n\n \nFigure 5.7: Original (a) and filtered time series of the water temperature measured in sensor 13, \nshowing the high (b) and low frequencies (c). \n\n \nFigure 5.8: Original (a) and filtered time series of the water temperature measured in sensor 19, \nshowing the high (b) and low frequencies (c). \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  26 \n\n5.2.1 Spectral analysis \n\nSpectral density plots were used to determine the power spectrum and to find any \n\nperiodic phenomena. Before performing the spectral analysis, the time series trend and \n\nmean was removed. Energy spectral density plots of the water temperature measured in \n\nsensors 1, 2, 6, 10, 13 and 19 are depicted in Figure 5.9. \n\nThe most energetic peaks are found at the diurnal and semidiurnal frequencies, but \n\ncontributions at tridiurnal and quarterdiurnal tidal frequencies were also found. The energy \n\nspectrum also presents energetic subtidal oscillations (LP). Results also indicate that \n\nsubtidal processes are usually less energetic than the diurnal oscillations, except in \n\nsituations of extreme events, when the subtidal frequencies are amplified along the \n\nchannel. Subtidal processes are more energetic than semidiurnal and quarterdiurnal \n\noscillations and have frequencies varying from 3 to 23 days.  \n\nIn all sensors spectra, two main peaks are observed: one diurnal and one semidiurnal. \n\nThe diurnal peak is the most energetic (almost 10 times higher) (in sensors 1, 2, 6, 10 and \n\n19), revealing the importance of the heating solar on the heating/cooling cycle of the water. \n\nIn sensor 13 spectrum, three main peaks are observed, one diurnal, one semidiurnal and \n\none quarterdiurnal. The semidiurnal peak is the most energetic one, but with a slight \n\ndifference to the diurnal peak. The semidiurnal peak is associated to the tidal main \n\nperiodicity in Ria de Aveiro. The peaks corresponding to the 3 and 4 cycles/day frequency \n\nare probably originated by the non-linear interaction between the propagation of the main \n\ntidal constituents and the bottom friction, as that sensor is located in a shallow area (Figure \n\n3.2). Concerning sensor 19, the same effect can be observed, but the diurnal peak is more \n\nenergetic than the semidiurnal one (see Figure 5.2).  \n\nThe diurnal peak importance in the spectrum can be explained as follows: the Ria de \n\nAveiro is a shallow water estuarine system with mean depth of about 1 m (over the local \n\ndatum), and the water temperature is conducted not only by the tide, that has an important \n\ncontribute at these frequencies, but also by heating from solar radiation incidence and air \n\ntemperature daily variability. The semidiurnal peak in spectrum of the water temperature is \n\nrelated to the water input due to the tidal wave propagation along the channel. The results \n\nof the spectral analysis confirm the harmonic analysis results (Figure 5.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  27 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure 5.9: Energy spectrum of the time series of water temperature measured in sensors 1, 2, 6, 10, 13 \nand 19. The vertical bar indicates a 95% confidence level. \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  28 \n\n5.2.2 Cross-spectral analysis \n\nThe tides are the main forcing of the circulation in the Ria de Aveiro. In order to \n\ndeterminate the relationship between the water level and water temperature measured in \n\nsensors 1, 2, 6, 10 and 13, and also to obtain the phase difference and the coherence, the \n\ncross-spectral analysis was applied to the data (Figure 5.10 to Figure 5.15).   \n\nIn general, through the analysis of these figures, it can be observed that the water \n\ntemperature and the water level reveal more significant coherence in sensor 2.  \n\nConsidering now only Figure 5.11, we can see that the water temperature and water \n\nlevel were coherent at frequencies between 1 (0.55) and 2 cycles/day (0.75). This highest \n\ncorrelation reveals that heat is transported significantly by the tide from the nearly ocean. \n\nAt these frequencies the co-spectral density function indicates that the oscillations of the \n\nwater level are well correlated, in particular at the semidiurnal frequencies (due to the \n\nproximity of the sea). For this semidiurnal period, the phase lag obtained between the two \n\nparameters is 2.54\u00ba, which corresponds to 5.5 minutes. The minimum of the water \n\ntemperature measured in sensor 2 has a phase lag of 5.5 minutes, relative to the high tide in \n\nBarra.  \n\n \nFigure 5.10: Cross spectrum, coherence and phase between the water level in Barra and the water \ntemperature measured in the sensor 1. \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  29 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.11: Cross spectrum, coherence and phase between the water level in Barra and the water \ntemperature measured in the sensor 2. \n\n \nFigure 5.12: Cross spectrum, coherence and phase between the water level in Barra and the water \ntemperature measured in the sensor 6. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  30 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.13: Cross spectrum, coherence and phase between the water level in Barra and the water \ntemperature measured in the sensor 10. \n\n \nFigure 5.14: Cross spectrum, coherence and phase between the water level in Barra and the water \ntemperature measured in the sensor 13. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  31 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.15: Cross spectrum, coherence and phase between the water level in Barra and the water \ntemperature measured in the sensor 19. \n \n \n\nIn Figure 5.12 it can be observed that in semidiurnal frequencies, the co-spectrum \n\npresents negative values, which means that when the tidal range increases, the water \n\ntemperature decreases. \n\nThe cross spectrum obtained between the water level in Barra and the water \n\ntemperature measured in sensors 10 and 13 has not high coherence in any frequency band, \n\nas observed, indicating that the influence of the tide in these areas is small. Sensor 10 is \n\nlocated at the beginning of the \u00cdlhavo channel, where the tidal prism in this channel is \n\nabout 13.5% relative to the tidal prism at the mouth (Dias, 2001). The tidal effect may be \n\nattenuated whenever there is convergence of two channels. In other words, the tide is \n\ndistorted as it progress from the mouth towards the end of the channels. \n\nBut at Figure 5.15 the spectra reveal the existence of energy peaks corresponding to \n\nthe first harmonics of the semidiurnal constituents (coherence of about 0.5), revealing the \n\nimportance of the shallow water constituents in a system like the Espinheiro channel. \n\nResults for the cross-spectral-analysis obtained between the water level in Barra and \n\nwater temperature measured in sensor 18 (not shown) shows that they were coherent (0.6) \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  32 \n\nat the semidiurnal frequencies. For this semidiurnal period, the phase lag obtained between \n\nthe two parameters is 169.5\u00ba, which corresponds to 5.85 hours and the minimum of the \n\nwater temperature measured in sensor 18 (8.5 km from the mouth). \n\nResults show that the semidiurnal and diurnal frequencies are attenuated from the \n\nmouth to the far end of the channel, and that there is significant phase delay between the \n\nmouth and each sensor. Ria de Aveiro is a very shallow lagoon with a very complex \n\ngeometry and for these reasons distortion occurs as the tidal wave propagates along the \n\nshallow channels. \n\nThe air temperature is an important factor in the determination of the water \n\ntemperature variability. In this way it is important to evaluate the phase lag between the air \n\ntemperature and the water temperature measured in the sensors distributed along the \n\nEspinheiro channel and so the cross-spectral analysis was applied to the data (Figure 5.16 \n\nto Figure 5.21). \n\nIn general, the co-spectrum, coherence and phase spectra show that the time series of \n\nair temperature and the water temperature measured in each sensor have a coherence of \n\nalmost 1 at the diurnal frequencies. At this frequency the co-spectral density function \n\nindicates that the oscillations between the air temperature and the water temperature at \n\neach sensor are well correlated. \n\nThe negative values in the co-spectrum and the behavior of phase spectra show that \n\nthe air temperature at the station is out of phase by approximately 180\u00ba relative to each \n\nsensor.  \n\nResults for the cross-analysis obtained between the air temperature and water \n\ntemperature measured in sensor 1 (Figure 5.16), show that they are coherent (0.83) at the \n\ndiurnal frequencies. For this diurnal period, the phase lag obtained between the two \n\nparameters is -145.2\u00ba, but the diurnal peak of the co-spectrum is negative (180\u00ba-145.2\u00ba), \n\nwhich corresponds to the 2.32 hours. In other words, 2.32 hours is the time of response of \n\nthe water temperature to undergo the influence of the air temperature. It is also visible in \n\nthis figure that, in the low frequency band (about 10 days), the two variables were coherent \n\n(0.5), with lower energy than the diurnal peak. The same occurs in Figure 5.18 however, \n\nthe coherence decreases significantly, indicating that the influence of the prescribed low \n\nfrequency oscillations in these areas is small. \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  33 \n\nFigure 5.19 shows that the water temperature measured in sensor 10 and the air \n\ntemperature were coherent at the diurnal frequencies. This sensor is located in a shallow \n\narea (~ 4 m). The phase lag is -150\u00ba, which corresponds to 2 hours, while in Figure 5.20 is \n\nof -157.3\u00ba, in this case corresponding to 1.5 hours. As it can be observed, the time of \n\nresponse of the water temperature to undergo the influence of the air temperature decreases \n\nas it goes further into the channel (the water column height decreases) (see Figure 3.2). \n\nThis means that the temperature of the estuarine water column is controlled by the solar \n\nradiation. A similar result was found by Sep\u00falveda et al. (2004) in the Rio de la Plata \n\nestuary. \n\nIn summary, the water temperature distribution along the Espinheiro channel closely \n\nfollowed the air temperature and was modulated by tidal variations. The solar radiation \n\nheating effect is important for the establishment of temperature patterns, especially in the \n\nsallow areas at the far end of the channel. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.16: Cross spectrum, coherence and phase between the air temperature and the water \ntemperature measured in the sensor 1. \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  34 \n\n \nFigure 5.17: Cross spectrum, coherence and phase between the air temperature and the water \ntemperature measured in the sensor 2. \n\n \nFigure 5.18: Cross spectrum, coherence and phase between the air temperature and the water \ntemperature measured in the sensor 6. \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  35 \n\n \nFigure 5.19: Cross spectrum, coherence and phase between the air temperature and the water \ntemperature measured in the sensor 10. \n\n \nFigure 5.20: Cross spectrum, coherence and phase between the air temperature and the water \ntemperature measured in the sensor 13. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  36 \n\n \nFigure 5.21: Cross spectrum, coherence and phase between the air temperature and the water \ntemperature measured in the sensor 19. \n \n \n\n5.3 Spatial- temporal variability \n\n5.3.1 Seasonal variability  \n\nFigure 5.22 shows the spatial-temporal pattern of water temperature in the \n\nEspinheiro channel. Through the analysis of this figure, it can be observed that in Winter \n\nthe channel\u2019s mouth presents higher water temperature values than the channel\u2019s head. In \n\nthe Summer months the channel\u2019s head presents smaller water temperature than the mouth, \n\nas revealing a tendency opposed to what would be expectable. This may be explained by \n\nthe fact the river flow was very low during the period under analysis. Then, the colder \n\nwaters of the ocean mixed with the estuarine water in the channel\u2019s head, causing a \n\ndecrease of the water temperature in that area. \n\nIt may be observed that the oceanic water temperature has a larger annual variability \n\nwhen compared to the seasonal fluvial water temperature variability, which presents a \n\nsmaller range. \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  37 \n\n \nFigure 5.22: Seasonal representation of the water temperature variability. Color bar shows \ntemperature in (\u00baC). \n\n \n\nFrom Autumn to Winter, the water temperature in the inner part of the channel \n\ndecreases almost 5 \u00baC, from values between 16 and 18 \u00baC to values between 11 and 13 \u00baC. \n\nThis effect can be due, not only to the temperature of the ocean and river waters but also, \n\nto the decrease of the air temperature (Figure 4.1) and the shallowness of these areas. A \n\nsimilar result was found by Uncles and Stephens (2001) in the Tamar estuary. \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  38 \n\nIn Winter, the water temperature is nearly constant along the channel. The \n\nobservations show higher temperatures near the mouth (sensor 1) and lower temperatures \n\nin the upstream zone of the channel.  \n\nFrom Winter to Spring the water in the inner part of the channel becomes warmer \n\nincreasing from about 11 \u00baC to 17 \u00baC at the end of the Spring. At this time of the year, the \n\nair temperature starts to increase (see Figure 4.1). This may be due to an increase in the air \n\ntemperature and solar radiation. \n\nIn fact, starting from the middle of Spring to the middle of Autumn, warmer fluvial \n\nwaters (sensor 19) enter the channel. The opposite occurs during colder seasons when \n\nwarmer waters come into the channel from the sea. Near the fluvial region of the channel, \n\nthe water temperature values are always 2 \u00baC warmer or cooler, depending on the year \n\nseason, than in the rest of the channel.  \n\nThe water temperature recorded by sensors 6 and 8 is low independently of the \n\nmonth (around 12 \u00baC). \n\nIn Summer, the water temperature within the channel increases to values higher than \n\n24 \u00baC in sensor 13, which can be due to the fact that it is located in a shallow area (Figure \n\n3.2), reflecting the influence of the solar radiation daily variability. The oceanic and fluvial \n\nboundaries of the channel have similar water temperature variations. This result is in \n\nagreement with Vaz and Dias (2008) for Autumn and Winter seasons. \n\nThrough the analysis of Figure 5.22, it may be verified that, for all seasons, the warm \n\nor cold waters reach up to sensor 3. \n\nIn order to verify the influence of the tide in transporting the ocean water into the \n\nestuary during the spring and neap tide in Winter and Summer, the water level and the \n\nwater temperature recorded in sensors 1, 3 and 7 are plotted in Figure 5.23 and Figure 5.24 \n\nfor a 21 days-period in December 2004 and July 2005, respectively. \n\nObserving these figures, the water temperature recorded in sensor 1 and 3 presents \n\nsimilar patterns and values, varying with the tide (due to the proximity of the mouth), both \n\nin Winter and Summer. The daily variation in water temperature is also related to the tidal \n\namplitude (the low tide produces an increase in water temperature) (Newton and Mudge, \n\n2003). The water temperature increases at ebb tide and decreases at flood tide. However, in \n\nsensor 7 the tidal effect begins to attenuate, as it is already located 3 km from the mouth. \n\nThis attenuation increases along the channel.  \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  39 \n\n \nFigure 5.23: Water level (panel 1) and water temperature (panel 2) at sensors 1, 2 and 7 for December \n2004. \n\n \nFigure 5.24: Water level (panel 1) and water temperature (panel 2) at sensors 1, 2 and 7 for July 2005. \n\n \nFrom Figure 5.23 and Figure 5.24 it can be observed that the maximum tidal range of \n\n3 m, which represents spring tide conditions, causes a small decrease, approximately 1.5 \n\nand 2.5 \u00baC in water temperature at sensors 1 and 3, respectively. A decrease in the tidal \n\nrange, representing neap tide conditions, causes an increase about 3 \u00baC in water \n\ntemperature data. This fact may be explained by the smaller velocities in neap tide, which \n\ncauses a minor water renovation along the channel. But, the decrease in tidal range during \n\nneap tides results in a shorter tidal excursion within the channel.  \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  40 \n\nIn spring tide conditions, the tidal excursion extends along the entire channel on the \n\nflood tide. However, at 3 km into the channel, the tide begins to attenuate and it continues \n\nto decrease towards the channel\u2019s head.  \n\nThe tidal range is considered an important factor for the differences in the water \n\ntemperature along the channel. These results confirm the ones obtained in Tomales Bay \n\n(Harcourt-Baldwin and Diedericks, 2006) where the tidal range influenced the \n\ndevelopment of a density intrusion, where the tidal range controls whether the cold, dense \n\nwater reaches the plunging area and in so doing, influences whether a density current does \n\nor does not develop. \n\nAs previously observed, the tidal range has an important role in the water \n\ntemperature variation along the channel, mainly in areas near the mouth. Therefore it is \n\nthus appropriate to look to the sea surface temperature values, as they are also likely to \n\nhave a signature in the temperature inside the channel. With the purpose of verifying the \n\ninfluence of the sea surface temperature in the values recorded by the sensors near the \n\nmouth of the lagoon, Figure 5.25 shows the satellite images corresponding to the study \n\nperiod presented in this section. \n\nAccording to Figure 5.25 there is warm seawater (around 18 \u00baC) propagating \n\nupstream on 15 June 2005 as confirmed by Figure 5.22, where the influence of this high \n\ntemperature is observed up to sensor 3. The opposite is observed on 6 July 2005, when \n\ncolder water (around 14 \u00baC) enters in the lagoon, being visible in all sensors data.  \n\nIn Figure 5.25 (6 July 2005) a band of cold water (15-17 \u00baC) can be observed near \n\nthe coast with a length and width of approximately 150 and 50 km, respectively. This may \n\nbe due to upwelling events, which are related to northern winds (Figure 4.1). Probably, the \n\ncold, upwelled water intrudes on the channel with the flood tide (Figure 5.24), because \n\nduring the flood a greater entrance of water flow occurs (Figure 4.3). The ocean water can \n\nbe one of the driving factor that causes water temperature variability in the Espinheiro \n\nchannel. This was also the case within the Tamar estuary (Uncles and Stephens, 2001). \n\nIn this way and to evaluate the influence of the sea surface temperature in the water \n\ntemperature recorded by the sensor near the mouth, correlations were calculated based on \n\ntime series data represented in Figure 5.26. \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  41 \n\n \nFigure 5.25: MODIS images of sea surface temperature. \n\n \n\nThe Figure 5.26 presents the similar behavior of the variables. The water temperature \n\nmeasured in sensor 1 between Julian days 152 and 188 is higher (about 0.5 \u00baC) than sea \n\nsurface temperature. This difference can be due to the fact that a comparison between \n\nwater temperature measured at a depth ~20 m and water temperature measured at the \n\nsurface (satellite). This may also be a consequence of the weakness of the river flow, since \n\nthe water column is completely filled with oceanic water (homogeneous water column) \n\n(Vaz and Dias, 2008). \n\nIn fact, the sea surface temperature is moderately correlated to the air temperature \n\n(0.6569) (as expected), because the solar radiation has a direct influence in the heating of \n\nthe water. The sea surface temperature is strongly correlated to the water temperature \n\nmeasured in sensor 1 (0.9498) and sensor 2 (0.8878), showing a diminishing of the \n\ncorrelation towards the channel\u2019s head, which indicates that, due to the shallowness of the \n\nupper regions of the channel, the water temperature dynamics is also driven by the air \n\ntemperature variation.  \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  42 \n\n \nFigure 5.26: Time series of the sea surface temperature, water temperature measured in sensor 1 and \nair temperature. \n \n\n5.3.2 Empirical Orthogonal Functions analysis \n\nThe decomposition of water temperature using empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) \n\nprovides another method of analyzing the spatial and temporal components of water \n\ntemperature variability. EOFs analysis is used to ascertain the most significant coherent \n\nmode of variation in the channel.  \n\nThe highest coherent component (the first EOF) (Figure 5.27) explains 85% of the \n\ntotal variance of the water temperature inside the channel. \n\n \nFigure 5.27: Spatial (a) and temporal (b) distribution of the water temperature first EOF. \n \n\nThe first Principal Component (PC1) (Figure 5.27b) is closely related to the inter-\n\nannual variation of the air temperature. The first EOF (Figure 5.27a) presents a non-\n\nhomogeneous behavior along the channel. In sensors 6 and 8 are shown the smallest \n\nvariation (the water temperature is low independently of the month) and sensors 12 and 13 \n\nshow the highest variation (Figure 5.22). This may be a consequence of the air temperature \n\n(a)  (b) \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nResults and Discussion  43 \n\nvariation throughout the year. The correlations between the water temperature measured in \n\nthe sensors and the PC1, and the correlations between the water and air temperature data \n\nare summarized in Table 5.1.  \n\nIn fact, strong correlations were found between the temporal variation of the first \n\nEOF (PC1) and all water temperature data. Moreover, strong correlations were also found \n\nbetween water and air temperature. The exception is the correlations found at sensors 6 and \n\n8. The PC1 is strongly correlated to the seawater temperature (0.9498) (sensor 1) and to the \n\nfreshwater temperature (0.9560) (sensor 19), and is moderately correlated to the air \n\ntemperature (0.6790). \nTable 5.1: Correlations between the water temperature measured in the sensors and the PC1, and the \ncorrelations between the water and air temperature.

These peaks values may be related to the \n\ninfluence of the solar heating and also due to the fact that the water that leaves the S\u00e3o \n\nJacinto channel could be colder than the water that comes from the upstream area of the \n\nEspinheiro channel.  \n\nThe results for the Espinheiro channel clearly indicate that the oscillations of the \n\nwater temperature are strongly related to the solar heating daily variation and the \n\nsemidiurnal and diurnal tidal effect. On the other hand, the subtidal oscillations are dictated \n\nby the weather and/or meteorological long term events.  \n\nThe spectral analysis (for the water temperature data) reveals high energy peaks in \n\nboth semidiurnal and diurnal frequencies. These frequencies may be related to the daily \n\nvariation of the air temperature and tidal forcing, demonstrating the importance of the \n\nmeteorological variables in the modulation of the water temperature in shallow areas like \n\nthe Espinheiro channel.  \n\nThis study indicates that the harmonic analysis of the water temperature is an \n\nalternative way of estimating the importance of the tidal constituents along the channel. \n\nThe water temperature measured in sensor 2 (close to the lagoon mouth) showed the \n\nhighest coherence (0.75) with the tide. This highest coherence revealed that heat is \n\ntransported significantly from the nearly ocean. In spring tide conditions, the tidal \n\nexcursion extends along the entire channel during the flood tide, causing the water \n\ntemperature to decrease. However, at 3 km into the channel, the tide effect begins to \n\nattenuate and it continues to decrease towards the channel\u2019s head. In neap tide conditions, \n\nthe water temperature increases about 3 \u00baC, but results in a shorter tidal excursion within \n\nthe channel. \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nConclusions  46 \n\nResults for the cross-spectral analysis obtained between the air temperature and \n\nwater temperature showed that the solar radiation heating effect is important for the \n\nestablishment of temperature patterns, especially in the shallow areas at the far end of the \n\nchannel. \n\nEOF analysis indicates that the variability in the water temperature time series can be \n\naccounted for by the first component, which is closely related to the annual variation of the \n\nair temperature. \n\nThe decrease in the correlation between the water temperature and sea surface \n\ntemperature towards the channel\u2019s head indicates that, due to the shallowness of the upper \n\nregions of the channel, the water temperature dynamics is mainly driven by the air \n\ntemperature variation in this zone. The depth of the channel is another important factor, \n\nwhere a decrease in the depth could result in an increase of the water temperature. \n\nIn conclusion, besides the dependence on the water temperature variation at the \n\nchannel\u2019s boundaries (ocean and river), when the incoming freshwater is low (severe \n\ndrought), the water temperature distribution is closely related to the meteorological \n\nconditions, like air temperature and incoming solar radiation, especially because of the \n\nshallowness of the Espinheiro channel. Specifically, near the mouth of the lagoon the water \n\ntemperature is closely related to the tide and to the air temperature.  \n\nThe results revealed that the fibre Bragg technology produces reliable results and \n\ntherefore it can be used as a pre-operational system to monitor water properties like \n\ntemperature in estuarine systems. \n\nThere are goals that remain for the future. Future work should be conducted to \n\naddress the freshwater inflow data, in order to characterize the influence of the Vouga \n\nRiver freshwater inflow within the channel and evaluate the influence of the seasonal \n\nvariation of freshwater inflow in the water temperature pattern inside the channel. Also, it \n\nshould be interesting to carry out work in modeling in order to compensate the \n\nobservations and in conjunction with data acquired in a continuous real time regime, it will \n\nallow the forecast of the lagoon evolution under critical conditions. \n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\nReferences  47 \n\nReferences \n\nAbrantes, I., Dias, J.
