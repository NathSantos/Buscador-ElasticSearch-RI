This biopolymer can be produced by\nmixed cultures (activated sludge form waste water treatment\nplants) using the volatile fatty acids present in waste streams.\nAlthough the huge potential of this process, its application for\nthe industrial production of PHB still lacks development.\n\nThroughout this work, three different strategies to obtain\nPHB-producing bacteria by using waste streams were tested. In\nthe first one PHB-producing bacteria were first selected by\naerobic dynamic feeding conditions, while simultaneously\nproviding hydrogen gas, followed by an accumulation stage. In\nthe second strategy the conventional aerobic dynamic feeding\nconditions were imposed, followed by an accumulation stage.\nAnd a third one, where a mixed culture was straightly submitted\nto the accumulation stage, without previous selection. Aerobic\ndynamic feeding was operated in cycles og 8 hours (3 cycles\nper day). In the first two strategies, feast phase was intended to\nlast 2h30 and the famine 5h30 for a feast/famine ratio of 0.45.\nWhile the accumulation stage lasted 22 hours.\n\nHigh biomass concentration were achieved using strategy\n1, in a stable reactor, and it was possible to accumulate PHB up\nto 59 % of the VSS with a PHB production yield of 0.30 g SLB/g\nCOD fed. The second strategy resulted in less stable rectors,\nand  a PHB content of 40 % of the VSS was achieved, but with\nPHB production yields as low as 0.09 g PHB/ g COD.\nFurthermore, it was no always possible to produce PHB as\ncarbon source seemed to be directed to other metabolic\npathways. A PHB production yields of 0.31 g PHB/g COD\nconsumed was achieved with the third strategy, although only\nwith a PHB content of 21 % of VSS.\n\nThe production of PHB was verified firstly by a\nthermogravimetric method developed at Avecom previously to\nthis work. This method was replaced by other that comprises the\nextraction of PHB using 1,2 propylene carbonate as solvent.\nThe development of this method is also addressed in this\nproject.\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\nxi\n\nPalavras-chave Polihidroxibutirato (PHB), lamas activadas, efluentes,\nalimenta\u00e7\u00e3o din\u00e2mica aer\u00f3bia (ADF), \u00e1cidos org\u00e2nicos vol\u00e1teis\n(AOV), carbonato de propileno, hidrog\u00e9nio\n\nResumo Polihidroxibutirato \u00e9 um tipo de pl\u00e1stico biodegrad\u00e1vel,\ncompletamente sintetizado por bact\u00e9rias, com propriedades\nsemelhantes aos pl\u00e1sticos convencionais.

A primeira, em que as bact\u00e9rias produtoras de PHB\nforam primeiro selecionadas por condi\u00e7\u00f5es de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o\ndin\u00e2mica aer\u00f3bia, com a alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o simult\u00e2nea de hidrog\u00e9nio,\nseguida de uma fase de acumula\u00e7\u00e3o. Uma segunda estrat\u00e9gia,\nonde a alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o din\u00e2mica aer\u00f3bia foi utilizada, seguida de\numa etapa de acumula\u00e7\u00e3o. E uma terceira, em que uma cultura\nmista foi imediatamente submetida a uma fase de acumula\u00e7\u00e3o,\nsem sele\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00e9via. Nas duas primeiras estrat\u00e9gias a\nalimenta\u00e7\u00e3o din\u00e2mica aer\u00f3bia consistiu em ciclos de 8 horas (3\nciclos por dia), em que se pretendeu-se que a fase de fartura\ndurasse 2h30 A fase de fome por seu lado durou 5h30 para um\nr\u00e1cio fome/fartura de 0.45. A fase de acumula\u00e7\u00e3o durou 22\nhoras.\n\nForam atingidas altas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de biomassa usando\na estrat\u00e9gia 1, num reactor est\u00e1vel, em que foi poss\u00edvel atingir\num conte\u00fado em PHB de 59 % dos SSV, com um rendimento de\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de PHB de 0.30 g SLB/g CQO alimentado. A segunda\nestrat\u00e9gia resultou num reactor menos est\u00e1vel. Um conte\u00fado em\nPHB de 40 % dos SSV foi obtido, embora o rendimento de\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de PHB tenho sido s\u00f3 0.09 g PHB/g CQO. Para al\u00e9m\ndisso, nem sempre foi poss\u00edvel produzir PHB, visto que a fonte\nde carbono parecia ser direcionada para outras vias\nmetab\u00f3licas. Foi atingido um rendimento de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de PHB\nde 0.31  PHB/g CQO na terceira estrat\u00e9gia, no entanto o\nconte\u00fado em PHB foi s\u00f3 21 % dos SSV.\n\nA produ\u00e7\u00e3o de PHB foi inicialmente verificada por um\nm\u00e9todo termogavim\u00e9trico desenvolvido na Avecom previamente\na este trabalho. Este m\u00e9todo foi posteriormente substitu\u00eddo por\noutro que envolve a extra\u00e7\u00e3o de PHB usando carbonato de\npropileno como solvente. O desenvolvimento deste  m\u00e9todo \u00e9\nabordado no presente trabalho.\n\n\n\nxii\n\n\n\nxiii\n\nINDEX\n\n1 INTRODUCTION

The\ncurrent  lifestyle  is  heavily  dependent  on  industry  and  in  the  scientific  and\ntechnological development that supports it [2].\n\nFor many years, this development relied on cheap, abundant and easy to use\nnatural  resources.  In  this  context,  it  was  simpler  and  more  economical  appealing\nto use resource and dispose them and the end of their \"lifetime\", rather than reuse\nthem.  As  a  result,  a  gap  between  industrial  progress  and  the  development  of\nenvironmental technologies was opened, as the cost associated with\nenvironmental protection seemed considerably higher than its return. Therefore,\nresources  were  frequently  used  on  the  basis  of  a  open  cradle-to-grave  cycle,\ninstead of a cradle-to-cradle one. This is highly unsustainable, as it generates\nconsiderable amounts of waste and leads to the depletion of resources [2].\n\nNowadays, the paradigm is starting to shift [3]. New sources of raw material\nhave proven to be expensive and difficult to find [2]. In addition, the cost associated\nwith the proper waste management and disposal is increasing [2, 3]. These\neconomical factors are followed up by a significant social and political pressure, as\nthe  public  grows  unease  towards  its  high  impact  on  the  environment  and\nlegislation is enforced [3].\n\nNew processes and techniques need to be developed and implemented in\norder to comply with the social and environmental laws, while providing\neconomical benefits [2, 3].  This  led  to  the  creation  of  a  new  area  of  industrial\nactivities and to the offspring of environmental companies [4], where biotechnology\ncomprises a significant part [3, 4].\n\n1.1 Valorization of waste streams\n\nWaste streams can cause a significant impact on the environment. Currently,\nindustry is obliged by stiff regulation to properly dispose their waste streams [5].\nThis can be highly expensive and have a hard impact on the economics of their\nactivities [2, 5].\n\nNevertheless, a lot of industries produce waste streams that have actually the\npotential to be used in other processes [5].  Waste  gases  rich  in  carbon  dioxide,  an\n\n\n\n2\n\ninorganic  carbon  source,  and  waste  waters  usually  rich  in  organic  carbon  can  be\nused as substrates in biotechnology processes. At present, these streams are\nusually treated in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) [3].  However,  this  is\nmostly faced as an economic burden as the treatment plants are usually designed\nwith the only purpose of treating the stream and not for its valorization [2].\n\nNowadays, the production of biogas through anaerobic digestion is the most\ncommon process for the valorization of waste water. Biogas is composed by 65%\nof methane and so it can be effectively used as an energy source in the production\nof green electricity. This \"green\" electricity is highly funded which allow\ncompanies to reduce the cost of waste treatment or even to profit from it.\nHowever, this technology requires a significant investment to be installed in a\nWWTP and funds for the production of electricity from biogas are being cut down.\nFurthermore, anaerobic digestion does not efficiently remove nitrogen or\nphosphorus compounds from waste waters. This demands extra treatment steps\nthat  can  be  highly  expensive.   For  these  reasons,  an  alternative  process  for  the\nvalorizations of waste streams is highly desirable.\n\nPolyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are a group of \"bioplastics\" that can be\nsynthesized  by  bacteria,  using  waste  streams  as  feedstock.  They  are  fully\nbiodegradable and exhibit some similar properties to the petroleum based ones.\nTheir production at an industrial scale would occur under aerobic conditions,\nwhich allows microorganisms to uptake nitrogen and phosphorus with the carbon\nsource [6]. That process could be applied in conventional waste water treatment\nplants. Thus, the production of these biopolymers would originate added value,\nwhile conveniently treating waste streams [7].\n\n1.2 Aims and scopes\n\nAlthough promising, the industrial production of PHA is not carried out at\nWWTPs nowadays. This technology still requires development while conventional\nwaste stream treatment technologies are fully developed and successfully applied.\nAs a result, environmental technology companies have their offer of products and\nservices focused on this proven technology. Therefore, expertise in the use of\nwaste  streams  for  the  production  of  PHA  can  be  a  differentiating  factor  for  a\nenvironmental company to withstand among others.\n\nThis  work  was  developed  at  Avecom  NV  (Ghent,  Belgium),  a  SME  (small\nand  medium  sized  enterprise)  specialized  on  environmental  technology.  Its  core\n\n\n\n3\n\nactivity is to develop and provide services and efficient products for industry and\nother  fields  of  activity.  It  has  expertise  in  the  field  of  aquaria  and  aquaculture,\nWWTPs and digesters, and soil remediation, offering services and consultation\nsuch as feasibility studies, sludge analysis, bio-degrading,\nnitrification/denitrification and eco-toxicity tests.\n\nThe  goal  was  to  gain  in-house  know  how  on  the  production  of  PHA  from\nwaste streams and to develop products or services that they could joint to the their\ncurrent  line  of  offers.  In  this,  the  main  objective  was  to  develop  strategies  for  the\nefficient production of PHA by mixed cultures both from gaseous and water waste\nstreams. The development of this process had to have into account the involved\neconomics, so it can be presented as a competitive process to anaerobic digestion.\n\n\n\n4\n\n2 Literature review\n\n2.1 Polyhyroxyalkanoates\n\nPolyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are a family of biopolyesters formed by fatty\nacids. Unlike polylactic acid (PLA) or poly-butylene succinate (PBS) that require\nchemical  polymerization,  PHA  are  the  only  type  of  bioplastics  known  to  be\ncompletely synthesized by microorganisms [6]. Many bacteria are capable of\naccumulate these polymers as internal carbon and energy pools. Their synthesis is\ntriggered  by  growth  limited  conditions,  in  the  presence  of  an  excess  of  carbon\nsource [8].\n\nPHA can present diverse structures and be classified into short-chain length\n(SCL)-PHA, medium-chain-length (MCL)-PHA and long-chain-lenght (LCL)-PHA.\nThis classification is related to the number of carbon atoms in their building\nblocks.  So,  while  SCL-PHA  are  composed  with  monomers  having  3  to  5  carbon\natoms  and  properties  that  are  similar  to  polypropylene,  MCL-PHA  have  6  to  14\ncarbon atoms in their monomers and have elastic properties similar to rubber and\nelastomer [8].  The  LCL-PHA  are  less  studied  and  are  uncommon  to  occur,  being\nconstituted by monomers with more than 14 carbon atoms [9].\n\nFigure 1 - Common PHA monomers.  Short-chain-length monomers:  3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB),\n3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV). Medium-chain-length monomers: 3-hydroxyhexanoate (3HHx),\n3-hydroxyoctanoate (3HO), 3-hydroxydecanoate (3HD), 3-hydroxydodecanoate (3HDD) [6].\n\nThe  diverse  structural  varieties  of  PHA  results  in  a  wide  range  of  different\ncharacteristics, namely melting temperatures (Tm) between 60 and 177 \u00baC, glass\n\n\n\n5\n\ntransition temperatures (Tg) between -50 and 4 \u00baC and thermodegradation\ntemperatures (Td(5%)) between 227 and 256 \u00b0C [6]. Regarding their mechanical\nproperties, they can be either brittle or elastic, presenting a very variable Young\u2019s\nmodulus, an elongation at break ranging from 2 to 1,000% and a tensile strength of\n17 to 104 MPa. Their molecular weight can range between 10,000 and 10,000,000 [6].\nThus these polymers can be molecularly designed to exhibit different properties [6,\n10].\n\nPLA is brittle, yet its tensile strength is the highest among these bacterial\nplastics. Its low glass transition temperature is a handicap for the application of\nthis  bioplastic,  since  it  changes  shape  at  60\u00baC.  In  comparison,  a  PHA  with  a\ndiversified  chain  presents  a  higher  glass  transition  temperature  and  may  more\nsuitable for practical application. PBS is a flexible material, with considerable\nstrength for many applications. Its high thermal decomposition temperature (353\n\u00baC) makes it quite thermostable. Polyethylene (PE) based on bioethanol presents\nthe  same  characteristics  as  the  petroleum-based  PE  and  so  it  can  be  used  for  the\nsame applications. Poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) and poly(p-phenylene)\n(PPP) are two polymers half bio-based, half petroleum-based. While PTT is an\nelastic, ductile material, PPP is highly brittle, hard to process polymer that exhibits\nelectricity-conducting properties [6].\n\nDespite these different properties, all PHA share similar characteristics. They\nare biocompatible and biodegradable thermoplastics, formed by chiral monomers\nand present functional groups [6].  Furthermore  they  are  gas  impermeable  and\nhydrophobic, and present non-linear optical activity and piezoelectrical properties\n[6]. All this makes PHA suitable to be used in a wide range of applications, such as\nedible  packaging  material,  coating  agents,  flavor  delivery  agents  and  it  can  be\nused for making bottles or other containers, cosmetics, films, adhesives, nowoven\nfabrics and ion-conduction materials. PHA can also be used for the production of\nlaminates with other polymers [11].\n\nAs mentioned before, an important characteristic of PHA is their\nbiodegradability. Microorganisms that are able to produce and store\npolyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are usually also capable of degrading and\nmetabolize it when the carbon or energy sources are limited. The decomposition of\nthese polymers into monomers results in (R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid in the case of\npoly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [12] or  in  a  mixture  of  (R)-3-hydroxybutyric  and  (R)-3-\nhydroxyvalerate in the case of the degradation of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-\nhydroxyvalerate) [13].  These  monomers  are  water  soluble  and  can  be  easily\n\n\n\n6\n\nmetabolized by many bacteria to produce carbon dioxide and water under aerobic\nconditions [12, 13].\n\n2.1.1 PHB\n\nPolyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is the most representative PHA. PHB has a very\nlow oxygen permeability, water insolubility and optical purity. Its Young\u2019s\nmodulus and tensile strength are similar to polypropylene, but the elongation at\nbreak is 6% while for polypropylene is 400%. It has a good UV resistance, but poor\nresistance  to  acids  and  bases.  It  is  also  toxicologically  safe,  being  suitable  to  be\nused in the food and feed industry, pharmaceutical and medical applications and\ncosmetics [11].  However,  PHB  may  be  to  brittle  for  many  application  and  in  terms\nof  PHA  processing,  the  production  of  copolymers  appears  to  be  of  a  higher\ncommercial interest [14].\n\n2.2 Industrial Production of Polyhydroxyalkanotes\n\nThrough  the  years,  several  companies,  summarized  in  the  Table  2,  have\ninvested  in   research  and  development  (R&amp;D)  of  PHA  production  process  .  It  is\npossible  to  verify  that  a  representative  part  of  these  companies  already  ceased\ntheir PHA related activity. Recent news revealed that ADM and Metabolix, most\nlikely  the  major  players  in  the  PHA  market,  ended  their  collaboration  for  the\nproduction  of  PHA  due  to  the  lack  of  results  and  huge  losses,  which  may\nrepresent a change of direction for Metabolix [15]. This shows that PHA are more a\n\u201cpotential\u201d then a reality.\n\nTable 1 - Worldwide PHA producing and research companies [8]\n\nCompany Types of PHA\nProduction\n(tons/year)\n\nPeriod Applications\n\nChemie Linz, Austria PHB 20 - 100 1980s Packaging and drug delievery\n\nICI, UK PHBV 300 1980-1990 Packaging\n\nP&amp;G, USA Several PHA Contract manufacteur 1980 \u2013 2005 Packaging\n\nBTF, Austria PHB 20 - 100 1990s Packaging and drug delievery\n\nTianjin Northern Food, China PHB Pilot scale 1990s Raw materials\n\nJiangmen Biotech Center, China PHBHHx Unknown 1990s Raw materials\n\nMonsanto, USA PHB, PHBV Plant PHA production 1990s Raw materials\n\nShantou Lianyi Biotech, China Several PHA Pilot scale 1990 - 2005 Packaging and medicals\n\nBiocycles, Brazil PHB 100 1990 to present Raw materials\n\nBiomers, Germany PHB Unknown 1990s to present Packaging and drug delievery\n\n\n\n7\n\nCompany Types of PHA\nProduction\n(tons/year)\n\nPeriod Applications\n\nJiangsu Nan Tian, China PHB Pilot scale 1990 to present Raw materials\n\nKaneka, Japan (with P&amp;G) Several PHA Unknown 1990 to present Packaging\n\nZhejiang Tian An, China PHBV 2000 1990 to present Raw materials\n\nShenzen O\u2019 Bioer, China Several PHA Unknown 2004 to present Unclear\n\nTianjin Green Bioscience (+DSM) P3HB4HB 10000 2004 to present Raw materials and packaging\n\nADM, USA (with Metabolix) Several PHA 50000 2005 to present Raw materials\n\nShandong Lukang, China Several PHA Pilot scale 2005 to present Raw materials and packaging\n\nMeredian, USA Several PHA 10000 2007 to present Raw materials\n\nBio-On, Italy PHA (unclear) 10000 2008 to present Raw materials\n\nYikeman, Shandong, China PHA (unclear) 3000 2008 to present Raw materials\n\nPHBV poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-(R)-3-hydroxyvalerate], PHB poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate], PHBHHx poly[(R)-3-\nhydroxybutyrate-co-(R)-3-hydroxy-hexanoate], P3HB4HB poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate]\n\nNowadays PHA are mainly produced as raw and packaging material.\nHowever in this market they compete directly with cheaper synthetic polymers or\nwith well established bioplastics, like PLA. While synthetic plastics cost around\n1.0 \u20ac/kg and PLA cost between 2.5 to 5 \u20ac/kg, the price of PHA ranges between 6.6\nto 10.0 \u20ac/kg [16].  This  price  difference  has  been  a  major  barrier  to  the  widely\nacceptance of PHA as a viable alternative to the synthetic plastics.\n\nTo  achieve  the  economical  success  of  PHA  one  of  two  things  must  be\nachieved.  The  first  one  would  be  to  find  a  field  of  application  where  PHA  could\noutstand from the competition of synthetic plastics and their cost overlapped by\ntheir benefits. While the other one would be to implement new technologies of\nproduction  and  recover  in  order  to  decrease  the  cost  of  PHA,  as  their  price\ndepends on the substrate cost, process yield, and downstream process chosen [17].\n\n2.3 Microbial culture\n\nPHA can be produced both by pure cultures as well by open mixed cultures.\nBoth offer some advantages and some disadvantages regarding each other. In this\nsection, these two processes are revised using the microorganism Cupriavidus\nnecator as an model organism for the production of PHA by pure culture.\n\n\n\n8\n\n2.3.1 Mixed Cultures\n\nMixed cultures are microbial populations that operate in open biological\nsystems, like those used in biological wastewater treatment processes. The\nmicrobial composition of this type of cultures depends directly of the influent fed\nand of the operational conditions imposed on the bioreactor [7].\n\nThe capability of mixed cultures to significantly store PHA was observed in\nWWTPs were the activated sludge was submitted to periods of excess and lack of\nexternal carbon source. This happens in systems were selectors for bulking control\nare used [7],  like  for  example  in  WWTPs   that  are  operated  in  Sequencing  Batch\nReactor (SBR) system [18].\n\nAlthough  not  all  the  strains  present  in  these  mixed  cultures  are  capable  of\nproduce  PHA,  it  is  possible  to  enrich  the  cultures  in  PHA-storing  microorganism\nby submitting the microbial community to that type of selective pressure [19]. This\nis usually carried out by submitting the sludge to dynamic conditions, such as\naerobic  dynamic  feeding  (ADF),  also  known  as  feast  and  famine  regime,  or  to  an\nanaerobic/aerobic process [20].\n\nIt was already demonstrated that mixed cultures acclimated through aerobic\ndynamic conditions could accumulate PHA up to 77% cell dry weight[21]. Under\nADF conditions, the microbial population is submitted to alternating high and\nlow/none carbon substrate concentrations [19],  hence  being  known  also  by  \"feast\nand famine\" regime. This transient access to an organic carbon substrate generates\na  so-called  unbalanced  growth.  When  there  is  abundance  of  an  organic  carbon\nsource, the metabolism is directed for the production of PHA. On the other hand,\nafter the exhaustion of the external substrate, the stored polymer is used as an\nenergy and carbon source [14]. Usually this process selects for the Thauera, Azoarcus,\nor Amaricoccus species, depending of the organic acid used as carbon source. These\nidentifications were reported for synthetic substrates [20].\n\nThe anaerobic/aerobic process is based on the capability of polyphosphate\naccumulating organisms (PAOs) and glycogen-accumulating organisms (GAOs) to\naccumulate  PHA  under  anaerobic  conditions.  In  the  presence  of  oxygen,  these\nmicroorganisms use the stored PHA for growth, maintenance and to stock\nglycogen, a second storage polymer. These glycogen pools are used\nsimultaneously  with  the  uptake  of  carbon  sources  from  the  medium,  during  the\nanaerobic phase. The metabolism of these two groups of microorganism is very\nsimilar, with only some differences. PAOs accumulate polyphosphate under\n\n\n\n9\n\naerobic/anoxic conditions, while the PHA is degraded, in order to store energy\nand for growth. This polyphosphate is then degraded and phosphate is released to\nthe  medium  during  the  anaerobic  phase,  giving  energy  to  the  cell  to  accumulate\nPHA.  Meanwhile,  GAOs  only  use  glycogen  as  an  energy  source  during\nanaerobiosis, without the accumulation or release of phosphate [20].  The  GAOs\nmicrobial community is mainly composed of Candidatus Competibacter phosphatis,\nbelonging to the phylum Gammaprotebacteria, Defluviicoccus vanus-related organism\ncluster 1, Defluviicoccus vanus-related organism cluster 2 and other bacteria\nbelonging to the Alphaproteobacteria [20].\n\nHowever, the amount of PHA accumulated under aerobic/anaerobic process\nis generally less than 20%, although higher values (between 30% and 57%) were\nalready achieved [20]. Due to this, the anaerobic dynamic feeding is a more efficient\nstrategy for the production of PHA using mixed cultures.\n\nThe  production  of  PHA  by  mixed  cultures  offer  some  benefits  over  their\nproduction  by  pure  cultures.  The  main  one  is  that,  since  the  selection  of\nmicroorganism occurs on the basis of their capability to store PHA, there is no\nneed to work under sterilized conditions [14].  Furthermore,  their  PHB  specific\nproductivity is 10 times higher than the ones of pure cultures [7].\n\nThese types of cultures also allow to use the organic carbon from wastes and\nindustrial influents [19].  It  was  already  demonstrated  than  mixed  cultures  are\ncapable of using single VFAs or simple mixtures of them as organic carbon source\n[22, 23] , but also of using more complex substrates such as olive oil [24, 25] and palm oil\n[26], paper mill effluents [27] sugarcane molasses [28] and other waste effluents such as\nfood  and  fruit  and  municipal  wastewaters [19]. However, mixed cultures are not\ncapable of store PHA from sugar-based compounds when submitted to feast and\nfamine conditions. Thus, these more complex substrates have to be submitted to\nprevious fermentation process, to transform carbohydrates into volatile fatty acids\n(VFAs) and other carboxylic acids, in a process called acidogenesis. These organic\nacids can be then used by mixed cultures for the production of PHA [20].  Another\nproblem is that, so far, it was not possible to achieve high cellular concentrations\nassociated with high contents in PHA [20].\n\n2.3.2 Pure cultures\n\nPure  cultures  are  commonly  used  for  the  industrial  production  of  PHA.\nAlthough sterilized conditions are required for pure cultures, they allow the use of\n\n\n\n10\n\nmetabolic engineered strains in order to improve productivity, as well as the use\nof different substrates or to molecularly design the final product [6].\n\nThe species Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida [29], Aeromonas\nhydrophila [30], Thermus thermophilus [31],  Methylobacterium organophilum [32],\nAlcaligenes latus [33], Cupriavidus necator,  as  well  as  several  recombinant  strains  of\nEscherichia coli [34], among others, have already been used for the successful\nproduction of PHA.\n\nCupriavidus necator,  also  known  in  the  past  as Hydrogenomonas eutrophus,\nAlcaligenes eutropha, Ralstonia eutrophus and Wautersia eutrophus [35],  is  one\nextensively studied and used microorganism, due to its capability of producing\nPHA [36]. This Gram-negative bacteria [37] is a strictly aerobe, facultative\nchemoautotrophic [36, 38].  It  is  capable  of  using  hydrogen  as  a  metabolic  energy\nsource [39] and can easily grow and accumulate a large amount of PHA (up to 87 %\nas dry cell mass [40]) in a simple defined medium [38].\n\nThis microorganism was used for the industrial production of PHB by the\nImperial Chemical Industries (United Kingdom) [38] and  for  the  production  of  a\npoly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) by Metabolix (USA) using\npropionic acid and glucose as substrates.\n\nCupriavidus necator and  other  pure  cultures,  unlike  mixed  cultures,  are\ncapable  of  using  complex  substrates  such  as  sugar  molasses  and  other  sources  of\ncarbohydrates for the production and accumulation of PHA and not only organic\nacids. This way, these cultures do not require the acidogenesis step. Nevertheless\nit is important to refer that the wild type strain of Cupriavidus necator (H16) is not\ncapable of metabolizing glucose, since it does not have the enzymes responsible\nfor glucose transport and its phosphorylation [37]. However, there are natural\noccurring mutants capable of metabolize it [41] using the Entner-Doudoroff\npathway [42], and some strains are commercially available [43]. Notwithstanding, the\nglucose uptake mechanism by this organism is still not fully understood [35].\n\nNevertheless, the well known genome and metabolism of Cupriavidus necator\nmake it an ideal microorganism for the production of specific PHA, both through\nnatural or recombinant strains [44-46].  The  genes  of Cupriavidus necator are  also\ncommonly used to recombine in other species. In these are included bacteria such\nas Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lacti, yeasts like Saccharomyces cerevisiae, plants like\nthe Arabidopsis thaliana or tobacco plants, or even in insect cell lines like Spodoptera\nfrugiperda [47].\n\n\n\n11\n\nThe  great  advantage  of  using  pure  culture,  towards  mixed  cultures,  is  the\npossibility of easily achieve cellular concentrations higher than 80 g/L, with a PHA\ncontent  that  can  be  more  than  80  %  of  the  cell  dry  weight [20].    This  allows  a\nsimpler and less expensive downstream  process, which may cost of working\nunder the required sterilized conditions [6].\n\n2.3.3 PHA production metabolism\n\nStorage of PHA occurs when the microbial cells uptake the carbon substrate\nat  a  higher  rate  than  the  one  they  can  grow.  This  can  be  due  to  an  external\nlimitation, such as the lack of nitrogen, phosphorus or oxygen, or by an internal\nlimitation regarding the levels or activity of anabolic enzymes [7].\n\nThere are some known metabolic pathways leading to the synthesis of PHA.\nNevertheless, all of them have in common the production of (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-\nCoAs using several metabolites and precursors. PHA is then synthesized using\nthese produced (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs [37]. The different possible metabolic\npathways that lead to the synthesis of PHA can be observed in  Figure 2.\n\nMost of the PHA-producing bacteria used, like the species Cupriavidus\nnecator  and Alcaligenes  latus, are capable of using the Entner-Doudoroff pathway,\nfor the production of acetyl-Coa. This metabolic pathway is responsible for the\ncatabolic degradation of carbohydrates,  resulting in the formation of pyruvate,\nwhich can be converted into acetyl-CoA. Under conditions favorable to growth,\nthe  acetyl-CoA   enters  the  tricarboxylic   acid   (TCA)   cycle   where  it  is   oxidized\ninto   CO2,  in  order  to  generate   anabolic  precursors,  additional  energy,  and\nreducing equivalents. These reducing equivalents are consumed during oxidative\nphosphorilation, using oxygen as a final electron acceptor, resulting in the\nproduction of ATP. On the other hand, under growth-limiting conditions the\nacetyl-CoA is not oxidized to CO2.  The  lack  of  an  external  nitrogen  source,  for\nexample, will cease the production of proteins, causing the accumulation of\nNADH and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) in\nthe  cell.  This  results  in  the  inhibition  of  the  TCA  cycle  enzymes  and  in  the\nconversion of the acetyl-CoA to PHB [7].\n\nAcetyl-CoA  is  converted  to  PHB  in  a  sequence  of  reactions  catalyzed  by\nenzymes. First, two units of acetyl-CoA are condensed by the -ketothiolase into\nacetoacetyl-CoA, which is then reduced by the acetoacetyl-CoA reductase to (R)-3-\n\n\n\n12\n\nhydroxybutyryl-CoA, that is incorporated into the PHB chain  as\n3-hydroxybutyrate by PHA synthase [42].  There  are  many  variants  of  PHA\nsynthases and they are classified depending on the substrate specificities [7]. For\nexample, Cupriavidus necator wild type possesses a class I PHA synthase that\naccepts short chain-hydroxyacyl-CoAs for polymerization [8]. Nevertheless, since\nthe enzymes involved are stereospecific, all microbially synthesizes hydroxylacyl\nmonomers are in the (R) configuration [7].\n\nFigure 2 - Methabolic pathways for the synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates [20].\n\nShort-chain  organic  acids,  also  known  as  volatile  fatty  acids  (VFAs),  can  be\nused  for  the  production  of  PHA  too,  as  they  can  be  activated  to  their\ncorresponding acyl-CoA molecule. It is assumed that the metabolic pathways\nleading  to  the  synthesis  of  PHA  in  mixed  microbial  cultures  must  be  similar  to\nthose described for pure cultures using the same substrates [48, 49]. For example,\nwhen acetate is used as a carbon source it is converted in to acety-CoA and can be\nused both for growth or PHB production as described above. Propionate is\ntransformed into propionyl-CoA that can be consumed as such to form a\nhydroxyacyl unit for the synthesis of PHA or decarboxylated first to acetyl-CoA. A\nunit of proionyl-CoAs can be combined with another one to form 3-hydroxy-2-\nmethylvalerate (3H2MV) or, instead, with one of acetyl-CoA to form either 3-\n\n\n\n13\n\nhydroxyvalerate (HV) or 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutyrate (3H2MB).  Butyrate and\nvalerate  can  be  converted  directly  to  3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA  and  3-\nhydroxyvaleryl-CoA, thus they do not require a condensation step like it is the\ncase of acetate and propionate, as this will form form 3-hydroxybutyrate (HB) and\nHV,  respectively.  The  monomers  HB,  HV,  3H2MV  and  3H2MB  are  the  most\nfrequent PHA monomers synthesized by pure cultures [7].\n\nHB, HV and medium- and long- chain lenght fatty acids can be broken down\nto smaller ones by the -oxidation pathway to form PHA monomers. Other\nmetabolic  pathways,  like  the  novo  fatty  acid  synthesis  also  can  produce\nintermediates for PHA production and alkanoates, resulting from the oxidtion of\nthe corresponding alkanes, can be also converted to their corresponding acyl-CoA\n[7].\n\n2.3.3.1 Use of molecular hydrogen in the metabolism\n\nMolecular hydrogen (H2) can be either oxidized or produced biologically, in\na reaction catalyzed by hydrogenases. The most common hydrogenases are the\n[NiFe] and the [FeFe] enzymes, which are both capable of catalyze the reversible\noxidation of molecular hydrogen (H2  2H+ + 2e-) [50]. However, while the [NiFe]\nhydrogenases are O2-tolerant, the [FeFe] hydrogenases are permanently\ninactivated  by  molecular  oxygen,  as  it  reacts  irreversible  with  their  active  site,\ndestroying it [50].\n\nThe [NiFe] hydrogenases are the ones present in Cupriavidus necator [51], due\nto  is  strictly  aerobic  nature.  They  present  a  high  affinity  to  H2, thus allowing this\nmicrorganism  oxidize  it  even  when  it  is  present  only  in  trace  amounts [52]. The\nstrain Cupriavidus necator H16 exhibits a soluble a hydrogen:NAD+ oxido-reductase\n[53],  which  can  use  H2 to  regenerate  NAD+ to  NADH,  and  a  membrane-bound\nhydrogenase linked to the respiratory chain [53] that  oxides  NADH  back  to  NAD+\n[54].  This  reaction  originates  potential  energy  in  the  form  of  a  pH  gradient  and\nelectrochemical potential across the membrane, which is used by the membrane\nenzyme ATP synthase to regenerate ADP to ATP [54].  Thus the oxidation of H2 is\ncoupled  to  the  reduction  of  O2 [52], by the oxidative phosphorylation pathway [54],\nand is used as a metabolic energy source for this bacterium [52]. This allows\nCupriavidus necator to grow autotrophically, on minimal salts medium, using\ncarbon dioxide as a carbon source [53].\n\n\n\n14\n\nThe autotrophic production of PHA by Cupriavidus necator has already\nbeen  achieved,  with  a  yield  of  5.6  g  biomass/  mol  H2,  a  maximum  cellular\nconcentration  of   20  g/L  and  a  PHA  content  of   85  % [55].  However,  no  studies\nhave been found on the impact of molecular hydrogen on the cellular growth and\nPHA production by Cupriavidus necator in heterotrophic conditions. The energy\nsource  may  enhance  growth  and  PHA  production,  especially  in  low  energy\nsubstrates such as acetate [38]. On the other hand, high intracellular concentrations\nof NADH may completely divert the carbon flux from the citric acid cycle to the\nPHA  synthesis  pathway.  This  may  happen  since  the  citrate  synthase,  the  first\nenzyme from the citric acid cycle, is highly inhibited by NADH, not being capable\nof accept acetycl-CoA for the cycle [56].  However,  the  extra  NADH  may  also  be\nused in the synthesis of proteins which could promote growth [57]. It is not clear if\nCupriavidus  necator  is  capable  of  use  NADH  to  reduce  NADP+ to  NADPH,  in  a\nreaction catalyzed by transhydrogenase enzymes. This molecule has a less\npronounced inhibitory effect on the citrate synthase, while still promotes the\nproduction of PHA [56].\n\n2.4 Industrial waste streams as carbon substrates\n\nThe production of PHA usually occurs under aerobic conditions, which\nresults in high losses of the carbon substrate as CO2 due to cellular respiration. As\na result, less than 50% of the carbon source is directed to biomass growth of PHA\nproduction. This causes the production costs to be highly determined by the cost\nof raw materials, which can represent up to 50% of the entire production costs.\nThe use of purified or synthetic substrates significantly increases the production\nprice [37]. Then finding suitable low-cost substrates is a priority for the\neconomically viable production of PHA. The utilization of waste materials for the\nproduction of biopolymers is a cost-efficient strategy that could also help to solve\nthe disposable problems of several fields of industrial activity [6, 37].\n\nIn  Europe,  the  dairy  industry  provides  huge  amounts  of  surplus  whey  that\ncan be used as a source of lactose for the production of poly(lactic acid), PHA and\nbioethanol. Glycerol, a side-product of the biodiesel production, can be used as a\nsubstrate for the production of PHA and lactic acid. Meat and bone meal from the\nslaughtering and rendering industries as well as several grass and silage residues\n\n\n\n15\n\nshowed excellent results for the cultivation of microbes capable of producing PHA\n[6].\n\nIn other areas of the world, molasses from the sugar industry, starch, waste\nlipid and alcohols such as methanol and especially lingo-cellulosic feedstocks may\nbe available in quantities suitable to be used in industrial processes [6]. For\nexample, in Malaysia, palm oil is a potential feedstock for PHA production, since\nit is produced in very large scales there. The yield from vegetable oils is at least\ntwo times the one from sugars [9].\n\nAlthough all these prospects regarding cheap inexpensive carbon sources,\ntheir use usually result in lower growth rates due to the inefficient use of certain\nnutrients [37].\n\n2.4.1 Volatile Fatty Acids\n\nVolatile  fatty  acids  are  the  only  organic  carbon  source  that  can  be  directly\nused both by mixed and pure cultures for the production of PHA. As already seen,\nthey  are  a  central  part  in  the  PHA  synthesis  pathway  and  by  feeding  of  different\norganic acids to these cultures may result in PHA with different properties.\n\nThe complex biomass in wastewater can be pre-fermented in order to convert\nsugars into volatile fatty acids (VFAs), in an anaerobic process called acidogenesis\n[14, 37]. This way is possible to form organic acids such as acetic, propionic, butyric\nand valeric acids, with a high yield [14].\n\nIt is important to know how to control the final product of this pre-\nfermentation, since the VFAs are directly converted by microorganism into their\nrespective acyl-CoA, which are then used in the synthesis of the PHA chain [19]. So,\nthe composition of the used organic carbon source fed stream determines the final\nPHA structure [14].\n\nHowever, at high concentrations, these acids can be inhibitory or toxic [37, 58].\nThis toxicity is attributed to their undissociated lipophilic molecules, which can\neasily cross the cell membranes, dissociate and acidify the cytoplasm. As a result,\nthe gradient of protons across the membrane is disrupted and the energy\nproduction and transport systems associated with this gradient are no longer\nmaintained [37, 58].  In  response  to  the  accumulation  of  fatty  acids,  free  energy  is\nreleased via ATPase and protons are expelled out of cells in order to maintain the\nproton gradient. This means, that lower growth rate, acid utilization rate and yield\nof PHA are usually achieved [11, 37, 58].\n\n\n\n16\n\n The  yield  and  rates  are  strongly  influenced  by  the  pH  of  the  mixed  liquor,\nsince at low pHs the short chain fatty acids are predominantly in the undissociated\nform [37].  It  is  the  pKa  value  of  the  organic  acid  and  not  its  size  that  influences  its\ninhibitory effect [37, 58]. Since the values for these VFAs are similar (lactic acid pKa =\n3.86, acetic acid pKa = 4.76, butyric acid pKa = 4.83 and propionic acid pKa = 4.87),\nso is the inhibitory effect of all of them  at a pH value below 5.0 [37].\n\nAt  pH  level  close  to  the  optimal  pH  for Cupriavidus necator (pH  7.0)  and  for\nmixed cultures, these organic acids are mainly in the dissociated form. Yet they are\nnot transported so easily across the cell membrane [11, 38],  the  latter  can  cause  an\nundesirable increase in osmotic pressure, due to the accumulation of anions [11, 58].\nOn  the  other  hand,  at  low  initial  VFA  levels,  substrate  limitation  can  occur.  The\nconcentration of short chain fatty acids and pH has to be thus carefully regulated,\nin order for the undissociated fatty acids to enter the cytoplasm, being activated\nand metabolized into CO2, cell biomass and/or PHB [37]. For example, it was shown\nthat propionic acid is used more efficiently by Cupriavidus necator at a pH of 7.5 [59]\n\nand that 5 g.L-1 produce less PHA than 2-3 .L-1 of PHA at pH 7.5 [60].\nLactate  is  the  organic  acid  preferred  acid  by Cupriavidus necator for growth,\n\nfollowed by acetate, succinate and propionate. Butyrate is only consumed during\nthe  growth  phase  if  other  organic  acids  are  not  present [37], but it is rapidly\nconsumed during stationary phase or in the absence of growth by inhibition [37, 61].\n\nMetabolic simulations showed that acetate is an inefficient source for the\nproduction of energy. The ATP required for the uptake of acetate is almost as\nmuch as the one synthesized from its metabolism, being the maintenance ATP low\nfor growth. Because of this, growth in acetate is slower than with butyrate or\nlactate [38]. The utilization of propionate and butyrate are energetically favored, but\nadditional ATP is needed to transport this acid. Lactate is the preferred, since less\nenergy is needed to transport it to the central metabolic pathways [37, 38].\n\nTable 2 - Organic carbon flow and metabolic regulation in Cupriavidus necator grown on various\nsubstrates [34]\n\nAcetate Butyrate Lactate\nC in CO2/C in substrate 0.38 0.34 0.56\nC in biomass/C in substrate 0.15 0.04 0.07\nC in PHB/C in substrate 0.47 0.62 0.37\nMol ATP/mol substrate 0.95 5.97 5.75\n\n\n\n17\n\nThe maximum PHB yields achieved with these simulations were of 0.33, 0.33\nand 0.67 mol/mol substrate for acetate, lactate and butyrate, respectively [38].\n\nOn  the  other  hand,  the  highest  PHA  production  yields  are  achieved  with\nbutyric  acid.  Butyrate  is  a  more  energetically  efficient  carbon  source,  for  PHA\nproduction that the other organic acids.\n\n2.5 Reactor Operation\n\nReactor operation conditions for pure cultures are very different from those\nof  mixed  microbial  cultures.  While  pure  controls  require  the  use  of  sterile\nconditions, which greatly increases the production cost, the reactor operation is\nrelatively  simple  and  easier  to  optimize.   On  the  other  hand,   mixed  microbial\ncultures do not require sterile conditions, but they require the imposition of\nselective pressure in order to select for PHA-producing bacteria. Common reactor\noperation  parameters  are  described  below  for  each  case,  with  emphasis  on  the\nmicrobial mixed cultures.\n\n2.5.1 Pure cultures\n\nThe  production  of  PHA  by Cupriavidus necator mainly occurs during\nstationary phase and so, their production is usually carried out in two steps. First\nthe  cells  are  fed  with  enough  carbon  and  nitrogen  in  order  to  maximize  growth,\ntill a high cellular concentration is achieved [35, 37]. After this, a key nutrient, such as\nnitrogen, magnesium, molecular oxygen or phosphorus, is limited to trigger PHA\nsynthesis  and  inhibit  growth.  This  is  usually  carried  out  with  the  suppression  of\nnitrogen [57].\n\nThe  energy  formation  and  anabolic  reactions  within  the  cell  are  promoted\nwhen  the  Carbon/Nitrogen  (C/N)  ratio  is  less  than  20,  while  a  C/N  ratio  between\n20 and 200 inhibits cellular growth, but increases the yield and production rate of\nPHB [62]. This was due to the suppression of the -oxidative and\npoly(hydroxyalkanoic) pathways, caused by the lack of nitrogen source [62].\n\nIt  was  also  verified  that  a  residual  level  of  phosphorus  (0.35  g.L-1) and\nmagnesium (10 mg.L-1) may enhance PHA production [37]. Since PHB is composed\nonly  of  carbon,  hydrogen  and  oxygen,  the  feed  of  carbon  source  is  of  primal\nsignificance [38]. The complete exhaustion of phosphorus and magnesium may also\n\n\n\n18\n\nhave  a  negative  impact  in  the  polymer  molecular  weight  and  increase  the\npolydispersity index and should be maintained at residual levels to enhance PHB\nproduction [63].\n\n2.5.2 Mixed Cultures\n\nStudies on production of PHA by mixed microbial cultures are carried out in\ntwo separated reactors. The first one, where the microbial population is selected\nand the second, where PHB is accumulated. This is needed, since anaerobic\ndynamic feeding conditions are necessary for the selection of PHA-producing\nbacteria.  As  a  result,  the  loading  rates  are  limited  and  are  not  high  enough  to\nachieve a satisfactory PHB content in the growth reactor [7].\n\nThe performance of the PHA accumulation stage is highly influenced by the\neffectiveness of these selective pressure conditions and so the optimization of the\nselection reactor is of highly importance. Therefore, these conditions must result in\nthe enrichment of the microbial population in bacteria capable of a high and stable\nPHA storage capacity, as microorganism presenting low storage capacities would\nhave  a   negative  impact  on  the  production  and  downstream  of  PHB.  As  a  result,\nthis two stages are usually carried in different reactors, so different optimal\nconditions can be applied in each one [7].\n\nAn  ideal  selection  reactor  would  allow  high  organic  loading  rates  and  short\nretention time. Hence, a high growth capacity associated with a high capability to\nstore PHA is desirable. This would allow the operation of the accumulation\nreactor with higher cellular concentration, so higher volumetric production rates\nwere achievable [7].\n\nThe selection reactor is usually operated as a SBR Since they operate per\ncycles  comprising  distinct  periods.  Usually,  the  cycle  starts  with  the  feed  of  the\nreactor, followed by the reaction phase that includes both feast and famine,\nsettling  phase  and  discharge  of  the  supernatant.  This  allows  the  imposition  of  a\nwide range of parameters [64]. Several factor that regulate the use of the carbon\nsource  during  feast  phase  either  for  growth  or  for  the  storage  of  PHA  have  been\nstudied under different conditions, namely solids retention time (SRT), hydraulic\nretention time (HRT), pH, temperature, cycle length, feast to famine length ratio\n(F/F ratio), volumetric loading rate (VLR), influent carbon source and nutrients\nconcentration and the associated limitation/inhibition kinetics [7].\n\n\n\n19\n\nIt  was  demonstrated  that  for  SRTs  higher  than  2  days,  the  yield  of  PHB\nproduction under excess nutrients was constant and independent form the specific\ngrowth  rate.  However,  at  a  SRT   lower  than  2  days,  this  yield  significantly\ndecreases with a decreasing SRT [48].\n\nTable 3 - Usual operational parameters applied on the growh reactor [14]\n\nThe F/F ratio is one of the main parameters regulating if the carbon source is\nused for growth or for PHA storage. At high PHA storage capacity was observed\nfor low F/F ratios (up to 0.26), while  high F/F ratios (higher than 0.90) promoted a\ngrowth response in a culture fed with synthetic organic acids and a SRT of 1 day.\nA  similar  observation  was  made  in  a  culture  using  fermented  molasses  as\nfeedstock and a SRT of 10 days [7]. This is possible to verify in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3 - PHA and active biomass yields on substrate, regarding the feast/famine ratio. SBR operated\nat a SRT of 1 day (a); and at a SRT of 10 days (b) [7].\n\nThe reason behind this growth/PHA storage regulation is related with the\ndecrease of the amount of intracellular components required for cell growth, such\nas RNA and enzymes, during famine phase. Therefore, when the carbon source is\n\n\n\n20\n\navailable again cellular growth is internally limited, while the accumulation of\nPHA  is  energetically  less  demanding.  This  way,  the  cell  can  rapidly  consume  the\nexternal carbon source and store it, while the growth metabolism is not reactivated\n[7].  As  a  result,  after  long  periods  of  starvation  around  70%  (Cmol/Cmol)  of  the\ncarbon source can be used towards storage, rather than growth and maintenance\n[48, 49].\n\nThe manipulation of the influent substrate concentration and/or the loading\nrates can be used not only to regulate the F/F ratio, but also to control the substrate\nuptake  rate.  This  should  increase  with  increasing  loading  rates,  till  a  maximum\nvalue, after which substrate inhibition is verified. Since PHA-producing\nmicroorganism use the substrate uptake rate as a competitive advantage towards\nothers, so it does not limit the uptake rate. As a result, if the substrate\nconcentration is kept above a kinetically limiting value and below the substrate\ninhibition point, this may result in an increased selection efficiency [7].\n\nThe  selection  of  cultures  with  a  high  capacity  to  store  PHA  was  already\nachieved both under nutrient excess and nutrient limiting conditions, as PHA\nstorage occurs due to an internal limitation rather than to an nutrient limitation.\nNevertheless, the amount of nutrients available can be used to control the amount\nof  carbon  source  used  for  growth,  not  only  during  feast,  but  also  during  famine.\nUnder excess of nutrients, microorganisms can use the polymer stored during\nfeast in order to grow during famine, giving them an extra competitive advantage\nas  a  stable  growth  rate  is  possible  to  maintain.  Furthermore,  cultures  adapted  in\nthe  presence  of  nutrients  excess  are  more  insensible  to  them  in  the  accumulation\nreactor, which may be fundamental if complex feedstocks are used [26].\n\n2.5.2.1 Oxygen\n\nA determinant factor in the achievement of high cell densities and growth\nrates are  the aeration rate and gas stream composition [65]. It seems to be important\nto  maintain  oxygen  saturation  in  the  mixed  liquor  of  at  least  2.0  mg/L.  However,\nduring the exponential Phase, the oxygen requirements can be higher than this\nand  the  use  pure  oxygen  could  be  required.  This  is  an  expensive  process  at  large\nscale, that should be compensated with a high volumetric productivity [65].\n\nThe  dissolved  oxygen  (DO)  is  a  good  way  to  easily  identify  the\nbeginning/end of the feast and famine phases. The beginning of the feast phase is\nassociated with a decrease in the dissolved oxygen concentration. This happens\n\n\n\n21\n\nright after the substrate addition, being and indicator that the microbial\npopulation is metabolizing the substrate. The concentration of dissolved oxygen\nremains more or less the same during the feast period, increasing again in the end\nof it/beginning of famine [14].\n\n2.6 Harvesting and PHA purification\n\nPHA  are  accumulated  in  the  bacterial  cell  cytoplasm  in  the  form  of\ngranules.  This  granules  have  an  average  size  of  0.2  \u2013  0.5  \u00b5m.  This  makes  the\nrecovery  of  PHA  a  challenging  process,  with  the  harvesting  of  cells  and  PHB\nextraction significantly affect the price of the final product [9], which can represent\nmore than 26% [58].\n\nA  diagram  of  the  whole  PHA  production  process  is  possible  to  observe  in\nFigure 4. First, the cells should be harvested. Usually this is carried out by biomass\nprecipitation, that can promoted by the of 1% Na2HPO4, 1% CaCl, and 100 ppm of\npolyacrylamide to the medium [9].  After  that  biomass  is  pressed  filter  in  order  to\nremove water and the cakes are then freeze-dried and ground into powder [6, 9].\n\nFigure 4 - General PHA production and extraction process [6]\n\nTo  extract  PHA  is  then  necessary  to  rupture  the  bacterial  cell  in  order  to\nrelease  the  granules.  There  are  several  ways  to  rupture  the  cells  and  afterwards\n\n\n\n22\n\nrecover  the  PHA.  To  disrupt  cells,  several  digestion  methods  can  be  applied,  as\nwell as mechanical disruption. The recovery of PHA can also be carried out using\nsolvent extraction or two-phase systems [9].\n\nThe required PHA purity is determined by the final application it is intended\nto  be  used.  For  example  for  mulching  film  or  garbage  bags,  a  lower  degree  of\npurity  may  be  used.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  PHA  is  produced  to  be  used  in\nmedical applications, that the final product has to be free of any contaminating\nchemicals, solvents or endotoxins [9].\n\nRegardless the final application of PHA, it must be assured that a sufficiently\nhigh  molecular  weight,  so  it  can  be  further  processed.  This  may  be  problematic\nsince,  to  achieve  high  purities  of  the  polymer,  aggressive  extraction  methods  are\nusually required, which cause polymer degradation. Thus a compromise between\npurity,  efficiency  of  recover  and  the  molecular  weight  of  the  polymer  must  be\nachieved. Furthermore this has to be done in a environmental friendly way, with\nan associated economical feasibility [9]. Some proposed methods are reviewed in\nhere.\n\n2.6.1 Digestion methods\n\n Digestion methods involve the solubilization of the non-PHA cellular mass.\nThis digestion can be classified into either enzymatic or chemical [6].\n\nVarious  types  of  enzymes  can  be  used  for  the  enzymatic  digestion  of  the\nPHA-producing biomass. The enzymes used can be proteases such as trypsin,\nchymotrypsin, papain and bromelain, but also -glycosidases like cellulase and\nlysozyme [66]. These enzymes are capable of cleaving linkages in the bacteria cell\nwall [67],  which  results  in  the  lyses  of  the  cell [68]. Since enzymes are very specific\nwith  respect  to  the  reactions  that  catalyze  and  since  they  can  operate  in  mild\nconditions, it is possible to recover PHA with good quality and without molecular\nweight degradation.\n\nChemical digestion is usually carried out using sodium hypochlorite or\nsurfactants. Sodium hypochlorite is a strong, non-selective oxidizer that can be\nused to disrupt the cells [69]. Among the surfactants, SDS presents a good\nperformance  in  destabilizing  the  cell  wall  and  membranes,  but  other  can  be  used\n[9]. The problem with this method is while the digestion by hypochlorite can cause\nsevere degradation of the molecular weight of the PHA chains (up to 50%), the\n\n\n\n23\n\nsurfactants alone have lower recovery efficiencies [70] and  lower  degrees  of  purity\nare achieved [71].\n\n Nevertheless most of the studies have been directed to the use of chemicals.\nThis happens because of the easy access to various suitable chemicals and to the\nhigh cost of enzymes and to the complexity of their recovery from the medium [9].\n\n2.6.2 Mechanical disruption\n\nThe mechanical disruption of cell does not involve the use of chemicals, so it\nminimizes the contamination to the product as well as the environmental\npollution. The two main methods used, for large scale cellular disruption in\npharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are the bead-milling and the high\npressure homogenization [72].\n\nBead  mills  cause  cellular  disruption  due  to  the  shearing  action  and  energy\ntransfer from beads to cells in the contact zones. This method is ideal for the\nextraction of PHA, since it does not require much power supply, is not susceptible\nto blockages and does not degrade the PHA granules [72]. However, it requires an\nextensive optimization in order to establish an efficient disruption system [9].\n\nIn the high pressures homogenization, cells are obliged to pass through a\nrestricted orifice discharged valve under high pressure. Some possible\ndrawbacks of these method are the possible micronization of PHA, a process that\nreduces the PHA particles to a micrometric or nanometric scale, and the formation\nof fine cellular debris that can interfere with the further downstream process [73].\n\nNevertheless, both technologies have already been successfully tested for the\nrecovery of PHA from biomass [72]. Generally the drawbacks of these methods are\nthe high capital investment required, the long processing time and the difficulty to\nscale them up [9].\n\n2.6.3 Solvent extraction\n\nSolvent extraction is the most extensively adopted method to recover PHA,\nespecially at laboratory scale, due to its simplicity and rapidness. The solvents\nused are commonly chlorinated hydrocarbons such as chloroform, 1,2-\ndichloroethane [74]\n\n\n\n24\n\n First  the  cell  membrane  permeability  has  to  be  modified  in  order  for  the\nsolvent to access the intracellular PHA [75]. After being dissolved by the solvent,\nPHA are separated from the remaining biomass by filtration or centrifugation.\nThey are then precipitated, usually by addition of a non-solvent such as methanol\nor ethanol to the solution [74]. This method of extraction is highly efficient, causes\nnegligible polymer degradation and allows for the removal of bacterial\nendotoxins.\n\n However, chlorinated hydrocarbons are highly pollutant and expensive to\nbe used on high scale. The use of some cyclic carbonates like ethylene carbonate [9]\n\nand 1,2-propylene carbonate [76, 77] may overcome this problem.\nA problem inherent to all solvent extraction is that they disrupt the\n\namorphous nascent state of the PHA granules [9, 69, 78],  which  may  be  useful  for\nsome applications. The solubilization of the granules and further precipitation\nmakes PHA to re-crystallize in a more crystalline state [46, 69], becoming more brittle\nand harder to process [79].\n\n\n\n25\n\n3 Materials and Methods\n\n3.1 Microorganisms\n\nActivated sludge from two different wastewater treatment plants were used\nas inocula for the bioreactors. The wastewater treatment plants were both from\nfood/feed processing companies and were operated as SBRs.\n\nThe  activated  sludge  used  in  Hydrocell  (Chapter  4)  came  from  Solae,  a\nprotein processing factory in Ieper, Belgium. On the other hand, the activated\nsludge  for  the  Production  of  PHB  by  ADF  (Chapter  5)  and  for  the  Production  of\nFish Feed (Chapter 6) came from Van Steenberge, a brewery in Ertvelde, Belgium.\n\n3.2 Reactor operation\n\nThree different process for the production of PHB were tested: Hydrocell\n(Chapter 4); Production of PHB by ADF (Chapter 5); and Production of Fish Feed\n(Chapter 6).\n\nThe processes described in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 share some\ncharacteristics and basically comprise two main steps. The first one, the growth\nreactor, is used for the selection and growth of PHB producing bacteria. While on\nthe second one, the accumulation reactor, the biomass selected in the growth\nreactor  is  fed  with  enough  carbon  source  in  order  to  accumulate  a  significant\namount  of  PHB.  In  the  process  described  in  Chapter  6,  the  biomass  was  not\npreviously  acclimated  in  a  growth  reactor,  but  was  instead  used  directly  in  an\naccumulation reactor.\n\nThe procedures are explained in further detail in each one of their\ncorresponding chapters. Nevertheless, some general methodologies  are explained\nbelow.\n\n3.2.1 Hydrocell (Chapter 4)\n\nA 3 reactors system was assembled for the Hydrocell process, consisting of a\nelectrolysis, a growth and an accumulation reactor. The electrolysis reactor, as the\nname  implies,  was  used  for  the  electrolysis  of  water  and  the  consequent\n\n\n\n26\n\nproduction of H2 and O2. The selection and growth of the PHB producing bacteria\nfrom activated sludge was carried out on the growth reactor. The headspace of the\nelectrolysis reactor was connected to this reactor thus allowing the continuous\nsupply of H2 and O2 to the growth medium via fine bubbling.  Putting things into\nperspective, these two reactor worked together for the selection of PHB producing\nbacteria, the first step of a two steps process, as described in Chapter 3.2.\n\nThe accumulation reactor comprises the second of those steps. In this step,\npart of the biomass from the grow reactor is transferred to another reactor where\nconditions that promote the production of PHB are applied. However, due to the\nlack  of  means,  this  was  not  done  in  a  regular  defined  basis.  In  the  cases  an\naccumulation stage was not carried out, the excess sludge was discarded.\n\nThe  diagram  of  the  process  is  described  in  Figure  5.  The  methods  for  each\nreactor  are  described  further  below.  Analyses  were  made  as  described  in  chapter\n3.3 and the formulas used are described in Appendix B.\n\n3.2.1.1 Electrolysis reactor\n\n An electrolysis system was assembled in a closed reactor for the production\nof hydrogen (and oxygen) gas. This consisted of two electrodes: one in titanium\nand the other one in titanium, coated with Iridium oxide. In order to avoid contact\n\nAC-DCV A\n\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-O2\n\nO2\n\nO2\n\nO2\n\nO2\n\nO2\n\nO2\n\nH2\n\nH 2\n\nH2\n\nH 2\nH2\n\nH2 H 2 H2\n\nO2H2\n\nH2\n\nO2\nH2\n\nH2\n\nO2\n\nH2\n\nH2\n\nPower Source\nElectrolysis\n\nElectrolysis Tank Growth Reactor Accumulation\nReactor\n\nAir\nPump\n\nBatch\nInfluent\n\nGrowth Reactor\nInfluent\n\nFigure 5 - Diagram of the Hydrocell process with the electrolysis, growth and accumulation\nreactors\n\n\n\n27\n\nbetween  the  electrodes,  they  were  fixed  to  plastic  carriers,  at  a  distance  of  15  cm.\nThe area of the electrodes was of 79 cm2.\n\nThe electrodes were connected to an alternating current - direct current (AC-\nDC) power supply. The positive pole of the power supply was connected to the\niridium oxide coated titanium electrode (the electrolysis' anode) and the negative\npole was connected to the other titanium electrode (the electrolysis' cathode).\n\nThe electrodes were then covered, by adding 4.0 L of tap water containing 1\ng/L Na2SO4.  The  salt  was  added  in  order  to  improve  the  conductivity  of  the\nsystem. This medium was kept under constant stirring. A electric current of 20.2 V\n(\u00b1  0.2)  with  a  intensity  of   0.6  A  was  applied  so   the  electrolysis  of  water  was\nachieved.\n\nThe headspace of this reactor was coupled to the growth reactor in order to\nprovide H2 and O2 to the growth medium, via fine bubbling.\n\n3.2.1.2 Growth reactor\n\nThe reactor was incubated with 4 L of activated sludge from a protein factory\nwaste water treatment plant, as described in Chapter 3.1.\n\nThe reactor was operated in the 3 cycles of 8 hours per day. At the beginning\nof  each  cycle,  150  mL  of  fresh  influent  were  added  during  the  1st  minute.  The\nduration of the feast phase was controlled at 2.5 h, while the famine phase lasted\nfor  5.5  h.  The  compositions  of  the  influents  used  are  described  on  Appendix  A\nHydrogen  and  oxygen  gases  form  the  electrolysis  were  fed  continuously  during\nboth phases. Aeration was also applied continuously by means of a aeration stone\nand  stirring  was  kept  at  300  rpm.  pH  in  the  reactor  was  kept  below  7.8  (\u00b1  2%),\nwith diluted sulfuric acid 1 M.\n\nHydraulic retention time (Equation 10, Appendix B)  was not maintained\nconstant over the experiment. It started at 18.1 days, but it was gradually reduced\ntill 8.1 days on on day 5.  On day 10 it was verified that the pump responsible for\nfeeding the reactor with fresh influent was not capable of maintaining the\ncalibrated flowrate. As a result, the HRT on this day was of 28 days. After this, the\nHRT was adjusted to a average value of 14.4 days (\u00b13.4) from day 11 till day 21.\nFor the last ten days, from day 22 till day 32, the HRT was adjusted to an average\nof 11.2 days (\u00b1 0.8). All this gave a global a average retention time of 12.9 (\u00b1 3.1)\ndays.\n\n\n\n28\n\nSolid  retention  time  (Equation  11,  Appendix  B)  was  the  same  as  HRT  as\nvolume was removed from the reactor as mixed liquor. The relatively high\nretention times were chosen in order to allow the growth of autotrophic bacteria,\nsince this is slower than the heterotrophic one in C. necator [80]. This is also evident,\nin activated sludge where the nitrifying bacteria, that are autotrophic, have slower\ngrowth rates than the heterotrophic bacteria [64].\n\nOn day 3, 4, 7 and 10 approximately 1/3 of the total volume of mixed liquor\nwas transferred to the accumulation reactor in order to test the sludge for its\ncapability to accumulate PHB, by supplying sufficient carbon source. The volume\nof the growth reactor was setback to 4 L by adding fresh activated sludge.\n\nOn days 14, 17, 21, 24, 28 and 31 the volume in excess in the growth reactor\nwas  purged,  so  the  volume  was  set  back  to  4L.  No  fresh  activated  sludge  was\nadded by this times.\n\n3.2.1.3 Accumulation tests\n\n The capability of the biomass selected in the growth reactor to produce and\nstore PHB was tested under both heterotrophic and autotrophic conditions. In\norder to the this, the mixed liquor withdrawn from the growth reactor on days 3, 4\nand 10 was re-inoculated in accumulation reactors.\n\nThe accumulation tests in heterotrophic conditions were carried out on days\n4  and  10  using  acetic  acid  as  carbon  and  energy  source.  The  accumulation  test  in\nautotrophic  conditions  were  carried  out  on  days  3  and  10  and  H2  was  used  as\nenergy source in order to allow the use of inorganic carbon sources. The detailed\noperation of the two reactors is explained below.\n\nThe PHB content and its production was evaluated by means of SLB.\n\n3.2.1.3.1 Accumulation test with acetic acid\n\n 1  L  of  sludge  from  the  growth  reactor  was  incubated  on  a  2  L  vessel.  The\nreactor was fed by the means of pH-stat, in order to dose a influent stream reach in\nacetic acid. The setpoint was defined to be at pH 7.2 (\u00b13%) and was controlled by\nPC-Panel  \u00b5DCU  software  and  a  pH  meter  Easyferm  plus  K8  425,  Hamilton\n\n\n\n29\n\nBonaduz  AG,  connected  to  a  Biostat\u00ae  A  plus  main  system,  by  Sartorius  BBI\nSystems.\n\nThe influent solution was prepared by diluting a solution of acetic acid 80 %\n(w/w) with water, to a final concentration of 40 g COD/L. No other nutrient\nsources were added and no pH corrections were done to the influent stream.\n\nThe  reactor  medium  was  kept  under  constant  stirring  by  means  of  an\nelectrical pump, while air was provided through fine bubbling.\n\n3.2.1.3.2 Accumulation test with in autotrophic conditions\n\n 1 L of sludge from the growth reactor was incubated on a 2 liter vessel. The\nreactor  was  aerated  with  a  hydrogen  flow  of  50  mL  H2/min via fine bubbling. It\nwas considered that the bicarbonate resultant form the biomass degradation\nprocesses in the growth reactor was a sufficient source of inorganic carbon for\naccumulation. Therefore, no other carbon source was added to the medium, with\nexception to the normal carbon dioxide content in the air stream.\n\n3.2.2 Production of PHB by ADF (Chapter 5)\n\nProduction of PHB by ADF was carried out in a two steps system consisting\nof a growth reactor and an accumulation reactor. The growth reactor was used for\nthe selection and growth of PHB-producing bacteria, by submitting activated\nsludge  to  aerobic  dynamic  feeding  conditions.  The  volume  in  excess  on  this\ngrowth reactor was then transferred to an accumulation reactor, where the carbon\nsource (acetic acid) was supplied in excess to the selected microbial community, so\nPHB could be produced and stored by the PHB-producing bacteria. A diagram of\nthe process is presents in Figure 6.\n\nTo  achieve  this,  activated  sludge  was  collected  from  a  brewery  wastewater\ntreatment plant, which was operated in a SBR system (described in Chapter 3.1).\nThe  collected  sludge  was  left  to  settle  in  a  cold  room  overnight,  after  which  the\nsupernatant was discarded ( 50% of the total volume) prior to be incubated in the\ngrowth reactor.\n\nThis  system  was  tested  for  a  total  of  64  days  and  several  operation\nparameters were tested over time, for both the growth reactor and the\n\n\n\n30\n\naccumulation reactor. However, due to the instability of the reactor it was\nnecessary to restart the growth reactor with fresh sludge on 2 instances, for a total\nof  3  runs.  This  implied  that  the  microbial  community  in  the  growth  reactor  was\nnot  kept  after  each  restart.  In  regard  to  the  results,  these  3  runs  will  be  referred\nhenceforward as \"PHB production A\", \"PHB production B\" and \"PHB production\nC\".  Each  one  of  these  systems  will  be  addressed  in  a  different  subchapter\ncomprising the growth reactor and the accumulation reactors.\n\nThe operation parameters of the reactors were different from reactor to\nreactor  and  varied  over  time  according  to  the  results,  the  observations  made  and\nthe  knowledge  gathered  with  the  previous  trials.  These  are  explained  in  further\ndetail below.\n\nThe methods of analysis used are the ones explained in Chapter 3. PHB was\nquantified by extraction with 1,2-propylene carbonate.\n\nH2\n\nO2H2\n\nH2\n\nO2\nH2\n\nH2\n\nO2\n\nH2\n\nGrowth Reactor Accumulation\nBatch\n\nAir\nPump\n\nBatch\nInfluent\n\nGrowth Reactor\nInfluent\n\nFigure 6 - Diagram of the process of production of PHB by ADF\n\n\n\n31\n\n3.2.2.1 PHB prodution A\n\n3.2.2.1.1 Growth reactor - A\n\nA  5  L  reactor  was  incubated  with  2  L  of  the  decanted  activated  sludge.  The\nsystem was operated in an aerobic dynamic feeding regime (feast &amp; famine), with\n3  cycles  of  8  hours  per  day.  It  was  intended  that  the  feast  phase  occurred  during\nthe first 2 h 30 of each cycle, for a maximum feast/famine ratio of 0.45. For that, 200\nML  of  fresh  influent  were  added  to  the  medium  per  cycle.  The  extension  of  the\nfeast phase was controlled by regulating the COD concentration of the influent,\nhaving  in  consideration  the  values  of  the  analysis  done  to  the  reactor's  medium\nduring the cycle. The influent composition can be verified in Appendix A.\n\n600  mL  of  volume  were  withdrawn  from  the  reactor  each  day,  in  order  to\nmaintain  the  HRT  at  4.33  days.  However,  this  was  not  possible  on  days  4  and  5,\nand  11  and  12.  As  a  result,  on  days  6  and  13  the  HRT  was  off  6.33.  This  gives  an\naverage  HRT  of  5.13  days.  Since  there  was  no  settling  phase  and  the  volume  of\nsludge in excess was withdrawn as mixed liquor, the SRT was equal to the HRT.\n\nThe  medium  was  continuously  supplied  with  oxygen,  via  aeration  through\naeration stone, and stirred at  300 rpm. pH was controlled, fist using HCl 1 M and\nwith H2SO4 1 M after day 10,  in order to keep the culture medium at pH  8.5.\n\n3.2.2.1.2 Accumulation reactors - A\n\nNo accumulation tests were carried out during this period.\n\n3.2.2.2 PHB Production B\n\n3.2.2.2.1 Growth reactor - B\n\nA  5  L  reactor  was  then  incubated  with  the  2  L  of  activated  sludge.  The\nmedium  of  growth  reactor  A  was  neutralized  with  sodium  hydroxide  and  the\nbiomass  was  recovered  by  centrifugation  at  3,000  rpm  for  10  minutes,  while  the\n\n\n\n32\n\nsupernatant was discarded. The recovered biomass was in the activated sludge\ninoculated.\n\nThe  system  was  operated  in  an  aerobic  dynamic  feeding  regime  (feast  &amp;\nfamine),  with  3  cycles  of  8  hours  per  day.  It  was  intended  that  the  feast  phase\noccurred  during  the  first  2  h  30  of  each  cycle.  For  that,  200  ML  of  fresh  influent\nwere added to the medium per cycle, using a peristaltic pump with a flow rate of\n6.66  mL/min.  Initially,  this  volume  was  completely  fed  in  single  feed  pulse  of  30\nminuts, at the start of each feast phase. On day 11, the feed volume was split into\ntwo equal feed pulses of 15 minutes each, at 0.00 h and 1.00 h. This was changed\nagain  on  day  16,  to  3  equal  feed  pulses  of  10  minutes  each,  at  0.00  h,  0.75  h  and\n1.50 h of feast.\n\nThe  extension  of  the  feast  phase  was  controlled  by  regulating  the  COD\nconcentration of the influent, having in consideration the values of the analysis\ndone to the reactor's medium during the cycle.  The composition o of the influents\nused can be observed on Appendix A.\n\n600  mL  of  volume  were  withdrawn  from  the  reactor  each  day,  in  order  to\nmaintain the HRT at 4.33 days. However, this was not possible on days 5 - 6, 12 -\n 13, 19 - 20 and 26 - 27. As a result, on days 7, 14, 21 and 28 the HRT corresponded\nto  6.33  days.  This  gave  an  average  HRT  of  5.08  days.  Since  there  was  no  settling\nphase and the volume of sludge in excess was withdrawn as mixed liquor, the SRT\nwas  design  to  be  equal  to  the  HRT.  Nevertheless,  this  was  not  verified  on  days  7\nand  14,  as  the  biomass  was  recovered  from  the  withdrawn  mixed  liquor,  by\ncentrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes, and re-inoculated back again in the\ngrowth reactor.\n\nOn  day  28,  2  L  of  mixed  liquor  were  replaced  by  2  L  of  fresh  activated\nsludge. The biomass from this mixed liquor was also recovered by centrifugation\nand re-inoculated in the growth reactor.\n\nThe  medium  was  continuously  supplied  with  oxygen,  via  aeration  through\naeration stone, and stirred at  300 rpm. pH was controlled, first using HCl 1 M\nand with H2SO4 1 M after day 10,  in order to keep the culture medium at pH  8.5.\n\n3.2.2.2.2 Accumulation reactors - B\n\nAccumulation tests were performed on the activated sludge from growth\nreactor  B  on  days  2,  7,  10,  15  and  21  of  this  reactor.  In  order  to  carry  this  out,   a\n\n\n\n33\n\n2000  mL  reactor  was  incubated  with  400  mL  of  mixed  liquor  from  the  growth\nreactor,  except  on  day  7  where  the  accumulation  reactor  was  incubated  with  500\nmL.  The  mixed  liquor  was  always  taken  from  the  growth  reactor  at  the  end  of\nfeast phase.\n\nThe accumulation reactors were operated in a feed pulse strategy, with the\nmedium being fed every 3 hours with 13.3 mL of synthetic influent, for a total of 8\nfeed  pulses  per  day.  On  the  accumulation  test  of  day  21  this  was  changed  to  20\nfeed  pulses  per  day,  where  6.7  mL  of  synthetic  influent  were  added  every  72\nminutes.  The  influent  solution  was  composed  only  by  acetic  acid/acetate  and\nammonium chloride, with a COD/N ratio of 100/1 on days 2, 7 and 10 and with a\nCOD/N  ratio  of  100/2  on  days  15  and  21.  This  solution  was  prepared  so  the\nvolumetric loading rate in the fill up reactor would be eight thirds (8/3) of the\nvolumetric loading rate applied on the growth reactor on that day.\n\nThe  HRT  and  SRT  of  the  accumulation  reactors  was  kept  at  1  day.  The\nmedium  was  continuously  supplied  with  oxygen,  via  aeration  through  aeration\nstone, and constantly stirred.\n\n3.2.2.3 PHB Production C\n\n3.2.2.3.1 Growth reactor - C\n\nA  6  L  reactor  was  incubated  with  3  L  of  the  decanted  activated  sludge.  The\nsystem was operated in an aerobic dynamic feeding regime (feast &amp; famine), with\n3  cycles  of  8  hours  per  day.  It  was  intended  that  the  feast  phase  occurred  during\nthe first 2 h 30 of each cycle, for a maximum feast/famine ratio of 0.45. For that, 400\nmL  of  fresh  influent  were  added  to  the  medium  per  cycle.  This  volume  was\nincreased to 500 mL on day 14 and forward. These volumes were fed over 6 feed\npulses, 1 each 25 minutes, for 10 and 12 minutes respectively.  The extension of the\nfeast  phase  was  controlled  by  the  DO  values  and  confirmed  by  GC  analysis.  The\ncomposition of the influents used can be observed on Appendix A.\n\nThe  reactor  conditions  were  designed  for  an  active  volume  of  4.2  L  and  a\nHRT  of  3.5  days.  With  the  increase  of  the  volume  fed  per  cycle  on  day  14,  these\nparameters  were  changed  to  an  active  volume  of  4.5  L  and  a  HRT  of  3.5  days.  In\norder to do so, 1200 mL of mixed liquor were withdrawn from the growth reactor\n\n\n\n34\n\neach  day,  from  day  1  to  day  14,  being  this  volume  increased  to  1.5  L  afterwards.\nSince  there  was  no  settling  phase  and  the  volume  of  sludge  in  excess  was\nwithdrawn as mixed liquor, the SRT was equal to the HRT.\n\nThe  medium  was  continuously  supplied  with  oxygen,  via  aeration  through\n\naeration  stone,  and  stirred  at   300  rpm.  pH  was  controlled  using   H2SO4 1  M  at\n\npH  8.5, in order to prevent the conversion of ammonium to ammonia.\n\n3.2.2.3.2  Accumulation reactors - C\n\nAccumulation  tests  were  performed  in  a  2  L  reactor.  For  this,  1200  mL  of\nmixed  liquor  were  withdrawn  from  growth  reactor  C   at  the  end  of  feast  phase.\nThe mixed liquor was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3,000 rpm in order to remove\nthe supernatant, so the nutrients of the growth reactor medium wouldn't interfere\nwith accumulation test. The pellet was used to incubate the accumulation reactor.\nOn days 7, 8 and 9 the pellet was resupended on 1000 mL of tap water, while on\ndays 13 and 14 the volume of water was increased to 1200 mL.\n\n  The  accumulation  reactor  was  fed  every  72  minutes  with  a  4  minutes  feed\npulse  having  a  flowrate  of  6.66  mL/min.  As  a  result,  0.5  L  were  fed  over  the  22\nhours of the fed batch. On days 7, 8 and 9 the influent solution was composed by\nacetic acid/acetate and ammonium chloride in a COD/N ratio of 100/1, while on\ndays 13 and 14 it was composed only of acetic acid/sodium acetate. This solution\nwas prepared so the volumetric loading rate in the fill up reactor would be 3 time\nhigher than the volumetric loading rate of the growth reactor.\n\nThe medium was continuously supplied with oxygen, through fine bubbling\nand constantly stirred.\n\n3.2.3 Production of PHB enriched SCP (Chapter 6)\n\nActivated  sludge  was  collected  from  the  brewery's  WWTP  operated  in  SBR\ndescribed  in  Chapter  3.1.  The  sludge  was  left  to  settle  for  an  hour,  after  which  it\nwas decanted to 50 % of its initial volume and stored at 4 \u00b0C till being used.\n\nThe  reactor  was  operated  in  fed-batch  mode.  The  feed  of  the  reactor  was\ncontrolled  by  pH-stat,  with  a  setpoint  of  8,2.  The  influent  used  had  a  COD\n\n\n\n35\n\nconcentration  of  60  g/L,  being  50  %  of  it  acetic  acid  and  the  other  50  %  sodium\nacetate. The pH of the influent was corrected to 4.75 using sodium hydroxide and\nno further nutrients were used.\n\nFor the test batch,  3 L of decanted sludge were diluted in 3 L of fresh water\nand inoculated in a 10 L reactor. In the third batch, the reactor was inoculated with\n6 L of decanted activated sludge, diluted in 6 L of fresh water.\n\nEvery  batch  was  operated  overnight  and  stopped  in  the  next  morning.  The\nfinal  volume  of  the  reactor  and  the  volume  of  influent  fed  were  evaluated.  The\nsludge was left to settle and the water in excess (around 45% of the total volume)\nwas decanted. The sludge was poured into trays and dried overnight, at 60 \u00b0C, in\norder to form flocks.\n\nTSS,  VSS  and  VFA  were  analyzed  at  the  beginning  and  end  of  the  batch  as\ndescribed  previously.  The  PHB  content  was  evaluated  gravimetrically,  after\ncellular lysis with a hypochlorite solution and recovery using propylene\ncarbonate, as described in more detail in Chapter 7.\n\n3.2.4 Development of a new method for PHB quantification\n(Chapter 7)\n\nThe method develop for the quantification of PHB was based on the\ngravimetric analysis of PHB. This consists of 3 main steps, namely (1) the lysis of\nthe PHB containing cells; (2) the dissolution on PHB and separation from the\ncellular debris; (3) and the recovery of the PHB polymer.\n\n3.2.4.1 Cellular lysis\n\nIn order to allow a better recovery of the polymer, the cell must be lysed so\nthe  solvent  can  easily  access  the  intracellular   PHB.  Two  methods  were  used  to\ncause  cellular  disruption.  One  based  on  the  mechanical  disruption  of  cells  due  to\nthe  increased  volume  of  water  when  frozen,  and  other  based  on  the  chemical\ndigestion of cells by hypochlorite.\n\n\n\n36\n\n3.2.4.1.1 Freeze and thaw cycles\n\nSamples  of  20  mL  of  sludge  were  collected  into  falcon  tubes.  They  samples\nwere centrifuged at 10.000 rpm for 10 minutes, after which the supernatant was\ndiscarded and the pellet resuspended in demineralised water. Then, the samples\nwere immediately placed in a freezer in order to froze. After being completely\nfrozen, the sample was place in a warm bath till it was completely defrosted again.\nDuring  thaw  the  sample  was  shaken  several  times.  The  freeze  and  thaw  was\nrepeated more two times before other analysis were carried.\n\nThis  step  was  used  for  PHB  quantification  throughout  Chapter  5  and\nChapter 6.\n\n3.2.4.1.2 Hypochlorite digestion\n\nSamples of 20 mL of sludge were collected into falcon tubes and centrifuge it\nfor 10 minutes at 10,000 rpm. The supernatants were then discarded and the pellet\nwas resuspended in 20 mL of a hypochlorite solution 20\u00b0 (6% of active chlorine).\n\nAfter  5  minutes,  1  mL  of  H2SO4 1M  was  added  to  each  sample  in  order  to\nneutralize  the  pH  of  the  solution.  This  would  protect  the  PHB  from  being\nhydrolyzed. The addition of acid may originate chlorine gas, so it was done inside\na fume hood. The samples were then immediately centrifuged at 10,000. The\nsupernatant was discarded and the pellet rinsed with dematerialized water. The\nsamples  were  centrifuge  once  again  for  10  minutes  at  10,000  rpm  and  the\nsupernatants were discarded.\n\n3.2.4.2 Extraction with chloroform\n\nThe sludge in the falcon tubes was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 minutes\nafter  which  the  supernatant  was  discarded  and  the  pellet  rinsed  with\ndemineralized water. The solution was submitted to another centrifugation, in the\nsame condition, and the supernatant was discarded again.\n\nThe  pellet  was  then  washed  from  the  falcon  tube  to  a  schott  bottle  with  30\nmL of choroform and then incubated at 37 \u00baC overnight, under constant stirring.\nIn  the  next  day,  the  chloroform  solutions  were  vacuum  filtered  using  fiber  glass\nfilters  (0.45  \u00b5m  of  pore  size,  binding  agents  free)  in  order  to  withdraw  the  non\n\n\n\n37\n\ndissolved biomass, washing the schott bottles and filters with additional 5 mL of\nchloroform. The chloroform solution containing the dissolved PHA was then\npoured into pre-weighted crucibles and the filtration flask was rinsed with\nmethanol.\n\n The  chloroform  and  methanol  in  the  crucibles  were  let  to  dry  overnight  at\nroom temperature in order to evaporate both the chloroform and methanol and\nfurther  dried  at  105  \u00baC  to  remove  water.  After  cooling  down  the  crucibles  were\nreweighted.\n\n3.2.4.3 Extraction with 1,2-propylene carbonate\n\n The sludge in the falcon tubes was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 minutes\nafter  which  the  supernatant  was  discarded  and  the  pellet  rinsed  with\ndemineralized water. The solution was submitted to another centrifugation, in the\nsame condition, and the supernatant was discarded again.\n\nThe pellet was then washed from the falcon tube to a COD tube with 20 mL\nof  propylene  carbonate  and  incubated  at  130  \u00baC,  for  at  least  15  minutes,  with\nperiodic shaking. These solutions were vacuum filtered afterwards with fiber glass\nfilters  (0.45  \u00b5m  of  pore  size,  binding  agents  free)  pre-warmed  with  propypylene\ncarbonate  at  130  \u00baC.  The  COD  tubes  and  filters  were  washed  with  additional  20\nmL of warm propylene carbonate. The filtered solution was stored in schott bottles\nand the PHA was precipitated with 4 volumes of cold methanol.\n\nAfter one day, the precipitated PHA was vacuum filtered with pre-weighted\nfiber glass filters. The cakes were washed with methanol in order to remove traces\nof  propylene  carbonate  and  dried  overnight  at  105  \u00baC.  After  cooling  down  the\nfilters were weighted again in order to access the amount of material recovered.\n\n3.3 Analythical methods\n\n3.3.1 Biomass Quantification\n\n Biomass was quantified gravimetrically through the determination of Total\nSuspended Solids (TSS), Volatile Suspended Solids (VSS) and Stored Lipidic\nBiomass (SLB) / PHB content.\n\n\n\n38\n\nTSS was determined as the remaining residue of a sample after drying at 105\n\u00b0C, from which the suspended matter was previously separated from the medium,\nnormally through filtration [64].\n\nVSS  was  determined  as  the  part  of  TSS  that  volatizes  at  600  \u00b0C.  This  is\nconsidered to represent the organic fraction of the sample [64].\n\nStored lipidic content (SLB)  was determined as the part of TSS that volatizes\nat  250  \u00b0C.  This  method  was  developed  at  Avecom  previously  to  this  work  and  is\nconsidered to represent the PHB content in the samples. This method was only\nused  throughout  Chapter  4  and  was  then  replaced  by  the  method  for  PHB\nquantification by extraction with propylene carbonate.\n\n3.3.1.1 TSS\n\n Samples of 20 mL were collected from the biorreactors into 50 mL falcon\ntubes. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm, for 10 minutes in a Eppendorf\nCentrifuge 5810. The supernatants were then discarded and the pellet was\nresuspended in demineralized water. Next, the resuspended pellets were\ncentrifuged again using the same conditions as before, after which the supernatant\nwas discarded again.\n\nThe pellet was then transferred to dry porcelain crucible, pre-weighet using a\nSartorius  TE64  Analytic  Balance.  After  that,  the  crucibles  with  the  samples  were\ndried overnight in a oven from Memmert at 105 \u00b0C. Next day, the crucibles were\nlet  to  cool  down  in  an  exicator  for  one  hour,  before  weighting  them  again.  TSS\ncontent  was  given  by  the  difference  between  the  porcelain  crucible  with  the  dry\nmatter  and  the  porcelain  crucible  as  such,  divided  by  the  volume  of  sample\n(Equation 1, Appendix B).\n\n3.3.1.2 VSS\n\nVSS was quantified after the determination of the TSS from the samples. For\nthat,  the  crucible  with  the  dry  matter  was  placed  in  a  Nabertherm  GmbH  LE\n4/11/R6  incinerator  at  600  \u00b0C  for  2  hours.  After  cooling  down  in  an  exicator,  the\nporcelain crucible was weighted and the PHB content was given by the difference\nbetween the weight of the crucible with the dry matter and the weight of the\ncrucible with the ashes, divided by the sample volume (Equation 2, Appendix B)\n\n\n\n39\n\n3.3.1.3 PHB quantification as SLB\n\nWhen SLB determination was needed, this step was performed  between TSS\nand VSS determination. After determining TSS, the porcelain crucible with the\ndried biomass was placed in a  Nabertherm GmbH LE 4/11/R6 incinerator at 250\n\u00b0C  for  2  hours.  After  cooling  down,  the  porcelain  crucible  was  weighted  and  the\namount  of  SLB  was  given  by  the  difference  between  the  weight  of  the  crucible\nwith  the  dry  matter  and  the  weight  of  the  crucible  with  the  remaining  biomass\nafter 250 \u00b0C, divided by the sample volume (Equation 3, Appendix B)\n\nVSS could be determined afterwards, using the procedure described\npreviously.\n3.3.1.4 PHB quantification by extraction with propylene carbonate\n\n PHB was quantified gravimetrically after extraction with 1,2-propylene\ncarbonate (Equation 4, Appendix B), using a procedure developed at Avecom\nduring this disseration. The method consisted of cellular lyses by freeze and thaw\ncycles, followed by the extraction of PHB using 1,2-propylene carbonate. This\nprocedure was described above, in Chapter 3.2.4 - Development of a new method\nfor PHB quantification. This method is discussed further in Chapter 7.\n\n3.3.2 pH\n\nThe pH of the samples was measured using the pH meter Consort C535.\n\n3.3.3 Dissolved oxygen (DO)\n\nThe dissolved oxygen of the reactor was measured using the meter WTW Oxi\n315i.\n\n3.3.4 Soluble Chemical oxygen demand (COD)\n\nChemical  oxygen  demand  was  measured  photometrically  with  a  HACH\nLange DR3900 Photometer using the commercial kits LCK 014 and LCK 514 as\n\n\n\n40\n\nindicated by the manufacturer. The samples were previously centrifuged at 10000\nrpm for 10 min (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5810) in order to remove suspend solids.\n\n3.3.5 Total nitrogen (TKN)\n\nTotal nitrogen was measured photometrically with a HACH Lange DR3900\nPhotometer  using  the  commercial  kit  LCK  338  as  indicated  by  the  manufacturer.\nThe samples were previously centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min (Eppendorf\nCentrifuge 5810) in order to remove suspend solids.\n\n3.3.6 Ammonium (NH4+-N)\n\nAmmonium (NH4+-N)  was  measured  photometrically  with  a  HACH  Lange\nDR3900 Photometer using the commercial kits LCK 302 and LCK 303 as indicated\nby the manufacturer. The samples were previously centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10\nmin (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5810) in order to remove suspend solids.\n\n3.3.7 Nitrate (NO3--N)\n\nNitrate (NO3--N)  was  measured  photometrically  with  a  HACH  Lange\nDR3900 Photometer using the commercial kits LCK 339 and LCK 340 as indicated\nby the manufacturer. The samples were previously centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10\nmin (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5810) in order to remove suspend solids.\n\n3.3.8 Orthophosphate-phosphorus (PO4-3-P)\n\nOrthophosphate-phosphorus (PO4-3-P) was measured photometrically with a\nHACH Lange DR3900 Photometer using the commercial kit LCK 348 and LCK 350\nas  indicated  by  the  manufacturer.  The  samples  were  previously  centrifuged  at\n10000 rpm for 10 min (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5810) in order to remove suspend\nsolids.\n\n\n\n41\n\n3.3.9 Volatile fatty acids (VFA)\n\nThe concentration of VFA was determined by the standard method of\npartition of the VFA from samples using diethylether, followed by gas\nchromatography analysis of the organic phase as described in [81].\n\n For this 2 mL of sample, 0.5 mL of H2SO4 solution, 0.4 g of NaCl, 0.4 mL of\ninternal standard solution (2-methyl hexanoic acid) and 2 mL of diethyether were\nintroduced  into  a  centrifuge  tube.  The  tubes  were  then  mixed  for  2  min  and\ncentrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 minutes (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5810). Subsequently,\nthe  etheric  layer  was  transferred  into  a  GC  vial,  in  which  the  short  chain  fatty\nacids (SCFA) were extracted.\n\n The extracts (1 \u00b5L of extract) were analyzed using a GC-2014 gas\nchromatograph,  equipped  with  an  Auto  injector  AOC-20i  and  an  auto  sampler\nAOC-20s, all from Shimadzu. The temperature profile was set from 110 to 165 \u00baC,\nwith  a  temperature  increase  of  6  \u00baC  per  minute.  The  temperature  of  the  injector\nwas 220 \u00b0C, and the temperature of the sampler was 200 \u00baC. Nitrogen was used as\na carrier gas.\n\n\n\n42\n\n4 Hydrocell\n\n4.1 Background\n\nIn some european countries is not uncommon that private companies\nproduce  and  sell  electricity  from  renewable  sources,  as  a  complement  to  their\nmain  activity.  One  example  of  this  is  the  generation  of  electricity  by  the  burn  of\nbiogas from the anaerobic treatment of wastewaters or by wind turbines.\n\n However, electricity production has to be toughly controlled, since it cannot\nbe stored in a significant way. Its production must always correspond to the\namount being consumed. Otherwise the grid would be over or under charged. As\na  result,  sometimes  the  biogas  has  to  be  flared  or  the  wind  turbines  stopped  in\norder  to  avoid  electric  peaks  in  the  grid  thus  wasting  a  significant  amount  of\nenergy,  that  could  be  valorised [82]. Furthermore, outside peak hours electricity\nvalue is only of 0.05 \u20ac/kWh [83].\n\n It  would  be  interesting  to  valorise  these  surplus  of  energy  and  cheap\nelectricity. One possibility is to use this electricity in the electrolysis of water\ntowards molecular hydrogen and oxygen [84]. Some microorganisms can use\nmolecular hydrogen as an energy source in their metabolism. If these\nmicroorganisms  are  capable  of  growing  and  deliver  a  product  with  high  value,\nthen this process can be economically feasible.\n\n The use of molecular hydrogen as an energy source is widely described for\nautotrophic microorganisms, who use inorganic carbon, such as carbon dioxide, as\na carbon source [50]. CO2 is  a  major  gaseous  waste  stream  in  industry  and  other\nhuman  activities  and  plays  a  major  role  in  global  warming.  This  gaseous  waste\nstreams could be used to feed bacteria in bioreactors. Another source of CO2 could\nbe biogas, as it is represents roughly 35% of its composition, being the rest mainly\nmethane. If microorganisms could remove CO2 from biogas, its quality would be\nupgraded.\n\nElectrolysis  of  water  is  an  economical  and  environmental  friendly  process,\nwith an yield of 65 - 80%. At the maximum yield, 1 kWh of electricity generats 9.14\nmol of H2, which correspond to 228 L of this gas at standard ambient temperature\nand  pressure  (SATP).  This  is  equivalent  to  146  g  COD  generated  per  kWh  of\nelectricity consumed, since 1 mol of H2 has COD of 16 g [85].\n\n\n\n43\n\nIn electrolysis, the distinction between cathode and anode is not based on the\nelectric charge applied on the electrode, but rather on the electronegativity of the\ngas  formed.  Therefore,  the  cathode  is  where  the  hydrogen  gas  is  produced,\nregardless being negatively charged and the anode is where the oxygen is formed,\nalthough the electrode is positively charged. The anode (oxygen formation,\npositively charged electrode) is typically made of nickel and copper, coated with\noxides of metals such as manganese, tungsten and ruthenium. While the cathode\n(hydrogen  formation,  negatively  charged  electrode)  is  typically  made  of  nickel,\ncoated with small quantities of platinum [86].\n\nThe autotrophic production of PHA by pure cultures of C. necator was\nalready  demonstrated  in  the  literature  with  fairly  good  results.  It  was  possible  to\nattain  a  biomass  concentration  of  69.3  g/L  and  a  PHA  concentrarion  of  54.6  g/L,\nwhich represents a PHA content of 81.4 % (w/w). This was achieved after 92 hours\nand the productivity was of 0.61 g.L-1.h-1 [87].  In another system, specially designed\nfor  high  KLa values (a value of 2970 h-1), the biomass concentration was 85.7 g/L\nafter  45  hours.  From  this  biomass  71.8  %  (w/w)  was  PHA,  which  corresponds  to\n61.5 g PHA/L [88].  On  the  other  hand,  the  use  of  the  mixed  cultures  for  the\nautotrophic production of PHB was already tried at Avecom with poor results\n(results not published).\n\nIn  this  experiment  mixed  cultures  were  submitted  to  aerobic  dynamic\nfeeding conditions  in a H2 enriched media. The purpose of this was to find out if\nthe use of H2 may act as a selective pressure for the enhanced production of PHB.\n\n4.2 Results and discussion\n\n4.2.1 Growth reactor\n\nThe growth reactor was incubated with activated sludge from protein\nprocessing factory's WWTP, which was operated in SBR. This represents a nice\nsource of activated sludge for the production of PHB, as the microbial community\nis adapted to live under the transient conditions of a SBR system [18]\n\nThe  reactor  was  maintained  over  a  period  of  32  days.  The  evolution  of  the\nbiomass of the concentration the growth reactor can be observed in Figure 7.\n\n\n\n44\n\nFigure 7 - Biomass concentration as TSS and VSS and SLB content (g SLB/g VSS) in the Hydrocell's\ngrowth reactor at the end of feast phase, over a period of 32 days . The dashed vertical lines indicate\nthe times when part of the mixed liquor was replaced by fresh activated sludge.\n\n During this time, there was a small, but rather constant increase in the VSS,\nfrom 8.15 g VSS/L on day 0 to 11.49 g VSS/L on day 32. Simultaneously, there was\na  decrease  in  the  difference  between  TSS  and  VSS  values,  from  a  VSS/TSS  ratio\n(Equation 6, Appendix B) of 58 % in day 0 to 83 % on day 28 which indicates that\nnon  organic  material  was  being  removed  from  the  reactor.  The  TSS  value\nincreased  abruptly  on  days  31  and  32  due  to  the  fragmentation  in  the  reactor  of\none of the aeration stones.\n\nThe highest verified specific growth (Equation 14 and 15, Appendix B) rate\nwas  of  0.09  h-1 on  days  18  (0  -  1  h  feast)  and  on  day  25  (0  -  2  h  feast),  while  the\naverage specific growth rate was of 0.06 h-1. These values fall far behind 0.19 h-1 [14],\nthat was the maximum value found in the literature, but it was close to the value\nof  0.10  h-1 previously  reported  as  the  maximum  one [89]. This value was achieved\nwhile  submitting  a  pure  culture  of Paracoccus pantotrophus (a PHA-producing\nbacteria commonly present in WWTPs) to ADF conditons, in order to study the\neffect of the feast and famine cycles [90].\n\nThis  maximum  value  of  specific  growth  rate   on  day  18  was  simultaneous\nwith  the  maximum  observed  VSS  yield  of  0.49  g  VSS/g  COD  (Equation  8,\nAppendix  B).  Similar  yield  values  were  observed  on  days  3  and  5,  but  it  is  not\nclear if in these days this was a result of the cellular growth or due to the storage\nof PHB, as nitrogen consumption was not evaluated during these days. These\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n0.0 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 25.0 30.0\n\nB\nio\n\nm\nas\n\ns\n(g\n\n/L\n)\n\nTime (d)\n\nTSS VSS SLB\n\n\n\n45\n\nyield values, as well as the volumetric loading rate (Equation 12, Appendix B) and\nsludge loading rate (Equation 13, Appendix B) can be observed in Figure 8.\n\nFigure 8 - VLR, SLR and VSS Yields on the Hydrocell's growth reactor. The dashed vertical lines\nindicate the times when part of the mixed liquor was replaced by fresh activated sludge.\n\nThe  observed VSS yield was highly inconstant, most likely due to the\nchanges in the hydraulic retention and the replacement of part of the growth\nreactor mixed liquor with fresh sludge. Actually, the yields seemed to stabilize\nafter day 17, as the HRT and SRT started to be more tightly controlled.\n\nThere is not a clear explanation for what cause the low yield values on day 26\nand 32. This seems to correspond to the days where the SLR was higher, with 0.41\ng  COD/g  VSS  and  0.44  g  COD/g  VSS  respectively.  In  fact,  from  day  25  to  26  the\ninfluent  concentration  was  increased  from   35  g  COD/L  as  acetic  acid  to  40  g\nCOD/L and on day 32 the influent concentration was already at 50 g COD/L.\nNevertheless this can be related either with the higher SLR, since it was already\nshowed that higher loading rates result in lower yields [91].\n\nThe loading rates were gradually increased after day 18, maintaining a feast\nphase duration of 2.5 hours. This explains the increase in VSS already stated\npreviously. In fact the values of VSS are higher than those found in the literature,\nwhere   a  value  of  6.8  g  VSS/L  can  be  taken  as  good  reference  for  this  type  of\nsystem [21]. However, these high cellular concentrations are irrelevant if the\nbacteria are not capable to effectively produce and store PHB.\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n5.0\n\n6.0\n\n7.0\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nSL\nR\n\n(g\nC\n\nO\nD\n\n.g\nV\n\nSS\n-1\n\n.d\n-1\n\n)\nY\n\nie\nld\n\n(g\nV\n\nSS\n.g\n\nC\nO\n\nD\n-1\n\n)\n\nV\nLR\n\n(g\nC\n\nO\nD\n\n.L\n-1\n\n.d\n-1\n\n)\n\nTime (d)\n\nVLR SLR VSS Yield\n\n\n\n46\n\nThe evolution of the PHB content, measured as a ratio between SLB and VSS\n(Equation 7, Appendix B) can be observed in Figure 9. However, the quantification\nof PHB as SLB revealed to be unreliable, as more extensively described in Chapter\n7, so all the observations were made based on values that could be true or not.\n\nFigure 9 - PHB content (measured as the ratio between SLB and VSS) in Hydrocell's growth reactor at\nthe end of feast phase, during a period of 32 days. The dashed vertical lines indicate the times when\npart of the mixed liquor was replaced by fresh activated sludge.\n\nThe  highest  SLB  contents  at  the  end  of  feast  phase  was  achieved  on  day  10\nwith  the  SLB  accounting  for  51  %  (w/w)  of  the  VSS.  However,  this  value  was\nobserved  after  a  considerably  extended  famine  phase,  due  to  a  malfunction  with\nthe feeding pump, which resulted in a F/F ratio of 0.04 h/h. The increased famine\nphase  may  have  led  to  an  effective  selection  of  PHB-producing  bacteria,  that  had\nthe  polymer  stored  and  so  were  capable  of  surviving  without  an  external  carbon\nsource. When the normal reactor operation was resumed, the acetic acid fed must\nhave been rapidly for polymer synthesis in order to restore their PHB reserves,\nsince there was a strong internal limitation to growth [7].\n\nOn regular reactor operation, the highest value was verified on day 25 with a\nSLB  content  of  31  %  (w/w).  This  value  was  gradually  increasing  since  day  19,\nwhen the SLB content was only 20 % (w/w). This increase in SLB content\nhappened after the reactor's SRT and HRT started to be controlled more\njudiciously  and  with  the  increase  of  the  loading  rates,  as  observed  for  VSS.\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n0.0 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 25.0 30.0\n\n%\n(w\n\nSL\nB\n\n/w\nV\n\nSS\n)\n\nTime (d)\n\nPHB content\n\n\n\n47\n\nTherefore,  the  increase  on  VSS  during  this  time  was  mainly  due  to  the  increased\ncapability of the sludge to store PHB.\n\nHowever,  on  the  next  day,  the  SLB  content  decreased  to  17  %.  This\ncorresponds  to  the   first  day  of  feeding  with  40  g  COD/L  Appendix  A.  The\ndecrease in the SLB content justifies the low observed VSS yield value, however\nthis does not add extra clues to what might have happened.\n\nThe  analysis  of  nitrogen  concentration  in  the  medium  that  day  revealed  a\nconcentration  of  40  mg  N/L  before  the  beginning  of  the  feast  phase,  which\nindicated some accumulation of nitrogen in the reactor. Since there was a\nsignificant  increase  in  the  VSS,  while  the  SLB  contents  stayed  low,  it  is  valid  to\npropose that concentration of nitrogen led to a shift in the metabolism, from PHB\naccumulation to growth.\n\nHowever,  this  was  against  what  was  observed  from  day  31  to  32  with  an\nincrease in the SLB content from 16 % to 26 %, even with a small decrease in VSS.\nThe nitrogen concentration on day 32 was evaluated again prior to feeding and the\nit  was  100  mg  N/L,  which  clearly  shows  that  nitrogen  was  indeed  accumulating,\nbut does not seem to be related with the decrease in the SLB content.\n\nLooking to the results as a whole, it seems that the capacity of the bacteria to\nproduce  and  store  PHB  was  not  enhanced  over  time.  The  average  SLB  content  at\nthe end of feast phase was only of 25 %, while this value was of 26 % on day 0. In\nfact,  this  was  exactly  the  same  value  as  the  one  verified  on  day  32.  This  could\nmean that the conditions applied in the growth reactor may have not been\nsufficient for an effective selection of PHB-producing bacteria. However, the way\nthat the growth reactor was operated was not designed for a significant\naccumulation in PHB and so accumulation tests where necessary to determine the\ncapacity of the sludge to store PHB.\n\n4.2.2 Batch accumulation tests\n\n On days 3 and 10 autotrophic accumulation tests were started\nsimultaneously with a heterotrophic ones, so it was possible to compare the\nresults. However, the heterotrophic accumulation test started on day 3 overflowed\nwithout being possible to retrieve any values, therefore a new heterotrophic test\nwas started on day 4.\n\n\n\n48\n\n4.2.2.1 Acetic acid\n\nThe first accumulations test under heterotrophic conditions was started on\nday 4. The results of this test are exhibited on Table 4.\n\nTable 4 - Batch accumulation test using acetic acid on day 4 of the growth reactor\nParameter Unit\nTime h 0 24\nBiomass concentration\n- TSS g/L 11.15 11.48\n- VSS g/L 7.32 8.80\n- SLB g/L 1.40 3.55\n- NPCB g/L 5.92 5.25\nRatio\n- SLB/VSS % 19 40\n- SLB/TSS % 13 31\n- VSS/TSS % 66 77\nReactor Volume L 1.00 1.25\nCOD Fed g - 10.0\nVLR g COD/(L.d) - 8.00\nSLR g COD/(g VSS.d) - 0.90\nTotal biomass\n- TSS g 11.15 14.34\n- VSS g 7.32 11.00\n- SLB g 1.40 4.44\n- NPCB g 5.92 6.56\nYield\n- VSS g VSS/g COD - 0.37\n- SLB g SLB/g COD - 0.30\nProductivity\nrP g SLB/(L.h) - 0.10\nqP g SLB/(g X.h) - 0.02\n\n The SLB/VSS ratio more than doubled in the first heterotrophic test, from\n19%  at  0  hour  to  40%  of  SLB  content  after  24  hours.  Although  there  was  some\ncellular  growth,  as  the  total  non-PHB  cellular  mass  (Equation  5,  Appendix  B)\nincreased  from  5.92  g  to  6.56  g,  this  only  accounted  for  17  %  of  the  VSS  growth.\nThe PHB production yield of 0.30 g SLB/g COD (Equation 9, Appendix B)  was in\nthe range found in the literature for the production of PHB by mixed cultures, 0.25\n-  0.56  g  PHB/g  COD [14],   although  closer  to  the  lower  value.  The  specific\nproduction  rate  however  was  of  0.02  g  SLB.g  NPCB-1.h-1 which  is  way  below  the\nvalues found associated with those yields, that vary between 0.14 and 0.65 h-1 [14].\n\n\n\n49\n\nTable 5 - Batch accumulation test using acetic acid on day 10 of the growth reactor\nParameter Unit\nTime h 0 1 2.5 5.5 22\nBiomass\nconcentration\n- TSS g/L 10.22 9.98 10.02 10.43 11.75\n- VSS g/L 7.04 7.01 7.33 7.84 9.21\n- SLB g/L 3.59 3.41 3.85 4.63 4.01\n- NPCB g/L 3.45 3.60 3.48 3.21 5.2\nRatio\n- SLB/VSS % 51 49 53 59 44\n- SLB/TSS % 35 35 38 44 34\n- VSS/TSS % 69 70 73 75 78\nReactor Volume L 1 1.047 1.053 1.077 1.160\nCOD Fed g - 1.88 2.88 4.68 8.80\nVLR g COD/(L.d) - 1.80 2.74 4.35 7.59\nSLR g COD/(g VSS.d) - 0.25 0.37 0.55 1.46\nTotal biomass\n- TSS g 10.22 10.44 10.55 11.23 13.63\n- VSS g 7.04 7.34 7.72 8.44 10.68\n- SLB g 3.59 3.57 4.05 4.99 4.65\n- NPCB g 3.45 3.77 3.66 3.45 6.03\nYield\n- VSS/COD g/g - 0.16 0.24 0.30 0.41\n- SLB/COD g/g - 0.00 0.16 0.30 0.12\nProductivity\n- rP g SLB/(L.h) - -0.02 0.17 0.24 0.04\n- qP g SLB/(g VSS.h) - -0.01 0.05 0.07 0.01\n\nThe activated sludge used on this test already presented a high SLB content\nprior  to  the  accumulation  phase.  This  happened  by  coincidence,  as  this  was  the\nday in which a higher SLB content (51% of the VSS) was verified at the end of feast\nphase  in  the  growth  reactor.  Probably  due  to  this,  there  was  not  a  significant\nincrease in the SLB content over time, changing from biomass SLB content of 51 %\nat 0 hour to a maximum of 59 % after 5.5 hours. Nevertheless, the PHB production\nyields of 0.30 g SLB/g COD observed at that time was equal to that observed after\n24 hours in first accumulation test and so, it is also in range with the values of the\nliterature.  There  was  also  a  increase  in  the  volumetric  productivity  and  specific\nproduction rate regarding the first test, but the values are still lower than the ones\non the literature.\n\nIt is proposed that these low specific production rates are the result of a poor\nselection for PHB-producing bacteria in the growth reactor, as 10 days may not be\nenough  to  effectively  change  the  microbial  community.  This  may  be  particularly\n\n\n\n50\n\ntrue having into account the high HRT and SRT applied and the recurrent\naddition of fresh unaclimated activated sludge in the growth reactor.\n\nThere was no apparent reason for the decay in SLB content after 22 hours. It\nis  possible  to  verify  a  decrease  in  the  amount  of  COD  fed  per  time,  but  this  was\nprobably related with a decrease in the acetate consumption rate, as the PHB-\nproducing bacteria were becoming saturated. Furthermore, the SLR after 22 hours\nwas  above  1  g  COD.g  VSS-1.d-1 and  the  feeding  control  seemed  to  be  working\nnormally,  so  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  the  decrease  in  the  SLB  content  was  due  to\nbacteria starvation. It is possible that this unexpected value was caused by the lack\nof reproducibility of the method used to determine the SLB. This problem was\nonly detected afterwards and willl aborded more extensively in Chapter 7.\n\n4.2.2.2 Autotrophic conditions\n\nTable 6 - Batch accumulation test in autotrophic conditions on day 3 of the growth reactor\nParameter Unit\nTime h 0 21 24 48\nBiomass concentration\n- TSS g/L 13.11 12.22 12.01 9.26\n- VSS g/L 8.02 7.44 7.62 6.02\n- SLB g/L 1.80 2.42 1.78 1.33\n- NPCB g/L 6.22 5.02 5.84 4.69\nRatio\n- SLB/VSS % 22 33 23 22\n- SLB/TSS % 14 20 15 14\n- VSS/TSS % 61 61 63 65\nReactor Volume L 1 1 1 1\nCOD Fed as H2 g - 4.19 5.19 16.76\nYield\n- VSS g VSS/g COD - 0.00 0.00 0.00\n- SLB g SLB/g COD - 0.15 0.00 0.00\nProductivity\n- rP g SLB/(L.h) - 0.03 0.00 -0.01\n- qP g SLB/(g VSS.h) - 0.01 0.00 0.00\n\nThe maximum SLB content of 31 % (g SLB/g VSS) was verified after 21 hours,\nwith a yield of 0.15 g SLB/g COD as H2. After this, the  SLB content decrease to the\nsame  verified  at  0  hour.  Furthermore,  the  increase  in  the  amount  of  SLB  in  the\nreactor  was  not  followed  by  an  increase  in  VSS,  as  it  would  be  expected.  In  fact,\nVSS  decreases  in  all  the  observed  times.  If  the  increase  in  SLB  was  not  due  to  an\n\n\n\n51\n\nerror in its determination, it is only possible to assume that the cells that weren't\ncapable of live in the absence of an organic carbon source died and were lysed by\nthe others. This may imply that the increase in SLB was not due to the autotrophic\naccumulation  of  PHB  but  rather  to  the  used  of  the  cellular  debris  by  the  living\ncells.\n\nTable 7 - Batch accumulation test in autotrophic conditions on day 10 of the growth reactor\nParameter Unit\nTime h 0 1 2.5 5.5 22\nBiomass concentration\n- TSS g/L 10.22 9.98 10.10 9.92 10.25\n- VSS g/L 7.04 7.01 7.06 6.94 7.21\n- SLB g/L 3.59 3.41 3.66 2.90 1.89\n- NPCB g/L 3.45 3.60 3.40 4.04 5.32\nRatio\n- SLB/VSS % 51 49 52 42 26\n- SLB/TSS % 35 34 36 29 18\n- VSS/TSS % 69 70 70 70 70\nReactor Volume L 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00\nCOD Fed as H2 g - 2.14 5.63 11.79 47.14\nYield\n- VSS g VSS/g COD - 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00\n- SLB g SLB/g COD - 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00\nProductivity\n- rP g SLB/(L.h) - -0.18 0.03 -0.13 -0.08\n- qP g SLB/(g VSS.h) - -0.05 0.01 -0.03 -0.01\n\nThe trial carried out on day 10 shows a decreased in SLB with time, while the\nVSS remains considerably stable. This seems similar to the behaviour verified\nduring  a  famine  phase  under  excess  of  nutrients,  as  the  stored  PHB  seems  to  be\ngradually consumed while cellular growth is occurring [7].\n\n\n\n52\n\n5 Production of PHB by ADF\n\n5.1 Background\n\nThe production of PHB by submitting mixed cultures to aerobic dynamic\nfeeding conditions had already been researched at Avecom. This research result in\nthe scale up of the process to pilot scale, as part of a project for the profitable\ntreatment of waste water. The objective was to obtain a viable alternative to the\nproduction of methane through anaerobic digestion.\n\nTrials revealed a satisfactory capability of the biomass to accumulate PHB\n(data  now  shown).  However,   the  system  was  highly  unstable  and  the  biomass\nconcentration decayed overtime. This required the frequent addition of fresh\nsludge in order to maintain the process. After some months running the pilot and\nformulating a dried biomass product from the withdrawn mixed liquor, the\nproject  was  ceased.  In  this  way,  other  lines  of  research  could  be  followed.\nHowever, the interest of new partner companies in the production of biopolymers\nled to the restart of the development and production of PHB producing\ntechnologies.\n\nThe objective of this work was to develop a system for the stable production\nof PHB by mixed cultures in a two step system. The recovery and extraction of the\npolymer  from  the  biomass  was  also  of  interest,  as  it  was  required  for  other\nexperiments.\n\n5.2 Results and discussion\n\n5.2.1 PHB production A\n\n5.2.1.1 A - Growth reactor\n\nGrowth  reactor  A  was  operated  as  SBR,  without  settling  phase,  in  ADF\nconditions. A F/F ratio of 0.45 was chosen as previous tests carried out at Avecom\nshowed  that  this  ratio  offered  a  good  balance  between  growth  and  the  capability\nto store PHB (results not showed). This seems to be supported by the results found\nin the literature regarding the F/F ratio [7].\n\n\n\n53\n\nThe evolution of the biomass concentration in the growth reactor A can be\nobserved in Figure 10, while the VLR, SLR and biomass yield can be observed on\nFigure 11.\n\nThere were significant fluctuations of the concentration of biomass\n(measured as VSS) from day 0 to day 3. Upon inoculation, the concentration of\nbiomass in the reactor was of 5.25 g VSS/L. This value was lowered than expected\nhaving into account other samples from the brewery WWTP, that usually ranged\nbetween  10  and  15  g  VSS/L  after  being  decanted.  The  loading  rates  had  been\nplanned  for  high  cellular  concentration  and  so  they  were  excessive  for  this\nconcentration of biomass. Probably as a result, the biomass concentration\ndecreased to 4.09 g VSS/L on day 1. With the adjustment of the loading rates, there\nwas a increase in VSS on day 2 to 6.61 g/L, followed by another decrease to 5.7 g\nVSS/L on day 3.\n\nThe  concentration  of  biomass  seemed  to  have  stabilized  between  day  3  and\nday 6. By this time, it was verified that was possible to increase the VLR from 4.0 g\nCOD.L-1.d-1 to 5.8 g COD.L-1.d-1, as feast was lasting only 1h30. Initially, this led to\na  small  decrease  in  the  biomass  concentration  on  day  7  (5.09  g  VSS/L),  but  then\nVSS gradually increased till 6.37 g/L on day 9.\n\nOn day 10 the VLR increased again, to 7.4 g COD.L-1.d-1. As previously, this\nled to a decrease in VSS on day 10 to 5.54 g/L. During the next days, till day 13, the\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16\n\nB\nio\n\nm\nas\n\ns(\ng/\n\nL)\n\nTime (d)\n\nTSS VSS\n\nFigure 10 - Evolution of the concentration of TSS and VSS over a period of 17 days.\n\n\n\n54\n\nVLR gradually decreased to 5.1 g COD.L-1.d-1, since the volume in excess was not\npurged from the growth reactor and the same amount of COD was being fed each\ncycle. However, during this time biomass concentration increased by 44 % to 7.71\ng  VSS/L.  The  volume  in  excess  was  withdrawn  from  the  reactor  on  day  14,\nincreasing the VLR back to 7.4 g COD.L-1.d-1. This did not lead to a decrease in VSS\nthis time, in fact it increased to a maximum of 8.29 g VSS/L on the last day.\n\nThe decreases in the biomass concentration on days 7 and 10 may appear to\nbe  caused  by  some  of  required  microbial  adaptation  to  the  increased  VLR.\nHowever,  this  is  probably  not  a  direct  consequence,  but  a  result  of  the  increased\nSLR. On day 7 and day 10, the SLR was of 1.13 g COD.g VSS-1.d-1 and 1.33 g COD.g\nVSS-1.d-1 respectively. This high SLR seemed to have caused metabolic inhibition\nthus  slowing  down  growth  and  PHB  accumulation.  This  would  explain  the\ndecrease in VSS as a result of the dilution rate.\n\nThe  observed  yields  seemed  to  support  this  idea,  as  they  seem  to  vary  in  a\nopposite way regarding the SLR. This was already verified in the literature where\nhigher loading rates, result in smaller yields [7]. During the time of the experiment\nthe minimal VSS yield value was of 0.01 g VSS/g COD, on day 1 for a SLR of 2.26 g\nCOD.g VSS-1.d-1,  but  this  was  before  the  loading  rates  where  in  fact  regulated  for\nthe initial concentration of biomass. After this was carried out, the minimum VSS\nyield  was  0.09  g  VSS/  g  COD  (day  10,  1.33  g  COD.g  VSS-1.d-1)  and  the  maximum\nVSS yield was 0.36 g VSS/ g COD (day 9, 0.91 g COD.g VSS-1.d-1).

This observed VSS yield value falls short of\nthe  yield  value  of  0.43  g  VSS/g  COD,  using  fermented  olive  oil  mill  effluents  as\nfeedstock [25].\n\nPHB was not quantified during this time. PHB quantification as SLB revealed\nto be inaccurate and an alternative method was still being developed (Chapter 7).\nSo, to have a notion of how much carbon source was being used for growth or for\nthe production of PHB, non-PHA cellular biomass (NPCB) growth was quantified\nstoichiometrically considering a chemical composition of C7H12O4N [3].\n\nOn day 13 a concentration of 2240 mg N/L as total soluble nitrogen was\nverified  on  the  reactor,  revealing  that  nitrogen  was  pilling  up.  Influent  without  a\nnitrogen source was used in the next 6 cycles and it was possible to observe that,\nregarding the consumption of nitrogen, approximately almost all carbon source\nhad been converted to NPCB by the end of each cycle. This reveals that if PHB was\nbeen produced during feast, than it was being successfully used for growth during\nfamine. On day 17, the concentration of nitrogen in the reactor by the end of\nfamine  was  0  g  N/L,  so  it  was  possible  to  observe  this  in  more  detail  in  the  next\ncycle. After the initial feed pulse, nitrogen was almost completely consumed after\n90  minutes,  while  there  was  still  1044  mg  acetate/L  in  the  medium,  tanking\nanother 60 minutes to being consumed. This carbon source was most likely mainly\nconverted into PHB. On the overall, during this cycle 43 % of the carbon source fed\nseemed to have been directed towards the production of NPCB, while the\nremaining 57% was used for cellular maintenance and the production of PHB.\n\n5.2.1.2 A - Accumulation reactors\n\nNo accumulation tests were carried out with the sludge of the growth reactor\nA, due to limitation in the available material, as most of it was being used for the\nrun of tests in parallel in others Avecom's R&amp;D projects.\n\n\n\n56\n\n5.2.2 PHB production B\n\n5.2.2.1 B - Growth reactor\n\nGrowth reactor B had similar operation conditions to those of growth reactor\nA. However, in this case nutrient excess conditions were imposed, by increasing\nthe  N/COD  ratio.   This  was  expected  to  act  as  a  selective  pressure  in  order  to\nenhance growth and to select for bacteria capable of produce PHB efficiently, in a\naccumulation reactor, even in the presence of nutrients [7].\n\n The  reactor  was  maintained  over  a  period   of  31  days,  after  which  it  was\nstopped. The evolution of the biomass concentration in the reactor can be\nobserved in Figure 12.\n\nThe concentration of TSS and VSS decreased considerably from 17.28 g VSS/L\non  day  0  to  5.16  g  VSS/L  on  day  15.  It  was  expected  that  the  biomass  recovered\nfrom growth reactor A would be dead and so it would be washed away with time.\nThus, its concentration should be meaningless after day 5, as a result of the SRT of\n4.33 days. Nevertheless, VSS continued to decrease at a similar rate even after this\npoint.  It  was  not  predicted  that  the  applied  parameters  would  result  in  wash\nconditions, since a similar SRT had been used in growth reactor A. Hence, it was\nexpected that the biomass concentration in the reactor would eventually stabilize,\nwhen the VSS concentration reached normal value for this type of systems.\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nBi\nom\n\nas\ns(\n\ng/\nL)\n\nTime (d)\n\nTSS VSS\n\nFigure 12 \u2013 TSS and VSS in the growth reactor over a period of 31 days\n\n\n\n57\n\nOn  day  7  and  14  the  biomass  was  recovered  from  the  withdrawn  mixed\nliquor by centrifugation and reinocculated back again in the growth reactor. These\nwere attempts to maintain high cellular concentrations in the reactor. Yet, they\nproven to be useless as the biomass continued to decrease.\n\nThe  VLR  was  regulated  along  the  time  in  order  to  approach  the  SLR  of\nvalues close to 1 g COD.g VSS-1.d-1. Their evolution during the experiment, as well\nas the yields, can be observed in Figure 13. The low SLR form day 0 to day 3 could\nhelp  explain  the  decrease  in  biomass.  Nevertheless,  after  this  day  the  SLR  value\nwas high enough, so it was possible to prevent the biomass concentration from\ndecreasing,  which  only  happened  after  day  15.  Thus,  the  decrease  in  biomass\nconcentration appears to be caused by growth inhibition due to a limitation in\noxygen, since the reactor was inoculated with a high concentration of biomass an\nhigh loading rates were applied. In fact, during this period, a DO of 0 mg O2/L was\nmeasured during the entire time of feast. In oxygen-limiting conditions, the carbon\nsource is diverted from the TCA cycle to other metabolic pathways, like those\nleading to the production of PHB, as described in Chapter 2.5.\n\nNevertheless, this might have had other consequences as unidentified white\nlayer started to appear on the samples on day 9. Unlike the cells, this layer did not\nsediment  when  centrifuged  for  10  minutes  at  3,000  rpm.  Nutrient  analysis  ere\ncarried and it was verified that the total soluble nitrogen in the reactor was above\n2 g N/L.

The  white  layer  may  be  in  fact  exopolymer\nproduced  by  bacteria  as  a  stress  mechanism,  in  order  to  protect  them  from  this\nhigh concentrations of ammonium and other nitrogen compounds. This\nexopolymer most likely required a carbon substrate to synthesize and thus it may\nhave hindered the capacity of the reactor to select for PHB-producing bacteria.\n\nSeveral  measures  were  taken  in  order  to  correct  this  situation.  Firstly  the\nCOD  concentration  in  the  influent  was  reduced  from  40  g  COD/L  to  25  g  COD/L\nwithout neither a nitrogen nor a phosphorus source. This would diminish the\nconcentration of phosphorus and nitrogen on the reactor, while the lower VLR\nwould require a lower amount of oxygen for the acetate to be consumed.\nFurthermore,  it  was  verified  on  that  day  that  the  feed  with  40  g  COD/L  was\ntanking  already  taken  3h30  to  be  consumed.  On  day  11  the  influent  volume  fed\nper cycle was split into 2 equal feed pulses instead of a only one. This way a lower\namount  of  COD  was  fed  per  pulse,  resulting  in  lower  concentration  of  acetate  in\nthe medium, and requiring less oxygen for that given time.\n\nThe number of feed pulses was rearranged again on day 15, dividing the feed\nvolume in 3 equal feed pulses, which reduced the feast phase for less than 2 hours.\nThus,  it  was  possible  to  gradually  increase  the  loading  rates  over  the  next  days.\nThis  was  followed  for  an  increase  in  the  concentration  of  biomass  from  3.79  g\nVSS/L  on  day  15  to  6.26  g  VSS/L  on  day  18.  This  concentration  was  more  or  less\nmaintained  till  day  23  (6.00  g  VSS/L),  decreasing  almost  linearly  afterwards  till  a\nbiomass concentration of 2.26 g VSS/L was achieved on day 28. During the period\nwhere the biomass concentration was relatively stable, the average observed yield\nwas  of  0.23  g  VSS/g  COD  which  is  similar  value  to  that  observed  for  growth\nreactor. Nevertheless, during the phase where the concentration of VSS increased,\nthis yield rises to an average value of 0.39 g VSS/g COD which is close to the yield\nvalue  of  0.43  g  VSS/g  COD,  using  fermented  olive  oil  mill  effluents  as  feedstock,\nfound in the literature [25].\n\nOn  day  28  the  biomass  was  recovered  from  the  mixed  liquor  by\ncentrifugation at 3.000 rpm for 10 minutes and re-incubated in the reactor with 2 L\nof  fresh  activated  sludge.  This  was  carried  out  in  order  to  increase  the  biomass\nconcentration and basically do a reset in the selection process for PHB-producing\nbacteria.  A  decrease  in  VSS  was  observed  in  the  next  few  days,  but  it  was  not\npossible to verify if it would stabilize after sometime or duplicate the previous\nbehaviour, as the reactor overflowed on day 31.\n\n\n\n59\n\n5.2.2.2 B - Accumulation reactors\n\nFive different accumulation tests were carried out in fed-batch reactors. This\ntime a time controlled feed pulse strategy was preferred over the pH-stat method.\nThis way it is possible to define the amount of carbon source fed and when should\nit be fed, allowing a tighter control of the accumulation reactors.\n\nThe  influents  used  were  composed  of  acetic  acid  /  sodium  acetate  and\nammonium chloride in a COD/N ratio of 100/1 in days 2, 7 and 10 and of 100/2 in\ndays 15 and 21 in order to test the capability of the sludge to accumulate PHB in\nthe presence of this nutrient.\n\nTable 8 - Batch accumulation test using acetic acid on day 2 of the growth reactor B\nParameter Unit\nTime h 0 22\nBiomass concentration\n- TSS g/L 21.62 25.32\n- VSS g/L 13.45 16.38\n- PHB g/L 0.27 1.08\n- NPCB g/L 13.18 15.3\nRatio\n- PHB/VSS % 2 7\n- PHB/TSS % 1 4\n- VSS/TSS % 62 65\nReactor Volume mL 400 500\nCOD Fed g - 7.69\nVLR g COD/(L.d) - 15.38\nSLR g COD/(g VSS.d) - 0.94\nTotal biomass\n- TSS g 8.65 12.66\n- VSS g 5.38 8.19\n- PHB g 0.11 0.54\n- NPCB g 5.27 7.65\nYield\n- VSS g VSS/g COD - 0.37\n- PHB g PHB/g COD - 0.06\nProductivity\n- rP g PHB/(L.h) - 0.04\n- qP g PHB/(g VSS.h) - 0.00\n\nThere was a significant increase in the VSS concentration, with a yield of 0.37\n\ng  VSS/g  COD.

The\n\ninitial  PHB  content  of  2%  (PHB/VSS)  was  quiet  low  for  a  sludge  sample  taken\n\n\n\n60\n\nfrom the growth reactor at the end of feast and its increase during the\n\naccumulation fed batch was meaningless.\n\nAs a result, another accumulation test was carried on day 7 and day 10.\n\nTable 9 - Batch accumulation test using acetic acid on day 7 of the growth reactor B\nParameter Unit\nTime h 0 22\nBiomass concentration\n- TSS g/L 14.79 14.76\n- VSS g/L 10.12 10.40\n- PHB g/L 0.72 0.96\n- NPCB g/L 9.40 9.44\nRatio\n- PHB/VSS % 7 9\n- PHB/TSS % 5 7\n- VSS/TSS % 68 70\nReactor Volume mL 500 600\nCOD Fed G - 4.94\nVLR g COD/(L.d) - 8.23\nSLR g COD/(g VSS.d) - 0.79\nTotal biomass\n- TSS g 7.40 8.88\n- VSS g 5.06 6.24\n- PHB g 0.36 0.58\n- NPCB g 4.70 5.66\nYield\n- VSS g VSS/g COD - 0.24\n- PHB g PHB/g COD - 0.04\nProductivity\n- rP g PHB/(L.h) - 0.02\n- qP g PHB/(g VSS.h) - 0.00\n\nTable 10 - Batch accumulation test using acetic acid on day 10 of the growth reactor B\nParameter Unit\nTime h 0 22\nBiomass concentration\n- TSS g/L 8.27 14.73\n- VSS g/L 6.75 9.95\n- PHB g/L 0.22 1.07\n- NPCB g/L 6.53 8.88\nRatio\n- PHB/VSS % 3 11\n- PHB/TSS % 3 7\n- VSS/TSS % 82 68\nReactor Volume mL 400 500\nCOD Fed g - 9.23\n\n\n\n61\n\nVLR g COD/(L.d) - 18.46\nSLR g COD/(g VSS.d) - 1.85\nTotal biomass\n- TSS g 3.31 7.37\n- VSS g 2.70 4.98\n- PHB g 0.09 0.54\n- NPCB g 2.61 4.44\nYield\n- VSS g VSS/g COD - 0.25\n- PHB g PHB/g COD - 0.05\nProductivity\n- rP g PHB/(L.h) - 0.04\n- qP g PHB/(g VSS.h) - 0.00\n\nThe results of these test were similar to the first one, with the VSS increasing\nconsiderably, but not as a result of PHB storage. In the accumulation test started\non day 10 it was possible to verify an increase in the \"white layer\" described in the\ngrowth reactor section. At that time the presumable exopolymer had not yet been\nassociated with the high concentrations of nitrogen in the medium. The\n\"exopolymer\" and its amount before and after the accumulation test can be\nverified on Figure 14.\n\nFigure 14 - Pellet of the mixed liquor sample of the growth reactor (left) and from the accumulation\nreactor (right) after centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for tem minutes.\n\n  This image shows that the increase of VSS is mostly due to the production\nof this \"exopolymer\". The results of the accumulation tests on days 15 and 21 were\nvery similar to the ones above, since the cause of this stress mechanism was not\ncorrected. The results of this accumulation tests can be verified on Appendix C.\n\n\n\n62\n\n5.2.3 PHB production C\n\n5.2.3.1 C - Growth reactor\n\nThe evolution of the biomass concentration in the growth reactor A can be\nobserved in Figure 15 while the VLR, SLR and biomass yield can be observed on\nFigure 16.\n\nFigure 15 - Evolution of the concentration of TSS and VSS over a period of 15 days.\n\nThe  reactor  was  inoculated  with  activated  sludge  having  a  biomass\nconcentration of 2.7 g VSS/L. This value increased linearly over the first two days\ntill a VSS concentration of 4.3 g/L on day 2. On day 1 it was verified that the feast\nphase was lasting  for 3h30 and so the volumetric loading rate was lowered from 6\ng COD.L-1.d-1 to 4.3 g COD.L-1.d-1.\n\nVFA  analysis  on  day  2  showed  that  the  concentration  of  acetic  acid  on  the\nmedium  at  the  end  of  each  feed  pulse  was  minimal,  allowing  the  increase  of  the\nVLR  to  6.3   g  COD.L-1.d-1 for  day  3.  This  resulted  in  a  decrease  in  the  biomass\nconcentration, to 3.1 g VSS/L. Nevertheless, the VFA analysis clearly showed that\nthe acetic acid was almost completely deployed at the end of each feed pulse. This\nbehaviour,  both  on  day  2  and  day,  3  indicated  that  the  acetate  uptake  rate  was\nbeing equal to the feeding rate. Therefore, if the decrease in the VSS concentration\non  day  3  was  caused  by  substrate  inhibition  in  the  first  two  cycles  of  the  day,  it\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16\n\nBi\nom\n\nas\ns\n\n(g\n/L\n\n)\n\nTime (d)\n\nTSS VSS\n\n\n\n63\n\nseemed that the microbial population managed to adapt to the imposed loading\nrates and the VLR was maintained.\n\nFigure 16 - Volumetric and sludge loading rates over a period of 15 days\n\nThere  was  a  significant  increase  in  VSS  from  day  3  to  7  with  the  biomass\nconcentration  almost  doubling,  from  3.1  g  VSS/L  to  6.0  g  VSS/L.  By  maintaining\nthe VLR it was possible to maintain a stable concentration of biomass in the\nreactor  till  day  13.  Hence,  stabilizing  the  SLR  between  1.05  and\n1.12 g COD.g VSS-1.d-1 and  the  yields  at  an  average  of  0.27  \u00b1  0.05  g  VSS/g  COD.\nThe uptake rates continued equal to the feed rate during this time.\n\nFrom  day  13  to  day  14  the  HRT  and  SRT  was  changed  from  3.5  to  3.0  days,\nby increasing the volume of influent fed to reactor and consequently withdrawn\nfrom in, for 1.2 L to 1.5.  No alterations were made to the influent concentration as\nso,  as  a  result,  this  led  to  an  increase  in  the  VLR  to  7.3  g  COD.L-1.d-1.  It  was\nexpected that by reducing the HRT and SRT growth would be estimulated, but the\nopposite happened. All this together led to a significant decrease in the biomass\nconcentration, reaching a minimum value of 2.50 g VSS/L on the last day.\n\n5.2.3.2 C - Accumulation reactors\n\nThe  accumulation  tests  started  on  day  7,  8  and  9  used  and  influent  with  a\nCOD/N/P ratio of 100/1/0 similar to the accumulation tests performed on growth\n\n0.00\n\n0.50\n\n1.00\n\n1.50\n\n2.00\n\n2.50\n\n3.00\n\n3.50\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n5.0\n\n6.0\n\n7.0\n\n8.0\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16\n\nSL\nR\n\n(g\nC\n\nO\nD\n\n.g\nV\n\nSS\n-1\n\n.d\n-1\n\n)\nY\n\nie\nld\n\n(g\nV\n\nSS\n.g\n\nC\nO\n\nD\n-1\n\n)\n\nV\nLR\n\n(g\nC\n\nO\nD\n\n.L\n-1\n\n.d\n-1\n\n)\n\nTime (d)\n\nVLR SLR Yield\n\n\n\n64\n\nreactor. However, in this case there was not production of the \"exopolymer\" in the\ngrowth reactor and the concentration of nitrogen in the medium was more\ncontrolled. The importance of these tests was to assess the influence of a nitrogen\nsource  in  the  accumulation  of  PHB.  Some  articles  state  that  presence  of  a  small\nconcentration of nitrogen, for example in a COD/N ratio of 100/1 enhances the\nproduction  of  PHB  in  pure  cultures  of Cupriavidus necator. This happened as\nnitrogen is required for the enzimes responsible for the polymerization of PHB [92].\nSince mixed microbial cultures produce PHB mainly by an internal limitation\nmechanism [7], this should not compromise the results.\n\nTable 11 - Batch accumulation test using acetic acid on day 7 of the growth reactor C - feed pulse\nParameter Unit\nTime h 0 22\nBiomass concentration\n- TSS g/L 5.07 5.08\n- VSS g/L 4.31 4.67\n- PHB g/L 0.32 1.32\n- NPCB g/L 3.99 3.35\nRatio\n- PHB/VSS % 7 28\n- PHB/TSS % 6 26\n- VSS/TSS % 85 92\nReactor Volume mL 1000 1355\nCOD Fed g - 20.2\nVLR g COD/(L.d) - 14.90\nSLR g COD/(g VSS.d) - 3.19\nTotal biomass\n- TSS g 5.07 6.88\n- VSS g 4.31 6.33\n- PHB g 0.32 1.79\n- NPCB g 3.99 4.54\nYield\n- VSS g VSS/g COD - 0.10\n- PHB g PHB/g COD - 0.07\nProductivity\n- rP g PHB/(L.h) - 0.05\n- qP g PHB/(g VSS.h) - 0.01\n\nThe accumulation test was started with the biomass having a PHB content of\n7 % (g PHB/g PHB) which is quiet low having into account the sludge was at the\nend  of  feast.  This  value  increased  to  28  %  (g  PHB/  g  VSS)  after  22  hours  of\naccumulation which is a rather low value for a microbial population acclimated to\nADF conditions. Both the yields and the productivity rates were also considerably\n\n\n\n65\n\nlow.  Another  test  was  run  in  the  next  day  exhibiting  a  similar  behaviour,  with\neven lower results Appendix C.\n\nA final test still using an influent with a COD/N ratio of 100/1 was ran on day\n9 (Table 12).\n\nTable 12 - Batch accumulation test using acetic acid on day 9 of the growth reactor C - feed pulse\nParameter Unit\nTime h 0 22\nBiomass concentration\n- TSS g/L 6.50 9.40\n- VSS g/L 5.50 8.46\n- PHB g/L 0.37 1.20\n- NPCB g/L 5.13 7.26\nRatio\n- PHB/VSS % 7 14\n- PHB/TSS % 6 13\n- VSS/TSS % 85 90\nReactor Volume mL 1000 1360\nCOD Fed g - 21.6\nVLR g COD/(L.d) - 15.88\nSLR g COD/(g VSS.d) - 1.88\nTotal biomass\n- TSS g 6.50 12.78\n- VSS g 5.50 11.51\n- PHB g 0.37 1.63\n- NPCB g 5.13 9.87\nYield\n- VSS g VSS/g COD - 0.28\n- PHB g PHB/g COD - 0.06\nProductivity\n- rP g PHB/(L.h) - 0.04\n- qP g PHB/(g VSS.h) - 0.01\n\nThe  biggest  difference  in  this  test  was  the  high  VSS  yield.  Nevertheless,  the\nproduction of \"exopolymer\" was not verified in any of these accumulation tests.\nThe increase in VSS on this last test seemed to be a consequence of cellular growth,\nsince nitrogen was consumed in a stoichiometric proportion.\n\nThese reveals that the selected microbial population has little tolerance for\nthe production of PHB under nutrient excess conditions. This is may be caused by\nthe  short  SRT,  that  may  act  as  a  strong  selective  pressure  to  growth,  instead  of  a\nPHB accumulation. This may result in a big handicap in a industrial process using\ncomplex fermented stream, where there may be abundance of nutrients and short\nSRT are desired.\n\n\n\n66\n\nDue to this observation, on the following fill ups no nitrogen source was\nused on the influent, having acetic acid/acetate as the only nutrient. Two feeding\nstrategies  were  applied  during  the  several  fill  ups  in  order  to  compare  their\nresults. The first one was pH-stat method that was used to run a accumulation test\non  day  13  and  other  on  day  14,  where  the  influent  was  fed  automatically  to  the\nreactor, every time the pH exceeded 8.2. This value was chosen as it was reported\nthat  the  use  of  pH-stat  at  higher  pH  values  resulted  in  a  high  PHB  content [93].\nWhile the other strategy consisted of time controlled feed pulse feeding, where the\nreactor was fed every 72 minutes (20 times per day) for 3 minutes, with a influent\nflow rate of 6.66 mL.\n\nThe results of the accumulation test using the pH-stat method on day 13  are\npresent on Table 13.\n\nTable 13 - Batch accumulation test using acetic acid on day 13 of the growth reactor C - pH stat\nstrategy\nParameter Unit\nTime h 0 22\nBiomass concentration\n- TSS g/L 6.4 4.07\n- VSS g/L 5.5 3.70\n- PHB g/L 0.40 0.97\n- NPCB g/L 5.10 2.73\nRatio\n- PHB/VSS % 7 26\n- PHB/TSS % 6 24\n- VSS/TSS % 86 91\nReactor Volume mL 1200 1300\nCOD Fed g - 6\nVLR g COD/(L.d) - 4.62\nSLR g COD/(g VSS.d) - 1.25\nTotal biomass\n- TSS g 7.68 5.29\n- VSS g 6.60 4.81\n- PHB g 0.48 1.26\n- NPCB g 6.12 3.55\nYield\n- VSS g VSS/g COD - 0.00\n- PHB g PHB/g COD - 0.13\nProductivity\n- rP g PHB/(L.h) - 0.03\n- qP g PHB/(g VSS.h) - 0.01\n\nThere  was  not  a  significant  production  of  PHB  nor  a  significant  increase  in\nthe  PHB  content.  This  may  be  a  consequence  of  the  low  VLR,  since  there  was  a\n\n\n\n67\n\ndecrease in the total VSS, which may indicate cellular starvation, although the SLR\nwas of 1.25 g COD.g VSS-1.d-1.  This is one problem of this method, as the COD fed\nto the system cannot be imposed. As a result it may take a lot of time for the pH to\nreach the value where more influent will be added, as this is influenced by the pH\nof the influent and the buffer capacity of the reactor's medium.\n\nBecause of this on day 9, to fill ups were started in order to compare the feed\npulse  strategy  with  the  ph-stat.  In  this  day,  the  pH  of  the  influent  for  the  feed\npulse strategy was set to 5.5, while for the pH-stat the influent was set at pH 5.0.\n\nTable 14 - Batch accumulation test using acetic acid on day 14 of the growth reactor C - feed pulse\nstrategy\nParameter Unit\nTime h 0 22\nBiomass concentration\n- TSS g/L 5.73 4.92\n- VSS g/L 4.91 4.73\n- PHB g/L 0.17 1.87\n- NPCB g/L 4.74 2.86\nRatio\n- PHB/VSS % 3 40\n- PHB/TSS % 3 38\n- VSS/TSS % 86 96\nReactor Volume mL 600 1010\nCOD Fed g - 24.6\nVLR g COD/(L.d) - 24.36\nSLR g COD/(g VSS.d) - 5.15\nTotal biomass\n- TSS g 3.44 4.97\n- VSS g 2.95 4.78\n- PHB g 0.10 1.89\n- NPCB g 2.844 2.89\nYield\n- VSS g VSS/g COD - 0.07\n- PHB g PHB/g COD - 0.07\nProductivity\n- rP g PHB/(L.h) - 0.08\n- qP g PHB/(g VSS.h) - 0.03\n\nTable 15 - Batch accumulation test using acetic acid on day 14 of the growth reactor C - pH stat\nstrategy\nParameter Unit\nTime h 0 22\nBiomass concentration\n- TSS g/L 5.73 6.18\n- VSS g/L 4.91 5.99\n- PHB g/L 0.17 2.27\n\n\n\n68\n\n- NPCB g/L 4.74 3.72\nRatio\n- PHB/VSS % 3 38\n- PHB/TSS % 3 37\n- VSS/TSS % 86 97\nReactor Volume mL 600 975\nCOD Fed g - 22.5\nVLR g COD/(L.d) - 23.08\nSLR g COD/(g VSS.d) - 3.85\nTotal biomass\n- TSS g 3.44 6.03\n- VSS g 2.95 5.84\n- PHB g 0.10 2.21\n- NPCB g 2.84 3.63\nYield\n- VSS g VSS/g COD - 0.13\n- PHB g PHB/g COD - 0.09\nProductivity\n- rP g PHB/(L.h) - 0.10\n- qP g PHB/(g VSS.h) - 0.03\n\nIt is possible to observe that both methods exhibited similar results and\nvery  decent  PHB  contents  were  achieved.  This  proves  that  the  pH  of  the  fresh\ninfluent may have a tremendous impact on the performance of the accumulation\nreactor if a pH-stat strategy is used. Nevertheless, both accumulation tests\nrevealed low yields and low productivity rates. This means that a lower amount of\nCOD could have been used to feed the reactors and probably in a shorter fed batch\nrun.\n\n\n\n69\n\n6 Production of PHB enriched SCP\n\n6.1 Background\n\n Single cell protein (SCP) is the use of microorganisms as a feed/food source\nof  protein.  This  concept  started  to  become  popular  in  the  60s  and  70s.  However,\nchanges in the economical landscape and mainly the resistance of the public to the\nproduct led to a significant decrease in the development and investments related\nto this technology.\n\n Nowadays, there is a renewed interest in the production of microbial\nprotein.  SCP  can  be  produced  in  a  economical  feasible  way,  by  using  waste\nmaterials  as  substrates.  This  can  be  used  in  animal  feed  or  even  in  products  for\nhuman consumption [94].  This way, costly conventional protein sources like soy- or\nfishmeal  can  be  replaced  as  protein  supplements.  The  use  of  waste  as  a  negative\ncost substrate  also benefits the economy of the process [95].\n\n PHB  enriched  mixed  cultures  could  be  used  as  a  protein  source.  This  may\nseen contradictory, since the PHB is considered a lipid [4] and  would  therefore\ndecrease the value of the biomass [96].  However,  PHB  has  been  proven  to  have  a\nhighly positive influence on the gastrointestinal health [97-99].\n\n There are bacteria present in the intestine that can efficiently degrade PHB\ninto butyrate [97, 98]. This can be effectively absorbed by the intestinal bacteria or by\nthe  host  to  be  used  as  carbon  source  in  their  metabolism [98]. Studies performed\nwith  juvenile  European  seabass  showed  that  partially  feeding  them  with  PHB\nenhances their growth [99]. Furthermore, other studies reveal that these compounds\nand the enriched intestinal bacterial community result in an increased resistance\noff the host to pathogenic agents [97, 98]. These factors are considerably relevant for\nthe industry of aquaculture as it allows better productivities and to minimize the\nuse of antibiotics for the control of diseases.\n\n Given those reasons, it was considered of economical interest to develop a\nmethod to produce PHB enriched SCP for being used as fish feed.\n\n\n\n70\n\n6.2 Results and discussion\n\nA  method  for  the  quick  production  of  a  large  quantity  of  PHB  enriched\nsingle cell protein was necessary in order to produce enough fish feed so it could\nbe used in zootechnical trials. For that, it was defined that the PHB content should\nbe at least 20 % of the VSS.\n\nIt was demonstrated in the literature that unacclimated activated sludge\nfrom  WWTPs  operated  in  SBR  could  store  PHA  if  submitted  to  feed  pulses  of\norganic acids, even without previous selection [100].  This  way  it  is  not  possible  to\nachieve high PHB contents, which would endear significantly the downstream\nprocess if a pure product was desired, but allows high concentrations of biomass\nslightly increased in PHB. This process was therefore considered suitable for the\ndesired goal, as it consisted in a simple way of producing PHB enriched single cell\nprotein.\n\nThe results of a first fed-batch test are presented in Table 6.\n\nTable 16 - Excessive feeding, fed-batch number 1\nParameter Unit 0 h 22 h Delta\nReactor volume mL 6000 7650 1650\nBiomass\n-TSS g/L 14.03 13.22 -0.81\n-VSS g/L 8.91 8.84 -0.07\n-PHB g/L 1.27 1.88 +0.61\nRatio\n-VSS/TSS % 63 67 +4\n-PHB/TSS % 9 14 +5\n-PHB/VSS % 14 21 +7\nAcetic acid fed g 99.0\nAcetic acid consumed g 45.3\nTotal biomass in the\nsystem\n-g TSS g 84.2 101.1 +16.9\n-g VSS g 53.5 67.6 +14.1\n-g PHB g 7.7 14.4 +6.7\nYield (COD fed)\n-TSS/COD g/g - 0.17 -\n-VSS/COD g/g - 0.14 -\n\n\n\n71\n\n-PHB/COD g/g - 0.07 -\nYield (COD consumed)\n-TSS/COD g/g - 0.37 -\n-VSS/COD g/g - 0.31 -\n-PHB/COD g/g - 0.15 -\n\nThere  was  an  increase  in  the  PHB  content  from  14  %  to  21  %  (PHB/VSS)\nwhich  fulfills  the  main  objective.  This  is  value  considerably  lower  than  the  PHB\ncontents  achieved  with  acclimated  sludge,  that  can  represent  50  %  of  the  VSS  or\neven higher. Nevertheless, this method allows that high biomass concentrations\nare  easily  obtained,  which  is  not  the  case  when  activated  sludge  is  submitted  do\nADF  conditions,  were  a  stable  reactor  operation  is  hard  to  maintain  for  high  VSS\nvalues.  On  the  other  hand,  this  process  has  the  disadvantage  of  having  a  low\nVSS/TSS  ratio,  while  in  the  selection  reactor  this  could  easily  achieve  a  value  of\n0.85. This high ash content (the difference between TSS and VSS) can be a barrier\nto the commercialization of this product as feed, both in terms of legislation and\nquality control.\n\n The  observed yield of 0.15 g PHB/g COD consumed is below the ones found\nin  the  literatures  for  the  production  of  PHB  by  unacclimated  activated  sludge\nusing  volatile  fatty  acids,  that  range  from  0.20  g  PHB/  g  COD  to  0.28  g  PHB  /  g\nCOD.  However,  around  50  %  of  the  acetic  acid/acetate  fed  was  not  consumed.\nExcessive  feeding  of  a  carbon  source  was  already  discussed  in  the  previous\nchapters as having a negative effect on the yields and even leading to inhibition of\nmetabolic  pathways.  Therefore,  it  is  rather  probable  that  this  could  be  increased\nwith a better optimization of the process.\n\n\n\n72\n\n7 Development of a new method for PHB\nquantification\n\n7.1 Background\n\nThe thermal instability of PHB during melt is a considerable drawback for its\nuse as substitute to nonbiodegradable polymeric materials in commercial products\n[101].  PHB  starts  to  degrade  and  volatilize  at  temperatures  above  200  \u00b0C  and  more\nsignificantly after 230 \u00b0C [101, 102].\n\nThe procedure initially used at Avecom for the determination of the PHB\ncontent in the biomass  was based in this characteristic. Dried biomass samples, in\nwhich the TSS was already determined, were submitted to a temperature of 250 \u00b0C\nfor 2 hours in an incinerator. It was considered that this was sufficient to volatilize\nall PHB in the samples and that the weight loss was mainly due to this. This was a\nquick, practical and economic method to estimate the PHB content of the activated\nsludge  samples.   Nevertheless,  this  method  was  never  carefully  validated  and\nwith time it was possible to observe a huge standard deviation between replicas\n(results not shown). Different incineration times were tried in order to refine the\nmethod, but the increased reproducibility was followed by an increased\ninaccuracy of the determination, most likely due to the volatilization of the NPCB.\nTherefore, there was the need to implement another PHB quantification protocol\nat Avecom.\n\nThe quantification of PHB is a challenging procedure, since it is hampered by\nthe complexity of the matrix and the relatively low content of the polymer,\nespecially in activated sludge [103].  Currently,  it  is  possible  to  quantify  PHB  by\nNMR [104, 105], mass-spectometry [106] or, more commonly, by  gas chromatography [96,\n107, 108].\n\nThe GC quantification is based on the acidic transesterification of PHB in the\npresence of a chlorinated solvent (simultaneous extraction and derivatization)\nfollowed  by  the  analysis  of  the  hydroxybutyrate  alkyl-ester  by  GC [96, 107, 108]. The\nmost common differences in this method are regarding the solvent used\n(chloroform, dichloroethane or dichloromethane), the transesterification alcohol\n(methanol or propanol) or in the reaction catalyst (sulfuric acid or HCl).\n\nAlthough the high sensitivity and reproducibility of the method [109], its\ndrawbacks meant a technically difficult  implementation at Avecom. The method\n\n\n\n73\n\nis lengthy and requires the handling and disposal of harmful and highly pollutant\nsolvents [103].  Furthermore,  in  some  variations  of  the  method  PHB  recovery  is\ninefficient  in  the  presence  of  water,  while  the  acids  and  cellular  debris  in  the\nsample  cause  premature  GC  column  degradation.  This  can  be  avoided,  but  only\nby introducing sample lyophilisation and an additional purification step to the\nmethod [107], which increases the cost and complexity of the method.\n\nOther quantification methods relying on HPLC or flow cytometry was not\npossible due to the lack of the required devices. Because of this there was a need to\ndevelop a quantification method to be used at Avecom. This method should be\nrelatively cheap, not recur to chlorinated or other high pollutant solvents and\npreferably allow the  quantification of PHB without its destruction.\n\nThe development of a method based on the extraction of PHB by propylene\ncarbonate, fitted these three conditions. Unlike the chlorinate hydrocarbons, 1,2-\npropylene carbonate presents a low toxicity and a high boiling point (240 \u00baC). This\nway,  it  has  a  low  vapor  pressure  at  environmental  temperatures  and  its\nevaporation  to  the  environment  is  avoided.  PHB  is  soluble  in  1,2-propylene\ncarbonate at temperatures higher than 100 \u00b0C even for short contact times,\nallowing its separation from the biomass. After this step, methanol or ethanol\ncould be used in order to precipitate the dissolved PHB , that could then be\nrecovered by filtration or centrifugation. The methanol or ethanol could be easily\nrecovered  afterwards  by  distillation,  give  the  different  boiling  points.   A  PHA\nrecover  yield  of  95%  and  a  purity  of  84%  was  reported  for  the  extraction  from\nCupriavidus necator cells, without any pre-treatment. The extraction procedure was\ncarried out at 130 \u00baC for 30 min [76, 77]. These results are comparable to the values\nobtained from chloroform extraction (94% yield and 98% purity) [9].\n\n7.2 Results and discussion\n\nThe values of PHB quantificaiton by chloroform extraction and 1,2-propylene\ncarbonate  (PC)  for  two  different  samples  and  different  replicas  are  compared  in\nTable 17.\n\n\n\n74\n\nTable 17 - Comparison between the amount of PHA obtained wiht chloroform and propylene carbonate\nextraction\n\nPHB\nEnriched\nSludge\n\nSample volume (mL)\nPolyhydroxyalkanoates (g/L)\n\nChlorofom extraction PC extraction\n\n20\n4.71\n\n(\u00b10.27)\n6.50\n\n(\u00b10.34)\n\n10\n5.82\n\n(\u00b11.66)\n6.66\n\n(\u00b10.49)\n\nAverage\n5.27\n\n(\u00b11.17)\n6.58\n\n(\u00b10.36)\n\nActivated\nSludge\n\nSample volume (mL)\nPolyhydroxyalkanoates (g/L)\n\nChlorofom extraction PC extraction\n\n20\n0.53\n\n(\u00b10.10)\n0.08\n\n(\u00b10.01)\n\n10\n0.53\n\n(\u00b10.16)\n0.14*\n\nAverage\n0.53\n\n(\u00b10.11)\n0.10\n\n(\u00b10.04)\n*Only one sample taken into account\n\nThese values were then converted to PHA content as part of TSS and as part of\nVSS and were compared with the values obtained by SLB quantification.\n\nTable 18 - Comparison between the PHA/TSS and PHA/VSS ratios determined by chloroform and\npropylene carbonate extraction and by thermogravimetric analysis of SLB\n\nRatio Chloroform Propylene Carbonate SLB\n\nPHB\nEnriched\nSludge\n\nPHA/TSS\n(\u00b1 )\n\n28 %\n35 %\n(+7%)\n\n50 %\n(+ 22%)\n\nPHA/VSS\n(\u00b1 )\n\n36 %\n45 %\n\n(+ 9%)\n64 %\n\n(+ 28%)\n\nActivated\nsludge\n\nPHA/TSS\n(\u00b1 )\n\n2,2 %\n0,4 %\n\n(-1.8 %)\n26 %\n\n(+24 %)\nPHA/VSS\n\n(\u00b1 )\n5,2 %\n\n1.0 %\n(-4,2 %)\n\n59 %\n(+54 %)\n\nChlorofom extraction is currently used as a standard method for PHA\nrecovery in lab scale, so the values obtained with it were used as reference.\n\nIt is possible to verify in table 1 and 2 that the propylene carbonate extraction\nallowed  to  obtain  a  higher  amount  of  PHA  form  the  pilot  fill  up  sludge  than  the\n\n\n\n75\n\nones with chloroform. Furthermore, the method does not decrease its sensibility\nand  reproducibility  when  different  volumes  of  sample  are  used.  Finally,  but  not\nleast, the methanol used in this method allows the removal of other oils from the\nextracted  PHA,  so  a  higher  purity  is  expected.  This  seems  to  be  proven  by  the\nvalues  obtained  from  the  brewery  sludge,  where  more  biomass  was  extracted  is\nchloroform.\n\n\n\n76\n\n8 Conclusions\n\nThe use of mixed microbial cultures for the production of PHB in reactors\noperated in ADF conditions was possible. However, relatively low biomass\nconcentrations were achieved, even when it was possible to obtain values higher\nthan the ones found in the literature.\n\nThe low biomass concentration is a limitation of the ADF conditions, since\nthe  loading  rates  are  limited  by  the  need  of  a  famine  phase.  Excessively  high\nloading rates seemed to have a negative impact on the performance of the reactor\ninhibiting growth and the production of PHB. This is clearly the main limitation\nregarding  this  type  of  system,  for  its  appliance  at  an  industrial  scale.  It  was\npossible to achieve better values using the Hydrocell system than by conventional\nADF conditions. However, the increased operation costs might not overcome the\nadvantages.\n\nThe  control  of  the  feed  by  the  levels  of  DO  may  play  a  key  role  in  the\ndevelopment of new feeding patterns and in the control of this type of systems at\nan industrial scale.\n\nThe  problems  regarding  the  production  of  PHB  under  nitrogen  excess\nconditions revealed that this process cannot be used with any type of wastewaters.\nAs a result, their carefully selection must be carried out before the implementation\nof a full scale process.\n\n8.1 Hydrocell\n\nA unusual high biomass concentration for mixed microbial cultures\nsubmitted to ADF conditions was achieved. Furthermore, the biomass\nconcentration of the reactor was stable during the time of the experiment, without\nmajor fluctuations in VSS, although the unstable HRT, SRT, VLR and SLR applied.\n\nThe  specific  growth  rate  of  0.09  h-1,  the  maximum  one  observed  in  the\nHydrocell's  growth  reactor,  is  in  range  with  the  data  found  in  the  literature.  The\nmaximum  observed  VSS  yield  was  of  0.49  g  VSS/g  COD  which  was  a  very  good\nresult, although the average VSS yield was only of 0.28 g VSS/COD.\n\nA  good  capability  to  store  PHB  using  acetic  acid  as  a  carbon  source  was\nobserved,  with  a  maximum  PHB  content  of  59  %  of  the  VSS.  Although  the  low\nproductivity  rates,  this  was  achieved  with  PHB  production  yield  of  0.30  g  SLB/g\n\n\n\n77\n\nCOD which was a very acceptable value. On the other hand, it was not possible to\nsignificantly produce PHB under autotrophic conditions on the accumulation\ntests.\n\n8.2 Production of PHB by ADF\n\nThe  growth  reactors  on  this  system  were  less  stable  than  the  one  in  the\nHydrocell system, as the microbial population tended to decay with time..\nNevertheless  it  was  possible  to  achieve  a  stable  growth  reactor  during  PHB\nproduction C, while stable conditions were imposed. This sensibility to the change\nof conditions may due to the different system used, to the different source of\nactivated sludge or to both.\n\nThe biomass concentration of the growth reactor was similar to the values\nfound on the literature. In fact, the concentration of biomass in growth reactor A\nwas higher than the usual values, but the capability of microbial population to\naccumulate  PHB  was  not  verified.  The  maximum  observed  VSS  yields  were  in\nrange with the literature.\n\nHigh biomass concentrations are technically difficult to obtain or to apply in\ngrowth reactors operated in ADF conditions, due to the limitations in the loading\nrates  that  can  be  applied.  VLR  must  be  regulated  regarding  the  capability  to\nprovide oxygen to the medium, as a limitation in O2 result in lower uptake rates\nand in an increased feast phase. While the SLR must be high enough to maintain\nthe concentration of biomass in the reactor, while higher values may inhibit\ngrowth and PHB production. A SLR value close to 1 g COD.g VSS-1. d-1 seemed to\nbe appropriated for the growth reactor. The observed VSS yield usually decrease\nwhen the SLR is increased, while they to increase when the SLR is decreased.\n\nIt is possible to increase the loading rates by splitting the feed volume\nthrough  several  feed  pulses  during  feast  phase,  instead  of  a  single  one  at  the\nbeginning of feast. This results in the decrease of the amount of COD present in\nthe reactor at a given moment, thus requiring less oxygen to incorporate it. This\ncan be controlled by measuring the levels of DO in the reactor's medium.\n\nThe use of time controlled feed pulses during accumulation tests revealed to\nbe preferred over the pH-stat method, as it allows a direct control of the reactor\nand the imposition of defined conditions. On the other hand, the pH-stat method\nefficiency seemed to be highly influenced by the pH of the influent used, and most\nlikely by the buffer capability of the accumulation reactor's medium also.\n\n\n\n78\n\nThe presence of high amounts of ammonium seem to select for bacteria other\nthan PHB-producing ones or to activate a stress response where an exopolymer\nseemed to be produced. This stress mechanism most likely diverted the consumed\ncarbon source for other metabolic pathways rather than for PHB production\n\n8.3 Production of PHB enriched SCP\n\nIt was possible to produce PHB enriched SCP using non acclimated activated\nsludge,  by  feeding  a  relatively  high  biomass  concentration  with  acetic  acid.  This\nmay  constitute  a  simple  and  quick  method  to  originate  added  value  from\nwastewaters, as this PHB enriched biomass may have an interesting nutritional\nvalue.\n\n8.4 Development of a new method for PHB quantification\n\nA  method  for  the  quantification  of  PHB  using  1,2-propylene  carbonate  was\ndeveloped. This method was reproducibly and exhibited to be at least as accurate\nas the one using chloroform for the extraction of PHB from biomass, followed by\ngravimetric quantification.\n\n\n\n79\n\n9 Further work\n\nThe  economics  of  the  process  must  be  determined  in  order  to  see  if  this\nprocess  could  in  fact  present  advantages  over  the  anaerobic  treatment  and  in\nwhich circumstantiates. For this, distinct types of wastewater must be evaluate for\nthe production of PHB.\n\nIt is necessary to develop a strategy that can be applied in production of\nPHB, as the control and optimization of this type of systems can be highly\ndifficult. More studies focused on the use of DO in order to control the process\nmust be carried out in the future.\n\nNew applications for PHB must be searched, as it can be more useful in other\nareas rather than competing with other types of plastic. In these other areas the\nprice  of  PHB  or  PHB  enriched  sludge  may  be  an  advantage  rather  than  a\nlimitation.\n\nA stronger proof of concept regarding the Hydrocell system and the\nproduction of PHB enriched SCP must be developed in order for these systems to\nbecome economically atractive.\n\nThe  development  of  a  quicker  method  for  the  quantification  of  PHB  using\nnon chlorinated solvents, preferably by GG or HPLC would be of great interest.\n\n9.1 Hydrocell\n\nThe  obtained  results  should  be  confirmed  using  a  similar  system.  However,\nin that study thiourea should be used in order to avoid nitrification. This is\nnecessary, as nitrifying bacteria are autotrophic [64] and the high biomass\nconcentrations may result of that.\n\nThe characterization of the microbial population selected using this\nconditions would be of great interest in order to really understand the effect of\nhaving an electrolysis reactor coupled to the growth reactor and to confirm if\nhydrogen  gas  can  indeed  be  used  as  a  selective  pressure  for  PHB  production  by\nmixed cultures.\n\nSince  no  accumulation  tests  were  carried  out  after  day  10,  it  would  be\nimportant  to  verify  if  the  capacity  of  the  bacteria  to  accumulate  PHB  would  be\naffected by increasing the loading rates in the hydrocell's growth reactor.\n\n\n\n80\n\n9.2 Production of PHB by ADF\n\nTests using real wastewater efluents would be of great importance for the\nactivities of Avecom. This can change greatly in compositions and so a strategy for\nthe selection of PHB-producing bacteria capable of operate under different\nnutrient conditions would be desirable.\n\nIt is necessary to develop a strategy that can be applied in production of\nPHB, as the control and optimization of this type of systems can be highly\ndifficult. More studies focused on the use of DO in order to control the process\nmust be carried out in the future.\n\n9.3 Production of PHB enriched SCP\n\nThe  production  process  must  be  optimized,  in  order  to  achieve  yields  and\nproductivity rates. The downstream of the process also need to be developed so a\nstable, sterilized product can be delivered.\n\nThis  product  must  be  more  extensively  characterized  regarding  the  amount\nof protein and amino acid composition, the ribonucleic an deoxyribonucleic acids\ncontent, as well as carbohydrate and lipid content. Toxicity and contamination\ntests must be also carried out in order to access for the safety of this product.\n\nThe introduction of extra steps that could lead to the increase of the VSS/TSS\nratio, maintaining the process simples and allowing high biomass concentrations\nand yields would be highly desirable.\n\n9.4 Development of a new method for PHB quantification\n\nThe  method  should  be  further  validated,  as  the  use  of  other  sources  of\nactivated  sludge  or  the  presence  of  certain  nutrients  could  affect  the\nreproducibility and accuracy of the method. The results should also be compared\nto those of more widely accepted methods like the protocols used for\nquantification using GC or HPLC.\n\n\n\n81\n\nEconomical and feasibility studies regarding the use of 1,2-propylene\ncarbonate as a solvent for the extraction and purification of PHB at industrial scale\nshould  be  carried  out  in  order  to  verify  if  they  can  be  indeed  used  as  a  viable\nalternative to chlorinated solvents.\n\nThe  development  of  GC  or  HPLC  analysis  protocol  for  the  PHB\nquantification using 1,2-propylene carbonate, or other non-chlorinated solvent, in\nreplacement of the chlorinated solvents used nowadays on those protocols would\nbe very useful.\n\n\n\n82\n\nReferences\n\n1.

It quantification is usually a complicated process that requires highly\nacidic conditions and temperature in order to hydrolyze the polymer chain. After\nthat, the monomers are further derivate to a compound possible to quantify\nthrough gas or high pressure liquid chromatography.\n\nAlternatively,  PHB  can  be  extracted  and  purified  from  the  remaining\nbiomass. However, this polymer is not soluble in most solvents and its susceptible\nto hydrolysis, both on acid and alkaline conditions, makes its separation from the\ncellular debris a difficult task. Chlorinated solvents are commonly used in lab\nscale to extract and purify PHB. Nevertheless these solvents are highly pollutant,\ntoxic and even carcinogenic, so their use is highly undesirable.\n\n In this protocol 1,2-propylene carbonate is used as an effective way to\nextract and purify PHB, without the drawbacks of chlorinated compounds. These\nsolvent requires a temperature higher than 100 \u00b0C in order to achieve an efficient\nsolubilization  of  the  PHB.  However,  its  high  boiling  point  (242  \u00b0C),  low  vapor\npressure at room temperature and non toxicity makes it a very easy solvent to\nwork with.\n\n This protocol consists of three steps, namely 1) cellular lyses and release of\nthe PHB chain; 2) solubilization of PHB and separation from the cellular debris; 3)\nrecover  and  quantification  of  the  PHB.  The  complete  procedure  is  described\nbelow:\n\nD.2 Cellular lysis\n\nD.2.1 Material needed:\na) Hypochlorite solution (bleach) with 6% of active chlorine (20\u00b0);\nb) Falcon tubes (one per sample)\n\n\n\n D.2\n\nc) 20 mL sampling pipettes and pipette filler\nd) Centrifuge\n\nD.2.2 Method:\na) Withdrawn 20 mL of sample and centrifuge it for 10 minutes at 10,000 rpm.\nb) Discard  the  supernatant  and  resuspend  the  biomass  in  20  mL  of  a\n\nhypochlorite solution 20\u00b0 (6% of active chlorine).\nc) After 5 minutes, add 1 mL of H2SO4 1M in order to neutralize the pH of the\n\nsolution. This will protect the PHB from being hydrolyzed. The addition of\nacid  may  originate  chlorine  gas  and  thus  should  be  done  inside  a  fume\nhood.\n\nd) Immediately centrifuge for 10 minutes at 10,000 rpm. Discard the\nsupernatant and rinse it with demineralized water. Centrifuge one more\ntime for 10 minutes at 10,000 rpm and discard the supernatant.\n\nD.3 Dissolution of PHB and separation from the\ncellular debris\n\nD.3.1 Material needed:\na) 1,2-propylene carbonate (40 mL per sample)\nb) Destruction tubes (1 per sample + 2 extra ones)\nc) Heating plaque for destruction tubes at 130 \u00b0C\nd) Glass vacuum filtration system\ne) Fiber glass filters without binding agents, pore size of 0.47 \u00b5m\nf) Cold methanol (~ 170 mL per sample)\ng) 100 mL cylinder\nh) 500 mL Schott bottles with stopper (1 per sample)\ni) Tweezers\n\nD.3.2 Method:\na) Resuspend the lysed biomass in 20 mL of 1,2-propylene carbonate and pour\n\nit to a destruction tube.\n\n\n\n D.3\n\nb) In  a  clean  tube,  add  20  mL  of  1,2-propylene  carbonate.  This  tube,  with\nsolvent  only,  will  be  used  to  warm  the  filtering  system  before  filtering  the\nsamples. This will avoid PHB precipitation due to the cool down of the\nsolvent.\n\nc) In  another  clean  tube  without  biomass,  add  10  mL  of  propylene-carbonate\nper each one of the samples. This will be used to wash the destruction tube\nand filter after each filtration.\n\nd) Warm all the tubes at 130 \u00b0C for at least 15 minutes, shaking the samples\nevery 5 minutes. The samples should remain at 130 \u00b0C till they are filtrated,\nin order to avoid PHB precipitation.\n\ne) In the meanwhile, prepare the vacuum filtration system.\nf) After warming the samples for 15 minutes, use the extra tube with solvent\n\n(prepared on step b) to warm up the filtering system, in order to avoid PHB\nprecipitation and clogging of the filter.\n\ng) Take the solvent from the filtering erlenmeyer flask back to the destruction\ntube  and  put  it  back  in  the  heating  plaque.  This  may  be  useful  later  on  if\nmore hot solvent is necessary.\n\nh) Filter one sample and let it be filtered completely. Use 10 mL of hot solvent\nto wash the sample tube and pour it on the top of the filter.\n\ni) Recover the liquid in the filtration erlenmeyer to a Schott bottle and rinse\nthe flask with cold methanol (-20 \u00b0C). Pour that methanol to the Schott\nbottle as well, till a final volume of ~ 200 mL. Methanol is added as an anti-\nsolvent, thus precipitating the PHB in the Schott bottles.\n\nj) Repeat steps \u201ch\u201d and \u201di\u201d for the other samples still in the heating plaque.\nReplace the fiber glass filter every time that necessary.\n\nk) Let the content in Schott bottles to rest overnight.\n\nD.4 PHB recovery\n\nD.4.1 Material:\na) Vacuum filtration system\nb) Drying oven at 105 \u00b0C\nc) Freezer\n\n\n\n D.4\n\nd) (Pre- weighted, unused) fiber glass filters without binding agents, pore size\nof 0.47 \u00b5m (1 per sample)\n\ne) Petri dishes (1 per sample)\nf) Methanol (-20 \u00b0C)\n\nD.4.2 Method:\na) Put unused fiber glass filters in Petri dishes and dry them overnight at 105\n\n\u00b0C in order to remove any water.\nb) Weight the filters after cooling down and register the value.\nc) Use these filters to recover the precipitated PHB in the Schott bottles.\nd) The  bottle  and  filter  should  be  washed  with  an  additional  methanol  in\n\norder not to lose any PHB and to remove any trace of propylene carbonate.\ne) Dry  the  filters  on  their  respective  Petri  dish  in  the  oven.  After  cooling\n\ndown, weight them again.\nf) Calculate the concentration of PHB in the sludge sample."}]}}}
