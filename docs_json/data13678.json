The comprehension of the main sources of \n\nvariability of the photochemical and the light absorption efficiencies in marine \n\nphytoplankton has increased in the past years, largely by studies using monospecific \n\ncultures. In natural communities, however, the development of primary production \n\nmodels based on chlorophyll-a fluorescence remain limited as they are simultaneously \n\nsubjected to a wide range of environmental and biological factors. This study will test the \n\nhypothesis that photo-physiological models for primary production estimates can be \n\nimproved when key phytoplankton features, such as the pigments composition and \n\ndominant cell size, are taking into account. The approach was to contrast the photo-\n\nphysiological parameters derived from measurements in distinct oceanographic regions, \n\nas well as those derived in a specific environment with presented different nutrient \n\nconcentration according to the time of sampling. In addition, we showed for monospecific \n\ncultures, how the photo-physiological parameters are quantitatively related to the \n\nproduction of carbon under the interactive effects of taxonomic composition and cell size. \n\nThe proportions of photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments present in the \n\ncommunitywere related to the bulk photochemical efficiency and the cross-section of \n\nlight absorption, but varied among oceanographic regionsand the depthof the water \n\ncolumn. A parameterization of fluorescence-derived primary production rates, using four \n\ndominant size classes, was derived for natural phytoplankton communities under different \n\nnutrients conditions in a coastal environment, showing that the parameters differed among \n\nsize classes above a threshold of nutrient concentration. The direct conversion rates \n\nbetween fluorescence-derived primary production and carbon assimilation rates, \n\ncomputed for two distinct phytoplankton cell sizes grown in controlled laboratorial \n\nconditions, showed that cell size strongly influences the efficiency of light absorption and \n\nphotochemistry, however species-specific responses in photosynthetic energy allocation \n\ndominated the differences observed in how absorbed light is utilized to carbon \n\nassimilation, i.e., in the electron requirements for carbon assimilation. The results \n\nhighlighted the importance of the tight coupling of nutrients availability and \n\nphytoplankton communities, as well as for measurements of chlorophyll-a fluorescence \n\nin the ocean and primary production models. This work presents a novel contribution to \n\nthe increasing efforts to apply fluorescence-based techniques to understand and \n\nparameterize primary production estimates in marine systems, especially at highly \n\ndynamic environments. \n\nKey-words: Chlorophyll-a fluorescence; Phytoplankton photosynthesis; Photosystem II \n\n(PSII) efficiency; Primary production \n\n\n\nviii \n \n\nResumo (Portugu\u00eas) \n\nA fluoresc\u00eancia da clorofila-a do fitopl\u00e2ncton, medida in situ, pode ser uma ferramenta \n\npara estimar produ\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria no oceano em grande escala temporal e espacial. Esta \n\nt\u00e9cnica n\u00e3o-invasiva permite an\u00e1lises r\u00e1pidas de par\u00e2metros foto-fisiol\u00f3gicos ao contr\u00e1rio \n\nde metodologias tradicionais (assimila\u00e7\u00e3o de 14C e produ\u00e7\u00e3o de O2). Os principais \n\npar\u00e2metros foto-fisiol\u00f3gicos de instrumentos dispon\u00edveis hoje tratam-se de efici\u00eancias, e \n\ncomo tal, requerem cuidados em serem interpretados. A compreens\u00e3o das principais \n\nfontes de variabilidade da efici\u00eancia fotoqu\u00edmica e de absor\u00e7\u00e3o de luz no fitopl\u00e2ncton \n\nmarinho tem aumentado nos \u00faltimos anos, em sua maioria em cultivos monoespec\u00edficos. \n\nEm comunidades naturais, entretanto, o desenvolvimento de modelos de produ\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nprim\u00e1ria baseados na fluoresc\u00eancia da clorofila-a ainda \u00e9 limitado uma vez que est\u00e3o \n\nsujeitos \u00e0 uma ampla gama de fatores ambientais e biol\u00f3gicos. Esse estudo testa a hip\u00f3tese \n\nde que modelos foto-fisiol\u00f3gicos para estimar produ\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria podem ser aprimorados \n\nconsiderando-se caracter\u00edsticas fundamentais do fitopl\u00e2ncton, como a composi\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\npigmentos e tamanho celular dominante. A estrat\u00e9gia foi contrastar par\u00e2metros foto-\n\nfisiol\u00f3gicos derivados de medidas em regi\u00f5es oceanogr\u00e1ficas distintas, assim como \n\nmedidas em um ambiente espec\u00edfico com diferentes concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de nutrientes ao longo \n\ndo per\u00edodo amostrado. Adicionalmente, apresentamos atrav\u00e9s de cultivos \n\nmonoespec\u00edficos, como par\u00e2metros foto-fisiol\u00f3gicos s\u00e3o quantitativamente relacionados \n\n\u00e0 produ\u00e7\u00e3o de carbono e os efeitos interativos da composi\u00e7\u00e3o taxon\u00f4mica e tamanho \n\ncelular nessa rela\u00e7\u00e3o. A propor\u00e7\u00e3o de pigmentos fotossint\u00e9ticos e fotoprotetores da \n\ncomunidade foram relacionados \u00e0 efici\u00eancia fotoqu\u00edmica e se\u00e7\u00e3o transversal de absor\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde luz, por\u00e9m variaram de acordo com a regi\u00e3o oceanogr\u00e1fica e profundidade na coluna \n\nd\u2019\u00e1gua. Uma parameteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de taxas de produ\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria derivadas da fluoresc\u00eancia, \n\nusando quatro classes de tamanho dominantes, foi proposta para comunidades naturais de \n\nfitopl\u00e2ncton sob condi\u00e7\u00f5es de nutrientes diferentes em um ambiente costeiro, mostrando \n\nque os par\u00e2metros diferiram entre as classes de tamanho acima de um limiar de \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de nutrientes. As taxas de convers\u00e3o diretas entre produ\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria \n\nderivada da fluoresc\u00eancia e taxas de assimila\u00e7\u00e3o de carbono, computadas para dois \n\ntamanhos de fitopl\u00e2ncton crescidos em condi\u00e7\u00f5es controladas em laborat\u00f3rio, mostraram \n\nque tamanho celular influencia as efici\u00eancias de absor\u00e7\u00e3o de luz e fotoqu\u00edmica, por\u00e9m \n\nrespostas esp\u00e9cie-espec\u00edficas na aloca\u00e7\u00e3o de energia fotossint\u00e9tica dominaram as \n\ndiferen\u00e7as observadas em como a luz absorvida \u00e9 utilizada para assimila\u00e7\u00e3o de carbono, \n\nou seja, na raz\u00e3o de el\u00e9trons exigidos para assimila\u00e7\u00e3o de carbono. Os resultados \n\ndestacam a import\u00e2ncia do acoplamento da disponibilidade de nutrientes com a \n\ncomunidade fitoplanct\u00f4nica, assim como das medidas de fluoresc\u00eancia da clorofila-a no \n\noceano e nos modelos de produ\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria. Este trabalho apresenta uma contribui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nin\u00e9dita nos esfor\u00e7os crescentes em aplicar t\u00e9cnicas baseadas na fluoresc\u00eancia para \n\nentender e parameterizar estimativas de produ\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria nos sistemas marinhos, \n\nespecialmente em ambientes altamente din\u00e2micos.  \n\nPalavras-chave: Fluoresc\u00eancia da clorofila-a; Fotoss\u00edntese; Efici\u00eancia do fotossistema II \n\n(PSII); Produ\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria \n\n\n\nix \n \n\nList of Figures \n\n \n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.

Methods for estimating primary production in the oceans \n\nPrimary production rates by the marine phytoplankton provide CO2 fixation, \n\nO2 production and the synthesis of organic matter through the photosynthetic process \n\n(Falkowski and Raven 2007) for the largest portion of the global marine environments \n\n(Field et al. 1998; Longhurst 1998). In its simplest formulation, the photosynthesis can \n\nbe described as: \n\nH2O + CO2 + light (photons) ? CH2O (organic matter) + O2 \n\nwhere light is absorbed by the photosynthetic pigments in the light harvesting \n\nantenna complex of phytoplankton cells which is then directed to the chlorophyll-a \n\nmolecules present on the reaction centers (RC) of photosystem II (PSII). The efficiency \n\nwith which the light energy is absorbed and directed to the photosynthetic process \n\ndepend on a number of environmental constrains, such as nutritional and physiological \n\nstates of the cells (Cleveland et al. 1989; Geider et al. 1993), irradiance fields (Long et \n\nal. 1994; Oxborough and Baker 2000) and water temperature (Kiefer and Mitchell \n\n1983). \n\nO2 evolution and CO2 fixation are described as the end products of \n\nphotosynthesis are the most common methods to quantify primary production rates, \n\nboth representing different biochemical reactions although tightly coupled (Ryther \n\n1956; Williams &amp; Jenkinson 1982; Bender et al. 1987; Laws 1991) and are to date the \n\nmost common methods to measure primary production. Other methods to quantify the \n\nend products of photosynthesis have been applied, based on stable isotope additions, \n\nusing the labelled 13C and 18O as tracers (see Regaudie-de-Gioux et al. 2014). The \n\n\n\n2 \n\ndifferent methods and measurement protocols, such as incubation time, will provide \n\nrates of gross or net primary production. The gross primary production (GPP) is the \n\ntotal photosynthesis, while the net production (NPP) is the total photosynthesis minus \n\nthe respiration rates.  \n\nThe standard method to estimate primary production in the ocean is to measure \n\nthe uptake of radioactive 14C (Steeman-Nielsen 1952), which is sensitive in areas where \n\nphytoplankton biomass is low, especially in the open oceans. Oxygen production \n\nmethods are less sensitive and require longer incubations (Bender et al. 1999) but can \n\ndifferentiate GPP from NPP, while 14C uptake estimates GPP or something in between \n\nGPP and NPP, depending on incubation time. However, both the 14C uptake and the O2 \n\nproduction methods require incubation of samples for a certain period of time, \n\ngenerating methodological constraints driven by confinement of the samples in \n\ncontainers and consequently, alterations in the microorganisms composition and in the \n\nphysiological status of phytoplankton (Eppley 1980; Bender et al. 1987; Grande et al. \n\n1989; Marra 2002). Samples contamination by trace metals can be another issue, mainly \n\nassociated with14C stock solutions and the surfaces of the containers (Fitzwater et al. \n\n1982). Furthermore, there are still limitations regarding the results analysis, mostly \n\nassociated with the uncertainties in the respiration and other metabolic rates (Bender et \n\nal. 1999; Williams et al. 2002). The respiration during incubation periods can \n\neffectively recycle fixed CO2 depending on the incubation time, thus preventing the \n\naccurate discrimination of gross from net primary production rates (Marra 2002; \n\nRegaudie-de-Gioux et al. 2014). \n\n2. Fluorescence-derived primary production \n\nTo overcome some of the challenges associated with conventional \n\nmeasurements of primary production rates in the oceans, non-invasive techniques \n\n\n\n3 \n\n(incubation-free) based on variations in the active fluorescence of chlorophyll-a have \n\nbeen developed (Kolber &amp; Falkowski, 1993). The active fluorescence method quantifies \n\nthe fluorescence emission by PSII during the photosynthetic process (Genty et al. 1989; \n\nFalkowski et al. 1986).  \n\nThe photosynthetic apparatus in marine phytoplankton is composed of two \n\nphotosynthetic units (PSI and PSII) distributed in the thylakoid membrane, inside the \n\nchloroplasts of the photosynthetic organisms (Figure 1). These units are responsible for \n\nthe photochemical reactions that fix the carbon and oxidize the water molecules to \n\nproduce the oxygen. These reactions are linked to the transference of electrons. \n\n \nFigure 1. Distribution of thylakoids inside the chloroplasts (above) highlighting the \n\nphotosynthetic chain occuring in the membrane of the thylakoids (below). The black retangle \n\nindicates the PSII associated with the light harvesting antenna complex and the reactions centers \n\n(RCII), where the initial step of the electron transport chain occurs. The yellow arrows indicate \n\nwhere the light is absorbed by the thylakoids membrane and the red arrows are the pathways of \n\nthe electron during the photosynthetic chain until the energy generation for the CO2 fixation at \n\nthe Calvin cycle. More details of the reactions are in the text (Figure adapted from Huot and Babin \n\n2010). \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nThe PSII contain the light harvesting complex (LHCII), which are antenna \n\npigment complexes, and the reaction centers (RCII), which is composed of a core \n\ncomplex of proteins and chlorophylls and it is where the first step of electron transfer \n\noccurs. When the chlorophyll-a molecules of the RCII receive the energy from light \n\nabsorption, an electron is donated to a primary electron acceptor, the Quinone A (QA) \n\nmolecule, where the linear electron flow begins (see red arrows in Figure 1). \n\nThe linear electron flow generates a proton gradient (H+) between the exterior \n\nof the thylakoid (stroma) and the interior of the thylakoid (lumen), through a series of \n\nreduction and oxidation reactions. The H+ gradient across the thylakoid membrane is \n\nresponsible for generating energy (ATP), through the ATP-synthase, also part of the \n\nthylakoid membrane (Figure 1). Further in the photosynthetic chain, the PSI is \n\nresponsible for donating the electron to the end electron acceptor (ferrodoxin \u2013 Fd) that \n\nwith the ferrodoxin-NADP reductase (FNR) reduces NADP to NADPH. The ATP and \n\nNADPH produced are energy sources to the carbon fixation in the Calvin cycle.  \n\nWhen a chlorophyll-a molecule in the antenna pigments complex absorbs \n\nphotons, magnesium (Mg) atoms of the chlorophyll are excited from a lower (ground) \n\nto a higher (excited) energy state. When the chlorophyll-a molecule returns to its ground \n\nstate, the energy released has two possible pathways (Figure 2): i. dissipation by heat, ii. \n\ntransfer by inductive resonance to the adjacent molecules towards the reaction centers to \n\nbe directed to the photochemical process and iii. re-emission of photons by a process \n\ncalled as fluorescence (Falkowski and Raven 2007; Govindjee 2004). The proportions \n\nof absorbed photons that are directed to each of the three competing pathways are \n\nrepresented by the quantum yield of energy dissipation (\u00d8H), photosynthesis (\u00d8P) and \n\nfluorescence (\u00d8F), respectively (Figure 2a). The quantum yields are, thus, directly \n\nrelated to the probability of the three distinct processes to occur (Govindjee 1995; \n\n\n\n5 \n\nPapageorgiou and Govindjee 2004). When the energy is directed to the photosynthetic \n\nactivity, the fluorescence is reduced by the so-called photochemical quenching (qP), \n\nwhile the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) refers to the energy dissipation by heat. \n\nAssuming the quantum yields for energy dissipation as constant, the quantum \n\nyields for photosynthesis and fluorescence will be high and low, respectively, in \n\ndarkness or very low light, as the PSII molecules are open and available to receive \n\nphotons (Figure 2b). As light intensity increases, the QA molecules become reduced and \n\nthe PSII close accordingly, increasing the quantum yields of fluorescence. When all the \n\nPSII are closed, the subsequent photons absorbed are then re-emitted as fluorescence, \n\nuntil a maximum fluorescence quantum yield is reached (Figure 2c). Note that the \n\ndissipation by heat has to be considered constant for this simple model to work. \n\nHowever, the relationship between chlorophyll fluorescence and photochemistry \n\nbecomes non-linear as a suite of heat losses mechanisms will come into play when cells \n\nare exposed to high light (Papageorgiou and Govindjee 2004; Lin et al. 2016). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nFigure 2. Three competing pathways of the absorbed photons by the PSII: photosynthesis (\u00d8P), \n\nfluorescence (\u00d8F) and heat dissipation (\u00d8H). a) the probability of a photon to be directed to each \n\nof the paths are the same; b) the probability of a photon to be directed to photosynthesis is higher, \n\ndue to the low light or dark-acclimation of the cells and c) the probability of fluorescence increases \n\nas light increases until all the PSII are closed (no photosynthesis) and the fluorescence are \n\nmaximal. The arrows thickness is proportional to the relative contribution of each process. \n\n \n\nThe simple model of competing quantum yields assumes that the fluorescence \n\nquantum yield, or fluorescence efficiency, varies inversely to the photochemical \n\nefficiency, depending on the proportion of open reactions centers (Kiefer and Reynolds \n\n1992), defined as the fluorescence path dynamics. Therefore, changes in fluorescence \n\nquantum yields provide information on the photosynthetic process (Kolber and \n\nFalkowski 1993), and that is the principle applied in the available commercial \n\nfluorometers. The instruments are designed to measuring the fluorescence from PSII \n\nderived from the induction of a maximal fluorescence and provide photo-physiological \n\nparameters that are related to the proportion of \u201cclosed\u201d reaction centers during \n\nphotosynthesis (Kolber and Falkowski, 1993; Suggett et al. 2003; Oxborough et al. \n\n2012).  \n\nThe fluorescence technique uses the emission of a saturating light (usually in \n\nthe blue wavelength) that is strong enough to promote the variable fluorescence in a \n\n\n\n7 \n\ntime scale of \u00b5s, reducing all QA, thus saturating the photochemical path and promoting \n\nthe maximal fluorescence. In darkness, when all the PSII are open and available to \n\nconduct photons to the photosynthesis, the fluorescence emitted by these molecules is \n\nminimal or basal, which is represented by F0. As incident light increases, the \n\nfluorescence increases up to a maximum value, designated Fm, when all the PSII are \n\nclosed. The variable fluorescence (Fv) is the difference between Fm and F0 (Fv= Fm - F0) \n\nand the ratio Fv/Fm is a measurement of how efficient the cells saturate the \n\nphotochemical capacity and reaches the maximal fluorescence yield (Lazar 1999; \n\nMaxwell and Johnson, 2000). In ambient light, the ratio between Fv and Fm is defined as \n\nthe effective photochemical efficiency (or Fq?/Fm?), and will be smaller than the \n\nmaximum observed in cells dark-acclimated samples, as the pool of open PSII to \n\nreceive photons is smaller. Other parameter that is derived from the variable \n\nfluorescence methods is related to the efficiency to which the energy captured by \n\nincident light is converted to electron transfer process in PSII, defined as the functional \n\nabsorption cross-section of PSII (?PSII) (Kolber and Falkowski 1993).  \n\nThe Kolber and Falkowski (1993) model estimates the electron transfer rate \n\n(ETR) in phytoplankton cells, which is considered as an alternative tool to estimate \n\nprimary production in aquatic environments (Suggett et al. 2010). A detailed \n\nexplanation of how ETR is calculated from photo-physiological parameters, and how it \n\nrelates to carbon fixation and primary production rates, will be given in chapters 3 and 4 \n\nof this document. The most commonly used active fluorometers in oceanography are \n\nsingle turnover Fast Repetition Rate-type fluorometer (FRRf) (Kolber et al. 1998), and \n\ntheir derivatives, such as the Fluorescence Induction and Relaxation System (FIRe) \n\n(Gorbunov and Falkowski 2005). The protocols for exciting and measuring variable \n\nfluorescence are distinct among instruments, however they provide very similar photo-\n\n\n\n8 \n\nphysiological responses. The correct interpretation of the results provided by the \n\ndifferent instruments and protocols are not straightforward and deserve caution (Huot \n\nand Babin 2010). A number of studies are still required before variable fluorescence \n\ntechniques become the standard primary production methods in the oceans, especially \n\nfor natural phytoplankton communities. \n\n3. Hypothesis and goals \n\nThe present work is based on the general hypothesis that the photo-\n\nphysiological model for primary production estimates can be parameterized and \n\nimproved considering key phytoplankton features. Considering that the environmental \n\nconditions impose a large impact on the phytoplankton communities and thus in the \n\nphoto-physiology, this work comprises a large dataset with contrasting oceanographic \n\nregimes. The central objective was then to contribute for a better understanding of the \n\nchlorophyll-a fluorescence technique and its main sources of variation, as well as to \n\npropose parameterizations according to the phytoplankton community structure, such as \n\ncell size classes and their pigments composition. In addition, we have shown how the \n\nvariable fluorescence can be converted in carbon-based primary production estimates, \n\nand the interactive effects of taxonomy and cell size on this conversion. Thus, the \n\nspecific objectives were approached in the following chapters: \n\nChapter 2: To describe the photo-physiological parameters (Fv/Fm and ?PSII) of \n\nnatural phytoplankton communities across distinct oceanographic regimes and trophic \n\nstatus at a large portion of the subtropical Atlantic Ocean, with emphasis on the \n\nrelationships between such photo-physiological parameters and the pigment ratios of the \n\nphytoplankton community. We hypothesize that the use of pigments ratios would \n\nsignificantly improve the description and interpretation of Fv/Fm and ?PSII across \n\ndifferent oceanographic regimes as these ratios represent not only biomass and \n\n\n\n9 \n\ntaxonomy, but also the interactions among taxonomy and acclimation processes, which \n\nwill reflect in the bulk signal of the community photo-physiology. \n\nChapter 3: to examine the relationship between the dominant size of natural \n\nphytoplankton communities and variability of photo-physiological parameters, i.e. \n\nFv/Fm and ?PSII, simultaneously considering different ambient nutrients conditions. The \n\nsampling design allowed discrimination of the effects of different levels of nutrient \n\navailability from cell size on the parameterization of fluorimetric photo-physiology \n\nmodels. \n\nChapter 4: to examine for the first time whether cell size influences photo-\n\nphysiological performance and light harvesting properties, specifically the direct \n\ncomparison of ETR and carbon fixation, as well as allocation of inorganic assimilated \n\ncarbon into organic cell compounds, testing the consistency across different \n\nphytoplankton taxonomical groups with well-documented differences in photosynthetic \n\nphysiology. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\nRelationships between photophysiological fluorescence-derived parameters and \n\nthe composition of phytoplankton pigments observed in distinct oceanographic \n\nprocesses in the subtropical South Atlantic \n\n1. Introduction \n\nIn the ocean, phytoplankton growth responds to a large dynamic range of \n\nlimitation by resources (Falkowski 1994) and biological interactions that are, at first \n\norder, governed by the dynamics of the environment (Cullen et al. 2002). Oceanic \n\nprocesses of varied temporal and spatial scales determine light and nutrient availability \n\nthat not only alter phytoplankton abundances and species composition but also control \n\ntheir activities and consequently role on biogeochemical cycles (Gargett and Marra \n\n2002). Over the scales of main oceanographic processes, therefore, it is of equal \n\nimportance to measure the variability of phytoplankton abundances (Longhurst et al. \n\n1995) and their photosynthetic performances (Huot et al. 2007a). \n\nSpatial and temporal variability of phytoplankton abundance can be inferred \n\nfrom satellite images derived from ocean color sensors over large horizontal scales \n\n(O\u2019Reilly et al. 1998), while small-scale variability of phytoplankton abundance is \n\nusually estimated by simple fluorimeters (Lorenzen 1966). Both ocean color and \n\nfluorimetric approaches easily estimate chlorophyll concentrations as a proxy for \n\nphytoplankton abundance, which despite of its important prediction power for \n\nphotosynthetic parameters (Huot et al. 2007b) cannot account alone for primary \n\nproduction rates, especially over large scales (e.g., Saba et al. 2011). Primary production \n\nclassic techniques are expensive and time-consuming limiting, thus, temporal and \n\nspatial coverage (see Regaudie-de-Gioux et al. 2014). \n\n\n\n11 \n\nInstruments that provide near-real time estimates of photosynthetic \n\nperformance of natural phytoplankton communities have been available for many years. \n\nThese non-invasive techniques are based on measurements of variable fluorescence and \n\nits relationship with the electrons transfer rates (ETR, with units of mol e- (molPSII)-1 h-\n\n1, where PSII is the photosystem unit of the cells), during the photosynthesis (Kolber \n\nand Falkowski 1993). Key parameters derived from variable fluorescence measurements \n\ninclude the maximal photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), directly related with the \n\nphotosynthetic performance, and the functional absorption cross-section (?PSII), which is \n\na function of the light harvesting efficiency and utilization by the bulk phytoplankton \n\ncommunity. However, the complexity of fluorescence by phytoplankton (Laz\u00e1r 1999) in \n\naddition to the different protocols available (Huot and Babin 2010), makes the \n\ninterpretation of results derived from variable fluorescence far from straightforward \n\n(Suggett et al. 2010). It is important to note that variable fluorescence originates almost \n\nexclusively from the chlorophyll molecules present in the photosystems. \n\n When the variable fluoresce technique is applied to phytoplankton cultures \n\ngrown in laboratory, the observed values for Fv/Fm and ?PSII have been associated with \n\ntaxonomic composition, cell size (Suggett et al. 2009) and modes of nutrient supply \n\n(Parkhill et al. 2001). In natural phytoplankton communities, Fv/Fm and ?PSII also vary \n\nwith taxonomic composition and cell size but can also respond strongly to photo-\n\nacclimation and photo-adaptation (Moore et al. 2006), especially in nutrient-limited \n\nenvironments (Moore et al. 2008; Suggett et al. 2009). Because of that, the relationships \n\nbetween the photo-physiological parameters and natural communities may also vary \n\nremarkably with depth. A common observed feature in stratified oceans is the deep \n\nchlorophyll maximum (DCM) layer, which is maintained by a number of distinct \n\nprocesses that range from enhanced growth driven by nutrients to selection of photo-\n\n\n\n12 \n\nadapted and photo-aclimated populations, from eutrophic to oligotrophic environments \n\nrespectively (Cullen 2015). Thus, the photo-physiological parameters of distinct \n\nphytoplankton communities are expected to vary between surface and the DCM, but not \n\npredictably across a range of trophic status. \n\nFor a given oceanographic process that provide a gradient of nutrient supply, \n\nand therefore, a gradient of trophic status composed of different phytoplankton \n\ncommunities (see discussion in Ciotti et al. 1999), we hypothesized that observed values \n\nof Fv/Fm and ?PSII will resemble that presented by Suggett et al. (2009), with Fv/Fm \n\nincreasing from oligotrophic to eutrophic areas, while ?PSII decreases, as communities \n\nwill change dominance from small to larger cells. These gradient of cell size is expected \n\nto alter the efficiency for light absorption as well (Ciotti et al. 2002), which will tend to \n\ndecrease with increasing cell size. Ciotti et al. (in preparation) have shown that the \n\nvariability observed in pigment packaging at the surface is much higher than that \n\nobserved in the DCM across large trophic gradients in the Atlantic and Pacific. \n\nThere are no universal metrics for a given phytoplankton community and \n\ncommon approaches simplify the taxonomy of natural communities according with \n\ndominance of major groups given by either microscopy-cytometry or pigment profiles. \n\nA selection of diagnostic marker pigments (Claustre 1994) can be used to indicate major \n\ntaxonomical groups present (Mackey 1996, Jeffrey et al. 2011) or to assign dominance \n\nof phytoplankton size fractions (e.g. Vidussi et al. 2001; Uitz et al. 2006). Indeed, when \n\npresent in substantial proportions, a diagnostic pigment provides a robust tool indicating \n\nthe presence of a given taxonomic group. However, some of the pigments excluded \n\nfrom these procedures could help to explain the variability observed in \n\nphotophysiological parameters.  \n\n\n\n13 \n\nIn ocean, where phytoplankton are subject to highly dynamic environmental \n\nconditions, the taxonomical classification from pigments into specific groups might be \n\nprecluded by the variability of cellular pigment proportions as a response of \n\nphysiological state (Henriksen et al. 2002). Pigments concentration, and especially their \n\nproportion to chlorophyll-a concentration, may indicate nutrient-limited growth \n\n(Goerick and Montoya 1998; Henriksen et al. 2002) and photoacclimation processes \n\n(Macintyre et al. 2002). Detection of chlorophyll-a degradation products can also be \n\nused as bulk physiological index, such as the proportion of chlorophyllide originated \n\nfrom senescence (Jefrey 1974, Wright et al. 2010), but no information of the extent to \n\nwhich Fv/Fm and ?PSII can be explained by phytoplankton pigment composition, without \n\na priori classification into specific taxonomic groups, is available. We hypothesize that \n\nthe use of pigments ratios would significantly improve the description and interpretation \n\nof Fv/Fm and ?PSII across different oceanographic regimes as these ratios represent not \n\nonly biomass and taxonomy, but also the interactions among taxonomy and acclimation \n\nprocesses, which will reflect in the bulk signal of the community photo-physiology.  \n\nThe objectives of the present work are characterizing the photo-physiology of \n\nphytoplankton communities using chlorophyll-a fluorescence-derived parameters (Fv/Fm \n\nand ?PSII) in different oceanographic processes of the subtropical South Atlantic Ocean, \n\ncontrasting the observations from surface and from DCM. The photo-physiological \n\nparameters were related to pigment ratios across distinct oceanographic regimes and \n\ntrophic status. The relationships found between photo-physiology and individual \n\npigments were compared to those observed between other physiological indexes, based \n\non pigments, such as the sum of total photosynthetic (PSC) and photo-protective \n\ncarotenoids (PPC) (Barlow et al. 2002), size fractions in the community (Uitz et al. \n\n2006) and an index of degradation products (Wright et al. 2010).  In addition, the effects \n\n\n\n14 \n\nof an index for pigments packaging, or size factor (S(f); Ciotti et al. 2002) on the photo-\n\nphysiology was evaluated. \n\n2. Methods \n\n2.1. Study Area \n\nContrasting oceanographic regions were sampled during the spring and early \n\nsummer of 2011 in the Southern Atlantic Ocean, as part of the CO2 South Atlantic \n\nSubtropical project. The cruise attended a multidisciplinary study focused on better \n\nunderstanding phytoplankton dynamics and ocean-atmospheric fluxes of carbon. The \n\ncruise left Rio Grande, Brazil (32\u00b01\u2019S; 52\u00b05\u2019W) on October 24 2011 and crossed the \n\n35?S meridian to Cape Town, Africa, returning to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (22\u00b055\u201dS; \n\n43\u00b09\u2019W) in December 23 2011. The 35?S transect was chosen due to the reports of \n\nimportant CO2 input from the atmosphere are (Takahashi et al. 2009; Khatiwala et al. \n\n2009) combined to the lack of in situ data of this sector of the South Atlantic Ocean. \n\nThe dynamic range of oceanographic conditions is expected to provide conditions of \n\ndiverse phytoplankton communities with contrasting pigment compositions and \n\nphotosynthetic activities.  \n\nThe surface water masses in this sector of the Atlantic Ocean are forced by the \n\natmospheric systems associated with the South Equatorial and Circumpolar Currents \n\n(Peterson and Stramma 1991) that defines the mean latitudinal position of the \n\nSubtropical Front (STF) in response to the expansion and contraction of the South \n\nAtlantic Subtropical Gyre (McClain et al. 2004). During austral spring and summer, \n\nhigh phytoplankton standing stocks are observed along the STF (suggested by ocean \n\ncolor imagery - Tilstone et al. 2009) consistent with net CO2 fluxes from the \n\natmosphere. Studies also suggest increase in primary production rates in this region \n\nrelated to the increase in photosynthetic rates (e.g. Maranan and Holligan 1999).  \n\n\n\n15 \n\nNotable features associated with the STF are mesoescale eddies, which disturbs the \n\nvertical position of the picnocline and can either promote input from nutrients from \n\nbellow stimulating phytoplankton growth (McGillicuddy et al. 2007) or transport \n\nsurface waters bellow (Omand et al. 2015). \n\nThe observations were carried out over four distinct areas: i) a section across \n\nthe continental margin near the plume of La Plata river (n(surface)= 7 and n(DCM)= 8), ii) a \n\nlongitudinal section across the South Atlantic Subtropical Front (STF) (n(surface)= 55 and \n\nn(DCM)= 41), iii) a section across the upwelling near Benguela (n(surface)= 9 and n(DCM)= \n\n5), and iv) a section across the South Atlantic Subtropical Gyre (n(surface)= 20 and \n\nn(DCM)= 17) (Figure 1). Details about sectors i to iii can be found in Lencina-Avila et al \n\n(2016).  \n\n \nFigure 1. Sampling stations during the CO2 South Atlantic Subtropical Project (October to \n\nDecember 2011), departing from Brazil to Africa in a survey across 35?S of latitude adjacent to \n\nthe Subtropical Front. The second leg of the cruise, departed from Cape Town, crossing the \n\nBenguela upwelling area and followed towards Brazil, crossing the Subtropical Gyre. \n\nDiscontinuities of stations refers to bad weather and operational problems. \n\n \n\n2.2. Oceanographic data and phytoplankton pigment analysis \n\nIn each oceanographic station, the vertical physical structure of the water \n\nmasses was obtained from casts of a CTD SBE 911 profiler, equipped with temperature, \n\nsalinity, pressure, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll fluorescence and beam attenuation of \n\n\n\n16 \n\nlight sensors. The CTD was attached to a rosette system equipped with 12 Niskin bottles \n\nwith 5L of capacity. Two separated casts were performed in each station: one to a \n\nmaximum depth for chemical samples, followed by a cast limited to 300m for biological \n\nsamples. Vertical transects of temperature were also measured with XBT Deep Blue \n\nprofilers (surface to 760 m, provided by NOAA) in all stations and between stations. \n\nThe gaps in Figure 1 represent logistical problems and unfavorable weather. \n\nDuring the cruise, the oceanographic features were followed using ocean color \n\nsatellite images to monitor alterations on sea surface temperature (SST) and estimated \n\nchlorophyll concentration. Composites of 8 days were used \n\n(http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/cms/). In addition, the presence or absence of eddies \n\nwas determined using high resolution weekly maps of Sea Level Anomaly (DT-MSLA), \n\nobtained for the period of the cruise. The altimeter products were produced by \n\nSsalto/Duacs and distributed by Aviso (Archiving, Validation, and Interpretation of \n\nSatellite Oceanographic), with support from Cnes (http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/duacs). \n\nVortices and eddies were identified according to Chaigneau et al. (2009). These \n\nanalyses were performed by Dr. C.A.E. Garcia\u2019s group at FURG, co-coordinator of the \n\nCO2 South Atlantic Subtropical project. \n\nSamples for chlorophyll-a concentration and photo-physiological parameters \n\nwere chosen based on density and fluorescence profiles to represent when possible: i) \n\nthe surface layer (4-8 meters), ii) the bottom of the mixed layer depth, iii) the depth of \n\nmaximum fluorescence, iv) an intermediary between ii and iii; and v) bottom of the \n\nfluorescence peak. From a total of 92 samples, approximately 75 presented a remarkable \n\nDCM. When a DCM was not clearly observed, we have considered the highest \n\nfluorescence value (chlorophyll-a concentration), below the mixing layer, when higher \n\nthan the surface values. High Performance Liquid Chromatography quantified pigment \n\n\n\n17 \n\nprofiles only for the surface and depth of maximum fluorescence. Sub-samples of 500 \n\nml and 2L, for chlorophyll-a and HPLC pigments, respectively, were concentrated onto \n\nGF/F filters and immediately stored in liquid nitrogen until analysis in the laboratory.  \n\nChlorophyll-a were extracted in 5mL 90% acetone + DMSO solution (6:4 \u2013 \n\nShoaf and Lium 1976) for 24h in dark at -20\u00b0C, and quantified using a calibrated Turner \n\nAU-10 fluorimeter, through the non-acidification method (Welschmeyer 1994). A \n\ncalibration factor obtained from a commercial chlorophyll-a standard (Sigma-Aldrich) \n\nwas used to calculate the final chlorophyll-a concentration of fluorescence \n\nmeasurements.  \n\nThe procedures for measuring chlorophylls, degradation products and accessory \n\ncarotenoids measured by HPLC followed the method from Zapata et al. (2000), \n\nmodified by Mendes et al. (2007). Pigments were identifiedfrom both absorbance \n\nspectra and retention times from the signals in thephotodiode array detector (SPD-\n\nM20A; 190 to 800 nm; 1 nm wavelengthaccuracy) or fluorescence detector (RF-\n\n10AXL; Ex. 430 nm/Em. 670 nm). Pigments were automatically quantified from peak \n\nintegration provided by the LC-Solution software (Shimadzu), but all peak integrations \n\nwere checked manually and corrected when necessary. The HPLC system was \n\npreviously calibrated with pigment standards from DHI (Institute for Water \n\nandEnvironment, Denmark).  \n\nA total of 21 pigments were quantified, including chlorophylls, accessory \n\nphotosynthetic pigments and accessory carotenoids (Table 1). The presence of some \n\nunambiguous marker pigments was used to infer the presence or changes in the \n\nproportion of specific phytoplankton groups, without assuming quantitative \n\nrelationships. These were: Fucoxanthin as a marker for Diatoms, Hex-Fucoxanthin + \n\nChl c2 and c3 for Haptophytes, Zeaxanthin for Synechococcus and DV-Chla for \n\n\n\n18 \n\nProchlorococcus (Wright and Jeffrey 2006; Jeffrey et al. 2011). Some pigments-based \n\nphysiological indexes such as PSC and PPC (Barlow et al. 2002) were computed, as \n\nwell as an index of degradation product of chlorophyll (Wright et al. 2010). \n\nAn index to derive the fraction of small size phytoplankton (f_pico) was \n\ncalculated based on diagnostic pigments of small groups, according to Uitz et al. (2006) \n\n(Equation 1). \n\nf_pico = 1.01 Chl b + 0.86 Zea / ?DP                                 Eq (1) \n\nwhere ?DP = 1.41 Fuco + 1.41 Perid + 1.27 Hex-fuco + 0.35 But-fuco + 0.60 Allo + \n\n1.01 Chl b + 0.86 Zea \n\nA size parameter (or S(f), size factor) was calculated based on the phytoplankton \n\ncommunity absorption spectra, which will refer to the combined effects of pigment \n\npackaging and concentration and composition of accessory pigments (Ciotti et al. 2002). \n\nThe phytoplankton absorption data was obtained from a filter-pad technique, according \n\nto Tassan and Ferrari (1998), using a spectrophotometer Perkin Elmer, Lambda 35.  \n\nTable 1.

Photo-physiological data \n\n\n\n19 \n\nThe subsamples used for determination of photo-physiological parameters were \n\nanalyzed using a fluorescence induction and relaxation technique (Gorbunov and \n\nFalkowski, 2004), which yields the maximal photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) and the \n\nfunctional cross-section of light absorption (?PSII) of the phytoplankton community. \n\nSamples were dark-adapted for 30 to 60 minutes, at room temperature, in clean dark \n\nglass bottles and processed in flow-through mode with a bench-top FIRe instrument \n\n(Satlantic). The flow-through mode allows for better signal to noise results without \n\ndamaging the cells with the multiple sequential flashes necessary for the procedure. The \n\nflow-through cuvette was rinsed with the dark acclimated samples for 2 minutes before \n\nthe fluorescence profiles were registered for about 5 minutes. Note that in flow-through \n\nmode, the Fire instrument gain is automatically adjusted according mainly to the \n\nchlorophyll concentration. Because of that, blanks were processed as samples and all \n\nraw data were processed using a software package developed by MSc. Audrey Barnett \n\n(Fireworx 1.0.4 - https://sourceforge.net/p/fireworx/news/), developed for matlab. \n\nBlanks were 0.2\u00b5m filtrates of a nylon capsule filter (Polycap 75AS, Whatman) of each \n\nsample. Between stations, the cuvette was rinsed with a diluted solution of neutral soap \n\nand freshly produced mili-q water. The steps of Fireworx routine also included the \n\nnormalization of data by the calibration of the blue led used (Figure 2). For logistic \n\nproblems, the calibration files were prepared in the laboratory using known chlorophyll-\n\na solutions several months after the cruise. Nonetheless, the instrument was monitored \n\nmonthly before, during and after the cruise with a fluorescent dye and no significant \n\nresponse changes were observed in the past year. All parameters (i.e., Fo, Fm and ?PSII) \n\nare means of all profiles adjusted during the 5 minutes of data collection that yielded 14 \n\nto 15 profiles in general. A quality control for the parameters was applied, for which \n\n\n\n20 \n\nsamples with coefficients of variation higher than 30% among the 5 minutes running \n\nwere excluded. \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Flow diagram of the photophysiology data processing at fireworx (FIRe data processing \n\nsoftware) to obtain Fv/Fm and ?PSII \n\n \n\n2.4. Data analysis \n\nAs mentioned before, the cruise sampled contrasting oceanographic regions \n\n(Figure 1), and the dataset were divided according: 1. The transect from coast to open \n\nocean crossing the south continental shelf of  Brazil under the influence of the La Plata \n\n\n\n21 \n\nriver plume; 2. The 35\u00b0S longitudinal section, influenced by mesoscale vertical \n\ninstabilities across the STF; 3. The south Africa coastal waters, affected by the \n\nBenguela upwelling; and 4. The session across the subtropical oligotrophic gyre and  \n\nthe Brazil Current. For each region, near surface and the maximum fluorescence depth \n\nwere treated separately.  Note that general relationships between Fv/Fm and ?PSII and \n\nchlorophyll-a were also constructed using fluorimetric data, providing a higher vertical \n\nresolution. The distribution of phytoplankton and the photo-physiological characteristics \n\nof the community were discussed in terms of the main physical drivers of the \n\nhydrographic structure for each of the four sectors, where relationships were tested \n\nthrough linear regression analysis and vertical profiles sections. \n\nThe relationships between the photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) and functional \n\ncross-section of light absorption (?PSII) were analyzed for each of the sectors, as well as \n\nfor different layers (surface versus DCM). Although the relationships between both \n\nparameters found in the literature does not suggest a unique and strictly linear trajectory, \n\nas well as same taxonomic signatures (Moore et al. 2006, Fishwick et al. 2006; Suggett \n\net al. 2009), we decided to present as such as a simple approach for comparison among \n\nsectors and depths, since our goal is not to derive a unique equation, but to identify \n\nconsistent deviations. \n\n A series of pairwise correlations were tested among the ratios of individual \n\npigments and the total accessory pigments (Pigs/?AP) and the photo-physiological \n\nparameters, also for the different sectors. Additional parameters were expected to \n\ncorrelate to Fv/Fm and ?PSII, such as S(f), f_pico, PSC, PPC, Chlide/TChla, and were also \n\ntested. Those analyses were performed at the statistic software R. \n\n3. Results \n\n3.1. Hydrography, pigments and photo-physiological parameters \n\n\n\n22 \n\nThe four sectors sampled showed expected contrasting oceanographic \n\ncharacteristics (Figure 3), and because of that, they are characterized by distinct sources \n\nfor nutrient supply to the surface layers (not shown), resulting in distinct phytoplankton \n\ncommunity structures, as will be presented below.  \n\n \n\nFigure 3. T-S diagrams for each of the analyzed sectors across the Southern Atlantic Ocean \n\n \n\nThe surface waters presented the largest range of variability in chlorophyll-a \n\nconcentration in all sectors, with highest concentrations observed at the surface of \n\nBenguela sector (up to 5 mg m-3) and the lowest at the Gyre (Figure 4). The highest \n\nFv/Fm was also observed for the surface waters of the Benguela, varying from 0.29 to \n\n0.56, and lowest at the 35\u00b0S sector, which varied from 0.11 to 0.38 at the surface and \n\n0.16 to 0.38 at DCM, which shows a phytoplankton community, in general, represented \n\n\n\n23 \n\nby low photochemical efficiency. In this sector, ?PSII varied from 154 to 296 \u00c5\u00b2/photon \n\nat the surface and 197 to 299 \u00c5\u00b2/photon at DCM.  Fv/Fm at the surface of the Gyre sector \n\nwere not computed due to the low signal-to-noisy ratio of the dataset, however at DCM, \n\ndespite the low chlorophyll-a concentrations, Fv/Fm was higher than at 35\u00b0S, ranging \n\nfrom 0.22 to 0.49. The mean values of Fv/Fm and ?PSII at the Benguela sector were \n\nsimilar to the La Plata sector, except for the higher values of ?PSII at the surface in the \n\nBenguela sector (Figure 4). Fv/Fm and ?PSII were not significantly different between both \n\nlayers, especially due to the low dynamic range of this parameters, except at the 35\u00b0S \n\nwhere Fv/Fm at the surface was higher than the DCM (t-test, p<0.01). \n\nThe main differences in the pigments ratios among the sectors are the higher \n\nDV-Chl/Tot Chla in the Gyre, along with a robust contribution of Chl b at DCM, as \n\nwell as the large contribution of Zeaxanthin in the surface at this sector (Figure 5). The \n\nLa Plata and Benguela sectors presented the largest contribution of Fucoxanthin \n\n(Fuco/?AP), while a significant increase in the Hex-Fucoxanthin ratios were observed \n\nat surface and DCM at the 35\u00b0S (Figure 5). \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.

The acronyms in the x-axis are as in Table 1. \n\n \n\nThe relationships between photophysiological parameters and the \n\noceanographic characteristics of each sector are described below: \n\nSector 1: La Plata plume waters \n\nThe observations from the La Plata sector clearly showed the influence of the Plata \n\nPlume Water (PPW) at the surface waters over the continental shelf, with salinity values \n\n\n\n26 \n\nbelow 33 (Figure 6). Offshore, due to the encounter of Brazil and Malvinas Currents, \n\nobserved water masses included the Subtropical Shelf Water (STSW) at the surface of \n\nthe continental shelf break and the SACW over continental slope (Figure 3a). \n\n \n\nFigure 6. Salinity section at the La Plata influenced waters (above) and the relationship between \n\nFv/Fm and ?PSII at the DCM of the La Plata sector, indicating the trajectory of increase in salinity \n\nvalues (below) \n\n \n\nBoth Fv/Fm and ?PSII were highly correlated with salinity at the DCM (r\u00b2=0.67 \n\nand 0.66, respectively), with lower ?PSII and higher Fv/Fm at low salinity waters, which \n\nwere also related with higher Chl-a concentrations (Figure 6). The expected negative \n\nrelationship between Fv/Fm and ?PSII (see Chapter 3) was only observed at the DCM \n\n(r\u00b2=0.51, n=9). \n\nSector 2: 35\u00baS section across de STF \n\n\n\n27 \n\nSharp vertical temperature gradients are observed across the entire section, due \n\nto the high spatial resolution between CTD casts, and a number of mesoescale features \n\nof the picnocline are clearly observed (Figure 7), likely related to the presence of \n\ncyclonic and anti-cyclonic eddies. Indeed, maps of Sea Surface Height (SSH) derived \n\nfrom altimetry (Figure 8) suggested the presence of an anti-cyclonic eddy at 5\u00b0E \n\nlongitude, associated with a deepening of the picnocline (Figure 7). On the other hand, a \n\nshallowing of the picnocline between 10 and 20\u00b0W, suggesting an upwelling center \n\nassociated with a mesoscale cyclonic eddy (Figure 8), promoted an increase in the \n\nchlorophyll-a concentration at the euphotic zone, and CTD fluorimeter casts suggest \n\nthat the deep chlorophyll maximum remained above 60 meters responding to the \n\nfeature. \n\n \nFigure 7.

Sea Surface Height from altimetry weekly data from the South Atlantic Ocean obtained \n\nduring the cruise (first leg from Brazil to Africa coast). The sampling stations are indicated in \n\ngreen. The red and blue cores indicate warm anticyclonic and cold cyclonic eddies, respectively.  \n\n \n\nThe vertical distribution of chlorophyll-a throughout the first 50m is \n\nproportional to the vertical distribution of the functional absorption cross-section, \n\nespecially between 10 and 20\u00b0W (Figure 9), where an increase in chlorophyll-a \n\nconcentration was associated with higher ?PSII. This patch of increased biomass was \n\ncoincident with an increase in the relative proportion of diatoms, suggested by the \n\ndiagnostic pigment Fucoxanthin, also corroborated by data obtained with the FlowCam \n\n(data not shown). However, higher photochemical efficiency would be expected, along \n\nwith lower absorption cross-section. At DCM, the ratios of Fucoxanthin was also higher \n\nbetween 10 and 20\u00b0W. \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nFigure 9. Vertical section of Chlorophyll-a, Fv/Fm and ?PSII along the 35\u00b0S sector at the South \n\nAtlantic Ocean.  \n\n \n\nSector 3: Benguela upwelling  \n\nThe sector over the Benguela upwelling system shows low temperature waters \n\nreaching the surface over the continental shelf. Note however that the section of \n\ntransects was oriented from Cape Town southwards to complete the 35?S latitude line \n\nthat had to be interrupted in the first leg of the cruise (Figure 10).  Because of that, large \n\ngradients were observed in both temperature and salinity offshore, especially in the \n\nupper layers. In this sector, the highest chlorophyll-a concentrations were observed, \n\nreaching 8\u00b5gm-3, associated to the coldest waters. \n\n\n\n30 \n\nPositive relationships between Fv/Fm and temperature at the surface and \n\nbetween ?PSII and temperature at the DCM were observed. Thus, although the number of \n\nsamples is low to assign robust correlations, samples associated with the upwelled \n\nwaters tended to present low Fv/Fm and low ?PSII. \n\n \nFigure 10. Temperature and Salinity sections across the Benguela sector sampled during the \n\nsecond leg of the cruise. The map shows the stations track to highlight the southward direction of \n\nthis sampling. \n\n \n\nSector 4: Subtropical gyre at 30\u00baS and Brazil Current  \n\nThe sector crossed the Subtropical Gyre towards the 30\u00b0S at the Brazilian \n\ncoast, also intercepting the warm Brazil Current, between 30 and 40\u00b0W (Figure 11). \n\nPicnocline was deeper than in the 35\u00b0S sector, forcing the DCM deeper as well (about \n\n100m). Warm core eddies can be clearly observed at the SSH data from altimetry \n\n(Figure 12), which were probably originated at the Agulhas Current, especially at 5\u00b0W \n\nand 10\u00b0W.  \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \nFigure 11. Temperature and Salinity vertical sections across the subtropical Gyre sector sampled \n\nduring the second leg of the cruise.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 12.

The red and blue cores indicate warm anticyclonic and cold cyclonic eddies, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\nThe oligotrophic Gyre and Brazil Current waters were associated, as expected, \n\nwith low chlorophyll-a concentration (<0.2 mg m-3). The signal-to-noise ratio of the \n\n\n\n32 \n\nphoto-physiological derived data were extremely low at the surface with both Fv/Fm and \n\n?PSII values presented high coefficient of variation among fluorescence profiles of \n\nindividual samples (Figure 13). This led to the exclusion of the majority of the surface \n\nsamples by the quality control criteria applied (see methods). Low chlorophyll-a \n\nconcentrations were also observed in other sectors; however, the community \n\ncomposition was likely responsible for the noisy photo-physiological data at the surface \n\nof the subtropical gyre.  \n\n \nFigure 13. Relationship between the coefficient of variation among replicates of Fv/Fm and \n\nSigma measurements and chlorophyll-a concentration separated by sector and depth layers \n\n(surface and DCM).  \n\n \n\nThe highest Fv/Fmvalues were observed at the western side of the sector, while \n\n?PSII was consistent low across the DCM. Fv/Fm was positively related to the \n\ntemperature and salinity (r\u00b2=0.53 and 0.65, respectively), but the relationship (not \n\nshown) was linear above 18\u00b0C and salinity above 36, suggesting that the community \n\n\n\n33 \n\nwith better photosynthetic performance is influenced by the Brazil-Current waters at the \n\nwestern portion of this transect. This sector has also presented the highest proportions of \n\nDV-Chl at DCM, the diagnostic pigment of Prochlorococcus (Figure 5). \n\n \nFigure 14. Vertical section of chlorophyll-a concentration across the Subtropical Gyre in the \n\nSouth Atlantic Ocean \n\n \n\nIn our dataset, the chlorophyll-a concentration computed from the two methods, \n\nfluorimetric (Chl-a [fluorometry]) and HPLC (Chl-a [HPLC]), were highly correlated (see \n\nmethods), however 6% of the samples presented differences higher than 40% (Figure \n\n15), and 6 samples presented differences higher than two-fold. These results were \n\nindicated in the text and their interpretation should be careful. Nonetheless, differences \n\nwere found on the correlations analyses between pigments and photo-physiology \n\nparameters depending on the method (Tables 2 and 3). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nC\nh\nl-\n\na\n [\n\nH\nP\n\nL\nC\n\n] \n(m\n\ng\n m\n\n-3\n)\n\n0\n.1\n\n0\n.2\n\n0\n.3\n\n0\n.4\n\n0\n.5\n\n0\n.6\n\n0\n.7\n\n0\n.8\n\n0\n.9\n\n1\n.0\n\n1\n.1\n\n1\n.2\n\n1\n.3\n\n1\n.4\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\n\nSurface (r\u00b2=0.65)\n\nDCM (r\u00b2=0.78)\n\nLa Plata\n\nC\nh\n\nl-\na\n [\n\nH\nP\n\nL\nC\n\n] \n(m\n\ng\n m\n\n-3\n)\n\n0\n.0\n\n8\n0\n\n.0\n9\n\n0\n.1\n\n0\n\n0\n.2\n\n0\n\n0\n.3\n\n0\n\n0\n.4\n\n0\n\n0\n.5\n\n0\n\n0\n.6\n\n0\n0\n\n.7\n0\n\n0\n.8\n\n0\n0\n\n.9\n0\n\n1\n.0\n\n0\n\n2\n.0\n\n0\n\n0.08\n0.09\n0.10\n\n0.20\n\n0.30\n\n0.40\n\n0.50\n\n0.60\n0.70\n0.80\n0.90\n1.00\n\n2.00\n\n35\u00b0S\n\nSurface (r\u00b2=0.96)\n\nDCM (r\u00b2=0.77)\n\nOthers (r\u00b2=0.82)\n\n \n\nChl-a [fluorometry] (mg m-3)\n\nC\nh\n\nl-\na\n [\n\nH\nP\n\nL\nC\n\n] \n(m\n\ng\n m\n\n-3\n)\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\nSurface (r\u00b2=0.99)\n\nDCM (r\u00b2=0.10)\n\nOthers (r\u00b2=0.99)\n\nBenguela\n\nChl-a [fluorometry] (mg m-3)\n\nC\nh\nl-\n\na \n[H\n\nP\nL\n\nC\n] \n\n(m\ng\n m\n\n-3\n)\n\n0\n.0\n\n2\n\n0\n.0\n\n3\n\n0\n.0\n\n4\n\n0\n.0\n\n5\n0\n.0\n\n6\n0\n.0\n\n7\n0\n.0\n\n8\n0\n.0\n\n9\n0\n.1\n\n0\n\n0\n.2\n\n0\n\n0\n.3\n\n0\n\n0\n.4\n\n0\n\n0\n.5\n\n0\n0\n.6\n\n0\n0\n.7\n\n0\n0\n.8\n\n0\n0\n.9\n\n0\n1\n.0\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n0.06\n0.07\n0.08\n0.09\n0.10\n\n0.20\n\n0.30\n\n0.40\n\n0.50\n0.60\n0.70\n0.80\n0.90\n1.00\n\nGyre\n\nSurface (r\u00b2=0.76)\n\nDCM (r\u00b2=0.44)\n\nOthers (r\u00b2=0.83)\n\n \nFigure 15.  Comparison between the chlorophyll-a concentrations from two methods: HPLC and \n\nFluorometry (Welschmeyer 1994) separated by sectors in the South Atlantic Ocean \n\n \n\n3.2. Fv/Fm versus ?PSII in large spatial scales \n\nFv/Fmand ?PSII were not significantly correlated when the data from all sectors \n\nwere polled together, however some trends were observed according to distinct depth \n\nlayers, especially in the large transects, where high vertical resolution data were \n\ncollected (35\u00b0S and Gyre) (Figure 16). Contrasting these two sectors, ?PSII presented a \n\nnarrower range of variability at the Gyre sector and a clear trend of correlation between \n\nFv/Fm and ?PSII in deeper waters. Indeed, at DCM, they were positively correlated in this \n\nsector (r2=0.37, p<0.01), which is opposite to what it has been previously seen (Moore \n\net al. 2005, Suggett et al. 2009). However, at DCM, the Chl-b proportion (also DV-Chl) \n\n\n\n35 \n\nsuggested the presence of Prochlorococcus. At surface waters of the oligotrophic gyre, \n\nhigher proportion of Zeaxanthin compared to the 35\u00b0S sector, suggests the important \n\ncontribution of Synechococcus, that summed to the low biomass, generated the noisy \n\nphoto-physiological data. At 35\u00b0S, Zeaxanthin and DV-Chl were lower, followed by a \n\nsignificant increase in Hex-Fucoxanthin ratios, both at surface and DCM.  \n\nFigure 16. Relationship between ?PSII and Fv/Fm for two sectors in the Subtropical South Atlantic \n\nOcean where high vertical resolution data were obtained. The data presented here are samples \n\nfrom 4 to 5 depths in the water column (not only surface and DCM). \n\n \n\nThe averages of Fv/Fm and ?PSII and their respective standard deviations give a \n\nsummary of how these two parameters vary and relate to one another among sectors, \n\nalso showing their dynamic ranges (Figure 17). The La Plata and Benguela sectors \n\npresented similar ranges Fv/Fm, but ?PSII was higher for the Benguela sector in both \n\nsurface and DCM. According with the pigment ratios (Figure 5), the La Plata sector \n\nshowed important contribution of Fucoxanthin (i.e., marker of diatoms) near coast, \n\nwhile the stations near coast in the Benguela sector presented important contributions of \n\nthe combination Fucoxanthin, Hex-Fucoxanthin and But-Fucoxanthin, that are marker \n\npigments of diatoms and haptophytes. \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\nFigure 17.

Relationships between photo-physiological parameters and pigment ratios and \n\nbetween photo-physiological parameters and bulk bio-optical indices across different \n\noceanographic features \n\nOur approach was to investigate to what extent the accessory pigments can \n\nexplain the variability observed in the photo-physiological parameters Fv/Fm and ?PSII in \n\nlarge scale. The pigments ratios to the total of accessory pigments were correlated to the \n\nphoto-physiology parameters, including the primary and the auxiliary set of pigments \n\n(e.g., Violaxanthin and Neoxanthin). In our dataset, the proportion of the diagnostic \n\n\n\n37 \n\npigments (Fucoxanthin, But-Fucoxanthin, Hex-Fucoxanthin, Peridin, Alloxanthin, Chl-\n\nb and Zeaxanthin) to the total of accessory pigments was about 70% (except for the \n\nSubtropical Gyre sector that was about 75%), so the other 30% of \u201cnon-diagnostic\u201d \n\npigments were considered in the analyses. \n\nThe pigments ratios that showed relationships with Fv/Fm and ?PSII varied \n\namong the sectors, with important contribution of some photo-protective pigments, \n\nbesides the exclusive diagnostic pigments. Individual photo-protective and \n\nphotosynthetic pigments have shown important correlations to Fv/Fm and ?PSII, but in \n\nsome cases, the commonly used physiological indices, PSC and PPC, were not \n\nsignificantly correlated to photo-physiology. For example, at DCM of the 35\u00b0S sector, \n\nthe proportions of Alloxanthin, Diatoxanthin and Diadinoxanthin were significantly \n\nrelated to Fv/Fm, however the pool of photo-protective carotenoids (PPC) was not \n\nsignificant. \n\nIn the La Plata sector, Fv/Fm was positively correlated to Chl c3 at the surface \n\nand negatively correlated to Diadinoxanthin and, in less extent, to the proportion of \n\nViolaxanthin (Table 2). In this case, PPC was also significantly correlated to Fv/Fm at the \n\nsurface (r\u00b2=0.87). At DCM, Fv/Fm was correlated with the chlorophyll-a concentration. \n\nAlthough the higher values of Fv/Fm was related to higher phytoplankton biomass and \n\nlower ?PSII at DCM, which suggested the presence of diatoms, the proportion of \n\nFucoxanthin, a diagnostic pigment of this group, was not significantly related to Fv/Fm. \n\n?PSII was correlated to Fucoxanthin ratios at DCM, as well as the photo-protective \n\ncarotenoids Alloxanthin and Lutein. At the surface, ?PSII was negatively correlated to \n\nChl c2 and positively correlated to ??-Carotene ratios (Table 3).  \n\nTable 2.

However, photo-protective pigments have shown an \n\nimportant role on Fv/Fm variability in both layers (Table 2). The packaging index S(f) \n\nwas also correlated to the both photo-physiological parameters, and the best descriptor \n\nof Fv/Fm at DCM. In addition, Fv/Fm was negatively correlated to the proportion of \n\ndegradation product of chlorophyll (Chlide/TChl-a). ?PSII, on the other hand, was \n\nprimarily explained by the variability of Fucoxanthin, a diagnostic pigment of diatoms, \n\nand in less extent by Hex-Fucoxanthin and Lutein (Table 3). At DCM, the proportion of \n\nChl c2 and c3 were also correlated to ?PSII. As Fucoxanthin and the accessory \n\nchlorophylls presented a positive impact on ?PSII, and Hex-Fucoxanthin and Lutein \n\nshow the opposite, the direct effect of the taxonomic groups on ?PSII at this sector is not \n\nclear. In addition, the Fucoxanthin is a diagnostic pigment of diatoms, however is not \n\nexclusive, being present in several other groups. Much of the variability could be \n\nexplained by the community size, however S(f) shows that higher ?PSII would be related \n\nto larger cells, which is opposed to what is expected (Giannini and Ciotti 2016). The \n\nrelationship between Fv/Fmand Chlide/TChla suggests the presence of senescent cells \n\nbetween 10 and 20\u00b0W at this sector, where an increase in biomass was observed. \n\nVertical sections of Fucoxanthin ratios and the FlowCam data from the surface (not \n\nshown) suggested that this community would be dominated by large diatoms. \n\nThe photo-physiology data at the Benguela sector were influenced by the \n\npigments composition only at DCM. Fv/Fm was negatively and positively correlated to \n\nthe photosynthetic pigments Mg-DVP and Fucoxanthin, respectively, while ?PSII was \n\nnegatively correlated to S(f). The Mg-DVP is an accessory pigment present in most of \n\n\n\n40 \n\nthe phytoplankton groups, usually with small contribution, however important in the \n\ngreen algae of the group Prasinophyte. \n\nIn the subtropical oligotrophic gyre, complex relationships between photo-\n\nphysiology and pigments proportion were observed at DCM. As mentioned before, this \n\nsector had a greater contribution of Prochlorococcus and the proportion of DV-Chla \n\nand Chl-b, as well as the fraction of picoplankton (Uitz et al. 2006) were significantly \n\ncorrelated to Fv/Fm, suggesting a positive contribution of this group to the \n\nphotochemical efficiency of the community, especially in the western basin. An \n\nimportant contribution of ??-Carotene in Fv/Fm variability was observed. In addition, \n\nlower Fv/Fm values are driven by the presence of Chl c2, Hex-Fucoxanthin, Peridin and \n\nLutein, which was expressed by the negative impact of PSC in Fv/Fm (Table 2). \n\nTherefore, a mixed phytoplankton community seemed to be related to the lower \n\nphotochemical efficiency at the eastern basin of the gyre. ?PSII was negatively correlated \n\nto the proportions of Zeaxanthin and Lutein (Table 3), suggesting this parameter is \n\nmainly controlled by the presence of Synechococcus.  \n\n4. Discussion \n\n4.1. The role of pigments ratios in the phytoplankton community photo-physiology in \n\nlarge-scale process  \n\nThe amount of information about photo-physiological parameters of natural \n\nphytoplankton derived from chlorophyll-a fluorescence at large spatial scale has \n\nincreased in the last decade. A number of studies include observations derived from \n\ndifferent oceanographic conditions: phytoplankton blooms (Moore et al. 2005; Suggett \n\net al. 2006); mesoscale eddies (Bibby et al. 2008); Southern Ocean waters (Holeton et \n\nal. 2005; Suggett et al. 2009; Lin et al. 2016); tropical and subtropical Pacific and \n\nAtlantic waters (e.g. Behrenfeld et al. 2006; Moore et al. 2008; Browning et al. 2014, \n\n\n\n41 \n\nLin et al. 2016); shelf and coastal waters (Moore et al. 2006; Suggett et al. 2009). The \n\nvariability found in these results encourages the search for patterns and for better \n\ninterpretations of photo-physiology. \n\nThe studies above have discussed the influence of environmental variables and \n\nphytoplankton community structure in Fv/Fm and ?PSII. These parameters, especially \n\nFv/Fm, have historically described physiological stress driven by nutrient limitation \n\n(Cleveland and Perry 1987; Kolber et al. 1988; Geider et al. 1993, Behrenfeld 2006), \n\nhowever, other studies showed that natural communities are able to acclimate to \n\nnutrients-limitation conditions  (Parkhill et al. 2001) making the response of photo-\n\nphysiology more significantly related to phytoplankton taxonomy and dominant cell \n\nsize (Moore et al. 2008, Suggett et al. 2009; Chapter 3 - now published as Giannini and \n\nCiotti 2016), that at first order varies according with the dynamics of a given \n\nenvironment (Cullen et al. 2002). Although phytoplankton community structure is \n\nexpected to drive the variability of both Fv/Fm and ?PSII, and also the relationship \n\nbetween each other at least for eukaryotes, the data of the present work show no \n\nconsistency across large-scale oceanographic regions. \n\nThe photo-physiology of phytoplankton in the South Atlantic Ocean is still \n\npoorly studied. Recently, Browing et al. (2014) in the mid-austral summer sampled a \n\nline of stations in 40\u00b0S latitude across the Subtropical Front, demonstrating that the \n\nvariability of phytoplankton physiology was controlled by nutrients dynamics, which \n\nsuggested limitation by iron in the eastern basin (south of the subtropical front), and by \n\nthe balanced macronutrient-limited growth in the western basin (north of the \n\nconvergence). The authors found unexpected relationships between Fv/Fm and the \n\nfractional contribution of some individual diagnostic pigments, such as Hex-\n\nFucoxanthin and Zeaxanthin. The present study was conducted also in the mid-austral \n\n\n\n42 \n\nsummer along the 35\u00b0S and subtropical gyre, and the results showed robust \n\nrelationships among photo-physiological parameters (Fv/Fm and ?PSII) and a series of \n\nindividual pigments ratios, assuming linearity (?=0.05). Fv/Fm vertical profile across the \n\neastern basin of the transect at 35\u00b0S was similar to the distribution and magnitudes \n\nfound by Browing et al. (2014). \n\nThe comparison between the three zonal sectors in the present study reveals a \n\ngreater influence of individual photo-protective carotenoids in the variability of Fv/Fm at \n\nthe 35\u00b0S latitude, while the relationship with the PPC index was not significant in this \n\nsector. The significant pigment ratios were mainly those involved in the epoxide cycle \n\n(Violaxanthin, Diatoxanthin, Diadinoxanthin) that varies enormously according to the \n\nprevious light history of the algae (Lohr 2011). The physical processes along this sector \n\npromote vertical instabilities driven by eddies, which may bring nutrients to the \n\neuphotic zone but expose the phytoplankton community to higher light levels, \n\nexplaining the importance of some photo-protective pigments in Fv/Fm. In the \n\nSubtropical Gyre, the main driver of Fv/Fmvariability were the photosynthetic pigments, \n\nsome of them diagnostic of specific taxonomical groups. In this sector, different from \n\nthe 35\u00b0S, the water column was stratified and the chlorophyll-a concentration was \n\nconfined at the DCM, with very low biomass along the euphotic layer. Interestingly, the \n\nvariability of the functional absorption cross-section at 35\u00b0W was mainly driven by a \n\nmixture of photosynthetic and photo-protective pigments (some of them diagnostic of \n\nspecific groups), while at the DCM of the gyre, the significant pigments were not \n\nphotosynthetic. \n\nDifferences between surface and deep chlorophyll maximum layers must be \n\ninvestigated with caution, since light and nutrients acclimation processes take place at \n\nthe DCM, depending on the nitracline depth and euphotic depth (see Cullen et al. 2015 \n\n\n\n43 \n\nand references therein). The variability of chlorophyll-a concentration with depth do not \n\nalways represent variability in biomass or carbon content, due to the photo-acclimation \n\nprocesses and differences in nutrients availability (Cullen 1982). Pigment ratios, \n\nhowever, can be helpful to understand the differences in photo-physiology at surface \n\nand at the DCM.  Across the 35\u00b0S sector, where it is possible to contrast surface and \n\nDCM layers in large vertical and horizontal scale, the influence of photoprotective \n\npigments on Fv/Fm was similar at the surface and DCM, except for the contribution of \n\nChl c3 ratios at DCM, however less significant, and the importance of Chlide/TChla and \n\nS(f). Chl c2 and c3 appeared as important pigments to explain ?PSII variability, which can \n\nbe related to specific groups, although we believe the presence of Chl c, in general, can \n\nbe also related to degradation products, as well as the Chlide/TChla (Jeffrey et al. 1984), \n\nwhich will be discussed later.  \n\nThe La Plata sector presented the expected relationship between taxonomy and \n\ncell size and the phytoplankton photo-physiology (Suggett et al. 2009):  high \n\nchlorophyll-a concentrations and diagnostic pigments for diatoms, with higher \n\nphotosynthetic efficiency and lower ?PSII, were observed in low salinity waters; along \n\nthe gradient of salinity, chlorophyll-a decreased, as did the photosynthetic efficiency, \n\nwhile ?PSII increased. We expected to observe this same pattern in the Benguela sector, \n\nsince costal upwelling would drive higher phytoplankton biomass and force community \n\nstructure gradients from coast to open ocean as reported in previous studies (Fishwick et \n\nal. 2006, Lamont et al. 2014). However, the influence of the Benguela current upwelling \n\nappeared weak in our dataset (see Silio-Calzada et al. 2008).  \n\n4.2. The contribution of Prochlorococcus to photophysiology in the subtropical \n\noligotrophic gyre \n\n\n\n44 \n\n The distribution of photosynthetic pigments at the Subtropical Gyre sector was \n\nrelated to the contribution of Prochlorococcus at the DCM of this transect, which is \n\nlikely responsible for higher photosynthetic performance at this layer, contrasting with \n\nthe lower photochemical efficiency of the flagellates from the group haptophytes.  \n\nSome of its photosynthetic properties may give Prochlorococcus a definite selective \n\nadvantage for growth at depth in oligotrophic areas, particularly compared to \n\nSynechococcus (Partenski et al 1999). Here we have shown a better photosynthetic \n\nperformance of this group at DCM compared to the small haptophytes cells, that were \n\nidentified by the HPLC analysis. The presence of Prochlorococcus and Haptophytes \n\nwere also observed by Araujo (2015), that sampled this longitudinal transect at the same \n\nperiod. The authors also confirmed the presence of Synechococcus, besides the \n\nProchlorococcus at the surface.  \n\nProchlorococcus is the dominant group in the tropical and subtropical oceans, \n\nbeing part of the most abundant marine picocyanobacteria groups in the worlds ocean, \n\nand are important contributors to the global primary production and carbon cycle \n\n(Partenski et al. 1999; Huang et al. 2012). Although currently reconized as a single type \n\nspecies (Prochlorococcus marinus; Chisholm et al. 1992; Guiry and Guiry 2016), to \n\ndate, at least 11 Prochlorococcus lineages have been identified, among them clades \n\nadapted to high and low light (Huang et al. 2012). These authors suggested that low-\n\nlight adapted genotypes could be more diverse than high-light adapted ones. Recent \n\nbiochemical studies suggest that different Prochlorococcus strains may have different \n\nantenna systems specifically adapted to the light environment from which they have \n\nbeen isolated (Partenski et al. 1997). As far as we know there is no specific studies about \n\nthe differences in the photochemical efficiency of PSII and the effective cross-section of \n\nlight absorption for distinct ecotypes in natural environments, for both Prochlorococcus \n\n\n\n45 \n\nand Synechococcus, and it is reasonable to suggest that different ecotypes or genotypes \n\nmight have contrasting photosynthetic performances across large spatial scale in the \n\nglobal oceans, being a subject that deserves further studies.  \n\nThe higher efficiency of Prochlorococcus has been discussed, and they were \n\nshown to have high values of Fv/Fm and low ?PSII, following the relationships observed \n\nfor eukaryotes (Suggett et al. 2009). Compared to other cyanobacteria groups, the \n\nProchlorococcus have low amount of phycoerythrin acting as photosynthetic pigment \n\n(Steglich et al. 2003), as well as 3-times lower RCI:RCII (Partenski et al. 1997), which \n\nlead to the photo-physiology to behave similarly to the eukaryotes groups. Also, \n\nProchlorococcus appears highly adapted for growth in a nutrient impoverished \n\nenvironment (see discussion in Moore et al. 2008). There is, however, scarce \n\ninformation on photophysiological properties of DV-Chls and \n\nProchlorococcus phycoerythrin (Steglich et al. 2003). Thus, our dataset contributes for \n\nthe interpretation of large-scale variability and characteristics of the photo-physiology \n\nof this group that is still undersampled.  \n\n4.3. Senescence diatoms after a mesoscale upwelling and their photophysiology \n\nThe importance of photo-protective pigments at 35\u00b0S were observed at both \n\nsurface and DCM, but the ratio Chlide/TChl-a was inversely correlated to Fv/Fm at \n\nDCM. Indeed, vertical profiles have shown this index of degradation products have \n\nincreased between 10 and 20\u00b0W, coincident with the higher biomass at the center of the \n\neddy, elevated proportions of Fucoxanthin and lower Fv/Fm values. The same increase in \n\nFucoxanthin at this portion of the sector was also observed by Browing et al. (2014) that \n\nsampled the same region two months later. The decrease in photosynthetic efficiency \n\ncould then be related to the presence of senescent diatoms, suggested by the presence of \n\nchlorophyllide-a derived from chlorophyllase activity (Jeffrey 1974). That implies a \n\n\n\n46 \n\nrapid process of inactivity in the photosynthetic apparatus after nutrients exhaustion, \n\nand samples presented high chlorophyll-a (pigment-containing cells) and high ?PSII. The \n\nresponses of both Fv/Fm and ?PSII in this region to a physiological stress resembles what \n\nis usually observed in batch cultures after nutrients depletion at the stationary phase \n\n(Kolber et al. 1988; Parkhill et al. 2001; Suggett et al. 2009). Bibby et al. (2008) have \n\nalso observed lower Fv/Fm and higher ?PSII at the center of mesoscale eddies, although \n\nphoto-physiological responses seem to be specific to the eddy type, location and its \n\nstage of development. The physiological response of Fv/Fm and ?PSII in this small \n\nportion of the 35\u00b0S sector, probably due to the intensity of the bloom, seemed to happen \n\nin shorter time scale than compared to a taxonomic effect. A senescent community of \n\ndiatoms in this region could explain the observed negative relationship between ?PSII \n\nand the S(f) index, which is opposite to what is expected: large cells are expected to have \n\nlower ?PSII, as well as lower S(f). Here, lower S(f) values (i.e. low absorption efficiency) \n\nwas associated to higher ?PSII and lower Fv/Fm. Although trends with cell size are clear \n\n(Ciotti et al. 2002), pigment packaging and concentration can also vary with the \n\nphysiological state of the community, and might affect such expected relationship.  \n\nThere are few studies showing direct effects of senescent communities on the \n\nphotosynthetic efficiency as measured by the PSII fluorescence. Franklin et al. (2009) \n\nhave shown that the PSII efficiency declines non-linearly with the increase in the \n\nproportion of heat-killed cells in a laboratory experiment. Veldhuis et al. (2001) also \n\nobserved a decrease in photosynthetic activity of different laboratory-grown species \n\nwith the decrease in cells viability just prior to full cell degradation and, according to \n\nthese authors, the fact that non-viable cells still possess their photopigments allows clear \n\nidentification in mixed communities, which could be used in field research. Our results \n\ncorroborate such idea in the sense that senescent communities originated from \n\n\n\n47 \n\nenvironmental stress, in this case nutrients exhaustion, are photosynthetically inactive \n\nbut have pigment-containing cells, which can be observed by the chlorophyll-a profile \n\nat this section. Interestingly, the longitudinal profile at 40\u00b0S from Browing et al. (2014) \n\nshows relatively high density of total heterotrophic bacteria between 10 and 20\u00b0W \n\nsampled two months later than our sampling, which might suggest an intense \n\nconsumption of the degradation products and dissolved excreted material.  \n\nIn summary, the relationships discussed here aim to identify trends between \n\npigment ratios and photo-physiology in order to assess the impacts of phytoplankton \n\ncommunities and photo-acclimation processes simultaneously on photosynthetic and \n\nabsorption efficiencies at different large scale oceanographic regions. Although the \n\nchosen linear correlations resulted in low coefficients of determination, the existence of \n\nsignificant correlations are considered important results for the objectives of the study, \n\nthat did not aim to construct predictive models. Such low predictive power can be \n\nrelated to non-linearity of relationships and the short dynamic ranges of photo-\n\nphysiological data in some of the sectors studied here, e.g. in the oligotrophic gyre.  \n\nSome of the pigments that are considered as tertiary pigments in HPLC \n\nanalysis and round-robin intercalibrations, such as the Violaxanthin, Prasinoxanthin and \n\nLutein (Van Heukelen and Hooker 2011), presented their proportions significantly \n\nimportant and related to photo-physiological parameters in our study. Tertiary pigments \n\nare not among the most commonly measured pigments, however we show they might be \n\nimportant to help explaining some patterns in photo-physiology of natural \n\nphytoplankton communities exposed to contrasting environmental conditions.  \n\nAs phytoplankton pigments composition provides a useful information on \n\ntaxonomy, but also physiological state and, as shown here, photochemical and light \n\nabsorption efficiencies, it can be a powerful tool to directly monitor potential primary \n\n\n\n48 \n\nproduction in large-scale and improve future parameterizations. As the signature of \n\ndominant cell size is also clear in previous work and through some indexes presented \n\nhere, the pigments composition from different cell size classes would significantly \n\ncontribute to the assessment of primary production dynamics in the ocean, using a more \n\ndirect and non-invasive method, such as the chlorophyll-a fluorescence technique.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\nParameterization of natural phytoplankton photo-physiology: Effects of cell size \n\nand nutrient concentration \n\n1. Introduction \n\nMeasuring carbon primary production in the ocean is extremely challenging due \n\nto constraints that range from methodological issues, especially those associated with \n\nsample incubation (Bender et al. 1987; Grande et al. 1989; Marra 2002) and \n\nuncertainties in respiration and other metabolic rates (Bender et al. 1999; Williams et al. \n\n2002), which can limit primary production measurements in large spatial and temporal \n\nscales. Consequently, non-invasive methods for measuring primary production in the \n\noceans have been proposed and become increasingly popular among oceanographers, \n\nbased on the flow of electrons through photosystem II (PSII) that can be measured by \n\nactive fluorescence emitted from chlorophyll-a (Falkowski et al. 1986; Kolber and \n\nFalkowski 1993).  \n\nActive fluorometers are able to yield values of electron transfer rates (ETR) \n\noccurring during the photosynthetic process (Kolber and Falkowski 1993; Suggett et al. \n\n2003; Oxborough et al. 2012) that can subsequently be converted into an estimate of \n\ncarbon uptake (e.g. Lawrenz et al. 2013). Computation of ETR requires specific \n\nparameters obtained from fluorimetric measurements, including the PSII photochemical \n\nefficiency (?PSII), under low and regulated actinic light, and the functional absorption \n\ncross-section of PSII (?PSII) (Kolber and Falkowski 1993). Active fluorescence yields \n\nfrom dark-acclimated samples, or under low light conditions, typically provide the \n\nmaximal photochemical efficiency (?PSII\nmax or Fv/Fm), while the effective \n\nphotochemical efficiency (?PSII? or Fq?/Fm?) is measured under regulated actinic light. \n\n\n\n50 \n\nSuch fluorescence techniques have been widely used and improved in the last years \n\n(e.g. Oxborough et al. 2012), providing measurements of photochemical parameters at \n\ndifferent temporal and spatial scales, and are thus a promising technique to better \n\nexamine primary production in aquatic environments. \n\nPhoto-physiological parameters such as Fv/Fm and ?PSII are used to evaluate the \n\nphotosynthetic performance of different phytoplankton species and their growth \n\nconditions, but also reflect the environmental history and responses of selective pressure \n\nof evolution (Suggett et al. 2009a). It is therefore fundamental to understand the \n\nvariability of such parameters in the ocean and how they relate to environmental \n\nconditions and the phytoplankton community distribution and, consequently, how they \n\nimpact on primary production estimates of marine ecosystems. In natural communities, \n\nphytoplankton photosynthetic rates vary in response to physical forcing acting over a \n\nwide range of temporal and spatial scales. As ambient nutrient availability plays an \n\nessential role in Fv/Fm and ?PSII variability, their relationships have been studied \n\nextensively (e.g. Behrenfeld et al. 2006; Bibby et al. 2008; Rattan et al. 2012). During \n\nnutrient limitation, phytoplankton cells typically exhibit an increased ?PSII and \n\nconcurrent decrease in Fv/Fm, arising from a loss of functional PSII reaction centers \n\nrelative to the proportion of antenna complexes (Greene et al. 1992; Suggett et al. \n\n2009a). However, laboratory experiments exposing cells to prolonged nutrient \n\nlimitation, demonstrate that these impacts can be minimized via acclimation and \n\nmaintenance of balanced growth (Parkhill et al. 2001); thus in natural conditions where \n\nnutrient limitation persists (e.g. Moore et al. 2013) physiological effects of nutrient-\n\nlimitation are not as strong as taxonomic differences (Suggett et al. 2009a). Conversely, \n\nsuch trends may not be clear where cells may be episodically subjected to periods of \n\n\n\n51 \n\nnutrient limitation, transient nutrient exposure and nutrient starvation, resulting in \n\npersistent unbalanced growth (Rattan et al. 2012).  \n\nBesides the impacts of environmental condition on both Fv/Fm and ?PSII, several \n\nstudies have demonstrated the influence of phytoplankton cell size and taxonomy on \n\nmeasurements of variable fluorescence, and hence on their photosynthetic rates (Suggett \n\net al. 2004; Suggett et al. 2009b; Rattan et al. 2012; Moore et al. 2005). Specifically, \n\nwhilst lower Fv/Fm and increased ?PSII occurs via nutrient starvation, the same response \n\nalso occurs via taxonomic changes under nutrient limitation: the small cells that are \n\nfavored in low-nutrient environments exhibit lower Fv/Fm and higher ?PSII values than \n\nlarger cells (Fishwick et al. 2006; Suggett et al. 2009a). Variability of pigment \n\nconcentration inside the cell appears to govern this trend (Suggett et al. 2004, 2009a; \n\nMoore et al. 2005; Blache et al. 2011). Therefore, influence of dominant cell size on the \n\nlight absorption properties is a key factor (Ciotti et al. 2002, Uitz et al. 2008), such that \n\ncommunity structure-driven changes in light harvesting likely plays a major role in \n\ninfluencing the maximum achievable ETR and carbon assimilation rates. \n\nDespite the community structure influence on photo-physiology, choosing \n\nrepresentative taxonomic-specific parameterizations of primary production models is an \n\nextremely difficult task, especially in coastal waters, where local hydrodynamics can \n\nlead to changes in the composition of phytoplankton communities on a time scale of \n\nhours to days. As an alternative to taxonomic-specific classification, natural \n\ncommunities can be classified into discrete groups according to dominant cell size \n\n(sensu Sieburth et al. 1978), still reflecting key environmental conditions, such as \n\nnutrient variability (Cullen 2002). Indeed, the relationship between cell size, photo-\n\nphysiology and metabolism has been widely examined in the last few years (Suggett et \n\nal. 2009a; Lopez-Sandoval et al. 2014; Mara\u00f1on et al. 2015). Therefore, understanding \n\n\n\n52 \n\nthe impacts of dominant cell size upon photo-physiology and ETR, and their subsequent \n\nconversion to estimates of carbon assimilation, is an essential step towards improving \n\nprimary production models derived from active fluorometry. \n\n The main goal of this study was to examine for the first time the relationship \n\nbetween the dominant size of natural phytoplankton communities and variability of \n\nphoto-physiological parameters, i.e. Fv/Fm and ?PSII, considering different ambient \n\nnutrients conditions. The study area included two sites of contrasting nutrient \n\navailability in a meso-oligotrophic coastal region in southeastern Brazil: a small and \n\nshallow bay and the adjacent deeper and advective channel (Figure 1) that were sampled \n\non scales of days and months. As the bay exchanges water with the channel due to the \n\ntidal cycle, and nutrient concentration is consistently higher in the bay, the sampling \n\ndesign allowed discrimination of the effects of different levels of nutrient availability \n\nfrom cell size on the parameterization of fluorimetric photo-physiology. \n\n2. Theoretical background \n\nFor a given phytoplankton cell, the relationship between fluorescence and \n\nphotosynthesis rates can be developed as function of the relative efficiencies between \n\nthese processes at PSII. Kolber and Falkowski (1993) proposed a model that associates \n\nthe active PSII fluorescence emitted by samples containing live cells with the first step \n\nof electron transfer during the photosynthetic process. Measurements of electron \n\ntransfer rates at PSII (ETRPSII) allow the estimation of carbon uptake rates by \n\nphytoplankton (Pc) according to: \n\nPc = ETRPSII ? ?e ? PQ\n?1  ,                                                    (1) \n\nwhere?e is the ratio of electrons transferred per O2 molecule produced during \n\nphotosynthesis (mol O2 (mol electron)\n-1) and PQ (photosynthetic quotient) is the ratio \n\nbetween produced O2 and fixed CO2 (mol O2 (mol C)\n-1). ETRPSII is a function of photo-\n\n\n\n53 \n\nphysiological parameters, i.e., the effective light absorption (?PSII) and the \n\nphotochemical efficiency of PSII (?PSII), and it is given by: \n\nETRPSII =  ?PSII ? ?PSII ? E ? ?RC       ,                                                    (2) \n\nwhere ?PSII is dimensionless, ?PSII is given in m\n2(RCII)-1 and E is the available \n\nirradiance (mol photons m-2 s-1). Both ?PSII and ?PSII can be directly measured from \n\nresponses in active fluorescence (Kolber and Falkowski 1993; Kromkamp and Forster \n\n2003). ?RC represents the quantum yield of electron transfer within the reaction center, \n\nwhich is constant and assumed to be unity (i.e. one electron is transferred per quanta \n\nabsorbed and delivered to the reaction center). The fluorometer used in this study \n\ndelivers excitation centered at 452nm, with a 30nm bandwidth, therefore the term ?PSII \n\nis replaced by ?PSII(452) hereafter. \n\nIn order to compute ETRPSII light-response curves, as equivalent to a \n\nphotosynthesis-light curve (Jassby and Platt, 1976), ?PSII is measured across a gradient \n\nof light steps (?PSII? or Fq?/Fm?), after a dark-step (?PSII\nmax or Fv/Fm), which also \n\nprovides ?PSII(452) for both conditions. However, measurements of ?PSII(452) can be \n\nextremely noisy under high actinic light conditions (see Oxborough et al. 2012), which \n\nindeed we observed in our dataset; and we therefore used an alternative ETRPSII model \n\nthat employs ?PSII(452) measured on dark-acclimated samples (Suggett et al. 2010). As \n\nsuch ETRPSII at each light step of light-response curves were computed as follows: \n\nETRPSII = ?PSII(452) ?\n???/???\n\n??/??\n?  E                                                        (3) \n\nThe maximal photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) was obtained after at least 20 \n\nminutes of dark-acclimation of the samples, in order to relax the energy-dependent non-\n\nphotochemical quenching (i.e. the dissipation of absorbed excitation energy as heat), \n\nwhile the effective photochemical efficiency (Fq?/Fm?) was measured from fluorescence \n\ntransients obtained under actinic light and represents the product of non-photochemical \n\n\n\n54 \n\nquenching and the efficiency of photochemical charge separation. ETRPSII light curves \n\nwere computed as averages of three replicates. Details of the protocol used in this work \n\nto obtain the fluorescence transients and the light curves parameters are found on \n\nMethods section. \n\nVolumetric calculation of ETRPSII, i.e., in mol electron m\n-3 h-1, also requires \n\nknowledge of number of functional reaction centers per chlorophyll-a (nPSII). Because \n\ndirect measurements of nPSII are notoriously difficult to perform in the field, many \n\nstudies have assumed a fixed value (nPSII=1/500; Kolber and Falkowski 1993), despite \n\nevidences that nPSII varies across different phytoplankton taxa and growth conditions \n\n(Suggett et al. 2010; Oxborough et al. 2012). Finally, the conversion of volume-based \n\nETRPSII into carbon fixation estimates must also consider the \u201celectron requirement for \n\ncarbon fixation\u201d (?e:c) (see Lawrenz et al. 2013) describing the efficiency with which \n\nelectrons are invested into CO2 fixation, which is also non-linear (Ralph et al. 2010). \n\n3. Methods \n\n3.1. Study region and sampling design \n\nThe study was conducted in the S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o channel (SSC), a coastal region \n\noff S\u00e3o Paulo state in Brazil (Figure 1), where the regional hydrography is primarily \n\ncontrolled by remote winds, frontal systems and localized coastal upwelling events \n\n(Ciotti et al. 2014). The low year-round nutrient concentrations at SSC are modified by \n\nintrusions of the SACW (South Atlantic Central Water) during upwelling events off \n\nUbatuba, located nearby the northern entrance of the SSC (Castro 2014), which would \n\ninfluence the primary production rates in this region via nutrient inputs (Saldanha-\n\nCorr\u00eaa and Gianesella 2008). Nevertheless, more recent studies show that the effects of \n\nthe SACW in the channel are limited to the deep layers (Dottori et al. 2015) and that \n\nepisodic nutrient enrichment occurs during the passage of frontal systems (Peres, 2013).  \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \nFigure 1. a. Study area located at the coastal region off S\u00e3o Paulo State in Brazil. The symbol \u2018x\u2019 \n\nindicates the two samplings areas: S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o Channel (SSC) and Ara\u00e7\u00e1 Bay. b. Seasonality \n\nof water masses at the surface and bottom of S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o coastal waters (Modified from Cerda \n\n&amp; Castro, 2014). CW=Coastal Water; TW=Tropical Water; SACW=South Atlantic Central \n\nWater. The colourbars represent the water mass proportions (above 0.5) for each depth layer, \n\nderived from temperature and salinity indexes, according to Cerda &amp; Castro (2014). The black \n\narrow and the circle indicate the location of the S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o Channel. \n\n \n\nPrevious studies carried out in the S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o channel and adjacent \n\ncontinental shelf waters have shown generally low dissolved inorganic nutrient \n\nconcentrations, due to the water masses that flow into the channel as well as for the \n\nrelatively low continental runoff, which characterizes this region as meso-oligotrophic \n\n(Saldanha-Corr\u00eaa and Gianesella 2008). Nutrient analysis has revealed low nitrate \n\nconcentrations, resulting in N:P ratios in general below 16:1, even for the deeper waters, \n\nwhere the influence of SACW upwelling occurs during spring months (Gianesella et al. \n\n1999; Gaeta et al. 1999; Peres 2013, Saldanha-Corr\u00eaa 1993). Among those studies, the \n\naverage nitrate, phosphate and silicate concentrations were below 10, 1 and 10 \u00b5mol/L, \n\n\n\n56 \n\nrespectively, where the highest values of nitrate (above 5\u00b5mol/L) were usually found at \n\nbottom waters of SSC during spring or summer (Gianesella et al. 1999; Peres 2013). \n\nIn the current work, three-days sampling surveys were carried out approximately \n\nevery month from September 2013 to August 2014. The samples were collected at two \n\ndifferent sites that were visited twice a day (morning and afternoon), to give \n\napproximately 12 samplings per survey. One site was located in the S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o \n\nchannel (SSC), near the CEBIMar/USP oceanographic buoy (14 m depth, \n\nhttp://www.simcosta.furg.br/portal/), while the other was inside Ara\u00e7\u00e1 Bay (AB; 1.5 m \n\ndepth), which is located in the continental margin of the S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o channel. A 5L-\n\nVan Dorn bottle was used to sample water from 1m depth, which was kept in dark, \n\ntemperature-insulated bottles until laboratory processing. Three independent casts were \n\nperformed and the samples were combined. The water collected from Ara\u00e7\u00e1 Bay was a \n\npooled sample from three distinct points, as shown by Figure 1, in order to render a \n\nmore representative sample of the bay. The analysis included quantification of \n\nchlorophyll-a concentration in distinct size fractions, determination of inorganic nutrient \n\nconcentrations and phytoplankton photo-physiology measurements. \n\nSignificantly higher concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN; \n\nnitrate, nitrite and ammonium), phosphate and silicate were found inside the Ara\u00e7\u00e1 Bay \n\ncompared to the adjacent channel (t-test; p<0.02). Due to the low nutrient \n\nconcentrations in the S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o channel, we have assumed that events where N:P \n\nratios (i.e. DIN:Phosphate ratios) were above the overall median are considered here as \n\nfavorable nutrient conditions for the local phytoplankton community, which occurred \n\nfor more than 70% of the cases inside the bay. Previously published studies do not \n\nallow for systematic analyses of nutrient conditions since they were episodic. The \n\n\n\n57 \n\nmedian values chosen are, thus, based on a quality-controlled dataset available since \n\nJune 2013. \n\n3.2. Phytoplankton size dominance and the community size index \n\nFractionated phytoplankton biomass was estimated from four different size \n\nfractions of chlorophyll-a concentration, for which 250mL of water were pre-filtered \n\nthrough polycarbonate (5\u00b5m and 2\u00b5m pore sizes) or nylon (20\u00b5m pore size) membrane \n\nfilters, and the respective filtrates were concentrated on GF/F filters (nominal pore size \n\n0.7\u00b5m). In addition, a non-fractionated sample was directly concentrated in a GF/F filter \n\nto represent the total chlorophyll-a concentration. The microplankton fraction was \n\nobtained from the difference between the chlorophyll-a from total and the 20\u00b5m pre-\n\nfiltered sample; the nanoplankton and ultraplankton correspond to the differences \n\nbetween the chlorophyll-a from the pre-filtered samples at 20 and 5\u00b5m and 5 and 2 \u00b5m \n\nfilters, respectively; and finally, the picoplankton fraction resulted from the difference \n\nbetween the chlorophyll-a of the total and the pre-filtered sample through the 2\u00b5m \n\nmembrane filter. For the 2\u00b5m pre-filtration, no vacuum was used, in order to avoid \n\ncontamination of the samples by larger cells or detritus, and also to maintain the \n\nintegrity of the sample, which is very fragile at this size fraction. Chlorophyll pigments \n\nwere extracted in 5mL 90% acetone + DMSO solution (6:4 \u2013 Shoaf and Lium 1976), for \n\nat least 24h in dark and under -20\u00b0C, and the chlorophyll-a concentration was measured \n\nfluorimetrically with a calibrated Turner-Design fluorometer, through the non-\n\nacidification method (Welschmeyer1994). A calibration factor obtained from a \n\ncommercial chlorophyll-a standard (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to calculate the final \n\nchlorophyll-a concentration from triplicates of fluorescence measurements.  \n\nOnce the fractionated biomass was calculated, the dominant phytoplankton size \n\nwas obtained from the different proportions among those size fractions, as shown in \n\n\n\n58 \n\nTable 1. The dominant size categories include both dominance and co-dominance of \n\nsize groups. The approach used here for the classification of community size dominance \n\nis a modification of that proposed by Ciotti et al. (2002), but including also co-\n\ndominance of size groups. Samples that did not contain either two size fractions above \n\n30% or one size fraction above 40%, were classified as No Dominance (N.D.) and were \n\nexcluded from later statistical analysis. \n\nTable 1. Classification of the dominant community size of phytoplankton based on four size \n\nfractions of chlorophyll-a concentration: microplankton (Micro: >20 ?m), nanoplankton (Nano: \n\n5-20 ?m), ultraplankton (Ultra: 2-5 ?m) and picoplankton (Pico:&lt;2 ?m). The Mean Size Index ( \n\n?I(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ?) was calculated according to Equation 4 for each dominant size group. \n\nDominant \n\nSize Group \n??(???)?? ?? ?? ?? ??

(2004). Our approach used the percentages of the four chlorophyll \n\nfractions in the sample and a weighting function as a size index (Equation 4). It is \n\nimportant to note that the central sizes used for each fraction is an approximation, based \n\non local dataset of phytoplankton sizes (unpublished data) and can be modified if \n\n\n\n59 \n\nnecessary. The index was then averaged for each size dominance group ( SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ) of \n\nTable 1.  \n\n??(???) = (%? ?  50 + %? ?  15 + %? ?  3 + %? ?  1) 100?           Equation (4) \n\n The terms %M, %N, %U, %P in equation 4 are, respectively, the percentage of \n\nmicroplankton, nanoplankton, ultraplankton and picoplankton. \n\n3.3. Physico-chemical data  \n\nVertical profiles of water column temperature and salinity were obtained using \n\ntwo CTD systems (YSI Castaway CTD, YSI Inc. and AAQ-Rinko, JFE Adavantech \n\nCo., Ltda). Only the upper 1m data were used for the analysis, however, complete \n\nvertical profiles could be used to discuss and interpret the results. Sea level height was \n\nobtained in high resolution (30min) by an ADP (Aquadopp Profiler - Nortek -1MHz) \n\ndeployed in a mooring system near the entrance of the Ara\u00e7\u00e1 bay (-23.817; -45.402).  \n\nThe concentration of inorganic nutrients, such as nitrogenous compounds \n\n(nitrate, nitrite and ammonia), phosphate and silicate, were quantified \n\nspectrophotometrically (Hatch spectrophotometer, Model DR5000), according to \n\nAminot and Chaussepied (1983). Most of the samples were analyzed fresh, but in some \n\ncases they were filtered and then frozen until analysis. The ambient N:P ratios were also \n\ncalculated, as the ratio of DIN to phosphate. The nitrate and nitrite concentrations were \n\nsummed, as nitrite concentrations were consistently low throughout the analyzed period. \n\n3.4. Meteorological data \n\nSurface radiation values (W/m2) were obtained at 10-minute resolution from the \n\nCEBIMar/USP meteorological station (-23.823; -45.422). The radiation data provided \n\nby the sensor (spectral range from 400 to 1100nm) was approximated to the \n\nPhotosynthetically Available Radiation (PAR: 400 to 700nm) multiplying the solar \n\nradiation by 45% (Kirk 1994). This conversion factor is in agreement with comparisons \n\n\n\n60 \n\nmade between the sensor and the PAR sensor at the CTD system used during the \n\nobservations (factor of 41.9% - data not shown). PAR data was then converted from \n\nW/m2 to \u00b5mol photons m-2s-1 using the factor of 4.57 proposed by Thimijan and Heins \n\n(1983). The surface PAR values were averaged for two hours preceding the samplings, \n\nthat were finally averaged for each survey in order to have a mean irradiance intensity that our \n\nsamples were subjected to. The meteorological station also provided wind speed (m/s) and \n\ndirection (10-minute resolution) and daily precipitation rates (mm/day), which \n\ncomplements the overview of the environmental conditions preceding each field \n\nsampling. \n\n3.5. Photo-physiology and electron transfer rate measurements \n\nPhoto-physiological data were obtained with a Fluorescence Induction and \n\nRelaxation System (FIRe) bench-top fluorometer (Satlantic LLP). Measurements were \n\nperformed using the discrete sample mode, and the results are averages of independent \n\nmeasurements performed in triplicates. Fluorescence transients were measured after a \n\nsaturating LED pulse and an iterative fitting routine was applied to the fluorescence \n\ninduction curves as a function of the cumulative excitation light to derive F0 (or F?), Fm \n\n(or Fm?) and ?PSII(452)as per Kolber et al. (1998). The data was processed using the \n\nFireworx script for Matlab (Fireworx/2007, developed by A. Barnett and available at \n\nsourceforge.net/projects/fireworx and Matlab/2009). The parameters derived from the \n\ncurve fitting allowed calculations of photosynthetic efficiencies in dark and light \n\nconditions (Fv/Fm and Fq?/Fm?). ETRPSII light response curves were derived from \n\nintensities spanning 0\u2013600 ?mol photons m-2s-1 using 7 light steps. The actinic light \n\nsource was turned on 25s before the start of the acquisitions at each light step to \n\nacclimate the cells to the light intensity, and dark intervals of 20s were used after each \n\nlight step. The single turnover (STF) protocol was used with a flash length of 100?s \n\n\n\n61 \n\n(blue LED) and 15 sequential repetitions, with a delay of 10s between acquisitions, to \n\nallow the recovery and re-opening of the closed reaction centers between repetitions, as \n\nthe light curves are generated from static samples. The maximum rate of photosynthesis \n\n(ETRmax), light utilization efficiency (?ETR) and light-saturation parameter Ek (Ek = \n\n?ETR/ETRmax) were calculated by fitting a hyperbolic tangent model (Jassby and Platt \n\n1976) to the ETRPSII light curves. The FIRe was calibrated with pure chlorophyll-a \n\nextract (Sigma-Aldrich) and monitored monthly.  \n\n3.6. Data analysis \n\nDescriptive statistics shows the variability of temperature, salinity, irradiance, \n\nand inorganic nutrient concentrations in monthly averages. As mentioned previously, \n\nthis is the first dataset describing nutrients with consistent temporal resolution for this \n\nregion, especially inside the Ara\u00e7\u00e1 Bay. The variability of size-fractionated chlorophyll-\n\na concentrations, the community size index (SI(chl)) and the community photo-\n\nphysiological parameters (Fv/Fm, ?PSII(452), ETRmax and ?) are also presented as \n\nmonthly averages for both sampling sites. T-test analysis was used to compare means \n\nbetween both sampling sites for nutrients, chlorophyll-a concentration (total and four \n\nsize fractions) and the photo-physiological parameters, using the software package \n\nStatistica v.12.  \n\nMultivariate exploratory analyses were performed using the PRIMER (v.6) in \n\norder to ordinate the samples according to the environmental variables through PCA \n\n(principal component analysis) and nMDS (multidimensional scale) plots. Then, the \n\nrelationship between the environmental variability and the size classes of \n\nphytoplankton, using the micro, nano, ultra and picoplankton proportions, was tested \n\nusing a RELATE analysis that compares the similarity matrix between both datasets in \n\norder to verify if the size classes distribution is related to the ordination of \n\n\n\n62 \n\nenvironmental parameters variability. The same procedure (RELATE analysis) was \n\nperformed to identify relationships between the environmental variables and the photo-\n\nphysiological parameters of the phytoplankton community. \n\nIn addition to the ordination techniques to summarize the samples distribution \n\naccording to environmental variables and photo-physiological parameters, the \n\ndifferences between the generated grouping samples were tested thorough a \n\nPERMANOVA analysis. The PERMANOVA was performed to test the hypothesis that \n\nthere is no difference between the environmental variables distribution among the \n\nsampling surveys, both sites and different dominant size groups ( SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ), also looking \n\nfor the interaction among those three grouping factors. The resemblance matrices used \n\nfor the multivariate analysis were based on Euclidian distance for the normalized \n\nenvironmental dataset, and Bray-Curtis similarity for the normalized data of community \n\nsize fractions and photo-physiological variables.  \n\nLinear regression models were used to address the effects of phytoplankton \n\ndominant community size on the measured photo-physiological parameters (Fv/Fm and \n\n?PSII(452)), following the linearity suggested by the literature (Suggett et al. 2009a). Thus, \n\nthe photo-physiological parameters were correlated to the mean size index (SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ?) of \n\nthe dominant size groups proposed by Table 1. The parameters of the ETRPSII light \n\ncurves, ETRmax and ?ETR, were also correlated to the mean size index. \n\nTo discriminate and explore the influence of nutrients upon the observed \n\nrelationships between community size and photo-physiology, the dataset was split into \n\ntwo different levels of nutrients. The threshold used to discriminate nutritional \n\nconditions was the overall median of N:P values reported for the region, based on the \n\ndataset available since June 2013.Thus, positive and negative anomalies around the \n\nmedian represent high and low levels of nutrients, respectively. A number of distinct \n\n\n\n63 \n\nthresholds were tested (e.g., silicate, DIN) however the best predictive responses were \n\nobtained when N:P was used. The linear regression between size and photo-\n\nphysiological parameters were compared for both nutrients conditions using an \n\nANCOVA test (SPSS software, V20). The effective photochemical efficiency (Fq?/Fm?), \n\nas a non-linear function of irradiance (Silsbe and Kromkamp2012) was fitted to an \n\nexponential model (Webb et al. 1974) and compared between the dominant size groups. \n\n3.7. ETRPSII primary production model parameterized by the dominant community size \n\nAccording to the influence of phytoplankton community dominant size and \n\nnutrients availability on the phytoplankton photo-physiological variability (?PSII(452), \n\nFv/Fm and Fq?/Fm?), a parameterization of the Equation (3) was proposed in order to \n\nestimate ETRPSII light curves for different community dominant size. The estimation of \n\nprimary production values as carbon uptake (Pc: mgC mgChl-a-1 h-1) from the ETRPSII \n\nlight curves required the use of a fixed value for nPSII (=0.002; Kolber and Falkowski, \n\n1993), as well as a fixed ratio of the electron requirement for carbon fixation (?e:C = 8). \n\nThe latter is an approximate ratio found for natural communities dominated by \n\ncyanobacteria and small flagellates (Suggett et al. 2009b), which was chosen due to the \n\ndominance of small cells found in our study, based on the fractionated chlorophyll-a \n\nconcentration. \n\n4. Results \n\n4.1. Oceanographic conditions and nutrients variability  \n\nThe temperature of surface waters showed the expected seasonal pattern, \n\nvarying from approximately 19 to 29\u00b0C, while the salinity ranged from 31 to 35 PSU, \n\nwith no clear seasonality (Figure 2). Vertical profiles of temperature and salinity \n\nshowed a more stratified water column during the summer surveys (data not shown). \n\nThe variability of solar irradiance (average value of the two hours preceding each \n\n\n\n64 \n\nsampling) ranged from very low values (around 60 \u00b5mol photon m-\u00b2s-1) in the morning \n\nsamplings during winter to around 2000 \u00b5mol photon m-2s-1at noon during summer. It is \n\nimportant to note that even during winter months the irradiance can occasionally reach \n\nvery high values in this subtropical region, such as in August 2014 (Figure 2), when the \n\nthree-day average was 1000\u00b5mol photon m-2. \n\n \nFigure 2. Temperature (\u00b0C) and Salinity (PSU) (bars) of the surface waters for each sampling site \n\n(SSC=S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o channel; AB= Ara\u00e7\u00e1 Bay), and the incident PAR irradiance (\u00b5mol photon \n\nm-2s-1; open circles) for the study region. The temperature and salinity data are averages of the \n\ndays during the sampling surveys and the whiskers are the standard deviations. The PAR data \n\nwere averaged for two hours preceding the sampling, which were presented here as averages for \n\neach sampling. \n\n \n\nThe tidal cycle of S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o coast is a semi-diurnal cycle with higher \n\namplitudes in summer (Castro et al. 2008). During the present study, the highest tidal \n\namplitude was observed in January 2014 (1.25\u00b10.1m) while the lowest range was \n\nmeasured in May 2014 (0.78\u00b10.06m), which was the only sampling carried out during a \n\nneap tide. All others samplings were performed during spring tides or during a \n\ntransition phase. \n\nFrom August 2013 to January 2014, north-easterly and westerly-south-westerly \n\nwinds were predominant, in general with moderate speeds. High-speed wind gusts from \n\n\n\n65 \n\nthe west-southwest were registered for 20% of the data from September 2013. During \n\nthe October 2013survey, strong winds from the east occurred on the second day of the \n\nsampling. The surveys from February 2014 toAugust 2014 showed predominant north-\n\neasterly winds (>50%), followed by south-westerly winds (approximately 20%). Strong \n\nsouth-westerly winds were recorded before the August 2014 sampling, due to the \n\npassage of a frontal system. Low precipitation was registered during all surveys (up to \n\n~4 mm/day), except for February 2014, when the precipitation approached 65 mm/day.  \n\nThe S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o channel and the adjacent waters are characterized by low \n\nnitrogen availability, as described above (Methods). Our dataset also shows low nutrient \n\nconcentrations (Figure 3), specially for the inorganic nitrogenates in the S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o \n\nchannel, and in general, molar N:P ratios were low for the entire dataset, varying from \n\n0.23 to 9.5, with a median value of 2.23.Although still low, the N:P ratios for the Ara\u00e7\u00e1 \n\nBay were significant higher (N:P=3.58 in the bay against 2.28 in the channel), as DIN \n\nand phosphate concentrations (t-test; p<0.01). Silicate concentrations did not differ \n\nbetween sites (t-test; p>0.05). An increase in the N:P ratios was observed in the \n\nSeptember 2013 and February 2014 surveys at both sites, which coincided with the \n\nhighest values of chlorophyll-a.  \n\nNitrate plus nitrite concentrations varied from 0.16 to 2.02 \u00b5mol/L in the bay \n\nand 0.07 to 0.57 \u00b5mol/L in the channel, while the ammonium concentrations varied \n\nfrom 0.13 to 2.13\u00b5mol/L in the bay and 0.01 to 0.62 in the channel. In general, \n\nmaximum DIN concentrations were recordedin September 2013 in the Ara\u00e7\u00e1 Bay, and \n\nthe lowest concentrations were measured in December 2013 and January 2014 in the \n\nchannel (Figure 3a and 3b). The phosphate concentrations ranged from 0.17 to 1.0 \n\n\u00b5mol/L in the bay and 0.09 to 0.71 \u00b5mol/L in the channel. In the Ara\u00e7\u00e1 Bay, thelowest \n\nphosphate values were recorded for January and February2014, however, the greatest \n\n\n\n66 \n\nvariability was observed in January, when the maximum values were also recorded \n\n(Figure 3c). A similar pattern was observed in the channel, except that the lowest \n\nphosphate concentration was observed in September2013. The silicate concentration \n\nranged from 1.36 to 6.27 \u00b5mol/L in the bay and from 1.04 to 6.16 \u00b5mol/L in the \n\nchannel (Figure 3d). \n\n \nFigure 3.

On the \n\nother hand, the sampling sites were clearly grouped according to variability in nutrients \n\nconcentrations (not shown). The first two principal components explained comparable \n\ndegrees of variability of the data, with PC1 = 36.7% and PC2 = 30%.  \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4. a.

Distribution of the phytoplankton dominant community size  \n\nTotal chlorophyll-a concentrations were significant higher in the Ara\u00e7\u00e1 Bay, as \n\nwere the >5\u00b5m fraction, which includes the micro and nanoplankton(p<0.01). Overall, \n\nthe mean total chlorophyll-a in the bay was 2.49 mgm-3, and the micro- and \n\nnanoplankton fractions were 0.67 and 0.32 mgm-3, respectively. In SSC, the averages \n\nwere 1.96, 0.37 and 0.18 mgm-3 for the total chlorophyll-a, microplankton and \n\n\n\n68 \n\nnanoplankton, respectively. The chlorophyll-a from ultraplankton and picoplankton \n\nwere not significantly different between the bay and the channel, with overall averages \n\nof 1.05 and 0.55 mgm-3 for ultra and picoplankton in the bay, respectively, and 0.88 and \n\n0.53 mgm-3 in the channel. Figure 5 presents the variability in the proportion of the four \n\nsize classes of phytoplankton over time. \n\n \nFigure 5.

In \n\naddition, the results from PERMANOVAdid not present significant differences in \n\ntheenvironmental parameters between SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ? groups (p=0.67), as opposed to the \n\nfactors \u201csurvey\u201d and \u201csite\u201d that were significant (p<0.01).  \n\n4.3. Variability in the phytoplankton community photo-physiology \n\n Overall, averages of Fv/Fm and ?PSII(452) in the Ara\u00e7\u00e1 Bay were 0.41 and 288 \n\n\u00c52/photon, respectively, while in the channel they were 0.39 and 304 \u00c52/photon. For \n\nboth parameters, no significant difference was observed between the sampling sites, \n\nwith a clear co-variation throughout time (Figure 6a and 6b). However, the high \n\ncoefficients of variation within the samplings (up to 19% for Fv/Fm and 15.3% for \n\n\n\n70 \n\n?PSII(452)) highlight the large variability observed over short time scales, from hours to \n\ndays, also clearly shown by the large errors bars (Figure 6).  \n\n \nFigure 6. Variability of Fv/Fm (a), ?PSII(452)(\u00c5\u00b2/quanta) (b), ETRmax (electron RCII\n\n-1 s-1) (c) and \n\n?ETR (d) across the sampling surveys (mean\u00b1SE) for both study sites (SSC=S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o \n\nChannel, AB=Ara\u00e7\u00e1 Bay). \n\n \n\nThe ETRPSII light curve parameters (ETRmax and ?ETR) did not differ between \n\nsites. In general, ETRmax tended to be higher during summer (Figure 6c), while ?ETR \n\nvalues were more consistent between seasons (Figure 6d). Mean ETRmax was 191.7 and \n\n195.4 mol e-(molRCII)-1s-1for the Ara\u00e7\u00e1 Bay and S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o channel, respectively, \n\nwhile the mean ?ETR values were 0.72 and 0.68. We opted to present ETRmax and ?ETR, \n\nfrom which Ek can be inferred, however, the Ek data is not presented here since the \n\nspectral correction to account differences between natural and actinic light sources were \n\nnot performed.  \n\nAccording to the RELATE analysis, the samples ordination of photo-\n\nphysiological data (Fv/Fmand ?PSII(452)) was not related to the environmental variables \n\n(Rho=0.04, for 999 permutations). Meanwhile, a nMDS (Non-metric Multidimensional \n\nScaling) plot suggested a relationship between the variability of Fv/Fm and ?PSII(452) and \n\n\n\n71 \n\nthe distribution of the SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ? groups (Figure 7). ?PSII(452) was the primary factor to \n\nexplain the clustering of the samples along the horizontal axis, being negatively \n\ncorrelated to most of the samples of the larger size groups. Secondly, there is a trend of \n\nlarger cells being positively related to the Fv/Fm axis. \n\n \nFigure 7.

Photo-physiology as a function of community size and nutrients availability  \n\nSignificant linear relationships were found between the phytoplankton size index \n\n(SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ?) and both photo-physiological parameters. Fv/Fm showed a significant positive \n\nrelationship with the size index of the community (r\u00b2=0.92; p=0.035), while ?PSII(452) \n\npresented a negative linear relationship (r\u00b2=0.99; p=0.001) with the size (Figure 8). The \n\nrelationships were significant only when N:P ratios were higher than the overall median \n\nvalues (Figure 8b,d). Otherwise, the correlation between SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ? and the physiological \n\nparameters were not significant, although the determination coefficients were 0.69 and \n\n0.41 for Fv/Fm and ?PSII(452), respectively.  \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \nFigure 8. Linear regressions between the mean dominant size index ( SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ) and Fv/Fm and \n\n?PSII(452), under N:P ratio below the overall median (a, c) and under N:P ratio above the overall \n\nmedian (b, d). Dashed lines indicate 95% confidence interval of the linear regression analyses. \n\n \n\nThe ANCOVA analysis showed no significant differences between the slopes of \n\nthe regression line derived from both sets of data, i.e., low and high N:P, with \n\np(?PSII(452))=0.91 and p(Fv/Fm)=0.55. However, when N:P conditions are ignored, and all \n\nthe data pooled in a single correlation, the regression is no longer significant. Thus, for \n\nthe dataset analyzed here, the ambient nutrient conditions showed an important role in \n\nthe expected relationship between cells size and Fv/Fm and ?PSII(452), suggesting that \n\nthese relationships are valid only when the phytoplankton communities are exposed to \n\nN:P ratios above the overall median. The parameters ETRmax, ?ETR and Ek did not \n\npresent significant relationships when directly correlated to SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ?. It is important to \n\n\n\n73 \n\npoint out that the relationships and parameterization proposed here apply exclusively to \n\ncommunities where there is a dominance or co-dominance of specific size fractions, as \n\ndescribed in Table 1. \n\nFor the samples where N:P is lower than the median, attempts to predict both \n\nFv/Fm and ?PSII(452) using the available environmental variables were performed. \n\nMultiple regression analysis, using Fv/Fm and ?PSII(452) from individual samples (n=36) \n\nas dependent variable, and SI(chl) and the nutrients compounds as independent \n\nvariables resulted in a model that included SI(chl), ammonium and phosphate as the \n\npredictive variables for Fv/Fm while ?PSII(452) was explained by SI(chl), ammonium and \n\nnitrate plus nitrite. However, the regression models explain only 28 and 30% (p<0.01) \n\nof the variability in Fv/Fm and ?PSII(452), respectively. Due to this low prediction power \n\nunder low-nutrients conditions and as our central goal was to quantify the influence of \n\ncommunity size in the ETRPSII computation, our dataset allowed for parameterization of \n\nFv/Fm and ?PSII(452) only when phytoplankton communities were exposed to higher \n\nnutrients levels, i.e. N:P ratios above the overall median. \n\n The non-linear fitting of the decrease in Fq?/Fm? as function of irradiance \n\nprovided exponential curves that were discriminated by two different models according \n\nto the size groups: one with dominance of microplankton and the co-dominance of \n\nmicro and ultraplankton (groups 1 and 3 from Table 1) and the other one dominated by \n\nultraplankton alone and the co-dominance of ultra and picoplankton (groups 8 and 9 \n\nfrom Table 1) (Figure 9). The error bars show that Fq?/Fm? values are significantly \n\ndifferent between the two groups. The derived parameters provided two different \n\nmodels according to size. ? and Ek for communities with relative smaller cells are 0.193 \n\nand 300.42, respectively, and 0.169 and 253.71 for the larger ones. Ek and ? values \n\npresented here are the adjusted model coefficients and are not used as an absolute \n\n\n\n74 \n\nmeasurement of photosynthesis efficiency or saturation light for the community. \n\nNonetheless, the non-linear fitting of Fq?/Fm?can be used as an alternative method to \n\nderive ? and Ek (Silsbe and Kromkamp, 2012). \n\n \nFigure 9. Non-linear curve fitting of effective photochemical efficiency (Fq\u00b4/Fm\u00b4) as a function \n\nof irradiance for two phytoplankton size groups (the larger group includes communities \n\ndominated by microplankton and micro+ultraplankton and the smaller group is represented by the \n\ndominance of ultraplankton and ultra+picoplankton). The dots represent the averages and the \n\nwhiskers are the standard errors. \n\n \n\nWe emphasize that the proposed parameterization only applies if there is a clear \n\ndominance of sizes in the community (refer to Table 1). For Fq?/Fm?, we could \n\ndiscriminate two size groups, however it would be interesting to have a larger dataset of \n\nsize dominance to better discriminate the role of the intermediate size groups on this \n\nparameter, as Fq?/Fm? tended to be higher for group 3 (SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ?=20.7), when the curves \n\nwere analyzed individually. \n\n4.5. Photo-physiological model for primary production estimates \n\nETRPSII light curves were modeled based on the photo-physiological \n\nparameterization for different phytoplankton community sizes that were exposed to N:P \n\nratios above the median (Figure 10a). The communities co-dominated by ultraplankton \n\nand microplankton reached the highest values of ETRPSII and Pc (Figure 10b), with \n\n\n\n75 \n\nETRmax= 218.2 mol e\n-(molRCII)-1s-1and Pcmax = 2.59 mgC(mgChl)\n\n-1h-1. The lower \n\nvalues of ETRPSII and Pc were observed for the microplankton-dominated community, \n\nwhere ETRmax=189.3 mol e\n-(molRCII)-1s-1and Pcmax = 2.25mgC(mgChl)\n\n-1h-1. The Pc \n\nvalues provided by the model are reasonable and consistent with the primary production \n\ndata available in the literature for this region (Gaeta et al. 1990; Saldanha-Corr\u00eaa and \n\nGianesella 2008), which is important to encourage the use of the ETR-based primary \n\nproduction measurements for large temporal and spatial resolution data acquisition for \n\nthe S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o coastal waters and other high hydrodynamic regions. \n\n \nFigure 10. a. ETRPSII light curves modeled from the parameterization according to the dominant \n\nsize of the phytoplankton community. b. Carbon-based primary production estimates from \n\nETRPSII modeled according to the community size, using fixed values for nPSII=0.002 (Falkowski \n\nand Kolber 1993) and ?e:c=8 mol e-/mol CO2 (sensu Suggett et al. 2009b).  \n\n \n\n5. Discussion  \n\nIn coastal waters, physical conditions change continuously over different spatial \n\nand temporal scales, dynamically affecting light and nutrient availability for primary \n\nproducers (Cullen et al. 2002). A significant fraction of ocean primary production \n\noccurs in coastal regions (Longhurst 2007), and hence it is critical to develop tools for \n\npredicting changes in natural phytoplankton community structure and in turn its impact \n\non net primary production. Our study proposes a new framework for modeling primary \n\n\n\n76 \n\nproduction from photo-physiological parameters, based on their relationships to the size \n\nstructure of the phytoplankton community. In addition, the results show for the first \n\ntime how these relationships are altered by the ambient nutrients conditions on a \n\ntemporal scale of days to months in a highly hydrodynamic region. The applicability of \n\nphytoplankton photo-physiology and ETRPSII measurements to provide high-resolution \n\nprimary production data was also presented.  \n\n5.1. Oceanographic and meteorological conditions and their relationships to the \n\nnutrients and phytoplankton variability \n\nPhysical processes in the oceans generally alter the availability of nutrients in \n\nthe water column, which to a first order alters the dominant phytoplankton size structure \n\nand taxonomic composition (Cullen et al. 2002) and in turn manifests as altered \n\nphotosynthetic and physiological rates (Finkel and Irwin 2000; Irwin et al. 2006) for a \n\ngiven time and place. In a very dynamic environment, such as that presented in our \n\nstudy (see also Castro et al. 2014; Cerda and Castro 2014), the relative importance of \n\nshort-time scale physical processes, including tides and the intrusion of continental shelf \n\nwater masses (Dottori et al. 2015), confound prediction of either nutrient concentrations \n\nor phytoplankton dominant sizes. During the monthly time scale of our present study, \n\nthe two sites consistently exhibited distinct levels of nutrients whereas phytoplankton \n\ndominant size remained heterogeneous through time. \n\nThe high frequency meteorological data helped to explain episodic changes in \n\nnutrients availability, such as the stronger W-SW winds in September/13 followed by an \n\nincrease in DIN concentration (see also Peres 2013). This nutrient accumulation was \n\nobserved but we cannot discount that this may have arisen from a lower consumption of \n\nnutrients given that irradiance was also lower for this time point. These short time scale \n\nprocesses could not be related to changes in the phytoplankton community structure, \n\n\n\n77 \n\nbesides our sampling design did not generally allow for this pattern to be captured \n\nconsistently. These questions are being addressed by long-term studies, with high \n\ntemporal resolution, initiated in the region (www.simcosta.furg.br). In general, the \n\nmeteorological data registered low precipitation year-round and wind fields followed \n\nthe local seasonal regime (Castro 1990; Cerda and Castro 2014). \n\nThe Ara\u00e7\u00e1 Bay is extremely shallow (average 1.5m deep) and its volume of \n\nwater is exchanged daily with SSC via the semi-diurnal tidal cycle, which reaches \n\namplitudes of more than 1m during spring tides, as we observed. In the intertidal zone, \n\nmost of the bay is covered by sand and mud, with a diverse and abundant benthic fauna \n\n(Amaral et al. 2010). The bay also receives two independent sources of continental \n\noutflows (a small river and a sewage outlet). Given that the SSC is highly advective, \n\nand there is a very significant increase in depth from the opening of the bay (i.e., from \n\n1.5 to 5 m depth in few meters), we expect phytoplankton communities from the SSC \n\nwaters to advect to the Ara\u00e7\u00e1 Bay with the tides where they are then exposed to lower \n\nhydrodynamics (longer residence times) and significantly higher nutrient levels. Indeed, \n\nabout 75% of the samples with N:P ratios above the overall median were observed in \n\nAra\u00e7\u00e1 Bay, suggesting the importance of this area as a nutrient (i.e. nitrogen) source for \n\nthe local biota. \n\n5.2. The photo-physiological model: effects of phytoplankton cell size and nutrients \n\nconcentration \n\nThe absence of co-variation between the environmental data and the community size \n\nstructure in our dataset enabled us to pool all samples based on the phytoplankton \n\ndominant size, however exposed to different ambient nutrients availability. The overall \n\nmedian values of N:P was used as a threshold. It is important to note that the \n\nchlorophyll concentration below and above the N:P threshold were 2.18 mgm-3 and 2.8 \n\n\n\n78 \n\nmgm-3, respectively, highlighting that the low nutrient group is not affected by non-\n\ndetectable or noisy fluorescence signal. \n\nThe photo-physiological parameters Fv/Fmand?PSII(452) were linearly correlated, \n\npositively and negatively, respectively, to the community size dominance, expressed as \n\nthe mean size index (SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ?). Although our proposed classification according to \n\ndominant size has never been applied for photo-physiological studies in nature, previous \n\nstudies have shown the relationships between cell size and photo-physiological \n\nparameters (Moore et al. 2005; Suggett et al. 2009a; Fishwick et al. 2006). However, in \n\nour study, the significant relationships derived here were dependent on a threshold of \n\nthe ambient nutrients conditions, i.e. where ambient N:P ratios were higher than the \n\nrespective overall mean; most likely, this threshold represents the effects of high \n\nnutrient dynamics over time, as our dataset comprises short-term processes at temporal \n\nscale of hours to months, and the phytoplankton communities are not established in a \n\nsteady-state or balanced growth. Below this threshold the community is subjected to \n\nnutrient starvation. Thus, we did not find the inverse relationship between ?PSII(452) and \n\nFv/Fmthat would be expected based on changes in taxonomy under a continuum of \n\nsteady state conditions alone (data compiled by Suggett et al. 2009a).  \n\nAlthough our region has a consistently low nutrient concentration, the size \n\ndominance itself seemed to control about 90% of the variability in Fv/Fmand?PSII(452) \n\nwhen N:P was above the overall median value. Possibly, the taxonomical distribution \n\nco-varies with changes in size dominance under this condition, once the history of \n\nnutrients impacts the establishment of phytoplankton communities and responses of \n\nchlorophyll-a fluorescence can be the product of taxonomic adaptive processes (Suggett \n\net al, 2009a).  Under nutrient starvation, none of the statistical approaches trying to \n\npredict the photo-physiological variability were successful.  \n\n\n\n79 \n\nDirect effects of nutrients limitation on Fv/Fm and ?PSII(452) have been largely \n\ndiscussed in the literature based on both natural communities and laboratorial \n\nexperiments (Parkhill et al, 2001; Bibby et al, 2008; Suggett et al, 2009a; Rattan et al, \n\n2012). Nutrient depletion decreases the efficiency of PSII photosynthesis, which is \n\nattributed to the increase in the synthesis of light harvesting pigments relative to the \n\nsynthesis of reactions centers proteins, which are more demanding energetically, \n\nincreasing ?PSII(452), and consequently decreasing Fv/Fm (Kolber et al. 1988; Falkowski et \n\nal. 1992). On the other hand, phytoplankton communities can acclimate to nutrient-\n\nlimited conditions and achieve balanced nutrient-limited growth, e.g., to maintain their \n\nmaximal Fv/Fm values (Parkhill et al. 2001). Additionally, nutrient-enrichment \n\nexperiments in natural samples have demonstrated that nitrogen injections can promote \n\nan increase in the phytoplankton biomass without significant impacts on their \n\nphysiological parameters, thus showing a reduced physiological response to nutrient \n\nadditions compared with the importance of the community size structure and taxonomy \n\n(Moore et al, 2008). \n\nIn our study, the taxonomic variability does not seem to impact the relationships \n\nbetween photo-physiology and dominant size under N:P ratios above the median value, \n\nhowever it can play an important role in some cases, especially for the samples under \n\nlower N:P. Dominance of specific groups, such as cyanobacteria for example, can \n\nsignificantly alter the relationship between size and photo-physiology, due to the limited \n\nPSII absorption at the blue excitation waveband used in the FIRe fluorometer (e.g., \n\nSuggett et al. 2009a; see also Campbell et al. 1998). Similarly, we cannot discount \n\npossible artifacts to our low values of Fv/Fm via chlororespiration during dark-\n\nacclimation (Kromkamp and Foster 2003), which is an alternative electron pathway, \n\nwhere the electron carrier plastoquinone (PQ) is reduced through the respiratory activity \n\n\n\n80 \n\n(Nixon 2000; Peltier and Cournac 2002). This process can increase under severe \n\nnutrient limitation (Behrenfeld and Kolber 1999, Mackey et al. 2008, Suggett et al. \n\n2010). Oligotrophic waters are usually dominated by small cells, also the most abundant \n\nfraction in our dataset, which could explain low Fv/Fm values found at some cases.  \n\n5.3. Photo-physiology and primary production from active fluorometry \n\nThe relationships between dominant sizes and photo-physiology were used to \n\nmodel ETRPSII light curves and an estimation of carbon fixation was presented. \n\nHowever, the use of chlorophyll-a fluorescence for primary production estimates should \n\ntake into consideration a number of technical constraints associated with the \n\nmeasurements ETRPSII, as outlined previously (Suggett et al. 2009b, Huot and Babin \n\n2010). When comparing fluorescence techniques, it is important to consider the \n\nintensity and spectral quality of the actinic light and LED used for the fluorescence \n\ninduction, as well as differences in the induction protocols, mainly the duration of \n\nfluorescence induction (single turnover or multiple turnover protocols). Usually, \n\nspectral corrections according to different light sources is required to reconcile light \n\nabsorption coefficients across methods (MacIntyre and Cullen 2005) as well as across \n\nnatural environments or incubations set ups in order to compare methods for primary \n\nproduction estimates (Suggett et al. 2010).  \n\nWhilst these various corrections were not possible in our study, we have used \n\nconstant values for ?e:C (electron requirement for carbon assimilation) from the \n\nliterature to convert ETRPSII light curves to Pc in terms of carbon (mgCarbon mgChl\n-1 h-\n\n1), producing values of Pcmax that were comparable to those previously published via \n\nC14-uptake incubations technique for our region (Saldanha-Corr\u00eaa and Gianesela 2008); \n\neven so, we know that ?e:C varies as a function of taxa (Suggett et al. 2009b) as well as \n\nwith different oceanographic provinces and environmental conditions (Lawrenz et al. \n\n\n\n81 \n\n2013). Indeed, further measures of ?e:C are clearly warranted to verify the impacts of \n\nthe dominant cells\u2019 size on this ratio and how this potentially varies across the highly \n\ndynamic nutrient-phytoplankton conditions. In the same manner, the number of PSII \n\nreaction centers per chlorophyll (nPSII) proposed by Kolber and Falkowski (1993) have \n\nbeen measured on phytoplankton cultures and varied with both taxa and growth \n\ncondition (Suggett et al. 2010). Recently, a novel approach proposed algorithms that \n\nderive nPSII from fluorometry data (Oxborough et al. 2012). Unfortunately, our \n\nmethodology did not allow for the measurement or estimation of this parameter, and a \n\nfixed value was assumed (Kolber and Falkowski 1993). Note that if there is a consistent \n\nrelationship between the natural community size and nPSII, the difference among the \n\nproduction curves as a function of Irradiance (Figure 10b) may not be as clear. \n\nIn summary, the current work is the first attempt to parameterize the photo-\n\nphysiological parameters of natural phytoplankton communities derived from active \n\nchlorophyll-a fluorescence according to the community\u2019s dominant size-class and the \n\nambient nutrient concentration. We proposed a framework for a fluorescence-derived \n\nprimary production model (ETRPSII-derived primary production) that can be further \n\nimproved, through estimates of number of reactions centers and the ratio of electron \n\nrequirement to carbon assimilation, and how they also vary with the phytoplankton \n\ncommunity size structure. In addition, despite the applicability of the ETRPSII model to \n\nunderstand physical controls on primary productivity in our region of interest, this \n\nmodel can be further validated with independent datasets. This work therefore \n\nrepresents a novel contribution to the growing efforts to apply active fluorescence-based \n\ntechniques to understand variability of primary production in marine systems, more \n\nspecifically at high hydrodynamic coastal waters. \n\n \n\n\n\n82 \n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\n \n\nDirect comparisons of 14C uptake and fluorescence-derived primary production \n\nrates, and the role of cell size, in phytoplankton cultures of Thalassiosira sp and \n\nTetraselmis sp \n\n1. Introduction \n\nDuring the photosynthetic chain in autotroph phytoplankton, the energy \n\nprovided by light absorption generates the transfer of electrons that is the machinery to \n\nprovide energy for carbon fixation. The electrons can follow a linear flow or deviates to \n\ncomplex pathways, and this flow can be used to understand the physiological state of \n\nthe cells and the efficiency with which light energy is invested into the final organic \n\ncarbon assimilation. Much of this energy is utilized in physiological mechanisms as \n\nresponses to photoacclimation, nutrients limitation, temperature and other processes the \n\ncells can be subjected to, especially in highly dynamic environments. Accordingly, the \n\nelectron transfer rates (ETR) does not always linearly correspond to the rate of carbon \n\nfixation, due to alternative electron pathways (Prasil et al. 1996; Ralph et al. 2010) and \n\nthe efficiency with which electrons are ultimately invested into fixed carbon still needs \n\nbetter comprehension (Lawrenz et al. 2015; Hancke et al. 2015).  \n\nETR can be easily assayed through the emission of chlorophyll-a fluorescence \n\nfrom photosystem II (PSII) (Kolber and Falkowski 1993). One promising technique to \n\nassess ETR is the \u201cFast Repetition Rate fluorometry\u201d (FRRf), which probes \n\nphytoplankton photo-physiology, specifically the emission of chlorophyll-a \n\nfluorescence to estimate photosynthetic electron transfer through PSII. However, a \n\nmajor weakness is that a conversion factor is required to compute the carbon uptake \n\nrates, termed the \u201celectron requirement for carbon fixation\u201d (?C, mol electrons [mol \n\n\n\n83 \n\ncarbon]-1; see Hancke et al. 2015), which has proven to be highly variable and difficult \n\nto predict. Furthermore, most of the works that computed KC values have compared \n\nFRRf measurements in time scale of \u00b5s with carbon uptake incubations, in time scale of \n\nhours, and thus reconciling those measurements can be also a source of error. Few \n\nworks have performed simultaneous incubations to obtain KC in the same samples, \n\nwhich is a crucial methodological issue to be considered to advance towards good \n\npredictive models (Suggett et al. 2009b). \n\nEnvironmental conditions have already been shown to significantly influence \n\nobserved ?Cvariability (Lawrenz et al. 2015). The authors demonstrated relationships \n\nbetween ?C and parameters including temperature, nutrient concentration, and light \n\nattenuation, across a large global dataset, although the significant predictor variables of \n\n?C distributions showed considerable spatial variability. As environmental and distinct \n\nnutritional conditions in the water will impose variations in the taxonomic structure of \n\nthe phytoplankton in natural waters, assessing inter- and intraspecific plasticity in ?C is \n\nalso necessary to fully resolve the mechanisms responsible for its variability (Suggett et \n\nal. 2009b; Lawrenz et al. 2015).  \n\nDistinct taxonomic groups of phytoplankton have shown large inherent \n\nvariability in KC for both laboratory-grown species (e.g. Fujiki et al. 2007; Suggett et al. \n\n2009b) and natural communities (e.g. Boyd et al. 1997; Moore et al. 2003). Natural \n\ncommunities subjected to nutrient bioassays also show that ?Ccan be influenced by both \n\ntaxonomic and physiological adjustments, in response to alleviation of nitrogen \n\nlimitation (Hughes et al. 2015). Taxonomic classification is, however, not a trivial \n\nmeasurement, and thus is rarely performed for natural communities, so the cell size is, \n\ninstead, considered a good proxy for community structure and reflects environmental \n\nconditions (Sieburth et al. 1978; Cullen et al. 2002).  \n\n\n\n84 \n\nPhytoplankton cell size plays an important role in several physiological traits. \n\nSmall cells have higher light absorption, being less affected by self-shading and \n\npackaging effects than larger cells (Morel and Bricaud 1981; Ciotti et al. 2002; Finkel et \n\nal. 2004). However, larger phytoplankton are more efficient in utilizing absorbed light \n\nfor photochemistry (Suggett et al. 2009a; Chapter 3, now published as Giannini and \n\nCiotti 2016). Pigment packaging effects also dictate the plasticity of size-dependent \n\nphotoacclimation under changing light (Finkel et al. 2004; \u00c1lvarez et al. 2016). Several \n\nmetabolic rates are also shown to vary with phytoplankton size, in which intermediate \n\ngroups of natural communities would have fastest metabolism due to a balance in light \n\nabsorption efficiency, nutrient diffusion and assimilation and cellular surface-to-volume \n\nratios (Lopez-Sandoval 2014). Effects of cell size were also demonstrated in the light \n\nharvesting and PSII repair in response to fluctuating light (Key et al. 2010), as well as in \n\nthe nitrogen allocation to photosynthetic complex biosynthesis in diatoms (Wu et al. \n\n2014), however in these cases taxonomic changes should be tested for consistency. All \n\nthe size-scaling bio-optical and physiological performances already discussed in \n\nliterature suggest that the cell size has also a significant and potentially predictable role \n\non PSII light harvesting dynamics, ETRs and ultimately ?C, across a broad range of \n\nspecies. \n\nBecause of the effect of phytoplankton size upon photo-physiology and \n\nmetabolic rates are complex, it is hard to ultimately understand the role of cell size in \n\nregulating the conversion of photosynthetic energy into fixed-carbon, however we \n\nbelieve that along with other rates, ?C also presents a size-scaling pattern. The \n\nhypothesis of this work is that phytoplankton cells size should have a predictable and \n\nimportant influence upon ?C. The central goal was then to examine whether cell size of \n\ntwo laboratory grown phytoplankton groups influences ?C, testing the consistency \n\n\n\n85 \n\nacross the taxa (genus Thalassiosira sp versus Tetraselmis sp) that have well-\n\ndocumented differences in photosynthetic physiology (Halsey et al. 2013) and are \n\ntaxonomic groups commonly found in our region (coastal waters of southeastern \n\nBrazil). Photo-physiological and light harvesting properties, as well as ETR-derived \n\nparameters, were also compared among groups. \n\n2. Methods \n\n2.1. Cultures growth conditions and sampling design \n\nFour non-axenic cultures of phytoplankton were grown in the laboratory, two \n\nstrains of diatoms (Bacillariophyta) of the same genus: Thalassiosira pseudonana and \n\nThalassiosira weissflogii; and two strains of green algae (Chlorophyta): Tetraselmis sp \n\n(strain CS-91) and Tetraselmis sp (strain CS-352). The Tetraselmis sp strains were \n\nobtained from the ANACC (Australian National Algal Culture Collection) and the \n\ndiatoms were from the Climate Change Cluster department from UTS (University of \n\nTechnology, Sydney). As the objective was to cover significantly different cell \n\nvolumes, the choice of species was based on differences of at least one order of \n\nmagnitude in cell volumes of these taxonomical groups commonly found in natural \n\ncoastal waters of southeastern Brazil. The respective cell volumes were: 131.8, 1718.3, \n\n300.9 and 1569.6\u00b5m3 (see Table 1).  \n\nThe cells were grown in triplicates, under 65\u00b5mol of fluorescent light with a \n\nblue filter, that were monitored with a LI-COR light meter on the shelf (light:dark cycle \n\nof 12:12 h), and kept at 20\u00b0C. Cells were grown in f/2 medium (Guillard and Ryther, \n\n1962), prepared with autoclaved, 0.2\u00b5m filtered seawater collected from Sydney \n\nHarbour (Australia), and were maintained in semi-continuous batch mode through serial \n\ndilutions (Wood et al. 2005) to maintain cultures in exponential phase and under \n\n\n\n86 \n\nbalanced growth. The cultures were acclimated to the nutrient, temperature and \n\nirradiance regime for at least three transfers before commencement of sampling.  \n\nGrowth rates were derived from daily measurements of in vivo fluorescence for \n\nall replicates during the experimental period (about 2 months). Samples for cell counts \n\nwere collected every day during the entire experiment period, for at least one replicate, \n\nin order to have a ground-truth validation of the fluorescence-based growth. The growth \n\nrates (\u00b5) were calculated through least-square linear regression of ln cell density over \n\ntime, from which the growth rate is the slope of the regression fitting line (d-1). The \n\nvalidation of growth rates through cell counting have shown high correlation with the in \n\nvivo fluorescence (r2=0.90) for most of the growth curves, except for one replicate of T. \n\npseudonana (r\u00b2=0.60).   \n\nAfter acclimation and a series of dilutions during exponential growth, samples \n\nwere collected for numerous biological and physiological analyses, such as the \n\ndetermination of chlorophyll-a and reaction center concentrations (Chl-a and RCII), \n\nphotosynthetic unit size (PSU), cells size, biovolume and density, spectral light \n\nabsorption (achlphy), particulate organic carbon and nitrogen contents (POC and PON) \n\nand photo-physiological parameters based on Fast Repetition Rate fluorometry. Lastly, \n\ncarbon assimilation rates through 14C incubations were measured simultaneously to \n\nFRRf measurements (Electron Transfer Rates) to calculate the electron requirement for \n\ncarbon fixation for the contrasting cell sizes.  \n\n2.2. Biological measurements  \n\nChlorophyll-a and Reaction Center concentrations: Aliquots of the cultures \n\nwere filtered (10 to 30mL) for chlorophyll-a determination through the non-acidification \n\nfluorimetric method (Welschmeyer, 1994) , for which the chlorophyll pigments were \n\nextracted in 5mL 90% acetone+DMSO solution (6:4 \u2013Shoaf and Lium, 1976), for at \n\n\n\n87 \n\nleast 24h in dark and under -20\u00b0C. The calibration factor obtained with a chlorophyll-a \n\nstandard was used to calculate the final chlorophyll-a concentration, and the values were \n\naverages of triplicates. The concentration of reaction centers (RCII) and thus the \n\nphotosystem size unit (PSU; mol Chla/mol RCII) were derived from fluorescence \n\nparameters, discussed further in section 2.4. \n\nPOC/PON. Pre-combusted GF/F filters were used to retain the particulate \n\nmaterial after filtration of aliquots of 15mL of the cultures. The filters were dried \n\novernight at 60\u00b0C and kept in silica gel and in the dark until subsequent analysis with a \n\nCHN analyzer. The organic carbon (POC) and organic nitrogen (PON) in the filters \n\nwere quantified and volume-based quotas were calculated in \u00b5g/mL.  \n\nCell dimensions. Cell volume for all species was estimated from linear \n\ndimensions from images taken with a camera attached to a calibrated microscope \n\n(Nikon Automated Upright Fluorescence Microscope), using the Image-J image \n\nanalysis software. We measured at least 60 cells by assigning different geometric shapes \n\nthat were most similar to the real shape of each phytoplankton species (Sun and Liu, \n\n2003). Cylinders were used for diatoms and ellipsoids for the green algae species. \n\n2.3. Particulate light absorption and phytoplankton light-harvesting properties  \n\nPhytoplankton spectral light absorption from 400 to 750nm were measured for \n\nsamples filtered onto 25mm GF/F filters, using an optic fiber UV/VIS spectrometer \n\n(Ocean Optics, Florida, USA), where sample blanks were measured separately. \n\nParticulate absorption was calculated using the QFT method (Roessler 1998) from the \n\noptical density of the material after correcting for residual scattering at 750 nm. The \n\noptical density (ODf) obtained from phytoplankton particles retained on the filter needs \n\nto be corrected for the filter amplification factor (?-factor), i.e. converted to optical \n\ndensity of particles in suspension (ODs) (Cleveland and Weidemann, 1993, Roessler \n\n\n\n88 \n\n1998). We have used the quadratic function proposed by Finkel and Irwin (2001) for ?-\n\ncorrect both diatoms and the values estimated by Arbones et al. (1996) for Tetraselmis \n\nsp. The particulate light absorption (aph(?); m\n-1) at wavelengths between 400 and 700nm \n\nwas calculated from ODs using the equation 1 (Tassan and Ferrari 1995).  \n\n??? =  \n2.303 ???(?)\n\n?/?\n                                                (1) \n\nWhere ODs(?) is the ?-corrected optical density for all wavelengths, V is the \n\nfiltered volume (m3) and A is the clearance area of the filter (m2). The chlorophyll-a \n\nspecific absorption coefficient (achlph; m\n2(mgChl-a)-1) was obtained by normalizing the \n\nparticulate absorption to the chlorophyll-a concentration. \n\nThe proportion of light harvested by the phytoplankton antenna complex \n\ndirected to the photosystem II (PSII) was analyzed after a spectral correction performed \n\nto weight for the different light sources used for the measurements (Suggett et al. 2003; \n\n2004). The effective cross-section of light absorption by the PSII was measured by \n\nfluorometry through excitation with a blue LED (peak wavelength of excitation at \n\n450nm), and compared to the light absorbed by the chlorophyll-a after spectrally \n\ncorrected for each species (Equation 2). The chlorophyll-a specific absorption was also \n\nweighted to the other lights sources used here, such as the actinic light of the FastAct \n\nchamber used for the carbon uptake estimates the growth light.  \n\n?????? ??? =  ?(?\n???

Dark-acclimated photo-physiological state and the electron transfer rates  \n\nPhoto-physiological parameters and the electron transfer rates (ETR) were \n\nmeasured through Fast Repetition Rate fluorometry (FRRf), using a FastOcean \n\nFluorometer, attached to a FastAct chamber (both Chelsea Technologies, London, UK). \n\nDark-acclimated measurements of Fv/Fm (maximal PSII photochemical efficiency) and \n\n?PSII (effective cross-section of absorption by PSII) were obtained by the FRR \n\n\n\n89 \n\nfluorometer that was programmed to deliver saturating (ST: Single Turnover) flashes to \n\nPSII, induced by 100 flashlets at 2?s intervals from an excitation source of blue LEDs \n\n(peak excitation at 450nm, Fig. 2b). \n\nETR steady-state light curves were performed, with at least 20 acquisitions of \n\n100 saturating flashlets under increments of actinic light, from 0 to 1400umol photon \n\nm\u00b2s\u00b9. The actinic light steps provided ETR per cell unit volume calculated through two \n\ndifferent equations: the Sigma-based algorithm (Kolber et al. 1988 \u2013 Equation 3a) and \n\nthe Absorption-based algorithm (Oxborough et al. 2012 \u2013 Equation3b). Values of \n\nJVPSII (volume-based ETR) were also computed from both equations. \n\nETRvolSIG = ?PSII \u00b7 Fq\u00b4/Fm\u00b4 \u00b7 (Fv/Fm)\n-1 \u00b7 E \u00b7 RCIIvol                                    (3a) \n\nETRvolABS= aLHII \u00b7 Fq\u00b4/Fm\u00b4 \u00b7 E \u00b7 cell\nvol                                          (3b) \n\nE is the irradiance (\u00b5mol photon m-2 s-1), Fq\u00b4/Fm\u00b4 is the PSII photochemical \n\nefficiency measured under actinic light (dimensionless) and RCIIvol is the concentration \n\nof functional PSII reaction centers per unit of cell volume, where RCII concentrations \n\nwere calculated from fluorescence parameters as per Oxborough et al. (2012). Kn (the \n\nconversion factor used to scale fluorescence data to RCII) was cross-calibrated with the \n\nFastTrackaII fluorometer due to the fact the instrument was calibrated more recently \n\nthan the FastOcean. The correction factor between the two fluorometers was x1.204. \n\nThe same calibration factor was used to calculate aLHII in Equation 3b, which is the \n\nabsorption coefficient for PSII light harvesting (units of m-1), calculated from dark \n\nFRRf data (Oxborough et al. 2012). cellvolis the unit cell volume per volume of sample. \n\nBlank measurements of filtered samples were below 1% of the fluorescence signal and \n\ntherefore were not subtracted from the bulk fluorescence signal. Physiological \n\nparameters derived from ETR light curves, such as ETRmax (maximum rate of electron \n\n\n\n90 \n\ntransport), Ek (light saturation parameter) and ?ETR (light utilization efficiency) were \n\ncalculated by fitting a hyperbolic tangent model (Jassby and Platt 1976).  \n\n2.5. Carbon uptake rates and the electron requirement \n\nSamples were collected from each culture (three biological replicates) for 15 \n\nmin incubation, where the samples were spiked with radioactive 14C (activity= \n\n0.4\u00b5Ci/ml). 3mL samples inoculated with 14C were then measured in the FRRf under \n\nthe actinic light (66 \u00b5mol m-2s-1 \u2013 growth light condition) for a 15min incubation where \n\nETR was continuously measured, in order to compare the ETR against carbon \n\nassimilation for the same sample (to derive Kc with minimal methodological bias). \n\nAfter incubation, samples were transferred to a scintillation vial and 14C activity was \n\nterminated by adding 150\u00b5l of 6M HCl. This drives-off any remaining 14C into \n\ndissolved CO2, which can then de-gases from the sample. After at least 24 hours, \n\nscintillation fluid was added to the samples which were then counted using a \n\nScintillation Counter to measure disintegrations per minute (dpm) in the samples to \n\ncalculate the 14C production in \u2018mol Carbon m\n-3 day-1\u2019 as per JGOFS protocols (Knapp \n\net al. 1996). Dark samples were incubated in order to exclude any dark activity of \n\ncarbon uptake, as well as blank samples were included in the analysis to account for the \n\ninitial activity before the incubation (T0). \n\n2.6. Data analysis \n\nMost of the bioptical and light harvesting properties, i.e. proportion of light \n\nabsorbed and directed to PSII, and photo-physiological parameters analyzed were \n\nexpressed in unit cell volume base, and effects of the cell sizes were tested using a \n\nmixed-model nested-ANOVA, in which the taxonomic group was considered as a \n\nrandom factor (since we are not interested in the taxonomic effects of these two specific \n\ngroups into photo-physiology), that was nested within the size factor (fixed). That \n\n\n\n91 \n\nallowed for testing the consistence of the size effects when different taxonomic groups \n\nof phytoplankton are considered. The same approach was used for the photosynthetic \n\nparameters derived from ETR light curves, where two different algorithms were \n\ncompared, and for the electron requirement for carbon fixation (?C). Organic carbon \n\ncontent in the cells and the ratios to chlorophyll-a and organic nitrogen were statistically \n\ncompared, as well as the production derived from inorganic carbon uptake (C14 uptake) \n\nand organic carbon increments (particulate organic carbon times growth rates). The \n\ncoupling between the inorganic carbon uptake and conversion to organic compounds \n\nwas also discussed. \n\n3. Results \n\n3.1. Physiological characterization at balanced growth \n\nA series of biological and photo-physiological measurements were performed, \n\nensuring the cultures were at mid-exponential phase and balanced growth. Table 1 \n\npresents the characterization of the species in terms of cell volume and abundance, \n\nchlorophyll-a concentration, photosynthetic unit size, and other parameters, as well as \n\nthe results of the mixed-model nested-ANOVA. Dark-acclimated measurements of the \n\neffective cross-section of light absorption (?PSII) and the maximum photochemical \n\nefficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) were lower and higher for the larger size cells, respectively, as \n\nexpected (Suggett et al. 2009a). Such a response is mainly associated with the \n\npackaging effect of pigments that decreases the efficiency of light absorption per unit \n\ncell volume, due to self-shading effects (Morel and Bricaud 1981). Furthermore, the \n\nunit area of photosynthetic membrane space available per unit cell volume decreases as \n\ncell size decreases, and thus the small cells may have evolved higher ?PSII in order to \n\nmaintain high per-unit volume light-harvesting rates (Suggett et al. 2009a). Other \n\nparameters, such as the growth rate (\u00b5), the concentration of chlorophyll-a and reaction \n\n\n\n92 \n\ncenters per unit cell volume (Chl-avol and RCIIvol) and the PSU (photosynthetic size \n\nunit) were different between taxonomical groups (group(size) effects \u2013 p<0.01), and the \n\ncell size was not the main driving factor (Table 1). Diatoms exhibited higher \u00b5 (0.76d-1 \n\nfor both groups), however a significant effect of size was observed for the Tetraselmis \n\nspecies, with higher \u00b5 for the small isolate (0.57d-1 versus 0.24d-1). The same interaction \n\nwas observed for the Chl-avol, however Chl-avol was significantly higher for the larger \n\nthan smaller Tetraselmis isolate, suggesting an even stronger degree of packaging for \n\nthis specie (Figure 1b). Tetraselmis species exhibited higher values of RCIIvol than from \n\ndiatoms (Table 1), however RCIIvol tended to be higher for the smaller cells in both \n\ngroups (Figure 1c).  \n\n \n\nTable 1.

Light harvesting properties \n\nThe chlorophyll-a specific light absorption by the phytoplankton cells were \n\nmeasured for the PAR wavelengths band (400-700nm), showing that the Tetraselmis \n\nspecies present a flattening in the absorption spectrum around the blue band (400 to \n\n500nm), showing lower absorption at this portion compared to the diatoms (Figure 2a). \n\nThe spectrally averaged specific absorption (<achlphy>) are compared among the species \n\nin Table 2, that presents the light harvesting and absorption properties across the \n\n\n\n94 \n\nisolates. The distinct spectral shapes of light absorption emphasize the importance of \n\nspectral corrections when the phytoplankton photo-physiological properties are \n\nmeasured under different light sources. Here, we have used three different light sources \n\nthroughout our measurements and the appropriate spectral correction were applied in \n\norder to compare the light harvesting properties of the cells (see ratios in Table 2). The \n\nspectral shapes of each light source, with the respective normalized magnitudes, are \n\ncompared in Figure 2b. The blue LED is the light source of the FastOcean (FRRf) used \n\nfor the PSII photo-physiological measurements and the actinic light inside the FastAct \n\nchamber was used to perform the incubations for ETR versus Carbon uptake \n\ncomparison. Lastly, the Figure 2b also shows the spectrum of the growth light where the \n\ncultures were acclimated before the experiments. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.

As triplicates of achlphy were not possible, \n\nthe statistical analysis could not be performed, however it is clear that the small \n\nTetraselmis has the largest proportion of absorbed light directed to the PSII compared to \n\nthe other isolates. The size effect was then only clear for this group, while the difference \n\nseemed to be small for the diatoms. Such a trend was also observed for the PSII \n\nabsorption per unit volume for the small Tetraselmis (avolPSII), although the difference \n\namongst species was not statistically significant (Table 2). In general, the Tetraselmis \n\npresented higher proportion of light directed to the PSII, that corroborates to the higher \n\nRCII concentration per unit volume for this group (Figure 1c). \n\n \n\nTable 2.

The new approach proposed by \n\nOxborough et al. (2012) to calculate a volume-based ETR (or JVPSII) through an \n\nabsorption-based algorithm (Eq 3b) has an advantage over the Sigma-based algorithm \n\n(Eq. 3a) because, once the instrument is calibrated with a direct measurement of RCII \n\nconcentration, JVPSII can be calculated simply from dark acclimated data and the \n\nphotochemical efficiency under actinic light. Here, we have used the same calibration \n\nfactor to estimate RCII for both algorithms, so the differences here are based on using \n\naLHII or ?PSII. The Sigma-based algorithm assumes zero connectivity between RCs (open \n\nRCs estimated from qP), while the absorption algorithm does not require the assumption \n\nof RCs connectivity type. The differences observed for ETRvol were small, however the \n\nabsorption-based algorithm tended to compute lower ETRvol max and ?ETR\nvol than the \n\nSigma-based algorithm for all the species. However, it is important here that this \n\ndifference was consistent across the species. \n\n\n\n99 \n\n3.4. Electron requirement for carbon assimilation (?C) \n\nThe differences in the Kc are presented in Figure 4, where cell size did not \n\nshow consistent differences overall. Besides the differences among species, ?C values \n\nwere in general close or below the theoretical expected value for Kc in optimal growth \n\n(4 to 6 mol e-(molC)-1; Genty et al. (1989); Suggett et al. 2009b). The large diatom \n\nshows the lowest ?C, followed by the small Tetraselmis, although both presented ?C \n\nvalues below 4. The mean ?Cfor the small diatom was 4.5, which is close to values \n\nfound in the literature for both cultures (Hancke et al. 2008) and for natural \n\ncommunities dominated by diatoms, however the ?C measured for Thalassiosira \n\nweissflogii was lower in our study compared to previous reported values (Suggett et al. \n\n2009b). The explanation for the low ?C values will be discussed later, which is likely \n\nrelated to systematic methodological issues regarding both carbon fixation and ETR \n\nestimates (Lawrenz et al, 2015). The large Tetraselmis presented the highest electron \n\nrequirement (KC=6.04), which suggests this species to be the least efficient in \n\nconverting light energy into fixed carbon. \n\n \nFigure 4.

In average, the same gradient was observed across the isolates for both \n\nmeasurements (14C uptake and POC), where the large Tetraselmis isolate was the less \n\nproductive and the small diatom (T. pseudonana) the most productive. The comparison \n\nbetween both measurements per cell unit is presented in the Figure 5 for all the samples, \n\nwhich allows to have an overview on how inorganic carbon assimilation is used to build \n\norganic cellular elements against other processes that consume the assimilated carbon.  \n\nTable 4.

Discussion \n\nIn general, the effects of cell size in the light harvesting properties analyzed \n\nhere, as well as in the ETR-derived photosynthetic parameters and electron requirement \n\nfor carbon fixation were taxa-dependent. As expected, the only parameters significantly \n\nrelated to cell size, regardless of taxa, were the maximal photochemical efficiency and \n\nthe cross-section of PSII light absorption. However, all the complex interactions among \n\n\n\n102 \n\nthe utilization of light energy and the final carbon assimilation prevented the electron \n\nrequirement to have a consistent effect of cell size. The same approach would be \n\nencouraged using other phytoplankton groups, but it is important to note the groups \n\nused here are common groups found in natural communities (diatoms and \n\nchlorophytes), which were chosen randomly, however inspired by the natural \n\ncommunity composition usually associated with subtropical coastal waters. The main \n\nfocus of this study was the direct conversion of absolute rates of electron transfer into \n\ncarbon fixation rates and the investigation of the role of cell size in regulating this ratio. \n\nKC values are extremely variable, especially when including field work studies (Suggett \n\net al. 2009a; Lawrenz et al. 2015; Hancke et al. 2015; Hoppe et al. 2015). Lawrenz et al. \n\n(2015) have shown a global average of 10.9 mol e- (mol CO2)\n-1, although that were well \n\ndiscriminated when different oceanographic regimes and biogeographic regions were \n\nclustered. Suggett et al. 2009 have reviewed previous values of Kc across natural and \n\ncultures conditions, where communities dominated by diatoms presented Kc between 4 \n\nand 12 mol e- (mol CO2)\n-1, while they found cultures-based values for diatoms \n\n(Thalassiosira weissflogii) around 6 mol e- (mol CO2)\n-1. Those studies have shown that \n\nin many cases, the use of an assumed value between 4 and 6 mole-(molC)-1 to ETR-\n\nderived production will yield biased estimation of primary production (Lawrenz et al. \n\n2015).  \n\nIn our study, KC values were close or below the theoretical values for most of \n\nthe species, except for the large Tetraselmis. Low electron requirement values (&lt;4 mol \n\ne-(mol CO2)\n-1) have been previously shown (Boyd et al. 1997; Corno et al. 2006; Hoppe \n\net al. 2015), however it is important to carefully consider the distinct measurements \n\nprotocols applied among studies, especially regarding the incubation time (our protocol \n\nallowed for gross primary production estimates) and light sources, that requires \n\n\n\n103 \n\nappropriate spectral corrections. Low Kc values are difficult to reconcile and it is likely \n\noriginated from methodological issues, as well discussed by Lawrenz et al. (2015). \n\nHere, we have two potential sources of uncertainties in KC estimates: i) variability and \n\npossible underestimation of RCII concentration and ii) non-systematic errors in the \n\ncarbon fixation measurements. \n\nThe RCII concentration were obtainedfrom an algorithm incorporated in the \n\ndata processing in the FastPro (FRRf software). The algorithm is based on the dark-\n\nacclimated fluorescence parameters and a constant that was obtained from calibration \n\nagainst an O2 flash-yield system (Oxborough et al. 2012). However, the calibration was \n\nperformed for the FastTrackII fluorometer and thus we cross-calibrated the FastOcean \n\nwe used against the FastTrackII to derive another calibration factor (=1.204). It is \n\npossible that the FastOcean underestimates RCII even after this correction, and a direct \n\ncalibration against the O2 flash-yield system would be necessary. Similar KC values \n\n(from 2.7 to 6 mole-(molC-1)) were reported by Hoppe et al. (2015), in which they have \n\nalso used a FastOcean fluorometer to investigate the interactive effects of ocean \n\nacidification and distinct light regimes in Antarctic diatoms. Unlike our approach, the \n\nauthors have compared ETR to net primary production (NPP), that is lower than the \n\ngross primary production (GPP), once part of the inorganic carbon assimilated have \n\nbeen released by respiration after a certain period of incubation (Ryther 1956). The \n\nincubation time is a crucial information to be considered to differentiate NPP from GPP \n\nand compare KC among studies. The short incubation time used here (15min) \n\napproximates the measurement to the GPP. \n\nAnother issue that probably interfered with our KC estimates is the uncertainty \n\nin the estimation of C uptake. The 14C assimilation method for quantifying the inorganic \n\ncarbon fixation by the phytoplankton cells (Steemann-Nielsen 1952) utilizes the initial \n\n\n\n104 \n\ninorganic carbon measured in the sample, the precise amount of 14C-labeled carbon \n\nadded before incubation and the amount of 14C incorporated in particulate organic \n\nmatter. After a known incubation-time, one can calculate the rate of inorganic C \n\nfixation. However, it is based on the assumption that the uptake of added 14C-labeled \n\ninorganic carbon is proportional to the uptake of unlabeled 12C carbon during the \n\nincubation in a closed container. Possibly, there could be a shortage of DIC (dissolved \n\ninorganic carbon) within the cultures medium that would result in 14C inorganic carbon \n\nbeing drawn down in a higher rate than expected, and this fast assimilation may limit \n\nthe inorganic carbon to be fully replaced by the atmosphere equilibration. That would \n\noverestimate the carbon uptake during the time of the incubation, especially in such a \n\nshort-time incubation. This hypothesis is corroborated by the C : N ratios data, that \n\nsuggests low cellular quota of carbon, probably reflecting a DIC limitation. Although \n\nthat is observed for all species, the balanced growth does not seem to be affected.  \n\nFew works have performed simultaneous incubations to reconcile the electron \n\ntransfer rates and the carbon uptake (14C uptake) in the same sample. In recent years, \n\nmost of the work have compared instantaneous FRRf measurements (time scale of \u00b5s) \n\nand carbon uptake incubations (the shortest being around 1h). Thus, the timescale of the \n\nmeasurements for those comparison has been an important methodological issue \n\n(Suggett et al 2009b). The simultaneous incubation has the advantage of using the same \n\nlight source for both ETR and 14C measurements (the actinic light in the FastAct \n\nchamber \u2013 spectrum at Fig2b), so there is no need to weight the PAR irradiance of the \n\nincubation lights as is usually done. Weighting the ?PSII measurement for the actinic \n\nlight source would however lower Kc values up to 49%. We have presented Kc without \n\nthe spectral correction of ?PSII, once the incubations were performed in the same \n\nincubation light for ETR and 14C fixation (EPAR=66 \u00b5mol photon m\n-2s-1), with the aim to \n\n\n\n105 \n\ncompare the cell size effect on Kc. Table 2 shows that the weighting function factors \n\namong the species were similar, which would keep the same statistical results. As we \n\nhave considerations about a possibly systematic underestimation of ETR and \n\noverestimation of 14C uptake, we keep the non-weighting values (LED versus actinic \n\nlight) to avoid including extra noisy, although we are aware of its importance (Boyd et \n\nal. 1997; Macintyre and Cullen (2005); Suggett et al. 2003; Suggett et al. 2004). \n\nAlthough systematic errors can be associated to ETR estimates and DIC \n\nlimitation as discussed above, we believe still other sources of uncertainties in the 14C \n\nuptake of the large Tetraselmis occurs. The proportion of carbon assimilation and the \n\nnet carbon production estimated from POC data (Fig. 4) have shown low values of C-\n\nuptake for this species in relation to the net production. It is reasonable that a non-\n\nsystematic error in the 14C uptake takes place, and underestimates of gross \n\nphotosynthesis may occur due to isotope disequilibrium between the intracellular and \n\nextracellular CO2 pools (MacIntyre and Cullen 2005; Suggett et al. 2009b), and distinct \n\nassimilation of isotope carbon among species, that could possibly underestimate the \n\ncarbon uptake in the large Tetraselmis.  \n\nThe slower growth rate of the large Tetraselmis compared to the others species \n\nused here might influence the short-term 14C uptake rates and energy allocation, as it \n\nhas been observed to occur in diatoms under nutrient limitation, but could be present in \n\nother taxa (Halsey et al. 2010). In addition, the light-harvesting properties of this \n\nspecies suggest special features that could be driving this complex interpretation. The \n\ncells are extremely pigment packed and the effective light absorption is low, however \n\nthey reach higher electron transfer rates than the diatoms and the non-photochemical \n\nquenching dynamics seem to be more efficient (higher NPQ values \u2013 not shown), also \n\npresenting high Ek (=701.5 umol photon m-2 s-1). \n\n\n\n106 \n\nIn addition, it is possible that contamination by small autotrophic or bacteria \n\nconsuming inorganic carbon during incubation have occurred, especially because one of \n\nour replicates was excluded due to contamination, although we could not detect it in the \n\nreplicated we performed the experiment. Uptake of labeled 14C by heterotrophic bacteria \n\nand aerobic anoxygenic photosynthetic microorganisms may also contribute to \n\nuncertainties and the influence of these organisms on the measured 14C activity is yet to \n\nbe determined (Corno et al. 2006). Underestimating 14C uptake for the large Tetraselmis \n\ncould also explain the highest Kc found for this group (around 6), that even with a \n\nsystematic underestimation of ETR, could still be responsible for the higher KC than the \n\nother species. \n\nRegardless of complexities in estimating absolute ETRs, Carbon uptake, and \n\nhence Kc, the hypothesis that the cell size has a significant effect on the electron \n\ntransfer efficiency and the electron requirement for carbon fixation was not confirmed, \n\nand the taxonomic group significantly influenced the size response. It is possible that \n\nthe size difference was not large enough to show contrasting responses, although we \n\nhave tried to use different orders of magnitude in cell volumes. Our data suggest that \n\nsuch parameters more strongly depend on differences in the strategies of distinct \n\ntaxonomic groups to grow and maintain their biomass (Halsey et al. 2013; 2014). \n\nAlthough similar photosynthetic efficiencies, differences in the lifestyle strategies to \n\nallocate photosynthetically-derived products have been observed for these two specific \n\ntaxonomical groups (diatoms and green algae) under a range of nitrate-limited growth \n\nrates (Halsey et al. 2013). The differences are then related to lifetimes of newly fixed \n\ncarbon during different phases of the cell cycle. This distinct allocation of end products \n\nof carbon could influence the carbon uptake in short time incubations, with the electron \n\nrequirement reflecting such effects rather than differences in cell size, given the same \n\n\n\n107 \n\nnutrients and light conditions. More important is to consider these differences for \n\nnatural environments, although this kind of study still need to be done in laboratory. \n\nThe effects of taxa-specific strategies towards allocation of photosynthetic \n\nenergy and carbon increments according to growth rates can be intimately related to the \n\nrole of the phytoplankton communities to deal with natural transient nutrients conditions \n\nand the maintenance of the primary production at nutrient-limited regions, where the \n\nenrichment may occur in different time-scales. The phytoplankton taxa used here \n\n(diatoms and green algae) are common organisms found in coastal subtropical waters, \n\nhowever, the use of laboratory-grown cultures, although necessary, is enormously \n\nbiased when we try to explain photo-physiology strategies and energy utilization in \n\nnatural environments, especially when organisms with very complex optical and \n\nphysiological characteristics, such as the large Tetraselmis used here, are used to \n\ninvestigate patterns that seem to be clear in nature. Thus, we emphasize the need for a \n\ncareful interpretation of phytoplankton culture data. \n\nIn summary, whilst cell size strongly influences the efficiency of light \n\nabsorption and photochemistry, species-specific responses in photosynthetic energy \n\nallocation dominated the differences observed in how absorbed light is utilized to \n\ncarbon assimilation, i.e., in the electron requirement for carbon assimilation. As such, \n\ninteractive effects of cell size and taxonomy in the growth strategy to maintain biomass \n\nand production is critical to better understand the dynamics of primary production rates \n\nderived from photo-physiology in natural and highly productive sites.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n108 \n\nGENERAL CONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\nThe study presented an advanced overview of the fluorescence technique, \n\nproposing novel approaches that contribute to the improvement of primary production \n\nmeasurements from photo-physiology, especially in highly dynamic environments. The \n\ncentral hypothesis was that the variability in key phytoplankton characteristics, driven \n\nby contrasting communities that in turn are responses of environmental forcing, can be \n\nused to improve the parameterization of primary production models based on photo-\n\nphysiology. \n\nThe first main question relates to the impacts of the community structure and \n\ntheir physiological responses on the fluorescence-derived photo-physiological \n\nparameters. In a spatial scale, the pigments composition strongly influenced the photo-\n\nphysiology of natural communities throughout vertical mesoscale processes, once it \n\nrepresents the combined effects of phytoplankton biomass, taxonomy and acclimation \n\nprocesses, however highlighting for the contribution of photoacclimation-related \n\npigments compared to the taxonomy diagnostic ones. In a temporal scale, the effects of \n\nthe dominant size of the community could be quantified when nutrients were injected in \n\na dynamic coastal environment. In this case, more than 90% of the variance in photo-\n\nphysiology was explained by the community size when N:P ratios were above median \n\nvalues. \n\nAlthough the knowledge on how dominant size fractions of phytoplankton vary \n\nin time and space are extremely useful tool to understand the overall dynamics of the \n\npelagic environment, the bio-optical proxies of phytoplankton dominant cell size in the \n\nliterature could not explain the variability of bulk efficiencies of photochemistry or light \n\nabsorption, even in a given oceanographic region. In contrast, for a costal site, it was \n\n\n\n109 \n\npossible to construct a primary production photo-physiological model in which the \n\nparameters depended upon the dominant size classes of natural phytoplankton \n\ncommunities, physically fractionated, and the ambient nutrient concentration. This \n\nsuggests that either the bio-optical proxies used are not good descriptors of \n\nphytoplankton photochemistry or that the covariance among size, taxonomy and \n\nacclimation processes in the costal site sufficed for the parameterization based on size \n\nalone to be successful.  \n\n Secondly, the work approached the uncertainties in reconciling ETR and Carbon \n\nuptake measurements. We have also compared primary production values using \n\nETR:Carbon conversion rates (KC) from the literature with rates measured in two \n\ntaxonomic groups, commonly found in our study region, under laboratorial controlled \n\nconditions, given the complexity of such measurements. Using rates from the literature, \n\nthe calculated primary production values were similar to previous values for this region \n\n(using C14), reinforcing the viability of this technique for obtaining primary production \n\ndata in larger temporal and spatial scale. From cultures data, we have shown KC rates \n\nfor the two groups tested, which can improve such estimates for this and other coastal \n\nareas.  \n\nFinally, the study have analyzed the impacts of phytoplankton community \n\nstructure, more especifically of cells size and taxonomy, on KC and other physiological \n\nrates, under controlled growth conditions (same temperature, nutrients and light). For a \n\nbalanced growth, differences between taxonomic groups were more significant than \n\ndifferences according to the respective cells size. Although the use of laboratory grown \n\ncells is essential to derive constants and rates that are extremely difficult to obtain in \n\nnatural samples, such as the direct electron requirement for carbon assimilation, the \n\nresults should be carefully utilized when compared to natural communities. We have \n\n\n\n110 \n\nshown the importance of interactive effects of cell size and taxonomy in the energy \n\nallocation to assimilate the organic carbon and maintain the biomass, which is also \n\ncrucial to better understand the dynamics of primary production rates derived from \n\nphoto-physiology in natural environments. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n111 \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\n\u00c1lvarez, E., X.
