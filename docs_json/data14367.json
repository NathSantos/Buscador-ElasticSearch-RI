Estes materiais multidimensionais t\u00eam \nencontrado potenciais aplica\u00e7\u00f5es em \u00e1reas distintas: armazenamento e \nsepara\u00e7\u00e3o de gases, troca i\u00f3nica, cat\u00e1lise, magnetismo, em sensores \u00f3ticos, \nentre outras. \nO grupo de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em MOFs da Universidade de Aveiro tem preparado \nnovos materiais a partir da combina\u00e7\u00e3o de ligandos org\u00e2nicos com grupos \nfosfonato e, principalmente, lantan\u00eddeos. Esta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o descreve as \ndescobertas mais recentes nesta \u00e1rea envolvendo a s\u00edntese de MOFs \nmultidimensionais baseados em quatro mol\u00e9culas com grupos fosfonato. Os \nligandos org\u00e2nicos usados neste projeto foram desenhados e preparados ap\u00f3s \nsele\u00e7\u00e3o e otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o das condi\u00e7\u00f5es reacionais e m\u00e9todos de s\u00edntese. Rea\u00e7\u00f5es \nentre estes ligandos org\u00e2nicos e terras-raras levaram \u00e0 forma\u00e7\u00e3o de v\u00e1rias \nfam\u00edlias de MOFs 1D, 2D e 3D. A prepara\u00e7\u00e3o destes materiais envolveu o uso \nde m\u00e9todos de s\u00edntese distintos: s\u00edntese hidro(solvo)t\u00e9rmica, assistida por \nmicro-ondas ou ultrassons, \u201cone-pot\u201d e ionot\u00e9rmica. A sele\u00e7\u00e3o criteriosa dos \nligandos org\u00e2nicos mostrou ter um papel fundamental nas arquiteturas finais \ndos materiais: enquanto as mol\u00e9culas com grupos fosfonato mais flex\u00edveis \noriginaram estruturas 1D, 2D e 3D densas, um dos ligandos com a sua \nestrutura mais r\u00edgida levou \u00e0 forma\u00e7\u00e3o de uma MOF 3D porosa. A estrutura \ncristalina de todos os materiais foi resolvida atrav\u00e9s de difra\u00e7\u00e3o de raios-X de \np\u00f3s ou monocristal. Todos os materiais foram ainda caracterizados usando \nv\u00e1rias t\u00e9cnicas em estado s\u00f3lido (FT-IV, microscopia eletr\u00f3nica (SEM e EDS), \nRMN em estado s\u00f3lido, an\u00e1lise elementar e termogravim\u00e9trica). Algumas \nMOFs exibiram uma estabilidade t\u00e9rmica e robustez not\u00e1veis at\u00e9 \naproximadamente 400 \u00baC. \nAs propriedades de algumas MOFs foram investigadas. Estudos de \nfotoluminesc\u00eancia revelaram que os ligandos org\u00e2nicos selecionados s\u00e3o \nsensibilizadores apropriados para os cati\u00f5es Tb\n\n3+\n levando \u00e0 forma\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nmateriais emissores de luz verde intensa. A supress\u00e3o de grupos \u201cquencher\u201d \nO?H, atrav\u00e9s de processos de deutera\u00e7\u00e3o ou desidrata\u00e7\u00e3o melhorou \nsubstancialmente a fotoluminesc\u00eancia dos mat\u00e9rias contendo cati\u00f5es Eu\n\n3+\n. \n\nAlgumas MOFs mostraram elevada atividade catal\u00edtica, em meio heterog\u00e9neo, \ne uma excelente regioseletividade na rea\u00e7\u00e3o \u201cring-opening\u201d do \u00f3xido de \nestireno (PhEtO) com metanol (100% de convers\u00e3o de PhEtO a 55 \u00baC durante \n30 minutos). A MOF porosa foi usada em processos de separa\u00e7\u00e3o de gases. \nEste composto exibiu uma boa capacidade para separar propano de propileno. \nEste material contendo cati\u00f5es K\n\n+\n no interior da sua rede exibiu uma afinidade \n\nelevada para CO2 mostrando tamb\u00e9m capacidade para separar acetileno deste \ng\u00e1s inimigo do ambiente.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n\n \nMetal-Organic Frameworks, Phosphonates, Rare Earths, Catalysis, \nPhotoluminescence, Gas Separation \n \n\nabstract \n\n \nDuring the last few decades, Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), also known \nas Coordination Polymers, have attracted worldwide research attentions due to \ntheir incremented fascinating architectures and unique properties. These multi-\ndimensional materials have been potential applications in distinct areas: gas \nstorage and separation, ion exchange, catalysis, magnetism, in optical sensors, \namong several others. \nThe MOF research group at the University of Aveiro has prepared MOFs from \nthe combination of phosphonate organic primary building units (PBUs) with, \nmainly, lanthanides. This thesis documents the last findings in this area \ninvolving the synthesis of multidimensional MOFs based on four di- or tripodal \nphosphonates ligands. The organic PBUs were designed and prepared by \nselecting and optimizing the best reaction conditions and synthetic routes. The \nself-assembly between phosphonate PBUs and rare-earths cations led to the \nformation of several 1D, 2D and 3D families of isotypical MOFs. The \npreparation of these materials was achieved by using distinct synthetic \napproaches: hydro(solvo)thermal, microwave- and ultrasound-assisted, one-pot \nand ionothermal synthesis. The selection of the organic PBUs showed to have \nan important role in the final architectures: while flexible phosphonate ligands \nafforded 1D, 2D and dense 3D structures, a large and rigid organic PBU \nisolated a porous 3D MOF. The crystal structure of these materials was \nsuccessfully unveiled by powder or single-crystal X-ray diffraction. All \nmultidimensional MOFs were characterized by standard solid-state techniques \n(FT-IR, electron microscopy (SEM and EDS), solid-state NMR, elemental and \nthermogravimetric analysis). Some MOF materials exhibited remarkable \nthermal stability and robustness up to ca. 400 \u00baC. \nThe intrinsic properties of some MOFs were investigated. Photoluminescence \nstudies revealed that the selected organic PBUs are suitable sensitizers of Tb\n\n3+\n \n\nleading to the isolation of intense green-emitting materials. The suppression of \nthe O?H quenchers by deuteration or dehydration processes improves \nsubstantially the photoluminescence of the optically-active Eu\n\n3+\n-based \n\nmaterials. Some MOF materials exhibited high heterogeneous catalytic activity \nand excellent regioselectivity in the ring-opening reaction of styrene oxide \n(PhEtO) with methanol (100% conversion of PhEtO at 55 \u00baC for 30 min). The \nporous MOF material was employed in gas separation processes. This \ncompound showed the ability to separate propane over propylene. The ion-\nexchanged form of this material (containing K\n\n+\n cations into its network) \n\nexhibited higher affinity for CO2 being capable to separate acetylene over this \nenvironment non-friendly gas. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\ni \n\n \n\nTable of Contents \n\n \n\n \n\nAbbreviations ............................................................................................. vii \n\n \n\nPublications Presented in this Thesis   ......................................................... ix \n\n \n\nChapter 1  \n\nMetal-Organic Frameworks: Concepts, Properties and Potential \n\nApplications 1 \n\n1.1.

Supramolecular Chemistry \n\n \n\nFor several decades, since 1828, date in which Friedrich W\u00f6hler synthesized urea, \n\nmolecular chemistry have developed a huge number of powerful and highly sophisticated \n\nmethods to construct and prepare complex molecular structures through the creation or \n\nbreak of covalent bonds between atoms while carefully controlling the reaction conditions. \n\nDuring several years, organic chemistry grew very quickly, becoming one of the most \n\nimportant areas of chemistry. After several efforts, Robert B. Woodward and Albert \n\nEschenmozer, supported by a great number of collaborators, synthesized the so known \n\nVitamin B12.\n1 Nevertheless, molecular chemistry has just concerned in covalent bonds \n\nforgetting other interactions. \n\nWorldwide Chemists have been interested in other non-covalent interactions and, \n\nconsequently, a new direction in chemistry, called supramolecular chemistry, has gained a \n\ntremendous power in the last decades. This fact has been supported and documented in \n\nseveral published monographs.1-5 The term supramolecular chemistry was introduced, for \n\nthe first time, in 1978 by Jean-Marie Lehn, who won, with the two reputable researchers \n\nDonald J. Cram and Charles J. Pedersen, the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1987 due to the \n\nhigh progress that they have developed in this field.3 Thus, supramolecular chemistry is \n\ndefined as \u201cchemistry beyond the molecule\u201d. In other words, this field concerns with the \n\nstudy of molecular ensembles and intermolecular bonds.6-7 Figure 1.1 illustrates a \n\nsupramolecular complex achieved through intermolecular interactions.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.1 \u2013 Formation of a supramolecular complex from the self-assembly, through \nintermolecular interactions, of molecular units. \n\n \n\n \n\nSupramolecular chemistry is a relatively recent area, which has grown rapidly. \n\nNowadays, this area has becoming very strong due to the collaboration between \n\nresearchers belonging to distinct interdisciplinary disciplines (chemistry, physics, biology \n\nand technology). As mentioned above, supramolecular chemistry is focused on the \n\nconstruction of functional and highly complex chemical systems resulting of non-covalent \n\nconnections between molecular components.3,5,8-9 It is emphasized: \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n4                                                            \n \n\n- hydrogen bonding \n\n- ?-? stacking \n\n- van der Waals forces \n\n- ion-ion interactions \n\n- electrostatic interactions \n\n- ion-dipole interactions \n\n- dipole-dipole interactions \n\n- cation-? interactions \n\nCompared to the high energetic covalent bonds (200-400 kJ mol-1), the non-\n\ncovalent interactions have smaller energies: i) 4-40 kJ mol-1 for ion-ion electrostatic \n\ninteractions; ii) 1-80 kJ mol-1 for hydrogen bonding; and iii) less than 4 kJ mol-1 for van der \n\nWaals forces, dipole-dipole and ion-dipole interactions.2 Although weak, some of the \n\nnumerous interactions contained in supermolecules, the subject of study in supramolecular \n\nchemistry, have a great influence in the final properties of them. \n\nWithin the supramolecular chemistry area, one of the most important sub-areas is, \n\nundoubtedly, the supramolecular coordination chemistry. This comprises the generation of \n\nsupramolecular coordination systems possessing metal ions centers embedded in their \n\nstructure. The existence of both organic and inorganic components confers, in several \n\ncases, more than one property to the complex allowing its application in distinct fields.10-11 \n\nIn the literature it is possible to find a considerable number of supramolecular coordination \n\ncomplexes. One of these families is composed of highly crystalline and, sometimes, porous \n\narchitectures normally known as Coordination Polymers, Metal-Organic Frameworks \n\n(MOFs), Porous Coordination Polymers (PCPs) or Coordination Frameworks. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2. Metal-Organic Frameworks \n\n \n\nMetal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), also known as coordination polymers, are one \n\nof the most recent classes of functional materials and a hot topic which has been attracted \n\nworldwide research attention. Tremendous efforts have been devoted towards the \n\nchemistry of new and fascinating architectures, some of which exhibiting interesting and \n\nunique properties. Noteworthy, these materials are on the interface between molecular \n\ncoordination chemistry and materials science. The large number of reviews published in \n\nthe most prestigious scientific journals, scientific papers, monographs and books, have \n\nreflected the high interest from the scientific community around these materials.12-46 \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2.1. The Genesis and Terminology of the Name  \n  \n\nSince the appearance of crystalline, multidimentional and functional coordination \n\nmaterials, their nomenclature is a hot topic. However, in some scientific meetings, \n\n\n\nMetal-Organic Frameworks   \n\n \n\n                                                           5 \n \n\nworldwide researchers, working in this field, still did not achieve a consensus. This family \n\nof materials has been identified as Coordination Polymers (CPs), Metal-Organic \n\nFrameworks (MOFs), Coordination Networks, Porous Coordination Polymers (PCPs), \n\nHybrid Organic-inorganic Materials, Organic Zeolite Analogues, among others.19,47-48 \n\n The term CP is usually used to describe a class of materials formed by an extended \n\nnetwork of metal centers or clusters connected, through coordination bonds, to organic \n\nbridging ligands. This term is too vague because it does not refer to the final structure or \n\nmorphology of the solid material. For example, CPs does not clarify if the compound is \n\ncrystalline or amorphous, or if it is porous or dense. Thus, very often the term MOF has \n\nbeen used to define crystalline and highly porous compounds which involve strong metal-\n\nto-ligand interactions resulting usually in three-dimensional fascinating structures with \n\nhigh thermal and mechanical stability.18-19 \n\n Because the terms CPs and MOFs provide some ambiguity, several efforts have \n\nbeen done in order to have a decision about the nomenclature of this type of materials. In \n\n2009, Biradha, Ramanan and Vittall published a pedagogic work relating about this theme. \n\nAlthough some explanations about both CPs and MOFs, the uncertainty about which term \n\nshould be used for 1D, 2D or 3D crystalline coordination materials remained.48 Three years \n\nlater, in 2012, the nomenclature of CPs versus MOFs (after an initial project of the IUPAC \n\n(International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) Inorganic Chemistry division called \n\n\u201cCoordination polymers and metal-organic frameworks: terminology and nomenclature \n\nguidelines\u201d) was also discussed in a scientific meeting counting with the participation of \n\nseveral experts of this research area.47 From this discussion, it was reported two hierarchies \n\nof solid state coordination chemistry. In Figure 1.2 is depicted one of these hierarchies \n\nwhere CPs and MOFs are contained. Despite this attempt, it is still not clear what is the \n\nappropriated term to use for the nomenclature of crystalline coordination materials. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 \u2013 Illustration of a proposal hierarchy by the group of researchers in charge \nfor IUPAC to define the terms Coordination Polymers and Metal-Organic \nFrameworks.

Interests in MOFs \n \n\nIn the last years, the interest in both CPs and MOFs has grown exponentially. \n\nSearches in the ISI Web of Knowledge database can easily unveil a huge number of \n\nscientific papers reporting the synthesis, characterization and the properties of CP- or \n\nMOF-type materials. The first report describing the design and synthesis of a new class of \n\nscaffolding-like materials, using zinc and tetracyanotetraphenylmethane as the primary \n\nbuilding units (PBUs) was published by Hoskins &amp; Robson in 1990. This work constitutes \n\na preliminary attempt to construct, through strong and highly directional coordinative \n\nbonds (several hundreds of KJ mol-1), multi-dimensional diamondoid-type metal-organic \n\nframeworks. This pioneering work has been motivated worldwide researchers to focus \n\ntheir attention in the design and synthesis of new materials, resulting from the self-\n\nassembly of organic molecules and metallic centers. These compounds compose the first \n\ngeneration of MOFs.49 Evolving in time, scientists belonging to this field started to use \n\nsecondary building units (second generation)50 passing then for the production of large \n\nmetal-organic polyhedral cages (third generation networks known as MOPs).51 \n\n Consequence of the progressive evolution on the production of this class of \n\ncompounds has been reflected on the exponential growth of publications in international \n\njournals since 1990 (Figure 1.3).52 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.3 \u2013 Published scientific papers containing the terms \u201cCoordination \nPolymer(s)\u201d and/or \u201cMetal-Organic Framework(s)\u201d in their titles, abstracts or \nkeywords until 14 November 2013.

MOFs have another features and properties overlapping to \n\nother structures, of those we may highlight: i) the considerable resistance to structural \n\ncollapse due to the very strong coordination bonds; ii) MOF-type materials are more \n\nporous and possess world records in terms of surface area; and iii) complexes with \n\ngeometrically well-defined structures. The latter characteristic is extremely important to \n\npromote the isolation of materials with high crystallinity, and is an essential criterion for \n\nthe establishment of structure-property relationships.19,55 All these characteristics in MOFs \n\ncan lead to entering properties such as porosity (to store and capture guests), high internal \n\nsurface area (with the possibility to have functional groups available to originate catalytic \n\nprocesses), conductivity, magnetism, among many others. \n\n \n\n1.2.3. Building Components for the Preparation of MOFs \n  \n\nThe design and synthesis of MOFs involve a very interesting intellectual challenge \n\nbecause the final architecture strongly depends of the combination of two distinct \n\ncomponents: metal centers and organic ligands. These are known as primary building units \n\n(PBUs). The number and orientation of the bonding sites (coordination numbers and \n\ncoordination geometries) of the PBUs are responsible for some features of the material \n\nsuch as shape, pore size and topology. The dimensionality (1D, 2D or 3D), other feature of \n\nthe final structure of MOF materials, also depends of the employed PBUs. Figure 1.4 \n\ndepicts the process to produce the resulting multidimensional MOFs. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.4 \u2013 Schematic representation of MOFs with different dimensionalities (1D, \n2D and 3D). \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n8                                                            \n \n\n1.2.3.1. Metal Centers \n\n  \n\nDuring the last two decades, worldwide research groups interested in the \n\npreparation of MOFs have selected the metallic centers concerning their both final \n\nstructure and properties. Therefore having into account the structure-properties relationship \n\nof the resulting MOF materials, a vast number of metallic elements from the periodic table \n\nhave been employed in their preparation, such as: alkaline earths metals (i.e., Ca2+, Mg2+ \n\nand Sr2+), transition metals (i.e., Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+) and rare-earth metals, \n\nincluding lanthanides (i.e., La3+, Ce3+, Eu3+, Gd3+ and Tb3+).13 Due to their different \n\ngeometries, metallic centers display an important role in terms of the dimensionality and \n\ntopology of the final structures of MOFs. In the case of transition metals, according to their \n\noxidation state, they may possess coordination number (CN) varying from 2 to 7, giving \n\nrise to different coordination geometries (Figure 1.5).56-57 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.5 \u2013 Some coordination geometries of transition metals (CN = coordination \nnumber). \n\n \n\n \n\nRare-earth elements have been widely employed in the synthesis of \n\nmultidimensional MOFs.24,34,58 Because during my PhD project I only used this type of \n\nmetal elements, mainly lanthanides, in this topic it will be provided a more detailed \n\ninformation about their characteristics and properties. \n\nAccording to IUPAC, rare-earths are considered the elements with the atomic \n\nnumber 21 (Sc), 39 (Y) and 57 (La) to 71 (Lu). Additionally, the elements from 58 (Ce) to \n\n71 (Lu) are also called as lanthanides. The occurrence of the La to Lu lanthanide elements \n\nis not common. Therefore, these are more abundant in Australia, Brazil, China and \n\nMalaysia, being these the major exporting countries.59-61 In terms of solubility, lanthanide \n\nminerals are very soluble in water, however, their abundance is very low in all natural \n\n\n\nMetal-Organic Frameworks   \n\n \n\n                                                           9 \n \n\nwaters.

This \n\nprocess does not may happen in this case of the presence of complexing species;  \n\nvi) the chemistry of lanthanides is, mostly, based on the 3+ oxidation state in, certainly, \n\naqueous reaction solutions;  \n\nvii) in opposition to what happens with transition metals, Ln=O or Ln?N multiple \n\nbonds do not form.  \n\nIn Table 1.1 are described some properties of the lanthanide elements (Ln3+ ionic \n\nradii, electronic configurations and oxidation states).60 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.6 - Diagram of the electronic energy levels for lanthanide cations (Ln3+); n \ncorresponds to the number of electrons in the 4f orbitals.

The diagram of \n\nFigure 1.7 depicts the major photonic areas where lanthanide-based materials have been \n\napplied.63 \n\nThe lanthanide contraction, in other words, the decrease of the Ln3+ ionic radius \n\nfrom Lanthanum to Lutetium is attributed to the poor screening of the 4f electrons. This \n\nleads to that neighboring lanthanides exhibit very similar, but not identical, chemical \n\nproperties. The lanthanide contraction promotes some effects in the coordination number \n\nof the central atom and, consequently, in the coordination geometry.64-66 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.7 \u2013Schematic representation of the type of emission, as well as the \napplications, of lanthanide-based materials.

The coordination environment of these elements tends to be more \n\nspherical in nature than those of transition metals. They exhibit a higher range of \n\ncoordination numbers which usually varies between 6 and 12 (although coordination \n\nnumbers of 2, 3 and 4 are known). Due to this fact, the use of lanthanides in the \n\nconstruction of MOFs creates additional difficulties in the control of the final structure. \n\nNevertheless, the metal centers lead to unusual and remarkable topologies which cannot be \n\ndesigned with transition metals.58,63,67 In the Figure 1.8 are represented some coordination \n\ngeometries of the lanthanide elements. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n12                                                            \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.8 \u2013 Coordination geometries of lanthanide elements (CN = coordination \nnumber).

Organic Linker Components \n\n \n\nMany types of organic linkers have been employed in the construction of MOFs. \n\nThese molecules are responsible for the bridges between metal centers. To originate a \n\nstructure infinitely expanded the organic molecules have to be multidentate with, at least, \n\ntwo donor atoms such as O, S or N. The molecules differ from each other according their \n\ncomplexity and functional groups. They can be of aromatic or aliphatic nature and, \n\nsometimes, they contain heteroelements in their structure. In terms of functional groups the \n\norganic ligands must have at least two, which can be carboxylic acids, esters, amines, \n\nphosphonates, sulphonates, nitrile, pyridyl, imidazole, pyrazole, triazole and tetrazoles \n\ngroups (Figure 1.9) or even a combination of them. The shape (rigid or not) and length \n\n(i.e., distance between coordinating groups) further determine some properties of the final \n\nstructures.18,28,68-69 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.9 \u2013 Functional groups commonly found in the organic linkers used for the \npreparation of MOFs.  \n\n\n\nMetal-Organic Frameworks   \n\n \n\n                                                           13 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.10 \u2013 Organic ligands based on carboxylic acid groups for the preparation of \nMOFs: H2ox \u2013 oxalic acid;  \nH2bdc \u2013 benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (terephthalic acid);  \nH2bpdc \u2013 bisphenyl-4,4\u2019-dicarboxylic acid;  \nH2ndc - naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylic acid;  \nH2pdc \u2013 4,5,9,10-tetrahydropyrene-2,7-dicarboxylic acid;  \nH3btc \u2013 benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (trimesic acid);  \nH3ntb \u2013 4,4\u2019,4\u2019\u2019-nitrilotrisbenzoic acid;  \nH3tccn \u2013 tris(2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-4-carboxy)methyl radical;  \nH4pttb \u2013 4,4\u2019,4\u2019\u2019,4\u2019\u2019\u2019-(pyrene-1,3,6,8-tetrayl)tetrabenzoic acid;  \nH4tcpom - tetrakis[4-(carboxyphenyl)oxymethyl]methane. \n\n \n \n\n A careful selection of the organic ligands to construct a MOF is essential, because \n\nthese may display a very important role in the functionality and porosity of the resulting \n\nmaterials and, additionally, may provide the possibility of post-synthetic modification of \n\nthe MOF material.70 The majority of the research groups working in this area opt for \n\ncommercially available organic molecules. Their availability may be an advantage for a \n\nfast and cheaper preparation of MOFs. Therefore, it has been more frequent to find \n\npublished scientific works reporting the synthesis of MOFs composed of commercially \n\navailable organic ligands than those produced from designed and prepared ones by \n\nresearchers in the own laboratories using conventional (step-by-step from the ligand \n\nprecursors to the desired linker) and non-conventional in situ synthesis. In the later, the \n\norganic precursors are converted in situ into the final molecule which coordinates to the \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n14                                                            \n \n\nmetal centers. Several processes explain this in situ preparation: hydroxylation, \n\ndecarboxylation, alkylation, and hydrolysis.69,71-72 Although more time consuming and, \n\nsometimes, more expensive, the synthesis of new organic ligands may confer to the \n\nresulting MOF the desired properties. In order to explain the relationship between the \n\nproperties of the resulting materials and the nature and structure of the designed and \n\nsynthesized organic ligands, the MOF research group University of Aveiro published a \n\ncritical review discussing this topic.73 Having this into account, during my PhD project I \n\nprepared four organic phosphonate-based organic PBUs (chapter 2) to be used in the \n\npreparation of functional and multidimentional MOFs (chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6). \n\n As mentioned above, a huge number of organic linkers have been used for the self-\n\nassembly of MOFs. In the Figures 1.10, 1.11, 1.12 and 1.13 are represented some of them \n\n(commercially available or prepared by some research groups) illustrating the functionality \n\nand size diversity of the organic PBUs.27,57,74-100 Examples of phosphonate-based ligands \n\nare represented in the following section. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.11 \u2013 N-Donor organic ligands for the preparation of MOFs:  \n4,4\u2019-bpy - 4,4'-bipyridine;  \npyz - pyrazine;  \nbpc - 4,4\u2019-dicyanodiphenyl;  \nant - 1,4-dicyanobutane;  \nH2dpb \u2013 1,4-di(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)benzene;  \nbte \u2013 1,2-bis(1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)ethane;   \ntr3ad - 1,3,5-tris(1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)adamantane;  \ndpntci \u2013 N,N\u2019-di(4-pyridyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxydiimide;  \ntctpm \u2013 4,4\u2019,4\u2019\u2019,4\u2019\u2019\u2019-methanetetrayltetrabenzonitrile;  \ntpbtca \u2013 N1,N3,N5-tri(pyridin-4-yl)benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide;  \nH3ttpb \u2013 1,3,5-tris[4-(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenyl]benzene.  \n\n\n\nMetal-Organic Frameworks   \n\n \n\n                                                           15 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.12 \u2013 Organic ligands based on sulfonic acid groups for the preparation of \nMOFs: H4bds \u2013 butane-1,4-disulfonic acid;  \nH4bpds - biphenyl-4,4\u2019-disulphonic acid;  \nH4ads \u2013 anthracene-2,6-disulfonic acid;  \nH6tsmb \u2013 1,3,5-tris(sulfonomethyl)benzene;  \nH8tspa \u2013 1,3,5,7-tetra(4-sulfonophenyl)adamantine. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.13 \u2013 Mixed O- and/or N-donor organic ligands for the preparation of MOFs: \nH2pa \u2013 isonicotinic acid;  \nH2pydc \u2013 2,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid;  \nH2pba \u2013 4-(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)benzoic acid;  \nH3pmp \u2013 (S)-N-(phosphonomethyl)proline;  \nH3tip \u2013 5-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)isophthalic acid;  \nHata \u2013 (5-amino-1H-tetrazol-1-yl)acetic acid;  \nH4bptc \u2013 4,4\u2019-bipyridine-2,2\u2019,6,6\u2019-tetracarboxylic acid. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2.4. Synthetic Methods for the Preparation of MOFs \n  \n\nPBUs are, undoubtedly, very important components concerning the crystalline \n\nstructure of the resulting MOF materials. Nevertheless, other parameters (i.e., reaction \n\nconditions and synthetic methodologies) are also essential for the construction of these \n\ncompounds. The specific reaction conditions that can be changed are (Figure 1.14):  \n\ni) metal source (i.e., nitrate, chloride, oxide or acetate);  \n\nii) molar ratio/concentration of the PBUs in solution;  \n\niii) solvent (e.g., water, DMF, DMSO, methanol, ethanol or a mixture of them);  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n16                                                            \n \n\niv)  reaction time (depending of the synthetic approach employed, the reaction time \n\nmay vary from few minutes to several weeks);  \n\nv) pressure (ambient pressure, if the reaction occurs in an open reactor; autogenous \n\npressure if a closed vessel is selected, or controlled pressure when the reaction \n\noccurs in a microwave-assisted equipment);  \n\nvi)  temperature (from ambient to 250 \u00baC); \n\nvii) pH (adjust with acids or bases, as for instance, HCl or NaOH).  \n\nAlthough all the reaction conditions display an important role in the preparation of \n\nMOFs, it was found that there is a relationship between the last two (temperature and pH) \n\nand the final structure of these materials.18,101-103 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.14 \u2013 Reaction variables that may be optimized for the preparation of MOFs.  \n \n \n Depending of the final purpose, multidimentional MOFs may be prepared \n\nemploying different and distinct synthetic methodologies. Some of them (i.e., microwave- , \n\nultrasound-assisted and one-pot synthesis) are faster, being more attractive for industry. \n\nHowever, the possibility to obtain the desired materials as large single-crystals is very \n\noften a difficult task to achieve. In opposition, slow diffusion and hydro(solvo)thermal \n\napproaches lead to large single-crystal particles, but they are, normally, time-consuming \n\nmethodologies. In the following paragraphs some details of various synthetic \n\nmethodologies will be described. \n\n \n\nSlow diffusion can be employed when MOFs are pretended as large single-crystals \n\n(fundamental for X-ray diffraction studies). This methodology consists on the slowly \n\n\u201cbring into contact\u201d of different solutions containing reactive species (organic ligands and \n\nmetal centers). Therefore, this method consists in the preparation of saturated solutions \n\n(having different density) containing the metal salts and organic ligands dissolved in a \n\nsuitable solvent or a mixture of solvents. After the first solution being transferred for a \n\nsuitable reaction vessel, a less dense solvent is added. Finally the second solution is \n\ntransferred to the vessel and a system composed of three layers is formed. This reaction \n\nsystem mixture is kept in an open, or partially open, system at ambient or low temperature \n\n\n\nMetal-Organic Frameworks   \n\n \n\n                                                           17 \n \n\nFigure 1.16 \u2013 Representation of the \napparatus used in microwave-\nassisted synthesis. Inset is a \ncommon reactor for this equipment.  \n\nFigure 1.15 \u2013 Representation of the \ninstrumentation used in \nhydro(solvo)thermal synthesis: oven \nand autoclave (inset). \n\nwhile the layers start to mixture, leading to the contact of the organic and inorganic \n\ncomponents and, consequently, to the formation of the MOF material. Although very \n\nsimple, this synthetic approach is typically very slow, taking several days, weeks or even \n\nmonths.104-107 \n\n \n\nHydro(solvo)thermal synthesis was originally \n\ndeveloped for the synthesis of zeolites. This \n\nmethod is, undoubtedly, the most widely used in \n\nthe self-assembly of multidimensional MOFs. The \n\nprepared reaction mixtures are transferred to a \n\nclosed system (autoclave) and then placed inside \n\nan oven. The operation temperature range is \n\nbetween 80 and 250 \u00baC. Sometimes it is necessary \n\nto perform heating and cooling temperature ramps \n\nto isolate large single-crystals. The system is under \n\nautogenous pressure. Besides water, another \n\nsolvents are used such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), \n\ntoluene, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), among \n\nseveral others. DMF has become a popular solvent \n\ndue to its high boiling point and capacity to dissolve metal salts and organic ligands, \n\nmainly carboxylic acids.108-110 \n\n  \n\nIonothermal synthesis was developed by Morris in 2004.111 This recent methodology \n\nemploys ionic liquids (ILs) and eutectic mixtures which provides different reaction \n\nconditions when compared to the conventional solvo(hydro)thermal synthesis. ILs act at \n\nthe same time as the reaction solvent, template, or charge-compensating group. Because \n\nthere are a large number of possible binary ionic liquids and eutectic mixtures, this method \n\nhave been used in the construction of several porous materials by selecting solvents with \n\ndifferent properties.112-114 \n\n \n\nMicrowave-assisted synthesis (MWAS) is not very \n\ncommon, when compared, for instance, with the \n\nhydro(solvo)thermal method. Very interesting results \n\nhave been, however, published by using this approach. \n\nResearchers have preferred this synthetic method \n\nbecause it is a simpler and energy-efficient heating \n\nprocess, it allows the reduction of the crystallization \n\ntimes, improve yields, the possibility to control the \n\nmorphology of the structure, phase selectivity, \n\nnarrow particle distribution and also allows an easy \n\nvariation of the reaction parameters. This method has \n\nthe main disadvantage of not typically allowing the \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n18                                                            \n \n\nFigure 1.17 \u2013 Picture of the system used by \nM\u00fcller et al. to produce the HKUST-1 MOF \nby electrochemistry synthesis. \n\nisolation of large single crystals for X-ray diffraction.109,115-117 \n\n \n\nElectrochemical Synthesis is not very usual for the preparation of MOFs.

Therefore, \n\nultrasonication promotes homogeneous \n\nnucleation in very short crystallization \n\nperiods of time owing the creation, \n\ngrowth and collapse of an acoustic \n\ncavitation that leads to very high \n\ntemperatures (5000-25000 K) and \n\npressures and the possibility for fast heating and cooling processes.120-123 USAS have been \n\nseen as a very good synthetic approach for the preparation of nano-sized MOFs.121,124-125 \n\nFigure 1.18 \u2013 Schematic representation of a \nultrasound equipment. \n\n\n\nMetal-Organic Frameworks   \n\n \n\n                                                           19 \n \n\nOne-pot synthesis is, probably, the easiest synthetic \n\nmethodology used for the production of MOFs. One-\n\npot approach is based on the stirring of the reactants \n\n(organic ligands and metal centers) at ambient pressure \n\nand temperature (being this latter parameter easily \n\naltered for higher values using, as for instance, a \n\nregular heating plate). This bench methodology has \n\ngained relevant research interests due to its simplicity \n\nand low energy consumption. Additionally, the \n\npossibility to prepare MOFs at ambient temperature, \n\nduring short periods of time with particle size ranging \n\nfrom few nanometers to several hundred of \n\nmicrometers, boosted in recent years the use of this \n\napproach as a strong synthetic alternative.126-132 \n\n \n\n \n\n1.3. Properties and Potential Applications of MOFs \n\n \n\nMultidimensional MOFs have found potential applications in several and distinct \n\nareas due to their unique properties. In the next sub-sections it will be described in more \n\ndetail some of the properties of MOFs which were investigated during my PhD project: i) \n\nporosity; ii) heterogeneous catalytic activity; and iii) luminescence. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.3.1. Porosity  \n \n\nIn opposition that described for other solid-state materials (e.g., active carbons), \n\nMOFs are widely known by the close control over their crystalline structures. The quest for \n\nnovel and functional multidimentional MOFs is an enormous challenge having attracted \n\nthe interest of several worldwide research groups. Porosity is, undoubtedly, the most \n\ndesired property for MOF materials with researchers working in this field have been \n\nlooking for materials: i) capable to store species (e.g., CH4, H2); ii) for gas separation \n\nprocesses (as for instance, retention of CO2 from a mixture of gases); iii) with large pores \n\nto allow the interaction between catalytic active sites and some molecules to be \n\ntransformed; and iv) to accommodate biologically active molecules to be used, as for \n\ninstance, in drug delivering processes. For that, MOFs should have large and accessible \n\nchannels without self-penetration, be charged (typically anionic) to allow the ion exchange \n\nand be chemically stable when in contact with solvents, mainly water, for  their application \n\nas functional materials.133 According to IUPAC notation porous materials are classified \n\ninto several types based on their width of the pore: i) microporous (20 \u00c5 or less); ii) \n\nmesoporous (in the range of 20-500 \u00c5); and iii) macroporous (pores with sizes larger than \n\nFigure 1.19 \u2013 Schematic \nrepresentation of the one-pot \nsynthesis of a MOF produced in \nour laboratory. \n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n20                                                            \n \n\n500 \u00c5).134 Besides porosity, other important requirement for MOFs is their zeolite-type \n\nbehavior for reversible exchange of guest chemical species (Figure 1.20).32 Nevertheless, \n\nporosity is the basis to occur the zeolitic behavior in MOFs, as for instance, in ion \n\nexchange, adsorption and desorption, enantiomer separation or selective catalytic \n\nprocesses. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.20 \u2013 Schematic representation of the zeolite-type behavior which occurs in \nreversible guest molecules exchange process through the porous network of MOFs. \nReproduced from reference 32.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.21 \u2013 Representation of the crystalline and cubic topology of the IRMOF \nfamily and the respective organic ligands.

Keeping this in \n\nmind, scientists have carefully selected, from commercially sources or designed and \n\nprepared by themselves, a large number of organic PBUs. Omar Yaghi, very often called \n\nas godfather of MOFs, and coworkers published a very interesting work reporting the \n\nrational design and reticular synthesis of a family of open-framework MOFs, known as \n\nIRMOFs (isoreticular metal-organic frameworks), based on the extension of MOF-5 \n\n(Figure 1.21).54 For that, it was used Zn2+ cations and several organic ligands (the \n\ncommercially available terephthalic acid (BDC) and other organic linkers which could \n\nexpand the pores while maintaining the cubic topology of the parent materials).34,75 \n\nSome group leaders, as for instance Susumu Kitagawa, Gerard F\u00e9rey, Joseph Hupp, \n\nJeffrey Long, Martin Schr\u00f6der, among others, have dedicated enormous effort into the \n\npreparation of functional porous MOFs. Having into account the porosity of MOFs, \n\nvarious intriguing porous structures have been reported. Table 1.2 lists known porous \n\nMOFs produced since 1999 until 2013.

Methane and Hydrogen storage \n\n  \n\nThe prime challenge of the 21st century faced by chemists is, undoubtedly, energy \n\nstorage: i) hydrogen appears as an environmentally friendly energy carrier and clean fuel; \n\nand ii) methane, a component of natural gas, seems to be an attractive fuel, since it is very \n\nabundant and its burning process is clean. Therefore, both gases are excellent and realistic \n\nalternatives to the common fossil fuels. Additionally, the necessity to store and to use them \n\nas fuels in a cheap, safe and convenient way is a great requirement and a great challenge.  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n24                                                            \n \n\nFor that, several research groups have produced various porous MOF materials to \n\nfacilitate the storage of H2 and CH4, as for instance, in automobiles while fulfilling the \n\nrequirements mentioned above. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) published recently \n\nthe following storage target values: for H2, at near-ambient temperature (-40 to 85 \u00baC) and \n\namenable pressures (&lt;100 bar), the target is 9.0 wt% and 81 g L-1 by 2015; for CH4 is 180 \n\n(STP) cm3 cm-3 (25 \u00baC, 35 bar) (Note: STP means standard temperature and pressure).169  \n\nZeolites (exhibiting CH4 uptake below 100 (STP) cm\n3 cm-3) and porous carbon \n\nmaterials (showing a CH4 uptake in the range of 50-160 (STP) cm\n3 cm-3) possess good \n\ncapacities in CH4 adsorption.\n170-171 Although some porous carbon materials have values of \n\nmethane uptake close of the DOE target, this type of compounds have, as strong limitation, \n\nthe increase of their high surface area (? 2000 - 3500 m2 g-1).169 \n\nOne inconvenient to store the natural gas CH4 is based on its low energy density. \n\nThis fact leads to a necessity to store it either at very high pressures as well as a liquid to \n\nuse it in vehicles.172 Nevertheless, various researchers have reported that some MOFs have \n\nexhibited a great capacity to adsorb CH4. In 2000, Kitagawa et al. reported the preparation \n\nof [CuSiF6(4,4\u2019-bpy)] MOF shown as a new potential inorganic-organic hybrid material to \n\nadsorb methane.138 Since then, dozens of MOF materials have been reported having high \n\ncapacity to adsorb CH4, of which it is emphasized: HKUST-1,\n173 MIL-101,173 USTA-20,167 \n\nNu-125,168 NOT-122174 and PCN-14.157 \n\nRecently Yildirim et al. published a very interesting work reporting the capacity of \n\nsix well-known MOFs (NU-11, NU-125, UTSA-20, PCN-14, Ni-MOF-74 (Ni-CPO-27) \n\nand HKUST-1) for CH4 uptake (Figure 1.23).\n175 Investigations performed reveal that these \n\nporous materials present very good capacity towards CH4 adsorption. Although Ni-MOF-\n\n74 can adsorb very high CH4 quantity, the commercially available in gram scale HKUST-\n\n1, exceeds any value reported to date. At ambient temperature the volumetric CH4 uptake \n\nis about 230 cm3 cm-3 at 35 bar and 270 cm3 cm-3 at 65 bar. These values reach the new \n\nvolumetric target recently set by the DOE, if the packing efficiency loss is ignored. Despite \n\nthese excellent results, there are other issues to have into account, as for instance, the cost \n\nand the chemical stability of these materials. \n\n Because H2 is a viable energy source to replace common fossil combustibles (one \n\nof the most responsible for the greenhouse effect), several research groups have dedicated \n\nenormous efforts in order to produce porous materials with capacity to store this gas in a \n\nsafe and cheap manner and, consequently, use it as energy for vehicles. As for CH4, the H2 \n\nstorage requires specific conditions i) very high pressure gas; ii) liquid hydrogen; iii) \n\nintercalating of H2 in metals; iv) porous materials to adsorb H2.\n134 MOF materials emerged \n\nas a very strong alternative to display the role as containers for H2 due to their high surface \n\nareas. \n\n \n\n\n\nMetal-Organic Frameworks   \n\n \n\n                                                           25 \n \n\n \nFigure 1.23 \u2013 Graphics of the total volumetric (top) and gravimetric (bottom) uptakes \nfor six MOF materials. The old and new DOE targets for volumetric CH4 uptake are \nrepresented as gray lines. The target gravimetric value is 0.5 g of CH4 per gram of \nsorbent. Reproduced from reference 175. \n\n \n\n \n\n The H2 storage capacity of several known MOFs has been studied. Both small pore \n\nsizes (in order to allow the interaction of H2 with the wall of the MOF materials) and the \n\nincorporation of coordinatively unsaturated metal centers (to bind H2) are two important \n\nrequirements to retain H2 molecules. Nevertheless, other strategies have been adopted to \n\nimprove the ability of porous MOFs to uptake H2: i) postsynthetic processes;\n159 ii) \n\nvariation in the pore features;159,176-178 and iii) use of mixed crystals of known MOF \n\nmaterials prepared in different solvents.135    \n\nTo try understand about the mechanism of H2 adsorption in the pores of MOFs, \n\nBelof et al.179 evaluated how H2 binds in two indium frameworks: \n\n[In3O(C8O4H4)3(H2O)1.5(C3N2H3)(C3N2H4)0.5]\u00b7DMF\u00b70.5(CH3CN) and [In3O(C16N2O8H6)-\n\n1.5(H2O)3](H2O)3(NO3), initially prepared by Liu and collaborators (Figure 1.24).\n180 It was \n\nshown that: i) the MOF material, alongside its high surface area, has a huge number of \n\ninterdigitated pores; ii) open frameworks with low density MOFs allow H2 adsorption due \n\nto H2-H2 interactions which occur in the middle of the channels; and iii) the inner surface \n\nshould have local polar groups in order to promote MOF-H2 interactions. This last \n\ncharacteristic is directly attributed to the properties of the organic PBUs. To support that, it \n\nwas proved that the structure of Liu et al.180 containing an organic spacer with a N=N \n\nconnection provides significant MOF-H2 interactions. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n26                                                            \n \n\n \nFigure 1.24 \u2013 Ball-and-stick representation of the cuboidal cage of \n[In3O(C8O4H4)3(H2O)1.5(C3N2H3)(C3N2H4)0.5]\u00b7DMF\u00b70.5(CH3CN) (a) and [In3O-\n(C16N2O8H6)1.5(H2O)3](H2O)3(NO3) (b).

Reproduced from reference 180. \n\n \n\n \n\n Dietzel and collaborators prepared and investigated the ability of the dehydrated \n\nform of the 3D Ni-CPO-27 material towards H2 adsorption.\n149 The porosity of this material \n\nwas conserved after evacuation (at high temperatures) of the water molecules leading to an \n\nincrease of its surface area. This process improves the accessibility of H2 to the unsaturated \n\nmetal sites. The H2 uptake capacity of Ni-CPO-27 is of 1.8 wt% at 77 K.  \n\n Yaghi\u2019s group isolated twelve zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), termed ZIF-\n\n1 to -12), based on imidazolate-type organic ligands coordinated to Zn2+ or Co2+ metal \n\ncations.166 The crystalline structure of these materials consists in the net of seven distinct \n\naluminosilicates zeolites (the tetrahedral Si(Al) and the bridging O element where replaced \n\nby Zn2+ or Co2+ and the imidazolate molecules). H2 uptake experiments were performed \n\nfor both ZIF-8 and -11 showing reversible hydrogen behaviour. The H2 uptake for both \n\nmaterials was similar [145 cm3g-1 STP for ZIF-8 and 154 cm3g-1 STP for ZIF-11 (slightly \n\nhigher due to its higher surface area)]. In high-pressure (up to 80 bar) at 77 K ZIF-8 \n\nexhibited 350 cm3g-1 STP at 55 bar. \n\n NOTT-n (where n = 1, 2, 3, \u2026) porous materials, known due to their polyhedral \n\ncages with different sizes, have been prepared by the group led by Schr\u00f6der and their H2 \n\nuptake capacities have been measured. NOTT-112, -116 and -122 produced from the self-\n\nassembly of Cu2+ cations with different hexacarboxylate organic linkers showed interesting \n\nH2 uptake abilities.\n156,174 Therefore, NOTT-112, -116 and -122 have H2 uptakes of 2.3 \n\nwt%, 1.9 wt% and 2.6 wt%, respectively, at 77 K and 1 bar. Only few materials are able to \n\nadsorb amounts of H2 higher than that observed for NOTT-122 under the above mentioned \n\nconditions.174 \n\n In 2009, Mulfort et al. published a strategy to improve the H2 uptake in MOF \n\nmaterials.159 Their work consists in a post-synthesis procedure in order to convert pendent \n\nalcohols moieties to metal alkoxides (Figure 1.25). The as-prepared porous DO-MOF \n\nmaterial (having in its structure Zn2+ metallic centers and two different organic ligands: a \n\n\n\nMetal-Organic Frameworks   \n\n \n\n                                                           27 \n \n\ntetracarbolylate and a bipyridine molecules) was added to a mixture composed of THF, to \n\nreplace the guest solvent molecules of DMF, and an excess of Li+[O(CH3)3\n-] in \n\nCH3CN/THF. After that, the H2 uptake capacity of the as-prepared DO-MOF, as well as \n\nthe DO-MOF-Li, were investigated and the results suggested that at 77 K (1 atm) the DO-\n\nMOF-Li material has a higher H2 uptake (1.32 wt%) than the original DO-MOF (1.23 \n\nwt%). \n\n  \n\n \nFigure 1.25 \u2013 Schematic representation of the formation of metal alkoxides within the \nporous DO-MOF. Reproduced from reference 159. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.3.1.2. CO2 Capture \n\n  \n\nCO2 is the major responsible of the greenhouse effect in atmosphere. It is reported \n\nthat during the last half century the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere increased from \n\nabout 310 to over 380 ppm, being expected to achieve 550 ppm by 2050, even if CO2 \n\nemissions may be stabilized in the next four decades.181-183 One of the consequences of the \n\nCO2 accumulation in the atmosphere is the global warming. This environmental problem \n\nresults, mainly, of the high CO2 emission from the industries and from the combustion of \n\nfossil combustibles used in vehicles. Having into account this problem, it is important to \n\ndevelop strategies in order to decrease CO2 emissions. One was mentioned in the previous \n\ntopic (i.e., the replacement of common fossil combustibles by environmentally friendly H2 \n\nand CH4). Another alternative consists in the preparation of porous structures with high \n\naffinity to CO2 and to avoid its release for the atmosphere. The United States DOE \n\nestablished a program envisaging the retention of 90% of CO2 emissions via the post-\n\ncombustion process allowing an increase in the cost of electricity no more than 35% by \n\n2020.183 \n\nPorous MOF-based materials have been proposed to help in the resolution of this \n\nsever environmental issue. In the last two decades, MOFs have emerged as a new type of \n\nfunctional CO2 adsorbent materials and a rapid progress and extensive development in the \n\npreparation of these materials with high capacity to sequester CO2 have been \n\nobserved.31,40,44,181 MOF-based material should have some characteristics and requirements \n\ntowards CO2 adsorption: i) to be porous with good accessibility to its channels; ii) \n\nthermally stable; iii) existence of functional groups (e.g., NH2 moieties) into the pores to \n\ninteract with CO2; iv) insertion of metal ions; and v) the presence of open metal sites.\n183 \n\nAlongside these mentioned features, the low production cost of MOFs is another important \n\nrequirement envisaging their industrial availability. The reduction of CO2 emissions \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n28                                                            \n \n\ncomprises three main separation procedures, such as separation from fuel gas, power plant \n\ncombustion flows and natural gas sources.184 \n\nA huge amount of reports have described the ability of MOFs to retain considerable \n\namounts of CO2 into their channels. Among these are included some well-known \n\nstructures, such as NOTT-122 (9.0 mmol g-1),174 HKUST-1 (10.7 mmol g-1),185 MOF-5 \n\n(21.7 mmol g-1),185 MOF-117 (33.5 mmol g-1),185  MIL-100(Cr) (18.0 mmol g-1),186 MIL-\n\n101(Cr) (40.0 mmol g-1),186 NU-100 (46.4 mmol g-1),187 UMCM-1 (23.5 mmol g-1),188 \n\nMOF-200 (54.5 mmol g-1)163 and MOF-210 (54.5 mmol g-1).163 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.26 \u2013 Porous (a) ZIF-95 and (b) ZIF-100.

Nevertheless, a considerable number of scientific reports have emerged \n\nreporting the selective adsorption of CO2 over other gases (i.e., N2, CH4, O2 or CO). Thus, \n\nthis comprises binary (e.g., CO2/CO, CO2/N2 or CO2/CH4) and ternary (CO2/N2/CH4, \n\nCO2/N2/H2O or CO2N2/O2) gas mixtures.\n189-194 In 2008 Wang et al. reported two porous \n\nzeolite-type imidazolate frameworks, coined as ZIF-95 and ZIF-100, possessing very \n\ncomplex cages with 264 vertices, and constructed from about 7524 atoms (Figure 1.26).189 \n\nAfter breakthrough experiments it was reported that ZIF-95 and ZIF-100 have a great \n\nability to selectively adsorb CO2 from mixtures of CO2/CH4, CO2/CO and CO2/N2 (50:50 \n\nv/v). The average selectivities of CO2 over CH4, CO and N2 were of 4.3 : 1, 11.4 : 1 and \n\n18.0 : 1, respectively, for ZIF-95 and of 5.9 : 1, 17.3 : 1 and 25 : 1, repectively, for ZIF-\n\n100. The research group led by Yaghi employed the known porous Mg-MOF-74 material \n\nin CO2 separation processes.\n44,190 Therefore, after breakthrough experiments where it was \n\nused a mixture of CH4/CO2 (4:1) it was observed that CO2 is substantially more adsorbed \n\nthan CH4 with a dynamic capacity of 8.9 wt% CO2 uptake (Figure 1.27). It was also \n\nreported that CO2 can be easily released from the Mg-MOF-74 structure using a significant \n\nlower temperature at 80 \u00baC. \n\n\n\nMetal-Organic Frameworks   \n\n \n\n                                                           29 \n \n\n Although some MOF materials have very interesting capacity for the sequestration \n\nof CO2, enormous efforts have been done to enhance it and, consequently, to improve the \n\nselective adsorption of CO2 over other gases. A number of strategies have been developed: \n\ni) insertion of pendant moieties, as for instance, ?NH2 or \u2013OH groups in the organic \n\nPBUs;195-196 ii) preparation of MOFs with organic ligands derived of nitrogen-containing \n\nheterocycles;174,197  iii) interpenetration and catenation;198-199 and iv) exposed metal cation \n\nsites.200  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.27 \u2013 (a) Schematic representation of the preparation and structure of the as-\nprepared Mg-MOF-74-DMF and the activated Mg-MOF-74 materials (C atoms = \ngray, O atoms = red, terminal ligands and 6-coordinated Mg atoms = pink and 5-\ncoordinated Mg atoms = blue).

Heterogeneous catalysis \n  \n\nCatalysis is a research area with great and continuous importance aiming at the \n\nconversion of several chemical species, some of them dangerous to humans and the \n\nenvironment, into inoffensive products and in another cases desired molecules for \n\napplications. Alongside with the quest for porosity, application of multi-dimensional \n\nMOFs in heterogeneous catalysis has been intensely investigated. Zeolites are the most \n\ncommon materials used in industrial heterogeneous catalysis. The preparation of catalytic-\n\nactive MOFs does not aim to replace zeolite materials, but, on the contrary, to fill some \n\ngaps never achieved for this type of materials, as for instance, in enantioselective \n\nheterogeneous catalysis. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n30                                                            \n \n\nThe recyclability of a heterogeneous catalyst is one of the main objectives of \n\nresearchers working in catalytic processes. Additionally, this can be called as an eco-\n\nfriendly procedure (recycle the catalyst without loss of activity). Because several MOFs \n\nhave been shown to be good stable solid materials in many organic solvents, their \n\nrecovering after catalytic essays can be easily performed. For a MOF to have excellent \n\ncatalytic behavior it is absolutely imperative the presence of active catalytically sites from \n\nthe metal or organic molecules (Figure 1.28).22,25 Therefore, the capacity to insert \n\nfunctional groups into porous of MOFs and the presence of well-defined channels \n\n(allowing size and shape selectivity) make these materials excellent candidates for \n\nheterogeneous catalysis.201 A good MOF catalyst should have: i) functionalized organic \n\nligands to display the role, as for instance, Br\u00f6nsted acids; ii) coordinatively unsaturated \n\nmetal sites; and iii) the potentiality to incorporate metal complexes into the organic ligand \n\nand pores/channels.32 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.28 \u2013 Schematic representation of coordinatively unsaturated metal (a) and \nfunctionalized bridging organic ligands (b) as catalytic active sites. Reproduced from \nreference 22. \n\n \n\n \n\nHow is it possible to prepare organic PBUs which may introduce catalytic behavior \n\nin MOFs? Some strategies have been reported to achieve this goal, of which the most \n\nimportant are: i) immobilization of coordinative unsaturated open metal sites and ii) the \n\ninclusion of functional organic groups able to improve recognition. The advantage of the \n\nlatter strategy is that, for example, a base-type catalyst can be created because there are \n\nseveral organic functional groups which can serve as active base sites.89  \n\nHasegawa et al. synthesized an organic ligand, termed as (1,3,5-benzene \n\ntricarboxylic acid tris[N-(4-pyridyl)amide]) (4-btapa), with three amide groups as guest \n\ninteraction sites and three pyridyl groups to coordinate to metallic centers. The self-\n\nassembly of 4-btapa with Cd2+ cations gave rise to a 3D porous network, formulated as \n\n\n\nMetal-Organic Frameworks   \n\n \n\n                                                           31 \n \n\n{[Cd(4-btapa)2(NO3)2]\u00b76H2O\u00b72DMF}n. This heterogeneous catalyst was used in the \n\nKnoevenagel condensation between benzaldehyde with active methylene compounds \n\n(malononitrile, ethyl cyanoacetate and cyano-acetic acid tert-butyl ester). Obtained data \n\ndemonstrated the selective heterogeneous base catalytic properties of the MOF-based \n\ncompound, which depends on the size of the reactants: the malononitrile was a very good \n\nsubstrate, producing 98% conversion of the adduct, while the other substrates reacted \n\nnegligibly (Figure 1.29). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.29 \u2013 (a) Crystal packing of {[Cd(4-btapa)2(NO3)2]\u00b76H2O\u00b72DMF}n showing \ntheir zigzag channels.

The Mn3+ ions, belonging to the dicarboxylate chiral \n\nMn-Salen subunits, display a fundamental role in the catalytic process. The catalyst \n\nCMOF-4 revealed high capacity to afford one of the desired epoxidation products in 90% \n\nconversion and 92% ee (enantiomeric excess). Additionally, this family of materials \n\nshowed good reusability. \n\n Two years ago Gedrich et al. reported the synthesis of two chiral MOFs with wide-\n\nopen pores (> 30 \u00c5).203 These materials were prepared from reactive mixtures composed of \n\nlarge chiral tripodal carboxylate-based ligands (termed as H3ChirBTB-1 and -2, with \n\n4,4\u2019,4\u2019\u2019-benzene-1,3,5-triyltribenzoate (BTB) backbones decorated with three chiral \n\noxazolidinone substituents) and Zn(NO3)2\u00b74H2O in DEF. The resulting porous MOF \n\nmaterials, formulated as [Zn3(ChirBTB-1)2] and [Zn3(ChirBTB-2)2], were used as catalysts \n\nin Mukaiyama aldol reactions with 1-methoxy-1-(trimethylsilyloxy)-2-methyl-1-propene \n\nand benzaldehyde or 1-naphthaldehyde (Scheme 1.2). \n\n Both porous MOFs showed to be highly active Lewis acid catalysts exhibiting \n\nconsiderable enantioselectivity in the Mukaiyama aldol reactions.

Luminescence \n  \n\nThe luminescence properties of MOFs have attracted the interest of many \n\ngroups.24,33-34,103,211 Luminescence is normally used to describe the process where light is \n\nproduced by the adsorption of energy,34 and contains two basic forms: i) fluorescence \n\nwhich is spin-allowed, possessing typical lifetimes in the range from nano- to \n\nmicroseconds; and ii) phosphorescence being spin-forbidden and having lifetimes which \n\ncan reach several seconds.24 The luminescent properties comprise the following features:34 \n\n- luminescence spectra containing the fluorescence intensity as a function of a \n\nwavelength; \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n34                                                            \n \n\n- quantum yield which is traduced as the efficiency of the fluorescence process. This \n\nparameter is defined as the ratio of the number of emitted photons come from the \n\nfluorescence process in relation of the photons absorbed; \n\n- lifetime that is related with the average time in which the molecule stays in its \n\nexcited state before emitting photon. This parameter is determined as being \n\ninversely proportional to the sum rate constants of radiative and non-radiative \n\nprocesses. \n\nThe possibility to simultaneously fine-tune the organic and inorganic components \n\nallows the modification of the optical properties of the final materials. Light emission may \n\nappear either from individual organic ligands or metallic centers, or from materials \n\nresulting from their interconnection. Thus, the luminescent properties of a given MOF may \n\narise from: i) organic ligand-based luminescence, including both the phenomena ligand-to-\n\nmetal charge transfer (LMCT) and metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT); ii) adsorbate-\n\nbased emission and sensitization, the so called antenna effect; iii) surface functionalization; \n\nand iv) scintillation.24 In Figure 1.30 are depicted the luminescent phenomena observed in \n\na MOF-based material. MOFs, possessing permanent porosity, may unveil some \n\nluminescent features which are not possible to observe in other materials: \n\n- The capacity of MOF materials to accumulate molecules (as for instance, solvent \n\nmolecules) into their channels, allowing a close proximity between these and the \n\nluminescent centers, may affect the overall emission properties; \n\n- The existence of rigidity in a MOF material constrains the organic ligands in some \n\nway that may lead to an increase of the fluorescence lifetimes and quantum \n\nefficiency. This feature is not observed for free complexes in solution; \n\n- Because MOFs exist solely, their surfaces can be functionalized in solid state. This \n\nleads to new properties with potential for different optical applications. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.30 \u2013 Representation of the various luminescent phenomena observed in a \nMOF.

The metallic centers, as for instance, transition metals with unpaired electrons may be \n\nefficient quenchers. However, MOFs constructed from N- or O-donor ligands and d10-\n\nelements, as for instance ZnII or CdII, can exhibit luminescence. Metal-centered \n\nluminescence is seen in MOFs containing lanthanide ions, Ln(III), as nodes. The proximity \n\nbetween an fluorophore organic ligand and a Ln(III) ion can lead to the antenna effect \n\n(Figure 1.31) increasing the luminescence intensity.32-33 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.31 \u2013 Schematic representation of the photophysical processes involved in the \nantenna effect.

Some have \n\npotential applications as small-molecules and ions sensors, pH sensors, luminescent labels \n\nfor fluoro-immunoassays, high-technology optics, among others. 24,34,90,211-219 \n\n In 2011 the research group led by Kitagawa reported a remarkable example of a \n\nluminescent MOF. This material consists in a porous framework, [Zn2(bdc)2(dpNDI)]n,\n90 \n\nprepared from a mixture composed of benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (H2bdc) and N,N\u2019-\n\ndi(4-pyridyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenediimide (dpNDI) organic linkers and Zn(NO3)2\u00b76H2O in \n\nDMF, under solvothermal conditions. Even though the new dpNDI linker predictably has a \n\nlow fluorescence quantum yield, the authors deduced that this molecule could strongly \n\ninteract with aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOC). The obtained materials \n\nexhibited a strong color change in the visible region of the spectrum which was a \n\nconsequence of the adsorbed aromatic VOC.

Properties and Potential Applications \n \n\nInterest in metal-organophosphate chemistry began in the 1960s and 1970s with the \n\ndiscovery of crystalline zirconium phosphates and layered organophosphates.220-221 \n\nClearfield and collaborators have, undoubtedly, done a remarkable work in this field, both \n\nin the development of several phosphonate-based materials as in the publication of \n\ncomprehensive reviews, which are useful tools to understand metal phosphonates \n\nchemistry.35,220,222-227 \n\nCompared with carboxylates or N-donor ligands, phosphonates are less used for the \n\nconstruction of MOFs.228 This may be due to some factors: i) poor solubility of some \n\nphosphonate ligands; ii) the pre-disposition to form simple phosphonate structures as dense \n\nlayered materials, which makes the formation of high surface area materials a difficult \n\ntask; iii) the growth of single crystals with phosphonates is more complicated because they \n\noften precipitate rapidly giving rise to less ordered materials; and iv) when compared with \n\nother more studied coordinating groups, such as carboxylate and pyridyl, the final \n\narchitectures are less predictable because phosphonates have more possible coordination \n\nmodes and two stages of deprotonation .26,229 Nevertheless, some of these issues may be \n\nsolved: i) including some polar functional groups (as for instance, crown ether, amino, \n\ncarboxylate or hydroxyl) into the phosphonate compound or ii) introducing a second \n\norganic molecule (co-ligand) with different functional groups in order to improve the \n\nsolubility, crystallinity and the formation of 3D highly porous and robust phosphonate \n\nmaterials with open frameworks.228,230-232 Additionally, the C-PO3 bond is also stable to \n\nhigh temperatures.233 \n\n\n\nMetal-Organic Frameworks   \n\n \n\n                                                           39 \n \n\nIn the literature, it is possible to see that phosphonate-based MOFs contain, \n\nessentially, transition metals and lanthanides in their structures.231,234-236 The self-assembly \n\nof MOFs combining phosphonates with lanthanides seems to be a good choice, because the \n\nlarge number of O-donor atoms present in the organic linker fills the requirement of \n\nlanthanides which can exhibit high coordination number. This fact may lead to the \n\nformation of unusual and different architectures to those of the transition metals. In \n\naddition, the photoluminescent properties of lanthanides make them highly attractive for \n\nthe synthesis of functional MOFs.232,237 \n\nThe preparation of phosphonate-based MOFs requires the adjustment of many \n\nsynthetic variables: phosphonate and metal source, solvent, metal:P molar ratio, \n\nconcentration, pH, and, very important, reaction time and temperature. Therefore, the \n\nvariation of these reaction parameters displays a very relevant role in the final structure of \n\nMOFs.229 \n\nDue to the properties of the multifunctional phosphonate-based MOFs, these \n\nmaterials have potentiality to be applied in distinct fields, such as gas storage and \n\nseparation, ion exchange, heterogeneous catalysis and as optical sensors.  \n\n \n\n1.4.2. Examples of Functional MOFs Prepared from Phosphonate-Based \n\nOrganic Ligands \n \n\nIn section 1.3 it was described some properties and potential applications of \n\nmultidimensional MOFs prepared from carboxylates and N-donor organic ligands. \n\nNevertheless, any example of phosphonate-based MOFs was not mentioned. The research \n\ngroup in which I was working has dedicated enormous efforts in the preparation of \n\nfunctional MOFs containing phosphonate organic ligands and lanthanide ions. In the last \n\nyears I have been interested in the preparation of MOFs using lanthanides as metallic \n\ncenters and phosphonate organic linkers. These molecules were thought in order to \n\nenvisage the final structure (1D, 2D, 3D, dense or porous) and properties (i.e., catalytic \n\nbehavior, photoluminescence and adsorption) of the resulting MOF materials. \n\nIn this subsection, several examples of designed and prepared, by worldwide \n\nresearch groups, phosphonate-based molecules will be listed as well as the corresponding \n\nMOFs. Additionally, the synthesis of few examples of organic linkers, phosphonate-based-\n\nMOFs and their properties will be described in more detail. Table 1.3 lists several \n\nexamples of phosphonate-based organic linkers as well as the MOFs prepared using these \n\nmolecules and their properties. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n40                                                            \n \n\nTable 1.4 \u2013 Examples of phosphonate-based ligands designed and prepared by several \nresearch groups.

It \n\nwas found that the evacuated Ni-STA12 material has an uptake of CO2 ten times more than \n\nof CH4. This occurs due to the strong interactions of CO2 with all coordinative unsaturated \n\nNi2+ sites. A similar conclusion was found for the H2 and CO, in other words, this species \n\ncan interact with Ni2+ cations (weak Lewis acid sites).

Photoluminescence of Sm3+-, Eu3+-, Tb3+- and Dy3+-based materials were \n\nmeasured. A comparative study between hydrated and dehydrated Eu-based compounds \n\nwas performed. As expected, the hydrated sample emits less than the dehydrated one. This \n\nis due to the quenching effect from O-H groups of the water molecules. Studies also \n\nrevealed a lower emission intensity for the Sm3+-based material when compared with \n\ncompounds having Eu3+, Tb3+ and Dy3+ cations in their structure.

Outline and Main Objectives of this PhD Thesis \n\n \n\nThe scope of this PhD project is based on the preparation of functional and \n\nmultidimentional MOFs from the self-assembly of rare-earths as metallic centers with \n\nphosphonate-based organic ligands, selected and prepared by myself. Therefore, for the \n\nfirst task of this work it is proposed the synthesis of four different organic ligands (Figure \n\n1.39): \n\ni) 1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid (H4pmd): to expand the family of \n\nLanthanide-Organic Frameworks (composed by the compounds [Ce(Hpmd)(H2O)] \n\nand [Pr(Hpmd)(H2O)])\n261 initialized by the research group where I was working. \n\nThe incorporation of other lanthanide cations as, for instance the optically-active \n\nEu3+ and Tb3+, can lead to the formation of functional MOFs with luminescent \n\nproperties; \n\nii) (benzene-1,3,5-triyltris-(methylene))triphosphonic acid (H6bmt): to self-assembly \n\nwith the series of lanthanides, by using distinct synthetic approaches, to isolate \n\nnovel multidimentional MOFs with catalytic behavior and photoluminescent \n\nproperties; \n\niii) ((2,4,6-trifluorobenzene-1,3,5-triyl)tris(methylene))triphosphonic acid (H6tftp): \n\nanalogue of the H6bmt organic linker. To prepare MOF materials with the same \n\ncrystalline phase of those isolate by employing H6bmt. To assess the influence of \n\nthe replacement of C-H by C-F moieties in the photoluminescent properties of the \n\nresulting materials; \n\niv) a large tripodal organic linker, termed as H6L: to coordinate with rare-earth cations \n\nin order to isolate highly porous MOFs with adsorption and catalytic properties. \n\nBased on the literature and in previous works, it is aimed to prepare all the organic \n\nmolecules using specific synthetic routes, as for instance, Michaelis-Arbusov and catalytic \n\ncross-coupling reactions to prepare the intermediate phosphoethyl esters and acid \n\nhydrolysis to isolate the desired phosphonic acid organic ligand. The synthesis of all \n\ncompounds will be carried out using conventional heating organic methods and, always \n\npossible, microwave-assisted synthesis. The evolution of all reactions will be performed by \n\nthin layer chromatography (TLC) and the purification of the intermediates and final \n\ncompounds will be carried out by flash column chromatography and, if needed, employing \n\ncrystallization processes using adequate organic solvents. \n\nAll organic compounds will be fully characterized by standard liquid-state \n\ntechniques (NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry) and single-crystal X-ray \n\ndiffraction. \n\n\n\nMetal-Organic Frameworks   \n\n \n\n                                                           49 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.39 \u2013 Representation of the molecular structures of the phosphonic organic \nligands prepared during the PhD project. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe synthesis of the MOF materials will be based on the use of distinct synthetic \n\nmethodologies: i) hydro(solvo)thermal synthesis; ii) microwave- and ultrasound-assisted \n\nsynthesis; and iii) a bench method called \u201cone-pot\u201d synthesis. To prepare functional MOFs \n\nas phase-pure and with large crystal sizes to be studied by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, \n\nit will be necessary to optimize the various reaction parameters (i.e., reaction temperature \n\nand time, pH of the reaction solutions, solvents or mixtures of solvents, irradiation power \n\nand pressure, for the case of the microwave-assisted synthesis, among others). Materials \n\nwill be characterized by using several standard solid-state techniques (powder or single-\n\ncrystal X-ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopy (FT-IR and FT-Raman), electron \n\nmicroscopy (SEM and EDS), solid-state NMR, thermogravimetric and elemental analyses) \n\nto investigate the crystalline structure. \n\nInvestigations on the intrinsic properties of the resulting MOF materials (i.e., \n\nphotoluminescence, catalytic behavior and gas adsorption) only may possible with the \n\nclose collaboration with some researchers and group leaders expert in these scientific \n\nfields. Thus, the photoluminescent properties of the optically-active MOFs will be \n\nperformed by Dr. Duarte Ananias and the catalytic behavior of the materials will be \n\ninvestigated in the Dr. Anabela Valente\u2019s research group, both Auxiliary Researchers of \n\nthe Associated Laboratory CICECO (Department of Chemistry of the University of \n\nAveiro). Regarding to the gas adsorption properties of the porous Y3+-based MOF, these \n\nwill be investigated in collaboration with the research group led by Prof. Dr. Jorge Navarro \n\nat the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Granada (Spain). \n\nTherefore, because it is supposed to isolate functional MOFs, we propose the study \n\nof their: \n\ni) photoluminescent properties (i.e., for the materials containing optically-active \n\nlanthanide metallic centers);  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n \n\n50                                                            \n \n\nii) heterogeneous catalytic behavior, because the MOF materials are, normally, stable \n\npowdered compounds in several organic solvents. It is proposed to evaluate the \n\ncatalytic activity of the resulting MOFs in the ring-opening reaction of styrene \n\noxide with methanol; \n\niii)adsorption properties, mainly, for the MOFs construct from the large tripodal H6L \n\norganic ligand: to investigate their abilities, as for instance, for selective gas \n\nseparation processes using binary (e.g., C3H6/ C3H8 and CO2/C2H2) and ternary \n\n(e.g., CO2/C2H2/CH4 and CO2/C2H2/N2) gas mixtures.  \n\n\n\nMetal-Organic Frameworks   \n\n \n\n                                                           51 \n \n\n1.6.

Introduction \n\n \n\nOrganophosphorus compounds are a family of organic molecules possessing \n\ncarbon-phosphorus (C?P) bonds. The first organophosphorus molecules emerged for the \n\nfirst time in the middle ages. This family of compounds was in 1820 systematically studied \n\nby Lassaigne while performing the phosphoric acid esterification. Several years later, \n\nThinard\u2019s group isolates a series of phosphine derivatives and after this work the progress \n\nin the phosphorous-based organic molecules was very fast. Therefore, in the middle of the \n\nXIX century, this field of research was dominated by A. Michaelis, being then continued \n\nby A. E. Arbusov and his son B. A. Arbusov. The latter, in collaboration with some British \n\nand German researchers, continued the evolution of this area. Some properties of this type \n\nof organophosphorus compounds, as for instance, toxicity and the possibility to be used as \n\ninsecticides were discovered in 1930 by Shrader and co-workers, being, then, industrially \n\nproduced. Later, in 1949, the chemistry of the organophosphorus compounds was studied \n\nby G. M. Kosolapoff. Coffey reviewed recently this type of chemistry.\n1-3\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1.1. Structure, Properties and Applications of Phosphonic Acids and \n\nEster Derivatives \n\n  \n\nPhosphonic acid compounds have been described as phosphoric acid derivatives. \n\nThe difference resides in the replacement of a hydroxyl group by an organic substituent (R \n\n= aryl or alkyl), with RPO3H2 as general formula: the phosphorous atom, in this case, is \n\npentavalent connected to three atoms (two oxygens and one R) by simple bonds and to one \n\noxygen by one double bond. Additionally, the phosphorous of phosphonic acids has sp\n3\n \n\nhybridization conferring it a close tetrahedral geometry.\n4-5\n\n In Figure 2.1 it is represented \n\nthe molecular formula of the phosphonic acid (as well as its geometry), phosphonate \n\n(deprotonated form of the phosphonic acid) and the ester of the phosphonic acid. \n\nRegarding to the acidic properties of the phosphonic acids, acidity of the first proton can \n\nvary in a pKa1 range between 0.5 and approximately 3, while for the second proton the pKa2 \n\nvalue is comprised in the 5-9 range. This variation in the pKa1 and pKa2 values may be \n\nbased on the presence of some electron-donating (EDG) or/and electron-withdrawing \n\n(EWG) groups.\n4\n \n\n Due to their properties, phosphonic acids have found applications in distinct areas \n\nsuch as: organic synthesis reactants, antioxidants of industrial oils, production of non-\n\nflammable plastics, surface applications to prevent corrosion processes, as agrochemicals \n\n(i.e., insecticides, herbicides and fungicides) and for medical purposes (antitumor, anti-\n\nhepatitis B and -HIV virus and in clinical dentistry).\n4-8\n\n In Figure 2.2 are depicted some of \n\nthe commercially available phosphonate-based and phosphonic acid compounds which \n\nhave been employed in different fields: i) phosphonoformic acid (Foscavir\n\u00ae\n) an antiviral \n\nagent; ii) the herbicide N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine (Roundup\n\u00ae\n); iii) 3-amino-1-\n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n66                                                            \n\n \n\nhydroxypropanediyl-1,1-bis-phosphonic acid (Aredia\n\u00ae\n\n) a medical drug for hypercalcemia \n\ntreatment; and iv) (R)-1-6-aminopurin-9-yl)propan-2-yloxymethylphosphonic acid \n\n(Viread\n\u00ae\n).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 \u2013 General structure of the phosphonic acid group, illustrating its tetrahedral \n\ngeometry, phosphonate and ester of phosphonic acid. \n\n \n\n \n\nPhosphonic acid-based organic molecules have been employed in the synthesis of \n\nmetal phosphonate-based compounds. Alberti and collaborators reported in 1978 for the \n\nfirst time this type of compounds consisting in zirconium phosphonate layered structures \n\nformulated as [Zr(HOCH2PO3)2]\u00b7H2O, [Zr(C2H6PO3)] and [Zr(C6H6PO3)].\n9\n Since then, the \n\ninterest in the preparation of metal phosphonate chemistry have been substantially \n\nincreased.\n10\n\n The physical and chemical properties of organophosphorus compounds, \n\nespecially phosphonate-based or phosphonic acid organic molecules, led us to employ \n\nenormous efforts in their preparation for the construction of multidimensional Metal-\n\nOrganic Frameworks (MOFs). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 \u2013 Molecular structures of the commercially available Foscavir\n\u00ae\n, \n\nRoundup\n\u00ae\n, Aredia\n\n\u00ae\n and Viread\n\n\u00ae\n used in different fields. \n\n \n\n\n\nBi- and Tripodal Phosphonate Organic Ligands \n\n                                                        67 \n\n \n\n2.1.2. Synthetic Methods to Prepare Phosphonic Acid Linkers and their \n\nPhosphonate Intermediates \n\n  \n\nIn an historical prespective, and as mentioned above, we must go back to the XIX \n\ncentury, more precisely in 1897, date on which Michaelis and Becker reported the \n\ngeneration of a carbon-phosphorous (C?P) bond, involving the phosphorylation, by using \n\nsalts of dialkylphosphites, of a saturated carbon under heating.\n11-13\n\n Since then, this type of \n\nnucleophilic phosphorylation has been used and improved in order to prepare new \n\nphosphonate-based organic ligands in high yields. Therefore, in the literature it is \n\ncommonly found several synthetic methodologies in order to isolate phosphonated \n\ncompounds, such as: i) Michaelis-Arbusov reaction; ii) Michaelis-Becker reaction; iii) \n\nMannich-type condensation; and iv) catalytic cross-coupling reaction (nickel or \n\npalladium). In the next sub-sections, it is only highlighted and described the Michaelis-\n\nArbusov reaction and the catalytic cross-coupling method, using palladium as catalyst. It is \n\nalso describe the transformation of the dialkyl phosphonate intermediates into organic \n\nphosphonic acids. \n\n \n\nMichaelis-Arbusov Reaction \n\n This type of reaction has been reported in several articles and reviews since 1949, \n\nbeing used very often in the synthesis of new phosphonate-based organic compounds .\n14-19\n\n \n\nThe Michaelis-Arbusov reaction is one of the most versatile synthetic routes to produce \n\nC?P bonds, involving the reaction of an primary alkyl halide, possessing commonly Cl, Br \n\nor I elements, with trialkyl phosphite, with the formula P(OR)3 [where R = ?CH3, \n\n?CH2CH3, ?CH(CH3)2, and others]. This reaction is normally performed at 110-200 \u00baC, \n\ndepending of the R group and used solvents as, for instance, toluene or xylene,\n17-18,20\n\n being \n\nmore common its use without organic solvents. Normally, the trialkyl phosphite has been \n\nused as reagent and solvent.  \n\n \n\nScheme 2.1 \u2013 Schematic representation of the mechanism of the Michaelis-Arbusov \n\nreaction. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n68                                                            \n\n \n\nMechanistically, the Michaelis-Arbusov reaction comprises two reaction steps \n\n(Scheme 2.1). First, a nucleophilic attack (SN2) of the trialkyl phosphite, promoted by the \n\nfree electron pair present in the phosphorus atom, to the ?-carbon of the alkyl halide. This \n\nphenomenon leads to the formation of an ionic phosphonium salt intermediate and a halide \n\nanion. Then, because the phosphonium intermediate is unstable under heat, the halide \n\nanion, being the leaving group in the first reaction step and acting as a nucleophile in the \n\nsecond one, attacks one carbon that is directly connected to oxygen of one of the alkoxy \n\ngroups (in a SN2 reaction) affording the phosphonate ester. In summary, during this \n\ntransformation the trivalent phosphorus is converted in a pentavalent one.\n4,12,21\n\n \n\n \n\nCatalytic Cross-coupling Reaction \n\n The general main objective of a transition metal-catalyzed organic synthesis \n\ncomprises the formation of a carbon-carbon (C?C) bond. The Pd-catalyzed coupling \n\nreaction is one of the most employed and efficient methodologies regarding the \n\nconstruction of C?C bonds. In addition to Pd-catalysts (e.g., Pd(OAc)2 and [Pd(PPh3)4]), \n\ntransition metal-catalysts (as for instance, NiBr2 and NiCl2) have also been extensively \n\nused for the formation of carbon-phosphorus (C?P) and carbon-boron (C?B) bonds in \n\norder to produce respective aryl or alkenyl phosphonate or boronic acid organic \n\nmolecules.\n22-25\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nScheme 2.2 \u2013 Schematic representation of the mechanism of palladium-catalyzed \n\ncross-coupling. \n\n\n\nBi- and Tripodal Phosphonate Organic Ligands \n\n                                                        69 \n\n \n\nContrary to what happens in the Michaelis-Arbusov approach, involving the use of \n\nprimary alkyl halide, the reaction between alkenyl or aryl halides with trialkyl phosphite \n\ndoes not occur because the halide is an electrophilic poor molecule. The use of a transition \n\nmetal-catalyst is required. \n\n Catalytic cross-coupling reaction is complicated involving three main steps: i) \n\noxidative addition; ii) transmetalation; and iii) reductive elimination (Scheme 2.2). In \n\naddition, electronic and steric features of the organic halides, the palladium source as well \n\nas the anionic additives and ligands display a very important role in the success of the \n\nformation of the C?P bond. Therefore, mechanistically the catalytic cross-coupling \n\nreaction starts with the formation of an active Pd\n0\n complex. Then, it arises a palladium \n\ncomplex due to the oxidative addition of an aryl or alkenyl substrate. Pd becomes Pd\nII\n. In \n\nthe next step, the trialkyl phosphite coordinates to the metal center giving rise to a new \n\npalladium complex (ligand?phosphite?Pd\nII\n-aryl (or alkenyl) complex) and to the \n\nconsequent formation of a Pd?P bond. Finally, in the last step a reductive elimination \n\noccurred, being the Pd\n0\n regenerated and the C?P bond formed in order to isolate the \n\ndesired organic phosphonic ligand.\n4,12\n\n \n\n \n\nFrom Phosphonate Intermediates to the Final Acid Phosphonic Organic Compounds \n\nThe transformation of the dialkyl phosphonates into the respective phosphonic acid \n\ncompounds is a relatively simple step. This methodology comprises a conventional acid \n\nhydrolysis from the preparation of a reaction mixture containing the dialkyl phosphonate \n\nintermediate with an aqueous solution of HCl (6 M) or even concentrated HCl (Scheme \n\n2.3). The solution is refluxed during few to several hours depending of the number of \n\nexisting phosphonate groups and/or the complexity of the organic molecule.\n21,24,26\n\n \n27\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nScheme 2.3 \u2013 Acid hydrolysis of the dialkyl phosphonates to isolate the desired \n\nphosphonic acid organic linkers. \n\n \n\n \n\nThis chapter only focus the synthesis of four phosphonic organic ligands: i) the \n\ndipodal 1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid (H4pmd); ii) the tripodal \n\n(benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))tri-phosphonic acid (H6bmt); iii) the fluorinated \n\ntripodal ((2,4,6-trifluorobenzene-1,3,5-triyl)tris(methylene))-triphosphonic acid (H6tftp); \n\nand iv) the large tripodal H6L (depicted in Figure 1.39 of the Chapter 1). All synthetic \n\nroutes, purification processes and characterization (NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry \n\nand single-crystal X-ray diffraction) are described in detail.   \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n70                                                            \n\n \n\n2.2. Strategy \n \n\nOur research group initialized the quest for MOF materials composed of highly \n\nflexible and aliphatic carboxylate organic molecules obtained commercially. Nevertheless, \n\nand progressing in time, the carboxylate groups have been replaced by phosphonate ones \n\n(Figure 2.3).\n28-37\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 \u2013 Highly flexible and aliphatic carboxylate and/or phosphonate organic \n\nligands used for our research group to prepare MOFs. \n\n \n\n \n\nFrom these previous investigations it was possible to draw some conclusions: \n\n(i) the presence of central nitrogen atom core together with methylene groups, \n\ndespite being a suitable moiety to employ in divergent tripodal organic PBUs, \n\npromotes a high degree of flexibility of the organic molecule and consequently \n\nsupramolecular isomerism. This fact, may be related with the preparation of \n\nmicrocrystalline MOF powders;  \n\n(ii) two-dimensional MOF materials are usually isolated because the organic PBUs \n\nact as chelating agents of the metal cations and branching is only facilitated in two \n\ndirections of the space;  \n\n(iii) because many of these previously reported structures contain f-block elements, \n\nwe observed that the absence of suitable sensitizers in the organic PBUs (e.g., \n\naromatic rings) led to poor photoluminescent properties. To boost emission of the \n\nisolated Lanthanide\u2013Organic Frameworks (LnOFs) specific groups have to be \n\nincluded, such as aromatic rings, so as to promote an effective antenna effect;  \n\n\n\nBi- and Tripodal Phosphonate Organic Ligands \n\n                                                        71 \n\n \n\n(iv) in addition, the central nitrogen atom appears protonated in the synthesized \n\nMOF structures (as also occurs in the zwitterionic forms of the starting organic \n\nPBUs), which constitutes an additional quencher (non-radiative) of the \n\nphotoluminescent properties. \n\nComparing carboxylic with phosphonic acids ligands, the latter are more acidic, the \n\nnumber of electrons is twice higher and they are non-planar possessing tetrahedral \n\ngeometry. This set of characteristics allows the formation of stronger hydrogen bonds, \n\nbeing a very good request for the design of crystalline structures and for the self-assembly \n\nof supramolecular arrays.\n10\n\n \n\nKeeping into account all these information, we have done enormous efforts towards \n\nthe preparation of di- and tripodal aromatic phosphonate-based molecules. With that we \n\nprospect the construction of multidimensional MOF materials aiming the improvement of \n\ntheir final properties (e.g., photoluminescence).  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3. 1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid (H4pmd) \n\n \n\n2.3.1. Synthesis \n\n \n\n1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid (H4pmd) linker was for the first \n\ntime used by our group for the preparation of LnOFs. In 2008 it was reported the synthesis \n\nof two layered LnOFs, formulated as [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] (Ln\n3+\n\n = Ce\n3+\n\n and Pr\n3+\n\n) based on \n\nH4pmd.\n38\n\n In that work, H4pmd was generated in situ, involving the use of ionic liquids \n\nfrom his tetraethyl ester derivative 1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)bisphosphonate \n\n(commercially available). Although being novel, the method proved to be difficult and the \n\nextension for other lanthanides it was not possible to perform. \n\nThe H4pmd organic linker was herein isolated using a different synthetic route. An \n\naqueous suspension composed of HCl (6M) with the commercially available tetraethyl 1,4-\n\nphenylenebis(methylene)-bisphosphonate was prepared and refluxed for 20 h (Scheme \n\n2.4). The solvent was completely distilled and the desired linker, 1,4-\n\nphenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid (H4pmd), was obtained as crystalline white \n\npowder with 96% yield (see the Experimental Section for further details). \n\n \n\n \n\nScheme 2.4 - Synthetic route to 1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid \n\n(H4pmd). \n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n72                                                            \n\n \n\n2.3.2. Structural Elucidation  \n\n  \n\nTo confirm the structure of the 1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid \n\n(H4pmd) organic molecule it was collected the respective \n1\nH, \n\n13\nC and \n\n31\nP NMR spectra \n\nusing DMSO-d6 as solvent. Analyzing the \n1\nH spectrum, it is observed one doublet \n\n(J(\n1\nH?\n\n31\nP) = 19.9 Hz) at ? 2.91 ppm corresponding to the resonance of the protons of the \n\nmethylene (\u2013CH2) group with the phosphorous belonging to the \u2013PO3H2 groups. In the \n\naromatic zone appears one singlet at 7.15 ppm corresponding to the aromatic protons. In \n\nthe \n13\n\nC NMR spectrum at ? 35.0 ppm it is observed a doublet (J(\n13\n\nC?\n31\n\nP) = 132.6 Hz) \n\nwhich is related with the resonance of the carbons belonging to the \u2013CH2 groups with \n\nphosphorous. At ? 129.4 and 131.8 ppm are presented the aromatic \u2013CH and the aromatic \n\n\u2013C\u2013CH2, respectively. The \n31\n\nP NMR spectrum only has one triplet (J(\n31\n\nP?\n1\nH) = 22.2 Hz) \n\ncentered at ? 21.7 ppm resulting to the coupling between the phosphorous with the protons \n\nof the methylene moiety.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4. (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic acid (H6bmt) \n\n \n\n2.4.1. Synthesis \n\n \n\nThe synthesis and structural characterization of the tripodal (benzene-1,3,5-triyltris-\n\n(methylene))triphosphonic acid (H6bmt), as well as its phosphohexaethyl ester derivative, \n\nhas been previously reported in several works.\n4,6-8,26,39-41\n\n Its use has been focused for the \n\npreparation of mesostructured organosilica hybrids, to assembly to fullerene (C60), as \n\norganic unities for the synthesis of dendrimers and, only once, for the synthesis of a MOF \n\nmaterial. \n\n \n\nMichaelis-Arbusov reaction \n\nBased on the literature, our first attempts were based on the preparation of some \n\nreaction mixtures composed of the commercially available 1,3,5-tris(bromomethyl)-\n\nbenzene and triethyl phosphite in dry toluene or xylene. The solutions were refluxed, under \n\nconstant magnetic stirring, during large periods of time (ranging from 18 h to 3 days). \n\nAlthough we isolated the desired organic molecule (IL\n1\n, see scheme 2.5), reactions were \n\nvery slow and IL\n1\n was obtained in low yields. \n\nThe synthetic procedure was modified to a Michaelis\u2013Arbusov reaction: mixture \n\ncomposed of 1,3,5-tris-(bromomethyl)benzene\n42\n\n with triethyl phosphite (acting as reactant \n\nand solvent).\n26,41\n\n The reaction occurred at 120 \u00baC during 12 h (see Experimental Section \n\nfor further details). Upon completion of the reaction, the excess of triethyl phosphite was \n\nremoved by distillation under reduced pressure (Caution! triethyl phosphite has an \n\nextremely unpleasant smell and it is harmful; it should be, therefore, always handled inside \n\na fume hood). The intermediate compound IL\n1\n [hexaethyl(benzene-1,3,5-triyltris-\n\n\n\nBi- and Tripodal Phosphonate Organic Ligands \n\n                                                        73 \n\n \n\n(methylene))tris(phosphonate)] was purified by flash column chromatography and isolated \n\nas a colorless oil in a very good yield (88%).  \n\n \n\nScheme 2.5 - Synthetic route to (benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic acid \n\n(H6bmt). \n\n \n\n \n\nAcid hydrolysis \n\nThe second step, in order to isolate H6bmt, was based on an acid hydrolysis \n\nreaction: IL\n1\n was treated with an aqueous solution of HCl for 20 h at reflux. The resulting \n\nsolution was washed with dichloromethane and H6bmt was immediately isolated as a white \n\ncrystalline solid, being washed with acetone. H6bmt was obtained in 92% yield. \n\n \n\n2.4.2. Structural Elucidation \n\n  \n\nThe intermediate [hexaethyl(benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))tris(phosphonate)] \n\n(IL\n1\n) and the desired (benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic acid (H6bmt) \n\norganic compounds were both characterized by NMR spectroscopy using CDCl3 and \n\nDMSO-d6, respectively. IL\n1\n and H6bmt were investigated by TOF MS ES\n\n+\n and TOF MS \n\nES\n-\nmass spectrometry, respectively. \n\n1\nH NMR spectrum of IL\n\n1\n comprises at ? 1.22 ppm a \n\nsignal representing one triplet (J(\n1\nH\u2013\n\n1\nH) = 7.1 Hz) corresponding to the protons of the \n\nmethyl (?CH3) group (Figure 2.4). At ? 3.08 ppm appears one doublet (J(\n1\nH\u2013\n\n31\nP) = 22.1 \n\nHz) attributed to the protons of the methylene group identified as \u2013CH2\u2013P and the \n\nresonances of the two protons of the other methylene group, identified as \u2013O\u2013CH2 is \n\nlocated at ? 4.00 ppm as a double quartet (J(\n1\nH\u2013\n\n1\nH) = 7.2 Hz and J(\n\n1\nH\u2013\n\n31\nP) = 7.9 Hz). \n\nRegarding to the aromatic of the spectrum we highlight a double triplet (\n4\nJ(\n\n1\nH\u2013\n\n1\nH) = \n\n4\nJ(\n\n1\nH\u2013\n\n31\nP) = 2.4 Hz) at ? 7.10 ppm corresponding to the resonance of the three aromatic \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n74                                                            \n\n \n\nprotons. In the \n13\n\nC NMR spectrum of IL\n1\n the resonance of the carbon belonging the methyl \n\ngroup (\u2013CH3) is located in the ? 16.2\u201316.3 ppm range.

Reactions were performed at different temperatures (ambient or refluxing) \n\nvarying the period of time (from 5 to 18 h), because the conversion of the starting material \n\noccurred very slowly.

This step \n\ninvolves a Michaelis-Arbusov reaction catalyzed by NiCl2, NiBr2 or [Pd(PPh3)4] taking \n\nfrom 1 to 6 days to be completed and, normally, high temperatures are required. \n\nNevertheless, the intermediate compound of H6L is isolated in high yields (80-90%). The \n\nsecond, and final, step towards the isolation of H6L is based on an acid hydrolysis, \n\n\n\nBi- and Tripodal Phosphonate Organic Ligands \n\n                                                        81 \n\n \n\nrefluxing an aqueous solution of concentrated HCl during some hours. The desired \n\ncompound is obtained from very high to quantitative yields. \n\n \n\nPd-catalyzed Cross-coupling reaction  \n\n Commercially available 1,3,5-tris(4-bromo phenyl)benzene and [Pd(PPh3)4] were \n\nadded in a round-bottom flask containing triethyl phosphite. The resulting reaction mixture \n\nwas refluxed, under N2 atmosphere, on a sand bath for approximately 48 h. After cooling \n\nto ambient temperature, the resulting dark solution was placed under reduced pressure in \n\norder to remove the excess of triethyl phosphite. The resulting residue was purified by \n\nflash column chromatography using dichloromethane/methanol (97%/3%) as eluent. The \n\nphosphohexaethyl ester intermediate IL\n4\n organic molecule was obtained as a yellow and \n\nviscous oil, becoming a powder, in 53% yield, when dried under vacuum.  \n\nThe quest for faster synthetic approaches and better reaction yields, led to the use of \n\nthe microwave-assisted approach to isolate the intermediate hexaethyl ester of H6L. \n\nExperiments were performed in an Ethos SYNTH microwave labstation (Milestone Inc.) \n\napparatus, by using glassware setup for atmospheric-pressure reactions (temperature \n\nmeasured with a fiber-optic probe). A reaction mixture composed of 1,3,5-tris(4-\n\nbromophenil)benzene, [Pd(PPh3)4] and triethyl phosphite were added to a two-neck flask \n\nfitted with a reflux condenser and a temperature probe. The reaction mixture, under N2 \n\natmosphere, was irradiated using different powers (400, 500, 600, 700 and 800 W). \n\nNevertheless, even using 800 W of power, the desired temperature was not achieved. \n\nTherefore, a weflon bar was placed into the reaction medium and in this way it was \n\npossible to reflux the reaction mixture [triethyl phosphite (used as reagent and solvent) \n\ndoes not absorb very well the microwave irradiation, becoming the heating process very \n\ndifficult or, even, impossible in order to reach the desired temperature]. During our \n\nattempts the reaction time was also varied (ranging from 1 to 6 h). However, controlling, \n\nfrequently, the reaction by TLC it was observed that almost all starting reagent was not \n\nconverted. \n\n Other microwave-assisted equipment was tested: CEM Focused Microwave \n\nSynthesis System Discover S-Class apparatus. After some experiments, this equipment was \n\nselected as the best choice for the preparation of the hexaethyl ester intermediate of H6L \n\n(IL\n4\n). The first step involved a Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction (Scheme 2.7). A \n\nreaction mixture composed of 1,3,5-tris(4-bromophenyl)benzene, [Pd(PPh3)4] and triethyl \n\nphosphite was prepared inside a 10 mL IntelliVent microwave reactor and refluxed, using a \n\nweflon bar (see Experimental Section for further details). When the reaction was \n\ncompleted, the excess of triethyl phosphite was distilled under reduced pressure and the \n\nhexaethyl ester intermediate IL\n4\n was purified by flash column chromatography using a \n\nmixture of dichloromethane/methanol (97%:3%) as eluent. The obtained oily residue was \n\nwashed with petroleum ether in an ultrasonic bath affording the target compound as a \n\nwhite powder in 83% yield. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n82                                                            \n\n \n\nAcid hydrolysis \n\nThe second reaction step was based on an acid hydrolysis. The reaction started by \n\npreparing a mixture composed of an aqueous solution of HCl (6 M) and the intermediate \n\nIL\n4 \n\ncompound and kept it under reflux for 2 days. After characterization by NMR \n\nspectroscopy, the NMR spectra suggest us that the hydrolysis was incomplete.  \n\nThen, the intermediate IL\n4 \n\ncompound was mixed with an aqueous solution of \n\nconcentrated HCl and the mixture was refluxed for 2 days, under constant magnetic stirring \n\n(Scheme 2.7). The reaction was stopped after the formation of a brownish viscous residue. \n\nThe resulting mixture was washed with dichloromethane (to extract some organic \n\nimpurities or secondary less polar compounds) and the brownish viscous residue was \n\ndissolved with methanol. After distillation of methanol, we obtained again a brownish \n\nviscous residue which was redissolved in methanol, adding then dry toluene and dry \n\nhexane (1:1). This procedure aims at a more efficient drying of the desired compound. It \n\nafforded the formation of a yellowish foam which was dissolved in a small amount of dry \n\nmethanol giving raise H6L as a white powder in a 93% yield (see Experimental Section for \n\nfurther details). \n\n \n\n2.6.2. Structural Elucidation \n\n \n\nThe intermediate IL\n4\n compound and the desired large tripodal organic linker H6L, \n\nobtained as crystalline compounds, allowed us to solve their crystal structure by single-\n\ncrystal X-ray diffraction (Figures 2.10 and 2.11). Both compounds were also characterized \n\nby NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.10 - Molecular structure of the intermediate molecule IL\n4\n. Displacement \n\nellipsoids are drawn at the 30% probability level. \n\n\n\nBi- and Tripodal Phosphonate Organic Ligands \n\n                                                        83 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.11 - Molecular structure of the large tripodal H6L organic linker. \n\nDisplacement ellipsoids are drawn at the 80% probability level. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe \n1\nH NMR spectrum of IL\n\n4\n shows, in the aliphatic region, a resonance signal as a \n\ntriplet (J(\n1\nH-\n\n1\nH) = 7.1 Hz) centered at ? 1.36 ppm attributed to the protons of the methyl \n\ngroups. Between ? 4.12 and 4.21 ppm there is a multiplet corresponding to the protons of \n\nthe methylene moieties. In the aromatic region it is possible to observe: i) between ? 7.77 \n\nand 7.81 ppm a multiplet belonging to the resonance of the H3 protons; ii) a singlet at ? \n\n7.83 ppm attributed to the three H6 aromatic protons located in the central ring; and iii) \n\nanother multiplet between ? 7.91 and 7.98 ppm corresponding to H2 protons (Figure 2.12). \n\nThe \n13\n\nC NMR spectrum provides several signals belonging to the IL\n4\n intermediate \n\nmolecule. At ? 16.3 ppm there is the signal of the methyl groups as a doublet (J(\n13\n\nC-\n31\n\nP) = \n\n6.3 Hz) and at ? 62.2 ppm the resonance of the methylene groups also as a doublet (J(\n13\n\nC-\n31\n\nP) = 5.5 Hz). At higher chemical shifts the spectrum has several and very close peaks, \n\nbeing difficult their assignment: 126.1, 126.9, 127.3 (d, J(\n13\n\nC-\n31\n\nP) = 15.2 Hz), 132.4 (d, \n\nJ(\n13\n\nC-\n31\n\nP) = 10.2 Hz), 141.6 and 144.4 (J(\n13\n\nC-\n31\n\nP) = 3.0 Hz). In the TOF MS ES\n+\n spectrum \n\nwe can observe two peaks of IL\n4\n at m/z: 715.2 (M+H)\n\n+\n and 737.2 (M+Na)\n\n+\n. \n\nThe \n1\nH NMR spectrum only provides, as expected, resonance signals of the H6L \n\norganic linker in the aromatic region. Therefore, between ? 7.78 and 7.85 ppm it is possible \n\nto find the resonances of the H3 protons as a multiplet. The H2 protons are located, as a \n\nmultiplet, between ? 7.97 and 8.10 ppm (being the last peak overlapped). The remaining \n\nresonance appears as a singlet at ? 8.01 ppm corresponding to the H6 protons. As \n\nmentioned in the description of the \n1\nH NMR spectrum, in the \n\n13\nC NMR spectrum of H6L it \n\nis only observed resonance signals in the aromatic region: 125.2, 127.0 (d, J(\n13\n\nC-\n31\n\nP) = \n\n14.3 Hz), 131.2 (d, J(\n13\n\nC-\n31\n\nP) = 10.0 Hz), 132.1, 134.5, 141.1 and 142.2 (d, J(\n13\n\nC-\n31\n\nP) = \n\n2.8 Hz). The \n31\n\nP NMR spectrum of H6L possesses only a resonance as a multiplet between \n\n? 13.7 and 14.0. After analysis of the high-resolution ESI mass spectrum it is possible to \n\nobserve one peak at m/z 547.0464 (M+H)\n+\n, which identifies the protonated form of the H6L \n\norganic ligand. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n84                                                            \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.12 - \n1\nH NMR spectrum of the intermediate compound IL\n\n4\n. \n\n  \n\n \n\n2.7. Results and Discussion \n \n\nIn this chapter it was documented in detail the synthetic procedures to prepare four \n\ndifferent phosphonic acid organic linkers to be used for the preparation of \n\nmultidimensional MOFs. The organic ligand 1,4-phenylenebis-(methylene)diphosphonic \n\nacid (H4pmd) was isolated via an acid hydrolysis using an aqueous solution of HCl (6 M). \n\nThe work-up of the reaction was simple, being only performed a liquid-liquid extraction \n\nusing dichloromethane in order to remove some nonpolar impurities. After evaporation of \n\nthe solvent, under reduced pressure, and washing with acetone, the desired compound was \n\nobtained in quantitative yields (96%). \n\nMore complex was the synthesis of the tripodal organic compound (benzene-1,3,5-\n\ntriyltris(methylene))tri-phosphonic acid (H6bmt). Its preparation started with a Michaelis-\n\nArbusov reaction by preparing a reaction mixture containing 1,3,5-tris-\n\n(bromomethyl)benzene with triethyl phosphite. The latter reagent was added in excess \n\nacting as reactant and solvent. After purification the intermediate [hexaethyl(benzene-\n\n1,3,5-triyltris-(methylene))tris(phosphonate)] (IL\n1\n) compound was obtained, as a colorless \n\noil, in 88% yield. After optimization of the reaction conditions, the synthetic route became \n\nquite simple and IL\n1 \n\ncan be prepared in large amounts in period of time not so long. The \n\nsecond step, in order to isolate the desired H6bmt organic ligand, consists, as for H4pmd, \n\nin an acid hydrolysis using an aqueous solution of HCl (6 M). The work-up, washing and \n\n\n\nBi- and Tripodal Phosphonate Organic Ligands \n\n                                                        85 \n\n \n\ndrying process to obtain H6bmt was very similar as for H4pmd, and the resulting \n\ncompound was obtained in 92% yield. \n\nThe preparation of the fluorinated tripodal ((2,4,6-trifluorobenzene-1,3,5-triyl)tris-\n\n(methylene))triphosphonic acid (H6tftp) linker comprised a three-step reaction: i) \n\nchloromethylation reaction; ii) Michaelis-Arbusov reaction; and iii) acid hydrolysis. The \n\nchloromethylation method is a kind of Friedel-Crafts reaction, consisting in an aromatic \n\nelectrophilic substitution using aluminium chloride (AlCl3) as catalyst. This reaction \n\nstarted with the preparation of a reactive mixture composed of 1,3,5-trifluorobenzene, \n\nchloromethyl methyl ether (used in excess displaying the role of reactant and solvent) and \n\nAlCl3. This reaction required care: i) the constant use of gloves and laboratory glasses; ii) \n\nthe handling of AlCl3 (explosive when in contact with water and in humid atmospheres, \n\nthis reactant become highly acid), and chloromethyl methyl ether (it has toxicity and \n\ncarcinogenic features) always inside a hood fume. The chloromethylation reaction \n\nemployed to prepare the intermediate compound 1,3,5-tris(chloromethyl)-2,4,6-\n\ntrifluorobenzene (IL\n2\n) afforded several secondary products. The intermediate IL\n\n2\n \n\ncompound\n \n(purified by flash column chromatography) was obtained in 71% yield. The \n\nsynthetic methodologies to isolate hexaethyl((2,4,6-trifluorobenzene-1,3,5-\n\ntriyl)tris(methylene))tris-(phosphonate) (IL\n3\n) and H6tftp consists in a Michaelis-Arbusov \n\nreaction and an acid hydrolysis, respectively. The procedures to perform both reactions \n\nwere very similar to that described for H6bmt. The intermediate IL\n3\n and the desired H6tftp \n\nwere obtained in 75% and 98% yields, respectively. \n\nThe fourth organic linker prepared during this work was the large tripodal H6L. Its \n\nsynthesis comprises a Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction and an acid hydrolysis. At the \n\nbeginning the intermediate compound IL\n4\n, prepared from a reactive mixture composed of \n\n1,3,5-tris(4-bromophenil)benzene, [Pd(PPh3)4] and triethyl phosphite, using conventional \n\nheating methods, was isolated in low reaction yields and the reaction took large periods of \n\ntime. Nevertheless, changing this method for a simpler and economical-friendly approach, \n\nin this case microwave-assisted synthesis, IL\n4\n was obtained in a faster way and in much \n\nhigher yields (83%). The employed high temperatures, the pressure (100 psi) generated \n\ninside the reactor seems to be the key reaction parameter to prepare IL\n4\n in a quickly way \n\nand in large amounts. The second step was based on an acid hydrolysis. The procedure to \n\nperform this reaction suffers some modifications when compared for that to obtain H4pmd, \n\nH6bmt and H6tftp. The hydrolysis of IL\n4\n was carried out using concentrated HCl (12 M) \n\ninstead an aqueous solution of HCl (6 M) and the period of time required was longer (2 \n\ndays). This fact may be attributed to the increase of the non-polarity of the intermediated \n\nphosphohexaethyl ester IL\n4\n, once this has four aromatic rings instead of one as H4pmd, \n\nH6bmt and H6tftp. The work-up of the final reaction mixture was performed in similar \n\nfashion to those of previous organic linkers. To isolate the large tripodal H6L as white \n\npowder it was needed to use a particular drying procedure (a mixture of dried hexane and \n\ndried toluene). H6L was obtained in a high reaction yield (93%). \n\nRegarding all the employed synthetic routes reported in this chapter, one can \n\nconclude that they are good choices to isolate phosphohexaethyl ester intermediates and \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n86                                                            \n\n \n\nthe corresponding phosphonic acid organic linkers in short periods of time and with high \n\nreaction yields:  \n\ni) the Michaelis-Arbusov method, a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction, is a very \n\nsimple and efficient alternative to prepare phosphohexaethyl ester intermediates, \n\nwhich does not represent any risk for the human health. The use of triethyl \n\nphosphite as solvent and reactant at the same time, allows the synthesis of those \n\nintermediate compounds in a fast way, high yields and without the formation of \n\nmore secondary products than when using other organic solvents (i.e., toluene or \n\nxylene). This method also allows the scale-up of the reaction in order to obtain the \n\ndesired organic molecules in large amounts. The unique inconvenient resides in the \n\ndistillation, under reduced pressure, of triethyl phosphite (being this procedure \n\nperformed inside a hood fume using a quite complex system), and the need of high \n\ntemperatures to carry out the reaction; \n\nii) the Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction showed is a good choice for the reaction \n\nbetween an aryl halide and triethyl phosphite. Compared with the Michaelis-\n\nArbusov methodology, which does not need the use of any catalyst to isolate \n\nphosphohexaethyl ester intermediates, the reaction of aryl halide with trialkyl \n\nphosphite only occurs if we use a catalyst (in this case, the Pd-based catalyst \n\n[Pd(PPh3)4]). As for the previous described method, high temperatures are needed. \n\nDespite the high reaction temperature, it is not enough to isolate the desired \n\ncompound in high yields and for short periods of time. This fact was detected when \n\nthe reaction mixture was refluxed, containing the appropriate aryl halide, triethyl \n\nphosphite and [Pd(PPh3)4], using conventional heating processes. Therefore, \n\nperforming the Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction using the simpler and less \n\nenergy-consuming microwave-assisted approach, the desired phosphohexaethyl \n\nester intermediate was quickly (much faster than by using conventional heating) \n\nisolated in high yields. Despite the high temperature employed, the generated \n\npressure inside the reactor played an important role in the synthesis of the desired \n\ncompound. In addition, the scale-up of this reaction seems to be not very complex if \n\na bigger reactor (as for instance, with 35 mL of capacity) is used, and a restricted \n\ncontrol of the pressure generated inside the reactor to prevent accidents (i.e., \n\nexplosion). The inconvenient of this reaction follow the same line of the Michaelis-\n\nArbusov method: the distillation of triethyl phosphite, under reduced pressure, \n\ninside of a hood fume and the need of high temperatures to perform the reaction; \n\niii) Conventional acid hydrolysis proved to be a very efficient approach toward the \n\nhydrolysis of large amounts of phosphohexaethyl ester intermediate in order to \n\nproduce the desired acid phosphonic organic linkers. The use of this type of \n\nreaction is very simple since it is only needed to mix the phosphohexaethyl ester \n\ncompound with an aqueous solution of HCl. While an aqueous solution of HCl (6 \n\nM) is enough to hydrolyze all the phosphodiethyl ester groups of the intermediate \n\n\n\nBi- and Tripodal Phosphonate Organic Ligands \n\n                                                        87 \n\n \n\norganic molecules with only an aromatic ring, for the compound with four aromatic \n\nrings the use of concentrated HCl is fundamental. \n\nThe structures of all intermediate compounds (IL\n1\n, IL\n\n2\n, IL\n\n3\n and IL\n\n4\n) and the desired \n\norganic linkers (H4pmd, H6bmt, H6tftp and H6L) were unequivocally studied and \n\ncharacterized using standard liquid-state techniques (NMR spectroscopy and mass \n\nspectrometry). The crystal structure of the intermediate compounds IL\n2\n, IL\n\n3\n, IL\n\n4\n and the \n\nphosphonic acid H6tftp and H6L organic linkers were unveiled by using single-crystal X-\n\nray diffraction studies. The crystal structure of IL\n2\n, IL\n\n3\n and H6tftp were, for the best of our \n\nknowledge, firstly reported by our research group.\n44\n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n88                                                            \n\n \n\n2.8.

Initial Considerations \n\n \n\nThis chapter gives particular attention to the synthesis of several 1D and 3D MOFs \n\nusing the bipodal phosphonate-based organic linker 1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)-\n\ndiphosphonic acid (H4pmd).  \n\nThe structure of H4pmd (Scheme 2.4) contains an 1,4-dissubstituted aromatic ring \n\nwith two methylenephosphonic acid groups, with the ?CH2 moieties grant it some \n\nflexibility. This organic linker has been widely employed in the preparation of inorganic-\n\norganic hybrid materials. The studies have been focused in the self-assembly of structures, \n\ntypically under hydro(solvo)thermal conditions, which vary from 1D to 3D networks by \n\ncombining residues of H4pmd\n1-2 with, mainly, transition metals (Ni2+, Mn2+, Cd2+, Co2+, \n\nZn2+ and Cu2+)3-9 and p-block (Ga3+, Sn2+ and Pb2+)10-12. To the best of our knowledge, our \n\nresearch group reported the synthesis of the first multidimensional MOFs combining the \n\nbipodal organic molecule H4pmd with lanthanides: i) two isotypical 3D materials \n\n[Ce(Hpmd)(H2O)] and [Pr(Hpmd)(H2O)];\n13 recently, ii) five different Lanthanum-based \n\nMOFs, being one 1D ([La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12]) and four 3D ([La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2], \n\n[La(H3pmd)(H2pmd)(H2O)], [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)2] and [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)4]).\n14 \n\nIn this chapter it is described the preparation of several Lanthanide-Organic \n\nFrameworks from the self-assembly of H4pmd with lanthanides. On the one hand, a family \n\nof isotypical compounds, formulated as [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] [where Ln\n3+ = Eu3+ (1), Gd3+ \n\n(2) and Tb3+ (3)], was isolated by using three different approaches: i) conventional \n\nhydrothermal synthesis starting from the hydrolyzed ligand; ii) a rapid \u201cfive-second\u201d \n\nmethod based on microwave-assisted synthesis (MWAS); and iii) the ultrasonic method, a \n\nnovel heating approach in this field of research, allowing a drastic reduction of the required \n\ntemperature to ambient temperature, which, at the same time, clearly promoted the \n\nformation of nano-sized crystallites (average length between 100 and 200 nm from visual \n\ninspection of SEM pictures). On the other hand, five novel MOF structures were \n\ndiscovered by employing the MWAS approach and a bench procedure coined as one-pot \n\nmethod. Large crystals of [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4) and [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5), \n\nformulated on the basis of single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies, were directly isolated \n\nfrom the reaction vials via filtration from the reaction products of both MWAS and the \n\none-pot approaches. Small crystals of [La(H3pmd)(H2pmd)(H2O)] (6) were found as \n\nimpurities in some MWAS experiments. Samples from the one-pot reactions yielded \n\ncrystals of [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)2] (7) and powders of [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)4] (8). \n\nThe crystalline structure of all materials were unveiled by single-crystal or powder \n\nX-ray diffraction and characterized by using standard solid-state techniques \n\n(thermogravimetry, vibrational spectroscopy (FT-IR and FT-Raman), elemental analysis, \n\nsolid-state NMR and electron microscopy (SEM and EDS)). It is also discussed in detail \n\nthe methodologies and rationale used to obtain the different compounds while comparing \n\nthe structural features, purity, crystallinity, morphology and particle size of the obtaining \n\nmaterials. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n94                                                              \n \n\n3.2. From Micro- to Nano-Sized Lanthanide-Biphosphonate \n\nCoordination Polymers \n\n \n\n3.2.1. Synthesis \n\n3.2.1.1. Synthetic strategy \n\n \n\nThe hydro-ionothermal synthetic approach previously reported by our group led to \n\nthe direct isolation of [Ce(Hpmd)(H2O)] and [Pr(Hpmd)(H2O)] from the self-assembly of \n\nlanthanide centers with tetraethyl-p-xylylenebisphosphonate (texbp) in aqueous ionic \n\nmedium.13 For identical composition of the reactive mixtures we described in that report \n\nthat conventional hydrothermal synthesis failed to produce the desired compounds. More \n\nrecent (unpublished) laboratorial work further showed that the same strategy was i) poorly \n\nreproducible for other lanthanide centers, and that ii) even the use of microwave-assisted \n\nhydro-ionothermal synthesis did not promote the self-assembly of the primary building \n\nunits (PBUs).  Thus, experimental data strongly suggested that a crucial step for the self-\n\nassembly of the 3D MOF network resided in the ability of texbp to hydrolyze in solution \n\nthe phosphoryl groups: in our original report we focused that i) the addition of water was \n\nnecessary for the reaction and also that, in some cases, ii) the phosphonic acid molecule \n\ncould be directly isolated as a by-product (thus supporting the assumption of in situ \n\nhydrolysis). In order to expand the series of this material to the remaining lanthanide \n\ncenters we used instead the hydrolyzed molecule, 1,4-\n\nphenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid (H4pmd). Because the resulting \n\n[Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] [where Ln\n3+ = Eu3+ (1), Gd3+ (2) and Tb3+ (3)] materials were isolated \n\nusing less mild reaction conditions (180 \u00baC for 72 h), we employed different synthetic \n\nmethods (microwave- and ultrasound-assisted synthesis) to prepare the desired materials in \n\na simple and faster way, at mild conditions and as isolated nanoparticles. \n\n \n\n3.2.1.2. Conventional Hydrothermal Synthesis \n\n  \n\nHydro(solvo)thermal synthesis is the most used synthetic approach used to obtain \n\nMOFs as large single-crystals. Here, it is reported the synthesis of isotypical 3D MOFs, \n\nformulated as [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] [where Ln\n3+ = Eu3+ (1), Gd3+ (2) and Tb3+ (3)], sharing \n\nidentical crystal structures, isolated from the self-assembly between the bipodal H4pmd \n\norganic linker with the respective lanthanide(III) chloride hydrates, under typical \n\nhydrothermal conditions (180 \u00baC for 72 h; see sub-section 8.10.1.1 in the Experimental \n\nSection for further details). \n\nOpposite to expected, the resulting materials were isolated as microcrystalline \n\npowders. Therefore, and after several attempts, the isolation of [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] \n\nmaterials as single-crystals was not possible. Consequently, phase identification only could \n\nbe performed from full Rietveld refinement (see sub-section 8.10.1.1 in the Experimental \n\nSection for further detailed information on crystal and structure refinement). Figure 3.1 \n\n\n\n1D and 3D MOFs Based on 1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid \n\n                                                       95 \n \n\nshows the final Rietveld plot for compound 1 and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \n\nimages illustrating the morphologic features. A careful analysis of this set of data and \n\nsubsquent comparison with the previously reported [Ce(Hpmd)(H2O)] and \n\n[Pr(Hpmd)(H2O)] materials lead us to conclude that all compounds have the same crystal \n\nstructure.13 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 - Final Rietveld plot (laboratory powder X-ray diffraction data) of \n[Eu(Hpmd)(H2O)] (1). Observed data points are indicated as red circles, the best-fit \nprofile (upper trace) and the difference pattern (lower trace) are drawn as solid black \nand blue lines, respectively. Green vertical bars indicate the angular positions of the \nallowed Bragg reflections. Refinement details are given in Experimental Section. \nInset: SEM images of compound 1. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 depicts the powder X-ray diffraction patterns of compounds 2 and 3 and \n\ntheir respective SEM images. These compounds share identical crystal structures with 1, as \n\ndescribed above, and also have very similar crystal morphologies.  \n\nComparing with the hydro-ionothermal synthetic approach, we found that the \n\nconventional hydrothermal method employing the previously synthesized H4pmd molecule \n\nand the same reaction conditions (temperature of 180 \u00baC and 3 days of reaction), is \n\nsignificantly more reproducible and controllable. This leads to the desired materials as \n\nhighly microcrystalline phases with relatively uniform crystal size (Figure 3.2). \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n96                                                              \n \n\n3.2.1.3. Microwave-Assisted Hydrothermal Synthesis \n\n  \n\nIn order to prepare [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] materials in a simple and fast way, the \n\nMicrowave-Assisted Synthesis (MWAS) method was employed. This not so commom \n\napproach, when compared with the conventional hydrothermal approach, has been used for \n\nthe preparation of crystalline multidimensional MOFs. Our group has been adopting this \n\nsynthetic method because it promotes faster and more efficient preparations of functional \n\nhybrid materials.14-15 The possibility of preparating large amounts of [Eu(Hpmd)(H2O)] (1) \n\nand [Tb(Hpmd)(H2O)] (3) through the use of the microwave-assisted heating was \n\ninvestigated. \n\nTo find the best reaction conditions it was necessary to optimize the synthesis. \n\nFixing the power at 50 W, other reaction parameters were tested, such as: i) temperature \n\n(40, 50, 60, 70, 90, 120 and 150 \u00baC) and ii) reaction time (5 s, 10 s, 30 s, 1 min and 5 min) \n\n(see sub-section 8.10.1.2 in the Experimental Section for further synthetic details). It was \n\nfound, after analyzing the powder X-ray diffraction patterns, that the desired materials can \n\nbe readily isolated as phase-pure, in very good yields, at 40 \u00baC with just 5 seconds of \n\nreaction time. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 - Powder X-ray diffraction patterns and SEM images of the \n[Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] [where Ln\n\n3+ = Gd3+ (2) and Tb3+ (3)] materials. \n \n\n \n\n After a careful examination of the SEM images obtained for 1, it is very interesting \n\nto observe that this compound exhibits an almost homogeneous morphology and crystal \n\nsize distribution both in severe (150 \u00baC and 5 min of reaction) and in soft (60 \u00baC and 1 min \n\n\n\n1D and 3D MOFs Based on 1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid \n\n                                                       97 \n \n\nof reaction) reaction conditions (Figure 3.3). Aiming to investigate the possibility to further \n\ndecrease the crystal size of compound 3, we reduced both the temperature and the total \n\ntime of the microwave irradiation (Figure 3.4). By reducing this latter parameter a slight \n\nreduction of the average crystal size was observed (Figure 3.4 top and middle). Crystal size could \n\nbe further decreased by also reducing the temperature to 50 \u00baC (Figure 3.4 bottom). Noteworthy, \n\nand as mentioned above, compound 3 could also be isolated at 40 \u00baC but for this case the average \n\ncrystal size is relatively identical to that obtained at 50 \u00baC (data not shown). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 - SEM images of material [Eu(Hpmd)(H2O)] (1) prepared using \nmicrowave heating (power 50 W). \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n98                                                              \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 - SEM pictures of compound [Tb(Hpmd)(H2O)] (3) prepared using \nmicrowave heating at 60 and 50 \u00baC for total irradiation times of 60 and 5 seconds.  \nThe scale bar (corresponding to 500 nm) is identical to all pictures. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.1.4. [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] materials as isolated nanoparticles \n\n  \n\nIn the previous subsection it was described the formation of aggregates of \n\nnanoparticles of compound [Tb(Hpmd)(H2O)] (3) under microwave irradiation. Since the \n\npreparation of [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] [where Ln\n3+ = Eu3+ (1) and Tb3+ (3)] materials as isolated \n\n\n\n1D and 3D MOFs Based on 1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid \n\n                                                       99 \n \n\nnanoparticles was the goal, several attempts using different methodologies were \n\nperformed:  \n\n \n\ni) Reverse microemulsion under constant conventional or mechanical stirring: a \n\nsolution composed of Triton X-100, 1-octanol, cyclohexane, TEOS (tetraethyl \n\northosilicate), the organic ligand H4pmd and EuCl3\u00b76H2O was added to another \n\ncontaining Triton X-100, 1-octanol, cyclohexane and NH3. The resulting reaction \n\nmixture was stirred in a conventional stirring plate or in a mechanical stirring \n\nequipment at ambient temperature during different periods of time (from 1 to 2 \n\ndays). After reacting, acetone was added occurring the formation of a precipitate \n\nwhich was recovered by decantation and, then, by centrifugation. The precipitate \n\nwas washed with water, ethanol and water again. This methodology was based on a \n\npublished work with some modifications.16 In that work, the authors reported the \n\npreparation of lanthanide\u2013containing polyoxometalates (POMs) in isolated silica \n\nnanoparticles. Employing this procedure we were, unfortunately, unable to obtain \n\n[Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] [where Ln\n3+ = Eu3+ (1) and Tb3+ (3)] materials in isolated silica \n\nnanoparticles. Additionally, analyzing the resulting materials by powder X-ray \n\ndiffraction (PXRD) it was observed that the resulting precipitate has a PXRD \n\npattern with a completely different profile (being also poorly crystalline) than the \n\nPXRD patterns (data not shown) of compounds 1 and 3. \n\n \n\nii) Reverse microemulsion under ultrasonication: the experimental procedure to \n\nprepare the final reaction mixture was very similar to that described above. The \n\ndifferences reside in the replacement of the stirring methods by ultrasonication and \n\nthe use of shorter reaction times (5 min, 30 min, 1 h and 4h) and temperature \n\n(ambient, 60 and 70 \u00baC). The resulting precipitates presented different crystalline \n\nstructures than the desired materials and the encapsulation with silica did not occur. \n\n \n\nAfter all the previous attempts, and following some published reports it was \n\ndecided to employ the ultrasonic-assisted synthesis method without the use of surfactants \n\nand silica. Ultrasound irradiation arises as an alternative synthetic technique known to be \n\nused in the preparation of nanoparticles,17-19 MOFs20-23 and, in particular, nanoscale \n\nMOFs.24-27 \n\n As for the microwave-assisted approach, the optimization of some reaction \n\nparameters in order to prepare isolated nanoparticles of 1 and 3 was performed. Therefore, \n\noptimization was based on the variation of: i) temperature (ambient temperature, 60 and 70 \n\n\u00baC), ii) time of ultrasonic irradiation (1, 3, 5, 10, 20 and 30 minutes), and iii) \n\n(Ln3+:H4pmd:H2O) molar ratio (1:1:600, 1:1:1200, 1:1:1800, 1:1:3600 and 1:1:7200). After \n\noptimization, some important conclusions can be inferred from the collected data:  \n\ni) phase-pure 1 was only isolated when the reaction temperature was near the \n\nambient temperature. Higher temperatures lead to the formation of secondary \n\nphases (left column in Figure 3.5);  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n100                                                              \n \n\nii) below 3 minutes of ultrasonic irradiation the reaction product was \n\nsystematically poorly crystalline and probably contaminated with an \n\nunidentified phase. For longer irradiation times, 1 was isolated as a phase-pure \n\ncompound with particle morphology independent of the time (middle column \n\nin Figure 3.5);  \n\niii) while a Ln3+:H4pmd:H2O molar ratios of 1:1:600 (reaction condition used for \n\nconventional hydrothermal and microwave-assisted synthesis) and 1:1:1200 \n\nproduce distinct phase from the aimed material, higher diluted solutions yield \n\nalways the desired phase-pure materials (right column in Figure 3.5). \n\n  In short, it was found that the optimal conditions to prepare isolated nanoparticles \n\nof 1 and 3 are the following: 5 minutes of ultrasonic irradiation at ambient temperature \n\nwith a 1:1:7200 molar ratio (see sub-section 8.10.1.3 in the Experimental Section for \n\nfurther reaction details). Nano-sized crystallites prepared under ultrasonic irradiation have \n\nbeen subjected to a myriad of comparative characterization studies with microcrystalline \n\nbulk materials so to unequivocally prove the structural resemblance between the isolated \n\nmaterials (Figure 3.6). For example, the highly sensitive photoluminescence studies of \n\ncompound 1 showed that the Eu3+ cation shares the same local coordination environment in \n\nboth the isolated nano-crystals (prepared under ultrasonic irradiation) and in the bulk \n\nmicrocrystalline material. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5 \u2013 Optimization of the reaction parameters to prepare isolated nanoparticles \nof compound 1. \n\n\n\n1D and 3D MOFs Based on 1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid \n\n                                                       101 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.6 \u2013 Characterization of compound 1.

O(4) and O(5) belong to the same phosphonate group which O,O-chelates to the \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n102                                                              \n \n\nmetallic centre via a bite angle of 56.76(5)\u00ba (see Table A.1.1 in the appendices for further \n\ndetails), in good agreement with the value reported for the Ce3+ and Pr3+ analogues.  This \n\nseven-coordination environment can also be described as derived from a highly distorted \n\noctahedron, in which one of the apical positions is occupied by this chelating moiety \n\n[Eu(1)\u2013Cg,O(4)/O(5) of 2.274(1) \u00c5], having the cis and trans octahedral angles in the \n\nca. 73.00-99.83\u00ba and 156.82-174.00\u00ba ranges, respectively.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7 - Schematic representation of the distorted {EuO7} monocapped trigonal \nprismatic coordination polyhedra present in [Eu(Hpmd)(H2O)] (1).

Noteworthy, the registered \n\nintermetallic distances are smaller than those reported by us for the Ce3+ and Pr3+ analogue \n\ncompounds, agreeing well with the expected contraction of the lanthanide radii. Bridges \n\nbetween 1D arrays are ensured by strong O\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds (green dashed lines in \n\nFigure 3.8a) involving the hydrogenophosphonate and the coordinated water molecule (i.e., \n\ndonor groups): on the one hand, the coordinated water molecule is engaged in two \n\ninteractions with neighboring (hydrogeno)phosphonate moieties (O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O distances of about \n\n2.64 and 2.77 \u00c5); on the other, the same hydrogenophosphonate which accepts the \n\nhydrogen from the coordinated water donates its proton to the neighbouring phosphonate \n\ngroup (O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O distance of about 2.88 \u00c5).  Noteworthy, this arrangement of supramolecular \n\ninteractions promotes structural cohesion within the inorganic lanthanide \n\n(hydrogeno)phosphonate layer (Figure 3.8c).  Indeed, upon heating, it was not observed a \n\ndiscrete release of the coordinated water molecule without structural modification.  \n\n\n\n1D and 3D MOFs Based on 1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid \n\n                                                       103 \n \n\nInstead, the sudden release of water (at high temperatures) is concomitant with the collapse \n\nof the framework (see following section), thus providing additional evidence for structural \n\nimportance of these interactions. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8- (a) and (b) Schematic representation of the inorganic europium(III) \nphosphonate layer showing the hydrogen bonds (green dashed lines) connecting the \ncoordinated water molecule and the (hydrogeno)phosphonate moieties.

Thermogravimetry and Variable Temperature Powder X-ray \n\nDiffraction Studies \n  \n\n The thermal behavior of [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] materials has been investigated between \n\nambient temperature and ca. 800 \u00baC (see tabulated data in the Experimental Section for \n\nfurther details). Even though the decomposition pathway seems to have different kinetics \n\naccording to the lanthanide centre, overall the processes are relatively similar (see Figure \n\nA.1.1 in the appendices for further details).  For the particular case of 1, as clearly \n\nevidenced by the in situ variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction studies (Figure \n\n3.9a), the framework is thermally robust up to ca. 260 \u00baC with no visible modifications \n\n(peak presence or intensity) being noticeable in the diffractograms.  This was further \n\nconfirmed using vibrational spectroscopy (data not shown): the FT-IR spectrum of a \n\nportion of 3 placed inside an oven at 230 \u00baC for 3.5 hours is completely identical to that of \n\nthe as-prepared material. It is noted that up to ca. 260 \u00baC the weight loss is negligible \n\n(Figure 3.9b) and may be attributed, mainly, to the release of adsorbed water molecules. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n104                                                              \n \n\n At higher temperatures (above ca. 290 \u00baC) there is an abrupt weight loss up to \n\nca. 450 \u00baC, globally corresponding to ca. 6.5% in mass, which clearly exceeds the expected \n\nvalue for the complete release of the stoichiometric amount of coordinated water molecules \n\n(4.15%). It is, thus, feasible to assume that above 290 \u00baC there is, in a first stage, a \n\ncomplete release of these water molecules with the framework retaining its crystallinity (up \n\nto ca. 350-365 \u00baC); in a second stage, the extra weight loss may be attributed to the partial \n\ndehydration of the material from the protonated P\u2013OH groups, with this process ultimately \n\nleading to the concomitant collapse of the framework (as clearly shown in the variable-\n\ntemperature powder X-ray diffraction studies). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9 \u2013 Representation of the (a) variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction \npatterns and (b) the thermogram of [Eu(Hpmd)(H2O)] (1) material. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.4. Vibrational Spectroscopy Studies \n\n  \n\nThe vibration modes of the [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] materials reported in this chapter \n\nwere fully studied. A reliable assignment of the vibrational spectra of the compounds \n\nrequires the support from computational calculated data. In Figures A.1.2 and A.1.3 (in the \n\nAppendices) are represented the FT-IR and Raman spectra of compounds 1-3. \n\nExperimental and calculated data for compound 3 are given in Tables A.1.2 and A.1.3 in \n\nthe Appendices. \n\nThe FT-IR and Raman spectra of the four materials are very similar with the \n\nexception of a handful of bands. These differences are summarized in Table 3.1. The \n\ntypical lanthanide contraction along the series can explain the observed differences, which \n\nis accompanied by variations in bonding forces and lengths.

A number of modifications are \n\nclearly visible in the spectra (Figure 3.10).  Upon deuteration, some vibrations related to \n\nthe O\u2013H normal modes are absent. For example, ?(POH) is absent with the concomitant \n\nappearance of ?(POD) (Figure 3.10 and Table 3.2).  Other vibrations are also affected by \n\ndeuteration, because the O\u2013D is a small contributor; for example ?(POH) + ?(CH2) at 1220 \n\ncm-1 is shifted.  Noteworthy, this study allowed us to identify two important vibrations \n\nrelated to water below 1800 cm-1. In particular, the twisting mode vibration [?(H2O)] at \n\nabout 660 cm-1 arises from coordination to the metal centre. Below 600 cm-1 the spectrum \n\nwas widely affected by the deuteration. This is due to the appearance of new bands for the \n\n?(POD) and ?(D2O) vibrations, the change of unobserved bands of 1 corresponding to the \n\nvibrations of coordinated water, and to other combination vibrations which have a small \n\ncontribution of the O-D vibration modes. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3.2 - Main differences above 600 cm-1 in the FT-IR spectra of 1 and \n1D and their respective assignments (in cm\n\n-1). \n\nCalculated (for 1) 1  1D  \n\n3606 + 3791 3474 ?(H2O) 2574 ?(D2O) \n\n3438 3104 ?(POH) 2297 ?(POD) \n\n1605 1663 ?(H2O) 1212 or 1196 ?(D2O) \n\n1215 1220 ?(POH) + ?(CH2) 1212 or 1196 ?(POD) + ?(CH2) \n\n707 737 ?(POH) 553 or 535 ?(POD) \n\n648 645 ?(H2O) 468 or 444 ?(D2O) \n\n? \u2013 stretching; ? \u2013 in-plane deformation; ? \u2013 wagging; ? \u2013 out-of-plane \ndeformation; ? \u2013 twisting \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.5. Photoluminescence \n\n  \n\nThe presence of optically active metallic centers (i.e., Eu3+ and Tb3+) in the \n\nstructure of MOFs allows the conversion of UV radiation into visible light. In the next \n\nparagraphs, it is reported the photoluminescent properties of the [Eu(Hpmd)(H2O)] (1), as \n\nwell as its deuterated form [Eu(Hpmd)(D2O)] (1D), and the [Tb(Hpmd)(H2O)] (3) \n\nmaterials. \n\nFigure 3.11a displays the 300 K excitation spectra of compounds 1 and 1D, \n\nmonitored within the Eu3+ 5D0?\n7F2 transition. The broad UV band (ca. 240-340 nm) is \n\nattributed to the ?-?* transitions associated with the organic linkers, which is also present \n\nin the same wavelength range in the 11 K excitation spectrum of [Gd(Hpmd)(H2O)] (2) \n\n\n\n1D and 3D MOFs Based on 1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid \n\n                                                       107 \n \n\nmonitored at 445 nm (Figure 3.11b). The spectra are dominated by a series of sharp lines \n\nassigned to the 7F0,1?\n5D0-4, \n\n5L6, \n5G2-6, \n\n5H3-7 and \n5F1-5 Eu\n\n3+ intra-4f6 transitions. The 300 K \n\nexcitation spectrum of 3 (Figure 3.11b) is dominated by a similar intense broad band \n\ncentered at about 266 nm arising from the ???* electronic transition associated with the \n\norganic moiety, which matches satisfactorily with the excitation profile of 2 recorded at 11 \n\nK (Figure 3.11b). The intra-4f8 transition between the 7F6 ground state and the \n5D4?0 and \n\n5GJ excited states of Tb\n3+ are noticeable weaker. This demonstrates that the H4pmd is a \n\nmore suitable ligand to sensitize the Tb3+ cations than the Eu3+ ones via an energy transfer \n\nprocess, the so-called antenna effect. In this context, while Tb3+ is reasonable activated by \n\nthe indirect ligand excitation, a direct excitation is more effective for the Eu3+ emission. \n\nAs expected the emission spectra of compounds 1 and 1D at 300 K present a very \n\nsimilar profile (Figure 3.12a). They present, however, distinct emission features as \n\ndiscussed in more detail below. The emission spectra exhibit a series of narrow lines \n\nascribed to the Eu3+ 5D0?\n7F0-4 transitions; the \n\n5D0?\n7F5,6 transitions are not experimentally \n\ndetected. The 11 K emission spectra (Figure 3.12b for 1D) permit to unravel the local-field \n\nsplitting of the 7F1,2 levels into 4 and, at least, 7 Stark components, respectively. These \n\nobservations are apparently contradictory to the crystallographic studies which call for the \n\npresence of a single Ln3+ site (maximum of 3 and 5 Stark components for the 7F1,2 levels, \n\nrespectively).  \n\nThe detection of a single non-degenerated 5D0?\n7F0 transition and the identical \n\ntime-resolved emission spectra profile for very distinct initial delays and integration times, \n\nsuggest, however, that the low intensity supplementary emission lines should be attributed \n\nto vibronic emission. In fact, the energy difference relatively to the 5D0?\n7F0 transition \n\nmatch well with vibrations observed by FT-IR and FT-Raman studies, namely those at ca. \n\n428 and 1025 cm-1 most likely assigned to ?(PO3) and ?(PO3) vibronic modes (Tables \n\nA.1.2 and A.1.3 in the appendices). Because the phosphonate groups compose the second \n\ncoordination sphere of the Eu3+ ions, a vibronic coupling between both species can be \n\nexpected. Considering this, Eu3+ emission spectroscopy suggests the presence of a single \n\nEu3+ local site without inversion centre (higher intensity for the 5D0?\n7F2 transition). \n\nMoreover, the integrated intensity ratio between the 5D0?\n7F2 and \n\n5D0?\n7F1 transitions, \n\n)()( 1\n7\n\n0\n5\n\n2\n7\n\n0\n5\n\nFDFD\nII\n\n??\n, is for 1 ca. 3.29, which is significantly higher than the 0.68 value \n\nreported for a centrosymmetric Eu3+ emitting center.28 As described from the \n\ncrystallographic studies the seven-coordinated environment of Eu3+ resembles a highly \n\ndistorted {EuO7} monocapped trigonal prism.  Thus, the point group of Eu\n3+ is C1, which \n\nagrees well with the information derived from the Eu3+ emission spectroscopy. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n108                                                              \n \n\n250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600\n\n5\nD\n\n0\n\n7\nF\n0,1\n\n5\nD\n\n1\n\n7\nF\n0,1\n\n5\nD\n\n2\n\n7\nF\n0\n\n7\nF\n0,1\n\n5\nL\n6\n\n7\nF\n0\n\n5\nG\nJ\n\n7\nF\n0\n\n7\nF\n0\n\n5\nD\n\n4\n\n5\nD\n\n3\n\n5\nH\nJ\n\n7\nF\n0\n\n \n\nN\no\nrm\n\na\nli\ns\ne\nd\n I\nn\nte\nn\ns\nit\ny\n\nWavelength (nm)\n\n(a)\n\n \n\n240 280 320 360 400 440 480\n\n \n\nN\no\nrm\n\na\nli\ns\ne\nd\n I\nn\nte\nn\ns\nit\ny\n\nWavelength (nm)\n\n5\nD\n4\n\n7\nF\n6\n\n5\nG\nJ\n ,\n5\nD\n2\n, \n5\nD\n3\n\n7\nF\n6\n\n(b)\n\n \n\nFigure 3.11 - (a) Excitation spectra of [Eu(Hpmd)(H2O)] (1) (black line) and \n[Eu(Dpmd)(D2O)] (1D) (red line) acquired at 300 K, while monitoring the emission at \n609.4 nm.

This is further proof of the presence of a unique Eu\n3+ crystallographic \n\nsite and clearly demonstrates the improvement of the decay time (ca. 3.4 times) with the \n\nsubstitution of the coordinated water molecule by a deuterated one, leading to the \n\nsuppression of emission quenching through the coupling of the Eu3+ excited states with the \n\nvibrational states of the O\u2013H oscillators.

The huge increase observed \n\nin the 5D0 lifetime for the deuterated form is mainly due to the drastic decrease of the non-\n\nradiative transition rate, promoted by the suppression of the O\u2013H oscillators. Therefore, the \n5D0 quantum efficiency increases strongly from 16% to 54%. The absolute emission \n\nquantum yield measured at 392 nm (direct excitation of Eu3+) of 1D has a magnified \n\nincrease from 4% to 45%. These results demonstrate the strong quenching effect of the O\u2013\n\nH groups on the photoluminescence of 1. Also, the relative low absolute emission quantum \n\nyield value measured at 288 nm demonstrates the inefficient energy transfer pathway from \n\nthe ligand moieties to Eu3+. The 5D0 quantum efficiency (q) and the quantum yield (?) are \n\nrelated by:35-38 \n\n?=k q \n\nwhere the rate k accounts for all processes involved in the sensitization efficiency, defined \n\nas the efficacy with which energy is transferred from the feeding level (in this case \n\nessentially the intra-4f 5L6 level) onto the \n5D0 emitting state. In the present example k=0.83 \n\nfor 1D, which indicates that ca. 17% of the absorbed light at 392 nm (that essentially \n\ncorresponds to 5L6 absorption, Figure 9) is lost in non-radiative processes before reaching \n\nthe 5D0 emitting state. The estimation of the number of coordinated water molecules, ca. \n\n1.0, is in good agreement with the performed crystallographic studies. \n\nThe emission spectrum of 3 (Figure 3.14) acquired at ambient temperature \n\nmarkedly shows an intense green emission associated with the 5D4?\n7FJ transitions typical \n\nof Tb3+. The 5D4?\n7F5 transition centered at ca. 544 nm is the strongest corresponding to \n\nca. 57% of the integrated emission spectrum. The absence of transitions between the \n\nsecond excited state (5D3 level) indicates an efficient relaxation process from the \n5D3 to \n\n5D4 \n\nlevels, most likely due to resonant energy transfer between adjacent Tb3+ ions which are at \n\nan short intermetallic distance of ca. 3.99 \u00c5, favourable to the occurrence of this \n\nmechanism controlled by electric dipole interaction. As discussed above, the relative \n\nefficient energy transference from the antenna ligand to the emitting 5D4 Tb\n3+ excited level \n\nwas ultimately confirmed by measuring an absolute emission quantum yield of ca. 14%, \n\nwhich is significantly higher than the values obtained for 1 and 1D under similar excitation. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n112                                                              \n \n\n450 500 550 600 650 700\n\n7\nF\n2\n\n5\nD\n\n4\n\n5\nD\n\n4\n\n7\nF\n3\n\n7\nF\n4\n\n5\nD\n\n4\n\n5\nD\n\n4\n\n7\nF\n5\n\n7\nF\n6\n\n5\nD\n\n4\n\n \n\nIn\nte\nn\ns\nit\ny\n (\na\n. \nu\n)\n\nWavelength (nm)\n\n7\nF\n1\n\n5\nD\n\n4\n\n \n\nFigure 3.14 - Ambient temperature emission spectra of [Tb(Hpmd)(H2O)] (3) excited \nat 275 nm. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.6. Heterogeneous Catalysis \n\n \n\nThe catalytic performances of the microcrystalline bulk [Eu(Hpmd)(H2O)] (1) and \n\nthe nanocrystalline [Eu(Hpmd)(H2O)]nano (1n) materials were investigated in the ring-\n\nopening reaction of styrene oxide (PhEtO) with methanol, at 55 \u00baC (Scheme 3.1). The \n\nreaction of PhEtO in the presence of 1 was very sluggish giving 2-methoxy-2-\n\nphenylethanol (MeOPhEtOH) as the only product formed in 7% / 11% yield at 24 h / 48 h \n\nreaction. It is noted that similar results were observed without adding the catalyst, \n\nsuggesting that 1 does not exhibit significant catalytic activity (Table 3.4). After a 48 h-\n\nbatch run the solid material was recovered and characterized by PXRD and SEM. SEM \n\nimages of the recovered solid reveal some morphological changes: bundles (ca. 15 \u00b5m \n\nwide) of very fine needles turned into micro-sized aggregates of irregular morphology. \n\nPowder X-ray diffraction studies reveal, nevertheless, that the crystal structure of 1 \n\nremained unchanged under the used reaction conditions (Figure 3.15). \n\n \n\nScheme 3.1 - Reaction of styrene oxide with methanol, catalyzed for 1 or 1n, to \nproduce 2-methoxy-2-phenylethanol. \n\n\n\n1D and 3D MOFs Based on 1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid \n\n                                                       113 \n \n\nTable 3.4 - Ring opening of styrene oxide with methanol, at 55 \u00baC. a \n\nCatalyst \nReaction time \n\n(h) \n\nConversion of \nPhEtO (%) \n\nSelectivity to \nMeOPhEtOH (%) \n\nNone 4/24/48 2/10/15 100 \n\n1 4/24/48 2/7/10 100/100/100 \n\n1n 4/24/48 30/93/100 100/100/100 \n\nEuCl3\u00b76H2O 4/24/48 58/87/91 75/81/79 \n\nH4pmd 1 100 100 \n\na\n Reaction conditions: PhEtO (0.18 mmol), catalyst (7.5 mg 1, or 0.018 mmol of \n\nEuCl3\u00b76H2O or H4pmd, methanol (0.43 mL), 55 \u00baC. \n \n\n \n\nThe reaction of PhEtO with methanol in the presence of 1n gives MeOPhEtOH in \n\nquantitative yield within 48 h reaction, at 55 \u00baC (Table 3.4). These results are far superior \n\nto those observed for 1. Opposite to that, 1n exhibits excellent regioselectivity to the \n\nformation of the ?-alkoxy alcohol product. According to the literature, the alcoholysis of \n\nPhEtO may be favored by the presence of free coordination positions at Lewis acid sites \n\nfor the activation of the PhOEt molecules and the subsequent nucleophilic attack of \n\n(heteroatom-based nucleophile) methanol at the benzylic carbon atom of the epoxide \n\nring.39-40 The SEM images of the recovered solid 1n show that this material remained \n\nnanocrystalline (ca. 100 nm), forming aggregates of ca. 5-10 \u00b5m in diameter. Reducing the \n\ncrystallites size of 1 down to the nano-scale increases the surface area, which expectedly \n\nenhances the number of accessible active sites, explaining the enhanced catalytic activity \n\nof 1n in comparison to 1. It is also possible that the active sites correspond to structural \n\ndefects, in which case the reduction of crystallite sizes would expectedly enhance the \n\nnumber of external defect sites and consequently the catalytic activity. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n114                                                              \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.15 \u2013 Powder X-ray diffraction and SEM of the bulk [Eu(Hpmd)(H2O)] (1) \nand nano [Eu(Hpmd)(H2O)] (1n) materials before and after catalytic studies.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFor comparative purposes the precursors H4pmd organic linker and EuCl3\u00b76H2O \n\nwere tested as (homogeneous) catalysts in the methanolysis of PhEtO, under similar \n\nreaction conditions (using molar equivalent amounts to those of ligand and lanthanide, \n\nrespectively, in the loaded 1n catalyst). In the case of H4pmd, MeOPhEtOH is formed in \n\nquantitative yield within 1 h reaction, indicating that it is a quite active and selective \n\nBr\u00f8nsted acid organocatalyst (Table 3.4). Using EuCl3\u00b76H2O MeOPhEtOH is formed in \n\n79% selectivity at 91% conversion, reached at 48 h reaction, indicating that this precursor \n\nis less selective than that observed for 1n. Based on these results we may postulate that the \n\nactive sites in 1n may be of the type Br\u00f6nsted acid and/or coordinatively unsaturated Lewis \n\nacid sites, which would inherently correspond to structural defect sites. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n1D and 3D MOFs Based on 1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid \n\n                                                       115 \n \n\n3.3. Lanthanum-Biphosphonate Coordination Polymers Isolated \n\nby Microwave-Assisted and One-Pot Synthesis \n \n\n3.3.1. Synthesis \n\n3.3.1.1. Synthetic strategy  \n\n  \n\nMicrowave-Assisted Synthesis (MWAS) and one-pot method have distinct \n\nprinciples and a direct transposition of the experimental conditions from one method to \n\nanother is difficult. While MWAS permits the reduction of reaction time and the possibility \n\nto control the morphology of the materials,15,41 the one-pot method usually allows growing \n\nof crystals for single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies while maintaining small reaction \n\ntimes.42-43 A systematic variation of the experimental conditions is, thus, pertinent in order \n\nto obtain (i) phase-pure and (ii) highly crystalline materials while (iii) exhibiting uniform \n\ncrystal habit and size distribution. In order to quickly screen the achieved products in terms \n\nof purity and morphology, a combination of X-ray diffraction (powder and single-crystal) \n\nand Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used. Replication of the synthetic \n\nconditions was also performed to test the reproducibility of the present reactive system and \n\nthe results are summarized in the following sub-sections. \n\n \n\n3.3.1.2. Microwave-assisted synthesis \n\n  \n\nHydrothermal synthesis has been routinely employed as a daily synthetic approach of \n\nMOFs. In this context, phase-pure [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5) was first isolated under \n\ntypical hydrothermal conditions, using convection heating at 180 \u00baC during 72 h (see sub-\n\nsection 8.10.2.1 in the Experimental Section for further details). The crystals obtained \n\npresented a plate-like morphology having dozens of micrometers. \n\nConsidering that mild and faster conditions are usually preferred, we first transposed \n\nthe preparation of the aforementioned material to MWAS. The presence of three distinct \n\nphases, as identified by PXRD, was unequivocally confirmed while inspecting the \n\ninfluence of the reaction parameters on the purity and crystal habit (see Scheme 3.2). \n\nMicrowave heating was found to be an efficient method to prepare different phases by \n\nsolely changing the reaction temperature: [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4) is formed at low \n\ntemperatures (below 40 \u00baC); [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5) is mainly obtained at high \n\ntemperatures, typically above 90 \u00baC, in line with the results of the static hydrothermal \n\nconditions. For a mid-range temperature, mixtures of both compounds were always \n\nobserved alongside with the presence of a small amount of [La(H3pmd)(H2pmd)(H2O)] (6). \n\nUnreacted organic ligand may be found in all prepared materials (except for high \n\ntemperatures). Nevertheless, it does not represent an experimental hindrance because it is \n\neasily removed from the final product by washing with distilled water. We note that \n\ngrinding the reactant prior to the synthetic procedure can drastically reduce the presence of \n\nunreacted ligand. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n116                                                              \n \n\n \n\nScheme 3.2 \u2013 Optimization of the microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis of \n[La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4) and [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5).

The metal-to-ligand molar ratio used in all synthesis is of ca. 1:1. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe reaction time does not seem to have a significant influence in the preparation of \n\n5. The same does not happen for the employed irradiation power. A strict control of the \n\nreaction temperature is, thus, crucial. It is also noted that using this experimental setup, \n\npower input may have a great influence in the outcome because it is difficult to maintain \n\nstable low temperatures while using high irradiation power and vice-versa. \n\nBesides 4 and 5, the optimization stage also revealed the presence of minor \n\nquantities of compound 6 as impurity. Optimization of the experimental conditions to \n\nisolate phase-pure 6 proved unsuccessful. Nevertheless, from the obtained physical \n\nmixtures and taking into account the considerable differences in particle size and \n\nmorphology, it was possible to manually isolate a crystal representative of each phase. \n\nThese crystals allowed a full structural characterization using single-crystal X-ray \n\ndiffraction studies (see tabulated data in Experimental Section). \n\n \n\n\n\n1D and 3D MOFs Based on 1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid \n\n                                                       117 \n \n\n3.3.1.3. One-Pot Synthesis \n\n \n\nThe one-pot methodology is substantially different from MWAS: milder \n\ntemperatures are typically used alongside with no (autogenous) pressure. For each pair of \n\ntemperature/time, the metal-to-ligand molar ratios were varied at the proportions of ca. 1:1 \n\nand 1:2. A second 1:1 trial was performed but diluted to the double, hereafter defined as \n\n1:1*. As in MWAS, phase-pure products [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4) and \n\n[La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5) may be readily obtained under various reaction conditions. \n\nAdditionally, two new compounds were found, namely [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)2] (7) and \n\n[La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)4] (8). All the materials are crystalline and show particle size in \n\nthe micrometer range, as observed for the samples prepared by MWAS. \n\nIt is noted that this method has the drawback of introducing some randomness in \n\nthe prediction of the phases to be obtained (Scheme 3.3). In opposition to MWAS, where a \n\nclear evolution of a phase into the other with increasing temperature (the most significant \n\nreaction parameter) is observed, in the one-pot method the same logical behavior is not \n\npresent.  \n\nAs for MWAS, the reaction time does not seem to have a strong influence on the \n\nobtained compound and the most important parameter is, once again, the temperature. \n\nAbove ambient temperature the composition of the reactive mixtures is also a factor to be \n\nconsidered. In spite of a handful of exceptions at 40 \u00baC, some conclusions can be inferred: \n\ni) Compound 4 predominates at ambient temperature, whereas compound 5 is \n\nformed especially at high temperatures (Scheme 3.3); \n\nii) In general, compound 8 appears essentially in the 1:1* trials; at 80 \u00baC this \n\ncompound is even the major product; \n\niii)  Higher temperatures and ligand-to-metal molar ratios favor the appearance of \n\ncompound 7; \n\niv)  Compounds 7 and 8 can only be prepared (but not isolated as phase-pure) at high \n\ntemperatures (80 \u00baC). \n\nIn short, we can assume that 4 is the kinetic compound because it is formed at milder \n\nconditions. On the other hand, 5 seems to be the thermodynamic phase. A higher quantity \n\nof H4pmd favors the formation of 7 due to its 1:1.5 La:H2pmd stoichiometry, with this \n\ntendency being enhanced at higher temperatures. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n118                                                              \n \n\n \n\nScheme 3.3 \u2013 Optimization of the one-pot synthesis conditions for \n[La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4) and [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5).

The ratio is represented as metal-to-ligand molar ratio. Phase 4 is \npredominant at ambient temperature and 5 is formed preferentially at higher \ntemperatures. These two compounds can be isolated as phase-pure in a variety of \nexperimental conditions. Compounds 7 and 8 are mostly formed, as main products, at \nhigh temperatures (80 \u00baC) and could not be isolated as phase-pure. \n \n\n \n\n3.3.2. Crystal Morphology \n\n \n\nCrystal morphology varies according to the obtained phase for the two heating \n\nmethods. Crystals of [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4) exhibit needle-like morphology for all \n\ntested reaction conditions, with individual crystallites being stacked into large aggregates \n\nwith varying shape and size. This was also observed for compound \n\n[La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5), with the exception of the crystallite habit, which are in this \n\ncase plates.  \n\n\n\n1D and 3D MOFs Based on 1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid \n\n                                                       119 \n \n\nComparing the two methods, MWAS originates needles of 4 with lengths typically \n\nsmaller than those obtained by the one-pot methodology. On the other hand, the plate-like \n\ncrystallites of 5 have similar sizes for the two approaches. Concerning crystallite size, \n\nwhen MWAS is employed, the size of needles of 4 is generally smaller than the plate-like \n\ncrystallites of 5. In opposition, it is not possible to unequivocally determine the relation in \n\nsize of crystallites of the two compounds for the one-pot method. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.16 \u2013 Powder X-ray diffraction patterns and SEM images of bulk materials \nprepared using MWAS at different temperatures during 5 minutes of reaction: phase-\npure 4, as needle-like crystals, is isolated at low temperatures (30 and 40 \u00baC) while \nphase-pure 5, comprising plate-like crystals, at 150 \u00baC (please note: at 90 and 120 \u00baC \ncompound 5 is contaminated with small amounts of 6). Intermediate temperatures (50, \n60 and 70 \u00baC) promote the preparation of mixtures comprised of both phases 4 and 5.  \n\n \n\n \n\nBecause the temperature is of crucial importance to isolate phase-pure products it \n\nis, thus, pertinent to look into more detail to the variation of the average particle size and \n\nthickness when this parameter is changed. For MWAS, at lower temperatures (e.g., 30 and \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n120                                                              \n \n\n40 \u00baC) and irradiation power (10 W) phase-pure 4 is obtained (after removing the excess of \n\nthe organic linker) with particle size ranging from few to tens of micrometers. At 50, 60 \n\nand 70 \u00baC mixtures of 4 and 5 are isolated (for irradiation powers of 25 and 50 W). \n\nCrystals of phase-pure 5 begin to appear at 50 \u00baC becoming predominant above 70 \u00baC, as \n\nobserved from the combined PXRD and SEM studies given in Figure 3.16. In this case it is \n\nnot possible to conclude on a trend for the variation of the average crystal size. Only at 150 \n\n\u00baC a significant increase in the crystallite size is observed. However, the emergence of \n\n[La(H3pmd)(H2pmd)(H2O)] (6) in the reactions performed at 90 and 120 \u00baC may, \n\nsomehow, inhibit crystal growth. Hence only at 150 \u00baC there is no interference of \n\ncontaminant species (i.e., free organic ligand or compound 6) and, therefore, the increase \n\nin particle size is clearly noticeable. \n\nFor the materials obtained at 150 \u00baC, but using different microwave irradiation \n\nperiods, it seems that reaction time does not have a significant role in the final particle \n\nmorphology and size (Figure 3.17). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.17 \u2013 SEM images of phase-pure [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (4) prepared \nunder microwave irradiation at 150 \u00baC using different reaction periods. Despite the \nvariation of reaction time (from 1 to 10 min), significant variations in crystallite habit \nare not observable: particle size and plate-like morphology remain approximately \nidentical. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhen using the one-pot method and for a metal-to-ligand molar ratio of ca. 1:1, at \n\nmild temperatures in which compound 4 is predominant (ambient temperature and 40 \u00baC), \n\nthe increase of the reaction time decreases, in general, the length of the needles. \n\nFurthermore, the difference in size for these two temperatures is negligible. For higher \n\ntemperatures (60 and 80 \u00baC) plate-like crystallites of 5 are observed, and the reaction time \n\ndoes not affect the particle size. The raise in temperature increases aggregation of particles \n\n\n\n1D and 3D MOFs Based on 1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid \n\n                                                       121 \n \n\nand the distribution size for all sample ranges from few micrometers (ca. 2-3 \u00b5m) to \n\ndozens of micrometers (ca. 20-30 \u00b5m) (Figure 3.18).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.18 \u2013 SEM pictures of the materials obtained using the one-pot method when \na ca. 1:1 metal-to-ligand molar ratio is employed, depicting the variation of \ntemperature and reaction time.

Crystal Structure Description \n\n  \n\nIn this subsection will not be describe in detailed the crystal structure of each \n\nisolated material. Due to the variety of compounds herein obtained using two different \n\nsynthetic methods, the main objective is based on the comparison of those products \n\nconcerning their purity, crystallinity, morphology and particle size. Therefore, in this \n\nsubsection it is only discussed their general structural features. While compounds 4 to 7 \n\nwere characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, compound 8 was identified by ab \n\ninitio powder X-ray diffraction studies. For a detailed description on collection of data and \n\ncrystal structure resolution of 4-8 see sub-section 8.10.2.3 in the Experimental Section and \n\nthe published work reporting these data.14 \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n122                                                              \n \n\nAs mentioned above, the present crystallographic description has comparative \n\npurposes. Therefore, to have more insights about crystal data (i.e., selected bond lengths, \n\nangles and hydrogen bonding geometry) see Tables A.2.1- A.2.9 in the Appendices. \n\n Five different crystal structures, namely [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4), \n\n[La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5), [La(H3pmd)(H2pmd)(H2O)] (6), [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)2] (7) \n\nand [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)4] (8) [where H4pmd = 1,4-\n\nphenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid), were unveiled in the course of this work. As \n\nit is shown by the formulae, all compounds appear in three different La : H4-xpmd\n-x ratios: 1 \n\n: 1 for 5 and 8; 1 : 1.5 for 4 and 7; 1 : 2 for 6. Except for compounds 4 and 8, which have \n\nhigher contents of water molecules per metal center (6 and 2, respectively), compounds \n\ntypically have a sole water molecule per metal center.  \n\nThe coordination number of the La3+ metal centers also varies and is related to the \n\nkind and hapticity of the coordinated ligands. In 4 the coordination geometry around the \n\nnonacoordinated metal center resembles a tricapped trigonal prism formed by the \n\ncoordination to six water molecules and three crystallographic independent ?1-O-\n\nhydrogenophosphonato moieties (Figure 3.19). The coordination number of nine is only \n\npossible given the presence of a large number of small water ligands and a low number of \n\nbulk H4pmd residues. In compound 5, La\n3+ is octacoordinated to five phosphonic residues, \n\nbeing two of them O,O\u2019-chelating, and to one water molecule. If we consider the chelating \n\nphosphonates as single coordination sites, the geometry around the metal center can be \n\nseen as a highly distorted octahedron (Figure 3.20). The H4-xpmd\n-x residues appear in two \n\ndifferent protonation degrees and hapticities, being one of the type \u00b52-O,\u00b52-O\u2019,?\n1-O\u2019\u2019-\n\nphosphonate and the other of the type \u00b52-O,O\u2019-hydrogenophosphonate.  \n\nIn 6 and 7, the metal center is heptacoordinated to six non-chelating phosphonic \n\nresidues and to one water molecule. The large number of bulky ligands prevented \n\nchelation, reducing in this way the coordination number to a considerably low number for \n\nthe La3+ cation. Remarkably, while in 6 the metal center is almost rotosymmetric with the \n\ncoordination environment resembling a distorted pentagonal bipyramid, in 7 the metal \n\ncenter resembles a monocapped trigonal prism (Figures 3.21 and 3.22). The refinement of \n\nthe crystal structure of 6 did not permit a clear determination of the protonation sites. \n\nExcluding the assignment of protonation degree, it is possible to say there are two different \n\nhapticities for the phosphonate moiety residues, being one \u00b52-O,O\u2019 and another ?\n1-O. In 7 \n\nall the ligand moieties act as \u00b52-O,O\u2019-hydrogenophosphonates. In compound 8 the metal \n\ncenter is octacoordinated. As it happens with compounds 6 and 7, the metal center is, in 8, \n\ncoordinated to six organic residues, which, given their large volume, prevent chelation. \n\n However, the high number of organic ligands does not limit the number of water \n\nmolecules, and in this case the metal center is connected to two water molecules. The \n\ncoordination geometry around the metal center resembles a square antiprism (Figure 3.23). \n\nGiven that the model of the crystal structure of 8 was obtained by ab initio solution (Figure \n\n3.24) from powder X-ray data a clear determination of the proton sites was not possible. \n\nExcluding the location of the protons, the organic ligands appear as two centrosymmetric \n\n\n\n1D and 3D MOFs Based on 1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid \n\n                                                       123 \n \n\nphosphonic residues comprising a \u00b53-O,O\u2019,O\u2019\u2019-coordination of the two crystallographically \n\nindependent phosphonic residues. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.19 \u2013 (a) Schematic representation of the inorganic layer of \n[La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4) perpendicular to the c axis of the unit cell.

The remaining compounds are 3D structures. In spite of having different \n\nstoichiometries, coordination numbers and dimensionalities, the crystal packing of the five \n\ncompounds is based on the alternation of inorganic layers, containing the {LaOn} \n\npolyhedra, with organic layers comprising the organic linkers.  \n\nIn compounds 5-7 the lanthanide phosphonate layers are disposed perpendicular to \n\nthe c axis while in 8 it is along the a axis (Figures 3.26 and 3.27, respectively). Along the \n\ninorganic layer, the geometrical arrangement of {LaOn} polyhedra and their connection \n\nwith the phosphonate residues is different for the five structures.  \n\nIn 4 the 1D polymer shows two non-directly bonded metal centers at 6.2410(10) \u00c5 \n\nfrom each other, which are arranged in a slightly distorted close hexagonal packing [other \n\nLa\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7La distances range between 6.9514(11) and 7.6851(12) \u00c5] (Figures 3.19 and 3.26). \n\nOnly in 5 there is connection between the {LaO8} polyhedra forming a zigzag chain \n\nparallel to the a-axis of the unit cell, with the La\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7La intermetallic distances being of \n\n4.1819(12) and 4.5705(12) \u00c5 (Figures 3.20 and 3.26). While the \u00b52-O, \u00b52-O\u2019, ?\n1-O\u2019\u2019-\n\nphosphonate moiety is embedded in this chain, contributing for its stability, the \u00b52-O,O\u2019-\n\nhydrogenophosphanate moiety acts as interconnection between chains giving the 2D aspect \n\nto the inorganic layer.  \n\nIn 6, the isolated {LaO7} polyhedra are arranged in the inorganic layer in a \n\nrectangular grid with the La\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7La distances being 5.717(2) and 8.694(4) \u00c5. In this \n\ncompound the inorganic layers are disposed in an ABAB\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 fashion, where each vertex of \n\nthe grid is aligned with the center of the layer immediately above and below, instead of \n\nbeing completely aligned along the c-axis as it happens with the remaining four \n\ncompounds (Figures 3.21 and 3.26). In 7 the {LaO7} polyhedra are arranged in the \n\ninorganic layer in an elongated open hexagonal packing with the hole centered in the unit \n\ncell coordinates (\u00bd, 0, \u00bd). This is a hydrophilic hole toward which the coordinated water \n\nmolecules and the hydroxyl groups from H2pmd\n2- are directed. The distances between \n\nvertices of the hexagonal pattern (the metal centers) range from 4.756(8) to 6.237(10) \u00c5 \n\n(Figures 3.22 and 3.26).  \n\nIn 8 the {LaO8} polyhedra are arranged in a hexagonal fashion along the inorganic \n\nlayer with La\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7La distances ranging from ca. 5.46 to 6.34 \u00c5 (Figures 3.23 and 3.27). The \n\ntwo crystallographically independent phosphonate residues are distributed in alternate \n\nlayers along the a axis, i.e., between each three consecutive inorganic layers. The first pair \n\nis connected by the ligand containing atoms P1, and the other is connected by the ligand \n\ncontaining atom P2, or vice-versa. \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n1D and 3D MOFs Based on 1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid \n\n                                                       127 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.25 \u2013 Schematic representation of a portion of the 1D polymer present in \ncompound [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4), viewed in perspective along [100] direction of \nthe unit cell.

Thermogravimetric Studies of Phase-Pure Materials 4 and 5 \n\n \n\nThe thermal stability of the bulk (phase-pure) materials 4 and 5 were investigated \n\nbetween ambient temperature and ca. 800 \u00baC (Figure 3.28), providing additional structural \n\ninformation on their hydration level. As shown in Figure 3.28, the thermograms of the two \n\nmaterials are strikingly distinct reflecting the different chemical composition of the \n\ncompounds. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.28 \u2013 Thermograms of compounds [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4) and \n[La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5).  \nLegend: ???? \u2013 phase-pure 4; ???? \u2013 phase-pure 5. \n\n\n\n1D and 3D MOFs Based on 1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid \n\n                                                       129 \n \n\nFor 4, three main weight losses are observed. In the 45-130 \u00baC temperature range the \n\ncompound loses approximately 15.4% of the total weight, which agrees well with the \n\nrelease of eleven water molecules per formula unit. This weight loss is slightly smaller \n\nthan the calculated value of about 17.2% corresponding to the twelve water molecules \n\n(based on the crystallographic studies). However, and as observed for 5, these correspond \n\nto subsequent weight losses, increasing the difficulty to determine where each loss begins \n\nand finishes. In that sense, and looking to the slow decrease in weight above 130 \u00baC we \n\nbelieve that both values (observed and calculated) are in good agreement. The latter two \n\nweight losses, corresponding to a total of ca. 3.1% and ca. 19.4%, were observed in the \n\ntemperature ranges between 200-400 \u00baC and 490-800 \u00baC, respectively. It is, thus, feasible \n\nto assume that they may be attributed to the overlap of the release of the remaining water \n\nmolecules and, lately, to the full decomposition of the organic components and \n\nconcomitant collapse of the crystalline network.  \n\nFor 5, the framework is thermally robust up to ca. 230 \u00baC, after which a weight loss \n\ncorresponding to ca. 3.1% in mass is observed, mainly attributed to the release of \n\ncoordinated water molecules  (calculated value of ca. 4.3% for one molecule per La3+ \n\ncation). Therefore, it is possible to infer that not all water molecules are released at this \n\ntemperature, being most likely liberated gradually afterwards. At higher temperatures \n\n(above ca. 450 \u00baC) there are two subsequent weight losses, globally corresponding to ca. \n\n4.1% (in 450-640 \u00baC range) and ca. 18.5% (in 640-800 \u00baC range), respectively. It is \n\nfeasible to assume that the former weight loss may be attributed to partial dehydration of \n\nthe material from the protonated P\u2013OH groups, leading to the release of approximately one \n\nwater molecule per La3+ cation (calculated value of ca. 4.3%). The latter weight loss could \n\narise from the decomposition of the organic component of the framework.  \n\n \n\n3.3.5. FT-IR Spectroscopy \n\n \n\nFT-IR spectroscopy studies clearly support the structural features unveiled by the \n\nX-ray diffraction studies. Figure 3.29 depicts selected regions in the spectra of phase-pure \n\ncompounds 4 and 5. Relevant differences in some spectral regions are noticeable despite \n\ntheir overall identical profiles, with most of these diagnostic bands being assigned to \n\nvibrational modes of coordinated water molecules. Such differences provide important \n\ninformation concerning the different coordination modes of the H4-xpmd\nx- residues and the \n\nchemical environment of the water molecules in the compound. \n\nThe typical ?(O\u2013H) stretching vibrational modes of the coordinated water \n\nmolecules appear in the 3600-3200 cm-1 range. Although below 2500 cm-1 the spectra of \n\nthe two compounds share striking similarities, in the 3600-3200 cm-1 range, which \n\ncorresponds to the vibrations assigned to the coordinated water molecules, there are \n\nnotable differences: while for 4 a large number of bands are scattered in a vast interval \n\nbetween ca. 3600 and 2600 cm-1, for 5 two strong bands are located at 3470 and 3395 cm-1. \n\nThis observation is in a clear agreement with the donor\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7acceptor distances shown in \n\nTables A.2.2 and A.2.4 in the appendices: a wider interval of D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A distances was \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n130                                                              \n \n\nobserved for 4 (from ca. 2.71 to 3.30 \u00c5) than for 5 (from ca. 2.82 to 2.91 \u00c5). Large \n\ninternuclear D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A distances imply weaker hydrogen bonds that, ultimately, correspond to \n\nstronger O\u2013H vibrations that appear at higher wavenumbers. We note that the registered \n\nwavenumbers are also affected by the D\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A interaction angle, but in this case the \n\nvariation intervals reproduce the same general trend than that described for the distances. \n\nThus, the narrow and strong band located at 3588 cm-1 for 4 is attributed to a water \n\nmolecule with, at least, one proton involved in weak hydrogen bonding interactions. This \n\ncould be assigned either to O1W (with very short D\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A angles in a bifurcated hydrogen \n\nbond) or to O6W (which corresponds to the largest D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A distance). In both materials there \n\nis also a band characteristic of the coordinated water molecules at ca.1600 cm-1. Again, the \n\nrelationship between the observed intervals of internuclear D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A distances and the D\u2013\n\nH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A interaction angle with the variation wavenumbers is observed: the band(s) for 4 is \n\n(are) considerably larger, clearly corresponding to at least two distinct environments for \n\nwater, in agreement with the structural information described above. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.29 \u2013 FT-IR spectra of compounds [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4) and \n[La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5).  \nLegend: ???? \u2013 phase-pure 4; ???? \u2013 phase-pure 5. \n\n \n\n \n\n  The PO\u2013H stretching modes were observed at ca. 2300 cm-1 as medium intensity \n\nbands.

The two peaks at ca. 1400 cm-1 \n\nwith medium intensity are attributed to the \u2013CH2\u2013 deformation modes from the P\u2013CH2\u2013 \n\ngroups.

For compound 4, the less \n\ndeshielded peak is, nevertheless, composed of two resonances peaking at ca. 16.1 and 15.1 \n\nppm while that at 24.2 ppm is well resolved. Peak deconvolution and integration including \n\nthe spinning sidebands yields a ratio of ca. 2.00 : 0.52 : 0.52 for these resonances, which \n\nadd up to a total of 3 sites for compound 4. The splitting of one resonance may be \n\nattributed to some structural disorder associated with the phosphonate groups, ultimately \n\nleading to slightly distinct chemical environments. Nevertheless, for 4, the 13C{1H} CP \n\nMAS spectrum (Figure A.2.2 in the Appendices) clearly shows two distinct spectral \n\nregions: the 20-50 ppm spectral range (peaks at 34.1 and 35.4 ppm) is attributed to the \u2013\n\nCH2\u2013 groups; the aromatic carbon atoms from the ring appear instead in the 120-140 ppm \n\nwindow (peaks at 129.6, 131.3, 131.9 and 133.6 ppm). In addition, the 1H MAS spectrum \n\n(Figure A.2.1 in the Appendices) is clearly dominated by an intense and narrow resonance \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n132                                                              \n \n\nat ca. 4.61 ppm attributed to water molecules that are highly mobile in the crystal structure \n\nof 4. It is also possible to discern in the 1H MAS spectrum the signal arising from the \u2013\n\nCH2\u2013 groups (at ca. 1.25 ppm) and a broad band containing both the aromatic protons and \n\nthose associated with the protonated phosphonate moieties. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.31 \u2013 \n31P HPDEC MAS spectrum of [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5).

A small \nimpurity present in 5 is identified by a diamond symbol (?). \n\n \n\n \n\nCompound 5 is considerably more crystalline and this fact is also noticeable in the \n\ncorresponding solid-state NMR spectra. Indeed, the 1H MAS spectrum (Figure A.2.3 in the \n\nAppendices) is much more resolved than that of compound 4, being possible to see the \n\nresonances arising from the \u2013CH2\u2013 groups (at ca. 1.05 ppm), the water molecules (at ca. \n\n3.27 ppm), the aromatic ring (broad band peaking at ca. 6.42 ppm) and those of the \n\nconsiderably deshielded \u2013POH moieties (at ca. 11.1 ppm). As in 4, peak deconvolution and \n\nintegration including the spinning sidebands in the 31P MAS spectrum (Figure 3.31) yields \n\na ratio of ca. 1.00 : 1.12 for the resonances peaking at ca. 26.2 and 10.0 ppm, agreeing well \n\nwith the expected two sites with equal occupancy present in the crystalline structure. The \n13C{1H} CP MAS spectrum (Figure A.2.4 in the Appendices) is concordant with that of \n\ncompound 4, exhibiting two clear spectral regions found at ca. 25-50 (for the methylene \n\ngroups) and 120-140 ppm (for the aromatic carbon atoms).

The crystalline structures of all materials were carefully investigated and fully \n\ncharacterized by using several solid-state techniques (X-ray diffraction (single-crystal or \n\npowder), vibrational spectroscopy (FT-IR and FT-Raman), electron microscopy (SEM and \n\nEDS), solid-state NMR, thermogravimetric and elemental analysis). \n\nCompounds 1-3 were prepared under conventional hydrothermal conditions, \n\nhowever, and opposite to expected, this methodology did not afford the desired materials \n\nas large single-crystals. Therefore, 1-3 were isolated as microcrystalline powders and their \n\ncrystalline structures were unveiled by powder X-ray diffraction. These materials share \n\nsimilar architecture to the previously reported [Ce(Hpmd)(H2O)] and [Pr(Hpmd)(H2O)].\n13 \n\nHydrothermal synthesis, using the hydrolyzed H4pmd, showed to be a more efficient and \n\nreproducible approach than the hydro-ionothermal synthesis which involved the \n\ncombination of lanthanide centers with the phosphoryl ester organic ligand tetraethyl-p-\n\nxylylenebisphosphonate in aqueous ionic medium. Nevertheless, conventional \n\nhydrothermal synthesis required the employment of high temperatures (180 \u00baC) and large \n\nperiods of times (72 h). These reaction conditions are not attractive for industry mainly if it \n\nis intended to scale-up the materials. Having this in mind, the preparation of 1-3 was \n\ncarried out by using a simpler and faster synthetic approach (MWAS). Remakably, \n\ncompounds 1-3 can be isolated at 40 \u00baC with just 5 seconds of reaction. It was also \n\ndemonstrated that by varying the heating procedure and other synthetic parameters it is \n\npossible to control crystallite size: while the conventional hydrothermal approach produces \n\ntypically micro-sized crystals, MWAS or ultrasounds-assisted synthesis (USAS), a recent \n\nsynthetic approach in the MOFs field, can isolate 1-3 as nano-sized materials. USAS \n\nfurther permits the preparation of the nano-crystals in an isolated fashion. \n\nCompounds 1-3 were investigated regarding their vibration modes. The preparation \n\nof the deuterated compound 1D allowed to elucidate the elusive vibrational modes of \n\nconfined (and coordinated) water molecules. Indeed, the combined \n\nexperimental/theoretical study identified most of the bands in the spectra including, for \n\nexample, the rarely-reported twisting vibration of water at about 665 cm-1. \n\nVariable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetry studies \n\nshowed that the materials are thermally robust up to ca. 290 \u00baC: the release of the \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n134                                                              \n \n\ncoordinated water molecule above this temperature is immediately followed by a collapse \n\nof the framework. Materials can, in this way, be employed in a robust fashion below this \n\ntemperature without compromising structural integrity and crystallinity. For example, the \n\ncatalytic activity of compound 1 was tested in the methanolysis of styrene oxide, under \n\nsolvent-free conditions at 55 \u00baC. It was discovered that the crystallite size of 1 plays a \n\ndeterminant role in this catalytic system: while microcrystalline 1 does not possess \n\nsignificant catalytic activity, the nano-sized counterpart 1n exhibits relatively high \n\ncatalytic activity and excellent selectivity to 2-methoxy-2-phenylethanol (100% yield \n\nwithin 48 h reaction). Reduction of the crystallite size promotes an increase of the total \n\nsurface area, which expectedly enhances the number of accessible active sites of 1n. \n\nStudies using the primary building blocks of 1 (i.e., ligand and metal source) permitted to \n\nconclude that these active sites of 1n should be of the Br\u00f6nsted acid type and/or \n\ncoordinatively unsaturated Lewis acid sites, which would inherently correspond to \n\nstructural defect sites. \n\nThe photoluminescent properties of compounds 1 and 3 have been further \n\ninvestigated. Photoluminescent studies showed that the organic ligand is a suitable \n\nsensitizer of Tb3+ (absolute quantum yield as ca. 14%) via the energy transfer process \n\ncalled antenna effect, leading to the isolation of an intense green-emitting material. We \n\nhave further shown that the coordinated water molecule to Eu3+ quenches significantly the \n\nphotoluminescence of 1: while at 300 and 11 K this compound exhibits lifetimes of \n\n0.58\u00b10.01 and 0.66\u00b10.01 ms, respectively, these value are boosted for its deuterated form \n\n(1D) to 1.98\u00b10.01 and 2.24\u00b10.01 ms, respectively. \n\nCompounds [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4) and [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5), a 1D and \n\na 3D structures, respectively, were successfully isolated as phase-pure compounds using \n\nboth synthetic approaches MWAS and a bench procedure coined as one-pot method and \n\ntheir crystalline structures were solved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Crystals of \n\n[La(H3pmd)(H2pmd)(H2O)] (6) and [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)2] (7) (obtained using microwave \n\nirradiation and from the one-pot approach, respectively) were manually harvested from \n\nphysical mixtures, ultimately allowing their full structural elucidation using also single-\n\ncrystal X-ray diffraction studies. Compound [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)4] (8), also obtained \n\nin one-pot approach, could only be isolated as a microcrystalline powder and its crystal \n\nstructure was determined instead by powder X-ray diffraction studies. \n\nIt was found that mild synthetic conditions are the optimal conditions for both \n\nsynthetic methods so to promote the formation of the low dimensional compound 4, \n\nwhereas the use of a higher temperature favored the formation of the 3D network 5. In that \n\nsense, we may look to 4 as the kinetic compound while 5 seems to be the thermodynamic \n\none. Investigations on the modification of the particle size and shape promoted by variation \n\nof the reaction temperature and time, revealed that 4 crystallizes preferentially as \n\naggregates of needle-like crystals while 5 crystallizes as plate-like particles. Furthermore, \n\nwe concluded that there is no direct relationship between the variations of those parameters \n\nand the final average particle size.  \n\n\n\n1D and 3D MOFs Based on 1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid \n\n                                                       135 \n \n\nCompound 6 could only be isolated as a residual product in MWAS and, despite all \n\nthe efforts, it was not possible to successfully isolate it as a phase-pure material. Likewise, \n\nthe appearance of 7 and 8 (synthesized using the one-pot approach) was promoted by the \n\nuse of high values of temperature (typically above 80 \u00baC). Compound 7 was favoured by \n\nthe use of higher ligand-to-metal proportion and its formation at higher temperatures could \n\nbe related with its 1:1.5 La:H4pmd stoichiometry in the reactive gel.  \n\n MWAS, as mentioned above, and the one-pot methodologies have considerable \n\nadvantages over typical solvo(hydro)thermal synthesis. In terms of reaction time, and as an \n\nattempt to solve the typical problem of using long reaction periods in the latter case, we \n\nwere able to drastically decrease the typical 3 days initially used to prepare compound 5 to \n\njust a single minute of reaction under microwave irradiation or, alternatively, to 10 minutes \n\nusing the one-pot methodology. Noteworthy, this drastic reduction in the reaction time has \n\na direct and huge influence in the total energy consumed to prepare the MOF compound. \n\nFor instance, considering the above reaction periods and power input/output values \n\nassociated with each of the three synthetic methods, we were able to estimate the energy \n\nconsumption, which ranged from ca. 340 000 kJ (3 days of hydrothermal conditions), to \n\nca. 18.0 kJ (for 1 min in MWAS) and to ca. 8.6 kJ (for 10 min in one-pot). Therefore, \n\nthese two alternative synthetic approaches to the typical hydrothermal reaction allow, on \n\none hand, to prove the phase diagram of one given system for other architectures and, on \n\nthe other hand, may also be considered for a possible implementation of the synthesis of \n\nMOFs at an industrial scale as they are cost efficient. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n136                                                              \n \n\n3.5.

Initial Considerations \n\n \n\nThis Chapter describes three families of MOFs with different dimensionalities \n\n(i.e., 1D, 2D and 3D) prepared from the self-assembly between a tripodal phosphonate-\n\nbased organic ligand and lanthanide metallic centers. The preparation of these materials \n\nwas achieved by using both conventional hydrothermal synthesis and microwave-\n\nassisted synthesis (MWAS). \n\n(Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic acid (H6bmt, Scheme 2.5) \n\nalso has some degree of more felxibility due to the presence of three pendant \u2013CH2\u2013 \n\nmoieties. Structural rigidity arises from the presence of the central benzene ring. \n\nCompared with the previously described H4pmd organic ligand, H6bmt has one more \n\nphosphonic acid group which provides it more coordinative sites and the possibility to \n\nisolate different multidimentional structures. The crystal structure of H6bmt was \n\nreported for the first time by Jaffr\u00e8s and collaborators.1 Since then this organic molecule \n\nhave been scarcely employed in either the synthesis of coordination-based complexes or \n\nin traditional crystal engineering approaches: i) in 2010 the group of Clearfield reported \n\nthe preparation of a dimeric complex of Cu2+, formulated as [Cu2(H4bmt)2(4,4\u2019-\n\nbpy)(H2O)2], using H6bmt and 4,4\u2019-bipyridine (4,4\u2019-bpy) under solvothermal \n\nconditions;2 ii) one year later Yang et al. prepared the 3D open-framework \n\n[Cu3(bmt)(H2O)3.6]\u00b7H2O from a reactive mixture composed of H6bmt and CuCl2\u00b72H2O \n\nin water;3 iii) more recently, Tang and collaborators reported eight new transition metal \n\ntrisphosphonate complexes, one 2D layered structure, formulated as \n\n[Cu2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2][H2dpe][H2O]4, produced by using H6bmt and seven from the self-\n\nassembly of its analogue (2,4,6-trimetylbenzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic acid \n\norganic molecule.4 To the present data H6bmt was used with lanthanide cations only by \n\nthe MOF research group working at the University of Aveiro.5-6 \n\nIt is described the preparation of three distinct families of multidimensional \n\nMOFs produced from the self-assembly of the tripodal H6bmt with non-radioactive \n\nlanthanide cations (all with the exception of Lu3+): \n\ni) 1D [Ln(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O materials [where Ln\n3+ = La3+ (9), \n\n(La0.97Eu0.03)\n3+ (10) and (La0.97Tb0.03)\n\n3+ (11)] isolated by hydrothermal MWAS;5 \n\nii) 2D layered [Ln2(H3bmt)2]\u00b7H2O materials [where Ln\n3+ = Eu3+ (12), Gd3+ (13), \n\nTb3+ (14), Dy3+ (15), Ho3+ (16), Er3+ (17), Tm3+ (18) and Yb3+ (19)] prepared \n\nunder conventional hydrothermal conditions; \n\niii) 3D [Ln2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O materials [where Ln\n3+ = La3+ (20), Ce3+ (21), Pr3+ \n\n(22), Nd3+ (23), (La0.95Eu0.05)\n3+ (24) and (La0.95Tb0.05)\n\n3+ (25)] isolated under \n\nhydrothermal conditions and also by employing the MWAS approach.6 \n\nThe crystal structures of the isotypical families of the 1D and 3D compounds \n\nwere unveiled by single-crystal X-ray, while the 2D materials, isolated as \n\nmicrocrystalline powders, were investigated using powder X-ray diffraction studies. All \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n142 \n \n\nmaterials were fully characterized by standard solid-state techniques (FT-IR, electron \n\nmicroscopy (SEM and EDS), solid-state NMR, thermogravimetric and elemental \n\nanalysis). \n\nThe catalytic behavior of the 9 and 20 was evaluated in the ring-opening reaction \n\nof styrene oxide with methanol. Both compounds showed excellent regioselectivity, \n\nrecyclability and structural stability in consecutive catalytic runs. Nevertheless, the \n\ncatalytic activity of 9 (conversion of 100% of styrene oxide in 30 min) is notably \n\noutstanding compared with that of compound 20 (conversion of 80% of styrene oxide in \n\n24 h). \n\nThe photoluminescent properties of the 1D materials 10 and 11, and of the 3D \n\nmaterials 24 and 25 is described in detail. The Tb3+-based compounds 11 and 25 \n\nshowed to be highly efficient light converting materials exhibiting absolute emission \n\nquantum yields of 44 and 46%, respectively. Removing under vacuum all the water \n\nmolecules (coordinated and of crystallization) from the crystalline structure of 24 \n\npromotes a remarkable increase of the quantum efficiency from ca. 15 to 54%.  \n\n \n \n\n4.2. Microwave-Assisted Synthesis of 1D Lanthanide-Organic         \n\nFrameworks \n\n  \n\n4.2.1. Microwave-Assisted Hydrothermal Synthesis \n\n \n\nTwo different lanthanum-based materials, formulated as \n\n[La(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O (9) and [La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (20), have been \n\nisolated while reacting the tripodal organic ligand H6bmt with lanthanum chloride \n\nunder microwave irradiation (see sub-section 8.11.1.1 in the Experimental Section for \n\nfurther details). Compound 20 was firstly prepared under conventional hydrothermal \n\nconditions and further details are described in Section 4.4.  \n\nAiming at the preparation of new phase-pure materials (in this case 9 and 20), \n\nthe reaction time and temperature in MWAS conditions were systematically varied \n\n(Figure 4.1). The 1D compound 9 is readily isolated at low temperatures, mainly at 40 \n\nand 60 \u00baC. Increasing both the reaction time and temperature, compound 20 starts to \n\nprevail as the main product. The latter material is, however, obtained as phase-pure only \n\nat 150 \u00baC. Mixtures of both compounds are isolated at 90, 100, and 120 \u00baC, with 20 \n\ndominating at higher reaction times (15 and 20 minutes). \n\nCrystal morphology of 9 and 20 was investigated using scanning electron \n\nmicroscopy (SEM): while 9 is composed of aggregates of particles with poorly defined \n\nmorphology, 20 is instead composed of spherical aggregates with sizes in the range of \n\ntens of micrometers (Figure 4.2). The reaction temperature seems to have an important \n\nrole in the crystal morphology and size of compound 9: at 40 \u00baC this compound is \n\nmostly composed of aggregates of small and irregular particles; increasing the \n\n\n\n1D-3D MOFs Based on (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic Acid \n\n143 \n \n\ntemperature for 60 and 90 \u00baC crystal growth is boosted, affording better-defined \n\nparticles. Crystals of 20 begin to appear at 100 \u00baC (for periods of time of 5 minutes), \n\nbecoming predominant at 120 \u00baC. In the 100-150 \u00baC temperature range changes in the \n\ncrystal size and morphology of 20 are not easily discerned. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 - Microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis optimization of the \nreaction temperature and time to obtain [La(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O (9) (light \nblue) and [La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (20) (light orange) materials. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 - PXRD patterns and SEM images of [La(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O \n(9) (light blue) and [La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (20) (light orange) prepared under \nmicrowave irradiation at different temperatures for 5 minutes of reaction time.  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n144 \n \n\n The preparation of optically-active materials with stoichiometric amounts of \n\ndistinct lanthanides was performed using the optimal conditions discovered for 9 while \n\nincluding 3% of Eu3+ or Tb3+ in the reactive mixtures: [(La0.97Eu0.03)(H4bmt)(H5bmt)-\n\n(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O (10) and [(La0.97Tb0.03)(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O (11) were obtained \n\nat 60 \u00baC using 5 minutes of irradiation.

Crystal Structure of [La(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O \n\n \n\nThe crystal structure of 9 was unequivocally determined from single-crystal X-\n\nray diffraction studies at 100 K in the monoclinic centrosymmetric space group P21/m, \n\nwith the asymmetric unit comprising a whole residue of H6bmt, half of a La\n3+ metal \n\ncentre, and five halves of crystallographically independent water molecules. The \n\nstructure is made up by a single La3+ ion located on the crystallographic mirror plane, \n\nbeing coordinated to four symmetry-related organic ligands and two water molecules \n\n(which are also located on the mirror plane). The overall coordination environment, \n\n{LaO8}, resembles a slightly distorted square antiprism (Figure 4.3). The La\u2013O \n\ndistances are 2.665(5) and 2.713(5) \u00c5 for the coordinated water molecules and range \n\nbetween 2.406(3) to 2.488(3) \u00c5 for the connections to the four symmetry-equivalent \n\norganic ligands composing the coordination sphere. The quadrangular and triangular \n\nfaces of the square antiprism show angles in the 77.80(15)-101.62(13)\u00ba and 42.04(7)-\n\n74.96(10)\u00ba ranges, respectively. The phosphonic acid residues are all located on the \n\nsame side of the medium plane defined by the carbon atoms of the organic ligand \n\n[largest deviation of 0.064(4) \u00c5 for C5]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 - Distorted {LaO8} square antiprismatic coordination environment of \nthe crystallographically independent La3+ cation present in \n[La(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2] (9).

Thermogravimetry and Thermodiffractometry \n\n \n\nThe thermal stability of bulk [Ln(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O materials [where \n\nLn3+ = La3+ (9), (La0.97Eu0.03)\n3+ (10) and (La0.97Tb0.03)\n\n3+ (11)] was investigated between \n\nambient temperature and ca. 800 \u00baC. Thermograms show a relatively similar thermal \n\nstability for all compounds (Figure B.1.2 in the Appendices). In order to evaluate the \n\neffect of increasing temperature in the crystal structure VTPXRD studies have been \n\nperformed for 9 in the 30-500 \u00baC range (Figure 4.6 \u2013 top right). In the following \n\nparagraphs we shall focus the discussion on the thermal behavior of compound 9, being \n\nassumed that this behavior is similar for the remaining members of the isotypical series. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n148 \n \n\nBetween ambient temperature and ca. 184 \u00baC, two consecutive weight losses are \n\nmarkedly visible (Figure 4.6 \u2013 bottom left): three water molecules are released in the \n\nfirst step (ca. 5.9% weight loss; calculated ca. 5.7%), while the second step agrees well \n\nwith the liberation of two of such moieties (ca. 3.5% weight loss; calculated ca. 3.8%). \n\nThese results are in perfect agreement with the crystallographic studies which \n\ndetermined for the empirical formula of 9 the presence of three disordered water \n\nmolecules housed within the small crystal channels, and two additional ones \n\ncoordinated to the rare-earth cations. Moreover, the two markedly distinct environments \n\nfor these moieties fully justify the temperature ranges in which they are released. \n\nThermodiffractometry studies show that the structure of compound 9 remains \n\nunaltered up to ca. 60 \u00baC (Figure 4.6 \u2013 top right). Between this temperature and ca. 120 \n\n\u00baC a new crystalline phase is obtained, most likely corresponding to the phase without \n\nthe disordered lattice water molecules of crystallization (see above). The liberation of \n\nthe coordinated water molecules induces a new sudden structural modification which \n\nprevails in the ca. 120-200 \u00baC temperature range. \n\nA third weight loss, corresponding to a total of ca. 5.1%, occurs between ca. 230 \n\nand 350 \u00baC. According to our previous studies on lanthanide polyphosphonates,8 at this \n\ntemperature range the organic ligand may begin to deteriorate leading to the formation \n\nof pyrophosphonates with the consequent release of water molecules (in this case the \n\nobserved weight loss is equivalent to almost three water molecules). To prove this \n\nhypothesis, compound 9 was calcined at 350 \u00baC and the resulting residue was analyzed \n\nby FT-IR so to identify the typical ?(P?O?P) stretching vibration of pyrophosphonates, \n\nwhich normally appears in the 930-915 cm-1 range.9 The results were inconclusive due \n\nto the existence of other vibrational modes in this spectral region overlapping of the \n\n?(P?O?P) vibration. We note, however, that thermodiffractometry reveal two more \n\nphase transformations in the ca. 230-350 \u00baC temperature range, both leading to \n\ncrystalline phases. \n\nAfter the formation of an amorphous residue at ca. 450 \u00baC, there is a markedly \n\nvisible weight increase of ca. 1.5 % at around ca. 500 \u00baC, which can be attributed to an \n\noxidation of the organic component, in particular the oxidation of the phosphonate P?C \n\nbond to a P?O moiety. This assumption is further supported by a direct comparison \n\nbetween the thermograms of compound 9 performed under air and nitrogen atmospheres \n\n(Figure B.1.3 in the Appendices): when using N2 there is no weight increase at ca. 500 \n\n\u00baC. It is important to emphasize that up to this temperature (ca. 500 \u00baC) the thermal \n\nbehaviour in air and nitrogen of compound 9 is almost identical, ultimately indicating \n\nthat the thermal stability of the material, alongside with its phase transformations due to \n\nthe release of water molecules and most likely the formation of the pyrophosphonates, \n\nis independent of the atmosphere. The presence (or absence) of an oxidative atmosphere \n\nonly starts to be important when the organic ligand begins to decompose: indeed, in air \n\nthe decomposition is much faster than in nitrogen as depicted in Figure B.1.3 (in the \n\nAppendices). \n\n\n\n1D-3D MOFs Based on (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic Acid \n\n149 \n \n\nAfter the decomposition of the organic ligand, which occurs above ca. 700 \u00baC, \n\npowder X-ray diffraction studies (PDF4+ 2012 release ICDD database) showed that the \n\nresidue was composed of lanthanum catenatriphosphate (LaP3O9, ICDD 00-033-0717), \n\nwhich further evolved (at ca. 900 \u00baC) to a mixture composed of LaP3O9 and monazite \n\n(LaPO4, ICDD 01-071-6745). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6 - Thermogram and VTPXRD studies of \n[La(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O (9). Phase transformations promoted by \ntemperature increase are depicted using an asterisk (*). All studies have been \nperformed in air. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.4. FT-IR Spectroscopic Studies \n  \n\nThe FT-IR spectra (Figure 4.7) of the isotypical \n\n[Ln(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O materials [where Ln\n3+ = La3+ (9), (La0.97Eu0.03)\n\n3+ (10) \n\nand (La0.97Tb0.03)\n3+ (11)] exhibit a number of bands which are diagnostic of the \n\nstructural features of the materials. This subsection discusses only the spectral features \n\nof compound 9, being the conclusions also valid for 10 and 11.  \n\nThe material contains in its crystal structure several types of water molecules \n\nwith very distinct crystallographic environment. This structural feature is markedly \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n150 \n \n\nvisible in the FT-IR spectrum, particularly in the 3750-2100 cm-1 spectral range which \n\nis dominated by the O?H vibrational modes of water molecules. The two sharp bands of \n\nmedium intensity located at ca. 3629 and 3546 cm-1 correspond to the ?(O?H) \n\nstretching vibrational modes of coordinated water molecules. The same features are \n\nobserved for the lattice water molecules of crystallization with the occurrence of two \n\nweak broad bands centered at around 3338 and 3225 cm-1. These assignments were \n\nunequivocally confirmed from analyses on the dehydrated material: after thermal \n\ntreatment at ca. 190 \u00baC (data not shown) the broad bands associated with the lattice \n\nwater molecules of crystallization completely disappear, and those of the coordinated \n\nmoieties (sharp bands) are almost extinguished (please note: according to the \n\nthermogravimetric studies at this temperature the release of all water molecules may not \n\nbe complete; this data is in good agreement with the performed thermogravimetric \n\nstudies). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7 - FT-IR spectra of the [Ln(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O materials \n[where Ln3+ = La3+ (9), (La0.97Eu0.03)\n\n3+ (10) and (La0.97Tb0.03)\n3+ (11)]. \n\n\n\n1D-3D MOFs Based on (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic Acid \n\n151 \n \n\nThe presence of two bands for each type of water molecule agrees well with the \n\ncrystallographic studies that show that there are two levels of strength for the hydrogen \n\nbonding interactions involving such moieties: for example, for the coordinated O1W \n\nand O2W water molecules it is possible to see that the latter is engaged in stronger \n\ninteractions than the former based solely on the inter-nuclear distances between donor \n\nand acceptor (Table 4.1); regarding the water molecules of crystallization (O3W, O4W \n\nand O5W), the hydrogen bonding network is composed of strong connections \n\n(internuclear distances ranging from ca. 2.55 to 2.75 \u00c5) and weaker interactions \n\n(distances in the ca. 2.96-3.16 \u00c5 \u2013 see Table 4.1). As a consequence, the O?H bonds for \n\nthese molecules have overall two levels of strength that are ultimately reflected into \n\ndifferent bands in the FT-IR spectrum. In this wide spectral region the typical ?(O?H) \n\nand ?(C?H) stretching vibrational modes of PO?H and ?CH2? are also found: between \n\nca. 3085 and 2715 cm-1 for both groups, and at around 2437 cm-1 for PO?H in which \n\nthe hydrogen atom is probably involved in hydrogen-bonding interactions. \n\nBelow ca. 1750 cm-1 the FT-IR spectrum of 9 is complex with a large number of \n\nmedium-to-very strong vibration bands arising from the organic ligand. Based in the \n\nliterature,9 at ca. 1648 cm-1 one observes the in-plane deformation of water molecules, \n\nfollowed of the medium intensity band at ca. 1606 cm-1 attributed to the typical \n\n?(?C=C?) stretching vibrations of the aromatic ring. At ca. 1459, 1412 and 1407 cm-1 \n\nthe ?CH2? deformation vibrational modes from the P?CH2 groups are visible. \n\nAdditionally, two sets of vibration bands in the 1350-1150 cm-1 and 1025-915 cm-1 \n\nranges include the ?(P=O) and ?(P?O) modes, respectively. The ?(P?C) stretching \n\nvibrational modes are found at ca. 753 and 718 cm-1. \n\n \n\n4.2.5. Solid-State NMR: [La(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O \n\n \n\nIn order to get a better insight into the phase purity and composition of the \n\nasymmetric unit, solid-state NMR studies have been performed on the diamagnetic \n\n[La(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O (9) material. The \n31P MAS spectrum of 9 shows, in \n\nthe isotropic region, three well-resolved sharp resonances centered at ca. 17.0, 22.1 and \n\n26.7 ppm (Figure 4.8). This information agrees well with the presence of three \n\ncrystallographically distinct phosphorus sites. Peak deconvolution and integration, \n\nincluding the spinning sidebands, provides a ratio of ca. 1.00 : 0.92 : 0.94 for each \n\nresonance, respectively. \n\nThe 13C{1H} CP MAS spectrum (Figure B.1.4 in the Appendices) is composed \n\nof two distinct spectral regions. The ca. 20-45 ppm range comprises two resonances at \n\nca. 32.5 (shoulder) and 34.2 ppm, attributed to the \u2013CH2? groups of the organic ligand. \n\nIn the 120-140 ppm spectral region the resonances of the aromatic carbon atoms appear \n\npeaking at ca. 128.3, 128.9, 132.1 and 133.7 ppm. In summary, data from the 31P MAS \n\nspectrum is unequivocal strongly indicating the presence in the asymmetric unit of only \n\none organic molecule, in good agreement with the crystallographic studies. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n152 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8 - \n31P HPDEC MAS spectrum of [La(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O (9). \n\nSpinning sidebands are denoted using an asterisk.

Heterogeneous catalysis \n \n\nThe catalytic performance of [La(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O (9) was explored \n\nin the methanolysis of styrene oxide (PhEtO) (see Scheme 3.1 in Chapter 3).

The catalytic stability of 9 was investigated by reusing the washed-\n\ndried catalyst: slightly decrease in the PhEtO conversion and MeOPhEtOH yield at 30 \n\nmin reaction were observed for four consecutive batch runs. These differences are less \n\npronounced when comparing the results for 1h reaction (Figure 4.12). \n\n \n\nTable 4.3 - Reaction of PhEtO with methanol to MeOPhEtOH in the presence of 9 \nor of corresponding synthetic precursors as catalysts.a \n\nCatalyst \ninitialCatalyst \n\namount \n\nTemp.b \n\n(\u00baC) \nReaction time \n\nMeOPhEtOH \n\nyield (%) \n\n9 20 g(9) L\n-1 c 55 30 min 100 \n\n9 3.3 g(9) L\n-1 55 30 min / 1 h 95 / 100 \n\n9 20 g(9) L\n-1 35 30 min / 1 h 96 / 100 \n\n9 3.3 g(9) L\n-1 35 1 h / 6 h 40 / 100 \n\nH6bmt 3.5 mM \nd 35 30 min / 1 h 99 / 100 \n\nLaCl3\u00b77H2O 3.5 mM\n d 35 3 h 4 e \n\na Reaction conditions: 0.4 M PhEtO, 800 rpm. b Reaction temperature. c Catalyst \nbulk density of 9 expressed as initial mass of solid per volume of reaction mixture. \nd Initial concentration of precursor which was completely dissolved (homogeneous \ncatalyst).  \ne Conversion was 4%. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n156 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.12 - Reaction of styrene oxide (PhEtO) with methanol to afford 2-\nmethoxy-2-phenylethanol in the presence of the heterogeneous catalyst \n[La(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O (9) in four consecutive batch runs.

Despite a decrease in the \n\ncrystal size of catalyst 9 recovered after first catalytic run (maintaining in the \n\nsubsequent batch runs), the structure of 9 was preserved without visible modifications. \n\nThe morphological changes may lead to the observed slight catalyst deactivation, \n\npossibly due to the destruction of some active sites. Nevertheless, the catalytic \n\nperformance of 9 in recycling runs was fairly good without catalyst regeneration steps. \n\nA six-fold decrease in the catalyst bulk density (from 20 to 3.3 g L-1) led to \n\ncomparably outstanding catalytic results: 95%/100% MeOPhEtOH at 30 min/1 h \n\nreaction, 55 \u00baC (Table 4.2). Furthermore, at approximately ambient temperature (35 \u00baC) \n\nand using a catalyst bulk density of 20 g(9) L\n-1, quantitative MeOPhEtOH yield was \n\nreached at 1 h reaction. Decreasing the catalyst bulk density from 20 to 3.3 g(9) L\n-1 at 35 \n\n\u00baC resulted in a slower reaction; nevertheless, after 6 h reaction, 100% MeOPhEtOH \n\nyield was reached (Table 4.2). The leaching tests for 9 (fresh) and for the catalyst \n\nrecovered after a 6 h-batch run at 35 \u00baC led to&lt;2% conversion which is minor \n\ncompared to that observed  in the presence of 9 (100% conversion, Table 4.3) indicating \n\nthat the catalytic reaction is heterogeneous in nature. \n\nIn order to get insights into the type of active sites responsible for the catalytic \n\nactivity of 9, the reaction of PhEtO was carried out in the presence of catalytic amounts \n\nof the corresponding ligand and lanthanide precursors, namely H6bmt and LaCl3\u00b77H2O \n\n(used in equivalent amounts to those corresponding to 3.3 g(9) L\n-1).

In contrast, the H6bmt ligand precursor led to 100% MeOPhEtOH yield at 1 h \n\nreaction. These results suggest that Br\u00f6nsted acidity renders the epoxide more \n\nsusceptible to nucleophilic attack by the alcohol than Lewis acidity, leading to faster \n\nalcoholysis of the epoxide.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.13 - PXRD patterns and SEM images of the as-prepared \n[La(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O (9) material and after consecutive batch runs (up \nto four) in the reaction of styrene oxide with methanol.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n158 \n \n\n4.3. Hydrothermal Synthesis of Layered 2D Lanthanide-\n\nOrganic Frameworks \n\n \n\n4.3.1. Hydrothermal Synthesis \n\n \n\nThe transformation of mixtures composed of H6bmt with the respective \n\nlanthanide chloride salts under hydrothermal conditions led to the isolation of a new \n\nfamily of layered 2D Lanthanide-Organic Frameworks, formulated as \n\n[Ln2(H3bmt)2]\u00b7H2O [where Ln\n3+ = Eu3+ (12), Gd3+ (13), Tb3+ (14), Dy3+ (15), Ho3+ (16), \n\nEr3+ (17), Tm3+ (18) and Yb3+ (19)] (see sub-section 8.11.2.1 in the Experimental \n\nSection for further details on the synthesis).  \n\nBecause the 2D [Ln2(H3bmt)2]\u00b7H2O materials are solely composed of \n\nmicrocrystalline powders, phase identification and crystal solution were performed from \n\nRietveld refinement studies using laboratory powder X-ray diffraction data.

A \n\nmore unequivocal and detailed study is in progress using high-resolution synchrotron \n\ndata collected both at ID31 (ESRF, Grenoble, France) and at I11 (DLS, Oxford, United \n\nKingdom). The remaining materials belonging to the [Ln2(H3bmt)2]\u00b7H2O series were \n\ncharacterized by PXRD which allowed to confirm the structural similarities between all \n\ncompounds (Figure 4.15). The inclusion of different lanthanide centers affects, \n\nnevertheless, the collected PXRD patterns: going from Eu3+ to Yb3+ there is an average \n\nincrease of the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peaks. This \n\nbehavior is characteristic of materials with decreasing size of the crystallites (Figure \n\n4.15). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.15 \u2013 PXRD patterns of the 2D [Ln2(H3bmt)2]\u00b7H2O materials [where Ln\n3+ \n\n= Eu3+ (12), Gd3+ (13), Tb3+ (14), Dy3+ (15), Ho3+ (16), Er3+ (17), Tm3+ (18) and \nYb3+ (19)]. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n160 \n \n\nSEM studies performed on the bulk [Ln2(H3bmt)2]\u00b7H2O materials so to analyze \n\ncrystal morphology further support the aforementioned assumption (Figure 4.16). \n\nDespite the morphological differences between the compounds, it is noteworthy a clear \n\ndecrease in the average particle size of the compounds. Indeed, compounds containing \n\nin their structure lanthanide centers with lower atomic number (i.e., larger ionic radius), \n\nas for instance Eu3+ and Gd3+, are composed of larger particles. Using Yb3+, the last \n\nelement of the lanthanide series, as the metal center a isotypical material is obtained but, \n\nin this case, formed of much smaller crystallites. Because the reaction conditions to \n\nprepare all [Ln2(H3bmt)2]\u00b7H2O materials were identical (see sub-section 8.10.2.1 in the \n\nof the Experimental Section for further details), these results clearly suggest that the \n\ndecrease of the average particle size is due to the decrease of the ionic radius of the \n\nemployed lanthanide center. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.16 \u2013 SEM images of the 2D [Ln2(H3bmt)2]\u00b7H2O materials [where Ln\n3+ = \n\nEu3+ (a), Gd3+ (b), Tb3+ (c), Dy3+ (d), Ho3+ (e), Er3+ (f), Tm3+ (g) and Yb3+ (h)]. \n \n\n \n\n4.3.2. Crystal Structure Description of [Eu2(H3pmt)2]\u00b7H2O \n\n \n\nPreliminary powder X-ray diffraction studies provide insight on the cystal \n\nstructure of the novel 2D [Eu2(H3bmt)2]\u00b7H2O (12) material. Compound 12 crystallizes in \n\nthe monoclinic P21/n space group, with the asymmetric unit comprising a single Eu\n3+ \n\nmetallic center, one H3bmt\n3- bridging organic linker and half of one water molecule of \n\ncrystallization. The coordination sphere of Eu3+ center is composed of six phosphonate \n\ngroups describing a distorted octahedral coordination geometry as depicted in Figure \n\n4.17. The metallic center is, thus, coordinated to a total of six oxygen atoms, {EuO6}, \n\nall connected to the metallic center by way of a syn-bridging coordination mode. \n\nCompound 12 contains a two-dimensional ?\n2[Eu2(H3bmt)2] network placed on the \n\nab plane of the unit cell (Figure 4.18a). Hydrogen bonding between individual \n\n?\n2[Eu2(H3bmt)2] layers leads to the formation of a compact structure as described in \n\nFigure 4.18b. \n\n \n\n\n\n1D-3D MOFs Based on (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic Acid \n\n161 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.17 \u2013 Mixed ball-and-stick and polyhedral representation of the \ncoordination environment of the Eu3+ metallic center present in [Eu2(H3bmt)2]\u00b7H2O \n(12). \n \n \n\n \nFigure 4.18 \u2013 (a) View along the [001] direction of the unit cell of the two-\ndimensional ?\n\n2[Eu2(H3bmt)2] MOF present in the crystal structure of compound 12. \n(b) Crystal packing of 12 viewed in perspective along the [00-1] direction of the \nunit cell. {LaO6} octahedra and {PO3C} tetrahedra are represented in green and \npurple, respectively.

Thermogravimetry and Thermodiffractometry \n\n \n\nThe thermal stability of the 2D layered [Ln2(H3bmt)2]\u00b7H2O materials [where \n\nLn3+ = Eu3+ (12), Gd3+ (13), Tb3+ (14), Dy3+ (15), Ho3+ (16), Er3+ (17), Tm3+ (18) and \n\nYb3+ (19)] were studied from ambient temperature to 800 \u00baC. Thermograms show \n\nslightly different weight loss profiles for each materials (Figure B.2.1 in the \n\nAppendices). The decomposition pathways observed for compounds that have \n\nlanthanide centers with higher atomic numbers (as for instance Yb3+) are less defined \n\nthan those for compounds possessing lanthanides with lower atomic numbers. This fact \n\nmay be attributed to the decrease of the particle size: as mentioned in section 4.3.1 \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n162 \n \n\n(supported by the SEM images) the Yb3+ material is mainly composed of nanoparticles. \n\nAs a consequence, the overall thermal stability of these compounds is lower, leading to \n\nthermal decompositions also at lower temperatures. Nevertheless, despite these \n\ndifferences, the thermal decomposition of all materials occurs in the same general way. \n\nIn order to evaluate the effect of increasing temperature in the crystal structure \n\nVTPXRD studies have been performed for 12 in the 30-510 \u00baC range (Figure 4.19 \u2013 \n\nright). The discussion is solely focused on the thermal behavior of compound 12, being \n\nassumed that this behavior is similar for the remaining members of the isotypical series. \n\nVTPXRD patterns show that compound 12 is thermally robust up to ca. 370 \u00baC. \n\nFrom the thermogram of 12 (Figure 4.19 \u2013 left), the first weight loss occurs in the ca. \n\n163-255 \u00baC range corresponding to the release of the water molecules of crystallization: \n\nnoteworthy, the observed weight loss of 1.3% is slightly lower than the expected one \n\n(1.7%). At higher temperature there is a second decomposition of 4.9%. The various \n\nprotonated P-OH moieties may be at the genesis of a dehydration process that occurs \n\nfrom ca. 255 to 532 \u00baC leading to this additional loss of water. Indeed, VTPXRD studies \n\nshow a significant modification in the structure (mainly, loss of crystallinity) of 12 \n\nwithin this temperature range. The structure of compound 12 starts to decompose above \n\nthis temperature. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.19 - Thermogram and VTPXRD studies of the [Eu2(H3bmt)2] (12) \nmaterial. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3.4. FT-IR Spectroscopic Studies \n\n \n\nFT-IR spectra of the 2D [Ln2(H3bmt)2]\u00b7H2O materials [where Ln\n3+ = Eu3+ (12), \n\nGd3+ (13), Tb3+ (14), Dy3+ (15), Ho3+ (16), Er3+ (17), Tm3+ (18) and Yb3+ (19)] were \n\ncollected so to further investigate some structural details previously described (Figure \n\n4.20 and Figure B.2.2 in the Appendices). Figure 4.20 depicts selected spectral regions \n\nemphasizing a number of vibrational bands of the most structurally-relevant functional \n\n\n\n1D-3D MOFs Based on (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic Acid \n\n163 \n \n\ngroups present in 12. Due to the very similar spectral profiles, only compound 12 will \n\nbe described with more detail in the following paragraphs, being the conclusions also \n\nvalid for the remaining materials. \n\nThe FT-IR spectrum of 12 is dominated by two spectral regions. In the ca. 3750-\n\n2500 cm-1 range it is possible to observe the typical ?(POH) vibrational mode of strong \n\nintensity centered at ca. 3607 cm-1. At ca. 3397 cm-1 the ?(O?H) stretching vibrations of \n\nthe water molecules of crystallization and a broad band in the ca. 3328-2865 cm-1 \n\nspectral range belonging to the ?(POH) and ?(C?H) stretching vibrations of the ?CH2? \n\ngroups also appear in this region. \n\nBelow 1800 cm-1 the FT-IR spectrum of 12 is complex with a large number of \n\nweak-to-very strong bands.9 At ca. 1615 and 1605 cm-1 the typical ?(H2O) and \n\n?(?C=C?) in-plane deformations are markedly visible. Two bands of medium intensity \n\npeaking at ca. 1460 and 1410 cm-1 are attributed to the ?CH2? deformation vibrational \n\nmodes from the P?CH2 groups. Additionally, three vibrational bands are also visible in \n\nthe FT-IR spectrum: i) the ?(P=O) appear in the 1176-1035 cm-1 range; ii) the ?(P?O) \n\nmode is identified at ca. 931 cm-1 as a vibration band with very strong intensity; iii) the \n\n?(P?C) stretching vibrational modes appear as weak bands centered at ca. 771 and 756 \n\ncm-1. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.20 - FT-IR spectra of the layered [Eu2(H3bmt)2]\u00b7H2O (12) material. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n164 \n \n\n4.4.

Synthesis occurred under typical hydrothermal conditions at a \n\ntemperature of 180 \u00baC, under autogeneous pressure, over a period of 3 days (see sub-\n\nsection 8.11.3.1 in the Experimental Section for further details). The structural features \n\nof these materials could, therefore, be readily unveiled using single-crystal X-ray \n\ndiffraction studies as described in the following subsection. Independently of the \n\nlanthanide (or mixture of lanthanides for the optically-active materials 24 and 25), these \n\nconditions were highly reproducible, systematically yielding crystalline products of the \n\ndesired phases. Phase purity and homogeneity of the bulk samples 20 to 25 have been \n\nconfirmed also by PXRD (Figure 4.21). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.20 \u2013 PXRD patterns of the [Ln2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O materials [where \nLn3+ = La3+ (20), Ce3+ (21), Pr3+ (22), Nd3+ (23), (La0.95Eu0.05)\n\n3+ (24) and \n(La0.95Tb0.05)\n\n3+ (25)]. \n\n\n\n1D-3D MOFs Based on (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic Acid \n\n165 \n \n\nAiming to investigate if milder conditions could be employed, the preparation of \n\n20 was further tested at 100 \u00baC for reactions times ranging from 1 to 3 days, also under \n\nconventional hydrothermal conditions. Results suggest that the desired pure-phase could \n\nbe readily isolated under all the tested conditions as large single crystals (Figure 4.22). \n\nAdditionally, and as described in the sub-section 4.2.1, MWAS also proved to be an \n\nexcellent alternative to prepare 20 with large particles. This method brings the \n\nadditional advantage of drastically reducing the preparation time from 1 day to only 5 \n\nminutes. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.22 - SEM images emphasizing the crystal morphology of the \n[La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (20) material prepared at mild temperatures (100 \u00baC) and \nover different periods of time. \n\n \n\n \n\nOptically-active materials containing Eu3+ and Tb3+ embedded into La3+ \n\nmatrices, were isolated as bulk microcrystalline materials by including in the reactive \n\ngels 5% of Eu3+ or Tb3+ salts (in mol; see sub-section 8.11.3.1 in the Experimental \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n166 \n \n\nSection for details). We note that this methodology of preparing optically-active \n\nmaterials permits, on the one hand, to guarantee that the framework structure is not \n\naltered due to the known lanthanide contraction effect and, on the other, that Eu3+ and \n\nTb3+ cations are statistically diluted in the networks so to prevent self-quenching effects. \n\n \n\n4.4.2.

The crystal structure of the dehydrated \n\nmaterial of 20 ([La(H3bmt)], 20-dehyd) was also unequivocally unveiled from single-\n\ncrystal X-ray diffraction. The structural details in the following paragraphs will be, \n\ntherefore, solely based on the La3+ materials (as-prepared and dehydrated), and are \n\nassumed to be valid for the remaining members of the series. \n\nThe asymmetric units of 20 and 20-dehyd are composed of a single \n\ncrystallographically independent La3+ centre and one entire molecular unit of the \n\ndeprotonated H3bmt\n3- organic linker. These crystallographic details are in good \n\nagreement with the structural features derived from both the solid-state NMR studies \n\nand the detailed photoluminescence investigations (see following bub-sections). In 20, \n\nthe La3+ center is eight-coordinated, {LaO8}, to a total of six phosphonate groups (from \n\nsix symmetry-related H3bmt\n3- anionic ligands) and one disordered water molecule (over \n\ntwo distinct locations - O1W and O2W - with 50% of rate of occupancy for each), with \n\nthe overall coordination polyhedron resembling a highly distorted capped pentagonal \n\nbipyramid. The removal of the coordinated water molecule to yield 20-dehyd (by \n\nheating above 100 \u00baC with or without high vacuum), leads to a seven-coordination \n\nenvironment, {LaO7}, with the overall geometry now resembling a simple distorted \n\npentagonal bipyramid (the capping position was occupied by the solvent molecule - see \n\nFigures 4.23a and 4.23b).  \n\nThis seamless transformation is concomitantly accompanied by only small \n\nadjustments in the geometrical parameters of the coordination polyhedra, as clearly \n\nregistered by the tabulated La\u2013O distances and O\u2013La\u2013O angles given in Tables B.3.1 \n\nand B.3.2, respectively, in the Appendices. These small modifications are attributed to \n\nthe intrinsic need to accommodate the extra coordinative position left vacant by the \n\nliberation of the coordinated solvent molecule. The La\u2013O bond lengths are, therefore, \n\nfound in the 2.3365(18)-2.6908(17) \u00c5 and 2.3293(14)-2.6459(12) \u00c5 ranges for 20 and \n\n20-dehyd, respectively. As expected, the reduction in the coordination number of La3+ \n\nalso leads to a reduction of all bond lengths. It is further noted that the longest La\u2013O \n\nbond lengths registered for both structures [2.6908(17) and 2.6029(16) \u00c5 for 20; \n\n2.6459(12) and 2.6012(12) \u00c5 for 20-dehyd - see Table B.3.1 in the Appendices] are \n\ndirectly associated with the P2 phosphonate group which has a pivotal role in the \n\n\n\n1D-3D MOFs Based on (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic Acid \n\n167 \n \n\nstructure architectures: besides being the sole phosphonate group which is O,O-chelated \n\nto La3+ (bite angles of 55.44(5) and 55.80(4)\u00ba for 20 and 20-dehyd, respectively; see \n\nFigures 4.23a and 4.23b), it further establishes physical connections between three \n\nadjacent metallic centres, leading to the formation of a one-dimensional zigzag \n\nlanthanum oxide chain running parallel to the [010] direction of the unit cell, assembled \n\nfrom edge-sharing of {LaO8} or {LaO7} polyhedra (Figures  4.23c, 4.23d and 4.24). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.23 - Side by side comparison between the La3+ coordination \nenvironments and crystal packing features of [La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (20) and \n[La(H3bmt)] (20-dehyd).

(c) and (d) Crystal packing of 20 and \n20-dehyd viewed in perspective along the [010] direction of the unit cell. The \ndisordered water molecules of crystallization and those coordinated to the La3+ in \n20 are depicted in space-filling mode (zoom perspective in (e)) so to better \nillustrate the presence of framework apertures which facilitate the removal of these \nmoieties upon heating of the material. Hydrogen bonding interactions are shown as \ndashed dark green lines. For details on the geometry of the represented O\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O \ninteractions see Table B.3.3 in the Appendices. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n168 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.24 - Fragments of the crystal structures of [La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (20) \nand [La(H3bmt)] (20-dehyd) showing the lanthanum oxide chains formed by the \nedge-sharing of either {LaO8} or {LaO7} polyhedra. The representation depicts \nhow the release of the coordinated water molecules in 20 affects the hydrogen \nbonding network present in the crystal structures and the inter-lanthanide distance \nacross the zigzag chains. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe typical zeolitic-type behaviour observed for the [Ln2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O \n\nmaterials concerning the water molecules can be rationalized taking solely into \n\nconsideration the structural features of the networks. Both the coordinated and \n\ncrystallization water molecules are located in hydrophilic cavities in the structure, \n\ndistributed in a parallel fashion to the aforementioned lanthanum oxide chains which, \n\nunder high temperatures or high vacuum, constitute an effective escape route for the \n\nsolvent molecules (Figures 4.23c, 4.23d and 4.23e). This process motivates a structural \n\nmodification of the lanthanum oxide chains. On the one hand, the observed intermetallic \n\n\n\n1D-3D MOFs Based on (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic Acid \n\n169 \n \n\nLa\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7La distance is reduced by ca. 3% from 4.1984(2) \u00c5 to 4.0864(6) \u00c5. On the other \n\nhand, the absence of the water molecules (coordinated and in the cavities), which are \n\nengaged in O\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds with the neighbouring P1 phosphonate group \n\n(Table B.3.3), induces a modification of the hydrogen bonding network: the P1\u2013O2\u2013H2 \n\nmoiety becomes free to rotate and establish a new interaction with the neighbouring \n\nO,O-chelated P2 phosphonate group (Figure 4.24). \n\n \n\n4.4.3. Thermogravimetry and Thermodiffractometry \n\n \n\nBulk [Ln2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O materials [where Ln\n3+ = La3+ (20), Ce3+ (21), \n\nPr3+ (22), Nd3+ (23), (La0.95Eu0.05)\n3+ (24) and (La0.95Tb0.05)\n\n3+ (25)] exhibit similar \n\nthermal stabilities with increasing temperature (thermogram for 20 given in Figure 4.25; \n\nthermograms for 21-25 are provided in Figure B.3.1 in the Appendices). In order to \n\nfully understand the structural modifications of the materials with temperature, \n\nthermodiffractometry between ambient temperature and ca. 600 \u00baC was performed for \n\n[La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (20) (Figure 4.25). We note that the results and conclusions \n\ndescribed in the following paragraphs have only been experimentally derived for the \n\nLa3+-based material (20). It is, however, feasible to assume that all members of this \n\nseries should behave in a very similar fashion as, for example, concluded from the \n\nphotoluminescent studies on the mixed-lanthanide materials.  \n\nBetween ambient temperature and ca. 265 \u00baC, 20 releases a total of 4.9% of its \n\nweight in a clear two-step fashion (peaks at 69 and 162 \u00baC). This loss agrees well with \n\nthe release of the total amount of water molecules described by the empirical formula \n\n(for 3 water molecules a theoretical weight loss of ca. 5.2% is estimated). As found \n\nfrom the crystallographic studies (see above), the structures house a total of one \n\ndisordered water molecule which is readily released in a very early stage: between \n\nambient temperature and ca. 130 \u00baC there is a continuous weight loss of 1.4% \n\ncorresponding to the liberation of the solvent of crystallization (calculated of ca. 1.7%). \n\nFrom the thermodiffractometry studies one notes that this release induces very small \n\nmodifications in the crystal structure. The second stage of solvent liberation \n\ncorresponds to those that are coordinated to the La3+ centers (see structural details \n\nbelow), occurring between ca. 130 and 265 \u00baC (weigh loss observed 3.5%, calculated \n\n3.4%): above ca. 130 \u00baC the PXRD patterns clearly show a progressive structural \n\nmodification of the material up to the in situ formation of the completely dehydrated \n\nform, [La(H3bmt)] (20-dehyd). This framework remains structurally stable over a \n\ntemperature window of about 150 \u00baC. At ca. 420 \u00baC thermal decomposition (most \n\nprobably due to oxidation of the organic component) settles in, leading to the formation \n\nof an amorphous residue (Figure 4.25). \n\nIt is worth noting that the complete dehydration of 20 could be achieved by \n\neither increasing the temperature (as described above), or by placing the material under \n\na high vacuum (as ascertained from the photoluminescence studies for the mixed-\n\nlanthanide material with Eu3+ - see subsection 4.4.5). The completely dehydrated \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n170 \n \n\nmaterials could readily revert to their original form with exposure to air. We note that \n\nthis typical zeolitic behaviour was tested in situ for a number of cycles with little, or no \n\nloss, of overall crystallinity. This structural robustness was of crucial importance to \n\nisolate the completely dehydrated material and unveil its crystal structure from single-\n\ncrystal X-ray diffraction studies (see above). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.25 - Thermogram and variable temperature powder X-ray \ndiffraction study of [La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (20). \n\n \n\n \n\n4.4.4. Solid-State NMR and FT-IR Spectroscopy Studies \n\n \n\nThe 31P MAS spectrum of 20 shows the presence of three well-resolved isotropic \n\nresonances peaking at 15.3, 19.7 and 23.4 ppm (Figure 4.26). In addition, peak \n\ndeconvolution and integration including the spinning sidebands yields a ratio of ca. \n\n1.00 : 1.04 : 1.01 for these resonances. The 13C{1H} CP MAS spectrum (Figure B.3.2 in \n\nthe Appendices) clearly shows two distinct spectral regions: the 29-41 ppm spectral \n\nrange (peaks at: 35.4 ppm and 36.8 ppm - shoulder) is attributed to the \u2013CH2\u2013 groups, \n\nwith its deficiency of spectral resolution being simultaneously attributed to very similar \n\nchemical environments (for the three expected groups) and to the likely existence of \n\nspin multiplets arising from 1JC,P coupling (usually in the 5-90 Hz range);\n17 the aromatic \n\ncarbon atoms from the ring appear in the 124-139 ppm window (peaks at: 129.4, 130.1, \n\n133.1 and 135.7 ppm). This bulk technique clearly supports the existence of a single \n\ncrystallographically unique H3bmt\n3- organic PBU in the asymmetric unit. Additionally, \n\n\n\n1D-3D MOFs Based on (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic Acid \n\n171 \n \n\nand based on the performed photoluminescence studies (see dedicated section below), \n\nthe material should also contain a single independent lanthanide center. These results \n\nare in perfect agreement with the performed crystallographic studies, also indicating \n\nphase purity and homogeneity. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.26 - 31P HPDEC MAS spectrum of [La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (20). \nSpinning sidebands are depicted by an asterisk. Peak deconvolution and integration \nthroughout the entire spectral range (i.e., including the spinning sidebands) gives a \nratio of ca. 1.00 : 1.04 : 1.01 for the isotropic resonances at ca. 15.3, 19.7 and 23.4 \nppm, respectively, which is in perfect agreement with the crystal structure \ndetermination of the same material. \n\n \n\n \n\nAs also ascertained by PXRD studies, vibrational FT-IR spectroscopy studies \n\nclearly support that bulk materials 20 to 25 are indeed isotypical (see Figure 4.27 for \n\ncompound 20 and Figure B.3.3 in the Appendices for the remaining compounds 21-25). \n\nFigure 4.27 shows the two most relevant regions of the spectra providing temptative \n\nassignments for the most diagnostic vibrational bands of compound 20. Those present in \n\nthe 3750-2500 cm-1 region arise mainly from stretching vibrations of O\u2013H groups (from \n\nwater molecules, both coordinated and of crystallization, and the PO\u2013H groups) and \u2013\n\nCH2\u2013 groups. Between 350 and 1700 cm\n-1 the spectra are significantly more complex \n\nbeing dominated by the vibrational modes associated with coordinated phosphonate \n\ngroups, aromatic ring vibrations and the in-plane deformation of water molecules \n\n(peaking around ca. 1600 cm-1).9 \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n172 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.27 - FT-IR spectrum of the [La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O material (20). \n \n\n \n\n4.4.5. Photoluminescence \n\n \n\nThe inclusion of optically-active lanthanide centers (such as Eu3+ and Tb3+) into \n\nthe La3+ matrix of compound 20 leads to the formation of new materials capable of \n\nconverting UV radiation into visible light at ambient temperature as depicted in Figure \n\n4.28 for [(La0.95Eu0.05)2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (24) and [(La0.95Tb0.05)2(H3bmt)2]\u00b7H2O \n\n(25). The excitation and emission spectra, and the 5D4 decay curves of 25 and its \n\ndehydrated form, [(La0.95Tb0.05)(H3bmt)] (25-dehyd), are provided in Figure B.3.4 in \n\nthe Appendices. The following paragraphs focus the discussion only on the Eu3+-\n\ncontaining compounds. It is also briefly discussed the photoluminescence properties of \n\ncompound [La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (24), which are characteristic of its organic PBUs \n\nand can only be discerned at low temperature. \n\n \nFigure 4.28 - Visible emission of the [(La0.95Eu0.05)2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (24)  and \n[(La0.95Tb0.05)2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (25) materials when irradiated using a \nlaboratory UV lamp (? = 254 nm). \n\n\n\n1D-3D MOFs Based on (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic Acid \n\n173 \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.29 - (a) Excitation spectrum of [La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (20) at 11 K \n(green line) while monitoring the emission at 445 nm, and excitation spectra of \n[(La0.95Eu0.05)2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (24) at 298 (black line) and 11 K (red line) \nwhile monitoring the Eu3+ emission at 611.4 nm. (b) Excitation spectra of \n[(La0.95Eu0.05)(H3bmt)] (24-dehyd) at 298 (black line) and 11 K (red line) while \nmonitoring the emission at 612.2 nm. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe excitation spectra of [(La0.95Eu0.05)2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (24) was recorded \n\nat 298 and 11 K while monitoring within the Eu3+ 5D0?\n7F2 transition (Figure 4.29a). \n\nBoth spectra are dominated by two broad UV bands (240-288 and 288-340 nm) which \n\nmay be attributed to ?-?* transitions of the organic PBUs. This attribution was \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n174 \n \n\nconfirmed recording at 11 K the excitation spectrum of 20 while monitoring the \n\nphosphorescence emission at 445 nm (Figure 4.29a). The sharp lines are assigned to the \n7F0,1?\n\n5D1-4, \n5L6, \n\n5G2-6, \n5H3-7 and \n\n5F1-5 Eu\n3+ intra-4f6 transitions. A similar band \n\nassignment of the excitation spectra can be performed for the fully dehydrated form of \n\n24, [(La0.95Eu0.05)(H3bmt)] (24-dehyd) (Figure 4.29b), prepared in situ from the \n\ndehydration of 24 at ca. 450 K and under a high vacuum (ca. 5\u00d710-6 mbar). For this \n\nlatter material the intensity of the UV broad bands are significantly more distinct and \n\nthe Eu3+ intra-4f6 transitions are more noticeable, in particular the 7F0?\n5D0 transition \n\nwhich is almost absent in 24. \n\nThe emission spectra of 24 and 24-dehyd recorded at 298 and 11 K (excited at \n\n393 nm) are provided in Figures 4.30a and 4.30b, respectively. The sharp lines are \n\nassigned to transitions between the first excited non-degenerate 5D0 state and the \n7F0-4 \n\nlevels of the fundamental Eu3+ septet. Except for 5D0?\n7F1, which has a predominant \n\nmagnetic-dipole character independent of the Eu3+ crystal site, the observed transitions \n\nare mainly of electric-dipole nature. The presence of one single line for the 5D0?\n7F0 \n\ntransition and the local-field splitting of the 7F1,2\n levels into three and a maximum of \n\nfive Stark components, respectively, and the predominance of the 5D0?\n7F2 transition \n\nrelatively to the 5D0?\n7F1, indicates the presence of a single low-symmetry Eu\n\n3+ \n\nenvironment without inversion symmetry in both structures, as supported by the crystal \n\nstructure determination (see dedicated section for details). Eu3+ emission is highly \n\nsensitive to small modifications on the first coordination sphere of the metal, such as the \n\nvariation of the number and type of coordinated moieties. Thus, the reversible \n\ntransformation of 24 into 24-dehyd, due to the release and subsequent absorption of \n\nwater molecules, can easily be accompanied by photoluminescence (Figures 4.30c and \n\n4.30d). Under the employed experimental conditions (high vacuum), the structural \n\nchange on the first coordination sphere of Eu3+ starts at ca. 350 K and is nearly \n\ncomplete at 400 K (Figure 4.30c). The starting form can be regenerated with subsequent \n\nexposure of the dehydrated material to air under normal ambient conditions (Figure \n\n4.30d). We note that these temperatures are slightly distinct, but still very comparable, \n\nto those observed both in the TGA measurements and in the thermodiffractometry \n\nstudies (see sub-section 4.4.3). We attribute the small differences to the fact that the \n\nphotoluminescence studies have been performed under vacuum, which greatly \n\nfacilitates the release of all water molecules.  \n\n \n\n\n\n1D-3D MOFs Based on (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic Acid \n\n175 \n \n\n \nFigure 4.30 - (a and b) Emission spectra of [(La0.95Eu0.05)2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O \n(24) and [(La0.95Eu0.05)(H3bmt)] (24-dehyd), respectively, at 298 (black line) and \n11 K (red line). (c) Partial emission spectra of 24 as a function of temperature and \nvacuum (?exc = 393 nm): the spectrum at 298 K was recorded at ambient pressure \n(1 bar) and the spectra at 350, 400 and 450 K were recorded with a vacuum of ca. \n5\u00d710-6 mbar. (d) Partial emission spectra of 24 and 24-dehyd with ?exc = 393 nm \n(ambient temperature - 298 K): black line, 24 at ambient pressure; red line, 24 after \ndehydration at 450 K under a vacuum of 5\u00d710-6 mbar; green line after dehydration \nat 450 K followed by rehydration over a period of one day at ambient conditions \n(temperature and pressure). Please note: the green and black lines are nearly \nperfectly overlapped. \n\n \n\n \n\nDehydration of 24 is accompanied by a boost in the emission efficiency of the \n\nmaterial with a ca. 1.7 fold increase in the integrated emission intensity (Figure 4.30d). \n\nThe ratio between the integrated intensities of the 5D0?\n7F2 and \n\n5D0?\n7F1 transitions, \n\n)()( 1\n7\n\n0\n5\n\n2\n7\n\n0\n5\n\nFDFD\nII\n\n??\n, known as the asymmetric ratio, was calculated at ca. 2.5 and 4.0 for \n\n24 and 24-dehyd, respectively. These values point to a slightly more distorted \n\nenvironment of the Eu3+ coordination polyhedron in the dehydrated material (please \n\nnote: a low value indicates a lower distortion of local environment for Eu3+, \n\napproaching to the ideal case of an inversion center). This result agrees well with the \n\ncrystallographic studies: while the release of the coordinated water molecule does not \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n176 \n \n\nimply a considerable rearrangement of the coordination polyhedron of Eu3+, it \n\nnevertheless leads to a more asymmetric environment as the bond angles to the apical \n\npositions of the pentagonal bipyramid become larger than those between the \n\nequatorially-connected atoms. \n\nThe ambient temperature (298 K) 5D0 lifetime of Eu\n3+ of 24 and 24-dehyd were \n\ndetermined by monitoring the emission decay curves within the maximum of the \n5D0?\n\n7F2 transition, using an excitation at ca. 393 nm (Figure 4.31). The decay curves \n\nwere fitted by single exponential functions, yielding lifetimes of 0.60\u00b10.01 and \n\n1.60\u00b10.01 ms for 24 and 24-dehyd, respectively. This indicates the presence of a unique \n\nEu3+ crystallographic site and clearly demonstrates the improvement of the decay time \n\n(ca. 2.7 times) with the removal of the coordinated water molecules due to the \n\nsuppression of emission quenching through the coupling of the Eu3+ excited states with \n\nthe vibrational states of the O\u2013H oscillators. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.31 - 5D0 decay curves of [(La0.95Eu0.05)2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (24) (black) \nand [(La0.95Eu0.05)(H3bmt)] (24-dehyd) (red), acquired at 298 K while monitoring \nthe emission at 611.5 and 612.1 nm, respectively. Curves were fitted by using \nsingle exponential decay functions. The excitation was performed at 393 nm. \n\n \n\n \n\nCompounds 25 and 25-dehyd have similar excitation spectra at ambient \n\ntemperature (298 K), being dominated by the broad UV band ranging from 240 to 288 \n\nnm and attributed to the ligand excited states (Figure B.3.4 in the Appendices). The \n\nTb3+ intra-4f8 transitions can be readily visualized after a magnification of the spectra. \n\nThe enhancement of the broad UV band on the Tb3+-containing compounds when \n\ncompared with the Eu3+-based materials may be explained by a more efficient energy \n\ntransfer from the ligands to the Tb3+ cations, promoted by the superposition with the \n\ninterconfigurational 4f75d1 excited states of Tb3+ in this region of the spectrum.18 The \n\n\n\n1D-3D MOFs Based on (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic Acid \n\n177 \n \n\nimpact of the dehydration process of 25 into 25-dehyd has also been studied: although \n\nin a smaller magnitude with respect to measurable effects, the emission spectra and 5D4 \n\ndecay curves recorded at 298 K yield comparable results to those discussed above for 24 \n\nand 24-dehyd (Figures B.3.5 and B.3.6 in the Appendices). \n\nBased on the emission spectra, 5D0 lifetimes and empirical radiative and non-\n\nradiative transition rates, and assuming that only non-radiative and radiative processes \n\nare involved in the depopulation of the 5D0 state, the \n5D0 quantum efficiency, q,\n\n10-13 has \n\nbeen determined for 24 and 24-dehyd. As for compound 1,  the number of water \n\nmolecules (nw) coordinated to Eu\n3+ and Tb3+ may be determined using the empirical \n\nformula of Kimura &amp; Kato,16 also in agreement with the formula of Horrocks.15 Data, \n\nincluding the absolute emission quantum yield (measured experimentally), are collected \n\nin Table 4.4 for compounds 24, 24-dehyd and 25. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4.4 - Experimental 5D0 lifetime, ?, radiative, kr, and non-radiative, knr, transition rates, \n5D0 quantum \n\nefficiency, q, absolute emission quantum yield, ?, and the estimated number of water molecules, nw, for \n[(La0.95Eu0.05)2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (24) and [(La0.95Eu0.05)(H3bmt)] (25-dehyd).

This occurs because of a relatively low \n\nnon-radiative transition rate promoted by the suppression of the O\u2013H oscillators \n\nassociated with the coordinated water molecules, and the concomitant increment of the \n\nradiative transition rate. The measured maximum absolute emission quantum yield of \n\n24 (4% at 280 nm) is, nevertheless, far from the calculated quantum efficiency \n\nindicating that part of the absorbing light into the ligand excited levels relaxes non-\n\nradiatively and not reaching the 5D0 emitting state. In contrast, compound 25 reaches a \n\nrelatively high absolute emission quantum yield (46% at 280 nm excitation). The high \n\nabsolute emission quantum yield observed for 25 must then be interpreted by a good \n\nbalance between absorption, energy transfer and emission rates. Note that, as the \n\ndehydrated materials readily rehydrate at normal ambient conditions it was not possible \n\nto measure their corresponding absolute emission quantum yields. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n178 \n \n\n4.4.6. Heterogeneous catalysis \n\n \n\nThe catalytic performance of [La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (20) was investigated in \n\nthe ring-opening reaction of styrene oxide (PhEtO) with methanol at 55 \u00baC (see Scheme \n\n3.1 in Chapter 3). The only reaction product is 2-methoxy-2-phenylethanol \n\n(MeOPhEtOH), which was formed in 80% yield after 24 h of reaction. Noteworthy, in \n\nthe absence of the heterogeneous catalyst (but under similar reaction conditions) the \n\nconversion at 24 h was only ca. 10%. These results clearly show that 20 exhibits \n\nactivity and excellent regioselectivity in the methanolysis of PhEtO to the ?-alkoxy \n\nalcohol product.  \n\nFor comparative purposes the PBUs (organic linker and the lanthanide \n\nprecursor) were also tested under similar reaction conditions as (homogeneous) catalysts \n\n(using amounts equivalent to those in the loaded MOF catalyst) in the methanolysis of \n\nPhEtO. In the case of the ligand H6bmt, MeOPhEtOH was formed in quantitative yields \n\nwithin 1 h of reaction, indicating that the organic PBU is a highly active and selective \n\nhomogeneous Br\u00f6nsted acid organocatalyst (Table 4.5). When the lanthanide precursor \n\n(LaCl3\u00b77H2O) was employed as the catalyst, MeOPhEtOH was produced in 71% yield \n\nat 24 h reaction (93% selectivity). \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4.5 - Ring-opening reaction of styrene oxide with methanol at 55 \u00baC..\na\n \n\nCatalyst \nReaction Time \n\n(h) \n\nConversion \nb\n \n\n(%) \n\nSelectivity \nc\n \n\n(%) \n\nnone 24 10 100 \n\nH6bmt 1 100 100 \n\nLaCl3\u00b77H2O 4 / 24 27 / 71 93 / 93 \n\n20 4 / 24 10 / 80 100 \na Reaction conditions: PhEtO (0.41 mmol), catalyst (20 mg), alcohol (1 mL). \nb Conversion of PhEtO. \nc Selectivity to MeOPhEtOH. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe recyclability of the catalyst 20 was investigated for three consecutive batch \n\nruns in the reaction of PhEtO with methanol at 55 \u00baC.

In all runs MeOPhEtOH was always the only \n\nreaction product and no decrease in catalytic activity was observed (Figure 4.32). On \n\nthe contrary, it was observed an increase in the reaction rate from the first to subsequent \n\nruns, most likely due to an increase in the number of effective active sites.

Results and Discussion \n\n \n\nThe self-assembly between the tripodal organic ligand H6bmt and lanthanide \n\ncations, with the exception of lutetium, successfully produced three different families of \n\nmultidimentional MOFs: \n\ni) 1D [Ln(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O materials [where Ln\n3+ = La3+ (9), \n\n(La0.97Eu0.03)\n3+ (10) and (La0.97Tb0.03)\n\n3+ (11)];  \n\n\n\n1D-3D MOFs Based on (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic Acid \n\n181 \n \n\nii) 2D layered [Ln2(H3bmt)2]\u00b7H2O materials [where Ln\n3+ = Eu3+ (12), Gd3+ (13), \n\nTb3+ (14), Dy3+ (15), Ho3+ (16), Er3+ (17), Tm3+ (18) and Yb3+ (19)]; \n\niii) 3D [Ln2(H3dmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O materials [where Ln\n3+ = La3+ (20), Ce3+ (21), \n\nPr3+ (22), Nd3+ (23), (La0.95Eu0.05)\n3+ (24) and (La0.95Tb0.05)\n\n3+ (25)].  \n\nThe crystalline structure of all compounds were unveiled by single-crystal or \n\npowder X-ray diffraction studies, and bulk materials were fully characterized using \n\nstandard solid-state techniques (FT-IR, electron microscopy, solid-state NMR, \n\nthermogravimetric and elemental analysis). \n\nConventional hydrothermal synthesis (180 \u00baC for 72 h) was found to be an \n\nefficient synthetic approach for the isolation of the 2D and 3D families of materials as \n\nmicrocrystalline powders or large single-crystals, respectively. It was discovered that \n\ntemperatures as low as 100 \u00baC also seem to lead to the isolation of the 3D MOFs, with \n\nlarge particle size and in periods of time varying between 1 and 3 days. The MWAS \n\napproach was ideal to isolate isotypical 1D compounds at mild reaction conditions (40 \n\n\u00baC for 5 minutes). Remarkably, under microwave irradiation, compound 20 could also \n\nbe prepared. Nevertheless, in this situation the employed temperature was found to be a \n\ncrucial parameter in the self-assembly process: for 5 minutes of reaction time, phase-\n\npure materials can only be isolated for temperatures greater than 150 \u00baC. These results \n\nclearly indicate that by systematically investigating the synthesis of these isotypical \n\nsystems of LnOFs it might be possible to derive optimal conditions to isolate them in \n\nthe shortest possible period of time. Moreover, and based on investigations in the use of \n\nmicrowave irradiation performed by the MOF research group at the University of \n\nAveiro,19 it might even be possible to either control the crystal morphology or size, or \n\neven both, or even find new functional materials. The studies led to the conclusion that \n\nthese materials can indeed be isolated under very mild conditions, with this fact clearly \n\nconstituting an attractive option for eventual large-scale preparations (reduced energy \n\nconsumption and operation costs). \n\nFrom single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies, it was found that \n\n[Ln2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O materials are 3D MOFs, built-up on a single \n\ncrystallographically independent lanthanide center, trapping solvent water molecules \n\n(both of crystallization and coordinated to the lanthanide center). As expected, the \n\nanionic H3bmt\n3- linker was found to be a rather robust organic PBU, leading to materials \n\nwhich exhibit a typical zeolitic behaviour: by heating or applying a high vacuum, all \n\nwater molecules could be reversibly removed from the structures; this process was \n\nshown to occur without loss of crystallinity or considerable structural modifications. \n\nThese features are supported by VTXRD studies, which showed that the release of both \n\ncoordinated and uncoordinated water molecules only induces very small modifications \n\nin the crystal structure of the [Ln2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O materials. The dehydrated form \n\nof these compounds maintains the stability and thermal robustness up to around 400 \u00baC. \n\nA drastic different behaviour was described for the 1D \n\n[Ln(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O materials that exhibited comparatively very poor \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n182 \n \n\nthermal stability. The release of the five water molecules (two coordinated and three of \n\ncrystallization) promotes structural modifications. Although not completely solved at \n\nthis stage, the structure of the 2D layered [Ln2(H3bmt)2]\u00b7H2O materials showed \n\nremarkable thermal stability up to ca. 370 \u00baC. For this family of materials, dehydration \n\ndid not lead to structural modifications. \n\nAnother interesting feature found in the [Ln2(H3bmt)2]\u00b7H2O materials is related \n\nto their particle sizes. The inclusion of lanthanide cations with higher atomic numbers \n\n(i.e., smaller ionic radii) led to a drastic reduction in the average particle size, being this \n\neffect more noticeable in the Yb3+-based compound. In the literature some reports have \n\ndescribed that the lanthanide contraction may affect the geometry and the overall \n\narchitecture of the materials.20-22 Nevertheless, to present it seems that this system \n\nconstitutes the first time for which this effect of the lanthanide contraction in the particle \n\nsize is fully described. The properties of [Ln2(H3bmt)2]\u00b7H2O materials are currently \n\nunexplored. However, as described for compound 1n (reported in Chapter 3) the \n\ndecrease of the crystal size in the materials may led to an improvement in their catalytic \n\nbehavior. \n\nThe zeolitic behaviour described for the [Ln2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O materials has \n\nimportant consequences in the observed photoluminescent properties. Firstly, the \n\nremoval of the water molecules for the Eu3+-based material leads to a concomitant \n\nincrease of the quantum efficiency from ca. 15% (for the as-prepared compound) to ca. \n\n54%. Secondly, the Tb3+ compound shows the remarkable absolute emission quantum \n\nyield of ca. 46% (at 280 nm excitation) reflecting a good balance between absorption, \n\nenergy transfer and emission rates. Similar behaviour was found for the Tb3+-based \n\nmaterial 11 showing an absolute quantum yield of 44%. Conversely, the Eu3+-based \n\nmaterial 10 has an absolute quantum yield of only 5%. \n\nThe catalytic performance of the La3+-based materials 9 and 20 were tested in \n\nthe ring-opening reaction of styrene oxide with methanol. Results suggest that: i) both \n\nmaterials act as truly heterogeneous catalysts; ii) excellent regioselectivity towards 2-\n\nmethoxy-2-phenylethanol is observed, with this compound being always the sole \n\nreaction product; iii) catalysts can be recycled by simple and efficient regeneration \n\nprocesses; iv) the activity of 20 increases with the catalytic runs without a significant \n\nloss of crystallinity or modification of the crystal structure. Noteworthy, compound 9 \n\nshowed an outstanding catalytic activity compared to 20. While 9 converts 100% of \n\nstyrene oxide in only 30 min, 20 takes 24 h to convert 80%. This remarkable activity is \n\nrelated with the active sites of 9 that are likely of Br\u00f6nsted-type (associated with its \n\norganic component). It is worth mentioning that the very active organocatalyst H6bmt \n\nligand catalyses in an homogeneous fashion, posing significant experimental drawbacks \n\nwhich can be overcomed by using the heterogeneous catalyst 9. \n\n\n\n1D-3D MOFs Based on (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic Acid \n\n183 \n \n\n4.6.

Initial Considerations \n\n \n\nAlthough not very common, perfluorinated or partially fluorinated organic linkers \n\nin which the hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine or ?CF3 groups have already been \n\nused in the preparation of functional MOFs.1-9 Compared with non-fluorinated, fluorinated \n\nMOFs have shown to enhance the hydrophobicity, increase structural stability in water or \n\nmoisture atmospheres, and even to improve the photoluminescent properties.7,10-11 \n\nAdditionally, the presence of fluorine atoms as constituent of the organic molecules may \n\nlead to the formation of F\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7F interactions, helping in the stabilization of the resulting \n\nnetworks.5,12 \n\nFully or partially fluorinated MOFs have been studied, mainly, as potential \n\nmaterials for application in adsorption processes,3,8-9 and luminescent devices.13-14 The \n\nresearch group of Omary reported the synthesis of totally fluorinated MOFs, coined as \n\nFMOF-1 and FMOF-2, from the combination of Ag+ with 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-1,2,4-\n\ntriazolate.10,15-16 The hydrophobic character of FMOF-1 is the main responsible for the \n\nobserved efficient selective adsorption ability of aliphatic and aromatic oil components \n\n(benzene, toluene, p-xylene, cyclohexane and n-hexane), while preventing the entrance of \n\nwater molecules in their pores. In 2006 Chen et al. isolated two Er3+-organic frameworks, \n\n[Er2(bdc)3(DMF)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O and [Er2(bdc-F4)3(DMF)(H2O)]\u00b7DMF, by using the organic \n\nlinkers 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (H2bdc) and its fluorinated analogue 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-\n\n1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (H2bdc-F4), respectively.\n14 In this comparative study the authors \n\nshowed that the replacement of the C-H fluorescence quencher by C-F groups improves \n\nsignificantly (approximately three times) the near-infrared luminescence properties. \n\nNoteworthy, the use of fluorinated organic molecules does not, however, ensure just by \n\nitself an improvement in the desired properties of the resulting material. A striking \n\nexample concerns the work reported by Banerjee\u2019s group on a handful of fluorinated and \n\nnon-fluorinated MOFs. The results showed that it is difficult to evaluate the influence of \n\nthe fluorination on the H2 and CO2 adsorption.\n1-2 \n\nOptically-active lanthanide- (or mixed-lanthanide)-based compounds have found \n\npotential applications in the fabrication of sensing devices.17-19 As described in Chapters 3 \n\nand 4, the MOF research group at the University of Aveiro has been interested in the \n\npreparation of luminescent Lanthanide-Organic Frameworks (LnOFs). Following this line \n\nof research, a novel fluorinated tripodal organic ligand ((2,4,6-trifluorobenzene-1,3,5-\n\ntriyl)tris(methylene))triphosphonic acid (H6tftp) was designed and prepared in a simple \n\nthree-step reaction procedure (Scheme 2.6). This molecule is a structural analogue of \n\n(benzene-1,3,5-tryiltris(methylene)triphosphonic acid (H6bmt) whose MOF structures \n\nwere described in Chapter 2. H6tftp was self-assembled with lanthanide cations under \n\nhydrothermal conditions to produce a new family of isotypical LnOFs, formulated as \n\n[Ln(H3tftp)(H2O)] [where Ln\n3+ = La3+ (26), (La0.95Eu0.05)\n\n3+ (27), (La0.95Tb0.05)\n3+ (28).20 The \n\ncrystal structure of 26, isolated as large single-crystals, was unveiled by single-crystal X-\n\nray diffraction and consists of neutral ?\n2[La(H3tftp)(H2O)] layers. All materials were fully \n\ncharacterized by standard solid-state techniques (powder X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, electron \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n188 \n \n\nmicroscopy (SEM and EDS), solid-state NMR, thermogravimetric and elemental analysis). \n\nThe photoluminescent properties of the compounds 27 and 28 were investigated. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2. Strategy \n\n \n\nThe presence of O-H, C-H and/or N-H groups (usually belonging to solvents \n\nmolecules, such as water and the most common organic solvents, or organic linkers) in the \n\nclose proximity of lanthanide centers quench their photoluminescence properties through \n\nnon-radiative processes.14,21-23 An alternative option to circumvent this limitation would be \n\nto suppress the presence of such oscillator groups. Reduction/elimination of the quenching \n\neffect can also be achieved from the deuteration of O-H (as described in Chapter 3) and C-\n\nH groups, or by replacing C-H for C-F bonds in the organic molecules. Having in mind this \n\nidea, the trifluorinated H6tftp organic molecule was designed and prepared.  \n\nDue to the structure similarity between H6tftp and H6bmt it is aimed at the \n\npreparation of MOFs sharing the same crystalline structure of the 1D, 2D or 3D \n\ncompounds reported in Chapter 4. It is also suggested a comparative study of the \n\nphotoluminescent properties between the optically-active MOF materials isolated by using \n\nH6tftp and H6bmt. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3. Synthesis \n\n \n\n5.3.1. Hydrothermal Synthesis of isotypical [Ln(H3tftp)(H2O] materials \n\n \n\nThe self-assembly between the new tripodal organic ligand H6tftp and lanthanide \n\n(III) chloride hydrates, under hydrothermal conditions (180 \u00baC for 72 h), afforded a new \n\nfamily of MOF structures composed of three isotypical materials formulated as \n\n[Ln(H3tftp)(H2O)] [where Ln\n3+ = La3+ (26), (La0.95Eu0.05)\n\n3+ (27) and (La0.95Tb0.05)\n3+ (28)] \n\n(see sub-section 8.12.1 in the Experimental Section for further details). Compound 26 was \n\nthe only one that could be isolated with suitable particle size to be investigated by single-\n\ncrystal X-ray diffraction. Phase identification of the mixed-lanthanide materials 27 and 28 \n\nas microcrystalline powders was performed using powder X-ray diffraction. \n\nFigure 5.1 shows the PXRD patterns and SEM images of all materials. PXRD \n\npatterns indicate that compounds are crystalline and share the same crystalline phase. \n\nConcerning morphology it is clear that all compounds have the same crystal habit based on \n\nblock-like crystals. A notable feature stands out: compound 26 possesses crystalline block-\n\nlike particles with sizes in the tens of micrometers; the inclusion of 5% of Eu3+ or Tb3+ \n\nleads to a reduction of the average particle size of 27 and 28, with this feature being \n\nsignificantly more evident in the latter material. \n\n \n\n\n\nLayered MOF Based on ((2,4,6-Trifluoro-1,3,5-triyl)tris-(methylene)triphosphonic Acid \n\n189 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1 - PXRD patterns and SEM images of compounds 26, 27 and 28 prepared \n(under hydrothermal conditions) at 180 \u00baC for 72 h. \n\n \n\n \n\nIn addition, the use of stoichiometric amounts of different lanthanides in the initial \n\nreactive mixtures leads to isotypical materials having a random distribution of the metallic \n\ncenters throughout the framework. This evidence is supported from EDS mapping studies \n\nfor the mixed-lanthanide materials 27 and 28 (Figures 5.2 and 5.3). \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n190 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2 - Electron microscopy EDS mapping studies of a portion of the mixed-\nlanthanide material [(La0.95Eu0.05)(H3tftp)(H2O)] (27). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3 - Electron microscopy EDS mapping studies of a portion of the mixed-\nlanthanide material [(La0.95Tb0.05)(H3tftp)(H2O)] (28). \n\n\n\nLayered MOF Based on ((2,4,6-Trifluoro-1,3,5-triyl)tris-(methylene)triphosphonic Acid \n\n191 \n \n\n5.3.2. Isolation of large single-crystals of isotypical [Ln(H3tftp)(H2O] \n\nmaterials \n\n \n\nThe procedure to isolate compound 26 as large single-crystals is similar to that \n\ndescribed in the previous sub-section with slight modifications. Reactive mixtures \n\ncomposed of the new tripodal organic ligand H6tftp and LaCl3\u00b77H2O in distilled water \n\nwere prepared. A few drops of an aqueous solution of HCl (6 M) were added. The reaction \n\nmixture was kept at 180 \u00baC during 72 h (see dedicated Experimental Section for further \n\ndetails). \n\n The isolated material was characterized by PXRD, unequivocally confirming that \n\nthis material share the same crystalline phase with compound 26, and electron microscopy. \n\nFigure 5.4 shows a SEM image of compound 26 evidencing the presence of large single \n\ncrystals. The addition of some drops of HCl (6 M) led to a substantial increase (from \n\napproximately 20 to ca. 100 \u00b5m) of the particle size of 26. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4 - SEM image of compound 26 prepared from a reactive mixture to which a \nfew drops of an aqueous solution of HCl (6 M) were added. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.4. Crystal Structure Description of [La(H3tftp)(H2O)] \n\n \n\nThe self-assembly between the tripodal trifluorinated H6tftp organic ligand and \n\nLaCl3\u00b77H2O under hydrothermal conditions produced compound [La(H3tftp)(H2O)] (26). \n\nLarge crystals were directly harvested from the reaction vessels and studied by single-\n\ncrystal X-ray diffraction. Compound 26 crystallizes in the centrosymmetric triclinic P? \n\nspace group (see sub-section 8.12.1 in the Experimental Section for further details). The \n\nasymmetric unit is composed of two La3+ metal centers, two whole (H3tftp)\n3- residues and \n\ntwo coordinated water molecules.  \n\nThe two crystallographically independent La3+ metal centers are heptacoordinated, \n\n{LaO7}, to one water molecule and six independent phosphonate groups from four H3tftp\n3- \n\nresidues. All phosphonate groups bear an uncoordinated ?OH moiety with the two other \n\noxygen atoms being connected to La3+ metal centers in a typical \u00b52-O,O\u2019 bridging mode. \n\nThe La\u2013O bond lengths to phosphonate groups range from 2.361(6) to 2.595(7) \u00c5 and the \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n192 \n \n\nLa\u2013Owater distances are 2.591(6) and 2.593(6) \u00c5. The O\u2013La\u2013O angles composing the \n\ncoordination spheres were found in the 73.3(2)-161.5(2)\u00ba range (see Figure 5.5 and Table \n\nC.1.1 in the Appendices for additional geometrical details). The overall coordination \n\nenvironment of the metal centers resembles a monocapped trigonal prism, with the trigonal \n\nand quadrangular internal angles found in the 43.4(2)-91.7(3)\u00ba and 76.7(2)-100.6(2)\u00ba \n\nranges, respectively (Fig. 2). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5 - Polyhedral representation of the {LaO7} distorted monocapped trigonal \nprismatic coordination environments of the two crystallographic independent La3+ \ncenters present in 26: (a) La1 and (b) La2. For selected bond lengths and angles see \nTable C.1.1 in the Appendices. \n\n \n\n \n\nAs shown in Figure 5.6 the crystallographically independent pairs of metal centers \n\nand organic residues are highly superimposable. Moreover, the calculated root mean \n\nsquares (rms) of 0.005 and 0.04 \u00c5 for the coordination spheres of the lanthanum atoms and \n\nthe organic residues, respectively, are comparable with the experimental error of the \n\natomic positions (for instance, the average C\u2013C bond precision is 0.0133 \u00c5). This fact \n\ncould, in principle, indicate problems in the determination of cell parameters and/or the \n\nspace group of compound 26. Nevertheless attempts to find better cell parameters or space \n\ngroups always produced the crystallographic data displayed in the sub-section 8.12.1 (in \n\nthe Experimental Section) as the best choice. Additionally, the presence of six 31P \n\nresonances in the solid-state NMR spectrum of 26, and the existence of nine Stark \n\ncomponents in the 5D0?\n7F2 transition at 14 K (see dedicated sections for further details) \n\nfor the isotypical compound 27, agree well with the current proposal for the structural \n\nmodel of this series of materials. \n\nThe combination between the H3tftp\n3- organic residues and La3+ metal centers \n\noriginates a two-dimensional ?\n2[La(H3tftp)(H2O)] neutral coordination polymer placed on \n\nthe ac lattice plane of the unit cell (Figure 5.7). Despite the hydrophobic aromatic rings of \n\nH3tftp\n3- being located in the walls of the polymeric layers, they are not engaged in ?-? \n\nstacking interactions. Weak supramolecular F\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7F interactions are present within the \n\nhydrophobic wall (see legend of Figure 5.7 for additional details), with all C\u2013F\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7F angles \n\nbeing comprised in the 139.6(6)-142.0(6)\u00ba range. The similarity between these values and \n\n\n\nLayered MOF Based on ((2,4,6-Trifluoro-1,3,5-triyl)tris-(methylene)triphosphonic Acid \n\n193 \n \n\ntheir interaction angle allows to classify unequivocally these interactions as of type I, \n\nultimately considering them as of weak nature. Indeed, for the F\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7F interactions being \n\nconsidered strong (type II), the C\u2013F\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7F angles should be markedly distinct with values of \n\napproximately 90 and 180\u00ba.24 Instead, the fluorine atoms are engaged in intramolecular C\u2013\n\nH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7F interactions (not shown). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.6 - Structure overlay of the (a) two coordination environments around the \nLa3+ metallic centres, La1 in blue and La2 in pink, and of the (b) two crystallographic \nindependent residues of H6tftp (H3tftp\n\n3-).

Symmetry codes used to generate equivalent atoms have been omitted for \nclarity. For geometrical details on the represented hydrogen bonds see Table C.1.2 in \nthe Appendices. \n\n\n\nLayered MOF Based on ((2,4,6-Trifluoro-1,3,5-triyl)tris-(methylene)triphosphonic Acid \n\n195 \n \n\nAll phosphonate groups point to the interlamellar space forming a lanthanum oxide \n\nlayer and an intricate hydrogen bond network as depicted in Figure 5.8. All oxygen atoms \n\nof this network are located within a layer with thickness of ca. 1.8 \u00c5, also parallel to the ac \n\nlattice plane. Two pairs of rings with graph set motifs R22(6) and R\n2\n2(8) are the most \n\nremarkable features of this network. The R22(8) set motifs are formed by two \n\nhydrogenophosphonate groups (with O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O distances ranging from 2.568(9) to 2.692(9) \u00c5 \n\nand O?H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O interaction angles between ca. 153 and 161\u00ba). The R22(6) graph set motifs \n\ncomprise one hydrogenophosphonate group and one water molecule (with internuclear \n\nO\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O distances ranging from 3.109(8) to 3.154(9) \u00c5 and O?H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O interaction angles \n\nbetween 113 and 143\u00ba; for further geometrical details see Table C.1.3 in the Appendices). \n\nThe most significant packing forces between layers are weak van der Waals interactions. \n\nThis structural feature can be related with the low crystal robustness of 26 and further \n\nexplains the great difficulty of finding suitable single-crystals for X-ray diffraction studies. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.5. Thermogravimetry and Variable Temperature Powder X-ray \n\nDiffraction Studies \n \n\nThe thermal stability of the isotypical materials 26, 27 and 28 was investigated \n\nbetween ambient temperature and ca. 800 \u00baC. The thermograms of the three materials \n\nexhibit slight different profiles (Figure C.1.1 in the Appendices), with this fact being \n\nattributed to the decrease of the average particle size of compounds 27 and 28 (see SEM \n\nimages in Figure 5.1): materials with smaller average particle size are expected to have a \n\nhigher surface area, being ultimately thermally less stable, hence leading to distinct overall \n\nthermal behaviors. The decomposition behavior of 27 and 28 start at lower temperatures \n\nthan that registered for 26. This is more evident for compound 28 (corresponding to the \n\nsmallest average particle size). In spite of these differences the thermal decomposition of \n\nmaterials 26-28 occurs in a rather similar fashion as depicted in Figure C.1.1 (in the \n\nAppendices).  \n\nIn order to understand the temperature effect in the crystal structure itself, \n\nVTPRXD studies on bulk 26 were performed between ca. 30 to 700 \u00baC. Compound 26 is \n\nthermally stable from ambient temperature to approximately 200 \u00baC. In this temperature \n\nrange no weight loss is observed (Figure 5.9 \u2013 bottom left), with the crystal structure \n\nremaining intact (Figure 5.9 \u2013 top right). The first weight loss occurs between ca. 207 and \n\n357 \u00baC, being attributed to the release of the coordinated water molecules and the \n\nbeginning of the material deterioration. As observed from the VTPRXD patterns a \n\ndramatic loss of crystallinity occurs during the first weight loss. After this temperature, \n\nseveral weight losses are observed leading to the formation of an amorphous residue at \n\napproximately 450 \u00baC. At ca. 700 \u00baC a residue composed of a mixture of lanthanum \n\ncatenatriphosphate (LaP3O9, ICDD 00-033-0717) and monazite (LaPO4, ICDD 01-071-\n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n196 \n \n\n6745) was identified by powder X-ray diffraction studies (PDF4+ 2012 release ICDD \n\ndatabase). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.9 - Thermogram and VTPXRD studies for compound [La(H3tftp)(H2O)] \n(26).  \n\n \n\n \n\n5.6. Solid-State NMR and FT-IR Spectroscopic Studies \n\n \n\nTo gain more insight on the composition of the asymmetric unit and phase purity of \n\nthe bulk materials, solid-state NMR studies were performed on bulk material 26 containing \n\nthe La3+ diamagnetic metallic center. The 31P MAS spectrum exhibits, in the isotropic \n\nregion, two well-resolved resonances. After deconvolution, six peaks centered at ca. 8.4, \n\n9.6, 10.6, 11.8, 16.9 and 17.0 ppm were found (Figure 5.10), agreeing well with the \n\npresence of six crystallographic distinct phosphorus sites. Peak deconvolution and \n\nintegration, including the spinning sidebands, provides a ratio of ca. 1.00 : 1.00 : 1.00 : \n\n1.00 : 1.00 : 1.00.   \n\n\n\nLayered MOF Based on ((2,4,6-Trifluoro-1,3,5-triyl)tris-(methylene)triphosphonic Acid \n\n197 \n \n\nThe 13C{1H} CP MAS spectrum (Figure C.1.2 in the Appendices) contains three \n\ndistinct spectral regions: the \u2013CH2? groups appear as a broad peak centered at ca. 23.2 \n\nppm; the aromatic C\u2013C and C\u2013F moieties appear in the 100-115 ppm (peaks at ca. 106.0 \n\nand 108.6 ppm) and 150-170 ppm (peaks at ca. 156.8, 157.8, 159.3 and 160.2 ppm) \n\nspectral ranges, respectively. These data are consistent with the performed crystallographic \n\nstudies, agreeing particularly well with the presence of two organic ligands in the \n\nasymmetric unit of 26. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.10 - Experimental (black) and deconvoluted (light brown) 31P HPDEC MAS \nspectra of compound 26. Spinning sidebands are denoted using an asterisk. Peak \ndeconvolution and integration throughout the entire spectral range (i.e., including the \nspinning sidebands) gives a ratio of ca. 1.00 : 1.00 : 1.00 : 1.00 : 1.00 : 1.00 for the \nisotropic resonances peaking at ca. 8.4, 9.6, 10.6, 11.8, 16.9 and 17.0 ppm, \nrespectively. The grey lines represent the individual fits for the single resonances. \n\n \n\n \n\nFT-IR spectroscopy studies (Figure 5.11) indicate that the bulk materials 26, 27 and \n\n28 are indeed isotypical. Thus, in the following paragraphs only the spectral features for \n\ncompound 26will be discussed, being assumed that identical considerations are valid for \n\nthe remaining materials 27 and 28. \n\n The FT-IR spectrum of 26 is mainly composed of two relevant spectral regions. In \n\nthe 3750-2500 cm-1 range one can observe: (i) the typical ?(O?H) stretching vibrational \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n198 \n \n\nmodes of the coordinated water molecules (at ca. 3493 and 3446 cm-1) and of the PO?H \n\ngroups (at ca. 3213 cm-1); and (ii) a weak and sharp band observed at ca. 2941 cm-1 \n\nattributed to the ?(C?H) stretching vibration of the ?CH2? groups.  \n\nBelow 1800 cm-1 the FT-IR spectrum of 26 is complex with a large number of \n\nmedium-to-very strong vibration bands.25 At ca. 1673, 1625 and 1602 cm-1 it is possible to \n\nobserve the ?(H2O) and ?(?C=C?) in-plane deformations. The very intense peak at around \n\nca. 1470 cm-1 is attributed to a ?(?C=C?) stretching vibration mode of the aromatic ring, \n\nbeing frequently observed with the presence of electron acceptors connected to the \n\naromatic rings. Two medium intensity bands peaking at ca. 1420 and 1409 cm-1 belong to \n\nthe ?CH2? deformation vibrational modes from the P?CH2 groups. Additionally, the \n\n?(P=O) and ?(C?F) modes appear in the 1350-1050 cm-1 range, followed of a set of \n\nvibration bands between 1040 and 900 cm-1 attributed to the ?(P?O) modes. The ?(P?C) \n\nstretching vibrations are centered at ca. 763 and 745 cm-1.25 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.11 - FT-IR spectra of the isotypical series of the materials [La(H3tftp)(H2O)] \n(26), [(La0.95Eu0.05)(H3tftp)(H2O)] (27) and [(La0.95Tb0.05)(H3tftp)(H2O)] (28). \n\n\n\nLayered MOF Based on ((2,4,6-Trifluoro-1,3,5-triyl)tris-(methylene)triphosphonic Acid \n\n199 \n \n\n5.7.

The excitation spectra of 27 and 28, while \n\nmonitoring the emission at 616 and 542 nm within the Eu3+ 5D0?\n7F2 and Tb\n\n3+ 5D4?\n7F5 \n\ntransitions, respectively, are shown in Figure 5.12. Spectra are dominated by a broad UV \n\nband (240-280 nm) which may be attributed to the ?-?* transitions associated with the \n\norganic linkers. This assignment was further confirmed by monitoring the singlet UV \n\nemission at 330 nm in both the H6tftp ligand and compound 26 (Figure 5.12). The \n\nexcitation of 26 is slightly red shifted relatively to that of H6tftp and resembles the UV \n\nbroad band observed for 27 and 28. The additional sharp extra lines in the spectra of 27 \n\nand 28 were identified as the intra-4f6 transitions 7F0?\n5D1-4, \n\n5L6, \n5G2-6, \n\n5H3-7 and \n5F1-5 of \n\nEu3+, and as the intra-4f8 transitions 7F6?\n5D2-4 and \n\n5GJ of Tb\n3+. \n\n250 300 350 400 450 500 550\n\nTb\n3+\n\n7\nF\n6\n?\n\n5\nG\n\nJ\n, \n5\nD\n\n2\n, \n5\nD\n\n3\n7\nF\n6\n?\n\n5\nD\n\n4\n\nIn\nte\nn\ns\nit\ny\n (\na\n. \nu\n.)\n\n7\nF\n0\n?\n\n5\nF\nJ\n\n7\nF\n0\n?\n\n5\nH\n\nJ\n\n7\nF\n0\n?\n\n5\nD\n\n4\n\n7\nF\n0\n?\n\n5\nG\n\nJ\n\n7\nF\n0\n?\n\n5\nL\n6\n\n7\nF\n0\n?\n\n5\nD\n\n3\n\n7\nF\n0,1\n?\n\n5\nD\n\n2 7\nF\n0\n?\n\n5\nD\n\n1\n\nWavelength (nm) \n\nLigand\n\nEu\n3+\n\n \n\nFigure 5.12 - Excitation spectra of compound 27 at ambient temperature (red line) and \nat 14 K (black line), and of compound 28 at ambient temperature (green line). \nEmission was monitored at 616 and 542 nm for the Eu3+- and Tb3+-based materials, \nrespectively.

The emission spectrum of 27 shows a \n\npredominance of the 5D0?\n7F2 transition comparatively to the \n\n5D0?\n7F1. The identification \n\nof, at least, nine Stark components in this spectrum for the 5D0?\n7F2 transition at 14 K \n\n(inset in Figure 5.13) clearly indicates the presence of at least two low-symmetry Eu3+ \n\nenvironments in the crystal structure. This feature agrees well with the performed \n\ncrystallographic studies (see dedicated section for further details). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.13 - Emission spectra of 27 (red line) and 28 (green line) at ambient \ntemperature while using an excitation wavelength of 270 nm.

Both decay curves can be well fitted by single exponential functions, \n\nyielding lifetimes of 0.51\u00b10.01 and 1.26\u00b10.01 ms for 27 and 28, respectively. For distinct \n\nexcitation and/or the emission detection wavelengths identical lifetimes values were \n\nsystematically obtained. \n\n\n\nLayered MOF Based on ((2,4,6-Trifluoro-1,3,5-triyl)tris-(methylene)triphosphonic Acid \n\n201 \n \n\nConsidering the presence of the two distinct Ln3+ environments in the crystal \n\nstructures, the determination of single exponential decay curves arises as a further \n\nindication of the strong similarity between the two crystallographically independent Ln3+ \n\nsites in terms of the emission decay lifetime. Note that, based on crystallographic studies, \n\nboth Ln3+ metal centers have the same coordinated elements on the first sphere (seven \n\noxygen atoms: six belonging to six independent phosphonate groups and one belonging to \n\na water molecule) with very similar Ln\u2013O distances (see Table C.1.1 in the Appendices for \n\nfurther details). At 14 K the 5D0 decay curve of 27 has also a single exponential behaviour \n\nindependently of the excitation and emission wavelengths, yielding a lifetime of 0.56\u00b10.01 \n\nms (data not shown).

The low \n\nemission performance of the mixed-lanthanide Ln3+-based light emitters is certainly the \n\nresult of the combination of two main factors: (i) the presence of one water molecule in the \n\nfirst coordination sphere of the crystallographically independent Ln3+ cations, and (ii) an \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n202 \n \n\ninefficient ligand-to-Ln3+ energy transfer mechanism. The latter assumption is further \n\nsupported by the observation of the singlet ligand emission in the UV spectral region for \n\ncompound 27, under 270 nm excitation at ambient temperature (Figure 5.15). The UV \n\nemission broad band has a very short lifetime, less than 10 \u00b5s, which is below the range of \n\nthe used phosphorimeter. A similar UV emission band was also detected for the Tb3+-based \n\nmaterial 28 (data not shown). \n\n \n\n240 280 320 360 400\n\nS\n1\n????S\n\n0\nS\n0\n????S\n\n1\n\nN\no\nrm\n\na\nli\nz\ne\nd\n I\nn\nte\nn\ns\nit\ny\n\nWavelength (nm)\n \n\nFigure 5.15 - Excitation and emission spectra of the mixed-lanthanide material 27 \nrecorded at ambient temperature.

Results and Discussion \n\n \n\nIn this Chapter a family of new isotypical layered MOFs was reported: compounds \n\n[La(H3tftp)(H2O)] (26), [(La0.95Eu0.05)(H3tftp)(H2O)] (27) and [(La0.95Tb0.05)(H3tftp)(H2O)] \n\n(28) were prepared from the reaction between lanthanide chloride hydrated salts with the \n\nnovel organic ligand H6tftp under hydrothermal conditions. All materials were \n\ncharacterized by using in tandem several standard solid-state techniques. \n\nThe use of conventional hydrothermal synthesis with the same synthetic conditions \n\n(temperature, 180 \u00baC; time, 3 days; water as reaction medium) as for 2D and 3D LnOFs \n\n12-25 previously reported in Chapter 4, led to a distinct architecture. The two-dimensional \n\n?\n2[La(H3tftp)(H2O)] neutral coordination polymer (isolated when H6tftp was used) has a \n\ncompletely different crystalline structure than the 2D and 3D materials, prepared when the \n\nnon-fluorinated H6bmt organic ligand was employed. The 2D material \n\n\n\nLayered MOF Based on ((2,4,6-Trifluoro-1,3,5-triyl)tris-(methylene)triphosphonic Acid \n\n203 \n \n\n?\n2[La(H3tftp)(H2O)] has the hydrophobic aromatic rings pointing to the interlamellar space, \n\nand the phosphonate groups and metal centers forming an internal inorganic sheet.  \n\nRegarding to the thermal stability, the fluorinated compound 26 suffered a drastic \n\nloss of crystallinity upon release of the coordinated water molecules (from approximately \n\n200 \u00baC), contrasting with the thermal behaviors of the 2D materials 12-19 (thermally \n\nrobust up to approximately 400 \u00baC) and 3D materials 20-25 (showing very small structural \n\nmodifications after the dehydration process). The structure of the 1D materials 9-11 suffers \n\nsome structural alterations during the release of the coordinated and crystallization water \n\nmolecules, however, it remains crystalline.   \n\nAs mentioned in Chapter 1 and observed in Chapters 3 and 4, one of the major \n\nchallenges resides in the preparation of phosphonate-based MOFs with large particle sizes. \n\nFor the material described in this Chapter, the addition of small amounts of an aqueous \n\nsolution of HCl (6 M) to the reactive mixtures led to the isolation of compound 26 as large \n\nsingle-crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies.  \n\nMixed-lanthanide materials with stoichiometric amounts of optically-active \n\nlanthanides have been studied with results unequivocally showing that the presence of the \n\nO?H vibrations of the coordinated water molecules, composing the first coordination \n\nsphere, quench the photoluminescence of compounds 27 and 28. In addition, it was \n\ndemonstrated that for the materials reported in this Chapter the ligand-to-metal charge \n\ntransfer mechanism is poorly efficient, with the combination of these two factors leading to \n\nlow absolute emission quantum yields. In this way it is pertinent that future work is \n\ndevoted to investigate alternative synthetic ways to produce new LnOF materials using the \n\nnovel organic ligand H6tftp but without water molecules in the first coordination sphere of \n\nthe metallic center. In this way, it is envisaged that more efficient photoluminescent \n\nmaterials could be isolated, aiming at their use for the construction of sensing devices. \n\nBesides changing the reaction parameters (such as temperature, reaction time, solvent, \n\namong others), the present studies clearly show that future work could be focused on the \n\nuse of other heating methods such as microwave heating and one-pot reactions. These \n\napproaches could have the advantage of allowing a faster and low energy-consuming \n\nsynthetic process (two attractive features to industrial processes and for scaling up). \n\nThe materials reported in this chapter constitute the first example in which a \n\nfluorinated phosphonate organic ligand has been used for the preparation of \n\nmultidimensional MOFs with lanthanide cations. Despite of this, and based on the \n\nconclusions summarized above, the main objective of this work was not achieved: even \n\nthough the sole difference between H6tftp and H6bmt is the replacement of hydrogen of \n\nthe aromatic ring by fluorine atoms, isotypical functional MOF materials sharing the same \n\ncrystalline structure of the previously reported architectures 12-25 based on residues of \n\nH6bmt could not be isolated. In this way, the photoluminescence of the two families of \n\nmaterials could not be straightforwardly compared, and the influence of the C-F groups \n\ninstead the C-H bonds in the final properties could not be assessed. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n204 \n \n\n5.9.

Initial Considerations \n\n \n\nAs mentioned in Chapter 1, the quest for porosity in MOFs is the most required \n\nfeature from worldwide researchers. The design and synthesis of rigid, large and \n\nmultipodal O- and N-donor organic PBUs to combine with metallic centers seems to have \n\na strong influence in the porosity and architecture of the desired material. Keeping this in \n\nmind, several research groups have prepared different organic linkers with these \n\nrequirements. In this context, MOFs assembled from very large bi-, tri- or tetrapodal \n\norganic molecules in their structure, conferring them high porosity, have been reported \n\nover the years. As also described in Chapter 1, the 3D MOF materials reported until now \n\nhave pores with diameters varying from few to dozens of angstroms (IRMOF-74-XI with \n\npore diameter of 100 \u00c5)1 and world records in surface areas (e.g., NU-110 with a BET \n\nsurface area of 7140 m2g-1)1-2 when compared with other common porous materials (i.e., \n\nzeolites or active carbons). This feature in conjugation with other functionalities have \n\nconferred to this type of materials the ability to store high quantities of gases (i.e., H2 and \n\nCH4) to be used as clean energy and to retain, from mixture of gases, the non-\n\nenvironmentally friendly CO2, while retaining their crystalline structure. \n\nTo evaluate the porosity of a given MOF it is normally performed static adsorption \n\nexperiments using N2 (at 77 K), Ar (at 77 K) and CO2 (at 195 or 273 K). The obtained data \n\nallow us to have insights about some physical features of MOFs, such as: i) accessibility of \n\ngases to the framework; ii) gravimetric or volumetric adsorption capacity to retain gases; \n\niii) specific surface area; iv) adsorption enthalpies and v) network stability (i.e., permanent \n\nporosity) after evacuation of the guest solvent molecules.3 The latter feature provides \n\ninformation to know if the network collapses or preserve its crystalline integrity after the \n\nreleasing of the solvent molecules. This process is performed under vacuum at high \n\ntemperatures to include guest molecules of interest (e.g., H2, N2, CO2 or CH4). Figure 6.1 \n\ndepicts the adsorption/sorption process which may occur in a porous MOFs. The \n\nadsorption process occurs, normally, after the activation (i.e., desolvation), under heating, \n\nof the porous MOF. This procedure leads to the availability of all adsorption sites capable \n\nto adsorb the gases of interest. Then, heating the material, while passing an inert gas flux, \n\nallows the sorption process with the consequent release of the gas molecules. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1 \u2013 Representation of the adsorption/desorption process which occur in the \nporous MOFs. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n210 \n \n\nThe parameters mentioned above are determinated from the measurement of the \n\ntypical experimental adsorption isotherms using the small noble gas Ar and/or small \n\nmolecules such as N2 and CO2 (at the condensation temperature of the corresponding gas). \n\nThe adsorption of a given substance in a material is measured according to the quantity of \n\na gas adsorbed at a certain temperature in function of the gas pressure in equilibrium with \n\nthe solid material. There are different types of adsorption isotherms (Figure 6.2):3-7  \n\n \n\nFigure 6.2 \u2013 Representation of the six different types of adsorption isotherms. \nReproduced from reference 4. \n\n \n\n \n\ni) Type I: correspond to the adsorption in microporous materials (i.e., MOFs, zeolites \n\nand active carbons). The majority of the micropores are filled at low relative \n\npressures (below than 0.1); \n\nii) Type II: is related with the multilayer adsorption and reflects the statistical \n\nthickness of the N2 adsorbed by the material (typical for the adsorption of N2 on \n\nmacroporous compounds, as for instance, SiO2 and Al2O3). The monolayer \n\ncoverage is, then, followed by coverage of multilayers; \n\niii) Type III: common associated to both non-porous and microporous compounds. \n\nExistence of weak gas-solid interactions (e.g., adsorption of H2O molecules on \n\nnoble metals or carbons). The weak interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent \n\nleads to low uptake at low relative pressures and high uptake at higher relative \n\npressures; \n\niv) Type IV: associated to multilayer adsorption and pore condensation in mesoporous \n\nmaterials, as for instance silica and alumina (e.g., adsorption of N2 on MCM-41 \n\ntype material (mesostructured silica)). The presence of a hysteresis loop is very \n\n\n\nPorous Yttrium-Triphosphonate MOF \n\n211 \n \n\noften associated to the existence of mesopores. However, higher uptakes only occur \n\nat high relative pressures. \n\nv) Type V: as for the adsorption isotherm type III, this corresponds also to weak gas-\n\nsolid interactions (e.g., adsorption of H2O molecules on noble metals). It may be \n\nattributed to microporous or mesoporous materials; \n\nvi) Type VI: typical for homogeneous multilayered and non-porous adsorbents (as for \n\ninstance, adsorption of Kr on graphite).  \n\nAdsorption isotherms only provide information about the texture of the porous \n\nmaterials and their affinity to gases of interest. Nevertheless, if it is necessary to evaluate \n\nthe potential of a porous MOF for gas separation processes it is required other more \n\nadvanced studies. In the front line of this research is the group of Navarro who have \n\nprepared MOFs capable to capture nerve agents (i.e., sarin and mustard gas analogues)8-9 \n\nand harmful volatile organic compounds (benzene, ciclohexane and tiophene)10, \n\nincorporated and released the non-conventional [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2(pta)] RAPTA-C \n\nmetallodrug,11 and studied the ability of pyrazolate-based MOFs towards the separation of \n\nCO2 from binary (CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4)\n12-14 and ternary (CO2/CH4/C2H2)\n\n12 gas mixtures. \n\nThese investigations allowed to gain insights about the potential of their porous pyrazolate-\n\nbased MOFs to be used in gas separation processes, mainly, to capture CO2.  \n\nGas separation measurements are performed using two advanced methods:12 \n\ni) Pulse gas chromatographic experiments to evaluate the possible application of a \n\ngiven MOF on gas separation purification. This methodology allows to determine \n\nthe capacity of a porous MOF to retain gases into their structure. Gases having \n\nhigher affinity with the structure of a material are retained during longer periods of \n\ntime. This is a preliminary qualitative test before quantitative measurements. \n\nUsually it is used a mixture of several gases (e.g., H2, CH4, C2H2, CO2, C2H4, C2H6, \n\nC3H6 and C3H8) and an inert carrier gas (e.g., He). The experiments are carried out \n\nat different temperatures (273, 298, 303, 323 K and if necessary higher \n\ntemperatures). The resulted data consist in a chromatogram showing the retention \n\ntime of each gas (Figure 6.3); \n\nii) Gas separation breakthrough studies. This is a quantitative method and it is \n\nperformed after a first screening using the previous methodology. This approach is \n\nadequate for the bulk separation of gases. As mentioned above, it is required a \n\nbinary (e.g., CO2/CH4) or ternary (CO2/CH4/C2H2) mixture of gases using, as for \n\ninstance, He as diluting gas in order to avoid pressure drops in the column. The \n\nused experimental temperature may be the same as for pulse gas chromatographic \n\nexperiments. Gases with affinity for the structure of a porous MOF are more \n\nretained, while gases with lower affinity are rapidly released. The obtained data \n\nallow us to determine the quantity of a given gas into the structure of a porous \n\nMOF at different temperatures. Figure 6.4 depicts typical breakthrough curves. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n212 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.3 \u2013 Representation of pulse gas chromatogram curves exemplifying the gas \nseparation process according to the affinity between the porous MOF material and the \ngases of interest. The gas of the reference curve (e.g., H2) is represented in black and \nthe curves in blue, green and red correspond to the different gases using on the \nmeasurement, as for instance, CH4, C2H2 and CO2, respectively. In these experiments \nit is always used an inert carrier gas (generally He). rtn (where n = 1, 2, 3 and 4) is \nattributed to the retention time of each gas. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.4 \u2013 Example of a CO2/CH4 breakthrough experiment: because CO2 has \nmore affinity with the porous MOF material, it is retained into its structure \nduring longer periods of time than CH4, which does not interact with the \nmaterial. In these experiments the inert carrier gas (generally He) is always used. \n\n \n\n \n\nThis Chapter describes the preparation of a porous Yttrium-Organic Framework \n\nbased on a large tripodal phosphonate-organic ligand, termed as H6L. To the best of \n\nknowledge there are only three works reporting the organic ligand H6L: i) Beckmann et al. \n\nreported, for the first time, the synthesis and structural elucidation of this molecule as a \n\npotential organic PBUs to employ in supramolecular chemistry;15 ii) one year later, in \n\n2009, the research group led by Shimizu reported the preparation of a microporous \n\ninterpenetrated alkaline-earth phosphonate material, termed as \n\n[Sr2(H2L)(CH3OH)(H2O)4].\n16 This MOF material showed some affinity to CO2, however, it \n\nalso exhibited weak capacity to retain high quantity of this gas; iii) in the same year, \n\nOuellette and co-workers reported the synthesis of a 2D oxovanadium-arylphosphonate \n\nstructure, formulated as [V3O3(OH)(H3L)2]\u00b77.5H2O, being to date the first example of a \n\nmixed-valence compound having core.17 \n\n\n\nPorous Yttrium-Triphosphonate MOF \n\n213 \n \n\nH6L is an analogue of the 4,4\u2019,4\u2019\u2019-benzene-1,3,5-triyltribenzoic acid (BTB) organic \n\nlinker (Figure 6.5). The latter was employed with Zn2+ cations for the self-assembly of the \n\nwell-known highly porous MOF-177 (cage diameter of 14.4 \u00c5).18 Both H6L and BTB \n\npossess the phosphonic and carboxylic acids, respectively, located in order to confer them \n\na planar triangular geometry. The geometry of both organic linkers and the fact that they \n\nlarge and relatively rigid structure confer them good properties to be used as organic PBUs \n\nfor the preparation of 3D porous MOFs. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.5 \u2013 Molecular structure of the 4,4\u2019,4\u2019\u2019-benzene-1,3,5-triyltribenzoic acid \n(BTB) organic linker. \n\n \n\n \n\nThis chapter describes the synthesis of the family of isotypical porous MOFs, \n\nformulated as [RE(H3L)]\u00b7xH2O\u00b7yMeOH [where RE\n3+ = Y3+ (29); (Y0.95Eu0.05)\n\n3+ (30) and \n\n(Y0.95Tb0.05)\n3+ (31)] from the self-assembly of H6L with respective rare-earth cations, \n\nunder hydro(solvo)thermal conditions. The preparation of this novel materials can be \n\nperformed employing distinct synthetic methodologies: i) conventional solvothermal \n\nsynthesis; ii) slow diffusion; iii) the bench \u201cone-pot\u201d approach; and iv) ionothermal \n\nsynthesis. In addition to all these four methodologies to produce compound 29 as a \n\ncrystalline material, its preparation as large crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray \n\ndiffraction studies was only possible by using the solvothermal synthesis while adding HCl \n\n(6 M) to the reaction mixtures.  \n\nThe crystalline structure of 29 was unveiled by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and \n\nall materials were characterized by standard solid-state techniques (powder X-ray \n\ndiffraction, FT-IR, electron microscopy (SEM and EDS), thermogravimetric and elemental \n\nanalysis). The adsorption properties of the porous compound 29 were investigated. This \n\ncompound, with a specific BET surface area of 719 m2 g-1, has the ability to retain CO2 \n\n(1.89 mmol g-1) into their structure from a binary mixture of CO2/N2. This MOF can also \n\nseparate small amounts of C3H8, almost pure, from a binary C3H8/C3H6 mixture. Aiming to \n\nimprove the selective adsorption capacity of 29 towards CO2, it was prepared the ion-\n\nexchanged [Y(H3L)]\u00b7xSolvent_K (32) material. After adsorption studies, it was possible to \n\nconclude that 32 has the ability to retain CO2 into their network at higher temperatures, \n\nwhich was not observed for 29. This is probably due to the inclusion of K+ cations into the \n\nporous structure of the as-prepared material 29. Additionally, compound 32 showed to be \n\nable to separate C2H2, during a short period of time, from a ternary gas mixture composed \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n214 \n \n\nof N2/C2H2/CO2. Preliminary photoluminescent properties of compounds 30 and 31 were \n\ninvestigated. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.2. Synthesis \n\n \n\n6.2.1. Synthetic strategy \n\n \n\nAiming at the preparation of compound 29 as large single-crystals for X-ray \n\ndiffraction studies, it was tested a set of synthetic methodologies: i) conventional \n\nsolvothermal synthesis; ii) slow diffusion; iii) the bench \u201cone-pot\u201d approach; and iv) \n\nionothermal synthesis. All the four approaches employed led to 29 as a microcrystalline \n\nwhite powder. Isolation of large crystals of 29 was only achieved under solvothermal \n\nconditions while adding HCl (6 M). \n\n \n\nConventional solvothermal synthesis  \n\nA reactive mixture composed of H6L and YCl3\u00b76H2O, with an overall 1:4 \n\n(H6L:Y\n3+) molar ratio, in a mixture of H2O/MeOH (v/v 7:3) was prepared and kept at 140 \n\n\u00baC for 48 h. After reacting, the desired compound 29 was isolated as microcrystalline white \n\npowder. Figure 6.6 shows the PXRD pattern and the morphological features (small rod-like \n\nparticles with an average size of approximately 1-2 \u00b5m) of 29. The mixed rare-earth \n\nmaterials with 5% of Eu3+ (30) or 5% of Tb3+ (31) dispersed in a Y3+ matrix were prepared \n\nfollowing the same procedure for 29 while adjusting the desired amounts of the lanthanide \n\nchloride salts. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.6 \u2013 PXRD and SEM images of [Y(H3pptd)]\u00b7xH2O\u00b7yMeOH (29) isolated \nunder solvothermal conditions. \n\n\n\nPorous Yttrium-Triphosphonate MOF \n\n215 \n \n\nBecause 29 did not have large enough particle size to be studied using single-\n\ncrystal XRD, the optimization of various reaction parameters took place: \n\n- Temperature: 100, 140 and 180 \u00baC; \n\n- Heating/cooling temperature ramps: i) 1 h (from ambient temperature to 140 \u00baC) ? \n\n24 h (isothermal at 140 \u00baC) ? 48 h (cooling to 30 \u00baC); ii) 1 h (from ambient \n\ntemperature to 140 \u00baC) ? 48 h (isothermal at 14 \u00baC) ? 72 h (cooling to 30 \u00baC); iii) \n\n1 h (from ambient temperature to 140 \u00baC) ? 120 h (isothermal at 14 \u00baC) ? 96 h \n\n(cooling to 30 \u00baC);  iv) 48 h (from ambient temperature to 140 \u00baC) ? 24 h \n\n(isothermal at 14 \u00baC) ? 48 h (cooling to 30 \u00baC); and v) 24 h (from ambient \n\ntemperature to 140 \u00baC) ? 48 h (isothermal at 14 \u00baC) ? 72 h (cooling to 30 \u00baC). \n\nFigure 6.7 depicts an example of a heating/cooling temperature program used in the \n\noptimization process to isolate 29 as single-crystals; \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.7 \u2013 Schematic representation of a heating/cooling temperature program used \nin the optimization process to isolate 29 as single-crystals: a.t. means ambient \ntemperature. \n\n \n\n \n\n- Reaction time: 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 days; \n\n- Solvent: H2O, H2O/MeOH (v/v 7:3), H2O/MeOH (v/v 1:3), H2O/MeOH (v/v 1:4), \n\nH2O/MeOH (v/v 1:9), H2O/MeOH (v/v 7:3) and few drops of HF or HBF4; \n\n- Metal source: YCl3\u00b76H2O and YNO3\u00b7xH2O; \n\n- (Ligand : Metal) molar ratio: 1:2, 1:4, 1:12 (H6L:Y\n3+). \n\nAfter varying all these synthetic parameters, it was still not possible to isolate \n\ncompound 29 as large single-crystals. \n\n \n\nIonothermal  synthesis  \n\nReactive mixtures composed of H6L and YCl3\u00b76H2O were prepared in 1-butyl-3-\n\nmethylimidazolium chloride [BMIm]Cl, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride [EMIm]Cl \n\nor in a euthetic mixture containing choline chloride and urea. Besides the use of different \n\nionic liquids and a euthetic mixture, other reaction parameters were varied: i) temperature \n\n(140 and 150 \u00baC); ii) reaction time (48, 72 and 98 h); and iii) H6L:Y\n3+ molar ratio (1:2 and \n\n1:4). \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n216 \n \n\nThe ionothermal synthetic approach afforded compound 29, however, once again, \n\nas a microcrystalline white powder (Figure 6.8). Morphologically, the particle size and \n\nshape of 29 are very similar when compared to those particles obtained by \n\nhydro(solvo)thermal synthesis.  \n\n \n\n \n\nOne-pot  synthesis  \n\nAs reported in Chapter 3, one-pot synthesis has been a viable alternative to isolate \n\nMOF materials with large particle size, being known as a simple and low-energy \n\nconsumption method. Therefore, reactive mixtures containing H6L and YCl3\u00b76H2O, with \n\nan overall (H6L:Y\n3+) molar ratio of 1:4, in H2O/MeOH (v/v 7:3) or [EMIm]Cl were \n\nprepared. The resulting solution was kept under constant magnetic stirring. The reaction \n\ntime (2, 24, 48 and 72 h) and temperature (ambient temperature, 60 and 100 \u00baC) were \n\nvaried. \n\nSuch as for the previous synthetic procedure, the preparation of compound 29 as \n\nsingle-crystals was unsuccessful. Nevertheless, this method showed to be a very good \n\nalternative to isolate 29 as a microcrystalline powder, in milder reaction conditions. The \n\ndistribution of particle size is not however very homogeneous and the morphology is not \n\nregular and well-defined (Figure 6.8). Additionally, \u201cone-pot\u201d synthesis seems to be able \n\nto isolate 29 in large amounts (i.e., in the gram-scale) in a simple way under mild \n\nconditions. \n\n \n\nSlow diffusion  \n\nThis method is very slow, unattractive for industry and affords small quantities of \n\nthe desired materials. Nevertheless, slow diffusion synthesis is, probably, the best \n\nalternative to grow crystals. Some attempts were performed to isolate single-crystals of 29 \n\nusing this approach: \n\ni) an aqueous solution of YCl3\u00b76H2O was layered with other containing H6L and \n\nMeOH. The reaction occurred at ambient temperature during 20 days; \n\nii) an aqueous solution of YCl3\u00b76H2O was layered with 1-octanol; a third layer \n\ncontaining H6L and MeOH was added. The reaction was kept at ambient \n\ntemperature for 30 days; \n\niii) a solution composed of YCl3\u00b76H2O and [EMIm]Cl was layered with H2O, and then \n\nanother solution containing H6L and MeOH (third layer) was added. The reaction \n\nwas kept at ambient temperature for 20 days. \n\nWithin all these three attempts, compound 29 was again isolated as a microcrystalline \n\nwhite powder. Concerning morphology, this synthetic method afforded larger particles \n\n(with some of them reaching approximately 20 \u00b5m) with needle-like shape (Figure 6.8). \n\nUnfortunately, 29 was still not composed of crystals with enough size for single-crystal \n\nXRD studies.  \n\n\n\nPorous Yttrium-Triphosphonate MOF \n\n217 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.8 \u2013 PXRD and SEM images of compound 9 prepared by using different \nsynthetic approaches: ionothermal synthesis (black), one-pot synthesis (red) and slow \ndiffusion (blue). \n\n \n\n \n\nPreparation of compound [Y(H3L)]\u00b7xH2O\u00b7yMeOH as large single-crystals  \n\nA solution of YCl3\u00b76H2O dissolved in distillated water was added to a solution \n\ncomposed of the large tripodal organic ligand H6L and HCl (6 M) (0.25, 0.5, 1, 3 or 5 mL) \n\nin H2O/MeOH. The resulting reactive reaction mixtures were kept according to the \n\nfollowing temperature program: 48 h (from ambient temperature to 140 \u00baC), 24 h \n\n(isothermal at 140 \u00baC) and 48 h (cooling to 30 \u00baC) (see sub-section 8.13.1 in the \n\nExperimental Section for further details).  \n\nThe addition of higher amounts of HCl (6 M) to the reaction mixtures led to a \n\nconsiderable increase in the particle size of compound 29, while the crystalline structure \n\nremained intact. The exception was for the reaction where it was used 5 mL of HCl (6 M) \n\nwhich afforded a mixture of the crystalline phase of 29 with a secondary one (Figure 6.9). \n\nThis method allowed, thus, the isolation of large single-crystals (note the presence of \n\nparticles with sizes higher than 100 \u00b5m) for the desired XRD studies. Compound 29 \n\ncomprises needle-like particles which break when submitted to high vacuum during the \n\nSEM analysis. This is, probably, due to the release of the solvent molecules from the \n\ncrystalline structure.   \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n218 \n \n\n  \n\nFigure 6.9 \u2013 PXRD and SEM images of compound 29 prepared while adding different \namounts of HCl (6M): it is visible the effect of HCl (6 M) in the particle size of 29. \nHigher amounts lead to the formation of larger particles with needle-like shape. \n \n\n \n\n6.3. Crystal Structure Description of the Porous Material \n\n[Y(H3L)]\u00b7xH2O\u00b7yMeOH \n \n\n The structural details reported in this section come from a preliminary elucidation \n\nof the crystal structure of 29, with further crystallographic studies being needed, specially \n\nto investigate the behaviour of the solvent molecules in the channels. \n\n Large needle-like crystals of 29 were directly harvested from the reaction vessels. \n\nThis compound crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna21 space group. The asymmetric unit \n\nof 29 comprises a single crystallographically independent Y3+ metallic center, an organic \n\nligand moiety and several (being not exactly determined yet) solvent molecules (water and \n\nmethanol). The connection of the Y3+ metal center to six oxygen atoms, belonging all to \n\n\n\nPorous Yttrium-Triphosphonate MOF \n\n219 \n \n\nsix phosphonate groups of different organic ligands, leads to the formation of a {YO6} six-\n\ncoordinated distorted octahedra (Figure 6.10).  \n\n   \n\n \n\nFigure 6.10 \u2013 Schematic representation of the distorted {YO6} coordination \noctahedron present in the material 29: the yttrium metallic center and the oxygen \natoms composing the polyhedra are represented as lime and red spheres, respectively.   \n\n \n\n \n\n The arrangement between the phosphonate-based organic ligands and the Y3+ \n\ncations leads to the formation of a 3D structure comprising one-dimensional channels, with \n\ndistorted hexagonal geometry, running along of the [100] direction of the unit cell (Figure \n\n6.11). Because the refinement of the crystalline structure of 29 is still not completed, the \n\nsolvent molecules filling the channels of 29 are not represented. Another crystallographic \n\nfeature that stands out is the presence of 1D hydrogenophosphonate yttrium chains running \n\nalong of the [100] direction of the unit cell. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.11 \u2013 Crystal packing of the porous material 29 viewed in perspective along \nthe [100] direction of the unit cell. Solvent molecules were omitted for clarity.  \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n220 \n \n\n6.4. Thermogravimetry and Variable Temperature Powder X-ray \n\nDiffraction Studies \n \n\nThe thermal behavior of compound 29 was investigated between ambient \n\ntemperature and ca. 800 \u00baC from thermogravimetric analysis (Figure 6.12 \u2013 bottom left). \n\nAdditionally, to gain insight into the structure modifications that occur in the crystal \n\nstructure of 29, VTPXRD studies (in the 30-600 \u00baC temperature range) were also \n\nperformed (Figure 6.12 \u2013 top right). \n\nFrom the thermogravimetric curve of 29 it is possible to observe that the first \n\nweight loss occurs below ca. 100 \u00baC (precisely, between ambient temperature and ca. 82 \n\n\u00baC). This step corresponds to a weight loss of ca. 22.7% and it is attributed to the release of \n\nall the solvent molecules contained into the framework of 29. VTPXRD studies show, at \n\nca. 50 \u00baC, a structural modification in the crystalline structure of 29 due to this first weight \n\nloss process. This may be endorsed to contraction of the network of the porous material \n\nduring the release of the water and methanol molecules. Noteworthy, the new desolvated \n\nstructure is highly robust until approximately ca. 400 \u00baC being not visible any additional \n\nweight loss or structural modification. \n\nAfter ca. 376 \u00baC, two weight losses of 21.7 and 5.2% are observed. These are \n\nrelated with the decomposition of the organic components leading to a drastic loss of \n\ncrystallinity and, consequently, to the formation of an amorphous residue at ca. 560 \u00baC. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.12 \u2013 Thermogram (below left) and variable-temperature powder X-ray \ndiffraction patterns (top right) of the porous material 29. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPorous Yttrium-Triphosphonate MOF \n\n221 \n \n\n6.5. FT-IR Spectroscopy \n \n\n The FT-IR spectrum of the porous material 29 (Figure 6.13) exhibits diagnostic \n\nbands of the various structural features described above. As previously mentioned, 29 has \n\nsolvent molecules (water and methanol) of crystallization in their channel structure. The \n\nFT-IR spectrum exhibits a very broad band in the ca. 3723-2555 cm-1 spectral range, \n\nattributed to the overlap of the typical ?(H2O)cryst, ?(CH3O-H) cryst, ?(POH) and ?(-CH2-) \n\nstretching vibrational modes. \n\n Below 1800 cm-1 the FT-IR spectrum of 29 is quite complex, exhibiting a large \n\nnumber of weak-to-very strong vibrational bands attributed, mainly, to the large H6L \n\norganic ligand. Based on the literature19 the typical in-plane deformation of water \n\nmolecules appears at ca. 1632 cm-1 as a vibration band of medium intensity, followed of \n\nthree medium weak bands centred at ca. 1600, 1557 and 1503 cm-1, respectively, attributed \n\nto the ?(-C=C-) stretching vibration modes of the aromatic rings. Additionally, the typical \n\n?(P=O) stretching vibrations, with very strong intensity, are present at ca. 1144 and 1075 \n\ncm-1. At ca. 925 and 829 cm-1 the ?(P-O) vibration modes appear as bands of strong \n\nintensity. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.13 \u2013 FT-IR spectrum of the porous material 29. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n222 \n \n\n6.6. Adsorption Properties \n \n\nAs mentioned in Chapter 1, in the last years several scientific research groups have \n\ndedicated great efforts in the preparation of porous MOFs envisaging their application in \n\nthe sequestration, separation and purification of gases with industrial and environmental \n\ninterest. The selective adsorption capacity of the porous material toward some gases (CO2, \n\nC2H2, C3H8 and C3H6) was, thus, investigated. The selective adsorption of propane, \n\npropylene, acetylene and carbon dioxide over as, for instance nitrogen and methane may be \n\nrelated with some differences in their physical properties, such as kinetic diameter, \n\npolarizability (?), quadropole moment (?) and dipole moment (\u00b5).20 \n\nThe first step of these studies started with the acquisition of the conventional single \n\ncomponent adsorption isotherms in order to study the porous nature of the materials, \n\nfollowed by more complex and advanced studies such as pulse gas chromatography and \n\ngas separation breakthrough studies. \n\n \n\n6.6.1. Static adsorption experiments \n \n\nIn order to evaluate the accessibility of guest molecules into the porous framework \n\nof compound 29, the N2 at 77 K and CO2 at 195 K adsorption isotherms were collected \n\n(Figure 6.14). Both N2 and CO2 adsorption isotherms display type-I behavior, being \n\ncharacteristic of crystalline microporous materials. Material 29 possesses specific BET \n\nsurface areas of 104 and 719 m2 g-1 measured from the N2 and CO2 adsorption isotherms, \n\nrespectively.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.14 \u2013 N2 (diamond) and CO2 (circle) adsorption isotherms measured at 77 and \n195 K, respectively. The filled and empty symbols represent adsorption and \ndesorption processes, respectively.  \n\n\n\nPorous Yttrium-Triphosphonate MOF \n\n223 \n \n\nCompound 29 has much higher adsorption capacity for CO2 than for N2. This fact \n\nmay be associated with kinetic reasons, avoiding the diffusion of N2 molecules into the \n\nporous framework. At higher adsorption temperatures, in this case 195 K, the CO2 \n\nmolecules have larger kinetic energy, contrasting with the lower one to N2 at 77 K. \n\nTherefore, CO2 molecules are able to enter into the pores of the material and, \n\nconsequently, there is no diffusion limitation. As a consequence of that the adsorption \n\nvalues are more reasonable. The diffusion limitations of N2 molecules at 77 K are not an \n\nuncommon result, being typical of ultramicroporous materials with pore size &lt;0.5 nm.21-22 \n\n \n\n6.6.2. Pulse gas chromatography experiments \n\n  \n\nThe potential application of the porous material 29 in gas purification processes \n\nwas investigated. A chromatographic column was constructed and then packed with 29 \n\n(Figure 6.15). The pulse gas chromatography experiments have been performed in the 273-\n\n403 K temperature range using two different gas mixtures: i) C2H2/CO2/H2; and ii) \n\nC3H6/C3H8/H2. Each experiment consisted in the injection, at 1 bar, of the previously \n\nmentioned equimolecular gas mixtures (0.6 mL) on the home-made chromatographic \n\ncolumn, packed with the porous materials (previously activated at 423 K for 4 h), at \n\ndifferent temperatures (273-403 K). The separation gas performance has been examined by \n\nmeans of a mass spectrometer gas analysis system. During the experiments a constant inert \n\nHe flow (20 mL min-1) was used as the carrier gas. The interaction between H2 and the \n\nstudied materials is almost negligible, being used as reference value for the column dead \n\nvolume. Figure 6.16 depicts the instrumentation used to perform the gas separation \n\nmeasurements. \n\n \n\nFigure 6.15 \u2013 Picture of the home-made chromatographic column packed with the \nporous material 29 to use in the gas adsorption measurements. The glass wool is used \nto avoid the escape of 29 when the gas fluxes are flowed. \n\n \n\n \n\nPulse gas chromatograms for an equimolar mixture of C3H8/C3H6/H2 colected at \n\ndifferent temperatures using 29 show that this material can retain C3H8 and C3H6, mainly at \n\nlower temperatures (see Figure D.1.1 in the Appendices for further details). At higher \n\ntemperatures (i.e., 363 and 403 K) both C3H8 and C3H6 are retained into the structure of 29 \n\nduring short periods of time. Decreasing the experimental temperature, the tested gases are \n\nretained during longer periods of time leading to a peak enlargement of the \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n224 \n \n\nchromatograms. Nevertheless, it is well visible that C3H6 has higher affinity with the \n\nporous structure of 29, remaining retained during longer periods of time than C3H8.  \n\nRegarding the experimental measurements toward the separation process of CO2 \n\nand C2H2, the results suggest that compound 29 allows considerably interactions with both \n\ngases (see Figure D.1.2 in the Appendices for further details). It is nevertheless possible to \n\nobserve that 29 has more affinity for C2H2, being this gas retained, mainly, at lower \n\ntemperatures (e.g., 273 K) for longer periods of time than CO2 (Figure 6.17). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.16 \u2013 Schematic representation of the instrumentation used for the separation \ntests: (top) overview of the equipment composed of flux gas controllers, a gas \nchromatograph and a mass spectrometer; (bottom left) flux gas controllers for different \ngases of interest; and (bottom right) view of the home-made chromatographic column \npacked with 29 inside of the thermostated GC oven. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.17 \u2013 Pulse gas chromatograms for an equimolar mixture of CO2/C2H2/H2 \ncolected at 273 K using material 29. \n\n\n\nPorous Yttrium-Triphosphonate MOF \n\n225 \n \n\n6.6.3. Gas separation breakthrough studies \n   \n\nBreakthrough curves were measured to evaluate the performance of the porous \n\nmaterial 29 in the bulk separation of gas mixtures. These experiments were performed \n\nusing the home-made chromatographic columns described in the previous section, packed \n\nwith the porous material 29. Before flowing the desired gas mixtures the column was \n\nactivated at 423 K for approximately 4 h under a pure He flow (20 mL min?1). \n\nThe first experiment used two gas mixtures, C3H8/N2 (10 mL min\n-1 : 10 mL min-1) \n\nand C3H6/N2 (10 mL min\n-1 : 10 mL min-1), to evaluate the performance of 29 in the \n\nretention of propane and propylene at 273 and 296 K (see Figures 6.18 and D.1.3 in the \n\nAppendices). Figure 6.18 displays the C3H8/N2 and C3H6/N2 breakthrough experiments at \n\n273 K for 29. The results show that N2 is not retained into the porous network of 29, while \n\nC3H8 and C3H6 have strong interactions with the framework, being C3H6 more retained \n\n(Table 6.1). These results are in agreement with the pulse gas chromatography studies, \n\nbecame also in those experiments it is possible to observe that C3H6 has stronger \n\ninteractions with 29 than C3H8. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.18 \u2013 (left) C3H6/N2 and (right) C3H8/N2 breakthrough curves measured at 273 \nK for the porous material 29. \n\n \n\n \n\n In the second experiments, mixtures of N2 (17 mL min\n-1) and CO2 (3 mL min\n\n-1), \n\nsimulating the emission of a flue gas from a power plant, were flowed through 29, at 273 \n\nand 298 K. The obtained breakthrough curves revealed that CO2 is selectively retained \n\nwhile N2 flew through the materials (Figure 6.19). The breakthrough curve for 29, \n\nmeasured at 273 K, shows that CO2 is retained into the porous structure of this material \n\nduring 5.92 min. This result means that 1.89 mmol of CO2 is retained per gram of \n\ncompound 29. At higher temperatures (i.e., 298 K) it is observed a drastic decrease in the \n\nadsorption capacity of 29 towards CO2. All data are summarized in Table 6.1. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n226 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.19 - CO2/N2 breakthrough curves measured at (left) 273 and (right) 298 K for \nthe porous material 29. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 6.1 - Amount of propylene, propane and carbon dioxide (mmol g-1) retained \nfrom C3H6/N2, C3H8/N2 and CO2/N2 breakthrough curves measured at different \ntemperatures for the porous material 29. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA complex ternary gas mixture, CH4/CO2/C2H2 (14 mL min\n-1 : 3 mL min-1 : 3 mL \n\nmin-1), was also tested to assess, qualitatively, the interaction of these gases with \n\ncompound 29 at 273 K. From the breakthrough curves (Figure 6.20) is possible to observe \n\nthat CH4 was not retained into the framework. The interactions between CO2 and C2H2 \n\nwith the porous material 29 are very similar, being these gases more retained than CH4. \n\nBecause CO2 and C2H2 are released practically at the same time, it seems that the \n\nseparation between these two gases is not possible under the applied conditions. \n\n \n\nFigure 6.20 \u2013 CH4/CO2/C2H2 breakthrough curves measured at 273 K for the porous \nmaterial 29. \n\nAdsorbate 273 K 296 K 298 K \n\nC3H6 4.47 4.03 - \n\nC3H8 3.13 2.59 - \n\nCO2 1.89 - 0.18 \n\n\n\nPorous Yttrium-Triphosphonate MOF \n\n227 \n \n\nFinally, it was collected other breakthrough curves flowing through the compound 29 \n\na gas mixture composed of He (10 mL min-1), C3H8 (10 mL min\n-1) and C3H6 (10 mL min\n\n-1) \n\nat 273 and 297 K. He was used as diluting gas since both C3H8 and C3H6 are strong \n\ninteracting adsorbents. As expected, based in previous breakthrough experiments, C3H8 \n\nand C3H6 have strong interaction with the framework of 29. Although both gases are \n\njointly retained, C3H6 has stronger interaction with 29 (Figure 6.21). Therefore, during a \n\ncertain period of time (between 3.98 and 5.17 min) the porous material 29 is able to \n\nseparate propane from propylene which is of industrial interest. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.21 \u2013 C3H6/C3H8/He breakthrough curves measured at 273 (left) and 297 K \n(right) for the porous material 29. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.6.4. Preparation and adsorption properties of the ion-exchanged \n\n[KxY(H3-xL)]\u00b7ySolvent \n\n \n\nIn order to improve the adsorption properties of the porous material 29, mainly in \n\nthe retention of CO2, several ion-exchange experiments were performed. Ethanolic \n\nsolutions of KOH (0.5, 0.25, 0.05 and 0.025 M) were prepared. After optimization, it was \n\nfound that the best conditions for the ion-exchange reaction consisted in the use of more \n\ndiluted solutions of KOH, once the more concentrated ones afford amorphous or poorly \n\ncrystalline materials. Therefore, reaction mixtures containing 0.025 g of 29, KOH (0.05 M) \n\nin 5 mL of ethanol was prepared and then, ultrasonicated for approximately 5 min. The \n\nresulting suspension was stirred at ambient temperature during 24 h. After that, the final \n\ncompound, formulated as [KxY(H3-xL)]\u00b7ySolvent (32) was recovered by vacuum filtration \n\nand air-dried at ambient temperature. \n\nAfter characterization by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), it was observed that \n\nmaterial 32 has a different PXRD pattern than the starting material 29 (Figure 6.22). These \n\ndifferences may be, probably, related with some distortion in the framework of 29 \n\npromoted by the inclusion of K+. Because the ion-exchanged material 32 was isolated as \n\npowders, its crystalline structure remains unknown. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n228 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.22 - PXRD patterns of the as-prepared material 29 and of the ion-exchanged \nmaterial 32. \n\n \n  \nGas separation breakthrough studies \n\nPreliminary adsorption tests were performed for the ion-exchanged material 32. \n\nMeasurements were very similar to those for material 29: a chromatographic column was \n\npacked with 32, being then activated at 443 K for approximately 4 h under a pure He flow \n\n(20 mL min?1). \n\nThe performance of 32 in the bulk separation of a mixture of gases was evaluated. \n\nA mixture composed of N2 (17 mL min\n-1) and CO2 (3 mL min\n\n-1) was flowed through \n\nmaterial 32 at 273, 297 and 323 K (Figure 6.23). Results show that, as expected, N2 is not \n\nretained in the column. However, different behavior is visible for CO2 which interacts \n\nstrongly with 32. Although the amount of carbon dioxide (1.53 mmol g-1) retained at 273 K \n\nis lower than that observed, under the same conditions, for 29 (1.89 mmol g-1), at higher \n\ntemperatures (297 and 323 K) compound 32 is capable to adsorb larger amounts of this gas \n\n(Table 6.2). This improvement is, probably, related with the presence of K+ cations in the \n\nframework of the 32. \n\n \n \n\nTable 6.2 - Comparison of the amount of CO2 (mmol g\n-1) retained in dynamic \n\nconditions from the CO2/N2 breakthrough experiments at different temperatures for \nmaterial 29 and 32. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMaterial 273 K 297 K 323 K \n\n29 1.89 0.18 - \n\n32 1.53 0.82 0.33 \n\n\n\nPorous Yttrium-Triphosphonate MOF \n\n229 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.23 \u2013 N2/CO2 breakthrough curves measured at (bottom) 273, (middle) 297 \nand (top) 323 K for porous material 32. \n\n \n\n \nThe last measurement was based on the use a complex ternary gas mixture containing N2 \n\n(14 mL min-1), CO2 (3 mL min\n-1) and C2H2 (3 mL min\n\n-1), at 273 K, in order to evaluate, \n\nqualitatively, the interaction of material 32 with the last two gases.

Stability Studies under Constant CO2 Flow  \n \n\n In this section it will be described the stability and robustness of the porous material \n\n29, after desolvation, under a constant CO2 flow measured at different temperatures and \n\nflow pressures. \n\nCompound 29 was packed in a quartz capillary (? = 0.5 mm) and placed in a home-\n\nmade sample holder (Figure 6.25). A constant He flow was passed through the material \n\nwhile heated from 303 to 375 K (heating ramp of 6 K/h). The latter temperature was kept \n\nfor 1h30min (while using a constant He flow) to achieve the complete desolvation of 29. \n\nAfter dehydration, the temperature was cooled down to 303 K (cooling ramp of 2 K/h) and \n\nthe gas flux was replaced from He to CO2. After stabilization the flux of CO2 (during \n\napproximately 45 min), the pressure was increased for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 bar, remaining \n\nconstant for 25 min at each pressure level. Then, the CO2 flow pressure was allowed to \n\ndecrease to 1 bar and the temperature cooled down to 273 K (cooling ramp of 2 K/h). The \n\nCO2 flow pressure was manipulated in a quite similar way to that used for the \n\nmeasurements performed at 303 K. Finally, the desolvated form of 29 was maintained at \n\n273 K, under a small and constant CO2 flow for approximately 8 h. In all the experience \n\nsteps, powder X-ray diffraction patterns were collected with intervals of 5 s. All these \n\ninvestigations were performed in the beamline ID11 of the European Synchrotron \n\nRadiation Facility (ESRF) (Grenoble, France).  \n\n \n\n\n\nPorous Yttrium-Triphosphonate MOF \n\n231 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.25 - Schematic representation of the instrumentation used for the high-\nresolution powder X-ray diffraction studies. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe stability and robustness of the porous material 29 regarding its desolvation \n\nprocess and exposure to a constant CO2 flow was studied by high-resolution synchrotron \n\npowder X-ray diffraction. Studies started, as mentioned above, with the desolvation of 29 \n\nusing a constant He flow while increasing the temperature from 303 to 375 K. During this \n\nprocess it was observed a structural modification promoted by the release of the solvent \n\nmolecules. The new phase remained stable for a long period of time and it seems to be \n\nmore crystalline than the original one (Figure 6.26).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.26 - PXRD patterns collected (? = 0.2954 nm) after dehydration process of \nthe porous material 29. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n232 \n \n\nAfter the desolvation step, the experimental temperature was decreased to 303 K. \n\nFigure 6.27 shows a small decrease in the crystallinity of the studied material (mainly \n\nobserved in the first peak) during the cooling process, however, the crystalline structure \n\nremains the same. The flow of He was replaced for CO2 in order to evaluate if the \n\naccommodation of this gas induces some structural modification in the desolvated form of \n\n29. Therefore, these measurements were initialized by allowing the passage of a small CO2 \n\nflow through the capillary containing the material. Pressure was increased for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \n\nbar and, finally, decreased for 1 bar. Despite some variation in the crystallinity of the \n\nmaterial, promoted by the variation of the pressure, its structure remained robust and stable \n\n(Figure 6.28). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.27 - PXRD patterns of the desolvated form of 29 collected (? = 0.2954 nm) \nwhen the experimental temperature was decreased from 375 to 303 K. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.28 - PXRD patterns collected (? = 0.2954 nm) for the desolvated form of \n29 at 303 K by using different CO2 flow pressures.

The effect of different pressures in the desolvated material 29 it \n\nwas evaluated at that temperature. As describe above for the measurements performed at \n\n303 K the structure of the material does not suffer any modification (Figure 6.30). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.29 - PXRD patterns of the desolvated material 29 collected (? = 0.2954 nm) \nwhen the experimental temperature was decreased from 303 to 273 K. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.30 - PXRD patterns collected (? = 0.2954 nm) for the desolvated material \n29 at 273 K by using different CO2 flow pressures.

Photoluminescence Studies \n \n\nThe photoluminescent properties of the mixed-rare earths materials 30 and 31 were \n\ninvestigated. The excitation spectra of the both compounds (at ambient pressure and under \n\na vacuum of ca. 10-5 mbar) were recorded while monitoring within the strongest Eu3+ \n5D0?\n\n7F2 and Tb\n3+ 5D4?\n\n7F5 emission transitions, respectively (Figure 6.31). The spectra \n\nare dominated by a broad UV band composed by two main components attributable to the \n\nexcited states of the organic ligand moieties. This attribution was confirmed recording the \n\nexcitation spectra of 30 (under vacuum, Figure 6.31) monitoring their fluorescence \n\nemission at 385 nm (discussed below). The typical intra-4f6 and 4f8 transitions of Eu3+ and \n\nTb3+, respectively, cannot be properly recognized on the corresponding excitation \n\nspectrum, indicating an efficient sensitization of Eu3+ and Tb3+, via the excited states of the \n\nligand comparatively to their direct excitation. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.31 - Excitation spectra of 31 (?Em. = 549.5 nm, green) and 30 (?Em. = 609.3 \nnm, black) at ambient pressure and under vacuum (?Em. = 611.4 nm, red; ?Em. = 385, \npurple) while monitoring the emission of the Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions, and of the ligand, \nrespectively. The spectra have been recorded at ambient temperature (solid lines) and \nat 12 K (dotted lines). \n\n \n\n \n\nThe emission spectra of 30 and 31, recorded at ambient conditions (297 K) and \n\nwith excitation at 320 nm, are provided in Figure 6.32. The sharp emission lines of 30 and \n\n31 are assigned to the 5D0?\n7F0-4 and \n\n5D4?\n7F6-3 transitions, respectively, which originates \n\n\n\nPorous Yttrium-Triphosphonate MOF \n\n235 \n \n\na red and green emitted light. Although, after instantaneous exposure (under ambient \n\nconditions) to the excited UV light, the visible emissions are relatively bright, their \n\nintensities quickly decrease becoming negligible in the time range. Thus, it is necessary to \n\nrecord a complete emission spectra (ca. 10 minutes) due to, most probably, an effective \n\nphotobleaching of the compounds. Because of that, the emission spectra are uncorrected \n\nand are only presented to elucidate the emission capability of the Tb3+ and Eu3+.  It is \n\nnoticeable a loss of the emission intensities on the high wavelength region for both spectra. \n\nIn the other hand, as observed for 30 (Figure 6.32 on top), the samples under vacuum (ca. \n\n10-3 mbar) undergo a phase transformation (evidenced by the changes observed on the Eu3+ \n\nemission lines) and their emissions became stable. This demonstrates that the application \n\nof a vacuum is able to remove the solvent molecules (water and methanol) located into the \n\nchannels promoting the phase transition, which should be the responsible for the \n\nphotobleaching activation observed at ambient pressure. This is in agreement with \n\nVTPXRD investigations, where it was possible to observe structural modifications after the \n\nrelease of the solvent molecules. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.32 - Ambient temperature emission spectra of 31 (green line) and 30 at \nambient pressure (red line) and under vacuum (black line) with excitation at 320 nm. \n\n \n\n \n\nEncompass the effective sensitization of the Tb3+ and Eu3+ emitter ions by the \n\nligand moieties mentioned above, the concentration of the optical active Ln3+ ions used in \n\nthe present case is not enough to receive all the UV light absorbed by the ligands and to \n\neliminate the intrinsic photoluminescence of the ligands in UV and visible region. In fact, \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n236 \n \n\nas can be seen in Figure 6.33, the complete emission spectra of 30 under vacuum in the \n\nUV/Vis region is characterized by the predominance of a strong UV band on the 340-440 \n\nnm range, which at 12 K has a structured profile. Considering the results of the time-\n\nresolved emission spectra depicted in Figure 6.33, this band should be attributed to the \n\nsuperposition of the S1?S0 fluorescence of the ligand (evidenced with the very short live \n\ndetection conditions) and to a most probably emission of their phosphonate groups, which \n\nhas some similarities with the emission of norbornene derived phosphonates recently \n\npresented by Bhattacharya et al.23 Note that the residual emission band obtained in the \n\n340-440 nm spectral region, applying an initial delay of 1 ms, cannot be attributed to the \n\ncommon ligand fluorescence, and in the present situation it has the exact same profile as \n\nthe emission band collected in the stationary state mode. Because of that, it can be \n\nspeculated the possible function of the phosphonate groups as optical active elements \n\nwhich can be also sensitized by the pure organic part of the ligand moiety. An additional \n\nemission in the region of 450 to 550 nm is also observed at 12 K which, based on their \n\nlong lifetime characteristics and their temperature dependence, is attributed to the ligand \n\ntriplet phosphorescence emission, probably conjugated with the phosphonate groups. More \n\ndetailed and comprehensive studies are needed to complete discern the role of the \n\nphosphonate groups on these promising optical active systems. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.33 - Stationary state UV/Vis emission spectra of 30 under vacuum recorded \nat 297 K (solid red line) and at 12 K (dotted red line) with the excitation at 300 nm, \nand corresponding time-resolved emission spectra (black line, initial delay 0.01 ms \nand integration time of 1 ms; blue line, initial delay 1 ms and integration time of 30 \nms) recorded at 12 K. The break in the graph signalizes the second order excitation \nposition.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPorous Yttrium-Triphosphonate MOF \n\n237 \n \n\n6.9. Results and Discussion \n \n\n This chapter summarized the synthesis and application of a family of isotypical \n\nporous MOFs, termed as [RE(H3L)]\u00b7xH2O\u00b7yMeOH [where RE\n3+ = Y3+ (29); (Y0.95Eu0.05)\n\n3+ \n\n(30) and (Y0.95Tb0.05)\n3+ (31)]. These compounds were typically prepared as \n\nmicrocrystalline powders. Isolation of large crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray \n\ndiffraction studies was a hard task. The material 29 may be prepared by using several \n\nsynthetic methods under very distinct reaction conditions: i) conventional solvothermal \n\nsynthesis (140 \u00baC for 48 h); ii) bench \u201cone-pot\u201d synthesis (60 \u00baC for 24 h); iii) slow \n\ndiffusion (ambient temperature for approximately 3 weeks); and iv) ionothermal synthesis \n\nusing the ionic liquid [EMIm]Cl (140 \u00baC for 72 h). Figure 6.34 summarizes the employed \n\nsynthetic approaches and the corresponding reaction conditions. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.34 \u2013 Schematic representation of the synthetic approaches and reaction \nconditions used to isolate compound 29. \n\n \n\n \n\nDespite the several attempts and efforts, isolation of 29 as large particles was \n\nunsuccessful. Nevertheless, using conventional solvothermal conditions and adding \n\ndifferent amounts of HCl (6 M) to the reactive mixtures single-crystals were isolated. \n\nThus, it is possible to conclude that this step is the key factor to improve crystallinity. \n\nMoreover the increase of the amount of HCl (6 M), until certain point, in the reaction \n\nmixtures leads to a substantial increase of the particle size.  \n\nThe bench \u201cone-pot\u201d approach exhibited itself, once again, as an excellent \n\nalternative to prepare large amounts (i.e., in the gram-scale) of desired MOF 29 at milder \n\nreaction conditions during acceptable periods of time. This methodology has in this way a \n\nhandful of attractive features which make it a strong synthetic alternative to large scale \n\nsynthesis: it allows the preparation of MOFs in a very simple way with low energy-\n\nconsumption. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n238 \n \n\nFrom thermal analyses, it was possible to observe that the crystalline structure of \n\ncompound 29 suffers some modifications when submitted to thermal treatment. Although \n\nthe structure of 29 is still not completely elucidated, preliminary studies indicated that this \n\nporous material has its channels filled of solvent molecules (water and methanol) of \n\ncrystallization. Therefore, the release of these molecules occurs easily from low \n\ntemperatures (the solvent molecules are released below ca. 100 \u00baC). This fact may induce a \n\nrearrangement, as for instance a possible contraction, in the network of 29. Nevertheless, it \n\nis noteworthy to observe that the new desolvated material is robust being stable up to \n\napproximately 400 \u00baC. This is an uncommon feature, which mechanically appears \n\nnevertheless more often in phosphonate-based MOFs than, for instance, in carboxylate-\n\nbased ones. In this context, this robustness provides this material the possibility to be \n\napplied in areas which require more severe conditions (e.g., higher temperatures and \n\nactivation of the pores). \n\n The selective adsorption properties of compound 29 were studied. From the \n\nconventional single component adsorption isotherms it was observed that this material is \n\nable to incorporate significant amounts of CO2 molecules into its structure. Regarding to \n\nN2, compound 29 presents some diffusion problems toward this gas. This behavior appears \n\nas typical of ultramicroporous materials with pore size &lt;0.5 nm. Additionally, the \n\nperformance of 29 in gas separation processes, using binary (i.e., C3H6/C3H8 and CO2/N2) \n\nand ternary (i.e., CH4/CO2/C2H2 and N2/CO2/C2H2) mixtures of gases, was evaluated by \n\nemploying advanced measurements: pulse gas chromatography and gas separation \n\nbreakthrough measurements. After these tests, the results suggest that the desolvated form \n\nof compound 29:  \n\ni) has the ability to retain higher amounts of propylene (4.47 mmol g-1 at 273 K and \n\n4.03 mmol g-1 at 296 K) than propane (3.13 mmol g-1 at 273 K and 2.59 mmol g-1 at \n\n296 K);  \n\nii) is able to separate to nearly 100% of purity propane from a mixture composed of \n\nC3H6/C3H8 during a certain period of time; \n\niii) shows the capacity to selectively adsorb CO2 (polar gas) over the N2 (non-polar); \n\niv) has high affinity for acetylene (observed from the pulse gas chromatographic \n\nmeasurements) over CO2; the separation of these gases was not, nevertheless, \n\nachieved using a mixture composed of CO2/C2H2. \n\nPropylene-propane separation processes, using porous MOFs, have been tested by \n\nseveral scientists because this field is of great scientific and industrial interest.20,24-29 In the \n\nreported MOFs the higher affinity to propylene over propane is related to the presence of \n\nthe C=C bond: the ?* orbital interacts typically with the electron density of the metal \n\ncations, leading to strong interactions with this gas over propane.20,28,30-32 \n\nThe CO2/C2H2 separation is also of significant industrial interest. Acetylene is an \n\nimportant molecule which has been used as starting material, as for instance, for the \n\nproduction of chemical products.33 However, opposite to C3H6/C3H8 separation, the \n\n\n\nPorous Yttrium-Triphosphonate MOF \n\n239 \n \n\nselective separation between C2H2 over CO2 was, unfortunately, not achieved with 29. This \n\nfact may be due to the similarity existing between the nature of them, as for instance, their \n\nsublimation points, critical temperatures and molecular size.34 In order to improve the \n\nselective CO2/C2H2 separation it was prepared the ion-exchanged compound 32 using 29 as \n\nstarting material. Results suggest that 32 has higher capacity to adsorb CO2, mainly at \n\nhigher temperatures. Performing a preliminary breakthrough measurement it was possible \n\nto observe that this new material exhibits the ability to retain CO2 while C2H2 is firstly \n\nreleased. Thus, the purification of acetylene (of approximately 100%) using a CO2/C2H2 \n\ngas mixture was achieved during a certain period of time (for approximately 1 minute). \n\nThe improvement in the separation process may be attributed to the introduction of the K+ \n\ncations into the framework of 29. These sites may allow the coordination with CO2 \n\nmolecules, improving their affinity with the material. This behavior leads to a later release \n\nof CO2 from the porous structure of 32, allowing first the release of C2H2, which has not \n\nstrong affinity with the material. Additionally, the selectively adsorption of CO2 over C2H2 \n\nmay be further improved if, as for instance, two chromatographic columns packed with 32, \n\ninstead one, can be used.   \n\n To the best of knowledge, only two reports describe the adsorption capacity of \n\nphosphonate-based MOFs toward some gases (i.e., CO2, CO and CH4). In 2008, Wright\u2019s \n\ngroup reported that a porous MOF, termed Ni-STA-12, had the ability to uptake ten times \n\nCO2 (2.5 mmol g\n-1) than CH4 at 304 K from 0 to 1 bar.\n\n35 Latter, in 2012, the same research \n\ngroup performed some breakthrough tests using a family of STA-12 porous materials \n\n(having Mg, Mn, Fe, Co or Ni as metallic centers).36 The STA-12(Ni) material exhibited \n\nCO2 selective adsorption over CH4 and CO. This material showed selectivities to CO2 of \n\n6.5 (at 1 bar) and 24.4 (at 5 bar) at 303 K using a CO2/CH4 (1:1) gas mixture. The latter \n\nwork is the unique example reported in the literature describing gas separation \n\nbreakthrough studies using a phosphonate-based MOF for the selective adsorption of CO2 \n\nover other gases. The work reported in this chapter constitutes the first time a phosphonate-\n\nbased MOF has been used for C3H6/C3H8, CO2/N2, CH4/CO2/C2H2 and N2/CO2/C2H2 \n\nseparation processes. \n\nThe effect of the desolvation process of the porous material 29 as well as the \n\ninfluence of different CO2 flow pressures was investigated by high-resolution synchrotron \n\npowder X-ray diffraction (performed in ESRF). These experiments aimed to gain insight \n\non the stability and robustness of the crystalline structure of this compound. These \n\ninvolved different two main tasks: i) evacuation of the solvent molecules of the studied \n\nmaterial using a He flow; and ii) variation of the CO2 flow pressures (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 bar) \n\nat 273 and 303 K. The obtained data suggest that it occurs some structural modifications in \n\n29 after its desolvation process, affording a new desolvated material still more crystalline. \n\nThese observations agree to those collecting in the VTPXRD studies. Nevertheless, it was \n\nconcluded that this new phase is highly robust and stable when different CO2 flow \n\npressures were tested at different temperatures (273 and 303 K). \n\n The photoluminescent properties of compounds 30 and 31 were investigated. Eu3+- \n\nand Tb3+-based materials emitted relatively intense red and green light, respectively. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n240 \n \n\nNevertheless, these intensities decrease very quickly and it was not possible to collect a \n\ncomplete emission spectra in the time range needed. This fact may be related to an \n\neffective photobleaching resulting from the instability and possible degradation of the \n\ntested compounds. As mentioned above, the release of the solvent molecules (water and \n\nmethanol), even at low temperatures, of 29 led to structural modifications. This may justify \n\nthe difficulty in collecting the photoluminescence data. These results are only some \n\npreliminary studies and it is necessary to investigate in more details these properties. \n\n\n\nPorous Yttrium-Triphosphonate MOF \n\n241 \n \n\n6.10.

Efforts were directed and focused toward the optimization of the ideal reaction \n\nconditions as well as the choice of the best synthetic approaches to isolate both organic \n\nlinkers and multidimentional MOFs in high yields and, at the same time, with a high level \n\nof purity.  \n\n The preparation of the phosphonate-based organic ligands H4pmd, H6bmt, H6tftp \n\nand H6L involved the strict optimization of several reaction conditions (e.g., reaction time, \n\ntemperature and solvents). Synthetic approaches used the conventional heating synthetic \n\nmethods or microwave heating which permitted the use of mild reaction conditions and a \n\ndrastic reduction of the total reaction time (as observed for the preparation of the large \n\ntripodal H6L organic ligand). This latter approach afforded the expected organic molecules \n\nin higher yields and in a fast, clean and safe way. These prepared multipodal linkers \n\nshowed to be suitable organic PBUs to employ (together with several rare-earth cations) \n\nfor the preparation of various and structurally distinct functional multidimentional MOFs. \n\nSingle-crystal X-ray diffraction in tandem with the standard liquid-state NMR \n\nspectroscopy and mass spectrometry proved to be useful tools to unequivocally unveil and \n\ncharacterize the structure of all organic ligands. \n\nThe structural properties of the organic ligands arises, undoubtedly, as crucial \n\nfactor in the preparation of multidimentional MOFs, mainly concerning their final \n\narchitecture. The use of the more flexible bipodal H4pmd and tripodal H6bmt and H6tftp \n\nmolecules led to the preparation of 1D to 3D relatively dense MOF materials. Conversely, \n\nthe large and rigid H6L ligand directed the isolation of the porous [Y(H3L)]\u00b7xH2O\u00b7yMeOH \n\n(29) material. The results found in this thesis come in line with those of several reports \n\npublished in the literature, in which porous, or highly porous MOF materials have been \n\nisolated by using rigid and, very often, very large organic ligands. The presence of the \n\nmethylene ?CH2? moiety in the former ligands embodies the former organic PBUs with \n\nsome degree of flexibility, resulting instead in the preparation of more dense MOFs.  \n\n The isolation of the several multidimensional MOFs was achieved by employing \n\ndistinct synthetic approaches: i) conventional hydro(solvo)thermal synthesis; ii) synthesis \n\nusing microwave or ultrasound irradiation; iii) bench \u201cone-pot\u201d synthesis; iv) ionothermal \n\nsynthesis. The hydro(solvo)thermal synthesis showed, as expected, to be a good choice to \n\nisolate large single-crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction studies. Nevertheless, the \n\npreparation of the [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] (1-3) and [Ln2(H3bmt)2]\u00b7H2O (12-19) materials with \n\nlarge particle size it was not achieved. \n\nDue to the general harsh reaction conditions (high temperatures) and long periods \n\nof time needed to prepare MOFs using the conventional hydro(solvo)thermal approach, \n\nother simpler, faster, cleaner and with low energy-consumption synthetic methodologies \n\nwere investigated. MWAS and the bench \u201cone-pot\u201d approaches emerged as good \n\nalternatives. Owing the easy close control of various reaction parameters (i.e., reaction \n\ntime and temperature, power and pressure), MWAS allowed the preparation of different \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n246                                                              \n\n \n\narchitectures using the same organic and inorganic PBUs: i) the self-assembly between \n\nH4pmd and La\n3+\n\n cations produce the 1D [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4) and the 3D \n\n[La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5) materials while varying the temperature and the irradiation \n\ntime; ii) a similar behaviour was observed in the preparation of the phase-pure 1D \n\n[La(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O (9) and 3D [La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (20) from reaction \n\nmixtures composed of H6bmt and La\n3+\n\n cations in distilled water. Additionally, MWAS \n\nalso permits a drastic reduction of the reaction time and temperature of the preparation of \n\nMOF materials usually synthesized using conventional hydrothermal synthesis: the \n\nisotypical [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] materials [where Ln\n3+\n\n = Eu\n3+\n\n (1), Gd\n3+\n\n (2) and Tb\n3+\n\n (3)] were \n\nisolated in very good yields, at 40 \u00baC under just 5 seconds of reaction time, while standard \n\nhydrothermal conditions required 180 \u00baC and a period of 72 h. MWAS exhibited also good \n\nreproducibility, the possibility to prepare MOF materials with homogeneous crystal \n\nmorphology and different particle sizes (ranging from nano- to micro-sized particles), \n\nwhile maintaining their crystal structure.  \n\nThe bench \u201cone-pot\u201d approach permitted the isolation of phase-pure 1D \n\n[La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4) and 2D [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5)  materials, and also the \n\n3D [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)2] (7) and [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)4] (8) compounds. This latter \n\nmaterial was, however, contaminated with other crystalline phases. \u201cOne-pot\u201d synthesis \n\nalso allowed the preparation of the porous MOF 29 at milder reaction conditions (60 \u00baC for \n\n24 h) when compared with the conventional solvothermal method (140 \u00baC for 48 h). In \n\nshort, the bench \u201cone-pot\u201d and MWAS approaches exhibited themselves as potential and \n\nsuitable synthetic alternatives to prepare MOFs in a simple and usually faster way with \n\nlow-energy consumption.  \n\n As mentioned in Chapter 1 the preparation of phosphonate-based MOFs is usually \n\nnot straightforward, mainly because the synthesis usually leads to microcrystalline \n\npowders, many of the times composed of mixtures of phases. In addition, the final \n\nstructure of this type of materials is also less predictable than when carboxylate or N-donor \n\norganic ligands are employed in the self-assembly process with, for example, transition \n\nmetals. This occurs mainly because the phosphonate organic linkers have several \n\ncoordination modes (as demonstrated abundantly in the various MOF structures reported in \n\nthis thesis) which allied with the typical high coordination numbers of lanthanides boost \n\nthe occurrence of supramolecular isomerism. In Chapters 5 and 6 the addition of controlled \n\namounts of an aqueous solution of HCl (6 M) promoted the isolation of phosphonate-based \n\nMOFs as large single crystals, ultimately avoiding the production of only microcrystalline \n\npowders.  \n\nThe photoluminescent properties of the optically-active Eu\n3+\n\n-based materials \n\n[Eu(Hpmd)(H2O)] (1),  [(La0.97Eu0.03)(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O (10), [(La0.95Eu0.05)2-\n\n(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (24) and [(La0.95Eu0.05)(H3tftp)(H2O)] (27), and the Tb\n3+\n\n-based \n\nmaterials  [Tb(Hpmd)(H2O)] (3) [(La0.97Tb0.03)(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O (11), \n\n[(La0.95Tb0.05)2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (25) and [(La0.95Tb0.05)(H3tftp)(H2O)] (28) were \n\ninvestigated. On the one hand, the Tb\n3+\n\n-based materials exhibited always higher absolute \n\nquantum yields than their Eu\n3+ \n\nanalogue materials. This demonstrates that the organic \n\n\n\nGeneral Conclusions \n\n247 \n\n \n\nligands employed are suitable sensitizers of Tb\n3+\n\n via the energy transfer process called \n\nantenna effect, leading to the isolation of intense green-emitting materials. On the other \n\nhand, the suppression of the O?H quenchers, as mentioned in Chapter 1, by deuteration or \n\ndehydration processes improved significantly the photoluminescent properties of some \n\nEu\n3+\n\n-based materials. The effect of the replacement of the C?H quenchers by C?F moieties \n\nin the photoluminescent properties of the fluorinated MOFs reported in this thesis did not \n\nlead to conclusive results. \n\nThe heterogeneous catalytic activity of the [Eu(Hpmd)(H2O)] (1), \n\n[La(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O (9) and [La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (20) materials in the \n\nring-opening reaction of styrene oxide (PhEtO) with methanol was investigated. \n\nCompounds 1, 9 and 20 showed to be truly heterogeneous catalysts and to exhibit excellent \n\nregioselectivity towards 2-methoxy-2-phenylethanol, which is always the sole reaction \n\nproduct. Compounds 9 and 20 can be recycled by simple and efficient regeneration \n\nprocesses. A comparative study between the catalyst 1 and its nanocrystalline form 1n \n\nrevealed that the latter exhibited much higher catalytic activity than 1 toward the \n\nconversion of PhEtO. This is, probably, related with the small particle size of 1n compared \n\nwith the microcrystalline phase. The catalytic activity of 20 increases from the first to the \n\nsecond and third catalytic runs promoted by the breaking of larger crystals into smaller \n\nones. This feature may lead to an increase in the number of effective active sites and, \n\nconsequently, increases the catalytic performance of the material, coming in line with that \n\nobserved for 1n. To summarize, it was found that 9 has higher catalytic activity \n\n(conversion of 100% of PhEtO toward the product 2-methoxy-2-phenylethanol at 55 \u00baC in \n\nonly 30 min) than 1, 1n and 20. This outstanding catalytic activity is related with the \n\namount of the active sites of 9 that are likely to be of Br\u00f6nsted type. \n\nA search in the literature reveals that some copper and iron-containing MOFs used \n\nas catalysts in the same reaction have relatively high PhEtO conversions reached at shorter \n\nreaction times and lower reaction temperatures. Nevertheless, for these transition-metal \n\nMOFs selectivity toward MeOPhEtOH was always less than 100%.\n1-2\n\n Layered \n\n[La(H3nmp)] led to 76% yield.\n3\n 2D or 3D [La(L)] led to 100% yield at 4 h.\n\n3\n The nano-\n\nsized HKUST-1 led to 90% of conversion at 40 \u00baC for 2.5h.\n4\n Compound 9 represents, until \n\nnow, the most outstanding catalytic activity in the ring-opening reaction of PhEtO with \n\nmethanol. \n\nThe performance of the porous MOF 29 was investigated in gas separation \n\nprocesses. This compound, after activation (desolvation), exhibited the capacity to separate \n\npropane over propylene, although not with 100% of purity, during a certain period of time. \n\nThe separation of acetylene over carbon dioxide was not achieved. However, after some \n\npreliminary screening tests concerning the preparation of the ion-exchanged material \n\n[Y(H3L)]\u00b7xSolvent_K (32) it was observed that acetylene was indeed separated (with \n\nalmost 100% of purity) over carbon dioxide. The inclusion of the K\n+\n cations into the \n\nframework of 29 led to a higher ability of this compound to retain CO2. \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n248                                                              \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\n(1) Dhakshinamoorthy, A.; Alvaro, M.; Garcia, H.; Chem.-Eur.

Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction Studies \n \n\nSingle crystals of the organic molecules IL2, IL3, IL4, H6tftp and H6L, and the \n\nmaterials 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26 and 29 were manually harvested from the reaction \n\nvessel and immediately immersed in highly viscous FOMBLIN Y perfluoropolyether \n\nvacuum oil (LVAC 140/13, Sigma-Aldrich) to avoid degradation caused by the \n\nevaporation of the solvent. Crystals were mounted on Hampton Research CryoLoops with \n\nthe help of a Stemi 2000 stereomicroscope equipped with Carl Zeiss lenses.1 The selection \n\nof a suitable single-crystal for analysis was a challenging task because they frequently \n\npresented cracks. Because of this, several data sets were collected, and the crystal model \n\nherein presented corresponds to the best solution that could be found. Data were collected \n\non a Bruker X8 Kappa APEX II CCD area-detector diffractometer (Mo K? graphite-\n\nmonochromated radiation, ? = 0.71073 \u00c5) controlled by the APEX2 software package2 and \n\nequipped with an Oxford Cryosystems Series 700 cryostream monitored remotely using \n\nthe software interface Cryopad.3 Images were processed using the software package \n\nSAINT+,4 and data were corrected for absorption by the multiscan semi-empirical method \n\n\n\nExperimental Section \n\n253 \n \n\nimplemented in SADABS.5 The structure was solved using the Patterson synthesis \n\nalgorithm implemented in SHELXS-97,6, 7 which allowed the immediate location of the \n\ntwo crystallographically independent La3+ centres and most of the heaviest atoms \n\nbelonging to the organic linkers. The remaining non-hydrogen atoms were located from \n\ndifference Fourier maps calculated from successive full-matrix least-squares refinement \n\ncycles on F2 using SHELXL-97.7, 8 All the non-hydrogen atoms were successfully refined \n\nby assuming anisotropic displacement parameters. \n\n \n\n \n\n8.4. Structural Determination: Laboratory Powder X-ray \n\nDiffraction \n\n \n\nConventional powder X-ray diffraction data for the bulk materials 1, 2, 3, 8 and 12, \n\nsuitable for structural refinements were collected at ambient temperature on a X\u2019Pert MPD \n\nPhilips diffractometer (Cu K?1,2 X-radiation, ?1 = 1.540598 \u00c5 and ?2 = 1.544426 \u00c5), \n\nequipped with a X\u2019Celerator detector and a flat-plate sample holder in a Bragg-Brentano \n\npara-focusing optics configuration (40 kV, 50 mA).  Intensity data were collected by the \n\nstep-counting method (step 0.02\u00ba), in continuous mode, in the ca. 4 ? 2? ? 110\u00ba range. \n\nPowder patterns were readily indexed with DICVOL04,9 thus unequivocally \n\nconfirming the assumed structural similarities with compounds [Ce(Hpmd)(H2O)] and \n\n[Pr(Hpmd)(H2O)] previously reported by the MOF research group at the University of \n\nAveiro.10 Rietveld structural refinements11 using as starting premise the atomic coordinates \n\nof the aforementioned structures were performed with FullProf.2k.12, 13 Background was \n\ncorrected using fixed points throughout the entire angular range determined by the linear \n\ninterpolation between consecutive (and manually selected) breakpoints in the powder \n\npattern. Cauchy profile functions, along with two asymmetry correction parameters, were \n\nselected to generate the line shapes of the simulated diffraction peaks.  The angular \n\ndependence of the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of individual reflections was also \n\ntaken into account by employing a Caglioti function correction.14 \n\n \n\n  \n\n8.5. Variable-Temperature Powder X-ray Diffraction \n \n\nVariable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction data for [La(H3tftp)(H2O)] (1) were \n\ncollected on a D8 Advance Bruker diffractometer (Cu K ?1,2 X-radiation, ?1 = 1.540598 \u00c5; \n\n?2 = 1.544426 \u00c5) under air atmosphere, equipped with a LynxEye detector, curved \n\ngraphite-monochromated radiation, a flat-plate low background  Si wafer (911 oriented) as \n\nsample holder in a Bragg-Brentano para-focusing optics configuration (40 kV, 50 mA), \n\nand a high-temperature Anton Parr HTK1200 chamber. Intensity data were collected in the \n\nstep mode (0.02\u00ba) in the range ca. 5 ? 2? ? 50\u00ba.  Data were collected between ambient \n\ntemperature and 1000 \u00baC. \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n254 \n \n\n8.6. Photoluminescence Spectroscopy \n \n\nEmission and excitation spectra were recorded on a Fluorolog-2\u00ae Horiba Scientific \n\n(Model FL3-2T) spectroscope, with a modular double grating excitation spectrometer \n\n(fitted with a 1200 grooves/mm grating blazed at 330 nm) and a TRIAX 320 single \n\nemission monochromator (fitted with a 1200 grooves/mm grating blazed at 500 nm, \n\nreciprocal linear density of 2.6 nm\u00b7mm-1), coupled to a R928 Hamamatsu photomultiplier, \n\nusing the front face acquisition mode. The excitation source was a 450 W Xe arc lamp. \n\nEmission spectra were corrected for detection and optical spectral response of the \n\nspectrofluorimeter and the excitation spectra were corrected for the spectral distribution of \n\nthe lamp intensity using a photodiode reference detector. Time-resolved measurements \n\nhave been carried out using a 1934D3 phosphorimeter coupled to the Fluorolog\u00ae-3, and a \n\nXe-Hg flash lamp (6 \u00b5s/pulse half width and 20-30 \u00b5s tail) was used as the excitation \n\nsource. The variable temperature measurements were performed using a helium-closed \n\ncycle cryostat with vacuum system measuring ~5\u00d710-6 mbar and a Lakeshore 330 auto-\n\ntuning temperature controller with a resistance heater. The temperature can be adjusted \n\nfrom 11 to 450 K. \n\nThe absolute emission quantum yields were measured at ambient temperature using \n\na quantum yield measurement system C9920-02 from Hamamatsu with a 150 W Xenon \n\nlamp coupled to a monochromator for wavelength discrimination, an integrating sphere as \n\nsample chamber and a multi-channel analyzer for signal detection. Three measurements \n\nwere made for each sample so that the average value is reported. The method is accurate to \n\nwithin 10%. \n\n \n\n \n\n8.7. Heterogeneous Catalysis \n \n\nA 5 mL borosilicate batch reactor, equipped with a magnetic stirrer (800 rpm) and a \n\nvalve for sampling, was charged with the catalysts 1, 1n, 9 and 20 (or with the organic \n\nligands H4pmd or H6bmt, or lanthanide precursors EuCl3\u00b76H2O and LaCl3\u00b77H2O), 1.5 mL \n\nof methanol and 0.4 M of styrene oxide (PhEtO). The reaction was carried out under \n\natmospheric air, with the batch reactor immersed in an external thermostated oil bath (35 \n\nor 55 \u00baC). Prior to reuse, the solid catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by \n\ncentrifugation, washed with methanol and dried at 55 \u00baC (under atmospheric air). Leaching \n\ntests were carried out by heating a suspension of the catalyst (fresh or used) in methanol \n\nfor 1 h at 35 or 55 \u00baC (under agitation), subsequently filtering the solid at 35 or 55 \u00baC \n\nthrough a 0.20 \u00b5m PVDF w/ GMF Whatman membrane, and finally adding PhEtO to the \n\nfiltrate and monitoring the reaction of PhEtO at 35 or 55 \u00baC, under agitation.  \n\nThe progress of the catalytic reactions was monitored using a Varian 3900 GC \n\nequipped with a capillary column (SPB-5, 20 m \u00d7 0.25 mm) and a flame ionization \n\ndetector (using mesitylene as an internal standard). The identification of the reaction \n\n\n\nExperimental Section \n\n255 \n \n\nproduct was carried out by GC-MS (Trace GC 2000 Series (Thermo Quest CE \n\nInstruments) - DSQ II (Thermo Scientific)), using He as the carrier gas. \n\n \n\n \n\n8.8. Adsorption Studies \n \n\n8.8.1. Gas Adsorption Measurements \n\nConventional adsorption isotherms were measured using a Micromeritics Tristar \n\n3000 volumetric instrument under continuous adsorption conditions. \n\nBrunauer?Emmet?Teller (BET) were carried out to determine the total specific surface \n\nareas for the N2 and CO2 isotherms at 77 and 195 K, respectively. In addition, CO2 \n\nisotherms at 195 K were measured to evaluate the micropore region by means of the \n\nDubinin?Radushkevich equation. Prior to measurement, the powdered material 29 was \n\noutgassed to 10?6 Torr and heated at 423 K for 7 h. \n\n \n\n8.8.2. Variable-Temperature Pulse Gas Chromatography \n\nGas-phase adsorption at zero coverage surface was studied using the pulse \n\nchromatographic technique, employing a gas chromatograph (Varian 450-GC) equipped \n\nwith a home-made chromatographic column, with 0.4 cm internal diameter and 29 cm of \n\nlength. The columns was packed with ca. 0.543 g of the powdered material 29. For the \n\nactivation of the materials, a He flow (20 mL min?1) was passed through the column at 423 \n\nK during approximately 4 h. Later, 0.6 mL of equimolecular gas mixtures of C2H2/CO2/H2 \n\nand C3H6/C3H8/H2 were injected at 1 bar on a He flow (20 mL min\n?1). The separation \n\nperformance of the chromatographic column was then examined at different temperatures \n\n(273?403 K) by means of a mass spectrometer gas analysis system (Pfeiffer Vacoon), \n\ndetecting ion peaks at m/z 44 (CO2 and C3H8), 42 (C3H6), 26 (C2H2), 4 (He) and 2 (H2). \n\nThe dead volume of the system was calculated using the retention time of hydrogen as a \n\nreference. \n\n \n\n8.8.3. Breakthrough Experiments for Gas Separation \n\nThe chromatographic column, prepared as detailed in the section above, was \n\nactivated under a pure He flow (20 mL min?1) at 423 K during approximately 4 h and then \n\nused for evaluating the N2/CO2, N2/C3H8, N2/C3H6, C3H8/C3H6, CH4/CO2/C2H2 and \n\nN2/CO2/C2H2 separation performances of the material 29. The desired gas mixture (20 mL \n\nmin?1) was prepared via mass flow controllers. For instance, N2/CO2 (0.85:0.15) mixtures \n\nwere prepared to simulate the emission of flue gas from a power plant employing 3 mL \n\nmin?1 of CO2 and 17 mL min\n?1 of N2 flows, and the breakthrough experiments were \n\ncarried out at different temperatures (273-323 K) by step changes from He to N2/CO2 flow \n\nmixtures. The relative amounts of gases passing through the column were monitored on a \n\nmass spectrometer gas analysis system (Pfeiffer Vacoon) detecting ion peaks at m/z 44 \n\n(CO2 and C3H8), 42 (C3H6), 26 (C2H2), 4 (He) and 2 (H2). \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n256 \n \n\n8.9.

The reaction mixture was kept under \n\nconstant magnetic stirring and heated to reflux. The evolution of the reaction was \n\ncontrolled by TLC and stopped after approximately 20 h, when the hydrolysis was \n\ncomplete. Impurities were successfully eliminated via a liquid/liquid extraction with \n\ndichloromethane.

The reaction mixture was kept inside a CEM Focused \n\nMicrowave Synthesis System Discover S-Class equipment, under constant magnetic \n\nstirring (controlled by the microwave equipment), employing an irradiation power of 120 \n\nW for 20 min. The initial reaction temperature was 230 \u00baC (achieved by using a weflon \n\nstirring bar), starting to decrease when the pressure inside the reactor reached 100 psi (limit \n\nvalue selected). The close control of the temperature inside the reactor was ensured with a \n\nconstant flow of air (ca. 20-30 psi of pressure). After the reaction, the excess of triethyl \n\nphosphite was removed under reduced pressure and the crude product was purified by flash \n\ncolumn chromatography using dichloromethane/methanol (97%:3%) as eluent. The \n\nresulting yellowish and viscous oily residue was washed with petroleum ether in an \n\nultrasonic bath and the target organic intermediate IL4 was obtained, as a white powder, in \n\n83% yield. \n\n The IL4 intermediate (1.30 g, 1.82 mmol) was added to an aqueous solution of \n\nconcentrated HCl (50 mL, 12 M) and the resulting reaction mixture was refluxed, under \n\nconstant magnetic stirring, for approximately 48 h.

After cooling to \n\nambient temperature, the reaction mixture was washed with dichloromethane and the \n\nresulting residue was dissolved in methanol, being then distilled under reduced pressure. \n\nThe resulting brownish viscous residue was redissolved with dried methanol and a mixture \n\nof dried toluene and dried hexane (1:1) was added. The solvents were distilled under \n\nreduced pressure. The resulting residue was dried under vacuum affording a yellowish \n\nfoam, which was dissolved in a small amount of dried methanol (2-3 mL) occurring then \n\nthe precipitation of the desired H6L compound as a white powder (yield of 93%). \n\n \n\nIL\n4: 1H NMR (300.13 MHz, CDCl3) ?

Both \n\nthe suspension and the recovered solid were the subject to further characterization in order \n\nto confirm the presence of either [Eu(Hpmd)(H2O)] (1) or [Tb(Hpmd)(H2O)] (2). \n\nThe following experimental conditions were systematically varied in order to \n\noptimize the synthetic conditions aiming at isolating separated nano-particles: \n\n(i) Temperature: ambient temperature, 60 and 70\u00baC; \n\n(ii) Reaction time (ultra-sound irradiation): 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 20 or 30 min; \n\n(iii) Composition of the reactive mixtures: Ln3+ : H4pmd : H2O molar ratios of \n\nabout 1 : 1 : 600, 1 : 1 : 1200, 1 : 1 : 1800, 1 : 1 : 3600 or 1 : 1 : 7200. \n\nIsolated nanoparticles of 1 were obtained when the reaction was performed at ambient \n\ntemperature, during 5 minutes of ultrasonic irradiation with a molar ratio of the reactive \n\nmixture of about 1 : 1 : 7200.  Identical nanoparticles of compound 2 were isolated using \n\nsimilar experimental conditions. \n\n \n\n8.10.1.4. Theoretical Calculations \n\nAb initio calculations were performed using the G03w package15 on the \n\nmultiprocessor cluster Flamingo belonging to CICECO, University of Aveiro. Partial \n\noptimized geometries, harmonic vibrational frequencies and intensities were obtained at \n\nthe B3LYP level using the Los Alamos Effective Core Potentials plus double-zeta basis set \n\n(LanL2DZ option of G03). The basis set for phosphorus was extended with a d function. \n\nWe have observed from the crystallographic studies that the structural and \n\nvibrational features remain constant for the investigated lanthanides. Assuming that the \n\nlanthanum-based compound is isostructural, and because this metal is more convenient due \n\nto the absence of f electrons, the crystal structure of the praseodymium-based compound \n\nwas used as a model with the praseodymium atoms being substituted by lanthanum.10  \n\nThe whole framework was divided in three independent model structures \n\ncorresponding to the phosphonate, hydrogenophosphonate and water ligands. Each one of \n\nthese moieties, and the respective metal center, were allowed to be optimized inside a box \n\nof fixed atoms. Each model structure was further divided into layers: one layer corresponds \n\nto one of the ligands and the metal, and was set free in the optimization; the other layer is \n\ncomposed by the neighboring atoms up to a distance of about 2 \u00c5 from those of the central \n\nlayer. These layers were built from the real crystallographic data, using the Diamond \n\nsoftware package.16 The partial optimization, with the internal layer free and the other \n\n\n\nExperimental Section \n\n263 \n \n\nlayers fixed, led to fragments very similar analogous in the crystal structure. The \n\ntheoretical spectrum of the structure was obtained by adding the three fractional spectra. \n\n \n\n8.10.2.

Microwave-assisted synthesis  \n\nMixtures of H4pmd (0.1477g, 0.55 mmol) and water (ca. 6 mL) were stirred at \n\nambient temperature inside a 10 mL IntelliVent microwave reactor for ca. 5 min. \n\nLaCl3\u00b77H2O (0.2061 g, 0.55 mmol) was then added obtaining an overall molar ratio of ca. \n\n1:1:600 (La3+:H4pmd:H2O) for the reactive mixture. The resulting homogeneous \n\nsuspension was placed inside a CEM Focused Microwave\u2122 Synthesis System Discover S-\n\nClass equipment and was kept under constant magnetic stirring (controlled by the \n\nmicrowave equipment). A constant flow of air (ca. 20-30 psi of pressure) ensured a close \n\ncontrol of the temperature inside the reactor.  \n\nSynthetic conditions were investigated by systematically varying the experimental \n\nparameters: (i) temperature (30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 70, 90, 120 and 150 \u00baC); (ii) power (10, 25 \n\nand 50 W); (iii) irradiation time (1, 3, 5 and 10 min).  \n\nAfter reacting, a white precipitate was obtained, and the final product was \n\nrecovered by vacuum filtration, followed by washing with abundant amounts of distilled \n\nwater, and then air-dried. \n\n \n\n8.10.2.2.
