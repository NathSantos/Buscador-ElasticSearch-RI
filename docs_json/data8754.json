In this intimate association the obligate biotrophic fungi provide \n\nterrestrial plants with minerals, nutrients (particularly inorganic phosphate) and water \n\nincreasing the host resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, including pathogens, \n\nwater limitation and environmental pollutants in return for photosynthates. Diversity of \n\nAMF is generally higher in natural and semi-natural systems than in more intensively \n\nmanaged agroecosystems, where it can be strongly reduced. The objective of this \n\nstudy was to investigate whether land use type can be characterized by their \n\narbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities, and to test the potential effect of \n\nAMF indigenous as inoculants on crops productivity and host tolerance to root-knot \n\nMeloidogyne incognita. \n\nAMF community structure associated to Holcus lanatus L. root was studied during two \n\nyears in two land uses: semi-natural (Pico do Galhardo- PX; Terra Brava- TB) and \n\nintensive (Agualva 1- RP1; Agualva 2- RP2) pastures of Terceira Island (Azores). The \n\nspore community composition of AMF associated to Holcus lanatus L. root was \n\ndetermined by taxonomic identification of AMF spores. Thirthy-nine AMF species \n\nrepresenting eight genera were detected in the land uses studied. The most \n\nrepresentative genera of AMF spore community were Glomus, Acaulospora and \n\nScutellospora.  Land use type had no significant effect on AMF spore diversity and \n\ntotal abundance. This also was confirmed by molecular methods (PCR-DGGE) on \n\nroots of H. lanatus. In Azorean pastureland the input of fertilisers is lower than average \n\ninputs to pastures on the European mainland, which presumably did not contribute to \n\noccurrence of an evident pattern of AMF diversity. However, the reverse was observed \n\nfor colonisation of different AMF structures (arbuscules, vesicles and hyphae) on H. \n\nlanatus root, where the highest of AMF colonisation was in semi-natural use. \n\nColonisation of different AMF structures on H. lanatus root showed a seasonal pattern \n\nbetween sampling dates. The higher abundance of AMF structures in the summer than \n\nin autumn/winter could be related to nutrient exchanges, host metabolic pathway, \n\nphenology and climatic variations.  \n\n\n\n14\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nStriking differences were found in AMF spores composition between land uses. \n\nSpecies of Glomus were dominant in intensive land uses, while Acaulospora and \n\nScutellospora predominated in semi-natural ones. Different strategies of colonisation \n\namong AMF and soil nutrient levels may be the most important factors influencing the \n\nAMF community. Members of Glomaceae have a highly infective extra-radical \n\nmycelium that could allow colonising immediately plant roots (early succession), while \n\nmembers of Gigasporaceae are only capable of propagation via spore dispersal, \n\ntherefore colonize plant roots more slowly than members of Glomaceae. Both spore \n\ndensities of Glomus, Acaulospora and Scutellospora genera, as well as root \n\ncolonisation were related with soil nutrients (N, K, Mg, Ca, OM), but no correlation was \n\nfound with soil phosphorus (P). Our results confirm that the degree of AMF benefit to a \n\nhost plant depends on plant species. Lolium perenne L. was the most mycorrhizal \n\ndependent plant (DM= 62%), followed by Holcus lanatus L. (DM= 40%) which resulted \n\nin an increase of foliar biomass more than 30 % in both plant species caused by \n\ninoculation with native AMF. Conversely, Lolium multiflorum L. was the less \n\nmycorrhizal dependent (DM= 27%) plant and also the less colonised. \n\nIn more than 90% of the samples, inoculation with the native AMF conferred protection \n\nto H. lanatus from the root-knot Meloidogyne incognita. Among the mechanism \n\nproposed to explain the protective effect of AMF, we suggest that plant growth \n\npromotion by AMF, and direct competition between AMF and the nematode for host \n\ncolonisation sites and photosynthates were involved.  \n\nWe conclude that: either AMF spore diversity or AMF diversity on H. lanatus root were \n\nindependent of land use intensity; However,  in the intensive management regime,  \n\nthere was a trend to an increased incidence of certain AMF, especially from the \n\nGlomus indicating a potentially severe loss of ecosystem functions under this land use \n\ntype; colonisation of different AMF structures was higher in semi-natural land use and \n\nshowed a marked seasonal pattern, dependent of plant phenology and metabolic \n\npathway and climatic conditions. Inoculation with indigenous AMF significantly \n\nincreased plant productivity and tolerance to root-knot M. incognita, but degree of AMF \n\nbenefit to a host plant varies in function of plant species. Thus, AMF may play an \n\nimportant role in ecosystems functioning, since their appropriate management can \n\nreduce the use of chemical and energy in agriculture and consequently lead to more \n\neconomical and sustainable production systems. \n\n \n\n\n\n15\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nResumo \n\nOs fungos micorr\u00edzicos arbusculares (FMA) s\u00e3o associa\u00e7\u00f5es simbi\u00f3ticas envolvendo \n\numa ampla diversidade de plantas (aproximadamente 80%), e fungos simbiontes \n\nobrigat\u00f3rios do filo Glomeromycota cuja origem estima-se ter ocorrido h\u00e1 400-500 \n\nmilh\u00f5es de anos. Nesta \u00edntima associa\u00e7\u00e3o o fungo biotr\u00f3fico obrigat\u00f3rio supre a planta \n\ncom minerais, nutrientes (particularmente fosfato inorg\u00e2nico) e \u00e1gua, aumentando \n\ndeste modo, a resist\u00eancia da planta hospedeira a stresses bi\u00f3ticos e abi\u00f3ticos, \n\nincluindo agentes patog\u00e9nicos, stress hidr\u00edco e poluentes ambientais em troca de \n\nprodutos fotoss\u00edntetizados. A diversidade de FMA \u00e9 geralmente mais elevada em \n\nsistemas naturais e semi-naturais do que em agro-ecossistemas mais intensivos, \n\nonde poder\u00e1 ser fortemente reduzida. O objectivo deste estudo foi investigar se as \n\ncomunidades de fungos micorr\u00edzicos poder\u00e3o servir de ferramentas na caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndo tipo de maneio do solo, e testar o potencial efeito da inocula\u00e7\u00e3o com fungos \n\nnativos na produtividade das culturas, bem como na sua toler\u00e2ncia a nem\u00e1todes \n\nformadores de galhas - Meloidogyne incognita. \n\nA estrutura da comunidade micorr\u00edzica associada \u00e0s ra\u00edzes de Holcus lanatus L. foi \n\nestudada durante dois anos em dois sistemas de uso do solo: pastagens semi-\n\nnaturais (Pico do Galhardo- PX; Terra Brava- TB) e intensivas (Agualva 1- RP1; \n\nAgualva 2- RP2) da ilha Terceira (A\u00e7ores). A composi\u00e7\u00e3o da comunidade de FMA \n\nassociada a H. lanatus foi determinada tendo em conta as caracter\u00edsticas \n\nmorfol\u00f3gicas dos esporos de FMA. Nos dois sistemas de maneio do solo foram \n\ndetectadas 39 esp\u00e9cies de FMA distribu\u00eddas por 8 g\u00e9neros. Os g\u00e9neros mais \n\nrepresentativos foram Glomus, Acaulospora e Scutellospora. A diversidade de \n\nesporos de FMA, assim como, a sua abund\u00e2ncia n\u00e3o foi afectada pelo tipo de maneio \n\ndo solo. Este resultado tamb\u00e9m foi confirmado por via molecular (PCR-DGGE), em \n\nrela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 diversidade de esp\u00e9cies da comunidade f\u00fangica nas ra\u00edzes de H. lanatus. \n\nOs n\u00edveis de fertilizantes aplicados nas pastagens a\u00e7orianas s\u00e3o em m\u00e9dia muito \n\nmais baixos, do que os aplicados em pastagens do continente Europeu, o que \n\npresumivelmente n\u00e3o ter\u00e1 contribu\u00eddo para a obten\u00e7\u00e3o de um evidente padr\u00e3o de \n\ndiversidade micorr\u00edzica. Contudo, a quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o da coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o das diferentes \n\nestruturas micorr\u00edzicas (arb\u00fasculos, ves\u00edculas e hifas) exibiu o padr\u00e3o diferente, tendo \n\nsido mais elevada nas pastagens semi-naturais do que nas intensivas. Al\u00e9m disso, as \n\ndiferentes estruturas micorr\u00edzicas exibiram um marcado padr\u00e3o sazonal entre \u00e9pocas \n\n\n\n16\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nde amostragem, tendo sido mais abundantes durante o Ver\u00e3o do que no \n\nOutono/Inverno. Este facto, poder\u00e1 estar relacionado com as trocas de nutrientes, a \n\nvia metab\u00f3lica do carbono da planta hospedeira, o estado fenol\u00f3gico e com as \n\nvaria\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas. Foram encontradas profundas diferen\u00e7as na composi\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nesp\u00e9cies entre os dois sistemas de uso do solo. Nos sistemas semi-naturais os \n\ng\u00e9neros mais representativos foram Acaulospora e Scutellospora, enquanto nos \n\nintensivos dominaram as esp\u00e9cies pertencentes ao g\u00e9nero Glomus. O tipo de \n\nestrat\u00e9gia de coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o adoptado pelos diferentes FMA, bem como, os n\u00edveis de \n\nnutrientes do solo, poder\u00e3o ser os principais factores respons\u00e1veis por essas \n\ndiferen\u00e7as na comunidade micorr\u00edzica. Os membros da fam\u00edlia Glomeraceae possuem \n\num mic\u00e9lio extra-radicular altamente infectivo que lhes permite uma r\u00e1pida \n\ncoloniza\u00e7\u00e3o radicular, enquanto os membros da fam\u00edlia Gigasporaceae, visto serem \n\napenas capazes de se propagarem via dispers\u00e3o dos esporos apresentam uma taxa \n\nde coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o mais lenta. A densidade de esporos dos g\u00e9neros Glomus, \n\nAcaulospora e Scutellospora assim como, a coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o radicular estiveram \n\ncorrelacionados com o n\u00edvel de nutrientes do solo (N, K, Mg, Ca, MO), excepto com o \n\nf\u00f3sforo (P). Os nossos resultados confirmam que, os benef\u00edcios resultantes da rela\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nsimbi\u00f3tica dependem da esp\u00e9cie de planta hospedeira. Lolium perenne L. foi a planta \n\nque exibiu maior depend\u00eancia micorr\u00edzica (DM= 62%) seguida de Holcus lanatus L. \n\n(DM= 40%), o que originou um incremento na biomassa foliar superior a 30 % em \n\nambas as esp\u00e9cies de plantas. Contrariamente, Lolium multiflorum Lam. foi a esp\u00e9cie \n\nde planta com menor percentagem de coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o micorrizica, e por conseguinte a \n\nmenos dependente da micorriza\u00e7\u00e3o (DM= 27%).  \n\nA inocula\u00e7\u00e3o com FMA nativos aumentou a toler\u00e2ncia de H. lanatus \u00e0 infec\u00e7\u00e3o por \n\nMeloidogyne incognita em mais de 90 % das amostras. Entre os v\u00e1rios mecanismos \n\npropostos para explicar o efeito protector dos FMA, destaca-se o aumento no vigor da \n\nplanta resultante da coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o micorr\u00edzica, e a competi\u00e7\u00e3o por espa\u00e7o e compostos \n\nfotoss\u00edntetizados que se estabelece entre o FMA e o nem\u00e1tode. \n\nCom base neste estudo podemos concluir que: quer a diversidade de esporos de \n\nFMA, como a diversidade de FMA que colonizam as ra\u00edzes de H. lanatus n\u00e3o \n\ndependem da intensidade do sistema de maneio; no entanto, nos sistemas intensivos \n\nh\u00e1 uma tend\u00eancia para uma maior ocorr\u00eancia de certos FMA, especialmente os \n\npertencentes ao g\u00e9nero Glomus, assistindo-se por conseguinte a uma potencial perda \n\n\n\n17\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nda funcionalidade dos ecossistemas neste tipo de maneio do solo; a coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o das \n\ndiferentes estruturas micorr\u00edzicas foi mais elevada nas pastagens semi-naturais, e \n\nexibiu uma marca sazonalidade relacionada com a fenologia e metabolismo de \n\ncarbono da planta hospedeira, e com as condi\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas. A inocula\u00e7\u00e3o com FMA \n\nnativos aumentou significativamente a produtividade das plantas e toler\u00e2ncia \u00e0 \n\ninfec\u00e7\u00e3o por nem\u00e1todos galhadores \u2013 M. inc\u00f3gnita, mas todavia depende da \n\nespecificidade da planta hospedeira. Deste modo, os FMA poder\u00e3o desempenhar um \n\npapel importante na funcionalidade dos ecossistemas, uma vez que o seu uso \n\nadequado poder\u00e1 reduzir a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de produtos qu\u00edmicos, bem como, os custos \n\nenerg\u00e9ticos na agricultura e consequentemente conduzir a uma agricultura mais \n\nsustent\u00e1vel e econ\u00f3mica. \n\n\n\n \n\nCHAPTER I.

An important group of mutualists are \n\nArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), an exceptional group of beneficial fungi. They are \n\npresent in most soils and are capable of forming associations with the root systems of \n\nthe great majority of plant species, where they act as bioregulators and protectors, and \n\nfacilitate the uptake of mineral nutrients (Smith and Read, 1997).  \n\n \n\n1.  The importance of soil microorganisms \n\nMuch of the terrestrial biosphere lives in the soil (Brussaard et al., 1997). Although soil \n\nprovides a physical substrate for almost all human activities, the study of soil biota \n\nremains relatively uncommon, especially in systems such as  conventional agriculture \n\nwhere soil is used exhaustively used (Whipps, 2001; Barea et al., 2005). This is \n\ninattention is partly to a lack of recognition of the role of soil biota on determining soil\u2019s \n\nchemical and physical properties and potential productivity (Whipps, 2001; Barea et \n\nal., 2005). In addition, knowledge of soil microbial diversity is partly limited by \n\ntaxonomic and methodological challenges associated with studying these organisms \n\n(Torsvik and \u00d8vre\u00e5s, 2002; Kirk et al., 2004). The soil organisms are not only \n\ninhabitants of the soil, but they are also integral parts of it; they influence such diverse \n\nproperties as hydrology, aeration and gas composition. These factors can have a \n\nmajor effect on primary production through the decomposition of organic residuals \n\n(Brussaard et al., 1997). The current shift toward sustainable land use, has contributed \n\nto an increasing awareness of soil biota among the planet\u2019s forms of life (Gianinazzi et \n\nal., 2008). Microorganisms\u2019 activities in the so-called \u201crhizosphere\u201d promote the \n\nestablishment, development, nutrition and health of plants, and are mutually, enabled \n\nby physical and nutritional support from the exudates of roots (Barea and Jeffries, \n\n1995). \n\nThere are three main groups of beneficial microorganisms in soil-plant systems, and \n\nthese groups are considered key to the sustainability of agro-ecosystems, namely: \n\nmycorrhizal fungi, N2-fixing bacteria, and plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0I_____________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0________________________________________________________\u00a0\u00a0____\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n22\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n(PGPR). N2-fixing bacteria contribute to the symbiotic fixation of atmospheric N, which \n\nrepresent the essential access of nitrogen (N) in ecosystems (Barea and Olivares, \n\n1998). Rhizobacteria which colonise the rhizosphere, are distinguished by their effects \n\nin promoting plant rooting and the biogeochemical cycling of plant nutrients (Barea, \n\n1997). Mycorrhizal fungi are ubiquitous plant mutualists that comprise a large fraction \n\nof fungal biomass in the rhizosphere. These symbiotic organisms are found inside \n\nroots, in the rhizosphere itself and in the bulk soil, and they interact in all these zones \n\nwith other organisms (Fitter and Garbaye, 1994; Azc\u00f3n-Aguilar et al., 2002). The \n\ninternal mycelium interacts principally with the root itself, though at the same time, it \n\ncan interact with other organisms and even with pathogenic fungi. The AMF external \n\nmycelium developed in the soil improve plant\u2019s nutrient and water uptake and, interact \n\nwith many organisms, such as bacteria, other fungi, protozoa, nematodes, arthropods \n\nand even large animal such as mammals (Fitter and Garbaye, 1994; Azc\u00f3n-Aguilar et \n\nal., 2002). In this  association, the obligate biotrophic fungi provides terrestrial plants \n\nwith minerals, nutrients (particularly inorganic phosphate) and water, increasing the \n\nhost resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, including pathogens, water limitation and \n\nenvironmental pollutants in exchange for photosynthates (Smith and Read, 1997).  \n\n \n\n2.  Mycorrhizal fungi  \n\nAmong favourable plant-microbe interactions, the mycorrhizal symbiosis is now known \n\nto be an essential component of any plant community due to the beneficial role of fungi \n\non plant growth and protection (Smith and Read, 1997). The term \u201cmycorrhiza\u201d was \n\nproposed for the first time in 1985 by the botanist A.B. Frank, to describe the peculiar \n\nassociation between tree roots and ectomycorrhizal fungi. It comes from the (Greek) \n\nmycos-rhiza, which means \u201cfungus-root\u201d. Fossil records from the Devonian of the first \n\nvascular plants show that arbuscular mycorrhizal associations were present in \n\nunderground rhizomatous structures, confirming the presence of this mutualistic \n\nassociation at least 400 million years ago (Remy et al., 1994). Evidence that the first \n\nland plants already possessed this association suggests that their aquatic ancestors \n\nalso harboured these fungi. Redecker et al. (2000) have documented spores from the \n\nOrdovician period (460 Ma) that are similar to present-day spores of Glomalean fungi, \n\nindicating that earlier associations with non-vascular plants were likely. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0I\u00a0\n\n23\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nMycorrhizal fungi are present in almost all terrestrial habitats from aquatic (Nielsen et \n\nal., 2004; Wolfe et al., 2006) ecosystems to deserts (D\u00edez et al., 2002; Shi et al., 2007) \n\ntropical forests (Husband et al., 2002; Mangan et al., 2004), at high latitudes and \n\naltitudes (Allen, 1991). It has been estimated that mycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic \n\nassociations with more than 85 % of plant species (Smith and Read, 1997). Only a few \n\nbotanic families as Crucifereae, Ciperaceae, Poligonaceae, Juncaceae and \n\nChenopodiaceae have non-mycorrhizal plant species (Brundrett, 2002; Peterson et al., \n\n2004). There is evidence that these nonmycotrophic groups may have mycorrhizal \n\nfungal invasions, though the physiological relationships are not well understood (Allen, \n\n1991; Peterson et al., 2004). \n\nSeven different categories of mycorrhizal symbiosis have been distinguished on the \n\nbasis of their morphological characteristics and the fungal and plant species involved, \n\nnamely: arbuscular mycorrhiza, ectomycorrhiza, ectendomycorrhiza, arbutoid \n\nmycorrhiza, monotropoid mycorrhiza, ericoid mycorrhiza and orchid mycorrhizas(Smith \n\nand Read, 1997; Peterson et al., 2004; Finlay, 2008). \n\n\u00a0\n\n3. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi \n\n Arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) belong to the phylum Glomeromycota, and form \n\nassociation with most of land plants (about 80-90%) (Smith &amp; Read, 1997). These \n\nfungi are obligate biotrophic symbionts, since they can only complete their life cycle in \n\nthe presence of their host plant. The main morphological characteristic of these fungi \n\nis the repeated dichotomous branching as they penetrate the cortical cells of the root \n\nto form of arbuscules, highly branched tree-like structures typical of colonisation \n\nstructures by these fungi. Initially, the fungus grows between the cortical cells, but it \n\nthen rapidly penetrates the host cell wall of the host and develops inside the cortical \n\ncells. \n\n In this type of association neither the cell walls of the fungus or the host cellular \n\nmembrane are ruptured. As the fungus develops, the host cellular membrane \n\ninvaginates and surrounds the fungus, forming a new compartment where material of \n\nhigh molecular complexity it is deposited (Bonfante &amp; Perotto 1995).This apoplastic \n\nspace prevents direct contact between the plant and the cytoplasm of the fungus, \n\nwhile allowing the transfer of nutrients between symbionts. Thus, arbuscules (Fig. 1) \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0I_____________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0________________________________________________________\u00a0\u00a0____\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n24\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nare the main sites of metabolite exchange and the primary physiological structures of \n\nthe symbiosis. They generally have a short life span (less than 15 days), after which \n\nthey degenerate, returning the cell to normal activity (Smith and Smith, 1990).Other \n\nstructures produced by some AMF include vesicles, auxiliary cells and asexual spores. \n\nVesicles are globose, inter- or intracellular, between 30 to 100 mm in size and rich in \n\nlipids (Fig. 1). Their primary function is to reserve organs, however, they can also \n\nserve as reproductive propagules for the fungus.  \n\nAll arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi form arbuscules, but some such as Gigaspora spp. or \n\nScutellospora spp., do not form vesicles. This observation underlies, the argument to \n\nchange the designation of \"vesicular\u2013arbuscular mycorrhiza\" to \"arbuscular \n\nmycorrhiza\" (Walker, 1995). AMF can produce auxiliary cells in the extraradical \n\nmycelium (Peterson et al. 2004; Smith &amp; Read 1997). Auxiliary cells are initiated as \n\nlateral branches that rapidly expand into globose structures of varying colour and with \n\nornamented walls. They can occur singly or in clusters. Auxiliary cells formed in the \n\nsoil may be \u201cnodulated\u201d or \u201ccoiled\u201d, and their function is unknown (Peterson et al., \n\n2004). Reproductive spores (Fig. 1) are produced on the extraradical hyphae, but they \n\ncan also grow within the colonised roots, e.g. for Glomus intraradices, Glomus clarum \n\nand Glomus fasciculatum (Schenck &amp; Smith 1982). Some AMF also form sporacarps \n\nor spore clusters (Redecker et al. 2007). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.

For \n\nthe establishment of the symbiosis, the key events in the life cycle of AMF are spore \n\ngermination and the pre-symbiotic mycelial growth phase, differential hyphal \n\nbranching, appressorium formation, root colonisation and arbuscule development \n\n(Giovannetti et al. 1994).  \n\nUnder favourable environmental conditions, the AMF spores germinate and the \n\nhyphae colonise susceptible roots (Smith and Read, 1997). AMF are able to \n\ndistinguish their hosts from other species, both non-mycorrhizal or non-arbuscular \n\nmycorrhiza through chemical of signals emitted by the roots to the fungus. These \n\nsignals promote a specific morphogenesis, of profuse hyphal branching and \n\nproliferation (Giovannetti et al. 1994). Among the compounds released in root \n\nexudates, flavonoids have been suggested to be involved in the stimulation of pre-\n\ncontact hypal growth and branching (Giovannetti and Sbrana, 1998). However, these \n\ncompounds are not strictly necessary for the establishment of mycorrhizal symbiose \n\n(B\u00e9card et al., 1995). Similar to the branching factors, which are produced by plants as \n\na compatibility signal for the fungus, the branched fungal hyphae produced a diffusible \n\nsignal to the roots (Kosuta et al. 2003). Thus, a \u201ccrosstalk\u201d between the plant and the \n\nfungus is established. \n\nAfter the recognising the host plant root, the hyphae form appressoria on the root \n\nepidermis (the root hair or other epidermal cell). AMF penetrate the root surface by \n\nenzymatic activity or mechanical force (Bonfante and Perotto 1995). The entry of the \n\nfungus is assisted by the plant by the establishment of a special cytoskeletal \n\narrangement, the prepenetration apparatus (Genre et al. 2005). The appressorium \n\nformation is followed by hyphal penetration of the cell lumen and proliferation of the \n\nintraradical hyphae in the upper cell layers of the root cortex. Furthermore, the hyphae \n\nenter the middle and inner cortex of the root. However, the fungus never enters \n\nmeristems or vascular cylinders, perhaps because of its inability to degrade suberin \n\nand lignin in the endodermal cell walls (Bonfante and Perotto 1995). When growing \n\ninside fungi are always surrounded by the intact plasma membrane of the plant host. \n\nIn the deeper cortical layers, the fungal hyphae may form arbuscules. As part of this \n\nintracellular development, the periarbuscular membrane where nutrient exchange \n\noccurs between the plant and the wall of the fungus, is formed from the plasma \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0I_____________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0________________________________________________________\u00a0\u00a0____\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n26\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nmembrane (Gianinazzi-Pearson, 1996). Once fungal colonisation has been \n\nestablished in the root, extensive growth of the extraradical mycelium (ERM) begins. \n\nThis is well adapted to the exploration of soil pores, mineral nutrient uptake and \n\nassociation with soil particles and, thus, stabilisation of soil aggregates. The ERM \n\nforms a complex network, that can link the roots of plants of the same or different \n\nspecies (Smith and Read 1997). The life cycle of the AMF is completed by the \n\nformation of spores or sporocarps on the ERM or rarely inside the roots. \n\n \n\n3.2. Paris- and Arum- type colonisation \n\nThere are three important components of any mycorrhizal root systems: the root itself \n\nand two associated mycelial systems, one within the root apoplast and the other in the \n\nsoil (Brundrett, 2004). The two mycelial systems grow and develop in diverse \n\nenvironments: the first it is very constant through root homeostasis, and the second is \n\nhighly variable. According to Gallaud (1905), depending on the species of plant, \n\nmycorrhizal colonisation can fall into one of two general anatomical groups, the Arum-\n\ntype and Paris-type (Figs. 2; 3). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.

Short side branches penetrate the cortical cells and branch dichotomously \n\nto produce characteristic arbuscules. Hyphal coils may be formed, particularly in the \n\nhypodermal (exodermal) cell layers of the root, but they are not usually a major \n\ncomponent of the intraradical mycelium (Smith and Read, 1997; Brundrett, 2004). In \n\ncontrast, in plants with Paris AMF associations (Fig. 3), colonisation of the roots is \n\ncharacterised by the extensive development of intracellular coiled hyphae that spread \n\ndirectly from cell to cell within the cortex. Arbuscules grow from these coils, and there \n\nis very little, if any, intercellular growth.  \n\nThe two AMF types differ not only in their morphology but also in the kinetics of root \n\ncolonisation. The development of Paris-type colonisation within the root is much \n\nslower than in the Arum-type organism (Azcon- Aguilar et al. 1994). However, the two \n\ntypes of colonisation have similar metabolic activity. Whereas arbuscules appear to be \n\nthe main site of P transfer to Arum-type (Ezawa et al., 2002), in the Paris-type, transfer \n\nmight occur in both hyphal and arbuscular coils (Van Aarle et al., 2005) \n\nThe type of AMF colonisation seems to be largely determined by the host plant \n\ngenotype, as the same AMF species known to form the Arum-type in some host plant \n\nspecies, and produces the Paris-type in other (Demuth and Weber 1990; Sykorov\u00e1 et \n\nal. 2003; Ahulu et al. 2006). \n\nFigure 3.

Ecology of Arbuscular Mycorrhizae \n\n3.3.1. Host specificity \n\nThe varying responses of plants to mycorrhizal infection have a profound impact on \n\nplant interactions and community structure. Depending on their response to \n\nmycorrhizal colonisation, plant species have been classified in three categories: \n\nobligate mycorrhizal, facultatively mycorrhizal or non-mycorrhizal, if they have high, \n\nintermediate or variable or no level of mycorrhizal association, respectively (Brundrett \n\nand Abbott, 2002; Brundrett, 2004). Obligate mycorrhizal plants are defined as those \n\nthat will not survive to reproductive maturity in their natural habitats without their \n\nmycorrhizal fungi, while facultatively mycorrhizal plants have intermediate \n\nassociations, where the plant\u2019s benefits are conditional on soil fertility.  \n\nExperiments have shown that these plants benefit from AMF only when soil P levels \n\nare relatively low. These plants typically have relatively long, narrow and highly \n\nbranched roots with long root hairs compared to obligately mycorrhizal species. \n\nFacultatively mycorrhizal plants apparently have the capacity to limit the extent of their \n\nassociations to reduce costs in cases where fungi provide little benefit (Koide &amp; \n\nSchreiner, 1992). Non-mycorrhizal plants have roots that are highly resistant to \n\ncolonisation by mycorrhizal fungi and do not form functional associations (Brundrett, \n\n2002; Brundrett, 2004).  \n\nThe responsiveness of plants to mycorrhizal colonisation further varies between \n\nspecies and cultivars and is markedly influenced by nutrient supply. This \n\nresponsiveness is frequently referred to as mycorrhizal dependency and expressed as \n\nthe percentage difference in dry matter between mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal \n\nplants grown in the same soil (Gerdemann, 1975). Responsiveness is strongly \n\naffected by both the capacity of the plant to absorb nutrients independently and its \n\ncapacity to support a heterotrophic symbiont with 'excess' photosynthate are important \n\nand may be genetically and environmentally influenced (Read and Smith, 1997). \n\nVariation in mycorrhizal dependency among species, have potentially important \n\napplications to agroecosystem functioning and management. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0I\u00a0\n\n29\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n3.3.2. Plant succession and mycorrhizal colonisation \n\nIn natural ecosystems, unrelated plant species with different nutrient uptake strategies \n\nand different AMF responsiveness occur together. Experimental evidence suggests \n\nthat warm-season perennial C4 grasses and perennial forbs are highly responsive to \n\nAMF colonisation (in terms of dry weight accumulation) and some even obligate \n\nmycorrhizal plants. Conversely, cool-season perennial C3 grasses and annual and \n\nbiennial forbs are both less responsive and somewhat less colonised (Wilson and \n\nHartnett, 1998). The responsive warm-season grasses normally have less fibrous root \n\nsystems, lower specific root length and a more plastic architecture than cool-season \n\ngrasses, and their degree of branching is reduced when they become colonised. All of \n\nthese characters are regularly associated with high responsiveness. Annual and \n\nbiennial species with lower responsiveness are often associated with disturbed \n\npatches where interspecific competition is relatively low. In these environments \n\ninvestment in finer roots with high turnover rates appears to be a more advantageous \n\nstrategy. Plant with facultative AMF status can presumably overcome occasional \n\nnutrient deficiencies and competitive stresses (Smith and Read, 1997). \n\nAMF can thus influence the dominant plants in a community by mediating competition \n\nbetween plants of differing mycotrophy (Grime et al. 1987; Wilson and Hartnett 1998; \n\nvan der Heijden et al. 1998; Hartnett and Wilson 1999; Eom et al. 2000; Hart et al., \n\n2003). This interaction can be extended to a model of succession where the \n\nmycotrophy of dominant plants changes as the community develops (Johnson et al. \n\n1991).  \n\nDuring primary succession only non-mycorrhizal pioneer plants can colonise, due to \n\nthe lack of AMF propagules which gives the advantage to these plants (Janos, 1980). \n\nDuring this time of dominance by non-mycorrhizal plants, succession may be slowed \n\nor completely arrested until the establishment of facultatively mycorrhizal plants begins \n\nto build a community of AMF. This period paves the way for the establishment of \n\nobligately mycorrhizal plants, which eventually dominate the community (Gemma and \n\nKoske1997). In this way, the mycotrophy of the dominant plants can be used to \n\nindicate the successional trajectory of a community (Reeves et al., 1979).  \n\nThere is evidence that AMF mediated sharing of nutrients (e.g., nitrogen and \n\nphosphorus) allows the survival of subordinate seedlings that act as nutrient sinks to  \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0I_____________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0________________________________________________________\u00a0\u00a0____\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n30\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nthe dominant source plants (Grime et al. 1987). It has also been suggested that \n\ninvasive plants can act as parasites, using the web of AMF to draw resources from \n\nnative vegetation (Marler et al. 1999). Whatever the case, it is clear that AMF affect \n\ncompetition and thereby influence the level of diversity found in plant communities. \n\nPlant diversity can either be increased or decreased by the presence of AMF \n\ndepending on the mycotrophy of the dominant species. Smith et al. (1999) reported \n\nthat removal of the dominant warm-season C4 grass species in a tall prairie, which \n\nexhibits high mycorrhizal responsiveness, increased plant diversity once the \n\nabundance of the dominant species declined in number, and subdominant cool-\n\nseason C3 grass and forb species increased in abundance. To generalize, increased \n\ndiversity and spatial heterogeneity of AMF will increase the diversity of plants when a \n\nvariation in host plant mycotrophy is present (van der Heijden et al. 1998; Hartnett and \n\nWilson 2002). The diversity of AMF is affected by the diversity of the plant community \n\n(Eom et al. 2000). Monocultures of mycorrhizal plants may have lower AMF diversity \n\nthan communities dominated by nonmycorrhizal plants (Johnson et al. 2004). While \n\nthis pattern may seem counterintuitive at first, it is analogous to the situation where \n\nAMF increase the competitive dominance of mycorrhizal plants in tall grass prairies \n\nand, thereby reduce the overall diversity of the plant community. The successional \n\nstatus of the plant community also dramatically impacts AMF communities, with AMF \n\ndiversity increasing along the successional gradient (Koske and Gemma 1997). \n\nFollowing the change in the level of diversity, there is a change in species \n\ncomposition, with a different group of AMF species represented in early and late \n\nsuccessional communities (Johnson et al. 1991). The endomycorrhizal relationship is \n\ntruly a two-way street; it is still unclear whether the AMF is the driver or the passenger \n\nin this relationship, or whether this distinction can be made (Hart et al. 2001). \n\n \n\n3.4. Genetics of AMF \n\nArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are obligate symbionts, and then only complete its life \n\nwhen associated to a compatible host. These fungi have an aseptate network \n\n(cenotytic) that enables them a quick drive cytoplasmic, facilitating the uptake of \n\nnutrients belonging to the depletion zone. Compared to others fungi, AMF have bigger \n\nspores, ranging between 22 and 1050 \u00b5m (Sch\u00fc\u00dfler et al., 1994).  \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0I\u00a0\n\n31\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nDepending of the species, these spores may have hundreds or thousands of nuclei \n\n(Bever and Morton, 1999; Pawlowska and Taylor, 2004). Hijri and Sanders (2005) \n\ncharacterised the size, complexity and ploidy of the genome of a strain of Glomus \n\nintraradices. Their results indicate this AMF is haploid and has a small genome of \n\napproximately 16.54 Mb, which is at the lower limit of eukaryotic genomes. However, it \n\nis important to emphasise that other glomeromycota showed genome larger than that \n\nof G. intraradices; like Gigaspora margarita has three times higher more nuclear \n\ncontent than Glomus versiforme (Bianciotto and Bonfante, 1992). Such differences in \n\ngenome size probably reflect differences in ploidy in addition to the, amount of \n\nrepetitive sequences. \n\nGlomeromycota probably follow an asexual reproductive cycle (i.e., clonal \n\nreproduction) by spore formation or by formation of a coenocytic (multinucleate) hypal \n\nnetwork. Only one case of sexual reproduction has been reported in Gigaspora \n\ndecipiens (Tommerup and Sivasitham, 1990), but never was truly confirmed. There is \n\nevidence of recombination among the Glomeromycota (Vandenkoornhuyse, 2001; \n\nLoBuglio and Taylor, 2002; Pawloska 2005). Molecular evidence suggests AMF is \n\nhaploid but there is some controversy about whether their genome structures is homo- \n\nor heterokaryotic. Two basic organizational structures have been advocated. First, it is \n\npossible that all intra-cellular variation is present within individual nuclei and all of the \n\nnuclei within a cell are identical, i.e., homokaryosis (Pawlowska and Taylor 2004; \n\nPawloska 2005). Alternatively, much of the genetic variation may be distributed \n\nbetween nuclei, with each cell containing multiple genomes, i.e., heterokaryosis (Bever \n\nand Morton 1999; Hijri and Sanders, 2005). These two scenarios have very different \n\nimplications for our understanding of the inheritance and maintenance of genetic \n\nvariation and maintenance of this genetic variation in AMF.  \n\nPawloska (2005) argued that according to non- Mendelian genetic systems and, based \n\non the heterokaryotic character of Glomeromycota (Sanders, 2002), these fungi must \n\nhave developed a nuclear recombination process, identical to the first steps of the \n\nparasexual cycle. The parasexual cycle is characterised by occurrence of \n\nanastomoses followed by nuclear change among species or individual genetically \n\ndifferent, but with vegetative compatibility. Initially, the parasexual cycle leads to \n\nheterokaryosis. However, heterokaryosis is an unstable condition; distinct nuclei fuse, \n\nresulting in a diploid nucleus that, may suffer chromosomal losses. These losses \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0I_____________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0________________________________________________________\u00a0\u00a0____\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n32\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\ncause a return to haploid status (Schardl and Craven, 2003), and consequent to the \n\nhomokaryosis.  \n\nThe genetic structure of AMF is currently a topic of intense discussion. Further \n\ninvestigation is necessary to understand the mechanisms by which different genetic \n\nfeatures shape the ecology, evolution and symbiotic efficiency of the Glomeromycota. \n\n \n\n4. Arbuscular mycorrhiza: \n\n4.1. Nutritional benefits \n\nSome of the most interesting and important questions about mycorrhizae concern the \n\nnutritional benefits that these symbioses confer to each participant. The symbiosis \n\nbetween AMF and autotrophic plants is generally regarded as mutualistic; the \n\nmutualism assumed as the bidirectional transfer of nutrients. With the exception of a \n\nfew achlorophyllous species, AM host plants are autotrophic and, although normally \n\ncolonised by mycorrhizal fungi in the field, they are usually capable of satisfactory \n\ngrowth in the absence of colonisation, if mineral nutrient supplies are adequate. In \n\ncontrast, AMF do not complete their life cycle in the absence of symbiosis with a host \n\nroot. This limitation gives some insight into the role of AMF and their contribution to \n\nnutrient absorption (Smith and Read, 1997). In the absence of a host root, AMF germ-\n\ntubes stop growing and do not produce new resting spores, even when large number \n\nof carbon (C) forms is added to the culture medium. One proposed explanation is that \n\nAMF experiences a failure or deficiency of the C metabolism in the asymbiotic state \n\nthus, understanding C metabolism in this stage of AMF development is of potential \n\npractical importance (Pfeffer et al., 1999; Bago et al., 2000). In the symbiotic \n\ninteraction, the fungus enters the inner cortical root cells to form specialised haustoria \n\ncalled arbuscules. There is increasing evidence that phosphate, translocated from the \n\nsoil through the fungus, is deposited at the arbuscular interface, where it is taken up by \n\nplant transporters. However, little is known about where the exchange of carbon takes \n\nplace (Pfeffer et al., 2001; Requena et al., 2003). \n\nThe assimilate transfer includes sucrose breakdown into glucose and fructose, their \n\nexport across the plant plasma membrane and their active uptake by hexose \n\ntransporters across the fungal plasma membrane, driven by an increased H+ -ATPase \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0I\u00a0\n\n33\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nactivity at the arbuscular membrane (Gianinazzi-Pearson et al. 2000). The function of \n\nH+ -ATPase is to generate the proton electrochemical gradient across the plasma \n\nmembrane that is required for effective cellular function. The, enzyme thus provides \n\nthe driving force for the uptake and efflux of ions and metabolites through an interface \n\notherwise impermeable to them and allows for the regulation of intracellular pH \n\n(Requena et al., 2003). The exchange of metabolites and ions across the plasma \n\nmembrane is particularly important at the symbiotic mycorrhizal interface because it \n\nenables the control of exchanged nutrients between the soil, fungus and plant \n\n\u201ccompartments.\u201d This exchanges maintains the equilibrium that defines the association \n\nas mutualistic and not as parasitic. In plants, H+ -ATPase is encoded by a large \n\nmultigene family (Gianinazzi-Pearson et al. 2000; Ferrol et al., 2002; Ezawa et al., \n\n2005) and may be recruited at different developmental stages to respond to the \n\ndifferent requirements of symbiosis (Requena et al., 2003). \n\nIn the fungal cytosol, the hexoses are converted into triacylglycerides or, amino acids \n\nor incorporated into glycogen pools. The major storage forms of carbon in spores and \n\nhyphae are lipids, trehalose and glycogen (Pfeffer et al. 1999). \n\nHyphae from colonised roots extend into the soil and aid root hairs in absorbing water \n\nand mineral nutrients. AMF are recognised for their ability to stimulate plant growth via \n\nenhanced uptake of phosphate despite its low mobility and availability in soil, and they \n\nthus play important roles in the terrestrial phosphorus cycle (Ezawa et al., 2002). In the \n\nsymbiotic phase, AMF take up inorganic phosphate (Pi) from the soil through fungal \n\nphosphate transporters, which in an extensive network of extraradical hyphae is \n\nrapidly converted into inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) and transported into the \n\nintraradical hyphae (Ezawa et al., 2004). In the arbuscules, polyphosphate is \n\nhydrolysed by enhanced phosphatase activity and released into the periarbuscular \n\nspace (Ohtomo and Saito 2005). Phosphate is then taken up by the plant through a \n\ntransmembrane transporter. As with carbon, the uptake of phosphate and other \n\nnutrients by arbuscular plant cells may be linked to the high plant and fungal H+- \n\nATPase activity observed at the periarbuscular membrane (Gianinazzi-Pearson et al. \n\n2000). Although most of the nutrient transfer between the two symbiotic partners takes \n\nplace in the arbuscules, they do not seem to be the sole site of nutrient exchange (Van \n\nAarle et al., 2005). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0I_____________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0________________________________________________________\u00a0\u00a0____\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n34\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n4.2. Other beneficial features  \n\n This symbiosis is characterised by the bidirectional flow of nutrients. The plant \n\nthrough the compounds photosynthates promotes the growth and reproduction of the \n\nfungus. In turn, the fungus enhances the uptake of water and nutrients, especially \n\nimmobile nutrients like phosphorus that are present beyond the depleted zones that \n\ndevelop around plant roots (Allen, 1991; Smith &amp; Read, 1997).  \n\nHowever these fungi can also provide many other benefits to the host including: \n\nincreased resistance to foliar-feeding insects through a reduction in the palatability of \n\nplant tissues, alteration in nutritional quality, or increase in the concentrations or types \n\nof defence compounds in the plant tissue (Gange and Weast, 1994; Master and \n\nBrown, 1997; Borowicz, 1997; Gange et al., 1999; Goverde et al., 2000; Wearn and \n\nGange, 2007). AMF colonisation may also lead to an increased in overall plant fitness \n\nand resistance against nematodes (de la Pe\u00f1a et al., 2006; Rodriguez-Romero et al., \n\n2005; Rodriguez-Echeverria et al., 2009) and pathogens (Smith et al., 1999; \n\nKlironomos et al., 2000; Idoia et al., 2004). These effects can, to a certain extent, \n\nreduce the need for pesticides and other synthetic chemical in agricultural practices. \n\nAMF also improves crops\u2019 tolerance of abiotic stresses, such as drought (Aug\u00e9 et al., \n\n2001). The resistance to water stress is likely associated with the extraradical network \n\nof hyphae which are far more resistant to drought than fine roots and can resume \n\ngrowth immediately after drought conditions cease (Miller et al., 1995). AMF can also \n\nincrease tolerance to salinity and heavy metals (Al-Karaki et al., 2001; Mohammad et \n\nal., 2003). Furthermore, AMF contributes to soil aggregation not only through the \n\ndevelopment of hyphal network builds into a macroporous structure that facilities \n\ncirculation of water and air and prevents erosion but also through the action of \n\nglomalin, a glycoprotein produced AMF (Rilling et al., 2003; Piotrowski et al., 2004; \n\nCavagnaro et al., 2006; van der Heijden et al., 2006). Another important role of AMF is \n\ntheir contribution as drivers of plant community composition (Grime et al., 1997; \n\nWilson and Hartnett, 1997; van der Heijden et al., 1998; Hartnett and Wilson, 1999). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0I\u00a0\n\n35\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n5. Identification, systematic, phylogeny and diversity of the Glomeromycota \n\n5.1. Systematics and phylogeny of the Glomeromycota \n\nBefore 1974, most of AMF were included in the genus Endogone, until Gerdemann \n\nand Trappe (1974) placed them in four different genera in the order Endogonales: \n\nGlomus, Sclerocystic, Gigaspora and Acaulospora. Previously, AMF had been \n\nassigned to the order Glomales, which included six genera and in the phylum \n\nZygomycota (Morton and Benny 1990). The Zygomycota is no longer accepted as a \n\nmonophyletic clade. However, based on their obligate symbiotic habit, the apparent \n\nlack of zygospores (i.e., spore produced through the conjugation of specialised hyphae \n\nduring sexual reproduction) and the DNA ribosomal (rDNA) phylogeny, Sch\u00fc?ler et al. \n\n(2001) defined the phylum Glomeromycota as a sister clade of Basidiomycota and \n\nAscomycota. Glomeromycota currently comprises approximately 200 described \n\nspecies distributed among ten genera, most of which were defined primarily based on \n\nthe morphology of their spores or spore-bearing structures \n\n(http://www.lrz.de/~schuessler/amphylo/).  \n\nRecently, DNA sequences have also been used to describe some AMF taxa and their \n\nphylogenetic relationships (e.g. Schwarzott et al. 2001; Redecker and Raab 2006). \n\nHowever, the possible sequence variation within individuals makes it difficult to \n\ninterpret molecular community data when sequences are obtained from colonised \n\nplant roots, especially when studies were made on organisms that were not well \n\ncharacterised and correctly identified. As a result, about half of the described species \n\nare not actually known from their molecular characters, and some are barely known \n\nfrom morphology because of very poor descriptions and lack of definable type material \n\n(C. Walker personal communication). Hence, a conservative approach in the \n\nevaluation of phylogenetic analyses is advisable; e.g. such as defining a monophyletic, \n\nwell-supported sequence cluster as an AMF phylotype (i.e., sequence type). Presently, \n\nthe phylogeny of all genera of AMF is largely based on analyses of small subunit of the \n\nribosomal DNA gene (SSU rDNA). Although additional genes have begun to be \n\nsequenced from some taxa (e.g. Helgason et al. 2003; Corradi et al. 2004; Redecker \n\nand Raab 2006), phylogenetic hypotheses based on multilocus DNA sequence data \n\nhave yet to be incorporated into the AMF classification. Four orders, containing nine \n\nfamilies and fourteen genera have been described within the Glomeromycota (Figs. 4). \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0I_____________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0________________________________________________________\u00a0\u00a0____\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n36\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe largest genus within this phylum, Glomus, was originally defined by spore \n\nmorphology and formation and was later revealed by molecular data to be polyphyletic \n\n(Schwarzott et al. 2001). Therefore, this genus was divided into the following five \n\ngenera: Glomus, Paraglomus, Archaeospora (Morton and Redecker 2001), Pacispora \n\n(Oehl and Sieverding 2004) and Diversispora (Walker and Sch\u00fcbler. 2004).  \n\nSchwarzott et al. (2001) further analysed this largest genus of the AMF and \n\nestablished a new family structure by dividing the remaining Glomeraceae into the \n\nDiversisporaceae and Glomeraceae. The Glomeraceae family contain the subgroups \n\n\u201cGlomus group A\u201d (including e.g., G. intraradices, G. proliferum, G. clarum and G. \n\nmosseae; Fig. 5) whose members are the dominant and most diverse AMF in many \n\nfield sites (\u00d6pik et al. 2006), and \u201cGlomus group B\u201d (including e.g., G. claroideum, G. \n\netunicatum G. lamellosum; see Fig. 5) whose members are difficult to distinguish \n\nFig. 4.

Therefore, detailed microscopic analyses are required for the \n\nidentification of anatomical subtleties, such as spore wall layers. \n\nSpore formation has been an important criterion for the identification of genera. \n\nMembers of Glomus (Berch and Fortin 1984), Pacispora (Oehl and Sieverding 2004), \n\nDiversispora (Walker and Sch\u00fc?ler 2004), Ambispora (Walker et al. 2007) and \n\nParaglomus (Morton and Redecker 2001) develop spores by blastic expansion of a \n\nhyphal tip (glomoid spores). However in Ambispora, a second spore type occurs (even \n\nwithin the same \u201cdimorphic\u201d species) that is typical of Acaulospora (Gerdemann and \n\nTrappe 1974) and Archaeospora (A. trappei; Morton and Redecker 2001); a \n\nsporiferous saccule forms blastically at the hyphal tip, and the acaulosporoid spore is \n\ndevelops at the \u201csaccule neck\u201d (the side of the subtending hypha). Entrophospora \n\n(Ames &amp; Schneider 1979) develops spores directly from the saccule neck, not laterally \n\nbut within the subtending hypha (the entrophosporoid mode of spore formation). The \n\nfourth, gigasporoid, type of spore formation characterises both Gigaspora (Gerdemann \n\nand Trappe 1974) and Scutellospora (Walker and Sanders 1986). Spores are formed \n\nfrom a morphologically specialised bulbous base (25-50 ?m in size) that is continuous \n\nwith the structural spore wall. \n\nOther distinguishing characteristics besides of spores are the presence or absence of \n\nflexible inner walls and type of germination, which occurs through the hyphal \n\nattachment (e.g. Glomus) or through the spore wall. In the latter mode of germination, \n\ngerm tubes can arise from i) a germination orb (Pacispora);  ii) a germination shield \n\n(Scutellospora) a structure that is occurs before spores germinate by penetrating the \n\nspore wall; or iii) a warty layer, typical for Gigaspora. The mode in which the spore is \n\nformed on the hypha (\"mode of spore formation\") has been an important criteria for \n\ndefining genera and families; the number of walls, the structure of their layers and \n\nornamentation have been used to distinguish species (Walker, 1983). Although these \n\ncharacteristics may be specific, they can differ according to environmental conditions \n\nand by the stage of the spore. Aged, dry or decaying spores can look different, even if \n\nthey belong to the same species.

Walker, \n\npersonal communication). \n\nGeosiphon pyriformis is a glomeromycotan species belonging to the order \n\nArchaeosporales. It is the only fungus in the Glomeromycota currently known to form a \n\nsymbiosis with a cyanobacterium: it produces bladders that harbor symbiotic Nostoc \n\npunctiforme (Sch\u00fc?ler et al. 1994). Despite its different morphology and life strategy, \n\nmolecular phylogenetic analysis has shown that Geosiphon is a member of the \n\nGlomeromycota (Schwarzott et al. 2001). \n\n \n\n6. Methods for AMF identification \n\n6.1. Morphological methods  \n\nBreakthroughs in AMF taxonomy were obtained after the taxonomic reviewed of \n\nEndogonaceae by Gerdemann and Tappe (1974). These authors not only restructured \n\nthe relationships of genus and family but also established a basis for species \n\nidentification and description. Previously to identify AMF such characteristics as \n\npresence of a subtending hypha, colour, diameter, and the presence of inner walls \n\nwere used. However, Walker (1983) introduced the concept of \u201cmurographs\u201d to \n\ndescribe and compare the layered structure of spore walls more easily. Thereafter, the \n\ndescriptions of new AMF followed this methodology, but when they did not easily fit the \n\n\u201cmurographs\u201d concept, the new AMF species found were described by others authors \n\n(Morton 1986; Walker, 1986; Spain et al., 1989). The AMF identification is still based \n\non the patterns described by Walker (1983). Morton (1988) extensively reviewed the \n\nconcepts and characters used in AMF identification. The way the spore is formed on \n\nthe hypha has been an important criterion with which to circumscribe genera and \n\nfamilies, and the layered structure of the spore walls is used to distinguish species. \n\nHowever, despite the progress in AMF taxonomy, many species were described \n\nbefore the formulation of these traditional taxonomic concepts; thus, additional \n\ndescription of these taxa is necessary to decrease the challenges of found on \n\nidentification (Walker, 1992). \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0I_____________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0________________________________________________________\u00a0\u00a0____\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n40\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nA new model of AMF description based on spore ontogeny was proposed (Franke and \n\nMorton, 1994; Bentivenga and Morton, 1995; Morton, 1995; St\u00fcrmer and Morton, \n\n1997; 1999). According to this model, the wall of the spore is divided into two main \n\ngroups:  the \u201cstructural wall\u201d and \u201cgerminal wall\u201d, and each group bis subdivided into \n\nlayers. Despite its complexity, the ontogenic method is more coherent and logical. In \n\naddition, the morphology of the spore, and the vegetative structures, can be used on \n\nthe family identification of some genera. However, traditional studies on AMF have \n\nshowed methodological limitations. Taxonomic identification of AMF spores collected \n\ndirectly from the field is quite difficult because they are often unidentifiable due to \n\ndegradation or parasitism by other organism. AMF are obligate symbionts, thus they \n\ncannot be cultivated in the absence of their host. Catch plants are often used to \n\nproduce identifiable spores (Bever et al., 2001). Although useful for the isolation and \n\npropagation of some AMF species, this indirect culture strategy is time-consuming. It \n\nalso introduces biases by plant preferences for particular AMF species, different \n\ngrowth conditions and other environmental factors. These limitation hinder its \n\nsuitability in characterising AMF communities (Jansa et al., 2002; Oehl et al., 2003). \n\nFurthermore, mycorrhizal root colonisation and spore numbers (Clapp et al. 1995) \n\nmight not reflect AMF populations in the soils, but only the sporulation stage of the \n\nAMF life cycle (a dormant phase) rather than activity within a symbiosis. This result of \n\nthe fact that not all AMF present as spores form active mycorrhizas and many taxa \n\npresent in the roots may not be sporulating. Moreover, fungal spore diversity differs \n\nseasonally, with some fungi sporulating in late spring and others at the end of summer. \n\nIn most cases, taxonomic identification to the species level thus requires a very \n\nexperienced investigator. \n\nHowever, an advantage of analysing spore numbers and morphology is that they can \n\nindicate over longer time periods (e.g., over months) the structures of the AMF \n\ncommunity (Douds and Millner,1999; Oehl et al. 2003) with the exception of putative \n\nnon-sporulating AMF species. Additionally, extracting spores from the soil can be done \n\nrapidly, and it may reveal taxa not easily detected by molecular methods, and provided \n\nthe user has reasonable taxonomic expertise. Intensive soil sampling, including the \n\nuse of successive trap culturing, typically takes much longer but reveals significantly \n\ngreater diversity than \u2018one-off\u2019 methods of spore extraction (Oehl et al., 2004).  \n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0I\u00a0\n\n41\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n6.2. Molecular methods  \n\nMolecular methods allow the AMF to be identified in the host plant roots or directly in \n\nthe soil. However, because Glomeromycota are obligate symbionts, it is difficult or \n\neven impossible to obtain their pure biomass, which is necessary for the development \n\nof molecular markers. Only some AMF can be cultivated in sterile conditions using \n\ntransformed plant roots (Fortin et al. 2002), while others must be cultivated in non-\n\nsterile greenhouse pot cultures (Oehl et al. 2005) or are probably completely non-\n\ncultivable or non-sporulating. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that AMF spores \n\nor sporocarps from filed or trap cultures can host numerous non-Glomeromycotans \n\nincluding other fungi and bacteria (Hijri et al., 2002).  \n\nMolecular markers have been employed to characterise AMF communities genetically. \n\nMolecular markers include: i) analysis of isoenzymes (Sander et al., 1992); ii) and; \n\nanalysis of the genomic profile of the rDNA (ribosomal DNA) (White et al., 1990; \n\nLanfranco et al., 2001) and mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) (Bruns et al., 1991). Most \n\nmolecular research investigating AMF identification and detection at species and \n\nisolate level has used techniques based on PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), which \n\nallow the characterisation of nucleic acids from small amounts of fungal DNA (White et \n\nal., 1990). These molecular techniques include: RAPD (Random Amplified \n\nPolymorphic DNA) (Wyss and Bonfante, 1993), RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length \n\nPolymorphism) (Sanders et al., 1995; Helgason et al., 1998; Redecker, 2000; Appoloni \n\net al., 2008), DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis) (Kowalchuk et al., \n\n2002; Ma et al., 2005; Santos et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2007) and qRT-PCR \n\n(Quantitative real-time PCR) (Alkan et al., 2004; 2006; Jansa et al., 2008). \n\nAll molecular tools described above have proven to be useful tools for characterizing \n\nthe AMF community, and in the future they could be combined with avaible \n\nmorphological tools to yield a better understanding of AMF community structure \n\n(Redecker et al., 2003). However, these molecular tools are costly and time-\n\nconsuming, and they lack sufficient sensitivity to quantify AMF (Oehl et al., 2004; \n\nEgerton-Warburton et al., 2007). Hijri et al. (2006) noted that not all AMF taxa present \n\nas spores were detected in roots by PCR, probably because not all taxa were \n\nsymbiotically active at the time or because they colonised the roots at levels below the \n\ndetection threshold. There is, still uncertainty as to whether there are other AMF \n\npresent that remain undetected because they are occur infrequently in intraradical \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0I_____________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0________________________________________________________\u00a0\u00a0____\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n42\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nstructures, or if there are other reasons why techniques still partly fail (Oehl et al., \n\n2004; 2010). \n\n \n\n6.2.1. Marker genes for AMF community studies \n\nSince Clapp et al. (1995) initiated field studies using molecular tools, several different \n\nmolecular markers have been developed; improvements are still nede and in \n\ndevelopment. Target genes are the nuclear-encoded small subunit (SSU) ribosomal \n\nRNA sequences (Helgason et al. 1998), and the large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA \n\nsequences (Van Tuinen et al., 1998; Kj\u00f8ller and Rosendahl 2000; Wu et al. 2007). The \n\npolymorphism of the latter is higher and, LSU is therefore more suitable for the \n\ndevelopment of group-specific primers (Rosendahl 2008; Robinson-Boyer et al. 2009). \n\nThe first designed AMF-specific-primer, the VANS1 primer for the 5\u2019 end of the SSU \n\n(Simon et al,. 1992), does not amplify all glomeromycotan lineages (Clapp et al., \n\n1995). Helgason et al. (1998) designed the AM1 primer, which in combination with the \n\nuniversal primer NS31 amplifies the variable central region of the SSU. However, it \n\ndoes not amplify this region in Archaeosporaceae, Paraglomeraceae or Glomus group \n\nB. \n\nIn another approach, Lee et al. (2008) developed the primer pair AML1/AML2 which \n\ntargets the SSU and claimed that this marker detects all published AMF sequences in \n\nthis gene region except for Archaeospora trappei. Generally, the resolution of \n\nphylotypes from this gene region is lower than in approaches using internal transcribed \n\nspacers (ITS). Several markers targeting the ITS have been developed and applied in \n\nfield studies. For example, Renker et al. (2003) used a nested PCR for the ITS with an \n\nintermediate restriction digest, designed to prevent the amplification of other fungi than \n\nAMF that contain the restriction site. However, in a later publication, these authors \n\nclarified that the restriction digest misses certain AMF species in the detection \n\nprocedure (Hempel et al. 2007).  \n\nFurthermore, this method amplified yeast species relatively frequently, which \n\nparadoxically allowed investigation of the biodiversity of basidiomycete yeasts \n\ninhabiting AMF-colonised roots or AMF spores (Renker et al. 2004). Other authors \n\nhave constructed primers targeting the LSU of rDNA (Kjoller and Rosendahl 2000; \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0I\u00a0\n\n43\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nGollotte et al. 2004). Similar to the AM1/NS31 primer pair, these primers also amplify \n\nonly a subset of the Glomeromycotan taxa. \n\nTo reduce the risk of missing AMF species in plant roots, Redecker (2000) developed \n\ngroup-specific nested PCR approaches for the SSU-ITS, covering all families of the \n\nGlomeromycota. Like the approach of Renker et al. (2003), this method was applied in \n\nseveral studies (Wubet et al., 2003; Hijri et al. 2006; Appoloni et al., 2008). \u00d6pik et al. \n\n(2006) and Robinson-Boyer et al. (2009) summarised several of these studies using \n\ndifferent target genes mentioned so far. It is obvious that all of these approaches have \n\ntheir advantages and disadvantages. The best approach depends on the scientific \n\naim, e.g., if a resolution on the genus or species level is required.  \n\nRecently, Kr\u00fcger et al. (2009) developed a nested PCR approach to overcome several \n\nof these problems. To avoid the need for several PCR reactions to detect all members \n\nof the Glomeromycota, mixed primer sets were used in the same reaction and \n\nsuccessfully tested against several members of AMF families spanning the whole \n\nphylum. The target fragment includes all ribosomal gene regions that have been \n\nbroadly used in other studies, resulting in approximately 1800 bp in the first and 1500 \n\nbp in the second PCR. Therefore, this approach permits comparison with previous \n\nstudies on the same taxonomic level. In particular, the SSU fragment allows broad \n\nphylogenetic analyses, as this gene region exists in the majority of different AMF taxa \n\n(Rosendahl 2008). The ITS region allows resolution to the species level. However, his \n\napproach has still to be tested intensively under field conditions as possible primer \n\nmatches have been found in other fungi and plants, even though no misamplifications \n\nwere observed in few initially tested environmental samples (Kr\u00fcger et al., 2009).  \n\nThe approach of Kr\u00fcger et al. (2009) might lead to considerable sequence information \n\nabout many unknown AMF taxa from various environments.  \n\n \n\n7. AMF and Agriculture \n\nAgricultural practices have dramatic impacts on soil and soil organisms, and AMF are \n\nno exception. Several studies have shown that agriculture reduces the diversity of the \n\nAMF community (Helgason et al. 1998; Daniell et al. 2001; Oehl et al. 2003). This \n\nreduction has been attributed to physical disturbance from tilling (Kabir et al., 1997; \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0I_____________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0________________________________________________________\u00a0\u00a0____\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n44\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nJansa et al., 2003), the effects of supplemental fertilisers (Linderman and Davis 2004) \n\nand the use of fungicides and soil fumigants (Menge 1982).Tillage has been shown to \n\nhave a significant influence on AMF colonisation (Douds and Miller, 2000; Jansa et al., \n\n2003; Schalamuck et al., 2006; Garcia et al., 2007). The extra-radical network of AMF \n\nmycelium functions as both the nutrient absorbing organ of mycorrhizae and as \n\ninocula for the colonisation of new roots. Thus, disruption caused by tillage can result \n\nin delayed or reduced root colonisation, and a decrease in the soil volume exploited by \n\nthe AMF which may affect nutrient uptake by mycorrhizae (Evans and Miller, 1990; \n\nBoddington and Dodd, 2000). Moreover, tilling transports hyphae and colonised root \n\nfragments to the upper soil layer, decreasing and diluting their activity as viable \n\npropagules for subsequent crops. A potentially opposing effect is that phosphorus (P) \n\nuptake is generally increased with tillage, due partly to an improved distribution of P \n\nand increased P availability (Borie et al., 2006; Garcia et al., 2007). Not only \n\nagricultural practices such as tilling and fertilising cause a decline in AMF diversity; but \n\nthere is also substantial evidence that they produce a shift in the composition AMF \n\ncommunity (Boddington and Dodd 2000; Egerton-Warburton and Allen 2000; Jansa et \n\nal., 2003). Evidences suggests a homogenisation of AMF community structures under \n\nhigh-input fertiliser systems, which tend to be dominated by generalist AMF species \n\nsuch as Glomus, due to their large ecological plasticity to support disturbed systems. \n\nThis plasticity could be related to differences in propagative units between the \n\nglomalean families (Hart and Reader, 2002; Jansa et al., 2003; Castillo et al., 2006). \n\nConversely, the non-Glomus species have a tendency to inhabit niches characterised \n\nas specialist as they are only present in specific soil types preferentially organic soils \n\n(Oehl et al., 2010). \n\nHowever, these agriculturally adapted AMF have been shown to be slower to infect, \n\nfaster to sporulate, and to produces fewer arbuscules (Johnson 1993; Scullion et al., \n\n1998; Oehl et al., 2003). These findings all suggest that the altered AMF community is \n\ndraw more resources from the plant while providing less in return.

An extreme pH (Clark et al., 1999; Ezawa et al., 2001; Khanam \n\net al., 2006) may also create conditions in which AMF confers for little or no benefit to \n\nthe host plant. Some AMF species (e.g., Glomus) prefer alkaline and neutral soil, while \n\nothers (e.g., Acaulospora) sporulate more abundant in acid soils (Gai and Li, 2003). \n\nAlso Oehl et al. (2010) reported that pH had a strong influence on AMF species genus \n\nand on the relative density of Glomus species. In addition to affecting plant \n\nperformance, these factors also influence the host\u2019s plant dependency on AM \n\nsymbiosis and the level of root colonisation.  \n\nGrazing has also been found to dramatically reduce AMF colonisation and spore \n\ndensity (Gange et al., 1993; Gehring et al., 1994; Lugo and Cabello, 2002; Dhillion and \n\nGardsjord, 2004). This trend may be due to a decrease in leaf area and an increase in \n\nroot/shoot ratio resulting in a decreased source capacity to satisfy root and AM fungi \n\nsink demands. \n\n \n\n8. Study areas \n\n8.1.1. Island overview \n\nThis study was conducted in the Terceira Island, the third island of the Azorean \n\narchipelago in terms of size (402 km2). Terceira is a roundish island formed by four \n\nmain volcanic complexes (Serra de Santa B\u00e1rbara, Serra do Mori\u00e3o, Pico Alto and \n\nSerra do Cume) (Zbyszewski et al., 1971). The highest point (Serra de S. B\u00e1rbara, \n\n1023 m) is simultaneously the most recent of the three major island\u2019s complexes of \n\n0.025 Ma B.P. (Martins, 1993). The eastern flatted part of the island is its older part of \n\nabout 3.52 My (Borges et al., 2009). Recent historical volcanic activity is evident in the \n\nwestern part of the island, where several well preserved lava tubes and volcanic \n\nchimneys are present (Borges et al., 1993). The Azores archipelago have a temperate \n\noceanic climate characterised by high levels of relative atmospheric humidity that \n\ncould reach 95% at high altitude native forests and ensures slight thermal variations \n\nthroughout the year (Azevedo et al., 1999). The average temperature is 17.5\u00b0 C in low \n\naltitudes, while the maximum temperature is in August and minimum in February \n\n(Azevedo, 1996). The pluviometric regime reaches its peak in January-February and \n\nminimum and July (Azevedo, 1996): Angra do Hero\u00edsmo (47 m): 969 mm year (140 \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0I_____________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0________________________________________________________\u00a0\u00a0____\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n46\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nmm in January and 40 mm in July) and Serra de S.

Studied pastures \n\nThe sampling areas were cattle-grazed upland pastures of two different types: semi-\n\nnatural pastures (managed for more than 50 years, with a higher diversity of grasses \n\nand forbs; see Borges and Brown 2001) and intensive pastures (managed for more \n\nthan 20 years, characterised also by a poor vascular flora of five or less dominant \n\nspecies).The semi-natural pastures are included in a site of communitarian interest \n\n(SIC- Serra de Santa Barbara e Pico Alto) inside of Rede Natura 2000: Pico Galhardo \n\n(PX) (Latitude 38\u00ba 41\u2019 51.71\u2019\u2019 N; Longitude 27\u00ba 13\u2019 25.34\u2019\u2019 W) and Terra Brava (TB) \n\n(Latitude 38\u00ba 41\u2019 59.74\u2019\u2019 N; Longitude 27\u00ba 12\u2019 41.37\u2019\u2019 W) (Fig. 6). \n\nThese pastures show a high floristic diversity, and they are dominated by the grasses \n\nHolcus lanatus and Agrostis castellana, perennial grasses that covers around 100% of \n\nsites (Dias, 1996; Borges, 1997). Frequently present in these pastures are also other \n\ngrasses like Anthoxanthum odoratum, Lolium multflorum, Holcus rigidus and Poa \n\ntrivialis and spontaneous species without forage value as: Lotus uliginosus, Rumex \n\nacetosella ssp. angiocarpus, Potentilla anglica, Hydrocotyle vulgaris, Plantago \n\nlanceolata, Lobelia urens, Cerastium fontanum, Conyza bonariensis, Anagallis \n\narvensis, Hypochoeris radicata, Ranunculus repens, Pteridium aquilinum, Juncus \n\neffusus (Dias, 1996; Borges, 1997).   \n\nThe intensive pastures are included on exotic forest of Eucalyptus. Agualva 1(RP1) is \n\nlocated at: Latitude 38\u00ba 45\u2019 27.18\u2019\u2019 N; Longitude 27\u00ba 11\u2019 41.55\u2019\u2019 W; and Agualva 2 \n\n(RP2) at: Latitude 38\u00ba 45\u2019 24.44\u2019\u2019 N; Longitude 27\u00ba 11\u2019 42.24\u2019\u2019 W (Fig. 6). In these \n\npastures the dominant grasses are usually Holcus lanatus and Lolium perenne (plant \n\ncover of 100%). Another species with high cover is Trifolium repens (Dias, 1996; \n\nBorges, 1997). In these pastures, other common species are: Plantago lanceolata, \n\nCyperus esculentus, Mentha suaveolens, Cerastium fontanum, Rumex \n\nconglomeratus, etc. (Dias, 1996; Borges, 1997). \n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0I\u00a0\n\n47\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPX\n\nTB\n\nRTP1\n\nRTP2\n\nFigure 6.

Land use history and soil management \n\n8.2.1. Land use in past \n\nAt the time of islands Human settlement, early colonizers have developed subsistence \n\ncrops, namely wheat and vegetables were produced, as well as, the cattle that, in \n\nmost cases, were released in native forest. The development of the islands Human \n\npopulation took place with these new European crops: sugar cane, pastel, wheat, wine \n\nand citrus fruits (Brito &amp; Poeira, 1991). Sugar cane cultivation was also tested in this \n\nperiod, but, unlike Madeira, the climatic conditions in the Azores, mild temperatures \n\nand high cloudiness, did not help to develop this culture and so, the agricultural \n\ntendency of the Azores was itself divided between the area sown to cereals (wheat, \n\nrye, barley) and pastures (Brito &amp; Poeira, 1991). Due to the small size of the islands \n\nand the high humidity levels of the cereal stubble, the livestock sector has been \n\ngradually adapting to the island environment (Armas, 1982).The cycle of cattle \n\nbreeding, milk production, dairy and meat persists since the 19th century. \n\nThe cultural system then was based on livestock and agricultural production in the \n\nrecent mobilized soils, so it can be considered as an agro-pastoral system, with a \n\nfocus on export and subsistence in areas of low to medium altitude. In higher altitudes, \n\nthe system consists in a silvopastoral, where the livestock left free in the middle of \n\nnatural vegetation in the forest, called the \"cria\u00e7\u00f5es\" (creations) or \"serra aberta\" (open \n\nmountain) as is known in Pico, Faial and Sao Jorge. On the island of Terceira, in these \n\nareas of open field, has been always created the wild cattle and goat cattle.  \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0I\u00a0\n\n49\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Azorean agriculture was based in the family system of land uses, relatively \n\nbalanced with the natural environment, which modulate a landscape of fenced fields \n\ndivided by stone walls, mostly in the lowland and medium altitude where soils are \n\nmore productive. The stone-walls are the first building structure of the organization of \n\nagrarian space, which consist in limited fields.  In the higher altitudes, the permanent \n\npastures are dominant, characterized by closed fields in large dimensions with wooded \n\nfencerows of Cryptomeria japonica, whose suitability of the soil is agro-forestry. In the \n\ncase of Terceira, this stratification is very clear: in the lowlands, from the coast to the \n\nmean average elevation of 200 to 300 m, the pastures are dominant in rotation with \n\ncorn; in the middle altitudes, the multi-sown and the spontaneous pastures (Gomes, \n\n2010); at higher altitudes (> 400 m), major permanent pasture fields (\u201cbacia leiteira\u201d) \n\nwith wooded Cryptomeria japonica fencerow, which is a communal lands, designated \n\nas \u201cbaldios\u201d under Forest Service administration (Gabriel, 1994).  \n\nIn lowland from the coastline up to 200 m, a period of dormancy of two months occurs \n\nduring the summer. Between 200 and 400 m, the grasslands do not present a cycle of \n\nvegetative dormancy, but an annual production of grass for 9 to 10 months. From 400 \n\nFigure 7.

In uplands (> 600 \n\nm) grass production is limited by a dormant period of at least 5 months, restricting it \n\nonly in summer (Oliveira, 1989). \n\n \n\n8.2.2. Land use today \n\nThe current Azorean farming system is based on a Ley farming ruled by rotations of \n\nsown grasses and leguminous pastures and corn crops for silage (Altieri, 1998). This \n\nsystem is based on multi-annual pasture (grasses and leguminous intercropping) with \n\na rotation of annual crops - corn for fodder during spring-summer and autumn such as \n\nLollium multiflorum Lam. and Avena sativa L., according to altitudinal zoning of land \n\naltitude and the season of the year. This farming system creates serious problems of \n\nsoil conservation, since it is unprotected during the winter, when the erosion is more \n\nintense (PRA, 2001). However, this system permits increase production levels with \n\nlittle annual and seasonal fluctuation in rotational grazing system with pasture, corn \n\nsilage, grass silage, bales and concentrates to ensure economic stability and comfort \n\nof farmers. \n\nAbout 83 % of utilized agricultural area of the Azores is occupied by pasture (Lopes, \n\n1999). According to North- American Land Use Land Classification, that was adapted \n\nto the Azores, and according to Pinheiro et al. (1987), there are seven classes, whose \n\nlimit of intensity increases from I to VII, and the first four classes correspond to arable \n\nland and the others to non-arable land.   In the case of Terceira Island, 45% of its soils \n\nare arable land (classes I to IV). \n\nWhen Portugal joined the European Union Market, in 1986, there was a gradual \n\nspecialization of the farming system from the traditional Azorean to the Ley farming \n\nsystem in detriment of other arable cultures, caused a deep impact on the economy \n\nand land use. In these islands with favorable soil and with weather conditions optimal \n\nfor the production of milk and meat, farmers faced a new and major challenge to \n\noptimize production to levels to reach the level of large agricultural or farming regions \n\nof northern Europe. The quota system of milk production imposed by EU as \n\nmembership served as a driving mechanism for the modernization of farms.  \n\nThe agricultural policy then, encouraged farmers to intensify production with the first \n\nCommunity Support Framework.

So, the first explorations of organic farming emerge together with a growing \n\nlocal market demand. On the other hand, the conventional agriculture is dominant, \n\nheavily dependent on imported inputs, such as fossil fuels, imported seeds of pasture \n\nand maize, fertilizers and specialized agricultural machinery, with increasing water \n\nconsumption by livestock due to increased stocking. Agri-livestock farms have been \n\ndeclining in number, but have been increasing its utilized arable superficies to meet \n\nthe technical requirements of the farming system and market. The closed fields tend to \n\nbe resized with the removal of stone walls between parcels and have increased the \n\nnumber of contiguous parcels. \n\nThe stocking rate average is 2.1 animals per hectare in the Azores.

Introduction \n\n \n\nAMF are ubiquitous, underground, symbiotic associations involving a wide diversity of \n\nplants (approximately 80%) and obligate symbiotic fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota \n\nthought to have originated 400\u2013500 million years ago (Sch\u00fclbler et al., 2001). In this \n\nintimate association the obligate biotrophic fungi provide terrestrial plants with \n\nminerals, nutrients (particularly inorganic phosphate) and water increasing the host \n\nresistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, including pathogens, water limitation and \n\nenvironmental pollutants in return for photosynthates (Smith and Read, 1997).  \n\nThese beneficial effects of AMF are important in natural ecosystems, although they \n\nmay be unimportant in high-input agriculture (Barea and Jeffries 1995; Galvez et al. \n\n2001). Clearly, agricultural practices such as the intensity of cultivation, the quality and \n\nquantity of fertilisers applied and the plant protection strategies used may have \n\ndramatic impacts on soil and soil organism, and the AMF community structure is not \n\nan exception (Sieverding, 1989; Douds and Millner, 1999; Oehl et al., 2003; Li et al., \n\n2007). \n\nThere have been some recent reports comparing the AMF community structures within \n\nfarming systems differing in management practices such as tillage, fertiliser input, \n\npesticide use and crop rotation (reviewed by Douds and Millner, 1999). Some \n\nagricultures practices, such as tillage and fertilisation, can affect the structure of \n\ncommunities causing a decline in AMF diversity and producing a shift in the AMF \n\ncomposition (Boddington and Dodd, 2000; Egerton-Warburton and Allen, 2000; Jansa \n\net al., 2002; 2003).  \n\nThe extra-radical network of AMF mycelium functions as both the nutrient absorbing \n\norgan of mycorrhizae and as inocula for the colonisation of new roots. Thus disruption \n\ncaused by tillage can result in delayed or reduce root colonisation, and a decrease in \n\nthe soil volume exploited by AMF which may affect nutrient uptake by mycorrhizae \n\n(Miller et al., 1995). \n\nIn addition, Jansa et al. (2002) reported that tillage affected significantly the community \n\nstructure of AMF, decreasing the sporulation of some non-Glomus like Gigaspora, \n\nScutellospora and Entrophospora in tilled treatment. \n\nAlso Oehl et al. (2004) found that differences between land use systems (conventional \n\nversus organic) did not only reflect in species richness but also in species composition. \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0II\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                                                                                                                                       \n\n   56\u00a0\n \n\nAlthough they have detected no change in abundance of Glomus species between \n\nland uses, the same pattern was not observed in relation to spore abundances of \n\nAcaulospora and Scutellospora species which were more abundant in organic \n\nsystems. These findings suggest that in high-input fertilisers systems tend to occur a \n\nhomogenisation of AMF community composition, almost dominated by AMF generalist \n\nspecies, since the non-Glomus species have a tendency to inhabit determinate niches \n\nbeing characterised as specialist as they are only present in specific soil types, \n\npreferentially organic soils (Oehl et al., 2010). It have been shown these agriculturally \n\nadapted AMF have slower rates of  infection, are faster to sporulate and to produce \n\nfewer arbuscules, the site of nutrients transfer to the host (Johnson, 1993; Scullion et \n\nal. 1998; Oehl et al. 2003). These findings suggest that the altered AMF community is \n\ndraw more resources from the plant while providing less in return. Thus, we could \n\nassist to a loss in AMF species diversity during agricultural use which may result in a \n\ndiminished biodiversity of the reestablishing plant community (Van der Heijden et al. \n\n1998). \n\nSoil types differ in soil chemical and physical characteristics. Recent works have \n\nshowed that pH (Ezawa et al., 2001; Oehl et al., 2010), nitrogen (N) (Jonhson et al., \n\n2003; Egerton-Warburton et al., 2007) organic matter (OM) (Boddington and Dodd \n\n2000) and phosphorous (P) availability (Oehl et al., 2004) influence the composition of \n\nAMF communities. It has been showed in several studies that pH it is an important \n\nfactor influencing the AMF species composition. Some AMF species (e.g., Glomus) \n\nprefer alkaline and neutral soil, while other (e.g., Acaulospora) sporulate more \n\nabundantly in acid soils (Gai and Li, 2003). Also Oehl et al. (2010) reported that pH \n\nhad strongly influence in AMF species genus and on relative density of Glomus \n\nspecies. Nitrogen (N) has also proved to be a preponderant factor in determining AMF \n\ncomposition via carbon (C) allocation. This way, N enrichment generally decreases \n\nallocation to AMF structure at the field site with ample soil, but it increases allocation to \n\nmycorrhizae at sites with P-deficient soils (Johnson et al., 2003). Extraradical \n\nstructures are more responsive to N enrichment than are intraradical. Hence, one time \n\nthat Gigasporaceae produce more extraradical hyphae than Glomacaeae and \n\nAcaulosporaceae, both Gigasporaceae spores and extraradical hyphae decrease with \n\nN-enrichment in high-P soil and the opposite occurred in low-P soils (Johnson et al. \n\n2003). \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0II\u00a0\u00a0\n\n  \n\n                                                                                                                                                   57\u00a0\n  \n\nOrganic matter (OM) is also susceptible to influence AMF composition via increase or \n\ndecrease the species abundance of some AMF. Zhang et al. (1999) reported that \n\nfrequency of occurrence of Glomus mosseae decreased with increasing OM content, \n\nwhile Glomus sinuosum and Glomus taiwanense were found only when soil organic \n\nmatter content was less than 1.5%.  \n\nSome authors have suggested that differences in AMF composition between \n\nconventional and organic systems can be explained by balance of nutrients applied \n\nwhich combined produce variables levels of soil P (Eason et al., 1999; Oehl et al., \n\n2004).  The largest effect of AMF is on P nutrition. It is well know that higher soil P can \n\nreduce AMF formation and the inhibition may be due to a direct effect on external \n\nhyphal growth or be indirect associated with host P status (Sanders, 1975). Glomus \n\ndue to its large ecological plasticity is generally the genus with greater number of \n\nspecies found in intensively management (Oeh et al., 2003; 2004). Johnson (1993) \n\ndetected an increase on relative abundance of Glomus intraradices in response in \n\nfertilisation witch classify it in P-tolerant, as well as, a decrease in relative abundance \n\nof Gigaspora gigantea, Gigaspora margarita, Scutellospora calospora and Paraglomus \n\noccultum. Also Bhadalung et al. (2005) showed that long-term fertilisation caused \n\ndecreases in AMF total spore numbers and also relative spore abundance varied with \n\nspecies and sampling time. They found a decreased in absolute number of species \n\nIntraspora scheckii, Glomus mosseae, Glomus sp.1, Glomus geosporum-like and \n\nScutellospora fulgida with fertilisation, which were classified as AMF species \n\ninsensitive to fertilisation.  \n\nDespite ecological importance of AMF community, little is known about their population \n\nbiology and diversity in natural ecosystems. Due to methological limitations, only about \n\n200 morphospecies were described. Inoculum of AMF in soil appears in three forms: \n\nspores, soilborne hyphae and colonised roots. Traditional studies on AMF diversity are \n\nbased mainly on spore morphology (Walker, 1992). However, taxonomic identification \n\nof AMF spores collected directly from the field is quite difficult because they are often \n\nunidentifiable due to degradation or parasitism by other organism, and thus do not \n\nnecessarily reflect the AMF populations in soil (Clapp et al., 1995). Adding, fungal \n\nspore diversity differs seasonally, with some fungi sporulating in late spring and others \n\nat the end of summer. \n\nHowever, an advantage is that spore numbers are indicators over a longer time period, \n\ni.e. over months, which allow us to described AMF community structures based on \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0II\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                                                                                                                                       \n\n   58\u00a0\n \n\nspore morphology (Douds and Millner,1999; Oehl et al., 2003), with the exception of \n\nputative non-sporulating AMF species. Providing the user has reasonable taxonomic \n\nexpertise, the extraction of spores from soil is a rapid method, and it may reveal taxa \n\nnot easily detected by molecular methods. Moreover, intensive soil sampling, including \n\nthe use of successive trap culturing, takes much longer but reveals significantly \n\ngreater diversity than a \u2018one-off\u2019 spore extraction (Oehl et al., 2004). Recently, \n\nalternative molecular methods have been developed (Clapp et al., 1995; Helgason et \n\nal., 1998; Redecker, 2000). These molecular tools have proved to be useful tools for \n\ncharacterising of the AMF community, and in the future could be combined with the \n\nmorphological tools available to a better understanding of AMF community structure. \n\nHowever, the molecular tools are costly and time-consuming, and AMF populations \n\ncannot as yet be quantified by these techniques, because they lack sufficient \n\nsensitivity detecting only the most abundant taxa (Oehl et al., 2004; Egerton-\n\nWarburton et al., 2007). Hijri et al. (2006) noted that neither all AMF taxa present as \n\nspores were detected in roots by PCR, probably because they were not symbiotically \n\nactive at the respective time or because they colonise the roots at levels below the \n\ndetection threshold. Then, it is still uncertain whether there are other AMF that remain \n\nundetected because their percentage of intraradical structures are low, or if there are \n\nother reasons for these techniques still partly to fail (Oehl et al., 2004). \n\n  \n\nThe Azores archipelago has an extended area of pastures (Martins, 1993) including \n\nnatural, semi-natural and intensive pastures (see Borges et al., 2008). Trough time, \n\nnative forests have been destroyed by human activities and replaced by agricultural \n\nland. These disturbances can significantly alter the proportion of mycotrophic versus \n\nnonmycotrophic plant species in a community, and consequently affect the dynamics \n\nof the AMF community and its sporulation patterns (Violi et al., 2008). After several \n\neconomical cycles, and some catastrophic experiences with different types of \n\nmonocultures (e.g. wheat Triticum spp.; \"Pastel\" Isatis tinctoria L.; orange-tree Citrus \n\nspp.) (Martins, 1993), during the second half of the 20th century cattle milk production \n\nhas grown in importance (Martins, 1993; Borges, 1997). In order to respond to the high \n\ndensity of cattle milk, pastures became the dominant landscape in the Azores \n\narchipelago, covering 67.7 % of the arable land, and there are also semi-natural \n\npasture comprising 11.2 % of the total area (Garcia and Furtado, 1991). Most semi-\n\nnatural pastures are located at high altitude in recent infertile acid volcanic soils (e.g. \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0II\u00a0\u00a0\n\n  \n\n                                                                                                                                                   59\u00a0\n  \n\nTerceira and Pico), or in more mature but still poor soils (e.g. S. Maria) (Borges, 1997). \n\nThe floristic composition of pastures is dominated by introduced grasses and \n\nleguminous forbs, while native forbs (e.g. Lotus uliginosus), grasses, rushes, sedges \n\nand ferns are more frequent in the poorly managed old semi-natural pasture (Borges, \n\n1997).  \n\nTo date, little is known about the diversity and composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal \n\nfungal (AMF) communities in this environment as affected by changing land use. \n\nTherefore, in this study we assessed the AMF community structure based on the \n\nclassic spore morphology characteristics in order to highlight both qualitative and \n\nquantitative differences in semi-natural and intensive pastures in Terceira Island \n\n(Azores).  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. Materials and methods \n\n2.1. Study sites \n\nThis study was conducted in the Terceira Island, the third island of the Azorean \n\narchipelago in terms of size (402 km2). Terceira is a roundish island formed by four \n\nmain volcanic complexes (Serra de Santa B\u00e1rbara, Serra do Mori\u00e3o, Pico Alto and \n\nSerra do Cume) (Zbyszewski et al., 1971). The highest point (Serra de S. B\u00e1rbara, \n\n1023 m) is simultaneously the most recent of the three major island\u2019s complexes of \n\n0.025 Ma B.P. (Martins, 1993). The eastern flatted part of the island is its older part of \n\nabout 3.52 My (Borges et al., 2009). Recent historical volcanic activity is evident in the \n\nwestern part of the island, where several well preserved lava tubes and volcanic \n\nchimneys are present (Borges et al., 1993). The Azores archipelago have a temperate \n\noceanic climate characterised by high levels of relative atmospheric humidity that \n\ncould reach 95% at high altitude native forests and ensures slight thermal variations \n\nthroughout the year (Azevedo et al., 1999). The average temperature is 17.5\u00b0 C in low \n\naltitudes, while the maximum temperature is in August and minimum in February \n\n(Azevedo, 1996). The pluviometric regime reaches its peak in January-February and \n\nminimum and July (Azevedo, 1996): Angra do Hero\u00edsmo (47 m): 969 mm year (140 \n\nmm in January and 40 mm in July) and Serra de S. B\u00e1rbara (1,023 m): 3,000 mm year \n\n(Borges, 1997).  \n\nThe sampling areas were cattle-grazed upland pastures of two different types: semi-\n\nnatural pastures (managed for more than 50 years, with a higher diversity of grasses \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0II\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                                                                                                                                       \n\n   60\u00a0\n \n\nand forbs; see Borges and Brown 2001) and intensive pastures (managed for more \n\nthan 20 years, characterised also by a poor vascular flora of five or less dominant \n\nspecies).The semi-natural pastures are included in a site of communitarian interest \n\n(SIC- Serra de Santa Barbara e Pico Alto) inside of Rede Natura 2000: Pico Galhardo \n\n(PX) (Latitude 38\u00ba 41\u2019 51.71\u2019\u2019 N; Longitude 27\u00ba 13\u2019 25.34\u2019\u2019 W) and Terra Brava (TB) \n\n(Latitude 38\u00ba 41\u2019 59.74\u2019\u2019 N; Longitude 27\u00ba 12\u2019 41.37\u2019\u2019 W) (Fig. 1). \n\nThese pastures show a high floristic diversity, and they are dominated by the grasses \n\nHolcus lanatus and Agrostis castellana, perennial grasses that covers around 100% of \n\nsites (Dias, 1996; Borges, 1997).

Soil analyses \n\nThe soils of semi-natural and intensive pastures are andossols and sandy-loam \n\n(Pinheiro, 1990). The soil analyses were performed only with soil samples collected in \n\nAugust 2007. The 10 samples of rhizospheric soil from each site were pooled and \n\nanalysed as a single sample. Chemical soil parameters for each soil are presented in \n\nTable 1. They were measured in the University of Azores Soil Laboratory (CITA-A), \n\naccording to standard methods. Potassium, calcium and magnesium were extracted \n\nwith sodium acetate (1/5) at pH 7, and were determined using a Varian ICP atomic \n\nemission spectrophotometer. Soil pH was determined on a soil/water paste (1/2.5) and \n\navailable phosphorus as described by Olsen and Sommers (1982) by extraction with a \n\n0.5 M NaHCO3 solution at pH 8.5, using AAS. Total soil nitrogen content was \n\nestimated using the Kjehldahl method (Allen, 1989). The organic carbon (OC) and \n\norganic matter (OM) present in the soil were estimated using the dry ashing method. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.5.

After one week of growth, seedlings were transplanted to pots \n\ncontaining the fresh soil samples mix. A total of 4 seedlings were used per plot. Trap \n\ncultures in 40 plots were grown in glasshouse for 5 months and then harvested. All \n\npots were watered every 2 days with distilled water, and no nutrient solution was \n\nadded to the pots. One month before harvested, we left watering the pots to stimulate \n\nthe sporulation. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.6. AMF spore extraction and identification \n\nSpores were extracted from each soil sample using a centrifugation technique \n\nmodified from that used for extracting nematodes from soil (Jenkins, 1964). A \n\nsubsample of about 50 cm3 was weighed and sieved (2 mm) to remove some debris \n\nand lumps. Next, the sample was placed in an erlemeyer (1000 mL) containing a \n\nsolution of sodium polyphosphate (NaPO3)n, stirred vigorously for 4 min on a stirrer \n\nand allowed to settle for 15 sec. Then, the supernatant was gently poured to a stack of \n\n1000-, 500-, 250-, 100-, and 45 \u00b5m sieves. This operation was repeated more than 2 \n\ntimes but it was used only distilled water as a solution. Then, we proceeded to the \n\ncollection of the material found in each sieve to two 50-mL plastic centrifuge tubes, \n\nand centrifuged for 5 min at 4000 r.p.m. on horizontal centrifuge. The supernatant was \n\ndiscarded and the tubes were filled with sucrose solution at a concentration of 480 g/ L \n\n(specific gravity, 1.18). Their contents were then stirred thoroughly and centrifuged for \n\n3 min at 3000 r.p.m. The supernatant was quickly poured onto a 38 \u00b5m sieve and \n\nFigure 2.

The material retained on this last sieve \n\nwas transferred to a 50-mL plastic centrifuge tube and stored at 4 ?C in autoclaved \n\ndistilled water until count could be made. After, tubes containing the spores were \n\ndischarged into a glass Petri plate (9 cm diameter), all spores were counted into at a \n\n2-mL plastic tube and stored at 4 ?C in autoclaved distilled. Next each plastic tube \n\ncontaining all spore extracted from each sample (a total of 40 samples) were sent to a \n\nspecialist, AMF spore in identification, Dr. Christopher Walker which made its \n\nmorphological identification.  \n\nSpecies description was based on recommendations of Dr. C. Walker, as well as, on \n\ncurrent species descriptions and identification manuals (International Culture \n\nCollection of Arbuscular and Vesicular-Arbuscular Endomycorrhizal Fungi \n\n[http://invam.caf.wvu.edu/Myc_Info/Taxonomy/species.htm]). \n\nThis work was a preliminary study of AMF diversity and composition only based on \n\nspecies extracted from trap culture, caused by low spore number, parasitism of \n\nspores, and age and environmental alteration of spores (e.g., discoloration) in field \n\nwhich could hinder accurate identification, Hence, it\u2019s probable that has occurred some \n\nbias from the use of this technique.  \n\nDiscrepancies between trap culture roots and field-collected roots are likely to be the \n\nresult of the conditions in the pot cultures, which may favor certain AMF taxa. \n\nConsequently, trap culture may provide a different picture of AMF communities than \n\nanalysis of field-collected roots. Such a difference in AMF species composition \n\nbetween trapping and direct spore extraction had been report in several studies \n\n(Brundrett et al. 1999; Oehl et al. 2003). Brundrett et al. (1999) found that most \n\nspecies of Scutellospora, Acaulospora and Gigaspora were obtained primarily from \n\nfield-collected spores, but only 50% of these culture attempts were successful. With \n\nGlomus, they found the opposite pattern. Several Glomus spp. rarely detected in field \n\nsoil were dominant in trap cultures. Oehl et al., (2004) reported three out of 35 species \n\nrecorded at a field site failing to produce spores in traps. Hijri et al. (2006) noted that \n\nParaglomus was never detected in trap cultures, although it occurred frequently in the \n\nfield site experiment. However, the opposite was observed by them in relation to \n\nArchaeospora trappei which only be detected in trap cultures. \n\nAlso Wang et al., 2008 found a distinct difference in AMF diversity in the two sets of \n\nintensively managed agricultural soil in Sichuan Province of SE China. Only five \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0II\u00a0\u00a0\n\n  \n\n                                                                                                                                                   65\u00a0\n  \n\nspecies out of thirty were detected both by direct extraction (soil set 2) from soil and by \n\ntrap culturing (soil set 1).  \n\nHowever, despite all limitations of trap culture it\u2019s know that identification of species at \n\na site and quantification of diversity, dominance, etc., actually it\u2019s limited to the \n\nsporulating species, and that non-sporulating species only can be detected via trap \n\nculture. The differences between isolation methods often is pronounced with \n\nprolonged (Oehl et al., 2003) or repeated trapping (Stutz and Morton, 1996). However, \n\nit is clear that several isolation methods should be used simultaneously to obtain a \n\nmore complete picture of the AMF species composition in soil. Brundrett et al. (1999) \n\nstudied four different techniques for isolating AMF, i.e. (1) spores separated from soil, \n\n(2) soil trap cultures, (3) root samples or (4) transplanted seedlings. They found that all \n\nthese techniques complemented each other because they often produced cultures \n\ndominated by different species from the same soil sample. \n\nFurthermore, although morphological identification of AMF is the most widespread \n\nmethod and in many cases still unavoidable, it should be carried out concomitantly \n\nwith other (e.g. molecular) methods for mutual confirmation. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.7. Data analysis \n\nSpore density, richness, occurrence and relative abundance were based on spore \n\nidentification extracted from the trap culture. The ecological parameters were \n\ncalculated as follows: i) spore density was expressed as number of fungal spores in 50 \n\ng dried soil; ii) relative of abundance was defined as the number of spore of a given \n\nspecie or genus divided by the total number of spores in each soil type; iii) frequency \n\nof occurrence was calculated as the number of samples from which particular species \n\nor genus were isolated; iv) species richness was defined as the number of AMF taxa \n\nfound in particular field site.  \n\nTo analyse the relatedness of sampling sites in respect of AMF species composition a \n\nhierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) using Ward\u2019s minimum variance method was \n\nperformance in CAP 4 (Community Analysis Package 4, CAP4), to determine the \n\nsimilarity (more precisely: dissimilarity) with respect to AMF species composition \n\nbetween land use, based on the ?2 distance. We also used Principal Correspondence \n\nin CAP 4, to study the contribution of each sampled site to the total variation based on \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0II\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                                                                                                                                       \n\n   66\u00a0\n \n\ntheir AMF species composition, as well as the contribution from each AMF species \n\nbased on their abundance along sampled sites. \n\nPearson correlations coefficients was calculated between chemical proprieties of each \n\nsoil type and the total AMF density, as well as between AMF spore density of the more \n\nrepresentative genera (Acaulospora, Glomus and Scutellospora).  \n\nThe sampling design was nested hierarchical, with field sites nested within land use \n\ntype. Then, to investigate the variation on species richness between land uses and \n\nbetween field sites within each land use we used Nested ANOVA (Minitab, version \n\n13.31, 2000). The same proceed was made to estimated the variation on total AMF \n\nspore density, and the variation on AMF spore density of the more representative \n\ngenera (Acaulospora, Glomus and Scutellospora) between land uses and between \n\nfield sites within each land use. All data were tested for normality when required to \n\nfulfil assumptions of the Nested ANOVA.  \n\n \n\n3. Results \n\n3.1.

AMF species composition \n\nThe number of species found at both land uses types was almost identical, as the \n\nsemi-natural and intensive pastures contained 24 and 28 AMF species respectively. \n\nThen, no significant differences was found between land uses (Nested Anova: F= \n\n2.44; d.f= 1. 2; p= 0.13) neither between field sites within each land uses (Nested \n\nAnova: F= 1.31; d.f= 1. 36; p= 0.28). \n\nHowever, the AMF species composition appeared to differ between both land uses. \n\nThe hierarchical cluster analyses showed that land use intensity was the dominating \n\nfactors which separated the similarities in AMF species composition between field \n\nsites (Fig. 4). The semi-natural sites with lower levels of land use intensity (PX; TB), \n\nare clearly separated clearly from intensives sites (RP1; RP2). \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0II\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                                                                                                                                       \n\n   78\u00a0\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe contribution of AMF spore abundance and land use type to the total variation in \n\nspecies composition was analysed via Principal Component Analyses (PCA) (Fig. 5). \n\nFigure 5 presents the biplot for the first and second PCA axes, which explained 76.2% \n\nof total variation.

In this way, Acaulospora sp. and Ambispora sp. were only \n\nobserved in the semi-natural land use (Fig. 5) while G. etunicatum and Paraglomus \n\nbrasilianum was only found in the intensive ones (Fig. 5). In fact, Acaulospora and \n\nScutellospora were not only the two genera with higher frequency of occurrence (Fig. \n\n6 a; 6 b) but also the most abundant (Fig. 7 a; 7 b) in semi-natural sites, having been \n\nS. calospora and A. myriocarpa the dominant species of these genera (Fig. 5). On the \n\nother hand, in intensive land use Glomus was the more frequent genus having been \n\npresent in more than 90 % of the samples (Fig. 6 c; 6 d). Glomus was the most \n\nabundant genus (Fig. 7 c; 7 d), having contributed with about 40% of the total AMF \n\nspores density of intensive land use field sites. Between the various species of \n\nGlomus, G. etunicatum was the most representative species of this genus (Fig. 5). \n\nParaglomus also was more frequent in intensive field sites than in semi-natural ones \n\n(Fig. 6 c; 6 d), as well as more abundant (Fig. 7 c; 7 d). \n\nInteresting was the frequency of occurrence of Acaulospora, having been present in \n\nalmost all samples of intensive land use (Fig. 6 c; 6 d), especially the relative density \n\nof A. paulinae, that made it in the dominant species of this genus in RP2 (Fig. 6 d). \n\n Furthermore, other species were more or less restricted to specific field sites which \n\ncontributed to enhance, the role of management systems as key factor in species \n\ncomposition between semi-natural and intensive land uses. Thus, in relation to the \n\nfield sites of semi-natural land use we observed that Acaulospora delicata, \n\nAcaulospora thomii, Glomus intraradices, Intraspora schenckii and Gigaspora sp. only \n\noccurred in PX, whereas Acaulospora excavata, Acaulospora tuberculata, Glomus sp. \n\n3 and Glomus sp. 4 were detected only in TB (Fig. 5). On the other hand, we also \n\nnoted that some species exclusively occurred in RP1, like Acaulospora elegans, \n\nGlomus sp. 5, Glomus sp. 6, Glomus sp. 8 and Glomus sp. 9 (Fig. 5). Finally we \n\nobserved that 9 AMF were only detected in RP1, most of them belong to genus \n\nGlomus, such Glomus lamellosum, Glomus globiferum, Glomus sp. 9, Glomus sp. 10, \n\nGlomus sp. 11, Glomus sp. 12, Glomus sp. 13.

Lack of consistent differences across the two managements practices \n\ninvestigated are opposite to previous reports of lower diversity and abundance of AMF \n\nspores in disturbed than in more pristine soils (Boddington and Dodd 2000; Oehl, et \n\nal., 2003; Gai et al., 2006). Among others, Eason et al. (1999) detected root \n\ncolonisation and AMF spore density was significantly lower in conventional grassland \n\nthan in organic ones. Oehl et al. (2004) noted that AMF spore abundance and species \n\ndiversity was significantly higher in the organic than conventional systems. Also \n\nCastillo et al. (2006) observed that the number of AMF spore was affected by the \n\ntillage systems, have been higher under no-tillage than under no-tillage conditions. \n\nGai et al. (2009) found that the lowest species richness, spore density and Shannon \n\nindex of AMF in the montane scrub could be explained by the intensity of land use, \n\nonce these grasslands are severely disturbed as result of agriculture practices. \n\nHowever our result was consistent with found by some authors. Among others, Jansa \n\net al. (2002) found that spore abundance was not significantly affected by soil tillage. \n\nAlso Sjoberg et al. (2004) did not find significant differences in spore densities \n\nbetween semi-natural grassland and ploughed fields. Schalamuk et al. (2006) found \n\nspores of at least 24 species belonging to 6 genera of AMF in non-tilled and tilled \n\nwheat soils in Argentina. In this study, tilling or fertilisation did not seem to affect the \n\ndiversity of spores present, instead spore communities were affected by other factors \n\nparticular wheat phenology. \n\nMore recently, Jefwa et al. (2009) found along a land use gradient, that land use type \n\nhad not significant effect on AMF spore abundance.  \n\n \n\nAMF spore composition \n\nHowever, striking differences were found in species composition between land uses. \n\nSpecies in Glomus were dominant in intensive land uses, indicating adaptability in \n\nadjusting patterns of sporulation to environmental conditions as evidenced by its global \n\ndistribution (Gai et al., 2009). Prevalence of Glomus species in agricultural soil is \n\nwidely reported (Jansa et al., 2002; Oehl et al., 2003; Mathimaran et al., 2005; Wang \n\nand Vestberg, 2008). \n\nOehl et al. (2003) found that some species that had a \u201cgeneralist\u201d behavior, most of \n\nthem belong to Glomus genus, were prevalent in intensively managed systems. The \n\nsame author pointed out not only a decreased in AMF species richness with increase \n\nof land use intensity, but also a preferential selection of species that colonised roots \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0II\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                                                                                                                                       \n\n   88\u00a0\n \n\nslowly but formed spores rapidly. Also Jansa et al. (2003) found that in conventional \n\ntilled soils, almost exclusively AMF belonging to Glomus spp. were present, and that \n\nthis could be explain by a stimulatory effect of tillage on hyphae growth and/or by the \n\nlower completion for root colonization cause by the absence of other AMF species. \n\nLately, Castillo et al. (2006) in same field site conditions also noted that Glomus spp. \n\nconstituted about 65 % of total spores in both cultivation systems. Mathimaran et al. \n\n(2005) only detected Glomus genus in Swiss agricultural soil. \n\n \n\nColonisation strategies of AMF  \n\nThe dominance of Glomus genus in such disturbed systems could be related to \n\ndifferences in propagative units between the glomalean families (Jansa et al., 2003; \n\nCastillo et al., 2006). Members of Glomaceae have a highly infective extra-radical \n\nmycelium that could allow colonising immediately plant roots (Hart and Reader, 2002). \n\nAdding, Glomus forms anastomose between mycelia and possibility therefore has the \n\nability to re-establish an interconnected network after mechanical disturbance (Daniell \n\net al., 2001). Contrary members of Gigasporaceae, those are only capable of \n\npropagation via spore dispersal or infection from an intact mycelium would colonise \n\nplant roots more slowly than members of Glomaceae. Spore dormancy and specific \n\nenvironmental conditions for spore germination probably slow the rate at which \n\nregenerating AMF can colonise plant roots (Hart and Reader, 2002). Then, these \n\ndifferences can explain the dominance of the Glomaceae over members of the \n\nGigasporaceae in an environment with repetitive severe physical disturbance, for \n\nexample ploughing between crop cycles. \n\nThe most striking effect of different managements systems concerned the spore \n\nabundance of AMF species not belonging to the genus Glomus. Many of these \n\nspecies appeared to prefer or even to be restricted to the semi-natural field sites. This \n\nwas the case for most species of Acaulospora, Scutellospora as well as \n\nEntrophospora. Jansa et al. (2002) argued that tillage had a significant influence on \n\nsporulation of some species and non-Glomus AMF tend to be more abundant in the \n\nno-tilled soil. Then they have reported, although not significant, a slight increased in \n\nthe incidence of Gigaspora, Scutellospora and Entrophospora in the no-tilled soil. The \n\nabsence or lower abundance of non-Glomus AMF under tillage condition might be \n\nattributed to the yearly disruption of the extraradical hyphae of these fungi induced by \n\nthis management practice (Jansa et al., 2003).  \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0II\u00a0\u00a0\n\n  \n\n                                                                                                                                                   89\u00a0\n  \n\nThis trend towards an increase in AMF belong to genera Acaulospora, Scutellospora \n\nas well as Entrophospora under long-term reduced tillage managements was also \n\nobserved  by Oehl et al. (2004) in organic farming. These authors argue that some \n\nspecies, especially Acaulospora, Scutellospora, Cetrapora and Gigaspora have \n\nspecific and rather narrow, inhabitating preferably organic farming systems, which \n\ncould be probably related with lower nutrient level (especially available P) in these \n\nagroecosystems (Oehl et al., 2010).  \n\nAlso B\u00f6rstler et al. (2006) found in a study development in an extensively/ intensively \n\nfarmed meadows that Acaulospora was only detected at the extensively ones.  \n\nHowever, despite Acaulospora has been not only the most abundant but also the more \n\nfrequent genus in semi-natural land use, it is interesting to note that in intensive ones \n\nAcaulospora also was one of the most frequent genus and together with Glomus \n\ngenus formed the highest proportion of spores in intensive field sites. A similar result \n\nwas found by Castillo et al. (2006) who reported a tendency for a slightly higher \n\nrelative presence of spore of Acaulospora spp. under conventional-tillage than under \n\nno-tillage sytems. Also, Jefwa et al. (2009) point out that AMF species spore \n\nabundance was a response to stress with Glomaceae and Acaulosporaceae \n\nresponding to harsh conditions by producing spores, which making them to persist and \n\ndominate disturbed landscapes longer. \n\n \n\nSoil nutrient availability \n\nNutrient availability affects the composition of AMF communities in the soil (Ezawa et \n\nal., 2001; Titus and Leps, 2000). In fact, the density of 3 genera most representative \n\nAcaulospora, Glomus and Scutellospora was correlated with almost soil nutrients. \n\nBoddington and Dodd (2000) observed the development of indigenous AMF by adding \n\norganic matter. Khanam et al. (2006) also found in important available agricultural \n\ncrops in Bangladesh a positive correlation between soil nutrients levels (N, K, OM) and \n\nspore numbers. Nevertheless, the opposite was observed in relation to total AMF \n\nspore density, which corroborated the generalisation that inorganic fertilisers always \n\nhave a lowering effect on all glomale species (Jefwa et al., 2006). \n\nAmong soil nutrients phosphorus is widely known to inhibit the composition and \n\ndiversity of AMF communities as well as spore and mycelium densities in temperate \n\nand tropical systems (Agwa and Al-Sodany, 2003; Jansa et al., 2005; Khanam et al., \n\n2006).

A similar result was reported by Mathimaran et al. \n\n(2005) who not found an effect of P fertilisation on spore density in field site and in trap \n\nculture, either by Rodriguez-Echeverria et al. (2007) who also not detected a \n\ncorrelation between AMF abundance and soil fertility. It is interesting to note that the P \n\nlevel in the two land use under study was low and below to the level considered \n\nprejudicial to AMF, this may have been reflect in the way how other soil nutrients, \n\nparticularly nitrogen, may affect AMF community. Under P-limited conditions, the \n\ninvestment of a host plant in AMF genus or species should be strengthened to \n\nmaintain the uptake of-limiting nutrients (Johnson et al., 2003). So as predicted by the \n\nfunctional equilibrium model, in low-P soil, relative allocation to arbuscules, coils and \n\nextraradical hyphae is generally increased by N enrichment and vice-versa (Johnson \n\net al., 2003). Consequently, we can observe an increase in AMF productivity, species \n\nrichness and diversity with N fertilisation, being in these conditions the most \n\nresponsive AMF taxa Acaulospora, Scutellospora and Gigaspora. The opposite occur \n\nin P-rich with N fertilisation application, observing an intensification of AMF community \n\ndue to the loss of rare AMF species and the increase on abundance of Glomus \n\nspecies (Egerton-Warburton et al., 2007). Then, changes in AMF community may be \n\nexplained by changes in the soil N:P ratio. \n\nOur results were consistent with found by Johnson et al. (2003) and Egerton-\n\nWarburton et al. (2007). In fact, the spore densities of Acaulospora and Scutellospora \n\nwere positively correlated with N soil nutrient, but the opposite occurred with spore \n\ndensity of Glomus genus, which was reflected in a greater abundance of genera \n\nAcaulospora and Scutellospora in semi-natural land use, as well as, in higher \n\nabundance of Glomus genus in intensive ones. \n\n \n\nWe conclude that land use type had no significant effect on AMF spore diversity and \n\ntotal density. However clear differences were found in AMF spores composition \n\nbetween land uses. Species of Glomus were dominant in intensive pastures, while \n\nAcaulospora and Scutellospora predominated in semi-natural pastures. This could be \n\nexplained through different strategies of colonisation adopted by AMF and by soil \n\nnutrient levels.

Introduction \n\n \n\nArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are obligate mutualistic symbionts that colonise \n\nmore than 85% of terrestrial plants (Smith and Read, 1997; Smith et al., 1999; \n\nRonsheim and Anderson, 2001; Wilkinson, 2001). In addition AMF are essential \n\ncomponents of soil microbiota in most agroecosystems (Smith and Read, 1997; \n\nBoddington and Dodd, 2000).  By forming an extended hyphal network, AMF can \n\nimprove the growth of different plant species due to enhanced nutrient uptake, \n\nparticularly immobile nutrients like phosphorus, because the hyphae can reach farther \n\nthat the nutrient depleted zones that build up around plant roots (Smith and Read, 1997; \n\nClark and Zeto, 2000). As symbionts of plants, AMF fungi can indirectly affect \n\nherbivores by reducing acceptability of the plant tissue, altering the nutritional quality, or \n\nincreasing concentrations or types of defence compounds in the plant tissue, which can \n\nalter host resistance to these enemies (Gange and Weast, 1994; Master and Brown, \n\n1997; Borowicz, 1997; Gange et al., 1999; Goverde et al., 2000; Wearn and Gange, \n\n2007). AMF colonisation commonly improves tolerance of crops to other forms of biotic \n\nstress, such as nematodes (de la Pe\u00f1a et al., 2006; Rodriguez-Romero et al., 2005, \n\nRodriguez-Echeverria et al., 2009) and root pathogens (Smith et al., 1999; Klironomos \n\net al., 2000; Idoia et al., 2004) as well as to a abiotic stresses, such as drought and \n\nmetal toxicity (Gonzalez-Chavez et al., 2002). Furthermore, AMF contribute to soil \n\naggregation because the hyphal network builds up of a macroporous structure that \n\nfacilities penetration of water and air and prevents erosion ( Rilling et al., 2003; \n\nPiotrowski et al., 2004; Cavagnaro et al., 2006; Van Der Heijden et al., 2006).  Another \n\nimportant role of AMF is their contribution as drivers of plant community composition \n\n(Van der Heijden et al., 1998; Wolfe et al., 2006). \n\nAMF are therefore beneficial for plant performance, playing a crucial role for the \n\nsustainability of natural and agriculture ecosystems (Bareae et al., 2005). However, the \n\ndistribution and colonisation by AMF are affected by various physico-chemical factors of \n\nsoil such as pH, moisture and temperature (Abbott and Robson, 1981). Furthermore, \n\nagricultural practices like tillage, crop sequence and the composition and application of \n\nchemicals alter AMF populations, species composition and root colonisation (Eason et \n\nal., 1999; Boddington and Dodd, 2000; Jansan et al., 2002; Oehl et al., 2003; Purin et \n\nal., 2006). Tillage has been shown to have a significant influence on AMF colonisation \n\n(Douds and Miller, 1999; Jansa et al., 2003; Schalamuck et al., 2006; Garcia et al., \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0III\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                                       \n\n \n\n96\u00a0\n \n\n2007). The AMF hyphal network is the main source of AMF inoculum in soils, and tillage \n\ncauses severe disruption to the mycorrhizal network resulting in delayed or reduced root \n\ncolonisation and a reduction in the volume of soil that is exploited by AMF (Evans and \n\nMiller, 1990; Boddington and Dodd, 2000). In the same way, hyphae and colonised root \n\nfragments are transported to the upper soil layer, decreasing and diluting their activity \n\nas viable propagules for subsequent crops. On the other hand, phosphorus (P) uptake \n\nby plants is generally increased with tillage, due partly to an improved distribution of P \n\nand increased P availability (Borie et al., 2006; Garcia et al., 2007). Castillo et al. (2006) \n\nreported that, under conditions of no tillage AMF root colonisation rates as well as the \n\nspecies richness and number of spores were higher than in tillage conditions. However, \n\nJansa et al. (2002) found no significant effect of tillage on diversity indices of the AMF \n\ncommunity, and Schalamuk et al. (2006) observed a higher number of AMF species in \n\nconventional tilled soils than in non-tilled soils cropped with wheat, suggesting that is \n\nnot always detrimental to AM biodiversity. \n\nMycorrhizal benefits are usually reduced when soil nutrients are abundant. For \n\ninstance, an increase in soil P availability negatively affects mycorrhizal colonisation of \n\nplant roots (Al-Karaki and Clark, 1999; Eason et al., 1999; Bhadalung et al., 2005; Li et \n\nal., 2006). Other edaphic factors such as an excess of nitrogen (N) (Blanke et al., 2005; \n\nBradley et al., 2006; Porras-Alfaro et al., 2007) and extreme pH (Clark et al., 1999; \n\nEzawa et al., 2001; Khanam et al., 2006) may also create conditions in which there is \n\nlittle or no benefit to the host plant from AMF. In addition to affecting plant performance, \n\nthese factors also influence host plant dependency on AMF symbiosis and the level of \n\nroot colonisation. \n\nGrazing has also been found to dramatically reduce AMF colonisation and spores \n\ndensities (Gange et al., 1993; Gehring et al., 1994; Lugo and Cabello, 2002; Dhillion \n\nand Gardsjord, 2004). This may be due to a decrease in leaf area and an increase in \n\nthe root/shoot ratio that results in a decreased source capacity that is insufficient to \n\nsatisfy root and AMF sink demands. Indeed, Dhillion and Gardsjord (2004) found a \n\nsignificantly higher level of AMF colonisation in ungrazed grasslands than in grazed \n\nones. \n\nNevertheless, Eom et al.

Similarly, Wearn and Gange (2007) also found that moderate \n\ngrazing by rabbits had a rapid and persistent positive effect on the mycorrhizal \n\ncolonisation of roots of three grasses studied in two grasslands.  \n\nIn many terrestrial ecosystems, temporal changes in AMF colonisation show a seasonal \n\npattern correlated with several factors such as plant phenology, with the highest rates of \n\ncolonisation occurring during flowering and fruiting (Titus and Leps, 2000; Lugo and \n\nCabello, 2002; B\u00f6hrer et al., 2004) when demand for phosphorus is high (Sanders and \n\nFitter, 1992). Likewise, AMF colonisation is also influenced by the host metabolic \n\npathway (Wilson and Hartnett, 1997; Lugo et al., 2003; Busso et al., 2008; Collins and \n\nFoster, 2009), because the growth responses of AMF fungal species depend on the \n\nparticular host/fungus combination, i.e. whether the host species is a facultative (C3) or \n\nan obligate (C4) mycotroph. So, some symbiotic relationships are more favoured than \n\nothers. Nutrient exchanges (Eom et al., 2000; Titus and Leps, 2000) and climatic \n\nvariations (Kachi and Rorison, 1990; Heinemeyer and Fitter, 2004; Gavito et al., 2005) \n\nalso have been reported to affect temporal changes in AMF colonisation.  \n\nThe Azores archipelago has an extended area of grasslands (Martins, 1993), including \n\nnatural grasslands, semi-natural pastures and intensive pastures (see Borges et al., \n\n2008). Through time, native forests have been destroyed by human activities and \n\nreplaced by agricultural land. After several economic cycles and some catastrophic \n\nexperiences with different types of monocultures (e.g. wheat Triticum spp.; \"Pastel\" \n\nIsatis tinctoria L. and; orange-tree Citrus spp.) (Martins, 1993) during the second half of \n\nthe 20th century cattle milk production has grown in importance (Martins, 1993; Borges, \n\n1997). In order to respond to the high density of cattle milk farms, pastures became the \n\ndominant landscape in the Azores archipelago, covering 67.7 % of the arable land, and \n\nthere are also semi-natural pastures that comprise 11.2 % of the total area (Garcia and \n\nFurtado, 1991). Most semi-natural pasture are located at high altitude in recent infertile \n\nacidic volcanic soils (e.g. Terceira and Pico), or in more mature but still poor soils (e.g. \n\nS. Maria) (Borges, 1997). The floristic composition of pastures is dominated by \n\nintroduced grasses and leguminous forbs, while native forbs (e.g. Lotus uliginosus), \n\ngrasses, rushes, sedges and ferns are more frequent in the poorly managed, old, semi-\n\nnatural pastures (Borges, 1997). Relatively little is known about the AMF community \n\nstructure in these agroecosystems and their role in maintaining pasture productivity. \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0III\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                                       \n\n \n\n98\u00a0\n \n\nWhether there are differences in the AMF community between the semi-natural and \n\nintensively managed pastures is also unknown. Therefore, in order to better understand \n\nthe basic biology of AMF and their role in these agroecosystems, it is necessary to \n\nanalyse the AMF diversity and seasonal patterns of the AMF communities in these \n\nagroecosystems.  \n\nSeveral approaches have been developed to study AMF community structure. \n\nTraditional studies on AMF diversity are based mainly on spore morphology (Walker, \n\n1992), but taxonomic identification of AMF spores collected directly from the field is \n\nquite difficult because they are often unidentifiable due to degradation or parasitisation \n\nby other organisms. Furthermore, as they are obligate symbionts, they cannot be \n\ncultivated in the absence of their host. Catch plants are often used to produce \n\nidentifiable spores (Bever et al., 2001). Although useful for the isolation and \n\npropagation of some AMF species, this indirect culture strategy is time-consuming, and \n\nbiases are often introduced by plant preferences for AMF species, different growth \n\nconditions, and other environmental factors, which hinder its suitability for the \n\ncharacterisation of AMF communities (Jansa et al., 2002; Oehl et al., 2003). \n\nFurthermore, mycorrhizal root colonisation results, as well as spore numbers (Clapp et \n\nal. 1995), do not necessarily reflect the AMF populations present in soils but only the \n\nsporulation stage of the AMF life cycle (a dormant phase) rather than the activity within \n\na symbiosis. This results of fact, that not all AMF present as spores form active \n\nmycorrhizae and that many taxa present in roots may not be sporulating.  \n\nRecently molecular methods based on the amplification of DNA from soil or roots by \n\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) in combination with denaturing gradient gel \n\nelectrophoresis (DGGE) have proved to be useful tools for characterising of AMF \n\ncommunity (Kowalchuk et al. 2002; Ma et al. 2005; Santos et al. 2006). Kowalchuk et \n\nal. 2002 reported discrepancies between the AMF-like groups detected in spore \n\npopulation versus direct 18S rDNA (small subunit of ribosomal DNA) analyses of root \n\nmaterial by DGGE, corroborating previous suggestions that spore inspection alone may \n\npoorly represent actual AMF population structure. Similarly, Zhu et al. (2007) found that \n\nPCR-DGGE profiles clearly revealed the difference between the native AMF \n\ncommunity structures in roots at two different pH levels (5.0 and 6.0). They detected \n\nmore bands in the samples from pH 5.0 pots than from pH 6.0 pots (Fig. 1), indicating \n\nhigher diversity of the native AMF at pH 5.0, i.e. the pH value similar to their original \n\nenvironmental pH. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0III                  \n\n \n\n99\u00a0\n \n\nIn this molecular approach, PCR amplicons sharing the same length are separated \n\nelectrophoretically in a sequence-dependent manner based on their GC-content \n\n(Rodriguez-Echeverria et al. 2009). The increasing gradient of denaturing components \n\nalong the gel causes the double-stranded amplicons to denature into single stranded \n\nDNA through melting domains that decrease their mobility (and thus their position in the \n\ngel). A GC-clamp attached to the 5\u2019 end of one of the PCR primers prevents the \n\namplicons from completely denaturing. Different sequences have different origins of \n\nmelting domains and, consequently different positions in the gel where DNA fragments \n\nhalt (Rodriguez-Echeverria et al. 2009). This strategy provides a robust means of \n\ndetecting and identifying AMF-like species without the use of trap plant cultivation \n\nmethods (Kowalchuk et al. 2002). \n\nThe main objective of this study was to determine the effects of land use and the \n\nsampling time on the community structure of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi associated \n\nwith Holcus lanatus L.

Recent historical volcanic activity is evident in the western part \n\nof the island, where several well preserved lava tubes and volcanic chimneys are \n\npresent (Borges et al., 1993). The Azores archipelago have a temperate oceanic \n\nclimate characterised by high levels of relative atmospheric humidity that could reach \n\n95% at high altitude native forests and ensures slight thermal variations throughout the \n\nyear (Azevedo et al., 1999). The average temperature is 17.5\u00b0 C in low altitudes, while \n\nthe maximum temperature is in August and minimum in February (Azevedo, 1996). The \n\npluviometric regime reaches its peak in January-February and minimum and July \n\n(Azevedo, 1996): Angra do Hero\u00edsmo (47 m): 969 mm year (140 mm in January and 40 \n\nmm in July) and Serra de S. B\u00e1rbara (1,023 m): 3,000 mm year (Borges, 1997).  \n\nThe sampling areas were cattle-grazed upland pastures of two different types: semi-\n\nnatural pastures (managed for more than 50 years, with a higher diversity of grasses \n\nand forbs; see Borges and Brown 2001) and intensive pastures (managed for more \n\nthan 20 years, characterised also by a poor vascular flora of five or less dominant \n\nspecies).The semi-natural pastures are included in a site of communitarian interest \n\n(SIC- Serra de Santa Barbara e Pico Alto) inside of Rede Natura 2000: Pico Galhardo \n\n(PX) (Latitude 38\u00ba 41\u2019 51.71\u2019\u2019 N; Longitude 27\u00ba 13\u2019 25.34\u2019\u2019 W) and Terra Brava (TB) \n\n(Latitude 38\u00ba 41\u2019 59.74\u2019\u2019 N; Longitude 27\u00ba 12\u2019 41.37\u2019\u2019 W) (Fig. 1). \n\nThese pastures show a high floristic diversity, and they are dominated by the grasses \n\nHolcus lanatus and Agrostis castellana, perennial grasses that covers around 100% of \n\nsites (Dias, 1996; Borges, 1997).

Root-intersects that contained vesicles, \n\narbuscules or hyphae were scored as mycorrhizal. The decision to score hyphae as \n\nmycorrhizal was based on the absence of septate hyphae, and to presence of vesicles, \n\narbuscules and spores associated. In total, 80 samples were examined to score 100 \n\nintersections in each (McGonigle et al., 1990). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.7. Diversity of AMF communities \n\n2.7.1.

A total of \n\n80 sampled roots were used for the molecular analysis. About 1g of fine roots per \n\nsample were stained with ink (see above) to access AMF colonisation and the \n\nremaining preserved in alcohol 48%, until to be use to DNA extraction.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.7.2. DNA extraction from roots \n\nDNA was extracted from 80 samples of H. lanatus roots using the REDExtract-N-Amp \n\nPlant PCR KIT (Sigma). Aliquots (1 g) of fresh roots sampled in each sample were firstly \n\ncarefully cleaned with tap water and washed several times with sterile water to remove \n\nthe alcohol, and then finely crushed, macerated and transferred into a 1,5-ml Eppendorf \n\ntube. After adding an equal volume of glass beads, the roots were macerated again, \n\nand stirred in a vortex for 4 min. Afterwards, 200 \u00b5l of extraction solution was added to \n\nthe extraction mix and the roots were incubated at 60 ?C for 30 min. Then a dilution \n\nsolution was added (200 \u00b5l) to the roots, and the mix was stirred in a vortex for 30 sec. \n\nThe supernatant was separated by root fragments by centrifugation (8000 r.p.m) and a \n\n4 \u00b5l aliquot was used for PCR amplification of 28 S ribosomal subunit gene. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0III\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                                       \n\n \n\n104\u00a0\n \n\n2.7.3.

We used the primers LR1 (Trouvelot et al. 1999) specific of \n\neukaryotic and FLR2 (van Tuinen et al. 1998) specific of fungi. A 25 \u00b5l reaction mix \n\ncontained 12.5 \u00b5l of Red Extract solution, 1.25 \u00b5l each primer and 5 \u00b5l of PCR-grade \n\nwater. PCR was performed on a Gene Amp. PCR system 2700 Thermo Cycler (Applied \n\nBiosystems, Faster City, California) and the program was a followed: 93 ?C for 1 min, 58 \n\n?C for 1 min and 72 ?C for 10 min (35 cycles), followed by 10 min at 72 ?C. The PCR \n\nproducts were used as templates for the second PCR with the primer FLR3-GC (FLR3 \n\nplus a GC at the 5\u2019 end) and FLR4 under the same PCR condition. FLR3 and FLR4 \n\nwere described by Gollote et al.(2004) as specific for Glomeromycota fungi. The PCR \n\nproducts were run on 2 % (W/V) agarose gel in 1 X TAE buffer and visualised under UV \n\nlight after staining with ethidium bromide. About 0.4 \u00b5g of DNA from each sample was \n\nused for DGGE analysis (Rodriguez-Echeverria et al. 2009). Gels contained 8% (w/v) \n\npolyacrylamide (37:1 acrylamide/bis-acrylamide) and 1 X TAE.

Molecular identification of AMF in the roots \n\nDNA extracted from the 80 H. lanatus samples roots collected from field sites, was first \n\nused in the same nested PCR protocol as previously described to confirm the AMF \n\npresence on roots.

Data analysis \n\nThe sampling design was nested hierarchical design, with sampling date nested within \n\nfield sites and field sites nested within land use. Then, to investigate the variation on \n\npercentage of colonisation of different AMF structures between land uses, between field \n\nsites within each land use and between sampling dates within each sites we used \n\nNested ANOVA (Minitab, version 13.31, 2000). AMF diversity was estimated via the \n\nnumber of bands with different positions in the acrylamide gel per sample and \n\nsubsequently per field site and land use. Then, a Nested ANOVA was performed to \n\nestimate de variation on species richness between land uses, between field sites within \n\neach land use and between sampling dates within each field site. The same proceed \n\nwas made to investigate the variation on occurrence of five AMF species (Glomus \n\netunicatum, Glomus intraradices, Glomus mosseae, Glomus claroideum and Glomus \n\nmicroaggregatum) between land uses, between field sites within each land use and \n\nbetween sampling dates within each field site. All data were tested for normality, and \n\ndata of percentage of colonisation of different AMF structures were arcsine-transformed \n\nwhen required to fulfil assumptions of the Nested ANOVA. Since only complete abiotic \n\ndata were available for the year 2007, the correlation analyses between the abiotic \n\nfactors and the proportion of colonisation of different AM structures and between \n\noccurrence of five AMF species (G. etunicatum, G. intraradices, G. mosseae, G. \n\nclaroideum and G. microaggregatum) were only performed for the 2007 data using the \n\nPearson correlation coefficient. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0III\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                                       \n\n \n\n108\u00a0\n \n\n3.

Root colonisation \n\nOver this study the percentage of AMF colonisation was strongly influenced by the land \n\nuse and the month/season in which the harvest took place within each local (Table 3). \n\nThus, for the first year of study (2006), we found that the percentage of AMF \n\ncolonisation varied significantly between land use (Nested Anova: F= 31.43; d.f= 1. 2; \n\np&lt;0.001), with the sampling time (Nested Anova: F= 5.72; d.f= 4. 72; p&lt;0.001) as well \n\nas between field sites with each land use (Nested Anova: F= 4.43; d.f=2. 4; p= 0.01) \n\n(Table 3). The average percentage of AMF colonisation was higher in the first sampling \n\ndate (July, 2006) than the second (September, 2006) in the semi-natural land use \n\nespecially in TB field site (Fig. 2 a; 2 b). The same result was obtained to percentage of \n\nAM hyphal colonisation, which also varied significantly between land use (Nested \n\nAnova: F= 33.61; d.f= 1. 2; p&lt;0.001), with the sampling time (Nested Anova: F= 5.86; \n\nd.f= 4. 72; p&lt;0.001) as well as between field sites with each land use (Nested Anova: \n\nF= 4.53; d.f=2. 4; p= 0.01) (Table 3). The average percentage of AMF colonisation was \n\nhigher in the first sampling date (July, 2006) than the second (September, 2006) in the \n\nsemi-natural land use especially in TB field site (Fig. 2 a; 2 b).  \n\nThe percentage of AMF vesicle colonisation varied significantly between land use \n\n(Nested Anova: F= 39.10; d.f= 1. 2; p&lt;0.001) and between field sites within each land \n\nuses (Nested Anova: F=5.07; d.f= 2. 4; p= 0.009) (Table 3).

The \n\naverage of species richness was higher in PX and RP1, especially in the second \n\nsampling time (September). Indeed, bands of AMF were detected in 100 % of \n\nSeptember samples, but only in 35 % of the samples taken in July. \n\nAlthough the number of detected AMF bands having been higher in semi-natural (51 \n\nbands) than in intensive (42 bands), we did not found significant differences between \n\nland uses (Nested Anova: F= 1.51; d.f= 1. 2; p= 0.23) (Table 4). However, the number \n\nof bands/sample was higher in the semi-natural land use than in the intensive (Fig. 3 a). \n\nIn the second year (2007) the species number also varied significantly between field \n\nsites within each land use (Nested Anova: F= 10.10; d.f= 2. 4; p&lt;0.001) and with the \n\nsampling time in each field site (Nested Anova: F= 4.31; d.f= 4. 32; p= 0.007) (Table 4). \n\nThe average of species richness was higher in TB and in RP1, especially in the first \n\nsampling time (August). Indeed, in August we detected 83 bands of AMF against 47 \n\ndetected in November, i.e. about the double of the bands were detected in summer. \n\nAgain, there were no significant differences between land uses (Nested Anova: F= 0.36; \n\nd.f= 1. 2; p= 0.55) (Table 4). In fact the number of bands per land use was very similar, \n\na total of 69 and 61 bands of AMF were detected in semi-natural and intensive land \n\nuses respectively. Nevertheless, the number of bands/sample was in the semi-natural \n\nland use than in intensive Fig. 3 b). Thus, seems that in the intensive land use the \n\nplants are colonised by dominant AMF species. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0III\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                                       \n\n \n\n114\u00a0\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3.

The occurrence of this species in the first date of \n\nharvest was higher than in the second in TB and RP2, but the opposite was found in \n\nsites PX and RP1 (Fig. 6 a). G. etunicatum remained the dominant species, with a \n\nfrequency of occurrence of 80% in August and 70% in November. \n\nHowever, no significant differences were found in the presence of G. etunicatum \n\nbetween field sites within each land use (Nested Anova: F= 2.67; d.f= 2. 4; p= 0.09) \n\n(Table 6), or between land uses (Nested Anova: F= 0.67; d.f= 1. 2; p= 0.42) (Table 6). \n\nA similar result was found to G. intraradices; the presence of this species varied \n\nsignificantly with the sampling date in field each site (Nested Anova: F= 2.57; d.f= 4. 32; \n\np&lt;0.05) (Table 6). The occurrence of this species in the first date of harvest was higher \n\nthan the second in PX and RP1, but it was found the opposite in sites TB and RP2 (Fig. \n\n6 b). However, no significant differences were detected in the presence of G. \n\nintraradices between field sites within each land use (Nested Anova: F= 2.86; d.f= 2. 4; \n\np= 0.07) or between land uses (Nested Anova: F= 0; d.f= 1, 2; p= 1.00) (Table 6). The \n\npresence of G. mosseae (Fig. 6 c) did not vary significantly with the sampling date \n\nwithin each field site (Nested Anova: F= 0.93; d.f= 4. 32; p= 0.46) or between field sites \n\nwithin each land use (Nested Anova: F= 0.67; d.f= 2. 4; p= 0.52) as well as between \n\nland uses (Nested Anova: F= 0.13; d.f= 1. 2; p= 0.72) (Table 6). As in the first year of \n\nstudy, G. mosseae continued to be one of the dominant species, and showed little \n\nchanges in its occurrence between the two harvesting dates (80% in August and 70% in \n\nNovember). \n\nA similar result was found for G. claroideum (Fig. 6 d), which did not vary significantly \n\nwith the harvest date in each field site (Nested Anova: F= 1.00; d.f= 4. 32; p= 0.42) or \n\nbetween field sites within each land use (Nested Anova: F= 0.33; d.f= 2. 4; p= 0.72) as \n\nwell as between land uses (Nested Anova: F= 0.33; d.f= 1. 2; p= 0.57) (Table 6). \n\nFinally, the presence of G. microaggregatum varied significantly between land uses \n\n(Nested Anova: F=32.67; d.f= 1. 2; p<0.001) with the sampling date within each field \n\nsite (Nested Anova: F= 19.33; d.f= 4. 32; p&lt;0.001) and between field sites within each \n\nland use (Nested Anova: F=6.00; d.f= 2. 4; p= 0.006) (Table 6).

However when we \n\nanalysed each species separately, only the presence of two species seemed to be \n\naffected by soil nutrients, especially phosphorus (Table 8). This way, the occurrence of \n\nG. etunicatum was significantly and negative related with P (r= -0.558, p&lt;0.05), and \n\nalso the occurrence of G. intraradices had a negative and significant correlation with P \n\n(r= -0.574, p&lt;0.01). \n\nThe phosphorus content of soil expressed significant positive correlation with OC (r= \n\n0.439, p&lt;0.05).

Discussion \n\n \n\nFungal intraradical structures  \n\nFor the first time in the Azores we provided key insights into patterns of root colonisation \n\nby AMF, which was strongly constrained by land use type. Over the two years of study, \n\nroot colonisation was always higher in semi-natural land use than in intensively \n\nmanagement pastures. This result is in agreement with those found by several authors. \n\nAmong others, Eason et al. (1999) reported that AMF root colonisation was lower in \n\ngrassland soils with a history of high-input and, conventional management than in soil \n\nwith a low-input or organic management. Kahiluoto et al. (2001) demonstrated reduced \n\nAMF colonisation of roots and reduced AMF spore density in soil with increasing P \n\nfertilization for several crops on two soils with low and intermediate concentrations of \n\navailable P. Similarly, Oehl et al. (2003) found higher colonisation levels in plants grown \n\non organic soils compared to ones grown conventionally. Also Gryndler et al. (2006) \n\nfound that long-term mineral fertilisation and manure addition had a negative effect on \n\nAMF root colonisation, measured by AMF hyphal length in soil. \n\nThe abundance of fungal structure also showed a marked seasonality, particularly in the \n\nsecond year of study. This could have been related to nutrient exchanges, host plant \n\nphenology, host metabolic pathways and climatic variations (Titus and Leps, 2000; Lugo \n\nMicrobial Soil nutrients\nTotal number of species Presence of species\n\nAMF Getunic Gintrar Gmoss Gclaroid P K N OM Ca Mg\n\nP 0.243 -0.558* -0.574** -0.274 -0.304\n\nK 0.375 0.188 -0.043 0.066 -0.05 0.389*\n\nN 0.444* 0.094 -0.238 -0.115 0,000 0.408** 0.610***\n\nOM 0.505* 0.179 -0.165 -0.063 0.021 0.346* 0.712*** 0.986***\n\nCa 0.523* 0.288 -0.024 -0.053 0.02 0.278 0.942*** 0.805*** 0.889***\n\nMg 0.554* 0.281 -0.06 0.016 0.039 0.265 0.852*** 0.906*** 0.963*** 0.976***\n\nOC 0.524* 0.206 -0.548 -0.052 0.035 0.306* 0.704*** 0.982*** 0.999*** 0.888*** 0.965***\n\nTable 8.

In the studied semi-natural and intensive pastures \n\nH. lanatus was the dominant species. This species is a weakly mycotrophic species as \n\nit is a C3 plant (Cornelissen et al., 2001). Allen and Allen (1988) postulated that the \n\npresence of facultative mycorrhizal plant species can result in increased mycorrhizal \n\ninoculum levels in disturbed soils, which may help obligatory mycorrhizal plant species \n\nto become established later in the succession. Egerton-Warburton et al. (2007) found a \n\nhigher hyphal length in C3 plants than in C4 plants, and they suggested that this could \n\nbe related with the greater energetic investment for carbon (C) and P acquisition from \n\nsoil by C3 plants. Another possibility is the that phenological differences between C3 and \n\nC4 plants enhance the preemption of space; in other words, AMF in C3 plants take over \n\nany soil space vacated by AMF associated with C4 plants. \n\nAll fungal structures (hyphae, vesicles and arbuscules) were more abundant in summer \n\nharvests. This result is consistent with Titus and Leps (2000) and Lugo et al. (2003). \n\nThese authors found that in B. subaristata (C3) root colonisation measured as the \n\nnumber of arbuscules and vesicles changed with season and reached at maximum in \n\nsummer. \n\nThe abundance of intraradical structures is usually closely related to host growth, \n\nflowering and fruit production (Smith and Read, 1997). Thus the high percentage of \n\nAMF root colonisation in our summer sampling periods matches the start of the \n\nreproductive phase of Holcus lanatus at the sites. During flowering and/or fruiting the \n\nphosphorus demand is high and thus AMF colonisation levels were also high. This can \n\nalso be demonstrated by the higher percentage of AMF arbuscule colonisation during \n\nthis season. Likar et al. (2009) also found another peak in arbuscule formation during \n\nflowering, in Cruciata laevipes and Mentha piperata and argue that the rate of arbuscule \n\nformation can be enhanced during periods of extensive productivity in plants, such \n\nflowering. Arbuscules are the places where nutrients are exchanged between a plant \n\nand fungus, and a high percentage of AMF arbuscule colonisation indicates intense \n\nsymbiotic activity (Titus and Leps, 2000; Greipsson and DiTommaso, 2006).  \n\n \n\nMolecular diversity \n\nWe found that AMF diversity in semi-natural pastures had a marked seasonal pattern. \n\nOver the two years of the study larger number of DGGE bands was found during the \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0III\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                                       \n\n \n\n126\u00a0\n \n\nsummer, coinciding with the flowering and /fruiting phase of H. lanatus, i.e., the \n\nphenological stage during each nutrient demands are highest. \n\nHowever, among the two managements systems established there was a higher AMF \n\ndiversity in semi-natural pastures than in intensively managed pastures, though the \n\ndifference was not significant. Several authors reported larger AMF diversity for \n\norganically managed fields compared to conventionally managed fields. Among these, \n\nOehl et al. (2003; 2004) found that the intensification of land use and conventional \n\nfarming practices, as opposed to organic farming practices cause a reduction in AMF \n\nspore abundance and AMF species richness in agroecosystems of Central Europe. \n\nRodriguez-Echeverria and Freitas (2006) also reported that the diversity associated with \n\nAmmophila arenaria ssp. arundinacea was higher in the least disturbed sites. However, \n\nour result is consistent with the work by B\u00f6rstler et al. (2006) that found a similar \n\ndiversity in intensively farmed fields (with 11 species) compared with the non-intensively \n\nfarmed ones (with 10 species). Similarly, Galv\u00e1n et al. (2009) also found that AMF \n\ndiversity of organically grown onions did not differ from that those conventionally grown. \n\nThe similarity in species richness between land uses could be related to: a) the fact that \n\nthe AMF communities are highly generalist; b) the levels of intensification of the well-\n\nmanaged intensive pastures are low enough to allow similar patterns to semi-natural \n\npastures. In Terceira, the influence of human activities on the simplification of \n\necosystems is quite dramatic with very few endemic arthropods occurring in intensive \n\npastures (Cardoso et al., 2009). In fact, it is known that the input of fertilisers and \n\npesticides and several other management practices (e.g., grazing intensity) are \n\nimportant in defining the quality of the pasturelands for AMF (e.g. Gange et al., 1993; \n\nDhillion and Gardsjord, 2004). However, the input of fertilisers to Azorean pastureland is \n\nlower than average inputs to pastures on the European mainland (Garcia &amp; Furtado, \n\n1991). This fact gives support to our second hypothesis, which means that at Terceira, \n\nboth semi-natural and intensive pastures are reasonably benign habitats for AMF. \n\nOn the other hand, certain lanes in some gels produced double bands. This is a well-\n\nknown and common problem when using DGGE, in which two bands with the same \n\nsequence can appear very close to each other (Ma et al., 2005; Santos et al., 2006). \n\nThis observation may complicate the interpretation of field DGGE profiles, because any \n\nAMF isolate may represented by two or more bands. Therefore, the actual number of \n\nAMF in a field DGGE profile may be less than half of what is visually detected by \n\nDGGE.  \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0III                  \n\n \n\n127\u00a0\n \n\nMoreover, the molecular identification system used in this study is known to miss certain \n\ngroups of AMF (Kr?ger et al., 2009). In general, the LSU rDNA region allows for \n\nspecies-level resolution, and thus, the LSU primer pair FLR3\u2013FLR4 (Gollotte et al., \n\n2004) was used for species level community analyses. However, FLR4 in particular is \n\nnot phylogenetically inclusive (Gamper et al., 2009) and it does not amplify many \n\nlineages, including Diversisporales, Archaeosporales and Paraglomerales, which results \n\nin a strong bias in community analyses towards the Glomeraceae. The primer FLR3 \n\nbinds to the DNA of many non-target fungi. It has no mismatch to more than 1300 \n\nbasidiomycete sequences and some ascomycete sequences in the public databases \n\n(Kr?ger et al., 2009). Therefore, it is very likely that this study has missed a \n\nconsiderable portion of the AMF diversity. \n\nAlthough AMF diversity did not differ between management systems, it varied between \n\nfield sites within each land use. Our data unequivocally show that some arable soils \n\nshow an unexpectedly high diversity of AMF (especially RP1), which is in strong \n\ncontrast to the studies by Helgason et al. (1998) and Daniell et al. (2001). Hijri et al. \n\n(2006) also reported variation in AMF diversity within management systems. Despite \n\nhaving checked for differences between organic and conventional field sites, they also \n\nreported differences between two organic field sites. At lower AMF diversity was \n\nobserved in conventional field sites and in one organic field site. These authors argue \n\nthat, in some agroecosystems, the farming systems do not influence AMF diversity, but \n\nrather the specific management practices (e.g., crop rotation, tillage) or environmental \n\nconditions (pH, P) may contribute to the maintenance of a more diverse AMF \n\ncommunity. In fact, RP1 had the lower level of phosphate in the soil and the two semi-\n\nnatural field sites had the higher levels. Thus, as high phosphate concentration is known \n\nto reduce AMF root colonisation, it is very likely that AMF diversity is concurrently \n\nreduced in these field sites. Moreover, in RP1, Trifolium repens is one of the most \n\nabundant species of plants, and it is know that the continuous cultivation of this plant \n\nmight favour the presence of more AMF species in the long term (Gosling et al. 2006; \n\nHijri et al. 2006). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0III\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                                       \n\n \n\n128\u00a0\n \n\nOccurrence of G. etunicatum, G. intraradices, G. mosseae, G. claroideum and G. \n\nmicroaggregatum. \n\n \n\nIn the present study, we only found isolates from the Glomaceae in H. lanatus roots. \n\nPrevious studies have also showed that the genus Glomus is usually a dominant group \n\nin AMF communities in agricultural soil ecosystems (Helgason et al., 1998; Daniell et \n\nal., 2001; Jansan et al., 2002; Oehl et al., 2003, 2004; Mathimaran et al., 2005).

Hart and Reader (2002) \n\nshowed that isolates of Glomaceae were faster colonisers than Acaulosporaceae and \n\nGigasporaceae because they regenerate primarily from hyphal fragments and produce \n\nan extensive mycelium in roots rather than in soil. Furthermore, Giovannetti et al. (1999) \n\nhave shown that Glomus (but not Gigaspora or Scutellospora) readily form \n\nanastomoses between mycelia and might therefore have the ability to re-establish an \n\ninterconnected network after mechanical disruption. Such differences can explain the \n\ndominance of the Glomaceae over members of the Gigasporaceae in disturbed \n\nenvironments. On the other hand, the Glomales have traditionally been thought to be \n\nnon-specific, but there is evidence suggesting that, while there may not be host \n\nspecificity per se, partners may show preferences (van der Heijden et al., 1998). \n\n Finally, the absence of other AMF species in this study could be related also to other \n\nfactors, like the number of cycles of trap culture, sampling times, local environmental \n\nfactors or host plant regulation of carbon expenditure, that enable the species to \n\nproduce spores and persist as infective hyphae in roots or soil (Douds and Millner, \n\n1999). \n\nThe total species occurrence (of the detected G. etunicatum, G. intraradices, G. \n\nmosseae, G. claroideum and G. microaggregatum) H. lanatus roots only varied with \n\nsampling date in the second year of study. Probably, the proximity of sampling periods \n\nin the first year (July and September) contributed to the lack of an evident seasonal \n\npattern. Species occurrence was highest in August, coinciding with the reproductive \n\nphase of H. lanatus (Smith and Read, 1997; Titus and Leps, 2000; Lugo et al., 2003) \n\nand with the highest colonisation levels. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0III                  \n\n \n\n129\u00a0\n \n\nThe occurrences of five AMF species varied with sampling time over the two years of \n\nstudy. Glomus mosseae was the most abundant and constant species, and it was the \n\nonly species for which the frequency did not change with sampling time. Helgason et al. \n\n(1998) also found that in arable field sites the dominant arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal \n\ntype was a putative G. mosseae. The same authors argue that the absence of this \n\nspecies in the woodland studied was related to differences in propagative units between \n\nglomalean families. In fact, this species sporulates abundantly and colonises readily \n\nfrom spores, which may be more important in a field that is ploughed annually than in a \n\nwoodland. \n\nG. claroideum and G. microaggregatum were less abundant, both spatially and \n\ntemporally, and can be considered as rare species in some of the sites sampled. The \n\nsymbiotic performance of AMF isolates depends on two main parameters; colonisation \n\nability and efficiency. The rate of colonisation is influenced by the ability of AMF to \n\nspread rapidly and extensively across plants and is affected by factors linked to spore \n\ngermination, presymbiotic mycelial growth and appressorium formation (Avio et al., \n\n2006). In fact, G. mosseae and G. etunicatum were the two dominant species at all \n\nsampling dates; this may be related to competitive advantages for carbon uptake during \n\nearly root colonisation by these species (Jansa et al., 2008).  \n\nJansa et al. (2008) observed that G. mosseae was the most effective competitor out of \n\nthree AMF species (G. mosseae, G. intraradices, and G. claroideum) due to its fast rate \n\nof colonisation and early peak in colonisation. According to this same study, G. \n\nclaroideum was the weakest competitor, and G. intraradices was intermediate between \n\nthe two of them. \n\nFarmer et al., (2007) noted that in a study done under field conditions, G. etunicatum \n\nintroduced either as a pure inoculum or mixed with G. mosseae and G. intraradices had \n\ngreat success and was, detected in the roots of nearly all samples. However, our results \n\nsuggest that the high efficiency of G. etunicatum in establishing a mycorrhizal symbiosis \n\ncould explain the cross contamination of G. mosseae during inoculation production. \n\n \n\nSoil parameters and root colonisation \n\nAMF root colonisation levels have been associated with soil nutrient acquisition in \n\nperennial grasses (Jackson and Caldwell, 1996). In fact, the percentage of all fungal \n\nstructure and the total species occurrence (considering G. etunicatum, G. intraradices, \n\nG. mosseae, G. claroideum and G. microaggregatum) were positively correlated with \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0III\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                                       \n\n \n\n130\u00a0\n \n\nsoil nutrient levels. Thus, the improvement of soil fertility, especially the availability of K, \n\nN, Ca and Mg, provided a favourable environment for mycorrhizal formation and \n\nfunction in these systems. A similar result was found by Oliveira and Oliveira (2005). \n\nThese authors observed a strong influence of edaphic factors, such as soil moisture, \n\npH, Mg, K and Mn on symbiotic associations in the acidic soils and nutrient-limited soils \n\nof Central Amazonia. Khanam et al. (2006) also noted a positive correlation between \n\nroot colonisation and soil moisture, OM, total N and K. However, as shown in other \n\nstudies (Mathimaran et al., 2005; Ezawa et al., 2005; Rodriguez-Echeverria et al., \n\n2009), a correlation between the percentage of AMF colonisation and soil P content was \n\nnot found. The two investigated land uses (semi-natural and intensive pastures) had a \n\nsoil P content clearly above the P concentrations that limit AMF colonisation and within \n\nthe P concentrations that limit plant growth (P&lt;10 ppm). Miller (2000) has speculated \n\nthat the narrow ranges of P (0\u201335.8 ppm and 2.5\u201315.7 ppm, respectively) in their study \n\nsites caused the lack of a significant correlation between AMF colonisation and soil P. \n\nJohnson et al. (2003) reported an increased allocation to AMF structures with nitrogen \n\nenrichment in mesic grasslands where ambient soil nitrogen was highest and \n\nphosphorus availability lowest. These same authors point out that AMF responses to N \n\nand P enrichment are mediated by ambient N and P availability, and this response \n\ncould be caused by allocation plasticity within individual AM fungal taxa, changes in the \n\nspecies composition of the AMF community, or both. \n\nBecause the soil P levels are so low, and the range in soil P is so small in our study, it is \n\nnot possible to speculate on whether or not large fluxes of P in other pastures habitats \n\nwould significantly influence the extent of AMF colonisation at any given time.  \n\nNevertheless, the presence of two AMF species (G. etunicatum and G. intraradices) \n\nwas negatively correlated with soil P content. This result contrasts with that of Johnson \n\n(1993), who showed that fertilisation of soils tended to decrease the abundance of AMF \n\nspecies such as Scutellospora calospora, and increase others like G. intraradices.  \n\nIn summary, this study shows that AMF diversity did not differ between semi-natural and \n\nintensively managed pastures, and that AMF communities associated with both pasture \n\ntypes are mainly dominated by five Glomus species. All of these species, except G. \n\nmosseae, show seasonal variations that are reflected in the variation of fungal \n\nstructures found at different sampling times. These temporal changes in fungal \n\nstructures are also related with plant phenology, showing that flowering is a time of high \n\nnutrient demand for the plant, which translates into a higher proportion of arbuscules \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0III                  \n\n \n\n131\u00a0\n \n\nand a greater hyphal colonisation.

Introduction \n\nNematodes are a major component of all soil food webs and thus comparisons of \n\nabundance, biomass and community structure can be made across ecosystems \n\n(Brussaard et al., 1997). However, it\u2019s well know the damage that they cause to \n\nagriculture crops, which can be traduced into a decrease of plant productivity, \n\ndisruption of plant nutrient and water transfer, as well as, a decrease of fruit and tuber \n\nquality and size (Sipes and Schmitt, 1994; Cofcewicz et al., 2001). Some studies, also \n\nhave pointed to changes in composition of plant communities as consequence of \n\nfeeding herbivores (de la Pe\u00f1a et al., 2006; Pi?kiewicz et al., 2008; Rodriguez-\n\nEcheverria et al., 2009). \n\nDe la Pe\u00f1a et al. (2006) showed that root feeding herbivores affected not only the \n\nplant performance of Ammophila arenaria in coastal dunes, but at same time altered \n\nthe composition of plant communities. The same authors reported that mycorrhizal \n\ncommunities associated with the roots of A. arenaria were almost represented by \n\nGlomus sp. i.e. the genus with great plasticity to environmental disturb, and probably it \n\nrepresents the fraction of soil that can survive and grow to effect of root feeding \n\nherbivores. Thus, it\u2019s seems that root feeding herbivores may have a selective \n\npressure in AMF communities, benefiting the species considered \u201cgeneralist\u201d at the \n\nexpense of the species classified as \u201crare\u201d (Oehl et al., 2004). \n\n An identical result was also reported by Rodriguez-Echneverria et al. (2009) who \n\nfound that root-herbivores can alter mycorrhizal community associated to A. arenaria, \n\nalthough the total percentage of root colonisation is not affected by its presence. Since \n\nthe degree of sensitive to herbivory varies among AMF species, the herbivore effect \n\ncould benefit some AMF species in detriment of the other in terms of root colonisation. \n\nVarious physical, chemical, and agronomic measures have been proposed to control \n\nroot-nematode disease (van der Putten et al., 2006). Chemical nematicides are most \n\neffective in inhibiting nematode infestations but most of the active ingredients are \n\nprohibited due to their detrimental effects on human health and the environment. \n\nAgronomic practices including crop rotations, fallow, and cover crops can also reduce \n\ndisease incidence but these methods are difficult to practice under Chinese conditions \n\ndue to the limited land area and intensive cultivation systems. Biological control \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0IV____________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0__________________________________\u00a0_________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0______________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n136\u00a0\n\ntechniques are preferable because of their limited effects on the environment and the \n\nland can be used continuously for economic production. \n\nArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are ubiquitous plant mutualists which represent a \n\nlarge fraction of fungal biomass of the rhizosphere. These symbiotic organisms are \n\nfound inside roots, in the rhizosphere itself and in the bulk soil, interacting in all these \n\nzones with other organism (Fitter and Garbaye, 1994; Azc\u00f3n-Aguilar et al., 2002). The \n\ninternal mycelium interacts principally with the root itself, but at the same time with \n\nother organism even pathogens fungi. The AMF external mycelium developed in the \n\nsoil helping plant nutrient and water uptake, interacts with many organisms such \n\nbacterial, other fungi, protozoa, nematodes, arthropods and even large animal as \n\nmammals (Fitter and Garbaye, 1994; Azc\u00f3n-Aguilar et al., 2002). Then, it\u2019s well \n\nevident the several benefits that AMF may provide to their host plants, including better \n\nphosphorus (P) nutrition (Jaizme-Vega and Azc\u00f3n-Aguilar, 1995; Guissou, 2009), \n\nincreased abiotic stress (Aug\u00e9, 2004; Smith et al., 2009) and increased disease \n\nresistance (Jaizme-Vega et al., 1998; Idoia et al., 2004; Al-Askar and Rashad, 2010). \n\nDue to these beneficial effects of AMF on host plants, they are suggested to have the \n\npotential to serve as both biological fertilisers and biological control agents (Barea et \n\nal., 2005; Mukhopadhyay and Maiti, 2009).  \n\nBoth arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and root knot nematodes are indigenous soil \n\norganisms and share plant roots as resources of food. Consequently, there is interest \n\nin AM-nematode interactions because of the possibility of enhanced resistance or \n\ntolerance of AMF- infected plants to nematodes (Whipps, 2001; Hol and Cook, 2005). \n\nThe mechanism proposed to explain this protective effect includes: direct competition; \n\nmechanism mediated by alteration in plant growth, nutrition and morphology; \n\nbiochemical and molecular changes in mycorrhizal plants that induce pathogen \n\nresistance, and alterations in the soil microbiota and development of pathogens \n\nantagonism (Azc\u00f3n-Aguilar et al., 2002; Vierheilig et al., 2008). \n\nHowever the control mechanisms of root-feeding nematodes appear to be dependent \n\non the feeding type of the nematode i.e. if they are ectoparasites, sedentary \n\nendoparasites or migratory endoparasites (Borowicz, 2001; Hol and Cook, 2005; \n\nWehner et al., 2010), as well as, on the species of nematode (de la Pe\u00f1a et al. 2006; \n\nPi?kiewicz et al. 2008). In general interactions between AMF and ectoparasitic \n\nnematodes are less strong than those endoparasites, because ectoparasites feed on \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0IV\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n137\u00a0\n\nsuperficial cells, and do not reach the cortical cells colonised by AMF. Thus, \n\nectoparasitc nematodes are more likely to be affected indirectly by AMF-induced \n\nchanges in plant physiology than directly by competition with the fungus (Hol and \n\nCook, 2005). Sedentary endoparasites include two nematodes groups \u2013 root-knot and \n\ncyst nematodes, both induce changes in plant cells and feed on modified cells. The \n\nfeeding cells induced within the vascular cylinder by these endoparasites may invade \n\nthe endodermis and proliferate into the cortex, where we can find the cells colonised \n\nby AMF, occurring competition by space between these two organisms (Hol and Cook, \n\n2005). \n\nFinally de migratory endoparasites, such as root-lesion and burrowing nematodes feed \n\nand move within the cortex, thus they can feed on cells appropriate for AMF \n\ncolonisation (Hol and Cook, 2005). On the other hand, AMF can change root \n\nmorphology with consequences for penetration and movement of migratory \n\nnematodes. AMF will colonize much faster than nematode resulting in alteration of root \n\nphysiology of host like increasing wall thickness and changing the chemical \n\ncomposition of root exudates. \n\nMuch work has been done on AMF-nematode interactions especially on specific \n\ngroups on nematodes, i.e. root-knot (Meloidogyne spp.) and root lesion (Pratylenchus \n\nspp.) nematodes given its economic importance. AMF have interactions with root \n\nnematodes of many crop plant species including fruit tree (Pinochet et al., 1996; \n\nJaizme-Vega et al., 2005) banana (Jaizme-Vega et al., 1997; 2005), tomato \n\n(Cofcewicz et al., 2001; Shreenivasa et al., 2007) and cucumber plants (Zhang et al., \n\n2009).  \n\nJaizme-Vega et al. (1997) noted that inoculation with Glomus mosseae favours growth \n\nof banana plants by enhancing plant nutrition and by suppressing M. incognita \n\nreproduction and galling during the early stages of plant development. Shreenivasa et \n\nal. (2007) also reported that decrease on plant height, dry biomass weight as well as \n\nfruit weight in tomato plants infected with root-knot Meloidogyne incognita was \n\nminimized in presence of AMF. \n\nJaizme-Vega and Pinochet (1997) point out that mycorrhizal inoculation on the first \n\nstages of banana\u2019s development could increase host tolerance to P. goodeyi by \n\nenhancing plant nutrition and by reducing the nematode induced lesions in the root. \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0IV____________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0__________________________________\u00a0_________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0______________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n138\u00a0\n\nAlso Elsen et al. (2008) noted that AMF have the ability to induce systemic resistance \n\nagainst plant parasitic nematodes in banana root system, since AMF reduced more \n\nthan 50% the populations of two nematode Radopholus similis and P. coffeae. \n\nLikewise, Rodriguez-Echeverria et al. (2009) showed in inoculation experiment that \n\nAmmophila arenaria roots infection by P. penetrans and P. dunensis was reduced in \n\nall mycorrhizal plants when compared to no-mycorrhizal plants. \n\nThe Azores archipelago has an extensive area of pastures, in these agroecosystems, \n\nherbivorous nematodes take up as much as one quarter of the net primary production \n\n(Stanton 1988). Rosa et al. (1996) in a study aiming to harvest and genetic \n\ncharacterization of entomopathogenic agents in the Azores, namely in Terceira, \n\nreported that 33.7 % of soil samples showed nematodes, most of them of free living \n\nand phytoparasitic, and 20% of which had been collected in pastures. In Azores \n\nevident effects of endoparasite nematodes, especially root-knot, have been detected \n\nin some horticulture crops such banana (Musa sp.), cucumber plants (Cuccumis melo \n\nL.) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), but there is no peer-reviewed on subject. \n\nThe first record of M. incognita in Azores islands, especially in S. Miguel, was made by \n\nVovlas et al. (2004) in tabaco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). Little is known about how the \n\nvariation of these plants along their range affects their relationship with root-feeding \n\nnematodes, as well as, with their symbiotic organism like AMF. This way, would be \n\ninteresting to evaluate the potential contribute of indigenous AMF not only on \n\nnematode control but also in increasing productivity of these crops. Thus, a study was \n\ndeveloped to assess the contribution of AMF in reducing nematode infection and \n\nreproduction by using Holcus lanatus, due its extensive occupation in Azorean lands \n\n(Dias, 1996; Silva and Smith, 2006; Kueffer et al., 2010). \n\n \n\n2. Material and methods \n\n2.1. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi \n\nIn July of 2006, soil was collected from the rhizosphere of ten different H. lanatus \n\nplants in Pico Galhardo (PX), Terra Brava (TB), Agualva RP1 (RP1) and Agualva \n\n(RP2) and used to set up trap cultures of the AMF community. The fresh soil samples \n\nwere mixed with autoclaved sand and \u201cbagacina\u201d (volcanic soil type) in a ratio of 2:1:1. \n\nA 1.5-kg aliquot of the mixture was placed in each pot to produce trap culture from \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0IV\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n139\u00a0\n\neach sample. Corn (Zea mays L.) was used as host plant. Seeds of corn were surface \n\nsterilised by immersion in alcohol (96 %) for 30 sec, 4 % bleach for 2 min, and rinsed \n\ntwice in sterile distilled water. Then, they were sown in pots on sterilized sand soil and \n\nleft to germinated in the greenhouse. After one week of growth, seedlings were \n\ntransplanted to pots containing the fresh soil samples mix. A total of 4 seedlings were \n\nused per plot. Trap cultures in 40 plots were grown in glasshouse for 5 months and \n\nthen harvested. All pots were watered every 2 days with distilled water, and no nutrient \n\nsolution was added to the pots. After 4 month of sowing we left watering the pots to \n\nstimulate the sporulation. \n\n \n\n2.2. AMF root colonisation assessment \n\nAfter 5 months, plants were harvested and root examined to confirm AMF colonisation. \n\nA portion of roots were cleared in 2.5% KOH for 1h at 90 ?C. Subsequently they were \n\nleft to acidify overnight in 1% HCl. Staining was done with blue ink (Parker Quink) for \n\n30 min at 60 ?C, followed by distaining  in lactoglycerol. The amount of colonisation \n\nwas estimated using a grid-intersect method with examination of 100 intersects under \n\na compound microscope at 200x magnification (McGonigle et al., 1990). Root-\n\nintersects that contained vesicles, arbuscules or hyphae were scored as mycorrhizal. \n\nThe remaining corn roots were cut into 2-cm pieces, and disinfected by immersion in 2 \n\n% chloramines T for 3 min and in an antibiotic solution (streptomycin 200 mg l-1 + \n\npenicillin 100 mg l-1) for 3 h. After this time root were rinsed in autoclaved water and \n\ndried (de la Pe\u00f1a et al., 2006). \n\n \n\n2.3. Spore assessment \n\nAMF spores produced in the trap culture were extracted by sieving and decanting \n\n(Gerdemann and Nicolson, 1963). The procedure included the passage of 50 cm3 of \n\nharvested trap culture substrate from each pot through 1000-, 500-, 250-, 100-, and 45 \n\n\u00b5m sieves. The material retained in 250 \u00b5m, 100 \u00b5m and 45 \u00b5m was collected to \n\ndifferent petri dish and AMF spores were counted under a stereoscopic microscope \n\n(Leica MZ 12). Spores from 4 genera were detected in trap culture, namely \n\nAcaulospora, Ambispora, Glomus and Scutellospora.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0IV____________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0__________________________________\u00a0_________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0______________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n140\u00a0\n\n2.4. Nematode inoculation procedure \n\nThe nematode inoculum consisted of a population of Meloidogyne incognita isolated \n\nfrom a culture of tomato originally collected in the North-East of Tenerife (Valle de \n\nGuerra). The nematode inoculum was prepared by macerating infected roots in a \n\nblender for 15 s at 14 500 rpm in a 0.12 - 0.15% NaClO solution (Hussey and Barker, \n\n1973). Eggs and juveniles (J2) were collected using a 25-\u00b5m-pore sieve and rinsed \n\nwith tap water. The inoculum was adjusted to deliver a suspension of 1150 nematodes \n\nper plot through two 3 cm deep holes located at 5 cm distance from the base of the \n\nplant in the nematode treatments. \n\n \n\n2.5. Experiment \n\nSeeds of H. lanatus were surface sterilised by immersion in 96% alcohol for 30 sec, \n\n0.4% sodium hypochlorite for 2 min and rinsed twice in sterile distilled water. They \n\nwere then sown in boards on a sterilised sand soil and left to germinate in greenhouse. \n\nAfter 2 week of growth, seedlings were transplanted to the pots. Four seedlings of H. \n\nlanatus were planted in 2-l pots filled with a pasteurized substrate contained, soil, sand \n\nand \u201cbagagina\u201d (volcanic soil type) in a ratio of 2:1:1 soil.  \n\nThe experiment include four treatments with 14 replicates per treatment: an \n\nuninoculated control (C), inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), \n\ninoculation with M. incognita (Mi), simultaneous inoculation with AMF and M. incognita \n\n(AMF + Mi). At the time of H. lanatus seedling transplantation\u2019s each pot for inoculation \n\nwith AMF, as well as, for combined inoculation with AMF and M. incognita received \n\n250 spores and 1g of dried corn roots from trap cultures, which was used as AMF \n\ninoculum. We also inoculated four additional plots with AMF inoculum, to assessment \n\nthe mycorrhizal colonisation after 2 weeks and 4 weeks after inoculation. Plots were \n\ndisposed in the greenhouse in a completely randomised design. Every 2 days pots \n\nwere watered and one time per month they were fertilized with 100 ml of half-strength \n\nmodified (P-free) Hoagland\u2019s solution. Afterwards, the H. lanatus seedlings were left to \n\ngrowth for 6 additional weeks to obtain roots enough to split.  \n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0IV\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n141\u00a0\n\n \n\n Figure 1.\u00a0 Experimental design in which: Control- non-mycorrhizal plants; HL+AMF- mycorrhizal \n\nplants; H.l+M.i \u2013 plants inoculated with M. incognita; H.l+AMF+m.i- plants inoculated with M. \n\nincognita and AMF. \n\n  \n\nThen, after the AMF colonisation has been confirmed the roots of each plant were \n\nplaced into a new plot with a sterilised mixture composed by sand, \u201cbagacina\u201d and soil \n\nin a ratio of 3:1:1.

Discussion \n\nIn general native AMF reduced M. incognita population in H. lanatus plants. This \n\nconfirmed previous works on a wide variety of crops. Among them, Jaizme-Vega et al. \n\n(1997) reported that the association between AMF and the banana plantlet increased \n\nthe host tolerance to M. incognita, compensating for de damaged caused by \n\nnematode, mainly by enhancing plant nutrition.  \n\nJaizme-Vega et al. (2005) in a study with papaya also showed that M. incognita \n\ninfection was significantly reduced in mycorrhizal plants. Shreenivasa et al. (2007) \n\nfound that application of Glomus fasciculatum increased yield of tomato in plants \n\ninoculated with M. incognita, whose population was reduced about half in the presence \n\nof AMF. \n\nZhang et al. (2009) also reported in a study to investigate the tolerance of cucumber \n\nplants (Cucumis sativus L.) to root-knot nematode M. incognita, that the number of \n\nroot galls and the number of egg masses, eggs and J2 were significantly lower on \n\nplants inoculated with Glomus intradices, indicating that G. intraradices has the \n\npotential to confer enhanced tolerance to root-knot nematode infestation to cucumber. \n\nMany hypotheses have been proposed on the mechanism of the AMF-induced \n\nresistance against plant pathogens (Azc\u00f3n-Aguilar et al., 2002; Hol and Cook, 2005, \n\nVierheilig et al., 2008). Based on our results we can suggest that increased capacity \n\nfor nutrient uptake by the mycorrhizal association may allow host plant to be more \n\nvigorous and, consequently, more resistant or tolerant of pathogen attack (Azc\u00f3n-\n\nAguilar et al., 2002). In fact, root biomass of H. lanatus plants simultaneously \n\ninoculated with AMF and M. incognita was significantly higher than in the others \n\ntreatments. The AMF presence may have promoted this increase in root biomass to \n\ncompensate tissue damage and decay of root sections by the pathogen and \n\nconsequently reduce significantly disease symptoms. This result was consistent with \n\nfound by Cofcewicz et al. (2001) who found that the increase of number of galls in \n\ntomato roots simultaneously inoculated with AMF and M. javanica could be related \n\nwith increase of root systems promote by AMF, which put at disposal of nematode a \n\ngreater number of sites for infection. \n\nFurthermore competition for host colonisation sites and photosynthates may also \n\nexplain our results. Really, the lack of significant differences in AMF root colonisation \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0IV____________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0__________________________________\u00a0_________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0______________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n150\u00a0\n\nbetween mycorrhizal plants and plants with combined inoculation, suggest that there \n\nwas a competitive interaction between M. incognita and AMF on H. lanatus plants by \n\nspace. AMF might occupy infection sites on the root surface needed by M. incognita to \n\npenetrate root, or cells in the root already occupied by the AMF cannot be colonised \n\nany further by the root-knot. This result was consisted to found by others authors. \n\nBetween them, de la Pe\u00f1a et al. (2006) reported that when both AMF and P. \n\npenetrans were together in the same root compartment of A. arenaria occurred \n\ncompetition between these organisms, although root colonisation by AMF was not \n\naffect the nematode. Also Rodriguez-Echeverria et al. (2009) showed that suppression \n\nof P. penetrans and P. dunensis could be explain trough direct competition, one time \n\nthis is one of the mechanisms which regulated the relative abundance of nematodes in \n\nthe rhizosphere of A. arenaria.  \n\nAdding like AMF, M. incognita growth also depends on carbon from photosynthesis. \n\nSince plants colonised by AMF much carbon is used by the symbiotic AMF, less \n\ncarbon could be available for nematode colonisation (Azc\u00f3n-Aguilar et al., 2002; \n\nVierheilig et al., 2008). Our findings were similar to the results obtained by Osman et \n\nal. (1991), who associated the decreased of M. incognita population in Phaseolus \n\nvulgaris colonised by AMF, to a mechanism of competition for space and food supply \n\nin the root systems between the two organism. Also Jaizme-Vega et al. (1997) point \n\nout that the suppression of M. incongnita on micropropagated banana inoculated with \n\nGlomus mosseae could be associated with competition for space or physiological \n\nchanges in the root that make it an unfavorable food source for the nematode. \n\nA significant increase on plant growth was observed in mycorrhizal plants compared to \n\nthe others treatments, which is in agreement as observed in other work (Jaizme-Vega \n\nand Azc\u00f3n-Aguilar, 1995; Regvar et al., 2003; Al-Askar and Rashad, 2010).  \n\nRegvar et al.(2003) showed that an indigenous mixture of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi \n\n(AMF) containing Glomus mosseae, Glomus fasciculatum, Glomus etunicatum, \n\nGlomus intraradices and Scutellospora sp. significantly increased the plant biomass \n\nparameters of pepper, and parsley and the root biomass of carrots. \n\nThe main AMF benefits to the plants it\u2019s the growth improvement due to enhanced \n\nnutrient uptake, particularly immobile nutrients like phosphorus, because the hyphae \n\ncan reach farther that the nutrient depleted zones that build up around plant roots \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0IV\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n151\u00a0\n\n(Smith and Read, 1997; Clark and Zeto, 2000). Furthermore, in mycorrhizal plants \n\nnematode presence did not appear to have affected plant development. In fact, either \n\naerial fresh weight or total fresh weight and dry weight of H. lanatus plants \n\nsimultaneously inoculated with AMF and nematode were higher than in non-\n\nmycorrhizal plants or in plants only inoculated with nematode. A same result was \n\nfound by Shreenivasa et al. (2007) who reported that maximum plant height, dry shoot \n\nand root weighties, as well as, total dry weight and fruit weight per plant were higher in \n\ntomato plants simultaneously inoculated with Glomus fasciculatum and M. incognita \n\nthan in control or in plant only inoculated by nematode. \n\nThis study concludes that inoculation with native AMF could be a new nematode \n\nmanagement approach in Azores ecosystems by increasing plant resistance (a case \n\nof induced resistance) to the nematode where root galling and nematode reproduction \n\nis negatively affected and plant growth enhanced by the endophyte. However, due to \n\nthe complexity of AMF-nematode interactions more nematodes species should be \n\ntested and the mechanism need to be further elucidated. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0V\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n153\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n  \n\nCHAPTER V.

Introduction \n\nAssociations between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are common in \n\nnatural and agricultural ecosystems (Smith and Read, 1997). In this intimate \n\nassociation the obligate biotrophic fungi supply inorganic nutrients to plants in return to \n\nphotosynthates. Thus, the main benefit of AMF to their host is principally the increased \n\nuptake of relatively immobile phosphate ions, due to the ability of the hyphal network \n\nto grow beyond the phosphate depletion zone that quickly develops around the root \n\n(Smith and Read, 1997). However these fungi can also provide many other benefits to \n\nthe host as: increased resistance to foliar-feeding insects ( Wearn and Gange, 2007), \n\nimproved drought resistance (Aug\u00e9 et al., 2001), increased resistance to soil \n\npathogens (Filion et al., 1999; Borowicz, 2001; Idoia et al., 2004) and increased \n\ntolerance to salinity and heavy metals (Al-Karaki et al., 2001; Mohammad et al., 2003). \n\nIncreased uptake of macronutrients other than P, including nitrogen (N) potassium (K) \n\nand magnesium (Mg) has also been measured (Smith and Read, 1997; Clark and \n\nZeto, 2000) as well as increased uptake of some micronutrients (Ryand and Angus, \n\n2003; Cho et al., 2009). Thus in face of their effects on plant fitness and soil quality, \n\nAMF may play an important role in ecosystems functioning, since their appropriate \n\nmanagement can reduce the use of chemical and energy in agriculture and \n\nconsequently lead to a more economical and sustainable production systems (Barea \n\net al., 2005). Therefore, it\u2019s important to increase our understanding about the \n\necological functioning of these mutualistic microbial symbionts, in order to facilitate its \n\nmanipulation as inoculants because not all plants species form AMF associations and \n\nnot all AMF plant show an evident nutritional improvement from colonisation by AMF \n\nunder all growth conditions (van der Heijden et al., 1998; Hart and Reader, 2002). \n\nAMF show varying degrees of host specificity, even in colonisation ability or \n\nfunctioning, since the outcome of the symbiotic interaction is affected by factors \n\nrelated to host plant and fungal symbiont genotypes (van der Heijden et al., 1998; Hart \n\nand Reader, 2002).  \n\nThe symbiotic performance of AMF isolates depends on two main parameters: \n\ncolonisation ability and efficiency. The rate of colonisation is influenced by the ability of \n\nAMF to spread rapidly and extensively in plant roots, and is affected by factors linked  \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0V___\u00a0_________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0__________________________________\u00a0_________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0______________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n156\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nto spore germination, presymbiotic mycelial growth and appressorium formation (Hart \n\nand Reader, 2002). However, the ability of particular AMF genotype to infect and \n\ncolonise root systems may depend on the presence of particular host plant species \n\n(Croll et al., 2008). Hart and Reader (2002) found that Acaulosporaceae isolates were \n\nsuperior only in presence of Poa annua, a plant species considered as unresponsive \n\nto AMF (Gange et al., 1999; Smith et al., 1999). This suggests that host genotypes \n\ninfluence the response to mycorrhizal symbiosis both in terms of plant growth or \n\nprotections against pathogens (Azc\u00f3n-Aguilar et al., 2002). Thus, depending on the \n\nspecies of plant two general anatomical groups can be distinguished in mycorrhizal \n\ncolonisation, namely Arum-type and Paris-type (Smith and Read, 1997; Brundrett, \n\n2004; Peterson et al., 2004). In the Arum-type arbuscular mycorrhiza, the hypha that \n\npenetrates into the epidermis generally forms a coil either in the epidermal cell or first \n\ncortical cell layer before it enters the intercellular spaces of the cortex. In this type, \n\nroots can become rapidly colonized along the root axis due to the free movement of \n\nhyphae in the intercellular spaces. In the Paris-type mycorrhiza, the intraradical \n\nhyphae pass from cell to cell, forming complex coils in both epidermal and cortical \n\ncells. Species of plants developing Paris-type mycorrhizas lack conspicuous \n\nintercellular spaces in the root cortex so that the growth of hyphae in the longitudinal \n\ndirection of the root is slower than in the Arum-type (Smith and Read, 1997; Brundrett, \n\n2004; Peterson et al., 2004).  \n\nTurn, efficiency of colonisation is correlated with the ability of different isolates to \n\npromote plant growth by improving mineral nutrition and increasing tolerance to biotic \n\nand abiotic stresses (Giovannetti and Avio, 2002; Jakobsen et al., 2002). There is \n\nevidence that intra-family variation in mycelium size and host specificity, may affect the \n\nrelationship between mycelial size and host benefit, indicating that family with the \n\nlargest internal mycelium (Glomaceae) confer the most host benefit.

Growth responses to AMF associations are \n\nmeasured by comparing the growth of plants with and without mycorrhizas in a \n\nparticular soil. (Brundrett and Abbott, 2002). The morphological as well as \n\nphysiological properties of root system can influence the P absorption of plants in soil, \n\nand therefore the beneficial effects observed on mycorrhizal plants. Therefore, root \n\narchitecture and morphology has been as one of the most sensitive indicators of plant \n\nresponse to mycorrhizal. Plants with facultative or non-mycorrhizal mycorrhizal \n\nassociations normally have much finer roots and longer root hairs than obligate \n\nmycorrhizal species. Since relatively less energy is directed to root formation, \n\nmycorrhizal plants showed a greater shoot production, and consequently a lower \n\nroot:shoot ratio in response to a greater increment of shoot mass relative to root mass \n\n(Azc\u00f3n-Aguilar and Barea, 1997). \n\nHowever, despite these discrepancies between different plant growth responses to \n\nAMF, there is some evidence that it may be temporally variable and age-dependent \n\n(Dodd et al., 2000; van der Heijden et al., 2006). Santo-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2007) noted in \n\nsemi-natural grassland that AMF community not only varied significantly among \n\nPrunella vulgaris and Antennaria dioica, but also through growing season. P. vulgaris \n\nshowed a high AMF diversity along the entire growth season while the level of AMF \n\nrichness associated to A. dioica decreased dramatically in autumn. This pattern of host \n\nspecificity has been observed in many systems, including agricultural fields (Douds \n\nand Miller, 1999). Accumulating evidence indicates that mycorrhizal associations can \n\nbe important determinants of diversity in ecosystems and can modify the structure and \n\nfunctioning of plant communities in complex ways (Grime et al. 1987; Wilson and \n\nHartnett, 1997; Van der Heijden et al. 1998; Hartnett and Wilson 1999; Eom et al. \n\n2000; Hart et al., 2003). \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0V___\u00a0_________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0__________________________________\u00a0_________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0______________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n158\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nGrime et al. (1987) found that community structure could be significantly altered by \n\nmycorrhizal activity in species-rich mixtures of plants in experimental microcosm. The \n\npresence of mycorrhizas can increase floristic diversity (Grime et al., 1987) and \n\nspecies richness (Gange et al., 1990). However, this may depend on identity and \n\nmycorrhizal responsiveness of dominant plant species (Smith et al. 1999; O\u2019 Connor et \n\nal., 2002; Vogelsang et al., 2006; Jansa et al., 2008)). Consequently, host-specific \n\nchanges in the AMF community could lead to increases in the relative growth rates of \n\nthe most abundant plant species (i.e., positive feedback) or to decreases in the relative \n\ngrowth rates of the most abundant (i.e., negative feedback). These two dynamics lead \n\nto very different predictions for the community. Positive feedback causes \n\nstrengthening of the mutualism between plant and fungal guilds, but a decline in \n\nspecies diversity. Negative feedback causes a weakening of the mutualism, but can \n\ncontribute to the coexistence of competing plant species (Bever, 2002; Hart et al., \n\n2003). Then, differential responses of AMF to host plant species may play an \n\nimportant role in regulation of plant intraspecific interactions as well as in the \n\ncomposition of plant communities (Hartnett and Wilson, 1999; Smith et al., 1999). \n\nSmith et al. (1999) reported that removal of the dominant warm-season C4 grass \n\nspecies in tall prairie, which exhibits high mycorrhizal responsiveness, increased plant \n\ndiversity, once the dominant species declined in abundance, and number of \n\nsubdominant cool-season C3 grass and forb species increased in abundance. Thus \n\nAMF may affect plant community indirectly by influencing the pattern and strength of \n\nplant competitive interactions. Eom et al. (2000) also point out that the different level of \n\nresponses of host plant species to mycorrhizas may result in differences in AMF \n\ncommunity structure. The same authors report that four of the host plant species \n\nexamined in their studies, Solidago missouriensis Nutt., Baptisia bracteata Muhl. ex \n\nEll., Panicum virgatum L., and Sporobolus heterolepis (A. Gray) A Gray, are obligate \n\nmycotrophs and are highly responsive to mycorrhizal colonisation. By contrast, Poa \n\npratensis L. is non-mycorrhiza-dependent and shows no significant growth response to \n\nmycorrhizal colonisation. O\u2019 Connor et al. (2002), also found that plant species \n\ndiversity increased when mycorrhizal colonisation was suppressed because growth of \n\nthe highly mycorrhiza-responsive dominant Medicago minima was reduced and \n\nsubordinate plant species were released from competition. More recently, Karanika et \n\nal. (2008) argued that AMF suppression declined the growth of subordinate, more \n\nmycotrphic and P demanding perennial forbs and most legumes with compensatory \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0V\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n159\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nincreases of the less P demanding Doricnium herbaceum L. and less mycotrophic and \n\nP demanding C3 grass.

In the Azores, upland semi-\n\nnatural and intensive pastures are usually dominated by the grass species Holcus \n\nlanatus. In contrast, L. multiflorum and L. perenne are characteristic of lowland \n\nimproved pastures receiving regular imputs of fertilizer (Dias, 1996; Borges, 1999). \n\nThese three plant species are C3 and their mycorrhizal responses may range from \n\nfacultative to non mycorrhizal plants (Wilson and Hartnett, 1998).  \n\nMycorrhizal dependency among species has potentially important applications to \n\nagroecosystems functioning and management.

Corn (Zea mays L.) was used as host plant. Seeds of corn were surface \n\nsterilised by immersion in alcohol (96 %) for 30 sec, 4 % bleach for 2 min, and rinsed \n\ntwice in sterile distilled water. Then, they were sown in pots on sterilized sand soil and \n\nleft to germinated in the greenhouse. After one week of growth, seedlings were \n\ntransplanted to pots containing the fresh soil samples mix. A total of 4 seedlings were \n\nused per plot. Trap cultures in 40 plots were grown in glasshouse for 5 months and \n\nthen harvested. All pots were watered every 2 days with distilled water, and no nutrient \n\nsolution was added to the pots. One month before harvested, we left watering the pots \n\nto stimulate the sporulation. \n\n \n\n2.3. AMF root colonisation assessment \n\nAfter 5 months, plants were harvested and root examined to confirm AMF colonisation. \n\nA portion of roots was cleared in 2.5% KOH for 1h at 90 ?C. Subsequently roots were \n\nleft to acidify overnight in 1% HCl. Staining was done with blue ink (Parker Quink) for \n\n30 min at 60 ?C, followed by distaining  in lactoglycerol. The amount of colonisation \n\nwas estimated using a grid-intersect method with examination of 100 intersects under \n\na compound microscope at 200x magnification (McGonigle et al., 1990). Root-\n\nintersects that contained vesicules, arbuscules or hyphae were scored as mycorrhizal. \n\nThe remaining corn roots were cut into 2-cm pieces, and disinfected by immersion in 2 \n\n% chloramines T for 3 min and in an antibiotic solution (streptomycin 200 mg l-1 + \n\npenicillin 100 mg l-1) for 3 h.

The AMF root colonisation \n\nwas well establish and ranged between 60 % and 30 % in H. lanatus and L. \n\nmultiflorum respectively, and most of the observed fungal structures corresponded to \n\nhyphae and vesicles (Table 1; Fig. 1). Furthermore, percentage of root colonisation by \n\nAMF was strongly affected by the host plant. Thus, we found that AMF total \n\ncolonisation varied significantly with plant spp. (Anova: F= 23.17; d.f.= 2, 39; p&lt;\n\n0.001).

Thus, the aerial fresh weight of L. perenne mycorrhizal \n\nplants ( x = 89.13 \u00b1 6.66) was significantly higher than L. multiflorum mycorrhizal \n\nplants ( x = 44.33 \u00b1 1.28) and control ones ( x = 42.88 \u00b1 0.94) (Tukey multiple \n\ncomparison test p&lt;0.05), but was identical to the aerial fresh weight of H. lanatus \n\nmycorrhizal plants ( x = 86.92 \u00b1 5.05) (Tukey multiple comparison test p&lt;0.05) (Fig. 4 \n\nb). \n\nThe total fresh weight was affected by the presence/absence of AMF and by species \n\nof plants (Table 2). Then, there were significant differences between the 3 species of \n\nplants (two-way Anova: F= 5.63; d.f.= 2, 78; p&lt;0.01) (Table 2) on total fresh weight, \n\nwhich was significantly more high in L. perenne ( x = 141.30 \u00b1 3.78)  than in L. \n\nmultiflorum ( x = 122.91 \u00b1 2.64), but it was identical to H. lanatus ( x = 128.90 \u00b1 5.42)  \n\n(Fig. 4 c). The total fresh weight also varied significantly between the 2 treatments \n\nperformed, but much less markedly (two-way Anova: F= 4.33; d.f.= 1, 78; p&lt;0.05) \n\n(Table 2). In fact, the total fresh weight was higher in mycorrhizal plants ( x = 135.79 \u00b1 \n\n3.81) than in control plants ( x = 126.28 \u00b1 3.08) (Fig. 4 c). However, there were no \n\nsignificant differences of the interaction between the 2 main factors on total fresh \n\nweight (two-way Anova: F= 2.58; d.f.= 2, 78; p= 0.08) (Table 2). \n\nThe aerial dry weight was also significantly affected by the treatments (two-way \n\nAnova: F= 55.78; d.f.= 2, 78; p&lt;0.01), plant species (two-way Anova: F= 55.56; d.f.= \n\n2, 78; p&lt;0.01) as well as, by the interactions between these 2 factors (two-way Anova: \n\nF= 14.03; d.f.= 2, 78; p&lt;0.001) (Table 2). Again, the effect of AMF was evident on this \n\nparameter, i.e. aerial dry weight was significant and positively correlated with the AMF \n\nroot colonisation (r= 0.534, p&lt;0.001). In fact, the aerial dry weight of H. lanatus \n\nmycorrhizal plants was significantly higher than the others combinations ( x = 27.50 \u00b1 \n\n2.58) (Tukey multiple comparison test p&lt;0.05), and the opposite was observed in \n\nrelation to aerial dry weight of L. multiflorum which was significantly lower in non-\n\nmycorrhizal plants ( x = 8.69 \u00b1 0.20) as well as in presence of AMF ( x = 8.71 \u00b1 0.25) \n\n(Tukey multiple comparison test p&lt;0.05) (Fig. 4 d). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0V___\u00a0_________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0__________________________________\u00a0_________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0______________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n170\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n4. Discussion \n \nThe establishment of the AMF in the root cortex is known to change many key aspects \n\nof plant physiology. These include the mineral nutrient composition of plant tissues, \n\nthe hormonal balance, and the patterns of C allocation. Therefore, the AMF symbiotic \n\nstatus changes the chemical composition of root exudates, while the development of \n\nan AMF soil mycelium, which can act as a carbon source for microbial communities, \n\nintroduces physical modifications into the environment surrounding the roots. AM-\n\ninduced changes in plant physiology affect the microbial populations, both \n\nquantitatively and qualitatively, in either the rhizosphere and/or the rhizoplane. \n\nTherefore, the rhizosphere of a mycorrhizal plant can have features that differ from \n\nthose of a non-mycorrhizal plant (Barea et al. 2005). \n\nRoot colonisation percentage \n\nThe three plant species used in this study showed multiple colonisation morphology, \n\ni.e. Arum-type and Paris-type. Thick wall of intercellular hyphae with projections and H \n\nconnections and intercellular vesicles (Arum-type), as well as, intercellular coils and \n\nterminal arbuscules (Paris-type) were observed in the three host plant (Smith et al., \n\n2003). On the other hand, the three plant species displayed different, but well \n\ndescribed physiological alterations as a result of mycorrhizal colonisation. \n\nIn fact, the percentage of colonisation of almost all AMF structures was significantly \n\nhigher in H. lanatus followed by L. perenne and L. multiflorum. Thus H. lanatus and L. \n\nperenne behaved as a typical mycorrhiza-responsive plant species, having relatively \n\nhigh levels of mycorrhizal dependency (40 % and 61 % respectively). Conversely, L. \n\nmultiflorum, was overall less responsive to mycorrhizal colonisation, whereby it had \n\nlower mycorrhizal dependency (approximately 27 %). Smith and Read (1997) reported \n\nthat the extent to which typical AMF colonise root systems varies with species of \n\nplants. Also, Bever (2002) showed in a microcosm experiment evident differences of \n\nhost-specific in the AMF communities between 4 host plants (P. lanceolata, A. \n\nodoratum and P. sphaerocarpon). He reported that biovolume of AMF spores after the \n\nfirst generation was great with Allium and least with Anthoxathum. On the other, it was \n\nalso noted that there are differences in the extent of infection between genotypes of \n\nthe same species (Burleigh et al., 1998; 2002; Croll et al., 2008). Burleigh et al.

The same author noted that M. truncatula \n\ncolonisation by Glomus mosseae resulted in the greatest reduction in MtPT2 and Mt4 \n\ngene expression and the highest level of P uptake and growth, but the opposite \n\noccurred in M. Truncatula root colonisation by Gigaspora rosea. However, little \n\nvariation was detected in the expression of LePT1 and TPSI1 within roots of the seven \n\nmycorrhizas. Mathimaran et al. (2005) observed that host plant was an important \n\ndeterminant of AMF species composition, once Glomus intraradices and Glomus \n\ncaledonium showed significant preferences to leek and sunflower respectively. \n\nRecently, Croll et al., (2008) found that among four different trap host species (Allium \n\nporrum, Plantago lanceolata, Glycine max and Helianthus annuus) the number of AMF \n\ngenotypes was significantly higher in A. porrum and H. annus both with 9 isolates, \n\nthan in G. max and P. lanceolata with 4 and 1 isolates respectively. They concluded \n\nthat this fact could provide in field site a heterogeneous environment, since host plant \n\nmay encourage certain genotypes. \n\nPlant productivity \n\nMycorrhizal colonisation affects a wide range of morphological parameters in \n\ndevelopment root systems, a greater root branching being the most described effect \n\n(Regvar et al., 2003; Cho et al., 2009).  Sohn et al. (2003) reported at transplanting \n\nstage of chrysanthemum plant (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat), that inoculation of \n\nAMF resulted in greater height, number of lateral roots, tap root length, and fresh and \n\ndry weight of shoots and roots compared to non-AMF treatment. Turkmen et al. (2008) \n\nnoted that fresh and dry weights of shoots and roots of pepper seedlings were \n\nincreased in presence of AMF species. However, our result did not agree with the \n\nprevious work, we detected a decrease on fresh root weight of the 3 plants species in \n\nthe mycorrhizal treatment compared to the control. A similar result was also found by \n\nAzc\u00f3n and Ocampo (1981) who reported that mycorrhizal dependency among 13 \n\nwheat cultivars decreased as the root weight increased. Also Saif (1987) noted that  \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0V___\u00a0_________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0__________________________________\u00a0_________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0______________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n172\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\ninoculation with mycorrhizal fungi favored the development of shoots more than roots, \n\nleading to a significant decrease in the root/shoot ratio of fourteen host plants. \n\nAccording to Azc\u00f3n-Aguilar and Barea (1997) plants forming mycorrhizae tend to have \n\na lower root:shoot (R:S) ratio, which means a greater biomass efficiency, since less \n\nenergy is directed to root formation. Using micropropagated pineapple, Guillemin et al. \n\n(1992) were even able to demonstrate the existence of a negative correlation between \n\nthe mycorrhizal effects on root and shoot development. According to the authors, the \n\nhigher the root:shoot ratio, the less efficient the system for shoot production. This \n\nmycorrhizal effect on root development is partly due to architectural changes in the \n\nroot system, as has been demonstrated in particular for micropropagated woody \n\nspecies such as grapevine (Schellenbaum et al., 1991) and Prunus (Berta et al., \n\n1995). These studies show that mycorrhiza formation changes root topology from a \n\nherringbone pattern to a more dichotomous pattern, the latter being more efficient for \n\nscavenging of the soil nutrients. Pacovisky et al. (1986) reported that P-deficient plants \n\nlacking AMF symbiosis tend to have a high root:shoot ratio, which is usually \n\nassociated with nutrient-stressed plants. More recently, van der Heijden et al. (2006) \n\nalso noted in an experimental grassland microcosm with different AMF taxa and host \n\nplants, that root biomass was, on average, 26 % higher in control microcosm \n\ncompared with microcosm inoculated with AMF.  \n\nIt has been well documented that morphology of root is extremely important factor in \n\ndetermining mycorrhizal dependency. Plants with roots that are comparatively thick, \n\nwith little branching and few or no root hairs tend to show greater positive growth \n\nresponses to mycorrhizal colonisation than plants with fine, highly branched long roots \n\nwith numerous root hairs (Hetrick et al., 1992; Wilson and Hartnett, 1998). Research \n\nhas showed that the length and the density of roots hair are indicator of the \n\nmycorrhizal dependency (MD) of plants species or cultivar (Janos, 2007). Our result \n\nfollowed this trend, since fresh root weight was negatively correlated with AMF root \n\ncolonisation, i.e. L. multiflorum had the largest root biomass and it was less \n\nmycorrhizal dependent than H. lanatus and L. perenne. Moreover, a significant \n\ncorrelation between root colonisation and mycorrhizal dependency was observed \n\nwhich may suggest that plant that do not rely on the symbiosis regulate mycorrhizal \n\ncolonisation in some way and, thus, control carbon expenditure of the fungus (Wilson  \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0V\u00a0\n                                                                                               \n\n173\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nand Hartnett (1998). In fact, the three grasses are described as cool-season (C3), and \n\nparticularly L. multiflorum was the less responsive and also the less colonised by the \n\nfungi.  \n\nThe symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) increases the performance of \n\nplants by improving nutrient acquisition, resulting in positive effects on growth and \n\nreproduction (Smith and Read 1997). In fact, the intensity of root mycorrhizal \n\ncolonisation, which quantify the biomass of AMF in plants roots significantly differ \n\nbetween the 3 grasses. The high root colonisation observed in H. lanatus as well as in \n\nL. perenne, although less marked, promoted a significant increase in aerial fresh root, \n\ntotal fresh weight as aerial dry weight. This result could be associated with the \n\nincrease of nutrient uptake by mycorrhizal roots. As the colonisation rate of roots \n\nincreases, a mycorrhizal root system can explore a bigger soil extension. This result \n\nwas consistent to previous works, among them Jaizme-Vega and Azc\u00f3n-Aguilar \n\n(1995) who reported that growth of some tropical and subtropical cultures, like \n\navocado, papaya, pineapple and banana, improved when they were inoculated with \n\nselected AMF during the first phase of growth. Likewise, Regvar et al. (2003) showed \n\na significant increase on biomass parameters of pepper and parsley as a result of \n\nmycorrhizal inoculation. \n\nGuissou (2009) also found a significant increase in shoot growth, total dry weight and \n\nnutrient uptake in seedlings of jujube (Ziziphus mauritiana Lam.) plants as result of the \n\nhigh rate of root colonisation observed in this plant. \n\nConversely, significantly lower total aerial fresh weight was recorded in L. multiflorum \n\nplants inoculated with AMF compared with non-mycorrhizal plants. Reduced growth as \n\na result of mycorrhizal colonisation was also observed in some Tagetes cultivars \n\n(Linderman and Davis, 2004). No effect of root inoculation with Glomus intraradices on \n\nshoot biomass was earlier recorded in Callistephus chinensis grown in P-deficient soil \n\nunder field conditions (Gaur and Adholeya, 2005). It is well known that mycorrhizal \n\ncolonisation can depress plant growth primarily by sink competition for photosynthates \n\n(Douds et al. 1998). Some studies have indicated that plant growth depression due to \n\nmycorrhizal colonisation is attributed to greater carbon expenditure in a colonised root \n\nsystem (Peng et al., 1993).  \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0V___\u00a0_________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0__________________________________\u00a0_________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0______________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n174\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nIn field cultivation mycorrhizal roots can explore more soil volume than non-\n\nmycorrhizal ones, due to their extramatricial hyphae (Sawaki and Saito, 2001); it is \n\nimpossible in pot culture in very limited volume of growing media. Results obtained on \n\nTypha latifolia (Dunham et al., 2003) also suggest that under greenhouse conditions, \n\nAMF act to reduce plant growth despite increased mineral nutrition and photosynthetic \n\nactivity. On the other hand, the time period of seedlings could have been too short to \n\nrecord a higher colonisation percentage, and consequently their effects on aerial \n\nbiomass, since the root system infected normally increases with time sigmoidally \n\n(Smith and Read, 1997). Adding, according to van der Heijden et al. (2006) plant \n\ngrowth responses to AMF were temporally variable and some species obtained the \n\nhighest biomass with different year, thus it may be beneficial for plant to be colonised \n\nby different AMF taxa in different seasons. However, though L. multiflorum is a weakly \n\nmycotrophic plant, there is evidence that it can maintain a viable AMF community in \n\nmonoculture even when more strongly mycorrhizal plants are lacking (Teutsch et al., \n\n2006). \n\nTo sum up, the inoculation with a mix of native AMF inoculum increased plant \n\nproductivity. This agrees with other studies which show that native AMF are important \n\ncontributors to plant biodiversity and ecosystem productivity (van der Heijden et al., \n\n1998; Requena et al., 2001, Klironomos, 2003; Regvar et al., 2003). Furthermore, our \n\nresults indicate that mycorrhizal inoculated at the first phase of development of the \n\nplant production system confer the greatest benefit to these plant species (Jaizme-\n\nVega and Azc\u00f3n, 1995; Regvar et al., 2003). However, the three grasses responded \n\ndifferently to AMF inoculation indicating that AMF is host-dependent (Eason et al., \n\n1999; Hartnett and Wilson, 1999; Bever, 2002). This result underlines to the impact \n\nthat cropping with a weak or non-mycorrhizal crop may have on AMF colonisation, \n\nnutrient uptake and yield of subsequent AMF reliant crop, especially if it is highly \n\nmycorrhizal dependent (Douds et al., 1997; Miller, 2000).  \n\nOur findings are of crucial importance to the agriculture systems of the Azores \n\narchipelago, a region where more than 80 % of the useful agricultural surface (SAU) is \n\noccupied by permanent pastures, where L. perenne and H. lanatus are the dominants \n\nplant species (Dias, 1996; Borges, 1997; Lopes, 1999).

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonise \n\nplant roots and contribute to the mineral nutrient uptake of the hosts in exchange for \n\ncarbohydrates. AMF species diversity and identity was reported to have a decisive \n\ninfluence on the composition and productivity of natural plant communities. Only \n\naround 200 glomeromycotan species described so far were thought to colonise the \n\nmajority of higher plant species and thus, their host specificity was thought to be very \n\nlow. Determining how AMF biological communities are assembled and the factors that \n\ninfluence its distributions are fundamental challenges in ecology. \n\nIt is well documented that agricultures practices can affect the structure of arbuscular \n\nmycorrhizal communities. These changes reflect not only in species diversity but also \n\nin species composition, with the most of studies indicating a decrease with the level of \n\nland use intensification. However, our study showed that diversity of AMF spores as \n\nwell as the diversity of AMF on Holcus lanatus L. roots did not change between the \n\nsemi-natural and intensive land uses. The absence of different patterns of AMF \n\nspecies diversity, between the two land uses types could be related with the low level \n\nof land use intensification. In fact, it is known that the input of fertilisers and pesticides \n\nand several other management practices (e.g. grazing intensity) are important in \n\ndefining the quality of the pasturelands for AMF. However, the input of fertilisers to \n\nAzorean pastureland is lower than average inputs to pastures on the European \n\nmainland, which enables the occurrence of endemic species even in most intensive \n\nland uses. On the other hand, striking differences in AMF spore composition were \n\nfound between semi-natural and intensive land uses. Species in Glomus were \n\ndominant in intensive pastures, not only as reproductive spores but also in roots of H. \n\nlanatus, which conferred its status of \u201cgeneralist\u201d species due its high ecological \n\nplasticity occurring in a wide range of habitats inclusive in the most disturbed. In \n\ncontrast, Acaulospora and Scutellospora were the two most representative genera in \n\nsemi-natural pastures. Many of these species appeared to prefer or even to be \n\nrestricted to a land use intensity or field site, and thus characterised as \u201cspecialist\u201d. \n\nThis was the case for most species of Acaulospora sp. and Ambispora sp. only found \n\nin semi-natural land use, while Glomus etunicatum and Paraglomus sp. just found in \n\nintensive ones. This suggests that these species have specific and rather narrow \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0VI_____\u00a0\u00a0________________\u00a0____________________________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_______________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n180\u00a0\n\nniches. Distinct colonisation strategies adopted by AMF, even at family level and \n\nnutrient availability could explain these differences on species composition between \n\nland uses. Members of Glomaceae have a highly infective extra-radical mycelium that \n\ncould allow colonising immediately plant roots. Hence, G. mosseae and G. etunicatum \n\ndominance may be related to competitive advantages for carbon uptake, which make \n\nthem the most effective competitor due to its fast rate of colonisation and early peak in \n\ncolonisation. Moreover, Glomus forms anastomose between mycelia therefore has the \n\nability to re-establish an interconnected network after mechanical disturbance. \n\nConversely members of Gigasporaceae, those are only capable of propagation via \n\nspore dispersal colonise plant roots more slowly than members of Glomaceae. \n\nIn order to better understand the role of AMF in natural ecosystems, as well as their \n\nbasic biology, it is important to document seasonal changes of mycorrhizal \n\ncolonisation. The fungal structure quantification in H. lanatus roots such as arbuscules, \n\nvesicles and hyphae was higher in semi-natural land use than in intensive ones, and \n\nshowed a marked seasonality. This could be related with plant phenology and \n\nmetabolic pathway, as well as with climatic conditions. Fungal structures were more \n\nabundant in the summer, the season with high temperature as well as solar radiation. \n\nMoreover, the higher abundance of fungal structure in H. lanatus root during this \n\nseason could be related with plant phenology. This period matches with the start of the \n\nreproductive phase of Holcus lanatus at the sites. During flowering and/or fruiting the \n\nphosphorus demand is high and thus AMF colonisation levels were also high. This can \n\nalso be demonstrated by higher percentage of AMF arbuscules colonisation during this \n\nseason. Arbuscules are the place for exchange of nutrients between plant and fungus, \n\nand its high percentage of colonisation indicates an intense symbiotic activity.  \n\nNutrient availability also affects the species composition and root colonisation of AMF \n\ncommunities. The density of spore of the most representative genera \u2013 Glomus, \n\nAcaulospora and Scutellospora, was correlated with soil nutrients. The percentage of \n\nAMF root colonisation showed the same pattern. Thus, the improvement of soil fertility, \n\nespecially the availability of K, N, Ca and Mg, provided favourable environment for \n\nmycorrhizal formation and function in these systems. Among soil nutrients, \n\nphosphorus is widely known to inhibit the composition and diversity of AMF \n\ncommunities as well as spore and mycelium densities. However, a correlation between \n\npercentage of AMF colonisation and spore density with soil P content was not found. \n\nThis may be due to low soil Pcontent in semi-natural and intensive pastures, which is \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0VI\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0181\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nabove the P concentrations that limit AMF colonisation and plant growth (P&lt;10 ppm), \n\nthat could affect the absorption of other soil nutrients. Under P limited conditions, the \n\ninvestment of a host plant in AMF genus or species should be strengthened to \n\nmaintain the uptake of limiting nutrients. So, as predicted by the functional equilibrium \n\nmodel, in low P soil, relative allocation to arbuscules, coils and extraradical hypae is \n\ngenerally increased by N enrichment and vice-versa. Then, changes in AMF \n\ncommunity may be explained by changes in the soil N:P ratio. \n\nIn fact, the spore densities of Acaulospora and Scutellospora were positively \n\ncorrelated with N soil nutrient, but the opposite occurred with spore density of Glomus \n\ngenus, which was reflected in a greater abundance of genera Acaulospora and \n\nScutellospora in semi-natural pastures, as well as, in higher abundance of Glomus \n\ngenus in the intensively managed pastures. \n\nThe main AMF benefits to the plants is the growth improvement due to enhanced \n\nnutrient uptake, particularly immobile nutrients like phosphorus, because the hyphae \n\ncan reach farther that the nutrient depleted zones that build up around plant roots. \n\nThus, AMF may play an important role in ecosystems functioning, since their \n\nappropriate management can reduce the use of chemical and energy in agriculture \n\nand consequently lead to a more economical and sustainable production systems. \n\nHowever, host genotypes influence the response to mycorrhizal symbiosis both in \n\nterms of plant growth or protections against pathogens.  According to their response to \n\nmycorrhizal colonisation, host plant can be classified in 3 categories: obligate, \n\nfacultative or non-mycorrhizal depending if they show high, intermediate or non level of \n\narbuscular mycorrhizal colonisation. Mycorrhizal response is usually measured in \n\nterms of mycorrhizal dependency. The tree plant studied \u2013 H. lanatus L., Lolium \n\nmultiflorum Lam. and Lolium perenne L. are facultative mycorrhizal plants, but showed \n\ndifferent degrees of response to native AMF inoculation. L. perenne was the most \n\nmycorrhizal dependent plant, followed by H. lanatus, which reflected in a higher root \n\ncolonisation and thus higher plant biomass production. In contrast, L. multiflorum was \n\nthe less responsive and also the less colonised by the fungi, which resulted in lower \n\nplant productivity when combined with mycorrhiza.  \n\nMycorrhizal dependency among species has potentially important applications to \n\nagroecosystems functioning and management. In the Azores, upland semi-natural and \n\nintensive pastures are usually dominated by the grass species Holcus lanatus. In \n\ncontrast, L. multiflorum and L. perenne are characteristic of lowland improved pastures \n\n\n\nChapter\u00a0VI_____\u00a0\u00a0________________\u00a0____________________________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_______________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n182\u00a0\n\nreceiving regular imputs of fertiliser. Moreover, in lowland during the winter L. \n\nmultiflorum is usually used in crop rotation with Zea mays L. an obligate mycorrhizal \n\nplant. Our findings suggest that in this soil management called \u201coutonos\u201d the AMF root \n\ncolonisation of highly mycorrhizal dependant crop (Z. may), and subsequent \n\nproduction , can be committed due to lower AMF infectivity resulting from the previous  \n\nweak mycorrhizal crop (L. multiflorum).In addition to increased inorganic nutrient \n\nacquisition, other potential benefits of AMF colonisation to host plant include enhanced \n\nresistance or tolerance to biotic stress, such as nematodes and root pathogens. In \n\nfact, the inoculation with native AMF increased the tolerance of H. lanatus to root-knot \n\nMeloidogyne incognita. Among the mechanism proposed to explain the protective \n\neffect of AMF, we suggest that plant growth promotion by AMF, and direct competition \n\nfor host colonisation sites and photosynthates between AMF and nematode were \n\ninvolved.  \n\nAMF indigenous inoculum promoted the growth of the host plant, which was evident in \n\na higher fresh and dry foliar biomass of mycorrhizal plants than in others treatments. \n\nThus, there was an apparent increase in the vigor of the mycorrhizal plants that made \n\nthem more resistant to nematode infection. However, root biomass was higher when \n\nplants were inoculated simultaneously with the two organisms, indicating that in \n\npresence of the nematode, AMF increase root biomass to compensate tissue damage \n\nand decay of root sections by the pathogen and consequently prevent significantly \n\ndisease symptoms.  \n\nBoth AMF and root-knot M. incognita share the same ecological niche, i.e. root of host \n\nplants. However, the nematode presence did not cause a decrease on mycorrhizal \n\ncolonisation, indicating that probably a competitive interaction occurred between these \n\ntwo organisms on H. lanatus roots by space. On the other hand, as in mycorrhizal \n\nplants much carbon is used by the symbiotic AMF, less carbon could be available for \n\nnematode colonisation, preventing the infection by the nematode. \n\n \n\nThis was the first study about AMF community structure in Azores. It provides basic \n\ninformation about AMF species diversity and composition in semi-natural and intensive \n\npastures of Azores, as well as the main factors that can contribute to differences \n\nbetween them. Moreover, the results also underline to the role of indigenous AMF as \n\npotential inoculums in pastures, either by its contribute to plant productivity or \n\nprotection against nematodes. Thus, the correct use of AMF will help to decrease \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\u00a0VI\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0183\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nfertiliser input yet maintain the same level of growth and production, which will be the \n\ncrucial importance from the point of view of sustainable agriculture.
