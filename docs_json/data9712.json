(Vail et al., 2001; Rallis et al., \n1992). The classification can be made on the \nbasis of anatomic location and histological \ncriteria. The most common anatomic forms of \nlymphoma include the multicentric, cranial \nmediastinal, gastrointestinal, and cutaneous. \nPrimary extranodal forms such as those \noccurring in the central nervous system (CNS), \n\neyes, bone, testes, and nasal cavity are less \ncommonly observed (Vail et al., 2001; Sequeira \net al., 1999). This paper describes a multicentric \nlymphoma with metastasis in the CNS. \n \n \n\nCASE REPORT \n \nA two-year-old, female Labrador retriever was \npresented with a history of lethargy, respiratory \ndistress, dysorexia, abdominal enlargement with \n20 days of evolution. Physical examination \nrevealed generalized lymphadenopathy, mucous \n\n\n\nAptekmann et al. \n\nArq. Bras. Med. Vet. Zootec., v.57, n.3, p.307-311, 2005 308 \n\nmembrane pallor, hepatomegaly and \nsplenomegaly and muffled heart and lung \nsounds.  \n \nHematological examination showed normocytic \nnormochromic anemia and leukocyte and platelet \ncounts within the reference range (Jain, 1993). \nSerum biochemical analysis showed elevated \nserum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline \nphosphatase (ALP) and ?-glutamyl transferase \n(GGT) activities and a decrease in total serum \nprotein and albumin. Urinalysis and creatinine, \nurea and calcium serum levels were normal. \nHepatosplenomegaly, pleural effusion and a \ncranial mediastinal mass were evident on \nabdominal and thoracic radiographs, \nrespectively. Lymph node cytology was \ndiagnostic for lymphocytic lymphoma. The \nimmunophenotype of the tumor showed T-cell \norigin with CD3+ e CD 79- expression. \nImmunohistochemistry techniques were \ndeveloped in Immunohistochemical Laboratory \nof the Pathology Service in UNESP. It was used \nthe immunoperoxidase techniques, in agreement \nwith Hsu (1981), using lymphoid anti-CD3 \nmarker (Dako A0452), a polyclonal antibody, for \nT-cells and anti-CD79a (Dako M7051) marker, a \nmonoclonal antibody, and for B-cells (Moura et \nal., 2001). \n \nTreatment with systemic chemotherapy was \ninitiated in an attempt to induce remission using \ncyclophosphamide1, vincristine2 and prednisone3 \n(COP) in doses recommended in the literature \n(Vail et al., 2001). Besides, nutritional \nmanagement was established to provide specific \noncology nutritional support and to reduce \ntoxicity associated with chemotherapy (Ogilvie, \n1998). Diet with low levels of simple \ncarbohydrates and moderate levels of high-\nquality protein, fiber and fat was established. \n \nIn the course of five weeks, the dog was healthy, \nexcept after chemotherapy administration, when \nit presented vomiting and anorexia during one or \ntwo days. A complete blood count was \nperformed periodically to control drugs side \neffects, as myelotoxicity. Antibiotics and \nimmunomodulatory drugs were given when \nnecessary. \n\n                                                 \n1 Genuxal\u00ae50mg, Asta M\u00e9dica, Brasil  \n2 Tecnocris\u00ae 1mg, Zodiac, Brasil \n3 Prednisona\u00ae 20mg, Neo-Qu\u00edmica, Brasil \n\nAfter the fifth week, the dog had signs of head \ntremoring (partial seizure), anorexia, lethargy \nand vomiting. Results of routine hematological, \nurinalysis and blood gas analysis showed normal \nvalues. The biochemical analysis revealed \nhypocalemia. Symptomatic and support \ntreatment was accomplished. The dog was \ntreated with fluid therapy (Ringer\u2019s solution) \nadded with KCl 19.1%. Metoclopramide and \nranitidine were administered for vomiting control \nand ampicilin for prevention of systemic \ninfections.  \n \nDespite the treatment, the clinical signs of the \ndog continued to get worse. After two days, \nneurological examination showed progressive \nneurological deficits, hyperesthesia, ataxia \nfollowed by tetraplegic, intention tremors, \nbehavioral changes (depression), hyperreflexia \nand horizontal nistagmus with the last phase to \nthe right. Cranial nerve examination was \nabnormal with hyposmia, menace reaction and \nfacial reflex decreased. An ophthalmic \nexamination was performed and did not reveal \nany abnormalities. \n \nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected from the \ncerebellomedullary cistern. CSF analysis \nrevealed elevated nucleated cell count and \nprotein concentration. Cytological examination \nrevealed a population of lymphoid cells with \nmarked anisocytosis and anisokaryosis, evident \nnucleoli, basophilic cytoplasm and atypical \nmitotic figures (Fig. 1). \n \nThe previous chemotherapy was suspended and a \nlomustine1 (CCNU) protocol was established in \nagreement with the literature (Fan and Kitchell, \n2000). Because of the rapid course of the disease, \nthe poor prognosis and worsening of the clinics \nsigns, the animal was sacrificed after two days of \nthe CCNU protocol, with agreement of the \nowner. \n \nAt necropsy, no macroscopic lesions in CNS \nwere observed, except for the cerebral \ncongestion. Histological examination revealed \nneoplastic lymphoid cell infiltration of the \nspleen, all lymph nodes, cerebellum and \ncerebrum (Fig. 2). \n \n\n                                                 \n1 Citostal\u00ae 40mg, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Brasil \n\n\n\nMulticentric lymphoma with metastasis\u2026 \n\nArq.

Neoplastic cells infiltrate in cerebellum \ngranular layer (HE, 400x). \n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION \n \nLymphoma within the CNS develops most \ncommonly as part of a multicentric or systemic \nprocess (Long et al., 2001), as observed in this \nreport. The clinical signs produced by CNS \ntumors are nonspecific and depend on the \nlocation of the lesion (Fondevila et al., 1998). \nAnimals can present seizures, cranial nerve \ndeficits, paresis, behavioral changes and \nprogressive ataxia (Rosin, 1982; Couto et al., \n1984; Long et al., 2001; Fighera et al., 2002). \nThis dog had neurological signs compatible with \nmultifocal alterations that were confirmed by the \nhistological exam.  \n \nThe characteristics of the CSF in dogs with CNS \nlymphoma include high white blood cell counts \nand protein, and 95% to 100% of abnormal \nlymphoid cells (Couto et al., 1984), as described \nin this case. Histological or cytological \nexamination is probably the most definitive way \nto diagnose lymphoma in CNS (Rosin, 1982); \nhowever, histological examination usually is \nlimited to the necropsy. There are other \ntechniques to diagnose CNS tumors, as \ncomputerized tomography and magnetic \nresonance imaging (Fulton and Steinberg, 1990; \nKent et al., 2001), nevertheless these are not \neasily available in Brazil, yet. \n \nIdentification of the immunophenotype is \nimportant in the prognostic and has become an \nessential step in their classification because of \nthe relationship between biological behavior and \nresponse to therapy. T-cell lymphoma has a \nworse prognosis than B-cell lymphomas. \nAntibody markers to CD3 and CD79a show \ncross-reactivity across species lines of B cells \nand T cells respectively (Milner et al., 1996; \nTeske et al., 1994; Fournel-Fleury et al., 2002). \n \nA wide variety of chemotherapeutic protocols for \nthe management of canine lymphoma, using \nsingle agents or combinations of drugs, have \nbeen effective in inducing remission. However, \nthere is no consensus regarding the optimal \ntreatment in terms of efficacy, patient survival \nand toxicity (Rosenthal, 1990; Rosenthal and \nMacEwen, 1990; Dobson and Gorman, 1994). In \nveterinary patients with multicentric lymphoma, \nit can be used a relatively simple and low-cost \nprotocol, as COP for example (Dobson and \nGorman, 1994; Vail et al., 2001). This is well \n\n\n\nAptekmann et al. \n\nArq. Bras. Med. Vet. Zootec., v.57, n.3, p.307-311, 2005 310 \n\ntolerated by the animals and results in a 60% to \n70% complete response rate with a median \nsurvival of six to seven months (Cotter and \nGoldstein, 1983). The dog presented a good \nresponse until the fifth week of therapy when it \nstarted to show neurological signs. Lomustine \nwas introduced because of its high lipid \nsolubility and ability to cross the blood-brain \nbarrier (Fulton and Steinberg, 1990; Pfaff et al., \n2000; Fan and Kitchell, 2000; Fan et al., 2002). \nDespite of the change in protocol, the lymphoma \nwas in advanced stage and the dog did not \nrespond to the therapy. \n \nThis report is important due to an uncommon \nclinical presentation of a multicentric lymphoma. \nIn spite of the good response to chemotherapy, it \nis essential to follow the clinical signs and \nlaboratorial exams in patients with lymphoma to \nsearch metastasis. Besides, it is essential to make \nCSF analysis and immunophenotype for \ndiagnosis and prognosis of CNS neoplasm.  \n \n \n\nREFERENCES \n \n\nCOTTER, S.M.; GOLDSTEIN, M.A. Treatment \nof lymphoma and leukemia with \ncyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone. \nJ.
