Aprofundar o conhecimento dos impactes destas \n\u00e1reas ao n\u00edvel dos processos hidrol\u00f3gicos e a sua influ\u00eancia na qualidade da \n\u00e1gua superficial, constitui o principal objetivo deste estudo. O trabalho foi \ndesenvolvido numa bacia hidrogr\u00e1fica Portuguesa, com caracter\u00edsticas peri-\nurbanas (Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es), sob a influ\u00eancia do clima Mediterr\u00e2neo. \n \nO estudo considera uma abordagem a v\u00e1rias escalas espaciais e temporais, \nenvolvendo a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de medi\u00e7\u00f5es ao n\u00edvel das propriedades do solo, \nensaios em parcelas experimentais e a monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 escala da bacia \nhidrogr\u00e1fica e sub-bacias. \n \nSolos associados a diferentes usos apresentam distintas propriedades f\u00edsicas \nque determinam a capacidades de infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua, bem como os \nmecanismos de gera\u00e7\u00e3o de escoamento superficial ao longo do ano. Durante \nper\u00edodos secos, a natureza hidrof\u00f3bica dos solos florestais e dos campos \nagr\u00edcolas abandonados, localizados na zona de calc\u00e1rios, promove uma baixa \ncapacidade de infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o da matriz do solo, induzindo a suscetibilidade para a \ngera\u00e7\u00e3o de escoamento do tipo Hortoniano. Contudo, a reduzida repel\u00eancia \nnas \u00e1reas agr\u00edcolas (em zona de arenitos) e as caracter\u00edsticas hidr\u00f3filas dos \nsolos urbanos promovem uma maior capacidade de infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o, o que revela o \npotencial destes solos para a infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o do escoamento gerado em \u00e1reas a \nmontante. Por outro lado, ao longo do per\u00edodo h\u00famido, a repel\u00eancia do solo vai \ndesaparecendo, o que promove o aumento da capacidade de infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o, \nprincipalmente nas \u00e1reas florestais. No entanto, o aumento da humidade do \nsolo restringe a capacidade de infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o nos solos agr\u00edcolas e urbanos, \nfavorecendo a gera\u00e7\u00e3o de escoamento superficial por satura\u00e7\u00e3o, \nprincipalmente em locais de fundo de vale e em encostas calc\u00e1rias de solos \npouco profundos. \n \nAs \u00e1reas florestais apresentam uma elevada capacidade de infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\u00e1gua, mesmo quando a matriz do solo apresenta um elevado car\u00e1cter \nhidrof\u00f3bico, promovida pela presen\u00e7a de macroporos. Todavia, densas \nplanta\u00e7\u00f5es de eucaliptal s\u00e3o menos favor\u00e1veis \u00e0 infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua do que \n\u00e1reas de regenera\u00e7\u00e3o natural de eucalipto e zonas de carvalhos, devido \u00e0 \nmaior repel\u00eancia do solo. \n \n \n \n \n     \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \nO padr\u00e3o clim\u00e1tico, nomeadamente a precipita\u00e7\u00e3o, determina o regime \nhidrol\u00f3gico das bacias hidrogr\u00e1ficas e a qualidade da \u00e1gua superficial. As \ncaracter\u00edsticas f\u00edsicas da bacia, tais como a litologia, tamb\u00e9m afetam os \nprocessos hidrol\u00f3gicos, uma vez que determinam a permeabilidade dos solos \ne o regime h\u00eddrico das linhas de \u00e1gua ao longo do ano. \n \nDurante o ver\u00e3o, o escoamento de base representa uma componente \nrelevante das linhas de \u00e1gua, mas o reduzido caudal promove uma baixa \ncapacidade de dilui\u00e7\u00e3o de poluentes, podendo colocar em causa a qualidade \nda \u00e1gua durante eventos de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o, principalmente devido a \nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es elevadas de car\u00eancia qu\u00edmica de oxig\u00e9nio e nutrientes. Ao \nlongo da \u00e9poca de chuvas, o aumento da conetividade hidrol\u00f3gica entre as \nfontes de escoamento superficial e de poluentes, origina maiores contribui\u00e7\u00f5es \npara as linhas de \u00e1gua. Elevadas cargas de poluentes, nomeadamente s\u00f3lidos \nem suspens\u00e3o, metais pesados e azoto, podem colocar em causa a qualidade \nda \u00e1gua superficial durante maiores eventos de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n \nDe um modo geral, a expans\u00e3o das \u00e1reas urbanas, e particularmente das \nsuperf\u00edcies imperme\u00e1veis, promove o aumento dos coeficientes de escorr\u00eancia \ne origina concentra\u00e7\u00f5es m\u00e9dias elevadas de alguns par\u00e2metros que afetam a \nqualidade da \u00e1gua, tais como nitratos e car\u00eancia qu\u00edmica de oxig\u00e9nio. No \nentanto, os impactes nos recursos h\u00eddricos s\u00e3o determinados pela localiza\u00e7\u00e3o \ndas fontes dentro da bacia hidrogr\u00e1fica. Fontes de escoamento superficial e \npoluentes localizadas em posi\u00e7\u00f5es mais elevadas das encostas podem ter um \nefeito negligenci\u00e1vel nas linhas de \u00e1gua, devido \u00e0s oportunidades de infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o \ne reten\u00e7\u00e3o superficial promovidas pela passagem ao longo da encosta. Por \noutro lado, fontes de escoamento e de poluentes localizadas nas imedia\u00e7\u00f5es \ndas linhas de \u00e1gua originam maiores impactes nos ecossistemas ribeirinhos. A \npresen\u00e7a de sistemas de drenagem de \u00e1guas pluviais aumenta de forma \neficiente a conetividade hidrol\u00f3gica dentro da bacia.   \n \nOs agentes respons\u00e1veis pelo ordenamento do territ\u00f3rio e o planeamento \nurbano devem considerar a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de um mosaico paisag\u00edstico constitu\u00eddo \npor diversos usos do solo, de modo a maximizar a infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua e limitar \na conetividade hidrol\u00f3gica entre as fontes de escoamento e as linhas de \u00e1gua. \nA preserva\u00e7\u00e3o de um regime h\u00eddrico mais aproximado ao de caracter\u00edsticas \nnaturais \u00e9 importante para a minimiza\u00e7\u00e3o do risco de cheia e a degrada\u00e7\u00e3o da \nqualidade da \u00e1gua.   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n\n \n\nPeri-urban, land-use, soil properties, overland flow, flow connectivity, surface \nwater quality.  \n \n\n \n\nabstract \n\n \nPeri-urban areas represent one of the most important development forms. The \naim of this study is to contribute for an improved knowledge about the impact of \nperi-urban areas on catchment hydrology and surface water quality. The \nresearch focus on a Portuguese peri-urban catchment (Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es), \nunder Mediterranean climate. \n \nThe study is based on a spatio-temporal multi-scale approach, involving the \nmeasurement of soil properties, runoff plot experiments as well as catchment \nand subcatchments monitoring. \n \nLand-uses have distinct soil properties which provides different infiltration \ncapacities and mechanisms for generating overland flow over the year. During \nthe summer, the hydrophobic nature of woodland and abandoned agricultural-\nlimestone fields exhibit low soil matrix infiltration capacity, being prone to \ninduce infiltration-excess overland flow. However, wettable urban soils and low \nhydrophobic agricultural fields (overlaying sandstone) have greater matrix \ninfiltration capacity, and can provide infiltration opportunities for uphill overland \nflow. On the other hand, throughout wet season, hydrophobicity switches off \nand matrix infiltration capacity increases under woodland soils. But increasing \nsoil moisture limit the infiltration capacity of agricultural and urban land-uses, \nfavouring saturation-excess overland flow, particularly in valley bottoms and \nhillslope shallow soils overlaying limestone. \n \nEven under widespread hydrophobic conditions in driest settings, woodland \nareas can provide high infiltration through macropores. Nevertheless, dense \neucalypt plantations are less suitable than open eucalypt stands and woodland \nareas, due to most severe hydrophobicity. \n \nClimate pattern, and particularly rainfall, is the most important parameter \naffecting stream flow and surface water quality. Physical characteristics of the \ncatchment, such as lithology are also important in determining soil permeability \nand the temporal stream flow regime.  \n \nDuring the summer, base flow represents a larger percentage of the stream \ndischarge, but the limited flow provide minor pollutants dilution during rainfall \nevents, mainly chemical oxygen demand and nutrients, which may threaten \nwater quality standards. Over the wet season, increasing hydrological   \n \n \n\n            \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \nconnectivity of overland flow and pollutant sources provide greatest stream flow \ninputs. Enhanced pollutant loads, particularly of suspended sediments, heavy \nmetals and nitrogen, can hinder surface water quality during wettest conditions. \n \nGenerally, increasing urban land-use extent, and particularly impervious \nsurfaces, leaded to enhanced runoff coefficients and high mean concentrations \nof few pollutants, specifically chemical oxygen demand and nitric oxide. \nHowever, impacts on stream flow are largely dependent on the source position \nacross the landscape. Overland flow and pollutant sources located upslope \nmay have a minor impact on riverine ecosystems, due to greater infiltration and \nsurface retention opportunities provided by downslope areas. Contrary, source \nareas with greater proximity to the stream network would have major impacts. \nThe presence of urban drainage system can efficiently favour flow connectivity, \nenhancing the impacts on aquatic ecosystems. \n \nLandscape managers and urban planners should employ a mosaic of different \nland-uses, in order to maximize infiltration and disrupt the flow connectivity \nbetween sources and stream network. The maintenance of a more natural \nhydrological regime would be important to minimize flood hazard and preserve \nwater quality.      \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\ni \n\nCONTENTS \n\nLIST OF FIGURES ......................................................................................................... vi \n\nLIST OF TABLES ......................................................................................................... xii \n\nLIST OF ACRONYMS ................................................................................................. xiv \n\nCHAPTER 1 Introduction ................................................................................................ 1 \n\n1.1.

Research scope  \n\n1.1.1. Peri-urban areas \n\nUrbanization has been a worldwide tendency over the last decades (e.g. Duh et al., 2008). \n\nIn 2000 year, people living in urban areas represented 47% of the world\u2019s population, and \n\n75% of European citizens (EEA, 2006). This tendency is expected to continue, with urban \n\npopulation reaching 56% of the world, and 80% of European population by 2020 (EEA, \n\n2006).  \n\nThe increase in urban surface area has been even greater than that of the urban population. \n\nIn countries belonging to EU25, urban areas expanded by 78% between 1950s and 1990, \n\nwhile population increased only 33% (EEA, 2006). This trend continued until 2000, with \n\nmore than 5% increase in urban areas, associated with a lower 2% growth of urban \n\npopulation. This greater increase of urban surface was mainly a result of expansion, \n\nincreased number of households constructed farther away from the city centres (Jansson \n\nand Terluin, 2009).  \n\nThese trends in urbanization have been driven by a mix of forces including both micro \n\nand macro socio-economic trends, such as improved transportation links and enhanced \n\npersonal mobility, the price of land and individual housing preferences (EEA, 2006). \n\nPeople living in the areas surrounding the cities take advantage of more affordable \n\naccommodation than inner urban areas and better quality of life in certain ways \n\n(Oyeyinka, 2008).  \n\nThe transition zones between completely urban and strictly rural landscape, called peri-\n\nurban areas, are responsible for the increased radius of urbanization spanning from inner \n\ncity areas. The word peri-urban is most often used in Europe and Australia, where it refers \n\nto land made of a mixture of natural or agricultural lands and urbanised areas. In USA \n\nand UK, the word suburban is most commonly used, and it generally refers to residential \n\nareas with houses and gardens, but some urban areas are so large that some suburban \n\nareas are now distant from urban boundaries and no longer peri-urban.  \n\nPeri-urban areas are characterized by a wide range of population density (more than 40 \n\ninhabitants per km2), larger than in rural areas, and comprises distinct land-uses, \n\nparticularly associated with different urban features, including residential, commercial \n\nand leisure-related land-uses (Ravetz et al., 2013). These urban settlements may be linked \n\nto dispersed or constrained, scattered or contiguous developments, demonstrating distinct \n\nspatial patterns. Due to its complex pattern, peri-urban areas should not be seen as just a \n\nzone of transition between urban and rural landscape, but rather a new kind of multi-\n\nfunctional territory (Ravetz et al., 2013). \n\n\n\n CHAPTER 1 \u2013 INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n \n\n4 \n\nPeri-urban areas represent a significant part of city land, with almost the same size as \n\nurban areas across Europe (48,000 km2 and 49,000 km2, respectively) (Piorr et al., 2011). \n\nAs Figure 1.1 shows, it is the dominant form of urbanization of the northeast European \n\ncountries (e.g. Poland and Romania) and some southern ones, like Italy. In Portugal, \n\ndespite peri-urban areas being not so widespread, they represent a significant part of the \n\nNorth-Centre and Algarve regions. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 - Location of peri-urban areas across Europe, and percentage cover of the total area \n\n(Piorr et al., 2011). \n\n \n\nAlthough most urban areas across the world are now growing relatively slowly at a rate \n\nof 0.5-0.6% per year (Piorr et al., 2011), but attaining 1.7% per year in developing \n\ncountries (Ravetz, et al., 2013), built development in peri-urban areas is growing at four \n\ntimes this rate (Piorr et al., 2011). This trend is expected to continue in the future (Ravetz \n\net al., 2013; Miller et al., 2014), even in regions where the population is decreasing. This \n\nis particularly the case in some European countries such as Portugal, Spain and in some \n\nparts of Italy (EEA, 2010).  \n\nConsidering the current and potential growth of peri-urban areas, it is important to \n\ndevelop stormwater management strategies to mitigate the impacts of urbanization on \n\nboth water quantity and quality at the catchment scale. The spatial planning of peri-urban \n\nareas represents one of the twenty-first century challenges (Ravetz et al., 2013). \n\n \n\n1.1.2. Urbanization impacts on hydrochemistry \n\n1.1.2.1. Hydrological processes \n\nUrbanization, associated with the conversion of cropland, forestry and grassland into at \n\nleast partly impervious surfaces lead to increasing hydraulic efficiency within the \n\ncatchments. There have been many studies focusing on the hydrologic impacts of urban \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n5 \n\nareas around the world, identifying changes in: 1) evapotranspiration, due to vegetation \n\nremoval (Carlson and Arthur, 2000; Costa et al., 2003) and precipitation changes, allied \n\nto the \u201cheat island\u201d effects (Jauregui and Romales, 1996), 2) decreasing infiltration \n\ncapacity following soil compaction and soil water proofing (Carlson and Arthur, 2000), \n\n3) increasing overland flow and streamflow (Corbetts et al., 1997), and 4) shrinkage of \n\ngroundwater recharge with a corresponding decline in baseflows (Klein, 1979; Smakhtin, \n\n2001; Llorens and Domingo, 2007).  \n\nThe impacts of urbanization on streamflow are also coupled with changes in hydrograph \n\nshape. Since water storage capacity and evapotranspiration decreases in urbanized \n\ncatchments, more rainfall is available for streamflow and the hydrograph rises more \n\nabruptly (Sauer et al., 1983; Rhoads, 1995; Changnon and Demissie, 1996; Konrad, \n\n2002), attaining higher peak flows as imperviousness increase (Espey et al., 1969; \n\nChangnon and Demissie, 1996; White and Greer, 2006). Greater peak flows are linked to \n\ndecreasing return periods (Brath et al., 2006; Ying et al., 2009; Hawley and Bledsoe, \n\n2011) and increasing flood hazard (Hollis, 1975; Swanson, 1998; Wijesekara et al., 2012; \n\nKonrad, 2002; Burns et al., 2005; Chang, 2007; Kjha et al., 2011). Urbanization impacts \n\non hydrograph shape are also associated with steep falling limbs (Burns et al., 2005; \n\nVerbeiren et al., 2013). \n\nThe magnitude of the impacts of urbanization on the water cycle, and particularly on \n\nstreamflow, are highly variable between research studies. Despite consistency as regards \n\ngreater streamflow with increasing impervious surface area, the relationship is not linear. \n\nArrigoni et al. (2010) realized that the most heavily modified catchment does not \n\nnecessarily display the most altered flow regime. Using selected catchments in different \n\nparts of Germany, Tetzlaff et al. (2005) noticed that the magnitude of the flow \n\nacceleration was more influenced by the physical catchment characteristics, e.g. mean \n\nslope and mean elevation, than by urban land-use. Differences in the biophysical \n\ncharacteristics of the catchment, such as geology, lithology, climate and soil properties \n\nalso affect the hydrological processes, and can mask the influence of land-use changes \n\n(e.g. Boyd et al., 1993; Konrad and Booth, 2005). Furthermore, recent studies have been \n\nreporting the influence of urbanization type and its spatial pattern accros the catchment \n\non streamflow response (e.g. Leith and Whitfield, 2000; Pappas et al., 2008; Zhang and \n\nShuster, 2014). \n\nDespite several decades of scientific studies focussing on urbanization impacts on \n\nhydrological processes, peri-urban studies have been few. However, the different \n\nhydrological responses of distinct land-use patterns within peri-urban catchments provide \n\na mix of overland flow sources and sinks, associated with fast and slow water fluxes over \n\nthe landscape. The lack of few hydrological data from peri-urban catchments has been \n\nlimiting the understanding of the impact of the landscape mosaic pattern on rainfall-runoff \n\nrelationships and streamflow response.  \n\n\n\n CHAPTER 1 \u2013 INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n \n\n6 \n\nConsidering the current and potential growth of peri-urban areas, new hydrological data \n\nare required for improved assessement of the influence of different spatial land-use \n\narrangements on flow connectivity. Hydrological connectivity influences water passage \n\nfrom one part of the landscape to another, and thereby determines catchment runoff \n\nresponse and flood hazards (Bracken and Croke, 2007; Borselli et al., 2008; Callow and \n\nSmettem, 2009; Lexartza-Artza and Wainwright, 2009).  \n\nDuring the last decade, the role of hydrological connectivity has become a key issue in \n\ncatchment hydrology, but the spatio-temporal variation of hydrological processes is still \n\nnot well understood (Bracken et al., 2013). In peri-urban areas, flow connectivity \n\nrepresents an additional challenge, considering the different hydrological responses of \n\ndistinct land-uses. Forest areas have a high rainfall retention capacity due to interception \n\nand transpiration process (Legesse et al., 2003; Andr\u00e9assian, 2004; Delgado et al., 2010), \n\nwhereas agricultural fields are subject to annual harvesting cycles, which influence \n\nevapotranspiration and soil permeability (e.g. through compaction), and thus runoff \n\ngeneration (Martin and Shipitalo et al., 2013). Urban areas are organized in complex \n\nstructures, consisting of built-up and green areas, separated by the street network. \n\nDifferent combinations and arrangements of land-uses and types of impervious and \n\npervious surfaces within urban areas, affect the ultimate fate of rain during and after \n\nstorms, influencing the amount of runoff produced and the time at which it is delivered \n\nto other parts of the catchment (Jacobson, 2011). \n\nHydrological connectivity is also affected by antecedent weather conditions, particularly \n\nassociated with soil moisture status, which affect storage capacity (Bull et al., 2003; \n\nEaston et al., 2007). Soil moisture is recognized as a major runoff-controlling factor, \n\nparticularly in regions under Mediterranean climate (Cerd\u00e0, 1997). However, soil \n\nmoisture variation is not entirely understood, particularly in urbanizing catchments where \n\nits spatial and temporal variability are rarely reported (Easton et al., 2007). \n\nKnowledge of runoff processes and flow connectivity across heterogeneous landscapes, \n\nand on their temporal variation under contrasting seasonal conditions, such as in a \n\nMediterranean climate, is of utmost importance for catchment management. \n\nUnderstanding the impacts of land-use pattern on spatio-temporal variation of \n\nhydrological processes is required to improve urban planning and to support water \n\nmanagement decisions, particularly within peri-urban catchments. \n\n \n\n1.1.3. Surface water quality \n\nHuman interference in the natural environment, particularly through urbanization, also \n\ninfluences streamflow chemistry. Different land-uses such as woodland, agriculture and \n\nurban areas, residential, commercial and industrial uses, with different proportions of \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n7 \n\nimpervious and pervious surfaces (e.g. lawns and gardens) generate runoff with specific \n\nphysical-chemical characteristics.  \n\nLand-use properties determine the ability to absorb, release and/or transport different \n\nconcentrations and loads of chemical substances, such as nutrients, heavy metals, \n\nmicroorganisms, pesticides and hundreds of organic contaminants, such as hydrocarbons, \n\nhormones, antibiotics, surfactants, endocrine disruptors, human and veterinary \n\npharmaceuticals (e.g. Goonetilleke et al., 2005; Pal et al., 2014). All these pollutants \n\naffect the physical, chemical, and biological health of a stream, with negative \n\nconsequences for biological habitat, aesthetic value of natural watercourses, and utility of \n\nwater for different purposes, such as human consumption and irrigation, linked to health \n\nhazards (Hammer, 1972; Arnold and Gibbons, 1996; Paul and Meyer, 2001; Brilly et al., \n\n2006).  \n\nMany studies have focused on the impact of different land-uses, particularly agricultural \n\nactivities, and point source discharges on water quality (Compton et al., 2000; Kulabako \n\net al., 2007; Gooddy et al., 2014). Vegetated areas, such as forestry, cultivated fields and \n\nlawns are frequently associated with higher nutrient contributions to the streamflow \n\n(Steuer et al., 1997; Goonetilleke et al., 2005; Groffman et al., 2009), whereas impervious \n\nsurfaces within urban areas and particularly industrial zones are prone to increase levels \n\nof nutrients in rivers and streams (Herngren et al., 2004; Pitt and Maestre, 2005; Zhang \n\net al., 2007; Li et al., 2012). It is usually accepted that pollutant load increase directly \n\nwith the percentage of total impervious area (TIA), and several authors have been \n\nconsidering this parameter has an indicator of the ecological and environmental \n\nconditions of an aquatic system (Schueler, 1994; Arnold and Gibbons, 1996; Paul and \n\nMeyer, 2001; Morse et al., 2003; Kuusisto-Hjort and Hjort, 2013). However, a wide range \n\nof water quality impacts resulting from land-use changes, particularly urbanization, has \n\nbeen reported.  \n\nSurface water quality is driven not only from land-use type but also from land-\n\nmanagement, such as fertilizer and manure application (Gross et al., 1990; Easton and \n\nPetrovic, 2004; Khai et al., 2007; Antonious et al., 2008). The location of pollutant \n\nsources within the catchment and the connectivity with the stream network, driven by the \n\nspatial distribution of different land-uses and the presence or absence of urban drainage \n\nsystem, have been considered as an important parameter determining water quality \n\nimpacts (Booth and Jackson, 1997; Brabec et al., 2002; Ouyang et al., 2009). In urban \n\ncatchments, the connectivity issues can be far more important for water quality than \n\npercentage of impervious surface (Brabec et al., 2002; Wickham et al., 2002; Carey et al., \n\n2011). Furthermore, catchment properties, such as lithology, influence not only the runoff \n\nprocesses and flow connectivity, but can also inprint specif physical-chemical properties \n\non runoff, which affect water quality (Bricker and Jones, 1995; Richards et al., 1996).  \n\n\n\n CHAPTER 1 \u2013 INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n\nThe variation of surface water quality and pollutant loads is also a function of climatic \n\nfactors including rainfall, which influence streamflow variability and thus pollutant loads \n\n(Goonetilleke et al., 2005; Thompson et al., 2012; Rodr\u00edguez-Blanco et al., 2013). \n\nAntecedent weather conditions also affects pollutant deposition at the catchment surface, \n\nresulting mainly from atmospheric deposition, particularly important due to \n\nanthropogenic emissions, such as vehicular traffic and industrial emissions (Bernhardt et \n\nal., 2008; Apeagyei et al., 2011). The length of antecedent dry period (ADP) influences \n\nthe amount of pollutants available to be washed-off during rainfall events, with impacts \n\non streamwater quality (Marsalek, 1976; Vaze and Chiew, 2002; Qin et al., 2013).  \n\nUnderstanding the spatio-temporal dynamic of runoff sources and its physical-chemical \n\nproperties, as well as how connectivity governs pollutants transfer during and between \n\nrainfall events, is limited. Despite several studies focused on the relation between land-\n\nuse and pollutant loadings, as well as the interactions between multiple land covers within \n\na single catchment, outcomes to date have been inconclusive, particularly because of \n\nrelatively scarce hydrologic and water quality data, and thus making it difficult to identify \n\ncause\u2013effect relationships. However, knowledge on pollutant buildup and wash-off \n\nprocesses in distinct land-uses is a key research need.   \n\nFurther investigation is required to better assess the impact of the landscape mosaic on \n\nsurface water quality, particularly in peri-urban areas. This knowledge should guide \n\ndecision-makers and policy actor on sustainable solutions for water quality management, \n\nin order to attain the \u201cgood ecological status\u201d of rivers, as imposed by the European Water \n\nFramework Directive (WFD, 2000). The information of pollutant source areas is \n\nfundamental to develop and implement cost-efficient strategies to improve water quality, \n\nand to move beyond the dependency on customary structural measures and end-of-pipe \n\nsolutions and prevent water quality problems at the catchment and urban planning scale. \n\n \n\n1.2. Aim and objectives \n\nThe main aim of this research is to contribute to assess the impact of a mosaic of different \n\nland-uses on overland flow processes and its contribution to surface hydrology and \n\nstreamwater quality in a Mediterranean climate and socioeconomic setting. The study \n\nfocuses on a peri-urban catchment in Portugal, where this subject has been poorly \n\ninvestigated. The specific objectives are, for this peri-urban context: \n\n1. Assess the spatio-temporal variability of soil hydrological properties in different \n\nland-uses of the mosaic; \n\n2. Investigate how and why overland flow processes and its spatial pattern change \n\nover the year, as a result of the seasonal Mediterranean climate; \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n9 \n\n3. Assess the impact that different landscape patterns, marked by different extent and \n\nlocation of urban areas, have on flow connectivity and stream discharge, and also on \n\nstreamwater quality; \n\n4. Provide some guidelines to improve land management and urban planning on peri-\n\nurban catchments, in order to minimize flood hazards and water quality degradation. \n\n \n\n1.3. Research design \n\nThe research is based on Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es study site, a small peri-urban catchment \n\nundergoing rapid urbanization due to its proximity to Coimbra city centre, the largest city \n\nin the central part of Portugal. The main elements of the research design are shown in \n\nFigure 1.2. In order to fulfil the objectives regarding to the quantification of the \n\nhydrological processes, a combined approach of field data acquisition and analysis was \n\nadopted at different scales: pedon, plot and catchment. This inclusive methodology \n\nprovides a better understanding of the rainfall-runoff processes and the impacts on \n\ncatchment hydrology. Spatio-temporal variation of surface water quality was assessed \n\nusing the same multi-scale approach, but focusing on the sub-catchment and catchment \n\nscales.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 - Research design to assess the impacts of peri-urban areas. \n\n\n\n CHAPTER 1 \u2013 INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n \n\n10 \n\nAt the Pedon scale, in order to assess the land-use impact on soil hydrological properties, \n\na network of 31 sites was established focussing on six distinct landscape (land-\n\nuse/lithology) units. The number of selected sites per landscape unit was a function of \n\ntheir representativeness within the catchment: 11 sites in woodland, 9 being on sandstone  \n\nand 2 on limestone; 2) 11 sites in agricultural fields, including 5 on sandstone and 6 on \n\nlimestone; and 3) 9 sites on unpaved urban soils, comprising 4 on sandstone and 5 on \n\nlimestone. Over a one-year period, nine monitoring campaigns were carried out. These \n\nassessed the variability of surface soil matrix infiltration capacity, surface soil moisture \n\ncontent (0-50 mm) and hydrophobicity at different depths (0 mm, 20 mm and 50 mm) \n\nwithin the distinct landscape units. Spatial patterns of non-transient soil properties were \n\nalso analysed at each site: bulk density, organic matter content, particle size and rock \n\nfragment content.   \n\nAt the Plot scale, spatio-temporal variability of overland flow processes was explored \n\nthrough the installation and monitoring of runoff plots (8m\u00d72m). However, the absence \n\nof landowners\u2019 authorization to install plots in agricultural and urban soils, restricted the \n\nstudy to woodland areas. Considering the representativeness of woodland areas within \n\nRibeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment, the study investigated the rainfall-runoff relationship in \n\nthe three most representative woodland types: 1) dense eucalypt plantations; 2) sparse \n\neucalypt stands; and 3) a relic of semi-natural oak woodland. Three replicated plots per \n\nwoodland type were considered. Overland flow depth was measured at 1- to 2-weekly \n\nintervals, depending on rainfall events, during two hydrological years. To better \n\nunderstand spatio-temporal differences of overland flow, additional measurements of \n\nthroughfall (manual gauges), soil moisture (0-100 mm) and hydrophobicity (0 mm, 20 \n\nmm and 50 mm depth) were performed at the same time as overland flow measurements.  \n\nThe land-use impact on streamflow was assessed at the sub-catchment and catchment \n\nscales. Data at the catchment scale was derived from a continuos flow gauging station \n\nthat had been established in 2008 at the catchment outlet. In order to assess the impact of \n\ndifferent landscape patterns, characterized by different land-uses and urbanization styles, \n\nthe hydrological and meteorological network was extended by eight additional raingauges \n\nand eight water-level recorders to provide continuous data records at the sub-catchment \n\nlevel. Discharge differences were evaluated through 1) annual and monthly flows, by \n\nrunoff coefficient and baseflow index examination, and 2) analysis of individual rainfall \n\nevents, in terms of flow depth, runoff coefficient, surface runoff coefficient, peak flow, \n\nresponse and recession time. A detailed characterization of the land-uses and the urban \n\nareas within each sub-catchment was performed, in order to enable the impact of flow \n\nconnectivity to be explored. This strategy also enabled the roles of climatic variability on \n\nstreamflow of different lithological units (sandstone vs limestone) to be explored. \n\nThe impact of land-use pattern on water quality was also assessed through several water \n\nsamples collected in four sites of the stream network. Samples were taken at the \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n11 \n\ncatchment outlet and in three sub-catchments with distinct land-uses (urban areas ranging \n\nbetween 9-25% and 50%) at different times during eight rainfall events of differing \n\nmagnitude and antecedent weather.  \n\nThe integrated approach of this methodology was considered to provide a better \n\nunderstanding of the spatio-temporal variation of overland flow sources and sinks over \n\nthe landscape and the influence on streamflow. This knowledge was used in the thesis to \n\nprovide guidelines for urban planning and catchment management, in order to minimize \n\nflood hazards and maintain a good water quality status, through flow connectivity breaks \n\nbetween the potential sources and the stream network. \n\n \n\n1.4. Thesis structure \n\nSubsequent to this introductory chapter (Chapter 1), this manuscript is divided into six \n\nadditional chapters. Chapter 2 was based on literature review and presents the state of the \n\nart regarding land-use impacts driven by urbanization on hydrology and surface water \n\nquality. Chapters 3-5 present and analyse the results of the programme aimed at \n\nquantification of surface hydrological processes in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es. \n\nChapter 3 is focused on the spatio-temporal variability of soil hydrological properties. \n\nDifferences in soil moisture, hydrophobicity and soil matrix infiltration capacity were \n\nmeasured over one year, in different land-uses (woodland, agricultural and urban) \n\noverlaying sandstone and limestone lithologies. These results are analysed in terms of \n\npotential overland flow sources and sinks within the catchment, and how they may change \n\nover the year, as a result of contrasting seasonal patterns associated with Mediterranean \n\nclimate.  \n\nChapter 4 is dedicated to the field experiments carried out in woodland areas of Ribeira \n\ndos Cov\u00f5es over two years, analysing overland flow differences between dense eucalypt \n\nplantations, sparse eucalypt stands and oak woodland. Temporal variation of overland \n\nflow processes between dry and wet seasons are discussed based on soil moisture and \n\nhydrophobicity variation. The potential impact of different woodland patches as sources \n\nand sinks of overland flow in peri-urban catchments is also addressed.  \n\nThe influence of land-use pattern on streamflow (sub-catchment and catchment scale) are \n\ninvestigated in Chapter 5. The influence of urban areas, characterized by distinct extent \n\ncover, proportion of soil sealing, distance to the stream network and dissimilar water \n\nmanagement strategies, on stream discharge (e.g. runoff coefficients, flow depth, peak \n\nflow, response and recession times) are analysed and discussed. The influence of climate \n\nvariability and lithology on catchment hydrological response is also analysed. Spatio-\n\ntemporal differences in the flow regime are discussed in terms of flow connectivity. \n\n\n\n CHAPTER 1 \u2013 INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n \n\n12 \n\nCurrent problems of water drainage systems within the catchment are stressed, and the \n\nimplications of the forecasted urbanization trend on flood hazard are pondered.   \n\nChapter 6 focuses on the impact of rainfall pattern on water quality. Physical-chemical \n\nproperties of distinct drainage areas within the peri-urban catchment are presented. The \n\nimpact of different rainfall events on physical-chemical properties of surface water are \n\nassessed in relation to Portuguese standards for minimum environmental water quality. \n\nThe results are analysed and discussed in terms of differences in the urbanization type.   \n\nThe chapters focusing on field data analysis (Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6) are structured in the \n\nformat of individual scientific publications. Thus they each comprise a small introduction \n\nto the covered content, a study site description focusing the most relevant aspects \n\nregarding to that chapter, the methodology used to achieve the specific objectives, the \n\nassociated results as well as their analyses and discussion, and the key conclusions. \n\nBecause of this structure, the introductory sections involve partial repetition, although \n\nfocussing on specific topics. \n\nChapter 7 summarises the main findings of the thesis. It then provides some suggestions \n\nto improve stormwater management in the study site, as well as guidelines to improve \n\ngeneral land management and urban planning at the catchment scale, in order to minimize \n\nflood hazard and preserve surface water quality. The challenges and limitations of the \n\nresearch are also discussed. \n\nA consolidated list of references for the entire thesis is provided. Thus, to avoid repetition, \n\nindividual lists for Chapters 3-6 were not presented, despite their scientific paper structure \n\nin all the other aspects.  \n\n \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2  \n\nURBAN AND PERI-URBAN LAND-USE CHANGE \n\nIMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND \n\nSURFACE WATER QUALITY: A REVIEW  \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\n2.2 Hydrological consequences of land-use change focusing on urbanization/peri-\n\nurbanization \n\n2.2.1 Methodologies to assess hydrological impacts at the catchment scale \n\n2.2.2 Urbanization impacts on catchment hydrology \n\n2.2.3 Overland flow processes and flow connectivity over the landscape \n\n2.2.4 Influence of spatial land-use pattern \n\n2.2.5 Impacts of water management activities \n\n2.3 Surface water quality \n\n2.3.1 Sources of pollutants within peri-urban areas \n\n2.3.2 Contributions from different impervious surfaces \n\n2.3.3 Land-use contributions for water quality \n\n2.3.4 Influence of landscape connectivity \n\n2.3.5 Temporal variation of pollutant sources \n\n2.4 Final considerations \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \u2013 URBAN AND PERI-URBAN LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON \n\nHYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND SURFACE WATER QUALITY: A REVIEW  \n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.  \n2.  \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n15 \n\n2.1. Introduction \n\nPopulation growth has been driven a global urbanization trend, associated with great \n\nenvironmental pressure, particularly as a result of land-use changes. The conversion of \n\nnatural landscapes into agricultural fields and impervious surfaces can substantially affect \n\nhydrological processes at several scales and the equilibrium of aquatic ecosystems. The \n\nincreasing tendency for urban sprawl from the urban cores, associated with a low-density \n\ndevelopment, is a major factor in the acceleration of the extent to which impervious \n\nsurfaces come to dominate the landscape (Zhang and Shuster et al., 2014).  \n\nOver the last 50 years, land-use change impacts on water cycle have been widely \n\nmonitored and documented, but the studies focusing the impact on water quality are more \n\nrecent. Human activities and different land surface covers affect water yields, interception \n\nlosses, evapotranspiration rates, flood peaks, sediment transport rates, and concentrations \n\nand loads of many water quality constituents.  \n\nNevertheless, these consequences are not only affected by the spatial extent of land-use \n\nchanges, but tend to be also site-specific, particularly due to the influence of climate on \n\ntemporal variation of the hydrological processes (e.g. Cerd\u00e0, 1997; Cammeraat, 2002; \n\nEaston et al., 2007). Field observations and measurements are undoubtedly the base to \n\nunderstand human effects on the hydrological cycle and water quality issues. Recent \n\nimprovements in data collection, data archiving, data distribution and computational \n\ncapabilities to support such analyses represent important parameters to enhance \n\nknowledge about land-use impacts. However, it has proven to be quite challenging to \n\ndraw conclusions from studies due to relatively short time series and great local spatial \n\nvariation in parameters, such as geology, lithology and soil depth (Calvo-Cases et al., \n\n2003; G\u00fcntner and Bronstert, 2004; Komatsu et al., 2011; Lorz et al., 2007; Hardie et al., \n\n2012).     \n\nThe consequences of land-use changes are of interest not only for the academic \n\ncommunity, particularly hydrologists and ecologists, but are also of critical importance \n\nfor land management and urban planners. The proper planning of landscape pattern and \n\nrunoff management, associated with flood control measurements, as well as protective \n\nactions to ensure water quality standards and thus, public health and environmental \n\nprotection, are critically dependent on the understanding of human impacts at the \n\ncatchment scale. There is a clear trend towards approaches that attempt to restore pre-\n\ndevelopment flow-regimes and water quality simultaneously. There has been an \n\nincreasing recognition that restoring a more natural water balance benefits not only the \n\nenvironment, but enhances the \u201cliveability\u201d of the urban landscape (Fletcher et al., 2013).    \n\nThe main goal of this chapter is to present a synthesis of a wide-ranging literature on the \n\neffects of land-use change, particularly associated with urbanization on (1) hydrological \n\nprocesses and (2) surface water quality.   \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \u2013 URBAN AND PERI-URBAN LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON \n\nHYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND SURFACE WATER QUALITY: A REVIEW  \n\n \n\n16 \n\n2.2. Hydrological consequences of land-use change focusing \n\non urbanization/peri-urbanization  \n\n2.2.1. Methodologies to assess hydrological impacts at the catchment \n\nscale \n\nThe methods used by researchers to assess impacts of land-use change on the hydrological \n\nresponse of catchments, may be grouped into: 1) paired catchment monitoring, 2) time \n\nseries analysis, and 3) hydrological modelling. The first approach is based on the \n\ncomparison of adjacent catchments with different degrees of urban development and \n\nunder similar climate settings, as well as similar geological characteristics. However, this \n\nmethodology has been mostly applied in small catchments, given the difficulty to find \n\ntwo similar catchments with medium or large sizes. The use of one catchment has been \n\nalso considered if it contains areas with different land-uses, but spatial differences in \n\nphysical characteristics of the catchments are limiting to the conclusions. Increasingly, a \n\n\u201cdouble comparison\u201d approach has been adopted by including a \u201ccontrol\u201d catchment in \n\nwhich there has been no land-use change in the study period, but which has had the same \n\nland-use history as the ones undergoing change. \n\nThe data exploration approach is based on statistic time-series analysis of hydrological \n\ndata from areas undergone urbanization. Different studies focused on few years of \n\nstreamflow data (e.g. Huang et al., 2008; Wijesekara et al., 2012), whereas other studies \n\nare based on a few decades of records (e.g. Mungai et al., 2004; Leopold et al., 2005). \n\nSeveral parameters have been considered by different authors to assess the impact of \n\nurbanization on streamflow regimes, including statistical tests and characterisation of \n\nhigh and low flows. Braud et al. (2013) reviewed the methods applied for streamflow \n\nanalysis, and extracted five classes of indicators used to examine the impact of land-\n\nuse/land cover change on discharge time series. These are 1) parameters related to \n\nhydrological regime, such as annual runoff, seasonal components, discharge quantiles and \n\nflow duration curves; 2) high flows characterization, focussing on annual maximum \n\ndischarge and peak flows; 3) low flow indicators, such as minimum annual discharge, \n\nfrequency of zero discharge, baseflow index (defined as the ratio between annual \n\nbaseflow and total annual flow); 4) hydrograph analysis, including the study of event \n\ncharacteristics (runoff coefficient, rising and falling limbs of hydrographs) and the \n\nquantification of flow components into baseflow, interflow and quick flow; and 5) \n\nindicators based on statistical analysis of long time series, in order to compare differences \n\nbetween various periods as well as trend analysis.  \n\nSince controlled field-scale experiments are difficult to perform because of land-use and \n\nclimate changes, numerical models have been widely implemented to predict the \n\nhydrological consequences of these alterations and to anticipate the impact of future \n\nglobal changes (e.g. DeFries and Eshleman, 2004; Delgado et al., 2010). These methods \n\nmostly rely on either simple or lumped, distributed or conceptual hydrological modelling \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n17 \n\n(Wijesekara et al., 2012). However, models are subjected to uncertainties in their \n\nstructure, inputs, and parameter estimation so that the measure of their reliability is always \n\nquestionable (Zhang and Shuster, 2014). For example, Bhaduri et al. (2001) compared \n\nmodelling results from the L-THIA (Long-Term Hydrologic Impact Assessment) model \n\nwith the SWMM (Stormwater Management Model) in two small catchments in Chicago. \n\nResults indicated that L-THIA predicts annual average runoff between 1.1 and 23.7% \n\nhigher than SWMM.  \n\nDifferences between modelling results reinforce the need for field data in order to \n\nimprove model efficiency. In addition, the choice of model is always limited by available \n\ndata, computing capabilities and thorough knowledge of the catchment hydrology (Chu \n\net al., 2013). A review of different hydrological models used to assess the impacts of land-\n\nuse changes was performed by DeFries and Eshleman (2004). Recently, the Peri-Urban \n\nModel for landscape Management (PUMMA) was specifically designed to study the \n\nhydrology of peri-urban catchments. This model combines rural and urban hydrological \n\nmodels, and is used for process understanding (Jankowfsky et al., 2012). \n\n \n\n2.2.2. Urbanization impacts on catchment hydrology  \n\nThe process of urbanization leads to changes on the water cycle. As an area becomes \n\ndominated by impervious surfaces, decreasing evapotranspiration and soil infiltration \n\ncapacity lead to increasing surface runoff and enhanced hydraulic efficiency over the \n\nlandscape, promoting a decreasing groundwater recharge. Nevertheless, the magnitude of \n\nsuch impacts varied greatly among study sites. Some examples are given below.  \n\nBased on modelling results, increasing urban surface from 20 to 100% in U.S.A \n\ncatchments leads to a 50% increase in total runoff and a 50% reduction in actual \n\nevapotranspiration and percolation to groundwater (Albrecht, 1974). In contrast, in \n\nCanada, a 65% increase of built-up areas in southern Alberta, was calculated to provide \n\ndecreases of only 1% and 2.3% in total evapotranspiration and water infiltration, \n\nrespectively. These changes led to a 7.3% increase in stream runoff, but also to a 13.2% \n\ndecrease in baseflow, resulting in a total flow decrease of 4% (Wijesekara et al., 2012).  \n\nIn the Southern River catchment, Western Australia, 20% urbanization of a natural area \n\nfomented a significant reduction in evaporative losses from the soil profile, and a decrease \n\nfrom nearly 80% to less than 20% in infiltration, causing a decrease on water table after \n\nurbanization. In addition, increases in total annual discharge were associated with a \n\npredicted runoff coefficient rise from 1% to more than 40%. However, increased \n\nstreamflow was mainly due to higher groundwater recharge and subsequent catchment \n\nbaseflow, as a result of the roof and road runoff infiltration and establishment of \n\nsubsurface drainage adopted in local construction practices (Barron et al., 2012). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \u2013 URBAN AND PERI-URBAN LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON \n\nHYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND SURFACE WATER QUALITY: A REVIEW  \n\n \n\n18 \n\nOther studies also reported greater impacts of imperviousness on surface flow than on \n\ntotal streamflow (Choi et al., 2003; Li and Wang, 2009). A comparison between \n\nstreamflow of a mixed land-use catchment and an urban catchment in the Portland \n\nMetropolitan Area of Oregon, USA, reported significant increases in runoff during storm \n\nevents rather than increases in mean annual runoff (Chang, 2007). In Dardenne Creek \n\ncatchment, Missouri, the urban area increase from 3.4% to 27.3% was accomplished by \n\na modelling forecast of >70% increase in average direct runoff (Li and Wang, 2009). \n\nIn Leipzig, Germany, modelling analysis of available data demonstrated increased storm \n\nflow with the extent of impervious land, but storm flow increased less severely where the \n\nsoil had a poor infiltration capacity before it was surfaced, depending on soil texture. Only \n\nwhen the impervious area reached 20% of the surface, did storm flow values start to \n\ndouble, since before that impervious threshold there were still sufficient un-built surfaces \n\nin which the precipitation could percolate and infiltrate. When the surface was largely \n\nunsurfaced, annual storm flow was of the order of 25-150 mm, but reached 200 mm when \n\nimperviousness amounted to 40\u201360%, and attained more than 300 mm when \n\nimperviousness exceeded 80% of the area (Haase, 2009). \n\nBased on Gwynns Falls catchment near Baltimore, Brun and Band (2000) found a \n\nthreshold of 20-25% impervious cover was necessary to identify changes in runoff \n\ncoefficient. Also Hawley and Bledsoe (2011) found from the analysis of 43 gauging \n\nstations installed on urban streams within semi-arid southern California, that with more \n\nthan 20% imperviousness, streamflow experienced five times as many days of mean daily \n\nflows higher than 3 m3 s-1 and approximately three times as many days of the order of 30 \n\nm3 s-1 relative to the undeveloped setting.  \n\nIn Accotink Creek, Virginia, Jennings and Jarnagin (2002) identified statistically \n\nsignificant increases in mean daily streamflow response when impervious cover increased \n\nfrom 13% to 21%, associated with mean and extreme daily precipitation levels. Analysis \n\nof historical mean daily streamflow also revealed a decrease in the precipitation amount \n\nrequired to produce a given level of streamflow. However, Burns et al. (2005) reported a \n\n300% increase in mean peak discharges for a catchment with only 11% impervious \n\nsurface compared with a similarly sized catchment with no impervious surface.  \n\nIncreasing frequency of high flow events resultant from urbanization was also reported \n\nin other studies, accompanied by a decreasing frequency of low-flow events. In the Big \n\nRiver catchment, in east-central Missouri, a three fold increase in urban area in 15 years \n\nresulted in a 140% increase of high flow events, as well as a decrease in frequency of low \n\nflow events by up to 100% (Chu et al., 2013). \n\nIn Atlanta Metropolitan Area, Georgia, USA, a comparative study of streamflow \n\ncharacteristics of non-urbanized, less-urbanized and highly urbanized catchments, \n\nexhibited 30\u2013100% greater peak flows in the latter. In the highly urbanized catchment, \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n19 \n\nshorter storm recession period (1\u20132 days less than in the other catchments) and baseflow \n\nrecession constants (35-40% decrease), were attributed to the more efficient routing of \n\nstormwater and the paving of groundwater recharge areas (Rose and Peters, 2001).  \n\nIn the Tanshui catchment, Taiwan, urban development from 4.8% to 12.5% led to \n\nshortened times to peak flow from 9 to 6h, and the recurrence intervals of 200, 100, 50, \n\nand 25 years before urbanization were reduced to about 88, 33, 16, and 8 years (Huang et \n\nal., 2008). However, in the Mid-Atlantic Region, Jarnagin (2007) reported a 20% \n\ndevelopment has a 'hard limit' (with 10% imperviousness) without significant changes in \n\nstream hydrology, particularly on stream flashiness.  \n\nRogers and DeFee (2005) suggested that when urban development exceeds 25% of the \n\ncatchment area, the potential for floods and droughts increases exponentially. Increased \n\nflood frequency was also demonstrated in the streamflow records of six urbanized basins \n\nin Puget Lowlands, Washington, subject to distinct degrees of urbanization (Moscrip and \n\nMontgomery, 1997). Generally, events of 10-year recurrence interval in pre-urbanization \n\nstage, were shortened to 1 to 4-year recurrence interval events in post-urbanization \n\nrecords.  \n\nSome authors also suggest that urbanization mainly affects the flow peaks of smaller \n\nevents with higher frequency, and have only a minor impact on larger storm events. In \n\nthe Apennines of Itally, a 5% urbanization of a meadow and pasture region over a 20 \n\nyears period, showed a greater incidence of lower return period discharges, but only small \n\nincrease in peak flows of 10 and 200 years return periods.  \n\nIn Xitiaoxi catchment, China, modelling results revealed that for an urban area increase \n\nfrom 9% to 17% of the catchment, the expected peak flow increase was 3.9%, 2.7% and \n\n2.3% associated with recurrence intervals of 10, 50 and 100 years. For the same \n\nrecurrence intervals and for a scenario of urban area increase from 9% to 14%, the peak \n\nflow increases were 3.3%, 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively (Ying et al., 2009). In Qinhuai \n\nRiver catchment in Jiangsu Province, China, an increase in impervious surface from 2.3% \n\nto 13.9% led to daily peak discharge rise from 2.3% to 13.9%, but also indicated greater \n\nimpacts associated with smaller than larger rainfall events (Du et al., 2012). \n\nThe long-term observation of urban growth and sprawling land consumption has proven \n\nthat it is the cumulative impact of land-use change and surface sealing, rather than short-\n\nterm consequences of construction that is likely to impair the urban water balance. \n\nHowever, research along 47 southeastern Wisconsin streams found that baseflow \n\ndeclined significantly when catchment imperviousness exceeded a threshold range of 8 \n\nto 12% (Wang et al., 2011). In Philadelphia catchments, baseflow declined steadily until \n\ncatchment imperviousness reached 40% to 50% (Hammer, 1972). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \u2013 URBAN AND PERI-URBAN LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON \n\nHYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND SURFACE WATER QUALITY: A REVIEW  \n\n \n\n20 \n\nDetailed reviews of the urban impacts on catchments hydrology are given by Shuster et \n\nal. (2005), Jacobson (2011) and Fletcher et al. (2013), but a synthesis of streamflow \n\nvariation resultant from urbanization is shown on Figure 2.1. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 - Schematic illustration of the urbanization impacts on hydrograph shape (adapted \n\nfrom Fletcher et al., 2013). \n\n \n\n2.2.3. Overland flow processes and flow connectivity over the \n\nlandscape \n\nDespite a large degree of consencus between hydrological studies focusing on \n\nurbanization impacts on the water cycle, particularly on streamflow changes, magnitudes \n\nof impact vary and differ concerning the existence of an urban cover threshold. These \n\nvariations may be a consequence of differences in (1) the spatio-temporal pattern of runoff \n\nprocesses generated within the catchments, and (2) the flow connectivity between sources \n\nand the stream network.  \n\nIn urban and peri-urban catchments, overland flow can occur on both pervious and \n\nimpervious surfaces. Pervious surfaces can generate infiltration-excess overland flow \n\n(Hortonian flow) when precipitation intensity exceeds the soil infiltration capacity \n\n(Horton, 1933). It depends on soil properties, such as unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, \n\nwhich may be an important predictor of runoff timing and volume (Shuster et al., 2005). \n\nUrban soils are usually associated with lower infiltration capacity, due to physical \n\ndegradation through compaction, linked to increased soil bulk density and decreased \n\nporosity (Dornauf and Burghardt, 2000; Yang and Zhang, 2011). Infiltration-excess \n\nmechanism is very important not only in pervious urban surfaces, but also in bare soils \n\nand cultivated areas, where significant soil crusting and/or surface sealing occurs during \n\nrain events (Steenhuis et al., 2005).  \n\nLower baseflow\nLarger baseflow\n\nSmall storm response\n\nQuicker\n\nresponse \n\ntime\n\nSteeper\n\nfalling\n\nlimb\n\nHigher peak, \n\nlarger volume Pre-development\n\nPost-development\n\nTime\n\nD\nis\n\nc\nh\n\na\nr\ng\n\ne\n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n21 \n\nDuring wet periods, overland flow can be also generated in saturated areas of permeable \n\nsoils. It is driven by rainfall amount and antecedent weather conditions (Dixon and Earls, \n\n2012) and is dependent on landscape factors such as shallow soil depth (affects available \n\nwater storage capacity), slope concavities and hollows (Walter et al., 2000; Steenhuis et \n\nal., 2005). This saturation mechanism is mainly important in humid and well vegetated \n\nregions (e.g. Dunne and Black, 1970). \n\nImpervious surfaces, such as roads and roofs, are prone to generate overland flow, given \n\ntheir small storage capacity and smooth surface (Albrecht, 1974). Road surfaces in UK \n\ncities were found to infiltrate only 6 to 9% of the rainfall, depending on the nature of the \n\nsurface, subsurface layers, level of traffic, etc. (Rabag et al., 2003). However, if overland \n\nflow from impervious surfaces flows onto pervious surfaces, it may infiltrate before \n\nreaching the catchment drainage network (Boyd et al., 1993). Thus, streamflow response \n\nwill depend on the extent and distribution of impervious and pervious surfaces, as well as \n\nthe connectivity between land surface and the drainage network, driven by the spatial \n\nform and location of different land-uses (Hawley and Bledsoe, 2011; Jacobson, 2011; \n\nMej\u00eda and Moglen, 2009; Parikh et al., 2005).  \n\nSlopes can therefore behave as a mosaic of runoff and run-on areas, providing non-\n\nuniform infiltration. On each surface, interception and depression storage must be \n\nsatisfied before overland flow commences. Initial losses are known to be small on \n\nimpervious surfaces (Melanen and Laukkanen, 1981; Pratt et al., 1984; Jensen, 1990), but \n\nlarger on pervious areas (Boyd et al., 1993). As a consequence, overland flow from \n\npervious sites is more difficult to predict than runoff from impervious surfaces, because \n\nit depends on land-use, soil properties, geology, surface topography, as well as antecedent \n\nwetness. These factors influence the landscape structure and spatial organisation of a \n\ncatchment which, in turn, determine the distribution of water flow paths, the patterns of \n\nwater storage and residence time distributions (Soulsby et al., 2006).   \n\nWhen rainfall intensity exceeds infiltration capacity and/or the soil become saturated, the \n\nexcess water remains on the surface and partly fills depressions. If rain persists, \n\ndepressions become filled and overland flow occurs, connecting adjacent depressions. \n\nWith additional rainwater, more and more depressions become connected and a network \n\nof flow paths is eventually formed and may reach the outflow boundary (Darboux et al., \n\n2001). If rainfall has occurred prior to an event, soil moisture stores will be part full and \n\nthe water retention capacity is lower (Boyd et al., 1993).  \n\nA simulation study performed by Liu et al. (2006) demonstrated than in Steinsel \n\ncatchment, Luxembourg, the overland flow coefficient and runoff partitioning from \n\ndifferent land-use areas vary from one storm event to another due to the differences in \n\nsoil moisture and storm characteristics. Increasing overland flow with greater soil \n\nmoisture was also reported in a small catchment located in a suburban area near Nantes, \n\nFrance, where base flow represented on average 14% of the total per-event streamflow, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \u2013 URBAN AND PERI-URBAN LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON \n\nHYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND SURFACE WATER QUALITY: A REVIEW  \n\n \n\n22 \n\nbut increased to average 36% during rainfall events (Berthier et al., 2004). These studies \n\nalso show that the pervious part of a catchment may contain source areas which generate \n\nmost of the runoff, with little runoff coming from the remaining pervious areas.  \n\nThe presence of vegetation and litter increases soil roughness (soil irregularities and \n\ncavities) and therefore depression storage capacity (hydraulic resistance), which may \n\nprovide local water storage capacity and aid infiltration, by providing runoff obstructions \n\nand delaying or eliminating overland flow transfer downslope (Darboux et al., 2001; \n\nCalvo-Cases et al., 2003; Bracken and Croke, 2007; Borselli et al., 2008; Rodr\u00edguez-\n\nCaballero et al., 2012). The capacity of the vegetation to reduce runoff volume and \n\nvelocity depends on: (a) the plant cover/biomass (Kirkby et al., 2002) and its \n\ncharacteristics (width and slope of the vegetation strip, vegetation height, density, \n\nstiffness and species composition); (b) the inflow (runoff velocity, discharge, and \n\nvolume); and (c) the antecedent weather conditions (L\u00f3pez-Vicente et al., 2013). \n\nVegetation creates a mixture of run-off and run-on sites determined by soil wetness \n\n(Castillo et al., 2003), reason why it has been considered by many authors as a key factor \n\ninterrupting hydrological connectivity (e.g. Bracken and Croke, 2007).  \n\nIn urbanized areas, vegetation is cleared and the soil surface is often graded, depressions \n\nare filled and impervious surfaces are extended. This leads to decreased depression \n\nstorage capacity and a concomitant decline in natural sinks for water infiltration. As a \n\nconsequence, larger volume of water is available for overland flow, reaching higher \n\nvelocities due to water resistance reduction at the surface. In addition, overland flow \n\namount and velocity is also a function of the slope, since gentle slopes favour infiltration \n\nbut also lead to easier saturation due to the influence of throughflow, whereas steep slopes \n\nlead to larger amounts of overland flow (Bronstert et al., 2002).  \n\n \n\n2.2.4. Influence of spatial land-use pattern  \n\nConsidering the relevance of the extent and location of pervious and impervious surfaces \n\nto overland flow and runoff generation, the understanding and quantification of the \n\nhydrological impacts of urbanization require a detailed characterization of different land \n\ncovers (Shuster et al., 2005; Mouri et al., 2011; Berezowski et al., 2012). Several methods \n\nhave been used to analyse the spatial arrangement of land-uses and imperviousness within \n\ncatchments, as can be found in the reviews by Jacobson (2011) and Weng (2012).  \n\nThe distance between overland flow sources (pervious soils and/or impervious surfaces) \n\nand the drainage network (main channel or tributaries) represents an important parameter \n\ninfluencing streamflow response (e.g. Wang et al., 2000). Source areas located close to \n\nthe drainage network can be significant contributors to runoff, while those located further \n\naway may provide no or only a minor impact on streamflow, due to the greater \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n23 \n\nopportunities for surface flow retention and infiltration over the hillslope. Through the \n\nmodelling of two small catchments (<1 ha), Zhang and Shuster (2014) demonstrated less \n\nhydrological connectivity between impervious elements and the outlet when pervious \n\nelements are located downslope. \n\nThe lack of flow connectivity between runoff sources and the stream network has been \n\nused to explain unexpected patterns between total impervious area (TIA) and streamflow \n\nparameters (Hawley and Bledsoe, 2011; Jacobson, 2011). In order to overcome these \n\nproblems, some authors have been considering the Effective Impervious Area (EIA) \n\nparameter, which represents the impervious areas directly connected to the stream \n\nnetwork (Roy and Shuster, 2009; Jacobson, 2011; Yang and Zhang, 2011).  \n\nA laboratory study by Pappas et al. (2008) showed higher stream runoff generation when \n\nimpervious surfaces were located downslope comparing with similar upslope \n\nimperviousness. Overland flow from directly connected impervious surfaces will reach \n\nthe slope outlet more rapidly than where impervious surfaces run-off onto areas having \n\nsignificant capacity for abstraction or storage. In contrast, if the runoff from upslope \n\nimpervious surfaces are not directly connected with the outlet, it will only contribute for \n\nstreamflow if downslope soil infiltration capacity or water storage capacity are exceeded \n\nby rainfall and generate run-on. Through rainfall events, as the downslope soil infiltration \n\ncapacity and/or storage capacities decline, soil surface generates overland flow and can \n\nbecome similar to an impervious surface.  \n\nIn the lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia, Canada, discharge data from streams \n\ndraining areas with similar percentage urbanization increase but distinct types of urban \n\ndevelopment, displayed greater runoff coming from areas with large housing \n\ndevelopments and extensive parking lots, than areas with small housing developments \n\ndistributed throughout the catchment (Leith and Whitfield, 2000).  \n\nThe mixed land-use character of peri-urban catchments can therefore provide increasing \n\nretention capacity of the overland flow, showing a lower hydrologic impact than classical \n\nurban catchments (Jankowfsky et al., 2012). However, seasonal variation of runoff \n\nsources can result from changes in pervious area contribution during wettest periods. In \n\nChaudanne catchment, which is located in the peri-urban area of Lyon, France, under a \n\ntemperate climate with Continental and Mediterranean influence, uncalibrated model \n\nresults showed the importance of overland flow from impervious areas in summer events \n\nand flow contributions from rural zones during winter events (Jankowfsky et al., 2012).  \n\nBased on the analysis of the streamflow records from 26 urban basins located in 12 \n\ncountries, Boyd et al. (1993) showed that small amounts of pervious runoff occurred for \n\nmost storms, but increased for larger storms. These led to a greater scatter of data in \n\ncatchments with pervious overland flow than those dominated by impervious overland \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \u2013 URBAN AND PERI-URBAN LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON \n\nHYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND SURFACE WATER QUALITY: A REVIEW  \n\n \n\n24 \n\nflow. These authors also reported that larger basins tend to generate both pervious and \n\nimpervious runoff.  \n\nVariable runoff contributions from pervious areas can be enhanced by the subsurface \n\nwater connectivity. During a wet period, Burns et al. (2005) observed greater flows from \n\nan undeveloped catchment in Croton River basin, New York, USA, than an alike \n\nresidential one (similar size, geomorphology and physiographic characteristics) as a result \n\nof greater subsurface storage and/or hydraulic conductivity of the soil at depth, leading to \n\ngreater baseflow contribution. On the other hand, with increasing impervious cover and \n\na concomitant decrease in subsurface runoff, the importance of antecedent soil water \n\ncontent to overland flow formation is restricted (Shuster et al., 2005). \n\nWithin urban areas, the road network has been considered an important source of overland \n\nflow and a main cause of decreased water concentration time. Eisenbies et al. (2007) \n\nestimated that road networks could increase the effective drainage density by 40-100%. \n\nRoad cuts may also intercept subsurface water by breaking the natural movement of \n\npipeflow, or by creating artificial areas of water resurgence through disruption of \n\nsubsurface flow networks. In recent years, best management practices consider the \n\nlocation and form of road networks in order to redirect overland flow at topographic \n\nbreaks and other permeable sites, thus minimizing connectivity with streams (Eisenbies \n\net al., 2007; H\u00fcmann et al., 2011).  \n\n \n\n2.2.5. Impacts of water management activities  \n\nBesides the spatial distribution of pervious and impervious surfaces within a catchment, \n\nflow connectivity is also affected by water management activities (Reed et al. 2006; \n\nDeFries and Eshleman 2004). Problems of urban runoff are usually managed with \n\nengineered solutions linked to the channelization of water. In urban/peri-urban areas there \n\nare three basic types of drainage systems: 1) sanitary sewerage for domestic and industrial \n\nwastewater, 2) storm drains intended to rapidly and safely convey storm runoff, and 3) \n\ncombined sewerage, which drains wastewater and storm runoff in one system.  \n\nThe introduction of artificial drainage increases the direct input of precipitation into \n\nstream channels, by circumventing depression storage and groundwater recharge (Foster \n\net al., 1999). In the urban area of Nassau County, total streamflow declined when local \n\nwater users began to send wastewater to a regional sewer system and abandoned the use \n\nof on-site septic systems (Sulam, 1979). Konrad and Booth (2002) also attributed the flow \n\ndecrease in Issaquah Creek to the combination of wastewater collection and ground-water \n\npumping. Simmons and Reynolds (1982) reported decreases of 20% to 85% of \n\ngroundwater flow in sewered urbanized catchments.  \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n25 \n\nStorm runoff channelization leads to a faster rise and recession of streamflow, higher peak \n\nrates and increased storm flow volume from a given amount of precipitation (Konrad and \n\nBooth, 2005; Tetzlaff et al., 2005; Wheater and Evans, 2009). Streamflow records from \n\ntwo adjacent catchments in Swindon, United Kingdom, showed that the area served by a \n\nstorm drainage system was a stronger determinant of streamflow response than either \n\nimpervious area or development type (Miller et al., 2014). Here, the introduction of a \n\nlarge-scale storm drainage system in a 44% urban cover was accompanied by a 50% \n\nreduction in rainfall-runoff duration and a peak flow increase of over 400%. The study \n\nalso revealed a significant increase in flashiness of storm runoff, above that attributed to \n\nimpervious area alone. \n\nThe quicker runoff resulting from the storm drainage systems can, however, induce flood \n\nrisk in downstream areas, particularly in small catchments (Boyd et al., 1993; Navratil et \n\nal., 2013). Nevertheless, in a peri-urban area of Lion, France, Braud et al. (2013) reported \n\nan increase in frequency of smaller floods as a result of the sewer overland flow devices, \n\nbut a marginal impact on the largest floods, mainly governed by saturation of the rural \n\nparts of the catchments. \n\nThe maintenance of the artificial drainage systems can also influence the catchment \n\nhydrology. Generally, such drainage systems are not watertight and leakage from \n\ndrinking water, storm drainage and wastewater pipes can provide an important source of \n\ngroundwater recharge, thus sustaining baseflow during dry periods (Foster et al., 1999; \n\nScholz and Yazdi, 2009; Jankowfsky et al., 2012).  \n\nIncreases in baseflow have been also noted due to irrigation (Barron et al., 2012), car \n\nwashing (Meyer, 2005) and water imports from outside the catchment (Walsh et al., 2005; \n\nKonrad and Booth, 2002). In a high density residential catchment of New York, Burns et \n\nal. (2005) reported an increase of 0.25 mm day-1 in low streamflow due to groundwater \n\npumping for human consumption and irrigation. \n\nIn peri-urban areas, flow connectivity and streamflow response is often further \n\ncomplicated by the installation of reservoirs and stormwater retention systems. In a \n\nMediterranean catchment near St Tropez, France, the installation of a reservoir with a \n\nstorage capacity of 14% of the catchment area, decreased the runoff from the small \n\nupslope urban core (1.7% of the catchment area) by approximately 15% if the reservoir \n\nwas filling. Nevertheless, if the reservoir was full, no impact on streamflow was recorded \n\n(Fox et al., 2012). Detention tanks are used to store water during high intensity rainfall \n\nand gradually release it when the drainage network is not overloaded (Cembrano et al., \n\n2004). \n\nIn addition, surface runoff retention in specific infrastructures can favour infiltration and \n\ngroundwater recharge. Thus, in Long Island, New York, the use of recharge basins for \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \u2013 URBAN AND PERI-URBAN LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON \n\nHYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND SURFACE WATER QUALITY: A REVIEW  \n\n \n\n26 \n\ncollection and disposal of urban storm runoff led to a 12% increase in annual groundwater \n\nrecharge (Ku et al., 1992).  \n\nNevertheless, construction of dams and subsequent regulation of river flow regime can \n\neither increase or decrease low-flow discharge levels, depending on the operational \n\nmanagement of the reservoir. It is necessary to distinguish between small impoundments, \n\nsuch as farm dams, where there is little or no control over the level of storage, and larger \n\ndams where artificial releases can be made. Large artificial impoundments probably \n\nconstitute the single most important direct impact on the low flow regimes of rivers \n\n(Smakhtin, 2001).  \n\nThe complex interaction between all the above stated factors affecting flow connectivity \n\nover the landscape and the hydrological response of a catchment requires additional \n\nscientific information to understand better in which ways flow dynamics are changed by \n\nhuman impacts. Understanding the controls of runoff generation and transmission in \n\nrelation, for instance, to rainfall events, and how they differ according to temporal or \n\nspatial constraints, will give key information regarding flow pathways and hillslope \n\nconnectivity. Although some pathways might be dominant, they can change under \n\ndifferent circumstances (Lexartza-Artza and Wainwright, 2009).  \n\n \n\n2.3. Surface water quality \n\n2.3.1. Sources of pollutants within peri-urban areas \n\nConcern with water quality degradation within peri-urban and urban areas has raised \n\nawareness regarding sources of pollution. In mixed land-use catchments, there can be \n\nnumerous sources of contaminants, such as nutrients, organic compounds and heavy \n\nmetals. Sources can include untreated solid waste disposal, leachate from landfills, \n\nwastewater contamination (e.g. sewerage systems leakage, inefficient wastewater \n\ntreatment), industrial processes and spills, atmospheric deposition and stormwater runoff.   \n\nPercolation of rainwater through waste layers leads to various physical, chemical, and \n\nmicrobial processes that generate leachate which threaten water resources, particularly \n\ngroundwater. Landfill leachate plumes have been recognized as important sources of \n\ndissolved organic carbon, nitrogen, as well as ferrous iron, chloride and bicarbonate \n\n(Christensen et al., 2001; Corniello et al., 2007; Lorah et al., 2009). In a peri-urban \n\nfloodplain adjoining the city of Oxford, landfills contributed nearly 40% of the in-stream \n\nammonium (NH4). High concentrations of NH4 and low concentrations of nitrate (NO3) \n\nand dissolved oxygen in groundwater were also linked to landfill leachate in a peri-urban \n\nfloodplain adjoining the city of Oxford, UK (Gooddy et al., 2014). In a peri-urban area of \n\nUganda, solid waste dumping, together with animal rearing and grey water/stormwater \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n27 \n\ndisposal in unlined channels have been the main causes of groundwater contamination by \n\nnitrogen compounds (up to 370 mg Nk L-1 and 779 mg NO3 L\n-1), phosphorus (up to 13 \n\nmg L-1), thermotolerant coliforms and faecal streptococci (median values of 1263 cfu 100 \n\nmL-1 and 1543 cfu 100 mL-1, respectively) (Kulabako et al., 2007). \n\nIn peri-urban areas, sewage is generally either disposed and treated in septic systems, or \n\npiped into wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), together or separated from the \n\nstormwater flow. Septic fields have been recognized as significant sources of NO3, \n\nphosphate (PO4), chemical and biochemical oxygen demands (COD and BOD), as well \n\nas coliforms. In Rhode Island, for example, leachate from residential septic fields led to \n\nNO3 concentrations of 68 mg L\n-1 and mass losses of 47.5 kg ha-1 (Gold et al., 1990). \n\nGroundwater contamination derived from septic systems has been well documented \n\n(Robertson, 1995; Robertson and Harman, 1999; Wilhelm et al., 1994), but it eventually \n\ncontributes to surface water pollutant inputs (Gold et al., 1990; Wernick et al., 1998; \n\nCastro et al., 2003).  \n\nOn the other hand, centralized WWTPs ensure compliance with regulatory standards, but \n\nthe characteristics of the effluent released can vary considerably depending on the level \n\nof wastewater treatment. For example, Andersen et al. (2004) compared streamwater \n\nquality at multiple sites in South Carolina and reported higher average nitrate and soluble \n\nreactive phosphorus concentrations in streamwater downstream than upstream of \n\nWWTPs (NO3: 50.5 mg L\n-1 vs 1.6 mg L-1 and reactive phosphorus: 3.7 mg L-1 vs 0.3 mg \n\nL-1).  \n\nSurface water quality may be particularly affected by WWTP discharge during dry \n\nseasons, since it may represent a major fraction of downstream flows and dilution rates \n\nare reduced (Andersen et al., 2004; Ekka et al., 2006). The impact of WWTPs discharge \n\non surface water quality can therefore obscure the impact of the catchment land-use \n\n(Miltner et al., 2004). Furthermore, sewage and storm drainage system leaks during larger \n\nstorm events have also been considered a relevant source of pollution (Le Pape et al., \n\n2013).  \n\nThe efficiency of wastewater treatment is also dependent on the characteristics of the \n\ninput sewage. In combined drainage systems, sewage pollutants such as BOD, ammonia \n\n(NH3), total phosphorus (TP) and faecal coliform bacteria are diluted, but added to \n\nstormwater runoff pollutants like heavy metals (e.g. Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, Hg, and Zn). \n\nThese stormwater pollutants can have a negative impact on the performance of biologic \n\ntreatments in the WWTPs (Gromaire et al., 2001; Schoonover and Lockaby, 2006; \n\nSoonthornnonda and Christensen, 2007).  \n\nErosion is prone to occur in bare soils, construction sites and road edges due to rainfall \n\nand storm runoff, depending on soil properties and topographic characteristics (e.g. \n\nBurton and Pitt, 2001). Line et al. (2002) reported sediment exports during the clearing \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \u2013 URBAN AND PERI-URBAN LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON \n\nHYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND SURFACE WATER QUALITY: A REVIEW  \n\n \n\n28 \n\nand grading phase of a construction site nearly 10 times greater than in other land-uses, \n\nsuch as single-family residential areas, a golf course and dairy cow pasture. Line and \n\nWhite (2007) also reported sediment exports from a developing area about 95% greater \n\nthan forested and agricultural areas.  \n\nErosion has been considered a major factor perturbing the ecological status of the rivers, \n\ndue to greater suspended sediment concentrations and stream channels clogging. The \n\npresence of sediments in streamflow increases the turbidity and leads to reduced amount \n\nof light penetration, with detrimental impacts on photosynthesis, which affect dissolved \n\noxygen concentration and food availability to aquatic life (e.g. Atasoy et al, 2006).  \n\nFurthermore, fine sediments can also represent a threat for surface water quality due to \n\ntheir absorptive properties for several inorganic pollutants, such as phosphorus, heavy \n\nmetals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Goonetilleke et al., 2005; Le Pape \n\net al., 2013; Yu et al., 2014). Nitrogen inputs resulting from sediments released in a \n\nconstruction site in North Carolina (TN: 36.3 kg ha-1 yr-1; TP: 1.3 kg ha-1 yr-1) were similar \n\nto total N exports from residential (23.9 kg ha-1 yr-1) and golf course areas (31.2 kg ha-1 \n\nyr-1) (Line et al., 2002). \n\nAtmospheric chemistry can play an important role in influencing surface water quality, \n\nmainly via its influence on runoff process properties. Dry and/or wet deposition (through \n\nprecipitation) can contribute significant amounts of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) \n\nfrom 1) tree pollen, mostly from forestry but also lawns within residential areas (Hu, et \n\nal., 2001; Easton and Petrovic, 2004); 2) livestock emissions associated with agriculture \n\n(e.g. NH3) (Spokes and Jickells, 2005); 3) wind-eroded particles (Smil, 2000); and 4) \n\nfossil fuel combustion, released from vehicle traffic and industrial activities (Bernhardt \n\net al., 2008; Apeagyei et al., 2011).  \n\nNutrient contributions from vegetated areas in San Bernardino Mountains, California, \n\nwere investigated by Fenn and Poth (2004), who recorded nitrogen deposition rates of \n\n146 kg ha-1 yr-1 (NH4 + NO3) from ponderosa pine trees (Pinus ponderosa Laws).  \n\nIn Waquoit Bay, atmospheric deposition supplied 30% of estuary nitrogen loads, whereas \n\nfertilizer use and wastewater accounted for 15% and 48%, respectively. These \n\ncontributions were provided by fractions of the catchment, specifically from urban (39%), \n\nnatural vegetation (21%) and turfgrass areas (16%) (Valiela et al., 1997) \n\nTraffic emissions also provide an important nitrogen source to the atmosphere, ranging \n\nfrom 10 to 155 mg NH3 km\n-1 depending on vehicle type (Emmenegger et al., 2004). The \n\nrelationship between automobile emissions and NH3 concentrations in freeway runoff \n\nwas demonstrated by Pitt and Maestre (2005).  \n\nAnthropogenic sources of air pollution can also act as sources of many metals in urban \n\nenvironments (Ellis et al., 1986; Yu et al., 2014). Based on moss bags and total deposition \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n29 \n\ncollectors installed in seven urban sites throughout London, Duggan and Burton (1983) \n\ncalculated mean total deposition of 193.3, 433.3, 30.0 and 2.0 \u00b5g m-2 day-1 for Pb, Zn, Cu \n\nand Cd, respectively. In Milwaukee, USA, rainfall falling in residential areas exhibited a \n\n10-fold higher mass rate of metals (Zn, Cu, Cd, Ni, Pb, Hg and Ag) than open land areas, \n\ndue to vehicular traffic emissions (Soonthornnonda et al., 2008). In Shanghai, a \n\nsignificant amount of heavy metals identified in sediments from the lake was provided by \n\ndust from coal combustion (represented 50% of Pb concentration) and vehicular traffic \n\n(10\u201330% of total Pb and Hg content) (Li et al., 2012). \n\nOverland flow has been considered by several authors as the major non-point source of \n\npollutants at the catchment scale (e.g. Bannerman et al., 1993; Qian et al., 2002). \n\nImpervious surfaces have been considered as a concentrator and transporter of pollutants, \n\nmainly due to its efficient capacity to convert rainfall into overland flow. In many cases, \n\noverland flow from impervious areas is piped directly to streams, rather than filtered \n\nthrough soils.  \n\nOverland flow from impervious surfaces is typically associated with several pollutants, \n\nparticularly heavy metals (Zhang et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2014), nutrients (Gilbert and \n\nClausen, 2006; Ouyang et al., 2009), major ions (e.g., sulphate, nitrate, chloride, calcium, \n\nmagnesium and potassium) (Rose, 2002), pesticides (Hatt et al., 2004) and faecal \n\ncoliforms (Gregory and Frick, 2000; Mallin et al., 2000). \n\nIn USA, Schueler (2003) reported 2.0 mg L-1 of TN and 0.26 mg L-1 of TP as typical \n\nconcentrations in urban stormwater runoff. In Seattle, Washington, under baseline \n\nconditions, streamflow from urban areas displayed average TN, TP and dissolved P \n\nconcentrations higher than in forest streams (greater values by 44%, 95%, and 122%, \n\nrespectively) (Brett et al., 2005). Urban impervious surfaces (18%) within a forest and \n\nagricultural catchment in Indianapolis, Indiana, also led to greater TN, TP and total Pb \n\nloads (24%, 22% and 43%), associated with higher annual runoff (34%) (Lim et al., \n\n2006). In the peri-urban stream around Shanghai, East China, nitrogen and phosphorus \n\nconcentrations were much higher than in agricultural streams (NH4: 9.2 mg L\n-1 vs. 1.5 mg \n\nL-1, TP: 1.4 mg L-1 vs 0.2 mg L-1) (Qian et al., 2002). Shields et al. (2008) also reported \n\nhigher nitrogen exports with increasing urbanization, with particularly high values in fully \n\nurbanized catchments than in low-density peri-urban, agricultural and forest catchments.  \n\nOther land-uses within mixed catchments can also influence surface water quality. In a \n\nrapidly developing mixed land-use catchment in southeastern China, urban areas were the \n\ndominant contributor of Pb and Cd loads, whereas farmland provided most of the Cu, Zn, \n\nCd and Mn loads. Forest and green land did not supply metal loads (except Cr) into \n\nstreamwater (Yu et al., 2014). Nevertheless, G\u00f6bel et al. (2007) identified Cu and Zn, as \n\nwell as Ni, as typical metals associated with urban land-uses in German.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \u2013 URBAN AND PERI-URBAN LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON \n\nHYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND SURFACE WATER QUALITY: A REVIEW  \n\n \n\n30 \n\nMallin et al. (2000) found that % impervious surface was the single most important \n\ndetermining factor of faecal coliform (FC) contamination in coastal catchments of North \n\nCarolina, explaining 95% of the variability in average FC abundance. In western Georgia, \n\na study performed within 18 mixed land-use catchments revealed nitrogen and FC \n\nconcentrations within catchments having more than 24% impervious surface to be higher \n\nthan non-urban catchments, both under baseflow (N: 1.64 mg L-1 vs. 0.61 mg L-1 and FC: \n\n430 vs. 120 MPN100 mL-1) and storm flow conditions (N: 1.93 mg L-1 vs. 0.36 mg L-1 \n\nand FC: 1600 vs. 167 MPN100 mL-1) (Schoonover and Lockaby, 2006).  \n\n \n\n2.3.2. Contributions from different impervious surfaces \n\nIt is usually accepted that pollutant loads tend to increase directly with % TIA. Thus, \n\nseveral authors have been considering this parameter has an indicator of the ecological \n\nand environmental conditions of an aquatic system (Schueler, 1994; Arnold and Gibbons, \n\n1996; Paul and Meyer, 2001; Morse et al., 2003; Kuusisto-Hjort and Hjort, 2013). Brabec \n\net al. (2002) identified different thresholds of TIA for different water quality parameters. \n\nThresholds ranged from 8% for oxygen to 30-50% for other chemical properties and 5-\n\n50% for physical variables. Other authors have also identified different impervious \n\nthresholds for specific water quality parameters. For example, Griffin et al. (1980) \n\nidentified a 42% impervious cover for degradation due to nutrients, May et al. (1997) \n\nrecognised a 45% for phosphorus and Horner et al. (1997) reported a 50% imperviousness \n\nfor significant metals increase in streamwater quality, but only 40% in the case of zinc. \n\nAquatic ecosystems may be affected by a combination of pollutants rather than by \n\nindividual water quality parameters. As a result, Schiff and Benoit (2007) considered that \n\na threshold of 5-10% TIA can impair water quality due to urbanization effects. On the \n\nother hand, Exum et al. (2005) suggested that 5-10% TIA produces modest impacts \n\nrelated to urbanization, which can be addressed through planning and catchment \n\nmanagement. These authors considered that urbanization of only 10-20% TIA can lead to \n\nsignificant aquatic degradation, whereas for catchments exceeding 20% TIA the \n\nlikelihood of successful remediation efforts being able to improve water quality are \n\nminimal. Schueler (1994) reviewed eleven published studies and reported their evidence \n\nthat stream quality declines at 10 to 15% imperviousness. Based on a review of different \n\nstudies, Arnold and Gibbons (1996) also defined a 10% TIA threshold for minimum \n\ndegradation start and a 30% threshold for unavoidable impacts. Based on the magnitude \n\nof the impacts of TIA, Arnold and Gibbons (1996) suggested a classification of the stream \n\nhealth \u201cwhich can be roughly characterized as \u2018protected\u2019 (<10% impervious surface), \n\n\u2018impacted\u2019 (10%-30% impervious surface), and \u2018degraded\u2019 (>30% impervious surface).\u201d \n\nAlthough the establishment of an impervious cover threshold can be very useful for \n\nmanagement purposes, results from different studies are not unanimous. Differences \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n31 \n\nbetween the reported thresholds can be driven by site-specific characteristics of the \n\ncatchment, such as the proportion of different types of impervious surfaces.  \n\nImpervious surfaces within urban areas are mostly represented by rooftops and roads, \n\nboth characterized by distinct pollutant loads, with different potential impacts on \n\ncatchments\u2019 water quality. A number of studies have reported the release of certain \n\ncompounds from rooftops during rainfall events (Athanasiadis et al., 2007). Because of \n\nthis, rooftop runoff can be an important source of pollutants for the aquatic ecosystems. \n\nGromaire et al. (2001) compared the runoff pollution in an urban district in Paris, France, \n\nderived from rooftops (54% of the area) with different types of covering material (Zn \n\nsheet, slate, interlocking tiles, flat tiles) and guttering (Zn, Cu, cast Fe), streets (22%) and \n\nimpervious miscellaneous structures (24%). The results showed that rooftops contributed \n\nmore than 80% of the Cd, Pb and Zn contamination during the wet season in the combined \n\nsewer system. The runoff from sawmill rooftops along Washington coast also exceeded \n\nthe water quality guidelines for Cu, Pb and Zn in all the samples tested (Good, 1993). In \n\nAustin, Texas, the runoff from a rooftop of an Army fort contributed as much as 55% of \n\nthe specific heavy metal concentrations measured in the total catchment loads (Van Metre \n\nand Mahler, 2003).  \n\nOther authors, however, reported a low impact from rooftop runoff. For example, \n\nSimmons et al. (2001) measured the concentration of heavy metals (Zn, Cu and Pb) in the \n\nrunoff of 125 domestic rooftops in four rural areas of Auckland, New Zealand, but only \n\na few sites exceeded the drinking water standards: 14%, 2% and 1% of the sites for Pb, \n\nCu and Zn, respectively.  \n\nThe type of roof material, the age and the conservation status of the roof are important \n\nparameters on runoff properties and pollutant loads (e.g. Chang et al., 2004; Adeniyi and \n\nOlabanji, 2005). Schriewer et al. (2008) studied the runoff properties from a 14 years old \n\nzinc roof and measured mean concentration of 4.9 mg Zn L-1. According to a study by the \n\nGerman Federal Environmental Agency, roof runoff in Germany releases almost \n\n85.2 tonnes of copper every year (UBA, 2005). A detailed review of rooftop runoff \n\npollution is given by Lye (2009).  \n\nSome authors have considered roads has a major source of pollutants within urban \n\ncatchments, particularly due to the heavy metal composition (e.g. Ellis et al., 1986; \n\nBannerman et al., 1993; Herngren et al., 2004). Studies in Europe and USA catchments \n\nencompassing highways reported maximum heavy metal loads of 244, 499 and 288 \u00b5g \n\nm-2 day-1 for Pb, Zn and Cu, respectively (Mance, 1982; Randall et al., 1979). However, \n\nroad runoff properties are highly variable. For a highway in metropolitan London, UK, \n\nwith 500 vehicles day-1, Ellis et al. (1986) measured a metal removal rate varying between \n\n15.6 and 167 \u00b5g m-2 day-1 for Pb, 17.2-194 \u00b5g m-2 day-1 for Zn and 4.9-69.2 \u00b5g m-2 day-1 \n\nfor Cu. Greatest variability of pollutants concentration was even reported by Crabtree et \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \u2013 URBAN AND PERI-URBAN LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON \n\nHYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND SURFACE WATER QUALITY: A REVIEW  \n\n \n\n32 \n\nal. (2006), based on runoff discharges from several highways across UK: 2.1 - 304.0 ?g \n\nL-1 of Cu, 5.0 - 1360 ?g L-1 of Zn and &lt;0.01 - 5.40 ?g L-1 of Cd. In Western Washington \n\nState, however, runoff properties from 35 highways varied less, displaying 3.1 - 18.1 ?g \n\nL-1 of Cu, 13 - 134 ?g L-1 of Zn and 0.9 - 2.8 ?g L-1 of Cd (Herrera Environmental \n\nConsultants, 2007).  \n\nSpatial and temporal differences in road runoff composition can be due to several \n\nparameters, such as: \n\n \n\n? Vehicular traffic  \n\nBesides the impact of gas exhaustion discussed on section 2.3.1., wear of vehicles \n\ncomponents, such as tyres and brakes, as well as fluid losses, can be important sources of \n\npollutants in road runoff, but also in the runoff from car parks and service stations (Ellis \n\net al., 1986; Sullivan et al., 1978; Bannerman et al., 1993; Soares, 2014). \n\nIn several small peri-urban catchments around Madison, Wisconsin, the runoff from \n\nstreets, driveways and parking lots supplied 21% and 28% of the dissolved and total \n\nphosphorus loads of the surface waters (Waschbusch et al., 1999). \n\nA positive relationship between the amount of vehicular traffic and pollutant \n\nconcentrations has been described in several studies. Steuer et al. (1997) reported nitrogen \n\nand phosphorus concentrations in the runoff from high traffic streets to be twice as high \n\nas in low-traffic streets (TN: 2.95 mg L-1 vs 1.17 mg L-1; TP: 0.31 mg L-1 vs 0.14 mg L-\n\n1). Pollution from traffic also varies with urban type. For example, in UK, a sub-catchment \n\ndominated by a highway showed three times more Fe and a 16-fold increase of Cu than a \n\nresidential area (Ellis et al., 1986).  \n\nSimilarly, Herngren et al. (2004) measured, through rainfall simulation experiments, \n\ngreater runoff pollution in a road in a highly urbanized area (dominated by town houses) \n\nthan on an access road in suburban residential area of Brisbane, Australia. Suspended \n\nsediment concentration was almost twice higher in the highly urbanized than suburban \n\narea. As regards to organic carbon compounds, dissolved fractions were twice as high in \n\nthe most urbanized area, but three times higher for total organic compounds. Greater \n\nmetals concentration in the highly urbanized area were also found, particularly as regards \n\nto Al (17 times higher in the dissolved fraction, but only 2 times higher for the total \n\nfraction) and Fe (8 times higher in the dissolved fraction and slightly higher in the total \n\nfraction). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons also displayed 15 times greater dissolved \n\nfraction concentration and 40 times more total fraction in the road of the highly urbanized \n\narea. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n33 \n\n? Pavement material, conservation status and management activities  \n\nPavement material influences surface permeability and pollutant accumulation rates \n\n(Sartor and Boyd, 1972; Gilbert and Clausen, 2006). Furthermore, it affects the release of \n\nchemical compounds and thus, the sort of pollutants washed-off. This is also influenced \n\nby the conservation or degradation status of the road surface (Sartor and Boyd, 1972), as \n\nwell as by cleaning activities. Street sweeping may have an adverse impact on pollutant \n\nwash-off because it releases the finer material of the pavement, which is not removed by \n\nthe cleaning equipments (e.g. due to the reduced suction), making the fine sediments \n\navailable for wash-off during the next storm (Vaze and Chiew, 2002).  \n\nManagement activities during colder weather conditions, linked to sand and de-icing \n\nmaterials commonly applied to assure safe road driving, can also have a detrimental \n\nimpact on water resources. Interlandi and Crockett (2003) measured increasing \n\nstreamwater concentrations of chloride (37%) and sodium (25%) as a result of salts \n\ndeposited on roadways of Philadelphia. \n\n \n\n? Rainfall and runoff  \n\nRainfall intensity determines the available energy to overcome the initial resistance \n\nprovided by both the amplitude and scale of surface roughness (Athayde et al., 1982), \n\nwhereas rainfall amount determines the runoff volume generated. Runoff volume \n\ninfluences both pollutant removal rates (Helsel, 1978) and the dilution factor (Deutsch \n\nand Hemain, 1984). In a highway surface of metropolitan area of London, UK, Ellis et al. \n\n(1986) found that storm duration and runoff volume together explain over 90% of the \n\nobserved variance in Pb, Cd, Mn and sediment loads, as well as 79% of Zn concentration.  \n\n \n\n? Antecedent dry period \n\nThe extent of time without rainfall determines the amount of pollutant material deposited \n\non road surface resulting from vehicular traffic, pavement degradation and atmospheric \n\ndeposition (Sullivan et al., 1978; Owe et al., 1982; Zhang et al., 2007; Qin et al., 2013). \n\nAccording to Marsalek (1976), the antecedent dry period (ADP) explained 83-92% of the \n\nvariance in heavy metal concentrations from road runoff. Based on the study of a road \n\nsurface in a Melbourne urban area, Vaze and Chiew (2002) demonstrated that pollutant \n\nbuild-up (accumulation) over dry days occurs relatively quickly after a rainfall event, but \n\nslows down after several days as redistribution by wind occurs. \n\n \n\n2.3.3. Land-use contributions for water quality \n\nThe complex land-use pattern of peri-urban areas provide distinct sources of pollutants. \n\nGenerally, agricultural and vegetated areas are associated with nutrient sources (e.g. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \u2013 URBAN AND PERI-URBAN LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON \n\nHYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND SURFACE WATER QUALITY: A REVIEW  \n\n \n\n34 \n\nCrawford and Lenat, 1989; Groffman et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2007), whereas urban \n\nareas are mostly associated with heavy metal and organic pollutants to streamwater \n\npollution (e.g. Pitt and Maestre 2005; Yu et al., 2012).  \n\nDiffuse pollution from agricultural fields, particularly associated with high concentrations \n\nof NO3, have been widely reported due to fertilizer application (Oakes et al., 1981; \n\nAddiscott et al., 1991). Groffman et al. (2004) reported NO3 losses from agricultural \n\ncatchments to be 2-4 times higher than urban/peri-urban catchments in Baltimore. \n\nCrawford and Lenat (1989) also found greater nutrient concentrations in streams from \n\nagricultural catchments comparing with catchments dominated by forest and urban land-\n\nuses. On the other hand, highest temperatures and concentrations of heavy metals were \n\nfound in the urban catchments (Crawford and Lenat, 1989).  \n\nLivestock manure and sludge application into agricultural fields can represent additional \n\nrisks of nutrients and heavy metal contaminations of rivers and groundwater (Gupta and \n\nCharles, 1999; Antonious et al., 2008). In a peri-urban region of Vietnam, the application \n\nof livestock manure provided a surplus of 85 to 882 kg ha-1 year-1 of nitrogen, 109 to 196 \n\nkg ha-1 year-1 of phosphorus and 20\u2013306 kg ha-1 year-1 of potassium. According to Khai \n\net al. (2007), sludge application in agricultural fields of Hanoi, Southeast Asia, leaded to \n\nhigh accumulation of heavy metals in the soil, ranging between 0.2 to 2.7 and 0.6 to 7.7 \n\nkg ha-1 year-1 of Cu and Zn. \n\nIn the Yellow River catchment, Asia, farmland and forestry were found to be the main \n\nsources of nitrogen and phosphorus (Ouyang et al., 2009). In Gold Coast, Australia, \n\ngreatest total organic carbon concentrations were also found in surface waters from \n\ncatchments dominated by forestry than other land-uses. In forest areas, nutrients release \n\nare provided by the degradation and leachate from the leaf litter, supplied by the extensive \n\ntree canopy (Goonetilleke et al., 2005).  \n\nZhang et al. (2007) studied the impact of two contrasting peri-urban areas in the Yangtze \n\nRiver of China, comparing a vegetable-based (VB) area, dominated by agricultural fields \n\nused for vegetables production, with a factory-based (FB) area, encompassing 400 small-\n\nscale factories producing a variety of materials including chemicals, fertilizers, pesticides \n\nand steel. The surface water in the VB area had significantly higher levels of NO3, organic \n\nN and TN than those in the FB area. In contrast, heavy metal concentrations in the surface \n\nwater from the FB area were higher than those in the VB area.  \n\nDespite agricultural and forest areas being considered important non-point sources of \n\nnutrients, the lower amount of runoff produced limits the loads of pollutants reaching the \n\nstream network (Ouyang et al., 2009).  \n\nThe type of urban land-use influences pollutant contribution to the stream network. For \n\nexample, based on the study of 200 municipalities of Alabama, USA, Pitt and Maestre \n\n(2005) demonstrated substantial differences in the chemical composition of the runoff \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n35 \n\nfrom distinct urban land-uses (industrial, residential and commercial areas, freeways and \n\nopen spaces). Industrial areas showed the greatest concentrations of nitrogen oxide (0.73 \n\nmg L-1 NO2+NO3), Cd (2.0 \u00b5g L\n-1) and Cr (14.0 \u00b5g L-1). Together with freeways, \n\nindustrial areas showed the highest concentrations of Pb (both had 25 \u00b5g L-1) and Zn (200 \n\n\u00b5g L-1 and 210 \u00b5g L-1, respectively), as a result of gas emissions. Freeways showed greater \n\nconcentrations of total suspended sediments (99 mg L-1), COD (100 mg L-1), NH3 (1.07 \n\nmg L-1), phosphorus (0.20 mg L-1) and Cu (\u00b5g L-1) than all the other land-uses. On the \n\nother hand, residential areas showed the highest faecal coliform concentration (8345 \n\nMPN 100 mL-1), due to sewer contamination. Open spaces showed the lowest values of \n\nCOD (42 mg L-1), NH3 (0.18 mg L\n-1), Cd (0.38 \u00b5g L-1), Cu (10 \u00b5g L-1), Pb (10 \u00b5g L-1) \n\nand Zn (40 \u00b5g L-1), whereas freeways showed the lowest values of NO2+NO3 (0.28 mg \n\nL-1). \n\nThe intensity of urbanization has been reported by some authors as a major parameter \n\ninfluencing water quality impacts (e.g. Mallin and Wheeler, 2000). A comparative study \n\nfocusing on surface water quality from 28 urban and peri-urban catchments in USA, \n\nindicated decreasing loading rates of nutrients (TP, TN, NO3+NO2, and NH3) from low \n\nhouse density to high density (USEPA, 1983). The difference between the urban areas of \n\nhigh and low density reached 90% of the nutrient loads. In the Grand Canal of China, \n\nsurface water quality also showed increasing levels of nutrients (TN and TP) and \n\ndissolved metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr and Mn) from towns (<150000 inhabitants) to large \n\ncities (up to 2200000 inhabitants) (Yu et al., 2012).  \n\nThe form of urban settlements is another parameter reported on literature with impacts on \n\nsurface water. Corbetts et al. (1997) measured higher sediment yelds in the runoff \n\ngenererated from dispersed impervious surfaces than from clustered development areas, \n\ndespite no significant different runoff volume. This was because of less protection to the \n\nsoil surface. Goonetilleke et al. (2005) also reported greater pollutant loads from detached \n\nhouses than multifamily dwelling units, possibly due to greater extent of road surface area \n\nbut also landscaped gardens. Greater extent of gardens/open spaces and the associated \n\napplication of fertilisers, explained the high nitrogen loads in runoff from duplex housing \n\ndevelopments comparing with single detached-dwelling areas.  \n\nIncreasing nutrient concentration in urban catchments have been attributed to green areas \n\nand their management activities, particularly fertilization. Steuer et al. (1997) reported \n\nthat runoff concentrations from lawns contributed five to ten times more nutrients than \n\nother landscape surfaces, such as streets, into Lake Superior in Michigan. Besides \n\nfertilization, grass clipping can be another source of nutrients in urban green areas, \n\nparticularly of nitrogen (Goonetilleke et al., 2005) but also COD (Schoonover and \n\nLockaby, 2006).  \n\nNutrient losses from urban green areas have been considered similar to forest areas. Gold \n\net al. (1990) reported similar nitrogen losses in leachate from home lawns and forest areas. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \u2013 URBAN AND PERI-URBAN LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON \n\nHYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND SURFACE WATER QUALITY: A REVIEW  \n\n \n\n36 \n\nGroffman et al. (2009) suggested similar carbon cycling rates between turfgrass and \n\nforest. However, the different growing stages of the vegetation can lead to seasonal \n\nvariation in nutrient losses (May et al., 2001; Ouyang et al., 2009). For instance, Wherley \n\net al. (2009) reported greater NO3 uptake during the active growth period of summer \n\n(>90%), slightly decreasing during fall and spring transition months (80-90%) and being \n\nsignificantly reduced during winter dormancy (10-20%).  \n\nAlthough urban green areas can be important sources of nutrients, mostly due to \n\ninappropriate management practices (e.g. fertilization and irrigation) performed to \n\nmaintain the desired aesthetic characteristics (Gross et al., 1990; Easton and Petrovic, \n\n2004), these areas may have a positive impact on catchment water quality. Some \n\nresearchers highlighted the capacity of lawns to retain nutrients within residential areas \n\n(Groffman et al., 2004). Furthermore, the low runoff generated on green pervious urban \n\nsurfaces also limit the rate of nutrient losses.  \n\nBased on rainfall simulation experiments performed in different pervious surfaces, Ross \n\nand Dillaha (1993) measured limited runoff amount from grass and turf surfaces (5% and \n\n3%), associated with small amounts of suspended sediment, but 3 times more soluble \n\nphosphorus in grass than turf cover. Nevertheless, runoff from grass and turf displayed \n\nsimilar soluble nitrate loads than runoff from bare soil, despite the greatest runoff \n\ncoefficient of the latter (33%). Nevertheless, the runoff from the bare soil was linked with \n\ngreater total suspended sediments (3-fold), soluble nitrate and phosphorus (11- and 13-\n\nfolds) than a gravel driveway (51% runoff coefficient). Meadow and mulched landscape \n\ndid not produce runoff.  \n\nDifferences in runoff characteristics from various pervious surfaces are critical to land-\n\nuse planning, because land-uses vary widely in their ability to absorb or shed rainfall and \n\nthus, transport sediment and pollutants. Some researchers have stressed the relevance to \n\nidentify the areas prone to generate pollutants, called sensitive or critical areas, in order \n\nto improve catchment management (Thompson et al., 2012; Easton et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n2.3.4. Influence of landscape connectivity  \n\nThe multiple mosaic features determined by different land-uses over the peri-urban \n\ncatchments are very complex in terms of potential sources and sinks of runoff pollutants, \n\nas discussed in the previous sections. The research studies above cited highlight that \n\nimperviousness may not be the only or even the most important catchment variable, since \n\nthe pervious surfaces, such as vegetated areas, can represent an important source of \n\nnutrients.  \n\nNevertheless, the impact of land-uses on surface water quality is dependent on the flow \n\nconnectivity within a catchment, which is affected by the location of pollutant sources \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n37 \n\nand the downslope land-use and land cover (LULC). Considering the greater runoff \n\nvolume and pollutant loads from impervious surfaces, the placement of these \n\ninfrastructures within a catchment influences the possible absorption by pervious surfaces \n\nand, thus, the amount and speed with which contaminants in flow enters the stream (under \n\nnatural conditions, without runoff piped directly to the stream) (Carey et al., 2011). \n\nOverland flow infiltration or retention in surface depressions is the key to accomplish \n\nnutrients and pollutants removal and prevent environmental risks (Horner et al. 1997; \n\nBrabec et al. 2002; Easton et al., 2007; Thompson et al., 2012), by breaking flow \n\nconnectivity and using soil as a filter.  \n\nWickham et al. (2002) modelled alternative land-use change scenarios in the mid-Atlantic \n\nregion of the USA to identify the most vulnerable areas to increased N and P exports. \n\nAreas with a forest and agricultural land-use with a ratio of 6:1 and projected urbanization \n\nrates of 20%, were vulnerable to increased N export; at similar urbanization rates, P \n\nvulnerability increased in areas with a 2:1 forest and agriculture ratio.  \n\nHowever, depending on the location and extent of forest areas, they can contribute \n\nconsiderably to water quality protection, especially due to the high infiltration capacity \n\nand thus, the ability to act as sinks of overland flow and pollutants (Groffman et al., 2002; \n\nLorz et al., 2007).  \n\nFew studies have investigated the role of riparian vegetation as an effective solution for \n\nreducing non-point sources of nutrients. Hicks and Larson (1997) explored the \n\nrelationship between imperviousness, forest cover and the width of riparian buffer on \n\nstream chemistry. The authors reported the degradation of water quality with increasing \n\nimperviousness and decreasing forest and riparian buffer cover. No discernible human \n\nimpact on water quality was found on catchments with 4% impervious surface, >50% \n\nforest land-use and riparian buffer of 60 m in more than 80% of the stream network. A \n\nlow level of impact was reported in catchments with 9% impervious surface, 30-50% \n\nforest stand and 50-80% of riparian buffer. A moderate level of impact was described in \n\ncatchments with 10-15% impervious surface, 10-29% forest area, and 20-49% riparian \n\nbuffer. A high level of impact was showed in catchments with 15% impervious surface, \n\n10% forest stand, and&lt;20% riparian buffer.  \n\nThe role of riparian vegetation on surface water quality was also investigated by \n\nSteedman (1988), who found an inverse relation between the extent of riparian cover and \n\nimpervious surfaces on sustainable biological integrity of the aquatic ecosystem. This \n\nauthor reported that in catchments without urban areas, 75% of the riparian forest could \n\nbe removed without detrimental impacts on aquatic communities, but no riparian forest \n\nshould be removed for a 55% urbanizated catchment. In turn, Horner et al. (1997) \n\nidentified a threshold of 45% impervious surfaces for cease the effective protection of \n\nriverine systems provided by riparian buffers. Nonetheless, Roth et al. (1996) found that \n\nregional land-use was more important than local riparian vegetation for stream integrity. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \u2013 URBAN AND PERI-URBAN LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON \n\nHYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND SURFACE WATER QUALITY: A REVIEW  \n\n \n\n38 \n\nIn peri-urban and urban catchments, artificial drainage systems provide higher \n\nconnectivity between pollutant sources and the stream network. Ouyang et al. (2009) \n\nhighlighted the role of the artificial drainage system on phosphorus linkage between \n\nfarmland areas and streamflow. In urban areas, Bannerman et al. (1993) demonstrated the \n\nwater quality impacts of the overall connectivity between road runoff and the stream \n\nnetwork, whereas only 2% of the roof runoff reached the stream.   \n\nIn recent years, runoff channelling have been considered in order to evaluate pollutant \n\npathways. The term directly connected impervious area (DCIA) covers the impervious \n\nsurfaces that are hydrologically linked to the watercourses (Booth and Jackson, 1997). \n\nSome authors have been stressing the relevance of DCIA percentage rather than TIA \n\npercentage on pollutant loads reaching urban streams (Brabec et al., 2002).  \n\nBased on modelling results, Wilson and Weng (2010) demonstrated that the spatio-\n\ntemporal variation in areas that contribute towards runoff, i.e. the spatial extent of \n\nhydrologically active areas within a catchment, are more important than the spatial extent \n\nof LULC for surface water quality. \n\n \n\n2.3.5. Temporal variation of pollutant sources  \n\nPollutant sources and transport mechanisms are directly linked to the hydrological \n\nprocesses, and thus, associated with temporal variation between overland flow processes \n\nand hydrological connectivity at catchment scale.  \n\nSchoonover and Lockaby (2006) considered the hydrological processes to explain the \n\nminor impact of a heavily grazed catchment (>25%) on streamwater quality. The free \n\ncattle access and the deposition of faecal material near the stream channel provided a low \n\nfaecal coliform concentration in the stream. This was explained by the insufficient volume \n\nof surface runoff generated and/or energy to transport faecal coliform bacteria from the \n\npastures to the streams.  \n\nTemporal variation of pollutant sources are influenced by the rainfall pattern, since it is \n\nthe driver of the hydrological processes, as discussed in section 2.2.3.. In a hydrologically \n\nisolated grassland hillslope in Co. Down, Northern Ireland, overland flow was highly \n\nvariable and dependent on rainfall intensity. There were some areas of the hillslope that \n\neither did not generate overland flow or generated overland flow that was not connected \n\nthrough flow pathways. The size of the area prone to generate overland flow ranged \n\nbetween 20% and 80% of the hillslope, and was found to control the streamflow variation \n\nand temporal changes on dissolved phosphorus inputs. However, it did not seem to \n\nexplain the particulate phosphorus concentration, which may be due to rapid exhaustion \n\nof fine particles, and a switching from transport-limited to detachment-limited processes \n\nat early stages in each storm (Thompson et al., 2012). \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n39 \n\nAntecedent climatic conditions, particularly the length of time without rainfall, is an \n\nimportant parameter determining not only the flow connectivity over the catchment \n\nduring rainfall events, but also the build-up and wash-off processes from different land-\n\nuses and, therefore, pollutants composition and loading (Goonetilleke et al., 2005). \n\nGenerally, rainfall events with longer ADP have more pollutant build-up at the beginning \n\nof the rainfall, thus higher pollutant loads can be potentially flushed off during rainfall \n\nevents, as referred in section 2.2.3.. Greater rainfall amount has the ability to flush off the \n\nhigher amount of pollutants deposited over the catchment, leading to higher Event Mean \n\nConcentration (EMC) on streamflow. However, when the capacity of pollutant wash-off \n\nis greater than the pollutant build-up, additional rainfall causes lower EMC due to a \n\ndilution effect.  \n\nThe influence of ADP on pollutant availability and transport over the hillslope has been \n\nconsidered to explain distinct EMCs resulting from similar rainfall events (Qin et al., \n\n2013), as well as seasonal variation on runoff quality (Interlandi and Crockett, 2003; Lee \n\net al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2007). In a mixed land-use catchment in Galicia, Spain, \n\nRodr\u00edguez-Blanco et al. (2013) reported that 68% of phosphorus transport was influenced \n\nby storm events. In a small catchment in Macau, Huang et al. (2007) showed that mean \n\nconcentration of COD ranged from 41 to 464 mg L-1 between five rainfall events. Qin et \n\nal. (2013) found maximum EMC for COD over five times higher than the minimum value \n\nin a typical urbanizing area of China.  \n\nIn Mediterranean regions, summer droughts create a long period for pollutant build-up \n\nand, therefore, the initial storm of the wet season may have higher pollutant \n\nconcentrations than later events (Lee et al., 2009). However, few researchers have \n\ndetermined the effect of the ADP in their studies of stormwater discharge, particularly in \n\nMediterranean environments. This deficiency is one of the research gaps trackeled in this \n\nthesis. \n\n \n\n2.4. Final considerations \n\nLand-use changes, particularly associated with urbanization, have impacts on catchment \n\nhydrology, but the magnitudes of the changes are dependent on several local biophysical \n\ncharacteristics, which determine the flow connectivity over the landscape. Only in recent \n\nyears has flow connectivity been recognised as a major parameter influencing the \n\nhydrological processes and the catchment response (e.g. Shuster et al., 2005; Bracken et \n\nal., 2013).  \n\nFlow connectivity is driven by the spatial distribution of runoff sources, particularly \n\nimpervious surfaces, as well as temporal variation associated with climate and weather. \n\nGenerally, urban areas are considered one of the most important runoff sources within \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \u2013 URBAN AND PERI-URBAN LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON \n\nHYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND SURFACE WATER QUALITY: A REVIEW  \n\n \n\n40 \n\ndevelopment catchments, but under wet conditions, increasing soil moisture favours the \n\nflow connectivity within the landscape, thus the runoff contributions from other land-uses \n\nmay become increasingly important for streamflow variation. \n\nDespite several studies focusing on the impact of land-use changes and advances in \n\nhydrological processes understanding, the runoff processes from mixed land-use patterns \n\nand their impact at the catchment scale are not fully understood. Mosaics of different \n\nland-uses provide a combination of fast and slow responses, runoff sources and water \n\nfluxes over the landscape. Mosaic landscapes are typical of peri-urban areas, but the \n\nrelative lack of available hydrological data, limits understanding of hydrological \n\nprocesses within these areas. Despite the spatial variation of runoff processes, \n\nunderstanding the temporal fluctuation of soil moisture, as well as the relation between \n\nrainfall and overland flow processes, particularly in seasonal climates such as the \n\nMediterranean, remains a major challenge on hydrology. \n\nSurface water quality is undoubtedly coupled to the hydrological regime. Different land-\n\nuses are associated with different pollutants, with green areas usually recognized as \n\npotential sources of nutrients, whereas urban land-uses can be important sources of heavy \n\nmetals, organic and microbial pollution. Flow connectivity between pollutant sources and \n\nthe stream network has been considered a key issue for surface water quality. However, \n\nthe relationship between land-use sources and the mechanisms of transmission and \n\ndispersion of pollutants over the catchment is still not fully understood.   \n\nImproved knowledge about the spatio-temporal pattern of runoff processes and its impact \n\non surface hydrology and water quality is important to improve catchment management \n\nand urban planning in order to minimize flood hazard and pollution risks. Furthermore, \n\nthis information should guide decision-makers to establish and implement strategies to \n\nsolve current problems within the catchments. Management strategies to minimize runoff \n\nand pollutant loads, require understanding of the sources and their temporal variation \n\nresulting from rainfall characteristics and antecedent weather conditions. These will allow \n\nthe implementation of cost-efficient measures to prevent runoff and pollution problems, \n\nas well as raise awareness on local population.\n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3  \n\nSPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF HYDROLOGIC \n\nSOIL PROPERTIES AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR \n\nOVERLAND FLOW AND LAND MANAGEMENT  \n\n3.1.

The temporal and spatial \n\npatterns of overland flow source areas and their connectivity in the landscape, particularly \n\nin a seasonal climate, remain comparatively poorly understood. This study investigates \n\nseasonal variations in factors influencing runoff response to rainfall in a peri-urban \n\ncatchment in Portugal, characterized by a mosaic of landscape units and a sub-humid \n\nMediterranean climate. Variations in surface soil moisture, hydrophobicity and \n\ninfiltration capacity were measured in six different landscape units (defined by land-use \n\non either sandstone or limestone), during nine monitoring campaigns at key times over a \n\none-year period.  \n\nSpatio-temporal patterns in overland flow mechanisms were found. Infiltration-excess \n\noverland flow was generated in rainfalls during the dry summer season in woodland on \n\nboth sandstone and limestone and on agricultural soils on limestone due probably in large \n\npart to soil hydrophobicity. In wet periods, saturation overland flow occurred on urban \n\nand agricultural soils located in valley bottoms and on shallow soils upslope. Topography, \n\nwater table rise and soil depth determined the location and extent of saturated areas. \n\nOverland flow generated in upslope source areas potentially can infiltrate in other \n\nlandscape units downslope where infiltration capacity exceeds rainfall intensity. \n\nHydrophilic urban and agricultural-sandstone soils were characterized by increased \n\ninfiltration capacity during dry periods, while forest soils provided potential sinks for \n\noverland flow when hydrophilic in the winter wet season. Identifying the spatial and \n\ntemporal variability of overland flow sources and sinks is an important step in \n\nunderstanding and modelling flow connectivity and catchment hydrologic response. Such \n\ninformation is important for land managers in order to improve urban planning to \n\nminimize flood risk.   \n\n \n\nKeywords: soil moisture, soil hydrophobicity, infiltration capacity, Mediterranean, \n\nspatial and temporal variability, landscape units, overland flow, flow connectivity.   \n\n \n\n3.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \u2013 SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF HYDROLOGIC SOIL PROPERTIES \n\nAND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERLAND FLOW AND LAND MANAGEMENT  \n\n \n\n44 \n\n3.1. Introduction \n\nLand-use changes associated with urbanization strongly affect hydrological processes. \n\nResearch into the hydrological effects of urbanization has focused on its impact on runoff \n\nprocesses, but conclusions have proved difficult to extrapolate because of the complex \n\ninterplay of such parameters as climatic setting (Boyd et al., 1993; Costa et al., 2003), \n\ngeologically-controlled topography (Wilson et al., 2005), soil properties (L\u00f3pez-Vicente \n\net al., 2009; Hardie et al., 2011), vegetation and land-use (Mallick et al., 2009), including \n\nland-use change history, the percentage of impervious surface and its spatial arrangement \n\n(e.g. Konrad and Booth, 2005). Variation in the combined effect of these factors is \n\narguably the main reason for observed differences in impact of urban land-use change on \n\nhydrology. \n\nSoil moisture, linked to storage capacity, is recognized as a major runoff-controlling \n\nfactor, particularly in a Mediterranean climate (Cerd\u00e0, 1997). Its seasonal variability can \n\nmean that greater rainfall intensity is required for overland flow initiation in summer than \n\nin winter (Cammeraat, 2002). When saturation overland flow mechanisms are involved, \n\nthe influence of soil moisture is more varied and not entirely understood, particularly in \n\nurbanizing catchments where its spatial and temporal variation is rarely reported (Easton \n\net al., 2007). \n\nAlthough there have been many studies of soil hydrophobicity and its impacts on \n\ninfiltration and overland flow processes in a range of seasonal and sub-humid \n\nenvironments (e.g. Glenn and Finley, 2010; Carrick et al., 2011; Orf\u00e1nus et al., 2014), in \n\nareas of Mediterranean climate they have mainly focussed on forested terrain (e.g. Doerr \n\net al., 1996, 1998, 2000; Varela et al., 2005; Keizer et al., 2008; Neris et al., 2013; Nyman \n\net al., 2014). Furthermore, relatively little is known about \u2018switching\u2019 between \n\nhydrophobic and hydrophilic conditions in dry and wet periods, and the net effects on \n\ncatchment hydrological response in areas affected seasonally by soil hydrophobicity \n\n(Leighton-Boyce et al., 2005). In hydrological modelling of urbanizing areas, the \n\nphenomenon has not even been considered.  \n\nThe seasonal and spatial variability of soil moisture and hydrophobicity on heterogeneous \n\nlandscapes affects overland flow sources and sinks, and is critical in understanding flow \n\ntransfer between different landscape units (Kirkby et al., 2002; Bull et al., 2003). \n\nRelatively little research into such hydrological effects has been carried out in \n\nMediterranean environments, so the impact of marked seasonal changes on runoff \n\nprocesses is not well understood. This is even truer of peri-urban areas, which represent \n\nthe transition zone between urban and rural environments on the outskirts of cities and \n\nwhich often comprise a mosaic of land-use types. Here, better understanding of the \n\ninterplay between these factors would help in the prediction of the flow response and \n\nestimation of the overland flow amount reaching any point in a catchment (Borselli et al., \n\n2008).  \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n45 \n\nThis chapter focuses on temporal and spatial variations in key soil hydrological properties \n\n(soil moisture, hydrophobicity and infiltration capacity) in different land-uses in a small, \n\nperi-urban, partly limestone, partly sandstone catchment in central Portugal. The \n\ncatchment has changed rapidly from agricultural land and forest to a discontinuous urban \n\nfabric, with urban patches interrupting both woodland and semi-abandoned agricultural \n\nterrain. The urban areas comprise a complex mosaic of tarmac, gardens and walls, in \n\naddition to buildings and derelict ground. The distinctive mosaic pattern of the catchment \n\nis typical of Portuguese urbanization. Specific aims of the paper are to: 1) assess spatial \n\nand temporal variability of hydrological soil properties in different land-uses/lithology \n\nlandscape units in the catchment; 2) identify seasonal changes in overland flow sources; \n\n3) evaluate the impact of landscape units (characterized by different land-uses and \n\nlithologies) on flow connectivity and streamflow response; and 4) explore implications \n\nof urbanizing mosaics for landscape management and urban planning, especially with \n\nrespect to streamflow regimes and flood risk. \n\n \n\n3.2. Study area \n\nThe study site is the S-N elongated Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment (40\u00b013\u2019N, 8\u00b027\u2019W; 6.2 \n\nkm2) in the suburbs of Coimbra, the largest city of central Portugal. The climate (as \n\nrecorded at Bencanta, 0.5 km north of the catchment boundary) is sub-humid \n\nMediterranean, with a mean annual temperature of 15\u00baC, a mean annual rainfall of 892 \n\nmm (INMG, 1941-2000), hot and dry summers (8% of rainfall in the months June-\n\nAugust) and wet winters (Figure 3.1). The main watercourse is perennial, supplied by \n\nseveral springs, and there are several smaller ephemeral tributaries (Figure 3.2). The \n\ngeology (Figure 3.2a) comprises Jurassic dolomitic and marly limestone in the east (49% \n\nof the catchment area), and Cretaceous and Tertiary sandstones, conglomerates and \n\nmudstones in the west (47% of the area), with some Pliocene-Quaternary sandy-\n\nconglomerate (colluvium) and alluvial deposits (4% of the area) in the main valleys. Soils \n\nare generally deep (>3m) Cambisols and Podzols (Tavares et al., 2012). Only on steeper \n\nslopes in the northwest is soil depth less than 0.4 m. Altitude ranges from 29 m to 201 m. \n\nThe average slope is 9\u00ba, but a few slopes reach up to 46\u00ba.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \u2013 SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF HYDROLOGIC SOIL PROPERTIES \n\nAND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERLAND FLOW AND LAND MANAGEMENT  \n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 - Average monthly rainfall and temperature at Coimbra (Bencanta weather station), \n\ncalculated from data regarding to the period 1941-2000 (INMG, 1941-2000). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 - Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment: (a) topography, lithology and streams; (b) land-use \n\nin 2009 and location of the study sites. \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nJ F M A M J J A S O N D\n\nM\ne\na\nn\n t\n\ne\nm\n\np\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n (\n\u00b0C\n\n)\n\nR\na\nin\n\nfa\nll\n\n (\nm\n\nm\n)\n\na) \n\nb) \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n47 \n\nThe catchment, totally rural until 1972, underwent discontinuous urbanization in 1973 - \n\n1993, followed by urban consolidation after 1993 (Tavares et al., 2012). The agricultural \n\narea, mainly olives and arable land, declined from 48% in 1958 to 4% of the catchment \n\nin 2009. Woodland increased from 46% to 66% over the same period, changing also in \n\nnature from Quercus suber and mixed woodland to large commercial plantations of pine \n\n(Pinus pinaster) and eucalypt (Eucalyptus globulus) (Tavares et al., 2012). Urban land-\n\nuse increased from 6% in 1958 to 30% in 2009 (Figure 3.2b), of which 14% comprised \n\nimpervious surfaces and 16% urban soil. The result was a mosaic of older urban cores, \n\nwith detached houses and gardens, contrasting with newer apartment blocks. There are \n\nalso a few small industrial premises, recreational areas and an enterprise park begun in \n\n2009. Urban storm runoff (from roofs, streets and concrete paved areas) is either piped to \n\ntributaries or flows directly towards the stream network. Where urban buildings and \n\nderelict urban land are surrounded by fields, however, stormwater is not controlled.  \n\n \n\n3.3. Methodology \n\n3.3.1. Research design \n\nA network of 31 representative sites was established in the catchment to assess \n\nhydrological properties of the six different land-use/lithology combinations or \u201clandscape \n\nunits\u201d (Figure 3.2b). There were: 1) 11 sites in woodland, 9 being on sandstone \n\n(dominated by eucalypt, pine and mixed deciduous forest) and 2 on limestone (in small \n\nareas of oak and mixed deciduous woodland); 2) 11 sites on agricultural fields, including \n\n5 on sandstone (dominated by light grazing pasture, small olive groves and minor \n\ncultivated patches) and 6 on limestone (in olive groves and abandoned fields undergoing \n\nnatural succession); and 3) 9 sites on uncultivated urban soil, 4 on sandstone (bare soil \n\nsites associated with construction and open spaces with ground vegetation between \n\nhouses) and 5 on limestone (derelict spaces between houses and between houses and \n\nroads).  \n\nAt each site, soil moisture content, hydrophobicity and soil matrix infiltration capacity \n\nwere monitored 9 times between September 2010 and June 2011, to cover a representative \n\nrange of antecedent weather and seasonal conditions, including prolonged periods of wet \n\nweather and long dry spells. Temperature and rainfall data during the study period were \n\nprovided by the national meteorological weather station 12G/02UG, located at Bencanta, \n\n0.5 km north of the study catchment.  \n\nReplicate measurements of soil hydrological properties, spaced approximately 1m apart, \n\nwere carried out at each site. In total, 558 measurements of each parameter were obtained. \n\nThree soil samples (c. 100 g each) were collected on the nine occasions at each site to \n\nassess surface soil moisture (0-50 mm depth). Additional soil samples were taken at all \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \u2013 SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF HYDROLOGIC SOIL PROPERTIES \n\nAND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERLAND FLOW AND LAND MANAGEMENT  \n\n \n\n48 \n\nsites on 23rd November 2010 to determine dry bulk density, rock fragment content, \n\norganic matter and particle size distribution. The excavation method (150\u00d7150 m and 100 \n\nmm depth) was used for bulk density and rock fragment analyses (three samples per \n\nlocation) (Dane and Topp, 2002). Composite samples were also collected at depths of 0-\n\n50 m and 50-100 mm for organic matter and particle size distribution analyses. Each \n\ncomposite sample comprised 17 sub-samples collected at 150 mm intervals along a 2.4 \n\nm transect at each site. \n\n \n\n3.3.2. Field methods and procedure \n\nSoil matrix infiltration capacity was measured using a Minidisk Tension Infiltrometer \n\n(Decagon Devices; 45 mm diameter and pressure head of -30 mm). Before measurements, \n\nground vegetation was trimmed and surface litter carefully removed. Following \n\npreliminary trials, measurements were taken over 30 minutes by which time steady-state \n\nconditions were assumed to have been reached. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was \n\ncalculated using published guidelines (Zhang, 1997; Li et al. 2005; Decagon, 2007). \n\nInfiltration capacity, however, was calculated from the final 10 minutes of data (i.e. when \n\nthe values were judged to have stabilized). Taking all measurements as recommended by \n\nDecagon (2007) would have given spurious values due both to initially high infiltration \n\nin hydrophilic soils and to delayed infiltration when soils were hydrophobic. \n\nNear each infiltrometer location, soil hydrophobicity was assessed at depths of 0, 20 and \n\n50 mm using the Molarity of an Ethanol Droplet (MED) technique (Doerr, 1998). Fifteen \n\ndrops of distilled water and then progressively higher concentrations of ethanol were \n\napplied until the lowest concentration was identified at which at least 8 out of 15 drops \n\nwere absorbed within 5 seconds. Ethanol concentrations of 0, 3, 5, 8.5, 13, 18, 24 and 36 \n\npercent by volume were used. The soil was considered wettable (hydrophilic) when \n\ndistilled water drops infiltrated within 5 seconds. The classes of levels of hydrophobicity \n\nused were: low for 3 and 5% ethanol, moderate for 8.5 and 13%, severe for 18 and 24%, \n\nand extreme for 36% (Doerr, 1998). \n\n \n\n3.3.3. Laboratory methods \n\nSoil physical properties (bulk density, rock fragment, organic matter content and particle \n\nsize) were analysed using standard methods (Dane and Topp, 2002). Bulk density was \n\nobtained from undisturbed samples dried at 105\u00b0C. Disturbed soil samples were oven-\n\ndried at 38\u00b0C until a constant weight was reached, and the&lt;2 mm fraction extracted. The \n\n>2 mm rock fragment content was calculated as a percentage of the total dry soil sample \n\nweight. The organic matter content was analyzed by oxidation at 600\u00baC and detected by \n\nclose infra-red, using SC-144DR equipment (Strohlein Instruments). Porosity was \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n49 \n\ncalculated from the dry bulk density and the organic matter content according to methods \n\nrecommended by Dane and Topp (2002), assuming a soil mineral particle density of 2.65 \n\ng cm-3 and organic matter bulk density of 0.90 g cm-3. The particle size distribution of the \n\nminerogenic component of the soil samples was determined where organic matter content \n\nwas > 2% either by: 1) oxidation using hydrogen peroxide (6%), for samples with organic \n\nmatter contents of 2-4%; or 2) heating to 550\u00baC for samples with higher values. The \n\nsamples were then dispersed using Na-hexametaphosphate and the ultrasonic method \n\n(Dane and Topp, 2002). Particle size distribution was subsequently determined using a \n\ncombination of sieving, gravity sedimentation and pipette analysis. Soil texture classes \n\nwere based on the ISSS international classification (Soil Survey Division Staff, 1993).  \n\nSoil moisture content was assessed on each measurement occasion by the \n\nthermogravimetric method following oven-drying at 105\u00baC. Soil saturation was than \n\nestimated by dividing the volumetric water content (estimated from gravimetric water \n\ncontent and bulk density) by porosity. \n\n \n\n3.3.4. Data analysis \n\nThe statistical significance of soil property differences between the land-use/lithology \n\nlandscape units was investigated first using the non-parametric Kruskal\u2013Wallis H test \n\n(SPSS 17.0). Where significant differences between units were identified, the Least \n\nSignificant Difference (LSD) Post-Hoc test was applied to identify distinct units or groups \n\nof units. The same tests and procedure were applied to differences in soil hydrological \n\nproperties between measuring dates. A 95% level of significance (p<0.05) was used. In \n\naddition, Pearson-r correlation coefficients were calculated to assess linear relationships \n\nbetween: 1) soil properties (organic matter content, bulk density and particle size) and \n\nsoil moisture, soil hydrophobicity and infiltration capacity (n=64); and 2) antecedent \n\nweather and soil hydrological properties on each monitoring occasion. Principal \n\nComponent Analysis was used to quantify the infiltration variance explained by the \n\ncorrelated variables. Although the data were not normally distributed, it was considered \n\nuseful to apply this technique for explorative purposes to improve understanding of the \n\ncontrols on overland flow. Spatial patterns of hydrological soil properties were analysed \n\nusing geostatistical methods, based on Thiessen Polygons, carried out using ArcGIS 9.3 \n\nsoftware. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \u2013 SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF HYDROLOGIC SOIL PROPERTIES \n\nAND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERLAND FLOW AND LAND MANAGEMENT  \n\n \n\n50 \n\n3.4. Results and analysis \n\n3.4.1. Soil properties \n\nSoil organic matter was generally higher and more consistent for surface (0-50 mm) than \n\nsubsurface soil (50-100 mm) (Figures 3.3a and 3.3b). For both soil depths, organic matter \n\ncontent increased from urban (1-3%) to agricultural (3-9%) and woodland soils \n\n(averaging 7% and 14% on sandstone and limestone, respectively). In the woodland and \n\nagricultural-limestone landscape units, organic matter was highly variable, but greater \n\nthan in agricultural-sandstone and urban soils (p<0.05). \n\nBulk density increased from woodland (0.7 g cm-3) to agricultural (1.0 g cm-3) and to \n\nurban soils (1.2 g cm-3) (Figure 3.3c). In woodland and urban soils, bulk density was \n\nsimilar on both lithologies (p>0.05), but it was higher for agricultural-sandstone than \n\nagricultural-limestone soils (median values of 1.1 g cm-3 and 0.9 g cm-3) (p<0.05). Values \n\nfor the latter were similar to woodland, whereas agricultural-sandstone values were \n\nsimilar to urban soils (p>0.05). Bulk density decreased as soil organic matter increased \n\n(r=-0.341, p<0.001). \n\nSoil porosity ranged from 40 to 65% (Figure 3.3d) with generally lower values for urban \n\nsoils, despite no significant difference (p>0.05). Greater heterogeneity was found in \n\nagricultural soils, with higher values on limestone than sandstone (p<0.05). Rock \n\nfragment content ranged from 14 to 57% and was similar amongst landscape units \n\n(p>0.05).

At agricultural sites especially on limestone (Figures 3.5c and \n\n3.5d), hydrophobicity was also present in dry periods but was less severe than on \n\nwoodland and rapidly decreased in frequency following rainstorms and disappeared in \n\nwetter periods. Urban soil was mostly hydrophilic (Figures 3.5e and 3.5f), with \n\nhydrophobicity only affecting a minority of sites even in the driest periods. Re-\n\nestablishment of hydrophobic conditions in dry weather also varied with land-use, being \n\nrapid in woodland, particularly on sandstone where it re-appeared by 24 January 2011, \n\nbut far slower on agricultural and urban soils, where it was absent until March 2011. \n\nSignificant differences between woodland and urban soils were found (p<0.05). \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n55 \n\nA positive correlation was identified between hydrophobicity severity and organic matter \n\ncontent (r=0.308 for surface and 0.345 for subsurface soil, p<0.001). Hydrophobicity was \n\ncorrelated with particle size, increasing with surface fine sand (r=0.197, p<0.001) and \n\ndecreasing with subsurface clay fraction (r=-0.226, p<0.001). This was reflected also in \n\na negative correlation with bulk density (r=-0.240, p<0.001). Hydrophobicity was also \n\nfound to be inversely correlated with soil moisture (r=-0.363, p<0.001, n=558). \n\nNevertheless, hydrophilic conditions were recorded at least at some locations in all \n\nagricultural and urban landscape units over the range of soil moisture contents recorded \n\n(see section 3.4.4), whereas in woodland  soil was invariably hydrophobic at contents \n\nbelow 20%. There seemed to be no particular moisture threshold, although at 75% of the \n\nmeasurement sites, at least low hydrophobicity was characteristic below 45% soil \n\nmoisture. Hydrophobicity, however, was recorded at a few woodland sites with 70% soil \n\nmoisture. \n\n \n\n3.4.4. Soil moisture \n\nSurface soil moisture varied with antecedent weather (Figures 2.7 and 2.8), increasing \n\nafter rainfall (although correlations were weak: r=0.375, 0.168, 0.258 and 0.541 with -2, \n\n5-, 10- and 30 day antecedent rainfall, respectively, p<0.001), and declining with higher \n\ntemperature (r=-0.593 with values in previous 5 days, p<0.001). During summer and after \n\nlong rain-free periods (30/09/2010 and 13/06/2011), soil became dry (<20% moisture) \n\nacross the catchment. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7 - Box-plots of soil moisture content for the different landscape units for the study \n\nperiod (W: woodland, A: agricultural, U: urban, S: sandstone, L: limestone).

This was very pronounced on 2nd November 2010 (Figure \n\n3.7). Soil moisture was generally lower in urban sandstone soils throughout the year, but \n\nalso on woodland sandstone in winter and in dry-wet and wet-dry transition periods. \n\nIndeed, the lowest post-summer (30/09/2010) median soil moisture content was recorded \n\nin woodland sandstone areas, where it persisted until late autumn (23/11/2010). \n\nConversely, agricultural and urban limestone soils generally exhibited higher moisture \n\ncontents, especially in the wettest periods, when soil saturation occurred at a few valley-\n\nfloor sites near streams (Figure 3.8). Nevertheless, the locations and sizes of wettest areas \n\nin Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es changed through time, and high soil moisture values were recorded \n\noccasionally at a minority of woodland sandstone sites in winter. In general, soil moisture \n\ncontent increased with greater silt (r=0.220, p<0.001) and clay (r= 0.163, p<0.001) \n\nfractions. \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n57 \n\n3.4.5. Infiltration capacity \n\nSoil matrix infiltration capacity in the Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment was generally low, \n\ndespite occasional higher values (Figures 3.9 and 3.10). In general, sandstone soils \n\nrecorded greater permeability than limestone soils. Land-use also affected infiltration \n\ncapacity but differences varied with season and weather (Figure 3.9). Generally, \n\nwoodland recorded higher values in wet than dry periods (p<0.05), with median values \n\nincreasing from 0.1 - 0.2 mm h-1 on 13/06/2011 and 30/09/2010 to 2.8 mm h-1 on \n\n03/01/2010. Nevertheless, after the summer, higher infiltration capacity in woodland \n\noccurred earlier on limestone than sandstone. Urban soils showed the opposite trend \n\n(p<0.05), with median infiltration capacity diminishing from 2.6 mm h-1 on 13/06/2011 \n\nand 3.1 mm h-1  on 30/09/2010 to 1.4 mm h-1 on 03/01/2010, with slightly higher values \n\non sandstone than on limestone. In agricultural areas, the fall in median infiltration \n\ncapacity (from 2.5 mm h-1 on 30/09/2010 to 0.8 mm h-1 on 03/01/2010) was not \n\nstatistically significant. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \u2013 SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF HYDROLOGIC SOIL PROPERTIES \n\nAND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERLAND FLOW AND LAND MANAGEMENT  \n\n \n\n58 \n\n   a)                                                                 b) \n\n \nc)                                                                   d) \n\n \n   e)                                                                 f) \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9 - Box plots of temporal variability of matrix soil infiltration capacity for each \n\nlandscape unit.

Discussion \n\n3.5.1. Characteristics of the landscape units and their influence on \n\noverland flow \n\n3.5.1.1. Woodland  \n\nWoodland environments showed the highest soil organic matter content over the \n\ncatchment. The high variability of this soil property within woodland areas may be due \n\nto differences in tree species and management practices, affecting the litter layer \n\nthickness. The lower organic matter of eucalypt than other woodlands may reflect (a) \n\nperiodic understorey clearance to help prevent wildfires and (b) low understorey \n\nvegetation caused by reduced water availability (DeBano, 2000). The generally low \n\nvalues of soil bulk density in woodland units may be the outcome of higher organic matter \n\nin woodland soils than in soils of the other landscape units and the denser root systems \n\nassociated with a tree cover. Reduced bulk density is also characteristic of soils with \n\ngreater organic matter, since it helps the formation of soil aggregates and structure (Celik \n\net al., 2010).  \n\n The greatest soil hydrophobicity of woodland units can be linked to the species involved \n\nand their organic matter produced. Seasonal changes in hydrophobicity, with high values \n\nin summer and considerable disappearance in winter, was more pronounced in woodland \n\nthan other landscape units and is in accordance with previous studies (e.g. Dekker and \n\nRitsema, 1994; Doerr et al., 2000; Mart\u00ednez-Zavala and Jord\u00e1n-L\u00f3pez, 2009). Within \n\nwoodland, however, hydrophobicity was more extensive, severe and persistent in sites \n\noverlying sandstone than limestone (Figures 3.5a and 3.5b). Thus, in woodland-sandstone \n\nareas a larger number of rainfall events were required for the soil to become hydrophilic, \n\nand even during the wettest periods, hydrophobicity persisted in a few soil sites. This is \n\nprobably because sandstone areas were mainly dominated by eucalypt and pine \n\nplantations, whereas on limestone, oak is more dominant.   The type of resins, waxes and \n\naromatic oils produced by eucalypt (Doerr et al., 1998; Jord\u00e1n et al., 2008) is thought to \n\nhave caused hydrophobicity to be more extensive and resistant than in the other woodland \n\nstands, with hydrophobicity in eucalypt stands able to persist following rainfall of as \n\nmuch as 200 mm in 2 months (Ferreira, 1996; Doerr and Thomas, 2000). In contrast, in \n\nwoodland-limestone areas, hydrophobicity was less severe and easier to switch to \n\nhydrophilic conditions because oak, which is not usually associated with hydrophobic \n\nsoil (Zavala et al., 2009), is the dominant vegetation.  \n\nGenerally, woodland areas were also characterized by a quicker re-establishment of \n\nhydrophobic conditions after rainfall events, comparing with the other landscape units, \n\nparticularly under eucalypt plantations. The rate of re-establishment would depend on the \n\nbiological productivity of the ecosystem (Doerr and Thomas, 2000; Hardie et al., 2012), \n\nthe type of hydrocarbon substances produced and microbial activity (Keizer et al., 2008). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \u2013 SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF HYDROLOGIC SOIL PROPERTIES \n\nAND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERLAND FLOW AND LAND MANAGEMENT  \n\n \n\n62 \n\nSantos et al. (2013) report greater dynamism and more frequent hydrophobic conditions \n\nin eucalypt than in pine.  \n\nNevertheless, differences in hydrophibicity between sandstone and limestone, may also \n\nbe linked to differences in particle size, given the statistically significant (albeit weak) \n\npositive correlation found between hydrophobicity and sand-fraction. This correlation has \n\nalso been recorded elsewhere (e.g. DeBano, 1991; McKissock et al., 2000), although a \n\nfew studies have reported hydrophobicity in finer-textured soils (e.g. Doerr and Thomas, \n\n2000).  \n\nThe higher evapotranspiration associated with a forest cover (e.g. Holden, 2008) may \n\nexplain the low soil moisture contents recorded during dry periods in woodland, \n\ncompared with in the other land-uses (Figure 3.7), although shading by ground vegetation \n\nand litter  can reduce soil moisture loss in warm, sunny conditions. The more intense \n\nhydrophobic conditions in eucalypt and pine woodland, by hindering infiltration (Dekker \n\nand Ritsema, 1994; Doerr and Thomas, 2000), might also help to explain the lower soil \n\nmoisture results recorded in woodland-sandstone compared with limestone  at times of \n\ntransition from dry to wet conditions (15/10/2010 and 02/11/2011).   \n\nDespite the inverse correlation found between hydrophobicity and soil moisture content \n\nin the woodland units, no soil moisture threshold seems to determine the switching pattern \n\nbetween hydrophobic and hydrophilic soil properties. This accords with the inconsistent \n\nresults recorded elsewhere. Thus in field experiments in Portugal, Leighton-Boyce et al. \n\n(2005) reported no threshold for up to 50% soil moisture content, whereas Doerr and \n\nThomas (2000) found one at 28%. Reports of thresholds outside Portugal vary from 21% \n\nfor medium-textured soils in SE Spain (Soto et al., 1994), to 38% for Dutch clayey peats \n\n(Dekker and Ritsema, 1994) and 50% for some organic-rich Swedish soils (Berglund and \n\nPersson, 1996). \n\nThe seasonal changes in hydrophobicity of woodland areas would explain seasonal \n\ncontrast in infiltration capacity. Thus, under driest conditions, when hydrophobicity is \n\nwidespread on woodland soil, measured infiltration capacity was minimal, whereas in \n\nwettest conditions, the limited spatial extent of hydrophobicity allowed infiltration \n\ncapacity of woodland sites to attain the highest values within Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es. \n\nNevertheless, the low inverse correlation coefficient found between infiltration capacity \n\nand hydrophobicity, despite being statistically significant, may have arisen because \n\ninfiltration may sometimes have been delayed by repellency, but on other occasions have \n\ncommenced with switching to hydrophilic conditions by the end of the final 10 minutes \n\nof the 30 minutes measurement period.  \n\nOrganic matter arguably plays a dual role in explaining seasonal contrast in infiltration \n\ncapacity in woodland units. Thus, although it is associated with hydrophobic conditions \n\nand low infiltration capacities in dry and transitional weather, in wet periods in winter, \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n63 \n\nwhen hydrophobicity has largely disappeared, the same high levels of organic matter \n\npromote structured soils of high matrix infiltration capacity, representing the more typical \n\nsituation of forest soils (e.g. Costa, 1999; Mouri et al., 2011).  \n\nThe variations in hydrophobicity, soil moisture and infiltration capacity linked to \n\ngeological and land-use controls and seasonal climatic influences, discussed above, result \n\nin spatio-temporal patterns of overland flow that differ seasonally and between woodland-\n\nsandstone and woodland-limestone areas.  In storms following summer dry periods (e.g. \n\nfollowing 30/09/2010 and 13/06/2010), drought-induced hydrophobicity in eucalypt and \n\npine areas and resultant very low matrix infiltration capacity makes the woodland-\n\nsandstone areas particularly susceptible to infiltration-excess overland flow generation. \n\nThe less hydrophobic nature of the predominantly oak vegetation of woodland-limestone \n\nareas means that they are less prone to infiltration-excess overland flow.  Prolonged or \n\nrepeated rainfall events lead to partial switching of woodland soils to a hydrophilic state, \n\nand reductions in spatial extent and severity of hydrophobicity. Hydrophobicity in \n\neucalypt stands is more resistant to break down, requiring longer and/or a greater number \n\nof rainfall events. Because of this, infiltration capacity generally remained low in \n\nwoodland sandstone areas (Figure 3.9a) and, therefore, prone to generate overland flow \n\nduring transitions from dry to wet conditions, as recorded on 15th October 2010.  In \n\nprolonged wet weather of the winter wet season, hydrophobicity largely disappeared even \n\nin woodland-sandstone areas, where no infiltration-excess overland flow occurred. Even \n\nunder the wettest winter conditions, woodland areas showed relatively low soil moisture \n\nand high infiltration capacities, thus saturation overland flow was rare.  \n\nThe potential for infiltration-excess overland flow in woodland landscape units in dry \n\nsummer conditions was confirmed by rainfall simulation experiments, when a 43 mm h-1 \n\nsimulated rainfall  produced runoff coefficients of  20-83%  in a small plot (0.25 m2), \n\nunder extremely hydrophobic woodland soils (slope: 5-36\u00ba)  (Ferreira et al., 2012b). \n\nUnder natural rainfall in larger runoff plots (16 m2) in woodland, however, under \n\nextremely hydrophobic conditions, overland flow did not exceed 3% even for a 23 mm \n\nrainfall event (Ferreira et al., 2012a), mainly because of infiltration bypassing the \n\nhydrophobic soil matrix via macropores that can be provided by root-holes, invertebrate \n\nactivity and high concentrations of stones (e.g. Urbanek and Shakesby, 2009; Hardie et \n\nal., 2011),  Such bypass (preferential) flow is viewed as an important mechanism not only \n\nin extremely hydrophobic soils (Doerr and Thomas, 2000), but also in dry loamy soils \n\nwith high clay and silt contents (Yang and Zhang, 2011; Bracken and Croke, 2007). \n\nCracks in clay soils were observed in dry conditions during fieldwork in the catchment \n\nstudy.  \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \u2013 SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF HYDROLOGIC SOIL PROPERTIES \n\nAND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERLAND FLOW AND LAND MANAGEMENT  \n\n \n\n64 \n\n3.5.1.2. Urban  \n\nIn contrast to woodland areas, urban landscape units in the Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment \n\nare characterized by lowest soil organic matter content. This is probably linked to the \n\nreduced and patchy vegetation cover and, in some locations, either loss or deposition of \n\nsurface soil. The higher bulk density may be largely due to compaction by people and \n\nvehicles (Silva et al., 1997), as a result of vehicle access and parking in the discontinuous \n\nurban fabric. Soil bulk densities measured (1.07-1.72 g cm-3) were similar to those  \n\nreported in Nanjing, China, where lowest values were recorded in greenbelt areas and \n\nmaximum ones in parking zones (1.19-1.62 g cm-3) (Yang and Zhang, 2011).  \n\nIn the Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment, the dominance of bare surfaces and sparse grass \n\nand shrub vegetation is the main cause of the recorded widespread hydrophilic conditions \n\nthroughout the year. Only at particularly well vegetated sites was hydrophobicity \n\nrecorded during the driest periods. Bare soil sites, mainly found on sandstone, being more \n\nsusceptible to evaporation (Nunes et al., 2011), may have led to the low soil moisture \n\ncontent recorded  particular in dry-wet transitional periods, such as in the southwest of \n\nthe catchment  on 02/11/2010 and 21/03/2011 (Figure 3.8).   \n\nThe generally hydrophilic conditions found in urban soil would help to explain the high \n\nsoil matrix infiltration capacity values recorded particularly after prolonged dry weathers \n\n(Figure 3.9), despite the  high bulk density, which elsewhere has been noted to be \n\nassociated with lower infiltration capacities  (e.g. Dornauf and Burghardt, 2000; Yang \n\nand Zhang, 2011).  The very low and in some cases zero values of soil matrix infiltration \n\ncapacity  recorded  during wet periods may be linked to a decline in the suction force and \n\nthen saturation of the soil. The inverse correlation recorded between soil moisture and \n\ninfiltration capacity was also found in Tasmania, Australia, where the application of dye \n\ntracer showed infiltration to an average depth of 1.03 m (with a wetting front velocity of \n\n1160 mm h-1) in low antecedent soil moisture conditions, compared with a depth of 0.35 m \n\n(and a wetting front velocity of 120 mm h-1) with wet antecedent conditions (Hardie et \n\nal., 2012). \n\nIn urban landscape units, overland flow is readily generated on paved and tarmac \n\nimpervious surfaces, but for urban soils it varies in importance both seasonally and \n\nbetween urban-sandstone and urban-limestone areas. In dry summer conditions, the \n\ngenerally hydrophilic soils of greater infiltration capacity (Figures 3.9 and 3.10) lead to \n\nlittle or no overland flow and make these areas overland flow sinks.  In contrast, after \n\nlarger winter storm events, soil saturation or near-saturation was identified at urban-\n\nlimestone sites (Figures 3.7 and 3.8), associated with a near-surface water table (on the \n\nvalley floor) and shallow soils of low water storage capacity (on hillslopes). In both \n\nsituations saturation overland flow was at least locally being generated. In contrast, in \n\nurban soils on sandstone, soil moisture levels recorded in winter were much lower than \n\non limestone (Figure 3.7) and infiltration capacities (Figure 3.9) varied from low (on bare \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n65 \n\nsoil) to relatively high (on uncompacted, vegetated sites); the result was patchy Hortonian \n\noverland flow, mostly on the bare soil areas, with some of the vegetated patches acting as \n\noverland flow sinks.   \n\nThe potential for  overland flow generation in urban soils was demonstrated by runoff \n\ncoefficients of 59-99% recorded on hydrophilic urban soils (slope: 6-30\u00ba) in 43 mm h-1 \n\nrainfall simulations on small plots (0.25 m2) at the field sites, though it was unclear \n\nwhether the overland flow was infiltration-excess or saturation in nature (Ferreira et al., \n\n2012b). \n\n \n\n3.5.1.3. Agriculture  \n\nIn agricultural landscape units, different land-use/land management types lead to major \n\ndifferences on surface cover and soil properties. The agricultural types on sandstone \n\n(mainly pasture, small gardens and olive plantations) may explain the low organic matter \n\ncontent and high bulk density results of that landscape unit compared with the \n\nagricultural-limestone unit, where abandoned fields undergoing natural vegetation \n\nsuccession are dominant. This greater vegetation cover with higher soil organic matter \n\ncontent for agricultural-limestone would also explain the unit\u2019s enhanced spatial extent \n\nand severity than on sandstone. Nevertheless, hydrophobicity at agricultural-limestone \n\nsites was less severe than in woodland, and fewer rainfall events were required to \n\naccomplish switching from hydrophobic to hydrophilic conditions and hydrophobicity re-\n\nestablishment in wet to dry transitions was also slower than for woodland (Figure 3.5). In \n\na previous study of a partly urbanized Mediterranean catchment, Fern\u00e1ndez and Ceballos \n\n(2003) only recorded lower hydrophobicity persistence when conditions were changing \n\nfrom dry to wet. \n\n The generally greater soil moisture values of agricultural compared with other landscape \n\nunits, despite the absence of irrigation, may be explained by the lower vegetation cover \n\nof the agricultural-limestone sites and the low hydrophobicity, particularly when \n\ncompared with woodland. In addition, high surface roughness associated with tillage in \n\nagricultural-sandstone fields may enhance surface water retention and lead to higher soil \n\nmoisture (\u00c1lvarez-Mozos et al., 2009), especially when compared with untilled urban \n\nsoils.  \n\nSoil moisture, however, was slightly higher at agricultural-limestone than agricultural-\n\nsandstone sites, despite most of the former being abandoned. This may be a consequence \n\nof the marly nature of the limestone, which leads to greater fractions of fine material. \n\nHowever, the small soil moisture difference may reflect the fact that most sandstone \n\nagricultural sites are on valley floors (Figure 8), whereas limestone sites are mainly on \n\nupper slopes, where the soil is shallow (generally&lt;0.4 mm depth), though in the wettest \n\nperiods some saturation was observed here.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \u2013 SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF HYDROLOGIC SOIL PROPERTIES \n\nAND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERLAND FLOW AND LAND MANAGEMENT  \n\n \n\n66 \n\nDifferences in particle size distribution and land management practices, particularly \n\nwheeling, may explain higher soil porosity on abandoned limestone than on ploughed \n\nsandstone fields. Nevertheless, coarser particle size distribution and minor \n\nhydrophobicity may explain greater soil matrix infiltration capacity on sandstone \n\ncompared with limestone agricultural areas in dry periods.  \n\nHowever, rising soil moisture content through the wet season, could restrict soil matrix \n\ninfiltration capacity over agricultural areas, mostly noticed on sandstone fields. In \n\nagricultural-limestone sites, matrix infiltration capacity was relatively constant over the \n\nyear. In this landscape unit, the slight infiltration capacity increase during early autumn, \n\npossibly due to soil hydrophobicity shrinkage, gives place to a decreasing capacity in later \n\nautumn and winter seasons, as a result of soil moisture increase. Throughout spring, with \n\nsoil moisture decrease, infiltration capacity tend to increase, but possibly with \n\nhydrophobicity re-emergence, infiltration capacity was limited again. The development \n\nof hydrophobic conditions in the agricultural soils was clearly slower than woodland \n\n(Figure 3.5).  \n\nOverland flow generation, in response to the contrasts in soil moisture, hydrophobicity \n\nand infiltration capacity and their seasonal dynamics discussed above, differed between \n\nthe agricultural-sandstone and agricultural-limestone landscape units.  In agricultural-\n\nsandstone areas, high infiltration capacities associated with hydrophilic soils throughout \n\nthe year and with sandy particle size meant that overland flow was absent in summer and \n\nin winter was only generated in big events or following very wet weather.  In contrast, \n\nthe greater vegetation of the abandoned fields on limestone led to hydrophobic soils in \n\nsummer and a degree of proneness to infiltration-excess overland flow. Despite partial \n\nswitching in transition periods and total switching to hydrophilic conditions in winter wet \n\nperiods, the relatively low infiltration capacities and high soil moisture resulting from the \n\nmarly limestone lithology meant that the agricultural limestone areas were more prone in \n\nwinter to saturation overland flow than the sandstone areas. Unlike on urban and \n\nwoodland soil sites, no infiltration-excess overland flow  was recorded in 43 mm h-1 \n\nrainfall simulation experiments  on hydrophilic agricultural land (slope 15-50\u00ba) in the \n\nstudy area (Ferreira et al., 2012b). \n\n \n\n3.5.1.4. Synthesis: the influences of lithology, topography and land-use \n\nfactors on overland flow and temporal variation in its distribution within the \n\nRibeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment \n\nLithology seems to play an important role in controlling spatio-temporal dynamics of \n\noverland flow in the Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment via its influence on particle size \n\ndistribution, soil moisture and infiltration capacity variability over the catchment. \n\nGenerally, the greater sand fractions and deeper soils of the sandstone areas promote \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n67 \n\ngreater infiltration capacity and water storage capacity, as well as lower soil moisture, \n\nleading to reduced proneness to both Hortonian and saturation overland flow. In contrast, \n\nthe higher silt-clay content and shallower nature of soils on the marly limestone result in \n\ngreater soil moisture, lower infiltration and water storage capacities and hence greater \n\nproneness to saturation overland flow than on sandstone. These are in line with reports \n\nelsewhere of the influence of shallow soils (Easton et al., 2007, Hardie et al., 2011) and \n\nvariations in particle size (Rahardjo et al., 2008; Yang and Zhang, 2011) on overland \n\nflow.  \n\nSecondly local topographic characteristics also seem to be an important driver. Saturation \n\nwas observed at urban soil sites near streams (Figure 3.8) caused either by (1) lateral \n\nsubsurface flows from upslope (Aryal et al., 2005) or (2) groundwater table rise, as \n\nrecorded at a woodland-sandstone site near to an active spring on 24th January 2011 \n\n(Figure 3.8). In a small cultivated Mediterranean catchment, Latron and Gallart (2007), \n\nalso explained the saturation pattern with extent and height of the water table. The \n\nlocations and extents of the wettest areas in the Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment varied \n\ntemporally, a feature also reported elsewhere within agricultural hillslope (Walter et al., \n\n2000) and mixed agricultural and forested areas (Easton et al., 2007). \n\nLand-use and land management constitutes the third and perhaps most important \n\ninfluence on differences in overland flow between and within landscape units. This \n\ninfluence is exerted through the effects of different percentage ground covers, \n\nmanagement practices and other human activities on degrees of soil compaction, soil \n\nmoisture levels and soil permeability and via the effects of different plant species on \n\nhydrophobicity severity, switching dynamics and seasonality. Overland flow is \n\nconsequently of greatest significance in urban landscape units, particularly in winter, \n\nwhen urban soils are often either saturated or bare and compacted, whereas in summer \n\noverland flow from impervious or bare areas is reduced by hydrophilic soil patches. \n\nOverland flow in the woodland units is in general greatly reduced by vegetation effects \n\non infiltration, but is seasonally enhanced in storms following summer dry periods in \n\neucalypt and pine woodland-sandstone areas because of their severe soil hydrophobicity, \n\nbut absent in woodland-limestone areas because of the oak woodland land-use. The \n\nagricultural-sandstone landscape unit produces very little overland flow because of high \n\ninfiltration capacities resulting from a combination of land-use and land management \n\npractices that do not result in compaction, but mostly because of the sandy soils. In \n\nconverse fashion, the abandoned field land-use of agricultural-limestone areas probably \n\nhas the effect of reducing overland flow responses from what they would otherwise be \n\nwith active cultivation, but which for lithology-related reasons can be significant \n\nparticularly in winter wet weather.    \n\nDifferences in temporal variability of soil hydrological properties between landscape \n\nunits led to spatial fluctuation in overland flow sources and sinks. In wet winter \n\nconditions, overland flow is greatest from the urban landscape units and also significant \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \u2013 SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF HYDROLOGIC SOIL PROPERTIES \n\nAND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERLAND FLOW AND LAND MANAGEMENT  \n\n \n\n68 \n\nfrom the agricultural-limestone unit, but comparatively little from the hydrophilic and \n\npermeable agricultural-sandstone and woodland units except in the wettest weather. \n\nDuring transitions from wettest to dry conditions, the spatial pattern of response to \n\nrainstorms is reversed, with decreasing susceptibility to saturation overland flow as soil \n\nmoisture declined (mainly associated with agricultural- and urban-limestone areas) and \n\nincreasing vulnerability to infiltration-excess overland flow, enhanced by hydrophobicity \n\nre-establishment (particularly in woodland but also on agricultural-limestone). In \n\nsummer, overland flow is comparatively low but still greatest in urban-limestone areas \n\nand to a lesser extent is also significant in the woodland and agricultural-limestone units \n\nbecause of their hydrophobic condition, but urban-sandstone and agricultural-sandstone \n\nareas produce comparatively little overland flow, because of locally or more widespread \n\nhydrophilic and permeable surface soils providing overland flow sinks.  Finally, in the \n\ndry to wet transition of autumn, patterns of overland flow are broadly similar to the wet-\n\nto-dry transition, with hydrophobicity (and overland flow responses) becoming most \n\nrapidly re-established in eucalypt parts of the woodland-sandstone landscape unit.      \n\nSpatial variability of soil properties within the same landscape unit, such as particle size \n\nand hydrophobicity, provides heterogeneous infiltration capacities, where this \n\nparticularly applies to the partly bare urban-sandstone unit and woodland and \n\nagricultural-limestone units in transitional periods (Figure 3.9). Soil spots with matrix \n\ninfiltration capacity lower than rainfall intensity will lead to infiltration-excess overland \n\nflow, which may be infiltrated in surrounding soil spots with greater infiltration capacity.  \n\nNot all the landscape units provided spots with sufficient permeability throughout the \n\nyear. Urban and agricultural landscape units showed more sites of high permeability after \n\ndry periods, while even in wettest conditions, woodland provided sites of high infiltration \n\ncapacity.  Nevertheless, even the most permeable soil patches could not cope with the \n\nmaximum rainfall intensity of 15.6 mm h-1 recorded in the rainstorm of 2nd November \n\n2011. Thus infiltration-excess overland flow would be expected to occur widely during \n\nparticularly intense storms in all landscape units. \n\n \n\n3.5.2. Implications for catchment runoff delivery and land \n\nmanagement \n\nThe changing nature of overland flow sources and sinks within the catchment can be \n\nexpected to affect flow connectivity over the hillslope and influence storm runoff delivery \n\nto the stream network. Under hydrophobic conditions, infiltration-excess overland flow \n\ngenerated in relatively extensive woodland on steep slopes and on shallow upstream \n\nagricultural-limestone soils, may reach the stream network directly or be delivered to the \n\nurban cores situated downslope (Figure 3.2b). \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n69 \n\nVegetation is widely considered as a key factor interrupting hydrological connectivity \n\n(e.g. Bracken and Croke, 2007; Appels et al., 2011). Greater vegetation interception \n\nprovided by woodland and agricultural-limestone areas, compared with the other land-\n\nuses, tends to reduce overland flow, though the effect will be marginal in large storm \n\nevents, when percentage interception is small. The more important effect of interception \n\nis in helping (together with transpiration) to reduce antecedent soil moisture levels prior \n\nto rainfall events. In central Portugal, Valente et al. (1997) reported relatively high \n\ninterception losses of 17% in Pinus pinaster forest and 11% in eucalypt stands and \n\nattributed them to the  greater canopy storage and,  aerodynamic roughness (and hence \n\nhigher evaporation rates) of forest covers. In addition, greater litter density and frequency \n\nof root holes compared with the other landscape units may lead to enhanced water \n\ninterception, retention and infiltration, particularly in smaller storm events after dry \n\nspells. Surface roughness also enhances water retention and reduces overland flow rates, \n\nand promotes discontinuities between overland flow source areas (Rodr\u00edguez-Caballero \n\net al., 2012). These infiltration/retention processes operating at larger scales, as well as \n\npreferential flow via root-holes and cracks, considerably reduce the risk that overland \n\nflow from low permeable soil sites might reach downslope contiguous urban areas and/or \n\nthe stream network. Although urban soils may provide overland flow sinks, the \n\nimpermeable tarmac and paved surfaces allow little infiltration, restricting the capacity \n\nof these areas to deal with rainfall and overland flow from upslope landscape units. \n\nObservations in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es over three years suggest that only small amounts of \n\noverland flow were generated in woodland and agricultural limestone areas, mainly after \n\ndry conditions. Nevertheless, preferential flow via macropores can reach streams \n\nrelatively quickly and thus contribute to the flood peak, as reported in other areas of the \n\nworld (Uchida et al., 1999; van Schaik et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2014).   \n\nAlthough not recorded during this study, clear-felling in woodland would cause increased \n\noverland flow and water connectivity by providing bare, compacted areas and reducing \n\ninterception, transpiration and surface roughness. Thus the size and location of clear-\n\nfelled areas require planning to ensure that most overland flow is intercepted by \n\ndownslope woodland area sinks in order to reduce flood hazard. Clear-felling should also \n\nbe timed to avoid storms of early autumn rainy seasons, in view of the greater extent and \n\nlocation of hydrophobic areas at that time (Figure 3.6). In addition, if forest managers \n\nselect tree species that release less hydrophobic substances, overland flow may be \n\ncorrespondingly reduced (e.g. Ferreira et al., 2012a).  \n\nUnder wet winter conditions, saturation overland flow becomes more likely in urban and \n\nagricultural land-uses, but saturated areas may be more influenced by topography and soil \n\ndepth than by land-use (Figure 3.8). Overland flow generated in these landscape units \n\nwould be delivered mostly to the stream network, but also to downslope woodland and \n\nurban cores in the case of upslope saturated shallow soils (Figures 3.2b and 3.8). Previous \n\nstudies reported higher runoff coefficients in shallow soils affecting hillslope runoff \n\nconnectivity (Kirkby et al., 2002; Easton et al., 2007; Hopp and McDonnell, 2009). In \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \u2013 SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF HYDROLOGIC SOIL PROPERTIES \n\nAND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERLAND FLOW AND LAND MANAGEMENT  \n\n \n\n70 \n\nagricultural areas, however, overland flow paths would depend on land management. \n\nLand drains, ditches, wheel ruts and roads may enhance flow connectivity, particularly if \n\nthey are aligned downslope, whereas terracing and stone boundary walls can form traps \n\nfor water, enhancing infiltration and disrupting flow pathways. Overland flow transfer \n\nfrom agricultural and urban areas to downslope woodland soils when hydrophilic may be \n\ndissipated by enhanced infiltration and surface retention. Furthermore, although much of \n\nthe overland flow from impermeable urban surfaces located in upslope positions (Figure \n\n3.2b) is collected by the urban drainage system and delivered directly into the stream, \n\nsome reaches nearby soil. \n\nBecause of the generally low infiltration capacity or saturated condition of downslope \n\nurban soil areas, saturation overland flow reaching such areas may be problematic, \n\nalthough this can be offset by spatial differences in modified and unmodified soil \n\nproperties providing a mosaic of different infiltration capacities. Even if urban soils \n\nsurrounding impermeable surfaces (e.g. roofs and roads) cannot act as sinks, obstructions \n\n(such as buildings and walls) may delay overland flow transfer. This will depend on \n\nurbanization style, since extended impermeable surfaces will enhance landscape \n\nconnectivity, whereas detached houses surrounded by gardens and walls can provide \n\nsinks and flow discontinuity.  \n\nThe susceptibility of urban core areas located in topographic lows (Figure 3.2b) to \n\nsaturation overland flow and stream flooding may represent a real flood hazard for the \n\ninhabitants, particularly considering the scale of recent urban consolidation in the Ribeira \n\ndos Cov\u00f5es catchment. This risk may be enhanced by 1) additional overland flow \n\nresulting from greater connectivity with upslope areas subject to soil moisture increase \n\nand water table rise, and 2) the rapid transfer of most overland flow from upslope \n\nimpermeable surfaces directly into the stream via the urban drainage system. These may \n\nbe particularly important in larger storm events, considering the generally low soil \n\npermeability across the catchment. According to interviews with older citizens, flooding \n\nevents were already experienced about 80, 50 and 10 years ago, when the urban area was \n\nconsiderably less extensive than now. \n\nAnalyses of storm hydrographs of the outlet stream (results not shown) suggest that the \n\nactual landscape mosaic of Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment, comprising extensive \n\nwoodland areas and large urban areas near the catchment outlet, together with numerous \n\nsmaller urban areas mainly along ridges and dispersed agricultural fields (Figure 3.2b), \n\nmay be sufficient to promote discontinuities to the infiltration-excess overland flow \n\ngenerated by soil hydrophobicity. Thus, in dry settings, rainstorms of 2.8 mm (average) \n\nand 14.4 mm (large), recorded on 6th August and 1st September 2011, promoted runoff \n\ncoefficients for the Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es stream of only 5% and 2% respectively and peak \n\nstreamflows of only 0.041 mm h-1 and 0.036 mm h-1, compared with maximum 5-minute \n\nrainfall intensities of 2.4 mm h-1 and 9.6 mm h-1 respectively. Thus, hydrophobicity over \n\nthe catchment does not translate into catchment-scale overland flow, presumably due to \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     \n\n \n\n71 \n\ninfiltration into sinks downslope. In wet conditions, however, enhanced soil moisture \n\nlevels seem to increase flow connectivity over the catchment. Thus rainstorms of 2.8 mm \n\nand 15.0 mm registered on 11th February and 28th March 2011, led to 10% and 9% storm \n\nrunoff coefficients and peak flows of 0.079 and 0.370 mm h-1, compared with maximum \n\nrainfall intensities of 9.6 mm h-1 in both cases. Although lag times from peak rainfall to \n\npeak streamflow are short, ranging between 25 and 35 minutes, and probably a direct \n\nresult of urban surface runoff and the urban drainage system, the overriding feature is the \n\nsmall size of the storm runoff coefficients both during dry and wet times of the year, \n\nwhich shows how little of the rain falling on the peri-urban mosaic actually reaches the \n\nstream network. This may reflect in part the ridge location of much of the urban expansion \n\nto date and in part a rather high proportion of infiltration into urban soil within the urban \n\nunits and adjacent landscape units.  \n\nThe short lag times between rainfall and streamflow peaks in urban areas, however, mean \n\nthat future urban consolidation and the construction of new urban cores, already proposed, \n\nmust be planned carefully in order to minimize urban flood hazard. From the hydrological \n\npoint of view, instead of extending the existing urban cores, it would be better to establish \n\nnew dispersed urban cores far from the stream network. The maintenance of a patchy \n\nmosaic of dispersed landscape units would reduce overland flow and river flood peak \n\nresponses. \n\n \n\n3.6. Conclusions \n\nThe peri-urban Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment is covered by soils of relatively low matrix \n\ninfiltration capacity, but of greater permeability on sandstone than limestone, due to the \n\nmarly nature of the latter. The different landscape units, associated with different land-\n\nuses and lithologies, display varying responses of soil hydrological properties to season \n\nand to antecedent rainfall with complex consequences for spatial patterns of overland \n\nflow and its flow connectivity. The main findings are: \n\n1. In dry conditions, severe hydrophobicity in eucalypt and pine (but not oak) \n\nwoodland and limestone-agricultural areas (abandoned fields) considerably reduces \n\nsoil matrix infiltration capacity. In contrast, agricultural-sandstone soils (mainly \n\ncovered by olives, pasture and gardens) and urban soils remain mostly hydrophilic, \n\nand have relatively high infiltration capacities. Under wet conditions, hydrophobicity \n\nin woodland and agricultural-limestone areas breaks down and infiltration capacity \n\nincreases, reaching 6 mm h-1. In contrast, on urban and agricultural sites, a rise in soil \n\nmoisture leads to a decline in infiltration capacity, with soil saturation in areas of \n\nshallow soils and high water tables on hillslopes, in topographic lows and in valley \n\nbottoms.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \u2013 SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF HYDROLOGIC SOIL PROPERTIES \n\nAND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERLAND FLOW AND LAND MANAGEMENT  \n\n \n\n72 \n\n2. Temporal variability of soil hydrological properties indicates that, in dry conditions, \n\nhydrophobicity-related infiltration-excess overland flow may be generated in \n\nwoodland and agricultural-limestone areas, while in wet conditions saturation is likely \n\nin some locations on urban and agricultural soils. Nevertheless, soil property \n\nheterogeneity and the distinct temporal pattern of infiltration capacity indicate that \n\nmuch overland flow must be infiltrating before reaching the stream network in patches \n\nof unsaturated soil of relatively high permeability, either within the same landscape \n\nunit or on adjacent landscape units. \n\n3. Despite the generally low soil matrix infiltration capacity across the catchment, \n\nmacropores, vegetation, litter and surface roughness play important roles in surface \n\nwater retention and facilitating infiltration. Nevertheless, these processes are \n\ninfluenced by the different landscape units, which provide overland flow sinks with \n\ndiffering temporal regimes. Because of this, a patchy mosaic comprising fragmented \n\nand dispersed land-uses, and the tendency for much of recent urbanization to have \n\noccurred along ridges, have to date led to relatively low flow connectivity over \n\nhillslopes, thereby attenuating river discharge peaks.  \n\nUnderstanding how the spatial and temporal variability in overland flow generation and \n\ninfiltration affect flow connectivity in a catchment with varied land-use, geology and soils \n\nis vital for predicting flood hazards. Landscape managers and urban planners should \n\nemploy a mosaic of different land-uses, where impermeable surfaces are joined \n\nhydrologically to infiltration-promoting \u201cgreen\u201d areas, in order to prevent or reduce \n\ndownstream flooding. There need to be informed decisions about the precise spatial \n\narrangement of different land-uses. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  \n\n \n\n73 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 4  \n\nDIFFERENCES IN OVERLAND FLOW DYNAMICS IN \n\nDIFFERENT TYPES OF WOODLAND AREAS WITHIN A \n\nPERI-URBAN CATCHMENT  \n\n4.1.

This chapter investigates overland flow generation processes in three \n\ndifferent types of hardwood stand in a small (6.2 km2) catchment in central Portugal \n\nthat has undergone strong urban development over the past 50 years. Two eucalypt \n\nplantations of differing tree density and a semi-natural oak stand were each \n\ninstrumented with three 16 m2 runoff plots and 15 throughfall gauges, which were \n\nmonitored at c. 1- to 2-week intervals over two hydrological years. In addition, surface \n\nmoisture content (0-50mm) and hydrophobicity (0-20mm, 20-50mm and 50-100mm) \n\nwere measured after individual rainfall events. Although all three woodland types \n\nproduced relatively little overland flow (&lt;3% of the incident rainfall overall), the dense \n\neucalypt stand produced twice as much overland flow as the sparse eucalypt and oak \n\nwoodland types, despite similar throughfall amounts. This contrast in overland flow \n\ncan be attributed to infiltration-excess processes operating during dry antecedent \n\nweather conditions when severe hydrophobicity was widespread in the dense eucalypt \n\nplantation as opposed to being moderate and low in the sparse eucalypt plantation and \n\nthe oak stand, respectively. In contrast, under wet conditions more overland flow \n\n(though still small) tended to be produced in the oak woodland than in the two eucalypt \n\nplantations; this was probably linked to saturation-excess overland flow being \n\ngenerated more readily at the oak site as a result of its shallower soil. Differences in \n\nwater retention in surface depressions affected overland flow generation and \n\ndownslope flow transport. Implications of the seasonal differentials in overland flow \n\ngeneration between the three distinct woodland types for the hydrological response of \n\nperi-urban catchments are addressed. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Eucalypt plantations, oak woodland, saturation-excess overland flow, \n\ninfiltration-excess overland flow, hydrophobicity, soil moisture content \n\n4.

Introduction \n\nForest and woodland represent the dominant land-use in Europe, covering 37% of the \n\nearth surface (FAO, 2001) and 35% of mainland Portugal (IFN6, 2013). In recent decades, \n\nglobally forest cover has increased as a result of greater demand for timber and \n\nenvironmental concerns (e.g. Robinson et al., 2003). This increasing tendency is expected \n\nto continue in the future, in response to European policy, linked to the Common \n\nAgricultural Policy and Water Framework Directive. However, forest cover has \n\ndecreased in peri-urban catchments, where urbanization has led to progressive \n\ndeforestation and forest fragmentation (Nowak, 2006). \n\nForest hydrology has been widely documented, particularly with respect to some \n\nhydrological processes. Forest and woodland promote rainfall interception, \n\nevapotranspiration and infiltration, affecting baseflow recharge and storm runoff (e.g. \n\nHewlett, 1969; Scherer and Pike, 2003; Eisenbies et al., 2007). Several studies report the \n\nhydrological impacts of afforestation (Wattenbach et al., 2007; Iroum\u00e9 and Palacios, \n\n2013; Salazar et al., 2013), thinning (Dung et al., 2012; Webb and Kathuria, 2012; \n\nHawthorne et al., 2013) and wildfire (Doerr et al., 1996; Moody et al., 2013; Nyman et \n\nal., 2014), being unanimous as regards to overland flow increase. This increase may \n\nrepresent an additional problem when generated upslope urban areas. \n\nVegetation affects rainfall partitioning and its redistribution, influencing the amount and \n\nspatial distribution of water reaching the ground surface (throughfall) and deeper layers \n\nof the soil (stemflow) (Martinez-Meza and Whitford, 1996). Different tree species are \n\nlinked to different canopy architecture, stem properties and root system, which affect the \n\nfate of water. For example, horizontal leaves direct water to branches, increasing the \n\nstemflow, while vertical leaves tend to increase throughfall (Ferreira, 1996). Crown \n\ncharacteristics affect water flow along branches towards the trunks (Andr\u00e9 et al., 2011). \n\nNevertheless, throughfall and stemflow typically account for 70\u201390% of the net-\n\nprecipitation, with stemflow representing a minor fraction of 5-10% (Herwitz and Levia, \n\n1997; Crockford and Richardson, 2000), which reach 15% in the oak forest in northeast \n\nChina (Wei et al., 2005). Generally, evergreen have lower throughfall than deciduous \n\nspecies (Barbier et al., 2009; Llorens and Domingo, 2007), as well as conifers when \n\ncompared with broadleaves (Freedman and Prager, 1986; Keim et al., 2006). Stemflow \n\ndecreased with bark roughness from smoother to rougher bark (Johnson and Lehmann, \n\n2006; Livesley et al., 2014). Besides interception, transpiration is also dependent on tree \n\nspecies, attributed to distinct stomata, leaf water potential and hydraulic conductance \n\n(Ewers et al., 2002). \n\nIn addition, vegetation type have been associated with the release of different \n\nhydrophobic compounds, such as different resins and waxes (DeBano, 2000; Lozano et \n\nal., 2013; Zavala et al., 2009), leading to soil hydrophobicity which restricts infiltration \n\ncapacity and may enhances overland flow, particularly in seasonally dry environments \n\n(Dekker and Ritsema, 1994). Hydrophobicity is mainly associated with dry settings \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  \n\n \n\n77 \n\n(Doerr and Thomas, 2000; Santos et al., 2013) and may influence seasonal pattern of \n\noverland flow, particularly under Mediterranean climate, marked by a long dry summer \n\nseason (Doerr et al., 2000; Jord\u00e1n et al., 2013). Nevertheless, under eucalypt plantations, \n\nhydrophobicity may persist after several rainfall events (Ferreira, 1996; Ferreira et al., \n\n2000). In a previously rip-ploughed eucalypt plantation area of north-central Portugal, \n\nhydrophobicity was found to explain 74% of overland flow variation (Ferreira et al., \n\n2000). \n\nMany studies have demonstrated differences in degrees of hydrophobicity between \n\ndifferent vegetation types (e.g. DeBano, 2000; Zavala et al., 2009; Lozano et al., 2013). \n\nEucalypt stands are renowned for inducing high levels of hydrophobicity (Ferreira et al., \n\n2000; Santos et al., 2013). In Portugal, some studies have reported greater overland flow \n\nunder eucalypt than pine plantations caused by enhanced soil hydrophobicity (Ferreira et \n\nal., 2000; Keizer et al., 2005), but little is known about the slope hydrology of oak stands, \n\nparticularly in wet Mediterranean climates. This is important as differences in overland \n\nflow between distinct forest stands can contribute to variations in total streamflow and \n\nthe stormflow component with forest land-use change (Fritsch, 1993; Grip et al., 2005). \n\nHowever, in the literature, streamflow differences in areas subject to forest cover changes \n\nare mostly attributed to evapotranspiration adjustments. For example, Otero et al. (1994) \n\nreported reduced streamflow with conversion of native forest to fast-growing plantations \n\nof Pinus radiata. In the southern Appalachians, the conversion of a deciduous hardwood \n\ncatchment to a Pinus strobus L. stand (eastern white pine) led to a 20% reduction of \n\nstreamflow, attributed to the greater vegetative surface area of Pinus strobus (Swank and \n\nDouglass, 1974). \n\nAlthough it is widely accepted that forests regulate water yield and their soils are usually \n\nhighly permeable (Eisenbies et al., 2007; Bathurst et al., 2011), the role of forest areas in \n\nflood protection has been hotly debated. Some have argued that interception and higher \n\nsoil moisture deficits under forest should reduce floods by removing a proportion of the \n\nstorm rainfall (e.g. Bathurst et al., 2011), whereas others have argued that such water \n\nretention by forest is minimal in the extreme rainfall events that are responsible for floods \n\n(Eisenbies et al., 2007; H\u00fcmann et al, 2011; Komatsu et al., 2011). Thus, it is argued that \n\nforest cover might not significantly reduce peak flows during extreme events, particularly \n\nin small catchments, but that it could be effective in reducing the peakflow responses of \n\nmore frequent, less intense rainfall events (Bathurst et al., 2011).  \n\nImpacts of different forest and woodland stands on overland flow may be particularly \n\nimportant in the hydrology of small peri-urban catchments. Such catchments tend to be \n\ncharacterized by a mosaic of different land-uses, which provide varying sources and sinks \n\nof overland flow (Ferreira et al., 2011). Any overland flow generated on forest areas may \n\nreach downslope urban areas and represent an additional contribution to the urban flood \n\nhazard, whereas in other cases forest patches can act as sinks for upslope-generated \n\noverland flow from urban surfaces.

The focus is on \n\nthe roles played by differing temporal regimes in hydrophobicity and soil moisture of the \n\nwoodland types studied. The implications of the results for catchment streamflow \n\nresponse in peri-urban catchments in such environments are also explored. \n\n \n\n4.2. Study Area \n\nThe study was carried out in the peri-urban Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es (8\u00ba27\u00b4W, 40\u00ba13\u00b4N) \n\ncatchment, located 3km NW of Coimbra, the largest city in central Portugal. This \n\ncatchment (6.2 km2) is aligned S-N and ranges in altitude from 34 to 205 m a.s.l. The area \n\nhas a sub-humid Mediterranean climate, with a mean annual temperature of 15\u00b0C and an \n\naverage annual rainfall of 892 mm over the period 1941-2000 recorded at Coimbra-\n\nBencanta (national meteorological weather station 12G/02UG), sited 0.5 km north of the \n\nstudy catchment. A distinct dry and hot season occurs from June to August (8% of annual \n\nrainfall), whereas the rainiest period is between November and March (61% of rainfall).  \n\nRelatively small rainfall events are dominant over the year, with 83% of daily rainfalls \n\nbetween 2001 and 2013 at Coimbra-Bencanta being ?10 mm. Maximum daily rainfalls \n\nover the same 2001-13 period ranged between 20 mm and 102 mm. The catchment is \n\nunderlain by sandstone (57%) and limestone (43%). Soils developed on sandstone are \n\nclassified as Fluvisols and Podzols, following WRB (2006) classification, and are \n\ngenerally deep (>3 m), while Leptic Cambisols found on limestone slopes are typically \n\nshallow (<0.4 m) (Pato, 2007). \n\nThe catchment has undergone profound land-use changes over the last five decades, \n\nmainly associated with rapid urbanization and increased eucalypt planting for timber \n\nproduction. Between 1958 and 2007, the urban and woodland areas expanded from 6 to \n\n32% and from 44 to 64%, respectively, at the expense of a marked decrease in agricultural \n\nland from 48 to 4%. Since 2007, however, deforestation has occurred because of a main \n\nroad construction and the building of an enterprise park, which now occupies 5% of the \n\nformer wooded area. Thus by 2012, the urban area had increased to 40%, while the \n\nwoodland area had decreased to 53%.This trend towards a reduced tree cover and \n\nincreased urbanization is expected to continue. \n\nCurrently, wooded areas consists mainly of eucalypt plantations and few mixed stands of \n\neucalypt and pine (84%), with minor fractions of scrub and herbaceous vegetation (15%) \n\nand relic oak woodland (1%) (Figure 4.1). The major eucalypt plantation species is \n\nEucalypt globulus Labill.. Over the last years, increased eucalypt plantation in detriment \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  \n\n \n\n79 \n\nof pine stands was due to harvesting interval of typically 10-12 as opposed to 50-60 years \n\nfor pine (Robinson et al., 2003), as well as their relatively high commercial value for the \n\npulp industry. Generally, eucalypt plantations are placed over sandstone, but some \n\nabandoned logged areas lead to sparse eucalypt stands which are densely covered by \n\nscrubs. These scrub areas, observed on sandstone, are dominated by heather (Erica \n\nscoparia L. and E. umbellata L.), broom (Pterospartum tridentatum L.) and gorse (Ulex \n\neuropaeus L.), with eucalypt and pine encroachment. On limestone, vegetated areas are \n\nmainly covered by herbaceous associations, represented by grasses (mainly Salvia \n\nverbenaca, Geranium purpureum Vill, Vicia sp.), together with spanish broom (Spartium \n\njuncium L.), cypress (Cupressus sempervirens L.), pine (P. pinea L.) and olive (Olea \n\neuropaea L.) encroachment. A relic of semi-natural oak is also observed in limestone \n\narea, consisting of a mixture of Quercus robur L., Q. faginea broteroi and Q. suber L. \n\ntrees (mean high of 4 m and 25%-50% cover), with strawberry (Arbutus unedo L.) and \n\nlaurel (Laurus nobilis L.) bushes forming the ground cover (average height: 800 mm and \n\n5%-25% cover). Invasive plants such as wattle (Acacia longifolia A.) and mimosa \n\n(Acacia dealbata L.) can be found in small numbers everywhere (Pato, 2007). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1- Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment land-use and location of the study sites instrumented \n\nwith runoff plots. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \u2013 DIFFERENCES IN OVERLAND FLOW DYNAMICS IN DIFFERENT TYPES \n\nOF WOODLAND AREAS WITHIN A PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT  \n\n \n\n80 \n\n4.3. Methodology \n\n4.3.1. Research design and experimental setup \n\nRunoff plots were established in the three principal types of woodland within Ribeira dos \n\nCov\u00f5es (Figure 4.1): (1) dense eucalypt plantation, which may include occasional pine \n\nand acacia trees (plots DE1, DE2 and DE3); (2) sparse eucalypt areas, with an extensive \n\ncover of scrub (SE1, SE2 and SE3); and (3) oak woodland (O1, O2 and O3) (Figure 4.2). \n\nSimilar topographic and soil properties between sites were search for the plot location \n\n(e.g. slope angle, aspect, parent material and soil type). However, the spatial distribution \n\nof woodland types within the catchment and site accessibility led to topographic and \n\nlithological (and hence soil) differences between the three study sites. For instance, dense \n\nand sparse eucalypt areas were largely located on sandstone, whereas oak was only \n\noverlaying on limestone. \n\n \n\na) b) c) \n\n   \n\nFigure 4.2 - Studied woodlands in the Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment: a) dense eucalypt \n\nplantation, b) sparse eucalypt, dominated by scrub, and c) oak woodland. \n\n \n\nEach of the study sites was instrumented with three runoff plots placed 20 \u2013 500 m apart, \n\ndepending on local constraints (e.g. avoiding close proximity to tracks and locations with \n\nextensive stone lag). The plots were 2 m wide by 8 m long, bounded by metal strips of \n\n150 mm high inserted into the soil to a depth of 50-100 mm. A modified Gerlach trough \n\n(Gerlach, 1967) was installed at the outlet of each plot to collect the overland flow and to \n\nretain the >0.5 mm fraction of the eroded material with the aid of a mesh. Overland flow \n\nwas then routed via a garden hose, first to an automatic tipping-bucket device with a \n\ncapacity of 0.5-L per tip (connected to a data logger), using an in-house design, and then \n\nto a 50-L tank. Plot installation was completed on 10th January 2011, but data collection \n\nstarted one month later, in order for the plots to recover from any disturbance caused \n\nduring installation. \n\nEach plot was further equipped with five throughfall gauges as well as with five automatic \n\nsoil moisture probes to give an approximate idea of differences between woodland types. \n\nThe throughfall gauges comprised funnels (\u00d8 200 mm) connected to a storage bottle, \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  \n\n \n\n81 \n\ninstalled within half-buried PVC pipes (\u00d8 200 mm; height: 300 mm). The five gauges \n\nwere placed randomly 0.5-2 m outside the plot boundaries beneath the tree and/or scrub \n\nvegetation. The soil moisture probes (Decagon EC-5, connected to Hobbo data logger) \n\nwere divided amongst three soil depths (2 sensors at 0-20 mm, 2 sensors at 50-100 mm, \n\nand 1 sensor at 150-200 mm) and installed at 2-5 m distance from the plot boundaries. \n\nVolumetric soil moisture content was recorded at 5-min intervals. Laboratory calibration \n\nper woodland site was performed before installation in the field, using columns of sieved \n\nsoil (<2 mm) from the sites where the sensor was going to be installed, on repacked soil \n\nmaterial at the average dry bulk density of the sites. A linear curve was found to provide \n\nthe best calibration for the sensor data in the three woodland sites. However, theft of \n\ndevices considerably restricted soil moisture data acquisition. \n\nOverland flow and throughfall were measured at mostly 1- to 2- weekly intervals, \n\ndepending on previous rainfall, during the two years of study (9th February 2011 \u2013 14th \n\nApril 2013), in a total of 61 measurement occasions. Throughfall measurements in the \n\noak woodland started later than the plot measurements on 23rd March 2011. A visual \n\ngeneral description of the vegetation cover was performed at the beginning of the study \n\nperiod. \n\nIn the second week of March 2012, part of the dense eucalypt site was clear-felled, \n\naffecting two of the three existing plots (DE1 and DE2). Plot DE2 had to be abandoned \n\nsince it was destroyed by logging activities.  Owing to vandalism (theft in particular), the \n\nother two plots at the dense eucalypt site could only be monitored for total runoff. \n\nFurthermore, due to theft of equipment on several occasions after clear-felling, \n\nthroughfall measurement at the dense eucalypt plot locations was also abandoned. \n\nRainfall was recorded continuously using five tipping-bucket rain-gauges (Davis \n\nInstruments) in open areas within and near the catchment. No significant inter-gauge \n\nspatial rainfall variation was identified, so that the weighted average of the five \n\nraingauges was used. \n\n \n\n4.3.2. Soil data collection \n\nDuring monitoring, at the same time as overland flow measurements, soil hydrophobicity \n\nwas assessed at 0-20 mm, 20-50 mm and 50-100 mm depths along two 1-m transects at \n\neither side of each plot using the \u2018Molarity of an Ethanol Drop test\u2019 (Doerr, 1998). Sets \n\nof fifteen droplets of increasing ethanol concentration were applied along each transect \n\nuntil infiltration of at least eight droplets of the same concentration occurred within 5 \n\nseconds. The results for each transect were classified according to the following five \n\nrepellency ratings and associated ethanol concentrations: wettable (0%); low (1, 3 and \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \u2013 DIFFERENCES IN OVERLAND FLOW DYNAMICS IN DIFFERENT TYPES \n\nOF WOODLAND AREAS WITHIN A PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT  \n\n \n\n82 \n\n5%); moderate (8.5 and 13%); severe (18 and 24 %); and extreme (36 and >36 %) \n\nhydrophobicity.   \n\nIn addition, on each fieldwork visit, one composite sample per plot (0-50 mm soil depth), \n\nobtained by mixing 10 samples collected randomly on undisturbed land around each plot. \n\nGravimetric was converted into volumetric water content using the mean soil bulk density \n\nof each site, calculated from 11 random samples of  143 cm3 volume collected near to \n\neach plot, using soil ring samplers of 50 mm diameter. These laboratory measurements \n\nwere considered highly important to assure soil moisture data over the study period, since \n\nmalfunctioning and theft of soil moisture probes severely restricted the field data \n\naquisition. Because of this, the soil moisture data used in the results and discussion \n\nsections relates to the soil samples and laboratory assessment, thus no soil moisture data \n\nfrom probes are shown.  \n\nThroughout the first year of study, soil matrix infiltration capacity was measured on 12 \n\noccasions, covering different weather conditions. The measurements were performed \n\nwith a mini-disk tension infiltrometer (Decagon Devices), carrying out one experiment \n\nalongside each transect. Overall, 216 measurements were performed. Unsaturated \n\nhydraulic conductivity (Kuns) was calculated from soil matrix infiltration capacity, based \n\non Decagon's instruction manual (Decagon, 2007). \n\nThe physical properties of surface soil (0-50 mm) were sampled in January 2011. Around \n\neach runoff plot, six core samples of 137.4 cm3 were collected to determine dry bulk \n\ndensity following Dane and Topp (2002). In addition, 10 sub-samples were collected \n\nmanually with a scoop and mixed to create one composite sample of c. 1.5 kg per plot. \n\nThese samples were then oven dried at 38\u00b0C until a constant weight was reached and \n\nsieved to obtain the&lt;2 mm fraction. This fine-earth fraction was analyzed with respect \n\nto organic matter content using infra-red detection after oxidation at 600\u00b0C (SC-144DR \n\nequipment, Strohlein Instruments) (LECO, 1997) and particle size distribution, using the \n\nstandard pipette method (Dane and Topp, 2002). \n\n \n\n4.3.3. Data analysis \n\nIn view of the non-normal distribution of the overland flow, throughfall, soil moisture \n\nand hydrophobicity data, non-parametric statistical tests were used to assess differences \n\nin median values between the three forest types and between plots of the same forest type. \n\nThe Kruskal\u2013Wallis test was employed to test the significance (p<0.05) of the differences \n\nwith woodland type in overland flow, throughfall, hydrophobicity and soil moisture, and \n\ntheir seasonal variations. The Spearman correlation coefficient (r) was used to assess \n\nwhether significant associations (p<0.05 and p<0.01) existed between rainfall \n\ncharacteristics (1- to 2-weekly totals, maximum 30-min rainfall intensities (I30) and \n\nantecedent rainfall over the previous 30 days) and soil hydrological properties \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  \n\n \n\n83 \n\n(hydrophobicity and soil moisture), as well as overland flow. All statistical analyses were \n\ncarried out using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software. \n\n \n\n4.4. Results and analysis \n\n4.4.1. Biophysical properties of the study sites \n\nVegetation differences between sites are linked to the woodland types and can be \n\nobserved in Table 3.1. The greater tree density is clearly found in the dense eucalypt \n\nstands and contrast with the dominant cover of scrubs in sparse eucalypt areas. Despite \n\nthe lower trees density in oak compared with dense eucalypt, oak canopy covers all the \n\nwoodland area. Under dense eucalypt stands, the clear-felling performed in the first week \n\nof February 2012, removed the canopy cover, but biomass waste (leaves and smaller \n\nbranches) was left on site. Eucalypt regrowth started in late April, following some rain \n\nbut became more rapid by autumn. At the beginning of January 2013, a few trees \n\nsurrounding the O2 plot were cut and the tree canopy cover decreased by about 20% near \n\nthe upper boundary. Despite not being measured, the canopy cover decreased in \n\nautumn/winter for these deciduous trees, with a corresponding increase in the litter layer. \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \u2013 DIFFERENCES IN OVERLAND FLOW DYNAMICS IN DIFFERENT TYPES \n\nOF WOODLAND AREAS WITHIN A PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT  \n\n \n\n84 \n\n \n\nTable 4.1 \u2013 Biophysical characteristics of the three study sites in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment. \n\nS: sandy, SL: sandy loam, L: loamy, LS: loamy sand. \n\n  \n\n \n\nThe location of woodland types across the catchment and problems with accessibility led \n\nto differences in the site characteristics and soil properties between runoff plots (Table \n\n3.1). Dense eucalypt plots were mainly on W- and NW-facing moderate slopes, sparse \n\neucalypt on NE-facing steeper slopes, whereas oak locates on W-facing gentle slopes. \n\nOak woodland, was on loamy soil laid on limestone, contrasting with dense and sparse \n\neucalypt stands, mostly sandy loam and loamy sand soils, respectively, overlying \n\nsandstone. Soil depth in oak forest site (~0.4 m) was lower than in hardwood and scrub \n\n(>2m). Soil organic matter was significantly lower in sparse eucalypt sites (4%) than in \n\nthe dense eucalypt plantation (8%) or in the oak woodland (6%). In contrast, the soil of \n\nthe sparse eucalypt site had a significantly higher bulk density (1.22 g cm-3) than that of \n\nthe dense eucalypt site (0.69 g cm-3) and of the oak site (0.73 g cm-3).  \n\nUnsaturated hydraulic conductivity ranged from very slow (?1 mm h-1) to slow (>1 mm \n\nand ?5 mm h-1) over the year, according to Kohnke\u2019s (1968) classification (Figure 4.3). \n\nValues were in general higher in dense eucalypt (0.9 mm h-1) than in sparse eucalypt and \n\noak (0.6 mm h-1 for both woodland types) (p<0.05). Over the year, Kuns in eucalypt sites \n\n(dense and open) was greater in winter and spring seasons than in summer and autumn \n\n(dense: 1.4 vs 0.6 mm h-1; open: 0.7 vs 0.3 mm h-1; p<0.05), whereas in oak woodland no \n\nsignificant difference was observed (p>0.05). Kuns increased with increasing soil organic \n\nmatter content (r=0.60, p<0.01) and decreased with increasing bulk density (r=-0.34, \n\np<0.01). It was also affected by particle size, increasing with a greater sand fraction \n\n(r=0.74, p<0.01) and decreasing with increasing silt and clay fractions (r=-0.72 and -0.47, \n\np<0.01). \n\nWoodland type\n\nPlot reference ED1 ED2 ED3 EO1 EO2 EO3 O1 O2 O3\n\nTrees  (number ha\n-1\n\n) 800 1300 900\n\nStage of trees \n\ndevelopment (years)\n\nMature \n\n(~15)\n\nYoung \n\n(~5)\n\nYoung \n\n(~8)\n\nVegetation (cover, \n\nheight)\n\n15%,    \n\n0.15 m\n0%\n\n95%,     \n\n0.5 m\n\n100%,     \n\n0.8 m\n\n100%,     \n\n1.5 m\n\n100%,     \n\n1 m\n\n40%,     \n\n0.8 m\n\n55%,     \n\n0.8 m\n\n75%,       \n\n1 m\n\nLitter layer (cm) 2 5&lt;1&lt;1 2 1 1 2 1\n\nElevation (m) 138 132 137 105 105 105 90 92 91\n\nSlope aspect W NW NW NE NE NE W W W\n\nSlope (\u00b0) 18 16 26 26 28 26 13 16 22\n\nLithology\n\nSoil depth (m)\n\nTexture SL S SL LS LS SL L L L\n\n     Sand 80 95 75 44 59 65 53 49 45\n\n     Silt 7 3 10 18 15 17 27 31 38\n\n     Clay 13 2 15 39 26 18 20 20 17\n\nOrganic matter (%) 8 7 9 5 4 3 7 7 6\n\nBulk density (g cm\n-3\n) 0.74\u00b10.38 0.69\u00b10.23 0.64\u00b10.11 1.28\u00b10.24 1.13\u00b10.29 1.24\u00b10.40 0.80\u00b10.29 0.65\u00b10.11 0.75\u00b10.16\n\nDense eucalypt Open eucalypt Oak  \n\nV\ne\ng\ne\nta\n\nti\no\nn\n\n a\nn\n\nd\n l\n\nit\nte\n\nr\n \n\nc\no\nv\ne\nr\n\n150 500 (canopy fully covers the area)\n\nMature (~10) Adult (~80)\n\nT\no\np\n\no\ng\nr\na\np\n\nh\ny\n\nS\no\nil\n\n p\nr\no\np\n\ne\nr\nti\n\ne\ns\n\nSandstone Sandstone Limestone\n\n>2m >2m ~0.4m\n\nParticle size distribution (%)\n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  \n\n \n\n85 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 \u2013 Temporal variation of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity between woodland sites.  \n\n \n\n4.4.2.

Throughfall \n\nOverall throughfall for the period 2nd April 2011 to 5th March 2012 (periods 3-23), when \n\nmeasurements were carried out at all three woodland sites, was higher in dense eucalypt \n\n(99% of rainfall) than in sparse eucalypt (85%) and oak stands (67%) (Figure 4.5). For \n\nthe 2-year period 2nd April 2011 to 14th April 2013 (periods 3-61), however, overall \n\nthroughfall represented 97% and 72% of rainfall in sparse eucalypt and oak stands \n\nrespectively. In both periods, no significant difference was identified in percentage \n\nthroughfall between woodland types (p>0.05). No significant difference in throughfall \n\nbetween the gauges installed in each runoff plot was identified, except in O1 (overall \n\nstudy period average and standard deviation of 21\u00b122 mm) and sparse eucalypt plots \n\n(SE1: 23\u00b123 mm, SE2: 27\u00b121 mm and SE3: 23\u00b123 mm) (p<0.05). \n\nThroughfall represented variable fractions of the rainfall over the year, with generally \n\nlower values under oak (85\u00b133%) than eucalypt woodland (96\u00b150% and 96\u00b134% in both \n\ndense and sparse eucalypt). Nevertheless, there were monitored periods where the \n\nthroughfall amounted to higher values than the rainfall in all the study sites, particularly \n\nin dense eucalypt areas and, for fewer measurements, under oak woodland. Median \n\ndifferences between rainfall and throughfall reached 6-7 mm in dense eucalypt (6.7, 6.0 \n\nand 6.8 mm in DE1, DE2 and DE3, respectively), 4-5 mm in sparse eucalypt (4.5, 4.3 and \n\n5.1 mm in SE1, SE2 and SE3, respectively) and 4-6 mm in oak woodland (3.7, 5.6 and \n\n4.1 mm in SE1, SE2 and SE3, respectively). Nevertheless, maximum water retention \n\nreached 30-38 mm at the dense eucalypt, 30-40 mm at the sparse eucalypt and 18-20 mm \n\nat the oak woodland for the period 11, during autumn (maximum rainfall and I30 for the \n\nwhole study period, Figure 4.3).  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \u2013 DIFFERENCES IN OVERLAND FLOW DYNAMICS IN DIFFERENT TYPES \n\nOF WOODLAND AREAS WITHIN A PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT  \n\n \n\n88 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5 - Weighted average rainfall amount and median throughfall per woodland type, for \n\nthe 61 measurement periods from 9th February 2011 to 14th April 2013.

However, \n\nthere was not a significant seasonal pattern of throughfall (p>0.05). Despite throughfall \n\nincreased with rainfall, in smaller storm events the percentage of rainfall intercepted was \n\nalso greater, particularly during drier periods. No throughfall was measured in any of the \n\nplots for rainfalls of 3.3 mm and 3.7 mm measured during summer (periods 10 and 34). \n\nHowever, for a rainfall event of 3.7 mm measured in late winter (period 23), throughfall \n\nrepresented 14% and 7% of the rainfall in dense eucalypt and oak woodland (under sparse \n\neucalypt throughfall was higher than rainfall). \n\n \n\n4.4.3.2. Hydrophobicity \n\nIn all the soil layers, hydrophobicity was most severe and frequent in the dense eucalypt \n\nplantations, intermediate in the sparse eucalypt stand and lowest in the oak woodland  \n\n(p<0.05) (Figure 4.6). In the oak stand, hydrophobicity was absent on most measurement \n\ndates (69% at both 0-20 mm and 20-50 mm and 48% at 50-100 mm) and was largely of \n\nlow or moderate severity when present. Hydrophobicity was mainly transient in nature, \n\nbeing recorded in all the sampling sites only on 14%, 13% and 17% of monitoring \n\noccasions, at 0-20 mm, 20-50 mm and 50-100 mm depth respectively. In the sparse \n\neucalypt site, hydrophobicity showed the greatest spatial and temporal variations with \n\nhydrophilic conditions dominant on 49%, 34% and 39% of the measurement dates, at 0-\n\n20 mm, 20-50 mm and 50-100 mm, respectively, but with moderate to severe classes \n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n2500\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45 47 49 51 53 55 57 59 61\n\nR\na\nin\n\nfa\nll\n\n (\nm\n\nm\n)\n\nT\nh\n\nro\nu\n\ng\nh\n\nfa\nll\n\n (\nm\n\nm\n)\n\nMonitoring periods\n\nRainfall Dense eucalypt Sparse eucalypt Oak\n\n2011 2012 2013\n\nW.

Similar to oak woodland, \n\nthe sparse eucalypt stand also showed a transient and patchy hydrophobic pattern, with \n\nwidespread hydrophobic properties recorded in just 26% of the 61 measurement periods \n\nat 0-20 mm and 50-100 mm and 24% of occasions at 20-50 mm depth. In contrast, in \n\ndense eucalypt plantations, hydrophilic conditions were only observed on 41, 15 and 13% \n\nof occasions, at 0-20 mm, 20-50 mm and 50-100 mm depth respectively, with severe to \n\nextreme hydrophobic properties being dominant and widespread, forming a continuous \n\nsurface area in 53, 55 and 70%, respectively, of  occasions when hydrophobicity was \n\npresent. \n\nHydrophobicity showed the same marked seasonal patterns at all three study sites. It was \n\ntypically absent during late autumn and winter, and most severe and widespread during \n\nsummer. After dry periods, hydrophobicity was more resistant to being broken down \n\nduring rainfall events in eucalypt plantations and disappeared earlier in oak woodland. \n\nAlso, when drier conditions were restored, hydrophobicity was re-established more \n\nquickly under eucalypt than under oak. Thus after the largest rainfalls in autumn 2011 \n\nand beginning of winter 2012, hydrophobicity required five months longer to reappear in \n\noak than in the eucalypt stands.   \n\nIn dense eucalypt stands, hydrophobicity increased in frequency and severity with soil \n\ndepth (increasing from 44 to 59% of the monitored periods between 0-20 mm and 50-100 \n\nmm layers, p<0.05). Also, a greater number of rainstorms were required to reduce \n\nhydrophobicity levels in deeper soil. Extreme hydrophobicity was recorded on 18, 13 and \n\n30% of occasions, respectively, at 0-20 mm, 20-50 mm and 50-100 mm. A similar pattern \n\nwith depth occurred in the sparse eucalypt site, despite lower hydrophobicity severity and \n\ncoverage (extreme hydrophobicity was recorded in 8, 13 and 15% of occasions, at 0-20 \n\nmm, 20-50 mm and 50-100 mm depth respectively). In contrast to eucalypt sites, \n\nhydrophobicity did not vary statistically with soil depth in oak woodland (p>0.05), \n\nalthough it showed a tendency to decrease in severity but increase in temporal frequency \n\nwith soil depth (Figure 4.6).  \n\nAlthough hydrophobicity severity and spatial frequency varied with antecedent weather \n\nat all stands and at all depths, inverse relationships with storm rainfall and throughfall \n\namount, although statistically significant (p<0.01), are weak (r never exceeding -0.31) \n\nand are not statistically significant in the case of maximum rainfall intensity (p>0.05). \n\nParticle size and organic matter content were weakly correlated with hydrophobicity. \n\nHydrophobicity slightly increased with increasing sand content (r=0.25, 0.28 and 0.34 for \n\nincreasing soil depths, p<0.01) and organic matter content at the subsurface (r=0.14, 0.16 \n\nand 0.22 for increasing soil depths, p<0.01), and was negatively correlated with silt (r=-\n\n0.26, -0.30 and -0.36 for deeper soil layers, p<0.01) and clay (r=-0.15, -0.18 and -0.23 for \n\nincreasing soil depths, p<0.01) fractions. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \u2013 DIFFERENCES IN OVERLAND FLOW DYNAMICS IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF WOODLAND AREAS WITHIN A PERI-URBAN \n\nCATCHMENT  \n\n \n\n90 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6 - Temporal variability of frequency distribution of hydrophobicity classes per woodland type and soil depth (0-20 mm, 20-50 mm and 50-100 mm) \n\nfor the 61 measurement periods from 9th February 2011 to 14th April 2013. \n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 54 56 58 60\n\nF\nre\n\nq\nu\ne\nn\nc\ny\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nDense eucalypt (0-20mm)\n\nHydrophilic Low Moderate Severe Extreme\n\n2011 2012 2013\n\nW.

Soil moisture content  \n\nMedian surface soil moisture content (0-50 mm), measured under laboratory conditions \n\nfor samples collected during monitoring periods, was similar between dense (15%) and \n\nsparse (18%) eucalypt stands (p>0.05), but both were significantly lower than at oak sites \n\n(29%) (p<0.05) (Figure 4.7). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7 - Median surface soil moisture content per woodland type for the 61 measurement \n\nperiods from 9th February 2011 to 14th April 2013. \n\n \n\nDuring the study period, no significant difference on soil moisture content was found \n\namong the three plots at the dense and sparse eucalypt sites (p>0.05). However, under \n\noak woodland, plot O2 had significantly higher values than the other two plots (O1: 29%, \n\nO2: 35% and O3: 25%) (p<0.05). In dense eucalypt stands, DE1 clear-felling in March \n\n2012 (period 22) did not significantly affect soil moisture content, but it seemed to change \n\nthe spatial patterns. Before logging, higher soil moisture content was measured in ED3, \n\nwhereas after clear-felling it was observed in DE1, but differences became more alike \n\nwith eucalypt regeneration in DE1. Despite not clearly noticed, thinning of 20% of O3 \n\ncanopy cover (period 48) may slightly increase soil moisture content. In fact, soil moisture \n\nwas generally lowest in plot O3 before thinning, whereas after it was greater than O1, but \n\nstill lower than O2.  \n\nSoil moisture content increased significantly with preceding period rainfall amount and \n\nthroughfall (p<0.01), although the relationships were not very strong (Table 4.2). It was \n\nsubstantially lower in summer than during the other seasons (p<0.05), with a similar \n\nmedian value (8%) for all woodland types.

During spring, median soil moisture content was higher in 2013 (22%) than in both \n\n2011 (16%) and 2012 (11%) (p<0.05). Through autumn, soil moisture was significantly \n\nhigher in 2011 than in 2012 (28% vs 17%) (p<0.05). Over winter, median soil moisture \n\nreached highest values in 2013 (26 % compared with 19% in 2011 and 20% in 2012). \n\nGenerally, higher soil moisture content was observed during autumn 2011 (median values \n\nof 27%, 33% and 27% for DE, SE and O, respectively), winter 2013 (median values of \n\n23%, 24% and 36% for DE, SE and O, respectively) and spring 2013 (median values of \n\n18%, 22% and 36% for DE, SE and O, respectively). Soil moisture content reached \n\nhighest values of 37%, 32% and 49% in DE, SE and O in winter 2013, but the peak value \n\nof 47% in the SE site was attained in autumn 2011. \n\nOverall, considering the results from all plots together, soil moisture content increased \n\nsignificantly with increasing rainfall and throughfall amounts, but the relationship were \n\nrather weak (r=0.25 and 0.20, respectively, p<0.01), even excluding the summers season \n\ndue to the lowest throughfall percentages associated with driest conditions. Nevertheless, \n\nno significant correlation between soil moisture and rainfall was identified in oak \n\nwoodland. Rainfall intensity was not significantly correlated with soil moisture content \n\n(p>0.05). Hydrophobicity decreased with soil moisture increase, but correlations were \n\nweaker at greater soil depth (r=-0.51, -0.52 and -0.42 for depths of 0-20 mm, 20-50 mm \n\nand 50-100 mm). Generally, soil moisture differences between runoff plots may be \n\npartially explained by topographic characteristics and soil properties, considering their \n\nsignificant influence despite the poor correlations. Soil moisture decreased with \n\nincreasing slope angle (r=-0.32,&lt;0.01) and was affected by particle size distribution, \n\nincreasing with increasing silt (r=0.20, p<0.01) and clay (r=0.09, p<0.05) contents and \n\ndecreasing with sand content (r=-0.19, p<0.01), although the weak correlations. \n\n \n\n4.4.3.4. Overland flow \n\nOverland flow was generated in most measurement periods (97, 92 and 89% of the \n\noccasions for dense eucalypt, sparse eucalypt and oak stands, respectively), although \n\nrunoff coefficients represented less than 1% over the 2 years (Figure 4.8). Overland flow \n\nexceeded 1% of period rainfall on just 8, 4 and 3 occasions out of 61 for dense eucalypt, \n\nsparse eucalypt and oak sites respectively, but never exceeded 3%. Overland flow was \n\nsignificantly higher in the dense eucalypt plantation than in the sparse eucalypt and oak \n\nstands (overall values of 6.9 mm, 2.6 mm and 2.9 mm, respectively) (p<0.05).  \n\nDifferences in the temporal pattern of overland flow were also observed between \n\nwoodland stands. Dense eucalypt plantation plots generated greater percentage overland \n\nflow (medians of up to 2.2%) in rainstorms occurring in dry settings (late spring, summer \n\nand at the beginning of autumn), whereas in wet conditions it was lower than 1.0%. In \n\nthe sparse eucalypt stand, overland flow varied less over the year, with maximum runoff \n\ncoefficients of 0.5% and 1.2% in both dry and wet settings (mainly in spring, autumn and \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  \n\n \n\n93 \n\nwinter periods). In the dense eucalypt plantation, the highest percentage overland flow \n\nvalues were recorded in rainfall events that were moderate (4-23 mm and I30= 3-16 mm \n\nh-1) and in the sparse eucalypt stand highest percentage overland flow occurred in \n\nrelatively small rainfall events (4-10 mm and I30=3-6 mm h\n-1). In contrast to eucalypt \n\nsites, overland flow in oak woodland was mainly produced after the wettest antecedent \n\nweather and soil moisture conditions, attaining higher values mainly after larger rainfall \n\nevents (>10 mm), which were mostly experienced in winter and spring 2013, the wettest \n\nmeasurement periods in the 2-year study. Even under the wettest conditions, however, \n\nthe runoff coefficient only reached 2.2% in the oak stand (but median values of three \n\nreplicated plots did not exceed 0.6%), whereas following dry weather it did not exceed \n\n0.4%.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8 - Median overland flow, expressed as amount and percentage rainfall, per woodland \n\ntype for the 61 measurement periods from 9th February 2011 to 14th April 2013. \n\n \n\nUnder dense eucalypt plantation, overland flow did not vary much between runoff plots, \n\neven after clear-felling (p>0.05), except immediately after disturbance. Before tree clear-\n\nfelling (period 22), DE1 showed slightly higher overland flow amount than the other plots \n\n(DE1: 4.0 mm, DE2: 1.9 mm and DE3: 3.3 mm), whereas after that, the difference was \n\nmore noticeable until period 36 (DE1: 1.3 mm and DE3: 0.9 mm). Immediately after \n\nharvesting, the clear-felled plot (DE1) showed the highest overland flow of the study \n\nperiod (2.3%) whereas in DE3 it did not exceed 1.0%. However, with faster vegetation \n\nregeneration after September 2012 due to rainfall increase after the dry period, overland \n\nflow in the harvested plot DE1 became lower than in the intact DE3 (2.3 mm vs 2.9 mm, \n\nrespectively). \n\nContrary to dense eucalypt woodland, plots installed in sparse eucalypt and oak sites \n\nshowed significant differences (p<0.05). In the sparse eucalypt stand, overland flow was \n\nhigher on SE3, installed on intermediate vegetation density but with a greater number of \n\ntrees nearby, showed higher overland flow than SE1 and SE2 (total overland flow: 5.9, \n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n5.00.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45 47 49 51 53 55 57 59 61\n\nO\nv\n\ne\nrl\n\na\nn\n\nd\n f\n\nlo\nw\n\n c\no\n\ne\nff\n\nic\nie\n\nn\nt \n\n(%\n)\n\nO\nv\n\ne\nrl\n\na\nn\n\nd\n f\n\nlo\nw\n\nv\no\n\nlu\nm\n\ne\n  \n\n(m\nm\n\n)\n\nMonitoring periods\n\nDense eucalypt Sparse eucalypt Oak\n\n2011 2012 2013\n\nW.

In the oak site, overland flow was \n\nlower on O1 than at the O2 and O3 plots (2-year totals of 1.9 mm, 4.3 mm and 3.2 mm, \n\nrespectively). The number of overland flow events showed a gradual increase with \n\ndecreasing vegetation density (54 events in O3, 56 in O2 and 59 in O1, out of 61). The \n\ndecrease of 20% in canopy cover on plot O3, between periods 48 and 49, however, did \n\nnot significantly affect overland flow.  \n\nOverland flow increased significantly with period rainfall (amount and intensity) and \n\nthroughfall (Table 4.2), but the strength of the correlations varied with woodland type. \n\nDense eucalypt plantation exhibited stronger correlations between overland flow and \n\nrainfall variables than the other woodland types (DE: r=0.61 and 0.62, SE: r=0.44 and \n\n0.34, and O: r=0.53 and 0.27 for rainfall amount and I30, respectively, p<0.01). Oak \n\nwoodland showed stronger correlations than eucalypt plantations between overland flow \n\nand throughfall amount (0.48, 0.46 and 0.60 for DE, SE and O stands, respectively, \n\np<0.01), as well as rainfall in the previous 30 days (r=0.43 and 0.26 for O and SE, \n\np<0.01). No significant correlation was found between overland flow and antecedent \n\nrainfall within dense eucalypt site (p>0.5).  \n\nGenerally, overland flow correlated significantly neither with hydrophobicity or soil \n\nmoisture content within woodland areas (p>0.05, Table 4.2). Separating monitoring \n\nperiods into wettable and hydrophobic conditions at the surface did not produce \n\nsignificant correlations with overland flow volume or coefficient. However, considering \n\nindividual woodland types, overland flow increased with soil moisture content in the oak \n\nand sparse eucalypt plantations, although correlation coefficients were weak (r=0.21 and \n\n0.29, respectively, p<0.05). \n\nA synthesis of significant correlations is shown on Table 4.2.

Discussion \n\n4.5.1. Spatio-temporal pattern of hydrological properties and \n\nwoodland type \n\n4.5.1.1. Throughfall \n\nDespite the reported important role of vegetation structure and architecture in influencing \n\nthroughfall amount (N\u00e1var, 1993; Levia and Herwitz, 2005; Levia et al., 2010; Livesley \n\net al., 2014), no significant differences in throughfall were identified between the different \n\nwoodland types in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es. Nevertheless, throughfall slightly increased from \n\ndense eucalypt, to oak and sparse eucalypt, following decreasing tree density. According \n\nto Andr\u00e9 et al. (2011) more horizontal branches in oak trees would favour drip \n\ndevelopment, enhancing throughfall. Differences in tree density and species, as well as \n\ndissimilarities in the stage of tree development between individual dense eucalypt plots \n\nand between woodland stands (Table 4.1), may explain the throughfall similarities found \n\n(Ferreira, 1996; Pypker et al, 2005; Barbier et al., 2009). For instance, the larger \n\ndifferences found within dense eucalypt plots did not show a significant influence on \n\nthroughfall. Young forest have been reported to provide significantly lower canopy water \n\nstorage capacity and higher direct throughfall relative to old-growth forest (Pypker et al, \n\n2005). Barbier et al. (2009), measured an increase of 16% of net precipitation from young \n\nto adult evergreen forests. Ferreira (1996) reported throughfall decreases in Eucalypt \n\nglobulus Labill. stands from 90 to 86% for trees 5 and 10 years in age. A 5% average \n\nincrease in throughfall was measured during the dormant phase in the Belgian deciduous \n\nforest relative to the growing season (Andr\u00e9 et al., 2011).  \n\nThe study performed in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es did not allow extrapolation of the influence \n\nof harvesting at the dense eucalypt site (due to theft) nor thinning in O3 plot. Nevertheless, \n\nthese management activities are expected to increase throughfall. In southern France, tree \n\nthinning carried out to reduce 33% of the stem basal area of an evergreen Q. ilex coppice, \n\ncaused a decrease of 31 to 20% in interception losses (Limousin et al., 2008).  \n\nIn Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es throughfall percentages were generally higher than those reported \n\nin literature dealing with similar woodland stands. In eucalypt plantations in Ribeira dos \n\nCov\u00f5es, median throughfall was 98%, whereas Valente et al. (1997) reported 58-92% \n\nthroughfall under Eucalyptus globulus Labill. stands elsewhere in Portugal, whereas a \n\nreview by Llorens and Domingo (2007) indicated 85-88% under E. globulus.  \n\nThe larger scrub cover in sparse eucalypt stand of Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, which extended \n\nabove throughfall gauges, may be the reason for the slightly lower throughfall than that \n\nrecorded in the dense eucalypt plantation (98 and 87%, respectively), with its limited \n\nunderbrush cover (Table 4.1). However, since throughfall measurements were made ~30 \n\ncm above the soil surface, actual interception by scrub less than 30 cm high would be \n\nmissed and throughfall would be smaller than the values recorded. Previous studies have, \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  \n\n \n\n97 \n\nhowever, also reported interception losses declining under short vegetation compared \n\nwith trees, due to lower aerodynamic roughness (Robinson et al., 2003). In shrubs and \n\nbushes mean relative throughfall of about 49% has been reported (Llorens and Domingo, \n\n2007).  \n\nDespite, to the author\u2019 knowledge, no throughfall measurements having been previously \n\nundertaken in Q. robur, Q. faginea or Q. suber (the woodland species found in the oak \n\nstand within the catchment), the results from Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es (average throughfall of \n\n85%) are higher than those reported for Q. cerris L. (85-89%), Q. pyrenaica, (83-86%), \n\nQ. coccifera (55%) and Q. ilex (60-78%) (Llorens and Domingo, 2007).  \n\nThroughfall was found to be affected by rainfall amount and intensity as reported in \n\nprevious studies (e.g. Ferreira, 1996; Gash, 1979; Shachnovich et al., 2008; Andr\u00e9 et al., \n\n2011). No significant seasonal pattern of throughfall was observed over the study period, \n\nas reported in previous deciduous trees studies (Cape et al., 1991). However, generally \n\nlower throughfall values were measured in drier than wetter periods. For instance, rainfall \n\nof a particular amount in summer can be fully intercepted, whereas the same rainfall in \n\nwinter can generate throughfall (periods 34 and 23). This may be related to antecedent \n\nvegetation moisture content and evapotranspiration rate, associated with antecedent \n\nweather conditions (rainfall and temperature) (Gash, 1979; Crockford and Richardson, \n\n2000; Limousin et al., 2008). For the smallest rainfall events, throughfall represents water \n\npassing between canopy gaps (direct throughfall), since water hitting vegetation is \n\nretained, whereas for increasing rainfall volumes, additional indirect throughfall is \n\ngenerated from water dripping onto the ground, as a result of canopy storage capacity \n\nexceedance. Increased vegetation interception during drier seasons results from generally \n\nlower rainfall, which may be insufficient to saturate the canopy, and higher evaporation \n\n(Hewlett, 1969). In addition, during the summer, the interval between rainfall events is \n\ngenerally larger, leading to lower vegetation moisture content. In a north-central \n\nPortuguese pine and eucalypt forest, rainfall interception during discontinuous storms \n\nwas twice as high as during continuous ones, due to evaporation of water retained in the \n\nvegetation canopy between rainfall events (Ferreira, 1996).  \n\nThroughfall results from Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es must be interpreted as indicative. \n\nThroughfall measurements include the influence of trees canopy as well as scrub \n\nvegetation in eucalypt and oak woodland, leading to overestimation of water retention by \n\ntrees when compared with other studies. Furthermore, a larger number of throughfall \n\ngauges should be used in order to perform a better assessment, better accounting for the \n\nspatial variation. Ziegler et al. (2009) reported that several trees could combine channel \n\nstemflow to common drip points on a trunk and large limbs, and, therefore, cause \n\nmeasured throughfall to exceed rainfall. Large spatial variability associated with \n\nthroughfall has been reported elsewhere, attributed to precipitation patterns and structural \n\ncharacteristics of the trees (Carlyle-Moses et al., 2004; Shachnovich et al., 2008; Rodrigo \n\nand \u00c1vila, 2001). Different number of measurements have been used to quantify \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \u2013 DIFFERENCES IN OVERLAND FLOW DYNAMICS IN DIFFERENT TYPES \n\nOF WOODLAND AREAS WITHIN A PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT  \n\n \n\n98 \n\nthroughfall, varying between 9 (e.g. Rodrigo and \u00c1vila, 2001), 20 (Shachnovich et al, \n\n2008), 38 (Carlyle-Moses et al., 2004), 94 (Keim et al., 2005) and 180 (Ziegler et al., \n\n2009). Rodrigo and \u00c1vila (2001) declared that the number of collectors should not be \n\n<30, in order to obtain a good estimate of throughfall. \n\n \n\n4.5.1.2. Hydrophobicity  \n\nIn Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, soil hydrophobicity was high and resistant to breakdown under \n\neucalypt stands (particularly in the dense plantation), as widely reported (Doerr et al., \n\n1996; Keizer et al., 2008; Santos et al., 2013). Hydrophobicity is caused by organic \n\ncompounds, derived from living or decomposing plants or microorganisms, and it is \n\nintimately related with vegetation type due to exudate chemistry (e.g. Doerr et al., 2000). \n\nDifferent hydrophobic substances released by vegetation type may explain the greater \n\nresistance of hydrophobicity to break-down with rainfall events in eucalypt (greater in \n\ndense than open stands) than oak areas. This compounds type would also affect the time \n\nneeded for new hydrophobic compound input in order to re-establish hydrophobicity after \n\nwet periods (e.g. Doerr et al., 2000; Doerr and Thomas, 2000), which increased from oak \n\nto open and dense eucalypt sites. \n\nIn dense eucalypt stands of Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, hydrophobicity disappeared after 113 \n\nmm (period 11), whereas Ferreira et al. (2000) found hydrophobicity persisted after 200 \n\nmm rainfall in schist soils farther north in Portugal. Furthermore, the recorded increase \n\nin the extension and severity of hydrophobicity under eucalypt stands with soil depth \n\ncontrasts with the findings of Santos et al. (2013) in similar plantations in Portugal, \n\nthough on schist soils. The increase in and persistence of hydrophobicity with soil depth \n\nunder eucalypt stands can indicate that hydrophobic compounds are primarily released by \n\nroot activity (Dekker and Ritsema, 1994; Doerr et al., 1998). However, considering the \n\ndeepness of eucalypt roots, it is more plausible that hydrophobicity at 50-100 mm results \n\nfrom surface leaching compounds during storm events (Doerr et al., 2000). High surface \n\nhydrophobicity found at the eucalypt harvest site (ED1) could be due to eucalypt leaves \n\nand branches left on the ground, the breakdown of which would have led to hydrophobic \n\ncompounds (Doerr et al., 2000; Robinson et al., 2003; Zavala et al., 2009). In sparse \n\neucalypt site, hydrophobic conditions under abundant scrub cover, were also reported \n\nunder similar climatic conditions, 50 km from the study site (Stoof et al., 2011; Walsh et \n\nal., 2012). \n\nUnder the oak woodland, the observed low severity and persistence of hydrophobicity \n\naccord with the findings of Cerd\u00e0 and Doerr (2005) for Q. coccifera in south-eastern \n\nSpain. However, the similar hydrophobicity found between soil depths in Ribeira dos \n\nCov\u00f5es is in contrast to the progressive decrease described for oakwood soils in northeast \n\nSpain (Bad\u00eda et al., 2013). \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  \n\n \n\n99 \n\nThe recorded differences in soil hydrophobic properties between woodland types in \n\nRibeira dos Cov\u00f5es (dense eucalypt>sparse eucalypt>oak) may in part be linked to \n\nvegetation type and density, but could also be linked to soil texture differences. \n\nHydrophobicity is more frequently associated with coarse-textured soils, since coarse \n\nparticles are more susceptible to develop hydrophobicity due to a smaller surface area per \n\nunit volume compared with fine-textured soils (DeBano, 1991; Doerr et al., 2000; Cerd\u00e0 \n\nand Doerr, 2007; Mart\u00ednez-Zavala and Jord\u00e1n-L\u00f3pez, 2009; Gonz\u00e1lez-Pe\u00f1aloza et al., \n\n2013). This could enhance the hydrophobicity on the sandier eucalypt locations compared \n\nwith the loamy oak woodland sites. Although not common in clay-rich soils, the type of \n\nclay has been reported as important in hydrophobicity formation (DeBano, 2000; Diehl, \n\n2013; McKissock et al., 2002; Zavala et al., 2009).  \n\nReported relationships between hydrophobicity and soil organic matter have been very \n\ninconsistent, and some authors suggest that the kinds of organic matter compounds (e.g. \n\naliphatic and amphiphilic hydrocarbons structure, the presence of tannins, phenolic \n\ncompounds, lipids and the humic/fulvic acids proportion) are more important than the \n\namount (Doerr et al., 2000; Diehl, 2013; de Blas et al., 2010; McKissock et al., 2002; \n\nJord\u00e1n et al., 2013). According to Zavala et al. (2009), soil and vegetation parameters \n\nneed to be considered together. \n\nThe seasonal hydrophobicity pattern characterized by greater severity and spatial extent \n\nin dry periods, as well as lower under wet settings, has been widely reported (Dekker and \n\nRitsema, 1994; DeBano, 2000; Doerr et al., 2000; Santos et al., 2013) and is clearly linked \n\nto the antecedent rainfall pattern. The significant negative correlations found between \n\nhydrophobicity and antecedent rainfall were also recorded by Buczko et al. (2007), but \n\nnot by Santos et al. (2013) for other eucalypt sites in Portugal.  \n\n \n\n4.5.1.3. Soil moisture \n\nThe higher soil moisture content recorded under oak than in the two eucalypt stands may \n\nbe associated with higher water retention by the finer-textured soil overlying limestone \n\nbedrock compared with the coarser sandstone soils of the eucalypt areas, causing lower \n\npercolation (as unsaturated hydraulic conductivity results showed) and higher soil \n\nmoisture content. Soil texture has been reported to influence the spatial variability of soil \n\nmoisture particularly in wet conditions (Baroni et al., 2013). The higher soil moisture \n\ncontent under oak, however, could also be the result of: (1) more effective ponding by \n\nunderlying bedrock in the shallower soil (<0.4 m on limestone as opposed to >3 m in \n\nsandstone), as found elsewhere by Maeda et al. (2006), Hardie et al. (2012) and Yang et \n\nal. (2012); (2) the lower slope angles (13-22\u00ba as opposed to 16-26\u00ba and 26-28\u00ba in dense \n\nand sparse eucalypt plots), which gives more opportunity for infiltration and therefore \n\nincreased soil moisture as found elsewhere by Zhu and Lin (2011); (3) the lower position \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \u2013 DIFFERENCES IN OVERLAND FLOW DYNAMICS IN DIFFERENT TYPES \n\nOF WOODLAND AREAS WITHIN A PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT  \n\n \n\n100 \n\nof oak plots on the hillslope (Table 4.1), leading to more effective moisture accumulation \n\nand retention than upslope (Kim, 2009; Ridolfi et al., 2003); and (4) the presence of a few \n\nrelict stone walls in the oak woodland which may have increased water retention, as found \n\nelsewhere by Yang et al. (2012). \n\nIn addition to differences in soil properties and terrain characteristics, higher soil moisture \n\nunder oak than eucalypt sites may be linked to factors driven by vegetation, such as \n\ntranspiration and hydrophobicity (less intense and less frequent in oak woodland soil). \n\nEucalypt trees are usually associated with greatest water demand (Robinson et al., 2003; \n\nYang et al., 2012), leading to lower soil moisture content than oak woodland. Previous \n\nreports from Portugal, showed that daily transpiration from a mature Eucalyptus globulus \n\nLabill. stand varied between 0.5 and 3.6 mm day-1 during a spring-summer period (David \n\net al., 1997). In south-eastern Australia, Forrester et al. (2010) reported a transpiration \n\nincrease of eucalyptus plantations from 0.4 mm day?1 at age 2 years to a peak of about \n\n1.6\u20131.9 mm day?1 in stands aged 5\u20137 years. Lower transpiration was reported in Quercus \n\nilex L., in Catalonia, NE Spain, which ranged from 464 mm year-1 and 453 mm year-1 in \n\nvalley and ridge-top locations of a forest catchment, respectively (Sala and Tenhunen, \n\n1996).  \n\nIn Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, the higher soil moisture content in oak than eucalypt stands, \n\nhowever, does not seem to result from greater water consumption by eucalypt trees, since \n\nno significant difference in soil moisture was found between dense and sparse eucalypt \n\nstands. Nevertheless, the high evapotranspiration rate of extensive scrub cover can be \n\nsimilar to that of eucalypt trees (Bellot et al., 2004; H\u00fcmann et al., 2011; Yang et al., \n\n2012), which could lead to the absence of significant soil moisture differences in distinct \n\neucalypt stands. The high evapotranspiration provided by the scrub cover may also \n\ncounterbalance the higher soil water retention expected at the sparse than dense eucalypt \n\nstands, due to higher silt and clay contents (Table 4.1). \n\nHarvesting (DE1) and thinning (O3) performed in wet periods seemed to enhance soil \n\nmoisture content, as a result of higher throughfall. Nevertheless, lower soil moisture \n\ncontent would be expected if harvesting was performed in dry weather, because of higher \n\nexposure to insolation (Ferreira, 1996; Scherer and Pike, 2003; Vernimmen et al., 2007; \n\nEnsenbies et al., 2007). The litter layer also intercepts incoming radiation, reducing soil \n\nevaporation and increasing water retention capacity (Og\u00e9e and Brunet, 2002; Matthews, \n\n2005; Savva et al., 2013). Greater litter thickness and lower soil bulk density may explain \n\ngreater soil moisture content at the O2 plot compared with O1 and O3 plots. Differences \n\nin the litter layer could have masked the effect of different tree densities in the eucalypt \n\nareas. \n\nSurface soil moisture content seemed to be strongly associated with hydrophobicity \n\npattern. Generally, soil moisture was low when hydrophobicity was most severe and high \n\nwhen hydrophobicity was weak or absent. Soil hydrophobicity blocks water infiltration, \n\nwhich is usually restricted to preferential pathways provided by root holes and burrows, \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  \n\n \n\n101 \n\nchannels, cracks and stones (Urbanek and Shakesby, 2009; Wang et al., 2013). Such \n\npatchy infiltration leads to a heterogeneous soil moisture distribution (Dekker and \n\nRitsema, 1994; DeBano, 2000; Doerr et al., 2000; Tumer et al., 2005). Stronger \n\npersistence of hydrophobicity under dense eucalypt stand could have led to a lower soil \n\nmoisture content compared with the sparse eucalypt site, as well as lowest values under \n\noak woodland. \n\nIn Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, hydrophobicity was absent above soil moisture contents of 33, 21 \n\nand 32% in dense eucalypt, sparse eucalypt and oak woodland, respectively (Figure 4.9). \n\nSimilarly, extreme hydrophobicity was not recorded for soil moistures above 26, 18 and \n\n21%, respectively, reinforcing the view of the highly resilient nature of hydrophobicity \n\nin dense eucalypt plantations. Differences in the critical moisture content for the existence \n\nof hydrophobicity between woodland types may be linked to variations in soil texture \n\n(Doerr et al., 2000) and soil organic matter (Tumer et al., 2005; Jord\u00e1n et al., 2013), where \n\nthe latter may be linked to species of trees and understorey vegetation. Previous studies \n\nhave reported hydrophobicity for soil moisture contents of up to 22% in sandy loam soils \n\n(Doerr and Thomas, 2000), and as high as 38% in clayey soils (Dekker and Ritsema, \n\n1994). Under eucalypt plantations in central Portugal, Santos et al. (2013) reported the \n\ndominance of strong and extreme hydrophobicity in schist soils when soil moisture \n\ncontent was below 14%, which is lower than for the Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es findings.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.9 - Average soil moisture variability within hydrophobicity classes (1: wettable, 2: low, \n\n3: moderate, 4: severe and 5: extreme hydrophobicity) for different forest types. \n\n \n\nTemporal pattern of surface soil moisture was affected by variation in rainfall, as reported \n\nin previous studies (Bellot et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2012), as well as throughfall, as \n\nobserved by Ferreira et al. (2000). However, no correlation between throughfall and soil \n\nmoisture was identified by Shachnovich et al.

Overland flow \n\nRunoff plots installed in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es recorded very low overland flow coefficients \n\n(<3%) in woodland sites. Generally, vegetation enhances infiltration, particularly in tree \n\nstands because of their comparatively deep root systems (Calvo-Cases et al., 2003; \n\nH\u00fcmann et al., 2011; Komatsu et al., 2011). Nevertheless, the underlying bedrock can \n\nhave an important effect on slope hydrology, particularly influencing infiltration and \n\noverland flow (Hattanji and Onda, 2004; Zhang and Hiscock, 2010). Generally, coarse-\n\ntextured soils associated with sandstone are usually highly permeable, allowing water to \n\ndrain freely. High permeability of limestone soils has been also widely reported in areas \n\nof Mediterranean climate (e.g. Calvo-Cases et al., 2003; Cerd\u00e0, 1997). Although bedrock \n\ndifferences in the study catchment may mask the influence of woodland type, significant \n\noverland flow differences were found between dense and sparse eucalypt despite both \n\nbeing on sandstone, and no significant overland flow difference was identified between \n\nsparse eucalypt and oak stands, despite the latter overlying limestone. Spatio-temporal \n\nvariation in overland flow pattern between woodland types is thought instead to be a \n\nconsequence of hydrophobicity differences, since no significant throughfall difference \n\nwas found between woodland stands, and soil moisture was higher in oak soils, where \n\noverland flow was lower. \n\nIn storm events following dry weather, the most likely cause of overland flow seemed to \n\nbe infiltration-excess caused by hydrophobic soils. Infiltration-excess overland flow \n\nunder hydrophobic conditions have been widely reported (e.g. DeBano 2000; Doerr et al., \n\n2000; H\u00fcmann et al, 2011). Thus the greater severity of hydrophobicity in the dense \n\neucalypt plantation is considered to be the reason for its greater overland flow (Figure \n\n4.10), especially in larger rainstorms. In the sparse eucalypt stand, the moderate or severe \n\nand patchier hydrophobicity broke down more easily as a result of rainfall (see section \n\n4.4.3.2), thereby explaining the lower overland flow than in the dense eucalypt \n\nplantations. Nevertheless, smaller rainfall events (3.7 mm and 9.5 mm in period 23 and \n\n25) failed to break down soil hydrophobicity in the sparse eucalyptus (Figure 4.6), which \n\nmay explain the higher percentage overland recorded in those periods (Figure 4.8). In oak \n\nwoodland, the low or moderate hydrophobicity and its much patchier nature would \n\nexplain why infiltration-excess overland flow responses were very small even after \n\nprolonged dry weather. Differences in the breakdown resistance of hydrophobic \n\nproperties may be the reason for a stronger correlation between overland flow and rainfall \n\nin dense eucalypt plantation than in the other woodland types (see section 4.4.3.4).  \n\n \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  \n\n \n\n103 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.10 - Variation of overland flow coefficient according with surface hydrophobicity (1: \n\nwettable, 2: low, 3: moderate, 4: severe and 5: extreme hydrophobicity) for different monitored \n\nplots. \n\nEven under extreme hydrophobic conditions, however, overland flow was minor. Thus, \n\nthe maximum runoff coefficient in dense eucalypt plantations never exceeded 2.2%. This \n\npeak runoff is lower than the maximum of 10% measured in similar experimental plots \n\nunder similar eucalypt stands in north-central Portugal following a long dry season, \n\nthough for schist soils (Ferreira et al., 2000). The low overland flow under extreme \n\nhydrophobicity indicates the role of water sinks within the woodland soils. Given the \n\nrelatively low soil moisture content in hydrophobic soils, infiltration would seem to \n\noccur: (1) in hydrophilic soil patches, linked to a discontinuous hydrophobic layer, \n\nparticularly under oak and sparse eucalypt stands (Figure 4.6); and (2) via preferential \n\nflow routes provided by cracks and root holes, although stones in sufficient quantities \n\nmay also promote infiltration (Urbanek and Shakesby, 2009). Several authors have \n\nreported the relevance of preferential flow patterns for water infiltration in hydrophobic \n\nsoils (DeBano, 2000; Doerr et al., 2000; Buczo et al., 2006). In hydrophobic sandy and \n\nsandy loam soils elsewhere, >80% (Ritsema et al., 1997) and 86-99% (Tsukamoto and \n\nOhta, 1988) of water movement has been attributed to preferential flow.   \n\nLimited overland flow under antecedent dry settings may be also associated with surface \n\nwater retention, favoured by vegetation and litter, as well as micro-topographic \n\nconcavities on hillslopes. Under these conditions, rainfall may stop before surface \n\ndepressions had been filled. The longer concentration time required for continuous flow \n\non long hillslopes compared with the duration of the most effective rain showers was \n\nstated by Yair and Raz-Yassif (2004) as the cause of the low efficiency of runoff \n\nprocesses on slopes.  \n\nIn wet conditions, particularly in the dense eucalypt plots, it was unclear whether overland \n\nflow was promoted by hydrophobicity-linked infiltration-excess and/or saturation-excess \n\nmechanisms. The persistence of subsurface hydrophobicity, in combination with a thin \n\nhydrophilic soil layer, may prevent downward water flux through the soil matrix (Doerr \n\net al., 2000).

Under these conditions, ponded water in the surface saturated \n\nlayer may be diverted laterally as subsurface lateral flow unless encountering a vertical \n\npreferential flow path, allowing it to reach soil at greater depth and perhaps enter the \n\nunderlying rock.  \n\nDuring the wettest conditions, overland flow appears to be generated by saturation-excess \n\nin the sparse eucalypt and, particularly, oak woodland types, as the soils were hydrophilic \n\nrather than hydrophobic. In the sparse eucalypt stand, generation of saturation-excess \n\noverland flow may also have been favoured by greater bulk density and clay content of \n\nits soil (Table 4.1), and its steeper slopes (26-28\u00ba), as found elsewhere by Neris et al. \n\n(2013). Saturation overland flow was greatest in large rainfall events, when water \n\ndetention by the surface micro-topography is exceeded leading to a greater downhill flux \n\nconnectivity to develop (Yang et al., 2012). Surface topography may also enhance \n\noverland flow connectivity via local rills. Thus it was observed that during this study, a \n\nrill developed on plot SE3 creating a preferential surface path for overland flow, which \n\nmay account for the significantly greater overland flow in that plot compared with in plots \n\nSE1 and SE2 (see section 4.4.3.4). \n\nIn the oak woodland, generation of saturation overland flow may have been favoured by \n\nthe loamier and also shallower soil than in the eucalypt plantations (Table 4.1). These will \n\nenhanced ponding and lead to subsurface lateral flow, which was observed while digging \n\nthe holes for the overland flow tanks at the O2 and O3 oak plots. Previous researchers \n\nhave also remarked on the contribution of lateral subsurface flow in lower hillslope \n\npositions in view of the high soil moisture content after rainfall (Gautam et al., 2000; \n\nRidolfi et al., 2003; G\u00fcntner and Bronstert, 2004). According to Lorz et al. (2007), \n\nsubsurface water flow paths prevail where there is a uniform forest cover. The lack of \n\nwater ponding where the pit for the collecting tank for plot O1 was excavated, may \n\nindicate deeper subsurface lateral flow associated with locally deeper soil, since this plot \n\nwas installed a few metres downslope and at some lateral distance from the other plots. \n\nThe impact of spatially heterogeneous distributions of soil thickness on rainfall\u2013runoff \n\nprocesses was also reported elsewhere (e.g. Maeda et al., 2006).   \n\nNevertheless, based on minor overland flow events during the study, the dominance of \n\ninfiltration and/or subsurface lateral flow is evident. Even with high soil moisture content, \n\nplots showed an elevated permeability on limestone soil. Owing to high soil permeability, \n\nno seasonal variation was identified in overland flow measured on plot O1. However, \n\nsince overland flow generated on plots O2 and O3 was affected by subsurface soil \n\nsaturation and lateral flow, temporal differences were identified. The oak woodland \n\nresults accord with the high infiltration capacities of limestone soils under Mediterranean \n\nclimate reported in previous studies (Cerd\u00e0, 1997; Calvo-Cases et al., 2003). \n\nLower overland flow in oak compared with eucalypt sites could be also favoured by lower \n\nslope gradients (Table 4.1), despite no significant correlation being observed. A lower \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  \n\n \n\n105 \n\nslope angle on plot O1 may have led to minor overland flow than the other runoff plots \n\ninstalled under oak stand (cumulative overland flow over the study period was 1.9 mm, \n\n4.3 mm and 3.2 mm for plots O1, O2 and O3, respectivelly). On steep slopes, overland \n\nflow tend to increase due to the shorter residence time for water on the soil and reduced \n\neffectiveness of surface roughness in retaining water (Ferreira et al., 2012; Neris et al., \n\n2013). This can be particularly important throughout, or immediately after, large rainfall \n\nevents, when surface microtopography exceeds water retention capacity, leading to \n\nincrease downhill flux connectivity (e.g. Yang et al., 2012). Topography has been \n\nconsidered the controlling factor on lateral flow only in wet conditions (Lv et al., 2013; \n\nRidolfi et al., 2003). \n\nForest management activities can also affect overland flow generation. Under dense \n\neucalypt plantation, plot DE1 had its highest runoff coefficient immediately after clear-\n\nfelling. Such increases in overland flow and stream peakflows after logging have been \n\nwidely reported elsewhere, where they have been linked to reduced infiltration capacities \n\ndue to ground disturbance and soil compaction (Ferreira et al., 2000; Eisenbies et al., \n\n2007; Robinson et al., 2003). In south-central Japan, partial plot thinning (43%) of a \n\nJapanese cypress forest led to an increase in runoff coefficient from 33 to 56% (Dung et \n\nal., 2012). At the catchment scale, Calder (1993) calculated a runoff increase of 3.3 mm \n\nfor each percent of an area deforested, based on a world-wide database of hydrologic \n\nstudies. Based on 94 experimental catchments throughout the world, Bosh and Hewlett \n\n(1982) estimated that partial tree thinning (by 20%) led to changes in annual streamflow \n\nincrease lower than 10% in hardwoods and than 20% in scrub areas. Nonetheless, some \n\nstudies have pointed out that such changes in catchment discharge are unlikely to be \n\ndetected if the area affected constitutes less than 20-30% of the total forest cover (Scherer \n\nand Pike, 2003; Bathurst et al., 2011).  \n\nIn Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, the fact that overland flow after clear-felling was not higher than \n\n2.3% may be due to the thick ground cover of leaves, bark and small branches left in the \n\nharvested plot DE1, which would have enhanced water retention capacity and minimized \n\nany reduction in infiltration capacity due to splash effects. The enhancement of overland \n\nflow in DE1 was quickly reduced, first because of low rainfall in spring and summer and \n\nsecondly with rapid regeneration of vegetation after September 2012, in response to the \n\nonset of the rainy late autumn-winter season. The timing of clear-felling may be a \n\ndetermining factor in overland flow impact, since felling performed during spring allows \n\nvegetation to regenerate before autumn rains, minimizing overland flow impacts, \n\ncompared with late summer or autumn felling. \n\nIn oak woodland, canopy cover reduction in plot O3 (between periods 48 and 49) did not \n\naffect overland flow generation, which indicates the minor influence of vegetation on \n\noverland flow under wet conditions. Nevertheless, the removal of much of the canopy \n\nnear the upper plot boundary, although not leading to increased overland flow,  resulted \n\nin much water being retained in surface depressions and not reaching the plot outlet. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \u2013 DIFFERENCES IN OVERLAND FLOW DYNAMICS IN DIFFERENT TYPES \n\nOF WOODLAND AREAS WITHIN A PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT  \n\n \n\n106 \n\n4.5.2. Potential implications for catchment streamflow  \n\nThe low overland flow recorded in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es over 2-year period supports the \n\nwidespread notion of high soil permeability associated with forest vegetation. \n\nNevertheless, different woodland types have distinct effects on overland flow amount and \n\non its temporal pattern. Dense eucalypt plantations are less suitable as a tree cover to \n\nencourage infiltration than sparse eucalypt and oak stands, as a result of great severity \n\nand resistance of soil hydrophobicity. However, the minor overland flow generated even \n\nunder extreme soil hydrophobicity highlights the dominance of vertical water fluxes, \n\nfavoured by preferential flow pathways. In oak woodland, and to a lesser extent in the \n\nsparse eucalypt stand, overland flow is mostly produced in prolonged rainfall events \n\nduring wet weather conditions.  \n\nBased on Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es results, it is arguable that dense eucalypt plantations would \n\nbe most likely to contribute to flash floods during extreme storms that occur immediately \n\nafter the summer, due to infiltration-excess overland flow favoured by greater severity \n\nand spatial cover of hydrophobicity. On the other hand, sparse eucalypt stands and \n\nparticularly oak woodland, would contribute to large-scale floods mostly in wettest \n\nconditions, since overland flow in those forest types is typically produced by saturation-\n\nexcess mechanisms. Nevertheless, even under saturated conditions, water interaction with \n\nthe canopies, litter layers and enhanced surface roughness of woodland and forest areas \n\nmay delay overland flow, slowing its transport down a hillslope thus lengthening the lag \n\ntime and reducing the peak discharge in the stream network (Eisenbies et al., 2007; \n\nHewlett, 1982). \n\nOn 25th October 2006, a rainfall event at Coimbra-Bencanta of 102 mm after a long dry \n\nsummer, led to a flash flood in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment. According to Brand\u00e3o et \n\nal. (2001), rainfall events of 94 mm day-1 and 112 mm day-1 at Coimbra have return \n\nperiods of 10- and 50-years, respectively. Although the contribution from woodland areas \n\nto this flood is unknown, based on overland flow measurements performed under local \n\nwoodland, dense eucalypt plantations could have some contribution to this flood, whereas \n\nsparse eucalypt and oak sites could provide upstream overland flow sinks.  \n\nNevertheless, the overland flow measurements undertaken in this study were conducted \n\nat a plot scale. It is known, however, that overland flow responses tend to diminish with \n\nincreasing contributing area (van de Giesen et al., 2000; van de Giesen et al., 2005; \n\nFerreira et al., 2011; Chamizo et al., 2012). For example, van de Giesen et al. (2005) \n\nrecorded a decrease of 40\u201375% in overland flow from short (1.25 m) to long plots (12 m).  \n\nOn the other hand, Mounirou et al. (2012) reported similar runoff amounts from 50 and \n\n150 m2 plots, though both were significantly lower than the smallest plot (1 m2) used. \n\nCerdan et al. (2004), in turn, observed a strong decrease in mean runoff coefficients with \n\nincreasing area in studies performed at larger scales: three times lower for 90 ha than 450 \n\nm2, and ten times for 1100 ha than 90 ha. In an experimental study, Chamizo et al. (2012) \n\nfound an optimal plot length of 20 m to determine runoff representative of a catchment.  \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  \n\n \n\n107 \n\nDecreasing overland flow with increasing slope length is usually explained with greater \n\nopportunity for water infiltration on long than on short slopes (van de Giesen et al., 2005). \n\nIt has also been attributed to increased soil heterogeneity within larger area, in terms of \n\ngreater spatial variability in soil infiltration capacity (Cerdan et al., 2004; Mounirou et \n\nal., 2012), wettable patches and macropores, which can act as sinks for water (Calvo-\n\nCases et al., 2003; G\u00fcntner and Bronstert, 2004; Nasta et al., 2009), as well as the \n\ntemporal dynamics of the rainfall\u2013runoff events (van de Giesen et al., 2005). These spots \n\nwith enhancing infiltration capacity can provide important overland flow sinks, breaking \n\nflow connectivity (Calvo-Cases et al., 2003; G\u00fcntner and Bronstert, 2004; Nasta et al., \n\n2009). In addition, the relatively little overland flow tends to be trapped by vegetation \n\nand litter and retained in microtopographic concavities on the hillslope. However, flow \n\nconnectivity may be enhanced by rill development, as observed in plot SE2.  \n\nNevertheless, some authors have argued that spatial variability only has a scale-related \n\neffect on total runoff during relatively short rainfall events (van de Giesen et al., 2005; \n\nMounirou et al., 2012). In Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, considering the discontinuous pattern of \n\nthe rainfall and the small amounts of overland flow generated under woodland land-use, \n\nthe generation of sufficiently continuous overland flow able to reach valley floors and \n\nchannels would be rare, particularly under dry conditions. This was particularly obvious \n\nat the sparse eucalypt site, where overland flow under dry conditions was mostly \n\ngenerated by lower rainfall events. Under these conditions, rainfall stopped before surface \n\ndepressions had been filled. Thus, much overland flow generated on upper slopes is \n\nretained and/or infiltrated somewhere downslope, thus never reaches the channel. The \n\nlonger concentration time required for continuous flow on long hillslopes compared with \n\nthe duration of most effective rain showers was also stated by Yair and Raz-Yassif (2004) \n\nas the cause for the low efficiency of runoff processes on slopes. Nevertheless, with \n\ncontinuous rainfall, surface depressions may eventually reach saturation, leading to a \n\ncontinuous flow transferred downslope. Under these conditions, field measurements \n\nshowed larger overland flow amounts (particularly in late winter and spring seasons of \n\n2013). However, stone walls, even when small as in this study, present barriers to \n\noverland flow delivery, limiting significantly the amount of overland flow reaching the \n\nvalley floor.  \n\nPrevious studies also have been reporting that slopes behave as a mosaic of runoff \n\ngeneration and run-on patches, whose size depends on slope morphometric \n\ncharacteristics, lithology, differences in soil thicknesses and climate (Calvo-Cases et al., \n\n2003; Ridolfi et al., 2003; G\u00fcntner and Bronstert, 2004; Komatsu et al., 2011; Lorz et al., \n\n2007). These variables control the hydrological discontinuity between different parts of \n\nthe same slope and between slopes, channel network and catchment outlet. The scale \n\neffect is of the utmost importance in this process due to the size of the contributing area \n\nand the number of opportunities for water infiltration and retention (Merz and B\u00e1rdossy, \n\n1998; G\u00fcntner and Bronstert, 2004). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \u2013 DIFFERENCES IN OVERLAND FLOW DYNAMICS IN DIFFERENT TYPES \n\nOF WOODLAND AREAS WITHIN A PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT  \n\n \n\n108 \n\nVegetation intercepts and detains water within the canopy delaying or preventing some \n\nof it from reaching the ground. Vegetation, and particularly trees, can mitigate peak flow \n\nby maintaining soil moisture deficit through evapotranspiration over days or weeks, \n\nthereby resulting in increased potential for soil storage and infiltration capacity during \n\nfrequent, relatively low intensity storms (Eisenbies et al., 2007). Although the minor \n\noverland flow measured in the woodland areas of Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment supports \n\nthe protective role of forest land-use during storm events, the highest daily rainfall in the \n\nmonitoring period was only 48 mm, which does not exceed a 2-year return period \n\n(Brand\u00e3o et al., 2001). Overland flow responses in more extreme events can only be \n\nsurmised. It is clearly possible that in such extreme events overland flow from woodland \n\nareas will be much greater and will also more readily be transferred to downslope areas, \n\nsince interception by vegetation and surface water retention capacities provided by litter \n\nand micro-topographic concavities will be exceeded. Thus, some studies have \n\nemphasized the limited storage capacity of forested terrain during larger storms and its \n\nminor role in flood protection (Bathurst et al., 2011; Eisenbies et al., 2007). Nevertheless, \n\neven under saturated conditions, forest floor roughness represents a barrier for overland \n\nflow passage.       \n\nThe role of woodland type on flood events, however, clearly needs further investigation. \n\nAdditional monitoring in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es would need to be carried out in order to \n\nmonitor larger storm events and improve understanding of the role of woodland on \n\noverland flow under these conditions. Furthermore, the impact of woodland types on \n\noverland flow should also be performed at a larger scale, in order to understand its \n\ninfluence on catchment scale. In Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, streamflow measurements have \n\nbeen carried to assess the role of woodland areas at the sub-catchment scale. This \n\ninformation would be particularly important for mixed land-use catchments.   \n\nWoodland is the dominant land-use in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment, followed by urban \n\nsurfaces, which in some places interrupts woodland patches. Urbanization in recent years \n\nseems to have promoted increased catchment discharge, which is expected to continue in \n\nview of the character of future urban development already approved (Ferreira et al., \n\n2013). Considering the small amount of overland flow generated in local woodland, this \n\nland-use can provide potential overland flow sinks for such flow emanating from upslope \n\nimpermeable urban areas. A discontinuous pattern of urban and woodland land-uses can \n\ninterrupt flow connectivity over the landscape and minimize the detrimental hydrological \n\nimpacts of urbanization (Ferreira et al., 2015). Nevertheless, the infiltration of urban \n\nsurface runoff through preferential flow routes, particularly under woodland areas, \n\nespecially under dry settings when soil hydrophobicity is widespread, may represent a \n\nproblem for groundwater contamination (Selker et al., 1996; Pitt et al., 1999).  \n\nFurthermore, forestry management activities can also play an important role on overland \n\nflow and influence the role of woodland areas on flood protection. Timber harvesting may \n\nenhance overland flow due to the higher throughfall, decreased evapotranspiration and \n\nlower resistance to water run-on promoted by vegetation removal, and soil compaction \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  \n\n \n\n109 \n\ncaused by heavy machinery (Scherer and Pike, 2003). Nevertheless, results from Ribeira \n\ndos Cov\u00f5es showed no significant change in overland flow with total or partial plot \n\nharvesting (ED1 and O3), but increased overland flow coefficients were attained \n\nimmediately after harvesting. This was attributed to the retention of logging slash on the \n\nsoil, which can enhance surface detention. The importance of logging slash in harvested \n\nareas for interception has also been noted by other researchers (e.g. Shakesby et al., 2013; \n\nRobinson et al., 2003; Prats, 2013). Small areas covered would generate little overland \n\nflow, particularly if harvesting is carried out on upper hillslopes. On the other hand, large \n\nclear-felled areas would provide high quantities of overland flow that might reach the \n\nchannel. Chang (2003) reported that small canopy openings on upper slopes can cause a \n\nsmaller impact on water yield than when they occur on lower slopes. Some studies, \n\nhowever, have pointed out that changes in catchment discharge are unlikely to be detected \n\nif the area affected is&lt;20-30% of the total forest cover (Scherer and Pike, 2003: Bathurst \n\net al., 2011). In a review by Eisenbies et al. (2007), studies are cited where a harvesting \n\nimpact on stormflow was only significant at relatively low volumes (0.1-1 mm) and others \n\nwhere no differences were observed for stormflows >10 mm. Calder et al. (1992) \n\ncalculated a runoff increase of 3.3 mm for each percent of area deforested, based on a \n\nworld-wide database of hydrologic studies.  \n\nDespite the impact of harvesting on overland flow was not an original objective of this \n\nstudy, the results from plots DE1 and O3 suggest that the impact of clear-felling on \n\noverland flow depends on its timing. Harvesting performed during spring and summer \n\nallows vegetation to regenerate before autumn rains, minimizing overland flow impacts, \n\ncompared with autumn harvesting, given the size and frequency of rainfall events. \n\nIn Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, woodland is the most dominant land-use, followed by urban areas, \n\nsome of them located upslope. Urbanization in recent years seems to have promoted \n\nincreased catchment discharge, and this is expected to continue in future taking into \n\naccount the character of urban development already approved (Ferreira et al., 2013). \n\nConsidering the greater overland flow generated in urban areas (e.g. Mulliss et al., 1996; \n\nKonrad and Booth, 2002; Huang et al., 2008) and the high infiltration capacities of \n\nwoodland, this land-use may provide sinks for overland flow generated in comparatively \n\nimpermeable urban areas. The flow disconnectivity provided by a mosaic of different \n\nland-uses may minimize the detrimental hydrological impacts of urbanization (Ferreira et \n\nal., 2012d) and enhance the safety of the resident population downslope of woodland \n\nareas, at least during small and average storm events.  \n\nDespite woodland capacity to generate limited overland flow and to provide potential \n\noverland flow sinks from upslope land-uses, it is also prone to contribute into catchment \n\nstreamflow. Through dry settings, widespread hydrophobicity, particularly dense \n\neucalypt areas due to great severity and resistance of switching to hydrophilic properties, \n\nhas led to increased overland flow and could contribute to flash floods. In wet weather \n\nconditions, long-lasting rainfall events during saturated soil conditions, particularly in \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \u2013 DIFFERENCES IN OVERLAND FLOW DYNAMICS IN DIFFERENT TYPES \n\nOF WOODLAND AREAS WITHIN A PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT  \n\n \n\n110 \n\noak woodland areas, enhance overland flow and can contribute to large-scale floods. \n\nAnyway, woodland areas may slow down overland flow due to great surface roughness \n\nand thus lengthen the lag time and reduce peak discharge in stream network. Usually \n\nwoodland and forest streams have a delayed response time because of water interactions \n\nwith the canopy, litter layer and increased surface roughness, in addition to any influence \n\nof soils and topography (Hewlett, 1982; Eisenbies et al., 2007).  \n\nThe importance of sustainable management of forest areas in retaining and reducing \n\noverland flow may be important to protect downslope urban areas. The understanding of \n\nseasonal variability of overland flow and its spatial distribution as a result of soil \n\nproperties, topographic position and geographic location in catchment, in particular \n\nwithin wooded areas, is of the utmost importance to identify landscape sinks and sources. \n\nThis information is crucial for integrated planning and management of catchments \n\nundergoing urban development, to minimize hydrologic impacts. Further investigation \n\nshould be carried out in order to improve understanding of the appropriate sizes and \n\nlocations of woodland areas within peri-urban catchments, in order to minimize the \n\nhydrologic impacts of urbanization and protect downslope urban cores from flood hazard.  \n\n \n\n4.6. Conclusions \n\nIn the urbanizing catchment of Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es in central Portugal, permeable \n\nwoodland soils on sandstone and limestone produced overland flow representing less than \n\n3% of the incident rainfall, based on measurements performed on small (16 m2) plots over \n\n2 years of monitoring. A dense eucalypt stand generated significantly higher overland \n\nflow than either sparse eucalypt or oak woodlands, which differed only slightly. Although \n\nthe underlying bedrock can also influence hydrological processes, woodland type appears \n\nto be far more important, given the differences in soil hydrological properties and \n\noverland flow generation recorded on dense and sparse eucalypt stands, as they are both \n\nlocated on sandstone.  \n\nIn dry conditions, hydrophobicity-linked infiltration-excess overland flow was the \n\ndominant means of downslope water movement. This process was particularly important \n\nin dense eucalypt plantations, where hydrophobicity was more extreme, spatially \n\ncontiguous and resistant to breakdown with rainfall than was the case in the other two \n\nwoodland types. Under hydrophobic conditions, overland flow strongly increased with \n\nrainfall amount and intensity, but overland flow coefficient did not exceed 2.2%. In \n\ncontrast, in the sparse eucalypt plots, moderate hydrophobicity was easily broken down, \n\nand percentage overland flow was greatest in smaller rainfall events (overland flow \n\ncoefficient&lt;0.5%), when the soil was not rendered wettable. The weak hydrophobic \n\nproperties observed in oak woodland plots led to a maximum overland flow coefficient \n\nof 0.4% in storms following dry antecedent weather. \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  \n\n \n\n111 \n\nIn periods of wet weather, saturation overland flow occurred most readily in oak \n\nwoodland followed by sparse eucalypt stands. Relatively high soil moisture contents \n\nmaintained throughout wet periods enhanced overland flow by saturation, so that runoff \n\ncoefficients reached 1.2% and 2.2% on the sparse eucalypt and oak woodland plots, \n\nrespectively. On the latter, saturation was favoured by the shallow soil overlying \n\nlimestone, its loamy texture and subsurface lateral flow, whereas in sparse eucalypt stand, \n\nsaturation was favoured by the high bulk density and clayey nature of the soil. In both \n\nwoodland types, overland flow strongly increased with rainfall amount and soil moisture. \n\nIn the dense eucalypt plantation, overland flow did not exceed 1.0% of the rainfall in wet \n\nweather.  \n\nInterception by the different tree canopies was not significantly different. It is thought to \n\nhave been important in reducing overland flow responses only during small rainfall events \n\nfollowing antecedent dry weather, as interception was low in percentage terms during \n\nlarge events and wet periods due to canopy saturation. In addition, surface roughness, \n\nassociated with the litter layer promoted water retention and decreased lateral flow \n\nconnectivity.   \n\nImportant implications of this study for managing peri-urban catchments are that patches \n\nof semi-natural and managed woodland are critical in order to retain rainfall, promote \n\ninfiltration and act as sinks for overland flow from upslope. In urbanized catchments, the \n\nlack of rainfall interception and the size, and often contiguity, of areas covered by \n\nimpermeable surfaces tend to promote rapid overland flow and the possibility of flooding. \n\nAuthorities concerned with catchment management and urban planning, therefore, should \n\ntry to incorporate such patches in any development proposal in order to reduce the total \n\nrunoff-generating area and provide sinks for runoff generated on impermeable urban \n\nsurfaces upslope. Thus, the most satisfactory compromise is likely to be a mosaic of \n\ndiverse land-uses designed to disrupt overland flow connectivity. Identifying the best \n\narrangement of such patches while maximizing the use of land for urban development \n\nshould now be a research priority. A second research need is for field data on overland \n\nflow responses within this mosaic in more extreme, potentially flood-producing \n\nrainstorms than occurred within the 2-year monitoring period of this study. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \u2013 DIFFERENCES IN OVERLAND FLOW DYNAMICS IN DIFFERENT TYPES \n\nOF WOODLAND AREAS WITHIN A PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT  \n\n \n\n112 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n113 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 5  \n\nINFLUENCE OF THE URBANIZATION PATTERN ON \n\nSTREAMFLOW OF A PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT \n\nUNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE \n\n5.1.

In order to understand better the impacts \n\non peak flows and in the response and recession times of the storm hydrograph, a \n\nmonitoring network was installed in a small peri-urban catchment (620 ha) located in \n\nCoimbra, central Portugal. The network comprised five rainfall gauges and eight water \n\nlevel recorders, in order to provide information on the hydrological response to \n\nrainstorms of catchments and sub-catchments of different size and urban patterns \n\n(extension, impervious surface cover, distance to the stream network and water \n\nmanagement strategies), overlying either sandstone or limestone areas. The results \n\nshowed both the importance of weather, season and lithology on catchment \n\nhydrological response and the increase of runoff coefficients with percentage urban \n\narea. However, urban areas located closer to the stream network showed higher \n\ncontributions to the streamflow due to lower water infiltration opportunities. This \n\nincluded greater peak flows and lower response times, especially where the storm \n\ndrainage system diverts the overland flow from impervious areas directly to the stream \n\nor nearby soils. However, some urban features (e.g. houses and walls constructed in \n\nvalley bottoms) may provide surface water retention, breaking the connectivity \n\nbetween hillslope urban surfaces and the stream network. In contrast, continuous \n\nurbanization enhances overland flow and streamflow peaks, though may be reduced \n\nthrough adopting particular land-use pattern and urbanization style, in order to enhance \n\nwater infiltration opportunities. Hydrological monitoring of peri-urban areas can \n\nprovide crucial information to develop planning strategies that improve the \n\nhydrological sustainability of urban areas and minimize the flood hazard. \n\n \n\nKeywords: urban areas, runoff, peak flow, flow connectivity, storm drainage system \n\n \n\n \n\n5.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \u2013 INFLUENCE OF THE URBANIZATION PATTERN ON STREAMFLOW OF A \n\nPERI-URBAN CATCHMENT UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE \n\n \n\n116 \n\n5.1. Introduction \n\nThe proportion of urban residents across the globe increased from 29% to 47% between \n\n1950 and 2000, and are forecasted to reach 56% by 2020 (UNESCO, 2006) and 70% by \n\n2050 (UNPD, 2008). In Europe, urban population attained 75% in 2006, and is expected \n\nto increase to 80% by 2020 (EEA, 2006). Nevertheless, the lower living costs, easy \n\nmobility/transport and the demand for improved quality of life, have been leading people \n\nto move outside the city to peri-urban areas (Ravetz et al., 2013). It has been been argued \n\nthat peri-urban areas, comprising a mixture of natural forest or agricultural lands and \n\nurbanized areas, usually with less than 20000 inhabitants, with an average density of at \n\nleast 40 persons per km2, may become the dominant urban form of the twenty-first century \n\n(Braud et al., 2013; Ravetz et al., 2013).  \n\nUrbanization involves radical changes to the environment, including hydrological \n\nprocesses. These impacts have been studied through statistical analysis of long data \n\nrecords, monitoring of paired catchments (similar catchments with different land-uses) \n\nand by predicting changes through modelling. Results report decreased \n\nevapotranspiration and infiltration, as well as increased runoff (e.g. Kundzewicz, 2008; \n\nYing et al., 2009; Kalantari et al., 2014). These lead to hydrograph shape changes, linked \n\nto greater peak discharge (e.g. Semadeni-Davies et al., 2008), reduced time of \n\nconcentration and recession period (Graf, 1977; Baker et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2008) \n\nand lower baseflow (e.g. Simmons and Reynolds, 1982; Konrad and Booth, 2005; \n\nWheater and Evans, 2009). These lead to increased magnitude and frequency of floods \n\n(Moscrip and Montgomery, 1997; Burns et al. 2005; Haase, 2009) and shorten recurrence \n\nintervals on urban streamflow (e.g. Hollis, 1975; Chen et al., 2009). However, the size of \n\nhydrological impacts is not clearly related to the percentage impervious surface. The \n\nexistence of a threshold level of urbanization above which hydrological changes are \n\nnoticed is not consensual. Some studies have been reporting urbanization influences on \n\nstreamflow regime above 3-5% impervious surface (Yang et al., 2011), while others \n\nidentified a minimum of 20% (Brun and Band, 2000).  \n\nThe nature of hydrological changes varies greatly with the biophysical characteristics of \n\nthe catchment, such as geology, lithology, climate and soil properties, as well as \n\nanthropogenic activities, which affect land-use change history and the percentage and \n\ndistribution of impervious area (e.g. Boyd et al., 2003; Konrad and Booth, 2005; \n\nWMO/GWP, 2008). Each landscape contains different combinations and arrangements \n\n(distribution and size) of pervious and impervious surfaces (buildings, roads and other \n\npaved areas), which affect the amount of runoff produced and the speed at which it is \n\ndelivered to other parts of the catchment (Parikh et al., 2005; Jacobson, 2011).  \n\nSince 1960, many studies have focussed on urban hydrology, but few have studied peri-\n\nurban areas, particularly under Mediterranean climate. Although studies performed on \n\nperi-urban areas confirm many of the accepted theories regarding to urbanization impact \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n117 \n\non hydrological regime, they highlight the complexity involved in isolating land-use \n\nchange impacts in a real catchment with diverse land-uses and hydrological pathways \n\n(Perrin et al., 2001; Braud et al., 2013). The complexity of spatial pattern within peri-\n\nurban areas, the irregular rainfall regime of Mediterranean climate and the combination \n\nof artificial and natural flow pathways represent additional challenges to urban hydrology \n\n(Miller et al., 2014). Thus, it is important to understand the impact of different \n\nurbanization patterns on runoff and flow connectivity.  \n\nThis chapter aims to assess the impact of a Portuguese peri-urban area on catchment \n\nhydrology. The specific objectives are to: 1) assess the streamflow response of a \n\ncatchment undergoing urbanization process; 2) investigate the seasonal influence of the \n\nMediterranean climate on catchment discharge; 3) quantify the streamflow delivery from \n\ndifferent contributing areas, characterized by different land-use arrangements and their \n\ncontribution to catchment hydrology; 4) explore the role of different urbanization styles \n\non flow connectivity and stream discharge. Knowledge of the influence of different urban \n\nmosaics on peri-urban catchment hydrology is important to landscape managers and \n\nshould guide urban planning in order to restrict flow connectivity and reduce flood \n\nhazard. \n\n \n\n5.2. Study Area \n\nThe study focuses on Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, a small catchment (6 km2) located nearly 2 km \n\naway from the Coimbra city centre, one of the main cities in central Portugal (Figure 5.1). \n\nThe catchment is somewhat elongated in shape, draining S-N into the large floodplain of \n\nthe Mondego river. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \u2013 INFLUENCE OF THE URBANIZATION PATTERN ON STREAMFLOW OF A \n\nPERI-URBAN CATCHMENT UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE \n\n \n\n118 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1 - Location of Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment in Portugal and in relation to Coimbra \n\ncity centre (adapted from Google Earth, 2013). \n\n \n\nThe area has a Mediterranean sub-humid climate, with an annual average temperature of \n\n15\u00b0C, an average annual rainfall of 892 mm of rainfall and a strong contrast between dry \n\nsummer and winter conditions. The catchment experiences a progressive wet-up period \n\nfrom about October to December and thereafter maintains very moist conditions until late \n\nspring. It is a well-drained catchment (drainage density of 3.1 km km-2), supplied by a \n\ndendritic pattern with a perennial 3rd order stream (Strahler, 1957) and ephemeral \n\ntributaries (Figure 5.2a).  \n\n \n\na)                                                        b)  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2 - Catchment physical characteristics: a) digital elevation model and stream network, \n\nb) lithological units and faults. \n\n \n\nCoimbra \n\ncity centre\n\nN\n\n?\n\n1185 m\n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n119 \n\nFrom the geological point of view, the study site is located in the Orla Meso-Cenoz\u00f3ica \n\nOcidental, characterized by sandstone and limestone hills and broad shallow valleys with \n\nabundant alluvium. Orla is characterized by important aquifer systems, related to the \n\ndetrital and carbonate formations. The sequential organization of sedimentary rock loads \n\nto multi-layer aquifer systems, usually of karstic and porous nature. Generally, karstic \n\naquifers have limited auto-regulation capacity, evidenced by large variations in flow rate \n\nof the important springs between the rainy and dry seasons (Almeida et al., 1999). The \n\nRibeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment is characterized by contrasting geology, marked by areas \n\nof 1) sandstone, mostly represented by sand and gravel conglomerate and deposits from \n\nPaleogene/Neogene, with variable depth but not exceeding 25 m;  2) limestone formations \n\non the east side, represented by limestone and marl units from Cretaceous, with mean soil \n\ndepth of 7-8 m, and dolomitic and marl limestone of the Jurassic, which soil depth mostly \n\nranges between 0.1 m and 0.4 m; and 3) alluvial deposits of the Quaternary age, whose \n\ndepth may reach 5 m (Pato, 2007). The lithological units are interrupted by some \n\ngeological faults (Figure 4.2b). Soils are mainly represented by Cambisols (medium and \n\nfine-textured materials) and Podzols (derived from sandstone rock).  \n\nTopography of Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment ranges from 30 m to 205 m (Figure 5.2a). \n\nSlopes average is 11\u00ba, but steep slopes (from 17-31\u00ba) represent 10% of the area, and \n\nhillslope gradient reaches 36\u00ba in few locations.  \n\nThe catchment went through major land-use changes and an increasing urbanization \n\nprocess for the last half century as a result of the proximity to Coimbra city center. People \n\nliving in Coimbra municipality increased 150%, from 98027 in 1950 to 143396 in 2011, \n\nwhile in Antanhol, S\u00e3o Martinho and Santa Clara parishes, where Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es is \n\nlocated, population doubled, from 14315 to 26632 inhabitants (INE, 1950; INE, 2011). \n\nThe study catchment covers 16% of the mentioned parishes area, but based on aerial \n\nphotographs and urban cores location, it is estimated that people in the study site increased \n\nfrom 2500 to 7200 inhabitants. This led to the conversion of a rural area with few \n\ndispersed urban cores (before 1958) to a discontinuous urban fabric. In 1993, a new \n\nMaster Plan considered the study catchment as part of the Coimbra urban area, \n\nencouraged continuous urbanization and triggered a new urban consolidation phase \n\n(Tavares et al., 2012).  \n\nBetween 1958 and 2007, land-use changes in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es involved the conversion \n\nof agricultural fields (from 48% to 4%) to urban (from 8% to 32%) and forest areas (from \n\n44 to 64%) (Figure 5.3). After 2007, some deforestation occurred to build a major road, \n\nan enterprise park and to expand some existing urban cores. These changes led to urban \n\nareas covering 40% of the catchment in 2012. This urbanization trend is expected to \n\ncontinue, based on urban projects already approved.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \u2013 INFLUENCE OF THE URBANIZATION PATTERN ON STREAMFLOW OF A \n\nPERI-URBAN CATCHMENT UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE \n\n \n\n120 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3 - Variation of land-use cover between 1958 and 2012 (the largest open space in 1995 \n\nwas a result of forest fire). \n\n \n\nUrbanization has involved large areas of paved surfaces interrupting woodland and often \n\nsemi-abandoned agricultural terrain. Urban settings vary from older discontinuous \n\nbuildings and structures (<25 inhabitants km-2), comprising mostly detached houses \n\nsurrounded by gardens and delimited by walls, but also recent well-defined urban cores, \n\ncomprising apartment block (9900 inhabitants km-2) (Tavares et al., 2012). The area also \n\ncontains educational and health facilities, including a central hospital and some small \n\nindustrial facilities. Much of the urban area is located in the valleys but also in upslope \n\nsites, mostly along ridges including the catchment boundary (Figure 5.4). \n\nWithin the urban areas, separate drainage systems transport domestic waste water into a \n\ntreatment plant located outside the catchment, whereas the stormwater (including from \n\nroofs, streets and concrete paved area) generated in the most recent urban cores is piped \n\nto the main river and/or its tributaries. Where urban infrastructures and derelict urban land \n\nare surrounded by agriculture fields, however, stormwater just dissipates in these areas. \n\n \n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\n1958\n\n1973\n\n1979\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2002\n\n2007\n\n2012\n\nLand-use (%)\n\nUrban Agricultural\n\nWoodland and semi-natural Open spaces with little or no vegetation\n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n121 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4 - Spatial differences in land-use between the initial discontinuous urbanization process (1979) and the current continuous urbanization phase (2012) \n\nof Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es (adapted from Pato, 2007, Corine Land Cover, 2007, and Google Imagery, 2012). \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \u2013 INFLUENCE OF THE URBANIZATION PATTERN ON STREAMFLOW OF A \n\nPERI-URBAN CATCHMENT UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE \n\n \n\n122 \n\n5.3. Methodology \n\n5.3.1. Research design \n\nThe hydrological response of the Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment was assessed via a \n\nmonitoring network. In late 2005, a weir was constructed at the catchment outlet (ESAC) \n\nto measure stream discharge. This involves a 90\u00ba V-notch weir for the lower flows and a \n\nconcrete rectangular section for greater discharges. Water level in the pool behind the \n\nweir has been continuously recorded using a float-operated Thalimedes Shaft Encoder \n\n(OTT Hydromet) with integral data logger. However, several construction problems only \n\nallowed reliable water level data collection from October 2008 onwards.  \n\nDaily climatic data, including rainfall, temperature, wind and solar radiation were \n\nprovided by the Coimbra/Bencanta weather station, integrated in the national \n\nmeteorological network (12G/02UG, from IPMA), located 0.5 km north of the study area. \n\nAlthough spatial variation of rainfall was later found to be minor, three raingauges were \n\ninstalled across the study catchment in February 2008. These tipping-bucket raingauges \n\n(Rain-O-Matic from Pronamic, 0.2 mm resolution) were connected to a continuous \n\nrecording data logger (Onset HOBO).  \n\nIn October 2010, the hydrological network was extended by installing eight additional \n\nwater-level recorders (Odyssey, ~0.8 mm resolution), to provide sub-catchments \n\ndischarge data (Figure 5.5). Sites took into account land-use and lithology, local \n\nsuitability and accessibility. The purpose and characteristics of each sub-catchment were \n\nas follows: \n\n? Esp\u00edrito Santo measures the streamflow response of a highly urbanized sub-\ncatchment overlying sandstone; it was installed in an asymmetrical section, \n\ndelimited by a cement wall and an irregular compacted soil slope. \n \n\n? Quinta provides data for a large sandstone area, mostly dominated by forestry; it \nwas settled in a natural channel of rectangular shape. \n \n\n? Iparque was sited at the outlet of the detention basin constructed downstream of \nthe enterprise park area.  \n \n\n? Cov\u00f5es drains an area of sandstone and limestone, mostly dominated by forest but \nwith downslope urban cores; the monitored channel cross-section comprises a \n\nstraight cement wall on one side and an irregular herbaceous slope on the other. \n \n\n? Ribeiro da P\u00f3voa provides discharge data from most of the sandstone part of the \ncatchment; it was installed in a current concrete rectangular section; \n \n\n? Mina provides discharge data from an ephemeral watercourse overlying limestone \nthat also receives stormflow from a section of the recent constructed major road; \n\nit was installed in an existing concrete trapezoidal channel. \n \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n123 \n\n? Porto Bordalo measures the discharge of three ephemeral streams on limestone \n(including Mina sub-catchment); it was sited in a current concrete trapezoidal \n\nchannel. \n \n\n? Drabl provides discharge data from an extensive limestone area (including Porto \nBordalo and Mina sub-catchments), with a large urban cover downslope; it was \n\ninstalled in an existing stone trapezoidal channel. \n\n \n\n?  \n\nFigure 5.5 - Hydrological network installed in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment. \n\n \n\nVandalism (equipment damage and theft) restricted data acquisition, particularly at the \n\nIparque and Mina gauging stations. Destruction of raingauges led to the installation (in \n\ndifferent sites) of three additional double tipping-bucket raingauges (Davis Tipping-\n\nbucket Rain Collector, coupled to Odyssey rain gauge loggers, 0.2mm resolution) in \n\nJanuary 2011, and two more in June 2011.   \n\nEquipment maintenance was carried out at least every 3 months. Manual measurements \n\nof streamflow were made to calibrate and validate equipment results. In each gauging \n\nstation, water height was measured manually with a ruler, whereas flow velocity was \n\nmeasured with a float and a chronometer for low flows (<7 L s-1), or with an ultrasonic \n\ntransit time flow meter (V\u00f3rtice) for greater discharges, following Bedient and Huber \n\nmethod (1987). \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \u2013 INFLUENCE OF THE URBANIZATION PATTERN ON STREAMFLOW OF A \n\nPERI-URBAN CATCHMENT UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE \n\n \n\n124 \n\n5.3.2. Characterization of drainage area \n\nA detailed analysis of sub-catchments area was accomplished using cartographic \n\ninformation, aerial photographs and field visits. Characterization included drainage area, \n\nslope gradient, soil type, land-use and percentage impervious surface. Slope gradient was \n\nderived from a digital elevation model (DEM) with 5 m \u00d7 5 m pixel size, prepared using \n\ncontour and elevation points (supplied by Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Portugu\u00eas - IGP). The \n\nDEM was processed to fill null cells, to calculate flow directions and delimit drainage \n\nareas of all the gauging stations, based on Spatial Analyst Tools available on ArcGIS 10 \n\nsoftware. \n\nLand-use data from 2007 were available from Corine Land Cover (5 m \u00d7 5 m resolution), \n\nand cartographic information as regards to impermeable surfaces was provided by IGP. \n\nHowever, since these information was not available for recent years, it was manually \n\nupdated through the analysis of aerial photography using available Google Earth imagery \n\n(29/07/2009, 20/03/2011 and 13/06/2012) and field observations. Land-use and urban \n\nfeature polygons were drawn for 2009, 2011 and 2012, with Google Earth tools, and \n\nexported to ArcGIS 10. Detailed information on urban features encompassed: 1) \n\nimpermeable surfaces, including buildings, swimming pools, walls, roads, car parks, \n\ncourtyards, driveways and pavements; 2) semi-permeable surfaces, including paths, \n\ncompacted bare soil linked to parking and construction sites, as well as gardens covered \n\nby semi-permeable materials such as geotextiles; 3) permeable surfaces, mostly gardens; \n\nand 4) water detention basins, comprising structural flood measures but also sites where \n\nrunoff is retained due to walls and roads embankments. The percentages of impermeable, \n\nsemi-permeable and permeable surfaces in each catchment were calculated by dividing \n\nthe area of such features by the respective catchment area. Description of the storm \n\ndrainage system within the study site was not provided in time by the responsible \n\ninstitution, so it was based on observation during field visits. \n\n \n\n5.3.3. Data analysis \n\nCatchment hydrological response was analysed over five hydrological years (October 1 \n\nto September 30) (Palutikof et al., 1996), from 2008/09 to 2012/13. Analysis of discharge \n\nfrom the extended gauging station network was performed for three hydrological years \n\n2010/11 to 2012/13. \n\nUntil December 2010, rainfall data was provided by the Bencanta/Coimbra national \n\nmeteorological station (12G/02UG), because of vandalism with the installed raingauges. \n\nAfter January 2011, rainfall data was provided by the new raingauges installed. Spatial \n\ndifferences in rainfall records were investigated through Mann-Whitney U test (p<0.05), \n\nusing IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software. Since no significant difference was identified, \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n125 \n\nweighted average rainfall results were assumed uniform for the entire catchment. \n\nWeighted average rainfall was calculated from the gauges\u2019 area of influence, determined \n\nby Thiessen Polygons on ArcGIS 10 software. During periods of missing data, due to \n\nequipment malfunction/failure, weighted average was adjusted considering the available \n\nrainfall records. Data quality was checked by storage rainfall gauges installed adjacent to \n\nthe recording ones. Long-term rainfall records (INMG, 1971-2000) were used to calculate \n\nrainfall probability and recurrence periods of rainstorms. Potential evapotranspiration was \n\ncalculated based on Thornthwaite and Mather method (Thornthwaite and Mather, 1955), \n\nconsidering the climatic data from the Bencanta/Coimbra station. \n\nStage-discharge rating curves for each gauging station were derived from field \n\nmeasurements of water level and discharge. The quality of the rating curves was assessed \n\nthrough the calculation of the Perarson\u2019s rank correlation, Root Mean Square Error \n\n(RMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (E) between measured and \n\ncalculated flow. Streamflow records, calculated from the rating curves, were manually \n\nchecked, validated, corrected or removed, based on field measurements. Missing daily \n\nvalues were replaced by interpolation based on discharge relation between all stations for \n\nthe corresponding month. In order to compare data from drainage areas of different sizes \n\nand identify possible impact of land-use on the discharge, specific flows (L km-2 s-1) were \n\ncalculated by dividing all the data by the drainage area. These values also enabled runoff \n\ncoefficients to be calculated.  \n\nBaseflow and storm flow components were separated, through the application of a \n\nmathematical low-pass digital filter developed by Lyne and Hollick (1979), considering \n\nthe improvements suggested by Nathan and McMahon (1990). The constant used in the \n\nfilter was assumed to be 0.925, based on a visual inspection of several data sets which \n\nindicated that this value of the filter parameter was that yielded the most acceptable. The \n\nbaseflow index (BFI), defined as the ratio between baseflow and total streamflow (Nathan \n\nand McMahon, 1992), was calculated for all the gauging stations based on daily \n\nstreamflow data.  \n\nDifferences in flow magnitude of all the gauging stations were assessed through the \n\ncalculation of annual and monthly runoff coefficients (ratio between total discharge and \n\nrainfall), as well as individual storm event analysis. A storm event was defined by the \n\ntime interval between the beginning of the rainfall and the stop of storm flow. Rainfall \n\nevents that did not promote a rise in streamflow were not considered for the individual \n\nstorm event analysis. The study was performed for the January 2011 to September 2013 \n\nperiod, which had time resolution of rainfall data (5-minutes interval), comprising 310 \n\nstorm events. For individual storm events several rainfall and hydrograph parameters \n\nwere calculated. The rainfall characteristics considered were the depth, duration and \n\nintensity - mean hourly intensity and maximum intensities observed in 5 and 15 minutes \n\n(these maximum values were converted into mm h-1) and 1-hour. The hydrograph \n\nparameters considered were: 1) storm runoff, 2) peak flow discharge, 3) response time, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \u2013 INFLUENCE OF THE URBANIZATION PATTERN ON STREAMFLOW OF A \n\nPERI-URBAN CATCHMENT UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE \n\n \n\n126 \n\ndefined as the time lag between the centroid of the rainfall and peak flow (Lana-Renault \n\net al., 2011), 4) recession time, which corresponds to the time interval between peak flow \n\nand the time when storm flow cease, and 5) runoff coefficient, defined as the ratio \n\nbetween stream runoff and rainfall. Differences in response and recession times between \n\ndifferent gauging stations were investigated with Kruskal-Wallis test, at 0.05 significance \n\nlevel. Antecedent Dry Period (sum of rainfall over a defined period of days) was \n\ncalculated for 7, 14 and 30 days prior to a storm event (API7, API14 and API30). The \n\nrelation between rainfall and hydrograph parameters were analysed through Spearman\u2019s \n\nrank correlation coefficient (r), in IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software. The relation between \n\nannual runoff coefficient and the characteristics of the drainage area (area, mean slope, \n\nurban area extent and impermeable surfaces percentage) were also assessed. For the \n\n2010/11 hydrological year, urban area and percentage impermeable surfaces were derived \n\nfrom the March 2011 aerial photograph, whereas for the 2012/13 and 2013/14 \n\nhydrological years it was based on June 2012 aerial photograph. Between these years, no \n\nland-use change was observed. \n\n \n\n5.4. Results and analysis \n\n5.4.1.

Major land-use change was recorded in Iparque sub-catchment (in upslope \n\nsandstone area), where 97% of the forest area was clear-felled for the enterprise park \n\nconstruction. Nevertheless, the majority of this area is still in an initial build-up stage, \n\nlargely covered by compacted bare soil, considered as semipermeable area (Figure 5.7). \n\nThese changes led to an enlargement of the urban area from 6% to 25% in Quinta drainage \n\narea, although most of it is still compacted bare soil (semipermeable) (Figure 5.7).

Within \n\nRibeiro da P\u00f3voa (56% of the catchment area), in 2007, impermeable surfaces \n\nrepresented 43% of its urban drainage area, whereas in 2012 they covered 37% of the \n\narea. Most of these impermeable surfaces were located downslope, between Ribeiro da \n\nP\u00f3voa and the upstream gauging stations (38-27%, between 2007 and 2012) and in \n\nEsp\u00edrito Santo (56-49%) urban drainage area. Inside Drabl drainage area (25% of the \n\ncatchment), 44-41% of the impermeable surfaces were concentrated in the small \n\ndownslope area, between these and Porto Bordalo gauging stations (39 ha, 26% of the \n\nDrabl area). This high urban intensity contrasts with the upslope Porto Bordalo drainage \n\narea, where the impervious surfaces were dispersed across the valley bottom and in the \n\nupslope W side (Figure 5.8). Nevertheless, the most recent urban cores constructed in \n\nPorto Bordalo and Drabl drainage areas (limestone) are characterized by townhouses and \n\nflats (Figure 5.9a and 5.9b), whereas in upslope sandstone areas, the urban areas include \n\nlarger permeable areas, such as gardens (Figure 5.9c and 5.9d). The different urbanization \n\nstyles reflect differences in the extent of permeable and semipermeable surfaces within \n\nthe drainage areas. \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n129 \n\na) b) \n\n  \nc) d) \n\n  \n\nFigure 5.9 - Different types of urban areas across Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment: a) recent urban \n\ncores with greater population density in NE side, b) townhouses characterized by intensive soil \n\nsealing in E, and older urban cores with c) lower population density and d) isolated houses. \n\n \n\nAcross the catchment, management of storm runoff differs with age and location of the \n\nurban core. In the smaller and dispersed urban nuclei located in upslope areas, storm \n\nrunoff was routed downslope (enhanced by the slope gradient and/or driven by the storm \n\ndrainage system) to forest and/or agricultural soils, at different distances to the stream \n\nnetwork. Increasing distance to the stream provides more infiltration/retention \n\nopportunities, leading to generally low runoff coefficients and greater response time to \n\nrainfall events. On the other hand, urban areas located downslope are characterized by a \n\ngreater intensity of impervious surfaces, with road runoff collected in gutters and quickly \n\ndelivered into downslope watercourses or nearby soils. The stream network represents a \n\nmix of semi-natural (with soil banks but partially straightened) and channelized sections. \n\nOpen artificial channels contribute the stream for a few metres before Porto Bordalo \n\ngauging station and for a larger distance immediately after Ribeiro da P\u00f3voa station. The \n\nstream section between Porto Bordalo and Drabl stations is piped, flowing beneath the \n\nsoil surface. Along the main stream and larger tributaries crossing urban areas, some \n\nhydraulic infrastructures were built in order to by-pass the storm runoff from roads, for \n\nexample. At the outlet of the enterprise park, under construction area in upslope \n\ncatchment, a detention basin has been created to minimize downstream flood peaks. This \n\nstructure consists of a 3650 m2 basin with three small pipes (\u00d8= 0.20 m) that allows a \n\nperennial water flow downstream, but with a peak flow delay during storm events. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \u2013 INFLUENCE OF THE URBANIZATION PATTERN ON STREAMFLOW OF A \n\nPERI-URBAN CATCHMENT UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE \n\n \n\n130 \n\n5.4.2. Climate during the monitoring period 2008-13 \n\nClimate during the years 2008/09 to 2012/13 showed the typical Mediterranean pattern, \n\nwith hot and dry summers, as well as cool and wet winters (Figure 5.10). During the study \n\nperiod, rainfall between June and August represented 2-11% of the annual rainfall, similar \n\nto the average of 8% (INMG, 1971-2000). There were great differences, however, \n\nbetween the very dry 2011/12 (551mm, recurrence period of 17 years) and very wet \n\n2012/13 (947 mm, 3 years return period) (Figure 5.11). These annual differences were \n\nalso reflected in potential evapotranspiration differences (greater in 2011/12 and lower in \n\n2012/13), typical of the Mediterranean environments (Figure 5.12). Rainy days varied \n\nfrom 89 days in 2008/09 to 200 days in 2012/13 (Table 5.2). Low rainfall intensities of \n\n<2 mm day-1 were dominant. Maximum daily rainfall ranged from 27 mm in 2008/09 and \n\n2011/12 to 74 mm in 2009/10. These maximum daily intensities were not associated with \n\nthe greatest hourly intensities, which varied between 10 mm in 2012/13 and 58 mm in \n\n2009/10, respectively.

Within Drabl, 48% of its flow was delivered by Porto Bordalo, \n\nwhich covers 74% of its drainage area. Porto Bordalo provided 20% of Drabl\u2019 baseflow \n\nand 49% of its stormflow. This results highlight the prominence of the remaining 26% of \n\nthe Drabl\u2019 downslope drainage area (below Porto Bordalo) on flow supply, particularly \n\nstormflow. \n\nIn sub-catchments overlying limestone, stormflow encompassed the majority of the flow, \n\nwith median values ranging from 62% to 86% during wet periods (increasing from \n\nCov\u00f5es, to Drabl and then to Porto Bordalo). In summer, stormflow was even greater in \n\nDrabl and Porto Bordalo flows (86% and 100%), but it was lower in Cov\u00f5es (50%), \n\npartially overlying sandstone (36% of the drainage area). Over sandstone lithology, \n\nstormflow encompassed a considerably lower fractions of the total discharge, with \n\nmedian values ranging between 27% to 45% during the wet seasons, but from 16% and \n\n31% in the dry seasons (increasing from Ribeiro da P\u00f3voa to ESAC, Quinta and Esp\u00edrito \n\nSanto).  \n\n \n\n5.4.3.2.3. Spatio-temporal response during storm events \n\nStorm event analysis indicated that only a small threshold amount of rainfall was required \n\nto generate runoff all over the catchment. During wet season, only 0.3 mm of rainfall was \n\nnecessay after several antecedent storm events (API7 >25 mm), whereas under summer \n\nconditions 0.7 mm was necessary with less antecedent rainfall (API7 >7 mm or API14 \n\n>13mm). The seasonal climate pattern greatly influenced the runoff and storm runoff \n\ncoefficients associated with individual storm events. Storm runoff coefficients were \n\nhigher during the wet (median values ranged from 2% in Cov\u00f5es to 15% in Esp\u00edrito Santo) \n\nthan dry seasons (from 0.3% in Quinta to 7% in Esp\u00edrito Santo), particularly in Porto \n\nBordalo and Quinta gauging stations (6% vs 0.4% and 6% vs 0.3%, respectively) (Figure \n\n5.23a). However, largest summer storms were only 14 mm of rainfall, whereas in wet \n\nperiods it attained 29 mm. Runoff coefficients increased with: 1) storm rainfall (r ranged \n\nbetween 0.121 and 0.362 for the different gauging stations, p<0.05); 2) maximum 15-\n\nminute rainfall intensity (r ranged between 0.150 and 0.301 for different gauging stations, \n\np<0.05), except in Porto Bordalo and Drabl, which always exhibited greater stormflow \n\nthroughout the year; and 3) antecedent rainfall (correlation with API7 ranged between \n\n0.228 and 0.563 for the different gauging stations, p<0.01, but correlations with API14 \n\nand API30 were also found for the same level of significance). \n\nAt the end of winter (late March 2013), immediately after the largest rainfall period (API7 \n\n>50 mm and API30 >160 mm) the greatest storm runoff coefficient reached 70% of the \n\nrainfall in the fully limestone areas (Porto Bordalo and Drabl), 52% in Cov\u00f5es, partially \n\ncovered by limestone (62%), 39% at the catchment outlet (ESAC, 41% overlying \n\nlimestone), 37% of the largely urbanized sandstone area (Esp\u00edrito Santo) and, 14% and \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n143 \n\n10% in Quinta and Ribeiro da P\u00f3voa, covered by more than 60% of forest under \n\nsandstone (Figure 5.22b).  \n\nDuring the summer, the highest storm runoff coefficients were attained in the largest \n\nurbanized catchments, but did not surpass 18% in Esp\u00edrito Santo and 11% in Drabl, as a \n\nresult of the greatest rainfall intensities (6-10 mm h-1, in 5-minutes interval). In this \n\nsummer storm, storm runoff coefficient only reached 8% in Porto Bordalo, overlaying \n\nlimestone, 6% in Quinta and Cov\u00f5es, with the largest forest cover, and 3% in ESAC and \n\nRibeiro da P\u00f3voa, the largest drainage areas, mainly overlying sandstone. Nevertheless, \n\nmedian storm runoff coefficients over three years of study did not show a significant \n\ncorrelation with drainage area, mean slope, land-use or percentage impervious area \n\n(Figure 5.22b).  \n\n \n\n         a) \n\n \n\n        b) \n\n \n\nFigure 5.22 - Box plot showing the (a) runoff coefficient and the (b) storm runoff coefficient \n\ndifferences between individual storm events observed under dry and wet periods, for all the \n\nmonitored gauging stations.  \n\n \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nWet Dry Wet Dry Wet Dry Wet Dry Wet Dry Wet Dry Wet Dry\n\nESAC Drabl P.

Despite the smaller drainage area of Drabl, \n\nmedian peak flow was 50% higher than in Ribeiro da P\u00f3voa. Even the smallest drainage \n\narea under limestone (Porto Bordalo) displayed marginally higher peak flows than the \n\nlargest sandstone Ribeiro da P\u00f3voa (37 L s-1 vs 26 L s-1), despite the slightly great urban \n\ncover in the later (Figure 5.6). Drabl and Ribeiro da P\u00f3voa provided 89% of the median \n\npeak flows of ESAC, but this contribution falls to 50% during the highest storm event. \n\nThese results stresses the importance of downslope catchment area, embracing 12% of \n\nthe catchment urban area, to increase the magnitude of the largest floods. Within \n\nlimestone areas, Porto Bordalo, covering 74% of Drabl drainage area, supplied 66% of \n\nmedian peak flows in Drabl. However, contrary to the observations in ESAC, during \n\ngreatest storm events, the runoff contribution from Porto Bordalo increased to 74% of \n\nthe Drabl peak flow, perhaps denoting a greater overland flow connectivity in the upslope \n\ndrainage areas during largest storms. Within Ribeiro da P\u00f3voa, the greater peak flows \n\nwere observed in Quinta, which represents the largest area. However, Esp\u00edrito Santo with \n\nslightly lower area than Cov\u00f5es but greater urban cover, showed somewhat higher peak \n\nflows (Figure 5.23). Nevertheless, considering the normalized discharge (divided by the \n\ndrainage area), Quinta and Cov\u00f5es showed similar median peak flows (0.2 L km-2 s-1), \n\nbut Esp\u00edrito Santo attained higher values (0.3 L km-2 s-1). Nonetheless, during the largest \n\nstorms, the discharges from Quinta, and particularly Cov\u00f5es, increased deeper than in \n\nEsp\u00edrito Santo (peak flow of 2.3 L km-2 s-1, 2.9 L km-2 s-1 and 3.5 L km-2 s-1, respectively).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.23- Spatial variability of peak flows measured during individual storms within \n\nRibeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment. \n\n \n\nResults demonstrate the increase of overland flow connectivity during largest storms \n\nwithin all the drainage areas, but particularly within Cov\u00f5es and Quinta.

Cov\u00f5es, with a smaller area mostly on \n\nlimestone, recorded the fastest response time, with a median value of 5 minutes. This \n\ndrainage area, however, included downslope impermeable surfaces (Figure 5.5). In \n\nEsp\u00edrito Santo, with more than twice the urban cover of Cov\u00f5es, peak flows were reached \n\nin a median time of 15 minutes. In fact, Esp\u00edrito Santo and Drabl showed similar response \n\ntimes (p>0.05), may be because, despite the lithology, they have similar land-uses (Figure \n\n4.7).

Quinta \n\nexperienced greater response times than at all the other gauging stations (p<0.05), with a \n\nmedian value of 50 minutes. This is because the recent enterprise park drains into a \n\nconstructed detention basin, about 800 m upstream of Quinta gauging station. Field \n\nobservations, however, revealed that during larger storms the flow exceeds the drainage \n\ncapacity of the stream, thus some streamflow run-off into woodland land.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.26 - Differences in response time during storm events for the catchment (ESAC) and \n\nsub-catchments. \n\n \n\nRecession time ranged, in median, from 3h in Porto Bordalo (p<0.05), with the smallest \n\ndrainage area fully overlying limestone, to 7h for the overall catchment (ESAC) (p<0.05) \n\n(Figure 5.27).

Discussion \n\n5.5.1. Hydrological response of catchment to weather and climate  \n\nRainfall seems to be the main driver of Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es streamflow. Nevertheless, \n\nprevious studies performed under Mediterranean conditions also reported the importance \n\nof temperature on runoff, due to its influence on potential evapotranspiration (Lacey and \n\nGrayson, 1998; Rose and Peters, 2001; Lana-Renault et al., 2011). Rainfall and \n\ntemperature also influence baseflow (e.g. Lacey and Grayson, 1998), which represents an \n\nimportant component of the catchment annual discharge (37-39%). Rainfall has positive \n\nand negative effects on baseflow in different seasons, as a result of baseflow recharge \n\nfactors which affect groundwater discharge to streams. Over the year, BFI increases \n\nduring wetting (autumn) and wettest (winter) months, but reached highest values during \n\nthe summer (37% and 63% in wet and dry seasons), as a consequence of the antecedent \n\nrecharge. Only in September was there a substantial decrease of BFI (Figure 5.15b), due \n\nto lower rainfall and higher water losses promoted by greater evapotranspiration \n\n(resulting from higher summer temperatures), which leads to a drop in groundwater level. \n\nThe impact of climatic factors on the water table fall was greatest during the driest \n\nhydrological year (2011/12), when BFI attained the lowest annual value (36%) (Figure \n\n5.14b). Decreased groundwater level as a result of driest conditions may be also linked \n\nwith enhanced groundwater pumping, for irrigation uses. Based on field observations, 32 \n\nwells for irrigation purposes were identified in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, mainly located in the \n\nagricultural SE and SW parts of the catchment (overlying sandstone) and in the valley \n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\nESAC Drabl P.

In Makaha valley, Hawai, between 1971 and 1991, groundwater pumping was \n\nestimated to reduce streamflow by 19-22%. Subsequent additional pumping linked to the \n\nuse of a new irrigation well leaded to a 36% reduction on streamflow (Mair and Fares, \n\n2010).   \n\nQuinta drainage area, located in upslope sandstone, showed an almost continuous flow \n\nover the year, provided by several active springs, which supplied 16% of the catchment \n\nbaseflow (Figure 5.21b). Only during the driest summer of 2011/12 were there a few days \n\nwithout flow, as well as in the subsequent hydrological year (Figure 5.18).  \n\nGenerally, the low BFI of Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es (36%-39%) is typical of catchments with \n\nlow storage capacity (Braund et al., 2013), i.e. high evapotranspiration loss (Figure 5.12), \n\nbut also linked to deep water infiltration. The great infiltration results from the generally \n\ndeep soil and the easy infiltration of rainfall provided by abundant carbonates and \n\nsandstones. In addition, the deep filled valley on which the catchment is located may lead \n\nto subsurface flow under the gauge, which contributes for the low annual runoff \n\ncoefficients (14-22%) measured. \n\nThe seasonal variability of rainfall has a noticeable impact on streamflow discharge, \n\nwhich increases during the rainy seasons and is restricted in summer. Dry soils in summer \n\nlead to a small streamflow response, low storm runoff coefficients (Figure 5.17), as \n\ntypically observed under Mediterranean conditions (Lana-Renault et al., 2011). Lower \n\nstorm runoff coefficients in September/October (beginning of the rainy season) have been \n\nattributed to the rainfall being used to recharge catchment soil moisture (Garc\u00eda-Ruiz et \n\nal., 2008; Lana-Renault et al., 2011). As a consequence, during dry conditions, \n\ninfiltration-excess overland flow is the only active runoff process, occurring in response \n\nto short and intense rainstorms, mostly over degraded areas (compacted soils with limited \n\nvegetation cover) and on hydrophobic soils.  \n\nIn Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, hydrophobicity was identified within woodland areas and \n\nabandoned agricultural fields (Chapter 3). The impact of hydrophobicity on soil matrix \n\ninfiltration capacity and enhanced overland flow have been reported at the hillslope scale \n\n(e.g. Ferreira, 1996) and at catchment level (Ferreira et al. 2000), particularly in Ribeira \n\ndos Cov\u00f5es, as discussed on Chapter 3. However, results from stream gauging stations \n\nshow a limited impact of infiltration-excess from hydrophobic soils at the sub-catchment \n\nscale. During summer months, infiltration-excess overland flow promoted by \n\nhydrophobic soils lead to a slight increase in the storm runoff coefficients measured in \n\nRibeiro da P\u00f3voa and Cov\u00f5es (Figure 5.20), with the largest woodland areas, mainly \n\ncovered by pine and eucalypt, linked to greatest soil hydrophobic conditions (e.g. Doerr \n\net al., 2000). Nevertheless, the low impact at the sub-catchment scale, may be a result of \n\nthe bypass of run-on water through preferential flow paths to deep soil layers, typical of \n\nvegetated hydrophobic soils (Dekker and Ritsema, 1994; Doerr et al., 2000), but also due \n\nto enhanced evapotranspiration and great surface water interception and retention of the \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n151 \n\nlimited rainfall amount typical of summer storms, which may be not enough to fill the \n\nsurface depressions and run-off freely (Darboux et al., 2001). Grayson et al. (1997) also \n\nfound that vertical flow is the controlling factor for the dry state of the soil. However, \n\nduring dry periods, in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, streamflow abstraction for private reservoirs \n\nand field irrigation was observed in sandstone areas. This may reduce the already limited \n\nstreamflow which reaches the gauging stations, masking the hydrophobicity impact on \n\ncatchment discharge. This was seen, for example, within Quinta drainage area, where a \n\nlandowner diverts the streamflow into a tank with a capacity of approximately 100 m3, \n\nplaced 500 m upslope the gauging station.   \n\nOverland flow also occurred in wet periods during larger rainfall events, demonstrated by \n\nthe significant positive correlation between runoff and rainfall intensity during storm \n\nevents. The influence of this runoff process was clearly noticed in 16th November 2009, \n\nduring the largest rainfall event of the study period (Figure 5.14a). However, during the \n\nwetting-up and drying-down transition periods, the hydrological response was variable, \n\nwith infiltration-excess and saturation runoff processes occurring at the same time in \n\ndifferent parts of the catchment, depending on the depth of the water table (which could \n\nbe a pershed water table on slopes) before the event and the storm characteristics (depth \n\nand intensity).  \n\nSaturation overland flow was more prone in late winter and beginning of spring, as a \n\nresult of greater soil moisture content, favoured by water table rise. Soil saturation was \n\nobserved in some valley bottoms, particularly under sandstone and catchment \n\ndownstream. This led to greater storm runoff coefficients from individual late \n\nwinter/spring storms 2-19 times higher than in summer (Figure 5.22). Soil saturation was \n\nalso observed in shallow soils (<0.4 m) of the limestone hillslopes (Ferreira et al., 2014), \n\naccompanied by subsurface lateral flow (Figure 5.28a). Subsurface saturation restricts \n\ndeeper percolation and enhances the flow above that layer (Dahlke et al., 2012). \n\nMacropore flow can be a major process controlling the hydrologic response of a \n\ncatchment to storm events (Peters and Ratcliffe, 1998). Nevertheless, subsurface lateral \n\nflow was also observed within sandstone areas, particularly in upslope areas (Figure \n\n5.28b). Subsurface flow has been reported to be an important component of the catchment \n\nhydrology (McDaniel et al., 2008; Buda et al., 2009). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \u2013 INFLUENCE OF THE URBANIZATION PATTERN ON STREAMFLOW OF A \n\nPERI-URBAN CATCHMENT UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE \n\n \n\n152 \n\na) b) \n\n  \n\n  Figure 5.28- Subsurface lateral flow observed in a) limestone shallow soils and b) upslope \n\nsandstone. \n\n \n\nIn Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, analysis of individual storm events also showed increased storm \n\nrunoff coefficients with greater antecedent soil moisture, as a consequence of enhanced \n\nflow connectivity over the hillslope and between the hillslope and the stream network. \n\nThis is indicated by the significant positive correlations between storm runoff coefficient \n\nand the antecedent precipitation index. In addition, storm size has an effect on the \n\noccurrence of water ponding as well as on flow connectivity. With smaller storms, patches \n\nof saturation (or near-saturation) were smaller and the degree of connectivity was \n\nmarkedly lower, resulting in smaller trench responses. The location and extension of \n\nsaturated areas varies through time, with antecedent soil moisture. These variable source \n\nareas have been identified in previous studies in other climatic settings (Troendle, 1985; \n\nEaston et al., 2008; Dahlke et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2014).  \n\nFlow connectivity is not confined to overland flow but may be also established at the \n\nsubsurface, depending on soil moisture distribution. This pattern is influenced by \n\ntopography, which controls the dynamics of isolated patches of saturation, defining the \n\nhillslope hydrological system and the catchment response (Famiglietti et al., 1998; Zehe \n\net al., 2005). Meerveld and McDonnell (2006) demonstrated that the connectivity \n\nbetween subsurface saturation patches was a necessary prerequisite for exceeding the \n\nrainfall threshold needed to drive sub-surface lateral flow in a Mountain catchment of \n\nGeorgia, USA. A study performed by Hopp and McDonnell (2009) in a hillslope of \n\nGeorgia, showed that significant lateral subsurface stormflow (>1 mm) only occurred \n\nwhen more or less well connected hillslope-scale areas of saturation or near saturation \n\n(within 95% relative saturation) developed at the soil\u2013lithology interface, if the input \n\nexceed the topography-related threshold to induce spilling that leads to connection. \n\nRecent studies have shown that during autumn wetting (Harpold et al., 2010) and wet \n\n(winter) periods (McDaniel et al., 2008) near-stream areas connect with hillside saturated \n\nareas if the transient water table in the hillslope establishes whole-slope hydraulic \n\nconnectivity. Reduced hillslope connectivity restricts the generation of saturation \n\noverland flow to small portions of the study area during the heavy rainy season (Haga et \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n153 \n\nal., 2005). Srinivasan and McDowell (2009) found that disproportionately large runoff \n\namounts are contributed by less than 10% of the catchment area.  \n\nAlthough no significant seasonal difference being observed in the response time of storm \n\nevents analysed in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment, rapid streamflow response was \n\nobserved during near-saturation conditions in previous studies performed under \n\nMediterranean climate, due to greater flow connectivity (Hopp and McDonell, 2009; \n\nNasta et al., 2013). \n\n \n\n5.5.2. Lithological influence on the streamflow regime \n\nLithology plays an important role on Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es discharge, mainly due to \n\nbaseflow regulation. Median annual BFI did not surpass 5% on limestone areas (Porto \n\nBordalo, Drabl and Cov\u00f5es), whereas in sandstone it ranged between 25-33% in upstream \n\ntributaries (Esp\u00edrito Santo and Quinta, respectively) and 37-38% in downstream areas \n\n(Figure 5.19a). These differences indicated the perennial regime of most of the sandstone \n\nareas, which contrasts with the ephemeral regime of the streams draining the limestone \n\nareas.  \n\nIn the study site, seasonal variability on BFI was also affected by the lithology. On \n\nlimestone BFI was twice as high in the dry than wet season, whereas in sandstone it was \n\ntwice as high under wet conditions. These seasonal changes promoted by the lithology \n\ndid not correlate with differences in the number of days without flow. Downstream \n\ngauging stations showed a continuous (at the outlet) or almost uninterrupted flow over \n\nthe year, despite the great difference in the baseflow levels between sandstone and \n\nlimestone areas (mean annual baseflow of 47 mm in Ribeiro da P\u00f3voa and 5 mm in \n\nDrabl). In upstream areas, limestone gauging stations (Porto Bordalo and Cov\u00f5es) \n\nshowed nearly twice as many days without flow than the sandstone stations (Esp\u00edrito \n\nSanto and Quinta). However, larger number of active springs within Quinta drainage area \n\nprovided more days with flow than Esp\u00edrito Santo (Figure 5.18). Only in later summer \n\ndid the flow from springs cease. Spring locations may be favoured by the presence of \n\ngeological faults (Figure 5.2a).  \n\nDifferences in baseflow were driven by the water table position within the distinct \n\nlithological units. Water table was closer to the surface in topographic lows, and seems \n\nto follow the hillslope relief under sandstone areas, whereas in limestone it seems to be \n\ndeeper. Under limestone, typical rock fragmentation may provide deep water infiltration \n\nand horizontal movement (Almeida et al., 1999), as observed in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es \n\n(Figure 5.28). The multilayer aquifer systems associated with the limestone hillslopes, \n\nmay provide water storage capacity through the rainy season. However, the limited water \n\nstorage in superficial deposits and the thin soils of limestone areas, lead to rainfall \n\nconversion into storm runoff which enters directly to the stream via overland flow, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \u2013 INFLUENCE OF THE URBANIZATION PATTERN ON STREAMFLOW OF A \n\nPERI-URBAN CATCHMENT UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE \n\n \n\n154 \n\nexhibiting a lower baseflow component in the stream discharge. This could be also \n\nfavoured by the lower woodland cover under limestone areas, leading to lower \n\nevapotranspiration losses than in sandstone areas.  \n\nGreater silt and clay soil contents in limestone leads to lower permeability than sandstone \n\nsoils (Ferreira et al., 2012c), enhancing storm flow which reaches the stream network. \n\nThis may partially explain the higher storm runoff coefficients and greater peak flows \n\nmeasured in limestone areas during individual rainfall events. Median storm runoff \n\ncoefficients reached 2.6% and 3.4% for Drabl and Porto Bordalo, whereas in sandstone \n\ndominated areas they were&lt;1.5% (Figure 5.22). Drabl also reached median peak flows \n\ntwice as high as at Ribeiro da P\u00f3voa, despite draining half size of the area (Figure 5.23). \n\nIn addition, peak flows in Drabl (reached after 10 minutes) were quickly transferred \n\ndownstream and contributed to the ESAC peak flow (Figure 5.26).  \n\nDespite the above stated differences between baseflow among limestone and sandstone \n\nareas, the impact of lithology on the recession time was not noticeable (Figure 5.27). This \n\nmay be a result of the influence of different land-use and several topographic \n\ncharacteristics, such as relief, elevation, length of stream network and drainage density \n\n(Zecharias and Brutsaert, 1988; Nathan and McMahon, 1992; Lacey and Grayson, 1998). \n\nThe similar recession time between Drabl and Cov\u00f5es may be due to similar lithology, \n\naltimetry and mean slope (Table 5.1). Drabl and Esp\u00edrito Santo have similar land-uses \n\n(Figure 5.6), Drabl and Quinta, as well as Esp\u00edrito Santo and Cov\u00f5es drains areas with \n\nsimilar size, Esp\u00edrito Santo and Quinta are both located in upstream sandstone, with \n\nsimilar altimetry, and Quinta and Cov\u00f5es, drain the largest woodland areas. This suggests \n\nthe dominance of overland flow on storm runoff. \n\n \n\n5.5.3. Impact of land-use and urbanization pattern on streamflow \n\nDuring the study period, land-use, and particularly urban areas, did not seem to be a \n\nsignificant factor controlling the streamflow response, possibly due to climate variability. \n\nAlthough previous studies have identified the land-use as a critical variable in the \n\nexamination of stream discharge (e.g. Tang et al., 2005; Galster et al., 2006; Loperfido  \n\net al., 2014), other researchers reported the dominance of the weather settings and the \n\ncatchment characteristics on the hydrological response within urbanizing catchments \n\n(Rose and Peters, 2001; Braud et al., 2013). Some methods have been devised to separate \n\nthe influence of climate and land-use on the hydrology (Semadeni-Davies et al., 2008; \n\nFranczyk and Chang, 2009), but these methods require long data records and are not \n\nappropriate if the land-use changes were already happening during the hydrological \n\nmeasurements response, as in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es.  \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n155 \n\nAlthough the limited discharge records preclude consideration of long-term hydrological \n\ntrends, some comments may be inferred as regards to the land-use change in Ribeira dos \n\nCov\u00f5es, and specifically to urbanization impact on storm hydrographs and baseflow \n\ncomponent. At the catchment scale, there was not a clear change tendency on annual \n\nrunoff coefficients through the study period, linked to the urbanization pattern, but runoff \n\ncoefficient was greater in late 2012/13 (22% of the rainfall). Nevertheless, the slightly \n\nhigher rainfall between 2012/13 than 2009/10 (Figure 5.11), reflected in a 5% increase \n\non annual runoff coefficients (Figure 5.14) may be indicative of the urbanization \n\ninfluence (6% increase in the urban area and 5% increase of the impermeable surfaces), \n\nparticularly noticing the minor decrease on annual BFI. Urbanization has been widely \n\nreported to enhance runoff and reduce baseflow components of the stream discharge \n\n(Shuster et al., 2005; Zhang and Shuster, 2014). However, in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es the \n\ndecreasing BFI was more a result of the lower recharge in the antecedent dry year than a \n\nconsequence of the urbanization, particularly considering the larger aquifer beneath the \n\nstudy site.    \n\nDuring the study period, greatest peak discharge across the catchment was also observed \n\nin 2012/13 (Figure 5.16), demonstrating a twice higher magnitude than in previous years, \n\ngreatest than rainfall peak increase. However, the comparison of storm events observed \n\nbetween January 2011 and September 2013 did not show increasing peak flows and storm \n\nrunoff coefficients over time (Figure 5.29). Nevertheless, the relationship between the \n\nurban increase and these streamflow variables may not be noticed for storm events with \n\nsmall return period, as the ones observed during the study period (<2 years). Hollis (1975) \n\nreported that paving over 5% of the landscape did not affect flood peaks with a return \n\nperiod of one-year. However, increasing runoff and peak discharges with urbanization \n\nhave been reported in studies performed in USA (e.g. Cook and Dickinson, 1985; Rose \n\nand Peters, 2001). \n\n \n\n  a)                                                                 b)  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.29 \u2013 Relationship between rainfall amount and a) peak flow, and b) storm runoff \n\ncoefficient, of storm events observed between 2010/11 and 2012/13, at the catchment outlet.  \n\n \n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nP\ne\na\nk\n\n f\nlo\n\nw\n (\n\nL\n s\n\n-1\n)\n\nRainfall (mm)\n\n2010/11 2011/12\n2012/13 Linear (2010/11)\nLinear (2011/12) Linear (2012/13)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30S\nto\n\nrm\n r\n\nu\nn\n\no\nff\n\n c\no\n\ne\nff\n\nic\nie\n\nn\nt \n\n(%\n)\n\nRainfall (mm)\n\n2010/11 2011/12\n2012/13 Linear (2010/11)\nLinear (2011/12) Linear (2012/13)\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \u2013 INFLUENCE OF THE URBANIZATION PATTERN ON STREAMFLOW OF A \n\nPERI-URBAN CATCHMENT UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE \n\n \n\n156 \n\nSince increasing urban area in the last few years did not seem to affect the peak flows in \n\nRibeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment, the greatest peak observed in 2012/13 may be a result of \n\ngreater flow connectivity enhanced by greater soil moisture, as discussed in section \n\n5.4.3.2., associated with the higher rainfall of that year. Larger time series and a multiple \n\nregression approach may be useful to explore this in future work. \n\nBased in all gauging stations results, if the hydrological impact of different lithological \n\nunits (discussed in 5.5.2 section) are considered, runoff coefficient increased with urban \n\nand impermeable surfaces cover (Figure 5.30). Quinta and Cov\u00f5es with the largest \n\nwoodland areas (>80%) of the sandstone and limestone sides, respectively, showed the \n\nlowest runoff coefficients (14% and 7% over the study period), apart from Porto Bordalo. \n\nLower runoff in woodland areas may result from higher transpiration losses and greater \n\nwater interception and retention (e.g. Mahmood et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2013). Surface \n\nroughness, characteristic of woodland land-uses, increases soil irregularities and cavities \n\nand therefore depression storage capacity, creating opportunities for water infiltration, \n\ndelaying or eliminating overland flow transfer to downstream (Appels et al., 2011; \n\nRodr\u00edguez-Caballero et al., 2012). Vegetation can create a mixture of run-off and run-on \n\nsites, determined by soil wetness in semiarid environments, of utmost importance to \n\ninterrupt hydrological connectivity (Appels et al., 2011; Castillo et al., 2003).  \n\n \n\n                              a) \n\n \n                              b) \n\n \n\nFigure 5.30 - Linear relations between storm runoff coefficients over three years and the mean \n\n(a) urban area and (b) impermeable surfaces cover, within Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es drainage areas. \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n\nS\nto\n\nrm\n r\n\nu\nn\n\no\nff\n\n c\no\n\ne\nff\n\nic\nie\n\nn\nt \n\n(%\n)\n\nUrban cover (%)\n\nCov\u00f5es\n\nP.

In this highly \n\nurbanized areas, the winter flow was 2-4 times higher than in dry periods, whereas in the \n\nother drainage areas, less urbanized, the seasonal difference in the measured flows was \n\ngreater, and reached flows 21 time higher during wet period\u2019s storms than summer flows \n\nin Quinta.    \n\nImpermeable surfaces have been widely reported to generate overland flow and to \n\nincrease hydrological connectivity (Tang et al., 2005; Meij\u00eda and Moglen, 2009). \n\nHowever, in sandstone areas, despite the runoff coefficient increased with the urban area, \n\nthe correlation with the impermeable surfaces was rather weak (Figure 5.31b). This may \n\nbe attributable to differences in the urbanization pattern, particularly in Esp\u00edrito Santo \n\nand in the overall catchment (ESAC), which affect flow connectivity over the landscape. \n\nEsp\u00edrito Santo drains a small area with greatest urban cover (Figure 5.6). Within this \n\nurban area, mostly represented by older houses, the storm runoff from the impermeable \n\nsurfaces was dispersed in soils between the impermeable urban surfaces or downslope \n\nagriculture and woodland areas. The absence of storm drainage systems are typical in \n\noldest urban cores. In urban areas, the location in the landscape between overland flow \n\ndelivery and the stream network seems to be an important parameter affecting the flow \n\nconnectivity and the catchment discharge. \n\nOver the study period, despite the great urbanization within Quinta (urban areas increased \n\nfrom 9 to 25%), mainly associated to the upstream enterprise park construction, storm \n\nrunoff did not increase (9%, Figure 5.17b). This may be attributed to the minor surface \n\nsealing of the under construction enterprise park (70% of the area was bare soil, Figure \n\n5.7). In addition, overland flow generated in the impermeable surface could infiltrated in \n\nnearby soils or was diverted to the detention basin. Nevertheless, the detention basin was \n\ndesigned to reduce the flood peak by temporarily storing the excess stormwater and then \n\nreleasing the water volume at allowable rates over an extended period (Ravazzani et al., \n\n2014). Apart from the enterprise park, the remaining urban cores established within \n\nQuinta were mostly dispersed in upslope woodland and/or agricultural fields, enhancing \n\nthe infiltration opportunities before overland flow could reach the stream network. On the \n\nother hand, in Cov\u00f5es, the 2% enlargement of the urban area during the study period \n\n(Figure 5.6) led to a storm runoff coefficient increase from 3% to 9% (Figure 5.17b). \n\nHowever, the new impermeable surfaces were mostly in downslope locations, where the \n\nstormwater from roads and rooftops (released on sidewalks) was partially routed to the \n\nstream channel. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \u2013 INFLUENCE OF THE URBANIZATION PATTERN ON STREAMFLOW OF A \n\nPERI-URBAN CATCHMENT UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE \n\n \n\n158 \n\n \n\na) b) \n\n  \nc) d) \n\n  \ne) f) \n\n  \n\n  Figure 5.31 - Contrasting stormwater management strategies: a) overland flow runs freely to \n\ndownslope agricultural or b) woodland soils; c) storm drainage systems collect and deliver \n\noverland flow into the stream network, downslope section of ESAC catchment and d) \n\ndownslope Drabl; and e) stream channelization within downstream Porto Bordalo and f) Drabl. \n\n \n\nAlthough impermeable surfaces generate overland flow, several urban features may \n\nobstruct water passage to downslope, breaking the flow connectivity. Surface water \n\nretention may occur due to: 1) tanks used to store channelized streamflow for irrigation \n\npurposes (Figure 5.32a); 2) surface depressions promoted by soil movement in \n\nconstruction areas (Figure 5.32b); and 3) embarkments such as roads constructed above \n\nnatural terrain level (Figure 5.32c), houses and walls constructed in topographic lows \n\n(Figure 5.32d). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n159 \n\na) b) \n\n  \nc) d) \n\n            \n                                e)  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.32 - Urbanization features that provide surface water retention: a) tank used for \n\nirrigation purposes (~700m3), b) surface depression within a construction site (~1100m3), c) \n\ndetention basin, d) overland flow retention promoted by walls, and e) road embarkment.    \n\n \n\nMost of these urban features were located in Porto Bordalo and led to a lack of \n\nconnectivity between sources of overland flow and the stream network. This surface water \n\nretention explains the lower increase of stream discharge during wettest conditions, when \n\nsaturation was observed in some upslope sites. Also an increase of urban areas from 35 \n\nto 42% only increased impermeable surfaces by 2%. Most of the flow which reached \n\nPorto Bordalo gauging station represents overland flow diverted by the storm drainage \n\nsystem installed in downslope urban areas.  \n\nThe area between Porto Bordalo and Drabl gauging stations, despite only representing \n\n26% of Drabl drainage area, provided 51% of its stormflow. This was not only because \n\nof the lack of connectivity within Porto Bordalo, but also because the great connectivity \n\nwithin this highly urbanized area (encompasses nearly 80% of the Drabl urban area), \n\npromoted by the storm drainage system (Figures 5.32c and 5.32d). The greater flow \n\nconnectivity provided by the storm drainage system within the urban areas was also \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \u2013 INFLUENCE OF THE URBANIZATION PATTERN ON STREAMFLOW OF A \n\nPERI-URBAN CATCHMENT UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE \n\n \n\n160 \n\nobserved in the downslope ESAC drainage area (below Drabl and Ribeiro da P\u00f3voa \n\ngauging stations), covering 19% of the catchment area. This area was characterized by \n\n50% urban land-use and was largely served by a storm drainage system (road runoff \n\ncollection), leading to 15% contribution to the catchment storm flow. The downstream \n\npart of Ribeiro da P\u00f3voa (21% of the drainage area), despite being ~35% urban, supplied \n\nonly 20% of the gauging station stormflow. This lower contribution from the urban areas, \n\nmay be a result of a lower storm drainage system coverage, such that part of the overland \n\nflow generated finds its way to downslope soils where it infiltrates and fails to reach the \n\nstream network. \n\nOnly a few studies have investigated the effect of urban areas and impermeable surfaces, \n\nand their spatial arrangement, on runoff volume, as well as the impact of storm drainage \n\nsystem. In a catchment in Indiana, USA, Tang et al. (2005) demonstrated the greater \n\nimpact on runoff volume from urban growth dominated by commercial and high density \n\nresidential uses, compared with the low density residential areas. Several researchers have \n\nfound, through statistical analyses of field data, that some types of urbanization had no \n\ndiscernible effects on peak-flows or floods (Dudley et al., 2001). Despite an 161% \n\nincrease in catchment imperviousness from 1.3 to 3.5% in a 34 km2 catchment located in \n\nsouthern Maine, Dudley et al. (2001) found that there was no significant change in peak \n\nflows and hydrograph shape. Hammer (1972) also reported the small effect of impervious \n\nareas associated with detached houses, unless the gutters connect directly with storm \n\nsewers. Storm drainage systems result in little opportunity for infiltration. These impacts \n\nwere also reported in the review of impacts of impervious surfaces on catchment \n\nhydrology (Shuster et al., 2014). Through modelling, Zhang and Shuster (2014) also \n\ndemonstrated that increasing distance to the stream is associated with weaker \n\nconnectivity, because of the infiltration opportunities downslope. Complex interplays \n\nbetween spatial distributions of soil, impervious area and catchment shape may result in \n\nconsiderable differences within catchments in the changes of runoff behaviour in \n\nresponse to urbanization. \n\nIncreasing imperviousness tends to enhance the depth and speed of overland flow by \n\ndiminishing infiltration and leading to quicker response time (Zhang and Shuster, 2014). \n\nHowever, the location and the characteristics of the urban cores, particularly the presence \n\nor absence of storm drainage systems, also have an important impact on the response \n\ntime. Drabl and Esp\u00edrito Santo, with the largest percentage of urban areas, reached peak \n\nflows in less than 20 minutes (Figure 5.26). Nevertheless, Drabl drains a considerable \n\nlarger area than Esp\u00edrito Santo, but in Drabl the stream network receives water mostly \n\nfrom downslope urban areas, mainly via storm drainage system, whereas in Esp\u00edrito Santo \n\noverland flow runs over the surface because of the absence of storm drainage system. A \n\nreduced response time during storm events was also found in Porto Bordalo and Cov\u00f5es. \n\nDespite draining smaller urban areas, the flow reaching the gauging stations was mostly \n\nsupplied by the downslope impermeable surfaces and discharged by storm drainage \n\nsystems a few metres above the gauging stations. In addition, the peak flows in Porto \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n161 \n\nBordalo represented a considerable fraction of the Drabl peak flow. Peak flows in Drabl \n\nwere reached, in median, only 5 minutes later than Porto Bordalo sub-catchment, located \n\n~700 m upstream. The quick flow between these gauging stations was favoured by the \n\nartificial channelization of the stream (Figure 5.31e and 5.31f), which is used to carry \n\nexcess water rapidly away (Baker et al., 2004). The downstream Ribeiro da P\u00f3voa and \n\nESAC gauge stations, draining larger areas partially covered by storm drainage systems, \n\nrequired in median 40-50 minutes to reach the peak flows. In natural catchments, larger \n\nstreams are usually less flashy than small ones, due to hydrograph mixing accompanying \n\nflood routing through stream networks and other scale dependent runoff factors (Baker et \n\nal., 2004). In Quinta, longer response time (~50 minutes) was probably due to in part to \n\nthe distance of the upslope urban cores from the stream network, as the overland flow \n\nfrom impermeable surfaces flowed into the downslope woodland soil and infiltrated \n\nbefore reachig the stream network, as refered on section 5.4.3.2.3.. Also in the recent \n\nenterprise park area, overland flow was diverted from the detention basin which delays \n\nthe peak flow observed in Quinta gauging station. According with Baker et al. (2004), \n\nthe construction of storm runoff holding basins is a water management practice that could \n\nshift flow regimes back toward a more natural condition. \n\nAn urbanization impact on the recession time of storm events was not perceived (Figure \n\n5.27), possibly due to different sizes of the drainage areas (ESAC and Ribeiro da P\u00f3voa \n\nwith largest areas showed longer recession time), but also due to differences in the \n\noverland flow drainage systems. Previous studies reported reduced recession time in \n\ndownslope areas of the catchment, in larger streams, as a result of the storm drainage \n\nsystems on rapid transportation of runoff, which mask the effect of the natural drainage \n\n(Baker et al., 2004). A study performed by Hood et al. (2007) also reported increased lag \n\ntimes in areas with low impact development, associated with disconnected impervious \n\nareas, than traditional residential development. \n\nGenerally, the study of Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment showed that peri-urbanization, \n\ncharacterized by dispersed urban cores and low imperviousness, enhance the lack of flow \n\nconnectivity within the landscape, favouring the maintenance of a more natural \n\nstreamflow, associated with minor stormflows and larger recession time. On the other \n\nhand, urbanization styles favouring extensive impervious surface will enlarge streamflow \n\nduring rainfall events, particularly if runoff is piped to the stream network. This type of \n\nurbanization, mostly associated with recent urban cores, can have detrimental impacts on \n\nflood hazard, particularly if downslope areas are occupied by urban land-uses. Few past \n\nflood events affected downslope urban areas located adjacent to the watercourse. The \n\nenlargement of impervious surface within urban areas, mainly located downslope and \n\nsupplied by artificial drainage systems, can enlarge the flood risk within these areas.        \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \u2013 INFLUENCE OF THE URBANIZATION PATTERN ON STREAMFLOW OF A \n\nPERI-URBAN CATCHMENT UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE \n\n \n\n162 \n\n5.5.4. Spatial pattern of urbanization and stormwater management: \n\nproblems and future challenges \n\nActual landscape arrangement within Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es comprises urban areas mainly \n\nalong ridges and downslope catchment (Figure 5.8). Urbanization pattern over the last \n\ndecades created distinctive urban settings characterized by different extension of \n\nimpermeable and semi-permeable surfaces, with storm runoff routed to the stream \n\nnetwork naturally (following the topography) or through artificial drainage systems. \n\nDischarge measurements performed in different sections of the stream network revealed \n\ngenerally low annual runoff coefficients. Streamflow increased with the urban land-use \n\ncover, but it was affected by the presence or absence of storm drainage systems, and the \n\ndistance between the source or the storm discharge and the stream network. Urban \n\nfeatures, such as houses, walls and road embankments, particularly in valley bottoms \n\nprovided surface water retention, breaking the flow connectivity between the sources and \n\nthe stream network. Analyses of storm events revealed greater flows under antecedent \n\nwettest conditions, demonstrating the increased surface and subsurface connectivity as \n\nsoil moisture increases. The limited retention capacity provided by urban features may \n\nrepresent an additional flood hazard, since they may be exceeded by overland flow in \n\nmajor rainstorms.  \n\nOn 25th October 2006 an extreme daily rainfall event of 102.1 mm led to floods. \n\nAccording to Brand\u00e3o et al. (2001), in Coimbra, rainfall events of 93.6 mm day-1 and \n\n112.2 mm day-1 have return periods of 10- and 50-years respectively. Flood damage \n\nincluded the collapse of walls and costs linked to the flooding of houses in topographic \n\nlows. The collapse and \u201cdam failure\u201d of urban features which usually retained storm \n\nrunoff exacerbated the problem of downslope and downstream areas. It is unclear if the \n\nmajor flood driver was urbanization or extreme rainfall, but according to older local \n\nresidents, other significant flood events were reported about 50 and 80 years ago. \n\nThe presence of the storm drainage systems and the partial channelization of the stream \n\nnetwork leads to quicker runoff concentrations in downslope areas. Althoug the median \n\nresponse time of the catchment was 40 minutes, sub-catchment gauging stations with \n\ndownslope urban areas (Porto Bordalo, Drabl and Cov\u00f5es), reached peak flows in less \n\nthan 20 minutes. This flashy response of the catchment highlight the problem of the local \n\nauthorities to activate timely warning and alert systems.   \n\nHowever, within Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, problems with storm management were not only \n\nobserved in the downstream section of the catchment, where flow depths are usually \n\ngreater. The lack of capacity of the stream network and/or hydraulic infrastructures \n\nlocated upslope also caused occasional inconvenience for local population. These \n\nproblems were driven by the partial obstruction of culverted drains with sediments and/or \n\nplant material (Figure 5.33a), and the limited flow capacity of some stream sections \n\n(Figure 5.33b). These problems were identified mainly near Quinta gauging station, and \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n163 \n\nare recognized by the local residents as an increasing problem after the construction \n\nactivities in the upslope enterprise park. The deforestation of a considerable area \n\nincreased the overland flow and although the retention basin stores most of this and \n\nreleases it after a delay, the flow capacity of the downslope stream is not enough to carry \n\nall the additional runoff promoted by the urbanization process. Damages has been \n\nreported in the downslope agricultural fields, in terms of crop losses and soil erosion. \n\n \n\na) b) \n\n  \n\n  Figure 5.33 - Problems with current storm drainage system: a) decreased flow capacity of drain \n\npipes due to sediment deposition, and b) limited flow capacity by artificial bottleneck of the \n\nstream channel. \n\n \n\nProjected urban changes indicate a substantial development within the catchment for the \n\nnear future, mainly in the upper catchment, with the enlargement of the enterprise park \n\narea. This additional urbanization will enhance even more the runoff and reduce water \n\ninfiltration opportunities, exacerbating the actual problems of stormwater management. \n\nTo minimize these problems it would be necessary to enlarge the river bed, particularly \n\ndownslope the enterprise park. However, this will bring social resistance since the stream \n\nflows through private properties, and expropriation processes or loss of private land is \n\nalways difficult to accept, at least in Portugal. On the other hand, it is also important that \n\nresponsible authorities provide adequate maintenance and cleaning of the river bed and \n\nhydraulic structures. But different authorities are responsible for the stormwater \n\nmanagement across the catchment. For instance, local authorities are responsible for the \n\nstream bed, municipal water authority is responsible for the storm drainage system, \n\nwhereas hydraulic structures associated with the major road construction belong to the \n\nnational semi-private authority responsible for the national roads. The involvement of \n\ndifferent legal authorities within the same catchment is not easy and represents a \n\nmanagement challenge, particularly within a national scenario of economic crises.  \n\nAn additional challenge is related to the stream network flowing mainly through private \n\nproperties, some of them fenced without easy access, which makes intervention by the \n\nauthorities difficult. Thus, landowners sometimes take actions which affect the \n\nstreamflow. For example, in 2014, a landlord decided to install small branches and trunks \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \u2013 INFLUENCE OF THE URBANIZATION PATTERN ON STREAMFLOW OF A \n\nPERI-URBAN CATCHMENT UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE \n\n \n\n164 \n\nin the stream channel, few metres upstream Ribeiro da P\u00f3voa gauging station, within his \n\nproperty, in order to prevent bank erosion. However, this led to a local reduction of the \n\nflow capacity and flooding of the surrounding land. In the past, private owners were \n\nresponsible for maintenance of the river bed, and they could be fined if inappropriate \n\nmanagement was performed. The loss of this landowners\u2019 responsibility and restricted \n\nmaintenance by the authorities has accentuated the state of degradation of many \n\nPortuguese rivers. Another problem resulting from rivers flowing through private \n\nproperties is associated with illegal constructions close to the streams. For example, a \n\nprivate house under construction in the river bed, involved local stream diversion a few \n\nmetres above Esp\u00edrito Santo gauging station. Despite national legislation forbiden \n\nconstruction activities within 100 m of a river (Lei n\u00ba58/2005), cases like this do occur. \n\nThe current houses and walls installed in valley bottoms of Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es should be \n\nof increasing concern in a continuous urbanization process, not only because of the social \n\nexpropriation problems already discussed, but also for the economic and social fragilities \n\nof these local residents.  \n\nAppropriate stormwater management is required to minimize the runoff increment \n\nprovided by additional urbanization. This requires a complement to the actual and the \n\nabove stated measures associated with the current storm drainage system. Additional \n\nmeasures may include dry detention ponds to store and delay runoff excess in the \n\nlimestone areas, infiltration basins within sandstone areas (based on greater infiltration \n\ncapacities of sandstone than limestone soils) and use of permeable pavements in the new \n\nurban cores. These structures and measures would diminish increases in peak discharge \n\nand runoff volume, as well as increases lag times and retention of smaller and more \n\nfrequent rainfall events (Baker et al., 2004; Hood et al., 2007; Loperfido  et al., 2014). \n\nStructural measures, however, need to be complemented with non-structural measures, \n\nsuch as adequate land management and urban planning at the catchment level. The \n\nmagnitude of the potential benefits of land-use planning based on water resource impacts, \n\nin particular on runoff processes and systems affected by runoff processes, is largely \n\nunknown. A few studies, however, have been demonstrating the potential of distributed \n\nhydrological models to investigate the hydrological impacts of new urban areas. Zheng \n\nand Baetz (1999) evaluated design alternatives for new urban cores and found that designs \n\nwith smaller total development area can effectively reduce the increase of peak flows and \n\ntotal runoff volumes due to development, when compared with less efficient designs. \n\nMoglen et al. (2003) suggested a framework for quantifying smart growth in land \n\ndevelopment in which the runoff impact was reduced by minimizing the total area change \n\nin imperviousness. Both studies revealed that the impact of development can be reduced \n\nby limiting the total impervious area. Ravazzani et al. (2014) used a distributed \n\nhydrological model to evaluate the impacts of downstream detention basins, in order to \n\ninvestigate the best location within the urbanized catchment to install them. Nonetheless, \n\nthe magnitude that runoff can be minimized depends on site specific land-use types, soil \n\nproperties and the urbanization level of a catchment. Smart growth is being promoted as \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n165 \n\na progressive approach to development. One of the goals of smart growth is water \n\nresources protection, in particular minimizing the impact of urban sprawl on runoff and \n\nsystems affected by runoff processes (Tang et al., 2005) \n\n \n\n5.6. Conclusions \n\nLand-use changes, particularly associated with peri-urbanization have affected the \n\nhydrological processes. In Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment, although urban surfaces cover \n\nnear 40% of the catchment area annual runoff coefficient did not exceed 22%. This \n\nchapter highlighted the importance of distinct biophysical properties, such as weather, \n\nlithology and urban style and its distribution over a catchment on streamflow variation: \n\n1. Runoff is mainly generated by infiltration-excess overland flow processes, dominant \n\nduring dry conditions, and by saturation and subsurface lateral flow during wet \n\nweather. Through wet season, increasing surface and subsurface flow connectivity, \n\npromoted by soil moisture rise, led to highest storm runoff coefficients in late winter. \n\nHowever, in Ribeiro da P\u00f3voa (mainly sandstone) and Cov\u00f5es (mostly limestone), \n\nstorm runoff coefficients were higher in the summer, possibly due to infiltration-excess \n\npromoted by woodland hydrophobic soils. \n\n2. Sandstone areas showed a perennial regime, with few days without flow even in \n\ndriest periods, and with baseflow representing 30% to 40% of the annual flow. Streams \n\nin limestone areas were only active during rainfall events, except Drabl which is \n\nlocated downslope, showing a continuous trickle flow. Thus, baseflow delivered by \n\nthe limestone areas represented ~2% of the annual catchment baseflow. During storm \n\nevents, limestone areas provided a greater contribution to the peak flow at the \n\ncatchment outlet than sandstone areas. Quicker response time in limestone than \n\nsandstone sub-catchments were found (<15 minutes vs. 15-50 minutes). \n\n3. Considering the results from gauging stations installed in similar lithology, storm \n\nrunoff coefficients over the study period increased with the urban cover and provided \n\nquicker peak flows. In sandstone areas storm runoff coefficients ranged from 9% in \n\nQuinta, with 9% urban area, and 21% in Esp\u00edrito Santo, represented by 23% urban \n\nsurface. Overlaying limestone, storm runoff coefficients ranged from 3% in Cov\u00f5es, \n\nwith a 15% urban area, to 18% in Drabl, encompassing 47% urbanization.  \n\n4. Over the study period, the urbanization impact on streamflow at the catchment outlet \n\nand upstream gauging stations varied according with the type of urbanization, \n\nparticularly if it was patchy and dispersed within the landscape or not, the distance to \n\nthe stream network and the type of storm drainage system. An urban area increase of \n\nabout 2% (from 15% to 17%), mainly located downslope and with storm runoff being \n\npiped to the stream led to a storm runoff increase from 3% to 9% in Cov\u00f5es. On the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \u2013 INFLUENCE OF THE URBANIZATION PATTERN ON STREAMFLOW OF A \n\nPERI-URBAN CATCHMENT UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE \n\n \n\n166 \n\nother hand, an urban cover increase from 9% to 25% (Quinta), in upslope locations \n\nand with storm runoff coefficient being diverted to downslope urban and woodland \n\nsoils, did not have a discernible impact on storm runoff coefficient (14%). The type of \n\nurbanization also plays an important impact on the storm reponse time, with \n\ndownslope urban areas connected to artificial storm drainage system reaching the peak \n\nflow in 5 minutes (Cov\u00f5es), wereas in larger areas with upslope dispersed urban cores \n\nit takes 40 minutes (Ribeiro da P\u00f3voa and ESAC). When storm runoff runs freely \n\nand/or is diverted into pervious soils it may be infiltrated. Furthermore, surface water \n\nretention, either provided by vegetated surfaces or urban infrastructures (e.g. \n\nembarkments and walls), may break flow connectivity and/or retard its downslope \n\ntransfer, minimizing the impact of urbanization on streamflow.  \n\nThe creation of local opportunities for water infiltration, provided by an appropriate \n\nurbanization pattern, associated with the size and position of urban developments on the \n\nlandscape, the degree of sealing and the strategy for stormwater management (storm \n\ndrainage system and the location where runoff is delivered within the landscape), should \n\nbe considered in catchment management and urban planning. This is of utmost \n\nimportance to break the flow connectivity and minimize flood hazard. However, \n\nidentifying the best arrangement of urban patches whilst maximizing the use of land for \n\nurban development needs now to be a research priority. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n167 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6  \n\nASSESSING SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF \n\nSTREAMWATER CHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN \n\nMEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION TO \n\nRAINFALL EVENTS \n\n6.1.

In this study, the impact of land-use pattern was investigated \n\nthrough surface water quality assessment in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, a peri-urban \n\ncatchment (615 ha) in central Portugal, with a 40% urban cover. Besides catchment \n\noutlet, surface water quality was monitored in three upstream locations, encompassing \n\ndifferent drainage areas (56 \u2013 150 ha). Two of the sub-catchments are of similar \n\npercentage urban cover (42% and 49%) but different lithologies (sandstone and \n\nlimestone), whereas the third is of lower urban extent (25%) and includes a construction \n\nsite covering 10% of its drainage area. Numerous surface water samples were collected \n\nduring ten rainfall events (of different amount and intensity), between October 2011 \n\nand March 2013. Several chemical parameters, including nutrients, major cations and \n\nmetals were analysed. The results were compared with Portuguese national water \n\nquality guidelines for environmental and irrigation uses, and the spatio-temporal \n\nvariation of pollutant loads was assessed. The outcomes of the study highlight the \n\ncomplexity of spatio-temporal impact on surface water quality, particularly considering \n\nthe variations of analytical parameters between sites. Generally, chemical loads per unit \n\narea increased in the study site with greater urban land-use extent. Parameters such as \n\nEC, COD, NO2+NO3, Ca, Mg and K on dissolved phase of surface water also increased \n\nwith percentage impervious surface. The role of hydrological connectivity between \n\npollutant sources and the stream network is discussed. COD, nutrients (Nk, NH4, \n\nNO2+NO3 and TP) and Mn attained highest concentrations during the first rainfall \n\nevents after the summer, as a result of lower dilution effect provided by the low \n\ndischarge. Standards for minimum water quality and recommended guidelines for \n\nirrigation practices were occasionally exceeded, not only during low flow conditions, \n\nbut also in wettest settings. Further monitoring is required for a fuller understanding of \n\nthe spatio-temporal changes of water quality. The information gained, however, should \n\nguide sustainable landscape management and urban planning, in order to avoid \n\nconflicts between urban development and water quality degradation in peri-urban \n\ncatchments. \n\n \n\nKeywords: land-use, rainfall, connectivity, spatio-temporal variation, surface water \n\nquality \n\n6.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6 \u2013 ASSESSING SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF STREAMWATER \n\nCHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION \n\nTO RAINFALL EVENTS \n\n \n\n170 \n\n6.1. Introduction \n\nThe replacement of natural land surfaces, including woodland and agricultural areas, by \n\nimpervious coverage, such as paved roads, car parks and roofs, leads to significant \n\nchanges on both quantity and quality of the stormwater runoff, with deleterious impacts \n\non stream ecosystems (e.g. Arnold and Gibbons, 1996; Brilly et al., 2006). Urban runoff \n\nhas been considered a major non-point source of pollutants within catchments (Wahl et \n\nal., 1997; Schoonover and Lockaby, 2006; Yu et al., 2012). Research studies have \n\nidentified high loads of heavy metals from industrial sources (Pitt and Maestre, 2005; Qin \n\net al., 2013), roads and vehicular traffic (Ellis et al., 1986; Emmenegger et al., 2004; \n\nGilbert and Clausen, 2006; Li et al., 2012) and material corrosion (Neff et al, 1987). \n\nOrganic matter, nutrients and pathogenic microorganisms have been also found with \n\ngreater concentrations within urban areas due to sewage contaminations, resulting from \n\nseptic tanks (Gold et al., 1990; Steffy and Kilham, 2004), combined sewer systems \n\n(Gromaire et al., 2001; Soonthornnonda et al., 2008; Mannina and Viviani, 2009), sewage \n\nleaks (Le Pape et al., 2013) and discharge of wastewater treatment plants (Yu et al., 2014). \n\nIn addition, high loads of nutrients and the presence of pesticides have also been identified \n\nin the runoff from pervious urban surfaces, such as lawns and golf courses, as a result of \n\ninappropriate management, linked to fertilization and irrigation activities (Steuer et al., \n\n1997; Khai et al., 2007). Soil erosion also represent a significant source of suspended \n\nsediments, as well as nutrients and heavy metals in particulate forms (Line et al., 2002; \n\nGoonetilleke et al., 2005; Atasoy et al, 2006). These contaminants will have a detrimental \n\nimpact upon water quality and aquatic organisms. \n\nIt is usually accepted that pollutant loads increase with the percentage of total impervious \n\narea (Arnold and Gibbons, 1996; Morse et al., 2003; Kuusisto-Hjort and Hjort, 2013). \n\nHowever, the impact of different urban cores configuration (e.g. isolated houses with \n\ngardens vs townhouses) and their location within catchments have been recognised as \n\nimportant parameters affecting pollutant transport and water quality impacts (e.g. \n\nCorbetts et al., 1997). Based on a study performed in Queensland, Australia, Goonetilleke \n\net al. (2005) observed greater pollutant load from detached houses than multifamily \n\ndwelling units, due to a greater extent of road surface area and higher nitrogen \n\nconcentrations resulting from gardens extension and fertilise use in detached housing \n\nareas comparing with high-density residential development. Main roads and industrial \n\nareas have been also associated with greater suspended sediments and heavy metals than \n\nresidential, open spaces and commercial areas (Pitt and Maestre, 2005). In addition, the \n\nlocation within the landscape can play a significant role on streamwater quality impact. \n\nUrban areas located downslope may provide runoff flowing into the stream network, \n\nwhereas runoff from upslope areas may be infiltrated and/or retained in downslope \n\npervious areas (Groffman et al., 2004; Wilson and Weng, 2010; Carey et al., 2011), if the \n\nnatural drainage is not replaced by artificial drainage systems. \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n171 \n\nThe complex landscape of peri-urban areas, characterized by a mosaic of different land-\n\nuses and urban infrastructures, determines the potential sources and sinks of pollutants \n\nand the impacts on streamwater quality (Booth and Jackson, 1997; Brabec et al. 2002; \n\nGroffman et al., 2004). Despite the importance of knowing potential runoff and pollutant \n\nsources and understanding their connectivity with the stream network, it requires further \n\ninvestigation. Apart from land-use, runoff properties can vary significantly with rainfall \n\ncharacteristics, such as the amount and intensity (Memon et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2014). \n\nFor example, Rodr\u00edguez-Blanco et al. (2013) observed that 68% of phosphorus transport \n\nocurred in storm events. In a small catchment of Macau, chemical oxygen demand (COD) \n\nranged between 41 and 464 mg L-1 during five rainfall events (Huang et al., 2007). Inter-\n\nstorm variability observed in a typical urbanizing area of China also leaded to mean COD \n\nconcentration with 5-folder difference (Qin et al., 2013). Furthermore, the length of \n\nAntecedent Dry Period (ADP) may greatly affect runoff discharge and its characteristics, \n\ndue to pollutant accumulation, from atmospheric deposition (Sullivan et al., 1978; Valiela \n\net al., 1997; Easton and Petrovic, 2004) from natural sources (e.g. pollen) and human \n\nactivities, such as vehicular traffic (Bannerman et al., 1993; Li et al., 2012). During \n\nrainfall events, pollutants are totally or partially washed-off, depending on rainfall \n\ncharacteristics. Rainfall intensity determines the available energy to overcome surface \n\nresistance (Athayde et al., 1982), whereas rainfall volume affects the removal rates and \n\npollutant dilution (Helsel, 1978). Higher pollutant concentration during dry seasons have \n\nbeen reported by several authors (Barbosa and Hvitved-Jacobsen, 1999; Zhang et al., \n\n2007), but the influence of climate on temporal variability of pollutant load and its \n\ninfluence on streamwater quality is not fully understood.     \n\nThe main aim of this part of the study is to investigate the impact of different land-uses \n\nand distinct urbanization patterns, typical of Portuguese peri-urban areas, on surface \n\nwater quality during storm events. The specific objectives are to: 1) assess spatio-\n\ntemporal variability of several physical-chemical parameters (including solids, nutrients, \n\nmajor cations and metals) of the streamwater, during different rainfall events; 2) explore \n\nthe influence of rainfall pattern on chemical loads; 3) verify if the monitored parameters \n\nexceed Portuguese minimum surface water quality and irrigation water uses; and 4) \n\ndiscuss the influence of land-use pattern on streamwater quality.  \n\nKnowledge of spatio-temporal variability of potential runoff and pollutant sources and \n\nsinks are relevant to guide decision-makers and policy actors to implement the most \n\nsuitable solutions to achieve good water quality and preserve aquatic ecosystems. \n\nHowever, understanding the relationship between land-uses and physical-chemical runoff \n\nproperties, and how they change before reach the stream network, is essential for urban \n\nplanning and catchment management, in order to prevent water quality degradation within \n\nperi-urban areas. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6 \u2013 ASSESSING SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF STREAMWATER \n\nCHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION \n\nTO RAINFALL EVENTS \n\n \n\n172 \n\n6.2. Study Area \n\nThe Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es study area has been characterized by a fast urbanization process, \n\nlinked to population increase from about 2500 to 8000 inhabitants between 1958 and \n\n2011. Nowadays, the land-use is largely dominated by woodland areas (56%), with a \n\nsignificant urban cover (40%) and only minor sparse agricultural fields (4%). Urban land-\n\nuse comprises mostly residential areas, including some leisure areas, commercial \n\nbuildings (small supermarkets and pastry shops), educational and health services, \n\nincluding a central hospital, and few facilities (garage shops, sawmill and a pharmaceutic \n\nindustry). An enterprise park, covering 5% of the catchment area, is under construction \n\nin the catchment headwaters. A network of roads extends across the catchment, covering \n\n7% of its area, and includes a recent motorway. Residential areas comprise distinct urban \n\ncores with contrasting urbanization styles, marked by single-family houses, most of them \n\nsurrounded by gardens, and apartment blocks (mostly in downslope catchment). These \n\ndistinct residential areas are linked to contrasting population densities, ranging from&lt;25 \n\ninhabitants km-2 to >9900 inhabitants km-2 (Tavares et al., 2012). Agricultural land-use is \n\ndominated by a few olive plantations, pasture areas with extensive cattle rearing and small \n\nfamily farms. Pasture areas are mostly concentrated along the stream network. \n\nWithin the urban areas, the artificial drainage network encompasses separated systems \n\nfor stormwater and wastewater transport. Urban storm runoff is collected in culverts and \n\ngutters, covering the majority of the road network, and is routed/piped to the main river \n\nor into its tributaries. In urban settlements surrounded by agricultural and woodland soils, \n\nstormwater just dissipates in these areas. Runoff from the enterprise park is partially \n\nrouted to a retention basin and then to a downslope tributary, with a delay during peak \n\nflows. Domestic effluent is piped to a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), located \n\noutside the catchment. However, a small WWTP was installed about 30 years ago within \n\nRibeira dos Cov\u00f5es, in an upslope area, in order to receive the wastewater from a small \n\nurban core. Despite being abandoned several years ago, only recently (~3 years) was it \n\neffectively disabled, with the wastewater being routed to the larger sewer network. During \n\nthis period, sewage was piped to the WWTP infrastructure and released to the surface \n\nwater network. The landowners of downslope agricultural fields reported several \n\ndamages on crop production and irrigation systems during this period. \n\nIn this region, water supply for human consumption is provided by groundwater sources, \n\nwhereas surface water is mostly used for irrigation purposes. \n\n \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n173 \n\n6.3. Methodology \n\n6.3.1. Sampling strategy: spatial and temporal \n\nLocations for surface water sampling were considered in order to assess the influence of \n\ndifferent land-uses, particularly with distinct urban cores. Apart from the catchment outlet \n\n(ESAC), three additional sub-catchment sites were selected upstream: Esp\u00edrito Santo, \n\nembracing an urban land-use associated with high imperviousness intensity; Porto \n\nBordalo, with similar urban extent but sprawl imperviousness; and Quinta, encompassing \n\na minor urban area but covering the enterprise park under construction (covering 10% of \n\nthe drainage area) (Figure 6.1). However, the selected sub-catchments do not differ only \n\nin land-use, but also in the extent of drainage areas and lithology, as shown in Table 6.1. \n\nFlow regime of the selected drainage areas is also distinctive: ESAC has perennial flow, \n\nwhereas the Quinta and Esp\u00edrito Santo streams dry in summer, and Porto Bordalo flow \n\nis ephemeral. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1 - Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment and location of the sampling sites (adapted \n\nfrom Google Earth, 2012). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLegend \n\n Sampling locations \n\n Contributing area \n\nWater lines \n\n Ephemeral \n\n Perennial \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6 \u2013 ASSESSING SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF STREAMWATER \n\nCHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION \n\nTO RAINFALL EVENTS \n\n \n\n174 \n\nTable 6.1 \u2013 Catchment and sub-catchment characteristics: land-use, mean slope and lithology \n\n(S.: sandstone, L.: limestone; A.: alluvial). \n\n \nNOTE: Land-use and land cover was based on Corine Land Cover 2007, and updated through Google Earth Imagery 13/06/2012 and \n\nfield observations. Within the urban areas, impervious surfaces represent sealed soil, such as roads and buildings, semi-pervious \n\nconsists of construction sites, parking zones, courtyards and sidewalks, and pervious surfaces encompasses gardens. Open spaces \n\nconsists of clear-felled areas.  \n\n \n\nSurface water samples were collected during 10 rainfall events, observed between \n\nOctober 2011 and March 2013. Sampling dates were based on weather forecast, in order \n\nto assess rainfall events with different frequency, following dry and wet conditions. Prior \n\nto each rainfall event, whenever possible, one sample was taken from each monitored \n\nsite, if stream was flowing, to provide the base water quality level. Additional samples \n\nwere collected after the rainfall start, in order to assess hydrograph variation (raising limb, \n\npeak discharge and the falling limb). Samples were collected manually. Due to limited \n\nhuman resources, samples were taken at different times in each study site. Time \n\ndifferences ranged between 15 to 30 minutes for equivalent site samples, except in cases \n\nwere no significant flow difference was observed when compared with the previous \n\nsample taken on that specific site. It was considered that rainfall event ended when no \n\nadditional rainfall was observed during a period of 8 h (Asdak et al., 1998). Because of \n\nthe different flow regimes between study sites, the number of water samples was \n\ndissimilar. In total, 76 samples were taken in ESAC, 75 in Porto Bordalo, 56 in Esp\u00edrito \n\nSanto and 58 in Quinta. Each sample was analysed for a large number of water quality \n\nparameters. \n\nRainfall and discharge data were provided by the hydrological network in Ribeira dos \n\nCov\u00f5es. Rainfall data were provided by weighted average values from 5 rainfall tipping-\n\nbuckets (assumed for all the sub-catchments), and discharge data was provided by water \n\nlevel records, with a 5-minutes interval, at each stream gauging station. \n\n \n\n6.3.2. Analytical procedures \n\nGrab water samples were collected into different containers, according with the analytical \n\nparameters. Two-liter polyethylene bottles were used for chemical oxygen demand \n\n(COD), nitrogen, including kjeldahl nitrogen (Nk), ammonium (NH4), and nitric oxide \n\n(NO2+NO3), major cations (such as sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca) and \n\npotassium (K)), and metals (such as iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), cupper (Cu), zinc (Zn) \n\nImpervious Semi-pervious Pervious\n\nESAC (outlet) 615 20 9 10 54 4 3 10 56 41 3\n\nPorto Bordalo 113 15 8 19 55 3 0 12 2 98 0\n\nEsp\u00edrito Santo 56 27 7 15 46 5 0 8 97 0 3\n\nQuinta 150 5 17 3 67 5 3 4 100 0 0\n\nMean \n\nslope \n\n(?)\n\nLand-use / Land cover (%)\n\nSampling site\n\nLithology (%)\n\nArea (ha) Urban\nWoodland\n\nOpen \n\nspaces \nS.

Smaller polyethylene bottles (250 mL) were used for pH, electrical \n\nconductivity (EC), total dissolved solids as NaCl (TDS), turbidity and total solids (TS) \n\nanalysis. Glass bottles (250 mL) were also used to collect samples for total phosphorus \n\n(TP) quantification. Some water quality parameters including pH, EC and TDS were \n\nmeasured on site, using a portable meter (Hach, Sension Portable case). The samples were \n\ntransported to the laboratory in thermal boxes with ice (~4\u00baC) and stored. \n\nIn the laboratory, the 2-L water samples were filtered through a 0.45 ?m nitrocellulose \n\nfilter (Millipore filters), using a vacuum pump, in order to quantify the dissolved fraction \n\nof several chemical elements, as described in Standard Method 3030-E (APHA et al., \n\n1998). Aliquots of filtered samples were then stored in smaller bottles. For major cations \n\nand metals, samples were acidified with nitric acid and frozen until analysis. Samples for \n\nCOD, Nk, NH4 and TP were acidified with sulphuric acid and subsequently frozen. \n\nSamples for nitric oxide were only frozen. Sample storage and preservation was \n\nperformed in accordance with Standard Method 1060-C (APHA et al., 1998). \n\nTurbidity was analysed in the original water samples, using a single beam \n\nspectrophotometer (Hach DR 2000) according with the HACH-8237 method, range 0-\n\n1000 NTU (HACH, 1999). Total solids (TS) were quantified through sample evaporation \n\nat 105\u00baC, until constant weight, following Standard Method 2540-B (APHA et al., 1998). \n\nCOD was quantified by using a low range (0 to 150 mg L-1) kit test (HI 93754A-25, \n\nHanna Instruments). The sample was measured (2 mL) into digestion vials and oxidized \n\nat 150\u00baC during 2h, in a reactor digester (HACH), under acidic conditions. The remaining \n\ndichromate ion concentration was determined through absorbance at 420 nm (Hach DR \n\n2000 spectrophotometer). The method is in accordance with EPA 410.4 and ISO \n\n15705:2002 standards. Total phosphorus was also analysed with a low range (0.00 to 3.50 \n\nmg L-1) test kit (HI 93758A-50, Hanna Instruments). The method is based on acid \n\npersulfate digestion at 150\u00baC over 30 minutes (Hach reactor digester), followed by \n\nreaction with molybdate ascorbic acid and antimony potassium tartrate. Subsequent \n\nquantification was performed at 610 nm (single beam spectrophotometer, Hach DR 2000) \n\n(adapted from EPA 365.2 and 4500-P E Standard Methods). \n\nAnalytical procedure for Tk (including ammonia, organic and reduced nitrogen forms, \n\nexcluding nitrate and nitrite) was based on Standard Method 4500-Norg B (APHA et al., \n\n1998), with samples digestion performed at 400\u00baC, during 2h (J.P.

This method was adjusted from ISO 14255: 1998 and is based \n\non nitrate reduction within a cadmium-cupper column, coupling with N-1-\n\nnapthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride and quantification at 540 nm.  \n\nMajor cations and metals were quantified after digestion with nitric acid, in accordance \n\nwith Standard Method 3030-E (APHA et al., 1998), through ebullition in hotplates. \n\nIndividual chemical elements were than quantified by atomic absorption \n\nspectrophotometry (Perkin Elmer AA300 analyser), with direct air-acetylene flame \n\nmethod and corresponding hollow cathode lamp, in accordance with Standard Method \n\n3111-B (APHA et al., 1998).     \n\nWater samples were defrozen at room temperature before analysis. Some samples \n\nrequired dilution, in order to fit the method range. Reagent blanks and duplicate samples \n\nwere used for quality control purposes and mean concentration values (repeated analysis \n\nof same sample) were used in data analysis. \n\n \n\n6.3.3. Data analysis \n\nThe hydrological regime of the ten sampled rainfall events was characterized in terms of \n\nrainfall and stream discharge. For each rainfall event, the amount, duration and intensity \n\nof the rainfall was calculated. Rainfall intensity was described in terms of the event mean \n\nvalue (Imed) and maxima in 15- and 60- minutes (I15 and I60). Antecedent precipitation \n\nindex values were calculated as the sums of the precipitation in 7 and 14 days prior to \n\neach rainfall event (API7 and API14). Streamflow parameters used included instantaneous \n\nflow (at the time of water sampling) and event flow description. Surface and baseflow \n\ncomponents were also estimated for individual hydrographs, using a mathematical digital \n\nfilter (Nathan and McMahon, 1990). \n\nThe results of surface water quality parameters were visualized by box- and whisker \n\ndiagrams for the four study sites, over the ten rainfall events monitored. Statistical \n\ndifferences between the four study sites were investigated through the analysis of \n\nindividual water qualiy parameters (based in all the sample results of each site), using the \n\nnon-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, since the criteria for normal distribution was not met. \n\nSurface water quality differences over the time were also explored for individual \n\nparameters, considering all the measurements performed in each rainfall events, based on \n\nthe same statistical test. Whenever significant spatial and/or temporal water quality \n\ndifferences were identified, further investigation was carried out with post-hoc Fisher's \n\nLeast Significant Difference test. All the statistical analysis were accomplished for a 95% \n\nconfidence interval. The relationship between individual water quality parameters, and \n\nbetween water quality and the discharge properties at the sampling time (flow, surface \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n177 \n\nand baseflow component at sampling time) were explored using Spearman\u2019s rank \n\ncorrelation coefficient (r). \n\nWater quality parameters were compared with Portuguese guidelines, established for \n\nenvironmental goals of minimum surface water quality, as well as for irrigation uses \n\n(Ministry of Environment, 1998). As regards to irrigation purposes, the results were \n\ncompared with the established maximum recommended values (MRV) and maximum \n\nadmissible values (MAV) defined by the legislation. According with the Portuguese water \n\nirrigation standards, Sodium Adsorption Relation (SAR) parameter was calculated for \n\nindividual water samples (equation 1): \n\nSAR= Na / [(Ca + Mg) /2] \u00bd      (1) \n\nwhere Na is the concentration of sodium; Ca is the concentration of calcium, and Mg \n\nrepresents the concentration of magnesium. All the concentrations are expressed in meq \n\nL-1. \n\nIn order to assess the impact of different rainfall events on water quality, pollutant loads \n\nwere calculated for the four study sites. Event load (EL) was estimated for all quantifiable \n\nparameters analysed, based on weighted mean concentration per rainfall event (EMC) \n\n(equation 2). EMC was calculated using equation 3, adapted from Qin et al. (2010) \n\nmethodology, developed for discrete water samples. \n\nEL = EMC \u00d7 Qt    (2) \n\nwhere EL is the event load, EMC is the event weighted mean concentration, and Qt is the \n\ntotal streamflow during the event. \n\nTotal streamflow represents the cumulative flow during individual sampling events. The \n\nduration of the streamflow was defined by the time between the first and the last water \n\nsample collected in each monitoring date. This assumption does not consider the different \n\nflow regimes between study sites, displayed by dissimilar hydrograph shapes. However, \n\nthis criterion was considered the most adequate for comparison purposes between study \n\nsites, since water samples were collected at different times and distinct stages of the \n\nhydrographs. \n\nEMC = ? (Ci   Qi) / ? Qi       (3) \n\nwhere EMC is the event mean concentration, Ci is the concentration at time i, and Qi is \n\nthe streamflow at time i. \n\nSpecific event loads (SEL) were calculated by dividing EL for the extent of the drainage \n\narea, in order to better assess the impact of different land-uses within the study sites. SEL \n\nrepresents the mass of the physical-chemical property washed off per unit area per rainfall \n\nevent, and describes the area-averaged intensity of runoff property loads. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6 \u2013 ASSESSING SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF STREAMWATER \n\nCHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION \n\nTO RAINFALL EVENTS \n\n \n\n178 \n\nThe impact of hydrological processes and catchment biophysical properties on spatio-\n\ntemporal variation of EMCs and ELs, was explored through Spearman correlation \n\nanalysis (r). The role of the rainfall characteristics (amount, duration, intensity \u2013 including \n\nImed, I15 and I60) on catchment physico-chemical parameters wash-of and their influence \n\non stream water quality was considered, together with the possible effect of build-up \n\nparameters between rainfall events (through the correlation of EMCs and ELs with API7 \n\nand API14). The correlation of EMCs and ELs with sub-catchments total streamflow \n\nduring montitored rainfall events was investigated, as well as the importance of storm \n\nflow on catchment physico-chemical properties wash-off. The baseflow contribution for \n\npotential dilution effect of storm flow physic-chemical properties and/or contribution \n\nwith specific chemical properties were also investigated. The influence of distinct \n\nlithologies (percentage of sandstone and limestone) on different water chemical \n\nparameters was also assessed through the correlation with EMCs and ELs. The \n\nbiophysical properties of the sub-catchments also included the land-use cover (percentage \n\nof woodland, agriculture and urban) and the extent of impervious surfaces (percentage of \n\nthe drainage area). All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 \n\nsoftware. \n\n \n\n6.4. Results and analysis \n\n6.4.1.

Median values \n\nincreased from Porto Bordalo (76.4 mg L-1), to Quinta, (109.4 mg L-1), Esp\u00edrito Santo \n\n(163.6 mg L-1) and ESAC (174.6 mg L-1) (results not shown). Maximum values ranged \n\nbetween 401.0 mg L-1 and 758.0 mg L-1 within the four study sites.  \n\nTurbidity displayed a different spatial pattern than pH, EC and TDS, with greatest values \n\nin Quinta surface water (p<0.05). Over the study period, median turbidity values in \n\nQuinta (134 FTU), were almost twice higher than in ESAC (79 FTU), and about four \n\ntimes the amount found in Esp\u00edrito Santo and Porto Bordalo (38 FTU and 33 FTU, \n\ncorrespondingly) (Figure 6.5). Surface water quality showed significant turbidity \n\nincreases during 02/11/2011 and 14/11/2011 measurements (p>0.05). Nevertheless, \n\nduring these rainfall events, differences in maximum turbidity were not so large between \n\nQuinta and ESAC (1548 FTU and 1127 FTU), but were clearly distinct from Esp\u00edrito \n\nSanto and Porto Bordalo (313 FTU and 493 FTU).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.5 - Temporal variability of turbidity between the four study sites.

Compliance with Portuguese water quality guidelines \n\nAccording with the Portuguese guidelines (Environmental Ministry, 1998) for minimum \n\nsurface water quality, pH (5.0-9.0) and total phosphorus (1 mg L-1) did not represent \n\nproblems for aquatic ecosystems within Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es. However, nitrogen and a \n\nfew heavy metals occasionally threatened surface water quality in all the study sites.  \n\nThe minimum water quality threshold of Nk (2 mg L-1) exceeded in 15% of the Porto \n\nBordalo water samples, 9% in Quinta and 7% in ESAC and Esp\u00edrito Santo. Problems \n\nlinked to high concentrations of Nk were largely observed on 25/09/2012, 08/01/2013 \n\nand 15/01/2013 (Figure 6.10). Some of these high Nk concentrations found in ESAC and \n\nPorto Bordalo, were identified in baseflow samples, before rainfall start, but also during \n\nthe falling limb of the hydrograph. Ammonium standards (1 mg L-1) were surpassed in \n\n8% of ESAC surface water samples, 3% in Porto Bordalo and 2% in Esp\u00edrito Santo. The \n\nhighest NH4 concentrations were linked to Nk maxima.    \n\nCadmium standard (0.01 mg L-1) was surpassed in the only quantifiable sample over the \n\nstudy period, which was collected in ESAC, during the 15/01/2013 rainfall event (raising \n\nlimb). At this time, ESAC also exceeded Cu water quality standards (0.1 mg L-1) in two \n\nsamples. Furthermore, Cu concentration also exceeded the threshold in 2% of the Esp\u00edrito \n\nSanto samples, on 25/03/2013 (during peak flow). Dissolved Zn concentrations also \n\nsurpassed minimum surface water quality guidelines (0.5 mg L-1) in 11% of ESAC water \n\nsamples and 3% in both Porto Bordalo and Quinta, not only on 25/09/2012 (rising limb) \n\nbut also in the 15/01/2013 (peak flow and recession limb) storm events.   \n\nIn the four study sites, recorded values always complied with recommended surface water \n\nquality guidelines for irrigation purposes for NO3 (RMV=50 mg L\n-1), Fe (RMV=5.0 mg \n\nL-1), Zn (RMV=2.0 mg L-1 and MAV= 10.0 mg L-1), and SAR parameter (RMV=8 meq \n\nL-1). Maximum values of SAR attained 3 meq L-1 in Quinta and 2 meq L-1 in ESAC, Porto \n\nBordalo and Esp\u00edrito Santo, over the study period (results not shown). The MRV for TDS \n\n(640 mg L-1) was exceeded on only one sample collected at ESAC, near the peak flow on \n\nlate winter (15/01/2013).  \n\nSurface water quality displayed some limitations for irrigation purposes, associated with \n\ngreatest Cu, Mn and pH values, above the recommended guidelines in some samples. \n\nMaximum recommended values of Cu (0.2 mg L-1) were exceeded in 2% of Esp\u00edrito \n\nSanto water samples, during 25/03/2013 (same samples which exceeded the minimum \n\nwater quality standards). Manganese was surpassed in 4% and 1% of the ESAC and Porto \n\nBordalo water samples (MRV=0.20 mg L-1), due to great concentrations on 25/09/2012 \n\n(measured during the rising limb of the hydrographs). In Porto Bordalo, pH was at MRV \n\n(4.5-9.0) limit in 3% of the analyses (rising limb of 02/11/2010 rainfall event). \n\nNevertheless, in all of these MRV exceedance, the maximum admissible standards \n\n(VMA) were always accomplished (Cu: 5.0 mg L-1, Mn: 10 mg L-1 and pH: 4.5-9.0).  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6 \u2013 ASSESSING SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF STREAMWATER \n\nCHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION \n\nTO RAINFALL EVENTS \n\n \n\n198 \n\nThe high detection limit of the analytical method used for Cd quantification (0.031 mg L-\n\n1), did not allow conclusions concerning to the water quality for irrigation practices \n\n(RMV=0.01 mg L-1 and MAV= 0.05 mg L-1). \n\n \n\n6.4.2.3.

Porto Bordalo, overlying limestone, displayed \n\ngreater median values of pH and TP (both slightly higher than ESAC), and somewhat \n\ngreater concentrations of Zn, but lowest results of Na. In turn, with similar land-use but \n\noverlaying sandstone, Esp\u00edrito Santo exhibited greatest median concentrations of EC, \n\nCOD, NO2+NO3, Na, Mg, K and Fe. On the other hand, within the sandstone drainage \n\narea, partially under construction, Quinta demonstrated the highest median \n\nconcentrations of turbidity and Fe, but the lowest concentrations of COD.  \n\nThe spatial differences on surface water quality can be partially explained by the \n\nbiophysical characteristics of the study sites. Lithology displayed significant correlations, \n\nwith median TS (increased on sandstone, but decreased with limestone, p<0.05) and Mg \n\nmedian concentrations (decreased with limestone, p<0.05), despite de very week \n\ncorrelation with the latter (Table 6.5). Land-use seems to play an important role on surface \n\nwater quality, with percentage woodland significantly correlated with lower medians of \n\nEC, NO2+NO3 and major cations (Na, Mg, Ca and K) (at least at p<0.05) (Table 6.6). \n\nDespite the smaller agricultural fields (including sandstone and limestone), this land-use \n\ndemonstrated positive significant correlations with TS (p<0.05), although rather week \n\ncoefficient. Within urban areas, decreases in TS were significantly correlated with \n\nincreasing % pervious surfaces, such as gardens (p<0.01). On the other hand, percentage \n\nimpervious surfaces, linked to roads and buildings cover, was positively correlated with \n\nEC (p<0.05), NO2+NO3 as well as major cations (Na, Mg, Ca and K) (p<0.01). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6 \u2013 ASSESSING SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF STREAMWATER CHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN \n\nCATCHMENT, IN RELATION TO RAINFALL EVENTS \n\n \n\n202 \n\nTable 6.5 - Spearman\u2019s correlations between median concentrations of the ten sampling events, for the quantifiable water quality parameters with rainfall, \n\ndischarge and drainage area characteristics (n=38).

Increasing rainfall depth lead to significant increases of \n\nZn (p<0.05), but decreases in Fe (p<0.05). Rainfall duration showed positive correlations \n\nwith TP, Nk and Zn (p<0.01), but also negative correlations with pH (p<0.05). \n\nFurthermore, greater mean rainfall intensity reduced TP and Nk (p<0.01). Nonetheless, \n\ngreater maximum rainfall intensity (I60) lessened median EC (p<0.01) and Fe values \n\n(p<0.05). Antecedent rainfall also demonstrated some influence on surface water quality \n\nduring rainfall events, displayed by the positive correlations between API7 and pH \n\n(p<0.05) and negative correlations with median concentrations of NH4 (p<0.01). Apart \n\nfrom pH, API14 was also negatively correlated with Nk and TP (p<0.01). \n\nCumulative values of streamflow per storm event also influenced median concentration \n\nvalues. Iron decreased significantly with increasing total flow, cumulative storm flow and \n\npeak flow (p<0.05). But increasing storm flow favoured median Zn concentrations \n\n(p<0.05). However, when all the water samples were considered together with the \n\ninstantaneous discharge, total and storm flow only led to turbidity increases, as presented \n\non section 6.4.2.1.. Furthermore, cumulative baseflow per storm event provided \n\nsignificant increases in median Mg and Ca concentrations (p<0.05), but decreases on pH \n\n(p<0.05) (Table 6.5).   \n\nSince ESAC represents the largest drainage area, including the upstream sub-catchments, \n\nit showed the greatest loads (Table 6.6), but not the highest specific loads (Table 6.7). \n\nGenerally, over the study period, Esp\u00edrito Santo, with smaller drainage area and larger \n\nurban land-use, demonstrated the higher specific loads of all the parameters quantified, \n\nexcept TS, which was greater in Quinta sub-catchment, encompassing the enterprise park \n\nconstruction site. Quinta also displayed the second larger mean of NH4 and Fe loads, \n\nwhereas for all the other water chemical parameters (except NO2+NO3 and Mg) the \n\nsecond higher specific loads were found in ESAC. The lowest loads per unit area were \n\nperceived in Quinta (TP, NO2+NO3, Mg, Ca, K and Zn) and Porto Bordalo (TS, Nk, \n\nNH4, COD, Na and Fe). These spatial variation of specific loads between study sites did \n\nnot follow the same order as observed for median concentrations, previously reported on \n\nsection 6.4.2.1.. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n205 \n\nTable 6.6 - Event load of quantifiable water quality parameters analysed in the four study sites, \n\nduring the ten rainfall events monitored, including mean and standard deviation per study site. \n\n \n\n23/10/\n\n2011\n\n26/10/\n\n2011\n\n02/11/2\n\n011\n\n14/11/2\n\n011\n\n16/12/\n\n2011\n\n04/05/\n\n2012\n\n25/09/\n\n2012\n\n09/01/2\n\n013\n\n15/01/2\n\n013\n\n25/03/20\n\n13\nMean\n\nStand. \n\ndev.\n\nTS (kg)\n\nESAC 990 422 10624 3083 260 658 3742 1084 6852 21726 4944 6780\n\nP.

In terms of correlations with land-use, SEL of NO2+NO3 and \n\nMg decreased with % woodland (p<0.01), but increased with % urban areas, particularly \n\nimpervious surface extent (p<0.01) (Table 6.8). Within urban land-use, pervious areas did \n\nnot show correlations with surface water quality. As regards to lithology, SEL of Na \n\nincreased significantly with higher % sandstone (p<0.05), despite the week correlation, \n\nbut decreased with % limestone (p<0.01).  \n\nHydrological data demonstrated to be a major parameter influencing specific loads of \n\nsurface water quality parameters (Table 6.8). During storm events, rainfall pattern, \n\nparticularly rainfall amount and duration, showed strong correlations with all specific \n\nloads (p<0.01). Increasing I15 and I60 also leaded to higher SEL, except for NO2+NO3 and \n\nNa. However, API did not seem to influence specific loads of water quality parameters. \n\nDischarge properties (total flow, including storm and baseflow components, as well as \n\nrunoff coefficients per event) significantly correlate with all specific loads (p<0.01). Peak \n\ndischarge revealed lower correlation coefficients than total discharge properties, and it \n\ndid not seem to influence NO2+NO3, COD, Na, Mg and Fe specific loads (p>0.05). \n\nA positive linear correlation between event streamflow and SELs (Figure 6.18) highlight \n\nthe relevance of stream discharge. ESAC no longer showed higher specific loads, but \n\ncontrary, displayed the smallest SELs within Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, linked to the lowest \n\nregression lines (Figure 6.18). Despite the generally higher SELs in Esp\u00edrito Santo, Porto \n\nBordalo showed greatest increases with discharge as regards to TP, Mg, K and Zn loads. \n\nIn turn, Quinta displayed the highest regression line of NH4. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n209 \n\nTable 6.8 \u2013 Spearman\u2019s correlation between specific loads of the ten sampling events, for the \n\nquantifiable water quality parameters with rainfall, discharge and drainage area characteristics \n\n(n=38). \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nTS Pt Nk NH4 NO2+NO3 COD Na Mg Ca K Fe Zn\n\nr .877** .799** .907** .897** .639** .825** .656** .734** .831** .853** .805** .854**\n\nSig.

Discussion \n\n6.5.1. Spatial variation of surface water quality \n\n6.5.1.1. Land-use impacts \n\nThe four study sites, characterized by different land-uses, revealed dissimilar surface \n\nwater quality, although some chemical elements, such as EC, Nk, NO2+NO3 and heavy \n\nmetals, did not show significant spatial variations. Despite the general acceptable water \n\nquality across Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, ocassional pollutant levels were achieved in all the \n\nmeasured sites, as regards to nitrogen and few heavy metals. Kjeldhal nitrogen achieved \n\npollutant levels in few samples of all the study sites (maximum concentrations over the \n\nstudy period reached 2.5 mg L-1 in Esp\u00edrito Santo and Porto Bordalo, 2.6 mg L-1 in ESAC \n\nand 2.8 mg L-1 in Quinta, when the standard is 2.0 mg L-1). Pollutant levels of NH4 (>1.0 \n\nmg L-1) were also attained in few samples of ESAC and Esp\u00edrito Santo (maximum values \n\nof 1.6 mg L-1 and 1.5 mg L-1), with slightly exceedance of the quality standards in Porto \n\nBordalo (1.1 mg L-1). Few measurements of Zn revealed marginal pollutant \n\nconcentrations (0.5 mg L-1) in ESAC (maximum of 0.8 mg L-1), as well as Quinta and \n\nPorto Bordalo (maximum of 0.6 mg L-1 in both sites). In Esp\u00edrito Santo, there was one \n\nsample showing Cu concentrations twice higher than the minimum water quality standard \n\n(maximum of 0.2 mg L-1), but in ESAC, Cd concentration exceeded five times the \n\npollutant levels in one occasion (0.05 mg L-1).   \n\nWithin urban land-uses, impervious surfaces are usually associated with decreasing \n\nsurface water quality. Considering the water quality of the four study sites, median event \n\nloads of EC, COD, NO2+NO3, Mg, Ca and K displayed a linear association with \n\nincreasing TIA (Figure 6.19), despite the correlations were only statistical significant as \n\nregards to NO2+NO3 and Mg.

(2008) demonstrated that despite there being a direct relationship between \n\nurbanization level and the degree of water degradation, this relationship takes the form of \n\nan inverted U-shaped curve, steeper in urban than suburban areas, linked with the \n\neconomic development. After urbanization establishment, environmental concerns start \n\nto rise in economically developed cities, leading to increasing investment in pollution \n\nprevention, particularly, water quality protection.    \n\nDespite pollutant concentrations are of utmost importance for ecosystems status, they are \n\nhighly variable during inter- and intra-storm events, representing environmental risk \n\nduring short periods of time (in few samples), according with Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es results. \n\nBecause of the highly variable concentrations of water quality parameters, pollutant loads \n\ncan be an interesting parameter to consider the longer term impacts on ecossystems. There \n\ncan be high concentrations of pollutants, but if the discharge is low, there would only be \n\na small quantity of pollutant transported, thus having minor environmental impact \n\ncomparing with lower concentrations associated with higher flows. Considering the \n\nsignificant increases of most water quality parameters with increasing drainage area, \n\nnormalized pollutant loads were considered the most appropriate to assess differences \n\nbetween the study sites.  \n\nEC\n\ny = 51.0x + 765.7\n\nR\u00b2 = 0.89\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n0 10 20 30\n\nM\ne\nd\n\nia\nn\n e\n\nv\ne\nn\n\nt \nc\no\nn\n\nc\ne\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n: \n\ntu\nrb\n\nid\nit\n\ny\n (\n\nF\nT\n\nU\n) \n\na\nn\nd\n T\n\nS\n (\n\nm\ng\n L\n\n-1\n)\n\nM\ne\nd\nia\n\nn\n e\n\nv\ne\nn\nt \n\nE\nC\n\n (\nu\nS\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n)\n\nImpervious area (%)\n\nEC Turbidity TS Linear (EC)\n\nNO2+NO3\ny = 0.05x + 0.4\n\nR\u00b2 = 0.81\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nM\ne\nd\n\nia\nn\n\n e\nv\n\ne\nn\n\nt \nc\no\n\nn\nc\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n(m\ng\n\n L\n-1\n\n)\n\nImpervious area (%)\n\nTP Nk NH4 NO2+NO3\n\nCOD\n\ny = 0.42x + 8.2\n\nR\u00b2 = 0.83\n\nMg\n\ny = 0.29x + 0.59\n\nR\u00b2 = 0.79\n\nK\n\ny = 0.12x + 2.71\n\nR\u00b2 = 0.98\n\n0.0\n\n5.0\n\n10.0\n\n15.0\n\n20.0\n\n25.0\n\n30.0\n\n35.0\n\n0 10 20 30M\ne\nd\n\nia\nn\n\n e\nv\n\ne\nn\n\nt \nc\no\n\nn\nc\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n \n\n(m\ng\n\n L\n-1\n\n)\n\nImpervious area (%)\n\nCOD Na Mg\nCa K Linear (COD)\nLinear (Mg) Linear (K)\n\n0.00\n\n0.25\n\n0.50\n\n0.75\n\n1.00\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\nM\ne\nd\n\nia\nn\n\n e\nv\n\ne\nn\n\nt \nc\no\n\nn\nc\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n \n\n(m\ng\n\n L\n-1\n\n)\n\nImpervious area (%)\n\nFe Zn\n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n215 \n\nIn Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, despite the general increase of specific loads with urban extent, \n\nexcept for TS, linear relationships were only observed for TP, NO2+NO3, Ca and Mg \n\n(Figure 6.20).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.20 \u2013 Mean specific event load over the ten sampling periods and percentage urban \n\narea, for quantifiable water quality parameters. \n\n \n\nEsp\u00edrito Santo, with the largest urban land-use (49% of the drainage area and 27% \n\nimpervious surface cover), displayed the highest specific event loads of COD, Nk, \n\nNO2+NO3, Na, K, Fe and Cu.

(2008), urbanized catchments export more nitrogen \n\nat higher but less frequent flows than catchment dominated by woodland, agricultural and \n\nlow-density suburban areas. In fact, in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, highest nutrients \n\nconcentration were measured with peak flow in winter storms, but also under summer \n\nbaseflow conditions due to lower dilution effect. \n\nIn a previous study performed to assess surface water quality in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, \n\nbetween 2004 and 2006, the relation BOD/COD in different stream channels was about \n\n0.1 (Ferreira, 2009). Assuming this relationship was constant over the time, despite the \n\nnearly 10% increase in the urban land-use, based on COD measurements, median BOD \n\nestimations per site (ESAC: 1.3 mg L-1; Porto Bordalo: 1.1 mg L-1; Esp\u00edrito Santo: 1.8 \n\nmg L-1; and Quinta: 1.0 mg L-1) did not indicate organic contamination. However, during \n\ngreat rainfall events observed in late summer (25/09/2012), BOD concentrations could \n\nhave exceeded water quality standards (5 mg L-1, Environmental Ministry, 1998) in all \n\nthe study sites (in 2% of Esp\u00edrito Santo and Quinta samples, 3% and 8% of ESAC and \n\nPorto Bordalo, with maximum values of 6.3 mg L-1, 5.8 mg L-1, 5.6 mg L-1 and 6.2 mg \n\nL-1). \n\nIn the urban land-uses, wastewater has been considered an important source of surface \n\nwater contamination with COD and nutrients (Kaushal et al., 2011; Wilbers et al., 2014). \n\nIn Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, contamination of surface water with untreated domestic \n\nwastewater was identified during field trips (through colour, aspect, and smell), possibly \n\nresulting from small leakages in the drainage system, but also large pipe ruptures. Such \n\ncontamination was observed close to the catchment outlet, but also within Porto Bordalo, \n\nand can be related to the highest COD concentrations and higher median Nk \n\nconcentrations observed in ESAC and Porto Bordalo water samples.          \n\nNevertheless, after Esp\u00edrito Santo, the greatest COD and Nk loads considering event \n\nstreamflow were recorded for the Quinta sub-catchment (Figure 6.18). Considering the \n\nsmaller urban land-use and the existence of sewer drainage system, these results may \n\nindicate past soil contamination from an inactive wastewater treatment plant, which \n\nreceived domestic wastewater from upslope urban cores and spread it downstream \n\nwithout treatment. Possible leaching of contaminants can explain the increasing \n\nconcentrations through the wet season, contrary to the observations at the other study \n\nsites, which exhibited greatest concentrations after the summer. However, high COD and \n\nNk loads within Quinta could be also a consequence of extensive cattle rearing in the \n\nupslope agricultural fields, adjacent to the water channel and close to the sampling \n\nlocation. Surface water contamination by organic compounds in Quinta, was also \n\nindicated by relatively high median concentrations (0.36 mg L-1) and specific loads of \n\nNH4 (545 g km\n-2). In USA, manure management problems regarding to agricultural \n\npractices have been considered a major problem for water quality, particularly during \n\nrainfall events, due to runoff impact on stream network (EPA, 2001). \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n217 \n\nDespite the high NH4 loads recorded in Quinta, concentrations occasionally exceeded the \n\nwater quality standards (1.0 mg L-1) at the other three catchment sites, with larger % urban \n\nland-use. High concentrations of NH4 can be toxic to aquatic organisms (Lin et al., 2014).  \n\nAs regards TP, higher concentrations were found in Porto Bordalo and ESAC (median \n\nvalues of 0.07 mg L-1 for both sites) than in Esp\u00edrito Santo and Quinta (0.06 mg L-1 and \n\n0.04 mg L-1), and greates specific loads in Porto Bordalo (174 g km-2). Phosphorus in \n\nurban areas is usually associated with household sources, such as laundry and dishwasher \n\ndetergents, as well as organic matter biodegradation in domestic wastewater (Mendes and \n\nOliveira, 2004; Carey et al., 2013). In Porto Bordalo, pavement and car washes also may \n\nbe linked with the higher TP loads. Nevertheless, greater TP concentrations in Porto \n\nBordalo and ESAC, can be also related in part perhaps to the higher clay content of the \n\nlimestone soils. The high loads of TS can partially involve suspended sediments from \n\nclay nature, since Porto Bordalo and ESAC overlay fully and partially limestone. The \n\ncontribution of phosphorus in suspended sediments with clay nature was reported by Lin \n\net al. (2014), as a result of adsorptive properties. Furthermore, the downslope location of \n\nESAC can favour high TS loads and sediment deposition, based on field observations. \n\nAccording with Mendes and Oliveira (2004), higher concentration of TP are usually \n\nfound in surface water of sedimentary areas, usually at lower altitude (Mendes and \n\nOliveira, 2004).  \n\nWithin urban land-use, green areas, such as lawns and gardens, have been also recognised \n\nas an important source of nutrients, resulting from fertilization practices (Law et al., 2004; \n\nCarey et al., 2013). In Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, the higher NO2+NO3 concentrations were \n\ngenerally observed after the summer (23/10/2011 and 25/09/2012), possibly associated \n\nwith lawns and gardens fertilization, mostly performed in spring and late summer. \n\nHowever, limited overland flow is usually generated in these pervious surfaces, leading \n\nto minor nutrient loads. The highest median NO2+NO3 concentrations in Esp\u00edrito Santo \n\n(1.5 mg L-1) could be due to agricultural fertilizers. Although Esp\u00edrito Santo has a small \n\npercentage agricultural land-use (5%), some of the fields are adjacent to the stream \n\nchannel, and may establish a direct contribution of nutrients, particularly nitrate, into the \n\nsurface water. However, both in agricultural fields and green surfaces of urban areas, \n\nimpacts on surface water quality will depend on fertilizer management practices, such its \n\ntiming, recycling grass clippings without adjusting fertilizer rates, irrigation practices, \n\nspecies variability and soil characteristics (e.g. Carey et al., 2013; Wilbers et al., 2014). \n\nFurthermore, specific loads of NO2+NO3 increased with % urban area (Figure 6.20), \n\nwhich may result from atmospheric deposition, given the greater values recorded after \n\nthe summer.  \n\nIn Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, NO3 did not represent a constraints for irrigation use, since the \n\nrecommended guidelines were not exceeded (Environmental Ministry, 1998). Similarly, \n\nTP at all the study sites fulfilled the standards for minimum surface water quality. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6 \u2013 ASSESSING SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF STREAMWATER \n\nCHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION \n\nTO RAINFALL EVENTS \n\n \n\n218 \n\nPhosphorus seems to be the limiting nutrient of aquatic ecosystems in the study \n\ncatchment. Higher nutrient loads in surface water usually trigger eutrophication problems.   \n\nStreamwater from woodland is usually associated with lower runoff and pollutant loads \n\n(Yu et al., 2014), which can explain the negative correlation between % of this land-use \n\nand median concentrations of EC and NO2+NO3. Furthermore, the negative correlation \n\nbetween % woodland and major cations concentrations (Na, Mg, Ca and K) may be due \n\nto greater infiltration and weathering (Table 6.5).  \n\n \n\nImpervious surfaces and other potential sources of metals \n\nAutomobile-related sources (e.g. fluids from parking lots, service stations, automobile \n\nexhaust, etc.) are important pollutant sources to runoff (Bannerman et al., 1993). Road \n\nrunoff has been considered an important pollutant source within urban areas, partially due \n\nto greater runoff volumes, compared with other land-uses, and thus, increased pollutant \n\nloads (Ellis et al., 1986; Bannerman et al., 1993; Crabtree et al., 2006). Typical pollutants \n\nin highway runoff include TS, metals (As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Fe, Pb Hg, Ni and Zn), nutrients \n\n(NH4, NO3, Nk and TP), organic compounds (ex., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, oil \n\nand grease), oxygen demand (COD and BOD) and conventional parameters, such as pH, \n\nturbidity and conductivity hardness (Herrera, 2007). Road runoff therefore may also have \n\ncontributed to greater COD and nutrient specif loads in Esp\u00edrito Santo (68 kg COD km-2, \n\n4 kg Nk km-2, 1 kg NH4 km\n-2 and 6 kg NO2+NO3 km\n\n-2). Also the significant positive \n\ncorrelations between % impervious surfaces and SELs of Mg, Na and NO2+NO3 in \n\nRibeira dos Cov\u00f5es may be linked to cement composition, which is largely represented \n\nby calcium oxide and silicon dioxide, with minor composition of aluminium and \n\nmagnesium oxides, and several alkalis, such as sodium oxide and potassium oxide \n\n(Hellebois et al., 2013).   \n\nVehicular traffic is an important factor affecting pollutant loads, particularly heavy metals \n\n(Zhao et al., 2010; Soares, 2014; Yu et al., 2014). Most pollutants associated with vehicles \n\noriginate from engine parts (Cu, Cr, Mn), lubricants (Zn and Ni), rusting (Fe), tire wear \n\n(Zn, Pb) and tire breaks (Cd) (Herrera, 2007). In the characterization of runoff highway \n\nperformed by Ellis et al. (1986), decrease metal loadings were observed in the order Fe > \n\nMn > Pb > Zn > Cu > Cd which reflects the expected availability of these metals.  \n\nIn Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es metal concentrations were not present at pollutant levels, but Zn, \n\nCu and Cd occasionaly exceeded the minimum environmental guidelines, mostly at \n\nrecession limb of later winter storms. Harmful concentrations of Zn were attained in \n\nESAC, Porto Bordalo and Quinta, possibly due to contributions from road traffic \n\nseparators, particularly placed nearby Porto Bordalo stream and downslope ESAC, \n\ncovering a greater road extension than within the other sites. Possible Zn contaminations \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n219 \n\ncould also result from industrial activities, namely wood conservation in sawmill \n\ncompanies and pharmaceutic industry, found in the study catchment. Industrial activities \n\nhave been also considered has a source of metals by previous authors (e.g. Naeemullah et \n\nal., 2014). \n\nCupper concentration guidelines were exceeded in few samples of all the sites, whereas \n\nCd was only measured in ESAC. Cupper exceeded the MRV guideline for irrigation \n\npurpose in Esp\u00edrito Santo, whereas VRM of Mn were exceeded in few water samples of \n\nESAC and Porto Bordalo. High concentrations of heavy metals in surface water may \n\nprovide toxic effects when used for animals and cultures irrigation (Environment \n\nMinistry, 1986). Generally, there is not an apparent relation between heavy metals \n\nconcentration and the urban extent, but the relatively high detection limit of the analytical \n\nmethods used may be masking the metal loads and the urban impact of surface water \n\nquality.  \n\nAccording with other authors (Yuan et al., 2013; Wilbers et al., 2014), the presence of \n\nheavy metals in urban environments were also associated with urban and industrial \n\nwastewater, particularly as a results of metal pipes corrosion. However, Sansalone et al. \n\n(2005) found that loadings of Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd were higher in urban stormwater than in \n\nuntreated municipal wastewater in a city with a population of 800000. Cupper, Zn and \n\nCd have been associated with farm lands as a result of animal manure and sewage sludge \n\napplications (Antonious et al., 2008). Few heavy metals such as Cu and Zn for instance, \n\nare also used as components of insecticides and fungicides (Mendes and Oliveira, 2004; \n\nYu et al., 2014), leading to potential sources of surface water contamination, not only \n\nfrom agricultural fields, but also from the urban areas, due to lawns and gardens \n\nmaintenance. Vander Laan et al. (2013) identified agriculture and urbanization as most \n\nlikely sources of metal contaminations, and that they are one of the stressors of aquatic \n\necosystems degradation. Metals may be also provided by natural sources, since metallic \n\nagents that are made available and mobile via reduced conditions (Mendes and Oliveira, \n\n2014; Wilbers et al., 2014). Iron and Mn are present naturally in soil-derived sediments \n\n(Ellis et al., 1986).  \n\n \n\nBare soil \n\nDespite the catchment outlet (ESAC) displayed the highest TS concentrations (median \n\nvalues of 298 mg L-1), Quinta drainage area demonstrated slightly higher specific TS \n\nloads than Esp\u00edrito Santo and ESAC (965 kg km-2, 937 kg km-2 and 804 kg km-2, \n\nrespectively). The higher TS load and turbidity values in Quinta are mostly because of \n\nthe enterprise construction site, which covers 10% of the drainage area, and encompasses \n\na major area of bare soil, resulting from deforestation and initial construction phase. \n\nRunoff erosion within the construction site was active during field visits, with widespread \n\nrills and visible accumulation of sediments in the retention basin which received the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6 \u2013 ASSESSING SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF STREAMWATER \n\nCHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION \n\nTO RAINFALL EVENTS \n\n \n\n220 \n\noverland flow from this area (Figure 6.21). Nevertheless, within Quinta drainage area, \n\nthere were additional bare soil sites associated with clear-felled woodland in upslope \n\nareas, which displayed signs of erosion. However, these sites do not seem to have a \n\nconsiderable impact on surface water TS or turbudity, since the overland flow from these \n\nareas tended to dissipate in downslope woodland areas, before reaching the stream \n\nnetwork. On the other hand, overland flow from the enterprise park is routed to the \n\nretention basin, which then discharges to the stream channel, providing fewer \n\nopportunities for sediments to settle down, and thus, represents a major contribution to \n\nthe Quinta TS load. \n\n \n\n             a)                                                       b)  \n\n   \n\nFigure 6.21 \u2013 (a) Rill erosion in the enterprise construction site  and (b) sediment accumulation \n\nwithin the retention basin. \n\n \n\nIn contrast, woodland clear-felled seemed to enhance TS loads in Esp\u00edrito Santo, \n\nparticularly in the last event (Table 6.6). Also afforestation of fields nearby the stream \n\nchannel led to substantial runoff erosion confirmed by field observations. Since the \n\noverland flow from these areas was generated near the stream channel, it could represent \n\nan important sediment load contribution, in contrast to upslope Quinta clear-felled areas. \n\nThe impact of soil disturbance close to the stream network was also noted in Porto \n\nBordalo during the 14/11/2011 rainfall event. At this time, there were roadworks (open \n\nditch) a few metres above the sampling site, and despite the smaller area affected, its \n\nimpact on surface water TS was very obvious and led to high TS concentrations, \n\nparticularly at the beginning of rainfall event. This explains the higher median TS \n\nconcentrations, as well as greater heterogeneity in the sampling records (Figure 6.6).  \n\nWithin urban land-uses, despite semi-pervious surfaces, such as unpaved parking sites, \n\ndid not correlate with TS, other authors refer to them as potential sources of sediments \n\ndue to great overland flow generation, since they behave like impermeable surfaces \n\n(Carey et al., 2013). Opposing, pervious surfaces within urban land-use over the \n\ncatchment, associated with minor or even absent overland flow, showed significant \n\nnegative correlations with TS concentrations, as well as turbidity (Table 6.5).       \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n221 \n\nIn Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, TS can influence surface water quality, since it includes suspended \n\nsediment (SS) fraction, which can play an important role on environmental impacts due \n\nto its high adsorptive capacity and mobilization of pollutants, such as nutrients, \n\nparticularly phosphorus (Atasoy et al, 2006; Carey et al., 2013) and heavy metals (Yu et \n\nal., 2014). Research has shown that due to their physical-chemical characteristics, the \n\nfiner particulates are more efficient in the adsorption of pollutants and hence will carry a \n\nrelatively higher pollutant concentration (Andral, 1999). Although much pollution is \n\nmoving in dissolved form, increasing SS concentrations may lead to increasing pollutant \n\nloads (Goonetilleke et al., 2005). Furthermore, the presence of sediments in surface water \n\nincreases turbidity and reduces the amount of light penetration, retarding photosynthesis \n\nand, as a consequence, decreasing the food supply available to aquatic life (Mendes and \n\nOliveira, 2004).  \n\nThe relationship between TS and SS in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es streamwater was measured in \n\na previous project, based on samples collected over two years (under baseflow conditions) \n\nin five sampling locations (Ferreira, 2009). Median values of SS/TS were 0.7 for Quinta \n\nstreamwater and 0.1 in the other streams. Assuming this relationship was kept constant \n\nover the time, despite the urbanization and during storm events, median SS concentrations \n\nover the ten storm events monitored increased form Porto Bordalo to Esp\u00edrito Santo, \n\nESAC and Quinta: 14 mg L-1, 25 mg L-1, 30 mg L-1 and 180 mg L-1. In addition, maximum \n\nSS per storm event would range from 16-115 mg L-1 in Porto Bordalo, 25-85 mg L-1 in \n\nEsp\u00edrito Santo, 29-166 mg L-1 in ESAC and 151-1680 mg L-1 in Quinta. These high \n\nconcentrations within Quinta demonstrate the impact of construction site on surface water \n\nquality.  \n\nDespite Portuguese legislation do not establish an environmental standard for suspended \n\nsediments, it considers a MRV of 60 mg L-1 for irrigation uses. Based on the SS \n\nestimations presented on previous paragraph, this guideline is largely exceeded in Quinta, \n\nas well as in the other study sites in few samples collected during greater storm events, as \n\ndenoted by the significant positive correlation between turbidity and streamflow at the \n\nsampling time. High concentrations of SS in irrigation waters may lead to clogging of soil \n\nand siltation of irrigation networks, particularly blockage of irrigation drop by drop and \n\nsprinkler systems (Environment Ministry, 1998).  \n\n \n\n6.5.1.2. Differences with lithology  \n\nSome differences in surface water properties between study sites can be linked to \n\nlithology. Major cations vary with bedrock material and soil. Generally, Ca is more \n\nabundant in limestone than sandstone (380 g kg-1 vs 13 g kg-1), whereas the other major \n\ncations tend to be more profuse in sandstone than limestone (Mg: 7 g kg-1 vs 4 g kg-1, Na: \n\n17 g kg-1 vs 6 g kg-1, K: 11 g kg-1 vs 3 g kg-1) (Reimann and Caritat, 1998). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6 \u2013 ASSESSING SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF STREAMWATER \n\nCHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION \n\nTO RAINFALL EVENTS \n\n \n\n222 \n\nThe Porto Bordalo sub-catchment, underlain by limestone, displayed low specific loads \n\nof Na and K (16 kg km-2 and 10 kg km-2), but high Ca and Mg loads (65 kg km-2 and 18 \n\nkg km-2), despite not always distinctively different from sandstone-dominated Esp\u00edrito \n\nSanto and Quinta sub-catchments, possibly due to different hydrological regimes. \n\nNevertheless, a characterization study performed within Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, identified \n\nCa and Mg concentrations at the soil surface (0-20 cm) over 13- and 2- times higher in \n\nlimestone than sandstone (Pato, 2007). There was also a significant positive correlation \n\nbetween specific Mg loads and impervious surface within urban land-use, which can be \n\nlinked with Porto Bordalo results. As mentioned before, although this catchment does \n\nnot have the largest impervious cover, surface runoff reaching the stream channel is \n\nlargely provided by the urban drainage system, which collects and pipes overland flow \n\nfrom urban areas (mostly roads but also roof runoff routed to the roads) close to the \n\nsampling site.  \n\nPorto Bordalo displayed higher pH than in sandstone surface water. Previous studies in \n\nRibeira dos Cov\u00f5es, also reported limestone soils exhibiting greater pH (~7.6) than \n\nsandstone (4.5-5.2) soils (Pato, 2007). Porto Bordalo surface water showed significant \n\nhigher pH than ESAC, which is only partially overlying limestone (41%). This is possible \n\ndue to the lower streamflow contribution from Porto Bordalo to the catchment outlet \n\n(23%) (Chapter 5). Nevertheless, surface water pH within Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es was largely \n\nwithin neutral classification, and did not menace the environmental quality standards for \n\nsurface water. However, the higher values measured in Porto Bordalo (during the \n\nrecession limb of the small storm event of 26/10/2011 and the initial samples of \n\n02/11/2011), surpassed the recommended guidelines for irrigation uses. These slightly \n\nalkaline properties could have been associated with greatest Fe concentrations, indicative \n\nof older water mobilization, which had greater contact time with soil and that was not \n\nmobilized during storm events observed immediately after the long summer. However, \n\nFe abundance in limestone is typically lower than sandstone soils (5 g kg-1 vs 10 g kg-1) \n\n(Reimann and Caritat, 1998).  \n\nOccasionally, Zn attained pollutant concentrations (slightly higher than 0.5 mg L-1, \n\nMinistry of Environment, 1998) in Porto Bordalo and ESAC, fully or partially overlaying \n\nlimestone, and in Quinta construction site. These highest concentrations of Zn were \n\nmeasured mainly under the falling limb of hydrograph (not shown), mostly in storm \n\nevents after the summer, in the limestone dominated areas (25/09/2013). This high Zn \n\nconcentrations could result from soil water accumulated during the summer which was \n\neasily mobilized with the first rainfall events after the dry period, since the presence of \n\nZn in surface water may result from soil and rock leachate. Sandstone bedrock is usually \n\nassociated with lower Zn proportions than limestone (20 mg kg-1 vs 40 mg kg-1). \n\nHowever, in Quinta, pollutant concentration levels were observed in late winter \n\n(15/01/2013) and could result from materials being used under the constructions site.  \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n223 \n\nManganese concentrations were always very low within Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es (<0.1 mg L-\n\n1), but showed slightly higher values in Porto Bordalo, followed by ESAC (maximum \n\nvalues of 0.4 mg L-1 and 0.2 mg L-1), which may indicate possible leachate from limestone \n\nareas. Limestone areas usually display higher Mn in its composition than sandstone \n\n(700 mg kg-1 vs 100 mg kg-1) (Reimann and Caritat, 1998). Nevertheless, these \n\ndifferences between sandstone and limestone could be rather a result of anthropogenic \n\nsources, namely road runoff, as mentioned in section 6.5.1.1. \n\nTotal solids concentration significantly increased in sandstone but decreased in limestone \n\nareas. This is related to soil aggregation properties, which are lower under sandstone, and \n\nthus easily eroded, despite the higher infiltration capacity than in limestone. Stronger \n\ncohesion between limestone soil particles enhances the resistance to soil erosion.  \n\n \n\n6.5.2. Temporal variation of surface water quality \n\nSurface water quality ranged over the study period, demonstrating opposing seasonal \n\ntrends between some physical-chemical parameters (apart from Ca and Mg which did not \n\nreveal significant temporal differences between samplings). Many research studies have \n\nreported the influence of climate and hydrological variation, particularly of rainfall and \n\nflow discharge, on water quality (Meixner and Fenn, 2004; Brilly et al., 2006; Wilbers et \n\nal., 2014). \n\nRainfall events monitored after the summer (23/10/2011 and 25/09/2012), recorded \n\ngreater concentrations of COD, nutrients (Nk, NH4, NO2+NO3 and TP) and Mn, with \n\ngeneral decreasing tendencies through the wet season. Some Nk and NH4 concentrations \n\nfound during these rainfall events surpassed the minimum surface water quality standards. \n\nFirst rainfall events sampled after the summer also leaded to great TS concentrations, or \n\nat least higher standard deviations. The impact on TS concentrations was particularly \n\nnoticed in Quinta and Esp\u00edrito Santo, especially in 25/09/2012 since it represents the \n\nbeginning of streamflow (first runoff) after the dry season.  \n\nGenerally, nutrients in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es (phosphorous and nitrogen forms) reached \n\nhigh concentrations during winter storm flows, near the peak discharge. In a vegetated \n\ncatchment in southern England, May et al. (2001) reported greater phosphorus uptake \n\nduring the growing season of plants (from spring to early autumn), leading to greater \n\nnutrient loads in the river system during the winter. In addition, authors also reported the \n\ngreater phosphorus uptake by macrophytes and algae at low flow than higher winter flow. \n\nNevertheless, in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es study green areas may not be the main TP source \n\nwithin the study catchment.  \n\nIn a mainly agricultural region of Vietnam, highest concentrations of NO3 and NH4 were \n\nobserved during the dry season, but in different regions of the country highest \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6 \u2013 ASSESSING SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF STREAMWATER \n\nCHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION \n\nTO RAINFALL EVENTS \n\n \n\n224 \n\nconcentrations of NO3 were found during the wet season, but no temporal variation in \n\nNH4 concentrations were reported (Wilbers et al., 2014). These findings suggest that \n\nnutrient concentrations vary with location and over the time. In a set of catchments located \n\nin the San Bernardino Mountains, California, Meixner and Fenn (2004) found a positive \n\nrelationship between nitrate and discharge, suggesting that nitrate may accumulate in the \n\nsoil zone during dry periods. In an urban fringe catchment of Los Angeles, Barco et al. \n\n(2008) also exhibited highest NO3 during the first runoff event after an extended dry \n\nperiod (flushing effect), and lower concentration in the spring. This hydrological \n\nenhanced behaviour was explained by NO3 accumulation during dry periods in soils and \n\ngroundwater from mineralization and nitrification processes, as well as high atmospheric \n\ndeposition. Ocampo et al. (2006) also found that the antecedent moisture conditions of \n\nthe catchment at seasonal and interannual times-scales had a major impact on the nitrate \n\nflushing response. \n\nAtmospheric deposition may contribute with several pollutants, as a result of human \n\nactivities emission, particularly industrial and vehicular traffic, but also natural sources, \n\nsuch as pollens. Fossil fuel combustion produces nitrogen oxides (NOx) which are \n\nconverted to nitric acid and nitrate aerosols. Catalytic converters in vehicles also release \n\ngases enriched with nitrogen, which may deposit along major roads (Carey et al., 2013). \n\nStolzenbach et al. (2001), using a regional air quality model, estimated that dry \n\natmospheric deposition in Los Angeles region can contribute as much as 13\u201399% of the \n\ntotal mass loading of metals to Santa Monica Bay. In China, local air pollution with metal-\n\nenriched dust was considered an important source of Cu and Zn concentrations, leading \n\nto exceeding surface water quality standards (Yu et al., 2014). \n\nIn Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, pollutant accumulation during dry periods and subsequent wash-\n\noff process during the first rainfall events, may explain in part the higher concentrations \n\nof COD, nutrients and Mn. However, except with EC and Na, the negative or absent \n\ncorrelations between EMC parameters and API (7 and/or 14 days before the rainfall \n\nevent), did not seem to support the pollutant accumulation theory. Higher concentration \n\nafter the summer can, thus, be a consequence of the lower dilution effect resulting from \n\nlower streamflow. The small dilution effect was also considered by Wilbers et al. (2014), \n\nto explain the higher COD and Mn concentrations during dry season. Whitehead et al. \n\n(2009) stressed the relationship between decreased flow velocities and less mixing of \n\nwater with higher concentrations of organic pollutants. \n\nIn the study catchment, higher SELs resulted from major rainfall events observed during \n\nwet season. Thus, SELs were significantly positively correlated with rainfall amount, \n\nrainfall duration and streamflow (Table 6.5). It has been argued elsewhere that the strong \n\ncorrelation of wash-off loadings with total runoff and event duration determines the flow \n\nvolume required to overcome surface roughness and retention thresholds on the surface, \n\nleading to runoff and pollutants transfer downslope (Ellis et al., 1986). Wilbers et al \n\n(2014) also reported the impact of increasing rainfall events on run-off from urban and \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n225 \n\nagricultural lands to enhance water pollutants contamination. Yu et al. (2014) reported \n\npositive correlations between rainfall amount and loadings of Zn, Pb, Cd and Cr in a \n\nrapidly developing mixed land-use catchment of China. \n\nPeak discharge and SELs of all the quantifiable parameters analysed, except NO2+NO3, \n\nCOD, Na, Mg and Fe, are positively correlated. An investigation into the quality of \n\nsurface water from a motorway catchment stressed that it is peak flow intensity rather \n\nthan volume which is of significance in runoff terms (Pope et al., 1978). Athayde et al. \n\n(1982) have suggested that runoff volume is the most significant predictive loading factor \n\nwith preceding dry period and peak rainfall intensity as the most important regulators of \n\npollutant concentrations.  \n\nRainfall intensity was also an important parameter influencing temporal variation of \n\nsurface water quality. Maximum rainfall intensity in 15- and 60-minutes displayed \n\nsignificant positive correlations with specific loads of all the quantifiable parameters, \n\nexcept NO2+NO3 and Na. Previous authors also showed pollutant removal and loss \n\nthrough overland flow to be dependent on rainfall intensity, due to increased erosivity of \n\nrain splash and greater depth of interaction between rainfall and soil (Thompson et al., \n\n2012). The impact of rainfall intensity was particularly noticed in the greatest TS \n\nconcentrations measured at the four sites in 02/11/2010 (I15= 15.9 mm), but also in \n\n14/11/2011 (I15= 2.7 mm, observed after largest antecedent rainfall period, demonstrated \n\nby API14= 98.5 mm). Impacts of rainfall intensity were particularly important for bare \n\nsoil. Due to enterprise park construction, Quinta showed the highest TS concentrations \n\nand turbidity, greater than in ESAC surface water, which represents the catchment outlet. \n\nThe increasing flow from other cleaner tributaries and baseflow dilutes the Quinta flow, \n\nminimizing the potential impact of upslope pollutant sources particularly on turbidity.  \n\nThrough the wet season, increasing baseflow contribution as well as inputs of water \n\nretained in the soil during previous rainfall events may also have a positive impact of few \n\nchemical parameters. The longer contact between water and soil matrix may provide \n\nhigher loads of soil leachate elements into the stream network. This could explain the \n\nhigh Nk concentrations exhibited in some surface water samples collected in late winter, \n\nthe higher Na and K concentrations through the wet season, as well as the significant \n\npositive correlations observed between baseflow and major cations concentration in \n\nsurface water (Na, Mg and Ca).  \n\nSince groundwater is usually associated with lower organic contamination (Carey et al., \n\n2013), except when septic tanks are present (which is not the case in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es), \n\nbaseflow increases could have led to significant COD decreases (significant correlation \n\nfound between the variables), associated with a possible dilution effect on streamflow in \n\nstorm episodes.  \n\nHigher heavy metal concentrations were also observed during wet settings (associated \n\nwith stormflow), particularly Zn, Cu and Cd, which occasionally surpassed \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6 \u2013 ASSESSING SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF STREAMWATER \n\nCHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION \n\nTO RAINFALL EVENTS \n\n \n\n226 \n\nenvironmental and/or irrigation uses guidelines. These higher concentrations may be due \n\nto possible sewer contaminations, as discusses in section 6.5.1.. Iron and Zn \n\nconcentrations exhibited a particular temporal variation over the study period. Iron \n\ndisplayed greater concentration during the first half sampling campaigns and greater \n\ndilution in later storm events, whereas Zn showed an opposite trend. This temporal \n\nvariability of Fe and Zn could have been affected by human sources. However, since there \n\nwere not an apparent change on car/local industry/sewage sources in the Ribeira dos \n\nCov\u00f5es, a possible explanation may be linked with atmospheric contributions from a \n\nmetallurgical industry, located 3 km from the north boundary of the catchment, and \n\npotential changes in the production chain. In fact, some of the Zn concentrations \n\nexceedance as regards to minimum surface water quality standards were observed in late \n\nsummer (25/09/2012), after a longer potential period of accumulation. Nevertheless, \n\nfurther investigation is required to understand the temporal pattern of Fe and Zn within \n\nRibeira dos Cov\u00f5es. \n\n \n\n6.5.3. Water quality at the catchment scale \n\nSurface water quality within Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es revealed spatial variation, resulting from \n\nland-use and land-cover, as observed in other research studies (Basnyat et al., 1999; \n\nCarrey et al., 2011). Urban land-use, and particularly impervious surfaces, represented an \n\nimportant source of pollutants (Figure 6.19). The relation between major cations and TIA \n\ncan be a result of cement composition, mainly under oxide forms of the cations (e.g. CaO, \n\nMgO, Na2O and K2O) (Hellebois et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2013). Despite the increase of \n\nEC, COD, NO2+NO3 and major cations with imperviousness, these parameters do not \n\nseem to represent a direct threat for aquatic ecosystems, since they are not regulated by \n\nthe Portuguese environmental standards for surface water quality (Environmental \n\nMinistry, 1998). Thus, the results of the study do not allow to identify a threshold of \n\nimpervious cover leading to aquatic ecosystems degradation. Nevertheless, there is no \n\ndoubt that increasing organic matter (included on COD) and nitrogen loads, namely under \n\nNO2+NO3 forms, may cause surface water degradation, including eutrophication, \n\ndepending on phosphorous availability. \n\nTotal impervious area have been considered by other authors as an indicator of aquatic \n\necosystems conservation status (e.g. Arnold and Gibbons, 1996; Morse et al., 2003; \n\nKuusisto-Hjort and Hjort, 2013). In previous research studies, several TIA values were \n\nrecognised to degrade specific water quality parameters. TIA thresholds include 30-50% \n\nfor several chemical measures and 5-50% for physical variables (Brabec et al., 2002). \n\nMore specifically, TIA includes 42% for nutrients degradation (Griffin et al., 1980) and \n\n45% for phosphorus (May et al., 1997). Considering metal degradation, 50% of TIA was \n\nidentified, as well as 40% in the case of Zn (Horner et al., 1997). Although this TIA limits \n\nare specific for individual parameters, aquatic ecosystems behave as a whole and one \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n227 \n\nparameter may trigger impacts which affect all the system. TIA thresholds for general \n\nwater quality include different ranges recognized by distinct authors. For example, Schiff \n\nand Benoit (2007) reported that 5-10% TIA may weaken water quality, whereas Exum et \n\nal. (2005) recognised modest impacts for this TIA percentage. Other authors assumed a \n\nminimum of 10% TIA threshold for minimum degradation start (Schueler, 1994; Arnold \n\nand Gibbons, 1996; Exum et al., 2005), 20% TIA for successful remediation efforts \n\n(Exum et al., 2005) and a maximum of 30% threshold for unavoidable impacts (Arnold \n\nand Gibbons, 1996). Differences in TIA thresholds between authors may stress the \n\nimportance of pollutant sources.  \n\nIn Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, several water quality parameters did not show a relationship \n\nbetween mean event loads and TIA, including turbidity, TS, COD, Nk, NH4, Zn, TP, Fe \n\nand Zn. Major sources of these pollutants may include bare surfaces as regards to TS \n\nloads, sewage contaminations (COD, TP, NH4, Fe and Zn), manure (NH4), industrial \n\npollution and lithology (Fe and Zn).  \n\nChemical loads were directly affected by hydrologic regime. Generally, streamflow \n\nincreases during the wet season, not only as a direct consequence of rainfall events, but \n\nalso antecedent rainfall and increasing baseflow, as a result of water table rise. Antecedent \n\nrainfall affects soil moisture content, which is an important parameter determining \n\ninfiltration and, thus, overland flow processes (Grayson et al., 1997; Hardie et al., 2011). \n\nThis leads to temporal variations in overland flow generation and transfer over the \n\nlandscape. Differences in hydrological connectivity will have impacts on stream \n\ndischarge, but also on water quality. Increasing flow connectivity within a catchment will \n\ninvolve a larger number of pollutant sources, enhancing the loads for the stream network. \n\nThis can explain the generally high concentrations of COD, nutrients, major cations and \n\nheavy metals in later winter storms. The location of pollutant sources within a catchment \n\nand the connectivity with stream network may be crucial for water quality impacts \n\n(Brabec et al. 2002; Groffman et al., 2004).     \n\nDespite the greatest absolute chemical loads were observed at the catchment outlet \n\n(ESAC), this drainage area exhibited the lowest specific loads of the four study \n\ncatchments. Lower cathments produce less loads per unit area than the monitored \n\nupstream tributary catchments. In extensive areas, higher infiltration opportunities may \n\ndecrease flow connectivity between the sources of pollutants and the stream network, \n\nwhich can explain lowest specific loads at the catchment outlet. Ellis et al. (1986) stated \n\nthat catchment loadings are controlled predominantly by transport limited hydrodynamic \n\nconditions rather than by source availability. According to Horner et al. (1997), runoff \n\ninfiltration or retention in surface depressions is the key to reduce pollutant loads reaching \n\nthe stream network.  \n\nThe relevance of connectivity between pollutant sources and the stream network was \n\nhighlighted with TS results. Solid contributions from clear-felled areas located upslope \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6 \u2013 ASSESSING SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF STREAMWATER \n\nCHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION \n\nTO RAINFALL EVENTS \n\n \n\n228 \n\nQuinta were negligible, because overland flow had to overpass woodland land-use before \n\nreach the channel. On the other hand, clear-felled areas in Esp\u00edrito Santo displayed a great \n\nimpact in TS due to its proximity to the stream. Furthermore, fertilization and manure in \n\nagricultural fields nearby the stream channels also exhibited greater nitrogen impacts on \n\nsurface water.  \n\nIn addition, natural overland flow connectivity can be changed over a catchment through \n\nhuman interventions. Particularly in the urban land-uses, drainage systems are \n\nconstructed in order to collect and pipe overland flow to downslope areas. In Ribeira dos \n\nCov\u00f5es, storm runoff is usually piped into the stream network or nearby soils, where \n\noverland flow dissipates. Piping overland flow from impervious surfaces directly to the \n\nstream channels enhances not only the streamflow response, but also pollutant loads. The \n\nimpact of induced drainage system connectivity on streamwater quality was more evident \n\nin Porto Bordalo, where partial urban runoff was discharged above the sampling site.  \n\nThe hydrological connectivity provided by the urban drainage system may be particularly \n\nimportant under drier conditions. Despite the lower pollutant loads, some of highest \n\nconcentrations where measured during the first rainfall events after the summer, leading \n\nto surpassed minimum water quality standards, particularly as regards to Nk and NH4. \n\nWater quality degradation during drier periods was enhanced by the lack of dilution \n\neffect, resulting from lower streamflow. In contrast, natural pathways for overland flow \n\nor its discharge in downslope permeable soils, such as woodland and agricultural fields, \n\nwould enhance the opportunity for overland flow infiltration and, thus, reducing pollutant \n\nloads. The placement of impervious surfaces and the location of urban systems discharge \n\ninfluence the possible absorption by pervious surfaces, and represent an important issue \n\nregarding stream quality (Horner et al., 1997; Barbec et al., 2002).   \n\nSeveral studies have investigated the role of green areas, such as woodland land-uses, \n\nriparian zones and turfgrass, to improve water quality in urban catchments (Wickham et \n\nal., 2002; Matteo et al., 2006). Vegetated areas are effective in overland flow infiltration \n\nand, particularly, at reducing nutrient exports because these areas function as active \n\nnutrient transformation zones or sinks (Basnyat et al., 1999; Groffman et al., 2009). \n\nMatteo et al. (2006) also indicated that the selection and placement of green areas cover \n\ncan influence sediment and pollutant loadings.  \n\nDeveloping strategies to reduce overall pollutant exports within a catchment require an \n\nassessment of relative contribution sources and pollutant transport mechanisms (Carey et \n\nal., 2013). In addition, flow connectivity across the landscape and its seasonal variability \n\nas well as its impact on surface water quality represents important information for \n\nlandscape planning. Stein and Ackerman (2007) also noted that management strategies to \n\nprotect water quality should consider the seasonal importance of dry weather runoff. \n\nPrevent water quality damage under catchment management planning stage will be more \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n229 \n\ncost effective than later implementation of structural measures, which should be specific \n\nfor target pollutants (Goonetilleke et al., 2005). \n\nConsidering the relatively low storm events monitored and the huge land-use \n\nheterogeneity across the Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment, pollutant sources were not clearly \n\nidentified. However, the results highlighted the potential environmental problems \n\nresultant from higher TS concentrations, particularly during the first rainfall events after \n\nthe summer. Construction sites represent major sediment sources, and in situ \n\nmeasurements, such as surface cover with geotextile of areas temporarily unmanaged, \n\nshould be implemented to minimize erosion. Fertilizer and manure application, \n\nparticularly in agricultural fields adjacent to the stream channel should be appropriately \n\nmanaged, particularly as regards to the time and amount of application, in order to avoid \n\npollutant levels of nitrogen, not only after the summer but also during winter storms. \n\nHigher concentrations of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and COD were also \n\nassociated with urban areas, possibly due to domestic wastewater leakages. Periodic \n\nmaintenance of sewer systems should be performed in order to avoid environmental \n\nproblems. Sources of heavy metals within the study sites were possibly associated with \n\nroad runoff, but further investigation should be performed in order to better understand if \n\nroad runoff should be routed to wastewater treatments systems or not.  \n\n \n\n6.6. Conclusion \n\nPeri-urban catchments display multiple pollutant sources and pathways which affect \n\nsurface water quality. Within these catchments, the complex land-use pattern and its \n\nspatial configuration present additional challenges to identify the specific sources of \n\npollutants, particularly in a catchment with high spatial complexity such as the Portuguese \n\nRibeira dos Cov\u00f5es.   \n\nThis study revealed significant spatio-temporal variation in surface water quality, which \n\nvary between different physical-chemical parameters. Climatic conditions, land-use and \n\nlithology are parameters affecting catchment surface water chemistry. Some of the \n\nphysical-chemical properties increase with greater urban land-use extent, particularly \n\nwith impervious surface cover. Significant correlations between median event \n\nconcentration and percentage impervious surface were found for EC and NO2+NO3 on \n\ndissolved phase of surface water. Over the study period, median EC increased from 182 \n\n\u00b5S cm-1 in Quinta (sub-catchment with lowest urban area, 25%), to 318 \u00b5S cm-1 in \n\nEsp\u00edrito Santo (with greatest urban cover, 50%), whereas median NO2+NO3 \n\nconcentrations increased from 0.35 mg L-1 to 1.46 mg L-1. Significant positive correlations \n\nbetween major cations and urban impervious surface were also found (median values of \n\n5.7-18.6 mg Na L-1, 3.1-6.1 mg K L-1, 19.8-34.4 mg Ca L-1 and 3.2-10.4 mg Mg L-1 in the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6 \u2013 ASSESSING SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF STREAMWATER \n\nCHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION \n\nTO RAINFALL EVENTS \n\n \n\n230 \n\nmonitored sites), but they could have been influenced by lithology differences between \n\nthe study sites. \n\nGreatest specific loads of chemical parameters were found in the highly urbanized \n\nEsp\u00edrito Santo sub-catchment (mean event values of 203 kg COD km-2, 4 kg Nk km-2 and \n\n0.2 kg TP km-2), but greater TS loads were maeasured in Quinta sub-catchment (mean \n\nevent values ranged between 27 and 3943 kg km-2 over the 10 rainfall events monitored), \n\nencompassing 10% of its area under construction.   \n\nHydrological connectivity seems to be an important key issue on surface water quality, \n\nsince it determines the linkage between pollutant sources and stream network. Larger \n\nareas provide more opportunities for overland flow infiltration and retention, enhancing \n\nflow and pollutants pathways disruption. This may in part explain the lower specific \n\npollutant loads observed at the catchment outlet. The relevance of landscape connectivity \n\nwas also denoted by TS loads, with clear-felled located upslope woodland areas exposing \n\nlower TS contribution to the stream channel, than disturbed surfaces located nearby the \n\nstream and with overland flow linkage. Similarly, agricultural fields adjacent to the \n\nstream network could have led to higher nitrogen contributions than agricultural areas \n\nlocated at larger distances from watercourses. Nevertheless, in urban areas, the \n\nhydrological and, thus, pollutant sources connectivity with watercourses do not depend \n\non location and distance, but rather on the urban drainage system itself. Surface water \n\nwith direct contribution from impervious surfaces, provided by urban drainage system \n\ndischarge, showed higher event median concentrations of EC, TP, Nk, NH4 and Zn. \n\nFurthermore, leakages from the domestic wastewater drainage system may provide an \n\nimportant source of organic matter and nutrient contamination.    \n\nAlthough surface water quality is strongly influenced by the hydrological regime, the \n\nconcentrations in surface water often show distinct temporal patterns. Chemical oxygen \n\ndemand, nutrients (Nk, NH4, NO2+NO3 and TP) and Mn, presented higher concentrations \n\nin the first rainfall events monitored after the summer, and generally decreasing \n\nconcentrations through the wet season. This is thought to be a consequence of reduced \n\ndilution at times of low streamflow. Under these conditions, some minimum surface water \n\nquality standards were exceeded, notably Nk and NH4 (> 2.0 mg L\n-1 and 1.0 mg L-1), in \n\nall the studied catchments and sub-catchments (except in Quinta, with ~70% woodland \n\narea, as regards to NH4). In addition, concentrations of these parameters, as well as some \n\nheavy metals (Zn, Cu and Cd) also exceeded the environmental standards during late \n\nwinter storm events (>0.1 mg L-1 of Cu and Cd, and&lt;0.5 mg L-1 of Zn), possibly due to \n\nincreasing connectivity between sources and the stream network. Surface water quality \n\nin Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, occasionally exceeded the recommended guidelines for irrigation \n\nuse as regards to TDS (>640 mg L-1), pH (slightly higher than 9.0 in Porto Bordalo), Cu \n\n(>0.2 mg L-1 in Esp\u00edrito Santo), Mn (>0.2 mg L-1 in Porto Bordalo and ESAC) and Cd \n\n(>0.01 mg L-1 in ESAC). Despite occasional exceedance of maximum recommended \n\nvalues, the guidelines for maximum admissible value were always accomplished. \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n231 \n\nNevertheless, additional sampling during dry periods should be performed in order to \n\nassess water quality within Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es better, since some pollutants may be \n\ndiluted during rainfall events.  \n\nFurther investigation is required to assess changes in spatial location of pollutant sources \n\nover the year better. In addition, other pollutants typically associated with human \n\nactivities and urban land-uses, such as suspended sediments, BOD, oils, hydrocarbons \n\nand biological contaminants (e.g. coliforms), should be studied in order to improve the \n\nunderstanding of urbanization impacts on stream water quality. \n\nThe identification of pollutant sources and knowledge about the seasonal variation is \n\nimportant in order to establish spatially-explicit water management strategies to monitor \n\nand improve the local water quality at different time intervals. Moreover, a better \n\nunderstanding of the potential sources and sinks of pollutants should guide the \n\nstakeholders to design sustainable peri-urban areas. A planned land-use pattern at the \n\ncatchment scale can minimize surface water quality problems and protect aquatic \n\necosystem services. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6 \u2013 ASSESSING SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF STREAMWATER \n\nCHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION \n\nTO RAINFALL EVENTS \n\n \n\n232 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n233 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nCHAPTER 7  \n\nFINAL DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS AND \n\nRECOMENDATIONS \n\n7.1.

Context \n\nLand-use changes, including those associated with urbanization, can have major impacts \n\non hydrological processes and streamwater quality. These modifications can be \n\nparticularly significant and complex in peri-urban areas, due to the complex mosaic of \n\nthe landscape. Understanding how different combinations and arrangements of land-uses \n\naffect overland flow generation and its speed and magnitude transfer via other parts of \n\nthe catchment to the stream network is a major research question in hydrology.  \n\nThis research has been the first study to assess the spatio-temporal variation of surface \n\nhydrological processes and their impact on stream water quality in a peri-urban catchment \n\nin a Portuguese setting. The study has used an integrated methodology based on field data \n\nacquisition at different scales: soil properties, runoff plots and catchment/sub-catchment \n\nscale, which is not usually considered in this type of studies. Real data acquisition is \n\nessential for understanding the system behaviour, and measurements at different scales \n\nprovide important information for a better understanding on interactions between factors \n\ninfluencing processes and their integration at the catchment scale. Without data gathering, \n\nthere is no basis for predictive modelling and risk management, as well as decision-\n\nmaking based on scientific knowledge to establish preventive actions in order to minimize \n\nthe flood hazard.   \n\nThe research allies itself with WFD objectives in that it highlights nature\u2019s capacity to \n\nabsorb or control overland flow and the relevance of spatial planning for flood prevention \n\nand aquatic ecosystems protection. It also stresses that preventing these problems at a \n\nplanning stage and at the catchment scale is the most cost-effective solution.    \n\n \n\n7.2. The role of soil properties in different land-uses on \n\npotential overland flow processes  \n\nLand-use changes in the Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment were found to have affected soil \n\nproperties greatly and via them to have influenced infiltration and overland flow \n\nprocesses. Woodland soils were found to have the highest organic matter content and the \n\nlowest bulk density, favoured by the great vegetation cover. However, the vegetation also \n\nreleases hydrophobic compounds which form an impermeable surface soil layer and leads \n\nto infiltration-excess overland flow. This is particularly important in dry conditions, due \n\nto the widespread and stronger hydrophobic properties, particularly under eucalypt and \n\npine stands, dominant on woodland-sandstone areas (median infiltration capacity: 0.3 mm \n\nh-1). During the wet season, the switching properties of the hydrophobic substances and/or \n\nits leachate to deeper soil layers, lead to hydrophilic soil conditions and higher soil matrix \n\ninfiltration capacity, which reached 8.3 mm h-1 at some sites.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7 \u2013 FINAL DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMENDATIONS \n\n \n\n236 \n\nIn contrast, urban soils were found to be characterized by lowest soil organic matter \n\ncontent and greatest bulk density, possibly resulting from human trampling and vehicular \n\ntraffic. The limited production of hydrophobic substances input, associated with only a \n\nminor and patchy vegetation cover, was found to lead to widespread hydrophilic \n\nconditions over the year. Nevertheless, the lower vegetation cover led to greater soil \n\nmoisture increase during rainfall events, as a result of minor rainfall interception, but also \n\nfavours enhanced soil drying between storms. During dry periods, matrix infiltration \n\ncapacity was high (median 2.7 mm h-1), whereas, in wet periods, increased soil moisture \n\ncontent reduced infiltration capacity (median  1.2 mm h-1), favouring the development of \n\nsaturation overland flow.  \n\nIn agricultural fields, distinct land management associated with pasture, olive tree \n\nplantations and small gardens, dominant over sandstone soils, resulted in lower organic \n\nmatter and higher bulk density than in the abandoned fields on limestone, with vegetation \n\nfollowing the natural succession. In agricultural fields, the higher vegetation cover under \n\nlimestone than sandstone also leads to greater soil hydrophobicity. Nevertheless, given \n\nthe lower vegetation cover in agricultural-limestone than woodland soils, hydrophobicity \n\nwas not so severe and widespread, breaking down more easily with rainfall events and \n\nrequiring longer dry conditions to be re-established. Lower vegetation cover than \n\nwoodland and higher surface roughness than urban soils may have led to greater soil \n\nmoisture content in agricultural areas, particularly the ones overlaying limestone, due to \n\nthe marly nature and hence higher silt-clay content. In agricultural sandstone areas soil \n\nmatrix infiltration capacity was higher in summer (except in agricultural-limestone soils), \n\ndecreasing with soil moisture increase through the wet seasons (median matrix infiltration \n\ncapacity: 1.9 mm h-1 and 0.9 mm h-1, respectively).  \n\nDistinct spatio-temporal variation of soil hydrological properties led to contrasting matrix \n\ninfiltration capacity and overland flow sources between landscape units. In general, \n\nwoodland and agricultural-limestone areas were more susceptible to overland flow during \n\ndry periods, due to soil hydrophobicity, whereas urban and agricultural-sandstone soils, \n\nwith higher matrix infiltration capacity, may provide potential overland flow sinks. In \n\ncontrast, during wet conditions, increasing soil moisture in urban and agricultural soils \n\nled to lower matrix infiltration capacity, while switching hydrophobic to hydrophilic \n\nconditions enhanced the infiltration capacity of woodland soils. The changing nature of \n\noverland flow sources and sinks of different land-uses would decrease flow connectivity \n\nover the hillslope, minimizing the impacts on the streamflow regime. This information \n\nshould be considered in spatial urban planning in peri-urban catchments, in order to \n\nreduce connectivity of overland flow and maintain a more natural streamflow regime.  \n\n \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n237 \n\n7.3. Impact of different woodland types on overland flow  \n\nForest is generally associated with highly permeable soils. This was in general confirmed \n\nfor the three woodland types of Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es by the low overland flow recorded \n\nover two years (<3%). Nevertheless, dense eucalypt plantations produced twice as much \n\noverland flow than sparse eucalypt stands and oak woodlands. \n\nSignificant differences in soil properties, particularly hydrophobicity and soil moisture, \n\nwere observed between woodland types. Despite being widespread in dry periods and \n\nalmost absent during wettest seasons, hydrophobicity was generally low in oak soils, \n\nmoderate in sparse eucalypt stands and severe/extreme in dense eucalypt plantations. \n\nUnder dense eucalypt plantations, hydrophobicity required longer rainfall events to break \n\ndown and was quickly re-established after just a few days without rainfall. Furthermore, \n\nhydrophobicity tended to increase with soil depth in eucalypt areas, but exhibited an \n\nopposite trend in oak woodland soils. Oak woodland soils revealed greater soil moisture \n\ncontent than eucalypt sites.  \n\nDifferences in soil properties led to spatio-temporal variation in overland flow, despite \n\nthe minor amounts produced. Infiltration-excess overland flow was the most important \n\nprocess within dense eucalypt plantations, as a result of the significantly greater soil \n\nhydrophobicity. Under driest conditions, when hydrophobicity was largest, overland flow \n\nattained 2.3% of the rainfall in dense eucalypt plantations, but it did not surpass 0.5% in \n\nsparse eucalypt stands and 0.4% in oak woodland. In dense eucalypt stands, overland flow \n\nincreased with enhanced rainfall amount and intensity. On the other hand, in oak \n\nwoodland, overland flow was mainly associated with saturation mechanisms, although it \n\ndid not exceed 2.2% of the rainfall. In wettest periods, overland flow in dense and sparse \n\neucalypt stands only attained 1.0% and 1.1% of storm rainfall. In oak stands, overland \n\nflow appeared to be linked to saturation of the shallow soil during the wettest periods. At \n\nthe sparse eucalypt and oak sites, overland flow increased significantly with soil moisture \n\ncontent, perhaps produced due to the lower subsoil permeability, linked to its higher clay \n\ncontent and bulk density. The relatively low percentages of overland flow measured, both \n\nin hydrophobic and saturated soil matrix conditions, indicates the importance of water \n\nbypass via preferential flow paths provided by cracks and root holes.        \n\nResults from runoff plots highlight the important role that woodland areas have on water \n\ninfiltration and retention during rainfall events, even considering the differences in \n\noverland flow mechanisms. The protection of this land-use within peri-urban catchments, \n\nincluding downslope of urban expansion, is of utmost importance to minimize the impacts \n\nof enhanced urban runoff. Nevertheless, oak woodland is more favourable to mitigate \n\nfloods than eucalypt plantations.    \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7 \u2013 FINAL DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMENDATIONS \n\n \n\n238 \n\n7.4. Catchment hydrology and water quality, and potential \n\nimpacts of the landscape pattern \n\nRibeira dos Cov\u00f5es has a relatively low annual runoff coefficient (14-22%) despite the \n\nhigh urbanization rate (40% in 2012). This is thought to be a consequence of the low \n\nstorage capacity of the catchment, linked to high potential evapotranspiration and high \n\npermeability linked to the limestone and sandstone lithology. The low annual BFI (37-\n\n39%) can also be explained by this high permeability of the generally deep soil, but may \n\nalso in part result from valley infill favouring subsurface flow beneath the river discharge \n\ngauging station.   \n\nThe seasonal Mediterranean climate is a major hydrological driver on streamflow and \n\npollutant loads. During the summer, discharge is limited and dominated by baseflow \n\n(63%). Infiltration-excess is the dominant overland flow process and is more prone in \n\nareas of degraded (highly compacted and without vegetation cover) and hydrophobic \n\nsoils, and on impervious urban surfaces. The low streamflow provides little dilution effect \n\nresulting in highest concentrations of chemical oxygen demand and nutrients (nitrogen \n\nand phosphorus). During the first rainfall events after the summer, nitrogen (kjeldahl \n\nnitrogen and ammonium) and manganese concentrations occasionally exceeded \n\nPortuguese surface water quality standards, but total solids also showed greatest \n\nconcentrations.   \n\nOver the wet season, increasing rainfall favours overland flow production, due to \n\nincreasing soil moisture, which led to greater streamflow and pollutant loads. Saturation \n\noverland flow was more prone in late winter, favoured by water table rise in valley \n\nbottoms and saturation of shallow soils on limestone hillslopes. Under saturated \n\nconditions, higher flow connectivity down hillslopes led to greater peak flows and also \n\nsome pollution problems, in the form of high kjeldahl nitrogen and ammonium, and some \n\nheavy metals (zinc, copper and cadmium), exceeding Portuguese environmental \n\nguidelines. \n\nHydrology and hydrochemistry varied with lithology. Sandstone plays an important role \n\non streamflow outlet delivery, with Ribeiro da P\u00f3voa (56% of the catchment area) \n\nsupplying 51% of ESAC discharge and 50% of storm flow (Figure 7.1). Within this \n\nlithology, stream network denotes a perennial flow regime, favoured by the greater \n\nbaseflow (annual BFI ranged between 25-33% at upstream gauging stations and 37-38% \n\nin downstream locations). In limestone areas, the ephemeral regime is the product of low \n\nbaseflow (~2% annual BFI), but annual storm flow represents 35% of ESAC storm flow. \n\nStreamwater chemistry within limestone areas showed higher pH as well as calcium, \n\nmagnesium and manganese concentrations, whereas sandstone exhibited higher sodium \n\nloads.  \n\nLand-use was also an important parameter influencing the catchment hydrological \n\nresponse. Across the catchment, increasing urban land-use was associated with greater \n\nrunoff and storm runoff coefficients, though these varied with lithology. Storm runoff \n\ncoefficients ranged from 3% in Cov\u00f5es to 21% in Esp\u00edrito Santo sub-catchments, with \n\nthe lowest and highest urban land-use (15%-17% and 47-49%) respectively (Figure 7.2).  \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n239 \n\nFigure 7.1 - Contributions from upslope sub-catchments to ESAC streamflow (bold percentage values) and storm flow between 2010/11 and \n\n2012/13 water years. \n\n                                                                              \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n. \n\n. \n\n. \n\n. \n. . \n\n. \n\n \n\n. \n\n. \n\n. \n\n. \n. . \n\n.  \n\n. \n\n. \n\n. \n\n. \n. . \n\n. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7 \u2013 FINAL DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMENDATIONS \n\n \n\n240 \n\nFigure 7.2 -   Storm runoff coefficients (bold values) of Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment and its sub-catchments between 2010/11 and 2012/13 \n\nwater years.

In the \n\nEsp\u00edrito Santo and Drabl sub-catchments of greatest urban cover (47% and 43%), winter \n\nstreamflow was only 2-4 times higher than in dry periods, whereas in less urbanized areas \n\nthe seasonal streamflow difference were greater, attaining as much as 21 times in Quinta \n\n(9-25% urban land-use). However, in terms of storm runoff coefficient, small differences \n\nwere found between dry and wet seasons in the downslope area of the catchment \n\n(downstream Ribeiro da P\u00f3voa and Drabl), covered by 51% of urban land-use, but also \n\nin Cov\u00f5es sub-catchment, where the reduced urban area (15%) is mostly located \n\ndownslope, with storm runoff being piped to the stream (Figure 7.2). These differences \n\nhighlight the role of impermeable surfaces on overland flow generation. During the rainy \n\nseasons, increasing soil moisture content led to enhanced flow connectivity over the \n\nlandscape, traduced on higher storm runoff coefficients during wet conditions (Figure \n\n7.2).   \n\nThe proximity of urban land-use to the stream network is an important parameter \n\ninfluencing streamflow. In most urban cores located upstream, overland flow is usually \n\nrouted and/or piped to downslope permeable soils, mostly into woodland areas but also \n\ninto agricultural fields. Overland flow discharge into areas of permeable soil facilitates \n\nwater infiltration and/or retention leading to minor contributions to the stream network. \n\nIn contrast, urban areas located near the stream network have a greater impact on \n\nstreamflow, particularly if storm runoff is piped directly to the water lines. During the \n\nstudy period, the 2% enlargement of the urban area of Cov\u00f5es, mostly downstream and \n\nwith overland flow piped directly into the stream, led to a 6% storm runoff coefficient \n\nincrease. On the other hand, the enlargement of urban area within Quinta (from 9 to 25%), \n\ndid not reflect on storm runoff increase, due to greater overland flow retention/infiltration \n\nopportunities in downslope permeable soils, enhanced by larger distance to the tributary. \n\nThe 7% growth in urban cover of Porto Bordalo, located in upslope areas far away from \n\nthe stream, also did not affect the runoff coefficient. This was also due to obstructions to \n\noverland flow in downslope areas by several structures, including road embankments, \n\nhouses, walls and surface depressions within construction sites.  \n\nUrban impervious surfaces also led to quicker response time. In Porto Bordalo and \n\nCov\u00f5es, where the urban overland flow is partially piped to the tributaries, peak flow was \n\nusually reached in 5-10 minutes after the peak rainfall. Despite the largest urban land-\n\nuses in Esp\u00edrito Santo and Drabl, response time was ~20 minutes. This was due to \n\noverland flow being routed into soils rather than being piped to the stream network. \n\nDespite the highest annual peak denoted an increasing tendency with urban areas \n\nexpansion, the analysis of storm events did not show a clear impact of urbanization on \n\npeak flow during the three years of study.  \n\nUrban land-use and impervious area also affected surface water quality. Increasing \n\nimperviousness led to greater specific loads of chemical oxygen demand, nitrogen \n\n(kjeldahl nitrogen) and phosphorus. Hydrological connectivity between sources of \n\npollutants and the stream network, however, is an important parameter affecting surface \n\nwater quality. Direct discharge of urban runoff into stream led to higher concentrations, \n\nparticularly of phosphorous and zinc. Erosion of bare soil by overland flow supplied \n\nconsiderable sediment when overland flow was connected to the water lines (e.g. the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7 \u2013 FINAL DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMENDATIONS \n\n \n\n242 \n\nenterprise park construction site). But when sediment sources were not hydraulically \n\nconnected with the stream network, particularly if they were located upslope of woodland, \n\nthe impact on surface water quality was minimal. Similarly, higher loads of nitrogen were \n\nmeasured in streams surrounded by agricultural fields. \n\nIn peri-urban catchments a dispersed settlement of urban structures, particularly located \n\nupslope, and the maintenance of permeable soils should be considered in order to \n\nminimize streamflow impacts, not only as regards to the magnitude of the flow but also \n\nto water quality. In Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es, the proximity of some houses to the stream \n\nnetwork and the expected future urbanization increase, controlling additional overland \n\nflow production and preventing it from reaching the stream network, would be very \n\nimportant to mitigate flood hazards and aquatic ecosystems degradation.  \n\n \n\n7.5. Overland flow processes at different scales and impacts \n\non catchment surface hydrology \n\nThe research in Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es indicates that different physical processes may \n\ndominate at different spatio-temporal scales. Based on soil properties, such as particle \n\nsize distribution, bulk density and hydrophobicity, spatial differences between land-uses, \n\nbut also within the same land-use, provide differences in soil matrix infiltration capacity \n\nwhich can support different overland flow processes. However, the relatively low soil \n\nmatrix infiltration capacity values measured at a very small soil scale with a minidisc \n\ninfitrometer did not corroborate with the high permeability indicated by the runoff plot \n\nexperiments and catchment hydrology. This could be because of the dominance of other \n\nphysical processes acting at larger scales.  \n\nPlot experiments highlighted the important role of preferential flow paths on hillslope, \n\nassociated with macropores such as cracks, root holes or wormholes, on infiltration of \n\nwater to deeper soil layers with a minimum contribution of the soil matrix. In addition, at \n\nthe hillslope scale, surface roughness can be an important parameter. Thus the greater \n\nsurface concavities and litter layer of woodland areas have a higher potential for overland \n\nflow retention. However, after the retention capacity is exceeded, flow connectivity will \n\nbe established downslope.   \n\nLand management in agricultural fields can also influence surface roughness, particularly \n\nthrough ploughing. Also ancestral stone walls, used in agricultural and woodland areas in \n\norder to promote water retention, are also effective in breaking flow connectivity. In urban \n\nareas, impervious surfaces not only promote greater overland flow and quicker transport \n\ndue to surface smoothness, though pervious soil areas can lead to overland flow \n\ninfiltration. Some urban features such as retention basins, embarkments and walls, may \nprovide surface water retention, although their role under large storm events may be limited \n\nand could exacerbate flood damages in case of failure.    \n\nAt the hillslope scale, soil depth and lithology could be also relevant parameters \n\ninfluencing hydrological processes. In shallow soils overlying marly limestone, soil \n\nsaturation and sub-surface lateral flow is prone to occur. Furthermore, lithology is also \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n243 \n\nassociated with baseflow delivery, representing a minor contribution in limestone areas, \n\nbut a considerable fraction of the sandstone streamflow.  \n\nApart from the spatial scales, hydrological processes are, to some extent, related with \n\ntime scales. Infiltration-excess, resulting from heavy rainfall events, is usually observed \n\nin short periods of time, varying between minutes to hours, according with rainfall \n\nduration. Saturation is typically slower, since overland flow is determined by building up \n\nsoil moisture. It can endure several days, particularly if saturated areas are influenced by \n\nwater table level. Subsurface lateral flow is often associated with response times of a day \n\nor longer (Bloschl and Sivapalan, 1995). Furthermore, baseflow at the catchment level, \n\ndue to delayed water sources and groundwater contribution, is usually linked to time-\n\nscales of months and years.  \n\nAll these spatio-temporal scales determine the catchment hydrology but also its \n\nhydrochemical properties. Overland flow sources and the mechanisms of transport over \n\nthe hillslope will influence the connectivity between pollutant sources and the stream \n\nnetwork. Nevertheless, greater distances create more opportunities for water infiltration \n\nand/or surface retention, if storm drainage systems are not installed.  \n\nIn general, considering the potential sources and sinks of overland flow and their \n\ncontribution to catchment hydrology, the landscape of Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es can be \n\ndivided into several hydrological units: 1) woodland-sandstone areas, characterized by \n\nhydrophobic soils and thus, susceptible to infiltration-excess overland flow in summer \n\nstorms and after dry periods; 2) woodland-limestone areas and agricultural \n\nfields overlying limestone, which are associated with high surface roughness but usually \n\nshallow soils, and hence more prone to saturation overland flow especially in wet periods; \n\n3) agricultural-sandstone areas and upslope urban areas (without overland flow being \n\npiped to the stream network), characterized by a low susceptibility to generate overland-\n\nflow; and 4) urban areas located near the stream network, characterized by high and \n\nrapid overland flow contribution to the streamflow, both from impervious surfaces \n\n(especially if directly piped to the ephemeral stream network)  and easily saturated urban \n\nsoils. \n\n \n\n7.6. Implications  \n\n7.6.1. Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment \n\nDespite the dominance of woodland areas, this peri-urban catchment has undergone rapid \n\nurbanization, which is expected to continue in the near future. The current mosaic of land-\n\nuses seems to favour water infiltration, traduced by the relatively low storm runoff \n\ncoefficients (Figure 7.2). Some of the urban areas are dispersed over the catchment and \n\nlocated in upslope positions, which not only represent safe areas in terms of flood hazard, \n\nbut also allow downslope areas to act as sinks for overland flow infiltration and/or \n\nretention. Nevertheless, there are urban cores placed on valley bottoms, and the proximity \n\nbetween some infrastructures, namely houses, to the stream network, highlight the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7 \u2013 FINAL DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMENDATIONS \n\n \n\n244 \n\nvulnerability to floods (Figure 7.3).  A few flood events have already brought \n\ninconvenience and damage to the local population. This problem is expected to become \n\nmore frequent, considering the upslope urban areas planned for the near future (Figure \n\n7.3).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.3  \u2013 Location of most vulnerable houses (based on reports of local citizens of previous \n\nflood events), projected urban cores and potential sites for installing retention basins (adapted \n\nfrom Google Earth, 2014).  \n\n \n\nThe projected urban cores and extent of the existing ones are well positioned within the \n\ncatchment, considering the topography, hydrology and accessibility. However, despite \n\nthe downslope opportunities for overland flow infiltration, increasing impervious area \n\nwould affect streamflow and enhance flood hazard in downslope urban areas. The most \n\nappropriate solution to protect the most vulnerable citizens would be to relocate them in \n\nother urban spaces, and convert these areas into additional stream bank. However, this \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nVulnerable urban cores  \n\nProjected urban areas \n\n \n\nCurrent retention basin  \n\nPotential sites for additional retention basins \n\nRibeira dos Cov\u00f5es \ncatchment \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n245 \n\nwould be a drastic measure which would bring conflicts with local population and high \n\nfinancial costs.  \n\nThe most cost-efficient solution to protect downslope urban areas from flood hazard, \n\nwould be to enhance overland flow infiltration and/or retention in upslope areas, and \n\nprevent additional run-off from the new urban cores. The establishment of green areas \n\nwithin the urban cores would not only have aesthetical value but also create permeable \n\nareas which could enhance water infiltration. Other potentially useful measures would be \n\nto construct infiltration trenches immediately downslope of urban structures and retention \n\nbasins in open fields. Suggested locations for these preventive structures are shown on \n\nFigure 7.1 and were selected based on the streamflow amount resulting from upslope \n\nurban cores but also in the overland flow from the highway. In addition to reducing the \n\nflow connectivity over the landscape, these structures would also delay the overland flow \n\nand retain sediments, which would be important to reduce suspended sediment loads in \n\nstream water. \n\nIn the enterprise park area under current construction, the overland flow is routed at the \n\nmoment to a retention basin, which delays the flow delivery into the stream network \n\n(Figure 7.1). However, discharge from the retention basin has already caused the stream \n\nto overflow onto downslope agricultural fields. This is mostly because of the small size \n\nof the channel section, thus its enlargement seems to be the only effective solution to \n\nreduce the flooding hazard, erosion and potential pollution of these fields with urban \n\npollutants, particularly nutrients and metals.  \n\nAn important problem observed within the study catchment is the lack of cleaning and \n\nmaintenance of features of the urban drainage network. Sediments tend to clog drains and \n\nchannels, thus reducing their drainage capacity and leading to overflow. These problems \n\ncan be easily solved with regular cleaning and dredging activities.  \n\nInspections and maintenance operations to the wastewater drainage system would be also \n\nimportant, in order to prevent sewage leakages and surface water contamination. \n\n \n\n7.6.2. Urban land management  \n\nLand-use changes, particularly of peri-urban areas, should be planned so as to minimize \n\nhydrological changes and flood hazard resulting from urban development. These goals \n\ncould be partially achieved through appropriate spatial planning at the catchment scale. \n\nPhysical catchment characteristics, such as geology, topography and soil properties, \n\nshould be considered in order to evaluate the potential uses. Importantly, however, a \n\nlandscape pattern comprising a strategically positioned combination of land-uses should \n\nbe designed to favour water infiltration and detention. As this study has demonstrated, \n\nduring the year, different land-uses are prone to provide potential sources and sinks of \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7 \u2013 FINAL DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMENDATIONS \n\n \n\n246 \n\noverland-flow. Thus a mosaic of mixed land-uses that will break flow connectivity across \n\nthe landscape can be designed so as to restrict the amount of overland flow reaching the \n\nstream network, leading to smaller changes in streamflow storm peaks, less water quality \n\ndegradation and hence only minor impacts on aquatic ecosystems.  \n\nIn Portugal, municipalities are the responsible authorities for land-use planning, through \n\nthe development of the Municipal Master Plan. These plans should try to incorporate \n\nland-use patches in any development proposal to reduce overland flow sources and \n\nprovide infiltration areas. Besides the spatial location and extent of each land-use, these \n\nmunicipal plans should also limit the maximum area of impervious surfaces. Adequate \n\nprovision of permeable surfaces breaking up the impervious area could greatly increase \n\ninfiltration and reduce peak flows at the stream network. \n\nThe safeguarding of soils with greatest infiltration capacity is recognised at a Portuguese \n\nnational level. A network of sites with ecological interest, in which maximum infiltration \n\nareas are included, has been established (National Ecological Reserve). All the areas \n\nincluded in this reserve have several usage restrictions, in order to preserve their \n\necological role (Ministry of Planning and Territory, 1990). These areas include stream \n\nbeds and areas threatened by floods (defined as areas covered by water during medium \n\nfloods). Moreover, with the purpose of minimizing flood damage, national legislation \n\nimposes tight construction restrictions within 10 m of non-navigable streams (Ministries \n\nof Marine and Public Constructions, 1971), though, this protection distance is not always \n\nadhered to.   \n\nAlthough improved landscape planning and protection of maximum infiltration areas are \n\ncost-efficient methods to reduce overland flow, additional measures can be required in \n\norder to maximize upstream overland flow reduction. It could be important to combine \n\nnonstructural (associated with planning process) and structural (e.g. stormwater detention \n\nstructures, such as dykes and dams) measures to mitigate flood risks. Sustainable urban \n\ndrainage systems, incorporating features such as infiltration trenches and small detention \n\nponds, have been considered as cost-effective means to control overland flow and \n\nassociated pollutant loads and partially restore a more natural hydrologic regime to a \n\ncatchment (Parikh et al., 2005).  \n\n \n\n7.7. Challenges and limitations of the research \n\nCatchment hydrology is a result of the complex interplay of several biophysical \n\nparameters, such as climate pattern, topography, geology and soil properties, land-use and \n\nland cover as well as their historical evolution. The requirement of knowledge in all these \n\nfields in a holistic approach to understanding hydrological and hydrochemical processes \n\nrepresented the most challenging issue in this research study. Despite this research \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n247 \n\ncontributed to a better understanding of the impact of a Portuguese peri-urban style, the \n\ninfluence of each landscape unit and the result of different combinations and \n\narrangements of land-uses on overland flow connectivity and streamflow discharge, \n\nparticularly, surface water chemistry remains not fully understood and some aspects \n\nrequire further investigation.  \n\nBesides the complexity to understand overland flow processes at different spatial and \n\ntime scales, and its influence on transfer mechanisms over the hillslope, additional \n\nchallenges were posed by the influence of urban drainage systems. They significantly \n\naffect the connectivity between overland flow and pollutant sources and the stream \n\nnetwork. Over the study period, there were contacts with the local authorities responsible \n\nfor the design, development and maintenance of the urban drainage system. However, \n\ndespite their interest in the outcomes of this research, the bureaucratic process for formal \n\nrequests for drainage system information, and its approval by the company managers, did \n\nnot allow the supply of this information in time. Because of this lack of information \n\ntransfer, the discussed impact of the drainage system was based on field observations and \n\ninformation from local citizens, rather than from arguably more accurate official sources. \n\nIt was not possible to calculate the directly connected impervious area and, thus, quantify \n\nthe connectivity over the catchment and adequately assess its impact on streamflow \n\nresponse.  \n\nLonger-term monitoring data would be also valuable for a better understanding of the \n\nspatio-temporal overland flow processes, since  the hydrological years covered in this \n\nstudy were years of below- or near-average annual rainfall. It is important to measure and \n\nunderstand how catchment hydrology change under rainiest conditions, and particularly \n\nduring severe rainfall events, since these will be the most endangering for local people, \n\nand the ones where the impacts most need to be minimized. \n\nLimited human resources also represented an important constraint to the study, given the \n\ntime required to install and maintain the extensive monitoring network involved. Time \n\nrequired for field measurements was not always compatible with the quick hydrological \n\nresponse of Ribeira dos Cov\u00f5es catchment, which led to a relatively low number of high \n\nflow measurements at all the gauging stations. It also affected the temporal resolution of \n\nsurface water sampling in storm hydrographs. The type of water level recorders used in \n\nthe gauging stations was not always the best, considering the small water depths and the \n\noccasional changes on the channel surface, resulting from some sedimentation associated \n\nwith major rainfall events. Although frequent field visits and manual data acquisition \n\nmade it possible to correct streamflow data series, this took several months to achieve.  \n\nVandalism and theft significantly affected data acquisition by parts of the monitoring \n\nnetwork. This was particularly the case with the streamflow record from Iparque and \n\nMina, where the resultant short and broken flow records and uncertainties of their quality \n\nprevented them being included in the analysis. In addition, theft of soil moisture sensors \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7 \u2013 FINAL DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMENDATIONS \n\n \n\n248 \n\ninstalled in woodland runoff plots also hindered continuous data acquisition at different \n\nsoil depths. Soil sampling and soil moisture measurements in the laboratory were the \n\nalternative solutions found, but they did not allow monitoring of soil moisture behaviour \n\nthrough rainfall events.  \n\nAs regards surface water quality assessment, few storm events were able to be sampled \n\nas a result of limited human resources, particularly to perform laboratory analysis. The \n\nanalytical methods used for different water quality parameters were largely determined \n\nby the laboratory conditions and equipment. Thus the high detection limits of the heavy \n\nmetal analytical procedures constrained the assessments of spatio-temporal variations in \n\nmetal concentrations. Also the study was not able to include assessment of chemical \n\nparameters, such as biochemical oxygen demand, as well as oils and fats, that are usually \n\nconsidered as important urban pollutants.  \n\n \n\n7.8. Fields for future research \n\nA prime need of future research will be the incorporation of more detailed information of \n\nthe artificially constructed urban drainage system in order to improve the understanding \n\nof the connectivity, between different urban land-uses and the stream network. This \n\ninformation, coupled with the field data acquired, should be used as data inputs for, and \n\nto calibrate and validate, spatially-distributed hydrological models. The application of \n\nmodelling tools will allow an improved assessment of the impact of the location and \n\nextension of different landscape mosaic features, as well as the testing of future \n\nurbanization scenarios and the best locations for mosaic elements and mitigation \n\nmeasures. Such information should be coupled with flood risk assessment and should \n\nguide future catchment management.  \n\nFurther investigation of surface water quality is also important. Greater spatial and \n\ntemporal resolution of water sampling is required in order to identify pollutant sources, \n\ntheir transport mechanisms and understand the seasonal variation on surface water \n\nquality. Identifying critical source areas and their connectivity with the stream network \n\nover the year is needed in order to select appropriate preventive measures and settings, \n\nwhich may be specific to different target pollutants. Water quality data should be also \n\nconsidered together with the hydrological modelling, so that best spatial arrangement of \n\nland-uses is based upon both flood risk management and aquatic ecosystems protection. \n\nThis research has also highlighted some complementary themes that should be \n\ninvestigated in the future, such as establishing practical guidelines and rules to provide \n\nhydrological connectivity breaks, which should be considered under current planning \n\nlegislation and catchment management.     \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n249 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n  \n\n\n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\n250 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nLAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL \n\nPROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS \n\n \n\n251 \n\nA \n\nAddiscott, T.M., Whitmore, A.P., Powlson, D.S., 1991.
