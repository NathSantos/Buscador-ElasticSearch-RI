Na d\u00e9cada de 30 foram avistados os primeiros animais emaranhados e, na d\u00e9cada \n\nde 60, come\u00e7aram a ser reportados animais mortos pela ingest\u00e3o de pl\u00e1stico. Atualmente, \n\neste problema afeta todos os oceanos em todas as profundidades e uma quantidade \n\nsignificativa de lixo continua a ser produzida diariamente. Esta amea\u00e7a, resultado de anos \n\nde um deficiente tratamento de res\u00edduos e da ignor\u00e2ncia face ao destino dos materiais \n\ndepositados no mar de forma descontrolada, tem-se tornado mais consp\u00edcua. Isto deve-se \n\n\u00e0 acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de res\u00edduos s\u00f3lidos nas zonas costeiras, provenientes tanto de terra como \n\nde mar. Assim, o aspeto est\u00e9tico do lixo acumulado nestas zonas, juntamente com o \n\naumento de avistamentos de animais emaranhados atraiu, nos \u00faltimos anos, a aten\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\npopula\u00e7\u00e3o e da comunidade cient\u00edfica. O problema do lixo marinho intensificou-se devido \n\n\u00e0 evolu\u00e7\u00e3o da composi\u00e7\u00e3o dos materiais descartados. Antigamente, apesar dos materiais \n\nserem descartados de forma impr\u00f3pria, estes eram biodegrad\u00e1veis, o que provocava \n\nimpactos reduzidos para o ecossistema. Com a intensifica\u00e7\u00e3o do uso do pl\u00e1stico como \n\nmaterial de baixa densidade, duradouro, resistente, relativamente barato e extremamente \n\nvers\u00e1til, o ato de descartar incorretamente estes res\u00edduos passou a ter graves \n\nconsequ\u00eancias. A lenta degradabilidade do pl\u00e1stico, o facto de a maioria ser constitu\u00eddo \n\npor poluentes org\u00e2nicos persistentes (POP) e de apresentar uma elevada toxicidade, s\u00e3o \n\nalgumas das caracter\u00edsticas que tornam o material mais usado atualmente, uma grave \n\namea\u00e7a ao meio ambiente. Apesar da relev\u00e2ncia dada ao pl\u00e1stico, o lixo marinho, de \n\norigem antropog\u00e9nica inclui muitos outros materiais, tamb\u00e9m prejudiciais ao meio \n\nambiente, como o vidro, papel, res\u00edduos sanit\u00e1rios, res\u00edduos m\u00e9dicos, metal, vestu\u00e1rio, \n\nolaria e outro tipo de poluentes. Esta problem\u00e1tica tem-se revelado de tal forma \n\nimportante que a sua monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 essencial para avaliar a quantidade, o tipo, a \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o e a origem do lixo marinho. \u00c9 neste sentido que o lixo marinho foi designado \n\ncomo um dos descritores da Diretiva Quadro Estrat\u00e9gia Marinha (DQEM), diretiva esta \n\nque tem como principal objetivo alcan\u00e7ar ou manter o Bom Estado Ambiental das \u00e1guas \n\nmarinhas e costeiras at\u00e9 2020. O descritor 10 da DQEM, que indica que as propriedades \n\ne a quantidade do lixo marinho n\u00e3o prejudicam o meio costeiro e marinho, necessita de \n\numa boa caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o do mesmo. Para tal, a diretiva estabelece dois grandes \n\nindicadores: as caracter\u00edsticas do lixo marinho no meio costeiro e marinho e os impactos \n\n\n\niv \n\n \n\ndo lixo na vida marinha, sendo a monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o um dos principais componentes deste \n\nprimeiro indicador. Atualmente, as amostragens realizadas na praia s\u00e3o o tipo de \n\nmonitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o mais comum da zona costeira, uma vez que estas n\u00e3o s\u00f3 permitem a \n\nrecolha de uma grande quantidade de informa\u00e7\u00e3o, como podem ser realizadas sob \n\npraticamente quaisquer condi\u00e7\u00f5es atmosf\u00e9ricas, apresentando custos reduzidos. Existem \n\nv\u00e1rios fatores que influenciam a ocorr\u00eancia do lixo marinho nas praias, sendo que as \n\nprincipais s\u00e3o: as caracter\u00edsticas do lixo; a din\u00e2mica das praias; as condi\u00e7\u00f5es atmosf\u00e9ricas; \n\nos padr\u00f5es de circula\u00e7\u00e3o oce\u00e2nica, a limpeza das praias e as pr\u00e1ticas recreativas e \n\ncomerciais realizadas em \u00e1guas oce\u00e2nicas. Neste \u00e2mbito foi realizado um estudo para \n\nrelacionar a presen\u00e7a do lixo marinho com as caracter\u00edsticas da costa, de modo a perceber \n\ncomo esta rela\u00e7\u00e3o pode influenciar poss\u00edveis programas de monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o, enquadrando \n\na necessidade de monitorizar o lixo marinho no \u00e2mbito da DQEM. Esta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nmestrado teve tamb\u00e9m como objetivo relacionar os diversos tipos de lixo marinho \n\nencontrados com as suas fontes, encontrando indicadores que auxiliassem essa \n\nidentifica\u00e7\u00e3o. Foram assim amostradas onze praias em Portugal, entre o outono de 2014 \n\ne a primavera de 2015. A quantidade e o tipo de lixo foram amostrados adaptando o design \n\nda Conven\u00e7\u00e3o para a Prote\u00e7\u00e3o do Meio Marinho do Atl\u00e2ntico Nordeste (OSPAR). Foram \n\natribu\u00eddas determinadas caracter\u00edsticas \u00e0s praias como a extens\u00e3o da praia; o tipo de \n\nsubstrato (classificado de acordo com a sua granulometria) e a exist\u00eancia de urbaniza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\n(se as praias eram ou n\u00e3o urbanizadas). O declive e a dist\u00e2ncia ao estu\u00e1rio foram \n\ncaracterizadas por compara\u00e7\u00e3o entre as diferentes praias. Estas caracter\u00edsticas foram \n\nposteriormente relacionadas com a quantidade do lixo atrav\u00e9s de uma PERMANOVA. \n\nAs diferen\u00e7as significativas obtidas na an\u00e1lise anterior foram exploradas utilizando o teste \n\nSIMPER. Para visualizar estas rela\u00e7\u00f5es foi realizada uma An\u00e1lise de Coordenadas \n\nPrincipais (PCO). Para identificar as poss\u00edveis fontes do lixo encontrado, foram \n\nestabelecidos indicadores baseados nos tr\u00eas principais tipos de lixo encontrados para cada \n\npraia e para cada esta\u00e7\u00e3o do ano. A principal categoria de lixo encontrado nas praias foi \n\no pl\u00e1stico (pl\u00e1stico &lt;2.5cm e os pellets), sendo seguido pelo papel (beatas) e pelos \n\nres\u00edduos sanit\u00e1rios (cotonetes). A quantidade de lixo foi influenciada tanto pelas \n\ndiferentes praias como pelas diferentes esta\u00e7\u00f5es do ano. Todas as esta\u00e7\u00f5es do ano \n\napresentaram tamb\u00e9m diferen\u00e7as significativas e as praias com uma maior m\u00e9dia de \n\ndissimilaridade foram Sesimbra e Ma\u00e7\u00e3s, Ma\u00e7\u00e3s e S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o e, por fim, Figueirinha \n\ne Ma\u00e7\u00e3s. O pl\u00e1stico foi o principal tipo de lixo respons\u00e1vel por estas diferen\u00e7as. A PCO \n\nn\u00e3o mostrou uma boa rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre as diferentes caracter\u00edsticas das praias e o lixo, \n\n\n\nv \n\n \n\ndestacando, no entanto, a praia das Ma\u00e7\u00e3s das restantes. As praias que foram classificadas \n\ncomo urbanas apresentaram maior quantidade de lixo, bem como as praias que se \n\nencontravam mais perto de estu\u00e1rios. No geral, verificou-se uma maior quantidade de lixo \n\nno outono e na linha da mar\u00e9 alta, e n\u00e3o na linha da vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o como aconteceu noutros \n\nestudos desta tem\u00e1tica. Embora n\u00e3o tenha sido poss\u00edvel identificar a maioria da origem \n\ndo lixo, que foi, na generalidade, considerado como lixo de origem mista, as categorias \n\nde lixo que corresponderam ao conjunto de indicadores espec\u00edficos, propostos pela \n\nOSPAR, foram os cotonetes (res\u00edduos sanit\u00e1rios) e as linhas de pesca e caixas de \n\npescadores (pescas, incluindo aquacultura). \u00c9 ainda de salientar a elevada presen\u00e7a de \n\nbeatas de cigarros, cuja origem foi atribu\u00edda, por experi\u00eancia dos investigadores, \u00e0 \n\nrestaura\u00e7\u00e3o e \u00e0s pessoas que frequentaram as praias. Estes resultados demonstram que o \n\nlixo identificado como terrestre teve maioritariamente origem na restaura\u00e7\u00e3o e nos \n\nfrequentadores das praias e num potencial d\u00e9fice na gest\u00e3o de tratamento de \u00e1guas. No \n\nlixo identificado como de origem marinha, a maioria foi devida \u00e0 atividade pesqueira e \n\nao transporte de mercadorias por via mar\u00edtima, devido \u00e0 quantidade de pellets \n\nencontrados. Devido \u00e0 elevada quantidade de lixo de reduzidas dimens\u00f5es encontrada \n\n(como peda\u00e7os de pl\u00e1stico &lt;2.5cm, pellets, beatas e cotonetes), pode-se deduzir que a \n\nlimpeza da praia \u00e9, de certa forma, ineficaz para o lixo de reduzidas dimens\u00f5es. \u00c9 \n\nimportante referir que tamb\u00e9m foram identificados v\u00e1rios tipos de embalagens \n\nalimentares e de bebidas, bem como copos de pl\u00e1stico e palhinhas. Estes items, embora \n\nn\u00e3o tenham correspondido \u00e0 maior percentagem dentro da categoria de pl\u00e1stico, \n\nevidenciam a falta de sensibiliza\u00e7\u00e3o da popula\u00e7\u00e3o para o problema do lixo marinho. \n\nConsiderando a enorme import\u00e2ncia da monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o do lixo marinho e da determina\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda sua fonte \u00e9 interessante realizar estudos futuros de modo a eliminar o problema na \n\norigem. Estes estudos poder\u00e3o relacionar os diferentes transportes do lixo marinho, como \n\no vento e as correntes, com a sua distribui\u00e7\u00e3o. Analisar em que medida as condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\natmosf\u00e9ricas influenciam a quantidade de lixo na zona costeira \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m um dos \n\nposs\u00edveis objetos de estudos futuros.  \n\n\n\nvi \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\n \n\nMarine litter has been recognized as a serious environmental problem and \n\ntherefore, it has become an important field of study. With an estimated eight million items \n\nbeing discarded, every day, in oceans and seas, marine litter represents a threat to the \n\nmarine environment. Monitoring marine debris became a relevant topic of research as \n\nmarine litter is one of the descriptors of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. This \n\nstudy relates the different characteristics of the coast of Portugal (urbanization, slope, \n\ndistance to estuary and length) with the type and abundance of marine litter found on \n\neleven beaches. The surveys were conducted following a transect approach method, \n\naccording to the OSPAR design. After identified, the litter was related to the coast \n\ncharacteristics through a PERMANOVA, a SIMPER and a PCO analysis. Specific \n\nindicators were established in order to determine the source of the litter. The main types \n\nof litter found were plastic, paper and sanitary waste. The majority of litter was classified \n\nas having mixed origin, despite some litter could be identified as having land and marine \n\norigin. The sources of marine litter identified were sanitary and sewage-related waste, as \n\nwell as fisheries, including aquaculture. This study related the assessed litter with the \n\ncharacteristics of the coast and, when possible, attributed their sources. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nKeyWords: Marine litter, Monitoring, MSFD\n\n\n\nvii \n\n \n\n \n\nTable of contents \n\nChapter 1: General Introduction .................................................................................... 1 \n\nChapter 2: Relationships between marine litter and type of coastal area: implications for \n\nthe design of monitoring plans ........................................................................................ 5 \n\n2.1.

This problem started to receive more attention in the \n\n60s and nowadays it is well visible in all oceans and in almost all depths (Ryan, 2015) \n\nbeing recognized as one of the most insidious ocean pollution issues (Sheavly, 2005). A \n\nsignificant amount of litter is produced every day and the trend is an increase in the overall \n\nproduction (Bergmann et al., 2015).  \n\nMarine litter can have its origin in either land or ocean-based sources, although it \n\nis estimated that about 80% of the litter existing in the ocean comes from land (Sheavly \n\net al., 2005). The litter originated on land can come from multiple sources and sites near \n\nthe coast, normally associated with activities related to the sea, such as ports, marinas and \n\ndocks. The litter that is transported by rivers, the one that comes from the waste water \n\ntreatments and the one that comes from untreated sewage can also be considered as land \n\norigin. The litter that is brought by storms, winds and rain is also considered of land \n\norigin, since it is washed from coastal areas and can end in the marine environment. \n\nOcean- based litter comes mainly from the various activities that occur in the sea, such as \n\ntouristic related activities like personal watercraft and cruises, and transportation of goods \n\nand fishing (UNEP, 2009).  \n\nMarine litter can be classified into several categories like plastic, wood, medical \n\nand sanitary waste, clothes, metal, glass and paper. Each type has its own properties and \n\ntherefore they are usually found in different sites, wherein plastic is undoubtedly the most \n\ncommon type (Derraik, 2002; Santos et al., 2008). Due to its characteristics, such as light \n\nweight, durability, strength and buoyant properties (Andrady and Neal, 2009), plastic was \n\nconsidered by Madzena and Lasiak (1997) the most difficult type of debris to control, \n\nsince it disperses far from origin. Plastics are usually found in all sites, from the bottom \n\nto the surface of the seas, as well as on beaches (Galgani et al., 2000; Moore et al., 2001; \n\nReisser et al., 2013).  \n\nOver the years the impacts caused by marine litter have been documented \n\nworldwide. Entanglement and ghost fishing can cause superficial injuries but it can also \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\nlead to more serious problems as injuries that, although not causing death, damage the \n\nanimals\u2019 feeding and reproductive abilities. What started as superficial injuries can also \n\ndevelop to serious infections. These impacts can also decrease the ability to escape from \n\npredators and cause changes in the behavior of animals.  \n\n(Lais, 1997; Trouwborst, 2011). Over the years, the entanglement problem has been \n\ndocumented in multiple studies and organisms, such as in marine mammals (Henderson, \n\n1985; Kraus, 1990); in marine birds (Day et al., 1985) and turtles (Balaz, 1985). The ghost \n\nfishing problem has also been reported in a few studies as Carr et al. (1985) showed for \n\nNew England. The ingestion of debris, mainly of plastics, is also worrying since the \n\nanimals can get a false sense of satiation (Secchi and Zarzur, 1999). This ingestion can \n\nalso be responsible for the introduction of toxic chemicals into the marine food webs, \n\nsuch as Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP) that affect not only those who ingest them \n\nbut also top predators (Trouwborst, 2011).  \n\nMarine litter can also be a transport and dispersion vector of invasive species, \n\nwhich can jeopardize the endemic species of certain regions (Gregory 2009). The \n\nsmothering of the ocean floor caused by the litter that sinks is also a less known but also \n\nimportant impact (Trouwborst, 2011), as well as the public safety that can be threatened \n\nby injuries caused on beaches or by leaching of poisonous chemicals (Cheshire et al., \n\n2009). It is also relevant to consider that the aesthetic impact caused by marine litter \n\ndiminishes the well-being of the population and that can cause negative impacts in the \n\ntourism of the affected area (Cheshire et al., 2009).  \n\nThe rate at which litter enters the system and at which it is removed influences the \n\nlitter accumulation (both in seas and beaches) (Cheshire et al., 2009). Besides that, the \n\nproximity to large cities, the occupation and use of the shore and the maritime and \n\nhydrodynamics activities can also influence the accumulation rates of debris (Galgani et \n\nal., 2015). Tidal cycles, ocean currents, winds and regional-scale topography are \n\nresponsible for marine litter deposition and distribution (UNEP, 2009). Coastal regions \n\nare where litter accumulates the most, since they suffer an extreme pressure with the \n\npopulation growth and with the uncontrolled development that are related to estuaries \n\nactivities (Kennish, 2002). Estuaries do not escape from marine litter, what is worrying \n\nconsidering their ecological importance (Blaber et al., 2000).  \n\nConsidering that when the litter that reaches the sea becomes part of the common \n\nocean, Thor Heyerdahl (1971) stressed out the importance of the mistake of considering \n\nthe existence of territorial waters when it comes to this problem, highlighting the \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nimportance of international agreements to protect the common ocean for future \n\ngenerations (Morrison, 1999). It is important to consider this question since, from the \n\nmoment that litter reaches the sea, it becomes an international problem. Therefore, the \n\nlitter has no owner and no one can be legally responsible for it (McIlgorm et al., 2011).  \n\nAs a result, it is crucial to monitor this problem in order to identify the source and \n\nminimize or reduce the problem. Therefore, marine litter was considered one of the eleven \n\ndescriptors used to define the Good Environmental Status until 2020, under the Marine \n\nStrategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Acting as a binding directive, MSFD can be \n\nconsidered as a supplementary community legal framework that can be used by present \n\nand future community members to develop new conservation measures, or enhance \n\nexisting ones (Markus et al., 2011). This directive is the pillar of the Integrated Maritime \n\nPolicy (IMP) of the European Union (Markus et al., 2011) and obliges the member states \n\nto follow an action plan that includes the initial assessment of the environmental status \n\nand to establish a series of environmental goals and the associated indicators (Van \n\nFraneker et al., 2010; Galgani et al., 2014). The Descriptor 10 of the MSFD defined good \n\nenvironmental status as the situation when properties and quantities of marine litter do \n\nnot cause harm to the coastal and marine environments. To support the characterization \n\nof this descriptor, four indicators were described: trends in amount of litter washed ashore \n\nand/or deposited on coastlines; trends in amount of litter in water column (including \n\nfloating on the surface) or deposited on sea floor, trends in amount, distribution and, when \n\npossible, composition of micro-particles and, finally, trends in the amount and \n\ncomposition of litter ingested by marine mammals (Galgani et al., 2013).  \n\nDespite the consensus in monitoring marine litter, to assess the status of debris \n\nfound on beaches, the method to be applied can be variable (Ara\u00fajo &amp; Costa, 2007). \n\nStudies on marine litter have been conducted on beaches (e.g. Caulton &amp; Mocogni, 1987; \n\nRoss et al., 1991; Moore et al., 2001), on the sea floor (e.g. Watters et al., 2010; Mordecai \n\net al., 2011) and in open waters (Thiel et al., 2013). However, to monitor trends in the \n\namount of litter washed ashore and/or deposited on the coastline (as described in one of \n\nthe indicators of Descriptor 10), beach surveys are the approach used since it allows a \n\nlarger sample size at minimal cost and it can be done in almost all weather conditions. \n\nBeach surveys are also cheaper since they require very little equipment (Rees &amp; Pond, \n\n1995) and have an important role in raising awareness of the population to this problem, \n\nsince they can use volunteer work. Besides, debris tends to accumulate on beaches and \n\nwhen there is non-floating debris, it can be stranded on the shore (Dixon &amp; Dixon, 1981). \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nIn this way it is possible to assess the quantity of types of litter that would be difficult to \n\nassess in any other way (Dixon &amp; Dixon, 1981). Although having these numerous \n\nadvantages, this type of survey has its flaws. Dixon and Dixon (1981) referred that beach \n\nsurveys gives a distorted picture of the composition of marine litter, because each type of \n\nlitter has its own characteristics, which means that some litter tends to accumulate on \n\nbeaches whilst other types degrade more easily, never reaching the beaches. This can \n\ncause an underestimation of the surveyed litter.  \n\nMany different beach methodologies have been used, ranging from different types \n\nof transects (e.g. Rosevelt et al., 2013; Frost &amp; Cullen, 1997), to the identification of \n\nspecific (e.g. Martins &amp; Sobral, 2011; Wright et al., 2013) and/or all types of litter (e.g. \n\nMoore et al., 2001). This causes an incompatibility problem since the results with \n\ndifferent methodologies can hardly be compared (OSPAR, 2010). Taking into \n\nconsideration, programs have been created to try to unite countries regarding this matter \n\nand to try to create a single methodology that can effectively enable comparison of the \n\nresults.  \n\nOSPAR, the Convention for the Protection of the marine Environment of the \n\nNorth-East Atlantic, is a conventiom to which Portugal is a signatory country. Under this \n\nframework the signatory parts have the obligation to fight and prevent the pollution, as \n\nwell as to protect the seas against the human activities. The convention released a \n\nguideline for monitoring litter that was tested in OSPAR Pilot Project 2000-2006 \n\n(OSPAR, 2010). This was an important step to survey and monitor marine litter, guiding \n\nthe North-East Atlantic countries in monitoring of marine litter of MSFD.  \n\nGiven the importance of monitoring marine litter, and the fact that the Portuguese \n\ncoastline is vulnerable to the accumulation of plastic (Martins &amp; Sobral, 2011) and \n\npossibly to other types of litter, it is important to analyze the influence of the different \n\ntypes and characteristics of the coastline in the abundance of marine litter. This is the \n\nfundamental objective of the present study, since the purpose was to analyze the main \n\npatterns of occurrence throughout the year, in coastal areas with different characteristics, \n\naiming to provide recommendation for monitoring plans design. \n\n  \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nChapter 2: Relationships between marine litter and type of coastal \n\narea: implications for the design of monitoring plans \n\n \n\n2.1. Introduction \n \n\nIn recent years, marine litter has become an extremely important issue that has \n\npromoted studies with the purpose of understanding the effects of marine debris in \n\norganisms and to assess the damages in the marine ecosystem, at a short and a medium \n\nterm. This problem has been neglected for a long time as a result of the common practice \n\nof ocean dumping. In the past decades, this practice was not so harmful because the \n\nresidues then were biodegradable (Sheavly &amp; Register, 2007), contrary to today. It was \n\nthe aesthetic aspect that initially brought the attention of the scientific community and \n\ngeneral public (Gregory 2009).  \n\nMarine debris has been defined as items that were made and used by people and \n\nthat were deliberately discarded into the rivers, sea or on beaches; that were brought \n\nindirectly to the sea with sewage, rivers, winds or storm water, that were accidentally lost \n\n(including material lost at sea in bad weather) or that were deliberately left by people on \n\nbeaches and shores (UNEP, 2009). It is estimated that 8 million items are being dumped, \n\nevery day, in oceans and seas, accumulating 6.4 million tons per year \n\n(www.unep.org/regionalseas/marinelitter - accessed 28/09/2015, 22:07; www.ospar.org \n\n\u2013 accessed 28/09/2015, 22:23).  \n\nMarine litter can originate from two major sources: the ocean-based sources and \n\nland-based sources. The ocean-based sources are all the activities that take place at sea, \n\nsuch as merchant shipping, ferries and cruise liners, including fishing and aquaculture. \n\nLitter from all the land-based sources come from coastal or inland areas, as well as from \n\nrivers or other water bodies (UNEP, 2009). However, whichever the source, marine litter \n\ncan have various impacts on the environment. Serious impacts on wildlife have been \n\nreported, such as entanglement of many marine species, which is a serious mortality factor \n\n(Gregory, 1999; Galgani et al., 2010). The accidental ingestion of plastic that mimic prey \n\ncauses serious injuries (in special the ingestion of microplastics) and the consequent entry \n\nand input on the food chain of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP) and other chemicals \n\n(Katsanevakis et al., 2007; Martins &amp; Sobral, 2011). The dispersion and the spread of \n\ninvasive alien species caused by floating debris and the accumulation of litter on the \n\nseabed are also of concern. This accumulation, sometimes in large quantities, changes the \n\nlocal biotope characteristics, affecting the benthic communities and consequently the \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nmobile communities that depend on them (Sheavly &amp; Register, 2007; Martins &amp; Sobral, \n\n2011). Besides all the impacts to the wildlife, marine litter is also a serious problem \n\nregarding the presence of medical and hygiene wastes that are not retained in the \n\ntreatment system of wastewater, which represents a risk to public health (Sheavly &amp; \n\nRegister, 2007). Tourism is also very affected by this problem, which leads to economic \n\nlosses, especially due to beach cleaning activities of the bathing areas (Corbin &amp; Singh, \n\n1993; Galgani et al., 1995; Sheavly &amp; Register, 2007). \n\nThe type and abundance of marine litter found on the coastline depends on several \n\nfactors, among which are the proximity to urban and industrial centres, the circulation \n\npatterns of the oceanic currents and the shipping routes (Sheavly &amp; Register, 2007). The \n\ncoastal waters are the most critical areas regarding this problem. According to Dixon &amp; \n\nDixon (1981), the composition of marine litter is also more variable closer to the shore, \n\nbecause coastal waters are normally shallower, directly affected by the river flows \n\n(Holdgate &amp; McIntosh, 1986) and because they have the pressure from urban and \n\nindustrial centres (Santos et al., 2005).  \n\nMarine litter can be classified into several categories: plastic; wood; medical and \n\nsanitary waste; clothes; metal, glass and paper. The majority of studies shows that the \n\nmajor type of residues is plastic, that have many forms and sizes (Derraik, 2002). Due to \n\ntheir abundance (Rees &amp; Pond, 1995) and non-degradable nature (Laist, 1987), plastics \n\ndeserve a special attention, since these properties enhance the severity of its impacts. \n\nConsidering the widespread distribution of litter (e.g. Carpenter &amp; Smith Jr.., 1972; Dixon \n\n&amp; Cooke, 1977) and the need to protect and conserve the marine environment, a series of \n\nconventions and initiatives at an international level was triggered. The Convention on the \n\nPrevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (London \n\nConvention), signed in 1972, was the first international convention for the protection of \n\nthe marine environment from human activities. The aim of this convention was to \n\npromote the control of all sources of marine pollution and the prevention of pollution by \n\ndumping of wastes and other materials in the sea (www.imo.org,- accessed 11/08/2015, \n\n10h50). The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships \n\n(MARPOL), adopted in 1973, is the main international convention that covers marine \n\npollution by ships. Its Annex V (Prevention of Pollution by Garbage from Ships) defines \n\nthe different types of litter whose discharged is prohibit and specifies the distances to the \n\ncoast and the methods used to dispose of residues. (www.imo.org \u2013 accessed 11/08/2015, \n\n17h10).  \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nAt the regional level, the Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment \n\nof the Baltic Sea Area (Helsinki Convention), was signed in 1974 and it is governed by \n\nthe Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission (HELCOM). It has the purpose \n\nof protecting the marine environment from all types of pollution (www.helcom.fi - \n\naccessed 10/08/2015, 13h12). The Mediterranean Countries adopted, in 1976, the \n\nConvention for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against Pollution (Barcelona \n\nConvention). Among the various objectives, this convention aims to assess and control \n\nmarine pollution (http://www.unepmap.org \u2013 accessed 10/08/2015, 14h00).  \n\nA mechanism to approach marine litter problems was created, in 1992, through \n\nthe establishment of a cooperation between fifteen Governments and the European Union \n\nto cooperate in the protection of the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic. It is \n\nthe result of the union of the Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by \n\nDumping from Ships and Aircrafts (Oslo Convention, 1974) and the Convention for the \n\nPrevention of Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources (Paris Convention, 1978) \n\n(Galgani et al. 2010; www.ospar.org \u2013 accessed 5/07/2015, 10h48). The signatory parts \n\nof OSPAR (Convention for the Protection of the marine Environment of the North-East \n\nAtlantic) have the obligation to fight and prevent the pollution, as well as protect the seas \n\nagainst the human activities (http://www.dgrm.mam.gov.pt \u2013 accessed 05/07/2015, \n\n11h40; http://www.ospar.org \u2013 accessed 05/07/2015, 12h01). The United Nations \n\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP) was created as a global environmental authority that \n\npromotes the implementation of the environmental dimension of sustainable development \n\nwithin the United Nations system, acting as an authoritative advocate for the global \n\nenvironment (http://www.unep.org - accessed 05/07/2015, 14h56). \n\nConsidering that the most effective measure to reduce marine litter is to find the \n\nsource and reduce it (Gilligan et al., 1992; Cullen &amp; Frost, 1997; Earll et al., 2000; \n\nWilliams &amp; Tudor, 2001; Cunningham &amp; Wilson, 2003; Santos et al., 2005; Ara\u00fajo et \n\nal., 2006; Ara\u00fajo &amp; Costa, 2007), linking the marine debris to their source is an extremely \n\ndifficult task that can only be achieved with monitoring actions. Thus, marine litter is one \n\nof the descriptors of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), which is \n\nfundamental to achieve the good environmental status of marine waters until 2020 \n\n(Directive 2008/56/CE; Galgani et al., 2013). This descriptor is referred as Properties and \n\nquantities of marine litter do not cause harm to the coastal and marine environments. One \n\nof the steps to characterize it is assessing the trends in amount of litter washed ashore \n\nand/or deposited on coastlines (Galgani et al., 2013).  \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nThere have been multiple monitoring studies with the purpose of assessing marine \n\nlitter, wherein beach surveys have been the most chosen methodology to assess coastline \n\n(Ribic, 1990; Ribic et al., 1992). This method allows a reproducible and representative \n\nsample (Cunningham &amp; Wilson, 2003), guaranteeing a large amount of samples at a \n\nminimum cost, since the equipment required is minimal. These surveys can also be \n\nperformed virtually under any weather conditions (Rees &amp; Pond, 1995; Cuomo et al., \n\n1998) and it is a place that tends to accumulate several objects that come from different \n\nsources, through the action of winds, waves and currents (Martinez-Ribes et al., 2007). \n\nDespite these numerous advantages, this method also has some disadvantages, like the \n\nunderestimate of the amounts of debris, since not all litter items reach the shore (Dixon \n\n&amp; Dixon, 1981). The data collected on beach surveys can also be considered non \n\nrepresentative of the condition of the coastline, because the choice of beaches depends on \n\nits easy access (Rees &amp; Pond, 1995).  \n\nBecause the quantity of debris on a beach depends on debris characteristics, beach \n\ndynamics, weather conditions, oceanic circulation patterns, beach cleaning and the \n\noffshore recreation and commercial practices, there are different sampling strategies \n\naccordingly to the various types and sizes of debris (Rees &amp; Pond 1995). Gilligan et al. \n\n(1992) surveyed the litter in all the length of the surveyed sites, from the low tide line to \n\nthe high tide line. Frost &amp; Cullen (1997) established 5 transects with a width of 10m, from \n\nthe low tide line to the vegetation line, separated 10m from each other. Valender &amp; \n\nMocogni (1998) assessed marine litter within the 5 main strand lines that are formed as \n\nthe tide recedes. Debrot et al. (1999) also surveyed transects that were placed in the \n\nmiddle of the beach, with a width of 8.5 to 150m. Cunningham &amp; Wilson (2003) \n\nestablished 27 parallel to the shoreline transects of 5m width and Ara\u00fajo et al. (2006) \n\nused 4 transects of 50m width, placed from the low tide line to the vegetation line. Ara\u00fajo \n\net al. (2007) observed the entire study area by walking along the shoreline, starting the \n\nsurvey two hours before low tide. Ribic et al. (2010) sampled 500m and Top\u00e7u et al. \n\n(2012) placed 2m width transects parallel to the coast. Finally, Rosevelt et al. (2013) \n\nestablished 2 transects against the wrack line, separated by 5m. Given the variability of \n\neach site features, the methodologies applied varied relative to the extension of the \n\nsampling area and the way marine debris was surveyed (Quintela et al., 2012).  \n\nConsidering the non-comparability of the results obtained in many of the previous \n\nstudies, in 2010, OSPAR published Guidelines for Monitoring Beach Litter, as a formal \n\nmonitoring instrument (Galgani et al., 2010), based on a pilot project. This instrument \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nwas delineated to generate data on marine litter, following a standardized methodology, \n\nensuring a practical and cost-effective way to conduct monitoring. The selection of the \n\nbeaches should take into account that beaches should be composed by sand or gravel, as \n\nwell as being exposed to the open sea; be of easy access to the removal of litter and be \n\naccessible all year round; have a minimal length of 100m or over 1km, be free of buildings \n\nall year round and, ideally, should not be subject to other litter cleaning activities. \n\nHowever, in this document it is also noted that each coastal area has its own \n\ncharacteristics and that this protocol should be adjusted if necessary (OSPAR, 2010). \n\nAccording to OSPAR, the researchers should choose one of the survey lengths (100m or \n\n1km). If the chosen one was the 100m survey, all the surveyed litter has to be removed \n\nfrom the site and, in case it is large object, it should be marked to avoid being surveyed \n\nagain. This guideline recommended that the surveys should be done four times per year, \n\naccording to the seasons and also provided a survey form, a multilingual photo guide, a \n\nphoto guide for regional and unusual items and a practical field photo guide to assist the \n\nfieldwork.  \n\nThe OSPAR Pilot Project on Monitoring Marine Beach Litter (2007) was the first \n\nregion-wide project in Europe to develop a unique methodology for monitoring the debris \n\non North-East Atlantic beaches (Galgani et al., 2010). This study presented the results of \n\nthe types and amount of litter surveyed in six years, including the description of indicator \n\nitems that could correspond to a specific source. Although this study has showed that the \n\nIberian coast did not register as much litter as the northern regions, it was registered that \n\nPortugal has canyons with large quantities of litter (Mordecai et al., 2011), despite being \n\nas distant as  is the case of the seamount in A\u00e7ores (Pham et al., 2013). Martins &amp; Sobral \n\n(2011) also referred the vulnerability of the coast of Portugal to plastic accumulation on \n\nbeaches (both from land and marine sources). Therefore, Portugal is no exception \n\nregarding the influence of marine litter and it is important to monitoring this problem. As \n\nsuch, the purpose of this work is to relate the presence of marine litter with some coastal \n\ncharacteristics, in order to analyze how this relationship influences the monitoring that \n\nshould exist within the scope of Marine Strategy Framework Directive (following the \n\nmethodology of OSPAR) and assess the main origins of the surveyed litter. \n\n  \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n2.2. Material and Methods \n \n\n2.2.1. Study Area \n\n \n\n In order to assess the type and amount of marine litter, beach surveys were \n\nconducted, similar to what has been done in several other studies (e.g. Frost &amp; Cullen, \n\n1997; Cunningham &amp; Wilson, 2003; Ara\u00fajo et al., 2007; Ribic et al., 2010; Top\u00e7u et al., \n\n2012; Rosevelt et al., 2013). These surveys have been accepted as the best cost-effective \n\nmethodology to study marine litter (Rees &amp; Pond, 1995) because of the simple logistic \n\ninvolved and because beaches allow accumulation of litter that does not float. \n\nConsidering the importance of relating the amount of marine litter with some \n\ncharacteristics of the coast, eleven beaches (Figure 1) were randomly chosen and \n\nsurveyed.  \n\nAlmost all surveyed beaches had sandy substrate and they all are highly \n\nfrequented in the summer. Santo Amaro, Carcavelos, Sesimbra, Portinho da Arr\u00e1bida and \n\nFigueirnha are facing south, while S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, Ma\u00e7\u00e3s, Grande, Castelo and Fonte da \n\nTelha are facing West. S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, Ma\u00e7\u00e3s, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Castelo and Fonte da Telha have \n\nNorth/Northeast prevailing winds, while the others had Northeast as prevailing winds \n\n(APA, 2013). Two beaches belong to the Arr\u00e1bida Marine Protected Area, which \n\nhighlights the importance of marine conservation. The selected beaches also presented \n\nthe recommended characteristics by OSPAR to monitor the marine litter (Guideline for \n\nMonitoring Marine Litter on the Beaches of the OSPAR Maritime Area, 2010).  \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSince the type and abundance of marine litter are influenced by the morphology \n\nand topography of the beach (Valender &amp; Mocogni, 1999), a good classification of the \n\nsurveyed sites allows a better understanding of the litter present in the coast. Considering \n\nthis, the surveyed beaches were characterized according to length, substrate, slope, \n\ndistance do estuary and urbanization, as shown in Table 1. For such characterization, it \n\nwas used information of the \u201cPerfil de \u00c1gua Balnear do Minist\u00e9rio da Agricultura, do \n\nMar, do Ambiente e do Ordenamento do Territ\u00f3rio\u201d. The features slope and distance to \n\nthe estuary were defined, through comparison between the surveyed sites, since the \n\npurpose was to classify the beaches in groups.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Surveyed beaches in this study: S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o (39\u00ba0\u201943.87\u201dN; 9\u00ba25\u201915.88\u201dW), Ma\u00e7\u00e3s (38\u00ba49\u201931.44\u201dN; \n\n9\u00ba28\u201910.93\u201dW), Grande (38\u00ba48\u201949.18\u201dN; 9\u00ba28\u201940.29\u201dW), Carcavelos (38\u00ba40\u201944.67\u201dN; 9\u00ba20\u201910.55\u201dW), Santo \n\nAmaro (38\u00ba41\u20195.45\u201dN;9\u00ba18\u201937.26\u201dW); S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o (38\u00ba39\u201930.79\u201dN; 9\u00ba15\u20198.31\u201dW), Castelo (38\u00ba36\u201949.44\u201dN; \n\n9\u00ba12\u201959.05\u201dW), Fonte da Telha (38\u00ba34\u201923.23\u201dN; 9\u00ba11\u201943.94\u201dW); Sesimbra (38\u00ba26\u201932.31\u201dN; 9\u00ba5\u201955.42\u201dW), \n\nPortinho da Arr\u00e1bida (38\u00ba28\u201949.23\u201dN; 8\u00ba58\u201945.84\u201dW) and Figueirinha (38\u00ba29\u20192.38\u201dN; 8\u00ba56\u201940.50\u201dW \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Characteristics of surveyed beaches \n\n \n\n \n\nThe sampling scheme followed in this study was adopted from OSPAR. Transects \n\nwere used to survey the beaches, as done in multiple studies such as Thornton &amp; Jackson \n\n(1998) and Williams &amp; Simmons (1999). The three transects were placed in the centre of \n\nthe beaches, separated by 50 m, from the low tide line to the vegetation line. The \n\nplacement of these transects was recorded by photograph in order to assure that the same \n\nstretch of the beach was consistently surveyed during the study period. Each transect was \n\nmarked by a nylon cable of 4/5mm thickness and distance was measured with a measuring \n\ntape. It is important to notice that each beach had different widths and that, in order to be \n\npossible to compare the amount and type of litter present in the different zones of the \n\nbeach (low tide line, high tide line and vegetation line), it was necessary to divide each \n\ntransect into areas of twenty square meters (10 m x 2 m). These areas were marked \n\ndirectly in sand and this scheme is represented in Figure 2.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBeach Length (m) Substrate Slope Distance to estuary Urbanization \n\nS.

The buried litter was considered \n\nimportant since it is significant and has to be considered for a more correct analysis and \n\nmonitoring of the marine litter in beaches (Kusui &amp; Noda, 2003). The litter was collected \n\nand stored for later analysis in the laboratory, following the Guideline for Monitoring \n\nMarine Litter on the Beaches in the OSPAR Maritime Area (2010). \n\nWith the purpose of sampling the maximum area possible, the surveys were \n\nconducted on days with equinoctial tides, according to the methodology of Frost &amp; Cullen \n\n(1997) and Rosevelt et al. (2013).The beaches were also sampled one hour and a half \n\nbefore the low tide, since this time was enough to cover all the extension of the selected \n\nbeaches. The surveys were conducted quarterly from September, 2014, to June, 2015. \n\nThe OSPAR Marine Litter Monitoring Survey Form was followed in order to \n\nidentify and register the type of debris. However, after the survey trial it was verified that \n\nsome amendments to the survey form were necessary. The category plastic/polystyrene \n\npieces (0-2.5 cm; 2.5-50 cm and >50 cm) was separated into two different categories due \n\n10m \n\nFigure 2 - Survey\u2019s scheme representing the three transects (distanced by 50m each), \n\nestablished from the low tide to the vegetation line. Each transect was divided into squares \n\nof 10x2m. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\nto the high number of individual polystyrene pieces encountered, which could influence \n\nthe final results. Considering its relevance in recent marine litter studies (Carpenter &amp; \n\nSmith Jr., 1972; Andrady, 2011; Claessens et al., 2011) and because a high number of \n\nthis type of item was recorded during the trial survey, the category pellets was added to \n\nthe list of marine debris. Thus, the material required for this work was three nylon cables; \n\ntwo rakes with a net covering of 2x2 mm; plastic bags to collect the litter items; labels to \n\nidentify the bags, gloves to catch the litter and a measuring tape. \n\n \n\n2.2.2. Sampling method \n\n \n\nTo assess the influence of the characteristics of beaches and season in the marine \n\nlitter recorded, a permutational multivariate ANOVA (PERMANOVA) was done (using \n\nthe program Primer 6 version 6.1.13 &amp; Permanova + version 1.0.3). The data was \n\ntransformed using a square root transformation, so that the results were not influenced by \n\nthe dominant or rare categories. A resemblance matrix was built using Bray-Curtis \n\nsimilarity (Mckinley et al., 2011; Castro et al., 2013;). If PERMANOVA showed \n\nsignificant effects, pair-wise tests were carried out, among all factors. A SIMPER test \n\nwas made to identify the types of litter responsible for the significant differences among \n\nbeaches and seasons. A PCO was made to visualize the relationship between litter and \n\nthe beach characteristics. All this analysis were done using the Primer 6 version 6.1.13 &amp; \n\nPermanova + version 1.0.3.Sesimbra and Grande beaches were withdrawal of the analysis \n\nfor Winter and Spring for having too many null values that affected the results. \n\n Considering that tackling the source is probably the most important outcome of \n\nmonitoring marine litter, in order to identify possible sources of the litter surveyed in this \n\nstudy, indicator objects for land and marine activities were used. The objective was to \n\nfind some specific type of litter that could be considered an indicator, representing \n\npossible sources for marine litter. To consider a litter item as a marine litter indicator, the \n\nitems should be typical for the source it represents, common and frequent in the survey \n\narea and easy to identify, find and count (OSPAR, 2007). \n\nFirst, for each beach and each season, the most abundant type of litter was \n\ndetermined. Thereafter, this type was identified as having either a terrestrial or a marine \n\norigin, following the methodology of Silva-I\u00f1inguez et al. (2003). When the items had a \n\ndoubtful origin, they were designated as having mixed origin. After this general \n\ncharacterization, general and specific indicators were identified, with the purpose of \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nassessing the origin of the litter surveyed. These indicators were established following \n\nthe criteria of OSPAR (OSPAR Pilot Project on Monitoring Marine Beach Litter - \n\nMonitoring of marine litter in the OSPAR region, 2007), taking into account the \n\ninformation from Ribic et al. (1998). This characterization was done based on the three \n\nmost abundant types of debris found on each beach and at each season. The litter that was \n\nmore represented in a particular beach and that was an important indicator of the origin,  \n\nwas also taken into account. .If some type of litter was not dominant but it was distinctive \n\nof a specific beach, it was also taken into account. \n\n  \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\n2.3. Results \n \n\n A total of 7 743 items belonging to eleven litter categories were collected from all \n\nbeaches (0.55 item m-2). Plastic, paper and sanitary waste were the predominant types of \n\nlitter in this study, with plastic as the most abundant item (Table 2). The litter showed a \n\nclear spatial pattern whereas the high tide line was the one with more litter, with a total \n\nof 4 783 items (2.3 items m-2), followed by the vegetation line, with 1 681 items (1,50 \n\nitems m-2) and by the low tide line, with 1 279 items (0.58 items m-2) (Table 3). Only the \n\nlow and high tide lines had statistical significant differences (H (2, N=33)=6.2494; \n\np=0.044)), with a p-value of 0.048. The amount of litter was higher in the autumn season \n\n(4569 items), followed by winter (2269 items) and spring (905 items). \n\nOf the 11 surveyed beaches, Ma\u00e7\u00e3s was the one with a higher number of marine \n\nof litter (3 483 items), followed by Carcavelos (987 items). S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o and Sesimbra \n\nwere the beaches with less litter registered (201 and 113 items, respectively). \n\nMa\u00e7\u00e3s had the greatest amount of plastic (2817 items) and sanitary waste (382 \n\nitems), whereas Santo Amaro had the greatest amount of paper (327 items) and presented \n\nthe highest diversity of types of litter, along with Fonte da Telha (Table 2). \n\n \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Number of items of each type of litter collected in each beach \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Plastic Rubber Cloth Paper Glass \nSanitary \n\nWaste \n\nMedical \n\nWaste \nWood Metal Pottery \n\nOther \n\nPollutants \n\nS\u00e3o \n\nLouren\u00e7o \n118 0 0 60 5 6 0 0 7 0 5 \n\nMa\u00e7\u00e3s 2817 6 4 228 17 382 7 12 12 0 10 \n\nGrande 390 0 0 3 0 9 0 0 0 0 1 \n\nCarcavelos 644 0 0 195 2 133 6 2 4 0 1 \n\nSanto \n\nAmaro \n194 2 3 327 2 35 2 5 20 1 4 \n\nS\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o 285 4 0 50 1 39 4 2 2 0 0 \n\nCastelo 185 1 0 41 1 26 3 0 4 0 0 \n\nFonte da \n\nTelha \n242 1 1 176 7 26 2 4 5 2 1 \n\nCalif\u00f3rnia 96 0 0 8 3 4 1 1 0 0 0 \n\nPortinho da \n\nArr\u00e1bida \n457 1 0 35 14 23 2 3 6 16 4 \n\nFigueirinha 138 0 1 141 4 24 1 4 10 2 0 \n\nTotal 5566 15 9 1264 56 707 28 33 70 21 26 \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nTable 3 - Number of items of marine litter found in each beach zone (low tide line, high \n\ntide line and vegetation line) \n\n \n\nThe PERMANOVA results show that both the beaches (Pseudo-F = 7.675, p = \n\n0.001) and the seasons (Pseudo-F = 8.281, p = 0.001) have an influence in the amount of \n\nlitter found (Table 4).

In autumn, litter collected on the beaches of Portinho da Arr\u00e1bida and Sesimbra \n\nwere identified as having marine origin (since pellets were the most common item). In \n\nwinter, litter found in Santo Amaro was considered of land based origin, since the main \n\nlitter item was cigarette butts. Ma\u00e7\u00e3s\u2018s litter was considered of marine origin (main type \n\nwas pellets). It is important to point out that the litter found in Fonte da Telha, Portinho \n\nda Arr\u00e1bida, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Castelo, Carcavelos and Grande had land-based origin, due to the \n\npresence of cigarette butts found, that were related to beachgoers and the presence of \n\nrestaurats.  \n\nIt is important to point out that with the exception of Sesimbra a lot of debris  was \n\nfrom land-based origin, including the amount of cotton bud sticks found in all beaches,. \n\nFigure 3 - PCO for the amount of litter found in each beach and it\u2019s relation to the characteristics of the \n\nbeaches: urbanization, distance to estuary, length, slope and type of substrate. \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nThe majority of cigarette butts was found in the last squares, what can be due to \n\nbeachgoers. Ma\u00e7\u00e3s was the site where the largest amount of fisheries and aquaculture \n\nrelated waste was recorded, since a large number of fish boxes, rope (with a diameter \n\nbigger than 1cm), string and cord (diameter less than 1cm), nets and pieces of net &lt;50cm \n\nand light sticks (tubes with fluid) was collected from this beach. Figueirinha, where a \n\nlarge number of stripping bands was found, had a considerable amount of litter from \n\nshipping, including offshore activities \n\n  \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\n2.4. Discussion \n \n\n The purpose of this work was to relate the presence of marine litter with some \n\ncoast characteristics, in order to understand how this relationship influences the \n\nmonitoring that should exist within the scope of Marine Strategy Framework Directive \n\n(following the methodology of OSPAR) and assess the main origins of the surveyed litter. \n\n The amount of litter found along the coastline was inferior to the values of litter \n\nregistered in other studies, as registered by Silva-I\u00f1inguez et al. (2013), 1.52 items m2, \n\nand it was superior to others studies such as Smith &amp; Markic (2013), with 0.24 items m2. \n\nThe surveyed sites in this study suffered the influence of Tejo and Sado estuaries which, \n\naccording to Vasconcelos et al. (2007), are subject to high pressure, with Tejo being more \n\naffected by population and industry and Sado, from port activities and resource \n\nexploitation. Tejo also has the port of Lisboa, which is the second largest port in Portugal \n\n(Vasconcelos et al., 2007), which has a strong influence in the pollution verified. \n\nConsidering these characteristics, it was expected that the beaches closer to the estuaries \n\nhad more litter than the others (Ara\u00fajo &amp; Costa, 2007).  \n\n In general, the group of beaches that were classified as far from the estuary, that \n\nincluded three beaches (Ma\u00e7\u00e3s, S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o and Grande), revealead a higher abundance \n\nof litter than the group of the remaining six beaches (Figueirinha, Portinho da Arr\u00e1bida, \n\nS\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Castelo, Santo Amaro and Carcavelos) classified as closer to estuaries. This \n\nresult can only be explained by the high amount of litter found on Ma\u00e7\u00e3s since, if Ma\u00e7\u00e3s \n\nwas removed from the analysis, the group of beaches closer to the estuary would have \n\nmore debris,  as expected. However, there is not an explanation for Ma\u00e7\u00e3s to have more \n\ndebris than the beaches closer to estuaries, such as Carcavelos because, even with Colares \n\nstream reaching the sea next to Ma\u00e7\u00e3s beach, the beaches closer to estuaries should have \n\nmore litter. Two possible explanations could be the behaviour of the beachgoers and the \n\nfact that the other beaches, due to their proximity to a large urban tourist centre, like \n\nCascais, are cleaned more regularly contributing to minimizing the accumulation of \n\nmarine litter. Another possible explanation can be simply because Ma\u00e7\u00e3s is located in the \n\nWest coast, more exposed to prevailing winds that come from North and to wave \n\ninfluence (Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico, 2013). Sesimbra and Grande were interesting cases \n\nbecause both of them did not have litter in winter and, in spring, low amounts of litter \n\nwere recorded.  \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\n The beaches that were considered urban were expected to have more litter than \n\nthe non-urban (Ariza et al., 2008). This was verified in Ma\u00e7\u00e3s, Carcavelos and Santo \n\nAmaro. Sesimbra beach was an exception since, although it was classified as urban, it \n\nwas the one with less abundance of marine litter. This can be due to Sesimbra having a \n\nsmaller width, when compared to the others, which implies that the litter does not have \n\ntime to accumulate on the beach, due to influence of the tides.  \n\n Determining the source of debris was extremely difficult because all beaches had \n\nalmost all types of litter, which meant all types of origin. So, in general, the majority of \n\nlitter was designated as mixed origin. However, it was possible to identify the specific \n\nsources of the most common litter in some beaches. In Sesimbra (autumn) and Ma\u00e7\u00e3s \n\n(winter), the source of litter was identified as marine origin, which could mean that, in \n\nthese sites, there is a high influence of ocean currents or winds. On the contrary, Santo \n\nAmaro\u2019s litter (winter) was identified as land origin, which demonstrates a clear terrestrial \n\ninfluence, mainly from the beachgoers. It is interesting to notice that, the source of litter \n\nfound in Portinho da Arr\u00e1bida, varied according to the season. In winter, it was identified \n\nas marine origin and in autumn as land origin. This could mean that this beach may be \n\nmore influenced by winds and/or currents in winter that in autumn, bringing during this \n\nseason the litter from marine origin. A great number of cotton buds was collected in \n\nalmost all beaches,  which shows that as in other countries (e.g. Moore et al., 2001; Santos \n\net al., 2005), this is a problem, and the same happens with the presence of medical waste. \n\nThis is worrying since syringes and medication packages found, can cause injuries in \n\nbeach goers and, ultimately, represent a risk to human health. Plastic was the most \n\nabundant item, as in other studies (e.g. Santos et al.,2009; Gago et al.,2014).. \n\n It was not possible to obtain a good relationship between the surveyed litter and \n\nthe beach characteristics. This lack of relation can be due to the homogeneity of the \n\nsurveyed litter. The only identifiable pattern was Ma\u00e7\u00e3s that showed a clear separation \n\nfrom the other beaches. Ma\u00e7\u00e3s was also related to the urban occupation, which \n\ncorresponds to its characterization as an urban beach.  \n\n It is important to notice that, as expected, a spatial pattern along the coastline was \n\nobserved. The high tide line was expected to have more litter, as well as the vegetation \n\ntide line, due to the fact that in the first case the tide tends to bring the litter to the beach \n\n(Valender &amp; Mocogni, 1999) and in the second ,because the vegetation usually traps and \n\nretain debris (Ara\u00fajo &amp; Costa, 2007).  \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\n The seasonal variability observed in the abundance of marine debris on beaches \n\nwas not in agreement with the expected one since it was expected to collect more litter in \n\nwinter due to the periods of heavy seas, storms and rain, as registered by Ribic et al. \n\n(2010). The higher abundance of litter during autumn may be a consequence of the \n\nexceptional good weather conditions that were registered in the autumn if 2014, which \n\nbrought beachgoers to visit the beach, when the cleaning operations were not so common.  \n\n It is important to notice that despite the recommendations of OSPAR, the \n\nsurveyed beaches were cleaned by the municipality during the time of the experience. \n\nHowever, this situation was minimized by the fact that, in the period of the surveys, the \n\nbeaches were only cleaned sporadically. Also, if there was evidence that the beach had \n\nbeen clean, the sampling was carried out on another day. In this way, it was guaranteed \n\nthat the beaches were not surveyed in the same day that were cleaned.  \n\n There are also some aspects related to the methodology chosen to survey the \n\nbeaches, i.e., the width and number of transects, that need to be discussed. Several studies \n\nhave used transects wider than the ones used in the present study, as was the case of \n\nDebrot et al. (1999), who used a 8.5 to 150 m width transect, as Kusui &amp; Noda (2003) \n\nwith 10 m width transect and as Bravo et al. (2009), with 3 m width transects. In the case \n\nof Ara\u00fajo et al. (2006), it was demonstrated that it was necessary to have a transect with \n\nminimum 20 m width to qualitatively characterize the plastic items. Despite Ara\u00fajo et al. \n\n(2006) study focused on plastics, their results may be applied to other types of litter. As \n\nfor the number of the transects, although this study had only three, Valender &amp; Mocogni \n\n(1999) showed that for a medium panorama evaluation 10 transects would be acceptable, \n\nfrom the vegetation line to shoreline. Despite all of this, the methodology of this study \n\nwas adopted because there were only two investigators and, if there were more and wider \n\ntransects, the effort would be enormous.  \n\n It is also important to notice that as demonstrated by Williams &amp; Tudor (2001), \n\nthe beaches have the capacity to bury the debris. Therefore it is necessary to be cautious \n\nabout this study\u2019s results since the litter that was considered as a new input could only be \n\nburied and for some reason have been unearthed (due to tides or winds). So it is relevant \n\nto bear in mind that beach surveys do not give a full representation of the marine litter \n\n(Thiel et al., 2013), being important to relate this study\u2019s findings with others, such as the \n\none made by Mordecai et al., 2011, in submarine canyons.  \n\n As UNEP (2009) referred, there has been a lack of political commitment regarding \n\nthis problem. Therefore, more political efforts must be done, as well as a more \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\ninvolvement of the population in this matter is very important, in order to raise awareness \n\nto the fact that marine litter is a global problem, and not just a regional one, and that the \n\nsea is a valuable natural and economic resource that needs to be protected.  \n\n With this study, despite the lack of a clear relation between the characteristics of \n\nthe beaches and the amount of litter collected, it was possible to identify some of the \n\norigins for the litter present in the coastline. It is important, in future studies, to relate the \n\nlitter distribution with the different types of marine litter transports vectors (such as winds \n\nand currents). It is also important to understand how atmospheric conditions influence the \n\namount and distribution of litter in the coastline.  \n\n   \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nChapter 3: Final Remarks \n\n \n\nThe purpose of this work was to relate the different characteristics of coastal areas \n\nwith the occurrence of marine litter and to learn the implications for the design of \n\nmonitoring plans. Plastic, paper and sanitary waste were the predominant types of debris \n\nfound in the study area. In general, the main items were plastic (0-2.5cm), polystyrene \n\n(0- 2.5cm) and cigarette butts, also considering the high number of cotton bud sticks \n\ncollected. The high amount of the last items, demonstrates that it is necessary to educate \n\nthe population and evaluate the flaw in the water waste treatment, in order to find a \n\npractical way of stopping the cotton bud sticks to enter the sea. \n\nRegarding the sources of the marine debris collected, the majority was considered as \n\nhaving a mixed origin. However, the litter identified as having a land origin was mainly \n\ndue to the beachgoers and the litter identified as having a marine origin was mainly due \n\nto the item pellets, which can originate from spillage of cargo in oceanic waters, during \n\ntransportation.  \n\nMa\u00e7\u00e3s was the beach with the highest quantity of marine litter, contrary to \n\nSesimbra where the lowest values were observed. The analysis of the quantity of litter \n\nalong the beach showed that the highest number of debris was found in the high tide line, \n\nfollowed by the vegetation line. This suggests that if the monitoring studies focus on this \n\npart of the beach, the survey would catch an important amount of litter and it would reduce \n\nthe costs and effort to survey the entire beach. Autumn was the season with the highest \n\namount of litter. Despite considered in the OSPAR Guideline, monitoring beaches during \n\nsummer in Portugal proved to be a difficult task. It was not possible to conduct the \n\nsummer survey due to the strong and constant presence of beachgoers and to the fact that \n\nthe beaches are cleaned every day. Thus, monitoring marine litter in Portugal, in this \n\nseason, would be strongly affected by both aspects influencing the data obtained.  \n\nThe baseline is that there is a need for more relevant information, considering the \n\nobjectives of Marine Strategy Framework Directive, that faces the challenge to achieve \n\ngood environmental status by 2020 (Galgani et al., 2013). To do so, it is necessary to \n\nevaluate the main problems of each European Union Member State, which can only be \n\nachieved with the recognition of the seriousness of the marine litter problem. In Portugal, \n\nwithin the framework of the implementation of MSFD, an effort to put into practice \n\nprojects as BDLixList and LiMar, that have the purpose of quantifying the marine litter \n\non the coast (creating a national database), and to determining bioindicators for the \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nDescriptor 10 to be applied to Portuguese marine waters (Programa de Monitoriza\u00e7 ao? e \n\nPrograma de Medidas - Annex IV (2014).  \n\nIt is important to complement the present study in order to understand the \n\ndynamics of marine litter in Portugal. Similar monitoring studies should be done \n\nencompassing a higher time period, as done by Ribic et al 2010, and considering others \n\nfactors, such as the weather and current information at the time of the survey, considered \n\na week or two before and as done by Cunnigham &amp; Wilson (2003). Further studies could \n\nalso apply different methodologies, in order to understand how effective a type of survey \n\nfor the site particular characteristics is. Relate the different types of litter transport with \n\nthe amount of litter, establishing a relationship of cause and effect could be an interesting \n\nstudy, as well as to assess how the oceanic currents influence the coastline litter, \n\nidentifying the nationality of the litter. As most marine debris are land-source it is \n\nimportant to  dedicate studies to estuaries and rivers in order to quantify how much litter \n\n(and what type) is transported down the river to reach the sea, as done in Moore et al., \n\n(2011).  \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\nChapter 4: References \n\n \n\nAndrady, A.
