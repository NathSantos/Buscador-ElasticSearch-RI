Verificou-se que estas membranas \napresentaram bons resultados na identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1cidos nucleicos por \nSERS.  \nA s\u00edntese e caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o do \u00f3xido de grafeno que serviu de base para a \nprepara\u00e7\u00e3o dos nanocomp\u00f3sitos de prata e ouro foi objecto de estudo. A sua \nredu\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica com diferentes agentes redutores foi explorada, uma vez \nque o grau de redu\u00e7\u00e3o deste nanomaterial pode ser um fator determinante \npara a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o pretendida (intera\u00e7\u00e3o com biomol\u00e9culas).  \nA prepara\u00e7\u00e3o de nanocomp\u00f3sitos de \u00f3xido de grafeno com prata e ouro foi \nrealizada com diferentes agentes redutores. A atividade de SERS destes \nnovos nanocomp\u00f3sitos foi ent\u00e3o explorada na presen\u00e7a de v\u00e1rios analitos, \nem diferentes condi\u00e7\u00f5es de aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o dos espectros de Raman, bem como \nem diferentes tipos de suporte. Verificou-se que os nanocomp\u00f3sitos \npreparados com prata apresentaram a particularidade de permitirem a \nintensifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos sinais de Raman das bandas D e G do grafeno. \u00c9 de \nsalientar a introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de um novo agente redutor amigo do ambiente para \ns\u00edntese de comp\u00f3sitos de grafeno com nanopart\u00edculas met\u00e1licas: o extrato de \neucalipto. Outra vari\u00e1vel introduzida foi a prepara\u00e7\u00e3o de nanopart\u00edculas de \nouro em forma de nanoestrelas sintetizadas com hidroxilamina na presen\u00e7a \nde \u00f3xido de grafeno, tendo-se obtido assim um novo nanocomp\u00f3sito com \npotencialidades em SERS. \nCom o objectivo de preparar suportes para SERS com uma topografia e \nporosidade adequadas \u00e0 cria\u00e7\u00e3o de locais privilegiados para a agrega\u00e7\u00e3o de \nnanopart\u00edculas met\u00e1licas e para a penetra\u00e7\u00e3o das mol\u00e9culas do analito foram \nproduzidas mantas por electrofia\u00e7\u00e3o. Para tal, selecionaram-se os pol\u00edmeros \n\u00e1lcool polivin\u00edlico e poliacrilonitrilo. Com esta t\u00e9cnica preparam-se igualmente \nnanocomp\u00f3sitos de ouro ou prata e grafeno. Estudaram-se algumas vari\u00e1veis \nde s\u00edntese, tais como a introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de nanopart\u00edculas e nanocomp\u00f3sitos in \nsitu, (isto \u00e9, durante o processo de electrofia\u00e7\u00e3o), deposi\u00e7\u00e3o posterior das \nnanopart\u00edculas e dos nanocomp\u00f3sitos nas fibras polim\u00e9ricas (preparadas \npreviamente) e funcionaliza\u00e7\u00e3o superficial das mantas com o objectivo de \nligar os nanomateriais a posteriori. \nPor fim, foi tamb\u00e9m explorada a potencialidade em SERS de novas \nestruturas compostas por florestas de nanotubos de carbono com cobertura \nde ouro produzidas por deposi\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica de vapor. Verificou-se que a \ndetec\u00e7\u00e3o de bases de ADN e o pr\u00f3prio ADN \u00e9 poss\u00edvel usando estes \nmateriais. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n\n \nGraphene oxide, gold and silver nanoparticles, polymeric materials, \nnanocomposites, surface enhanced Raman scattering, electrospinning, \nvertically aligned carbon nanotubes. \n \n\nabstract \n\n \nThe present work aimed to explore the potential of new nanocomposites based \non carbon nanostructures and metal nanoparticles for the detection of \nbiomolecules through surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).  \nIn a first step, polyvinyl alcohol composites were prepared incorporating silver \nnanoparticles by two different reduction procedures. At first without introduction \nof carbon nanostructures. These composites showed good results for the SERS \nidentification of nucleic acids.  \nNext, the synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide was studied to be \nused in the preparation of silver and gold nanocomposites. The reduction of this \nnanomaterial with different chemical agents was explored, since its reduction \ndegree may be a determinant factor for the application envisaged (biomolecules \ninteraction).  \nThe preparation of the nanocomposites with silver and gold was performed with \ndifferent reducing agents. The SERS activity of these new nanocomposites was \nthen explored in the presence of different analytes, varying the experimental \nconditions for Raman spectra acquisition. It was interesting to verify that the \nsilver containing nanocomposites presented the particularity to intensify the \ngraphene D and G bands. It is also important to highlight that a new eco-friendly \nreducing agent was tested for the synthesis of the graphene oxide composites, \nan Eucalyptus Globulus extract. Other variable introduced was the preparation \nof gold nanostars synthesized with hydroxylamine in the presence of graphene \noxide, which allowed the preparation of a new nanocomposite with SERS \npotential. \nFibrous membranes were also prepared by electrospinning with the aim to \nprepare SERS supports with adequate topography and porosity for the \nformation of nanoparticles agglomerates for the creation of the so-called hot-\nspots and also to allow the penetration of the analyte molecules. The polymers \npolyvinyl alcohol and polyacrylonitrile were selected for electrospinning. Using \nthis technique, electrospun mantles with silver and gold nanoparticles and \nnanocomposites were prepared. Several variables were studied, such as the \nintroduction of the nano-fillers during the electrospinning process, later \ndeposition of the nano-fillers on the simple electrospun polymeric fibres and \nsurface functionalization of the simple polymeric membranes to link the nano-\nfillers.  \nAt last, the potentialities of using carbon nanotubes forests, produced by \nchemical vapor deposition and coated with gold film by sputtering, as new \nSERS substrates were explored. It was found that the SERS detection of DNA \nbases and ADN itself is possible using these substrates. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nvii \n\n \n\nOverall Index \n \n\n \n\n \nList of Abbreviations .................................................................................................................

Page 3 \n\n \n\n1.1. Introduction \n\nSpecific detection of proteins characteristic of some diseases plays an important role \n\nin biochemistry and biomedical research areas. In particular, the measurement of \n\ncancer biomarkers is of major importance for early detection and high reliability \n\nprognosis of such disease. This is a great challenge for the community that is \n\ndedicated to this type of scientific research, with the development of the interface \n\nbetween nanoscience and medicine one of the most interesting areas of science. \n\nRaman spectroscopy, in particular SERS (Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering) is a \n\nnew and very promising approach for specialized investigation due to its ability to \n\nidentify structurally a molecule with very high sensitivity1. The enhancement of \n\nRaman signals has been observed up to 106 getting the particular case of single \n\nmolecule detection. This notable enhancement provides high sensibility and offers an \n\nopportunity of development of ultra-sensitive analytical methods for chemical and \n\nbiochemical detection2. SERS has been used as a selective and sensitive method in the \n\ndetection of proteins and oligonucleotides 3.  \n\nDue to SERS recent development, it is expected that its applications are extended to \n\nthe analysis of cells and tissues. The first studies have already started to be done 1,4 \n\nhowever, more studies are needed to assess the advantages and disadvantages of \n\nSERS related to other techniques, particularly fluorescence microscopy that uses \n\nmolecular fluorophores and quantum dots. In the case of experiments in vivo with \n\nnanoparticles and SERS labels, the biodistribution and toxicity have been studied 5,6.  \n\nEighty years after the discovery of the Raman effect, conventional Raman scattering \n\nhas already made the transition to the clinics, for example, in the area of bacteria \n\nidentification or in surgery for online monitoring by fiber optic probes. The next years \n\nwill show whether SERS in targeted research as a relatively new approach will \n\nexperience a similar success story3.  \n\nSeveral research groups are actively working on improved designs of SERS probes \n\nwith high sensitivity and reproducible signals, and the number of biomedical SERS \n\napplications is constantly increasing3. However, a good enhancement of the Raman \n\n\n\n? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates \n\n \n\n? Page 4 \n\n \n\nsignal is required for the application to be successful being the SERS substrate the \n\nkey factor7. \n\nGraphene is a promising material to be used as SERS substrate. Recently, graphene \n\nby itself was reported as a clear inducer of the enhancement of Raman signal \n\nintensity in adsorbed molecules8-10.  This enhancement was attributed to charge \n\ntransfer between graphene and the molecules of the analyte. Graphene and gold \n\nnanocomposites have demonstrated good results as SERS substrates11 . The \n\narrangement between gold nanoparticles and graphene can attribute a unique \n\nmechanism of electronic transfer or energetic between both phases which allows the \n\nobservation of SERS. Also, silver nanoparticles were used in graphene-based \n\nnanocomposites to enhance Raman signals12. \n\nGraphene is aromatic, hydrophobic and chemical inert. It is also biocompatible and \n\nhas potential bioapplications13. Due to exceptional charge mobility and atomic \n\nthickness graphene was been proposed as the basis to sensitive detection and \n\nchemical/biological free-label14. Graphene oxide (GO) is the oxidated form of graphene \n\nand this derivative can interact with nanoparticles to produce structural \n\nnanocomposites after its reduction15. Moreover, being a two-dimensional \n\nnanostructure with an adjustable chemical surface,  functionalized graphene can \n\nproduce strong interfaces with biological systems without geometric limitations13. \n\nGraphene has also the facility to adsorb biomolecules due to ?-? stacking between its \n\nhexagonal cells and the carbon rings present in the majority of nano/biomolecules16. \n\nCurrently, graphene has been employed in several areas that go from chemical \n\nsensors to transistors. The majority is based on the electric properties. In the last few \n\nyears, researchers have become increasingly interested in developing SERS \n\nsubstrates based on graphene. In this work we will show the advances in this area. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates \n\n? Page 5 \n\n \n\n1.2. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering \n\n \n\n1.2.1. Description of SERS technique \n\nSERS is almost 40 years old. The first SERS spectrum was recorded in 1947 by \n\nFleischman and co-workers; and in 1977 it was shown by Jeanmaire and Van Duyne \n\nto possess what is surely the most iconic characteristic of SERS: a Raman cross-\n\nsection per molecule some million-fold larger than for the same molecule in solution17. \n\nIn these four decades, SERS phenomenon is not yet completely understood neither is \n\npredictable. The enhancement factor can be understood as a contribution of two \n\nmechanisms: (a) electromagnetic and (b) chemical. The electromagnetic mechanism \n\noccurs because the intensity of Raman scattering is directly proportional to the square \n\nof the induced dipole moment, \u00b5ind, which, in turn, is the product of the Raman \n\npolarizability, ?, and the magnitude of the incident electromagnetic field, E. As a \n\nconsequence of exciting the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of a \n\nnanostructured or nanoparticle metal surface, the local electromagnetic field is \n\nenhanced compared to Raman signal 18. This mechanism is consensual in research \n\ncommunity. \n\nIn the case of chemical mechanism, several theories are proposed: (i) metal-ligand \n\ncomplex formation19, (ii) the creation of new metal to molecule or molecule to metal \n\ncharge transfer resonances much like those that are common in transition metal \n\ncoordination complexes20, or (iii) the transient residence of hot electrons or electron-\n\nhole pairs out of the metal on the molecule21. The surface plasmon (SP) was described \n\nas a superposition of metal electron-hole pairs formed through isoenergetic transitions \n\nof magnitude equal to the frequency of SP. The hot electrons can transitorily reside on \n\nthe molecule added, forming a radical anion. So, it was suggested that the molecule \n\nadded can accelerate the dephasing of plasmon. Such processes occur without any \n\ndoubt in adsorbed-molecule-systems but are still a great deal to chemists and \n\nphysicists. Nevertheless, none of the models presented here have yet yielded a \n\nquantitative or predictive theory. So it is hard to say to what extent they contribute to \n\nthe enhancement17. \n\n\n\n? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates \n\n \n\n? Page 6 \n\n \n\nSome confusion in SERS remains between the concepts of ?surface-enhancement? and \n\n?very strong Raman cross-sections? which may be endemic to the analyte adsorbed, \n\neven when it is in solution. Molecules, such as Rhodamine 6G (R6G), a known SERS \n\nprobe, may have enormous Raman cross-sections and, therefore, their SERS spectra \n\nare very intense. If the molecule also fluoresces, Raman spectrum may only be \n\nrecorded when such florescence is quenched, as happens when the molecule is \n\nadsorbed on a metal surface, or by using ultrafast techniques, essentially recording \n\nthe Raman spectrum before the fluorescence intensity become greater, or when the \n\nsystem is stable enough to be able to overcome the shot noise, by using techniques \n\nthat allow register the difference of intensity and an appropriate signal acquisition \n\ntime. For that reason, a large Raman cross-section does not mean a large SERS \n\nenhancement17.  \n\nThe enhancement of Raman signal comes up to 1014 times higher than in conventional \n\nRaman scattering 22 and can detect quantities as small as single-molecule 23-25. The \n\ntwo major advantages of using SERS are the high sensitivity and molecular \n\nspecificity. Although SERS mechanism remains uncertain, these are the reasons why \n\nthis technique has being improved and medical applications and the design of \n\nportable devices for in vitro diagnosis are increasingly coming realities 26-28.  \n\n \n\n1.2.2. SERS substrates \n\nSince the first SERS spectrum was observed using a rough silver electrode, substrates \n\nhave started being developed: (1) substrates without uniformity prepared by \n\nelectrochemical oxidation \u2013 reduction cycles or by deposition in vacuum; (2) colloidal \n\nsolutions prepared by chemical synthesis and composed by nanoparticles with a big \n\nsize distribution; (3) nanoparticles with size and shape controlled by a chemical \n\nmethod; (4) nanostructured surfaces with size, shape and inter-particle spacing well-\n\nstructured prepared by self-assembly, mold or lithography; and (5) atom-thickness \n\nmaterials, such as graphene and graphene oxide, with or without metal nanoparticles \n\nintercalated. Specially, in the last two to three years, SERS substrates have been \n\nmore structurally controlled due to nanoscience and nanotechnology improvement.    \n\n\n\n? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates \n\n? Page 7 \n\n \n\nThe enhancement of the spectroscopic signal obtained can be 104 \u2013 106 for Ag, Au e \n\nCu, and 10 \u2013 104 for other transition metals, such as Fe, Co, Ni, Rh, Pd and Pt by \n\nusing substrates prepared by electrochemical oxidation-reduction cycles. This method \n\nis easy to use, produces stable substrates and their contamination have less chances \n\nto occur29,30. Colloidal suspensions of gold and silver nanoparticles started to be more \n\nused as SERS substrates after shape, size and composition of the nanoparticles could \n\nbe controlled by synthetic methods. Theoretical calculations indicate an enhancement \n\nof 103 \u2013 104, in the case of Au, and 106 e 107, for Ag31. Normally, SERS signals \n\nobtained by colloidal suspensions are weak. In order to improve this result, depositing \n\ncolloidal suspension of metal nanoparticles onto solid substrate is a common \n\ntechnique to prepare a nanoparticle monolayer to induce their coupling. Apart from \n\nbeing a very simple alternative it has shown very effective results. However, a \n\nnanoparticle monolayer may not have a uniform distribution and, therefore, SERS \n\nsignals are not similar from equivalent substrates. Best results can be achieved by \n\nconcentrating the colloidal suspension and controlling the drying time of the \n\nsuspension over the solid substrate32.  \n\nWith the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology, metal nanoparticles of \n\ndifferent sizes and shapes have been synthesized using various methods, such as \n\nchemical reduction, chemical replacement, electrochemical reduction, photochemical, \n\nthermal decomposition, and ultrasonic decomposition methods29. The most widely \n\nused and the simplest method is the chemical reduction, in which a metal salt is \n\nreduced to metal nanoparticles in aqueous or non-aqueous solution using reducing \n\nagents, such as sodium citrate, NaBH433, hydrogen34 or alcohols34. Normally some \n\nsurfactants, such as cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), poly(vinyl \n\npyrrolidone) (PVP), or sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), are added to the solution as \n\ncapping agents to prevent the aggregation or oxidation of nanoparticles. These agents \n\nhave also the function of regulating the growth rate to control nanoparticles shape \n\nand size. The type of metal salt, reductant, surfactant and their relative \n\nconcentration, the reaction temperature, and the solution pH influences the size, size \n\ndistribution, the shape, and the aggregation state of metallic nanoparticles 26,29. SERS \n\nsubstrates produced by metallic nanoparticles show some advantages: easy synthesis \n\nand low-cost; the size and shape can be controlled by reaction conditions in order to \n\nobtain the desired optical properties and maximize the enhancement signal effect; \n\n\n\n? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates \n\n \n\n? Page 8 \n\n \n\nnanoparticle aggregates can provide a higher enhancement in the specific sensitivity \n\n35,36.  \n\nThe methods to prepare highly ordered SERS substrates include the nanoparticle \n\nassembly method, the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) method, and lithography. A chemical \n\nassembly method is used to modify the solid substrate (Si, glass, indium tin oxide \n\n(ITO), or Au film) with bifunctional molecules. One molecular moiety interacts with \n\nthe solid substrate originating a compact layer and the other moiety interacts with \n\nthe nanoparticle through electrostatic or chemical interaction to form a well-arranged \n\nlayer of nanoparticles. Size, concentration, and surface charge of the nanoparticles, \n\nand the type do bifunctional molecules are the parameters of which depend the \n\nsurface coverage and uniformity of the assembled layer. In order to prevent the \n\naggregation of nanoparticles and to form a uniform substrate during the synthesis \n\nprocess, capping agents are usually added. However, the presence of the capping \n\nagent will lead to a large repulsion between nanoparticles and prevent the formation \n\nof a compact assembly layer. In the latter case, the electromagnetic interaction \n\nbetween nanoparticles is not highly effective and the SERS activity is low37. To \n\novercome this problem, further growth of the nanoparticles by chemical or \n\nelectrochemical methods has been proposed in order to reduce the interparticle \n\nspacing and increase the SERS activity38. The main advantage of this type of \n\nsubstrate, which gives an homogeneous SERS signal and has a significant surface \n\narea (up to several cm2), is that it can be produced in a normal laboratory without \n\ncomplicated equipment. An alternative method is to functionalize the Au nanoparticle \n\nsurface with CTAB to form a positively charged molecular bilayer which subsequently \n\nwill be deposited in an ITO substrate. This type of nanoparticles will not form \n\naggregates due to bilayer positive charge in their surface. The substrate has a very \n\nuniform SERS signal and good reproducibility and stability. One of the limitations is \n\nthe CTAB signal present in SERS spectra which implies poor results when this \n\nsystem is applied to detect some molecules that have weak interaction with the \n\nsubstrate or weak Raman signal. Although this method can effectively avoid the \n\naggregation of nanoparticles, allowing total surface of nanoparticle interacting with \n\nanalyte molecules, it is still difficult to obtain a defect-free surface and to obtain a \n\nsubstrate with a large area.  \n\n\n\n? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates \n\n? Page 9 \n\n \n\nAll the problems above described can be solved using Langmuir-Blodgett technique \n\nwhich originally was used to prepare amphiphilic molecular films with large area on \n\nsolid substrates39. By dissolving an amphiphilic molecule in a water-immiscible \n\nvolatile solvent and dispersing the solution on the surface of the aqueous phase it \n\nforms a molecular monolayer at the interface after solvent evaporation. By changing \n\nthe position of the movable barrier in the LB trough, one can change the density of \n\nthe monolayer film. The film can then be deposited on the substrate by the dipping \n\nand pulling method. By dispersion of the solution of metal nanoparticles into the \n\nwater phase, a layer of randomly distributed nanoparticles will be left at the interface \n\nafter the evaporation of the solvent. As a result of compression of the layer through \n\nmoving the barrier, an ordered layer of nanoparticles will be formed on the surface. \n\nDuring the compression process, the interparticle spacing will decrease, leading to \n\nstrong electromagnetic coupling between nanoparticles and a significant shift of the \n\nLSPR band. The nanoparticle film can then be deposited on glass or a Si wafer by \n\ntransfer to form a substrate with a surface area as large as 20 cm2. At present, the LB \n\ntechnique has been successfully used to fabricate SERS films of nanorods, nanowires, \n\nand spherical, cubic, cuboctahedral, and octahedral Ag nanoparticles40,41.  \n\nLithography of nanospheres can also be used to produce homogeneous substrates. \n\nAggregates of polystyrene spheres or silica with appropriate size deposited on a \n\nsubstrate (glass, ITO glass, silica or metallic film) form a multilayer film, where \n\nnanospheres are highly ordered and the conditions of aggregation are controlled. The \n\nformed film is used as template for vacuum deposition or electrochemical deposition to \n\nform on the template a metal film of the desired thickness29.  \n\nAs was described, a variety of methods such as chemical functionalization or \n\nlithography techniques can be used to immobilize plasmonic nanoparticles uniformly \n\non conventional substrates such as glass, quartz and silicon substrates (which are not \n\nflexible for standard use), but the substrates need to be flexible and easily processable \n\nfor the development of low cost sensors for everyday life applications. For that reason, \n\none of the future challenges ahead of researchers is the fabrication of SERS-active \n\ndevices that bring the technology from the laboratory to real-world applications7.  \n\nSome authors have already published some works that reveal this concern.

Aligned \n\nnanofibres act as micro-and nanochannels causing preferential alignment of the \n\nanisotropic Au nanorods along the fibre axis, resulting in globally anisotropic \n\nplasmonic and SERS properties. Such massive alignment of AuNRs, combined with \n\nthe porous polymer fibrous mat, which provides efficient access to the analyte, showed \n\nexcellent SERS effect. It is worth noting, that even with a modest density of Au \n\nnanorods on the surface of the electrospun fibres, the SERS intensity was \n\ndramatically enhanced compared to the planar counterpart. The porous nature of the \n\nnanofibrous mat enables efficient sorption and transport of the analyte molecules to \n\nthe surface of the Au nanorods facilitating the observed high SERS effect. \n\n \n\n1.3.  Carbon nanostructures \n\n1.3.1. Graphene and graphene oxide \n\nGraphene belongs to a new class of carbon nanomaterials composed by sp2 carbons \n\narrange in a honeycomb structure (Figure 1.1).  \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 \u2013 Graphene 2D structure \n\nSeveral experimentally measured properties of graphene have already surpassed \n\nthose observed in other types of materials. With enhanced electrical conductivity, high \n\n\n\n? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates \n\n? Page 11 \n\n \n\nmechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, high impermeability to gases and \n\noptical transparency, graphene holds great promise as the next wonder material. \n\nSuch an ideal is, however, achievable only if the large scale production of high quality \n\ngraphene is attained45. \n\nThe current state of graphene production is divided between two approaches \u2013 the \n\nbottom-up and top-down. The bottom-up approach seeks to build graphene sheets \n\nfrom scratch, starting with simple carbon-based molecules such as methane and \n\nethanol. On the other hand, the top-down approach relies on the fundamental idea of \n\nextracting layers of graphene from graphite. Both methods provide graphene of \n\ncontrasting quality and yield. However, in terms of high yield and low cost, the top-\n\ndown approach via chemical oxidation of graphite is the most convenient method to \n\ndate. Moreover, graphene obtained via such chemical treatments is important for a \n\nlarge portion of the graphene community that endeavours to use graphene in \n\napplications such as composites, coatings, paint/ink, transparent conductive layers, \n\nbioapplications and energy storage.  \n\n \n\n1.3.1.1. Graphene  \n\nAlthough ?graphene? is a term widely used for a variety of carbon-based materials, \n\nthe definition provided by IUPAC, in 1997 indicates that ?the term graphene should be \n\nused only when the reactions, structural relations or other properties of individual \n\nlayers are discussed.\u201d46. This misunderstanding happens because when graphene \n\noxide is reduced it restores almost the graphene structure but a certain amount of \n\noxygen groups remain in the structure, so it is important to know the differences \n\nbetween all the graphene derivatives (graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide) \n\nand graphene itself. \n\nGraphene can be produced by two approaches: bottom-up or top-down. At the first \n\none, graphene can growth by chemical vapour deposition (CVD), arc discharge or \n\nepitaxial growth 47-53. At the second approach, graphene is produced by \n\nelectrochemical process, sonication or micromechanical exfoliation. In fact, the latter \n\n\n\n? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates \n\n \n\n? Page 12 \n\n \n\nwas the method used to isolate graphene monolayer and gave Physics Nobel Prize, in \n\n2010, to Geim and Novoselov 54. \n\nGraphene is a single layer of honeycomb structure of carbons with sp2 hybridised \n\ncarbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice and partially filled ?-orbitals above and \n\nbelow the plane of the sheet. However, obtaining a single layer is an extremely \n\ndifficult process. In most cases, a structure with fewer layers of graphene is achieved \n\nand generally the properties refer to this group. In fact, the term ?graphene? is \n\ncommonly used to ?monolayer?, ?bilayer? or ?few-layer?. This categorization has been \n\nmade as the electronic properties of bi and few-layer (where ?few? is not rigorously \n\ndefined but is generally accepted as being &lt;10 layers) are distinct from the properties \n\nof graphite55. Besides the number of layers, the oxidation state is another important \n\nfeature in terms of characterization. As a single layer of carbon atoms, graphene is \n\nthe thinnest material known, yet it is impermeable to gases and it is stronger than \n\nsteel (Young\u2018s modulus ~ 1TPa)56. Moreover, thermal conductivity of graphene at \n\nroom temperature (up to ~ 5000 Wm-1K-1) rivals the values obtained for bundles of \n\ncarbon nanotubes and is over double the next thermal conductor known, the \n\ndiamond57. Being single layer, graphene also has an extremely high surface area with \n\na theoretical value of 2630 m2g-1 and is almost transparent, absorbing only ~ 2.3 % of \n\nwhite light58. Graphene has also shown good ?foldability? recovering its electrical \n\nproperties after bending and unbending[46].  \n\n \n\n1.3.1.2. Graphene oxide \n\nGraphene oxide was discovered much earlier than graphene. In 1840s, Schafhaeutl \n\nreported the intercalation of graphite using small-molecular species, such as an acid \n\nor alkali metal, between the carbon lamellae; the exfoliation of graphite was made \n\nwith sulfuric and nitric acid59. In 1859, Professor Brodie attempted to measure the \n\nmolecular weight of the graphite. For that purpose he has used nitric acid, potassium \n\nchlorate and heat the mixture. The material was washed and re-oxidised under the \n\nsame conditions up to four repetitions. The final product was termed ?graphic \n\nacid? and was the first sample of graphite oxide prepared experimentally60. In 1898, \n\nStaudenmaier improved the oxidation method by adding potassium chlorate in small \n\n\n\n? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates \n\n? Page 13 \n\n \n\nportions and further acidifying the mixture with concentrated sulphuric acid. The \n\nfinal product was practically the same but more convenient since it does not require \n\nfour repetitions of oxidation61.  \n\nIn 1958, Hummers and Hoffman presented a safer approach by using potassium \n\npermanganate as oxidant in a mixture of concentrated sulphuric acid and sodium \n\nnitrate62. The Hummers method was very well received and has been adopted by \n\nmany researchers. In an effort to improve the oxidation method, Marcano in 2010 \n\nreplaced in situ production using nitric acid with less corrosive phosphoric acid63. The \n\nmethod claimed to provide a more oxidised form of graphite oxide and highlighted a \n\nmore intact graphitic basal-plane. Besides that, the possibility for large scale \n\nproduction of graphene oxide seems possible since the method does not involve large \n\nexothermic or release toxic gases45. \n\nIn the last decade, graphene chemically modified has been the subject of intense study \n\nin the context of many applications such as polymer composites, energy storage and \n\nconversion, sensors, materials like ?paper?, field effect transistors (FET), and \n\nbiomedical applications, due to the excellent electrical, optical, and mechanical \n\nproperties38.  \n\nGraphene oxide consists in stacked carbon-based sheets with many oxygen functional \n\ngroups (carboxyl, hydroxyl, epoxide and carbonyl groups) which makes this compound \n\na good candidate for the above mentioned applications. The introduction of oxygen \n\nfunctionality groups significantly alter van der Waals interactions between the layers \n\nand endow GO with strong hydrophilicity. The presence of these functional groups \n\ndestroys the planar sp2 carbons of graphene and converts them to sp3 carbons by \n\ncovalent bond to oxygen (Figure 1.2). Therefore the ?-? electronic conjugation of \n\ngraphene is destroyed in GO, resulting in a significantly decrease in electrical \n\nconductivity64. \n\nNotably, it has been reported that the electrical conductivity of GO can be restored \n\nclose to the level of graphene by chemical reduction64. The electrical conductivity of \n\nreduced GO (rGO) achieves 200 \u2013 42000 Sm-1 depending on the reducing conditions \n\n(reduction time, temperature, annealing time, and annealing temperature) 65-67. The \n\nspecific capacitance of rGO has been found significantly higher than that of GO. \n\n\n\n? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates \n\n \n\n? Page 14 \n\n \n\nHowever, the dispersibility and transparency of rGO remains poorer than those of \n\npure GO. The reduction process removes oxygen-containing functional groups which \n\nresults in a decrease of rGO dispersability in different solvents. The restoration of ?-\n\nelectronic conjugation and the colour change from brown to black are the main \n\nreasons for the observed decrease in transparency64. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 \u2013 Graphene oxide structure and the oxygen functionality groups that can be formed after the \n\noxidation process 68,69. \n\n \n\n1.3.1.3. Reduction of graphene oxide \n\nThe reduction of graphene oxide (rGO) can be made by chemical, thermal, \n\nelectrochemical or a combination of these processes. In the chemical reduction there \n\nare several chemical compounds that can be used such as: hydrazine70, \n\nhydroquinone71, sodium borohydride72, ascorbic acid73, or poly (sodium 4-\n\nstyrenesulfonate)74. This type of graphene oxide reduction has been efficient and is \n\nnot an expensive process. The toxicity of the reducing agent is a concern due to the \n\nfinal applications of the reduced graphene oxide; hydrazine is one of the most toxic \n\nchemical used in the reduction of GO and ascorbic acid is labelled as eco-friendly \n\nreducer.  \n\nThermal reduction of GO is carried out by heating the GO in various atmospheres \n\n(ultra-high vacuum, Ar, H2, NH3), or with different heating sources such as \n\nmicrowave, flash light, plasma, electric current, or heated AFM tip. In this method, \n\noxygen functionalities are removed in the form of water, carbon dioxide, and carbon \n\nmonoxide. The results show that high conductivity could be achieved when GO is \n\n\n\n? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates \n\n? Page 15 \n\n \n\nsubmitted to this type of treatment75. In comparison to chemical and thermal \n\nreduction, electrochemical reduction of GO is green and fast, and the reduced material \n\nis contaminant-free. The electrical conductivity and electrochemical stability of rGO \n\nproduced by this method are higher than those of chemically or thermally obtained64.  \n\nIn addition to this three conventional reduction techniques, various other methods \n\nwere used to deoxygenate GO. Cote et al. reported a chemical-free flash reduction \n\nprocess using a photographic camera flash to instantaneously deoxygenates GO by \n\nphotothermal heating. The hydrophilicity of the flashed area was also significantly \n\ndecreased than that of pure GO. In comparison to the three conventional reduction \n\nmethods flash reduction is rapid, chemical-free, and energy efficient. This technique \n\nholds great promise for patterning GO films for device and composite applications76. \n\nThe choice of reduction method is made according to the final application purpose of \n\nrGO. For example, in the case of sensors where the combination of metal \n\nnanoparticles and rGO are used, chemical reduction is the most suitable technique \n\nbecause this process allows the simultaneous reduction of metal nanoparticles and \n\nGO. \n\n \n\n1.3.1.4. Graphene characterization by Raman spectroscopy \n\nRaman spectroscopy has been widely used in electronic properties characterization of \n\ngraphitic materials77-80 . Besides being non-destructive and fast, this technique allows \n\nthe characterization in terms of layers quantification and chirality of functionality \n\ngroups that modifies graphene 81,82. \n\nAccording to the electronic properties of graphitic materials, in Raman spectroscopy \n\nthe main important bands are between 1200 and 3000 cm-1. At 1350, 1580 and 2700 \n\ncm-1 are the bands denoted by D, G and 2D (or G\u2018), respectively 85,86 (Figure 1.3 - A). G \n\nband is associated to E2g phonon at the Brillouin zone center87 . D band specifies the \n\ndefects of graphitic material analyzed83. The 2D originates from a two phonon double \n\nresonance Raman process and because of that is closely related to the band structure \n\nof graphene layers 85-88.  \n\n\n\n? 1.

Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates \n\n? Page 17 \n\n \n\nA rapid and precise method to determining the number of graphene layers is needed \n\nin order to improve the graphene research and his applications. Although atomic force \n\nmicroscopy (AFM) measurement is the most direct way to identify the number of \n\ngraphene layers, the method has a very slow throughput. Furthermore, an \n\ninstrumental offset of ~0.5 nm (caused by different interactions forces) always exists, \n\nwhich is even larger than thickness of a graphene monolayer and data fitting is \n\nrequired to extract the true thickness of graphene sheets86. The obvious difference \n\nbetween Raman characteristic of graphene monolayer and graphite is 2D band \n\n(Figure 1.3 \u2013 B). For monolayer, the 2D band can be fitted with a sharp and \n\nsymmetric peak while that for graphite can be fitted with two peaks. The 2D band \n\nbecomes broader and blueshifted when the number of layers increases (Figure 1.4). \n\nWhen the Raman spectrum has a sharp and symmetric 2D band it is consensual say \n\nthat we are in the presence of a graphene monolayer 89 (see Figure 1.3 \u2013 B). \n\nUnfortunately, the differences in the 2D band between two and few layers of graphene \n\nsheets are not unambiguous in the Raman spectra. Although there are differences in \n\nthe 2D band, the intensity of the G band increases almost linearly as the graphene \n\nthickness increases. This can be readily understood as more carbon atoms are \n\ndetected for multi-layer graphene. Therefore, the intensity of the G band can be used \n\nto determine the number of graphene layers84.  \n\nAs was already said, graphene characteristic bands in the Raman spectrum are \n\ndependent on the substrate (Figure 1.5); however, this effect is not meaningful as was \n\nshown by Ni and co-workers84,90. Single-layer graphene (SLG) sheet was produced on \n\ntransparent (glass and quartz), flexible (PET and PDMS), conductive materials (NiFe \n\nand Si) and also in most widely used substrate SiO2/Si; Raman spectrum of epitaxial \n\ngraphene growth on SiC is also shown. The most important difference is between \n\nRaman spectra of epitaxial graphene growth on SiC and graphene deposited on all the \n\nothers substrates. The first one shows a significant 2D band blueshift which can be \n\nexplained by the strain effect of the substrate. \n\nThe oxidation and exfoliation processes generate changes in graphene Raman \n\nspectrum when compared to graphite (Figure 1.6). Raman spectroscopy is a widely \n\nused tool for the characterization of this type of materials because the conjugated and \n\ndouble carbon\u2013carbon bonds lead to high Raman intensities. Multi-layer graphene \n\n\n\n? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates \n\n \n\n? Page 18 \n\n \n\noxide is the one with more differences from graphite. D and G bands are slightly more \n\nintense. G band is larger, and shows a shift to higher frequencies. This shift has two \n\nreasons: the existence of areas that were not oxidised and the resonance of double \n\nbond at higher frequencies than G band of graphite, being this the main reason for \n\nthe band shift91.  \n\n \nFigure 1.6 \u2013 Evolution of the Raman spectra during the oxidation and exfoliation processes for graphite, \n\nGO, and FGS (few layer graphene sheets). All the spectra correspond to an exciting laser wavelength of \n\n514.5 nm. The position of the G band in graphite is indicated by the vertical dashed line91. \n\nAll the studies about carbon-based materials here presented show the importance of \n\nRaman spectroscopy in structural studies useful to distinguish graphene and \n\ngraphene oxide, mono- or multi-layer.  \n\n \n\n1.4. Carbon nanostructures and SERS \n\n1.4.1. Graphene nanocomposites as SERS substrates \n\n \nFigure 1.7 \u2013 Published Items (TITLE: (graphene) AND TOPIC: (sers), Timespan=All years) in Each Year. \n\nWeb of knowledge, 21-10-2014. \n\n\n\n? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates \n\n? Page 19 \n\n \n\nThe Figure 1.7 shows the growing interest of graphene-based nanocomposites by \n\nresearchers and their effort to improve this nanomaterial as an efficient SERS \n\nsubstrate. \n\nIn 2010, a new material was used as active-SERS substrate: graphene. Ling and co-\n\nworkers9 used graphene to detect popular molecules widely used as a Raman probe: \n\nphthalocyanine (Pc), rhodamine 6G (R6G), protoporphyin IX (PPP), and crystal violet \n\n(CV). Such molecules were deposited equally on graphene and a SiO2/Si substrate \n\nusing vacuum evaporation or solution soaking.  By comparing the Raman signals of \n\nmolecules on monolayer graphene and on a SiO2/Si substrate, it can be observed that \n\nthe intensities of the Raman signals on monolayer graphene are stronger than on \n\nSiO2/Si, indicating a clear Raman enhancement effect on the surface of monolayer \n\ngraphene. In the case of solution soaking, the Raman signals of the molecules are \n\nvisible even though the concentration is low to 10-8 mol dm-3 or less while there is only \n\na fluorescence background from the SiO2/Si substrate. The intensities decrease with \n\nan increase in the number of graphene layers and the signals are not observed on \n\ngraphite and highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). The Raman enhancement \n\nfactors were between 2 and 17 and were calculated by taking the signals on the \n\nSiO2/Si substrate as references, and they were dependent on the symmetry of the \n\nmolecules. This was the first report about the Raman enhancement on the surface of \n\ngraphene and this work was a contribution to the SERS phenomenon explanation \n\nespecially in terms of charge transfer between the analyte and the substrate. \n\nAlthough the positive results with graphene as SERS substrate, the enhancement \n\nfactors were not high enough for practical applications. For that reason, a \n\ncombination of graphene with plasmonic nanoparticles can be foreseen for the design \n\nand fabrication of novel devices with sensing capabilities11.  \n\n \n\n1.4.1.1. Association of metal nanoparticles with graphene \n\nnanostructures \n\nXu et al12 have reported the first study using graphene and silver nanoparticles. In \n\nsuch report, silver-nanoparticle films using graphene oxide sheets as substrates were \n\n\n\n? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates \n\n \n\n? Page 20 \n\n \n\nprepared through the silver-mirror reaction. The enhanced Raman signal of graphene \n\noxide sheets in the composites indicated the SERS activity of such silver particle \n\nfilms, and the degree of enhancement could be controlled by adjusting the density of \n\nthe silver particles. Such SERS-active silver films may hold some advantages as \n\ngeneric SERS substrates for the study of a variety of target molecules, for example, \n\nthe structural and electronic characteristics of graphene oxide sheets. Additionally, \n\nthese studies also indicate the feasibility of using graphene oxide sheets as substrates \n\nfor the preparation of nanoparticle films, including metal, semiconductor, and \n\ninsulating particle films.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. 8 \u2013 Scheme of nucleation and formation of gold nanoparticles on graphene oxide sheet surface11. \n\n \n\nThe first report using graphene and gold nanoparticles as SERS substrate was \n\npublished by Gon\u00e7alves et al11. In this work, was shown that the presence of oxygen \n\nfunctionalities at graphene surface provides reactive sites for the nucleation and \n\ngrowth of gold nanoparticles (Figure 1. 8). Gold nanoparticles are effectively grown at \n\nfunctionalized graphene surfaces using a simple chemical method in aqueous \n\nmedium. The nucleation and growth mechanism depends on the degree of oxygen \n\nfunctionalization at the graphene surface sheets, no gold nanoparticles were obtained \n\nat totally reduced graphene surfaces. Additionally, these studies have shown that the \n\ngraphene/gold nanocomposites act as substrates for surface enhanced Raman \n\nscattering.  \n\nAfter these two major contributions to developing new SERS substrates based on \n\ngraphene and metallic nanoparticles, other publications have shown the potentialities \n\n\n\n? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates \n\n? Page 21 \n\n \n\nof this type of nanocomposites as sensors. Only in the last two years, about 80 papers \n\nwere published on the subject. \n\nGold and silver nanoparticles are the metallic nanoparticles that were used in almost \n\nall the works with graphene and SERS. Also, Ga92, Pd93 and Cu94 were used to \n\ndecorate graphene sheets in order to enhance Raman scattering. The introduction of \n\nGa nanoparticles on graphene sheets allows the study of charge transfer and \n\nplasmonic coupling contribution to the enhancement of Raman modes of graphene. \n\nBesides that, Ga nanoparticles on graphene/SiC show a surface plamon resonance \n\nthat can be tailored from UV to the visible range92. CuGO nanocomposites were \n\nprepared by a reduction in situ using NaBH4 as reducing agent. The copper \n\nnanoparticles on graphene surface produced by this method were distributed \n\nhomogeneously with a controlled size94. The study of the introduction of Pd \n\nnanoparticles on graphene sheets surface was made in comparison to Au \n\nnanoparticles. Fu et al. have shown that Pd nanoparticles have not the plasmonic \n\nproperties to enhance the Raman scattering because as SERS substrate they were \n\nconsiderably weaker than graphene and Au93.  \n\nThe investigation of metal nanoparticles and graphene composites has evolved to \n\nachieve greater enhancement factors. For this, the use of gold and silver nanoparticles \n\nwith shapes different from spherical95 has been greatly explored as well as the \n\ncombination of these two metals in a single composite96. Popcorn-shaped gold \n\nnanoparticles were attached on graphene sheets and this hybrid material was used to \n\ndetect HIV DNA without any labeling. Furthermore, experimental data with this \n\nnovel SERS substrate show excellent reproducibility of the SERS signal97. Gold nano-\n\npyramids were deposited on graphene surface to develop a biocompatible SERS \n\nplatform that enables single molecule detection and provides a reproducible and \n\nuniform response. This shape of gold nanoparticles generates a high density of ?hot \n\nspots? with SERS enhancement factors over 1010. Gold nanoparticles were also tuned \n\nas hexagonal and triangular on graphene by thermally annealing between 600 and \n\n800 \u00baC and their growth is dependent on the number of layers. The platform based on \n\ngraphene and these so-called gold islands exhibit excellent SERS effect on Raman \n\nspectra of few-layer graphene with the enhancement factors up to several hundreds98. \n\nIn Lee work99 it is possible to see that gold nanospheres, nanorods and nanooctahedra \n\n\n\n? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates \n\n \n\n? Page 22 \n\n \n\nassembled on graphene sheets by electrostatic interactions show SERS evidence. In \n\nthis study, nanorods have the highest enhancement factor of the three types of gold \n\nnanocrystals synthesized99. Gold-silver-graphene (Au@Ag-G) composites were \n\nprepared and are SERS-active substrates100,101.  \n\nThe nanocomposites based on graphene and metal nanoparticles are mostly produced \n\nby chemical reduction of both graphene oxide and a metal salt because the chemical \n\nreduction of graphene oxide is easier to obtain in large-scale. Moreover, the oxygen \n\nfunctionalities of graphene oxide allow the nucleation of metal nanoparticles and, \n\nconsequently promote a good dispersion of these nanoparticles on the graphene sheet \n\nsurface11. Some of the chemical reducing agents used are sodium citrate11, ascorbic \n\nacid102, tannic acid103, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)104, and etilenoglycol93. Gum \n\narabic, a natural polymer, was also used to exfoliate graphene sheets and reduce \n\nsilver nitrate into silver nanoparticles105.  \n\n \n\n1.4.1.2. Different structure of SERS substrates based on \n\ngraphene nanocomposites \n\nThe enhancement of Raman scattering may be promoted by a substrate containing \n\nplasmonic nanostructures, originating the SERS effect. As was mentioned in SERS \n\nsub-chapter, lithography is described as the best technique to make the substrates \n\nwith this feature and to have the best results in terms of enhancement factors. \n\nHowever, this technique is expensive and requires specific laboratory equipment. \n\nThere are studies where metal nanoparticles were deposited on a support and \n\ngraphene single-layer was deposited on the top of such nanoparticles. Wang has \n\nshown a hybrid SERS-active platform consisting in a single layer of graphene \n\ncovering quasi-periodic Au nano-pyramid arrays. The hexagonally arranged sharp Au \n\ntips, almost identical in size and topology, support markedly enhanced local fields and \n\nplay a key role in the ultrahigh sensitive system. The tipped substrate can be \n\nfabricated in large scale with superior reproducibility106. Another example of using \n\ndirect imprint is described in the paper of Long107.  Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) \n\nsubstrates were imprinted by using porous anodic alumina (PAA) stamps with \n\nfeaturing periodic hexagonal cells, which were followed by evaporation of gold films. \n\n\n\n? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates \n\n? Page 23 \n\n \n\nThe topography was tuned to optimize the enhancement factor by adjusting the of \n\ngold deposition time. Then a single-layer graphene covered the optimized gold \n\nnanostructures serving as the passivation layer; the final material exhibit significant \n\nSERS enhancement107.  \n\nTo overcome the disadvantages of lithography, some researchers have applied the \n\nfunctionalization of graphene with metal nanoparticles in order to create an active-\n\nSERS substrate with a very good dispersion of plasmonic nanostructures and aligned \n\nspacing interparticle. Chitosan (CS) was used to functionalize the surface of graphene \n\noxide sheets. The negatively charged silver nanoparticles are disposed to form \n\naggregates on GO/CS via electrostatic interaction, which is extremely beneficial to the \n\nSERS detection of aromatic molecules and the final composite remarkably enhance \n\nthe main peaks of l-phenylalanine, in comparison with the silver nanoparticles alone, \n\nshowing great potential for biomedical applications108. In other work, silver \n\nnanoparticles are attached to graphene functionalized with N-(trimethoxysilylpropyl) \n\nethylenediaminetriacetic acid trisodium salt (TETA). With such a substrate, p-\n\naminothiphenol (p-ATP) and melamine were detected with concentration as low as 2 \u00d7 \n\n10?8 and 2 \u00d7 10?7 M by SERS109. A globular protein, ?-lactoglobulin (BLG), was also \n\nused to decorate reduced graphene oxide sheets (RGO) and the obtained BLG-RGO \n\ncomposite that can be dispersed in aqueous solution with pH-sensitive solubility. Due \n\nto the adsorption of ?-Lactoglobulin on the surface of graphene sheets, the BLG-RGO \n\ncomposite was further used as template for Au nanoparticles assembly. These Au \n\nnanoparticles assembled on the BLG-RGO composite were shown to yield a large \n\nSERS enhancement for Rhodamine 6G110. Poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) \n\n(PDDA), a polyelectrolyte, was used to functionalize graphene oxide sheets which \n\nwere decorated with silver nanoparticles. The GO/PDDA/AgNP composite was used \n\nsuccessfully to detect folic acid with ultrahigh sensitivity. In fact, with this substrate \n\nit was possible to detect folic acid in water in a concentration of 9 nmol dm-3 111.  \n\nIn order to develop a specific sensor to detect 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), the surface \n\nof silver nanoparticles were modified with p-aminothiophenol (PATP) and after that \n\nwere supported on graphene sheets. This SERS substrate allows the detection of TNT \n\nwith concentration as low as 10-11 mol dm-3 112. Other example of nanoparticle surface \n\nmodification is the functionalization of gold nanoparticles with 2-mercaptopyridine. \n\n\n\n? 1.

Page 24 \n\n \n\nThese modified nanoparticles were then attached on graphene oxide and reduced \n\ngraphene oxide sheets via ?-? stacking and other molecular interactions113.  \n\nIn most of the examples mentioned the physical structure of the SERS substrate is as \n\ncolloidal suspension or as deposited on some solid support, such as SiO2/Si. Only a few \n\nattempts were made towards fabricating flexible plasmonic devices using such \n\nassembled graphene \u2013 plasmonic particle nanocomposites, despite the fact that \n\ngraphene or graphene oxide can be easily processed into free- standing flexible \n\nsubstrates 12,114. For example, Xu et al.12 demonstrated the fabrication of flexible free-\n\nstanding metal nanoparticle films using a graphene oxide substrate by simply drying \n\nthe concentrated graphene oxide\u2013metal nanoparticle dispersion on a glass substrate. \n\nMore recently, Xu et al.114 reported a new kind of flexible SERS substrates, the so \n\ncalled G-SERS (graphene-mediated SERS) tape by depositing Au nanoparticles on \n\natomically flat graphene by vacuum thermal evaporation. In such SERS tapes, the \n\n??hot spots\u2018\u2018 that are generated in the deposited Au nanostructures by strong LSPR \n\ncoupling through the single layer graphene render the graphene surface a hot surface \n\nfor SERS. They also observed that the SERS signals from G-SERS were cleaner than \n\nthose of pure Au nanoparticles on rigid SiO2 substrates. Such substrates could be used \n\nfor real time analysis of samples and they were even reusable by washing the \n\nsubstrate after the measurement. Other example was shown by Li et al. where a \n\nflexible reduced graphene oxide paper modified with silver nanoparticles was used to \n\ndetect R6G with a concentration of 10-8 mol dm-3. this type of SERS substrate is easy \n\nto process in large scale and also acts as a portable antibacterial substrate115. As these \n\nsubstrates are flexible, they could be useful for the ultrasensitive detection of any \n\ncontaminants on substrates that are not flat. The field of graphene\u2013 plasmonic \n\nnanoparticle composites is relatively new and there is plenty of room for exploring the \n\nlarge scale fabrication of low cost flexible plasmonic sensing devices based on flexible \n\ngraphene\u2013 plasmonic composite substrates7. \n\n \n\n\n\n? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates \n\n? Page 25 \n\n \n\n1.4.1.3. Graphene-surface enhanced Raman scattering \n\n(GERS) \n\nAs was already mentioned, graphene itself show an enhancement in the Raman signal \n\nof some molecules9, phenomenon called by some authors as Graphene Surface-\n\nenhanced Raman scattering \u2013 GERS. But it can be said that the main advantage of \n\nthe use of graphene as SERS substrate is the research about chemical enhancement. \n\nThere are some works which use only graphene, others use graphene and metal \n\nnanoparticles and even others compare graphene to its derivatives in terms of SERS \n\nresults.  \n\nThe enhancement of Raman spectral features of graphene itself was studied using \n\nmetal nanoparticles. The Au nanoparticles improved spectroscopic characterization by \n\nquenching fluorescence, allowing the graphene D and G bands to be quantified, and \n\nyielding a surface enhancement 93,116,117.  Also SERS of graphene was studied using a \n\nmodified Au electrode. In the latter system, both D- and G-band wavenumbers \n\nlinearly depend on the potential applied. The effect was explained in terms of changes \n\nin the C-C bond length induced by electrochemical doping118. Other approach of \n\ngraphene SERS is made with the use of silver nanoparticles. The Ag deposition on \n\ngraphene induced a large enhancement in the Raman signal and caused a shift in the \n\ncharacteristic bands positions 119,120. Other parameter that was also used to \n\ncharacterize graphene by Raman spectroscopy is the ratio of the intensities of D and \n\nG bands (ratio D/G) which increased when graphene was deposited on Ag substrate121.   \n\nGraphene as SERS substrate by itself was firstly shown in the work of Ling et al9. \n\nThe enhancement of Raman peaks of some dyes were compared between graphene \n\nsingle-layer and SiO2 substrates and the results have showed a clear enhancement \n\nwith graphene indicating the Raman enhancement effect on the surface of monolayer \n\ngraphene. With this system, Raman enhancement factors were taking using Raman \n\nintensity ratios. The Raman enhancement factors were quite different for different \n\npeaks, changing from 2 to 17, and can be distinguished through three classes that \n\ncorrespond to the symmetry of the molecular vibrations. This enhancement was \n\nattributed to charge transfer between graphene and the molecules, which result in a \n\nchemical enhancement. After this study there were some others to improve this \n\n\n\n? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates \n\n \n\n? Page 26 \n\n \n\nconcept. The enhancement factors were shown to be dependent of the reduction time \n\nof graphene oxide and SERS spectra of RhB molecules on reduced graphene oxide \n\nreproduced all important spectral fingerprints of the molecule with a negligible \n\nfrequency shift122. Copper phtalocyanine (CuPc), a planar molecule, was used to \n\ninvestigate the effect of molecular orientation on the intensity of chemical \n\nenhancement using graphene as SERS substrate. In this work it was shown that the \n\nstronger the interaction, the more the Raman signal is enhanced, and the analyte-\n\nsubstrate interaction depend on the different molecular orientation of the analyte. \n\nBesides their contribution to understand the chemical enhancement this work has \n\nshown that the magnitude of the chemical enhancement can be used to evaluate the \n\ndegree of interaction between the molecules and graphene123. Other contribution to \n\nchemical enhancement studies was developed by Yaghobian et al., where graphene \n\nsheets are used to enhance Raman signals of 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) with \n\nreproducible enhancement factors124 . R6G was the molecule chosen to study \n\nsystematically charge transfer on graphene, graphene oxide and reduced graphene \n\noxide. Although their structural similarity, the three different substrates have shown \n\ndifferent spectral features due to different enhancement contributions from the local \n\nchemical groups and the global ?-conjugation network of the substrates. The Raman \n\nsignals of R6G were increased with the number of GO layers, while shown inverse \n\ntrend when graphene and reduced graphene oxide were used due to a dominant ?-? \n\nstacking mechanism. The absence of electromagnetic enhancement and the rich \n\nchemical structure makes GO an excellent choice as a tunable substrate in order to \n\nstudy the chemical enhancement resulting from the adsorbent-substrate \n\ninteraction125. \n\nFinally, Sil et al.126 query the existence of SERS phenomenon using graphene. The \n\nwork has shown Raman signals of different analytes adsorbed on carbonaceous \n\nmaterials, such as, chemically reduced graphene, graphene oxide (GO), multi-walled \n\ncarbon nanotube (MWCNT), graphite and activated carbon. The analytes selected for \n\nthe study were Rhodamine 6G (R6G) (in resonant conditions), Rhodamine B (RB), \n\nNile blue (NBA), Crystal Violet (CV) and acetaminophen (paracetamol). All the \n\nanalytes except paracetamol absorb and fluoresce in the visible region. Raman signals \n\nwere due to resonant effect, with fluorescence suppression (in the case of fluorescent \n\nsamples) owing to efficient adsorption on various carbon substrates. The enhanced \n\n\n\n? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates \n\n? Page 27 \n\n \n\nsignals observed at 10-9 mol dm-3 concentrations for R6G are more due to the \n\nresonance effect rather than surface enhancement by the carbon substrates. Using \n\nthis results it was shown that chemically synthesized graphene is ??really\u2018\u2018 not a \n\nunique substrate for observing surface enhanced Raman signals. The results \n\ndescribed, including the data from multiwalled carbon nanotubes, indicate that the \n\npossibility of Graphene induced surface enhanced Raman effect and the fluorescence \n\nquenching effect are open questions126. \n\n \n\n1.4.2. Carbon nanotubes \n\nCarbon nanotube (CNT) is theoretically described as a cylinder fabricated of rolled up \n\ngraphene sheet. It can be divided into a single or multiple walls. Nanotubes with a \n\nsingle wall are, commonly, denoted by single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and \n\nwere first reported in 1993127 while the ones with more than one wall are multi-walled \n\ncarbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and were first discovered in 1991 by Iijima128.  \n\nThese one-dimensional carbon allotropes are of high mechanical strength, rich \n\nelectronic properties, high surface area, excellent chemical and thermal stability129. \n\nSuch properties allow CNT be explored in many research fields: biomedicine (artificial \n\nimplants, tissue engineering, cancer cell identification)130,131, energy132-134, \n\nelectronic135,136  and sensor devices137,138. As in graphene research, also CNT have been \n\nexploited when functionalized with metal nanoparticles. These nanocomposites can be \n\napplied in catalysis, fuel cells or chemo/biosensors139. The last application can be made \n\nby using electrochemical measurements or SERS identification technique140. \n\nIn SERS, the functionalized CNT were used dispersed in solution141, as an endoscope \n\ntip142,143, specifically functionalized for use as an intracellular probe144,145 or vertically \n\naligned in a silicon support146-148. Vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes \n\n(VAMWCNT), or CNT forests, functionalized with gold nanoparticles showed highly \n\nsensitive SERS signals at very low target concentration down to 10 fmol dm-3 due to \n\nthe high-density of gold nanoparticles, in a unit volume, by the densification of \n\nnanotubes149. Moreover, the design of 3D gold covered VAMWCNT SERS substrates \n\non silica supports allows the patterned arrays for multiplex SERS detection148. \n\n\n\n? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates \n\n \n\n? Page 28 \n\n \n\nBesides the advances in SERS detection using VAMWCNT arrays and the good \n\nresults obtained, it still has a long way to optimize and fabricate uniform 3D SERS \n\nsubstrates. \n\n \n\n1.5. Aims of the thesis \n\nBased on the potential of SERS in the detection of biomolecules and the \n\ncharacteristics of carbon nanostructures, the research presented in this thesis was \n\ndirected toward the development of nanostructures that can be a contribution to \n\nactive SERS substrates. \n\nThe approach of getting closer the real world and the research work was one of the \n\nconcerns in this project. The development of SERS substrates that could be used \n\nwithout restrictions and in a practical way in the chemical analysis laboratory was \n\nalways present throughout the work. To this end, also the materials used in the \n\nsynthesis of the nanoparticles, as well as the basis used to support graphene and \n\nnanoparticles were eco-friendly. \n\nThe general objectives of this work are: \n\n1) Development of carbon nanocomposites based on the in situ synthesis of metal \n\nnanoparticles using graphene oxide. Optimize the synthesis procedure testing several \n\nreducing agents.  \n\n2) Evaluation of the performance of graphene nanocomposites in SERS, using several \n\nsupports, a variety of analytes and different Raman setups.  \n\n3) Development of rigid structures that can support well distributed metal \n\nnanoparticles to enhance the Raman signal of molecular analytes. Optimize the \n\nprocess of polymeric membranes synthesis using the freeze-thawing technique and \n\nelectrospinning. Introduce graphene nanocomposites in membranes produced by \n\nelectrospinning in order to contribute for an enhancement of the detection limit of the \n\ntested analytes. \n\n\n\n? 1.

The synthesis in situ of silver \n\nnanoparticles in PVA (Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA) and subsequent crosslinking by freeze-\n\nthawing allows a good distribution of silver nanoparticles through the membranes. \n\nThe drying time of hydrogels, the interaction time between the analyte and substrate, \n\nand the detection limit are parameters that are here evaluated for two different types \n\nof hydrogels of PVA and silver nanoparticles. \n\nBoth types of substrates allow the detection of nucleic acids and DNA in two \n\nconformations (double stranded and single stranded). The positive results obtained \n\nwith Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA for nucleic acids and DNA, after four months of the \n\npreparation of hydrogels, indicate the stability of such SERS substrates. \n\n\n\n? 2.

Introduction \n\nDetection of chemical and biological agents plays a pivotal role in medical, forensic, \n\nagricultural and environmental sciences.1-3 Sensitive methods that allow \n\nidentification of biomarkers such as proteins and nucleic acids at early state disease \n\nprovide the prospect of better health and more effective therapy.4 Technological \n\nplatforms that provide sensors of high sensitivity, selectivity and stability are \n\ntherefore in high demand. In particular, efforts are required for the development of \n\nefficient sensors with the ability to detect analytes in complex biological fluids like \n\nblood, urine, serum, etc.5,6 \n\nSince its discovery in the seventies, SERS (Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering) has \n\nreceived increasing attention from researchers, not only because of its high sensitivity \n\nand the small volume of sample needed, but also due to the possible wide \n\napplicability. 7-9 Compared with normal Raman signals, SERS scattering cross-\n\nsections of molecules residing at or near the surface of roughened or nanostructured \n\nmaterials may be enhanced by factors up to ?1014 or close to that of fluorescence. 10 \n\nThis huge enhancement factor arises from the strong light-induced electric field at \n\nlocations in metallic nanostructured spaces, often called ??hot spots\u2018\u2018, which offer \n\nopportunities to develop ultrasensitive SERS-based biosensors. 2,11 In addition to high \n\nsensitivity, SERS features narrow Raman bands that lead to minimal background and \n\nfavour multiplexing assays. Also, Raman scattering is insensitive to humidity, \n\noxygen, and foreign species that often induce fluorescence quenching, making SERS a \n\nparticularly suitable tool for applications in different environments. Consequently, \n\nSERS is recognized as one of the most promising tools for ultrasensitive chemical and \n\nbiological analysis with the target of attaining the single-molecule level. 2,11,12 \n\nFor SERS, the emphasis to achieve strong enhancement is how to get a good \n\nsubstrate. The development and use of highly reproducible substrates is critical in the \n\nadvance of SERS as a mainstream spectroscopic technique. This is particularly \n\nimportant in studies of large, complex molecules such as DNA or proteins, because the \n\nSERS signal in these molecules also depends significantly on molecular conformation, \n\norientation, and binding specificity to the substrate surface. 13,14 Three major factors \n\ndetermine the quality of SERS substrates: the enhancement factor, the \n\nreproducibility, and the fabrication complexity.15 \n\n\n\n? 2. Ag-Poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer composites as SERS substrates for nucleic acid and DNA detection \n\n \n\n? Page 44 \n\n \n\nAs SERS spectra of molecules adsorbed on metallic nanostructured films are much \n\nmore stable and reproducible when compared with those in metal colloidal \n\nsuspensions, there is much interest in the development of solid SERS substrates with \n\nlarge Raman enhancements and good reproductibility.16,17 Several technologically \n\ndemanding or costly approaches like electron beam lithography or focused ion beam \n\nmilling are applied for fabricating SERS substrates with varieties of nanostructures; \n\nhowever these are too expensive for practical application.18,19 The implementation of \n\nSERS as a widespread analytical tool requires large-scale manufacture of new \n\nsubstrates that, among other features, are inexpensive, easy to implement in diverse \n\nanalytical contexts and of easy processing.20 \n\nPolyvinyl alcohol (PVA) could be considered as a good host material for metal and \n\nsemiconductor nanoparticles, due to good thermo-stability and chemical \n\nresistance.21,22 PVA hydrogels prepared by a physical method, so called freezing-\n\nthawing, are totally discharged from toxicity, have greater mechanical strength and \n\nelasticity than the gels produced by other processes, besides having a high swelling \n\ndegree, and do not need a particular apparatus for its preparation.23,24 \n\nIn the present work we describe the use of PVA as a silver nanoparticles (AgNP) \n\nsupporting solid membrane. AgNP were prepared in situ, in the presence of PVA, by \n\nreaction with two environmental friendly reducing agents: sodium citrate25 and \n\nglucose26. The obtained Ag-PVA composites were characterized by UV-vis \n\nspectrometry and SEM analysis and their ability to be used as active SERS substrates \n\nwas tested first with rhodamine 6G (R6G). A systematic study was developed in order \n\nto optimize the drying conditions of the Ag-PVA composite and the interaction time \n\nbetween the analyte solution and the substrate before SERS detection. The limit of \n\ndetection of the R6G with respect to each substrate was also determined.  \n\nThe optimized Ag-PVA composites were then tested to detect nucleic acid bases \n\n(adenine - A, cytosine - C, guanine - and thymine G - T) and deoxyribonucleic acid \n\n(DNA) in its two conformations (single stranded - ssDNA, and double stranded - \n\ndsDNA) with distinguished sensitivity and uniformity.  \n\n \n\n\n\n? 2.

Characterization of Ag-PVA substrates \n\nAg-PVA hydrogels were prepared by freeze-thawing, a simple technique that produces \n\n3D polymeric networks able to support metallic nanoparticles.27 Here, this \n\nmethodology was applied by exposing an aqueous suspension of PVA and silver \n\nnanoparticles to repeated cycles of freezing at -20 \u00baC and thawing at room \n\ntemperature. This process results in the formation of crystallites, due to the folding of \n\nPVA chains, that serves as physical crosslinks to render the material insoluble in \n\nwater.28 The organization of the PVA molecules is almost random and the areas filled \n\nwith water molecules create a porous structure 29,30 as seen in Figure 2.1. where the \n\nporous microstructure is observed in the PVA composite after lyophylization. This \n\nsimple method is done without need for specific equipment or additional chemical \n\nagents that could influence further SERS results with this substrate such as trace \n\ndetection. \n\nThe Ag-PVA hydrogels were prepared using two different reducing agents for the \n\nsilver ions, sodium citrate (Ag1-PVA) and glucose (Ag2-PVA). Figure 2.1). shows the \n\nSEM images of PVA, Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA immediately after its preparation (indicated \n\nby 0 h) and lyophilization. The SEM image of PVA alone shows a very porous and \n\nreticulated microstructure. The preparation of PVA composites with silver changes the \n\nporous structure of PVA. Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA composites look more compact and \n\nwith a different porous organization as shown in the SEM images (Figure 2.1). The \n\npresence of silver nanoparticles is not very clear in the SEM images, in particular for \n\nAg1-PVA it seems that the silver nanoparticles are imbibed in the PVA structure. \n\n \n\n\n\n? 2.

Page 46 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 \u2013 SEM image of PVA membranes dried by lyophylization \n\n \n\nThe Ag-PVA hydrogels were dried both at room temperature (RT) (for 5, 24, 48 and 72 \n\nh after preparation, respectively) and at 105 \u00baC (for 3h). The aim was to analyze the \n\ninfluence of the presence of water inside the 3D structure of the composites and the \n\nconsequent swelling degree of its PVA matrix, when using the composites as SERS \n\nsubstrates. After drying, the SEM images show clearly the silver nanoparticles at the \n\n\n\n? 2. Ag-Poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer composites as SERS substrates for nucleic acid and DNA detection \n\n? Page 47 \n\n \n\ncomposites surface (Figure 2.2). A porous morphology is also shown for both \n\ncomposites, not regular in porous size or shape. The Ag1-PVA composite shows a \n\nlower amount of Ag nanoparticles than Ag2-PVA, according to the preparation \n\nmethods in which it was used 3.6 and 8.9 mmol Ag+ per g PVA, respectively. The Ag \n\nnanoparticles in Ag1-PVA are smaller than in Ag2-PVA, when the composites were \n\ndried at RT. Drying at 105 \u00baC originates the smallest Ag nanoparticles (Figure 2.2) \n\n In these images it is shown that there are silver nanoparticles at the composites \n\nsurface and possibly they are also at inner layers. Regarding the silver nanoparticles \n\nsize, shape and distribution, the SEM images suggest that the Ag1-PVA composite \n\nhas a lower amount of Ag nanoparticles than Ag2-PVA, being the size and shape of Ag \n\nnanoparticles in Ag1-PVA not so well defined as in Ag2-PVA, where the presence of \n\nAg nanorods together with spherical nanoparticles is observed. Also the presence of \n\nsome nanoparticle agglomerates randomly distributed is observed in both cases. \n\nFurthermore, the presence of silver nanoparticles on the surface of the membranes of \n\nPVA becomes more intense with increasing drying time and drying at 105 \u00b0 C (Figure \n\n2.2). \n\nFigure 2.3 shows that an increase in the drying time at RT, originates an increase in \n\nthe amount of silver particles observed at the composites surface, better noticed in the \n\nSEM images shown of Ag2-PVA, which contains a larger percentage of silver. This \n\neffect is possibly due to shrinking of the PVA matrix while drying. PVA shrinking \n\ncould originate a migration of the Ag particles towards the PVA surface where they \n\ntend to aggregate. The Ag particles aggregation or growth is clear from the increase in \n\nparticle size when comparing the SEM image after 48 h drying with the one after 24 h \n\ndrying at RT (Figure 2.3). After 72 h drying at RT, the SEM images of Ag2-PVA show \n\ntwo distinct regions, one with small spread Ag particles and other with much bigger \n\naggregates, as depicted in Figure 2.3. Drying at 105 \u00baC originates a quicker process, \n\nwith shrinking of the PVA matrix and migration of the Ag nanoparticles to the \n\nsurface, but without growing and aggregation of the Ag particles (SEM images for \n\nboth Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA in Figure 2.2, for Ag2-PVA also in Figure 2.3 for \n\ncomparison purposes). The latter effect is also supported by the SERS results shown \n\nbelow, and will be further discussed, with the composites dried at 105 \u00baC being the \n\nbest SERS substrates. The porous nature of the composites shown in Figure 2.2 and \n\n\n\n? 2. Ag-Poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer composites as SERS substrates for nucleic acid and DNA detection \n\n \n\n? Page 48 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3, makes also possible the presence of Ag particles inside the pores and at \n\nthe inner surface of the material, in particular for Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA dried at \n\n105\u00baC that show the smallest Ag particles (Figure 2.2). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 \u2013 SEM images of PVA membranes Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA dried in air for 48 h or dried in an \n\noven at 105 \u00baC for 3 h.

Page 51 \n\n \n\nThe reflectance spectra of the two substrates dried at different conditions, recorded in \n\na UV-VIS spectrometer in the solid state, are plotted in Figure 2.4. In these spectra \n\ntwo main absorption bands are observed, the PVA band at lower wavelengths (a band \n\nat 274 nm is referred for pure PVA27) and the Ag nanoparticles band at higher \n\nwavelengths (around 400 nm). The minimum of reflectance of the PVA band was \n\nfound to be sensitive to the drying of the matrix presenting a red shift as the polymer \n\nis becoming drier (Figure 2.4). This trend is observed for both substrates, being the \n\nvalues of the minimum of %R detected for higher wavelengths in the case of Ag2-PVA. \n\nThis could be attributed to a lower transparency of the Ag2-PVA caused by a higher \n\ncontent of Ag nanoparticles as may be inferred by the colour of the wet membranes \n\n(insets in Figure 2.4) and also in agreement with SEM analysis (Figure 2.2). With \n\nrespect to Ag nanoparticles peak reflection values, the results differ between Ag1-PVA \n\nand Ag2-PVA substrates. In the Ag1-PVA substrate, the minimum of reflectance \n\nvalues of the band attributed to Ag undergo a slight blue shift with the drying \n\nprocess. For the Ag2-PVA substrate, the minimum reflectance values for Ag are \n\ndetected for lower wavelengths and there is not a defined variation with the drying of \n\nthe substrate. The mean value of 397 nm for the minimum of reflectance is close to \n\nthe reported value of 395 nm observed in pure Ag colloids and is characteristic of the \n\nplasmon resonance absorption for Ag spheres in water31. Though, in the SEM analysis \n\n(Figure 2.2) Ag nanorod structures were also observed. From the literature, rod-\n\nshaped silver may present two main absorption bands: longitudinal plasmon \n\nresonance at ~ 570 nm for smaller length, and a transverse plasmon mode (at ~380 \n\nnm) for higher length, and it is referred that as the length of the nanorods grew with \n\ntime, the longitudinal plasmon resonance essentially disappear32. So, in this case the \n\nobtained spectra probably present the result of the contributions from some isolated \n\nAg spheres together with rods contribution from the transverse plasmon mode. \n\n \n\n2.2.2. SERS results \n\nTo register the SERS spectra, 10 \u00b5L of an aqueous solution of the analyte was added \n\nto a small portion of solid substrate (around 5x5 milimiters) and dried in air at room \n\ntemperature. For comparison purposes, the Raman spectrum of a drop of the analyte \n\nin a glass slide was also recorded, after dried in air at room temperature. In the latter \n\n\n\n? 2.

Page 53 \n\n \n\nThe substrates were tested for SERS just after the drying time was over (or after \n\ncooling down to RT, when it was heated at 105\u00baC), with 10 \u00b5L of a 10-3 mol dm-3 \n\naqueous solution of R6G. The first 7 hours of drying time testing were planned to \n\nconfirm if there was any influence of the substrate water content on the SERS signal \n\nof the analyte. Since during this period there was not a significant effect, longer times \n\nwere used (24, 48 and 72 h) so that the amount of water within the hydrogel could \n\nfurther decrease (the drying process can be followed just by looking at the sample \n\naspect that goes from a wet gel to a dried flat solid). The drying process in an oven at \n\n105\u00baC was performed to assure that no water remained in the hydrogel structure of \n\nthose substrates. The results show that, in fact, the drying time after preparation (or \n\nthe drying temperature) influences the analyte detection by SERS (Figure 2.5).  \n\n \n\n1800 1600 1400 1200 1000 800 600\n\nR\na\n\nm\na\n\nn\n I\n\nn\nte\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\na\n.u\n\n.)\n\nRaman shift (cm\n-1\n\n)\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nd)\n\ne)\n\nf)\n\ng)\n\nh)\n\nA\n\n \n\n1800 1600 1400 1200 1000 800 600\n\nB\n\nR\na\n\nm\na\n\nn\n I\n\nn\nte\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\na\n.u\n\n.)\n\nRaman shift (cm\n-1\n\n)\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nd)\n\ne)\n\nf)\n\ng)\n\nh)\n\n \n\nFigure 2.6 - Raman spectra of Ag1-PVA (A) and Ag2-PVA (B) for several drying times as follows (in \n\nhours): a) 0, b) 3, c) 5, d) 7, e) 24, f) 48, g) 72; and dried at 105 \u00baC (h). \n\n \n\n\n\n? 2.

In the Raman spectra recorded for R6G in the several substrates \n\nobtained during the first seven hours of drying time at room temperature (Figure 2.5 \n\nb-e), the previous pattern was still observed, as obtained without addition of R6G \n\n(Figure 2.5 a and Figure 2.6). After 48 hours drying, only the characteristic SERS \n\nbands of R6G are clearly obtained both in Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA substrates (Figure \n\n2.5 e). For the hydrogels dried at 105\u00baC, a good quality SERS spectrum was also \n\nobtained for R6G (Figure 2.5 f).  \n\n\n\n? 2. Ag-Poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer composites as SERS substrates for nucleic acid and DNA detection \n\n? Page 55 \n\n \n\nFor both composites, if at the beginning of RT drying it seemed that the Ag particles \n\nwere imbibed in the PVA matrix (SEM images in Figure 2.1), and could not be \n\nreached by the analyte, it seems that after 48 h there are plenty of Ag particles \n\navailable that show the right aggregation state to become SERS effective (SEM \n\nimages in Figure 2.2). This is shown by the SEM images and by the Raman spectra \n\nthat start to show the SERS signal of R6G with a drying time of 48 h (that was not \n\nshown at 24h drying). \n\nA completely dried substrate seems to be required to obtain the SERS spectrum of the \n\nanalyte. Before drying the composites, the Ag particles seem to be imbibed in the PVA \n\nmatrix and silver surface may be occupied (originating the Raman signal observed) \n\nand thus cannot be reached the adsorption of by the R6G molecules, which adsorption \n\nis blocked. The initial set of bands for the wet gel (Figure 2.6), similar in Ag1-PVA \n\nand Ag2-PVA, is possibly due to polymer or other retained in contact. SERS spectra \n\nfrom R6G were obtained for both Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA substrates after 48h drying \n\nor dried at 105\u00baC. The substrates used for further testing were those dried at 105\u00baC \n\n(assuring complete dryness) that showed the smallest silver nanoparticles and for \n\nwhich the best SERS signals of R6G were obtained. \n\n \n\n2.2.2.2. Influence of interaction time between analyte and \n\nsubstrate in SERS signal \n\nSince these new Ag-PVA substrates have a three-dimensional porous structure, it is \n\nimportant to assure that there is time for contact between the R6G analyte molecules \n\nand the metal nanoparticles inside the reticulated PVA support, before running the \n\nRaman spectra.  \n\nThe following study aims to evaluate the interaction time between the analyte and \n\nthe substrate that will possibly originate the best SERS signal. R6G (10 \u00b5L of aqueous \n\nR6G 10-3 mol dm-3) was added to Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA substrates, respectively, that \n\nwere previously dried at 105\u00baC.

DNA and nucleic acids detection \n\nThe specific detection of DNA has gained importance in recent years because the \n\nnumber of DNA sequences of different organisms is being determined. Such sequence \n\ninformation can be used for the identification of the genus or species of \n\nmicroorganisms, diseases, or even a single individual. Fast and reliable DNA \n\ndetection is not only used in research and development, it also finds increasing \n\napplications in areas like forensics, food safety control, and agriculture33.  \n\nSERS offers several advantages for the detection of biomolecules: it is a rapid non-\n\ndestrutive tool, it yields compound-specific information, and has the potential for \n\nmulti-component analysis33. But recent advances in the research of DNA \n\nidentification has been made through the use of substrates produced by using complex \n\ntechniques and expensive such as nanolithography, and using DNA chain with a \n\nspecific constitution of oligonucleotides34 or a pre-treatment35,36. Besides, many \n\nexisting DNA discrimination assays exploit the use of a synthetically attached label \n\ngroup that is used to detect hybridization and/or follow DNA denaturation 37-39. This is \n\na common problem with many DNA detection and discrimination assays, where the \n\ntime, difficulty, and expense of synthetically pre-treating a target analyte greatly \n\ndiminish their effectiveness. To this end, there has been a growing interest in ?label-\n\nfree detection?, that is, the detection and discrimination of DNA without the \n\nrequirement to synthetically pre-treat the DNA to be detected prior to analysis40. \n\nAfter testing a standard molecule (R6G) successfully in these new SERS substrates, \n\nin different experimental conditions and with different limit detections, DNA in the \n\n\n\n? 2. Ag-Poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer composites as SERS substrates for nucleic acid and DNA detection \n\n? Page 59 \n\n \n\ntwo conformations (double stranded \u2013 dsDNA and single stranded \u2013 ssDNA) and its \n\nbases (adenine - A, cytosine - C, guanine - G and thymine - T) were applied as analyte. \n\nThis work presents two substrates which identify the DNA into its two conformations, \n\nas well as their constituent bases without any pre-treatment, fluorescent label or \n\ndesign of oligonucleotide chain. The DNA and their bases are used as received by \n\nprovider. In addition, the substrates are produced from a simple technique without \n\nrequiring specific equipment.  \n\nIn general, all DNA bases were detected by both studied substrates. The identification \n\nof the analyte, in this case, depends on its structure and on the substrate used (Figure \n\n2.10). Adenine has two peaks for the Ag2-PVA, one of them well defined, and for Ag1-\n\nPVA has only one peak. Ag1-PVA substrate is a good substrate to identify cytosine \n\nand thymine; on the other hand, with Ag2-PVA was possible identify also these bases \n\nand the guanine. The wavenumber of the main peaks relating to adenine (730 cm-1), \n\ncytosine (795 cm-1), and guanine (650 cm-1) (Figure 2.10; Table 2.2) in observed SERS \n\nspectra are in agreement with the values found in literature41. Regarding thymine, in \n\npublished works it is verified that this is the DNA basis with lower resolution in the \n\nSERS spectrum. Badr et al 42conducted a study of thymine SERS spectrum on the \n\nsilver nanowires surface in which used the 1064 nm laser and the obtained values of \n\nwavenumber are consisted with those found in this study, with two substrates.  \n\nSERS spectra of ssDNA (10-3 mol dm-3) were obtained with both Ag1-PVA and Ag2-\n\nPVA substrates; for dsDNA SERS was obtained with Ag1-PVA only (Figure 2.11).  As \n\nit can be seen in Figure 2.11, the substrate Ag1-PVA allows identification of the basis \n\nconstituents of ssDNA: 733 (A), 970 (C), 1170 (T) and presumably 1279 cm-1 (G). The \n\nvalue assigned to guanine is in agreement with the value found in the SERS spectrum \n\nof this base from the substrate Ag2-PVA. These values are in accordance with the \n\nresults obtained by Green et al43, where analyzes the SERS spectra of oligonucleotides \n\ncomposed only by one of the bases (oligo A, oligo C, oligo G and oligo T).  In the case of \n\nthe Ag2-PVA, the two peaks observed in the spectrum of ssDNA (731, 1320 cm-1) refer \n\nto adenine. Also this is the only base identified when the DNA is in a double helix \n\nconformation and using the Ag1-PVA substrate.  \n\n \n\n\n\n? 2.

Stability of the substrates for nucleobases detection \n\nBesides the reproducibility, the SERS substrates should be stable for a long period of \n\ntime. In this work the stability of the substrates and its reproducibility were tested. \n\nThe same substrates Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA previous described were tested four \n\nmonths after its preparation. The nucleic acids aqueous solutions at 1\u00d710-3 moldm-3 \n\nand DNA (single stranded and double stranded) were the analytes chosen to perform \n\nthese experiments. The analytes solutions were freshly prepared. \n\nGenerally, both SERS substrates remain its activity. All the nucleic acids (adenine, \n\ncytosine, guanine and thymine) were identified (Figure 2.12). In fact, not only the \n\nsame peaks present in Figure 2.10  are present at SERS experiments performed after \n\nfour months but there are some new ones. SERS spectrum of adenine shows the peak \n\nat 731 cm-1 detected by Ag1-PVA substrate and other two: 999 and 1323 cm-1. On the \n\nother hand, in adenine SERS spectrum using Ag2-PVA is very similar to those \n\nacquired four months earlier. The detection of cytosine only have three peaks \n\nregistered in this step of the work; at Ag1-PVA was not detected the peak around \n\n1144 cm-1 and the peak 1026 at Ag2-PVA. The guanine has a peak at around 1000 cm-\n\n1 which is not present in Figure 2.10, when Ag1-PVA was used; the Ag2-PVA was not \n\nable to detect the peaks at 853 and 1352 cm-1. The peak around 1300 cm-1 of thymine \n\nwas not present in the SERS experiments performed four months earlier neither the \n\npeaks present in such SERS experiment was not present in Figure 2.12 (for Ag1-\n\nPVA). In the case of Ag2-PVA, thymine shows two peaks at 900 and 1435 cm-1. \n\n\n\n? 2. Ag-Poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer composites as SERS substrates for nucleic acid and DNA detection \n\n?

Conclusions \n\nPVA hydrogel membranes impregnated with silver nanoparticles were prepared using \n\nthe freeze-thawing process. Two different reducing agents (sodium citrate and \n\nglucose) were used to prepare the Ag nanoparticles. The final materials were \n\ndesignated as Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA, respectively. \n\nThe SERS activity of these membranes was studied using rhodamine 6G as probe \n\nmolecule. The parameters studied, that could affect the SERS activity were: the \n\nmembrane drying time; the time of interaction between the analyte and the \n\nmembrane; and detection limit of the membranes. \n\n\n\n? 2. Ag-Poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer composites as SERS substrates for nucleic acid and DNA detection \n\n? Page 65 \n\n \n\nThe best SERS results were achieved when these polymeric matrix were dried at 105 \n\n\u00baC for 3 hours. The SERS signals could be obtained for long time of interaction with \n\nthe membranes, almost without changes. The probe molecule showed that Ag1-PVA \n\nhad a limit detection of 1\u00d710-5 and Ag2-PVA of 1\u00d710-6 moldm-3 for this analyte.  \n\nThese membranes were demonstrated to be good substrates to detect nucleobases and \n\nDNA in two conformations, single and double-stranded. Although the characteristic \n\npeaks of these analytes were not present in both types of Ag-PVA substrates(Ag1-PVA \n\nperformed better), the adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine were detected in each \n\nsubstrate. The same conclusions can be taken for the cases of ssDNA and dsDNA.  \n\nThe substrates of Ag-PVA showed a good stability for long time. Moreover, the nucleic \n\nacids solutions and DNA were detected four months after preparation of the polymeric \n\nmatrices.  \n\nThe proposed polymeric membranes are promising potential in SERS-based detection \n\nand stable SERS substrates. Furthermore the Ag-PVA membranes are easy to handle, \n\nto prepare, are low cost and environmental eco-friendly.  \n\n \n\n2.4. Experimental Procedure \n\n \n\n2.4.1. Preparation of Ag-PVA hydrogels \n\nHydrogels45 containing 14 wt% PVA were prepared from silver nitrate solutions using \n\ntwo different reduction methods (method 1, sodium citrate reduction;25 method 2, \n\nglucose reduction26).  \n\nMethod 1: 7 g of PVA was added to an aqueous solution of AgNO3 (0.5 mmol dm-3, 50 \n\nmL) and the suspension formed was heated with stirring until it reached 80\u00baC. Then \n\n3.76 mL of sodium citrate 0.085 M was added dropwise and the suspension was kept \n\nstirring at 80\u00baC during 3 hours, after which a clear solution was obtained.  \n\nMethod 2: a solution of AgNO3 (0.01 mol dm-3, 0.0839 g in 50 mL of H2O) was \n\nprepared. D-(+)-glucose (1.2 g) was added to the solution and sonicated for 5 minutes. \n\n\n\n? 2. Ag-Poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer composites as SERS substrates for nucleic acid and DNA detection \n\n \n\n? Page 66 \n\n \n\nAfter, 1 mL of ammonia aqueous solution (25 % weight) was added, followed by 5.6 g \n\nof PVA. The final suspension was heated at 80 \u00baC for 3 hours, with stirring. \n\nFreeze-thawing technique was used to promote crosslink of the polymer. The gel \n\nproduced was distributed in glass containers (\u00b11 g) and submitted to three cycles of \n\nfreeze\u2013thawing (-20\u00baC, +20\u00baC), promoting the cross-linking. After this process was \n\ncomplete, some of the obtained membranes were dried at 105 \u00baC, showing a rigid \n\nstructure like a film, and the other ones were stored at +5\u00ba.  \n\n \n\n2.4.2. Preparation of analyte solutions \n\nAqueous solutions of adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, ssDNA and dsDNA 10-3 mol \n\ndm-3 were prepared. To prepare ssDNA the solution of dsDNA was heated at 90 \u00baC for \n\n20 minutes and cooled in ice immediately after. Both types of DNA solutions were \n\nprepared without using any buffering agent. \n\n \n\n2.4.3. SERS measurements \n\nFor testing both substrates in terms of interaction time and limit of detection we used \n\nR6G solution in different concentrations, and 10 \u00b5L of each solution was placed on the \n\nsurface of the substrates.  For SERS measurements of nucleic acids, also 10 \u00b5L of each \n\nsolution was placed on the membrane and remained in interaction for 72 hours. The \n\nRaman spectra and SERS were recorded using a Bruker RFS100/S FT-Raman \n\nspectrometer (Nd:YAG laser, 1064 nm excitation).  \n\n \n\n2.5. Bibliography \n\n (1) Agasti, S.

Introduction \n\nThe development of simple, ultrasensitive, highly selective and cost-effective \n\nbiosensing platforms is essential for biological assays and clinical diagnostics. \n\nBiosensor platforms used for diagnosis purposes would benefit greatly from the \n\ndevelopment of new graphene-based nanocomposites due to the unique physical and \n\nchemical properties of graphene1-6.  \n\nRecently, numerous graphene-based biosensing platforms have been reported to \n\ndetect different biological molecules on the basis of various mechanisms being the \n\nenhancement of Raman signal one of them7-10. \n\nGraphene, the two-dimensional sheet of sp2-hybridized carbon, shows excellent \n\nelectrical conductivity, high transparency and flexibility. Such particular \n\ncharacteristics has inspired many of the envisage future applications of graphene \n\nsuch as sensor-devices, roll-up and wearable electronics, energy storage materials, \n\npolymer composites, and transparent electrodes11. Because of this plurality of \n\napplications, in the last years, the production of graphene has been a hot topic in the \n\nscientific community. Several methods have been developed such as micromechanical \n\nexfoliation of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)12, chemical vapour \n\ndeposition13,14, epitaxial growth, unzipping of carbon nanotubes by chemical, \n\nelectrochemical or physical methods15-17, each of these methods presenting advantages \n\nand disadvantages. \n\nAlthough, the previously referred methodologies able the production of high quality \n\ngraphene sheets, most of them present the disadvantage of low production rate, high \n\ncost of the process and the need of specific apparatus which are not available in all the \n\nlaboratories18. For these reasons, indirect methodologies to prepare graphene at a \n\nhigher mass production rate, lower cost and without the need of special equipment, \n\nwere explored based on the reduction of graphene oxide (GO). GO is obtained after  \n\nthe exfoliation of graphite powder in the presence of oxidant compounds and strong \n\nacids, following methodologies described by the Brodie19, Staudenmaier20, Hummer21 \n\nor Marcano22. The purpose of the oxidation is to introduce oxygen-containing \n\nfunctional groups into the basal structure of graphene sheets. The oxygen groups are \n\n\n\n? 3. Synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide and its reduction \n\n? Page 74 \n\n \n\nintroduced to reduce the Van der Walls force between the carbon layers within \n\ngraphite, as well as to improve the stabilization of the resulting nano-sheets in water. \n\nThe majority of the methods uses then ultrasonication treatment to enforce the \n\nexfoliation of GO into monolayers. GO can be then reduced to graphene using \n\ndifferent chemical agents23 or thermal treatments24. The basic strategy involve the \n\ncomplete exfoliation of GO into individual GO sheets followed by their in-situ \n\nreduction to produce individual graphene-like sheets.  \n\nHowever, as refereed before, in chapter 1, the quality of the final graphene sheets \n\nobtained from the reduction route of GO is not as high as the quality obtained from \n\nthe physical methodologies, due to some defects that remain in the carbon network \n\nafter the reduction process. That is the reason why these methodologies are avoided to \n\nproduce graphene for applications where the conductive properties of graphene are \n\nessential25. Reduced GO (rGO) is not perfect graphene with lower electricity, because \n\nsmall amounts of functional groups remain in the basal structure and defects (holes) \n\nin the carbon network. \n\nHowever, the intermediary carbon phase, GO, that presents an hydrophilic character \n\ndue to the large number of oxygen-containing functional groups generated during the \n\noxidation process is of great interest, mainly from the chemical point of view, since \n\nthese groups allow the implementation of traditional chemistry methodologies to grow \n\ndifferent organic and inorganic structures at GO surface26,27. This form of graphene \n\nmay develop into the cheap precursor of choice to yield processable graphene in large \n\nquantities. In conclusion, the benefit of GO is its high potential to be the most \n\nversatile starting material for the preparation of functionalized graphene. It was first \n\nshown by Gon\u00e7alves et al10, that the presence of the oxygen-groups at the surface of \n\nGO allows the nucleation and growth of the metallic nanoparticles in the carbon \n\nnetwork. Since the GO surface has a large number of oxygen-containing functional \n\ngroups28, the distribution of the metallic nanoparticles at its surface can be \n\nsuccessfully achieved. This approach is a possibility to prepare the so-called platforms \n\nthat can be tested as SERS substrates because the electromagnetic sites (provided by \n\nthe noble metal nanoparticles) are well distributed on the carbon network, which is a \n\nmajor requirement to obtain a good Raman signal enhancement. However, other \n\n\n\n? 3. Synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide and its reduction \n\n \n\n? Page 75 \n\n \n\napplications for metal nanoparticles dispersed on graphene have already shown \n\nenhanced catalytic activity as well as novel optoelectronic properties29. \n\nIn this work, and for the reasons previously exposed, we have prepared and used GO \n\nto promote the synthesis of gold and silver nanoparticles at its surface. For this \n\npurpose we needed to select a reducing agent to promote simultaneously the reduction \n\nof the metallic ions and of the GO. There are several reducing agents referred in the \n\nliterature23, and our selection was based on the use of eco-friendly reducing agents, \n\nwhenever it was possible. \n\nFollowing these objectives we choose sodium citrate30,31 and D(+)-glucose32,33, which \n\nare the most common ones for gold and silver nanoparticles production. Additionally, \n\nwe used natural sugars and phenolic compounds present in Eucalyptus globulus \n\nLabill bark aqueous extracts to prepare the nanoparticles at GO surface34. \n\nFurthermore, and based on a recent work published by Nergiz S.Z. et al35 we also \n\ntried to prepare gold nanostars at GO surface using in this case, hydroxylamine, as \n\nreducing agent36. Hydroxylamine has a high reduction capability but weak reactivity \n\nwith water and other solvents that make it an appropriate reductant for the GO \n\nreduction in aqueous suspension36. In resume, four different reducing agents were \n\nused to prepare the metal nanoparticles-GO nanocomposites. \n\nIn this chapter we present the results of the preparation and characterization of the \n\nGO used in this work. Initially, we present the morphologic characteristics of the as \n\nprepared GO evaluated by SEM, TEM and AFM. The evaluation of the chemical \n\ncomposition and structure of the same GO is then presented in the following section \n\ntogether with the reduced GO materials by the different chemicals, for a more clear \n\ncomparison. The main idea is to evaluate the capacity of each of the selected \n\nchemicals to reduce the GO nanosheets, that is, to restore the ?-network. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n? 3.

Synthesis and morphological characterization of \n\ngraphene oxide  \n\nGraphene oxide with two-dimensional structure was successfully prepared via the \n\nMarcano\u2018s method22 described in the section 3.4.1. Synthesis of graphene oxide (page \n\n93). \n\nBriefly, we started from graphite flakes (Figure 3.1(a)), the oxidation procedure was \n\napplied and followed by an intensive washing procedure. After a suitable ultrasonic \n\ntreatment, such exfoliation can produce stable dispersions of very thin GO sheets in \n\nwater. The GO product obtained exhibited the traditional brown colour (Figure 3.1(b)). \n\nIt still retains a layered structure, but is much lighter in colour than graphite due to \n\nthe loss of electronic conjugation brought about by the oxidation37.  \n\nThe aqueous GO solutions can be then lyophilized to obtain GO in the dry state, that \n\nis constituted by fluffy powder with a very large volume as exemplified in Figure 3.1(c). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 Photographs of (a) graphite flakes, (b) GO aqueous solution and (c) dried GO by \n\nlyophilisation. \n\nThe morphology and structure of the dried GO nanosheets was investigated by SEM \n\nand TEM. Figure 3.2 presents representative SEM images of free-standing GO \n\nnanosheets with lateral sizes bigger than 3 ?m, revealing a crumpled and rippled \n\nstructure which can result from the drying process. The TEM images obtained are \n\ncharacteristics of single to few layers of graphene sheets (Figure 3.3). The presence of \n\n\n\n? 3.

These well-\n\nexfoliated samples of GO contained no sheets either thicker or thinner than the \n\nreferred value, leading to a conclusion that an efficient exfoliation of GO down to few-\n\n\n\n? 3.

While a pristine \n\ngraphene sheet is atomically flat with a well-known van der Waals thickness of ?0.34 \n\nnm38, GO sheets are expected to be thicker due to the presence of covalently bound \n\noxygen and the displacement of the sp3-hybridized carbon atoms slightly above and \n\nbelow the original graphene plane. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4\u2013 AFM analysis of GO with images of topography and deflection and its profile. \n\n \n\n3.2.2. Chemical reduction of graphene oxide with different \n\nreducing agents and its characterization \n\nThe chemical agents used for the reduction of graphene oxide involved two chemicals \n\ntraditionally used to prepare silver or gold nanoparticles. These were sodium citrate \n\nand glucose. Another two chemical were also used, a natural extract of Eucalyptus \n\nGlobulus prepared by the members of the research team and hydroxylamine, a \n\nchemical with the particularity to promote the growth of gold nanostars, under \n\nparticular chemical medium conditions39. \n\nA representation of the chemical structures of the previous referred molecules is \n\nshown in Figure 3.5. \n\n10.80.60.40.20\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\nX[\u00b5m]\n\nZ\n[n\n\nm\n]\n\nStep = 1.31 nm \n\n1.4\u00b5m\n\n4.00 nm\n\n0.00 nm\n\n\n\n? 3.

UV-vis spectroscopy \n\nThe formation of stable aqueous rGO dispersions enables the reaction process to be \n\nmonitored using UV-vis spectroscopy. According to the literature, GO presents two \n\nUV-vis absorption peaks centered at 230 and 300 nm, which decay gradually with the \n\nincrease of reduction, eventually disappearing depending on the reduction degree40. \n\nMeanwhile, a new absorption peak show up around 264 nm, and red-shifted with the \n\nreduction efficiency, also the absorption in the whole spectral region may increase41, \n\nindicating that the electronic conjugation within the reduced graphene sheets was \n\nrevived upon reduction of graphene oxide42. It can be readily observed that the \n\nreduction causes a change in colour from yellow (GO) to black (rGO) in water. \n\nThe UV-vis spectra of GO and reduced GO with the different chemical reducing \n\nagents is represented in Figure 3.6.  \n\n(a) (b) (c) (d)\n\n\n\n? 3.

Page 80 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.6 \u2013 Absorbance spectra of GO and rGO obtained with sodium citrate, glucose, hydroxylamine \n\nand eucalyptus extracts. \n\nThe UV/Vis spectrum of GO exhibits the two characteristic peaks, a maximum at 230 \n\nnm, which corresponds to ?-?* transitions of aromatic C\u2013C bonds, and a shoulder at \n\n300 nm, which is attributed to n-?* transitions of C=O bonds43,44. The rGO produced \n\nby hydroxylamine, follows the disappearance of the GO peaks with the presence of a \n\nnew peak at 266 nm corresponding to rGO according to literature. The observation of \n\nthe curves corresponding to the GO reduction particullarly with hydroxylamine and \n\n\n\n? 3. Synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide and its reduction \n\n \n\n? Page 81 \n\n \n\nsodium citrate, but also with Eucalyptus extracts shows an increase of absorption in \n\nthe whole spectral region providing a first hint that the GO might be reduced and the \n\naromatic structure might be restored40. Finally the curve corresponding to the GO \n\nreduction by glucose seems to maintain the original GO characteristics peaks (~230 \n\nand 320 nm), together with the appearance of the rGO peak at around 270 nm. Also, \n\nin this case the absorbance of the GO peak at around 230 nm is very high, when \n\ncompared with the others. \n\n \n\n3.2.2.2. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy \n\nThe Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of GO and rGO obtained \n\nwith the different chemical agents are shown in Figure 3.7. \n\nIn all the spectra, we observe a strong and broad absorption peak between 3000 \u20133700 \n\ncm-1 in the high frequency area corresponding to the stretching and bending vibration \n\nof OH groups of water molecules adsorbed on the materials45.  \n\nBased on the literature and specifically starting with GO the attribution of the peaks \n\nis as follows:  the C=O stretching of COOH groups situated at edges of GO sheets are \n\npresent at 1726 cm-1. The absorptions due to the O\u2013H bending vibration, epoxide \n\ngroups and skeletal ring vibrations (sp2-hybrided C=C) are observed in the range of \n\n1500-1600 cm-1 46. The absorption at 1393 cm-1 may be attributed to tertiary C\u2013OH \n\ngroups. The C-O stretch from epoxy groups is responsible for a peak at 1232 cm-1 and \n\nfinally, the alkoxy C-O stretch is visible at 1060 cm-1 47,48. \n\n\n\n? 3. Synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide and its reduction \n\n? Page 82 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7 \u2013 FTIR spectra of GO and rGO reduced with the different chemical reducing agents.  \n\nWith the reduction methodologies applied to GO, it was expected that the intensity of \n\npeaks associated to the oxygen functional groups would significantly diminish or even \n\ndisappear, concomitantly with the restoration of the sp2-hybrided C=C. However, as \n\ncan be observed in Figure 3.7, the oxygen functional groups are still present, being \n\ndifficult to conclude if there is a reduction of oxygen presence or not based on these \n\nspectra. Yet, the rGO produced from hydroxylamine treatment shows the most visible \n\ndifferences. A strong peak is visible at 1568 cm-1, this can be attributed to C=C \n\nstretching vibration, the other broad peak centred at 1200 cm-1 is possibly the sum of \n\nthe contributions from remaining C-O from epoxy and alcoxy groups. \n\nThe FTIR spectrum of rGO_glucose shows more peaks than those attributed to GO \n\nstructure. Such presence of these peaks can be explain by the adsorption of glucose at \n\nthe surface of GO.  \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n? 3. Synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide and its reduction \n\n \n\n? Page 83 \n\n \n\n3.2.2.3. Thermogravimetric analysis \n\nThe decomposition profiles of these samples could be understood as consequences of \n\nthe different oxidation states of the carbon structures. The thermogravimetric (TG) \n\nand the corresponding differential TG (DTG) curves of the samples obtained under \n\nnitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 \u00baC min-1 are shown in Figure 3.8 and Figure \n\n3.9, respectively.  \n\nAll the samples show a slight mass decrease from room temperature to 100 \u00b0C \n\nattributed to adsorbed water. In the case of GO, a significant decrease from 150 \u00b0C to \n\n200 \u00b0C caused by pyrolysis of the oxygen-containing functional groups, generating CO, \n\nCO2 and stream is observed. The mass of GO slowly further decreased up to 620 \u00b0C \n\nalong with burning of GO by dehydration of carboxyl and epoxide groups. The \n\ntemperature at which the decomposition of carbon sheets takes place is related to the \n\nintegrity of the sp2 system. Since GO has a broken sp2 system, the thermal stability of \n\ncarbon sheets is poor and GO decomposes totally at a quite low temperature with \n\nlittle residual graphene49. \n\nAfter the reduction treatment of GO with the different chemical agents, the removal \n\nof the thermally labile oxygen functional groups by chemical reduction results in \n\nmuch increased thermal stability for the reduced GO. It is expected that the system, \n\npartially or totally recovers the integrity of the sp2 system, depending on the \n\nreduction method. This fact should lead to restoring the additional thermal stability. \n\nRegarding the reduction with sodium citrate, there is an initial mass decrease at \n\naround 100 \u00baC due to water adsorption. The mass loss at 300 \u00baC corresponding to a \n\nvery sharp DTG peak seems to be attributed to the loss of adsorbed citrate ions50 at \n\nrGO surface. Small mass decrease peaks are observed that when compared with the \n\ninitial GO material corresponds to a much lower presence of oxygen-containing \n\nfunctional groups, indicating a high reduction degree. The thermal stability of this \n\nmaterial is much higher than GO, indicating a good level of reduction. \n\n \n\n\n\n? 3. Synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide and its reduction \n\n?

The initial two mass loss peaks corresponding to water \n\nand oxygen functional groups presents a displacement to higher temperatures when \n\n\n\n? 3. Synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide and its reduction \n\n \n\n? Page 85 \n\n \n\ncompared to GO, this may indicate that some glucose molecules are adsorbed at rGO \n\nsurface. This appears to be confirmed by a decomposition phase around 300 \u00baC which \n\nmatches the temperature of thermal depolymerization of the polysaccharide51.  \n\nThe TG and DTG curves of the GO reduced by the Eucalyptus extracts follow the GO \n\nthermal behaviour with some small mass peak loss deviations. However, the total \n\namount of labile oxygen functional groups is considerable lower in the reduced form. \n\nThe reduction with hydroxylamine shows the most thermally stable rGO, suggesting \n\nthat a significant amount of the water and labile oxygen groups were removed by the \n\nhydroxylamine reduction. \n\n \n\n3.2.2.4. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy \n\nX-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted to elucidate the \n\nevolution of oxygen groups and confirm their degree of removal upon reduction \n\ntreatment, also to determine the nature of the residual oxygen containing functional \n\ngroups that remain after reduction and to clarify how the reduction treatment affects \n\nthe electronic structure of GO. \n\nThe typical C 1s spectra of the samples surface under study are represented in \n\nFigures 3.10 and 3.11, also the deconvolutions of the C 1s spectra are represented in \n\nthese figures. The relative concentrations of surface functional groups obtained from \n\nthe deconvolution of the C1s XPS regions are summarized in the Table 3.1. The \n\nattribution of the chemical groups to the peak positions was done according to the \n\nliterature28,52,53.  \n\nThe deconvolution of the C 1s XPS spectrum of the GO sample (Figure 3.10) show the \n\npresence of three different types of carbon bonds, with peaks centred at 285.0, 287.0 \n\nand 288.6 eV, corresponding to C=C/C\u2013C, C\u2013O/C-OH, and C=O/COOH groups, \n\nrespectively53. From the Table 3.1, the determined ratio C/O is 0.7 which allows to \n\nverify the predominance of the carbon atoms in the oxidized state. \n\n \n\n\n\n? 3.

Synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide and its reduction \n\n \n\n? Page 87 \n\n \n\nThe rGO_SC exhibits a significant decrease of the peak intensity for the C-O/C-OH \n\n(from 49.4 at% in GO to 17.9 at% in rGO_SC), an increase of the peak intensity for the \n\nC=C/C\u2013C (from 40.7 at% in GO to 69.1 at% in rGO_SC), and an increase of the C/O \n\nratio (0.7 to 2.2 (Table 3.1)) which is indicative of GO reduction. However, there was an \n\nincrease of the C=O band at 288.3 eV (from 9.9 at% in GO to 13.1 at% in rGO_SC) \n\nwhich derives from sodium citrate absorption on the surface of rGO, in good \n\nagreement with TG results. \n\nWith respect to rGO_HDA, the ratio C/O of 4.4 clearly indicates the higher \n\ndeoxygenation of the initial GO (Table 3.1). In the case of rGO_HDA is possible \n\nidentify separately the groups C=C and C-C (Figure 3.10). An increase of the quantity of  \n\nC=C and C\u2013C (from 40.7 at% in GO to 76.5 at% in rGO_HDA) is observed together \n\nwith a decrease of the oxygen groups (C-O/C-OH from 49.4 at% in GO to 18.7 at% in \n\nrGO_HDA and the disappearance of C=O/COOH in rGO_HDA). It should also be \n\nnoted that a new peak emerges at 286.3 eV corresponding to the C-N bonding \n\nresultant from the functionalization of GO surface by hydroxylamine chemical \n\ntreatment53.  \n\nIn the case of rGO_EE sample an increase in the intensity of the peak attributed to C-\n\nC/C=C bonds at 285 eV is observed (Figure 3.10). However the ratio C/O has the same \n\nvalue (0.7) as the GO sample. Moreover, rGO_EE shows an increased peak intensity \n\nfor the C-O/C-OH band at 286.6 eV (from 49.4 at% in GO to 55.6 at% in rGO_EE) and \n\na decreased intensity for the C=O band at 289 eV (from 9.9 at% in GO to 4 at% in \n\nrGO_EE). This can be explained by the possible interactions of EE molecules with GO \n\nstructure. The EE are composed by several types of sugars and phenolic compounds34, \n\nwhat difficult the identification of the possible interactions. In the same way, the \n\nsample rGO_glucose didn\u2018t allow obtaining credible XPS data. The curves are shown \n\nin Figure 3.11, however as can be observed, in this case there is an increase of the \n\noxygen functional groups, what does not correspond to a reduction reaction. The \n\nexplanation for this fact can be, once more, related with the interaction of glucose \n\nwith GO surface.  \n\n\n\n? 3. Synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide and its reduction \n\n? Page 88 \n\n \n\n3.2.2.5. Raman spectroscopy \n\nThe reduction of GO may be evaluated by the D/G peaks intensity ratio of the Raman \n\nspectra. The variation of the relative intensities of G band to D band in Raman \n\nspectra of GO during reduction usually reveals the change of electronic conjugation \n\nstate. This change suggests an increase in the number of sp2 domains with the \n\nreduction of GO54. \n\nTo analyse the best performance of the reducing agents in reduction of GO, we \n\nanalysed the D and G bands of the Raman spectra. For such analysis, previously was \n\nmade the normalization of GO, rGO_SC, rGO_EE, rGO_G and rGO_HDA regarding \n\nthe maximum of G peak. After that the fit of each band was made according to the \n\ntype of curve. The function more appropriate to fit D band is the Lorentzian and to fit \n\nG band is the Breit-Wigner-Fano (BWF), since G band is an asymmetric curve caused \n\nby its resonant dispersion55.  \n\nThe ratio ID/IG is the most commonly used parameter to identify the reduction degree \n\nof GO, however recently another parameter was introduced which can also be helpful \n\nfor this evaluation: the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of D peak55. The G \n\npeak has a complex origin that produces an asymmetric curve which is difficult to fit \n\nwhereas D peaks fit the Lorentzian shape well. For that reason, the FWHM of (D) was \n\nchosen as new parameter to assess the reduction degree, as mentioned above.  \n\nThe Raman spectra presented in this chapter were obtained using the lasers of 488 \n\nnm and 1064 nm (Figure 3.12 and Figure 3.13, respectively). The latter is not widely used \n\nto characterize graphitic materials; however this was the one most available for the \n\npresent thesis work.  \n\nThe Figure 3.12 show the two parameters ID/IG and FWHM (D) as a function of FWHM \n\n(G). The positions of the G bands are also inserted as function of two parameters \n\nchosen. The values of FWHM (G), obtained with Raman curves from the compounds \n\nanalysed with Raman laser of 1064 nm, decrease as ID/IG increases by the following \n\norder: GO, rGO_SC, rGO, EE, rGO_G and rGO_HDA (Table 3.2).

Page 92 \n\n \n\nThe Figure 3.14 shows the mapping (25 spectrum of each sample; the acquisition \n\npoints are 40 \u00b5m from each other) and ?Raman images? obtained from GO, rGO_SC, \n\nrGO_EE, rGO_G and rGO_HDA.  \n\nThe homogeneity of the reduced samples can be observed by mapping images. The \n\nchanges of the colour in the graphics show the changes in ID/IG. The image mapping of \n\nGO, rGO_EE and rGO_HDA are the most homogeneous. Besides, the mapping of \n\nrGO_SC shows a great change of colours its statistic values of ID/IG is similar to the \n\nresults obtained after the fitting of D and G bands. In the case of rGO_G, the 25 \n\nspectra were not acquired due to the inhomogeneity of the film. However, the results \n\nobtained with the possible spectra revealed a statistic value of ID/IG , once again, close \n\nto the obtained with Lorentzian and BWF fitting of D and G peaks.  \n\nFrom the present analysis and based on these parameters, it is possible see that the \n\nhigher rGO was obtained with glucose and hydroxylamine. \n\n \n\n3.3. Conclusion \n\nGraphene oxide was produced showing a good exfoliation (~1.3 nm of sheet thickness), \n\na lateral size bigger than 3 \u00b5m and the oxygen-functional groups were confirmed by \n\nFTIR spectrum.  \n\nHydroxylamine proved to be the most effective reducing agent of the set of chemical \n\nagents selected to reduce GO. This conclusion was confirmed by all characterization \n\ntechniques (UV-vis, FTIR, TGA, XPS and Raman). Raman and UV-vis spectra showed \n\nthat glucose seems the second more effective chemical agent to reduce GO; however \n\nthis sugar was adsorbed at the surface of GO sheets as was seen in the results \n\nobtained by the techniques of FTIR, TGA and XPS.  \n\nIn the case of the sodium citrate and eucalyptus extracts, the Raman analysis was not \n\nclear in what was the best to restore sp2 C network whereas X-ray Photoelectron \n\nSpectroscopy results showed that sodium citrate was more efficient. However, the \n\neucalyptus extracts show the same behaviour as glucose and was adsorbed at GO \n\nsurface as was seen in FTIR spectra.  \n\n\n\n? 3. Synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide and its reduction \n\n \n\n? Page 93 \n\n \n\nWith the previous results it is possible to highlight the good quality of GO produced at \n\nthe laboratory and conclude that the reducing agents used showed different efficiency \n\nin restoring the sp2 carbon network of GO. Not all the oxygen functional groups were \n\nremoved using these chemicals, under the experimental conditions used, and some of \n\nthe chemicals were adsorbed at the final rGO material. \n\n \n\n3.4. Experimental procedure \n\n3.4.1. Synthesis of graphene oxide \n\nGO was prepared by Marcano\u2018s method22. Briefly, 360 mL of H2SO4 were added to a \n\nmixture of 3 g of graphite flakes and 18 g of KMnO4. 40 mL of H3PO4 were added to \n\nprevious mixture very slowly. After 24 hours with stirring, the high viscous \n\nsuspension formed was carefully added to ice. Then 10 mL of H2O2 were added and \n\nthe suspension was heated to 50 \u00baC, 4 hours and after that was in sonication 1 hour. \n\nThe product obtained was filtered several times and washed with deionized water. In \n\norder to obtain a GO suspension with pH 6 \u2013 7, the filtered suspension was submitted \n\nto dialysis. \n\n \n\n3.4.2. Reduction of graphene oxide \n\nrGO_sodium citrate. A suspension of 0.15 mg/mL of GO (50 mL) was heated until \n\n80 \u00baC, after 1.880 mL of sodium citrate (0.085 mol dm-3) was added dropwise. The \n\nexperimental conditions were maintained during 1 hour.  \n\nrGO_glucose. 1.2 g of D-(+)glucose was dissolved into 40 mL of a suspension of GO \n\n(0.75 mg/mL). The mixture was in sonication about 5 min. Then, 1 mL of ammonia \n\n(25%) was added and the final suspension was again in sonication, during 5 min.  \n\nrGO_eucalyptus extract. 70.75 mg of eucalyptus extract was added to a suspension \n\nof GO (0.50 mg/mL, 100 mL). The mixture was stirring for several minutes.  \n\n\n\n? 3. Synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide and its reduction \n\n?

Introduction \n\nRecently, graphene has been shown to have a clear Raman enhancing effect, related \n\nto its unique flexible and smooth 2D honeycomb structure with a one-atom thickness1-\n\n4. By decorating graphene nanosheets with silver nanoparticles a significantly \n\nenhanced Raman signal of graphene was found by Xu et al.5 Additionally, \n\ncombination of these two materials can also be used to detect molecules at very low \n\nconcentrations6. Among known strategies for generating graphene-based \n\nnanomaterials, starting from graphene oxide is the most versatile and easily scalable \n\nmethod. Graphene oxide has a single or few layers of carbon structured nanosheets \n\nstrongly oxygenated which are able to nucleate the metal nanoparticles5,7. Silver and \n\ngold nanoparticles display plasmon excitation in the visible spectrum, are very easy to \n\nprepare8-10 and their incorporation in several nanocomposites is well-known11-13.  \n\nCombining the characteristics of graphene with those of silver or gold nanoparticles, \n\nthe resultant nanomaterial can act as a SERS substrate. There are several reducing \n\nagents that have been used to synthesize graphene-based nanocomposites. Hydrazine \n\nis one of the most common and effective reducing agent for the reduction of graphene \n\noxide but due to its toxicity and environmental protection measures, nowadays \n\nresearchers are trying to replace it by eco-friendly reducing agents14. In this work, \n\nthis was one of the concerns for the preparation of the metal nanoparticles-graphene \n\noxide (MGO) nanocomposites and the reducing agents chosen were: sodium citrate, \n\nglucose and eucalyptus extracts. Sodium citrate have been already used in our \n\nresearch group to synthesize gold-graphene nanocomposites which have shown SERS \n\nactivity7. Glucose is a well-known reducing agent used in the formation of MGO \n\nnanocomposites15,16. The extract of eucalyptus was also recently reported by our group \n\nas a reducing agent17 and used to prepare MGO nanocomposites.  \n\n \n\n4.2. Results and Discussion \n\nThe nomenclature adopted to identify the MGO nanocomposites prepared with the \n\ndifferent chemical agents was the following: MGO_sodium citrate, MGO_glucose and \n\n\n\n? 4. AgGO and AuGO nanocomposites as SERS substrates \n\n? Page 102 \n\n \n\nMGO_eucalyptus extract (M = Ag or Au), in some cases it will be used to abbreviate \n\nMGO_SC, MGO_G and MGO_EE, respectively. In the case of gold nanocomposites \n\nhydroxylamine was also used as reducing agent18 (AuGO_hydroxylamine or \n\nAuGO_HDA). The previous nanocomposites were evaluated for its capacity as SERS \n\nsubstrates in varied conditions. \n\n \n\n4.2.1. Characterization of AgGO and AuGO \n\nnanocomposites \n\nThe AgGO and AuGO nanocomposites were synthesized according to the experimental \n\nprocedure described in section 4.4. The reducing agents used were sodium citrate, \n\nglucose and eucalyptus extract (Scheme 4.1); in the case of AuGO hydroxylamine, \n\nNH2OH, was also used. \n\n   \n\n   citrate         glucose eucalyptus extract \n\nScheme 4.1 \u2013 Reducing agents used for the in situ synthesis of MGO nanocomposites. \n\n \n\nThe presence of oxygen-groups in the surface of GO allows the nucleation of metallic \n\nnanoparticles7. In the GO surface, due to the large number of oxygen-containing \n\nfunctional groups, the distribution of metal nanoparticles can be successfully done \n\n(Scheme 4.1). This approach is a possibility to obtain platforms that can be used as \n\nSERS substrates because the electromagnetic sites are well distributed almost \n\n?ordered?, which is a requirement to obtain a good Raman signal enhancement19. The \n\nreduction process will affect both the metal ions, originating the metal nanoparticles, \n\n\n\n? 4. AgGO and AuGO nanocomposites as SERS substrates \n\n \n\n? Page 103 \n\n \n\nand the graphene oxide that will be converted to reduced graphene oxide (Scheme \n\n4.2). \n\n \n\nScheme 4.2 \u2013 In situ synthesis of silver or gold nanoparticles in the presence of graphene oxide. \n\n \n\n \n\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) and UV-vis absorption were used to characterize \n\nthe as-prepared graphene-based nanocomposites (Figure 4.1 and 4.2). UV-vis spectra \n\nof the metal colloids obtained with the same reducing agents but in the absence of \n\nGO, and of GO itself were also recorded. Observing the SEM images it is possible to \n\nsee the differences in the nanoparticles size depending on the reducing agent used. \n\nThe reduced graphene oxide present in the metal nanocomposites continues to show \n\ntransparency and the characteristic wrinkles which means that GO keeps its well \n\nexfoliated structure even after the composites preparation. In Figure 4.1, the silver \n\nnanoparticles grown in AgGO_sodium citrate and AgGO_eucalyptus extract show a \n\nvery similar size, between 40 and 60 nm. This is confirmed by the UV-vis spectra of \n\nboth nanocomposites and is according to previous results reported17. Using glucose as \n\nthe reducing agent, the silver nanoparticles (AgNP) obtained are bigger than the \n\nAgNP obtained with the other two methods. The AgGO_glucose nanocomposites show \n\nAgNP with 100-200 nm of diameter. Such size differences will influence the SERS \n\nsignals obtained using these composites as substrates, as will be shown later in this \n\nthesis.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n? 4.

Page 106 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn Figure 4.2, the UV-vis results indicate that when sodium citrate was used the gold \n\nnanoparticles should be quite similar in size to those produced with eucalyptus \n\nextract. However, in the SEM images, the gold nanoparticles present in the \n\nAuGO_sodium citrate nanocomposite are larger. The reduction with hydroxylamine \n\noriginates gold nanoparticles with a star shape that cannot be observed in the SEM of \n\nAuGO_HDA, but is clearly shown in the SEM image of the gold colloid obtained by \n\nreduction with hydroxylamine (Figure 4.3). The ?max in the UV-vis of  the latter colloid \n\nis near 600 nm which is in agreement with the literature18. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 \u2013 SEM image of the star shaped nanoparticles in the gold colloid obtained by reduction with \n\nhydroxylamine. \n\n \n\n4.2.2. SERS studies  \n\n4.2.2.1. SERS of graphene in AgGO and AuGO \n\nnanocomposites \n\nThe typical Raman bands D and G of graphene can be enhanced in the presence of \n\nmetal nanoparticles. As mentioned in the introduction section of this chapter, Xu et \n\nal.5 have demonstrated that by introducing AgNPs on reduced graphene oxide film \n\nthere was an enhancement in the graphene Raman bands. \n\n\n\n? 4. AgGO and AuGO nanocomposites as SERS substrates \n\n \n\n? Page 107 \n\n \n\nHere, we have studied the influence of growing metal nanoparticles at a GO surface, \n\nprepared by reduction with sodium citrate, glucose, eucalyptus extract and \n\nhydroxylamine, respectively, in the Raman spectra of the composites. For such \n\nanalysis, the Raman laser of 488 nm was used. In Figure 4.4, each reducing agent are \n\nshown the Raman spectra of the initial GO (without reduction), rGO obtained with \n\nthis agent, and the respective MGO composite. \n\nThe Raman spectrum of GO displayed the characteristic prominent D band around \n\n1365 cm-1 and G band around 1595 cm-1 20. The Raman spectra of the AgGO \n\nnanocomposites showed a clear enhancement of the main typical bands of graphene, \n\nD, G and 2D, independently of the preparation method (Figure 4.4). The enhancement \n\nof the Raman bands of graphene observed in the composites is due to a SERS effect \n\noriginated by the metal nanoparticles present. \n\nThe ID/IG ratio increases in rGO and AgGO when compared with GO, with the use of \n\nthe three reducing agents (Figure 4.4). According to literature6 this change suggested \n\nthe decrease in the average size of the sp2 domains, but more numerous in numbers \n\nupon reduction of the exfoliated GO. The exception occurs to AgGO_EE where the \n\nID/IG decreases from 0.92 of GO to 0.90, which means that the reduction of oxygen \n\ngroups of GO using eucalyptus extract in the presence of silver is smaller than using \n\nthe other reducing agents. It is also important to refer that, in the three cases studied, \n\nthe ID/IG ratio slightly decreases from the rGO to AgGO nanocomposites, this could be \n\nprobably related with the presence of the AgNPs that disrupt the sp2 domains. \n\nIt is referred that the Raman signals of graphene enhanced by silver nanoparticles, \n\nmainly arise from the SERS EM effect 4. However, the enhancement of the Raman \n\nsignals of the three AgGO nanocomposites varied significantly, which can be seen by \n\nthe results obtained from ID (AgGO)/ID (GO) and IG (AgGO)/IG (GO) (Figure 4.6). \n\n\n\n? 4.

Also the comparison was made related with IG (reduced sample)/IG (GO). \n\nIn the case of AuGO nanocomposites (Figure 4.7), only the nanoparticles of gold \n\nsynthesized with hydroxylamine increase the intensity of D and G bands of the \n\ngraphene matrix. \n\n\n\n? 4.

AgGO and AuGO nanocomposites as SERS substrates \n\n \n\n? Page 111 \n\n \n\nLikewise the ID/IG increases in reduced GO, also the ID/IG in the presence of gold \n\nnanoparticles increases with the use of the four reducing agents (Figure 4.8). This \n\nchange suggested the decrease in the average size of the sp2 domains, but more \n\nnumerous upon reduction of the GO6. The reduction of hydroxylamine is noticeable \n\nwith ID/IG of 2.9. \n\nIt is well-known that the Raman signals of graphene can be enhanced by gold \n\nnanoparticles, which mainly arise from the SERS EM effect. However, in this case, \n\nthe intensification of Raman signals were not noticeable (Figure 4.9). In the case of \n\nAuGO_glucose, the ratios ID (nanocomposite)/ ID (GO) and IG (nanocomposite)/ IG (GO) \n\nshow a decrease of Raman intensities of D and G bands. All the other composites have \n\na slightly enhancement of such bands. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8 \u2013 Ratio ID/IG of GO and rGO and AuGO nanocomposites prepared by using sodium citrate, \n\nglucose, eucalyptus extracts and hydroxylamine. \n\n \n\n\n\n? 4.

SERS substrates with AgGO and AuGO \n\nnanocomposites \n\nAlthough the AgGO and AuGO nanocomposites, with the potential SERS activity, \n\nwere characterized in suspension (as produced), the fabrication of SERS active \n\nsubstrates with easy to handle properties at low cost was one objective. One way to \n\nachieve this purpose is to support these suspensions by spreading in an adequate and \n\neasily to handle material. To support the nanocomposites suspensions we chose \n\nmaterials that were already available in the laboratory (filter paper and glass slides) \n\nor that were easy to produce (PVA membranes). These supports present different \n\nroughness which is one of the materials characteristics that can influence the SERS \n\nactivity itself. \n\nThe MGO_sodium citrate and MGO_glucose (M = Ag and Au) were the selected \n\nnanocomposites and the laser used was the 1064 nm. For this study, thiosalicylic acid \n\n(SHsal) was the analyte chosen to test the SERS activity. The silver and gold \n\n\n\n? 4. AgGO and AuGO nanocomposites as SERS substrates \n\n \n\n? Page 113 \n\n \n\nnanocomposites were tested in suspension or deposited in glass slides, filter paper and \n\nin PVA membranes (Figures 4.11 to 4.14). \n\nTo test the homogeneity of the substrate the AgGO nanocomposite was chosen, a \n\nSERS mapping of 25 regions of AgGO_sodium citrate with SHsal 1\u00d710-3 mol dm-3 \n\ndeposited on a glass slide was made. This type of mapping was recorded using a laser \n\nof 488 nm. Observing the spectra in Figure 4.10 it is possible to see the homogeneity \n\nof the SERS activity in the several points of the substrate area tested. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.10 \u2013 Raman spectra from 25 spots of a glass slide in which it was deposited SHsal in \n\nAgGO_sodium citrate. \n\n \n\nIn the following Figures 4.11 to 4.14 the spectra on the left correspond to substrates \n\nreduced with sodium citrate, and the spectra on the right correspond to substrates \n\nreduced with glucose (as stated on the top).

A clear SERS spectrum of SHsal was obtained in the \n\nsubstrates of AgGO_sodium citrate both in suspension and supported in filter paper. \n\nIn the case of AgGO_glucose, the composite originated the SERS bands of SHsal in all \n\nconditions (suspension and supported in glass slides, filter paper and PVA \n\nmembranes).

The \n\nexperiments with the nanocomposite AgGO_glucose also show the SERS bands of \n\ngraphene, together with the bands of SHsal when the analyte was added. \n\nAgGO_glucose deposited on glass slides was the support that showed the best \n\nperformance for the detection of SHsal molecules with more intense bands than in the \n\nother supports. \n\nFigure 4.13 and Figure 4.14 show a comparative study of the AuGO nanocomposites and \n\nAu colloids (obtained under the same reduction conditions), as SERS substrates in the \n\ndetection of SHsal. A clear SERS spectrum of SHsal was obtained in the substrates of \n\nAuGO_sodium citrate both in suspension and supported in glass slides and in filter \n\npaper. In the case of AuGO_glucose, the composite originated the SERS bands of \n\nSHsal in suspension and supported in PVA membranes. Au_glucose deposited in PVA \n\nmembranes was the only substrate of gold nanoparticles only, without graphene, to \n\noriginate the SERS of SHsal. The experiments with the nanocomposite AuGO_glucose \n\nalso show the SERS bands of graphene, together with the bands of SHsal when the \n\nanalyte was detected. AuGO_glucose deposited on PVA membranes was the support \n\nthat showed the best performance for the detection of SHsal molecules. \n\nSimilar studies with the nanocomposites MGO_eucalyptus extract (M = Ag or Au) and \n\nAuGO_hydroxylamine, did not show a SERS signal for SHsal.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n? 4.

Conclusion \n\nThe environmental eco-friendly reducing agents, sodium citrate, glucose and \n\neucalyptus extract, can be used to prepare nanocomposites of graphene and silver or \n\ngold nanoparticles. Glucose was the reducing agent that originated the biggest \n\nnanoparticles (around 100 nm) in the case of silver. \n\nUsing the laser of 1064 nm and for detection of SHsal ethanolic solution, both AgGO \n\nand AuGO nanocomposites were active as SERS substrates. The best substrates for \n\nSERS, with SHsal as analyte, were AgGO_glucose deposited on glass slides and \n\nAuGO_glucose deposited on PVA membranes; with better performance than the \n\ncorrespondent nanometal substrates without graphene.  \n\n \n\n4.4. Experimental procedure \n\n4.4.1. Preparation of active SERS substrates \n\n4.4.1.1. AgGO and AuGO nanocomposites \n\n4.4.1.1.1. Sodium citrate \n\nThe reduction of metallic complexes was made by sodium citrate7. 7.5 mg of GO was \n\nadded to a 5 mg of AgNO3 (HAuCl4) dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water (6x10-4 mol \n\ndm-3 of AgNO3 and 2.4x10-4 mol dm-3 of HAuCl4). The mixture was with stirring \n\nduring 30 min to promote the interaction of silver (gold) ions with graphene oxide \n\nsurface. After that, the suspension was heated until 80 \u00baC, after which 3.760 mL of \n\nsodium citrate (85 mmol dm-3) was added dropwise. The experimental conditions \n\nwere maintained during 1 hour. After cooling to room temperature, the suspension \n\nwas washed by centrifugation. \n\n \n\n\n\n? 4. AgGO and AuGO nanocomposites as SERS substrates \n\n? Page 120 \n\n \n\n4.4.1.1.2. Glucose \n\nThe synthesis of nanocomposites was based on method used by Zhao et al16. 1.2 g of D-\n\n(+)glucose was dissolved into 30 ml of a suspension of GO (1.5 mg/mL) under \n\nsonication during 5 min. 1 mL of ammonia (25%) was added to 10 mL of AgNO3 (0.050 \n\nmol dm-3, 0.0839 g, v = 10 mL). Both phases were mixed and kept in sonication during \n\n5 minutes. After 24h, the suspension showed a grey precipitate, confirming the \n\nformation of AgGO_glucose nanocomposite. The same procedure was made using 10 \n\nmL of 0.050 mol dm-3 HAuCl4 (0.1970 g). \n\n \n\n4.4.1.1.3. Eucalyptus extracts \n\nThe synthesis of AgGO_eucalyptus extract was made dissolving 0.0068 g of AgNO3 in \n\n40 mL (1x10-3 mol dm-3) of GO 0.5 mg/mL17. In the case of AuGO_eucalyptus extract \n\n0.0157 g of HAuCl4 in 40 mL (1x10-3 mol dm-3) of GO 0.5 mg/mL. The mixture was in \n\nstirring during 10 minutes and after that the eucalyptus extracts (0.0283 g) were \n\nadded. The stirring was kept for about 5 minutes to ensure the complete dissolution of \n\nreducing agent. The silver nanoparticles were formed after 24 hours17. \n\n \n\n4.4.1.1.4. Hydroxylamine  \n\nAn aqueous solution 100 mM (2 mL) of NH2OH was prepared and the pH was \n\nadjusted to 12.0 \u2013 12.5 with a 0.1M NaOH solution in stirring18. 200 \u00b5L of a 10 mM \n\nsolution of HAuCl4 in water and 255 \u00b5L of 4mg/mL GO suspension (final \n\nconcentration of GO was 0.51 mg/mL) were, simultaneously, introduced into the vial \n\nunder vigorous stirring. The color of the solution changed to dark blue/black. The \n\nnanoparticles were purified by centrifugation to remove the NaOH from the \n\nsuspension. The AuNS were stored in water at room temperature. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n? 4. AgGO and AuGO nanocomposites as SERS substrates \n\n \n\n? Page 121 \n\n \n\n4.4.1.2. PVA membranes \n\n14 g of PVA (Mw 89,000 \u2013 98,000; 99% hydrolysed) was dissolved in 100 mL of water \n\nduring 4 hours, at 80 \u00baC with vigorous stirring. Approximately, 1 g of this solution was \n\nplaced in a glass container and was crosslink by three cycles of freeze-thawing (+20 \n\n\u00baC, -20 \u00baC)4 21. After complete this process, the final membranes were dried by \n\nlyophilisation.  \n\n \n\n4.4.2. SERS measurements \n\nThe Raman spectra and SERS were recorded using a Bruker RFS100/S FT-Raman \n\nspectrometer (Nd:YAG laser, 1064 nm excitation). Micro-Raman experiments were \n\nperformed at room temperature using the 488 nm line of an Ar+ laser with an \n\nincident power in the 1\u20138 mW range. The light was focused and collected with an \n\nOlympus microscope (100_ objective) and a ?super-notchplus? filter from Kaiser was \n\nused to eliminate elastic light.

Page 127 \n\n \n\n5.1. Introduction \n\nDifferent types of SERS substrates have been developed involving either pure or \n\nsupported nanostructured metals, mostly gold and silver. A fundamental limitation of \n\nthese planar metal SERS-active surfaces is that analyte molecules must rely on slow \n\ndiffusion from the bulk solution to the surface to facilitate molecule-metal \n\ninteractions, an essential prerequisite for SERS detection. Thus long detection times \n\nare required to achieve reasonable sensitivities for planar SERS sensors, which is \n\nunfavourable for online real-time analysis. At the same time, the effective surface \n\narea of planar nanoparticle-presenting substrates is limited. A simpler and widely \n\nemployed approach to SERS detection is to directly mix metal colloids with target \n\nanalytes1. The metal nanoparticle aggregates containing many ?hot spots? in solution \n\ncan present a large total surface area, thus facilitating effective interactions with \n\nanalytes and generation of strong Raman scattering emission. In comparison to SERS \n\nsensing using nanostructured metal films, which are inherently planar detectors, this \n\napproach allows direct probing of analytes within a defined volume of solution, \n\nthereby providing higher sensitivity. However, metal colloid aggregates are inherently \n\nunstable and tend to precipitate from solution, resulting in loss of SERS signals. The \n\naddition of surfactants or hydrophilic polymers can stabilize the colloids, but these \n\nreagents are known to interfere with the SERS signals of target analytes2,3. It would \n\nthus be advantageous to develop a SERS detection element capable of providing high \n\nsensitivity through the use of volumetric detection together with the excellent \n\nstability of planar nanostructured surfaces, while simultaneously offering enhanced \n\nanalyte-metal interactions for rapid online detection.  \n\nInterestingly, natural nanofibrillar structures such as bacterial cellulose (BC) with \n\nsilver nanoparticles can act as active SERS substrates4. Bacterial cellulose was used \n\nas a template to grow Ag nanoparticles. Due to the distinctive three-dimensional (3D) \n\nnanofibrillar structure of BC, the resulting nanocomposites were made up of \n\ninterconnected nanofilaments with discrete Ag nanoparticles at their surfaces \n\noriginating active SERS substrates. The high interfacial area provided by Ag-BC \n\ncellulosic matrix for the deposition of Ag nanoparticles where organic ligands can \n\nadsorb, lead to strong Raman enhancement. The importance of substrate three-\n\n\n\n? 5. Electrospun fibrous membranes decorated with noble nanoparticles \n\n \n\n? Page 128 \n\n \n\ndimensionality for SERS was highlighted by several researchers 3,5,6. In contrast to \n\nconventional planar SERS detectors, 3D structures combines convective flow and \n\nshort diffusion length scales to significantly reduce the time required for analyte \n\nmolecules to reach the SERS-active surfaces. Furthermore, when compared to \n\ncolloidal solutions, the 3D nanostructures concentrate the metal and present a very \n\nhigh surface area, resulting in much greater interaction between analyte molecules \n\nand SERS-active sites. However, most of the methodologies used to prepare these \n\nsubstrates such as sputtering, physical vapour deposition or electron beam \n\nlithography are extremely difficult to find in conventional laboratories. To further \n\nfacilitate and broaden the SERS application, it is important to explore facile, cost \n\neffective, scalable, and reproducible approaches for the preparation of nanostructured \n\nSERS substrates with controlled morphologies and structures of nanoparticle \n\naggregations to achieve ultrahigh SERS activities/sensitivities. \n\nElectrospinning is a remarkably robust and versatile approach to synthesize large-\n\nscale 3D networked nanofibre membranes with extremely high surface area-to-volume \n\nratios, uniformity and mechanical resilience which could be used as nanostructure-\n\nframeworks to assemble hierarchical nanostructures for 3D SERS substrates7. The \n\nnanomaterials-processing technique of electrospinning provides a versatile approach \n\nfor the convenient fabrication of fibres with diameters typically ranging from tens to \n\nhundreds of nanometers. \n\nNoble metal nanoparticles embedded electrospun nanofibres have been studied widely \n\ndue to their applications in catalysis, antimicrobial, microelectronics, etc8. The SERS \n\napplication of these types of structures has also raised the interested of several \n\nresearchers9-13. \n\nThe preparation of SERS substrates containing noble metal nanoparticles involves \n\ntwo main routes: The noble metal NPs can be embedded in the electrospun nanofibers \n\nor assembled onto the outer surfaces of the electrospun nanofibres. In the former case, \n\nthe analyte molecules are required to permeate into the nanofibres to access the \n\nSERS-active noble metal NPs encapsulated inside the polymer nanofibres, which may \n\nbe not applicable to some target analytes. In the second possibility, the assembled \n\nnanoparticles are more available to directly interact with the analyte.  \n\n\n\n? 5. Electrospun fibrous membranes decorated with noble nanoparticles \n\n \n\n? Page 129 \n\n \n\nFor example, Xiaofei Li et al.11 prepared electrospun PVA nanofibres embedded with \n\nAu\u2013Ag alloy NPs. The NPs were obtained by co-reduction of AgNO3 and HAuCl4, with \n\nsodium citrate as a reducing agent in the presence of dilute PVA aqueous solution. \n\nThen, the substrates of PVA/Au\u2013Ag nanofibers were successfully prepared by \n\nelectrospinning. Different SERS signals of PVA/Au\u2013Ag nanofibre could be observed \n\nwith different analyte molecules (4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA), pyridine, and \n\nthiophenol) molecules. Interestingly, the electrospun PVA/Au\u2013Ag nanofibre substrate \n\nshowed the better SERS sensitivity in comparison with the drop-cast film. Minhua \n\nCao et al12 also prepared PVA nanofibres with high concentration of Au NPs on the \n\nfibres and high sensitivity in the surface enhanced Raman scattering was obtained. \n\nThe high concentration of Au NPs was prepared in 10 wt% PVA solution by one step \n\nsynthesis. The distance between adjacent Au NPs became closer with the increasing \n\nthe amount of NPs. SERS spectra showed a significant Raman signal enhancement of \n\n4-MBA molecules, which were absorbed on the surface of PVA/Au nanofibres, even \n\nunder a relatively low concentration (10?6 mol dm-3). The nanofibres also showed the \n\nbetter SERS performance in comparison to the cast-films. \n\nThe assembling of SERS-active noble metal NPs onto the outer surfaces of the \n\nelectrospun nanofibres was also tested for several authors. For example, Ag \n\nnanoparticles were decorated on polyacrylonitrile14 or poly(methyl methacrylate) \n\nnanofibre frameworks15 via wet-chemistry routes, and Au nanorods were assembled \n\non poly(2-vinyl pyridine) nanofibre-frameworks by a drop-cast method16 or \n\nimmobilized onto polycaprolactone nanofibre-frameworks via polyelectrolyte \n\ndecoration. In these cases, the assembled NPs on the outer surface of the electrospun \n\nnanofibres are the key building blocks to achieve SERS-activity, which facilitate \n\nanalyte molecules to be trapped directly onto the ?hot-spots?. \n\nFrom the above, it is clear that when considering the development of highly active \n\nsolid substrates for SERS, the surface geometry, that is the micro- and nano-\n\ntopography of the substrates, is an important parameter to consider. In this chapter \n\nwe present the work developed with the aim to obtain efficient and free standing \n\nSERS substrate materials prepared by electrospinning. Electrospun nanofibrous \n\nmembranes can combine the flexible and portable properties of the polymeric \n\nmembrane mats and the plasmonic activity of noble NPs with and without graphene. \n\n\n\n? 5. Electrospun fibrous membranes decorated with noble nanoparticles \n\n \n\n? Page 130 \n\n \n\nSince poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was used to produce membranes with silver \n\nnanoparticles as SERS substrates (Chapter 2) and this polymer is also widely used to \n\nproduce electrospun fibres, we studied the preparation of such type of fibres with Ag \n\nNPs and AgGO nanocomposites.  \n\nWe also tested the assembling of previously prepared NPs and NPs/GO \n\nnanocomposites on polyacrylonitrile (PAN) electrospun mantles used as a physical \n\nsupport for the suspensions.  \n\n \n\n5.1. Results and Discussion \n\nMany parameters can affect the electrospinning process, including (a) the solution \n\nproperties such as polymer molecular weight, viscosity, conductivity, elasticity, and \n\nsurface tension; (b) process parameters such as electric potential, flow rate, distance \n\nbetween needle tip and collector, needle inner diameter; and (c) ambient parameters \n\nlike temperature, humidity, and air velocity in the electrospinning chamber. For \n\nexample, the polymer solution for electrospinning should have a concentration high \n\nenough to maintain polymer entanglement, but not too high to inhibit deformation \n\ncaused by the electric field. Improper distance between needle and collector may \n\nresult in a rough and beaded mat with the porosity also severely decreased. The \n\napplied voltage can produce ionized solution and generate elongation and splitting, \n\nwhich would form a uniform fibre structure at a proper level. Whereas, boosting the \n\nvoltage to an extreme high value would result in an unstable electrospinning. In a \n\nword, electrospinning parameters are quite essential which deserve serious attention. \n\nThe polymeric structures of the two polymers used to prepare the electrospun \n\nmembranes, PVA and PAN, are represented in Figure 5.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n? 5.

These different approaches were selected sequentially as a \n\nconsequence of the successive results obtained during the experimental work. \n\n-In the first case, we prepared PVA suspensions with the addition of Ag colloid (Ag-\n\nPVA) or AgGO suspension (AgGO-PVA). In both cases, glucose was used as the \n\nreducing agent of silver. These suspensions were directly electrospun after the \n\nadjustment of the electrospinning parameters; \n\n-In the second case, we choose PAN because we found that it was easier to process the \n\nfibres from this polymer than from PVA. First, we prepared simple PAN fibres and \n\nafter, the NPs or the nanocomposites were assembled by dipping the PAN mantle \n\ninside the suspensions aiming to promote a physical adsorption of the NPs and the \n\nnanocomposites on the electrospun membrane. The materials produced by this \n\nmethod were denoted by NP_sodium citrate_PAN, NP_glucose_PAN, NPGO_sodium \n\ncitrate_PAN and NP_glucose_PAN, according to the reducing agent used; \n\n-Finally, we treated the as-spun PAN fibres with hydroxylamine (HAD) aiming to \n\npromote the surface functionalization through amidoxime (-C(NH2)=N-OH) groups, \n\nfollowing a method described by Lifeng Zhang14. The amidoxime group is a \n\ncoordinating/chelating group with high affinity to metal ions, then allowing the \n\nnucleation of metal nanoparticles. The introduction of graphene in this system was \n\nalso performed as described in the experimental methodology. The prepared materials \n\nwere denoted by nanocomposites-HDA-PAN. \n\n \n\na) b) \n\n\n\n? 5. Electrospun fibrous membranes decorated with noble nanoparticles \n\n \n\n? Page 132 \n\n \n\n5.1.1.

Electrospun fibrous membranes decorated with noble nanoparticles \n\n \n\n? Page 134 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe SERS activity/sensitivity of Ag-PVA nanofibrous membranes was studied with \n\nthiosalicylic acid (SHsal) as the probe molecule. In a first approach, the Ag-PVA \n\nmembrane was tested as SERS substrate using SHsal ethanolic solution at a \n\nconcentration of 10-1 mol dm-3. In Figure 5.3 (LEFT) it is possible to observe that when \n\nthe SHsal solution was deposited on Ag-PVA membrane (red line) Raman signals \n\nfrom SHsal (at 1583, 1558 and 1032 cm-1) are present. All the other peaks are from \n\nPVA polymer. Since the Ag-PVA substrate showed no characteristic Raman peaks \n\nfrom PVA (grey line), it is possible say that the peaks signed at red curve (except \n\n1583, 1558 and 1032 cm-1) are the confirmation of SERS effect with respect to PVA. \n\nHowever, the peaks attributed to SHsal are not SERS effect but are Raman peaks. To \n\nconfirm this statement, the same quantity of SHsal solutions 10-2 and 10-3 mol dm-3, \n\nwhich was used in the Ag-PVA membranes, was deposited on a glass slice and let it \n\ndry. After dried, the Raman spectra of such solutions were made and are shown in \n\nFigure 5.3 (RIGHT). The solution of SHsal at concentration of 10-2 mol dm-3 showed \n\nRaman peaks which means that the peaks attributed to SHsal (10-1 mol dm-3) when \n\nsuch solution was deposited on Ag-PVA cannot be described as SERS effect but as \n\nRaman signals.  \n\nThese results showed that Ag-PVA can act as SERS substrate for PVA. However was \n\nimportant verify the sensitivity of this material to the analyte solution. In Figure 5.4 \n\nare the Raman spectra of SHsal in several concentrations (10-1 to 10-4 mol dm-3) \n\ndeposited on Ag-PVA. It is possible observe that Ag-PVA has the capability of detect \n\nSHsal solution at 10-3 mol dm-3 by SERS technique.  \n\nFigure 5.5 shows the ?max of the Ag-PVA with SHsal in several concentrations. The \n\nchange in the local dielectric due to molecule absorption was measured by a shift in \n\nthe localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) ?max18. When the SHsal was deposited \n\non the Ag-PVA nanofibrous membranes, the ?max shifted depending on the \n\nconcentration of SHsal ethanolic solution. Although more studies are needed to \n\naccurate the tendency of Ag-PVA ?max shifts according the concentration of Raman \n\nprobe molecule it can be said that the results showed in Figure 5.5 confirm the results \n\nof SERS spectrum in terms of limit detection of SHsal in Ag-PVA nanofibrous \n\nmembranes.  \n\n\n\n? 5.

For instance, SERS signals of probe molecules such as \n\nrhodamine 6G and methylene blue are shown to be further enhanced several-fold \n\nwhen compared against those of pure metal nanoparticles, with detection limits \n\nreaching nanomolar (nM) levels20.  \n\nTo try to enhance the limit detection of the previously prepared Ag-PVA fibre \n\nmantles, we prepared AgGO suspension using glucose as the  reducing agent based on \n\nthe method described by Zhao et al.17. These AgGO nanocomposites were then \n\nintroduced in the PVA solution before electrospinning. \n\nAlthough PVA has good mechanical properties in the dry state, its applications can be \n\nlimited by its hydrophilicity21. During the experimental work we started to face this \n\nlimitation and because of that we decided to introduce the crosslink procedure to \n\nthese fibres. Linear polymer can be joined by other chains at points along their \n\nlengths to make cross-linked structures for the improvement of mechanical properties \n\nand anti-water solubility21. PVA hydrogels can be cross-linked through the use of \n\nbifunctional agents such as glutaraldehyde, by using electron beam or ?-radiation, or \n\nby a ?freezing-thawing\u2018 process. The later process avoids toxicity issues; furthermore, \n\nthese physically cross-linked materials also exhibit higher mechanical strength and \n\nelasticity than PVA gels cross-linked by other methods22. Due to mentioned reasons, \n\nAgGO-PVA (about 0.06 AgGO/PVA (w/w)) was exposed to freeze-thawing crosslinking \n\nand the effects of this process in SERS measurements were considered.  \n\n  \n\nFigure 5.6 \u2013 SEM images of AgGO-PVA (about 0.06 AgGO/PVA (w/w)) without crosslinking effect (LEFT) \n\nand after freeze-thawing process (RIGHT). \n\n\n\n? 5. Electrospun fibrous membranes decorated with noble nanoparticles \n\n \n\n? Page 137 \n\n \n\nFrom the SEM observation, the entanglement of the AgGO-PVA nanofibrous \n\nmembranes with and without crosslinking is identical. However, after cross-linking \n\nthe fibres seems to show a small increment in the average size diameter (Figure 5.6, \n\nLeft).  \n\nAlthough, the presence of AgGO in the PVA mantles is not clear from the SEM \n\nobservation, the Raman spectroscopy shows the presence of GO. The ratio ID/IG has \n\nthe same value for both types of mantles, which was expected since the crosslinking \n\nprocess should not change the reduction degree of AgGO present in the PVA fibres \n\n(Figure 5.7). \n\n \n\n1700 1600 1500 1400 1300 1200 1100 1000 900 800 700\n\n0.0020\n\n0.0025\n\n0.0030\n\n0.0035\n\n0.0040\n\n0.0045\n\n0.0050\n\n0.0055\n\n0.0060\n\nR\na\n\nm\na\n\nn\n I\n\nn\nte\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\na\n.u\n\n.)\n\nRaman shift (cm\n-1\n\n)\n\n AgGO-PVA\n\n1589 cm\n-1\n\n1291 cm\n-1\n\nI\nD\n / I\n\nG\n = 1.21\n\n \n\n1700 1600 1500 1400 1300 1200 1100 1000 900 800 700\n\n0.0015\n\n0.0020\n\n0.0025\n\n0.0030\n\n0.0035\n\n0.0040\n\n0.0045\n\n0.0050\n\nR\na\n\nm\na\n\nn\n I\n\nn\nte\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\na\n.u\n\n.)\n\nRaman shift (cm\n-1\n\n)\n\n AgGO-PVA\n\n1591 cm\n-1\n\n1289 cm\n-1 I\n\nD\n / I\n\nG\n = 1.23\n\n \n\nFigure 5.7 \u2013 Raman analysis of AgGO-PVA without (left) and with crosslinking (right). \n\nThe same SERS experiments previously described for the Ag-PVA membranes \n\n(section 6.2.1) were also performed with AgGO-PVA membranes with and without \n\ncrosslinking (Figure 5.8). \n\n\n\n? 5.

In the case of AgGO-\n\nPVA without crosslinking the concentration of 10-5 mol dm-3 was not tested since 10-4 mol dm-3 SHsal \n\nsolution was not identified with this membrane.  \n\n \n\nThe typical peak of SHsal around 1030 cm-1 was identified by AgGO-PVA without \n\ncrosslinking at concentrations of 10-3 mol dm-3. This limit of detection is the same as \n\nfound with Ag-PVA nanofibrous membranes without GO. However, in this case it is \n\npossible to identify others SHsal Raman peaks at around 840, 1115 and 1150 cm-1. \n\nThese SHsal peaks were not previously detected in the absence of GO.  \n\nThe detection limit of the SHsal at the freeze-thawed AgGO-PVA membranes surface \n\nincreased until 10-4 mol dm-3, which seems to indicate that the crosslinking process \n\nimproved the analyte detection by SERS.

In the case of the Ag-PVA with \n\ncrosslinking shows that the cycles of freeze-thawing can be responsible for silver \n\naggregates, since the LSPR ?max of Ag nanoparticles is redshifted. We should also \n\nremind that in the present case, the Ag NPs are localized at the graphene surface and \n\nnor freely dispersed in the polymer fibres. \n\nContrary to the results obtained to Ag-PVA, the LSPR ?max of Ag nanoparticles \n\npresent in AgGO composites did not show a direct relationship with the SHsal \n\nconcentration deposited on the AgGO-PVA mantles (Figure 5. 10). One possible \n\nreason for this behaviour is that the presence of graphene sheets can also influence \n\nthe LSPR of the silver nanoparticles.  \n\nFrom the previous results and with respect to the detection limit of the testing \n\nmolecule used, it seems that the crosslinking process can help to increase the \n\npotential use of these types of membranes as SERS substrates. A tentative \n\nexplanation for this observation may be related with a rearrangement between the \n\nfibres, characteristic of the cross-linking procedure, that simultaneously promote the \n\nre-arrangement of the nano-fillers that may became closer and promote more SERS \n\nactive sites. \n\n \n\n\n\n? 5.

Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) mantles imbibed on \n\ncolloidal suspensions \n\nThe polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is widely used to form fibres by electrospinning. PAN is \n\nnot soluble in water what can constitute an advantage over PVA if the final \n\nelectrospun mantles are conceived as a substrate to detect analytes in aqueous \n\nsolution.  \n\nAccording to literature, metal nanoparticles attached to electrospun fibres can adsorb \n\nanalytes directly on their surfaces, leading to larger SERS sensitivity. Such type of \n\nSERS substrates can be prepared by attaching metal nanoparticles onto electrospun \n\nfibres via methods such as drop-casting, electroplating, sputter-coating, chemical \n\nreduction, and electroless plating 16,23-27. These fibrous substrates possess interesting \n\nproperties such as thermal diffusivity, conductivity, electrocatalytic activity, and \n\nSERS sensitivity. For instance, Singameni et al. 16 described a high SERS sensitivity \n\nobtained from a substrate composed by oriented Au nanorods on electrospun \n\nnanofibres prepared using the drop-cast method.  \n\n \n\n5.1.3.1. Non functionalized PAN electrospun mantles \n\nIn this work, PAN 14% (w/w) electrospun mantle was produced according to the \n\nparameters described in 5.3.2.2 section. The resultant fibre PAN mats present several \n\nbeads randomly dispersed through the fibres, as can be observed in the SEM images \n\n(Figure 5.11). Although it could be possible to continue optimizing the electrospinning \n\nparameters in order to minimize the beads presence, this was not considered of \n\nutmost importance for the present work, since these defects could somehow help the \n\nsupport of the NPs and NPsGO nanostructures. \n\n \n\n\n\n? 5.

The same procedure was used with suspensions containing AgGO \n\nand AuGO nanocomposites in suspension prepared also using both reducing agents \n\nreferred before.  \n\nThe characterization of these materials by SEM and UV-vis spectroscopy is \n\nsummarized in Figure 5.12.  \n\n\n\n? 5.

Page 144 \n\n \n\nFirst of all, from these characterization results (Figure 5.12), it is possible to see that \n\nthe nanomaterials were really entrapped in the PAN electropun network, particularly \n\nin the case of the NPsGO nanocomposites. This latter statement can be understood \n\ndue to size constrains. \n\nThe SEM images (Figure 5.12) show that the glucose produces metal nanoparticles \n\nbigger than those produced with sodium citrate. The ?max absorbance of Ag_sodium \n\ncitrate_PAN was not according the SEM images; the ?max absorbance in 430 nm \n\nindicates bigger nanoparticle than in Ag_glucose_PAN (417 nm). The maximum \n\nabsorbance peak positions of Au_sodium citrate_PAN (544 nm) and Au_glucose_PAN \n\n(550 nm) are according to SEM images.  \n\nThe distribution of silver and gold nanoparticles is uniform at the graphene oxide \n\nsurface and these nanocomposites are really entrapped in the electrospun fibres. The \n\nmetal nanoparticles prepared via glucose show some aggregates on the PAN fibres \n\nwhereas the nanoparticles in Ag_sodium citrate_PAN and Au_sodium citrate_PAN \n\nare well distributed but difficult to identify by SEM due to their small size.  \n\nAll the produced PAN mantles were tested for SERS activity (Figure 5.13). Similarly \n\nto the previous PVA membranes, SHsal ethanolic solution at10-3 mol dm-3 \n\nconcentration was the Raman probe deposited on PAN membranes.  \n\nAlthough the intensity was very weak, the typical Raman peak of SHsal, around 1030 \n\ncm-1, was present in AgGO_sodium citrate_PAN, AgGO_glucose_PAN and \n\nAuGO_glucose_PAN. \n\nIn the case of Au_glucose_PAN it was possible to identify four peaks of SHsal: 998, \n\n1070 and 1563 cm-1 with very weak intensity and at 1027 cm-1 with medium intensity.  \n\nFor Ag_glucose_PAN, seven peaks of SHsal were identified, one very strong (1029 cm-\n\n1), three medium (1112, 1155 and 1558 cm-1) and three very weak (838, 1457 and 1579 \n\ncm-1). \n\n\n\n? 5.

Page 146 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe present approach to prepare PAN mantles followed by its immersion on \n\nsuspensions, in general, produces materials that can act as SERS substrates. The \n\nhomogeneity and the good distribution of the nanoparticles and graphene oxide sheets \n\nat the top of PAN mantles can be exploited to other applications besides SERS, such \n\nas catalysis28,29.  \n\n \n\n5.1.3.2. Functionalized PAN electrospun mantles \n\nAnother approach to link the metal NPS to the electrospun PAN fibres was adapted \n\nfrom a methodology described by Zhang et al14. These authors prepared flexible and \n\nactive SERS substrates by electroless plating of Ag NPs on the surface of electrospun \n\nnanofibers via a seed-mediated growth process. First they functionalized PAN \n\nmicrofibers using hydroxylamine (HDA), followed by seeding with palladium NPs to \n\npromote the Ag NPs growth. Here, this methodology was adapted to functionalize the \n\nelectrospun PAN-based membranes before the interaction with Ag NPs and AgGO \n\nnanocomposites (please see section 6.4.3.2.2). The methodology followed to prepare \n\nthese materials is schematized in Figure 5. 14. \n\nThe surface modification and activation of the fibres produced by electrospinning can \n\nsignificantly influence the deposition of Ag NPs on the microfibers. The surface of \n\nPAN microfibers was modified through amidoxime (-C(NH2)=N-OH) surface \n\nfunctionalization. Amidoximation of PAN microfibers resulted in the formation of \n\n?C(NH2)=N?OH groups on the fibre surfaces, leading to a considerable increase of \n\nhydrophilicity for the microfibrous membranes14.  \n\n \n\n\n\n? 5.

Page 147 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5. 14 \u2013 Preparation scheme of four different types of materials produced with PAN functionalized: \n\nAg-HDA-PAN, AgGO-HDA-PAN, rGO-Ag-HDA-PAN and Ag-GO-HDA-PAN. \n\n \n\nAs schematized in Figure 5.14, four different routes to prepare new materials were \n\nfollowed. A common initial preparation of the fibres was done: the activation of the \n\nPAN fibre surfaces with hydroxylamine (HAD). The amidoxime functionalized PAN \n\nfibres were then i) immersed on AgNPs colloidal suspension overnight (Ag-HAD-\n\nPAN); ii) immersed on AgGO suspension overnight (AgGO-HAD-PAN); iii) on AgNPs \n\ncolloidal suspension overnight dried and after immersed on a GO suspension \n\npreviously reduced with HAD (rGO) for 24 hr, (rGO-Ag-HAD-PAN); iv) immersed in \n\nGO suspensions with different concentrations during 24 hr, followed by Ag NPs \n\nattachment as referred in the previous point. \n\nThe presence of Ag NPs in the substrate Ag-HDA-PAN was confirmed by SEM (Figure \n\n5.15) and also qualitative EDS analysis confirmed the silver presence (not shown). \n\nThe UV-vis absorbance shows a maximum at approximately 370 nm, which is a well-\n\nknown peak position that indicates the presence of silver nanoparticles30.  \n\n\n\n? 5.

Page 148 \n\n \n\nThe SEM image of AgGO-HDA-PAN indicates the coating of the functionalized PAN \n\nfibres with the AgGO sheets, showing a good dispersion through the fibres (Figure 5.15). \n\nThe substrate rGO-Ag-HDA-PAN, clearly show the presence of rGO covering the \n\nfibres with the Ag NPs on the top (Figure 5.15). In the Ag-GO-HDA-PAN, the presence \n\nof GO sheets is also clearly observed in SEM image; however it seems that the GO \n\nsheets were mainly wrapped around the PAN fibres (Figure 5.15).  \n\nAll the previous materials prepared were tested with Rodhamine 6G (R6G) for their \n\nSERS activity. The aqueous solution of Raman probe was drop-cast onto the surface of \n\nthe substrates.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.15 \u2013 SEM images from the samples Ag-HDA-PAN, AgGO-HDA-PAN, rGO-Ag-HDA-PAN, and \n\nAg-GO-HDA-PAN. \n\n \n\n\n\n? 5. Electrospun fibrous membranes decorated with noble nanoparticles \n\n \n\n? Page 149 \n\n \n\nThe substrate Ag-HDA-PAN showed a very good SERS spectrum for R6G at 10-3 mol \n\ndm-3 concentration, being possible to identify the peaks localized at 775, 1183, 1306, \n\n1360, 1449, 1505, 1597, and 1643 cm-1 (Figure 5.16). Almost the same peaks were \n\nidentified at 10-5 mol dm-3. Surprisingly, at the concentration of R6G 10-6 mol dm-3 any \n\npeak was observed.  \n\nThe absorbance spectra of all these samples were acquired (Figure 5.17). The shift of \n\nLSPR ?max as function of R6G concentration shows that the shift of ?max starts to \n\nstabilize between 10-4 and 10-5 mol dm-3. Such result is according to SERS results in \n\nterms of limit detection of this substrate.  \n\n \n\n1700 1600 1500 1400 1300 1200 1100 1000 900 800 700\n\n+ R6G 1E-6M\n\n+ R6G 1E-5M\n\n+ R6G 1E-4M\n\n+ R6G 1E-3M\n\n+ R6G 1E-2M\n\nAg-HDA-PAN\n\n R\na\n\nm\na\n\nn\n I\n\nn\nte\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\na\n.u\n\n.)\n\nRaman shift (cm\n-1\n\n)\n\nR6G 1E-2 M\n\nAg-HDA-PAN\n\n0.005\n\n0.010\n\n0.015\n\n0.020\n\n0.025\n\n0.030\n\n0.000\n\n0.005\n\n0.010\n\n0.015\n\n0.020\n\n0.025\n\n0.030\n\n0.035\n\n1\n6\n\n4\n7\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n1\n1\n\n8\n1\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n1\n3\n\n0\n6\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n1\n3\n\n6\n0\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n0.000\n\n0.005\n\n0.010\n\n0.015\n\n0.020\n\n0.025\n\n1\n1\n\n8\n3\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n1\n3\n\n0\n6\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n1\n3\n\n6\n2\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n1\n5\n\n0\n8\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n-0.005\n\n-0.004\n\n-0.003\n\n-0.002\n\n-0.001\n\n0.000\n\n0.001\n\n0.002\n\n0.003\n\n0.004\n\n0.005\n\n0.006\n\n0.007\n\n0.008\n\n0.009\n\n0.010\n\n1\n1\n\n8\n2\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n1\n3\n\n1\n0\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n1\n3\n\n6\n0\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n1\n5\n\n0\n8\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n1\n6\n\n4\n5\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n1\n4\n\n4\n9\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n1\n5\n\n9\n7\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n1\n5\n\n0\n5\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n1\n6\n\n4\n3\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n-0.015\n\n-0.010\n\n-0.005\n\n0.000\n\n0.005\n\n0.010\n\n0.015\n\n0.020\n\n1\n1\n\n7\n9\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n1\n3\n\n0\n6\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n1\n3\n\n6\n0\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n1\n5\n\n0\n5\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n1\n5\n\n9\n5\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n1\n6\n\n4\n4\n\n c\nm\n\n-1\n\n-0.014\n\n-0.012\n\n-0.010\n\n-0.008\n\n-0.006\n\n-0.004\n\n-0.002\n\n0.000\n\n0.002\n\n0.004\n\n0.006\n\n \n\nFigure 5.16 \u2013 Limit of detection of R6G in Ag-HDA-PAN substrate.

Page 151 \n\n \n\nIn the case of AgGO-HDA-PAN and Ag-rGO-HDA-PAN (Figure 5.18), the R6G \n\nmolecule was only identified at 10-2 mol dm-3 in both substrates, which means that the \n\npeaks at 1360 and 1505 cm-1 are Raman intensities because the R6G at this \n\nconcentration, deposited onto a glass slice, show the same peaks. In rGO-Ag-HDA-\n\nPAN with R6G at 10-3 mol dm-3, there was a formation of a plateau between 1350 and \n\n1500 cm-1 which rises doubt if this effect indicates SERS activity. So the 10-4 mol dm-3 \n\nconcentration was tested and confirmed that only reliable R6G peaks occurs at 10-2 \n\nmol dm-3. These results indicate that these two substrates did not act as SERS \n\nsubstrates. \n\nThe quantity of GO in AgGO-HAD-PAN was 0.18 mg/mL, which means a proportion \n\nof 1:1 to Ag:GO. So, for the preparation of Ag-GO-HDA-PAN the quantity of GO \n\nchosen to be added was 0.18 mg/mL. The SERS spectrum of 10-3 mol dm-3 R6G \n\nindicates the presence of its most intense peak at 1505 cm-1 (Figure 5.19). However \n\nthe intensity of the peak is very weak and because of that we decided to decrease the \n\nratio between Ag:GO. New materials were prepared with 0.09 mg/mL and 0.06 mg/mL \n\nof GO repeating the experimental procedure. The SERS spectra of R6G with these \n\nnew materials (Figure 5.20) show that the Ag-0.09GO-HDA-PAN was the more \n\nefficient one for R6G detection. The specimen with 0.09 mg/mL of GO shows the peaks \n\nof R6G localized at 775, 1181, 1308, 1360, 1509 and 1645 cm-1 at 10-3 mol dm-3, and at \n\n1509 cm-1 at 10-4 mol dm-3, although with very weak intensity.  \n\nThe presence of D and G bands at 1290 and 1580 cm-1 was shown in all SERS spectra \n\nof all the substrates based on PAN fibres. Its intensities can supress the identification \n\nof the probe molecule; on the other hand, when the SERS peaks show an intensity \n\nenough to overlap the D and G bands, it is possible say that we are in the presence of \n\na good SERS substrate. This is what happens with Ag-0.09GO-HDA-PAN flexible \n\nmicrofibrous substrate.  \n\nThe work present here shows significant suggestions to tune a material that can \n\ncombine the EM and CM in order to obtain a substrate that can be selective and \n\nsensitive to several biomolecules. \n\n\n\n? 5.

Electrospun fibrous membranes decorated with noble nanoparticles \n\n \n\n? Page 153 \n\n \n\n5.2. Conclusion \n\nIn the present work the potentialities of several types of materials based on the \n\npolymeric electrospun fibres for SERS detection were shown. The PVA and PAN were \n\nthe polymers chosen. \n\nThe materials based on PVA, where the synthesis method is based on the inclusion of \n\nsilver nanoparticles and graphene oxide into the fibres, the best results where achieve \n\nfor the membrane with AgGO after the occurrence of the cross-linking process. SHsal \n\nwas detected at 10-4 mol dm-3. For the PVA membranes the cross-linking seems to be \n\ncrucial for the enhancement of the Raman intensities of the probe molecule. This \n\ncould be related with the morphology of the substrates which may interfere with the \n\nSERS active sites. \n\nThe substrates AgGO_sodium citrate, AgGO_glucose_PAN and AuGO_glucose_PAN \n\nacts as SERS substrates. In the first one, the presence of graphene oxide potentiates \n\nthe enhancement of Raman peaks, since in the correspondent substrate without \n\ngraphene there was no Raman peak of SHsal. In the other two substrates, the \n\nAg_glucose_PAN and Au_glucose_PAN shows better enhancement of Raman \n\nintensities than the correspondent substrates with GO. So it can be said that with \n\nglucose as reducing agent, the presence of GO is not favourable to SERS substrate, in \n\nsubstrates prepared by drop-casting. \n\nThe PAN activated substrates were tested for SERS experiments tuning the structure \n\ncomposition of the substrate. The best enhancement of Raman intensities was \n\nobtained for Ag-0.09GO-HDA-PAN substrate, however, the substrate which has only \n\nsilver nanoparticles act as SERS substrates with a sensitivity to 10-5 mol dm-3 of R6G, \n\nwith a very high resolution of SERS peaks. In fact, this is the best result in the set of \n\nmaterials produced based on fibres and showed in this work. \n\nAll the results shown here contribute to the discussion of the preparation of flexible \n\nand manageable substrates to SERS applications.  \n\n \n\n\n\n? 5. Electrospun fibrous membranes decorated with noble nanoparticles \n\n \n\n? Page 154 \n\n \n\n5.3. Experimental procedure \n\n5.3.1. Synthesis of colloidal suspensions and \n\ncomposites-based on graphene \n\nGraphene oxide was prepared by Marcano\u2018s method31. \n\nGO-based nanocomposites were prepared by two different methods. The first one was \n\ndenoted by ?metal_sodium citrate?. The reduction of metal complexes was made based \n\non a previous method described by our work group32. 7.5 mg of GO was added to a 50 \n\nmL of 0.24 mmol dm-3 HAuCl4.3H2O aqueous solution. The mixture was stirred during \n\n30 min to promote the interaction of gold ions with GO surface. After that, the \n\nsuspension was heated until 80 \u00baC, after which 1.880 mL of sodium citrate (85 mmol \n\ndm-3) was added dropwise. The experimental conditions were maintained during 1 \n\nhour. The final product was ?AuGO_sodium citrate?. The same experiment was made \n\nusing silver nitrate (AgGO_sodium citrate). \n\nIn the second method, denoted by ?metal_glucose?, the reducing agent used was \n\nglucose. The synthesis of nanocomposites was based on method used by Zhao et al17, \n\nusing HAuCl4.3H2O. 1.2 g of D-(+)glucose was dissolved into 30 mL of a suspension of \n\nGO (1.5 mg/mL) under sonication during 5 min. 1 mL of ammonia (25%) was added to \n\n10 mL of HAuCl4.3H2O (50 mmol dm-3). Both phases were mixed and kept in \n\nsonication during 5 minutes. The final product was ?AuGO_glucose?. The same \n\nexperimental procedure was followed to prepare silver and GO nanocomposites \n\n(?AgGO_glucose?). \n\nThe experimental procedure described were repeated using only the metal complexes, \n\nwithout GO (Au_sodium citrate, Ag_sodium citrate, Au_glucose, Ag_glucose). Both \n\ntype of suspensions, with and without GO, were used as prepared. \n\n \n\n\n\n? 5. Electrospun fibrous membranes decorated with noble nanoparticles \n\n \n\n? Page 155 \n\n \n\n5.3.2. Preparation of electrospun nanofibrous \n\nmembranes \n\n5.3.2.1. PVA \n\n5.3.2.1.1. Ag-PVA and AgGO-PVA \n\n700 mg of PVA was added to 5 mL of Ag_glucose performing a 14% PVA concentration \n\n(approximately). The mixture was heated at 80 \u00baC, during 3 hours with slow stirring. \n\nThe solution was loaded into 5 mL syringe which had a properly tube attached at the \n\nopen end, and such tube had a stainless steel needle at the opposite end. The needle \n\nwas connected to the emitting electrode of high-voltage supply capable of generating \n\nDC voltages in the range of 0-50 kV. An aluminium foil (64 cm of length and 10 cm of \n\nwidth) was used as the collection screen which was connected to the ground electrode \n\nof the power supply (400 rpm) with the distance between the screen and the needle tip \n\nof 8 \u2013 10 cm. The electrospinning was carried out at 19 \u00baC \u2013 22 \u00baC, and relative \n\nhumidity 22 % - 23%. In order to obtain continuous and homogeneous nanofibres, the \n\nvoltage applied was 23 kV, in a rate of 0.1mL/h. The final mantle was dried in air \n\nbefore being detached from the aluminium foil. The same procedure was made using \n\nAgGO_glucose suspension. \n\n \n\n5.3.2.2. PAN \n\n1.4 g of PAN was dissolved in 10 mL of DMF, with stirring during approximately 18 h. \n\nThe use of electrospinning apparatus was the same as describe in previous section. \n\nHere, the experimental conditions were the following: 2000 rpm of the collector at 12 \n\ncm of the needle, the voltage applied was 20 kV, in a rate of 1.2 mL/h. The procedure \n\nwas followed at 19 \u00baC \u2013 22 \u00baC, and relative humidity 62 % - 50%. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n? 5. Electrospun fibrous membranes decorated with noble nanoparticles \n\n \n\n? Page 156 \n\n \n\n5.3.2.2.1. PAN imbibed on colloidal suspensions \n\nSquares (7 cm x 7 cm, approximately) of PAN mantle were cut and placed upon a \n\nfilter paper inside a Buckner funnel. 5 mL of each suspension of metal nanoparticles \n\n(Au_sodium citrate, Ag_sodium citrate, Au_glucose, Ag_glucose) and graphene \n\nnanocomposites (AuGO_sodium citrate, AgGO_sodium citrate, AuGO_glucose, \n\nAgGO_glucose) were filtered on PAN squares. As the filter papers showed the \n\ncolouring of the suspensions, all the PAN squares and the correspondent filter papers \n\nwere dried in air.  \n\n \n\n5.3.2.2.2. Functionalization of PAN membranes \n\nAg-HDA-PAN \n\nPrior to the growth of Ag NPs, as-electrospun PAN fibrous membranes were first \n\ntreated in 1 mol dm-3 NH2OH aqueous solution at 70 \u00b0C for 5 min; some ?C?N groups \n\non the surface of nanofibres reacted with NH2OH, leading to the formation of \n\n?C(NH2)=N?OH groups. After the treatment, the obtained amidoxime surface-\n\nfunctionalized PAN (HDA-PAN) fibrous membranes were thoroughly rinsed in \n\ndistilled water and dried before the growth of Ag NPs. \n\nThe AgNPs colloidal suspension was prepared by Lee and Meisel method. 90 mg of \n\nAgNO3 was dissolved in 500 mL (0.18 mg/mL) of ultra-pure H2O and brought to \n\nboiling. A solution of 1% sodium citrate (10 mL) was dropwise added. The solution \n\nwas kept on boiling during 1 hour. The Ag sol was yellow-greenish at the final of \n\nsynthesis. \n\nFinally, HAD-PAN was immersed in 30 mL of Ag colloidal suspension overnight. The \n\nAg-HAD-PAN was washed with distilled water and let dried in air. \n\nrGO-Ag-HDA-PAN \n\nReduced graphene oxide (rGO) was previous prepared using hydroxylamine as the \n\nfollowing description: hydroxylamine (final concentration of 100 mmol dm-3) was \n\nadded to 50 mL of 0.5 mg/mL GO with vigorous stirring. The pH of mixture was kept \n\n\n\n? 5. Electrospun fibrous membranes decorated with noble nanoparticles \n\n \n\n? Page 157 \n\n \n\nat 12 and heated in an oil bath at 85 \u00baC; meanwhile the colour of the mixture changed \n\nfrom yellowish brown to homogeneous black indicating the reduction took place. The \n\nAg-HAD-PAN was impregnated with rGO (0.18 mg/mL) during ~24h. The fibrous \n\nmembrane was thoroughly rinsed with distilled water and dried in air before \n\ncharacterization and SERS evaluation.  \n\nAg-GO-HDA-PAN \n\nIn this case, GO was used as the bridge between HAD-PAN and silver NPs. HAD-\n\nPAN was immersed in GO suspensions with different concentrations, 0.18, 0.09 and \n\n0.06 mg/mL, during 24 h. After the interaction with Ag colloidal suspension, the \n\nmantle Ag-GO-HAD-PAN was tested in SERS. The substrates were referred as Ag-\n\n0.18GO-HDA-PAN, Ag-0.09GO-HDA-PAN and Ag-0.06GO-HDA-PAN. \n\nAgGO-HDA-PAN \n\nPreviously, a suspension composed by GO and Ag NPs was synthesized based on Lee \n\nand Meisel method. 18 mg of silver nitrate was added to 100 mL of GO 0.18 mg/mL \n\nsuspension. The mixture heated until boiling. After 10 minutes of reflux, 2 mL of \n\nsodium citrate 20 mg/mL was added dropwise. The boiling was kept during about 60 \n\nmin and the suspension changed the yellow brownish colour to black. In this \n\nsynthesis, the characteristic changing colour of Ag colloid was not present due to \n\nsimultaneous reduction of GO. After that, the same functionalization described to Ag-\n\nHAD-PAN was followed but in this case using the AgGO previous described in this \n\nsection and at the final AgGO-HAD-PAN was produced. \n\n \n\n5.3.3. SERS experiments \n\nA piece of PVA and PAN composites was cut (approximately 5 \u00d7 10 mm) and 4 \u00b5L of \n\nSHsal in several concentrations were deposited on their surface. In the case of \n\nfunctionalized PAN mantles, 4 \u00b5L of R6G in different concentrations was deposited on \n\nthe PAN pieces and let dried. Raman spectra were acquired using Bruker RFS100/S \n\nFT-Raman spectrometer (Nd:YAG laser, 1064 nm excitation). All the experiments \n\n\n\n? 5. Electrospun fibrous membranes decorated with noble nanoparticles \n\n \n\n? Page 158 \n\n \n\nwere acquired with 500 scans but the voltage used was dependent of the material \n\nused (50 \u2013 300 mW). \n\n \n\n5.4.

The enhancement factor is due to electromagnetic2 and chemical \n\nmechanisms3. The latter can be explained when the charge transfer-assisted complex \n\nformation occurs between the molecule and the surface. The electromagnetic \n\nmechanism is associated to a local electromagnetic field enhanced by excited surface \n\nplasmons on a metal surface. In order to increase the selectivity and the limit of \n\ndetection, researchers have improved SERS substrates tuning size and shape of the \n\n1D metal nanostructures which are, normally, the basis of such platforms. Also the \n\ndeposition of the metal nanoparticles was made in flexible supports (cellulose-paper, \n\npolymer mats4), in silicon wafers or glass, using several techniques such as \n\nlithography. Recently, 3D nanostructures (nanowires, nanorods, ordered Au particle \n\narrays, nanoporous silicon, nanotube arrays, and cavity nano antenna arrays with \n\ndense plasmonic nanodots) have been proposed as SERS substrates. \n\nCarbon nanotubes (CNT) have been the subject of extensive research because of their \n\nexcellent electrical, thermal and mechanical properties.

Page 164 \n\n \n\nSERS substrates is a research topic with increasing interest that has been addressed \n\nin several ways: vertically aligned in a silicon support5-7, used as an endoscope tip8,9 or \n\nspecifically functionalized for use as an intracellular probe10. Vertically aligned multi-\n\nwalled carbon nanotube (VAMWCNT) arrays functionalized with gold nanoparticles \n\ngenerate hot-spots after the deposition of analyte solution. These hot-spots are the key \n\nfor a better Raman signal magnification.  \n\nIn this work, we show the potential of the vertically aligned multi-walled carbon \n\nnanotubes covered with gold nanoparticles to detect the four nucleobases (adenine, \n\ncytosine, guanine, and thymine) and the deoxyribonucleic acid molecules. SERS \n\nresults obtained for such molecules are stable during, at least, 24 hours, and the \n\nenhancement factors are between 103 and 105. \n\n \n\n6.2. Results and discussion \n\n6.2.1. Characterization of VAMWCNT-Au \n\nThe SEM images in Figure 6.1 shows a uniformity of the structures with vertical \n\naligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes covered by gold (VAMWCNT_Au). \n\nThe Raman characteristic bands of VAMWCNT_Au and their relative intensity in two \n\ndifferent points of the material indicates its homogeneity. The ID/IG ratio in both \n\nlocations was about 1.3. (Figure 6.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n? 6. Gold covered vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube arrays as highly sensitive SERS substrates \n\n \n\n?

Page 166 \n\n \n\nSERS results are dependent on composition, size, and interparticle spacing of \n\nplasmonic nanoparticles11 which, are the active components of SERS substrates. In \n\nthis study the substrates were formed by VAMWCNT and gold nanoparticles, it was \n\nimportant to verify what was the concentration of AuNP that produced the best SERS \n\nresults. For this study we chosen thiosalicylic acid (SHsal, 0.1M) which is a well-\n\nknown SERS probe. 4?L of an ethanolic solution of SHsal was deposited on the \n\nsurface of VAMWCNT_Au substrates with different gold deposition time (5, 15 and 30 \n\nminutes). All the spectra were acquired at the same conditions: 350 mW and 50 scans. \n\nThe most intense peak of SHsal solution (~1030 cm-1) appears in all substrates but the \n\nspectrum which shows more SHsal bands and more intense was correspondent to \n\nVAMWCNT with 30 min of gold deposition (Figure 6.3). So, this type of substrate was \n\nthe one used in the SERS studies of nucleic acids and DNA molecule. \n\n \n\n2000 1800 1600 1400 1200 1000 800 600\n\n0.000\n\n0.005\n\n0.010\n\n0.015\n\n0.020\n\n0.025\n\nVACNT+Au30min\n\nVACNT+Au15min\n\nR\na\n\nm\na\n\nn\n I\n\nn\nte\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\na\n.u\n\n.)\n\nRaman shift (cm\n-1\n\n)\n\nVACNT+Au5min\n\n \n\nFigure 6.3 \u2013 SERS spectra of thiosalicylic acid 0.1 mol dm-3 using VAMWCNT_Au with 5, 15 and 30 \n\nminute of gold deposition. \n\n \n\n\n\n? 6.

Page 168 \n\n \n\nThe same deposition time of gold nanoparticles was made into a Si surface in order to \n\ncompare, not only SERS substrates efficiency but also the thickness of gold \n\nnanolayers. The nanoparticles of gold were deposited during 30 min on Si and have \n\nabout 5 nm of diameter (Figure 6.4). This calculation was made using the Image J \n\nsoftware. The 30 min of gold deposition produced a layer of gold with 86 nm (Figure \n\n6.5). This statistic value was also calculated by using Image J. \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 6.6 \u2013 SEM images of VAMWCNT-Au substrates after the deposition of 4 \u00b5L of aqueous \n\nthiosalicylic acid 0.1 moldm-3. \n\n \n\nAfter the application of nucleic acid solutions on VAMWCNT_Au, the top view of the \n\nsubstrates was changed from a flat-like surface to small gold islands (SEM images in \n\nFigure 6.6). This feature changes was the key-point to the enhancement of Raman \n\nintensity observed that will be observed with these substrates in all tested analytes. \n\n\n\n? 6. Gold covered vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube arrays as highly sensitive SERS substrates \n\n \n\n? Page 169 \n\n \n\nThis phenomenon was in agreement with the results obtained in the studies of Boisen \n\net al on silicon nanopillars covered by silver12 or gold13.  \n\n \n\n6.2.2. SERS studies  \n\nVAMWCNT_Au substrates were tested with the four nucleobases and DNA solutions \n\n(Figure 6.7). Adenine was detected in a concentration of 10-5 mol dm-3 as lower limit. \n\nAlso cytosine has shown some peaks at the same concentration. Guanine and thymine \n\nwere detected at 10-4M. All the spectra acquired for all bases of DNA were repeated \n\n24h after the first acquisition and all have shown good reproducibility. For such \n\nreason, SERS results did not show dependence on interaction time between analyte \n\nand plasmonic surface with this type of substrates. For comparison, all the \n\nexperiments were performed using gold substrates on Si (Figure 6.8). The adenine and \n\ncytosine were detected at the concentration of 10-5 moldm-3 whereas guanine and \n\nthymine was detected only at concentrations of 10-4 mol dm-3. This means that for all \n\ntested species, the limit of detection obtained was the same as with VAMWCNT_Au. \n\nBut the identification of the analyte was more complete with the substrates that \n\ncontain carbon nanotubes; the number of characteristic bands is smaller in the case of \n\nusing Au_substrates. Moreover, the better quality of the spectra acquired from carbon \n\nstructures covered with gold is evident. In this work, no spectrum was submitted into \n\na mathematical treatment in order to improve the signal/noise ratio. The same \n\nprocedure was made in the experiments where gold deposited on Si substrates was \n\nused. The signal/noise ratio was very low in the latter case being some analyte bands \n\nconfused with noise. In fact, only the bands at 737, 795 and 666 cm-1 for adenine, \n\ncytosine and guanine, respectively, are well defined. All the other bands that were \n\nidentified are poorly defined.  \n\n \n\n\n\n?6. Gold covered vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube arrays as highly sensitive SERS substrates \n\n \n\n?

Page 172 \n\n \n\nThe contribution of each band of each analyte can be observed in Figure 6. 9. The \n\nSERS spectra of the 10-3 moldm-3 of each analyte were deconvoluted in order to \n\nanalyse the contribution in terms of the analyte bands and CNT bands. With the \n\nexception of cytosine, in all SERS spectra the CNT bands (D and G) have the major \n\ncontribution in terms of absolute intensity of the signal. The deconvolution was made \n\nby fitting the peaks with the Lorentz function using Origin 9.0 software. \n\nVAMWCNT_Au substrates provided a vibrational analysis very complete for the \n\nmolecules studied. The proposal of the assignment bands are in the Table 6.1. to Table \n\n6. 4. The deconcolution made by Origin software was not able to show the contribution \n\nof all the peaks for thymine. The peaks localized at 1649 and 1394 cm-1 of thymine \n\nwere assigned as ?very weak? which means that its intensity were very weak and, \n\nprobably, this was the reason why identification was not possible by deconvolution.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n? 6.

Adenine showed a different \n\ntrend, the SPR showed a red-shift with the concentration solutions decreasing (Figure \n\n6.11 and Table 6.6). In fact, by the graphics showed in Figure 6.12, where the LSPR \n\npositions are represented as function of the nucleobase concentration, it is possible to \n\nsee that LSPR positions of VAMWCNT with adenine and cytosine becomes to start \n\nstabilizing at 10-5 moldm-3 and with thymine at 10-4 moldm-3.

SERS Enhancement Factor calculation \n\nThe magnitude of SERS enhancement can be estimated calculating the enhancement \n\nfactor (EF). Although this parameter is maintained only as a comparative factor, it is \n\nan important tool to assess the efficiency of the substrates. We have estimated the EF \n\nconsidering that the analyte molecules were adsorbed on the gold surface of \n\nVAMWCNT-Au substrates, in an estimated depth of 290 \u00b5m, as measured from the \n\nSERS images. \n\nThe EF can be calculated using the following equation21: \n\n                                                  \n          ?\n\n       ?\n                                               (1)    \n\nWhere ISERS and IRS are SERS and Raman signals intensities, NSurf is the number of \n\nanalyte molecules adsorbed in the scattering volume of SERS spectra and Nvol is the \n\naverage number of molecules present at the scattering volume of Raman spectra.  \n\nAn analyte aqueous solution 0.067 M was used to measure the Raman intensity for \n\nEF calculations. The scattering volume is the volume of analyte excited by the laser. \n\nConsidering a laser spot diameter of 350 \u00b5m and the 5mm thickness of the glass tube \n\nused for the aqueous sample, the scattering volume for Raman was 4.81X10-7 dm3, \n\nand Nvol is 3.22X10-8 mol.  \n\nNSurf is calculated by             , where \u00b5SERS is the density of the analyte in SERS \n\nsubstrate and VSERS is the scattering volume of SERS. When the drop of aqueous \n\nanalyte solution (4X10-6 dm3, 1x10-3 M) was deposited on the substrate, the drop \n\nspread through it creating a volume in a cylinder shape with a diameter of 4 mm and \n\n290 \u00b5m height. VSERS was calculated using the laser spot diameter (350 \u00b5m) and the \n\nestimated value of its depth inside the substrate (37.150 \u00b5m). So, NSurf was 3.92X10-12 \n\nand the final equation was \n\n                              \n          ?\n\n       ?\n \n          \n\n         \n?   \n\n     \n\n   \n                        (2) \n\n\n\n? 6. Gold covered vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube arrays as highly sensitive SERS substrates \n\n \n\n? Page 183 \n\n \n\nThe EF was also calculated for flat gold-Si substrates. In this case, its height was \n\nestimated at 86 nm.  The diameter of the spreading solution analyte at its surface was \n\nconsidered the same as in the VAMWCNT-Au substrates (4mm), and EF equation was \n\n                             \n          ?\n\n       ?\n \n          \n\n         \n?   \n\n     \n\n   \n                         (3) \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.13 \u2013 Comparison of the EF calculated for the several bands characteristic of adenine, cytosine, \n\nguanine and thymine present in SERS spectra obtained using VAMWCNT-Au and Si-Au substrates to \n\ndetect 4 ?L of adenine 10-3 mol dm-3. \n\n \n\nThe enhancement factor was calculated for all the bands identified which had \n\ncorrespondence to the Raman spectra of the concentrated aqueous solutions of the \n\nanalytes (Figure 6.13). The carbon nanostructures based-substrates provided EF \n\nbetween 1x104 and 8x105 for the four nucleic acid molecules. In the case of Au_Si \n\nsubstrates the EF maximum obtained was 10 which confirms the efficiency of the \n\nVAMWCNT_Au. \n\n\n\n?6. Gold covered vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube arrays as highly sensitive SERS substrates \n\n \n\n? Page 184 \n\n \n\nThe explanation of such EF provide from the leaning effect of the VAMWCNT_Au \n\nsubstrate12. When a droplet of an aqueous solution was deposited onto the substrate, \n\nand letting evaporate, surface tension caused the vertical aligned carbon nanotubes to \n\nlean towards their nearest neighbours, thus creating self-assembled hot spots. \n\nAnalyte molecules adsorbed at the tips of the carbon nanotube were, then, located \n\nexactly in the hot spots as the nanotubes leaned together. This self-assembling \n\nmechanism creates a large number of electromagnetic hot spots inside the laser \n\nexcitation area, as was shown in other published works using carbon nanotubes22 or \n\nsilicon nanopillars12,13.  \n\n \n\n6.3. Conclusions \n\nNew substrates of vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes covered by gold \n\nnanoparticles (VAMWCNT_Au) were prepared in order to evaluate its development in \n\nSERS detection. \n\nVAMWCNT_Au showed good performance in the detection of adenine and cytosine \n\nwith concentrations as low as 10-5 moldm-3. Guanine and thymine were detected using \n\nthe same type of SERS substrates with lowest concentrations of 10-4 moldm-3. Also the \n\nDNA molecule was detected. \n\nThe well-defined Raman peaks of nucleic acids, enhanced by the presence of \n\nVAMWCNT_Au, is a novelty in biomolecules detected by SERS. This good definition \n\nallows the estimation of the analyte peaks and substrate peaks contribution.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.4. Experimental Procedure \n\n6.4.1. Preparation of VAMWCNT_Au and Au substrates \n\nCNT forest growth was carried out in a hot-wall thermal CVD reactor using a C2H2 \n\n(purityP 99.6%, 300 ppm of H2O, Praxair)\u2013H2 (purityP99,999%, 62 ppm of H2O, \n\n\n\n? 6. Gold covered vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube arrays as highly sensitive SERS substrates \n\n \n\n? Page 185 \n\n \n\nPraxair)\u2013Ar (purity P99,9999%, 60.5 ppm of H2O, Praxair) gas mixture at \n\natmospheric pressure. The reactor consists of a 5 cm inner diameter quartz tube \n\nhoused inside a furnace, equipped with mass flows, electrovalves and a PC control \n\nstation for automatic operation. \n\nIn a typical growth run, the substrates were placed in a quartz boat and loaded into \n\nthe cold zone of the reactor, with the furnace already heated at the temperature of \n\nset-point. The reactor tube was then pumped down to 3 Pa and subsequently filled up \n\nwith Ar to reach the atmospheric pressure. Afterwards, the quartz boat was pushed to \n\nthe centre of the hot zone using a stainless steel arm, allowing a fast heating. Then, a \n\ntwo stepped annealing process was initialised. Firstly, in an inert flow of Ar (1000 \n\nsccm), followed by a treatment in a reductive flow of Ar/H2 (v/v) = 0.4 (700 sccm). \n\nSubsequently, the Ar and H2 flows were adjusted and the C2H2 was added for the \n\nCNTs synthesis. After the growth step, the C2H2 and H2 flows were cut off and the \n\nquartz tube was flushed with Ar flow to remove the reactive gases. Finally, the quartz \n\nboat was pulled to the cold zone for a fast cooling down to room temperature in \n\naround 2min. The furnace and the empty quartz boat were then purged with O2 in \n\nthe hot zone during 10 min to burn out the carbon residuals, becoming the system, \n\nafter that, ready for a new growth run23. \n\nThe gold nanoparticles were deposited on the top of VAMWCNT and Si, using the \n\nsputtering equipment, under vacuum, for 30 min. The final substrates obtained were \n\nVAMWCNT_Au and Si_Au. \n\n \n\n6.4.2. SERS measurements \n\nThe nucleobases solutions were prepared immediately before SERS experiments. 4 ?L \n\nof each analyte solution were deposited on the top of SERS substrates and dried \n\nduring 30 minutes before the spectrum acquisition. After 24h, all the spectra were \n\nagain acquired in order to check if the interaction time between the analyte and \n\nsubstrate has some influence on the sensibility of substrate.   \n\n\n\n?6.

Page 186 \n\n \n\nAll the spectra were acquired with 500 scans, using a FT-Raman Bruker RFS -100/s \n\nspectrometer, 1064 nm laser with power 350 mW. \n\n \n\n6.5.

The study was \n\nalso directed to support these nanocomposites on a physical support (membrane or \n\nfilm) easy to handle, inexpensive and reproducible. The reason to explore the \n\npreparation of these nanocomposites and study their SERS activity is to contribute for \n\nthe development of new substrates for the specific detection of biomolecules. \n\nIn a first step, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) composites were prepared incorporating silver \n\nnanoparticles initially without introduction of carbon nanostructures.  Several \n\nexperimental parameters were considered to obtain the best SERS analysis. The dried \n\nsamples at 105 \u00baC showed the best SERS results. These membranes were stable for \n\nlong periods of time (more than 4 months) and showed the ability to identify nucleic \n\nacids by SERS.  \n\nNext, the synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide (GO) was implemented to \n\nbe used in the preparation of silver and gold nanocomposites. Well exfoliated GO \n\nnano-sheets (single or few layers) were produced at the laboratory. The reduction of \n\nthis nanomaterial with different chemical agents was explored, since its reduction \n\ndegree may be a determinant factor for the application envisaged (biomolecules \n\ninteraction). The chemical reducing agents were selected based on a low toxicity \n\ncriteria and were glucose, sodium citrate, eucalyptus globulus extracts and \n\nhydroxylamine. These reducing agents showed different efficiency to restore the sp2 \n\ncarbon network of graphene. Also, not all the oxygen functional groups were \n\ncompletely removed using these chemicals, under the experimental conditions used. \n\nAdditionally, from the characterization results it was possible to conclude that some \n\nmolecules from the reducing agent were adsorbed at the final rGO material (even \n\nafter washing procedure) what could interfere with the SERS activity determination. \n\nThe preparation of the graphene nanocomposites with silver and gold was performed \n\nwith the different reducing agents previously referred. The SERS activity of these \n\nnew nanocomposites was then explored in the presence of thiosalicylic acid, varying \n\nthe experimental conditions for Raman spectra acquisition. It was interesting to \n\n\n\n? 7. Final remarks \n\n? Page 191 \n\n \n\nverify that both the silver and the gold containing nanocomposites presented the \n\nparticularity to intensify the graphene D and G bands. \n\nFibrous membranes were also prepared by electrospinning with the aim to prepare \n\nSERS supports with different topography and porosity able to promote the creation of \n\nparticular nanoparticles distribution for the establishment of the so-called hot-spots. \n\nThe polymers polyvinyl alcohol and polyacrylonitrile were selected for electrospinning. \n\nUsing this technique, electrospun mantles with silver and gold nanoparticles and the \n\ncorresponding graphene nanocomposites were prepared. Several variables were \n\nstudied, such as the introduction of the nano-fillers during the electrospinning \n\nprocess, posterior deposition of the nano-fillers on the simple electrospun polymeric \n\nfibres and surface functionalization of the simple polymeric membranes to later link \n\nthe nano-fillers. The results obtained showed that this is a promising methodology to \n\nprepare SERS active substrates, although much more optimization work is needed, \n\nthere is still plenty of room for improvements of this methodology. \n\nAt last, the potentialities of using carbon nanotubes forests, produced by chemical \n\nvapour deposition and coated with gold film by sputtering, as new SERS substrates \n\nwere explored. It was found that these nanostructures were suitable for SERS \n\ndetection of DNA bases and DNA itself, representing an interesting route to be \n\noptimized and explored in future work. It is important to highlight the good definition \n\nof the Raman spectra achieved with this type of substrates for these biomolecules. \n\nSummarizing, in this work a great variety of materials was prepared. Several \n\nsubstrates confirmed a good potential for SERS detection of the analytes tested. \n\nHowever, as was verified in this thesis, there are a huge number of variables that \n\nmay interfere with the outcome of a good SERS activity and consequently the \n\ndetection of vestigial concentration of the probe molecules. For example, the probe \n\nmolecules used in this study may not be the most adequate for the specific substrates \n\nprepared in this work, there are a plenty of other possible analytes to evaluate. \n\nFuture work could include, for example, the selection of a restricted number of the \n\nmost promising substrates and the study of this selection with different type of \n\nanalytes.  \n\n\n\n? 7. Final remarks \n\n \n\n? Page 192 \n\n \n\nUsing metal-graphene nanocomposites as SERS substrates instead of the metal alone \n\nwas shown to give better results in some specific conditions, but there is a plethora of \n\nvariables involved. Further efforts should be devoted to the design and synthesis of \n\nnoble metal-graphene nanocomposites to further improved SERS performance. It \n\nremains a grand challenge for creating a general substrate that can detect diverse \n\ntarget analytes. Taking advantages of the high affinity of graphene oxide toward \n\naromatic molecules and the SERS property of nanostructured metals, these \n\ncomposites exhibit great potential for diverse aromatic molecules sensing. \n\nFuture work must include, after a systematic study of the previously referred \n\nparameters, the surface modification of the most promising substrates to fine-tune \n\ntheir SERS activity and make them specific to identify certain biomolecules. In this \n\nway, a contribution to the development of manageable SERS sensors for the selective \n\ndetection of biomolecules in targeted research could be achieved. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnnex \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n?
