Orientador: Jorge Abdala \n\nDergam. Co-orientadores: Silvia das Gra\u00e7as Pompolo e Rubens Pazza.  \n\n \n\nA complexa fam\u00edlia Characidae \u00e9 parte da fauna ictiol\u00f3gica neotropical e conta \n\ncom v\u00e1rias esp\u00e9cies e g\u00eaneros em condi\u00e7\u00e3o de Incertae Sedis. Os g\u00eaneros Astyanax e \n\nOligosarcus, considerados muito aparentados, est\u00e3o inclu\u00eddos nesta fam\u00edlia e abrangem \n\nesp\u00e9cies de pequeno tamanho e expressiva abund\u00e2ncia em muitos rios e c\u00f3rregos da \n\nAm\u00e9rica do sul. Na bacia do rio Doce, no sudeste brasileiro, uma an\u00e1lise morfol\u00f3gica \n\npreliminar permitiu a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de cinco peixes \u201csemelhantes \u00e0 Astyanax\u201d que \n\ncontinham no seu osso maxilar de 8 a 13 dentes. Esses cinco peixes, chamados no \n\npresente trabalho de dentu\u00e7os, foram coletados em simpatria com as esp\u00e9cies Astyanax \n\nbimaculatus (Linneaus, 1758), Astyanax giton (Eigenmann, 1908) e Oligosarcus \n\nargenteus G\u00fcnther, 1864. De modo a determinar a natureza biol\u00f3gica dos dentu\u00e7os, foi \n\nrealizado um estudo multidisciplinar envolvendo dados morfol\u00f3gicos citogen\u00e9ticos e \n\nmoleculares. Os dentu\u00e7os apresentaram configura\u00e7\u00f5es intermedi\u00e1rias entre as esp\u00e9cies \n\nA. giton e O. argenteus no que diz respeito ao n\u00famero de escamas na linha lateral e ao \n\nn\u00famero de dentes no osso maxilar. As an\u00e1lises citogen\u00e9ticas, feitas atrav\u00e9s das t\u00e9cnicas \n\nde Giemsa, bandeamento NOR, bandeamento-C, fluorocromos, e FISH, indicaram que \n\ntodas as esp\u00e9cies de carac\u00eddeos contaram com n\u00famero diploide 2n=50 cromossomos \n\ndiferindo, por\u00e9m, em v\u00e1rios caracteres de sua morfologia cromoss\u00f4mica. Os dentu\u00e7os \n\ncaracterizaram-se por apresentar altos \u00edndices de varia\u00e7\u00e3o cromoss\u00f4mica tanto intra- \n\ncomo inter-individual. Al\u00e9m do mais, eles contaram com v\u00e1rios cromossomos n\u00e3o \n\npare\u00e1veis assim como cromossomos de tamanho diminuto que n\u00e3o s\u00e3o observados em \n\nnenhuma daquelas esp\u00e9cies simp\u00e1tricas de Characidae. Tr\u00eas esp\u00e9cimes dos dentu\u00e7os \n\napresentaram seu fragmento de DNA do gene mitocondrial citocromo b (475 pb) \n\nid\u00eantico aquele de O. argenteus e, contudo, todos os dentu\u00e7os compartilhavam mais \n\nalelos ISSR com os esp\u00e9cimes de A. giton do que com os esp\u00e9cimes de O. argenteus. \n\nPor outro lado, uma esp\u00e9cie de dentu\u00e7o conta com o gene cyt. b id\u00eantico aquele das \n\n\n\nxii \n\n \n\nesp\u00e9cies de A. giton estudadas. A an\u00e1lise de fragmentos ITS-1 (1123 pb) mostrou que os \n\ndentu\u00e7os t\u00eam sequencias mais relacionadas \u00e0 Oligosarcus  argenteus. Os dados, desse \n\nmodo, sugeriram que os dentu\u00e7os s\u00e3o h\u00edbridos entre as esp\u00e9cies A. giton e O. argenteus \n\nrepresentando assim o primeiro caso de hibridismo espont\u00e2neo entre dois g\u00eaneros de \n\npeixes neotropicais. A relev\u00e2ncia de tal descoberta para a biologia da conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\npara as investiga\u00e7\u00f5es filogen\u00e9ticas foram discutidas. \n\n \n\n\n\nxiii \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\n \n\nAGUIAR, Hilton Jeferson Alves Cardoso. M. Sc., Universidade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa, \n\nFebruary, 2011. First report on spontaneous hybridization between Astyanax \n\ngiton Baird &amp; Girard 1854 and Oligosarcus argenteus G\u00fcnther 1864 (Pisces : \n\nCharacidae): Ecological and Phylogenetic inferences. Advisor: Jorge Abdala \n\nDergam. Co-advisors: Silvia das Gra\u00e7as Pompolo and Rubens Pazza.  \n\n \n\nWithin the Neotropical fish fauna, the taxonomically complex family Characidae \n\nhas many species and genera in Incertae Sedis condition. Within this family, the closely \n\nrelated genera Astyanax and Oligosarcus are represented by small sized fishes that are \n\nan expressive proportion of the freshwater biodiversity in many rivers of South \n\nAmerica. In the Doce River Basin, Southeastern Brazil, a preliminary morphologic \n\nanalysis indicated the presence of 5 Astyanax-like fish with unusually high numbers (8-\n\n13) of maxillary teeth which are referred as \u201ctoothed morphs\u201d. These fishes were \n\ncollected in sympatry with Astyanax bimaculatus (Linneaus, 1758), Astyanax giton \n\n(Eigenmann, 1908), and Oligosarcus argenteus G\u00fcnther, 1864. To determine the \n\nbiological status of them a comparative multidisciplinary approach involving \n\nmorphologic, cytogenetic and molecular data was conducted, with the toothed morphs \n\nand their sympatric species. The toothed morphs showed an intermediate position in \n\nlateral line scale numbers and maxillary teeth number between A. giton and O. \n\nargenteus. Cytogenetic analyses (Giemsa, NOR, C-banding, fluorochromes and FISH) \n\nindicated that all sympatric characids were 2n=50, although they differed from each \n\nother in many other karyotypic characters. The toothed morphs were characterized by \n\nhigh levels of intra and inter-individual chromosomal variation including several \n\nunpairable chromosomes and tiny chromosomes that were not observed in either of the \n\nother sympatric species. Three toothed morphs specimens had their cytochrome b DNA \n\nfragment (475 bp) identical to O. argenteus, with one exception which its cyt. b DNA \n\nsequence was identical to A. giton. Moreover, all toothed morphs ITS-1 DNA sequences \n\nwere characterized by their similitude to those sequences of Oligosarcus argenteus. On \n\nthe other hand, all toothed morphs shared more ISSR alleles with A. giton. The data \n\nsuggested that the toothed morphs were hybrids between A. giton and O. argenteus, \n\nrepresenting the first evidence for spontaneous hybridization between two Neotropical \n\n\n\nxiv \n\n \n\nfish genera.

Such morphological traits have yielded, and will continue to \n\nyield a trove of valuable information pertinent to phylogenetic questions at all levels \n\nwithin the order (Vari 1998). The Characins belong to a large family of freshwater \n\ntropical fishes with roughly eight hundred species recognizable by their adipose fin and \n\ndistinctive teeth in their jaws (Moyle 1995). However, the recent research throws doubts \n\nabout the monophyly of the taxon (Weitzman and Malabarba 1998). The conflicts \n\nbetween cladistics and traditional or phenetic \u201cplacement\u201d of various taxa in the \n\nCharacidae demonstrate that at this time we know little about the relationships of \n\nputative characid subgroups with one another or with other characiform groups. In \n\nconsequence, eighty eight Characiformes genera were listed as Incertae Sedis including \n\n399 Characidae specimens taxonomically poorly known and possibly belonging to \n\ngenera not considered monophyletic (Lima et al. 2003). These mostly small fishes are \n\nabundant in rivers and other aquatic habitats throughout the Neotropical region \n\nincluding the highly speciose Astyanax Baird &amp; Girard (1854) and Oligosarcus G\u00fcnther \n\n(1864) genera. \n\n \n\nGenera Astyanax and Oligosarcus \n\n \n\nAstyanax and Oligosarcus species inhabit heterogeneous environments, as a \n\nresult of the highly complex Neotropical hydrographic history, which favoured several \n\ntectonic processes that resulted in vicariant and dispersal events (Lundberg et al. 1998; \n\nRibeiro 2003). Some lineages could be split, undergo the process of speciation and \n\ndifferentiation between them and later, through random vicariant events, they could be \n\nbrought together again, in secondary contact. \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nAs a dominant freshwater fish genus of South America, Astyanax is found from \n\nPatagonia to the United States, and on both slopes of the Cordilleras. Most of its species \n\nare popularly known as \u201clambaris\u201d or, in the aquarium trade, as \u201ctetras\u201d. This genus was \n\ndescribed by Baird and Girard (1854), in Baird (1859), honouring Astyanax, the son of \n\nHector and considered Astyanax argentatus from riverine streams of Texas as species \n\ntype. Currently, A. argentatus is considered senior synonym to Astyanax mexicanus (De \n\nFilippi, 1853). This genus of tetras is also one of the most studied among Characidae, \n\nwith at least 86 known species (Lima et al. 2003). Recently, more than 20 new species \n\nhave been described (e.g. Bertaco and Garutti 2007; Bertaco and Lucena 2006; \n\nGaravello and Sampaio 2010; Haluch and Abilhoa 2005; Melo and Buckup 2006 among \n\nothers). The complete diagnosis of the genus Astyanax proposed by Baird and Girard \n\n(1854) and followed by Eigenmann (1921) takes into account a combination of \n\nmorphological characters, where the most important are: small size, compressed body \n\nmore or less elongate, rarely reaching a length of 150 mm without ectopterygoid and \n\ncanine teeth, two rows of pre-maxillary teeth, five teeth in the inner pre-maxillary \n\nseries, complete lateral line, presence of adipose fin and naked caudal fin. Unfortunately \n\nthose characters are not diagnostic for Astyanax but widespread among all Characidae \n\ngenera, suggesting the polyphyletic condition of this genus (Weitzman and Malabarba \n\n1998). The complex evolutionary history of Astyanax is closely linked to its headwater \n\nbehaviour. Some geographically isolated fish populations restricted to headwaters of \n\nsome tributaries have been identified all over the large tropical riverine systems and \n\nremain as separated assemblages by physical, chemical or biotic barriers which may \n\nlead to several evolutionary pathways within the same hydrographic system (Lowe-\n\nMcConnell 1969). Doubtfully, all these specimens had the same evolutionary pathways \n\nto the common ancestry. It seems more plausible instead, that their body shape is be the \n\nresult of convergent evolution, or in other words, the body shape similarity is a \n\nhomoplasy. \n\nAnother important Characidae genus is Oligosarcus which is much less \n\nspecious, with only 19 valid species (Menezes 1987; Menezes and Ribeiro 2010; \n\nRibeiro 2007; Ribeiro et al. 2007).Their South American endemic species are found in \n\nthe Parana-Paraguay basin and in coastal streams of eastern and southern Brazil, \n\nUruguay and north-eastern Argentina (Lima et al. 2003). The Oligosarcus species are \n\npopularly known in Portuguese South America as \u201cbocarras\u201d or \u201ccachorras\u201d and in \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nSpanish South America as \u201cdientudos\u201d. G\u00fcnther (1864) considered Oligosarcus \n\nargenteus from the Velhas River Basin as type species for the genus, which was \n\ndiagnosed, among other characters by having: head and body compressed of moderate \n\nsize, oblong and covered with scales; lateral line complete; teeth conical, in a single \n\nseries in the intermaxillary (pre-maxillary), maxillary, mandible (dentary) and on the \n\npalatine bones; presence of canine teeth in the premaxillary and mandible. The \n\nphylogenetic condition of Oligosarcus inside Characifomes has been subject to debate \n\nsince its description. In a first moment Oligosarcus, Paroligosaracus and \n\nAcestrorhynchus genera were clustered together inside the tribe Acestrorhynchini, \n\noutside the family Characidae but in the family Acestrorhynchidae (Menezes 1969). \n\nOligosarcus was placed as the sister taxon of Paroligosarcus pintoi which is \n\ncharacterized by distinct teeth morphology with tri- and penta-cuspid teeth on the \n\nanterior portion of the dentary. Such condition was considered plesiomorphic since all \n\nOligosarcus and Acestrorhynchus species have conical or canine teeth at the anterior \n\ndentary series. However, subsequent osteological data changed Paroligosarcus genus \n\nstatus and placed P. pintoi inside Oligosarcus, now recognized as O. pintoi (Menezes \n\nand G\u00e9ry 1983). \n\nThe osteological review made by Menezes and G\u00e9ry (1983) also revealed that \n\nAcestrorhynchini could not be considered a monophyletic taxa because both \n\nAcestrorhyncus and Oligosarcus have several particular derived characters. A \n\nsubsequent revision analysis made by Buckup (1991) proposed the separation of the \n\ngenus Oligosarcus from Acestrorhinchini and its inclusion in the subfamily \n\nTetragonopterinae (Characidae) because of the absence of the supraorbital bone. Inside \n\nTetragonopterinae, Oligosarcus should also be closely related to Astyanax. The genus \n\nOligosarcus has strong evidences suggesting monophyletic condition, such as the \n\npresence of tricuspid teeth along most of the ectopterygoid length (Ribeiro et al. 2007). \n\nEven so, Oligosarcus was also included in Incertae Sedis (Lima et al. 2003) due to its \n\nunknown phylogenetic relationships with the other Characidae. \n\nDespite the high morphological difference between those two genera, recent \n\nphylogenetic studies place them together as sister groups (Ort\u00ed and Meyer 1997; Castro \n\net al. 2004). Moreover, morphological analysis (e.g. Lucena 1993), and molecular \n\nanalysis (Calcagnotto et al. 2005; Javonillo et al. 2010) suggest that Astyanax is \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nparaphyletic. Javonillo et al. (2010) also include Oligosarcus within \u201cAstyanax\u201d. The \n\nrelationship of both genera with the other groups in Characidae remains unclear (Hattori \n\net al. 2007). These studies do not include all possible mechanisms that could be \n\nresponsible for this confusing relationship between the two genera. \n\n \n\nFish Cytogenetics and Related Concepts \n\n \n\nCytogenetics can be defined as the study of the normal or abnormal chromosome \n\nset and their genetic properties (Griffiths et al. 2004). However the comprehension of \n\nthe mechanisms of genetic changes between chromosomes can never be understood \n\nwithout the cytological point of view of the chromosome set. Chromosomes are part of \n\nliving cells and therefore, part of their mechanical basic principles of growing, \n\nreplicating and dying. As genetic structures each chromosome contains a fragment of \n\nthe code of life and is a keystone on the heritage process. As cytological structures they \n\nobey to all cell rules of mitosis and the even more dramatic meiosis. \n\nUsually, each animal and plant species accounts with its specific chromosome \n\nset \u2013 the karyotype. However a single karyotype, as the number of chromosomes and \n\ntheir specific morphology, may be apparently present in another species. Therefore, \n\nobjective karyological characterization of each species requires several specific \n\nchromosome markers obtained by banding patterns and in situ hybridization. There are \n\nalso cases in which a species or a population cannot be characterized by one single \n\nkaryotype but several variations, called cytotypes. When those variations are numerical, \n\nthey are result of mechanical complications during cell divisions or due to the presence \n\nof supernumerary chromosomes, also called B chromosomes. When the variation is \n\nrelated to the morphology of distinct chromosomes, they could be the result of specific \n\nchromosomal rearrangements. All new rearrangements require the specimens undergo a \n\nheterozygous condition, which generates cytological polymorphisms. There is a strong \n\nevolutionary importance on those polymorphisms. Commonly they are related to \n\nreproductive disorders resultant of meiotic disturbances.  \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\nThe chromosomal heterozygozity condition and its role in the speciation process \n\nhave been largely discussed in the cytogenetics literature. Ernst Mayr considered such \n\nrearrangements as simply a post-speciation afterthought (Kearney and Hewitt 2009). \n\nWhite (1978), however argued that if this were so, we would expect to frequently \n\nencounter the situation where a \u201eyoung? species or semi-species had different \n\nkaryotypes in different parts of its range, without being associated with any genetic \n\nisolation (and this is definitely not the case). Its stasipatric model also proposes that the \n\nheterozygote condition is so deleterious that different mechanisms developed to balance \n\nthe polymorphisms may lead to speciation (Spirito 1998). King (1993) suggests also \n\nthat this homozygous advantage is considered unimportant since several species \n\ndeveloped non-Mendelian modes of segregate two chromosome types in the \n\nheterokaryotype. At present times, several studies suggests that those heterokaryotypes \n\nmay be naturally fixed or not (Barton 2001; Navarro and Barton 2003). What will \n\ndecide their fate inside a natural population, the balance between native chromosomes \n\nand rearranged chromosomes, shall be their selective value to the natural selection \n\n(Kawakami et al. 2011).  \n\nBecause of their sheer numbers and old age as a group, fish are particularly \n\ninformative for genetic, cytogenetic and evolutionary studies. The large amount of \n\ncytogenetic data already obtained for fishes has been useful for improving the \n\nphylogenetic comprehension of the taxon. Such cytogenetic data pointed the existence \n\nof large variability on fish diploid number, ranging from a low extreme value of 2n=16 \n\nin the cyprinodontid, Nothobranchius rachovii, to a high of 2n=168 in the \n\npetromyzontiform lamprey, Petromyzon marinus (Hoar 1979). Interestingly, the diploid \n\nnumber 2n=48 chromosomes can be found throughout several Teleostei (Denton 1973) \n\nleading to the suggestion that this karyotype configuration may represent the ancestral \n\nchromosome complement of all vertebrates (Ohno et al. 1968). In Characiformes the \n\ndiploid numbers vary from 2n = 22 to 2n = 102 (Porto et al. 1992) but the great \n\nmajority, however has chromosome numbers between 2n=40 and 2n=60 (Klinkhardt et \n\nal. 1995). The genus Astyanax is characterized by remarkable karyotypic diversity \n\n(Pazza and Kavalco 2007), including the occurrence of different diploid numbers among \n\nindividuals from allopatric populations pertaining to the same nominal species \n\n(Moreira-Filho and Bertollo 1991). Astyanax species also have their diploid numbers, \n\nranging from 2n=36 in A. schubarti Britski (1964) to 2n=50 chromosomes (Arefjev \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n1990; Moreira-Filho and Bertollo 1991; Morelli et al. 1983; Pazza and Kavalco 2007; \n\nOliveira et al 1988; Portela et al. 1988 and others). However, all Oligosarcus species \n\nstudied cytogenetically have 2n=50 chromosomes (Kavalco et al. 2005) differing only \n\non the morphology of their chromosomes.  \n\nThe ancestral karyotype within the genus Astyanax was likely composed of \n\n2n=50 chromosomes (Pazza and Kavalco 2007) with a large metacentric chromosome \n\npair in the complement (Scheel 1972). However, the huge chromosome variability, both \n\ninter and intra-populational, among Astyanax species suggests the existence for at least \n\nthree groups, also called \u201cspecies complexes\u201d (Moreira-Filho and Bertollo 1991; \n\nFernandes and Martins-Santos 2004). This expression \u201cspecies-complex\u201d refers to cases \n\nwhere two or more species are difficult to define because of their complex patterns of \n\nvariation (Nelson 2006). When levels of variation are studied using cytogenetic tools, it \n\nis common to observe cryptic species instead of species complexes in Neotropical, \n\nfishes, since remarkable differences in chromosomes usually imply unviable breeding \n\n(Kavalco et al. 2009). \n\nGenerally, fish chromosomes are smaller in size than chromosomes in most \n\nvertebrates. The length of the average fish chromosome is between 2 and 5 \u00b5m. Many \n\nspecies possess numerous small chromosomes of 2\u00b5m or less, but which are nonetheless \n\neasily seen using the light microscope. Very large chromosomes of 15-30\u00b5m in length, \n\nsuch as those in the lungfish, Lepidosiren paradoxa (Ohno et al. 1968) are rare. On the \n\nother hand, extremely small chromosomes, the so called microchromosomes, were also \n\nreported in primitive species (Ohno et al. 1969). These authors also suggest that \n\nalthough microchromosomes could have arisen independently at the reptilian stage of \n\nvertebrate evolution, their presence in these relict fishes imply that microchromosomes \n\nwere already present in ancestral fish.  \n\nEach pair of homologous chromosome is assumed to differ genetically from all \n\nother chromosome pairs in the same cell. Manifestations of some of these differences \n\ncomprise the morphological \u201cphenotype\u201d or karyotype and include differences between \n\nchromosome pairs in relative size, shape, and centromere position. Sturtevant wrote in \n\n1925 that for a geneticist, many of the comparisons between karyotypes from different \n\nspecies would seem of little significance, because to him (geneticist) it is not the shape \n\nand size of chromosomes which are important, but the genes contained in them. Such \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\u201cgene master importance\u201d view was later abandoned when a better comprehension of \n\nthe nature of chromosomes became available. One of these findings was the discovery \n\nof the position effect, when the same gene may have different functions or activities \n\nwhen placed in different places of the same chromosome. Another relevant aspect was \n\nthe existence of the crossing over mechanism in spreading genetic variability produced \n\nby each individual throughout the population. As a result of a long history, karyotypic \n\ndifferences among species or taxa are routinely used to determine phenetic similarities \n\nand to infer phylogenetic relationships (Gold 1979). \n\nSporadic events of polyploidy in natural populations resulting in natural \n\ntriploidy have been detected in a considerable number of specimens from unrelated \n\nspecies in genus Astyanax. Out of nine cases of natural triploidy reported for tropical \n\nfish, five occurred in species of this genus (Almeida-Toledo et al. 2000). The higher \n\nincidence of triploidy in Astyanax may be due to the diversified environments in which \n\nthese fish live, with greater exposure to abrupt changes in temperature (Fauaz et al. \n\n1994). These recurrent triploids are probably derived from the fertilization of unreduced \n\negg cells, possibly originating from thermal shocks that may have occurred during \n\nfertilization thus disturbing the second meiotic division (Almeida-Toledo et al. 2000).  \n\nIn fish cytogenetics the chromosomes usually are arranged following the \n\nnomenclature proposed by Levan et al. (1964). This nomenclature is based on the \n\nposition of the centromere on the chromosome and four morphological chromosome \n\ncategories have been erected: metacentric (m), submetacentric (sm), subtelocentric (st) \n\nand telocentric (t). There are another two categories almost never used on cytogenetic \n\nstudies: metacentric (M), when the centromere is positioned exactly on the middle of \n\nthe chromosome suggesting symmetry; and telocentric (T), when the chromosome has \n\nonly one arm. There is a great discussion about the true nature of the so called \n\ntelocentric (T) and its arm absence. White (1954), affirms that telocentric chromosomes \n\nwith a truly terminal centromere do not occur naturally, they could be the result of \n\npoorly fixed materials that lead the small arm to merge with the larger one. In \n\nconsequence, he coined the term \u201cacrocentric\u201d to avoid confusion with the term \n\n\u201ctelocentric\u201d where acrocentric chromosomes should be those chromosomes with the \n\nterminal centromere followed by a small arm. In other words, acrocentric chromosomes \n\nare the same of the telocentric (t) chromosomes from Levan et al. (1964). However, \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nLevan et al. (1964) proposed this classification \u201cbased on morphologic observations \n\nrather than theoretical hypothesis\u201d and so, \u201cchromosomes in which no second arm can \n\nbe seen should be designed telocentric, until evidence to the contrary may come \n\nforward\u201d. The current refinement of cytogenetic techniques and the use of high quality \n\nequipment for obtaining chromosome pictures have made it possible to see small arms \n\nthat where invisible in the past. Thus, the correct classification of one species? \n\nchromosomes should incorporate the cytogenetic theory of the chromosome structure: \n\nall stable eukaryote chromosomes have at least, two telomeres and one centromere.  \n\nThe importance of the chromosomal telomeric region is paramount. Since the \n\ndecade of 30?s, Muller stated that the loss of this region would lead to the fusion of the \n\nbroken chromatid to another (Muller 1932). Furtheremore, he suggested that \n\nchromosomes with natural ends are capable of indefinite survival in the course of \n\nsuccessive cell divisions, while the ones with broken ends are not (Muller and \n\nHerskowitz 1954). To Muller, the ends of the natural chromosome ends (which he \n\ncalled telomeres) are self-perpetuating structures that are unable to persist on an \n\ninterstitial position in the chromosome. \n\nAnother fundamental chromosome structure, the centromere, is a region that \n\nenables the accurate partition of newly replicated sister chromatids between daughter \n\ncells during mitosis and meiosis. Although the functional role of the centromeres is \n\nmost evident at metaphase and anaphase they are permanent as autonomous segments of \n\nchromosomes which can be seen at other stages of the cycle in suitable material (White \n\n1954). The centromere holds the sister chromatids together and through its centromere \n\nDNA-protein complex, known as the kinetochore, binds to spindle microtubules \n\nbringing accurate chromosome movements (Dobie et al. 1999). In addition, centromeres \n\nregulate the progression of cell cycle and are critical in sensing completion of \n\nmetaphase. They also trigger the onset of anaphase (Nasmyth 2002). The satellite DNA \n\nthat surrounds the centromere structure is usually A-T rich but adenines or timines are \n\nnot randomly distributed within the sequence. The periodic distribution of A-T tracts \n\nnormally induces curvature of the DNA helix axis and the formation of tertiary \n\nstructures to form a super helix (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). Such a structure is thought to be \n\nimportant for the tight packing of DNA and proteins in heterochromatin (Ugarkovic \n\n2009). \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nThe remarkable importance of both centromere and telomeres on chromosome \n\nstructure and dynamics is clear, and seems completely unlikely that they can occupy the \n\nvery same place on the chromatin. The idea of having telocentric chromosomes (T) \n\nwhere the centromere is placed at the telomeric end of the chromosome cannot prevail. \n\nWith few exceptions, all chromosomes have a centromere and two arms with telomeres \n\non their edges. This basic concept has a key role on fish phylogeny by means of \n\ncytogenetic data since different karyotypes are compared taking into account their \n\nFundamental Number (FN). Matthey (1945) used the term nombre fondamental (N.F.) \n\nto indicate the number of major chromosome arms in a species, counting each \n\nmetacentric as two arms and each telocentric as one. This concept must be carefully \n\nused as a proportion of the telocentric chromosomes among the other chromosomes of \n\nthe karyotype, where each telocentric has the value (1) and the other kinds of \n\nchromosomes has the value (2). Several citations mentioning \u201cbi-armed\u201d and \u201cone-\n\narmed\u201d chromosomes can be found on fish cytogenetical literature and they should be \n\navoided. It must be stated that, in natural conditions, all chromosomes are \u201cbi-armed\u201d. \n\n \n\nPhenotypic Plasticity and Heterochrony \n\n \n\nThe heterogeneous environments inhabited by Astyanax and Oligosarcus \n\nspecimens may be closely connected to the huge morphological variation found among \n\ndifferent specimens of each genus. High degrees of speciation itself may be an \n\nimportant consequence to these peculiar Neotropical fresh waters. Phenotypic plasticity \n\nis rarely mentioned in the literature even though it plays a major role in the diversity of \n\nthe morphs (Romero and Green 2005). The array of phenotypes developed by a \n\ngenotype over an array of environments is genetically variable and its capacity for \n\nplasticity is therefore subject to natural selection (Pigliucci 2001). Those individuals \n\nwith a heritable higher capacity to express specific adaptive traits under appropriate \n\nconditions can be expected to be favoured by natural selection. Phenotypic plasticity \n\nprovides reproductive advantage over genetically fixed phenotypes because \n\nenvironmentally induced phenotypes have higher probabilities of fitting to prevailing \n\nenvironmental conditions than genetically fixed ones (Whiteman 1994). Perhaps the \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\nmost common \u201cmechanism\u201d for developmental plasticity is heterochrony. The term was \n\ncoined by Haeckel in 1875 and indicates a variety of alterations in the rate or timing of \n\ndevelopmental events, resulting in an array of peramorphic (overdeveloped) or \n\npaedomorphic (juvenilized) forms of descendants (Gould 1977). There is still some \n\narguing on the heterochrony definition and West-Eberhard (2003) suggested that it is \n\nnot a \u201cmechanism\u201d of evolution and like duplication, deletion and reversion; it should \n\ndescribe a kind of variation that has become established during a cross-generational \n\ntransition, a change in the phenotypic composition of a population or species. In other \n\nwords, heterochrony should not be interpreted as a cause of such changes. \n\nNotwithstanding, the genetic variation responsible for these \u201cshifts\u201d is poorly \n\nunderstood yet, the heterochronic shift concept has been useful in trying to understand \n\nhow morphological differences between homogeneous taxa could have originated \n\n(Schichnes and Freeling 1998). Goldschmidt (1938; 1952) proposed that all mutations \n\nproduce a change in some developmental step which occurs at a definite time and stage \n\nof development as well as in a definite region of the embryo. This author also suggested \n\nthat chromosomal rearrangements remain as an important process able to generate \n\nhypothetical macromutations that may cause large-scale evolutionary changes in a \n\n\u201csaltational\u201d way. Later, Fink (1982) emphasized the necessity of phylogenies to \n\npolarize directions of heterochronic change between species. There are currently three \n\ncharacteristics of the development of organs and organisms which are subject to \n\nheterochronic change: onset, rate and/or offset, and they embrace the essential \n\ncomponents of any change in development: growth, allometry, scaling and functional \n\nadaptation. It is important to state that when invoking heterochrony it is critical to \n\ndemonstrate that one or other of onset, rate and offset has been altered in a descendent \n\nrelative to the condition in an ancestor (Hall 1999). Heterochrony is a valuable concept \n\nbecause it links development and evolution in fairly understandable ways and therefore, \n\nits application as the main explanation for so much evolutionary change must be made \n\ncarefully since it seems unlikely that this process is a predominant mode of evolutionary \n\nchange (Thomson 1988). The genetic mechanisms of heterochrony are not well \n\nunderstood yet however, it seems that they are more connected to genetic expression \n\nthan to the presence or absence of specific genes. An increasing number of papers have \n\nshown how shifts in the relative timing of onset or offset of particular genes \u2013 genetic \n\nheterochrony - may produce significant phenotypic change (e.g. Smith 2003). This link \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nof molecular genetics with the classical heterochrony mystery is providing a clear bound \n\nbetween microevolutionary processes and macroevolutionary changes. The \n\npaedomorphic features in fish are commonly referred to as reductive and considered to \n\nbe due to the loss of terminal stages in the developmental sequence (Weitzman and Vari \n\n1988). Miniaturization of the body is commonly reported among different vertebrate \n\ngroups. The phenomenon of miniaturization is a phylogenetic statement, implying that \n\nthe group under consideration evolved from a larger ancestor. The body size is among \n\nthe most important determinants of species function and ecological role. However, the \n\nbroad significance of miniaturization for organismal biology and evolution, including its \n\nhigh frequency among major groups of animals, has been largely unappreciated \n\n(Hanken and Wake 1993). Miniaturization involves not only small body per se, but also \n\nthe consequent and often dramatic effects of extreme size reduction on anatomy, \n\nphysiology, ecology, life history and behaviour (Peters 1986). There are some costs and \n\nalso some compensation on size decrease. In freshwater fishes, a standard length of 25-\n\n26 mm has been used as the maximum size for miniature species (Weitzman and Vari \n\n1988) and this represents one-fourth to one-fifth the average size of living teleosts \n\n(Helfman 2009). At least 85 species of South American freshwater fishes are regarded \n\nas miniature, representing 5 orders, 11 families and 40 genera (Weitzman and Vari \n\n1988). The reduced and simplified adult morphology that characterizes many \n\nminiaturized taxa often bears a strong resemblance to sub-adult or even embryonic \n\nstages of larger close relatives. This resemblance typically is the primary evidence used \n\nto define the morphology of many miniaturized species as paedomorphic and as having \n\nevolved via precocious truncation of the ancestral developmental program (Gould \n\n1977). The rates of morphological variability are also connected to the body size \n\ndecrease and novel morphological features are readily tied to it since the novelty may \n\nlie, in part, on the effect of size reduction in a morphogenetic way (Hanken 1985). \n\nNovelty associated with miniaturization may be responsible for distinctiveness in newly \n\nestablished clades and can be reinforced by the parallel or convergent evolution of \n\nsimilar, if not identical, modifications in disparate lineages that have evolved small size \n\n(Hanken and Wake, 1993). The genus Astyanax is characterized by high phenotypic \n\nplasticity and a capacity to adapt to diverse habitats (Strecker et al. 2003). There are \n\nclear evidences of relatively fast adaptations of these fish to new habitats and \n\nenvironments, with ecological specialization and morphological differentiation. The \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\ncommonest adaptation is related to the body shape and have been demonstrated that \n\npopulations inhabiting fast-water streams usually have elongated body shapes (Haluch \n\nand Abilhoa 2005). Considerable attention has been given to the evolution of \n\ndevelopmental mechanisms and adaptation to cave environments (Protas et al. 2007). \n\nCahn (1958) carried out the first detailed comparative analysis of eye development in \n\nAstyanax surface fish and cavefish showing, by means of histological data, that embryos \n\nof both populations actually develop a primordial eye, which gradually disappear during \n\nlarval stage. Her work has been confirmed several times (Behrens et al. 1997; Jeffery et \n\nal. 2003). The cavefish eye actually develops normally for a considerable length of time \n\nbefore finally disappearing due to failure to keep up with the overall body growth \n\n(Jeffery 2005) what indicates a clear ontogenetic misfit between the eye and the body \n\ndevelopment. The epigean and the hypogean species also differ on their feeding \n\napparatus: the hypogean species has larger jaws with 3-4 teeth in the maxillary bone \n\nwhereas the epigean one has only 1-2 teeth on that bone. Jaw modifications are \n\naccompanied by larger maxillary bones which ossify earlier during cavefish \n\ndevelopment, an example of heterochrony. These modifications have converged in \n\ndifferent cavefish populations and are likely to be under the influence of strong selective \n\npressure (Jeffery 2001). \n\nIn fact heterochrony and homoplasy interconnect in the case of paedomorphic \n\nparallelism, in which related clades in essence back down (in a phylogenetic sense). \n\nTherefore, the morphological similitude between different phylogenetic groups of \n\nNeotropical Characidae should be analysed carefully by means of plasticity and \n\nheterochrony morphological concepts since these fish are grouped by their \n\nmorphological plesiomorphies and questioned by their molecular divergences.  \n\n \n\nHybridism \n\n \n\nThe mechanisms responsible for generating the enormous biological diversity \n\nhave received paramount attention from naturalists. Among them, the natural process of \n\nhybridization has been studied by men since earlier ages. Aristotle himself studied cases \n\nof hybridism among dogs and foxes and partridge and common chicken. He had \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\ndifficult to explain, however, the sterility of the mule. For him, hybrids do not \n\nnecessarily truly breed \u2013 after several generations of interbreeding, they supposed to \n\neventually revert to the female appearance, just as seeds of plants come to vary \n\naccording to the soil on which they grow (Anton and Preus 1992). Hybridism is a major \n\nasset to all works that intend to understand what a species is, because a single hybrid \n\nspecimen represents the living proof of the breakage of main barriers that keep different \n\nspecies apart. Owing to the gradualness of the speciation process one should find in \n\nnature, populations that are on the way to becoming separate species, but have not yet \n\nquite completed the process. Such \"semi-species\" are indeed found (Mayr 1999). The \n\n\u201cidea of species\u201d is a major reference framework for virtually all subfields of biology \n\nsciences, mainly due to its importance in systematics (Queiroz 2005). Related to that \n\nrelevance, hybridism occupies a central position to those who try to unveil the nature of \n\nthe species concept. As a consequence, the definition of hybridization is as difficult as \n\nthe definition of species. One of the striking phenomena of recently formed hybrid \n\npopulations is their tremendous variation. Both parental types, as well as all the possible \n\nrecombinations of the parental characters, may be found in the same effective breeding \n\npopulation (Mayr 1999). The difficulty of delimiting the term \u201chybridization\u201d against \n\nthe various forms of intraspecific interbreeding have been warned by Mayr (1999) who \n\nsuggested that the use of this term is undoubtedly justified only if individuals of \n\ndifferent families, genera or \u201cgood species\u201d interbreed. Hybrids differ from individuals \n\nof the parental species not only in morphology but usually also in fertility and viability \n\n(heterosis). Zoologists have tended to see hybridization as a problem for taxonomy: \n\nshould populations that remain distinct despite genetic exchange be considered \n\nmembers of the same species (Barton 2001)? Even those who developed the biological \n\nspecies concept (Dobzhansky 1953; Mayr 1966) regarded gene flow through animal \n\nhybrid populations as ineffective; hybrid zones were seen as being either transient, with \n\nnatural selection reinforcing mating preferences to give fully isolated species, or if \n\nstable, merely as obstacles to further divergence. Most hybrids present problems to \n\nproduce the normal number of viable gametes, a biological response to hybridism called \n\n\u201chybrid sterility\u201d. Sterility may range from slight to complete and it is not necessarily \n\ncorrelated with a reduction in viability (Mayr 1966). The complex problem that \n\nAristotle firstly found with the mule sterility raised several concerns about the main \n\ncausative reasons for hybrid sterility. A fundamental discovery concerning hybrid \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\nsterility was made by Federly (1913) who suggested that the chromosomes usually fail \n\nto form bivalents at meiosis in sterile and semi-sterile hybrids in consequence of several \n\nabnormalities observed on their spermatocytes. This link between abnormalities in \n\nspermatocytes and hybrid sterility led Dobzhansky and Beadle (1936) perform an \n\nelegant experiment transplanting larvae testes between hybrids of Drosophila and pure \n\nspecies. They confirmed that the sterility is connected to the hybrid spermatogenesis \n\nsince the gonads of the pure species develop and work normally on hybrid specimens. \n\nThe key role of hybrid sterility led Theodosius Dobzhansky (1953) to pioneer the \n\ngenetic study of speciation, by mapping its main responsible genetic factors. He also \n\ncreated the view that speciation represents the transformation of within-population \n\nvariation into between-taxa differences through the evolution of inherent reproductive \n\nisolating barriers. Indeed, chromosomal incompatibilities are strongly connected to \n\nhybrid sterility however, Bateson (1909), Dobzhansky (1936) and Muller (1940; 1942) \n\nindependently discovered that the main reasons for those incompatibilities, even among \n\nspecies with similar karyotypes, are the epistatic deleterious interactions between \n\ndifferent sets of complementary genes. Hybridization, therefore, indicates relationship, \n\nbut it should be stated emphatically, that the degree of sterility observed in the hybrids \n\ndoes not indicate the degree of relationship (Mayr 1999). \n\nCharles Darwin himself recognized that cross-fertilization results, in many \n\nsituations, in higher biological vigour than crosses between inbred specimens within the \n\nsame species (Gowen 1952). The term heterosis, or hybrid vigour, is used to \n\ncharacterize the increased function of any biological quality in a hybrid offspring. In \n\nother words, it is the occurrence of a genetically superior offspring from the \n\ncombination of distinct parental genes. The heterosis phenomenon is also the opposite \n\nof the inbreeding depression caused by endogamy (Falconer 1987). Actually, the only \n\nframe of reference which makes the concept of heterosis meaningful is the greater \n\nfitness or adaptive value of the progeny compared with that of the parents (Dobzhansky \n\n1949). However, there is an open question about how this combination can actually \n\nproduce an increase in the fitness of the heterozygote, as compared to both \n\nhomozygotes, since the characters favoured by natural selection are the result of several \n\ngenes in heterozygous condition (Buzzati-Traverso 1952). The genetic mechanisms \n\nwhich produce heterosis are different in each case. Since most mutations arising in any \n\ngiven species are deleterious, and since in outbred species, deleterious dominant \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\nmutants are eliminated by selection more rapidly than recessive ones; the populations \n\naccumulate stores of concealed variability which consist mainly of deleterious recessive \n\nvariants (Dobzhansky 1949). Taking this idea into account two theories, which are \n\ncompeting but not mutually exclusive, try to explain heterosis: the dominance \n\nhypothesis suggests that the hybrid vigour is a consequence of interactions between \n\ndominant favourable genes. Therefore, the heterozygosis condition is not essential for \n\nheterosis (Cruz 2005; Davenport 1908). On the other hand, the overdominance \n\nhypothesis suggests that the vigour originates from certain combinations of alleles, \n\nattributing heterosis to the heterozygosis (Shull 1908). It seems that to the \n\ncomprehension of species evolution and speciation, the overdominance hypothesis \n\nremains more plausible. Dobzhansky (1949) also suggests that heterosis is caused by the \n\nspecific interaction effects of gene complexes which have emerged in the process of \n\nevolution under a controlling influence of natural selection. Therefore, the likely \n\nalternative to explain the increased vigour of hybrids between natural populations is due \n\nto certain gene loci, where the heterozygote is superior to either homozygote, and due to \n\ngene interactions (Crow 1948). Among natural populations, fitness varies smoothly with \n\ngenotype because of the interaction of many genes with large numbers of alleles with \n\nsmall effect (Barton 2001). The vast genetic database obtained from Drosophila strains \n\nalso seems to corroborate the overdominance hypothesis (Dobzhansky 1950; Muller and \n\nFalk 1961). Studying natural populations of Drosophila in Central America, \n\nDobzhansky and Pavlovsky (1955) found in Honduras a D. tropicalis population with \n\nhigh proportions of heterozygotes for a specific inversion in the second chromosome \n\nthat lead the homozygous progeny to death in egg or larval stages on every generation. \n\nHowever, even sacrificing about one-half of its zygotes in every generation, the fitness \n\nof the heterotic heterozygotes is so high that the population is considered by the authors \n\na \u201cflourishing one\u201d. Heterosis is in short, a form of evolutionary adaptation, \n\ncharacteristic of sexually reproducing and cross-fertilizing species: heterosis is, \n\ntherefore, a result of natural selection (Dobzhansky 1949; 1953). \n\nAt least four kinds of factors (ecological, ethological, mechanical and genetic) \n\nparticipate in preventing the production of hybrid individuals between sympatric \n\nspecies. The mere fact that such hybrids occur indicates that some of the isolating \n\nmechanisms may broke down (Mayr 1999). An important outcome of hybridization is \n\nthe introgression of the gene pool of one taxon (eg. species) into another taxon. When \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\nthe hybridization involves a rare taxon, Arnold (1997) suggests three important results: \n\nincrease of its fitness; addition of genetic variation; and the construction of a reservoir \n\nof parental-like genotypes/phenotypes. Barton (2001) suggests that even if those \n\nbarriers get broken the hybrid fitness frequently drops when compared to their parents?. \n\nHowever, the increase in variability still remains the key. Actually few hybrid \n\ngenotypes might be fitter than the parental ones because only the hybrid specimens have \n\nsome degree of gene interaction. It is unlikely that the fittest possible gene combination \n\nwould occur in the pure lineage of either parental species (Turelli et al. 2001). If hybrids \n\nare capable to survive the competition with their parents, with all their problems, they \n\nmust be able to hit new adaptive combinations of genes (Mallet 2007). The \n\nintrogression event is considered a spontaneous consequence of hybridization by Mallet \n\n(2005) who suggests that the first (F1) hybrid should be the most difficult to produce \n\nbecause they are result of a singular event: closely related and diverging species living \n\nin sympatry; once they are produced the backcrossing to one of the parental lineage is \n\nmuch more straightforward. Barton (2001) also shares this point of view and says that if \n\nfertile F1 hybrids are produced these will almost certainly backcross to one or other \n\nparental genotype because of their variability. The possibility of introgression, or not, \n\nwere taken into account by Allendorf et al. (2001) who categorized hybridization in six \n\ndistinct types whereas the last three types are the result of anthropogenic work: 1) \n\nnatural hybrid taxon; 2) natural introgression; 3) natural hybrid zone; 4) hybridization \n\nwithout introgression (F1 sterile); 5) widespread introgression (recent hybridization \n\ngeographically restricted); 6) complete admixture (when conservation actions fail and \n\nall populations become hybrid swarms). \n\nIt is sometimes argued that intraspecific hybridization should not be a concern \n\nbecause populations of the same species generally share alleles so that new genetic \n\ntypes that might cause outbreeding depression will not be created by introgression \n\n(Keenan 2000). Moreover, it was suggested that the anthropogenic introduction of new \n\ngenetic variation into a population, by a process called supplementation, could generally \n\nbe beneficial and provide genetic variation so that natural selection can increase the \n\nfitness of populations (Cuenco et al. 1993). This seems absurd since each population has \n\nits own and characteristic gene pool. By introducing alien genes in a threatened \n\npopulation the true result shall be the complete extinction of the original population and \n\nthe rise of a new population but with different gene pool. The impact of introduced \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\nspecies or lineages is widely known by their negative effects on the natural species by \n\ncompeting with or preying on them or destroying their habitat (Gurevitch &amp; Padilla \n\n2004). However the extinction by hybridization and introgression with the introduced \n\nspecies on native fauna is a serious menace too (Allendorf et al. 2001; Orr 1998; \n\nRhymer and Simberloff 1996). Since a hybrid has unusual gene combinations its \n\nadaptive value, if compared to its parents, is unpredictable. By means of introgression \n\nand gene exchange two well adapted and natural populations could drastically change \n\ntheir gene pools with severe consequences to their fitness (Dowling and Hoeh 1991; \n\nDowling et al. 1989), and usually, the introgressant genes predominantly flow from the \n\ncommon to rarer species (Allendorf et al. 2001). Introgressive hybridization may have \n\nbeen a persistent feature of the adaptive radiation through most of natural history, \n\nfacilitating evolutionary diversification and occasionally affecting both the speed and \n\ndirection of evolution (Grant et al. 2005). However the predatory behaviour of human \n\nkind makes almost impossible to consider, nowadays, hybridization and introgression as \n\npure natural processes. Therefore, it is complicated to distinguish natural and \n\nanthropogenic hybridization (Allendorf et al. 2001; Dowling and Secor 1997), and this \n\nis central feature for conservation biology. When this distinction is not achievable, the \n\nalternative is to either not allow protection of natural hybrids or to protect \n\nanthropogenic hybrids that could contribute to extinction of parental species and waste \n\nlimited resources available for conservation. The most widely known case relating \n\nhybridism and environmental biology is that of the problematic red wolf (named Canis \n\nrufus) which wasted great amounts of preservation resources when, actually, it was not \n\na natural species but a hybrid of the grey wolf (Canis lupus) and the coyote (Canis \n\nlatrans) (Wayne &amp; Gittleman 1995). This hybridization event was strongly associated \n\nwith the extensive agricultural cultivation of the southern United States by European \n\nsettlers beginning around 250 years ago (Reich et al. 1999). The hybridism problem is \n\nso serious among conservationists that several pejorative connotations for introgression \n\nwere published as: \u201ccontamination\u201d, \u201cinfection\u201d, \u201cgenetic deterioration\u201d, \u201cgenetic \n\npollution\u201d, \u201cgenetic aggression\u201d and others (Rhymer and Simberloff 1996). \n\nNatural hybridization is believed to be more common in fishes than on other \n\ngroup of vertebrates (Mayr 1966), and moreover, non-native fish species have been \n\nintroduced extensively worldwide (Smith 1992).The largest fish hybrid database reports \n\nthe existence of at least 3.759 natural and artificial cases of hybridization (Schwartz \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\n1972; 1981). This amount, however, should be currently much larger. Several groups of \n\nfishes from western United States exhibit evidence of past introgression, implicating a \n\ngeneral causative factor. Ecosystems of this region have gone through dramatic change, \n\nincluding considerable tectonic activity and progressive aridification. This process had \n\nsevere impact on aquatic ecosystems, likely producing cycles of isolation and sympatry \n\n(Dowling and Secor 1997). Man-caused habitat changes in North America have also \n\nbeen correlated with hybridization between both previously allopatric and sympatric \n\npairs of species and sympatric species that rarely or never hybridize in nature and \n\nhybridize freely in laboratory conditions (Hubbs 1955). Several characteristics of fish \n\nspecies may account for their ease to hybridize: external fertilization, weak ethological \n\nisolating mechanisms, unequal abundance of the two parental species, competition for \n\nlimited spawning habitat, and susceptibility to secondary contact between recently \n\nevolved forms (Campton, 1988). The data of Neotropical hybrid fish species is scarce \n\nand only four cases are known for the family Characidae. The first one is related to the \n\nblind tetra Astyanax jordani and A. mexicanus (Kullander 1999). Two other cases \n\ninvolve fish species from Serrasalmus genus, also called piranhas. In one case the \n\ncytogenetic data suggested the hybridism between two isolated populations of \n\nSerrasalmus spilopleura (Cestari and Galetti Jr. 1992). Hybridism in piranhas has also \n\nbeen studied by Hubert et al. (2007; 2008) between Serrasalmus compressus and S. \n\nhollandi in a sympatric population of Madeira River. The fourth case of hybridism was \n\ndocumented for two different sympatric populations of Astyanax fasciatus with distinct \n\nchromosome configuration (Pazza et al. 2006). All four documented cases of hybridism \n\namong Characidae species involve crossing between close species or different \n\npopulations from a same species and therefore a hybridism between different genera or \n\nhigher taxa have never been discussed. However, it must be stated that hybridization \n\nmay be strongly underestimated when we consider that many pairs of species are only \n\nweakly diagnosable using morphology (Mallet 2008). The major importance of \n\nhybridism events to Characidae fish is that the instable phylogenetic situation of the \n\nspecies belonging to the Incertae Sedis group may be the result of several horizontal \n\ntransferences among different genera that once lived in sympatry. As the phylogenetic \n\ninvestigations of this group suggest absence of monophyly for distinct groups, the event \n\nof introgression should be taken into account as an explanation when phylogenetic trees \n\ninferred from different genes are in conflict (Baak and Rieseberg 2007). \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\nFinal Aspects \n\n \n\n The relationship between the Characidae genus Astyanax and Oligosarcus is \n\ncomplex under the scope of phylogenetics and when morphologically intermediary \n\nspecimens are discovered several hypothesis must be raised for the correct \n\nunderstanding of the biological processes that made those specimens rise in sympatry. \n\nSuch intermediary characteristics may be the result of random heterochronic variations \n\non A. giton or O. argenteus leading to morphologic changes. However, they also may be \n\nresultant of hybridism between those two sympatric species. Each hypothesis has \n\ndistinct biological implications and phylogenetic impact for the Characidae fish and \n\ntherefore, the conclusion must be carefully taken. The more tools available to unveil this \n\nmystery, the best explanation for this biological incident is possible to reach. When \n\nmorphology, cytogenetics and molecular biology techniques are combined to detect the \n\nvariability of these morphologically distinct specimens and used to contrast these \n\nmorphological variants with the other sympatric species, the results suggests that the \n\nhybridism hypothesis is more plausible. However, all knowledge about both hypotheses \n\nis always necessary for conclusive affirmations about this case that may be able to \n\nanswer several questions about the relationship of the different Characidae groups. The \n\nresults of these techniques and their main conclusions are discussed on the following \n\nchapter.  \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\nBibliography  \n\n \n\nAllendorf FW, Leary RF, Spruell P, Wenburg JK (2001) The Problems of Hybrids: \n\nsetting conservation guidelines.

Within this family, the closely related \n\ngenera Astyanax and Oligosarcus are represented by small sized fishes that are an expressive \n\nproportion of the freshwater biodiversity in many rivers of South America. In the Doce River \n\nBasin, South-eastern Brazil, 5 characid specimens \u201ctoothed morphs\u201d with unusual \n\nmorphology were analysed with morphological, cytogenetic and molecular techniques and \n\ncompared to the sympatric characids Astyanax bimaculatus, Astyanax giton and Oligosarcus \n\nargenteus. The toothed morphs showed an intermediate position in lateral line scale numbers \n\nand maxillary teeth number between A. giton and O. argenteus. Cytogenetic analyses \n\n(Giemsa, NOR, C-banding, fluorochromes and FISH) indicated that all sympatric characids \n\nwere 2n=50, although they differed from each other in many other karyotypic characters. The \n\ntoothed morphs were characterized by high levels of intra and inter-individual chromosomal \n\nvariation including several unpairable chromosomes and tiny chromosomes that were not \n\nobserved either in A. giton or O. argenteus. Two toothed morphs had their cytochrome b \n\nDNA fragment (475 bp) identical to O. argenteus but one toothed morph had its sequence \n\ncompatible to the A. giton species. However a different picture can be seen at the nuclear \n\nDNA where all toothed morphs had their ITS1 DNA sequence (1123 bp) similar to O. \n\nargenteus including the specimen with distinct mtDNA. Moreover, all toothed morphs shared \n\nmore ISSR alleles with A. giton, than to O. argenteus. The data suggested that the toothed \n\nmorphs were hybrids between A. giton and O. argenteus, representing the first evidence for \n\nspontaneous hybridization between two Neotropical fish genera. The relevance of such \n\nfindings in conservation biology and phylogeny assessment was discussed.  \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\nThe Neotropical freshwater ichthyofauna is remarkably rich and diverse (Schaefer \n\n1998). The order Characiformes has more than 1600 species in 16 families (Reis et al. 2003) \n\nincluding the family Characidae, which include the popular tetras. The Characidae are \n\nwidespread throughout American continent, from south Texas to Patagonia (Eigenmann \n\n1921), and are very common both in lotic or lentic waters. This family has not been \n\ndiagnosed as a monophyletic group (Weitzman and Malabarba 1998). The conflicts between \n\ncladistic and traditional phenetic approaches in Characidae demonstrate that at this time we \n\nknow little about the relationships of putative characid subgroups with one another or with \n\nother characiform groups (Weitzman and Malabarba 1998). Such uncertainty led to the \n\ninclusion of a great number of genera from the Characidae family to the Incertae Sedis \n\ncondition (Lima et al. 2003) including the genera Astyanax and Oligosarcus.  \n\nMacroevolutionary processes may be the historic outcome of microevolutionary \n\ndynamics (Ridley 2004), a level that is gauged by the patterns of variation in natural \n\npopulations. At the population level, processes such as migration and gene flow (or even \n\nhybridization) may superimpose to genetic drift and divergence. Horizontal transfer has been \n\nfrequently reported among North American and Old World freshwater fishes (Schwartz \n\n1972), but there is little information on spontaneous hybridization between Neotropical \n\nspecies. A survey in a headwater dam in the Lat\u00e3o Creek, a tributary of the Doce River Basin, \n\nyielded 5 Astyanax-like fish with numerous maxillary teeth (ca. 8-13) which are hereafter \n\nreferred as the toothed morphs. Lima (1998) collected one single specimen with few similar \n\ncharacteristics at Paraiba do Sul river basin. Unfortunately the author only commented the \n\nsimilitude of this specimen to Astyanax and Oligosarcus without any discussion of its origin \n\nand suggested the creation of a new genus for this single specimen. In Sossego?s dam, these \n\ntoothed morphs are sympatric with Astyanax bimaculatus (Linneaus, 1758); Astyanax giton, \n\nEigenmann, 1908 and Oligosarcus argenteus, G\u00fcnther, 1864. These three species are easily \n\ndistinguished morphologically. To determine the biological nature of these \u201ctoothed morph\u201d \n\nfishes, it was conducted a comparative multidisciplinary approach including morphologic, \n\ncytogenetic, and molecular data, on the toothed morphs and on the other sympatric species. In \n\nthe last decades, the combined application of these independent character sets has allowed to \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\naddress whether populations or individuals belong to different species or not. Morphological \n\ncharacters allow determining the possible uniqueness of the toothed morphs, their similarity \n\nto any of their sympatric species or, in the case of hybrids, an intermediate condition between \n\ntheir putative parental species (Hubbs 1955; Welsh and Cincotta 2004). Cytogenetic data \n\nhave also been quite instrumental to characterize the biological nature of problematic \n\nspecimens, because it is well known that related species have chromosomal differences (King \n\n1993; White 1978). Finally, uniparental loci, such as mitochondrial DNA are excellent \n\nmarkers for characterizing new taxa (reciprocal monophyly) or for detecting genetic \n\nhorizontal transfer events (hybridization). However, under such circunstances nuclear genetic \n\nmarkers such as the ITS regions may be more suitable for this kind of investigation since they \n\nevolve fast but with the effects of the concerted evolution what minimizes the degree of \n\nintraspecific variation, and make the ITS regions suitable for phylogenetic comparisons \n\namong closely related taxa (Chow et al. 2006; Presa et al. 2002). Additionaly, rDNA genes \n\nare recombining, biparental markers, which can reveal recent gene flow and hybridization \n\nevents (Mayer and Soltis 1999, Sang et al. 1995). Moreover, multilocus markers, as ISSR, are \n\nefficient to determine the similarity of genotypes between species. They are also good \n\nmarkers for identifying different sympatric groups characterized by chromosome \n\npolymorphisms in a given Characidae population (Pazza et al. 2007). The possibility of \n\nhybridism and introgression between Characidae species may help the phylogenetic \n\nunderstanding of this unsolved group of South American freshwater fishes. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\nMaterial and Methods \n\n \n\nCharacterization of the study area and overall proceedings \n\n Specimens were collected at a dam in the headwaters of Lat\u00e3o Creek, in the \n\nMunicipality of Coimbra (20\u00b051'24\" S, 42\u00b048'10\" W) in the state of Minas Gerais (Fig. 1). \n\nThe Lat\u00e3o Creek is a tributary of the Piranga River, within the Doce River Basin. The dam \n\nwas built in 1978 and has approximately 2 ha. A multiple (morphologic, cytogenetic, and \n\nmolecular) approach was used to compare the toothed morph (Fig. 2) to the other sympatric \n\nspecies (Table 1): Astyanax bimaculatus (Linnaeus 1758), Astyanax giton Eigenmann, 1908 \n\nand Oligosarcus argenteus G\u00fcnther, 1864. After the cytogenetic and molecular protocols, all \n\nspecimens were fixed in 10% formalin, transferred to 75% alcohol, and deposited in the \n\nichthyological collections of Zoology Museum of the Universidade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa (Minas \n\nGearis, Brazil) and PUC-RS (Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil).  \n\n Morphometric protocols. Morphometric measurements were carried out using a \n\nmanual 0.05 mm precision calliper, and characters followed Eigenmann (1921). Sixteen traits \n\nwere taken from each specimen: standard length/head (HEAD), standard length/maximum \n\nbody depth (DEPTH), head/eye (EYE), head/interorbital distance (IO), head/snout \n\n(SNOUT), free margin of maxillary bone/anterior-posterior length of the pre-maxillary \n\n(FMM), head without operculum/free maxillary border (PMMB), total dorsal fin rays (D), \n\ntotal anal fin rays (A), number of scales between dorsal fin and lateral line (D-LL), number \n\nof scales on lateral line (LL), number of scales between pelvic fin and lateral line (P-LL), \n\nteeth on the front pre-maxillary row (TFR), teeth on the inner pre-maxillary row (TIR), teeth \n\non the maxillary (TM) and teeth on the dentary bone (DENTARY). Morphometric and \n\nmeristic data were subject to principal component analysis (PCA) by correlation (normalized \n\nvar-covar) data matrix since the variables are measured in different units (morphometrical \n\nand meristical). The analysis were carried out using the software PAST v. 2.01 (Hammer et \n\nal. 2010). The jaw bones from A. bimaculatus, A. giton, O. argenteus and the toothed morph \n\nwere also subject to Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) using a LEO SEM model \n\n1430VP.  \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\n Cytogenetic protocols. Cell division was stimulated in vivo with 2 daily applications \n\nof Imunovac\n\u00ae\n, a commercially available solution of different kinds of antigens following \n\n(Molina 2001; Molina et al. 2010). Fish were previously anesthetized with clove oil \n\naccording to Henyey et al. (2002) and somatic metaphases were obtained from kidney cells \n\nby the \u201cair drying\u201d method of Egozcue (1971) and modified by Bertollo et al. (1978). \n\nTechniques included Giemsa staining, C-banding according to Sumner (1972) and combined \n\nwith DAPI staining (Swar\u00e7a et al. 2003); sequential fluorochrome with CMA3/DAPI \n\nfollowed Schweizer (1976) and Sola et al. (1992). The Nuclear Organizer Regions (NORs) \n\nwere detected by silver staining method (Howell and Black 1980). Fluorescent in situ \n\nhybridization (FISH) followed Pinkel et al. (1986) with 18S and 5S probes from Hoplias \n\nmalabaricus (Cioffi et al. 2009) and Leporinus elongatus (Martins and Galetti 1999) \n\nrespectively. Chromosomes were classified in metacentrics (m), submetacentrics (sm), \n\nsubtelocentrics (st) and telocentrics (t) following Levan et al. (1964). Digital images were \n\ncaptured on Olympus BX 60 microscope using Q color 3\n\u00ae\n Olympus software and the \n\nchromosomes were measured using Image Pro Plus\n\u00ae\n. The chromosomes were assembled in \n\nkaryotypes using Corel Photopaint X4\u2122 and Adobe Photoshop CS2\n\u00ae\n. \n\n Molecular protocols The DNA extraction followed Boyce et al. (1989) and was \n\nconducted on 28 specimens: 10 specimens of Oligosarcus argenteus, 1 specimen of \n\nOligosarcus paranensis Menezes and G\u00e9ry, 1983, 10 specimens of Astyanax giton, 1 \n\nspecimen of Astyanax bimaculatus from the Sossego Dam, 1 specimen of Astyanax \n\nbimaculatus from Tiririca Lake (19\u00b045?S; 42\u00b027?W), and the 5 toothed morphs. For mtDNA \n\nanalysis, a 475 bp fragment of cytochrome b was sequenced, using primers GLU-5 (Table 2) \n\n(Hillis et al. 1996). Double stranded DNA was synthesized in 50 ?L reactions containing 10 \n\n?L dNTPs (1 mM), 5 ?L reaction buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.4, 500 mM KCl), 2 ?L \n\nMgCl2 (50 mM), 2 ?L of each primer (10 mM), 0.5 ?L (2.5 U) of Taq DNA polymerase \n\n(Phoneutria), 2 ?L of template DNA (100 ng/?L) and 26.5 ?L of H2O. PCR conditions were \n\nas follows: 94 \u00b0C (2 min), 5 cycles of 94 \u00b0C (45 s), 54 \u00b0C (45 s), 72 \u00b0C (1,5 min), 29 cycles of \n\n94 \u00b0C (45 sec), 58 \u00b0C (45 s), 72 \u00b0C (1,5 min). PCR products were purified using Qiaquick \n\n(Qiagen) and were sequenced in Macrogen Corp., South Korea. The sequences were aligned \n\nusing CLUSTAL W as implemented in MEGA 4.0 (Tamura et al. 2007) and the analysis was \n\nperformed using Neighbour Joining (NJ) (Saitou and Nei 1987). \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\nInternal Transcribed Spacers (ITS). Nucleotide sequences of a conserved primer pair \n\n(ITS1 and 5.8S) used to amplify the ITS1 region were obtained from Duke University web \n\nsite (http://www.biology.duke.edu/fungi/mycolab/primers.htm). The forward primer (ITS1) \n\nwas designed to anneal near the 3' end of 18S rDNA, and the reverse primer (5.8S), to anneal \n\nnear the 5' end of 5.8S rDNA (Table 2). The ITS1 sequence was amplified using Taq \n\npolymerase Phoneutria\u00ae with GC buffer which considerably improved amplification over \n\nstandard Taq protocols. Initial denaturation at 96 \u00baC for 2 min, was followed by 25 cycles of \n\namplification (denaturation at 96 \u00baC for 0-5 min, annealing at 58 \u00baC for 0-5 min and extension \n\nat 74 \u00baC for 1 min) with a final extension at 74 \u00baC for 10 min. Six specimens of Oligosarcus \n\nargenteus, five specimens of Astyanax giton and four toothed morphs were subjected to the \n\nprevious protocol. A. bimaculatus was discarded as a possible parental. \n\nCloning ITS fragments. The amplification products were purified directly from a \n\n1,5% agarose gel by using Kit Wizard \n\u00ae\n SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (PROMEGA) \n\nand bounded to Vector pGEM\n\u00ae\n-T Easy Vector System (PROMEGA) following the \n\nmanufactory?s suggestions. The vectors were applied to transform ultracompetent DH5a E. \n\ncoli cells. The transformant clones were selected by alpha-complementation, and the \n\nrecombinant transformant by plasmid extraction through fast colony lysis. The transformant \n\nclones were selected, multiplied and the recombinant plasmids were extracted and purified by \n\nthe usage of the S.N.A.P. Miniprep Kit from INVITROGEN \n\u00ae\n, as suggested by the \n\nmanufactory. The purified plasmid was submitted to sequencing by automatic sequencer \n\nmodel MegaBACE (GE-Healthcare) with M13 oligonucleotides specific to the utilized \n\ncloning vector. The partial amplification products were purified with the Enzyme mix Exo-\n\nSap-IT\n\u00ae\n (USB corporation) and directly sequenced with the same oligonucleotides used in \n\nthe amplification process. \n\nInter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) protocols. After A. bimaculatus was discarded \n\nas a putative parental, ISSR amplification was used in the 2 remaining species and the \n\ntoothed morphs, to estimate the nuclear DNA similarity of the toothed morphs. Twelve ISSR \n\nprimers (UBC primer set # 9, Biotechnology Laboratory, University of British Columbia, \n\nCanada) were assayed in a pilot test on randomly chosen individuals of A. giton and O. \n\nargenteus and the toothed morphs. Different concentrations of several reaction components \n\nand annealing temperatures were tested. Three primers produced strong bands and were \n\nevaluated further for ISSR polymorphism (Table 2). PCR amplifications were carried out in a \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\ntotal volume of 20 \u00b5L comprising 20 ng template DNA, 2.0 \u00b5L 10X PCR buffer, 2.5 mM \n\nMgCl2, 0.2 mM each dNTP, 2% formamide, 0,2 \u00b5M primer, 0,75 U Taq DNA polymerase \n\n(Phoneutria) and ultrapure water. PCR amplification was programmed on MJ Research PT \n\n100 as follows: a denaturation step at 94 \u00baC, 45s annealing at 45 \u00baC -53 \u00baC, 90s extension at \n\n72 \u00baC followed by 7 min extension at 72\u00ba C. Amplification products were separated via \n\nelectrophoresis on 6% (w/v) polyacrilamyde gels with 1X TBE buffer at constant voltage \n\n(100v) for approximately 4-6 hours. Amplified fragments were identified using a 1 kb DNA \n\nLadder (Invitrogen). Bands were visualized with silver nitrate. ISSR bands were treated as \n\ndominant genetic markers and scored as 1 (present) or 0 (absent) binary characters. Only \n\npolymorphic bands that could be unambiguously scored across all the surveyed individuals \n\nwere considered for further analysis. The resulting data matrix was analysed using TFPGA v. \n\n1.3 (Miller 1997) for UPGMA, by means of Nei`s (1972) original distance. The analysis was \n\nused to construct a phenogram representing the genetic distances among each sample. \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\nResults \n\n \n\n Morphological data. Most of the morphological patterns of variation placed the \n\ntoothed morphs in an intermediate position between A.giton and O. argenteus. The method of \n\nprincipal components (PCA) is a procedure for finding hypothetical variables (components) \n\nwhich account for as much of the variance in multidimensional data as possible (Harper \n\n1999). These new variables are linear combinations of the original variables. This method \n\nappears to have useful application to analysis of fish hybrids, partly because it is free of the \n\ndisadvantages of the hybrid indices and discriminant functions (Smith 1973). Astyanax \n\nbimaculatus, Astyanax giton and Oligosarcus argenteus were characterized by diagnostic \n\nmorphology and meristic patterns (Table 3; Fig. 3). The toothed morphs and the two species \n\nof Astyanax lacked the ectopterygoid teeth series that characterize O. argenteus. The \n\nmaxillary teeth number and morphology characterized each of the species at the Sossego?s \n\nDam: A. bimaculatus lacked such teeth, A. giton were characterized by low numbers (0-3) \n\nand hexacuspid and pentacuspid teeth, O. argenteus had the highest number (15-26) of \n\ntricuspid and conic maxillary teeth; and toothed morphs had high numbers (8-13) of \n\npentacuspid and tricuspid teeth (Table 4; Fig. 4). Toothed morphs also differed in the number \n\nof lateral line scales and the dentary tooth number from the other two species (Table 3). \n\n \n\n Cytogenetic data. All three species and the toothed morphs shared the same diploid \n\nnumber of 2n=50 chromosomes (Fig. 5). The chromosome morphology, however, was \n\ncharacteristic for each species (Table 5). The four toothed morphs showed high levels of \n\nchromosome variation both within and among individuals (Fig. 6). Unique chromosome \n\nmorphologies were observed, including a large submetacentric and tiny acrocentrics or \n\nmetacentrics. Most of these chromosomes lacked homologues and were placed in a special \n\ngroup (Fig. 6; Table 6); a trend that was particularly evident to the toothed morph CT 2214, \n\nwhich showed 2n=51 in more than half of the analysed metaphases, suggesting the modal \n\ndiploid number for this specimen was 2n=51 (Table 6). The most stable karyotypic formula \n\nwas observed in the individual CT 1945 and therefore the cytogenetic results of the remaining \n\ntoothed morphs were referred to it (Table 7).  \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\nAmong the three species and the toothed morph, Astyanax bimaculatus showed the \n\nhighest level of karyotypic divergence. Its C-banding/DAPI pattern showed pericentromeric \n\nheterochromatin in sm and st chromosomes (Fig. 7a), while Giemsa-stained C-banding \n\nshowed heterochromatic blocks at the pericentromeric region of only one pair of \n\nsubmetacentric chromosomes (Fig. 7b). Two non-homologous chromosomes (st and t) \n\nshowed silver stained blocks (Fig. 7c-d), and the location of some heterochromatic blocks \n\nmatched the silver-stained regions. These chromosomes also presented CMA3 fluorescence, \n\nbut the subtelocentric chromosome had a marking at its short arm instead of the telomeric \n\nregion of its long arm (Fig. 8a-b). The 5S rDNA FISH probe also showed a mark on the \n\ntelomeric region of the long arm of a telocentric chromosome and also on the telomeric \n\nregion of the small arm of a subtelocentric chromosome. (Fig. 8c). The 18S FISH probe \n\nhybridized with 10 m, sm and st chromosomes (Fig. 8c). The few pericentromeric marks \n\nseemed equivalent to the heterochromatin blocks identified using the C-banding technique.  \n\nIn A. giton, the C-banding/DAPI showed multiple heterochromatic markings, most of \n\nthem on the small arms of submetacentric and subtelocentric chromosomes (Fig 7e). A faint \n\nmarking was also found on the centromeric region of the largest metacentric chromosome. \n\nThe C-banding technique showed heterochromatin only on four chromosome pairs including \n\na large subtelocentric chromosome showing bitelomeric markings (Fig. 7f). All Giemsa-\n\nstained C-banding matched 18S rDNA fluorescence patterns, although this probe also showed \n\nadditional markings at telomeric portions of the largest metacentric pair (Fig. 8f). The Ag-\n\nstained metaphases showed two different small chromosomes of subtelocentric morphologies \n\nas NOR bearers (Fig. 7g-h). Also, only one pair of chromosomes was marked with the 5S \n\nrDNA probe (Fig. 8f). The small difference between the two chromosomes marked with \n\nsilver was not evident with the CMA3 fluorochrome staining (Fig. 8d-e).  \n\nThe karyotype of O. argenteus was also characterized by high numbers of telocentric \n\nchromosomes. The technique of both C-banding and C-banding/DAPI sequential yielded \n\nsimilar patterns (Fig. 7i-j). A pair of small subtelocentric chromosomes seemed to carry a \n\nheterochromatic block on their small arms, and only one chromosome from the largest \n\nmetacentric pair presented heterochromatin block on the distal region of their long arms. The \n\nnucleolar organizer region was located in the small arm of a pair of medium sized \n\nsubtelocentric chromosomes (Fig. 7k-l). The 5S rDNA cluster was also located on the small \n\narm of a pair of subtelocentric chromosomes. (Fig. 8i). All 18S rDNA clusters (Fig. 8i) were \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\nassociated to CMA3 marks (Fig. 8g-h), except for the heterochromatic block at the distal long \n\narm of the larger metacentric chromosome. Also, a pair of large subtelocentric chromosomes \n\ncarried two 18S rDNA clusters in both telomeres, a bitelomeric marking that was not shown \n\nby CMA3 staining, restricted however to the long arm of one of its homologues and to the \n\nshort arm of its counterpart.  \n\nFinally, for the toothed morphs, the C-banding (Giemsa and DAPI sequential stain) \n\nshowed only faint markings (Fig. 7m-n) on telomeric region of a submetacentric chromosome \n\nsmall arm and, also on the interstitial region of the long arm of a single telocentric \n\nchromosome. Two NOR sites were located on a pair of subtelocentrics (Fig. 7o-p). Only one \n\nchromosome pair carries the 5S rDNA region as confirmed by the FISH technique (Fig. 8l). \n\nCMA3 and 18S rDNA FISH coincided for same regions in 4 chromosome pairs (Fig. 8j-k). \n\nThe only exception was the telomeric 18S rDNA cluster on the larger metacentric \n\nchromosome, which was not evidenced with CMA3. This toothed morph was characterized \n\nby relatively few subtelocentric chromosomes, a condition shared with O. argenteus but its \n\nkaryotype also included a unique feature: the presence of a large pair of telocentrics, its 19\nth\n\n \n\nchromosome pair that represented roughly two thirds of the first chromosome pair. None of \n\nother studied species had such a large telocentric chromosome pair. The toothed morphs were \n\ncytogenetically unique since their karyotypes showed diverse variations (Fig. 6). There were \n\nalso remarkable differences between the banding patterns of these sympatric species and the \n\ntoothed morph specimen (Table 7). \n\n \n\nMolecular data. The cytochrome b mtDNA fragment was identical in three of the \n\ntoothed morphs and the sympatric O. argenteus and thus, the Neighbour Joining analysis \n\nclustered the toothed morph specimens as closely related to the genus Oligosarcus. However, \n\nthe toothed morph CT 2213 clustered with the Astyanax giton branch (Fig. 9). The ITS-1 \n\nfragments showed similar results of the mitochondrial sequence, though the toothed morphs, \n\nincluding CT 2213, clustered with the Oligosarcus instead of the Astyanax branch (Fig. 10). \n\nMore than one sequence was obtained for the toothed morph CT 2213 and Astyanax giton CT \n\n2093 as a result of the multiple genomic ITS sequences extracted from nuclear DNA. In the \n\nISSR analysis, ten marker loci were obtained distinguishing A. giton and O. argenteus where \n\nthe toothed morphs remained as mosaics between these two species. The UPGMA \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\n \n\nphenogram of the ISSR matrix clustered O. argenteus and A. giton in two different groups \n\n(Fig. 11), while the toothed morphs formed a distinct group within the A. giton group. \n\nThe relationship between the haplotypes of A. giton, O. argenteus and the toothed \n\nmorphs may be related to introgressive hybridization and also to ancestral polymorphism \n\n(Dobzhansky 1953; Wu et al. 2011). If the observed degree of mtDNA sequence variation \n\nfound among these three Sossego?s groups can also be found among other species from both \n\nAstyanax and Oligosarcus genera, the pattern of variation should be related to ancestral \n\npolymorphisms. In order to determine which kind of relationship can be related to the \n\nmtDNA variation obtained in the sympatric A, giton and O. argenteus specimens, a mtDNA \n\ncomparison including Astyanax bimaculatus and Oligosarcus paranensis species was made \n\n(Fig. 12). The analysis showed that the toothed morphs clustered with Oligosarcus solitarius \n\nand Oligosarcus paranensis in a distinct branch of that one of Astyanax giton and Astyanx \n\nbimaculatus. Therefore, the mtDNA relatedness found among A. giton, O. argenteus and the \n\ntoothed morph should not be associated with commom ancestral polymorphisms.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\nDiscussion \n\n \n\n The PCA pattern indicates the intermediate character of the toothed morphs between \n\nA. giton and O. argenteus. Besides these general morphological aspects, the morphology of \n\nthe maxillary teeth was also informative. Cusp morphology in toothed morphs included \n\ntricuspid teeth (typical of O. argenteus) and pentacuspid teeth (characteristic of A. giton). \n\nMoreover, the toothed morphs showed two rows of pre-maxillary teeth \u2013 a trait not shared \n\nwith any known Oligosarcus specimen. Many studies indicate that hybrid fish are \n\nmorphologically intermediate between the parental morphotypes (Hubbs 1955). However, in \n\nother cases many hybrid characters show a range of patterns of nonadditive inheritance \n\n(Smith 1992). With respect to some traits, a hybrid may fall well outside the range of parental \n\nmorphological variation. Such traits are said to be heterotic and may result in cases where the \n\nhybrids exceeds the range of variation exhibited by its parents (positive heterosis) or when \n\nhybrids fall below the range of parental variation (negative heterosis) (McCarthy 2006). \n\nWithin the hybrid genome, different alleles can interact following two main hypotheses: the \n\ndominant hypothesis, which has enjoyed long theoretical support, posits that deleterious \n\nrecessive alleles are complemented in hybrids by fitter alleles from the alternate parent, \n\ngenerating a possible increase in vigour. In contrast, the overdominance hypothesis attributes \n\nhybrid vigour to the synergistic interactions of alleles at a heterozygous locus (Baak and \n\nRieseberg 2007). Here, success depends on the fixation of favourable new gene combinations \n\nfrom the two parental species (Barton 2001). There is no doubt that the combination of two \n\ndifferent genotypes may result on unique phenotypes not present on the parental species. The \n\nBateson-Dobzhansky-Muller theory states that the sterility of hybrids is related to the \n\nepistatic interactions between gene clusters of each parent (Bateson 1909; Dobzhansky 1936; \n\n1953; and Muller 1940; 1942) and remains as a classic example of how singular \n\ncombinations can be found only in hybrid specimens but not on the parental lineage. Through \n\ndominance effects, some traits were expressed more similar to A. giton and others to O. \n\nargenteus (such as absence of palatine teeth). Some traits, on the other hand, showed \n\nintermediate condition between both putative parental, such as the maxillary teeth. These \n\ntoothed morphs are therefore distinct from the specimen described by Lima (1998) at the \n\nParaiba do Sul River basin mainly due to the absence of ectopterygoid teeth and the presence \n\nof pentacuspid teeth at the maxillary. \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\n \n\nThe cytogenetic data suggested a mixed suite of A. giton and O. argenteus characters \n\nin the toothed morphs. The toothed morph CT 1945, characterized by a more conservative \n\nkaryotype, had an unusual banding pattern. All banding techniques when combined provided \n\nthe identity of each group of Sossego?s dam and therefore represent good markers. The \n\nspecies A. bimaculatus possesses the most distinctive pattern characterized by two non-\n\nhomologous chromosomes bearing the Ag-NOR clusters. The C-banding/DAPI shows ten \n\nchromosome pairs with heterochromatin blocks, several of them located at the \n\npericentromeric region. However, the most informative data is the location of 5S-rDNA \n\nclusters. Only A. bimaculatus has two chromosomes pairs bearing this kind of rDNA. The \n\nspecies A. giton similarly to A. bimaculatus has several chromosomes carrying \n\nheterochromatin blocks and only two chromosomes marked with CMA3. However \n\ndifferentiates of A. bimaculatus by having a single pair of chromosomes carrying the 5S-\n\nrDNA clusters, instead of two. Oligosarcus argenteus possesses a clear divergence of that \n\npattern shown by these two Astyanax species since he presented only few chromosomes \n\nmarked by C-Banding/DAPI technique and 6 chromosomes marked by the CMA3 technique. \n\nThe main distinctive character is the presence of only 8 chromosomes carrying 18S rDNA \n\nclusters, instead of 10 chromosomes as seen in these sympatric Astynax species. The toothed \n\nmorph presented a mixed suit of markers and therefore unique. The C-banding (both Giemsa \n\nand DAPI stained), NOR banding and CMA3 banding patterns were closer to O. argenteus \n\nthan to A. giton. However, the 18S FISH pattern was very similar to the pattern seen in A. \n\ngiton. On the other hand, 5S FISH markings were conserved, exactly as in A. giton and O. \n\nargenteus.  \n\nThe karyotype of A. giton from Sossego?s dam was also different from that already \n\ndescribed for a population in Paraiba do Sul River basin, distinguishing only by the \n\ndifference between the proportion of subtelocentric and telocentric chromosomes, where the \n\nA. giton population from Sossego has 12 subtelocentric chromosomes pairs and the \n\npopulation from Paraiba do Sul River basin has only 4 subtelocentric chromosomes. \n\nMoreover, both populations presented, in the majority of their individuals, a single pair of \n\nchromosomes Ag-NOR marked and 10 chromosomes baring the 18S rDNA clusters (Kavalco \n\nand Moreira-Filho 2003). Unfortunately the authors did not pointed the location of such 18S \n\nclusters in the karyotype. The illustration, however, show that the main difference between \n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n\n \n\nthese two populations is the lack of the chromosome pair which bears the 18S rDNA on both \n\ntelomeric regions.  \n\nThe lack of cytogenetic data about O. argenteus complicate any comparison between \n\ndifferent populations of this species. Paiva (2008) described the karyotype of O. argenteus \n\nfrom S\u00e3o Bartolomeu River (also a tributary of Turvo River) which differed from the Sossego \n\npopulation only in the number of metacentric and subtelocentric chromosomes, but they share \n\nthe same Fundamental Number. The O. argenteus population of S\u00e3o Bartolomeu River \n\npresented 4m+16sm+14st+16t and the population from Sossego was characterized by \n\n6m+16sm+12st+16st. Moreover, the S\u00e3o Bartolomeu population showed several \n\nheterochromatic blocks at the telomeric regions of different chromosomes, where one pair \n\npresented the bitelomeric mark. The karyotype of O. argenteus from Sossego was poorer on \n\nsuch heterochromatic blocks, but it counts with the bitelomeric mark on a large \n\nsubmetacentric chromosome. Also, it was found by Paiva (2008) that the specimens from S\u00e3o \n\nBartolomeu River have two chromosome pairs bearing the Ag-NORs, contrasting with the \n\nsingle chromosome pair bearing the Ag-NOR for specimens from Sossego?s dam. The pattern \n\nof O. argenteus from another geographically close riverine system, the Casca River, was also \n\ninformative. The individuals from that locality presented 10 chromosomes carrying the 18S \n\nrDNA clusters (including a chromosome with 18S rDNA clusters on both telomeric regions) \n\n(Barros, unpublished data). This is a remarkable difference between these two close \n\npopulations of O. argenteus. Since in Sossego Oligosarcus argenteus is the only species with \n\n8 chromosomes bearing the 18S rDNA clusters, the rDNA configuration of that closest \n\nriverine population may suggest the uniqueness of the Oligosarcus from Sossego. \n\nA population of Oligosarcus macrolepis (Steindachner 1877), studied by Falc\u00e3o and \n\nBertollo (1985) collected from the Turvo River (Rio Doce basin) had similar karyotypes of \n\nthat described in the present work except for differences between submetacentric and \n\nsubtelocentric chromosomes. The karyotype described by Falc\u00e3o and Bertollo (1985) was \n\ncharacterized by 6m+22sm+6st+16t. \n\nIn lower vertebrates, NORs can be evidenced not only by silver staining but also by \n\nGC-specific fluorochromes such as chromomycin A3 and mithramycin. The great advantage \n\nof using fluorochromes is that it is possible to identify the 45S clusters of the NOR, \n\nindependent of their activity (Schmid 1980; Schmid and Guttenbach 1988). Ag-NORs in the \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\n \n\ngenus Oligosarcus present an intra-and interspecific variation in number and a remarkable \n\nsize heteromorphism in some populations (Kavalco et al. 2005). However, when the number \n\nof 18S rDNA markers are the same, the disturbances obtained through the ag-NOR technique \n\nshould be linked to variations on the expression of the rDNA and the specific proteins \n\nconnected to these active regions (Miller et al. 1976). \n\nThe 5S rDNA multigene family consists of a highly conserved coding sequence of \n\n120bp forming arrays of several tandem copies, which are kept separated from each other by \n\nvariable non-transcribed spacers (NTS) (Danna et al. 1996). This kind of rDNA gene is a \n\nsmaller DNA sequence that does not participate in the formation of the nucleolus (Peres et al. \n\n2008). In several organisms, the 5S rDNA genes appear strongly constrained to only one \n\nchromosome pair, while NORs are often present in multiple chromosomes (Suzuki et al. \n\n1996, M\u00e4kinem et al. 1997). The 5S clusters may also occur in more than a single \n\nchromosome pair (Martins and Galleti-Jr 1999) as exemplified by a population of A. giton \n\nwith several chromosomes bearing the 5S clusters (Kavalco et al. 2004). The 5S rDNA \n\nclusters presents a different pattern of variation among fish species. Since the sequences of \n\nthe 45S and 5S rDNA genes remained greatly conserved during the evolution of fish \n\n(Fujiwara et al. 1998; Martins and Galleti-Jr 2001), these sites may constitute important \n\ncytotaxonomical markers in this group (Garcia and Moreira-Filho 2008). To the present data, \n\nunfortunately, the 5S rDNA cluster represented a good marker only to identify A. \n\nbimaculatus since all other sympatric characids presented a single pair of chromosomes \n\nbearing those ribosomal genes. On the other hand A. giton from Sossego and Para\u00edba do Sul \n\nRiver basin populations are highly different because the first population has a single pair of \n\nchromosomes bearing the 5S clusters and the second  population counts with 10 \n\nchromosomes carrying such genes (Kavalco et al. 2004). It seems highly improbable that all \n\nthese divergence is connected only to Robertsonian chromosomal rearrangements. Despite \n\nthe number of 5S rDNA clusters remains as good markers to distinguish these two \n\npopulations, they should not be used to characterize A. giton. \n\nThe morphological aspects of the chromosomal structure among the four karyotyped \n\ntoothed morphs revealed the wide range of variation characteristic of some fish hybrids \n\n(LeGrande et al. 1984). All toothed morphs presented several degrees of chromosomal \n\nabnormalities by possessing numerous chromosomes unable to be paired including tiny \n\nchromosomes, of metacentric and telocentric morphology. The toothed morph CT 2214, \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\n \n\npresented an additional small chromosome in more than a half of its cells. Chromosome \n\nvariability with mitotic origin is not a novelty, and several variations (mainly in \n\nheterochromatic blocks) were documented in many vertebrates, invertebrates and plant \n\nspecies (Kurnit 1979). The chromosome heterozigosity among kangaroo hybrid species \n\nsuggested to O?Neill et al. (2001) that the chromosome rearrangements found in such hybrids \n\ndo not occur randomly.  Such variability may be explained by the concept of specific \n\nchromosomal territories inside the nucleus as proposed by Boveri (1909). It is currently \n\naccepted that the chromosomes are not randomly displayed inside the nucleus, but organized \n\nin specific chromosome territories that are essential components of the higher-order \n\nchromatin architecture of the vertebrate cell nucleus (Tanabe et al. 2002; Tashiro et al. 2007). \n\nSuch arrangements have several implications on gene expression and chromosome evolution. \n\nIt has been argued that heterochromatin blocks may play a role in the evolving nuclear \n\narchitecture (Dechat et al. 2008; Manuelidis 1990), such as position of genes relative to the \n\nheterochromatin, which may strongly affect their transcription (Baxter et al. 2002; Lanct\u00f4t et \n\nal. 2007). The CT-IC cytogenetic model states that the positioning of genes into proper \n\nnuclear compartments is an essential part of gene-activation and gene silencing mechanisms \n\n(Cremer and Cremer 2001). Chromosome translocations that join heterochromatin segments \n\nwith gene-dense chromatin segments may therefore lead to radial chromatin shifts depending \n\non the size and composition of the respective segments (Tanabe et al. 2002). Not surprisingly, \n\nevery subtle change on the position of some chromosome fragments (e.g. Position Effect) \n\nmay have several and unpredictable phenotypic results. Hybridization can result in genomic \n\nchanges including alterations to gene expression, chromosomal structure, and genome size \n\n(Baak and Rieseberg 2007). In the toothed morphs, hybrid somatic cells containing sets of \n\nchromosomes belonging to each parental may face a complex condition for each chromosome \n\nposition inside the nucleus, which may result in non-random interaction between \n\nchromosomes inside the interphasic nucleus. According to John (1980), the occurrence of \n\nrearrangements involving homolog chromosomes is a rare event. Baak and Rieseberg (2007) \n\nsuggest that in hybrid cells the karyotypic differences may arise through the sorting of \n\nchromosomal rearrangements that distinguish the parental species or may arise de novo. \n\nChromosome fission or Robertsonian translocations may be responsible for the additional \n\nchromosome that characterized toothed morph CT 2214. The presence of high chromosome \n\nmosaicism on this specimen suggests that the rearrangements involved occurred late in the \n\nembryonic development (O?Neill 2001). Such chromosome instability in somatic cells may \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\n \n\nbear phenotypic implications. Gene incompatibility of the parental species may lead to severe \n\nor lethal physiological disturbances, as reported for hybrids of crosses between the close \n\nswordfish species Xiphophorus maculatus and Xiphophorus helleri. These hybrids frequently \n\ndevelop melanotic tumours (Mayr 1966). Similar incompatibilities of the parental genomes \n\nhave been described for species crosses in a number of animal and plant genera (Ghadially \n\nand Gordon 1957; Mayr 1966) and may lead to reductions on fertility capacity (Dobzhansky \n\n1953; Garagna et al. 2002). However, this concept of hybridization as an evolutionary dead-\n\nend in animals is being challenged by reports of frequent hybridization between closely \n\nrelated species (Avise 1994; Barton and Hewitt 1989). These chromosomal rearrangements, \n\nmainly inversions, in hybrid swarms have their remarkable importance when carrying \n\nadvantageous traits, which may lead to quickly fixation in the population (Stemshorn et al. \n\n2011) \n\nMitochondrial DNA has been widely used in evolutionary studies because of its \n\nuniparental mode of inheritance, high rate of evolution, and ease of isolation and \n\ncharacterization (Moritz et al. 1987) and some mitochondrial genes could be used as \n\nphylogenetic markers to resolve relationships among taxa that diverged as long as 65 to 300 \n\nmillion years ago (e.g., Ort\u00ed and Meyer 1997). On the other hand, the biparental way of \n\ninheritance of ITS sequences is advantageous when compared to the uniparental inheritance \n\nof organellar DNAs (Feliner and Rosell\u00f3 2007) since the concerted evolution of tandem \n\nrepetitive families, such as rDNA, make them useful in phylogenetic studies as a result of the \n\nhomogenization of the variation within species and populations, whereas divergence is \n\nstressed between them (Hillis and Dixon 1991; Nei and Rooney 2005; Separack et al. 1988). \n\nThe fast evolution of such sequences generates great amount of variability and when \n\nconcerted evolution is not fully operating, duplicated ribosomal loci do not necessarily \n\nremain functional and some arrays may degenerate into pseudogenes (Feliner and Rosell\u00f3 \n\n2007). The inter-simple-sequence-repeats (ISSR) have applications in studies of population \n\nstructure, parentage, individual identification, and may be used for studies of hybridization \n\n(Scribner et al. 2001). The three molecular approaches indicated different aspects of the \n\ntoothed morphs genetic background, suggesting a matrilineal O. argenteus origin and a closer \n\nnuclear allelic identity to A. giton. The specimen CT 2213 represents the main clue that the \n\ntoothed morphs are indeed hybrids since its matrilineal origin lies on Astyanax giton and its \n\nnuclear ITS-1 DNA is similar to those of Oligosarcus argenteus specimens. In the ten ISSR \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n\n \n\nloci that were considered good markers for A. giton or O. argenteus, the toothed morphs \n\npresented intermediary characters for nine loci. The degree of variance found among the \n\npaternal A. giton contribution is surprising, considering the rarity of male specimens of A. \n\ngiton at Sossego?s Dam (Table 1).  \n\nHybrid occurrence is a common phenomenon among fishes, especially in fresh water \n\nones (Hubbs 1955) and Schwartz (1972; 1981) reviewed 3,759 references related to fish \n\nhybridization. Several factors have been proposed as possible causes for the high incidence of \n\nhybridization among closely related fish taxa: external fertilization; weak behavioural \n\nisolating mechanisms; unequal abundance of the two parental species; competition for limited \n\nspawning habitat; and susceptibility to secondary contact between recently evolved forms \n\n(Hubbs 1955; Scribner et al. 2001); anthropogenic habitat alterations and introduction of \n\nexotic species may also be current relevant factors (e.g., Welsh and Cincotta 2004). Smith?s \n\n(1992) revision indicates three main assumptions on fish hybridization literature: 1) the \n\nlikelihood of hybridization and the fertility of hybrids are proportional to genetic similarity \n\n(Hubbs 1955), which is condemned by Mayr (1999). Genetic compatibility between species \n\ncan be considered a plesiomorphic trait that may or may not be blocked by subsequent \n\nevolution; 2) hybridization and introgression are promoted mainly by anthropogenic \n\ndisturbance of habitat integrity, \u201chybridization of the habitat\u201d (Miller et al.1989). Fossil and \n\nmolecular evidences suggest, however, that hybridization has occurred in ancient as well as \n\nin modern times (Smith 1992). Anthropogenic disturbances are recent additions to normal \n\ngeological, climatic and ecological modifications of habitats; 3) some assumptions on fish \n\nhybridism suggest they are \u201cintermediate\u201d between the parental morphotypes (Hubbs 1955). \n\nHowever some observations and experiments indicate, to the contrary, that diverse characters \n\nshow a range of patterns of nonadditive inheritance as commented above.  \n\nFour cases of spontaneous hybridism have been reported for Characidae fish, but they \n\nwere either inferred and/or are restricted to the same nominal species. One of them is the \n\nblind troglodyte Astyanax jordani and the epigean species Astyanax mexicanus, as a result of \n\nsympatry when specimens of the latter species become trapped in caves with A. jordani \n\n(Kullander 1999). Pazza et al. (2006) reported two sympatric strains of A. fasciatus from \n\nMogi-Gua\u00e7u River, with different chromosome configurations that suggest hybridization \n\nevents. The other two cases are related to piranhas Serrasalmus. Based on chromosome \n\nmorphology, Cestari and Galetti Jr. (1992) inferred the existence of hybridization between \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\n \n\ntwo different and isolated populations of S. spilopleura: from the Upper Paran\u00e1 and the \n\nParaguay River basins. Hubert et al. (2007; 2008) studied 3 closely related species from \n\nMadeira River (Serrasalmus compressus, Serrasalmus hollandi and Serrasalmus sp.) by \n\nmeans of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data. They indicated that recent isolation and \n\nancestral polymorphism alone are unlikely to produce the observed high levels of haplotype \n\nsharing and the authors propose mtDNA introgression through hybridization as the most \n\nlikely cause. Currently, genetic similarity of sympatric populations can be interpreted as \n\nevidence of a sympatric origin of species, evidence of introgressive hybridization or both \n\n(Grant et al. 2005). \n\nIntrogressive hybridization is a common natural phenomenon and many examples in \n\nanimals, and mainly in plants, have been reported (Anderson 1949). The remarkable \n\nimportance of hybridism zones as \u201cnatural laboratories for evolutionary process\u201d (Hewitt \n\n1988, 2011) must not mask its ecological impact. There has been considerable debate in the \n\necological and evolutionary literature over the relative importance and rate by which \n\nmicroevolutionary processes, operating at the population level, result in the separation and \n\ndifferentiation of lineages, populations and ultimately in speciation. As a microevolutionary \n\nprocess, hybridism influences the trajectory of around 10% of animal species, particularly in \n\nyoung, recently diverged species (Arnold 1997). Hybridization is usually infrequent in nature \n\nbetween sympatric species (Mallet 2008); when it occurs, however, it may have vast \n\nconsequences. Scribner et al. (2001) propose that over evolutionary time scales, hybridization \n\nprocesses can be an important source of diversification in fish species, as exemplified by the \n\nhybrid origin of the Poecilia complex. Horizontal gene flow among different groups of \n\nCharacidae may likewise result in deep alterations in morphological and molecular data at \n\nmany levels of the systematic hierarchy. Gene transfer may explain the paraphyletic \n\ncondition of the genus Astyanax as reported by Lucena (1993), Calcagnotto et al. (2005), and \n\nJavonillo et al. (2010). Although the Sossego?s Dam is a clear example of an anthropogenic \n\nhabitat, past geologic events may have mimic small environments that favoured gene transfer \n\namong different lineages; these scenarios are not strange to the Neotropical hydrographical \n\nhistory (Lundberg et al. 1998; Ribeiro 2003). The ancient role of natural hybridization \n\nprocess may bear consequences at high evolutionary levels because several populations in a \n\nparticular geographic context may be result of hybridization between two different taxa \n\n(Grant and Grant 1997). To better understand the relationship among the different Characidae \n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n\n \n\ntaxa, mainly those considered Incertae Sedis, it is essential to take into account the possibility \n\nof hybridization events, both anthropogenic and natural.  \n\nThe relevance of hybrids has been increasing in conservation biology. Hybridization \n\nmay lead to the formation of new species, to extinction of native species or both (Moyle and \n\nCech 2004) by swamping and replacing endemic genic pools with exotic genes from invasive \n\nspecies (Epifanio and Nielsen 2001; Tanaka 2007). Rates of hybridization and introgression \n\nhave increased dramatically worldwide because of widespread intentional and incidental \n\ntranspositions of organisms and habitat modifications by humans (Allendorf et al. 2010) and \n\nthe harmful effects of hybridization, with or without introgression, have led to the extinction \n\nof many populations and species in many plant and animal taxa (Allendorf et al. 2001; \n\nGurevitch and Padilla 2004; Rhymer and Simberloff 1996). Although there are no records of \n\nfish introductions for the Sossego?s Dam, A. giton is known only from this locality and \n\ntherefore, it is also the only known locale where this species is sympatric with O. argenteus.  \n\nTo determine whether toothed morphs are ecological dead-ends or are able to \n\nreproduce with each other or introgress to their parental lineages, analysis of many functional \n\naspects are still needed (e.g., gonadal and gametic development, and reproductive behavior). \n\nThere is a common belief that hybridization almost never results in gene flow and \n\nintrogression as a consequence of several post-zygotic natural barriers (Mayr 1966). \n\nHowever, Mallet (2005) suggested that the F1 hybrids should be the most difficult to achieve \n\nbecause they would be the result of special events. Barton (2001) also asserted that if fertile \n\nF1 hybrids are produced, they will almost certainly backcross to one or other parental \n\ngenotype. Although the toothed morphs seemed to be the F1 hybrids, they were represented \n\nby both sexes and their gonads were normally developed. \n\nMost hybrid zones reflect a balance between migration and selection against hybrids \n\n(Barton and Hewitt 1989). However, it must be stressed that at the Sossego dam the fish \n\npopulation is small and isolated so, there is no possible migration and genetic exchange. \n\nMoreover, the strong sexual disequilibrium may reduce the effective size of that population \n\nallowing it to the dispersive effect of the genetic drift. As pointed out by Payseur (2010) the \n\ninheritance process can contribute additional inter-locus heterogeneity to patterns of \n\nintrogression which are different between nuclear and mitochondrial DNA since variation in \n\neffective population size leads to disparate rates of genetic drift and also, genomic \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n\n \n\ncompartments are expected to show discordant levels of introgression in species with sex-\n\nbiased dispersal. Some studies on the radiation of several small fish species found that \n\nsympatric pair of species appeared monophyletic in their mitochondrial but poly- or \n\nparaphyletic in their nuclear genes, suggesting hybridization of colonizing species, followed \n\nby the fixation of one parental mtDNA (Seehausen 2004). These new recombinants might aid \n\nthe fixation of novel genotypes that are well suited to fill vacant niches in the novel \n\nenvironments in which adaptive radiations occur (Schilthuizen et al. 2004). These radiations \n\ngenerates a great amount of variation subject to strong selection purging incompatibility \n\nalleles and other alleles linked to them (Seehausen 2004). However, alleles there were rare in \n\neither parent population might them hitchhike to high frequencies in the hybrid population \n\n(Schilthuizen et al. 1999; 2001) (the \u201crare allele effect\u201d) influencing, therefore, several \n\nmorphological traits.  This kind of radiation influenced by hybridization events and also a \n\nbalance between drift and selection against hybrids may be a good model for understanding \n\nsome of the variation among the Neotropical Characidae fish. \n\nThe genetic barriers involving chromosomal rearrangements are much stronger than \n\nsingle-locus barriers and so, they are far more likely to trigger a snowball accumulation of \n\npost-zygotic incompatibilities that can lead to reproductive isolation of the species (Navarro \n\nand Barton 2003) or their eventual hybrids. Therefore, the relationship between the toothed \n\nmorphs and their parental species will be at least partially limited by their chromosomal \n\nincompatibilities. Overall karyotypic similarity between the parental species allowed the \n\nproduction of the toothed morphs. More critically, it is unknown whether other mechanisms \n\nacting on the reproductive tissues may counteract the unbalanced karyotypes seen in the renal \n\ntissue. Some species of the livebearer Poeciliopsis are known to have hybrid origin (Schultz \n\n1961) and developed different mechanisms to avoid chromosomal incompatibilities on \n\nheterozygotes. The \u201chybridogenesis\u201d allow this species to transmit only the maternal \n\nchromosomes of each generation to the eggs, with the consequent meiotic loss of the male \n\nchromosomes (Schultz 1969). \n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n\n \n\nConclusions \n\n \n\nThe toothed morph specimens were considered hybrids between Astyanax giton and \n\nOligosarcus argenteus. Hybridization bears potentially high impact on the phylogeny of \n\nCharacidae fish since the horizontal gene flow may character combinations that might \n\npreclude the establishment of monophyletic characters for involved taxa. Although the high \n\nlevels of chromosomal variation and instability found in the toothed morphs strongly suggest \n\ntheir hybrid nature, the absence of meiotic data did not allow determining the effects of the \n\nhybrid karyotype on fertility. Therefore, the introgression of Oligosarcus argenteus genes \n\ninside Astyanax giton specimens demands more information about the genetic structure on \n\nboth species. The existence of spontaneous intergeneric hybrids in an anthropogenic \n\nenvironment underlines still another threat to the Neotropical fish biodiversity. \n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n\n \n\nBibliography \n\n   \n\nAllendorf FW, Hohenlohe PA, Luikat G (2010) Genomics and the future of conservation \n\ngenetics.

More \n\nthan one single fragment can be seen for the toothed morph and A. \n\ngiton studied specimens. It may suggest strongest relationship between \n\nthe Toothed morph and A. giton in despite of O. argenteus.
