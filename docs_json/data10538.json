In most cases several fishing practices for one species exist, while in the \n\nexploitation of deepwater rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris) and other nektobenthic \n\ncrustacean, exploitation is exclusively reserved to the demersal trawling fleet. Because of the \n\nenvironmental impact of demersal trawling especially in deep waters and bycatch proportions \n\nexceeding ethical and ecological limits alternative fishing practices are needed urgently. In the \n\nAzores, Canary Islands and Cape Verde shrimp fisheries developed using semi-floating traps, \n\nthe present work provides information about the feasibility of using such traps in a commonly \n\ntrawling dominated fishery of the deepwater rose shrimp. However the low abundance of the \n\nspecie made experimental conditions unfavorable. More frequent the golden shrimp (Plesionika \n\nmartia), a scavenging specie was caught. A broad range of baits was tested, including \n\nfluorescent light and proceeded baits such as sardine paste (chum) with promising outcomes for \n\nfuture research in this field. \n\nKeywords: gear substitution; demersal trawling; light, semi-floating traps, crustacean fisheries \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\niii \n\nResumo \nNa Uni\u00e3o Europeia, 88% dos stocks s\u00e3o explorados acima do rendimento m\u00e1ximo sustent\u00e1vel \n\ne 30% est\u00e3o fora dos seus limites biol\u00f3gicos de seguran\u00e7a, com altera\u00e7\u00f5es que podem ser, em \n\nalguns casos, irrevers\u00edveis. O Comiss\u00e1rio Europeu dos Assuntos Mar\u00edtimos e das Pescas \n\nresumiu a presente situa\u00e7\u00e3o com as seguintes palavras: \u201c O neg\u00f3cio do costume deixou de ser \n\numa op\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d. \n\nA tentativa de reforma da Pol\u00edtica Comum das Pescas passa pela Diretiva Quadro Estrat\u00e9gia \n\nMarinha (DQEM). Esta Directiva tem o ambicioso objectivo de impedir a perda de servi\u00e7os dos \n\necossistemas e biodiversidade nas \u00e1guas da UE e alcan\u00e7ar o Bom Estado Ambiental em 2020. \n\nPara o sector das pescas, est\u00e1 definido que at\u00e9 2020, a captura de todos os stocks dever\u00e1 estar \n\ndentro ou abaixo dos n\u00edveis de explora\u00e7\u00e3o que correspondem ao rendimento m\u00e1ximo \n\nsustent\u00e1vel e todos os recursos devem ser geridos atrav\u00e9s de uma abordagem ecossist\u00e9mica.  \n\nO Bom Estado Ambiental \u00e9 definido por onze descritores, sendo que o sexto refere o seguinte: \n\n\u201ca integridade do fundo marinho assegura o funcionamento do ecossistema\u201d, dando uma \n\nespecial aten\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 protec\u00e7\u00e3o dos habitats bent\u00f3nicos e \u00eanfase \u00e0 sua import\u00e2ncia para o \n\necossistema. A pesca de arrasto envolve a tecnologia de pesca mais destrutiva, praticada \n\ngeralmente \u00e0 escala industrial, com elevados impactos na comunidade bent\u00f3nica e elevadas \n\npropor\u00e7\u00f5es de bycatch que excedem os limites ecol\u00f3gicos e \u00e9ticos. \n\nA pesca de arrasto demersal entra em conflito directo com as artes est\u00e1ticas como palangres, \n\narmadilhas ou redes, e ocupa maioria das zonas de pesca. Devido a limita\u00e7\u00e3o da pesca de arrasto \n\nnos A\u00e7ores, est\u00e1 a ser desenvolvida uma pesca com covos semi-flutuantes, com resultados \n\npromissores. As armadilhas n\u00e3o t\u00eam impacto na fauna e flora bent\u00f3nicas. Para al\u00e9m das raz\u00f5es \n\necol\u00f3gicas e legais, outro factor importante \u00e9 o benef\u00edcio s\u00f3cio-econ\u00f3mico para a frota \n\npolivalente, visto que a poucos postos de trabalho. No entanto, a pesca com armadilhas \u00e9 uma \n\natividade que pode ser desenvolvida em embarca\u00e7\u00f5es de menores dimens\u00f5es, envolvendo \n\ninvestimentos menores. A implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de uma pesca de gamba com armadilhas em Portugal, \n\niria proporcionar o aumento da rentabilidade de uma larga comunidade pesqueira que utiliza \n\nembarca\u00e7\u00f5es polivalentes. Assim, o presente trabalho tem como objectivo avaliar a viabilidade \n\necon\u00f3mica e t\u00e9cnica da pesca de gamba com covos semi-flutuantes.  \n\nO projecto foi desenvolvido em duas \u00e1reas a Sul e Sudoeste da costa de Portugal. No total, \n\nforam executados 35 ensaios, e colocados 3413 covos. A esp\u00e9cie alvo foi captura em quantidade \n\nreduzida, devido provavelmente \u00e0 utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de isco pouco adequado. Os resultados de estudos \n\nrealizados com a gamba indicam que esta esp\u00e9cie \u00e9 principalmente predadora, alimentando-se \n\n\n\n \n\niv \n\nde presas vivas, mais especificamente de um numero relativamente reduzido de poliquetas \n\nbent\u00f3nicas e endobent\u00f3nicos.  \n\nO camar\u00e3o mais capturado pelos covos foi o camar\u00e3o marreco (Plesionika martia). As pescarias \n\nde crust\u00e1ceos de profundidade nas Ilhas Can\u00e1rias, Cabo Verde e A\u00e7ores, est\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m \n\nconcentradas em esp\u00e9cies de Plesionika, mas contrariamente aos estas ilhas atl\u00e2nticas as \n\ndensidades estimadas s\u00e3o demasiado reduzidas para uma explora\u00e7\u00e3o econ\u00f3mica vi\u00e1vel. \n\nA enorme press\u00e3o sobre a gamba exercida pelo arrasto poder\u00e1 estar a afectar igualmente outras \n\nesp\u00e9cies de crust\u00e1ceos como o camar\u00e3o marreco, visto que ambos os stocks se sobrep\u00f5em na \n\nmesma extens\u00e3o batim\u00e9trica. Adicionalmente, o camar\u00e3o marreco \u00e9 uma esp\u00e9cie tropical que \n\nna costa portuguesa se encontra no limite Norte da sua distribui\u00e7\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica.  \n\nO trabalho realizado forneceu informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre os tipos de isco adequados. Para al\u00e9m do isco \n\ncomum (peixe gordo) foram testados peixe triturado, ra\u00e7\u00e3o de aquacultura e atratores luminosos \n\nfluorescentes. O peixe triturado acabou por ser mais eficaz do que o isco comum. A luz tamb\u00e9m \n\nproduziu capturas significativamente mais elevadas que o isco comum. Este \u00faltimo resultado \u00e9 \n\nmuito importante e requerer\u00e1 mais investiga\u00e7\u00e3o no futuro, visto que a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de peixe como \n\nisco permanece um tema cr\u00edtico e a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de luz poder\u00e1 ser uma das poss\u00edveis solu\u00e7\u00f5es, \n\ncomo substituto do isco tradicional, numa pesca mais sustent\u00e1vel e para esp\u00e9cies com \n\nestrat\u00e9gias alimentares muito espec\u00edficas, como a gamba. \n\nOs crust\u00e1ceos s\u00e3o o grupo de esp\u00e9cies capturadas mais rent\u00e1vel, tanto de captura selvagem \n\ncomo de produ\u00e7\u00e3o em aquacultura. Infelizmente, s\u00e3o obtidos utilizando pr\u00e1ticas de pesca e de \n\ncultivo que s\u00e3o destrutivas para com o meio ambiente. Os sistemas de aquacultura intensiva, na \n\nsua maioria instalados em antigas zonas de mangal, resultaram em grandes faixas de terra \u00e1ridas \n\ne inf\u00e9rteis. Os impactos da pesca de arrasto demersal n\u00e3o t\u00eam o mesmo alcance visual, mas s\u00e3o \n\ncompar\u00e1veis a actos de desfloresta\u00e7\u00e3o. Neste contexto, o desenvolvimento de uma pescaria \n\ndirigida a camar\u00f5es de profundidade utilizando artes de pesca de menores impactos, como as \n\narmadilhas, traria um enorme benef\u00edcio dos pontos de vista ecol\u00f3gico e s\u00f3cio-econ\u00f3mico. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nv \n\nList of Figures \n \n\nFig. 1 Landings of Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) and deepwater rose shrimp \n\n(Parapenaeus longirostris) between 1980 and 2014 in Portugal (DGRM, Recuros da Pesca), \n\nincluding 2015 (until September) ............................................................................................... 3 \n\n \n\nFig. 2 Differences in Euro per kilogram for norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) caught in \n\ntraps and demersal towed gears (demersal trawl and beam trawl) from five European \n\nCountries (Sweden, France, Portugal, Ireland and United Kongdom).

Introduction  \n \n\nIn the European Union 88 % percent of stocks are fished beyond Maximum Sustainable Yield \n\n(MSY) and 30% are outside their biological limits facing irreversible population changes \n\n(Greenpaper 2009). The commissioner of the EU for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs Maria \n\nDamanaki summed up the situation with the words: \u201cBusiness as usual is not an option \n\nanymore\u201d. A derivative of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the Marine Strategy \n\nFramework Directive (MSFD, 2008/56/EC). The directive was released with the ambitious aim \n\nto stop the loss of ecosystem services and biodiversity in the EU waters and to establish good \n\nenvironmental status (GES) by 2020. For the fisheries sector it is defined that all stocks should \n\nbe harvested at MSY or lower under the ecosystem approach to fisheries. GES is defined by \n\neleven descriptors, and descriptor number six reads as follows: \u201cseafloor integrity ensures the \n\nfunctioning of the ecosystem\u201d giving a special attention to the protection of benthic habitats \n\nand emphasizing their importance for the ecosystem. Trawling is the most destructive fisheries \n\ntechnology practiced on industrial scale, with high impacts on the benthic community (Hall\u2013\n\nSpencer et al. 2002; Jones 1992) and bycatch proportions exceeding ethical and ecological \n\nlimits (Borges 2001; Kennelly 1995). Traps in contrary have very little direct impact on the \n\nbenthic environment and are highly selective (species and size) towards the species targeted. \n\nNevertheless are traps in deepwater shrimp fisheries the exception rather than the rule and \n\nreceive only in recent years more attention due to the motivations of the named directives and \n\nreformations to substitute damaging fishing gears.   \n\nCrustaceans are the supreme group of marine capture and aquaculture production with over-\n\naverage market values and high demand. Unfortunately they are mostly obtained by \n\nenvironmental destructive cultivation or fishing practices. The intensive aquaculture systems in \n\nformer mangrove forests in the tropical regions resulted in large dry and unfertile land stripes. \n\nThe impacts of demersal trawl fisheries are more withdrawn from our perception but they are \n\nvery similar and often compared to deforestation (Kaiser 2000; Roberts 2002).  \n\nThe deepwater rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris) (DWS) is a short lived nektobenthic \n\ndecapod living in depth between 20 - 750 m (Tom et al. 1988) with different bathymetric depth \n\nranges in the Atlantic and Mediterranean populations. A comprehensive review about the \n\nbiology and ecology of the DWS stocks in the Atlantic is available from Sobrino et al. (2005). \n\nAccording to this study in the Algarve, the highest abundance can be found between 100 \u2013 300 \n\nm with a positive gradient towards larger carapace length (CL) with greater depth. Lifespan is \n\nhttp://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0163:FIN:EN:PDF\nhttp://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:164:0019:0040:EN:PDF\n\n\n \n\n2 \n\nexpected to be shorter than three years and maturity is reached at 24 mm CL (females) and 20 \n\nmm CL (males). Females carry ovaries throughout the year except between February and April. \n\nTwo spawning seasons are identified, the more important summer peak is followed by a second \n\nautumn spawning peak involving only younger individuals. Depending on size DWS feeds on \n\na large variety of prey ranging from planktonic crustaceans to small cephalopods and fish. \n\nSobrino et al. (2005) identified two feeding behaviors, one during the digging phase associated \n\nwith preys living in the benthos (polychaeta, foraminifera, echinoderms) and the hunting phase, \n\nconcentrating on demersal and pelagic animals such as small fish and cephalopods as well as \n\nother crustaceans. The different feeding behavior support the evidence that the specie is \n\nperforming vertical migrations in 24 h cycles resulting in different catchabilities (by the \n\ntrawlers) at night and day (Sonderblohm 2011). \n\nThe DWS is a specie economically exploited mainly in the Mediterranean and in a small extend \n\nin the North-East Atlantic along the coast of Portugal to the Gulf of Cadiz. In the Atlantic only \n\nSpain and Portugal conduct fishing on this specie. Sobrino et al. (2005) proposed on stock for \n\nthe Atlantic population but detailed genetic information is missing. Portugal\u2019s demersal \n\ntrawling fleet is targeting largely the named specie and Norway lobster. In recent years the \n\nshrimp fishery became more important due to cut offs in the quota of Norway lobster (Nephrops \n\nnorvegicus). In contrary to DWS these stocks are managed at the European level under the \n\nInternational Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES). Because the stock was showing signs \n\nof overfishing, in 2005, a recovery plan for norway lobster (and European hake) was \n\nimplemented (Council Regulation No 2166/2005). During a period of ten years, an annual \n\nreduction of fishing effort of 10 % is aiming at restoring the stocks in West Galicia and South \n\nPortugal. Concomitantly the advised TAC is steadily decreasing.  \n\nNevertheless is the fishing effort of the crustacean trawling fleet alternating between DWS and \n\nNorway lobster depending on the Norway lobster TAC and abundance of DWS. Because of the \n\nabsence of a TAC for DWS and a series of years with great abundance, the fishery focuses more \n\non DWS and became more important in recent years (Fig 1, Table 1).  \n\nhttp://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:345:0005:0010:EN:PDF\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nFig 1 Landings of Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) and deepwater rose shrimp (Parapenaeus \n\nlongirostris) between 1980 and 2014 in Portugal (DGRM, Recuros da Pesca), including 2015 (until \n\nSeptember) \n\nTable 1 Revenues (Mio. Euros) for Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) and deepwater rose shrimp \n\n(Parapenaeus longirostris) and the generated market share by deepwater rose shrimp in Portugal \n\n(DGRM, Recuros da Pesca) \n\n \n\n \n\nWhile the Norway lobster stocks are assessed by the ICES, the DWS assessment is carried out \n\nat the national level by the Instituto Portugu\u00eas do Mar e da Atmosfera (IPMA). Data comes \n\nfrom the official landings and research surveys carried out once a year. According to a virtual \n\npopulation analyzes, over a time period of five years (1984 \u2013 1989) the DWS stock of the \n\nAtlantic was overexploited (Pestana, 1991). Nevertheless this is a resource with short life and \n\nlarge fluctuations, dependent on good recruitment and therefore is strongly related to \n\nenvironmental conditions. This is supported by a study carried out by Ana Moreira and Borges \n\nYear\nNorway\n\nLobster\n(Mio. EURO)\n\nDeepwa-\n\nter Rose-\n\nShrimp\n(Mio.

Even though the results are \n\nambiguous a general trend shows that weak upwelling and warmer waters enhance recruitment \n\nof DWS. On the contrary, Norway lobster abundance is positively correlated with the same \n\nNOA patterns but with a preference for lower SST and stronger upwelling.  \n\nIn conclusion, Sobrino et al. (2005) recommend an effort reduction of 10 \u2013 15% to decrease the \n\nfishing pressure and gear modifications to respect the Minimum Landing Size (MLS) of 24 mm \n\nCL in DWS (e.g. square mesh panels with 60 mm mesh width) (Campos et al. 2002). \n\nThe high environmental impacts of deepwater trawling, the indiscriminate catch pattern and the \n\nhigh bycatch mortality are putting it under pressure of conservationists, scientist and the public \n\nmedia. Because trawling was strongly subsidized during the 1990\u2019s its capacity grew and \n\nbecame the mode of production for demersal fisheries (Sumaila 2013). This is shown by the \n\nvalue of the landings of different gears. Demersal trawling accounts for 38 % of total value of \n\nlandings in the EU member states (STECF Report 2014). Trawling vessels are catching large \n\nquantities, relatively to the employment provided (FAO 2005). This makes the activity very \n\nquestionable from a socio-economic point of view, in face of the high value of the demersal \n\nfish and crustacean stocks, but also due to the policy from the new CFP, that incentives the \n\nallocation of resources towards fisheries with less impacts on the environment and providing \n\nmore livelihoods to the fishing community: \n\n\u201cWhen allocating the fishing opportunities available to them, as referred to in Article 16, \n\nmember states shall use transparent and objective criteria including those of an environmental, \n\nsocial and economic nature. The criteria to be used may include, inter alia, the impact of fishing \n\non the environment, the history of compliance, the contribution to the local economy and \n\nhistoric catch levels. Within the fishing opportunities allocated to them, member states shall \n\nendeavour to provide incentives to fishing vessels deploying selective fishing gear or using \n\nfishing techniques with reduced environmental impact, such as reduced energy consumption or \n\nhabitat damage.\u201d - Article 17, Reformed Common Fisheries Policy \n \n\nThe use of gears with fewer environmental impacts, such as traps, would also add value to the \n\ncatch, because fish or crustacean caught with a trawling net are in general poorer state due to \n\nthe heavy physical impacts during the hauls and on deck processing (Leoc\u00e1dio et al. 2012). In \n\nterms of ecological impacts, fuel consumption and habitat destruction bottom trawling stands \n\nout (Table 2). \n\nhttps://stecf.jrc.ec.europa.eu/data-reports\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nTable 2 Summary of the comparison between demersal trawling (DTS) and Traps, by type of impact, \n\nwith list of criteria and related references \n\n \n\nThe impacts of trawling are mainly studied on shallow water habitats and hard bottoms because \n\nof the drastic consequences for calcified structures. Deep waters and soft bottoms are a difficult \n\nstudy environment with ecosystem characteristics that make them more vulnerable to any kind \n\nof disturbance (Kaiser 2000). In nature the strongest physical forces are induced by weather \n\n(e.g. wind) and the turbulence it generates is vertically transported into deeper water layers by \n\norbital waves, but with depth the power of the waves gradually disappears. The evolutionary \n\nhistory of the organisms in such an environment took place without or with very infrequent \n\nimpacts such as falling material from upper water layers. Besides this, other forms of energy \n\nare also scarce because of the absence of light. Low metabolic rates, late maturity and slow \n\ngrowth rates, make deep sea species more vulnerable to changes in the environment, reducing \n\ntheir ability to recover from disturbances (Collie 2000; Johnson 2002; Kaiser 2000). \n\nTrawling is producing a climate of steady disturbance in this commonly \u201csilent\u201d environment \n\nwith consequences for the abundance, composition and distribution of epi- and endofauna, \n\nmaking it less diverse and abundant (Schratzberger 2002). Macroscopic changes also take place \n\nsuch as the general trend towards smaller sizes of endofaunal species due to the size-selective \n\ncharacter of the gear (Queir\u00f3s 2006). Overall the ecosystem dynamic is dominated and \n\ncontrolled by the fishing activity itself. This includes indirect impacts such as food subsidies to \n\nthe scavenging species in form of offshore discarded bycatch, resulting in greater diversity and \n\nabundance of this community (Kaiser 2000). Another reason for the increased abundance of \n\nlow trophic species is the predator release due to the size selectivity towards maximum sizes. \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nBesides the physical impact of the otter doors and tickler chains, trawling originates the \n\nresuspension of benthic sediments in clouds of 3 \u2013 4 m in height and 70 \u2013 200 m wide, \n\ntransporting organic and inorganic matter up to 800 g m-2s-1 in the surrounding areas (Durrieu \n\nde Madron 2011). The siphons of burrowing species are covered and the oxygenation of the \n\nsediments is reduced. Deepwater currents are able to transport these clouds and alter the \n\nsedimentation rates even in bathyal depths (Mart\u00edn 2008) which makes it difficult to assess the \n\ntotal area impacted by a trawl besides the towed area.  \n\nThe Portuguese trawl fishery for deep water crustaceans has initiated its activity in 1940\u2019s \n\ntargeting exclusively Norway lobster. In the second half of that century a Portuguese-Spanish \n\njoint venture initiated the industrial exploration of DWS. At present the Portuguese trawling \n\nfleet holds licenses for fish and crustacean and comprises 186 vessels, with 26 vessels licensed \n\nfor the capture of Crustacea (Wise et al. 2015). At present this crustacean fleet mainly targets \n\nnorway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) and DWS. Other deepwater crustacean species, such as \n\nred shrimp (Aristeus antennatus), giant red shrimp (Aristaeomorpha foliacea) and the scarlet \n\nshrimp (Aristaeopsis edwardsiana) are also targeted but in relatively small quantities.  \n\nThe Portuguese trawling fleet is not allowed to operate inside 6 nautical miles from the baseline. \n\nThe enforcement of this legislation was helped by the introduction of a vessel monitoring \n\nsystem (VMS) in 2002 for all Vessels above 15 m. Information from the system concerning the \n\nposition and speed of the vessel is transmitted to shore-based facility every two hours. Using \n\nthe vessel speed as a proxy, it is possible to identify individual trawl hauls. Then, this \n\ninformation can be matched with landings and logbook entries. The overall result is a detailed \n\nmapping of fishing effort allocation (Afonso-Dias 2008).  \n\nThe Fishing trips never exceed three days (Afonso-Dias 2008) with average trawling speed of \n\n3.0 nm/h (Sobrino 1998; Sobrino et al. 2005; Viriato and de Figueiredo 1991). The fishery for \n\nnektobenthic shrimp and Norway lobster takes place on soft and muddy bottoms between 200 \n\n- 600 m along the South and South-Western Coast of Portugal. Norway lobster, red shrimp, \n\nscarlet shrimp and giant red shrimp are in the deeper waters (400 \u2013 1000 m), while the DWS is \n\nbetween 200 - 400 m (Campos et al. 2002; Sobrino et al. 2005). This depth spectrum is covering \n\nparts of the outer shelf but mostly the continental slope. Because each fishery is taking place \n\npredominantly in a certain depth spectrum and during day or night the bycatch composition is \n\ndiffering with target specie. The tows targeting Norway lobster are bringing up more deepwater \n\nspecies such as silvery pout (Gadiculus argenteus), roughtip grenadier (Nezumia \n\nsclerorhynchus), and mediterranean slimehead (Hoplostetus mediterraneus) (Monteiro 2001). \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nWhile the bycatch from shallower waters during tows for DWS are mainly consist of deep sea \n\nshark species (Galeus melastomus, Etmopterus pusillus, Etmopterus spinax) conger (Conger \n\nconger), European hake (Merluccius merluccius), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus and \n\nTrachuros picturatus) monkfish (Lophius piscatorius) and a variety of cephalopods (Fig. 7) \n\n(Borges 2001). Only blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) is present along the whole depth \n\nspectrum and consequently is found in both fisheries in enormous quantities (Fig. 7).  \n\nThe demersal trawling vessels are obliged by law to land at least 70% of target specie. For the \n\ncrustacean fleet this means only up to 30 % of the quantity caught can be fish. This also \n\nincreases the bycatch problem because the captain would violate the law when retaining fish \n\nexceeding the 30 % limit. On the other side, trawlers targeting fish can land up to 30 % of \n\ncrustacean species including the closed month of January. Because of the high value of \n\ncrustacean species and the low value of fish in recent years these vessels make full use of the \n\nregulation. \n\nBoth fisheries use a diamond mesh codend with a mesh width of 55mm for DWS and 70 mm \n\nfor Norway lobster (stretched, diagonal). MLS of 24 mm CL for DWS and 21 mm CL for \n\nnorway lobster are in place, to avoid recruitment overfishing. As said above  gear modifications \n\nare necessary to respect the of DWS and Norway lobster (e.g. square mesh panels with 60 mm \n\nmesh width) (Campos et al. 2002).  \n\nWhile for fish and lobsters there is the possibility to use trammel nets, gillnets, longlines or \n\ntraps, in fisheries for nektobenthic decapods such as DWS and the golden shrimp the option of \n\nusing gears alternative to trawling, is yet very little investigated. Traps are one of the oldest \n\nhunting gathering techniques, with long traditions in fisheries, available in a huge variety of \n\nshapes and sizes. But for demersal fisSh and crustacean stocks the common mode of production \n\nbecame demersal trawling due to high catch rates (low selectivity) and relatively easy \n\napplication. The expansion of trawling in demersal fisheries pushed traps back, and introduced \n\na new level of fishing effort. Consequently nowadays most stocks are either fully or \n\noverexploited, making viable fisheries with less efficient gears more difficult due to the low \n\ndensities encountered (Chuenpagdee et al. 2003; Myers and Worm 2003).  \n\nThe largest crustacean fishery in European waters by value and quantity is for Norway lobster, \n\na specie widely distributed over the North East Atlantic from Norway to Morocco as well as in \n\nthe Mediterranean (FAO, Species Fact Sheet).  \n\nhttp://www.fao.org/fishery/species/2647/en\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nIn terms of landed values it is as important as the traditional demersal finfish species such as \n\ncod, haddock or pollock. Interestingly a major trapping fleet developed in coexistence with \n\ntrawling due to some specialties of the specie. Because of behavioral reasons large males are \n\nmore vulnerable to traps, this results in a catch with mainly large individuals and in prime \n\ncondition (alive) with a significant higher market value (Fig. 2) (Leoc\u00e1dio et al. 2012). In the \n\ncertification process for Loch Torridon Norway lobster by the Marine Stewardship Council a \n\nfisherman stated (David 2003):  \n\n\u201cOn the economic side, Loch Torridon live Nephrops fetch three and four times the price of \n\nthe same creature netted by a trawler\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 2 Differences in Euro per kilogram for norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) caught in traps and \n\ndemersal towed gears (demersal trawl and beam trawl) from five European Countries (Sweden, France, \n\nPortugal, Ireland and United Kongdom). The difference in price for demersal trawling (pink) and traps \n\n(green) is highly significant (paired t-test, p=3x10-4). (STECF 2013) \n\n \n\nCreels and traps are common in Lobster fisheries around the world, but the catch of deepwater \n\nnektobenthic shrimp with pots or creels is less known. During the 1980\u2019s experimental trapping \n\nwas conducted by NOAA to explore deep-water crustaceans (King 1981; Struhsaker 1974). In \n\nthe Atlantic oceanic islands (Azores, Canary Islands and Cape Verde), where trawling is not \n\nallowed due to inadequate bottoms (steep and rocky), the local fisherman were forced to use \n\nalternative fishing methods. Arrasate-L\u00f3pez and Gonz\u00e1lez (2012) conducted experiments with \n\nsemi-floating traps around the Canary Islands. Between 100 \u2013 1300 m it was possible to catch \n\na variety of different species according to their bathymetric extend, with prospecting results for \n\nan economic exploration of golden shrimp (Plesionika edwardsii). Following the same concept, \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nCabo Verde carried out trials with the same outcomes and plans to open a commercial fishery \n\ntargeting golden shrimp with traps (Gonz\u00e1les 2012). \n\nSemi-floating traps have some advantages in comparison to common creels deployed on the \n\nbottom. The bait stays viable for a longer period because benthic scavengers (i.e. amphipods, \n\nisopods and equinoderms) are hindered to access the trap. Semi-floating traps are expected to \n\nlower the catch of other bottom crustacean species with no ability to swim (Norway lobster, \n\nspider crabs and hermit crabs) and increase the catches of nektobenthic species. A lifted trap \n\nwill be better to capture DWS.  \n\nCritical issues are the use of bait and ghost fishing but in face of the enormous impacts of \n\ntrawling, the damages can be considered minor. More difficult is the substitution of bait. \n\nArrasate-L\u00f3pez and Gonz\u00e1lez (2012) used chub mackerel and other species with high fat \n\ncontents. These are mainly small pelagic fish species due to their availability and low value. \n\nHowever, these species also represent prime nourishment for human consumption due to the \n\nhigh content of polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids. Existing literature about artificial baits is \n\nvery scarce and its efficacy is not yet established, therefore substitution of traditional baits is \n\nyet not in sight (Archdale 2011).  \n\n1.1 Objective  \nOverfishing and damaging fishing gear are responsible for the devastating state of fisheries \n\nresources in Europe and the world (Pauly et al. 2002). The following work aims to draw out the \n\npossibilities to use semi-floating traps in a trawling dominated fishery for the DWS in South \n\nPortugal including a preliminary evaluation of the economic viability of such a fishery.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n2. Material and Methods \n \n\nThe absence of information on trap fishing targeting DWS required the investigation of several \n\naspects such as, trap design, bait type, soaking time and distance of the traps from the bottom.  \n\nThe project was planned in two phases, one developed on the West coast, known to have \n\nmoderate conditions for DWS and the common fishing ground for the specie along the Algarve \n\ncoast. The were divided into two subareas, identified in South Sines (SS) and Sines North (SN) \n\nand Portimao (PRT) and Faro (FAR) (Fig. 3) \n\n \n\nFig. 3 The sample sites for the trapping experiments (SW &amp;S) with the related areas: Sines North (SN), \n\nSines South (SS), Portim\u00e3o (PRT) and Faro (FAR) \n\n \n\nIn both cases trawling was undertaken in the vicinity of the trap lines, to estimate DWS \n\nabundance in the area. The comparison of DWS length distributions between trawl and trap \n\ncatches would also allow the evaluation of the impact of the two gears on the population \n\nstructure. \n\nIt was expected that an improvement in the trap line design could be achieved during phase one \n\nand that such information could be used in phase two to maximize the catch and obtain \n\npreliminary information on the economic viability of trap fishing for DWS. \n\nThe experiments were conducted on two commercial fishing vessels. A trawler with 24.9 m \n\nusing a standard codend with 55 mm diagonal mesh with a crew of seven people and a \n\npolyvalent vessel with 17. 08 m operating the traps, with a crew of six. Both vessels can be \n\n NS\n\n SS\n\nPRT FAR\n\nS\nW\n\nS\n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nconsidered as representatives of their class. In the South coast, trawls were also undertaken with \n\na fine mesh codend (28 mm), in order to obtain DWS samples not affected by the codend \n\nselectivity of the commercial net. \n\n2.1 Trap design  \n \n\nThree different trap types were tested during the experimental part of the project.  \n\n? Type A \u2013 A modification of traps used for Norway lobster, but made of lighter material, \n\na model designed in cooperation with fisherman experienced in trap fishing of Norway \n\nlobster; (Fig. 4, a); \n\n? Type B \u2013 Light collapsible traps, originally used in nearshore fisheries of crabs in \n\nseagrass meadows, hence the structure is very fragile but the ability to fold the traps \n\nwould make it also for smaller vessels to deploy larger numbers of traps (Fig. 4, b); \n\n? Type C - conic trap type used in the shrimp fisheries in the Canary Islands and the \n\nAzores (Fig. 4, c). \n\n \n\na) b) \n\n  \n\nc)  \n\n \n\nFig. 4 a) Modified Norway lobster creel, b) collapsible trap type and c) conic shaped shrimp trap \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n2.2 Trap line setup \n \n\nPeak density of DWS is expected between 100 and 300 m, with average size of the individuals \n\nincreasing with depth. To target larger sizes, the trap lines were deployed bellow 200 meters \n\n(200 \u2013 400 m).  \n\nBecause the target species is nektobenthic, the basic design followed the description of a trap \n\nline to fish for other nektobenhtic shrimp (Arrasate-L\u00f3pes et al., 2012), described in (Fig. 5, a). \n\nTo give the traps buoyancy, floaters were installed on the top of the traps (Fig. 5, b). The buoys \n\nchosen are used on the head rope of trawling nets operating at the same depth and are, therefore, \n\nresistant to high pressures. At the bottom the traps were attached to the mainline with a piece \n\nof rope of varying lengths (1, 2, 3 or 4 m). The mainline had built-in lead and concrete blocks \n\nwere tied at regular spaces to guarantee it stayed in contact with the bottom.  \n\n \n\na) b) \n\n \n\nf\n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5 Left: Scheme of a randomized trapping line with the three trap types in different distances from \n\nthe seafloor. Right: Semi-floating traps used in the fishery for different nektobenthic crustaceans \n\nthroughout the Atlantic Islands \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n2.3 Bait \n \n\nTo identify the optimum of bait or attractant different natural and artificial baits were tested. \n\nFatty fish species such as sardine or mackerel were salted. Three new bait types were also tested \n\non the South coast, chum (paste of minced sardine) used by recreational fisherman, aquaculture \n\nfish pellets and fluorescent light sticks.  \n\nLight regulates migratory movements on daily or life cycle basis in deepwater crustaceans \n\n(Aguzzi 2009). It dictates the daily vertical migrations and consequently also significantly the \n\nfeeding behavior.  \n\nThe condition of the bait (signs of consumption=1, no consumption=0) was registered for each \n\ntrap  \n\n2.4 Soaking time \n \n\nDWS concentrates on the bottom during the day to forage, mainly preying on endobenthic and \n\nbenthic animals. Because of this, the trawl catches are at a peak around noon (Sonderblohm \n\n2011). It is therefore expected that the feeding activity is highest immediately after returning \n\nfrom the pelagic phase, at around sunrise. To test the variation in catchability throughout the \n\nday, four time frames were tested: \n\nI. Sunrise \n\nII. Daytime \n\nIII. Sunset  \n\nIV. Day + Night  \n\nThe soaking time varied from 2 to 48 hours. Occasionally longer times happened due to \n\ndifficulties in retrieving the tarps during bad weather. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n2.5 Density of DWS \n \n\nThe density of the DWS was evaluated using swept method approach, based on the trawl \n\ncatches, in accordance to the FAO guidelines for trawl surveys (Sparre and Venema 1998). The \n\nestimations were done for each tow and the average for S and SE calculated. The trawled \n\ndistance was calculated based on the registered vessel speed and the trawl duration. The wing \n\nspread is considered to be the best estimate of the width of the area swept by a trawl because \n\nthe otter boards and bridles are much wider than the net itself and pass on the swirled-up \n\norganisms into the codend, consequently is the are-swept a function of headrope, length (hr) \n\nand a conversion factor (X2) correcting for the real net opening multiplied with the towed \n\ndistance (D).  \n\n? = ? ? ?? ? ?2 \n\nThe caught biomass of DWS of each tow was simply divided by the area swept to obtain a \n\nrelative abundance index of the specie.  \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n2.6 Statistical analysis \n \n\nThe total number of traps in a particular line were defined by the bottom characteristics, to \n\navoid setting the line on rocky sites. The factors being tested (trap type, distance to the bottom \n\nand bait time) were completely randomized. Fifty randomization schemes were prepared and \n\nused during the traps deployment, in order to quickly construct the line. For the identification, \n\neach trap was tagged with a individual number.  \n\nA logistic linear model (response variable presence or absence of the species) was used. The \n\ncontinuous variable soaking time was transformed into a two level factor DURATION: short, \n\nsoaking time &lt;12hours, and long, soaking time ? than 12 hours. Other factors considered were \n\nBAIT TYPE, TRAP TYPE, TIME OF DAY (1=sunrise, 2= sunset, 3=all day and 4= night), REGION \n\n(SW=Southwest and S=South), AREA (SN, SS, PRT and FAR) and DISTANCE FROM THE \n\nSEAFLOOR (0, 1 2 and 3 meters). In the case of significant variables, contrast were used to \n\ncompare the levels. \n\nThe consumption of the bait was also classified into one of two categories, consumed (1) and \n\nnot consumed (0). The category consumed includes the fully consumed and half consumed bait. \n\nA logistic model was applied to compare regions and areas. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n3. Results \nThe location of the trials are presented in Fig. 6, while the characteristics of the trap and trawl \n\nessays are presented in Table 3 and Table 4. Given the lack of success in catching DWS during \n\nthe first phase of the experiments on the SW coast, and the impossibility of identifying the best \n\nchoice of factors to maximize DWS catches, the completely randomized set up was maintained \n\nduring the trials in the South coast.  \n\n \n\nFig. 6 Conducted field work during the experimental phase indicated by blue lines (trawls) and red lines \n\n(traps) along the South and South-West Coast of Portugal.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nTable 3 Number of trials with according coordinates, duration time of day, depth and bait in the South-\n\nWest coast (15) and Algarve (20).

Each \n\nline consisted of 80 \u2013 150 traps, of which 15 lines were placed in Sines (SN, SS) and 20 in the \n\nAlgarve (FAR, PRT) (Fig. 6). In total, 16 different species were caught consisting of eight \n\ndecapods species, four Osteichthyes, one Chondrithye, one gastropod and two equinoderms \n\n(Table 6).  \n\nSimultaneously, 45 trawls were conducted during this period, 19 in the Southwest Coast, and \n\n26 in the Algarve (Table 4).  \n\nIn both vessels the species caught were identified, counted and weighted. In the case of the \n\ntrawler this was done on a subsample of the catch, and the numbers and weight of the subsample \n\nwere extrapolated to the total catch. Samples of DWS were taken for each tow to obtain size \n\nfrequencies and weight-length relationship of the population.  \n\nDensities between 0.10 and 0.12 g/m\u00b2 were observed (Table 5).The densities estimated were \n\ngenerally higher in the South and South-West.  \n\nThe target specie DWS was caught rarely with the traps. Instead of DWS, the only decapod \n\nentering the traps in amounts allowing statistical analysis was the golden shrimp, Plesionika \n\nmartia. In particular the PRT area was showing highest catches followed by Faro and \n\nexceptional catches as well in the South-West.  \n\nTo estimate the area affected by traps, sophisticated oceanographic data is necessary, such as \n\nthe intensity and direction of benthic currents in the area (Miller 1990). Moreover, the area of \n\nattraction is heavily dependent on the ability of the target specie to detect the bait. Neither one \n\nof these aspects, current information nor olfactory capacity, were available. \n\nThe statistical analysis was only applied to the golden shrimp, and only for the South coast data. \n\nA total of 1965 traps were included in the analysis, 42 of them with presence of the gold shrimp.  \n\nFrom the factors considered in the logistic model, only bait type was significant (p.value &lt;\n\n0.001). Bait categories considered were: oily fish (S+C+SC), chum (CH), pellets (AF) and the \n\nfluorescent light (L) as indicated in (Fig. 7). The four bait levels were compared using contrasts \n\n(Table 7). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nTable 7 Contrasts for different baits used during the experimental phase. Cavala and Sardine are \n\nsummarized in the group \u201coily fish\u201d \n\n \n\nThe results show that the differences are highest between chum and oily fish. The efficiency of \n\nthe bait, from the most efficient to the least efficient are: \n\n1. Chum \n\n2. Fluorescent Light \n\n3. Pellets \n\n4. Oily fish \n\nThe scavenger activity was described as well by the condition of the bait after hauling. A total \n\nof 3321 traps were observed (1112 with sight of bait consumption). The study sites of the SW \n\nshow a higher bait consumption than the South (p-value 0.0216) and Faro less scavenger \n\nactivity than Portim\u00e3o (p-value-0.0006). The proportion of bait consumption categories in each \n\narea are presented in Fig.7. \n\n  \n\n \n\nFig. 8 Scavenger activity in the four sampling areas (SN, SS, PRT, FAR). The bait conditions was \n\nmacroscopic evaluated and grouped into intact, half consumed and consumed. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\nHigher rates of bait consumption in the SW coast reflect the capture of more benthic species \n\nincluding high numbers of the henslow swimming crab, seastars and seacucumbers.  \n\nThe problems encountered regarding the bait and the general low abundance resulted in catches \n\nbelow consideration for a viable fishing operation. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n4. Discussion \n \n\nThe catch of DWS was more difficult than previously assumed. One reason could be the low \n\nabundance in the present year, given the fluctuating nature of this resource. This is in agreement \n\nwith the decreasing tendency in the landing since 2011 (Fig 1). From 2011 to 2014, the \n\nestimated landings were, 1057, 672, 641 and 418 tones, respectively (DGRM, Estat\u00edsticas da \n\nPesca). During the first 6 months of 2015 the DWS landings were 146 tones, compared with \n\n158 for the first 6 months of 2014 (DGRM, Data Pescas Difus\u00e3o). These values suggest that \n\n2015 will be a year of low DWS catches, assumed to be related with low abundances of the \n\nresource.  \n\nSome simple calculations of the expected number caught in the traps, based on the DWS \n\ndensities estimated with the trawling and probable trap attraction areas were performed. The \n\nattraction area was assumed to have a circular shape, in the absence of better information for a \n\nmore sophisticated approach to estimate attraction area, such as current speeds, behavior of \n\nodor plumes and sensitivity of the DWS to the different baits presented (Aedo and Arancibia \n\n2003). Assuming the area towed and the corresponding DWS catch, the estimated average \n\ndensity of this species was 0.10 and 0.12 g/m2 for the SW and S coast respectively. Considering \n\nthe estimated average individual weight was 11.8 g, the expected numbers caught in the traps, \n\nbased on an attraction area with one meter radius, were between zero to one. The extremely low \n\ncatches obtained with the raps, could therefore be the result of very low densities of the DWS. \n\nThe lifecycle of the species also impacts on trap catchability. DWS is a nectobenthic penaidae \n\nspecies, spending part of the day close to the bottom (day time) and scattering to layers above \n\nthe bottom the rest of the day (night time) (Sobrino et al. 2005). DWS is feeding on a variety \n\nof organism depending on the stage of the daily cycle, but the diet is dominated by a variety of \n\nsmall endobenthic organisms (Bergstr\u00f6m 2000; Sobrino et al. 2005).  \n\nOther deep water shrimp of the family Pandalidae, that follow the daily migration pattern of \n\nmesopelagic species, feed on a wider variety of organisms (Fanelli and Cartes 2004). Cartes \n\n(1993) pointed out that the variation in prey is much smaller in species foraging on benthic \n\nprey, such as the DWS, than pelagic hunting crustacean species (golden shrimp).  \n\nFanelli and Cartes (2004) estimated a trophic diversity index for golden shrimp of 3.3 while in \n\nDWS it varied between 1.04 and 1.5 depending on sex and region (Kapiris 2004). The \n\ndeepwater rose shrimp is focused on Lophogaster typicus, mysids and other amphipods but in \n\na much smaller extent, on discarded osteichtthyes and cephalopods. In conclusion, DWS is \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\nmostly preying on a narrow range of benthic invertebrates, rather than scavenging. This may be \n\nthe reason why the golden shrimp was more susceptible to the offered baits and distances to the \n\nseafloor (1 \u2013 2 m). \n\nWhen fishing in areas with high scavenging activity, the possibility of attraction by the bait \n\nscavengers, rather than the bait itself, needs to be considered. In the study area the presence of \n\nscavengers in the bait pockets, mainly small amphipods and isopods, was frequent (Fig. 8). This \n\nsituation may justify the capture of a few individuals of DWS. In Kapiris (2004) stomach \n\nanalysis revealed that isopods were the preferred food in \u201cquality and quantity\u201d. The scavenging \n\nactivity of isopods was very high and even after short trials of only a few hours, the bait was \n\ncompletely consumed, especially in the South-West (Fig. 8). In some cases, the whole trap was \n\ncovered by a thick layer of small scavengers (amphipods) and in other cases there were just \n\nbones left in the bait pockets. The accumulation of scavengers around the cages could have \n\nacted as an indirect bait to DWS. Several studies have proven that an increased scavenger \n\nactivity is typical of trawling dominated marine habitats. (Kaiser 2002; Thrush 2002). \n\nThe golden shrimp Plesionika martia  supports commercial fisheries in the tropical and semi-\n\ntropical Atlantic and Indo-Pacific at depth between 54 - 649 m (Gonz\u00e1les-G. 1986). In Portugal \n\n(Dore 1987) the distribution of P. martia  ranges between 180 and 680 m and experimental \n\nwork done in the Tyrrhenian Sea indicates peaks of abundance between 300 and 600 m on soft \n\nbenthic substrate (Maiorano 2002; Possenti 2007). Another Pandalidae species, Plesionika \n\nedwardsii, is targeted by trap fisheries in Atlantic Islands, namely the Canary Islands (Arrasate-\n\nL\u00f3pez J and Gonz\u00e1lez 2012) and in Cabo Verde (Gonz\u00e1les 2012). The traps used correspond to \n\none of the models used in this study (type C, conic, semi-floating traps), and the gear \n\nspecifications proposed were also taken in consideration in this work. \n\nAll successful fisheries of this type developed in the absence of trawling or even targeted virgin \n\nstocks, in the case of the oceanic Atlantic islands due to inexistence of a continental platform. \n\nGiven the results obtained in this study, a trap fishery targeting deep water crustaceans using \n\nsemi-floating traps does not seem to be viable on the Portuguese coast, and this may be the \n\nresult of depilated populations due to intensive fishing. \n\nFor the DWS Sobrino et al. (2005) stated that the specie is at least fully exploited or to some \n\nextent overfished. Supporting the latter is, the importance of DWS for the Portuguese demersal \n\ntrawling fleet in recent years, with catches rising continuously (Table 1, Fig 1). This is not only \n\ndue to the high abundance of the specie during some years, but also because of limitations set \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\nfor the other important target species, the Norway lobster. Consequently, the fishing pressure \n\nfor DWS is increasing and with it the mortality on bycatch species, such as the golden shrimp.  \n\nThe results of bait comparison for golden shrimp are very interesting. The exploitation of \n\ngolden shrimp in the Atlantic islands is done exclusively with bait composed of fatty fish \n\nspecies. In our study, besides fatty fish, chum (minced sardine) and light sticks were also used. \n\nChum showed to be more effective than the fish (Table 5), likely due to a more intense and \n\neasier to disperse odor. This increases the attraction area of the bait and produces higher catches. \n\nNevertheless, bait remains a critical issue in trap fisheries because part of it is composed by \n\nspecies that are deviated from human consumption and consequently the possibility of using \n\nlight is of the highest importance.  \n\nLight is used in pelagic long line fisheries for the attraction of squid in several fisheries in the \n\nSouth West Atlantic. It was also described as an attractant for the capture of krill and small \n\ncrustaceans for scientific purposes (Kawaguchi 1986). This results show the need of scientific \n\nstudies on the use of light as an attractant in crustacean fisheries. The properties of visual \n\npigments in DWS and golden shrimp are unknown but Hiller-Adams (1988) determined the \n\nvisual perception of four deepwater shrimp species (Oplophoridae and Penaedea) with similar \n\nbehavior (daily migrations) and overlapping depth spectrum. The maximum of absorbance was \n\ndetermined for all species between 450 \u2013 550 nm (blue to green light). The used light during \n\nthis experiment was yellowish therefore on the limit of perception for the named species. It is \n\nlegitimate to assume that better results would be obtained if light sources were improved. \n\nSimple laboratory experiments could help define more precise wave lengths to attract DWS or \n\ngolden shrimp.  \n\nAlso interesting was the fact that both DWS and golden shrimp, when present, showed up in \n\nclusters up to 10 in the same trap indicating that the distribution is patchy. A similar pattern \n\nwas observed for other crustaceans such as the squat lobster. Patchy distribution are described \n\nfor other bottom crustaceans such as the Norway lobster (Maynou 1998).  \n\nOn the bottom, along the South coast the outflow from the Mediterranean Sea is dominating \n\nthe current regime (Zenk and Armi 1990) while in the South-West the predominant currents are \n\ndirected poleward (Frouin et al. 1990). These currents can force the floating traps to lie too \n\nclose to the bottom or generate spinning or erratic movements that can prevent the animals from \n\nentering the traps or cause a fleeing behavior. This is also supported by the increased scavenger \n\nactivity around the traps in this regions (Fig. 8) \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\nRecent studies stress the risk of overfishing of fast growing populations even though they are \n\nconsidered to be more \u201crobust\u201d (Pinsky 2015). The  \n\nThe economic exploitation of pandalidae shrimp with traps in the Canary Islands and the Azores \n\nand prospecting results in Cape Verde, show that healthy stocks allow a n economically viable \n\ntrapping fleet, but that is not possible in direct competition with demersal trawling. An often \n\nobserved phenomena in fisheries is that intensified fishing practices are decreasing population \n\nabundance to such a degree that more sustainable gears become less viable or impossible \n\n(Watson et al 2013).  \n\nTo comply with the new Common Fisheries Policy and the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries, \n\nthe trawling intensity in Portuguese waters should be questioned facing that one of the two most \n\nimportant species, the Norway lobster, is considered bellow biologically safe limits by the ICES \n\n(Council Regulation No 2166/2005), resulting in decreasing TAC s (10% decrease every year \n\nform 405 tons in 2005 to 168 tons in 2014, with a slight recovery to 206 tons in 20151) and that \n\nDWS is facing a consistent decline in recent years. Until now the fishery is only managed by \n\ninput measures (limited licenses and closed season) but the rising importance and life cycle \n\ntraits of short lived species it should be considered to implement some kind of population \n\nassessment like in fisheries for DWS in the South-Central Mediterrenean to avoid overfishing \n\nor a collapse (Knittweiss et al. 2013) \n\nThe exploitation of deep water crustaceans with trawling is also relevant for the bycatch \n\nCampos et al. (2002) and Fonseca et al. (2005) proposed different mesh configuration and \n\nbycatch reduction devices with little acceptance from the producers. It should be stressed that \n\ncrustacean fisheries provide food catering the high value markets, with little nutritive value and \n\nat the same cause great environmental damage decreasing the sustainability of other fishing \n\ngears such as the fixed gears used by the polyvalent fleet. This is the case of hake, caught and \n\ndiscarded in large amounts by the crustacean fleet (Borges et al. 2001), while the hake fishery \n\nwith fixed gears was severely limited (Council Regulation No 2166/2005). \n\n  \n\n                                                           \n1 DGRM, 2015.

Conclusion \n \n\nThe system of exploitation and management of fisheries resources has been maintained in the \n\npresent state for decades, with little changes. Policy action is needed to resolve the situation. \n\nOne way could be the implementation of additional areas restricted to trawling and marine \n\nprotected areas, especially outside the six miles limit. This would allow the establishment of \n\nbase line studies to understand the effect of trawling and the setting of reference points. \n\nTrawling is a technologically simple process, by sweeping the seafloor all organisms living on \n\nor near the ground are swilled inside the net. All in all the only ecological factor important is to \n\nknow the whereabouts of the species. To use more sustainable passive gears, such as longlines \n\nor traps, sophisticated knowledge about the animal behavior, nutrition and life cycle \n\ninformation are needed. The efficiency of these fisheries depends largely on the knowledge of \n\nthese factors and the resulting m\u00e9tiers are highly specific and consequently very selective \n\ntowards the target species ad sizes. To introduce more sustainable fishing practices, knowledge \n\nof the ecology and behavior of the target species is required and financial and technical \n\nassistance for experimental work should be provided.  \n\nFurther laboratory experiments and field work are needed, for both species discussed. Video \n\nobservations and current measurements should be incorporated in future experiments to \n\ndetermine more precisely the behavior of the traps and target species. Studies on the daily \n\nmigration and feeding cycle of DWS are also important as well as the behavior of the species \n\nin relation to light. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\n6.
