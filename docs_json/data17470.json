Multiferroics combine simultaneously at least two of the three ferroic \nproperties: ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism and ferroelasticity. Magnetoelectric \nmultiferroics\u2019 ability of magnetic field manipulation via electric fields or vice \nversa can be extremely promising for information storage applications, leading \nto thinner, as well as flexible devices, with significantly high energetic \nefficiencies and elevated capacities. \nThe aim of this work is the preparation and characterization of bismuth ferrite \nporous thin films, having as further objective to be able to serve as matrices for \nfuture functionalization. The strategy of this work consists of: a) dense film \npreparation with varying deposition velocities, b) porous film preparation with \nvarying solution template quantities, inorganic precursor concentration and \ndeposition velocities. Annealing temperature studies were also required, for the \nobtainment of the desired properties and control of microstructure. The \nmethodologies for the film preparation in use were: a) sol-gel process, b) \nEvaporation Induced Self-Assembly (EISA), for the induction of porosity, and c) \ndip-coating technique. \nA series of dense films with varying deposition velocities were produced, \nserving as means of comparison for the porous thin films. Increasing the sol-gel \ndeposition velocity led to increasing thickness. Piezoresponse Force \nMicroscopy (PFM) characterization was conducted, revealing the expected \nferroelectric domains. By the same technique, local piezoelectric hysteresis \nloops were obtained, showing increase of polarization saturation with \nincreasing thickness. Lastly, magnetic moment measurements were carried out \nby the use of Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID), \npresenting decrease of remnant magnetization with increasing thickness. \nVarying template concentration was introduced in order to obtain a \nhomogenous porous network. Homogeneity and lack of cracks in the films were \nsuccessfully achieved, by decreasing solution template mass, for a given \nsolution concentration. Thermal treatment studies revealed loss of porous \nnetwork ordering at elevated annealing temperatures, required for the \nobtainment of crystallization and enhanced multiferroic properties. Local \npiezoelectric hysteresis loops showed increase of the effective piezoelectric \ncoefficient with increasing thickness. SQUID characterization presented \nincreasing remnant magnetization with increasing porosity. Lastly, increasing \ninorganic precursors concentration resulted in better control of porosity order \nand increase in the piezoelectric coefficient. \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\npalavras-chave \n\n \nFilmes porosos multiferroicos, sol-gel, dip-coating, microscopia de for\u00e7a de \npiezoresposta \n\nresumo \n\n \nUma enorme contribui\u00e7\u00e3o na comunidade cient\u00edfica da Engenharia de \nMateriais tem sido feita pela evolu\u00e7\u00e3o excecionalmente r\u00e1pida no \u00e2mbito dos \nmateriais multifuncionais. Os multiferr\u00f3icos combinam simultaneamente pelo \nmenos duas das tr\u00eas propriedades ferr\u00f3icas: ferroeletricidade, \nferromagnetismo e ferroelasticidade. Os multiferr\u00f3icos magnetoel\u00e9tricos que \npermitem a manipula\u00e7\u00e3o do campo magn\u00e9tico atrav\u00e9s do campo el\u00e9trico e vice \nversa s\u00e3o extremamente promissores para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es de armazenamento de \ninforma\u00e7\u00e3o, levando a dispositivos mais finos e flex\u00edveis com efici\u00eancia \nenerg\u00e9tica significativamente mais alta e elevadas capacidades. \nO objetivo deste trabalho \u00e9 a prepara\u00e7\u00e3o e caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de filmes porosos \nde ferrite de bismuto, com vista a serem capazes a uma futura funcionaliza\u00e7\u00e3o. \nA estrat\u00e9gia deste trabalho consiste: a) prepara\u00e7\u00e3o de filme denso variando a \nvelocidade de deposi\u00e7\u00e3o, b) prepara\u00e7\u00e3o de filme poroso variando o template \nda solu\u00e7\u00e3o concentra\u00e7\u00e3o do precursor inorg\u00e2nico, e velocidades de deposi\u00e7\u00e3o. \nOs estudos sobre temperatura de calcina\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m necess\u00e1rios, para a \nobten\u00e7\u00e3o das propriedades requeridas e o controlo da microestrutura. As \nmetodologias para a prepara\u00e7\u00e3o dos filmes foram: a) sol-gel, b) Evaporation \nInduced Self-Assembly, para a indu\u00e7\u00e3o da porosidade, e c) dip-coating. \nFoi preparada uma s\u00e9rie de filmes densos variando a velocidade de deposi\u00e7\u00e3o, \nservindo como meio de compara\u00e7\u00e3o para os filmes porosos. Aumento da \nvelocidade de deposi\u00e7\u00e3o resulta em aumento da espessura dos filmes. Foi \nutilizada a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o por piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), \nrevelando dom\u00ednios ferroel\u00e9tricos como esperado. Pela mesma t\u00e9cnica, foram \nobtidas curvas de histerese piezoel\u00e9tricas locais mostrando o aumento da \nsatura\u00e7\u00e3o da polariza\u00e7\u00e3o com o aumento da espessura. Por fim, as medidas \ndos momentos magn\u00e9ticos foram obtidos atrav\u00e9s do Superconducting \nQuantum Interference Device (SQUID), apresentando uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da \nmagnetiza\u00e7\u00e3o remanescente com o aumento da espessura. \nA varia\u00e7\u00e3o da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o do template foi introduzida de modo a obter uma \nporosidade homog\u00e9nea. A homogeneidade e aus\u00eancia de fissuras nos filmes \nfoi conseguida com sucesso pela diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da massa do template da \nsolu\u00e7\u00e3o, para uma determinada concentra\u00e7\u00e3o da solu\u00e7\u00e3o. Os estudos do \ntratamento t\u00e9rmico revelou a perda da porosidade ordenada para temperaturas \nmais elevadas, necess\u00e1rias para a obten\u00e7\u00e3o da cristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o e melhoria das \npropriedades multiferr\u00f3icas. As curvas de histerese piezoel\u00e9trica local \nmostraram um aumento do coeficiente efetivo piezoel\u00e9trico com o aumento da \nespessura. A caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o por SQUID apresentou um aumento da \nmagnetiza\u00e7\u00e3o remanescente com o aumento da porosidade. Por fim, o \naumento da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o dos precursores inorg\u00e2nicos resulta em um melhor \ncontrolo da ordem da porosidade e aumento do coeficiente piezoel\u00e9trico. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nI \n\n \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\nINDEX OF FIGURES ...........................................................................................................

Introduction \n\n Objectives 1.1\n\nPorous matrices have a great importance for a large range of applications. Firstly, \n\nthe presence of porosity can provide lighter devices. In addition, novel architectures can be \n\nachieved by the incorporation of diverse materials in the pores, producing multifunctional \n\nfilms. Importantly, these structures are ideal for the field of sensors and actuators, since \n\nporosity confers enhanced pyroelectric properties, by decreasing the dielectric constant, \n\nwhich results in increase in the figure of merit.[1,2] Lastly, for the case of \n\nantiferromagnetic materials, the high surface area owing to the porous network can result \n\nin elevated magnetization.[3,4] \n\nThis thesis aims at understanding the effect of porosity and thickness on the \n\nmultiferroic properties of Bismuth Ferrite (BiFeO3, BFO) thin films. For this purpose, a \n\nseries of BFO films were prepared, with varying porosity and thickness, having as a \n\nstarting and comparison point dense and relatively thick films (~300nm). \n\nFilms were prepared via a sequence of simple and low cost processes: sol-gel, \n\nEvaporation Induced Self-Assembly (EISA) and dip-coating for the deposition of the films \n\non silicon platinised substrates. The porosity was tailored by the polymer and inorganic \n\nprecursors concentration. Processing variables, as deposition, drying and annealing \n\ntemperatures, were modified for maximized control of the microstructure and properties. \n\n Structure of the Thesis 1.2\n\nThe thesis consists of 5 chapters. Chapter 2 is dedicated to the State of the Art, the \n\nfundamental theories and ideas, which led to the definition of the experimental strategy. \n\nChapter 3 comprises the detailed description of the experimental and the characterization \n\nprocedure used along this work. In Chapter 4, a comprehensive discussion of the obtained \n\nresults is conducted. Finally, in Chapter 5, general conclusions and proposed future work \n\nare presented.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 Introduction \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nStyliani Skiadopoulou          Myultiferroic Behaviour of Bismuth Ferrite Porous Thin Films \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\nState of the Art \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n5 \n\n \n\n2. State of the Art \n\n Microelectronics 2.1\n\nIf 50 years took us to get from the room-sized computer of the 60\u2019s to the 9 mm-\n\nthick ultra-books of the 00\u2019s, we are just on the threshold of the era of electrically \n\ncontrollable nanoscale storage, which will lead to thinner, lighter, portable and flexible \n\ndevices, with significantly high energetic efficiencies and huge capacities (Figure 2.1). \n\nFigure 2.1 Computer evolution from the 60\u2019s up to the 00\u2019s, with decreasing cost and \n\ndimensions and increasing capacity and velocity (adapted from reference [5]). \n\nAn enormous contribution to the scientific community of materials engineering is \n\nbeing made by the exceptionally rapid evolution of the field of multifunctional materials. \n\nThe limitations of Moore\u2019s law, which predicted the exponential increase over time of the \n\nnumber of components in integrated circuits,[6] have led to a high demand for alternatives \n\nin the field of microelectronics. Indeed, since 2007 the International Technology Roadmap \n\nfor Semiconductors [7] has been addressing the concept of functional diversification under \n\nthe title \u201cMore than Moore\u201d. As a consequence, the combination of the miniaturization of \n\nthe components (Moore\u2019s law) and the use of novel material architectures (\u201cMore than \n\nMoore\u201d) makes possible the integration of digital and non-digital functionalities into \n\ncompact systems. Within this context multiferroics hold great promise. \n\n  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n6 \n\n \n\nMultiferroics combine simultaneously at least two of the three ferroic properties: \n\nferroelectricity, ferromagnetism and ferroelasticity.[8\u201311] The magnetoelectric \n\nmultiferroics offer the ability of magnetic field manipulation via electric fields or vice \n\nversa. A wide range of applications, such as information storage, sensing, actuation and \n\nspintronics, await pioneering strategies of producing robust magnetoelectric coupling at \n\nroom temperature.[11]  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 Schematic simplification of the electric-driven magnetic recording mechanism \n\nin magnetic hard disk drive (adapted from Hu et al.[12]). \n\n \n\nData storage, probably the most crucial battlefield of the tough and consuming \n\nexpedition for miniaturization, is mainly focused on the development of Ferroelectric and \n\nMagnetic Random Access Memories (FeRAMs and MRAMs respectively), which have \n\nlimited efficiencies.[13] The use of multiferroics can provide electrically written and \n\nmagnetically read devices, thus faster, low-energy consumption and with a non-destructive \n\nmagnetic read operation. \n\nIn Figure 2.2, we can observe a simplified example of a magnetoelectric device on \n\na magnetic hard drive disk. By the application of an electric field E, opposite \n\nmagnetization domains are formed on the magnetic hard drive disk, corresponding to 0-1 \n\nmagnetic bits.[12] \n\nIn Figure 2.3, a Magnetoelectric Random Access Memory (MERAM) is presented, \n\nwhere an electric field E is applied on the magnetoelectric material (blue), inducing a \n\nmagnetic moment ?mME which provides a magnetic flux density B through a magnetic \n\nphase (grey).[14] A magnetic \u2018\u2019bit\u2019\u2019 is written on the moving track of the hard disk, which \n\nhas a constant velocity v. Switching of the magnetization direction corresponds to opposite \n\norientations, thus 0-1 magnetic bit configuration.   \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 Schematic representation of a Magnetolectric Random Access Memory \n\n(MERAM).[14] \n\nLastly, lead-based compounds, due to their excellent ferroelectric properties, have \n\ndominated the electronics field through the years. However, lead\u2019s high toxicity, in \n\ncombination with the lack of device recycling, leads to contamination of the soil, air, water \n\nand the human and animal population. High levels of lead concentration in the human body \n\ncan provoke a series of complications, culminating with madness. In addition, lead \n\nexposure is very dangerous for children, since it affects the neurodevelopment and it can \n\neven provoke lowering of the IQ.[15] For these reasons, the European Union, in 1 July of \n\n2006, banned the use of lead in some electronic equipment, under the Restriction of \n\nHazardous Substances.[16] Therefore, a significant support to a global environmental \n\nconsciousness has been made lately, propelling a generalized search for lead-free materials \n\nfor electronic applications. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n8 \n\n \n\n Ferroelectrics 2.2\n\nFerroelectrics correspond to insulating systems, which present two or more stable \n\nor metastable states of nonzero electric polarization in the absence of electric field, known \n\nas spontaneous polarization.[17\u201320] The polarization in a bulk or film is organized in \n\ndomains and, by reversing the applied electric field, switching of the domains\u2019 orientation \n\ntakes place. For a finite system, the polarization simply corresponds to the charge density, \n\nwhile for infinite crystalline structures, is the result of the integrated current through the \n\ntransformation of one variant to another, else known as Berry phase. Ferroelectrics belong \n\nto 10 polar point groups, a subcategory of the 20 non-centrosymmetric piezoelectric point \n\ngroups.[17]  \n\nThe ferroelectric phenomenon was firstly observed by Valasek in 1920.[19] \n\nInitially, the research was limited to the study of hydrogen-bonded materials, such as \n\nRochelle salt (Potassium Sodium Tartrate (KNaC4H6O6.4H2O)) and Monopotassium \n\nPhosphate (KH2PO4). In 1949, Barium Titanate\u2019s (BaTiO3) ferroelectric properties were \n\ndiscovered and the route for understanding ferroelectricity was simplified.  \n\nThere are various groups of materials that present ferroelectric properties. To name \n\na few: perovskites (BaTiO3, PbTiO3, BiFeO3, SrTiO3), trigonal paraelectrics (LiNbO3), \n\nlayered oxide ferroelectrics (Aurivillius phases consisting of layered bismuth oxides), other \n\nferroelectric oxide families (tungsten bronzes, boracites), magnetic ferroelectric oxides \n\n(hexagonal manganites, such as YMnO3), electronic ferroelectrics (BaBiO3, LuFeO4, \n\nYFeO4) and ferroelectric polymers (PVDF, liquid crystals).[17] \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n9 \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 2.4 Displacement of cation B in the perovskite structure ABO3 and the respective \n\ndouble-well potential of the two polarization states.[21] \n\nHowever, the most widely studied and used class of ferroelectrics in industry are \n\nthe perovskites. Their structure is ABO3, having cation A at the corners of the unit cell, B \n\nat the centre and O at the midpoint of each edge, creating an oxygen octahedra net, with B \n\nat the centre of each one of them (Figure 2.4). Not all perovskites present ferroelectric \n\nproperties, since the latter are intimately linked with the size and position of the oxygen \n\noctahedra. The ion fitting in a perovskite unit cell can be calculated by Eq.1, known as \n\nGoldschmid tolerance factor t, which corresponds to the ionic distance between cation A \n\nand its closest oxygen divided by the length of the octahedral edge: \n\n    \n     \n\n? (     )\n                 Eq. 1 \n\nwhere rA, rB and rO are the radii of the A, B and O ions respectively.[17] Depending on the \n\nionic radii, Eq. 1 yields three cases: cubic structure for t?1, hexagonal structures with small \n\npolar distortion for t>1 and orthorhombic or rhombohedral structures with strong polar \n\ndistortion for t<1. As seen in Figure 2.4, the vertical displacement of central cation B \n\nbreaks the symmetry of the cubic structure and, by changing the distribution of charge in \n\nthe unit cell, provokes polarization.[21] The double-well potential, also shown in Figure \n\n2.4, presents the two stable states (lower energy states) of the spontaneous polarization. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n10 \n\n \n\nAn important characteristic of ferroelectrics is the hysteretic behaviour of \n\npolarization with the application of an electric field.[22,23] In Figure 2.5, an almost ideal \n\ncase of hysteresis loop is presented. As the electric field is increased, polarization increases \n\nuntil a certain value, which corresponds to the saturation polarization PS. By removal of the \n\nbias voltage, a large part of the polarized regions maintain their distorted positions and, \n\nsubsequently, at zero field a remanent polarization PR is reached. The same behaviour is \n\nfollowed for the case of negative bias. The two points where the hysteresis loop meets the \n\nvoltage axis correspond to the forward and reverse coercive voltages, V\n+\n and V\n\n-\n \n\nrespectively. High values of the coercive field account for easily polarizable materials, \n\nwhich retain their polarization. Finally, the area of the loop provides the work necessary \n\nfor polarization switching.[22] \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 Schematic representation of a well-saturated electromechanical hysteresis loop. \n\nThe two axes represent the applied voltage V and the resulting polarization P. PS and PR \n\ncorrespond to the saturation and remanent polarization, whereas V\n+\n and V\n\n-\n to the forward \n\nand reverse coercive voltage.[22] \n\n  \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n11 \n\n \n\n Ferromagnetics 2.3\n\nThe magnetic behaviour of matter, thus attraction or repulsion of some materials by \n\nothers, owes its origin to the existence of magnetic moments throughout various material \n\nstructures.[24] Magnetic moments could be described as small magnets, with polar \n\ncharacter. As known by classical electromagnetism, movement of electrically charged \n\nelements generates magnetic fields. Therefore, the origin of magnetization (accumulation \n\nof magnetic moments in a material) is the orbiting and spinning electrons of the atoms \n\n(Figure 2.6).  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6 The two different origins of magnetic moment: (a) Orbiting electron and (b) \n\nElectron spin.[24] \n\nFerromagnetism is one of the five different existing magnetic behaviours of matter: \n\ndiamagnetism, paramagnetism, antiferromagnetism, ferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism, \n\nas shown in Figure 2.7 (diamagnetism is not included since no magnetic moments are \n\npresent with absence of magnetic field).[24,25] Ferromagnets owe their elevated and \n\nspontaneous magnetization to aligned magnetic dipoles, which maintain their orientation \n\neven when no magnetic field is applied. Paramagnetic materials reveal randomly oriented \n\nmagnetic moments, thus an approximately zero macroscopic magnetization, which at the \n\npresence of a magnetic field are rotated and aligned, resulting in increase of magnetization. \n\nAntiferromagnetism corresponds to a zero overall magnetization, since cancellation of the \n\nequally distributed antiparallel magnetic moments occurs (Figure 2.7). Lastly, \n\nferrimagnetic behaviour is similar to the antiferromagnetic, however, since different ion \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n12 \n\n \n\ntypes originate the magnetic moments, conferring them different magnitudes, total \n\nmagnetization is non-zero. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7 The different magnetic states of matter: paramagnetic, antiferromagnetic, \n\nferromagnetic and ferromagnetic.[25] \n\n \n\nLike in ferroelectrics, hysteresis loop is an unbreakable proof of the ferromagnetic \n\ncharacter. In Figure 2.8, magnetic induction B (corresponds to the magnetic flux density \n\nand is linearly related to the magnetization M) is presented as a function of the magnetic \n\nfield H for a ferromagnet and a ferrimagnet.[25] Both loops have hysteretic character. \n\nInitially, for zero magnetic field the magnetization is zero. With the increase of H, \n\nalignment of magnetic moments results in the increase of B, reaching a saturation point BS, \n\nwhen no further alignment is possible. The reverse process provokes a small decrease in B, \n\nhowever it never reaches zero, having instead a significant residual magnetization Br at \n\nH=O. For negative orientation of H, one gets negative orientation of B. The coercive \n\nmagnetic field HC corresponds to the point at which magnetization is switched, therefore \n\nhigher HC means high resistance in demagnetization. The outer loop, presenting larger BS, \n\nBr and HC, corresponds to a ferromagnet and the inner one to a ferrimagnet, since magnetic \n\nmoment cancellation attenuates magnetic behaviour, as discussed above. \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n13 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8 Hysteresis loop of a ferromagnetic (outer curve, large saturation and residual \n\nmagnetic induction, Bs and Br respectively) and a ferrimagnetic material (inner curve, low \n\nsaturation and residual magnetic induction, Bs and Br respectively).[25] \n\n \n\n A large variety of ferromagnetic materials have been studied and used for various \n\napplications. Apart from the conventional pure metals (Fe, Co, Ni) and rare-earth magnets, \n\na series of compounds present significant ferromagnetic properties, such as the alloy \n\nTbDyFe2 (Terfenol-D), the spinels ?-Fe2O3, CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4, the corundum ?-Fe2O3, \n\nthe manganites LaSrMnO3 and LaCaMnO3 and the magnetic semiconductors, like ZnO and \n\nGaN.[9,26] \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n14 \n\n \n\n Multiferroics 2.4\n\nFerroelectricity, ferromagnetism and ferroelasticity are defined by switching of the \n\nalignment of electric dipole-moment, electron spin and strain via electric, magnetic and \n\nstress fields, respectively.[11]  \n\nMultiferroic materials combine at least two of these three properties.[8\u201312,27] \n\nHowever, apart from this multifunctional character, multiferroics present the remarkable \n\nphenomenon of coupling the different properties, in a sense that the stimulating fields \n\n(electric, magnetic and stress) can also provoke the manifestation of the responses which \n\ndo not correspond to their counterparts (Figure 2.9). Consequently, an electric field E can \n\ninduce strain ? or magnetization M, a magnetic field B polarization P or strain ?, and, \n\nfinally, stress field ? polarization P or magnetization M, certainly depending on the \n\nmaterial characteristics.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9 Representation of multiferroicity concept, with the different cases of coupling \n\nthat can occur by the presence of the three different fields: electric, magnetic and \n\nstress.[27] \n\n2.4.1 Single-phase \n\nMagnetoelectric multiferroics correspond to the coupling of ferroelectricity and \n\nferromagnetism. In single-phase magnetoelectrics, the multiferroic behaviour is dominated \n\nby the linear magnetoelectric effect. In mathematical terms, partial derivation of the free \n\nenergy of a material F (given by Eq. 2) over the electric E and magnetic field H, results in \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n15 \n\n \n\nthe expressions for spontaneous polarization P\nS\n and magnetization M\n\nS\n, Eq. 3 and Eq. 4 \n\nrespectively: \n\n ( ?   ?? )       \n      \n\n    \n \n\n \n          \n\n \n\n \n           \n\n       \n \n\n \n           \n\n \n\n \n                          Eq. 2 \n\n  ( ?   ?? )   \n  \n\n   \n   \n\n                \n \n\n \n                             Eq. 3 \n\n  ( ?   ?? )   \n  \n\n   \n   \n\n                         \n \n\n \n                               Eq. 4 \n\nwhere i,j,k are the spatial coordinates, Fo the ground state free energy, ?o and ?o the \n\ndielectric and magnetic susceptibilities respectively, ?ij the linear magnetoelectric \n\ncoefficient and ?ijk and ?ijk third-order tensor coefficients.[27,28] The latter also can \n\nmanifest magnetoelectric effect, however of smaller range. The linear magnetoelectric \n\ncoefficient ?ij corresponds to magnetic field-induced polarization or electric field-induced \n\nmagnetization, as shown in Eq. 5: \n\n    \n   \n\n   \n \n   \n\n   \n               Eq. 5 \n\nHowever, contradictory theories concerning their basic physics principles result in \n\na very limited number of magnetoelectrics in nature.[9,11] The main reason for that fact is \n\nthat ferroelectric properties require strong insulators, whereas ferromagnets are principally \n\nconducting metals. Additionally, symmetry breaking in ferroelectrics, thus polarization, is \n\nprovided by the empty d shells, whereas partially filled d orbitals of transition metals are \n\nresponsible for magnetization. Intensive research is being made since the 70s, which has \n\nled to a series of recipes for single phase multiferroics.  \n\nThe most studied case is the perovskite bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3), which falls in the \n\nwider group of materials that combine two different cation types with the properties \n\nmentioned above. Another group is that of the non-centrosymmetric magnetic ordering \n\nwhich leads to the rise of polarization, even with the presence of atomic \n\ncentrosymmetricity, such as chromium chrysoberyl (Cr2BeO4), terbium manganite \n\n(TbMnO3), as well as the manganites TbMn2O5 and Ca3CoMnO6. A combination of polar \n\ntilts and rotations of the anionic sublattice which occurs in rare-earth manganites and in \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n16 \n\n \n\nbarium nickel fluoride (BaNiF4), also results in symmetry breaking, thus induction of \n\npolarization. Finally, attempts to provoke off-centering structures for cations with partially \n\nfilled d orbitals have been made via epitaxial strain.[11] \n\n2.4.2 Composites \n\nDue to the limited number of single-phase multiferroics, great efforts have been \n\nmade in order to develop composites, whose two or more components will present the \n\ndesired properties. It has been proved that the magnetoelectric coupling effect in \n\nmultiferroic composites can be significantly enhanced.[29\u201334] The architecture of these \n\ncomposites is mainly based in three different heterostructures: horizontal, vertical and \n\nparticulate (Figure 2.10).[8,9]  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.10 Illustration of the three multiferroic composite heterostructures: (a) \n\nParticulate, (b) Horizontal and (c) Vertical.[8] \n\nIn the last years, aiming at higher efficiencies and smaller dimensions, the scientific \n\ncommunity has focused particularly on nanostructures, decreasing the thickness and \n\nincreasing the interfaces between the two components. Therefore, as discussed in Section \n\n2.5.3, surface anisotropies together with coupled properties of composites\u2019 components, \n\nsuch as piezoelectricity and magnetostriction, can produce gigantic magnetoelectric \n\ncoefficients. Recently, Jahns et al.[35] presented a bilayer heterostructure of Aluminium \n\nNitride (AIN) and FeCoSiB coumpound, whose magnetoelectric coefficient reached the \n\nvalue of 9.7 kV/cm?Oe, the highest measurement ever recorded at normal pressure. \n\nFor such heterostructures, a series of ferroelectric (BaTiO3, PbTiO3, Pb(Zr,Ti)O3, \n\nBiFeO3) and ferromagnetic (CoFe2O4, NiFe2O4, ?-Fe2O3) materials have been combined. \n\nHowever, due to the toxic character of lead-based compounds,[15\u201317] despite their \n\nexcellent ferroelectric properties, more and more research groups are searching for lead-\n\nfree solutions.  \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n17 \n\n \n\n Bismuth Ferrite: The Model Multiferroic 2.5\n\nBiFeO3 (BFO) is the only single-phase multiferroic, presenting simultaneously \n\nmagnetic and ferroelectric order at room temperature, thus, as mentioned above, is the \n\nmost studied.[9,11,36\u201338] It exhibits a strong ferroelectric behaviour, however the \n\napparent antiferromagnetic order of magnetic moments results in weak magnetic response. \n\nConcerning its chemical behaviour, BFO is a metastable and off-stoichiometric compound, \n\neasily forming secondary phases, like Bi2O3, Bi2Fe4O9 and sillenite Bi25FeO39.[36] \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.11 Bismuth Ferrite unit cell structure with the oxygen octahedra rotation and the \n\nFe ion shifting.[39] \n\n2.5.1 Ferroelectricity \n\nBFO owes its ferroelectric properties to the two distorted perovskite blocks, \n\nconnected along the pseudocubic-[111], building a rhombohedral unit cell (Figure 2.11). A \n\nclockwise and a counterclockwise rotation of the two oxygen octahedra connected along \n\nthe [111], as well as a shift of the Fe ion also along the [111], are responsible for \n\nconferring spontaneous polarization. The Godschmid tolerance factor (Section 0) for BFO \n\nis equal to 0.88, which yields a rhombohedral or orthorhombic symmetry. BFO\u2019s \n\nferroelectric Curie temperature, or else the temperature at which the ferroelectric to \n\nparaelectric transition takes place, corresponds to 1100 K.[37,38] \n\nBFO\u2019s piezoelectric constant (d33) is substantially low, reaching a maximum of \n\napproximately 100?C/cm\n2\n, whereas other perovskites extend to 100-1000?C/cm\n\n2\n. The \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n18 \n\n \n\nreason for the presence of such a large difference is BFO\u2019s small dielectric constant at \n\nroom temperature, which corresponds to approximately 30. This can be easily understood \n\nby the definition of the effective piezoelectric coefficient, as shown in Eq. 6: \n\n \n\n   \n   \n\n \n  \n\n  \n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n                  Eq. 6 \n\n \n\nwhere s, P, E, Q and ? stand for strain, polarization, electric field, electrostrictive \n\ncoefficient and dielectric constant respectively. \n\nSince the value of Q does not diverge much from the ones of other perovskites, \n\ndielectric constant accounts for such behaviour. The dielectric constant evaluation is \n\ninseparably linked with polarizability measurements. The relatively small electric fields \n\nrequired for dielectric measurements cannot affect the highly saturated polarization at \n\nroom temperature, due to the elevated Curie temperature of BFO (1100K). Another \n\nassumption coming from experimental results places emphasis on the possible existence of \n\na difference between the A-site and B-site cation originated polarizations, with the A-site \n\ncase present at BFO being the lower.[37]  \n\nThis relatively small piezoelectric coefficient is also responsible for the weak \n\ncontribution of strain-induced polarization in epitaxially grown BFO thin films. As a result, \n\nan increase in effective piezoelectric coefficient with increasing film thickness is observed \n\n(Figure 2.12).\n \n[29] \n\n \n\nFigure 2.12 Effective piezoelectric coefficient as a function of film thickness for \n\nepitaxially grown BiFeO3 thin films.[29] \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n19 \n\n \n\nFinally, the [111] oriented polarization in BFO is bound to switching by the \n\napplication of an external electrical field. There are three possible rotations: 71\no\n, 109\n\no\n and \n\n180\no\n (Figure 2.13). The first two also result in the rotation of the antiferromagnetic planes, \n\nhence providing evidence for a magnetoelectric behaviour. The antiparallel case of 180\no\n \n\nfor symmetry reasons maintains the initial magnetic ordering. Zhao et al.[40] and \n\nZavaliche et al.[41] showed the influence of polarization rotation in the antiferromagnetic \n\ndomains, by the combination of Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) and \n\nPhotoemission Electron Microscopy (PEEM) techniques. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.13 The three possible rotations of polarization orientation in BiFeO3 by the \n\napplication of an external electric field.[40] \n\n2.5.2 Phase Transitions \n\nA great polemic prevails over the complex matter of phase transitions occurring in \n\nthe BiFeO3 structure. BFO\u2019s crystallographic structure determine both its ferroelectric and \n\nmagnetic properties, often in a way that the cause becomes the effect and vice-versa. This \n\nentanglement of causality, in combination with BFO\u2019s intricate magnetic behaviour and the \n\npresence of impurities, hinders the characterization process.[37,42] \n\nThe different BFO phases already observed and proposed by a series of techniques \n\nare: rhombohedral, orthorhombic, monoclinic and cubic. The ground phase, or referred to \n\nas ?-phase, corresponds to a rhombohedral crystal system (R3c). A ferroelectric to \n\nparaelectric transition at 825 \no\nC (~1100 K) is clearly detected, presenting simultaneously \n\nan impulsive volume contraction. However, the nature of this apparent ?-phase remains in \n\nquestion. Apart from the relatively safe agreement of the community for a centrosymmetric \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n20 \n\n \n\nstructure, the majority of X-Ray and Neutron Diffraction studies incline towards a mixed \n\nrhombohedral-orthorhombic phase. Propositions for the presence of tetragonal or \n\npseudotetragonal systems are mainly rejected due to the observed domain structure. \n\nFurthermore, the monoclinic case argument does not agree with the XRD patterns and the \n\nmost controversial rhombohedral symmetry retainment through the ?-? transition is \n\nprecluded by the occurrence of ferroelastic transition. The higher-temperature ?-phase \n\npresents a cubic symmetry, though usually obscured by the presence of parasitic phases, \n\nsuch as Bi2Fe4O9 and Fe2O3. Lastly, anomalies reported in dielectric constant \n\nmeasurements reveal low-temperature (50 K and 200 K) weak coupling, probably of \n\nmagnetic or magnetoelastic nature, as well as a possible magnetoelectric coupling at 370 \n\no\nC (30\n\no\nC bellow antiferromagnetic N\u00e9el temperature 673 K). \n\nA proposition of the possible phase transitions as a function of temperature and \n\npressure occurring in BiFeO3 is presented in Figure 2.14. A coincidence in the sequence of \n\nthe main occurring transitions (rhombohedral ? orthorhombic ? cubic) can be observed \n\nboth for temperature and pressure increase. There is a slight rise of the antiferromagnetic \n\nN\u00e9el temperature with increasing pressure.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.14 Phase transition diagram for BiFeO3 as a function of temperature and \n\npressure. Solid points correspond to experimental data. Blue region presents the \n\nferroelectric rhombohedral phase (R3c). Light red region represents the paraelectric ?-\n\nphase, primarily suggested by the majority as a rhombohedral-orthorombic mixed phase or \n\nthe less supported monoclinic. White region shows the cubic ?-phase and along the black-\n\ngreen line the metal-insulator transition. Green line indicates the antiferromagnetic to \n\nparamagnetic transition (N\u00e9el temperature).[37]  \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n21 \n\n \n\n2.5.3 Magnetism \n\nA combination of various scenarios seems to give rise to the complex magnetic \n\nbehaviour of BFO. \n\nOne of the most widely accepted theories is that of G-type antiferromagnetic \n\nordering, resulting from the ferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically ordered Fe \n\nmagnetic moments along the [111] axis and between the adjacent planes, respectively \n\n(Figure 2.15(a)).[37,43] BFO\u2019s antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition happens at \n\nthe antiferromagnetic N\u00e9el temperature of 673K.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.15 (a) G-type antiferromagnetic order in BiFeO3. (b) Spin cycloid order with \n\nwavelength period of 64nm. (c) Cycloidal spin-induced polarization and magnetoelectric \n\ncoupling due to change in the orientation of the cycloid plane by 71\no\n rotation in \n\npolarization.[44] \n\nMost studies are based on Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which corresponds to \n\nthe spin-exchange accompanied by spin-orbit coupling, leading to canting of the magnetic \n\nsublattices.[43] The latter phenomenon together with the rotation of the oxygen octahedra \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n22 \n\n \n\nyields weak macroscopic ferromagnetism. The lattice distortion impact on BFO\u2019s \n\nferromagnetic character can be also understood by the relatively low Godschmid tolerance \n\nfactor (Section 2.5.1), a fact that allows for buckling of the oxygen octahedra, hence \n\nchange in the angle between Fe-O-Fe.[37]  \n\nAnother proposal for the apparent magnetic activity in BFO, first published by \n\nSosnowska et al.[45], is the presence of a cycloidal spin arrangement of the \n\nantiferromagnetic sublattices, following a wavelength period of 64nm and propagating \n\nperpendicularly to [111] pseudocubic axis (Figure 2.15(b)). Suppression of the cycloidal \n\nspin structure, due to epitaxial strain in thin films[43] or grain-particle size[3,4,46,47], can \n\nlead to the emergence of uncompensated magnetic moments. In addition, this long-range \n\nsuperstructure can result in the induction of an additional polarization, giving rise to \n\nmagnetoelectric coupling.[44] As shown in (Figure 2.15(c)), a rotation by 71\no\n in \n\npolarization orientation can result in change in the magnetic cycloid plane, providing \n\nstrong evidence for magnetoelectric coupling. In bulk architectures cycloid spin structure \n\ncan induce canting angles of 2.25\no\n, introducing a significant contribution to the overall \n\nmagnetoelectric effect. In thin films, cycloidal magnetic moment order appears to result in \n\nsmaller canting angles (~0.2\no\n), leaving Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya interactions accounting for \n\ncoupling manifestation. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.16 (a) Polarization and (b) magnetization magnitude as a function of ferroelectric \n\ndomain wall thickness x.[48] \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n23 \n\n \n\nFurthermore, ferroelectric domain walls appear to play an important role to \n\nmagnetization generation, as shown by Privratska et al.[49] and later by Darakrchiev et \n\nal..[48] The symmetry breaking and lack of homogeneity in domain walls can produce \n\nsignificant spontaneous magnetization (Figure 2.16). This fact is accentuated by the \n\nconsiderable occupying volume fraction of walls in thin films, due to smaller grain sizes. \n\nIn addition, Kay-Dunn law reveals a power dependence between the domain wall thickness \n\nd and the resulting coercive electric field E, as can be seen in Eq. 7: \n\n       \n \n \n\n                Eq. 7 \n\n \n\nAs wall thickness decreases, higher fields are generated and the anisotropy degree is \n\nsubstantially increased, hence enhanced magnetoelectric coupling can occur. \n\nFinally, as mentioned above, any anisotropy may lead to the rise of magnetism, \n\namong which the megnetocrystalline, surface and shape related are the most \n\nimportant.[50,51] For the case of thin films, perpendicular surface anisotropy can be \n\nresponsible for ferromagnetic ordering, even for antiferromagnetic materials. Surface \n\ninfluence in anisotropy is much stronger than that caused by volume fractions, a solid \n\nexplication for the comparable magnetizations observed between bulk and thin films. \n\nWang et al.[29] in 2003, showed that magnetization increases with decreasing film \n\nthickness in BFO thin films. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.17 Magnetization of BFO films as a function of film thickness.[29] \n\n  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n24 \n\n \n\n The Strategy for Porous Thin Film Preparation 2.6\n\n2.6.1 Sol-gel Process \n\nA plethora of thin film preparation techniques has been developed over the years, \n\nsuch as Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE), Pulsed Layer Deposition (PLD), Radio \n\nFrequency Sputtering (RFS), Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOC-VD), \n\nChemical Solution Deposition (CSD), to name a few.[9] The latter corresponds to a simple \n\nand cost-effective chemical method and consists of the preparation of a solution and its \n\nsubsequent deposition on a substrate.  \n\nThe sol-gel process, one if the CSD methods, corresponds to the hydrolysis of \n\ninorganic or metal organic reactive precursors in aqueous or organic solvents, followed by \n\ncondensation reactions, which result in the so-called gel.[38,52,53] \n\nSol is a colloidal suspension of well dispersed solid particles in a liquid.[54] Due to \n\nthe small dimensions of the dispersed phase, Van der Waals forces and surface charge \n\ninteractions surpass the gravitational field influence. Gel corresponds to a porous three-\n\ndimensional solid network and, depending on the medium that fills the pores, it can be \n\naquagel, hydrogel, alcogel, aerogel or cryogel. The various steps of the sol-gel procedure \n\nare the following: preparation of a homogeneous solution, conversion to sol, gel formation \n\n(polycondensation), gel shaping (thin films, fibres, spheres or grains) and sintering.[54] \n\nFor the case of a metal alkoxide M(OR)n with valence n, the following reactions \n\ntake place: \n\n \n\nM(OR)n + H2O ? M(OR)n-1 OH + ROH           (Hydrolysis) \n\nM(OR)n-1 OH+ M(OR)n ? (RO)n-1 M-O-M (OR)n-1 + ROH    (Condensation) \n\n \n\nThe first reaction corresponds to the hydrolysis of the alkoxy groups and the second one to \n\nthe polycondensation. The result is a gel with a mixture of weakly bonded polymers and \n\nhighly condensed particles.[53] \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n25 \n\n \n\n2.6.2 Dip-coating Deposition \n\nSome of the deposition techniques for the preparation of thin films are spray-\n\ncoating, meniscus-coating, dip-coating and spin-coating.[55] One of the most widely used \n\nis dip-coating, mainly due to its simplicity, the ability of producing homogenous films with \n\ncontrolled thickness, the lack of waste and, certainly, its low-cost.[52,53,56] \n\nFor film deposition via dip-coating, the substrate is dipped into the sol-gel and \n\nsubsequently withdrawn at a constant speed.[56] Since sol-gel\u2019s nature is non-newtonian, \n\nevaporation of the solvents takes place during deposition, which is determinant for the film \n\nformation. Many factors are influenced by the evaporation mode, such as viscosity, \n\ndensity, surface tension, pH and local accumulation of precursors. Another important \n\nfactor that necessitates scholastic control is the hydrolysis and condensation reaction \n\nkinetics taking place throughout the whole procedure, until the final heat treatment, which \n\naffect the degree of condensation, the density and the species\u2019 structure. \n\nIn Figure 2.18 (a), one can observe the gradual evaporation of the solvents, the \n\nformation of meniscus and the decrease of the film thickness, during the deposition. \n\nAlthough, phenomenologically, we expect an increase in the thickness by increasing \n\nwithdrawal velocity due to draining phenomenon, in reality, there are two regimes that \n\ngovern the process: a capillary/evaporation regime for very low withdrawal velocities and \n\na draining/evaporation regime for higher values (Figure 2.18 (b, c)). The first behaviour is \n\nowing to capillary phenomena, which lead to a linear evaporation, thus obstruction of \n\notherwise expected draining. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n26 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.18 (a) Schematic illustration of sol-gel process. (b, c) The two different regimes \n\ntaking place through dip-coating method: (b) capillary and (c) draining, for slow and fast \n\nfilm withdrawing, respectively.[56] \n\nFaustini et al.[56] conducted a comparison between an experimental procedure \n\n(using a sol-gel derived from the mixture of tetraethyl and methyltriethyl orthosilicates \n\nwith Pluronic F127 copolymer), a capillarity model and a draining model, as shown in \n\nFigure 2.19. There is a very good correlation between the experimental results and the \n\ncombination of the two models incorporating the capillary and draining regimes. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.19 Thickness of the deposited film as a function of withdrawal speed. Draining, \n\ncapillary and combination of the two models are presented along with an experimental sol-\n\ngel deposition points.[56] \n\n(a) (b) (c) \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n27 \n\n \n\n2.6.3 Evaporation Self-Induced Assembly (EISA) \n\nThere are various chemical and physical methods for the induction of porosity in \n\nthin films, however, Evaporation Induced Self-Assembly (EISA) is one of the most \n\npopular, owing to its simplicity and rapid production of patterned pores.[57\u201359] EISA is \n\nbased on the use of micellar and lyotropic liquid-crystal phases, which act as templates, \n\nregulating the nucleation, growth, morphology and orientation of inorganic crystals, and, \n\nafter evaporation during the thermal treatment, eventually, they form periodically \n\norganised porous structures.[55,57,60]  \n\nAs shown in Figure 2.20, there are 4 main steps during the EISA process: solvent \n\nevaporation, which ends with the gel formation, water equilibrium, mesostructuration, \n\nwhich result in the hybrid organic/inorganic structure and, finally, condensation through \n\ntreatment and removal of the templates. Throughout the whole procedure, overlapping of \n\nthe different stages might occur. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.20 Schematic illustration of the different steps occurring through the evaporation-\n\ninduced self-assembly for the formation of mesoporous structures.[55] \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n28 \n\n \n\nThe templates consist of hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts. The hydrophilic tails \n\nare selectively brought in contact with water, bringing the hydrophobic ones shielded \n\nwithin the spherical or cylindrical micelle. \n\nBy increasing the templates molecular weight and, as the critical micelle \n\nconcentration has been exceeded, spherical and cylindrical micelles are formed, thus \n\ndifferent pore sizes can be produced (Figure 2.21). Further increasing of the templates \n\nconcentration, periodic hexagonal, cubic or lamellar structures can be achieved.[57]\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.21 Presentation of the different geometries for cetyltrimethylammonium boride \n\n(CTAB) as a function of temperature and surfactant concentration.[57] \n\n  \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n29 \n\n \n\n Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) 2.7\n\nPiezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM), currently one of the most popular \n\ntechniques of ferroelectrics\u2019 characterization via Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM), \n\nallows a nondestructive visualization of domain structures at the nanoscale in thin films \n\nand bulk materials. \n\n2.7.1 Historical Review \n\nThe historical starting point for the wider family of Scanning Probe Microscopy \n\ntakes place in 1981, with the invention of Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) by Gerd \n\nBinnig and Heinrich Rohrer, to whom subsequently the Nobel Prize in Physics was \n\nattributed in 1986 for their so-called \u201ccandid cameras of the nanoworld\u201d.[61,62] STM\u2019s \n\nfunction is based on the quantum-mechanical phenomenon of electron tunnelling, \n\noccurring by the application of a relatively small electric potential between an atomically \n\nsharp conducting tip and the surface of a conducting or semi-conducting sample. By \n\nmeasuring the resulting current of those electrons that manage to overcome the barrier, the \n\ntopography of the sample surface can be given down to atomic resolution. In 1990, the \n\nworld\u2019s smallest logo was created by such a microscope. I.B.M.\u2019s initials were formed by \n\narranging 35 individual xenon atoms (Figure 2.22).[63] That was the moment that the \n\nmessage was passed along even outside the scientific community and \u201csneaking\u201d into the \n\natomic world became \u201cmessing\u201d with the actual atoms! \n\n \n\nFigure 2.22 The world\u2019s smallest logo. I.B.M.\u2019s initials presented by 35 individual xenon \n\natoms, by the use of Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) (image published in 1990 by \n\nEigler &amp; Schweizer in Nature [63], but artistically adapted by IBM Research [64]). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n30 \n\n \n\nHowever, STM\u2019s limitation to conducting and semi-conducting materials, lead to \n\nthe development of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), in 1986 by Binnig et al..[65] This \n\ntime the basic functioning principle is even simpler, since the only measurement is the \n\ndeflection of the tip as it passes over the sample surface, therefore no conduction is needed \n\nand the range of materials is substantially widened, particularly for the ample field of \n\nbiomolecular analysis. Different modes have been developed since, such as contact, non-\n\ncontact and tapping mode, to mention the most important ones, depending on the material \n\nand the properties in question. \n\nIn 1991, Birk et al. publish the first measurements made by Piezoresponse Force \n\nMicroscopy (PFM) for Vinylidenefluoride Trifluoroethylene (VDF-TrFE) thin films.[66] \n\nIn 1992, Guthner et al. refer to a new ferroelectric storage technique (write-read) by local \n\npoling, as well as the crucial ferroelectric domain size effect due to tip geometry and film \n\nthickness. However, the systematic studies carried out by Gruverman et al.[67,68] \n\nhighlight the importance and utility of PFM technique for a profound insight into the \n\nferroelectric behaviour of materials. \n\n2.7.2 Principles of Operation \n\nPFM technique is based on a very simple method, yet without preventing high \n\naccuracy and reliability. The general idea derives from the principles of inverse \n\npiezoelectric effect, or else the conversion of electrical energy to mechanical. In that way, \n\nthe measurement is realized by detecting the electromechanical interaction between the \n\nsample surface and a conductive tip, induced by the application of an external ac \n\nvoltage.[67,68]  \n\nAFM technique is grounded in Hooke\u2019s law and the oscillatory behaviour of the \n\nforce sensor, which consists of two parts: a cantilever-type spring with position parallel to \n\nthe sample surface and a sharp tip placed at the edge of the cantilever perpendicularly to \n\nboth surface and cantilever (Figure 2.23 (a, b)). A laser beam is deflected on the top-side \n\nof the cantilever and, subsequently collected by a Position Sensor Detector (PSD), usually \n\na quadrupole-electrode geometry photodiode (Figure 2.23 (c)). The detection precision \n\ncorresponds to sub-\u00c5 scale. A piezoelectric scanner with nanometric precision is \n\nresponsible for the sample movement relative to the tip, allowing for lateral and vertical \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n31 \n\n \n\nmovements. In order to achieve a topography image, the cantilever deflection must be kept \n\nconstant. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.23 (a) Schematic illustration of cantilever-tip geometry and position.

Fdefl, Fbuck and \n\nFtor are the forces which result in tip\u2019s deflection, buckling and torsion effects respectively. \n\n(b) Cantilever\u2019s vertical deflection, buckling and torsion effects. (c) Vertical (caused by \n\nFdefl and Fbuck) and lateral (Ftor) signals of cantilever movement detected by a quadrupole-\n\nelectrode geometry of the detector (PSD).[69] \n\n As mentioned above, there are various AFM modes for the obtainment of different \n\ninformation. For the case of piezoelectricity, contact mode is necessary for sensing the \n\nvibration of the sample surface. Surface reaction to the applied field is characterized by \n\nshort-range repulsive interatomic forces, thus the contact requirement, unlike the non-\n\ncontact case, intended for the detection of long-range interactions, such as magnetic, \n\nelectrostatic and Van der Waals.[68] \n\n The external voltage applied between the tip and the surface consists of a dc and an \n\nac component, as shown in Eq. 8: \n\n                                        Eq. 8 \n\nwhere ? is the frequency of ac component. A lock-in technique is used to modulate the \n\noutput signal, in a sense that topographic and piezoresponse signals to be separated, \n\nproviding the two images simultaneously. For a homogeneously polarized material, the \n\nvertical displacement under voltage V, as a function of the piezoelectric and \n\nelectrostrictive coefficients, d33 and Q33 respectively can be expressed as: \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n32 \n\n \n\n         \n   \n\n \n              Eq. 9 \n\nwhere t is the sample thickness.[70] Since lock-in technique does not measure the dc \n\ncomponent, the vertical displacement ?z via Eq. 8 becomes: \n\n         (       )   \n    \n\n \n      (       )           Eq. 10 \n\nwhere ? the phase difference between the ac input and the piezoreponse output signal, \n\nrelated to the polarization direction.[20] Eq. 10, corresponds to the first harmonics of the \n\nsignal and its first part is linked to the piezoelectric effect. The second part, as well as the \n\nsecond harmonics can be neglected, since they are basically related to the electrostrictive \n\neffect, which is much weaker and it only produces a dc offset. Thus, a PFM image is \n\ncomposed by: \n\n             (    )           Eq. 11 \n\nDepending on the information in question, both mapping of amplitude d33Vac and phase ? \n\ncan be conducted. \n\n A series of reasons have established PFM technique as one of the most accepted \n\nand popular methods for the investigation of piezoelectric properties. Firstly, its high \n\nspatial resolution, lack of special sample preparation and normal conditions operation lead \n\nto cost and time-effective studies. In addition, its high vertical sensitivity prevents any \n\ndestructive considerations. A variety of phenomena linked with piezoelectric behaviour \n\ncan be easily studied, such as switching mechanisms, writing-reading in micrometric scale, \n\nmicrostructure-domain correlation, domain wall investigation and degradation effects. \n\nImportantly, as mentioned before, it gives the opportunity of a simultaneous representation \n\nof the surface topography and the piezoelectric response. By choosing the adequate \n\ncantilever-tip, one can work with a wide range of surface roughness and hardness. \n\nFurthermore, contact mode is not susceptible to screening effects, usually caused by charge \n\nabsorption when non-conduct, hence no veiling of domain mapping can occur. It should be \n\nmentioned that PFM imaging is favourably used for thin film characterization than bulk \n\ncases, due to lack of uniformity of the applied electric field. Lastly, the ability of \n\nmeasuring piezoelectric properties locally at a nanoscale provides an insight to more \n\ncomplicated structures, such as polycrystalline or inhomogeneous samples.[67,68,71] \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n33 \n\n \n\n2.7.3 PFM Studies of Bismuth Ferrite \n\nBFO\u2019s good ferroelectric behaviour, and most importantly its large remanent \n\npolarization, allows for extended studies via PFM technique. Compared to pure \n\nferroelectrics, BFO\u2019s multiferroic character induces bigger domains, due to \n\nmagnetoelectric coupling occurring at the domain walls.[48,72]  \n\nThree main domain structures have been observed in BFO thin films by the use of \n\nPFM technique. For film thicknesses of about a few hundreds of nanometres, the domain \n\npatterns are mostly striped (Figure 2.24 (a)). However, decrease in the thickness originates \n\nan irregular domain structure, accompanied by a fractal configuration along the domain \n\nwalls (Figure 2.24 (b)). Mosaic-like structures are observed by domain imaging of \n\npolycrystalline samples, such as films deposited via sol-gel method (Figure 2.24 (c)).[73]  \n\n   \n\nFigure 2.24 The three main domain structures observed by PFM in BFO thin films: (a) \n\nStriped and (b) irregular domains in epitaxially grown thin and ultrathin films \n\nrespectively,[37] and (c) mosaic-like in polycrystaline sol-gel deposited thin film.[73] \n\nAs mentioned in Section 2.5.1, the three polarization rotations, taking place by the \n\napplication of the electric field, were studied by Zavaliche et al.[32,74] and are presented \n\nin Figure 2.25. In-plane PFM images show a higher contrast between the domains, due to \n\npolarization orientation. An external dc electric field of -12V magnitude was applied to the \n\nsamples. The dark square in Figure 2.25 (b) denotes the poled area, thus much more \n\nintense in the out-of-plane imaging. Relevant pattern can be observed also for the \n\nrespective in-plane piezoeresponse in Figure 2.25 (c). In Figure 2.25 (c, d, e) we can see \n\nclearly the three polarization rotations: P1\n-1\n\n switches to P1\n+1\n\n and P3\n-1\n\n by 180\no\n and 71\n\no\n \n\nrespectively and P4\n-1\n\n is rotated by 109\no\n. \n\n(a) (b) (c) \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 State of the Art \n\n34 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.25 (a, b) Out-of-plane and (c. d) in-plane PFM images, before (a, c) and after (b, \n\nd) poling of the sample with the application of -12V dc.

The bars are of 1?m.[41] \n\nMagnetic Force Microscopy is based on a combination of tapping and non-contact \n\nmode, for topography and magnetic response mapping of the same area, by the use of \n\nmagnetically coated conductive tips. However, unlike PFM technique, the two images are \n\nnot taken simultaneously. The tip after taking the tapping signal of one scanning line, \n\ndraws further from the surface in order to detect magnetic interactions.  \n\nUnfortunately, the antiferromagnetic nature of BFO makes impossible the \n\nvisualization of magnetic domains via Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM). Nevertheless, \n\nthe magnetoelectric coupling in composite heterostructures, such as the ferromagnetic \n\nCoFe2O4 nanopilars in BiFeO3 matrix shown in Figure 2.26, is of great interest and it \n\nproduces good description of magnetic domains, originated by the nanopilars, and their \n\nswitching under dc bias of -16V. \n\n     \n\nFigure 2.26 MFM images of magnetized CoFe2O4-BiFeO3 vertical heterostructure (a) \n\nbefore and (b) after poling at -16V.

Experimental Procedure \n\nIn this chapter the experimental procedure conducted in this work is described. It \n\nconsists of three main parts: i) the preparation of dense thin films with varying withdrawal \n\nvelocities, ii) the preparation of porous thin films with varying solution template \n\nconcentration and withdrawal velocities, accompanied by annealing temperature studies, \n\nand iii) the characterization tools and strategy (Figure 3.1). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 Schematic representation of the strategy of the current work. \n\n  \n\nDense Films Porous Films \n\nWithdrawal \n\nVelocity \n\nVariation \n\nAnnealing \n\nTemperature \n\nVariation \n\nTemplate \n\nConcentration \n\nVariation \n\nWithdrawal \n\nVelocity \n\nVariation \n\nSolution \n\nConcentration \n\nVariation \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 Experimental Procedure \n\n38 \n\n \n\n Dense Films 3.1\n\nThe preparation of dense films basically aims at obtaining means of comparison \n\nand reference point for the properties of porous films, which is naturally the main subject \n\nof this work. Although during the whole procedure of this work, a series of approaches to \n\nprepare dense films have been conducted, the most effective one will be reported. \n\nFor the obtainment of the dense films, three main steps were followed: i) sol-gel \n\npreparation, ii) dip-coating deposition, and iii) drying and annealing (Figure 3.2). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 Flow diagram for the preparation of dense films. \n\n3.1.1 Sol-gel Process \n\nFor the preparation of the sols the following reagents were used: bismuth (III) \n\nnitrate pentahydrate (Aldrich, purity ?98%), iron (III) nitrate nonahydrate (Aldrich, purity \n\n98%), 2-methoxyethanol (Aldrich, purity 99.8%) and pluronic F127 copolymer (Polymer \n\nSource, purity 100%). The procedure was based on the strategy followed by Coondoo et \n\nal.[73], yet with some alterations. The sols were prepared with a concentration of 0.5 M, \n\n0.2 mL final volume and 1:1 stoichiometry for the two inorganic precursors, iron (III) \n\nnitrate nonahydrate  (Fe(NO3)3.9H2O) and bismuth (III) nitrate pentahydrate \n\n(Bi(NO3)3.5H2O). Each precursor was dissolved with 0.1 mL of 2-methoxyethanol \n\n(C3H8O2), left stirring for 30 min and subsequently the two solutions were mixed. The \n\nmixture was kept at constant stirring for 1 h, unlike the case of Coondoo et al. that propose \n\na 24 h stirring. Both procedures were tested, however no differences were observed. \n\nAnother adjustment to the referred strategy was the introduction of a small quantity of \n\nFe(NO\n3\n)\n\n3\n?9H\n\n2\nO \n\n+ \n\nC\n3\nH\n\n8\nO\n\n2\n \n\nBi(NO\n3\n)\n\n3\n?5H\n\n2\nO \n\n+ \n\nC\n3\nH\n\n8\nO\n\n2\n \n\n+ \n30min \n\nStirring \n30min \nStirring \n\n1 hour \nStirring \n\nmixture \n\ndip-coating \ndrying \n\nannealing \n\n3min-300\no\n\nC \n\n5min-550\no\n\nC \n\n30min \nStirring \n\n+5mg \n\npolymer hot-plate \n\n2min-120\no\n\nC \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 3 Experimental Procedure \n\n39 \n\n \n\nPluronic F127 copolymer, aiming at the enhancement of the adhesion of the sol on the \n\nsubstrate. For that purpose, 5 mg of copolymer were added to the mixture of the two \n\nprecursors, followed by 30 min stirring (Figure 3.2). The mass and volume quantities used \n\nfor the three-step procedure, until obtaining the final solution, are presented in Table 3.1. \n\nTable 3.1 The three steps of sol-gel preparation with used reagents mass and volume \n\nquantities and respective purity and suppliers. \n\n Reagents Mass (g) Volume (mL) Purity Brand \n\nPrecursor 1 \nBi(NO3)3.5H2O 0.2425 - ?98% Aldrich \n\n2-Methoxyethanol - 0.1 99.8% Aldrich \n\nPrecursor 2 \nFe(NO3)3.9H2O 0.2020 - 98% Aldrich \n\n2-Methoxyethanol - 0.1 99.8% Aldrich \n\nFinal Solution Pluronic F127 0.0050 - 100% \nPolymer \n\nSource \n\n3.1.2 Dip-coating Deposition \n\nDip-coating technique was used for the film deposition, mainly due to its \n\nsimplicity, time and cost-efficiency, as well as the production of homogeneous thickness, \n\nas mentioned in Section 2.6.2. The same methodology was employed for dense and porous \n\nfilms. The dip-coater used for the deposition was from KSV, model DC/D/LM, adapted \n\nwith a homemade drying chamber. \n\nPrior to the deposition step, the Pt(111)/TiO2/SiO2/Si(100) substrates were cut in \n\nrectangles of 2 cm x 1 cm and subsequently ultrasonically cleaned with ethanol (EtOH) \n\nand acetone during 10 min respectively. \n\nOne of the main parameters studied for the preparation of the films was the drying \n\ntemperature, employed to maximise the adhesion of the sol on the substrate. High \n\ntemperature during the deposition, between 40 and 90 \no\nC depending on the solvents in use, \n\nfacilitates the solvent evaporation process, allowing for domination of the viscous drag \n\nupon gravity forces, thus inducing a faster growth of the film.[56] For that purpose, a \n\ntemperature controller was adjusted to the dip-coater, in such way that the substrate would \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 Experimental Procedure \n\n40 \n\n \n\nbe under constant temperature along the entire withdrawal trajectory. After testing the \n\ndeposition at 40, 50 and 70 \no\nC, the last one was used, as it resulted in better adhesion for all \n\nthe range of withdrawal velocities. \n\nBased on Faustini et al. studies [56], six different withdrawal velocities were used, \n\nas seen in Table 3.2. These values correspond to low, medium and high velocities. The \n\npurpose was to develop films with increasing thickness, as discussed in Section 4.1. \n\nTable 3.2 Dip-coating withdrawal velocities and respective sample identification. \n\nSample Identification Withdrawal Velocities (mm/min) \n\nD5 5.58 \n\nD10 10.58 \n\nD29 29.58 \n\nD45 45.66 \n\nD150 150 \n\nD180 180 \n\n3.1.3 Drying and Annealing Process \n\n A variety of drying and annealing profiles were studied, since preparing a dense \n\nstructure without changing significantly the porous film-based recipe proved to be \n\nsubstantially difficult. Indeed, it was verified that the polymer used as adhesion regulator \n\nled to the formation of pores and cracks. Thus, a more controlled procedure for evaporation \n\nof solvents and polymer removal was followed.  \n\nApart from the temperature control during deposition, two drying steps were \n\nintroduced before annealing. Immediately after the deposition, the film was placed on a \n\nhot-plate at 120 \no\nC for 2 min and subsequently fired at 300 \n\no\nC for 3 min.[73] Finally, the \n\nfilms were annealed at 550 \no\nC for 5 min in air, in order to establish the required \n\ncrystallization. As discussed in Sections 4.1 and 4.2.2, mainly due to dense-porous \n\ncomparison reasons, the films were additionally annealed at 600 \no\nC for 5 min. \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 3 Experimental Procedure \n\n41 \n\n \n\n Porous Films 3.2\n\nThe porous thin film preparation procedure consists also of three main steps: i) sol-\n\ngel process, ii) dip-coating deposition, and iii) annealing (Figure 3.3).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 Flow diagram for the preparation of porous thin films. \n\n \n\n3.2.1 Sol-gel Process \n\nThe sol-gel process for the case of porous thin films differs from that of dense, \n\nprincipally due to the introduction of the templates, employed for the induction of porosity. \n\nThus, the initial solutions for the inorganic precursors are prepared as for the dense case, \n\nyet with different quantities for solids and solvent (Table 3.3 and Table 3.4). \n\nThe template used in this task is polystyrene-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) \n\nblock copolymer, which consists of two polymer blocks, a hydrophilic (PEO) and a \n\nhydrophobic (PS). Its polymer molecular weight is 40,000 g/mol (PS) - 53,000 g/mol \n\n(PEO) (Polymer Source). The template dissolution was realized by the use of \n\ntetrahydrofuran (THF, Aldrich, purity ?99.5%) and ethanol (EtOH, Panreac, purity P.A.). \n\nPEO and PS present relatively similar degree of affinity with THF, thus the latter is \n\ninitially introduced, resulting in the formation of a homogeneous solution with the \n\ncopolymer chains separated. By adding EtOH, which has a hydrophilic character, the PEO \n\npart of the chain is oriented towards the EtOH molecules and the PS parts, being \n\nhydrophobic, are approached to each other. The result of this molecular rearrangement is \n\nthe formation of micelles, which are composed by a central PS sphere and an outer co-\n\ncentral PEO cell (Figure 3.4).[75]  \n\nFe(NO\n3\n)\n3\n?9H\n\n2\nO \n\n+ \nC\n\n3\nH\n\n8\nO\n\n2\n \n\nBi(NO\n3\n)\n3\n?5H\n\n2\nO \n\n+ \nC\n\n3\nH\n\n8\nO\n\n2\n \n\n+ \n30min \n\nStirring \n30min \n\nStirring \n\n5 hour \nStirring \n\nmixture \n\ndip-coating \ndrying \n\nannealing \n\n5min-400\no\n\nC \n\n5min-550\no\n\nC \n\n30min \nStirring \n\nPS-b-PEO \n+ \n\nTHF \n+ \n\nEtOH \n\n+ \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 Experimental Procedure \n\n42 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 Schematic illustration of a micelle formed by PS-b-PEO block copolymer.[76] \n\n \n\nIn order to achieve equilibrium between the two activities and prevent precipitation, \n\nmainly provoked by surpassing the critical micelle concentration due to EtOH excess, a \n\nvolume ratio between THF and EtOH of 1:3 is required. In order to assist the dissolution \n\nprocedure, for each solvent step the solution was kept in the oven at 60 - 70 \no\nC for 10 - 15 \n\nmin, depending on the template concentration. When the template solution was sufficiently \n\ndissolved, the mixture of the inorganic precursors was introduced drop by drop, avoiding \n\nsudden expansion of micelles, caused by the polar character of 2-methoxyehtanol. As \n\ndiscussed in Sections 2.6.2 and 2.6.3, the formation of micelles is a continuous procedure, \n\nwhich lasts until the final thermal treatment, thus it is influenced by every step and its \n\nrespective parameters, such as solvents character and quantities, dip-coating withdrawal \n\nvelocity and temperature and, finally, thermal treatment.  \n\nTwo principal studies were conducted for the case of porous thin films; the role of \n\nthe concentrations of: a) the template and b) the inorganic precursors, which implied \n\nadjustments in the initial solution. For the first case, 5 different solutions with varying \n\ntemplate quantities and fixed inorganic precursors concentration of 0.3 M were produced \n\n(Table 3.3). For the second case, three different solutions with varying concentrations and \n\nfixed template mass at 30 mg were prepared (Table 3.4).  \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 3 Experimental Procedure \n\n43 \n\n \n\nTable 3.3 Series of solutions with respective reagents quantities for the case of template \n\nconcentration study, with fixed inorganic precursors concentration of 0.3 M. \n\nSample \n\nIdentification \n\nTemplate \n\nMass \n\n(mg) \n\nBi(NO3)3.5H2O Fe(NO3)3.9H2O C3H8O2 THF EtOH \n\nP60 60 \n\n0.1455 g 0.1212 g \n\n0.67 mL \n\n+ \n\n0.67 mL* \n\n0.17 mL 0.5 mL \n\nP48 48 \n\nP36 36 \n\nP30 30 \n\nP24 24 \n\n*The quantities referred are for each inorganic precursor. \n\n \n\nTable 3.4 Series of solutions with the respective reagents quantities for the case of the \n\ninorganic precursors concentration study, with fixed template mass of 30mg. \n\nSample \n\nIdentific\n\nation \n\nConcentration Bi(NO3)3.5H2O Fe(NO3)3.9H2O C3H8O2 THF EtOH \n\nP0.3 0.3 M 0.1455 g 0.1212 g 0.67 mL \n\n+ \n\n0.67 mL* \n\n0.17 mL 0.5 mL P0.4 0.4 M 0.1940 g 0.1616 g \n\nP0.5 0.5 M 0.2425 g 0.2020 g \n\n \n\n* The quantities referred are for each inorganic precursor. \n\n3.2.2 Dip-coating Deposition \n\nThe step of sol-gel deposition on substrates is similar to that of the dense films, \n\ndiscussed in Section 3.1.2, however the used temperature deposition was 90 \no\nC, based on \n\nthe studies discussed in Section 4.2.1. For the investigation of the withdrawal velocity \n\neffect on the multiferroic properties of porous thin films the selected solution was that of \n\n0.3 M concentration of the inorganic precursors and 24 mg of solution template mass, since \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 Experimental Procedure \n\n44 \n\n \n\nit presented the best results concerning the porous network ordering.

Initially, the \n\nchosen temperature was 400 \no\nC for 5 min, aiming at the removal of the templates. \n\nSubsequently, the films were annealed at 550 \no\nC and 600 \n\no\nC for 5 min each, in order to \n\nstudy the multiferroic properties for both temperatures. \n\nNevertheless, since the disappearance of the ordering of the porous structure was \n\nobserved at elevated temperatures, required for the crystallization of the films, two \n\nannealing temperature/time studies were conducted for the case of sample P30 (Section \n\n4.2.2). For the first case, the films were annealed at 400, 450, 500, 550, 600 and 650 \no\nC for \n\n5 min each, in order to observe the effect of the annealing temperature on the \n\nmicrostructure development. The second study aimed at investigating the effect of \n\nannealing time on the crystallization and densification of the sample. In this case the films \n\nwere annealed at 450 and 500 \no\nC for 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 min for each temperature. \n\n  \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 3 Experimental Procedure \n\n45 \n\n \n\n Characterization 3.3\n\nThe structural, microstructural and ferroic properties of the thin films were assessed \n\nthrough a series of characterization methods.  \n\nCrystallinity and formed crystalline phases of the annealed films were characterized \n\nby X-Ray Diffraction, using Philips X-Pert MPD equipment, with Cu-K? X-Ray radiation \n\nand ? = 1.5406 \u00c5. \n\nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) mainly serve for microstructure and \n\nthickness characterization. The equipment used for SEM characterization was Hitachi\u00ae \n\nmodel S4100, and in some cases Hitachi\u00ae model SU-70. The acceleration voltages utilized \n\nfor dense and porous films were 15 and 25 kV respectively, since higher values permit a \n\nbetter penetration for a 3D visualization of the porous network.  \n\nThe study for the presence of BFO\u2019s rhombohedral phase presence was assisted by \n\nRaman Spectroscopy. The equipment used was JY Horiba LabRam model HR800, with a \n\nhigh resolution 800 mm focal length spectrometer. The laser beam utilized was Argon at \n\n532 nm (Ventus). \n\nFerroelectric properties were investigated via Piezoresponse Force Microscopy \n\n(PFM). The microscope used was Veeco, equipped with Nanoscope III, Digital \n\nInstruments. The silicon cantilever-tips used were coated with Al, produced by \n\nNANOSENSORS\nTM\n\n model PPP-NCHR, with length of 125 ?m, resonant frequency of 204-\n\n497 kHz and force constant of 10-130 N/m. \n\nMagnetic properties were measured by Superconducting Quantum Interference \n\nDevice (SQUID). The measurements were conducted under constant temperature at 300 K \n\nand for varying magnetic field. The equipment used was Quantum Design \u2013 MPMS \n\n(Centro de F\u00edsica Mat\u00e9ria Condensada, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias, Universidade de Lisboa). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nStyliani Skiadopoulou            Multiferroic Behaviour of Bismuth Ferrite Porous Thin Films \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\nResults and Discussion \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion \n\n49 \n\n \n\n4. Results and Discussion \n\n BiFeO3 Dense Films 4.1\n\nAs mentioned in Section 3.1.1, a series of efforts were conducted in order to \n\nprepare the necessary BFO dense thin films, our reference point for the investigation of the \n\nrole of porosity. In order to create the best possible conditions, so that a reasonable \n\ncomparison between the two structures could be made, the same preparation conditions \n\nwere used, i.e. the same type of solvents and same annealing temperatures.  \n\nHowever, due to the weak adhesion of the sol on the substrate, a small amount of \n\nPluronic F127 polymer (5mg) was added. Since in this case some porosity was observed, \n\nan extra drying step was applied, by placing the deposited film on a hot-plate at 120 \no\nC for \n\n2 min, prior to the thermal treatment for template removal and crystallization annealing, as \n\nproposed by Coondoo et al.[73]. Deposition temperature control (70 \no\nC), in combination \n\nwith the immediate contact with the hot-plate, and the subsequent treatment at 300 \no\nC for 3 \n\nmin, solved the problems of pore occurrence, for medium and high withdrawal velocities. \n\n4.1.1 Effect of Withdrawal Velocity on Film Thickness \n\nTable 4.1 presents the different cases of withdrawal velocities used for the \n\npreparation of dense films, together with the respective thicknesses, as measured by the \n\ncross-section SEM images (Figure 4.1), with the help of the image processing program \n\nImageJ. Sample D100 was not characterized, mainly due to stabilization difficulties on the \n\nsample holder. Cross-section images require perpendicular positioning of the sample and \n\nowing to disproportionate dimensions, there is always a small movement during the \n\nacquisition of the images, resulting in distortion of the real dimensions. It should be \n\nmentioned that some inhomogeneity was detected in the film thickness, thus the \n\nthicknesses presented in Table 4.1 were calculated as the average of measurements taken \n\nin various positions of the cross-section SEM images.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion \n\n50 \n\n \n\nTable 4.1 Dip-coating withdrawal velocities and respective thicknesses for BFO dense \n\nfilms, annealed at 600 \no\n C. \n\nSample Identification Withdrawal Velocities (mm/min) Thickness (nm) \n\nD5 5.58 100 \u00b1 14 \n\nD10 10.58 125 \u00b1 6 \n\nD29 29.58 195 \u00b1 10 \n\nD45 45.66 215 \u00b1 8 \n\nD100 100 - \n\nD150 150 230 \u00b1 7 \n\nD180 180 285 \u00b1 6 \n\n \n\nD5 D10 D29 \n\n   \n\nD45 D150 D180 \n\n   \n\nFigure 4.1 Cross-section SEM images for dense BFO films prepared with different \n\nwithdrawal velocities ranging from 5.58 to 180 mm/min.

Thickness increases with increasing withdrawal velocity, \n\nmeaning that the velocities chosen belong to the draining regime (Section 2.6.2, Figure \n\n2.19).[53,56] Lower velocities were also tested, however due to adhesion problems the \n\nfilms presented inhomogeneous zones with clear difference in deposited mater, hence \n\nthickness.  \n\nIn Figure 4.2, the effect of the withdrawal velocity on the film thickness is \n\npresented. A logarithmic scale was used for the x-axis and the units are presented in mm/s, \n\ninstead of mm/min that appear in Table 4.1, in order to be able to make a comparison with \n\nFaustini et al.[56]. As shown in Section 2.6.2, the draining regime exists for withdrawal \n\nvelocities higher than 0.1 mm/s, which is also observed for the current case. However, no \n\ndirect conclusions can be made concerning the limits of the draining regime. Undoubtedly, \n\nwithdrawal velocity-thickness relation depends on the nature of solvents, precursors, \n\nsolution viscosity, chamber temperature and humidity. In addition, no lower withdrawal \n\nvelocities were possible to investigate, which gives no clues about the capillary regime for \n\nthe specific solution. Importantly, viscosity measurements are required for inclusion of \n\nsuch extreme values of withdrawal velocities. \n\n0.1 1\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n \n\nT\nh\n\nic\nk\nn\n\ne\ns\ns\n (\n\nn\nm\n\n)\n\nWithdrawal Velocity (mm/s)\n \n\nFigure 4.2 Withdrawal velocity effect on thickness for the BFO dense thin films, showing \n\nincrease of film thickness with increasing withdrawal velocity. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion \n\n52 \n\n \n\nIn Figure 4.3, the top view SEM microstructures of the BFO films for different \n\nwithdrawal velocities are presented. For higher velocities that correspond to thicker films a \n\nmore dense structure was obtained and samples D29, D45, D100 and D150 show a \n\nconsiderably higher densification, apart from some inhomogeneity in grain distribution and \n\nthe appearance of some individual pores. At these velocities, the draining regime \n\ndominates and the films are thicker. Drying process in thicker films lasts longer, since it \n\noccurs with the evaporation of the exterior surface and, apart from the increase of the gel \n\naging time, there is more time for the particle ordering.[53] However, samples D5 and \n\nD10, deposited at lower withdrawal speeds, present a clear porous structure. This can be \n\nexplained by the fact that at low withdrawal velocities, at which capillary forces start to \n\ninfluence the solvent-inorganic precursor interaction, solvent evaporation occurs faster \n\nthan the motion of the drying line between the vapour, the liquid and the solid phase.[56] \n\nThis results in inhomogeneous film formation. \n\nD5 D10 D29 \n\n   \n\nD45 D100 D150 \n\n   \n\nFigure 4.3 Top view SEM micrographs of BFO dense films prepared with different \n\nwithdrawal velocities and annealed at 600 \no\nC.

All films present \n\nthe main peaks of the rhombohedral phase of BFO. The peak appearing at around 29 2? \n?\n \n\ncan be attributed to the Bi2Fe4O9 secondary phase, with cubic structure and (121) \n\norientation. The flattening close to 46 2? \n?\n can be due to a combination of the Pt peak with \n\norientation (200) and the BFO monoclinic phase, which presents three intense peaks in that \n\nregion. However, also monoclinic BiFeO3 and rhombohedral Fe2O3 impurities can \n\ncontribute for the occurrence of multiple peaks close to that region, concerning the \n\nrhombohedral and monoclinic phases of BiFeO3, as well as the secondary phases. Since \n\nD150 film is thicker (230 nm thick), more intense peaks are visible, whereas for the D5 \n\ncase (100 nm thick), substrate clamping could have provoked the formation of off-\n\nstoichiometric phases, as well as monoclinic symmetry. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4 XRD patterns of dense BFO films, 100, 195 and 230 nm thick (samples D5, \n\nD29 and D150) and annealed at 600\no\nC. \n\n  \n\n20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60\n\n \n\n \n\nIn\nte\n\nn\ns\nit\ny\n (\n\na\n.u\n\n.)\n\n2?

All images were composed with \n\ndetection of the vertical signal, thus imaging of out-of-plane polarization was conducted. \n\nThe amplitude of the applied ac voltage was 5 V and the frequency 50 kHz. \n\nAs shown in Figure 4.5, the first column corresponds to the topography image and \n\nthe second to the piezoresponse. Topography basically images the film surface, where \n\nlight regions correspond to heights and dark ones to lows. However, due to the use of \n\ncontact mode, required for the monitoring of piezoelectric behaviour, size effects take \n\nplace resulting in misrepresentation of the real grain size and morphology of the sample in \n\ninvestigation. \n\nThe PFM images are composed by dark, medium and light domains. The first \n\ncorrespond to ferroelectric domains with substrate-oriented polarization (downwards, \n\nnotation ?) and the light ones to tip-oriented polarization (upwards, notation ?) (Figure \n\n4.5). The medium domains could result owing to a series of cases.[68] Firstly, the \n\npolycrystalline nature of thin films produced via sol-gel process induces a random \n\npolarization. Integration of the piezoelectric response over film thickness results in zero \n\ntotal polarization. In addition, the relatively small grains, comparing to the film thickness, \n\ntend to reinforce polarization annihilation, since naturally domains are related with the \n\ngrain structure. The latter statement should not be confused with topography-piezoresponse \n\ncorrelation, which in order to reveal truthful piezoelectric response demands independence \n\nbetween the two images. In other words, domain contrast should not coincide with grain \n\ncontrast, which is related to the topography. Another case, usually characteristic of the \n\nstripe-like epitaxial BFO thin films (Section 2.7.3), is that of the in-plane oriented \n\ndomains, which of course for the case of out-of-pane imaging have very low or even zero \n\ncontribution. Furthermore, lack of polarized domains could result from the highly complex \n\nmultiphasic character of BFO, with the occurrence of non-ferroelectric phases \n\n(orthorhombic, monoclinic and cubic), secondary phases and impurities (Section 2.5.2). \n\nLastly, if the amplitude of the ac voltage used for the visualization of the domains is close \n\nto the magnitude of the coercive field, switching of the polarization could take place, \n\nfollowing the same frequency, thus producing no domain contrast. \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion \n\n55 \n\n \n\nThe topography and PFM images for samples with increasing thickness D5, D29 \n\nand D150 are presented in Figure 4.5. The samples were annealed at 600 \no\nC. All samples \n\npresent similar domain geometry and distribution. The domain configuration appears to be \n\ncontinuous, apart from the case of D29, which presents some areas with no response, \n\nmainly due to topography anomalies, as can be confirmed by the respective topography \n\nimage. \n\n Topography Image PFM Image \n\nD5 \n\n  \n\nD29 \n\n  \n\nD150 \n\n  \n\nFigure 4.5 Topography and PFM images of 5?m x 5?m scanning area for samples with \n\nincreasing thickness of 100, 195 and 230 nm (samples D5, D29 and D150 respectively), \n\nannealed at 600\no\nC.

Although BFO\u2019s piezoelectric coefficient is smaller than other perovskites, \n\nas referred in Section 2.5.1, the domains present high intensity and relatively large size, \n\npossibly due to the multiferroic character of BFO and the occurring magnetoelectric \n\ncoupling taking place mostly at the domain walls, as discussed in Sections 2.5.3 and 2.7.3. \n\nBFO films with 230 nm thickness (sample D150) were thoroughly studied, due to a \n\nmore regular and homogenous surface morphology. In Figure 4.6, the topography and \n\nPFM images for different scanning areas of 5 ?m x 5 ?m, 3 ?m x 3 ?m, 2 ?m x 2 ?m and 1 \n\n?m x 1?m are shown. Upwards and downwards polarized domains are equally distributed, \n\nhowever the appearance of regions with intermediate contrast is highly frequent.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion \n\n57 \n\n \n\n Topography Image PFM Image \n\n5?m x 5?m \n\n  \n\n3?m x 3?m \n\n  \n\n2?m x 2?m \n\n  \n\n1?m x 1?m \n\n  \n\nFigure 4.6 Topography and PFM images of 230 nm thick BFO dense film (sample D150) \n\nannealed at 600 \no\nC. \n\nThe relatively low roughness of the surface makes the verification of genuine \n\ndomains less complicated, since irregular topography can provoke artefacts in the \n\npiezoresponse image, easily confused with ferroelectric domains. To avoid such confusion, \n\nareas in the topography image presenting homogenous grain colour (thus situated at the \n\n1.0\u00b5m 1.0\u00b5m\n\n600nm 600nm\n\n400nm 400nm\n\n200nm 200nm\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion \n\n58 \n\n \n\nsame height) were chosen and correlated with the respective area in the PFM image. If \n\ndomains with contrast can be observed for such a region, then the domains in question \n\ncorrespond to real ferroelectric domains. \n\nFigure 4.6 depicts the smaller scanning areas (2 ?m x 2 ?m and 3 ?m x 3 ?m) of \n\nsample D150, taken by zooming in the first image (5 ?m x 5 ?m), except for the case of \n\n1?m x 1?m. Domain structure, of course apart from the loss of resolution due to \n\namplification, maintains exactly the same morphology and contrast. \n\nSmall scanning areas also facilitate the local piezoelectric hysteresis loop \n\nmeasurements. The latter technique is based on the application of dc voltage pulses, which \n\nare subjected to a loop-like increase and decrease of the amplitude, with the necessary \n\napplication of negative potential, for induction of polarization switching. In order to carry \n\nout these measurements, a ferroelectric domain should be chosen and the tip should stand \n\nstill to a specific point on the domain. Hence, amplification of domains makes sure that the \n\ntip will be standing on a ferroelectric domain and not on a non-ferroelectric one or an inter-\n\ndomain region. \n\nFigure 4.7 presents the dc voltage pulses applied for the measurement of the local \n\npiezoelectric hysteresis loop, with pulse duration of 2 seconds and intervals of zero voltage \n\nof 1 second. Apart from the dc voltage required for the stimulation of piezoelectric \n\nbehaviour, an ac field is applied simultaneously, mainly for the detection of the film \n\nreaction during the zero voltage intervals between the pulses. This ac voltage should be \n\nrelatively low comparing to the dc bias, so that polarization removal would be avoided \n\nduring piezoresponse reading. The small ac voltage had amplitude of 2 V and 50 kHz \n\nfrequency. The maximum dc voltage was of 15 V and the step between each pulse is 1.5 V. \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion \n\n59 \n\n \n\n0 30 60 90 120\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n \n\nd\nc \n\nV\no\nlta\n\ng\ne\n (\n\nV\n)\n\n \n\nFigure 4.7 Dc voltage pulses applied for the local piezoelectric hysteresis loop \n\nmeasurements.

High thickness corresponds to large grain and crystallite size, which results in \n\nthe slightly stronger piezoelectric response. Nevertheless, thickness is a macroscopic \n\ncharacteristic of the films, whereas the current piezoresponse measurements are local, \n\nwhich implies that no absolute and direct correlation can be made. In some cases, \n\nimpurities and elevated inhomogeneity can result in the formation of highly polarized \n\ndomains, while at the same time large regions of the film present zero piezoresponse. The \n\npiezoelectric coefficient measured in these cases reaches even higher values than those \n\nobserved in the thickest films (~230nm). \n\n \n\n4.1.4 Magnetic Characterization Results \n\nThe magnetic properties of dense BFO films were measured by Superconducting \n\nQuantum Interference Device (SQUID). In order to subtract the substrate signal from the \n\none produced by the film, a measurement of the magnetization of the substrate under the \n\nsame magnetic field variation and the same temperature (300 K) was carried out. \n\nThe magnetic moment measurements at 300 K for the BFO films have great \n\nimportance, revealing for this model case of single-phase magnetoelectric multiferroic the \n\nuniqueness of room temperature multiferroic behaviour. A mass normalization is normally \n\nrequired, in order to present the apparent magnetization related to a specific amount of \n\nmatter. For the current measurements the samples were cut in squares of 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm. \n\nUnfortunately, no easy and approachable technique was possible to be followed in order to \n\nmeasure the quantity of the mass deposited on such small areas. Hence, in all the SQUID \n\nresults presented in this work, the magnetic response is given by the total magnetic \n\nmoment measurement. As a result, a comparison with magnetization values referred in \n\nliterature cannot be made. \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion \n\n61 \n\n \n\n-60000 -40000 -20000 0 20000 40000 60000\n\n-4.0x10\n-4\n\n-2.0x10\n-4\n\n0.0\n\n2.0x10\n-4\n\n4.0x10\n-4\n\n \n\n \n\n D150\n\n D29\n\n D5\n\n?\n (\n\ne\nm\n\nu\n)\n\nH (Oe)  \n\n100 150 200\n\n0.00000\n\n0.00004\n\n0.00008\n\n0.00012\n\n0.00016\n\n \n\n \n\n?\nr \n\n(e\nm\n\nu\n)\n\nThickness (nm)\n \n\nFigure 4.9 (a) Magnetic moment measurements under magnetic field variation at 300 K \n\nfor BFO dense films of 100, 195 and 230 nm thickness (samples D5, D29 and D150 \n\nrespectively), annealed at 600 \no\nC. (b) Remanent magnetization as a function of thickness \n\nfor the dense samples D5, D29 and D150. \n\nIn Figure 4.9, the magnetic moment measurements of samples with increasing \n\nthickness D5, D29 and D150 are presented. The antiferromagnetic behaviour displays an \n\napproximately linear relation between the applied magnetic field and the resulting \n\nmagnetization and it dominates the magnetic response at higher magnetic fields. The \n\nmagnetization increasing rate with the application of the magnetic field corresponds to the \n\nantiferromagnetic susceptibility of the material. For low magnetic fields, one can observe \n\nthe manifestation of a slight hysteretic behaviour due to uncompensated magnetic \n\nmoments.  \n\nAn intense difference can be observed for the case of 100 nm thick BFO films \n\n(sample D5), in comparison to the other samples. This can be interpreted by the possible \n\noccurrence of impurities, as discussed in Section 4.1.2, which could present ferromagnetic \n\nbehaviour, resulting in the emergence of the low field weak ferromagnetic response. \n\nFurthermore, the highly porous microstructure observed for these films can be an \n\nadditional factor for such a divergence. As discussed in Section 2.5.3, large surface \n\nanisotropies due to low film thickness, in combination with high roughness, relatively \n\nsmall grains (average size of 30nm), low crystallinity texture and possible presence of out-\n\nof-plane surface spin structure, give rise to uncompensated magnetic moments, thus \n\nincreased magnetization.[3,4,46,47] As a result, decrease of remanent magnetization with \n\nincreasing film thickness can be observed in Figure 4.9 (b).  \n\nD5 \n\nD29 D150 \n\n(a) (b) \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion \n\n62 \n\n \n\nIn Table 4.2, the antiferromagnetic susceptibility ?AF and the remanent \n\nmagnetization ?r are presented for the BFO dense films 100, 195 and 230 nm thick \n\n(samples D5, D29 and D150). The antiferromagnetic susceptibility, characteristic of the \n\nmaterial and derived from the slope of the graph at high magnetic field values, should have \n\nbeen the same for all the samples. However, since the total magnetic moment measured \n\nwas not normalized concerning the mass contribution, there is a slight increase with \n\nincreasing withdrawal velocity, due to the thickness increase. The samples\u2019 magnetic \n\nresponse can be obtained by the remanent magnetization, which corresponds to the point at \n\nwhich the referred slope line meets the y-axis. Nevertheless, this assumption should be \n\nconsidered with care, due to the possible error introduced by the lack of normalization in \n\nthe antiferromagnetic susceptibility. \n\nTable 4.2 Antiferromagnetic susceptibility and remanent magnetization for samples D5, \n\nD29 and D150, annealed at 600 \no\nC. \n\nSample Identification Thickness (nm) ?AF (10\n-10\n\n emu/Oe) ?r (10\n-5\n\n emu) \n\nD5 100 \u00b1 14 50 \u00b1 0.2 15.7?\u00b1 1.5\n \n\nD29 195 \u00b1 10 4.32?\u00b1 0.2\n \n\n1.65?\u00b1 1.5\n \n\nD150 230 \u00b1 7 7.86?\u00b1 0.2\n \n\n0.63?\u00b1 1.5\n \n\n \n\nSummarising for the BFO dense films, increase in withdrawal velocity results in \n\nincreasing thickness, which leads to increase in the local piezoelectric coefficient d33 and \n\ndecrease in the remanent magnetization ?r. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.10 Schematic representation of the withdrawal velocity effect on thickness and \n\nmultiferroic properties for the series of dense films. \n\nDense Films \n\n?

All the BFO films are \n\nvisibly porous and the size and degree of order of the porosity varies with the content of \n\nthe polymer. It is clearly visible that as the content of polymer increases the porosity of the \n\nfilms increases, but pore organization is also directly affected by the polymer content. An \n\nenhanced degree of order was obtained for the films with the lowest content of polymer, \n\nthe cases of P30 and P24 films. For the films with the highest polymer content (sample \n\nP60), the excess of template lead to the coalescence of the porosity and also to the \n\nformation of bigger pores in comparison with the films prepared with lower polymer \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion \n\n64 \n\n \n\ncontents. P48 films show an organised network of pores with the biggest pore size among \n\nthese organised pore networks; the pore size was calculated to be ~ 74 nm. It is also visible \n\nand related with the amount of the template that in this case the pore walls are thinner than \n\nfor the films with lower polymer amounts. As the polymer content decreases the pore size \n\ndecreases and the pore organization increases. \n\nPore size, porosity density and surface porosity contribution were calculated by the \n\nSEM images (Figure 4.11) by the use of the image processing program Image J, as \n\npresented in Table 4.3. The pore size corresponds to the pore diameter. The porosity \n\ndensity was measured as the number of pores for a specific area. Finally, surface porosity \n\ncontribution was calculated by the ratio between the surface area occupied by the pores and \n\nthe total area of the film. Calculation of the actual porosity density along the whole film \n\nvolume was very difficult, since cross-section SEM images lacked resolution. Thus, the \n\npresented densities correspond to the surface porosity density and not to the bulk density. \n\nP60 P48 P36 \n\n   \n\nP30                                P24 \n\n       \n\nFigure 4.11 SEM micrographs of BFO porous films P60, P48, P36, P30 and P24, \n\ndeposited with a velocity of 29.58mm/min and annealed at 400\no\nC. \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion \n\n65 \n\n \n\nIncreasing the template quantity resulted in increasing pore size and decreasing \n\nporosity density (Figure 4.12 (a) and (b) respectively).

The increase of template mass in the solution caused increase of the pore size and \n\ndecrease of porosity density. As a result, the formation of larger grains was allowed for \n\nsamples with lower degree of pore distribution, and since the most intense domains were \n\nselected for the current study, higher piezoelectric coefficients were detected for samples \n\nP24 and P60.

The results show the \n\nopposite behaviour of what was expected, as increase in remanent magnetization with \n\ndecreasing porosity contribution is presented. In addition, the otherwise predicted effect of \n\nthickness on magnetization is not observed in this case, since there is increase in magnetic \n\nresponse with increasing thickness. Both phenomena should have yielded increase in the \n\nuncompensated magnetic moments, due to higher degree of surface roughness and \n\nanisotropy. The explanation lies in the lack of thorough investigation of each sample, since \n\na more reliable technique for the thickness and porosity characterization should have been \n\nemployed. Nevertheless, the higher frequency of ferroelectric domains observed for the \n\nsamples D29 and P24 signifies enhanced ferroelectric behaviour and naturally higher \n\nmagnetoelectric coupling, in addition to the domain wall induced magnetization.[48,49] \n\nFurthermore, the random grain size distribution together with the larger grains observed in \n\nP60 can stimulate the formation of larger ferroelectric domains, thus smaller wall network. \n\n-60000 -30000 0 30000 60000\n\n-6.0x10\n-5\n\n-4.0x10\n-5\n\n-2.0x10\n-5\n\n0.0\n\n2.0x10\n-5\n\n4.0x10\n-5\n\n6.0x10\n-5\n\n \n\n \n\n  D150\n\n  P150\n\n?\n (\n\ne\nm\n\nu\n)\n\nH (Oe)\n \n\nFigure 4.17 Magnetic moment measurements under varying magnetic field at 300K for \n\nsamples P150 and D150. \n\nIn Figure 4.17, a comparison between a dense and a porous film is presented. For \n\nthe case of higher withdrawal velocity of 150 mm/min (Figure 4.17), porous sample P150 \n\nshows a higher remanent magnetization, as expected by the presence of surface anomaly \n\ninduced magnetization. The two thicknesses do not present large deviation, with 230 nm \n\nand 240 nm for P150 and D150 respectively, thus the uncompensated spins result mainly \n\nfrom the presence of porosity. \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion \n\n71 \n\n \n\n4.2.2 Studies of the Annealing Temperature \n\nThe loss of porosity order at elevated temperatures led to the need of a deeper \n\nunderstanding of grain growth and crystallization procedure, and how this affects the \n\nporosity network. The sample chosen for this study is P30 (with 29.58 mm/min withdrawal \n\nvelocity, 0.3 M sol-gel concentration and 30 mg solution template mass), since it presented \n\na relatively homogeneous porous structure. \n\nFigure 4.18 presents the SEM micrographs of P30 films for six different annealing \n\ntemperatures, ranging from 400 to 650 \no\nC with a dwell time of 5 min. The gradual loss of \n\nporous structure can be observed above 550 \no\nC, which corresponds to the beginning of the \n\ncrystallization process. \n\n400\no\nC 450\n\no\nC 500\n\no\nC \n\n   \n\n550\no\nC 600\n\no\nC 650\n\no\nC \n\n   \n\nFigure 4.18 SEM micrographs of BFO porous P30 for different annealing temperatures, \n\nranging from 400 to 650 \no\nC for 5 min. \n\nFigure 4.19, depicts the variation of the microstructure of sample P30 with the \n\nincrease of the annealing time for 450 and 500 \no\nC. At 450 \n\no\nC there is no significant change \n\nconcerning the porous order, as the annealing time increases. However, after 1 h of thermal \n\ntreatment, break of symmetry in grain interfaces due to the presence of porosity results in \n\nrandom densification of the films. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion \n\n72 \n\n \n\n 450 \no\nC 500 \n\no\nC \n\n5 min \n\n  \n\n10 min \n\n  \n\n20 min \n\n  \n\n30 min \n\n  \n\n1 h \n\n  \n\nFigure 4.19 SEM micrographs of BFO porous P30 films annealed at 450 and 500 \no\nC for \n\nincreasing annealing times. \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion \n\n73 \n\n \n\nThis effect becomes clear for the films annealed at 500 \no\nC, where the ordered array \n\ngives rise to large gaps of matter, creating a labyrinth-like porous motif. As the annealing \n\ntime increases the film densification takes place and the degree of porosity decreases, but \n\nthe ordering of porosity is almost lost. As 500 \no\nC is just before the transition temperature at \n\nwhich crystallization happens, as seen in Figure 4.19, higher annealing times present an \n\nextremely intense grain growth, thus these first steps of densification tend to diminish the \n\nsize of pores.  \n\nPFM studies conducted in these samples show the lack of piezoresponse signal \n\nconfirming the incipient degree of crystallinity of these films, since the crystallization \n\noccurs above 550 \no\nC. \n\n? Raman Spectroscopy Results \n\nRaman spectroscopy studies were carried out to compliment the investigation and \n\nidentification of the rhombohedral BiFeO3 phase present in the films.

In addition, peaks appearing at wavenumbers lower \n\nthan 200 cm\n-1\n\n result from Bi dislocations within the perovskite structure, whereas those \n\nwith wavenumber above 200 cm\n-1\n\n imply the tilting of the oxygen octahedra.[4,78] \n\nHowever, not all modes are always visible. Polarized Raman scattering studies by \n\nFukumura et al.[79] and Kothari et al.[80], for single-crystal and polycrystalline bulk BFO \n\nrespectively, revealed all 13 active modes, since phonon detection depends on polarization \n\norientation. In our case horizontal polarization with backscattering geometry was used.  \n\nPorous BFO P30 films annealed at 650 \no\nC present 6 of the phonon modes: A1-1, \n\nA1-2, A1-3, A1-4 and 4 E-symmetry modes (Figure 4.20 and Table 4.5). For 600 \no\nC \n\nannealing temperature only six active modes were detected. For 550 and 600 \no\nC annealing \n\ntemperatures the second E mode is present, whereas for 650 \no\nC it disappears. However, the \n\nlatter case shows the symmetry of A1-4. Raman spectrum for 550 \no\nC presents lower peak \n\ndefinition, possibly due to incipient crystallization. Although for the case of 600 \no\nC more \n\nmodes are present, the peak intensity is hindered, probably due to the appearance of other \n\nBFO symmetry phases.[37,81] \n\nTable 4.5 presents all the detected phonon modes for BFO porous P30 films \n\nannealed at three different temperatures, together with the respective modes and its \n\nfrequencies reported by Kothari et al.[80], Fukumura et al.[79], Singh et al.[77] and Yuan \n\net al.[82], for comparison. The first group\u2019s studies were conducted for bulk \n\npolycrystalline BFO prepared via solid state reaction technique. The second group studied \n\nbulk single crystal BFO and the last two groups epitaxial thin films. These discrepancies \n\nbetween the obtained results may be related to the different nature of the films and the \n\npresence of residual secondary phases. \n\n  \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion \n\n75 \n\n \n\nTable 4.5 Positions of the detected phonon modes (given in cm\n-1\n\n) and their symmetries for \n\nBFO porous P30 films annealed at different temperatures.

A uniform ferroelectric domain distribution is observed \n\nfor all images. \n\nIn order to ensure the genuine ferroelectric origin of the appearing domains, \n\ntopography and PFM image correlation is required.

The respective areas in the topography \n\nimage are also highlighted, revealing topography uniformity for the specific area. Thus, in \n\na highly homogeneous part of the film surface, ferroelectric domains with opposing \n\norientations can be observed, which is a strong evidence for the claiming ferroelectric \n\nbehaviour.

However the rest of the images were \n\ntaken with an 8\no\n rotation angle of the sample holder, relatively to the perpendicular \n\nposition required for the capture of cross-section image. The rotation was used in order to \n\nshow the peeling effect, which makes difficult the focus on the significantly thin film. The \n\ninclination only causes a small divergence in the real film thickness, since cos (8\no\n)?0.99, \n\nwhich corresponds to a much smaller error comparing to the irregularity in the film \n\nthickness.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion \n\n78 \n\n \n\nP5 P10 P29 \n\n   \n\nP45 P100 P150 \n\n   \n\nP180 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.22 Cross-section SEM images of BFO porous P5, P10, P29, P45, P100, P150 and \n\nP180 films, annealed at 600 \no\nC for 5 min.

The respective porosity \n\nsurface for the total volume for each sample was calculated. The pores were considered as \n\nspheres, with the respective diameter, as measured by the SEM micrographs presented in \n\nFigure 4.28. An approximation of the total surface area of the porous network was made \n\nby calculating the pore density of the surface and admitting that the same distribution takes \n\nplace for the entire film volume. As expected, increase of the total porosity surface is \n\nobserved for increasing thickness. The pore sizes and the surface pore density of the films \n\ndo not present large deviation. Larger volume due to higher thickness for P150 films \n\nresults in higher than the double of the porosity area of P5 films. \n\nTable 4.7 Antiferromangnetic susceptibility, remanent magnetization and the respective \n\nthicknesses and porosity surface for BFO porous P5, P29 and P150 films, annealed at 600 \no\nC. \n\nSample \n\nIdentification \n\nThickness \n\n(nm) \n\nPore \n\nSize \n\n(nm) \n\nPorosity \n\nSurface \n\nArea (cm\n2\n) \n\n?AF (10\n-10\n\n emu/Oe) ?r (10\n-5\n\n emu) \n\nP5 70 \u00b1 12 37 \u00b1 1.9 0.28 \u00b1 0.01 3.89 \u00b1 0.2\n \n\n3.44 \u00b1 1.5\n \n\nP29 170 \u00b1 9 38 \u00b1 3.5  0.52 \u00b1 0.008 4.27 \u00b10.2\n \n\n6.13 \u00b1 1.5\n \n\nP150 240 \u00b1 6 39 \u00b1 3.6 0.66 \u00b1 0.007 7.03 \u00b1 0.2\n \n\n17.3 \u00b1 1.5\n \n\n \n\nP5 P29 P150 \n\n   \n\nFigure 4.28 SEM micrographs of BFO porous P5, P29 and P150 films. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion \n\n84 \n\n \n\nAs shown in Figure 4.29, the magnetization curves reveal increase of \n\nmagnetization saturation for increasing thickness (Figure 4.30 (a)). This outcome is \n\nexplained by the increase of the porosity surface (Table 4.7 and Figure 4.30(b)), induced \n\nbe the increased porous network for the cases of thicker films. Since no normalization by \n\nmass of film was made, in a sense that a more relative value of magnetization would have \n\nbeen measured if such a subtraction had been made, thicker films presented higher absolute \n\nmagnetization than the thinner ones. BFO porous P150 films with a thickness of 240 nm \n\npresent a porous network of 1.99 cm\n2\n total area, which is 330992 times larger than the \n\nsurface area of a dense sample with the same dimensions and as discussed in Section 4.2.1 \n\nit presents higher magnetic response. \n\n-60000 -30000 0 30000 60000\n-6.0x10\n\n-5\n\n-3.0x10\n-5\n\n0.0\n\n3.0x10\n-5\n\n6.0x10\n-5\n\n \n\n \n\nP150\n\nP29\n\nP5\n\n?\n?(\n\ne\nm\n\nu\n)\n\nH(Oe)  \n\nFigure 4.29 Magnetic moment measurements under varying magnetic field at 300K for \n\nporous samples with increasing thickness P5, P29 and P150, annealed at 600\no\nC. \n\n100 150 200 250\n0.00000\n\n0.00005\n\n0.00010\n\n0.00015\n\n0.00020\n\n \n\n \n\n?\nr \n\n(e\nm\n\nu\n)\n\nThickness (nm)\n\n0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7\n0.00000\n\n0.00005\n\n0.00010\n\n0.00015\n\n0.00020\n\n \n\n \n\n?\nr \n\n(e\nm\n\nu\n)\n\nPorosity Surface Area (cm2)\n \n\nFigure 4.30 Remanent magnetization as a function of (a) thickness and (b) porosity surface \n\nfor porous samples with increasing thickness P5, P29 and P150. \n\n(a) (b) \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion \n\n85 \n\n \n\nSummarising for the thickness and porosity study of the porous films, increase in \n\nthe withdrawal velocity led to increase in the film thickness.

By the application of an \n\nexternal electric field, magnetoelectric coupling takes place, mainly at the interface of the \n\ntwo phases, which makes possible the emergence of magnetic domains.[32,74] \n\nIn order to explore whether electric field-induced magnetization could occur, MFM \n\nstudies were carried out for BFO D180 and P24 films annealed at 600 \no\nC, with \n\nsimultaneous application of dc voltage of 4 V. As mentioned in Section 2.7.3, a \n\ncombination of tapping and non-contact mode is required for such measurements. The \n\ntopography image is first taken by tapping mode, which is a hybrid type of topography \n\nimaging, a combination between contact and non-contact mode. The cantilever-tip vibrates \n\nat the resonance frequency and the amplitude is maintained constant during surface-tip \n\ninteraction, causing vertical variations and making possible the surface monitoring. \n\nHowever, for the magnetic force detection the tip is elevated at sufficient distance from the \n\nsurface (non-contact lifting mode operation), depending on the roughness of the sample. \n\nFor the current study, non-contact measurements took place at 200 nm.  \n\nIn Figure 4.37, the topography and MFM images are shown for a dense sample \n\ndeposited at 180mm/min (D180) and a porous sample with 24 mg of solution template \n\nmass and 29.58 mm/min withdrawal velocity (P24). The last image is a tapping mode \n\ntopography image of sample P24, without the use of magnetic detection mode. The tip \n\nelevation, required for the latter measurement, in most cases results in large drifts in the \n\ntopography image, as can be observed in the second topography image. It was chosen in \n\norder to show the high resolution of tapping mode for surface imaging, comparing to the \n\ncontact mode of PFM technique. \n\nIn the MFM images domains with opposing orientation were detected. The 200 nm \n\ntip distance of the surface excludes the case of topography artefacts. However, most \n\nprobably the domains\u2019 nature is ferroelectric, since the conductive tip can sense the \n\nattractive electrostatic forces from the electric field induced surface charges. In addition, \n\nthe domain geometry is very similar to the ones obtained by PFM characterization. In order \n\n\n\n  CHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion \n\n91 \n\n \n\nto ensure the origin of the identified response in the MFM images, a tapping mode \n\ncantilever-tip without the magnetic coating was subsequently used. The results showed \n\nresembling domain configuration, however are not presented here, as scanning of the same \n\narea is extremely difficult to be achieved when changing the tip. Last but not least, a \n\npossible magnetoelectric coupling, presumably occurring at the domain walls and grain \n\nboundaries, resulted in domains slightly larger than the ferroelectric ones. \n\n Topography Image MFM Image \n\nD180 \n\n  \n\nP24 \n\n  \n\nP24 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.37 Topography and MFM images for samples D180 and P24.

Conclusions and Future Work \n\nA series of BFO dense films with varying withdrawal velocities were produced, \n\nserving as means of comparison for the porous thin films. For low withdrawal velocities \n\nthe films presented porosity features, yet by increasing velocity dense structure was \n\nobtained. Increasing withdrawal velocity resulted in increasing film thickness. Phase \n\nimpurities were detected for the dense films D5 with the lowest film thickness. \n\nPiezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) characterization was conducted, revealing the \n\nexpected ferroelectric domains. By the same technique, local piezoelectric hysteresis loops \n\nwere obtained, showing increase of polarization saturation with increasing film thickness. \n\nLastly, magnetic moment measurements were carried out by the use of Superconducting \n\nQuantum Interference Device (SQUID), presenting decrease of remanent magnetization \n\nwith increasing thickness. A schematic representation in Figure 5.1 summarises the above \n\nresults. \n\nNevertheless, further studies for the obtainment of higher film densification should \n\nbe made, so that a more correct comparison with the porous case could be carried out. \n\nFinally, after conferring a dense structure, macroscopic measurements of the piezoelectric \n\nhysteresis loop should be done, in order to be compared with the local ones. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 Conclusions and Future Work \n\n96 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1 Schematic representation of the results obtained in this work for the sol-gel \n\nprepared BFO dense films.

By varying the template concentration, the size and ordering of porosity was \n\ntailored. Homogeneity and lack of cracks in the films were successfully achieved, by \n\ndecreasing solution template mass, for a given solution concentration. Thermal treatment \n\nstudies revealed loss of porous network ordering at elevated annealing temperatures, \n\nrequired for the obtainment of crystallization and enhanced multiferroic properties. BFO \n\nporous films with low film thickness presented the formation of impurities. Increasing dip-\n\ncoating withdrawal velocity led to the production of films with increasing thicknesses. \n\nLocal piezoelectric hysteresis loops showed increase of the effective piezoelectric \n\ncoefficient with increasing thickness. SQUID characterization presented increasing \n\nremanent magnetization with increasing porosity. \n\nThe most important future study for the porous matrices is that of the \n\nmicrostructure regulation at elevated annealing temperatures. This could be faced by better \n\ncontrol of the correlation of the quantities of the inorganic precursors and the template in \n\nthe solution, as well as by the use of different solvents. In addition, a series of annealing \n\nprofiles should be studied, such as nitrogen atmosphere and slower and longer thermal \n\ntreatment processes. \n\nAt last but not least, the functionalization of the porous matrices by the introduction \n\nof preferably a ferromagnetic material, could lead to enhanced multiferroic properties and \n\ngigantic magnetoelectric coupling.
