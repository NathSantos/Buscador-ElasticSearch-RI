Orientador: Jorge Luiz Colodette.  \n\n \n\nEsse trabalho est\u00e1 apresentado em duas partes distintas, sendo a primeira focalizada na \n\nqualidade da madeira de eucalipto cultivada sob diferentes regimes de ferti-irriga\u00e7\u00e3o para \n\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de celulose (Cap\u00edtulo 1) e a segunda na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o preliminar da qualidade da \n\nmadeira de eucalipto e de outras mat\u00e9rias-primas, tais como baga\u00e7o da cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar, \n\nsabugo de milho e licor de eucalipto do processo pr\u00e9-hidr\u00f3lise Kraft de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de polpa \n\nsol\u00favel, para a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de furfural (Cap\u00edtulo 2).  O grande interesse em madeira de eucalipto \n\nvem de seu baixo custo de produ\u00e7\u00e3o em regi\u00f5es tropicais, principalmente devido \u00e0 alta \n\nprodutividade florestal. O melhoramento gen\u00e9tico associado ao adequado manejo florestal \n\n(fertiliza\u00e7\u00e3o, irriga\u00e7\u00e3o) se destaca como ferramenta importante na produ\u00e7\u00e3o de madeira de \n\nalta qualidade e de baixo custo. O objetivo do Cap\u00edtulo 1 foi avaliar o efeito do regime de \n\nferti-irriga\u00e7\u00e3o na composi\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica e massa espec\u00edfica b\u00e1sica da madeira de clones do \n\nEucalyptus spp. e suas poss\u00edveis consequ\u00eancias na produ\u00e7\u00e3o de polpa celul\u00f3sica. Quatro \n\nclones foram avaliados, sendo dois da esp\u00e9cie Eucalyptus grandis e os outros dois \n\nprovenientes dos h\u00edbridos de Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus urophylla, com a idade de 72 \n\nmeses. Os tratamentos avaliados foram 2 n\u00edveis de aduba\u00e7\u00e3o, o Tradicional n\u00e3o irrigado \n\n(T/NI) e o Ferti-irrigado (F/I), al\u00e9m do tratamento Controle (C/NI), onde n\u00e3o foi utilizado \n\nnenhum tipo de adubo ou irriga\u00e7\u00e3o, tendo cada tratamento 3 repeti\u00e7\u00f5es, totalizando 36 \n\namostras. Os resultados indicaram diferen\u00e7a estat\u00edstica significativa para massa espec\u00edfica \n\nb\u00e1sica, teor de mangan\u00eas, rela\u00e7\u00e3o siringila/guaiacila da lignina e teor de grupos acetila das \n\nmadeiras, e similaridade para teor de carboidratos, lignina total, \u00e1cidos ur\u00f4nicos, extrativos, \n\ncinzas, Fe, Ca e Mg. Conclui-se que a t\u00e9cnica de ferti-irriga\u00e7\u00e3o, apresentou alguns aspectos \n\nnegativos no que tange \u00e0 qualidade da madeira de certos clones de eucalipto, sendo relevante \n\nconsiderar os seus impactos no processo produtivo de fabrica\u00e7\u00e3o de polpa celul\u00f3sica.

Por exemplo, derivados de furano, tais como o 5-hidroximetilfurfural (HMF) \n\ne furfural origin\u00e1rios de biomassa, t\u00eam potencial para substituir derivados do petr\u00f3leo na \n\nfabrica\u00e7\u00e3o de qu\u00edmicos finos e de pl\u00e1sticos.  Foi estudado o efeito de diferentes concentra\u00e7\u00f5es \n\n\n\nvi \n\n \n\n(1,5-5,2 mol.L-1) dos \u00e1cidos minerais, \u00e1cido clor\u00eddrico (HCl), \u00e1cido sulf\u00farico (H2SO4) e \u00e1cido \n\nfosf\u00f3rico (H3PO4) na produ\u00e7\u00e3o de furfural por hidrodestila\u00e7\u00e3o do sabugo de milho, baga\u00e7o da \n\ncana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar e madeira de eucalipto.

Assessment \nof lignocellulosic materials quality and furfural production from corn cobs, sugarcane \n\nbagasse, eucalyptus wood and dissolving pulp pre-hydrolyzate. Adviser: Jorge Luiz \n\nColodette. \n\n \n\nThis work is presented in two distinct parts, the first focused on the quality of \n\neucalyptus wood grown for pulp production under different ferti-irrigation systems (Chapter \n\n1) and the second on the preliminary assessment of the quality of eucalyptus wood and other \n\nmaterials for the production of furfural such as sugarcane bagasse, corn cobs and pre-\n\nhydrolyzed eucalyptus from the pre-hydrolysis Kraft process for dissolving pulp production \n\n(Chapter 2). The great interest in eucalyptus wood comes from its low cost of production in \n\nsome regions, mainly due to high forest productivity. Genetic improvements associated with \n\nappropriate forest management (fertilization, irrigation, etc.) stand out as important tools in \n\nthe production of wood of high quality and low cost. The goal of Chapter 1 was to evaluate \n\nthe effect of the ferti-irrigation regime on the chemical composition and specific basic mass of \n\nwood from clones of the Eucalyptus spp. and possible consequences on the production of \n\ncellulose pulp. Four clones were evaluated, two being from the species Eucalyptus grandis \n\nand the other two coming from hybrids of Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus urophylla, with \n\nage of 72 months. The treatments were evaluated with two levels of fertilization, the \n\nTraditional no irrigated (T/NI) and Ferti-irrigation (F/I), and a treatment Control no irrigated \n\n(C/NI), which was to not use any fertilizer or irrigation, with each treatment having three \n\nreplicates, totaling 36 samples. The results indicated statistically significant differences for \n\nspecific basic mass , manganese, lignin syringyl/guaiacyl ratio and acetyl group content of the \n\nwoods, and similarity in carbohydrate, total lignin, uronic acids, extractives, ash, Fe, Ca and \n\nMg. We conclude that the technique of ferti-irrigation presented some negative aspects \n\nregarding the quality of the wood of certain eucalyptus clones, it being relevant to consider \n\ntheir impacts on the production process for manufacturing cellulose pulp. In Chapter 2, \n\nconsidering the biorefinery concept it is possible to integrate the processes of pulp production \n\nto those of materials, chemicals and fuels from lignocellulosic biomass.  For example, furan \n\nderivatives, such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and furfural originating from biomass \n\nhave the potential to replace petroleum in the manufacture of fine chemicals and plastics. The \n\neffect was studied of different concentrations (1.5 to 5.2 mol.L-1) of mineral acids, \n\nhydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and phosphoric acid (H3PO4) on the \n\n\n\nviii \n\n \n\nproduction of furfural by hydro distillation of corn cob, sugarcane bagasse and eucalyptus \n\nwood. The liquor from the pre-hydrolysis Kraft process for dissolving pulp production was \n\nalso assessed for furfural production, using sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid as catalysts. \n\nThe results showed that the production of furfural was strongly influenced by the \n\nconcentration and type of mineral acid and the raw material. The highest productivity of \n\nfurfural, based on the dry weight biomass were 30.2% for corn cobs and 25.8% for the \n\nsugarcane bagasse, both using HCl 5.2 mol.L-1, for eucalyptus wood, the yield was 13.9% \n\nusing 3.9 mol.L-1 HCl. The yield of conversion of pentose to furfural using the eucalyptus pre-\n\nhydrolysis liquor was 71.5% using HCl 3.9 mol.L-1. It was concluded that using mineral acids \n\nas catalysts for hydro distillation is suitable for the production of furfural from lignocellulosic \n\nwastes originating from industrial processes. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n1 \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nThe world economy is currently undergoing major changes that have been \n\nincreasingly influenced by climate change that the planet is passing through. The current need \n\nto seek renewable and alternative energy has led to the development of various technologies. \n\nProcessing industries correspond to the main targets of these technologies, which in addition \n\nto seeking cleaner energy sources, have also invested efforts in search of the better use of \n\nnatural resources, increasing process efficiency while reducing pressure on planted areas. \n\nStudies to correlate the use of a cleaner energy matrix and the increase in the use efficiency of \n\nnatural resources have yet to relate these two factors to the quality assurance of the final \n\nproduct, which makes this new vision of development included in the production sectors even \n\nmore challenging. \n\nIn virtue of adequate climate, large areas available for cultivation technologies for \n\nadvanced agricultural and forest production and an excellent adaptation of certain crops under \n\nthe tropical climate, the costs of biomass in Brazil are quite low compared with other parts of \n\nthe world. Various clones of the genus Eucalyptus are continuously improved and cultivated \n\nin order to provide the most suitable raw material for production, according to the evaluation \n\ncriteria of quality wood. \n\nThe wood quality is the factor that determines its market value and its applications in \n\nvarious industrial segments. For the cellulose and paper sector, wood quality has been \n\ndescribed primarily through its physical properties such as specific basic mass and chemical \n\ncomposition. Thus, there is a need to study how these factors are affected throughout the \n\ngrowth of the tree. In general, it is found that the properties of wood are dependent on \n\ngenetics, growth conditions and the age of the tree. Fertilization techniques can be used \n\nduring tree growth to improve its development, but the effect of fertilization on the chemical \n\ncomposition of the wood has not yet been fully elucidated. \n\nChapter 1 discusses the effects of ferti-irrigation on the chemical composition of the \n\nwood and its specific basic mass in clones of the genus Eucalyptus spp., assessing its possible \n\nconsequences on cellulose production. The evaluation of these factors helps in understanding \n\nthe properties required for cellulose production and biomaterials production, its constitution \n\nbeing relevant for determining its final destination. \n\nLignocellulosic biomass is a renewable and available resource, which needs to be \n\nfurther explored, and the manufacture of products with high added value from biomass, is an \n\nimportant option to be pursued. Decreased dependence on fossil fuel reserves, through the \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\nintensive use of renewable materials, boosts rural development, and heads towards a modern \n\nsustainable society. \n\nThe possibility of cellulose production process integration with those of biomaterials \n\ncame about from the concept of biorefineries. This new line of worldwide research seeks \n\nmore rational use of fibrous materials, favoring the extraction of the various components of \n\nnatural resources, minimizing waste generation and contemplating the use of the \n\nmultiproducts generated. \n\nThe use of eucalyptus in the cellulose and paper industry is well established. However, \n\nthe possibility of using grasses to add value to that industry, using the new biorefinery \n\nconcept, has been widely studied. Fibrous materials such as bagasse and straw (composed of \n\nthe sugarcane leaf and apical portion of the stem) of sugarcane, bamboo and corn cobs have \n\ngood hemicellulose values in their constitution. These residues materials, being available from \n\nagricultural biomass and forestry processing, constitute a potential source for the production \n\nof chemicals such as ethanol, sugars and furfural, using enzymes or by acid-catalyzed \n\nhydrolysis.   \n\nThe interest in the production of chemicals from renewable resources has increased in \n\nthe last decade in direct relation to the declining reserves and rising prices of fossil fuels. The \n\nuse of renewable raw materials, biomass in particular, is a good option as a new economic and \n\nenvironmental alternative. In this regard, furan derivatives, such as furfural and 5-\n\nhydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) can be produced from the acid catalyzed dehydration of \n\npentoses and hexoses, respectively, contained in lignocellulosic biomass (such as corn cobs \n\nand cotton). These compounds have the potential to be sustainable substitutes for \n\npetrochemicals used in the production of fine chemicals and plastics. \n\n Chapter 2 addresses the use of different mineral acids for the conversion of pentose, \n\nfrom lignocellulosic materials, into furfural. Among the lignocellulosic materials used, there \n\nis the corn cob, sugarcane bagasse and eucalypt wood, which are wastes from agroindustrial \n\nprocesses, besides trying to produce furfural from the eucalyptus liquor from pre-hydrolysis \n\nKraft dissolving pulp production, which is rich in pentoses. \n\nThis study aimed to: assess the quality of Eucalyptus spp. under the influence of ferti-\n\nirrigation treatments to produce cellulose, in addition to a review of the effect of hydrochloric, \n\nsulfuric and phosphoric acid as a catalyst for the production of furfural associated with \n\ndifferent lignocellulosic raw materials. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\nQUALITY OF EUCALYPTUS SPP.WOOD CULTIVATED UNDER DIFFERENT \n\nFERTI-IRRIGATION SCHEMES FOR CELLULOSE PRODUCTION \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\n This current paper has the objective of evaluating the effect of two levels of \n\nfertilization (NPK) on the chemical composition and on the specific basic mass of the wood of \n\nclones from the Eucalyptus spp., assessing its possible consequences in the production of \n\ncellulosic pulp. Four clones were evaluated, two of those being of the Eucalyptus grandis \n\nspecies and the other two proceeding from hybrids of Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus \n\nurophylla, at the age of 72 months. The treatments were evaluated with two levels of \n\nfertilization, the Traditional no irrigated (T/NI) and Ferti-irrigation (F/I), and a treatment \n\nControl no irrigated (C/NI), which was to not use any fertilizer or irrigation, with each \n\ntreatment having three replicates, totaling 36 samples. The analyzed chemical features were \n\nassociated with the level of fertilization and the type of genetic material at stake. For the \n\nstatistical analysis one used the STATISTICA 7.0 software, where one made the analysis of \n\nvariation and, in the case of significant interaction, there was decomposition through the \n\nTukey test, at the level of 5% probability. There was significant difference for the following \n\nproperties: specific basic mass, manganese, lignin syringyl/guaiacyl ratio (S/G) and acetyl \n\ngroup content. For the remaining analyzed properties such as carbohydrate content, total \n\nlignin, uronic acids, extractives, ashes, Fe, Ca and Mg, no statistical difference was noticed. \n\nWe conclude that the technique of ferti-irrigation presented some negative aspects regarding \n\nthe quality of the wood of certain eucalyptus clones, it being relevant to consider their impacts \n\non the production process for manufacturing cellulose pulp.  \n\nKeywords: fertilization, chemistry of wood, eucalyptus and specific basic mass. \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nThe genus Eucalyptus has, as representatives, the most commonly grown species in \n\nthe world, with over 4.75 million hectares in Brazil (Bracelpa, 2013). It is widely employed to \n\nproduce wood for various purposes, due to its rapid growth, good ecological adaptation and \n\nhigh versatility. Eucalyptus grandis, along with others such as Eucalyptus urophylla, is one of \n\nthe most studied species. These species generally have satisfactory characteristics to be \n\nemployed for various purposes, particularly for the cellulose and paper industries, hardboard \n\nand energy use, according to the quality of the wood (Berger, 2002). \n\nFor the cellulose and paper sector, wood quality has been described primarily through \n\nits physical, chemical and anatomical parameters which are considered as good evaluation \n\nparameters of its characteristics and of great use in forestry breeding programs. Thus, there is \n\na need to study how these factors are affected throughout the growth of the tree. In general, it \n\nappears that the wood properties depend on genetics, growth conditions and the age of the tree \n\n(Mellerowicz and Sundberg, 2008; Cooke et al., 2005). Ferti-irrigation techniques may be \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nused during tree growth to improve its development, because the formation of wood is highly \n\nsensitive to environmental changes. \n\nThe natural soil characteristics, as well as fertilizer and moisture content, are factors \n\nthat can influence the wood quality. Changes in growth conditions, due to the application of \n\nfertilizers and the use of irrigation techniques, are often associated with significant changes in \n\nthe quality of the wood. This importance refers to the physical, chemical and anatomical \n\nattributes (Pitre et al., 2010). However, the effects of ferti-irrigation are difficult to predict; \n\nsome studies indicate an increase, others, to the contrary, show a decline in wood quality \n\n(Barreiros et al., 2007; Punches and Country, 2004). \n\nThe recommendations for mineral fertilizers used always refer to the elements \n\nNitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium, but very rarely to Boron and Zinc, which are \n\nrecommended for application at planting or as top dressing applied 90 days after planting \n\n(Barros, 2012). Currently, most commercial plantations are fertilized using virtually the same \n\nN-P-K (6-30-6), regardless of species, soil type and planting time. \n\nNitrogen fertilization is one of the practices that has been most employed to achieve \n\nincreased productivity (Macdonald and Hubert, 2002). Nitrogen is often a limiting factor for \n\nthe growth of terrestrial plants, therefore, the addition of nitrogen-rich fertilizers can have \n\nprofound effects on the physiology of the tree and biomass accumulation (Cooke et al., 2005; \n\nGessler et al., 2004.) Changes at the anatomical and compositional levels have often been \n\ndescribed in relation to N-P-K fertilization, water stress and mechanical stimuli. However, the \n\neffects of fertilization on wood quality are difficult to predict. \n\nFor the cellulose and paper industry, a proper assessment of specific basic mass  \n\nprovides very precise indications about the chip impregnation and process yield and is usually \n\nassociated with quality traits and pulp physical-mechanical resistance. There are few studies \n\nthat directly relate the interference of soil attributes on the quality of forest species (Rigatto et \n\nal., 2005). In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of ferti-irrigation on the \n\nchemical composition and specific basic mass of Eucalyptus spp. \n\n \n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS \n\nThis study evaluated two fertilization levels, the Traditional no irrigated (T/NI) and \n\nFerti-irrigation (F/I), besides the Control (C/NI) treatment, in which fertilization or irrigation \n\nwas not used. Fertilizer applications were made by topdressing applied in three doses per year \n\nfor the first three years. Irrigation was tested only for the F/I treatment in which irrigation was \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nconducted, in order to maintain an average soil humidity around 15-30 mm. This procedure \n\nwas performed twice every seven days, in order to maintain moisture from precipitation and \n\ncompensate for evapotranspiration. \n\nTable 1 shows the types of treatments and their respective amounts of chemicals per \n\nhectare. The C/NI treatment was not added in the table, since there was no fertilization and \n\nirrigation. \n\n \n\nTable 1. Nutritional conditions in kg/ha, used for the treatments, where fertilization took \n\nplace.                                       \n\nTreatments \nFertilization \n\nNitrogen Phosphorus Potassium Calcium Magnesium Boron \n\nT/NI 86 40 171 705 120 3 \n\nF/I 732 145 570 918 180 8 \n\n*T/NI - Traditional no irrigated; F/I \u2013 Ferti-irrigation. \n\nThe eucalyptus species used were: Eucalyptus grandis (Clones A and B) and hybrids \n\nof Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus urophylla (Clones A and B), originating from the city of \n\nGuanh\u00e3es in the state of Minas Gerais. The trees used were 72 months old and were taken \n\nfrom the same 30 x 30 m planting parcel, with row spacing of 3.0 x 3.0 m cultivated in a \n\nOxisol. We sampled three trees for each clone, considering each fertilization level and C/NI \n\ntreatment, totaling 36 samples. \n\nThe wood samples for chemical analyzes were collected after their reduction into \n\nsawdust in a Wiley laboratory mill, and subsequently classified into sieves of 40 and 60 mesh. \n\nThe samples were air conditioned and packed in airtight containers and their moisture content \n\ndetermined. All chemical analyzes were performed in duplicate. \n\nAfter preparation of the samples, the following analyzes were performed: \n\ncarbohydrate content (Wallis et al., 1996), uronic acids (Scott, 1979), acetyl groups (Solar et \n\nal., 1987), acid-insoluble lignin TAPPI T222 om-11 (Tappi, 2011a), acid-soluble lignin \n\n(Goldschimid, 1971), total lignin (insoluble lignin + acid-soluble lignin), lignin \n\nsyringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio (Lin and Dence, 1992), ash content TAPPI T211 om-12 (Tappi, \n\n2012), wood extractives TAPPI T264 cm-07 (Tappi, 2007), specific basic mass of the wood \n\nTAPPI T258 om-11 (Tappi, 2011b) and metal content - Ca, Mg, Mn and Fe TAPPI T266 om-\n\n11 (Tappi, 2011c). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nExperimental design \n\nThe experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design in a 3 x 4 factorial \n\noutline; three fertilization levels (C/NI, T/I and F/I) and four clones, 2 of Eucalyptus grandis \n\nand two hybrids of Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus urophylla with 3 replications, totaling 12 \n\ntreatments and 36 samples. \n\n   The results were analyzed by analysis of variance, upon noting the presence of \n\nsignificant interaction, the results were compared by the Tukey test at 5% level of \n\nsignificance. Statistical analyzes were performed using STATISTICA 7.0 software and the 3D \n\ngraphs elaborated in the software MATLAB R2011b. \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nThe effect of fertilization on the four clones studied at 72 months of age was evaluated \n\nbased on the specific basic mass and chemical composition of wood (glucans, xylans, \n\ngalactans, mannans, arabinans, acetyl groups, uronic acids, total lignin, syringyl/guaiacyl \n\n(S/G) ratio, ash, extractives, and Ca, Mg, Fe and Mn). The average of all analyzes of the \n\nchemical composition for both clones: Eucalyptus grandis (Clones A and B) and hybrids of \n\nEucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus urophylla (Clones A and B) are shown in Table 2.

Among the clones tested, clone A of Eucalyptus grandis showed \n\nthe highest levels of acetyl groups in relation to the others. The results of acetyl groups are \n\nslightly below the reference range in the literature of 2.5 to 4% (Mokfienski et al., 2004), \n\nhowever, in the work done by Gomide et al. (2005) results were obtained that are consistent \n\nwith the data presented in the present study, with mean values ranging from 2.6% to 3.1%.  \n\n \n\nLignin \n\nLignin, the second largest wood quantitative constituent, had its content determined by \n\nsumming the values of the acid soluble and insoluble fractions. There were no significant \n\ndifferences among treatments for total lignin content (Table 2). The results of this study are \n\nconsistent with Miranda and Pereira (2002), Jian Ju et al. (1998), and Andrade et al. (1994) \n\nwho studied the effect of fertilizer on Eucalyptus spp. observed no influence on the total \n\nlignin content.  \n\n \n\nS/G Ratio \n\nFrom a structural standpoint, lignins can be divided into two main classes, namely: \n\nguaiacyl lignin (predominant in softwoods) and syringyl/guaiacyl lignin (prevalent in \n\nhardwoods).  \n\nThe S/G ratio is the amount of units derived from sinapyl alcohol (syringyl monomers) \n\nin reference to the content of coniferyl alcohol (guaiacyl monomers) of the lignin (Sixta, \n\n2006). The syringyl lignin structure is more reactive, so it is believed that wood with a high \n\nS/G ratio are easier to delignify. \n\nIn this work, there was a statistically significant differences among clones for the \n\nlignin S/G ratio (Table 2), indicating no influence of the genetic material. In the work of \n\nMagaton et al. (2006) a mean value of 2.0 for the S/G ratio in Eucalyptus grandis x \n\nEucalyptus urophylla was found. The Eucalyptus grandis clone B showed the lowest S/G \n\nvalues, which is unfavorable for the process of wood conversion into cellulose, because it \n\nhinders the wood delignification process, since the lignin is more condensed (Gomes, 2008). \n\n The ferti-irrigation had no effect on the treatments for the lignin S/G ratio from a \n\nstatistical point of view. However, numerically, the Ferti-irrigation treatment showed higher \n\nvalues than the Control non-irrigated treatment. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nAsh \n\nThe principal mineral components of wood are Ca, K and Mg, Ca being the element in \n\nlarger amounts, representing up to 50%, followed by K, Mg, Mn, N and P, respectively, \n\namong others (Cutter and Murphy, 1978). \n\nSome forest species have, as reserve material, oxalate, phosphate and silicate crystals, \n\nand others, in their makeup, forming bonds with the carboxylic acids of the chemical \n\ncomponents of the cell wall. These crystals are often present in parenchyma cells occupying \n\nthe lumen as reserve material (Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, 1993). The shape and the amount of these crystals \n\nwill depend on genetic and environmental factors.  \n\nIn Eucalyptus species, these crystalline formations are rare, however, in these forest \n\nspecies oxalates formations, especially calcium, may be a result of various factors, including \n\nmineral deficiency. In soils with high acidity, high rainfall, low amount of available nutrients \n\nand cation leaching, the plant resorts to storing this mineral, in order to maintain its normal \n\ndevelopment during seasonal growth periods (Gonzales et al., 2009; Cumming et al. 2001). \n\nFor species assessed in this study, the ash content was not significantly different for all \n\ntreatments (Table 2). The ash contents were found in the range of 0.1 to 1.0% based on dry \n\nwood, these values being in agreement with those found by other authors, such as Oliveira et \n\nal. (2012), Neves et al. (2011). \n\n \n\nExtractives  \n\nThe wood extractives, that comprise a large number of components, which, unlike \n\nmost of the lignin and polysaccharides, can be extracted by means of organic solvents, \n\nshowed statistically significant for all clones (Table 2). The results indicate that there is \n\nsignificant influence of the genetic material, but there was no effect of ferti-irrigation on the \n\ncontent of extractives for the clones, as in Miranda and Pereira (2002), who also observed in \n\ntheir studies no effect of fertilization on the content of extractives. \n\n \n\nMetal Content \n\nThe highest amount of minerals was found in the bark, which may amount to more \n\nthan 10 times the amount present in the wood. Among the minerals occurring in greater \n\nquantities we can cite calcium, potassium and magnesium, followed respectively by Mn, Na, \n\nCl and P (Andrade, 2011). \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\nRegarding the metal content for the four clones in this study, Ca, Mg, and Fe content \n\nshowed no statistical difference. Only for the element Mn were statistical differences \n\nobserved between the clones, a fact that shows the influence of the genetic material, as shown \n\nin Table 3. There was a trend of increasing Mn content in the Ferti-irrigation treatments \n\ncompared to the non-irrigated control. This is an undesirable result because transition metals \n\ncan cause encrustation, besides catalyzing the decomposition of peroxides during the cellulose \n\nproduction process. The decomposition of peroxide leads to the production of free radicals \n\nsuch as hydroxyl and hydroperoxide that degrade the carbohydrate chains, lowering the \n\nviscosity of the cellulose (Colodette et al., 1993; Thakore et al., 2005). \n\n \n\nInteraction of metal contents versus specific basic mass \n\nGenerally woods of Eucalyptus species have low metal content, but if we analyze the \n\nwood of younger individuals aged close to two years, we will see that there is a higher metal \n\ncontent, this fact can be related to a more accelerated plant growth due to a greater absorption \n\nof nutrients from the soil, caused by higher cell metabolism during this development phase. \n\nAssociated with nutrient availability, irrigation influences the mobility of nutrients in the soil, \n\nfavoring their absorption by the plant. \n\nTrees older than two years may also exhibit greater amount of mineral elements in the \n\nwood constitution, this fact can be related to fertilization techniques, for example, the use of \n\nintensive soil fertilization associated to irrigation, which may result in faster growth and a \n\npossible reduction in its specific basic mass . \n\nAmong the minerals absorbed by most plants we can cite manganese, magnesium, iron \n\nand calcium. \n\nThe main form of manganese absorption by plants is as Mn2+, being absorbed by the \n\nroots and translocated through the xylem, along with other mineral elements dissolved in the \n\nsap. In tropical acid soils its availability is higher, and this characteristic decreases with \n\nincreasing pH of the soil (Bertolazi et al., 2010).   \n\nFigure 1 shows the relationship between specific basic mass and concentration of \n\nmanganese (Mn) and magnesium (Mg), where the clones for C/NI treatment, which are \n\ndevoid of fertilization and irrigation, are represented. \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1. Graph of the relation between the values of specific mass (kg/m3), manganese \n\nconcentration (mg/kg) and magnesium (mg/kg) in the wood of two tested species, for the \n\nC/NI treatment. \n \n\nIn Figure 1, we see that as the specific basic mass  of the clone in the C/NI treatments \n\nincreases, we note  the Mn increases and the Mg decreases. This fact may be related to a \n\npossible competition between the elements Mn and Mg, the first of which inhibits the \n\nabsorption of certain nutrients by plants, including the Mg (Correia and Durigan, 2009; \n\nMukhopadhyay and Sharma, 1991). \n\nFigure 2 graphically shows the values for the relationship between the specific basic \n\nmass and concentration of manganese (Mn) and magnesium (Mg) in the wood of ther 4 clones \n\nof the F/I treatment.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Graph of the relation between specific mass values (kg/m3), manganese \n\nconcentration (mg/kg) and  magnesium (mg/kg)  in the wood of two tested species, for the F/I \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nIn Figure 2 it can be seen that there was a decrease in the specific basic mass of the \n\nelement associated with an increase of Mn and a decrease of Mg. The trees with more growth \n\ntend to have a lower specific basic mass  associated to greater absorption of nutrients.  Mn, as \n\nit is an element with lower mobility in the plant, tends to be absorbed in higher quantities and \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\naccumulate in certain parts of the wood, consequently also causing a reduction in the \n\nabsorption of magnesium, since they compete (Bertolazi et al., 2010; Correia and Durigan, \n\n2009; Mukhopadhyay and Sharma, 1991). According Bertolazi et al. (2010) one of the ways \n\nto increase the availability of manganese in the soil is associated with fertilizer application. \n\nFigure 3 graphically presents the values for the relationship between the specific basic \n\nmass and the concentration of iron (Fe) and calcium (Ca) in the wood of the 4 clones of the \n\nC/NI treatment. \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Graph of the relation between the specific mass (kg/m3), concentration of Fe \n\n(mg/kg) and Ca (mg/kg) in the wood of two tested species, for the C/NI treatment. \n\n \n\nAnalyzing Figure 3, it can be seen that there was an increase in specific basic mass  \n\naccompanied by an increase in the amount of iron, and a reduction of the amount of calcium, \n\nconsidering the values for the two species. \n\nThe soils of origin of the species studied was the oxisol, which has a low pH, \n\ncombined with a high amount of aluminum, which increases its toxicity to plants. Calcium \n\nabsorption by trees in soils with low nutrient availability, in addition to low pH, favors its \n\nstorage by the plant, as a reserve nutrient, so that it can complete its development during \n\ninhospitable times (Gonzales et al., 2009) . \n\nOne possible explanation for the high iron content is in the content of manganese. \n\nWoods with high density, present lower amounts of manganese in relation to the low specific \n\nbasic mass , the Mn being a competitor of the Fe \n\nIn Figure 4 graphically showns the values for the relationship between the density and \n\nthe concentration of iron (Fe) and calcium (Ca) in the wood of the 4 clones of the F/I \n\ntreatment.  \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4. Graph of the relation between specific mass values (kg/m3), concentration of Fe \n\n(mg/Kg) and Ca (mg/Kg) in the wood of two tested species, for the F/I treatment. \n\n \n\nIn the Figure 4 graph of it can be seen that with the decreasing values of specific basic \n\nmass, there is an increase of iron content and a reduction in the calcium content of the wood \n\nof the clones for both species. \n\nWith irrigation associated to fertilization the availability and mobility of the soil \n\nnutrients increases, favoring their higher absorption by the plant and thus, greater \n\ndevelopment. Trees with rapid development, in general, show a reduction in their specific \n\nbasic mass  and low calcium accumulation (Gonzales et al., 2009). \n\nIt can be seen in Figure 4 that the iron content increased with decreasing specific \n\nbasic mass , which probably can be associated with the competition of manganese with iron \n\nand also the occurrence of a larger amount of Fe2+ in the soil, which is soluble and can be \n\nabsorbed by the plant in greater amounts, especially in irrigated crops (Mendon\u00e7a et al., \n\n2005).  \n\nOther factors, such as genetic characteristics and environmental conditions, may also \n\ninfluence the concentration of elements in different plant tissues, causing changes in nutrient \n\nuse efficiency (Silva, 2011). \n\n \n\nSpecific basic mass  \n\nOne of the most important properties of wood for cellulose production is its specific \n\nbasic mass, because it is directly related to the specific consumption of the wood, i.e. the \n\nvolume of wood needed to produce a given mass of cellulose. The higher the specific basic \n\nmass, the lower the wood consumption. This characteristic is strongly associated with the \n\nwood anatomy, with those less dense overall, having a higher pore diameter, which facilitates \n\nthe penetration of the reagents during the wood chemical deconstruction process. \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\nIn Figure 5, presents the specific basic mass values for the four clones and their \n\ntreatments. \n\n \n\nFigure 5. Mean values of specific basic mass of kg/cm3 clones, functioning as treatments, \n\nbeing: C/NI - Control no irrigated; T/NI - Traditional no irrigated; F/I - Ferti-irrigation. \n\nSlashes followed by the same small letter don\u2019t differ among themselves at 5% probability \n\n(Tukey, p>0,05). \n\n \n\nThrough the analysis of Figure 5, one can see that the means for the specific basic \n\nmass variable of the F/I treatments were lower in comparison with the other two treatments, \n\n(C/NI and T/NI). This fact can be explained by greater tree growth, when subjected to a \n\nstimulus caused by the increased availability of nutrients in the soil. \n\nThe variation of the specific basic mass is not only linked to the fertilization factor, \n\nother factors, such as genetic variation, water and light availability, the location of the tree in \n\nthe stand and spacing between individuals, also affect the specific basic mass . In previous \n\nstudies, the effect of fertilization on specific basic mass was also observed, where it decreased \n\nwith the use of fertilizer (Berger, 2000). \n\nFigure 5 shows that for clone A of the Eucalyptus grandis species, the variation in \n\nspecific basic mass between treatments C/NI and F/I was 8%, and for clones A and B of the \n\nhybrid Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus urophylla it was 11.2 and 1.3%, respectively, values \n\nthat are close to those found in the works cited by Berger (2000). \n\nIn Clone B of Eucalyptus grandis a decrease in the specific basic mass was not \n\nobserved; there was an increase. This fact may be related to the type of genetic material in the \n\nindividuals of this clone. Vital (1990) in his work, cites conflicting results, from the decrease \n\nto the increase of this property, caused by fertilization. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\nOverall, the ferti-irrigation caused a reduction in the specific basic mass of the wood , \n\nexcept for the clone B of Eucalyptus grandis which had its specific basic mass increased \n\nbecause of ferti-irrigation. The syringyl/guaiacyl ratio, manganese content and acetyl group \n\ncontents were influenced by the type of genetic material, with no effect of ferti-irrigation on \n\nsuch properties. \n\nThe ferti-irrigation technique, showed some negative aspects regarding the quality of \n\nthe wood of certain eucalyptus clones, it being relevant to consider the impact if this \n\ntechnique on the cellulose manufacturing production process. \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nAndrade, A.

Corn cobs, sugarcane bagasse and eucalypt wood were treated with \n\nsulfuric, hydrochloric and phosphoric acids as catalysts, with different acids concentrations (1.5 to 5.2 \n\nmol.L-1). In addition the eucalyptus liquor from pre-hydrolysis Kraft dissolving pulp production \n\nprocess was also investigated as a source of furfural, using sulfuric and hydrochloric acids as a \n\ncatalyst (0.9 and 3.9 mol.L-1). It was shown that furfural production is strongly influenced by the acid \n\ncatalyst concentration, the source of mineral acid and the raw material. Furfural productivity of 30.2, \n\n25.8 and 13.9% were achieved for corn cob, sugarcane bagasse and eucalypt wood, respectively, on \n\nthe basis of biomass dry weight. Conversion yield of pentose into furfural were 90.5, 83.6, 110.6% \n\nfor corn cob, sugarcane bagasse and eucalypt wood, respectively The HCl requirements were 5.2 \n\nmol.L-1 for both corn cob and sugarcane bagasse and 3.9 mol.L-1 for eucalypt wood. The yield of \n\nconversion from pentose to furfural using eucalypt liquor from the pre-hydrolysis Kraft process was \n\n71.5% using HCl 3.9 mol.L-1. So, it can be concluded that the use of hydro distillation process was a \nvery effective method for the furfural production from lignocellulosic residues by mineral acid \n\ncatalysis. The most attractive raw material was corn cobs which resulted in the highest furfural \n\nproduction (ex: 302 kg furfural/ dry ton of biomass), with sugarcane bagasse coming second. \n\nKeywords: Furfural, mineral acids, pre-hydrolysis, lignocellulosic material. \n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nThe interest for chemical production based on renewable source has increased in the \n\nlast decade due the declining reserves and increasing prices of fossil materials. Among the \n\ndifferent types of available biomass, agricultural crops, non-woody materials, annual plants or \n\ngrasses present a special interest due to their abundance, renewability and inexpensive source \n\nto obtain polymeric materials, energy or chemicals (Eg\u00fc\u00e9s et al., 2012a; Eg\u00fc\u00e9s et al., 2012b; \n\nSerrano et al., 2010). \n\nAgricultural and agro-industrial residues are mainly constituted by three structural \n\ncomponents (lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose) and each compound has specific properties \n\ndestined for different uses for chemical production. Biomass residues available from \n\nagricultural and forest processing constitute a potential source for chemical production such \n\nas ethanol, reducing sugars and furfural, using enzyme or acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. All \n\npentosans containing fibrous material could in theory be used as raw material for furfural \n\nproduction; however, the furfural industrial production requires minimum pentosans content \n\naround 15 to 20% (Yahyazadeh, 2011). Only about one third of the pentosans in the raw \n\nmaterials can be converted into furfural by means of existing production processes. \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\nFurfural is an important chemical because it is a selective solvent for separating \n\nsaturated and unsaturated compounds in petroleum refining, gas, oil and diesel fuel and for \n\nthe high demand of its derivatives, especially furfuryl alcohol, used mainly in the production \n\nof furan resins for foundry sand binders, which is consider the major market for furfural \n\n(V\u00e1zquez et al., 2007). So far, there is no synthetic route available for furfural production in \n\nthe chemical industry, consequently it is exclusively produced by acid hydrolysis and \n\ndehydration of pentoses (mainly xylose) contained in lignocellulosic biomass (like corn cobs, \n\ncotton stalk, sunflower stalk, sugarcane bagasse, etc.) (Riansa-ngawong and Prasertsan, 2011; \n\nV\u00e1zquez et al., 2007; Yemi? and Mazza, 2011). \n\nThere are two main types of technologies to produce furfural. First one it is an one-\n\nstage technology, when the pentosans depolymerization in xylose and dehydration to furfural \n\noccur simultaneously (Perego and Bianchi, 2010; Serrano et al., 2010). The second one is the \n\ntwo-stage technology, when the dissolution and depolymerization of pentosans occur under \n\nmild conditions, followed by dehydration of xylose to furfural (S\u00e1nchez et al., 2013). The \n\nadvantage of the two-stage technology is that the residual lignocellulose is less degraded and \n\ncan be used for conversion to other chemicals (glucose, ethanol, phenols, etc.) in a subsequent \n\nstep. The scheme of reactions for furfural production is given in Figure 1 (Ribeiro et al., \n\n2012). \n\nO\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\nO\n\nOH2\n+\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOHH\n+\n\n-H2O\nO\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nO\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\nO CHO\n\nH\n\nOH\n\nHO\n\nO\nOH\n\n+OH2\n\nOH\n\nOH\n-H2O\n\n-H2O\n\nO\nCHO\n\nOH\n\n-H2O O\nCHO\n\n \nFigure 1. Dehydration of xylose to form furfural (Ribeiro et al., 2012). \n\nSeveral researchers investigated the production of furfural by hydrolysis of \n\nlignocellulosic residue materials in the presence of mineral acid as catalyst, such as \n\nhydrochloric acid - HCl (Herrera et al., 2004; Lavarack et al., 2002; Yemi? and Mazza, 2012), \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\nnitric acid - HNO3 (Rodr??guez-Chong et al., 2004), sulfuric acid - H2SO4 (Bamufleh et al., \n\n2013; Riansa-ngawong and Prasertsan, 2011; Yat et al., 2008) and phosphoric acid - H3PO4 \n\n(G\u00e1mez et al., 2006; Lenihan et al., 2010; V\u00e1zquez et al., 2007). Raw materials used to \n\nfurfural production reported in the literature included sugarcane bagasse (G\u00e1mez et al., 2006; \n\nRodr??guez-Chong et al., 2004), timber (Yat et al., 2008), date-palm trees (Bamufleh et al., \n\n2013), sorghum straw (Herrera et al., 2004; V\u00e1zquez et al., 2007), eucalypt (Garc\u00eda-\n\nDom\u00ednguez et al., 2013), corn cobs (Garrote et al., 2007; S\u00e1nchez et al., 2013), rice hull \n\n(Mansilla et al., 1998) and rice straw (Amiri et al., 2010).  \n\nCurrently, many studies have been developed for using lignocellulosic materials as \n\nfeedstock for chemicals production, such as furfural, for example (S\u00e1nchez et al., 2013; Liu et \n\nal., 2013). In this context, are applied the biorefinery concept, which use pretreatments for an \n\norganized deconstruction of the biomass aiming bioproducts and chemicals production. \n\nAmong the pre-treatments for lignocellulosic biomass, the pre-hydrolysis treatment recovers \n\nhigh quantities of hemicelluloses, converting them into soluble saccharides, while both \n\ncellulose and lignin are largely retained in the solid phase (Liu et al., 2010). The solid fraction \n\nobtained from the pre-hydrolysis treatments can be used for bioethanol production or some \n\nbiobased added-value products (Batalha et al., 2012; Behin and Zeyghami, 2009).  The liquid \n\nhemicellulose-rich stream, can be used as raw material for furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural \n\nand alcohol production and to extract phenols from the dissolved lignin fractions (Garrote et \n\nal., 2006; Carvalheiro et al., 2008; Alvarado-Morales et al., 2009; Garrote et al., 2004).  \n\nThe aim of this study was investigating furfural production from corn cob, sugarcane \n\nbagasse and eucalypt wood using different concentrations of mineral acids (hydrochloric, \n\nsulfuric and phosphoric acids) through the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. In addition, the \n\neucalypt liquor from the pre-hydrolysis Kraft process was investigated for furfural production, \n\nusing hydrochloric and sulfuric acid as catalysts. \n\n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nMaterials \n\nCorn cob (CC) and sugarcane bagasse (SCB) harvested at Federal University of \n\nVi\u00e7osa, a Brazilian experimental station, and also, the Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus \n\ngrandis chips (EUCA) supplied by a Brazilian forest company were used in this study. The \n\nraw materials were dried at room temperature and grinded in a laboratory mill, then sieved \n\nand classified according to T257 cm-12 standard procedure (Tappi, 2012a). All samples were \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\nextracted with ethanol/toluene 1:2, ethanol 95% and hot water and subjected to moisture \n\ndetermination in accordance with T264 cm-07 (Tappi, 2007).  \n\n \n\nQuantitative Chemical Characterization \n\nThe carbohydrate composition of raw materials was determined by High Performance \n\nAnion Exchange Chromatography with Pulse Amperometric Detection (HPAEC-PAD) after \n\npre-treatment (30\u00b0C, 1 h) of the materials with aqueous 72% H2SO4 followed by hydrolysis \n\nwith 3% H2SO4 in an autoclave (100\u00b0C, 3 h). HPAEC-PAD was carried out in a Dionex ICS-\n\n3000 system equipped with a CarboPac PA1 (250 x 4mm) analytical column. The \n\nmonosaccharides were separated isocratically with 0.001 M NaOH (45 min, flowrate 1 \n\nmL/min) according to (Wallis et al., 1996). The solid residue after hydrolysis was considered \n\nas Klason lignin according to T222 cm-11 standard procedure (Tappi, 2011). Ashes were \n\ndetermined by calcination according to TAPPI standard T211 om-12 (Tappi, 2012b). Acid \n\nsoluble lignin was determined by measuring the UV-absorbance of the filtrate at 205 nm \n\naccording (Goldschimid, 1971). Total uronic acids in raw materials hydrolysates were \n\nmeasured by the colorimetric method involving 3,5-dimethylphenol addition according to \n\nScott (1979). The acetyl group content in samples wood was determined according to Solar et \n\nal. (1987). All results were calculated from two replicate determinations. \n\n \n\nPre-hydrolysis (PH) \n\nThe pre-hydrolysis treatment for EUCA chips was carried out in 7 liter M/K digester \n\nequipped with a heat exchanger, circulating pump, and computer-controlled time and \n\ntemperature, under the following fixed conditions: 1000 g oven-dry (OD) of chips, 4/1 (m3/t) \n\nliquid/material ratio, 170\u00b0C maximum temperature, 90 minutes to maximum temperature, 15 \n\nminutes at maximum temperature, and 2.5 to 3.0 final pH. \n\n \n\nHydro distillation  \n\nFurfural production in the two-stage process was carried out initially with a pre-\n\nhydrolysis of 1 g OD sample in a boiling flask with 100 mL of mineral acids at different \n\nconcentration and reflux times (time was recorded immediately after initiation of boiling). \n\nThe flask was connected to the simple distillation apparatus, so it was added 300 mL of \n\nmineral acids into separatory funnel, previously assembled as in T223 cm-10 (Tappi, 2010). \n\nDuring the boiling time, furfural was recovered by steam distillation. In the next step, the \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\nhydrolysate was heated and the distillate was collected in a 500 mL erlenmeyer flask \n\nimmersed in an ice bath. For each 30 mL of hydrolysate obtained in the distillation, it was \n\nadded 30 mL acid until reached 300 mL of hydrolysate. Results were calculated from two \n\nreplicate determinations. \n\n \n\nFurfural production  \n\nThe raw materials (CC, SBC and EUCA) were used for furfural production by hydro \n\ndistillation, while the hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and phosphoric acid \n\n(H3PO4) were used as catalysts to improve the reaction. The experimental parameters of the \n\nacid catalysts concentrations used, for each raw material was following concentrations: 1.5; \n\n2.3; 2.6; 3.0; 3.9 and 5.2 mol.L-1. \n\nFrom the hemicelluloses present in the EUCA pre-hydrolysate, furfural was obtained \n\nby two different experimental designs. In the experimental design with H2SO4 the following \n\nconditions were used: temperature 170\u00b0C, 0.9 mol.L-1, 3 hours reaction time and 3/1 \n\nliquid/solid ratio (Mamman et al., 2008). The experimental design with HCl (3.9 mol.L-1) \n\nused to determine the maximum production of furfural was by hydro distillation \n\ntransformations of pentoses into furfural. \n\n \n\nFurfural quantification \n\nFurfural was determined using a spectrophotometric method developed by Nascimento \n\net al. (1998). The analysis is based on the reaction of furfural with aniline in acetic acid and \n\nethanol 95% to stabilize the colour. The test was conducted in the dark and under stirring for \n\n15 minutes. Spectral analyses were done at 510 nm (Varian Cary 50 Probe UV-visible, \n\nU.S.A.) and compared with a calibration curve for pure furfural, and the furfural productivity \n\nwas calculated by according to Equation 1:  \n\n(1)                    % 100 x \nw\n\nw\ntyproductivi Furfural %\n\n1\n\n 0\n?\n\n               \n\n \n\nwhere: w0= furfural mass concentration of total distillate; w1= the total mass of raw material. \n\nThe furfural conversion yield was calculated according to Equation 2: \n\n(2)                                 % 100 x \nw\n\nw\nyield Furfural  %\n\n2\n\n 0\n?  \n\nwhere: w0= furfural mass concentration of total distillate; w2= the mass of pentose (xylose and \n\narabinose) in raw material. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nChemical composition of raw materials \n\nThe chemical compositions of CC, SCB and EUCA (percentage on oven-dry weight \n\nbasis) are showed in Table 1, based on two replicate determinations. The raw materials are \n\ndefined by their content of glucose, xylose, arabinose, galactose, mannose, acetyl groups, \n\nlignin, ash and uronic acid. Due to the presence of ash, acid insoluble lignin analysis gave an \n\noverestimation to lignin content; therefore, the lignin values were corrected by their ash \n\ncontent (Angl\u00e9s et al., 1997).  \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1.Chemical composition results of CC, SCB, EUCA and reported by other authors. \n\n \n\nComponent,% \nCorn cob (CC) \n\nResults Van Dongen et al., 2011 Lili et al., 2011 Garrote et al., 2007 \n\nGlucose 47.1 34 34.6 34.3a \n\nXylose 28.0 28 27.0 31.1a \n\nArabinose 5.4 2.4 3.6 3.01a \n\nGalactose 2.2 0.8 - - \n\nMannose 0.2 0.1 - - \n\nAcetyl groups 2.9 - 0.3 3.07 \n\nUronic acids 2.2 1.8 - 3.45 \n\nLigninc 17.8 18.3 9.4b 18.8 \n\nAsh 1.2 - 2.5 1.3 \n\nComponent,% \nSugarcane bagasse (SCB) \n\nResults Hamzeh et al., 2013 Alves et al., 2010 Canilha et al., 2007 \n\nGlucose 46.4 40.5d 43.1 48.2 \n\nXylose 28.2 14.5 23.8 24.8 \n\nArabinose 2.6 2.2 1.5 1.66 \n\nGalactose 1.0 2.6 0.4 - \n\nMannose 1.0 - 0.3 - \n\nAcetyl groups 3.0 - 3.0e 2.83 \n\nUronic acids 1.5 - 1.2 - \n\nLigninc 21.4 28.2 23.2 24.1 \n\nAsh 2.3 4.8 2.5 - \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\nComponent,% \nEucalypt (EUCA) \n\nResults Garc\u00eda-Dom\u00ednguez  et al., 2013 Batalha et al., 2012 Alves et al., 2010 \n\nGlucose 53.1 42.8 47.9a 46.5 \n\nXylose 12.3 17.1 11.2a 12.1 \n\nArabinose 0.3 0.4 0.1a 0.5 \n\nGalactose 2.1 - 0.9a 1.2 \n\nMannose 1.4 - 0.9a 1.0 \n\nAcetyl groups 2.8 3.5 2.0 2.8e \n\nUronic acids 3.1 - 5.9 2.2 \n\nLigninc 30.1 21.2 26.6 29.2 \n\nAsh 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.3 \n\na All sugars expressed as anhydro-units in polymers; \nb Lignin values were measured as acid insoluble lignin contents; \nc Lignin values were measured as acid insoluble lignin contents and acid soluble; \nd Glucose values measured were ?-cellulose contents; \ne Acetyl groups values were measured by NMR. \n\n \n\nAlso, the data showed that the pentose content (xylose + arabinose) were 33.4% for \n\nCC, 30.8% for SCB and 12.6% for EUCA, which constitute an adequate content comparable \n\nto that found in wheat hulls, cotton seeds, and nut shells commonly used for furfural \n\nproduction. Because of the current importance of lignin as a raw material for the production \n\nof bioproducts and biofuels (Buranov and Mazza, 2008), samples were also analyzed for their \n\nacid insoluble lignin and acid soluble lignin.  \n\nThe chemical composition of CC showed that total lignin was 17.8%, while their \n\nuronic acid and ash contents were 2.2% and 1.2%, respectively. In relation to glucose content \n\n(47.1%), the experimental result was higher than reported by other authors (Van Dongen et \n\nal., 2011; Lili et al., 2011; Garrote et al., 2007), fact which can be explained by the method \n\nused by each author for quantification of carbohydrates. Values of xylose, 28.0%; arabinose, \n\n5.4%; mannose, 0.2%; and acetyl groups, 2.9%; for samples determined in this study are \n\nclosely comparable to those reported by them (Van Dongen et al., 2011; Garrote et al., 2007) \n\nfor similar samples. \n\nThe structural carbohydrates (glucose and xylose) which are the major substrates for \n\nfuran production, accounted for approximately 74.6% of the SCB (Table 1). These values are \n\nin the range found by other workers for this kind of materials (Alves et al., 2010; Canilha et \n\nal., 2007; Hamzeh et al., 2013). It is well known that pentoses and hexoses, respectively, are \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\n \n\nthe precursors for furfural and HMF formed during the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass \n\n(Yemis and Mazza, 2011). Determination of the initial quantity of the main constituents \n\navailable in biomass allowed for the calculation of the yields and theoretical conversion rates \n\nof furfural from raw material for calculation of efficiency of furfural production.  \n\nThe chemical composition of the Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus grandis hybrid \n\nwas similar to reported for  other eucalyptus  reported by other authors (Batalha et al., 2012; \n\nAlves et al., 2010), except in relation to glucose content (53.1%) as showed in Table 1. \n\nHowever, glucose values similar to the one observed in this work has been previously \n\nreported (Mokfienski et al., 2008). \n\n \n\nPre-hydrolysis  \n\nThe pre-hydrolysis (PH) has the advantage or removing significant amounts of xylans. \n\nIn comparison to acid hydrolysis, autohydrolysis generates lower quantities of   byproduct, \n\nminimizes equipment corrosion, and decrease operational costs. The eucalypt xylan content \n\ndecreased 48.9%, from 12.3% in the original material to 7.1% in the PH chips. The yield loss \n\nin the pre-hydrolysis treatment was 11.4%, (Table 2). According to a literature, the liquor \n\nderived from the PH treatment contains a mixture of sugar oligomers mostly xylo-\n\noligosaccharides (XOS), monosaccharides (xylose and arabinose), acetic acid (from acetyl \n\ngroups) and sugar decomposition products. Moreover, it was found that the formation rate of \n\nthese compounds depends on the autohydrolysis conditions, e.g. temperature and reaction \n\ntime, in agreement with previous reports (Pu et al., 2011; Garrote et al., 1999). \n\n \n\nTable 2. Eucalypt chip Pre-hydrolysis (PH) result. \n\n \n\nFurfural production \n\nSulfuric, hydrochloric and phosphoric acids are widely used as catalysts in industrial \n\nfurfural production. The results of Figure 2 indicate the productivities of the furfural \n\nproduction with different acids for CC, SCB and CC. The furfural productivity increases with \n\nincreasing acid concentration regardless of raw material and acid type. The highest furfural \n\nproductivities were achieved with HCl as catalyst. Based on the biomass dry weight, \n\nproductivities of 30.2, 25.8 and 13.9% were obtained for CC, SCB and EUCA, respectively. \n\nPH Result Yield, % \nXylans, % \n\non wt. \n\nXylans \n\nRemoval, % \n\nSpent \n\nliquor pH \n\nHydrolyzate \n\nsolids, % \n\nEUCA 88.6 7.1 48.9 2.5 2.2 \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\n \n\nThis productivity was achieved with 5.2 mol.L-1 HCl for CC and SCB and 3.9 mol.L-1 HCl for \n\nEUCA. When H2SO4 was used as catalyst, the maximum productivities attained were 27.3, \n\n21.0 and 11.4% for CC, SCB and EUCA, respectively, under the same acid molar \n\nconcentrations previously reported for HCl. In the case of H3PO4, the highest furfural \n\nproductivities were 26.0, 18.2, 7.6 for CC, SCB and EUCA, respectively, under the same acid \n\nmolar concentrations previously reported for HCl. \n\nYemis and Mazza (2010) reported an increase in furfural productivity from xylose \n\nfrom 9.3 to 36.1 g/100 g when the HCl concentration increased from 0.01 to 0.1 mol.L-1. \n\nRecently, Rong et al. (2012) reported that the furfural productivity was higher in high \n\nconcentration of H2SO4 systems compared to that in low concentration and the highest \n\nfurfural conversion efficiency (75%) was achieved with 10% (w/w) H2SO4, but the \n\nconversion efficiency decreased to 51% when the concentration of H2SO4 was raised to \n\n12.5% (w/w). \n\nThe fact that the highest furfural productivity obtained in this study was with HCl can \n\nbe explained by the greater availability of H+ ions in HCl solutions compared to phosphoric \n\nand sulfuric acid solutions at a given molar concentration. Similar results have been reported \n\nby (Yemi? and Mazza, 2011) comparing the effect of four strong mineral acids (hydrochloric, \n\nsulfuric, nitric, and phosphoric acids) and two organic acids - acetic (CH3COOH) and formic \n\nacids (HCOOH) on furfural yield. The furfural productivities obtained from xylose in the \n\npresence of HCl, H2SO4, HNO3 (nitric acid), H3PO4, CH3COOH and HCOOH were 37.5%, \n\n31.9%, 3.5%, 27.6%, 15.8%, and 23.8% at pH 1.12, respectively.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Furfural productivities on the basis of CC, SCB, and EUCA dry weight for various \n\nmineral acid catalysts concentrations. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\n \n\nThe gradual decrease in furfural concentration beyond the maximum value achieved \n\nindicates that beyond certain achieved furfural concentration the rate of furfural loss to \n\ndecomposition products becomes higher than the rate of furfural production. Moreover, the \n\nnature of the solvent chosen and the biomass type were the major factors influencing \n\nconversion of pentose to furfural. So, the furfural conversion yield is an important parameter, \n\nfor each raw material used in this study, in order to know the rate of pentose conversion into \n\nfurfural. The results for furfural conversion yield are shown in Figure 3. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Furfural conversion yield on the basis of CC, SCB, and EUCA pentose contents for \n\nvarious mineral acid catalysts concentrations. \n\n \n\nAccording to Figure 3, the furfural conversion yield was higher for EUCA in relation \n\nto CC and SCB, when HCl and H2SO4 were used as catalysts. The highest furfural conversion \n\nyield was found when HCl was used as catalyst reaching 90.5% for CC (5.2 mol.L-1) 83.6% \n\nfor SCB (5.2 mol.L-1) and 110.6% for EUCA (3.9 mol.L-1). The highest furfural conversion \n\nyields for H2SO4 were 81.6 (5.2 mol.L\n-1), 68.1 (5.2 mol.L-1) and 90.6 (3.0 mol.L-1) for CC, \n\nSCB and EUCA, respectively. Finally, the highest conversion yields for H3PO4 were 77.8 (5.2 \n\nmol.L-1), 59.2 (5.2 mol.L-1) and 60.6% (3.9 mol.L-1) for CC, SCB and EUCA, respectively. \n\nThese results indicate that the initial pentose concentration is a very important parameter for \n\nfurfural conversion yield. Yang et al. (2012) reported that furfural conversion yield decreased \n\nfrom 70 to 60% when the xylose concentration increased from 40 to 120 g/L. It could be \n\nconcluded that furfural conversion yield decreases with increasing pentose concentration.  \n\nThis fact may be explained considering that furfural formation is followed by side \n\nreactions, such as resinification of the furfural formed, condensation of furfural with pentose-\n\nto-furfural intermediates and fragmentation of pentose, all of which decrease the furfural \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\nconversion yield. According to Dunlop (1951), the initial pentose concentration greatly affects \n\nthe maximum obtainable furfural conversion yield in an aqueous solution. The dilute pentose \n\nconcentrations helps reducing the undesirable side reactions between furfural and its \n\nprecursors, such as the resinification of the furfural produced (Figure 4), condensation of the \n\nfurfural with pentose-to-furfural intermediates. \n\n \n\nFigure 4. Reaction resinification of the furfural. \n\n \n\nHowever, in commercial processes, low initial pentose concentrations are undesirable \n\nsince they require larger reactors and more heat to produce the furfural. So, for economical \n\nreasons, initial pentose concentration should not be too low. The optimal initial pentose \n\nconcentration is also decided by furfural yield, operating costs, and the pentose concentration \n\nin the hydrolysate.  \n\nA low initial concentration of pentoses showed high furfural conversion yield, \n\nhowever the overall cost per gallon of furfural produced is a much better criterion for a \n\nprocess design than the achievement of high furfural productivities. \n\nThe mass balance of total furfural production is shown in Figure 5. Among the raw \n\nmaterials, CC was one with high furfural productivity in relation of SCB and EUCA, but \n\nEUCA was one with higher furfural conversion yield than the others raw materials used in \n\nthis study. Overall, the best raw material for furfural production was corn cobs, and HCl was \n\nthe best catalyst. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5. Mass balance of the furfural production from CC, SCB and EUCA. \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\nFurfural production from EUCA pre-hydrolysis liquor \n\nThe highest furfural concentration obtained from EUCA pre-hydrolysis liquor using \n\n3.9 mol.L-1 of HCl as catalyst, by hydro distillation, was 9.3 g/L. This furfural concentration \n\ncorresponds to a furfural productivity of 8.8% and conversion yield of 71.5% respect to total \n\npentoses present in the EUCA liquor PH. A 9.2 g/L of furfural concentration was obtained \n\nusing 0.9 mol.L-1 H2SO4 as catalyst for 3 hours at 170\u00b0 C; this concentration corresponds to a \n\nfurfural productivity of 8.8%, conversion yield of 70.8% respect to pentoses in the EUCA \n\nliquor PH.  \n\nFrom the xylans obtained from EUCA pre-hydrolysis high concentration of furfural \n\ncan be produced. It is a way of consuming renewable agro-industrial residues of dissolving \n\npulp production. From 1 Ton of dissolving pulp, it is possible to produce 100 kg of furfural, \n\nconsuming 1537 kg of HCl. The process must be improved giving its poor economics. \n\nFurfural production from CC, SCB, EUCA, and EUCA liquor PH (liquors rich in \n\nxylans) can be achieved using high concentration mineral acid catalyst. Thus, it is relevant to \n\nconsiderer the amount of acid spent in the processes (g produced furfural/g spent acid).  A \n\nsummary of optimum conditions for furfural production on the basis of the results of this \n\nstudy are show in Table 3.  \n\n \n\nTable 3.

The syringyl/guaiacyl ratio, manganese content and acetyl group content were \n\ninfluenced by the type of genetic material, with no effect of ferti-irrigation on such properties. \n\nThe ferti-irrigation technique decreased the specific basic mass of certain eucalyptus \n\nclones, making it relevant to consider the negative aspects regarding the quality of the wood, \n\nin the cellulose manufacturing production process. \n\nIn the second part of this paper we present a preliminary study on the production of \n\nfurfural from different lignocellulosic materials. We concluded that the maximum \n\nperformance, productivity and yield of furfural were found when HCl was used as a catalyst \n\nin the steam distillation process compared to H2SO4 and H3PO4. The raw material with the \n\nhighest furfural production was the corn cob, sugarcane bagasse being second best. The \n\nfurfural productivity was directly proportional to the pentoses content in the raw material, but \n\nthe yield proceeded inversely, increasing with the decreasing concentrations of pentoses. \n\nThe eucalyptus liquor from pre-hydrolysis Kraft dissolving pulp production, proved to \n\nbe technically feasible for the production of furfural, but should be improved so that it \n\nbecomes economically viable. \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\n \n\nAPPENDIX \n\nSpecies Treatments \nGlucans \n\n(%) \n\nXylans \n\n(%) \n\nGalactans \n\n(%) \n\nMannans \n\n(%) \n\nArabinans \n\n(%) \n\nUronic
