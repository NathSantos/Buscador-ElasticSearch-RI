This study evaluates the impact of using impre-\ncise data in short-term planning. The exhaustive Walker Lake dataset is used and is \nconsidered as the source for obtaining the true grades. Initially, samples are obtained \nfrom the exhaustive dataset at regularly spaced grids of 20 \u00d7 20 m and 5 \u00d7 5 m. A \nrelative error (imprecision) of \u00b125% and a 10% bias are added to the data spaced at \n5 \u00d7 5 m (short-term geological data) in different scenarios. To combine these different \ntypes of data, two methodologies are investigated: cokriging and ordinary kriging. \nBoth types of data are used to estimate blocks with the two methodologies. The grade \ntonnage curves and swath plots are used to compare the results against the true block \ngrade distribution. In addition, the block misclassification is evaluated. The results \nshow that standardized ordinary cokriging is a better methodology for imprecise and \nbiased data and produces estimates closer to the true grade block distribution, reduc-\ning block misclassification.\n\nkeywords: biased samples, grade estimates, kriging, cokriging.\n\nResumo\n\nDecis\u00f5es relacionadas \u00e0 explora\u00e7\u00e3o mineral e \u00e0 opera\u00e7\u00e3o da mina est\u00e3o subor-\ndinadas aos modelos de blocos obtidos a partir das amostras.

Introduction\n\nIn the mining industry, decisions \nfrom mineral exploration through to \nmining operations are based on grade \n\nblock models obtained from samples. \nIt is common for data to be collected in \nvarious formats, and consequently, have \n\nvarying precision and accuracy.

During production, samples are \nusually collected from blastholes, which \nmay lead to large sampling errors in \nterms of either bias or precision (GOO-\nVAERTS, 1997: GY, 1998). From a \n\ngeostatistical perspective, this difference \nin precision has to be taken into account \nso that the two types of data can be com-\nbined. The aim of this paper is to inves-\ntigate two geostatistical methodologies \nfor integration of data: ordinary kriging \n(JOURNEL &amp; HUIJBREGTS, 1978) \n\nand standardized ordinary cokriging \n(GOOVAERTS, 1997).The estimates for \neach scenario were compared with a ref-\nerence block grade model. As blasthole \nsampling is mainly used for short-term \ngrade models, the results emphasize the \nimpact of block misclassification.\n\n2. Material and method\n\n2.1 Data presentation\nThis study uses the exhaustive \n\nWalker Lake dataset (ISAAKS &amp; SRIV-\nASTAVA, 1989) with 78 000 point \nsupport samples distributed regularly at \n1 \u00d7 1 m. The variable V was used and \nthe original unit was rescaled so that it \nresembled grades from a copper mineral \ndeposit. To obtain the reference block \ngrade distribution, the exhaustive point \n\nsupport dataset was averaged into 3210 \nblocks of size 5 \u00d7 5 m. These blocks \nrepresented the true block grades, and \nwere used for comparison.\n\nIn this case study, the data were \ntotally heterotopic and of varying qual-\nity. Two types of data were considered. \nFirst, samples were obtained from the \nexhaustive point support dataset at a \n\nregular spacing of 20 \u00d7 20 m. These \nsamples were precise and accurate and \nmimicked diamond-drillholed samples. \nOther samples were obtained from the \nexhaustive point support dataset at a \nregular spacing of 5 \u00d7 5 m, and impreci-\nsion and bias were added. Figure 1 shows \nthe regular spacing between samples in \nthis case study.\n\n20 m\n\n5 m\n\nV data with precise and accurate (20x20 meters)\n\nV data with imprecision and bias (5x5 meters)\n\nFigure 1\nDataset with a regular spacing grid.\n\n2.2 Adding imprecision\nSampling aims to obtain a rep-\n\nresentative sample, i.e., one that is \naccurate and precise. For good-quality \ndata, it is expected that for the mea-\nsured values, there is no trend (or bias) \n\nin the errors; i.e., the errors should \nhave zero mean and follow a Gaussian \ndistribution. When there is a system-\natic tendency in the errors to over- (or \nunder-) estimate the real values, the \n\nestimator begins to produce systemati-\ncally biased estimates of the true value \nof the attribute, and the associated \nerror distribution departs from having \na zero mean.\n\n2.3 Adding variance (increasing imprecision)\nThe original samples obtained from \n\nthe exhaustive dataset at a 5 \u00d7 5 m regular \nspacing were disturbed by adding (or sub-\ntracting) a random relative sampling error \nof 10%. The relative error was assumed \n\nto be a standard Gaussian with zero mean \nand with a standard deviation determined \nby the product of the relative error (\u00b110%) \nand the grade (MAGRI &amp; ORTIZ, \n2000). These samples mimicked blasthole \n\nsamples, which have a poorer precision \nthan diamond-drillholed data. The error \nwas assumed to be heteroscedastic, which \nis frequently the case in practice (GOO-\nVAERTS, 1997; MATHERON, 1963).\n\n2.4 Adding error bias\nNot only was the imprecision of \n\nthe secondary data increased, but also \na bias was added. For a 25% bias, the \ngrades had their mean either increased \nor decreased by 25% (MAGRI &amp; OR-\nTIZ, 2000). \n\nTable I shows the summary sta-\ntistics of the reference point support \n\ndataset (V_Real_points), the reference \nblock support dataset (V_Real_blocks), \nand the sample dataset with accurate \nand precise data (V_20\u00d720). The sample \ndatasets had means very close to the \ntrue mean, which indicates that there \nwere no biases or precision errors. \nThe data with bias and precision er-\n\nrors (V_5\u00d75_+25% and V_5\u00d75_?25%) \nhad means that were 25% greater (or \nsmaller) than those of the reference \nblock distribution (V_Real_blocks), \nto mimic the situation in which poor-\nquality data induce biases that are \nsubsequently transferred to the grade \nestimation process.\n\n\n\n223\n\nCristina Paix\u00e3o Ara\u00fajo and Jo\u00e3o Felipe Coimbra Leite Costa\n\nREM: R.

The dataset \n(V_20\u00d720) comprised 195 samples that \nwere 20 \u00d7 20 m apart. The variogram \nin this case was defined by equation (1) \nbelow. In the other cases, the two types \nof data were pooled together. \n\nThe second alternative that was \n\ntested ignored the differences in ac-\ncuracy and precision between the two \nsources of information (primary and \nsecondary). Scenario 2 combined ac-\ncurate and precise data (V_20\u00d720) and \ndata with biases and precision errors \nadded (V_5\u00d75_+25%), whereas scenario \n3 pooled together accurate and precise \ndata (V_20\u00d720) and data with systematic \n\nlower grades (bias) and greater impreci-\nsion (V_5\u00d75_?25%). Accurate data and \ndata with biases and precision errors \nwere combined for estimation purposes. \nThe variograms in this case were defined \nby equations (2) and (3) below.\n\nS cenario 1: Ordinar y kriging \nwith 195 precise and accurate data \n(V_20\u00d720):\n\n?\nv\n(h) = 1.0 + 2.0  Sph (1) N157.5E\n\n90 m\nN67.5E\n40 m\n\n. .. , N157.5E\n120 m\n\nN67.5E\n60 m\n\n. ,+ 2.92 Sph (2)\n\nScenario 2: Ordinary kriging with \n3120 data of different quality pooled \n\ntogether (V_20\u00d720 and V_5\u00d75_+25%, \nimprecise and inaccurate):\n\n?\nv\n(h) = 1.50 + 3.0 Sph (1) N157.5E\n\n35 m\nN67.5E\n25 m\n\n. .. , N157.5E\n80 m\n\nN67.5E\n44 m\n\n. ,+ 5.10 Sph (2)\n\nScenario 3: Ordinary kriging with \n3120 data of different quality pooled \n\ntogether (V_20\u00d720 and V_5\u00d75_?25%, \nimprecise and inaccurate):\n\n?\nv\n(h) = 0.7 + 1.3 Sph (1) N157.5E\n\n37 m\nN67.5E\n28 m\n\n. .. , N157.5E\n82 m\n\nN67.5E\n41 m\n\n. ,+ 1.78 Sph (2)\n\n2.5.2 Standardized ordinary cokriging estimator\nStandardized ordinary cokriging \n\nwas thoroughly explained by GOO-\nVAERTS (1997). This is a suitable frame-\nwork for incorporating data of variable \nquality. It takes into consideration the \nspatial auto- and cross-correlations \namong the variables involved. The meth-\nod also filters bias from the inaccurate \ndataset, proceeding with standardized \nresiduals instead of the original data. It \nuses standardized ordinary cokriging \n(GOOVAERTS, 1997), in which the \nsum of the weights for the primary and \nsecondary variables is 1. Spatial continu-\nity is defined using the linear model of \ncoregionalization (LMC). During the \n\ncokriging process, the LMC controls \nthe weights allocated to the secondary \ndata. The cross-correlation is obtained \nusing the cross-covariance, since the \ncross-variogram requires collocated \ndata (isotopic multivariate dataset). If \nthe cross-covariance resembles the di-\nrect variograms, the secondary data are \ntreated as primary in terms of weights \nduring the cokriging procedure (MIN-\nNITT &amp; DEUTSCH, 2014).\n\nThere is obviously no nugget ef-\nfect on the cross-covariance, since there \nare no collocated data. However, the \nintersection point on the y-axis can be \nobtained only by extrapolating the trend \n\nof the covariance at nonzero lags. Equa-\ntions (4), (5), and (6) below show the \nspatial direct and cross-correlations for \nscenario 4, where the primary variable \nis the V sample (accurate and precise), \nwhereas the secondary variable com-\nprises additional samples from V with \nbiases (higher means) and precision er-\nrors added (V_5\u00d75_+25%). Scenario 5 \nincludes the primary variable V sample \n(accurate and precise) (V_20\u00d720), where-\nas the secondary variable is the V sample \nwith biases (lower means) and precision \nerrors added (V_5\u00d75_?25%). The LMC \nadjustment is shown in equations (7), \n(8), and (9).\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n\n\nREM: R. Esc.

Consequently, the estimates \n\nusing ordinary kriging with few precise \nand accurate data produced a poorer \ngrade tonnage curve. The grade above \ncutoff predicted by ordinary kriging was \nunder-estimated. Also, the largest devia-\ntions of the predicted tonnage from the \n\ntrue model occurred with the ordinary \nkriging block model. The best results were \nachieved with ordinary cokriging.

The slope of the regression \nline is greater than 1, showing that the \nresults under-estimate the real grades. \nThe proposed solution is inappropriate, \nsince it can lead to either over- or under-\nestimation of the blocks, depending on \nhow the bias in the secondary data af-\nfects the grades.\n\n100.00\n\n90.00\n\n80.00\n\n70.00\n\n60.00\n\n50.00\n\n40.00\n\n30.00\n\n20.00\n\n10.00\n\n0.00\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n0.00\n\n8.00\n\n7.00\n\n6.00\n\n5.00\n\n4.00\n\n3.00\n\n2.00\n\n1.00\n\nReference Model\n\nV_OK_195\n\nSCOK_-25%\n\nSCOK_+25%\n\nM\nin\n\nin\ng \n\nR\nec\n\no\nve\n\nry\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nG\nra\n\nd\ne \n\nab\no\n\nve\n c\n\nu\nto\n\nff\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nCut-Off Grade (%)\n\n\n\nREM: R.

Five cutoffs were \nconsidered: 0.93%, 1.73%, 2.35%, \n4.24%, and 5.34%. It can be seen from \nFigure 6 that standardized ordinary \n\ncokriging generated the best result in \nterms of block misclassification for all \nthe cutoffs considered. The difference is \nevident. At 1.73%, the number of mis-\nclassified blocks is approximately 620 \nusing standardized ordinary cokriging. \nIn the case of ordinary kriging with \naccurate and precise data, the number \nincreases to 875. However, ordinary \n\nkriging erroneously sent much more \nwaste to the plant, causing dilution. \nEven worse, the ordinary kriging model \nsent far more ore blocks to the waste \npile. The better results with regard to \nblock misclassification shown by ordi-\nnary cokriging are consistent with the \nscatterplots between true and estimated \nblock values (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 6\nBlock misclassification: \n(a) total number of blocks misclassified; \n(b) number of ore blocks \nclassified as waste; \n(c) number of waste blocks \nclassified as ore.\n\n6.00\n\n5.00\n\n4.00\n\n3.00\n\n2.00\n\n1.00\n\n0.00\n\n5.00\n\n4.00\n\n3.00\n\n2.00\n\n1.00\n\n0.00\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 280\n\nReference Model\n\nOK_195\n\nSCOK_+25%\n\nSCOK_-25%\n\nReference Model\n\nOK_195\n\nSCOK_+25%\n\nSCOK_-25%\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nG\nra\n\nd\ne \n\n(%\n)\n\nG\nra\n\nd\ne \n\n(%\n)\n\nEast (meters)\n\nNorth (meters)\n\n1000\n\n900\n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n0.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 6.00\n\nOK_195\n\nSCOK_+25%\n\nSCOK_-25%\n\nOK_195\n\nSCOK_+25%\n\nSCOK_-25%\n\nCutoff (%)Cutoff (%)\n\nTo\nta\n\nl N\nu\n\nm\nb\n\ner\n o\n\nf \nB\n\nlo\nck\n\ns \nM\n\nis\ncl\n\nas\nsi\n\nn\ned\n\nN\nu\n\nm\nb\n\ner\n o\n\nf \nW\n\nas\nte\n\n B\nlo\n\nck\ns \n\nC\nla\n\nss\nin\n\ned\n a\n\ns \nW\n\nas\nte\n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n0.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 6.00\n\nOK_195\n\nSCOK_+25%\n\nSCOK_-25%\n\nCutoff (%)\n\nN\nu\n\nm\nb\n\ner\n o\n\nf \nW\n\nas\nte\n\n B\nlo\n\nck\ns \n\nC\nla\n\nss\nin\n\ned\n a\n\ns \nO\n\nre\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c)\n\n\n\n227\n\nCristina Paix\u00e3o Ara\u00fajo and Jo\u00e3o Felipe Coimbra Leite Costa\n\nREM: R.

This dissimilarity \nhas to be considered when integrating \nthe two sources of information. In the \nstudy reported here, two methodologies, \nnamely, ordinary kriging and ordinary \ncokriging, were used to incorporate data \nof different quality. \n\nFor samples with bias and precision \nerror, ordinary kriging led to poor results \nstrongly affected by sample bias. In the \ncase of ordinary kriging, the best option \nwas to use only those samples that were ac-\ncurate and precise, discarding biased data.\n\nOrdinary cokriging produced good \n\nresults, since the poor-quality samples \nwere considered secondary information \nand their mean was filtered (standard-\nized values). The results of the estimates \nwere less smooth than those obtained \nwith ordinary kriging, which led to esti-\nmates closer to the true block grades. In \na comparison of ordinary kriging using \nonly data that were accurate and precise \n(but few in number), ordinary cokriging \ncombining biased and imprecise data, and \nordinary standardized cokriging, the latter \nis favored. \n\nUsing the grade block model result-\ning from standardized cokriging led to \ngrade tonnage curves and swath plots \n\nsimilar to those derived from the refer-\nence block grade model. The use of this \nmethodology also drastically reduced the \nnumber of blocks misclassified.\n\nEven with less precise and biased \nsamples, improvements in block grade \nestimates, mining recovery, and block \nmisclassification were achieved, since \nan appropriate methodology was used \nto include this source of data. Cokriging \nprovided better estimates of recoverable \nresources at local and global scales, even \nwhen poor-quality samples were used (as \nsecondary data). Bias and imprecision in \nthe secondary data were not transferred \nto the estimates.\n\n5.
