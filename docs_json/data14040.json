Wistar rats.\n\nENGLISH VERSION\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe maximal lactate steady state (MLSS) is considered the gold\nstandard method for determination of aerobic /anaerobic metabo-\nlic transition during continuous exercise, but the blood lactate re-\nsponse at this intensity is ergometer-dependent in human beings.\nAn important tool for exercise physiology and correlated fields is\nthe use of animal models. However, investigation on evaluation\nprotocols in rats is scarce. The aim of the present study was to\nverify if the MLSS is ergometer-dependent for the evaluation of\nthe aerobic conditioning of rats. Therefore, 40 adult male Wistar\nrats were evaluated in two different exercise types: swimming and\ntreadmill running. In both, the MLSS was obtained with 4 conti-\nnuous 25 minutes tests, at different intensities, performed at 48\nhours intervals. In all tests, blood samples were collected from a\ncut at the tail tip every 5 minutes for blood lactate analysis. The\nswimming tests occurred in a deep cylindrical tank, with water\ntemperature at 31 \u00b1 1\u00b0C. The loads used in the tests were 4.5; 5.0;\n5.5 and 6.0% of the body weight tied to the animal\u2019s back. For\nMLSS determination in running exercise, there was selection of\nrunning rats and velocities used in the tests were 15, 20, 25, 30\nm.min-1. The MLSS was interpreted as an increase not exceeding\n1.0 mM of blood lactate, from the 10th to the 25th minute of exer-\ncise. The MLSS in swimming exercise occurred at 5.0% of body\nweight (bw), with blood lactate at 5.20 \u00b1 0.22 mM. The running\nrats presented MLSS at the 20 m.min-1 velocity, with blood lactate\nof 3.87 \u00b1 0.33 mM. The results indicated that the MLSS is ergom-\neter-dependent in experimental models using animals, as it is in\nhuman beings.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe determination of the metabolic predominance for the ener-\ngy supply during an exercise presents extreme importance for the\ncorrect prescription of an activity. Accordingly, there are many pro-\nposed evaluation protocols in order to detect the intensity of tran-\nsition between the aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms (Wasser-\nman and McIloroy, 1964; Monod and Scherrer, 1965; Kinderman et\nal., 1979; Sj\u00f6din and Jacobs, 1981; Chassain, 1986 and Tegtbur et\nal., 1993).\n\nExercise physiology and correlated fields have been developing\nsimple and complex methodologies over the years, with the pur-\npose to determine the effort intensity. According to Gaesser and\nPoole (1996), the physiological responses facing the exercise trust-\nfully signal the characteristic of the predominant metabolism of\nthe energy supply for the given activity. Among these responses it\nis possible to highlight the blood lactacidemia.\n\nThe maximal lactate steady state (MLSS), defined as the high-\nest intensity in which the anaerobic metabolism still predominates\nover the aerobic, is currently considered the gold standard method\nfor the determination of the transition intensity between these\nmetabolisms in continuous exercise performed by humans (Beneke,\n1995; Beneke, 2003, Billat et al., 2003). According to Beneke et al.\n(1995), the lactacidemic response in this intensity is dependent on\nthe ergometer used by these individuals, which implies in careful\ngeneralizations of mistaken information on the training loads pre-\nscribed by the concentration of blood lactate.\n\nThe importance to precisely determine the exercise intensity is\nnot restricted to works in which humans are objects of the study.\nA tool that has been considered interesting to the organism obser-\nvation facing effort is the use of experimental models with ani-\nmals. Such models have been elaborated in order to simulate phys-\niopathological or training-related situations occurred with humans,\nand solve occasional problems derived from the observed alter-\nations (Oliveira et al., 2005; Braga et al., 2004; Murdes et al., 2004).\n\nWith this aim, Gobatto et al. (2001) evaluated the MLSS in sed-\nentary rats adapted to the aquatic environment, submitted to the\nswimming exercise, as proposed by Heck et al. (1985) for evalua-\ntion in humans. Thereby, the animals performed 20 minutes of\ncontinuous effort in intensities correspondent to 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and\n10% of their body weight attached to their bodies, with blood sam-\nples collection being conducted at every five minutes for later lac-\ntacidemia determination. The authors observed MLSS in intensi-\nties correspondent to 6% of the body weight, with stabilization\nconcentration of 5,5 mM. This index is different and higher than\nthe one reported for humans in distinct exercises and for rats per-\nforming effort in rolling treadmill (approximately 4 mM). In a recent\nreview on the maximal lactate steady state, Billat et al. (2003) point\nout the findings by Gobatto et al. (2001) as representative for the\nstudy with animals.\n\nOther evaluation protocols have been developed in swimming,\nsuch as the determination of the critical load and anaerobic work\nability (Marangon et al., 2002) and minimal lactate test (Voltarelli et\nal., 2002). However, due to its great importance, all of them use\nthe MSLL as gold Standard in order to validate their procedures.\n\nThe rolling treadmill is another ergometer widely used for train-\ning in rats, and thereby, the detection of the effort intensity in run-\nning exercise is extremely important. In 1993, Pillis et al. proposed\nthe application of incremental test and observation of the lactaci-\ndemic response for aerobic evaluation of runner rats, based on the\nanaerobic thresholds concepts (Lan) suggested for humans (Sjod-\nin and Jacobs, 1981). Therefore, the animals performed a test char-\nacterized by the progressive velocity increase, with five minute-\nstages and blood samples collection at the end of each load, with\nlater determination of the anaerobic threshold through exponential\nbehavior analysis of the lactacidemic curve. The rats\u2019 anaerobic\nthreshold was obtained at 25 m.min-1, in a lactate concentration of\n4 mM. The results of this study revealed blood lactate behavior\n\n\n\n234e Rev Bras Med Esporte _ Vol. 12, N\u00ba 5 \u2013 Set/Out, 2006\n\nsimilar to the one described for humans, with the same concentra-\ntion associated with the Lan, indeed. However, in the rats swim-\nming, Gobatto et al. (1991) did not find this classic exponential\nbehavior of the blood lactate curve, which suggests the need of\nfurther investigation on the lactate kinetic in animals submitted to\nphysical exercise and the lactate responses distinction in different\nergometers.\n\nThe aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the max-\nimal lactate steady state is dependent on the ergometer used for\nthe aerobic evaluation in rats, as it is for humans, due to this meth-\nod\u2019s importance and also for prevention of mistakes in the pre-\nscription of activity for animals in different kinds of exercise.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nAnimals\n\nAll experiments were conducted according to the American\nCollege of Sports Medicine politics and approved by the Biosciences\nInstitute of the S\u00e3o Paulo State University \u2013 UNESP, Rio Claro.\nForty-four Wistar rats, with 90 days of age, weighting 443 \u00b1 33 g,\nwere used. During the experimental period, the animals were kept\nin collective cages (five rats per cage) in a lighted room with light-\ndark cycle of 12:00-12:00 hs and temperature of 25\u00b0C. The rats\nreceived commercial food specific for rodents (Labina-Purina) and\nwater ad libitum.\n\nExperimental protocol\n\nAdaptation to the water environment\n\nTwenty animals were submitted to maximal lactate steady state\ntests in swimming exercise. The rats were adapted to the water\nenvironment in a standardized manner prior to the tests conduc-\ntion. The adaptation occurred in a total period of 15 uninterrupted\ndays, in a cylindrical tank with smooth surface, measuring 60 cm\nof diameter by 120 cm of depth (Marangon et al., 2001), with wa-\nter temperature kept at 31 \u00b1 1\u00b0C (Harri and Kuusela, 1986). The\npurpose of the adaptation was to decrease the animal\u2019s stress with-\nout promoting physiological adaptations derived from the physical\ntraining, though.\n\nInitially, the rats were inserted in shallow water for three days\nduring 15 minutes. Later, the water level was increased, as well as\nthe effort duration time and the load to be held by the animal. Thus,\non the forth day, the rats swam in deep water for two minutes,\nwith increase of two minutes at each day until the tenth day of\nadaptation. On the eleventh day, the animals were submitted to\nthe swimming exercise for five minutes holding a load of 3% of\ntheir body weight, with increase of five minutes at each day, when,\non the fifteenth day, the adaptation ceased.\n\nSelection of the runner rats and adaptation to the treadmill\n\nIt was necessary to previously select the runner animals in or-\nder to conduct the tests in treadmill. The selection occurred in a\nseven day-period, in which the 20 rats that presented positive re-\nsponse to the running stimulus at least five times were chosen\nAfter the selection, the animals were submitted to an adaptation\nto the treadmill exercise, with progressive velocities (5 to 20 m.min-\n1) and duration (5 to 15 min). The aim of the adaptation was also\nthe reduction of stress indices presented by the animal due to the\ntask being known without physical training promotion.\n\nDetermination of the maximal lactate steady state\n\nThe whole experimental protocol was conducted in environmen-\ntal conditions identical to the ones during the adaptation period,\nboth in swimming and in treadmill running.\n\nIn both exercises, the protocol for the MLSS determination con-\nsisted of five continuous tests with duration of 25 minutes, in dif-\nferent effort intensities, randomly distributed and separated by a\n\n48-hour resting interval. In all tests there was blood collection of\nthe animals\u2018 tails in the resting times, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 minutes\nof exercise, for later blood lactate analysis and the lactacidemic\ncurves in each intensity.\n\nSwimming tests\n\nThe rats performed 25 minutes of continuous effort in loads\nequivalent to 4,5; 5,0; 5,5 and 6,0% of their body weight, attached\nto their backs. There was daily load adjustment, with the animals\u2018\nbody mass measurement. Blood samples from the animals\u2018 tails\nwere performed for each intensity in the times previously described,\nand the blood sample\u2019s treatment occurred according to a tech-\nnique detailed below.\n\nTreadmill running tests\n\nFor the MLSS evaluation in running, the selected animals per-\nformed the continuous tests in the 15, 20, 25 and 30 m.min-1 ve-\nlocities. The treadmill specific for training with rats composed of\neight lanes, was kept with the electric shock off, reducing hence,\nthe stress effect in the effort conducted by the animal. Blood sam-\nples were removed from the rats\u2018 tails as in swimming.\n\nBlood samples and analysis\n\nDuring the continuous tests, blood samples (25 \u00b5l) were removed\nfrom the animal\u2019s tail in the times already described and placed in\nEppendorf tubes (capacity of 1,5 ml), containing 50 \u00b5l of sodium\nfluoride (1%). In order to avoid the blood dilution in water in the\ncase of the swimmers, the animals were removed from the cylin-\nder and dried, returning to the aquatic environment immediately\nafter the blood collection. The blood lactate concentrations were\ndetermined in a lactate analyzer (Model YSI 1500 Sport, Yellow\nSprings, OH, EUA).\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nIn both ergometers the MLSS was interpreted as the highest\nexercise intensity in which the increase of the lactacidemia was\nequal or lower than 1 mM, from the 10th to the 25th minute. The\naverage concentrations of blood lactate in each intensity for the\ntwo ergometers were obtained through the ratio of the lactaci-\ndemic indices of the times 10, 15, 20 and 25 minutes of exercise.\nA one-way ANOVA was used in order to identify the differences\nbetween the blood lactate concentrations in the several durations\nof the continuous exercise and between distinct ergometers: swim-\nming and treadmill running. The results are expressed in average\n\u00b1 standard error of the average. In all statistical procedures, the\nsignificance index was preset in P &lt;0,05 (Dawson-Saunders and\nTrapp, 1994).\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe blood lactate curves of the rats submitted to the swimming\nexercise are expressed in figure 1. The MLSS was observed in the\nintensity equivalent to 5% of the body weight, in an average lac-\ntate concentration of 5,20 \u00b1 0,22 mM.\n\nIn the running exercise, the velocity correspondent to the max-\nimal lactate steady state was 20 m.min-1, in lactate concentration\nof 3,87 \u00b1 0,33 mM, though (figure 1). In the intensity equivalent to\n30 m.min-1 only 20% of the animals completed the test.\n\nThe one-way ANOVA identified significant difference between\nthe maximal lactate steady state obtained in the swimming exer-\ncise and the treadmill running.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nAlthough the lactate production occurs internally in the skeletal\nmuscle, the blood measurements of this metabolite during exer-\ncise provide precise information about the energetic supply for the\n\n\n\nRev Bras Med Esporte _ Vol. 12, N\u00ba 5 \u2013 Set/Out, 2006 235e\n\nificity of the water tank used. In the present work, it was chosen to\nperform the swimming exercise in a deep tank (60 cm of diameter\nby 120 cm of depth) with a smooth surface, avoiding thus, that the\nanimals could lean on the sides of the tank during the test or could\ntouch the bottom of the tank performing a jump movement. In the\nstudy by Gobatto et al. (2001), the tanks used were not deep (100\ncm of diameter by 80 cm of depth), which possibly favored the\nrats\u2018 activity.\n\nThe stabilization concentration of the lactate in the maximal aer-\nobic intensity in swimming was 5,20 \u00b1 0,22 mM, an index very\nclose to the one described by Gobatto et al. (2001) for sedentary\nrats (5,5 mM), which suggests reproducibility of this concentration\nfor the species of evaluated animals. Even after aerobic training,\nGobatto et al. (2001) did not observe alteration in the lactate stabi-\nlization concentration. In humans, the lactate stabilization in maxi-\nmal aerobic intensity is usually found between 3 and 7 mM (Steg-\nmann et al., 1981; Harnish et al., 2000), however, in swimming\nexercise, this index seems to be close to the lower threshold of\nthe described group. Pereira et al. (2002) determined the anaero-\nbic threshold of swimming athletes in progressive test and ob-\nserved inflexion of the lactacidemic curve in 3,5 mM concentra-\ntion. Thus, it seems that Wistar rats present higher lactate\nconcentration indices in the MLSS in swimming exercise when\ncompared to humans.\n\nIn the treadmill running we obtained MLSS in 20 m.min-1 intensi-\nty in 3,87 \u00b1 0,33 mM concentration. Pillis et al. (1993) and Langfort\net al. (1996) suggest the occurrence of the anaerobic threshold in\nrunner rats in the 25 m.min-1 velocity, which is higher than in our\nfindings. In the present study, the animals were submitted to 25\nminutes of continuous exercise in the 15, 20, 25 and 30 m.min-1\n\nvelocities, allowing a longer observation of the blood lactate kinet-\nic, while those authors only observed the lactate behavior related\nto progressive exercise.\n\nConcerning the lactate concentration, the treadmill exercise pro-\nmoted stabilization in an index significantly lower to the one ob-\nserved in swimming (figures 1 and 2). The lactacidemic concentra-\ntion verified in the present study is similar to the point of inflexion\nof the lactate curve described by Pillis et al. (1993) (4 mM) and to\nthe index obtained in a classic study performed with humans in\nthis kind of exercise (Heck et al., 1985). There are no works in the\nliterature which present aerobic training results in running in max-\nimal lactate steady state with Wistar rats, as the one conducted by\nGobatto et al. (2001) in swimming.\n\nOur results clearly demonstrate the ergometer dependence of\nthe maximal lactate steady state protocol in exercises for Wistar\nrats, as well as in humans. Such fact demands caution in the eval-\nuation and prescription of physical training for these animals. Fur-\nther studies should be conducted with rats in different physiopatho-\nlogical and training conditions in order to identify possible alterations\nin the evaluated aerobic parameter.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis study was supported by the Foundation of Research Support of the\nS\u00e3o Paulo State (FAPESP \u2013 Proc. 07070-5/2004) and the Research Centers\nCAPES and CNPq (Proc. 300270/2004-16).

Such fact implies in the use of this parameter as a prescrip-\ntion instrument (Mujika et al., 1995) and sports training aid (Pyne\net al., 2001).\n\nThe maximal lactate steady state is related to the biochemical\nbalance between appearance and removal of the blood lactate\n(Mader and Heck, 1986) and is considered the highest exercise\nintensity in which this steady state still occurs, outlining hence, a\ntransition of aerobic-anaerobic metabolic predominance (Beneke,\n1995; Billat et al., 2003). Therefore, it is considered a safe method\nfor aerobic ability identification (Jones and Carter, 2000), which\ncorroborates so that many studies use this procedure in the evalu-\nation of active individuals and high performance athletes (Jones\nand Doust, 1998; Harnish et al., 2001; Beneke, 2003).\n\nOur study is important due to the application of this individual\nprotocol in order to evaluate laboratory animals in two different\nkinds of exercise: swimming and treadmill running.

(2001) and Voltarelli et al. (2002). The blood\nlactate stabilization for our sedentary rats was obtained in 5% of\nthe body weight, as described by Voltarelli et al. (2002). Gobatto et\nal.
