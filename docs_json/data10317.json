To achieve this objective, ethanolic extracts of the wet biomass (70.0%, w/w) of two \n\nmicroalgal strains (Nannochloropsis oculata and Phaeodactylum tricornutum) were prepared \n\nand partitioned into three fractions, namely hexane, colloidal and water fractions, using a binary \n\nsolvent mixture (hexane + water), employing a new process called as Liquid Tri-phase System \n\n(LTPS). HPLC-ELSD was used to analyse the lipid classes and GC-MS to assess the fatty acid \n\nprofiles. N. oculata had an ethanolic extract yield of 38.2% (w/w, dry weight) and P. \n\ntricornutum of 30.3%. Lipid class distribution (% w/w, total lipids) of N. oculata was 45.1, 22.1 \n\nand 32.8 for neutral lipids, glycolipids and phospholipids, respectively; and for P. tricornutum \n\nit was 23.2, 49.1 and 27.7, respectively. When the LTPS process was applied, lipid distribution \n\nwas: hexane (27.4%), colloidal (53.4%) and water (19.2%) for N. oculata; and 30.6, 55.4, and \n\n14.0% for P. tricornutum. The colloidal phases in both strains contain more than 23.0% \n\nglycolipids and 68.0% phospholipids. HPLC-ELSD confirmed that the neutral lipids fraction \n\nwas obtained free of glycolipids and phospholipids. The fatty acids composition showed that \n\nthe neutral lipids fraction or hexane phase of the LTPS is suitable for biodiesel production as it \n\ncontains more than 83.0% of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, which are less prone \n\nto oxidation compared to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Additionally, a colloidal phase \n\nfraction rich in glycolipids, that can be converted into biosurfactants, and phospholipids that \n\ncan be processed as liposomes, aquaculture feed or infant formula additives as it is enriched in \n\neicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or other long chain poly unsaturated fatty acids, was obtained. \n\n \n\nKey words: Microalgae, wet biomass extraction, liquid tri-phase system, lipid classes, \n\nbiodiesel, bio-refinery \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\niv \n \n\nRESUMO \n\n \n\nFactores associados aos combust\u00edveis f\u00f3sseis como os fortes impactos ambientais, incerteza de \n\naprovisionamento energ\u00e9tico e ainda necessidade de reduzir o consumo de energia, t\u00eam levado \n\na uma procura por substitutos vi\u00e1veis das energias n\u00e3o-renov\u00e1veis. Os biocombust\u00edveis devido \n\n\u00e0s semelhan\u00e7as com os combust\u00edveis convencionais, apresentam-se como potenciais candidatos \n\npara a substitui\u00e7\u00e3o do diesel derivado do petr\u00f3leo por fontes renov\u00e1veis. \n\nOs biocombust\u00edveis designados de primeira gera\u00e7\u00e3o foram produzidos a partir de produtos \n\nagr\u00edcolas, contudo a concorr\u00eancia com a industria alimentar aliada \u00e0 necessidade de terra ar\u00e1vel \n\ne \u00e1gua pot\u00e1vel institu\u00edram fortes barreiras aos seu sucesso.  \n\nA segunda gera\u00e7\u00e3o de biocombust\u00edveis usou como mat\u00e9ria-prima res\u00edduos agr\u00edcolas \n\nnomeadamente culturas lignocelulosicas em vez dos produtos alimentares. No entanto, a \n\ntecnologia utilizada n\u00e3o se apresentou comercialmente rent\u00e1vel para uma explora\u00e7\u00e3o comercial. \n\nNo processo de optimiza\u00e7\u00e3o, quatro tecnologias distintas foram usadas para a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ncombust\u00edveis l\u00edquidos tendo por base lignoceluloses. O primeiro sistema baseia-se no processo \n\nde gaseifica\u00e7\u00e3o para a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de g\u00e1s de s\u00edntese, seguida por Fischer-Tropsch ou s\u00edntese de \n\nmetanol para produzir alcanos ou metanol respectivamente. A segunda tecnologia empregou \n\npir\u00f3lise e liquefac\u00e7\u00e3o termoqu\u00edmica de bio-\u00f3leos para produzir alcanos. Estes compostos al\u00e9m \n\nde apresentarem um pre\u00e7o elevado, a moderniza\u00e7\u00e3o do processo requer altas press\u00f5es de Azoto \n\n(H2). O terceiro m\u00e9todo baseou-se na hidr\u00f3lise da lignocelulose para a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de mon\u00f3meros \n\nde a\u00e7\u00facar, os quais foram ainda convertidos em etanol e/ou hidrocarbonetos arom\u00e1ticos por \n\nmeio de fermenta\u00e7\u00e3o e/ou desidrata\u00e7\u00e3o. Por\u00e9m, o processo de gaseifica\u00e7\u00e3o necessita de ser \n\nlevada a cabo a uma temperatura de 1000\u00b0 C, o que representa um elevado gasto energ\u00e9tico e \n\nmonet\u00e1rio. O quarto m\u00e9todo inclui o hidro-tratamento e desoxigena\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00f3leos vegetais. Os \n\nm\u00e9todos descritos apresentam-se como uma tecnologia complexa e de elevado custo de \n\nmanuten\u00e7\u00e3o, sendo fundamental aprofundar os estudos relacionados com as convers\u00f5es \n\nt\u00e9rmicas da biomassa para biocombust\u00edveis, bem como a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o dos m\u00e9todos descritos \n\nem larga escala. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\nv \n \n\n \n\nEstes factores levaram ao aparecimento da terceira gera\u00e7\u00e3o de biocombust\u00edveis, produzidos a \n\npartir de microalgas. Esta fonte, \u00e9 considerada promissora, visto que det\u00e9m uma elevada \n\nprodutividade lip\u00eddica ao longo de todo o ano, n\u00e3o necessitando de terra ar\u00e1vel nem \u00e1gua \n\npot\u00e1vel e n\u00e3o entrando em competi\u00e7\u00e3o direta com a ind\u00fastria alimentar. Contudo a sua \n\nutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 condicionada pela falta de tecnologias para aplica\u00e7\u00e3o em escala industrial e no \n\nelevado pre\u00e7o de processamento, sendo a desidrata\u00e7\u00e3o da biomassa o passo de maior consumo \n\nenerg\u00e9tico e o que acarreta os maiores custos de todo o processo. \n\nCom base nas limita\u00e7\u00f5es apresentadas para os biocombust\u00edveis de terceira gera\u00e7\u00e3o,  este \n\ntrabalho tem como principal objectivo obter a partir de  biomassa de microalgas uma fra\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nlip\u00eddica, livre tanto de fosfolip\u00eddos como de glicol\u00edpidos, para posterior produ\u00e7\u00e3o de biodiesel. \n\nAs frac\u00e7\u00f5es obtidas e ricas em fosfol\u00edpidos ou glicol\u00edpidos ser\u00e3o ainda analisadas pela sua \n\nposs\u00edvel aplica\u00e7\u00e3o na \u00e1rea biom\u00e9dica ou alimentar sobre um esquema de bio-refinaria. \n\nPara este trabalho o etanol foi usado para extrair l\u00edpidos neutros dos polares da biomassa h\u00famida \n\nde microalga (70.0% w/w), e com isto, possibilitar o uso exclusivo de l\u00edpidos neutros para a \n\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o do biodiesel, com vista a aumentar tanto a qualidade como o rendimento do processo. \n\nOs l\u00edpidos polares obtidos s\u00e3o ainda considerados produtos de valor acrescentado, classificados \n\ncomo \u00e1cidos gordos de cadeia longa poli-insaturados e altamente propensos a instabilidade \n\noxidativa. \n\nComo resultado, os extractos brutos de l\u00edpidos foram divididos em tr\u00eas classes,  por \n\ncromatografia em coluna de s\u00edlica-gel em sistema trif\u00e1sico. Com o uso de clorof\u00f3rmio, acetona \n\ne metanol foi poss\u00edvel separar lip\u00eddios neutros (NLs), glicol\u00edpidos (GLs) e fosfol\u00edpidos (PLs) \n\npara cada tipo de solvente, respectivamente. No entanto estes solventes org\u00e2nicos, classificados \n\ncomo cancer\u00edgenos n\u00e3o podem ser utilizados na industria alimentar. Foi assim, aplicado um \n\nsistema de fase bin\u00e1ria, utilizando hexano e \u00e1gua com o objectivo de obter as tr\u00eas principais \n\nclasses de l\u00edpidos. Tr\u00eas fases foram observadas depois da mistura, a fase superior de hexano, a \n\nfase coloidal e a fase aquosa inferior. A frac\u00e7\u00e3o coloidal foi deixada no papel de filtro enquanto \n\nque a fase correspondente ao hexano e \u00e1gua foi filtrada, recolhida e posteriormente separada \n\nnum funil de separa\u00e7\u00e3o. Os perfis lip\u00eddicos foram analisados por HPLC-ELSD enquanto a \n\ncomposi\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1cidos gordos foi determinada por cromatogr\u00e1fica gasosa (GC-MS). \n\n\n\n  \n\nvi \n \n\nA esp\u00e9cie N. oculata apresentou o maior rendimento para o extracto etan\u00f3lico com 38.2% (w/w, \n\npeso seco), seguido pela P. tricornutum com 30.3%. A distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de l\u00edpidos por classe (%w/w, \n\nl\u00edpidos totais) de N. oculata foi de 45.1, 22.1 e 32.8 e para P. tricornutum de 23.2, 49.1 e 27.7 \n\npara l\u00edpidos neutros, glicol\u00edpidos e fosfol\u00edpidos, respectivamente. De modo semelhante, a \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o de l\u00edpidos no sistema-Tri em fase l\u00edquida foram hexano (27.4%), coloidal (53.4%) \n\ne \u00e1gua (19.2%) para N. oculata; e 30.6, 55.4, e 14.0% para P. tricornutum. A distribui\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nclasse coloidal em % (w/w, coloidal total) apresentou resultados de N. oculata (NLs = 2.7 \n\n(5.1%), GLs = 12.5 (23.4%), PLs = 38.2 (71.5%); e para P. tricornutum (NLs = 1.6 (3%), GLs \n\n= 15.9 (28.7%), PLs = 37.9 (68.3%). Por HPLC-ELSD foram confirmadas as diferentes classes \n\nde l\u00edpidos e a separa\u00e7\u00e3o dos NLs tanto de GLs como de PLs. \n\nTriacilglicerol (TAG), diacilglicerol (DAG), monoacilglicerol (MAG), GLs e PLs foram \n\ndetectados nos extractos brutos de microalgas e separados em 40 minutos, por um sistema \n\nquatern\u00e1rio de hexano, acetato de etilo, \u00e1gua e isopropanol. O elemento considerado menos \n\npolar, TAG, foi alu\u00eddo primeiro, seguido de DAG, FA e MAG, GLs e PLs. TAG apresentou-se \n\ncomo o l\u00edpido dominante tanto no extracto em bruto como na frac\u00e7\u00e3o de NLs. \n\nA composi\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1cidos gordos para as duas fases (hexano e coloidais) mostrou que os l\u00edpidos \n\nneutros apresentam-se como adequados para a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de biodiesel, com mais de 85.0% de \n\n\u00e1cidos gordos saturados e monoinsaturados que s\u00e3o menos propensos a instabilidade oxidativa.  \n\nOs glicol\u00edpidos podem ser convertidos para biossurfactantes enquanto que fosfol\u00edpidos podem \n\nser processados para lipossomas como sistema de entrega de drogas ou alimentos em \n\naquacultura. A frac\u00e7\u00e3o coloidal enriquecida em \u00e1cido eicosapentaen\u00f3ico (EPA) pode ser \n\noptimizada e usada no tratamento da aterosclerose, cancro, e doen\u00e7as neuro-degenerativas.  \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Microalgas, extra\u00e7\u00e3o lip\u00eddica, fra\u00e7\u00e3o lip\u00eddica, biodiesel, bio-refinaria \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\nvii \n \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\n \n\nCONTENTS                                                                                                                   PAGES \n\nDECLARATION OF AUTHORSHIP AND COPYRIGHT ...................................................... i \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ....................................................................................................... ii \n\nABSTRACT .............................................................................................................................. iii \n\nRESUMO .................................................................................................................................. iv \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS ......................................................................................................... vii \n\nFIGURE INDEX ....................................................................................................................... ix \n\nTABLE INDEX .......................................................................................................................... x \n\nSCHEME INDEX ..................................................................................................................... xi \n\nANNEX INDEX ...................................................................................................................... xii \n\nLIST OF ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS ................................................................ xiii \n\n1.

INTRODUCTION \n\n1.1. General Background  \n\nFossil fuels  are the world\u2019s primary energy consumption in the transportation sector (Houghton \n\net al., 2001), which are finite and, at current usage rates, are expected to  be depleted in this \n\ncentury, and thus not renewable in the short period (Akansu, Dulger, Kahraman, &amp; Veziro?lu, \n\n2004). They are the largest contributor for greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs);and in 2006 were \n\nassociated  with the emissions of 29 Giga tonnes of CO2 (Raupach et al., 2007). It is estimated \n\nthat natural processes remove only about 12 Giga tonnes, therefore, compatible mitigation \n\nstrategies are required to neutralise the excess CO2 (Raupach, et al., 2007). The 1997 Kyoto \n\nProtocol called for a 5.2% reduction in GHGs emissions worldwide (Houghton, et al., 2001).  \n\nBesides, the persistent hike in global prices of crude oil affects trade balance of oil importing \n\ncountries (Bol, Bhattacharya, &amp; Mishra, 2004). Subsequently, government regulations and full \n\nor partial tax exemption were established to promote the utilization of alternative fuels to fossil \n\nfuels (Ralf Gubler, 2007). In this regard, the EU has set a target that 10% of the total \n\ntransportation fuels will be of biofuels by 2020 (Pacini, Silveira, &amp; Da Silva Filho, 2013). \n\nPrediction shows coal, gas and oil will be the main used energy sources until 2050; but the \n\nenergy derived from biomass and other renewables  are expected to increase dramatically \n\n(Fig.1.1) (Shell, 2008). \n\n \n\n                           Fig. 1.1. Predicted world energy consumption by Shell (Shell, 2008) \n\n \n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050\n\nE\nJ \n\np\ne\nr \n\ny\ne\na\nr\n\nPrediction year\n\nOther Renewabels\n\nBiomass\n\nNuclear\n\nCoal\n\nGas\n\nOll\n\n\n\n  \n\n2 \n \n\nTherefore, the aforementioned issues were considered to be the important trigger for many \n\ninitiatives to search for  alternative sources of energy (Azam, Waris, &amp; Nahar, 2005). Amongst \n\nthese renewable energy sources, biofuels for instance biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethane, \n\nbiohydrogen and biobutanol received attention of which, biodiesel is a potential candidate for \n\na petro-diesel substitute. Biodiesel, is a mixture of fatty acid alkyl (methyl, ethyl, or propyl) \n\nesters, which are mainly generated from vegetable oil  or animal fat. Its production increased at \n\na faster rate across the world, at an average rate of 32% per year, between 2000 and 2005 (R \n\nGubler, 2006). Due to the similarities of physico-chemical properties with petroleum-based \n\ndiesel, biodiesel can be used in conventional diesel engines without significant modifications \n\n(Venendaal, J\u00f8rgensen, &amp; Foster, 1997). However, biodiesel is claimed to be instable towards \n\noxidation and has high viscosity. But, these properties depend on feedstock types and biomass \n\nto biofuel conversion procedures.  \n\nEnergy density, weight, and storage size are important characteristics for transportation fuels \n\n(US DOE,2007; US EIA,2013). For example, hydrogen presents the highest specific energy \n\n(Fig.1.2). However, vehicles must carry their fuel supply so, to determine which fuel is best \n\nfor motor vehicles, energy density of the fuel is important.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 1.2. Energy density of various transportation fuels (US DOE,2007; US EIA,2013) \n\nHydrogen, because it is so light, requires 15.9 times the container volume to provide the same \n\nenergy as diesel (US DOE,2007; US EIA,2013). Hence, its energy density is so small that using \n\nhydrogen as transportation fuel for heavy-duty trucks is expensive and impractical. Biodiesel \n\nand diesel are similar with respect to energy density (US DOE,2007; US EIA,2013).  \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\nE\nn\ne\nrg\n\ny\n c\n\no\nn\nte\n\nn\nt\n\nSpecific energy(KJ/g)\n\nEnergy density(KWH/gal)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethyl_group\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propyl\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_oil\n\n\n  \n\n3 \n \n\nIn general, biofuels have the following socio-economic and environmental advantages over \n\nfossil fuels: \n\n? In most case they are carbon-neutral (Daroch, Geng, &amp; Wang, 2013).  \n\n? Biofuel industry creates huge jobs. For example, if oil industry creates jobs for one \n\nperson, coal creates 4 and ethanol creates 152 (De Castro, 2007).  \n\n? Emissions from biofuels are less toxic (Daroch, et al., 2013).  \n\n? Biofuel improves trade balance. In Brazil, for instance, the replacement of gasoline by \n\nbio-ethanol saved US$ 1.8 billion/year (Dufey, Vermeulen, &amp; Vorley, 2007). \n\n? It is also renewable (vegetable oils, animal fats and waste cooking oils, etc.) (Agarwal \n\n&amp; Das, 2001; Kalligeros et al., 2003).  \n\nHence, consideration of these advantages leads to evolution of biofuel generations from \n\ndifferent renewable resources like vegetable-based oils, sugar cane, corn, lignocellulosic and \n\nmicroalgal biomass (Fig.1.3).  \n\nFood crops                           Lignocelluloses                        Microalgae \n\n  Fig. 1.3. Biomass sources for biofuel production \n\n Sources of Feedstocks \n\nFirst Generation \n\nThe first generation biofuels mainly biodiesel have been mainly generated from food and oil \n\ncrops .But, competition with food and fibre production for arable land, fresh water and fertiliser \n\nrequirement are barriers to their success (Group &amp; Management, 2009; Koh &amp; Wilcove, 2008). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n4 \n \n\nSecond Generation \n\nThe  second generation biofuels are from lignocelluloses to produce particularly alkanes, \n\ngasoline and diesel fuels from the whole plant matter like agricultural residues rather than food \n\ncrops (Koh &amp; Wilcove, 2008; Moore, 2008). However, technology for conversion has not \n\nreached the scale required for commercial exploitation (Koh &amp; Wilcove, 2008).  \n\nThird Generation \n\nThird generation biofuels are produced from microalgal biomass. Algae are primitive organism \n\nlacking roots, stems and leaves, but have chlorophyll \u2018a\u2019 as their primary photosynthetic \n\npigment (Nisbett, Peng, Choi, &amp; Norenzayan, 2001). Prokaryotic cells (cyanobacteria) lack \n\nmembrane-bound organelles (plastids, mitochondria, nuclei, Golgi bodies, and flagella) and are \n\nmore akin to bacteria than algae. Eukaryotic cells, which comprise of many different types of \n\ncommon algae, do have these organelles that control the functions of the cell, allowing it to \n\nsurvive and reproduce. The most important classes of Eukaryotes are: green algae \n\n(Chlorophyta), red algae (Rhodophyta) and diatoms (Bacillariophyta) (Khan, Hussain, Prasad, \n\n&amp; Banerjee, 2009).  \n\nAlgae can grow autotrophic- or heterotrophically; the former require only inorganic compounds \n\nsuch as CO2, salts and a light energy source for growth, while the latter require an external \n\nsource of organic compounds, as well as nutrients, as an energy source. Some photosynthetic \n\nalgae are mixotrophic, i.e. they have the ability to both perform photosynthesis and acquire \n\nexogenous organic nutrients (Brennan &amp; Owende, 2010). For autotrophic processes, \n\nphotosynthesis is a key component, whereby microalgae convert solar radiation and CO2 \n\nabsorbed by chloroplasts into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) the usable energy currency at \n\ncellular level, which is used in respiration to produce energy to support growth (Zilinskas &amp; \n\nZilinskas, 1974). \n\nMicroalgae Biomass Production \n\nTo optimize microalgal biomass production raceways open ponds and closed photobioreactor \n\nhave been developed (Fig.1.4). Raceways and open ponds are usually built in concrete, but \n\ncompacted earth lined ponds with white plastic have also been used. Closed photobioreactor \n\nsystems include the tubular, flat panel, and column (Brennan &amp; Owende, 2010).  \n\n\n\n  \n\n5 \n \n\nOpen systems are relatively cheaper but have poor biomass productivity. Closed systems yield \n\nhigh biomass but are expensive. These area needs further work to search for an ideal method of \n\nbiomass production for industrial scale application. \n\n           \n\n          Fig.1.4. Photo of open system - raceway (left) and closed system-tubular       \n\nphotobioreactor (right) \n\nBiomass Harvesting \n\nThe harvesting of microalgal biomass which generally requires one or more solid\u2013liquid \n\nseparation steps is a challenging phase of the algal biomass production process, and usually \n\naccounts for 20\u201330% of the total costs of production (Brennan &amp; Owende, 2010). Filtration, \n\nflocculation (Fig.1.5) and centrifugations are the most commonly used harvesting technologies. \n\n    \n\nFig. 1.5. Harvesting of microalgae biomass by flocculation \n\nLipid Content \n\nWhile many microalgae strain naturally have high lipid content (ca. 20\u201350% dry weight), it is \n\npossible to increase the concentration and modulate the lipid profile by optimising the growth \n\ndetermining factors.  \n\n\n\n  \n\n6 \n \n\nFor instance, Nannochloropsis strain was shown to have 68.5% lipid content after nitrogen \n\ndeprivation (Bondioli et al., 2012). Lipid content of N. oculata increased from 30.8% to 50.4% \n\nupon  2% CO2 aeration (Chiu et al., 2009).  \n\nLipid production increased by 14.9% with increasing temperature from 20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (Converti, \n\nCasazza, Ortiz, Perego, &amp; Del Borghi, 2009). UV-A application increases saturated FAs to \n\nPUFAs ratio (Forj\u00e1n et al., 2011). Similarly, P. tricornutum TAG levels increased from 69 to \n\n75% in nitrogen limitation (Hu et al., 2008). The decrease from 25\u00b0C to 10\u00b0C for 12h leads to \n\nhighest yields of PUFAs and EPA in  P. tricornutum (Jiang &amp; Gao, 2004). \n\nAdvantages of using Microalgae \n\nMicroalgae biomass is considered a better feedstock for biofuel and/or other value added \n\nproducts because microalgae \n\n? Oil productivity exceeds the yield of the best oilseed crops. For instance, biodiesel yield \n\nis of 12,000 Lha-1 for microalgae compared with 1190 Lha-1 for rapeseed (Schenk et \n\nal., 2008);  \n\n? Needs less water than terrestrial crops (Dismukes, Carrieri, Bennette, Ananyev, &amp; \n\nPosewitz, 2008);  \n\n? Can be cultivated in brackish water or sea water  and  on non-arable land (Searchinger \n\net al., 2008); \n\n? Have a rapid growth potential , the exponential growth rates can double their biomass \n\nin periods as short as 3.5 h  (Metting Jr, 1996);  \n\n? Biomass production can fixate high amount of CO2 (1 kg of dry algal biomass /1.83 kg \n\nof CO2) (Chisti, 2007); \n\n? Nutrients for cultivation(especially nitrogen  and phosphorous) can be obtained from \n\nwastewater, therefore, apart from providing growth medium, there is a dual potential \n\nfor treatment of wastewaters  (Cantrell, Ducey, Ro, &amp; Hunt, 2008);  \n\n? Cultivation does not require herbicides or pesticides (Rodolfi et al., 2009);  \n\n? Produce valuable co-products such as proteins , ?-carotene, and residual biomass after \n\noil extraction (Brennan &amp; Owende, 2010; Spolaore, Joannis-Cassan, Duran, &amp; \n\nIsambert, 2006);  \n\n? Oil yield may be enhanced under nitrogen deficiency or high light intensity (Qin, 2005).  \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n7 \n \n\nBio-refinery \n\nAmong the factors that affect the cost of biofuels from microalgae is biomass to biofuel \n\nconversion technologies (Brennan &amp; Owende, 2010).One approach to make it an economically \n\ncompetitive feedstock is to apply the bio-refinery concept (Fig.1.6).  \n\nThe bio-refinery concept embraces a whole crop approach of biomass conversion pathways \n\nleading to a whole portfolio of valuable products, drawing direct similarities to today\u2019s \n\npetroleum refineries, in which multiple fuels, basic chemicals, intermediate products and \n\nsophisticated products are produced from petroleum (Cherubini, 2010; Morais &amp; Bogel-\n\nLukasik, 2013). \n\nThe most important energy products that can be produced in biorefineries are:  \n\n? Gaseous biofuels (biogas, syngas hydrogen,and biomethane)  \n\n? Solid biofuels (biochar)  \n\n? Liquid biofuels (bioethanol, biodiesel, Fischer-Tropsch fuels, and bio-oil) \n\nSome of material products are \n\n? Biochemicals (fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals, building blocks, and bulk chemicals) \n\n? Organic acids (succinic, lactic, itaconic, fumaric and other sugar derivatives) \n\n \n\n                 Fig. 1.6. Microalgae and the biorefinery concept \n\n\n\n  \n\n8 \n \n\nMicroalgal Global Companies  \n\nThe world has been confronted with a food and energy crisis due to accelerated global \n\npopulation growth and the depletion of finite fossil fuel resources (Jacob-Lopes, Queiroz, \n\nRam\u00edrez-M\u00e9rida, &amp; Zepka, 2015). The increase in nutritional problems along with rising fuel \n\ndemands and environmental problems have increased the search for nutritional supplements \n\nand sustainable sources of energy.  \n\nMicroalgae have great potential in generating energy from biotechnological processes using \n\nrenewable sources and do not compromise food production. Microalgae have been of major \n\ninterest in biofuel production as well as in the feed, chemical and pharmaceutical sectors (Jacob-\n\nLopes, et al., 2015). Depending on the species and growth conditions, microalgae can be \n\nselected to produce a wide variety and abundance of lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and \n\nfeedstocks important for biofuel and production of nutraceuticals (Jacob-Lopes, et al., 2015). \n\nFor instance, Table 1.1 below shows different global companies engaged in algae with CO2 \n\nsequestering technology. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n9 \n \n\n    Table 1.1.

(2015) \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n10 \n \n\n1.2. Liquid Fuels from Biomass \n\nThe following are common types of processes for the production of liquid fuels from \n\nlignocelluloses or other biomasses (Fig.1.7) (Huber &amp; Dumesic, 2006). The first process \n\ninvolves gasification to produce syngas, followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to produce \n\nalkanes. The second employs pyrolysis and thermochemical liquefaction for bio-oils \n\nproduction, which are further refined to produce alkanes. The third relies on hydrolysis of \n\nlignocellulose for sugar monomer production, and is further converted into ethanol and/or \n\naromatic hydrocarbons through fermentation and/or dehydration. However, gasification was \n\ncarried out at 1000oC which is energy intensive. Pyrolysis and liquefaction are expensive as \n\nrefining or upgrading of  biooil requires high H2 pressure (Brennan &amp; Owende, 2010). Further \n\nstudy is required to achieve a better understanding of the economics of biomass thermal \n\nconversions for bio-fuel production, as well as resolving issues related to the capabilities of \n\nthese technologies in industrial application. \n\n \n\n    Fig. 1.7. Processes for production of liquid fuels from biomass (Huber &amp; Dumesic, 2006) \n\n1.3. Vegetable Oils to Green Diesel \n\nDespite the fact that most of the current biofuels are produced through a transesterification \n\nprocess, these fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) have high oxygen content, poor flow property \n\nat low temperatures and poor oxidative stability (Ma &amp; Hanna, 1999). To solve such problems, \n\ncatalytic cracking (Corma, Huber, Sauvanaud, &amp; O'connor, 2007), hydrotreating (Huber, \n\nO\u2019Connor, &amp; Corma, 2007),and deoxygenation (Sn\u00e5re, Kubickova, M\u00e4ki-Arvela, Er\u00e4nen, &amp; \n\nMurzin, 2006) have been attempted to produce green diesel. The claims of green diesel over \n\nbiodiesel are the following (Zhao, Br\u00fcck, &amp; Lercher, 2013): \n\nBiomass\n\nG\nas\n\nifi\nca\n\ntio\nn\n\nPyrolysis\n\nLiquefaction\n\nSyn gas\n\n(CO + H2)\n\nBiooils\n\nFermentation\n\nDehydration\n\nFischer-Tropsch\nAlkanes\n\nRefining\nLiquid fuels\n\nSugars\n\nAromatic\nhydrocarbons\n\nH\nydro\n\nlysis\n\nEthanol\n\n\n\n  \n\n11 \n \n\n1) Green diesel is sulphur free; 2) Its cetane number and calorific values are higher than \n\nbiodiesel and even petro-diesel; and 3) Improved cold filter plug point  \n\nHowever, the utilization of cracking method has several drawbacks. It contains large amount \n\nof oxygenated and aromatic compounds, whose use is strictly regulated in Europe. Most \n\nimportantly, zeolite cracking is a non-selective process that produces a wide range of \n\ncompounds and undesired coke formation (Corma, et al., 2007). The hydrotreating process is \n\nmuch more selective than cracking in producing diesel range hydrocarbons. However, sulfide \n\ncatalysts contaminate products via sulfur leaching and  lead also to catalyst deactivation (Huber, \n\net al., 2007). Compared with the hydrotreating process, catalytic deoxygenation possesses \n\nseveral advantages, including higher selectivity to the target linear hydrocarbons and less \n\nadditional hydrogen cost because of few hydrogen requirements. Decarboxylation, \n\ndecarbonylation and hydrodeoxygenation are the main reaction routes. Noble metal supported \n\ncatalysts (e.g., commercial Pd/C and Pt/C) are usually employed. However, the high price of \n\nnoble metal also limits the application in large-scale industrial production (Sn\u00e5re, et al., 2006).  \n\nTherefore, until green diesel gets solution to its drawbacks, no doubt that biodiesel will be \n\ncompetitive alternative to petro-diesel. Hence, biodiesel produced from transesterification of \n\nvegetable oils is around 80% of the current biofuel market in Europe (Bendz, 2005) and \n\nproduction is increasing exponentially reaching 9,500,000 tons in 2010 (Knothe, 2010). \n\n1.4. Microalgae Biochemistry and Biotechnology  \n\n1.4.1. Lipid Classes \n\nMicroalgae crude lipids contain two fundamental categories of lipids: neutral lipids (NLs) and \n\npolar lipids. The polar lipids comprise mainly phospholipids (PLs) and glycolipids (GLs) \n\n(Mayzaud, Boutoute, Perissinotto, &amp; Nichols, 2007; Ryckebosch, Muylaert, &amp; Foubert, 2012; \n\nFangfang Yang et al., 2014). For instance, hydrocarbons (HC), cholesterol, sterols, pigments ( \n\ni.e., ?-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, and astaxanthin etc.), tri, di and mono acyl glycerols (TAG, \n\nDAG, and MAG), fatty acids (FAs) , GLs and PLs were reported in  crude extracts of microalga \n\n(Brennan &amp; Owende, 2010; Jones, Manning, Montoya, Keller, &amp; Poenie, 2012). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n12 \n \n\n Neutral Lipids  \n\nNLs usually comprise up to 50% microalgae lipid content (Fangfang Yang, et al., 2014). They \n\nare water-insoluble, whereas polar lipids have one or more water-soluble functional groups \n\n(Mayzaud, et al., 2007; Ryckebosch, et al., 2012; Fangfang Yang, et al., 2014). TAG, DAG, \n\nMAG and FA are the main NLs fractions reported of which TAG is dominant in microalgae.  \n\nTAG, stored in adipose tissue, is a major form of energy storage in animals and plants \n\n(Brasaemle, 2007). NLs can be converted into a biodiesel via transesterification (Bendz, 2005) \n\n(Fig.1.8). Transesterification consists of three consecutive reversible reactions of TAG to DAG, \n\nfollowed by DAG to monoacylglycerol, and finally to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and \n\nglycerol (Fig.1.8). \n\n \n\n Fig. 1.8. Biodiesel production through transesterification of TAG \n\n \n\nThe transesterification reaction can be catalysed by alkaline catalysts such as sodium or \n\npotassium hydroxide (Knothe, 2005b). Such catalysts lead to complete conversion with 98% \n\nester yields. However, their efficiency decreases when  free fatty acids (FFAs) content is higher \n\nthan 0.5% (w/w%,  oil) due to saponification (Lotero et al., 2006; Lotero et al., 2005). On the \n\ncontrary, acid catalysts offer the advantage that they can catalyse the transesterification of \n\nacylglycerols and esterification of FFAs simultaneously.  \n\nGlycerol is a by-product of biodiesel, which is a very attractive raw material for fine chemicals \n\ndue to its relatively low cost and wide availability (Werpy et al., 2004). 26% of glycerol \n\nconsumption was associated with pharmaceutical, cosmetic and soap industries- wider  \n\napplications were reviewed and reported at (Fangxia Yang, Hanna, &amp; Sun, 2012). \n\nCH O C\n\nO\n\nR2\n\nH2C O C\n\nO\n\nR3\n\nH2C O C\n\nO\n\nR1\n\nH3C O C\n\nO\n\nR2\n\nH3C O C\n\nO\n\nR3\n\nH3C O C\n\nO\n\nR1\n\n+ CH3OH\nH+\n\nCH OH\n\nH2C OH\n\nH2C OH\n\n+\n\nTriacylglycerol                      Methanol                               FAMEs                             Glycerol\n\n\n\n  \n\n13 \n \n\nPhospholipids \n\nPLs are a class of lipids that are a major component of all cell membranes. They can form lipid \n\nbilayers because of their amphiphilic nature. The structure of the PLs molecule generally \n\nconsists of two hydrophobic FA \u201ctails\u201d and a hydrophilic phosphate \u201chead\u201d, joined together by \n\na glycerol molecule (Fig 1.9). They are widely distributed in animals and plants, and the main \n\nsources include vegetable oils (e.g. soybean) and animal tissues (e.g. egg yolk) (Wendel, 1995). \n\nHowever, soybean and egg yolk have differences in the contents and types of PLs. \n\nFor example: 1) egg yolk lecithin contains high amounts of PC; 2) PLs in egg yolk have long \n\nchain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) of n-6 and n-3 series, primarily arachidonic acid \n\n(AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which are absent from soybean lecithins; and 3) the \n\nsaturation level of egg yolk lecithins is higher than that of soybean lecithins (Hager, De Paoli, \n\nIhlo, Farach, &amp; Poole, 1993), so their oxidative stability is better than that of soybean lecithins.  \n\nEach individual PLs fraction provides the following functions (Fig 1.9): \n\n? Phosphatidylcholine (PC) has function of nourishing the brain and improving \n\nintelligence (Little, Levy, Chuaqui-Kidd, &amp; Hand, 1985);  \n\n? Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) has  important role in membrane fusion (Dowhan, \n\nBogdanov, &amp; Mileykovskaya, 2002);  \n\n? Phosphatidylserine (PS) improves function of nerve cells and enhancing the memory of \n\nbrain (Pepeu, Pepeu, &amp; Amaducci, 1996);  \n\n? Phosphatidylinositol (PI) plays a very important role in the process of transmission of \n\nmessages in neural system (Bansal &amp; Majerus, 1990);  \n\n? Phosphatidyic acid (PA) is a precursor for the biosynthesis of many other lipids (Delon \n\net al., 2004);  \n\n? Phosphatidylglycerol (PG) is a glycerophospholipid found in pulmonary surfactant \n\n(King &amp; MacBeth, 1981). \n\n \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipids\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_bilayer\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_bilayer\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphiphilic\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobic\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophile\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerol\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerophospholipid\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_surfactant\n\n\n  \n\n14 \n \n\nR1 C O\n\nO\n\nCH2\n\nCH\n\nH2C\n\nR2 C O\n\nO O P\n\nO\n\nO-\n\nO X Head group\n\nPhosphateGlycerolFatty acyl chains\n\nX=H, PA; -CH2-CH2-N(CH3)3,PC; -CH2-CH2-NH3,PE;\n\n-CH2-CH-NH3,PS;\n\nCOO\nHO\n\nOH\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\nPI;\n\n-CH2-CH-CH2OH;PG\n\nOH\n\n \n\n     Fig. 1.9.

Therapeutic agents such as \n\nproteins/peptides, nucleic acids, anticarcinogens, and other drugs have the drawbacks of low \n\nbioavailability, rapid clearance, and high toxicity. Liposomes have many advantages being able \n\nto deliver hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs, targeting, and tissue compatibility, reducing drug \n\ntoxicity and improving its stability (Fig 1.10). Liposomes can serve as the carriers of antitumor, \n\nantifungal, analgesic, in gene therapeutics and vaccines (Delalat et al., 2015; J. Li et al., 2015). \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n15 \n \n\n \n\nFig.1.10.

GLs \n\ncan be converted to biosurfactants (Abdel-Mawgoud, Hausmann, L\u00e9pine, M\u00fcller, &amp; D\u00e9ziel, \n\n2011; Kitamoto, Isoda, &amp; Nakahara, 2002). Biosurfactants show unique properties (e.g., mild \n\nproduction conditions, lower toxicity, higher biodegradability and environmental compatibility \n\ncompared to their chemical counterparts (Kitamoto, et al., 2002). The numerous advantages of \n\nbiosurfactants have applications not only in the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries \n\nbut in environmental protection (soil washing, oil spills cleaning). GLs biosurfactants are the \n\nmost promising due to high productivity from renewable resources (Kitamoto, et al., 2002).  \n\nO\nHO\n\nHO\n\nHO\nO\n\nH\n\nY\n\nOH\n\n \n\nFig. 1.11.

EPA and DHA are \n\nimportant in the treatment of atherosclerosis, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases such as \n\nAlzheimer\u2019s. AA and DHA are of special importance in the brain and blood vessels and are \n\nconsidered to be essential for pre and post-natal brain and retina development (Crawford, 2000). \n\nThe eicosanoids, such as prostaglandin, prostacyclin and leukotriene, derived from n-3-PUFAs \n\nare important for infant development, modulatory vascular resistance and wound healing \n\n(Sijtsma &amp; De Swaaf, 2004; Simopoulos, 1999). Modern nutritional theory is focusing on the \n\nnumerous health benefits of maintaining sufficient levels of n-3-PUFAs (V. Patil &amp; Gislerod, \n\n2006). \n\nThe principal dietary source of DHA and EPA is marine fish. Fish is a declining resource, and \n\nthere are serious environmental consequences related to the continued exploitation of fish \n\nstocks in order to meet the demands of an expanding market.  \n\nMoreover, fish accumulate pollutants. Also, the extracted oil often has an unpleasant odour, \n\nand the proportion of specific FAs in its TAG is difficult to control. The global aquaculture \n\nproduction was 547 million tonnes in 2003 (V. Patil, K\u00e4llqvist, Olsen, Vogt, &amp; Gisler\u00f8d, 2007) \n\nand it has been growing by roughly 9% annually (Naylor &amp; Burke, 2005). Feed is the largest \n\nproduction cost for commercial aquaculture plants, so improving feed efficiency in industrial \n\nsystems has high priority. Considerable evidence has indicated that n-3-PUFAs in fish oils are \n\nactually derived via the marine food chain from zooplankton consuming n-3-PUFAs -\n\nsynthesising microalgae (Yongmanitchai &amp; Ward, 1989). \n\nTherefore, marine microalgae are some of the most important feed sources in aquaculture (live \n\nfeed for larvae of bivalves, and marine fish; food for rotifers and shrimps), due to their \n\nnutritional value and their ability to synthesise and accumulate great amounts of n-3-PUFA. \n\nSpecific algal species are suitable for preparation of animal feed supplements. Algae species \n\nsuch as Chlorella, Scenedesmus, and Haematococcus have beneficial aspects including \n\nimproved immune response and fertility, and better weight control (Brennan &amp; Owende, 2010).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n17 \n \n\n1.4.2. Fatty Acid Composition \n\nHigher plants oil has suitable FAs for biodiesel production (Table 1.2). The major FAs are \n\npalmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), oleic acid (C18:1) and linoleic acid (C18:2). \n\nHowever, these oil bearing plants compete with food supply. \n\nTable 1.2.

Adapted from Peng (2012). \n\nIn algae, the most commonly synthesized FAs have chain lengths that range from C16 to C18, \n\nsimilar to those of higher plants (Hu et al., 2008; Ohlrogge &amp; Browse, 1995). In general, \n\nsaturated fatty acids (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) are predominant in \n\nmost algae (Alonso, Grima, P\u00e9rez, S\u00e1nchez, &amp; Camacho, 1992). Specifically, the major FAs \n\nare C16:0 and C16:1 in the Bacillariophyceae, C16:0 and C18:1 in the Chlorophyceae and \n\nPrasinophyceae, C16:0, C16:1 and C18:1 in the Chrysophyceae and Prymnesiophyceae, C16:0 \n\nand C20:1 in the Cryptophyceae, C14:0,  C16:0, C16:1 and C18:1 in Cyanobacteriaa (Cobelas \n\n&amp; Lechado, 1989). \n\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) contain two or more double bonds. Based on the number \n\nof double bonds, individual FAs are named dienoic, trienoic, tetraenoic, pentaenoic and \n\nhexaenoic FAs. Also, depending on the position of the first double bond from the terminal \n\nmethyl end (n) of the carbon chain, a FA may be either an n-3-PUFAs (i.e., the third carbon \n\nfrom the end of the FA) or an n-6-PUFAs (i.e., the sixth carbon from the end of the fatty acid). \n\nThe major PUFAs are C20:5 (n-3) and C22:6 (n-6) in Bacillarilophyceae, C18:2 and C18:3 (n-\n\n3)  in Euglenophyceae,C20:3 and C20:4 (n-3)  in Eustigmatophyceae, C18:5 (n-3)  and C22:6 \n\n(n-3)  in Dinophyceae, C18:2, C18:3 (n-3)  and C22:6 (n-3)  in Prymnesiophyceae,C18:2 and \n\nC20:5 in Rhodophyceae and C16:0, C18:2 and C18:3 (n-3)  in cyanobacteria (Basova, 2005).  \n\nTable 1.3 shows the FAs composition of different microalgae strains. The major FAs are C20:5, \n\npalmitoleic acid (C16:1), C16:0, C14:0, and arachidonic acid (C20:4) with lesser amounts of \n\n\n\n  \n\n18 \n \n\nC18:1 and C18:2.

For instance, the \n\nsum of PUFAs for P. tricornutum ranges from 14 to 48%. FAs profiles of lipid fractions were \n\nalso reported with widespread results. It is very likely that a different method of oil extraction, \n\nlipid sources, strain types, biomass production methods affect FAs distributions depending on \n\nthe relative proportion of polar and NLs (Ryckebosch, et al., 2012; Wang &amp; Wang, 2012). \n\nFAs profiles of individual lipid classes from ethanolic extracts of Nannochloropsis was reported \n\nat (Wang &amp; Wang, 2012). The total SFAs in TAG tended to be lower than that in polar lipids, \n\nand the TAG total MUFAs tended to be higher than that in polar lipids.  \n\nThe sum of SFAs and MUFAs are greater than sum of PUFAs in polar lipids. Following the \n\nsame protocol, the reverse results were reported for Schizochytrium. This shows strain types \n\ncan affect the FAs distribution. \n\n\n\n  \n\n20 \n \n\nRyckebosch et al .(2012) also detailed FAs composition (%TFA, w/w) of lipid class of P. \n\ntricornutum (Table 1.5). The dominant FAs in NLs were C16:0 and C16:1; in PLs were C16:0, \n\nC16:1 and C20:5; in GLs were C16:0, C16:1, C16:3 and C20:5. This finding implies that \n\nPUFAs especially EPA are associated with polar lipids and SFAs and MUFAs with NLs. \n\nHowever, the cells were grown in batch culture and continuously illuminated with two \n\nfluorescent lamps. This results may not be similar with biomass produced under normal growth \n\nconditions. In general, growth conditions can affect FAs distribution in both total lipids and \n\nlipid fractions. These details were disclosed for both N.oculata and P. tricornutum at (Shen et \n\nal., 2016) grown under nitrogen repletion  (N+) and depletion (N-). \n\n \n\nTable 1.5.

Problem Statement and Rationale  \n\nWe are in the century of uncertainty regarding petro-diesel supply as predictions show that they \n\nare about to be depleted (Azam, et al., 2005). More than affordability, availability seems pivotal. \n\nConsequently, it is time to work on how to reduce the cost of biodiesel production as it appears \n\nparticularly advantageous for the transportation sector. However, among the factors that affect \n\nthe cost of biofuels, biomass production seems a challenging venture than other factors and \n\nboosted responsibility on professionals specialized in the area (Brennan &amp; Owende, 2010).  \n\nBiomass Dewatering and the Way Forward to Reduce the Cost \n\nEnergy consumption of drying microalgae biomass accounted for the majority of the total \n\nprocessing energy (Lardon, Helias, Sialve, Steyer, &amp; Bernard, 2009; P. D. Patil, Reddy, et al., \n\n2012).Various researchers have investigated wet lipid extraction methods, including \n\nultrasound-assisted extraction (Adam, Abert-Vian, Peltier, &amp; Chemat, 2012), simultaneous \n\ndistillation and extraction process (Tanzi, Vian, &amp; Chemat, 2013), microwave-assisted \n\nextraction (Cheng, Yu, Li, Zhou, &amp; Cen, 2013), and supercritical fluid extraction (Halim, \n\nGladman, Danquah, &amp; Webley, 2011). Unfortunately, these require high temperature and long \n\ntimes; so they are not ideal for industrial-scale production. \n\nStandard methods for lipid extraction employ chloroform and methanol that are carcinogenic \n\n(Bligh &amp; Dyer, 1959; Folch, Lees, &amp; Sloane-Stanley, 1957). \n\nSome alcohols have the potential to extract lipids from microalgae (M. Chen et al., 2012; \n\nFajardo et al., 2007; Fangfang Yang, et al., 2014). FA composition of ethanolic extract was \n\nhigher when compared to some solvents (Fig.1.12) (Petrick et al., 2013). FAs recovery by \n\nethanol is better than chloroform, propanol, methanol or hexane (Fig.1.12). Ethanol \n\nsuccessfully extracts as much as the standard methods for lipid extraction as shown in (Fig.1.12) \n\n(Fangfang Yang, et al., 2014). Any physical pre-treatments to induce cell lysis (e.g., sonication \n\nor microwaves), which if applied incur additional costs, are not essential and instead extraction \n\ntwice is sufficient. Extraction can be carried out at reflux or room temperature and is not energy \n\nconsuming (Fangfang Yang, et al., 2014). Ethanol is a food grade solvent when compared with \n\nchloroform and methanol. Unlike higher plants lipids, microalgal lipids are complex for they \n\ncomprise almost equal proportion of both neutral and polar lipids. Hence, a solvent that has \n\nboth polar and non-polar nature is more effective at extracting total lipids from wet microalgae \n\nbiomass than a purely non-polar.  \n\n\n\n  \n\n22 \n \n\nFor instance, hexane is not effective at extracting total lipids from wet microalgae biomass but \n\neffective at extracting from higher plants. It seems hexane or non-polar may extract mainly the \n\nNLs from microalga and the polar are left in spent biomass as waste. \n\nThere are some reports where extraction by alcohols from wet biomass containing water is  \n\neasier than from dried biomass. For example, 2-ethoxyethanol is claimed to be more effective \n\nat extracting lipids from wet microalgal biomass than dried  as compared to chloroform: \n\nmethanol or hexane (Jones, et al., 2012).  \n\n \n\nFig. 1.12. Comparison of lipid extraction using different solvents (Petrick, et al., 2013) \n\nThe Merits of Microalgae Lipid Separation \n\nPlant oils, such as palm, rape, sunflower, etc., are TAG containing about 90% FAs (Petkov, \n\nIvanova, Iliev, &amp; Vaseva, 2012). They are relatively easy to be extracted from seeds. Unlike \n\nthe seeds of many higher plants, microalgal lipids are not only TAG. For example, TAG of the \n\nhighly oleaginous alga Parietochloris incisa represent 42.9% of total lipids, and TAG of \n\nPavlova lutheri are 40.3% (Petkov, et al., 2012). The percentages of TAG are lower in the dried \n\nlipid extract where chlorophyll, carotenoids, sterols are concentrated, too. \n\n \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n%\n  \nF\nA\n\n (\nT\n\nF\nA\n\n,w\n/w\n\n)\n\nSolvents\n\n\n\n  \n\n23 \n \n\nFor instance, after hydrolysis of 1 kg microalgal lipids, the usual products are 0.3\u20130.5 kg FAs, \n\n0.2\u20130.4 kg unsaponifiable substances (e.g., hydrocarbons, carotenoids, and sterols etc.,), and \n\n0.2\u20130.3 kg water soluble substances (i.e., glycerol, and phosphoric acid) (Petkov et al., 2012). \n\nAlgal lipids are predominantly mono- and digalactosyl diacylglycerols, PLs and unsaponifiable \n\nsubstances, and subsequently the FAs content reaches up to 31\u201332% as a mean value.  \n\nGalactose, glycerol, and phosphoric acid, which are esterified in lipid molecules during this \n\ntreatment, will lose their quality as nutrient components, or will be completely wasted. As a \n\nresult, microalgal lipids have two to three times lower content of FAs compared to plant oils. It \n\nwas reported that 15 kg biomass of Chlorella and Scenedesmus can render 1 kg biodiesel. This \n\nshows except 31\u201332% of FAs, the remaining is waste. Waste has environmental and socio-\n\neconomic impacts and necessitates the way forward to reduce the impacts. \n\nOne approach can be via applying the bio-refinery concept (Cherubini, 2010; Morais &amp; Bogel-\n\nLukasik, 2013).Ethanol or other solvents extract total lipids which contain both neutral and \n\npolar lipids (i.e., GLs and PLs). But, separating polar lipids from NLs of microalgae for \n\npreparing biodiesel are important for several merits (Iyer, 2016). For example, unsaturated \n\nlipids occur more frequently in polar lipid fractions specifically PLs (Foley, Beach, &amp; \n\nZimmerman, 2011). The PUFAs are highly prone to  spontaneous oxidation as they contain \n\nmultiple double bonds (Ostrea, Cepeda, Fleury, &amp; Balun, 1985).  \n\nFurthermore, the phosphate moiety in PLs complicates transesterification (Iyer, 2016; Van \n\nGerpen, 2005). Yield of FAMEs was reduced when soybean oil with significant amount of PLs \n\nwas transesterified with C. antarctica lipase (Watanabe, Shimada, Sugihara, &amp; Tominaga, \n\n2002). The presence of 5 and 10% (w/w, DW) PLs in soybean oil decreases the yield of FAMEs \n\nby 6.8 and 9.7% (w/w, DW) (Y. Li, Du, &amp; Liu, 2014). The separation of PLs from NLs \n\nincreased the yield of FAMEs (Freedman, Pryde, &amp; Mounts, 1984). Therefore, separation of \n\nthe neutral from the polar has dual advantages: it improves biodiesel quality and yield; and \n\npolar lipids can be used as value added products. The polar lipids comprise around 50% of the \n\ntotal lipids (Fangfang Yang, et al., 2014).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n24 \n \n\nAlthough these Omega-3-FAs are obtained from fish oil, they are claimed to be derived from \n\nmicroalgae via food chain (Yongmanitchai &amp; Ward, 1989). EPA and DHA have the potential to \n\nchange the fluidity and permeability of the membrane (Burri, Hoem, Banni, &amp; Berge, 2012). \n\nLiposome from PLs enriched in these FAs are targeting and can deliver both hydrophilic and \n\nhydrophobic drugs. Hence, chromatographic separation of these lipids are essential. \n\nBesides, PLs separation from NLs is good to comply with regulations and for the safety of the \n\nengine. For instance, ASTM D6751 standards state that phosphorus content should be below \n\n10 ppm. A higher phosphorus content (>10 ppm) in biodiesel would result in phosphorus \n\nremaining in exhaust emissions during combustion of FAMEs (biodiesel) poisoning the catalyst \n\nin the converter, resulting in serious damage to the catalytic converter (Kaleli, 2001; Tyson &amp; \n\nMcCormick, 2006).  \n\nThe presence of polar lipids necessitates using more methanol as they contain acyl groups \n\ninvolving in transesterification. The excess moles of methanol will get solubilized in micelles \n\nleading to localized concentration of methanol around the catalyst, resulting in lowering the \n\nactivity of the catalyst and subsequently reducing the yield of FAMEs (Kaleli, 2001; Tyson &amp; \n\nMcCormick, 2006).  \n\nHowever, finding industrially feasible lipid separation or oil degumming (first stage in oil \n\nrefining process) is essential. The most commonly used chemicals (chloroform and methanol) \n\nfor lipid separation are carcinogenic and requires silica column that cannot be beyond lab scale.   \n\nDegumming of crude soybean oil has been carried out by ultrafiltration using polymeric \n\nmembranes (Pagliero, Ochoa, Marchese, &amp; Mattea, 2001 &amp; 2004). However, the instability \n\nof polymeric membranes in organic solvents has been the barriers to oil degumming/refining. \n\nCeramic membrane for oil degumming is energy intensive and so costly (De Souza, Petrus, \n\nGon\u00e7alves, &amp; Viotto, 2008).  \n\nThe drawback of the alkali refining process is the entrainment of significant quantities of neutral \n\noil with the soap stock resulting in a loss of yield. Additional costs are incurred by the soap \n\nstock splitting and effluent treatment. Acid degumming process is usually carried out at elevated \n\ntemperature around 90\u00b0C (Mag &amp; Reid, 1980). The organic refining process (Copeland &amp; \n\nBelcher, 2000) uses a large excess of citric acid.  \n\n \n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260877407005705\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260877407005705\n\n\n  \n\n25 \n \n\nIn degumming, enzymes are incapable of catalysing the hydrolysis of non-hydratable \n\nphosphatides (alkaline earth salts of phosphatidic acid) under industrial conditions (Dijkstra, \n\n2010). Enzymes are expensive and the amount available for industrial scale is not enough, thus \n\nits activity can be affected by extreme conditions such as high temperature and organic solvents, \n\nfor example lower alcohol, methanol or ethanol. \n\nConsequently, in our study we used binary phase system (hexane + water) and separated the \n\npolar lipids from NLs employing a process known as Liquid Tri-phase System (LTPS). Hexane \n\nis relatively tolerable solvent and water is safer. Less energy consuming mixing process was \n\napplied and lipid classes of various FAs and wider applications were separated under the \n\nbiorefinery scheme. To get optimum amount of distinctly separated lipid classes in short span \n\nof time, centrifugation needs to be applied over mixing. The solvents are recovered and reused. \n\nIn this regard, we hypothesize the cost of biodiesel production can be reduced and our waste \n\nfoot print and economic loss due to the polar lipids use, too. In our view, this is a contribution \n\nto research gaps and first report of oil degumming that can be feasible industrially. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n26 \n \n\n1.6. Objectives \n\n1.6.1. Main Objective  \n\nTo obtain a neutral lipid rich fraction free of phospholipids and glycolipids to produce biodiesel \n\nfrom microalgae and, at the same time, get a phospholipids and glycolipids rich fraction with \n\nbiomedical or food and/or feed or other industrial applications under a biorefinery scheme, \n\nusing an industrially relevant method. \n\n1.6.2. Other Objectives  \n\nTo extract lipids from wet biomass of N. oculata and P. tricornutum using ethanol \n\n \n\nTo separate the colloidal part from the liquid fractions employing the Liquid Tri-phase System.  \n\n \n\nTo analyse the lipid classes and fatty acids composition of the obtained fractions using HPLC-\n\nELSD and GC-MS, respectively.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n27 \n \n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nExperiments were conducted in the laboratory of the Marine Biotechnology group, from the \n\nCentre of Marine Sciences (CCMAR) at the University of Algarve, Faro, Portugal.  \n\n2.1. Materials  \n\nThe microalgal biomass from N. oculata and P. tricornutum was supplied by NECTON S.A., \n\nPortugal. Both cultures were grown outdoors in flat panel and tubular photobioreactors. \n\nBiomass harvesting was performed by centrifugation, and the resulting microalga paste was \n\nfrozen at -20\u00b0C until use. \n\nAll chemicals used in this experiment were of analytical grade and HPLC grade solvents were \n\nused only for HPLC-ELSD and GC-MS. \n\n2.2. Methods \n\n2.2.1. Moisture Content \n\nPrior to lipid extraction, 1g of microalgae biomass was incubated in an oven at 60\u00b0C for 72 h \n\n(n=3) in order to determine its moisture content. The percentage moisture in the biomass was \n\ncalculated using (Eq .2.1): \n\nMoisture content = [(W1- W2)/ (W1-Wp)] *100 % ---------------------------------------- (Eq. 2.1)  \n\nWhere, W1 = Original weight of the sample (with plate) before drying \n\n             W2 = Weight of the sample (with plate) after drying and Wp = Plate weight \n\n2.2.2. Total Lipid Extraction  \n\nLipids were extracted according to the protocol described in (Yao, Gerde, &amp; Wang, 2012) with \n\na few modifications. Briefly, 10.0 g of microalgae paste containing 70.0% water was dispersed \n\nin 100 mL of ethanol and stirred at reflux temperature of ethanol (78.5oC) for 90 min (Scheme \n\n2.1). After refluxing, the mixture was centrifuged at 5,000 rpm and 20oC for 10 min. The \n\nsupernatant (Ethanol (ET)-1) was separated from the pellet by decanting. The insoluble matter \n\nwas further extracted with ethanol under reflux conditions for 30 min (ET-2, 50 mL) and 15 \n\nmin (ET-3, 25 mL), followed by centrifugation under the same conditions and filtered through \n\nWhatman no. 4 filter paper. Ethanol and water were recovered from the mixture using a rotatory \n\nevaporator under reduced pressure. The lipid content was estimated using (Eq. 2.2). \n\n Biomass lipid content = [Wo/Ws] *100 % ------------------------------------------------- (Eq. 2.2)  \n\nWhere, Wo = weight of lipid extracted; Ws = weight of sample  \n\n\n\n  \n\n28 \n \n\n \n\n          Scheme 2.1. Lipids extraction from wet microalgae using ethanol   \n\n2.2.3. Lipid Characterization \n\nLipid Profiles \n\nLipids were separated into NLs, GLs and PLs using column chromatography applying the \n\nmethod described at (Wang &amp; Wang, 2012) with little modification (Scheme 2.2). Briefly, 2.0 \n\ng of lipid, 100 mL of chloroform: methanol (1:1, v/v) and 2.0-5.0 g of silica were mixed in 500 \n\nmL rounded bottom conical flask. Then, the mixture was rotary-evaporated until dryness. Next, \n\nit was loaded on top of a 1.4 cm I.D. x 18 cm length glass column filled with 30 g silica gel \n\n(60\u00b5m). The NLs were first eluted using 300 mL chloroform, then 300 mL of acetone: methanol \n\n(9:1, v/v) for GLs; and lastly 300 mL methanol for PLs. The solvents were recovered from each \n\nlipid classes and the weight of the lipids was measured and calculated (% w/w, total lipids). \n\n\n\n  \n\n29 \n \n\nMicroalgae crude extracts and lipid fractions were characterized by HPLC (KNAUER) coupled \n\nwith an Evaporative Light Scattering Detector (ELSD; Agilent Technologies, Varian 380-LC) \n\nto analyse the major lipid classes. \n\nBefore use, HPLC grade solvents were filtered with (Nylon membrane, 0.45\u00b5m, and 47mm) \n\nand degassed. After optimization of the parameters for the ELSD, evaporator temperature was \n\nset at 50oC and nebulizer at 45oC. The flow rate of the carrier gas (compressed pure nitrogen) \n\nwas maintained at 1.60 SLM. Gain and smoothing factor was fixed at 2 and 30, respectively.  \n\nLipid standards and microalgae extracts were resolved using Phenomenex sphereClone column \n\n(250 mm x 4.6 mm ID, 5\u00b5m particle size). Data acquisition was performed using Clarity \n\nsoftware (3.1.7) (VWR, Darmstadt, Germany).  \n \n\nThe separation of lipid fractions was achieved with a gradient programme shown below (Table \n\n2.1). A combination of four different solvents was used as follows, hexane: ethylacetate:water: \n\nisopropanol. Briefly, samples were injected at time 0.0 and were eluted with hexane- \n\nethylacetate-isopropanol (98:1:1, v/v/v) for 10.0 min at a linear flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. \n\nSolvents were changed from 98:1:1: to isopropanol (100%) at  flow rate of 0.8mL/min over the \n\nnext  15min. After 25min, the elution solvent was changed to isopropanol : water (75:25; v/v \n\nusing  the same flow rate 0.8mL/min for 5.0 min. In the next 10.0 min, 100.0% isopropanol was \n\nused to remove the polar contaminants (if any). After 40min the first solvent mixtures were run \n\nagain to equilibrate the  column for 10 to 15min and the next samples were injected. \n\nTable 2.1.

Fatty Acid Composition \n\nLipids (i.e., crude extracts and NLs fractions) were converted into their corresponding FAMEs \n\nusing methanol by an acid catalysed method. The FAMEs profile was then characterized \n\nemploying GC-MS.  \n\nTransesterification was done according to the method reported by Lam &amp; Lee (2013) with little \n\nmodifications. Briefly microalgae lipids were mixed with a solution of methanol and 2% H2SO4 \n\nin a 500 mL rounded bottom flask and stirred at reflux temperature (64\u201369\u00b0C) for 4h. The \n\nreaction was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using hexane and ethylacetate \n\n(95:5, v/ v). After reaction completion, solvent was removed up to 1/4 of the volume to reduce \n\nemulsions and sequentially extracted three times with hexane. Hexane fractions were \n\ntransferred to a separating funnel and washed with distilled water until the acid was neutralized, \n\nfollowed by a saturated NaCl solution treatment. It was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, \n\nand recovered using a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure to obtain FAMEs.  \n\nThe FAMEs profile was determined in an Agilent GC-MS (Agilent 6890 Network GC System, \n\n5973 Inert Mass Selective Detector) equipped with a DB5-MS capillary column (25 m\u00d70.25 \n\nmm internal diameter, 0.25 ?m film thickness, Agilent). Helium was used as a carrier gas, while \n\nthe injector and detector were maintained at 300\u00b0C. The oven temperature was programmed for \n\n60\u00b0C (1 min), 30\u00b0C min?1 to 120\u00b0C, 5\u00b0C min?1 to 250\u00b0C, and 20\u00b0C min?1 to 300\u00b0C (2 min). \n\nIdentification and quantification of FAMEs (total ion mode) were performed by comparing the \n\nretention times of FAMEs samples with an external standard (Supelco 37 Component FAMEs \n\nMix, Sigma-Aldrich) and further confirmed by comparison of the MS spectra. For \n\nquantification purposes, a separate calibration curve was generated for each of the FAMEs in \n\nthe standard.  \n\n\n\n  \n\n31 \n \n\n \n\n   Scheme 2.2. Lipid separation using column chromatography  \n\n2.3. Liquid Tri-phase System (LTPS) \n\nIn LTPS, we used binary phase system (hexane + water) and separate the total lipids of \n\nmicroalgae into three major classes. Hexane is relatively tolerable solvent and water is almost \n\ngreen. Crude ethanolic extract of microalgae (1.83 g) was re-suspended in a mixture of hexane \n\nand water (160 mL, 1:1, v/v) and shaken for 1-3 min. Three phases were observed after mixing \n\nand, especially after centrifugation (5,000 rpm, 20oC, and 10 min) (Scheme 2.3): the upper \n\nhexane phase, the middle colloidal phase and the lower water phase. The mixture was then \n\nfiltrated. The colloidal fraction was left on filter paper and the filtrate containing hexane and \n\nwater phases were collected and repeated for 3-4 times under similar conditions as mentioned \n\nabove; further  transferred to a separating funnel and separated into hexane and water phases as \n\nshown in Scheme 2.3. \n\n\n\n  \n\n32 \n \n\nThe lipid profiles of the hexane, colloidal and water phases were further determined with \n\nHPLC-ELSD as described in section 2.2.3.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n3.1. Moisture Content and Lipid Extraction \n\nLipids were extracted with ethanol from the microalgal paste containing 70.0% (w/w) water. \n\nN. oculata showed higher ethanol extract yield of 38.2 % (w/w, dry weight (DW)) followed by \n\nthat of P. tricornutum (30.3%), which is in line with the yields reported by Rajvanshi and \n\nSharma (2012). This finding for N. oculata is similar to that reported previously for isopropanol \n\nextracts of the same strain (42.0%) (Gangadhar, et al., 2015) and a modified Bligh-Dyer \n\nstandard extract (39.1%) (Bondioli, et al., 2012); however, other author\u2019s obtained lower yields \n\nfor ethanolic extract (22.0%) (Wang &amp; Wang, 2012). Similarly, the result reported for P. \n\ntricornutum (20-30%) is in line with (Singh, Carlson, Fell, &amp; Poolman, 2015); but not to \n\nGangadhar et al.(2015) whose result was (37.0%). In general, ethanolic extraction provided \n\nbetter or nearly the same yield as standard method (Bligh-Dyer) for lipid extraction for different \n\nmicroalga strains such as Picochlorum sp , Selenastrum rinoi  and others (Bligh &amp; Dyer, 1959; \n\nPetrick, et al., 2013; Fangfang Yang, et al., 2014).  \n\nThe use of ethanol has several advantages. It is a greener alternative to carcinogenic solvents \n\n(e.g., chloroform-methanol or hexane commonly used for lipid extraction); being a food-grade \n\nsolvent, it enables the use of product or by-product in food and/or feed applications in the \n\ninterest of spent biomass; it minimizes the high energy intensive dewatering costs (Brennan &amp; \n\nOwende, 2010; Lardon et al., 2009; P. D. Patil, Gude, et al., 2012) as extraction can be done \n\ndirectly from wet biomass; high lipid yields can be obtained at ambient temperature (ethanol \n\nreflux temperature, 78.5oC) or room temperature (Fangfang Yang et al., 2014) unlike biomass \n\ngasification (1000oC) or hydrothermal liquefaction (300oC) or flash pyrolysis (Brennan &amp; \n\nOwende, 2010). Physical pre-treatments for example sonication or microwaves can be avoided \n\nto induce cell lysis, which if employed acquire additional costs, are not essential and instead \n\nextracting for duplicate is sufficient. It was also reported that physical pre-treatments are not \n\nmandatory and extraction twice is sufficient for maximum lipid recovery using methanol: \n\nchloroform (1:1, v/v) (Ryckebosch et al., 2012).  \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n34 \n \n\n3.2. Lipid Characterization \n\n3.2.1. Lipid Profiles \n\nThe total lipids extracted from microalgae were separated into lipid classes (i.e. NLs, GLs and \n\nPLs) using silica gel column chromatography. Lipid class distribution (% w/w, total lipids (TL)) \n\nof N. oculata was 45.1, 22.1 and 32.8% for NLs, GLs and PLs, respectively (Fig 3.1). These \n\nresults are in agreement with the findings of Wang and Wang (2012) for the same strain and of \n\nFangfang Yang et al.(2014) for Picochlorum sp. And, P. tricornutum lipid distribution was \n\n23.2, 49.1 and 27.7% for NLs, GLs and PLs, respectively (Fig 3.1). This result is in line with \n\nthe report of Miranda et al. (2015) for the same microalgae strain. It contains more GLs but less \n\nNLs than N. oculata. The PLs contents of both strains are nearly the same. \n\n \n\nFig. 3.1. N. oculata and P. tricornutum lipid classes separated by silica gel column \n\nchromatography. NL-neutral lipid, GL-glycolipid, PL-phospholipid \n\n \n\nHPLC-ELSD was used to determine the lipid fractions present in the microalgae crude extracts \n\nand in the fractions separated by silica gel column chromatography (i.e., NLs, GLs and PLs). \n\nIn this regard, we achieved the separation of standards TAG, DAG, FA, MG and PLs in just 40 \n\nminutes (Fig. 3.2). The more non-polar, TAG, was eluted first, followed by DAG, FA and \n\nMAG. PLs were the last to elute in this gradient program.  \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nN.oculata P. tricornutum\n\nL\nip\n\nid\n c\n\no\nn\nte\n\nn\nt \n\n(%\n)\n\nNL\n\nGL\n\nPL\n\n\n\n  \n\n35 \n \n\n \n\n                    Fig. 3.2.

Closely related finding was reported for Chlorella and C. kessleri  (Jones, et \n\nal., 2012; Kobayashi et al., 2013) and marine zooplankton (Graeve &amp; Janssen, 2009). However, \n\nthere are unidentified fractions which need more standards and further analysis. GLs was \n\nseparated well; but necessitates standard to identify the fraction types.  \n\nOn the other hand, the PLs fractions have very close retention times and a full separation would \n\nrequire further method optimization. Despite the peaks need further resolution, it is possible to \n\nascertain that we achieved to obtain a NLs fraction free of polar lipids for biodiesel production; \n\nand at the same time, a polar lipids rich fraction for value added chemicals (Fig. 3.4 to 3.6).  \n\n\n\n  \n\n36 \n \n\n \n\n                   Fig. 3.3.

HPLC-ELSD chromatogram of the NLs fraction of N. oculata  \n\n\n\n  \n\n37 \n \n\nThe area percentage of NLs was 42.2%, which is close to the one estimated from column \n\nchromatography (45.1%). The amounts of TAG, DAG, FA and MAG in NLs were 48.2, 8.51, \n\n12.1 and 13.9%, respectively. TAG is the dominant fraction in NL. The remaining 17.3% were \n\nunidentified lipids.  \n\nFigure 3.5 confirms separation of the GLs from both the NLs and PLs by silica gel column \n\nchromatography. GLs accounted for 22.1% of N. oculata total lipids. GLs can be converted to \n\nnon-ionic biosurfactants (Abdel-Mawgoud, et al., 2011; Kitamoto, et al., 2002). Biosurfactants  \n\nare less toxic and biodegradable compared to their chemical counterparts (Kitamoto, et al., \n\n2002). They have prompted applications in the food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical industries and \n\nenvironmental protection (soil washing, oil spills cleaning) (Kitamoto, et al., 2002).  \n\nOn the contrary, nonylphenol ethoxylate and other alkylphenol ethoxylates are widely used \n\nnon-ionic surfactants. They are converted in the environment to nonylphenol. Nonylphenol is \n\nan endocrine disruptor with estrogenic activity via mimicking female sex hormone (Ying, \n\nWilliams, &amp; Kookana, 2002).

Fatty Acid Composition \n\nFAs composition of the crude lipid extract and the NLs fraction were calculated in terms of \n\ntotal fatty acids (TFA). The main FAs detected in crude extract of N. oculata were myristic acid \n\n(C14:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), palmitoleic acid (C16:1), and EPA (C20:5) (Table 3.1). This \n\nfinding is in line with those reported previously (Bellou, et al., 2014; Gangadhar, et al., 2015). \n\nSFAs and MUFAs account for more than 58.0%. These FAs are suitable for biodiesel as they \n\nare less susceptible to oxidation. The remaining PUFAs like  EPA (30.6%) are needed to be \n\nseparated and optimized for industrial production for biomedical feed and/or food as nutritional \n\nsupplements (Drevon, Baksaas, &amp; Krokan, 1993; Simopoulos, 1999).  \n\nThe major FAs detected in the NLs fraction of N. oculata were C16:0, C16:1 and C18:1 (Table \n\n3.1). In this fraction, the sum of SFAs and MUFAs are greater than 86.0%. This implies that \n\nNLs contain less PUFAs; therefore, it is more suitable for biodiesel production than crude \n\nextract which is more prone to oxidation due to 42.0% PUFAs it contains.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n39 \n \n\nTable 3.1.

These results are closely related to Ryckebosch et al.(2012) and \n\nGangadhar et al.(2015). The sum of SFAs and MUFAs are greater than 71.0%. These FAs are \n\nsuitable for biodiesel as they are less susceptible to oxidative instability. Therefore, the \n\nremaining PUFAs like  EPA (22.6%) has to be separated and optimized for industrial \n\nproduction for feed and/or food or biomedical applications (Drevon, et al., 1993; Simopoulos, \n\n1999). N. oculata crude extract has more EPA than P. tricronutum crude extract. But, NLs \n\nfraction of P. tricronutum has twice more EPA than N. oculata NLs fraction. \n\nThe dominant FAs in NLs were C16:0, C16:1 and C18:1 (Table 3.2). The sum of SFAs and \n\nMUFAs are greater than 82.5%. The implication is NLs comprise less PUFAs and; therefore, \n\nit is suitable candidate for biodiesel production than directly from crude extracts.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n40 \n \n\nTable 3.2.

The yields of the different fractions were, for N. oculata, 27.4, 53.4 and \n\n19.2% for the hexane, colloidal and water phases, whereas for P. tricornutum, 30.6, 55.4 and \n\n14.0%, respectively (Fig. 3.7).  \n\nThe colloidal phase was further separated using silica gel column chromatography. It was \n\ncomposed of 5.1, 23.4 and 71.5% of NLs, GLs and PLs, respectively for N. oculata. Similarly, \n\nP. tricornutum colloidal consisted of 3.0, 28.7, and 68.3% of NLs, GLs and PLs, respectively. \n\nThese results reveal that  the colloidal phase is a rich source of PLs.  \n\nFatty acids Crude extract Neutral lipids \n\nC14:0 9.3 \u00b1 1.1 6.4 \u00b1 1.7 \n\nC16:0 25.9 \u00b1 1.5 21.9 \u00b1 4.1 \n\nC18:0 2.1 \u00b1 1.4 2.1 \u00b1 0.9 \n\n?SFA 37.3 30.4 \n\nC16:1(n-6) 29.1 \u00b1 1.4 21.7 \u00b1 2.1 \n\nC18:1(n-9)  4.7 \u00b1 0.8 30.9 \u00b1 2.1 \n\n?MUFA 33.8 52.6 \n\nC18:2(n-6) 3.7 \u00b1 0.8 1.6 \u00b1 0.1 \n\nC20:4(n-6) 2.7 \u00b1 0.9 1.8 \u00b1 0.3 \n\nC20:5(n-3) 22.6 \u00b1 3.4 13.6 \u00b1 3.6 \n\n?PUFA 28.9 17.0 \n\n\n\n  \n\n41 \n \n\n \n\n              Fig. 3.7.

In the hexane fraction (Fig. 3.8), more \n\nthan 93.7% was composed of NLs and the remaining with PLs (6.3%). GLs were not detected \n\nand the PLs fractions are not significant. As a result, the hexane phase is suitable aspirant to be \n\nused for biodiesel production as it is almost free from polar lipids. \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nN.oculata P.tricronutum\n\nL\nip\n\nid\n c\n\no\nn\nte\n\nn\nt \n\n(%\n)\n\nHexane\n\nColloidal\n\nWater\n\n\n\n  \n\n42 \n \n\n \n\n                      Fig. 3.8.

The approximate area \n\npercentages were 8.6, 27.8 and 63.5 for NLs, GLs and PLs, respectively. This was a similar to \n\nthose obtained from column chromatography (which were 5.1, 23.4, and 71.5 for NLs, GLs and \n\nPLs, respectively). This indicates that the colloidal phase was composed of more polar lipids \n\nparticularly PLs. Hence, this phase can be used for other value added products such as liposome, \n\naquaculture feed or biomedical applications (Drevon, et al., 1993; Simopoulos, 1999). In this \n\nregard, the contributions of the present study are to introduce the new amphiphilic or \n\namphipathic phase, the colloidal phase of wider industrial applications, partitioned between the \n\nnon-polar hexane upper phase and the polar water lower phase. \n\n\n\n  \n\n43 \n \n\n \n\n                   Fig. 3.9.

These fractions appeared only in \n\nPLs of the chromatograms. These lipids might be highly hydrolysed PLs fractions (e.g., LPC). \n\nIt might be sugar and/or peptides. Despite logical conclusion that they are polar (by principle \n\nof like dissolves like), scientific conclusion demands concrete evidence.  Such polar lipids can \n\nbe used to produce bioalchols (Chen et al., 2013). However, this has been left for further \n\ninvestigation as standards are essential and attention was given to the two phases (i.e., hexane \n\nand colloidal) to study their FAs profiles using GC-MS. But, this is an indication of applying \n\nbiorefinery scheme by using the whole lipids for several kinds of applications. \n\n\n\n  \n\n44 \n \n\n \n\n                        Fig. 3.10. Lipid classes composition of the water fraction (LTPS) N. oculata \n\n3.3.2. Fatty Acid Composition \n\nGC-MS analysis for fatty acid profiles was done only for the hexane and colloidal fractions as \n\nthe water phase contained insignificant amount of lipids in the PLs region. Because the principal \n\nobjective is biodiesel production from NLs. Besides, a great focus was given to polar lipid rich \n\nfractions (i.e., colloidal enriched in PLs and GLs) due to their economic value and high demand \n\nin world market for liposome, nutritional supplement to infant formula and biosurfactants as \n\nwell. Despite this fact, bioethanol produced from the water phase can further reduce the cost of \n\nbiodiesel from microalgae under the biorefinery scheme. As a result, it is utterly recommended \n\nfor future study. Furthermore, the spent biomass can be utilized as feed for food in aquaculture \n\nor for biogas or bio-fertilizer to complete the biorefinery concept.  \n\nTable 3.3 shows the main FAs detected in N. oculata. Hexane phase FAs were C14:0, C16:0, \n\nC16:1 and C18:1. The sum of SFAs and MUFAs in this phase was more than 88.0%. This has \n\na lot of advantages for biodiesel production from NLs than crude extract. Foley et al. (2011) \n\nstates highly unsaturated lipids occur more frequently in polar lipid fractions specifically PLs. \n\nSo, separating the polar lipids from neutral lipids can also enhance the biodiesel quality (i.e, \n\nreduce the oxidation) and  thus increase the yield of FAMEs (Freedman, et al., 1984; Y. Li, et \n\nal., 2014; Watanabe, et al., 2002). Furthermore, it helps to comply with specifications such as \n\nEN 14214 and ASTM D6751 standards for phosphorus content should be less than 4ppm \n\naccording to EN 14214 or 10ppm as per ASTM D6751 specifications (Kaleli, 2001; Tyson &amp; \n\nMcCormick, 2006).   \n\n\n\n  \n\n45 \n \n\nThe colloidal fraction contains some FAs as in hexane phase (Table 3.3). However, it consists \n\nof 43.2% of PUFAs such as C20:5, C20:4 and C18:2. As a result, while the hexane phase can \n\nbe used for biodiesel, the colloidal is able to be used in the treatment of atherosclerosis, cancer, \n\nand neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s because it contains omega-3-FAs (Drevon, \n\net al., 1993; Simopoulos, 1999). It can also be used for infant formula nutritional supplement \n\nbecause of arachidonic acid (Sijtsma &amp; De Swaaf, 2004; Simopoulos, 1999) and aquaculture \n\nfeed (Brennan &amp; Owende, 2010; Pulz &amp; Gross, 2004; Spolaore, et al., 2006). In addition, it \n\ncontains conditionally essential FAs like linoleic acid (C18:2). This is an attempt to apply the \n\nbio-refinery scheme so that microalgae can be competitive feedstock for biodiesel. \n\nThis finding shows LC-PUFAs occur more frequently in polar lipid fractions specifically \n\ncolloidal phase containing both PLs and GLs. This is in line with Foley et al.(2011) who \n\nreported unsaturated FAs are related to polar lipids specially PLs . For example, EPA in P. \n\ntricornutum is mainly associated with PLs and GLs (Ryckebosch, et al., 2012). Such FAs are \n\navailable in very few organisms such as fish oil. However, considerable evidences have \n\nindicated that n-3-PUFAs in fish oils are actually derived via the marine food chain from \n\nzooplankton consuming n-3-PUFAs synthesising microalgae; fish accumulates pollutants up \n\nfood chain and fish oil is with unpleasant smell (Yongmanitchai &amp; Ward, 1989).Therefore, \n\nmicroalgae are some of the most promising feedstock for biofuels and/or biomaterials. Other \n\napplications of PLs fractions include improving intelligence and  function of nerve cells (J. Li, \n\net al., 2015; Pepeu, et al., 1996). Therefore, it is very important to separate let alone the general \n\nlipid classes even each lipid fractions with in the classes to get wider applications from each \n\nchemical or compound entity. \n\nIn addition, EPA and DHA have the ability to influence cell membrane fluidity and permeability \n\n(Burri, et al., 2012). These omega-3-FAs are rarely available in higher plants lipids but \n\nmicroalgae PLs are enriched in these FAs (Ryckebosch, et al., 2012). This implies that PLs \n\nfrom microalgae can deliver both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs to the target site as \n\nmicroalgae contain both non-polar and polar lipids. Such PLs liposomes have many advantages: \n\ntargeting, tissue compatibility, reducing drug toxicity and improving its stability. Consequently, \n\nsuch liposomes can serve as the carriers of antitumor, antifungal, analgesic, in gene therapeutics \n\nand vaccines (Delalat, et al., 2015; J. Li, et al., 2015; Pattni, et al., 2015).  \n\n\n\n  \n\n46 \n \n\n \n\nTable 3.3. FAs composition of N. oculata fractions obtained by LTPS. Results are expressed \n\nas mean \u00b1 standard deviation (n = 2) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSimilarly, Table 3.4 shows the main FAs detected in P. tricronutum. Hexane phase FAs were \n\nmainly C16:0, C16:1 and C18:1 (Table 3.4). The sum of SFAs and MUFAs in this phase was \n\nmore than 82.5%. These FAs are good for biodiesel as they are less prone to oxidation when \n\ncompared with PUFAs which contains more unsaturated bonds.  \n\nThe colloidal phase contains C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:1 and C20:5 (Table 3.4). These support \n\nthat the EPA in both strains (N. oculata = 26.3%; P. tricronutum = 23.0%) can be separated and \n\noptimized for industrial scale production using LTPS. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFatty acids Hexane Colloidal \n\nC14:0 11.3 \u00b1 0.9 11.0 \n\nC16:0 36.4 \u00b1 1.1 16.9 \n\n?SFA 47.7 27.9 \n\nC16:1(n-6) 29.8 \u00b1 2.3 16.0 \n\nC18:1(n-9) 11.1 \u00b1 0.3 12.9 \n\n?MUFA 40.9 28.9 \n\nC18:2(n-6) 6.0 \u00b1 2.1 8.8 \n\nC20:4(n-6) 1.0 \u00b1 1.2 8.1 \n\nC20:5(n-3) 4.4 \u00b1 0.2 26.3 \n\n?PUFA 11.4 43.2 \n\n\n\n  \n\n47 \n \n\nTable 3.4.
