In \nBrazil, sorghum was re-introduced in 1970, specially in \nwestern zones of the South region. Sorghum areas were then \nexpanded, from the mid 1990\u2019s onwards, as an alternative to \nsoybean. The repercussion was so significant that the demand \nfor regular seed volumes stimulated producers, industry \nand researchers to work together in search for new hybrids \n(CONAB, 2004).\n\nSorghum grains should be harvested when moisture \ncontent is between 18 and 20%. Seeds within this moisture \nrange have to be dried in order to reduce moisture contents \nto values between 12 and 13%, since high moisture contents \nare the main reason behind losses in germination and vigor, \n(Mantovani, 2003). Natural or artificial drying methods may \nbe chosen, depending on characteristics of each species, \nthe amount of harvested seeds, and on weather conditions \nprevailing after seeds were harvested.\n\nNatural seed drying is directly dependent on weather \nconditions. The disadvantage of the method lies in the \nneed for intensive human labor, which in turn leads to poor \noperational performance. Nevertheless, whether conducted \ndirectly under de sun or in the shade, natural drying is very \nimportant in seed production, as it brings about consistent, \nhomogeneous post-harvest seed maturation (Berti et al., \n2005).\n\nArtificial drying methods are more often used, and \nare more easily adaptable to seed production techniques, \naffording fast and efficient removal of large amounts of \nmoisture (Carvalho, 1994). Mechanical drying techniques \nmay be used with the assistance of mechanical, electric or \nelectronic equipment, in which air is forced through the seed \nmass. These methods afford the maintenance of seed quality, \nwhen conducted under technical criteria that define exposure \ntimes and temperatures (Ahrens et al., 2000). According to \nCavarini et al. (1998), the main advantages of the artificial \nmethod are to allow the control of the temperature, the drying \nair flux, and the exposure time of the seeds to the heated air, \nfundamental factors to assure the efficiency of the process.\n\nSeveral factors have to be considered when choosing \nbetween seed drying methods. These aspects include seed \nvolumes effectively harvested, harvest speed, drying time, \nenergy consumption, end purpose of seeds, apart from \nhuman-related aspects like technological knowledge and \npurchase power of the producer. Nevertheless, the specific \ncharacteristics of each product harvested as seen in the light \nof the heat transfer technique adopted may determine the best \ndrying method to be used, with minimal damage to physical \n\nand physiological seed quality (Maia, 1995).\nThis study aimed to evaluate the performance of some \n\nseed drying methods in terms of physiological quality of \ngrain sorghum seeds.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nGrain sorghum seeds (cultivar DKB 599, Dekalb), were \nprovided by S\u00e3o Domingos Seed Commerce. Seeds were \nproduced in the Lago\u00e3o district, municipality of Pantano \nGrande, state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil, at 126 \nkm from Porto Alegre. The experiment comprised three \ndrying treatments: a) drying under natural conditions,  b) \nan intermittent dryer whose source of caloric energy was \nfirewood, and c) a stationary dryer provided  with a perforated \nbottom in which the source of caloric energy was petroleum \nliquefied gas.\n\nIn the natural drying method, sorghum seeds \nwere harvested on 03/17/2005 and transported to the \nAgrometeorological and Forage Crops Department of the \nFederal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). The \ndrying procedure started on the next day and lasted 7 days \n(56 h). Seed mass weight was 300 kg, with 18.9% baseline \nmoisture content. Seeds were initially sieved in a 4 mm mesh \nscreen and subsequently spread as five piles of 60 kg each, \nwith 10 cm thick layers spaced at 0.5m intervals under direct \nsunlight across an 8m2 concrete floor previously covered \nwith woven propylene bags. Exposure time was 8 h a day \nwith hourly upturns. Moisture measurements were carried \nout three times a day (at 9 am, 2 pm, and 5 pm) using a \ndigital grain moisture meter Multi Grain. The average solar \nradiation observed during the drying period, measured by the \nHydraulic Research Institute/UFRGS was 375.22 cal.cm-2.\nday-1. After reaching the final moisture content of 12.6%, 25 \n1.5 kg samples were collected, transferred to paper bags, and \nsent to the Seed Analysis Laboratory.\n\nIn the intermittent drying process, two driers of \nintermittent and slow seed flow (IMPASA 90) were used. \nThe static capacity of each drier was of 5,400 kg. The static \nload of the drying chamber (cross-flow, tray type) was of \n10,800 kg of seeds. Seeds were lifted in a 10 m high grain \nelevator equipped with scoops and driven by a 2 HP engine. \nThe system was supplied with a firewood combustion furnace \nand a 2,700 kg wooden bag silo. On 04/01/2005, 10,800 kg \nseeds with approximate of 18.1% moisture were harvested \nand sent to Engenho Moinhos, Pantano Grande, RS, where \nthe seeds were discharged into a hopper and transported by \nthe elevator to an air screen separator to reduce impurities \nas well as get some reduction in seed moisture content. \nAfter that, the seeds were transported to the drier previously \nadjusted to a 67 m3.min-1.ton-1 airflow, with initial air \n\n\n\n179DRYING OF GRAIN SORGHUM SEEDS\n\nRevista Brasileira de Sementes, vol. 30, n\u00ba 3, p.177-184, 2008\n\ntemperature of 50.3\u00b0C and maximum temperature of 60.3\u00b0C, \nand an intermittence ratio of 1:4. Temperature and relative \nhumidity were measured every hour with thermometers (rod \nand probe). Likewise, grain moisture content was monitored \nevery hour by digital grain moisture meter Multi Grain. \nWhen seeds reached the final moisture content of 12.3%, 25 \n1.5 kg samples were collected, transferred to paper bags, and \ntransported to the Seed Analysis Laboratory.\n\nThe stationary drying process used two driers \nmodels, both equipped with gas burners (Baron \u2013 circular; \nBandeirante \u2013 rectangular), each with a static load of 2,700 \nkg and a height of 1.50 m. The assembly operated in the \nPost Harvest Technology Center of de UFRGS, in the \nmunicipality of Eldorado do Sul, RS. On 05/03/2005, 5,400 \nkg of sorghum seeds with 18.2% of  moisture were harvested \nand, in the same day, transported to the driers. Because the \ndrying method was processed from the base to the surface \nof the seeds, three layers were formed: a layer with dried \nseeds (a), a transition layer (b),  and a layer with humid seeds \n(c). From each layer samples were collected and brought to \nthe Seed Analysis Laboratory. Temperatures and relative \nhumidities of the seed mass drying air flow were monitored \nwith a digital thermometer Dry Eration, with thermocouples \ninstalled in the holes on the sides of the drier and of the \nplenum. Seed moisture content was measured using the \ndigital grain moisture meter Multi Grain, at 1-h intervals \nthroughout the drying process (Table 4).\n\nDrying rate of seeds was calculated dividing the \npercentage of water removed from seeds by the hour count \nof the drying process. Drying curves were determined by \nadjusting the curve considering the change in seed moisture \n\ncontent and the length of the drying process.\nIn order to evaluate the physical and physiological quality \n\nof the seeds, the following tests were conducted: Moisture \ncontent - determined after the initial cleaning using a digital \nmeter Multi Grain Wild in 100-g samples analyzed in \ntriplicate, with results expressed in percentage; Purity test \n- conducted with 25 samples of each drying method, which \nwere sieved three times and forced through a seed blower for \n3 min (De Leo model South Dakota), with an opening set \nat 6.5 cm; Germination test - carried out over paper as 25 \nrepetitions of 100 seeds each, in square plastic containers (11 \nx 11 x 3 cm) placed in a germination chamber at a constant \ntemperature of 25\u00b0C, for 10 days. The results were expressed \nas percentage of normal seedlings (Brazil, 1992); Weight \nof 1000 seeds \u2013 it was determined by weighing 8 samples \nof 100 seeds retrieved from the mass of pure seeds from the \npurity analysis, according to Brazil (1992); first count - the \nrecord of the percentage of normal seedlings as determined \nfour days after the beginning of the test.\n\nThis experiment was set according to a completely \nrandom design. The data obtained were statistically analyzed \nby the Duncan test to compare means, at the 5% level of \nprobability.\n\nRESuLTS AND DIScuSSION\n\nThe moisture content: drying time ratio of sorghum seeds \nfor the three drying methods is represented by a quadratic \nfunction. Seed drying occurred at a decreasing ratio, growing \nslower with time (Figure 1).\n\nFIGURE 1. Curves representing moisture contents of grain sorghum seeds in terms of drying time: A) natural drying; \nB) stationary drying; C) intermittent drying.\n\n\n\n180 L. B. FRANKE et al.\n\nRevista Brasileira de Sementes, vol. 30, n\u00ba 3, p.177-184, 2008\n\nThe analysis of the drying curves illustrates that the \nremoval of moisture from seeds was slower in the natural \nmethod, and faster in the artificial drying methods (Figure 1). \nApart from the method, several other factors added to these \ndifferences, such as: exposure times to drying air (heated or \nnot), drying air temperature (high or low), relative humidity \nin the site (modified or not), drying air flow (natural or \nforced), and the speed with which moisture migrated from \nthe inner seed structures to its surface. These observations \nare in accordance with the studies by Teixeira et al. (1980). \nYet, Brooker et al. (1981) categorically state that drying \ndepends basically on relative humidity and on airflow.\n\nThe natural drying process was slower due to the \nlimitations the method imposes, with 56 h needed for the \nseeds to have their moisture reduced from 18.92% to 12.58% \n(7 days, 8h/day) (Figure 1, Table 1). The seeds averaged \na loss of approximately 0.11 pph-1 (0.90% per 8-h day) \n(Table 2), with drying speed totally dependent on weather \nconditions. In this drying treatment, moisture loss observed \nfrom the 1st to the 3rd day (24h, 8h/day) was considerable, \ndue to the more favorable weather conditions, but lesser \nfrom the 4th to the 7th day (32 h, 8h/day). For the first period, \nmean moisture loss was around 0.20pph-1, and for the second \nperiod 0.04pph-1. Generally speaking, temperature varied \nconsiderably throughout the day, and also during the whole \ndrying process. The fast initial desorption (up to the 3rd day) \nonly occurred at higher air temperatures (26.6\u00b0C on the \naverage), 65% relative humidity, and an airflow speed close \nto 2.47 m.s-1.  The low drying rate in natural drying process \nmay be harmful to the seeds. Under these drying conditions, \nmicroorganisms may develop, as moisture takes longer to \nbe removed, apart from the fact that seeds hold moisture for \nlonger than advisable. Thus, the seed mass temperature may \nchange, with acceleration in respiration which causes a CO2 \nrelease and water vapor, besides the consumption of reserves. \nThis may cause a significative decrease in the physiological \nquality of seeds, although this  was not verified in this work \n(Table 5).\n\nIn the intermittent drying method, the time needed to \nreduce seed moisture from 17.3% to 12.3% was of 4 h. This \nrepresented a mean moisture loss rate of 1.25 pph-1 (Tables 2 \nand 3). Seeds dried by the intermittent method lost moisture \nmore quickly than the other methods. This result may be \nexplained in the light of the combination of several factors: a) \nmethod used; b) shorter exposure time of seeds in the drying \nchamber and to air flow; c) adjustments in air temperature, in \nrelative humidity, and in air flow; d) synchronicity between \nexposure time inside the drying chamber and equalization \n\ntime (1:4); and e) uniformization and dissipation of heat inside \nthe bag silo. The initial drying temperature of 50.3\u00b0C was \nadjusted throughout the process, but never surpassed 60.3\u00b0C. \nThe temperature of the seed mass was around 43\u00b0C (Table \n3). The airflow, defined as 67 m3.min-1.ton-1 for each dryer, \nwas within the limits established by Millmann (2002) (32.84 \nm3.min-1.ton-1 and 72.44 m3.min-1.ton-1), which is enough to \nremove moisture from the system. The temperature rise in the \ndrying air diminished relative humidity, and thus increased \nthe capacity of the drying air to remove seed moisture when \nthe seed mass was exposed to insufflated air (cross-flow), \nwhich was subsequently removed from the system, almost \nsaturated with humidity. Intermittent drying allowed to adopt \nhigher air temperatures, as compared to the other methods, \nwithout excessively increasing the temperature of seeds due \nto the equalization period, as observed in our results (Table \n3). In this treatment, seed upturn greatly influenced drying \nspeed, and was intended to ensure that drying occurred \nevenly. This made easier the flow of the drying air against the \nlow static pressure, thus increasing drying speed, as verified \nby the decrease of 1 pp at every turn.\n\nIn stationary drying, the time needed to reduce moisture \nfrom 18.2% to 13.2% was 9 h (Tables 2 and 4). The seed \ntemperature was around 25\u00baC (beginning) and moisture \ncontent was 18.3%. After 5 h of drying, the seed mass \ntemperature was 47.1\u00baC and seed moisture content was 14%. \nAfter this period, the cooling process and the uniformization \nof moisture content by cross-flowing air was started and after \na 4 h period the seed temperature was 24.2\u00baC and moisture \ncontent was 13.1%.\n\nThe stationary drying method resulted in three different \nlayers, a, b, and c, that is, a layer with dried seeds, a transition \nlayer and a layer with humid seeds, respectively.  Drying \nspeed was higher in layer a, due to the fact that seeds were \ndirectly exposed for a longer period to the airflow, causing \na larger reduction in seeds moisture content. In the other \nlayers (b and c), the seeds final moisture content was higher, \nrequiring longer drying periods. Seed mass temperatures in \nthe layer a and in part of the transition zone were above the \nrecommended values (Table 4). These two layers are located \nnear the air inlet, and thus dry more quickly, showing the \nfastest desorption rates. Hence the importance of knowing \nthe maximum time span allowed for drying, to prevent \ntemperature from rising above recommended limits. The \nefficiency of this method depends on the duct architecture, \nthe air flux, and the physical characteristics of the protective \ncover of the seeds, the volume and architecture of the porous \nspaces and uniformity of the seed mass (Moraes, 2000).\n\n\n\n181DRYING OF GRAIN SORGHUM SEEDS\n\nRevista Brasileira de Sementes, vol. 30, n\u00ba 3, p.177-184, 2008\n\nTABLE 1.

Moisture content, purity,  germination, first count and weight of a thousand seeds (WTS) results of grain \nsorghum seeds submitted to three drying methods.\n\nMeans followed by the same letter in one column indicate values that do not differ statistically (Duncan test; P<0.05).\n\nThe natural drying method resulted in seed germination \nand vigor values lower than those observed when the drying \nmethod was the intermittent one (Table 5). In natural drying, \nthe factors that may have led to reductions in germination \nare thought to be more closely related to the method itself \nand to the influence of weather conditions. Apart from these, \nother aspects may have influenced the results, such as: a) the \nlow air flow (controlled by air speed),  b) the low heating \npower of the source,  c) the dissipation of the caloric energy \ndistributed across the system, which probably reduced \ndrying efficiency,  and d) the low drying speed may have \nmaintained the respiration rate at high levels. This takes up \nenergy reserves, and partly affects germination and vigor, \ndue to the fact that bound water remains for longer periods \ninside the seed, which in turn produces gases and vapor in the \nintergranular space. Periodic upturning of seeds helped tone \nthe situation down, as it homogenizes seeds and increases \nthe time seeds are exposed to the drying conditions. In spite \nof its limitations, natural drying is still widely adopted in \nagriculture for being cheaper, directly or indirectly, specially \nfor smaller seed volumes, as pointed out by Naum (2004). In \nthe state of Rio Grande do Sul, natural drying is extensively \nchosen to dry seeds of forage species, such as rye grass (Maia, \n1995), specially in times and places affected by sudden rains. \nDue to the low local heat capacity (375.22 cal.cm-2.day-1) and \nto the low drying speed under the natural drying conditions, \nseeds were not submitted to very high temperatures. So, \nseeds apparently did not suffer any physical damage, though \nthe drying method imposed a reasonable reduction in \ngermination rate and in vigor (physiological aspect) (Table \n5). Apart from this, the method is inadequate due to the \npsychrometric conditions of the air, which lead to longer \ndrying times, as observed in the present study.\n\nThe intermittent drying method resulted in seeds of \nhigher germination and vigor (Table 5). This is explained by \nseveral factors, such as: a) the conduction of a pre cleaning \nstage which consisted in the elimination of large sized inert \nmaterial and this resulted in a seed moisture drop of 1 pp,  \n\nb) the high drying air flow, which afforded higher moisture \nremoval rates,  c) lowest exposure time of seeds to air \ntemperature in the drying chamber,  d) good synchronicity \nbetween drying time and equalization, which increases drying \nspeed,  and e) seed upturn. As this method was designed to \neliminate part of the heat used together with the moisture and \nto release it out of the system, the physiological quality of \nseeds was not really diminished, as seeds are dried in a series \nof short drying times interrupted by longer resting times.\n\nIn terms of germination and vigor, the performance of \nthe stationary drying method was worse than that of the \nintermittent one, although it did not differ from the natural \ndrying (Table 5). Some factors may have contributed to \nthis result, such as: the absence of initial pre-cleaning; the \ndifficulty to remove moisture from the farthest layers (b and \nc), even at top air flow, due to the static pressure and to the \ncharacteristics of the sorghum seeds; seed mass remained \nexposed to drying air for too long, which led to overdrying \nof the (a) and (b) layers thus resulting in  lower germination \nrates and vigor. The low vigor value of these seeds may \nbe explained by the relationship between exposure time, \ntemperature, thickness of layers, and seed structure, all of \nwhich are aspects that led to losses in seed quality due to \ninjury. The interaction of these several factors contributed \nto the unevenness observed in drying speed inside the seed \nmass, which affected physiological quality and determined \nlower germination rate and lessened germination of seeds \n(first count). Specially in the (a) and (b) layers, the seed mass \ntemperatures maintained above 43 \u00b0C for 4 h have probably \nreduced the quality (impaired germination and vigor). This \nfinding confirms that it is not advisable to use values above \nthose recommended by research, though the germination test \ndid in fact produce satisfactory results.\n\nThe analysis of variance for the weight of 1000 seeds \nrevealed statistically significant differences (P<0.05) between \ndrying procedures. Natural drying of seeds resulted in lower \nweight, as compared to intermittent drying, but higher as \ncompared to stationary drying (Table 5).

B. FRANKE et al.\n\nRevista Brasileira de Sementes, vol. 30, n\u00ba 3, p.177-184, 2008\n\nseeds following stationary drying may be ascribed to the fact \nthat in this method seeds were more exposed to the flow or \ndrying air which led to overdrying and, as a result, to a higher \nenergy expenditure of the seed, seen in the uptake of energy \nreserves (Maia, 1995). Conversely, in the intermittent drying, \nthe higher weights observed are related to the intermittence \nratio, that is, the shorter exposure time in the drier coupled to \nthe longer equalization time.\n\nYet, the improved technical efficiency observed in \nthe three drying methods is related to practical issues and \navailability of use, to the adaptation of the method to the \ndrying process, and to the compatibility in terms of industrial \nautomation, as reported by Millman (2002).\n\nConsidering the importance of seed drying, alternative \ndrying methods should be the object of constant research. \nFor instance, the combination of the methods discussed, and \nthe replacement of expensive fuels by cheaper alternatives to \ndecrease environmental degradation, as well as improvements \nin the existing systems. These improvements are expected to \nincrease drying speed, reduction of drying costs and a more \nefficient conservation of environment resources.\n\nSeed drying is a complex subject, and very often \ndrying available facilities are those made possible by the \ncircumstances, not the ideal ones. In many cases, drying \nmethods are conducted outside the specifications defined, \nso that the seed treatment unit as a whole may maximize \nperformance, at minimal losses.\n\ncONcLuSIONS\n\nThe use of intermittent dryer method to dry sorghum \nseeds has afforded higher moisture removal in a shorter \nperiod of time, and resulted in seeds of higher germination \nand vigor.\n\nThe low drying speed of sorghum seeds as observed in \nnatural drying is influenced by the limitations imposed by the \nmethod, which led to slow desorption and determined a very \nlong drying curve, contributing to lower seeds physiological \nquality.\n\nThe used layer thickness, exposure time, and the air flow \nin the stationary dryer affect negatively the physiological \nquality of sorghum seeds, as compared to the intermittent \nmethod.\n\nREfERENcES\n\nAHRENS, D.C.; VILLELA, F.A.; DONI FILHO, L. \nQualidade fisiol\u00f3gica e industrial de sementes de aveia-\n\nbranca (Avena sativa) na secagem intermitente.
