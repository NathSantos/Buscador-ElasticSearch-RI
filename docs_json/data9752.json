Small villages around the mine site are \npresent, and the community living in these villages subsists, not only from the \nmining activity, but also from agriculture and cattle breading which justifi es the \nassessment of soil contamination around the Rio and Barroca Grande tailings \nand mud impoundments.\n\nThis study, developed on the context of Medical Geology, has as main goal \nto assess human health problems emerging from the contamination of soils, \nwaters, stream sediments, dusts and plants on the surroundings of the \nPanasqueira mine. The focus will be placed in the establishment of relationships \nbetween geochemical environment and the population health through the use of \ndispersion models and GIS based techniques in order to disclose a link between \nspatial distribution of the harmful elements and patterns of the corresponding \ndiseases that might occur or will be potentially induce by the local conditions.\n\nDetailed geochemical studies were performed, either in the contamination \nsource (tailings) and the surrounding environment, in order to access a better \nunderstanding of the dynamics inherent to leaching, transport, and accumulation \nof some potential toxic elements in soil and their environmental relevance. The \nmetal assemblage identifi ed in soils (Ag-As-Bi-Cd-Cu-W-Zn; PTE\u2019s) refl ects \nthe infl uence of the tailings and open impoundments materials, due to several \nagents including the wind dispersion and the subsequent deposition in soils. \nPTE\u2019s and pH presents positive correlation confi rming that heavy metal mobility \nholds a positive correlation with pH therefore affecting their availability.\n\nThe assessment of the extent of human exposure to metals in studied populations \nwas performed in order to identify the geological agents that might affect their \nhealth. In order to evaluate the effect of the external contamination on selected \nindexes of internal dose, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb e Zn were determined \nin blood, urine, hair and nail samples from individuals environmentally exposed. \nResults obtained agreed with those reported by environmental studies performed \nin this area, pointing to populations living nearby the mine exposed to metal(loid)\ns originated from mining activities. Arsenic was the element with the highest \nincrease in exposed populations. The concentration of other elements such as \nCr, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, and Zn was also increased, although at a lesser extent, \nspecifi cally in females. These fi ndings confi rm the need for competent authorities \nto act as soon as possible in this area and implement strategies aimed to protect \nexposed populations and the entire ecosystem\n\nAll the data was integrated with the objective to establish a methodology of \nrisk assessment. The combination of environmental and human biomonitoring \nstudies may synergistically increase the knowledge of toxic elements, which is \nessential to assess the potential risks to human health.\n\nkeywords\n\nabstract\n\n\n\n\n\nxvii\n\nContents\n\nList of fi gures ........................................................................................................................................ xxi\n\nList of tables .........................................................................................................................................xxv\n\nList of abreviations ............................................................................................................................... xxvii\n\nList of samples ....................................................................................................................................xxviii\n\nList of main chemical elements used ......................................................................................................xxviii\n\nList of Panasqueira minerals ................................................................................................................... xxix\n\nPart I - Approach ................................................................................................................................... 1\n1.

Introduction\n\nThe demand for ore comes from the beginning of mankind, being very important for human \nsurvival and development. Mining products are vital and indispensable to our modern society \nand contribute signifi cantly to our wealth, being a major economic activity in many developing \ncountries (Tauli-Corpuz, 1997; UNEP, 1997; Zobrist and Giger, 2013). Nevertheless mining \noperations, whether in small or large scale, routinely modify the surrounding landscape by \nexposing previously undisturbed earthen materials (Fig. 1.1; Makweba and Ndonde, 1994; \nZobrist and Giger, 2013). Ore exploitation, extraction and processing activities generate \nsubstantial amounts of solid and liquid wastes that can have deleterious impacts (UNEP, \n1997; BRGM, 2001; Stumbea, 2013; Ferreira da Silva et al., 2013). \n\nVirgin mine site\n(natural environment,\n\n geochemical\nbackground)\n\nOre\n\nMarket product\n\nMining\nTop soil, overburden,\n\nwaste rock and\ntemporary stockpile\n\nof ore\n\nTailings\nMud dams\n\nProcessed waste\nProcessing\n\nFig. 1.1. Mining waste types (adapted from BRGM, \n2001).\n\nEurope has an unquestionable importance in the world economy and mineral extraction plays \na vital role in the supply, as also in the consumption, of all groups of exploited minerals. \nAn European Commission (EU) study evaluated the lower limits of the amount of stored \nwaste rock in ten countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, \nIreland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom) as 4,700 Mt and the processing wastes \nor tailings as 1,200 Mt (BRGM, 2001; Zobrist and Giger, 2013). Mining wastes contain toxic \nchemicals and represent a long-term risk to the surrounding environment and to mankind, \nonce they might migrate into human exposure pathways (Kossoff et al., 2012; Stumbea, 2013; \nCaravanos et al., 2013). The extraction of metals from sulfi de minerals results in mine wastes\ncontaining high concentrations of potentially toxic elements (PTE; e.g. As, Cu, Zn, Cd; see \nsection 12.1). When these wastes are left in the vicinity of sensitive locations constitute one of \nthe greatest threats both for the environment and human health (Moore and Luoma, 1990; \nBoulet and Larocque, 1998; Jung, 2001; Naicker et al., 2003). \n\nThe purposes of environmental analysis are the determination of the background (Bk) and \nnatural concentrations of the environment chemicals constituents (background monitoring) \nand the estimation of the harmful pollutants concentration in the environment \u2013 pollution \nmonitoring (Radojevic and Bashkin, 2006). Is important to recognize several parameters: (a) \n\n\n\n4 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\nclimatic conditions; (b) geographic and geological framing; (c) existing targets liable to be \naffected \u2013 man and his environment; (d) the chemical and mineralogical composition of the \nwastes; (e) the physical properties of the facilities/tailings; (f) the volume and surface occupied \nby wastes; and (g) the waste disposal methods (BRGM, 2001).\n\nMedical geology (MG), an emerging scientifi c scope, studies the impact of geologic \nmaterials, both in ecosystems and in human health. Some MG studies can be found, related \nwith the exposition and associated risk of populations that live in the surrounding of mines \n(environmental exposure). The research on occupational exposure showed that cancer is one \nof the most serious risk, once workers may develop the disease many years after the exposure \n(Stephens and Ahern, 2001). Bunnell (2004), referring to the recommendations of the MG task \nforce, states that there is an urgency of detailed studies, as well as their quality improvement \nand connection between geological and medical data. Although MG is still recent, there are \nsome pioneer works, especially in mining areas: (a) in Lavrion (Greece), there was established \nthe correlation between soil metals content and cancer risk on miners (Karachaliou et al., \n2007); (b) the Iron Quadrangle (Brazil) presented high positive correlation between the As \nresults in urine and the As soils content (Matschullat et al., 2000; Figueiredo et al., 2004, \n2007); (c) studies in Almad\u00e9n (Spain) and Terlingua (USA) indicate that the calcination of Hg \nmine waste may lead to increased Hg concentrations in the human body, especially through \nthe ingestion pathway (Gray et al., 2004, 2010); (d) in Baia Mare (Romania) the studies showed \nsome correlation between mine dusts and chronic respiratory diseases of the populations \n(Popescu et al., 2003, 2004); (e) in northern Tanzania the studies allowed to conclude that the \nrisk of Hg contamination in miners is very high (Straaten, 2000); (f) in south China heavy metal \n(HM) contamination of food crops grown around the Dabaoshan mine posed a great health \nrisk to the local population through consumption of rice and vegetables (Zhuang et al., 2009); \n(g) in Korea the populations living on the surroundings of an Au-Ag abandoned mine present \na probable possibility of about 3 cancer patients by each 1,000 people, a carcinogenic risk \nexceeding the acceptable (Lim et al., 2008); and (h) in a gold mine (China) the farmland topsoil \nis contaminated in different levels (Yang et al., 2013).\n\nLand pollution due to mining activities is a major issue in many countries and Portugal is no \nexception (Santos Oliveira and \u00c1vila, 1995, 2003; Valente and Leal Gomes, 1998; Santos \nOliveira el al., 2002; Antunes et al., 2002; Pinto et al., 2004; \u00c1vila et al., 2005, 2008a; Bobos \net al., 2006; Lu\u00eds et al., 2009; Carvalho et al., 2009, 2012; Gomes et al., 2010; Grangeia et al., \n2011; Candeias et al., 2011a, b; Ferreira da Silva et al., 2005, 2013). Portugal holds a rich and \ncomplex geology, which gives a considerable mineral potential that resulted in a long mining \nhistory and legacy. \n\nThis thesis, developed on the scope of Medical Geology, is focused in Panasqueira mine \n(W\u2013Sn; central Portugal), a location chosen due to its past and present activity \u2013 in labor for \nover 110 years; by the existence of small villages near the mine site, which depend of the land \nand water use (water supply, agriculture, husbandry, fi shing and silviculture) and also by the \npresence of the Z\u00eazere river (\u00c1vila et al., 2008a).\n\nThe Panasqueira deposit contains signifi cant amounts of wolframite, arsenopyrite, cassiterite \nand chalcopyrite (Thadeu, 1951) and is considered the biggest W\u2013Sn deposit of the Western \nEurope. The ore deposit of Panasqueira is a classic example of postmagmatic ore classifi ed \nas a hydrothermal mineralization associated to the Hercynian plutonism, with unusually large \nsize crystals (Kelly and Rey, 1979; e-Ecorisk, 2007).\n\nThe long history of exploitation and ore treatment operations in the Panasqueira mine are \ntestifi ed by the presence of huge tailings and other debris. The piles (Rio tailing ~1.2 Mm3; \n\n\n\n5Part I \u2013 Approach\n1. Introduction\n\nBarroca Grande tailing ~7.0 Mm3) and the open air impoundments (Rio mud dam ~0.7 Mm3; \nBarroca Grande with two mud dams ~1.2 Mm3) are exposed to the atmospheric conditions, \nbeing altered by chemical, mineralogical, physical and geotechnical causes. On the top of \nthe Rio tailing, an arsenopyrite stockpile (~9,400 m3) was deposited and remained exposed \nuntil June 2006 when was capped with geotextile and layers of clay (e-Ecorisk, 2007). Rio \ntailing is located on the left bank of the Z\u00eazere river, the main watercourse of the area, that \nfeeds Castelo de Bode dam (located 90 km downstream Rio tailing), which is the main water \nsupplier of Lisbon, where about 1/3 of the Portuguese population lives and works.\n\nUnderstanding the geochemical processes which control precipitation and dissolution \nof secondary minerals in abandoned sulfi de mines is crucial for the elaboration of models \nwhich predict the environmental impact of such sites (Gier\u00e9 et al., 2003). Metals/metalloids \ncan be dispersed downstream due to the weathering and erosion processes of the tailings. \nThus, the extent and degree of HM contamination around the mines varies depending upon \ngeochemical characteristics and mineralization of the tailings. High concentrations of HM\u2019s \ncan be found in and around abandoned and active mines due to the discharge and dispersion \nof mine waste materials into nearby soils, food crops and stream sediments (Lee et al., 2001; \nJung, 2001; McKenzie and Pulford, 2002; Witte et al., 2004). This will \u201ceventually\u201d lead to \na loss of biodiversity, amenity, and economic well-being, posing a potential health risk to \nresidents in the vicinity of the mining areas (Verner and Ramsey, 1996; Lee et al., 2001; Wong \net al., 2002; Gal\u00e1n et al., 2003). \n\nThe effect of Panasqueira mining activities and the metals release from acid mine waters to \nwater courses is dynamic and actual (e-Ecorisk 2007; \u00c1vila et al., 2008a,b; Ferreira da Silva \net al., 2013 in section 12.5; Coelho et al., 2013 in section 12.5). Percolation of rain waters is \nresponsible by the tailings slag dissolution, resulting in acid mine drainage (AMD). This may \nbe a serious threat to the surrounding populations (Barroca and S. Francisco de Assis (SFA); \nFig. 2.1).\n\nAMD is a well-known international environmental problem related with both ongoing and \nabandoned mining operations. The generation and discharge of AMD with low pH and \ncontaining high concentrations of dissolved metals and metalloids may seriously disturb the \nwater quality. The key to understand mining effects depends directly on understanding the \nprocesses that produce AMD. Sulfi de waste materials when exposed to air and water, give \nrise to the oxidation of metals, through chemical, electrochemical, and biological reactions, \nforming ferric hydroxides and sulfuric acid and leading to the generation of acid mine \ndrainage with high contents of metals and sulfates, related to the sulfi des alteration, and \nwhose equilibrium only depends on its solubility (Cohen and Gorman, 1991; Merson, 1992; \nEvangelou and Zhang, 1995; Larocque and Rasmussen, 1998; Soucek et al., 2000; Blowes \net al., 2003; Nieto et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2013). Additionally erosion of exposed soils, \nextracted mineral ores, tailings, and fi ne material in waste rock piles can result in substantial \nsediment loadings to surface waters and drainage routes.\n\nSoil is not only a part of the ecosystem but also plays a basic role for humans, since the \nsurvival of mankind is tied to the maintenance of its productivity (Kabata-Pendias and \nMukherjee, 2007). As a direct result of the mining activities soils are, generally, disturbed over \nconsiderable areas. Human health and environmental risks from soils generally fall in two \ncategories: (1) soil contaminated from chemical spills and residues; and (2) contaminated soil \nresulting from windblown dust (Ettler et al., 2005, 2009, 2011, 2012; K\u00edbek et al., 2010; \u0160r\u00e1ek \net al., 2010; V\u00edtkov\u00e1 et al., 2010). Fugitive dust can pose signifi cant environmental problems \n\n\n\n6 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\nat some mines. Tailings in particular can be a potent source of fi ne particulates. The inherent \ntoxicity of the dusts depends upon the proximity of environmental receptors and type of ore \nbeing mined. High levels of As, Pb, and radionuclides in windblown dust usually pose the\ngreatest risk. \n\nThe soil fi ne fraction is usually enriched in metals, due to the relative large surface area of \nfi ne particles for adsorption and due to metal binding to iron and manganese oxides and to \norganic matter (Rasmussen, 1998; Yukselen and Alpaslan, 2001). The sorption-desorption soils \ncharacteristics generally take control of the mobility and availability of HM\u2019s (Krishnamurti et \nal., 1999). Heavy metal availability in soils depends on their parameters, being among them the \nsoil organic matter (SOM) and pH (Antoniadis et al., 2008). Soil pH was found to play the most \nimportant role in determining metal speciation, solubility from mineral surfaces, movement \nand bioavailability of metals due to the strong effects on solubility and speciation of metals \nin soils (M\u00fchlbachov\u00e1 et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2010; Zeng et al., 2011). Several laboratory \nexperiments have shown that HM mobility and availability have a negative correlation with pH \n(Sukreeyapongse et al., 2002) Also Oliver et al. (1996), Braillier et al. (2006) and Du Laing et \nal. (2007) revealed that metal mobility and availability increases with the decrease of soil pH, \nthus enhancing the uptake of HM\u2019s by plants and thereby posing a threat to human health \n(Zeng et al., 2011).\n\nHuman exposure to hazardous elements may have different pathways, through the ingestion \nof plants for human consumption cultivated on the contaminated soils and/or through dusts \ninhalation/ingestion, being especially important in children by the hand-to-mouth practices. \nSoils contaminated with chemical spills and residues at mine sites may pose a direct contact \nrisk when misused as fi ll materials, ornamental landscaping, and/or soil supplements. \nAccording to several authors (Chen et al., 1997; Bosso and Enzweiler, 2008; Douay et al., \n2008a; Roussel et al., 2010; Juhasz et al., 2011; Ettler et al., 2012) the studies dealing with the \nbioavailability and bioaccessibility of metals/metalloids contaminants in highly-polluted soils \nare extremely useful to understand the possible effect on biota, and particularly on human \nhealth due to the exposure to those contaminants (Bosso and Enzweiler, 2008; Douay et al., \n2008b; Chen et al., 2009; Banza et al., 2009; Roussel et al., 2010; Juhasz et al., 2011; Ettler \net al., 2012;). \n\nExposure to increasing amounts of metals and metalloids in environmental and occupational \nsettings is a reality worldwide, though with different contours, affecting a signifi cant number \nof individuals. Most metals and metalloids are very toxic to living organisms and even those \nconsidered as essential can be toxic when in excess. They can disturb important biochemical \nprocesses, constituting an important threat for human health. Major health effects include \ndevelopment retardation, endocrine disruption, kidney damage, immunological and neurologic \neffects, and several types of cancer (Mudgal et al. 2010). It is useful the identifi cation of the \npotential threats to human health and natural ecosystems (Radojevic and Bashkin, 2006). It \nis also essential the quantifi cation of all the types of risks and the determination of the total \nrisk of the exposed populations through oral intake, inhalation and dermal contact of metal/\nmetalloids (USDoE, 2013). Risk assessment is typically a multistep process of identifying, \ndefi ning, and characterizing potentially adverse consequences of exposure to hazardous \nmaterials (USDoE, 2013). According to the Toxic Substances Portal (http://www.atsdr.cdc.\ngov/, 2013) Ag, As, Cd, Cu, W and Zn are known to be toxic to humans, being arsenic and \ncadmium classifi ed as human carcinogens. Some studies also considerer that Bi causes \nacute toxicity (WHO, 2013; DACAE, 2007).\n\n\n\n7Part I \u2013 Approach\n1.

Francisco de Assis, Barroca Grande, Dornelas \ndo Z\u00eazere, Barroca and S. Martinho villages (Fig. 2.1). The area was selected aiming to \ndetermine the environmental impacts and human health risk on the surrounding populations \nof the Panasqueira mine (Sn-W). The Panasqueira mine, active for over 110 years, is located \nin Central Portugal (Castelo Branco and Coimbra districts) approximately 300 km NE from \nLisbon, 200 km SE from Porto and 35 km W from Fund\u00e3o (Fig. 2.1a to c). The Panasqueira \nmining concession occupies an area of ~21 km2, being in Barroca Grande village (Table\n2.1; Fig. 2.1d) where the mining facilities and offi ces are currently located. In addition Casegas \n(NE from Panasqueira) and Unhais-o-Velho (W of the mine) villages were considered as \nbackground areas, due to their location (section 12.2) and prevailing wind direction (NW\u2013SE; \nFig. 2.1e).\n\nTable 2.1.

Geomorphology\n\nThe study area is located between the S. Pedro de A\u00e7or, Estrela and Gardunha mountain ranges, \nW from the Cova da Beira central Portuguese depression, 20 km SW from Serra da Estrela, the \nhighest mountain of Portugal mainland (1,993 m high). The Panasqueira region presents an \nirregular topography with steep slopes (some with ?40%) characterized by a compact valley \nsystem combined with several water streams which most of them are dried, except during the\nrainfall season.\n\nIn particular, the study area ranges in altitude between 350 m (SE of the mine) to 1,083 m (on \nthe NW corner of the mining concession), with an average altitude of 700 m (Reis, 1971). \n\n2.4. Geological framing\n\nGeologically Portugal is divided in two major sets, the Hesperian Massif (HMf) and the \nEpi-Hercynian. The fi rst can be separated in subsections (Fig. 2.1a): (a) the Galicia \u2013 Tr\u00e1s-os-\nMontes Zone; (b) the Central Iberian Zone (CIZ); (c) the Ossa-Morena Zone; and (d) the South \nPortuguese Zone. The Panasqueira mine is located in the CIZ, one of the most important \nEuropean metalogenic regions.\n\nThe geology of the Panasqueira mining area has been studied by numerous authors (e.g. \nThadeu, 1951; Bloot and De wolf, 1953; Clark, 1964, 1970, 1994; D\u2019Orey, 1967; Marignac, \n1973; Kelly and Rye, 1979; Bussink, 1984; Polya, 1987, 1988, 1989; Polya et al., 2000; \nFoxford et al., 1991; Noronha et al., 1992, 1999; Louren\u00e7o, 2002, 2006; Cavey and Gunning, \n2006; e-Ecorisk, 2007; \u00c1vila et al., 2008a). There are also geological data available in several \nunpublished reports requested by the mining companies during the pastyears.\n\nThe predominant country rock of the Panasqueira area consists on a folded metasedimentary \nsequence, the Beira Schists formation (BSF), a several thousand meters thick sequence \nof fl ysch-type units primarily composed of graywackes and shales (Pre-Cambrian to \nCarboniferous; Thadeu, 1951; Kelly and Rey, 1979; Sousa, 1985; Foxford et al., 1991).\n\n\n\n11Part I \u2013 Approach\n2.

Geological cut of panel 4 of level 2 in Barroca Grande mine where is possible to observe the magmatic \nintrusion (adapted from Thadeu, 1951 and Jaques Ribeiro and Gon\u00e7alves, 2013).\n\nThis greisened cupola is composed of about 40% of muscovite and 60% of quartz (Bussink, \n1984). The joint systems produced during the HO activities controlled the emplacement of \nthis post-tectonic granite batholith, which forms part of the southern fl ank of the Hercynian \ngranitic complex from northern Portugal. Authors attribute to this granitic intrusion the main \nsource of the mineralized fl uids responsible for the wolframite veins system (Thadeu, 1951; \nFoxford et al. 1991; Polya et al., 2000). According to Kelly and Rye (1979) the morphology \nof the Panasqueira ore veins suggests a primarily dilatational structure formed by the strong \nintrusion pressure of fl uids due to the crystallization of the granite mass and the volatiles\nrelease (Foxford et al., 1991). An older batholith, located E, present an intrusive sin-late \ntectonic and thought to be responsible by the barren quartz lenses, that rarely exceed 1 m in \nlength (D\u2019Orey, 1967).\n\nDrilling holes on the lower fl anks of the granite cupola suggest that it may send out several \nsill-like apophyses toward its base, where it ultimately fl ares out into a larger underlying mass \n(Kelly and Rye, 1979). Above the greisened cupola a silica cap takes place (~14 m thick and \n53 x 73 m in plan) with sharp contacts with the schists and the underlying granite, composed \n\nThe Panasqueira district was affected by the Caledonian (CO), Hercynian (HO) and Alpine (AO) \norogenies. During the CO the BSF was warped into gentle folds with predominant trending \naxes NNE and ENE (Thadeu, 1951; Kelly and Rey, 1979). During the early compressive stages \nof the HO the same rocks were regionally metamorphosed and compressed, subjected \nto low-grade metamorphism (greenschist facies with chlorite-sericite; late Precambrian to \nCambrian) and compressed into a series of moderately tight NW trending folds (Kelly and \nRey, 1979). The strong compression towards the close of the HO is considered responsible for \nthe schistosity and the system of faults of the Beira series, near vertical and with NE trending \nfoliation (Thadeu, 1951; Kelly and Rey, 1979). The numerous faults with NE\u2013SW (for example \nthe Cebola fault, located NW from the mine, and the 8E fault) and N\u2013S directions existing \non the Panasqueira mining district are considered as a consequence of the AO (Reis, 1971). \nThese are not related with the mineralized veins associated to the previous HO activities. The \njoint system linked to the AO is fi lled with gouge or carbonates and disseminated sulfi des \n(Bloot and De Wolf, 1953; D\u2019Orey, 1967).\n\nThe intrusive rocks are an important feature of the Panasqueira mineralization. Although \nno granite crops out the district, in 1948, the underground works exposed a blind granite\ngreisened cupola (200 m depth) on the Barroca Grande section (Figs. 2.1 and 2.2; Thadeu, \n1951; Clark, 1964; Kelly and Rye, 1979; Bussink, 1984).\n\nExocontact area with porphyroblasts of biotite-cordierite\n\n900\n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\nNE\n\n[m]\n\nSW\n\nSn-W\n\nSn-W\n\nW\nW\n\nSn-W\n\nSn-W\n\nW\n\nW\n\nSn-W\n\nW\n\nPelites, sandstone, greywackes and quartzites\nSn-W\n\nW Wolframite and cassiterite-wolframite areas Faults\nGreisenized granite Veins\nGranite\n\nDolerite diques\n\n0 500m\n\nSilica cap\n\n\n\n14 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\nmainly of coarse, milky quartz with smaller amounts of muscovite and occasional patches of \nwolframite, arsenopyrite and other trace minerals. This silica cap appears to be a hydrothermal \nfi lling with mineralogy essentially of a submarginal ore, not a magmatic or metasomatic body \n(Kelly and Rye, 1979).\n\nAlthough the extent of the granite body is still unknown drill hole data suggests that in the \nimmediate vicinity of the Barroca Grande mine, the upper granite surface, formed at least by one \ncupola, has approximately 1 km wide, NW trending ridge, sinking SE parallel to the emerging \nspotted argillaceous shales (Hebblethwaite and Antao, 1982; Polya, 1987). The extension of \nthe ridge over a distance of at least 5 km is inferred from the surface distribution of contact \nmetamorphosed schists (Polya, 1988). This granite, that suffered extensive hydrothermal \nalteration, shows an unbroken crystallization sequence from magmatic, through endoblastic \n(two-mica with K-feldspar mega crystals up to 1 cm or more size), to hydrothermal conditions \n(Clark, 1964). The granite loses is porphyritic texture upward, grading into an equigranular, \nmedium-grained greisen, altered to a quartz+muscovite+albite\u00b1topaz assemblage with \naccessory wolframite, cassiterite and sulfi des (Polya, 1988). Polya (1988) reported the studies \nof Kelly and Rye (1979) and Bussink (1984) determining high initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios of around \n0.713, with peraluminous composition and normative corundum, allowing to be classifi ed, \naccording to the Chappell and White (1974) terminology, as a S-type granite.\n\nAccording to Thadeu (1951) and Kelly and Rye (1979) this granite was intruded after the main \ncompressive stage of the HO. Clark (1970) dated the Panasqueira granite muscovite, from \nthe crosscutting mineralized veins, by the potassium-argon technique, with 289 to 290\u00b110 \nmillions of years (My), confi rming the HO age of this cupola (Kelly and Rye, 1979). Arthaud \nand Matte (1975) dated the granite, by the Rb\u2013Sr method, with 289\u00b14 My, while the fractures \nepisodes of the Beiras region were developed 310\u2013270 My ago (Cavey and Gunning, 2006). \nThis conclusions are coherent with the studies performed by Marques et al. (2002), dating the \nfaults set, by the K\u2013Ar techniques applied to the muscovite, with 312 My. \n\nThe regional metamorphism converted the thinner sediments in biotite-chlorite shales and \nfi lites and the more arenaceous units in dark, fi ne-grained quartzites. In BSF occurs several \npods, lenses and small vein masses of white barren quartz without wolframite but with minor \nchalcopyrite, galena and pyrite (Thadeu, 1951; D\u2019orey, 1967; Jaques and Gon\u00e7alves, 2013). \nThose were probably sweated out by the time of regional metamorphism. These quartz masses, \nknown as \u201cseixo bravo\u201d, are commonly aligned with the vertical foliation being crosscut by the \nlater mineralized veins (Thadeu, 1951; Kelly and Rey, 1979).\n\nThe basic igneous rock dikes are commonly found on the underground works. The dolerite \ndikes that may occupy the original existent faults, vertical to sub-vertical and striking N\u2013S, \nwith lengths up to 1 km and thickness ranging 0.5 to 3 m, being the majority ranging 1 to 1.5 \nm. The rock is fi ne to very fi ne grained, with dark grey color, with a sub-concoidal fracture, \nchiefl y composed of labradorite and amphibolitized pyroxene. Thadeu (1951) associated this \ndolerite dikes with the CO decompression stage, once are cut by the mineralized vein system \nand have no infl uence on the mineralization. Later, Thadeu (1977) attributed to these dikes \na late Hercynian age, once they are undeformed and apparently unaffected by the regional \nmetamorphism and yet altered by a metamorphism contact, associated with the granite \nemplacement (Kelly and Rye, 1979).\n\nBefore the discovery of the Panasqueira granite cupola a set of thin, commonly greisenized \naplitic dikes were found (Barbosa, 1944). These acid rocks, younger than the hydrothermal \n\n\n\n15Part I \u2013 Approach\n2. The study area\n\nore veins but older than the dolerite dikes, are considered as penecontemporaneous with the \ncupola, due to their mineralogical and textural similarity (Thadeu, 1951).\n\nThe emplacement of the Hercynian batholith leads to thermal contact metamorphism, \nproducing an aureole of spotting on the schists. According to D\u2019orey (1967) the spots were \ncaused by the clotty development of incipient chlorite, biotite, chiastolite and cordierite. Better \ndefi ned elliptical spots, composed by biotite and chlorite, are found in the more argillaceous \nshales (see section 12.3). The evidence of contact metamorphism on the spotted argillaceous \nshales veins confi rms the existence of two basic fl ows in the HMf, one earlier and one later \nthe Hercynian granitization (Thadeu, 1951; Silva and Baranda, 1997). \n\nSeveral authors studied the country rock near the veins and all agree with the tourmalinization, \nwith or without sericitization or silifi cation plus apatite and minor sulfi des, on the rock along \nthe sides of the veins, as a result of wall rock alteration. This common border of the veins \nnear the cupola, ranging from few centimeters to 15 cm thick, rich in tourmaline, gives place \nto more abundant sericite and/or quartz far from the cupola (Thadeu, 1951; Clark, 1964; \nKelly and Rey, 1979). Also apatite was found in the rock as a result of the wall rock alteration, \nbut only appears occasionally (D\u2019Orey, 1967). According to Clark (1964) the mineralization \nis considered to have been the immediate result of the gresenization and silifi cation of the \nparent granite. The veins internal fabric and contact associations indicate the formation of the \ninternal material by open-space fi lling, not by replacement processes (Kelly and Rye, 1979). \nThe composition of the arsenopyrite, blende and pyrrhotite in the apical zone of the granite \nsuggest the intrusion at ~700 \u00baC under a confi ning pressure of 500\u20131000 bars (Clark, 1964).\n\nAccording to the studies developed by Thadeu (1951), confi rmed by Jaques and Gon\u00e7alves \n(2013), the study area of the present work is divided in three general geological sets: (a) the \nspotted argillaceous shales; (b) the argillaceous shales and quartzites; and (c) argillaceous \nshales, quartzite and conglomerates (Fig. 2.1).\n\n2.4.1. Panasqueira mineralization\n\nThe ore deposit consists on several of near-horizontal hydrothermal quartz veins (Fig. 2.3), \nsharply crosscutting the steep bedding and schistosity of the host rock and the Panasqueira \ngranite cupola (Kelly and Rey, 1979), with three main directions: (a) NW\u2013SE direction, and \ndipping 10\u00ba SW, locally known as \u201cnormal veins\u201d; (b) direction SW\u2013NE dipping 6\u20139\u00ba SE, known \nas the \u201cwestern veins\u201d; and (c) a less important system, the \u201cfi l\u00f5es Galo\u201d, dipping 30\u201350\u00ba \nSE and striking SW\u2013NE, located in the east part of Barroca Grande section, connecting the \n\nFig. 2.3.

According to Jones (1937) differential \nstrains gave rise to the infl exion being relatively tight; the greater the warping the tighter \nthe infl exion, unless the strains were relieved by fracturing. Such fracturing may explain the \noccasional steeper \u201cGalo\u201d system (D\u2019Orey, 1967).\n\nThe Panasqueira deposit is estimated with approximately 2500 m in length by a variable \nwidth of 400 to 2200 m, continuing 500 m in depth (Cavey and Gunning, 2006). Hundreds \nof fl at veins are known, with lengths up to 200 m or reduced to only 2 m, with more or \nless uniform thickness, from millimeters up to 1.5 m (Bussink, 1984) crosscutting the steep \nbedding and foliation of the country rocks (Kelly and Rye, 1979). The economic veins are \nvertically separated by intervals of schists containing numerous unopened and unmineralized \njoints of the same set. These mineralized quartz veins are usually wedge out as \u201ceel-tails\u201d (Fig. \n2.4) sometimes converging to each other or fi nishing as long and straight quartz and mica \nstrings (Kelly and Rye, 1979).\n\nA general summary of the deposit formation was described by Breiter (2001): (a) intrusion and \nbuilding of the granite dome causing some intersections where the residual magma intrudes; \n(b) fl uids ascension to the roof from the deeper part of the granite pluton and after into some of \nthe non-opened joints \u2013 the fl uids greisenized the interior of the granite dome and some of the \ngranite sills; and (c) after opening the major number of the fl at joints, fl uids migrated outside \nthe granite building the subhorizontal ore veins. The spatial distribution of the mineralized \nveins occurs as traced by Thadeu (1951; Fig. 2.1). Snee et al. (1988) used muscovite selvages \nthat occur as vein precipitates, with accurate 40Ar/39Ar age dating techniques. The results \naged the veins between 296 to 274 My, whereas muscovite of the greisen cupola was aged \n292 My (Foxford et al., 1991).\n\nThe paragenesis of the Panasqueira mineralized veins is complex due to four main factors: \n(a) several minerals (i.e. muscovite, quartz and pyrite) were already in the sequence and \nprecipitated in a recurrent form; (b) the repetition may be simple, e.g. a hand specimen of \nhomogeneous quartz could present a very complex internal form with microscopic inclusions \nof several minerals in different moments; (c) no single mineral or event of the paragenesis is \ncompletely reliable as a positive time marker; and (d) the large extent, discontinuous access \nand complex geometry of the veins turns diffi cult to establish the physical continuity of a given \nmineral over large distances (Kelly and Rye, 1979). The differences between the paragenetic \nexplanations, with different consecutive stages of mineral deposition, might be explained by \nthese conditions. Nevertheless, four phases of mineral formation are generally accepted by \nthe majority of the authors that studied the deposit. Kelly and Rye (1979) and Correia and \nNaique (1998) described the paragenesis, subscribed by Banks et al. (1999) and Breiter (2001) \n(Table 2.4; Fig. 2.5).\n\nTable 2.4.

Paragenesis of the mineralized ore veins (roman digits identify multiple generations of a given mineral; \nadapted from Kelly and Rye, 1979).\n\nThe most economically important phase is the oxide-silicate stage due to the wolframite \nand cassiterite formation. Furthermore, it occurs the formation of almost all quartz (90% of \nthe vein matter), muscovite (that locally line the vein walls), tourmaline, topaz and most of \narsenopyrite, molybdenum, bismuth and the new phosphates recognized in Panasqueira \nmine (Kelly and Rye, 1979). According to Polya (1988) the major elemental chemistry of the \nBarroca Grande section wolframite is uniform, reproducing the uniform chemical composition \nof the ore forming fl uids from the main period. The second stage started by the late pulse \nof arsenopyrite deposition and is characterized by the deposition of pyrite (I), pyrrhotite, \nchalcopyrite (I), sphalerite (I), minor stannite and rare galena. The sphalerite was originally an \niron-rich (Zn,Fe,Cu,Sn)S solid solution which later exsolved variable amounts of chalcopyrite, \nstannite and pyrrhotite. The sulfi des of this stage were formed both by open-space fi lling \nand by replacement of minerals from the preceding stage (Kelly and Rye, 1979). The third \nstage is characterized by the pyrrhotite alteration, the formation of pyrite, marcasite and, \nmainly siderite. Pyrrhotite shows all forms of pseudomorphism by attack of marcasite and \npyrite (II). Minor amounts of stannite (II) and galena (II) were formed during this strong siderite \ndevelopment period, and noticeable amounts of chalcopyrite. The chalcopyrite (II) differs from \nthe material of the main sulfi de stage (Kelly and Rye, 1979). Other minerals also occur in minor \namounts. During the late carbonate phase the end of the Hercynian mineralized deposition \nis characterized by the formation of carbonates, mostly calcite and dolomite. This last one is \na combination of crystals with siderite nucleus and fl uorite. Calcite was the latest mineral to \nform in a signifi cant amount. The persistent sulfi de minerals continued to precipitate in small \nquantities during this stage, being several generations recognized in the underground works \n(Kelly and Rye, 1979; Silva and Rebollar, 1997). Thadeu (1951) proposed a division of the \nmineralized areas of the Panasqueira mining site, based on is local geology knowledge, veins \nsets system and major joints (Fig. 2.1d). \n\nTo date sixty fi ve minerals were identifi ed in the Panasqueira deposit, from which around \ntwenty are commonly found in underground works (Table 2.5).

Their conclusions for the Barroca Grande section are described as follows.\n\nThe quartz fi lling (SiO\n2\n; ~90% of the vein matter) of the mineralized veins is essentially milky \n\nand dense, presenting euhedra martite on the center vein. Veins with cassiterite present \n\n\n\n19Part I \u2013 Approach\n2. The study area\n\nFig. 2.6. Panasqueira cassi-\nterite with quartz and \nmuscovite. (source: \nhttp://hyperphysics.\nedu/, 2013).\n\nquartz less milky, being sometimes almost hyaline. Cassiterite (SnO\n2\n; Fig. 2.6) is typically \n\nwell crystallized and occurs near the top and bottom walls of the veins. Cassiterite euhedra \nis a primary mineral, existing also secondary cassiterite at the upper exploration levels of \nBarroca Grande section, as a result of the stannite breakdown. The cassiterite content in the \nore-bearing quartz veins tends to increase with depth and towards the greisened cupola. This \nmineral is often associated with minor muscovite crystals, rutile and wolframite.\n\nFig. 2.7. Panasqueira wolframite: (a) Flat lying white quartz veins along the \nwall of a stope with abundant black crystalline wolframite. The vein is \napproximately one meter wide at its thickness; and (b) detail of wolframite \ncrystals in a quartz vein (source: Cavey and Gunning, 2006).\n\nFig. 2.8. (a) Arsenopyrite (source: http://www.mineral-forum.com/, 2013); and (b) Chalcopyrite mineral; both from \nPanasqueira mine (source: http://www.dakotamatrix.com/, 2013).\n\nWolframite minerals ((Mn,Fe) WO\n4\n) occur as black blades up to 15 cm long, frequently forming \n\nradial clusters with several crystals, generally projected from the mica wall in to the quartz \ncore (Fig. 2.7). In thicker veins the small wolframite blades are highly corroded by quartz, \noccurring isolated in the inner vein sections. The wolframite vein content is directly related \nto the presence of thick mica selvages close to the wall. If associated with cassiterite, an \nintergrowth of the two minerals is a very common feature. With the exception of quartz and \nsiderite, wolframite is not easily replaced or corroded by other minerals. Wolframite is intensely \nfractured, never fi lled with arsenopyrite or pyrrhotite but often by siderite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, \nmarcasite and bismuthinite. Nevertheless, it does not present extensive replacement. The \nchemical analysis revealed 12.8\u201318.9% MnWO\n\n4\n, being considered has ferberite.\n\nThe most abundant mineral present in the vein system is Arsenopyrite (FeAsS; Fig. 2.8a), \noccurring in both fi ne grained masses and with euhedra crystals, commonly with several \ncentimeters long, and usually very fractured and fi lled with chalcopyrite, pyrite, marcasite, \nbismuth, bismuthinite, siderite and minor quartz. Arsenopyrite is earlier than the precipitation \n\n(a) (b)\n\n(a) (b)\n\n\n\n20 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\nof pyrrhotite and, despite his precipitation, is prior than the crystallization of wolframite. The \nmajor formation occurred after the deposition of that mineral. The bismuthinite, chalcopyrite \nand sphalerite strongly decompose the arsenopyrite, while wolframite, quartz and siderite just \nslightly destroy the crystals shapes. The native bismuth is contemporaneous with the later \nperiod of arsenopyrite deposition. Its composition is of 34.90\u201335.61% As, being richer in As \nthan ideal arsenopyrite. \n\nChalcopyrite (CuFeS\n2\n; Fig. 2.8b) is an abundant mineral with a long period of deposition, occurring \n\nas segregation of emulsion bodies in sphalerite or as massive grains contemporaneous \nwith sphalerite and fi lling interstices of earlier minerals. It also occurs in fi lling fractures of \narsenopyrite, wolframite, cassiterite, and sporadically replaces siderite. Chalcopyrite and \nsphalerite often replace and corrode arsenopyrite. Chalcopyrite also comprises corroded \nresiduals of pyrite-marcasite aggregates and replaces muscovite. Is common to fi nd large \nmasses of chalcopyrite, with exsolution bodies of pyrrhotite, stannite and sphalerite, fractured \nand fi lled with siderite and pyrite-marcasite. The chalcopyrite free of exsolution bodies \npenetrate the fractures of earlier minerals especially wolframite, arsenopyrite and sphalerite. \nIn the veins more distant from the greisen cupola the chalcopyrite grades to isotropic dark \nyellowish to brownish phase.\n\nSphalerite ((Zn,Fe)S; Fig. 2.9a) is \nnot a very important mineral in this \nparagenesis. Usually occurs fi lling the \nfractures of wolframite, arsenopyrite \nand earlier minerals in a smaller \nextent than later chalcopyrite and \nsiderite. Stannite (Cu\n\n2\nFeSnS\n\n4\n; Fig. 2.9b) \n\nis a common brownish anisotropic \nmineral under the microscope, \nalthough is a minor constituent of the \nore, occurring in exsolution bodies in \nchalcopyrite and sphalerite.\n\nStibnite (Sb\n2\nS\n\n3\n) occurs sporadically \n\nas blades or acicular crystals \ncreating covers in the veins, and not \nassociated with the late minerals \n\nFig. 2.9. (a) Sphalerite mineral (source: http://www.\nspanishminerals.com/, 2013); and (b) Stannite with \nchalcopyrite and arsenopyrite (source: http://www.\nfabreminerals.com/, 2013); both from the Panasqueira \nmine.\n\nstage of the veins (marcasite, pyrite, carbonates) but being part of the high temperature \nwolframite-cassiterite-quartz group. Small blebs and round grains of rutile (TiO\n\n2\n) intergrowth \n\nwith wolframite and cassiterite, being more common in veins far from the greisened cupola. A \nmineral that occurs through all the vein system is pyrrhotite (Fe\n\n1-xS\n). Due to instability under the \n\nnew conditions of acidity and temperature, the earlier abundant mineral naturally broke down \ninto the more stables pyrite, marcasite, magnetite and occasionally hematite.\n\nNative bismuth (Bi) and Bismuthinite (Bi\n2\nS\n\n3\n) are minor minerals closely associated and well \n\ndistributed over the Panasqueira deposit, forming isolated replacement patches in early \nwolframite and/or arsenopyrite. Bismuth is the fi rst to be formed, and is contemporaneous of \nthe later stages of the arsenopyrite deposition. When this sulfoarsenide is deposited starts \nthe bismuthinite precipitation, replacing the earlier bismuth. The precipitation of these two \nminerals was completed with the end of the sphalerite formation. Also silver (Ag) and gold (Au) \noccurs, being Ag more common.\n\n(a) (b)\n\n\n\n21Part I \u2013 Approach\n2. The study area\n\nGalena (PbS; Fig. 2.10a) is considered a minor mineral in the Barroca Grande section. This \nmineral replaces the chalcopyrite and especially sphalerite, being earlier than siderite. One \nof the most important gangue minerals and the most important carbonate, is siderite (FeCO\n\n3\n; \n\nFig. 2.10b) once it replaces and corrodes earlier minerals and its deposition followed an \nimportant period of ore fracturing. It\u2019s a common mineral fi lling the fractures of the wolframite, \narsenopyrite and sphalerite polish sections. Siderite corrodes arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, \nstannite, bismuth and bismuthinite, showing a selective preference for the replacement of \npyrrhotite. Acanthite (Ag\n\n2\nS) occurs as a primary solid inclusion in siderite, with depositional \n\ntemperatures of about 270 \u00baC.\n\nFig. 2.10. (a) Lenticular crystals of Siderite, very clear cream colored covering a matrix of quartz (source:\nhttp://www.fabreminerals.com/, 2013); and (b) Galena partly coated by prismatic hexagonal crystals of \nsiderite (source: http://www.edelweissminerals.com/, 2013); both from the Panasqueira mine.\n\nA large part of the Fe sulfi des occur as secondary pyrite (FeS\n2\n; Fig. 2.11a) and marcasite (FeS\n\n2\n; \n\nFig. 2.11b) associated with siderite. The majority of these Fe sulfi des occurs as large intergrowths \nresulting from the collapse of early pyrrhotite. Magnetite (Fe\n\n3\nO\n\n4\n) occurs as allotriomorphic \n\ngrains together with a few blades of hematite (Fe\n2\nO\n\n3\n) and clusters of goethite and intergrowth \n\na composite mass of pyrite and siderite with a few fragments of pyrrhotite. Goethite (FeO.OH) \noccurs in the veins as a result of hypogenic alteration of pyrrhotite associated with secondary \n\nFig. 2.11.

Scheelite (CaWO\n\n4\n) is considered the result of supergene alteration.\n\nApatite (Fig. 2.12) generally presents perfect crystals with variable colors occurring in \nthe mica halos and in vughs. This mineral corrodes and is corroded by muscovite, being \npene-contemporaneous with wolframite and cassiterite, but earlier than the later phase of \narsenopyrite. Calcite and minor ankerite (the late carbonates), along with minor pyrite, were \nthe last primary minerals to precipitate. Late calcite occur fi lling fractures in the later quartz or \ncoating all the other minerals, including siderite.\n\n2.5. Soils\n\nAccording to Cardoso et al. (1971) the Leptosols (eutric) are predominant in the study area, \ncoexisting with Cambisols (humic). Leptosols show little soil formation processes leading to \nvery shallow depth to the hard bedrock. For this reason, these soils are very susceptible of \nerosion, desiccation or waterlogging, especially in regions like Panasqueira with markedly \ntopography and severe climatic conditions. Cambisols are characterized by a defi cient layer \nof accumulated clay, humus, soluble salts, or Fe and Al oxides. These types of soils have at \nleast 8% clay and a minimum thickness of 15 cm.\n\nAccording to the Portuguese Soils Map (MAP, 1980a) and the Land Use Map (MAP, 1980b) the \nsoils occurring in the study area are mainly classifi ed as a mixture of lithosoils (shallow soils) \nof shale and graywacke along with Mediterranean brown soils from shales and graywackes. \nDue to the irregular topography, with steep slopes between 9 and >25% (some with ?40%) \nthe soils are narrow. The natural small thickness of soils and their very gravelly and clayey \ncharacteristics do not allow a normal agricultural development. On the bottom of the valleys \nthe soils are developed mostly on gravel beds of shales and graywackes.\n\nAlong the Z\u00eazere river, water streams and villages, the terrain is composed mainly by alluvial \nsoils with median texture, with slopes of 0 to 5%, allowing the development of agriculture \n(Corr\u00eaa de S\u00e1 et al., 1999). \n\nThe acidity of these soils is due to the characteristics of their original materials. Soils developed \nunder the infl uence of tailings or acidic waters, show decreasing pH. Their materials include, \namong others, sulfi des typical from the local tailings (e-Ecorisk, 2007).\n\n2.6. Hydrology\n\nThe municipality of Covilh\u00e3 is part of the Z\u00eazere river sub-basin, belonging of the Tejo river \nbasin. Z\u00eazere river is the most important water stream in this area. The river starts in Serra da \nEstrela and crosses the SW section of the mining concession (direction ENE\u2013WSW) with the \nRio tailing on his left bank (Figs. 2.1d and 2.13), fl owing for 200 km to the Tejo river. In Tomar \nmunicipality the Z\u00eazere river is intercepted by the Castelo de Bode dam, a very important \nwater reservoir once is the main supplier of water to the Lisbon metropolitan region, where \n1/3 of the Portuguese population lives.\n\nOn the Panasqueira mining concession is possible to identify six small water streams, dry \nduring hot periods, all converging to the Casinhas stream (formerly known as Bodelh\u00e3o \nstream), an affl uent of Z\u00eazere river (Corr\u00eaa de S\u00e1 et al., 1999). Casinhas stream bypasses \nthe south corner of Barroca Grande tailing and fl ow through a valley to the Z\u00eazere river\n(Fig. 2.1d). \n\n\n\n23Part I \u2013 Approach\n2. The study area\n\nFig. 2.13. The Rio tailing on the left bank of Z\u00eazere river, during dry season (source: Carla Candeias, 2013).\n\n2.7. Flora\n\nThe fl ora of the study area is composed mainly by Pinus pinaster, Eucalyptus globulus Lab., \nArbutus unedo, Castanea sativa and also by typical Mediterranean heather. The area is not \nfavorable for the growth of fl ora, once large areas are occupied by tailings and present hard \nslopes. According to Coelho (2009) the main plants existing in Rio and Barroca Grande \ntailings are: Anarrhinum bellidifolium (L) willd (Fig. 2.14a), Agrostis curtisii kergu\u00e9len (Fig. 2.14b), \nHalimium lasianthum subsp.alyssoides (Fig. 2.14c), Conyza sumatrensis sp (Fig. 2.14d), Rumex \ninduratus sp (Fig. 2.14e) and Erica australis L. (Fig. 2.14f).\n\nFig. 2.14. Typical fl ora from the Rio and Barroca Grande tailings: (a) Anarrhinum bellidifolium (L) willd; (b) Agrostis \ncurtisii kergu\u00e9len; (c) Halimium lasianthum subsp.alyssoides; (d) Conyza sumatrensis sp; (e) Rumex \ninduratus sp; and (f) Erica australis L.\n\n\n\n24 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\nThe former company concessionaire of the Panasqueira mine, the Beralt Tin &amp; Wolfram, made \nan agreement, in 1984, with Portucel Company (Portuguese paper manufacturer corporation) \nallowing the exploration of trees on 5.2 km2 of the superfi cial mining area. This agreement \nallowed the management, reforestation and maintenance of the local forested area and also \nthe paper production by the Portuguese company, with 1/3 of the profi ts returning to the \nmining corporation.\n\n2.8. History and mining activity\n\nThere are evidences that exploration in the Panasqueira area started with the Moors and \nprobably the Romans. In Vale da Ermida, Fontes Casinhas and Courelas sections of the mine, \nthere are long, ramifi ed and explored underground galleries believed to be ancient. Because \nsmall piles of rejected wolframite are common is this mines, investigators concluded that the \nexploration was essentially for Tin.\n\nPanasqueira mineralization became recognized with the discovery of a shining heavy black \nspecimen on the forested hills. This wolframite piece was sent to Eng. Silva Pinto \u2013 a Lisbon \nuniversity mineralogy teacher. By 25 November 1898 it was published the fi rst Portuguese \nPanasqueira mine exploitation permission for the society \u201cAlmeida, Silva Pinto &amp; Comandita\u201d. \nDuring this period the sections of Panasqueira and Rio (formerly known as Cabe\u00e7o do Pi\u00e3o) \nwere only superfi cial explored, having a manual mill plant (Leal, 1945).\n\nShortly after the beginning of the mining exploitation, in 1901, the concession was bought by \nthe Portuguese consortium \u201cHenry Burnay &amp; Companhia, Lda\u201d, who started the underground \nworks in Panasqueira and Rio sections. Additionally it was built a mechanical mill plant on \nthe Z\u00eazere river left bank (Rio section), once the river provided the water for the mechanical \nworks. In November 1909 forty one tones of wolfram were shipped to Lisbon (Leal, 1945).\n\nIn 1910 the British company \u201cWolfram Mining and Smelting Company Limited\u201d acquired \nthe Panasqueira mining district, defi ning the Panasqueira mining district with eleven mine \nconcessions and 21 km2 (e.g. Rio, Panasqueira, Barroca Grande, Vale da Ermida, and Vale \ndas Freiras sections). By 1928 the new company \u201cBeralt Tin Wolfram Limited\u201d enhanced the \nmachinery and the underground works. In 1912 it was produced 266.5 t in the Panasqueira \nsection and 13.5 t in the Rio sector, both with 65% WO\n\n3\n, leading to the Rio section closure \n\n(Leal, 1945). Between 1915 and 1917 the monthly production was ~30,000 t once the tungsten \nprices rose dramatically with World War I (WWI; 1914\u20131918). During WWI approximately 800 \nworkers were on underground works and 1,000 inhabitants from all surrounding parishes \nexplored the mountains for \u201cKilo\u201d \u2013 exploitation of superfi cial ore (Fig. 2.15). The end of WWI \n\nFig. 2.15. Women colleting wolframite in superfi cial \nworks \u2013 \u201cKilo\u201d works (source: Leal, 1945).\n\n\n\n25Part I \u2013 Approach\n2. The study area\n\nlead to the mine closure. For the following years mining works occurred in discontinuous \nperiods: (a) 1920 to 1923; and (b) 1924 to 1926 (Leal, 1945).\n\nThe exploitation in Barroca Grande, Vale das Freiras, Alvoroso and Corga Seca sections \nstarted in 1928. By this year in order to do the benefi ciation of all the ore a new equipped mill \nplant was built in Rio sector. An aerial tramway (5.1 km; Fig. 2.16a) was constructed to enable \nthe extracted rock transport from the exploration sites to Rio milling plant.\n\nFig. 2.16. (a) Extracted materials being transported by the rope tramway to the Rio benefi ciation plant, after the \nyear 1928 and (b) the Rio mill plant, around 1945 (source: Leal, 1945).\n\nWWII raises the tungsten price radically (1934), leading to the development of underground \nand milling works \u2013 Barroca Grande was connected to the Panasqueira section for enhanced \nproduction. The number of underground workers increased from 750 to 5,790, and others \n5,000 for \u201cKilo\u201d. The amount of ore shipped reached ~300 t/month, being 1943 the year with \ngreater production with a total of 2,520,871 t WO\n\n3\n (Bloot and De Wolf, 1953). During these \n\nyears ~1,000 t/day of rock was extracted from underground works, and the rejected materials \ndeposited in Rio tailing (Figs. 2.13 and 2.16b). The eminent end of WWII and the Portuguese \nalliance with England (1944) lead to the prohibition of exploitation and exportation of wolfram, \nresulting on the mine closure (Leal, 1945).\n\nAfter the end of WWII (1945) the mining exploitation restarted with improved techniques \nsince the tungsten price was decreasing. The mechanization of the exploitation and milling \nprocesses was enhanced allied with the growth of tungsten prices caused by the Korean War \n(1950). Between 1957 and 1965 it occurred a reducing of rates and production. The tin rich \nareas were also explored in an attempt to recover from the low WO\n\n3\n values. The company \n\nstarts storing the ore to be sold during a value growth (Corr\u00eaa de S\u00e1 et al., 1999; Louren\u00e7o, \n2002). The production from 1947 to 2004 was of 94,456 t WO\n\n3\n, 4901 t Sn and 28,924 t Cu, \n\nrecovered from more than 27,453,330 t of rock extracted (Cavey and Gunning, 2006). The \namount of rejected materials resulted, consequently, in huge tailings and mud dams (see \nsection 2.9).\n\nThe new company \u201cBeralt Tin &amp; Wolfram, Ltd\u201d was followed by \u201cBeralt Tin &amp; Wolfram Portugal, \nS.A\u201d (1973), being 20% Portuguese (Banco Nacional Ultramarino), and the mechanization of \nthe processes was enhanced, new underground extraction levels were opened and the actual \nmining method was implemented in veins over 20 cm in width \u2013 the room and pillar procedure \n(Bussink, 1984; Corr\u00eaa de S\u00e1 et al., 1999; Louren\u00e7o, 2002). This exploitation method is applied \nin rooms of 5 m in width by 2 m in high, and pillars with 11x11m initially and cut in three \nphases until a 3x3 m section (Fig. 2.17; Dinis da Gama et al., 2002). In each shearer operation a \nsingle vein is explored. Once only 20% of the extracted material have signifi cant ore materials \n\n\n\n26 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\nthe benefi ciation process is very important (Martins, 2009). The annual production in 1978 \nwas 1,450 t WO\n\n3\n (75.5% with very high quality), 62 t cassiterite concentrates (72% Sn), 1,101 \n\nt chalcopyrite concentrates (22% Cu) and variable amounts of silver (Kelly and Rey, 1979). \nThadeu (1971) reported that in 1970 around 868 g of Ag per ton of chalcopyrite concentrate \nwere produced. According to Bussink (1984) until 1984 four levels of extraction existed, \nnamely Level 0 (675 m), Level 1 (615 m), Level 2 (562 m) and Level 3 (530 m).\n\n\u201cMinorco SA\u201d mining company (1990) kept the mine closed until 1996. The Canadian company \n\u201cAvocet Ventures\u201d bought the mine and improved the milling processes. Rio facilities were \ntransferred to Barroca Grande, where all the exploitation took place and, since 1971, the \nHeavy Media Separation (HMS) operated (Reis, 1971). Rio mill plant was only performing \na simplifi ed separation on the thinner ore materials received by the aerial ropeway, already \nselected (Cavey and Gunning, 2006). The tramway had the transport capacity of 40 t h-1, using \n100 aluminum containers of 400 kg material loads each. Reis (1971) reported a recovery of \n94.1% WO\n\n3\n, 65% Sn and 85% Cu in Rio mill plant, from a total of 158,780 t of benefi ciated \n\nore, using 2.5 m3 water (Z\u00eazere river) for each ore ton. In 2005 the price of tungsten rose \ndramatically and subsequently the production rate on the mine was increased (Cavey and \nGunning, 2006). In October 2007, the mine owner changed once more to \u201cSojitz Beralt Tin &amp; \nWolfram (Portugal) SA\u201d and an offi cial video (http://www.portugalindustry.com/, 2013) reports \n355 workers, and over 3,000 km of open fl ow underground galleries.\n\nAccording to Cavey and Gunning (2006) the actual sampling method for estimating the ore \ndistribution is used for several decades and has proved reliable and accurate. The formula is \napplied to the measured area and mine grades are reported in terms of recoverable wolfram \nper horizontal square meter of vein and, subsequently, converted to recoverable wolfram per \nton of ore. The measuring consists on the portion of the wolframite crystals amount within \nthe vein, since the areas of the wolfram are accumulated for a specifi c length of exposed vein \nand recorded along with the length sampled and the average vein thickness (Mendes, 1958).\n\nThe actual method used in the mill plant is explained as follows: (a) initial crushing; (b) HMS; \n(c) main crushing; (d) sands cycle; (e) mud cycle; (f) fi nal concentration; and (g) copper cycle \n(Fig. 2.18; Martins, 2009).\n\nThrough the years, as stated before, the exploitation and benefi ciation methods had evolved \nleading to different grain sizes and mineralogical compositions through the horizontal and \nvertical axis of the tailing bodies. The different rejected materials are broadly classifi ed as: (a) \ncoarse steriles from the mine (<2.5 mm to 3.0 mm); (b) coarse tailings (steriles) from the HMS \n(c) sand (<3.0 mm to >0.5 mm); and (d) mud and slush (<0.5 mm of which 41%&lt;0.025 mm; \nGilchrist and Mahmoud, 1999; e-Ecorisk, 2004). The fi rst three types are disposed in tailings, \nwhile the (d) type is discharged in open air impoundments built specifi cally for that propose \n(e-Ecorisk, 2004).\n\n11 m 5 m\n\n11 m\n\n5 m\n\n5 m 3 m\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nFig. 2.17.

Environmental impact\n\nThe most notorious evidences of the exploitation for the last 110 years are the Panasqueira \nmine tailings: (a) Vale da Ermida \u2013 100,000 m3; Panasqueira \u2013 1,000,000 m3; (c) Rio \u2013 1,200,000 \nm3; and (d) Barroca Grande \u2013 7,000,000 m3 (e-Ecorisk, 2004). These last two tailings are \nlocated inside the study area of this research and disclose an environmental concern.\n\nThe Rio tailing (Figs. 2.13, 2.16, 2.19) is located above the left bank of the Z\u00eazere river. As \nstated before it was raised by various means over 9 decades and abandoned since 1996, \npresenting potential dangers. Until the early 60\u2019s the rejected dry fi ne fraction was deposited \nwith the coarse materials (Gilchrist and Mahmoud, 1999). This tailing is characterized by 32 \nto 36\u00ba slopes and shows an average 90 m altitude from bottom to top, although maximum \nvalues of 200 m are noticed on some tailing points, having an extension of 1,900 m along the \nZ\u00eazere river (Fig. 2.19c). The superfi cial layer (0\u201310 cm depth) is composed by oxidized coarse \n\n\n\n28 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\nand angular materials (2\u201312 mm \u00d8), bigger than Barroca Grande tailing debris, once it was \nsubject to less effective milling techniques. Under this depth the percentage of clay materials \nis more signifi cant, increasing the internal cohesion and the capability of retaining humidity \nand percolating waters. Time leads to consolidation and oxidation of the materials in depth \nwith consequent increase of resistance, enhanced by the discontinuity of material deposition \n(Gilchrist and Mahmoud, 1999; Crosby, 2001; e-Ecorisk, 2007).\n\nA seepage collection channel was installed on the bottom of Rio deposit. Even though the \nchannel system appears to work, materials have been creped down both by erosion and \naction of the Z\u00eazere river superfi cial waters (Fig. 2.20; Gilchrist and Mahmoud, 1999; e-Ecorisk, \n2007). According to Gilchrist and Mahmoud (1999) during rainfall periods the river is often at \nfl ood stage and much or all of the collection system is inundated by the river. The percentage \nof annual seepage volume collected by the channel system may be surprisingly small, \ngenerating AMD with pH ranging from 2.5 to 3.0. The same authors detected a potential risk \nfor failure, especially on is meridional section. In case of collapse large amounts of rejected \nmaterials will be released into the river basin, resulting in acid generation with very expensive \n\nFig. 2.19. Rio tailing views, with pictures taken on a path situated on is middle high: (a) the superior section with \nclear signs of sliding and (b) the bottom part of the tailing with the Z\u00eazere river (source: a and b Carla \nCandeias October 2010); and (c) Rio tailing and Z\u00eazere river (adapted from Google earth, 2013).\n\n\n\n29Part I \u2013 Approach\n2. The study area\n\nand exceedingly diffi cult recovery of the river bed (Gilchrist and Mahmoud, 1999; Crosby, \n2001). Also, Crosby (2001) considers the existence of a great environmental threat due to a \npotential Rio tailing failure, mostly during heavy rainfalls and possible seismic events.\n\nA study conducted by IST (2001b) in Rio tailing considered this location as the main \nenvironmental hazard of the Panasqueira surroundings. Topographic cuts of the deposit \ndetermined the tridimensional stability and quantifi ed ~3 Mm3 in volume and ~6 Mt of weight. \nSlopes were considered as stables; nevertheless some sliding might occur in fragile areas \nby infl uence of percolation waters. Drillings holes on the tailing showed materials highly \ncompacted with very fi ne particles \u2013 about 52%&lt;200 mm, producing internal cohesion and \nhumidity retention capability (e-Ecorisk, 2007).\n\nA geochemical and geophysical study of the Rio tailing internal structure and geochemical \ndistribution revealed high water content, migration of fi ne particles and low resistivity that \nmight be enforced by heavy rainfall and lead to possible sliding of the slopes (Grangeia et al., \n2011). According to Gon\u00e7alves (2010) exists high concern with the Rio abandoned structures, \nsliding on the slopes and corrosion. The author points clear signs of negative environmental \nimpacts on the area between Barroca Grande and Rio tailings.\n\nOn the top of the Rio tailing (very close to the slope edge) an arsenopyrite stockpile (~9,400 \nm3; Fig. 2.21) was deposited and remained exposed to the atmospheric conditions until 2006. \nBy this year agglomerated rejected material was capped with geotextile and clay layers, as \nproposed by IST (2001a). The stockpile content have concentrations of: (a) Ag = 124 mg kg-1; \n(b) As = 210,000 mg kg-1; (c) Cd = 3,057 mg kg-1; (d) Cu = 1,426 mg kg-1; (e) Fe = 19.8%; (f) \nMn = 410 mg kg-1; (g) Pb = 1,450 mg kg-1; (h) Sn = 433 mg kg-1; (i) W = 2,989 mg kg-1; and (j) \nZn = 460 mg kg-1 (e-Ecorisk, 2007). The seepage water collected near this arsenopyrite store \nshows high conductivity and also high concentrations in trace metals, revealing continuous \nleaching instigated from the sulfi des oxidation (e-Ecorisk, 2007). Fig. 2.21 (from June 2013) \nshows sliding slopes on the edge of this stockpile. If disruption occurs the stockpile could be \ntransported down the hills directly to the Z\u00eazere river (\u00c1vila, 2007a).\n\nAnother important deposit exists inside the study area of this research \u2013 Barroca Grande tailing \n(Fig. 2.22) considered as stable although is much bigger than Rio (Gilchrist and Mahmoud, \n1999). This pile is adjacent to a small but perennial fl owing stream that drains to the Z\u00eazere \nriver, the Casinhas stream, posing a low to moderate threat to the environment due to the short \ndistance of Z\u00eazere river and the typically coarse nature of the piles (Crosby, 2001). According \nto Gon\u00e7alves (2010) Barroca Grande tailing is the most worrying area since includes the \nentrance of the mine and the milling facilities. This deposit presents hard slopes with no \n\nFig. 2.20.

These slags are commonly \nused on the roads construction. The same author considered this use particularly danger \nonce the thinner particles present >25% As (Gon\u00e7alves, 2010). \n\nBetween 2002 and 2007 the Panasqueira mine was subject to an International study \u2013 \ne-Ecorisk project (Contract n.\u00ba EVG\u2013CT\u20132002\u201300068). The environmental geochemical \nstudies revealed the existence of water pollution on the Z\u00eazere river generated by Rio tailing. \nThe rainwater runoff at the surface and percolates inside the tailings leaching the materials, \nbeing the sulfi des (with As, Cu, Pb, Zn, Sb, Bi, ...) the most easily oxidized and producing \nAMD (Fig. 2.20). To prevent the entrance of AMD on the water courses two water treatment \nplants (WTP\u2019s) were constructed in Panasqueira: (a) Barroca Grande (Salgueira WTP) for the \nacid effl uents pumped from inside the mine and mill plant and also the infi ltration waters from \nthe bottom of the tailing; and (b) Rio WTP (old and obsolete) used for the tailing percolation \nwaters and waters collected on the seepage collection channel. The treatment processes \nstarts with the removal of solids (muds) from the acid effl uents being followed by addition of \ncalcium hydroxide Ca(OH)\n\n2 \npromoting pH increase (from ?3 to ~7) and metal precipitation and \n\nfl occulation, according to the \u201cD\u00e9gramont\u201d system based on the \u201cCiclator\u201d (Reis, 1971). After \nthis actions clean waters are conducted to the ore dressing plant or discharged directly in the \n(a) Casinhas stream or in the (b) Z\u00eazere river (e-Ecorisk, 2007). Dinis da Gama et al. (2002) \nreported a mean fl ow of 810.22 L s-1 water pumped from the inside of the mine to the Salgueira \nWTP in January 2002. The WTP average fl ow ranges from 1,000 m3 h-1 (winter) to 250/300 m3 \nh-1 (summer); since the maximum water capacity is of 300 m3 h-1, a signifi cant portion of acid \nwaters are conducted directly to the Casinhas stream without any pretreatment during the \nrainfall season (Gon\u00e7alves, 2010). Crespo (2006) proposed the construction of a new WTP, \nthree times bigger (900 to 1,000 m3 h-1). There were evidences that the Salgueira WTP was \nbeing renewed in June 2012.\n\n\n\n31Part I \u2013 Approach\n2. The study area\n\nThe muds rejected and deposited on the Salgueira WTP and also the muds excluded from the \nore mill plant are deposited in open air impoundments, to dry and percolate in depth. Once \nthe base of these dams is not completely waterproof the impoundments create a signifi cant \ncontamination threat to the underground and superfi cial waters and consequently to the \nsurrounding soils due to AMD generation (Gon\u00e7alves, 2010; \u00c1vila, 2008a). \n\nIn Barroca Grande and Rio tailings three dams exist: (a) one located at middle high of the Rio \ndeposit; (b) one deactivated in Barroca Grande pile; and (c) one active also on the Barroca \nGrande tailing. The Rio mud dam (~731,034 m3; e-Ecorisk, 2004) placed near the former \nmilling facilities (deactivated since 1996) on the SE area of the tailing, contains typically silt \nand fi ne sand grains with gray color (Fig. 2.23a). According to Crosby (2001) although the \nslimes appear to be loose to well cemented, there are evidences of muds dumped down the \nslope over the tailings.\n\nThe two mud dams located in Barroca Grande tailing have ~1,193,885 m3 (e-Ecorisk, 2004), \nbeing one older and deactivated, located on the left base of the tailing, considered has \ngeotectonically stable. The active dam is positioned above the slag materials and is feed with \n~100 t/day (Fig. 2.23b; e-Ecorisk, 2007). \n\nTable 2.6 shows the contents of samples collected in stream sediments, alluvium, dams and \nsoils of Panasqueira area (e-Ecorisk; 2007). \n\nFig. 2.22.

The study area\n\nin range from 0.76 to 265.3 for the soil samples, 31.9 to 2,251.1 for Rio mud dam and 30.4 \nto 1,783.9 for the Barroca Grande tailing. At this stage should be noted that EI above 1 is \nconsidered higher than the safe level. Fig. 2.24 identifi es very high EI values at S. Francisco de \nAssis village and also in other areas. The EI results from the alluvium samples range from 2.9 \nto 19.4, mainly due to the high concentrations of As, Pb and Cu. These high values might be \nexplained by the erosion of the tailing leading to mechanical dispersion. Results show that the \ntailings and mud dams are enriched in metals at levels considered toxic for the ecosystems \n(e-Ecorisk, 2007).\n\nFig. 2.24. Mapping of soils EI in S.Francisco de Assis area (adapted from e-Ecorisk, 2007).\n\nThe Rio and Barroca Grande open air impoundments present very high concentrations of As, \nCd, Cu and Zn, much above the ones established by the Portuguese legislation (Decree-Law \n306/2007 part II). The fact that the sulfi des (arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite) present \nin the dams materials are exposed to the atmospheric conditions leads to a continuous \noxidation and production of secondary minerals like scorodite (FeAsO\n\n4\n.2H\n\n2\nO) and natrojarosite \n\n(KFe3+3(SO\n4\n)\n2\n(OH)\n\n6\n) \u2013 X-ray analysis of&lt;63 ?m and&lt;2 ?m fraction. Mineral solubility is variable, \n\nmeaning that the release of the trace elements (Cu, Pb, As, among others) might not be \ncoincident with the amount of sulfi des generated (e-Ecorisk, 2007).\n\nTable 2.7 summarizes the results obtained in superfi cial waters on Casinhas stream and Z\u00eazere \nriver (e-Ecorisk, 2007). This water analysis revealed low Cl- concentrations and in some cases \nhigh SO\n\n4\n2- and metals. The seepage waters (samples 10, 11, 12) presented pH values ranging \n\n2.9 to 3.2, evidencing the regional hydrochemical facies Na+\u2013Cl- type change to a Ca2+\u2013SO\n4\n2- \n\nfacies nearby the mining infl uence. These results indicate that leaching occurs in an actual \nand dynamic way, once the Z\u00eazere river hydrochemistry downstream Rio tailing shows high \nconcentrations of Al, Zn, Mn and SO\n\n4\n2- (samples 5 and 6 after the mining infl uence) also \n\npresent high contents in some of the heavy metals (namely Cu, Zn and Cd). However, these \nsamples do not reveal high As concentrations, mainly due to the co-precipitation with Fe(III) \n\n\n\n34 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\noxyhydroxides in the tailing basement. Arsenic can also be removed from the solution and \nprecipitate as scorodite. This mineral is the most common iron arsenate associated to arsenic \ndeposits as a leaching product. Its presence controls the arsenate levels in waters draining \nAs-rich ores. Scorodite formation involves arsenopyrite oxidation at low pH and high iron and \narsenate activity, and it only dissolves with increasing pH, meaning As contents are kept low \nwhile solution\u2019s pH is still low (e-Ecorisk, 2007).\n\nThe sample collected in the arsenopyrite stockpile from Rio tailing site (As = 210,000\nmg kg-1; Cd = 3,057 mg kg-1; Cu = 1,426 mg kg-1; Fe = 19.8%; Mn = 410 mg kg-1; Pb = \n1,450 mg kg-1; and Zn = 460 mg kg-1) showed high concentrations of As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb \nand Zn. The seepage water (sample 12) collected near the arsenopyrite stockpile showed \nhigh conductivity and also high concentrations in trace metals, revealing that metals are \nsuffering continuous leaching originated from the sulfi des oxidation which is taking place in\nthose tailings.\n\nThe coating (iron precipitate) was collected in the main river nearby water samples 10 and 11. \nThe coatings formation were originated by the pH increase, verifi ed when seepage waters, \nwith high levels of dissolve iron, mix with the more oxygenated river water (Carpenter et al., \n1975; e-Ecorisk, 2007). Comparing the chemical results of the coating sample (As = 37,000\nmg kg-1; Cd = 423 mg kg-1; Cu = 1,626 mg kg-1; Fe = 25.1%; Mn = 712 mg kg-1; Pb = 139\nmg kg-1; and Zn = 1,288 mg kg-1) and water sample 6 (Table 2.7) collected nearby, it seems that \nthe decrease of heavy metal contents in the water, namely As, Cu and Cd, is associated to the \ncoprecipitation with Fe and Mn oxides infl uenced by pH increment (e-Ecorisk, 2007). The same \nauthors concluded that the ferruginous crust also reveals high contents of Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd and \nAs (As = 40,000 mg kg-1; Cd = 453 mg kg-1; Cu = 3,305 mg kg-1; Fe = 12%; Mn = 572 mg kg-1; \n\nTable 2.7. pH, conductivity (?S cm-1), major ions (mg L-1) and trace elements (?g L-1) in surface waters (e-Ecorisk, \n2007).\n\nvar\nsamples ID\n\n1 2 3 4 4A 5 6 10 11 12 13\n\npH 4.3 5.7 5.7 6.8 7.1 6.9 6.9 3.0 2.9 3.2 3.9\n\nEC 350 1,088 851 59 37 70 76 3,630 4,400 2,020 1,260\n\nCl- 5 7 6 5 4 5 7 5 7 4 5\n\nSO\n4\n2- 152 605 441 4 4 9 12 2,991 3,717 1,398 727\n\nNa+ 5 12 10 6 4 7 7 18 19 12 13\n\nCa2+ 22 120 87 3 1 3 4 287 401 175 107\n\nFe 100&lt;100 290 40&lt;30&lt;30 130 82,500 91,000 9,400 1,700\n\nAl 1,500 800 600 13 7 134 266 149,000 161,000 99,000 6,100\n\nMn 1,100 7,000 4,100 19 4 85 256 88,700 92,600 22,300 10,200\n\nCu 190 600 510 6 3 43 121 42,700 54,300 20,100 2,100\n\nZn 2,000 6,300 4,800 18 21 105 181 49,200 44,500 21,900 12,400\n\nAs 5 13 13 2 4 3 4 2,138 544 146 48\n\nCd 15 58 40 0.2 0.2 0.9 2 464 393 226 88\n\nPb&lt;22&lt;22&lt;22&lt;0.3&lt;0.3&lt;0.3&lt;0.3&lt;22&lt;22&lt;22&lt;22\n\nSamples 1, 2 and 3 were collected downstream Barroca Grande tailing and dams along Casinhas stream. The tailings \n\ndrain directly to the stream up to Z\u00eazere river passing through S. Francisco de Assis village. These samples show the \n\nleaching impressed in the stream hydrochemistry trough a Ca2+\u2013SO\n4\n2- facies and also trough high metals concentration.\n\n\n\n35Part I \u2013 Approach\n2. The study area\n\nPb = 319 mg kg-1; and Zn= 663 mg kg-1) and confi rms the transfer of these elements from the \ntailing and mud impoundment. During runoff events, rain water dissolves secondary minerals \nproducing strong acid waters. During dry seasons these acid waters evaporate progressively \nand originate effl orescent sulfate salt crusts (jarosite and melanterite (FeSO\n\n4\n.7H\n\n2\nO)) indicating \n\nthe presence of an extreme acidic environment. The presence of melanterite was observed \nin Rio tailing basement. According to Frau (2000), the precipitation and dissolution of such \nsecondary minerals are processes strongly infl uenced by seasonal wetting and drying cycles. \nThe melanterite salt crust easily dissolves during rainfall events (e-Ecorisk, 2007).\n\n\u00c1vila et al. (2007a; 2008b) also studied the Panasqueira mining activity infl uence on the \nsurrounding environment, and concluded that the stream sediments are good receptors of \nmost metals, while the waters are the main responsible for the metal lixiviation, what was \nconfi rmed by the high chemical concentrations on samples under the mine infl uence. The \nresults showed that the treatment water systems existing in Rio tailing are not effective, once \nthere are high concentrations of Cu, Zn, Mn and some Cd on the Z\u00eazere river.\n\n\u00c1vila et al. (2007b) studied the heavy metals distribution on the stream sediments and alluvium \non the surrounding of the Panasqueira mine, and concluded, according to Birke and Rauch \n(1993), that the stream sediments refl ect the mean geochemical environmental conditions, \nleading to the identifi cation of geochemical anomalies and the natural enrichments. The stream \nsediments and alluvium samples collected allowed to verify the higher concentrations on the \nsediments than the background levels, with focus to the enrichment of 117x of As, 23x of \nCd, 22x of Cu, 6x for Zn and 37.5x for W (elements from the tailings lixiviation). In conclusion, \nthe authors considered that the slag from the tailings and open air impoundments are the \nmain sources of contamination on the surrounding area of the Panasqueira mine, being the \nexploitation and benefi ciation processes the responsible factors for the high concentrations \nof As on the stream sediments.\n\nFerreira da Silva et al. (2013; see section 12.5) also studied this region, in particular the S. Francisco \nde Assis soils. This analysis allowed to identify a contaminant group of elements associated \nto the mining activities (As, Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Sn, Y, W and Zn) and the identifi cation of the \nlocations that require intervention or remediation. This study also classifi ed As and Zn as the \nvariables that present high to very high contamination factors on the S. Francisco de Assis \nsoils. A Master thesis by Coelho (2009) that studied the vegetation of the Rio and Barroca \nGrande tailings concluded that the existing plants presented high concentrations of As Cd, \nCu, Pb, Zn, Fe and Mn, refl ecting their substrate. \n\nThe subsidence of the Panasqueira mine was also studied by Dinis da Gama et al. (2002). \nThe authors concluded that is directly related with the presence of main faults and to the \nexistence of water. The rotational and translation movements of the blocks are conditioned \nby the number of faults surrounding the blocks, being the ones with over four faults the most \naffected. The abatement of the lower levels, caused by the large open spaces generated \nby the exploration has direct infl uence on the superior levels. The amount of water on the \nunderground works also affects positively the subsidence.\n\nSome villages might be directly affected by the present and past mining activities, such as \nS. Jorge da Beira, Barroca, S. Francisco de Assis and Dornelas do Z\u00eazere (section 12.2) were \nthe populations are dependent on the agriculture and cattle breeding activities. Coelho et \nal. (2011b) conducted a study with the inhabitants of the S. Francisco de Assis village and \nconcluded that the population is experiencing genotoxic and immunotoxic effects originated by \n\n\n\n36 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\nthe exposure to environmental contamination resulting from the mining activities, since almost \nall studied biomarkes were signifi cantly altered in exposed population when compared with \na control population living and working outside the mine. These genotoxic and immunotoxic \neffects may lead to several diseases including cancer. Coelho et al. (2013; in section 12.5) \nalso concluded that the populations working and living in the surroundings of Panasqueira \nmine are exposed to several metal(loid)s originated by the mining activities. In this work, it \nwas possible to verify that the most important exposure appeared to be to As, particularly in \nindividuals exposed through the environment. Exposure to other elements such as Cr, Mn, Ni, \nPb, Se, and Zn also occurs but not at the same extent (amount of element/time of exposure). \nThe results indicate that the environmentally exposed group is more affected, specifi cally \nfemales, once they presented signifi cantly higher values of the most toxic elements, i.e. As, \nCr, Mn, and Ni. \n\n\n\n3. Materials and methods\n\n3.1. Samples description and sampling\n\n3.1.1. Soils\n\nTrace elements concentration in soil samples is dependent on the parent rock, physical and \nchemical properties, and also anthropogenic activities. The soil study allows the delineation of \ncontaminated areas. According to Alloway (1995), one of the main anthropogenic soil pollution \nsources is the mining industry. Soil contamination has been identifi ed has a major threat to \nthe sustainability of the soil resources in Europe by the Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection \n(European Comission, 2002; Rodrigues et al., 2009). Thus when the pollution represents risks \nfor the environment and/or human health, soil remediation should be undertaken. \n\nIn this study, 122 samples from the upper soil horizon (identifi ed as Soil\n0 \n\u2013 topsoil samples) \n\nwere collected within a soil sample grid of 400 x 400 m (Fig. 2.1d) in order to characterize \nthe superfi cial contamination. To evaluate the extent of the contamination in depth, once \nprecipitation percolates through soils and may transport soluble HM with the soil solution \n(Brummer, 1986), and simultaneously to attempt the identifi cation of geogenic markers, 116 \nsoil samples were collected from a depth up to 15 cm (identifi ed as Soil\n\n15\n \u2013 subsurface soil \n\nsamples). The different number of samples between topsoil and the subsurface soil samples \nis due to the incipient and lithic soils derived from metasediments substrate, which turned \nimpossible to collect six of the 15 cm depth samples.\n\nTo establish the local geochemical background 47 soil samples (Bk) were also collected \noutside of the contaminated area (Casegas area; section 12.2). \n\nOn each sample location the superfi cial debris and vegetation were removed, after what \nthe samples were collected. Soil samples were preserved in labeled polyethylene bags and \ngeoreferenced in UTM coordinates with a GPS unit (Fig. 3.1).\n\nFig. 3.1. Soil sampling (source: Carla Candeias, 2010).\n\n\n\n38 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\n3.1.2. Rocks\n\nFor a better understanding of the entire set of samples under study also local representative \nrock samples were collected: (a) two argillaceous shales (Sch\n\n1\n and Sch\n\n2\n); (b) one spotted \n\nargillaceous shale (Sch\nsp\n\n); (c) one quartzite (Qz); and (d) one spotted quartzite (Qz\nsp\n\n).\n\n3.1.3. Superfi cial waters and stream sediments\n\nSuperfi cial waters and stream sediments are extremely important to study, associated with the \nenvironment surrounding characteristics, the enhanced description of a polluted area. These \ntypes of samples also show a good correlation with the parent rock allowing the streams \ncharacterization.\n\nSurface waters and stream sediments sampling sites were chosen in order to evaluate the \ninfl uence of the tailings and AMD on the nearest streams and to distinguish the contamination \ndiffusion in the Z\u00eazere river. The samples locations were: (a) Casinhas stream (CS1 to CS8 \nand CFB); (b) Barroco stream (B1 to B3); (c) AMD seepage waters from Rio tailing (SP1 to \nSP3) and one sample from the mine adit at Barroca Grande (BG); (d) one sample on Z\u00eazere \nriver collected from the Rio tailing (ZZ) and one sample after Casinhas stream confl uence with \nZ\u00eazere river (CFZ); and (e) two local background waters (Bk1 and Bk2) collected before the \nRio tailing (Fig. 3.2).\n\nTo evaluate the seasonal variation of the elements concentrations, both in stream sediments \nand in superfi cial waters, the collection occurred in three stages: (1) April 2006 \u2013 samples CS1 \nto CS3, SP1 to SP3, Bk1, Bk2, BG, ZZ and CFZ (e-Ecorisk, 2007; presented in section 4); (2) \nOctober 2010 \u2013 rainfall season, samples CS1 to CS8, CFB, B1 to B3, SP1, SP3, BG, ZZ and \nCFZ; and June 2012 \u2013 dry season, samples CS1, CS2, CS3, CS4, CS6, CS7, CS8, CFB, B1 \nto B3, ZZ and CFZ (last two presented in section 5).

The \nwater collection procedures were: (a) water sample collected and fi ltered in to 1 l acid-washed \npolyethylene bottle and stored at 4\u00baC until analysis; (b) each location was georeferenced \nusing a multiparametric probe HI9828 with GPS from HANNA Instruments; (c) pH, electric \nconductivity (EC), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), dissolved oxygen (DO), total dissolved \nsolids (TDS) and salinity (SAL) were also determined and registered in situ (Fig. 3.3a); (d) alkalinity \nwas determined in situ by titration with H\n\n2\nSO\n\n4\n 0.16 N (Fig 3.3b); and (e) superfi cial waters were \n\nfi ltered with 0.45 ?m Millipore membrane fi lters and preserved in 30 mL vials with 0.35 mL HCl \n(~1% of the sample), in order to perform As and Fe speciation.\n\nFig. 3.3.

Vegetables, rhizosphere soils, irrigation waters, street dusts and \nsurvey forms\n\nTo investigate the possible environmental contamination on agricultural and residential soils \nof the surrounding villages due to the mining activities, four sampling media were selected \n\u2013 vegetables, rhizosphere soils, irrigation waters and street dusts. At each house/farm an \nadditional questionnaire was fi lled, characterizing the family habits and agricultural customs. \nThese media constitute the most important means to assess the impact of the anthropogenic \nactivities on the different ecosystems, including the public health of the inhabitants. Vegetables \nand rhizosphere soil samples (Fig. 3.4a) will defi ne the extent of local soil contamination and \nthe metals transfer processes from soils to the different parts of the plants, once the root \n\nFig. 3.4.

Waters samples (Fig. 3.4b) \nwill defi ne the infl uence of soils and human activities in the quality of potable water, for human \nconsumption and for irrigation. Finally, the street dusts samples will allow the quantifi cation of \nthe wind transfer of the contaminants from tailings and its infl uence in local soil, vegetables \nand air quality.\n\nThe collection procedures adopted for these four media and questionnaire were: (a) plants \n(identifi ed by V; specimens Solanum Tubersum Sava commonly known as potato, Brassica \nOler\u00e1cea L. usually known as cabbage, Lactuca sativa generally known as lettuce and \nPhaseolus vulgaris ordinarily known as red beans) collected and stored in polyethylene bags \n\u2013 collection conditioned to the availability of each plantation; (b) rhizosphere soils (identifi ed \nby Soil\n\nR\n) collected on the vegetables locations and preserved as described in section 3.1.1; (c) \n\nirrigation waters, applying the same techniques formerly described for the superfi cial waters \n(see section 3.1.3) \u2013 public water supply network, wells, small water courses, Z\u00eazere river and \nspring water; (d) street dusts (identifi ed by Dust\n\nS\n) collected with small brooms and shovels \n\non the streets in front of the backyards/farms where soils, vegetables and waters were taken, \nand stored in polyethylene bags for further analyses; and (e) a survey form to understand \nthe families uses and also the agricultural practices (see section 12.4). Table 3.1 describes the \nsamples collected on each village \u2013 S. Francisco de Assis (Fig. 3.5) and Barroca (Fig. 3.6), both \nlocated inside the study area; and Casegas (Fig. 3.7) located NE from the study area and \nUnhais-o-Velho (Fig. 3.8) located W from the mine (see section 12.2). These last two villages, \nlocated outside the infl uence of the mine and the prevailing winds, were selected for results \ncomparison with the samples under the mine infl uence.\n\nTable 3.1.

Soils, stream sediments and street dusts\n\nOnce on the laboratory soil (topsoil, subsurface soil, rhizosphere soil and background soil), \nstream sediment (from dry and rainy seasons) and street dusts (from S. Francisco de Assis, \nBarroca, Casegas and Unhais-o-Velho villages) samples were dried in an oven at 40\u00baC, \nhomogenized, sieved (<2 mm) and pulverized to&lt;177 ?m in a mechanical agate mill (Fig. 3.9). \nAdditionally stream sediments were sieved&lt;63 ?m for X-ray analysis.\n\nInductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis (ICP-MS)\n\nSoil, stream sediments and street dusts samples were submitted to multi-elemental analysis \nin ACME Anal.

The accuracy and analytical precision were determined using analyses of reference \nmaterials (USGS standards) and duplicate samples in each analytical set. The results were \nwithin the 95% confi dence limits of the recommended values given for this certifi ed material. \nThe relative standard deviation (RSD) was between 5 and 10%.\n\nSelective chemical extraction (SCE) in soil samples\n\nChemical forms of heavy metals in soils directly infl uence their bioavailability and toxicity \n(Zhou and Sun, 2002; Ma and Rao, 1997; Tessier et al., 1979). Trace metals can be transported \nin the secondary geological environment by different chemical mechanisms (Gibbs, 1973): (a) \nin solution or adsorbed on solids, being readily available in these conditions; (b) in organic \ncompounds or metallic hydroxides, for which chemical changes are required before they are \nreleased; and (c) in the crystal structure of some minerals, where they are generally unavailable \nfor the ecosystems.\n\nMany schemes of sequential extraction to assess chemical speciation have been developed. \nIn these, samples were sequentially treated with different reagents in order that metals \nwith different affi nities for the mineral matrix could be liberated (G\u00f3mez-Ariza et al., \n2000; Quevauviller et al., 1994; Meguellati et al., 1983; Rapin and Forstner, 1983; Tessier\net al., 1979).\n\nTwo representative samples (A1, A2) characteristic from contaminated zones were used \nfor the sequential extraction. The soil samples used in the SCE experiments were air-dried, \ndisaggregated, homogenized and sieved. A static approach to the leaching was adopted in \nthis study. With the static approach, a sample will undergo sequentially a leaching process \nstarting with the weakest to the strongest leach with subsequent analysis of each of the \nleachates by ICP-MS.\n\nThe fi ne grained fraction of soil samples was submitted to sequential chemical extraction \nprocedure in Activation Laboratories Ltd (ACTLABS, see http://www.actlabs.com), accredited \nunder ISO 9001 and 9002. Reagents were applied sequentially to the solid phase of selected \nsamples, according to their chemical aggressively.

Materials and methods\n\nby extraction with different solutions: (a) Fraction 1 (F1) \u2013 sodium acetate (NaOAc, pH 5) for \nthe extraction of exchangeable cations adsorbed by clay and those soluble in water or in \nslightly acidic conditions and co-precipitated by carbonates (the most labile bonded and \ntherefore the most dangerous and bio-available for the environment); (b) Fraction 2 (F2) \u2013 cold \nhydroxylamine for extracting amorphous Fe oxides and crystalline Mn oxides (metals bound \nto Fe and Mn oxides that can be released if conditions change from oxic to anoxic state); (c) \nFraction 3 (F3) \u2013 hot hydroxylamine for the extraction of amorphous and crystalline Fe oxides \nand crystalline Mn oxides; (d) Fraction 4 (F4) \u2013 aqua regia, for leach sulfi de species (metals \nwhich may be released under oxidizing conditions) and clay minerals; (e) Fraction 5 (F5) \u2013 four \nacids digestion (or total attack) where metals strongly associated with crystalline structures \nof minerals (such as the remaining silicates) will be decomposed (they are therefore unlikely \nto be released).\n\nFor Ag, As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, W and Zn an internal check on the results was performed by \ncomparing the sum of the 5 fractions from the sequential extraction procedure with the total \namount obtained after hot mixed-acid attack of the same sample. These calculations can be \nused to validate the results and as inter-laboratory comparison. For all the extractions, the \ntotal of the trace elements in the different fractions did not exceed \u00b110% of the bulk sample \nwhich is accepted as satisfactory (Pickering, 1986; Tessier et al., 1979; Yan et al., 1999). The \nrelative extraction ratio was also calculated by dividing the element concentration extracted \nby the individual leaching procedure by the concentration extracted by total attack (TA) as \nsuggested by Son and Jung (2011).\n\nX-ray diffraction in soil and sediment samples\n\nA total of 28 topsoil samples (<2 mm fraction) and 10 stream sediments samples (<63 ?m \nfraction) with strategic locations were selected. To identify their mineralogical constituents \nthey were submitted to X-ray diffraction at National Laboratory of Energy and Geology (LNEG \u2013 \nS. Mamede Infesta). The mineralogical composition (including effl orescence) was determined \nusing a Philips X\u2019Pert MPD machine equipped with CuK? radiation, graphite monochromator, \nautomatic divergence slit and 0.5\u2013receiving slit. A step size of 0.05\u00ba 2?, a scan setting of \n2\u201370\u00ba 2? and a 10 s counting time were chosen. \n\nSoil pH\n\nNumerous studies have established that soil pH have a great effect on metal bioavailability \n(Turner, 1994; McBride et al., 1997; Radojevic and Bashkin, 2006). The pH gives an indication \nof the acidity and alkalinity of the soil. Many chemical reactions are pH dependent and \nknowledge of the pH can enable the prediction of the extent and speed of chemical reaction \n(Reeuwijk, 2002). The procedure adopted was modifi ed from the procedure ISO 10390:1994 \nSoil. A suspension of soil was made up in fi ve times its volume of a 0,01 mol/l solution of \ncalcium chloride (CaCl\n\n2\n) in water. The pH was measured using a calibrated pH\u2013meter.\n\nSoil organic matter (SOM)\n\nSOM plays an important role in determining the fate of inorganic as well as organic compounds \nin natural soils (Schnitzer and Khan, 1972; Stevenson, 1982; Yin et al., 1997; You et al.; 1999). \nSOM can be roughly determined by measuring weight loss after burning. Results are typically \naccurate to 1\u20132% for soils with over 10% organic matter (Reeuwijk, 2002). The procedure \n\n\n\n46 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\nadopted was modifi ed from Reeuwijk (2002). Approximately 5 g of each sieved sample \n(<2 mm) was placed in a crucible and dried at 105\u00b0C for 24 hours. After cooling in a glass \ndesiccator their weight was determined in a mass balance (resolution 0.001 g). The difference \nof the weights yields the water content of each soil sample. The crucibles were then placed \nin muffl e furnace at 430\u00b0C for 20 hours. After cooling in a glass desiccator the weight of the \nsamples was determined in the same mass balance. The difference from the dry state yields \nthe soil organic matter content (%).\n\n3.2.2. Rocks\n\nAbout 1 kg of each rock sample was crushed with a jaw crusher. The samples were reduced \nto 250 g by coning and quartering, followed by drying at 40\u00baC. After homogenization aliquots \nof 30\u201350 g of each dried sample were powdered in a mechanical agate mill (Fig. 3.10).\n\n250 g coning\nand quartering\n\nstorage (remaining portion)\n\nstorage\n(half&lt;2 mm sieved sample)\n\nsample\n(unprocessed)\n\n1 kg crushed\n\nstorage (remaining portion)\n\nwashed and sawed\n\nICP-MS analysis\n\nstorage\n(half&lt;2 mm sieved sample)\n\nmacroscopial analysis\n\nthin sections\n\noptical microscope\nmineralogical caracterization\n\nstorage\nremaining rock sample)\n\nFig. 3.10. Flowchart of the \npreparation of rock \nsamples.\n\nInductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)\n\nThe powdered rock samples were submitted for chemical analysis and multielement analysis \nto ACME (Anal. ISO 9002 Accredited Lab-Canada; http://acmelab.com/). For major and trace \nelements analysis a 0.25 g aliquot of each powdered sample was heated in HClO\n\n4\n\u2013HNO\n\n3\n\u2013\n\nHCl\u2013HF to fuming and taken to dryness. The residue was dissolved in HCl. The solution was \nanalyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The digestion is only \npartial for some S, Cr and Ba minerals and some oxides of Al and Mn. Volatilization during \nfuming may result in some loss of As, Sb and Au. The detection limits for trace elements were \nas follows: 0.1 mg kg-1 for Ag, Bi, Cd, Cu, La, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Th and W; 0.2 mg kg-1 for Co; \n0.5 mg kg-1 for Te and Tl; 1 mg kg-1 for As, Ba, Cr, Mn, Sc, Se, Sr and Zn; 4 mg kg-1 for V. The \ndetection limits for major elements were as follows: 0.001% for Na, P, and Ti; 0.01% for Al, Ca, \nFe, K, Mg; 0.1 mg kg-1 for S. The accuracy and analytical precision of the analytical method \nwere verifi ed against standard reference materials (OREAS 24P) and duplicate samples in \neach analytical set. The results were within the 95% confi dence limits of the recommended \nvalues for this certifi ed material. Overall analytical precision was \u00b13% for the major and trace \nelements analyzed.\n\n\n\n47Part I \u2013 Approach\n3. Materials and methods\n\nMineralogical characterization and petrographic study\n\nThe mineralogical identifi cation of the mineral constituents of the rocks is the fi rst step of \nthe rock analysis and classifi cation. These studies were carried out by National Laboratory \nof Energy and Geology (LNEG \u2013 S. Mamede Infesta). After the macroscopic analysis, thin \nsections of each collected rocks were produced, for observation under the optical microscope \n\u2013 Olympus BX51. With this procedure is possible to identify the optical properties of the \nminerals, as isotropy, anisotropy, refraction indices, among others.\n\nOn another phase of the study a petrographic investigation was carried out on the collected \nrocks, which identify the different mineralogical phases of each sample. For this procedure \nis used the same microscope referred before and the thin sections produced earlier, allowing \nthe observation of the mineralogical composition and texture, alteration occurred and fi nally \nthe interpretation and classifi cation of each rock.\n\nOnce the report presented by LNEG is in the Portuguese language an overview is summarized \nin section 12.3.\n\n3.2.3. Waters\n\nOn the laboratory the preserved 500 mL water samples were fi ltered with a 0.45 ?m Millipore \nmembrane fi lter, and 100 mL were acidifi ed with concentrated HNO\n\n3\n and bottled for analysis of \n\ndissolved trace elements. The acid will avoid the Fe hydroxide precipitation and the alteration \nof the samples due to the presence of biological organisms (Fig. 3.11).\n\n500 ml bottles\n\nfreezer storage\n(remaining sample)\n\n100 ml not acidified\n\nmajor cations\nmajor anions\n\nfiltered&lt;45 ?m100 ml acidified HCO3\n\nICP-MS analysis\n\nInductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)\n\nSurface water samples were analyzed without pre-concentration.

The concentrations \nof trace elements in acidifi ed waters were all determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma \nMass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Reagent blanks and duplicate samples were inserted into \neach batch for quality control (Ramsey et al., 1987). Depending on the concentration levels, \n\nFig. 3.11.

It was used a Dionex 2000 SPI chromatograph on the \nGeochemistry Laboratory of the Geosciences Department, in Aveiro University. \n\nWater samples speciation\n\nInorganic arsenic is a naturally occurring element present in both superfi cial and groundwaters \nas well as in many animals and plants. The presence of arsenic in natural waters is a matter \nof concern concidering the toxicity and possible carcinogenic activity. The environment \ninfl uences the oxidation state of the existing As in waters: (a) As(III) and (b) As(V), being the last \nthermodynamically favored. As(III) has higher toxicity to animals and plants than As(V), since \nhas the ability of forming complexes with certain co-enzymes. Consequently the importance \nof the speciation of As is high, in order to understand the biological and geochemical behavior \nof this element (Ferreira and Barros, 2002).\n\nThe As(III) and As\ntotal\n\n were determined by Cathodic Stripping Voltammetry (CSV) (Ferreira \nand Barros, 2002), using a hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE). The method requires \nhydrogen chloride (HCl) 1M as electrolyte support and the presence of Cu(II), as it involves \nthe preconcentration of a copper-arsenic intermetallic compound at the mercury electrode. \nThe determination of As\n\ntotal\n involves the reduction of As(V) with thiosulfate and the subsequent \n\ndetermination of As(III); As(V) is obtained by difference.\n\nIn waters infl uenced by mining activities is especially important the quantifi cation of Fe, as it is \npossibly the major constituent in such waters. Aqueous speciation is sensitive to the absolute \nconcentrations of Fe(II) and Fe(III) as well as the Fe(II)/Fe(III) ratio. Fe(III) precipitates readily, \nforming hydrous ferric oxide, which adsorbs trace metals. Therefore, the mobility and toxicity \nof metals is controlled by the Fe present in those waters (To et al., 1999).\n\nIn this study the Fe(III) concentration is obtained by the difference between the concentrations \nof Fe\n\ntotal\n and Fe(II), being Fe(II) determined by a colorimetric method and Fe\n\ntotal\n by another \n\nmethod such AEOS\u2013ICP or AAS after reduction of Fe(III). In this work, Fe(III), Fe(II) and Fe\ntotal \n\nwere determined by a colour spectrophotometric-Vis method using FerroZine Iron Reagent. \nThe method requires preservation of water samples by fi ltration through a 0.2 micron membrane \nand acidifi cation to pH 1 with HCl (0.4% HCl), and storage in the dark (To et al., 1999).\n\n3.2.4. Vegetables\n\nThe vegetables were well washed to remove the soil particles, separated by their constituent \norgans (roots, stem, leafs and fruits, if any), separately weighted, oven dried at 40\u00baC until a \nconstant weight was attained, weighted and milled &lt;177 ?m for chemical analysis (Fig. 3.12).\n\nInductively coupled plasma-emission spectrometry analysis (ICP-ES)\n\nThe fi ne grained fraction of each part of the vegetables was submitted to multi-elemental \nanalysis in ACME Anal.

The results were within \nthe 95% confi dence limits of the recommended values given for this certifi ed material. The \nrelative standard deviation was between 5 and 10%.\n\n3.2.5. Biological samples\n\nSample collection and the preparation for quantifi cation of total concentration in all fi ve \nmatrices were performed as described in Coelho et al. (2013a,b). All samples were coded and \nanalysed under blind conditions. This section content was performed by Coelho (2013) and \nCoelho et al. (2012, 2013a,b).\n\n3.2.5.1. Blood samples (B)\n\nSamples were collected by venipuncture in tubes containing ethylenediamine tetraacetic \nacid (EDTA). Samples were transported under refrigeration and kept at approximately 4\u00baC. \nBlood samples (1-2 g) were added to 2 mL of HNO\n\n3\n in Tefl on vials and digested for 24 h at\n\n100\u00baC. After cooling, the digested solutions were diluted with deionized water up to\n10 mL in polypropylene tubes for elemental analysis. For microwave digestion, an Anton Paar \nMultiwave 3000 oven, equipped with 16 vessels, was used.\n\n3.2.5.2. Urine samples (U)\n\nFirst morning urine samples (minimum volume 20 mL) were collected in polyethylene sterile \nbottles. Samples were transported under refrigeration (-20\u00baC) until analysis. Urine samples \nwere defrosted 24 h before the analysis, centrifuged for 3 min at 2500 rpm, and diluted up to \n25-fold with 1% v/v HNO3 for elemental analysis. For As speciation in samples preparation \n\nFig. 3.12.

(2011), with some \nalterations in the reagents and instrumentation described in the section \u201cSpeciation of As in\nurine samples\u201d.\n\n3.2.5.3. Nail samples\n\nFinger (FN) and toe (TN) nail samples were collected with stainless steel scissors and stored \nin polyethylene bags. Samples were transported under refrigeration (-20\u00baC) until analysis. \nFingernail and toenail samples were washed thoroughly following a slightly modifi ed version of \nthe protocol described by Slotnick et al. (2007). Visible exogenous material was fi rst removed \nusing plastic forceps. Samples were then placed in clean glass vials and sonicated for 5min \nusing acetone, rinsed with deionised water followed by acetone, sonicated for 10 min with \ndeionised water, then rinsed twice with deionised water, ensuring complete submersion of the \nsample during each step. All samples were oven dried at 60\u00baC overnight. Samples were acid \ndigested using closed vessel microwave assisted heating (Anton Paar Multiwave 3000 oven, \nequipped with 16 vessels). Into each vessel 2 mL of HNO\n\n3\n was added to accurately weighed \n\nsamples (200 mg when enough sample) and left to stand for 1 h before sealing the vessels. The \nmicrowave heating program was: 100% power (1,200 W), 15 min ramp to 170\u00baC, held for 10 \nmin, then held for 20 min at room temperature. The pressure in the system was approximately \n200 psi under these conditions. This method resulted in complete sample dissolution. \nThe solutions were transferred to plastic tubes and made up to 5 mL with ultrapure water\nfor analysis.\n\n3.2.5.4. Hair samples (H)\n\nHair samples were collected with stainless steel scissors and stored in polyethylene bags. \nSamples were transported under refrigeration (-20\u00baC) until analysis. Samples were washed \nfollowing a slightly modifi ed version of the protocol described by Schrauzer et al. (1992); this \ninvolved washing the samples four times with 1% Triton X-100, rinsing once with acetone, \nthree times with deionised water, and twice more with acetone. Each sample was washed \nfor approximately 30 min (total time) and subsequently all the samples were dried in an oven \nat 70 \u00b0C for 2 hours. Samples were acid digested using closed vessel microwave assisted \nheating (Anton Paar Multiwave 3000 oven, equipped with 16 vessels). Into each vessel 2 mL \nof HNO\n\n3\n was added to accurately weighed samples (200 mg when enough sample) and left \n\nto stand for 1h before sealing the vessels. The microwave heating program was: 100% power \n(1200 W), 15 min ramp to 170\u00baC, held for 10 min, then held for 20 min at room temperature. \nThe pressure in the system was approximately 200 psi under these conditions. This method \nresulted in complete sample dissolution. The solutions were transferred to plastic tubes and \nmade up to 5 mL with ultrapure water for analysis.\n\nMetal(loid)s in blood, urine, nail and hair samples\n\nThe inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) instruments used were a \nPerkinElmer Elan DRC II, and a Thermo Elemental X Series. A Perkin-Elmer Optima 5300 \nand a Thermo Scientifi c iCAP 6300 duo were used for inductively coupled plasma-optical \nemission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis. Before use and between each batch of samples, \nthe polyether ether ketone (PEEK) utensils were thoroughly washed with acid and then rinsed \nwith deionised water. For analysis of blood samples In and Sc were the chemical elements \nused as internal standards while Ge and Ir were used for urine, hair and nail samples analysis. \nAll reagents used were trace analysis grade or better quality. All aqueous solutions were \n\n\n\n51Part I \u2013 Approach\n3. Materials and methods\n\nprepared using ultra-pure water (>18 ? cm-1). It is important to highlight the fact that for some \nof the elements not all the matrices were analysed.\n\nDetermination of creatinine\n\nCreatinine adjustment is routinely used in urine analyses to reduce some factors that are not \nrelated to metal(loid) exposure, such as urine concentration and urine volume (Hinwood et \nal., 2002). Results of urine samples were adjusted and they are reported as ?g g-1 creatinine. \nCreatinine was measured photometrically using the Jaffe reaction (Roche Diagnostics).\n\nSpeciation of As in urine samples\n\nSpeciation of As in urine samples analyses were carried out with an inductively coupled plasma \nmass spectrometer (DRC-ICP-MS ELAN DRCII; PerkinElmer, SCIEX, Norwalk, CT, USA) \noperating with high-purity argon (99.999%; Praxaair, Brazil) in standard mode. The sample \nintroduction system was composed of a quartz cyclonic spray chamber and a Meinhard\u00ae \n\nnebuliser connected by Tygon\u00ae tubes to the ICP-MS\u2019s peristaltic pump (set at 20  rpm). The \nICP-MS was operated with a platinum sampler and skimmer cones, both purchased from \nPerkin Elmer. Other instrumental settings and operative conditions are reported in Batista \net al. 2011. A Perkin Elmer model L-200 LC pump, six-port injector (Rheodyne 9725) with \na PRP-X100 anion-exchange column (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) comprised the LC system. \nSamples were loaded with a syringe into a 100  ?l sample loop. All separations were performed \nat 25 \u00b0C, under isocratic conditions.\n\nThe mobile phase, prepared daily, was 10  mM/(98% v/v) + MeOH 2% (v/v), at pH 8.5. Analytical \ncalibration standards of As species were prepared daily over the range of 0.0\u2013100.0 ?g L-1 for \nthe LC-ICP-MS method by suitable serial dilutions of the stock solution in similar extractor \nmedium. The fl ow rate was 1.0  mL min-1. The effl uent from the LC column was directly \nconnected to the nebuliser with PEEK tubing (1.59  mm o.d.) and a low dead volume PEEK \nconnector. Data evaluation was performed using Chromera\u00ae software (version 2.1.0.1631) \nsupplied with the instrument, and quantifi cation was based on peak area by external \ncalibration. The detection limits were: As(III) = 0.1 ?g L-1, As(V) = 0.2 ?g L-1, MMA = 0.1 ?g L-1, \nDMA = 0.2 ?g L-1, AsB = 0.5 ?g L-1.\n\nDi-ammonium hydrogen phosphate ((NH\n4\n)\n2\nHPO\n\n4\n) and methanol (MeOH) were purchased \n\nfrom Sigma (Steinheim, Germany) and ammonium hydrogen phosphate (NH\n4\nH\n\n2\nPO\n\n4\n) and \n\nammonium hydroxide (NH\n4\nOH) were purchased from Fluka (St. Louis, MO, USA). Rhodium \n\n(10  mg  L-1) and multi-element (10  mg L-1) solution containing As were obtained from Perkin \nElmer (Shelton, CT, USA). Before use, plastic bottles, vessels, vials and conical tubes (Becton \nDickinson, New Jersey, USA) were cleaned by soaking in 15% (v/v) HNO\n\n3\n for 24 h, rinsed \n\nfi ve times with Milli-Q water and dried in a class 100 laminar fl ow hood. All operations were \nperformed in a class 1000 clean room and the solutions prepared in the laminar fl ow hood \n(class 100 capable). The high-purity de-ionised water (resistivity 8.2  M? cm) used throughout \nthe experiment was obtained using a Milli-Q water purifi cation system (Millipore RiOs-DITM, \nBedford, MA, USA). All reagents used were of analytical-reagent grade.\n\nStock solutions (100  mL at 100 mg L-1 as As) of the fi ve different As species were prepared and \nstored in amber fl asks at temperatures below 4\u00b0C. As(III) (As\n\n2\nO\n\n3\n; Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) \n\nwas prepared by dissolving salt in 50  mL NaOH 0.18  mol  L-1 and, after salt solubilisation, \nHCl 0.3  mol  L-1 was added, making the medium non-oxidant and preventing the conversion \nof As(III) to As(V).

(2013a,b).\n\nBlood analyses were validated using European Union, Institute for Reference Materials and \nMeasurements - Certifi ed Reference Materials (CRMs) BCR 634, BCR 635, and BCR 636. \nRecoveries varied between 81 and 83% and the precision of the method (for Cd and Pb) \nwas better than 10% coeffi cient of variation. Freeze-dried human urine CRM from National \nInstitute of Environmental Studies (NIES), Japan, was used in addition to validating the metal \nquantifi cation in urine samples, this material was also analysed during each analytical run \nas a quality control (QC) sample. Results from CRMs were within the reference range for As, \nPb and Se. As no nail CRMs were available, the methods for digestion and analysis of hair, \nfi ngernail and toenail samples were validated using a human hair CRM - NCS DC 73347a and \nNCS ZC 81002b human hair (NCS Beijing, China). The CRMs were also used as QC standard \nby digesting a portion with each batch of samples and determining the metal concentration \nalong with the other digests. Results from CRMs were within the reference range. Other QC \nmeasures used in the different matrices included the periodic analysis of suitable standards \nto check on instrument drift and short-term stability.\n\nFor As speciation analysis this was performed using a standard reference material from the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (SRM 2670a, Toxic Metals in Freeze-\nDried Urine, high level) were analyzed for total and As species. The obtained values were: \nAs(V) = 166.3\u00b13.2 ?g L-1, As(III) = 50\u00b12.5 ?g L-1, MMA = 1.7\u00b10.1 ?g L-1, DMA = 1.1\u00b10.1 ?g \nL-1, AsB = 0.7\u00b10.1 ?g L-1 (Sum of arsenic content = 219.8 ?g L-1 and Certifi ed Value for total\nAs = 220\u00b110 ?g L-1).\n\n3.3. Data analysis\n\nThe data obtained from the different medias samples, allied to the knowledge of the study \narea, were analyzed individually and combined, using internationally accepted methods in \norder to establish the associations between the contaminants and the probability of occurring \nhuman health problems on the studied populations. The results obtained will be compared \nwith international and national reference guide values to identify the contaminated sites and \nanomalous risk areas, both for environment and human health.\n\nThe obtained geological data and related interpretations will be confronted with biological \nfi gures (Fig. 3.13) allowing to identify human health risk areas and the anomalous standards \nfrom different sampled media.\n\nThe present thesis was developed in line with the doctorate study on Panasqueira surrounding \npopulations \u201cBiomonitoring of environmental contamination resulting from mining activities \non exposed populations\u201d, from Coelho (2013; UP/ICBAS/INSA). Coelho (2013) aimed to \nevaluate the impact of environmental metal(loid)s contamination in populations living nearby \nand working in Panasqueira mine, through a multistage approach that integrated information \n\n\n\n53Part I \u2013 Approach\n3.

A combination \nof both works will possibly allow establishing connections between some chronic diseases \nin the considered populations and the contamination resulting from the local mining industry.\n\n3.3.1. Descriptive analysis\n\nThe fi rst stage of a descriptive research is generally the univariate analysis. According to \nReimann et al. (2008), the environmental analysis should start with the application of appropriate \ngraphical tools. Histograms are important indicators of the data distribution, along with the \nuse of boxplots, showing the median, skewness and outliers. In addition is also important to \nestimate the mean, variance, and further statistical parameters in order to characterize the \nstudy data (Filzmoser et al., 2009). For these analysis it was used the Statistica Six Sigma \n7.0\u00a9 software.\n\nFig. 3.13. Risk analysis plan for the Panasqueira mining district and surrounding area.\n\ngeochemical\nmineralogical\n\n\n\n54 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\n3.3.2. Correlations analysis (r)\n\nThe Spearman and Pearson coeffi cients are the most common techniques used to evaluate \nthe correlation between two variables. The Spearman method is a non-parametric, while the \nPearson\u2019s is a parametric method that should only be used with a normal distribution. The \nappropriate statistical tools should be used in data analysis (e.g., robust methods if there \nare still outliers). In both correlation techniques the coeffi cients between variables may vary \nbetween [-1.00, +1.00], with -1.00 representing a perfect negative correlation, +1.00 a perfect \npositive correlation and 0.00 represents de absence of correlation (Davis, 1986).\n\nIn order to determine the extent of the relationship between the elements, pH and SOM a \nPearson\u2019s correlation was performed (Reeuwijk, 2002). For all the data was ascertain their \nnormal distribution by Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test (? = 0.05) and the Q\u2013Q Plots. The non-normal \ndata was subjected to a non-parametric test or converted logarithmically to ensure the \nquality of the results. The correlation coeffi cients were computed using IBM SPSS Statistics\n20\u00ae software.\n\n3.3.3. Principal component analysis (PCA)\n\nPCA is a method that aid in reducing the complexity of large-scale data sets and is currently \nbroadly used in environmental impact studies (Perona et al., 1999) by elucidate relations among \nvariables and identifying common underlying processes (Davis, 1973, 1986; Wackernagel, \n1998; Webster and Oliver, 1990). In the present study, factorial analysis, PCA, was performed \nallowing reducing the size of the space of the variables (Massart and Kaufman, 1983). The PCA \nmain goal is to provide a small number of independent factors (principal components) which \nsynthesize the associations between variables, being the referred factors (or PCs) orthogonal \nlinear combinations of the variables. The fi rst PC explains the major part of the total variance \nof the data set, and each successive PC explains a smaller part of the remaining variance. \nThe different PCs are then related with common processes that affect the variables through \nexpert knowledge of the problem in hand. The number of signifi cant principal components \nfor interpretation is selected on the basis of the Kaiser criterion with eigenvalue higher than 1 \n(Kaiser, 1960) and a total of explained variance equal or higher than 70%.\n\nThe PCA results will be discussed ahead (section 6, Paper III) however to explain some other \ndata analysis techniques it should be noted that the PCA revealed a strong correlated \nassociation between the Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, W, Zn elements. This group is controlled by the \ngeochemical signature of the Panasqueira sulfi de mineralization and was defi ned has the\nPTE group. The PCA analysis was performed using Statistica Six Sigma 7.0\u00ae software.\n\n3.3.4. Spatial estimation\n\nSpatial estimation variography provides a description of the spatial pattern of a continuous \nattribute Z (or an indicator variable I\n\nc\n), a pollutant concentration of a chemical element (Reis et \n\nal., 2005) or the anomalous concentration of a metal orebodie with economic interest (Patinha \net al., 2008; Reis et al., 2004). Given a data set for the variable Z at n locations x\n\ni\n, (Z(x\n\ni\n), i = 1, \n\n2,\u2026,n), the sample variogram ?\nZ\n*(h) (the symbol * in this text will indicate estimates) measures \n\nthe average dissimilarity between data separated by a vector h (Goovaerts, 1999,2008), \n\n??Z*(h) =  \n1\n\n2N(h) i=1\n[Z(xi) - Z(xi+h)]\n\n2\nN(h)\n\n  [1]\n\n\n\n55Part I \u2013 Approach\n3. Materials and methods\n\nwhere N(h) is the number of data pairs at a lag of h. For I\nc\n, the variogram is,\n\n??Ic*(h) =  \n1\n\n2N(h) j=1\n[Ic(xj) - Ic(xj+h)]\n\n2\nN(h)\n\n [2]\n\nThe variogram can be calculated for different directions of h, allowing knowing how the \nvariable Z(x), or I\n\nc\n(x), varies in several directions of the space.\n\n3.3.5. Ordinary kriging\n\nThe main application of geostatistics to soil science has been the estimation and mapping of \nsoil attributes in unsampled locations from nearby measured points in sampled areas. Kriging \nis a generic name for a family of spatial least-squares predictors. For the prediction of the \nvariable Z at a location x\n\n0\n, {Z(x\n\n0\n)}, the estimator Z*(x\n\n0\n) is defi ned as (Goovaerts ,1999,2008):\n\n?Z*(x0) =  i=1 ? Z(xi)\nn\n\n [3]\n\nwhere the ?\ni\n are weights found by solving the system of equations,\n\n?\n?\n\nj\n\nj\n\n?i ?(xi,xj) + ? = ?(xi,x),   i = 1, ..., n\n\n?i = 1\n\nn\n\nn{\n [4]\n\nwith ?(h) being the theoretical model for the variogram of the variable Z (fi tted to the sample \nvariograms) and ? being a Lagrange multiplier.\n\nThe software used to create variograms, to model variograms and perform spatial estimation \nbased on Ordinary Kriging (including map generation) was Surfer 11.0\u00ae.\n\n3.3.6. Estimation of the regional and local geochemical baselines\n\nEnvironmental geochemical baselines are needed in order to assess the present state of the \nsurface environment and provide guidelines and quality standards (Albanese et al., 2007; \nFrattini et al., 2006; Gal\u00e1n et al., 2008; Salminen and Gregorauskiene, 2000; Salminen and \nTarvainen, 1997). Tidball and Ebens (1976) used the term geochemical baseline in order to \ndescribe the natural background in areas of a heavy anthropogenic impact. Their defi nition \nwas that a baseline encompasses the central 95% of the observed concentrations. In this \nstudy the geochemical baseline was determined using the Tuckey (1977) paradigm. First it was \ndetermined the confi dence range, which exclude abnormal values \u2013 outliers. The geochemical \nbaseline is considered to be the median of the data within the confi dence range. The results \nwere positively compared with those obtained with the Tidball and Ebens (1976) method.\n\n3.3.7. Analysis of variance (ANOVA)\n\nIn order to gauge the relationship between the PTE\u2019s and the independent variables (depth, \npH and SOM), it was performed a two-way ANOVA test, specifi ed as\n\nZijk=? + ?i +?j + ?ij + ?ijk [5]\n\nwhere Z represents the kth observation of the PTE taken at jth depth (j = 1 or 2) and ith soil \nproperty (i = 1 or 2), ? represents the overall mean estimated, ? represents the depth effect, \n? represents the soil property (pH or SOM), ? represents the interaction between depth and \nthe soil property and ? represents the residual error (Zar, 1996; Johnson and Wichern, 1998; \n\n\n\n56 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\nCorwin et al., 2006). Log transformation was applied to the PTE\u2019s in order to obtain normal \ndistribution and homogeneous variances (Levene\u2019s test, ? = 0.05) of the data. For the two-way \nanalysis of variance samples were classifi ed according to pH values (very acid [3.0, 4.0[, acid \n[4.0, 6.0[ and neutral [6.0, 7.0]) and SOM ([3.6, 10.0[and [10.0, 39.0] in %). It should be noted \nthat the established SOM classes were only defi ned for statistical purposes. Once there were \nonly two samples with neutral pH the class was not considered in this analysis.\n\n3.3.8. Pollution load index (PLI)\n\nA quantitative approach of the multielement contamination was made based on the PLI \naccording the methodology proposed by Tomlinson et al. (1980), by deriving the nth root of \nthe n concentration factors (CF\n\n1\n\u00d7CF\n\n2\n\u00d7CF\n\n3\n\u00d7... CF\n\nn\n \u2013 where n is the number of metals). The \n\nconcentration factor (CF), defi ned as the ratio between each trace PTE in the soil sample \nand its background value (Gal\u00e1n et al. 2008). On account of the lognormal distribution of \nelements in geological materials (e.g. Reimann et al. 2005; Salminen and Tarvainen 1997), was \nassumed the median (value at the 50th percentile of the background data) as soil geochemical \nbaseline for each element, refl ecting natural processes unaffected or diffusely affected by \nhuman activities.\n\n3.3.9. Enrichment index (EI)\n\nOne common approach to estimate metal concentrations is to compute an index that \naverages the accumulation of each metal in each sample. To evaluate the degree of trace \nmetal contamination in soils the EI (\u00c1vila et al., 2008a; Ferreira da Silva et al., 2005; Kim et al., \n1998; Lee et al., 1998; Chon et al., 1995; Nishida et al., 1982) was calculated by averaging \nthe ratios of the elements concentrations (mg kg-1) to the permissible level (PL). In the study \nof the S. Francisco de Assis village EI on rhizosphere soils, eight elements (As, Cd, Cu, Mn, \nPb, V, W, Zn) were selected. The PL is the element concentration in the soil, from which crops \nproduced are considered as unsafe for human health (As = 20 mg kg-1; Cd = 3 mg kg-1; Cu = \n100 mg kg-1; Mn = 394 mg kg-1; Pb = 85 mg kg-1; V = 50 mg kg-1; W = 1 mg kg-1; Zn = 140 mg \nkg-1; Ferreira, 2004; Reimann and Caritat, 1998; Kloke, 1979). This index is useful to evaluate \nthe degree of multiple element contamination. An enrichment index over 1.0 indicates that, \non average, metal concentrations are above the permissible level, though element enrichment \nmay be from anthropogenic inputs or natural geological sources (Nimick and Moore, 1991).\n\n3.3.10. Contamination factor (CF) and modifi ed degree of \ncontamination (mC\n\nd\n)\n\nThis method was proposed by Hakanson (1980) and is based on the calculation, for each \npollutant, of a contamination factor (CFi). The CFi is the ratio obtained by dividing the mean \nconcentration of each metal in the soil (C\n\ni\n) by the baseline or background value of the specifi c \n\nmetal (C\nb\n; Ag = 0.05; As = 22.2; Bi = 0.3; Cd = 0.01; Cu = 28.4; W = 0.35; Zn = 58; Table 3.2; \n\nLiu et al. 2005):\n\nCFi = Ci / Cb  [6]\n\n\n\n57Part I \u2013 Approach\n3. Materials and methods\n\nAbrahim and Parker (2008) presented a modifi ed and generalized form of the Hakanson (1980) \nequation for the calculation of the overall degree of contamination (mC\n\nd\n) for each sample as \n\nbelow.\n\ni=1\n7mCd = (? CF\n\ni) / 7\n  [7]\n\nwhere CFi is the contamination factor computed for each of the seven pollutants (Ag, As, \nBi, Cd, Cu, W, Zn) considered in this study. Abrahim and Parker (2008) defi ned seven mC\n\nd\n \n\ndegrees as shown in Table 3.3.\n\nTable 3.3.

Potential ecological risk factor and risk index (PERI)\n\nThe potential ecological risk factor is defi ned as the sum of the risk factors (Ei\nf\n), which \n\nquantitatively defi nes the potential ecological risk of a contaminant in a sample i.e.:\n\n? ?\ni=1 i=1\n\nPERIi= EFi = CFi x TFi\n7 7\n\n [8]\n\nwhere: PERIi is the potential ecological risk index for each sample (i); EFi is the monomial \npotential ecological risk factor; CFi is the single contamination factor (eq. 6); and TFi is the \nheavy metal toxic-response factor for each selected element. Soils toxic-response factors \nwere computed for the seven selected elements according to the toxic factor requirements \nproposed by Hakanson (1980). For this estimation, they were used reference guide values of \nigneous rocks, soils, fresh water and land plants proposed by Reimann and Caritat (1998) and \nthe proposed land animal reference values by Bowen (1966). The TFi values obtained were: Zn \n= 1 &lt;Cu = 2 &lt;As = 5 &lt;W = 15 &lt;Bi = 20 &lt;Cd = 30 &lt;Ag = 35.

Human health risk assessment\n\nHuman health risk assessment calculations were based on the assumption that residents, \nboth children and adults, are directly exposed to soils (section 7, Paper IV), street dusts (section 8, \nPaper V; section 9, Paper VI) and waters (section 5, Paper II; section 8, Paper V; section 9, Paper VI) via three \nmain pathways (a) ingestion, (b) dermal absorption and (c) inhalation of particles present in \nthe air and/or by drinking water (USEPA, 1989, 1996; Linders, 1990; Berg, 1994). Ingestion (a) \noccurs by drinking/eating particles and/or licking contact surfaces (e.g. hands). It is assumed \nthat children present a higher particles ingestion rate, due to hand-to-mouth intake. Dermal \nabsorption occurs through exposed skin, while inhalation occurs both by mouth and nose \nduring breathing. Particles&lt;10 ?m (PM\n\n10\n) are the more relevant in this last process, although \n\nbigger fractions of inhaled particles are, probably, decomposed in the gastrointestinal track. \nThese assumptions lead to the conclusion that all contaminants are absorbed, both by \ngastrointestinal tract or the lung (Berg, 1994). Equations 9 to 11 were used to estimate the \nchronic daily intake of each route of exposure considered (USEPA, 1989, 1996, 2001; USDoE, \n2013), supplemented by specifi c quantitative information (Table 3.5).\n\nCDIing = Csoil x\nIngR x ExF x ED\n\nBW x AT\nx 10-6\n\n [9]\n\nCDIdrm = Csoil x\nSA x SAF x DA x ExF x ED\n\nBW x AT\nx 10-6\n\n [10]\n\nCDIinh = Csoil x\nInhR x ExF x ED\nPEF x BW x AT  [11]\n\nThe carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic side effects, for individual PTE\u2019s, were computed \nindividually, as toxicity calculation uses different methods (USEPA, 2007). For each element \nand pathway the non-cancer toxic risk was determined by computing the Hazard Quotient \n(HQ, also known as non-cancer risk; Eq. 12) for systemic toxicity (USEPA, 2001). If HQ \nexceeds one indicates that non-carcinogenic effects might occur. To estimate the overall \ndeveloping danger of non-carcinogenic effects it is assumed that toxic risks have additive \neffects. Therefore it is possible to determine the cumulative non-carcinogenic hazard index \n(HI), which corresponds to the sum of HQ for each pathway (Eq. 13; USEPA, 1989; Luo et al., \n2012a). The HI below one indicates that there is no signifi cant risk of non-carcinogenic effects. \nWith HI above one there is a probability of occurring non-carcinogenic effects, enhanced with \nthe increase of the HI (USEPA, 2001). The toxicity levels, for each element, were taken from \nthe risk assessment information system (RAIS; USDoE, 2013). The probability of an individual \ndeveloping any type of cancer over a lifetime, as a result to exposure to the carcinogenic \nhazards, was computed for each pathway as in Eq. 14 (Hu et al., 2011). The carcinogenic \nrisk was estimated by the sum of total cancer risk (Eq. 15).

Total metal in concentration vegetables\n\nThe total metal content for each vegetable (TP) was calculated using Eq. 16.\n\nTP = \n(Rdw x Rec) + (Sdw x Sec) + (Ldw x Lec) + (Tdw x Tec)\n\nRdw + Sdw + Ldw + Tdw   [16]\n\nwhere: Rdw \u2013 Root dry weight; Rec \u2013 Root element content; Sdw \u2013 Stem dry weight; Sec \n\u2013 Stem element content; Ldw \u2013 Leaves dry weight; Lec \u2013 Leaves element content; Tdw \u2013 \nTubercle dry weight; Tec \u2013 Tubercle element content.\n\n3.3.14. Estimated daily intake of heavy metals from vegetables\n\nThe estimated daily exposure to metals (EDEM) through vegetables is dependent on metal \ncontents in vegetables, daily vegetable consumption, as well as the body weight. The EDEM \nwas calculated according to Eq. 18, considering the average daily intake of metals (DIM) \npresent in 345 g of vegetables per day for adult residents (Luo et al., 2011a; JECFA,1993); the \nbody weight of an adult resident was set to 60 kg in this study.\n\nDIM = daily veg consumption x mean veg metal concentration [17]\n\nEDEM = daily intake of metals (DIM)\nbody weight    [18]\n\n3.3.15. Calculation of health risk associated with the consumption of \nvegetables\n\nIn the study of the inhabitants of the S. Francisco de Assis village, the health risk associated \nwith the consumption of vegetables was defi ned as the ratio of the estimated daily intake of \nmetals to the reference oral dose (R\n\nf\nD) for each metal (Luo et al., 2011a; JECFA, 1993), as in \n\nequation 19.\n\nRisk index = \nEDEM\n\nRfD  [19]\n\nwhere R\nf\nD represents safe levels of exposure by oral intake for a lifetime (JECFA,1993). If \n\nthe risk index is less than 1, no obvious risk is involved. If the risk index is equal to or higher \nthan 1, there is a potential health risk, and related interventions and protective measurements \nshould be taken. In the present study, metals/metalloids of concern were As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and \nZn, and only the chronic risk R\n\nf\nD was considered in the risk assessment (Luo et al., 2011a).\n\n3.3.16. Study population\n\nDescriptive statistics were calculated for variables describing the characteristics of the \ntwo study groups, namely, controls and environmentally exposed. Quantitative variables \nwere summarized by using n (group size), mean and standard deviation (\u00b1SD) of the mean. \nQualitative variables were expressed as percentage values. The departure from normality \nfor the analyzed continuous variables was evaluated with the graphical approach as well as \nwith the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Where the assumption of normality was not met, data \n\n\n\n61Part I \u2013 Approach\n3. Materials and methods\n\ntransformations were applied to normalize the distribution. The effect of exposure on the \nconcentration of metals was tested with the independent samples t-test of log-transformed \ndata. Associations between two variables were tested by Spearman correlation. The critical \nlimit for signifi cance was set at p &lt;0.05. The statistical software used for the analyses was \nIBM\u00a9 SPSS\u00ae Statistics for Windows v.20.\n\n3.3.16.1. Comparison with reference ranges\n\nData from this study were compared with some reference obtained from samples collected \nfrom Italian and Swedish healthy volunteers without a detailed description of the environmental \nor occupational exposure therefore are only indicative and may change signifi cantly from \npopulation to population. Numerous factors such as site of residence, gender, age, diet, \nlifestyle or geochemical environment need to be taken into account when establishing the \nreference ranges for a population (Rodushkin et al., 2000), and any comparison must be \ninterpreted carefully. Regarding the Portuguese population, there are few studies that report \nmetal(loid)s levels in exposed populations, and they show wide changes in levels within the \nsame population in different geographic areas (reviewed in Coelho et al., 2012). Therefore, \nin this study the element concentration obtained for the exposed populations is compared \nwith those of the controls, as they were matched for age, gender (only the environmentally \nexposed group), diet, lifestyle, geochemical environment and residence.\n\n3.3.17. Piper diagrams (PD)\n\nThe Piper diagram is widely used to study the similarities and differences in the composition \nof waters and to classify them into certain chemical types (Chadha, 1999). As described \nby Karanth (1987) the PD show the essential chemical character of different constituents in \npercentage reacting values, expressed in milligrams equivalent, for each water type. These \ndiagrams are computed based on the combination of the major cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+) \nand major anions (CO\n\n3\n-, Cl-, SO\n\n4\n2-) from two base triangular diagrams in to a central lozenge \n\n(Lucena et al., 2004). The diagram shows the relative proportion of the main ions, not their \nabsolute concentrations.\n\n3.3.18. Ficklin diagram\n\nIn order to interpret variations in drainage water chemistry Plumlee et al. (1992) developed \none diagram, based on pH and the sum of the base metals Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd, Co and Ni. These \nparameters were selected rather than more common metals such as Fe, Al and Mn because \nhave proven the most diagnostic in differentiating between different geologic controls (INAP, \n2009; Plumlee et al., 1999).\n\n3.3.19. PHREEQC code and WATEQ4F\n\nPHREEQC code and WATEQ4F are geochemical modeling software based on ion-association \naqueous model and are capable of describing chemical reactions and transport processes \nin waters, based on equilibrium chemistry of aqueous solutions with minerals, gases, solid \nsolutions, exchangers, and sorption surfaces. PHREEQC can be used, among others, as a \nspeciation program to calculate saturation indices (SI) and the distribution of aqueous species \n(Parkhurst and Appelo, 2013). Additionally it was applied the WATEQ4F as the thermodynamic \n\n\n\n62 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\ndatabase (Ball and Nordstrom, 1991), which contains the revised arsenic data proposed \nby Nordstrom and Archer (2002). It uses the temperature, pH, Eh, dissolved oxygen and \nalkalinity water parameters, and also the chemical analysis computing the distribution of \naqueous species, ion activities, and mineral saturation indices that specify the propensity \nof a water to dissolve or precipitate a set of minerals (Drever, 1988; Nordstrom and Munoz, \n1986). The WATEQ4F results are used primarily to examine the tendency of water to reach \nmineral solubility equilibrium as a constraint on interpreting the chemistry of waters. These \nresults are a helpful implement used for reaction modeling with the PHREEQC software (Ball \nand Nordstrom, 1991). The saturation index (SI) indicates if a solution is in equilibrium with a \nsolid phase or if it is undersaturated or supersaturated in relation to a solid phase. Equilibrium \nis assumed related to 0. If SI is below 0 the solution is undersaturated in relation to the \ncorresponding mineral and waters still have the capacity to dissolve that mineral phase. In \ncase of SI exceeds 0, then the solution is oversaturated in respect to the mineral and have the \ntendency to precipitate that mineral phase.\n\n\n\nresults and discussionpart II\n\n4. paper I\n5. paper II\n6. paper III\n7. paper IV\n8. paper V\n9. paper VI\n\n4. paper I\n5. paper II\n6. paper III\n7. paper IV\n8. paper V\n9. paper VI\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Paper I\n\nAcid mine drainage from the Panasqueira mine and its infl uence on \nZ\u00eazere river (Central Portugal)\n\nAbstract\n\nThe main evidences of the mining exploitation and ore treatment operations in Panasqueira are testifi ed \n\nwith the huge tailings, mainly, in Rio and Barroca Grande areas. Mining and benefi ciation processes \n\nproduce metal rich mine wastes. Oxidation of sulfi des from the tailings and fl ow from open air \n\nimpoundments are responsible for the mobilization and migration of metals from the mine wastes into \n\nthe environment. AMD discharged from Rio tailing has a pH around 3 and high metal concentrations. \n\nIn Z\u00eazere river, Fe and As are the most rapidly depleted downstream from AMD once As adsorbs, \n\ncoprecipitate and form compounds with iron oxyhydroxides. The Z\u00eazere river waters are oversaturated \n\nwith kaolinite and goethite, and ferrihydrite can precipitate on stream with a near-neutral pH. At sites \n\nhaving low pH the dissolved Fe species in the water, mainly, occur as sulfate complexes due to a high \n\nSO\n4\n\n2- concentration. Melanterite (Fe2+(SO\n4\n).7(H\n\n2\nO)) and minor amounts of rozenite (Fe2+(SO\n\n4\n).4(H\n\n2\nO)) \n\nand szomolnokite (Fe2+(SO\n4\n).(H\n\n2\nO)) were observed on Rio tailing basement.\n\nThis research was developed under the scope of the e-Ecorisk (2007) project and it was performed as \n\na preliminary study to evaluate the environmental conditions of the Panasqueira mining area.\n\nReference\n\nCarla Candeias, Paula Freire \u00c1vila, Eduardo Ferreira da Silva, Adelaide Ferreira, Ana Rita Salgueiro, \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Teixeira.

The trace metal \nconcentrations in the seepage water and water collected in the Casinhas stream are higher \nthan the concentrations in the Z\u00eazere river water. Sulfate concentrations cover a range from 4 \nto 3,717 mg L-1 and the highest concentrations are associated with waste piles and correlated \nwith low pH values (r = -0.98, p &lt;0.05). The TDS values of the seepage waters ranged from \n819 to 2,860 mg L-1. The Casinhas stream waters showed higher values of TDS from 227.5 to \n707.2 mg L-1 than those of the Z\u00earere river which ranged from 24.1 to 49.4 mg L-1.\n\nCorrelation coeffi cients of data (signifi cance level p &lt;0.05) indicate a strong association \nbetween SO\n\n4\n2-/Ca2+ (0.98); SO\n\n4\n2-/Mg2+ (0.99); SO\n\n4\n2-/Na+ (0.93); SO\n\n4\n2-/Al (0.96); SO\n\n4\n2-/Mn (0.98); \n\nSO\n4\n2-/Fe (0.96); SO\n\n4\n2-/As (0.72); SO\n\n4\n2-/Cd (0.97); SO\n\n4\n2-/Cu (0.98) and SO\n\n4\n2-/Zn (0.98). The high \n\npositive correlation with Ca, possibly, refl ects the infl uence of gypsum and calcite dissolution \nplus sulfi de oxidation. Table 4.1 shows that major ions contents tend to increase with the \ndecrease of pH, whereas HCO\n\n3\n- and Cl- showed positive correlation with pH, indicating \n\nthe dissolution of minerals related to the host rock composition. Based on these observed \nhydrogeochemical characteristics, along with the major mineral constituents in the rock and \nores, it is suggested that the seepage waters are related to sulfi de weathering and dissolution \nof secondary minerals whereas the Z\u00eazere river chemical characteristics of the waters are \nmainly controlled by dissolution of carbonate and silicate minerals.\n\nHydrochemical compositions of the water samples were plotted in Piper trilinear diagram (Fig. \n4.1). Generally, the seepage and Casinhas stream waters are classifi ed as Mg+/Ca2+\u2013SO\n\n4\n2- \n\ntype waters.

Paper I\n\nThe drainage discharges from Rio tailing are typical mine waters and belong to the\nCa2+/Mg2+\u2013SO\n\n4\n2- type. The results show that these three groups of waters have different \n\ngeochemical evolutionary paths during their circulation. The decreasing order of the \nabundance of major ions in seepage and Casinhas stream waters is SO\n\n4\n2- > Ca2+ > Mg2+ \n\n> SiO\n2\n > Na+ > Cl- > K+. The Z\u00eazere river waters have different pattern from the previous \n\nones and amongst themselves, upstream the tailings the waters reveal the following order: \nHCO\n\n3\n- > SiO\n\n2\n > Na+ > Cl- > SO\n\n4\n2- > NO\n\n3\n- > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ while downstream the effects of \n\nmining contamination is notorious once the decreasing order of the abundance of major ions \nis HCO\n\n3\n- > SO\n\n4\n2- > SiO\n\n2\n> Na+ > Cl- > NO\n\n3\n- > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+. The oxidation of sulfi de minerals \n\nin mine-waste rock piles and tailings impoundments generates acidic waters containing high \nconcentrations of SO\n\n4\n2-, Fe(II), and other metals. According to Blowes et al. (2003) a sequence \n\nof geochemical reactions occurring in the mine wastes and in underlying aquifers results in \nprofound changes in the concentrations of the dissolved constituents and in the mineralogy \nand physical properties of the mine waste and aquifer materials. The Casinhas stream and \nseepage waters show low pH and are enriched in sulfate ions but also in some of the major \nand trace elements.\n\nLow-pH conditions promote the dissolution of many metal-bearing solids and the metals \ndesorption from solid surfaces.

According to Plumlee et al. (1999) the group classifi ed as high acid and extreme metal \nrich are typical of drainage water derived from polymetallic deposits characterized by low \nbuffering potential. The most polluted waters are in or close to the mine tailing, where the \nmetal dispersion and acidity generation is clearer. Two of the Casinhas stream samples also \nshow a high metal content but with a pH value near neutral. On the other hand the waters \ncollected in Z\u00eazere river present a near neutral pH and low contents of metals, more evident \non the upstream samples. The high metal contents and low pH refl ect the infl uence of the \nacidic waters from the tailings and mud impoundments, while the low concentration values \nand neutral pH refl ects the dilution phenomena and the geochemical baselines values of local \nsurface waters. The plots of SO\n\n4\n2-, As, Al, Fe and Mn concentrations versus pH values (Fig. 4.2b \n\nto 4.2f) show the same trend of increasing metal content with decreasing pH and refl ects the \ngreater amounts of sulfi de minerals and a smaller content of carbonates and other minerals \nthat consume acid according to Plumlee et al. (1999).\n\n4.1.2. Water rock interaction\n\nChemical elements speciation was performed using the PHREEQC code in conjunction with \nthe WATEQ4F data base. Figure 4.3 shows the SI of the waters with concern to various specifi ed \nminerals.\n\nThe SI calculation of the representative minerals in waters show that seepage waters \nwith concern to the silicate minerals (Fig. 4.3a) present a negative saturation index being \nundersaturated in albite, chlorite, halloysite and K mica, presenting a positive saturation \nindex and are oversaturated in chalcedony and quartz. The clay minerals (Fig. 4.3b), kaolinite \nand montmorillonite, are undersaturated and most of the sulfates (Fig. 4.3c), alunite, anhydrite \nand gypsum, are nearly in equilibrium state in these waters. Regarding Z\u00eazere river waters, \naccording to the calculated SI, they are oversaturated in some of the silicate minerals and clay \nminerals and undersaturated in sulfates.\n\nThe seepage waters (SP1, SP2, SP3 and BG) are mainly saturated or near equilibrium \nwith respect to alunite KAl\n\n3\n(SO\n\n4\n)\n2\n(OH)\n\n6\n while the majority of the Casinhas stream and the \n\nZ\u00eazere river samples are oversaturated in gibbsite Al(OH)\n3\n. It is thought that an increase in \n\nsulfate activity may promote the formation of sulfate minerals (e.g. gypsum, anhydrite and \nalunite) when the aqueous solution is rich in cations such as Ca, Al and K. The association of \nalteration minerals alunite+quartz is formed at pH lower than 3.5, while the kaolinite+alunite \nassemblage develops at pH 4.9 (Perry et al., 1980; Wirsching et al., 1990). The relationships \nbetween alunite and kaolinite were determined by Wirsching et al.

According to Inoue \n(1995), the very low pH values observed in \nseepage waters, are related to the sulfi des \noxidation.\n\nThe mineralogical composition of the \nsamples collected in Rio site (in the dam \nand in the tailing), reveals the presence \nof arsenopyrite, scorodite, marcasite, \npyrite, mica, quartz, illite, vermiculite, \nnatrojarosite, kaolinite, chlorite, illite, \nmontmorillonite and montmorillonite\u2013\nvermiculite. The mineralogical composition \nof Z\u00eazere river stream sediments revealed \nthe presence of mica, quartz, chlorite, \nkaolinite, feldspar and hematite (XRD \nidentifi cation). At the base of the Rio tailing \ndam, scorodite (FeAsO\n\n4\n.2H\n\n2\nO), melanterite\n\n(Fe2+(SO\n4\n).7(H\n\n2\nO)) and minor amounts of \n\nrozenite (Fe2+(SO\n4\n).4(H\n\n2\nO)) and szomolnokite \n\n(Fe2+(SO\n4\n).(H\n\n2\nO)) were observed and \n\nidentifi ed by XRD. Acid mine drainage \ndischarged from the Rio tailing (SP1) has a \npH of 3.0 and high concentrations of trace \nmetals (Table 4.1). Also, As concentrations in \nthis sample are high (2,140 ?g L-1 As). Iron \nconcentration in stream waters decreases \nrapidly downstream with pH rising. Arsenic \nconcentration decreases downstream with \nthe same pattern of Fe (see sample ZZ \u2013 \nFe = 0.13 mg L-1 and As = 4 ?g L-1). These \nresults show that Fe and As are the most \nrapidly depleted elements from AMD and \nindicates that concentrations of Fe and \nAs decreases by dilution as well as by the \nformation of precipitate. It is well known \nthat As adsorbs and/or coprecipitates and \nforms compounds with ferric oxyhydroxide \n(Dove and Rimstidt, 1985).\n\nFig. 4.3.

Paper II\n\nWater rock interaction and geochemical processes in superfi cial waters \nand sediments due to tailings impoundments from the Panasqueira \nmine (central Portugal)\n\nAbstract\n\nSeasonal water samples and stream sediments were collected during two different periods (rainy and \n\ndry seasons) and analyzed for a wide range of major and trace elements, in order to defi ne the present \n\nhydrochemical situation. Rain waters interacting with the altered sulfi des stored in the tailings generates \n\nrunoff waters with high metal concentrations. The waste material derived from the exploitation enhanced \n\nacidifi cation and metal-releasing processes, due to the increase in the specifi c surface, which favors the \n\noxidation of sulfi de minerals. Acid drainage and high concentrations of metals (Cd, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, As) in \n\nsolution were observed in waters leaching the Panasqueira tailing deposits. In dry seasons, generally the \n\nacidic waters, enriched in metals, evaporate progressively depositing sulfate effl orescences characteristic \n\nof acidic environments. The dry period samples have pH slightly higher comparing with the rainy period \n\npH, while SO\n4\n\n2- and metals concentration are lower. Despite the expected dilution effect that should be \n\nmarked in the wet period samples, that dilution did not occur (at the time of the rainy period sampling) \n\ndue to the easily soluble sulfate minerals dissolution once samples were collected immediately after a \n\nrainstorm and the leachates had just drained to the river when the sampling occurred.\n\nThe distribution of the elements in precipitated mineral helps in the interpretation of aqueous geochemical \n\ndata. Seepage waters have high Al, As, and Si aqueous concentrations in the oxidation zone and the \n\nprecipitation of goethite and gibbsite (SI > 0) in this zone provides a sink for these elements. Aqueous \n\nconcentrations of other minor elements, such as Cu, Zn and Mn may also be attenuated by goethite, \n\ngibbsite and/or ferrihydrite precipitation in the oxidation zone through adsorption processes. Arsenic \n\nspeciation revealed that As(V) dominate arsenic species in these waters. The divalent ions Cd2+ \n\nand Mn2+ are the dominant species together with the sulfate species of Cd and Mn (CdSO\n4\n\n0 and \n\nMnSO\n4\n\n0) presented in the waters. The use of these waters for human consumption and for agriculture \n\nirrigation represents a risk to humans once they have a potential carcinogenic risk especially due to the\n\nAs concentrations. The acid water precipitation is present on the stream sediments, with concentrations \n\nexceeding the toxicity limits.\n\nReference\n\nCarla Candeias, Paula Freire \u00c1vila, Eduardo Ferreira da Silva, Nuno Dur\u00e3es, Adelaide Ferreira, Ana R. \n\nSalgueiro, Jo\u00e3o Paulo Teixeira. 2013.

The positive correlation with Ca (r = 0.68, p &lt;0.01) possibly, refl ects the \ninfl uence of gypsum and calcite dissolution plus sulfi de oxidation. It must be pointed out that \nthe two samples collected in Z\u00eazere river, suffer different infl uences from the tailings, once \nCZF sample records only Barroca Grande infl uence at a distance of 4 km and ZZ sample \nrecords the direct discharge from Rio tailing (Fig. 2.20a).\n\nTable 5.2 shows the analytical results of water samples from the dry season. In the dry season \nthe pH is slightly higher, while SO\n\n4\n2- and metals concentration are lower. These results are \n\ndue to the fact that in rainy season samples were collected immediately after a rainstorm \nand consequently occur the dissolution of the easily soluble sulfate minerals. During the \ndry season, the acidic waters enriched in metals evaporate progressively, depositing sulfate \neffl orescences characteristic of this acidic environment. These effl orescences are rarely found \nas mono-mineral phases and most of them are complex mixtures of Fe\u2013Al hydrated sulfates \nsuch as melanterite and minor amounts of rozenite and szomolnokite.

Paper II\n\nwere observed at the base of the Rio tailings where the more acidic Fe(II)-rich waters are \nfound (\u00c1vila et al., 2008a). According to \u00c1vila et al. (2008a), the mineralogical composition \nof the Rio tailing and open air impoundment materials, reveals the presence of arsenopyrite, \nscorodite, marcasite, pyrite, mica, quartz, illite, vermiculite, natrojarosite, kaolinite, chlorite \nand montmorillonite (XRD identifi cation) and at the base of the Rio tailings dam, scorodite \n[FeAsO\n\n4\n.2H\n\n2\nO], melanterite [Fe(SO\n\n4\n).7(H\n\n2\nO)] and minor amounts of rozenite [Fe(SO\n\n4\n).4(H\n\n2\nO)] \n\nand szomolnokite [Fe(SO\n4\n).(H\n\n2\nO)] were observed and identifi ed also by XRD. Many of the \n\nsecondary minerals present (e.g. sulfates) are mainly controlled by the wet\u2013dry cycles related \nto seasonal variations in rainfall since they tend to precipitate during dry periods and easily \nredissolved during rainfall episodes.\n\nThe dissolution of these sulfate minerals explain the increasing concentrations in SO\n4\n2- and \n\nmetals and the lower pH during the rainy period in this Z\u00eazere river location. Another reason \nis that the percentage of annual seepage volume collected by the collection channel system \nis small. However during the rainy season the discharges of this channel are coincident with \nthe high fl ows in the local streams and rivers (Fig. 2.20a). As a result, untreated AMD is diluted \nby surface water.\n\nSeasonal variability in chemical composition should be restricted to a dilution effect after \nheavy rain, which allows a decrease in the metal contents of the stream waters. The chemical \ncomposition of waters also results from the interaction with the host rock and tailings. During \nthe rainy season, sample ZZ was collected immediately after an heavy rainfall, with a signifi cant \namount of seepage water coming from the Rio tailing draining to the river (Fig. 2.20a). On the \nfollowing days the signifi cant river fl ow and oxygenation will contribute for the dilution and to \na pH increase in the river.\n\nHydrochemical compositions of the water samples were plotted in a Piper trilinear diagram \n(Piper, 1944). According to the diagram for the rainy season samples (Fig. 5.1a) two groups are \nidentifi ed: (a) the Mg2+/Ca2+\u2013SO\n\n4\n2- waters associated with the samples collected downstream \n\nthe tailing; and (b) the Na+/Mg2+\u2013HCO\n3\n- waters located outside the tailing infl uence. Regarding \n\nthe dry season sampling (Fig. 5.1b), Casinhas stream samples, one sample from Barroco stream \nand from Z\u00eazere river are classifi ed as Mg2+/Ca2+\u2013SO\n\n4\n2- type.\n\nA classifi cation based on pH and in a metal group concentration was proposed as the Ficklin \ndiagram (Plumlee et al., 1992, 1994, 1999), considering that Cd, Co, Cu, Pb, Ni and Zn, were \nthe major heavy metals found in water samples. According to the Ficklin diagram for the \nrainy season samples (Fig. 5.2) the seepage waters, collected near Rio tailing, are mainly acid/\nhigh metal and high acid/extreme metal content, while the stream waters from Casinhas are \nclassifi ed as near-neutral and high-metal. The samples from Barroco stream are near-neutral \nand low-metal content and Z\u00eazere river samples are both low metal. Ficklin diagram resulting \nfrom the dry season sampling (Fig. 5.3), groups the Casinhas stream samples as near-neutral \nand high-metal waters and Barroco stream and Rio Z\u00eazere samples as near-neutral and \nlow-metal content.\n\nAccording to Plumlee et al. (1999) the samples classifi ed as high acid and extreme metal \nrich are typical of drainage waters derived from polymetallic deposits characterized by \nlow buffering potential.

Also the Casinhas stream \nsamples have high SO\n\n4\n2- and metal concentrations once the Barroca Grande tailing drains \n\ndirectly to this stream (samples named CS), as referred before. In general these waters, affected \nby the mine, indicate concentrations of SO\n\n4\n2- and metals /metalloids within the normal range \n\nusually reported for sulfi de mineralization\u2019s (Kim and Chon, 2001; Olias et al., 2004; Petrunic \nand Al, 2005; Espa\u00f1a et al, 2005). \n\nAt Barroca Grande, the water is collected, pumped, and neutralized with lime [Ca(OH)\n2\n] at \n\nthe Salgueira water treatment plant (WTP) promoting the metal precipitation and fl occulation \nwhen pH increases. The WTP average fl ow ranges 1,000 m3 h-1 (winter) to 250\u2013300 m3 h-1 \n\n(summer); since the maximum water capacity is of 300 m3 h-1, a signifi cant portion of acid \nwaters are conducted directly to the Casinhas stream without any pretreatment during the \nrainfall season (Reis, 1971; Cavey and Gunning, 2006). The highly acidic water from the tailing \npiles fl ows into nearby streams. In the dry period sampling, an intense pH increasing has \noccurred in sample CS4, which is located immediately downstream the Salgueira WTP. This \nsample was collected after the lime neutralization, reason why the pH increased dramatically. \nThe mine water fl ows seasonally, with minimal base fl ow conditions during the dry season and \nhigh fl ow during the rainy season. \n\nThe tendency of increasing metal contents with decreasing pH is also confi rmed by the plots \nof pH values versus SO\n\n4\n2-, As, Al, Fe and Mn concentrations (Figs. 5.2b to 5.2f and 5.3b to 5.3f) \n\n\n\n80 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1 000\n\n10 000\n\n100 000\n\n1 000 000\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1 000\n\n10 000\n\nA\nl (\nm\n\ng\n L\n\n-1\n)\n\npH\n\n(d)\n\n100 000\n\n1 000 000\n\nSO\n4\n\n(m\ng\n\n L-\n1)\n\npH\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\nAs\n (m\n\ng \nL-\n\n1)\n\npH\n\n(c)\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1 000\n\n10 000\n\nFe\n (m\n\ng \nL-\n\n1)\n\npH\n\n(e)\n\n100 000\n\n1 000 000\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1 000\n\n10 000\n\nM\nn\n\n (m\ng\n\n L\n-1\n\n)\n\npH\n\n(f)\n\n100 000\n\n1 000 000\n\n0\n1\n\nZn\n+\n\nC\nu+\n\nC\nd+\n\nPb\n+\n\nC\no+\n\nN\ni (\n\nm\ng \n\nL-\n1)\n\npH\n\nNear-neutral,\nLow -metal\n\nNear-neutral,\nHigh -metal\n\nAcid,\nHigh -metal\n\nAcid,\nExtreme-metal\n\nAcid,\nLow -metal\n\nHigh-acid,\nExtreme-metal\n\n(a)\n\nincreasing base metal\n\nsulphide content\n\nincreasing dilution by\n\nsurface water\n\nCS7\n\nCS1\n\nB2\n\nCS8\n\nCS6\n\nCS3\n\nZZ\nB1\nCFZ\n\nCFB\n\nCS2\n\nB3\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1 000\n\n10 000\n\n100 000\n\n1 000 000\n\n21 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1 000\n\n10 000\n\n100 000\n\n1 000 000\n\nCS4\nCS7\n\nCS1\n\nB2\n\nCS8\n\nCS6\n\nCS3\n\nZZ\n\nB1\n\nCFZ\n\nCFB\n\nCS2\n\nB3\n\nCS7\n\nCS1\nB2\n\nCS8\n\nCS6\n\nCS3\n\nZZ\nB1\n\nCFZ\nCFB\n\nCS2\n\nB3\n\nCS4\n\n10\n\nCS4\nCS7\n\nCS1\n\nB2\nCS8\n\nCS6\n\nCS3\nZZ\n\nB1\n\nCFZ\n\nCFB\n\nCS2\n\nB3\n\n10\n\nCS7\nCS1\n\nB2\n\nCS8 CS6\n\nCS3\n\nZZ\nB1\n\nCFZ\n\nCFB\n\nCS2\n\nB3\n\nCS4\n\n10\n\nCS4\n\nCS7\n\nCS1\n\nB2\n\nCS8\n\nCS6\n\nCS3\n\nZZ\n\nB1\n\nCFZ\n\nCFB\n\nCS2\n\nB3\n\nCS4\n\nFig. 5.3.

Ions like As are non-conservative \nbecause they are rapidly eliminated during transport (see As/pH projection in Fig 5.2c and Fig \n5.3c) mainly due to coprecipitation with Fe oxyhydroxides and also to clay adsorption, while \nSO\n\n4\n2- is a conservative ion, i.e., stable in solution as can be seen in both SO\n\n4\n2- diagrams.\n\nAMD is controlled by the leaching processes involving sulfi des. Low-pH conditions promote \nthe dissolution of many metal bearing minerals and the metals desorption from solid surfaces. \nThe hydrochemical features in Panasqueira are dominated by the oxidation of Fe-bearing \nsulfi des minerals, namely arsenopyrite, but also pyrite and chalcopyrite, producing H+, SO\n\n4\n2- \n\nand metals (Me). Cidu et al. (1997) proposed the following explanatory oxidation reactions of \nthe sulfi de minerals:\n\n(Fe,Me)S\n2\n + 3.5O\n\n2\n + H\n\n2\nO  Fe\n\naq\n2+,Me\n\naq\n2+ + 2SO\n\n4\n2+ + 2H+ [1]\n\n2Fe\naq\n\n2+ + 0.5O\n2\n + 2H+  2Fe\n\naq\n3+ + H\n\n2\nO [2]\n\nAccording to Blowes et al. (2003) the geochemical reactions occurring in the mine wastes and \nin underlying aquifers results in intense changes in the concentrations of dissolved constituents \nand in the mineralogy and physical properties of the mine wastes and in the aquifer rocks. \nThere is a clear chemical distinction between the different kinds of water in this study: (a) \nsuperfi cial water outside the impacted area \u2013 Barroco stream and CZF sample in Z\u00eazere river, \n\n\n\n81Part II \u2013 Results and discussion\n5.

Sample B2 (dry season) has somehow a signifi cant increase, in \nsulfate ion and trace metals as well as in major ions, which must be studied more deeply to \nunderstand the geochemical reactions inherent to this behavior. \n\nBecause As is a toxic element and because arsenopyrite (FeAsS) is the main sulfi de rejected \nin Panasqueira mine, As and also Fe have been object of chemical speciation according to the \nmethodologies described previously. According to the results (Table 5.3) As and Fe are naturally \npresent in seepage waters (rainy period) due to the surface runoff and percolation that are \nresponsible for the leaching of the tailing materials and formation of these acid drainage. \nLeaching at the Barroca Grande and Rio tailings sites affects the Casinhas stream and Z\u00eazere \nriver hydrochemistry downstream, recorded in the As concentrations of samples CS1 and \nCS2, the nearest ones of the Barroca Grande tailing, and also in sample ZZ located in Z\u00eazere \nriver in the Rio tailing basement. Probably, downstream these location the pH and Eh (more \noxidizing environment) of the river, as well, as microbiological mechanisms, will cause As \nco-precipitation with Fe(III) oxyhydroxides and Mn.\n\nTable 5.3.

The pH and Eh relationship is very important in understanding As \nimmobilization/stabilization on solid phases as well as the distribution of arsenic species \nin water (Wee, 2003). As(V) species are dominant under oxidizing conditions and As(III) is \nthermodynamically stable under mildly reducing conditions. Normally, the Eh values of surface \nwater are high, and low in groundwater. Thus, As(V) is more likely to occur in surface waters \nwhile As(III) tends to occur more frequently in ground waters. As(III) is more mobile because \nis mainly present as a neutral form at the pH of most natural environments (pH &lt;9) so it is \nless strongly adsorbed on mineral surfaces (Korte and Fernando, 1991). Meng et al (2001) \npointed out that three redox zones can be divided according to the arsenic mobility: (1) an \nadsorption zone at pe > 0 (Eh > 0 mV); (2) a mobilization (transition) zone at -4.0 &lt;pe &lt;0 \n\n\n\n82 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\n(-236 mV &lt;Eh &lt;0 mV); and (3) a reductive fi xation zone at pe &lt;-4.0 (Eh &lt;-236 mV). Arsenic \nmobility is greatest in the mobilization zone due to the reduction of ferric oxyhydroxides, main \nadsorbents for arsenic, to ferrous iron and As(V) to As(III). High values of Eh or pe (low electron \nactivity) correspond to oxidizing conditions, and waters with low values of Eh or pe (high \nelectron activity) correspond to reducing conditions. The high Eh values for the rainy season \nsamples correspond to an oxidizing environment being the As dissolved in the arsenate form. \nIt must be pointed out that in Barroco stream whose waters are utilized for irrigation, arsenic \nconcentration is in all samples below the parametric water values for human consumption \naccording to the Portuguese guide values (10 ?g L-1; Decree-Law 306/2007). Regarding to \nthe dry period sampling, the Eh values are lower when compared to rainy sampling but they \nare still high and positive, locating these samples in oxidizing conditions. An exception was \nverifi ed for the CS4 sample, with Eh = -116 mV and pH = 9.5. Arsenic content in CS4 increased \nsignifi cantly due to the pH increase and an Eh value located in the mobilization zone (-236 mV \n&lt;Eh &lt;0 mV) enhancing arsenic mobility. The B2 water sample, from Barroco stream, is used \nfor irrigation by local population and its concentration in the dry season sampling is worrisome \nbecause this water presents As concentrations above the parametric value permitted by the \nPortuguese legislation (Decree-Law 306/2007). Nevertheless, the toxicity of As depends on its \noxidation state and reduced forms are the most toxic. However, in this sample As is present \nmainly as As(V) which represent a lower degree of toxicity.\n\nThe results also show that Fe(III) is dominant in all samples.\n\n5.2. Water rock interaction\n\nThe saturation index (SI) of water samples (determined with the PHREEQC code combined \nwith the WATEQ4F database) showed that the Fe-oxides, Fe/Al-hydroxides, aluminosilicates \nand Al-hydrosulfates are the main mineral groups in which waters tend to become more \nsupersaturated. These phases are very important since they show a high metal(loid)s adsorption \ncapacity. A small number of Ba phases displayed SI > 0 for the majority of the water samples. \nNevertheless, in some water samples the single As mineral phase supersaturated have Ba in \nits composition [Ba\n\n3\n(AsO\n\n4\n)\n2\n].\n\nUnderstanding the distribution of elements in precipitated mineral phases is important for \nthe interpretation of aqueous geochemical data. For instance, aqueous concentrations of Al, \nAs, and Si are elevated in the seepage waters in the oxidation zone and the precipitation of \ngoethite and gibbsite, both with SI > 0, in this zone provides a sink for these elements. Aqueous \nconcentrations of other minor elements, such as Cu, Zn and Mn may also be attenuated by \ngoethite, gibbsite and/or ferrihydrite precipitation in the oxidation zone through adsorption \nprocesses. \n\nAccording to \u00c1vila et al. (2008a) and Paper I (section 4 of this thesis), the mineralogical \ncomposition, of the Rio and Barroca Grande impoundments and tailings, reveals the presence \nof arsenopyrite, scorodite, marcasite, pyrite, mica, quartz, illite, vermiculite, natrojarosite, \nkaolinite, chlorite and montmorillonite. Geochemical calculations suggest that the waters are \nundersaturated with respect to gypsum and calcite and as a result, Ca and SO\n\n4\n2- concentrations \n\nare not limited by the precipitation of gypsum and calcite, being all water samples increased in \ncalcium and sulfate. The source of SiO\n\n2\n, Ca and metals/metalloids, could be attributed to the \n\nsilicate weathering, calcite dissolution and sulfi de-mineral oxidation. Casinhas stream waters \nare mainly saturated or near equilibrium with respect to alunite KAl\n\n3\n(SO\n\n4\n)\n2\n(OH)\n\n6\n, a common \n\n\n\n83Part II \u2013 Results and discussion\n5. Paper II\n\nweathering product of aluminosilicates and pyrite. The long transport of the constituents \nforming these minerals and the possible subsequent deposition of alunite was determined\nby PREEQC.\n\nWhen analyzed individually, the water samples from each location does not present a \nsignifi cant variation between the proportions of the supersaturated phases. However, the \nseepage waters show a higher capacity for mineral dissolution once, in general, have the \nlowest number of phases with SI > 0 and, on the contrary, Casinhas and Barroco streams \nsamples show more predisposition for mineral precipitation.\n\nComparing the rainy and dry seasons samples from Casinhas and Barroco streams and \nZ\u00earere river they do not present signifi cant differences in the supersaturated mineral phases \n(Fig. 5.4a,b), being the silicates and oxides the main phases. Carbonates and sulfates show \nminor differences. The fraction of samples supersaturated in sulfates is higher in rainy season \nthan in dry season, with increasing conditions for carbonate precipitation, possibly due to the \npH and alkalinity increase and sulfate concentration decrease. Seepage waters (Fig. 5.4c) show \na reduced silicate precipitation when compared with the other samples, despite the higher \nmean silica concentrations. Supersaturated phases of sulfates and oxides are dominant in \nthese water samples, due to the low pH values and to the high levels of sulfate and Fe.\n\nFig. 5.4. Distribution of mineral supersaturated phases in water samples collected in (a) rainy season; (b) dry \nseason; and (c) seepage waters.\n\nStudies carried out in the Panasqueira mine and surrounding area (Paper III in section 6; Coelho et \nal., 2013a \u2013 Paper VIII in section 12.5) identifi ed an assemblage of potentially toxic elements to the \nenvironment and to human health. Environmental studies concluded that the most important \ntoxic element present in the environmentally exposed villages is As, revealing in soils and \nstreet dusts high mean concentrations: (a) 103 mg kg-1 in topsoil; (b) 138 mg kg-1 in rhizosphere \nsoil; and (c) 588 mg kg-1 in street dust (Paper VI in section 9 of this thesis). These concentrations \nare much higher than the internationally guide values: (a) 11 mg kg-1 (Ontario soils quality \nguidelines, Ministry of the Environment, 2011); and (b) 20 mg kg-1 (acceptable risk values on \nstreet dusts proposed by Sezgin et al., 2003). Additionally individuals, especially females, \nfrom the same environmentally exposed areas apparently experienced a pronounced and \ncontinuous (past and recent) exposure to As and Mn (Coelho et al., 2013a). On another study \nthe mean potential ecological risk (PERI) computed, classifi ed the topsoil of the Panasqueira \nmine as very high polluted, mostly due to the Cd ecological potential risk (Paper IV, section 7 of \nthis thesis).\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nSilicates Hydroxides Sulfates Carbonates Oxides Phosphates As-Minerals\n\n\n\n84 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\nAccording to the Toxic Substances Portal (http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/, 2013) As and Cd are \ntoxic to humans and classifi ed as human carcinogens (section 12.1 of this thesis). Although \nMn is an essential nutrient to humans, exposure to high levels of manganese might affect the \nnervous system (http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/, 2013).\n\nArsenic speciation performed with PHREEQC code, aid to understand the behavior of As \nspecies in waters. The distribution of arsenic species [As(III) and As(V)] plotted in Fig. 5.5 shows \nthat, markedly, As(V) dominate arsenic species in these water samples. The arsenous acid \n(H\n\n3\nAsO\n\n3\n) is the dominant form of As(III) species, while dihydrogen arsenate (H\n\n2\nAsO\n\n4\n-) and \n\nhydrogen arsenate (HAsO\n4\n2-) are the most signifi cant species related to As(V). \n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nH3AsO3 H2AsO3-\n\n(d) (e) (f)\n\nH2AsO4- H2AsO32- H3AsO4 AsO43-\n\nFig. 5.5.

Thus, \nonce oxidized, As will be present \nin solution in higher pH waters and \nthis was what happened in CS4 dry \nseason sample which presents a \ngeochemically coherent behavior \nwith a pH increase to 9.5 and an As \nrelease to solution (81 ?g L-1). \n\nCadmium and Mn presents as \ndominant species the divalent ions \n(Cd2+ and Mn2+) for both sampling \nperiods.

The 1E-06 value is classifi ed as the carcinogenic target risk. If the cancer risk \nis above 1E-04 is qualifi ed as unacceptable (USEPA, 1989, 2013a; Luo et al., 2012a).

Stream sediments geochemistry and mineralogy\n\nIn order to assess the dynamics of leaching, transport and accumulation of some selected \nmetals and metalloids another sampling media was chosen \u2013 the stream sediments.\n\nAccording to the results presented in Table 5.4 (data related to stream sediments collected \nduring the rainy and dry season), it can be observed that the sediments collected under the \ninfl uence of seepage waters are acidic and good receptors of the majority of the metals and \nmetalloids. The mechanical and chemical dispersion, due to the dynamic of the stream and \nriver surface waters, favors the mobilization and the incorporation of metals, namely, Ag, As, \nCd, Cu, Zn and W, in stream sediments. Anomalous contents of these metals and metalloids \nwere found predominantly in Casinhas stream, downstream Barroca Grande tailing and also \nin the main Z\u00eazere river. Results indicate that the mine might be the main source of chemical \ncontamination in the area. The irregular decay of these anomalous patterns suggests the \ninterference of local hydrological and physiographical factors (expressed by periods of severe \nand wet winters affecting a geomorphologically rugged region) which promote mechanisms \nof fast erosion, transport and accumulation of solid materials, most of which are transported \nin suspension by surface waters.\n\nComparing the results of Fe and metals concentrations in stream sediments and in waters, it is \nevident the high accumulation level of these elements in stream sediments confi rming that the \n\n\n\n87Part II \u2013 Results and discussion\n5.

The \nsmolianinovite [(Co,Ni,Mg,Ca)\n\n3\n(Fe,Al)\n\n2\n(AsO\n\n4\n)\n4\n.11(H\n\n2\nO)] is a secondary arsenate that results as \n\na product of the oxidation of some sulfi de from the primary paragenesis; and (Group III) the \nsample CS4.

Paper III\n\nIntegrated approach to assess the environmental impact of mining \nactivities: Part 1 \u2013 Multivariate statistical analysis to estimate the \nspatial distribution of soil contamination in the Panasqueira mining \narea (central Portugal)\n\nAbstract\n\nIn this study selected geochemical results are presented in order to access a better understanding of \n\nthe dynamics inherent to leaching, transport, and accumulation of some potential toxic elements in soil \n\nand their environmental relevance.\n\nThe principal component analysis revealed the association of the Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, W, Zn elements \n\nwhich are strongly correlated. This group is controlled by the geochemical signature of the Panasqueira \n\nsulfi de mineralization. The Pollution Load Index presented a mean value of 5 and a minimum of 1 on the \n\nupper soil horizon (topsoil), revealing pollution on the global area. Results revealed also that signifi cant \n\nconcentrations of As, Bi, Cd and W are linked to the exchangeable and acid-soluble bearing-phases, \n\nupon which desorption and ion exchange reactions may originate the release of these readily mobile \n\nphases.\n\nLocal wind and hydrological factors are responsible for the elements dispersion. The wind promotes the \n\nmechanical dispersion of the rejected materials, from the milled waste rocks and the mineral processing \n\nplant, stored in the open air impoundments from Barroca Grande and Rio, and their deposition on soils \n\nand waters. Also the As and sulfi de-related heavy metals (such as Cu and Cd) are associated to the \n\nfi ne materials that are transported in suspension by surface waters or associated to the acidic waters, \n\ndraining these sites and contaminating the local soils. Part of this fraction, especially for As, Cd and \n\nCu, is temporally retained in solid phases by precipitation of soluble secondary minerals (through the \n\nprecipitation of hydrated metal sulfates) in warm dry periods, but such minerals are easily dissolved \n\nduring rainy periods.\n\nReference\n\nCarla Candeias, Eduardo Ferreira da Silva, Paula Freire \u00c1vila, Ana Rita Salgueiro, Jo\u00e3o Paulo Teixeira. \n\n2013.

In \nopposition, elements such as Co, Fe, Mg, Mn, Mo and Zn are higher on subsurface soil \nsamples. According to the results it is possible to conclude that topsoil samples points to \nthe anthropic contamination (geochemical signature of the mineralization), while subsurface \nsoils are related to the geogenic features (elements associated to geological formations). The \ncomparison of topsoil and subsurface soil samples mean values with the local geochemical \nbackground values highlighted that As, Bi, Cd and W elements are the most enriched (values \nranging between 4x to 30x). Arsenic and W mean concentrations obtained for both depths \nare signifi cantly higher than the MVPS values (W: topsoil \u2013 13x and subsurface soil \u2013 4x; As: \ntopsoil \u2013 9x and subsurface soil \u2013 7x, see Table 6.1). The mean As values exceeds also the \nEVPS (topsoil \u2013 4x; subsurface soil \u2013 As 3x). In particularly the range of As contents in soils \nis larger than for the other elements in topsoil samples. Table 6.1 shows that, in topsoil, the \nvariables with highest skewness (values > 3.0) are Bi > Ca > As > Cr > W > P > Cu > Ag > Sb > \nTh > Sc > Cd, while in subsurface soils the variables are Ca > Sb > Cr > Bi > P > Ba > Cd > Sr \n> Mo. The asymmetry observed in the data (Table 6.1) is due to the presence of outliers, which \ncan endanger the spatial continuity of the variogram function and produce poor results when \nusing parametric techniques like Ordinary Kriging. However, in this study these diffi culties are \novercome as PCA produces new variables, the PCA components. This method reduces a \nset of observed variables into a smaller set of artifi cial variables called principal components \n(PC). This technique attempts to reveal the correlation structure of the variables allowing \ninterpretation of geological and anthropogenic processes affecting the soil geochemical data. \nIn order to characterize the studied area PCA was applied. A matrix of 117 (samples) x 30 \n(chemical elements) of topsoil samples and a matrix of 113 (samples) x 30 (chemical elements) \nof subsurface soil samples were submitted to PCA. As stated previously, a regular grid (400 \nm x 400 m \u2013 Fig. 2.1d) was used for soil sampling and some of these samples (5 topsoil and 3 \nsubsurface soil) were taken over the tailing, for that reason and because tailing material is not \na soil these samples were removed from the PCA study. \n\nAccording to the Kaiser criterion the number of signifi cant principal components with \neigenvalue higher than 1 were selected (Davis, 1986; Manly, 1994). PCA enabled the extraction \nof fi ve PC\u2019s, for topsoil, explaining 69.09% of the total variance. For subsurface soil also fi ve \nPC\u2019s were defi ned explaining 67.31% of the total variance.\n\nFor topsoil samples the fi rst component (PC1) explains 13 [Ga, Cr, V, Sc, Ni, Fe, Al, Ba, Co, \nTh, La, K, Mg] of the 30 variables with 25.03% of the total variance. Axis 2 (PC2) explains 12 \nvariables [Cu, Cd, Ag, Zn, Sr, Ca, (As), Mn, P, Bi, (W) in opposition to Th \u2013 already explained \nin PC1] with a variance of 17.07%. PC3 explains cleary 5 variables [As, Tl, Bi, Ti in opposition \nto Sr (also explained in PC2)] with 12.92% of the total variance. The fourth component (PC4) \nexplains 2 variables [K, Ti] already explained in PC1 and PC3 respectively and has 8.00% of \nthe total variance. PC5 explains one variable [Se] with 6.07% of the total variance. \n\nThe overview of the most representative variables projections distinguishes the existing \nproximities and oppositions (Cardoso, 1995). Figure 6.1 shows a graphical projection of the \nPCA (topsoil database) of the selected 30 variables coordinates, representing the correlation \ncoeffi cients between them, in the different factorial plans (PC1/PC2; PC1/PC3). Four groups \nof variables can be identifi ed in the three factorial plans.\n\nIn the fi rst factorial plan (PC1/PC2 \u2013 Fig. 6.1a, representing 42.10% of the global information \nof the data set) the selected variables could be separated into three groups. A fi rst group \n\n\n\n93Part II \u2013 Results and discussion\n6.

These two sub-sets allow the \nseparation between the argillaceous shales and the spotted argillaceous shales (Ba, K, Mg, \nNi enrichment \u2013 see Table 6.2).\n\nTable 6.2.

Also the highest concentrations of Bi, Ag and As \nwere found in Rio soil samples. Only Zn presents in Barroca Grande soils slightly higher \nconcentrations than in Rio samples. The concentration factor (CF) values, determined in Rio, \nwere very high mainly due to W (up to 571), Cd (up to 300), Bi (up to 215), Ag (up to 34) and \nAs (up to 14). These values are indicative of serious soil pollution. According to these results, \nthe Rio area contains very high levels of Potentially Toxic Elements (PTE\u2019s), even if the total \nconcentrations are conditioned by the samples locations, for example, As values ranges from \n53 to 3640 mg kg-1, with a mean value of 710 mg kg-1 and a background value of 22 mg kg-1. \nThe total abundance of Ag, Bi, Cd and W mean concentrations are 32, 55, 107 and 245x, \n\n\n\n96 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\nrespectively, higher than the background value defi ned in Casegas area. Although the CF \nvalues, determined for Cu (10) and for Zn (3), are signifi cantly lower than the CF\u2019s determined \nfor the others elements, both Cu and Zn present results above 1 (Table 6.3).\n\nIn Barroca Grande area the PLI results, for topsoil samples, ranges between 2 and 15, with \na mean value of 7. The CF is also high, especially for Cd (up to 150), W (up to 89), Ag (up \nto 20) and As (up to 15). According to these results Barroca Grande contains very high \nconcentrations of Cd, W, Ag and As, being higher than the background levels, respectively, \n47, 30, 5 and 7 times.\n\nSubsurface soils also present higher maximum PLI values in Rio area (up to 15), mostly due to \nthe high concentrations of W, which are 42x higher than the background guide value. Also Cd, \nBi and As present high soil concentrations. Barroca Grande subsurface soil samples present \na higher mean PLI result (7), and also the CF of Cd (up to 150), Bi (up to 51) and As (up to 13) \npresent the higher values. Cadmium, W, Bi and As have the highest concentrations in this \narea, being respectively 32, 17, 9 and 6 times higher than the background values.\n\n6.2. Discussion\n\nOne of the main goals of this study is to assess the extent of the soil pollution due to the \npresent and past mining activities and erosion of the tailing materials. To determine the spatial \ngeochemical structure of the variables defi ned by the PCA experimental variograms were \nconstructed and modeled. All variograms were modeled with exponential functions. Table \n6.4 shows the parameters of model function fi tted to the experimental variograms of the 3 \nPC\u2019s retained and also for the PLI results for each soil type. The estimation of the spatial \ndistribution of each PC and PLI was then achieved by ordinary kriging and the respective \nmaps were produced.\n\nTable 6.4.

It is also important to mention that the Beira Schist Formation was subjected \nto lower greenschist grade regional metamorphism during the early compressive stages \nof the Hercynian Orogeny. Polya (1989) established the following paragenetic association \nfor regional metamorphism of pelitic series: quartz\u2013albite\u2013chlorite\u2013muscovite\u2013paragonite. \nAccording to this author the metasediments presents high Al\n\n2\nO\n\n3\n concentrations and low CaO \n\nconcentrations as confi rmed in Table 6.2. The metasediments with a coarser granulometry \nshow higher SiO\n\n2\n and TiO\n\n2\n concentrations and smaller concentrations of Fe\n\n2\nO\n\n3\n, K\n\n2\nO and Nb. \n\nAccording to Table 6.2, the spotted schists are enriched in As, Mg and Mn when compared \nwith the argillaceous schists sampled in Casegas (background area). Few mafi c rocks \n(dolerites) were observed, particularly near S. Jorge da Beira (NW\u2013SE subvertical). The rock is \nfi ne grained and micro-porphyritic and chiefl y consists of labradorite [(Ca,Na)(Al,Si)\n\n4\nO\n\n8\n], and \n\namphibolitized pyroxene. Also quartz veins, parallel to the schistosity, are related to the low \ngrade of metamorphism (Thadeu, 1951). \n\nThe spatial distribution of topsoil PC2 (positive scores \u2013 Fig. 6.3b) reveals a separation of soil \nsamples infl uenced by the proximity to pollution sources, and also from past mining activities \nduring the WWI and WWII periods (locally named as \u201cKilo\u201d). This group appears to be controlled \nby the geochemical signature of the sulfi de mineralization, once all the elements present in this \nfactor are representative of the paragenesis associated to the different phases. These elements \nstill maintain a close relationship in the secondary environment. Silver minerals with a high \nAg content such as matildite [AgBiS\n\n2\n] may be responsible for a great part of the silver present \n\nin samples. Argentiferous stannite [Cu\n2\n(Fe,Zn)SnS\n\n4\n] will also contribute to the total amount \n\nof silver present in the chalcopyrite concentrate, as stannite is a common minor constituent. \nOther rare minerals such as canfi eldite [Ag\n\n8\nSnS\n\n6\n] and pavonite [(Ag,Cu)(Bi,Pb)\n\n3\nS\n\n5\n] play also a \n\nsubordinate role as contributors of silver. All these minerals mainly occur in chalcopyrite and \nare extracted with the chalcopyrite concentrate. Minor silver, however, is lost in the sulfi de \ntailings (Wimmers, 1983). This can be explained by the presence of some of the matildite in \narsenopyrite, which goes into the tailings. According to Ferreira da Silva et al. (2013, in section \n\nFig. 6.3. Scores values spatial distribution of the selected Principal Components on the simplifi ed map of the \nstudied area (topsoil): (a) PC1 \u2013 Ga, Cr, V, Sc, Ni, Fe, Al, Ba, Co, Th, La, K, Mg \u2013 positive scores; (b) PC2 \n\u2013 Cu, Cd, Ag, Zn, Sr, Ca, As, Mn, P, Bi \u2013 positive scores; and (c) PC3 \u2013 Tl, Ti \u2013 negative scores.

The mud dams (in Rio and Barroca Grande) contain high levels of As, \nCd, Cu and Zn (e-Ecorisk, 2007). According to these authors, the Rio tailing samples contained \nabundant amounts of scorodite [FeAsO\n\n4\n.2H\n\n2\nO], sphalerite [ZnS], wolframite [FeWO\n\n4\n], quartz, \n\nnatrojarosite [NaFe\n3\n(SO\n\n4\n)\n2\n(OH)\n\n6\n], vermiculite [(Mg,Fe,Al)\n\n3\n(Al,Si)\n\n4\nO\n\n10\n(OH)\n\n2\n.4H\n\n2\nO], montmorillonite \n\n[(Mg,Ca)O.Al\n2\nO\n\n3\nSi\n\n5\nO\n\n10\n.nH\n\n2\nO], illite, some silicates like kaolinite [Al\n\n2\nSi\n\n2\nO\n\n5\n(OH)\n\n4\n], and also sulfate \n\nminerals, while in Rio tailings dam, melanterite [Fe(SO\n4\n).7(H\n\n2\nO)] and minor amounts of rozenite \n\n[Fe(SO\n4\n).4(H\n\n2\nO)] and szomolnokite [Fe(SO\n\n4\n).(H\n\n2\nO)] were observed by XRD identifi cation. The \n\nRio dam consists predominantly of quartz, mica, feldspar, illite-vermiculite, arsenopyrite, \nmarcasite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite. Other minerals, like scorodite and natrojarosite, \nare also present. The XRD analysis of the active dam sample of Barroca Grande revealed \nthe presence of scorodite, arsenopyrite, quartz, sphalerite, hematite [Fe\n\n2\nO\n\n3\n], and muscovite \n\n[KAl\n2\n(AlSi\n\n3\nO\n\n10\n)(F,OH)\n\n2\n], while the sample from the old dam of Barroca Grande contained quartz, \n\npyrite, chalcopyrite, wolframite (ferberite), and scorodite (\u00c1vila et al., 2008b). The sample \ncollected in the tailing materials of Barroca Grande consists predominantly of arsenopyrite, \nwolframite (ferberite), quartz and muscovite. The presence of P, Sr and Ca variables in this \nassociation could represent the infl uence of the late carbonate phase of the paragenesis. \nIn this phase is possible to identify calcite [CaCO\n\n3\n] and dolomite [MgCO\n\n3\n]. Other rare \n\nminerals are fi nd such as thadeuite [(Mg(Ca,Mn)(Mg,Fe,Mn)\n3\n(PO\n\n4\n)\n2\n(OH,F)\n\n2\n] and panasqueirite\n\n[(Ca,Mg)PO\n4\n(OH,F)]. Thadeu (1951) refers also the presence of carbonates in metasediments \n\nrelated to the hydrothermal weathering and Bloot and Wolf (1953) relates the presence of \ncarbonates to diagenesis process. Sousa (1985) refers also the occurrence of phosphatic \nlevels, in the conglomeratic sequences.\n\nThe association of group iii is essentially anthropogenic and is related to the minerals belonging \nto the primary paragenesis, such as arsenopyrite [FeAsS]; bismuthinite [Bi\n\n2\nS\n\n3\n] and rutile [TiO\n\n2\n], \n\nrejected during the tungsten separation process and deposition in the tailing and mud dam. \nThe interactions water-minerals at the waste dump surface, leads to the generation of acid \nmine drainage with high contents of metals and sulfate, related to the sulfi des alteration. The \nalteration degree of these sulfi des is recorded in the geochemical evolution of the primary \nparagenesis and leads to the emergence of a new mineralogy with neoformation minerals, \nsuch as scorodite, melanterite, szomolnokite and rozenite. These secondary minerals play an \nimportant role in the natural retention of oxyanions and divalent cations like Cu, Zn and Pb, \nfor example, due to the elements capture by sorption and precipitation and the precipitation \nand dissolution of such secondary minerals are processes strongly infl uenced by seasonal \nwetting and drying cycles. Climate, can be an important instability factor, and in this region \nit is aggressive very hot and dry during summer and very cold, rainy, and windy in the winter. \nDue to these phenomena soils appear to be a good receptor of some of the metals present in \nthe primary and also the secondary mineralogy.\n\nFigure 6.4 shows the spatial distribution of the selected factors of subsurface soils allowing the \nidentifi cation of the geochemical/geological processes within the study area. Table 6.4 shows \nthe parameters of model function fi tted to the experimental variograms of the 4 PC\u2019s retained \nfor subsurface soils.\n\nThe estimated map of the subsurface soil samples PC1 spatial distribution can be observed \nin Fig. 6.4a. High positive values indicate geochemical anomalies lie within the local geology. \nPC1 mapping allow a better separation between the area related to the argillaceous spotted \nschists (B) and the argillaceous schists (A).

In both areas \n(Fig. 6.5) the mine wastes are a mixture of weakly to strongly sulfi dic rock and non-mineralized \nhost rock materials.\n\nAccording to \u00c1vila et al.

The highest PLI values identifi ed near Barroca Grande (I), \nS\u00e3o Francisco de Assis (II) and Rio (III) confi rms that the mechanical and chemical dispersion \ncontinuously occurs from Barroca Grande and Rio tailings and mud impoundments.

Figure \n6.6 shows the geochemical partitioning of some selected elements in those fractions of each \nsample.\n\nAccording to the results, As is linked to sulfi des since a considerable proportion is extracted \nby aqua regia (F4 \u2013 66.7 to 68.4%) which refl ects the presence of arsenopyrite in the analyzed \nsamples. The amorphous and crystalline Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides (F3) are also important \nbearing phases of this element. The percentage of easily mobilized phases is very low (0.04 to \n0.05%) however the related As concentrations values (0.4\u20130.7 mg kg-1) could be considered \nvery high. Silver, Cd, Cu and Mn show similar SCE patterns suggesting that these elements \nare linked to amorphous Fe/Mn oxyhydroxides and also to sulfi de or clay minerals (part of \nthese elements was extracted with aqua regia).

However, considerable proportion of this metal (up to 50% in sample \nA1) appears to be also associated to the remaining silicates. It must be pointed out that the \npercentage of extraction associated to amorphous and crystalline Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides \nranges between 8.3% and 9.4%. The highest percentage of W extraction, related to the \nlast two steps of extraction, shows that W is highly resistant to both chemical and physical \nweathering and can be transported long distances from the source areas. The mobility of \nW is intermediate to low in neutral pH water (Rose et al., 1979). The principal ore mineral, \nwolframite, is similar to cassiterite in resistance to chemical weathering but is somewhat less \nresistant than cassiterite to physical weathering. Tungsten minerals are brittle and readily break \ndown into fi ne particles that disperse in fi ne-grained sediment. Zinc is mainly associated with \nAmorphous Fe oxides and crystalline Mn oxides and clays. The results also show also that a \nsignifi cant percentage of this element could be released under oxidizing conditions.\n\nThe results of the environmental risk assessment according to RAC (Risk Assessment Code) \nshow that most of the elements are classifi ed in the low risk category except Cd that posed \nlow to medium risk (results of % of extraction ranges from 10 to 13% of extraction associated \nto F1). These soluble/exchange fraction (F1) is a loosely bound phase and liable to change with \nenvironmental conditions such as pH changes (Xie et al., 2013). However, metals associated \nwith F2 are thermodynamically unstable and must be considered as direct effect phases. \nConsidering both F1 and F2 results, Ag, Cd, Cu and Zn are classifi ed with very high risk in the \ntwo analyzed samples, while As are classifi ed wirh medium risk. Tungsten presents no risk \nwhich is consistent with his strong resistance to chemical weathering.\n\nConfl ict of interest\n\nThe authors declare no confl icts of interests.\n\n Acknowledgements\n\nThis research is fi nancially supported by FCT \u2013 Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia (grants SFRH/\nBD/63349/2009 and SFRH/BPD/45884/2008).\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Paper IV\n\nIntegrated approach to assess the environmental impact of mining \nactivities: Part 2 \u2013 Potential risk of exposure to hazardous materials in \nthe Panasqueira mining area (central Portugal)\n\nAbstract\n\nThis work was undertaken to determine, mainly, the assessment of soil contamination and the evaluation \n\nof the ecological and human health risks due to exposure to hazardous materials. The metal assemblage \n\nidentifi ed in soils (Ag\u2013As\u2013Bi\u2013Cd\u2013Cu\u2013W\u2013Zn; PTE\u2019s; Paper III in section 6 of this thesis) refl ects the infl uence \n\nof the tailings and open impoundments materials, due to several agents including the wind dispersion \n\nand the subsequent deposition in soils. PTE\u2019s and pH presents positive correlation confi rming that heavy \n\nmetal mobility holds a positive correlation with pH therefore affecting their availability. The contamination \n\nfactor determined has classifi ed 92.6% of soil samples with moderate to ultra-high degree of pollution. \n\nAs for the risk factor for individual element potential pollution factor and potential ecological risk the \n\nresults suggest that As, Cu and Zn presents a low potential ecological risk, W shows a very high risk \n\nin superfi cial soils (topsoil) and Cd presents very high environmental risk. The spatial distribution of the \n\npotential ecological risk index (PERI) has classifi ed the topsoil with a very high ecological risk, consistent \n\nwith wind direction. Non-carcinogenic hazard and carcinogenic risk of topsoil from Panasqueira mine \n\nand surroundings results showed that, for children (1\u20136 years), Ag, Cd, Cu, W and Zn do not present a \n\nnon-carcinogenic hazard but for As the non-carcinogenic hazard is representing a high health risk. The \n\ncarcinogenic risks, both to children and adult reveals a very high cancer risk mostly due to As ingestion.\n\nReference\n\nCarla Candeias, Eduardo Ferreira da Silva, Paula Freire \u00c1vila, Ana Rita Salgueiro, Jo\u00e3o Paulo Teixeira. \n\n2013.

The strongest correlations registered are between Ag/Cu (0.94), As/Ag (0.90) and Bi/W \n(0.90). There is also a positive correlation, but lower, between PTE\u2019s and pH. Several authors \nclaim that heavy metal mobility holds a positive correlation with pH (Yuan and Lavkulich, 1997; \nHettiarachchi et al., 2003; Antoniadis et al., 2008). pH affects heavy metals availability, being \nthe major contributor to the ability of soils for retaining heavy metals in an exchangeable form \n(Zeng et al., 2011). With low SOM the pH values may become relatively more important for the \npartitioning of metals. Most elements are low negatively correlated with SOM. For subsurface \nsoil samples the PTE\u2019s correlation also presents some signifi cant coeffi cients, but lower than \nin topsoil. The stronger correlations are between As/Bi (r = 0.75) and Bi/Cu (r = 0.69). At this \ndepth, pH is also the most signifi cant soil property, presenting positive correlations with the \nPTE\u2019s excepting for W.\n\nFig. 7.3.

In this study two models were formed as \ngrouping variables, (a) depth\u2013SOM and (b) depth\u2013pH. The results of the test between subjects \nfor the independent variables depth and SOM (Table 7.3) showed that depth accounts for \nsignifi cant variations between the group means of: Bi (p = 0.035; ? = 0.050), Cd (p = 0.015; \n? = 0.050) and W (p = 0.009; ? = 0.050).

No signifi cant interaction was highlighted \nbetween the depth and SOM. In the analysis depth\u2013pH (Table 7.4) the ANOVA test showed \nthat there are signifi cant variations with depth for most PTE\u2019s (Ag: p = 0.071, ? = 0.075; As: \np = 0.027, ? = 0.050; Bi: p = 0.001, ? = 0.050; Cd: p &lt;0.001, ? = 0.050 and W: p &lt;0.001; \n? = 0.050) except for Cu and Zn.

(A \u2013 Barroca Grande; \nB \u2013 S. Francisco de Assis; \nC \u2013 Rio).\n\nAccording to results the topsoil mean values of the contamination factor of Bi, Cd and W \npresent extremely high degree of contamination while Ag and As present high contamination \nfactor. The results demonstrated that mC\n\nd\n values vary from the minimum 1.2 to the maximum \n\n149.9 with a mean value of 10.6. The cumulative frequency distribution put in evidence that \nonly 7.4% of the soil samples were classifi ed as nil to low degree of pollution with mC\n\nd \nvalues \n\n<2.0, and the remaining soil samples (92.6%) registered moderate to ultra-high degree of \npollution with mC\n\nd\n values equal or greater than 2.0 (27.9% between 2 ? mC\n\nd\n &lt;4; 27.1% \n\nbetween 4 ? mC\nd\n &lt;8; 19.7% between 8 ? mC\n\nd\n &lt;16; 15.6% between 16 ? mC\n\nd\n &lt;32 and \n\n2.5% between 32 ? mC\nd\n). The enrichment is more pronounced in topsoil (subsurface soil mC\n\nd\n \n\nvalues ranged 1.2 to 26.4). Casegas, fi rstly considerer as a not contaminated site, once is out \nof the mine and winds infl uence, showed a maximum mC\n\nd\n value of 13.1, representing a very \n\nhigh contamination degree, mostly due to Cd and W contamination factors, probably due to \ngeogenic contamination since this is a natural enriched and mineralized zone.\n\nOnce calculated the mC\nd\n values it is now possible to assess the spatial distribution of the \n\nmodifi ed degree of contamination. The fi rst step is the determination of the spatial structure \nof the new variables, for that the experimental variograms were determined and modeled with \nexponential functions, according to the estimated parameters (topsoil: main direction \u2013 90; C\n\n0\n \n\n\u2013 30; C\n1\n \u2013 330; length \u2013 1,200; anisotropy ratio \u2013 1.81 and subsurface soil: main direction \u2013 90; \n\nC\n0\n \u2013 0; C\n\n1\n \u2013 19; length \u2013 900; anisotropy ratio \u2013 2.90). Estimation of the spatial distribution was \n\nthen achieved by ordinary kriging and the respective map produced. In Fig. 7.4 it is possible to \nobserve the mC\n\nd\n spatial distribution revealing areas with very high values.\n\n0\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n4\n\n8\n\n16\n\n32\n\n606000 607000 608000 609000 610000 611000\n4440000\n\n4441000\n\n4442000\n\n4443000\n\n4444000\n\n4445000\n\n4446000\n\n606000 607000 608000 609000 610000 611000\n\nCasinhas stream\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\n(a) (b)\n\nAccording to Fig. 7.4 the samples collected near the Barroca Grande tailing (A), Rio tailing (B) \nand the mud impoundments stand clearly for the most enriched soils in Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, \nW and Zn (100% of both depths samples from Barroca Grande exceeded for As, Bi, Cd and \nW the baseline values for Portugal, while in Rio only Zn present some samples (25%) lower \nthan the guide value). According to \u00c1vila et al. (2008a), the Barroca Grande tailing and open \nimpoundments have high As, Cd, Cu, Pb, W, and Zn concentrations (mean content in the \nmore coarse tailings material As = 7,142 mg kg-1 ; Cd = 56 mg kg-1; Cu = 2,501 mg kg-1; Pb = \n172 mg kg-1; Sn = 679 mg kg-1; W = 5,400 mg kg-1 and Zn = 1,689 mg kg-1and mean content \nin the impoundment material (rejected from the mill operations) As = 44,252 mg kg-1; Cd = 491 \nmg kg-1; Cu = 4,029 mg kg-1; Pb = 166 mg kg-1; Sn = 454 mg kg-1; W = 3,380 mg kg-1 and Zn = \n3,738 mg kg-1). The mineralogy of these tailings was mainly quartz, muscovite, kaolinite, illite-\nmontmorillonite, montmorillonite-vermiculite, and chlorite, and also arsenopyrite, wolframite, \nand natrojarosite. The dams in Barroca Grande may pose a signifi cant potential threat, due to \n\n\n\n112 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\nthe fi ne-grained nature of the materials and its location with respect to the Casinhas stream \nthat cross S. Francisco de Assis village. The XRD analysis of the impoundment material \nrevealed the presence of scorodite, arsenopyrite, quartz, sphalerite, hematite, and muscovite. \nThese tailings and impoundment material are metal-enriched at a level, likely to be toxic to \nthe ecosystem (\u00c1vila et al., 2008a). The concentrations exceed the values defi ned for the 90th \n\npercentile of the South Portuguese Zone (As = 157 mg kg-1; Cu = 108 mg kg-1; Ni = 62 mg kg-1; \nPb = 117 mg kg-1; Zn = 134 mg kg-1) which is indicative of enrichment in trace metals. This Ag\u2013\nAs\u2013Bi\u2013Cd\u2013Cu\u2013W\u2013Zn association is quite logical and linked to the Panasqueira paragenetic \nassociation. The highest mC\n\nd\n values identifi ed near Barroca Grande (A), S\u00e3o Francisco de \n\nAssis (B) and Rio (C) confi rms that the mechanical and chemical dispersion from Barroca \nGrande and Rio tailings and mud impoundments occurs. Most of the samples (90% or higher \nof total samples) collected in Barroca Grande (A), S\u00e3o Francisco de Assis (B) and Rio (C) \nvillages shows mC\n\nd\n values >8.0, clearly showing a very high degree of contamination.\n\n7.1.3. Potential ecological risk factor and risk index\n\nThe topsoil and subsurface soil samples results for individual element potential pollution factor \nand potential ecological risk are presented in Table 7.6. In both depths, As, Cu and Zn presents \nlow potential ecological risk, with mean values&lt;40. W also show a low risk in subsurface soil, \nbut a very high risk in topsoil, while Bi shows a moderate risk in depth and a considerable risk \nin topsoil. Ag is classifi ed with a moderate to considerable ecological risk, while Cd presents \na very high ecological risk in both depths. The topsoil risk factor is ranked as: Cd > W > Bi > \nAg > As > Cu > Zn while for subsurface soil is ranked as: Cd > Ag > Bi > As > W > Cu > Zn. \nThese results suggest a very high environmental risk, especially for Cd.\n\nIn order to estimate the global potential ecological risk in the study area, the PERI was \ncomputed. The median and mean values classify both depths soils with a very high risk (Table \n7.6). The cumulative analysis show that in both depths none of the samples displayed a low \ngrade of risk (<150) and only 7.4% of topsoil presented a moderate risk index. PERI classifi ed \n92.6% of topsoil samples as high to very high ecological risk. The same occurs for 61.2% of \nsubsurface soil, what should be considered as an extensive problem. Figure 7.5 represents the \nPERI spatial distribution. Topsoil have a wide area classifi ed with a very high ecological risk, \nwhich is consistent with the wind direction, the water courses and the actual and previous \nexploration and benefi ciation locations (Fig. 7.5a). The subsurface soil also present a very high \n\nTable 7.6.

These results are consistent \nwith the ones obtained for the individual Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, W and Zn maps (Fig. 7.1, 7.2 and \n7.3) and the mC\n\nd\n map (Fig. 7.4), with the same affected areas.\n\n7.1.4. Human health risk assessment\n\nBoth non-carcinogenic hazard (HQ) and carcinogenic risk (Risk\npathway\n\n) of Panasqueira mine \nand surroundings topsoil, through the different pathways (ingestion, dermal and inhalation), \nwere estimated according to the human health risk assessment model (USDoE, 2013). The \ncumulative hazard index (HI) and total risk (RISK) were also characterized for multi-pathway \nroutes in resident population.\n\nFor the non-carcinogenic effects it was studied the most conservative exposure condition \n\u2013 children (1\u20136 years old). The soils potentially toxic elements defi ned in this study (Ag, Cd, \nCu, W and Zn), apart from As, do not present a non-carcinogenic hazard for children in  the \nPanasqueira area (maximum HI\n\nchild\u2013Ag,Cd,Cu,W,Zn\n ? 0.37). The As non-carcinogenic hazard mean \n\nvalues, estimated for the different exposure routes were HQ\ningAs\n\n (4.34) >> HQ\ndrmAs\n\n (0.36) >> \nHQ\n\ninhAs\n (0.00). HI\n\nchild\u2013As\n values ranged between 0.78\u201369.50, with a mean value of 4.70 ? HQ\n\ningAs\n \n\n(4.34), due to the ingestion hazard quotient ranging between 0.72\u201364.10. These results\n(&lt;1 \u2013 safe level) indicate that there is a cause for concern for the non-cancer health effects \nin children of Panasqueira study area, mainly due to As oral ingestion, with HQ\n\ningAs\n showing \n\nmedian values above one (Fig. 7.6).\n\nThe carcinogenic risk adjusted both to children and adult were studied for the identifi ed PTE\u2019s \nin this study. The median values of the different exposure routes and total risk were estimated. \nTheir mean distribution were RISK\n\ntotal\n (2.62E-04) ? Risk\n\nAs\n (2.62E-04) ? RISK\n\ning\n (2.39E-04) ? \n\nRisk\ningAs\n\n (2.39E-04) >> RISK\ndrm\n\n (2.26E-05) ? Risk\ndrmAs\n\n (2.26E-05) >> RISK\ninh\n\n (1.32E-07) ? Risk\ninhAs\n\n \n(1.32E-07) (Fig. 7.7). The high signifi cance of As to cumulative carcinogenic elements risk is \ndue to the very low risk fi gured by the other elements. Furthermore, the representation of the \nexposure routes are distributed as: (a) Risk\n\ning\n ? Risk\n\ningAs\n ranged 3.97E-05 \u2013 3.53E-03, with \n\nmedian value of 1.52E-04; (b) Risk\ndrm\n\n ? Risk\ndrmAs\n\n ranged 3.76E-06 \u2013 3.34E-04, with median \nvalue of 1.44E-05; and (c) Risk\n\ninh\n ? Risk\n\ninhAs\n ranged 2.21E-08 \u2013 1.96E-06, with median value of \n\n8.38E-08. The cumulative pathway RISK ? RISK\nAs\n\n ranged 4.35E-05 \u2013 3.87E-03, with a median \nRISK of 1.66E-04 mostly due to Risk\n\ningAs\n range.

Paper V\n\nHeavy metal pollution in mine\u2013soil\u2013plant system in S. Francisco de \nAssis \u2013 Panasqueira mine (Portugal)\n\nAbstract\n\nThe oxidation of sulfi des can result in the mobilization and migration of trace metals/metalloids from the \n\nmining wastes into the environment, releasing contaminants into the ecosystem. In order to evaluate the \n\nextent of the environmental contamination impact on agricultural and residential soils due to the mining \n\nactivities it was conducted a geochemical survey in S. Francisco de Assis village. Rhizosphere soil \n\nsamples, vegetables (Solanum Tubersum Sava and Brassica Oler\u00e1cea L.) which constitute an important \n\nportion of the inhabitant\u2019s diet, irrigation waters and street dusts were collected in private residences. \n\nAccording to the Ontario Guidelines (Ministry of the Environment, 2011), the arsenic contents in the \n\nrhizosphere soils exceed 20 times the reference value for agricultural soils (11 mg kg-1). The results \n\nobtained showed that some edible plants frequently used in the region could be enriched in these \n\nmetals/metalloids and may represent a serious hazard if consumed. The potatoes tend to have a \n\npreferential accumulation in the leaves and roots while in cabbages most elements have a preferential \n\naccumulation in the roots. An index of the risk for residents, due to ingesting of these metals/metalloids, \n\nby consuming vegetables grown around the sampling area, was calculated and the result indicates \n\nthat the inhabitants of S. Francisco de Assis village are probably exposed to some potential health risks \n\nthrough the intake of arsenic, cadmium and also lead by consuming their vegetables.\n\nReference\n\nCarla Candeias, Rita Melo, Paula Freire \u00c1vila, Eduardo Ferreira da Silva, Ana Rita Salgueiro, Jo\u00e3o \n\nPaulo Teixeira. 2013.

Rhizosphere soils\n\nThe previous study (see section 6 \u2013 Paper III) determined the contents of selected elements in \nsoils samples, collected in two depths, from superfi cial soil (topsoil, Soil\n\n0\n) and from a depth \n\nof 15 cm (Soil\n15\n\n). Topsoil samples allowed the characterization of superfi cial contamination \ncoming from the tailings, while subsurface samples makes possible the establishment of the \nlocal geochemical background. To evaluate the presence of possible local anomalies, the \nmean, median and maximum contents of the rhizosphere soils (Soil\n\nR\n) were compared with the \n\nsubsurface soil\n \nconcentrations obtained.\n\nTable 8.1 presents the median values of pH and SOM in soil samples. The rhizosphere soil (Soil\nR\n) \n\nshows a median pH of 6.3 and are classifi ed, according to the United States Department of \nAgriculture (www.nrcs.usda.gov), as slightly acid (6.1 &lt;pH &lt;6.5) while the geogenic soils \nfrom 15 cm depth (median pH = 4.2) are classifi ed as acidic soils (3.5 &lt;pH &lt;4.4).

Specifi cally, \npH infl uences chemical solubility and availability of plant essential nutrients, pesticide \nperformance, and organic matter decomposition. SOM serves multiple functions in the soil, \nincluding nutrient storage and soil aggregation (McCauley et al., 2009). \n\nFrom the analysis of Table 8.1, it is also possible to conclude that As, Ba, Cu, Mn, Sr, and Zn show \nlarge variations in mean, median and maximum values. For all these elements, the difference \nbetween both kinds of samples clearly shows that there are higher contents in Soil\n\nR\n when \n\ncompared with local geochemical background. The behavior of the elements in Soil\nR\n may refl ect \n\nthe infl uence of the Barroca Grande tailings and open impoundments, due to wind dispersion\nand deposition. \n\nAccording to \u00c1vila et al. (2008a), the Barroca Grande tailings and open impoundments have \nhigh As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Sn, W, and Zn concentrations (mean content in the more coarse tailings \nmaterial As = 7,142 mg kg-1; Cd = 56 mg kg-1; Cu = 2,501 mg kg-1; Pb = 172 mg kg-1; Sn = 679 \nmg kg-1; W = 5,400 mg kg-1 and Zn = 1,689 mg kg-1 and mean content in the impoundment \nmaterial (rejected from the mill operations) As = 44,252 mg kg-1 ; Cd = 491 mg kg-1; Cu = 4,029 \nmg kg-1; Pb = 166 mg kg-1; Sn = 454 mg kg-1; W = 3,380 mg kg-1 and Zn = 3,738 mg kg-1). \nThe mineralogy of these tailings was mainly quartz, muscovite, kaolinite, illite\u2013montmorilonite, \nmontmorilonite\u2013vermiculite, and chlorite, and also arsenopyrite, wolframite, and natrojarosite \nThe dam in Barroca Grande may pose a signifi cant potential threat due to the fi ne-grained \nnature of the materials and its location with respect to the Casinhas stream that cross SFA \nvillage. The XRD analysis of the impoundment material revealed the presence of scorodite, \narsenopyrite, quartz, sphalerite, hematite, and muscovite. These tailings and impoundment \nmaterial are metal-enriched at a level likely to be toxic to the ecosystem (\u00c1vila et al., 2008a).\n\nThe coexistence of wolframite, cassiterite, sulfi des, carbonates, and silicates is responsible \nfor the peculiar behavior in the tailings surface environment. Weathering of sulfi de-rich \nmaterials results in AMD at the Panasqueira mine. During runoff events, rain water infi ltrates \nthe tailings and dissolves secondary minerals, producing strongly acidic water (pH 3.0; \u00c1vila \net al., 2008a). The low pH keeps the trace elements dissolved and increases remobilization \nand spatial distribution. This scenario leads to the high contents of metals verifi ed in the \n\n\n\n121Part II \u2013 Results and discussion\n8. Paper V\n\nvillage agricultural soils, some of them with acid pH and others near neutral pH (5.1 &lt;pH &lt;\n6.9). According to McCauley et al. (2009) acid conditions occur in soil having parent material \nhigh in silica, high levels of sand with low buffering capacities (ability to resist pH change), and \nin regions with high amounts of precipitation. An increase in precipitation causes increased \nleaching of base cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+) and the soil pH is lowered. Acidic soils are \nmost commonly found in areas where soils were formed from siliceous parental material, \nforest soils and mining sites containing pyrite (McCauley et al., 2009).\n\nConsidering that the sampling area is located in an inhabited village and that the local \npopulation strongly depends on the use of soil for their subsistence (agriculture, cattle \nbreeding and forestry), it is useful to compare the As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, \nSb, Zn concentrations in soil with the reference values proposed by the Ontario soil quality \nguidelines (Ministry of the Environment, 2011) and also with the national median concentrations \nproposed by Ferreira (2004; Table 8.2).\n\nAccording to these values, the soils from SFA exceed, for example, for As twenty times the \nOntario reference value for agricultural soils (11 mg kg-1) and ten times the national median \nconcentrations (22 mg kg-1) proposed by Ferreira (2004). The estimated EI values for soils are \nelevated ranging from 1.0 to 12.2 (Fig. 8.1), mainly due to the presence of signifi cant contents of \nAs, Cu and also Cd and Pb. Comparison to the Ontario guidelines indicates that the majority \nof the samples exceed the severe effect level for As and Cu (100% of samples), Cd (50% of \nsamples), Pb (53% of samples) and Zn (47% of samples), being deemed \u2018\u2018grossly polluted\u2019\u2019. \n\nAccording to Ferreira da Silva et al. (2013; in section 12.5) the high levels of As in these soils \nseems to be linked to sulfi des, since a considerable proportion is extracted by aqua regia \n(F4 \u2013 66.7 to 68.4%). This high percentage associated with sulfi des refl ects the presence of \narsenopyrite in the samples. Amorphous and crystalline Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides (F3) seems \nto be also important metal bearing-phases. The percentage of easily mobilized phases is very \n\nTable 8.2.

Also according to the same author Cd, Cu \nand Pb show high (and similar) partitioning patterns in the studied soil samples (64.8\u201374.4%, \n49.5\u201354.9%, 46.2\u201356.3% of extraction by hydroxylamine leach cold, respectively), suggesting \nthat these may be linked, to some extent, to amorphous Fe/Mn oxyhydroxides. Moreover, \npart of these elements was extracted with aqua regia in both samples, suggesting that these \nelements may also be linked, to some extent, to sulfi de or clay minerals. It was also shown \nthat Cd (10.3\u201313.9% of extraction, 1.9\u20134 mg kg?1 for Cd) were also extracted to a great extent \nwith sodium acetate indicating that the soluble/exchangeable/carbonate fraction is probably \na preferential sink for Cd. \n\nThese elements (e.g. As, Cd or Pb) are the most toxic for humans, as well as for animals and \ncan even lead to death by ingestion in large doses, or over large periods of time. Exposure \nto hazardous elements may have different pathways, being one of them the ingestion of \nvegetables grown on contaminated soils.\n\n8.1.2. Street dusts\n\nStreet dust originated from the interaction of solid and liquid materials are produced from \ndifferent sources and deposited on the streets. The composition and quantitication of chemical \nmatrix of street dusts are indicators of environmental pollution (Banerjee, 2003). Street dusts \nreceives varying inputs of heavy metals from a diversity of mobile or stationary sources \nsuch as vehicles emissions, industrial plants, power generation plants, oil burning, waste \nincineration, construction and demolition activities as well as resuspension of surrounding \ncontaminated soils (Ahmed and Ishiga, 2006; Al-Khashman, 2007; Atiemo et al., 2011). These \ninputs contribute signifi cantly to the pollution of urban environment. This makes the study \nof street dusts important for determining the origin, distribution and level of heavy metal in \nurban surface environments. Elevated levels of heavy metal contents are the result of human \nactivities and as a result, the adverse effects of poor environmental conditions on human \nhealth are most evident in the affected environments.\n\nExposure to heavy metals in street dusts can occur by means of ingestion trough vegetables \nthat grow near streets, inhalation and dermal contact. The adverse effects of heavy metals \nin street dust include respiratory system disorders, nervous system interruptions, endocrine \nsystem malfunction, immune system suppression and the risk of cancer in later life (Ferreira-\nBaptista and De Miguel, 2005).\n\nMost mining and quarrying wastes obtained from grinding of rocks are placed in deposits in \nspecifi c locations/regions and can be reused in earthworks and construction, in particular the \ncoarser fractions. Typical applications include use in asphalt pavements. In the SFA area, the \nmain concern focuses on dust associated with mining operations due to vehicles moving at \nthe top of the Barroca Grande tailings deposit to load the coarse rejected materials from the \nmining exploration (Fig. 8.2).\n\nThe statistical parameters calculated from the \u201ctotal\u201d contents of the street dust samples are \nshown in Table 8.3. It was noticed that some elements have a strong positive asymmetry, due \nto the presence of \u201coutliers\u201d, namely, Ag, As, Au, Ca, Cd, Hg, Mo, Na, Pb, S, Sb, Se and Zn \n(with values above 1.5). Most of these elements present mean values signifi cantly higher than \ntheir median values. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize the most critical elements in \ncontamination terms and as potential hazardous elements.

For a better understanding of the metals behavior in dust samples, this study only \nfocuses on toxic elements Table 8.4 shows, according to Sezgin et al. (2003) the reference \nvalues range, acceptable risk values, and maximum acceptable values and, for comparison, \nthe mean, median and maximum values determined in SFA street dust samples. \n\nTable 8.4.

For a better visualization, Fig. 8.3 shows the cartography of the As, Cd and Cu street \ndust contents according to the reference values presented in Table 8.4.\n\nThese high contents are caused by a great wind dispersion mechanism in this area (see Table \n2.3). According to these results it would be advisable the close monitoring of dust that are \ncarried by the winds from the Barroca Grande tailing and implementing a form of mitigation \nto prevent its deposition in urban areas (in that case in SFA village). Indeed As, by its toxicity, \nmay have chronic health effects that may be local or systemic. The lung cancer is regarded \nas the most critical effect that results from inhalation of particles of arsenic (WHO, 2000). \nCadmium when present in the atmosphere and in food can cause severe kidney problems. \nMoreover the dispersion of Pb existing in dusts, if particles are at an inhaled size, e.g. PM\n\n10 \n\nand PM\n2.5\n\n, could be worrying, especially for children, primarily due to blood diseases which \nbecome frequent when humans are exposed to this element (WHO, 2000).\n\n8.1.3. Waters\n\nIn SFA the local population strongly depends on the use water (water supply and agriculture), \nnevertheless most of the inhabitants use the public supply network. In the study area, it was \nchosen to perform the collection of water samples in private wells (UW4, UW6, UW7), another \nsample was collected in a little stream (Barroco; UW5), and for comparison two samples from \npublic supply network (UW1, UW8). All of these waters are used for vegetables irrigation  by \nthe local population (Table 8.5). \n\n\n\n125Part II \u2013 Results and discussion\n8. Paper V\n\nFig. 8.3.

The other samples have \ncircumneutral pH. The measured values of electric conductivity ranging from 18 to 161 ?S \ncm-1 classifi es these waters with very low mineralization, according to the parametric values \nset out in the Decree-Law 306/2007 with values up to 2,500 ?S cm-1. These samples have \nlower SO\n\n4\n2- and Cl- concentrations but major ions contents tend to increase with the decrease \n\nof pH. Have also low metal concentrations, sometimes Zn and Mn were present in signifi cant \nconcentrations though below the standard parametric values. The concentrations of other \nelements were all legally acceptable. \n\nFig. 8.4 shows the samples representation in a Piper\u2019s diagram. Two distinct hydrochemical \nfacies were determined: (a) UW1, UW8 from public network supply, UW5 from Barroco stream \nand the well UW6 are Ca2+/Mg2+\u2013HCO\n\n3\n- waters, and (b) UW4 and UW7 collected in private \n\nwells have a closer facies to the type Ca2+/Mg2+\u2013Cl-/SO\n4\n2- waters.  \n\nComparing the obtained results from the collected samples with the Portuguese criteria values \nof quality of surface fresh water for human consumption and irrigating waters (Portuguese \nDecree-Law 306/2007), all the analyzed waters in SFA village are in perfect conditions to be \nused by the population.\n\nNevertheless, and because As is a toxic element and once arsenopyrite is the main sulfi de \nrejected in Panasqueira mine, As and also Fe have been object of chemical speciation \naccording to the methodologies described previously. According to the results of Table 8.6, it \ncan be stated that As is present only in UW5 sample in the form of As(V), nevertheless below \nthe parametric water values for human consumption according to the Portuguese Law. The \ntoxicity of As depends on its oxidation state and knowing that its reduced forms are the most \ntoxic, it was of extremely importance its determination because it allowed the verifi cation that \nthe As in UW5, which is used for irrigation, is present in its oxidized form and hence with a \nlower degree of toxicity. The results also show that Fe(III) is dominant in all samples.\n\n\n\n127Part II \u2013 Results and discussion\n8.

Vegetables\n\nMany heavy metals exist in minute amounts in natural agricultural soil, however when their \namounts exceed a certain level due to pollutants brought from outside, soil contamination \noccurs and agricultural products become contaminated so the consumption of locally \nproduced vegetables may be an important exposure pathway for soil contaminants due to \nagricultural land use. Prolonged exposure to heavy metals can cause deleterious health effects \nin humans. Hence, prediction of metal and metalloid uptake by vegetables from contaminated \nsoils is an important part of the Human health risk assessment. \n\nGiven the high contents, of some metals/metalloids, that were recorded in the soils as well as in \nthe street dusts and the fact that most inhabitants have a diet rich in vegetables, we attempted \nto study the relationship between the metals/metalloids contents of the rhizosphere soils \nand vegetables. Two species were analyzed, Solanum Tubersum Sava (potato) and Brassica \n\nFig. 8.4. Plot of data of water samples collected in S. Francisco de Assis village \u2013 Panasqueira mine, in the Piper\u2019s \ndiagram.\n\n\n\n128 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\nOler\u00e1cea L. (cabbage). For each sample it was calculated the total content of the elements \naccording to equation (16, section 3.3), taking into consideration the different parts of each \nvegetable. Trace elements concentrations found in vegetables were summarized in Table 8.7. \nAnalysis of the results shows that the concentration of some potential hazardous elements \nranges from 1\u201314 mg kg-1 As; 0.1\u20130.1 mg kg-1 Cd; 4\u201320 mg kg-1 Cu; 21\u2013270 mg kg-1 Mn, \n0.2\u20134.2 mg kg-1 Pb and 35\u2013177 mg kg-1 Zn. Data also show that element uptake is different \nin both studied species, the highest concentrations of As, Pb, Zn and Mn accumulation were \nfound in cabbages, while potatoes concentrate more Cd and Cu. \n\nComparing the obtained results of the metal/metalloids contents in vegetables with the \nguidelines for vegetables proposed by FAO/WHO (As = 0.1 mg kg-1; Cd = 0.1 mg kg-1; Cu = \n73 mg kg-1; Pb = 0.2 mg kg-1; Zn = 100 mg kg-1; Mn = 500 mg kg-1; www.codexalimentarius.\norg) it is possible to say that As, Cd and Pb contents are above the maximum allowed level for \nvegetables while Cu, Zn and Mn contents are below the guidelines for maximum allowed metals \nin vegetables. On the whole, all vegetables that were studied in this study were contaminated \nby arsenic, cadmium and lead and they are toxic if continually consumed. Consumption of \nheavy metals-contaminated food can seriously deplete some essential nutrients in the body \ncausing a decrease in immunological protection, intrauterine growth retardation, impaired \npsycho-social behavior, disabilities associated with malnutrition and a high prevalence of \nupper gastrointestinal cancer (Arora et al., 2008).\n\nTables 8.8 and 8.9 presents the concentrations distributed by the different components (T \u2013 \ntubercles, L \u2013 leaves, S \u2013 stems and R \u2013 Roots) of the two studied species Solanum Tubersum \nSava and Brassica Oler\u00e1cea L.\n\nTable 8.7.

Despite the edible parts of vegetables, potatoes \ntubers and cabbage leaves have the lowest As contents, these contents are above the \nmaximum permitted level for vegetables proposed by FAO/WHO guidelines (0.1 mg kg-1; www.\ncodexalimentarius.org). As for Cd, the higher concentration in potatoes is found in roots (5 mg \nkg-1) and in tubers (0.5 mg kg-1) both above the FAO/WHO guidelines for Cd (0.1 mg kg-1; www.\ncodexalimentarius.org) and for leaves cabbages Cd have a maximum concentration of 0.4 mg \nkg-1 and for cabbages, the roots also have the highest Cd contents (0.6 mg kg-1), again both \nabove the maximum limit considered by the FAO/WHO guidelines (www.codexalimentarius.\norg). Due to the high contents of exchangeable Cd in vegetable soils, the Cd in the edible \nparts of vegetables probably came from the root uptake from soils.\n\nCopper is below the maximum limit regarding the FAO/WHO guidelines (73 mg kg-1; www.\ncodexalimentarius.org) in all parts of the plant of both vegetables, and the same pattern is \nobserved for Zn (max limit permissible 100 mg kg-1) in the potatoes but some cabbages \nhave concentrations above the permissible limit. Nevertheless Cu reveals a preferential \naccumulation in the leaves and roots in the potatoes and Zn cumulates in the stems, and in \ncabbages Cu prefers to cumulate in roots and Zn also in the roots. \n\nMetals (Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn) are very tightly bound to the soil at high pH and are therefore \nmore available at low pH levels than high pH levels. In addition to the effects of pH on nutrient \navailability, individual plants and soil organisms also vary in their tolerance to alkaline and/or \nacid soil conditions. Neutral conditions appear to be best for crop growth. As stated beforre \nin rhizosphere soils discussion, the pH of the sampled soils ranged 5.1 &lt;pH &lt;6.9 which is \nthe considered pH range more favorable for micronutrients availability. \n\nAccording to equations (17) and (18; section 3.3), an index of the risk for residents, due to the \ningestion of these metals/metalloids by consuming vegetables grown around the sampling area \nwas calculated on the basis of the oral reference dose being 0.5 ?g kg?1 d?1 for As, 0.5 ?g kg?1 d?1 \nfor Cd, 40 ?g kg?1 d?1 for Cu, 3.5 ?g kg?1 d?1 for Pb, and 300 ?g kg?1 d?1 for Zn (Luo et al., 2011a;\nJECFA, 1993).\n\nAccording to Table 8.10 the risk index, in descending order is Cd > As > Pb > Cu > Zn. The \nrisk index for Cd, As and Pb was higher than 1, while the risk index for Cu, and Zn was less \nthan 1. The result indicates that the inhabitants of SFA village probably are exposed to some \npotential health risks through the intake of As, Cd and also Pb via consuming their vegetables. \nThe accumulation of metals in the edible parts of vegetables could have a direct impact \non the health of nearby inhabitants, because vegetables produced from gardens are mostly \n\nTable 8.10.

(2011a), when determining the risk index, it was assumed that the \nintake is equal to the absorbed dose (USEPA, 1989), which may magnify the effect of the \ningested contaminants to some extent, because part of the heavy metals that were ingested \nmaybe egested. From this point of view, it was reasonable that no obvious adverse health \neffects from exposure to the heavy metals could be observed on those living in the village. \n\nAccording to Luo et al. (2011a) and comparing the results with other studies (Table 8.11), the \nhealth risk for adults from consuming vegetables in this region is comparable to, or even \nhigher than those associated with the consumption of vegetables from gardens impacted by \nmining, wastewater, irrigation or smelting activities.\n\nTable 8.11.

The factors that affect the thresholds of heavy metal toxicity in soil-vegetable \nsystem include the soil type (soil pH, organic matter content, clay mineral and other soil \nchemical and biochemical properties) and the vegetable species, the transport and heavy \nmetal accumulation in each plant. Also the interactions between soils, the plant roots and \nmicrobes play an important role regarding the heavy metal movement from soil to the edible \nparts of crops (Islam et al., 2007). These are issues that can affect bioavailability and heavy \nmetals accumulation in vegetables, subject for a further investigation.\n\n\n\n132 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\nConfl ict of interest\n\nThe authors declare no confl icts of interests.\n\n Acknowledgements\n\nThis research is fi nancially supported by FCT \u2013 Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia (grants SFRH/\nBD/63349/2009 and SFRH/BPD/45884/2008).\n\n\n\n9.

Rhizosphere soils, waters and street \n\ndusts were analyzed in order to establish the toxic elements concentrations in an environmental exposed \n\narea and in background area.

These conclusions \n\nwere refl ected, to some extent, in the biological analysis where signifi cant results for several elements \n\nin different matrices, namely total amounts of As, Cd, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni and Zn, were obtained.

Paper VI\n\n9.1. Results and discussion\n\nThe results obtained in previous environmental studies performed in the surroundings of the \nPanasqueira mine reported a high degree of contamination by several metal(loid)s (e-Ecorisk, \n2007; \u00c1vila et al., 2008a,b; Grangeia et al., 2011; Ferreira da Silva et al., 2013).\n\nThe environmental analysis of the topsoil and 15 cm depth soils (subsurface), on a 32 km2 \narea surrounding the Panasqueira mine (see Paper III in section 6), identifi ed an assemblage \nof potentially toxic elements (Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, W and Zn). The potential ecological risk \nindex classifi ed 92.6% of topsoil samples with high to very high ecological risk (see Paper \nIV in section 7) These fi ndings were accompanied by biomonitoring studies which found \nhigher concentrations of metal(loid)s, specifi cally As, Cr, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb and Zn in the blood, \nurine, nails and hair of individuals living near or working in the mine (Coelho et al., 2013a, in \nsection 12.5, Paper VIII). Additionally results also showed an increase in genotoxic damage and \nimmunotoxic effects in these populations (Coelho et al., 2011b, 2012, 2013b).\n\nThe present study aims to establish the missing link between the environmental contamination \nby metal(loid)s and the internal dose in the Panasqueira region. For this purpose several \nenvironmental media and biomarkers of internal dose were analyzed, including topsoil, \nsubsurface soil, rhizosphere soil, vegetables, street dusts and superfi cial and irrigation water \nsamples, linked to the quantifi cation of several metal(loid)s in blood, urine, nail and hair \nsamples. The conjugation of both studies defi ned the elements As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, \nPb and Zn as the target of this work.\n\nMost metal(loid)s are very toxic to living organisms and even those considered as essential can \nbe toxic when in excess. They can disturb important biochemical processes, constituting an \nimportant threat for the human health. Major health effects include development retardation, \nendocrine disruption, kidney damage, immunological and neurologic effects, and several \ntypes of cancer (Mudgal et al., 2010). Certain metal(loid)s are known to induce genotoxicity, \nand are known to originate cancer in a variety of animal species. Based on epidemiological \ndata, metal(loid)s like As, Cd. Cr and Ni were classifi ed by IARC as human carcinogens (http://\nmonographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classifi cation/Classifi cationsGroupOrder.pdf).\n\n9.1.1. Environmental monitoring\n\nThe environmental studies revealed high As concentrations in rhizosphere soil, topsoil and \nstreet dusts, both in control and environmental exposure areas (Table 9.1). \n\nExposed rhizosphere soil and topsoil present mean concentrations, respectively, 13x and \n9x higher than the Ontario soils quality guidelines (11 mg kg-1; Ministry of the Environment, \n2011). Additionally street dusts showed mean values 29x higher than the acceptable risk \nvalue (20 mg kg-1) proposed by Fabis (1987; Sezgin et al., 2003). The street dust sample \ncollected on the S. Francisco de Assis village main road, located near Barroca Grande tailing, \npresented the maximum concentration of As (3,565 mg kg-1), being 178x higher than the \nacceptable risk. Arsenic concentrations in the study areas are explained once the main mineral \nexisting in the Panasqueira deposit is arsenopyrite (FeAsS). Also exist on other minerals \nidentifi ed in this area, such as arseniosiderite (Ca\n\n2\nFe3+3O\n\n2\n(AsO\n\n4\n)\n3\n.3H\n\n2\nO), farmacossiderite\n\n(KFe\n4\n3+[(OH)\n\n4\n.((AsO\n\n4\n)\n3\n).6-7H\n\n2\nO), scorodite (FeAsO\n\n4\n.2H\n\n2\nO), lollingite (FeAs\n\n2\n) and freibergite \n\n((Ag,Cu,Fe)\n12\n\n(Sb,As)\n4\nS\n\n13\n). The high concentrations associated with the control areas might be \n\nexplained by mechanical wind dispersion.\n\n\n\n136 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\nTable 9.1.

Paper VI\n\nRhizosphere soil samples reveal mean Cd concentrations slightly below the Ontario soils \nquality guidelines (0.9 mg kg-1; Ministry of the Environment, 2011; Table 9.1). Nevertheless, \nthe maximum concentration on agricultural soils is over 3 times the guide value. This value \nmight pose a threat to humans once absorbed Cd is excreted very slowly, accumulating \non the human body. Street dust samples revealed a mean concentration of 4 mg kg-1. The \nmaximum value was of 19 mg kg-1, 6x higher than the maximum acceptable value (3 mg \nkg-1) proposed by Fabis (1987; Sezgin et al., 2003). According the WHO (http://www.who.int/, \n2013) Cd exerts toxic effects on the kidney, the skeletal and the respiratory systems, and is \nclassifi ed as a human carcinogen, being inhalation on of the main exposure routes.\n\nAnother metal existing in high concentrations in street dusts is Cu. The existence of Cu in \nthe study area is mainly due to the presence of chalcopyrite (CuFeS\n\n2\n; one of the by-products \n\nof the Panasqueira mine), chalcocite (Cu\n2\nS), covellite (CuS), cubanite (CuFe\n\n2\nS\n\n3\n), freibergite \n\n((Ag,Cu,Fe)\n12\n\n(Sb,As)\n4\nS\n\n13\n), pavonite ((Ag,Cu)(Bi,Pb)\n\n3\nS\n\n5\n), stannite (Cu\n\n2\nFeSnS\n\n4\n) and tetrahedrite \n\n((Cu,Fe)\n12\n\nSb4S\n13\n\n) minerals on the Panasqueira mine surrounding area. The Cu mean contents \nin street dusts of environmentally exposed areas is over 5x higher than the acceptable risk \nvalue proposed by Fabis (1987; Sezgin et al., 2003). Also in rhizosphere soil samples the \nmean concentrations (Table 9.1) exceeds the recommended by the Ministry of the Environment \n(2011). Although low levels of copper are essential for humans, high absorption of Cu can be \ntoxic to humans causing, among others, diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, and even death \n(http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/, 2013).\n\nZinc occurs in the Panasqueira mining area mainly due to the existence of sphalerite (zinc \nsulfi de; (Zn,Fe)S; ~67% Zn) and smithsonite (zinc carbonate; ZnCO\n\n3\n; ~52% Zn) minerals. \n\nOnce this metal does not occurs freely in the environment it is considered that one of the \nmain anthropogenic sources is mining activities (ATSDR, 2005c). Zinc mean concentrations in \nstreet dusts samples, in the environmentally exposed area, are higher than the acceptable risk \nvalues. Rhizosphere soils and topsoil do not reveal mean concentrations above the Canadian \nguidelines (Table 9.1). Although zinc is essential to humans, high doses can cause clinical \nsymptoms of gastrointestinal distress (http://www.epa.gov/, 2013).\n\nFor Mn, like Fe an abundant element in soils, there is no limit on their concentrations. Sezgin \net al. (2003) determined mean Mn concentrations of 398 mg kg-1 in street dusts, a value \nsimilar to the ones of this study on control area (397 mg kg-1) and lower than the environmental \nexposed area (469 mg kg-1; Table 9.1). \n\nBoth non-carcinogenic hazard (HQ\nchild\n\n) and carcinogenic risk (Risk) of the environmentally \nexposed area, through the different pathways (ingestion, dermal and inhalation), were estimated \naccording to the human health risk assessment model (USDoE, 2013). The cumulative hazard \nindex (HI\n\nchild\n) and total risk (RISK) were also characterized for multi-pathway routes for resident \n\npopulation. Results are presented in Table 9.2.\n\nTable 9.2.

The street dusts of the elements selected in this study (Cd, Cr, \nCu, Pb, Mn, Mo, Ni and Zn), apart from As, do not present a non-carcinogenic hazard for \nchildren in Panasqueira area (maximum HI\n\nchild-Ag,Cd,Cu,W,Zn\n ? 8.55E-01 &lt;1.00E+00). Arsenic \n\nconcentrations present in the street dust samples show a non-carcinogenic risk of 2.72E+01 \n? HI\n\nchild\n (2.75E+01), being ingestion the most signifi cant route of exposure (Table 9.2).\n\nThe street dusts carcinogenic risk adjusted both to children and adult was also computed \nfor the selected elements (Table 9.2). Also arsenic and ingestion pathway are more signifi cant \nin this analysis. The estimated mean risk of the environmentally exposed area is 1.51E-03. \nThis value represents a probability of 2 out of 1,000 persons might develop cancer. Both S. \nFrancisco de Assis and Barroca, the environmentally exposed villages selected for this study, \nare located downstream Barroca Grande tailing and next to Rio tailing, respectively (Fig. 9.1) \nwhat induces this high concentrations of toxic elements in the street dusts.\n\nFig. 9.1.

The collected \nwaters where selected by inhabitants use on a daily base. The two public tap water samples \ncollected in S. Francisco de Assis and Barroca villages showed a reasonable carcinogenic risk \n(4.49E-05 and 1.179E-05, respectively) for As, mostly by ingestion once inhalation and dermal \nrisk are absent (<1.00E-07). Although these waters As concentration are below the limits of \nthe Portuguese standards (<10 ug L-1; Decrew-Law 306/2007), the USDoE (2013) standards \nconsider these waters as above the carcinogenic target risk (1.00E-06). The well water \nsamples from both villages ranged from 3.36E-05 to 1.75E-04. The questionnaire performed \nallowed to establish that this last water sample is used for irrigation and also for a small pool \nwhere children swims seasonally. The street dust sample carcinogenic risk associated with \nthis water is of 1.56E-03, representing a probability of ~2 out of 1,000 persons might develop \ncancer by ingested/inhaled particles, due to the high As concentration. Also local spring waters \nwere analyzed and presented a carcinogenic risk of 8.30E-05 to 2.02E-05. The streams and \nZ\u00eazere river samples collected are used for vegetables irrigation and occasionally for swim \nby local younger inhabitants: (a) Barroco stream samples in S.

Results \nobtained for the urine samples are higher than the published reference ranges and within the \nranges for the rest of the matrices. Arsenic showed strong correlations between matrices \ncompatible with the presence of recent (blood and urine) and past (nails and hair) exposure. \nThis is in agreement with the results obtained for the environmental samples, where As plays \na central role in the existent contamination.\n\nRegarding As speciation analysis (Table 9.4) obtained results show that all the species have \nsignifi cantly higher concentrations in the exposed group when compared to controls, except \nfor arsenobetaine (AsB). \n\nTable 9.4.

The toxicity of As in humans is \ndependent on its chemical form with both arsenite [As(III)] and arsenate [As(V)] being the most \ntoxic, monomethylarsonous acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinous acid (DMA) are less toxic, and \narsenobetaine (AsB), which is mainly found in seafood, being considered non-toxic (Brima et \nal., 2006). There is strong evidence that chronic exposure to inorganic As (iAs) is related with \nseveral adverse health effects such as skin lesions, cardiovascular diseases and metabolic \ndisorders (Fillol et al., 2010). Recently, the existence of more toxic species in urine \u2013 DMA(III) \nand MMA(III) \u2013 has been suggested by several publications but the existence of such species \nit was also been questioned (Morton and Leese, 2011).\n\nOur results (Figs. 9.2 and 9.3) show as previously mentioned all the species having signifi cantly \nhigher concentrations in the exposed group (except for AsB) and agree with the results obtained \nfor the other matrices (blood, nails and hair). This points to populations being exposed to high \nquantities of iAs which is related to the mining activities in the Panasqueira mine. They also \nagree with the results previously published (Coelho et al., 2011b, 2012, 2013a). Results show \nhigher concentrations of all species when compared to results obtained in other studies for \npopulations exposed and unexposed to As (Brima et al., 2006; Fillol et al., 2010; Heitland and \nK\u00f6ster, 2009; Morton and Leese, 2011).\n\nRegarding the effect of gender, our results show that females have higher mean concentrations \nof As\n\ntotal\n and As(III), DMA, MMA and AsB while males presents highest values in values As(V). \n\nBerglund et al. (2011) reported that females seemed to be more at risk for toxic metal exposure \nthan males, and this founding was confi rmed in our study, where females had signifi cantly \nhigher levels of As. Concerning the effect of age, we found older individuals having higher \n\n\n\n141Part II \u2013 Results and discussion\n9. Paper VI\n\nAs\ntotal\n\n and As(III), DMA, MMA and AsB concentrations in urine and younger individuals having \nhigher As(V) concentrations These differences, besides different patterns of exposure, may \nbe due to different toxicokinetic rates, possibly because of the lower proportion of water in \nthe organism, lower absorption and excretion rates, and possible nutritional defi ciencies, and \ncomorbidities in older individuals.\n\nFinally, the analysis of the effect of smoking showed as smokers have signifi cantly higher \nconcentration of As(V) when compared to As\n\ntotal\n and As(III), DMA, MMA and AsB concentrations.\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\nU\nrin\n\ne \nAs\n\nto\nta\n\nl\n(u\n\ng \ng-\n\n1\ncr\n\nea\nt)\n\ncontrol group environmentally exposed group\n\n15\n\n0\n\nU\nrin\n\ne \nAs\n\n(II\nI) \n\n(u\ng \n\ng-\n1\n\ncr\nea\n\nt)\n\n10\n\n5\n\nU\nrin\n\ne \nAs\n\n(V\n) (\n\nug\n g\n\n-1\ncr\n\nea\nt)\n\n17\n\n0\n\nAg\nric\n\nult\nur\n\ne:Y\nes\n\nFe\nma\n\nle\nMa\n\nle\n\nNe\nve\n\nr s\nmo\n\nke\nr\n\nSm\nok\n\ner\n an\n\nd e\nx-\n\nsm\nok\n\ner\n\nFis\nh:0\n\n-2\n po\n\nrti\non\n\ns/w\nee\n\nk\n\nFis\nh:>\n\n2 p\nor\n\ntio\nns\n\n/w\nee\n\nk\n\n20\n-4\n\n5 y\nea\n\nrs\n\n45\n-6\n\n5 y\nea\n\nrs\n\n65\n-9\n\n5 y\nea\n\nrs\n\ndr\nink\n\n bo\nttle\n\nd w\nate\n\nr\n\ndr\nink\n\n ta\npw\n\nate\nr\n\ndr\nink\n\n w\nell\n\nsp\nrin\n\ng w\nate\n\nr\n\nAg\nric\n\nult\nur\n\ne:\nNo\n\nPe\nsti\n\ncid\ne:Y\n\nes\n\nPe\nsti\n\ncid\ne:\n\nNo\n\nAg\nric\n\nult\nur\n\ne:\nYe\n\ns\n\nFe\nma\n\nle\nMa\n\nle\n\nNe\nve\n\nr s\nmo\n\nke\nr\n\nSm\nok\n\ner\n an\n\nd e\nx-\n\nsm\nok\n\ner\n\nFis\nh:0\n\n-2\n po\n\nrti\non\n\ns/w\nee\n\nk\n\nFis\nh:>\n\n2 p\nor\n\ntio\nns\n\n/w\nee\n\nk\n\n20\n-4\n\n5 y\nea\n\nrs\n\n45\n-6\n\n5 y\nea\n\nrs\n\n65\n-9\n\n5 y\nea\n\nrs\n\ndr\nink\n\n bo\nttle\n\nd w\nate\n\nr\n\ndr\nink\n\n ta\npw\n\nate\nr\n\ndr\nink\n\n w\nell\n\nsp\nrin\n\ng w\nate\n\nr\n\nAg\nric\n\nult\nur\n\ne:\nNo\n\nPe\nsti\n\ncid\ne u\n\nsa\nge\n\n: Y\nes\n\nPe\nsti\n\ncid\ne u\n\nsa\nge\n\n: N\no\n\n10\n\n5\n\n15\n\nFig. 9.2.

This point to \ncontrols being exposed to high levels of Cu which is in agreement with the results obtained \nin Coelho et al. (2013a) but not on agreement with the results obtained for the environmental \nsamples. Nevertheless, one can hypothesize if the fact that exposed populations are exposed \nto high levels of Zn does not interfere with the levels of Cu, as it is widely known that the \nabsorption of high levels of Zn suppresses the absorption of Cu and Fe (Fosmire, 1990).\n\nResults of Zn quantifi cation showed signifi cant differences in blood and hair samples (Table \n9.3) with the exposed group presenting higher values when compared to controls. Results \nobtained for blood samples are extremely higher than the published reference ranges, \nfi ngernail samples are slightly higher and the rest of the matrices are within the ranges. This \npoint to populations having a continuous exposure to Zn which is in agreement with the \nresults obtained in Coelho et al. (2013a) and with the results obtained for the environmental \nsamples.\n\nConcerning Cr and Pb quantifi cation results did not show signifi cant differences (Table 9.3) \nbetween the two groups. Results obtained for Pb in urine samples are higher than the published \nreference ranges and the rest of the matrices for both elements are within the ranges. This \npoint to populations not having a clear exposure to Cr and Pb which is in agreement with the \nresults obtained in Coelho et al. (2013a) and with the results obtained for the environmental \nsamples which show similar levels of these elements in samples from both areas \u2013 exposed \nand control.\n\nResults of Mn quantifi cation shows signifi cant differences in blood and toenail samples (Table \n9.3) with the exposed group presenting higher values when compared to controls. Levels of \nMn in urine and blood present higher values than the published reference ranges and the \nrest of the matrices are within the ranges. Although Mn is an essential nutrient to humans, \nexposure to high levels of manganese might affect the nervous system (http://www.atsdr.cdc.\ngov/, 2013). These results point to populations having a continuous exposure to Mn which \nis not in agreement with the results obtained in Coelho et al. (2013a) and with the results \nobtained for the environmental samples which show similar levels of this element in samples \nfrom both areas \u2013 exposed and control.\n\nResults of Mo and Ni quantifi cation show signifi cant differences in blood and hair samples \n(Table 9.3) with the exposed group presenting higher values when compared to controls. \nResults obtained for both elements in blood samples are higher than the published reference \nranges and the rest of the matrices for elements are within the ranges. These results point \nto populations having a recent exposure to Mo and a not clear exposure to Ni which is in \nagreement with the results obtained in Coelho et al. (2013a). The former is not in agreement \nwith the results obtained for the environmental samples which show similar levels of Mo in \nsamples from both areas \u2013 exposed and control.\n\n\n\n144 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\nConfl ict of interest\n\nThe authors declare no confl icts of interests.\n\n Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology through grants SFRH/\nBD/47781/2008 and SFRH/BD/63343/2009, and project PTDC/SAU-ESA/102367/2008.

Conclusions\n\nThe mining and benefi ciation processes at Panasqueira mine generates huge quantities of \narsenic-rich mine wastes responsible for the high levels of metals at the Barroca Grande \nand Rio tailings. Tailings and open air impoundments are the main source of pollution in the \nsurrounding area due to the sulfi des oxidation that enhances the mobilization and migration of \ntrace metals from the mining wastes into the environment, namely waters, stream sediments, \nsoils, vegetables and street dusts. \n\nA fi rst environmental study performed under the scope of the e-Ecorisk project, allowed a \nfi rst characterization the Z\u00eazere river hidrogeochemistry. The upstream Z\u00eazere river water \nsamples (background) are classifi ed as Na-bicarbonate waters; the Casinhas stream and \nseepage waters are considered as Ca2++Mg2+/SO\n\n4\n2- type, and the downstream Z\u00eazere river \n\nwaters are classifi ed as mixed Mg2+ and Ca2+ bicarbonate/sulfate waters; being this last two \nassociations under the infl uence of the mining activities.\n\nThe rainy season water samples are divided into three main groups. The fi rst group gathers \nthe seepage and Z\u00eazere river waters (this last sample collected on the base of Rio tailing \nwith signifi cant seepage discharge as a consequence of the heavy rainfall), with low pH and \nhigh electrical conductivity; a second group comprises Casinhas stream and a water sample \nof the confl uence of Casinhas stream and Z\u00eazere river, with higher pH and lower electrical \nconductivity values than the fi rst group; a last group is defi ned with the Barroco stream \nsamples, with near neutral pH values and low electrical conductivity. These different types \nof water represent distinct hydrogeochemical processes. The sulfate ion show high positive \ncorrelations with most metal(loid)s and the positive correlation with Ca possibly, refl ects the \ninfl uence of gypsum and calcite dissolution plus sulfi de oxidation. \n\nIn the dry season the pH is slightly higher, while SO\n4\n2- and metals concentration are lower, \n\nwhen compared with rainy period results. These results are due to the fact that rainy season \nsamples were collected immediately after a rainstorm and consequently the dissolution of the \neasily soluble sulfate minerals. During the dry season, sulfate effl orescences characteristic \nof acidic environment precipitate as complex mixtures of Fe-Al hydrated sulfates such as \nmelanterite and minor amounts of rozenite and szomolnokite. The most contaminated waters \nare in or close to the mine tailings (Rio and Barroca Grande), where the metal dispersion \nand acidity generation is clearer. The pH and Eh relationship is crucial in As immobilization/\nstabilization on solid phases. At Barroca Grande, the waters neutralization with lime promotes \nmetal precipitation, with Fe oxyhydroxides and to clay adsorption, whit pH increases. When \npromoted by lime the pH increase and Eh values are located in the As mobilization zone, \nthe element mobility enhance signifi cantly near the Salgueira WTP. Barroco stream waters \nare used for irrigation. Arsenic concentrations in the rainy period are below the parametric \nwater values for human consumption, according to the Portuguese law, but in the dry season \nthe results presents higher As concentration, exceeding the permitted values defi ned in the \nPortuguese legislation. Nevertheless, As is present in its oxidized form (H\n\n2\nAsO\n\n4\n- and HAsO\n\n4\n2-) \n\nand hence with a lower degree of toxicity.\n\nThe computed saturation index disclosed that Fe-oxides, Fe/Al-hydroxides, aluminosilicates \nand Al-hydrosulfates are the main mineral groups in which waters tend to become more \nsupersaturated. These phases are very important since they show a high metal(loid)s adsorption \ncapacity. Aqueous concentrations may be attenuated by goethite, gibbsite and/or ferrihydrite \n\n\n\n148 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\nprecipitation in the oxidation zone through adsorption processes. Geochemical calculations \nsuggest that the waters are undersaturated with respect to gypsum and calcite being Ca2+ \nand SO\n\n4\n2- in solution. The source of SiO\n\n2\n, Ca2+ and metals/metalloids, could be attributed to \n\nthe silicate weathering, calcite dissolution and sulfi de-mineral oxidation. The seepage waters \nshow higher capacity for mineral dissolution than Casinhas and Barroco streams samples \nthat shows predisposition for mineral precipitation. The divalent (Cd2+ and Mn2+) and sulfate \nspecies (CdSO\n\n4\n0 and MnSO\n\n4\n0) are the dominant phases of Cd and Mn in these waters which \n\n(Barroco stream) are used for agriculture irrigation and for human consumption representing \na risk to humans with a signifi cant carcinogenic risk especially due to the As concentrations. \n\nAlthough the concentrations of the water samples were not extremely high, the stream \nsediments show high concentrations exceeding the toxicity limits. The mechanical and \nchemical dispersion, due to the dynamic of the stream and river surface waters, favors the \nmobilization and the incorporation of metals/metaloids in stream sediments. The irregular \ndecay of these anomalous patterns suggests the interference of local hydrological and a \ngeomorphologically rugged region which promote mechanisms of fast erosion, transport \nand accumulation of solid materials, most of which are transported in suspension by surface \nwaters. Elements like As, W and Fe showed high ratio values calculated between the amounts \nof metals in sediments and in waters. These three elements are the most expressive elements \nrelated to the ore deposit and their high amounts in sediments prove that they are being \nmobilized out from the tailings impoundments to the water courses. The near-neutral pH \nvalues of these waters favor the precipitation/adsorption of these metals in sediments.\n\nOnce oxidation of the tailing sulfi des may give rise to the mobilization and migration of trace \nmetals from the mining wastes into the soils, this sample media was selected and collected \nat two depths \u2013 superfi cial (topsoil) and 15 cm depth soil (subsurface), allowing distinguishing \ndifferent sources of contamination, i.e., anthropogenic contamination and natural or geogenic \ncontamination. The geochemical background was also determined with the collection of soil \nsamples in Casegas area. Topsoil was classifi ed globally has very acid to acid, being the areas \nwith the lowest pH soil values related with the highest SOM percentages. The topsoil PCA \nresults allowed the identifi cation of the Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, W and Zn association (potentially \ntoxic elements \u2013 PTEs), what puts in evidence the infl uence of the rich mine wastes, stored \nin Barroca Grande and Rio tailings and in the open air impoundments. The mechanical \ndispersion due to the wind of the hydrated metal sulfates stored in the Barroca Grande and \nRio open-air impoundments (that evaporate during warm periods) together with hydrological \nfactors, favoring the elements transport and its chemical dispersion contaminating the local \nsoils with As and sulfi de-related heavy metals (such as Cu and Cd). The precipitation of soluble \nsecondary minerals, temporally retain metals/metalloids in their lattice during warm and dry \nperiods, but such minerals are easily dissolved in rainy periods.\n\nVery strong correlations were found between the PTE\u2019s and between PTE\u2019s and pH, being \nstrongest in the Ag/Cu, As/Ag and Bi/W correlations. The PTE\u2019s and pH positive correlation, \nconfi rms that heavy metal mobility holds a positive association with pH, affecting their \navailability. The ANOVA analysis, displayed signifi cant variations with depth and the majority \nof the PTE\u2019s (Ag, As, Bi, Cd and W) and pH presents a signifi cant variation for Ag, W and \nZn. Selective chemical extraction demonstrate that the most pollutant fraction in these soil \nconsists of metals bounded to sulfi des, but also to amorphous or poorly crystalline iron oxide \ngeochemical phases. Nevertheless, As, Cd, Cu, and Zn are also linked to the exchangeable \n\n\n\n149Part III \u2013 Conclusions\n10. Conclusions\n\nand acid-soluble bearing-phases, upon which desorption and ion exchange reactions may \noriginate the release of these readily mobile phases. \n\nThe estimated pollution load index (PLI) established a local soil quality classifi cation trough \n100% of samples with a moderate to a high degree of contamination. The PLI spatial \ndistribution showed that soils are potential toxic elements (As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Bi) enriched, \nwhen compared with local background soils, exceeding, for example, for As 20x the Ontario \nreference value for agricultural soils (11 mg kg-1). \n\nAccording to the calculated contamination factor and the modifi ed degree of contamination \n(mC\n\nd\n), 92.6% of the soil samples registered moderate to ultra-high degree of pollution. The \n\nspatial distribution of the mC\nd\n reveal areas with a very high degree of contamination, being the \n\nhighest values identifi ed near Barroca Grande, S\u00e3o Francisco de Assis and Rio, confi rming \nthe mechanical and chemical dispersion from tailings. \n\nThe estimated potential ecological risk (PERI) classifi es both soil depths with a very high risk. \nIn the PERI spatial distribution, topsoil has a wide area classifi ed with a very high ecological \nrisk, consistent with wind direction, water courses and actual and previous exploration and \nbenefi ciation locations.\n\nThe non-carcinogenic hazard effects determined for children (1-6 years old) indicated that \nAg, Cd, Cu, W and Zn elements do not present a non-carcinogenic hazard in children, while \nfor As there is a high risk for non-cancer health effects in children in the villages under the \ninfl uence of the Panasqueira mining activities. The carcinogenic risk for both children and \nadult, revealed a very high cancer risk due to As ingestion which may cause several human \norgans cancer through ingestion, and lung and skin cancer through inhalation.\n\nConsidering the previous fi ndings is possible to conclude that local populations are probably \nexposed to some potential health risks through dusts inhalation and by waters, soils and \nvegetables ingestion. The metal assemblage identifi ed in the rhizosphere soils collected \nin S. Francisco de Assis village, downstream Barroca Grande tailings deposit, may refl ect \nthe infl uence of the tailings and open air impoundments materials, associated with several \ndispersion agents, including wind, leading to deposition in soils, vegetables and superfi cial \nwaters. These soils exceed, for example, for As 20x the Ontario reference value for agricultural \nsoils (11 mg kg-1) and the estimated values for enrichment index (EI) are high, ranging (1.0 \n&lt;EI &lt;12.2) mainly due to the presence of As, Cu and also Cd and Pb. The high levels of \nAs in these soils seems to be linked to sulfi des, refl ecting the presence of arsenopyrite in \nsoils. The comparison to the Ontario guidelines indicates that these soils are considered as \n\u2018\u2018grossly polluted\u2019\u2019. Also the street dusts collected exceed the reference acceptable risk and \nthe maximum acceptable values for As, Cd, Cu and Zn. These contents results from a wind \ndispersion mechanism, with great expression in this area. If particles are at an inhaled size, \ne.g. PM\n\n10\n and PM\n\n2.5\n, might be very worrying. Regarding the sampled irrigation waters, some \n\nhave slightly acidic character and others have circumneutral pH, with very low mineralization \n(electric conductivity range from 18 to 161 ?S cm-1) and low SO\n\n4\n2- and Cl- concentrations, \n\nhowever major ions contents tend to increase with the decrease of pH. Metal and metalloid \nconcentrations are also low and, according the Portuguese law, legally acceptable. \n\nThe S. Francisco de Assis vegetables were also contaminated. In one way, for potatoes there \nis a preferential accumulation in the roots and leaves while for the cabbage most elements \nhave a preferential accumulation in the roots. Nevertheless As, Cd and Pb concentrations \n\n\n\n150 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\nare above the maximum permitted level for vegetables proposed by FAO/WHO (www.\ncodexalimentarius.org), which could be a potential health concern to local residents. The risk \nindex for residents determined, due to the ingestion of the metals and metalloids, reveal that \nCd, As and Pb represents an hazard for the inhabitants of S. Francisco de Assis village, once \nthey are probably exposed to some potential health risks through the intake of As, Cd and \nalso Pb trough the ingesting these metals, by consuming vegetables grown in their yards.\n\nThe multidisciplinary approach (environmental and biological) conducted in the environmentally \nexposed villages (S. Francisco de Assis and Barroca) and in control areas (Unhais-o-Velho \nand Casegas) established unequivocally the link between environmental contamination by \nseveral metal(loid)s and the signifi cant increase in concentrations found for internal dose \nbiomarkers from exposed populations when compared to controls. Results of local soils, \nwaters and street dusts samples shows that these different media contain high concentrations \nof As, Cd, Cu, Pb and/or Zn when compared with local geochemical background values. \nResults obtained in biomarkers of exposure agree with the environmental studies results, \npointing to populations living nearby the mine being exposed to metal(loid)s promoted by the \nmining activities. Arsenic was the element with the highest increase in exposed populations. \nConcentration values also indicate populations being recently exposed to As, organic and \ninorganic forms. Results obtained in the other matrices allowed recognizing that the exposure \nis continuous. The concentration of other elements such as Cd, Cr, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb and Zn \nalso increased, although at a lesser extent.\n\nThis research highlights the need for competent authorities to get involved in the areas \nidentifi ed as highly polluted. Priority should be given to areas where samples are classifi ed \nas requiring reclamation, when they are geographically located in agricultural or urban areas. \nAppropriate environmental laws with adequate monitoring enforcement need to be adopted \nto prevent most of the damage caused in mine surrounding communities. All these measures \nwill help to a better protection of the health and safety of workers and inhabitants near and \nthose otherwise impacted by historic, current and proposed mines.\n\n10.1.

Characterization of some potencially toxic elements\n\nThis thesis subsection intends to be a small review of the PTE (Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, W and Zn) \nidentifi ed in the superfi cial soil samples of the Panasqueira mine.\n\nArsenic\n\nArsenic (As; CAS 7440-38-2) is a ubiquitous metalloid occurring naturally in over 245 different \nmineral forms of which approximately 60% are arsenates, 20% sulfi des and sulfosalts and \nthe remaining 20% includes arsenides, arsenites, oxides, silicates and elemental arsenic, \nbeing arsenopyrite the most common As mineral (USEPA, 2000; WHO, 2001a; Sharma and \nSohn, 2009). This element is classifi ed as a group 1 (carcinogenic to humans; IARC http://\nmonographs.iarc.fr/, 2013).\n\nAlthough the ultimate source of arsenic is geological, human activities such as mining, burning \nof fossil fuels, and pesticide applications contaminate both soils and groundwater\u2019s, especially \nunder anoxic conditions (Nriagu and Azcue, 1990; Bissen and Frimmel, 2003).  Arsenic is \nwidely distributed in the environment, mainly in soil and water, and also in some foods such \nas rice, vegetables, fi sh, shellfi sh, and milk (Beni et al. 2008; \u00d6tles and \u00c7agindi, 2010).\n\nIn the environment and in the diet, As can be found in both organic and inorganic forms \n(\u00d6tles and \u00c7agindi, 2010). Methylation of inorganic As is the major metabolism pathway. In \nhumans, arsenate (As(V)) is fi rst reduced to arsenite (As(III)), which is itself methylated into \nmethylarsonic and dimethylarsinic acids (MMA and DMA), most of which is then excreted \nvia the renal pathway (\u00d6tles and \u00c7agindi, 2010). Excretion via feces, nails, and hair is minor \n(ATSDR, 2007). Public health organizations consider inorganic As(III), and to a lesser extent \nAs(V), to be the most dangerous forms, and the methylated forms to be less harmful (\u00d6tles \nand \u00c7agindi, 2010).\n\nThe acute toxicity of arsenic is related to its chemical form and oxidation state (Hughes, 2002). \nTable 12.1 presents the median lethal dose (LD\n\n50\n) of several arsenicals in laboratorial animals.\n\nTable 12.1.

In adult humans the lethal range of inorganic arsenic is estimated at of 1\u20133 \nmg kg-1 (Ellenhorn, 1997). Recently, median lethal concentration (LC\n\n50\n) values were estimated \n\n\n\n170 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\nas 571, 843, 5.49, and 2.16 ?M for As(V), DMAV, As(III), and DMAIII, respectively, for human cells \n(Naranmandura et al., 2007). This study also showed that dimethylmonothioarsenic (DMMTAV) \nis much more toxic than other pentavelent nonthiolated arsenicals (Naranmandura et al., \n2007). The characteristics of severe acute arsenic toxicity in humans include gastrointestinal \ndiscomfort, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody urine, anuria, shock, convulsions, coma, and death \n(Hughes, 2002).\n\nThe earliest reports of As impacts on human health date back to the latter part of the 19th \ncentury (1887) in Hutchinson\u2019s, when the onset of skin effects (including pigmentation changes, \nhyperkerotosis and skin cancers) were linked to the consumption of arsenic in medicines and \ndrinking water (WHO, 2001a). Also individuals exposed to arsenic through medical treatment \nwith Fowler\u2019s solution (potassium arsenite), via inhalation at copper smelters (occupational \nexposure) and/or naturally contaminated drinking water developed cancer (Fierz, 1965; \nLee-Feldstein, 1983,1986; Cebrian et al., 1983; Hughes, 2002). \n\nIn general, there are four recognized stages of arsenicosis (Romero-Schmidt et al. 2001; \n\u00d6tles and \u00c7agindi, 2010): (a) Preclinical The patient shows no symptoms, but arsenic can \nbe detected in urine or body tissue samples; (b) Clinical various effects can be observed \nin the skin, being melanosis the most common symptom often observed on the palms, but \nalso iskeratosis, a more serious symptom with the hardening of skin into nodules, often on \npalms and soles; (c) Complications clinical symptoms become more pronounced and internal \norgans are affected, such as enlargement of the liver, kidneys, and spleen have been reported; \nand (d) Malignancy Tumors or cancers (carcinoma) affecting skin or other organs, like lung \nor bladder. Tumors due to As inhalation are registered primarily in lungs, whereas by oral \nexposure are initially observed in the skin (Lee-Feldstein, 1983,1986; Cebrian et al., 1983). \nAfter As entering the body it is distributed through several organs, including the lungs, liver, \nkidney, and skin (\u00d6tles and \u00c7agindi, 2010).

Some cosmetics and medications also have bismuth \nin different forms. Recent studies recognize this element as toxic (not a carcinogen). \nOverexposure to bismuth can lead to the formation of a black deposit on the gingiva, known \nas a bismuth line.\n\nBismuth can be inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. The most common exposure \nto bismuth is occupational. The consumption of medications and/or cosmetics is also an \n\n\n\n17112. Appendixes\n\nexposure route. Some studies suggests bismuth as substitute in lead ammunition, but a \nbioavailability study of bismuth showed that, like lead, bismuth can be measured in the urine \nand blood of animals (Urgast et al., 2012).\n\nExposure to Bi might induces nausea, headache, diarrhea, and pain. According to Braun et \nal. (2009), anemia might be promoted by exposure to Bi. This element as also been studied \nas a sperm metabolism redutor (Ghaffari et al., 2011), being Bi nanoparticles considered more \ntoxic than the other bismuth compounds (Luo et al., 2012b).    \n\nCadmium\n\nCadmium (Cd; CAS 7440-43-9) is a toxic transition metal, widely spread in the biosphere \nin spite of restrictions for its use (Hellstr\u00f6m et al., 2007). Cadmium was fi rst discovered in \n1817, as an impurity in zinc carbonate and has been recognized as an occupational health \nhazard for many decades (J\u00e4rup and \u00c5kesson, 2009). This element is classifi ed as a group 1 \n(carcinogenic to humans; IARC http://monographs.iarc.fr/, 2013).\n\nThe risks of environmentally exposed populations to Cd were emphasized with the discovery \nof the infamous Itai-itai disease (softening of the bones and kidney failure) induced by intake \nof cadmium-polluted rice (Hagino and Kono, 1955). Agricultural uses of phosphate fertilizers \nand sewage sludge and industrial uses of cadmium have been identifi ed as a major cause of \nwidespread dispersion of the metal at trace levels into the general environment and human \nfood. Other causes of cadmium dispersion are enhanced natural emission and bioaccumulation \ntaking place in certain plants, mammals and fi lter feeder organisms including crustaceans \nand mollusks (Satarug et al., 2003). During the last decade an increasing number of studies \nhave found adverse health effects at much lower levels than in the earlier studies (J\u00e4rup and \n\u00c5kesson, 2009; ATSDR, 1999a).\n\nFood is the most important source of Cd exposure in the general non-smoking population \n(WHO, 1992, 2001).Cadmium is present in virtually all food, but the concentrations vary \nto a great extent, depending on the type of food and the Cd load in the food production \nenvironment (Olsson et al., 2002). Natural occurrence of Cd in bedrock and soils as well \nas anthropogenic sources of Cd, such as industrial emissions and the application of soil \namendments (e.g. lime, phosphorous-fertilisers and sewage sludge) to farm land, may lead to \ncontamination of soil by Cd and increased uptake by cereal crops, vegetables and root crops \n(McLaughlin and Singh, 1999). Cadmium in soils is known to be more mobile and readily \nabsorbed and incorporated into plant tissues compared with lead and mercury (Singh and \nMcLaughlin, 1999). The uptake of soil Cd by plants is enhanced by a low pH (WHO, 1992; \nErikson et al., 1996; Grant et al., 1999). In particular, the Cd concentration in potatoes and \ncarrots has been shown susceptible to changes in soil pH during Swedish fi eld conditions \n(\u00d6born et al., 1995), while salinity, i.e. Cl concentration, is the major factor infl uencing potato \ntuber Cd concentration in other climatic regions (McLaughlin et al., 1997). Thus, a decrease \nof soil pH due to environmental acidifi cation, which is a well-recognized problem in Sweden, \nmay further increase the Cd concentration in food stuff (Hellstr\u00f6m et al., 2007). While Cd \nlevels in potatoes and carrots vary, clearly the contribution to the total dietary Cd intake in \nSweden is substantial (Graw\u00e9 et al., 2000). Plants are known to tolerate cadmium well and as \na result cadmium toxicity in plants occurs at higher concentrations than those causing toxicity \nin human and animals. Indeed, adverse effects of cadmium entering the food chain of some \n\n\n\n172 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach\nCarla Candeias | 2013\n\nwild animals have recently been reported. Classic symptoms of cadmium toxicity in bone \nwere found in female white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucurus) that feed heavily on willows \n(Sallix glauca; Satarug et al., 2003). The willow has a greater ability to concentrate cadmium \nfrom soils compared with other plant species of the same areas (Larison et al., 2000). High \nlevels of cadmium were found in liver and kidney samples of moose (Alces alces); another \nanimal species known to normally eat large quantities of willows (Kim et al., 2000). In early \nstudies, seabirds, starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), Japanese quails (Coturnex coturnex) were also \nfound to be susceptible to cadmium that entered into their food chain (Gochfeld, 1997).\n\nThe upper respiratory tract and lungs are most exposed to cadmium dusts and vapors of \npolluted atmospheres. Acute ingestion targets intestine, liver and kidneys: the latter accumulate \ncadmium and thereby experience serious tubular injury (Martelli et al., 2006). Once absorbed, \ncadmium has a very long half-life, estimated at more than 20 years in humans (Satarug et al., \n2003). This exceptional residence time in the body refl ects that cadmium can be effi ciently \ntrapped in the body and that it escapes through detoxifi cation (Martelli et al., 2006).\n\nThe human clinical symptoms observed upon cadmium exposure are tightly associated \nwith the organ distribution of the metal. Inhalation causes respiratory stress and injures the \nrespiratory tract. Emphysema, anosmia and chronic rhinitis have been linked to high cadmium \nconcentrations in polluted air. Cadmium has been classifi ed as a human pulmonary carcinogen \nbecause of the large incidence of lung cancers in occupationally exposed populations \n(Martelli et al., 2006). Cadmium may cause or participate to the onset or propagation of other \nkinds of cancers, but the scarcity of data has not extended the range of human cadmium \ncarcinogenicity beyond lung carcinoma (Waalkes, 2003).\n\nAnemia and eosinophilia have been associated with cadmium intoxication, and accumulation \nin kidneys leads to nephropathy and proteinurea (J\u00e4rup and \u00c5kesson, 2009). Osteomalacia \nand osteoporosis may result from cadmium interference with the formation and maintenance \nof bones. A clear link between water and food pollution by cadmium with recapitulation of \nsome of the above symptoms (osteomalacia, bone fractures, proteinurea, pain\u2026) has been \nestablished for the Itai\u2013Itai disease observed in a mining region of Japan (Martelli et al., 2006).\n\nCopper\n\nCopper (Cu; CAS 7440-50-8) is classifi ed as a group 3 (not classifi able as carcinogenic to \nhumans; IARC http://monographs.iarc.fr/, 2013). Cu chemical and physical properties (e.g. \nhigh thermal conductivity, high electrical conductivity, malleability, low corrosion) have made \nit one of the most important metals. Copper have four oxidation states: Cu(O), Cu(I), Cu(II), \nand Cu(III).\n\nIn humans, copper is a respiratory irritant. Workers exposed to copper dust report a number \nof symptoms that are suggestive of respiratory irritation, including coughing, sneezing, \nthoracic pain, and runny nose (ATSDR, 2005a). According to Suciu et al. (1981) grinding \nand sieving copper dust workers, anorexia, nausea, and occasional diarrhea were reported. \nExposure levels ranged from 111 to 434 mg Cu m3 over a 3-year period. It is likely that the \nobserved gastrointestinal effects were due to oral exposure to copper. Ingestion probably \nresulted from mucocilliary clearance of copper particles deposited in the nasopharyngeal and \ntracheobronchial regions of the respiratory tract (ATSDR, 2005a).\n\nThere are numerous reports of acute gastrointestinal effects in humans after ingestion of large \namounts of copper in drinking water or beverages. The most prevalent effects are nausea and \n\n\n\n17312. Appendixes\n\nvomiting, which typically occur shortly after ingestion and are not persistent. Abdominal pain \nand diarrhea have also been reported, but their incidence is typically much lower than nausea \nand vomiting (ATSDR, 2005a).\n\nSilver\n\nSilver (Ag; CAS 7440-22-4) occurs naturally in several oxidation states. The most common \nare elemental silver (0 oxidation state) and the monovalent silver ion (+1 oxidation state). \nMost of the Ag toxicological studies have investigated these chemical forms of the element. \nOther possible oxidation states of silver are +2 and +3, however, no toxicological studies were \nlocated that researched the health effects of silver compounds with these oxidation states. \nMost occupational exposures to silver occur through inhalation of silver-containing dusts or \ndermal exposure to photographic compounds (ATSDR, 1999b).\n\nTungsten\n\nTungsten (W,  CAS 14040-11-0) is a naturally occurring element found in the earth surface \nrocks, and typically not occur as the free element in nature. Of the more than 20 tungsten-\nbearing minerals, some of the commonly used commercial ones include feberite (iron \ntungstate), huebnerite (manganese tungstate), wolframite (iron-manganese tungstate), and \nscheelite (calcium tungstate). Tungsten forms a variety of different compounds, such as \ntungsten trioxide, tungsten carbide, and ammonium paratungstate (ATSDR, 2005b).\n\nPulmonary fi brosis, memory and sensory defi cits, and increased mortality due to lung cancer \nhave been attributed to occupational exposure to dusts generated during the manufacture or \nuse of high tensile strength tungsten (hard metal). Acute oral exposure to tungsten does not \nappear to be a particular toxicity concern, based on acute oral LD\n\n50\n values ranging from 240 \n\nto 11,300 mg kg-1 day for several soluble tungsten compounds (ATSDR, 2005b).\n\nZinc\n\nZinc (Zn, CAS 7440-66-6) is ubiquitous in the environment and occurs in the earth\u2019s crust \nat an average concentration of about 70 mg kg-1 (Thomas, 1991). Zinc metal is not found \nfreely in nature; rather it occurs in the +2 oxidation state primarily as various minerals such as \nsphalerite (zinc sulfi de), smithsonite (zinc carbonate), and zincite (zinc oxide). Fifty-fi ve zinc \ncontaining minerals are known to exist (USEPA, 2005). The primary anthropogenic sources of \nzinc in the environment are from metal smelters and mining activities (ATSDR, 2005c).\n\nHuman studies have investigated the effects of dietary zinc supplementation. High doses \ncan cause clinical symptoms of gastrointestinal distress, while low doses primarily affect the \nstatus of other essential nutrients such as copper and iron (USEPA, 2005; WHO, 2001b).\n\nNo adequate experimental evidence has been found to indicate that zinc salts administered \norally or parenterally are tumorigenic. Defi ciency and supplements of zinc can have an \ninfl uence on carcinogenesis, possibly as a result of the infl uence of zinc on cell growth (Rath \net al., 1991). Zinc has been demonstrated to inhibit the mutagenic action of some genotoxic \ncarcinogens (Leonard and Gerber, 1989) but has also been shown to be co-carcinogenic in \nother studies (Wallenius et al., 1979; USEPA, 2005).\n\n\n\n\n\n17512.

Large masses of sulfide minerals are exposed\nduring the mining and milling processes. The generation and dis-\ncharge of AMD with low pH and containing high concentrations\nof dissolved metals may seriously disturb the water quality. The\nkey to understand mining effects depends directly on understand-\ning the processes that produce AMD. Acidic drainage is caused by\nthe oxidation of sulfide minerals exposed to atmospheric oxygen.\nAlthough acid drainage is commonly associated with the extrac-\ntion and processing of sulfide-bearing metalliferous ore deposits\nand sulfide-rich coal, AMD can occur wherever sulfide minerals\nare exposed to atmospheric oxygen (Blowes et al., 2003). The oxi-\ndation of pyrite is a complex hydrobiogeochemical process that ad-\nversely affects the water quality of receiving streams by producing\nacid waters with high metal concentrations. Sulfide ore extraction\nand processing enhances the rate of pyrite oxidation, increases the\nrate of acid production, and can cause severe environmental\ndamage (Plumlee and Logsdon, 1999; Jambor et al., 2003;\nNordstrom et al., 2007).\n\nThe Panasqueira mine was chosen to be studied due to several\nfactors: (a) it is an active mine; (b) the existence of huge volumes\nof tailing piles and mud dams, (c) small villages near the mine site;\n(d) the Z\u00eazere river crosses the area, which supply the Castelo de\nBode dam (located 90 km downstream), the main water provider\nfor Lisbon; and (e) the local population strongly depends on the\nuse of land and water for their subsistence. The effect of Panasque-\nira mining activities and the metals release from acid mine waters\nto water courses is dynamic and actual (e-EcoRisk, 2007; \u00c1vila\net al., 2008; Ferreira da Silva et al., 2013; Candeias et al., 2013;\nCoelho et al., 2013). Regarding the study presented by \u00c1vila et al.\n(2008) and its conclusions, mainly related to the dynamics of\nleaching, transport, and accumulation of some selected metals\nand metalloids in different media (stream sediments, alluvium,\nsurface waters, impoundment materials, iron coatings, arsenopy-\nrite stockpile material, and ferruginous crust) this study aims to\ncharacterize the heavy metal contamination at Z\u00eazere river taking\ninto consideration the physico-chemical properties of the waters\nsampled on the Z\u00eazere river and along the mine drainage. The main\ngoal of this geochemical research is (a) to characterize the surface\nwater chemical changes that occur along the flow path of Z\u00eazere\nugal).

Site description\n\nThe Panasqueira hydrothermal mineralization is the biggest Sn\u2013\nW deposit of Western Europe and has been in operation since 1896\nto the present date (Smith, 2006; Ferreira da Silva et al., 2013). The\nmining concession is located geographically in Central Portugal\n(Fig. 1), between Gardunha and S. Pedro de A\u00e7or mountains, at\napproximately 20 km SW of Serra da Estrela, the highest mountain\nof mainland Portugal (1993 m). The local topography ranges in alti-\ntude from 350 to 1080 m (Reis, 1971), with deep valleys. Climate,\nwhich can be an important instability factor, is aggressive with\nhot and dry conditions during the summer and very cold, rainy,\nand windy conditions in the winter (\u00c1vila et al., 2008). The mean\nannual temperature is 12 ?C, ranging from 0 ?C during the winter\nto 30 ?C in the summer (source www.inag.pt). The streams, with\nthe exception of Z\u00eazere river, are generally dry in the summer\nand flooded in the winter. The small villages around the mine have\na historical dependence on soil and water use \u2013 drinking water,\nagriculture, cattle breeding, fishing and sylviculture.\n\n2.1. Geology and mineralization\n\nAccording to the paleogeographic and tectonic zoning estab-\nlished by Lotze (1945) and Julivert et al. (1974), this deposit is in-\ncluded in the Central Iberian Zone (CIZ), where the Sn\u2013W deposits,\nsuch as Panasqueira, are spatially related to the contacts between\nthe sintectonic muscovite\u2013biotite and the metasedimentary coun-\ntry rocks. A detailed description of the local geology was presented\nin \u00c1vila et al. (2008). The Panasqueira deposit contains mainly,\nwolframite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite and cassiterite. The\nPanasqueira deposit consists on a sequence known as the upper\nFig. 1. Location of the Panasqueira mine a\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Candeias, C., et al.

No granite crops out\nin the district, but a granite cupola strongly greisenized with\nincreasingly alteration was penetrated at shallow depths in the\nmine (Kelly and Rye, 1979). Thermal metamorphism spatially asso-\nciated with the Hercynian batholith produced a regionally exten-\nsive aureole of spotted shales in the schist\u2013graywacke complex.\nThe paragenesis is complex and 4 stages of mineral formation are\naccepted by most of the authors who have studied this deposit:\n1st stage, the oxide silicate phase (quartz, wolframite; cassiterite);\n2nd phase, the main sulfide phase (pyrite, arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite,\nsphalerite, chalcopyrite); 3rd stage, the pyrrhotite alteration phase\n(marcasite, siderite, galena, Pb\u2013Bi\u2013Ag sulfosalts); and 4th stage,\nthe late carbonate phase (dolomite, calcite) (Noronha et al.,\n1992; Correa and Naique, 1998; Corr\u00eaa de S\u00e1 et al., 1999; Breiter,\n2001). At Panasqueira, more than 65 minerals including sulfides,\nsulfosalts, oxides, carbonates, silicates, phosphates, and tungstate\nminerals, have been identified (Kelly and Rye, 1979).\n2.2. Mining activity\n\nThe Panasqueira mining concession has been in production for\nover 100 years and is one of the largest economic vein deposits\nin the world. The first prospecting license was granted in 1895\nand the first reference to wolframite mineralization in Panasqueira\nmine reportedly dated to 1896. The mine produce wolframite and\ncassiterite concentrates, with secondary production of copper\nconcentrates. Arsenopyrite (the main sulfide) is discarded to the\ntailings which contain about 30% of As. During the period\n1947\u20132001, the mine produced about 96,456 t of WO3, 4901 t of\nSnO2 and 28,924 t of Cu from more than 27 Mt of rock (Cavey\nand Gunning, 2006). The long history of mining and milling\nactivities are stated by the presence of huge tailings and mud\nnd the surface waters sampling sites.\n\nhe Panasqueira mine and its influence on Z\u00eazere river (Central Portugal).

Nowadays offices, underground exploration, milling pro-\ncesses, tailing (?7,000,000 m3) and mud dams (?1,193,885 m3 \u2013\none active and one deactivated) are located in Barroca Grande. Un-\ntil 1996 the underground operations took place in Barroca Grande\nand the ore were transported by an aerial rope tramway trough\n5.1 km to the concentration plant located in Rio. The milling facil-\nities at Rio, located near Z\u00eazere river (Fig. 1), had the advantage of\nlocal ore deposits and water from the river for milling operations\n(Crosby, 2001). The Rio site consists in a large area of tailings, a\nseepage collection and treatment system. With a long history of\nmining and milling at Rio, a significant volume of tailings materials\nwas generated (?1,200,000 m3) with an elevation of approxi-\nmately 350 m, slopes of about 35? and three main types of materi-\nals: coarse grained waste rock composed primarily of schist and\nquartz; fine grained mill tailings originating from mill operations\ncomposed by sand, mud, and slush and an pile with arsenopyrite\n(9400 m3) separated during mill flotation processing, that re-\nmained exposed until June 2006 when was capped with geotextile\nand layers of clay (Gilchrist and Mahmoud, 1999; Crosby, 2001; e-\nEcoRisk, 2007). The muds and slush were discharged into a pond\nthat was intentionally created for that purpose. The pond is an\nopen air impoundment and contains 731,034 m3 of rejected ore\nconcentrates with high metal levels (\u00c1vila et al., 2008). The piles\nand open air impoundments are exposed to the atmospheric con-\nditions for a long time, which affect their chemical, mineralogical,\nphysical and geotechnical elements. Infiltration of rain water oc-\ncurs across the tailing area, this water carries the acid products\nof sulfides oxidation. To prevent acid drainage, two water treat-\nment plants exist in Panasqueira mine, one in Barroca Grande\nand other in Rio, where the acid waters formed are collected,\npumped and treated. Acid effluents are neutralized with lime\nTable 1\nPhysicochemical data of seepage waters, surface waters from Casinhas stream and Z\u00eazere\n\nVar Units Seepage waters\n\nSP1 SP2 SP3 BG\n\npH \u2013 3.0 2.9 3.2 3.9\nSC mS cm?1 3.63 4.40 2.02 1.26\nSiO2 mg L\n\n?1 103 108 99 30\nCl mg L?1 5 6 4 5\nSO4 mg L\n\n?1 2990 3720 1400 727\nF mg L?1 nd nd nd nd\nHCO3 mg L\n\n?1 nd nd nd nd\nPO4 lg L\n\n?1 nd nd nd nd\nNO3 mg L\n\n?1 nd nd nd nd\nNO2 lg L\n\n?1 nd nd nd nd\nNa mg L?1 17.8 19.3 11.8 12.7\nK mg L?1 6 0.1 1 2\nMg mg L?1 274 357 103 95\nCa mg L?1 287 401 175 107\nAl lg L?1 149,000 161,000 99,000 6100\nAs lg L?1 2140 544 146 48\nCd lg L?1 464 393 226 88\nCu lg L?1 42,700 54,300 20,100 2100\nFe lg L?1 82,500 91,000 9400 1700\nMn lg L?1 88,700 92,600 22,300 10,200\nZn lg L?1 49,200 44,500 21,900 12,400\nLi lg L?1 1170 1010 751 192\nBe lg L?1 57 61 38&lt;10\nCo lg L?1 2620 3330 1140 125\nNi lg L?1 2150 2830 1140 397\nSr lg L?1 658 507 380 396\nPb lg L?1&lt;22&lt;22&lt;22&lt;22\nY lg L?1 428 542 322 33\nTDS mg L?1 2360 2860 1313 819\n\na These three values are lower than the quantification limit of the ICP-MS method but\nwaters collected in Rio tailing; sample BG \u2013 mine entrance in Barroca Grande; samples CS\nand Bk2 \u2013 Z\u00eazere river upstream Rio tailing; samples CF and ZZ \u2013 Z\u00eazere river; nd \u2013 no\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Candeias, C., et al.

After this treatment clean water is conducted\nto the ore dressing plant, or discharged directly in the Z\u00eazere river,\nwhile precipitates are disposed via pipeline in the mud dam (Gil-\nchrist and Mahmoud, 1999). On the bottom of Rio tailing a channel\nsystem has been installed to collect the seepage, of acid mine\ndrainage water (AMD), nevertheless during the winter and periods\nof heavy rainfall the system easily overload resulting in mixing of\nAMD directly with the Z\u00eazere river.\n\n3.

The analyzed elements include major anions (HCO?3 , Cl\n\n?,\nNO?3 , and SO\n\n2?\n4 ), major cations (Na, K, Mg\n\n2+ and Ca2+), as well a\nsuite of dissolved trace metals (Ag, Al, As, Bi, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Hg,\nMo, Ni, Pb, S, Sb, and Zn). Unacidified samples were analyzed using\na Dionex 1000i ion chromatography (IC) Work33 station to deter-\nmine the Cl?, NO?3 , and SO\n\n2?\n4 concentrations. Anisocratic elution\n\nwith a sodium bicarbonate\u2013sodium carbonate eluent was em-\nployed together with a Dionex AS4-SC column. The alkalinity was\ndetermined in situ by volumetric titration on filtered unacidified\nsamples using H2SO4 acid 0.16 N.\n\nAlthough standards were prepared containing only the above\nanions, other anions would have been detected if present at levels\ngreater than ?0.1 mg L?1. For concentrated samples, dilution was\nrequired for reliable anion analysis. The concentrations of major\ncations and trace elements in acidified waters were determined\nusing mass inductive plasma spectrometry (ICP-MS) at the LNEG\naccredited lab. Reagent blanks and duplicate samples were in-\nserted into each batch for quality control (Ramsey et al., 1987).\nThe geostandards AQUACHECK and EAA 4 were used to check the\nvalidity and reproducibility of the results. Typical uncertainties,\nincluding all error sources, are ?6% for the trace elements, and be-\ntween 2% and 7% for the major anions, depending on the concen-\ntration levels. The limit of detection for the analyzed trace metals\nranges between 0.05 and 10 mg L?1.\n3.3.

Water geochemistry\n\nThe results presented in Table 1, show that water samples can be\ndivided distinctly into three main groups based on its location and\nalso in the pH and electric conductivity (SC) conditions: the\nCasinhas stream samples with 4.3 &lt;pH &lt;5.7 and 0.35 &lt;SC\n&lt;1.09 mS cm?1; the Z\u00eazere river waters with 6.8 &lt;pH &lt;7.1 and\n0.037 &lt;SC &lt;0.076 mS cm?1 and the seepage water with a\n2.9 &lt;pH &lt;3.9 and 1.26 &lt;SC &lt;4.40 mS cm?1. These different types\nof water represent distinct hydrogeochemical processes. The trace\nmetal concentrations in the seepage water and water collected in\nthe Casinhas stream are higher than the concentration in the Z\u00eazere\nwater. Sulfate concentrations cover a range from 4 to 3717 mg L?1\n\nand the highest concentrations are associated with waste piles\nand correlate with low pH values (r = ?0.98, p &lt;0.05).

The\n\noxidation of sulfide minerals in mine-waste rock piles and tailings\nimpoundments generates acidic waters containing high concentra-\ntions of SO2?4 , Fe (II), and other metals. According to Blowes et al.\n(2003) a sequence of geochemical reactions occurring in the mine\nwastes and in underlying aquifers results in profound changes in\nthe concentrations of dissolved constituents and in the mineralogy\nand physical properties of the mine waste and aquifer materials.\nThe Casinhas stream and seepage waters show low pH and are en-\nriched in sulfate ions but also in some of the major and trace\nelements.\n\nLow-pH conditions promote the dissolution of many metal-\nbearing solids and the metals desorption from solid surfaces. The\nprobable source of sulfate and heavy metals are the oxidation of\nsulfide minerals, mainly arsenopyrite, but also pyrite and chalco-\npyrite. These acidic waters are displaced into underlying or adja-\ncent geological materials, or it is discharged directly to the\nadjacent surface water flow system. The geochemical reactions of\nthese waters with the gangue minerals result in progressive in-\ncreases in pH through acid neutralization reactions and the atten-\nuation of the concentrations of dissolved metals released from\nmine wastes.\n\nAccording to the Ficklin diagram (Fig. 3a) the Panasqueira\nwaters can be separated in four groups: (1) high-acid and extreme\nmetal content; (2) acid and high-metal content; (3) near neutral\nand high metal content; and (4) near neutral pH and low metal\ncontent. The first three groups represent the seepage and the Casi-\nnhas stream waters, and the fourth group includes the Z\u00eazere river\nsamples, collected upstream and downstream the Rio tailing.\nAccording to Plumlee et al. (1999) the group classified as high acid\nand extreme metal rich are typical of drainage water derived from\npolymetallic deposits characterized by low buffering potential. The\nmost polluted waters are in or close to the mine tailing, where the\nmetal dispersion and acidity generation is clearer. Two of the Casi-\nnhas stream samples also show a high metal content but with a pH\nvalues near neutral. On the other hand the waters collected in Z\u00eaz-\nere river present a near neutral pH and low contents of metals,\nmore evident on the upstream samples. This high metal contents\nand low pH reflect the influence of the acidic waters from the tail-\nings and mud impoundments, while the low concentration values\nand neutral pH reflects the dilution phenomena and the geochem-\nical baselines values of local surface waters. The plots of SO4, As, Al,\nFe and Mn concentrations versus pH values (Fig. 3b\u2013f) show the\nsame trend of increasing metal content with decreasing pH and re-\nflects the greater amounts of sulfide minerals and a smaller con-\ntent of carbonates and other minerals that consume acid\naccording to Plumlee et al. (1999).\n\n4.2. Water rock interaction\n\nChemical elements speciation was performed using the PHRE-\nEQC code in conjunction with the WATEQ4F data base.

Regarding\nZ\u00eazere river waters, according to the calculated SI, they are over-\nsaturated in some of the silicate minerals and clay minerals and\nundersaturated in sulfates.\n\nThe seepage waters (SP1, SP2, SP3 and BG) are mainly saturated\nor near equilibrium with respect to alunite KAl3(SO4)2(OH)6 while\nthe majority samples of the Casinhas stream and the Z\u00eazere river\nare oversaturated in gibbsite Al(OH)3. It is thought that an increase\nin sulfate activity may promote the formation of sulfate minerals\n(e.g. gypsum, anhydrite and alunite) when the aqueous solution\nare rich in cations such as Ca, Al and K. The association of alteration\nminerals alunite + quartz is formed at pH lower than 3.5, while the\nkaolinite + alunite assemblage develops at pH 4.9 (Perry et al.,\n1980 and Wirsching et al., 1990). The relationships between alu-\nnite and kaolinite were determined by Wirsching et al. (1990) on\nthe basis of experimental studies.\n\n3Al2Si2 O5\u00f0OH\u00de4 \u00fe 6H\n\u00fe \u00fe 2K\u00fe \u00fe 4SO2?4 \u00fe 9H2O\n\nKaolinite\n\n! 2KAl3\u00f0OH\u00de6\u00f0SO4\u00de2 \u00fe 6H4SiO4\nAlunite\n\nThe alunite is a reaction product of kaolinite with sulfuric acid.\nAccording to Inoue (1995), the very low pH values observed in\nseepage waters, are related to the sulfides oxidation.\n\nThe mineralogical composition of samples collected in Rio site\n(in the dam and in the tailing), reveals the presence of arsenopy-\nrite, scorodite, marcasite, pyrite, mica, quartz, illite, vermiculite,\nnatrojarosite, kaolinite, chlorite, illite, montmorillonite and mont-\nmorillonite\u2013vermiculite. The mineralogical composition of Z\u00eazere\nriver stream sediments revealed the presence of mica, quartz, chlo-\nrite, kaolinite, feldspar and hematite (XRD identification). At the base\nof the Rio tailings dam, scorodite (FeAsO4?2H2O), melanterite\n(Fe2+(SO4)?7(H2O)) and minor amounts of rozenite (Fe2+(SO4)?4(H2O))\nand szomolnokite (Fe2+(SO4)?(H2O)) were observed and identified\nby XRD. Acid mine drainage discharged from the Rio tailing (SP1)\nhas a pH of 3.0 and high concentrations of trace metals (Table 1).\nAlso, As concentrations in these samples are high (2140 lg L?1\n\nAs). Iron concentration in stream waters decreases rapidly\ndownstream with pH rising. Arsenic concentration decreases\ndownstream with the same pattern of Fe (see sample\nZZ \u2013 Fe = 0.13 mg L?1 and As = 4 lg L?1). These results show that\nFe and As are the most rapidly depleted elements from AMD and\nindicates that concentrations of Fe and As decreases by dilution\nas well as by the formation of precipitate. It is well known that\nAs adsorbs and/or coprecipitates and forms compounds with ferric\noxyhydroxide (Dove and Rimstidt, 1985).\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nThe present study characterizes the Z\u00eazere river hidrogeochem-\nistry on the basis of physicochemical properties of waters with dif-\nferent locations regarding the tailings: Z\u00eazere river \u2013 two samples\ncollected upstream both tailings representing the local background\nhydrochemistry; two samples collected downstream the tailings;\nCasinhas stream \u2013 three samples downstream Barroca Grande tail-\ning; seepage waters \u2013 three samples collected in Rio tailing base-\nment and affected by acid mine drainage and one sample from\nBarroca Grande mine adit. The seepage and Casinhas stream waters\nwere characterized as (Ca2+ + Mg2+) SO2?4 water type while the up-\nstream Z\u00eazere river waters are Na-bicarbonate and the down-\nstream Z\u00eazere river waters were classified as being mixed Mg2+\n\nand Ca2+ bicarbonate/sulfate waters. The acid effluents are\nneutralized with lime Ca(OH)2 promoting metal precipitation and\nPlease cite this article in press as: Candeias, C., et al. Acid mine drainage from t\nAfr. Earth Sci.

After the treatment clean water\nis conducted to the ore dressing plant, or discharged directly in\nthe Z\u00eazere river.\n\nBy means of the USGS geochemical code PHREEQC, speciation\nwas performed and shows that the seepage waters are undersatu-\nrated in most of the silicate minerals and clay minerals and the sul-\nfates are nearly in equilibrium state. The Z\u00eazere river waters are\noversaturated in some of the silicate minerals and clay minerals\nand are undersaturated in sulfates. The majority of the Casinhas\nstream and the Z\u00eazere river waters are oversaturated in gibbsite.\nAn increase in sulfate activity may promote the formation of sul-\nfate minerals when the aqueous solution is rich in cations such\nas Ca, Al and K. Acid mine drainage discharged from Rio tailing\nhas pH around 3 and high metal concentration. It was observed\nthat Fe and As are the elements where the concentrations quickly\ndecreases due to adsorption and coprecipitation with ferric oxyhy-\ndroxides. Melanterite and minor amounts of rozenite and\nszomolnokite were observed on Rio tailing basement.\n\nNevertheless the Z\u00eazere river and the three water reservoir\ndams located downstream of the Panasqueira mining area: Cabril\ndam (near Panasqueira mine, is one of the biggest Portuguese\ndams, high of 136 m, and originates one of the biggest water re-\nserves in the country with capacity of 720,000,000 m3), Bou\u00e7\u00e3\ndam (located between the Cabril dam and the Castelo de Bode\ndam, has a high of 63 m and a total capacity of 48,400,000 m3)\nand Castelo de Bode dam (placed in the limits of Tomar and Abran-\ntes districts, is one of the most important Portuguese dams, pre-\nsenting a high of 115 m and a total capacity of 1,095,000,000 m3,\nand is used for water supply of Lisbon city and neighbor districts)\npresents, respectively, water with quality compatible with human\nconsume but not for recreation and sportive proposes or fishing\nsupport life; the Bou\u00e7\u00e3 dam presents water quality compatible\nwith human consume, recreation and sportive proposes and also\nwith fishing support life and the Castelo de Bode dam presents\ngood water quality for all proposes (e-Ecorisk, 2007). In the near\ndownstream valley area of Panasqueira mine, presently, there are\nno aquifer systems or areas with hydrological contamination, nev-\nertheless, a catastrophic spill from the Rio tailing and open air\nimpoundment, could be a potential danger and a huge hazard for\nZ\u00eazere river and the referred water reservoir dams and, obviously,\nfor the entire environment.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis research was funded by the European Commission through\nthe e-Ecorisk Project (# EVG1-2002-25 0068) \u2018\u2018A regional enter-\nprise network decision-support system for environmental risk\nand disaster management of large-scale industrial spills\u2019\u2019.\n\nReferences\n\n\u00c1vila, P.F., Ferreira da Silva, E., Salgueiro, A.R., Farinha, J.A., 2008.

Francisco de Assis village due to the mining activities. Rhizo-\nsphere samples, vegetables (Solanum tubersum sava and Brassica oler\u00e1cea L.) which constitute an impor-\ntant part of the local human diet), irrigation waters and road dusts were collected in private residences in\nS. Francisco de Assis village. According to the Ontario guidelines (Ministry of Environment, 2011), the\nArsenic contents in the rhizosphere soils exceed 20 times the reference value for agricultural soils\n(11 mg kg?1). The result obtained showed that some edible plants frequently used in the region could\nbe enriched in these metals/metalloids and may represent a serious hazard if consumed. The potatoes\ntend to have a preferential accumulation in the leaves and roots while in cabbages most elements have\na preferential accumulation in the roots. An index of the risk for residents, due to ingesting of these met-\nals/metalloids, by consuming vegetables grown around the sampling area, was calculated and the result\nindicates that the inhabitants of S. Francisco de Assis village are probably exposed to some potential\nhealth risks through the intake of arsenic, cadmium and also lead via consuming their vegetables.\n\n? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Europe have an unquestionably importance in\nthe world economy and mineral extraction plays an important role\nin the supply as also in the consumption of all groups of explored\nminerals. Portugal holds a rich and complex geology, which gives it\na considerable mineral potential, although this sector only contrib-\nutes with 1% for the Portuguese Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nThe main mineral resources in Portugal are copper (Cu), tin (Sn),\ntungsten (W), lithium (Li), gold (Au), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb),\nuranium (U), coal, raw materials for construction and ornamental\nstones. Portugal is a country with a long mining tradition; it had\nin the past and still has a strong mining activity. Land pollution\ndue to mining activities is a major issue in many European coun-\ntries and Portugal is not an exception (Santos Oliveira and \u00c1vila,\n1995, 2003; Valente and Leal Gomes, 1998; Bobos et al., 2006;\nLu\u00eds et al., 2009; Santos Oliveira et al., 2002; \u00c1vila et al., 2005,\n2008; Salgueiro et al., 2008; Grangeia et al., 2011; Candeias et al.,\n2011a,b; Ferreira da Silva et al., 2005; Antunes et al., 2002; Pinto\net al., 2004; Carvalho et al., 2009, 2012; Gomes et al., 2010).\n\nThe extraction of metals from sulphide minerals usually results\nin large amounts of waste materials, tailings, and acid mine drain-\nages, which often contain high concentrations of potentially toxic\nelements (PTE \u2013 As, Cu, Zn, Cd as an example) (Moore and Luoma,\n1990; Boulet and Larocque, 1998; Jung, 2001; Naicker et al., 2003).\nMetals/metalloids can be dispersed downstream due to the weath-\nering and erosion process of tailings. Thus, the extent and degree of\nheavy metal contamination around the mines varies depending\nupon geochemical characteristics and mineralization of tailings.\na mine\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2013.07.009\nmailto:paula.avila@lneg.pt\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2013.07.009\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/08832927\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/apgeochem\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2013.07.009\n\n\n2 C. Candeias et al. / Applied Geochemistry xxx (2013) xxx\u2013xxx\nHigh concentrations of heavy metals can be found in and around\nabandoned and active mines due to the discharge and dispersion\nof mine waste materials into nearby soils, food crops and stream\nsediments (Lee et al., 2001; Jung, 2001; McKenzie and Pulford,\n2002; Witte et al., 2004). This will \u2018\u2018eventually\u2019\u2019 lead to a loss of bio-\ndiversity, amenity, and economic well-being as well as pose a po-\ntential health risk to residents in the vicinity of the mining area\n(Verner and Ramsey, 1996; Lee et al., 2001; Wong et al., 2002;\nGal\u00e1n et al., 2003).\n\nSoils are very prone to contamination from hydrological sources\nand also from atmospheric sources. When soils are the receptor of\ntailings drainage coming from metal mining and smelting this\nwaste disposal causes a major impact, posing serious environmen-\ntal concerns. The smelter emissions as well as wind-blown dust\nfrom mine tailings and smelter slag dumps are generally the main\npoint sources of metal/metalloid (As, Cd, Cr. . .) soil pollution (Ettler\net al., 2005, 2009, 2011, 2012; Kr?\u00edbek et al., 2010; \u0160r\u00e1c?ek et al.,\n2010; V\u00edtkov\u00e1 et al., 2010). Exposure to these hazardous elements\nmay have different pathways, through the ingestion of vegetables\ngrown on contaminated soils or through dust inhalation and dust\nadhering to plants. According to several authors (Bosso and Enzwe-\niler, 2008; Chen et al., 2009; Douay et al., 2008; Juhasz et al., 2011;\nRoussel et al., 2010; Ettler et al., 2012) the studies dealing with the\nbioavailability and bioaccessibility of metals/metalloids contami-\nnants in highly-polluted soils are extremely useful in understand-\ning the possible effect on biota, and particularly on human health\ndue to the exposure to those contaminants (Banza et al., 2009;\nRoussel et al., 2010; Coelho et al., 2007).\n\nIn a previous paper from the same authors (Ferreira da Silva\net al., 2013) the environmental contamination impact on S. Fran-\ncisco de Assis (SFA) agricultural and residential soils due to the\nmining activities has been investigated.\n\nThe objectives of this study are: (a) the assessment of the levels\nof soil contamination in respect to median concentrations of PTE in\nthe region; (b) the determination of the associations between the\ndifferent PTE and their spatial distribution; (c) the identification\nof possible sources of contamination that can explain the spatial\npatterns of soil pollution in the SFA area; (d) determine the associ-\nations between the different toxic elements and identify the possi-\nble contamination sources that can explain the risk to the SFA\npopulation by the ingestion of some metals/metalloids by consum-\ning vegetables that grow in their yards located in the mine vicinity.\n2. The study area\n\nThe Panasqueira mine is located in Central Portugal (Fig. 1a).\nNowadays the economic exploitation is located in Barroca Grande\nas well as the beneficiation plant. S. Francisco de Assis is a little vil-\nlage, with 16.24 km2 and 692 inhabitants, located downstream the\nBarroca Grande tailings deposit and impoundments. The topogra-\nphy ranges in altitude from 350 to 1080 m (Reis, 1971), with deep\nvalleys. The streams are generally dry in the summer and flooded\nin the winter.\n\nClimate, which can be an important instability factor, is aggres-\nsive in the Panasqueira region, with hot and dry conditions during\nthe summer and very cold, rainy, and windy conditions in the win-\nter. The mean annual rain precipitation in the region is 1200\u2013\n1400 mm; snow fall is frequent, particularly above the altitude of\n700 m. The annual mean temperature is ?12 ?C, ranging from\n?0 ?C during the winter to about ?30 ?C in summer. The evapo-\ntranspiration in this region is around 1080 mm (\u00c1vila et al.,\n2008). Table 1 shows the wind speed in Barroca Grande at an ele-\nvation of 80 m (Costa, 2004; Costa and Estanqueiro, 2006a,b). Re-\nsults point out that NNW is the preferential wind direction in the\narea (Fig. 1b), and as we know the wind that blows from NW goes\nPlease cite this article in press as: Candeias, C., et al. Heavy metal pollution\n(Portugal). Appl. Geochem. (2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2\nto SE, and that is precisely the direction of S. Francisco de Assis\nregarding the Barroca Grande tailing position.\n\nGeology and Mineralization: The Panasqueira ore deposit is a\ntypical example of a Sn\u2013W hydrothermal mineralization associated\nwith the Hercynian plutonism. A detailed description of the local\ngeology was presented in \u00c1vila et al. (2008). The Panasqueira de-\nposit consists of a series of stacked, sub-horizontal, hydrothermal\nquartz veins intruding into the Beira schists formation of upper\nPrecambrian\u2013Cambrian age and shales. The paragenesis is com-\nplex. Four stages of mineral formation are generally accepted by\nmost of the authors who have studied this deposit: 1st stage: the\noxide\u2013silicate phase (quartz, wolframite; cassiterite); 2nd stage:\nthe main sulphide phase (pyrite, arsenopyrite, pyrrothite, sphaler-\nite, chalcopyrite); 3rd stage: the pyrrothite alteration phase (mar-\ncasite, siderite, galena, Pb\u2013Bi\u2013Ag sulphosalts); and 4th stage: the\nlate carbonate phase (dolomite, calcite) (Breiter, 2001; Corr\u00eaa de\nS\u00e1 et al., 1999; Correa and Naique, 1998; Noronha et al., 1992).\nAt Panasqueira, more than 65 minerals, including sulphides, sul-\nphosalts, oxides, carbonates, silicates, phosphates, and tungstate\nminerals, have been identified (Kelly and Rye, 1979). In general,\nthe most common minerals in addition to quartz are: wolframite,\npyrite, pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, cassiterite, beryl,\nmica, and fluorite. The Panasqueira mine has many rare minerals\nthat can only be observed microscopically, making it a site of spe-\ncific scientific importance.\n\nMining Activity and Potential Environmental Considerations: the\nPanasqueira hydrothermal mineralization is the biggest Sn\u2013W de-\nposit of the Western Europe, and has been in operation since 1896\nto the present date. The economic exploitation mainly focused on\nwolframite, cassiterite, and chalcopyrite, the last two as by-prod-\nucts. On mean the \u2018\u2018tout-venant\u2019\u2019 contains 0.3% WO3; the three final\nconcentrates contain 75% WO3, 72% SnO2, and 22% Cu together\nwith significant amounts of silver (Ag). At the present time, exploi-\ntation is focused at Barroca Grande. The long history of exploitation\nand ore treatment operations are testified by the presence of tail-\nings and other debris (Cavey and Gunning, 2006; \u00c1vila et al.,\n2008). Nowadays, the waste rock is still placed in the Barroca\nGrande tailings area. The mine wastes were and still are discharged\nin a huge tailings pile and in two mud dams, one is old and deac-\ntivated, although stabilized in geotechnical terms, while the other\n(smaller and disposed over the tailings) is still being fed with ster-\niles (some rich in sulphides, arsenopyrite is the main sulphide\npresent) obtained from the ore dressing operations. Mining exploi-\ntation and ore processing operations left and continue to leave be-\nhind huge tailings, being Barroca Grande ?7 Mm3 with two mud\ndams ?1.2 Mm3, one of the main tailings deposit in the mine area.\nThe mining and beneficiation processes at the site produces metal/\nmetalloid rich mine wastes. According \u00c1vila et al. (2008) the re-\njected materials from the ore processing, containing high concen-\ntrations of metals, stored in the open-air impoundments are\nresponsible for the continuous generation of acid drainage. Barroca\nGrande impoundment shows high concentrations of As, Cd, Cu and\nZn. The analysis of the fine grained materials existing in the two\nBarroca Grande open impoundments reveals the existence of arse-\nnopyrite, ferberite, sphalerite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, natrojarosite,\nscorodite and hematite.\n\nThese tailings and impoundments are exposed to atmospheric\nconditions. Surface runoff and water percolation leach the tailings\nand form AMD. The tailings piles at Barroca Grande are adjacent to\nthe small, but perennially flowing, Casinhas Stream, which drains\nto the Z\u00eazere River. The unconfined tailings and open impound-\nments are the main source of pollution in the surrounding area\nonce the oxidation of sulphides can result in the mobilization\nand migration of trace metals from the mining wastes into the\nenvironment, releasing contaminants into the ecosystem.

Values of\npH, electric conductivity (EC), oxidation\u2013reduction potential\n(ORP), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and\nSalinity (SAL) of the waters were recorded at each site using a\nmultiparametric probe HI9828 with GPS from HANNA Instru-\nments. Samples were filtered on-site through 0.45-lm Millipore\nmembrane filters using an all-plastic pressurized filtering\nsystem. The concentrations of HCO3 were determined in situ\nby volumetric titration on filtered unacidified samples. Samples\nfor metal analysis were immediately preserved after collection\nin the field, with pH reduction to 2.0 using HNO3, avoiding Fe\nhydroxide precipitation. All the water samples were stored at\n4 ?C pending further analysis.\nin mine\u2013soil\u2013plant system in S.

Sample preparation and chemical analysis\n\nRhizosphere soil, dusts and vegetable samples: the fine grained\nfraction of rhizosphere soils dust and vegetables was submitted\nto multi-elemental analysis in ACME Anal. ISO 9002 Accredited\nLab-Canada. A 0.5 g split was leached in hot (95 ?C) aqua regia\n(HCl\u2013HNO3\u2013H2O) for 1 h. After dilution to 10 ml with demineral-\nized water, the solutions were analyzed by Inductively Coupled\nPlasma-Emission Spectrometry (ICP-ES) for 35 chemical elements.\nIncluded in this analytical package were silver (Ag), aluminium\n(Al), arsenic (As), gold (Au), barium (Ba), bismuth (Bi), calcium\n(Ca), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron\n(Fe), gallium (Ga), mercury (Hg), potassium (K), lanthanum (La),\nmagnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), sodium\n(Na), nickel (Ni), phosphorus (P), lead (Pb), sulphur (S), antimony\n(Sb), scandium (Sc), selenium (Se), strontium (Sr), thorium (Th),\ntitanium (Ti), vanadium (V), tungsten (W) and zinc (Zn). The accu-\nracy and analytical precision were determined using analyses of\nreference materials (standards C3 and G-2) and duplicate samples\nin each analytical set. The results were within the 95% confidence\nlimits of the recommended values given for this certified material.\nThe relative standard deviation was between 5% and 10%.\n\nSoil pH the procedure adopted was modified from ISO\n10390:1994 Soil.; the pH was determined with samples in diluted\nCaCl2, and measures taken 24 h after.\n\nSoil Organic Matter (SOM): the procedure was adapted from Ree-\nuwijk (2002); The SOM was quantified in 5 g dried samples, after\n20 h in a 430 ?C muffle.\n\nMineralogy: the mineral constituents in selected solid media\nsamples were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) at LNEG. The\nmineralogical composition was determined using a Philips X\u2019Pert\nMPD machine equipped with Cu Ka radiation, graphite monochro-\nmator automatic divergence slit, and 0.5-receiving slit. A step size\nof 0.05\u20132 h, a scan setting of 2\u201370\u20132 h, and a 10 s counting time\nwere chosen.\n\nWaters samples samples were analyzed without pre-concentra-\ntion. The analyzed elements include major anions (Cl?, NO?3 , and\nSO2?4 ), major cations (Ca, K, Na, and Mg), as well a suite of dissolved\ntrace elements (Al, As, B, Cd, Cl, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, and Zn). Unacidified\nsamples were analyzed using a Dionex 2000i ion chromatography\nand a SPECTRAPHYSICS integrator. The concentrations of major\ncations and trace elements in acidified waters were all determined\nby mass inductive plasma spectrometry (ICP-MS) in the ACME\nAnal. ISO 9002 Accredited Lab-Canada. Reagent blanks and dupli-\ncate samples were inserted into each batch for quality control\n(Ramsey et al., 1987). Depending on the concentration levels, typ-\nical uncertainties, including all error sources, are less than 6% for\nthe trace elements, and between 2% and 7% for the major anions.\nThe limit of detection for the analyzed trace metals is about\n0.05\u201310 mg L?1. In this work As (III) and As (total) were deter-\nmined by Cathodic Stripping Voltammetry (CSV) (Ferreira and Bar-\nros, 2002), using a hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE). The\nmethod requires hydrogen chloride (HCl) 1 M as electrolyte sup-\nport and the presence of Cu (II), as it involves the preconcentration\nof a copper\u2013arsenic intermetallic compound at the mercury elec-\ntrode. The determination of As (T) involves the reduction of As\n(V) with thiosulfate and the subsequent determination of As (III);\nAs (V) is obtained by difference. The Fe (III) concentration is ob-\ntained by difference between the concentrations of Fe (T) and Fe\n(II), being Fe (II) determined by a colorimetric method and Fe (T)\nby another method such AEOS-ICP or AAS after reduction of Fe\n(III). In this work, Fe (III), Fe (II) and Fe (T) will be determined by\na colour spectrophotometric-Vis method using FerroZine Iron Re-\nagent. The method requires preservation of water samples by fil-\ntration through a 0.2 lm membrane and acidification to pH 1\nwith HCl (0.4%HCl), and storage in the dark (To et al., 1999).\nPlease cite this article in press as: Candeias, C., et al.

Data analysis\n\nEnrichment Index one common approach to estimate metal\nconcentrations is to compute an index that averages the accumula-\ntion of each metal in each sample. To evaluate the degree of trace\nmetal contamination in soils the Enrichment Index (EI) (\u00c1vila et al.,\n2008; Ferreira da Silva et al., 2005; Kim et al., 1998; Lee et al.,\n1998; Chon et al., 1995; Nishida et al., 1982) was calculated by\naveraging the ratios of the elements concentrations (mg kg?1) to\nthe permissible level (PL). In this study eight elements (As, Cd,\nCu, Mn, Pb, V, W, Zn) were selected to calculate the Ei in each\nsample. The PL is the element concentration in the soil, from which\ncrops produced are considered as unsafe for human health\n(As = 20 mg kg?1; Cd = 3 mg kg?1; Cu = 100 mg kg?1; Mn =\n394 mg kg?1; Pb = 85 mg kg?1; V = 50 mg kg?1; W = 1 mg kg?1;\nZn = 140 mg.kg?1; Ferreira, 2004; Reimann and De Caritat, 1998;\nKloke, 1979). This index is useful to evaluate the degree of multiple\nelement contamination. An Enrichment Index over 1.0 indicates\nthat, on average, metal concentrations are above the permissible\nlevel, though element enrichment may be from anthropogenic\ninputs or natural geological sources (Nimick and Moore, 1991).\n\nTotal metal concentration in vegetables the total metal content\nfor each vegetable (TP) was calculated using the following formula:\nTP \u00bc\n\u00f0Rdw ? Rec\u00de\u00fe\u00f0Sdw ? Sec\u00de\u00fe\u00f0Ldw ? Lec\u00de\u00fe\u00f0Tdw ?

The EDEM was calculated\naccording the formula.\nEDEM \u00bc\ndaily intake of metals\u00f0DIM\u00de\n\nbody weight\n\u00f02\u00de\nDIM \u00bc daily vegetable consumption\n? mean vegetable metal concentration \u00f03\u00de\nconsidering the average daily intake of metals present in 345 g of\nvegetables per day for adult residents (Luo et al., 2011; JECFA,\n1993); the body weight of an adult resident was set to 60 kg in\nthe present study.\n\nCalculation of health risk: in this study, the health risk associated\nwith the consumption of vegetables was defined as the ratio of the\nestimated daily intake of metals to the reference dose oral (RfDo)\nfor each metal (Luo et al., 2011; JECFA, 1993), as in the following\nequation.\nRisk index \u00bc\nEDEM\nRfDo\n\n\u00f04\u00de\nwhere RfDo represents safe levels of exposure by oral intake for a\nlifetime (JECFA, 1993). If the risk index was less than 1, no obvious\nrisk is involved. If the risk index was equal to or higher than 1, there\nis a potential health risk, and related interventions and protective\nmeasurements should be taken. In the present study, metals/metal-\nloids concerned were As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn, and only the chronic\nrisk RfDo was considered in the risk assessments (Luo et al., 2011).\nin mine\u2013soil\u2013plant system in S.

Rhizosphere soils\nPrevious study carried out in the area by the same team (Cande-\n\nias et al., 2012), determined the contents of selected elements in\nsoils samples, collected in two depths, from superficial soil (A)\nand from a depth of 15\u201320 cm (B). Superficial soil samples allowed\nthe characterization of superficial contamination coming from the\ntailings, while B soil samples makes possible the establishment of\nthe local geochemical background. To evaluate the presence of pos-\nsible local anomalies, the mean, median and maximum contents of\nthe rhizosphere soils were compared with the results obtained for\nthe horizon B.\n\nTable 2 presents the median values of pH and SOM in soil sam-\nples. The rhizosphere soils shows a median pH of 6.3 and are clas-\nsified according to the United States Department of Agriculture\n(www.nrcs.usda.gov) as slightly acid (6.1 &lt;pH &lt;6.5) while the\ngeogenic soils from horizon B (median pH = 4.2) are classified as\nacidic soils (3.5 &lt;pH &lt;4.4). The SOM present median values of\n12.2% in rhizosphere soils and 10.2% in horizon B soils, showing\nthat these soils are medium organic soils with 10% &lt;SOM &lt;30%\n(Perrin, 1974).\n\nSoil pH and SOM strongly affect soil functions and plant nutri-\nent availability. Specifically, pH influences chemical solubility\nand availability of plant essential nutrients, pesticide performance,\nand organic matter decomposition. SOM serves multiple functions\nTable 2\nMean, median and maximum values and its difference (DF) from the SFA rhizosphere soils\ncontents are in bold).

For all these elements, the\ndifference between both kinds of samples clearly shows that there\nare higher contents in rhizosphere soils when compared with local\ngeochemical background. The behaviour of the elements in the\nrhizosphere soils may reflect the influence of the Barroca Grande\ntailings and open impoundments, due to wind dispersion and\ndeposition.\n\nAccording to \u00c1vila et al. (2008), the Barroca Grande tailings and\nopen impoundments have high As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Sn, W, and Zn con-\ncentrations (mean content in the more coarse tailings material\nAs = 7142 mg kg?1; Cd = 56 mg kg?1; Cu = 2501 mg kg?1; Pb =\n172 mg kg?1; Sn = 679 mg kg?1; W = 5400 mg kg?1 and Zn =\n1689 mg kg?1 and mean content in the impoundment material\n(rejected from the mill operations) As = 44,252 mg kg?1; Cd =\n491 mg kg?1; Cu = 4029 mg kg?1; Pb = 166 mg kg?1; Sn = 454 mg\nkg?1; W = 3380 mg kg?1 and Zn = 3738 mg kg?1).

Weathering of sulphide-rich materi-\nals results in AMD at the Panasqueira mine. During runoff events,\nrain water infiltrates the tailings and dissolves secondary minerals,\nproducing strongly acidic water (pH 3.0 \u00c1vila et al., 2008). The low\npH keeps the trace elements dissolved and increases remobiliza-\ntion and spatial distribution. This scenario leads to the high con-\ntents of metals verified in the village agricultural soils, some of\nthem with acid pH and others near neutral pH (5.1 &lt;pH &lt;6.9).\nAccording to McCauley et al. (2009) acid conditions occur in soil\nhaving parent material high in silica, high levels of sand with low\nbuffering capacities (ability to resist pH change), and in regions\nwith high amounts of precipitation. An increase in precipitation\ncauses increased leaching of base cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+)\nand the soil pH is lowered. Acidic soils are most commonly found\nin areas where soils were formed from siliceous parental material,\nforest soils, mining sites containing pyrite (McCauley et al., 2009).\n\nConsidering that the sampling area is located in an inhabited\nvillage and that the local population strongly depends on the use\nof soil for their subsistence (agriculture, cattle breeding and for-\nestry), it is useful to compare the As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo,\nNi, Pb, Sb, Zn concentrations in soil with the reference values\nproposed by the Ontario Soil Quality Guidelines (Ministry of the\nEnvironment, 2011) and also with the national median concentra-\ntions proposed by Ferreira (2004) (Table 3).\n\nAccording to these values, the soils from SFA exceed, for exam-\nple, for As twenty times the Ontario reference value for agricultural\nsoils (11 mg kg?1) and 10 times the national median concentra-\ntions (22 mg kg?1) proposed by Ferreira (2004). The estimated EI\nvalues for soils are elevated ranging from 1.0 to 12.2 (Fig. 3),\nmainly due to the presence of significant contents of As, Cu and\nalso Cd and Pb. Comparison to the Ontario guidelines indicates that\nthe majority of the samples exceed the severe effect level for As\nand Cu (100% of samples), Cd (50% of samples), Pb (53% of samples)\nand Zn (47% of samples) and so are deemed \u2018\u2018grossly polluted\u2019\u2019.\n\nAccording to Ferreira da Silva et al. (2013) the high levels of As\nin these soils seems to be linked to sulphides, since a considerable\nproportion is extracted by aqua regia (F4 \u2013 66.7\u201368.4%). This high\npercentage associated with sulphides reflects the presence of arse-\nnopyrite in the samples. Amorphous and crystalline Fe and Mn\noxyhydroxides (F3) seems to be also important metal bearing-\nphases. The percentage of easily mobilized phases is very low\n(0.04\u20130.05%); however, the As concentrations associated with this\nextraction values (0.4\u20130.7 mg kg?1) may be considered very high.\nAlso according the same author Cd, Cu and Pb show high (and sim-\nTable 3\nReference values proposed by the Ontario Soils Quality Guidelines (Ministry of the\nEnvironment, 2011) and Ferreira (2004).\n\nMinistry of the\nEnvironment (2011)\n\nFerreira (2004) Rhizosphere\nmean\n\nAs 11 22 223.6\nBa 210 163 192.8\nCd 1.0 \u2013 1.3\nCo 19 19 10.7\nCr 67 43 37.8\nCu 62 35 163.7\nMn \u2013 \u2013 531.3\nMo 0.6 \u2013 0.6\nNi 37 43 24.7\nPb 45 34 58.6\nSb 1.0 \u2013 0.6\nZn 290 85 323.2\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Candeias, C., et al.

Exposure to\nhazardous elements may have different pathways, being one of\nthem the ingestion of vegetables grown on contaminated soils.\n4.1.2. Road dusts\nRoad dust originated from the interaction of solid, liquid and\n\ngaseous materials are produced from different sources and depos-\nited on a road. The composition and quantity of chemical matrix of\nroad dust are indicators of environmental pollution (Banerjee,\n2003). Road dust receives varying inputs of heavy metals from\ndiversity of mobile or stationary sources such as vehicles emis-\nsions, industrial plants, power generation plants, oil burning, waste\nincineration, construction and demolition activities as well as\nresuspension of surrounding contaminated soils (Ahmed and Ishi-\nga, 2006; Al-Khashman, 2007; Atiemo et al., 2011). These inputs\ncontribute significantly to the pollution of urban environment. This\nmakes the study of road dust important for determining the origin,\ndistribution and level of heavy metal in urban surface environ-\nments. Elevated levels of heavy metal contents are the result of hu-\nman activities and as a result, the adverse effects of poor\nenvironmental conditions on human health are most evident in\nthe affected environments.\nTable 4\nMean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation (SD) and skewness values (SK) of t\n(according to http://acmelab.com/).\n\nElement Units DL Mean Median\n\nAg mg kg?1 0.1 1.95 1.00\nAl % 0.01 1.10 1.15\nAs mg kg?1 0.5 810.15 469.90\nAu mg kg?1 0.5 10.58 3.60\nBa mg kg?1 1 43.15 40.00\nBi mg kg?1 0.1 9.86 6.30\nCa % 0.01 0.57 0.40\nCd mg kg?1 0.1 5.39 3.20\nCo mg kg?1 0.1 7.18 6.90\nCr mg kg?1 1 20.08 20.00\nCu mg kg?1 0.1 338.91 326.40\nFe % 0.01 2.46 2.25\nGa mg kg?1 1 3.92 4.00\nHg mg kg?1 0.01 0.01 0.01\nK % 0.01 0.34 0.34\nLa mg kg?1 1 11.08 11.00\nMg % 0.01 0.37 0.38\nMn mg kg?1 1 258.15 224.00\nMo mg kg?1 0.1 0.92 0.60\nNa % 0.001 0.02 0.02\nNi mg kg?1 0.1 17.77 19.10\nP % 0.001 0.08 0.07\nPb mg kg?1 0.1 43.86 31.30\nS % 0.05 0.43 0.20\nSb mg kg?1 0.1 1.02 0.70\nSc mg kg?1 0.1 1.76 1.70\nSe mg kg?1 0.5 0.57 0.25\nSr mg kg?1 1 17.00 16.00\nTh mg kg?1 0.1 5.17 5.10\nTi % 0.001 0.05 0.05\nTl mg kg?1 0.1 0.71 0.60\nV mg kg?1 2 22.38 23.00\nW mg kg?1 0.1 36.15 22.70\nZn mg kg?1 1 464.38 370.00\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Candeias, C., et al.

The adverse effects of heavy metals in road\ndust include respiratory system disorders, nervous system inter-\nruptions, endocrine system malfunction, immune system suppres-\nsion and the risk of cancer in later life (Ferreira-Baptista and De\nMiguel, 2005).\n\nMost mining and quarrying wastes obtained from grinding of\nrocks are placed in deposits in specific locations/regions and can\nbe reused in earthworks and construction, in particular the coarser\nfractions. Typical applications include use in asphalt pavements. In\nthe SFA area, the main concern focuses on dust associated with\nmining operations due to vehicles moving at the top of the Barroca\nGrande tailings deposit to load the coarse rejected materials from\nthe mining exploration (Fig. 4).\n\nThe statistical parameters calculated from the \u2018\u2018total\u2019\u2019 contents\nof the road dust samples are shown in Table 4.\n\nFrom Table 4 it was notice that some elements have a strong\npositive asymmetry, due to the presence of \u2018\u2018outliers\u2019\u2019, namely,\nAg, As, Au, Ca, Cd, Hg, Mo, Na, Pb, S, Sb, Se and Zn (with values\nabove 1.5). Most of these elements present mean values signifi-\ncantly higher than their median values. Nevertheless, it is impor-\ntant to emphasize the most critical elements in contamination\nterms and as potential hazardous elements. For example, As rang-\ning between 61.9 mg kg?1 and 3564.9 mg kg?1; Cd from a mini-\nmum of 0.3 mg kg?1 and a maximum of 19.4 mg kg?1 and Cu\nbetween 51.6 mg kg?1 and 766.0 mg kg?1, poses a severe danger\nfor the village inhabitants affecting their health once these dust\nlay down in soils, vegetables and animals drinking water.\n\nOnce again, it is useful to compare the dust contents with refer-\nence values and acceptable risk values.

For a\nbetter visualization, Fig. 5 shows the cartography of the As, Cd\nand Cu road dust contents according the reference values presents\nin Table 5.\n\nThese high contents are caused by a great wind dispersion\nmechanism in this area (see Table 1). According to these results\nFig. 5. Cartography of road dust contents for As, Cd and Cu (Google Earth image\nmodified).\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Candeias, C., et al.

Indeed As, by its toxicity, may have chronic\nhealth effects that may be local or systemic. The lung cancer is re-\ngarded as the most critical effect that results from inhalation of\nparticles of Arsenic (WHO, 2000). Cadmium when present in the\natmosphere and in food can cause severe kidney problems. More-\nover the dispersion of Pb existing in dust, if particles are at an in-\nhaled size e.g. PM10 and PM2.5, could be worrying, especially for\nchildren, primarily due to blood diseases which become frequent\nwhen humans are exposed to this element (WHO, 2000).\n4.1.3. Waters\nIn SFA the local population strongly depends on the use of water\n\n(water supply and agriculture), nevertheless most of the inhabit-\nants use the public supply network. In the study area, we chose\nto perform the collection of water samples in private wells\n(UW4, UW6, UW7) one sample (UW5) was collected in a little\nstream (Barroco) and for comparison two samples (UW1, UW8)\nfrom public supply network, all of these waters are used for vege-\ntables irrigation (Table 6).\n\nAccording to the results, the lowest pH values were recorded in\nsamples collected in wells (UW4, UW6 and UW7) having a slightly\nacidic character, according to the parametric values set out in the\nDecree-Law 306/2007 with values between 6.5 and 9.0. The other\nsamples have circumneutral pH. The measured values electric con-\nductivity ranging from 18 to 161 lS cm?1 classifies them as waters\nwith very low mineralization, according to the parametric values\nset out in the Decree-Law 306/2007 with values up to\n2500 lS cm?1. These samples have lower SO2?4 and Cl\n\n? concentra-\ntions but major ions contents tend to increase with the decrease of\npH. Have also low metal concentrations, sometimes Zn and Mn\nwere present in significant concentrations though below the stan-\ndard parametric values. The concentrations of other elements were\nall legally acceptable.\n\nFig. 6 shows the samples representation in a Piper\u2019s diagram.\nTwo distinct hydrochemical facies were determined: (a) UW1,\nUW8 from public network supply, UW5 from Barroco stream and\nthe well UW6 are Ca/Mg\u2013HCO3 waters, and (b) UW4 and UW7 col-\nlected in private wells have a closer facies to the type Ca/Mg\u2013Cl/\nSO4 waters.\n\nComparing the obtained results from the collected samples\nwith the Portuguese criteria values of quality of surface fresh water\nfor human consumption and irrigating waters (Decree-Law 306/\n2007), all the analyzed waters in SFA village are in perfect condi-\ntions to be used by the population.\n\nNevertheless, and because As is a toxic element and because\narsenopyrite is the main sulphide rejected in Panasqueira mine,\nAs and also Fe have been object of chemical speciation according\nin mine\u2013soil\u2013plant system in S.

Vegetables\nMany heavy metals exist in minute amounts in natural agricul-\n\ntural soil, however when their amounts exceed a certain level due\nto pollutants brought from outside, soil contamination occurs and\nagricultural products become contaminated so the consumption of\nlocally produced vegetables may be an important exposure path-\nway for soil contaminants due to agricultural land use. Prolonged\nexposure to heavy metals can cause deleterious health effects in\nhumans. Hence, prediction of metal and metalloid uptake by veg-\netables from contaminated soils is an important part of the Human\nhealth risk assessment.\n\nGiven the high contents, of some metals/metalloids, that were\nrecorded in the soils as well as in the road dusts and the fact that\nmost inhabitants have a diet rich in vegetables, we attempted to\nTable 8\nComparison between total content of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn in rhizosphere soil\n\nDL Site1 Site 2 Site7A Site 9 Site 10 Site 11\nP P P P P P\n\nAs S mg kg?1 0.5 88.5 101.6 71.1 314.9 133 496.6\nAs V mg kg?1 0.1 5.9 2.8 2.8 2 1.5 2.8\nCd S mg kg?1 0.1 0.8 1.2 1.1 2.4 1.9 2.8\nCd V mg kg?1 0.01 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.2 0.3\nCr S mg kg?1 1 5.3 8 6.6 10.6 7.2 25.9\nCr V mg kg?1 0.1 0.4 0.4 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2\nCu S mg kg?1 0.1 56.7 88.0 756.6 194.5 224.1 233.1\nCu V mg kg?1 0.01 12.3 11.6 19.6 11.0 17.0 10.4\nMn S mg kg?1 1 457 475 642 423 322 673\nMn V mg kg?1 1 49.7 28.4 84 11.4 34 16.2\nNi S mg kg?1 0.1 13.9 20.3 21.9 19.9 23.3 28.6\nNi V mg kg?1 0.1 2.1 1.4 1.3 0.4 0.5 0.6\nPb S mg kg?1 0.1 49.0 94.5 93.5 38.1 24.4 66.5\nPb V mg kg?1 0.01 2.5 2.1 1.6 0.3 0.2 0.3\nZn S mg kg?1 1 244 236 364 309 254 374\nZn V mg kg?1 0.1 53.2 37.9 63.9 28.1 58.7 35\n\nP \u2013 Solanum tubersum sava (potato); C \u2013 cabbage.\n\nTable 9\nConcentrations in the different components of Solanum tubersum sava (potato) (T \u2013 tubers\n\nElem.

On the\nwhole, all vegetables that were studied were contaminated by ar-\nsenic, cadmium and lead and they are toxic if continually con-\nsumed. Consumption of heavy metals-contaminated food can\nseriously deplete some essential nutrients in the body causing a\ndecrease in immunological protection, intrauterine growth retar-\ndation, impaired psycho-social behaviour, disabilities associated\nwith malnutrition and a high prevalence of upper gastrointestinal\ncancer (Arora et al., 2008).\ns (S) and vegetables (V).\n\nSite 3 Site 4 Site 5 Site 7B Site 8 Site 12 Site 13 Site 14\nC C C C C C C C\n\n346.4 156.5 98.6 83.9 207.7 130.2 918.6 151.8\n12.8 14.4 8.7 0.8 4.7 0.8 4.1 0.9\n0.7 0.8 0.4 0.8 0.6 1.4 1.3 1\n0.1 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.3 0.2 0.4 0.1\n27 42 45 39 43 33 39 41\n2.2 17.7 87.9 3.4 18.7 3.2 2.0 2.2\n95.4 103.6 66.8 98.5 102.1 110.8 138.5 104.6\n6.7 20.2 18.3 6.3 8.3 5 6.2 3.7\n292 221 255 987 168 1194 826 895\n21.1 270.2 135.7 36.2 57.5 74.4 31.1 21\n13.2 30.6 36.4 20.6 27.9 23.7 27.7 32.5\n0.9 7.6 26.6 0.9 6.2 0.7 0.6 0.3\n146.1 31.3 29.4 48.2 27.8 134.5 32.1 44.3\n1.9 4.2 4.2 1.3 1.7 0.8 0.5 0.2\n551 188 128 439 179 911 256 300\n61.7 176.6 117.6 52.2 104.4 72 64.8 38.2\n\n, L \u2013 leaves, S \u2013 stems and R \u2013 roots).

(2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2\nTable 9 and 10 presents the concentrations distributed by the\ndifferent components (T \u2013 tubercles, L \u2013 leaves, S \u2013 stems and R\n\u2013 Roots) of the two studied species S. tubersum sava and B. oler\u00e1cea\nL.\n\nThe results obtained for the different component of the studied\nvegetable shows that: (a) for potatoes the roots contained maxi-\nmum As (21.9 mg kg?1) followed by leaves (12.5 mg kg?1) and tu-\nbers (3.5 mg kg?1) (Table 9); (b) for cabbages the roots contained\nmaximum As (52.3 mg kg?1) followed by leaves (2.9 mg kg?1) (Ta-\nble 10). Despite the edible parts of vegetables, potatoes tubers and\ncabbage leaves have the lowest As contents, these contents are\nabove the maximum permitted level for vegetables proposed by\nFAO/WHO (2012) guidelines (0.1 mg kg?1). As for Cd, the higher\nconcentration in potatoes is found in roots (4.66 mg kg?1) and in\ntubers (0.52 mg kg?1) both above the FAO/WHO (2012) guidelines\nfor Cd (0.1 mg kg?1) and for leaves cabbages Cd have a maximum\nconcentration of 0.43 mg kg?1 and for cabbages, the roots also have\nthe highest Cd contents (0.56 mg kg?1), again both above the max-\nimum limit considered by the FAO/WHO guidelines. Due to the\nhigh contents of exchangeable Cd in vegetable soils, the Cd in the\nedible parts of vegetables probably came from the root uptake\nfrom soils.\n\nCopper is below the maximum limit regarding the FAO/WHO,\n2012 guidelines (73 mg kg?1) in all parts of the plant of both veg-\netables, and the same pattern is observed for Zn (max limit permis-\nsible 100 mg kg?1) in the potatoes but some cabbages have\nconcentrations above the permissible limit. Nevertheless Cu re-\nveals a preferential accumulation in the leaves and roots in the\npotatoes and Zn cumulates in the stems, and in cabbages Cu pre-\nfers to cumulate in roots and Zn also in the roots.\n\nMetals (Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn) are very tightly bound to the soil\nat high pH and are therefore more available at low pH levels than\nhigh pH levels. In addition to the effects of pH on nutrient availabil-\nity, individual plants and soil organisms also vary in their tolerance\nto alkaline and/or acid soil conditions. Neutral conditions appear to\nbe best for crop growth. As it stated above in rhizosfere soils dis-\ncussion, the pH of the sampled soils ranged 5.1 &lt;pH &lt;6.9 which\nis the considered pH range more favourable for micronutrients\navailability.\n\nAccording to Eqs. (2) and (3), an index of the risk for residents,\ndue to the ingestion of these metals/metalloids, by consuming veg-\netables grown around the sampling area was calculated on the ba-\nsis of the oral reference dose being 0.5 lg kg?1 d?1 for As,\n0.5 lg kg?1 d?1 for Cd, 40 lg kg?1 d?1 for Cu, 3.5 lg kg?1 d?1 for\nPb, and 300 lg kg?1 d?1 for Zn (Luo et al., 2011; JECFA, 1993).\n\nAccording to Table 11 the risk index, in descending order is\nCd &lt;As &lt;Pb &lt;Cu &lt;Zn, and for Cd, As and Pb is higher than 1, while\nthe risk indexes for Cu, and Zn were less than 1. The result indi-\ncates that the inhabitants of SFA village probably are exposed to\nsome potential health risks through the intake of As, Cd and also\nPb via consuming their vegetables. The accumulation of metals in\nthe edible parts of vegetables could have a direct impact on the\nhealth of nearby inhabitants, because vegetables produced from\ngardens are mostly consumed locally. For Cu and Zn, there is no\nsignificant risk from the intake of vegetables.

Candeias et al. / Applied Geochemistry xxx (2013) xxx\u2013xxx 13\net al. (2011), when determining the risk index, it was assumed that\nthe intake is equal to the absorbed dose (USEPA, 1989), which may\nmagnify the effect of the ingested contaminants to some extent,\nbecause part of the heavy metals that were ingested maybe egest-\ned. From this point of view, it is reasonable to think that no obvious\nadverse health effects from exposure to the heavy metals could be\nobserved on those living in the village.\n\nAccording to Luo et al. (2011) and comparing the results with\nother studies (Table 12), the health risk for adults from consuming\nvegetables in this region is comparable to, or even higher than\nthose associated with the consumption of vegetables from gardens\nimpacted by mining, wastewater, irrigation or smelting activities.\n\nFor soil\u2013plant system, heavy metal toxicity threshold is the\nhighest permissible content in the soil (total or bioavailable con-\ncentration) that does not pose any phytotoxic effects or heavy met-\nals in the edible parts of the crops does not exceed food hygiene\nstandards (Islam et al., 2007). The factors that affect the thresholds\nof heavy metal toxicity in soil\u2013vegetable system include the soil\ntype (soil pH, organic matter content, clay mineral and other soil\nchemical and biochemical properties) and the vegetable species,\nthe transport and heavy metal accumulation in each plant. Also\nthe interactions between soils, the plant roots and microbes play\nan important role regarding the heavy metal movement from soil\nto the edible parts of crops (Islam et al., 2007). These are issues that\ncan affect bioavailability and heavy metals accumulation in vegeta-\nbles, subject for a further investigation.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nThe mining and beneficiation process at Panasqueira mine pro-\nduces mine wastes that are largely responsible for the high levels\nof metals/metalloids at the Barroca Grande tailings, releasing con-\nsiderable amounts of heavy metals and metalloids in the surround-\ning soils and water. The metal assemblage identified in the\nrhizosphere soils collected in S. Francisco de Assis village, down-\nstream Barroca Grande tailings deposit, and its behaviour may re-\nflect the influence of the tailings and open impoundments\nmaterials, due to several dispersion agents, including the wind,\nand deposition in soils, vegetables and animals drinking water as\nalso in little creeks used for irrigation. These soils exceed, for\nexample, for As 20 times the Ontario reference value for agricul-\ntural soils (11 mg kg?1) and the estimated values for Enrichment\nPlease cite this article in press as: Candeias, C., et al. Heavy metal pollution\n(Portugal). Appl. Geochem. (2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2\nIndex are elevated ranging (1.0 &lt;EI &lt;12.2) mainly due to the pres-\nence of As, Cu and also Cd and Pb. The high levels of As in these\nsoils seems to be linked to sulphides extracted by aqua regia and\nthis association to sulphides reflects the presence of arsenopyrite\nin soils. The comparison to the Ontario guidelines indicates that\nthese soils are deemed as \u2018\u2018grossly polluted\u2019\u2019. Also the road dusts\nanalyzed exceed the reference acceptable risk and the maximum\nacceptable values for As, Cd, Cu and Zn and these contents results\nfrom a wind dispersion mechanism with a great expression in this\narea. If particles are at an inhaled size e.g. PM10 and PM2.5, could be\nvery worrying. Regarding the sampled waters, some have slightly\nacidic character and the others have circumneutral pH, they have\nvery low mineralization (electric conductivity range from 18 to\n161 lS cm?1) and low SO2?4 and Cl\n\n? concentrations but major ions\ncontents tend to increase with the decrease of pH. Metal and met-\nalloid concentrations are also low and, according the Portuguese\nlaw, legally acceptable.\n\nVegetables grown in the nearby sites were also contaminated,\nin one way, for potatoes there is a preferential accumulation in\nthe roots and leaves while for the cabbage most elements have a\npreferential accumulation in the roots and, in another way, As,\nCd and Pb concentrations are above the maximum permitted level\nfor vegetables proposed by FAO/WHO, which could be a potential\nhealth concern to local residents. The risk index for residents deter-\nmined, due to the ingestion of the metals and metalloids, reveal\nthat Cd, As and Pb represents an hazard for the inhabitants of S.\nFrancisco de Assis village, once they are probably exposed to some\npotential health risks through the intake of As, Cd and also Pb\ntrough the of ingesting these metals, by consuming vegetables\ngrown in their yards.\n\nThis research requires further studies to establish the metals\ntransfer process from soil to the different parts of the plants, to\nunderstand their bioavailability and to identify the bioaccumula-\ntion patterns based in indicators as Biological Absorption Coeffi-\ncient for each element.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis research is funded by the Portuguese Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a\nCi\u00eancia e a Tecnologia (FCT) \u2013 through two grants: SFRH/BD/\n63349/2009 and SFRH/BPD/45884/2008.\nin mine\u2013soil\u2013plant system in S.

In order to investigate the\nenvironmental contamination impact on S. Francisco de\nAssis (village located between the two major impoundments\nand tailings) agricultural soils, a geochemical survey was\nundertaken to assess toxic metals associations, related levels\nand their spatial distribution, and to identify the possible\ncontamination sources. According to the calculated conta-\nmination factor, As and Zn have a very high contamination\nfactor giving rise to 65.4 % of samples with a moderate to\nhigh pollution degree; 34.6 % have been classified as nil to\nvery low pollution degree. The contamination factor spatial\ndistribution put in evidence the fact that As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and\nZn soils contents, downstream Barroca Grande tailing, are\nincreased when compared with the local Bk soils. The\n\nmechanical dispersion, due to erosion, is the main contam-\nination source. The chemical extraction demonstrates that\nthe trace metals distribution and accumulation in S.\nFrancisco de Assis soils is related to sulfides, but also to\namorphous or poorly crystalline iron oxide phases. The\npartitioning study allowed understanding the local chemical\nelements mobility and precipitation processes, giving rise to\nthe contamination dispersion model of the study area. The\nwind and hydrological factors are responsible for the chem-\nical elements transport mechanisms, the water being the\nmain transporter medium and soils as one of the possible\nretention media.\n\nKeywords Soil contamination .

Panasqueira mining area\n\nIntroduction\n\nMetal mining processing and smelting have been recognized\nas a major contributor to environmental pollution, providing\nsources of heavy metals that may lead to the contamination of\nthe surrounding environment (Adriano 1986; Benvenuti et al.\n1995; Gray 1997; Liu et al. 2003; Zhou et al. 2007). High\nconcentrations of heavy metals can be found in and around\nabandoned and active mines due to the discharge and disper-\nsion of mine waste materials into nearby soils, food crops, and\nstream sediments (Lee et al. 2001; Jung 2001; McKenzie and\nPulford 2002; Witte et al. 2004). This will eventually lead to a\nloss of biodiversity, amenity, and economic well being, and a\npotential health risk to residents in the vicinity of the mining\narea may occur (Verner and Ramsey 1996; Lee et al. 2001;\nWong et al. 2002; Gal\u00e1n et al. 2003).\n\nAt present, management of contaminated soils is a major\nissue, which may have serious consequences.

Also, the\nextent and magnitude of the risk posed by such chemicals,\nand what cleanup goals are required for such soils, is a\nmatter of concern.\n\nMetals (and metalloids) such as arsenic (As), cadmi-\num (Cd), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), or mercury (Hg) are\namong the most toxic for humans, especially for chil-\ndren (as well as for animals), and can even lead to\ndeath if ingested in large doses or over large periods\nof time. Exposure to these harmful elements may have\ndifferent pathways, either indirect, through the ingestion\nof vegetables grown in contaminated soils or direct\ningestion of soil (geophagy; Ellickson et al. 2001).\nGeophagy includes dust inhalation and dust ingestion,\nfueled by its adherence to hands and plants, which may\nreach human\u2019s mouth. This issue leads to exposure to\nimmobile or weakly mobile metals that otherwise would\nnot pose any kind of risk to humans or animals.\n\nThese complex sets of processes can be illustrated\nwith the case study of the active Panasqueira mine. The\nPanasqueira hydrothermal mineralization, located geo-\ngraphically in the municipalities of Covilh\u00e3 and\nFund\u00e3o (Castelo Branco district, Central Portugal;\nFig. 1a) is the biggest Sn-W deposit of Western\nEurope and has been in operation since 1896 to the\npresent date (Smith 2006).\n\nThe paragenesis is complex; nevertheless, four stages of\nmineral formation are generally accepted by most of the\nauthors who have studied this deposit: (1) oxide silicate\nphase [quartz, wolframite, and cassiterite]; (2) main sulfide\nphase [pyrite, arsenopyrite, pyrrothite, sphalerite, AND\nchalcopyrite]; (3) pyrrothite alteration phase [marcasite, sid-\nerite, galena, and Pb-Bi-Ag sulphosalts]; (4) late carbonate\nphase [dolomite and calcite] (Breiter 2001; Corr\u00eaa de S\u00e1 et\nal. 1999; Correa and Naique 1998; Noronha et al. 1992;\nCavey and Gunning 2006). At Panasqueira, more than 65\nminerals including sulfides, sulphosalts, oxides, carbonates,\nsilicates, phosphates, and tungstates minerals have been\nidentified (Kelly and Rye 1979).\n\nThe mining and beneficiation processes at the site pro-\nduces metal-rich mine wastes, being Barroca Grande?\n7 Mm3 with two mud dams?1.2 Mm3 (one of these dams\nstill active while the older one is deactivate) one of the main\ndeposits in the mine area. According to \u00c1vila et al. (2008),\nthe rejected materials from the ore processing, containing\nhigh concentrations of metals, are stored in the open-air\nimpoundments. Barroca Grande impoundment shows high\nconcentrations of As, Cd, Cu, and Zn (\u00c1vila et al. 2008; e-\nEcorisk 2007). The unconfined tailings and open impound-\nments are the main source of pollution in the surrounding\narea once the oxidation of sulfides can result in the\n\nmobilization and migration of trace metals from the mining\nwastes into the environment, releasing contaminants into the\necosystem. The effect of Panasqueira mining activities and\nthe metals release from acid mine waters to ground waters\nand stream sediments is dynamic and actual. Soils, down-\nstream Barroca Grande tailing, will be a major repository for\nthe heavy metals released with the S. Francisco de Assis\nvillage the most affected.\n\nIn this paper, the environmental contamination impact\non S. Francisco de Assis (SFA) agricultural and urban\nsoils due to the mining activities is investigated. The\nobjectives of the study are (a) to assess the levels of\nsoil contamination in respect to average concentrations\nof toxic metals in the region, (b) to determine the\nassociations between the different toxic elements and\ntheir spatial distribution, and (c) to identify possible\nsources of contamination that can explain the spatial\npatterns of soil pollution in the SFA.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nField sampling\n\nThe soil sampling collection was established according the\nsite-specific characteristics. In the study area, the soil is\nmostly an incipient and lithic soil derived from a metasedi-\nments substrate (cambisols), and therefore the depth of\nsampling was set to a maximum of 10 cm to guarantee that\nall samples could be collected at the same conditions. A\ntotal of 75 soil samples were collected downstream Barroca\nGrande tailing (SFA1 to SFA75; Fig. 1b and c) in the\nvicinity of SFA. To establish the local geochemical back-\nground, 20 unaffected soil samples (SoBK1 to SoBK20;\nFig. 1b) were also collected outside of the contaminated\narea (Casegas area). All samples have been georeferenced\nto Universal Transverse Mercator coordinates. Soil samples\nwere dried at 40 \u00b0C in an oven, homogenized and sieved\nthrough a&lt;200 mesh screen in order to prepare them for\nchemical analysis.\n\nSample chemical analysis\n\nThe&lt;200 mesh soil fractions were submitted to multiele-\nmental analysis in the S. Mamede de Infesta (LNEG)\naccredited lab. For trace metal analysis, a 0.5 g split was\nleached in hot (95 \u00b0C) aqua regia (HCl-HNO3-H2O) for 1 h.\nAfter dilution to 10 ml with water, the solutions were\nanalyzed for 22 chemical elements by conductive plasma\nemission spectrometry (Ag, As, B, Ba, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu,\nFe, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ni, P, Pb, Sb, V, Y, and Zn ) and X-ray (Sn,\nW). The detection limits were based on three times the\nstandard deviation of a blank reagent that was analyzed\n\nEnviron Sci Pollut Res (2013) 20:7534\u20137549 7535\n\nAuthor's personal copy\n\n\n\nten times. Accuracy and analytical precision were deter-\nmined using analyses of reference materials (SO1, SO2,\nSO3, SO4, FER1, FER2, FER3, FER4 from Canadian\nCentre of Mineral and Energy Technology; PACS-1\nfrom NRS26 CNRC; 2711 from NIST) and duplicate\nsamples in each analytical set. The results were within\nthe 95 % confidence limits of the recommended values\ngiven for this certified material. The relative standard\ndeviation was between 5 and 10 %.\n\nMineralogical studies\n\nThe mineralogical characterization in selected soil samples\nincluded: (1) reflected and light optical microscope identi-\nfication and (2) X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Philips\ndifractometer (model X\u2019Pert). Working conditions were au-\ntomatic divergence slit, Cu K? monochromatic radiation,\ngraphite monochromator, 20 mA and 40 kV. Samples were\nrun at a speed of 0.05\u00b0 2?/min (2\u201370\u00b0).

Reagents were applied sequentially\naccording to their chemical aggressivity. The extractable\nfractions were obtained by extraction with different sol-\nutions: (a) F1\u2014sodium acetate (NaOAc, pH5) for ex-\ntraction of exchangeable cations adsorbed by clay and\nthose soluble in water or in slightly acidic conditions\nand coprecipitated by carbonates (the most labile bond-\ned and therefore the most dangerous and bioavailable\nfor the environment); (b) F2\u2014cold hydroxylamine for\nextracting amorphous Fe oxides and crystalline Mn\noxides (metals bound to Fe and Mn oxides that can\nbe released if conditions change from oxic to anoxic\nstate); (c) F3\u2014hot hydroxylamine for extraction of\namorphous and crystalline Fe oxides and crystalline\nMn oxides; (d) F4\u2014aqua regia, for leach sulfide species\n(metals which may be released under oxidizing condi-\ntions) and clay minerals; (e) F5\u2014four acids digestion\n(or total attack) where metals strongly associated with\ncrystalline structures of minerals (such as the remaining\nsilicates) will be decomposed (they are therefore unlike-\nly to be released).\n\nThe recovery of the sequential extraction procedure\nfor Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sn, W,\nand Zn was calculated (Eq. 1) by comparing the sum of\nthe five fractions from the SCE with the total amount\nobtained after hot mixed acid attack of the same sample\nas follows:\n\nRecovery %\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc F1 \u00fe F2 \u00fe F3 \u00fe F4 \u00fe F5\u00f0 \u00de=total concentration\u00bd ?? 100\n\n\u00f01\u00de\n\nFor all elements, the total of the trace elements in the\ndifferent fractions did not exceed \u00b110 % of the bulk sample\nwhich is accepted as satisfactory (Tessier et al. 1979;\nPickering 1986; Yan et al. 1999).\n\nThe relative extraction ratio (RER) was also calculated\n(Eq. 2) by the ratio between the element concentration\nextracted by the individual leaching (CIL) procedure and\nthe concentration extracted by total attack (CTA; Son and\nJung 2011) as follow:\n\nRelative extraction ratio %\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\u00bc CIL mg kg?1\n? ?\n\n=CTA mg kg?1\n? ?? ?\n\n?100 \u00f02\u00de\n\nData analysis\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) and correspondence\nanalysis (CA) In this study, PCA was performed to decrease\nthe dimension of the space where variables are projected\n(Einax and Soldt 1999; Massart and Kaufman 1983). The\nnumber of significant principal components for interpreta-\ntion was selected on the basis of the Kaiser criterion, which\nconsists of retaining those factors where eigenvalue is\nhigher than 1 (Davis 1986; Manly 1994) and gives rise to\na total of explained variance equal or higher than 70 %.\n\nOnce identified, the contaminant group of elements as-\nsociated with ore exploitation and processing, a complete\ndisjunctive matrix of the data was built classifying each\nsample, for each element according to a set of rules. If a\nsample value is below the average value of local back-\nground (Casegas soils), the sample is considered clean (the\nlabel of the element contains a C). If the sample is above\nliterature guideline values for agriculture purposes, it is\nconsidered to require a sort of remediation/reclamation\n(the label of the element contains an R). On the other hand,\nif sample value is between average local background and\nguideline value, it is considered to be in need of interven-\ntion, i.e., further investigation is required (the label of the\nelement contains an I). Regarding guideline values for\nPortuguese agricultural soils, Ferreira (2004) established\nthe following limits: As=30 mgkg?1, Co=40 mgkg?1, Cu=\n100 mgkg?1, Ni=75 mgkg?1, and Zn=300 mgkg?1. These\nvalues were used as the lower limit of a soil requiring recla-\nmation. For Be (4 mgkg?1), Cd (4 mgkg?1), and Pb (70 mg\nkg?1), the limits used were the ones established by the\nCanadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME;\n1999) guidelines for agriculture soils, even though these limits\ndo not refer specifically to Portuguese soils. Neither Ferreira\n(2004) nor CCME (1999) present guideline values for Y, Sn,\nand W, and so only two categories were established for such\nelements: inferior or superior to average local background (the\nlast case being considered as requiring further investigation).\nThe referred complete disjunctive matrix was then submitted\nto a CA. Since CA allows to project variables and samples in\nthe same factorial space (Greenacre 1984), it is possible to\nextract a hierarchy of samples according to their contamina-\ntion level. PCA and CA analysis were performed using Andad\n(v.7.12) software (Andad 2000).\n\nSpatial estimation In order to produce maps of spatial dis-\ntribution of chemical elements concentrations and contami-\nnation factors, a variographic study followed by ordinary\nkriging (OK) was performed (Goovaerts 1997; Wackernagel\n1998). Variograms were constructed and modeled with\ngeoMS software (geoMS 2000), the estimation, by ordinary\nkriging, was also performed with geoMS software. Maps\nwere produced with ArcGis (v. 9.3) software.\n\nEnviron Sci Pollut Res (2013) 20:7534\u20137549 7537\n\nAuthor's personal copy\n\n\n\nEnrichment index calculation In order to evaluate the degree\nof trace metal contamination in soils, an enrichment index\n(Nishida et al. 1982; Chon et al. 1995; Kim et al. 1998;\nFerreira da Silva E et al. 2005) was computed by averaging\nthe ratios of the element concentration (in milligram per\nkilogram) to the median values of the background samples.\n\nContamination factor and modified degree of contamination\nThis is based on the calculation for each pollutant of a\ncontamination factor (Cf; Hakanson 1980). Cf (Eq. 3) is\nthe ratio obtained by dividing the mean concentration of\neach metal in the soil (Ci) by the baseline or background\nvalue of the specific metal (Cb; Liu et al. 2005):\n\nCf\u00bc Ci=Cb and Cd \u00bc\nX\n\ni?n\n1\u00bc1C\n\ni\nf\n\n? ?\n\u00f03\u00de\n\nCf is defined according to four categories as follows (Liu et\nal. 2005): Cf<1\u2014low contamination factor; 1<Cf&lt;3\u2014\nmoderate contamination factor; 3<Cf&lt;6\u2014considerable\ncontamination factor; Cf>6\u2014very high contamination\nfactor.\n\nAbrahim and Parker (2008) presented a modified and\ngeneralized form of the Hakanson (1980) equation for the\ncalculation of the overall degree of contamination as below\n(Eq. 4).\n\nmCd \u00bc\nX\n\ni\u00bcn\n1\u00bc1C\n\ni\nf\n\n? ?\n=n \u00f04\u00de\n\nwhere:n=number of analyzed elements and i=ith element\n(or pollutant) and Cf=contamination factor.\n\nFor the classification and description of the modified de-\ngree of contamination (mCd) in soil, the following gradations\nare proposed: mCd<1.5\u2014nil to very low degree of contami-\nnation; 1.5<mCd<2\u2014low degree of contamination; 2<mCd\n<4\u2014moderate degree of contamination; 4<mCd<8\u2014high\ndegree of contamination; 8<mCd<16\u2014very high degree of\ncontamination; 16<mCd<32\u2014extremely high degree of con-\ntamination; mCd>32\u2014ultrahigh degree of contamination\n(Abrahim and Parker 2008).\n\nResults and discussion\n\nBasic statistical analysis\n\nDescriptive statistics for the aqua regia extracted fraction of\nAg, As, B, Ba, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ni, P,\nPb, Sb, Sn, V, W, Y, and Zn for both SFA and Casegas soils\nare given in Table 1. According to the results, it can be\nnoticed that SFA shows higher mean values for As, Ag, As,\nB, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, P, Sn, W, Y, and Zn when\ncompared to Casegas values (Table 1).\n\nComparing the results for both areas, there are some\nelements that stand out due to differences in its contents.\nThe maximum value of As is 24 times bigger in SFA soils\nthan in Casegas soil samples. The same occurs for other\nelements, such as: Cd (16.5\u00d7), Co (16.9\u00d7), Cu (14\u00d7), Mn\n(37.5\u00d7), Sn (15\u00d7), and W (42\u00d7). Soil samples of SFA are\nenriched with As, Cd, Cu, Mn, and Zn by comparison to\nreference values for world unpolluted soils (Table 1), while\nCasegas soils contain low concentrations of As, Cu, Mn, Pb,\nSb, and Zn. According to Reimann and De Caritat (1998)\nand Deschamps et al. (2002), As, Cd, Cu, and Zn mean\nconcentrations in world unpolluted top soils are 5, 0.3, 25,\nand 70 mgkg?1, respectively, while the respective mean\nvalues for soils of the SFA are 118, 2.2, 122, and 388 mg\nkg?1. Also, the same elements exceed the mean values\nproposed for Portuguese soils (MPS, Table 1), the values\nproposed for cambisols (Table 1) and podzols (Table 1;\nFerreira 2004).\n\nPCA analysis and geochemical interpretation\n\nA matrix of 95 (samples)\u00d722 (chemical elements) was\nsubmitted to a PCA giving rise to the extraction of six\nprincipal components which explains 84.81 % of the total\nvariance (Table 2). The first two factorial planes (Fig. 2)\naccount for 67.13 % of total variance and explain all varia-\nbles with exception of P, associated with the negative PC4\n(?0.6166, loading value; see Table 2) and Mo, associated\nwith the positive semi-axis 6 (0.5810, loading value; see\nTable 2).\n\nThe plot of the PCA results (Fig. 2) show the position of\nthe selected 22 variables coordinates, representing the cor-\nrelation coefficients between them in the different factorial\nplans. Four groups of variables can be identified in the two\nmost important factorial plans.\n\nThe first factorial plan (PC1/PC2) contains 57.63 % of the\nglobal information of the dataset. The PC1, which explains\n43.38 % (Table 2) of the total variance is associated to Cu, Y,\nCo, Mn, Cd, As, Zn, Ni, Be, W, Sn, and Pb (group A).\nCorrelation coefficients values indicate strong association of\nthe following pairs: As\u2013W (r=0.83, p<0.05), As\u2013Cu (r=0.84,\np<0.05), Co\u2013Fe (r=0.86, p<0.05), Co\u2013Ni (r=0.88, p<0.05),\nCu\u2013W (r=0.80, p<0.05) and Sn\u2013W (r=0.80, p<0.05), and\nalso Co\u2013Zn, As\u2013Cd, and Ni\u2013Zn (r=<0.8, p<0.05).\n\nIn group A, two subsets of associations are revealed: (a)\none with negative loadings in PC1 and positive loadings in\nPC2 (A1\u2014As, Sn, W, Cu, and Y) which seems to be\ncontrolled by the mixed sulfide mineralization since all the\nelements summarized by this factor are characteristic of the\nsulfide

(Fe,Mn)WO4), pyrite (FeS2), pyrrhotite (Fe(1?\u00d7)S\n(\u00d7=0\u20130.2)), arsenopyrite (FeAsS), chalcopyrite (CuFeS2),\ncassiterite (SnO2), beryl (Be3Al2(Si6O18), mica, and fluorite\n(CaF2)) still maintain a close relationship in the secondary\nenvironment. The association As, Sn, and W represents the\noxide\u2013silicate mineral formation phase (quartz, wolframite,\nand cassiterite), while the associations Cu and Y, and Be,\nCd, Co, Mn, Pb, Zn represents the main sulfide phase (pyrite,\narsenopyrite, pyrrothite, sphalerite ((Zn,Fe)S), and chalcopy-\nrite) and the pyrrothite alteration phase [marcasite (FeS2),\nsiderite (FeCO3), galena (PbS), and Pb-Bi-Ag sulphosalts].\n\nThese associations reflect the strong influence of the Rio\nand Barroca tailings and mud dams. According to \u00c1vila et\nal. (2008), the Rio tailings samples contain scorodite\n(FeAsO4\u00b72H2O), sphalerite, wolframite, quartz, natrojaro-\nsite (NaFe3+3(SO4)2(OH)6), montmorilonite ((Mg,\nCa)O.Al2O3Si5O10.nH2O), vermiculite((Mg,Fe,Al)3(Al,\nSi)4O10(OH)2.4H2O), ilite, some silicates like kaolinite\n(Al2Si2O5(OH)4), and also sulfate minerals. In contrast, in\nthe Rio tailings dam, melanterite (Fe2+(SO4).7(H2O)) and\nminor amounts of rozenite (Fe2+(SO4).4(H2O)) and szomol-\nnokite (Fe2+(SO4).(H2O)) are present. The Rio dam consists\npredominantly of quartz, mica, feldspar, illite\u2013vermiculite,\narsenopyrite, marcasite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite.\nOther minerals, like scorodite and natrojarosite, are also\npresent. The DRX analysis of the active dam sample of\nBarroca Grande revealed the presence of scorodite, arseno-\npyrite, quartz, sphalerite, heamatite (Fe2O3), and muscovite\n(KAl2(AlSi3O10)(F,OH)2) while the sample from the old\ndam of Barroca Grande contained quartz, pyrite, chalcopy-\nrite, wolframite (ferberite), and scorodite (\u00c1vila et al. 2008).\nThe samples collected in the tailing materials of Barroca\nGrande consist predominantly of arsenopyrite, wolframite\n(ferberite), quartz, and muscovite.\n\nThe PC2, which explains 14.25 % of the total vari-\nance, is related with two groups (group B, associated to\nthe negative scores\u2014Fe-Ba and Nb-V; group C, associa-\nted with the positive scores\u2014Cr). PC2 can be associated\nwith the dominant lithological unit (brown argilaceous\nschists and dark gray siliceous schist interbedded with\nrare greywackes). Few mafic rocks (dolerites) were\n\nobserved, particularly near S. Jorge da Beira (NW\u2013SE\nsubvertical).\n\nThe second factorial plan (PC1/PC3, representing\n52.88 % of total variance) is dominated by the association\nof Sb, Ag, and B variables (group D). This plan separates\nthe main sulfide minerals phases from the sulphosalts.\n\nLevel of soil pollution and environmental quality\n\nA simplified approach to risk assessment was adopted in\nthis study by comparing the measured level of soil contam-\nination in SFA with local geochemical background values\n(Table 1). PCA results show that As, Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni,\nSn, Y, W, and Zn were the elements of most concern.\nTable 3 shows the results of Cf and the mCd.\n\nAccording to the results, the highest Cf values are\nrecorded for As and Zn (median>6.0), while considerable\nCf values (3<median&lt;6) occur in Cu, Mn, Y, and Sn. The\ncalculated mCf values range from 1.1 to 26.4 with an aver-\nage of 4.0. The cumulative frequency distribution shows\nthat only 34.6 % of the soil samples were classified as nil\nto very low degree of pollution with mCd values 2.0, while\nthe remaining 65.4 % exhibit moderate to high degree of\npollution (mCd>2.0). Samples SFA 3 and SFA18 show the\nhighest mCd values (26.4 and 25.8, respectively). As\nexpected, the Casegas soils are not contaminated or show\nevidences of low contamination (mCd=1.1).\n\nIn order to assess the spatial distribution of these Cf,\nexperimental variograms were calculated and modeled\n(Table 4). All variograms, modeled by spherical schemes,\nshow that the nugget effect (C0) is zero.\n\nEstimation of the spatial distribution of As and Cu was\nthen achieved by OK. The spatial distribution of As (Fig. 3)\nreveals zones with very high values. Comparison of the SFA\ndata with the MPS values (11 mgkg?1; Table 1) and with the\nguidelines for agriculture soils in Portugal (30 mgkg?1;\nTable 1), reveals that 98.6 and 96.3 % are above these\nvalues. The mapping of Cf of As highlights that 84.2 % of\nthe study area is classified as high to extremely high\ncontaminated.\n\nThe Cu spatial distribution (Fig. 4) also identify high\nconcentrations in the study area.

Also, the W concentrations\nare higher than 83 mgkg?1.\n\nThese high values are probably related to mechanical\ndispersion of tailing materials as a result of erosion.\nHowever, it must be stressed that other mechanisms also\ncontribute to the secondary dispersion of these metals, such\nas: (a) precipitation of hydroxide, oxyhydroxide, or hydrox-\nysulphate phases from aqueous species as pH increases; and\n(b) sorption of metals onto neoformed mineral surfaces\n(carbonates or Fe and Mn coatings, for example), according\nto Nordstrom (1982) and Chapman et al. (1983).\n\nCA analysis and mapping\n\nThe first factorial plane of CA explains approximately 44 %\nof total inertia of the data. Figure 6a shows that the sequence\n\nof ordinal variables follows the axis 1. In fact, lower mo-\ndalities (considered clean) project onto the negative semi-\naxis, while greater modalities (requiring reclamation) proj-\nect onto the positive semi-axis. The modalities are disposed\nin a parabolic shape (Fig. 6a), showing a clear distribution\nalong the first axis\u2014Guttman effect. Hence, modalities are\nsequenced in an ascending way along this axis, from clean\nto requiring reclamation passing through the area of the\ngraph where samples requiring further investigation are\nproject. Asymptotically, this axis can be considered as a\nproxy of an index of the sample contamination gradient.\n\nFigure 6b presented the projection of the samples in the\nsame factorial plane of Fig. 6a. Samples show the same\ndistribution of modalities along the first axis, allowing iden-\ntifying which samples are associated with each one of the\nvariable categories.\n\nFig. 6 a Graphical\nrepresentation of modalities\nprojection into the first factorial\nplane of CA, b graphical\nrepresentation of samples\nprojection into the first factorial\nplane of CA\n\nEnviron Sci Pollut Res (2013) 20:7534\u20137549 7545\n\nAuthor's personal copy\n\n\n\nIn a region where agriculture and cattle breading is, after\nmining, the principal economic activity, it is imperative to\ncross-reference the contaminant potential and harmful effect\nof soils with land use. Figure 7 reveals that samples in need\nof intervention and reclamation are disposed preferentially\nin urban and agriculture areas. This fuels the need to per-\nform availability studies in the most pernicious elements in\nwhat human health is concerned.\n\nPartitioning of metals in selected samples\n\nThe mineralogical study of the two selected soil samples\n(SFA3 and SFA18\u2014selected according their position in the\nprojection into the first factorial plane of CA; Fig. 6b) by\nXRD showed that they are composed mainly of quartz,\nplagioclase, and phylossilicates (biotite, chlorite, muscovite,\nillite, and kaolinite). However, some iron oxides (haematite,\ngoethite, and magnetite/maghemite) and As (arsenopyrite),\nFe (pyrite), Cu (chalcopyrite), Pb (galena), and Zn sulfides\n(sphalerite) are also present. Iron and Al sulfates (jarosite,\nKFe3+3(OH)6(SO4)2; alunite, KAl3(SO4)2(OH)6) and Fe,\nCu, and Pb sulfates and carbonates (siderite, anglesite, mala-\nchite, cerusite) are also present. In some samples, plumbu-\ngummite (PbAl3(PO4)2(OH)5.H2O), anidrite (CaSO4),\ngypsum (CaSO4.2H2O), and halite (NaCl) are also present.\n\nUsing SCE, it was possible to estimate the distribution of\nAg, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, W, and Zn\namong the geochemical fractions on selected soil samples\n(SFA3 and SFA18), accounting for the relative proportions\nof each trace metal transported by the mechanical and\nchemical agents. Table 6 shows the geochemical partitio-\nning of some selected elements in those fractions of each\nsample.\n\nIron is mostly extracted by F4 in the selected soil samples\n(percent of extraction ranging from 39.2 to 69.3 %), sug-\ngesting the presence of sulfides. However, considerable\nproportion of this metal (up to 50 % in sample SFA3) seems\n\nto be also associated to the remaining silicates. It must be\npointed out that the percentage of extraction associated to\namorphous and crystalline Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides ranges\nbetween 8.3 and 9.4 %.\n\nSimilar results for As distribution patterns were obtained\nfor the selected soil samples (Table 6). Arsenic seems to be\nlinked to sulfides, since a considerable proportion is\nextracted by aqua regia (F4\u201466.7 to 68.4 %). This high\npercentage associated with sulfides reflects the presence of\narsenopyrite in the samples. Amorphous and crystalline Fe\nand Mn oxyhydroxides (F3) seems to be also important\nmetal-bearing phases. The percentage of easily mobilized\nphases is very low (0.04\u20130.05 %); however, As concentra-\ntions associated with this extraction values (0.4\u20130.7 mg\nkg?1) may be considered very high.\n\nSilver, Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn show high (and\nsimilar) partitioning patterns in the SFA3 and SFA18 sam-\nples (47.7\u201354.5, 64.8\u201374.4, 73.4\u201380.6, 49.5\u201354.9, 74.4\u2013\n90.6, 42.4\u201365.9, 46.2\u201356.3, and 51\u201381.1 % of extraction\nby hydroxylamine leach cold, respectively), suggesting that\nthese may be linked, to some extent, to amorphous Fe/Mn\noxyhydroxides. Moreover, part of these elements was\nextracted with aqua regia in both samples, suggesting that\nthese elements may also be linked, to some extent, to sulfide\nor clay minerals. It was also shown that Cd (10.3\u201313.9 % of\nextraction, 1.9\u20134 mgkg?1 for Cd) and Zn (1.0\u20132.8 % of\nextraction, 10\u201374 mgkg?1 for Zn) were also extracted to a\ngreat extent with sodium acetate indicating that the solu-\nble/exchangeable/carbonate fraction is probably a preferen-\ntial sink for Cd and Zn.\n\nThese SCE results show that the most pollutant fraction\nin these soil samples consists of metals bounded to sulfides\n(such as arsenopyrite, pyrrothite, and chalcopyrite) and re-\nleased under oxidizing conditions in AMD production pro-\ncesses. Part of this fraction, especially for As, Cd, Cu, and\nZn, is temporally retained in solid phases by precipitation of\nsoluble secondary minerals (precipitation of hydrated metal\n\nFig. 7 Sample

In contrast, such minerals are\neasily dissolved in rainy periods.\n\nThe highest percentage of Sn extraction is related to the\nlast step of extraction in samples SFA3 and SFA18. These\nphases are highly resistant to both chemical and physical\nweathering and can be transported long distances from the\nsource areas. According to Rose et al. (1979), the mobility\nof Sn in natural environments is dependent on low and high\npH. Weathering induces the transport of natural and anthro-\npogenic Sn under acidic and reducing conditions, SnS2 is\ninsoluble under reducing conditions (Brookins 1988).\n\nThese SCE results suggest that local wind and hydrolog-\nical factors give rise to mechanisms of transport responsible\nfor the dispersion of elements. The mechanical dispersion\nfuelled by the wind of hydrated metal sulfates, resulting\nfrom evaporation during warm period and stored in the\nopen-air impoundments from Barroca Grande and Rio,\ninduces the accumulation of these materials on solid materi-\nals such as soil. Also, these elements could be transported in\nsuspension by surface waters or by acidic waters draining a\nnumber of sites, contaminating the soils with As and sulfide-\nrelated heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, and Cd).\n\nConclusions\n\nThe mining and processing activities at Panasqueira mine\nproduces arsenic-rich mine wastes that are largely responsi-\nble for the high levels of metals at the Barroca Grande and\nRio tailings. Oxidation of sulfides may give rise to the\nmobilization and migration of trace metals from the mining\nwastes into the environment, releasing the contaminants to\nthe ecosystems. The above referred As-rich mine wastes are\nthe main source of pollution in the surrounding environ-\nment, namely in SFA soils.\n\nThe integrated procedure using PCA and CA allowed the\nauthors to identify the contaminant group of elements associ-\nated to mining activities (As, Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Sn, Y, W,\nand Zn were the elements of most concern) and the identifi-\ncation of sites that require intervention or remediation.\n\nOn other hand, it was possible to identify the elements that\nare responsible for the high degree of contamination and\nclassify the quality of the local soil based on the estimation\nof the modified degree of contamination. According to the\nresults obtained through a contamination factor determination,\nAs and Zn are the variables that present very high contamina-\ntion factors, leading to the fact that 65.4 % of the S. Francisco\nde Assis soil samples exhibit a moderate to high degree of\npollution, and only 34.6 % of the samples were classified as\nnil to very low degree of pollution. The spatial distribution of\nthis contamination factor shows that soils collected down-\nstream Barroca Grande contain elements like As, Cd, Cu,\nPb, and Zn, which occur in increased concentrations, when\n\ncompared with local Bk soils. The mechanical dispersion, due\nto erosion, is the main factor fuelling this phenomenon. The\npractical results of this study allow selecting areas where an\neventual remediation procedure may be foreseen. Priority\nshould be given to areas where samples are classified as\nrequiring reclamation, when they are geographically located\nin agricultural or urban areas.\n\nAn approach based on chemical sequential extraction\ndemonstrates that the distribution/accumulation of trace\nmetals in the SFA soils is, to a great extent, related to\nsulfides, but also to amorphous or poorly crystalline iron\noxide geochemical phases. However, it was also noticed that\na significant proportion of the As, Cd, Cu, and Zn is linked\nto exchangeable and acid-soluble species, upon which de-\nsorption and ion exchange reactions may originate the re-\nlease of these readily mobile phases. These results disclose\nthe fact that the wind and hydrological factors are fuelling\nthe chemical elements transport mechanisms. Such factors\nare likely to be responsible for dispersion of the above\nreferred elements, water being the main transporter medium\nand soils as one of the possible retention media.\n\nAcknowledgments This research was funded by the European Com-\nmission through the e-Ecorisk Project (# EVG1-2002-25 0068) \u201cA re-\ngional enterprise network decision-support system for environmental risk\nand disaster management of large-scale industrial spills\u201d.

A\n\nmatched control group (N = 40) was also studied, and\n\ndata from the three groups were compared. Results\n\nobtained agreed with those reported by environmental\n\nstudies performed in this area, pointing to populations\n\nliving nearby and working in the mine being exposed\n\nto metal(loid)s originated from mining activities.\n\nArsenic was the element with the highest increase in\n\nexposed populations. The concentration of other\n\nelements such as Cr, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, S, Se, and\n\nZn was also increased, although at a lesser extent,\n\nspecifically in the individuals environmentally\n\nexposed and in females. These findings confirm the\n\nneed for competent authorities to act as soon as\n\npossible in this area and implement strategies aimed to\n\nprotect exposed populations and the entire ecosystem.\n\nKeywords Environmental contamination ?\nHuman exposure ?

It is also one of the most hazardous activities\n\nboth in occupational and environmental contexts.\n\nThe remarkable increase in exposure to metal(loid)s\n\nin several environmental and occupational settings\n\nrepresents a worldwide pattern, affecting a significant\n\nnumber of individuals. Most metal(loid)s have toxic\n\nproperties and can represent an important threat for\n\nhuman health. Major health effects include develop-\n\nment retardation, endocrine disruption, kidney damage,\n\nimmunological and neurologic effects, and several\n\ntypes of cancer (Mudgal et al. 2010).\n\nHuman health status can be monitored by measur-\n\ning biological indicators (biomarkers), in different\n\nmatrices, such as blood, urine, nails, hair, milk, and\n\nsaliva. This activity of biological monitoring has the\n\nmain purpose of relating the biomarker concentration\n\nto the internal dose and then investigates the possibil-\n\nity that the extent of exposure is associated with\n\ndisease occurrence (Needham et al. 2007).\n\nFor decades, scientists have analysed biological\n\nsamples such as liver, kidney, brain, blood, and urine\n\nto assess concentrations of trace elements in the human\n\nbody (Mehra and Juneja 2005). Information on the\n\nelemental content of these samples is well established,\n\nalthough most of them need an invasive method for\n\ncollection that may limit their use in biomonitoring\n\nstudies. Hair and nail samples provide a much less\n\ninvasive option and offer a number of advantages,\n\nincluding the easy sample collection, storage, and\n\ntransportation; possible time course of exposure; the\n\nlong-term sample stability; and the simple analysis using\n\ninductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-\n\nMS) and inductively coupled plasma optical spectrom-\n\netry (ICP-OES) (He 2011). These techniques are the\n\nmost commonly performed, and they are routinely used\n\nfor multielemental analysis of biological matrices\n\n(Delves 1988; Caroli et al. 1992; Taylor et al. 2011).\n\nHair and nails incorporate elements in proportion to\n\nthe dietary intakes and exogenous exposure depending\n\nupon various mechanisms, such as protein synthesis\n\nand chemical binding with sulfhydryl groups. These\n\nbiological matrixes are useful to investigate exposure\n\nto trace elements and are currently employed in\n\nclinical studies with increasing frequency. As\n\nsuggested by Rodushkin and Axelsson (2000), human\n\nhair and nails in trace elements analysis may provide\n\nsuitable data that point towards diseases such as\n\ndiabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and other\n\ncardiovascular diseases.\n\nPanasqueira (40?905700N, 7?4503700W) was studied\nbetween 2002 and 2007 in the scope of an e-EcoRisk\n\nproject (e-Ecorisk 2001, 2007). This area was chosen\n\nby the consortium to be an e-EcoRisk test site due to\n\nseveral factors: (a) it is an active mine; (b) there are\n\nhuge tailing piles and mud impoundments; (c) small\n\nvillages, S. Jorge da Beira, Panasqueira, Barroca\n\nGrande, and S. Francisco de Assis are located near the\n\nmine site; (d) the Ze?zere River crosses the area and\n\nfeeds the Castelo do Bode dam (located 90 km\n\ndownstream), the main water supply source for\n\nLisbon; and (e) the local population strongly depends\n\non the use of land and water for their subsistence\n\n(water supply, agriculture, cattle breeding, fishing, and\n\nforestry). From the geochemical results obtained in\n\nthis project, it was concluded that anomalous distri-\n\nbution of several metals (Ag, Bi, Cu, Cd, Sb, Sn, W,\n\nand Zn) and metalloids (As) in stream sediments and\n\nsurface waters from local water streams, and soils\n\nfrom nearby villages occurs (A?vila et al. 2008;\n\nSalgueiro et al. 2008; Grangeia et al. 2011). Starting\n\nfrom 2010, the Department of Geosciences, University\n\nof Aveiro (GeoBioTec) together with the National\n\nLaboratory of Energy and Geology (LNEG) have been\n\ncollecting and analysing different types of samples,\n\nsuch as road dusts, soils, plants for human consump-\n\ntion, superficial and groundwater\u2019s, and stream sedi-\n\nments. Results published by Ferreira da Silva et al.\n\n(2013) agree with those from the previous study\n\nreporting extremely high concentrations of metals and\n\nmetalloids in all these matrices. According to the\n\nresults, the wind and hydrological factors are respon-\n\nsible for the chemical elements transport mechanisms,\n\nthe water being the main transporter medium and soils\n\nas one of the possible retention media (Ferreira da\n\nSilva et al. 2013).\n\nThe aim of the present study was to evaluate\n\nwhether the contamination (environmental and occu-\n\npational) related to Panasqueira mine activities is\n\nassociated with the internal dose of several elements\n\nby quantifying them in blood, urine, hair, and nails by\n\nICP-MS (As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Mn, No, Ni, Pb, and Se) and\n\nby ICP-OES (Cu, Fe, Mg, S, Si, and Zn).\n\nEnviron Geochem Health\n\n123\n\nAuthor's personal copy\n\n\n\nStudy Area\n\nThe Panasqueira mine (Sn-W) is located in Castelo\n\nBranco district, central Portugal\u2014Fig. 1.\n\nThe topography of this area is heterogeneous,\n\ncharacterized by deep valleys and hills ranging from\n\n350 to 1,080 m in altitude (Reis 1971). Streams are\n\ngenerally dry in summer and flooded in winter.\n\nAlthough historical data show that Romans worked\n\nthe area for tin (Sn), the first prospecting licence was\n\ngranted in 1886 (Cavey and Gunning 2006). The\n\nPanasqueira mining concession covers an area of more\n\nthan 2,000 ha and since 1928 has been running by\n\nBeralt Tin and Wolfram Lda (Corre?a de Sa? et al. 1999;\n\nD\u2019Orey 1967).\n\nThe ore complex paragenesis of Panasqueira contains\n\nseveral minerals, which the most important are wol-\n\nframite, cassiterite, pyrite, arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite,\n\nsphalerite, chalcopyrite, marcasite, siderite, galena,\n\nPb\u2013Bi\u2013Ag sulphosalts, dolomite, calcite, and siderite.\n\nUntil 1996\u2014for approximately 90 years\u2014the rejected\n\nmaterials were deposited in the Rio tailing and/or in the\n\nopen-air impoundment located in the vicinity of Rio\n\ntailing (Fig. 2). The open-air impoundment contains\n\n731,034 m\n3\n\nof rejected ore concentrates with high metal\n\nlevels. This rejected material is exposed to the atmo-\n\nsphere and rain water, and the oxidized material\n\ngenerates acidic mine drainage (AMD). Also there are\n\nseveral slippage zones evident in the Rio tailings,\n\nindicating a risk of collapse. In this scenario, the stocked\n\nmaterial will enter directly into the Ze?zere River (e-\n\nEcoRisk 2007). As previously mentioned Ze?zere River\n\nfeeds the Castelo do Bode dam (located 90 km down-\n\nstream from the mine\u2014Fig. 1), the principal water\n\nsupply for the Lisbon metropolitan area (where about\n\none-third of the Portuguese population lives).\n\nToday the mining and beneficiation processes are\n\ncarried out exclusively in Barroca Grande. The\n\nrejected materials are deposited in the Barroca Grande\n\ntailing and/or in the open-air impoundment.\n\nFig. 1 Location of Panasqueira mine (arrow on the left map), the Castelo do Bode dam, the Ze?zere river flow (line across the map on\nthe right), and the city of Lisbon (Lisboa, circle)\n\nEnviron Geochem Health\n\n123\n\nAuthor's personal copy\n\n\n\nThe Barroca Grande site includes a huge tail-\n\ning ([7 Mm3) and two open-air impoundments\n(*1,2 Mm3\u2014one of these dams still active while the\nolder one is deactivated, both placed over the tailing).\n\nThese tailings and impoundments are also exposed to\n\nthe atmospheric conditions, and surface run-off and\n\nwater percolation leaching are observed. The tailing\n\npiles at Barroca Grande are adjacent to the small, but\n\nperennially flowing, Casinhas stream, which drains\n\nalso to the Ze?zere River. The Salgueira water treatment\n\nplant receives surface water from the old tailing pond\n\narea, water from the new tailings pond, mine drainage\n\nwater, and seepage from the base of the tailings. These\n\nwaters are mainly treated with lime. The precipitated\n\nsludge is pumped to the tailings pond while the treated\n\nwater is pumped into holding tanks for later use in the\n\nmill or released to the creek channel adjacent to the\n\nplant and discharged into the Ze?zere River.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nStudy population\n\nThe study population consisted of a total of 122\n\nsubjects living in villages near the Panasqueira mine,\n\nin central Portugal (Fig. 2).\n\nThe study population consisted of a total of 122\n\nsubjects living in the area of the Panasqueira mine.\n\nForty-one individuals living in villages located in the\n\nvicinity of the mine were classified as environmentally\n\nexposed (16 males and 25 females), 41 male workers\n\nfrom the Panasqueira mine represented the group of\n\noccupationally exposed, and 40 additional subjects\n\nwithout environmental and/or occupational exposure\n\nto mining activities, or other known toxic exposure,\n\nwere the controls. This latter group included individ-\n\nuals living in non-contaminated areas, working mainly\n\nin administrative offices and matched with the envi-\n\nronmentally exposed group by age, gender, lifestyle,\n\nand smoking habits (17 males and 23 females). Only\n\nindividuals aged over 18 years and living in the same\n\nvillage for at least 5 years before the study were\n\nselected.\n\nHealth conditions, medical history, medication,\n\ndiagnostic tests (X-rays, etc.), and lifestyle factors\n\nwere assessed by means of questionnaires. Subjects\n\nalso provided information about the presence of\n\nspecific symptoms related to metal(loid)s exposure\n\nand chronic respiratory diseases, such as bronchitis\n\nand others; drinking and agricultural water source;\n\nagricultural practices, including pesticides usage; diet.\n\nAll subjects were fully informed about the procedures\n\nFig. 2 Map showing the location of the 4 study villages: 2\nexposed in rectangles (S. Francisco de Assis and Barroca do\n\nZe?zere) and 2 control in circles (Casegas and Unhais-o-Velho).\n\nIn squares are the main sources of contamination: the active\n\ntailing\u2014Barroca Grande and the old one\u2014Rio tailing. The\n\ncurrent location of the mine is also shown inside the Barroca\n\nGrande square.

Approval for this study was obtained\n\nfrom the Institutional Ethical Board of the Portuguese\n\nNational Institute of Health.\n\nThe general characteristics of the study groups are\n\nsummarized in Table 1. Smoking habits groups were\n\nestablished as never/ever smokers, with the former\n\ngroup composed of individuals that never smoked and\n\nthe second one of current and ex-smokers. This was\n\ndue to the fact that the number of ex-smokers was\n\nextremely high, and the majority of these individuals\n\nhad been heavy smokers.\n\nSample collection\n\nBlood (B) samples were collected by venipuncture in\n\ntubes containing ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid\n\n(EDTA). First morning, urine (U) samples (minimum\n\nvolume: 20 ml) were collected in polyethylene sterile\n\nbottles. Hair (H) and nail (finger, FN, and toe, TN)\n\nsamples were collected with stainless steel scissors\n\nand nail clippers and stored in polyethylene bags.\n\nSamples were transported under refrigeration and kept\n\nat approximately ?4 ?C (blood) and \u201320 ?C (urine,\nhair, and nails) until analysis. All samples were coded\n\nand analysed under blind conditions.\n\nSample preparation and analysis\n\nBlood samples (1\u20132 g) were added to 2 mL of HNO3\nin Teflon vials and digested for 24 h at 100 ?C. After\ncooling, the digested solutions were diluted with\n\ndeionized water up to 10 mL in polypropylene tubes\n\nfor elemental analysis by ICP-MS and ICP-OES. For\n\nanalysis of blood samples, In and Sc were the chemical\n\nelements used as internal standards, while Ge and Ir\n\nwere used for urine, hair, and nail samples.\n\nHair and nail samples were washed and digested\n\nfollowing the procedures described by Coelho et al.\n\n(2012). The solutions were transferred to plastic tubes\n\nand made up to 5 mL with ultra-pure water for direct\n\ndetermination via ICP-MS and ICP-OES. The ICP-MS\n\ninstruments used in this study were a PerkinElmer\n\nElan DRC II and a Thermo Elemental X Series.\n\nTable 1 Characteristics of\nthe study population:\n\nbaseline comparison\n\nbetween controls and\n\nexposed groups by\n\ndemographics and lifestyle\n\nfactors\n\nStatistically significant\n\nresults are highlighted in\n\nbold\na\n\nMean \u00b1 standard\n\ndeviation;\nb\n\nChi-square test;\nc\n\nANOVA test\n\nTotal of subjects Controls Environmentally\n\nexposed\n\nOccupationally\n\nexposed\n\nP value\n\n40 41 41\n\nGender\n\nMales 17 (43 %) 16 (39 %) 41 (100 %)&lt;0.001\nb\n\nFemales 23 (59 %) 25 (61 %) 0 (0 %)\n\nAge (years)\na\n\n56.60 \u00b1 12.58 61.71 \u00b1 13.50 62.05 \u00b1 7.57 0.063\nc\n\nSmoking habits\n\nNever smokers 25 (62 %) 32 (78 %) 16 (39 %) 0.001b\n\nEver smokers 15 (38 %) 9 (22 %) 25 (61 %)\n\nWater consumption\n\nBottled water 2 (5 %) 3 (7 %) 4 (10 %) 0.714\nb\n\nTap water 20 (51 %) 23 (56 %) 17 (41 %)\n\nSpring water 17 (44 %) 15 (37 %) 20 (49 %)\n\nFish consumption\n\n0\u20132 portions/week 19 (47 %) 25 (61 %) 23 (56 %) 0.541\nb\n\n[2 portions/week 20 (53 %) 16 (39 %) 18 (44 %)\nAgriculture\n\nNo 6 (15 %) 14 (34 %) 1 (2 %) 0.001\nb\n\nYes 34 (85 %) 27 (66 %) 40 (98 %)\n\nPesticide usage (last\n\nyear)\n\nNo 10 (26 %) 16 (39 %) 11 (28 %) 0.408\nb\n\nYes 28 (74 %) 25 (61 %) 29 (72 %)\n\nEnviron Geochem Health\n\n123\n\nAuthor's personal copy\n\n\n\nA PerkinElmer Optima 5300 and a Thermo Scientific\n\niCAP 6300 Duo were used for ICP-OES analysis. For\n\nmicrowave digestion, an Anton Paar Multiwave 3000\n\noven, equipped with 16 vessels, was used.\n\nUrine samples were defrosted 24 h before the\n\nanalysis, centrifuged for 3 min at 2,500 rpm, and\n\ndiluted up to 25-fold with 1 % v/v HNO3 for\n\nelemental analysis by ICP-MS and ICP-OES. Results\n\nof urine samples were adjusted, and they are reported\n\nas lg/g creatinine. This procedure (creatinine adjust-\nment) is routinely used to reduce the influence of\n\nfactors that are not related to metal(loid) exposure,\n\nsuch as urine concentration and urine volume (Hin-\n\nwood et al. 2002). Creatinine was measured spectro-\n\nphotometrically using the Jaffe reaction (Roche\n\nDiagnostics).\n\nAll reagents used were trace analysis grade or better\n\nquality. All aqueous solutions were prepared using\n\nultra-pure water.\n\nQuality control and quality assurance\n\nBlood analyses were validated using European Union,\n\nInstitute for Reference Materials and Measurements\u2014\n\nCertified Reference Materials (CRMs): BCR\n?\n\n634,\n\nBCR\n?\n\n635, and BCR\n?\n\n636. Freeze-dried human urine\n\nCRM from National Institute of Environmental Stud-\n\nies (NIES), Japan, was used in addition to validating\n\nthe metal(loid) quantification in urine samples. This\n\nmaterial was also analysed during each analytical run\n\nas a quality control (QC) sample. As no nail CRM is\n\ncurrently available, the methods for digestion and\n\nanalysis of hair, fingernail, and toenail samples were\n\nvalidated using a human hair CRM\u2014NCS DC 73347a\n\nand NCS ZC 81002b human hair (NCS Beijing,\n\nChina). The CRMs were also used as QC items by\n\ndigesting a portion with each batch of samples and\n\ndetermining the metal(loid) concentration along with\n\nthe other digests. Other QC measures used in the\n\ndifferent matrices included the periodic analysis of\n\nsuitable standards to check on instrument drift and\n\nshort-term stability. Results from all the CRMs were\n\nwithin their certificated ranges.\n\nStatistical data analysis\n\nA general description of the study population was\n\nperformed through univariate analysis. The distribu-\n\ntion within the three study groups of gender, age, and\n\nlifestyle factors potentially influencing the concentra-\n\ntion of metal(loid)s in the biological samples (i.e.\n\nsmoking habits, source of drinking water, fish con-\n\nsumption, agricultural practices, and pesticide use)\n\nwas evaluated with the chi-square test for categorical\n\nvariables and with the analysis of variance (ANOVA)\n\nfor continuous variables.\n\nThe effect of exposure on the concentration of\n\nmetal(loid)s was preliminarily tested with the ANOVA\n\nof log-transformed data. A multiple regression analysis\n\nwas performed to estimate the effect of the exposure,\n\nadjusted for actual confounders. All models included\n\nage and smoking habits. Three multiple regression\n\nmodels were applied for the multivariate analysis,\n\ndepending on the characteristics and statistical distri-\n\nbution of variables.

Significant\n\ndifferences were also found for the frequency of\n\nindividuals reporting their involvement in agricultural\n\npractice, while no significant differences were found\n\nfor the source of drinking water, quantity of fish\n\nconsumed, and pesticide use in the last year.\n\nResults of metal(loid) quantification showed sig-\n\nnificant differences among groups, for several ele-\n\nments, in different matrices (Table 3).\n\nSome of the elements\u2014As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Mg, Mn,\n\nMo, Ni, and Pb\u2014presented higher values in exposed\n\ngroups (environmental and/or occupational) in all the\n\nmatrices when compared to controls. Among all the\n\nelements analysed, As, Cr, Mn, and Pb showed\n\nsignificantly different values in three different matri-\n\nces; Se in two; and Cd, Cu, Mg, Mo, S and Zn in one.\n\nNo significant differences were observed for Fe, Hg,\n\nNi, and Si in any matrix, while Cu and S presented\n\nsignificantly lower values in both exposed groups in\n\nblood and hair, respectively.\n\nWhen comparing these results with reference\n\nranges of exposure (Table 3), the level of exposure\n\nin our study groups was generally higher, for some\n\nelements in some of the matrices, particularly in blood\n\nand urine samples. Concerning nails and hair samples,\n\nthe vast majority of concentrations were within or\n\nrelatively close to the reference ranges (except for\n\nHg).\n\nResults of the multivariable analysis for the effect\n\nof exposure adjusted by age, smoking, and metal-\n\nspecific actual confounders, and stratified by gender in\n\nthose cases for which a significant effect modification\n\n(excluding the occupationally exposed group) was\n\nfound are presented in Table 4.\n\nAfter taking into account all possible confounding\n\nfactors, elements which still presented significantly\n\nhigher values in the exposed groups in one or more\n\nbiological matrices were As, Cr, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb,\n\nS, Se, and Zn. Copper was the only element showing\n\nsignificantly lower values in the exposed groups, both\n\nin blood and hair. All significant differences were\n\nobtained in the groups with environmental or both,\n\nenvironmental and occupational exposure, except for\n\nCu, Mn and Pb in hair, and Se in blood, which\n\nsignificantly differed from controls only in the occu-\n\npationally exposed group. No significant differences\n\nwere obtained for Cd, Fe, Hg, and Si. For some of\n\nthese elements, the significant differences were only\n\nobtained for one of the genders, namely Cr in toenails\n\n(only in females), Mg in blood (only in females), Mn\n\nin toenails (only in females), Ni in toenails (only in\n\nfemales), and Zn in blood (only in males).\n\nTable 5 shows the correlations between the con-\n\ncentration of the same metal(loid) in different matrices\n\n(only significant results are shown).\n\nOnly As, Hg, Mg, Mn, and Pb presented more than\n\none significant and positive correlation between two or\n\nmore matrices, and among these elements, only As and\n\nHg showed correlations between blood or urine and\n\nfingernails, toenails, or hair. Fingernail and toenail\n\nsamples were significantly correlated in all elements\n\nshown but Cd. Significant positive correlations were\n\nalso obtained between fingernails and hair for As, Hg,\n\nMn, and Pb, and between toenails and hair for As, Hg,\n\nand Mg.\n\nThe effects of gender, age, and smoking habits on\n\nthe levels of metal(loid)s in the different matrices were\n\nalso evaluated, and the results are presented in\n\nTable 6.\n\nConcerning gender, the majority of the elements\n\nshowed significantly higher values in males in blood\n\nand hair samples (except for Mg in hair, higher in\n\nfemales), and significantly higher values in females in\n\nurine, fingernails, and toenail. Regarding age, the\n\neffect depended mainly on the matrix. All elements\n\nshowed a significant increase in older groups in blood\n\nand urine samples, except Cu in blood, and a\n\nsignificant decrease with age in fingernails, toenails,\n\nand hair samples, except for Mn in toenails and Fe in\n\nhair. As regards smoking, significantly higher levels\n\nwere generally observed in smokers in the different\n\nmatrices, except for Hg in hair which was significantly\n\nlower. These results are also shown schematically in\n\nFig. 3.\n\nDiscussion\n\nA high degree of contamination by metal(loid)s was\n\nreported by geochemical campaigns involving various\n\nsample types around the Panasqueira mine (A?vila et al.\n\n2008; Salgueiro et al. 2008; Grangeia et al. 2011).\n\nMoreover, local health statistics report an elevated\n\nnumber of health complaints, with a significant\n\nnumber of individuals with cardiac, respiratory, and\n\nurinary diseases, and a high rate of deaths by cancer.\n\nTo evaluate the role of environmental contamination\n\nin populations living and working nearby, we carried\n\nEnviron Geochem Health\n\n123\n\nAuthor's personal copy\n\n\n\nTable 3 Concentrations of metal(loid)s in the different biological matrices in the exposure groups (mean \u00b1 SD)\n\nControls Environmentally\n\nexposed\n\nOccupationally\n\nexposed\n\nStatistical\n\nsignificance\n\nPublished/\n\nReference\n\nranges\na\n\nAs-B (lg/L) 11.67 \u00b1 6.58 17.23 \u00b1 11.13 14.71 \u00b1 12.48 2.6\u201317.8\n\nAs-U (lg/g creat) 60.17 \u00b1 72.28 93.34 \u00b1 105.38 71.38 \u00b1 118.07 2.3\u2013161\n\nAs-FN (lg/g) 0.14 \u00b1 0.10 0.61 \u00b1 1.04 1.31 \u00b1 2.88 ** 0.07\u20131.09\n\nAs-TN (lg/g) 0.22 \u00b1 0.30 0.65 \u00b1 0.56 1.01 \u00b1 2.36 ** 0.07\u20131.09\n\nAs-H (lg/g) 0.12 \u00b1 0.14 0.14 \u00b1 0.15 0.32 \u00b1 0.52 ** 0.03\u20130.32\n\nCd-B (lg/L) 2.44 \u00b1 0.68 2.31 \u00b1 0.32 2.62 \u00b1 0.94 0.15\u20132.04b\n\nCd-U (lg/g creat) 0.47 \u00b1 0.34 0.57 \u00b1 0.45 0.47 \u00b1 0.31 0.06\u20130.79\n\nCd-FN (lg/g) 0.12 \u00b1 0.13 0.15 \u00b1 0.22 0.10 \u00b1 0.12 0.01\u20130.44\n\nCd-TN (lg/g) 0.04 \u00b1 0.04 0.05 \u00b1 0.04 0.07 \u00b1 0.13 0.01\u20130.44\n\nCd-H (lg/g) 0.04 \u00b1 0.05 0.06 \u00b1 0.08 0.15 \u00b1 0.24 ** 0.01\u20130.36\n\nCr-U (lg/g creat) 1.23 \u00b1 0.98 1.58 \u00b1 0.83 1.12 \u00b1 0.68 ** 0.24\u20131.80\n\nCr-FN (lg/g) 1.27 \u00b1 1.42 1.66 \u00b1 2.82 0.95 \u00b1 0.62 0.22\u20133.20\n\nCr-TN (lg/g) 1.19 \u00b1 0.99 2.17 \u00b1 2.41 0.91 \u00b1 0.92 ** 0.22\u20133.20\n\nCr-H (lg/g) 0.07 \u00b1 0.06 0.07 \u00b1 0.08 0.18 \u00b1 0.33 * 0.05\u20130.53\n\nCu-B (lg/L) 1,386.84 \u00b1 590.29 1,017.44 \u00b1 235.46 948.19 \u00b1 106.98 ** 780\u20131,760\n\nCu-H (lg/g) 19.93 \u00b1 21.28 16.96 \u00b1 10.60 14.73 \u00b1 6.47 8.5\u201396\n\nFe-B (lg/L) 500,542.58 \u00b1 90,827.76 449,104.09 \u00b1 118,606.55 497,669.02 \u00b1 47,017.44 390,000\u2013550,000\n\nFe-H (lg/g) 12.22 \u00b1 12.57 11.15 \u00b1 7.65 13.94 \u00b1 9.20 4.9\u201323\n\nHg-U (lg/g creat) 1.09 \u00b1 0.70 1.13 \u00b1 0.93 1.09 \u00b1 0.89 0.14\u20132.21\n\nHg-FN (lg/g) 0.62 \u00b1 0.34 0.61 \u00b1 0.42 0.72 \u00b1 0.37 0.03\u20130.31\n\nHg-TN (lg/g) 0.48 \u00b1 0.26 0.46 \u00b1 0.48 0.51 \u00b1 0.36 0.03\u20130.31\n\nHg-H (lg/g) 1.58 \u00b1 0.90 1.50 \u00b1 1.27 1.77 \u00b1 0.89 0.05\u20130.93\n\nMg-B (lg/L) 27,623.66 \u00b1 4,741.42 30,179.31 \u00b1 4,162.05 28,268.58 \u00b1 3,441.56 * 31,200\u201334,200\n\nMg-FN (lg/g) 120.83 \u00b1 40.50 161.67 \u00b1 141.34 123.17 \u00b1 26.59 55\u2013191\n\nMg-TN (lg/g) 164.54 \u00b1 97.02 175.55 \u00b1 120.18 198.46 \u00b1 129.93 55\u2013191\n\nMg-H (lg/g) 51.52 \u00b1 65.34 56.47 \u00b1 47.84 34.17 \u00b1 25.71 8.5\u2013141\n\nMn-B (lg/L) 21.12 \u00b1 23.14 22.35 \u00b1 7.53 25.39 \u00b1 31.75 5\u201312.8\n\nMn-U (lg/g creat) 1.51 \u00b1 2.32 3.07 \u00b1 2.52 1.45 \u00b1 1.91 ** 0.11\u20131.32\n\nMn-FN (lg/g) 1.63 \u00b1 2.88 2.09 \u00b1 2.28 1.88 \u00b1 1.58 0.19\u20133.30\n\nMn-TN (lg/g) 1.25 \u00b1 1.29 2.84 \u00b1 3.17 1.98 \u00b1 3.19 * 0.19\u20133.30\n\nMn-H (lg/g) 0.70 \u00b1 0.84 0.77 \u00b1 0.69 1.50 \u00b1 1.65 * 0.08\u20132.41\n\nMo-B (lg/L) 3.75 \u00b1 2.64 9.25 \u00b1 8.48 6.78 \u00b1 7.20 * 0.77\u20137.86\n\nNi-U (lg/g creat) 6.14 \u00b1 3.33 7.94 \u00b1 6.20 7.53 \u00b1 6.89 0.59\u20134.06\n\nNi-FN (lg/g) 2.43 \u00b1 2.36 3.48 \u00b1 6.10 2.10 \u00b1 2.28 0.14\u20136.95\n\nNi-TN (lg/g) 1.24 \u00b1 1.03 4.12 \u00b1 9.20 0.98 \u00b1 0.90 0.14\u20136.95\n\nNi-H (lg/g) 0.37 \u00b1 0.25 0.30 \u00b1 0.24 0.47 \u00b1 0.85 0.11\u20131.60\n\nPb-B (lg/L) 36.01 \u00b1 25.81 34.08 \u00b1 39.39 63.72 \u00b1 58.56 ** 11.4\u201362.8\n\nPb-U (lg/g creat) 2.43 \u00b1 2.26 2.81 \u00b1 5.3 4.59 \u00b1 6.82 * 0.01\u20132.14\n\nPb-FN (lg/g) 1.33 \u00b1 0.97 1.61 \u00b1 1.65 1.72 \u00b1 1.28 0.27\u20134.75\n\nPb-TN (lg/g) 0.99 \u00b1 1.08 1.25 \u00b1 1.33 1.16 \u00b1 1.38 0.27\u20134.75\n\nPb-H (lg/g) 1.55 \u00b1 2.92 1.45 \u00b1 2.00 3.02 \u00b1 3.00 ** 0.22\u20137.26\n\nS-FN (lg/g) 30,090.67 \u00b1 8,361.79 37,401.52 \u00b1 21,791.54 31,868.07 \u00b1 4,487.16 23,400\u201343,500\n\nS-TN (lg/g) 25,737.22 \u00b1 7,822.65 28,490.47 \u00b1 19,176.70 25,158.77 \u00b1 5,925.07 23,400\u201343,500\n\nEnviron Geochem Health\n\n123\n\nAuthor's personal copy\n\n\n\nTable 4 Effect of exposure on metal(loid)s concentration.

The levels of\n\nmost elements have been extensively studied in these\n\nmatrices, and numerous validated biomarkers of\n\nexposure are available. As regards nails and hair\n\nsamples, in recent years, a number of studies using\n\nthese matrices have been carried out bringing new and\n\nimproved information that can help to quantify\n\nelements in these matrices and validate this approach\n\nto measure exposure in the near future.\n\nIn biomonitoring of environmental and occupa-\n\ntional exposure to toxic elements, nails are generally\n\npreferred to hair, as they do not become so easily\n\ncontaminated (Button et al. 2009). Further, toenails\n\nmay be a more reliable sample than fingernails, since\n\nthe latter come into contact with the atmosphere,\n\nmetallic objects, and other substances containing trace\n\nelements such as dyes. In contrast, toenails most of the\n\ntime are hidden in shoes, and therefore, they have\n\nlower contact with trace elements.\n\nUp to now, few studies have been conducted\n\ncomparing the levels of diverse elements in all five\n\ndifferent matrices (He 2011). The information pro-\n\nvided by each of them is rather different as blood and\n\nurine generally reflect recent exposures (days/few\n\nweeks), and hair and nails, particularly toenails, reflect\n\nexposures occurring in the last weeks/months. This\n\ndistinction may be not straightforward for some\n\nelements, such as Cd and Pb which accumulate in\n\nthe human body for years (half life of 10\u201312 years)\n\n(Dorne et al. 2011). The combination of results from\n\nall the matrices will allow better characterization of\n\nthe exposure.\n\nTaking into account all this information, our results\n\npoint to different types of exposure (past/recent) for\n\ndifferent elements in the exposed groups (Table 4). The\n\ngroup exposed to environmental toxins only apparently\n\nexperienced a pronounced and continuous (past and\n\nrecent) exposure to As, a moderate but continuous\n\nexposure to Mg, Mn, and Zn, a recent exposure to Mo,\n\nand past exposure to Cr, Ni, and S. Since Mo was only\n\nanalysed in blood samples, little can be said about the\n\ntimeframe of exposure to this compound. The second\n\ngroup (occupationally exposed) experienced a contin-\n\nuous exposure to Zn, recent exposure to Se, and long\n\nstanding exposure to As, Mn, and Pb.\n\nWe also investigated correlations between different\n\nmeasures of the same element in the four matrices\n\nanalysed (Table 5). If exposure occurs continuously,\n\nsignificant and positive correlations between the\n\ndifferent sample types are expected. As and Hg were\n\nthe only metal(loid)s that showed correlations\n\nbetween matrices compatible with the presence of\n\nrecent and past exposure. As expected, significant and\n\npositive correlations between fingernails and toenails\n\nwere obtained for most of these elements; significant\n\ncorrelations between finger/toenails and hair, and\n\nbetween blood and urine, were achieved for some of\n\nthem. It is important to highlight the fact that for some\n\nof the elements, not all the matrices were analysed.\n\nFor some of the elements studied, the concentra-\n\ntions reported here for blood and urine were above the\n\npublished reference ranges (Table 3). These reference\n\nranges were obtained from samples collected from\n\nItalian and Swedish healthy volunteers without a\n\ndetailed description of the environmental or occupa-\n\ntional exposure of these subjects, and therefore are\n\nonly indicative and may change significantly from\n\npopulation to population.

As regards\n\nthe Portuguese population, there are few studies that\n\nreport metal(loid) levels in exposed populations, and\n\nthey show wide changes in levels within the same\n\npopulation in different geographic areas (reviewed in\n\nCoelho et al. 2012). Therefore, in this study, we\n\ncompared the element concentration obtained for the\n\nexposed populations with those of the controls, as they\n\nwere matched for age, gender (only the environmen-\n\ntally exposed group), diet, lifestyle, geochemical\n\nenvironment, and residence.\n\nOur previous studies at the Panasqueira mine area\n\n(Coelho et al. 2011, 2012) indicated that the exposed\n\npopulations were experiencing severe health effects\n\nderived from exposure to the environmental and\n\noccupational contamination resulting from mining\n\nactivities; however, a more restricted number of\n\nsamples and a lower number of internal dose bio-\n\nmarkers limited major conclusions and lead us to\n\ndesign and perform a more complete and robust study.\n\nFrom the results in Table 3, it can be seen that the\n\nconcentrations of As, Cr, Mn, and Pb vary signifi-\n\ncantly among the three groups, with significant\n\ndifferences in three different media. These results\n\nwere influenced by confounding variables such as\n\ngender, age, smoking habits, and factors directly\n\nassociated with exposure, such as agriculture practice,\n\nfish consumption, and source of water for consump-\n\ntion. When adjusting for all these variables, some of\n\nthe elements were no longer significantly different\n\nbetween groups (Tables 3 vs. 4).\n\nModifying factors such as gender, age, socioeconomic\n\nstatus, and lifestyle factors in exposure and susceptibility\n\nto metal(loid)s have been reported in the literature to play\n\na role in modulating exposure to metal(loid)s. However,\n\nmost of these parameters are often overlooked, and\n\nadditional studies needed to be performed in order to fill\n\ngaps. Identification of these gaps provides information on\n\nsusceptibility factors which is critical to design guide-\n\nlines for preventive measures (Berglund et al. 2011).\n\nRegarding the effect of gender on the metal(loid) levels in\n\nthe different matrices, our results show that females have\n\nhigher concentrations of As, Cr, Mg, Mn, and Se in urine,\n\nfingernails, and toenails, while males have higher levels\n\nof Fe, Hg, Mg, Pb, S, and Zn in blood and hair samples.\n\nThe only exception was Mg in hair which presented\n\nwith significantly higher concentrations in females.\n\nInterestingly, this difference was reported before in\n\ndifferent studies aiming to evaluate the concentration of\n\nseveral trace elements in hair samples (Quereshi 1982;\n\nTakeuchi et al. 1982; Nowak and Kozlowski 1998;\n\nChojnacka et al. 2006). The higher levels of Pb in blood\n\nin males are also known and reported in several studies\n\nwith non-exposed, environmentally and/or occupation-\n\nally exposed individuals. Milman et al. (1994) suggested\n\nthat the difference in Pb blood levels between females\n\nand males could be explained by the higher content of\n\nhaemoglobin in men.\n\nGender differences in the exposure to toxic metals\n\nare well documented. In a review paper by Vahter\n\net al. (2007), several references to studies describing\n\nsignificant differences in internal levels of elements\n\nbetween males and females were described and\n\ncommented. Berglund et al. (2011) reported that\n\nfemales seemed to be more at risk for toxic metal\n\nexposure than males, and this finding was confirmed in\n\nour study, where females had significantly higher\n\nlevels of several genotoxic elements, i.e. As, Cr, and\n\nMn. Differences between genders can be due to\n\ndifferent patterns of exposure, with one of the genders\n\nbeing more exposed to certain metal(loid)s, although\n\nthe presence of different toxicokinetic mechanisms\n\nbetween both genders should be taking into account.\n\nConcerning the effect of age, we found older\n\nindividuals having higher concentrations in blood and\n\nurine (As, Cu, Mg, and Zn), and younger individuals\n\nhaving higher concentrations in nails and hair (As, Cr,\n\nFe, Mg, Mn, and Se). These differences, besides\n\ndifferent patterns of exposure, may be due to different\n\ntoxicokinetic rates, possibly because of the lower\n\nproportion of water in the organism, lower absorption,\n\nand excretion rates, and possible nutritional deficien-\n\ncies, and comorbidities in older individuals.\n\nFinally, the analysis of the effect of smoking showed\n\nthat smokers have significantly higher concentration of\n\nseveral elements, although the levels of Hg in hair were\n\nhigher in non-smokers. This finding was not expected\n\nsince tobacco smoke contains Hg, but a similar result\n\nwas previously reported by Chojnacka et al. (2006).\n\nConclusions\n\nOverall our results agree with those obtained in the\n\nenvironmental studies performed in Panasqueira mine\n\narea, showing as populations living nearby and\n\nEnviron Geochem Health\n\n123\n\nAuthor's personal copy\n\n\n\nworking in the mine are exposed to several metal(loid)s\n\noriginated by mining activities. The most important\n\nexposure seemed to be to As, particularly in individuals\n\nexposed through the environment. Exposure to other\n\nelements such as Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn also occurs\n\nbut not at the same extent (amount of element/time of\n\nexposure). Our results indicate that the environmen-\n\ntally exposed group is more affected, specifically\n\nfemales, as they presented significantly higher values\n\nof the most toxic elements, i.e. As, Cr, Mn, and Ni.\n\nThese findings highlight once more the need for the\n\ncompetent authorities to intervene in this area in order\n\nto prevent that severe health consequences occur in\n\nexposed populations. Not only human populations are\n\nat risk but the entire ecosystem.\n\nOur results show also major effects of host factors\n\nand smoking habits on the levels of metal(loid)s in the\n\ndifferent biological samples analysed, strongly influ-\n\nencing the results obtained. Studies with a higher\n\nnumber of individuals, analysing all the elements in all\n\nthe matrices, need to be performed in order to better\n\ncharacterize the factors influencing the exposure, the\n\ntoxicokinetic processes in the population groups, and\n\nthe feasibility of the different biological samples for\n\nexposure assessment.\n\nAcknowledgments This work was supported by the Portuguese\nFoundation for Science and Technology through Grants SFRH/\n\nBD/47781/2008, SFRH/BD/63343/2009, and SFRH/BPD/26689/\n\n2006, and project PTDC/SAU-ESA/102367/2008.
