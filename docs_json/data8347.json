Part of this CO2 has been absorbed by oceans, inducing ocean \n\nacidification and, therefore, several impacts in the marine biota. Natural shallow-water CO2 \n\nvents have generated a substantial interest in recent years as in situ laboratories for ocean \n\nacidification studies. The present study was focused on the effects of ocean acidification on \n\nmesozooplankton communities. Two active volcanic areas with submarine CO2 emissions, in \n\nthe islands of S\u00e3o Miguel and Faial, were chosen and independently studied, through the \n\nchoice of three different sites: Reference, Intermediate and Vent, characterized for their \n\nincrease in the CO2 degassing activity, and consequent pH decrease. Differences in the \n\nabundance, diversity and structure of mesozooplankton among sites were described, along \n\nwith the characterization of the community in these areas, since previous information is \n\nscarce. Differences were found in the composition of the zooplanktonic assemblages among \n\nsites in S\u00e3o Miguel and among dates in Faial. Through the nMDS analyses, Radiozoa, \n\nParacalanus parvus and Evadne spinifera appeared more related to vent conditions, while \n\nCirripedia nauplii were closer to the reference conditions. Conditions in Faial did not allow a \n\nclear separation among sites in the nMDS analyses, since the strong currents mix the water, \n\ndissipating the effect of the gas emissions, and variation among days becomes more important \n\nand statistically significant. The RNA:DNA ratio of selected mesozooplankton populations \n\nwas used, as proxies for physiological condition. RNA:DNA did not show a clear pattern of \n\nvariation, copepods in S\u00e3o Miguel and cladocerans in Faial had an higher ratio in the \n\nreference sites, but with no gradual decrease to the Vent. Fish eggs seem to have an inverted \n\npattern. Additional experiments conducted under natural conditions were performed to \n\ndetermine the egg production rate (EPR) of the dominant free-spawning copepod species, as a \n\nproxy for secondary production. In S\u00e3o Miguel, the EPR showed a decreasing trend along the \n\nCO2 gradient, with no differences between the exposure times. In Faial, EPR was higher in \n\nthe reference, but it did not differ significantly from the other sites. This study demonstrated \n\nthe suitability of the submarine degassing sites in S. Miguel and Faial Islands for investigating \n\nthe effect of future dissolved CO2 levels in planktonic and pelagic communities of the NE \n\nAtlantic. It also provided the first in-situ evidence of a significant decrease of EPR of \n\ncopepods under near future CO2 levels. \n\nKey words: ocean acidification, mesozooplankton, shallow-water CO2 vents, copepods, egg \n\nproduction rate. \n\n\n\n \n \n\nIV \n \n\nResumo \n\nDesde os tempos pre-industriais que se registou um incremento do CO2 atmosf\u00e9rico, de pelo \n\nmenos 30% devido a atividades humanas, principalmente pelo uso de combust\u00edveis f\u00f3sseis. \n\nOs oceanos t\u00eam absorvido parte deste CO2 atrav\u00e9s da sua capacidade de \u201csumidouro de \n\ncarbono\u201d, induzindo mudan\u00e7as na composi\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica da \u00e1gua do mar (acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\noceano), com potenciais impactos nos organismos marinhos. As poss\u00edveis consequ\u00eancias \n\necol\u00f3gicas deste processo t\u00eam motivado um incremento no esfor\u00e7o de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o nos \n\n\u00faltimos anos. A maioria dos efeitos nos organismos marinhos tem sido observada em \n\nexperi\u00eancias no laborat\u00f3rio, onde o CO2 \u00e9 manipulado em escalas temporais curtas. N\u00e3o \n\nobstante, a necessidade de usar diferentes abordagens, como experi\u00eancias de campo, em \n\nambientes marinhos espec\u00edficos que contenham comunidades, mais do que esp\u00e9cies isoladas, \n\ntornou-se evidente. Locais de desgaseifica\u00e7\u00e3o natural de CO2 em \u00e1guas pouco profundas t\u00eam \n\ngerado um interesse substancial como laborat\u00f3rios in situ para estudos de acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\noceano. Altera\u00e7\u00f5es significativas na estrutura da comunidade bent\u00f3nica t\u00eam sido associadas \n\ncom estes locais de desgaseifica\u00e7\u00e3o, mas os efeitos no pl\u00e2ncton permanecem largamente \n\ndesconhecidos. O presente estudo analisou os efeitos da acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o do oceano nas \n\ncomunidades de mesozoopl\u00e2ncton. Os objetivos especificos foram (i): o estudo observacional \n\nsobre as comunidades zooplanct\u00f3nicas, para determinar se existem diferen\u00e7as consistentes na \n\nabund\u00e2ncia, diversidade e composi\u00e7\u00e3o entre os locais afetados por emiss\u00f5es de CO2 e os \n\nlocais de controlo, sem emiss\u00f5es; e (ii) a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre os padr\u00f5es observados no zoopl\u00e2ncton \n\nem rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos resultados detetados na qu\u00edmica da \u00e1gua do mar e do g\u00e1s das emiss\u00f5es, (iii) a \n\ndescri\u00e7\u00e3o do estado ecofisiol\u00f3gico de grandes grupos de zoopl\u00e2ncton utilizando \u00edndices \n\nderivados dos \u00e1cidos nucleicos e \u00edndices de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de ovos e a sua rela\u00e7\u00e3o com o poss\u00edvel \n\nstress causado pela acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o. Para atingir estes objetivos foram seleccionadas duas \u00e1reas \n\nvulc\u00e2nicas activas, com emana\u00e7\u00f5es de CO2 submarinas, uma na ilha de S\u00e3o Miguel e outra na \n\nilha de Faial, no arquip\u00e9lago dos A\u00e7ores. Cada ilha foi independentemente estudada, atrav\u00e9s \n\nda escolha de tr\u00eas lugares diferentes: Reference, Intermediate e Vent, ao longo de um \n\ngradiente na emiss\u00e3o de CO2, e consequente diminui\u00e7\u00e3o de pH. O pH em S\u00e3o Miguel variou \n\nde 8.06 no Reference (pCO2 383.80 \u00b5atm) a 7.75 no Vent (pCO2 983.10 \u00b5atm), enquanto que \n\nno Faial diminuiu de 8.13 no Reference (pCO2 319.37 \u00b5atm) a 7.88 no Vent (pCO2 894.08 \n\n\u00b5atm). O CO2 foi o principal constituinte das emiss\u00f5es de g\u00e1s nas duas ilhas (acima de 98%), \n\nminimizando o efeito de outros gases como H2S. Em S\u00e3o Miguel o mesozoopl\u00e2ncton foi \n\namostrado usando arrastos obl\u00edquos com uma rede WP2 de \u00d860cm e malhagem de 200 ?m, \n\n\n\n \n \n\nV \n \n\nentre os dias 3 e 7 de Julho de 2014, enquanto que no Faial foi usada uma rede com \n\nmalhagem de 500\u00b5m e a amostragem foi feita entre os dias 10 e 15 de Julho de 2014. Foram \n\ndescritas as diferen\u00e7as na abund\u00e2ncia, diversidade e estrutura do mesozoopl\u00e2ncton entre \n\nlocais, em paralelo com a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o das comunidades nestas \u00e1reas, j\u00e1 que a informa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\npr\u00e9via era escassa. Foram identificados organismos de nove filos, num total de 71 taxa \n\ndiferentes, 45 em  S. Miguel e 61 no Faial. Em S\u00e3o Miguel foram encontradas diferen\u00e7as \n\nentre locais na abund\u00e2ncia total e nas abund\u00e2ncias de Arthropoda e Chordata, com um \n\nincremento no Vent, relativamente ao Intermediate e o Reference. No Faial foram apenas \n\nencontradas diferen\u00e7as na diversidade dos Arthropoda. A an\u00e1lise PERMANOVA ilustrou as \n\ndiferen\u00e7as na composi\u00e7\u00e3o do zoopl\u00e2ncton entre locais, em S\u00e3o Miguel, e entre datas, no Faial. \n\nOs principais contribuintes para estas diferen\u00e7as, real\u00e7ados pelas ana\u00e1ises SIMPER, foram \n\nEvadne spinifera, Paracalanus parvus, nauplios de Cirripedia e Radiozoa. Atrav\u00e9s das \n\nan\u00e1lises nMDS, Radiozoa, Paracalanus parvus e Evadne spinifera apareceram mais \n\nrelacionados \u00e0s condi\u00e7\u00f5es do Vent, enquanto que nauplios de Cirripedia estiveram mais perto \n\ndas condi\u00e7\u00f5es do Reference. No Faial, os principais contribuintes foram Bassia bassensis, \n\nRadiozoa e efiras de Scyphozoa. As condi\u00e7\u00f5es nesta ilha n\u00e3o permitiram uma separa\u00e7\u00e3o entre \n\nlocais nas an\u00e1lises nMDS, dado que as fortes correntes misturaram a coluna de \u00e0gua, \n\ndissipando o efeito das emiss\u00f5es de gases, e a varia\u00e7\u00e3o entre dias \u00e9 aparentemente mais \n\nimportante e estatisticamente significativa. \n\nO racio RNA:DNA de popula\u00e7\u00f5es de mesozoopl\u00e2ncton seleccionadas foi usado como \n\nindicador da condi\u00e7\u00e3o fisiol\u00f3gica. O RNA:DNA n\u00e3o mostrou um padr\u00e3o claro de varia\u00e7\u00e3o: \n\nCopepoda em S\u00e3o Miguel e Cladocera no Faial apresentaram valores mais elevados no \n\nReference, mas este n\u00e3o diminuiu de forma gradual ao longo do gradiente de CO2. Os ovos de \n\npeixe parecem ter um padr\u00e3o invertido. Experi\u00eancias adicionais foram levados a cabo para \n\ndeterminar a taxa de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de ovos (EPR) das esp\u00e9cies dominantes de cop\u00e9podes, como \n\nindicador da produ\u00e7\u00e3o secund\u00e1ria. As c\u00e2maras de incuba\u00e7\u00e3o foram colocadas perto do fundo \n\ndurante per\u00edodos de 24 e 72h em S\u00e3o Miguel, e 72h no Faial. Em S\u00e3o Miguel, a EPR mostrou \n\numa tend\u00eancia de diminui\u00e7\u00e3o ao longo do gradiente de CO2, sem diferen\u00e7as nos tempos de \n\nexposi\u00e7\u00e3o. No Faial, EPR foi maior no Reference, mas n\u00e3o diferiu significativamente dos \n\noutros locais. \n\nEste estudo demonstrou o potencial das zonas de desgaseifica\u00e7\u00e3o submarina nas ilhas de S. \n\nMiguel e Faial para a investiga\u00e7\u00e3o dos efeitos dos n\u00edveis futuros de CO2 dissolvido nas \n\n\n\n \n \n\nVI \n \n\ncomunidades planct\u00f3nicas e pel\u00e1gicas do Atl\u00e2ntico NE. Este trabalho tamb\u00e9m permitiu \n\nregistar a primeira evid\u00eancia in-situ de uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o significativa da produ\u00e7\u00e3o secund\u00e1ria \n\nem cop\u00e9podes sob concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de CO2 previstas para o final do s\u00e9culo. \n\nPalavras-chave: acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o do oceano, mesozoopl\u00e2ncton, locais de desgaseifica\u00e7\u00e3o natural \n\nde CO2 em \u00e1guas pouco profundas, cop\u00e9podes, taxa de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de ovos. \n\n\n\n \n \n\nVII \n \n\nList of figures \n\nFigure 1.1.

Introduction \n\n1.1.Global change \n\nEconomic growth in the industrial age has brought unprecedented wealth to the planet;  in the \n\nU.K., the birthplace of the industrial revolution, real GDP per capita has grown by 12 times \n\nsince 1830 (Erickson, 2014). Growth in economic activity has also come at a cost, as \n\ngreenhouse gases (GHG) emissions have grown since pre-industrial times (IPCC, 2007), \n\nwhile CO2 has increased by approximately 30% (Carman et al., 2004). \n\nSince 1751 approximately 337 billion metric tons of carbon have been released to the \n\natmosphere from the consumption of fossil fuels and cement production. Half of these \n\nemissions have occurred since the mid-1970s. The 2007 global fossil-fuel carbon emission \n\nestimate, 8365 million metric tons of carbon, represents an all-time high and a 1.7% increase \n\nfrom 2006 (Boden et al., 2010). Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further \n\nwarming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the \n\nlikelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems (IPCC, \n\n2014). \n\nCarbon dioxide represents 75% of anthropogenic GHG emissions, followed by CH4, N2O and \n\nothers fluorinated gases (figure 1.1). The human activities responsible for the increased \n\nemissions include in first place the burning of fossil fuels use and industrial processes and, to \n\na lesser extent, changes to land use, including deforestation. \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n \nFigure 1.1. Total annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (gigatonne of CO2-equivalent per year) for the \nperiod 1970 to 2010 by gases: CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes; CO2 from Forestry and \n\nOther Land Use (FOLU); methane (CH4); nitrous oxide (N2O); fluorinated gases covered under the Kyoto \n\nProtocol (F-gases) (From: ipcc, 2014). \n\nMeasurements of atmospheric CO2 during the last 56 years have revealed a consistent \n\nincrease, from an annual average of 315,24 ppm in 1958 to 365,11 ppm in 2014 \n\n(CO2Now.org, 2014). This current level is also much higher than it has been at any time over \n\nthe course of human civilization (Harrould-Kolieb &amp; Savitz, 2009). In spite of these large \n\nCO2 sinks, atmospheric CO2 increased at a rate of approximately 3.3 Gt C y\n\u20131\n\n, and thus \n\natmospheric CO2 concentrations continued to rise (Carman et al., 2004). A large fraction of \n\nanthropogenic climate change resulting from CO2 emissions is irreversible on a multi-century \n\nto millennial time scale, except in the case of a large net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere \n\nover a sustained period (ipcc, 2014). \n\nBesides CO2 contribution, methane in second place is a potent greenhouse gas, and oceans \n\nseem as a supplier of vast quantities to the atmosphere (Ingall, 2008). It has been proposed by \n\nKarl et al. (2008) that the net efflux of methane from ocean to atmosphere is driven by \n\naerobic methane production, fuelled by the microbial use of methylphosphonic acid (MPn) as \n\na source of phosphorus in phosphate-stressed waters. During MPn utilization, methane is \n\nquantitatively released, whereas phosphorous is incorporated into new cell mass (Karl et al., \n\n2008). Metcalf et al. (2012) identified a phosphonate biosynthetic gene cluster in an abundant \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\nmarine archaeon of surface waters, reaffirming the idea of that MPn synthesis is prevalent in \n\nmarine systems. Since nutrients availability in the upper ocean is largely controlled by the \n\nupwelling from the deep-ocean, and mixing between surface and deep-ocean layers is \n\npredicted to decrease, it could promote the use by marine microbes of phosphonates (Karl et \n\nal., 2008) found in the low-molecular-weight fraction of dissolved organic matter (Ingall, \n\n2008). \n\n1.2.Ocean acidification \n\nThe oceans cover about 71% of Earth\u2019s surface to an average depth of 3700 m (P\u00f6rtner et al., \n\n2014). They play a vital role in global biogeochemical cycles, contribute enormously to the \n\nplanet\u2019s biodiversity and provide a livelihood for millions of people (Raven et al., 2005). \n\nSeveral sources indicate that oceans have the capacity to absorb part of this carbon dioxide, \n\nacting as a \u201ccarbon sink\u201d and thus, moderating the impact of climate change on terrestrial life \n\n(Harrould-Kolieb &amp; Savitz, 2009). Approximately one-third of the CO2 that has entered the \n\natmosphere over the past 100 years has been absorbed into ocean surface waters and has \n\nresulted in the elevation of partial pressure of CO2 in seawater and reduction of seawater pH \n\n(Kurihara, 2008). \n\nWithout the oceans playing this role, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere \n\nwould be 55% higher (Fabry et al., 2004). Prior to the Industrial Revolution the oceans were \n\nin relative equilibrium with the atmosphere, absorbing about the same amount of carbon \n\ndioxide each year as they released (2.15 billion metric tons of CO2) (Harrould-Kolieb &amp; \n\nSavitz, 2009). However, as the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has \n\nincreased, the flux of CO2 from the atmosphere to the ocean has reduced the average pH of \n\nsea water by about 0.1 pH units over the past century, with the greatest reduction occurring at \n\nhigh latitudes (Cramer et al., 2014), equivalent to a ca. 25 % increase in acidity (Havenhand, \n\n2012). The oceans will continue to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as long as the \n\nconcentration of carbon dioxide in the surface waters is less than that in the atmosphere \n\n(Harrould-Kolieb &amp; Savitz, 2009). \n\nThe carbon dioxide absorption will result in an unavoidable decreasing of the pH over the \n\nnext several centuries, comparing to any inferred from the geological record of the past 300 \n\nmillion years, with the possible exception of those resulting from rare, extreme events such as \n\nbolide impacts or catastrophic methane hydrate degassing (Caldeira &amp; Wickett, 2003). It is \n\npredicted that by 2100 surface ocean pH could fall by 0.3/0.4 units and pCO2 of 750ppm \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n4 \n \n\n(Fitzer et al., 2012; Dupont &amp; Thorndyke, 2009; Havenhand, 2012), and according with the \n\nIPCC emissions scenarios, if there is an unrestricted burning of fossil fuels, an extreme \n\nscenario with a reduction of 0.7 units will occur until 24\nth\n\n century (Caldeira &amp; Wickett, 2003). \n\nThe acid\u2013base chemistry of the CO2\u2013carbonate system in the sea \n\nThe alkalinity of seawater, which expresses the buffering capacity of water or the capacity of \n\nthe water to neutralize acids, is governed by the minerals dissolved, to which bicarbonates \n\ncontribute largely. The pH is an indication for the acidity of a substance. It is determined by \n\nthe number of free hydrogen ions (H\n+\n). Thus, the surface waters of the open ocean vary \n\nbetween pH 7.9 and 8.3, while coastal waters, in contrast, routinely vary between mean pH \n\n7.5 and 8.5 dependent on the habitat and show much larger seasonal and diel fluctuations \n\n(Kerrison, 2011). It is largely a function of the dissociation of dissolved inorganic carbon \n\n(DIC), whose relative proportions by mass are ?0.5% aqueous CO2, ?89% bicarbonate \n\n(HCO\n3-\n\n), and ?11% carbonate ions (CO3\n2-\n\n ) (Waldbusser &amp; Salisbury, 2014). According to \n\nHenry\u2019s Law, in a simple aqueous solution we would expect the concentration of CO2 in the \n\nair to be proportional to that in the solution of carbonic acid (Raven et al, 2005). So changes \n\nin atmospheric pCO2 will directly affect the carbonate system of the surface ocean, since \n\natmosphere and surface ocean exchange CO2 on time scales of several months (Rost et al., \n\n2008) (figure 1.2). \n\n \nFigure 1.2. Predicted changes in the surface ocean carbonate system in response to changes in atmospheric \npCO2 assuming the IS92a Scenario (From: Rost et al, 2008). \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\nA portion of the dissolved carbon dioxide reacts with seawater to form carbonic acid \n\n(H2CO3), and then it can divides in HCO\n3-\n\n (bicarbonate ion) releasing one H\n+\n to the solution. \n\nWhen the H\n+\n content is low, the CO3\n\n2\u2013\n (carbonate ion) increase, while a high H\n\n+\n concentration \n\ncauses a reaction to the carbonate becoming HCO\n3-\n\n. Thus, the net effect of the dissolution of \n\nCO2 in seawater is to alter this equilibrium, increasing the concentrations of H\n+\n, H2CO3 and \n\nHCO\n3\u2013\n\n, while decreasing concentrations of CO3\n2\u2013\n\n  (figure 1.3). \n\n \nFigure 1.3. Distribution of Total Carbon Dioxide, Bicarbonate, and Carbonate in function of the seawater pH \n\n(From: Raven et al., 2005) \n\nThe term \u2018carbonate buffer\u2019 is used to describe how the dissolved inorganic carbon system in \n\nseawater acts to diminish changes in ocean H\n+\n concentration, and thus stabilize pH (Raven et \n\nal., 2005) (figure 1.4). It occurs first for the CO2 uptake from the atmosphere and second, for \n\nthe interaction of seawater with oceanic sediments composed of CaCO3, which is mainly \n\ncontrolled by a \u201cbiological pump\u201d. The pump may be defined as the movement of CO2 that \n\nenters into the ocean from the atmosphere to the deep-ocean floor through biological \n\nprocesses, i.e. photosynthetic fixation of CO2 by phytoplankton, passive export of organic \n\ncarbon (e.g. fecal pellets of zooplankton, detritus, and dead organisms) and carbonates (e.g. \n\nshells and bones) by gravitation, or through vertical migration of zooplankton to the deep \n\nocean (Kurihara et al., 2004a). \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n \nFigure 1.4. The carbonate system of seawater. CCS (carbon capture and storage) is the excess of CO2 produced \nthat is dissolved and stored into the ocean. It will participate dissolving the CaCO3 and altering the carbonates \n\nequilibrium (From: British Geological Survey). \n\nThe preservation of the organisms in sea floor sediments depends on the solubility of CaCO3 \n\nin seawater and on the concentration of carbonate ions. Thus, there is a critical concentration \n\nof carbonate ions in seawater (the saturation concentration) below which CaCO3 will start to \n\ndissolve. Because CaCO3 solubility increases with decreasing temperature and increasing \n\npressure, the critical concentration occurs at a depth, the \u2018saturation horizon\u2019, below which \n\nseawater is undersaturated and CaCO3 will tend to dissolve and above which seawater is \n\nsuper-saturated and CaCO3 will tend to be preserved. Because the CaCO3 mineral calcite is \n\nless soluble than the form aragonite, the aragonite saturation horizon is shallower. Because \n\nadded CO2 decreases the carbonate ion concentration, the saturation horizons will become \n\nshallower with increasing releases of human derived CO2 to the atmosphere (Raven et al., \n\n2005). It is estimated that highlatitude surface oceans will become undersaturated with respect \n\nto aragonite by the year 2050, which may lead to the dissolution of aragonite shells (Kurihara, \n\n2008). \n\nConsequences for the biota \n\nWhile the chemical processes underlying ocean acidification are well understood and \n\naccepted, we are just beginning to understand the wide-ranging effects acidification is likely \n\nto have on marine wildlife (Harrould-Kolieb &amp; Savitz, 2009). Given that seawater carbonate \n\nchemistry can be highly variable, conditions that organisms are actually exposed to are \n\ndifficult to measure Furthermore, the sensitivity of organisms can vary across life history \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\nstages and in conjunction with other stressors (Waldbusser &amp; Salisbury, 2014). The potential \n\nrisks to marine systems from the current period of ocean acidification remain to be quantified; \n\nas yet, there are few robust indicators of the likely long-term biological consequences (Fitzer \n\net al., 2012). Evidence from the geological record shows that previous periods of intense \n\nocean acidification, e.g. at the end of the Paleocene, coincided with mass extinction events \n\n(Jackson, 2010). \n\nA major consequence of increasing ocean acidity is a reduction in the amount of carbonate \n\navailable (as CO3\n2-\n\n) for marine biota. One of the most important uses of carbonate in the \n\nocean is the formation of calcium carbonate or limestone structures such as corals skeletons, \n\npearls, and the shells of coccolithophores, foraminiferans, pteropods or bivalves, i.e. the \n\ncalcifiers  (Raven et al., 2005; Caldeira &amp; Wickett, 2003; Kurihara, 2008; Fabry et al., 2008). \n\nCalcification is only one physiological parameter affected by the ocean acidification, marine \n\norganisms can experience physiological stress not directly related to calcification due to an \n\nincrease in CO2 (hypercapnia) and/or a decrease in pH (Dupont &amp; Thorndyke, 2009). The life \n\ncycle stages are differently susceptible, being reproductive and early life-story stages \n\nconsidered particularly vulnerable (Fitzer et al., 2012; Kurihara, 2008; Dupont &amp; Thorndyke, \n\n2009). Even if increased acidity may not directly kill non-calcifying organisms, many are \n\nlikely to be harmed in ways that reduce their overall fitness and ability to survive. These \n\nimpacts could include decreased growth rate, reduced reproduction, disrupted respiratory and \n\nnervous system function and increased susceptibility to predators and disease, all of which \n\ncould produce ripple effects through food webs and ecosystems. Ultimately, ocean \n\nacidification could transform the oceans, leaving them far less diverse and productive and \n\nmaking the lives and livelihoods of those who depend on them far more uncertain (Harrould-\n\nKolieb &amp; Savitz, 2009). \n\nMost biota reside near the surface, where the greatest pH change would be expected to occur, \n\nbut deep-ocean biota may be more sensitive to pH changes (Caldeira &amp; Wickett, 2003), since \n\nCaCO3 is abundant in sediments, so the pH of the deep oceans cannot change by large \n\namounts over timescales of 10000 years (Raven et al., 2005). However, another view has to \n\nbe considered, organisms adapted to warm environments appear to be closer to thermal \n\nthresholds than cold-adapted organisms are, and plasticity in physiology may be costly to \n\nother functions, such as reproduction (Waldbusser &amp; Salisbury, 2014). Further, extreme \n\ntemperature events are principal drivers of biogeographic redistribution (Wethey et al., 2011). \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\nConsequences for zooplankton \n\nZooplankton is a key component of aquatic communities, and knowledge of how they cope \n\nwith environmental stressors is important for understanding how the aquatic ecosystem as a \n\nwhole will respond (Chan et al., 2008). The holozooplanktonic CaCO3 producers are the \n\nforaminifera (shells of calcite), euthecosomatous pteropods (shells of aragonite), heteropods \n\n(tropical and subtropical oceans, shells of aragonite not always present) and gymnosomes \n\n(shells of aragonite cast off at metamorphosis) (Fabry et al., 2008), so it is expected that these \n\ngroups will be affected under acidification conditions by reducing calcification. \n\nResponses can be variable ranging from negative to neutral or even positive and appear to be \n\nspecies-specific even in closely related species (Troedsson et al., 2013). Broadcast spawning \n\ninvertebrates are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification because fertilization of eggs \n\nand sperm occurs in the water column followed by development of larvae. Lecithotrophic \n\nlarvae (10% of marine benthic invertebrates), may be better competitors and less affected \n\nsince they spend less time in plankton, than planktotrophic larvae (60\u201390% of marine \n\norganisms) which feed on exogenous sources. Any sub-lethal reductions in rate of \n\ndevelopment and larval size may also have significant consequences for the survival of \n\nmarine larvae because prolonged larval life phase and delayed settlement may lead to a \n\nconcomitant increase in the likelihood of predation (Ross et al., 2011). Larvae of benthic \n\ncalcified organisms will respond with a reduction in calcification rate. \n\nAt date, most studies about how ocean acidification can influence the zooplankton community \n\nare short-term assays under controlled conditions focused in very restricted groups. These are \n\nnot always relevant to predicted climate impacts on ecosystems (e.g. using unrealistic pH \n\nvalues and/or acid-based acidification without correcting carbonates and bicarbonates) or \n\necologically realistic (e.g. single species cultures) conditions (Dupont &amp; Thorndyke, 2009). \n\nSince copepods are the main component in marine zooplankton, the most abundant species in \n\neach region should be the targets to elucidate responses to CO2 changes. \n\nPlanktonic copepods typically account for about 55\u201395% of the biomass in pelagic \n\nzooplankton community and are the dominant herbivores (Longhurst, 1985). While \n\nheterotrophic protists in the microbial loop are considered to be the main consumers and \n\nrecyclers of smaller plankton, copepods mainly transfer carbon captured at lower trophic \n\nlevels to higher trophic levels (Troedsson et al., 2013). The timing and the intensity of \n\ncopepod reproduction is considered to be essential for survival of fish larvae, since they feed \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\nlargely on copepod eggs or nauplii during their early feeding stage. Furthermore, several \n\npelagic fish stocks feed on copepods during their entire lifetime, and their individual growth \n\nas well as stock production is highly affected by copepod availability (Debes et al., 2008). \n\nMany studies, mostly under controlled conditions, manifest the effects of seawater \n\nacidification in different aspects of survival of copepods (annex 7.1). Most of these studies \n\nconducted until date showed no responses in copepods or low only when high CO2 \n\nconcentrations are applied. In addition, the effects of elevated pCO2 on the survival rates of \n\ncopepods are highly species-specific. Negative responses are more related to early-life stages \n\nof copepods i.e. eggs and nauplii production and survival. As example, Calanus finmarchicus \n\nsurvival and early development is not affected by pCO2 levels ?2000 ppm, only changes at \n\nmore than 7000ppm are observables (Pedersen et al., 2013). As in others organisms, these \n\neffects can be studied at many levels, as was shown in the previous section. Li and Gao \n\n(2012) hypothesized that the increased partial pressure of CO2 and acidity of seawater may \n\naffect the respiration of copepods to cope with the chemical changes, and hence it would \n\nmediate their feeding rate to meet the energy demand. Centropages tenuiremis, the dominant \n\ncostal water calanoid copepod in South China Sea, was able to perceive the chemical changes \n\nin seawater (>1700 \u00b5atm, pH &lt;7.60) with avoidance strategy. The respiration increased at \n\nelevated CO2 (1000 \u00b5atm) and associated acidity (pH 7.83) and its feeding rates also \n\nincreased correspondingly, except for the initial acclimating period, when it fed less. \n\nThe naupliar production has been a common way to determine the reproductive response on \n\ncopepods. Different assays under different controlled pH conditions have been carried out. \n\nThe naupliar production of Tisbe battagliai (Guernsey, UK) increased significantly at pH 7.95 \n\ncompared with pH 8.06 followed by a decline at pH 7.82, attributed to an initial stress \n\nresponse which was succeeded by a hormesis-like response at pH 7.67 (Fitzer et al., 2012). \n\nFurther, there was a significant growth reduction and a significant increase in the proportion \n\nof carbon relative to oxygen within the cuticle as seawater pH decreased. This strongly \n\nsuggests that copepods preferentially reallocate resources towards maintaining reproductive \n\noutput at the expense of somatic growth and cuticle composition. These responses may drive \n\nshifts in life history strategies that favour smaller brood sizes, females and perhaps later \n\nmaturing females, with the potential to profoundly destabilise marine trophodynamics (Fitzer \n\net al., 2012). In contrast, the nauplii of Tigriopus japonicas, a common benthic copepod in \n\ncoastal areas of the temperate zone of Japan, show a high tolerance to elevated pCO2 \n\nenvironments (37,000 \u00b5atm) (Kita et al., 2013). Cripps et al (2014) affirm in their recent \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\nstudy that nauplii show the highest lethal effects of CO2; Acartia tonsa nauplii mortality rates \n\nincreased threefold when pCO2 concentrations reached 1000 \u00b5atm (year 2100 scenario) with \n\nlethal concentration 50 at 1084 \u00b5atm pCO2. In comparison, eggs, early copepodite stages, and \n\nadult males and females were not affected lethally until pCO2 concentrations ?3000 \u00b5atm. \n\nThe egg production rate of Acartia spinicauda, Calanus sinicus and Centropages tenuiremis \n\n(the dominant copepods in the southern coast of China) is significantly inhibited by the \n\nincreased pCO2 and the exposure time duration (6.92?pH?7.39), while Acartia pacifica only \n\nshow inhibition with the exposure time duration (Zhang et al., 2011). Calanus glacialis egg \n\nproduction (an Arctic shelf-water copepod) showed no effects under CO2-induced seawater \n\nacidification. However, a reduction in pH to 6.9 significantly delayed hatching and possibly \n\nreduced overall hatching success (Weidmann et al., 2012). \n\nAcartia steueri and Acartia erythraea (Japan) showed sensitivity when cultured under \n\nincreses pCO2 of +10000ppm (pH 6.8) relative to control. The egg production rates of \n\ncopepods decreased significantly. In addition, the nauplius mortality rate increased in A. \n\nerythraea. The survival rates of adult of A. steueri were not affected when reared under \n\nincreased CO2 for 8 days, however longer exposure times could have revealed toxic effects of \n\nelevated CO2 concentrations (Kurihara et al., 2004b). These CO2 values are too large, since \n\nthey do not reflect an expected change in the near future. It reflects the results of one of the \n\nstrategies proposed to reduce anthropogenic CO2, i.e. the direct injection of anthropogenic \n\nCO2 into the deep ocean. The local CO2 concentration is expected to be as high as 20,000 \n\nppm and the pH below 5.8, what is expected to affect the water column; thus the effects on \n\nzooplankton and bacteria are of primary concern (Kurihara et al., 2004a). \n\nAcartia clausi (Mediterranean sea) under the realistic predicted values two of pH 7.83 and \n\ntemperature 20\u00b0C (+4\u00baC) exhibited egg production rate and hatching success decreased \n\nsignificantly over the duration of exposure at future pH under actual and future temperature \n\nconditions (Zervoudaki et al., 2013). Acidification does not have an obvious direct effect on \n\nthe vital rates of the copepod, with the exception of excretion possibly. Therefore, the \n\ncombination of acidification, ambient oligotrophic conditions and warming could affect the \n\nability of the species to allocate resources for coping with multiple stressors. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\n1.3.A different challenge for the marine zooplankton \n\nNatural CO2 vents have generated a substantial interest in recent years as in situ laboratories \n\nfor acidification studies. Field experiments, at sites with naturally-elevated CO2 conditions, \n\nare potentially useful analogues for investigating the effect of future dissolved CO2 levels on \n\nmarine organisms and ecosystems (Calosi et al., 2013, Kerrison et al., 2011). Some marine \n\nCO2 vents are at ambient seawater temperature and lack toxic sulphur compounds; such vents \n\ncan prevail for years to millennia and may be used to advance our understanding (Hall-\n\nSpencer et al., 2008). This opens a new door of opportunities at many levels, leaving behind \n\nmono-species studies under so restricted conditions for the zooplankton community, where \n\nthe interactions within and between species and with the environment cannot be addressed. \n\nThe existence of shallow water submarine volcanic ventis is well known off volcanic islands \n\nand provinces (Cardigos et al., 2005), occurring over a wide depth range, from the intertidal \n\nto the abyss. The deepest active hot vent known so far with associated fauna is the Ashadze \n\nfield located at 4000\u20134100 m depth at 12858V N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Tarasov et al., \n\n2005). Within submersed CO2 vents, it is important to distinguish between deep-sea \n\nhydrothermal vents and shallow-water vents. At deep-sea hydrothermal vents on mid-ocean \n\nridges there is usually a high biomass of largely endemic, but species poor, fauna that depends \n\non chemosynthesis-based production. By contrast, at less than 200 m depth, shallow-water \n\nvents tend to have a low biomass of a more diverse fauna with few, or no, endemic species \n\n(Cardigos et al., 2005). In addition, shallow water hydrothermal ecosystems are in the \n\neuphotic zone, i.e. there is primary production. Biological data have been published for \n\napproximately 55 deep-water and 21 shallow-water hydrothermal vent ecosystems (Tarasov et \n\nal., 2005) (figure 1.5). \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\n \nFigure 1.5.

Daily-variations can appear around the main points \n\n(Kerrison et al., 2011) as well as other gases and sulfides. Accordingly, analyses of gas \n\ncomposition, temperature, salinity and alkalinity acquire special relevance. \n\nPrevious studies on shallow-water vents consider a great diversity of groups, as bacteria \n\n(Cardigos et al., 2005; Brinkhoff et al., 1999, Kerfahi et al., 2014), benthic invertebrates \n\n(Cardigos et al., 2005; Calosi et al., 2013; Hall-Spencer et al., 2008; Gamenick et al., 1998; \n\nPettit et al., 2013), algae (Cardigos et al., 2005; Hall-Spencer et al., 2008), fishes (Cardigos et \n\nal., 2005) or seagrass (Hall-Spencer et al., 2008; Arnold et al., 2012), but only a recent study \n\nin the coast of Normanby Island (Papua New Guinea) take in count these environments to \n\nstudy possible effects on zooplankton communities. Smith et al. (2014) show that \n\nzooplankton abundance appears severely reduced in low pH waters compared to control sites. \n\nAs result of night samplings, zooplankton abundance appeared highest and the difference \n\nbetween pH sites was greater. Additionally, certain taxonomic groups were also reduced in \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n13 \n \n\nabundance in low pH waters. These results indicate that CO2 vents are optimal tools to \n\nmanifest acidification effects on these communities, and similar studies in others regions of \n\nthe world with implications to the trophic web assessments are of priority concern. \n\n1.4.Determining physiological status: RNA:DNA ratio \n\nStablish how environmental stressors affect marine organisms through determining its \n\nphysiological state has been among of the main aims of several studies. Within this \n\nframework, nucleic acid derived indices have been applied with success in microbial \n\ncommunities, invertebrates and fishes (Ch\u00edcharo &amp; Ch\u00edcharo, 2008), and RNA:DNA ratio \n\n(R:D) has particularly excelled. \n\nThe technique is based in the changes produced over the cellular concentration of RNA, \n\nwhich is highly dependent on growth rate, and indirectly on environmental conditions. On an \n\nindividual basis, DNA per somatic cell is assumed to be constant in sexually mature adults so \n\nthat the R:D ratio can be related to the magnitude of RNA transcription, protein synthesis and \n\nhence growth condition (Pommier et al., 2012). It was firstly proposed by Sutcliffe (1965), \n\nfollowed by Holm-Hansen et al. (1968), who suggest that the concentration of DNA would be \n\na good measure of living carbon in phytoplankton. \n\nTemperature is the dominant factor influencing copepod growth under adequate food \n\nsupplies; conversely, when the temperature range is narrow, food becomes the predominant \n\ndetermining factor for growth (Ch\u00edcharo &amp; Ch\u00edcharo, 2008). Nevertheless,  R:D interpretation \n\nis not always simple and direct. High R:D has been attributed in copepods to some type of \n\nstress that led to produce proteins to cope with stress-induced denaturation of other proteins \n\n(Vehma et al., 2012) and Pommier et al. (2012) found that the R:D of copepods was not \n\ncorrelated with DNA concentration, which suggested a spatial variability likely related to \n\nvariable growth conditions of the copepod population. R:D has not been considered a good \n\nindicator of somatic growth, since DNA is growth-dependent and there are confounding \n\nfactors related to the moult process; after a phase of hyperplasia (DNA proliferation) a phase \n\nof hypertrophy (protein assimilation) follows and hence the coupling of both processes \n\ndepends on the moulting rate (Yebra et al., 2011). For this reason, R:D appear as a good \n\nindicator of nutritional condition only in adult individuals. \n\nThis variability in the results suggests that even if R:D is a great methodology to assess \n\nphysiological state of the organisms, results have to be considered with precaution. \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n1.5.Aims \n\nThe present study is part of the project MOFETA (MOFETA - EXPL/MAR-EST/0604/2013), \n\nwhich general objective is investigating the ecological effects of ocean acidification in \n\nshallow water volcanic CO2 vents of the Azores. This multidisciplinary project is structured \n\naround the following objectives: 1. composition and quantification of the gases emitted in the \n\nsubmarine vents; 2. spatial variability of physical-chemical characteristics of seawater; 3. \n\nobservational study on planktonic assemblages; 4. observational study on macrobenthic \n\nassemblages; and 5. short-term manipulative field experiments with copepod assemblages. \n\nOnly the tasks related to zooplankton (3 and 5) will be developed here as follow:  \n\n1. Observational study on zooplanktonic assemblages \n\nDetermine if there are consistent differences in the abundance, diversity and composition of \n\nzooplankton assemblages between sites affected by CO2 emissions and control sites, without \n\nemissions. \n\nRelate the observed patterns in zooplankton assemblages in relation to the results of seawater \n\nchemistry and gas emissions. \n\nDescribe biochemical condition of major zooplanktonic groups using nucleic acids (growth \n\nand biomass indicators) and relate their ecophysiological status (RNA:DNA ratio) to possible \n\nstress caused by CO2. \n\n2. Short-term manipulative field experiments with copepod assemblages \n\nCompare the Egg Production Rates (EPR) of the most abundant copepod free-spawning \n\nspecies between sites affected by CO2 emissions and control sites, without emissions, to \n\nassess the possible effect of elevated CO2 concentrations on the EPR. \n\n\n\nMethodology  \n\n15 \n \n\n2. Methodology \n\n2.1.Study site \n\nThe study was conducted in the Azores archipelago, composed of nine volcanic islands \n\nlocalized in the mid-Atlantic ridge. Two active volcanic areas with submarine CO2 emissions, \n\none in the island of S\u00e3o Miguel and one in the island of Faial, were chosen for the purpose of \n\nthis study (figure 2.1). S\u00e3o Miguel and Faial were selected within the archipelago because of \n\nthe previous knowledge about the existence of submersed shallow-water CO2 vents in two \n\nspecific locations of these islands. Three sampling sites were selected within each island, two \n\nlocations along the gradient of CO2 emissions (Intermediate and Vent) and one Reference site, \n\nwith similar characteristics, but no degassing. Test dives and pH measurements with a CTD \n\nequipped with a pH probe (YSI6600) were the bases to select the Vent site (were the \n\nemissions were stronger) and two subsequent locations (Reference site and Intermediate \n\ngradient site) at a reasonable distance and with similar bottom geology and depth conditions. \n\n \nFigure 2.1. Sampling locations in the islands of Faial (A - Ponta da Espalamaca) and S\u00e3o Miguel (B - Ribeira \nQuente). \n\nIn S\u00e3o Miguel the Vent site (Ponta da Lobeira) was located in the south coast, close to the \n\nvillage of Ribeira Quente, in the flank of Furnas Volcano, between the Reference at Garajau \n\nand Intermediate site at Cov\u00f5es (figure 2.2). In Faial, the sampling sites were located in the \n\n\n\nMethodology  \n\n16 \n \n\nsoutheast of the Island; the Reference site at the exit of the Horta port, while the Vent and \n\nIntermediate sites were in front of Ponta da Espalamaca (figure 2.3). Conditions between both \n\nislands were very different, with the maximum depth of 10 meters at S\u00e3o Miguel, while at \n\nFaial it was 37 meters. Given their proximity to the Faial-Pico channel, the sites in Faial were \n\nstrongly exposed to tidal currents. The \u201cvent sites\u201d in both islands also differed in terms of \n\ntheir geological characteristics, since some of the emissions in S\u00e3o Miguel were warm while \n\nin Faial they were always cold. According to these characteristic they can been denominated \n\nas hot vents and cold seeps (Tarasov et al., 2005). \n\n \nFigure 2.2. Map with in situ measurements of surface pH (total scale) for the 3 locations sampled during the \n\nfield campaign in S. Miguel (03/07/2014-08/07/2014): Reference (37\u00ba43'39.097\"N 25\u00ba18'41.292\"W), \n\nIntermediate ((37\u00ba43'34.565\"N 25\u00ba19'41.635\"W) and Vent (37\u00ba43'28.736\"N 25\u00ba19'28.596\"W). \n\n\n\nMethodology  \n\n17 \n \n\n \nFigure 2.3. Map with in situ measurements of surface pH (total scale) for the 3 locations sampled during the \nfield campaign in Faial (10/07/2014-15/07/2014): Reference (38\u00ba32'20.184\"N 28\u00ba36'12.816\"W), Intermediate \n\n((38\u00ba32'31.74\"N 28\u00ba35'58.272\"W) and Vent (38\u00ba32'3.433\"N 28\u00ba36'56.855\"W). \n\n2.2.Seawater chemistry and gas composition \n\nOn each day of the sampling campaign, the physicochemical characteristics of the seawater \n\n(temperature, salinity and pH) were measured in situ, using a YSI6000 multiprobe. In addition \n\nto the in situ measurements, three water samples were collected at the surface (0-2m) and near \n\nthe bottom (6-10m in S\u00e3o Miguel and 15-38m in Faial) each site to be analyzed in the \n\nlaboratory and obtain the seawater carbonate chemistry variables. pH was measured in the \n\nlaboratory using a glass electrode (WTW, pH 340i) calibrated with a TRIS seawater buffer. \n\nTotal alkalinity was obtained through potentiometric titration, following Dickson et al. \n\n(2003), and using a Metrohm Titrino Plus 848 equipped with a 869 Compact Sample \n\nChanger, and calibrated with certified Reference material supplied by A. Dickson. Seawater \n\nsamples were filtered through a 0.2 \u00b5m membrane and measured within 48h. \n\nGas sampling was done in three patches of CO2 flow in each venting site (Ribeira Quente and \n\nPonta da Espalamaca), using Giggenbach bottles (bottles filled with NaOH 4N and under \n\nvaccum). Thus, acid gases dissolve in the basic solution and the more inert gases (non \n\nabsorbed) remain in the headspace of the bottle. Then, samples were analyzed in the \n\nlaboratories of CVARG (Centro de Vulcanologia e Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de Riscos Geol\u00f3gicos, \n\n\n\nMethodology  \n\n18 \n \n\nUniversity of Azores) through gas chromatography, potentiometric titration and colorimetric \n\ntitration techniques. Three replicates were collected in each area. \n\n2.3.Zooplankton assemblages \n\nMesozooplankton was sampled using oblique tows with a WP2 net \u00d860cm and 200 ?m mesh, \n\nequipped with a flow meter to determining the amount of water passing through the plankton \n\nnet, during 10 minutes and at approximately 2 knots. Five tows were effectuated at S\u00e3o \n\nMiguel at each station between days 3 and 7 of July, 2014. In Faial, a net with 500\u00b5m mesh \n\nwas used instead of the 200\u00b5m mesh used in S\u00e3o Miguel, since during the first sampling, the \n\nsmaller one was lost. Three tows in each station of Faial were conducted between days 10 and \n\n15 of July, 2014. Immediately after sampling, mesozooplankton was preserved in 4% borax \n\nbuffered formaldehyde. Another oblique tow with the same procedure was effectuated at each \n\nlocation to preserve mesozooplankton partially in RNA later for biochemical determinations \n\n(RNA:DNA ratio) and partially was kept alive for manipulative experiments (egg production \n\nrates). These tows were conducted with a modified cod end, without a mesh in order to collect \n\nthe organisms without much damage. \n\nThe total biovolume of each sample was determined by the method of displacement volume. \n\nSub-samples were obtained using a Folsom splitter and 300-500 organisms per sample were \n\ncounted and identified under a binocular microscope. The level of taxonomic resolution was \n\ndifferent among phyla. Inside Arthropoda, all organisms found in the samples belong to the \n\nsubphylum Crustacea, and resolution was higher than in the others phyla. Different life stages \n\nof Cirripedia (cyprid and nauplii), Copepoda (Nauplii), Euphausiacea (caliptopis, furcilia and \n\nnauplii), fish (eggs and larvae) and Coleoidea (eggs and larvae) were considered as different \n\ntaxa for every analysis. Pelagia noctiluca, despite not to be quantified and included in the \n\nanalysis since the sampling was not directed at these organisms which do not belong to \n\nmesozooplankton, appeared in some tows on the venting sites of S\u00e3o Miguel and Faial. \n\nA different approach was considered for a better description of the community and \n\ncomparison with other areas. As described in other studies (Shi et al., 2015, Sun et al., 2010), \n\nclassification of zooplankton functional groups can be based on the size of the zooplankton, \n\nfood preferences, trophic functionality, interactions between one another or relationships with \n\nhigher trophic levels. In this study, it was considered to separate Crustacean according with its \n\nsize (small, big and giant crustacean) since it was a dominant group in terms of abundance in \n\nS\u00e3o Miguel. Cnidaria, Mollusca, fish, Radiozoa e Tunicata were differentiated as independent \n\n\n\nMethodology  \n\n19 \n \n\nfunctional groups, while Annelida, Chaetognatha, Echinodermata and Foraminifera were \n\npooled as \u201cOthers\u201d since its abundance was too low in both islands. \n\n2.4.RNA:DNA ratio \n\nThe most abundant and well preserved taxa were used for the RNA:DNA analysis in each site \n\nof both S\u00e3o Miguel and Faial islands. Nucleic acids were obtained using a method based in \n\nthe microplate fluorescent assay (MFA) of Ikeda et al. (2007), which is a modification of the \n\nsequential fluorometric method of Bentle et al. (1981). Bentle et al. (1981) method is based \n\non the use of an ethidium bromide fluorometric technique, where the nucleic acids are \n\nsequentially degraded by nucleases (RNase and DNase). Wagner et al. (1998) modified the \n\nsequential fluorometric method to the MFA with 96-well microtiter plates by adopting a \n\nsarcosyl extraction technique and eliminating the DNase step, allowing the measurement of \n\nnucleic acids of several samples at the same time. \n\nPrior to the assay, a batch of 3 to 30 organisms were sorted depending on the taxa. \n\nZooplankton organisms were homogenized by sonication (3 pulses 50 A during 1 min) with \n\ncold sarcosyl extraction buffer. The volume of extraction buffer was between 100 and 200 ?l \n\n(0.5%). Then all samples were shaken for 30 minutes at room temperature using a vortex \n\nmixer equipped with a multiple-vial head. Afterwards, they were centrifuged (12 000 r.p.m, 0-\n\n4\u00baC) for 15 min to sediment any organism remain particle. The samples were diluted 1:10 \n\nwith Tris buffer to reduce the sarcosyl concentration to 0.05%.  In each run, duplicate 20-40 \n\n?l aliquots of supernatants of the samples and duplicates of 0, 1.1, 1.7 and 2.3 ?g ml\n\u20131\n\n DNA \n\nstandard solutions (?-phagus 0.25 mg ml\n\u20131\n\n from Roche) and 0, 7.3, 14.6 and 21.9 ?g ml\n\u20131\n\n \n\nRNA standard solutions (16s-23s E. coli 4 \u00b5g \u00b5l\n\u20131\n\n from Roche) were transferred to Nunclon \n\n96-well, black, round-bottom microplates. The ratio of DNA and RNA slopes was 8, which \n\ncan be used to compare RNA/DNA ratio results determined by other protocols (Caldarone et \n\nal., 2006). Gel Red solution (15 ?l) was added to each well, and the plates were shaken gently \n\nat room temperature. The fluorescence was then scanned after addition of the fluorescent dye \n\non a microplate reader (Biotek synergy HT model SIAFRTD) with 360 nm (excitation) and \n\n590 nm (emission) (first scan- total fluorescence RNA and DNA). Following the first scan, \n\nRNase solution (15 ?l, 0.12 \u00b5g ml-1) was added to each well and incubated at 37\u00baC for 30 \n\nminutes. The concentration of DNA was calculated directly by the standard curve. The \n\nconcentration of RNA was determined indirectly by subtraction of DNA fluorescence (second \n\nscan) from total fluorescence (first scan). The fluorescent dye used was Gel red solution. \n\n\n\nMethodology  \n\n20 \n \n\nMany protocols based upon this methodology used ethidium bromide (EB), which exhibits \n\nfluorescence when bound to nucleic acids (which gives the total nucleic acid concentration in \n\none reading). However in recent years EB has been largely replaced with alternatives like Gel \n\nRed, which are safer to use and exhibit the desired fluorescence when exposed to nucleic \n\nacids. \n\n2.5.Copepod Egg Production Rates (EPR) \n\nOblique tows, as described above were effectuated, but using a modified cod end, without \n\nmesh, in order to minimize damage to the organisms. As fast as was possible, the collected \n\nmaterial was introduced in the incubation chambers for that location (figure 2.4), and placed \n\nby divers 1 m above the sea bottom.A total of 18 chambers were placed at each Island, and the \n\ntime of incubation in S\u00e3o Miguel lasted 24h (3 replicates per site) and 72h (3 replicates per \n\nsite) while in Faial the six replicates per site were incubated for 72h. When removed, the \n\ncontent was preserved in lugol. Each PVC chamber had 38cm high and 10cm of diameter, \n\ndivided inside with a 500\u00b5m mesh in a superior part with 30cm and an inferior part with 8cm, \n\nin order to allow eggs fall down to avoid predation. Around the chambers there was a mesh \n\nwith 50 ?m, to maintain the eggs inside but allow exchange of seawater and smaller food \n\nparticles. For determining the Egg Production Rates (EPR) of copepods, eggs and nauplii \n\nwere considered over the total adult females. In S\u00e3o Miguel all individuals inside the \n\nchambers were identified as Paracalanus sp. and Clausocalanus sp., while in Faial calanoids \n\nas Centropages sp. and other harpacticoids species were identified. \n\n \nFigure 2.4. Incubation chambers for copepod EPR quantification. \n\n2.6.Data analyses \n\nPatterns of variation in zooplanktonic assemblage structure along the CO2 gradient in each \n\nisland were analyzed by multivariate statistical methods. Each Island (S\u00e3o Miguel and Faial) \n\n\n\nMethodology  \n\n21 \n \n\nwas considered independently, and two orthogonal factors were considered in the analyses: \n\nSite was considered a fixed factor with three levels corresponding to areas with different \n\nvolcanic CO2 emissions (Intermediate and Vent) and control areas, without emissions \n\n(Reference); Date was considered a random factor with 5 levels in S\u00e3o Miguel and 3 in Faial. \n\nStatistical differences among assemblages were tested using Permutational multivariate \n\nanalysis of variance (PERMANOVA) on Bray-Curtis similarities with untransformed \n\nabundances. The similarity percentages routine (SIMPER) was used to examine the \n\ncontribution of each taxon to average dissimilarities between sample groups. Ordination by \n\nnon-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) was used to visualize patterns in the biological \n\ndataset. \n\nAbundance (N), n\u00ba of taxa (S) and diversity (d) were calculated for the entire assemblage and \n\nfor the dominant phyla using RStudio version 3.1.2. (R Core Team, 2013), while eveness (J\u00b4) \n\nwas obtained with the DIVERSE routine on the PRIMER 6 statistical (PRIMER- E. Plymouth \n\nMarine Laboratory). Abundances and relative abundances of functional groups were as well \n\ncalculated using RStudio. Univariate analyses of variance (ANOVA) were used to test for \n\nstatistical differences in the taxa highlighted by the SIMPER routine, abundances, n\u00ba of taxa, \n\ndiversity indices, secondary production (egg production rate) and biovolume of samples. \n\nDifferences between means have been considered statistically significant for p&lt;0.05. \n\nHomogeneity of variances was previously tested with the Bartlett test, and pair-wise tests for \n\ngroup means were done a posteriori on significant effects. Statistical analyses and data \n\nrepresentation were done using RStudio. \n\n\n\nResults \n\n22 \n \n\n3. Results \n\n3.1.Seawater chemistry and gas composition \n\npH varied along the water column according with figure 3.1. In S\u00e3o Miguel, pH decreased \n\nunder 7.0 in the Vent site near to the bottom and in the surface, while in the Intermediate and \n\nReference sites, lowest values appeared nearest to the surface, about 7.6 and 8.0 respectively. \n\nIn Faial, pH varied similarly in Vent and Intermediate sites, being under 7.0 in the bottom, \n\nwhile in the Reference it oscillated from 7.85 to 8.15 along the water column. The water \n\ncolumn in S\u00e3o Miguel varied from 10 m in the Reference and Intermediate sites to 7m in the \n\nVent, while in Faial it was almost 40 m in the Intermediate and Vent, and 30 m in the \n\nReference site. \n\n \nFigure 3.1. pH variation along the water column in three sites: Reference (Ref), Intermediate (Int) and Vent \n(Vnt) of S\u00e3o Miguel (a, b, c) and Faial (d, e, f). \n\nFigure 3.2 shows the pH and temperature values frequency in S\u00e3o Miguel (11a-b) and Faial \n\n(11c-d). In both islands, highest values of pH were constant through the three sites, while \n\nlowest values appeared only in the venting site, and Intermediate was between both. \n\nTemperature scarcely varied.

The water column was \n\nsampled at the surface (0-2m) and bottom (10m in S\u00e3o Miguel and 38m in Faial). In S\u00e3o \n\nMiguel island, temperature and salinity did not vary significantly from bottom to surface and \n\namong sites (19.79 to 20.67\u00baC, 36.78 to 36.92ppt), only minimum temperature in the bottom \n\nincreased minimally from Reference to Vent. pH decreased gradually from the Reference to \n\nthe Vent site in the surface, while in the bottom, the Intermediate value did not follow this \n\npattern. In Faial, salinity only increased in the surface 0.21 ppt from the Reference to the \n\nVent, and temperature did not vary between sites; there were some grades of difference from \n\nbottom to surface due to a thermocline (ref-1.53\u00baC, int-1.4\u00baC, vnt-2.39\u00baC).

The only exception was the diversity of Arthropoda (F \n\nvalue=8.35, p=0.02) (annex 7.7).

Discussion \n\n4.1.Seawater chemistry and gas composition \n\nCarbon dioxide was the dominant gas in the submarine degassing areas of Espalamaca (Faial) \n\nand Ponta da Lobeira (S. Miguel) with values consistently exceeding 98%. The low \n\nconcentrations of toxic gases such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) entails an additional advantage \n\nto the, since they would be confounding factors in the interpretation of the results. \n\nAccordingly, from the perspective of the composition of gas emissions, both these sites can be \n\nconsidered suitable for long-term studies on the effects of ocean acidification. \n\nS\u00e3o Miguel and Faial where the two islands considered in our study as clear example of \n\nresponse to ocean acidification, but despite of their proximity, differences in their physical \n\ncharacteristics prevented the direct comparison of the zooplankton communities found in \n\nthem. Even more important, their comparison in this study was not possible due to mesh size \n\nof the nets used in the sampling (200 \u00b5m in S. Miguel and 500 \u00b5m in Faial). \n\nIn S\u00e3o Miguel island, salinity did not vary among sites and the small increase in bottom \n\ntemperature from Reference to Vent is probably due to the smaller deep in the Vent site \n\n(figures 10 and 11). Thus, main differences between sites are due to changes in CO2 and pH \n\nlevels. Punctual measurements in table 3.1 generally show higher values of CO2 near the \n\nbottom, relative to the surface and this trend is more pronounced at the Vent site.  As showed \n\nin figure 1.2, actual values of CO2 pressure at the ocean surface are estimated in 380 \u00b5atm. In \n\nS\u00e3o Miguel, 388.67 \u00b5atm was considered the Reference value since there was no bubbling \n\nwhere it was measured. It increases to 483.37 in the Intermediate and to 983.10 in the Vent, \n\nshowing a gradient within the range of the Representative Concentration Pathways in the \n\nlatest IPCC assessment report (AR5), varying between 421 (RCP2.6) and 936 (RCP8.5) ppm \n\nCO2. Accordingly results at the Vent site should be considered as representatives of the more \n\nextreme scenario at the end of this century. This corresponded to pH decrease from 8.06 to \n\n7.75 (0.31 units), which is also within the range predicted by 2100 (0.3/0.4 units) (Fitzer et \n\nal., 2012; Dupont &amp; Thorndyke, 2009; Havenhand, 2012). \n\nThe CO2 is bubbled from the bottom and dissolved in the waters around the venting sites and \n\nprobably expelled to the air, resulting in chemical changes that are within a range expected \n\naccording to current projections of future atmospheric CO2 levels. The pH values observed at \n\nthe Vent site are definitively more realistic than those used in some of the previous \n\n\n\nDiscussion \n\n37 \n \n\nmanipulative experiments carried out in controlled conditions (annex 7.1). As presented in \n\nfigure 3.2, median and minimum values of pH decrease to the Vent site, but higher values are \n\nrepresented in the three sites. pH values are vertically distributed along the water column \n\n(figure 3.1), with the lower values being generally observed in the surface, except at the Vent \n\nsite where very low values were also observed near the bottom. This suggests a natural \n\ngradient could exist if CO2 is bubbled and concentrated in the surface before to be released to \n\nthe atmosphere where the concentration is generally lower. In fact, pCO2 is greatest at the \n\nsurface in all sites, however, most of the pH measurements were done near the bottom or at \n\nthe surface, which may have biased the results for the Intermediate levels of the water \n\ncolumn, which were less represented. \n\nFaial shows totally different characteristics from S\u00e3o Miguel. The water column goes to 38m \n\nand the strong currents between Faial and Pico islands (figure 2.1) make the selected areas do \n\nnot have the same insulation and stability than in S\u00e3o Miguel. It was already reported by \n\nCaramanna et al. (2010) that the volume of the water affected by chemical variations is \n\ninfluenced by local conditions, such as the presence of thermocline and currents. This led to a \n\nlower water residence time and faster dissipation of the CO2 gradient (Agostini et al., 2015). \n\nIt has been proposed by Agostini et al. (2015) that a mapping of pH levels and a longer pH \n\nmonitoring would led to a better delimitation of the areas affected for the venting activity. \n\nWhat was appreciated from the data recorded with the probe during dives was a fast \n\ndissipation of the pH gradient not only vertically, but also horizontally, making difficult the \n\nassessment of the effects of the venting activity on moving animals. As it can be clearly \n\nappreciated in figure 3.1, CO2 bubbles were totally dissolved in the water column before they \n\nreach the surface (which did not occur in S\u00e3o Miguel), where the values are normal. pH at the \n\nReference site varies along the water column, within a range of higher values (7.85-8.15). \n\nValues of pH lower than 7 were registered in the Vent and until 7 in the Intermediate, forming \n\na gradient in the selected areas (figure 3.2). Values on table 3.2 show a pH decreasing in the \n\nbottom, while surface pH is constant across sites. Bottom pCO2 increased to the Vent, and the \n\ndissipation in surrounding waters led to similar values in the surface than in the bottom of the \n\nReference site. This is because the water column exerts a great influence on the dissipation of \n\nthe gradient despite the pCO2 values in the bottom being stronger than in S\u00e3o Miguel (894.08 \n\n\u00b5mol/kgSW in Faial vs 742.50 in S\u00e3o Miguel). This needs to be considered for the \n\ninterpretation of the results in this and future studies. In fact, the intensity and extent of the \n\nCO2 gradient in Faial are strongly influenced by the hydrological conditions (depth, currents, \n\n\n\nDiscussion \n\n38 \n \n\nthermocline), so it is more likely to affect benthic communities than the planktonic and \n\npelagic communities. \n\n4.2.Zooplankton assemblages \n\nCopepods were the most abundant component of zooplankton in S\u00e3o Miguel, being calanoids \n\nas Paracalanus parvus or Centropages typicus the main species (annex 7.2). Along with \n\ncladocerans as Evadne spinifera, they lead to the dominance of the phylum Arthropoda \n\n(figure 3.3). Athropoda and Chordata present a significantly greater abundance at the venting \n\nsite in S\u00e3o Miguel. The functional groups approach allowed discern between small, big and \n\ngiant crustacean all the taxa inside Arthropoda and Tunicata and fish inside Chordata. Thus, \n\nanalyses identified small crustacean and Tunicata as the only groups with significant \n\nincreased abundance in the Vent site. Oikopleuridae was the main representative of tunicates, \n\nand its increased abundance goes according with previous studies concerning gelatinous \n\nzooplanktonic components. This positive correlation of appendicularians with acidification \n\nconditions was already manifested in a mesocosm-scale study on the effects of temperature, \n\npCO2 and bloom structures on the appendicularian Oikopleura dioica (Troedsson et al., \n\n2013), with an increase on populations, either for a positive regulation of a low pH or for a \n\nnegative effect of an increased pH. Abundance was positively correlated with increased pCO2, \n\ntemperature and nutrient levels, consistent with hypotheses concerning gelatinous \n\nzooplankton in future oceans. Thus, results in this study suggest that appendicularians will \n\nplay more important roles in marine pelagic communities and vertical carbon transport under \n\nprojected ocean acidification and elevated temperature scenarios. These species ingest \n\nsmaller-sized particles than copepods, by-passing the microbial loop by directly transferring \n\nbacteria and nanoplankton to higher trophic levels, and they are vectors of global vertical \n\ncarbon flux through trapping of prey in their frequently discarded houses (Troedsson et al., \n\n2013). Pelagia noctiluca was not included in the analysis but its occurrence only in the Vent \n\nsites on both islands does not seem like causality. Future sampling campaigns in these areas \n\nincluding a task leaded to these macrozooplankton components would bring more specific and \n\nuseful information. \n\nOn the other hand, some species of arthropods as the cladocera Evadne spinifera, or copepods \n\nas Paracalanus parvus increase their abundance drastically in the Vent site, while richness, \n\ndiversity and eveness are not significantly different among sites (annex 7.6). These species \n\ndominate in all sites, therefore the environmental differences in the Intermediate and Vent \n\n\n\nDiscussion \n\n39 \n \n\nsites are benefiting the zooplanktonic community. In fact, PERMANOVA analysis reflects \n\nthese differences among sites and highlights the stability of the study sites since there are not \n\nsignificant differences among collection dates. Differences in the species composition were \n\nreported in other studies. Cooke et al. (2006) reported higher abundance of calanoid adults, \n\ncyclopoids, and Conochilus spp., a planktonic rotifer in the acidic and oligotrophic freshwater \n\nlake Giles in northeastern Pennsylvania. Aglaodiaptomus spatulocrenatus egg ratios, Cyclops \n\nscutifer egg ratios, and nauplii were also significantly higher at the high pH, whereas Daphnia \n\ncatawba egg ratios were significantly higher at the low pH. These results are not conclusive to \n\npH responses because they are combining the effects of DOM, UV and pH. However, it leads \n\nthem to hypothesize that against changes in the seawater chemical composition, some species \n\nwill be more benefit than others. Thus, in an open system with acidified and non-acidified \n\nareas, some differences in the species composition could be expected. Nevertheless, our \n\nresults showed no differences in the species composition, only the reported increase in the \n\nabundances of some taxa. Results on n\u00ba of species, diversity and evenness among sites in both \n\nislands have to be considered along with the different resolution levels in the taxonomy, since \n\nfor example Arthropoda has been more developed than Cnidaria, increasing the probabilities \n\nto find statistical differences in these indexes. \n\nThe nMDS in S\u00e3o Miguel shows a clear clustering of sites, with only some dates overlapped. \n\nReference and Intermediate sites seem to have characteristics more like each other than with \n\nVent. The nMDS shows the affinity of P.parvus, E.spinifera and Radiozoa for the venting \n\nconditions, while Cirripedia nauplii show preference for areas not acidified. Previous studies \n\nfocused on the larval stage of barnacles do not report this effect. For example, Amphibalanus \n\namphitrite showed no affection in the early life phases under a pH of 7.4 (McDonald et al., \n\n2009); and a population model of Semibalanus balanoides using empirical data showed that a \n\ndecreasing on pH from 8.2 to 7.8 only get a significant affect below a critical temperature \n\n(Findlay et al., 2010). Cirripedia together with P.parvus and E.spinifera are characterized for \n\na calcium carbonate external body, being more likely affected by acidification, but since the \n\nearly developmental stages of many marine species are suspected to be most sensitive \n\n(Dupont &amp; Thorndyke, 2009; Kroeker et al., 2010; Cripps et al., 2014), Cirripedia on its \n\nplanktonic life stage could have lower resistance. Paracalanus parvus and Evadne spinifera, \n\nas representative species of the community, have highlighted their apparent resilience under \n\nhigh CO2 conditions. Most of the previous studies in copepods (annex 7.1), showed no effect \n\non the survival of these organisms under controlled conditions of decreased pH. Detrimental \n\n\n\nDiscussion \n\n40 \n \n\neffects of CO2 were only detected during the early stages, as the egg production and the \n\nhatching success seem to be affected. Havenhand (2012), on his study on the Baltic Sea key \n\nfunctional groups, said that it is expected that copepods will be resilient to near-future ocean \n\nacidification (?1000 \u00b5atm CO2). He explains that the extreme pCO2 levels used in \n\nexperiments elicited little or no response, and that the relatively rapid generation times of \n\ncopepods confers a high potential for adaptability. Nevertheless, as Mayor et al. (2012) \n\nconcluded, there is a context-dependency that highlights the need for cautious interpretation \n\nand application of data from individual climate-change studies. Copepods, as a group, may be \n\nwell equipped to deal with the chemical changes associated with ocean acidification, \n\nhowever, long-term exposures examining the synergistic effects of ocean acidification with \n\nother climate stressors, particularly warming on population viability and success, have yet to \n\nbe conducted (Weidmann et al., 2012). \n\nOn the other hand, Radiozoa was the only taxa with low representation in the Reference and \n\nIntermediate sites, and a peak of abundance in the Vent, showing high tolerance to low pH \n\nand thus a fitness advantage over less resistant organisms. Increased abundance of the overall \n\nzooplanktonic community in the venting site, were pH conditions are suboptimal, entails an \n\nadaptation capacity of many predominant groups, and regression of rarer species. Thereby, the \n\nmost abundant species in the community are the main contributors to the differences among \n\nsites and have higher abundance in the venting sites, while Cirripedia nauplii decrease under \n\nacidification conditions, as others groups with low occurrence. Radiozoa was not a dominant \n\ngroup in the Reference and Intermediate sites, but it was the third group most abundant in the \n\nVent. It can be a direct link between the high CO2 concentration in the water and the \n\nchlorophyll content in the Radiozoa cells. As them, phytoplankton would be benefited by the \n\nventing emissions, and it could explain the higher zooplankton abundance. Only organisms \n\nwithout resistance for these conditions would not proliferate in these environments. \n\nIn Faial, Radiozoa acquires more importance in terms of abundance (figure 3.4), while \n\ngelatinous components as siphonophorous are responsible for the high biovolume in the \n\nsamples (figure 3.7). There is not a tendency in the abundance of the organisms with the CO2 \n\ngradient; most of the taxa increase in the Intermediate site, where the total abundance is \n\nhigher. Only Arthropoda diversity decreases significantly with the CO2 concentration. In fact, \n\nthe PERMANOVA analysis shows how there are no significant differences between sites, but \n\nthere are differences between sampling dates. Thus, the nMDS relates each of the taxa \n\nhighlighted in the SIMPER analysis with a different date. It reveals the unstable conditions in \n\n\n\nDiscussion \n\n41 \n \n\nFaial, which are manifested among the different sampling days. Since the CO2 gradient is \n\ncompletely dissolved in the vicinity of the emissions, and its effect is not discernible in the \n\nremainder water column, this area is led suitable to test the acidification effect on the \n\nplanktonic and pelagic communities than the Lobeira site in S. Miguel. In the same line, the \n\ndifferences in the diversity of arthropods among sites cannot be justified with the CO2 levels \n\nconsidering that these organisms are distributed along the water column. \n\n4.3.RNA:DNA ratio \n\nThe physiological state of some organisms was tested through the RNA:DNA technique to \n\nevaluate if the increased CO2 was affecting the main groups found at each site. Since the \n\npattern was not consistent among the groups analyzed, there was not measurable effect on the \n\nphysiological or nutritional state of the communities. A visible effect on fish larvae could be \n\nexpected as described by Franke &amp; Clemmesen (2011), which found a negative relation \n\nbetween pCO2 and RNA:DNA ratio in hatched herrings. Nevertheless, they considered as \n\ncontrol a pCO2 of 480 \u00b5atm and a treatment pCO2 of 4635 \u00b5atm, which are values much \n\nhigher than in this study and exceeding the forecasts for the end of the century. All samples \n\nwere collected with little time of difference on the same day, so the daily variation of the \n\nindex exposed by Chicharo &amp; Chicharo (2008) for different species (ex. Sardina pichardus, \n\nSciaenops ocellatus, Ruditapes decussatus, Ceratoderma edule) could not be the factor of \n\nvariation here. However, it could be due to the non-selection of only adult organisms and \n\nfrom the same sex. RNA per unit dry weigth can be greater in females and DNA per unit dry \n\nweight greater in males, due to sexual dimorphism or physiological and behavioural \n\ndifferences (Chicharo et al., 2007). Catarino et al. (2012) also found a higher RNA/DNA ratio \n\nin females than males of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, which is attributed to ovaries \n\nhaving a higher energetic demand than testis. This effect could be avoided if only individuals \n\nfrom the same sex were selected or having a balanced same sex ratio in the samples. \n\nIncreasing the number of replicates, by performing more tows per site during different days \n\ncould also contribute to consolidate the results. \n\n4.4.Copepod Egg Production Rates (EPR) \n\nPrevious studies calculated the egg hatching rate of different copepod species at in situ \n\nconditions (Andersen &amp; Nielsen, 1997). Escaravage &amp; Soetaert (1993) define hatching as the \n\nmoment when at least 50% of the eggs have hatched, and Andersen &amp; Nielsen (1997) \n\nconsider a 100% hatching criterion. Here, we define hatching rate as the number of eggs \n\n\n\nDiscussion \n\n42 \n \n\nreleased and nauplii hatched in relation to the number of females in the sample. The nauplii \n\nproduced were taken into consideration because the hatching of eggs can be produced during \n\nthe time of the experiment and otherwise, the egg production would be underestimated \n\n(Andersen &amp; Nielsen, 1997). In other methodologies, the capture and transport of copepods, \n\nas well as the change of the natural conditions as temperature or feeding, may cause a \n\nvariation in the natural rates. This is the reason why incubation chambers were prepared and \n\nthe experiment was carried out in the field with freshly caught copepods. \n\nAs in many experiments under controlled conditions, the egg production rate of copepods \n\ndecreased under acidification conditions in S\u00e3o Miguel, but not with the different exposure \n\ntimes. Bottom pH levels in table 3.1 are quite similar with the conditions of the incubation \n\nchambers (8.07, 8.11 and 7.87 in S\u00e3o Miguel; 8.13, 8.02 and 7.88 in Faial). In previous \n\nstudies (annex 7.1), the egg production rate and/or hatching rate were tested under controlled \n\nconditions and there was an effect of decreasing pH. Most of them were obtained for pH \n\nunder 7, only Cripps et al. (2014) found a decreasing on Acartia tonsa for a pH of 7.8 and \n\nThor &amp; Dupont (2015) on Pseudocalanus acuspes for a pH of 7.75. Conditions of higher pH \n\nshowed no significant effect. Considering that the lower pH level measured at the bottom was \n\n7.75 (table 3.1), this is one of these few studies that reports a significant decreasing under \n\nrealistic near future conditions, and the first one that report it in a natural environment and is \n\nnot species-specific. In addition, values in table 3.1 do not correspond exactly with the \n\nlocation of the chambers, first because measurements and chambers placement were not done \n\nat the same time and second because chambers were accompanied by a buoy that kept them \n\nfloating vertically approximately one meter above the substrate. It may have led to an even \n\nhigher pH since as showed in figure 9, pH tends to increase away from the bottom until the \n\nsurface, where decrease again only in S\u00e3o Miguel. \n\nGenerally, chambers were a good methodology to evaluate secondary production in the \n\nnatural environment, as their design was in line with their functionality. After 24 or 72h \n\nunderwater, and despite the strong currents in Faial, only one chamber at the Vent site in S\u00e3o \n\nMiguel was lost during the 72h period. Nevertheless, the decreasing in the EPR in Faial was \n\nnot significant. This was probably due to the highest mesh size used in this island, since \n\ncopepods were not a component of zooplankton as abundant as in S\u00e3o Miguel. It has to be a \n\nconsideration for future experiments, as well as control the quantity of copepods introduced in \n\nthe chambers to improve the results. Thus, from the six chambers used at each site in Faial, \n\nthree of them did not contain copepods, having been missed. Furthermore, the chambers with \n\n\n\nDiscussion \n\n43 \n \n\ncopepods had 1.44\u00b13.94 (mean\u00b1SD) individuals, while in S\u00e3o Miguel they were more \n\nabundant (3.94\u00b14.35 (mean\u00b1SD) individuals). This loss of replicates was reflected in the \n\nanalysis, as the degrees of freedom differ from 11 residuals in S. Miguel (table 7) to only 6 in \n\nFaial (table 3.8). Keeping the same methodology, it would be easily solved in future \n\nexperiments increasing the volume of inoculum introduced into the chambers. \n\nThe methodology used was intended to minimize the stress produced in the individuals that \n\nwould affect the results, so the content of the tows was directly introduced in the chambers, \n\nwith no previous selection of a fix number of females. Given the low abundances used, the \n\nspecies inside the chambers do not represent the complete zooplanktonic communities found \n\nin these sites. Andersen &amp; Nielsen (1997) performed their experiments with 3-6 females in \n\n600ml bottles, which is much more concentrated than in our case. Thus, it should avoid \n\ncannibalism and predation during the short time experiment but allow hatching of the eggs. \n\nNevertheless, the fact of these factors be present would reduce the egg hatching rates, but it \n\nwould be constant over sites.  Also, the semi-permeable chambers allow the exchange of \n\ndissolved materials (including oxygen and CO2), while allowing the exclusion of larger \n\npredators.\n\n\n\nConclusions \n\n44 \n \n\n5. Conclusions \n\nIn the present study, two new natural shallow-water CO2 vents in S\u00e3o Miguel and Faial \n\nislands were characterized as in situ laboratories for ocean acidification investigations. It was \n\ndemonstrated their suitability for investigating the effect of future dissolved CO2 levels in the \n\ncommunities of the NE Atlantic. \n\nDifferences in the total abundance of mesozooplankton among sites in S\u00e3o Miguel were \n\nreported, as well as in the abundances of small crustaceans and Tunicata. Only differences in \n\nthe diversity of Arthropoda were found in Faial. PERMANOVA illustrated the differences in \n\nthe composition of the zooplanktonic assemblages among sites in S\u00e3o Miguel and among \n\ndates in Faial. The main contributors to these differences in the first case highlighted by the \n\nSIMPER routine, were Evadne spinifera, Paracalanus parvus, Cirripedia nauplii and \n\nRadiozoa. Through the nMDS analysesm Radiozoa, Paracalanus parvus and Evadne \n\nspinifera appeared more related to vent conditions, while Cirripedia nauplii was closer to the \n\nreference conditions. In Faial, the main contributors were Bassia bassensis, Radiozoa and \n\nScyphozoa ephyra. Conditions in this island did not allow a division among sites in the nMDS \n\nanalyses, since the strong currents mix the water, dissipating the effect of the gas emissions, \n\nand variation among days becomes more important and statistically observable. \n\nRNA:DNA did not show a clear pattern of variation, only copepods in S\u00e3o Miguel and \n\ncladocerans in Faial had an higher ratio in the Reference, but with no gradual decrease to the \n\nVent. Fish eggs seem to have an inverted pattern. Egg Production Rate showed a decreasing \n\ntrend along the CO2 gradient in S\u00e3o Miguel, with no differences in the exposure time. In \n\nFaial, it was higher in the Reference, but it did not differ significantly. \n\n\n\nReferences \n\n45 \n \n\n6.
