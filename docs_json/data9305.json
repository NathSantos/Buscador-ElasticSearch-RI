The implants were evaluated by RFA, by \nmeasuring the bone height, and peri-implant bone density.

Rev Odontol UNESP. 2017 Nov-Dec; 46(6): 319-324320\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDental implants have been used predictably for the treatment \nof all forms of edentulism1,2. However, anatomical conditions such \nas bone atrophy create technical difficulties for the installation of \nimplants of a conventional size3,4.\n\nTechniques such as guided bone regeneration, inlay block grafts5, \nsinus floor augmentation6, osteodistraction7, and lateralization of \nthe inferior alveolar nerve8 have been proposed for individuals with \ndecreased bone height and thickness to allow for placement of a \nconventionally sized implant. These techniques are more complex \nand are rarely accepted by patients due to risks such as increased \nmorbidity, surgical time and the extra costs for implant-supported \nrehabilitation9,10.\n\nOne alternative that has been proposed is the use of short implants \nthat would have the advantage of eliminating additional surgical \nprocedures to increase bone availability following installation of \nthe implants6,11. A literature review reports that previous studies \nhave shown that the use of short implants had a high failure \nrate compared to conventional implants12. However, with the \nimprovement of engineering materials, there have been changes \nin the external/internal design and the surface of the implant that \nhave allowed treatment with short implants to obtain success rates \nsimilar to the use of conventional implants6. In addition, there is also \ncontradictory information regarding success rates (e.g. prosthetic \ncomplications, marginal bone loss) of short implants. One study \nshowed that success rates of short implants installed in the posterior \nregion of the jaws were 65.2% after a follow up of 16 to 57 months, \nwhich is lower than expected for conventional implants in this same \ntype of situation13. On the other hand, a clinical study that evaluated \nthe success rates of short and conventional implants placed in fully \nedentulous mandibles and followed up for 12 months showed an \nequal success rates for these both types of implants14.\n\nConsidering that short implants may interfere with the success \nand survival of the oral rehabilitation, the aim of this study was \nto evaluate and compare the values of radiographic bone density, \nperi-implant bone height and resonance frequency analysis of short \nand conventional implants installed in the posterior region of the \nmandible after installation of the temporary implant-supported \nprosthesis.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHOD\n\nPatient Selection\n\nThis prospective parallel study was approved by the Ethics \nCommittee on Human Research (1302/11) and was conducted in \naccordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients were asked \nrespectfully to participate in this study and signed an informed \nconsent before they were included in the study.\n\nEleven patients were selected for this study. Eight of them were \nfemale and three were male, and the mean age of participants was \n53.44 years. The exclusion criteria adopted for this study were \n1)\u00a0presence of systemic alterations; 2) chronic use medications that \n\nalter bone metabolism; 3) smoking; 4) alcoholism; and 5) presence \nof parafunctional habits.\n\nTwo types of implants were placed in these patients, and the \nselection was defined according to the tomographic analysis of \nthe posterior region of the mandible: Group I: Short Implants \n(5.0 x 5.5 mm and 5.0 x 7.0 mm); Group II: Conventional implants \n(4.0 x 10 mm and 4.0 x 11.5 mm). The short implants were placed \nin areas with a distance from the alveolar crest to the upper wall \nof the mandibular canal of less than 11.5 mm (Short, Conex\u00e3o \nimplant Systems), whereas the conventional implants were installed \nin areas where this distance exceeded 11.5 mm (Master Grip, \nConex\u00e3o implant Systems). All the implants were installed by the \nsame operator.\n\nProsthetic Rehabilitation\n\nAll patients received a provisional prosthesis for four months \nafter the implant placement. Micro-Unit abutments were installed \nto permit the connection of multiple screw-retained prostheses \n(Conex\u00e3o implant Systems). The provisional acrylic prostheses \nwere fitted using Micro Unit intermediaries. All the prostheses \nwere installed by the same operator.\n\nRadiographic Analysis (Bone Level and Density)\n\nThe radiographic analyses were performed using a digital \nperiapical radiograph of each implant (Gendex?). A device made \nof acrylic resin (Figure\u00a01A) (Jet Cl\u00e1ssico) was used to standardize \nthe radiographic position to ensure the cone of the X-ray apparatus \nwas perpendicular to the digital film, which eventually became \nparallel to the long axis of the implant (Figure\u00a01B-F). All radiographs \nwere performed using the same X-ray device (Gnatus) with the \nsame exposure parameters: 65-90 Kv, 7.5-10 mA and a controlled \ntime of 0.2s.\n\nFor the analysis of peri-implant bone level, the images were \ngraded according to the length of the implant, and the measurements \nwere made using the superior portion of the implant platform as a \nreference point for the bone contact with the implant body. Regarding \nthe analysis of the bone density, five areas with 20x20 pixels were \ndefined, four of them were delimited to the side regions of the \nimplant (coronal and the middle third region of the implants) and \nthe implant body (Figure\u00a01G). The radiographic density calculations \nwere performed using the average gray levels of the regions of interest, \nwhich were defined from the implant gray tone to compensate for \nminor differences between x-rays because the density of the metallic \npattern of the implant was the same in all samples. Radiographs \nwere assessed at periods T0 (immediately after installation of the \ninterim), T1 (after 90 days) and T2 (after 180 days). These analyses \nwere performed using image analysis software (Image J, National \nInstitutes of Health) by a single calibrated examiner.\n\nResonance Frequency Analysis (RFA)\n\nThe RFA was made with an Osstell? apparatus (Osstell), which \nis an apparatus using transducers connected to the implant or \nprosthetic components available for many systems. The transducers \n(smartpegs) induce a lateral force to the fixed components, and the \n\n\n\nRev Odontol UNESP. 2017 Nov-Dec; 46(6): 319-324 Clinical comparison of short... 321\n\ndisplacement of the system is measured. The value obtained with \nthe Osstell? was automatically translated into an implant stability \nquotient (ISQ) that ranged from 1 to 100. The smartpeg A3, which is \ncoupled to the system unit with torque from 4 to 6 N.cm, was used \nfor this evaluation. The measurements were made in the mesial, \ndistal, buccal and lingual areas, and the average of these values was \nconsidered the final value for RFA for each implant.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nThe numerical data of all the parameters analyzed in this study \nwere subjected to a Shapiro-Wilk normality test (p> 0.05), which \ndetermined the application of parametric tests for inferential \nanalysis. The unpaired t-test was used to compare the different \ntypes of implants in each evaluation period, whereas the repeated \nmeasurements one-way ANOVA test was used to assess intra-group \ndata. Additionally, the Pearson correlation test was used to evaluate \nthe correlation of bone density, bone level and RFA data. GraphPad \nPrism 5 software was used to perform statistical analysis, and all \ntests were applied with a confidence level of 95% (p&lt;0.05).\n\nRESULT\n\nA total of 41 implants were installed in 11 patients. Of this \ntotal, 18 were short implants and 23 were conventional implants. \nNo implants were lost during the evaluation period of this study.\n\nBone Density\n\nIn the analysis of the bone radiographic density, no statistically \nsignificant differences between the groups were detected for any of \nthe evaluated periods. There were also no differences among the \ngroups for the different periods of evaluation. Even by segmenting \nthe evaluation of bone radiographic density into cortical and \nmedullary areas, there were not statistically significant between-group \ndifferences in any of the evaluation periods. Within the group with \n\nconventional implants, there was a reduction in bone radiographic \ndensity in the period T1 compared to the period T0 (p&lt;0.05). \nThe\u00a0average and standard deviation data of the radiographic density \nanalysis for all of the groups is included in Table\u00a01.\n\nBone Level\n\nAnalysis of the bone level showed that the short implants had \na lower distance between the implant platform and the bone crest \ncompared to conventional implants for all of the evaluation periods \n(1.87-1.95 mm for conventional implants vs. 0.51-0.68 mm for \nshort implants) (p&lt;0.05). Additionally, there were no intra-group \ndifferences regarding bone level variation during the experimental \nperiod. However, the variation of the bone loss between the \ngroups were not different (0.05 mm at T1 and 0.03mm at T2 for \nconventional implants vs. -0.08 mm at T1 and -0.17 mm at T2 for \nshort implants). Table\u00a01 shows the average and standard deviation \nof the bone level (mm) for all of the groups.\n\nRFA\n\nThe RFA showed that the conventional implants (66.76 \u00b1 10.39) \npresented greater stability values compared to the short implants \n(57.50 \u00b1 12.17) during the T0 period (p&lt;0.05). However, this \ndifference was not detected in other periods. Regarding the \nintra-group analysis, there was a reduction in the stability of \nconventional implants in the T2 period compared to the T1 period \n(p&lt;0.05) and an increase in stability of the short implant in the \nT1 period compared to the T0 period (p&lt;0.01). Table\u00a01 shows the \naverage and standard deviation of the RFA for all of the groups.\n\nCorrelations\n\nA negative correlation was found between the bone level and \nRFA data in the conventional implant group T0 period (p = 0.04). \nWith respect to the correlation between the bone level and bone \n\nFigure 1.

For the correlation data between the bone radiographic \ndensity and the RFA, a negative correlation was detected for short \nimplants only detected in period T1 (p = 0.04). Table\u00a02 shows the \nvalues of the correlations performed in this study.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nAreas with severe bone resorption and limitations in bone \nheight and thickness represent a challenge for oral rehabilitation \nwith dental implants11,14, especially in the posterior regions of the \nmandible and maxilla where the mandibular canal and maxillary \nsinus floor are located6,15. Short implants have emerged as a less \ntraumatic and invasive alternative than reconstructive procedures \nwith bone grafts6,14,15. However, despite the good predictability and \nhigh success rate of bone grafting procedures, patients are often \nreluctant to undergo additional surgeries because of the risks and \nmorbidity associated with them15.\n\nLoss of implants after the installation of the provisional \nimplant-supported prosthesis did not occur in our study. Although \nit has been stated that the short implants presented a higher failure \nrate than conventional implants12, some authors showed a survival \n\nrate for short implants ranging from 87.5%-100%6,11,16,17, and this rate \nwas very similar to the survival rate for conventional implants fitted \nin native bone areas14 or grafted areas6,15. This rate was confirmed \nby this study, although the follow-up time was short (6 months \nafter installation of the prosthesis).\n\nIt was shown in this study that short implants have lower \ndistance between the implant platform to the bone crest compared \nto conventional implants. However, these results do not represent \ngreater vertical bone loss in the group with conventional implants, \nbecause that differences already occurred in T0. The absence of \ndifferences in bone loss around conventional implants and short \nimplants has also been reported in other studies6,14. One clinical \nstudy with higher follow-up time than this study showed that \nshort-implants have cumulation bone loss of 0.3 \u00b1 0.5 mm at \n48\u00a0months. These authors showed that the crow- implant ratio is \none of the parameters that significant influence the bone loss in \nshort implants13. The effect of this parameter in long-term evaluated \nshould be better estimated.\n\nFinite element studies have shown that the increase in diameter \nof the implant causes a better distribution of masticatory stress18,19 \nand improves primary stability14,20. However, this trend was not \nobserved in our study, although the short implants were 5 mm in \ndiameter while the conventional implants were 4 mm in diameter.\n\nAnother important factor that can influence the bone level data \nis that although both implants present a switching platform, the \nshort implants presented a higher rate of mismatch between the \nabutment and the implant platform (0.525 mm) compared to the \nconventional implants (0.075 mm). It has been demonstrated that \nhigher mismatching between the abutment and the implant platform \nreduces bone loss21 and the occlusal tension around implants22. It is \nlikely that the short period of evaluation in our study did not allow \nfor identification of major changes at the peri-implant bone level.\n\nThe implant stability analysis demonstrated that the conventional \nimplants had higher RFA values in the immediate period after \ninstalling the prosthesis. However, with the establishment of stability \nafter application of occlusal loads, there were no differences of \nthis parameter between the implants. The conventional implant \nwas greater in length than the short implant, and consequently \npresented an increased contact area with the bone tissue that may \nhave been responsible for greater stability prior to the provisional \nprosthesis installation20. However, there has also been a progressive \nincrease in the stability of the short implant and a reduced stability \nof conventional implants, and this increase may be related to the fact \n\nTable 1.

These data \nshow that the implants were installed in areas that had similar \nbone density that was not altered by the osseointegration process \nand prosthetic loading of the implants. A study that evaluates the \neffects of progressive occlusal loading of the implants compared \nto conventional loading demonstrated that different types of \nprosthetic loading presented no difference in bone radiographic \ndensity around the implant23. This outcome suggests that after the \nosseointegration period, if prosthetic principles are respected, the \nocclusal load will not promote changes in the peri-implant bone \neven around implants with different heights and diameters.\n\nAlthough the parameters analyzed in this study are factors that \ninfluence the success rates of implants24, none of the parameters \nshowed a statistically significant correlation. One of the reasons \nfor this lack of correlation is that increased bone density probably \n\ndid not influence the increased contact between the implants and \nthe bone, which may have made the correlation between the bone \ndensity and RFA and the bone level very weak25. In addition, it \nhas been demonstrated that the peri-implant bone level was not \ninfluenced by bone density26. Moreover, it is possible that the low \nnumber of implants evaluated in this study and the short follow-up \nperiod may have influenced the absence of significant differences \nbetween short and conventional implants for the parameters that \nwere evaluated. Another limitation of this study was that the \ncrown-implant ration was not measured, and this parameter is \nan important variable for understanding the results of long-term \nevaluations. New long-term studies need to be performed to \nconsolidate the functional outcomes for short implants either with \na temporary or definitive prosthesis.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nGiven the methodology used and the results obtained, it can be \nconcluded that 1) short implants had similar results compared to \nconventional-length implants; 2) there was no significant correlation \nbetween the parameters of radiographic density, implant stability \nand the height of the peri-implant bone.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
