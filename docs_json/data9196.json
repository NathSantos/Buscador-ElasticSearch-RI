A BC \u00e9 j\u00e1 bem conhecida e \u00e9 utilizada em \n\nv\u00e1rios campos principalmente devido \u00e0 sua estrutura 3D que lhe confere excelentes \n\npropriedades, nomeadamente elevada capacidade de reten\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua, elevada porosidade \n\ne excelente desempenho mec\u00e2nico.

Foram preparados e \n\ncaracterizados v\u00e1rios nanocomp\u00f3sitos com quantidades vari\u00e1veis de pol\u00edmero e BC. Os \n\nmateriais nanocomp\u00f3sitos obtidos apresentaram propriedades mec\u00e2nicas e t\u00e9rmicas \n\nmelhoradas assim como valores de cristalinidade superiores quando comparados com o \n\npol\u00edmero puro. A citotoxicidade (teste MTT) dos nanocomp\u00f3sitos em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s celulas da \n\npele (HaCaT) foi tamb\u00e9m avaliada e os resultados demonstraram que as membranas n\u00e3o \n\ns\u00e3o citot\u00f3xicas at\u00e9 48 horas de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o. Finalmente, foram testadas duas potenciais \n\naplica\u00e7\u00f5es para os materiais obtidos, nomeadamente como sistemas de liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nf\u00e1rmacos e como suportes para a regenera\u00e7\u00e3o \u00f3ssea.

However, it is also produced by bacteria in a purer form called bacterial \n\ncellulose (BC). BC is well known and mainly used in several field for its peculiar 3D \n\nnetwork that confers to it outstanding properties such as water high holding capacity, high \n\nporosity and excellent mechanical properties. BC is also biodegradable and biocompatible. \n\nAmong the different fields of application, BC is greatly used, in its pure form or in the \n\nform of nanocomposites, in the biomedical field, as artificial blood vessels, controlled drug \n\ndelivery systems, and in tissue engineering, etc. \n\nThe present study reports the development of new nanocomposites made from BC and an \n\nacrylate polymer namely the poly(N-methacryloyl glycine) (PMGly) through an in situ free \n\nradical polymerization using N,N-methylenebis(acrylamide) (MBA) as cross linker agent. \n\nSeveral nanocomposites with different amounts of polymer and BC were prepared and \n\ncharacterized. The obtained nanocomposites displayed improved mechanical properties, \n\nthermal stability and crystallinity when compared to the homopolymer. Moreover, their \n\ncytotoxicity (MTT tests) in regard to HaCaT skin cells was also evaluated, and the results \n\nshowed that the new nanocomposites were not cytotoxic until 48 hours of exposure. \n\nFinally, two different potential applications were tested for these materials, namely as \n\nsystems for drug release and as scaffolds for bone regeneration. First, the membranes were \n\ntested as drug delivery system for diclofenac. The impregnation of the drug into the \n\nmembrane was successfully assessed and the drug dissolution was studied for different pH \n\nvalues (pH 7.4 and 2.1) at 37 \u00baC during 24 hours. However, the drug release was always \n\naccompanied by polymer dissolution. Secondly, the membranes were immersed in a \n\nsimulated body solution in order to grow hydroxyapatite particles on their surface, aiming \n\nan application in bone tissue engineering. However, this growth wasn\u2019t detected by XRD \n\nand SEM analysis. \n\n \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  1/56 \n\nTable of Contents \n\n \n\n1.

The context \n\nAt the time where high interest is devoted to the development of new technologies and materials \n\nin order to improve life quality, novel high performance health care products are one of the most \n\nimportant focus of scientists. Specifically, advanced medical textiles and devices are topics of \n\nlarge interest and fast development due to their importance in different fields such as wound \n\nhealing, implantable medical devices, bandaging, surgery, controlled drug delivery, etc. On the \n\nother hand, increasing attention and huge efforts have been dedicated to the creation of new \n\nenvironmentally friendly and sustainable materials. \n\nIn this context, the present thesis will focus on the development and the characterization of \n\nnovel bacterial cellulose (BC) based nanocomposites prepared by the in situ free radical \n\npolymerization of adequate monomers for potential application in the biomedical field, for \n\nexample as drug delivery systems or for bone tissue engineering. \n\nSeveral studies have shown the potentiality to prepare innovative bio-based nanocomposites \n\nwith distinct properties by combining bacterial cellulose with different natural or synthetic \n\npolymers using diverse methodologies. Indeed, BC is known for its peculiar 3D structure that \n\nconfers to it high mechanical properties and high water retention ability and is also used in \n\nseveral medical fields due to its non-cytotoxicity and biodegradability. Additionally, the \n\nselection of the polymer and the corresponding methodology used to perform the \n\npolymerization strongly influence the final properties of the nanocomposites. In this study, the \n\naim is to create a new bacterial cellulose based nanocomposite by combination with an acrylate \n\npolymer with amino-acid like moieties, namely poly(N-methacryloyl glycine), by means of in \n\nsitu free radical polymerization of N-methacryloyl glycine. This new material is expected to \n\npresent improved mechanical properties and biological activity as biocompatibility. In a final \n\ninstance, the objective of this work is to use this novel nanocomposite for biomedical \n\napplications such as for instance drug delivery, or for bone tissue engineering, therefore the \n\npossibility to induce biological activity to the BC membranes is very pertinent.  \n\nThe present manuscript will be divided into four main parts. An introduction, describing BC\u2019s \n\nproduction, properties and main applications, followed by a brief review of BC /polymer \n\nnanocomposites, with particular emphasis on nanocomposites prepared by in situ \n\npolymerization approaches. The second part will described the material and methods involved \n\nin the synthesis and characterisation of the new nanocomposites, as well as in the assessment of \n\nthe future potential applications of the nanocomposites. It will, finally, be followed by a chapter \n\ndescribing the obtained results and the main conclusions of the work.  \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  8/56 \n\n2. Introduction \n\nCellulose is the most abundant biopolymer on earth and was discovered in 1838 by Anselm \n\nPayen. This biopolymer is the main component of plant cell walls but it can be also produced by \n\nseveral other organisms, including algae, plankton and bacteria.[1] It can be also produced \n\nthrough enzymatic and chemical methods.[2] \n\nFrom a chemical point of view, cellulose is a polysaccharide composed of glucose units linked \n\nby ?(1-4) glycosidic bonds.[3] It is this type of chemical bonding that confers to cellulose its \n\nlinear structure. The repeating unit of a cellulose chain is represented in Figure 1. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Cellulose repeating unit. \n\n \n\nPlant cellulose is typically associated with other plant cell wall constituents, such as \n\nhemicelluloses, pectins and lignin, and is characterized by a fibrillar structure, composed of \n\ncrystalline and amorphous regions, resulting from the high tendency of cellulose chains to \n\nestablish intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds (Figure 2) that promote their aggregation. \n\nThose hydrogen bonds are also responsible for the high mechanical strength, high crystallinity \n\ndegree of cellulose [4] and insolubility in most common solvents. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - Cellulose chains with the hydrogen bondings. [4] \n\n \n\nAs shown in the Figure 3, cellulose fibers are composed of macrofibers, themselves composed \n\nof bundles of microfibers; that are aggregates of several cellulose chains. Plant cellulose \n\nmacrofibers can vary from 5 to 30 ?m in diameter and approximately from 1 to 25 mm in \n\nlength. For instance, cotton stalks have a length of 0.83 mm and a diameter of 19.6 ?m. [5] \n\n \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  9/56 \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - Cellulose fibrillar structure: a) cellulose fibers, b) macrofibers, c) microfibers, and d) \n\ncellulose chains. [6] \n\n \n\nThe crystalline structure of cellulose is quite complex because cellulose can exist in different \n\npolymorphs, specifically cellulose I, II, III and IV. Native cellulose commonly presents the \n\ncellulose I crystalline structure.[4] Moreover, due to some variations on the hydrogen bonding \n\nbetween cellulose chains, different cellulose allomorphs can be observed. For example, \n\ncellulose I has two allomorphs named I? and I? as represented in Figure 4.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - Cellulose allomorphs I?(left) and I? (right), Carbon ? Oxygen ? and Hyrdrogen ? \n\natoms.[7] \n\n \n\nThe degree of polymerization (DP) of cellulose varies in function of its sources, biosynthesis \n\nprocess and purification or modification treatments. Typically, native cellulose DP is between \n\n3000 and 15000: wood cellulose has a DP of about 10000 and cotton cellulose, the most pure \n\nform of cellulose, of 15000. Purification treatments normally induce a reduction of the degree of \n\npolymerization.[8] \n\nThis quite complex structure confers to cellulose properties such as hydrophilicity, \n\nbiodegradability, stiffness, and the ability to be chemically modified. [9] \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  10/56 \n\n2.1 Bacterial cellulose \n\nBacterial cellulose (BC) was first identified in 1886 by A. J. Brown. It is produced by bacteria \n\nin two main steps, namely the synthesis of uridine diphosphoglucose, and then its \n\npolymerization into ?-1-4-glucan chains.[10] \n\nAmong the bacteria capable of producing BC, the gram negative Gluconacetobacter xylinus \n\n(previously known as Acetobacter xylinum) is recognized as the most effective producer. G. \n\nxylinus (Figure 5) is a non-pathogenic, rod-shaped bacterium that produces cellulose from \n\nseveral carbon and nitrogen sources.[3] \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5 - SEM image of Gluconacetobacter xylinus bacteria.[2] \n\n2.1.1 Bacterial cellulose production \n\nBC can be produced in both static and agitated cultures. In stationary cultures, BC is obtained as \n\nan accumulation of a gelatinous membrane on the interface between the air and the culture \n\nmedium[11] (Figure 6, left), whereas in agitated cultures, it is synthesized in a deep medium in \n\nthe form of fibrous suspensions, pellets or irregular masses (Figure 6, right). [12] \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 6 - BC membrane produced in stationary culture (left) and BC pellets produced in agitated \n\nculture (right).[2] \n\n \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  11/56 \n\nBacterial cellulose made from agitated and static cultures presents a similar network structure; \n\nhowever, BC produced in agitated culture shows a lower degree of polymerization, crystallinity \n\nindex and Young's modulus.[13] It has been also shown [14] that BC prepared in agitated \n\nconditions is characterized by a lower I? mass fraction than cellulose produced statically. A \n\ndecrease of the cellulose fibrils size has also been observed in agitated culture when compared \n\nto static counterpart. \n\nStatic cultivation allows the control of the shape and size of the BC pellicles and also permits to \n\nobtain homogeneous membranes.[2] These properties are very well appreciated in the \n\nbiomedical field for instance. However, static cultivations are shaded by high production costs. \n\nIn order to overcome this limitation and improve the productions yields, some reactors have \n\nbeen developed. For instance, the horizontal lift reactor [15] and the rotator disk [16] (Figure 7) \n\nallow a semi-continuous cultivation of BC. The first one give the same properties as statically \n\nproduced BC whereas the rotating one produce a BC capable to retain two times more water \n\nthan BC produced in static conditions. Another reactor called \"aerosol bioreactor\" [17] can be \n\nused in order to produce BC in continuous conditions. The production is ensured by a spray of \n\nglucose at the interface between the culture medium and the air. It leads to homogeneous \n\npellicles with enhanced mechanical properties. Creation of several sheets of BC instead of one \n\nthick membrane is also possible by alternatively stop and start the flux of glucose. \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 7- Rotary disk reactor [15] (left); Horizontal lift reactor [4] (right). \n\n \n\nAgitating culture reactors have also been developed, they allow BC production with higher \n\nproduction rates, lower costs and different shapes such as elliptical (air lift modified reactor \n\n[18]) and spherical (bubble column reactor [2]). For instance, the air lift modified reactors allow \n\nproducing BC with a three time higher rate and the pellets had an average diameter of 10 mm. It \n\nhas been considered that these agitating reactors could be the most suitable for large scale BC \n\nproduction.[2]  \n\nAnother way to improve the BC production is to choose an appropriate culture medium. The \n\nmost influent parameters of a BC culture medium are the carbon and nitrogen sources. BC is \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  12/56 \n\nmostly produced using the Hestrin-Schramm (HS) medium that uses glucose as carbon source \n\nand a combination of peptone and yeast extract as nitrogen sources. [19] \n\nHowever, it has been observed that it is possible to enhance BC production by modifying this \n\nculture medium. Several types of carbon and nitrogen sources have been compared. Among the \n\ntested carbon sources, one can find several sugars such as glucose, sucrose, maltose, xylose, \n\nfructose, lactose, and polysaccharides as starch, but also other compounds such as ethanol and \n\nglycerol. Glycerol and glucose were the most efficient sources.[20] In the same study, several \n\nnitrogen sources such as peptone, yeast extract, tryptone, and polypeptone beef extract had also \n\nbeen compared, in that case yeast extract was the source leading to the higher BC production.  \n\n2.1.2 Bacterial cellulose properties \n\nFirst of all, bacterial cellulose has a high degree of polymerization (from 2000 to 8000) [21] and \n\na high crystallinity (generally between 60% and 90%).[21] BC is also well known and \n\nappreciated for its high purity, because in contrary to plant cellulose, BC is free of \n\nhemicelluloses, pectin and lignin. Furthermore, both plant cellulose and bacterial cellulose are \n\nbiocompatible and biodegradable.[2] \n\nSecondly, bacterial cellulose is characterized by a particular nano fibrillar network structure \n\nwhich confers to it high porosity and water retain capacity.[2] These properties are very useful \n\nin wound dressing or burn curing for instance.[22], [23] Specifically, BC nanofibers are \n\napproximately 3-15 nm thick and 70-80 nm width. Those nanofibers are composed of \n\nprotofibers of 2-4 nm diameter gathered to create a ribbon.[2] BC ribbons are arranged in a \n\nparticular 3D network (Figure 8) which is responsible for BC properties. [2], [24] \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 8 - SEM micrographs of bacterial cellulose surface [25] (left) and cross section [2] (right). \n\n \n\nThis peculiar nano fibrillar structure together with the high crystallinity provides also very good \n\nmechanical properties, especially in tension mode. Indeed, the Young's modulus of BC has been \n\nreported [2] to be equal to 15 GPa, which is very high compared to other typical polymers \n\nwidely used in commercial applications, such as polypropylene (PP) or poly(ethylene \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  13/56 \n\nterephthalate) (PET). Moreover, BC shows a tensile strength between 200-300 MPa, also \n\nconsiderably high when compared to other polymers and in the same range as steel. These \n\ntensile properties make BC very promising as reinforcing element to improve the mechanical \n\nresistance of composite materials. \n\n \n\nIn summary, BC and plant cellulose fibers have the same chemical structure but different \n\nmorphologies and fiber dimensions (Figure 9), and therefore, completely distinct properties, as \n\nsummarized and compared in the Table 1.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9 - Electron micrographs of plant cellulose fibers (left) and bacterial cellulose (right).[26] \n\n \n\nTable 1- Comparison of bacterial and plant cellulose fibers properties. \n\n \nDegree of \n\npolymerization \nNanofibers dimensions Tensile strength Young's modulus \n\nBC [2] 2000-8000 \n\n3-15 nm thickness \n\n70-80 nm width \n\n1-20 ?m length \n\n200-300 MPa 15 GPa \n\nPlant cellulose 3000-15000 [21] \n5-30 ?m diameter [5] \n\n1-25 mm length [5] \n\n300-500MPa \n\n[27] \n3-36GPa [27] \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  14/56 \n\n2.2 Bacterial cellulose applications \n\nBC peculiar properties have led to various applications in distinct fields, including for example \n\nthe food industry, cosmetics and biomedicine. \n\nBC is appreciated for its peculiar viscosity and gelatinous aspects. Indeed, BC is the main \n\ncomponent of the Philippian\u2019s dessert \"Nata de Coco\" [28] (Figure 10). BC has also been used \n\nas a food additive in order to modify the texture of the food or to reduce its caloric content.[1], \n\n[29]  \n\nIn the cosmetic industry, BC is used as a component of several commercial products such as, for \n\ninstance, facial scrubs [30] and masks.[31] \n\nNevertheless, it is in the biomedical field that BC found most potentialities. For example, BC's \n\nhigh mechanical strength coupled with its biocompatibility, in situ moldability and water \n\nretention capacity inspired the production of artificial BC blood vessels [1], [32] (Figure 10). \n\nThe high mechanical strength allows those vessels to resist to the high blood pressure. \n\nAdditionally, BC has also been explored in the field of tissue engineering and in particular for \n\nwound and burn treatment (Figure 10).[22] Indeed, its capacity to retain water is really \n\nappreciated in order to repair the skin after a burn. BC is able to keep the moisture close to the \n\nwound and also to protect it from the air, facilitating the skin regeneration. \n\nLast but not least, BC has been investigated as a drug delivery system,[3], [33]\u2013[40] in \n\nparticular for transdermal applications. It has been studied in drug delivery system mostly for its \n\nporous structure, mechanical properties and its biocompatibility. For example, the use of BC \n\nmembranes for transdermal delivery of several drugs, as lidocaine, ibuprofen, caffeine and \n\ndiclofenac have been reported.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10 - a) Nata de coco; b) BC artificial blood vessel;[32] c) BC as wound healing \n\nmembranes.[16]  \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  15/56 \n\n2.3 BC/polymer nanocomposites \n\nThe potentialities of BC can be extended by combining it with other materials including natural \n\nor synthetic polymers or even inorganic nanophases (for example, BC/silver nanoparticles [23], \n\n[41], [42], BC/hydroxyapatite [25], [43]\u2013[46], BC/Fe3O4 [47], BC/Silica [48]). Regarding the \n\nnanocomposites made with polymers, BC has for instance, been extensively used as reinforcing \n\nelement in nanocomposites for potential applications in numerous fields as electronics and \n\nbiomedicine areas.[3], [9], [49]\u2013[51] There are at least four distinct ways to prepare BC based \n\nnanocomposites: namely (a) blending BC with the polymeric matrix either by melting-mixing or \n\ndispersion of BC into the polymer solution followed by drying [52], [53]; (b) modification of \n\nthe bacteria culture medium (addition of the polymer into the culture medium) [54]\u2013[56]; (c) \n\nincorporation of a polymer solution into BC membranes by diffusion followed by drying [57]\u2013\n\n[60] and, (d) in situ polymerization inside the BC network.[45], [61]\u2013[65] \n\nIn this study, particular attention will be given to BC nanocomposites prepared by in situ \n\npolymerization. However, some current researches made with each of the above mentioned \n\nmethodologies will be also presented in the next section. \n\n2.3.1 BC nanocomposites prepared by blending \n\nPreparing a BC nanocomposite by blending typically involves the previous disintegration and/or \n\nmodification of the BC membrane followed by mixing with the chosen polymeric matrix. The \n\nblending step can be made either by melting mixing, or by dispersion of BC nanofibrils in a \n\npolymer solution followed by solvent casting or other drying methodology, as supercritical CO2 \n\ndrying. \n\nSeveral types of nanocomposites prepared by blending were studied among which one can for \n\nexample find, BC/poly(L-lactic acid),[52] and BC/thermoplastic starch(TPS)[53];  \n\nFor example, BC/thermoplastic starch [53] nanocomposites were made using shredded bacterial \n\ncellulose. BC nanofibers were included into the TPS matrix during the gelatinization process of \n\nthe polymer. As a result, good adhesion between BC and TPS was observed, as well as a good \n\ndispersion of the fibers into the matrix. Moreover, an enhancement of the thermal properties, \n\ntensile strength and Young's modulus of the polymer were promoted by the addition of BC \n\n(Figure 11). However, even if the moisture sorption was reduced by BC, the obtained \n\ncomposites appeared to be humidity sensitive. \n\n \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  16/56 \n\n \n\nFigure 11 - Young modulus (a) and tensile strength (b) of corn starch thermoplastic composites \n\nreinforced with 1% and 5% of bacterial and vegetable cellulose.[53]  \n\n \n\nAnother example of BC nanocomposites made by blending are the BC/poly(L-lactic acid) \n\n(PLA) that were produced by Yuan and co-workers.[52] These composites were made by \n\nthermal-induced liquid-solid phase separation technology in order to reinforce PLA with BC \nfibers. As a result, the obtained composite had better surface hydrophilicity and thermal \n\nproperties than PLA, and enhanced porosity and mechanical properties compared to that of the \n\nhomopolymer. \n\n2.3.2 BC nanocomposites made by modifying the culture medium \n\nThe modification of the BC culture medium to produce novel nanocomposites is normally \n\nachieved by the addition of either soluble or insoluble polymers to the culture medium before \n\nthe inoculation. Therefore, the polymer is incorporated into the BC network during the \n\nbiosynthesis. Normally, this modification of the culture medium doesn't require a special \n\nprocessing after BC production; however, typical purification treatments need to be performed. \n\nCulture modification has been used, for example, to synthesize BC nanocomposites with chitin \n\nnanocrystals,[54],  poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO),[55] and  poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA).[56] \n\nFor instance, BC/poly(ethylene oxide) nanocomposites were prepared by adding PEO in the \n\nculture medium.[55] Different BC/PEO w/w ratios were tested (from 15:85 to 59:41) and it has \n\nbeen observed that the higher the ratio the smaller the cellulose nanofibers were. The cellulose \n\nnanofibers were attached in bundles of 75-770 nm wide and the size of the bundles increase \n\nwith the content of PEO. However, for all tested ratios, the BC nanofibers were homogeneously \n\ndispersed in the PEO matrix. The crystallinity and melting temperature of the nanocomposites \n\nwere reduced when compared to that of PEO; for the ratio 59:41 the crystallinity went from \n\n67% for pure PEO to 21% and the melting temperature of PEO decreased 10 degrees (Figure \n\n12). Results have also shown that the ratio between I? and I? decrease with an increase of the \n\nBC:PEO ratio and that the preferred crystallization form of BC was I?. However, PEO thermal \n\nstability and tensile properties were increased by the inclusion of BC. \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  17/56 \n\n \n\nFigure 12 - DSC thermograms illustrating the determination of the glass transition and melting \n\ntemperatures in the nanocomposite (left) and the variation in the melting endotherm of PEO as a \n\nfunction of the BC/PEO w/w ratio (right).[55]  \n\n \n\nAnother study reported the synthesis of BC/poly(vinyl alcohol) nanocomposites by addition of \n\nPVA into the bacteria culture medium.[56] PVA was introduced to the HS medium under \n\nstirring and then incubated at 28 \u00b0C. The obtained pellicles were then cross-linked with glyoxal. \n\nThese nanocomposites kept the transparency of PVA, even for the largest amount of BC. \n\nHowever, the presence of the cross-linker induced a yellowish coloration to the films. BC \n\nincorporation in the PVA matrix has led to an increase in the crystallinity of the matrix in the \n\nnanocomposite; nevertheless, it did not impact its ductility. Finally, the reinforcement of PVA \n\nwith BC led to nanocomposites with excellent mechanical, thermal and dimensional properties, \n\nas well as moisture stability. This enhancement of the nanocomposites properties is mainly due \n\nto hydrogen bonding and chemical cross-linking between PVA and BC. \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  18/56 \n\n2.3.3 BC nanocomposites prepared by diffusion of a polymer solution into the BC membrane \n\nThis methodology consists in introducing a BC membrane into a specific polymer solution \n\nallowing the polymer solution to migrate into the membrane by diffusion. Afterwards, the \n\nsample is dried to obtain the nanocomposites. \n\nThis technique has already been used to synthesized BC/poly(ethylene glycol),[57] BC/poly(3-\n\nhydroxybutyrate),[58] and BC/polycaprolactone (PCL) [60] and BC/poly(L-lactic acid) (PLA) \n\n[59] nanocomposites, among many others. \n\n \n\nFor instance, BC/poly(L-lactic acid) (PLA) [59] nanocomposites were prepared by introducing \n\nBC membranes into a PLA solution in chloroform. Optical analysis showed that the \n\ncharacteristic transparency of PLA was kept even after the incorporation of BC (Figure 13). In \n\naddition, BC/PLA nanocomposites showed higher crystallinity than pure PLA and improved \n\nmechanical properties. \n\n \n\nFigure 13 - Light transmittance of (a) bacterial cellulose pellicle, (b) PLLA/bacterial \n\ncellulose nanocomposite film, and (c) PLLA film.[59]  \n\n2.3.4 BC nanocomposites prepared by in situ polymerization \n\nThe preparation of BC nanocomposites by in situ polymerization involves the introduction of a \n\nmonomer (and initiator and/or cross linker) into the BC membrane, and finally the \n\npolymerization is subsequently triggered by setting-up appropriated conditions. Different types \n\nof polymerization approaches can be used, such as conventional free radical polymerization, \n\natom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer \n\n(RAFT), among others. For instance, ATRP is a polymerization technique that allows the \n\ncovalent linkage between the polymer and the cellulose chains, while in conventional free \n\nradical polymerization it could be necessary to use a bi-functional monomer to promote the \n\ncross linkage of the polymer inside the BC network and consequently prevent its lixiviation \n\nduring processing or washing. \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  19/56 \n\nSeveral BC nanocomposites had already been prepared by in situ polymerization using different \n\nmonomers (aniline,[61] styrene,[45] 4-styrene sulfonic acid,[66]  acrylate monomers[62]\u2013[65]) \n\nand polymerization methodologies. \n\nFor example, conducting BC nanocomposites were prepared by conventional polymerization of \n\naniline, in the presence of dodecylbenzenylsulfonic acid (DBSA), into a BC membrane.[61] \n\nFirst, a DBSA/aniline solution in ethanol and water was prepared and then, the BC membranes \n\nwere introduced in the solution; afterward the polymerization was carried out at 25 \u00b0C during 24 \n\nh. The obtained nanocomposites membranes were washed with ethanol. FTIR and XRD \n\nanalysis were performed and confirmed the polymerization of aniline inside the bacterial \n\ncellulose network. Moreover, mechanical tests showed that the nanocomposites were more \n\nbrittle than BC alone. However, the results showed that the nanocomposites were conductive \n\nwhich confirmed the potentialities of BC as scaffold to create conductive materials. \n\nIn another study, Peng et al. [45] prepared BC/polystyrene (PS) nanocomposites by adding a \n\nBC membrane into a styrene solution with 1 wt% of azodiisobutyronitrile (AIBN) at room \n\ntemperature during 3 hours. SEM analysis showed that the porous structure of BC was modified \n\nby the PS incorporation mainly because it filled the pores of the BC membranes. Additionally, \n\nresults showed that the nanocomposites were characterized by a lamellar structure (Figure 14) \n\nof 300 nm maximum layer thickness and that the mechanical properties of PS were increased by \n\nthe creation of the nanocomposites. However, no signs of strong interaction between the two \n\ncompounds (PS and BC) were observed. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 14 - SEM micrographs of the cross section of BC/PS nanocomposites.[45] \n\n \n\nIn situ polymerization has also been explored to prepare distinct acrylate polymers/BC \n\nnanocomposites.[62]\u2013[65], Acrylate polymers are widely used because they are very well \n\nknown by chemists and easy to prepare and to tune due to the high availability of different \n\nacrylate monomers. \n\nFor example, BC/poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) nanocomposites films were \n\nprepared by conventional in situ polymerization using poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  20/56 \n\n(PEGDA) as cross-linker.[62] PHEMA appeared to fill the BC membranes in a quite \n\nhomogeneous way (Figure 15) and an increase of the translucence of the materials was \n\nobserved. It has been also shown that the cross-linking prevented the dissolution of the polymer \n\nduring the washing step and consequently, the polymer content in the nanocomposites increased \n\nwith the amount of PEGDA. It was also observed that the 3D structure of BC was not affected \n\nby the polymerization. The thermal stability and mechanical properties of these nanocomposites \n\nwere enhanced when compared to those of PHEMA due to the excellent compatibility between \n\nBC and the PHEMA. Finally, a good swelling ratio of 200-260% was obtained and \n\nbiocompatibility tests confirmed that these nanocomposite films were non-cytotoxic and \n\nallowed the cellular proliferation. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 15 \u2013 Visual aspects of BC/PHEMA/PEGDA (left) and SEM cross sections images (right)[62]  \n\n \n\nIn addition, BC/poly(glycerol methacrylate) (PGMMA),[63] BC/poly(2-hydroxyethyl \n\nmethacrylate) (PHEMA),[63] BC/poly(2-ethoxyethyl methacrylate) (PEOEMA),[63], [64] \n\nBC/poly(2-ethylhexyl acrylate) (PEHA),[64] BC/poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone) (PNVP) [64] \n\nhydrogels were prepared by Hobzova et al. [63] and Kramer et al. [64] All hydrogels were \n\nprepared by UV radical polymerization in an aqueous medium after introducing the different \n\nmonomers into the BC membrane. However, for the case of EOEMA and EHA, which are \n\nhydrophobic, a solvent exchange reaction from water to 2-propanol and ethanol was performed. \n\nCross-linkers were used in all cases, and results showed that an almost complete filling of the \n\nBC membrane by the polymers was attained with the highest concentration of cross-linkers and \n\nonly partial fiber covering was obtained with lower concentrations. All nanocomposites were \n\ncharacterized by a good dispersion of the polymers within the BC network and cross linkage \n\nappeared to reduce swelling capacity of the composites when high concentrations of cross \n\nlinkers were used. Figure 16 shows the aspect of a swelled composite. Regarding the \n\nmechanical properties, it was observed for all hydrogels an improvement of these properties \n\nwhen compared to the neat polymers. \n\n \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  21/56 \n\n \n\nFigure 16 - Photograph of BC \u2013 poly(HEMA-co-EOEMA) composite in the swollen state.[63]  \n\n \n\nFinally, in a different study, BC/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and BC/poly(n-butyl \n\nacrylate) (PBA) nanocomposites were produced by ATRP.[65] Firstly, BC membranes were \n\nfunctionalized by esterification with 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide (BiBBR) and then methyl \n\nmethacrylate or n-butyl acrylate were polymerized from the BC macro initiator (Figure 17). \n\n \n\nFigure 17 - Diagram of the various stages of the polymerization reaction.[65]  \n\n \n\nThe obtained composites had properties depending on the amount of polymer grafted into the \n\nmembranes. Specifically, high grafting led to thermal behaviour similar to the corresponding \n\nhomopolymer while composites with low polymer incorporation had a TGA profile closer to \n\nthat of BC itself. The grafting of the polymer conferred to the nanocomposites a hydrophobic \n\ncharacter (Figure 18), as well as a decrease of the mechanical properties compared to those of \n\nBC. \n\n \n\nFigure 18 - Contact angle of a water droplet over (a) pristine BC, (b) BC-g-PMMA, and (c) BC-g-\n\nPBA.[65] \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  22/56 \n\n3.

The phosphate buffer solution (PBS) \n\n(pH:7.2) and the Dulbecco?s Modified Eagle?s Medium (DMEM), as well as the fetal bovine \n\nserum (FBS), L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin and fungizone were purchased from Gibco, \n\n(Life Technologies, (Carlsbad, CA, USA), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (reagent plus ? 95%) \n\nand thiozolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.

After this period, the flask was vigorously agitated and \n\n5 mL of the culture media was withdrawn and inoculated into a 45 mL liquid production \n\nmedium in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks. BC membranes were then treated three times with a 0.5 \n\nM NaOH solution, at 80 \u00baC, for 30 min and washed with distilled water until its whitening and \n\nreaching pH 7.0. [68] \n\n3.3 BC_PMGly nanocomposites \n\nWet BC 4x4 cm\u00b2 membranes were weighted and 60% of their water content was removed by \n\nhand pressing. They were then placed in balloons purged with nitrogen (N2) at 0 \u00baC during 1 \n\nhour with an aqueous solution of N-methacryloyl glycine, 2,2?-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) \n\ndihydrochloride (radical initiator) and N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (cross-linker). Finally, the \n\nballoons were left at 70 \u00baC during 6 hours. The membranes were then washed several times with \n\ndistilled water and leftward in water during one night. Afterwards, they were dried in the oven \n\nat 40\u00b0C during 12 hours. The list of the different samples prepared, as well as their \n\ncompositions is presented in Table 2. \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  23/56 \n\n \n\nTable 2: List of the prepared membranes with their compositions \n\nSample WMGly/WBC WMBA/WMGly WAAPH/WMGly \n\nBC - - - \n\nBC_PMGly (1:1) 1 5% 1% \n\nBC_PMGly (1:2) 2 5% 1% \n\nBC_PMGly (1:3) 3 5% 1% \n\nBC_PMGly (1:5) 5 5% 1% \n\n3.4 Drug delivery assays \n\nImpregnation of diclofenac (DCF) into a BC_PMGly membrane \n\nTwo different membranes of BC_PMGly 1:3 (one with 5% of cross-linker and the other with \n\n10%) were prepared following the procedure explained in the section 3.2 and kept in wet state; \n\nin the meantime, a diclofenac solution was prepared by dissolving 80 mg of DCF in 5 mL of \n\nwater. \n\nAfter being drained (40%) the membranes were immersed into the diclofenac solution until \n\ncomplete absorption of the solution and dried in the oven at 40 \u00b0C following the method used by \n\nSilva et al.[37], and Trovatti et al.[35] and then the release of drug was studied. Table 3 \n\nsummarizes the different membranes that were prepared and their compositions.  \n\n \n\nTable 3: Nanocomposites\u2019 designation and compositions prepared for drug release \n\nSample WMGly/WBC WMBA/WMGly WAAPH/WMGly Diclofenac (mg/mL) \n\nBC _PMGly (1:3:5)_DCF 3 5% 1% 20 \n\nBC_PMGly (1:3:10)_DCF 3 10% 1% 20 \n\n \n\nDrug release test \n\nThe release of the drug was tested at two different pH values, namely pH 7.4 and 2.1, in order to \n\ncompare the influence of the pH media on the release profile. \n\n \n\nDrug release tests at pH 7.4 were performed with a 0.01 M phosphor buffer solution (pH 7.4). \n\nThis solution was prepared by dissolving 8.0 g of NaCl, 0.2 g of KCl, 0.24 g of KH2PO4 and \n\n3.63 g Na2HPO4.10H2O in 1 L of distilled water. The BC membrane was then placed in 500 mL \n\nof this solution previously heated at 37 \u00b0C. 5 mL aliquots of the solution were removed every \n\nhour and the absorbance at 276 nm was assessed in order to control the release of the drug.  \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  24/56 \n\nDrug release tests at pH 2.1 were performed by immersing the impregnated nanocomposites \n\ninto an aqueous solution of HCl (pH 2.1) at 37 \u00b0C during 24 hours. Again, the release of the \n\ndrug was controlled by measuring the absorbance of the solution every hour. \n\n3.5 Biomineralization of the nanocomposites \n\nThe biomimetic growth of hydroxyapatite was initiated from simulated body fluid solution and \n\nadapted from literature data. [25], [44], [46], [69], [70] \n\nTo prepare the SBF solution, 6.5456 g of NaCl were dissolved into 960 mL of water, then \n\n2.2682 g of NaHCO3, 0.373 g of KCl and 0.1419 g of Na2PO4 were added to the solution, that \n\nwas then heated to 37\u00b0C before adding 0.3049 g of MgCl2 x 6H2O, 9 mL of 1M HCl, 0.3675 g \n\nof CaCl2 x 2H2, 0.071 g of Na2SO4 and 6.057 g of (CH2OH)3CNH2. The pH of the solution was \n\nthen adjusted to 7.4 with 40mL of 1M HCl. The volume of the solution was then fixed to 1000 \n\nmL with distilled water. The solution was kept in the refrigerator. Magnetic stirring was \n\nmaintained during the entire preparation. \n\n24 hours later, the nanocomposites were immersed into the SBF solution at 37 \u00b0C for 7 days. \n\nThe supersaturation conditions were maintained by refreshing the solution every 24hours. The \n\nresulted nanocomposites were then rinsed with water and dried (half of the sample: freeze dried \n\n(FD), the other half: oven dried (OD)) before being characterised by SEM and XRD. \n\n3.6 Nanocomposites characterization \n\nAll the obtained nanocomposites membranes were characterized in terms of structure (FTIR), \n\ncrystallinity (XRD), morphology (SEM), thermal stability (TGA), mechanical properties \n\n(tensile tests, DMA), swelling behaviour and biological properties (MTT test). \n\n3.6.1 Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) \n\nFTIR-ATR spectra were taken with a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR System Spectrum BX \n\nspectrophotometer equipped with a single horizontal Golden Gate ATR cell over the range 600\u2013\n\n4000 cm?1 at a resolution of 2 cm?1 averaged on 32 scans. \n\n3.6.2 X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) \n\nXRD analysis were carried out on a PANalytica Empyrean diffractometer using Cu K? radiation \n\n(?=1.541?). Analysis were made in reflection mode from 5\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 (2?) with a step of 0.026\u00b0 \n\nand an absolute step rate of 197s. \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  25/56 \n\n3.6.3 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) \n\nSEM micrographs of the membranes surface and cross-section were taken with a HR-FESEM \n\nSU-70 Hitachi equipment operating at 4kV. All samples were coated with evaporated carbon. \n\nSurface micrographs were obtained with magnification of x10000 and x30000 and cross-section \n\nmicrographs with magnification of x3500 and x15000. \n\n3.6.4 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) \n\nTGA assays were carried out with a SETSYS Setaram TGA analyser equipped with a platinum \n\ncell. The samples were heated from 20 \u00baC to 800 \u00baC with a constant rate of 10 \u00baC min-1 under a \n\nnitrogen flow of 10 mL min-1. \n\n3.6.5 Dynamical Mechanical Analysis (DMA) \n\nDMA was performed with a Tritec 2000 DMA (Triton Technologies) operating in tension \n\nmodes (single strain) at 1 Hz and 0.005 mm displacement. Samples (30 x 5 mm\u00b2) were heated \n\nfrom -100 \u00baC to 170 \u00baC with a constant heating rate of 2 \u00baC min-1. \n\n3.6.6 Mechanical tests \n\n50 x 10 mm\u00b2 specimens were tested in tension with an Instron 5564 equipment. After being \n\ndried in the oven, the specimens were put in a desiccator during 48h to assure a homogeneous \n\nhumidity and then tested at room temperature with a rate of 10 mm min-1 using a 1 kN load cell. \n\n2 membranes were tested for each nanocomposite composition and 3 replicates were analysed \n\nfor each membrane. Elongation at break (%), tensile strength (MPA), and Young\u2019s modulus \n\n(MPA) were computed with the Bluehill 3 software. \n\n3.6.7 Swelling ratio (SR) \n\nThe swelling ratios (SR) of the membranes were determined by measuring the weight difference \n\nbetween wet and dry states of the membranes using the following equation:  \n\nSR (%) = (Ws \u2013 Wd)/Wd x 100; where Ws is the weight of the specimen in the swollen state and \n\nWd its initial weight in the dry state. For the measurements, 10x10 mm\u00b2 specimens were dried, \n\nand then immersed in distilled water. Weight increase was then regularly registered during 48 \n\nhours. \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  26/56 \n\n3.6.8 MTT test \n\nMTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) test was performed on \n\nBC, BC_PMGly 1:1 and BC_PMGly 1:3 in order to assess the cytotoxicity of the membranes. \n\nThe membranes with a BC:monomer ratio of 1:1 and 1:3 were chosen as they are the two \n\nextreme conditions we have. \n\nA MTT test is a colorimetric assay that is used to determine the viability of the cell metabolic \n\nactivity. In our case, in order to be closer to the one of the aimed applications (transdermal \n\ndelivery), we have chosen to work with HaCaT skin cells which is a non-tumorigenic \n\nimmortalized human keratinocyte cell line. [71] For the test, the cells were grown in complete \n\nDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-\n\nglutamine, 10000 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin and 250 \u00b5g/mL fungizone at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 \n\nhumidified atmosphere. Cells were daily observed under an inverted phase-contrast Eclipse \n\nTS100 microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The tests were performed on the two extreme \n\nnanocomposites: BC_PMGly 1:1 and BC_PMGly 1:3, and to have more accurate results, 3 \n\nsamples per nanocomposites were tested. \n\n \n\nBiocompatibility assessment was divided into 3 main steps: \n\n- Preparation of the extract: step during which the membranes are immersed into the chosen \n\nmedia to induce the dissolution of every product /compound that could be toxic into the media; \n\n- Exposure/incubation of the cells: the previous extract is added to the cells, the plates are then \n\nput in the incubator from 24h to 72h depending on the test conditions.  \n\n- Addition of the MTT reagent and the reading of the plates: the MTT reagent is absorbed by the \n\ncells, and the ones that are still alive transform the MTT into its insoluble purple formazan \n\nderivative. By assessing the difference of absorbance between the \u201ccontrol\u201d wells and the wells \n\nwith cells and extract, we are then able to estimate to quantity of cells still alive at the end of the \n\ntest and therefore characterize the cytotoxicity of the samples.  \n\n \n\nProtocol of the test: \n\nSamples of 6 cm\u00b2 area were prepared, rinsed with ultra-pure water and then sterilized in ethanol \n\n70% during one hour. After that time, they were rinsed again with sterilized PBS to remove the \n\nethanol, dissolved in 1.5 mL of medium and incubated at 37 \u00baC, with 5% CO2 for 24 hours to \n\nprepare the extract. Due to the powder state of the polymer, its extract was prepared by \n\ndissolving 100 mg of polymer into 4.5 mL of medium and sterilized by filtration with a \n\nnanocellulose filter. \n\nIn the meantime, three 96 wells plates were prepared with 5x4 wells filled up with 60000 \n\ncells/well, 50000 cells/well and 30000 cells/well corresponding to a future incubation time of 24 \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  27/56 \n\nh, 48 h, and 72 h. The cells were then incubated during 24 h for adhesion. After that time, the \n\nextracts obtained from the incubated membranes were removed and 100 ?L of it were added to \n\neach well. The plates were then incubated for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h.  \n\nAt the end of the incubation time, 50 ?L of MTT (at a concentration of 1 g L-1) were added in \n\neach well and incubated for 4 h at 37 \u00baC in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. After that, culture \n\nmedium was removed and 150 ?L of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were added into the wells and \n\nthe plate was placed in a shaker for 2 hours with gentle mixing. Three more wells were filled up \n\nwith DMSO to perform the blank absorbance measurement. The plates were finally read with a \n\nBioTek Synergy HT plate reader. The absorbance of the wells was measured at 570, 551 and \n\n842 nm and analysed with Gen5.1 software. Data were analyzed by a two way ANOVA, \n\nfollowed by a Holm-Sidak test to evaluate the significant differences between the different \n\nmembranes. \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  28/56 \n\n4. Results and Discussion \n\nDifferent BC nanocomposites membranes were prepared by varying the amount of monomer \n\nimpregnated into the BC membranes in order to determine the influence of the polymer content \n\nonto the nanocomposites properties. Furthermore, because of the different analyses \n\nrequirements, membranes were also prepared with different sizes and shapes, either 4x4 cm\u00b2 \n\nsquare or 7 cm diameter disc. However, due to the impossibility to perform a film from the \n\npoly(N-methacryloyl glycine), several analysis such as the tensile test and DMA were not \n\nperformed on the polymer alone. \n\nThe schematic representation of the reaction involved during the free radical polymerization is \n\ndisplayed in Figure 19 and the visual aspect of the obtained nanocomposites membranes, in the \n\ndry and wet states, and of BC is shown in Figure 20. \n\nOne can see that BC, in the dry state, has the appearance of a white film, contrary to the dried \n\nnanocomposites that appeared as yellowish films. This first change of visual aspect allowed us \n\nto confirm the polymerization of the N-methacryloyl glycine into the membranes. Additionally, \n\nthe membranes with a BC/monomer ratio of 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 were quite flexible. However, due \n\nto a too high amount of polymer and cross linker, the one 1:5 membrane was very brittle and \n\ntherefore, the detailed characterization analyses were not performed for this membrane. On the \n\nother hand, the wet membranes have the aspect of white swollen gels with good malleability. \n\nBy analysing the visual aspect of the membrane, homogeneity differences could also been \n\nperceived; indeed, square membranes seemed to be more homogeneous than the disc ones. This \n\ndifference might be due to a better repartition of the monomer into the membranes and a more \n\nperfect distribution of both membranes\u2019 surfaces in the case of a smaller sample thanks to a \n\nbetter fitting into the reaction balloon. Moreover, due to the drying step, some irregularities \n\nwere also observed on the membranes surfaces. In order to improve the homogeneity of the \n\nmembranes, the circular nanocomposites were then prepared in an Erlenmeyer instead of a \n\nballoon, to induce a better symmetry of the membranes\u2019 surfaces into the reaction medium. \n\nFinally, the amount of polymer impregnated into the membranes, as well as the yield \n\n(conversion rate) of the polymerization reaction were determined by assessing the weight \n\ndifference before and after the in situ free radical polymerization and are summarized in Table \n\n4. The thickness of the membranes, in dry state, were also measured and correlated with the \n\namount of acrylate polymer introduced into the membranes. The higher the amount of acrylate \n\npolymer introduced, the thicker the membranes, nevertheless, one has to keep in mind that this \n\nthickness, is also influenced by the initial thickness of the BC membrane. \n\n \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  29/56 \n\n \n\nFigure 19 - Schematic representation of the MGly free radical polymerization reaction using MBA \n\nas a cross-linker and AAPH as thermal initiator. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 20 - Visual aspects of a) dry BC, b) dry and c) wet nanocomposite (BC_PMGly 1:3).  \n\n \n\nTable 4: Effective Polymer/BC ratio, polymerization yield, and thickness of the different \n\nnanocomposites.

Figure 21 displays the FTIR-ATR spectra of pure BC, PMGly and the \n\ndifferent BC_PMGly nanocomposites prepared in this study.  \n\nOn the one hand, the main bands observed in the FTIR spectrum of pure BC are a broad band \n\naround 3340 cm-1 corresponding to the O-H vibrations; two small bands around 2893 cm-1 \n\nattributed to the stretching vibrations of the CH2 and CH groups; two peaks around 1330 cm\n-1 \n\nand 1105 cm-1, respectively matching the C-H and C-O vibrations of the C-OH groups; and a \n\nsharp band around 980-1050 cm-1 assigned to the stretching vibration of C-O-C of the acetal \n\nlinkages of cellulose [66], [72], [73]  \n\nOn the other hand, the FTIR spectrum of PMGly is characterized by one band at 3342 cm-1 \n\nassigned to the amine N-H stretching; another one at 2930 cm-1 due to the O-H vibrations, two \n\npeaks corresponding to the stretching of the C=O moieties at 1715 cm-1 (methacryloyl) and \n\n1621 cm-1 (glycine), and one peak at 1190 cm-1 corresponding to the vibrations of the C-O \n\ncoming from the C-OH groups of the glycine moieties. \n\nIn addition, while looking at the nanocomposites spectra, one can first observe that they clearly \n\ncorrespond to the sum of BC\u2019s and PMGly\u2019s spectra, which corroborate the success of the \n\npolymerization. Hence, the polymerization was confirmed by the appearance of the specific \n\nvibrations of PMGly such as: the two bands matching the C=O vibrations at 1715 cm-1 (C=O \n\nmethacryloyl) and 1623 cm-1 (C=O glycine); the band at 1519 cm-1 attributed to the NH \n\ndeformation; and the one at 1191 cm-1 due to the vibrations of the C-O acrylate ester. The NH \n\ncharacteristic vibration at 3340 cm-1 can also be observed on the nanocomposites spectra, \n\nhowever, one can notice that it appears with a decreased intensity compared to the one on the \n\npolymer spectrum due to overlap with the OH vibration of bacterial cellulose. The bands at \n\n2894 cm-1 (C-H stretching), 1300-1400 cm-1 (C-OH) and 1160-1190 cm-1 (C-O stretching) are \n\ntypical of both BC and PMGly. Finally, the results show that the intensity of the characteristic \n\npeaks of the polymer are increasing with the amount of polymer into the nanocomposite. \n\n \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  31/56 \n\n \n\nFigure 21 - FTIR-ATR spectra of native BC, PMGly and BC_PMGly nanocomposites with \n\ndifferent compositions. \n\n4.2 X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) \n\nX-ray diffraction analyses were performed on BC and BC nanocomposites to evaluate the effect \n\nof the polymerization on the crystallinity of the different membranes. The obtained \n\ndiffractograms are shown in the Figure 22. \n\nThe diffraction pattern of BC, displays the typical reflections of Cellulose I with peaks at 2? \n\nequal to 14.8\u00b0 (101), 16.8\u00b0 (101), 22.9\u00b0 (002) and 36.3\u00b0 (040). [21], [65], [72]  \n\nConversely, poly(N-methacryloyl glycine) is an amorphous polymer. Indeed, no significant \n\ncrystalline orientation reflections are observed on its diffractogram. It is characterized by a \n\nbroad band centered on 18\u00b0 typical of amorphous polymers. \n\nRegarding the different nanocomposites, one can noticed that they all displayed the same \n\ncrystalline pattern, with three main reflections coming from BC semi-crystalline structure at 2? \n\nequal to 14.4\u00b0, 16.8\u00b0 and 22.7\u00b0; furthermore, the spectra showed a decrease crystallinity \n\ncompared to BC due to introduction of the amorphous polymer into BC\u2019s network. \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  32/56 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 22 - Diffractograms of pure BC, PMGly, and BC_PMGly nanocomposites. \n\n4.3 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) \n\nA selection of SEM micrographs of the surface and cross-section of the different \n\nnanocomposites membranes and pure BC are shown in Figure 23. Those SEM analyses were \n\nused to additionally confirm the polymerization reaction, to determine the morphology of the \n\nnanocomposites and compare the difference in the structure induced by the amount of polymer \n\nintroduced into each membrane. \n\nThe micrographs of pure BC showed the typical 3D network structure of BC revealing \n\nrandomly organised nanofibers (surface images) and a lamellar structure (cross-section \n\nmicrographs). [24], [66], [72] \n\nThe micrographs of the different nanocomposite membranes allowed to observe not only the \n\ninclusion of the acrylate polymer into the BC 3D network but also the polymer formation on \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  33/56 \n\nBC\u2019s surface and, therefore, allowed to confirm the success of the polymerization. Moreover, all \n\nthe nanocomposite membranes clearly showed the typical nano- and microstructure of BC, \n\nwhich permits to affirm that this was not affected by the polymerization reaction (Figure 23). \n\nFinally, by the comparison of the different nanocomposites micrographs one can observe that, \n\nas expected, the lower the ratio BC/monomer, the higher the amount of polymer included into \n\nthe BC membranes. Indeed, this is illustrated on the cross-section micrographs, by more filled \n\nup lamellar spaces in the case of a ratio 1:3 than 1:1 and on surface micrographs, by an higher \n\ncovering of the 3D network (membranes 1:3) and a more distinct network in the case of the 1:1 \n\nmembranes (Figure 23). \n\n \n\nFigure 23 - SEM surface and cross-section micrographs of BC (left), BC_PMGly (1:1) (middle) and \n\nBC_PMGly (1:3) (right). Surface images are on the first two rows with magnifications of x10k and \n\nx30k and cross-section images are on the last two rows with magnifications of x3.50k and x15k. \n\n4.4 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) \n\nThermogravimetric analysis was used to check the thermal behavior of the nanocomposite \n\nmembranes and of the corresponding individual components.  \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  34/56 \n\nThe pure BC membrane displayed a thermogram with a single weight loss profile, typical of \n\ncellulosic substrates, with an initial decomposition temperature around 270 \u00baC and a maximum \n\ndecomposition temperature at 348 \u00baC, corresponding to a weight loss of 47%. \n\nIn comparison, the poly(N-methacryloyl glycine) showed a double step weight loss profile and \n\nis less thermally stable than BC. Its first decomposition initiated around 170 \u00baC and reached its \n\nmaximum at 242 \u00baC (weight loss 15 %) and the main decomposition started around 325 \u00baC with \n\na maximum at 404 \u00baC and corresponded to a weight loss of 60%. \n\nAll the nanocomposites showed a three step weight loss profile displaying decompositions due \n\nto both BC and the acrylate polymer. All membranes started to degrade at around 190 \u00baC and \n\nreached their first maximum decomposition between 232-242 \u00baC. The second degradation step \n\nof the membranes corresponded to the decomposition of BC and began at 253 \u00baC and 264 \u00baC \n\nindicating a diminution of the stability compared to BC. The last observed decomposition step \n\nwas due to the polymer enriched fraction degradation and started around 365 \u00baC for all the \n\nmembranes. \n\nAdditionally, one can notice an increase of the weight loss associated to the polymer \n\ndegradation with the increasing amount of polymer introduced into the membranes. \n\nIn sum, with a thermal degradation starting at around 190 \u00baC instead of 170 \u00baC for the \n\nhomopolymer the membranes can be considered more thermally stable than the PMGly itself. \n\nThis increase in thermal stability can be ascribed to the good compatibility between BC and the \n\npolymer and the interactions established between them. \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  35/56 \n\n \n\nFigure 24 - Thermograms and the corresponding derivatives of BC, PMGly, and BC_PMGly \n\nnanocomposites. \n\n4.5 Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) \n\nDMA was performed to investigate the mechanical and viscoelastic properties of the \n\nnanocomposite membranes. Figure 25 displays the storage modulus (E\u2019) and the tangent ? (tan \n\n?) of pure BC and of the different nanocomposites. \n\nFirst, as one can perceive that pure BC displayed a storage modulus around 5.1 GPa almost in \n\nall temperature range, whereas the different membranes seem to have lower storage modulus \n\nbetween 1 and 1.5 GPa for the 1:1 and 1:2 membranes, and between 1.5 and 2.5 GPa for the 1:3 \n\nmembrane. This reduction in storage capacity compared to pure BC is due to the addition of an \n\namorphous polymer into BC\u2019s network. In addition, the membranes appeared to have higher \n\nstorage capacity in the lower range of temperature (-50 \u00baC ? 70 \u00baC). \n\nSecondly, thanks to the analysis of the evolution of the tan ? in function of the temperature, one \n\ncan notice the absence of glass transition, therefore highlighting the crystallinity of the \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  36/56 \n\nnanocomposites, already observed in X-Ray analysis. Indeed, as pure BC, all the three \n\nnanocomposites display a tan ? varying linearly with the temperature and without any evident \n\nmaximum. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 25 - Storage modulus and tan ? in function of the temperature of BC and BC \n\nnanocomposites obtained by DMA analysis in tension mode. The tan ? curves were smoothed with \n\nOrigin.  \n\n4.6 Tensile tests \n\nTensile tests were performed for the different obtained nanocomposites and on pure BC to \n\ncharacterise the mechanical properties of the membranes and to determine the influence of the \n\nnanocomposites\u2019 composition on their mechanical properties. Figure 26 summarizes the \n\ndifferences in Young\u2019s modulus, tensile strength and elongation at break between all samples \n\n(BC and BC/PMGly nanocomposites).  \n\nAll the studied nanocomposites membranes showed reduced mechanical properties when \n\ncompared to pure BC as revealed by their lower Young\u2019s modulus and tensile stress values. \n\nThis is obviously due to the introduction of an amorphous polymer into the 3D network of BC \n\nas previously observed for the DMA results. \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  37/56 \n\nAdditionally, by comparing the results from the different nanocomposites, one can notice that \n\nregarding the Young\u2019s modulus, the lower the amount of polymer the stiffer is the membrane. \n\nWith a Young\u2019s modulus of 4.93 GPa, and a tensile strength of 19.92 MPa the BC_PMGly 1:1 \n\nmembrane is the stiffer membrane. In comparison, the BC_PMGly 1:2 and 1:3 have a Young\u2019s \n\nmodulus and a tensile strength of respectively 4.45 GPa and 3.55 GPa, and 10.78 and 11.98 \n\nGPa. Regarding, the elongation at break, one can notice that no significant difference can be \n\nobserved, however, the BC_PMGly 1:1 nanocomposites presented the higher deformation \n\nbefore break. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 26 - Tensile stress, Young\u2019s modulus and elongation at break comparison in function of the \n\nsample. a) Comparison between BC and the nanocomposites, b) Comparison only between the \n\nnanocomposites. \n\n4.7 Swelling ratio \n\nThe swelling behavior of the nanocomposite membranes was analyzed by measuring their water \n\nuptake after drying. Figure 27 shows the evolution of the obtained swelling ratios in function of \n\ntime, and Figure 28 displays the FTIR spectrum of one nanocomposite before and after the \n\nswelling test. \n\nSeveral oscillations are clearly perceptible in the swelling graphs. This behavior was attributed \n\nto the dissolution of the non-reticulated polymer, as in fact confirmed by FTIR (Figure 28). It is \n\nperceptible a clear decrease of the intensity of the peaks corresponding to the acrylate polymer \n\n(between 1720 and 1530 cm-1) compared to the intensity of the peaks of BC (around 1000 cm-1). \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  38/56 \n\nIn conclusion, the polymer in the nanocomposites is not cross-linked enough to be retained into \n\nthe membrane in case of a too long immersion into water. Therefore, in this situation it is \n\ndifficult to evaluate this parameter and compare the different samples. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 27 - Swelling ratios of BC, and BC_PMGly nanocomposites; Logarithmic fitting was applied \n\nwith Excel. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 28 - FTIR spectra of the BC_PMGly 1:3 nanocomposite before and after the swelling tests. \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  39/56 \n\n4.8 MTT test \n\nMTT test was performed to assess the cytotoxicity of the nanocomposites. Figure 29 shows the \n\npreparation of the extract from the nanocomposites membranes. One can notice that the extract \n\nfrom BC_PMGly 1:3 appears to have a more reddish color than BC and BC_PMGly 1:1. This \n\nreddish color is synonym of a more acid medium (the Dulbecco?s Modified Eagle?s Medium, \n\nDMEM, is usually pink when neutral). In our case, the acidic medium is due to a large amount \n\nof polymer (with carboxylic acid moieties). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 29 - Preparation of the extract, 6 cm\u00b2 membranes dissolved in DMEM media. \n\n \n\nAfter being incubated for 24 hours, as explained in the experimental section, the three extracts \n\ncoming from each membrane were grouped in conical tubes (Figure 30). Moreover, due to the \n\nstrong concentration of polymer the filtration of the extract was not successful and this one was \n\nused as obtained after the dissolution of the polymer into the medium. As seen on Figure 30, the \n\nacidic character of the polymer is characterized by a clear yellow solution. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 30 - Visual aspects of the a) PMGly extract, and b) (from left to right) BC, BC-PMGly 1:1, \n\nBC_PMGly 1:3 extracts. \n\n \n\nFigure 31 shows the 96 wells plate filled with the cells and the extract before the incubation and \n\nthe Table 5 displays the schematic representation of each well. \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  40/56 \n\n \n\nTable 5 : Schematic representation of the plate \n\nM M M M M M M M \n\nM \nM + \n\ncells \n\ncells + BC \n\nextract \n\ncells + 1:1 \n\nextract \n\ncells + 1:3 \n\nextract \n\ncells + polymer \n\nextract \nM M \n\nM \nM + \n\ncells \ncells + BC \n\ncells + 1:1 \n\nextract \n\ncells + 1:3 \n\nextract \n\ncells + polymer \n\nextract \nM M \n\nM \nM + \n\ncells \ncells + BC \n\ncells + 1:1 \n\nextract \n\ncells + 1:3 \n\nextract \n\ncells + polymer \n\nextract \nM M \n\nM \nM + \n\ncells \ncells + BC \n\ncells + 1:1 \n\nextract \n\ncells + 1:3 \n\nextract \n\ncells + polymer \n\nextract \nM M \n\nM M M M M M M M \n\nWith M: media. \n\nThe wells with only the media were filled up in order to prevent the evaporation of the media in \n\nthe wells containing the cells and extracts. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 31 - 96 wells plate with the cell and the extract before incubation. \n\n \n\nThe Figure 32 shows the plate after the incubation during 4 hours with MTT.

Figure 33 shows the \n\nobtained results for the different membranes on the skin viability. \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  41/56 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 33 \u2013 Effects of BC, BC_PMGly 1:1, 1:3 and PMGly on the HaCaT cells for exposure time of \n\n24h, 48h and 72h. The results are presented as mean +/- standard deviation from 4 different \n\nspecimens per membrane. Symbol * represents significant difference between time of exposure for \n\nthe same membrane (p<0.05). Different letters represent significant differences between one \n\nmembrane and the control, or one membrane and another membrane for each exposure time \n\n(p<0.05). \n\n \n\nFirst of all, the results showed that the polymer induced almost 100% cell mortality. This is \n\ncertainly due to the high concentration of polymer directly dissolved in the media during the \n\npreparation of the extract and also due to the impossibility of sterilize this extract; and therefore \n\nhave poor significance. \n\nNevertheless, using the two way ANOVA, followed by the Holm-Sidak test, it appears that the \n\n3 membranes (BC, BC_PMGly 1:1, BC_PMGly 1:3) were not significantly different from the \n\ncontrol for an exposure time of 24 hours. One can therefore state, that those membranes are non-\n\ncytotoxic to HaCaT after 24 hours of exposition. Additionally, the statistical analysis made on \n\nthe results from 48 hours of exposition revealed that BC, and BC_PMGly 1:3 have cell viability \n\nof respectively 76% and 72%, whereas the BC_PMGly 1:1 is again considered as non-cytotoxic. \n\nMoreover, after 72 hours of exposition, BC, BC_PMGly 1:1 and BC_PMGly 1:3 had cell \n\nviability of respectively 82%, 79% and 68%. \n\nFinally, the two-way ANOVA test also allowed us to say that the exposure time had no effect \n\non the cell viability of BC, but that it had influence on that of the two nanocomposites since for \n\nboth of them, the 72 hours test were significantly different from the 24 hours and the 48 hours. \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  42/56 \n\n4.9 Drug delivery essays \n\nPure BC membranes had been investigated as transdermal drug delivery systems with several \n\ndrug as for example diclofenac and lidocaine. [3], [33], [37], [39] However, for oral delivery it \n\nis important to tailor the drug release as a function of pH, for example to avoid drug degradation \n\nat lower pHs. In this line, we decided to test our nanocomposites as drug (diclofenac) delivery \n\nsystems in both acidic and neutral conditions because of their pH sensitivity. \n\n \n\nDiclofenac, 2-(2-(2,6-dichlorophenylamino)phenyl)acetic acid (DCF), which chemical structure \n\nis shown in the Figure 34, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. It is mainly used to relief \n\nmoderate suffering such as headache, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or short term clinical \n\noperations, by reducing the substances that causes pain and inflammation. [37], [74] \n\n \n\nFigure 34 - Diclofenac chemical structure. \n\n \n\nWe have chosen to work on diclofenac in order to be able to compare its release from our new \n\nnanocomposites and its release from pure BC membrane. [37] \n\n \n\nImpregnation of the drug \n\nFirst, it can be observed in the Figure 35 that after the drug impregnation, the obtained dried \n\nmembrane is whiter than the original nanocomposite, confirming the absorption of the drug by \n\nthe membrane. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 35 - Visual aspect of the dried BC_PMGly1:3_DCF membrane after the impregnation of the \n\ndrug. \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  43/56 \n\nFigure 36 compares the FTIR spectrum of both nanocomposites before and after impregnation \n\nand diclofenac alone. \n\nThe FTIR spectrum of diclofenac displays several typical absorption peaks, specifically at 3390 \n\ncm?1 (N-H stretching), 3030 and 3079 cm-1 (=C-H aromatics), 1572 cm?1 (COO anti-\n\nsymmetrical vibration), 1603 cm?1 (C=C ring skeletal vibration), 1350\u20131250cm?1 (C-N \n\nstretching), and 710\u2013745 cm-1 (C-H out of plane, di- and tri- substituted rings). [37] \n\nTherefore, the impregnation of the drug can be further confirmed by the appearance of the \n\ntypical DCF peaks on the spectrum of the impregnated nanocomposite. Indeed, one can easily \n\ndistinct on this spectrum the three sharp peaks at 714, 744 and 764 cm-1 corresponding to the out \n\nof plane vibration from the C-H of the aromatic rings and the two peaks at 1280 and 1303 cm-1 \n\nmatching the stretching of the C-N bonds of diclofenac molecules. However, due to overlapping \n\nor interactions established between diclofenac and the nanocomposites (as suggested by the \n\nspectra of the mixture of the PMGly and diclofenac, PMGly + DCF), some peaks have been \n\nshifted. It is the case for example for the 1715 cm-1 (C=O) peak of PMGly that is shifted to 1684 \n\ncm-1 and the one at 1621 cm-1 which moved to 1601 cm-1. Nevertheless, this behaviour must be \n\ninvestigated in more detail. \n\n \n\nFigure 36 - FTIR-ATR spectra of BC, PMGly, DCF and BC_PMGly1:3_DCF. \n\n \n\nDrug release test \n\nThe diclofenac release from the nanocomposite membranes was tested at pH 7.4 and 2.1 during \n\n24 hours at 37 \u00b0C for two different membranes prepared with different amounts of cross-linker \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  44/56 \n\n(MBA), namely 5% and 10% (compared to the amount of monomer) because of the results \n\nobtained for the swelling tests. To assess the drug release, the absorbance\u2019s of the solutions \n\nwere assessed every hour. Their evolution in function of time are displayed in the Figure 37 and \n\nthe FTIR-ATR spectrum of the different nanocomposites before and after the test are shown in \n\nFigure 38. \n\n \n\nAfter observing in the swelling test that part of the polymer can be dissolved from the \n\nnanocomposite, we decided to investigate by FTIR this dissolution after the release test. The \n\nresults, with both amount of cross linker, showed the disappearance of the polymer from the \n\nmembranes in the case of pH 7.4. Indeed, no typical peaks such as the PMGly/DCF peaks \n\naround 1689 cm-1 or the DCF typical ones around 764 cm-1 are presents on the spectrum. In the \n\ncase of pH 2.1, the FTIR spectrum obtained from the nanocomposites are more similar to the \n\none of the initial membrane, nevertheless, the reduce intensity of the polymer peaks compared \n\nto that of BC suggest a reduction of the polymer amount into the nanocomposite membrane. \n\nMoreover, it has also been confirmed that the polymer absorbed at 276 nm, therefore, it is \n\nimpossible to link the absorbance of the solution to the drug concentration in the solution. \n\nHowever, we can conclude that the higher absorbance obtained at pH 7.4 suggest a higher \n\ndissolution of polymer and diclofenac in neutral conditions than in acidic pH. \n\nIn sum, a new way to perform the diclofenac release has to be found, in order to prevent the \n\ndissolution of the polymer. This could be done with even higher amounts of cross-linker. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 37 - Comparison of the absorbance evolution in function of time at pH 7.4 and 2.1 for the \n\nBC _PMGly (1:3)_DCF and BC_PMGly (1:3:10)_DCF nanocomposites; fitting was computed with \n\nExcel. \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  45/56 \n\n \n\nFigure 38 - FTIR-ATR spectra of BC and BC_PMGly1:3_DCF before and after release test at \n\ndifferent pH (7.4 and 2.1) with different amount of cross linker (5% and 10%) \n\n4.10 Biomineralization of the nanocomposites \n\nBones are mainly composed of hydroxyapatite (HAp) nanocrystals and collagen. HAp is well \n\nknown for its great osteoconductivity and bioactivity, whereas collagen is known for its \n\nsusceptibility to mutation. [75] Therefore, even if HAp/collagen nanocomposites have been \n\nstudied, [76]\u2013[80] efforts have been made in order to find a material that could overcome \n\ncollagen\u2019s issues and BC/HAp and polymeric/HAp nanocomposites have been synthesised and \n\ncharacterised. [25], [43], [46], [69], [81] BC has been chosen for its peculiar porosity, \n\nmechanical properties, biocompatibility and biodegradability. In that direction, our objective \n\nwas to initiate biomimetic apatite formation on our membranes, in order to create a new porous \n\nHAp_BC_PMGly nanocomposite with enhanced properties. \n\n \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  46/56 \n\nTwo nanocomposites membranes (both of them were BC_PMGly nanocomposite with a \n\nBC:monomer ratio of 1:2 however, one of them was freeze dried after polymerization and the \n\nother one was kept in wet state) were biomineralized following the methods described in the \n\nsection 3.5. After the biomineralization, half of each membrane was freeze dried and the other \n\nhalf oven dried at 40 \u00b0C. At the end, four different nanocomposites were obtained. Table 6 \n\nsummarizes the different chosen designation of the samples in function of the applied treatment. \n\nThe growth of any minerals was controlled by XRD and SEM. \n\n \n\nTable 6: Designation of the different biomineralized samples \n\n \nAfter polymerization After biomineralization \n\nFreeze dried Kept in wet state Freeze dried Oven dried \n\nBC_PMGly 1:2 WOD  X  X \n\nBC_PMGly 1:2 WFD  X X  \n\nBC_PMGly 1:2 FDOV X   X \n\nBC_PMGly 1:2 FDFD X   X \n\n4.10.1 X-ray diffraction \n\nX-ray diffractograms of the obtained nanocomposites are shown in Figure 39. The typical \n\ndiffractions of BC are not very intense in these diffractograms due to the appearance of two \n\nintense peaks at 32.1\u00b0, 45.8\u00b0. These peaks were attributed to NaCl in its cubic form for all the \n\nsamples using the software High Score version 4.1, suggesting that the formation of \n\nhydroxyapatite did not occur in considerable extension.  \n\n \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  47/56 \n\n \n\nFigure 39 - XRD diffractograms of the different biomineralized nanocomposites. \n\n4.10.2 Scanning electron microscopy \n\nThe surfaces of the obtained nanocomposites were then analyzed by SEM in order to check the \n\nformation of NaCl and, therefore, confirm the results obtained by XRD. Some micrographs at \n\nmagnification of x10k and x30k are shown in the Figure 40 and Figure 41. Additionally, the \n\nelements found by EDX analysis are listed with their estimated amount in the Table 7, while a \n\ntypical EDX spectrum is shown in Figure 42. \n\nThe formation of mineral particles, indicated by XRD, was confirmed in SEM by the \n\nobservation of some spherical and cubic shape inorganic particles on the surface of BC fibers \n\n(Figure 40 and Figure 41). In the same way, the EDX results confirmed the higher abundance of \n\nchlorine and sodium in all the different nanocomposites corroborating the growth of NaCl. \n\nHowever, the very small or inexistent amount of phosphate and calcium found by EDX again \n\nsuggest that the hydroxyapatite hasn\u2019t grown in significant amount. These experiments need to \n\nbe repeated and improved aiming to avoid the formation of NaCl that certainly the HAp growth. \n\n \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  48/56 \n\n \n\nFigure 40 - SEM pictures of a) BC-PMGly 1-2_FDFD, b) BC_PMGly 1:2_FDOD, c) BC_PMGly \n\n1:2_WFD, d) BC_PMGly 1:2 WOD at a magnification of x10k \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 41 - SEM pictures of a) BC-PMGly 1-2_FDFD, b) BC_PMGly 1:2_FDOD, c) BC_PMGly \n\n1:2_WFD, d) BC_PMGly 1:2 WOD at a magnification of x30k \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  49/56 \n\n \n\nTable 7: List of the different elements and their concentrations found in the nanocomposites, the \n\nconcentrations are given in wt%.

Conclusions \n\nIn this study, we were able to create novel nanocomposites through the in situ free radical \n\npolymerization of N-methacryloyl glycine into the three dimensional network of bacterial \n\ncellulose using N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide as cross-linker. \n\nThis embedment of the polymer into BC resulted into an increase of the mechanical and thermal \n\nproperties of the polymer confirming reinforcement ability of BC. Moreover, due to the \n\namorphous character of the polymer, the obtained nanocomposites had reduced crystallinity and \n\nmechanical properties when compared to BC. \n\nBy analysing the influence of the polymer content we can say that increasing amounts of \n\npolymer induced a higher filling of the pores of BC resulting in higher nanocomposite \n\nthicknesses. However, the increase of the polymer content had no significant impact on the \n\nthermal stability of the nanocomposites.  \n\nIn addition, the polymer incorporation into BC successfully produced non-cytotoxic materials \n\nup to 48 hours of exposure regarding to skin cells and with more than 70% of cell viability for \n\n72 hours of exposure. It was also observed that the increase of the amount of polymer caused a \n\ndecrease of the cell viability regarding HaCaT skin cell after more than 24 hours of exposure.  \n\nFrom all nanocomposite prepared, BC_PMGly 1:1 is the one with the highest cell viability, \n\nmechanical resistance and crystallinity. \n\nIn terms of the potential applications, we have successfully impregnated diclofenac into our \n\nnanocomposites membranes and were able to release the drug with a controlled behaviour at \n\nboth pH 7.4 and 2.1. However, we have noticed the dissolution of the polymer during the \n\nrelease tests. In addition, the biomineralization of the nanocomposites from a simulated body \n\nsolution did not led to the growth of hydroxyapatite particles on our membranes. Indeed, XRD \n\nand SEM analysis have confirmed the growth of NaCl particles, possibly due to water \n\ncontamination in the lab. \n\nIn the future, further analyses will be made to complete the characterisation of the \n\nnanocomposites; for instance, solid state NMR will be performed on the different membranes \n\nand the effect of the polymer introduction on the cell adhesion will be studied by SEM. \n\nAdditionally, the diclofenac release will be tested with higher amounts of cross-linker, and high-\n\nperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) will be used to characterize better the previous \n\nreleases. Regarding the biomineralization, tests will be repeated with pure water to assess the \n\ncontamination of the sample by NaCl before the reaction and in case of an effective HAp \n\ngrowth, compressive test will be performed on the membranes. Finally, a new potential \n\napplication of the nanocomposite in the field of water purification will also be investigated. \n\n\n\nBacterial cellulose /poly (N-methacryloyl glycine) prepared by in situ polymerization for biomedical applications  51/56 \n\n6.
