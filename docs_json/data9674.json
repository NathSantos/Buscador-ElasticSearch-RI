Here, the peritidal\ncarbonates of the Ch\u00e3o das Pias Formation (Middle Jurassic, upper Bajocian)\nrecord the development of microbial mats in a tidal flat. Episodically, the\nflat was expanded during periods of equinoctial spring tides that may have\nbeen responsible for the in situ killing of several members of echinoderm\nclades, and the fine preservation of their endoskeleton, in addition to the\nbehavior of an arthropod-dominated endo- and epifauna. Mat-preserved\nshallow tiers with a moderate ichnodiversity attributed to the Cruziana\nichnofacies include trackways of crabs (Laterigradus lusitanica igen. nov.,\nisp. nov.) and shrimps (Diplopodichnus isp.); trails of fishes (?Undichna),\ngastropods (Archaeonassa fossulata), isocrinid crinoids (Krinodromos bentou\nigen. nov., isp. nov.) and insects (Haplotichnus indianensis); and burrows\nof shrimps or lobsters (Thalassinoides suevicus) and other arthropods\n(Asterosoma ludwigae, Gyrochorte comosa), or polychaetes (Rhizocorallium\ncommune). This is implied already above (igen. nov., etc.) and seems not\nneeded. The crab trackways and gastropod bulldozing trails, extending up\nto 12.3 m, are among the longest invertebrate cursorial traces ever found in\nthe fossil record. The mortichnial crawling trail of a crinoid is the first\nevidence of locomotion for this group in the fossil record, and a rare\nunambiguous example of this ethology. Extensive continuous trackways\nattributed to amphibious crabs record, with great detail, typical gaits of\nunderwater punting and walking sideways on dry land. The earliest\nevidences of sidewalking behavior may also be evidence for the development\nof the crab form during their rise in the Jurassic.\n\nKeywords: Ichnology; tidal flat; walking sideways; amphibious brachyurans;\ncrinoid mortichnion; Bajocian\n\nResumo: A Icnologia \u00e9 um poderoso instrumento para a compreens\u00e3o das\netapas evolutivas de clados de animais atrav\u00e9s da paleobiologia do\ncomportamento inscrito em s\u00edtios paleontol\u00f3gicos excepcionais, como o\nCabe\u00e7o da Ladeira (Portugal).

However, even in completely different\ngroups of organisms, convergent behaviors are generated in an\nequivalent pool of genetic solutions under similar environmental\nconditions (universality sensu Barzel and Barab\u00e1si, 2013).\nNevertheless, each animal species possesses its own neural\nmechanism which, for pattern-selective processes, means subtle\ndifferences in the mode of reaction to stimuli from related species.\nOn the other hand, behavior may evolve divergently when subjected\nto different selection pressures through time. The substantial\nmodification of behavior due to constant adaptation to ecological\nchanges through time and coevolution, may generate a functional\nchange by aptation, if this increases reproductive success of the\nspecies (Vermeij, 1987; Boucot, 1990). Biological behavior,\nwhenever preserved in the fossil record, was impacted by genetic\nadaptations, by the original environmental and ecological\nparameters, diagenetic overprints and even, in some ancient cases,\ntectonic strain (Neto de Carvalho, 2011). Ichnology, the discipline\ncoping with the analysis of organism-sedimentary environment\ninteractions (description, classification and interpretation), is a\nfundamental link between biological mechanisms and geological\nprocesses (Plotnick, 2012). Trace fossils combine functional\nmorphology and behavior of producers, but also the physical-\nchemical properties of the original environment-related substrate.\nOnly in remarkable examples of those, it is possible to obtain\nsubstantial data on the ecology, functional morphology and behavior\nthat ultimately lead to detailed knowledge of the soft-bodied or\nlight-armored  (behavioral or behavior is spelled the American way\nconsistently producer. Therefore, ichnosites with an extraordinary\nquality and quantity of ichnological information are known as\nichnolagerst\u00e4tten (Savrda, 2007).\n\nRecently, an exceptional new site was identified in the Middle\nJurassic of Portugal, and has been studied by a multidisciplinary\nteam. On about 4000 m2 quarry exposure, some of the longest and\ncontinuous crawling trails and trackways ever described in the\ninvertebrate fossil record were found. Large numbers of fully-\narticulated echinoderms are the most common macrofauna at this\nsite (Pereira et al., 2014a,b; Pereira, 2015). Both trace and body\nfossils hold high paleobiological importance, due to their\nremarkable fine preservation, age, rarity on rocks from similar age\nand their high abundance. Cabe\u00e7o da Ladeira records a shallow-tier\npreservation of trackways and trails, and different echinoderm\nclades in anatomical full- or semi-articulation, due to the presence\nof extensive microbial mats whose evidences are also widespread\nat the site (see below).\n\nThe aim of this paper is to report on various horizontal trace\nfossils predominantly preserved on the bedding plane that are\npresent at the same beds as the well-preserved echinoderms. We\ndiscuss their evolutionary and behavioral implications, namely the\nacquisition of morphological exaptations that enabled new modes\nof locomotion and ultimately, the colonization of new habitats. The\nmoderately diversified ichnoassemblage is composed mostly of\narthropod trackways, trails and burrows. They include the earliest\ntrackways indicating the presence of amphibious true crabs walking\nsideways in the Middle Jurassic, very long and almost linear\nbulldozing trails attributed to gastropods moving in the ebb tide,\nand the very first locomotion trails left by stalked crinoids in the\nfossil record. \n\n2. Stratigraphy of the Cabe\u00e7o da Ladeira fossil site\n\nThe site of Cabe\u00e7o da Ladeira is located about 2 km to the north of\nthe locality of S\u00e3o Bento, municipality of Porto de M\u00f3s, in the\n\nSerras de Aires e Candeeiros Natural Park (Fig.1). This area lies\nwithin a regional structure called Maci\u00e7o Calc\u00e1rio Estremenho,\nlocated in the central area of the Lusitanian Basin. The Lusitanian\nBasin is located along the western Iberian margin and resulted from\nextension related to the opening of the North Atlantic. The\nsedimentary record of this rift basin is oriented NNE-SSW along\n200 km and 100 km wide, with a maximum thickness of 4 to 5 km.\nThe Maci\u00e7o Calc\u00e1rio Estremenho was uplifted by compressive\ntectonic forces, associated with the Alpine Orogeny (Kullberg et al.,\n2013). Its tectonic structure is generically divided into three elevated\nregions separated by elongated fault-related depressions, cropping\nout rocks from the Jurassic. The Lower Jurassic is restricted to\nnarrow salt walls where Hettangian evaporites occur. On the other\nhand, the Middle Jurassic consists of bright colored limestones,\nexposed on the top of the elevated regions. They were formed in\ndifferent paleoenvironments at a carbonate ramp depositional\nsystem (inner ramp: Azer\u00eado, 1998, 2007). The Upper Jurassic is\ncharacterized by limestones and marls, with colors varying from\nbrown to grey, appearing on tectonically controlled, depressed areas.\nWith the exception of the rocks in the vicinity of the main faults,\nbeds are sub-horizontal. The geosite Cabe\u00e7o da Ladeira is within\n\none of those elevated structures, known as the Santo Ant\u00f3nio\nplateau, exposing rocks from the Middle Jurassic period. \n\nAccording to Azer\u00eado (2007), it is possible to observe, from the\nbase to the top, the Barranco do Zambujal Formation (Aalenian-\nlower Bajocian), the Calc\u00e1rios de Vale da Serra Member (upper\nBajocian) from the Ch\u00e3o das Pias Formation and the Coda\u00e7al\nMember (lower Bathonian) from the Santo Ant\u00f3nio-Candeeiros\nFormation. The Cabe\u00e7o da Ladeira succession is exposing upper\nBajocian sediments from the Vale da Serra Member of the Ch\u00e3o das\nPias Formation (Sauzei biozone; Ruget-Perrot, 1961). With a\nthickness of 50-to-60 m, the sequence is formed by greyish yellow\nmarly limestones and clayish limestones (mudstone and wackestone\nmicrites and biomicrites with ammonoids and echinoderms) in the\nlower part. Towards the top, a gradual transition to calciclastic and\ndolomitic limestones, wackestone and packstone intrapelmicrites\nand biopelmicrites occur (Azer\u00eado, 1998). The increasing\nintercalation, from east to west and from the base of the sequence\n\nFig. 1. Geological map of Maci\u00e7o Calc\u00e1rio Estremenho with the location of the site\nunder study (adapted from Carvalho, 2013; Pereira et al., 2014a).\n\nFig. 1. Mapa geol\u00f3gico do Maci\u00e7o Calc\u00e1rio Estremenho com a localiza\u00e7\u00e3o do local em\nestudo (adaptado de Carvalho, 2013; Pereira et al., 2014a).\n\n\n\nTrackways from the Mid Jurassic of Cabe\u00e7o da Ladeira 41\n\nto its upper part, of dolomitized oobioclastic, massive dolomite and\ndolomite laminated levels, testimony a regressive trend in facies,\nwith progradation of shallower conditions with microbial-algal mats\n(Azer\u00eado et al., 2003).\n\nAt the quarry, the succession is composed of seven different cm-\nscale limestone beds (Fig. 2) deposited under very shallow subtidal-\nto-intertidal conditions, with episodic short-term aerial exposure\nwithout evidence for the development of soils. Newly exposed rock\nhas a white to beige color, but acquires a dark grey and yellow-to-\norange color due to the exposure to weathering agents and the\ngrowth of lichens. Thin clay layers are also present between some\nof these limestone layers and filling some epichnial trails. The rocks,\nmostly limestones, range from mudstone to wackstone, with a\nvariable component of peloids, bioclasts and intraclasts (Fig. 3). \n\nThe clast size varies between and within layers. Intralayer\nvariations are often very sharp and associated with erosion surfaces.\nErosion surfaces and truncations are also quite evident, with a\nnormal grading. Laterally, grain size can vary rapidly. Nevertheless,\nit is possible to observe a slight decrease in layer thickness and\noverall grain size towards the top of the section. On the upper\nsurface of some limestone layers there are beautifully preserved\nripple marks. These ripples occupy a significant area of this locality,\nbeing separated in two groups, with parallel or anastomosing crests\n(Fig. 3A). The parallel ripples appear to have symmetric sides, and\nare mostly oriented NNW-SSE. Microbial-mat-related structures\n(Seilacher, 2008; Noffke, 2010) are abundant, represented by a\nlower, mineral-rich layer: big wrinkle structures are preserved in\nbed 6 (Fig. 3G) and palimpsest, multidirectional ripples are found\nin bed 2; elephant skin, mud (mat) chips, \u201cfoam\u201d structures and\nshrinkage cracks are spread all over the fine iron-rich laminate\nlevelling structures that partially covers long trackways in bed 3\n(Fig. 3D). The recurrent presence of microbial mat-related structures\nin the sequence shows that the deposition took place in very shallow\nconditions of the carbonate mudflat. However, echinoderms are\nabundant and indicative of subtidal environments. Nevertheless,\nsudden environmental changes were responsible for their death\nmostly in life position and the preservation of almost intact\narticulated skeletons (Fig. 3A). Rill marks cut the microbial mat\nstructures and cross the ripple marks in mainly SW direction. They\nare good indicators of the lower foreshore above the low tide (Fig.\n3H). Deep-imprinted trails and trackways crossing the mudflat show\nepisodes of aerial exposure that may have been related to spring\ntides that periodically exposed wider areas from the lower intertidal-\nupper subtidal. Growth of biomats usually occurs in harsh and\nhypersaline environments uninhabitable for most burrowing\norganisms (Knaust et al., 2012) and therefore provides excellent\nsubstrate conditions, through the formation of leathery semi-rigid\ntop layers, for survivorship and preservation of those delicate\ntrackways (De, 2014; Fig. 3F) and shallow-tiered burrows.\n\nMore than a hundred echinoderm specimens have been\nidentified at this locality, with the potential for increasing the\nnumber (Pereira, 2015). The echinoderms appear more or less\nscattered evenly throughout the exposed rock area. All seven beds\nexposed in the quarry are bioturbated, and beds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 have\nechinoderm fossils. So far, beds 5 and 6 did not yield any echinoderm\nfossils. However, the exposed area of these two layers is substantially\nsmaller than the other beds, so they may also contain fossils. In the\nvast majority of the cases, echinoderms are preserved semi-\narticulated, with rare cases of isolated spines and disassociated\nplates of echinoids. In many cases, only the external molds of\nechinoderms are present, with the actual fossil no longer present\neither due to erosion or rock quarrying activity. The echinoderm\nfossils found on that site belong to four distinct echinoderm classes\n(by order of abundance): the Echinoidea, including Heterocidaris\nsp. nov., Stomechinus bigranularis (Lamarck, 1816), Stomechinus\n\nsp., ?Gymnodiadema hessi Smith, 2011, Paracidaris spinulosa\n(Cotteau, 1875) and Rhabdocidaris spp.; the Asteroidea, with\nNoviaster sp. nov. and indetermined goniasterid; the Crinoidea,\nshowing few isocrinid and possible ?comatulid representatives; and\nOphiuroidea indet. (Pereira, 2015). Along with fossil echinoderms,\nrare bivalves and brachiopods are also present. The extraordinary\npreservation of these echinoderms, which are not commonly\nresistant to post-mortem processes, is typically associated with high\nsedimentary rates and rapid burial, as well as little transport (Baumiller\net al., 2008).\n\nFollowing the observations of M\u00e1ngano and Buatois (2004) for\nbioturbation in tidal flats, the Bajocian open-marine tidal flat of\nCabe\u00e7o da Ladeira developed on a carbonate ramp characterized\nby: 1) moderate ichnodiversity; 2) marine trace and body fossils of\nstenohaline forms, such as echinoderms and the elements of the\nCruziana ichnofacies; 3) the presence of both infaunal (burrows)\nand epifaunal traces (trackways and trails); 4) the presence of both\ntrophic generalists (Archaeonassa) and specialists (Thalassinoides,\nAsterosoma); 5) the dominance of horizontal trace fossils of the\nCruziana ichnofacies, such as Thalassinoides, Rhizocorallium and\nGyrochorte; 6) the presence of multispecific ichnoassociations; 7)\nthe high levels of bioturbation, especially for Thalassinoides and\nArchaeonassa; and 8) the wide size range, as can be found for small\nand large types of Thalassinoides.\n\nThe remarkable preservation of trackways may be explained by\nstress factors that may have isolated the mixed layer from subsequent\nbioturbation (Pirrie et al., 2004). The associated ichnofauna shows\nthe common development of firmgrounds in a shallow-tiered\nGlossifungites-type ichnofacies (MacEachern et al., 1992). \n\nFig. 2.

The earliest sideways walking crab trails\n\n3.1 Evidences for a crab-form tracemaker and the evolution of\n\nsideways locomotion\n\nThe Cabe\u00e7o da Ladeira site possesses a remarkable preservation of\nvery long trackways and trails crossing the microbial-mat related\nstructures and ripple-marks that cover some of the beds, especially\nbeds 2 and 3. Trackways represent single and fast excursions across\nthe tidal flat by a multi-legged animal. The longest one measures\n12.30 m and may be the longest fossil invertebrate trackway known\nin the world (Fig. 4A,B; see below). The trackway slightly curves\nalong its course. It is composed by sets of up to four footprints,\nexternally measuring 65 mm wide (Fig. 4C). Footprints are pit- to\nsigmoid-shaped, 3 to 25 mm long, showing different preservational\nconditions and depths related with heteropody (Seilacher, 2008).\nAlong the trackway sets of up to twelve prints sometimes occur,\nforming a circular pattern that can be interpreted as probing behavior,\nthrough the use of sharp dactyls for chemoperception (sensu Sch\u00e4fer,\n1972; Fig. 4D). Together with the four-footprint sets, the stride lengths\nof 40-80 mm and metachronal gait clearly suggest an aerial style of\nlocomotion. Based on the evidences presented, these trackways were\nmost likely made by an amphibious decapod crustacean\nmorphologically adapted for walking and running sideways (Fig. 5).\n\nIn the morphology of decapod crustaceans, thorax elongation is the\nmost important feature, together with leg length, lateral flattening and\nplacement at rest, to reflect the walking preference (Vidal-Gadea et al.,\n2008). The most successful evolutionary trend of crabs and some crab-\nlike anomurans (e.g., Porcellanidae) was the progressive reduction of\nthe long and vulnerable abdomen, which reduces drag and greatly\nhinders faster locomotion, alongside the inflexion of the reduced\nabdomen against the sternum (F\u00f6rster, 1985), which favored the\ndevelopment of the crab form and sideward locomotion. Supported by\nphylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences, and gene rearrangements,\nMorrison et al. (2002) suggested that the evolution of the crab-like form\nand, therefore walking sideways, had five independent origins in\nbottom-dwelling crustacean decapods, the most successful one in the\nBrachyura, and four others in the Anomura (Porcellanidae, Paguroidea,\nCoenobitoidea and Lomis). Sideward walking provided crabs the\nunique advantage of being equally fast in opposite directions through\nincreasing multilegged stride length (Vidal-Gadea et al., 2008).\nActually, the ecological dispersion of brachyurans to land habitats may\nhave been aided by the use of sideways octopedal locomotion (Full and\nHerreid, 1984). Not all brachyuran crabs can walk sideways. In such\ngait, pairs of the four leading limbs are used in combination with\nalternating pairs of trailing limbs, which may result in longer, sigmoidal\nimprints in the substrate. The leg joints articulate along consecutively\nperpendicular planes. This possibly was an exaptation for the evolution\nof walking sideways (Vidal-Gadea et al., 2008).\n\nThe main trail attributed to gastropods (Fig. 4) is followed at\nleast for half of its length by a crab trackway more than 4 m long\nand 65 mm wide. This trackway is composed of sets of 2-3\nelongated footprints with a stride length of 140-170 mm (Fig. 4G).\nBesides this example, there are at least two more trackways in\nCabe\u00e7o da Ladeira showing evidence of a punting gait under water\n(sensu Martinez et al., 1998; see Fig. 9G). Crabs walking sideways\nexperience drag forces perpendicular to their longitudinal axis. On\nland, crabs never have fewer than three legs in contact with the\nground at any time. Drag forces are partially offset by lifting forces\nunderwater due to buoyancy. Thus, legs touch the bottom less\nfrequently moving under water compared to locomotion on land, as\nobserved during lab experiments by Martinez et al. (1998). In\nunderwater punting locomotion, only 2-3 legs are in contact with\nthe ground at any time and leg kinematics is much more variable\nthan on land. This thrust and gliding motion can be clearly followed\nin some of the Cerro da Ladeira trackways (Fig. 4G, 5).\n\nThe crab trackways and the crawling trails attributed to\ngastropods show the same orientation of the rill marks perpendicular\nto the rippled microbial mat surface. According to the asymmetry\nof the imprints in the longest trackway, the crab may have walked\nin the opposite direction of the tide. The substantial depth of the\nfootprints, the use of at least four legs in walking or running, and\nthe carcasses of many echinoderms also suggest the aerial exposure\nof the flat during a low tide. Several faint parallel trackways were\nalso found under the microbial-mat layer (Fig. 4). In some places\nof the tidal flat it is possible to find circular mounds with a central\ncrater measuring 28-50 mm in diameter (Fig. 4E). These may be\ninterpreted as simple crab burrows used to protect the crab during\nthe low tide cycle, as we can find nowadays for the Similar-sized\nside-runner Carcinus maenas (Linnaeus, 1758) (Fig. 4F). The Green\ncrab is active during high tide, foraging on prey and grazing the\nalgal and microbial mats that develop at the sediment surface (Baeta\net al. 2006; CNC, pers. obs.). During low tide, they look for protection\nfrom predators and dehydration in simple burrows excavated by the\nleading limbs, using the wedge-shaped carapace to shovel the\nsediment above them. These transient burrows are abandoned every\ntime they feel endangered after which a new one is built. However,\nwe cannot exclude the possibility that these mounds may be related\nwith the Thalassinoides producer, whose burrow mazes are also\ncommon in the succession.\n\nThis study implements previous works on the application of\nichnology for understanding the evolution of crustaceans (Baucon et\nal., 2014). This shows that trace fossils with a distinctive bioprint\n(Kopaska-Merkel and Rindsberg, 2015) are useful for interpreting the\nevolutionary history of organisms with a relatively low preservation\npotential, such as arthropods with lightly mineralized exoskeletons.\n\n3.2 The earliest evidences of true crabs\n\nThe Early and Middle Jurassic fossil record of crabs is not very rich.\nUsing molecular phylogenetics, Tsang et al. (2014) suggested that\nBrachyura, as its sister group Anomura, would have been present\ntogether over 180 Ma ago. The superfamily Majoidea has the oldest\nlineage diverging 254 Ma ago, according to Porter et al. (2005), but\nthe oldest majoid fossils thus far are only mid-Cretaceous (late\nAlbian) in age (Klompmaker, 2013). Divergence time estimates for\nBrachyura by Tsang et al. (2014) are more conservative and suggest\naround 170-171 Ma. Nevertheless, the first brachyurans in the fossil\nrecord appeared in the Lower Jurassic (Pliensbachian; see\nSchweitzer and Feldmann, 2010; Haug and Haug, 2014). Krobicki\nand Zat\u00f3n (2008) suggested that the evolution of prosopid crabs\napparently began in Early Jurassic on shallow, soft bottom marine\nenvironments. Brachyuran diversification started slowly during the\nMiddle Jurassic (M\u00fcller et al., 2000; Klompmaker et al., 2013). No\ncrab species are known from the Toarcian or Aalenian. The earliest\ncrabs living in the subsequent Bajocian times were Pithonoton,\nEodromites, Gabriella, Tanidromites, Abyssophthalmus, Planoprosopon,\nEoprosopon and Foersteria, all based on European occurrences.\nWhile most of them have elongated carapaces and most likely walked\nforward, members of the genus Pithonoton show an ovoid or sub-\npentagonal carapace that that may suggest a sideward locomotion.\nHowever, one of the largest Jurassic crab, Eodromites grandis (von\nMeyer, 1857) hardly exceeds 30 mm (dataset, Klompmaker et al.,\n2015), which is significantly small to have produced the observed\ntrackways. In the Lusitanian Basin, the earliest record of brachyuran\nbody fossils thus far occurs much later in the Late Jurassic (mid-\nOxfordian; Mateus et al., 2013).\n\nReports of fossil brachyurans preserved in situ with their trace\nfossils are limited to the longusorbiid Longusorbis cuniculosus\n(Richards, 1975) from the upper Campanian to lower Maastrichtian\nof British Columbia, Canada (Richards, 1975); Icriocarcinus xestos\n\n\n\n44 C.

The\nscarcity of fossil crabs is well-known, when compared to heavier\ncalcified taxa. They are frequently overlooked and, mostly because\nthey are rarely preserved in coastal and nearshore facies and are far\nless abundant in pre-Late Jurassic sequences (Stempien, 2005;\nKlompmaker et al., 2013). By the Bathonian times, amphibious\ncrab-like animals may have been producing burrows in gregarious\npopulations within supralittoral breccias-conglomerate and littoral\nin a closed and shallow, low-salinity to freshwater coastal-lagoon\nsetting, attributed to the Psilonichnus Ichnofacies (Marshall, 2003).\nThese trace fossils found in NW Scotland could potentially provide\nthe earliest known record of crab activity and their physiological\nadaptation to survive in a semi-terrestrial environment. The\nexplosive adaptive radiation of the short-tailed crab-like type took\nplace in the Late Jurassic (F\u00f6rster, 1985). Rapid diversification of\nmostly reef-swelling crabs during the Late Jurassic coincided with a\nmajor expansion of reefs (Klompmaker et al., 2013). The remarkable\nfindings described for Cabe\u00e7o da Ladeira, Portugal, of crab trackways\nproduced on an emerged tidal flat may push the evolution of true crabs\nwith amphibious adaptations into the Middle Jurassic (late Bajocian).\n\n4. Among the longest invertebrate trackways and trails\n\nAt Cabe\u00e7o da Ladeira there are several meter-long trackways\nattributed to crabs, trails that may be attributed to fishes (see below)\nand simple and straight furrows that may be compared with\ngastropod trails common to tidal flats. These latter trails consist of\na central, flat furrow bordered by two narrow parallel ridges and\nalmost vertical boundaries (Baucon, 2008; Fig. 6A). Two of the\ntrails end in an elliptical-shaped pit (Fig. 6B). These burrows are\n\noriented towards the coastline and may be interpreted as if the\nproducer looked for protection from dehydration or the phreatic\nlevel to keep the gills moist. The trail depth and sharpness may\nsuggest that the animal was grazing the microbial mat during\nemersion episodes, cutting through the rippled surface by bulldozing\nthe sediments in straight lines perpendicular to the estimated\ncoastline (Fig. 6C). Gastropods are relatively slow crawlers (e.g.,\nVermeij, 1987, and  references herein). Following the shortest distance\nto water would significantly reduce the time exposed to the elements\nand predators. However, there are also more sinuous long trails\nshowing the same bulldozing behavior (Fig. 6D). In fact, most of\nArchaeonassa occur as shallow epichnia, most of them covered with\na thin veneer of white clay, and they are among the most common\ntrace fossils in Cabe\u00e7o da Ladeira stratigraphic sequence (Fig. 6F).\nSeveral long trails perpendicularly cut the ripples, paralleling others\nand seem to burrow under the stiff microbial mat leaving partially\nexposed tunnels behind (Fig. 6E). According to M\u00e1ngano and Buatois\n(2015), Archaeonassa fossulata (Fenton and Fenton, 1937) may\nrepresent matground grazing of a microbially enriched surface. On\nthe other hand, mat growth may progressively cover any trail or\ntrackway crossing the flat. \n\nMeasuring 12.3 m Laterigradus lusitanica igen. nov., isp. nov.\nattributed to a crab trackway may be the longest described for\ninvertebrates in the fossil record. Also the gastropod trails, straight or\nsinuous, are extremely long and continuous and can be followed by\nup to 11.5 m (Figs. 4A, 6A). Other examples of extensive invertebrate\ntrackways in the literature are surprisingly rare. Lomax and Racay\n(2012) described a 9.7 m mortichnial trackway produced by\nMesolimulus walchi in the lower Tithonian of the Solnhofen\nLithographic Limestone. The longest fossil invertebrate trackway was\nclaimed by De (2014), for a 10 m long crab trackway from the Eocene\nMithakhari Group of Andaman island, and he provided a review of\nthe longest invertebrate repichnia in the literature. However, some\nexamples of very long trails and trackways may have not been taken\ninto consideration in the review of De (2014), such as the very long\ntrails attributed to Climactichnites wilsoni Logan, 1860, from the\nMiddle-to-Late Cambrian of Blackberry Hill, Wisconsin, studied in\ndetail for the last 20 years (Gass, 2015). Thus we may claim the\ncontinuous trackways and trails found at the Middle Jurassic of\nCabe\u00e7o da Ladeira are among the longest described in the fossil\nrecord. Apart from the relative interest that size may have for\nichnology, continuous long trackways provide comprehensive\ninformation about behavioral variations from the general pattern\nrelated to ecospace heterogeneity (hydrodynamics, water depth and\naerial exposure, substrate firmness, food distribution, etc.). \n\n5. The first trail of a stalked crinoid in the fossil record\n\nIn the tidal flat of Cabe\u00e7o da Ladeira, a stalked form of crinoid was\nfound at the end of its trail (Fig. 7). Its course can be followed from\na microbial mat patch identified by wrinkle structures. There, it\nshows the disruption of the mat around a shallow pit surrounded by\nsmall piles of broken sediment. The trail is very faint and large at\nthe beginning, becoming sharper and as wide as the crinoid later on\n(Fig. 7A; Fig. 8 for photogrammetric interpretation). It consists of\na flat to slightly disturbed central area resulting probably from stalk\ndragging. This central area is surrounded by two large and irregular\nfurrows limited externally by ridges of sediment. The two large\nfurrows were produced by the articulated moving arms of the\ncrinoid in loose sediment. All the arms and cirri are bending\nbackwards in locomotion position. \n\nThe columnal ossicles have more of less the same thickness\nthroughout the length of the stalk. The cirri are present throughout\nthe stalk, more or less regularly spaced, long, slender and ending on\na little hook. Little is known about the calyx, appearing to be short\n\nFig. 5. 3D Model of Laterigradus lusitanicus. The trackway is clearly perpendicular\nto the ripple marks; only a section is represented to show the transition from aerial\nsideways running, with three to four long-shaped imprints, to an underwater punting\ngait where just two limbs are used, leaving circular pits behind.

The preservation of the pinnules is poor,\nappearing to be relatively short. The presence of a stalk and the\narrangement of the cirri along it suggest that these specimens belong\nto the order Isocrinida. This isocrinid trail is the only one of its kind\nfound at Cabe\u00e7o da Ladeira.\n\nIsocrinid crinoids have a sessile life. Active crawling by stalked\ncrinoids, a group generally thought to be sessile, was only recently\n\ndemonstrated (Baumiller and Messing, 2007). This study reveals\nthat isocrinids could relocate by crawling with their arms, dragging\nthe stalk behind them. However, the locomotion behavior of\ncrinoids was never described from the fossil record. Speed is related\nto the length of the arms involved in the power stroke (Baumiller\nand Messing, 2007). The ability to detach the stalk and crawl may\nhave evolved as escape strategy from benthic predators. Cidaroid\nechinoids occur in the same bed where the isocrinid crinoid trail\n\nFig. 6.

The observed trace and maker suggest that this strategy\nmight have been used by shallow-water crinoids to cope with\nsudden environmental changes, or instances of an abnormal low\ntide, which may have been the reason for the trail made by the\ncrinoid at Cabe\u00e7o da Ladeira. Several features that are necessary\nfor crawling have been identified (Messing et al., 1988; Baumiller\nand Messing, 2007): a detachable stalk; some mode of reattachment\nof the stalk to the substrate, such as flexible cirri; and arms that are\nboth flexible and strong enough to generate the power and recovery\nstrokes to pull the animal along the bottom.\n\nThe elbow-crawling behavior may be described as the stalk\nbeing dragged behind the crown along the substrate, with the\nproximal part nearly horizontal. In this posture, only a portion of\nthe strongly aborally flexed arms are in contact with the substrate\n(Baumiller and Messing, 2007), as we can see in the Middle Jurassic\ntrail (Fig. 7B). In the power stroke, the arm base bends away from\nthe mouth, pushing the more strongly flexed arm tip down and\nbackward against the substrate. With the tide retreating and the flat\nbeing exposed, the crinoid had more difficulty in keeping the stalk\nuplifted and dragged it on the bottom. The result is expressed as the\nsharpening of the crawling effort, also due to dehydration of the\nsediment, and the piles of sediment pushed away by the arms\u2019\nmovement (Fig. 8). The trail becomes also more winding near the\ncrinoids' final resting place. This is a fine example of a mortichnion:\nthe isocrinid crinoid was caught by low tide in its death march\n(Seilacher, 2008). Examples of mortichnia are rare and some have\n\nbeen questioned recently (Vallon et al., 2015, 2016), but this find\nunequivocally confirms the validity of this ethological category.   \n\n6. Systematic ichnology\n\nIchnogenus Laterigradus igen. nov.\n\nDiagnosis: Asymmetric trackway formed by up to four tracks\ndistributed in discrete sets that may show different stride lengths\nadapted to distinct cursorial gaits expressed in water or land.\n\nLaterigradus lusitanica isp. nov.\n(Figs. 4, 5)\n\nEtymology: Laterigradus comes from Latin and refers to the\nsideways steps; lusitanica indicates the territory of the Lusitani tribe\nthat lived in Central Portugal before the expansion of the Roman\nEmpire to Iberia; it gave also the name to the Lusitanian Basin.\n\nType locality and age: Cabe\u00e7o da Ladeira, included in the Vale da\nSerra Member of the Ch\u00e3o de Pias Formation, upper Bajocian (Sauzei\nbiozone; Ruget-Perrot, 1961); Maci\u00e7o Calc\u00e1rio Estremenho (Lusitanian\nBasin, Portugal) coordinates: 8\u00b047\u201957.307\u201dW, 39\u00b032\u201939.108\u201dN.\n\nMaterial: Numerous examples of such trackways in beds 4 to 6\nof Cabe\u00e7o da Ladeira site. The holotype is the longest and the best\npreserved trackway. A cast of the total length of this trackway was\nmade and stored at the Geological Museum of Lisbon, number\nMG30474.\n\nDiagnosis: The same as for the ichnogenus. Uniserial trackways\nwith sets of up to four circular-to-sigmoidal tracks.\n\nRemarks: This is a repichnion of crab-form decapods, most\nprobably an brachyuran revealing a sideward locomotion. The\ntrackways are straight to gently curved trackways and may reveal\ndifferent stride lengths and number of tracks according to an\nunderwater punting or octopedal walking gaits on land. The deepest\npart of dactyl imprints is located in the opposite direction to the\nlocomotion, thus providing the direction of movement. The\nconcentration of footprints in the trackway shows changes in speed\nof probing the sediment. The relatively low density of trackways\nshows that the crab producers were not gregarious, but territorial\nwith large feeding areas in the flat.\n\nRemarkably, there are few trackway ichnotaxa attributed to\ncrustaceans. Pirrie et al. (2004) described the ichnogenus\nFoesterichnus rossensis, from the Coniacian Hidden Lake Formation,\nat James Ross Island, Antarctica, and revised the trackway fossil\nrecord of crustaceans. The diagnosis of the ichnogenus includes\nstraight or curving trackways composed of paired rows of elongate\nto tear-shaped impressions, organized in series of three and four\nimprints. They clearly evidence forward walking of brachyuran crabs,\nand they were the first formally described and attributed to this group\nfrom the fossil record (Pirrie et al., 2004). As Laterigradus lusitanicus\nevidences a different locomotory, sideways walking and running\nbehavior, that also has morphological implications for the crab-form\nproducer responsible for them, we think it is useful to erect a new\nichnogenus to include asymmetric trackways of brachyuran crabs.\n\nIchnogenus Krinodromos igen. nov.\n\nDiagnosis: Trails composed of a narrow and flat central area with\nan irregular winding furrow, or almost no sedimentary disruption,\nbordered by shallow and large grooves externally limited by\nirregular piles of sediment.\n\nKrinodromos bentou isp. nov.\n(Figs. 7, 8)\n\nEtymology: Krinodromos comes from the Greek \u201cthe course of the\n[sea] lily\u201d; bentou refers to the closest village, S. Bento, close to which\nis located the quarry where the crinoid crawling trace was found.\n\nFig. 7.

Neto de Carvalho et al. / Comunica\u00e7\u00f5es Geol\u00f3gicas (2016) 103, Especial I, 39-54\n\nType locality and age: Cabe\u00e7o da Ladeira, included in the Vale\nda Serra Member of the Ch\u00e3o de Pias Formation, upper Bajocian\n(Sauzei biozone; Ruget-Perrot, 1961); Maci\u00e7o Calc\u00e1rio Estremenho\n(Lusitanian Basin, Portugal): coordinates: 8\u00b047\u201957,307\u201dW,\n39\u00b032\u201939,108\u201dN.\n\nMaterial: The holotype and only example was found with an\nisocrinid crinoid at its very end, which makes the attribution of the\ntrail to a tracemaker much easier. A cast was made and stored at the\nGeological Museum of Lisbon, number MG30475.\n\nDiagnosis: The same as for the ichnogenus.\nDescription: Very faint irregular trail with planar central area,\n\nor disrupted by an irregular curving furrow and bordered by two\nshallow, wide and irregular grooves that are limited by piles of\nsediment. The trail is mostly straight but narrows and curves\nabruptly (c. 50\u00ba) where the crinoid body fossil rests, becoming\nimpressed more sharply (Fig. 8). \n\nRemarks: Being a shallow and irregular trail, it is not easy to\ncompare Krinodromos bentou to other examples from the fossil\nrecord if found without the associated producer. This trail is\nprobably rare because we interpret this as an unusual locomotion\non land resulting from flat exposure that ultimately caused the death\nof the crinoid. The most conspicuous ichnotaxobases that\ncharacterizes Krinodromos bentou are the two bordering grooves\ncombined with pushed sediment piles, and a central flat area or a\nnarrow winding furrow, depending on the firmness of the substrate.\nThis trail can be explained as mortichnion of an isocrinid. In an\nabnormally low tide the crinoid crawled away from the microbial\nmat where it was anchored in a vertical hole surrounded by sediment\npustules resulting from the effort to become free. The crinoid used\nsets of arms to create a bilateral symmetric locomotion by flexing\nthe arms backwards pushing the sediment laterally, causing irregular\npiles. The bending termination of the trail could represent the climax\nof a stressed condition that coincided with the aerial exposure of the\nflat and the death of the crinoid. The animal was simply not fast\nenough to reach the water line. The width of the trace is similar to\nthe width of the crinoids\u2019 bending arms in the final part, suggesting\nthat it was produced as the body was dragged by the appendages\nthroughout the sediment (Fig. 8). \n\nArchaeonassa fossulata Fenton and Fenton, 1937\n(Fig. 6)\n\nDescription: Unilobed narrow trails, having a median groove\nflanked by ridges, less than 10 mm to up to 40 mm wide.

Another long trail, measuring 8.4\nm long and 20 mm wide, possesses an elliptical-shaped hole at one\nof the ends.\n\nRemarks: These traces match the morphology of A. fossulata\nreviewed by Buckman (1994) and Yochelson and Fedonkin (1997).\nIt is generally understood as recording the grazing behavior of\ngastropods. Archaeonassa may also be produced by preying\ngastropods (Baucon and Felletti, 2013a, 2013b).\n\nDiplopodichnus isp.\n(Fig. 9A)\n\nDescription: Two parallel grooves 1-3 mm wide, each in a straight,\nbut mostly winding course, formed by discrete footprints or\noverlapping ones developing linear furrows. Prints are circular or\nelongated perpendicular to the trail course. \n\nRemarks: These kinds of trails were described by Baucon\n(2008) as produced by the pereiopod prints and the dragging tail of\nmud shrimps. These axiidean shrimps are active during the low tide,\ngrazing the algae and bacteria that develop at the sediment surface\n\n(see Baucon, 2008, and references therein). Diplopodichnus are\nusually filled with sediment and cut by gastropod grazing trails,\nwhich indicates that these trackways were produced underwater.\nAxiideans, notably Axiidae, have a fossil record into the Early\nJurassic (e.g., Hy\u017en\u00fd and Klompmaker, 2015).\n\nGyrochorte comosa Heer, 1865\n(Fig. 9B)\n\nDescription: Winding bilobed burrows in convex epirelief, 4-18 mm\nwide, preserved as plaited ridges with bisserially arranged, chevron-\nshaped pads of sediment, separated by a median furrow.\n\nRemarks: This is a burrow typical for the Cruziana Ichnofacies,\nproduced within the sediments in a subtidal environment. The\nproducer may be a polychaete-like worm (e.g., Heinberg, 1973).\nHowever, the method of sediment transport and locomotion\nrepresented in Gyrochorte fit the physiology of an arthropod much\nbetter (see Schlirf, 2000). \n\nHaplotichnus indianensis Miller, 1889\n(Fig. 9C)\n\nDescription: Simple half-cylindrical trail, unbranched and\nhorizontal, needle-like in size, running in straight or crooked lines,\nor crossing itself (Rindsberg and Kopaska-Merkel, 2005). \n\nRemarks: Haplotichnus is interpreted to be the work of insects\n(Rindsberg and Kopaska-Merkel, 2005). The sharp turns are\nsignificant because short-bodied animals such as arthropods can\nchange direction more easily than long-bodied worms. Due to its\ngeotechnical properties, the mat is a protective environment for\ndelicate juvenile insect forms. According to the observations of\nBaucon (2008), larvae of Diptera behave as undermat miners by\nexcavating very shallow burrows parallel to the mat surface. The\nupper organic-rich layer would provide abundant nutrients and, at\nthe same time, it guaranteed protection from predators and physical\ndisturbance (Baucon, 2008), while the burrow was produced in the\nmineral-rich layer with microbial mat related structures. \n\nAsterosoma ludwigae Schlirf, 2000\n(Fig. 9D)\n\nDescription: Asterosoma with linear or curved elipsoidal bulbs,\nthose seem to develop from an axial horizontal burrow. Bulbs are\nloosely grouped following the axial burrow that is in a lower level\nso bulbs are oblique and rise from the bedding plane. Burrow\nsurface contains scratch marks and burrow fill is similar to the host\nbed. \n\nRemarks: Asterosoma occurs in the same bed of Thalassinoides\nsuevicus, with convex epirelief preservation. These burrows form\nthe deepest tier in the ichnofabric, and were developed in subtidal\nconditions. They may share the same producer, in accordance with\nNeto de Carvalho and Rodrigues (2007).\n\nThalassinoides suevicus Rieth, 1932\n(Fig. 9E)\n\nDescription: Burrow meshworks with unlined burrow walls, smooth\nlining, branching predominantly dichotomous, Y- to T- shaped\ntypically enlarged at points of bifurcation. Sizes of T. suevicus differ\nbetween 7 and 40 mm in diameter.\n\nRemarks: These burrows represent three-dimensional boxworks.\nBed 4 is extensively bioturbated by small examples of Thalassinoides.\nCommon intergradations between Thalassinoides suevicus and\nSpongeliomorpha Saporta, 1887, have been repeatedly described in\nthe literature (see references in Schlirf, 2000). Outer burrow scratch\nmarks are the result of digging in a firm substrate. The proposed\nproducers of both size-scaled Thalassinoides could be small Axiidea\n\n\n\nTrackways from the Mid Jurassic of Cabe\u00e7o da Ladeira 49\n\nFig. 8.

The ichnogenus\nRhizocorallium was recently revised by Knaust (2013), who\nresumed to two valid ichnospecies, R. jenense and R. commune. The\nproducer in this case is unknown, as Rhizocorallium-behavior may\nbe produced by different worm and arthropod organisms. For\nKnaust (2013), the most likely producers for marine Rhizocorallium\nare polychaetes, based on their long-ranging occurrence,\nmorphological features, associated body-fossil remains, and modern\nanalogues. However Meyer (1988) cited the axiid Protaxius within\nRhizocorallium. The common observation of scratch marks in the\nwalls of R. commune in firmgrounds from different age across the\nLusitanian Basin led Neto de Carvalho et al. (2010) and Mateus et\nal. (2013) to attribute this ichnospecies to the feeding behavior of\ncrustaceans.\n\n?Undichna isp.\n(Fig. 9G,H)\n\nDescription: Trackways made of continuous, four or more, parallel\nfurrows, 1-3+ m long in sets 70-100 mm wide. Grooves are mostly\nlinear or curvilinear, or slightly sinusoidal. One of them is at least\n3.2 m long and ends with a very shallow, resting trace with a\ncrescent shape similar to the recently described Crescentichnus by\nRomano and White (2015) (Fig. 9H).\n\nRemarks: Undichna is interpreted to be a fish-fin or fish-swimming\ntrail left as an impression on the substrate (Trewin, 2000). They may\nhave been produced during the low tide, when the water was retreating\nfrom the flat. Sets of grooves are usually sinusoidal with different\nwavelengths. In Cabe\u00e7o da Ladeira, the furrows are mostly linear and\ncan be traced for long distances, which is why we only attempt to\ncompare those trails to Undichna. These traces are most common in\nbed 2; in bed 3 they are cut across by a crab trackway, suggesting that\nUndichna was made first. (Fig. 9G). In bed 2, two of them intersect\neach other, making a meander at the point of intersection.\n\n7. Conclusions\n\nTrace fossils are useful to decipher paleoenvironmental conditions\nand advance the knowledge about the evolutionary causes of\nbehavior. The upper Bajocian limestone sequence from Cabe\u00e7o da\nLadeira, in the central part of Lusitanian Basin in Portugal, is\ncomposed of a repetition of environmental conditions prone to the\ndevelopment of microbial mats and oncolites in the carbonate tidal\nflat, that may have expanded substantially at low tide during the\nequinoctial spring tide. The result was the practically in situ killing\nof echinoderm specimens and their fine preservation together with\ndelicate trackways and burrow details of a community dominated\nby cursorial arthropods and gastropods. A moderately diverse,\nshallow-tiered ichnoassemblage composed of ten ichnotaxa were\ndescribed, among them the new ichnogenera and ichnospecies\nLaterigradus lusitanica and Krinodromos bentou. The first represent\ndifferent gaits attributed to sideward walking and running of a crab-\nform animal. Underwater punting and aerial locomotion gaits were\ndescribed and exemplify the dawn of true crabs and the first attempts\n\nof amphibious crabs in conquering terrestrial habitats. Together with\nstraight bulldozing trails attributed to the grazing behavior of\ngastropods, Cabe\u00e7o da Ladeira includes some of the longest\ninvertebrate cursorial traces in the fossil record. Krinodromos\nbentou corresponds to the death march of an isocrinid crinoid in its\nattempt to crawl to the shore. The elbow-crawl behavior is the first\nrecord of stemmed crinoid locomotion from the fossil record.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe greatly appreciate the support of all who have allowed the\ndevelopment of studies and interpretation of this geosite, not\nforgetting to mention the important commitment of the local\ncommunity in the conservation and valuation of this paleontological\nheritage.
