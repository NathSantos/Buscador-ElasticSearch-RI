Response surface methodology was used for optimization \nof the pH and concentration of the buffer, applied voltage and temperature. The method employed \n50 mmol L-1 borate buffer at pH 10 as background electrolyte with an applied voltage of 15 kV. \nThe separation was carried out in a fused-silica capillary maintained at 32.5 oC and the detection \nwavelength was 214 nm. The method was validated showing specificity, linearity (r = 0.9995), \nprecision (relative standard deviation less than 2%) and accuracy (99.95%). The method proved to \nbe robust by a fractional factorial design evaluation. The proposed CZE method was successfully \napplied for the quantitative analysis of lodenafil carbonate in tablets and the results compared to \nthe high performance liquid chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometric methods, showed \nnon-significant differences.\n\nKeywords: capillary zone electrophoresis, experimental design, lodenafil carbonate, \noptimization, validation\n\nIntroduction \n\nCapillary electrophoresis (CE) has become one \nof the most advanced separation techniques for \npharmaceutical analysis, although quality control analysis \nof pharmaceuticals currently is performed predominantly \nwith high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).1,2 \nIt has been proven that CE is a useful and reliable \nalternative and a complementary technique to HPLC in \nmany areas, including the determination of the active \npharmaceutical ingredients, drug related impurities, \nenantiomeric separations, identity confirmation and \n\nstoichiometry determination.3-6 CE has many advantages \nsuch as high efficiency, high resolution, rapid analysis and \nlow consumption of sample and reagents.7,8\n\nThe optimization of separation with CE is complex \nand difficult, because a high number of parameters, such \nas temperature, pH, voltage and buffer composition affect \nthe separation. Rather than following the conventional \nmonovariate approach used to adjust the parameters, thus \ninvolving a large number of independent analyses, one \ncould advantageously replace the procedure by statistically \ndesigned experimental protocols, in which several factors \nare simultaneously varied. The use of an experimental \ndesign can be extremely beneficial in developing capillary \nelectrophoretic methods.9\n\n\n\nCodevilla et al. 2115Vol. 23, No. 11, 2012\n\nResponse surface methodology is a collection of \nstatistical and mathematical techniques useful for \ndeveloping, improving and optimizing processes, \ninterpreting the relationships between the responses and \nfactor effects and simultaneously optimizing the levels of \nvariables to achieve the best system performance.10,11\n\nErectile dysfunction (ED) is defined by the National \nInstitutes of Health as the inability to achieve and maintain \nan erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual intercourse.12 \nED is not a life-threatening disorder, but it influences the \npatient\u2019s daily routine, social interactions, well-being and \nquality of life.13 It may often be the first manifestation of \nimportant systemic (in advancing age) or relational (in \nyounger age) pathologies and it is considered a possible \nmarker of clinically undiagnosed disease, thus representing \nthe \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019 of a systemic vascular disorder.14,15 \n\nIn 1998, a new class of drugs, the phosphodiesterase \ntype 5 inhibitors (PDE5 inhibitors) was introduced. The \nPDE5 inhibitors have revolutionized the way in which \nmen with ED can be treated.16,17 The advent of these highly \nefficacious and relatively safe compounds had a profound \nimpact on the diagnosis and treatment of ED.18\n\nLodenafil (bis-(2-{4-[4-ethoxy-3-(1-methyl-7-oxo-3-\npropyl-6,7-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo [4,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)-\nbenzenesulfonyl]piperazin-1-yl}-ethyl) carbonate (Figure 1)  \nis a PDE5 inhibitor developed in Brazil, which is a dimer \nformed by two lodenafil molecules linked by a carbonate \nbridge. Lodenafil carbonate (LOC) is a product that after \ningestion delivers the active compound lodenafil.19,20\n\nLittle has been published until now concerning the \ndetection of LOC in pharmaceutical preparations21,22 \nand biological samples.19 These studies involve UV \nspectrophotometric and HPLC method for the determination \nof LOC.\n\nThis work proposes the development, optimization \nand validation of a capillary zone electrophoresis \n\n(CZE) method for the determination of LOC in tablets, \nestablishing a comparison with the validated HPLC and \nUV spectrophotometric methods. \n\nExperimental \n\nChemicals and reagents\n\nLOC (lodenafil carbonate) used as reference substance \nwas kin dly supplied by Crist\u00e1lia Produtos Qu\u00edmicos \nFarmac\u00eauticos LTDA (S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil) and nimesulide \nreference standard, used as internal standard (IS), was \npurchased from United States Pharmacopeia (USP, \nRockville, USA). The tablets of Helleva\u00ae (Crist\u00e1lia \nProdutos Qu\u00edmicos Farmac\u00eauticos LTDA, S\u00e3o Paulo, \nBrazil) containing LOC (80 mg per tablet, excipients: \ncalcium phosphate dibasic dihydrate, povidone, lactose, \ncolloidal silicon dioxide, sodium croscarmellose, \nmicrocrystalline cellulose and magnesium stearate) \nwere obtained commercially. All chemicals used were of \npharmaceutical or special analytical grade. Throughout \nthe study, water was obtained from a Milli-Q system from \nMillipore (Bedford, USA). Before analysis, all the solutions \nwere filtered through 0.22 mm Millex filter (Millipore).\n\nApparatus and electrophoretic conditions\n\nCZE (capillary zone electrophoresis) experiments \nwere performed on an Agilent 3DCE apparatus (Agilent \nTechnologies, Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with an \nautosampler, a photodiode array (PDA) detector, and \npower supply able to deliver up to 30 kV. CE ChemStation \nsoftware was used for instrument control, data acquisition \nand analysis. \n\nElectrophoretic separations were carried out with a \nfused-silica capillary with 50 ?m i.d. and 48.5 cm of total \nlength (effective length 40 cm), thermostatized at 32.5 oC, \nand with detection set at 214 nm using a PDA detector. \nHydrodynamic injection of sample was performed at \n50 mbar for 5 s and a constant voltage of 15 kV was applied \nduring the analysis. At the beginning of each working \nday, the capillary was rinsed sequentially with 0.1 mol L-1 \nsodium hydroxide for 15 min, followed by water for 15 min, \nand then with running electrolyte solution for 15 min. \nTo achieve high migration time reproducibility between \ninjections, the capillary was conditioned with 0.1 mol L-1 \nsodium hydroxide (2 min), water (1 min), and a running \nBGE solution (2 min). Because electrolysis can change the \nelectroosmotic flow (EOF) and affect the migration time, \nefficiency, and selectivity, the running electrolyte solution \nwas replaced by a fresh solution after every three injections.\n\nFigure 1. Chemical structure of lodenafil carbonate.\n\n\n\nLodenafil Carbonate Tablets: Optimization and Validation of a Capillary Zone Electrophoresis Method J. Braz. Chem. Soc.2116\n\nBackground electrolyte solution preparation \n\nThe optimized background electrolyte (BGE) solution \nused in this analysis was 50 mmol L-1 boric acid at pH 10. \nTo prepare this solution 0.154 g of boric acid was diluted \nwith 40 mL of water. The pH was adjusted to 10 by adding \n0.1 mol L-1 sodium hydroxide and the volume completed \nto 50 mL with ultrapure water. The solution was daily \nprepared and filtered.\n\nPreparation of reference substance solutions\n\nStandard stock solution of LOC was prepared by \naccurately weighing 10 mg of LOC transferred to a 100 mL \nvolumetric flask with 0.1 mol L-1 sodium hydroxide \n(100 ?g mL-1). A standard stock solution of nimesulide \n(1 mg mL-1) was prepared in methanol. All solutions were \nstored at 2-8 oC, protected from light and diluted daily to \nan appropriate concentration with background electrolyte \nsolution. \n\nSample preparation\n\nTwenty tablets of Helleva\u00ae were finely powdered. A \nweighed portion of the powder, equivalent to 10 mg of \nLOC was transferred to a 100 mL volumetric flask. With \nthe addition of 50 mL of sodium hydroxide, the mixture \nwas sonicated for 10 min, and filtered. The sample \nstock solution prepared with the final concentration of \n100 ?g mL-1 of LOC was stored at 2-8 oC, protected from \nlight and diluted daily to an appropriate concentration \nwith BGE. \n\nStatistical software and design of experiment for method \noptimization\n\nAll the experimental designs, graphical and statistical \nanalysis of the data were performed by Minitab 14 (Minitab \nInc, State College, PA, USA) data analysis software system.\n\nFactorial designs are the most useful schemes for \nthe optimization of variables with a limited number of \nexperiments. A variety of factorial designs are available \nto accomplish this task. The most successful and best \namong them is the central composite design, which is \naccomplished by adding two experimental points along \neach coordinate axis at opposite sides of the origin and at a \ndistance equal to the semi-diagonal of the hyper cube of the \nfactorial design and new extreme values (?; low and high) \nfor each factor added in this design. This first experimental \ndesign was carried out to optimize the electrophoretic \nconditions with high sensitivity, efficiency and short run \n\ntime. A second order polynomial was used to fit the data. \nTreatment allocation with their respective experimental \nvalues is shown in Table 1.\n\nValidation\n\nTo demonstrate the suitability of this method for \npharmaceutical quality control, it was validated with \nrespect to specificity, linearity, precision, accuracy, and \nrobustness, according to the International Conference on \nHarmonisation (ICH) recommendations, at the optimized \noperating conditions.23\n\nSpecificity\nThe specificity of the method was investigated by \n\nanalyzing a placebo solution containing all the tablet \ncomponents except LOC. In addition, the specificity was \nassessed by observing potential interferences between \nLOC and degradation products obtained, when standard \nsolutions of LOC were stressed by acidic, basic, oxidative \nand UV light conditions. Solutions of LOC in 1.0 mol L-1 \nhydrochloric acid and 1.0 mol L-1 sodium hydroxide \nwere exposed at 60 \u00baC for 5 h. Oxidative degradation \nwas induced by storing the solutions in 0.1% potassium \npermanganate at room temperature for 15 min, protected \nfrom light. Photolytic studies were done by exposing \nthe sample solution to a 254 nm UV lamp for 15 min, \nin a photostability chamber. The samples were analyzed \nagainst a freshly prepared control sample (with no \ndegradation treatment). \n\nLinearity \nLinearity was tested on three different days at 7 \n\nconcentration levels of LOC (20-80 mg mL-1) and spiked \nwith a constant concentration of nimesulide (50 ?g mL-1) \nused as internal standard. Each concentration level was \ninjected in triplicate. The peak area ratio of LOC reference \nsubstance to the IS, against the respective reference \nconcentrations, was used for plotting the graph, and the \nlinearity was evaluated by the least square regression \nanalysis.\n\nTable 1.

For \nrepeatability studies, six replicate experiments were \ncarried out on the same day. The intermediate precision \nwas performed by comparing the results of the assay on \n3 different days.\n\nAccuracy\nThe accuracy of the developed method was evaluated \n\nby a recovery test. The sample solutions were fortified \nwith three known concentrations of reference standard \ncorresponding to 75, 100 and 125% of the sample \nconcentration (50 mg mL-1).\n\nRobustness\nIn order to study the simultaneous variation of \n\nthe factors in the considered responses, a multivariate \napproach using design of experiments is recommended in \nrobustness testing. The procedure selected was a 2-level 24-1 \nfractional factorial design performed by the selection of \nfour factors, studied at two levels (high and low): borate \nbuffer concentration (48; 52 mmol L-1), pH borate buffer \n(9.8; 10.2), capillary temperature (31; 34 \u00baC), and voltage \n(13; 17 kV). The ranges examined were small deviations \nfrom the method settings. A center point with the optimized \nconditions was also added to the factorial design (nine \nexperiments). The response is the percentage of LOC in \nthe tablets (relative to their label claimed concentration) \nobtained by the comparison with the reference solution \nin each experiment. All experiments were performed in \nrandomized order to minimize the effects of uncontrolled \nfactors that may introduce a bias into the response. The \nstatistical analyses of the data were performed by the \nMINITAB 14 (Minitab Inc, State College, PA, USA) data \nanalysis software.\n\nResults and Discussion \n\nThe optimization of a CZE separation condition is a \ncritical step, since the wide array of variables, such as applied \nvoltage, buffer composition and temperature, can influence \nthe separation efficiency, migration time and resolution.24 \nCentral composite designs are by far the most widely used \nmethods for the optimization of CZE separations since they \noffer the possibility of evaluating the curvature of the data \nand fitting the experimental points to response surfaces.25 \n\nThe CZE method parameters for determination of the \nLOC were optimized to obtain the best efficiency, symmetry \nand resolution within the minimum analysis time. The \n\noptimization procedure was comprised of two steps: initial \nexperiments and experimental design.\n\nThe aim of the initial experiments was to establish \nthe basic analytical requirements (pH range, type of \nbuffer) of the method. Some buffer systems containing \nsodium phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium acetate, \nsodium tetraborate, ammonium acetate or boric acid \nwere investigated in the pH range from 5-10 at different \nconcentrations (10-50 mmol L-1). The use of borate buffer \nat a concentration of 50 mmol L-1 with pH value around \n10 (at a temperature of 32.5 \u00baC, 12.5 kV) resulted in high \nsensitivity and good peak symmetry of LOC. \n\nAfter a small number of runs and the selection of basic \nelectrophoretic conditions, a central composite design was \napplied to optimize the main variables that could influence \nthe LOC analyses by CZE: pH borate buffer, borate \nbuffer concentration, capillary temperature and voltage. \nA response surface methodology was carried out to obtain \nmore information and to investigate the behavior of the \nresponse around the nominal values of the factors. Response \nsurface methodology has the following advantages: (i) to \nallow a complete study where all interaction effects are \nestimated, and (ii) to give an accurate description of an \nexperimental region around a center of interest with validity \nof interpolation.26,27 The criterion to select the optimum \nvalues for the studied variables was based on obtaining \na maximum for a multiple response function established, \nsince LOC were easily separated from degradation products \nshowing adequate efficiency (number of theoretical plates), \ntailing factor and short analysis time. Experiments were \nperformed according to the experimental plan determined \nby Minitab software. Significant changes in migration time \nand tailing factor were observed for all the combinations, \nimplying that these variables significantly affected the \nelectrophoretic pattern.\n\nFrom the optimization procedure, pH, buffer \nconcentration and separation voltage were found significant \non efficiency with optimum values of 50 mmol L-1 borate \nbuffer at pH 10 with an applied voltage of 15 kV and \ncapillary temperature of 32.5 \u00baC. Under these conditions, \nefficiencies higher than 80000, good symmetry (around \n1.0) and lower migration time (approximately 4 min) were \nachieved. Some of the estimated response surfaces from \nwhich the above mentioned optimum values have been \nobtained are shown in Figure 2.\n\nMethod validation\n\nSpecificity\nThe specificity of the method indicates the ability to \n\naccurately measure the analyte response in the presence of \n\n\n\nLodenafil Carbonate Tablets: Optimization and Validation of a Capillary Zone Electrophoresis Method J. Braz. Chem. Soc.2118\n\npotentially interfering sample components or degradation \nproducts. The specificity was evaluated by stressing the \nanalyte under acidic, basic, oxidative and photolytic \nconditions. Chromatographic runs of a placebo solution \nwere also performed. Figure 3 shows that the acidic, basic \nand oxidative conditions resulted in a decreased area \nwithout any additional peak, indicating that the degradation \nproducts (DP) were not detected by UV or the degradation \nproducts did not migrate in the CZE method. The photolytic \ncondition exhibited a significant decrease of the area, and \ntwo additional peaks were detected at 5.8 and 6.3 min \n(Figure 3). In all cases the purity of LOC was assessed with \nthe PDA detector, demonstrating that the proposed method \nis specific for the analysis. The chromatographic run of a \nplacebo solution showed no interference of the excipients \nwith the elution of LOC.\n\nLinearity\nLinearity was investigated in the concentration range of \n\n20-80 mg mL-1 for LOC, and 50 mg mL-1 of nimesulide was \nadded as IS in all cases. The linearity curve was defined \nby the equation of y = 0.019x + 0.038, where y is the peak \narea ratio of LOC to IS, and x is the concentration of LOC \nexpressed in mg mL-1. The correlation coefficient was \n0.9995. The validity of the assay was verified by means \nof analysis of variance (ANOVA), which demonstrated \nsignificant linear regression (p &lt;0.05) and no significant \nlinearity deviation (p > 0.05). The limit of detection (LOD) \nwas based on the standard deviation of the response and the \nslope of the constructed calibration curve, as described in \nInternational Conference on Harmonization guidelines.23 \nThe LOD achieved was 1.36 mg mL-1.\n\nPrecision\nThe precision of the method for LOC determination was \n\nevaluated using the results obtained over 1 day of operation \nunder the same conditions (intra-assay) and for 3 days \n(inter-assay). The results expressed as the relative standard \ndeviation (RSD %) are given in Table 2, and indicate that \nthe method has repeatability and intermediate precision.\n\nAccuracy\nA LOC sample solution was fortified with three \n\nsolutions at known concentrations and at three different \nlevels. The recovery of added standard was determined \nin triplicate analysis and the results are shown in Table 3.\n\nRobustness\nThe susceptibility to change of the analytical method \n\ndeveloped was tested in order to evaluate the robustness. \nFor this purpose a 2-level 24-1 fractional factorial design was \nemployed. The experimental plan and the corresponding \nresponses are summarized in Table 4.\n\nThe significance of the effects was evaluated by a Pareto \nchart of the standardized effects and normal probability \nplot of the residuals. The Pareto graph (Figure 4a) consists \nof bars with a length proportional to the absolute value of \nthe estimated effect, divided by the pseudo standard error \ndefined by Lenth (Lenth\u2019s PSE).28 Codes A, B, C, and D \ncorrespond to the borate buffer concentration, pH borate \nbuffer, capillary temperature and voltage, respectively. The \ncombination of two codes indicates the interaction effect \nbetween the two variables. The bars were displayed based \non the size of the effect, with the largest effect at the top. \nThe chart includes a vertical line at the critical t-value for \n\nFigure 2.

Effects in which the bars are smaller than the \ncritical t-value were not considered significant and did not \naffect the response variables. Figure 4b presents the normal \nprobability plot of residuals for LOC. At the studied ranges, \nthe effects of the factors were not statistically significant \n(? = 0.05) for the response studied, assay (%). Therefore, \nthere were no significant changes in the assay regarding \nthe percentage of LOC contents in the modifications made \nunder the experimental conditions showing the robustness \nof the developed method.\n\nComparison between the CZE method, UV?spectro?\nphotometric method and HPLC method\n\nT h e  r e s u l t s  o b t a i n e d  f r o m  t h e  C Z E  m e t h o d \nwere compared statistically with the HPLC and UV \nspectrophotometric method published previously,21,22 and \nno evidence of significant difference was observed. The \ncalculated F-value (Fcalculated = 1.73987) was found to \nbe less than the critical F-value (Fcritical = 3.35413) at \n5% of significance level. Thus, the proposed method is \nappropriate for the determination of LOC in tablets and \ncan be used in routine quality control.\n\nTable 2.

The method was \noptimized by using response surface methodology, which \nmade it possible to achieve good efficiency, high sensitivity \n\nand short analysis time. The method was validated \nfollowing ICH guidelines and showed sufficient linearity, \naccuracy, precision, specificity and robustness. Compared \nwith the validated HPLC and UV spectrophotometric \nmethods, the CZE method has some advantages including \nthe use of smaller amounts of sample and reagents and \nthe employment of an aqueous system rather than the \npotentially toxic organic solvents. Thus, this method is a \nsuitable alternative for routine quality control of LOC in \npharmaceutical formulations.\n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThe authors wish to thank the Crist\u00e1lia Laboratories \n(Brazil) for the supply of the reference substance and the \nCNPq for the financial support. \n\nReferences\n\n 1.
