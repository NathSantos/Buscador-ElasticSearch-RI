A eles \n\ndedico este trabalho! \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nii \n \n\n  \n\n\n\niii \n \n\nResumo \n\n \n\nAo longo do seu desenvolvimento, o ser humano sempre necessitou de recorrer a fontes de energia para \n\nsatisfazer as suas necessidades b\u00e1sicas, quer na forma de calor ou trabalho. As fontes de energia \n\nrenov\u00e1veis que tal como o nome indica, s\u00e3o fontes inesgot\u00e1veis e sem qualquer tipo de emiss\u00f5es \n\npoluentes para o ambiente, surgiram como uma alternativa \u00e0s fontes de energia de origem f\u00f3ssil \n\n(petr\u00f3leo, g\u00e1s natural e carv\u00e3o) e nuclear. Alguns exemplos destas fontes de energia renov\u00e1vel s\u00e3o: \n\nvento, sol, biomassa, ondas e mar\u00e9s, h\u00eddrica e geotermia.  \n\nA energia que potencialmente pode ser gerada pelo vento seria suficiente para suprir toda a procura \n\nenerg\u00e9tica no mundo (entre 81-118 PWh/ano). No entanto, este potencial nem sempre \u00e9 aproveitado \n\ndevido a certas restri\u00e7\u00f5es, como a localiza\u00e7\u00e3o do parque e\u00f3lico ou a limita\u00e7\u00e3o da altura das turbinas. As \n\ntecnologias para gera\u00e7\u00e3o de energia e\u00f3lica a altas altitudes, com cotas superiores a 100 metros, \n\npretendem minimizar parte desses problemas, uma vez que a estas alturas o vento sopra com maior \n\nvelocidade. A principal preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 entender se estas tecnologias tamb\u00e9m podem competir com as \n\nturbinas e\u00f3licas convencionais em termos de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de energia, com melhor rela\u00e7\u00e3o qualidade-custo. \n\nEste tipo de tecnologia tem o potencial de reduzir o custo de investimento, porque tem uma estrutura \n\nmenos complexa do que uma turbina convencional e aumenta a energia produzida, acedendo a lugares \n\nde maior potencial e\u00f3lico, o que resulta num menor custo unit\u00e1rio de energia. No entanto, \u00e9 preciso ter \n\nem conta que o pre\u00e7o por kilograma do material tipicamente utilizado nestas tecnologias, a fibra de \n\ncarbono, \u00e9 bastante superior ao pre\u00e7o do a\u00e7o utilizado na constru\u00e7\u00e3o das estruturas das turbinas e\u00f3licas.  \n\nNo prot\u00f3tipo criado pela Makani, alega-se um custo unit\u00e1rio de energia de 0.026 \u20ac/kWh, um valor \n\nconsideravelmente menor quando comparado com o de uma turbina convencional de 2.5 MW que ronda \n\nos 0.078 \u20ac/kWh. \n\nA principal objetivo desta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 avaliar o potencial energ\u00e9tico que \u00e9 poss\u00edvel atingir com o \n\nprot\u00f3tipo \u201cM600\u201d, desenhado pela Makani. Esta tecnologia tem como base um planador com 26 metros \n\nde envergadura com oito pequenos rotores dispostos ao longo das suas asas. Estes rotores ao serem \n\natravessados pelo vento, produzem energia sendo esta transmitida para uma esta\u00e7\u00e3o no solo atrav\u00e9s de \n\num cabo condutor el\u00e9trico com cerca de 400 metros. A fibra de carbono que constitui o corpo do \n\nplanador concede lhe uma alta resist\u00eancia \u00e0 tra\u00e7\u00e3o, e um baixo peso que favorece as suas manobras \n\ndurante o voo. O cabo condutor el\u00e9trico, revestido tamb\u00e9m por fibra de carbono, apresenta no seu \n\ninterior alum\u00ednio, um material com uma baixa imped\u00e2ncia el\u00e9trica, sendo por isso um bom condutor \n\nel\u00e9trico, garantindo que as perdas de energia na sua transmiss\u00e3o s\u00e3o m\u00ednimas. O planador arranca do \n\nseu ponto inicial, com o plano das asas em posi\u00e7\u00e3o vertical e com os rotores a trabalharem como \n\npropulsores para faz\u00ea-lo levantar voo, consumindo energia el\u00e9trica. O sistema ascende, e quando o cabo \n\nest\u00e1 completamente estendido, este entra no modo de voo livre, descrevendo uma trajet\u00f3ria circular \n\nrestringida pelo comprimento do cabo. Neste modo de voo, os rotores funcionam como geradores que \n\nconvertem o poder do vento em energia el\u00e9trica. Quando o vento n\u00e3o \u00e9 suficiente para o dispositivo se \n\nmanter no ar, ou por qualquer outro motivo este tem de aterrar, o sistema muda novamente o seu modo \n\nde voo, para poder aterrar no solo. Durante as fases de arranque e aterragem do sistema, a energia \n\nconsumida \u00e9 uma pequena fra\u00e7\u00e3o da energia que \u00e9 produzida no modo de voo livre. \n\nPara simular a opera\u00e7\u00e3o e o comportamento deste equipamento, foi implementado um modelo num\u00e9rico, \n\nproposto por Miles L. Loyd no seu artigo de 1980 \"Crosswind Kite Power\", com o aux\u00edlio do programa \n\ninform\u00e1tico Simulink. No modelo proposto por Loyd, os seus c\u00e1lculos foram realizados tendo como base \n\num avi\u00e3o militar com 68 metros de envergadura e cerca de 230 toneladas. Numa primeira aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\n\n\niv \n \n\na simula\u00e7\u00e3o em Simulink foi testada nas mesmas condi\u00e7\u00f5es que as do modelo criado por Loyd, at\u00e9 os \n\nresultados da simula\u00e7\u00e3o se aproximarem dos obtidos por ele mesmo. Ap\u00f3s isto acontecer, o modelo foi \n\ntestado tendo com os valores do prot\u00f3tipo da Makani, o \u201cM600\u201d, para se poder estudar o seu \n\ncomportamento. Com esta simula\u00e7\u00e3o foi poss\u00edvel concluir que o \u201cM600\u201d descreve um trajeto circular \n\ncom um tamanho da \u00f3rbita de 0.4 radianos, a uma velocidade de aproximadamente 98.7 m/s, variando \n\nentre altitudes de 75 at\u00e9 363 metros. Foi criado tamb\u00e9m um modelo do vento baseado numa Lei de \n\nPot\u00eancia com a velocidade deste a oscilar entre 8.66 e 10.86 m/s. Esta simula\u00e7\u00e3o permitiu ainda concluir \n\nque este prot\u00f3tipo teria uma pot\u00eancia m\u00e9dia \u00e0 sa\u00edda de 0.598 MW aquando da realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de tr\u00eas ciclos \n\ncompletos de rota\u00e7\u00e3o, valor bastante pr\u00f3ximo da pot\u00eancia nominal do \u201cM600\u201d: 0.6 MW. Verificou-se \n\nainda que em alguns momentos a pot\u00eancia registada \u00e0 sa\u00edda excedia a pot\u00eancia nominal, pelo que os \n\ngeradores poder\u00e3o ter de ser sobredimensionados para aceitar estes valores, uma vez que de outra forma \n\nestariam a desperdi\u00e7ar energia. Alternativamente, este fen\u00f3meno pode ser controlado com arrasto \n\nadicional provocado por flaps nas asas ou pelos pr\u00f3prios rotores, que levam a uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o da pot\u00eancia \n\nm\u00e9dia por ciclo. Este processo deve ser assegurado por controladores abordo do sistema. A tens\u00e3o \n\nm\u00e1xima criada no cabo pelo planador foi de aproximadamente 486 kN, sendo este capaz de suportar \n\nestas tens\u00f5es.  \n\nNa realiza\u00e7\u00e3o desta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o foi poss\u00edvel prever de forma concreta o comportamento do \n\ncontrolador do movimento do planador recorrendo a um PID (controlador Proporcional Integral \n\nDerivativo). Apesar desta hip\u00f3tese ter sido testada, os seus resultados foram inconclusivos, com o \n\nplanador a descrever uma trajet\u00f3ria bastante irregular, inclusivamente atravessando o solo com o registo \n\nde cotas negativas. Tendo por base o artigo de Loyd, este controlador \u00e9 definido como a tangente do \n\n\u00e2ngulo de rolamento, que representa a rota\u00e7\u00e3o realizada em torno do eixo longitudinal do planador. Para \n\nesse fim, foi feita uma aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o deste \u00e2ngulo for\u00e7ando o planador a descrever um movimento \n\ncircular uniforme a uma velocidade constante, variando este \u00e2ngulo entre -7 e 47 graus nos pontos de \n\nmaior e menor cota respetivamente. Nos pontos m\u00e9dios da ascens\u00e3o e descida, \u00e0 mesma cota, quando \n\neste est\u00e1 perfeitamente perpendicular \u00e0 dire\u00e7\u00e3o vento, o \u00e2ngulo de rolamento foi considerado zero. Ap\u00f3s \n\nv\u00e1rios testes, a velocidade constante de rota\u00e7\u00e3o para o qual os resultados obtidos mais se aproximavam \n\naos obtidos por Loyd, foi a de 5.5 RPM, com menores erros relativos registados. O facto de o planador \n\ndescrever uma velocidade constante pode trazer algumas incertezas ao modelo, impossibilitando o \n\nc\u00e1lculo de algumas caracter\u00edsticas desta tecnologia como a curva de pot\u00eancia ou o fator de capacidade. \n\nNo entanto fica em aberto um futuro estudo para poder prever o comportamento de um controlador mais \n\nelaborado num eixo com seis graus de liberdade. \n\n \n\n \n\nPalavras chave: \u201cM600\u201d Makani, Miles Loyd, energia e\u00f3lica de alta altitude, Simulink, energia \n\nrenov\u00e1vel  \n\n  \n\n\n\nv \n \n\nAbstract  \n\n \n\nThe potential energy that can be generated by wind should be sufficient to supply all the energy demand \n\nin the world (between 81-118 PWh /year). However, this potential is not always harnessed due to certain \n\nconstraints such as the location of the wind farm and the limitation of turbine heights. \n\nThe technologies for wind power generation at high altitudes, with heights higher than 100 meters, \n\nintend to settle some these problems. The main concern is to understand if these technologies can also \n\ncompete with the conventional wind turbines in terms of energy production, with better cost-quality \n\nrelation. This type of technology has the potential to reduce the investment cost, due to a less complex \n\nstructure than a conventional turbine, and increase the energy produced accessing to higher wind \n\npotential places, resulting in a lower levelized cost of energy. For Makani\u2019s prototype, a levelized cost \n\nof energy of 0.026 \u20ac / kWh is claimed, a considerably lower value when compared to a conventional 2.5 \n\nMW turbine that is around 0.078 \u20ac / kWh. \n\nThe main objective for the development of this dissertation is to evaluate the energy potential that can \n\nbe achieved with the \u201cM600\u201d Makani prototype. This technology is based on a crosswind kite that \n\nproduces energy through mini rotors placed on-board the kite. This energy is transmitted to a ground \n\nstation through an electric conductor tether. To simulate the operation and the behaviour of this \n\nequipment was implemented with the help of Simulink software, the numerical model proposed by Miles \n\nL. Loyd in his article \u201cCrosswind Kite Power\u201d.  \n\nAfter this simulation was possible to conclude that this prototype describes a circular path with an orbit \n\nsize of 0.4 radians, at a velocity of approximately 98.7 m/s, varying between altitudes of 75 and 363 \n\nmeters. A wind model was also created based on a Power Law, with the wind oscillating between 8.66 \n\nand 10.86 m / s. This simulation also led to the conclusion that this prototype would have an average \n\npower output of 0.598 MW after three complete cycles of rotation were performed, a value similar to \n\nthe 0.6 MW of nominal power of the \u201cM600\u201d. The peak tether tension was approximately 486 kN, being \n\nable to withstand the proposed stresses. \n\nIn this dissertation realization wasn\u2019t possible to predict concretely the controller behaviour of the kite \n\nmovement using a PID, since the results were inconclusive. Based on Loyd\u2019s article, this controller was \n\ndefined as the role angle\u2019s tangent, so an approximation of this angle was made forcing the kite to \n\ndescribe the desired motion at a constant speed of 5.5 RPM per cycle. This factor can bring some \n\nuncertainties to the model and makes it impossible to calculate some characteristics of this technology \n\nas the power curve or the capacity factor, however a future study is still open to be able to predict this \n\ncontroller behaviour. \n\n \n\nKeywords: \u201cM600\u201d Makani, Miles Loyd, cross wind kite, high altitude wind power, renewable energy, \n\nSimulink \n\n  \n\n\n\nvi \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nvii \n \n\nContents \n \n\nList of Figures............................................................................................................................ ix \n\nList of Tables ............................................................................................................................. xi \n\nAcronyms and Abbreviations ................................................................................................... xii \n\nNotations.................................................................................................................................. xiv \n\nChapter 1.

Introduction \n \n\n1.1    General Framework \n\n \n\nEnergy resources have been used by mankind for thousands of years to satisfy some of their basic needs \n\nin the form of heat and work, and their availability is one of the main factors for the development of \n\nhumanity. \n\nThe growth in world\u2019s population led, in the last century, to an exponential increase of the demand and \n\nuse of electricity and fossil fuels, including coal, petroleum and natural gas. Despite the benefits that \n\nfossil fuels have brought us in the last century, serious concerns make them unfeasible for the \n\ndevelopment of society due to their finiteness and pollution they cause to the environment. Therefore, \n\nit\u2019s essential to generate alternative sources called renewable energies, that can satisfy the ever-growing \n\nenergy necessities of human beings without compromising their environment.  \n\nMany alternatives to fossil fuels are available and the investment in this area doubled, in developed \n\ncountries, between 1990 and 2000 [1]. Some examples of renewable energies are: wind, solar, \n\ngeothermal, hydropower, tidal and biomass energies. The current state of growth and development of \n\nour society requires a growing, and often unsustainable exploitation of natural resources, which allows \n\nthe creation and scenario predictions in which renewable energy will be the only solution for a society \n\nthat is increasingly in need of new forms of energy. \n\nTraditionally, wind turbines are used to harness wind energy, which require no fuel and do not produce \n\ntoxic neither radioactive wastes. Still, they are huge fixed constructions, and, although they undergo a \n\nlot of research and development to improve their efficiency, they will have reached their limits. \n\nAccording to a 2005 study of the Standford University [2], the potential that can be generated by wind \n\nis sufficient to supply all the energy demand in the world (between 81-118 PWh/year). However, this \n\npotential is not always harnessed due to certain constraints such as the location of the wind farm and the \n\nlimitation of turbine heights. At present, the highest wind turbine reaches 200 meters, where the wind is \n\nstill unstable but with an acceptable speed in order to produce energy [3]. The atmospheric boundary \n\nlayer is the part of the troposphere that is directly influenced by the presence of the Earth's surface, \n\nwhich depending on its roughness has a determinant influence in the wind speed behaviour, which \n\nusually increases with altitude [4]. It is known that the power generated by wind turbines increases with \n\nthe cube of wind velocity (equation 1.1), and higher velocities are expected for higher altitudes (Figure \n\n1.1). In fact, strong wind could be present at higher altitudes with little or no wind at low altitudes.  \n\n \n\n \n\n ???? =\n1\n\n2? ????\n3\n (1.1) \n\n \n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 Map of average wind speed (m / s) with height of 100m (a) and 250m (b) above surface level [5] \n\n \n\nTo overcome this typical wind-turbine limitation, new solutions to extract energy from high altitudes \n\nwinds are still being investigated [3]. The main concern of these technologies is to understand if they \n\ncan also compete with the conventional wind turbines in terms of energy production and with a lower \n\nlevelized cost of energy (LCOE). This parameter is obtained by the following formula: \n\n ????(\u20ac ???? ) =\n????? +  ?\n\n?????\n(1 + ?)?\n\n?\n?=1\n\n?\n????\n\n(1 + ?)?\n?\n?=1\n\n (1.2) \n\n \n\nThe numerator of the latter represents the sum of the capital (initial investment) plus the operational and \n\nmaintenance expenditures throughout its lifetime, and the denominator represents the amount of energy \n\nproduction over its lifetime too, updated with the discount rate (?).  The goal of these new technologies \n\nfor wind extraction at higher altitudes is to increase the denominator and reduce the numerator to \n\ndecrease the LCOE. \n\n \n\n1.2    State of the Art \n\n \n\nIn 1980, an American electrical engineer, member of AIAA, called Miles L. Loyd suggested that lifting a \n\nwind turbine into the atmosphere, at some significant distance above the ground, where winds tend to blow \n\nmore consistently and at greater speed than they do at ground level, could increase the energy production \n\nsignificantly. Loyd thought that if a kite\u2019s aerodynamic surface converts wind energy into motion of the kite, \n\nthis motion could be converted into useful power by driving turbines on the kite or by pulling a load on the \n\nground. His propositions where published in a paper called \u201cCrosswind Kite Power (for Large-Scale Wind \n\nPower Production)\u201d in the Journal of Energy [6], where he predicted that such turbines could generate electricity \n\nat a significant greater magnitude and more consistently than they could if build on the ground.  \n\n \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_and_maintenance\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\nLoyd\u2019s suggestion was largely ignored for many years but has received considerably more attention in the \n\nsecond decade of the twenty-first century. Many companies are still working on designing and/or constructing \n\nof one or more variations of Loyd\u2019s so-called airborne wind turbine, also known as Airborne Wind Energy \n\nSystems (AWES) [7]. So far, many prototypes were tested whit the production of energy, however they \n\nweren\u2019t tested long enough to be marketed.  \n\nThese systems have two ways to operate [8][9]: \n\n \n\n? In Ground-Generator Airborne Wind Energy Systems (GG-AWES), electrical energy is \n\nproduced on the ground by mechanical work done by traction force, transmitted from the \n\naircraft to the ground system through one or more ropes, which produce the motion of an \n\nelectrical generator. Among GG-AWES we can distinguish between fixed-ground-station \n\ndevices, where the ground station is fixed to the ground and moving-ground-station systems, \n\nwhere the ground station is a moving vehicle (Figure 1.2a). \n\n \n\n? In Fly-Generator Airborne Wind Energy Systems (FG-AWES), electrical energy is \n\nproduced on the aircraft and it is transmitted to the ground through a special rope which \n\ncarries electrical cables. In this case, electrical energy conversion is generally achieved \n\nusing wind turbines. FG-AWES produces electric power continuously while in operation, \n\nexcept during take-off and landing manoeuvres in which energy is consumed. Among FG-\n\nAWES it is possible to find crosswind systems and non-crosswind systems depending on \n\nhow they generate energy (Figure 1.2b). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 Airborne Wind Energy Systems. Ground Generation (a) and Fly Generation (b) [8] \n\n \n\n1.2.1 Ground-Gen Airborne Wind Energy Systems \n\n \n\nAs previously anticipated, this kind of devices can be distinguished with fixed or moving ground \n\nstations.  \n\nThe fixed ground station GG-AWES (or Pumping Kite Generators) are among the most exhaustively \n\nstudied by private companies and academic research laboratories. Energy conversion is achieved with a \n\ntwo-phase cycle composed by a generation phase, in which electrical energy is produced, and a recovery \n\nphase, in which energy is consumed. In the generation phase (Figure 1.3a) the aircraft is driven in a way \n\nto produce a lift force and consequently a traction force (unwinding) on the ropes that induce the rotation \n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n4 \n \n\nof the electrical generators producing energy. In the recovery phase (Figure 1.3b) motors rewind the \n\nropes bringing the aircraft back to its original position from the ground. To have a positive balance, the \n\nnet energy produced in the generation phase must be larger than the energy spent in the recovery phase.  \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3 Scheme of the two-phase discontinuous energy production for GG-AWES: Generation (a) and recovery (b) \n\nphases [8] \n\n \n\nThe Italian KiteGen Research was one of the first companies to test a prototype of GG-AWES. The \n\ntechnology developed by this company called \u201cKiteGen Stem\u201d that could reach a nominal power of 3 \n\nMW, is based on an arch-kite that is controlled by two power-ropes winded on winches, that are driven \n\nby a pulley system through a 20 meters flexible rod, called \u2018stem\u2019, which is linked to the top of the \n\nground station. At the beginning of the take-off manoeuvres, the kite is hanged upside down at the end \n\nof the stem, and once it takes off, the generation phase starts, in which the kite makes a crosswind flight \n\nwith \u2018eight shaped\u2019 paths. At the same time ropes are unwinding causing the winches to rotate and the \n\nmotor-generators transform mechanical power into electric power [10]. \n\nThe Ampyx Power, a Dutch company, has developed a glider model that describes an \u2018eight shaped\u2019 \n\npath. After many prototypes, they are currently developing and testing the model AP3 that will be \n\navailable in 2020. This device will have a wingspan of 12 meters, a power output of 250 kW and will \n\nachieve altitudes between 100 and 465 meters. This aircraft has a carbon fibre body, with on-board \n\nsensors and actuators (a rudder, an elevator and four flaperons- two ailerons and two flaps) to control \n\nthe flight path. One tether connects the kite to a single winch in the ground station. When the device \n\nascends, the tether is unwound due to the lifting force acting on the kite. Once the cable is fully extended \n\n(~ 900m), the kite descends from altitude, causing the tether to reel in. This cycle is repeated to the point \n\nwhere there is not enough wind to hold the device, so it lands autonomously in his platform, in the \n\nrecovery phase [11]. \n\nOmnidea, a Portuguese company, designed a tethered inflatable and easily deployable platform. This \n\none keeps the payload airborne by having her mildly lighter than air with the ability to generate by \n\nMagnus effect an aerodynamic lift force that withstands the drag imposed by wind. Since it is a tethered \n\nplatform its subsystems can be permanently fed from the ground minimizing the need to land. This \n\ndevice called LEMAP is in its testing phase, so its power production is unknown [12]. \n\nAt Delft University of Technology, research in kite power generation has been initiated by Professor \n\nWubbo Ockels in 1993. The research group was established in 2005 and currently comprises 2 staff \n\nmembers, 5 researchers, and several MSc students. Recently, Delft University of Technology and \n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\nKarlsruhe University of Applied Sciences started a joint project to continue the development and testing \n\nof a tethered 20 kW experimental pumping kite generator. A main objective of this project is to improve \n\nthe reliability and robustness of the technology and to demonstrate a continuous operation of 24 hours \n\n[13]. They demonstrated fully automatic operation of their 20 kW system in 2012 [14], with a LEI kite \n\nwing of 25m2 wing surface. This prototype is based on a single tether and an airborne control pod, but \n\nthey also control the angle of attack for powering and depowering the wing during production and \n\nrecovery phase, respectively. An automatic launch and retrieval system for 100 m2 LEI kites is under \n\ndevelopment for commercial application [13].  \n\nThe Belgian university KU Leuven began its research on airborne wind energy systems in 2006. After \n\nsignificant theoretical contributions, the team developed a test bench to launch and landing a tethered \n\nglider with a pulley technique. This kite is brought up to speed by an arm rotating around a central axis. \n\nOnce the airplane has gained enough speed, the tether can be unrolled, allowing the airplane to gain \n\naltitude [15]. They are currently developing a larger experimental test set-up, 2 m long with a 10 kW \n\nwinch. \n\nIn addition to pumping systems, a few AWES concepts with moving-ground-station have been \n\nproposed. These ones are generally more complex systems, in which the aim is to provide an always \n\npositive power flow that makes it possible to simplify their connection to the grid by producing a \n\ncontinuously or nearly continuously energy. Differently from the pumping generator, the rope winding \n\nand unwinding is not producing/consuming significant power but is eventually used only to control the \n\naircraft trajectory. The generation takes place thanks to the traction force of ropes that induces the \n\nrotation (or linear motion) of a generator that exploits the ground station movement rather than the rope \n\nwinding mechanism. There are different concepts of moving-ground-station GG-AWES but only a few \n\ncompanies are working on systems like these and there are more patents and studies than prototypes \n\nunder development.  \n\nThe first moving-ground-station project has been proposed by Sequoia Automation and acquired by \n\nKiteGen Research. In this AWES concept called KiteGen Carousel, tethered aircrafts are fixed on the \n\nperiphery of the rotor of a large electric generator with vertical axis. The aircraft forces make their \n\nground stations rotate together with the rotor, which in turn transmits torque to the generator that convert \n\nit into electricity [16]. There is no prototype under development, but the concept has been simulated \n\nshowing that 100 kites with 500 m2 area could generate 1000 MW of average power with a wind speed \n\nof 12 m/s [17]. \n\nAn alternative system based on ground stations that moves on closed track circuits has proposed by \n\nGerman company NTS [18]. Since 2011, NTS started testing a prototype where four tethered kites are \n\ncontrolled by a vehicle which moves on a 400 m flat straight railway track. They can produce up to 1 \n\nkW per m2 of wing area with kites up to 40 m2 [19]. The final product should have a closed loop railway \n\nwhere more vehicles run independently. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n1.2.2 Fly-Generator Airborne Wind Energy Systems \n\n \n\nAs it was said before, in the FG-AWES the conversion of mechanical energy in electrical energy is done \n\non the aircraft, being this energy transmitted to the ground by a tether that has both to conduct electricity \n\nand withstand a strong tension. These systems can be distinguished by its motion into crosswind or non-\n\ncrosswind (stationary) systems.  \n\nThe Californian company Sky Windpower [20] proposed a tethered rotorcraft called Flying Electric \n\nGenerator (FEG) where conventional rotors generate power and simultaneously produce sufficient lift \n\nto keep the system aloft. Four rotors are arranged on an airframe, tethered to the ground by insulated \n\naluminium conductors with Kevlar-type cords wrapping them. The aircraft can be supplied with energy, \n\nto be extended to a desired altitude and to reel the tether to retrieve the craft. When operating \n\nas a power source, two, four, or more rotors are inclined at an adjustable angle to the oncoming wind, \n\ngenerally up to 50\u00ba. The wind on the inclined rotors generates lift and forces rotation, which generates \n\nelectricity [21]. Multiple rotors can be combined in a large-scale array to obtain more energy closer to \n\njet streams. Jet streams are strong air currents, generated by the combination of the planet's rotation over \n\nits axis and atmospheric heating. Usually these are located near the boundaries of adjacent air masses \n\nwith significant temperature differences, such as the transition from the troposphere (where temperature \n\ndecreases with altitude) to the stratosphere (where the temperature increases with altitude) [22]. Sky \n\nWindpower tested two FEG prototypes. At 15 000 ft (4600 m) and above is possible to obtain individual \n\nrated outputs of up to 40 MW [21]. Unfortunately, the company went recently out of business. \n\nThe Altaeros Energies, company founded in 2010 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), \n\nconceived another stationary device: a tethered aerostat (industrial version of blimps and dirigibles) \n\ncalled Bat. The Bat is placed at 600 meters of altitude from the ground, tied to four conductor\u2019s cables, \n\nwith a structure that contains helium, lighter than the air that simplifies the take-off and landing \n\nmanoeuvres, and a rotor with three blades. The Bat concept is not much different from a normal wind \n\nturbine, with the difference of taking advantage of higher wind speeds at higher altitudes. This prototype \n\nhas already been tested and is expected to produce twice the energy of a wind turbine at a conventional \n\nlevel [23]. \n\nFounded in 2008, the US company Joby Energy [24] developed a crosswind multi-frame structure with \n\nembedded aerofoils and turbines installed in his joints. Like other technologies, the take-off and landing \n\nmanoeuvres are accomplished with energy consumption with the rotors of the turbines working as \n\nengines to move the device. Once the tether is fully unwound, the device takes a circular flight path \n\npowered by the wind and the rotors work as generators of energy [25] They claim that with a device \n\nwith an output potential of 2 MW, operating at 2,000 feet of altitude (? 600 meters) can produce 2 \n\nGWh/year with a mean wind speed of 20 m/s. \n\nThe company Makani Power, developed also his own prototype, based on Loyd\u2019s work. This company \n\nwas founded in 2006 with the goal of developing a low-cost renewable energy solution using kite \n\ntechnology [26]. In eight years, they developed and tested several AWES concepts including GG-AWES \n\nwith arch-kites, but their specification was in glider\u2019s models. In 2013 they tested the \u201cWing 7\u201d, a kite \n\nwith 8 meters of wingspan, 20 kW of rated power and four on-board rotors, with a new idea of bimodal \n\nflight to solve take-off and landing issues. In the bimodal flight [27] the device takes off with the wing \n\nplane in a vertical position, driven by its propellers thrust. This flight mode is similar to a quadcopter \n\nflight and rotors are used as engines. Once all the tether has been unwound, the device changes flight \n\nmode, becoming a tethered flight airplane. In this second flight mode a circular flight path is powered \n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\nby the wind itself and rotors are used as generators to convert power from the wind. During this phase \n\nthe cable length is fixed, avoiding the tether fatigue. To land, a new change of flight mode is performed, \n\nand he lands as a quadcopter. After previously investing in the company, Google acquired Makani in \n\n2013 and included them in the project X, a research and development facility [5] Makani is currently \n\ndeveloping a 600 kW prototype, \u2018the M600\u2019. The M600 has eight turbines, each with five propeller \n\nblades, and has a wingspan of 26 m.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.4 Classification of AWES and summary of the different companies/colleges and its prototypes \n\n \n\n1.3  Goals and Dissertation Structure \n\n \n\nThis dissertation goal is to create a numeric model that can predict the power curve and amount of \n\nenergy produced by a cross wind kite based in Makani\u2019s prototype. This model was developed with \n\nSimulink and Matlab, based on the equations from Loyd\u2019s paper \u201cCrosswind Kite Power\" [6] and was \n\nanalysed the impact of several parameters as wind speed, kite size, tether length, roll angle, orbit \n\namplitude and kite\u2019s system of force and compare them with Loyd\u2019s paper results. \n\n The following structure was adopted for the organization of work: \n\n?

Theoretical Concepts \n\n \n\nThis chapter is intended to analyse some aerodynamic concepts allowing to posteriorly characterize the \n\nkite\u2019s motion using Loyd\u2019s equation system.  \n\nIn his model, Loyd compares three power generation models: the relative lift power from a weightless \n\nsimple kite (FS) and from a crosswind kite (FC), and the relative drag power produced by from a \n\ncrosswind kite (FD) [6]. \n\nKites behave like an aerodynamic vehicle restrained by a tether, producing lift ???? and drag ????? as they \n\nmove relative to the air. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 Forces and velocities applied on a simple kite (a) and on a crosswind kite (b) both in lift power production and on \n\na crosswind kite in drag power production (c) [6] \n\n \n\nThe simple kite (Figure 2.1a) faces into the wind, remaining static if the tether is restrained. When the \n\nkite is pulled upwind, by a lift force, that acts on the tether to produce power (FS). That mode of operation \n\nis called lift power production. Looking at Figure 2.1a, ??????? is the relative kite velocity through air, that \n\nis the resulting vector of the wind (???????) and load (???? ?? ) velocity vectors, so his magnitude is given by:  \n\n ?? = ???\n2\n\n+ ??\n2\n (2.1) \n\n \n\nThe angle of attack, represents the angle between the kite\u2019s chord line (imaginary straight line, joining \n\nthe leading and trailing edges of the aerofoil) and the flow direction (???????). If this angle is zero, lift is \n\nnull, in other words, the lift only exists if the angle of attack is greater than zero and for that, the wing \n\nprofile must be asymmetrical. \n\nThe drag (?????), represents the force of resistance to kite\u2019s movement, in the opposite direction to the \n\nkite\u2019s apparent velocity (???????), and perpendicular to ????. ???? is the kite\u2019s tether tension that is always in the \n\ntether\u2019s direction.  \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_attack\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(aeronautics)\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerofoil\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\nIn the case of the crosswind kite (Figure 2.1b), the main difference is that the device does not remain \n\nstatic, moving through the air with a velocity ??????? which is normal to the wind. Power (FC) is generated \n\nby the load created by lifting the kite. The velocity created by this load (???? ??  ) is parallel to ??????? , so the \n\neffective velocity of the wind is reduced to ??????? ? ???? ?? . \n\nPower can also be produced by loading the kite with additional drag (FD), like is shown in the Figure \n\n2.1c. Air turbines on the wing of the kite result in drag power. In this mode of operation, the tether is \n\nnot extensible, so his length is always the same. The total drag ????? is the sum of the drag on the kite ???? ?? ? \n\nand the air turbines drag ???????? , and the velocity created by the load is zero, ???? ?? =0.   \n\nIn the following figure is possible to compare the power output of these three modes of operation: \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 Relative power from the different modes of operation with L/Dk of 10 [6] \n\n \n\nThis last mode of power generation (FD) is the one that will be studied in this MSc dissertation, which \n\nis the mode of operation performed by the M600 prototype. \n\n \n\n2.1  Assumptions \n\n \n\nIn Loyd\u2019s paper, some assumptions were made that need to be referred and taken into account \n\nthroughout this dissertation.  \n\nA better understanding of the efficiencies of the kite or the turbine depends on the design details, which \n\nare beyond the scope of the paper, so the kite and turbine are assumed to have no losses. Based on that, \n\nthat assumption has an error between 10 and 20%. The efficiencies of the additional power conversions \n\nrequired to deliver shaft power at the ground were also not considered.  \n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\nThe criteria for the efficiencies of a kite or its turbines are different from those used by Betz. The kite \n\nsweeps out an annulus that could be compared to a turbine disk. However, the section occupied in this \n\nannulus by the kite is much smaller than the one occupied by the turbine blades and consequently the \n\nslowing of the wind is smaller too. In the Betz sense, if this slowdown effect is small, the kite's efficiency \n\nwill be low. However, the power produced is higher than it would be if the kite were flying in wind that \n\nhad been more slowed down. Since calculations of kite performance have resulted in Betz efficiencies \n\nof a few percentage points, the induced effects of the kite slowing the wind are assumed to be negligible.  \n\nThe wind was assumed to blow only along the x-axis. \n\n \n\n2.2  Equations System \n\n \n\nTo predict the flight path of the kite it\u2019s necessary to define its equations system. To reach this goal, this \n\nsystem was obtained based on Loyd\u2019s model [6].  \n\n  \n\n2.2.1 Spherical Coordinates  \n\n \n\nA spherical coordinate system is a coordinate system for three-dimensional space where the position of \n\na point is specified by three numbers: the radial distance of that point from a fixed origin (R), the polar \n\nangle measured from a fixed zenith direction (? ? theta), and the azimuth angle of its orthogonal \n\nprojection on a reference plane that passes through the origin and is orthogonal to the zenith (? ? phi), \n\nmeasured from a fixed reference direction on that plane. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 Representation of kite\u2019s motion, spherical coordinates, velocities components and unit vectors [6] \n\n \n\nThe Figure 2.3 illustrates the parameters allowing the characterization of the kite\u2019s motion which will \n\nbe defined further ahead in this dissertation. \n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\n2.2.2 Velocities \n\n \n\nIn Loyd\u2019s paper, the velocity of the kite, also called ground speed, is defined as:  \n\n ???? = ?(??? ? + ???????????) (2.2) \n\n \n\nAnd assuming that wind only blows along the abscissa axis, so: \n\n ????? = ??  (????????? ?  ????????? +  ????????????) (2.3) \n\n \n\nThe important quantity in the generation of lift is the relative velocity between the object and the air, \n\nalso called airspeed. Airspeed cannot be directly measured from a ground position, it must be computed \n\nfrom the ground speed and the wind speed. Airspeed is the vector difference between the ground speed \n\nand the wind speed [28].

Numeric Implementation \n \n\nIn a preliminary stage of a project, it is very important to use tools that gives us the chance to test several \n\nsolutions and to predict (and overcome) some problems that may exist in the future. Nowadays, there \n\nare plenty of computer simulation which programs makes this possible, and in this dissertation, the \n\nprogram chosen to simulate the crosswind kite behaviour was Simulink version 8.5, an extension of \n\nMATLAB R2015a.  \n\nIn the next subchapters will be described the numeric implementation of the model in \n\nSimulink/MATLAB. \n\n \n\n3.1  Initial Conditions \n\n \n\nAs first approach, as it shown in Loyd\u2019s paper [6], it was created a model based on a C-5A aircraft \n\n(Figure 3.1), a large military transport aircraft  with 68 meters of wingspan [30]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 C-5A model aircraft [31] \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nhttps://www.linguee.pt/ingles-portugues/traducao/preliminary+stage.html\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_transport_aircraft\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n18 \n \n\nIn Loyd\u2019s paper, he studied three examples of large-scale power production, resumed on Table 3.1: \n\n \n\nTable 3.1 Examples of Loyd's article calculations \n\n Example I II III \n\nKite \n\nWing area (m2) 576 1000 2000 \n\nLift-to-drag ratio 20 40 40 \n\nStrength-to-weight ratio 10 10 10 \n\nCoefficient of lift 1 1 1 \n\nTether \n\nLength (m) 400 1200 1200 \n\nWorking stress (MPa) 345 345 345 \n\nDensity (Mg/m3) 8 8 8 \n\nCoefficient of drag 0.04 0.04 0.04 \n\nWind Speed (m/s) 10 10 10 \n\nResults of \n\ncalculation \n\nAverage power output (MW) 6.7 19 45 \n\nPeak tether tension (MN) 3.2 10.6 22.2 \n\n \n\nThe kite and tether\u2019s parameters, of example I, were applied in a Matlab\u2019s model which recognize them \n\nas constants in his algorithm (see Attachment 1). The tether\u2019s coefficient of drag is a fairly undersized \n\nvalue for a circular cylinder shape, however since the tether shroud need not produce lift [6], that value \n\nwas approximated to the drag coefficient of a streamlined body . To verify the model, the final results \n\nmust approach to average power output and peak tether tension of example I, which are 6.7 MW and \n\n3.2 MN, respectively. \n\n \n\n3.2  Simulink Model  \n\n \n\nSimulink, developed by MathWorks, is a graphical programming environment for modelling, simulating \n\nand analysing multidomain dynamic systems. Simulink is integrated with MATLAB, enabling the user \n\nto incorporate MATLAB algorithms into models and export simulation results to MATLAB for further \n\nanalysis. This program is widely used in automatic control and digital signal processing for \n\nmultidomain simulation and Model-Based Design (MBD). MBD is a mathematical and visual method \n\nof addressing problems associated with designing complex control, signal processing and \n\ncommunication systems. Rather than using complex structures and extensive software code, designers \n\ncan use Model-based design to define plant models with advanced functional characteristics using \n\ncontinuous-time and discrete-time building blocks [32].  \n\nThis blocks model was created with the equations system defined in chapter 2 and was structured with \n\nblue blocks that represents subsystems of the main system, that will be described more detailed below \n\n(see Attachment 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathWorks\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_systems\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_control\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-based_design\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n19 \n \n\n \n\n3.2.1 Spherical Coordinates \n\n \n\nThis subsystem is the base for this model implementation, once as anticipated in the chapter 2.2.1, the \n\nspherical coordinates definition will allow the prediction of the kite\u2019s motion in three-dimensional space.  \n\nThe kite flight path is circular about an orbit axis directly downwind from the anchor point, one radian \n\ndown from the z axis and 0.4 radians up to orbit axis. To define this, it was considered the time function \n\nof the angular position of a uniform circular motion: \n\n ? = ?0 +  ?0?. ? (3.1) \n\n \n\nWhere ?0 is the initial position of the kite, and ?0? his derivative given in radians per second. As a first \n\naproximation, ?0 = 0 ??? and ?0? = 3 ??? (\n?\n\n10\n ???/?), which means that the kite gives a full rotation \n\nin 20 seconds. It was considered that ? is zero in the highest position (when the altitude is maximum) \n\nand the kite moves in counter-clockwise direction, so ? increases in this way as shown in Figure 3.2. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 Representation of the Beta parameter \n\n  \n\nTo define the spherical coordinates it was used the Rodrigues\u2019s formula rotation [33], an efficient \n\nalgorithm for rotating a vector in a 3D space, given an axis (?)  and angle of rotation (?) defined by: \n\n ???? = ? cos ? + (? \u00d7 ?) sin ? + ?(? ? ?)(1 ? cos ?) (3.2) \n\n \n\n? is a vector in ?3 and ? is a unit vector describing an axis of rotation about which ? rotates by an \n\nangle ? according to the right hand rule. In this case, ? is the vector represented in Figure 2.3 by orbit \n\naxis that is defined in the spherical coordinate system by [1 1 0]; ? is the vector defined by spherical \n\ncoordinates [R ? ?]; and ? is the angle of rotation defined by  ? in equation 3.1. (? \u00d7 ?) and (? ? ?) \n\nare, respectively, the cross and the dot product between ? and ? vectors. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric)\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_angle\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_rotation\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_hand_rule#Direction_associated_with_a_rotation\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n20 \n \n\nTo apply equation 3.2, was used the \u201cMATLAB Function\u201d block, presented in Simulink library. This \n\nblock allows the inclusion of a Matlab function in the Simulink model, where is necessary to specify its \n\ninputs and outputs. In this case, the input is ? which is already defined in Simulink model, and the return \n\nvalues (outputs) are the spherical coordinates (????). ? and ? are specified in block editor, where ? must \n\nbe defined as the first position of the kite, when ? = 0, that is [400 0.6 0].  The desired ???? must be in \n\nthe form of spherical coordinates (R,?, ?), however to use the Rodrigues formula, these must be in \n\ncartesian coordinates (x,y,z) so is necessary to use the coordinate systems conversions [34]: \n\n \n\nTable 3.2 Coordinate systems conversions \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe output, ???? gives a three columns matrix, where the first one is the radial distance (R) which is a \n\nconstant value, and the second and third columns are respectively the polar (?) and azimuth angles (?) \n\nobtained for each value of ?. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 Spherical coordinates representation for 3 RPM in one cycle of rotation (20 seconds) \n\nSpherical to Cartesian Cartesian to Spherical \n\n? = ? sin ? cos ? ? = ??2 + ?2+?2 \n\n? = ? sin ? sin ? ? = cos\n?1 (\n\n?\n\n??2 + ?2+?2\n) = cos?1 (\n\n?\n\n?\n) \n\n? = ? cos ? ? = tan?1 (\n?\n\n?\n) \n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n21 \n \n\n \n\nBased in Table 3.2, is possible to convert these spherical to cartesian coordinates, that allows to know \n\nstrictly the spatial position of the kite. The block \u201cDerivative\u201d of Simulink, allows to obtain the time \n\nderivative of spherical (\n??\n\n??\n,\n\n??\n\n??\n) and cartesian (\n\n??\n\n??\n,\n\n??\n\n??\n,\n\n??\n\n??\n) coordinates which are used in equations 2.2, \n\n2.5, 2.6, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14 and 2.15 with the notation of ??? and ??.

To insert these and all the equations of Chapter 2.2 in the Simulink model, was \n\nused the \u201cFcn\u201d block, which applies the specified mathematical expression to its inputs. The inputs, \n\nequations and outputs of this subsystem are illustrated in Figure 3.5: \n\n \n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n22 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5 Representation of the block \u201cVelocities\u201d operation \n\n \n\nTo obtain these values is necessary to estimate the wind speed (equation 2.3). In a first approximation, \n\nlike in Loyd\u2019s paper, it was considered the constant value of 10 m/s for Vw, then it was considered a \n\nwind model to estimate his variation with the altitude in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). The \n\nABL is the part of troposphere that is directly influenced by the Earth's surface presence and responds \n\nto this influence with a time scale of about an hour or less.  The air layer above the ABL is called the \n\nfree atmosphere. The ABL depth is quite variable, but it\u2019s generally below 2 to 3 km [35]. The diurnal \n\nvariability and the high frequency of turbulence near the ground are characteristics that distinguish the \n\nABL from the rest of the atmosphere. \n\nThe mean velocity profile of a turbulent atmospheric boundary layer can be obtained by two ways [36]:  \n\nBy the Prandtl\u2019s logarithmic law, commonly called wall law, which can be described as:  \n\n ?(?) =\n??\n?\n\n?? (\n?\n\n?0\n) (3.3) \n\n \n\nwhere ?? is the friction velocity in the ground, k is the universal Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n constant, h is the height \n\nand ?0 is the surface roughness length; \n\nOr by a power law assumption, which allows the calculation of speed values from a reference value: \n\n \n?(?)\n\n????\n= (\n\n?\n\n????\n)\n\n?\n\n (3.4) \n\n \n\nwhere ????  is the velocity of wind at the height of ????  and ? is a parameter which varies in function of \n\nthe surface roughness.  \n\nTo obtain the wind profile it was used the equation 3.4  instead of equation 3.3, because it\u2019s difficult to \n\npredict the ground friction velocity (??). The ? parameter was defined as 1/7, typical of mostly flat \n\n?\n\n?\n\n???\n\n??\n\n? = ? ??? ? + ???????\n\n?? = ???? ? ?? ????????\n\n?? = ??? ???? + ?? ????\n\n?? = ??? ????????\n\n?? = ?? ? + ?? ? + ?? ?\n\n??\n\n??\n\n??\n\n??\n\n??\n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n23 \n \n\nsurfaces with little roughness (excluding water, snow and ice), like the locals where this system will \n\noperate [37]. Based on a 2000 study carried out by Cristina L. Archer and Mark Z. Jacobson, they \n\nconcluded that locations with appreciable wind power potential (class ? 32), can register a mean V10 \n\n(wind speed from an elevation of 10 m) of 6,50 m/s at onshore stations [2]. With these values and in \n\nconsistency with the wind speed of 10 m/s considered in Loyd\u2019s paper, it is possible to obtain the \n\ncorresponding height, by applying equation 3.4, which gives a value of 204 m, a consistent value taken \n\ninto account the kite mean altitude (Figure 3.4). Resorting again to equation 3.4, it is possible to \n\nconstruct the wind model for this situation, knowing that h is the altitude of the kite which is given by \n\nthe multiplication of  ???? for the tether length (see Table 3.2). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.6 Graphic representation of wind model and his corresponding altitude (top graph) and kite and apparent velocities \n\n(bottom graph) to 3 RPM \n\n \n\n In the first plot of Figure 3.6 is possible to observe, as already mentioned in chapter 1.1, that the growth \n\nand decrease of the wind speed (black line) is proportional to the altitude (red line). This graph also \n\nintends to show the contrast between the two models used to represent the wind variation: assuming the \n\nwind constant (neglecting the wind boundary layer effect - blue line) and variable (black line). In the \n\ngraphic below is possible to see that V (orange line) and VA (cyan and green lines) both have a much \n\ngreater magnitude than Vw, and as previously noted VA = V-Vw. Then it is predictable that wind velocity \n\ndoes not cause much variation in VA, whether constant or variable given the range of altitudes seen by \n\nthe kite and the boundary layer conditions assumed. Also, since in this model the speed of rotation is \n\nbeing enforced, the speed of the kite (V) is approximately constant (orange line). \n\n \n\n                                                           \n2 At a specified height above the ground, each class represents a range of mean power density (W/m2), with class 1 winds \ncontaining the least energy and class 7 winds containing the most energy. Each class has equivalent wind speed ranges, but \n\nthese are dependent on the height at which the wind map is referring. In this dissertation the class is referred to a height of 80 \n\nmeters. \n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n24 \n \n\n3.2.3 Roll Angle Variation \n\n \n\nOne of the challenges with using a kite type system for extracting wind energy is his susceptibility to \n\ngusts and turbulence, in other words, variations in the wind speed can disturb the system significantly, \n\ncausing it to enter into an unrecoverable spin or dive. It\u2019s important to be able to establish whether the \n\nsystem is capable of following a desired trajectory determined in the presence of variations in the wind \n\nspeed around the mean. Then, it is necessary to stablish some kind of control to maximize the generated \nenergy. In Loyd\u2019s paper the control action is guaranteed by the tangent of roll angle figured by C letter, \n\nwhich is not defined in the paper, so it is necessary to characterize it. \n\nThe roll angle is the rotation operation performed around the longitudinal axis of the kite [38]. Positive \n\nangles correspond to the starboard (right) wing lowered below the horizontal plane, that leads the kite \n\nto fly to the right and negative angles corresponds to the opposite like illustrated in Figure 3.7. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7 Variation of roll angle about the kite horizontal plane [39] \n\n \n\nTo get an approximation of C, the equation 2.14 was used, which gives the second order derivative of \n\nthe spherical coordinate ?, that was already calculated. Looking at Figure 3.3,  ? has three roots. These \n\nthree points corresponds to the positions ? = 0, ? and 2? but as representative of a looping motion the \n\nfirst and last positions represent the same. By definition, the second derivative has the same roots of his \n\nown function, so equating equation 2.14 to zero and solving in order to C it\u2019s possible to obtain his \n\nvalues for the positions of ? = 0 and ?. To help with this calculation, the function \u201cfzero\u201d of Matlab \n\nwas used. In the sides (? = ? 2?  and \n3?\n\n2? )  the roll angle was assumed to be zero (C=0), when the kite \n\nis directly downwind and upwind. In the next figure is possible to see the value of the roll angle in each \n\none of these positions. \n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n25 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8 Representation of the kite position and the respective values of roll angle in four positions for 3 RPM \n\n \n\nThe obtained results for the roll angle are in agreement with the flight path of the kite: the negative roll \n\nangle lifts the right wing and lowers the left wing and the kite descends to the left, the positive angle \n\nlowers the right wing and lifts the left wing and the kite ascends to the left.

For 8 RPM the discrepancy is even higher, with relative errors bigger than 100%. \n\nAfter making the test for 5 and 6 RPM became obvious that the best result lies in a range between these \n\nvalues, so was made an intermediate test for 5.5 RPM. Therefore, observing the results in its overall, the \n\nchosen velocity was 5.5 RPM, where the result of the average power output gets very close to the desired \n\none, with a relative error inferior to 1% and the peak tether tension with a relative error of 19%. It\u2019s \n\ninteresting to see that the tether\u2019s thickness increases with the growth of the tension, by application of \n\nequation 3.7, which leads to the conclusion that higher tensions require stronger tethers.   \n\nTo approximate the results to the reality, the wind model described in sub-chapter 3.2.2 was applied, \n\nand its results are presented also in Table 3.3, so the model created with these conditions is the chosen \n\none as representative of the kite\u2019s flight path and his graphs and results are presented in the attachments \n\n(see Attachment 3 and Attachment 4). In the next chapter this model will be applied to the study case, \n\nthe Makani prototype. \n\n  \n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n30 \n \n\nChapter 4. Study Case \n\n \n\nIn this chapter will be analysed with more detail, the model \u201cM600\u201d of the Makani Power company, to \n\nrealize what is its energy potential. With this propose, the model created in Chapter 3, based on a C-5A \n\naircraft, will be now calculated with M600 characteristics.  \n\n \n\n4.1  Makani Power Prototype \n\n \n\nMakani Power the Californian company, founded in 2006 by Corwin Hardham, Don Montague and Saul \n\nGriffith, was created with the goal of developing a low-cost renewable energy solution using kite \n\ntechnology [26]. After many years testing several prototypes, in 2016 they finish their first commercial \n\nscale system, a kite called \u201cM600\u201d with a rated power of 600 kW and 26 meters of wingspan (see Figure \n\n4.1).   \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 Makani's prototype- M600 [40] \n\n \n\nAs seen in the previous figure, this prototype has eight turbines mounted along the wings, each drives a \n\npermanent magnet motor/generator that generates electricity on-board, when they are crossed by \n\nairflow. Direct-drive generator units of high power density are supported by the strength and \n\naerodynamic leverage of its wings. The wing is made by a composite material which includes e-glass in \n\nits skin and carbon fibre in the spar, a high tensile strength and low weight material, which favour the \n\nkite flight manoeuvres due to L/D ratio. For airplanes, this ratio is also referred to as the gliding number, \n\nit describes how faster a kite without propulsion can move horizontally compared to its vertical sink \n\nrate. The material properties of the tether are important as a tether needs to withstand strong tensions \ndue to high velocity winds. A high voltage tether is required to transmit the electricity to ground level, \n\nalthough the tether weight is an important constraint which could increase the load on the kite. For their \n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n31 \n \n\nprototype, M600 tether is made in pultruded carbon fibre with a working stress of 2137 MPa and a \n\ndensity of 1760 kg/m3 [41] which is 6 times stronger, and 4 times less dense than steel used in Loyd\u2019s \n\nmodel. The voltage conductor is aluminium, which because its low electrical impedance ensure that the \n\npower lost along the tether is minimal. This tether with 440 meters length, allows the kite to reach \n\naltitudes between 140 to 310 meters.  \n\nThe kite takes off from the ground station with the wing plane in a vertical position, driven by the turbine \n\nrotors that are used as propellers, like a quadcopter. Once the tether is all unwinded, the device changes \n\nflight mode becoming a tethered flight fully autonomous airplane, describing a circular flight path \n\npowered by the wind, which is restricted by the tether length. In this flight mode the turbine rotors work \n\nas generators to convert power from the wind that is transmitted to the ground station by the conductor \n\ntether. In order to land the kite, a new change of flight mode is made, and the device returns to the \n\nground station as a quadcopter. During the take-off and landing phases the device consumes energy, a \n\nminimal fraction of the energy which is produced in the autonomous flight mode. In the next figure is \n\nsummarized the operation of M600 device: \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 M600 bimodal flight [42] \n\n \n\nThe potential failure of either the device or the tether must be considered in regard to ground safety. In \n\ncase of the device failure, such as rotor failure due to mechanical malfunctions, the worst scenario is \n\nthat the radius of influence will be the tether length, so at least one tether length must be guaranteed as \n\nsafety perimeter. In the case of a fatal tether failure, the M600 on-board generating systems could land \n\nsafely with the use of their rotors as a quadcopter, given that there is energy storage available \n\notherwise the device could float away. Makani has implemented a supervisory control and data \n\nacquisition system that will control and monitor the health of the device including sensors to detect \n\nimpendence in individual sections of the tether [43]. There are also, regulation and safety procedures \n\nwhich need to be fulfilled, so Makani is committed to working with the Federal Aviation \n\nAdministration (FAA) of USA to open a safe AWES farm for the operation of several devices. In a \n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n32 \n \n\nresponse to FAA [42], they explain how they expect to ensure the safety of its devices and some \n\nupcoming tests that need to be done as the operation at night, over long periods of time (weeks, \n\nmonths) and up to 610 meters above ground level and study multiple system farm environments. In \n\nthis response they specify some characteristics of M600 which will be useful to the next subchapter as \n\nthe wing area of 35 m2, the coefficient of lift of 2 and the wing mass of 1050 kg. \n\n \n\n4.2  Numerical Implementation \n\n \n\nIn this subchapter is intended to compare the new inputs for the model created in chapter 3 and compare \n\nthem with the Loyd\u2019s values so then shown their outputs. This comparison is shown in the next table: \n\n \n\nTable 4.1 Comparation between C-5A aircraft and Makani prototype M600 \n\n \nC-5A Aircraft  \n\n(Loyd model) \n\nM600 prototype  \n\n(Makani) \n\nWing area (m2)- A 576 35 \n\nKite Weight (kg) 232 693 1 050 \n\nKite coefficient of lift (CL) 1 2 \n\nKite coefficient of drag (CD) 0.05 0.05 \n\nTether coefficient of drag (CDT) 0.04 0.04 \n\nLift-to-Drag ratio (L/D) 20 40 \n\nTether\u2019s length (m)- R 400 440 \n\nTether\u2019s working Stress (MPa)- ? 345 2 137 \n\nTether\u2019s Density (kg/m3)- ??  8 000 1 760 \n\nTether\u2019s Material Steel Carbon fibre \n \n\nLooking at previous table, it\u2019s possible to see that C-5A is approximately 16 times bigger and 220 times \n\nheavier than M600, however with half of the lift coefficient. Typically, a lift coefficient of 2 is difficult \n\nto achieve, so this could be a little over estimated, but due to the Makani confidentiality, its actual value \n\nisn\u2019t really known. This discrepancy intends to show a better climbing performance by the M600 design, \n\nrevealed in a higher gliding number (L/D), once the kite\u2019s drag coefficient was considered the same. \n\nThe tether drag coefficient was also considered the same of C-5A because the resemblance of cylindrical \n\nshape facing the wind. However, as said before, the tether material of both devices will influence the \n\nflying performance, therefore M600\u2019s carbon fibre tether is stronger (can withstand greater tensions) \n\nand less dense than C-5A\u2019s steel tether. The drag coefficients of both the kite and tether might be \n\nimproved, thanks to the surface treatment that force the turbulent boundary layer and reduce drag \n\n(similar to the effect of a golf ball surface). However, due to the uncertainty of their actual values, which \n\nstill may be in research processes, they were kept the same.  \n\n \n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n33 \n \n\n4.3  Results Discussion \n\n \n\nAfter setting the new inputs in Table 4.1, is possible now to re-run the model created in Chapter 3. The \n\nobtained results are presented next: \n\n  \n\nTable 4.2 Comparation between the results obtained for the C-5A and M600 \n\n C-5A Aircraft  \n\n(Loyd model) \n\nM600 prototype \n\n(Makani) \n\nAverage power output (MW) 6.674 0.5981 \n\nPeak tether tension (MN) 2.390 0.486 \n\nKite speed (m/s) 89.700 98.670 \n\nAverage apparent speed (m/s) 90.180 99.200 \n\nTether\u2019s thickness (cm) 9.39 4.08 \n\n \n\nLooking at Table 4.2 it\u2019s possible to verify that M600\u2019s average power output gets close to its nominal \n\npower of 600 kW. That fact reveals some consistence in the model proposed by Loyd, showing that it\u2019s \n\npossible to produce energy by the drag force actuating in a crosswind kite, which he called drag power \n\nproduction. Despite both kites fly at 5.5 RPM, the M600 reaches a higher apparent velocity of about 357 \n\nkm/h due to its larger tether. This apparent velocity is the one which really contributes to make the \n\nturbines in the wing spinning and produce energy. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 Absolute value of forces acting on M600 and his tether for three cycles of rotation  \n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n34 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4 Absolute value of forces acting on C-5A and his tether for three cycles of rotation  \n\n \n\nIn these two figures it\u2019s possible to see the absolute values of the forces acting in M600 (Figure 4.3) and \n\nC-5A (Figure 4.4), where the force with greater magnitude is lift, keeping the devices in the air, despite \n\nthe tether tension overcome it in some instants in the case of M600. The pultruded carbon fibre material \n\nused in M600 structure grants him a low weight that can be almost negligible in the global system of \n\nforces, when compared with the C-5A weight which has more impact, like is showed in the first plot of \n\nFigure 4.4. The C-5A higher weight (either kite and tether) increases the load on the kite, meaning that \n\nit needs to generate more lift to sustain the tether with a value of around 3 MN and the opposite in the \n\nM600 kite with around 0.43 MN of magnitude. The higher density of the steel concedes to the C-5A \n\ntether a weight of about 85 kN, a higher value when compared with the carbon fibre\u2019s M600 tether with \n\na weight of 1.4 kN approximately. \n\nThe M600 kite\u2019s drag is also minimal as in C-5A, due to their aerodynamic wings design, not affecting \n\ntoo much their motion. The maximum tension registered in the M600 tether was 0.49 MN, which \n\ncombined with a greater carbon fibre\u2019s working stress, allows a diameter of 4 centimetres, 5 centimetres \n\nthinner tether than the C-5A one (Table 4.2). This thinner tether results in a minimal tether drag with a \n\nmean value of 1.4 kN while the C-5A tether drag has a mean value of 63 kN. However, it\u2019s important \n\nto understand if the kite can withstand the tensions induced by the tether. \n\nThe tether is capable of withstand the proposed stresses if the peak tether tension is lower than the \n\nmaximum breaking tension. The maximum breaking tension is the maximum force that can be supported \n\nby the tether over its sectional area. Therefore, this value can be obtained by the product of the tether\u2019s \n\nworking stress (Table 4.1) and its section area given by ?(d/2)2 (Table 4.2), due to its circular shape. \n\nThat gives a maximum breaking tension of around 2.69 MN, which is a much bigger value when \n\ncompared with the peak tether tension registered: 0.49 MN (Table 4.2), then this tether can withstand \n\nthe proposed stresses.  \n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n35 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5 Sum of the forces actuating in the kite (lift, drag, tether tension and weight) in each components of the unit \n\nvectors l (? direction), m (? direction) and n (radial direction) \n\n \n\nThe previous figure represents the sum of the forces that act in the kite in each of their components: ?, ????? \n\nand ????. Is interesting to verify that the sum of forces acting in the kite\u2019s centre of pressure in the radial \n\ndirection (????) are almost null, which prove that the tether is fully extended. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6 Power produced over time and respective amount of energy \n\n \n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n36 \n \n\nThe previous figure represents the variation of the power produced over time, calculated by the product \n\nbetween the drag power (DP) and the apparent velocity (equation 2.23).  This power drag is 1/3 of the \n\ndrag which is induced in the total system, increasing them in 50%. In this plot was interesting to calculate \n\nthe integral between the interval [0, 32.73] seconds, by the trapezoidal method. That gives the area of \n\nthe region bounded by its graph, which corresponds to the energy produced by the M600 in three cycles \n\nof rotation, which is approximately 5.45 kWh. With the device working for one hour without any \n\ninterruption, it would produce 599.92 kWh.  \n\nStill looking at this plot is possible to conclude that the turbine generators may need to be over \n\ndimensioned, to accept up to the nominal power of 600 kW, because otherwise they would be wasting \n\nenergy. Typically, this phenomenon could be controlled with additional drag provoked by flaps in the \n\nwings or by the turbine rotors themselves, that lead to the reduction of the average power over cycle.  \n\nThis additional drag must be assured by the on-board controllers.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n37 \n \n\nChapter 5. Conclusions \n \n\nIn 1980, the engineer Miles L. Loyd suggested that lifting a wind turbine into the atmosphere, at some \n\nsignificant distance above the ground, where winds tend to blow more consistently and at greater speed than \n\nthey do at ground level, could increase the energy production significantly. His suggestion was ignored for \n\nmany years but in the second decade of the twenty-first century has received considerably more attention. \n\nLoyd\u2019s tested his model in a large military aircraft (C-5A), a study absolutely theoretical that intended \n\nonly to demonstrate the potential that is possible to achieve from wind extraction at high altitudes (higher \n\nthat 200 meters) but unfeasible in practical terms due to its high weight. In 2016, Makani company \n\nstarted developing the M600, a technology designed for large generating capacity that intends to \n\naccomplish Loyd\u2019s ideas for drag power production. This prototype is a substantially smaller aircraft \n\nmade with different materials and autonomous controls that increase the aerodynamics of the kite.  \n\nIn this dissertation, the goal was to predict the behaviour of the M600, and study how much energy he \n\ncould produce. The kite takes approximately 10.91 seconds to make each full rotation in the counter-\n\nclockwise direction, with an orbit size of 0.4 radians, a constant velocity of approximately 98.67 m/s \n\n(5.5 RPM) and an average apparent velocity of 99.20 m/s which contributes to make the on-board \n\nturbines to spin and produce energy. It was considered a wind model to predict his variation with \n\naltitude, oscillating between 8.66 and 10.86 m/s to altitudes between 75 and 363 meters (Figure 3.6), \n\nhowever with a wind speed constant of 10 m/s the obtained results are very similar like it\u2019s showed in \n\nTable 3.3.  \n\nTo maintain an accurate orbit, the flight was controlled by the variation of the tangent of the roll angle, \n\nwhich is defined in equation 3.6 by C letter. To re-run the Simulink model with the values of M600, it \n\nwas necessary to calculate again the roll angle in equation 3.5, so the newly obtained values for Roll \n\nangle (?=0) and Roll angle (?=?) were -7.25 and 46.68 respectively.  These values are very similar to \n\nthe ones obtained for C-5A (see Attachment 3), therefore these changes in C calculation has no \n\nsignificant influence in the final results. It can be concluded that this control action isn\u2019t the most correct \n\nway to ensure that the kite takes the desired path. In fact, a more accurate controller should be needed \n\nthat can adjust the kite in its six degrees of freedom, capable of respond within compatible time lags to \n\ndisturbances in the system. \n\nThe obtained results show some consistency with the expected ones, with an average power output of \n\n0.5981 MW, very close to the M600 nominal power and peak tether tension of 0.49 MN, a value that \n\nthe kite is able to withstand. However, the turbine generators may need to be over dimensioned because \n\nthe device registers values above the nominal power and in that case would be wasting energy. To assure \n\nvalues below the 600 kW, additional drag may be induced by flaps or by the turbine rotors.  \n\nMany assessment issues regarding safety and aviation authority, that are beyond the goal of this \n\ndissertation, must be approved before these devices can be marketed. It is important to understand the \n\ninteraction of these devices within a farm, the consequences of a tether or device failure to avoid \n\nunnecessary accidents, the localization where these devices will operate that will depend on weather \n\ngroundings and the ground area occupied to build a wind farm [44]. Despite this, in 2017 Makani \n\npublished a 37 minutes video on their personal page at Youtube, showing a full test flight of the M600 \n\nprototype [45], an enticing video that shows that this prototype truly works. \n\n \n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n38 \n \n\n5.1  Future Work \n\n \n\nOne of the challenges in this MSc dissertation was to predict the velocity of rotation, for the kite to \n\nfollow the desired trajectory. So, the flight path was approached by the time function of the angular \n\nposition of a uniform circular motion (equation 3.1). This approach does not portray the real behaviour \n\nof the system, since the speed of the M600 will depend on external conditions such as wind speed and \n\nalthough the variation of wind speed has been taken into account in the model, this revealed not to cause \n\ngreat changes in the output power of the system. It would be interesting to trace a power curve and \n\ncalculate the capacity factor of the device with a more realistic value for the tether\u2019s coefficient of drag, \n\nusing a more detailed model.  \n\nTo try to solve this problem, a closed loop model was made, therefore after the calculation of ??? and ??, \n\ntheir integral was obtained which gives the velocity components and their second integral gives the \n\nposition components: ? and ?. In this model it wasn\u2019t necessary to resort to Rodrigues\u2019s formula or \n\ndefine the beta (?) parameter, since the position and velocity of rotation of the kite were calculated \n\nautomatically by the model, however for the kite to follow the desired trajectory, a correct controller \n\nmust be used. For that, a proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative (PID) controller was tested, which is a control \n\nloop feedback mechanism. The PID controller continuously calculates an error value as the difference \n\nbetween a desired setpoint and a measured process variable and applies a correction based \n\non proportional, integral, and derivative terms (denoted P, I, and D respectively). To apply this PID \n\ncontroller, those three terms must be defined, however after several tests the desired flight path wasn\u2019t \n\ntaken, as can be seen in the Figure 5.1, with the kite describing a very irregular trajectory, which even \n\ncrosses the ground with negative heights.  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1 Flight path described by the kite in the closed loop model \n\n \n\nAs the results of this model did not allow to get conclusions, the open model was used in this dissertation. \n\nHowever, it remains open for a future study, the development of a controller that allows to rectify not \n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n39 \n \n\nonly the roll angle but also the other degrees of freedom of the kite as the yaw and pitch angles, the \n\nvariation of the wind angle of attack in function of his direction and the match of kite\u2019s velocity with a \n\nrealist tether drag coefficient. This implementation would improve the results of the closed loop.  \n\nIt\u2019s also important to be made a future study from an economic point of view, to predict if this technology \n\ncan compete with the traditional ones. The value of its operational expenditures (OpExt) is a major \n\nquestion which need to be clarified and will help to realize if this technology is viable. One advantage \n\nof the M600 is the use of a fixed tether length. As it isn\u2019t being always winded up and unwinded this \n\ncan reduce the tether fatigue and consequently it can last longer.  \n\nThe carbon fibre is much more expensive per kilogram (in the order of 90-100\u20ac/kg) than steel or fibre \n\nglass (in the order of 2-5\u20ac/kg) [46] which are the typical materials used in the construction of wind \n\nturbines. However, when comparing these two kind of technologies to harness wind energy, it\u2019s \n\nnecessary to consider that they have a proportion of 1 to 260 tonnes but also have different nominal \n\npowers of 0.6 and 2 MW [47]. All these factors need to be taken into account when looking to the capital \n\ncost (CapEx) which allied with the OpExt gives the total cost of the technology over its lifetime. The \n\ndivision of this cost by the value of all energy produced over its lifetime gives the levelized cost of \n\nenergy (equation 1.2), that as it was previously mentioned, is one important parameter to predict if it's \n\nworth investing in this technology. \n\nNowadays, onshore wind power LCOE\u2019s could round the 0.05/kWh [48], and Makani claim that his \n\nprototype can reach a competitive value of 0.026 \u20ac/kWh [49], however to be able to prove this value it\u2019s \n\nnecessary to continue the development of the technology towards commercial projects. \n\n  \n\n\n\nTechnical evaluation and modelling of a cross wind kite based on Loyd\u2019s model \n\n \n\n \n\n40 \n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\n[1] G.
