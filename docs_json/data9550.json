Nas \u00faltimas decadas, investiga\u00e7\u00e3o na \u00e1rea \n\nde viroterapia mediada por ultrassons focalizados, na presen\u00e7a de agentes de contraste, \n\ndesignados por \u2018micro bolhas\u2019, provou que este tratamento poderia ser uma boa \n\nalternativa para o tratamento de tumores. As terapias em estudo incluem estrat\u00e9gias tais \n\ncomo o recurso a v\u00edrus oncol\u00edticos que t\u00eam afinidade para tecidos inflamados e que por \n\nactiva\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema imunit\u00e1rio causam a sua destrui\u00e7\u00e3o \u2013 estes v\u00edrus s\u00e3o conhecidos em \n\nviroterapia como \u2018v\u00edrus suicidas\u2019.  \n\n Aplica\u00e7\u00f5es com v\u00edrus oncol\u00edticos encontram no processo de sonopora\u00e7\u00e3o uma \n\nforma de aumentar/facilitar a entrada de conte\u00fado viral para o interior das c\u00e9lulas \n\ncancer\u00edgenas mas existem ainda muitos problemas a ultrapassar em termos de efici\u00eancia \n\ne seguran\u00e7a para que estes tratamentos possam ser utilizados em meio cl\u00ednico. A \n\ntoxicidade da \u2018terapia viral\u2019 \u00e9 um dos maiores problemas associados e com o intuito de \n\nminimizar este problema, foi desenvolvida uma nova t\u00e9cnica designada por \u2018Isolated \n\nLimb Perfusion\u2019 (ILP). Esta t\u00e9cnica tem por base o isolamento de vasos sangu\u00edneos que \n\nirrigam a regi\u00e3o do tumor, normalmente aplicada nos membros superiores ou inferiores, \n\nisolando o membro da circula\u00e7\u00e3o sist\u00e9mica atrav\u00e9s de um torniquete. A t\u00e9cnica ILP vai \n\nser usada neste projecto em ratos da linhagem Brown Norwegian, nos quais ser\u00e3o \n\nimplantadas c\u00e9lulas cancer\u00edgenas (linha de c\u00e9lulas de fibrosarcoma BN175) nos membros \n\ninferiores. \n\n Um fibrosarcoma/sarcoma \u00e9 um tumor maligno dos tecidos moles que \n\nnormalmente se desenvolve nos membros inferiores. Os tratamentos para este tipo de \n\ncancro incluem uma cirurgia extremamente invasiva com possibilidade de remo\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n4 \n\nmembro para garantir a sobreviv\u00eancia do doente e que \u00e9 normalmente combinada com \n\nradioterapia.  \n\n Posto isto, \u00e9 muito importante que se promova a investiga\u00e7\u00e3o neste tipo de terapias \n\nde forma a tornar os tratamentos menos invasivos. Com este objectivo, este projecto \u00e9 um \n\nestudo piloto com fundamento num estudo de Pencavel et al., com o t\u00edtulo \u201cIsolated limb \n\nperfusion with melphalan, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and oncolytic vaccinia virus \n\nimproves tumour targeting and prolongs survival in a rat model of advanced extremity \n\nsarcoma\u201d, publicado em 2015 em International Journal of Cancer. Assim, o prop\u00f3sito \n\ndeste estudo \u00e9 adicionar \u2018ultrassons focalizados\u2019 a esta terapia combinada para verificar \n\nse i) h\u00e1 um aumento da entrada e replica\u00e7\u00e3o do v\u00edrus de forma a aumentar a efici\u00eancia do \n\ntratamento e ii) se existe a possibilidade de evitar o uso de um factor de necrose tumoral \n\n(TNF-?) para reduzir a toxicidade do tratamento. Este factor, pretence a um grupo de \n\ncitocinas capaz de provocar a morte de c\u00e9lulas tumorais e que possuem uma vasta gama \n\nde ac\u00e7\u00f5es pr\u00f3-inflamat\u00f3rias sendo altamente t\u00f3xico quando em circula\u00e7\u00e3o sist\u00e9mica. \n\n A distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de v\u00edrus mediada por ultrassons oferece uma oportunidade para a \n\nrealiza\u00e7\u00e3o de terapia direccionada n\u00e3o-invasiva em \u00f3rg\u00e3os internos espec\u00edficos. Para isto, \n\na sonopora\u00e7\u00e3o envolve o uso de micro bolhas que s\u00e3o injectadas na corrente sangu\u00ednea \n\nem conjunto com os restantes agentes qu\u00edmicos e os v\u00edrus. Quando estas micro bolhas s\u00e3o \n\nexpostas aos feixes de ultrassons focalizados, a uma dada frequ\u00eancia, estas expandem-se \n\ne contraem com rapidez. Se as micro bolhas estiverem pr\u00f3ximas de uma membrana \n\ncelular, a sua deforma\u00e7\u00e3o ou fragmenta\u00e7\u00e3o f\u00edsica aumenta a porosidade da membrana \n\ncelular. O mecanismo exacto envolvido ainda n\u00e3o \u00e9 completamente compreendido, mas \n\n\u00e9 associado a cavita\u00e7\u00e3o ac\u00fastica que pode ser est\u00e1vel ou inst\u00e1vel. A cavita\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1vel \n\nocorre quando as bolhas oscilam por sucessivas compress\u00f5es e descompress\u00f5es mas \n\npermanecem intactas. Por outro lado, a cavita\u00e7\u00e3o inst\u00e1vel ocorre quando s\u00e3o usadas \n\namplitudes de alta press\u00e3o, conduzindo ao colapso das bolhas. \n\n Os principais objectivos deste projecto piloto s\u00e3o estudar a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o do v\u00edrus \n\nnos tumores e quantificar o n\u00famero de particulas virais com capacidade de se replicarem. \n\nIsto \u00e9 conseguido atrav\u00e9s de ensaios qu\u00edmicos como qPCR (quantitative real-time \n\nPolymerase Chain Reaction), Plaque Assay (para quantificar a presen\u00e7a de v\u00edrus) e \n\nImunofluoresc\u00eancia. Este processo vai incluir experi\u00eancias in vitro com a linha de c\u00e9lulas \n\nBN175, inicialmente para testar o efeito da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de (i) ultrassons focalizados (ii) \n\nmicro bolhas e (iii) ultrassons focalizados e micro bolhas.  \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n5 \n\n As experi\u00eancias in vitro v\u00e3o incluir o estudo do efeito de diferentes par\u00e2metros \n\nf\u00edsicos tais como: o valor de press\u00e3o in situ causado pela propaga\u00e7\u00e3o da onda de som; a \n\nquantidade de tempo em que os ultrassons s\u00e3o emitidos durante um determinado tempo \n\nde exposi\u00e7\u00e3o (Duty Cycle); a frequ\u00eancia de repeti\u00e7\u00e3o do pulso de ultrassom; o tempo de \n\nexposi\u00e7\u00e3o e a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de micro bolhas na solu\u00e7\u00e3o a ser testada. O objectivo da \n\nvaria\u00e7\u00e3o destes par\u00e2metros, que \u00e9 feita com base na literatura, tem como objectivo \n\npromover a cavita\u00e7\u00e3o inst\u00e1vel e ao mesmo tempo evitar que isto cause a morte das c\u00e9lulas \n\ncancer\u00edgenas para garantir que os v\u00edrus poder\u00e3o vir a atravessar a membrana de c\u00e9lulas \n\nvi\u00e1veis. A partir dos resultados encontrados atrav\u00e9s das experi\u00eancias in vitro, ser\u00e3o \n\nescolhidos os melhores par\u00e2metros a utilizar in vivo para determinar se uma terapia que \n\ncombina ultrassons focalizados,  Melphalan, TNF-? e V\u00edrus da Var\u00edola (geneticamente \n\nmodicado para uma \u2018vers\u00e3o\u2019 menos infecciosa) ser\u00e1 uma potencial forma de \n\ntratamento/cura de tumores, de forma menos invasiva. \n\n Para realizar as experi\u00eancias in vitro, foi realizada uma calibra\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\nequipamentos a utilizar, nomeadamente dos transdutores, para garantir que todos os \n\n\u2018outputs\u2019 s\u00e3o conhecidos (com uma incerteza de 10% associada). Al\u00e9m disto, foi \n\nrealizado um estudo para perceber quais s\u00e3o os valores de press\u00e3o que favorecem a \n\ncavita\u00e7\u00e3o inercial para poder associar os resultados \u00e0 presen\u00e7a ou aus\u00eancia de cavita\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ninercial, de acordo com os par\u00e2metros utilizados. Os testes in vitro mostraram que valores \n\nde press\u00e3o superiores a 0.9 MPa, para valores fixos de frequ\u00eancia de repeti\u00e7\u00e3o do pulso \n\nde 100 Hz, um feixe com 40 ciclos e uma exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de 0.5 s, reduzem a viabilidade das \n\nc\u00e9lulas em cerca de 80%. A varia\u00e7\u00e3o dos restantes par\u00e2metros parece n\u00e3o ter muita \n\ninflu\u00eancia a n\u00edvel da viabilidade celular. Os resultados in vivo n\u00e3o permitem concluir \n\nacerca do aumento da efici\u00eancia do tratamento pois os n\u00edveis de press\u00e3o in situ utilizados \n\nparecem ser nocivos ou para as part\u00edculas virais ou para as c\u00e9lulas \u2013 mais experi\u00eancias \n\nser\u00e3o necess\u00e1rias para tirar conclus\u00f5es in vivo. \n\n \n\nPalavras-Chave: Sonopora\u00e7\u00e3o, Viroterapia, V\u00edrus Oncol\u00edticos, Cavita\u00e7\u00e3o Ac\u00fastica, \n\nUltrassons Focalizados, Isolated Limb Perfusion, BN175, Ratos Brown Norwegian \n\n  \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n6 \n\n \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\n \n \n\n The phenomenon by which ultrasound may transiently alter the structure of the \n\ncellular membrane, and thus allowing enhanced uptake of low and high molecular weight \n\nmolecules into the cell is defined as Sonoporation. In gene therapy, the main goal is to \n\nincrease the delivery efficiency of exogenous nucleic acid to a site-specific target. For \n\ngene transfer using sonoporation, the biophysical effects involved include cavitation, \n\nradiation pressure, and microstreaming - the shear forces present near the microbubbles. \n\nThe acoustic pressures required to destroy microbubbles lie in the diagnostic range, and \n\nif these are too high or last too long, undesirable levels of cell killing will occur, resulting \n\nin poor DNA transfer.  \n\n There is the need to develop a new treatment for a soft tissue tumor defined as \n\nfibrosarcoma which is a malignant tumor that usually develops in the legs and whose \n\ntreatment involves a wide excision, usually combined with radiation therapy. This project \n\nis a pilot study in which Focused Ultrasound and Microbubbles is added to a combined \n\ntherapy including Melphalan, TNF-? and Vaccinia Virus to try to enhance the efficacy \n\nand reduce the toxicity of the treatment. The main goals of this pilot project are to study \n\ntumor virus distribution and then to quantify the number of viral particles in the tumors \n\nusing appropriate assays (e.g. qPCR, Plaque Assay, Immunofluorescence). This involves \n\nin vitro experiments with BN175 rat sarcoma line, initially to test a combination therapy \n\nwith the virus in the presence or absence of (i) focused ultrasound (ii) microbubble and \n\n(iii) focused ultrasound and microbubbles.  \n\n The physical parameters to be optimised are peak rarefactional focal pressures, \n\nduty cycle, pulse repetition frequency, exposure duration and microbubble concentration. \n\n In vitro results suggest that once inertial cavitation starts, the viability of BN175 \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n7 \n\ncells decreases and this effect is higher in the presence of microbubbles. In vivo \n\nexperiments in Brown Norwegian rats should help to determine the effectiveness of the \n\ncombined therapy using Focused Ultrasound in the presence of Microbubbles, Melphalan, \n\nTNF-? and Vaccinia Virus using the technique of Isolated Limb Perfusion but the results \n\nsuggest that the use of Focused Ultrasound and Microbubbles might be killing the virus. \n\nAlthough, the results from qPCR analysis and viral plaque assays are not enough to \n\nconfirm this theory and the histochemical analysis failed. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Sonoporation, Virotherapy, Oncolytic Viruses, Cavitation, Focused \n\nUltrasound, Isolated Limb Perfusion, BN175 cell line, Brown Norwegian rats  \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n8 \n\n \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\n \n \n The last five years of my life have been full of moments of learning \u2013 learning \n\nabout life, learning about people, learning about me.

Introduction \n \n\n \n\n  Chapter by Chapter Overview \n \n\n \n\n1.1.1. Chapter 1 \u2013 Introduction to Transducers Calibration \n\n \n\n The Introductory part of this thesis is divided in sections such as i) \u201cMotivation \n\nand Background\u201d, in which there is a brief description of the main concepts and of the \n\nproject itself, ii) Hypothesis and Thesis Aim\u201d, where the hypothesis is that Focused \n\nUltraSound (FUS) in the presence of MicroBubbles (MB) enhances the activity of \n\noncolytic virotherapy delivered during Isolated Limb Perfusion (ILP) through several \n\nmechanisms which include direct anti-tumour activity and enhancement of the activity of \n\nmelphalan/TNF-? and increased intratumoural delivery of oncolytic viruses. For this, the \n\nFUS fields to be used will be characterised using well established techniques. In vivo \n\nexperiments will be made in Brown Norwegian Rats implanted with fibrosarcoma cells \n\n(BN175 cell line) and then an overview on, iii) Virotherapy for Cancer, iv) Focused \n\nUltrasound in Cancer Therapies, v) Basic Principles of FUS, vi) Cellular interaction \n\nmechanisms in therapies using Focused Ultrasound which will help to clarify the main \n\nconcepts used along this dissertation. Finally, vii) the state of the art of combined \n\ntreatments using drugs/virus and focused ultrasound that describes the last decade studies \n\non the area of oncolytic virotherapy combined with FUS. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.1.2. Chapter 2 \u2013 Calibration of a Focused Ultrasound Transducer \n\nand Measurement of Cavitation Thresholds under Different \n\nFrequencies \n\n \n\n This chapter is divided into two main sections. The first section describes the \n\nultrasound beam, its propagation and the processes involved in Transducers Calibration. \n\nThere are three sub-sections for Transducers Calibration: an introduction, then the \n\nmethodology used and finally the results. The second part of this chapter has to do with \n\nthe Measurement of Cavitation Thresholds at three different drive frequencies. A Brief \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n29 \n\nReview on the topic is the first sub-section and this is followed by the description of the \n\nMethods and then the Results which are presented paired with the Discussion of the \n\nResults. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.1.3. Chapter 3 - In Vitro Study on the Effects of Focused Ultrasound \n\non BN175 Sarcoma Cell Line \n\n \n\n This chapter focuses on the potential of ultrasound and microbubbles to enhance \n\ndrug delivery by the process of Sonoporation, i.e. the formation of temporary pores in the \n\ncell membrane, as well as enhanced Endocytosis that have been reported as the main \n\nbiological mechanisms involved. In general, the uptake of drugs or small molecules is \n\nattributed to ultrasound mediated transient permeabilization of the cell membrane. This \n\ntransient permeabilization can occur due to stable and inertial cavitation events in the \n\npresence or absence of artificial microbubbles. To confirm this, physical parameters of \n\nultrasound such as Peak Negative Pressure (PNP), Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF), \n\nDuty Cycle (DC) and Duration of Exposure (DE) have been tested at different levels to \n\nsee how this could affect the fibrosarcoma cell line. The Methodoly used is described and \n\na Discussion of the Results helps to take some conclusions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.1.4. Chapter 4 - In Vivo Study on the Development of a Combined \n\nTreatment for Cancer using Virus and Focused Ultrasound \n\n \n\n The toxicity of viral therapy is a concern and to minimize it, a novel technique \n\nknown as Isolation Limb Perfusion has been developed. This is a chemotherapeutic \n\ntechnique using melphalan, Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-?), oncolytic vaccinia \n\nvirus and involving the cannulation of the blood vessels feeding the tumour-bearing \n\nregion and isolation of the limb from the systemic circulation by tourniquet mainly due \n\nto the severe toxicity of TNF-?. ILP is used in this project, which aims to study the \n\ncombination of ILP and FUS in the presence of microbubbles to increase viral penetration \n\nof tumour bulk in Brown Norwegian rats transfected with BN175 fibrosarcoma cells. The \n\nin vivo work is described in Chapter 4 and this includes a short introduction, the \n\ndescription of methods and then the presentation of the results and its discussion.  \n\n1.1.5. Chapter 5 - Conclusions and Future Work \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n30 \n\n \n\n This chapter helps to summarize all the conclusions from the experiments of this \n\npilot project but also, contains some important suggestions on what could have been done \n\nbetter and what could be done in the future. \n\n \n\n \n\n  Motivation and Background \n \n\n Sonoporation is a process by which the permeability of a membrane is changed. \n\nThis alteration in the membrane generates a passage through which small molecules can \n\nenter. During the last decades, research on focused ultrasound and microbubble mediated \n\nvirotherapy has been carried out and proved to be a good approach to cancer treatment. \n\nThe treatments under research include strategies such as viral transduction of tumour cells \n\nwith \u2018suicide genes\u2019, using viral infection to trigger immune-mediated tumour cell death \n\nand using oncolytic viruses for their direct anti-tumour action.  \n\n For oncolytic viruses, sonoporation seems to be important to get increased viral \n\nuptake in cells but the safety and efficiency of the overall process needs to be studied for \n\nclinical use. The toxicity of viral therapy is a concern and to minimize it, a novel technique \n\nknown as Isolated Limb Perfusion has been developed. This is a chemotherapeutic \n\ntechnique involving the cannulation of the blood vessels feeding the tumour-bearing \n\nregion and isolation of the limb from the systemic circulation by tourniquet. ILP will be \n\nused in this project in Brown Norwegian rats transfected with BN175 Fibrosarcoma cells. \n\n A Fibrosarcoma is malignant soft tissue tumor or sarcoma that usually grows in \n\nthe lower extremities of the human body. Treatment for a fibrosarcoma involves a wide \n\nexcision, usually combined with radiation therapy. In severe cases of fibrosarcoma, it \n\nmight be necessary to remove the entire limb to guarantee the survival of the patient.  \n\n Research must be done to diminish the invasiveness of tumor therapies. This \n\nproject is a pilot study based on a study of Pencavel et al. which is entitled as \u201cIsolated \n\nlimb perfusion with melphalan, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and oncolytic vaccinia virus \n\nimproves tumour targeting and prolongs survival in a rat model of advanced extremity \n\nsarcoma\u201d that was published in 2015 in the International Journal of Cancer. So, the aim \n\nis to add Focused Ultrasound to this combined therapy to see i) if there is an increased \n\nuptake and replication of virus for enhanced efficacy of the treatment and ii) if there is a \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n31 \n\npossibility to avoid the use of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, which is toxic when in the \n\nsystemic circulation, to reduce the invasiveness of the treatment. \n\n The main goals of this pilot project are to study tumor virus distribution and then \n\nto quantify the number of viral particles in the tumors using appropriate assays (e.g. \n\nqPCR, Plaque Assay, Immunofluorescence). This will involve in vitro experiments with \n\nthe BN175 rat sarcoma line, initially to test a combination therapy with the virus in the \n\npresence or absence of (i) focused ultrasound (ii) microbubble and (iii) focused ultrasound \n\nand microbubbles.  \n\n The physical parameters to be optimised are peak negative pressures, duty cycle, \n\npulse repetition frequency, exposure duration and microbubble concentration. Once a \n\nrange of optimal parameters has been found, these will be applied in in vivo Brown \n\nNorwegian rats in order to determine if a combined therapy using Focused Ultrasound, \n\nMelphalan, TNF-? and Vaccinia Virus using the technique of ILP. TNF-? is a cell \n\nsignaling protein (cytokine) involved in systemic inflammation that is also capable of \n\ninduce fever, apoptotic cell death, and inhibit tumorigenesis and viral replication. This \n\nmolecule is mortal in the concentration it is used in this therapy so it will also be studied \n\nthe possibility to avoid this chemotherapeutic agent to reduce the toxicity of the treatment. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Contributions \n \n\n The hypothesis to be tested was that Focused Ultrasound in the presence of \n\nmicrobubbles enhances the efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy delivered during Isolated \n\nLimb Perfusion through several mechanisms, which include direct anti-tumour activity, \n\nenhancement of the activity of melphalan/TNF-alpha, and increased intratumoural \n\ndelivery of oncolytic viruses.  \n\n The following specific research aims were addressed: \n\n \n\n1. Characterisation (in vitro and in vivo) of the effects of FUS and MB on standard \n\nILP with melphalan/TNF-alpha in rat distal limb sarcoma.  \n\n2. Evaluation of FUS + MB over a range of ultrasound intensities as a means of \n\nenhancing intratumoural delivery of oncolytic virotherapy during ILP. These \n\nstudies included the evaluation of viral biodistribution using viral plaque assays, \n\nquantitative PCR, analysis of gene expression and non-invasive imaging \n\n(bioluminescent and GFP/RFP imaging), \u2013 characterisation of the effects of \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n32 \n\ntherapeutic FUS + MB with ILP-delivered oncolytic virotherapy. These studies \n\ninvolved the evaluation of the effects of treatment schedule and dose and included \n\nin vivo (direct measurement, imaging analysis). \n\n \n\n The FUS fields used were characterised using well established techniques and the \n\nultrasound parameters investigated were peak negative pressures, duty cycle, Pulse \n\nrepetition frequency, and duration of exposure. These parameters were varied with the \n\naim of identifying the conditions that gave the optimal viability for the sarcoma cell line \n\nused (BN175 cell line).  These were investigated in combination with commercially \n\navailable ultrasound contrast agents (i.e. MB) in an attempt to find the most effective \n\nexposure.  The mechanisms for any observed effects were studied.  Ultrasonic cavitation \n\nwas monitored, and its influence investigated. \n\n The therapeutic efficacy of FUS/MB-assisted oncolytic virotherapy during ILP, \n\nthis was tested in immunocompetent brown Norwegian rats bearing BN175 syngeneic \n\ntumours.  These models allowed evaluation of effects of the combination therapy on \n\nlocoregional control. \n\n \n\n Virotherapy for Cancer \n \n\n The possibility of treating the underlying causes instead of solely its symptoms, \n\nand thus eliminating disease, is getting closer and closer to reality when we talk about \n\ncancer. Research is being undertaken in the field of viral based gene delivery systems and \n\nhas already proved to be useful for the treatment of some tumors [1-4].  \n\n Over the last century, clinicians have already used a spectrum of wild-type viruses \n\nto treat cancer patients. However this approach was temporarily abandoned not only due \n\nto adverse biological effects of the virus and to safety of both patients and staff, but also \n\nbecause of enthusiasm for the advent of chemotherapy [5]. Over the past decade, research \n\nin this field has once again been taking place, with several viruses having been evaluated.  \n\nGenetic engineering of viruses to target cancers safely is now a few steps away from \n\nworldwide clinical application - the first agent is about to be approved for use as a novel \n\ncancer therapy modality [6, 7]. \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n33 \n\n The use of oncolytic viruses in oncology is called virotherapy, and nowadays is \n\none of the most promising cancer therapy methods. Viral-mediated gene delivery systems \n\nconsist of site-specific delivery of viruses which are modified to be replication-deficient \n\noutside the target tissue, but which can deliver DNA for expression. In this context, \n\nviruses can be used as anti-cancer agents which attack malignant cells, while healthy cells \n\nremain relatively undamaged. Different kinds of viral vector systems are used, including \n\nretrovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, herpes simpex virus or lentivirus [8]. As \n\nwell as having an anti-cancer effect, oncolytic viruses are also capable of inducing an \n\nanti-tumour immune response \u2013 immunotherapy \u2013 which is thought to help in eliminating \n\nresidual cancer cells or in maintaining micrometastases in a state of dormancy [9]. \n\n Adenoviral vectors are the most promising and widely used platform for gene \n\ntherapy and virotherapy. However, there have been problems associated with their use \n\n[10]. The major challenges in adenovirus-mediated cancer gene therapy and virotherapy \n\nare poor transduction in human tumors, and the existence of immune responses against \n\nthe adenovirus that drastically limit the vector transduction efficiency and the duration of \n\ntransgene expression [11]. In order to avoid these problems, several strategies have been \n\nproposed, these include the modification of the viral particles to provide increased affinity \n\nto tumor receptors, and to facilitate binding and replication, and the use of \n\nimmunosuppressive agents to eliminate a possible anti-viral immune response [10-12]. \n\nOthers goals, which focus on treatment efficacy, are to obtain specificity to cancer cells \n\n(in order to avoid damaging normal cells), and improvement in the means of inducing cell \n\ndeath by modifying viral proteins to destroy cancer cells by promotion of viral replication \n\nin malignant cells but not in normal cells, thus enabling the targeting of metastastic cancer \n\ncells. A third goal in terms of efficiency is to improve transduction \u2013 the delivery of \n\ntherapeutic genes into cancer cells. The overall efficacy of the treatment of tumors with \n\nviral particles can also be enhanced if combined with methods that help to open the \n\nmembranes of cancer cells [11, 12]. \n\n There are tumor specific viral vectors which are equipped with an efficient \n\ndelivery system, and are ready for immediate use in in vivo mouse models, and for testing \n\nin clinical trials, but still can not be used to treat patients on a regular basis. The therapy \n\nmost used to treat tumours is chemotherapy. It helps to shrink tumors but this is usually \n\nreversible \u2013 the tumors can grow again and become resistant to the treatment. This \n\nresistance can be reduced if chemotherapy is combined with other treatments which rely \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n34 \n\non different mechanisms for attacking and killing cancerous cells. The main problem of \n\ncombined therapies is the toxicity \u2013 it must be reduced as much as possible - and special \n\nattention to other possible safety issues such as environmental shedding, mutation and \n\nreversion to wildtype virus is necessary [7]. \n\n One novel cancer therapy technique under investigation is Isolated Limb \n\nPerfusion using melphalan, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and oncolytic vaccinia virus. \n\nImproved tumour targeting has been reported by Pencavel et al [13]in terms of \n\ntransduction route and prolonged survival in a rat model with advanced extremity \n\nsarcoma . Standard in vitro assays were used to characterise the single and combined \n\neffect of melphalan, Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-?) and Lister strain vaccinia \n\nvirus (GLV-1h68), which is an attenuated recombinant vaccinia virus (VACV) that \n\nselectively colonizes established human xenografts, thus inducing their complete \n\nregression, in BN175 rat sarcoma cells. An orthotopic model of advanced extremity \n\nsarcoma (a model in which the tumor is localised in the place in the body where it belongs) \n\nwas used to evaluate the survival of animals after receiving ILP with this triple Melphalan, \n\nTNF-? and Vaccinia Virus therapy . Successful pre-clinical results, in terms of reduced \n\ntumor growth and increased rat survival, have highlighted the need to develop a treatment \n\nwith increased viral uptake in which invasiveness can be reduced, and where post-\n\ntreatment surgery is not needed. In addressing this goal, this project focuses on the study \n\nof the combination of ILP and FUS in the presence of microbubbles to increase viral \n\npenetration efficiency of tumour bulk in Brown Norwegian rats transfected with BN175 \n\nfibrosarcoma cells. \n\n \n\n  Focused Ultrasound in Cancer Therapies \n \n\n A method of improving the specificity and efficiency of any treatment is crucially \n\nneeded.  The difficulty of getting molecules across membranes to reach the cell nucleus, \n\nfor tumour treatment, may potentially be overcome using Focused Ultrasound. It can be \n\nused to facilitate the transport of molecules into cells by altering their membrane \n\npermeability. \n\n Therapeutic ultrasound is a continuously expanding field and new clinical \n\napplications are constantly being developed. The term \u2018Ultrasound\u2019 (US) is used to \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n35 \n\ndescribe sound waves with frequency above the upper limit of the human hearing range \n\n(>20 kHz). Applications of medical ultrasound can be divided into focused and unfocused \n\ntherapies with devices operating at frequencies from 20 kHz to 5MHz [14, 15]. The \n\nenergy produced by these devices propagates in soft tissue as longitudinal pressure waves, \n\ninteracting with tissue through reflection, scatter and absorption [16, 17]. \n\n Major advances have been made in some fields of medical US and one of major \n\ninterest is Focused Ultrasound surgery. In clinical focused ultrasound treatments, US \n\nenergy of frequencies in the range 0.5 \u2013 5 MHz is concentrated into a focal spot of \n\nmillimetric dimensions. The biophysical effects of ultrasound are traditionally separated \n\ninto those of thermal and non-thermal (acoustic streaming and acoustic cavitation) origin \n\n[18, 19]. However, it may not be completely correct to assume that there is no rise in \n\ntemperature when considering non-thermal effects, because the interaction between tissue \n\nand ultrasound usually results in energy absorption, and therefore a temperature rise [18]. \n\nConversely, acoustic fields which aim to cause heating can also give rise to non-thermal \n\neffects. \n\n Non-thermal mechanisms include: Acoustic Streaming which arises from the loss \n\nof momentum when the ultrasound hits a target, and provides a driving force capable of \n\ndisplacing ions and small molecules; Acoustic cavitation, defined as the interaction \n\nbetween sound waves and microscopic gas bubbles within a fluid. The compression and \n\nrarefaction present in the ultrasound field lead to bubble compression and expansion [20].  \n\n Focused ultrasound can be used to enhance the ability of a virus to infect cells \n\nupon arrival at a target, in part, because of the increased blood flow which is the body\u2019s \n\nbiological response to the temperature rise at the focus, but mainly because it can cause a \n\ntemporary change in cell membrane permeability.  Acoustic Cavitation plays an important \n\nrole in this process. \n\n \n\n1.5.1. Acoustic Cavitation \n \n\n Acoustic cavitation helps to concentrate acoustic energy into small volumes. \n\nInertial cavitation can lead to a local rise in temperature of thousands of kelvin, pressures \n\nof GPa, high local accelerations and shockwaves. Acoustic cavitation thus constitutes a \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n36 \n\ncomplex multidisciplinary problem, involving a wide range of temporal and spatial \n\nscales, and is difficult to measure, control, predict, and to scale up. \n\n Two types of acoustic cavitation are defined: stable and inertial. Stable cavitation \n\noccurs when a bubble oscillates steadily in an ultrasonic field, intercepting and re-\n\nradiating energy to the surrounding tissue, causing microstreaming, which can, in turn, \n\nleads to shear stresses which can damage cells.  This form of cavitation is characterised \n\nby the emission of harmonics and ultra-harmonics of the drive frequency, which can be \n\nmonitored. Above a certain pressure amplitude threshold, oscillation becomes non-linear \n\nand the bubbles expand and collapse vigorously resulting in localised acoustic pressures \n\nof several thousand atmospheres that cause damage to cells in their immediate vicinity- \n\nthis is known as inertial cavitation and is characterized by broadband acoustic emissions \n\nin addition to the harmonics and ultraharmonics of stable cavitation.  \n\n Inertial cavitation occurring near a cell boundary can cause transient membrane \n\nrupture due to shock waves and jetting during microbubble collapse [21]. This effect, also \n\nknown as \u201csonoporation\u201d , is thought to be a major contributor towards improving \n\nintracellular drug and gene delivery [22, 23] \u2013 see Figure 1.1. Sonoporation is of special \n\ninterest due to its non-invasive nature, and its potential for treating tissues located several \n\ncentimetres deep within the body.   \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1. Schematic of the Focused Ultrasound  - mediated viral particles delivery by sonoporation \n\n  \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n37 \n\n An ultrasound exposure may be carried out on its own [24] or in the presence of \n\ngas microbubbles [25]. Microbubbles are stabilised gas bubbles used to increase scatter \n\nto provide ultrasound imaging contrast, but which can also serve as nuclei for acoustic \n\ncavitation. The gas filling the bubble provides elasticity to the bubble which in turn \n\nopposes the resistance to any compression or expansion imposed by the liquid motion. \n\nThis force may put the liquid into motion, so that the bubble constitutes a mass\u2013spring \n\nsystem [26]. When excited at large amplitudes, the bubble oscillations can exhibit a non-\n\nlinear behaviour.  When the ratio of the linear resonance frequency and the driving \n\nfrequency \u2013 f0/f - approaches a rational number n/m, a non-linear resonance can occur \n\nand the amplitude of the bubble oscillations increases. The 1/1 peak corresponds to the \n\nlinear resonance frequency. Following the accepted terminology, the resonances n/1 are \n\ncalled harmonic, the resonances 1/m are sub-harmonic, while the rational ratio n/m gives \n\nultra-harmonic resonances [26]. \n\n In gene therapy, the combination of gas microbubbles with ultrasound can result \n\nin greater delivery efficiency than when no microbubbles are present [25, 27] and there \n\nare differences in the effects produced in the cells when in high or low in situ ultrasound \n\npressures are used. The probability of cavitation increases with increasing pressure and \n\ndecreasing frequency. This has been extensively investigated with ultrasound contrast \n\nagents and microbubbles have been shown to lower the threshold of cavitation [28]. \n\n \n\n1.5.2. High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Therapy \n \n\n The potential of focused ultrasound to produce localised destruction of deep tissue \n\nstructures has been known since the early 1950s [15]. Focused Ultrasound at intensities \n\nin the range 102\u2013104W/cm2 is known as High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) [29]. \n\nIn medical HIFU treatments, US energy is focused into a millimeter or even a sub \n\nmillimeter sized focal spot to heat and destroy the targeted tissue, while ideally not \n\ndamaging tissue outside the focal region. When the ultrasonic energy absorption in a focal \n\nvolume is sufficient to raise the temperature above 55\u00baC for 1s or longer,  proteins are \n\ndenaturated, causing immediate cell death \u2013 the volume of dead cells being referred to as \n\n\u201clesion\u201d [15, 29]. The two mechanisms believed to be most important for tissue \n\ndestruction are heating and acoustic cavitation [29]. \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n38 \n\n HIFU was first developed for localised tissue destruction in the brain by Fry et al. \n\n[30, 31].  Burov, in 1956 [32], was the first to suggest its use for cancer therapy. Early \n\nuse was made of HIFU in the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease and for a number of \n\nophthalmological problems (including the treatment of glaucoma and retinal tears) [15]. \n\n The possibility of non-invasive targeting of subcutaneous tissue volumes has \n\nmade HIFU a potential substitute for surgery for liver, bladder, prostate and kidney \n\ntumors. Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies worldwide \n\nand hepatic metastases are a common cause of death in cancer patients [14]. This \n\ntechnique may not require surgery, anaesthesia or adjuvant cytotoxic drugs, and thus the \n\nlikely side effects are minimal. \n\n The preceding description of High Intensity Focused Ultrasound indicates that this \n\ntechnique as a powerful tool for fighting malignant cells, but not that it is a means of \n\nenhancing therapeutic efficiency for drug/viral delivery. However, a combination of \n\ndifferents levels of intensity can be used to advantage for this. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.5.3. Low Intensity Focused Ultrasound Therapy \n \n\n Low Intensity Focused Ultrasound is associated with intensities below \n\napproximately 102W/cm2 [29], and its main applications are in bone healing, \n\nsonothrombolysis, ultrasonic enhancement of drug uptake by sonophoresis and \n\nsonoporation and gene therapy [15]. \n\n The way in which bone repair may be accelerated by ultrasound is still not fully \n\nunderstood. Mechanisms that have been proposed are signal transduction, enhancement \n\nof gene expression, blood flow changes, tissue modelling effects or micro-mechanical \n\nstresses. In sonothrombolysis, the dissolution of blood clots is mediated by ultrasound, \n\nboth in the absence and in the presence of microbubbles, and the responsible mechanisms \n\nare suggested to be acoustic cavitation, streaming, and mechanical interaction that affect \n\nthe fibrin mesh, thus allowing disruption and better access for drugs [15].  \n\n The applications of most interest for this project are the ultrasonic enhancement \n\nof drug uptake and gene therapy, although this is an area of study that is still poorly \n\nunderstood. Sonoporation and gene therapy have similarities since both involve an \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n39 \n\nalteration in membranes to facilitate the entrance of therapeutic vectors. Sonoporation is \n\nthe term used for the phenomenon by which ultrasound may transiently alter the structure \n\nof the cellular membrane, and thus allowing enhanced uptake of low and high molecular \n\nweight molecules into the cell. In gene therapy the main goal is to increase the delivery \n\nefficiency of exogenous nucleic acid to a site-specific target \u2013 the main vehicles being \n\nstudied are viral and non-viral vectors. [15]. \n\n For gene transfer using sonoporation, the biophysical effects involved include \n\ncavitation, radiation pressure, and microstreaming - the shear forces present near the \n\nmicrobubbles. [16]. The acoustic pressures required to destroy microbubbles lie in the \n\ndiagnostic range, and if these are too high or last too long, undesirable levels of cell killing \n\nwill occur, resulting in poor DNA transfer [34]. \n\n Microbubbles may be added to the blood circulation to aid drug delivery.  These \n\nlower the threshold for acoustic cavitation and can also be manipulated to be drug carriers. \n\n It is possible to encapsulate drugs within the bubbles, they may be incorporated \n\neither into the shell or inside it in some way, for example using ligands embedded into \n\nthe lipid membrane. It is also possible to construct microbubbles with a multilayered shell \n\ncontaining drug [15, 23, 25]. The loaded microbubbles, can be metabolized and \n\naccumulated within the target volume. Low intensity ultrasound can then destroy them \n\nlocally, releasing the drug. The spatial localisation relies on the ability to confine the \n\nultrasound beam to the required target volume [15].  \n\n There are allways bio-effects associated with ultrasound, but their significance \n\ndepends on the intensity and duration of the exposure. At low intensities, any effect seen \n\nis likely to be reversible and/or beneficial. On the other hand, at high intensities it is \n\npossible to destroy tissue by protein denaturation, and this may be really useful in \n\noncology [15]. The diagnostic and therapeutic ability of ultrasound turns it into a very \n\ninteresting tool for research and optimisation in the medical field.  \n\n \n\n \n\n  Basic Principles of Focused Ultrasound \n \n\n Ultrasound is known for its routine use in imaging, and research in this area \n\nallowed the discovery of powerful potential for therapeutic applications. A range of \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n40 \n\nbiological effects can be induced by ultrasound, each depending on a wide variety of \n\nphysical parameters that may be varied. \n\n Focused Ultrasound is gaining rapid clinical acceptance as a treatment modality \n\nwhich enables non-invasive tissue heating and ablation for numerous applications.  One \n\nof the greatest advantages of this technique is the possibility of non-invasivetargeting the \n\nultrasound focus deep in the tissue . Focused beams can be used at high power, with the \n\nsource placed either outside the body (for treatment of tumours of, for example, the \n\nabdomen, breast, uterus, and bone, either for surgery or for enhanced uptake of \n\ndrugs/virus) or in the rectum (for treatment of the prostate), and are designed to treat \n\nthetarget tissue volume, while leaving tissue in the ultrasound propagation path relatively \n\nunaffected. A brief description of the principles of operation and physics associated with \n\nfocused ultrasound will be addressed in this chapter. \n\n A wave capable of travelling through multiple tissue layers until it reaches the \n\ntarget is produced from an ultrasound transducer. At each tissue interface, part of the \n\nenergy carried by the sound wave will be reflected, with the remaining energy being \n\ntransmitted. The amount of transmission at the interface depends primarily on the \n\ndifference in acoustic impedance, Z (defined as the product of density and speed of sound, \n\nbetween the two tissue layers) [35]. At interfaces where there is little difference in \n\nacoustic properties, the transmission coefficient is close to unity. With the exception of \n\nfat, air and bone, most tissues in the human body have acoustic properties similar to those \n\nof water. Aqueous media are therefore optimal for coupling ultrasound energy from the \n\ntransducer into the body, and reflections at tissue interfaces are generally weak [35]. \n\n Within a tissue layer, an ultrasound beam consists of pressure fluctuations which \n\nresult in frictional heating. Part of the mechanical energy carried by the incident wave is \n\nthus converted into heat by this viscous absorption, which constitutes the primary \n\nmechanism for ultrasound-induced hyperthermia [35, 36]. In an inhomogenous medium, \n\nregions with different acoustic properties will scatter the incident wave in various \n\ndirections, causing a loss of acoustic intensity in the direction of sound propagation. \n\n The loss in incident acoustic energy in a medium is characterised by its attenuation \n\ncoefficient, \u00b5, given by the sum of the absorption coefficient ?? and the scattering \n\ncoefficient ??. Following propagation through a distance x in a medium of attenuation \n\ncoefficient \u00b5, the ultrasound intensity, I, is given by ? = ?0?\n??? where I0 is the incident \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n41 \n\nultrasound intensity at the origin (x=0). For most tissues, the attenuation coefficient is \n\nrelated to the ultrasound frequency, f, by a power law of the form ? = ?? ?  where a and \n\nb are constants specific for each tissue [35].  \n\n It is this dependency of attenuation on frequency that makes ultrasound \n\nparticularly useful to non-invasive therapies, but which causes some significant \n\nchallenges in optimising the overall treatment procedure. Higher ultrasound frequencies \n\ngive a power-dependent increase of both the absorption and attenuation coefficient. This \n\nimplies a trade off between penetration, associated with low frequencies, and absorption, \n\npaired with high frequencies. Therefore, the optimal choice of therapeutic ultrasound \n\nfrequency is application-specific, and represents a compromise between treatment depth \n\nand the desired rate of heating [36].  \n\n When a large-amplitude single-frequency sound wave propagates through a \n\nnonlinear medium there is a leakage of energy from the fundamental frequency into its \n\nhigher harmonics. The extent to which such leakage occurs depends on the amplitude of \n\nthe incident wave, on the nonlinearity of the medium and on the distance travelled by the \n\nwave into the medium. The nonlinear effects become increasingly significant as the depth \n\nof treatment is increased, or if a region of high intensity happens to be coincident with a \n\nlayer of tissue with significantly different acoustic impedance [35]. \n\n Acoustic cavitation, previously discussed in chapter 1.3.1., and classified into \n\nstable and inertial behaviour, depends on the bubble size compared to the linear resonance \n\nsize at the frequency of insonation, the ultrasound exposure parameters, and on the \n\nrelative contribution of vapour and gas pressures to the total pressure inside the bubbles \n\n[35]. The presence of bubbles results in a change in the acoustic impedance of the tissue \n\nvolume, yielding larger reflection coefficients at the boundaries of the cavitating region. \n\nIn any given medium, the relative increase in any of these coefficients will depend \n\nprimarily on the bubble number density, the range of bubble sizes and the type of \n\ncavitation activity being excited [37]. At a given pressure level, the relative contribution \n\nof nonlinear effects and cavitation depends on the threshold pressure at which cavitation \n\noccurs, the tissue temperature and the distance over which ultrasound has propagated \n\n[35]. \n\n Most clinical applications of Focused Ultrasound make use these effects occurring \n\nduring the propagation of ultrasound waves. Negative acoustic pressures (~1 to 5 MPa) \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n42 \n\nand high temperatures caused by HIFU exposures contribute to the formation of gas \n\ncavities.  Cavitation detection can be performed acoustically by detection of \n\nsubharmonics, harmonics, superharmonics or broadband signals emitted, using e.g, a \n\nPassive Cavitation Detector (PCD). It is possible to infer the existence of cavitation by \n\nlooking at the images acquired by the imaging device associated with a FUS system, since \n\nbright spots occurred because of a greater amount of reflected energy. Cavitation can be \n\nquantified in terms of number of events, or by the amount of released energy (in mV) - \n\nsee figure 1.2.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2. Superposition of an illustration of the principle of HIFU (centre), a typical axial HIFU pressure profile \nand a diagrammatic representation of the frequency-content, f, of the HIFU wave (b-d) as it propagates through \ntissue. HIFU delivers energy onto a small region deep within tissue. Thermal necrosis occurs within the focal \nvolume but the surrounding tissues remains unaffected. In (a) the large peak defines the focal region of the \nHIFU transducer, within which thermal damage is expected to occur. Pre-focal peaks are due to pre-focal \nheating in the different tissue layers. In (b), the peak represents, f0, the frequency of the monochromatic wave \ngenerated by the transducer. As this wave travels through a nonlinear medium, superharmonics leakage occurs \n(c) and the energy of these harmonics is rapidly absorbed and converted to heat. Finally, (c) the detection of \ncavitation results in broadband noise emissions that are readily absorbed and converted into heat (ter Haar, \nG., 2007). \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n43 \n\n  Cellular interaction mechanisms on therapies \nusing Focused Ultrasound \n\n \n\n There is a lack of knowledge about the cellular and molecular biological effects \n\nof Focused Ultrasound exposures. The cellular and molecular biology of tissues can be \n\ndramatically altered by mechanical force and stress. As the use of FUS increases in \n\nclinical applications, there is a need for a better understanding of the cellular and \n\nmolecular consequences of depositing this form of energy in tissues, and of how to \n\nharness this non-invasive technique for novel therapies.   \n\n FUS is generally considered to be noninvasive, Some studies have provided some \n\ninsight into the mechanism of action of FUS at sub-cellular and molecular levels. Two \n\ntypes of mechanisms of action are involved in FUS: thermal and mechanical in origin \u2013 \n\nas discussed previously in section 1.4.   \n\n At high intensities, coagulative necrosis is the main mechanism for cell death but \n\nothers, such as apoptosis or cell lysis, may also take place [38]. When there is cell death, \n\none particularly interesting effect is the increase in the systemic immune response due to \n\nexposure by ultrasound. A response to this inflammatory process can result in the increase \n\nof CD3+ and CD4+ cells \u2013 the denditric cells responsible for a systemic immune response \n\n[39].  \n\n In contrast to HIFU, where the biological outcome is typically instant cell death, \n\nlow-intensity ultrasound may induce numerous short- and long-term outcomes that may \n\nbe suppressive or proliferative depending on the acoustic exposure parameters [38, 40]. \n\nTemporary membrane poration may readily be achieved at low intensities (often refered \n\nto as sonoporation), and it has been tipped as an emerging paradigm for drug/gene \n\ndelivery.  \n\n In particular, sonoporated cells have been found to exhibit membrane shrinkage \n\nand intracellular lipid accumulation. Also, compared to normal cells, their DNA synthesis \n\nkinetics were found to be significantly slowed, and the onset of cell-cycle arrest was \n\nevident. In some instances, programmed cell death (i.e. apoptosis) may even take place. \n\nThis highlights the need to refine and optimize sonoporation for drug/gene delivery \n\npurposes in order to maintain cellular viability. On the other hand, this may represent a \n\nway of inducing cell death that is different to HIFU-based thermal ablation [40]. \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n44 \n\n  State of the Art of Combined Treatments using \nDrugs/Virus and Focused Ultrasound \n\n \n\n Viral agents replicate and induce cell death through mechanisms other than \n\napoptosis, e.g. by eliminating cancer stem cells or by being engineered to carry a wide \n\nvariety of transgenes which induce cell death in a number of different ways. These vectors \n\nmay be used safely with other treatment modalities and have a synergistic anti-cancer \n\neffect which can also be achieved through specific immunological reactions [41]. They \n\ncan increase the potency of multi-modality treatment regimes in an amplified site-specific \n\nmanner which can induce additional specific anti-tumour effects, and thus have the \n\npotential to target metastases through immunological strategies [41]. \n\n There have been several approaches to gene or viral ultrasound-facilitated therapy \n\nover the last few decades, as the mechanism by which ultrasound enhances gene delivery \n\nis still not completely understood. Experiments on the effects of ultrasound on in vitro \n\ngene delivery have been extensively used to determine optimal conditions for use when \n\nexposing in vivo. Some of the studies in this field, published over the last ten years, are \n\ndescribed below. \n\n Focused Ultrasound is attractive because of its potential in non-invasive surgery \n\nto provide tumor thermal ablation selectively in the focal volume, leaving surrounding \n\nhealthy tissue unharmed.  The whole process can be guided using ultrasound or magnetic \n\nresonance imaging. Non-thermal effects such as acoustic cavitation must also be \n\nconsidered when talking about focused ultrasound therapy. Lithotripsy was one of the \n\nfirst applications of focused ultrasound to be considered. Here, shock waves are used to \n\nbreak kidney stones into fragments which the body is able to expel through the urinary \n\ntract [42]. In lithotripsy treatment, cavitation is thought to be the explanation for the side \n\neffects, such as haemorrhage, seen in soft tissue. The cavitation threshold has been \n\nestimated to be in the range of 1.5 to 3.5 MPa when treating human tissue with 0.2 MHz \n\npulsed ultrasound [43]. Cavitation thresholds are thought to be higher in vivo because \n\ntissues and blood circulation in the path traveled by the ultrasound beam cause increased \n\nsound absorption or scattering [44]. Ways of enhancing cavitation in vivo [45] and in vitro \n\n[46] by introducing gas bubbles have been studied, and have led to the identification of \n\nthe process of sonoporation which, when combined with shock wave ablation of tumors \n\nhas resulted in DNA transfer [45, 47-49]. However, the use of lithotripsy to achieve DNA \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n45 \n\ntransfer proved to be unsafe due to the potential for enhanced metastasis of malignant \n\ntumors. Lithotripter shockwaves can enhance metastasis from tumors, and this effect is \n\nattributable to the cavitation mechanism [50, 51]. \n\n The drawbacks of lithotripsy for cancer therapy needed overcoming, and so FUS \n\nstarted to be considered as a less harmful technique, which has the same objectives, since \n\nit provides a means of easily adjusting parameters to promote either thermal or non-\n\nthermal effects. These parameters include transducer frequency, exposure duration, pulse \n\nlength, peak negative pressures in the focal volume, duty cycle and pulse repetition \n\nfrequency. Huber and Pfisterer [34] used focused ultrasound to perform experiments on \n\nin vivo transfection with plasmid DNA at 1 MPa pressure amplitude. The authors found \n\nno evidence of increased incidence of metastasis. \n\n A study by Miller and Song [52] was designed to investigate the potential for \n\nsimultaneous gene transfer and tumor ablation with cavitation-enhanced FUS using a \n\n1.55MHz transducer and US image guidance to treat mouse renal carcinoma tumors in \n\nthe presence of microbubbles. Tumors were exposed for up to 0.4 seconds using a range \n\nof Peak Rarefactional Pressure Amplitudes (PRPA) of 2MPa to 8MPa. Tests were \n\nperformed to assess the influence of the microbubble injection route, burst duration and \n\npressure amplitude by reducing exposure duration and using multiple pulses. Evaluated \n\nboth in terms of the subsequent tumor growth and gene transfer, the expression of marker \n\nplasmids injected into the tumors indicated that tumor growth reduction and gene transfer \n\ncan be achieved with cavitation-enhanced FUS treatment, and that gene transfer tended \n\nto decrease with increasing exposure duration, or PRPA. The decrease in gene transfer \n\nmight be due to a decrease in cell viability, (the ability of cells to maintain or recover \n\nviability), which was not investigated.  The way by which cavitation enhanced gene \n\ndelivery is still not clear. \n\n Challenged to get closer to an ideal vector system, thus allowing an efficient and \n\nsafer transfection of virus into a target tissue, Meier-Humbert et al. [53] based their \n\nresearch on the assumption that DNA is transferred into cells across the plasma membrane \n\nvia ultrasound-induced pores. The authors tried to figure out the size of the pores created \n\nby ultrasound application and the duration of pore opening. A 2.25 MHz focused \n\nultrasound transducer operating at 570kPa was used to expose rat mammary carcinoma \n\ncells. Good DNA transfection on cells was achieved with a 10s exposure, duty cycle of \n\n20% and Pulse Repetition Frequency of 100Hz with cell viability assays showing more \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n46 \n\nthan 70% cell survival. The experimental conditions used gave results which showed that \n\nmacromolecules of up to 37 nm were delivered into cells; pores at least as large as 75 nm \n\nwere formed with the opening lasting milliseconds to seconds. \n\n The in vitro studies of Rahim et al. [54, 55] investigated individual exposure \n\nparameters using a system designed to minimise experimental artefacts, and to allow the \n\ncontrol of many parameters of the US field. They evaluated the targeting ability and \n\nspatial distribution of gene delivery using focused ultrasound by performing dosimetry in \n\nthe focal plane and in the homogeneous near-field. To study the influence of physical \n\nparameters [55], a 1MHz-transducer was used and a sinusoidal pulse was generated with \n\namplifier input amplitude up to 100 mV, pulse length up to 80 cycles, pulse repetition \n\nfrequency up to 2.5 kHz, duration of exposure up to 60s and microbubble concentration \n\nvarying from 0 to 16% by volume. Both cell viability and gene delivery were tested, and \n\nthe authors concluded that the optimal conditions for gene delivery with minimal impact \n\non cell viability were 0.25 MPa peak negative pressure at focus, PRF 1 kHz, 10s exposure, \n\n40 cycle pulse length and 4% microbubble concentration. In terms of spatial and acoustic \n\npressure dependence [54] exposures were performed at optimal conditions in terms of \n\nPRF, exposure time, pulse length and microbubble concentration, in a range of amplitudes \n\nfrom 0.35 to 1.4 MPa peak to peak pressure at the focus.  \n\n Analysis of gene delivery, cell viability and spatial distribution showed that \n\ndelivery in the focal plane was concentrated around the ultrasound beam axis and that \n\ntransfection efficiency increased as acoustic pressure increased towards the focus, \n\nreaching a maximum above 1 MPa. Delivery was microbubble dependent, and the cell \n\nviability was about 80% for the higher spatial average peak to peak pressure (0.88 MPa). \n\nBased on these results and exposure conditions, and with the aim of evaluating the \n\npotential for ultrasound/microbubble-mediated retroviral gene delivery, Taylor et al. [56] \n\nachieved good transfection results at peak-negative acoustic pressure amplitudes of 1.0 \n\nto 1.2 MPa (60 to 80 mV) using an exposure time of 5s and the pulse length of ten cycles \n\nper pulse. \n\n Other in vitro studies have looked at the effect of ultrasound on viral content \n\ntransfection and have been undertaken since, for the success of oncolytic virotherapy of \n\nsolid tumors, it is the efficiency of infection that is important [57, 58]. Clinical trials have \n\nalso been carried out using many viral vectors [59-62] to evaluate the factors that can \n\naffect infection since solid tumors contain a heterogeneous mixture of tumor and healthy \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n47 \n\ncells within an extracellular matrix supported by a tortuous vascular network [63]. Leaky \n\nvasculature and variable blood flow in tumors, lead to poor delivery of nutrients and \n\nimpaired clearance of metabolic breakdown products from the tumor [64], and also make \n\ndrug delivery difficult, because of the limited blood supply compared to normally \n\nvascularized tissues. Many solid tumors develop regions of hypoxia, which may lead to \n\nup-regulation of genes that predispose subjects to a more malignant phenotype [65, 66]. \n\n A different approach has addressed the question of which transduction route, i.e. \n\nthe path by which DNA is introduced into another cell via a viral vector, would be best \n\nfor plasmid and adenoviral delivery [67]. In their study, Agrawal et al., tested topical, \n\nintraflap and in vivo intravascular gene delivery using rat Superficial Inferior Epigastric \n\n(SIE) flaps. The extent of viral transduction through SIE flaps and its duration was \n\nassessed by non-invasive imaging of luciferase. Intravascular transduced flaps yielded \n\nthe most even distribution of virus but the presence of microbubbles did not result in a \n\nhigher expression of viral vector. Exposure conditions were fixed as follows: frequency \n\n1MHz, exposure duration 30s, duty cycle approximately 66.7%, PRF of 1 kHz, each pulse \n\nconsisting of 40 cycles of pressure amplitude 1.4 MPa (peak to peak) at the transducer \n\nfocus. \n\n Eisenberg et al. [68] completed a study relating hyperthermia and viral killing of \n\npancreatic cancer through a heat shock protein pathway, in which a recombinant Herpes \n\nSimplex virus (NV1066) was cultured with pancreatic cancer cells (Hs700). Cell survival \n\nand viral growth proved that heating the virus NV1066 with the cell line Hs700 up to \n\n42 ?C, for 4 hours, increased cell destruction by 80%. Increased viral efficacy was due to \n\nthe presence of a protein (Heat-shock protein 72, Hsp72) which is regulated by thermal \n\nstimuli and lends cellular protection by inhibiting apoptosis. This protein helps to increase \n\nviral replication and tumor cell destruction. \n\n Quantification of drug distribution is important in order to determine the ability \n\nof a drug to penetrate tissue within solid tumors. Both in vitro and in vivo techniques have \n\nbeen used for quantifying drug distribution. In vitro studies involving cell culture are a \n\ngood way of obtaining optimal parameters for virus infection. Another in vitro study \n\ninvolving virus was performed by Shintani et al. [57] using Herpes Simplex virus to infect \n\na mixed solution of normal and malignant cells. The effect of ultrasound and \n\nmicrobubbles was tested in experiments on different groups (Virus infection only, virus \n\ninfection and microbubbles/ultrasound, and then virus infection with both ultrasound and \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n48 \n\nmicrobubbles) in which exposure conditions with a 1 MHz ultrasound transducer were \n\nvaried in terms of ultrasound intensity (up to 2 W/cm2), duty cycle (up to 50%) and \n\nexposure time (up to 40s). This study gave optimal conditions in terms of maintenance of \n\ncell viability (0.5 W/cm2; 20% duty cycle and 10 s exposure) and showed a decrease of \n\naround 40% in cell viability for the extreme conditions tested, with exposure time being \n\nthe parameter that most affected cell survival and transfection. \n\n In vitro cell exposure is not the most effective way of obtaining the conditions that \n\nwill be valid for in vivo exposures. In in vitro cell exposures there is no absorbing \n\nmedium, and the shear stresses created by microstreaming in a fluid cause cell movement \n\ninside a solution. Bazan-Peregrino et al. [58] developed an in vitro model using a porous \n\ngel in a two-sided cylindrical container with acoustically transparent windows, and used \n\na metal rod to create a flow-through vessel of diameter 1.6 mm. The attenuation of this \n\ngel was approximately that of water.  \n\n The studies presented so far in this document, show a lack of cavitation control \n\nwhich seems to be crucial for understanding transfection of particles into a cell by \n\nultrasound and microbubbles. In Bazan-Peregrino et al. [58], cavitation is accounted for \n\nand ultrasonic pressures were chosen to maximize either broadband emissions, associated \n\nwith inertial cavitation, or ultraharmonic emissions, associated with stable cavitation, \n\nwhile varying duty cycle to keep the total acoustic energy delivered constant, in order to \n\nallow comparison across exposures. A Passive Cavitation Detector (PCD) consisting of a \n\n15 MHz spherically focused Piezoelectric Transducer (PZT), was coaxially and \n\nconfocally aligned with a 0.5 MHz FUS transducer. The raw signal from the PZT \n\ntransducer was amplified 25-fold, high pass filtered at 1 MHz (to reject reflections from \n\nthe drive frequency), and data was recorded at a sampling rate of 20 MHz with an 8-bit \n\ndigitizer. The optimal acoustic parameters were those used by Arvanitis et al [69] \u2013 the \n\nacoustic parameters in this study were specific to inducing inertial and stable cavitation. \n\nIn the presence of ultrasound and microbubbles, a peak rarefactional focal pressure \n\n(PRFP) of 360 kPa, a duty cycle of 90% and a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 10 Hz \n\nwere chosen to achieve stable cavitation. Conversely, PRFPs of 1250 kPa or 2400 kPa \n\nand duty cycle of 6% and 2%, respectively, were used with a PRF of 10 Hz to achieve \n\ninertial cavitation. For ultrasound only exposures, as stable cavitation could not be \n\nsustained, inertial cavitation was applied with a PRFP of 2400 kPa, 2% duty cycle and \n\nPRF of 10 Hz. All the exposures were set to 5 minutes and temperature was monitored \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n49 \n\nusing a T-type fine-needle thermocouple at the FUS focus (the rise never exceeded 0.2 ?C \n\nso no biologically significant US induced heating occurred). Luciferase activity indicated \n\nsuccessful infection to exposures involving both ultrasound and microbubbles, and, in \n\nterms of cell viability, the best results, in terms of the percentage of viable cells after \n\nexposure, were achieved with a PRFP of 1250 kPa and 6.5% duty cycle. \n\n A more recent publication by Bazan-Peregrino et al. [70] tried to identify the key \n\nparameters needed to optimize the combined use of oncolytic adenoviruses (OA) and \n\nfocused ultrasound. This optimization relies on the principle that ultrasound exposure \n\nparameters may be optimized as a function of tumor reperfusion time to sustain inertial \n\ncavitation throughout the exposure. Exposure conditions, in terms of PRFP and duty \n\ncycle, similar to their previous study were maintained [58], and PRF and exposure \n\nduration were changed to 0.5 Hz and 4 minutes, respectively. Intratumoral and \n\nintravenous injection protocols were applied using a modified adenovirus to express \n\nluciferase. Passive cavitation detection of acoustic emissions, during the in vivo treatment, \n\nindicated inertial cavitation as the mechanism responsible for enhanced delivery and \n\nenabled real-time monitoring of successful viral therapy. 3-fold, 12-fold and 50-fold \n\nincreases in uptake have been found in 50, 30 and 20% of the tumors under inertial \n\ncavitation inducing conditions.  \n\n Another in vivo approach to the field of virotherapy was undertaken by Carlisle et \n\nal. [71] who considered that almost all the publications with solid conclusions are based \n\non intratumoral release of virus [6] and assume that the limitations of the technique are \n\ndue to poor intravenous delivery. Of particular interest is the fact that systemic deliveries \n\nof treatments for metastatic cancer still require improved circulation kinetics, \n\nextravasation from the blood-stream into the tumor, and intratumoral penetration. \n\n Additionally the intratumoral distribution of viral content remains exclusively \n\nperivascular, without deep penetration into the tumor [72]. As a result, the therapeutic \n\neffect is restricted to a small proportion of a tumor\u2019s mass. The factors described led to \n\nresearch on the development of a virus coating polymer that enhances circulation and also \n\nallows triggered uncoating and reactivation of Adenoviruses within tumors. The \n\nexposures, again, were based on the findings of Bazan-Peregrino et al. [70] \u2013 they used a \n\n0.5 MHz transducer at peak rarefactional pressure of 1.2 MPa at PRF of 0.5 Hz but this \n\ntime the intention was to produce inertial cavitation monitored in real-time. The \n\nremaining exposure parameters were 100 ms pulse length, and 240 s exposure time. A  \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n50 \n\n30-fold enhancement in tumor infection was obtained when exposing polymer coated \n\nadenovirus in the presence of microbubbles. \n\n The last study to be discussed here, and one of the more recent ones, is that of \n\nGraham et al. [73] and addresses the same problem as that in the previously discussed \n\nstudy \u2013 namely that the clinical efficiency of stable liposomal delivery still has poor \n\npenetration into non-vascularised tumor regions and poor release of payload within the \n\ntumor. These liposomes are used to deliver powerful chemotherapeutics, which can cause \n\nsevere adverse effects in non-target tissues. Although the liposomal delivery is thought \n\nto be more stable, an improved formulation is desired during the intravenous delivery \n\nphase, following arrival within the tumor, so that the drug in its free form can provide \n\ngreater and more widespread effects in tissues [73]. Here, the importance of ultrasound is \n\naddressed - inertial cavitation can be used to trigger intratumoral release of drug from \n\nintravenously delivered liposomes non-invasively, and, simultaneously, inertial \n\ncavitation can be monitored through resulting acoustic emissions.  \n\n Graham et al. [73] used a 0.5 MHz focused ultrasound transducer, and cavitation \n\ndetection has been achieved using a 7.5 MHz passive cavitation detector, which was \n\nplaced in the centre of the transducer, and both were confocally and coaxially aligned. \n\nThis study includes in vitro and in vivo experiments and for the former, exposure \n\nconditions varied in terms of peak rarefactional focal pressures (from 0.14 to 1.5 MPa) \n\nwith fixed pulse length of 100 ms, 5% duty cycle and 30s exposure duration. Temperature \n\nwas recorded using a thermocouple placed within the phantom. In terms of in vivo \n\nexperiments for Graham et al. study, conditions were chosen on the basis of the work by \n\nBazan-Peregrino et al. [70] (1.2 MPa of PRFP, 6% duty cycle and 0.5Hz PRF) but with \n\nsome changes \u2013 total exposure time was 12 minutes and after every 90 seconds of \n\nexposure microbubbles were injected, with the focal volume being repositioned every 3 \n\nminutes. Despite the variability in intratumoral inertial cavitation levels and location, \n\nsufficient events associated with luciferin content occurred to instigate substantial and \n\nhighly significant increases in payload release. The study of Graham\u2019s group is the first \n\ndemonstration that such clinically applicable US parameters can be used to improve \n\nintratumoral payload release from an intravenously injected liposomal delivery agent. \n\n The combination of ultrasound and virus seems to be a potentially useful tool for \n\nimproving cancer treatment efficacy. The application of ultrasound can directly change \n\nthe structure or physiology of tissues, or can induce changes in a drug or vehicle in order \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n51 \n\nto enhance payload delivery. Uptake of virus has been proven to be increased by \n\nultrasound but a lot of work is still required to make this combined therapy clinically safe. \n\nAs presented by Bourke et al. [41], there are some features that turn a viral vector into an \n\n\u201cideal virotherapy agent\u201d. These are i) a specificity to cancer cells and consequent tumour \n\ndestruction, ii) the capacity for replication within neoplastic cells (which, in the best case, \n\ncan be exclusive to these cells), iii) an ability to cause only mild, self-limited or no human \n\ndisease, iv) the possibility of control and elimination of remaining viral particles after \n\ntreatment, v) to be genetically stable; and, finally, vi) to show zero recombination events \n\nwhile in use.  \n\n For the purpose of this thesis, a pilot project on a combined treatment using \n\nFocused Ultrasound, Vaccinia Virus, Melphalan and TNF-? in the presence of \n\nmicrobubbles is expected to contribute to advances to cancer therapies. This project starts \n\nwith the equipment preparation and the calibration necessary to know accurately the \n\noutputs of the equipment used and determination of the best equipment to use, then in \n\nvitro experiments used to help \u201cpre-vizualise\u201d the effects that one will get in vivo and \n\nfinally, in vivo experiments that allow the testing of whether Focused Ultrasound in the \n\npresence of microbubbles enhances the activity of oncolytic virotherapy delivered during \n\nIsolated Limb Perfusion.  Several mechanisms, including direct anti-tumour activity, \n\nenhancement of the activity of melphalan/TNF-alpha and increased intratumoural \n\ndelivery of oncolytic viruses were considered. \n\n  \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n52 \n\n2. Calibration of a Focused Ultrasound \nTransducer and Measurement of \n\nCavitation Thresholds under Different \n\nFrequencies \n \n\n \n\n 2.1. Transducers Calibration  \n \n\n \n\n2.1.1. Introduction \n\n \n\n The ultrasound beam generated by a plane transducer propagates as a longitudinal \n\nwave in soft tissue and has two distinct regions: near field (Fresnel zone) and far field \n\n(Fraunhofer zone). A focused ultrasound transducer produces a cylindrical beam that is \n\nnarrowest in the focal zone, some distance from the transducer face. This US beam has \n\nside lobes due to diffraction. For therapeutic medical applications of ultrasound, beams \n\nwith little lateral dispersion of energy are usually preferred and so the ultrasound beam is \n\noften focused. \n\n There is a wide variety of FUS transducers, reported in literature and in clinical \n\nuse, both in terms of geometry and drive frequency (fairly limited for FUS to the range \n\nof 0.5 to 4 MHz). It is important to design the transducer for its use and the following \n\nissues must be considered [74]: \n\n \n\n1. The location, accessibility and size of the target. \n\n2. The ability to deliver sufficient power to the required treatment depth, in order to \n\nprovide an effective treatment. This influenced by the focal length and outer \n\ndiameter of the transducer which determine the total power producing area and \n\nthe focusing strength, and the frequency used which affects how much energy is \n\nabsorbed at the target and lost in the overlying tissues. Lower frequencies are \n\nassociated with lower attenuation losses in the overlying path and higher \n\nfrequencies are favourable for greater absorption at the focus. \n\n3. The size of the transducers matters when the available range of motion of the \n\ntransducer is crucial for a specific application. \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n53 \n\n4. There must be a coupling medium between the transducer and the target and this \n\nis usually achieved with water baths in which either the transducer and the target \n\nare submerged, or one water bag is placed in between the transducer and the target. \n\n5. If diagnostic ultrasound imaging guidance is necessary, the ultrasound transducer \n\ncan be designed to incorporate an ultrasound imaging probe, preferably at its \n\ncentre, enabling imaging along the therapy beam axis. \n\n In terms of the properties of the ultrasound beam, some concepts are key to the \n\nneed for calibration of the acoustic field of ultrasound beams. In any application, the \n\nintensity in the FUS beam must be known and one must not forget that [74]: \n\n? In the focal plane, the power is not entirely contained within the focal \n\nregion, with some power being in side-lobe rings around the focal region.  \n\nThese are of lower intensity than the focus, and normally are of little \n\nconsequence in clinical treatments using short exposures. \n\n? In the pre-focal beam the maximum intensity generally increases moving \n\ntowards the focal plane; however, the intensity distribution is not \n\nhomogeneous and there are localised regions of high and low intensity. \n\n A quantitative characterization of the acoustic field of a FUS transducer can be \n\nmade using a hydrophone - a device which provides a localised measure of the acoustic \n\npressure. This quantitative characterization can include studies on the spatial variation \n\n(with beamplots) and/or variation of peak pressure(s) by changing the drive setting. \n\nMeasurements are usually performed in degassed water, in which the ultrasound beam \n\npropagates through a non-attenuating medium, in the absence of scattering structures and \n\ncavitation nuclei.  \n\n The choice of hydrophone is dependent on a number of factors, the main \n\nconsiderations being: robustness, the measurement environment (e.g. degassed water, \n\ndeionized water, coupling gel), sensor size, temporal stability, and flatness of the \n\nfrequency response. In terms of the sensor size, both the size of the sensitive area and the \n\nsize of the whole sensor because the first determines beamplot resolution and the other \n\nmay affect whether the sensor fits into a system at all. Robustness is a critical factor in \n\nHIFU characterisation, since the hydrophone sensor is likely to be exposed to large peak \n\nnegative pressures, and there is thus an associated risk of hydrophone damage from \n\nacoustic cavitation at its front face [74].  \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n54 \n\n For this study, in order to minimise the risk of hydrophone damage, the water used \n\nfor coupling medium is very well degassed (ideally less than 2 mg/l of dissolved oxygen), \n\nthe water is also filtered to remove particles bigger than 5 microns, so that there are fewer \n\ncavitation nucleation surfaces available and (iii) short pulses of ~40 cycles are used so \n\nthat we reach peak pressure, but reduce the number of cycles and therefore risk of \n\ncavitation. \n\nHydrophones, like ultrasound sources, are usually piezoelectric materials (they \n\nconvert sound pressure to a voltage and vice versa). If a hydrophone is placed in an \n\nacoustic pressure field it produces an electrical output signal in response to the surface \n\nintegral of the acoustic pressure received over its active element. Hydrophone calibration \n\nprovides a value for the sensitivity of the hydrophone (expressed in mV/Pa) as a function \n\nof frequency.  \n\nFor a waveform propagating linearly, the voltage values measured on an \n\noscilloscope, V(t), can be converted to pressure, p(t), using the hydrophone sensitivity, \n\ns(f) using the relationship        \n)(\n\n)(\n)(\n\nfs\n\ntV\ntp ?                                                                      (3) \n\n To decide on the best transducer to use in the present study, two transducers were \n\ncalibrated in terms of acoustic power measurements, at different frequencies \u2013 one at 1.08 \n\nMHz and 1.34 MHz, and a second at 1.66 MHz. The transducers and methods are \n\ndescribed in the next section. \n\n \n\n2.1.2. Methods to Transducers Calibration \n\n \n\n The calibration was performed using an automated beam plotting system \n\n(Ultrasonic Measurement System (UMS), Precision Acoustics, UK) \u2013 see figure 2.1. The \n\nultrasonic measurement system is controlled by the Host PC by means of dedicated \n\nLabVIEWTM based software. This application controls all aspects of the operation of the \n\nsystem including: \n\n? Communication with a LeCroy 64xi digital oscilloscope for acquistion of \n\naveraged waveforms  \n\n? Positioning in 3 orthogonal directions, via actuation of the stepper motors  \n\n? Waveform acquisition by the oscilloscope and subsequent transfer of data to the \n\nhost computer  \n\n? Archival and post-processing of acquired data. \n\n \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n55 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1. Schematic diagram of the beam plotting system \n\n Calibration was used to find which function generator drive levels (in mV) gave \n\nfree-field peak negative pressures from 0.3 to 1.8 MPa in increments of 0.3 MPa, knowing \n\nthat the sensitivity of the hydrophone HGL-0200 (ONDA, USA) was approximately 45 \n\nnV/Pa for the frequencies used. The range of peak negative pressures used was based on \n\nprevious publications on the subject of enhanced uptake of virus with the use of focused \n\nultrasound. \n\n A synchronisation signal was taken from a signal generator (the Function \n\nGenerator in Figure 2.1) and used to trigger the oscilloscope. The FUS transducer was \n\nheld in a fixed position perpendicular to the hydrophone, with both beam axes aligned \n\nparallel to each other, and was at first centred by visual inspection. The focus was then \n\nlocated by finding the maximum amplitude signal on the oscilloscope, while moving the \n\ngantry manually, being careful to ensure that the peak that had been found was not a side \n\nlobe. \n\n After finding the focal peak position using spatial increments of 0.5 mm, relatively \n\ncoarse one-dimensional scans were set up to record the pressure distribution along x, y \n\nand z, - see Figure 2.2 - to check the symmetry of the profile. The peak positive and peak \n\nnegative voltages were measured at each position from a waveform averaged 100 times. \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n56 \n\nThe root mean square voltage was calculated in Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc.), then \n\nconverted to the root mean square pressure \u2013 see equation 3. \n\n Pressure measurements were performed at the focal peak of the FUS field over a \n\nrange of signal generator voltage settings at the three different frequencies (for the two \n\ndifferent transducers) and at increments of 0.25 mm, over a distance of 4 mm around the \n\nfocus in two directions, X and Y. The water inside the UMS tank was filtered and \n\ndegassed to reduce the dissolved oxygen level (<2mg/l) to decrease the possibility of \n\ncavitation and UV light exposed to keep it clean. \n\n The series of files, each of which contained the voltage waveform acquired from \n\nthe hydrophone at each measurement location, was post-processed using Matlab code \n\ndesigned for the purpose (although UMS software could have been used). Linear scans \n\nof the pressure (in MPa) as a function of the distance from the focus (in mm) at each drive \n\nlevel were produced at the three different frequencies and then Pressure (in MPa) was \n\nplotted as a function of the Drive Level (in mV).  Peak negative pressure values will be \n\nconsidered for further applications because inertial cavitation is more likely to happen \n\ndue to the growth of a bubble during one cycle of tension (during the negative phase of \n\nacoustic cycle). \n\n In the next section, transducer calibration results are shown for measurements at \n\n1.08 MHz only, since similar results were found at the other two frequencies. The main \n\ndifference is that the focus is narrower at higher frequencies. The focal dimension at 1.08 \n\nMHz is (considering a planar oval shaped figure) ~13 mm height and ~1.79 mm width, at \n\n1.34 MHz, it is about ~13 mm height and and ~1.42 mm width and at 1.66 MHz it is ~10 \n\nmm height and 1.21 mm width. \n\n In terms of the error of the experiments, the National Physics Laboratory (NPL) \n\nwhich is the UK's National Measurement Institute - a world-leading centre of excellence \n\nin developing and applying the most accurate measurement standards, science and \n\ntechnology - specifies the error of the hydrophone detection to 7% of the measured value. \n\nHowever, a value an error of 10% of in each measurement was considered to avoid any \n\nunderestimation. This applies throughout the experiments in this dissertation. \n\n \n\n2.1.3.

Measurement of Cavitation Thresholds \n \n\n \n\n2.2.1. Brief Review on Cavitation Thresholds Measurement \n\n \n\n One of the first approaches to cavitation detection was reported in the early 90s.  \n\nHuber et al. [75] built a hydrophone based on the system designed by Staudenraus and \n\nEisenmenger [76] which detects changes in refractive index in the surrounding medium \n\narising from pressure changes. This device was compared with membrane and needle \n\nhydrophones in terms of its pressure sensitivity, but no attempt was made to quantify the \n\ndetected cavitation.  \n\n More recently, Koch and Jenderka [77] used a Fiber Optic Hydrophone (FOH) \n\nsystem based on a heterodyne interferometer to measure bubble activity in an ultrasonic \n\ncleaning bath filled with deionised, degassed water. The FOH was used to measure both \n\nthe incident acoustic pressure and half harmonic and broadband bubble emission signals, \n\nsimultaneously. Comparisons of the measured fundamental half harmonic and broadband \n\n\u201ccavitation noise power\u201d between 1-1.25 MHz were then made. These studies provided \n\ninformation regarding environments where cavitation is expected to occur, but have not \n\naddressed the lower limit of detection of cavitation signals at pressures close to the \n\ncavitation onset threshold, which is important for FUS applications. \n\n A number of definitions of cavitation thresholds exist in the literature. Studies \n\nhave used visual detection to determine a threshold pressure for either the appearance of \n\ncavitation bubbles coming out of solution [78] or the onset of oscillation and/or collapse \n\nof pre-existing microbubbles [79]. Typically, during biological studies, the amount of \n\ncavitation is quantified using a method considered appropriate for the application, and \n\nfrom these data a relevant pressure threshold can be defined if necessary. A number of \n\nstudies have chosen to use a \u201ccavitation dose\u201d type measurement which measures the total \n\namount of a \u201ccavitation signal\u201d received over a given time [80-82] but in these studies \n\nspecific pressure thresholds have not been defined. Chen et al. [83]  used summation of \n\nvoltage signals over a frequency range below the FUS drive frequency as \u201ccavitation \n\ndose\u201d. \n\n Kyriakou et al. [84] measured broadband activity within adipose tissue exposed \n\nto HIFU at different frequencies. They used the variance of voltage signals detected using \n\na 15 MHz centre frequency PCD, over a range of 5-20 MHz, after high-pass filtering at 5 \n\nMHz to exclude the HIFU drive frequency and the first 3 harmonics. Higher harmonic \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n62 \n\nfrequencies were also excluded from the broadband range, but comb filtering the data in \n\nsoftwar. Variance values were used to quantify inertial cavitation. The threshold for \n\ndetection of inertial cavitation was defined as the minimum negative pressure at which \n\nany signal greater than 6 standard deviations above noise occurred.  \n\n Inertial cavitation thresholds have been measured in a range of tissues and \n\nphantom materials by Maxwell et al. [85] for two-cycle HIFU pulses. To account for the \n\nmany harmonics present in the drive signal, the presence of cavitation was determined by \n\nmeasuring the deviation of an integrated power spectrum from expected values, \n\ncalculated from field measurements in the absence of cavitation. Thresholds were defined \n\nat the 50% probability level for which the measured integrated power was greater than 5 \n\nstandard deviations above the expected value. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2.2. Methods of Cavitation Thresholds \n\n \n\n For any FUS exposure the following are needed: a timer, a signal generator, an \n\namplifier, a pick-off box for measuring drive voltage and current, a scope to read the \n\nvoltage and current and a FUS transducer and an impedance matching box. As cavitation \n\ndetection was required, a PCD, filters, pre-amplifiers and a data acquisition system were \n\nalso used. The equipment used was as follows: \n\n \n\n? Timer Box Ultrasound Timer 2.0 (built in house) \n\n? Signal generator Agilent 33120A (Agilent Technologies, Singapore) \n\n? Power Amplifier E&amp;I A300 (Electronics &amp; Innovation, Florida) \n\n? Pick-off box built in house (to measure V/1000 and I*10) \n\n? Oscilloscope LeCroy Waverunner 64Xi (LeCroy Corporation, New York) \n\n? FUS transducer working at 1.66 MHz(Sonic Concepts, Washington) \n\n? Matching Box (Sonic Concepts, Washington)    \n\n? Passive Cavitation Detector (PCD) \n\n? Notch Filter (1.7 MHz) built in house \n\n? Pre-amplifier (Model 7866, Advanced Receiver Research, Burlington, CT, USA) \n\n? Desktop Computer as Data Acquisition System (Supermicro, United States) \n\n? acoustic 15 well plates  and well plate holder designed &amp; built in house \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n63 \n\n? Gantry (Time and Precision, Hampshire, UK) and in house built Motion \n\nController \n\n? Aluminium arm  \n\n? Control Computer Latitude E6510 (Dell Inc., United States)  \n\n? Perspex Water Tank \n\n? Fibre-optic hydrophone PAFOH10 (Precision Acoustics, Dorchester, UK) and \n\npurpose built fibre-optic hydrophone holder \n\n  \n\n Exposures of Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) cell culture medium \n\nwere made in acoustic well-plates developed in-house (see figure 2.9). These have a \n\npermanent, but replaceable, lower acoustically transparent window (19 micron thick \n\nMelinex) and are designed to be filled with the sample before an upper membrane is \n\nclamped into place (being careful to avoid trapping bubbles in any of the wells). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9. Schematic of well-plate built in house (left) and photograph (right). The volume of each well was \napproximately 0.5ml. The diameter is just under 7 mm wide which meant that if the 1.66 MHZ transducer was used \nthe beam should just clear the sides of the well when the focal peak is placed in the middle of the well (in 3D). \n\n \n\n In order to target each well on the well plate, a \u201csmall\u201d radiotherapy platform (see \n\nFigure 2.10) and its motion controller (not shown) were used and controlled using Matlab \n\ncode developed in-house. The radiotherapy platform allows precise control of positions \n\nin 3 orthogonal directions under remote computer control and in-house built software \n\nallow the movement between each well after localising on one of the corner wells. \n\n \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n64 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.10. Radiotherapy Platform used to move the ultrasound transducer automatically and precisely from well to \nwell. \n\n The targeting process did not require imaging guidance, but did require good \n\naccuracy. This setup allows the placement of a 10 mm long by 1.0 mm diameter focal \n\nregion in the centre of a 7 mm diameter, 7 mm long well using a specially built fibre-\n\noptic hydrophone holder designed to locate the centre of the well when filled with \n\ndegassed water and have no upper acoustic window. It should be noted that with cells in \n\nmedium or in medium only, it is very likely that acoustic cavitation will occur at much \n\nlower pressures than in tissue and that the radiation force associated with the ultrasonic \n\npressure wave will vigorously stir the solution due to acoustic streaming. Both of these \n\nproduce artefact effects. The setup for exposures in vitro is shown in Figure 2.11. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.11. Example for setup to exposures in vitro (the tank is filled with degassed water prior to any exposure). The \nwell-plate holder is holding a standard 96 well plate, which could not be used for US exposures because the thick \nperspex was not acoustically transparent and the plate could not be totally submerged. This means that there would \nbe almost complete reflection of the ultrasound beam at the liquid air interface in each well and so, ultrasound \nexposure levels could not be accurately measured. \n\n \n\n A PCD was used to detect any ultrasonic signals emitted by cavitating bubbles.  \n\nIn these experiments, the drive frequencies were 1.08, 1.34 and 1.66 MHz and broadband \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n65 \n\nsignals in the range of 3-10 MHz were recorded.  This range was chosen because apart \n\nfrom the primary resonance, a number of superharmonic resonances, usually of the \n\nfundamental and the half harmonic, can take place, for frequencies of excitation being \n\nbelow the natural frequency of the PCD which is 15 MHz. Adding to this, the highest \n\ncontribution, when an effect is present in cavitation detection data, comes from lower \n\nfrequencies. However, if lower frequencies are included in the analysis, there are potential \n\ncomplications from widening fundamental and second harmonics, which seem to be less \n\nproblematic from the 3rd harmonic on \u2013 this is based on previous experiments on \n\ncavitation detection in the ICR\u2019s Therapeutic Ultrasound Team. The signal from the PCD \n\nis passed through a notch filter centred at 1.7 MHz (Allen Avionics Inc., NY, USA), \n\nwhich reduces the component of the signal at the fundamental frequency (f0) of the HIFU \n\ndrive field by ~80 dB. This is done in order to avoid saturating the digitising electronics \n\nand preventing detection of the lower amplitude broadband and harmonic signals. Then, \n\nthe signal goes through a 20 dB preamplifier (Advanced Receiver Research, Burlington, \n\nCT, USA).  \n\n A data acquisition computer (DataQuest Solutions, Bedfordshire, UK), with two \n\n500 GB SATA hard drive and 12 GB RAM, allows the storage and processing of large \n\nquantities of PCD data in real time. A built-in 12-bit high speed Peripheral Component \n\nInterconnect (PCI) data acquisition (DAQ) card (Spectrum Systementwicklung \n\nMicroelectronic, Germany) with 256 MB on-board memory allows digitization and \n\nstorage of data from up to 4 channels at a maximum of 50 MHz sampling rates, in First \n\nIn First Out (FIFO) mode. This is important because, from the Nyquist limit this means \n\nthat the highest frequency that can be reliably detected is 25 MHz. Which is much higher \n\nthan the top of our broadband range of interest (10 MHz). A 2 step buffer strategy is used, \n\nwhereby the on-board memory of the acquisition card is used as a hardware buffer, and a \n\nspecific portion of the computer memory is set aside as an additional software data buffer. \n\nData is transfered from the on-board memory of the acquisition card to the computer \n\nmemory in small blocks via the dual buses of the PC. Both the block size and the software \n\nbuffer size can be user defined. \n\n The DAQ card is controlled by a 2-stage process. First, a code written in-house \n\nallows specification of the number of channels to be used, the desired sampling frequency, \n\nthe input impedances from the devices connected to each channel, and the total amount \n\nof time for which data should be acquired. For the purpose of the studies presented in this \n\nthesis, continuous data acquisition was required for the duration of each exposure \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n66 \n\n(typically 0.5 s), with additional \u2018off-time\u2019 (0.2 s) data which is used to calculate the \n\nbaseline noise level. \n\n The second stage includes a Matlab code which was written to communicate with \n\nthe acquisition card via Matlab drivers. This is based on a series of C and Matlab functions \n\nprovided by the DAQ card manufacturer, but was runned entirely in Matlab. The code \n\nfirst asks the user to specify a unique file identifier for the data (e.g. an exposure number). \n\nThe dynamic range of the digitising card must be selected to determine the voltage range \n\nover which the available digitisation levels are assigned. For the 12-bit card, the number \n\nof digitization levels was 212, or 4096. It was only possible to specify values of 200, 500, \n\n1000, 2000 or 5000 mV. It is important to specify a suitable dynamic range for the \n\nexpected signals. If the range specified is too high, the data would be contained within \n\nonly a small number of digitisation levels, leading to quantisation effects. On the other \n\nhand, the use of a range which was too low for the detected signals would result in \n\n\u201cclipping\u201d of the peak voltages (positive and negative). This introduces discontinuities in \n\nthe time domain, creating artefacts in the frequency domain which appear as data spikes. \n\nThe decision to use a particular dynamic range was in the most part based on prior \n\nexperience of the therapeutic ultrasound team, and both 1000 and 2000 mV were found \n\nsuitable for the experiments described in this thesis. \n\n Finally, the acquisition code sends the user-specified details to the acquisition \n\ncard, and programs it to wait for an external voltage trigger. This is provided by \n\nconnecting the synchronization port on a signal generator to a trigger channel on the data \n\nacquisition card. For the experiments described in this chapter, up to 2 channels were \n\nused, Ch0 was usually used to collect PCD data and Ch1 was used for the drive voltage. \n\nA sampling frequency of 33.2 MHz was used in all experiments throughout this thesis. \n\nData were saved in the computer memory in segments, and stored in binary format. Upon \n\nsubsequently reading of the files into Matlab, and with the knowledge of the dynamic \n\nrange setting used for each exposure, the values were then converted from integers back \n\ninto mV for processing.   \n\n This study of cavitation thresholds was done to i) study the difference in \n\nthresholds  depending on the HIFU frequency used, ii) chose the levels of pressure to use \n\nin in vitro exposures, iii) decide on the best frequency to use  when microbubbles were \n\npresent (the best frequency being the one closest to the resonant frequency of the \n\nmicrobubbles ). The SonoVue microbubbles used have resonant frequencies of 1.6, 2.1 \n\nand 3.1 MHz for bubbles of 4.0, 3.2 and 2.6 \u00b5m, respectively. According to the \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n67 \n\nmanufacturer\u2019s sheet, the  mean diameter of the microbubbles is 2.5\u00b5m, 90% are smaller \n\nthan 6\u00b5m and 99% smaller than 11\u00b5m. \n\n The results presented here are from cavitation detection at 1.08MHz, 1.34MHz \n\nand 1.66 MHz during exposure of DMEM only, and medium with 10 or 10% \n\nconcentration of microbubbles. The Pulse Repetition Frequency was fixed at 100 Hz, the \n\npulse length was 40 cycles and the exposure of 0.5 s.   The pressures applied at 1.08 and \n\n1.66 MHz varied from 0 to 1.8 MPa in increments of 0.3 MPa  but at 1.34 MHz the \n\npressures varied from 0.2  to 1.2 MPa, in increments of 0.2 MPa. At the three different \n\nfrequencies tested, one exposure was made at each drive level.  All the conditions tested \n\nare based on information gathered from the literature review.  \n\n In terms of threshold definition, the increments tested did not allow accurate \n\ndetermination of the exact  level of pressure at which inertial cavitation onset, occuring \n\nwithin the 0.5s exposure, could be detected. It was therefore defined by the interval in \n\nwhich cavitation started to occur every time, such that in the time domain analysis, on a \n\nlogarithmic scale, a \u201chump\u201d one order of magnitude higher than the noise level (in terms \n\nof amplitude of the detected signal, in mV) was present (unique spikes above the threshold \n\nline are not considered as broadband). There is not enough data available for a quantitative \n\ndefinition of the inertial cavitation threshold in DMEM and therefore an initial study was \n\ndone to get an estimate of what it might be. \n\n A more rigorous study would require closer inspection of PCD broadband off-\n\ntime noise data from several exposures. A baseline would then be defined, for example, \n\nfrom the calculation of the mean and standard deviation of the noise levels. The signal \n\nexceeding the defined signal baseline over a certain length of time could then be \n\nconsidered as inertial cavitation. Single data points exceeding the baseline noise level \n\nmay occur during the FUS on-time, so it is important to consider an interval of time for \n\nthe threshold which distinguished occasional spikes/interference from the surrounding \n\nenvironment , from real cavitation activity. \n\n \n\nSignal Processing and Analysis \n\n \n\n The signal has been integrated over the frequency range of 3-10 MHz. Summing \n\ndata minimizes effects of inherent phase differences between voltage and current (caused \n\nby impedance mismatch) such that power fluctuations reflect impedance changes caused \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n68 \n\nby bubble formation in the acoustic propagation path. Then, data was Fourier transformed \n\n(FFT) using a Hanning window function.  \n\n The level of broadband emission was obtained using a two-step process. \n\nFollowing the FFT calculation, a \u2018\u2018comb\u2019\u2019 software filter was used to remove any \n\nharmonics (produced by nonlinear propagation) and subharmonics of the drive signal \n\nfrom the data. This filter set the amplitude of each harmonic to zero, to prevent their \n\ncontribution to the broadband signal. Summation of amplitudes in the resultant \n\ndiscontinuous frequency band gave the \u2018\u2018integrated broadband\u2019\u2019 emission amplitude over \n\nthe entire exposure time. Thus, half harmonic and integrated broadband amplitudes, could \n\nbe plotted as a function of time.  \n\n Audible emission data were processed using Matlab to extract temporal \n\ninformation by using 2048 points per FFT calculation, yielding a temporal resolution of \n\n9 ms. \n\n \n\n2.2.3.

There is a \n\ndifference between these measurements \u2013 the medium (DMEM) was of the same, but was \n\ntested under different conditions. For the first measurements at 1.08 MHz, the medium \n\nused had been transfered from the main bottle (stored in a cold room at approximately \n\n5\u00baC) to a falcon tube one day before the experiment, and for the experiments at 1.34 MHz \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n79 \n\nthe sample was transfered to a falcon tube on the day of the experiment.

In all the experiments \n\nat 1.34 and 1.66 MHz, the samples of DMEM were maintained at room temperature \n\n(~23\u00ba) for approximately 1h prior to experiments.  \n\n The other difference in between experiments at 1.08 MHz and at 1.34 MHz is that \n\nthe beam width at 1.08 MHz is wider, so the energy is spread into a wider region. In terms \n\nof experimental variation it would have been important to repeat at least measurements \n\nat one frequency to see how reproducible the results were. It is not possible to state if the \n\nreason for the difference in results is the state of the medium or the use of a different \n\nfrequency. There are also uncertainties in the pressures - each pressure quoted is +/- 10%. \n\nThis is not a big value but the pressure levels tested were quite far apart so the uncertainty \n\nin the cavitation threshold is bigger than this. Finally, by definition, it is harder to detect \n\nsmaller amounts of broadband, so the sensitivity of the hydrophone decreases with the \n\namount of cavitation. \n\n \n\nii) DMEM plus 10% of microbubbles  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.32.

To compare broadband activity at 1.08 and 1.34 MHz, in DMEM medium with \n\n10% microbubbles see figures 2.22 and 2.34.

Again, this could be due to the fact that at this higher frequency, we are closer \n\nto the resonant frequency of the microbubbles and so, sustained cavitation events are \n\npossible.  \n\n These microbubbles are excellent ultrasound scatterers due to their high \n\ncompressibility. In an ultrasound field they act as resonant systems, resulting in energy at \n\nthe subharmonic, ultraharmonic and higher harmonic frequencies in the backscattered \n\nultrasound signal.  Any medium with a real pressure wave in it is likely to be non-linear \n\n- propagation of FUS creates harmonics (in the absence of bubbles). Only when there are \n\nbubbles it is possible to get half harmonic (and potentially other subharmonics), and, at \n\nfinite pressures, harmonics of these. So half and ultra harmonics only occur when there \n\nare bubbles, but there are strong harmonics due to non-linear propagation. Although the \n\nbubbles will also contribute to the harmonics of the FUS, this will be a very small fraction \n\nof the total harmonic energy. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n82 \n\niii) DMEM plus 20% microbubbles \n\n \n\nFigure 2.36.

In vivo a 1.5 MHz transducer will be used, this analyses discards the use of \n\nthe transducer at 1.08 MHz which has been tested just to have a better compreension of \n\nhow frequency can influence the inertial cavitation threshols. The difference in frequency \n\nfrom 1.34 MHz and 1.66 MHz to 1.5 MHz is the same (\u00b10.16 MHz). As the higher \n\nbroadband amplitude seen happens at 1.34 MHz and as in vivo there is attenuating \n\nmedium and inertial cavitation is not likely to happen, the 1.66 MHz transducer will be \n\nused to perform in vitro experiments. \n\n The limitation of this study is that it is only possible to make a qualitative analyses \n\nrather than a quantitative one and if it was done presently, only the two frequencies of \n\nmore interest would be tested as these experiments are very time consuming and there \n\nwas not enough time to make repeats on the experiments made to test the reproducibility \n\nof the study.  \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n89 \n\n3. In Vitro Study on the Effects of \n\nFocused Ultrasound on BN175 \n\nSarcoma Cell Line \n \n\n \n\n3.1. Introduction to the In Vitro Study \n \n\n \n\n Research into the potential of ultrasound and microbubbles to enhance drug \n\ndelivery has been undertaken over the last decades, and concepts such as sonoporation, \n\ni.e. the formation of temporary pores in the cell membrane, and enhanced endocytosis \n\nhave been suggested as the main biological mechanisms involved [88, 89]. In general, the \n\nuptake of drugs or small molecules is attributed to ultrasound mediated transient \n\npermeabilization of the cell membrane. This transient permeabilization can be the result \n\nof stable and/or inertial cavitation events in the presence or absence of artificial \n\nmicrobubbles. \n\n At very low acoustic pressures, microbubbles oscillate in a symmetrical, linear \n\nway, but at higher ultrasound intensities, microbubbles behave non-linearly as the \n\nmicrobubbles become more resistant to compression than to expansion [86]. During \n\nstable microbubble cavitation there is gas influx (during expansion) and gas efflux (during \n\ncompression). In the case of symmetrical oscillations, the net gas influx over one \n\nexpansion/compression cycle is zero. However, when the expansion phase extends, there \n\nis  net gas influx.The microbubble grows until it reaches its resonant size, whereupon it \n\nundergoes stable, low amplitude oscillation. Such stable oscillations create a liquid flow \n\naround the microbubbles - microstreaming [87]. Oscillating microbubbles in the vicinity \n\nof cells, exert shear stresses. At these lower ultrasound intensities, two mechanisms which \n\ncontribute to the uptake of cell impermeable molecules, namely (i) the formation of small \n\npores [88] and (ii) endocytosis [89] have been postulated. \n\n At higher ultrasound intensities, the oscillation amplitude of a microbubble can \n\ngrow rapidly during the low pressure phase, until the microbubble collapses. What \n\nhappens is that the bubbles grow \u201ctoo\u201d big and then when they start collapsing the forces \n\nthat makes them grow again is not big enough to stop the collapse so the bubbles implode. \n\nThis type of cavitation is described as inertial cavitation. During collapse, shock waves \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n90 \n\ncan be generated in the fluid and jet formation can occur - an asymmetrical collapse which \n\nresults in the formation of a liquid jet towards a nearby surface. It has been shown that \n\nshock waves and microjets create very high forces that can create pores in the cell \n\nmembrane [90]. While stably cavitating microbubbles need to have direct contact with \n\nthe cell to affect the membrane, the effects of inertial cavitating microbubbles extend over \n\na larger distance [91]. \n\n The main objectives of the project are to study tumor virus distribution and then \n\nto quantify viral particle uptake using appropriate assays (e.g. qPCR, Plaque Assay, \n\nImmunofluorescence). As an initial approach, in vitro experiments were performed with \n\nthe BN175 rat sarcoma line in the presence or absence of (i) focused ultrasound (ii) \n\nmicrobubbles and (iii) focused ultrasound and microbubbles. The physical parameters to \n\nbe optimised in terms of maintained cell viability are peak negative pressure, Duty Cycle \n\n(the percentage of time it takes for a signal to complete an on-and-off cycle in which a \n\nsignal is active), pulse repetition frequency, exposure duration and microbubble \n\nconcentration. Once a range of optimal parameters was found, they were used in vivo in \n\nBrown Norwegian rats in order to determine optimal in vivo conditions. Optimal \n\nconditions mean that cell viability is not compromised and while experimenting in vivo, \n\nthe virus can get into the tumor cells and replicate. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.

Results and Discussion of the In Vitro Study \n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3.1. Results from MTT Assays \n\n \n\n MTT Assays \n\n \n\n The MTT assay is a colorimetric assay that measures the reduction of yellow 3-\n\n(4,5-dimethythiazol- 2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) by mitochondrial \n\nsuccinate dehydrogenase. The MTT enters the cells and passes into the mitochondria \n\nwhere it is reduced to an insoluble, coloured (dark purple) formazan product. The cells \n\nare then solubilised with an organic solvent (eg. isopropanol) and the released, solubilised \n\nformazan reagent is measured spectrophotometrically. Since reduction of MTT can only \n\noccur in metabolically active cells the level of activity, and thus the colour intensity, is a \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n95 \n\nmeasure of the viability of the cells. This assay was used to verify the number of living \n\ncells imediately, one and three days after an ultrasound exposure.  \n\n The results shown here are allways relative to the unexposed control population \n\nof each day. The Optical Density (OD) is normalised to 100% so that the effect on \n\ndifferent days can be compared. A more accurate way of applying this assay would be to \n\nstandardize a Viability Curve of the number of cells as function of the OD read in the \n\nspectrophotometer. For the duration of this project, this was not possible because the cell \n\nline was really unstable and the cell culture did not allways grow at the same rate between \n\nexperiments. Although, the results are presented in a relative manner which is still good \n\nenough for the purpose of this pilot study. \n\n The in vitro study was performed using the 1.66 MHz transducer . This was chosen \n\nbecause the transducer of the VIFU system (used for in vivo experiments) only works at \n\n1.5 MHz, and the transducers available for  in vitro measurements could only be driven \n\nat 1.08, 1.34 and 1.66 MHz. The transducer which operated  at 1.08 and 1.34 was most \n\neffective at 1.08 MHz,  and so this frequency was tested, although this much lower than \n\nthat that would be used in vivo. While 1.34 MHz, is as closer to the frequency of the VIFU \n\ntransducer to be used, the broadband detection at 1.66 MHz is of lower amplitude in the \n\ntime domain and in in vivo experiments cavitation is not as likely to occur as it happens \n\nin a non-attenuating medium \u2013 as previously discussed Chapter 2,  in section 2.2.3. \n\n Fixed conditions have been used for each parameter under investigation on the \n\nday of exposure, 1 and 3 days after at 1.66 MHz. For the study on the effect of pressure \n\non cell viability (compared to control) the fixed parameters were PRF of 100 Hz, DE of \n\n0.5 seconds and 40 cycles. For the study on the effect of pulse repetition frequency the \n\nfixed parameters were PNP of 0.6MPa, DE of 0.5 seconds and 40 cycles. To investigate \n\nthe effect of duration of exposure the fixed parameters used were PNP of 0.6MPa, 100Hz \n\nPRF and 40 cycles. Finally, to study the effect of duty cycle the fixed parameters used \n\nwere PNP of 0.6MPa, 100Hz PRF and 40 cycles. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n96 \n\n1 .

Results from 3 independent experiments on viability of cells only exposed to different levels of pressure 3 \ndays after exposure. Error bars shown are the percentage of standard deviation of each sample (n=8) for the different \ndrive levels used. \n\n \n\n Figures 3.2 \u2013 3.4, represent the data from 3 independent experiments with a fixed \n\nnumber of cells (approximately 15000 cells per well) in DMEM, from day 0 to day 3, \n\nrespectively. These cells were exposed to three different levels of pressure at 1.66 MHz. \n\nThe pressure levels were no ultrasound  exposure (0 MPa), at the level to just get inertial \n\ncavitation (0.6 MPa), during inertial cavitation (0.9 MPa) and at a high level of inertial \n\ncavitation (1.8 MPa) \u2013 from information collected during the analysis of cavitation \n\nthresholds in Section 2.2.3.  \n\n In day 0, the exposure seems to have a minimal effect on the viability of cells as \n\nthe viability is within a standard deviation of 100% (Figure 3.2). One day after the \n\nexposure (Figure 3.3), there is high variability in the results and their associated standard \n\ndeviation. A difference in viability of ~ \u00b120% at 0.6 MPa suggests that there is no effect \n\nof ultrasound up until, and including at, day 3 \u2013 see Figure 3.4. At 0.9 MPa no effect is \n\nseen at day 0, but the results from days 1 and 3 suggest that approximately 80% of the \n\ncells were killed. At 1.8 MPa, it is clear that the effect of ultrasound exposure  is greater \n\n\u2013 in day 0, approximately 85% of the cells survive; in day 1, despite a large standard \n\ndeviation, an average viability of 75% is found, and in day 3, only ~ 45% of the cells are \n\nalive.  These experiments require a lot of practice to perfect and improve experimental \n\ntechnique.  Poor pippeting, errors in counting cells or making dilutions, loss while \n\ntransferring cells from one flask to another, loss of cells while transferring them to the \n\nwell plate and/or while taking them out.  The systematic errors mentioned above, can also \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n98 \n\nbe seen at 0 MPa, in which no exposure is applied, and a spread in survival is seen. The \n\ndifferences in the cell cycle kinetics contribute to the error as biological variability. There \n\nare four phases in the cell cycle, taking from 10 \u2013 20 hours depending on cell type and \n\ndevelopmental state. The Interphase stage comprises G1, S, and G2 phases - when \n\nmacromolecules are synthesized, the cell roughly doubles its cellular mass and is prepared \n\nfor the mitotic (M) phase. Nondividing cells exit the G1 phase, entering a quiescent G0 \n\nstate. The results here are the average values from 3 independent experiments. The \n\nstandard deviation between measurements is, for most of the results in this section, \n\ndifferent, but the error bars match in almost all cases. This means that there is \n\nreproducibility between independent experiments but more experiments are necessary to \n\nincrease the reproducibility of this study. \n\n   \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5.

The trend of this group of \n\nresults is similar to that without microbubbles. A pressure of 0.6 MPa gives a viability \n\nclose to 100% in day 0, ~ 85% in day 1 and a viability of approximately 55% in day 3  \n\n(these are averages from 3 independent measurements).   \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n100 \n\n At 0.9 MPa, in day 0, one of the three experiments is not comparable to the other \n\ntwo the error bars do not overlap. This lack of overlap is also seen at Day 3. Despite this, \n\nit can be seen that a concentration of 1% microbubbles has little added effect on the \n\nnumber of cells surviving, compared with the results seen in their absence, at all \n\nultrasound exposure levels. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8.

Error bars shown are the percentage of \nstandard deviation of each sample (n=8) for the different drive levels used. \n\n  \n\n Figures 3.8-3.10, represent the data from 3 independent experiments with ~ 15000 \n\ncells/ well with a 10% concentration of microbubbles, from days 0 to 3, respectively. In \n\nday 0, at 0.6 MPa only 20% of the cells seem to be unaffected by the exposure to \n\nultrasound in the presence of microbubbles. This value increases to 40% in day 1 and in \n\nday 3, the large spread in survival found makes it difficult to draw a firm conclusion \u2013 \n\nsee Figure 3.10. This spread could be due to poor experimental technique, as discussed \n\nearlier or to a problem with the cells themselves. At 0.9 MPa, only two independent \n\nexperiments seem to be reproducible for day 0 because one (the green one in Figure 3.8) \n\nis really diferent in terms of result and associated error. However, it is not possible to \n\ndetermine if the results represented by the green trace are bad results when compared to \n\nthe other two sets of results (presented in blue and red traces in Figure 3.8) \u2013 more \n\nexperiments would be needed to guarantee the reproducibility of this study. Considering \n\nthis, all the results are under analysis and so, it can be considered that in day 0 \n\napproximately 75% of the cells are alive after the exposure to ultrasound in the presence \n\nof 10% concentration of microbubbles; approximately 25% in day and around 20% are \n\nalive of day 3. The higher level of pressure gives a viability close to 70% in day 0, 20% \n\nin days 1 and 3.  \n\n The results presented so far suggest that increasing the concentration of \n\nmicrobubbles decreases the cell viability  which can be attributed to the increased level \n\nof inertial cavitation.   This might compromise the membranes in such a way that they \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n102 \n\ncan not survive or reproduce. The influence of inertial cavitation is also suggested by the \n\nfact that even whithout microbubbles, an increased pressure amplitude for reduces the \n\nviability of the cells.

The times \n\nchosen for study were 1, 5 and 10 seconds. This times were chosen because in vivo, an \n\nexposure grid needs to be defined and each point of the grid must be exposed for only a \n\nfew seconds to allow the exposure of a large volume of the tumor during the conduct of \n\ntheisolated limb perfusion. \n\n Figures 3.23 \u2013 3.25 represent the data from 3 independent experiments with ~ \n\n15000 cells/ well) in DMEM, from day 0 to day 3, respectively, to test the effect of \n\nexposure duration on the viability of cells. These figures show the minor effect of this \n\nparameter on their survival. This is thought to be due mainly  to the fact that the medium \n\nis not acoustically absorbing enough to raise the temperature to a cytotoxic level. An \n\ninteresting issue to analyse is whether the effect on the membranes is greater for a longer \n\nexposure. \n\n On the day of exposure, the survival is ~ 100% for all exposure times.  One day \n\nafter the exposure, exposures of 1 and 5 seconds give survival around 100%, but an \n\nexposure of 10 seconds yields a decrease of around 15% in cell viability. Three days after \n\nthe exposure, the cells exposed to ultrasound for one or five seconds have their viability \n\ndecreased to approximately 80% and the group of cells exposed to ultrasound during 10 \n\nseconds show a percentage of viability around 50% relative to unexposed controls. \n\n   \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n110 \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.26.

Error bars shown are the \npercentage of standard deviation of each sample (n=8) for the different drive levels used. \n\n \n\n Once again, since the variation in exposure time had little effect on cell survival, \n\nthe most extreme condition, in terms of inertial cavitation, was also tested  - cells in \n\nDMEM with a concentration of microbubbles of 10% -. The results are shown in Figures \n\n3.26 \u2013 3.27, for the day of the experiment, 1 and 3 days after, respectively. \n\n Even in the presence of  a 10% concentration of microbubbles, changing the \n\nexposure time has little effect on cell viability in days 0 and 1, where the survival is ~ \n\n100%. In day 3, 70%, 80% and 60% survival  is associated with exposures of 1, 5 and 10 \n\nseconds respectively. The cells used are a sarcoma line, and it may not be a disadvantage \n\nif the cells die a few days after the exposure. The main goal is to help the virus to get \n\nthrough the membranes of the cell to allowit to start replicating and spreading throughout \n\nthe tumor. In the presence or absence of virus, a delayed cell killing may be \n\nadvantageous.. \n\n As a summary, Figures 3.29 \u2013 3.31 try to show a trend for each condition tested \n\nin the day of exposure, 1 day and 3 days after the exposure. The presence of 10% \n\nmicrobubbles on the sample has a similiar effect to that seen in the absence of \n\nmicrobubbles in terms of viability, considering the mean of the three independent \n\nexperiments \u2013 see Figure 3.31. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n112 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.29.

Only \n\na minor effect is seen immediately after exposure when this parameter is varied.of In days \n\n1 and 2, exposure with a 5% duty cycle gives a viability of ~ 100%, but with a duty cycle \n\nof 20%, a reduction of approximately 25% in viability is seen. In day 3 there is an ~ 20% \n\nincrease in viability with a duty cycle of 2%, as is seen in Figure 3.34. For a duty cycle \n\nof 5%, the viability is around 95% and for a duty cycle of 20%, it is around 85% - greater \n\nthan 1 day after the exposure. This shows the ability of the viable cells to proliferate after \n\nthe exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.35.

Effect of Ultrasound exposure at different acoustic Pressures of DMEM on cell \n\nsurvival \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.41. Study on the effects of pressure on DMEM. Medium was exposed to ultrasound under different drive levels \nof pressure and then cells were added to the exposed medium to verify if they would attach and grow compared to \ncontrol (same number of cells added to unexposed medium). Error bars shown are the percentage of standard \ndeviation of each sample (n=8) for the different drive levels. \n\n \n\n The effect of ultrasound in DMEM was tested to investigate the changes seen in \n\nthe experiments with cells had to do with effects on the cells themselves, or if there was \n\nsome change in the medium, for example in the pH, that could end up killing the cells. \n\nFigure 3.41 shows the results of this experiment and it is possible to see that both in the \n\nabsence and in the presence of SonoVue microbubbles, the cell viability are allways close \n\nto 100%, within errors. There may be some toxicity associated with the presence of \n\nmicrobubbles but this was statistically insignificant. Any ultrasound induced change in \n\nthe mediumwas sufficiently small (approximately \u00b110% in terms of percentage of \n\nviability compared to control) that it would not be an important factor in in vitro \n\nexperiments. FACS analysis was used to investigate whether there was any change in cell \n\nmembranes. \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n120 \n\n3.3.3. Results of FACs Analysis \n\n \n\n \u201cFACS\u201d stands for Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting. This is a type of flow \n\ncytometry \u2013 an analytical cell-biology technique that utilizes light to rapidly and \n\naccurately count and profile cells in a heterogenous fluid mixture. When additional \n\ninformation is required, antibodies tagged with fluorescent dyes, and raised against highly \n\nspecific cell surface antigens can be used to better identify and segregate specific sub-\n\npopulations within a larger group. In a flow cytometer a source of light is used to \n\nilluminate sample cells, travelling through a channel with photomultipliers, to detect \n\nrefracted or emitted light from the cells. Data acquired by the sensors is then processed \n\ngiving a  detailed \u201cpicture\u201d of the sample and emissions from fluorescent dyes. A flow \n\ncytometer is made up of three main systems: fluidics, optics, and electronics. The fluidics \n\nsystem transports particles in a stream to the laser beam for interrogation; The optical \n\nsystem consists of lasers to illuminate the particles in the sample stream and optical filters \n\nto direct the resulting light signals to the appropriate detectors; The electronics convert \n\nthe detected light signals into signals that can be processed by a computer with the \n\nappropriate software. \n\n  For the purpose of this thesis, this assay was used to detect the presence of a dye \n\nnamed Propidium Iodide (PI) dye inside a living cell. Propidium iodide is a membrane \n\nimpermeable dye that is generally excluded from viable cells. It binds to double stranded \n\nDNA by intercalating between base pairs. PI is excited at 488 nm and emits at a maximum \n\nwavelength of 617 nm. Pi detection is an indicationthat there is a change in the cell \n\nmembrane after an ultrasound exposure.  \n\n The amount of scattered light detected by the photomultipliers is related to the \n\nsize and shape of the cells. The light intensity in the forward direction (along the axis that \n\nthe light is traveling) defines the size of the cell, and the amount of light scattered to the \n\nside (perpendicular to the axis that the light is traveling) is related to their shape and \n\nhomogeneity (granularity/complexity). Specialized software (FACSDiva, Version 6.1.3) \n\nallows the choice of a gate in which cells of interest (in terms of size and shape) are \n\nincluded. The difference from controls is determined from the statistical information on \n\nthe populations under analysis.  \n\n The controls under study were unexposed cells, those exposed at 0.6 MPa (low \n\nexposure) and those exposed at 1.8MPa (high exposure), with or without PI. All the \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n121 \n\ncontrols include microbubbles (20% concentration to guarantee an extreme condition) to \n\nbe sure that cavitation was present. Figures 3.42-3.44 show the data for controls without \n\nPI, which were used to help interpret the results on exposed cells. Population 1 (P1), \n\ndefines the group of cells under study. The low level of Side-Scattered Light relates to \n\ndead cells  and the high Forward-Scattered signal shows cell doublets, i.e. the double \n\ndetection of the signal from a cell, giving the impression that a cell is bigger than the \n\nothers. The P1 gate includes two subpopulations. The one on the left (P3) and the one on \n\nthe right. The one on the left is the dying population the one on the right is the living one \n\n(P2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.42.

In Vivo Study on the Development \nof a Combined Treatment for \n\nCancer using Virus and Focused \n\nUltrasound \n \n\n \n\n4.1. Introduction to the In Vivo Study \n \n\n \n\nSonoporation describes the ultrasound technique in which the permeability of a \n\ncell membrane is changed. This alteration in the membrane generates a passage through \n\nwhich small molecules can enter. During the last decades, research on Focused \n\nUltrasound and microbubble mediated Virotherapy has been carried out and proved to be \n\na promising approach to cancer treatment. The treatments under study include strategies \n\nsuch as viral transduction of tumour cells with \u2018suicide genes\u2019, using viral infection to \n\ntrigger immune-mediated tumour cell death, and the use of oncolytic viruses for their anti-\n\ntumour action.  \n\nPre-clinical studies have identified isolated organ perfusion as a successful \n\nmodality for the extravasation of particles within perfused tissue. For oncolytic viruses, \n\nsonoporation seems to be an important method of increasing viral uptake in cells, but the \n\nsafety and efficiency of the overall process must be optimised for clinical use. Although \n\nthe combination of focused ultrasound and the biological effects of virus has already been \n\nsuggested as a useful technique to cancer treatment, the addition of a novel technique \n\nsuch as happens with Isolated Limb Perfusion to avoid uncontrolled infection of other \n\norgans may provide a more efficient way of killing malignant cells. \n\nThe toxicity of viral therapy is a concern and to minimize it, ILP was developed. \n\nThis is a chemotherapeutic technique using melphalan, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and \n\noncolytic vaccinia virus and involving the cannulation of the blood vessels which feed \n\nthe tumour-bearing region and isolation of the limb from the systemic circulation by \n\ntourniquet. This is necessary because of the severe toxicity of TNF-?. In this project, the \n\ncombination of ILP and FUS in the presence of microbubbles to increase viral penetration \n\nof tumour bulk in Brown Norwegian rats transfected with BN175 fibrosarcoma cells is \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n128 \n\nstudied. The perfused leg forms a collateral blood supply, which supplies the limb while \n\nthe femoral artery and vein are isolated from the systemic circulation.  \n\n For the purpose of this dissertation the aims of this in vivo studie are: \n\n1. Characterisation of the effects of FUS and MB on standard ILP with \n\nmelphalan/TNF-alpha in rat distal limb sarcoma.  \n\n2. Evaluation of FUS + MB over low (~7MPa) and high (~11MPa) ultrasound \n\npressures as a means of enhancing intratumoural delivery of oncolytic virotherapy \n\nduring ILP.  \n\n \n\nThese studies included the evaluation of viral biodistribution using viral plaque \n\nassays, quantitative PCR, analysis of gene expression  and non-invasive imaging \n\n(bioluminescent and GFP/RFP imaging) for characterisation of the effects of therapeutic \n\nFUS + MB with ILP-delivered oncolytic virotherapy. \n\n \n\n4.2. Methods used for the In Vivo Study \n \n\n \n\n This part of the project was carried out, as part of a joint study, with the help of \n\nHenry Smith \u2013 a Clinical Research Fellow at the Institute of Cancer Research.

GLV-1h68 was produced and provided by Genelux Corporation (San \n\nDiego).  \n\n - GLV-1h68 was constructed by inserting three expression cassettes into the \n\nF14.5L, J2R and A56R loci of the viral genome.  \n\n - Recombinant rat TNF-? (First Link Ltd, Birmingham, UK) was dissolved in PBS \n\nto a concentration of 100 mg/mL. \n\n -Therapeutic agents were added to the perfusate reservoir at the following doses: \n\nmelphalan - 40 \u00b5g, TNF-? - 50 \u00b5g, GLV-1h68 - 1 \u00d7 107plaque forming units (pfu).  \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n129 \n\nThe ILP technique is shown schematically in figure 4.1. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1.

The yellow \narrows point to the components labelled in figure 4.1.1. \n\n  \n\nAnimals \n\n -  Specific pathogen-free, male Brown Norwegian rats (200\u2013250 g) aged 8-10 \n\nweeks,  were housed in compliance with all relevant regulatory requirements and fed \n\nstandard chow and water ad libitum. \n\n - BN175 cells were harvested from tissue culture flasks and washed in PBS three \n\ntimes prior to injection of 1 \u00d7 107cells in 500\u00b5l of PBS on the outside of the left leg. \n\nTumour growth was assessed every 48 hr by direct calliper measurement in two \n\northogonal dimensions. Tumour volume was calculated using the formula: ?????? =\n\n1\n\n2\n(?????2 \u00d7 ???????). ILP was performed when tumours had a maximum diameter \n\nbetween 0.8 and 1.2 cm in all directions. Perfusion was performed for 13 min and washout \n\nfor 2 min. Transient limb dysfunction (in the form of decreased limb movement) usually \n\noccurred immediately after the procedure, \n\nbut full function in the perfused limb was seen within 2 hr of recovery. The therapeutic \n\ngroups consisted of six animals. \n\n - The ILP technique involved the cannulation of blood vessels. An incision was \n\nmade in the groin as shown in figure 4.2.a, the vessels were dissected and cannulated as \n\nshown in figure 4.2.b. The cannula were about 20cm long and were connected to the \n\nperfusion circuit. \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n130 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2.

Equipment Design: Cavitation Detection in conjunction with the VIFU system \n\n \n\n The VIFU 2000 is a pre-clinical HIFU (High Intensity Focused Ultrasound) \n\nsystem (Alpinion, Korea) uniquely designed for investigating a wide range of HIFU \n\napplications in small animals. This system enables users to undertake real time image \n\nguided research in projects such as ultrasound meditated drug delivery studies, ablation \n\nof solid tumors, and mechanical and cavitation effects in ex-vivo/in-vivo systems. \n\n No cavitation detection was possible with the system available, so it was necessary \n\nto design a holder for a PCD (that used for in vitro experiments, with the same detection \n\nsystem \u2013 see section 2.2.2). This was done with the help of the ICR Mechanical \n\nWorkshop. A picture of the holder is shown in Figure 4.3. \n\n \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n131 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3.

Calibration of the VIFU system \n\n \n\nAn attempt to calibrate the VIFU system was made using a micrometric gantry to \n\nmove a hydrophone in the ultrasound field.  This was needed because the VIFU system\u2019s \n\ngantry did not allow sufficiently accurate measurements. It was necessary to localise the \n\npeak of the ultrasound beam (as described in section 2.1.2) and once the peak had been \n\nfound, pressure data was acquired at 0.5mm intervals along one direction orthogonal to \n\nthe beam axis. It was found that the VIFU gantry did not reproducibly return to zero after \n\na scan, and so accurate beam plotting was not possible. However, the measurement using \n\nthe micrometric gantry was not perfect because a water tank was needed for coupling and \n\nso the gantry was positioned at a small angle to the transducer, and this led to less accurate \n\ncalibration of the system \u2013 this can be seen in figure 4.4. The focus was found and it can \n\nbe seen in figure 4.4 that a pressure peak is present. From figure 4.4 to figure 4.5, in terms \n\nof calibration, the transducer was rotated through 90\u00ba and the measurement was repeated \n\n\u2013 a flat top can be seen. This is because the beam was slightly displaced in this axis, with \n\nrespect to the hydrophone. \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n132 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4.

Treatment Planning \n\n \n\n \n\n The results in vitro have been used as a starting point to test whether there was an \n\neffect of ultrasound on viable cells, but the results cannot be compared to what happens \n\nin vivo due different factors including the aborption in tissue, higher temperature and \n\npresence of vasculature.  \n\n As a starting point, a dummy experiment was made on a dead rat and the coupling \n\nwas achieved using a water bag \u2013 see figure 4.7.A. The alignment of the cavitation \n\ndetection system was aligned with the HIFU focal region prior to experiments. The \n\nexposures started at peak negative pressure of 0.6 MPa.   The output was increased until \n\nsome signal was detected by the PCD. After a number of exposures it was decided to \n\ngroup the experiments into two exposure levels \u2013 \u201clow\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d pressure, i.e. the \n\nlowest pressure in which some reflections could be detected by the PCD and a higher \n\nlevel to test if there was a big difference in terms of viral uptake results. In the low \n\npressure cohort, 6 rats were exposed at 50W (~7MPa peak negative pressure at the focus) \n\nand  ... rats in the high pressure cohort, were treated with a 150W exposure (corresponding \n\nto ~10MPa peak negative pressure), with fixed parameters of  5% duty, 100 PRF and \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n134 \n\nultrasound frequency of 1.5 MHz. Figure 4.7 shows a part of the experimental set up for \n\nin vivo experiments. \n\n In this pilot study, 4 cohorts were defined as follows: \n\ni. Standard ILP alone \n\nii. Cohort 1 (ILP + 10% MB + FUS at 50W with TNF? in perfusate) \n\niii. Cohort 2 (ILP + 10% MB + FUS at 150W with TNF? in perfusate) \n\niv. Cohort 3 (ILP + 10% MB + FUS at 150W) \n\n \n\n In all the cohorts, 3 animals were euthanized 1h after treatment and the other 3, \n\n72h after the treatment. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.7.

Acoustic Pressure data from manufacturer as a function \n\nof Software Input Power can be seen in Table 1. As it was expected, there is a big \n\ndifference from what have been calibrated from Alpinion\u2019s calibration due to the fact that \n\nduring calibration, the hidrophone was slightly out of focus and in a 1 mm point, any \n\nslightly displacement makes a big difference. Previous calibration on the wet system, \n\nmade by a member of the therapeutic ultrasound team, proved that data from calibration \n\nis accurate when compared to in-house made calibration so, due to the impossibilty to \n\nperform an accurate measurement on the dry configuration and considering the fact that \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n135 \n\nthe transducers are identical, the values of pressure for the power levels used will be \n\naccording the manufacturer\u2019s calibration. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8.

In Vivo Experiments \n \n\n \n\nSample collection and storage \n\nThe animals were culled one hour and seventy-two hours following the procedure. The \n\ntumours were resected, weighed and snap frozen immediately. Tumour samples were \n\nhomogenised with PBS and protease inhibitors using a Precellys homogeniser. Cell lysis \n\nwas assisted by repeated freeze-thaw cycles. The samples were stored at -80\u00b0C. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n136 \n\nViral plaque assays \n\nCV-1 cells were grown to confluence on 24 well plates. The samples were thawed and \n\nthe supernatants were incubated on the CV-1 cells for 48 hours prior to viral detection. \n\nThe cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde/0.2%glutaraldehyde for 5 minutes then \n\nwashed with PBS and stained for 4 hours with X-gal staining buffer,  X-gal (1:100) and \n\nX-gal (1:1000). The cells were then washed with Ultra Filtered Water and dried. \n\nQuantitative PCR \n\nExpression of the A21L vaccinia gene was measured by qPCR using the Genelux GL-\n\nLC1 VV-A21L kit. DNA was prepared from the lysate of the tumour samples. A21L \n\nspecific primers were used (forward: 5\u2019-GTAAACTACAAACGTCTAAACAAGAA-3\u2019 \n\nand reverse: 5\u2019-CCTGGTATATCGTCTCTATCTTTATCAC-3\u2019). The viral copy \n\nnumber was then normalised by the weight of the tumour samples to give the number of \n\nviral copies per gram of tissue. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3. Results and Discussion of the In Vivo Study \n \n\n \n\n Successful results, in terms of reduced tumor growth and increased rat survival \n\ntime, using oncolytic virotherapy have highlighted the need to develop a treatment which \n\nincreases viral uptake, in which invasiveness is reduced, and where post-treatment \n\nsurgery would not be needed. In addressing this goal, this project focused on the study of \n\nthe combination of ILP and FUS in the presence of microbubbles to increase viral \n\npenetration of tumour bulk efficiency in Brown Norwegian rats transfected with BN175 \n\nfibrosarcoma cells.  \n\n The rats were prepared for ultrasound exposure\u2013 see Figures 4.9-4.11, cavitation \n\nwas detected during the experiments and then, the tumor tissue was analysed using \n\nhistochemical, qPCR and VPA assays. Organs such as lungs, heart and liver were also \n\ncollected to study the effectiveness of the tourniquet around the limb. Results from tumor \n\ntissue analysis and cavitation are presented below. \n\n \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n137 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.9. Brown Norwegian Rats were used for the in vivo experiments of the pilot study were anesthetized, operated \nin to cannulate the femoral artery and vessel \n\n \n\nFigure 4.10. Brown Norwegian Rats used for the in vivo experiments of this pilot study were positioned on the VIFU \n2000 operating table, a water bag filled in with degassed water was placed on top . \n\n \n\nFigure 4.11. After the experiments, the rats were sutured, kept in a cage and medicated to minimise any suffering and \neither 1 or 72h post experiment, they were euthanized and the tumor and organs have been collected and stored to \nlater analysis. \n\n \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n138 \n\n The results of the quantitative PCR for the tumour samples suggest that FUS has \n\nnot added anything in terms of viral copy numbers \u2013 see Figure 4.12. Apart from the \n\ncohort without TNF-?, the viral copy number does not increase with time as was hoped. \n\nAs there is a lack of information about how the virus responds to FUS, a possible \n\nexplanation could be that the virus is being destroyed or damaged by the ultrasound. The \n\nviral copy number on PCR goes down from 1 hour to 72 hours in the HIFU cohorts, which \n\nmay suggest that the virus is damaged, or at least not able to replicate. Overall it looks as \n\nif FUS may be having a negative effect. The viral plaque assays (VPAs) reveal live virus \n\nthat is still able to replicate, rather than just the amount of viral DNA (which is measured \n\nby qPCR assesses). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.12. Expression of the A21L vaccinia gene as measured by qPCR using the Genelux GL-LC1 VV-A21L kit. The \nviral copy number was normalised using the weight of the tumour samples to give the number of viral copies per gram \nof tissue. \n\n \n\n In this assay, cell monolayers are infected with a low ratio of virus, such that only \n\nsporadic cells become infected. Each group of infected cells is referred to as a plaque. \n\nUninfected cells surround the plaques. After several infection cycles, the infected cells in \n\nthe center of the plaques begin to lyse and the peripheral infected cells remain surrounded \n\nby uninfected cells. This phenomenon causes the light passing through the infected cells \n\nto refract differently from the surrounding uninfected cells, and the plaque can be \n\nvisualized either by the naked eye or by light microscopy. Each plaque represents a single \n\nvirus. Individual plaques obtained from different dilutions of a viral stock can be counted \n\nto determine the viral titer (pfu/ml) of a given transfection or virus stock. In this study, \n\nthe viral plaques from the tumour samples have not grown any significant amount of \n\n1 \nh\no\nu\nr\n\n72\n h\n\no\nu\nr\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\nTime from procedure\n\nV\nir\n\na\nl \nc\n\no\np\n\nie\ns\n\n/g\nra\n\nm Standard ILP\n\nHIFU 50\n\nHIFU 150\n\nHIFU 150 w/o TNF\n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n139 \n\nvirus, and grew only from the viral stock used for the perfusions (used as a positive control \n\nfor the plaques). Some pictures from the VPAs can be seen in figure 4.13.   \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.13. Pictures from the VPAs of two different cohorts \u2013 a cohort without exposure to ultrasound (Standard ILP) \nand a cohort with the combined treatment at 150W of exposure. There are three wells per sample. The first well is the \nundiluted lysate from the tumour (Neat)  followed by 1 in 100 and 1 in 1000 dilutions of the lysate. The positive control \nis the stock of virus  used at the same dilution for each perfusion. \n\n \n\n As can be seen in Figure 4.13, plaques are only visible on the positive control. \n\nThis suggests that the virus could be killed by the US or by other means, including lack \n\nof perfusion access into the limb and therefore lack of virus. The yield from the VPAs \n\nwas too small for a comparison between cohorts, and so does not provide any usable data \n\nand . It would be good to have histology data to see whether there was ultrasound damage \n\nin the tissue but the staining for X-gal did not work either. X-gal staining is a rapid and \n\nconvenient histochemical technique used to detect ?-galactosidase activity - used in \n\nmolecular biology as a reporter marker to monitor gene expression The presence of an \n\nactive ?-galactosidase produces a characteristic blue dye which provides a means of \n\ndistinguishing the presence of an active/live virus. \n\n For the purpose of this in vivo study and contrary to what has been done in vitro, \n\npulsed exposures have been used to avoid the rise in temperature in situ. So, both in the \n\nlow (50 W) and high (150W) cohort, the exposure duration has been 10 s in each point \n\nwith a PRF of 100 Hz and 5% DC. This introduced an issue in terms of cavitation \n\nprocessing because the script used to process recorded data analysed in Chapter 2 was \n\nprepared to process continuous data. Using the same script for pulsed data would be a \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n140 \n\nproblem because of the discontinuities in between pulses \u2013 off time data would be \n\nregarded as if a signal would have been acquired. The modifications in the processing \n\nscript have been made with the help of Dr. John Civale, a member of the Therapeutic \n\nUltrasound Team in the Institute of Cancer Research. The signal was divided into \n\nsegments and in each segment, everytime the signal was above a defined threshold, the \n\nsignal would be processed in consecutive segments until the signal would below the \n\ndefined threshold.  \n\n The results from the cavitation detection have been summarized and can be seen \n\nin Tables 2-4, representing the results by cohort. In these tables, the first row identifies in \n\nwhich rat the experiment was made. A total of 23 rats have been used in a random way, \n\ni.e. the experiments started with rat 1 (rats 1-6 have been used to define the conditions to \n\nthen start the main experiments) and in each day of experiments, it was tried to operate \n\nin rats from different cohorts to guarantee that the experience gained from experiment to \n\nexperiment would not interfer in the results. All the tumors were exposed 45 times to 10 \n\ns of ultrasound in 5 grids of 9 points in different positions on the tumor, and cavitation \n\ndata has been acquired during each exposure.  \n\n The summary present in Tables 2-4 show the percentage of exposures in each rat \n\nthat allowed the detection of the effect described in each row. As it was already discussed, \n\nthe term harmonic refers to frequencies that are integral multiples of the frequency of the \n\ntransmitted pulse (which is also called the fundamental frequency or first harmonic). The \n\npresence of half or ultra harmonics is linked to nonlinear propagation and stable cavitation \n\nand the detection of these phenomena is present in the second and third rows of Tables 2-\n\n4. Forth and fifth columns have to due with the detection of inertial cavitation \u2013 a first \n\nlook at recorded data in the time domain would be used to choose time points of highest \n\namplitude compared to noise level (two or three point have been used to further analyses) \n\nand then through FFT on these time points, an elevation in FFT would be regarded as \n\ninertial cavitation everytime there was a broadband of signal above the threshold as \n\ndefined in Chapter 2.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n141 \n\nTable 2 - Summary of the information collected from cavitation data processing and \n\nanalysis of Cohort 1 \n\nRat 9 11 20 6 13 15 \n\nHalf Harmonic (%) 20.0 95.6 20.0 4.44 55.6 4.44 \n\nUltraharmonics (%) 11.1 66.7 13.3 0.00 22.2 4.44 \n\nSuspicious BB Level (%) 31.1 40.0 0.00 57.8 82.2 4.44 \n\nElevation in FFT above threshold (%) 26.7 66.7 17.8 48.9 60.0 37.8 \nTable 2.

Cavitation detection was performed during all the exposures but in rats 18 and 16 it \nfailed once and in rat 17 the cannula moved and only 3 grids were completed. \n  \n\n One of the first things to comment on when looking at Tables 2-4 is the huge \n\nvariation between thenumber of exposures in which cavitation is detected. Data acquired \n\nrequired a close inspection to decide whether inertial cavitation was present or not \u2013 data \n\nwas analysed both in the time and frequency domain as described in section 2.2. \n\n In Table 2, there is a summary of the results of cavitation detection of cohort 1 in \n\nwhich the tumor was exposed at a peak negative pressure of approximately -7 MPa during \n\nIsolated Limb Perfusion with 10% SonoVue microbubbles in the perfusate containing \n\nTNF-?, Melphalan and Vaccinia Virus. A probable detection of broadband of 42.9 \u00b1 \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n142 \n\n19.0% is associated with this cohort. This cohort comprised in 3 rats in which the organs \n\nwere collected 1h post-experiment, and 3 rats in which the collection was made 72h after \n\nexposure. The broadband detection in these two sub-groups is considered to be present in  \n\n37.1 \u00b1 26.0% and 48.8 \u00b1 11.1%, respectively. If we look at Figure 108, we see that the \n\namount of virus detected in the 1h collection rats is higher than the amount detected in \n\nthe 72h collection rats.  \n\n Table 2 summarizes the results of cavitation detection for cohort 2 in which the \n\ntumor was exposed at a peak negative pressure of approximately -11 MPa during Isolated \n\nLimb Perfusion with 10% SonoVue microbubbles in the perfusate containing TNF-?, \n\nMelphalan and Vaccinia Virus. In this cohort, there is a detection of broadband of 60.6 \u00b1 \n\n24.8%. This cohort also comprises 3 rats with organ collection 1h post-experiment and 3 \n\nrats in which the organ collection was 72h post-experiment. The broadband detection is \n\nconsidered to be present in  57.8 \u00b1 36.8% and 63.3 \u00b1 12.8%, respectively. In Figure 108, \n\nwe see that the amount of virus detected in the 1h collection rats is higher than that \n\ndetected in the 72h collection rats.  \n\n In Table 3, there is information from cavitation detection for cohort 3 in which the \n\ntumor was exposed at a peak negative pressure of approximately -11 MPa under Isolated \n\nLimb Perfusion with 10% SonoVue microbubbles in the perfusate containing only \n\nMelphalan and Vaccinia Virus (without TNF-?).  In the 6 rats of the cohort, there is a \n\ndetection of broadband of 67.4 \u00b1 19.1%. This cohort also comprises 3 rats of 1h collection \n\npost-experiment and 3 rats in which the collection was made 72h post-experiment. The \n\nbroadband detection is in  65.4 \u00b1 11.7% and 69.5 \u00b1 27.6%, respectively, in these two \n\ngroups. In Figure 108, we see that the amount of virus detected in the 1h collection rats \n\nis lower than the amount detected in the 72h collection rats.  \n\n The analysis Table by Table suggests that the higher probability of the occurence \n\nof inertial cavitation is directly associated with the amount of virus detected 1h post \n\ncollection \u2013 see Figure 4.12 -  but more experiments would be needed to have enough \n\ndata for concrete conclusions, although there is a \u201ctrend\u201d. When it comes to the data from \n\nthe 72h collection, this trend may also be found but there is a big difference between the \n\ncohorst with and without TNF-? present \u2013 is TNF-? toxic not only for the tumor but also \n\nfor the virus? This is an important question that would be an advantage for a future clinical \n\naplication \u2013 the increased efficacy of oncolytic virus in the absence of TNF-? would \n\ngreatly reduce the toxicity of a combined therapy including, for example, FUS, Melphalan \n\nand Vaccinia Virus or only FUS and Vaccinia Virus. \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n143 \n\n Figures 4.14-4.16, show examples of the traces from processed cavitation data in \n\nwhich it is possible to detect broadband, half harmonic or ultra harmonics.

This would also affect the distance traveled by the \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n146 \n\nultrasound beam to reach the tumor; additionaly, different rats may have different \n\nvasculature distribution and this also influences not only the attenuation of the ultrasound \n\nbeam, the amount of reflected signal heard by the PCD, but also the perfusion rate and \n\nnumber of microbubbles that get into the limb.   \n\n Another point to consider is the positioning of the rat was not fixed from \n\nexperiment to experiment although a great effort was made to have each rat in a similar \n\nposition; finally, the detection was allways dependent on the position of the PCD with \n\nrespect to the tumor, and it is possible that the detection zone of the PCD was not allways \n\nable to hear the scatter from the tumor. It is important to remember that broadband \n\ndetection only means that it was of sufficient amplitude for the system to hear it, but \n\nabsence of a detected signal does not mean there was no cavitation. The deeper the \n\nultrasound is fired into tissue, the less signal is detected. Conversely, if target is \n\nsuperficial, and there is cavitation in the water as it regassed and/or heated, significant \n\namounts of cavitation activity can be detected, but may not come from within the tumour \n\n(imaging is good for showing cavitation in the water bath, but it had to  be turned off \n\nbecause it interfered with cavitation detection when on). Imaging data acquired in the \n\nbeginning and end of the exposure is of some help to compare how the depth of the target \n\ncould have influenced the cavitation detection. Some of these images are shown in \n\nFigures 4.17-4.19. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n147 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.17. Ultrasound Imaging acquired in the prior (left)  and post (right) exposure to ultrasound on rats 9 , 11 and \n20 from cohort 1. The images were acquired using the E-Cube 9 provided with the VIFU system with a phased array \ntransducer working at 10 MHz. The yellow cross marks the starting point of the treatment \u2013 the initial target. Then, a \ngrid of 9 points centred on this point was exposed.. In each grid, the exposure were created  from left to right in three \nrows of three points. \n\n \n\n If the variability in cavitation detection could be explained by the differences in \n\nthe depth of treatment in cohort 1, one would expect that rat 20 would give the poorer \n\ndata because, , the treatment starting point is deeper than in rats 9 and 11. Similar results \n\nwould be expected for rats 9 and 11 \u2013 see Figure 4.17. From Table 2, the detection of, for \n\nexample, half harmonic in rats 9, 11 and 20 is of approximately 20, 95.6 and 20% and in \n\nterms of broadband detection the values at 26.7, 66.7 and 17.8%, respectively. This is \n\ncounter to the hypothesis about the depth of treatment, and the same is true for the three \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n148 \n\nexamples from cohort 2 \u2013 see Figure 4.18. For rats 10 and 12, the depth of treatment is \n\nsimilar and, as can be seen in Table 3, for these rats the half harmonic detection rates are \n\nof 25.6 and 100% and  32.6 and 100% for broadband. In cohort 3, from the three examples \n\nchosen, rat 22 should give the better results in terms of cavitation detection because the \n\ntreatment is more superficial but this is also not the case \u2013 see Figure 4.19 and Table 4. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.18.

The assays available only detect the amount of live virus in the \n\ntumors and also because it was not possible to study in vitro the consequences of the \n\nexposure of Vaccinia Virus to ultrasound. The histochemical analysis would be needed \n\nto analyse the level of damage in the tissue, if there was any, and then, it could be proved \n\nif the virus did not replicate in the tumor because either the virus or the tissue have been \n\ndestroyed. \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n150 \n\n5. Conclusions and Future Work \n \n\n \n This project was a pilot study in which Focused Ultrasound and Microbubbles \n\nwere added to a combined therapy, which includes Melphalan, TNF-? and Vaccinia \n\nVirus, to try to enhance the efficacy, and to reduce the toxicity of the treatment. This work \n\ninvolves the calibration of equipment, detection of cavitation thresholds, and in vitro and \n\nin vivo experiments with BN175 rat sarcoma line. The in vitro experiments were carried \n\nout to test the combined therapy in the presence or absence of (i) focused ultrasound and \n\n(ii) microbubbles, with different exposure parameters, such as peak rarefactional focal \n\npressures, duty cycle, pulse repetition frequency, exposure duration and microbubble \n\nconcentration.  Finally, in vivo experiments in Brown Norwegian rats were conducted to \n\nhelp to determine the effectiveness of this combined therapy using Focused Ultrasound \n\nin the presence of Microbubbles, Melphalan, TNF-? and Vaccinia Virus, and Isolated \n\nLimb Perfusion. The main conclusions on the work carried out are summarised here. \n\n The cavitation thresholds study was performed i) to study the difference in \n\nthresholds for different transducer frequencies, ii) to choose the levels of pressure for in \n\nvitro exposures, iii) to decide on the best frequency to use when microbubbles were \n\npresent (that being the one closest to the resonant frequency of the microbubbles).  \n\n The main conclusions from this study are that the microbubbles resonate at a lower \n\nl evel of peak negative pressure at the frequency of 1.34 MHz than what happens at 1.66 \n\nMHz in the absence of microbubbles. This may be because of the condition of the medium \n\nat the time of exposure. Differences in the quantity of dissolved gases and temperature \n\nare the main things that could affect the results.  The samples had to be prepared in a cell \n\nculture room and then transferred to a physics lab to be exposed. Another factor that could \n\nexplain this result has to do with the resonant frequency of the microbubbles. A study of \n\nthe SonoVue Microbubbles used reported its resonant frequency to be 1.6, 2.1 and 3.1 \n\nMHz for bubbles of 4.0, 3.2 and 2.6 \u00b5m, respectively. It is also stated that the mean \n\ndiameter of the microbubbles is 2.5\u00b5m, 90% are smaller than 6\u00b5m and 99% smaller than \n\n11\u00b5m. Looking at this data, we could say that bigger bubbles are resonant  at lower \n\nfrequencies and so, in the sample tested, a large number of bubbles could be bigger than \n\n4.0 \u00b5m.  \n\n Interestingly, at each drive frequency, the cavitation threshold lay in the same \n\npressure interval, and so a general conclusion could be made about the influence of the \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n151 \n\nmicrobubbles on the cavitation threshold \u2013 the percentage of microbubbles dissolved in a \n\ncertain amount of medium does not seem to change the threshold to get cavitation. At the \n\ncavitation threshold, at any given frequency, in the presence of microbubbles, the \n\namplitude of the cavitational events detected is similar for the three frequencies. As it was \n\nnecessary to choose between 1.34 MHz and 1.66 MHz, in order to be closer to the \n\nfrequency used in vivo, 1.66 MHz seemed to be a better choice because the data suggests \n\nthat at this frequency, broadband was maximised and the main goal is to achieve inertial \n\ncavitation. Accurate measurements must be made if a quantitative rather qualitative \n\nanalysis is required. \n\n As appreciation summary of the in vitro study, it seems that treatment of the cells \n\nwith ultrasound only, or of ultrasound with 1% microbubble concentration, has no effect. \n\nHowever, when a 10 % concentration of microbubbles is used  there are two interesting \n\nthings: i) there is a reduction in cell viability immediately after treatment irrespective of \n\nacoustic pressure used, ii) medium and high pressures with microbubbles kill the cells, \n\nbut no cell killing is seen with low pressure and microbubbles. As a result, cells treated \n\nwith low pressure and 10% microbubbles start proliferating again and by day 3 they reach \n\ncontrol viability. The rest of the treatments do not seem to affect the cells, so the \n\ndifferences in between measurements can be regarded as experimental variation. \n\n As most of these results are reproducible, they were useful for this study whose \n\npurpose is to open up cells and cell junctions without actually killing them. It shows that \n\nlow pressure and high concentration of microbubbles will affect the cells immediately \n\nafter treatment but not actually kill them. \n\n  The results from FACS analysis are important in that they allow a distinction to \n\nbe drawn between populations with and without PI for unexposed, \u2018low\u2019 and \u2018high\u2019 \n\nexposure controls \u2013 the detection of PI inside the cells, in a living population, is increases \n\nas the exposure is raised. This could suggest that there is an increased permeabilization \n\nof the membranes that allow the PI to get inside the cells. \n\n This project focused on the study of the combination of ILP and FUS, in the \n\npresence of microbubbles, to increase viral penetration efficiency in tumour bulk in \n\nBrown Norwegian rats transfected with BN175 fibrosarcoma cells.  \n\n The results of the quantitative PCR for the tumour samples suggest that FUS has \n\nadded nothing in terms of viral copy numbers.  As there is a lack of information of how \n\nthe virus responds to FUS, a possible explanation could be that the virus is destroyed, or \n\ndamaged by, the ultrasound. The results of the viral plaque assays should help to explain \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n152 \n\nthis situation as this assay quantifies live virus that remains able to replicate, rather than \n\njust the amount of viral DNA (which is what qPCR assesses).  \n\n The VPAs showed that plaques could only be seen on the positive control. This \n\nsuggests that the virus had been killed by the US, or by another mechanis), including a \n\nlack of perfusion access into the limb, and therefore lack of virus. The yield from the \n\nVPAs was too small too allow a comparison between cohorts, so does not provide any \n\nusable data. It would be good to have histology data to see whether there was ultrasound \n\ndamage in the tissue, but the staining for X-gal did not work well.    \n\n The analysis of cavitation data shows a huge variation in terms of results both \n\nfrom different cohorts, and within the same cohort \u2013 this proves how unpredictable and \n\nunstable cavitation detection can be - more experiments are needed to have enough data \n\nto draw reliable conclusions. The difficulty found while trying to get the cavitation \n\ndetection system working properly was definitely one of the main reasons for the poor \n\nresults seen. As discussed before, the in vivo factors that could have reduced the quality \n\nof cavitation detection in different rats, could have been differences in the size of the legs, \n\nand in the time taken to place the cannula to get the perfusion working. Possible \n\ndifferences in vasculature, different positioning of the rat from experiment to experiment, \n\nand the fact that the detection was dependent on the position of the PCD relative to the \n\ntumor are factors that have a negative influence on the quality of cavitation detection.  It \n\nis important to remember that detecting broadband just means there was enough for the \n\nsystem to \u201chear\u201d it, but that its absence does not mean there was no cavitation. \n\n \u201cWhat could have been done better in this project?\u201d or \u201cWhat should be done \n\nnext?\u201d are important questions to ask when we are discussing a pilot project on any topic. \n\nOne of the main issues on this project was the lack of time to learn, and put into practice \n\nall the new concepts needed to perform in vitro and in vivo experiments on such a new \n\ntopic as ultrasound assisted oncolytic virotherapy.  \n\n A lot of burocracy is involved in getting authorization to experiment on viral \n\nsamples, and this was not achieved during the project\u2019s timetable. Also, if there had been \n\nmore time, it would have been important to do at least 5 repeats for each condition on test \n\n(PNP, PRF, DC and DE), instead of only 3, in order to be more certain about the \n\nreproducibility of the experiments. Adding to this, more levels in each condition should \n\nhave been tested to have a better understanding of any trend that could have been present, \n\nbut a choice of quality over quantity had to be made \u2013 during the project\u2019s timescale, it \n\nwas crucial to have better, rather than more, data. Then, in terms of the experiment itself, \n\n\n\nUltrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies \n\n____________________________________________________________ \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n153 \n\nit would have been better to have a different well plate configuration to avoid the \n\ncontamination of the sample due to the entrance of non-sterile degassed water through \n\nthe channels around the wells. Although a big effort has been made to decontaminate the \n\nwell plate prior to manipulation inside the hood, this could explain some of the variation \n\npresent in the results. Another issue for the experiments in vitro is the fact that the \n\ntransducer used was not being driven at the same drive frequency as the transducer used \n\nin vivo. Despite the differences between the two scenarios, it is allways important to have \n\na means of comparison when we need to translate what we see in vitro to the experiments \n\ndone in vivo.  \n\n There is need to find a way to have a fixed position for the rat for the in vivo \n\nexperiments, to minimise the variation in the path travelled by the ultrasound beam until \n\nits target, and to re-design the cavitation detection system to guarantee detection in the \n\nsame direction in any experiment. A ring passive cavitation detector would be a suitable \n\noption because it would allways be aligned with the ultrasound beam. More animals in \n\neach cohort are required for better quantitative analysis. Despite the poor detection in \n\nterms of cavitation detection, a lower value of peak negative pressure should have been \n\nused and must be tested to see if there are better results in terms of the enhanced uptake \n\nof virus into the tumor bulk. \n\n It is worth repeating the experiments performed for the purpose of this thesis \n\nbecause the combined therapy including Melphalan, TNF-? and Vaccinia Virus seemed \n\nto have potential to increase efficacy and reduce toxicity of the treatment.  The parameters \n\nof the ultrasound beam used seem to have no negative effect on cell viability even in the \n\npresence of microbubbles so there is the need to prove that this can also improve the \n\npermeability of cell membrane to virus with in vitro experiments. Once this is done, \n\nexperiments in vivo must be repeated under different conditions to confirm that the \n\nefficacy of the combined therapy can be enhanced.  \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n154 \n\n \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n \n\n1.
