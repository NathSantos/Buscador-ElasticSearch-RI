Os EUA com seu etanol de milho e o Brasil \n\ncom sua etanol de cana, s\u00e3o os dois maiores produtores mundiais de etanol (1\u00ba EUA; 2\u00ba \n\nBrasil) e tem competido pela participa\u00e7\u00e3o de mercado mundial h\u00e1 d\u00e9cadas. A partir de \n\nDezembro de 2011, os EUA levantaram as tarifas e os subs\u00eddios que foram instalados para \n\nproteger sua ind\u00fastria de etanol, o que muda o campo de jogo da produ\u00e7\u00e3o mundial de etanol \n\npara o futuro. Atualmente em todo o mundo, o etanol \u00e9 usado em uma propor\u00e7\u00e3o muito menor \n\ncomparativamente a outros combust\u00edveis. Esta pesquisa analisa o n\u00edvel potencial de \n\ncolabora\u00e7\u00e3o entre os EUA e o Brasil, facilitando um di\u00e1logo entre os stakeholders em etanol. \n\nA pesquisa consiste principalmente de conversas e entrevistas, com base em um conjunto de \n\nperguntas destinadas a inspirar conversas detalhadas e expansivas sobre os temas de rela\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nBrasil-EUA e etanol. Esta pesquisa mostra que o etanol celul\u00f3sico, que \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m conhecido \n\ncomo etanol de segunda gera\u00e7\u00e3o, oferece mais oportunidades de parceria entre os EUA e o \n\nBrasil, como h\u00e1 mais oportunidades para pesquisa e desenvolvimento em conjunto e \n\ntransfer\u00eancia de tecnologia nesta \u00e1rea. Enquanto o etanol de cana no Brasil ainda \u00e9 uma \n\nind\u00fastria pr\u00f3spera e crescente, o milho e a cana s\u00e3o muito diferentes geneticamente para \n\naplicar as mesmas inova\u00e7\u00f5es exatas de um etanol de primeira gera\u00e7\u00e3o, por outro. As \n\nsemelhan\u00e7as entre os processos de fermenta\u00e7\u00e3o e destila\u00e7\u00e3o entre as mat\u00e9rias-primas \n\nutilizadas nos EUA e no Brasil para o etanol de segunda gera\u00e7\u00e3o torna o investimento \n\nconjunto nesta \u00e1rea mais sens\u00edvel. De segunda gera\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 uma resposta para a quest\u00e3o \n\n\"alimentos versus combust\u00edveis\". Esta pesquisa aplica o modelo de co-opeti\u00e7\u00e3o como um \n\nquadro de parceria entre os EUA e o Brasil em etanol celul\u00f3sico. A pesquisa mostra que \n\nenquanto o etanol pode n\u00e3o ser um forte concorrente com o petr\u00f3leo no futuro imediato, ele \n\ntem melhores perspectivas de ser desenvolvido como um complemento ao petr\u00f3leo, em vez de \n\num substituto. Como os EUA e o Brasil tem culturas de misturar etanol com petr\u00f3leo, algo da \n\nestrutura para isso j\u00e1 est\u00e1 em vigor, a rela\u00e7\u00e3o de complementaridade seria fortalecido atrav\u00e9s \n\nde uma pol\u00edtica de governo clara e de longo prazo. A pesquisa sugere que apenas atrav\u00e9s \n\ndesta colabora\u00e7\u00e3o, com toda a partilha de conhecimentos t\u00e9cnicos e estrat\u00e9gias econ\u00f4micas e \n\nde desenvolvimento, o etanol celul\u00f3sico ser\u00e1 um commodity negociado mundialmente e uma \n\nalternativa vi\u00e1vel a outros combust\u00edveis. As entrevistas com os interessados em que esta \n\npesquisa se baseia foram feitas ao longo de 2012. Como a ind\u00fastria de etanol \u00e9 muito \n\ndin\u00e2mica, certos eventos podem ter ocorrido desde esse tempo para modificar ou melhorar \n\nalguns dos argumentos apresentados. \n\n \n\nPalavras Chave: Etanol, Biocombust\u00edveis, EUA, Brasil, Rela\u00e7\u00f5es Internacionais, Co-\nopeti\u00e7\u00e3o \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nAbstract \n\n \n\n Ethanol production and the domination of the industry has historically been a source \n\nof contention for its two main producers. The USA with its corn ethanol and Brazil with its \n\nsugarcane ethanol are the first and second largest worldwide producers of ethanol and have \n\ncompeted for global market share for decades. As of December of 2011, the USA lifted \n\nlongstanding tariffs and subsidies that were installed to protect the US ethanol industry, which \n\nchanges the playing field of global ethanol production for the future. Currently in the world, \n\nethanol is used in a comparatively much smaller proportion to other fuels. This research \n\nanalyzes the potential level of collaboration between the USA and Brazil by studying and \n\nfacilitating the dialogue between key stakeholders in ethanol. The research consists mainly of \n\ninteractive conversations, based on a set of questions designed to inspire detailed and \n\nexpansive conversations on the topics of US-Brazilian Relations and Ethanol. This research \n\nshows that cellulosic ethanol, which is also known as second-generation ethanol, provides \n\nmore opportunities for partnership between the US and Brazil as there are more opportunities \n\nfor joint Research and Development and technology transfer in this area. While sugarcane \n\nethanol in Brazil is still a thriving and growing industry, corn and sugarcane are too \n\ngenetically disparate to apply the same exact innovations of one first-generation ethanol on \n\nthe other. The similarities in the fermentation and distillation processes between the raw \n\nmaterials used in the US and Brazil for second-generation ethanol makes joint investment in \n\nthis area more sensible. Second-generation is an answer to the food vs. fuel issue. This \n\nresearch applies the co-opetition model as a framework of partnership between the US and \n\nBrazil in cellulosic ethanol. The research shows that while ethanol may not be a strong \n\ncompetitor with petroleum in the immediate future, it has better prospects of being developed \n\nas a complement to petroleum rather than a substitute. As the US and Brazil have ethanol-\n\npetroleum mixing cultures some of the structure for this is already in place, the \n\ncomplementary relationship would be fortified through clear and long term government \n\npolicy. The research suggests that only through this collaboration, with all the sharing of \n\ntechnical expertise and economic and developmental strategies, will cellulosic ethanol be a \n\nworld traded commodity and viable alternative to other fuels. The stakeholder interviews on \n\nwhich this research is based were done throughout 2012. As the ethanol industry is very \n\ndynamic, certain events may have occurred since this time to modify or enhance some of the \n\narguments presented.  \n\n \n\nKey Words: Ethanol, Biofuels, USA, Brazil, International Relations, Co-opetition \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 7 \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\n \n\nAlthough I received support from Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Getulio Vargas and Columbia University \n\nas a whole, I will highlight a few distinct individuals who went above and beyond to provide \n\ninvaluable assistance and guidance throughout every step of this process.  From FGV, I would \n\nlike to thank Professor Jaci Correa Leite, my thesis advisor and mentor. Thank you for your \n\nattention to detail and adherence to excellence.  I would also like to thank Professor Moises \n\nSznifer, who invited me to work with his company on this project. You were an invaluable \n\nmentor and great teacher. Thank you for being a true collaborator and helping structure the \n\nformat of the interviews, organize the Forum, meeting with me biweekly, and countless other \n\nassistance. I would like to give a special thanks to Professor Ricardo Ratner Rochman for his \n\ncontributions, which helped me deepen my research. I also would like to thank Eliene Soares \n\nda Silva from the International Office and Professor Gilberto Sarfati for providing all the \n\ncritical information on formatting and structure.  \n\n I would like to especially thank all who were interviewed, as part of the research for \n\nthis thesis, for their time and patience.  Thank you Professor Albert Fishlow for not only \n\nproviding me with my first interview for this research, but also agreeing to be the keynote \n\nspeaker of the Forum and pointing me in the right direction for my literature review.  Your \n\nparticipation in this Forum and thesis gave this work just the push it needed and challenged \n\nme to think more creatively. I would like to thank Professor Thomas Trebat for the wealth of \n\npractical experience that he brought, Chris Somerville for his technological and research \n\nbased perspective, Luis Roberto Pogetti for broadening the way I looked at the relationship \n\nbetween petroleum and ethanol, Tadeu Andrade for giving me a better understanding of how \n\nethanol is expanding outside the USA and Brazil, and Roberto de Rezende Barbosa for \n\nhelping me better understand the role of politics in the successful development of ethanol. \n\nI would like to especially thank my loving husband for supporting me through this \n\nentire process and encouraging me to pursue this area beyond the work of this thesis. Thank \n\nyou for helping me map routes to my meetings here in S\u00e3o Paulo, for staying up late to help \n\nme proofread and format the text, and for always being on the lookout for articles that \n\npertained to my research.

This work is focused on analyzing the potential for ethanol cooperation between the \n\nUSA and Brazil, the two largest global producers of ethanol, through organizing the First \n\nInternational Forum on Biofuels. The congress will take place at The University of Miami \n\nand will be organized mainly through a partnership between the Idea Consulting Group and \n\nthe University of Miami. This thesis will be done in collaboration with Idea and will involve \n\norganizing the event and actively researching while participating in the planning and \n\ndialogue. This thesis will explore the potential for cooperation between the USA and Brazil \n\nand identify major stumbling blocks for a mutually beneficial ethanol partnership. The \n\nresearch before the Forum includes interviewing six Forum participants in the months leading \n\nup to the congress. The three from Brazil are Luis Roberto Pogetti, Roberto de Rezende \n\nBarbosa, and Tadeu Andrade and the three from the USA are Albert Fishlow, Chris \n\nSomerville, and Thomas Trebat.  \n\nSome of the major Brazilian stakeholders which have already agreed to participate in \n\nthe Forum or are being mobilized include Petrobras, the Brazilian Development Bank \n\n(BNDES), the Brazilian Sugarcane Industry Association (UNICA), Sugarcane Technology \n\nCenter (CTC), Bunge, Copersucar, Cosan, Ministerio do Desenvolvimento, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio \n\nVargas (FGV), Foundation for Research Support of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo (FAPESP), \n\netc. Some of the major American stakeholders who have already agreed to participate in the \n\nForum or are being mobilized are Cargill, Dow, Dupont, Energy Biosciences Institute (EBI), \n\nthe University of California Berkeley, Columbia University, the University of Miami, the \n\nSecretary of Energy/Agriculture, etc. Albert Fishlow, one of the most well renowned scholars \n\nin Brazilian-American relations, has agreed to be the keynote speaker.  \n\nThe object of the Forum is to promote a partnership and the object of the thesis is to \n\nqualitatively observe the potential of partnership by assessing the opinions and commentary \n\nof the stakeholders who can facilitate or deride a partnership. The method for analysis will be \n\nAction Research. The thesis will not compare benefits or disadvantages of ethanol vs. other \n\nfuels; it will only focus on the partnership and collaboration of the USA and Brazil in the \n\ndevelopment of ethanol as a competitive alternative to other fuels. \n\n\n\n 13 \n\n2 Background: Why is this important right now? \n\n2.1 Global Context \n\nRecently, there has been series of events that have drawn attention to ethanol and \n\nwhether it can gain steam as a world-class commodity or whether it will die on the vine. \n\nWorld leaders have demonstrated their interests in finding ways to become less dependent on \n\nfossil fuels and consequently less vulnerable to major oil producing countries. However the \n\ndiscovery of new petroleum reserves off the coast of Brazil and in the Unites States has \n\ncaused widespread excitement, possibly leading to less urgency in the research and \n\ndevelopment of ethanol. \n\nThere still remains long standing argument that there is a depletion of world petroleum \n\nreserve and the need to find alternative fuels to sustain world industry, however many believe \n\nthat petroleum is not going anywhere.  So it is a time to analyze the real payoff for investing \n\nin the ethanol industry and how can it grow in a world where petroleum still holds power.  \n\n Another interesting factor about the present time is that the USA and Brazil are \n\nexperiencing a combination of unique international relations. Brazil is an emerging power and \n\nthe USA is looking to it with what seems to be a newfound respect and strategy. Leaders seem \n\nto be laying the groundwork for a new type of relations that is marked by unique equality and \n\nmuch of the dialogue has highlighted the mutual interest of the two in developing biofuels. In \n\nMarch 2011, President Barack Obama made a trip to Brazil and spoke about the need for the \n\nUSA and Brazil to establish a meaningful partnership in respect to ethanol to replace the \n\nworld\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels.  \n\nPerhaps due to the 2008 economic downturn and also to Brazil\u2019s recent economic \n\nsuccess, the USA has modified its approach to being more partnership-oriented approach in \n\nits relations with Brazil. This was highlighted in Obama\u2019s rhetoric on his 2011 visit to Brazil. \n\nObama expressed a need for partnership between the USA and Brazil in regards to ethanol \n\nand made the issue about replacing fossil fuel usage with ethanol as a global necessity for the \n\nfuture.  He had previously expressed his support of biofuels in his 2008 campaign and later in \n\nhis reelection speech in 2012. \n\n \n\n\u201cThe only long-term solution to the world\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels is clean energy \n\ntechnology, and that is why the United States and Brazil are deepening our cooperation on \n\nbiofuels, and why we\u2019re launching a U.S.-Brazil Green Economy Partnership. Because we \n\n\n\n 14 \n\nknow that the development of clean energy is one of the best ways to create new jobs and \n\nindustries in both our nations. \u201d \n\nPresident Barack Obama \u2013 March 19, 2011 \n\nBrazil-U.S. Business Summit \n\n \n\nTaking a cue from this Presidential initiative, the University of Miami has teamed up \n\nwith the Idea Consulting Firm (based in Sao Paulo) to organize the First International \n\nForum on Biofuels that will take place in Florida in April 2013. Many key stakeholders, \n\nincluding former Brazilian presidential candidate Marina Silva, have committed to speak and \n\nparticipate in the event. As part of the research and organization leading up to the forum, six \n\nof the participants of the forum were interviewed about various aspects of US-Brazil relation \n\nand ethanol.  The contents of these interviews will be used by the Idea Consulting Firm and \n\nthe University of Miami to help build constructive discussion on how to build a win-win \n\nsituation for both countries in ethanol and what this scenario would look like for stakeholders \n\nfrom each country.  \n\n2.2 Viability and Current Production \n\nAt this point, ethanol is not being fully used in a manner that indicates that it is a \n\nviable competitor or practical alternative to other fuels. In a 2008 research study published in \n\nElsevier, American Consumers were found to prefer the use of petroleum to ethanol, even if \n\nthey have a positive willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid pollution.  \n\n \n\n\u201cResults indicate that overall perceptions of ethanol are positive, but ethanol is not the \n\nglobally-preferred transportation-energy alternative, even among consumers with a positive \n\nWTP\u201d (Petrolia, Bhattacharjee, Hudson, and Herndon, 2008, p. 121). \n\n \n\nAlthough ethanol has historically had a positive image and its production has been \n\nlauded and implicitly supported, its production in the USA has mainly been the result of long \n\nstanding US subsidies and tariffs by the US government. The governmental support has been \n\nso strong that the USA has recently been an exporter of ethanol to Brazil, the world\u2019s second \n\nlargest exporter of ethanol and the USA\u2019s main competitor. New global implications on the \n\nfuture of ethanol arose as the 45-cent per barrel tax credit and 54-cent tariff on ethanol \n\n\n\n 15 \n\nimports was lifted in December of 2011 (Parker, 2011). This tariff was imposed as a \n\nprotection for American farmers that naturally highlighted the competitive relationship that \n\nthe USA and Brazil had in respect to ethanol. This tariff combined with other tax incentives \n\ngave the US ethanol industry preferential treatment (Zheng, Vedenov, and Wetzstein, 2007). \n\nSubsidies are generally used to protect and incentivize fledgling industries and the production \n\nof ethanol in the US reached export levels, showing that it no longer needed the government \n\nintervention that it had historically received.  \n\nSecond-generation ethanol has been under development in recent years. This biofuel \n\nmade from non-edible materials has promised to alleviate some of the food vs. fuel \n\ncontroversy that surrounds first-generation ethanol. Although the promise of ethanol made \n\nfrom inedible raw materials has been very appealing, the materialization of commercial \n\ncellulosic ethanol plants has been slower than anticipated (Danko, 2013). The breakdown of \n\nthe inedible materials requires unique processes and enzymes. The first wave of cellulosic \n\nethanol plants have moved from development to commercialization and are projected to reach \n\nfull capacity in the next few years (Guzman, 2012). A recent Reuters article explained what \n\nhas been some of the hold up, \u201cThe second-generation method recovers sugars bound up \n\ninside the tough cellulosic plant matter. However the cost and instability of the process have \n\nso far prevented it from moving beyond the laboratory\u201d (Gomes, 2013). As the industry is so \n\nnew, many are adopting a wait and see approach to whether it will be viable in the long term \n\n(Lynn, 2013). \n\n2.3 The Future of Biofuels  \n\nThe future of the development of ethanol is not completely certain. The US\u2019 ethanol \n\nhas been for the most part corn based but switch grass as a second-generation ethanol has \n\nbeen considered as a more efficient and practical alternative (Pimentel and Patzek, 2005). \n\nThis would alleviate certain concerns about the elevated prices of food in using corn for \n\nethanol. It is not completely certain how the lifts on the subsidies and incentives will effect \n\nthe development and research on the production of ethanol in the USA and whether it will \n\ndeter advancements on efficiency of ethanol production.  President Barack Obama has been a \n\nbig supporter of green energy and historically supported cellulosic ethanol (Barack Obama\u2019s \n\nCampaign Promises, 2008). However the discovery of new oil deposits in the USA may slow \n\ndown his urgency in the development of biofuels (Klare, 2012). The Renewable Fuels \n\nStandard is a source of hope for second-generation ethanol. Modified in 2009 to include \n\n\n\n 16 \n\nincreasing levels of cellulosic ethanol in US gas blends, \u201cUnder the federal Renewable Fuel \n\nStandard, gasoline and diesel producers are required to blend 36 billion gallons of biofuel a \n\nyear into their products by 2022, including 16 billion gallons of cellulosic fuel\u201d (Herndon, \n\n2012). These increasing percentages and quantities give cellulosic ethanol producers a \n\nsafeguard when investing and building their businesses. \n\nUp until late 2012 the higher demand for sugar and oil in Brazil has slowed ethanol \n\nproduction (Bullion, 2012).  Despite this apparent slowing down for ethanol, some \n\nresearchers believe that there will be an uptick in production. According to research published \n\nin the International Sugar Journal in 2012, demand for ethanol should increase in the \n\nupcoming years. \n\n \n\n\u201c\u2026 there are few immediate benefits seen for Brazil's more sustainable cane-based ethanol \n\nindustry from the expiry of a historic import tariff, mainly due to tight supplies and high \n\ndomestic demand for both motor fuel and sugar. However, by 2016, Brazil expects this \n\nsituation to improve significantly, based on sectoral expansion through the opening of new \n\nmills, and environmental legislation in California which will favour cane-based ethanol over \n\ndomestic maize-based suppliers. The US is also seeing fresh trade challenges to its booming \n\nethanol sector, both from the European Union, which has seen the development of its infant \n\nindustry stymied by increasingly competitive US imports subsidized by a blending incentive, \n\nand China, which has launched an ongoing anti-dumping investigation into soaring US \n\nexports of ethanol-derived distillers dried grains used for as animal feed in that territory\u201d \n\n(Bullion, 2012 p.79). \n\n \n\nWith a predicted increase in demand for ethanol coming from Brazil, the USA, China, and \n\nEurope, this may be an excellent time to consolidate expertise between the USA and Brazil \n\nand to work towards making ethanol, primarily second-generation ethanol, a world traded \n\ncommodity and a more widely used fuel resource. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.epa.gov/otaq/renewablefuels/rfs2-4standards.pdf\nhttp://www.epa.gov/otaq/renewablefuels/rfs2-4standards.pdf\n\n\n 17 \n\n3 Research Question and Hypothesis \n\nThis thesis will analyze how the USA and Brazil can reach a better win-win situation in \n\nthe development of ethanol. The research will present the historically competitive relationship \n\nthat the USA and Brazil have had with ethanol and also how it has impacted the development \n\nof ethanol as a commodity. The research will also analyze the current atmosphere for \n\npotential partnership taking new legislation, economics, and other research into account. The \n\nhypothesis of this research is that only a firm cooperation between Brazil and the US will \n\nprovide the means of turning ethanol into a world-traded commodity. This cooperation \n\nshould/could involve multiple levels, including but not limited to technical, economic, and \n\npolitical. The way that this partnership can flourish will be under the co-opetition model, \n\nwhere both parties engage in a cooperative competition. Basic models of co-opetition have \n\nbeen described using game theory and this model often works with companies that are in the \n\nsame market. For example, both companies invest in research and development that will \n\nbetter their product or make their production more efficient but at the same time compete for \n\nthe market share that has been increased because of this innovation. The idea is that by \n\ncooperation the market will expand, or the size of the pie will expand. The competition aspect \n\ncomes from who gets a bigger slice of the pie. The benefit of cooperating is that the size of \n\nthe overall market increases and therefore each company increases its earnings overall, yet the \n\ntwo entities still compete openly in the market. Co-opetition also occurs between companies \n\nin the same industry that are looking to lower costs. Cost lowering is done by partnership, \n\nwhile still remaining competitors (Brandenburger and Nalebuff, 1996). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 18 \n\n4 Literature Review \n\n4.1 US-Brazil Relations \n\nWith the rise of Brazil as one of the emerging powers to watch over the next century, \n\nmuch has been written and speculated over the state of and future of US-Brazil relations.  \n\nWith Brazil\u2019s rise and the US declining from its hegemonic position and facing a multi-polar \n\nglobal power distribution, the two countries are looking at an unprecedented shift in power \n\ndynamics. Although some would assess the relationship to be positive and growing, others \n\nwould say that there are hurdles of understanding and prioritization in US-Brazil Relations \n\nand little real overlapping areas of strategic interest. Some of the major issues within the \n\nrelationship are Trade, Global Energy and the Environment, China, and the Middle East. \n\nThere are many different views on how these issues impact relations between these countries.  \n\nAccording to Matias Spektor, professor at FGV in Rio, the foundation for positive US-\n\nBrazil relations is an acknowledgment that they are both important to each other\u2019s future in \n\nthat a prosperous Brazil is a good thing to the USA and that having a friend in Washington is \n\nbeneficial to Brazil.  \n\n \n\n\u201cBrazil and the United States need each other to cope with the daunting problems that require very deep cooperation \n\nin the twenty-first century: climate change, trade, financial stability, food security. These are all big issues where you \n\ncannot reach a deal without having the United States and Brazil at the table\u201d (Spektor, 2011). \n\n \n\nWhenever Rousseff and Obama meet, the importance of one nation to the other needs to be \n\nexplicitly stated between the two presidents.  The two countries need to build a narrative that \n\nincludes the fact that in 21\nst\n century Brazil is a rising power and has more influence \n\ninternationally.  The meetings between the first African American President in the USA and \n\nthe first female president in Brazil are symbolically powerful as it ties two of the most racially \n\nand ethnically diverse nations in the world (Spektor, 2011).  \n\nAccording to a 2011 report issued by the Stratfor Analysis, US-Brazil relations face \n\nobstacles because there are little overlapping strategic interests between the two and they are \n\nopposed on transient and existential issues. According to this report, the relations between US \n\nand Brazil have been a lot of talk and no action, highlighting the Obama visit to Brazil in \n\n2011 (Barriers to U.S.-Brazilian Cooperation, 2011). This report downplayed the importance \n\nof the dialogue of the presidential meetings as simply lip service while Spektor claims that it \n\n\n\n 19 \n\nis the most important outcome of these meetings.  An article published by The Economist \n\nIntelligence Unit shortly after Obama\u2019s trip to Brazil stated that other more important global \n\nissues such as the crisis in Libya upstaged the trip.  The trip was criticized as a \u201cspring break\u201d \n\nfor the President. Still there was discussion over the promotion of development of renewable \n\nfuels and various forms of exchange, scientific to educational, between the two countries \n\n(Upstaged, 2011). In 2012, Rousseff visited Washington and the major dialogues that were \n\nelevated in 2011 were reviewed, and there seemed to be a reemphasis of the major themes, \n\nwith more emphasis on infrastructure investment and international business issues. A joint \n\nstatement from President Obama and President Rousseff issued from The White House in \n\nApril 2012 stated that \u201cThey welcomed the growth of the U.S.-Brazil trade and investment \n\nrelationship, illustrated by a record $74 billion in two-way trade in 2011\u201d(Joint Statement by \n\nPresident Obama and President Rousseff, 2012). \n\n Although many may have different opinions on the importance of the meeting \n\nbetween the two presidents, it seems that there has been some change in the dialogue between \n\nthe two nations with Obama explicitly highlighting the importance of Brazil to the US in his \n\npointing out that Brazilian US imports support 250,000 jobs back home in the US (Upstaged, \n\n2011) and the open invitation for Brazilians to come to the USA and shop. In March of 2011 \n\nhe stated how the rise of Brazil as the worlds seventh largest economy was remarkable and \n\nthat Brazil was not the country of the future but having its moment now and that the USA \n\nwould be supportive in helping Brazil develop, including becoming its best customer once \n\npre-salt was extracted and available for consumption (On the first day of his visit, Obama \n\nemphasizes US-Brazil trade relations, 2011). Rousseff has a more pragmatic and US-friendly \n\napproach than Lula, who focused more on South-South relations, which has also helped to \n\nimprove relations between the US and Brazil (Pragmatic Diplomacy, 2011). \n\n One of the most important issues is Trade; however most see this issue as not \n\nprogressing rapidly, at least in the near future. Trade is conflicting, both countries want to \n\ncreate more jobs and export more, but both need to agree on loosening barriers, Brazil wants \n\nto export more to the USA but it would need to equally open up barriers, if that is the case \n\nthen the USA would flood the market with very competitive goods (Barriers to U.S.-Brazilian \n\nCooperation, 2011). Brazil has historically been a very closed market and practiced heavy \n\nimport substitution. Spektor also noted the limitation on the discussion about trade, \u201cWe first \n\nneed to get the conversation going again to restore the atmosphere, to establish a personal \n\nrelationship between the two presidents and lay the ground for future progress on trade\u201d \n\n(Spektor, 2011). Although the trade issue is somewhat of a standstill, it may be one of most \n\n\n\n 20 \n\nimportant elements to US-Brazil relations, and one that may affect many other areas of the \n\nrelationship, so while it is important to create the right atmosphere for these talks, it is also \n\nimportant not to table the issue for too long. Trade in energy may be what really prompts both \n\nparties to the table, both with petroleum and ethanol.  \n\n Another issue that has effected US-Brazil relations is the Middle East and how much \n\nBrazil is willing to actively support and align itself with US Foreign Policy. Some believe that \n\nBrazil has for the most part supported the USA in most of its international endeavors and this \n\ncoupled by that fact that Brazil is a stable democracy will further deepen ties between the two \n\nnations (Almeida, 2009). Others see Brazil as historically taking a sort of hands-off approach \n\nto the affairs of the rest of the world and focused more on domestic affairs.  The US will want \n\nBrazil to take a more active role in foreign affairs (Barriers to U.S.-Brazilian Cooperation, \n\n2011). As Brazil becomes more of a global power with greater influence, this pressure will \n\nundoubtedly grow. As Brazil continues to appear more on the global stage, it will \n\nundoubtedly go through a learning process in international affairs, however it need not follow \n\nthe lead of the US exactly, which has a reputation of over involvement in international affairs.  \n\nHowever some of Brazil\u2019s forays into the international arena have been met with \n\nmixed reactions, such as when Brazil\u2019s President Lula\u2019s meeting with Iran\u2019s President \n\nAhmadinejad to negotiate a deal with the west. The two Presidents seemed to be getting rather \n\nfriendly, which was confusing to other western countries and possibly damaging to Brazil\u2019s \n\nglobal ambitions. Rousseff has taken a more pragmatic approach, distancing herself from Iran \n\nand publically voicing her opinions against human right violations (Pragmatic Diplomacy, \n\n2011). \n\n Rousseff was a political prisoner, tortured under the dictatorship, one would expect \n\nthat she would voice her opinions more boldly on threats to human rights abroad. In fact, \n\nRousseff has kept some of the style of her predecessors, demonstrated when she abstained \n\nfrom the United Nations Security Council resolution rid Libya of Col. Muammar el-Quaddafi, \n\nwhich was later criticized by the Unites States Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice. \n\nHuman Rights Watch has also criticized Brazil\u2019s fence sitting position on Syria (Spektor, \n\n2011). However, it may be a false assumption to think of President Rousseff as hypocritical, \n\n\u201c\u2026she is resisting the pull from Paris, London, and Washington to coerce governments that \n\nhave fallen in their disrepute. And she is denouncing the dangers inherent in the rising tide of \n\nhumanitarian interventionism\u201d (Spektor, 2011). Rousseff emphasizes the need for \n\n\u201cresponsibility while protecting\u201d to avoid imperialism while trying to aid other nations. \n\nRousseff may need to be clearer in her practical stance and point of view in the future, to \n\n\n\n 21 \n\navoid the continued impression of Brazil as just idly standing by as international atrocities \n\noccur.  \n\n Energy has been an issue at the forefront of US-Brazil relations and it has been a cause \n\nfor hope as well as conflict. In an article entitled  \u201cEthanol Diplomacy\u201d, written by Wilson \n\nAlmeida from the Catholic University of Brasilia, relations between the US and Brazil were \n\npredicted to strengthen because the US would depend more on Brazil for ethanol. According \n\nto the article, The US\u2019 energy demands will continue to increase while its capacity will \n\ndecrease. Dependence on oil imports represented 35% in 1973, 55% in 2001, and it is \n\nprojected to be 76% in 2020. This growing demand for energy coupled with the diminishing \n\nglobally known energy reserves would make the US more dependent on Brazil in the future as \n\nthe biggest producer of sugar cane based ethanol in the world, a highly more efficient form of \n\nethanol than that of corn (Almeida, 2009).  \n\nHowever, there have been serious drops in ethanol production in Brazil through late \n\n2012 due to the high price of sugar, a globally traded commodity, and what was the \n\nartificially lower price of gasoline. Brazil has actually imported more ethanol from the USA, \n\neven after the tariff lifted in late 2011. Brazil has higher gas mixing requirements than the \n\nUSA for cars and almost all cars sold in Brazil are flex fuel, so it has a relatively high built in \n\ndomestic demand because of this (Cruz, 2011). \n\nThe USA also has an increasing positive future prospective on its oil reserves with its \n\nshale-gas boom.  In December 2011, \u201cThe total value of US oil and gas deals in the quarter \n\nrose by 135% from the same period a year earlier, with 46 deals totaling $48.8 billion\u201d \n\n(Platt, 2011). Obama has stated on various occasions such as his 2008 election campaigns, his \n\n2011 trip to Brazil, and his 2012 acceptance speech for reelection that he is concerned with \n\nthe global dependence on harmful fossil fuels. It is not only an environmental and supply \n\nissue to the US, but also deeply political due to its relations with the Middle East. However in \n\n2012, Obama\u2019s rhetoric seemed to become more inclusive and embracing towards fossils \n\nfuels, while still maintaining his support of green energy.  While Obama reaffirmed the \n\nimportance of Green Energy in a 2012 State of the Union Address, he also celebrated the \n\ngrowth of domestic oil and gas output and promised more offshore drilling (Klare, 2012).  \n\nObama may see ethanol and gas as not being entirely substitutes, but somewhat like \n\ncompliments as they are blended and the more energy resources the better. As this was before \n\nthe elections, Obama may have been trying to appease his Republican counterparts, only time \n\nwill tell whether Obama continues to push policy towards the development of Green Energy.  \n\nAlthough energy reserves are always a concern, it is not clear cut as to how the energy issue \n\n\n\n 22 \n\nwill play out in US-Brazil relations, it is dependent on several factors such as public policy, \n\nproven energy reserves, global political factors (outside the US and Brazil), climate changes, \n\netc. \n\n4.2 The Viability of Ethanol \n\nThere has been much debate over the importance of ethanol as a viable fuel alternative \n\nto petroleum. Some of the main issues are how Ethanol compares to Petroleum in terms of \n\nmileage and price; the latter is a dynamically shifting and dependent on other factors, and \n\nwhether or not world petroleum reserves are depleting. It is clear that ethanol provides a \n\nrelatively small portion of the world\u2019s fuel demands, and during its history ethanol has been \n\nprotected and aided by subsidies and trade tariffs so as to protect it from competitors and \n\nprovide incentives in the industry. But the question remains, is the investment in ethanol a \n\nsmart investment for the future? Some authors such as Sorrell, Spears, Bentley, Brandt, &amp; \n\nMiller argue that we are approaching petroleum\u2019s peak and in order to maintain the world \n\nrunning at its current rate there must be sufficient investment in ethanol at least 20 years \n\nbefore the depletion of petroleum. There are a number of opposing views on the viability of \n\nethanol as a world trade commodity and adequate replacement for petroleum. \n\nThe pros of using ethanol include not emitting the harmful gases that petroleum gives \n\noff, using less of imported petroleum in fuels for small vehicles, and keeping more money in \n\nthe country (USA or Brazil) and out of the hands of what some may deem questionable \n\nregimes. The US has long been concerned about its dependence on foreign oil and the \n\ndevelopment of homegrown substitute is a positive and necessary alternative to some. A few \n\nof the cons include getting fewer miles per the gallon, questionable environmental gains, and \n\npossible damaging effects on the food supply (Weisenfelder, 2012). Ethanol provides fewer \n\nmiles per gallon across the board. Ethanol also takes a good deal of energy to produce and \n\nprovides less energy than petroleum, although sugarcane has been proven to be more efficient \n\nthan corn ethanol (Yuill, 2009). In 2012 the UN called for a suspension to US mandated corn \n\nethanol production due to concerns on world food supply and reports from Cornell \n\nUniversity\u2019s David Pimentel that argued that corn ethanol is a costly and inefficient substitute \n\nto gasoline, containing only 61% of gasoline\u2019s energy and having higher production refining \n\ncosts (Brooks, 2012). It is also unclear as to what are the real environmental gains by using \n\nethanol because there is substantial amount of energy needed to produce ethanol, especially \n\nfor corn ethanol as sugar ethanol uses other parts of the sugarcane for fuel production. Also \n\n\n\n 23 \n\nthere are tailpipe gases in the use of ethanol, they are less damaging overall than petroleum, \n\nbut may not be substantially so (Weisenfelder, 2012). \n\nIt should be addressed that the discourse on ethanol changes significantly when talking \n\nabout corn ethanol and sugar ethanol. The concerns of food shortage issues, fuel efficiency, \n\nand costs of production are more dramatic with corn ethanol than they are with sugar cane. In \n\na 2009 Harvard International Review article David Pimentel, one of the strongest voices \n\nagainst corn ethanol, wrote that the environmental effects of corn ethanol production are \n\ndamaging because of soil erosion, emission of greenhouse gases from nitrogen use, and the \n\nemission of pollutants such as peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and nitrous oxide. He also states \n\nthat the production of corn ethanol has increased the price of several foods that are linked to \n\ncorn production, mainly because corn is a feedstock, which has contributed to global hunger \n\n(Pimentel, 2009). A 2012 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report found that the impact of \n\nfederal ethanol policies, namely the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Renewable Fuel \n\nStandard (RFS) has a negative impact on the US chain restaurant industry, commodity prices, \n\nand the food supply chain (PwC Study: Renewable Fuel Standard Is Estimated to Cost Chain \n\nRestaurants Billions, 2012). There are plenty of critics that say that corn ethanol is wrongfully \n\ndeemed a solution to the long-term energy needs of the USA.  \n\nHowever some project that the global demand of ethanol will rise substantially over \n\nthe next few years, with the USA being the biggest producer of ethanol in the world and with \n\nBrazilian ethanol production vulnerable to global sugar prices, it may not be the wisest idea to \n\npull out of the corn ethanol market. Based on the Global Management Consulting and Market \n\nResearch firm Lucintel, the global demand for ethanol is projected to see double digit growth \n\nthrough 2017, despite the controversies that surround the issue regarding sustainability, \n\nshortages on the food supply, etc. It states that the largest ethanol production comes from \n\nNorth America and Europe had the highest growth rate (Growth Opportunities in the Global \n\nBiodiesel Market 2012\u20132017: Trends, Forecasts, and Market Share Analysis, 2012).  Brazil\u2019s \n\nethanol production has slumped due to high sugar prices that were present up until recently \n\nand the artificially low price of gas. With rising demand of ethanol and the innate volatility in \n\nthe Brazilian ethanol market due to the price taking nature of commodities, it may still be \n\nattractive to stay in the ethanol business despite the criticisms against the industry. The US \n\nmay need to invest more into other raw materials for producing ethanol, such as switch grass. \n\nUsing grass should lessen the arguments on global food supply issues and keep the US \n\ncompetitive in the ethanol global ethanol market. \n\nSugar ethanol seems to get more global support due to its higher fuel efficiencies and \n\n\n\n 24 \n\nless damaging associated impacts.  Sugar ethanol produces 3,370 liters of ethanol per acre \n\nwhile corn produces barely a third of that total, 1,400 liters per acre (Yuill, 2009). Sugar \n\nethanol also uses part of the plant to fuel production of ethanol making it less damaging. \n\nEthanol producers also produce sugar and can easily switch between the two depending on the \n\ndemands for each commodity. Many believe that sugar cane is a viable substitute for \n\npetroleum and will contribute to international development because the industry still has the \n\npotential for growth and more productions will create many more jobs and increase global \n\ntrade (Hira, 2011). According to research published in the International Sugar Journal in \n\n2012, demand for ethanol should increase in the years to come. With a predicted increase in \n\ndemand for ethanol coming from Brazil, the USA, China, and Europe, this may be an \n\nexcellent time to consolidate expertise between the USA and Brazil and make ethanol a world \n\ntraded commodity and a more widely used fuel resource (Bullion, 2012). \n\nWhile sugarcane seems to have certain advantages over corn, ethanol production in \n\nBrazil has still slumped because of the vulnerability of the industry to other factors in global \n\ncommodity demands. When the US corn ethanol subsidy and tariffs lapsed in 2011, Brazil \n\nwas facing a growing domestic demand while productions slumped (U.S. Ethanol Subsidies \n\nEnd as Brazilian Production Shrinks, 2011). This highlights inherent vulnerabilities in the \n\nBrazilian ethanol industry. It is widely accepted that Brazil is home to the most advanced \n\ntechnology in sugarcane ethanol development but due to unforeseeable conditions, Brazilian \n\nethanol production can drop in a way that it can\u2019t meet its own domestic demands.  \n\nThe issue of price comparison depends mostly on the price of petroleum and because \n\nethanol is blended into petroleum the two can be considered compliments as well as \n\nsubstitutes, which complicates the matter. According to a 2012 USA Today article, while E85 \n\n(85% ethanol blend) fuel prices are lower, when adjusting for miles to the gallon they are \n\nsubstantially higher (Woodyard, 2012). The Brazilian market has evolved a bit more with \n\nethanol consumption at a required minimum of 18% of ethanol-gas blends (Biofuels Mandates \n\nAround the World, 2011). Studies have been done that show that Brazilian consumers will \n\nchoose ethanol based on consumer preferences and relative prices (Silva Filho, Pacini, Silva, \n\nLima, and Guasti, 2011). \n\nOne recurring argument for the development of biofuels is the belief that the world \n\nwill max out its petroleum reserves at some time in the not too distant future and in order to \n\nkeep the world running and progressing there needs to be a viable alternative that has been \n\nsufficiently developed by the time this happens. In a study conducted by UK Energy Research \n\nCentre, researchers concluded on a range for the peak of global petroleum production.  \n\n\n\n 25 \n\n\u201cThe timing of the global peak for conventional oil production is relatively insensitive to \n\nassumptions about the size of the global resource. For a wide range of assumptions about the \n\nglobal URR of conventional oil and the shape of the future production cycle, the date of peak \n\nproduction can be estimated to lie between 2009 and 2031. Although this range appears wide \n\nin the light of forecasts of an imminent peak, it may be a relatively narrow window in terms of \n\nthe lead time to develop substitute fuels\u2026Delaying the peak  beyond 2030 requires optimistic \n\nassumptions about the size of the recoverable resource combined with a slow rate of demand \n\ngrowth prior to the peak and/or a relatively steep decline in production following the peak\u201d \n\n(Sorrell, Spears, Bentley, Brandt, &amp; Miller, 2009 p.170). \n\n \n\nAccording to Wilson Almeida, the USA is the highest energy consumer and its production of \n\npetroleum does not come close to meeting its growing energy demands. Energy consumption \n\nwill increase by 50% in the next 25 years, with non- Organisation for Economic Co-operation \n\nand Development (OECD) countries increasing by 19% and developing countries increasing \n\ntheir consumption by 85%. He further states that the world is running out of known oil \n\nreserves and that coupled with secondary factors like the Iranian crisis are causes of the most \n\nrecent oil crisis (Almeida, 2009).  \n\nAlthough this argument of global petroleum reserve depletion is a compelling one, it is \n\nweakened by the reports of a new oil boom in the USA and excitement about pre-salt reserves \n\nof the coast of Brazil. The US has proven reserves, which are oil reserves \u201c\u2026you can take to \n\nthe bank\u201d (DiPeso, 2011, page. 97). The US Energy Information Administration (US EIA) \n\nstated that proven reserves in 2009 were at 20.68 billion barrels. In 2010 the USA consumed \n\nabout 19.2 million barrels of petroleum and crude oil products per day, about 7 billion barrels \n\nfor the year. There are other sources of energy that are classified as technically recoverable \n\nbut because of unknown factors regarding quantity, quality, and the cost of extraction of the \n\nenergy, these may not be viable or cost effective sources of energy for the US. The total \n\namount of energy that is retrievably worthwhile in the USA is unknown, but the fact that it is \n\npotentially a lot intrigues many domestic consumers and producers. The USA may have \n\npotentially a lot of energy, but it is up to policymakers if the US will invest and focus on \n\nbuilding up its domestic oil industry (DiPeso, 2011). \n\nIn late 2012, Exxon announced that US oil boom will continue and that coupled with \n\nhigher fuel efficiency will make North American a net exporter of oil by the middle of the \n\nnext decade (Downing, 2012). Talk that the US will reduce petroleum imports has been \n\npopular among politicians. Even President Barack Obama, who was such an ardent advocate \n\n\n\n 26 \n\nof green energy in the past, has reduced his criticism of fossil fuels, mostly because concerns \n\nover dependency of imports has been reduced. \n\n \n\n\u201cBut today, says the EIA, the outlook is very different. The agency now predicts that total US \n\nliquids production will climb to 12.1 million barrels by 2025\u2014a 38 percent increase over the \n\n2005 projection. If accurate, this increase, combined with an expected slowdown in the \n\ndemand for oil (because of the current sluggish economy and longer-term improvements in \n\nautomobile fuel efficiency), will produce a sharp drop in the amount of oil that will have to be \n\nimported in 2025\u2014from the 2005 estimate of 19 million barrels per day to just 8 million in \n\nthe 2012 projection. If it materializes, this import drop could prove highly beneficial for the \n\nUS economy and foreign policy.\u201d(Klare, 2012) \n\n \n\nAlthough the prospects of less oil imports seem positive, some argue that the fact that the \n\nUSA will still use oil as its main source of energy will keep it vulnerable to and somewhat \n\ndependent on the regions in Africa and the Middle East in the future (Klare, 2009). In a \n\nDecember 2011 article in Global Finance Sandy Wong wrote,  \n\n \n\n\u201cForeign buyers accounted for 76% of the total value of US oil and gas mergers and \n\nacquisitions in the third quarter of this year, with 22 deals valued at $37.3 billion, according \n\nto PwC US. The total value of US oil and gas deals in the quarter rose by 135% from the \n\nsame period a year earlier, with 46 deals totaling $48.8 billion\u201d (Wong, 2011). \n\n \n\nThe positive aspects of increased reserves of easily accessible oil in the USA have been a \n\ncause for optimism about the US\u2019 economic future, and eased up on the urgency for \n\ndeveloping alternate fuels. \n\nPre-salt reserves bring a lot of excitement and expectation to Brazil\u2019s energy industry, \n\nbut the means of extracting these reserves is still a daunting challenge because of capital \n\ninvestment and technological issues.  However, the knowledge that these reserves exist has \n\nattracted domestic and foreign investors (Abrantes and Cohen, 2011). The fact that pre-salt is \n\non the table may halt the need to advance research on ethanol development in Brazil, at least \n\nfor policymakers. The debate on the longevity fossil fuels that are feasibly extractable is a hot \n\none. There are many unknowns such as the prospect of future technology that will make \n\nextraction of energy that is currently difficult to reach more cost effective, the quantity of the \n\nenergy, the quality, etc (DiPeso, 2011). What is a commonly accepted idea is that the world \n\n\n\n 27 \n\nwill at some point in the future, distant or near, run out of petroleum, which will bring \n\ncountless security and economic dangers to many of the world\u2019s most powerful and oil \n\ndependent nations. The prospect of developing renewable energy may fortify nations \n\npolitically; possessing renewable energy that is highly developed can act as leverage in the \n\ninternational political arena. \n\n4.3 Second-Generation Ethanol \n\nSecond-generation is a comparably newer industry that presents an appealing solution \n\nto the dilemma of competing with the worlds food supply, as the raw materials are inedible. \n\nCorn stover and bagasse, which are residues from production of first-generation ethanol, are \n\nused to make second-generation ethanol. In a 2012 study published by BioMed Central, the \n\nresearchers analyzed the cost competitiveness of second-generation ethanol made from \n\nsugarcane bagasse. \n\n \n\n\u201cAmong the viable processes, steam pretreatment followed by enzymatic hydrolysis is \n\none of the most promising approaches for ethanol production from lignocellulose, and this \n\nconfiguration was adopted in the present study for the 2G ethanol production from sugar \n\ncane bagasse and leaves using separate hydrolysis and fermentation. Other techno-economic \n\nstudies on ethanol production based on more or less the same process concept have been \n\nperformed previously for various materials, e.g., switch grass, tall fescue, hardwood, \n\nsoftwood, straw, poplar, salix, corn stover, and sugar cane bagasse\u201d (Macrelli, Morgensen, \n\nand Zacchi, 2012). \n\n \n\nThe study concluded that ethanol made from sugarcane bagasse is competitive with first-\n\ngeneration starch based ethanol in Europe. The study also shows that second-generation \n\nethanol can be made from a wide variety of raw materials and that the process of fermentation \n\ndoes not differ much from one second-generation raw material to another. This is valuable \n\nwhen it comes to applying innovation found in the fermentation process of one country\u2019s \n\npredominant raw material for second-generation ethanol to another\u2019s, sugarcane bagasse to \n\nwood chips or switch grass for example.  \n\n There has been excitement generated over cellulosic ethanol over the last few year, \n\nhowever it is not until recently that second-generation ethanol has moved closer to the \n\ncommercialization stage. In a January 2010 publication, the technology for producing \n\n\n\n 28 \n\ncellulosic ethanol was described as being in its \u201cnascent\u201d phase but was poised to grow with \n\nthe right government policy and financial support (Cellulosic Ethanol - Next Wave Second \n\nGeneration Bioethanol. 2010). Second-generation ethanol can be produced in ethanol plants \n\nthat specialize in first-generation ethanol but as of late 2012 there has been more talk of plants \n\nthat produce second-generation ethanol exclusively that have or will be reaching commercial \n\ncapacity in the next few years. \u201cCellulosic biofuel companies will boost production almost 20-\n\nfold in 2013 as the first high-volume refineries go into operation, signaling a shift from an \n\nexperimental fuel into a commercially viable industry\u201d(Herndon, 2012). GraalBio has \n\ndeclared that it will be open for business by the end of 2013. \n\n \n\n\u201cBrazilian startup GraalBio says that by December of this year it will begin operating South \n\nAmerica's first, and one of the world's only, commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol refineries. \n\nLocated in the town of S\u00e3o Miguel dos -Campos, the $150 million plant is expected to \n\nproduce 82 million liters of biofuel yearly using waste from the miles of sugarcane fields \n\nsurrounding it. That figure is 10 times that of current facilities, which are operating at \n\ndemonstration scale. GraalBio founder Bernardo Gradin says the plant will succeed by \n\nintegrating the processing steps using state-of-the art technologies developed in Italy, \n\nDenmark, and elsewhere. The company is also looking to create a better form of sugarcane \n\nwhich would produce over three times more biomass\u201d(Lynn, 2013). \n\n \n\nThe Brazilian ETH and Danish Inbicon plant is expected to open operations in 2015 (Gomes, \n\n2013).  These two cases also highlight some Brazilian-European partnerships in second-\n\ngeneration ethanol. Brazil, along with the USA will be looking to Novozymes to provide \n\nenzymes that will break down the tough second-generation ethanol raw material. Novozymes \n\nhas announced that it will be looking to establish enzyme production facilities in Brazil \n\n(Novozymes to supply first advanced biofuels factory in Brazil, 2012). Which will no doubt \n\nstrengthen the connections between Brazil and Europe in second-generation ethanol \n\ndevelopment.  \n\n The Oregon based ZeaChem announced in 2013 that it is currently operational and \n\nramping up to capacity. ZeaChem is among the first operational cellulosic biorefineries in the \n\nworld and its opening is good news to many as the plant\u2019s expected capacity will help the US \n\nreach its cellulosic fuel production goals in the future.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 29 \n\n\u201cZeaChem says it makes ethanol from wood from a fast-growing hybrid poplar variety farmed \n\nnearby as well as locally sourced agricultural residues. The demonstration plant has an \n\nannual production capacity of 250,000 gallons\u2026. Under the Energy Independence and \n\nSecurity Act of 2007, the U.S. was supposed to produce 500 million gallons of cellulosic \n\nethanol in 2012, but all that arrived was a mere 20,000-gallon dribble early last year\u201d \n\n(Danko, 2013). \n\n \n\nWhile there is a lot of excitement over cellulosic ethanol many are adopting the wait and see \n\napproach for cellulosic ethanol plants such as GraalBio and ZeaChem, as second-generation \n\ndoes not have the history that first-generation ethanol has. (Lynn, 2013) \n\n Many are very optimistic about cellulosic ethanol and believe that the industry is on its \n\nway to being cost competitive with first-generation ethanol. According to an industry survey \n\ndone by research company Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), cellulosic ethanol \n\nshould be cost competitive with corn ethanol by 2016. Costs in the industry have greatly \n\nreduced owing to the sharp drop in the cost of enzymes that break down the complex sugars \n\nfound in the inedible raw material, however capital expenditures will need to be reduced in \n\norder for the industry to match the costs of producing corn ethanol. \n\n \n\n\u201cThe survey collected data and predictions on the production costs of 11 leading players in \n\nthe cellulosic ethanol industry. All use a technique, commonly called enzymatic hydrolysis, to \n\nbreak down and convert the complex sugars in non-food crop matter, and a fermentation \n\nstage to turn the results into ethanol. The results showed that in 2012, the cost of cellulosic \n\nethanol production was $0.94 per litre, around 40% higher than the $0.67 per litre cost of \n\nproducing ethanol from corn, which dominates the US biofuel market and is competitive with \n\nUS gasoline. By 2016, respondents thought the price of cellulosic ethanol would match that of \n\ncorn-based ethanol\u201d(Cellulosic Ethanol heads for Cost-Competitiveness by 2016, 2013).     \n\n \n\nThe article emphasizes the need to focus on capital costs over the next few years and \n\nhighlights the growth of cellulosic ethanol in Brazil. Although 5 out of the 10 of the semi-\n\ncommercial plants in the world that have either been announced, commissioned, or due online \n\nshortly are located in the USA, Brazil is gaining momentum in the area, with two plants \n\nhaving been announced so far. As with first-generation ethanol Brazil and the USA seem to \n\nbe the forerunners in cellulosic ethanol development. (Cellulosic Ethanol heads for Cost-\n\nCompetitiveness by 2016, 2013). \n\nhttp://www.epa.gov/otaq/fuels/rfsdata/2012emts.htm\n\n\n 30 \n\n Indeed the US has a good deal of incentive to invest in cellulosic ethanol given the \n\nincrease in cellulosic ethanol fuel amounts in gasoline due to the Renewable Fuel Standard \n\nand Obama\u2019s new initiatives in Green Energy. The Renewable Fuel Standard was set in 2007 \n\nby the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with increasing targets each year of \n\ncellulosic ethanol in gasoline. The EPA may lower the targets based on industry output, \n\nhowever if output is sufficient then blending targets remain (Herndon, 2012). This policy \n\ngives the industry a secure foreseeable demand. Also, Obama has spoken often and \n\npassionately since his reelection about Green Energy. Obama has spoken to congress about \n\ncommitting two billion dollars over the next ten years to the Energy Security Trust (EST). In \n\nsummary, Obama\u2019s plan is to use royalties from the oil and gas industry to fund green energy \n\nand eventually wean the US of oil. Some have criticized this plan as promoting fossil fuels. \n\nObama\u2019s has pointed to electric cars as a good alternative to petroleum fueled cars (Adams, \n\n2013). Electric cars, while not emitting carbon emissions directly, if the power source is \n\ntraced back, you will find the electricity is generated by gas and coal fired stations (Rowley, \n\n2011). While pushing for electric cars, it may be wise to look into green energy sources that \n\nwould generate the electricity for these cars. Ethanol, namely second-generation ethanol could \n\nprovide this source of green energy that powers the stations, which generate electricity for \n\nthese cars that Obama has in mind.  \n\n The US and Brazil seem to have a good deal at stake in the development of cellulosic \n\nethanol and the cellulosic ethanol market. As this is the case, joint investment in R&amp;D and \n\ninnovation towards lowering capital costs and improving the technology involved in the \n\nbreakdown of the complex sugars and the fermentation of cellulosic ethanol would be greatly \n\nbeneficial to companies in the USA and Brazil. Both countries would benefit from a model \n\nthat allowed the technology transfer while enabling them to stay competitive.  \n\n4.4 Co-opetition \n\nA relatively new approach to viewing inter-firm interactions combines elements of \n\ncooperation and competition, the amalgam is co-opetition. This theory is a more complex \n\nmulti-dimensional view of business. It goes beyond the business as war mentality and adds a \n\nlevel of cooperation or peace to how competitors are traditionally viewed. Competitors can \n\nbring more resources to the table, in the form of innovation or R&amp;D for example, and increase \n\nthe market for a good or service, so they cooperate upstream, then compete to divide up the \n\npie and downstream (Brandenburger &amp; Nalebuff, 1996). \n\n\n\n 31 \n\n                      \n\nFigure 1 - Co-opetition Model (Brandenburger and Nalebuff, 1996) \n\n \n\nCo-opetitive strategies are applied to all players within the Value Net of a Company. \n\nCustomers, suppliers, competitors, and complementors make up the Value Net. A \n\ncomplementor is a company that provides goods that complement the good your company \n\nproduces. For example, auto companies and insurance companies are complementors. All \n\nthese roles are interdependent, and one company may be your competitor in one instance, then \n\nyour supplier or complementor in another instance. The trick is being able to shift paradigms. \n\nPetroleum may be viewed as a competitor to ethanol in one instance, then a complementor in \n\nthe next.  The Value Net is depicted on a vertical and horizontal axis.   \n\n \n\n\u201cAlong the vertical dimensions of the Value Net are the company\u2019s customers and \n\nsuppliers. Resources such as raw materials and labor flow from the company to its customers. \n\nMoney flows in the reverse direction, from customers to the company and from the company \n\nto suppliers. Along the horizontal dimensions are the company\u2019s competitors and \n\ncomplementor\u201d(Brandenburger &amp; Nalebuff, 1996, page 18). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - The Value Net (Brandenburger and Nalebuff, 1996) \n\n\n\n 32 \n\nEach line in the Value Net represents a relationship that is important to the company, and this \n\nis where game theory is applied. (Brandenburger &amp; Nalebuff, 1996) \n\nCo-opetition uses game theory to combine aspects of cooperation and partnership in \n\neach business relationship. The idea is that business is not all win-lose but that in certain cases \n\nit can be win-win. A game is described as having PARTS (Players, Added Values, Rules, \n\nTactics, and Scope). Players make up the Value Net. Each player has Added Value, which is \n\ndefined as the size of the pie when you are in the game minus the size of the pie when you are \n\nout of the game. Added Value is Player\u2019s power in the game. Rules are structure and \n\nregulations that govern a game. Rules can allow you to negotiate in transactions or not, to \n\nshare certain types of information or not, etc. Rules however are not always fixed; they can be \n\nchanged to create better wins. Tactics are actions that are related to managing and shaping the \n\nperceptions of your competitors. Scope is related to the size of the game. In reality everything \n\nis interrelated so it is all one big game, however it is too hard to comprehend and analyze a \n\ngame of this size, so boundaries are created to better map out and play smaller games \n\n(Brandenburger &amp; Nalebuff, 1996). \n\nGame theory is applied to all the relationships within the Value net. Game theory \n\ninvolves analysis of perceptions, namely that of your competitors, which requires one to put \n\nyourself squarely in someone else\u2019s shoes. This process is called Allocentricism, and involves \n\ntrying to make decisions based on your competitor\u2019s perception of the game, as well as your \n\ncompetitor\u2019s perception of your perceptions and so on and so on. Perceptions are crucial to \n\nGame Theory as it will shape the actions of all those involved (Brandenburger &amp; Nalebuff, \n\n1996). An example that Brandenburger and Nalebuff use to describe the benefit of analyzing \n\nthe other player\u2019s perceptions is the division of a pie. Intuitively one may think that cutting a \n\npie down the middle and then letting the other player choose which half he/she wants is the \n\nmost fair way to divide the pie, but actually perceiving the pie from the other player\u2019s point of \n\nview may allow you to arrive at a better win-win scenario. For example if you know that the \n\nother player prefers crust and that you prefer filling, you would split the pie in a way that \n\nwould be better for both parties.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 33 \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - Perception\u2019s role in Co-opetition (Brandenburger and Nalebuff, 1996) \n\n \n\nUnderstanding the other\u2019s perception of the game allows you to come better prepared to the \n\nbargaining table. In late 2012, Brazilian based Copersucar bought a majority stake in the US \n\nbased Eco-Energy making it the largest ethanol company in the world. Negotiations are over \n\nand the deal has been closed, however it is a good case to apply allocentricism. Eco-Energy \n\nmay have put itself in the shoes of Copersucar to analyze the benefit of having a policy like \n\nthe Renewable Fuel Standard which will guarantee demand for years to come for Copersucar \n\n(Nielsen &amp; Kassai, 2012). Brazilians in the ethanol market complain that Brazil does not have \n\nsimilar policies to safeguard their investments. After the purchase Luis Roberto Pogetti, \n\nCopersucar\u2019s Chairman, stated in a conference call, \u201cThe U.S. mandate is here to stay. Eco-\n\nEnergy can offer oil companies the complete package and Copersucar is the provider of \n\nsugar-cane ethanol in this package\u201d (Nielsen &amp; Kassai, 2012). Likewise Copersucar may \n\nhave put itself in Eco-Energy\u2019s shoes to analyze the value of having access to sugar-cane \n\nethanol that will meet the growing ethanol blending requirements in the USA. These are two \n\ncompanies from different continents, which most likely have different perceptions. Being able \n\ntake on the other\u2019s worldview is invaluable for negotiations.  \n\nYou can apply game theory in business when analyzing relationships with suppliers \n\nand competitors for win-win situations. In some cases, competitors can be a real blessing. One \n\nexample is the case of commercial airplanes manufacturers and commercial airlines. If you \n\nare a commercial airline, the existence of a competitor to buy a portion of the planes made by \n\nyour supplier will help to reduce the cost of these planes overall.  Your supplier should have a \n\ngood amount of customers; otherwise it might not make sense for your supplier to be in the \n\nplane manufacturing business since it is costly and capital intensive. The game here is to \n\nencourage a healthy number of competitors. The presence of competitors brings added value \n\nand makes the pie bigger by reducing costs. You also want your competitor airlines to have a \n\ngood customer base so that they do not feel tempted to engage in price wars and consequently \n\nmake the pie smaller for all. Going after your competitor\u2019s loyal customers may not be the \n\nbest win-win as this will further tempt your competitor into a price war. In this case the better \n\n\n\n 34 \n\nstrategy would be to reward your own loyal customers, as airlines have done with frequent \n\nflyer programs, so that they use your services more (Brandenburger and Nalebuff,  1996). \n\n Some have criticized the idea of co-opetition and dismissed it as just being a form of \n\ncollusion. They emphasize the corporation portion of co-opetition as being a threat to a free \n\nmoving competitive environment. However, co-opetition offers something that collusion does \n\nnot, benefits to the consumer by way of better products and services (Brandenburger &amp; \n\nNalebuff, 1996). Competitors collaborate to expand the pie, by contributing to R&amp;D for \n\nexample, once the pie is bigger, all compete to divide it up. There is still all the natural market \n\nforces of supply and demand that drive natural pricing downstream, it is just the portion that \n\nexpands the pie that is cooperative. Competitors are interested because if they have the same \n\npercentage or even a bit smaller percentage of the total of a bigger market than they are \n\nmaking more profits (Walley, 2007). Since co-opetition is a highly dynamic relationship, it is \n\nimportant to keep tabs on the effects it is having for all those involved. Is it still bringing \n\nincreased benefit for the co-opetitors and customers? \n\n  Co-opetition is a complex theory that involves many players that are constantly \n\nengaged in a dynamic shifting of roles, certain facets of an industry and the nature of the \n\nrelationships of the competitors are more conducive to the rise of co-opetition. Members of \n\nthe value net are constantly shifting roles. A value net is a relational view of one company to \n\nthe other groups that it interacts with, it is made up of customers, suppliers, competitors, and \n\ncomplementors.  One company within your value net can play several roles are once or at \n\ndifferent times. Complements are linked to each other\u2019s demand in that having one product \n\nincreases the utility of having the other and vice versa. For example, peanut butter and jelly \n\nare complements.  Your competitor may one day be your complementor and then your \n\nsupplier (Brandenburger &amp; Nalebuff, 1996). \n\n Certain conditions are more conducive to co-opetition than others and the co-opetitive \n\nrelationships within the value net are fragile and run the risk of going sour. For instance, co-\n\nopetitive relationships happen more frequently in global industries. The more unstable the \n\nindustry, the more distance in technological know how, the more distance between \n\norganizational systems, and the more difference in cultures between companies, the better the \n\nconditions for co-opetition (Padula and Dagnino, 2007). The presence of all or some of these \n\nthings conditions cause companies to seek more complex relationships with their competitors \n\nfor the mutual benefit of all parties.  \n\n Some believe that with the complex shifts involved in co-opetition there is a risk of \n\ndisrupting the strategies that make a company successful. In tightly knit systems there may be \n\n\n\n 35 \n\nmore of a risk of unraveled systems within the company and that co-opetition may act as a \n\nwrench in the system. Since positive complementors may have negative effects, it is \n\nimportant to make sure that co-opetition has strong centralized directions (Bonel &amp; Rocco, \n\n2007). As co-opetitive strategies involve many moving parts, it is important to train managers \n\non when to employ co-opetitive strategies, how to make the transition to a co-opetitive \n\nstrategy, and how to successfully manage a co-opetitive strategy once it is in place.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 36 \n\n5 Methodology \n\n5.1 Action Research \n\n The methodology applied in this work will be Action Research. This is a type of \n\nresearch where the researcher is an active participant in the process. Action and research are \n\ninterwoven so the two are simultaneously being done at all times. It is not the case that action \n\nis taken as a means to learn or research is done as a means to act, Action Research combines \n\nresearching and acting in a dual process. Action research is applied for the betterment of \n\ncommunities in the study of worthwhile topics that will improve humanity (Reason &amp; \n\nBradbury, 2001). The process can characterized as constant process of observation, reflection, \n\nand improvement for all those involved. The researcher therefore is a facilitator and key to \n\nprocess of change, not just a passive observer.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - Action Research Model (Adapted from Obrien, 1998) \n\n \n\nAction Research was chosen as a methodology in order to best facilitate constructive \n\ndiscussion and as a means of possibly questioning misconceptions and drawing attention to \n\nopposing perceptions on US Relations or the ethanol Industry. In this way the dialogue for \n\npartnership can find possibly new solutions or strategies. The role of facilitator here is to build \n\n1. Diagnosing: \nDefining a problem \n\n2. Action Planning: \nConsider  alternative \n\n(better) courses of \naction  \n\n3. Taking Action: \nSelecting a course of \n\naction \n\n4. Evaluation: Analyze \nand evaluate the \n\neffects of the plan of \naction \n\n5. Draw Conclusions: \nSolidify findings of the \n\naction  \n\n\n\n 37 \n\nbridges. \n\n5.2 Research Process \n\n The way Action Research will be applied in this thesis is through the interviewing of \n\nstakeholders in the months leading up to the Congress. In this forum various questions will be \n\nposed that will deal with the future of ethanol and more specifically, how the USA and Brazil \n\ncan form and alliance that will create stronger positioning for ethanol as a main go-to fuel \n\nalternative in the future. The Forum will have 30 participants, 15 from the USA and 15 from \n\nBrazil. The goal is to balance the participants between academia, government, and business. \n\nAcademics will come from FGV, Columbia University, Stanford, UC Berkeley, among \n\nothers. The government representatives will come from the Ministry of Agriculture of Brazil, \n\nthe Vice President of Brazil Michel Temer, Florida Government, among others.

When speaking on the subject, most stakeholders \n\nwere in favor of creating some sort of partnership; however the dynamics of this partnership \n\nand what would be ultimately gained from it varied depending on each individual\u2019s \n\nperspective. Throughout the interview process, many discussed the viability of ethanol, the \n\npossibility of technology transfers, hedging climactic risks, second-generation ethanol, \n\nexpanding markets and creating volume, and creating a state of co-opetion to strengthen the \n\nmarket. Some of the opinions were conflicting while other seemed to support one another. By \n\ncompiling these opinions one can examine how perceptions on the same topic can differ or \n\noverlap and how we can harness these perceptions towards more productive collaboration. \n\n6.1 State of Ethanol \n\nMost that were interviewed distinguish between ethanol made from corn or sugar and \n\nsecond-generation ethanol made from biomass. The latter is being developed now and still \n\nrequires further research and development, as the energy is harder to extract. While first-\n\ngeneration ethanol is made from sugars and vegetable oils, raw materials for ethanol that can \n\nalso be used directly to feed human populations or as a feedstock to animals, second-\n\ngeneration ethanol is made from agricultural residues or waste, or woody chips, which makes \n\nthe fuel harder to extract (Biofuel Technologies, 2011). The former is the more traditional \n\nfirst-generation ethanol which, in the form of corn from the USA and sugar from Brazil, has \n\nbeen the bulk of world\u2019s supply, as the USA and Brazil have been the Number 1 and 2 \n\nproducers of ethanol for quite some time.  \n\nHowever, many stakeholders voiced their concerns over corn ethanol. As Chris \n\nSomerville notes, corn has reached its limit in development. Echoing some of the known \n\nliterature on corn ethanol, Tadeu Andrade highlighted that corn competed more directly with \n\nthe world\u2019s food supply. Many critics of the American corn ethanol industry and its historic \n\nprotection through tariffs and subsidies have also cited the danger that this domestic industry \n\nposes to the world\u2019s food supply and consequently global food prices (Brooks, 2012). \n\nAlbert Fishlow also touched on the shortcomings of corn as an expensive fuel \n\n\n\n 40 \n\nalternative that threatens to raise the price of food globally by being an incidental product of \n\nmeat and poultry, however he also stated the sugar ethanol is not the most efficient alternative \n\nsource, although it is certainly a better one than corn. Ethanol producers in Brazil respond to \n\nglobal prices and will switch to sugar if the global demand, or in turn the pricing, is more \n\nattractive. Since it currently is not a heavily subsidized industry, it does not compete with the \n\nglobal supply of food in the way the corn ethanol industry did, especially when it was heavily \n\nsubsidized.  Albert Fishlow mentioned that alternative sources of renewable energy in forms \n\nsuch as grass and tree limbs were being researched right now and may present better \n\nalternative fuel solutions. Albert Fishlow credits the size of the Brazilian Sugar ethanol \n\nindustry more to the fact that is started early, in the 1970s, however he does not see the \n\nlongevity of the sugarcane ethanol industry as the Brazilian and American governments were \n\nmore focused on extracting the newly discovered sources of petroleum that have been \n\ndiscovered in recent years in both countries in the form of shale oil and pre-salt. Albert \n\nFishlow sees a more productive partnership between the USA and Brazil in finding ways to \n\nincrease the world\u2019s food supply through technology transfer. Thomas Trebat also noted that \n\npre-salt has \u201ctotally dominated government thinking\u201d, to the detriment of ethanol. Although \n\nhe is somewhat more optimistic about the future of ethanol, he does point out that the industry \n\nwill need large-scale innovation for it to make sense. \n\nAlbert Fishlow certainly sees that focus on petroleum reserves as a threat to the \n\nethanol industry. He noted that since the 1970s there have been articles published saying that \n\nat some point the world\u2019s petroleum supply will run out. As he recalls, these articles always \n\nhighlight that the world is approaching its end in fossil fuels and ignite fear that is supposed to \n\nmotivate further development of ethanol, however he concludes, \u201c\u2026everybody\u2019s been saying \n\nthat for many years, the difficulty in part is that they are constantly finding new reserves.\u201d  \n\nMr. Fishlow points out that you can go back to the 1970s and find instances where one was \n\ngoing to hit the peak in terms of oil that was available and suddenly we find new reserves. Mr. \n\nFishlow also points out, aside from the new oil sources that have been found of the coast of \n\nBrazil and places such as Alaska, that the coast of Africa is also being explored, as one would \n\nexpect that since Brazil and Africa were at one point one land mass, there would likely be oil \n\nreserves of its coast as well.  So in a sense, Albert Fishlow discredits the reports that we are \n\napproaching the apex of our oil supply, therefore weakening the argument for ethanol.  \n\nSimilarly Luis Roberto Pogetti affirms that the threat of using up our petroleum \n\nreserves is not likely to happen, as was once believed. As he puts it,  \n\n \n\n\n\n 41 \n\n\u201cThe evaluation of the availability of ethanol is totally different from what it was ten \n\nyears ago. Ten years ago I heard a lot that day that petroleum energy would be used up, \n\nbecause it is a finite reserve that is constantly being consumed. Presently, the view of the \n\nworld is that there is a lot of petroleum available in the world\u2026.the argument that petroleum \n\nwill someday end is not really a factor anymore in discussing the variables involved in \n\nethanol development. So renewable energy won\u2019t exist because petroleum is going to run out, \n\nbecause it won\u2019t run out. Now the issue that exists today regarding petroleum is not whether \n\nit\u2019s going to run out or not but rather the cost of extraction, and the environmental cost of \n\nextraction.\u201d \n\n \n\nLuis Roberto Pogetti continued to name examples of costly incidents involving the \n\nextraction of petroleum. Including the potentially high cost of the extraction of pre-salt \n\npetroleum off the coast of Brazil and the environmentally costly incident of the BP oil spill of \n\nthe coast of the US. As Luis Roberto Pogetti stated, \n\n \n\n\u201cYou have pre-salt that has an elevated cost of extraction. You also have the risk of what \n\nhappened off the coast of United States with British Petroleum. So after that the cost of \n\nextraction looked like it is pretty high. There are issues surrounding extraction of oil from \n\nsand, sand oil, principally in Canada. And there's also the shale oil in the US which right now \n\nis becoming a fever, very popular. It uses a process that's called cracking, which is like \n\nbreaking the rocks for the gas to be extracted. There are environmental issues that are \n\nbrought up which involve cleaning the water that they use to extract the gas, that contaminate \n\nthese waters.\u201d \n\n \n\nThe new oil deposits found in the USA have been met with great excitement but some of have \n\nhighlighted the potentially high extraction costs and the uncertainty about the nature of the \n\nreserves. This goes back to a recurring argument that while the US may have found new \n\nsources of petroleum derived energy, it is next to impossible to accurately ascertain the exact \n\namount of the energy and the quality, furthermore the cost of extraction, which are linked to \n\nthe quality of the energy reserves, can make it so it is not worthwhile to recover the petroleum \n\nenergy (DiPeso, 2011). However these doubts do not seem to deter the excitement over these \n\nnewly found energy sources, as Albert Fishlow confirms, as long as there is pre-salt and other \n\npetroleum based energy deposits in the USA, that\u2019s where the focus will be.  \n\nChris Somerville discussed how the US is becoming a net exporter of petroleum, a \n\n\n\n 42 \n\nsurprising turn of events due to the recently found fuel sources, and the US will rely on these \n\nnew found petroleum sources for domestic consumption and international trade. Ethanol is \n\nalso less calorically powerful than petroleum, as Mr. Rezende Barbosa points out, the price of \n\nethanol can only be up to 70% of petroleum in Brazil for it to be worthwhile to consumers. He \n\nbelieves that there needs to be further development of motors that can use ethanol more \n\nefficiently, otherwise this will be the \u201cknife\u201d that threatens ethanol.  \n\nMost ethanol stakeholders will admit that the chances of ethanol completely \n\nsubstituting petroleum derivatives are slim; however Ethanol\u2019s prospects shift if you start to \n\nview it more as a compliment to petroleum than a straight substitute. Luis Roberto Pogetti \n\npoints out that if we set our sights on replacing 15% of the world\u2019s petroleum usage with \n\ngasoline than it will be a big step for ethanol. He also affirms that this mix of gasoline and \n\nethanol is the best mix for cars. Ethanol provides less mileage but more power to smaller \n\nvehicles, which is why the mix is ideal.  As Mr. Pogetti stated, \n\n \n\n\u201cI do not see ethanol as a direct competitor to fossil fuels. It should meet another demand, the \n\ndemand for the environment\u2026. So along this line, a project for shale gas, sand oil, pre-salt, \n\netc. Should not interfere with projects to develop ethanol. Why? Because these fuels have \n\ntheir role and ethanol serves its own purpose, which is complementary. It's a renewable \n\nenergy that is able to mitigate some of the effects that it has on the environment.\u201d \n\n \n\nAs Mr. Pogetti continued to explain his point of view, straight petroleum usage is best suited \n\nto large scale industry and the blend of ethanol and gasoline is best suited for small vehicles \n\nbecause ethanol helps to oxygenate the fuel, mitigating some impacts on the environment, and \n\nis the best combination for small vehicles in terms of potency, or speed and power, and \n\nmileage.  \n\nIn the USA, 95% of the US gasoline contains ethanol in a low-key blend, mostly E10 \n\nwhich is a mixture of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline. The low level blend of ethanol is used \n\nto oxygenate the fuel and reduce emissions of harmful air pollutants. The environmental \n\nprotection agency (EPA) has approved the use of up to 15% ethanol blends, or E15, in model \n\ncars from 2001 and newer. The US renewable fuels standard requires fuel in the US to contain \n\na minimum volume of renewable fuels and requires renewable fuels to be blended in \n\nincreasing amounts each year. There are also higher levels of ethanol blends in the USA, up to \n\nE85, for flex fuel cars; however these fuels are harder to find at gas stations, primarily \n\nconcentrated in the Midwestern region of the United States (Ethanol Fuel Basics, 2012). In \n\n\n\n 43 \n\nBrazil, the mandatory ethanol level was dropped from 25% to 18% in 2011 (Loveday, 2011). \n\nHowever Brazil has a larger flex fuel market than the USA, where ethanol is a large part of \n\nBrazil\u2019s clean energy, second only to hydroelectric power. Almost all of Brazil\u2019s vehicles are \n\nflex fuel and cars have the option of running on 100% ethanol (Mclvor, 2010). So clearly both \n\ncountries have a culture of blending, Mr. Pogetti seeks to promote the blending of ethanol into \n\npetroleum to expand the global ethanol market.  \n\nChris Somerville affirms that the demand for ethanol is there and sites large capital \n\ninvestment into his research organization as proof of the interest, the key may lie in \n\ndiversifying the product. If there wasn\u2019t a drought in the USA in 2012 there would be no way \n\nfor the USA to use all of its ethanol, however as ethanol is volatile due to climactic variables, \n\nthe supply in any one region is not entirely predictable. Looking at different regions with \n\nvarying raw materials and different producers, as well different fuel blends, such as using \n\nsugar to make other types of fuels, would diversify the product.  \n\nAs Chris Somerville affirms, 10% of all fuels could come from Brazil; however it \n\nneeds large scale investment to develop these sources of energy. Chris Somerville adds that \n\nhis organization in the USA has a great deal of respect for Brazil and what is has done for the \n\nrenewable fuels industry but notes that it would benefit from American technology. Brazil \n\nmay have the raw materials but needs research and development as well as the capital to \n\ndevelop these sources. \n\nAnother aspect of ethanol, namely Brazilian ethanol, which has been highlighted \n\nthroughout several interviews, is the enormous potential for sugarcane ethanol to create jobs, \n\nespecially in Brazil. Tadeu Andrade explained how Brazil has barely scratched the surface in \n\nterms of using the land that is capable of producing sugarcane in Brazil, in comparison to \n\nother crops that Brazil produces; sugarcane has a small percentage of the total agricultural \n\nmix in Brazil. Sugarcane has the potential to be developed in regions of Brazil that have \n\nhigher unemployment rates, bringing jobs to these regions, which will stimulate the local \n\neconomies and provide tax dollars to the government. As Mr. Andrade stated, \n\n \n\n \u201cThe development of ethanol in Brazil is at the frontier of such areas as Goias, Maranh\u00e3o, \n\nTokanchi, Matto Grosso, etc. So these are areas of very little job opportunities. One person \n\ntakes care of thousands of inhabitants. If these areas were occupied by sugarcane, it would \n\ngenerate thousands of jobs. This would generate jobs in rural and urban areas\u2026\u201d \n\n \n\nRoberto de Rezende Barbosa also highlights the enormous capacity for sugarcane production \n\n\n\n 44 \n\nthat still lies within Brazil. He added that productivity in the lands that are currently being \n\nused could also improve, however this is a longer process that involves research and \n\ndevelopment and trials over a period of time. He admits that increasing the quantity of land \n\nused to grow ethanol will provide a quicker increase to the supply of ethanol that Brazil \n\nproduces. When speaking of corn in the USA, Tadeu Andrade explains that the market is \n\nmuch closer to capacity than in Brazil and suggests a commitment by the USA to develop \n\nBrazilian ethanol, namely exploring second-generation ethanol. He explained that the \n\nincentive for the USA to develop Brazilian ethanol would be to have a source or renewable \n\nenergy that doesn\u2019t compete directly with feed stocks as corn does, which would keep food \n\nprices in check. By developing Brazilian ethanol, the USA would also help develop a supply \n\nof ethanol for itself and the world, making a larger supply would make ethanol more \n\naffordable.  \n\n6.2 Technology Transfer \n\nThroughout all the interviews, a common theme was hopefulness about the beneficial role \n\nof technology in a USA-Brazil partnership. While there were positive attitudes towards the \n\ntransformative qualities of technology, there were differing opinions on what it could do and \n\nhow it could be used. Also, some had doubts about the capacity to share intellectual property, \n\nwhile others saw it as a naturally occurring process that would happen sooner or later. Some \n\nsaw it as a unifying force between the United States and Brazil, while others viewed \n\ntechnology as more specific to each country and not transferable. It is worthwhile to access \n\nthe different perceptions of technology to understand whether and how this tool, which seems \n\nto be seen as such a powerful force across the board, can be used for mutual gain between the \n\nUSA and Brazil.  \n\nMany, such as Roberto de Rezende Barbosa, pointed out how far the industry has come in \n\nthe last 30 years in developing better techniques for agriculture; according to him productivity \n\nhas pretty much doubled in the last 30 years. While in the 1970s Brazilians looked to the USA \n\nto lead the way, now Brazil is looked at as a reference for ethanol produced in a tropical \n\nclimate. He admits that the US has a much more advanced culture in research and \n\ndevelopment, with many different research institutions and universities.  Brazil\u2019s culture is \n\nnewer and much more concentrated to a few institutions such as CTC and Unicamp.  \n\nMost seem to agree that the US may have something to offer Brazil in way of \n\ntechnological advancement for the development of ethanol. The US is known for its \n\n\n\n 45 \n\ninnovative society in many areas.  Many see the advantage for Brazil if the US were to focus \n\non developing new ways to improve the sugar ethanol industry or if it could concentrate on \n\ndeveloping the process of distilling and fermenting for both first and second-generation \n\nethanol.  \n\nChris Somerville pointed out some of the ways in which he feels American technology \n\ncould impact the Brazilian ethanol industry. He gave some examples of a possible technology \n\ntransfer for crop modeling to predict the crop and logistical software used to access the \n\nimpacts of climactic variation, which according to him are very underdeveloped in Brazil. He \n\nbelieves that a technology transfer would help Brazilian cellulosic fuels become more \n\nproductive, produced from the inedible parts of plants, wood, or grasses. \n\nTadeu Andrade sees the benefit of the US providing technology to the Brazilian sugarcane \n\nindustry. He believes that by providing technology to the Brazilian sugarcane industry the US \n\nis able to obtain ethanol that does not directly compete with feedstock, therefore not raising \n\nthe price of food worldwide. By supporting the Brazilian ethanol industry the US is also \n\nhelping to boost the world\u2019s supply of ethanol, therefore keeping prices down. This way the \n\nUS gains through developing sugar ethanol. Mr. Andrade also pointed out the potential for \n\ndevelopment of second-generation ethanol; both the USA and Brazil are working on second-\n\ngeneration ethanol and are leaders in pursuing best ways to harness the energy out of inedible \n\nraw materials. A partnership between the two countries could lead to bigger investments in \n\nR&amp;D and more cross pollination of knowledge, which would boost the industry.  \n\nAlbert Fishlow stated that the US can certainly provide Brazil with advanced technology, \n\nhowever he thought this technology would be best used to find ways of increasing the world\u2019s \n\nfood supply by finding alternative food sources. According to Mr. Fishlow, ethanol is in a \n\nprecarious position due to the focus that the USA and Brazil has on its new oil deposits. As \n\nthe world is currently hungry for commodities right now, with certain commodities being \n\nmore attractive right now, the price of sugar makes it more attractive for sugar to be produced \n\ninstead of ethanol. Mr. Fishlow suggests that Brazil and the USA focus more on finding these \n\nalternative food sources which will have a readily available market and ease some of our \n\nmore pressing global issues. \n\nThomas Trebat also pointed out a different dimension of innovation needed for the \n\nethanol industry, aside from working with the raw materials or biological component.  As he \n\nstates,  \n\n \n\n\u201cI see it more of a technical matter\u2026ethanol is bedeviled by a lot of issues, it\u2019s hard to \n\n\n\n 46 \n\ntransport, it\u2019s hard to store, you can\u2019t build pipelines because it corrodes them, there aren\u2019t \n\ndistribution networks globally, so I would go back to what I sort of said in the answer to the \n\nfirst question. I think there is a tremendous amount of innovation that needs to occur before \n\nthis ethanol industry really starts to make a lot sense, before it really is something that is a \n\nsignificant competitor to fossil fuels, it\u2019s just too expensive right now, and there\u2019s something \n\nto this argument that it contributes to food scarcity.\u201d  \n\n \n\nAccording to Prof. Trebat, right now there does not seem to be the right infrastructure in place \n\nto support a substantially larger ethanol industry. Innovation in way of pipelines and \n\ntransportation methods certainly would be a step in the right direction. Also, creating \n\ndistribution networks and manufacturing more flex fuel cars abroad, not just in Brazil, would \n\nhelp to spread the industry globally. In order to do this, there would need to be a greater \n\nmarket and greater supply, so all these factors are precariously intertwined. \n\n Another difficulty of technology is the attitude of fierce protection of intellectual \n\nproperty, once the technology is developed. As Tadeu Andrade points, this can be a serious \n\npitfall when trying to progress the ethanol industry as a whole. As he states, \u201cOne side always \n\nknows a little bit more that the other side. So intellectual property in general is a halt to \n\npolitical alignment.\u201d Mr. Andrade also pointed out the dangers of a dominating attitude that \n\ncomes with having certain technologies. \u201cYes it\u2019s very tough because whoever has this \n\ntechnology thinks that they are the king of the world, the king of the world can do anything he \n\nwants.\u201d Although a technology transfer seems to be best thing for the industry as a whole, it \n\nis tough to fathom one relinquishing this kind of innovation to a country that has been \n\nhistorically regarded as your competitor in an industry.  \n\n As Luis Roberto Pogetti stated, he believes that it isn\u2019t smart to quibble about the \n\nrights to technology; the important thing is that technology is used to speed up the \n\ndevelopment of ethanol and electric energy. Throughout the interview process it was pointed \n\nout that electric energy and ethanol are not competitors because electric cars need source of \n\nelectricity, which are powered by fuels.  Mr. Pogetti is reflecting the interest of the industry in \n\ngeneral and not the interests of one party. The implication is that improving the industry is \n\ngood for everyone. \n\n While speaking to Tadeu Andrade, he brought up the fact that other regions in the \n\nworld are looking to learn how to produce ethanol. He gave the example of China buying up \n\nlands in Africa and also Chinese companies coming to Brazil to learn how to produce ethanol. \n\nAfrica is the only other region that has an abundance of available lands that have a climate \n\n\n\n 47 \n\nthat is accommodating to sugarcane.  Although as Luis Roberto Pogetti points out, it does not \n\nhave the infrastructure, markets, or stability at the moment to quickly expand the markets. \n\nHowever the Chinese are looking to develop their knowledge of the process based on what \n\nthey know of grain based ethanol and expands to sugarcane. Brazil has been experiencing a \n\nboom of exports to China because of their demand for commodities, so it may make sense \n\nthat Brazil could look to strengthen their economic ties to China in other ways. However the \n\nBrazilian economy also faces the threat of the Chinese manufacturing industry flooding Brazil \n\nwith its products (Brazilian Manufacturing in the Face of Chinese Competition, 2011). \n\n Tadeu Andrade pointed out that while Brazil has been experiencing increased trade \n\nwith China due to their interest in commodities, a partnership with the US in ethanol makes \n\nmore sense because corn and sugar can ethanol are much more similar that sugar and grain \n\nethanol. The US and Brazil, having long been the number one and two producers of ethanol, \n\nhave spent more time researching second-generation ethanol. As the technologies are more \n\nadaptable to the other\u2019s raw material, it makes more sense to engage in technology transfers \n\nwith each other and invest in research and development together.  \n\n Albert Fishlow points out that such bilateral partnerships in technology are hard to \n\ncontain. The way that technology moves today, the minute that you have something that is \n\nsuccessful it will easily spread. However others, such as Luis Roberto Pogetti and Thomas \n\nTrebat, do not seem to see the object of creating technology to limit its use to Brazil and the \n\nUSA. The object of technology is more to expand the ethanol market globally and expand \n\nmarkets and increase supply.  \n\n Others do not see such a similarity between the technologies for corn and sugar \n\nethanol. As Luis Roberto Pogetti puts it, sugarcane is much more complex than its \n\ncompetitors such as corn and beets with seven times the number of chromosomes, making \n\nresearch difficult as isolating variables is a much lengthier process. Sugarcane ethanol \n\nresearch is also much more expensive as well as time consuming. At the same time, as Mr. \n\nPogetti puts it, corn occupies 10 times more area for planting than sugarcane does, so it \n\nattracts more investment in research than sugarcane as it is cheaper and has a wider audience.  \n\nMr. Pogetti states that Brazil had to develop research centers of its own, like CTC, to meet the \n\ngrowing demand for sugarcane ethanol research in Brazil. However international interest was \n\nslim until 2007, when the growth of sugarcane brought renewed interest to developing ethanol \n\nfrom sugarcane and Pogetti notes that Europe, The United States, as well as Brazil are \n\ninvesting in research for second-generation ethanol.  \n\n Roberto de Rezende Barbosa does not see the feasibility on a technology transfer of \n\n\n\n 48 \n\nfirst-generation ethanol, but sees the differences of the two raw materials as a positive force to \n\nthe ethanol industry.  The two raw materials are quite different and are exposed to very \n\ndifferent climactic variables.  They are also genetically quite different so to crudely apply the \n\nsame technological advances to both would not be effective. What both Mr. Rezende Barbosa \n\nand Mr. Luis Roberto Pogetti agree on is that these two major producers can act as a natural \n\nhedge to guarantee a semi-constant supply of ethanol to the world. As the ethanol industry is \n\nmore vulnerable to climactic variables that are unpredictable, as was the case in the recent \n\ndrought affecting the North American corn, having two major producers that are separated by \n\nhemispheres makes the industry more secure, as the climactic variables that influence one \n\ncrop are unlikely to be the exact same variables that influence the other. In this way risk is \n\nmore distributed. As Thomas Trebat points out, it is beneficial to spread this technology to \n\nother areas of the world. This would create more consumers, and as Chris Somerville points \n\nout, make the industry more secure. \n\n6.3 Second-generation Ethanol \n\n Although collaboration on first-generation ethanol seemed to be more polemic, \n\ncollaboration on second-generation ethanol is an area where many believe that the USA and \n\nBrazil can create a more mutually beneficial partnership by jointly investing in research and \n\ndevelopment.  It is the newest frontier of renewable energy and provides a solution to the \n\ndilemma of using raw materials that compete with feedstock for ethanol.  However, as this is \n\na relatively new area, researchers are still trying to discover the best ways to extract the \n\nenergy from these nonfood materials. \n\nUnlike first-generation ethanol, second-generation ethanol is made up of raw materials \n\nthat are typically present when the edible materials are extracted. A lot of the left over parts of \n\nfood materials, such as wheat stock, are being explored as raw materials for fuel, principally \n\nfor small vehicles. These materials are agricultural residues, what may have been considered \n\nto be waste, that have the potential to be used as a renewable energy. This area provides quite \n\na bit of hope for those looking for a renewable energy source that truly would not negatively \n\nimpact the world's food supply and drive up food prices. First-generation biofuels are made \n\nfrom such edible materials as sugar, starch, vegetable oil, animal fat, and corn. The \n\ntechnology to produce first-generation ethanol is already well developed, and many believe \n\nthat the technology is very specific to each raw material and not easily transferred to others \n\n(Biofuel Technologies, 2011). \n\n\n\n 49 \n\n For quite some time first-generation ethanol has been under the microscope for its \n\nimpacts to the global environments and economy. First-generation ethanol has been linked to \n\ncreating competition not only for food and fiber production but for land and water use as well. \n\nWith the possible exception of first-generation ethanol made from sugarcane, first-generation \n\nethanol made from grains, sugar beets, corn, or oil seeds, have been criticized for their limited \n\nability to achieve targets for \"...oil- products substitution, climate change migration, and \n\neconomic growth\"(Sims, Taylor, Saddler, and Mabee, 2008, page 5). \n\n Due to these concerns over the shortcomings of first-generation ethanol many have \n\nlooked for solutions in non-edible raw materials. Second-generation ethanol is made from \n\nligno-cellulosic materials which include cereal straw, forest residues, woodchips, grasses, and \n\nbagasse. Producing ethanol from these materials could potentially eliminate some of the \n\nshortcomings found in traditional ethanol and potentially offer a reduction of costs in the \n\nfuture (Sims, Taylor, Saddler, and Mabee, 2008). \n\nHowever there are still challenges facing the development of second-generation \n\nethanol. For example, Researchers are still finding ways to break down the cellulosic material \n\ninto sugar. As there are still many technical barriers, the industry is not as developed as the \n\nindustry for first-generation ethanol (Biofuel Technologies, 2011). \n\n Albert Fishlow brought up various aspects of first-generation ethanol, particularly \n\ncorn ethanol, which would lead researchers to look for substitutes. He mentioned the research \n\nbeing done on woodchips and vines, alluding to second-generation ethanol research. Although \n\nhe is pretty certain that petroleum reserves will occupy the attention of government, he also \n\nmentioned the search for other renewable energy sources other than first-generation ethanol. \n\n Both the USA and Brazil are interested in producing ethanol from second-generation. \n\nDuring the interview process many expressed a positive attitude or hopefulness about the \n\npotential for the USA in Brazil to combine their technical know-how and develop more \n\nefficient ways to extract the energy from second-generation ethanol materials. As opposed to \n\nthe division on whether technology developed for first-generation ethanol could be \n\nsuccessfully adapted to other raw materials, the technologies for second-generation ethanol is \n\nperceived to be sufficiently similar for partnership and collaboration to make sense. \n\nWhen speaking to Tadeu Andrade, he expressed the need to develop ethanol \n\nproduction from biomass or second-generation ethanol. Although research is underway for \n\nsecond-generation ethanol, he still believes there is further large-scale development needed to \n\nexpand the biomass ethanol industry. As he stated, \u201c\u2026so I think that a good investment is \n\nresearch and development in second-generation ethanol based on sugar and not on corn, so \n\n\n\n 50 \n\nas not to impact the natural movement of and inflate food prices.\u201d Although the US and \n\nBrazil have gotten the ball rolling in second-generation ethanol research it is commonly \n\nacknowledged that second-generation ethanol is still a frontier territory and would greatly \n\nbenefit from investment in the industry and division of how the industry could look in the \n\nfuture. \n\nWhen speaking to Roberto de Rezende Barbosa, he brought up the similarities in the \n\nfermentation process of second-generation ethanol. He spoke of the energy that can be found \n\nin the lining of sugarcane and how it can be turned into vapor energy in much the same way \n\nthat the lining of corn crops can be turned into energy.  Mr. Rezende Barbosa elaborated by \n\ndiscussing how second-generation ethanol is a huge field of study that has a wide range of \n\nresearch, in the United States and various regions of the world. He mentioned that there are \n\nother regions of the world that study second-generation ethanol but the main countries are the \n\nUnited States and Brazil. He believes that the technology will be available in the next 10 \n\nyears because researching is a very lengthy process. As he pointed out the technology can be \n\navailable but the structure to use it also needs to be in place. There have to be means to \n\nsupport the technology for it to be viable. Mr. Rezende Barbosa also spoke of the centers of \n\nresearch excellence that exist in the United States for this purpose. Mr. Rezende Barbosa \n\nbelieves that in the tasks of envisioning structures to support the future the second-generation \n\nethanol market as well as the development of a method for more efficient extraction of \n\nsecond-generation ethanol, the USA and Brazil have a good opportunity for collaboration. \n\n The themes of volume and hedging risk showed up quite frequently throughout the \n\ninterview process. Many brought up the fact that developing multiple and various energy \n\nsources in different regions were away of not putting all your eggs in one energy basket. \n\nHaving alternative fuel producers in different climactic environment was one hedge, and Mr. \n\nPogetti brought up the idea of an energy portfolio for each country. Developing multiple \n\nsources of energy such as fossil fuels and first in second-generation ethanol are away of \n\ndiversifying your portfolio and consequently being more secure in your energy stance. \n\nAccording to Mr. Pogetti, the USA and Brazil should look at their respective energy matrixes \n\nand learn how to administer their energy sources domestically. \n\n6.4 Co-opetition \n\n Aspects of co-opetion showed up throughout the interview process. Most brought up \n\nthe potential for the USA and Brazil to increase and expand the ethanol market. Some more \n\n\n\n 51 \n\ndirectly pointed out that the ethanol market had to be expanded to other nations in order for it \n\nto have more of a viable future.  \n\nCo-opetition incorporates game theory which deals heavily in the perceptions of the \n\nparticipants of the game. Brandenburger and Nalebuff explain this in their 1996 book, \n\n\u201cDifferent people view the world differently. Just as the players added values and the tools \n\nare important elements of the game, so are the players\u2019 perceptions. The way people perceive \n\nthe game influences the moves they make\u201d (Brandenburger and Nalebuff, 1996, page 52). \n\nThey also went on to give an example of the Texas shootout as an important example of how \n\nperception is used to create win-win situations in business. This is when two partners that the \n\nbusiness and specify what they should do if one partner wants to end the relationship. In the \n\nTexas shootout the dissatisfied partner must offer a price. The other partner must either buy \n\nthe dissatisfied partner\u2019s share or sell their share for that price. By incorporating the other\u2019s \n\nperception on what the business is actually worth, a more successful agreement can be \n\nreached. Most win-win situations require an analysis of perceptions, as opposed to win-lose \n\nsituations. A goal of the interview process was also to bring to light perceptions on the same \n\nissues, showing how they overlapped or differed. Clearly there are many aspects of ethanol \n\nand each game participant might have its own perception of each aspect of the game, so the \n\nperceptions may be voluminous and complex, as well as interrelated. As game theory requires \n\none participant to put himself in the other participant\u2019s shoes and incorporate a different \n\nperception, it is useful to have an idea of the other participants lens on looking at the same \n\nissue (Brandenburger and Nalebuff, 1996). \n\n One of the strongest advocates of a co-opetitive strategy was Thomas Trebat. He cited \n\nthe Bush-Lula biofuels agreement as a great step in the right direction, which unfortunately \n\nhad little follow-through. This agreement was meant to advocate further research and \n\ndevelopment in biofuels as well as create third markets in other parts of the world. This was \n\ndone because as President Bush said during a joint press conference following the agreement, \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re dependent on oil from overseas, you have a national security issue\u2026\u201d (Ferrand, \n\n2007). The initiative called for the US to diversify energy sources and reduce domestic \n\nconsumption of gasoline by 20% by 2017, this also made a lot of economic sense at the time \n\ngiven the rising prices of oil due to growing demand in emerging markets such as China and \n\nIndia. The agreement also aimed at bolstering a global market for biofuels, with the objective \n\nof creating structure in the form of rules and regulations. Lula also encouraged the \n\ndevelopment of the biofuels market in countries like Peru, Colombia, Guatemala, and other \n\nnations in the Caribbean in order to create a Persian Gulf equivalent of ethanol in the Western \n\n\n\n 52 \n\nHemisphere (Ferrand, 2007). \n\nThis type of expansion in the global market is part of a co-opetitive strategy. Instead \n\nof looking at bringing in new competitors to the ethanol market, the United States and Brazil \n\nwere looking at the bigger picture of making the pie larger. Making the ethanol market larger \n\ninvolves bringing in new competitors that improve the product, which will in turn bring new \n\nconsumers. By expanding the ethanol market, you are increasing supply worldwide and \n\nexposure to this alternative fuel. After the pie is increased then all the individual countries can \n\ncompete to see who can sell the most, but because there is an increase in consumers \n\neverybody wins. Prof. Trebat cited this agreement as an example of what he envisions for a \n\nsuccessful ethanol market. However he said that he doesn\u2019t know much ever came of that \n\nagreement. He mentioned that students have written papers for him about it and most of them \n\nsay that it was a good idea; however no one seems to give examples of any conclusive results \n\nthat were derived from the agreement. One thing to note about the agreement is that at the \n\ntime oil prices were raising and the USA and Brazil were possibly more concerned with \n\ndeveloping alternative fuel sources, especially with the consumption of emerging markets. \n\nHowever, as has been mentioned previously, many are not as concerned with fuel prices in \n\nthe future due to new reserves of oil being found in the US and Brazil. \n\nProf. Trebat highlighted the importance of bringing the ethanol to third markets. He \n\ngave examples of bringing ethanol to countries like Haiti, Cuba, and the poor countries of the \n\nCaribbean. These are countries that are desperate for job creation and need to diversify their \n\nenergy matrixes. However these third parties lack the technology to make ethanol and \n\nadequate supplies at affordable prices, as well as the adaptive technologies to use ethanol. By \n\nexpanding ethanol to these markets, Brazil and the USA would help create a more thriving \n\nethanol market and also boost the economy of the Western Hemisphere, especially the \n\nsouthern part of the Western sphere. As Prof. Trebat puts it, \n\n \n\n \u201c\u2026 but I think the real challenge for Brazil and the United States for that to be more \n\nthan a somewhat limited commercial relationship between Brazil and the US in regards to \n\nbiofuels, somehow the two have to solve these very thorny problems on how to create biofuels \n\noutside the USA and Brazil. And then I think they can either collaborate or cooperate that \n\npeople gain. Until they can both gain or until there is a substantial market beyond these two \n\nlarge markets, which are the biggest suppliers, the gains from collaboration on ethanol, not \n\nso much biofuels but ethanol, are likely to be fairly marginal.\u201d  \n\n \n\n\n\n 53 \n\nProfessor Trebat later concluded that he almost would rather see the USA and Brazil \n\ncompeting in the ethanol market as this would drive producers to create a better product. He \n\ndid advocate cooperation in the upstream portion of the relationship however, which is a \n\ncharacteristic of co-opetion.  \n\n Aside from bringing ethanol to new markets, others spoke of sharing research and \n\ndevelopment, which would create volume to the market, this expansion of the pie also being \n\npart of the co-opetitive strategy. Prof. Trebat pointed out that Brazil has a culture of study in \n\nagronomy that is more advanced than the US, as well as a more advanced domestic ethanol \n\nindustry than the US. He stated that the US can learn a lot from Brazil in this regards. This \n\nwould essentially expand the ethanol market, especially in the US, then Brazil and the USA, \n\nas well as any other countries that were producing ethanol, could compete for the new \n\nconsumers. Chris Somerville also highlighted how an increase in consumers is security for the \n\nethanol market, and advocated research and development to do so. Others highlighted the fact \n\nthat a cooperation can bring volume to the industry which is an important aspect expanding \n\nthe market. \n\n6.5 The Influence of Policy \n\n Throughout the interview process many interviewees spoke of the importance of \n\npolitics, domestic and international, to the development of ethanol. Some believe that industry \n\nwould be the impetus to create policy that promoted ethanol. Some believe that business and \n\ngovernment need to act simultaneously in order to have successful long-term growth. Some \n\ninterviews showed a desire for one country to learn from the other. All agreed that politics \n\nhad the power to either greatly promotes or severely damage the ethanol industry. \n\n Politics is such a broad topic but when using it to analyze the ethanol industry it is \n\nuseful to separate domestic from international. For instance, developing the ethanol market \n\ncould bring different political gains for the US or Brazil, both in the domestic and \n\ninternational arenas. Also it is important to realize that at times international success is \n\ncontingent upon certain domestic political factors. \n\n One of the important arguments for the US to build up the ethanol industry is to have \n\nleverage against certain major oil producers in the world with which it has historically \n\nconflicts with. As Prof. Trebat explained, most of the US conflicts are related to oil. He \n\nelaborated that our preoccupation with Iraq, Iran, and the Arab Spring are largely linked to \n\nour dependence on oil. Many have pointed to this dependence as a major threat to the USA, \n\n\n\n 54 \n\nand as previously noted, the petroleum reserves in the US haven\u2019t been accurately measured. \n\nLuis Roberto Pogetti also emphasized the importance of being less dependent on Arab \n\ncountries, and developing an ethanol market in the Western Hemisphere. \n\n Another gain for the US in the international arena in the promotion of ethanol would \n\nbe boosting its relations with other Latin American countries. Prof. Trebat stated that by \n\nspreading the ethanol market to other countries in Latin America that face unemployment and \n\nissues of poverty, the US would be strengthening its ties to the Hemisphere and gaining by \n\nboosting the economy of the Hemisphere, principally the southern portion of it. He expressed \n\nhis opinion that the real way to better relations is to help grow the economies and not \n\nnecessarily just having goodwill trips to the nation. \n\n Prof. Thomas Trebat spoke briefly about possible international trade agreements, \n\nemphasizing that the agreement should be more inclusive than exclusive. In line with his \n\nprevious arguments that creating third markets and ethanol was the best way to boost the \n\nindustry, he saw the possibility of creating multilateral trade agreements and not just bilateral \n\nagreements. In this way you can bring more potential producers of the table. \n\n Albert Fishlow predicted that politics would be a wrench for the ethanol industry. \n\nAccording to his argument of focus on petroleum reserves, there would be competitive policy \n\nadvocating petroleum versus policy advocating ethanol and in the end petroleum would win. \n\nHe brought to attention the contradiction of Brazil promoting ethanol while Petrobras is \n\nardently seeking government support for the extraction of pre-salt. Mr. Fishlow also brought \n\nup the case with Chevron in Brazil as an example of stumbling block to partnership.  \n\n Chris Somerville and Thomas Trebat brought up the fact that the USA should be \n\ninterested in partnering with Brazil because it is growing a lot faster in comparison to the \n\nUSA. Chris Somerville pointed out that while Brazil is growing the US is flat or declining, so \n\nit is a good idea to want to tie itself closer to Brazil. This could happen in the form of \n\ntechnical exchange or building a market.  \n\n Tadeu Andrade brought up a very important environmental issue and the support from \n\nimportant environmental groups that the development of the ethanol industry would bring. \n\nMr. Andrade emphasized the political sway that certain environmental groups such as \n\nGreenpeace have in the political arena. By promoting and ethanol industry, governments \n\nwould gain the political supports of such groups that have power in the constructivist sense. \n\n Luis Roberto Pogetti brought up the benefit for Brazil to get more international \n\nexposure by creating bilateral agreements with the USA. He stated that there are few \n\nexamples of successful bilateral agreements with Brazil. It has historically been very closed, \n\n\n\n 55 \n\nboth politically and in business. He also mentioned that Brazil is still new to international \n\npolitics, bringing to attention what he felt were relations with certain countries that may hurt \n\nother more important international relations. He gave the example of Brazil\u2019s relationship \n\nwith Hugo Chavez and how that might be damaging to other international relations. \n\n Tadeu Andrade brought up the prospects of developing the ethanol industry so that it \n\ncould not be as deleterious to the world food supply. As he pointed out, a partnership that \n\nfocused on sugarcane and ethanol from biomass would not be as harmful to the food supply. \n\nThe partnership that created this impact to food prices would be a boost for international \n\nrelations. \n\n Roberto de Rezende Barbosa brought up the fact that Brazil is now the reference for \n\nproducing sugarcane ethanol in a tropical environment and this would be beneficial politically \n\nif the ethanol market spreads globally. According to Mr. Rezende Barbosa, the technology for \n\nproducing sugarcane ethanol in Brazil has dramatically improved in the last 30 years, so much \n\nso that Brazil it is now the vanguard for sugarcane ethanol production. By spreading the \n\nsugarcane ethanol industry to other parts of the world, Brazil would be looked on as a much-\n\nneeded leader in the field. \n\n On the domestic front, the support that the US gives to green issues is in large part \n\ndetermined by which political party is currently in power. As Thomas Trebat noted, ethanol \n\nsupport will depend on whether we have a Democrat in office. As Obama was reelected for a \n\nsecond term, it is more likely that green programs will get more government support than if \n\nwe had a Republican president. However, as previously noted, new oil deposits can excite \n\nboth parties to the point of lowering ethanol as a priority. In fact, as Prof. Trebat pointed out, \n\nthe US has experienced a good deal of lobbying against the ethanol market, less opposition \n\nthan Brazil has. He points out that the US can learn a great deal from Brazil in this industry. \n\n Domestically in the US the corn farmer is supremely politically important. The Iowa \n\ncaucus heavily determines the election of the US president, and because of this fact Iowan \n\nfarmers have a lot of power. As Prof. Trebat points out, the main issue is the farmer. Chris \n\nSomerville discussed how corn farmers fear the low price of ethanol. However, as Prof Trebat \n\nstated, the farmer is not heavily concerned on whether his corn is made into ethanol or sold as \n\nfood, as long as he has a market for what he grows. So for this reason the demand for corn \n\nshould not hurt farmers. And as the tariffs and subsidies were lifted in late 2011, there is less \n\nof a financial burden on the American taxpayer to support the delicate corn ethanol industry. \n\n Long-term security for ethanol producers in the form of domestic Brazilian ethanol \n\npolicy was the theme that came up frequently in the interview process. Luis Roberto Pogetti \n\n\n\n 56 \n\nand Roberto de Rezende Barbosa brought up the fact that ethanol is a capital-intensive \n\nindustry where the assets need to be depreciated on a long-term basis. Because of this high \n\ncost of entry there needs to be domestic policy that removes some of the risk of getting into \n\nthe industry.  Luis Roberto Pogetti brought up the fact that the US has more long-term policy \n\non ethanol blending than Brazil does, because of this producers have no security. Producers \n\ndo not know what will be the percentage of ethanol that is required to be blended into \n\ngasoline in the medium term to distant future. For this reason he believes that ethanol needs to \n\nbe more clearly defined in its role in Brazil\u2019s energy matrix. He believes that businesses and \n\ngovernment need to work together in order to build the industry. \n\n Although he is not a big advocate of subsidies, Mr. Pogetti did point out that ethanol is \n\nnot paid for the positive externalities that it brings to society. These benefits come to society \n\nin the form of public health and a cleaner environment. In order for ethanol to have a \n\ncompetitive advantage it must be paid back for these. By avoiding the use of ethanol, \n\nconsumers will have to pay for better public health and a cleaner environment in the form of \n\ntax dollars. Mr. Pogetti suggests a more preventative measure by paying ethanol producers \n\ninstead, either by the government or the individual. This is not a subsidy, this is paying for \n\npublic benefit. Mr. Pogetti points out that programs are ethanol need government support until \n\nthey gain scale. He stated that Brazil won\u2019t be able to engage in successful bilateral relations \n\nwith the US until they fix these domestic issues. \n\n Roberto de Rezende Barbosa emphasized that politics can either be a blessing for the \n\nethanol industry or mortally damaging. He cites the main issue is harmful interference of \n\ngovernments with the free market movements in commodities. He gave the example of how \n\nthe lowering of gas prices in Brazil has been severely damaging to ethanol. He explained that \n\nethanol producers are prepared to compete with the fluctuations in the price of gasoline and \n\nhave become accustomed to climactic changes that are an unpredictable factor in the \n\nproduction of ethanol. However ethanol producers cannot compete with government policy \n\nthat deals a blow to its industry, such as making the price of gas artificially low.  Mr. Rezende \n\nBarbosa is not an advocate of subsidies in general in Brazil, as opposed to the US where there \n\nis more agility in reacting to political and economic pressures, things in Brazil move a bit \n\nslower in government.  \n\n Tadeu Andrade and Mr. Rezende Barbosa agree that the ethanol provides a great deal \n\nof jobs for Brazilians. By expanding the industry Brazil would create many more jobs at \n\nhome. The expansion of jobs and consequently the boost to the economies of more \n\nimpoverished areas as a result would be a great gain. With this expansion of the ethanol \n\n\n\n 57 \n\nindustry, there should be policy that specifies quality and standards of ethanol. \n\n7 Applying Co-opetition to Second-Generation Ethanol \n\nUpon applying the Action Research Methodology to this research, the issue of where to \n\nfocus Research &amp; Development and Innovation for the best mutual win for Brazil and the US \n\narose. Research and Development is a key part of creating mutual wins in co-opetition. The \n\npower of technology and the hope that all stakeholders expressed in its ability to improve the \n\nethanol and energy markets was very strong. Through using Action Research, different \n\nsolutions were considered.  \n\n \n\n1. Diagnosing: Defining a problem \n\nHow to focus the power of innovation to improve the global ethanol market? \n\n \n\n2. Action Planning: Consider alternative (better) courses of action  \n\nPlan A) The US and Brazil jointly investment in R&amp;D for corn and sugarcane ethanol to \n\nexpand the first-generation ethanol market. \n\nPlan B) The US and Brazil jointly invest in sugarcane ethanol since it has a greater \n\nenergy output. \n\nPlan C) The US and Brazil jointly invest in cellulosic ethanol to help create and expand \n\nmarkets for second-generation ethanol.  \n\n \n\n3. Taking Action: Selecting a course of action \n\nPlan C is the best decision because the breakdown processes as well as the fermentation \n\nand distillation processes of second-generation ethanol are similar enough to apply \n\ntechnology transfer. It is more difficult to jointly invest in first generation ethanol because \n\ncorn and sugarcane are too genetically different to apply the same innovations to either raw \n\nmaterial. Although certain American companies may invest in developing sugarcane ethanol, \n\nit may be more likely that American companies will be willing to invest in developing \n\nsecond-generation ethanol as there is an abundance of raw materials found in the US in the \n\nform of wood, grasses, etc.  \n\n \n\n4. Evaluation: Analyze and evaluate the effects of the plan of action \n\nIn this research, this course of action was evaluated by discussing it with the different \n\n\n\n 58 \n\nstakeholders interviewed. The plan received a positive response. All stakeholders were \n\noptimistic about second-generation ethanol. Stakeholders who discussed successful joint \n\ninvestment in technology for ethanol produced in both Brazil and the United States said that \n\nsecond-generation ethanol would present the better option as the fermentation and distillation \n\nprocesses were similar and second-generation ethanol did not compete with the world\u2019s food \n\nsupply.  \n\n \n\n5. Draw Conclusions: Solidify findings of the action  \n\nThe best means of growing the pie for second-generation ethanol is to produce it more \n\nefficiently, make it cost competitive with other biofuels in as little time as possible, and being \n\nable to deliver when demand increases, especially the secure demand that is present in the \n\nUSA due to policy. The way that companies can do this in the USA and Brazil is jointly \n\ninvesting in innovations in efficiency in technology. The only way that the cellulosic fuels \n\nwon\u2019t be consumed in the USA is if there isn\u2019t supply. It is up to producers to meet the future \n\nstandards that haven\u2019t been met historically. (Danko, 2013) \n\nDuring the research, it became apparent that the co-opetion model could be best applied \n\nto the development of the worldwide second-generation ethanol market. In this case you could \n\nthink of American companies and Brazilian companies working together in a game with the \n\nplayers in their Value Nets. The model applies to the second-generation ethanol because it is \n\nan industry that has a come a good way developing technology to break down the inedible \n\nraw materials of cellulosic ethanol, yet will greatly improve with development in this area as \n\nwell as the fermentation and distillation processes. Although other regions of the world have \n\nshown interest in cellulosic ethanol development, it is the US and Brazil that have the most \n\nplants as of now, and are the current world leaders in ethanol. To better illustrate the co-\n\nopetition strategies between the US and Brazil, it is useful to draw the Value Net for either a \n\nBrazilian or American ethanol company. For this exercise, a hypothetical American cellulosic \n\nethanol company is used to demonstrate co-opetitive relationships, but the inverse could \n\neasily be done with and Brazilian cellulosic ethanol plant.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 59 \n\n \n\nFigure 5 - Example of the Value Net (Brandenburger and Nalebuff, 1996) \n\n \n\nThe figure above shows some of the players in the Value Net for a typical American \n\ncellulosic ethanol company. However as Brandenburger and Nalebuff indicate, the more \n\ncomplete the Value Net the more useful the exercise will be. So to expand on the figure \n\nabove, here are some additional players.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6 - The Expanded Value Net (Brandenburger and Nalebuff, 1996) \n\n \n\nNow that an extended Value Net has been drawn up, we can analyze how to play a better \n\ngame by using the different Elements of PARTS. Brandenburger and Nalebuff devised a \n\nseries of questions that companies can ask themselves in relation to the different components \n\nof the game in order to have better wins. Below are answers to these questions based on the \n\n\n\n 60 \n\nValue Net of our hypothetical American cellulosic ethanol plant. These answers are a \n\nspringboard to apply co-opetition in the international cellulosic ethanol market.  \n\n \n\n1. Player Questions: \n\nWhat are the opportunities for cooperation and competition in your relationship with \n\ncustomers and suppliers, competitors, and complementors? \n\nA) With competitors, both Brazilian and American, an American cellulosic ethanol \n\ncompany can partner up to jointly invest into research institutions and Universities \n\nthat can provide innovation that will more rapidly make cellulosic ethanol production \n\nmore cost competitive with first-generation biofuels. The handful of cellulosic fuel \n\nplants in the USA and Brazil can partner up to bring innovation to and kick-start the \n\nmarket. Although this may attract new entrants, the existing cellulosic ethanol plants \n\nwill have a chance to create loyalty, agreements, and relationships with their \n\ncustomers. \n\nB) As gas companies also want to meet cellulosic ethanol blending requirements in the \n\nfuture given the US policies in place, certain gas companies may have vested interest \n\nin investing in cellulosic ethanol research with cellulosic ethanol producers. As an \n\nincentive, the gas companies that invest may be given a right to purchase a certain \n\nquantity of the cellulosic fuel produced at a discount, to give them an edge over their \n\ncompetition for blended gasoline. \n\nC) Enzymes used in second-generation ethanol production have been one of the most \n\ncostly elements for the industry. Producing enzymes in larger quantities for more \n\nplayers in specific orders can possibly reduce the price of enzymes. \n\nD) Although cars powered by electric energy may be considered competitive to cars \n\npowered by renewable energy, the push by Obama to get the USA off oil and using \n\nmore electric cars may be an excellent opportunity for the cellulosic ethanol industry \n\nas well, both Brazilian and American. In this case, cellulosic ethanol companies in the \n\nUSA should support these green initiatives by Obama but also promote policy that ties \n\nrenewable fuel to electric energy. Electricity needs to be generated by plants that have \n\nbeen, in many cases, powered by fossil fuels. In order to create a more sustainable \n\nindustry, electricity for electric cars should ultimately be powered by cellulosic \n\nethanol. One caveat is that cellulosic ethanol companies should be careful to still \n\nmaintain the support of cars solely powered by second-generation ethanol in the \n\n\n\n 61 \n\nfuture.  \n\nE) Another important building block for the second-generation ethanol market will be \n\npublic awareness. The energy consuming public, especially small vehicle operators, \n\nshould know the environmental benefits of second-generation ethanol as a means of \n\npromoting the market. This awareness can be achieved by launching international \n\nmarketing campaigns.  \n\nWould you like to change the cast of players? In particular, what new players would you \n\nlike to bring into the game? \n\nA) The American and Brazilian Governments in particular could be introduced as \n\ncustomers. The production of second-generation ethanol, in comparison to fossil fuels \n\nprovides positive externalities to the environment and American and Brazilian people \n\nin particular. One way of helping the industry become more competitive would be to \n\npay for these positive externalities directly to the cellulosic ethanol companies. If \n\ncellulosic ethanol is not developed than tax payers will have to pay for the damages to \n\nthe environment and higher food prices down the road, and repairing damages can be \n\nmore costly than avoiding them. \n\nB) Universities, especially in the US, should offer more training to students in agronomy \n\nand other areas that would supply cellulosic ethanol plants with the right employees \n\nor research centers with the right trained staff to more efficiently develop cellulosic \n\nethanol. As Thomas Trebat pointed out, Brazil has more of a culture of university \n\nstudy in these areas and can teach the US to develop this field in universities.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. Added Value Questions: \n\nWhat is your added value? \n\nIn a game this large it may be difficult to precisely access any one company\u2019s added \n\nvalue to the whole pie, however it is easier to quantify added value in smaller subsets \n\nof the game. For instance, if a Brazilian cellulosic company strikes a deal with an \n\nAmerican gas company to provide a certain level of cellulosic ethanol to meet their \n\nblended gas target outputs, the added value really is the value of the entire blended \n\ngas, not just the value of the ethanol to make the blended gas. The definition of added \n\nvalue is the size of pie when you are a player minus the size of the pie when you are \n\nout. Without the cellulosic ethanol there is no blended gas. \n\n\n\n 62 \n\nHow can you increase your added value? \n\nThe added value of cellulosic ethanol really comes from its ability to meet government \n\nmandates of cellulosic ethanol blends in gas. In order to increase added value, it is \n\nimportant to support these mandates in the USA and lobby for secure long term \n\nblending requirements in Brazil. \n\nWhat are the added values of the other players in the game? Is it in your interest to limit \n\ntheir added values? \n\nSince the second-generation ethanol industry is relatively new and a market of \n\nconsumers still needs to be established and target industry outputs have not been met \n\nhistorically, it may be too early to start limiting added value. In being overly \n\ncompetitive any one cellulosic ethanol plant may shoot itself in the foot. Also supplier \n\nprices may shoot up. \n\n \n\n3. Rules Questions \n\nWhich rules are helping you which rules are hurting you? \n\nA) Blending requirements, both in the US and Brazil, for cellulosic ethanol in gasoline \n\nare helping. Long-term requirements are better than requirements that are subject to \n\nchange at any time, like the requirements in Brazil.  \n\nB) Any policy that favors fossil fuels and lowers their prices artificially can be very \n\ndamaging to the ethanol industry. \n\nWhat new rules would you like to have? In particular, what contracts would you like to \n\nhave with your customers and suppliers? \n\nA) Long-term cellulosic blending policies in Brazil would benefit both the American and \n\nBrazilian cellulosic industries as there would be a higher guaranteed global demand. \n\nB) Gas companies also have a vested interest in production of sufficient cellulosic ethanol \n\nto meet blending requirement in the USA. As is the case, striking R&amp;D contracts with \n\ncustomers may be an option. For the gas companies that invest, there should be special \n\nincentives, like discounts on the cellulosic ethanol outputs.  \n\nC) As enzymes are a high variable cost, it may be a good idea to lower costs all around \n\nfor the industry by placing larger orders with competitors. Certain long-term contracts \n\nwould benefit the industry. \n\nDo you have the power to make these rules? Does someone else have the power to overturn \n\nthem? \n\n\n\n 63 \n\nCellulosic ethanol plants, especially those in United States, do no have power to create   \n\npolicy in Brazil. However it would be in their interest if this policy were present and \n\nthe Brazilians private sector has more ability to influence their policy makers. \n\n \n\n4. Tactics Questions \n\nHow do other players perceive the game? How do these perceptions affect the play of the \n\ngame? \n\nOther players perceive the second-generation ethanol industry as one that is positively \n\nviewed by the general public but has been slow to deliver, mainly because of the \n\ncomplicated procedures involved in breaking down the tough inedible raw materials. \n\nPolicy makers perceive the industry as one of over promising and under delivering as \n\nmany targets for cellulosic ethanol that were set late last decade were not remotely met \n\n(Danko, 2013). \n\nWhich perceptions would you like to preserve? Which perceptions would you like to \n\nchange? \n\nPerceptions that the industry is unreliable are hurtful to expansion of cellulosic \n\nethanol. The industry needs to come closer to meeting the targets it sets to create \n\ncredibility and reliance. So ethanol companies in the US need to apply better methods \n\nof forecasting supply. If the forecasts are to be sufficiently accurate, then all cellulosic \n\nethanol plants need to collaborate. The perception of high technical and capital \n\ninvestment may be worthwhile to maintain in order to inhibit ill-equipped new \n\nentrants. \n\nDo you want the game to be transparent or opaque? \n\nMost of the game should be transparent. Due to under delivering in the past, the \n\nindustry already has some hurdles to overcome. The industry should be clear on how \n\nmuch of the Renewable Fuel Standard for cellulosic ethanol that it is prepared to meet. \n\nThis way gas companies may be more willing to sign long-term supply contracts. \n\n \n\n5. Scope Questions \n\nWhat is the current scope of the game? Do you want to change it? \n\nThe game encompasses gas companies, first and second-generation ethanol plants, \n\nautomobile producers, research institutions, fossil fuel companies, and enzyme \n\nproducers, mostly in the USA and Brazil, but also with new investors and suppliers \n\n\n\n 64 \n\nfrom Europe. The game could be improved if new players were brought in from other \n\nWestern Hemisphere countries. This way demand would increase, competition will \n\nincrease, and the product will be improved.  \n\nDo you want to link the current game to other games? \n\nIn the future it may be worthwhile to link the cellulosic ethanol game to the auto \n\ninsurance game. (Brandenburger and Nalebuff, 1996) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 65 \n\n8 Conclusion \n\nThere are many factors that must be considered in order to create a successful strategy \n\nfor expanding the ethanol market through a partnership between the USA and Brazil. Most \n\nstakeholders believe that with the right conditions in place a successful partnership between \n\nthe USA and Brazil in ethanol is possible. The hope lies more in sugarcane ethanol. Some \n\nexpressed doubts on first-generation ethanol entirely, mostly in reference to corn ethanol, but \n\nsaw more promise in second-generation ethanol. Some of the critical success factors included \n\ndeveloping technology for second-generation ethanol, support from the research community, \n\nsupported government policy, bringing ethanol to third parties, demonstrating the benefit to \n\nstakeholders from each country, and developing partnerships between the USA and Brazil in \n\nthe manufacturing sector. Some of the main hurdles include government policies that go \n\nagainst the interests of ethanol producers, concerns over sharing intellectual property, and \n\nbeing distracted by the possibility of new petroleum reserves. It is important for both \n\nAmerican and Brazilian stakeholders to try and understand each other\u2019s perceptions of the \n\nsame industry in order to make their viewpoint of ethanol more flexible as it is an incredibly \n\ndynamic industry, where one sees a problem another sees a solution. By analyzing the \n\nviewpoints of different stakeholders there is more of a chance of reaching a more productive \n\ncollaboration. \n\nThe research showed that while first-generation ethanol is a much more mature and \n\ndeveloped market, it does not provide as many obvious opportunities for collaboration \n\nbetween corn ethanol and sugar ethanol as second-generation ethanol does. Stakeholders \n\ninterviewed spoke about the research being done to make renewable energy from inedible raw \n\nmaterials as being what was on the cutting edge of ethanol development. It sparks optimism \n\nacross the board because of the fact that second-generation ethanol does not threaten the \n\nworld\u2019s food supply or drive up the prices of food. First-generation ethanol uses corn in the \n\nUS, which is widely criticized for its inefficiencies in energy input for production and output \n\nin its use. The qualitative research also showed that not all stakeholders believed that \n\ntechnology transfer in first-generation ethanol would be applicable between countries. These \n\nconditions make for daunting obstacles inherent in a possible partnership in first-generation \n\nethanol. The second-generation market still requires a lot more research and development, it \n\nis a source of hope and renewed excitement in biofuels, however it does not have the years \n\nand structures in place that first-generation ethanol has. The research showed that \n\nstakeholders believed that there would be a significant return on technology advancement for \n\n\n\n 66 \n\nsecond-generation ethanol and that the USA and Brazil have more opportunities for \n\ntechnology transfer in this area as the processing of these raw materials have much more in \n\ncommon than first-generation ethanol raw materials. By analyzing these interviews, it is \n\nevident that there is an opportunity for collaboration but not necessarily a plan of action or \n\nstrategy for this opportunity. \n\nThe research showed that co-opetition model could be applied to developing a more \n\nproductive partnership between the USA and Brazil. While historically ethanol has been \n\nlooked at as a competitive industry between the USA and Brazil, as key stakeholders pointed \n\nout, the ethanol market is in need of expansion and innovation for it to be a viable industry. \n\nBecause of the unique qualities of the market and the potential for its development through \n\nresearch and development, especially in second-generation ethanol, the models of co-opetition \n\ncan be applied to a joint expansion of the second-generation ethanol market. Here the strategy \n\nof jointly investing in Research and Development to \u201cexpand the pie\u201d, then competing to \n\ndivide it up would be more effective. By joint research and development of this market and \n\npromoting interest in second-generation ethanol, possibly by marketing it as a more \n\nsustainable fuel, the industry has the possibility to become much more successful. This \n\nresearch showed that stakeholders in ethanol believed that growing the ethanol market outside \n\nthe US and Brazil would attract more consumers, so there does not need to be any kind of \n\nparanoia between leakage in the technology transfer between the US and Brazil. It is \n\nimportant to note that secure long-term government policy on ethanol-gas mixing should be in \n\nplace to guarantee that there is adequate investment in Research and Development in second-\n\ngeneration ethanol. As many stakeholders pointed out, the industry already has enough \n\nuncertainties and harmful government policy would be detrimental. Policy that secures the \n\nneed for ethanol in gasoline blends would provide the right incentive to invest in research for \n\nthe betterment of this renewable energy. \n\nOne more notable observation from this research is some stakeholders had the \n\ndifferent perspectives on the same issue and sharing differing perspectives can serve to \n\nprovide solutions where some may see obstacles. Not every stakeholder believed in the \n\npossibility of technology transfer for first-generation ethanol, which highlighted that there \n\nwas no polemics about technology transfer for second-generation ethanol. Also, perspectives \n\ndiffered on ethanol\u2019s relationship to petroleum. While some saw a competitive relationship \n\nothers brought up a complimentary relationship. Instead of aiming to displace petroleum, \n\nethanol\u2019s role should be different; by blending into gasoline it makes it less pollutant and \n\nprovides an ideal fuel for small-sized vehicles with a good combination of mileage and \n\n\n\n 67 \n\npower. \n\nThe research showed that a co-opetitive relationship between the US and Brazil is \n\nmade more possible by the state of current relations between the US and Brazil. Recent \n\nmeeting between US and Brazilian world leaders indicate that relations are good and leaders \n\nare looking for opportunities for mutual wins. Although the US would especially like to boost \n\nits domestic economy, increased trade relations may mean unwanted competition in the \n\nBrazilian domestic market. While trade seems to be at a standstill, meeting between Rousseff \n\nand Obama have showed a mutual interest for the development of renewable energy. So the \n\ninternational stage and relations are set to move forward and create a deeper and more \n\nproductive partnership in renewable energy, especially in second-generation ethanol.  \n\n8.1 Suggestions \n\nA partnership between the US and Brazil to promote ethanol as a commodity has \n\nsupport from the top leaders in government from each country, for it to viably grow the \n\npartnership would probably flourish under certain premises. It does not look like ethanol will \n\nbe a complete substitute for gasoline any time soon because the structures are not in place to \n\nsupport the industry, the world is hooked on oil, and there has been widespread excitement in \n\nthe finding of new deposits of energy. What seems more feasible is a campaign of \n\ncomplimentary usage between the two fuels, showing how small vehicles run better on \n\nblended fuel and blending is better for the environment. In this way the energy matrix of each \n\ncountry is more diversified and secure. For this to be practical for the consumer, ethanol can\u2019t \n\ncompete with a heavily subsidized petroleum industry.   \n\nIn order for ethanol to be invested in there needs to be long term government blending \n\npolicies that ensure there will be a market. This can be done by private pressure on the \n\ngovernment, especially the Brazilian government, to more clearly define in the long term \n\nwhat will be ethanol\u2019s role in the energy matrix. Obama especially has demonstrated his \n\ninterest in renewable energy, and the movement towards more tangible demonstrations of \n\nhow the government supports clean energy would be the next logical step. The need is for \n\nconcrete percentages for ethanol blends in the future, not necessarily ranges that can still \n\nfluctuate, so that ethanol producers can create long-term projections on how they will meet a \n\nsecure demand. This is the foundation for investment in a growing and sustainable ethanol \n\ninternational market.   \n\nOnce the policy is in place that creates the needed security for investments, research \n\n\n\n 68 \n\ncenters can be mobilized in both the USA and Brazil to go to work on developing second-\n\ngeneration ethanol. These can include Universities as well as research institutions such as \n\nCTC and EBI. The idea of this research would be to develop the global ethanol market, not \n\njust increase production in the USA and Brazil. Increasing consumers and producers would \n\nbring new competitors to the ethanol market and in turn better the product, creating a \n\nbeneficial cycle for the market. \n\nSecond-generation ethanol also seems to show more promise for a potential \n\ncollaborations between the USA and Brazil. The pros for partnership are that the fermentation \n\nand distillation processes for each country\u2019s raw materials for second-generation ethanol is \n\nsimilar enough to have a productive technology exchange. First-generation ethanol uses raw \n\nmaterials that are debatably too distant for foreign technology to be applied for the \n\ndevelopment of the industry. Second-generation ethanol is also less of a threat to the world\u2019s \n\nfood supply so it makes more sense in the long run to look for technologies that will more \n\nefficiently extract energy from second-generation ethanol to make it more worthwhile to \n\nconsumers.  \n\n Motivation to use and develop ethanol should not come from spreading fear that other \n\nmore commonly used fuel sources will be depleted but that ethanol development diversifies \n\nthe energy portfolio of each country and is better for the environment. Diversifying their \n\nenergy matrices means that countries are hedging their energy sources, making them less \n\ndependent on single sources of energy and consequently the countries or regions that produce \n\nthese fuels. While the US may have found new deposits of petroleum there is a lot of \n\nuncertainty surrounding the quantity, quality, and cost of extraction of these energy deposits, \n\nso more dependence on petroleum could still make the US more vulnerable to oil producing \n\nregions of the world. The other advantages, that fewer tend to concretely qualify, are the \n\nenvironmental benefits. It is becoming easier every day to see the effects of damaging our \n\nenvironment, whether it is the melting polar ice caps, less stable global temperatures, etc. As \n\nthis phenomenon continues, it is more likely that social pressures and moral obligations to \n\nactively seek ways to be less damaging to the environment will increase. These attitudes will \n\nbe beneficial for the promotion of the development of ethanol. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 69 \n\n9 References \n\n1. Adams, S. (2013, March 18).
