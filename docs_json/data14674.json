The zeolite influence \n\non the electroactive ?-phase crystallization of PVDF was explored, as well as the effect \n\nof clay layered structure (Montmorillonite, Kaolinite and Laponite) on the electroactive \n\n?-phase nucleation and on the optical transparency of the composite. \n\nIt was found that the obtained composites showed an electrical response dependence on \n\nthe pore structure and chemical content of the inorganic host. The dielectric response of \n\nthe composites is directly related to the Si/Al ratio, leading zeolites with lower Si/Al \n\nratios to larger dielectric responses and encapsulation efficiencies in the composites. It \n\nwas also found that the zeolite content strongly influences the macroscopic response of \n\ndielectric response, which increases for increasing filler content. The dielectric constant \n\nat room temperature reaches values larger than 1000 for the 32 wt.% composite at 1 kHz \n\nwhat is mainly attributed to restricted ion mobility and interfacial polarization effects \n\ndue to the zeolite inclusion, leading also to high dielectric losses. For the higher zeolite \n\nconcentrations the composite d.c. electrical conductivity is characterized by two \n\nconducting regimes separated by a concentration independent breaking voltage of 4 V, \n\nwhich is associated to an intrazeolite charge transport. \n\n\n\nvi Ana Catarina Lopes \n\nDielectric relaxation studies show that the main relaxation process (?-relaxation) of the \n\namorphous phase of the polymer matrix is not affected by the presence of the zeolite \n\nand, in a similar way, the zeolite low temperature relaxation is not significantly affected \n\nby the polymer phase. On the other hand, the electric modulus formalism reveals \n\nsignificant contributions of the fillers to the electrical permittivity and conductivity of \n\nthe composites. The presence of the zeolite particles increases a.c. conductivity and the \n\nMaxwell-Wagner-Sillars contribution that is predominant at low frequencies with \n\nrespect to the ohmic contribution to permittivity. \n\nThe ability of zeolites to induce the eletroactive ?-phase nucleation of PVDF is directly \n\ndependent on the Si/Al ratio and zeolite content; however it only occurs when the \n\ncomposite is melted at temperatures below 200 \u00baC. The complete ?-phase crystallization \n\nof the polymer crystalline phase occurs for a filler content of 16 wt% of LTA or FAU \n\nzeolite structure. \n\nThe even higher surface interaction of clays when exfoliated leads to the same \n\nphenomenon with an amount of 0.50 % of Montmorillonite clay content. The \n\nelectroactivity of the material has been proven by measuring the piezoelectric d33 \n\nresponse of the material, which presents a value of ?7 pC/N, lower than for ?-PVDF \n\nobtained by mechanical stretching but still among the largest coefficients obtained for \n\npolymers. Further, the optical transmittance in the visible range is strongly enhanced \n\nwith respect to the transmittance of the pure polymer. \n\nThe development, characterization and physical-chemical understanding of these \n\nPVDF/zeolite and PVDF/clay composites resulted in suitable materials for applications \n\nin diverse areas including battery separator membranes and biomedical applications. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n Ana Catarina Lopes vii \n\nResumo \n\nOs comp\u00f3sitos polim\u00e9ricos electroativos s\u00e3o materiais muito interessantes para \n\naplica\u00e7\u00f5es tecnol\u00f3gicas devido \u00e0 possibilidade de combinar as propriedades \n\nelectroativas da matriz polim\u00e9rica com uma larga variedade de materiais que deste \n\nmodo permitem a manipula\u00e7\u00e3o das suas respostas para as fazer adequadas a aplica\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nespec\u00edficas. \n\nDe entre os poucos pol\u00edmeros electroativos, as melhores respostas s\u00e3o obtidas no \n\npoli(fluoreto de vinilideno) (PVDF) e nos seus copol\u00edmeros que, aliados \u00e0s propriedades \n\ndos materiais porosos de ze\u00f3litos, com forma, tamanho e raz\u00e3o Si/Al modific\u00e1veis, entre \n\noutras caracter\u00edsticas, leva \u00e0 possibilidade de desenvolver comp\u00f3sitos promissores de \n\nPVDF/ze\u00f3litos. \n\nDeste modo, foi efetuado um estudo das propriedades estruturais, t\u00e9rmicas e el\u00e9tricas \n\ndos comp\u00f3sitos de PVDF preparados com diferentes tipos de ze\u00f3litos (LTL, LTA, FAU \n\ne MFI), diferentes solventes do pol\u00edmero (DMF, DMSO, TEP) e diferentes \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es de ze\u00f3lito (NaY) (4, 16, 24 e 32 % em peso). \n\nFoi ainda investigada a resposta diel\u00e9trica, condutividade el\u00e9ctrica e modulo el\u00e9trico dos \n\ncomp\u00f3sitos em fun\u00e7\u00e3o da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o do ze\u00f3lito NaY. A influ\u00eancia do ze\u00f3lito na \n\ncristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o da fase electroativa ? do PVDF foi explorada, bem como o efeito da \n\nestrutura lamelar das argilas (Montmorillonite, Kaolinite e Laponite) na nuclea\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nfase-? e na transpar\u00eancia \u00f3tica do comp\u00f3sito. \n\nDescobriu-se que os comp\u00f3sitos obtidos exibiam uma resposta el\u00e9trica dependente da \n\nestrutura porosa e da composi\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica dos compostos inorg\u00e2nicos encapsulados. A \n\nresposta diel\u00e9trica dos comp\u00f3sitos est\u00e1 diretamente relacionada com a raz\u00e3o Si/Al, \n\nlevando a que os ze\u00f3litos com uma baixa raz\u00e3o Si/Al apresentem elevadas respostas \n\ndiel\u00e9tricas e maior efici\u00eancia de encapsulamento no comp\u00f3sito. Foi tamb\u00e9m descoberto \n\nque o teor de ze\u00f3lito influencia fortemente a resposta diel\u00e9trica macrosc\u00f3pica, \n\naumentando com a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de ze\u00f3litos no comp\u00f3sito. A constante diel\u00e9trica \u00e0 \n\ntemperatura ambiente atinge valores superiores a 1000 para o comp\u00f3sito com 32 % em \n\npeso de NaY a 1kHz, o que \u00e9 atribu\u00eddo principalmente \u00e0 mobilidade i\u00f3nica restrita e a \n\nefeitos de polariza\u00e7\u00e3o interfacial devido \u00e0 inclus\u00e3o de ze\u00f3lito, levando tamb\u00e9m a \n\ngrandes perdas diel\u00e9tricas. Para concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de ze\u00f3lito elevada, a condutividade \n\n\n\nviii Ana Catarina Lopes \n\nel\u00e9trica d.c. do comp\u00f3sito \u00e9 caracterizada por dois regimes de condutividade separados \n\npor um potencial de disrup\u00e7\u00e3o de 4 V, independente da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o, que est\u00e1 \n\nassociado ao transporte de carga intraze\u00f3lito. \n\nEstudos de relaxa\u00e7\u00e3o diel\u00e9trica mostram que o processo de relaxa\u00e7\u00e3o ? da fase amorfa \n\nda matriz polim\u00e9rica n\u00e3o \u00e9 afetada pela presen\u00e7a do ze\u00f3lito e, de um modo semelhante, \n\na relaxa\u00e7\u00e3o de baixa temperatura do ze\u00f3lito n\u00e3o \u00e9 afetada significativamente pela \n\npresen\u00e7a da fase polim\u00e9rica. Por outro lado, o formalismo do modulo el\u00e9trico revela \n\ncontributos relevantes das inclus\u00f5es para a permitividade el\u00e9trica e condutividade dos \n\ncomp\u00f3sitos. A presen\u00e7a das part\u00edculas de ze\u00f3lito aumenta a condutividade a.c. e a \n\ncontribui\u00e7\u00e3o Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars que predomina a baixas frequ\u00eancias \n\nrelativamente \u00e0 contribui\u00e7\u00e3o ohmica para a permitividade. \n\nA capacidade dos ze\u00f3litos induzirem a nuclea\u00e7\u00e3o da fase eletroativa ? do PVDF \n\ndepende diretamente da raz\u00e3o Si/Al e da quantidade de ze\u00f3lito; contudo, apenas se \n\nverifica quando o comp\u00f3sito \u00e9 fundido a temperaturas inferiores a 200 \u00baC. A \n\ncristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o completa em fase ? pode ocorrer para uma concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de 16% das \n\nestruturas de ze\u00f3lito LTA ou FAU. \n\nA ainda maior superf\u00edcie de interac\u00e7\u00e3o das argilas, quando exfoliadas, resulta no mesmo \n\nfen\u00f3meno com uma concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de 0.5% de argila Montmorillonite. A eletroatividade \n\ndo material foi comprovada atrav\u00e9s da medi\u00e7\u00e3o da resposta piezoel\u00e9trica d33 do \n\nmaterial, que apresenta um valor de \u20137 pC/N, mais baixo do que o de ?-PVDF obtido \n\npor estiramento mec\u00e2nico mas ainda entre os maiores coeficientes piezoel\u00e9tricos obtidos \n\npara pol\u00edmeros. Mais ainda, a transmit\u00e2ncia \u00f3tica na gama vis\u00edvel \u00e9 fortemente \n\nmelhorada relativamente \u00e0 transmit\u00e2ncia do pol\u00edmero puro. \n\nO desenvolvimento, caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o e compreens\u00e3o f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmica destes comp\u00f3sitos \n\nPVDF/ze\u00f3lito e PVDF/argila resultou em materiais adequados para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es em \u00e1reas \n\ndiversas que incluem membranas para baterias e aplica\u00e7\u00f5es biom\u00e9dicas. \n\n  \n\n\n\n Ana Catarina Lopes ix \n\nTable of contents \n\n1.

Introduction \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes 3 \n\n1.1. Electroactive polymers \n\nElectroactive polymers are one of the most interesting classes of polymers used as smart \n\nmaterials. Its ability to respond to an electrical stimulation with large displacement \n\nmakes them appropriate for the use in an increasing number of applications including \n\nsensors, actuators, energy harvesting and as biomaterials in the biomedical field, among \n\nothers [1, 2] Piezo, pyro and ferroelectricity are three of its more important properties. \n\nPiezoelectricity consists on the variation of the polarization of the material when \n\nmechanically stressed or on the development of a mechanical strain when an electric \n\nfield is applied. Pyroelectricity consists on the variation of the polarization of the \n\nmaterial as a response to a variation of temperature. Finally ferroelectricity corresponds \n\nto the characteristic of the material of having stable polarization that can be hysterically \n\nswitched by an electric field [3].  \n\nAlthough the piezoelectric and pyroelectric coefficients of polymers are generally lower \n\nthan those of ceramic and single crystals, polymer and polymer based composites have \n\nadvantages for specific applications related to their low permittivity, low thermal \n\nconductivity, softness and flexibility, good impedance matching to air and water and \n\nrelatively low cost.  \n\nAmong the few polymers presenting piezo, pyro or ferroelectricity, such as Nylon\u201311 \n\n[4], PLLA [5] and PLGA [6], Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its copolymers \n\nhave the best all-around electroactive properties, being therefore the polymer of choice \n\nfor an increasing number of applications [7, 8]. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) \n\nThis semi-crystalline polymer shows a complex structure and can present five distinct \n\ncrystalline phases related to different chain conformations designed as all trans (TTT) \n\nplanar zigzag for the ?-phase, TGTG\u00b4 (trans-gauche-trans-gauche) for the ? and ? \n\nphases and T3GT3G\u00b4 for ? and ? phases [7]. Figure 1.1 shows the chain conformation of \n\nthe most investigated phases of PVDF used for applications: ?, ? and ?-phases. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n4 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 Schematic representation of the chain conformation for the ?, ? and ? phases of PVDF. \n\n \n\nMany of the interesting properties of PVDF, in particular those related with its use as \n\nsensor or actuator, are related to the strong electrical dipole moment of the PVDF \n\nmonomer unit (5-8x10\n-30\n\n C?m) which is due to the electronegativity of fluorine atoms as \n\ncompared to those of hydrogen and carbon atoms [9-10]. In this way, each chain \n\npossesses a dipole moment perpendicular to the polymer chain. The monomer units and \n\ntherefore the dipolar moments are then packed in a morphology which can show an \n\noverall dipolar contribution per unit cell as in the polar ?, ? and ? phases. The ?-phase is \n\nthe one with the highest dipolar moment per unit cell (8x10\n-30\nC?m) when compared to \n\nthe ? and ? phases [11]. The ? and ? phases are non-polar due to antiparallel packing of \n\nthe dipoles within the unit cell [12]. Since the ? and ? phases are the most electrically \n\nactive phases, their promotion within the material is an on-going pursuit [13] due to the \n\nstrong interest in application areas such as sensors, actuators, batteries, filters, chemical \n\nwarfare protection, magnetoelectric, and, more recently, in the biomedical field [14-17]. \n\nThe ?-phase is the most easily and commonly obtained by melt and crystallization at \n\nroom temperature. It presentssuitable mechanical properties and chemical degradation \n\nresistance [7].  \n\nThe ?-phase is the one that presents the best piezoelectric, pyroelectric and ferroelectric \n\nproperties[7] and is most commonly obtained by mechanical stretching of the ?-phase \n\n[9], or from solution crystallization at temperatures below 70 \no\nC [17], however, in this \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes 5 \n\ncase,it presents very fragile mechanical properties. PVDF ?-phase can also be \n\nobtainedfrom melt under specific conditions such as high pressure [18], external electric \n\nfield [16] and  ultra-fast cooling [19]; or by the addition of nucleating fillers such as \n\nBaTiO3 [20], clay [21], hydrated ionic salt [22], PMMA [23], TiO2 [24] or nanoparticles \n\nsuch as ferrite [24], palladium [25] or gold [26]. Also the development of PVDF \n\ncopolymers such as poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE), Figure \n\n1.2., has allowed to obtain the material in the electroactive phase [27], once the addition \n\nof the third fluoride in the TrFE monomer unit with a large steric hindrance, favors the \n\nall-trans conformation and induces the ferroelectric ?-phase independently of the used \n\nprocessing method: melt or solution casting. This situation occurs when the VDF \n\ncontent is between 50 and 80 % [28], corresponding also to the ferroelectric behavior of \n\nthe copolymer. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 Schematic representation of the P(VDF-TrFE) \n\n \n\nThe ?-phase is also piezoelectric but this effect is weaker when compared to ?-phase \n\nPVDF due the presence of a gauche bond every fourth repeat  C-C units [29]. \n\nSimilarly to what happens with the ?-phase, the ?-phase of PVDF is difficult to obtain \n\nexcepting through melt crystallization at high temperatures and at very slow cooling \n\nrates, with an ? or ? to ? solid state phase transformation by annealing at temperatures \n\nclose to melt temperature [30] or with the addition of fillers [29]. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n6 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n1.3. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) composites \n\nDespite the interesting electroactive and mechanical properties of PVDF, ideal for the \n\ndemands of novel technological applications that includes flexible, simple fabricated \n\nand easy shaped smart materials, this polymer still present a much low piezoelectric \n\nresponse when compared with materials such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and \n\nbarium BaTiO3 [31]. In order to bring added value and to improve its performance, the \n\ncombination of PVDF polymer with suitable fillers has been pursued. \n\nFor improving the electroactive response of PVDF, materials displaying high \n\npiezoelectricity and ferroelectric properties have been incorporated in the polymer. \n\nSimultaneously, the combination of the polymer matrix with the filler, either due to the \n\nhigh dielectric constant of the filler or by surface effects and matrix-filler interactions \n\nleads to the increase of dielectric properties that, in turn, improves the energy density of \n\nthe composite when compared to the neat polymer. When compared to the conventional \n\ndielectric materials, such as ceramics and single crystals, polymer composites present \n\nhigh mechanical flexibility and ability to be molded on the desired shapes [32].  \n\nPZT, a ceramic with high piezoelectric coefficient and dielectric constant and low \n\ndielectric and mechanical loses was added to PVDF polymer and the results shows a \n\ncomposite with an increase of almost 10 times in the dielectric constant when compared \n\nwith the pure polymer [33]. Results obtained with the introduction of other ceramics \n\nsuch as BaTiO3 as well as Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) point in the same \n\ndirection [34, 35]. Further, BaTiO3 can stimulate the nucleation of the electroactive \n\nphase of PVDF, reaching ?-phase fractions up to 82% [20]. However, despite the \n\nincrease of dielectric constant, the ceramic loading deteriorates the mechanical qualities \n\nof the composite and prevents its use in many technological applications.  \n\nMetal nanoparticles have been also introduced in the polymer matrix. The metal \n\nintroduction causes an increase of the dielectric constant due the interfacial polarization \n\nphenomena due to collective oscillation of nanoparticles electrons called surface \n\nplasmon resonances (SPR). This effect is detected even for small loadings of \n\nnanoparticles by an increase of many orders of magnitude of the optical absorption \n\nspectra of the materials, that in turn is dependent on polymer and nanoparticle types, as \n\nwell as nanoparticles size, shape, distribution and orientation [36, 37]. In this way, the \n\nintroduction of Ag nanoparticles in PVDF lead to an increase of the dielectric constant \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes 7 \n\nfrom 7 up to 26 with a particle loading of only 0.020 wt% [38] and up to 120 with a \n\nparticle loading of 20 vol % [39]. Despite Ag being the metal nanoparticle with the \n\nmost intensive resonance absorption in the visible region due to the favourable \n\nfrequency dependence of the dielectric constant [40], other metals exhibit similar \n\nbehaviour. Silver nanoparticles also play an important role in the nucleation of the \n\nelectroactive phase of PVDF. The electrostatic interactions between the negative surface \n\ncharges of the Ag nanoparticles and the dipolar groups of the polymer chains leads to \n\nthe direct formation of the electroactive PVDF ?-phase from solvent casting and melt \n\ncrystallization. The efficiency of this crystallization is dependent from the particle size \n\nand concentration and elimination of processing steps such as mechanical stretching or \n\nannealing makes these composites ideal for applications in flexible electronics and \n\nmicrofabrication [41]. Other particles present similar effect on the PVDF electroactive \n\nphase cristallization. This is the case of magnetoelectric ferrite nanoparticles, such as \n\nCOFe2O4, NiFe2O4 and NiZnFe2O4 [42]. Also in these cases it is shown that the static \n\nelectric interaction between the negative zeta potential of the magnetic particles and the \n\ndipole moments of the polymer chain is the responsible for the electroactive phase \n\nnucleation [43]. Furthermore, these composites present magnetoelectric effect that \n\nallows applications in the area of sensors and actuators [44]. \n\nCarbon nanotubes and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) have also been added \n\nto PVDF and used for mechanical reinforcement and increasing the electrical \n\nconductivity. The studies show that permittivity, electrical conductivity and thermal \n\nconductivity increases with increasing of carbon and MWNT content and that this filler \n\nalso acts as a nucleation agent that induces the enhancing ?-phase crystals formation in \n\nPVDF [45]. \n\nAmong the large variety of materials used as fillers for PVDF are also found the \n\nalluminosilicates. They have been traditionally used to increase the mechanical \n\nperformance and thermal stability of polymers [46, 47], but nowadays, the incorporation \n\nof aluminosilicates leads to new application areas due to their tailoring properties: high \n\nsurface area, ion exchange capacity, different shape and size and the capacity of \n\nmolecule encapsulation in the 3D structure.They result from the combination of oxygen \n\nwith silicon and aluminium originating a wide range of chains, rings, layers and three-\n\ndimentional arrays. Thus, despite all aluminosilicates share the same basic chemical \n\ncomposition, the different arrangement of atoms and molecules leads to structures with \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n8 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\nalso different physical properties. Nowadays, natural or synthetic, there exist a large \n\nnumber of different aluminosilicates among which stand out clays, zeolites and \n\nmesoporous aluminosilicates due to their several applications. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.4. Aluminosilicates \n\n \n\n1.4.1. Layered aluminosilicates \n\nClays are layered aluminosilicated formed by the arrangement of two different sheets: \n\none consists on tetrahedral SiO4 units, where each Si atom shares one of its O atoms \n\nwith a second sheet which in turn consists on aluminiun in octahedral co-ordination \n\nrepresented as AlO6. There are two different sheets structures. The 1:1 structure consists \n\non an octahedral sheet, that is held to other sheet by hydrogen bonding that holds the \n\nsheets tightly together, fact that stops the insertion of water molecules or ions between \n\nthe sheets and hinders the expansion of the material when it is wet [48] (Figure 1.3 a). \n\nOn the other hand, on the 2:1 structure, one AlO6 octahedral sheet is sandwiched \n\nbetween two AlO4 tetrahedral sheets by covalent bonding. This layer structure can \n\npresent an expanding (Figure 1.3 b) or non-expanding lattice (Figure 1.3 c). In some \n\nclay, there is a considerable substitution of aluminum by silicon that can go up to 15 %. \n\nFurther, magnesium and iron can also substitute aluminum in the octahedral sheet. \n\nThese substitutions create an overall negative charge on the layers that is balanced by \n\nwater molecules and ions such as K\n+\n, Ca\n\n2+\n and Mg\n\n2+\n, providing the layered \n\naluminosilicates of  ion exchange capacity [48, 49]. Water and ions hold layers together \n\nby relatively weak forces, allowing the water and other polar molecules to enter \n\nbetween the unit layers what, in turn, causes the expansion of the lattice [50]. On the \n\nother hand, in some clays the interlayer cation is potassium, which size, charge and \n\ncoordination number allows it to fit snugly in the hexagonal rings of oxygens of the two \n\nadjacent silica tetrahedral sheets. This fact results in a strong interlocking ionic bond, \n\nkeeping the layers together and precluding water molecules to occupy the interlayer \n\nposition[49]. \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes 9 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3 Scheme of clay layer structure: (a) 1:1, (b) 2:1 expanding lattice, (c) 2:1 non expanding lattice \n\n \n\nThe use of clays is transversal to many areas. It can be used as a geopolymer material in \n\nthe production of geopolymer brick due its significant impact on the strength of the \n\nmaterial [51] as well as in cosmetic treatments as a therapeutic option for facial \n\nrejuvenation [52]. Clays have been extensively used in the area of drilling muds [53] \n\nand foundry muds as well as for paper coating with the aim to control paper surface \n\nmorphology, optical and physical properties as well as printing properties [54]. The use \n\nof clays has also been extensive in the area of catalysis, playing a central role in the \n\nprocessing of crude oil in the mid-twentieth century [55] and later on catalytic cracking \n\nof heavy oil [56]. Nowadays, clays are being used as catalysts in the green synthesis of \n\nchemicals and also for the removal of pollutants. This large interest for catalysis \n\napplication arises because clays present inherent features in composition and structures \n\nthat results in large surface areas, swelling, ion exchange and active broken-edge bonds. \n\nFurthermore, besides the characteristics of their framework, clays can be modified \n\naccording to the intended application. The ions within the interlayer space can be \n\nexchanged with active components for catalysis purposes [57], functional nanoparticles \n\ncan be incorpored into or onto clay structures [58] and clays can be used as a catalysis \n\nsupports [59]. For catalysis applications also synthetic clays can be used since their \n\nformulations and structure can be designed and controlled depending on and the  \n\npreparation conditions [60]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(b) (a) (c) \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n10 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n1.4.2. Three-dimensional aluminosilicates \n\nDifferent fromthe clay layered structure, zeolites consist on three-dimensional \n\nframework structures (Figure 1.4) formed by the combination of TO4 tetrahedra (T = Si, \n\nAl) linked to each other by sharing all the oxygen atoms, forming uniform and \n\nmolecular-sized pores and channels. In a silica structure all T of the TO4 tetrahedra \n\ncorresponds to Si atoms and the solid is uncharged. However, when a silicon atom is \n\nreplaced by an aluminum atom, the electronic relationship between (SiO2)2 and \n\n[AlSiO4]\n- \nleads the framework to become negatively charged and requires the balance of \n\nan extra-framework cations within the structure to ensure overall framework neutrality \n\n[61]. This variation from a pure-silica zeolite to a low-silica zeolite transforms an \n\nhydrophobic, acid stable and no ion exchange capacity material into an hydrophilic, acid \n\nsoluble and high ion exchange capacity one [62]. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.4 Different zeolite type structures [63] \n\n \n\nZeolites and their well-organized system of pores and cavities, with a very high surface \n\narea and pore volume, are an ideal matrix for hosting nanosized particles and small \n\nmolecules. However, this is dependent on the pore diameter of the zeolite largest \n\nchannel entrance, which in turn is dependent on the smallest number of O or T atoms \n\nthat limits it [64]. In this way, conventionally, channel sizesare classified in ultra large, \n\nlarge, medium or small pore material when they are formed by >12, 12, 10 or 8 member \n\nrings, respectively, resulting in diameter variations between 5 and 20    [64]. \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes 11 \n\nPresent everyday on household detergents with the aim of reducing water hardness by \n\npartial removal of calcium and magnesium ions [65], zeolites are increasingly used \n\nmainly due to their suitable characteristics for gas storage and separation and catalysis. \n\nThe characteristics of zeolites makes them interesting for the area of gas storage since \n\nthe high pressures and liquefaction processes can be avoided, allowing easier \n\ntransportation and storage [66]. This situation includes the storage of hydrogen [67] as \n\nwell as the absorption of CO2, CH4, N2O and N2 [68]. The absorbance capacity of gases \n\nis related to the zeolite structure modifications and the chemical nature of ions present \n\nin the zeolite structure. Ion-exchange allows controlling the diameter of the cages and \n\nchannels by the modification of valence state and the size of the exchangeable cations, \n\nwhich in turn controls the available void space and the accessibility of molecules to the \n\ninternal cavity [67]. The absorption capacity of zeolites is also a function of the physical \n\nproperties of the gases, which includes their polarizability, the dipole moments and \n\nquadrupole moments as well as the specific adsorbate-adsorbent interactions. These \n\ndifferent interaction allows not only the control of accumulation and storage of gases in \n\nthe zeolites but also their separation [69].  \n\n In this sense, the separation of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) produced \n\nduring the anaerobic treatment of biomassa and natural gas is required and many studies \n\nwith different zeolites have already focused on this fact [70]. \n\n \n\n1.4.3. Other aluminossilicate structures \n\nDespite the interesting properties of zeolites, the presence of micropores in their \n\nstructure imposes intracrystalline diffusion limitations, that includes the obstruction to \n\nthe use of bulky molecules on catalytic reactions and the reduction of process rates [71]. \n\nTo solve this problem, mesoporous aluminosilicates have attracted much attention in \n\nrelation with macromolecules [72]. These materials with a mesoporous structure show a \n\nrelatively low acidity, hydrothermal stability and ion exchange capacity, limiting their \n\nuse in catalytic reactions. These facts can be attributed to the amorphous nature of the \n\npore wall present in most mesoporous aluminosilicates, since the preparation conditions \n\nrequired to generate mesoporosity do not generally favor the formation of a crystalline \n\naluminosilicate framework [61]. However, some recent studies shows that it is possible \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n12 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\nto achieve crystalline mesoporous aluminosilicates allowing the combination of the \n\nadvantages of zeolites and mesoporous materials [72]. \n\nOther possibilities include hierarchiral zeolites (Figure1.5), consisting on materials with \n\nmultiple levels of porosity, that combine the microporosity and acidity of zeolites with \n\nthe easier accessibility of mesoporous materials [71]. They can be prepared by direct \n\nsynthesis when secondary templates are added [73], inducing mesoporosity, or by post-\n\nsynthesis treatment, that result on a partial destruction of the crystals [74].  \n\n \n\nFigure 1.5 Schematic illustration of zeolite and a hierarchically nanoporous zeolite \n\n \n\nDiverse studies demonstrated an improved of catalysis performance associated with the \n\nenhanced of mass transport obtained with hierarchical porous materials such as ZSM-5 \n\n[75, 76] and hierarchical porous materials obtained from FAU, LTA [77]and MFI [78] \n\ntype zeolites, among others. Finally, \u201ctwo-dimentional zeolites\u201d area also being \n\ndeveloped, consisting on zeolite materials composed by layers with one-two unit cell (2-\n\n3 nm) thickness [79, 80]. The first 2D zeolite was MCM-22 [81], but since there other \n\nlayered zeolites were obtained, such as FER [82], SOD [83] and MFI [84]. An example \n\nof layered arrangement on a \u201ctwo-dimensional zeolite\u201d structure is illustrated in Figure \n\n1.6. Large pore zeolites with more than12 rings, ideal for large molecules catalyses that \n\nwere limited to its one-dimensional system, can now improve significantly its \n\nperformance if synthesized on the 2D structure.  \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes 13 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.6 Example illustration of layer arrangement on a \u201ctwo-dimensional zeolites\u201d [85] \n\n \n\nOn this kind of zeolites the absorption and catalyses occurs mainly on the materials \n\nsurface and not in their pores. They exhibit a much large surface area when compared to \n\nmesoporous materials and their large and well organized external surface of thermally \n\nstable zeolitic crystals makes acid centres accessible to large molecules that, \n\nsimultaneously, will be sterically limited by the channel entrances of conventional \n\nzeolites [80, 86]. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.5. Polymer/aluminosilicate composites \n\nAs previously mentioned, there are several physical and structural features of \n\naluminosilicates such as their excellent chemical and thermal stability that can be \n\nexploited for the production of composites. \n\nThe area of polymer/aluminosilicates composites has been growing since the first \n\npolymer composite was created on Toyota Central Research laboratories with the \n\nproduction of a nylon 6/clay composite with enhanced physical properties \n\ncomparatively to the pure polymer, what includes the increase of tensile strength, \n\nmodulus and heat distortion temperature without loss of impact strength [87]. Since \n\nthere many different polymers and clays have been investigated, being determined that \n\nthe clays exfoliation is crucial for the improvement of the physical properties of the \n\ncomposites. Exfoliation, in turn, depends on the way in which composites are prepared, \n\nby situ polarization or by melt compounding, and from the kind of clays pretreatment, \n\norganically or no organically modified clays [50, 88], that is performed with the aim to \n\ncompatibilize the hydrophilic surface of the clay with the hydrophobic polymer matrix \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n14 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n[89]. A graphical representation of the possible structures of polymer/clay composites is \n\nrepresented in Figure 1.7. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.7 Scheme of possible structure of polymer clay composite. \n\n \n\nExfoliation leads to a high contact between the two phases of the composite, resulting \n\non the improvement of materials barrier properties since the permeating molecules have \n\nto wiggle around the impermeable particles introduced in the polymer, increasing the \n\nresistance to the gas molecules penetration. Barrier properties increase was tested in a \n\nwide range of polymers including epoxies [90], siloxanes [91], polyureas [92] and PVA \n\n[93]. Thermal stability and flame resistance of polymers also increase in polymer/clay \n\ncomposites. In these cases, clay acts as a barrier for mass transport of volatile products \n\nreleased during the degradation process. The addition of a small amount of clay is \n\nenough to induce a significant decrease in the peak heat release rate, as well as in the \n\nmass loss rate during combustion [50, 94]. In this way, polymer/clay compositesare \n\nvery useful in a variety of industrial applications from automotive [95, 96], construction \n\n[97] and aerospace [98] to food packaging [99] and textiles [100]. \n\nPolymer/aluminosilicate composites have extended their application range to other \n\nareas, including sensors, biomedical and membrane areas.  \n\nAluminosilicates have been used to improve the performance of polymer sensors, as \n\nwell as being used themselves as the sensing medium [101]. Their absorptivity, high-\n\nsurface area, presence of mobile ions, catalytic activity and porosity make them \n\nattractive candidates for numerous applications as chemical sensors [102]. Many \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes 15 \n\nexamples can be found for pollutants in drinking water or toxic [103] and flammable \n\ngases [104], however, despite the large body of research literature on \n\npolymer/aluminosilicate environmental sensors, few practical, commercial systems  \n\nhave emerged to date, being  selectivity the primary limitation [104]. \n\nPolymer/aluminosilicate based sensors can also be useful as biosensors for the \n\nmeasurement of toxins in agricultural commodities, human food and animal feed \n\nthereby helping on avoiding toxic and carcinogenic effects on human and animal health. \n\nPolymer/aluminosilicate biosensors can additionally detect important bioparameters \n\nsuch as urea and glucose in humans [105]. In this area of biomedical applications, there \n\nis growing interest in zeolites, for their use in drug delivery [106], as carriers of low \n\nmolecular bioactive substances and macromolecules for in-cell chemistry [107], as MRI \n\ncontrast agents [108], hemostatic materials [109], cell culture [110], osteo-regeneration \n\n[111]and most recently as a vehicle to store and release Nitric oxide, a molecule that has \n\nlong been established as a signalling material to promote the relaxation of smooth \n\nmuscle cells [112].  \n\nPolymer based aluminosilicates composites can also bring an added value in the area of \n\ncell culture and tissue engineering [113]. These materials consist in an innovative \n\napproach in regenerative medicine due to their biocompatibility and cation exchange \n\nability. In addition to that, these composites can be transparent, flexible and elastic. \n\nThey can be prepared into various shapes, such as thin films, rods, spheres and hollow \n\ntubes and are being used in many in vivo or in vitro applications [113-114]. Relatively \n\nto 3D aluminosilicate structures, although it is well known that zeolites have interesting \n\neffects on bone structure such as its ability to stimulate bone formation and inhibition of \n\nbone loss [115] is easily observable in the literature the lack of studies regarding the \n\nexploitation of these properties of zeolites in polymer composites, which could take \n\nadvantage of the unique features of biocompatible polymers [116]. \n\nFinally, polymer/aluminosilicates composites have also been used in the development of \n\nmembranes. Polymer and polymer composite separator electrolytes membranes have \n\nattracted considerable attention in recent years due the specific characteristic of \n\npolymers such as electronic insulation, minimal electrolyte (ionic) resistance, \n\ncompatibility with electrodes, mechanical and dimensional stability, among others, that \n\nare being improved with the introduction of specific aluminosilicates [117]. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n16 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\nThere are many studies on conventional membranes for the separation of gases, ions, \n\nsolutes or water, nevertheless such membranes have micro voids or free volumes of \n\nbroad size originating a lower perm-selective nature. This problem can be solved with \n\nthe use of ordered polymers [118]. The performance of the membrane can be further \n\nimproved by the addition of aluminosilicates that will benefit the mechanical and \n\nstructural properties of the resulting composites [119]. Additionally zeolites can \n\nenhanced the membrane selectivity by increasing transport of solvent molecules and \n\nexcluding sterically the larger solutes [120].This controls the transfer by the polymeric \n\nmembrane combined with the catalytic properties of zeolite, making possible to obtain \n\npolymer catalytic membrane reactors [121], and to combine two distinct functions \n\n(reaction and separation). Due to its crystalline nature, aluminosilicates with their \n\nexcellent hydrothermal stability and chemical resistance to withstand the conditions of a \n\nreaction environment can substantially improve the features of the pure polymeric \n\ncatalytic membrane reactors [122]. \n\n  \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes 17 \n\n1.6. Objectives \n\nOnce enumerated the interesting characteristics and application potential of \n\npolymer/aluminosilicate composites, the main objective of this work is the development \n\nof new polymer composites suitable for advanced applications in areas such as sensor \n\nand actuators and energy storage. These composites will be produced and the origin of \n\nthe effects investigated. In particular, the main scientific objectives of the project will \n\nbe: \n\n1. Develop new composites based on electroactive polymers with different porous \n\nstructures of zeolites and clays. \n\n2. Get a deeper knowledge of the physical origin of the dielectric, mechanical, \n\nthermal and electromechanical properties of the composites. \n\n3. Obtain a relationship between the structural and microscopic properties of the \n\nmaterials, processing conditions and their macroscopic response. \n\n4. Determine the applicability of these new materials. \n\n \n\nAlso relevant objective of the project is to produce and create know-how in materials \n\nwith large technological impact with the possibility of rapid technology transfer. In this \n\nway, the implementation of these materials into old products with improved properties \n\nor the development of new products will be possible. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n\n18 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n1.7. Structure and methodology \n\nThe present work is divided intoeight chapters that intend to provide a comprehensive \n\nand logic report of the progress achieved during this investigation.Sixof these chapters \n\nare based on published scientific papers on the development of composites of PVDF \n\nwith different porous structures of three dimensional(zeolites) and two \n\ndimensional(clays) aluminosilicates. \n\nIn Chapter 1 it is presented the state of the art on PVDF polymer, aluminosilicates and \n\ntheir composites. \n\nThe next three chapters, report on the influence of several parameters on the \n\nmorphology of the composites, their electrical, therma, optical and mechanical \n\nproperties, as well as in the polymer electroactive ?-phase crystallization. The studied \n\nparameters include the three dimensional aluminosilicate(zeolite) shape, size and Si/Al \n\nrate, by the use of zeolite framework types LTL, LTA, FAU and MFI (Chapter 2), the \n\npolymer solvent (Chapter 3) and the NaY zeolite content (Chapter 4). Chapter 5 \n\ncomplete this investigation with a deep study of the electrical response of PVDF/NaY \n\ncomposites. \n\nChapter 6 reports on the study of PVDF composites with a two dimensional layered \n\nstructure (clays), what results in a higher surface contact area between the filler and the \n\npolymer. Electrical, optical and the crystallization process were investigated, mainly \n\nfocused on PVDF/Montmorillonite clay composites. \n\nChapter 7 summarizes some results on on-going PVDF/aluminosilicates composites \n\napplication developments. Finally, Chapter 8 presents the overall conclusions and the \n\nsuggestions for the future work. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes 19 \n\n1.8. References \n\n1.

Journal of \n\nMaterials Science. 2013. 48: 2199-2206 \n\n\n\n\n\nInfluence of zeolite structure and che mistry on the electrical and crystallization response  \n\n29 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n \n\n2.1. Introdution \n\nThe combination of polymers with a large variety of fillers has been used to tailor the  \n\nmacroscopic response of materials towards specific goals for applications [1, 2]. \n\nPoly(vinylidene fluoride), PVDF, has been widely used for advanced technological \n\napplications due to its pyro- and piezoelectric properties [3], that makes it suitable for \n\nsensors and actuators, among others [4]. Among the different fillers that can be \n\nincorporated into PVDF in order to tailor mechanical, thermal and electrical response of \n\nthe material, are the zeolites, particles with a a rigid three-dimensional framework of \n\ntetrahedral       \n   and       \n\n   primary building units, forming channels and cavities \n\nwith sizes in the range of molecular dimensions. Zeolites can entrap molecules allowing \n\ntheir diffusion, adsorption and reaction within the channel system [5]. In addition to \n\nwell defined pores of precise and uniform size, zeolite structures generally show an \n\nexcess of negative charge that is compensated by cations which exist within the cages \n\nand channels.  These characteristics have lead zeolites to be used in applications such as \n\ncatalytic cracking [6], drug delivery systems [7], membranes [8], gas sensors [9], host-\n\nguest antenna material [10], etc. \n\nWith respect to the investigation on PVDF/zeolite composites, it has been mainly \n\nfocused on the development of filtration or ionic conductivity membranes for fuel cell \n\napplications [11]. However, it has been shown that the presence of NaY zeolite with a \n\nfaujasite structure on the PVDF matrix gives origin to many others yet unexplored \n\npossibilities. For example, the presence of NaY in the polymer matrix induces the \n\ncrystallization of the polymer in one of its electroactive phases [12], avoiding additional \n\nprocessing steps as stretching or application of high electric fields in order to obtain the \n\nelectroactive phase and allowing therefore miniaturization and incorporation into \n\nmicroelectronic systems. Further, it was also shown that the inclusion of zeolite fillers \n\nalso modifies the electrical behaviour of the composite [13, 14]. The dielectric constant \n\nincreases with respect to the pure polymer, fact that is dependent on the number of \n\ncations in the zeolite structure as well as from the molecules encapsulated in the zeolite \n\ncavities [13] as well as on the zeolite content [14]. In addition, the overall electrical \n\nconductivity of the composites is also increased due to intrazeolite charge transport [12, \n\n14]. Due to these developments and the large application potential of PVDF/zeolite \n\ncomposites, it is necessary to investigate the effect of different zeolites structures with \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n30 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\nvarying Si/Al ratio, cavity size and shape in order to evaluate the main zeolite \n\nparameters influencing composite macroscopic response. In the present work, zeolites \n\nY, L, A and ZSM-5 were synthesized and used for the production of PVDF composites \n\nin order to better understand the effect of different zeolite structures on the electrical \n\nresponse and thermal stability of the composites, as well as their influence in the \n\nnucleation of the electroactive phase of PVDF. In this way, this research is relevant as, \n\ntogether with a fundamental knowledge on these PVDF/zeolite systems, will allow to \n\nbetter tailor materials properties for specific applications. \n\n \n\n2.2. Experimental \n\nZeolite Y was prepared by dissolving 0.5 g of Na2SiO3 (Aldrich) and 0.1 g of Al(O-i-\n\nPr)3 (Aldrich) in 20 g of distilled water. The crystallization was carried out at 95 \no\nC for \n\n24 h. Zeolite A was prepared as follows: 0.5 g of Al (Aldrich) was dissolved in alkaline \n\nsolution of 1 g NaOH and 10 g of distilled water. Subsequently, 1g of SiO2 dissolved in \n\na solution of 1g of NaOH and 10g of distilled water was added. The obtained gel was \n\nhomogenized and heated at 90 \no\nC for 24 h. The initial batch for the synthesis of zeolite \n\nL was prepared by dissolving 1.5 g of Al2(SO4)2 (Aldrich) in a solution of 3.61 g of \n\nKOH and 35 g of distilled water and adding 9.05 g of SiO2 (Ludox) and 15.5 g distilled \n\nwater. The resulted gel was homogenized for 24 h and the synthesis was carried out at \n\n180 \no\nC for 72 h.. Nanosized ZSM-5 was prepared by mixing under vigorous stirring of \n\n8.5 g TPAOH (Aldrich, 1M in H2O), 5 g TEOS (Aldrich) and 5.18 g distilled water. The \n\nsynthesis was carried out at 114 \no\nC for 144 h.

Results and Discussion \n\n \n\n2.3.1. Microstructural Features \n\nSEM images of the synthesized zeolite particles are shown in Figure 2.1 (a-d) where the \n\ndifferent geometries and sizes are observed. The main characteristic of the zeolites are \n\nsummarized in Table 2.1. The zeolite with the most specific geometry is the L zeolite: \n\nwhereas all other zeolites show a three dimensional structure, the L zeolite present \n\ncrystals with a parallel one-dimensional channel system [15]. \n\nThe surface SEM images of the different polymer/zeolite composites are represented in \n\nFigures 2.1 (e-h). Similarly to the neat PVDF, the composites show a spherulitic \n\nmicrostructure, however its size and shape vary with the different zeolites. The \n\nspherulites of Y, ZSM-5 and A composites are well defined, being the spherulites of Y \n\ncomposites smaller when compared with those of A composite. On the other hand, the \n\ncomposites obtained from L do not show a well defined spherulite structure. \n\n \n\n    \n\n    \n\nFigure 2.1 SEM image of Y, A, L and ZSM-5 zeolites and surface SEM images of the corresponding \n\nPVDF/Y, PVDF/A, PVDF/L and PVDF/ZSM-5 composites \n\n \n\nThe spherulite size reflects the crystallization kinetics of the polymer from the melt, the \n\nspherulite size being determined both by the nucleation ability of the fillers and by the \n\ngrowth rate of the spherulites. Zeolites Y and L acted as the most effective nucleation \n\nagents increasing the number of nucleation points, resulting therefore in smaller \n\n2 ?m 2 ?m 2 ?m 2 ?m \n\nY A L ZSM-5 \n\n20 ?m 20 ?m 20 ?m 20 ?m \n\nPVDF/Y PVDF/A PVDF/L PVDF/ZSM-5 \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n34 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\nspherulites due to limited space for non-perturbed growth [16, 17]. On the other hand \n\nthe zeolites A and the ZSM-5 gave origin to composites with big and well defined \n\nspherulites close to the ones obtained for PVDF [18] (Figure 2.1). The average surface \n\narea of the used zeolites increases in the following order: LTL > MFI > LTA > FAU \n\n[19, 20]. In this context, the zeolites with the lowest and highest surface area acted as \n\nthe most effective nucleation agents and no direct relationship between surface area and \n\nnucleation efficiency is obtained. On the other hand, zeolite L is the only sample that \n\nhas 1D porous system and K\n+\n charge compensation cations and zeolites L and Y are \n\nalso the ones with  12-ring openings which can contribute to the more facile cation \n\nmovement and possible interaction with the polymer. Furthermore, the pore system of \n\nzeolite L is composed of straight channels and the one of zeolite Y is built of cages that \n\ncan also influence the mobility of the charge compensation cations. An important factor \n\ninfluencing nucleation is the Si/Al ratio, as for the zeolites L, A and  Y with Si/Al \n\nrations between 1 and 3 show that higher Si content contributes to smaller spherulites. \n\nNevertheless, the sample ZSM-5 built only by SiO4 tetrahedra and therefore with no \n\ncompensating cations showed the lowest influence in PVDF crystallization kinetics. In \n\nthis way, it can be concluded that large pores with narrow distribution together with the \n\nnature of the charge compensation cations favor higher nucleation efficiency and \n\ntherefore smaller spherulites. \n\n \n\n2.3.2. Polymer phase quantification \n\nThe presence of fillers within the PVDF matrix can serve as crystallization directors to \n\npromote the crystallization of specific phases of the polymer [21-23]. The crystallization \n\nof PVDF in an electroactive phase in the presence of layered aluminosilicates has been \n\nreported [21, 23]. In a similar way. it was also demonstrated that the three-dimensional \n\naluminosilicate NaY also induces the crystallization of the ?-phase of PVDF [12]. FTIR \n\nmeasurements were performed on the prepared composites in order to evaluate the \n\ncrystalline phase of the polymer (Figure 2.2 (a)) as specific vibration bands allow to \n\nidentify the presence of the crystalline ?-phase of PVDF (bands at 764, 796, 1149 and \n\n1383 cm\n-1\n\n) and the crystalline ? and/or ?-phases of PVDF (bands at 510, 512, 833, 838, \n\n840, 883 and 884 cm\n-1\n\n). In the last case, there is a superposition of some bands due to \n\nthe close chain conformation for both crystalline phases of the polymer and careful \n\nattention is required for the quantification of the phases [24]. In order to distinguish \n\n\n\nInfluence of zeolite structure and che mistry on the electrical and crystallization response  \n\n35 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\namong the electroactive ? and ? phases only not overlapping bands have to be used, \n\nsuch as the bands at 445, 467 and 1275 cm\n-1\n\n which are just characteristic of the ?-phase, \n\nand the ones at 431, 812 and 1234 cm\n-1\n\n which are characteristic bands of the ?-phase \n\n[24]. \n\nThe relative ? or ? phase content can be calculated applying equation 2.1, following the \n\nmethod described in [25-27] and assuming that the crystalline phase of the polymer is \n\neither in the ? or ? phase, with no or small traces of ? phase:  \n\n????\n\n?\n\n??\n\n?\n?\n\nAAKK\n\nA\n\nXX\n\nX\nF\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n)/(\n)(\n\n                                               \n\n(2.1) \n\nHere, A? and A? represent the absorbencies at 766 and 833 cm\n?1\n\n, which correspond to \n\nthe ?- and the ?-phase material; K? and K? are the absorption coefficients at the \n\nrespective wave numbers and X? and X? the degree of crystallinity of each phase. The \n\nvalue of K? is 0.365 and the value of K? is 0.150 \u00b5m\n-1 \n\n[24]. The polymer phase contents \n\nfor the different composites are shown in Table 2.2.  \n\nFigure 2.2 (a) and Table 2.2 show that the composites prepared with Y and A zeolites \n\ncrystallize completely in the electroactive ?-phase for this zeolite concentration: all the \n\nbands characteristic of the ?-phase, 764, 796, 1149 and 1383 cm\n-1\n\n, disappear and the \n\ncharacteristic bands of the ?-phase, 812 and 1234 cm\n-1\n\n, are present. On the other hand, \n\nthe nucleation efficiency of the electroactive phase of the ZSM-5 zeolite is strongly \n\nreduced with respect to the Y and A zeolites and  the L zeolite crystallizes in the non-\n\npolar ?-phase typical of PVDF when crystallized under similar conditions [25]. These \n\nresults show that the existence of aluminum atoms and, as a consequence, the existence \n\nof negative charges on the zeolite surface is important for the nucleation of the \n\nelectroactive phase. The presence of negative surface charges in the fillers has been \n\nproposed as the main mechanism responsible for the nucleation of the electroactive \n\nphase of the polymer [21, 28] and it is also confirmed for the zeolite structures. It is to \n\nnotice that the lower surface interaction between L zeolite and PVDF matrix due to its \n\none-dimensional structure prevents the nucleation on the ?-phase since polymer contact \n\nwith the charged surfaces within the zeolite only occur at the ends of the L zeolite \n\nparticles. The existence of O-H bonds at the acid sites allows partial crystallization of \n\nthe polymer in the ?-phase when the ZSM-5 zeolite is present, but the absence of cations \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n36 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\non its structure is responsible for the lower efficiency of this zeolite in  the \n\ncrystallization of the electroactive phase. \n\n700 800 900 1000 1100 1200 1300 1400 1500\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n?? ??

It is interesting in this context then to evaluate whether \n\nthere is also an influence in the degree of crystallinity, and this fact will further strongly \n\ninfluence the electromenchanical and electrical response of the materials. Figure 2.2 (b) \n\nshows the DSC scans for neat PVDF as well as for the PVDF/zeolite composites.  \n\nComparing with neat ?-PVDF, the A and Y zeolite composites show a shift on the \n\nmelting temperature to higher temperatures associated to the higher thermal stability  of \n\nthe ?-phase present on these composites [18]. On the other hand, the ZSM-5 and L \n\nzeolite composites show a wider melting peak with some lower temperature features \n\nwith respect to the main peak due to ill crystallized parts of the polymer related to the \n\npresence of the weaker interacting zeolites and to the presence of both phases in the \n\ncase of the ZSM-5 zeolite. In both cases the main melting peak corresponds to to ?-\n\nphase polymer. \n\n(a) (b) \n\n\n\nInfluence of zeolite structure and che mistry on the electrical and crystallization response  \n\n37 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\nThe quantification of the degree of crystallinity of the polymer was obtained from the \n\nDSC scans by applying equation 2.2: \n\n100\nH\n\nH\nm\n\nc\n?\n\n?\n???\n\n                                                              \n\n(2.2) \n\n \n\nHere,     represents the melting enthalpy of the composite and      , taken as 104,6 \n\nJ/g, is the melting enthalpy for a 100% crystalline sample of pure PVDF [3, 24]. \n\nIt is shown that the presence of zeolites does not change significantly the degree of \n\ncrystallinity of PVDF. The Y zeolite is the one that has a large effect on the reduction of \n\nthe degree of crystallinity of the polymer associated to the larger nucleation effect that \n\naffects crystallization kinetics in a way that results in a larger number of simultaneously \n\nsmaller spherulites which can lead to defective structures and lower crystallinity [16, \n\n17]. \n\n \n\nTabela 2.2? and ?-phase content and degree of crystallinity of ?-PVDF and PVDF/zeolite composites \n\nComposite ?-phase (%) ?-phase (%) Crystallinity (%) \n\n?-PVDF 100 % 0 % 47% \n\nPVDF/Y 5 % 95 % 37% \n\nPVDF/A 0 % 100 % 48% \n\nPVDF/L 100 % 0 % 43% \n\nPVDF/ZSM-5 58 % 42 % 49% \n \n\n \n\n2.3.3. Thermal stability and interfacial interactions \n\nThe influence of zeolites on the modification of the crystallization phase of the polymer \n\nindicates strong polymer-zeolite interactions. Further, the zeolite ability for molecule \n\nencapsulation in its chanels and cavities can also affect the composite electrical \n\nbehavior. In this way, thermogravimetric analyses are relevant to further study these \n\nissues. Figure 2.3 shows the weight loss of pristine ?-PVDF and the different \n\ncomposites measured at 10\u00baC/min. The weight loss of the composites films as a function \n\nof temperature can be divided into two main steps. The most significant loss occurs at \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n38 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\ntemperatures between 400 and 500 \u00baC and it is associated to the polymer degradation, a \n\nwell described process characterized by carbon-hydrogen bond scission [29]. The onset \n\ntemperature of this degradation process shows a slight increase in the composites, \n\nindicating that the presence of zeolites provides a stabilization of the polymer. \n\nThe mass loss at lower temperatures, between 0 and 400\u00baC (Figure 2.3, inset) is \n\ndetected only in the composites films, indicating a relationship with the presence of the \n\nzeolite fillers. This loss is related to the release of water and solvent molecules from the \n\nzeolite cavities [30] and shows larger values for the composites prepared with Y and A \n\nzeolite, followed by the ones prepared with L and ZSM-5. \n\nThe framework aluminum ratio is directly related to the adsorption capacity of water in \n\nthe zeolites cavities. The water vapor physically adsorbs on the tetrahedrally \n\ncoordinated aluminum and its associated cations as           bonds are nearly \n\nhomopolar and hydrophobic [31, 32]. The Y and A zeolites have a higher trend for \n\nmolecule encapsulation since they are the ones with the lower Si/Al ratio. On the \n\ncontrary, ZSM-5 zeolite, being composed exclusively by Si, shows the lowest capacity \n\nfor polar molecule encapsulation [32], including water and solvent molecules. \n\n0 200 400 600 800\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\nTemperature (\u00baC)\n\nW\ne\n\nig\nh\n\nt \n(%\n\n)\n\n ?-PVDF\n\n Y\n\n A\n\n L\n\n ZSM-5\n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 Thermogravimetric curves obtained for ?-PVDF and PVDF/zeolite composites.

Electrical Response \n\nIt has been demonstrated that the introduction of zeolites on polymers in general and in \n\nPVDF in particular influences the dielectric response of the composites [13, 14]. In this \n\nstudy, the composites were prepared with zeolites with varying pore size, shape and \n\nSi/Al ratio in order to assess their relative relevance in modifying the electrical response \n\nof the material. Figure 2.4 (a) shows the frequency dependent dielectric constant for the \n\nneat polymer and for the four composites. The frequency dependence is similar for the \n\ncomposites and for the pure polymer, with the dielectric constant decreasing with \n\nincreasing frequency [33], however, the values are higher for the composites, excepting \n\nfor the PVDF/ZSM-5 one which shows dielectric constant values similar to the polymer \n\nmatrix. This increase of the dielectric constant with the zeolite introduction is ascribed \n\nto two main factors. First, the existence of cations in the zeolite cavities leads to a \n\nconfined movement of charges into the zeolite cavities and to an interfacial polarization \n\neffects in the zeolite-polymer interface [34]. The cations, that compensate the charge of \n\nthe zeolite framework can become free to move through the zeolite cavities and \n\nchannels when the applied electric field is enough to overcome that electrostatic force. \n\nHowever, the movement of the cations is blocked by the polymer surrounding the \n\nzeolites, reducing the conductivity and creating an induced dipole moment, which in \n\nturn gives rise to higher dielectric constant [13]. Further, the water and solvent molecule \n\nencapsulation within the zeolite cavities also contributes to the dielectric response. \n\nThese polar molecules can rotate towards the dielectric field direction and contribute to \n\nthe increase of dielectric constant [30, 35] \n\nThis interpretation is supported by the dielectric behavior of the composite prepared \n\nwith the ZSM-5 zeolite (Figure 2.4) , which does not content aluminous atoms and \n\ntherefore has no charge compensation cations in the cavities. Furthermore, the structure \n\nof ZSM-5 is hydrophobic  and does not capture solvent and water molecules, when \n\ncompared with aluminium containing zeolites. This fact is further supported by the \n\nabove discussed TGA results (Figure 2.3). Due to these characteristics, the ZSM-5 \n\nzeolite does not contribute to the increase of composite dielectric constant, which \n\nconfirms the proposed mechanism for the increase of the dielectric response. \n\nOn the contrary, zeolite A is the one that shows the lowest Si/Al ratio and so (Table \n\n2.1), the largest amount of cations in its cavities. This zeolite is also, together with Y \n\nzeolite, able to capture a significant amount of water and solvent molecules (Figure 2.3). \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n40 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\nThe zeolites L and Y have a similar Si/Al ratio but different electrical response due to \n\nthe different cavity geometry. The results show that the one dimensional channel system \n\nof L zeolite promotes the increase of dielectric constant, probably due to a increased \n\ncooperativity and alignment of the induced dipoles along the structure. On the other \n\nhand, since this increase of the dielectric constant is due to interfacial polarization, the \n\nsmaller size of the L zeolite particle implies a larger contact area between zeolites and \n\npolymer that also contributes to a more significant effect of the dielectric constant. The \n\nrelevance of the surface area for the increase of the dielectric constant is further \n\nconfirmed by comparing the obtained dielectric results for the Y zeolite with the ones \n\nobtained in [12] with the same zeolite but with a smaller size. Specifically, dielectric \n\nconstant of 11 and 46 are obtained at 1 kHz for average zeolite sizes of 2,2 and 0,45 ?m \n\nrespectively for 16% wt composites \n\n1000 10000 100000 1000000\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n?\n'\n\n ?-PVDF\n\n Y\n\n A\n\n L\n\n ZSM-5\n\n \n\n1000 10000 100000 1000000\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n?\n''\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n PVDF\n\n Y\n\n A\n\n L\n\n ZSM-5\n\n \n\n1000 10000 100000 1000000 1E7\n\n1E-8\n\n1E-7\n\n1E-6\n\n1E-5\n\n1E-4\n\n??(rad/s)\n\n?\n (\n\ns\n/c\n\nm\n)\n\n PVDF\n\n Y\n\n A\n\n L\n\n ZSM-5\n\n \n\nFigure 2.4 Real (a) and imaginary parts (b) of the dielectric function and electrical conductivity (c) as a \n\nfunction of the frequency for neat PVDF and the different composites. \n\n \n\nComposites also show an increase of the imaginary part of the dielectric function due \n\nthe increase of ionic conductivity caused by the movement of charges within the zeolite \n\nstructure as well as from interfacial effects (Figure 2.4 b). This fact is better reflected in \n\nthe behavior of the a.c. conductivity, obtained from the dielectric measurements \n\napplying             and      \n   \n\n  \n (Figure 2.4 (c) ). The a.c. conductivity shows \n\nthe same frequency dependent as the polymer but the value is (less than one order of \n\nmagnitude) higher due to the larger number of ionic charge carriers provided by the \n\nzeolites. It is to notice at this point the the L zeolite shows K cations instead of Na as \n\nthe other zeolites, fact that does not seem to have such a large effect in the electrical \n\nresponse. The effect of cation type for a given zeolite structure on the electrical \n\nresponse of the composites should nevertheless be also systematically addressed. \n\n(a) (b) (c) \n\n\n\nInfluence of zeolite structure and che mistry on the electrical and crystallization response  \n\n41 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n2.4. Conclusion \n\nThis work discloses the influence of zeolites L, A, Y and ZSM-5 on the structural, \n\nthermal and electrical properties of PVDF. Zeolites Y and A shoe the ability to nucleate \n\nthe electroactive phase of the polymer due to stronger electrostatic interactions related \n\nto larger cation content. Further, the channel microstructure also plays an important role \n\nas the L zeolite is not able to nucleate the ?-phase of the polymer due to a reduced lower \n\ninteraction area with the polymer. The solvent and water encapsulation ability is directly \n\nrelated with the Si/Al ratio and so is the dielectric response of the material: lower Si/Al \n\nratios promote larger dielectric constants and encapsulation efficiencies. Again, this \n\nresponse can be additionally refined by the dimensionality of the pore system. Thus, \n\nzeolite L containing 1D channels shows superior performance than the 3D pore system \n\nof zeolite Y.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n42 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n2.5. References \n\n1.

Introduction \n\nPolymers are used in a wide variety of applications like structural parts, tissues, \n\npackaging, medical drugs, communications and many others [1, 2]. However, the need \n\nto improve their functional properties without substantial modifications of the \n\ncharacteristic polymer properties [3] lead to the incorporation of fillers within the \n\npolymer matrix, yielding polymer composites. Among functional polymers for \n\nadvanced applications, one of the most interesting ones is poly(vinylidene fluoride) \n\n(PVDF) due to properties like ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity [4, 5] \n\ntogether with flexibility, biocompatibility, a good thermal  and chemical resistance [6, \n\n7]. These properties make PVDF interesting for application in the areas of sensor and \n\nactuator. PVDF is a semi-crystalline polymer that can be in four crystalline phases: ?, ?, \n\n? and ?. Each one of them can be obtained by varying processing conditions [8, 9]. For \n\nsensor and actuator applications, ?-phase of PVDF is typically obtained by the \n\nstretching of ?-phase PVDF [10], which is the polymorph obtained in the conventional \n\nextrusion processes. The ?-phase provides the larger piezoelectric and dielectric \n\nresponse of the pure polymer [11]. PVDF has been widely used in the production of \n\ncomposites by the incorporation of different fillers. In particular, PVDF/ceramic \n\ncomposites have been used in order to improve dielectric and piezoelectric response of \n\nthe material [11, 12], PVDF/ferrites in order to achieve magnetic or magnetoelectric \n\nresponse [13, 14], PVDF/clay composites, in order to tailor phase content and improve \n\noptical transparency [15, 16], and PVDF/zeolite composites for modify the overall \n\nelectrical response [17], among others.  \n\nIn particular, zeolite composites show large potential to modify composite response due \n\nboth to their surface chemistry, large surface area and intrinsic porous microstructure \n\n[18] allowing to further encapsulate specific molecules within the zeolite cavities [19-\n\n21]. The zeolites are crystalline hydrated aluminosilicates of alkali metals and earth \n\nalkali metals like sodium, calcium, magnesium and potassium. with the empirical \n\nformula M2/nO.Al2O3.xSiO2yH2O [22], where M represents the compensating cation with \n\nvalence n, x is a number from 2 to 10 and y is a number from 2 to 7. They are formed \n\nby tetrahedron unit structures, with the [AlO4]\n-5\n\n tetrahedron presented in [SiO4]\n-4\n\n \n\nstructure carrying the negative charge excess. This negative charge should be \n\ncompensated by cations which exist within the cages and channels [23-25]. The cations, \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n48 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\ntogether with water molecules, form hydration spheres and compensate the structure. \n\nThe ionic exchange performed with cations allows to change the zeolite physical and \n\nchemistry properties such as thermal stability, adsorption capacity and amount and \n\nstrength of acidic sites, among others [26]. The zeolite Y belonging to the faujasite \n\n(FAU) family is the one selected for the present work due to previous results where \n\ndielectric response of the PVDF/zeolite composites was improved using ionic \n\nexchanged NaY zeolite [17]. This zeolite is formed by a three dimensional structure \n\nwith twelve silicon or aluminium atoms [27], yielding cavities that allows the \n\nincorporation of many different molecules. Some studies have been performed with \n\nzeolites within different polymer in order to improve their physical and chemical \n\nproperties [28]. Zeolites have been used to improve the conductivity of polyaniline \n\n(PANI) [28], for gas separation applications on polymer membranes [29, 30]], \n\nheterogeneous catalysis [31, 32], proton exchange membranes for fuel-cells [32, 33] and \n\nfor controlled drug release applications [33]. Zeolites are also being used to modify the \n\nphase and electrical response of PVDF [17, 34]. It was shown that the presence of \n\ncations in the zeolites cavities, induce an increase of the dielectric and conductivity \n\nresponse of the polymer due to restrict ionic motions and to an interfacial polarization \n\neffects [17], useful for a wide range of applications. In these studies it was also \n\nconfirmed the encapsulation of water and/or solvent molecules within the zeolite \n\ncavities, contributing to the overall increase in the dielectric response of the composites. \n\nThe PVDF composites were prepared by solvent casting, which implies contact of the \n\nzeolite with the polymer solution that can be encapsulated in the zeolite microporous \n\nstructure and therefore affect the electrical properties of the zeolites. Solvents like N,N-\n\ndimethylacetamide (DMA), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide \n\n(DMSO), hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), \n\ntetramethylurea (TMU), triethylphosphate (TEP), and trimethylphosphate (TMP) are \n\nconsidered good solvents for PVDF [8] allowing the solvent casting of PVDF. Among \n\nthese solvents, DMSO, DMF and TEP present distinct values of dielectric constant, \n\nproviding a good set of materials for the main objective and novelty of the present \n\ninvestigation: analyze the effect of the different solvent on the processing of PVDF and \n\nPVDF/zeolite composites and analyze qualitatively and quantitatively the encapsulation \n\nof the solvents within the zeolite structure and their contribution to the overall electrical \n\nresponse of the composites. \n\n\n\nInfluence of solvent properties on the electrical response of PV DF/NaY composites \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  49 \n\nPoly(vinylidene fluoride)/NaY composite films studied in this work are based in a \n\nmicroporous material. Porous materials are classified according to their porous size in \n\nmicroporous (? 2 nm), mesoporous (2 ? 50 nm) and macroporous (> 50 nm) materials \n\n[35]. Y zeolite is frequently chosen as a host to encapsulate compounds because of its \n\nlarge supercages (1.18 nm) with smaller pore opening (0.74 nm) suitable to \n\naccommodate the compounds [32]. All solvents used in this work have sizes smaller \n\nthan the channels of the zeolite and can be entrapped into the zeolite (Table 3.1). \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2. Experimental \n\n \n\n3.2.1. Materials \n\nPVDF in powder form and with a density of 1.78 g.cm\n-3\n\n (Solef 1010) was provided \n\nfrom Solvay (Belgium). The zeolite NaY (CBV100) in powder form was supplied by \n\nZeolyst International. All solvents, N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), \n\ndimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and triethyl phosphate (TEP) were purchased from \n\nAldrich (analytical grade) and previously dried using molecular sieve (Table 3.1).  \n\n \n\nTable 3.1 Characteristics of solvents \n\nAbbreviation \nMolecular \n\nstructure \n\nPurity \n\n(%) \n\nMolar \n\nweight \n\n(g.mol\n-1\n\n) \n\nDielectric \n\nconstant \n\nBoiling \n\npoint (\no\nC) \n\nDMSO \n \n\n99.5 78.12 46.40 189 \n\nDMF \n \n\n99.0 73.10 38.70 153 \n\nTEP \n \n\n99.8 182.16 13.01 215 \n\n \n\n \n\nS\nH3C CH3\n\nO\n\nH N\n\nO\n\nCH3\n\nCH3\n\nH3C O P O\nO\n\nCH3\nO\n\nCH3\n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n50 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n3.2.2. Preparation of ?-PVDF and ?-PVDF/NaY composite films \n\nThe ?-PVDF and ?-PVDF/NaY films were prepared by solvent casting [17]. For the \n\npreparation of the ?-PVDF films, 1.0 g of PVDF was mixed with 4 mL of solvent \n\n(DMF, TEP or DMSO) during 1 h at 100 rpm and spread into a glass. For the \n\nproduction of ?-PVDF/NaY composite films, 16 % weight of zeolite were added to 4 \n\nmL of solvent (DMF, TEP or DMSO) and placed in ultrasound bath during 6 h for \n\nhomogenization. After that, 1 g of PVDF was added and mixed during 1 h at 100 rpm \n\nbefore spreading it into a glass. After these steps, films were melted in an oven kept at a \n\ncontrolled temperature for 10 min. The oven temperatures were 210, 256 and 230 \u00baC for \n\nthe films prepared with DMF, TEP and DMSO, respectively. In this way, the difference \n\nbetween the boiling point of the solvent and the temperature at which the film is melted \n\nis maintained. These conditions guarantee the isothermal crystallization of PVDF. \n\nFinally, the films were removed from the oven and cooled down at room temperature. \n\nThe thickness of the films was around 40-50 \u00b5m. \n\n \n\n3.2.3. Characterization \n\nScanning electron micrographs (SEM) were collected with a LEICA Cambridge S360 \n\nScanning Microscope. Prior to the analysis, the samples were coated with gold using a \n\nFisons Instruments SC502 sputter coater. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy \n\n(FTIR) measurements were performed at room temperature using a Spectrum 100 \n\nPerkin-Elmer apparatus in ATR mode over a range of 650\u20134000 cm\n-1\n\n with a resolution \n\nof 4 cm\n-1\n\n. 32 scans were performed in each sample. Measurements of the ?\u2019, real part of \n\nthe dielectric function, and tan ?, dielectric loss, were performed at room temperature in \n\na home-built sample holder with an automatic Quadtech 1929 Precision LCR meter. \n\nThe signal of 0.5 V was applied for several frequencies in the range 100 Hz to 1 MHz. \n\nThe samples were coated by sputtering with circular Au electrodes of 5 mm diameter \n\nonto both sides of the sample. The characteristic volume I\u2013V curves were measured at \n\nroom temperature with a Keithley 6487 picoammeter/voltage source in a voltage range \n\nfrom -10 to 10 V. The thermal stability of the composite films as well as the pure \n\npolymer was studied with a Pyris1TGA from Perkin-Elmer. The atmosphere used was \n\nhigh purity nitrogen (99.99% minimum purity) with a flow rate of 20 mL.min\n-1\n\n. The \n\n\n\nInfluence of solvent properties on the electrical response of PV DF/NaY composites \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  51 \n\nsample holders were 70 ?L crucibles of alumina oxide, in which approximately 3 mg \n\nsample was placed. The samples were heated between 25 and 450 \u00baC at 10 \u00baC.min\n-1\n\n. \n\n \n\n3.3. Results and discussion \n\nAs observed in Figure 3.1, all samples show the typical spherulitic structure \n\ncharacteristic of neat ?-PVDF [35]. The effect of the solvent is the same for pristine \n\npolymer and composite samples: a reduction of the average size of the spherulites and a \n\nmore imperfect microstructure is observed for TEP and DMSO in comparison to DMF, \n\nthe most used solvent for PVDF. A further reduction of the spherulite size is observed \n\nfor each composite samples with respect to its pure polymer sample counterpart, due to \n\nthe influence of the zeolite in the crystallization process of the matrix [34, 36]. Further, \n\nno large agglomerated are observed in the composite samples, leading to the conclusion \n\nthat the zeolite are well dispersed within the polymer matrix in all samples. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) of pure polymer films prepared with DMF (a) TEP (b) \n\nDMSO (c) and PVDF/NaY composites films prepared with DMF (d) TEP (e) DMSO (f) all with 1000 x \n\nof magnification. \n\n \n\nThe neat PVDF films crystallize in the apolar ?-phase, as reported on the literature [10], \n\nand confirmed by FTIR (Figure 3.2). FTIR was also used to determine the crystalline \n\nphase of the polymer within the composite films, as electroactive phase nucleation has \n\nbeen observed in similar systems [16, 34]. The absorption bands obtained at 764 (CF2 \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n52 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\nand CCC), 796 (CH2), 855 (CH2), 976 (CH2) cm\n-1 \n\n(Figure 3.2) [8] are all characteristics \n\nbands of the PVDF ?-phase and no characteristic bands from ? or ? phases are observed \n\n[16]. The observation of the absorption band at 1020 cm\n-1\n\n within the composites \n\ncorrespond to the zeolite NaY band, (Si-O-Si) and confirms their presence in the \n\nstructure [37]. In this way, it was confirmed that the polymer crystallizes in ?-phase \n\nindependently of the solvent used in both neat polymer and composite films. \n\n700 800 900 1000 1100 1200 1300 1400 1500\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500 ?????

The variations of the \n\nreal part of the dielectric constant, ??, with frequency for the polymer and composites \n\nfilms are presented in Figure 3.3 (a). It is shown that preparation of neat polymer film \n\nwith different solvents does not influence the dielectric constant of the film indicating \n\nthat the solvents are effectively removed during the fusion stage in the preparation of \n\nthe polymer films. The composites films show, on the other hand, higher values of \n\ndielectric constant when compared with the pure polymer films [17, 38] but also quite \n\ndifferent when compared to the films prepared from the different solvents. The values of \n\nthe dielectric constant at a frequency of 1 kHz are presented in Figure 3.4. The observed \n\nincrease of the dielectric constant in the composites with respect to the pristine polymer \n\n\n\nInfluence of solvent properties on the electrical response of PV DF/NaY composites \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  53 \n\nsamples is due to the motion of ions inside the zeolite framework. The existence of \n\npolymer around it blocks the porous cavities and limits the ions mobility, which results \n\nin an increase of the dielectric constant. There are contributions to this increase by the \n\ninterfacial polarization between the zeolite structure and the polymer, (Maxwell-\n\nWagner-Sillars polarization [17, 38]. It is nevertheless observed (Figure 3.3 (a)) that the \n\nsolvent uses strongly influences the dielectric response of the composites films \n\n(especially at low frequencies). Composites with DMF and DMSO have the highest \n\ndielectric constant values, while the one with TEP shows the lowest values. Comparing \n\nthese values with the dielectric constant of the pure solvents it is verified that the \n\nsolvent with the larger dielectric constant (Table 3.1) lead to higher dielectric response \n\nof composites. \n\nThis effect can be explained by two different phenomena. The presence of organic \n\nmolecules inside the zeolite cages can drastically modify the distribution of intra zeolite \n\ncations [39], changing the activation energy and the Coulomb attraction between the \n\ncations and zeolite framework and, consequently, the confined mobility partly \n\nresponsible for the dielectric constant increase. On the other hand, the motion of polar \n\nmolecules on the presence of an electrical field leads, directly, to an increase of \n\ndielectric constant values [40]. \n\nThe dielectric loss, tan ?, as a function of frequency for all the prepared samples are \n\nrepresented in Figure 3.3 (b). Its value is calculated from tan ?=?\u2019\u2019/?\u2019, where ?\u2019 is the \n\nreal part of the dielectric permittivity ?\u2019\u2019is the frequency dependence of the imaginary \n\npart of the dielectric permittivity. Similarly to dielectric constant values, the films of \n\nneat polymer prepared with different solvents does not present significant variations. \n\nHowever, the presence of NaY zeolite on the polymer matrix increases, for all cases, the \n\ndielectric losses of the composites [17, 38]. This increase is particularly large for \n\ncomposites prepared with DMSO and DMF solvents, while TEP present the lower \n\nvalues of dielectric losses. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n54 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n \n\n100 1000 10000 100000 1000000\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n \n\n \n\nT\na\n\nn\n ?\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n PVDF_DMF\n\n PVDF_DMSO\n\n PVDF_TEP\n\n PVDF/NaY_DMF\n\n PVDF/NaY_DMF\n\n PVDF/NaY_DMF\n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 Frequency dependent real part of the dielectric constant (a) and dielectric loss (b) obtained for \n\nthe PVDF and PVDF/NaY samples obtained with the different solvents. \n\nDMF DMSO TEP  NaY DMF NaY DMSO NaY TEP\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n \n\n \n\nD\nie\n\nle\nc\ntr\n\nic\n c\n\no\nn\n\ns\nta\n\nn\nt\n\nSample Identification\n \n\nFigure 3.4 Real part of the dielectric constant obtained for the different solvents on polymeric and \n\ncomposite films, at 1 kHz frequency \n\n \n\nThe influence of the solvents on the dielectric losses indicates an increase of the zeolite \n\ncations mobility and, consequently, on the composites conductivity. For better \n\nunderstanding this influence, both a.c and d.c conductivities were studied.

Comparing the different samples, it can \n\nbe observed that the a.c. conductivity of the neat polymer (Figure 3.5 (b)) is very similar \n\nindependently of the solvent used. On the other hand, the solvent molecules presence \n\ncan change the a.c. conductivity of the composites by more than one order of \n\nmagnitude, especially at the lower frequencies. The composites prepared with DMSO \n\nshows highest a.c. conductivity, followed by DMF and TEP, what indicates that the \n\nsolvents with the higher dielectric constant (and lower molecular weight) contribute \n\nmore for ion transport. \n\n1000 10000 100000 1000000\n\n1E-9\n\n1E-8\n\n1E-7\n\n1E-6\n\n1E-5\n\n1E-4\n\nC\no\n\nn\nd\n\nu\nc\nti\nv\nit\ny\n (\n\ns\n/c\n\nm\n)\n\nFrequency (rad/s)\n\n PVDF_DMF\n\n PVDF_DMSO\n\n PVDF_TEP\n\n PVDF/NaY_DMF\n\n PVDF/NaY_DMSO\n\n PVDF/NaY_TEP\n\n \n\n-10 -5 0 5 10\n-8x10\n\n-8\n\n-6x10\n-8\n\n-4x10\n-8\n\n-2x10\n-8\n\n0\n\n2x10\n-8\n\n4x10\n-8\n\n6x10\n-8\n\n8x10\n-8\n\n~2 V ~4 V\n\nPVDF/NaY_DMSO\n\nPVDF/NaY_DMF\n\nVoltage (V)\n\nC\nu\n\nrr\ne\n\nn\nt \n\n(A\n)\n\n \n\nFigure 3.5 (a) a.c. conductivity calculated for the samples obtained from the different solvents (b) and I-\n\nV plot of composite films with 16% of NaY prepared with different solvents. \n\n \n\nMeasurements of d.c. conductivity were performed for PVDF/NaY composite films. \n\nThe introduction of NaY zeolite within the PVDF matrix induces two changes on the \n\nbehavior of the electrical conductivity [38]. First, there is an increase on the \n\nconductivity values of the composites when compared with the neat polymer. Further, \n\nthe conductivity behavior is divided into two regimes. The first regime is linear and the \n\nconductivity value is lower than the conductivity values of the second regime. The \n\nsecond one is also linear, but with higher values of conductivity. The intersection \n\nvoltage separating these two regimes of the I-V curves is called \u201cbreak voltage\u201d [42]. \n\nThis voltage is enough to reach the activation energy associated to the motion of the \n\ncations, i.e., is strong enough to break the interaction between ions and the zeolite \n\nframework and so they becomes free to move into zeolite cavities, increasing the \n\nconductivity of the composites. Since the \u201cbreaking voltage\u201d just depends on the nature \n\n-10 -5 0 5 10\n\n-4x10\n-10\n\n-2x10\n-10\n\n0\n\n2x10\n-10\n\n4x10\n-10\n\nPVDF/NaY_TEP\n\nVoltage (V)\nC\n\nu\nrr\n\ne\nn\n\nt \n(A\n\n)\n\n(a) (b) \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n56 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\nof the charge-balancing cations and the zeolite structure, the presence of different \n\namounts of NaY does not affect its value when samples with different zeolite \n\npercentage are prepared with the same solvent [38]. However, the presence of some \n\nmolecules as water or solvents can act as a support for cation mobility and so decreases \n\nthe potential barrier for ionic mobility [39]. This fact occurs due to a covalent \n\ninteraction of solvent molecules with the protons and sodium ions of zeolite [43]. In this \n\nway, the different molecular compositions of the encapsulated solvents originate \n\ndifferent effects on the conductivity of the sample, as confirmed by the results presented \n\nin Figure 3.5. This figure reveals the large influence of the molecules entrapped on the \n\nzeolite in the sample conductivity. TEP, the solvent with the lower dielectric constant, is \n\nthe one leading to composites with the smaller conductivity. Higher values are obtained \n\nfor DMF and DMSO samples. Besides this, the nature and strength of interaction \n\nbetween the cations and zeolite structure is affected, what gives rise to a change in the \n\n\u201cbreaking voltage\u201d value. The \u201cbreaking voltage\u201d for the samples prepared with DMF is \n\n~ 4V, while the \u201cbreaking voltage\u201d of the samples prepared with DMSO, solvent with \n\nthe higher polarity among the ones used, is ~ 2V. Apparently, the presence of polar \n\nmolecules decreases the activation energy of the conductivity process, and so, the \n\nvoltage needed for the beginning of the second conductivity regime is lower. The \n\ncomposite prepared with TEP, on the contrary to other two, does not present a double \n\nregime and the conductivity value is much lower when is compared to the other \n\ncomposites. This fact is ascribed to the higher value of \u201cbreaking voltage\u201d of this \n\ncomposite. Due to the lower dielectric constant of TEP, it does not support cation \n\nmobility and therefore a higher activation energy is needed for the initiation of the \n\nsecond conductivity process. Consequently, the \u201cbreaking voltage\u201d of this composite is \n\nhigher than 10 V and so only the first linear regime of conductivity is observed.  \n\nFinally, thermogravimetric analysis was performed on both neat polymer samples and \n\nthe corresponding composite films, in order to investigate the possible encapsulation of \n\nthe solvent within the zeolite structure that would explain the aforementioned effects. \n\nThermogravimetric measurements do not show any difference in the neat polymer \n\nsamples, just the results for neat PVDF prepared with DMSO solvent is represented \n\nsince the other two are overlapping. On the other hand, the composite films show \n\ndifferent thermal-response according to the solvents used. As shown in Figure 3.6, \n\ncomposites films have a common mass loss step between 50 and 100 \u00baC, that \n\n\n\nInfluence of solvent properties on the electrical response of PV DF/NaY composites \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  57 \n\ncorresponds to water loss present on zeolite cavities, and a second mass loss step at \n\nhigher temperatures, corresponding to solvent loss, which occurs at different \n\ntemperatures depending on the solvent used for the preparation of the composites. Since \n\nthe second step of mass loss can just be seen in the composites and not in the neat \n\npolymeric films and occurs at different temperatures on the different composites, the \n\nexperiment demonstrates that solvent was encapsulated in zeolite structure and explains \n\nthe observed differences in the overall electrical response of the composites. The \n\ncomposite with TEP solvent has the temperature of second step higher when is \n\ncompared to DMF and DMSO composites films. This behaviour is due to the different \n\nboiling points of solvents (Table 3.1) and also to the different interactions between the \n\nsolvents and the zeolite framework. \n\n0 100 200 300 400\n\n90\n\n95\n\n100\n\n PVDF/NaY_TEP\n\n PVDF/NaY_DMSO\n\n PVDF/NaY_DMF\n\n PVDF_DMSO\n\n \n\n \n\n%\n W\n\ne\nig\n\nh\nt \nlo\n\ns\ns\n\nTemperature (\u00baC)\n \n\nFigure 3.6 Thermogravimetric curves obtained for the samples prepared with the different solvents in \n\ncomposite films. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n58 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n3.4. Conclusion \n\nHighly flexible PVDF/NaY composite films were prepared by solvent casting with three \n\ndifferent solvents: DMF, DMSO and TEP. All the samples maintain the non-polar ?-\n\nphase and the typical spherulitic structure of PVDF and the presence of NaY cause a \n\ndecrease of the spherulitic size. The presence of NaY also induces an increase of the \n\ndielectric constant in all composites when compared with pure ?-PVDF due to confined \n\nmobility of sodium cations on zeolite structure. The dielectric constant of the solvent \n\nused also influences the dielectric and conductivity response of the composite films, \n\nsince its molecules are encapsulated into the zeolite cavities. Solvent molecules change \n\nthe distribution of intra zeolite cations and so the activation energy and the Coulomb \n\nattraction between cations and zeolite framework. On the other hand, the solvent polar \n\nmolecules are oriented on the presence of an electrical field. Due these facts, higher \n\ndielectric constant solvent leads to a higher dielectric constant response composite. The \n\ncomposite prepared with DMSO present the higher dielectric constant followed by \n\nDMF and TEP. Two regimes on I-V curve are observed for DMF and DMSO \n\ncomposites, however, the last one presents a lower \u201cbreaking voltage\u201d value. The \n\nsecond regime on TEP composites is not observed probably due the too higher \n\n\u201cbreaking voltage\u201d value observed. \n\n  \n\n\n\nInfluence of solvent properties on the electrical response of PV DF/NaY composites \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  59 \n\n3.5.

Introduction \n\nPoly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is a semi-crystalline polymer with the largest piezo \n\nand ferroelectric responses among polymers [1]. The piezoelectric ability of the material \n\nto convert mechanical into electrical energy and vice versa allows important \n\napplications in the areas of sensors and actuators [2]. The electroactive properties of the \n\nmaterial are intimately related to the presence of some of the crystalline phases of \n\nPVDF, in particular, the ?- and the ?-phases. The ?-phase can be obtain by mechanical \n\nstretching of the ?-phase (non-polar phase), by applying a strong poling electrical field \n\nor by crystallizing from solution with either dimethylformamide (DMF) or \n\ndimethylacetamide (DMA) at temperatures below 70 \u00baC [3, 4]. The later method results, \n\nnevertheless, in highly porous and fragile films [5]. On the other hand, the \n\ncrystallization or annealing at temperatures close to the melting temperature of PVDF \n\npromotes the development of the ?-phase [6]. \n\nTogether to these processing strategies, the nucleation of both electroactive phases, ? or \n\n?-phases, can be also achieved by micro and nanoparticle inclusions in the polymer \n\nmatrix [7-9]. This strategy shows several advantages with respect to the aforementioned \n\nones: a) new functionalities can be added to the polymer, such as magnetoelectric [10] \n\nand electro-optical responses [11], among others; b) it does not imply further processing \n\nsteps such as stretching or the application of high electric fields; c) it allows the \n\npreparation of thin and thick samples and samples with different shapes and formats by \n\ntechniques such as spin-coating [12], electrospinning [13], dip-coatig, etc and d) it \n\nfacilitates integration into micro and nanodevices [14]. \n\nNanoclays, layered alumina-silicates that consist on very thin layers usually bounded to \n\ntogether with counter-ions [15], are one of the most recent and interesting nanoparticles \n\nused for this purpose [9, 11, 16]. In this case, the nucleation of the electroactive phase of \n\nPVDF is also strongly affected by the processing conditions, such as the processing \n\ntemperature [11]. In this way, when the PVDF/clay composite is prepared from the melt \n\nat 200 \u00baC it crystallizes in the ?-phase, whereas the ?-phase is obtained when the \n\ncomposite is crystallized from temperatures below 200 \u00baC [11]. Considering that this \n\neffect is associated to surface interactions between the nanofillers and the polymer, it is \n\ninteresting to investigate whether the effect will occur in PVDF composites with \n\nparticles that share similar physical and chemical surface properties than the clays, such \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n66 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\nas zeolites. Further, whereas clays show a layered crystalline structure with a swelling \n\nand shrinking behaviour as water is absorbed or removed [17], zeolites show a rigid \n\nthree-dimensional framework of tetrahedral SiO4 and AlO4 primary building units, \n\nforming channels and cavities with sizes in the range of molecular dimensions [18]. \n\nThis intricate channel structure makes them an interesting material for shape selectivity \n\nand, differently from the clays, foreign molecules can move freely in and out the zeolite \n\npores without affecting the zeolite framework. Furthermore, zeolites can be used to \n\nproduce stable materials with respect to heat, steam and chemical attacks, making them \n\nsuitable for a wide range of applications [19]. \n\nIt has been proven that PVDF/Y zeolite composites prepared from the melt at 210 \u00baC \n\noriginate highly flexible films with increased dielectric response, being the PVDF/NaY \n\nthe one with the most interesting dielectric properties [20]. The dielectric constant of \n\nthese composites increases with respect to the pure polymer and depends on Si/Al ratio \n\nand zeolite content. An increase on the composite electrical conductivity is also \n\nobserved associated to an intrazeolite charge transport. However, the crystallization of \n\nPVDF polymer occurs on ?-phase [20, 21]. The present work shows the novel, \n\nimportant and interesting fact that the processing temperature influences the \n\ncrystallization phase of the polymer, leading to PVDF/NaY zeolite composites with the \n\npolymer in one of its electroactive phases. Further, the electroactive phase is obtained \n\nwithout the need of a stretching process, which allows easier processing of the material \n\nand fabrication of devices. In this way, the combination of the electroactivity of the \n\npolymer matrix and the cage structure of the zeolites results in composites with large \n\npotential for sensor and actuator [22] and energy harvesting and storage technologies \n\n[23], among others. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nElectrical and thermal behavior of ?-phase PVDF/NaY zeolite composites \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  67 \n\n4.2. Experimental \n\nComposite films of PVDF and NaY zeolite with zeolite concentrations of 4, 16, 24 and \n\n32 wt% and with a thickness of ~ 50 \u00b5m were prepared by spreading a solution of \n\nPVDF (Solef 1010 from Solvay, Belgium) in N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF, Merck) \n\nsolvent on a glass slide. Previously, the zeolite was dried at 120 \u00baC for 2 h added to 4 \n\nmL of DMF and placed in an ultrasound bath for 4 h. 1 g of PVDF in powder form was \n\nadded to this suspension and dissolved with the help of a magnetic stirrer (JPSelecta, \n\nAgimatic-E). After being melted at 190 \u00baC or at 210 \u00baC for 10 min, the film was \n\nremoved from the oven and cooled down at room temperature. \n\nThe NaY zeolites used for the preparation of the composites were obtained from Zeolyst \n\nInternational (Conshohocken, PA 19428-2240 USA) with the following characteristics \n\n(CBV 100): Si/Al ratio: 2.83; Nominal Cation Form: Sodium; Na2O weight: 13%; Unit \n\ncell size: 24.65 A; Surface Area: 900 m\n2\n/g. \n\nThe microstructure of the composite matrix and the dispersion of the NaY zeolite was \n\nanalysed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) surface images taken from the top \n\nside of the as prepared samples with a JEOL JSM-5410 scanning microscope. The \n\nsamples were previously coated with a thin gold layer using a sputter coater (Polaron, \n\nmodel SC502). \n\nThe phase of the polymer within the composite samples was analysed by Fourier \n\nTransformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) (Spectrum 100, Attenuate Total Reflectance \n\nmode) in the range between 650 and 4000 cm\n?1\n\n, on 32 scans. The error associated to the \n\nphase content evaluation is \u00b1 2%. \n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed in samples of ~6 mg on a \n\nMettler Toledo DSC 823 apparatus under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 \n\n? 0.2 \u00baC/min. The error associated to the evaluation of the transition temperature, \n\ncalculated after three replicas from different parts of the sample, is \u00b1 1%. \n\nThermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed in approx. 4\u00b1 0.01 mg samples \n\nwith a STD Q600 DETA instrument. The atmosphere used was high purity nitrogen \n\n(99.99% minimum purity) with a flow rate of 20 mL/min. During the experiments, the \n\nsamples were subjected to a heating rate of 10 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b0C/min between 25 and 800 \u00baC. \n\nThe samples of PVDF/NaY 4% and 32% were also subjected to different heating rates \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n68 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\nof 5 \u00b1 0.1, 10 \u00b1 0.2, 20 \u00b1 0.4 and 30 \u00b1 0.5\u00baC/min, between 25 and 800 \u00baC, in order to \n\nevaluate the degradation kinetics of the process. The large span of heating rated allow a \n\nproper determination of the activation energy of the process. The error associated to the \n\nevaluation of the TGA parameters, such as activation energy, calculated after three \n\nreplicas from different parts of the sample, is \u00b1 2%. \n\nThe dielectric constant was calculated from the values of capacity and tan ? obtained \n\nwith a an automatic Quadtech 1929 Precision LCR meter at room temperature in a \n\nhome-built sample holder. A signal of 1 V was applied for a range of frequencies \n\nbetween 100 Hz to 1 MHz. Circular Au electrodes of 2,5 \u00b1 0.1  mm radius were coated \n\nby magnetron sputtering on both sides of each sample. The associated error to the \n\ndetermination of the dielectric response calculated after three replicas from different \n\nparts of the sample is is 2%. \n\nCharacteristic I-V curves were measured at room temperature with a Keithley 6487 \n\npicoammeter/voltage source at a voltage range from -10 to 10 V.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3. Results and Discussion \n\nThe production of PVDF composites by solution casting and melting is a common \n\nprocedure, and the melting temperature is typically performed at 210\u00baC, temperature \n\nthat ensues the melting of polymer and the complete solvent removal [23]. Due to \n\nprevious investigation indicating the importance of the processing temperature in \n\nPVDF/clay composites [11], composites of PVDF with 4, 16, 24 and 32 wt% of NaY \n\nwere prepared by solvent casting and melting at 190 \u00baC (PVDF/NaY190\u00baC) and 210 \u00baC \n\n(PVDF/NaY210\u00baC) previous to crystallization at room temperature. \n\n \n\na) Microstructural features \n\nFigure 4.1 shows SEM images of the PVDF/NaY composites. The spherulitic structure \n\ncharacteristic of the neat ?-PVDF [24] is observed for the 4% and 16 wt% composite \n\nsamples. Further, a good dispersion of the zeolite filler is observed in the SEM images \n\n(Figure 4.1), which is corroborated by the electrical, thermal and FTIR measurements \n\nfrom different part of the samples. The decreasing size of the spherulites with increasing \n\n\n\nElectrical and thermal behavior of ?-phase PVDF/NaY zeolite composites \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  69 \n\nfiller content indicates that the filler act as nucleation agent during the crystallization \n\nprocess, as observed in other composites systems [10]. Increasing zeolite content in the \n\npolymer matrix above 16% leads to the formation of large zeolite agglomerates and a \n\ndisruption of the polymer microstructure. The effect of the crystallization temperature \n\ncan be observed by comparison of Figure 4.1 (b) and (d), corresponding to the 16 wt% \n\nsample crystallized after melting at 190 and 210 \u00baC, respectively. In both cases a good \n\ndispersion of the filler is observed, as well as the characteristic spherulitic \n\nmicrostructure. On the other hand, the samples melted at lower temperatures show \n\nsmaller spherulites, indicating the influence of melting temperature on the polymer \n\ncomposites crystallization. \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFigure 4.1 Surface SEM images of the PVDF/NaY composites with 4 (a), 16 (b) and 32 %wt (c) filler \n\ncontent after melting at 190\u00baC.

In order to understand this possible effect in the composites, the \n\ncrystalline phase of the polymer composites was investigated by FTIR-ATR. The ?-\n\nphase of PVDF is characterized by a wide range of bands [25], including the ones at \n\n764, 796, 1149 and 1383 cm\n-1\n\n. The identification of the crystalline phase has to be \n\nperformed carefully, as some bands are similar for different crystalline phases [26]. This \n\nis particularly important in the case of the electroactive ? and ? phases, where the bands \n\nat 510, 512, 833, 838, 840, 883 and 884 cm\n-1\n\n are superposition of ? and ? phases [27]. \n\nTherefore, these bands, often used for the identification of the phases, do not really \n\nallow to clearly identifying the specific electroactive phase of the polymer. Bands with \n\nno superposition from different phases are the ones at 445 and 467 cm\n-1\n\n, characteristics \n\nof the ? phase and the ones at 431, 812 and 1234 cm\n-1\n, characteristics from the ?-phase \n\n[27]. \n\nFigure 4.2 shows the FTIR-ATR spectra for the PVDF/NaY190\u00baC composites with 4, 16, \n\n24 and 32 wt% and for the PVDF/NaY210\u00baC composite 16%. According to FTIR bands in \n\nthe range from 700 to 1500 cm\n-1\n, the characteristic bands from ? and ?-phases are \n\nidentified [25,27-29]. The spectra of the PVDF/NaY190\u00baC and PVDF/NaY210\u00baC \n\ncomposites with 16%wt is particularly interesting: the spectra of the composite \n\nPVDF/NaY210\u00baC present the bands at 764 and 976 cm\n-1\n, identifying just the nonpolar ?-\n\nphase [25]; on the other hand, when the same composite is prepared by melting at the \n\ntemperatures of 190\u00baC, PVDF/NaY190\u00baC, the bands characteristics of from the ?-phase \n\ndisappear and the ones at 812, 833 and 838 cm\n-1 \nappear, identifying the ?-phase. \n\n \n\n\n\nElectrical and thermal behavior of ?-phase PVDF/NaY zeolite composites \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  71 \n\n800 1000 1200 1400\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n16%_210\u00baC\n\n32%_190\u00baC\n\n24%_190\u00baC\n\n16%_190\u00baC\n\n4%_190\u00baC\n\n?-PVDF\n\nT\nra\n\nn\ns\n\nm\nit\n\nta\nn\n\nc\ne\n\n (\nu\n\n.a\n.)\n\nWavenumber (cm\n-1\n\n)\n\n? ? ? ????\n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 FTIR-ATR spectra of PVDF/NaY composite with different NaY filler contents and obtain \n\nafter melting at different temperatures. \n\n \n\nAnalyzing the spectra for the PVDF/NaY190\u00baC composites with 4, 16, 24 and 32 wt% \n\n(Figure 4.2) a relationship between ?-phase and NaY content on the composite can be \n\nobtained. For the composite with NaY 4 wt%, the characteristic bands of the ?-phase, \n\n764 and 976 cm\n-1\n\n suffer a decrease with respect to the ones obtained for the pure \n\npolymer, but they only disappear for the composites with a higher NaY content, where \n\nthe polymer crystallizes practically in the ?-phase. The quantification of ?-phase content \n\nis performed by the application of the method presented in [3, 30]. Assuming that the \n\ncrystalline phase of the polymer is either in the ? and/or ? phases (i.e. no ?-phase is \n\npresent), the ? phase content will be given by equation 4.1: \n\n????\n\n?\n\n??\n\n?\n?\n\nAAKK\n\nA\n\nXX\n\nX\nF\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n)/(\n)(\n\n                                        \n\n(4.1) \n\nwhere, A? and A? representthe absorbencies at 766 and 833 cm\n?1\n\n, which correspond to \n\nthe ?- and the ?-phase material; K? and K? are the absorption coefficients at the \n\nrespective wave numbers and X? and X? represent the degree of crystallinity of each \n\nphase. The value of K? is 0.365 and the value of K? is 0.150 \u00b5m\n-1\n\n[3, 27]. \n\nThe ? phase content for each of the composites is summarized in Table 4.1. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n72 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\nTable 4.1 ?-phase content for the PVDF/NaY composites with different NaY content and crystallised \n\nafter melting at 190 \u00baC and recrystallised.

The main \n\nconclusion is the shift of the melting temperature to higher temperatures as corresponds \n\nto the higher thermal stability of the ?-phase in comparison to the ?-phase [4, 23]. \n\nAgain, it is interesting to notice the difference in the melting temperature of the \n\ncomposites with 16 wt% NaY crystallized after melting at the different temperatures: \n\nwhereas the melting behavior of the PVDF/NaY210\u00baC samples is the same as for the ?-\n\nphase sample, the PVDF/NaY190\u00baCshows the higher thermal stability of the electroactive \n\nphase. The degree of crystallinity of the polymer does not suffer significant variations \n\nwith increasing zeolite content, remaining in the order of ~48%. \n\n \n\n\n\nElectrical and thermal behavior of ?-phase PVDF/NaY zeolite composites \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  73 \n\n80 100 120 140 160 180\n\n1 mW\n\nTemperature (\u00baC)\n\nH\ne\n\na\nt \n\nF\nlo\n\nw\n E\n\nx\no\n\n D\no\n\nw\nn\n\n??PVDF\n\n16%_190\u00baC\n\n16%_210\u00baC\n\n32%_190\u00baC\n\n24%_190\u00baC\n\n4%_190\u00baC\n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 DSC thermograms under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10\u00baC/min for ?-PVDF and \n\nthe PVDF/NaY composites with different amounts of NaY zeolite. \n\n \n\nIn order to understand the zeolite-polymer interactions and whether the zeolite can \n\neffectively encaged molecules which could be affect the electrical response of the \n\ncomposites, dynamic thermogravimetric analyses were performed. Figure 4.4 shows the \n\nweight loss of?-PVDF and the composite films as a function of temperature, measured \n\nat 10\no\nC/min. The comparison of the TGA results was made with ?-phase from PVDF \n\ndue to the impossibility to obtain the total ?-phase crystallization for the neat polymer. \n\nFigure 4.4 shows that the thermal degradation in the composites occurs in several steps, \n\nbeing the one above 400 \u00baC the most relevant one and corresponds to the main \n\ndegradation of PVDF. One of the most distinct features is the loss of mass below 400 \u00baC \n\nthat is not present in the pure ?-PVDF and that increases as the zeolite content \n\nincreases. In the range of temperature at 50-400 \u00baC, the TGA curves show the existence \n\nof two stages of mass loss. The first stage takes place at 50-200 \u00baC and corresponds to a \n\nmass loss of about 10 % for the composite with the larger zeolite content and is related \n\nto water and solvent molecules entrapped in zeolite framework during the preparation of \n\ncomposites. The second stage at 200-400 \u00baC corresponds to a mass loss around   3 %. \n\nAs previously mentioned, the three-dimensional zeolite framework forms channels and \n\ncavities with sizes in the range of molecules, which can, be occupied by molecules [31-\n\n33] or affect thermal degradation of the polymer through catalytic effects [34, 35], \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n74 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\nleading to a shift of the main degradation process and therefore to the residues observed \n\nat a given temperature. However, PVDF polymer presents a high thermal stability [36]. \n\nThe main degradation process identified is associated to a carbon-hydrogen bond \n\nscission, that always primarily occurs due the lower bond strength energy of C-H \n\ncompared to C-F bond (410 and 460 KJ/mol, respectively) [37]. The onset temperature \n\nof this degradation process increases with increasing NaY content indicating that it \n\nprovides more stability to the polymer phase.  \n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nTemperature (\u00baC)\n\nW\ne\n\nig\nh\n\nt \n(%\n\n)\n\n ?-PVDF\n\n PVDF/NaY 4%\n\n PVDF/NaY 16%\n\n PVDF/NaY 24%\n\n PVDF/NaY 32%\n\n \n\n0 200 400 600 800\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n?-PVDF\n\n16% 210\u00baC\n\n16% 190\u00baC\n\n32% 190\u00baC\n32% 210\u00baC\n\nW\ne\n\nig\nh\n\nt \n(%\n\n)\n\nTemperature (\u00baC)\n \n\nFigure 4.4 Thermogravimetric curves obtained under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of  10 \u00baC/min \n\nfor the composites with different zeolite concentration (left) and for the composites prepared after melting \n\nat different temperatures (right). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4 (b) shows also a relationship between the mass loss of composite and the \n\ntemperature at which it was melted during its preparation. Two important facts are \n\nobserved: the mass loss at temperatures below 400 \u00baC is lower for the PVDF/NaY210\u00baC \n\ncomposites and the thermal stability they provide to the polymer seems to be higher. \n\nThese facts strongly indicate that the interactions between polymer and zeolite structure, \n\nleading to the crystallization in the electroactive phase, are changed due to the thermal \n\nhistory previous to crystallization. \n\n \n\n \n\n(b) (a) \n\n\n\nElectrical and thermal behavior of ?-phase PVDF/NaY zeolite composites \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  75 \n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n 5 \u00baC/min\n\n 10 \u00baC/min\n\n 20 \u00baC/min\n\n 30 \u00baC/min\n\nW\ne\n\nig\nh\n\nt \n(%\n\n)\n\nTemperature (%)\n\n \n\n1.28 1.32 1.36 1.40 1.44\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n50%\n\n45% 40% 30%\n20%\n\n10%l\no\n\ng\n(?\n\n) \n/ \n\n\u00baC\n.m\n\nin\n-1\n\n1000/T (K\n-1\n)\n\n \n\nFigure 4.5 TGA results obtained for the PVDF/NaY 4% at different heating rates (a) and plots of the \n\nlogarithm of the heating rate vs reciprocal temperature during the PVDF/NaY 4% degradation at various \n\nconversion levels (b). All linear fittings with R > 0.996. \n\n \n\nThe main thermal degradation process can be quantitatively characterized by the \n\nactivation energy (Eact) determined by the Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW) method [38, 39]. \n\nIn this case the kinetic parameters were obtained by applying multiple heating rates and, \n\nfrom the TGA degradation plots, the temperature is estimated for a specific conversion \n\nlevel. Figure 4.5 (a) represents the plot for various heating rates for the PVDF/NaY 4 \n\nwt% composite. As expected, Tonset is shifted to higher temperatures with increasing \n\nheating rate, shifting from 451 \u00baC to 513 \u00baC for a heating rate of 5\u00baC/min and 30\u00baC/min, \n\nrespectively. Figure 4.5 (b) shows the corresponding plot of the logarithms of the \n\nheating rates against the inverse of the absolute temperatures, which originates a straight \n\nline whose slop is proportional to the activation energy. Comparing the activation \n\nenergies of ?-PVDF with the ones obtained for the different composites (Figure 4.6), it \n\ncan be observed that the one with 4 wt% of NaY shows a similar kinetic parameter that \n\nneat ?-PVDF. On the other hand, the composite with the highest filler concentration, \n\nPVDF/NaY 32 wt%, the activation energy increases strongly. This indicates stronger \n\nchemical or physical bond between the filler and the matrix, since higher activation \n\nenergies are associated to reactions of the macromolecules with small molecules and/or \n\nradicals existing in polymers [40]. Probably, the microporous zeolite structure is \n\nblocked due to the cracking process and does not allow the polymer to diffuse more \n\nefficiently inside the zeolite. The initial polymer cracking probably occurs at the acid \n\nsites located on the external surface of the zeolite crystals or at the pore openings. This \n\n(b) (a) \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n76 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\ncracking produces smaller molecules, which are able to diffuse inside the zeolite and \n\ntransformed in coke due to the presence of Br\u00f8nsted acid sites, leading to obstruction of \n\nthe microporous structure [41, 42]. \n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\nConversion Rate\n\nE\n a\n\n (\nK\n\nJ\nm\n\no\nl-\n\n1\n)\n\n alfa-PVDF\n\n PVDF/NaY 4%\n\n PVDF/NaY 32%\n\n \n\nFigure 4.6 Plots of the activation energy of the degradation processes as a function of zeolite \n\nconcentration \n\n \n\nd) Electrical response \n\nThe existence of cations as well as polar molecules into the zeolite cages can affect the \n\nelectrical behavior of composites.

This effect is associated to restricted ionic motions and to \n\ninterfacial polarization effects in the zeolite cavity and in the zeolite- polymer interface \n\n[43], caused by a confined mobility of the cations presented in the zeolite structure. \n\n \n\n\n\nElectrical and thermal behavior of ?-phase PVDF/NaY zeolite composites \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  77 \n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n4\n\n10\n5\n\n10\n6\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n190\u00baC\n\n32%\n\n24%\n\n16%\n\n4%\n\n?-PVDF\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n?\n'\n\n \n\n-5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n\n0\n\n300\n\n600\n\n900\n\n1200\n\n1500\n\n32%\n\n24%\n16%4%\n\nNaY (%)\n\n?\n'\n\n \n\nFigure 4.7 Real part of the dielectric constant, ?\u2019, (a) as a function of the frequency for all samples under \n\nstudy (a) and variation of ?\u2019 as a function of all samples at room temperature at 1kHz. \n\n \n\nUnder an electric field, the cations can overcome the negative electrostatic attraction \n\nand become free to move along the channels of the zeolite structure. However, and \n\ncontrary to what happen on pure zeolite, since the zeolite nanoparticles in composite are \n\nsurrounded by a polymer matrix, the ionic mobility of the ions is blocked which reduces \n\nthe effect of conductivity and allows the creation of an induced dipole moment which \n\nresults in high values of dielectric constant [20]. Despite the interfacial polarization be \n\nthe main responsible factor for the increase of dielectric response, some others factors \n\nwill contribute to the variations of the dielectric response, as the presence of water \n\nmolecules and/or solvent or the crystalline phase of the polymer. In this way, the \n\nmobility of polar molecules such as water or DMF inside the zeolite cavities can also \n\nfurther contribute to the increase of ?\u2019 values. In this way, samples prepared at 190 \u00baC \n\nshowing larger water or solvent losses show higher values of the dielectric constant and \n\nthe dielectric losses, due to the nature of the contribution to the dielectric response, \n\nbeing accompanied by high dielectric losses as presented in Figure 4.8. \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n78 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n4\n\n10\n5\n\n10\n6\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n?\n'\n\n210\u00baC\n\n190\u00baC\n\n16%\n\n \n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n4\n\n10\n5\n\n10\n6\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000\n32%\n\n210\u00baC\n\n190\u00baC\n\n?\n'\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n \n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n4\n\n10\n5\n\n10\n6\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n16%\n\n210 \u00baC\n\n190 \u00baC\n\nT\ng\n\n ?\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n \n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n4\n\n10\n5\n\n10\n6\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n32%\n\nT\ng\n\n ?\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n210 \u00baC\n\n190 \u00baC\n\n \n\nFigure 4.8 Real part of the dielectric constant (a) (b) and dielectric loss (c) (d) as a function of the \n\nfrequency for the composites \n\n \n\nThe variation of the dielectric response on the samples obtained after the different \n\ncrystallization temperatures can be observed by comparing the dielectric response of the \n\ncomposites with 16 wt% and 32 wt% of NaY melted at 210 \u00baC and 190 \u00baC. Figure 4.8 \n\nshows the comparison between the variation on the real part of the dielectric constant \n\n(a) (b) and dielectric loss (c) (d) as a function of the frequency for both composites. It is \n\nobserved that the melting of the material at different temperatures influences its \n\ndielectric behavior. The PVDF/NaY190\u00baC compositespresent higher values of ?\u2019 when \n\ncompared with the PVDF/NaY210\u00baC composites. This fact can be explained by the \n\ndifferent crystallization phase presented by these materials. Polymer chain of PVDF on \n\nthe ?-phase presents a lower dipole moment when compared with the ?-phase, which \n\ntranslates in higher interactions with the zeolite structure and with the surrounding \n\nmolecules. On the other hand, these results can also be associated to a more effective \n\n(a) (b) \n\n(d) (c) \n\n\n\nElectrical and thermal behavior of ?-phase PVDF/NaY zeolite composites \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  79 \n\nencapsulation of water molecules in the zeolite supercages when the sample is melted at \n\nlower temperatures, as confirmed by TGA (Figure 4.4).  \n\nHigh values of dielectric losses indicate presence of ionic conductivity. In this way, it is \n\nimportant the study the d.c. and a.c conductivity in order to further understand this \n\nphenomenon. \n\nThe a.c. conductivity was obtained from the dielectric measurements applying      \n\n       and is represented in Figure 4.9 (c). An increase of 7 orders of magnitude is \n\nobserved on the low frequency side of the a.c. conductivity by increasing zeolite \n\ncontent. A linear frequency dependence can be observed in Figure 4.9 (c). The increase \n\nof conductivity with frequency is associated to the higher mobility of the ions present in \n\nthe zeolites and is to be understood in the scope of the Dyre model [44]. In the same \n\nway, the increase of zeolite content is associated to an increase of ions content, which \n\nexplains the higher conductivity. \n\n \n\n-10 -5 0 5 10\n\n-8.0x10\n-7\n\n-4.0x10\n-7\n\n0.0\n\n4.0x10\n-7\n\n8.0x10\n-7\n\n190\u00baC\n\nC\nu\n\nrr\ne\n\nn\nt \n\n(A\n)\n\nVoltage (V)\n\n \n\n-10 -5 0 5 10\n\n-6.0x10\n-8\n\n-4.0x10\n-8\n\n-2.0x10\n-8\n\n0.0\n\n2.0x10\n-8\n\n4.0x10\n-8\n\n6.0x10\n-8\n\n210\u00baC\n\nC\nu\n\nrr\ne\n\nn\nt \n\n(A\n)\n\nVoltage (V)\n\n \n\n2 3 4 5 6 7\n-9\n\n-8\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n??PVDF\n\n32%\n\n24%\n\n16%\n\n4%\n\nlog (?(rad/s))\n\nlo\ng\n\n (\n?\n\n (\ns\n\n/c\nm\n\n))\n\n \n\nFigure 4.9 I-V plot of ?- PVDF/NaY composites with 16% of NaY melted at 190\u00baC (a) and 210\u00baC (b); \n\nlog-log plot of the conductivity as a function of frequency for the composites of PVDF with different \n\nzeolite content, melted at 190\u00baC (c) \n\n \n\nThe d.c. conductivity was studied after the characteristic I-V curves (Figure 4.9 (a) and \n\n(b)). When compared to pure PVDF, the composites show higher conductivity and a \n\nnon-linear characteristics. The conductivity behavior of the composite can be divided in \n\ntwo different regimes. The first one goes up to a voltage value around 4 V, it is linear \n\nand similar to the one obtained for pure ?-PVDF. However, for higher voltages, a \n\nstronger increase of the conductivity is observed. This voltage value is known as \n\n\u201cbreaking voltage\u201d and is defined as the voltage of the intersection of the two regimes \n\n(a) (b) (c) \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n80 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\nof the I-V curves [45]. This value is the same for all the composites prepared at different \n\npercentages, although the conductivity of the composites is being higher for higher NaY \n\nzeolite contents. This fact is explained by a mechanism of intrazeolite charge transport: \n\nthe applied voltage after the \u201cbreaking voltage\u201d is strong enough to break the interaction \n\nbetween ions and the zeolite framework, that gain mobility and facilitates the \n\nintracrystalline charge migration. So, the needed voltage to release the ions depends \n\nonly on the nature of the charge-balancing cations and the zeolite structure, which \n\nexplains the similar value of \u201cbreaking voltage\u201d for all the composites. However, after \n\nthis point, the electrical conductivity of composites is significantly affected by zeolite \n\npercentage, since a higher percentage means a larger number of cations, what is \n\ntranslated in higher ionic conductivity, further, increasing filler concentration also leads \n\nto zeolite agglomerates leading to intra zeolite charge transport and increasing \n\nconductivity. This effect is particularly relevant for concentrations above 16%. Taking \n\ninto account the slope of the I-V plot for the higher conductivity regime of the different \n\nsamples, it is concluded that the electrical conductivity increases up to 7 orders of \n\nmagnitude by increasing zeolite content (Figure 4.9 (a) and (b)). Since the water is a \n\nmedium for ion transport, its content into zeolite cavities also affects the conductivity of \n\ncomposite. Water content and electrical conductivity are higher therefore by increasing \n\nzeolite content. The comparison of I-V curves of PVDF/NaY190\u00baC and PVDF/NaY210\u00baC \n\ncomposites with 16% NaY identify this fact (Figure 4.9). It is shown that the melting \n\ntemperature does not affect the form of the I-V curve. The composite PVDF/NaY190\u00baC, \n\nsimilarly to PVDF/NaY210\u00baC, increases its conductivity when compared with the pure ?-\n\nPVDF, and also the linear regime is replaced by a double regime behavior. However, \n\nthe conductivity values are quite different. It can be observed that the conductivity of \n\nPVDF/NaY190\u00baC is one order of magnitude higher than the one of PVDF/NaY210\u00baC, the \n\nbreaking voltage still being the same in both cases (~ 4 V), as it just depends on the \n\nnature of the charge-balancing cation and the zeolite structure [45]. Finally, it is \n\nimportant to notice the large different in the electrical properties of the PVDF-zeolite \n\ncomposites as compared to the PVDF-clay counterparts [26], despite both fillers being \n\nable to nucleate the electroactive phase of PVDF, being both the dielectric constant and \n\nelectrical conductivity much larger for the zeolite composites due to both water and ion \n\ncontent. \n\n\n\nElectrical and thermal behavior of ?-phase PVDF/NaY zeolite composites \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  81 \n\n4.4. Conclusion \n\nComposite films of PVDF with NaY zeolite were successfully prepared by solvent \n\ncasting, melting and recrystallization. It was demonstrated that the melting temperature \n\ncan affect the PVDF crystallization phase. In this way, the composites prepared after \n\nmelting at 190\u00baC crystallize in the ?-phase, while the ones prepared after melting at \n\n210\u00baC crystallize in the ?-phase. The composites show a higher thermal stability and the \n\npresence of water molecules encapsulated in the zeolite structure. Both effects are \n\ndependent on zeolite content and composite preparation temperature. The presence of \n\nions to stabilize the zeolites structure causes an increase of dielectric response of the \n\ncomposite due to the confined mobility into the zeolites cavities and to interfacial \n\neffects. The presence of these ions in zeolites is also responsible for the existence of \n\nnon-linear I-V curves with two regimes separated by the break voltage in which a strong \n\nincrease of conductivity takes place due to the resale of the ion-zeolite interaction. The \n\npresence of trapped water molecules as well as the electroactive phase of the polymer \n\ncontribute to the increase of the values of both the dielectric constant and the \n\nconductivity. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n\n82 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n4.5.

Introduction \n\nElectroactive poly(vinylidene fluoride)/zeolite composites are interesting materials for \n\nadvanced applications due to the electroactive properties of the polymer matrix [1, 2] \n\nand the characteristics of the nanoporous zeolite structures which allow tailoring optical, \n\nmagnetic and electric properties by suitable synthesis strategies and the possibility to \n\nhost specific guest molecules within the framework [3-6]. Poly(vinylidene fluoride), \n\nPVDF, shows excellent mechanical properties, high thermal and chemical stability and \n\nthe strongest piezo-, pyro and ferroelectric responses among polymers [2], allowing a \n\nvariety of technological applications such as sensors and actuators. This semi-crystalline \n\npolymer is also known for its polymorphism. It can be  obtained in polar (?, ? and ?) \n\nand non-polar (?) phases by the variation of crystallization conditions [7], which \n\ninclude control of crystallization temperature [8],  mechanical stretching [9] or the \n\nintroduction of specific fillers [10-12]. \n\nThe dielectric response of PVDF is one of the key parameters for applications. Neat \n\nPVDF shows a dielectric constant between 6 and 12 at room temperature, depending of \n\nthe polymorph, and two main relaxation processes. The first relaxation process is \n\nknown as the ?-relaxation. It occurs at low temperatures and it is associated to \n\ncooperative segmental motions within the main chains of the amorphous regions during \n\nthe glass transition of the polymer. The second relaxation, known as the ?-relaxation, \n\nappears at higher temperatures and it is associated to molecular motions within the \n\ncrystalline fraction of the polymer [13-16] or in the crystal-amorphous interphase \n\nregion, [17]. It has been shown that poling the electroactive phase of PVDF, an \n\nimportant step for using the material for sensor applications, does not affect the \n\nrelaxation temperatures of PVDF, the ?-relaxation appearing around -35 \u00baC and the ?-\n\nrelaxation above 40\u00baC, at 1Hz [18]. \n\nZeolites are microporous crystalline aluminosilicates formed by the coordination of \n\n? ? ?4\n4\n\nSiO  and ? ? ?5\n4\n\nAlO  with oxygen atoms bonding neighboring tetrahedral [19]. Their \n\nuniform and molecular-sized pores makes them interesting for catalysis [20], adsorption \n\n[21] and ion exchange [22] applications. Together with these applications with the \n\nzeolites in powder form, these materials have been used separation membranes and \n\nmembrane reactors in the form of films [23]. The dielectric properties of zeolites are \n\ninfluenced by several factors, such as the nature of the cations, their size and charge, the \n\nlattice structure and the degree of hydration [24].  \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n90 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\nOne of the most interesting and used zeolite structures is the NaY-zeolite. It shows \n\ninteresting electrical properties ascribed to two main processes: a low-temperature \n\nprocess associated to local motions (dielectric relaxation) and a high-temperature \n\nprocess associated to translational motions (diffusion/conductivity) [25]. At low \n\nfrequency, the dielectric relaxation process is assigned to a Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars \n\nprocess that is shifted to higher frequency as temperature increases. The latter relaxation \n\nat the highest frequencies, is ascribed to the local motions of cations in the ?-cage \n\nand/or rotational fluctuations of water molecules [26, 27]. However, the large mobility \n\nof the exchangeable cations (local polarization in the supercages and long-range \n\nmigration over larger distances) results in a high electrical ionic conductivity [25, 26]. \n\nThe influence of zeolite content in the dielectric relaxation and electrical conductivity of \n\nzeolite-polymer composites has been scarcely reported. In particular, it has been shown \n\nthat ionic relaxation dominates the ac conductivity behavior of zeolite \u2013 conductive \n\npolymer composites [28, 29]. \n\nPrevious studies on PVDF-zeolites composites demonstrate that the presence of NaY \n\nzeolite in the PVDF matrix induces an increase of the room temperature dielectric \n\nresponse of the polymer associated to confined ion mobility in the zeolite cavities and to \n\na Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars polarization [30]. Further, the presence of NaY zeolite can \n\nalso induce the ?-phase crystallization of the polymer, leading to piezoelectric \n\ncomposites [31]. In this way, PVDF/zeolite composites appear as a very promising set \n\nof materials with a wide range of potential applications. The electrical behavior of these \n\nmaterials is critical for the development of applications and therefore deserved a deep \n\ninvestigation in order to to assess the effect of nanoparticle contents and polymer-zeolite \n\ninteractions on the ion and dipole mobility.  \n\nIn the present work, PVDF/ NaY zeolite composite films with different NaY zeolite \n\ncontents were prepared by solvent casting. The microstructure and crystalline phase \n\nwere evaluated by scanning electron microscopy  and Fourier transform infrared \n\nspectroscopy, respectively. The dielectric relaxation spectrum and electrical \n\nconductivity behavior were evaluated and the the electric modulus formalism was \n\napplied at high temperatures in order get insight on the origin of the electrical response \n\nof the composite.  \n\n \n\n\n\nDielectric relaxation, ac conductivity and electric modulus in PVDF/NaY  \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  91 \n\n5.2. Experimental \n\n \n\n5.2.1. Sample preparation \n\nComposite films of PVDF (Solef 1010) with different NaY zeolite contents were \n\nprepared by solvent casting [30]. The zeolite was obtained from Zeolyst International \n\n(Conshohocken, PA 19428-2240 USA) in powder form with the following \n\ncharacteristics (CBV 100): Si/Al ratio = 2.83 with 7.76 % of sodium content (which \n\ncorresponds to 47.2 sodium for unit cell) and a specific surface area of 787 m\n2\n/g.  \n\n The zeolite was dried at 120 \u00baC for 2h and added to N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) \n\nsolvent. The suspension was then placed in an ultrasound bath for 4 h for \n\nhomogenization. After this period, 1 g of PVDF polymer was added to the zeolite \n\nsuspension and dissolved under magnetic stirring. Finally, the material was spread on a \n\nglass slide and the solvent was evaporated in an oven at 190\u00baC for 10 min (at this \n\ntemperature the polymer is in the liquid state). In this way, homogeneous composite \n\nfilms with a thickness of ~ 50 \u00b5m were prepared with different zeolite contents (wt/wt \n\n%): 0 (PVDF), 4 (PVDF/NaY4% ) and 16 % (PVDF/NaY16%). \n\n \n\n5.2.2. Characterization \n\nSamples were coated with gold using a sputter coating and their morphology was \n\nobserved by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (model JSM-6300, JEOL) with an \n\naccelerating voltage of 10 kV.  \n\nInfrared measurements (FTIR) were performed at room temperature in a Perkin-Elmer \n\nSpectrum 100 apparatus in ATR mode from 4000 to 650 cm\n-1\n\n. FTIR spectra were \n\ncollected with 32 scans and a resolution of 4 cm\n-1\n\n.  \n\nDielectric measurements were carried out using an impedance analyzer Alpha-S. The \n\ntemperature control was assured by a Quatro Cryosystem from Novocontrol GmbH. \n\nCircular gold electrodes (10 mm diameter) were deposited onto both sides of each \n\nsample, to form a parallel plate capacitor, by sputtering with a Polaron Coater SC502 \n\nunder an Argon atmosphere. The sample cell with active head dielectric converter was \n\nmounted on a cryostat (BDS 1100) and exposed to a heated gas stream evaporated from \n\na liquid nitrogen Deward.

However, this process only occurs when the sample is melted at temperatures \n\nbelow 200 \u00baC, the melting at temperatures above 200 \u00baC inducing the crystallization of \n\nthe polymer in the apolar ?-phase [31].

Nevertheless, the simultaneous increase of ?\u2019 indicates that \n\na significant contribution of the Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars (MWS) effect must be \n\nconsidered in this region. This contribution is related to the accumulation of electric \n\ncharges in the discontinuity surfaces between amorphous and crystalline phases \n\nproducing macroscopic dipoles. The relaxation associated to the molecular motions \n\nwithin the crystalline region (that can be detected in dynamic-mechanical experiments \n\n[16]) of the material should appear at  temperatures above 60\u00baC, however it cannot be \n\nseen in the dielectric measurements due to the overlap of the conductivity and \n\ninterfacial polarization phenomena at these temperatures [34, 35]. In the composites \n\n(Figures 5.3 (b) and (c)), the presence of the zeolite particles add a low-temperature \n\nrelaxation process, appearing between -100 and -50 \u00baC,  that can be observed in the \n\namplification shown in Figure 5.3 (d). We will call it hereafter ? relaxation. The origin \n\nof the dielectric relaxation process of zeolites has been ascribed to the distribution of \n\nextra-framework cations and their migration among various available sites of the \n\nzeolites [24]. In addition, it should be also contributions of water molecules inherent to \n\nthe zeolite filler (for 16% wt of zeolite, the water percentage in the composite is 7%) \n\n[30, 38]). In this way, considering the relaxation processes of zeolites reported in a \n\nprevious study [27], the relaxation peak represented in Figure 5.3 (b), (c) and (d) is \n\nassigned to the rotation of water molecules with eventual contributions in the case of the \n\ncomposite of encapsulated polar solvent in the sodalite cages and to the movements of \n\nthe Na\n+\n ions in the supercages. \n\n \n\nFinally, the high temperature side of the dielectric spectrum of the composites is largely \n\nmodified with respect to pure PVDF. The presence of charged particles introduces new \n\ndiscontinuity surfaces and thus new contributions to interfacial polarization. The \n\ndetailed analysis of the relaxations will be separated in two sections, one dedicated to \n\nthe low-temperature processes, mainly of dipolar origin, and the other one to the high \n\ntemperature MWS processes.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n96 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n5.3.3. Low temperature relaxation processes \n\nA more evident representation of this relaxation zone can be observed in Figure 5.4 in \n\nwhich the temperature scale has been expanded in the low-temperature region, showing \n\nthe overlapping of the main relaxation of PVDF and the zeolite ?-relaxation. Figure 5.4 \n\n(a) and (b), in addition to show more clearly the ?-relaxation from -65 to 10 \u00baC, also \n\nallows to detect a small relaxation between -85 and -45\u00baC [39, 40] that is assigned to a \n\nlocal mobility of the amorphous phase of the polymer, identified as the ?-relaxation \n\n[16]. In Figures 5.4 (c) and 5.4 (d) it is confirmed the presence of the zeolite relaxation. \n\nAt 100 Hz, for a temperature of -80\u00baC, the aforementioned ? relaxation associated to the \n\nrotational fluctuations of water molecules and movements of the NaY\n+\n in the sodalite \n\ncages is observed and a shift of the relaxation to higher frequencies occurs as the \n\ntemperature increases. The increase of temperature also allows the visualization (Figure \n\n5.4 (c)) of another relaxation for low frequencies, which is related to a Maxwel-\n\nWagner-Sillars polarization on the polymer and zeolite interface. The introduction of \n\nhigher zeolite contents (Figure 5.4 (d)) leads to a masking of this relaxation and the ?-\n\nrelaxation of PVDF due to conductivity effects. \n\n10\n0\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n4\n\n10\n5\n\n10\n6\n\n10\n7\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n 0\n\n 20\u00baC\n\n 40\u00baC\n\n 60\u00baC\n\n 80\u00baC\n\n %(12)\n\n -120\u00baC\n\n -100\u00baC\n\n -80\u00baC\n\n -60\u00baC\n\n -40\u00baC\n\n -20\u00baC\n\n?/ Hz\n\n \n\n \n\n?\n''\n\n \n\n10\n0\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n4\n\n10\n5\n\n10\n6\n\n10\n7\n\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n \n\n \n\n?\n''\n\n ? / Hz  \n\n10\n-1\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n4\n\n10\n5\n\n10\n6\n\n10\n7\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n?/ Hz\n\n?\n''\n\n \n10\n\n-1\n10\n\n0\n10\n\n1\n10\n\n2\n10\n\n3\n10\n\n4\n10\n\n5\n10\n\n6\n10\n\n7\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n \n\n \n\n?\n''\n\n? / Hz  \n\nFigure 5.4 (a) Frequency dependence of ?\u2019\u2019 showing relaxation processes of PVDF.

The appearance of the ? relaxation of the NaY \n\nzeolite is observed in the composites. At low frequency, the increase of space charge \n\nphenomena prevents the visualization of the ?-relaxation characteristic of the polymer \n\nwhen the zeolite content increases. The increase of frequency reduces this contribution \n\nand therefore it is possible the visualization of the ?-relaxation even for higher NaY \n\nzeolite contents. At first sight it seems that the presence of the zeolite particles nearly \n\nhas no effect on the ?-relaxation of PVDF (Figure 5.5). To further characterize this \n\nissue, the relaxation dynamics was analyzed in the scope of the Vogel-Fulcher-\n\nTammann (VTF) formalism [41]: \n\n? ? ? ?0\n0\n\nTTk\n\nE\n\nB\n\nVFTH\n\neT\n?\n\n???\n                                                     \n\n(5.1) \n\n \n\nwhere ? is the relaxation time, VFTHE  is the VFT energy, Bk  is the Boltzmann constant \n\nand 0T  is the critical temperature at which molecular motions become infinitely slow \n\n[13-15].

High temperature relaxation processes \n\nTogether with the relaxations of dipolar origin that occurs at temperatures in the range \n\nand below the glass transition of the polymer matrix, the mobility of the space charges \n\nat higher temperatures contribute to the dielectric relaxation spectrum of the composite. \n\nPrevious studies show that both PVDF and zeolites show ionic conduction and MWS \n\nprocesses and new effects arise in the composite due to the formation of new interfaces \n\nbetween polymer matrix and the zeolite. The analysis of these processes is favored by \n\npresenting the relaxation spectrum in the ac conductivity or dielectric modulus \n\nformalisms.  The conductivity can be calculated from the permittivity through:  \n\n \n\n? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ? ? ? ???????????????????? '\n0\n\n''\n\n0\n\n'''\n\n0\n\n*\n\n0\n\n*\niii ?????

The conductivity of neat \n\nPVDF can be divided into two different regimes. The first one, for low frequencies, is \n\nmainly dominated by the dc conductivity and it is detected by the low-frequency plateau \n\nshown in the plot. The second regime, for higher frequencies, is characterized by a \n\nfrequency dependent conductivity, what evidences the ac conductivity with MWS \n\ncontributions and dipolar relaxation modes at still higher frequencies.

This fact reveals that the contribution of NaY \n\nzeolite is mainly on the ac conductivity. As it will be shown below, the MWS \n\ncontributions becomes predominant on the dc conductivity contribution to permittivity.  \n\n-1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n-12\n\n-11\n\n-10\n\n-9\n\n-8\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n 353K\n\n 373K\n\n 393K\n\n 413K\n\n 423K\n\n \n\n \n\nL\no\n\ng\n (\n?\n\n')\n /\n\n S\n.m\n\n-1\n\nLog(?) / Rad.s-1\n\n 263K\n\n 273K\n\n 283K\n\n 293K\n\n 313K\n\n 333K\n\n \n\n-1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n-11\n\n-10\n\n-9\n\n-8\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\nLog(?) / Rad.s-1\nL\n\no\ng\n\n (\n?\n\n''\n) \n\n/ \nS\n\n.m\n-1\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n-1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n-12\n\n-10\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\nLog(?) / Rad.s-1\n\nL\no\n\ng\n (\n?\n\n')\n /\n S\n\n.m\n-1\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n-1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n-11\n\n-10\n\n-9\n\n-8\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\nLog(?) / Rad.s-1\n\nL\no\n\ng\n (\n?\n\n''\n) \n\n/ \nS\n\n.m\n-1\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n-1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n-9\n\n-8\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\nL\no\n\ng\n (\n?\n\n')\n /\n\n S\n.m\n\n-1\n\nLog(?) / Rad.s-1\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n-1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n-9\n\n-8\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\nL\no\n\ng\n (\n?\n\n''\n) \n\n/ \nS\n\n.m\n-1\n\n \n \n\nLog (?) / Rad.s\n-1\n\n \n\nFigure 5.7 Real and imaginary parts of the electrical conductivity as a function of frequency at different \n\ntemperatures for PVDF (a) and (b), PVDF/NaY4% composites (c) and (d) and PVDF/NaY16% \n\ncomposites (e) and (f) \n\n(a) \n(b) \n\n(c) \n(d) \n\n(e) (f) \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n102 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\nThe evaluation of the dependence of the conductivity with temperature at different \n\nfrequencies was performed with the help of the Dyre model.

The sample of PVDF/NaY16% keeps almost constant values of the \n\nactivation energy independently of the frequency. Furthermore, the introduction of NaY \n\nstrongly reduces the activation energy when compared with the pure polymer and \n\ndecreases for increasing zeolite content due to the presence of the MWS relaxation \n\nprocess and electric charge transport [29]. \n\n \n\nPure ohmic contributions, characterized by the rapid increase of ?\u2019\u2019 with decreasing \n\nfrequency according to \n\n??\n\n?''?\n?\ndc\n\n?\n0\n?\n\n while ?\u2019 is constant, produce in the modulus \n\nformalism a Debye-like relaxation process whose relaxation time increases with \n\nincreasing dc conductivity. Further, the MWS process is seen both in the permittivity \n\nand the dielectric modulus formalisms as a narrow relaxation peak, the relaxation time \n\nscaling with the reciprocal of the sum of the conductivities of the two phases that create \n\nthe interface polarization [24]. \n\nIn the context of ionic conductors, the complex electric modulus is often applied.

In the case of PVDF the different isotherms overlap on a single master \n\ncurve in the lower frequency side while the half-width of the peak decreases with \n\nincreasing temperatures due to deviations in the high frequency side of the peak. In \n\ncomposites, in addition of the peak observed in PVDF, another peak appears at high \n\nfrequencies.  \n\n \n\nThe electric field relaxation due to motions of charge carriers is generally well \n\ndescribed by the empirical Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) function [49, 50]: \n\n? ? ? ?? ?,exp ???\nM\n\ntt ?? 10 ???                                 (5.8) \n\nwhere \nM\n\n?  and ? are the conductivity relaxation time and the Kohlrauch exponent, \n\nrespectively. The smaller the value of ?, the large the deviation of the relaxation with \n\nrespect to a Debye-type relaxation (?=1). \n\nValues of the Kohlrauch exponential parameter ? of the KWW function were \n\napproximately estimated by means of [51]: \n\nw\n1 4.1??                                                           (5.9) \n\nwhere w  is the peak\u2019s full width at half maximum. \n\nFor the pure polymer (Figure 5.10 (a)), the value of ? is practically constant from 0.57 \n\nat 60\u00baC to 0.63 at 150\u00baC and the asymmetric form of the curve plots for different \n\ntemperatures is associated to an also asymmetric distribution of the relaxation times, \n\nwhat evidence that the dielectric relaxation process deviates from the pure Debye \n\nbehavior. \n\nThe relaxation peak for the pure polymer (Figure 5.10 (a)) occurs at low frequency.  \n\nThis represents the range of frequencies in which charge carriers can move over a long \n\ndistance, i.e., charge carriers can perform successful hopping to a neighboring site [52]. \n\n\n\nDielectric relaxation, ac conductivity and electric modulus in PVDF/NaY  \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  105 \n\nIn the composites with 4 % wt of NaY zeolites, the peak at lower frequencies is \n\ncoincident with the one of pure PVDF and the value of the ? parameter is the same that \n\nwas obtained for pure polymer. On the other hand, the peak present at higher \n\nfrequencies represents a new contribution to interfacial polarization arising in the \n\ninterfaces between zeolite particles and polymer matrix. Since the relaxation time of the \n\nMWS process scales with the reciprocal of conductivity, the higher conductivity of \n\nzeolites due to cations located in different sites of the framework leads the peak to \n\nappear at higher frequencies (lower relaxation times) than in pure PVDF.  \n\n \n\n-6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n \n\n \n\n 60\u00baC\n\n 80\u00baC\n\n 100\u00baC\n\n 120\u00baC\n\n 130\u00baC\n\n 140\u00baC\n\n 150\u00baC\n\nM\n''\n/M\n\n''\nm\n\na\nx\n\nlog (?/?\nmax\n\n)\n\n \n\n-4 -2 0 2 4 6 8\n\n0.00\n\n0.25\n\n0.50\n\n0.75\n\n1.00\n\n1.25\n\nM\n''\n/M\n\n''\nm\n\na\nx\n\nlog (?/?\nmax\n\n)\n \n\n \n\n \n\n-4 -2 0 2 4\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nlog (?/?\nmax\n\n)\n\nM\n''\n/M\n\n''\nm\n\na\nx\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.10 Normalized plots of M''?M''max versus log(???max ) for: PVDF (a), PVDF/NaY4% (b) and \n\nPVDF/NaY16% composite (c). \n\n  \n\n(a) (b) (c) \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n106 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n5.4. Conclusion \n\nStructural and dielectric properties of PVDF/zeolite composite changes significantly \n\nwith respect to pure PVDF. Good dispersion of NaY zeolite particles was assessed by \n\nSEM, although some clustering was observed in the composite with the highest \n\nnanoparticle content. The introduction of the zeolite particles nucleates the \n\ncrystallization of PVDF in the electroactive ? phase and modifies the spherulite size. \n\nBroadband dielectric relaxation spectroscopy shows two regions in the relaxation map \n\nof the composites, the low-temperature one dominated by dipolar relaxations both in \n\nPVDF and in the zeolite particles, with small influence of one phase on the behavior of \n\nthe other. The high temperature side of the spectrum is dominated by ionic conductivity \n\nand interfacial polarization. The presence of the zeolite particles introduce new \n\ndiscontinuity surfaces and increases the MWS contribution that is predominant at low \n\nfrequencies with respect to ohmic contribution to permittivity as detected in the ac \n\nconductivity plots while producing a specific MWS relaxation process due to polymer-\n\nzeolite interfaces.  \n\n\n\nDielectric relaxation, ac conductivity and electric modulus in PVDF/NaY  \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  107 \n\n5.5.

Introduction \n\nThe mixing of polymers and clays has been widely investigated in recent years mainly \n\ndue the mechanical reinforcement effect of the latter. The main goal has been to replace \n\ntraditional fibre reinforced composites due to improved strength and stiffness stability, \n\nthermal and barrier properties and flame retardant behaviour of the clay composites[1-\n\n3]. One interesting polymer for composites production is poly(vinylidene fluoride), \n\nPVDF, due to its remarkable electroative properties and therefore its suitability for \n\nsensor and actuator applications. Furthermore, PVDF films present high flexibility, high \n\nmechanical resistance, dimensional stability, lightness, moldability, low cost production \n\nand low mechanical and acoustic impedance [4]. Depending on the processing \n\nconditions PVDF, with a chemical formula (CH2-CF2)n, can crystallise in at least four \n\ndifferent phases: ?, ?, ? and ? [5, 6]. The ?-phase, that has an alternating s-trans and s-\n\ngauche C-C bonds, is the most stable when the material is cooled from the melt and \n\ntherefore the most commonly obtained [5]. The ?-phase, with all C-C bonds in the s-\n\ntrans conformation (TTTT), is the one that presents the best electroactive piezoelectric \n\nand pyroelectric properties and is commonly obtained by mechanical stretching of the \n\n?-phase [7] or by the addition of selected nanoparticles [8, 9]. The ?-phase is, as the ?-\n\nphase, electrically active. However, due the presence of a g-gauche bond every fourth \n\nrepeat units of C-C band (T3GT3  ), this effect if weaker when compared with ?-phase. \n\n?-phase can be obtained by crystallization from the melt or solution casting at \n\ntemperatures near the melt temperature of the ?-phase. The ? ? solid state phase \n\ntransformation also can occur by annealing at temperatures close to melt temperature \n\n[10]. \n\nIn the last years, the literature reports some studies where organically modified clays \n\nshow the ability to induce, by melt intercalation or solution casting, the crystallization \n\nof the electroactive ?-phase of PVDF [11-14] and, in a few studies, the induction of a \n\ncrystalline ?-phase [14, 15].\n \n\nThe distribution, intercalation and exfoliation of organically modified silicates prepared \n\nfrom Cloisite and Montmorillonite clays has been investigated and it is concluded that \n\nthe trend of PVDF to crystallize in the ?-phase is higher in organically modified clays \n\nwhen compared with unmodified clays [11]. In all cases, the full ?-phase crystallization \n\nis obtained by inclusion of an amount of clay higher than 1.5 wt%.[16]. The full ?-phase \n\ncrystallization of PVDF has also been achieved for lower clay contents, of the order of \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n114 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n0.025 %, by an improved method; however, this method implies a very high \n\nconsumption of material [13]. In general, the toughness of composites, the melting and \n\ncrystallization temperature and also the crystallization rate increases with the \n\nintroduction of nanoparticles and, conversely, the crystallinity of the composites \n\ndecreases [16-18]. \n\nOn the other hand, a few number of more recent studies indicate that the ?-phase of \n\nPVDF is nucleated in the presence of the organoclays. It was demonstrated that when \n\nthe composite samples are subjected to a slow cooling  from the melt, the presence of \n\nthe organoclays induce the crystallization of a mixture of ?-phase and ?-phase, the ?-\n\nphase being predominant for organoclay concentrations above 1.5 wt% [15]. On the \n\nother hand, when the sample is subjected to a melt-quenched-annealing process, the \n\ncomposites crystallize in a mixture of ?- and ?-crystals [15]. Finally, a recent study \n\nconcluded that though the melt-crystallization at hight supercooling  the ?-phase is also \n\nobtained for an organoclay content up to 0.1%, in contrast to cold-crystallized samples, \n\nwhere organoclays addition results in ?-phase PVDF [14]. \n\nSome of the results presented in the above mentioned articles are contradictory, which \n\nresult from the confusion generated on the identification of the ?- and ?-phase. Due to \n\nthe s-trans conformation (TTTT) of the ?-phase of PVDF and the (T3GT3  ) \n\nconformation of the ?-phase of the polymer, their characteristic FTIR bands and X-ray \n\ndiffraction bands typically used for the identification of the phases either coincide or are \n\nvery close to each other, making difficult to distinguish it. Based on literature results, \n\nthe analysis of Table 6.1 allows to precisely identifying the FTIR absorption bands of \n\nthe crystalline phases of PVDF. \n\nFrom Table 6.1 it is important to notice that most of the bands typically used for the \n\nidentification of the electroactive ?- and ?-phases of the polymer, in particular those at \n\n510, 512, 833, 838, 840, 883 and 884 cm\n-1\n\n (shadow in Table 6.1) are actually \n\nsuperposition of  ?- and ?-phase absorption bands, when both phases exist. On the other \n\nhand, just the peaks at 445 and 467 cm\n-1\n\n are characteristic absorption bands of the ?-\n\nphase without superposition with other absorptions and just the absorption bands at 431, \n\n812 and 1234 cm\n-1\n\n are characteristic of the ?-phase without superposition with \n\nabsorptions from other phases [19-22].  \n\nFurther, in the previous articles reporting on the nucleation of the electroactive phase of \n\nthe polymer by clays, the piezoelectric response and optical properties of the material \n\n\n\nNucleation of ?-phase and enhancement of optical transparency in PVDF/clay  \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  115 \n\nhas never been discussed, which are the key issues for the use of the material in sensor \n\nand actuator applications. \n\n \n\nTable 6.1 FTIR absorption bands characteristics of the ?-, ?- and ?-phases of PVDF [19-22] \n\n?-phase \n\n(cm\n-1\n\n) \n\n?-phase \n\n(cm\n-1\n\n) \n\n?-phase \n\n(cm\n-1\n\n) \n\n408 445\n \n\n431\n \n\n532 467\n \n\n440 \n\n614 510\n \n\n512\n \n\n764 840\n \n\n776 \n\n796 884\n \n\n812\n \n\n855 1175 833, 838\n \n\n976 \n\n1149 \n\n1275 883\n \n\n1210  1234\n \n\n1383  1117 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn the present work, the main problems that exist in the processing of electroactive \n\nPVDF through the nucleation with clays are addressed. It is shown that it is possible to \n\nprepare PVDF/clay composite in the ?-phase with low clay contents, without any \n\norganic treatment and with a low consumption of material. Moreover, the material \n\npresents increased transmittance in the visible range, making it appropriate for optical \n\napplications. It is also shown that the material can be poled and the d33 piezoelectric \n\ncoefficient has been measured as a function of the clay and the ?-phase contents. A \n\nsystematic study of the isothermal crystallization kinetics of PVDF with unmodified \n\nclays with the main goal of elucidating the influence of clay content in the \n\ncrystallization kinetics and therefore in the nucleation of the electroactive ?-phase of \n\nPVDF was also performed. Finally, it is shown that different clays can be used in order \n\nto achieve the electroactive polymer phase. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n116 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n6.2. Experimental \n\nPVDF/clay composites with an average thickness of 50 \u00b5m were prepared by spreading \n\na solution of 1.0 g of PVDF powder (Solef 1010) with a suspension of montmorillonite \n\nK10 (Aldrich) in 4 mL of N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) in a glass slide. Previously, \n\nthe suspension of montmorillonite and DMF was homogenized by placing it in an \n\nultrasound bath for 4h before the polymer was added and dissolved with a magnetic \n\nstirrer. After this process the composite is typically melted at 210\u00baC and recrystallised to \n\nroom temperature [23]. Since the clay can suffer structural modifications at this \n\ntemperatures [24, 25], six films with a clay concentration of 0.50 wt% were prepared at \n\ntemperatures between 170 \u00baC and 220 \u00baC in order to study the effect of the polymer \n\nmelting temperature during composite preparation. The effect of clay concentration on \n\nthe electroactive phase content was further studied in films with 0.10, 0.25 and 0.50 \n\nwt% of montmorillonite. The effect of different clay structures was studied by \n\nincorporating an amount of 0.50 % of kaolinite (from North of Portugal) and laponite \n\n(Laport Industries Ltd) into the polymer matrix by the same procedure explained \n\nabove.Finally, a systematic study of the isothermal crystallization kinetics of PVDF \n\nwith montmorillonite clay was performed. \n\nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was performed using a FEI Nova 200 NanoSEM \n\nwith an acceleration voltage of 15 kV in order to evaluate the morphology and \n\nmicroestructure of the clay and the composite. \n\nThe crystalline phase of PVDF on the composites was determined by Fourier \n\nTransformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) in the ATR mode (Spectrum 100, \n\nAttenuated Total Reflectance mode) in the range between 650 and 4000 cm\n?1\n\n, on 32 \n\nscans. \n\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out in a X\u2019Pert Pro-MPD advanced \n\ndiffractometer equipped with Cu K? radiation operated at 50 kV and 40 mA in order to \n\nstudy the polymer phase and clay behaviour. \n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed in a Mettler Toledo DSC 823 \n\napparatus under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10?0.2\u00baC.min\n-1\n\n in order to \n\nevaluate the crystalline fraction of the polymer and the influence of the clay on the \n\nmelting behaviour. \n\n\n\nNucleation of ?-phase and enhancement of optical transparency in PVDF/clay  \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  117 \n\nIn order evaluate the piezoelectric response of the samples, films were first subjected to  \n\na Corona discharge under previously optimized conditions of 70 \u00baC of temperature \n\ninside a home-made chamber under an electric field of 30 kV and a constant current of \n\n15 \u00b5A during 75 minutes. Still under the application of the field, the films were cooled \n\ndown to 30\u00baC. The piezoelectric d33 response was measured with a Wide Range d33-\n\nmeter (Model 8000, APC Int Ltd). \n\nThe complex dielectric constant as a function of frequency was measured between 100 \n\nHz and 1 MHz with anautomatic Quadtech 1929 Precision LCR meter, after thermal \n\ndeposition of gold electrodes on the sample.  \n\nMeasurements of optical transmittance were performed with an optical \n\nspectrophotometer Shimatzu UV-3101PC in the range of 400 to 700 nm. \n\nDynamic mechanical analysis was performed with a DMA 8000 Perkin-Elmer set-up in \n\nthe composites with different clay types and a clay concentration of 0.5 %. The \n\nmeasurements were performed at room temperature with a frequency scan from 0.01 to \n\n10 Hz. \n\nCrystallization kinetics was studies by polarized optical microscopy (POM). An optical \n\nmicroscope with a polarized light (Leica DM 2500M) provided with a Leica DFC-295 \n\ncamera was used to obtain images during the crystallization of the composites. In a \n\nLinkam LTS 350 hot plate, the samples were first melted at 190 \u00baC in order to remove \n\nthe thermal story of the samples and then were cooled down to different temperatures, at \n\na rate of 30 \u00baC/s. In this way, samples with 0.25% of clays were crystallized at 150, 155 \n\nand 160 \u00baC and samples with 0.10% and 0.50 % were isothermally crystallized at 160 \n\n\u00baC. It is to notice that the crystallization temperature is far from the degradation \n\ntemperature of both polymer and fillers. With the aim to simulate the preparation \n\nconditions of ?-phase films, samples with 0.25% of clay were melted and crystallized \n\nalso isothermally at room temperature after fast cooling from the melt. Crystallization of \n\neach sample initiates therefore at different times and is from there that crystallization \n\ntime began to be counted. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n118 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n6.3. Results and Discussion \n\n \n\n6.3.1. Effect of the melting temperature  \n\nPVDF films are usually prepared by solution cast and melting at a range of temperatures \n\nhigher than 200\u00baC [17], which corresponds to the temperature of clays interlayer water \n\nelimination and therefore a temperature range in which structural modifications can \n\noccur.[24, 25] Due this fact, it becomes important to study the influence of the melting \n\ntemperature in the final properties of the composites, as the polymer/clay interfacial \n\ninteraction will be modified during the crystallisation of the polymer matrix. \n\nIn order to study this effect, composites of PVDF with 0.5 %wt of montmorillonite were \n\nmelted at different temperatures and cooled to room temperature.

For the calculation of the relative amount of each polymorph present in \n\nthe polymer, some bands between 700 and 1500 cm\n-1\n\n of the FTIR spectra have been \n\nidentified to correspond to the ?-, ? and ?-phases of the polymer (Table 6.1) [26] and \n\ncan be used for this purpose. \n\n\n\nNucleation of ?-phase and enhancement of optical transparency in PVDF/clay  \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  119 \n\nAs previously mentioned, the proximity or even the superposition of FTIR absorption \n\nbands of the ?- and ?-phase of PVDF led to a large number of contradictions in the \n\nphase identification of composites. However, the analysis of the FTIR spectra in parallel \n\nwith Table 6.1 and with the support of recent studies [14, 15] allows to conclude that \n\ncomposites of PVDF with clays melted at a temperature not exceeding 200\u00baC fully \n\ncrystallize in the ?-phase. In particular, Figure 6.1 shows a strong decrease of the 764, \n\n976, 1149 and 1383 cm\n-1\n\n bands, characteristics from the ?-phase with respect to the \n\ncomposites prepared after melting at higher temperatures. On the other hand, the peaks \n\nat 812, 833, 838 and 1234 cm\n-1\n, characteristics of the ?-phase, suffer a strong increase. \n\nNo representative amount of ?-PVDF is identified in the samples as no characteristic \n\npeaks identified just with this phase suffer any modification with the processing \n\ntemperature (Table 6.1), as it is proved to occur when this phase is nucleated in other \n\nclay composites [14, 15]. \n\nThe relative amount ?-phase (F(?)) present in the samples and shown in Table 6.2 was \n\ncalculated applying a previously developed method (equation 6.1) for the quantification \n\nof the polymer phase content [7, 27, 28], assuming that the crystalline phase content of \n\nthe polymer is either in the ? or ?-phase [20], with no or small traces of ?-phase: \n\n \n\n                                      (6.1) \n\n \n\nHere, A? and A? represent the absorbencies at 766 and 833 cm\n?1\n\n, which correspond to the \n\n?- and the ?-phase material; K?and K?are the absorption coefficients at the respective \n\nwave numbers and X? and X? the degree of crystallinity of each phase. The value of K? is \n\n0.365 and the value of K? is 0.150 \u00b5m\n-1 \n\n[20].\n \n\nWhen the melting of the composite occurs at temperatures above 210\u00baC, the polymer \n\nrecrystallizes in the ?-phase and this tendency increases for higher temperatures. On the \n\nother hand, when the material is melted at temperatures below 200\u00baC, it tends to \n\ncrystallize in the ?-phase (Table 6.2). It should be stressed that this fact does not occur \n\nin the absence of the clays, when the polymer always crystallises in the ?-phase \n\nindependently of the previous melting temperature of the material.  \n\n \n\n \n\n????\n\n?\n\n??\n\n?\n?\n\nAAKK\n\nA\n\nXX\n\nX\nF\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n)/(\n)(\n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n120 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\nTable 6.2 ?-phase content, calculated by equation 6.1, for PVDF/montmorillonite composites obtained by \n\nrecristallization after melting at different temperatures. \n\nTemperature (\u00baC) Percentage of ?-phase (%) \n\n170 97 \n\n180 98 \n\n190 96 \n\n200 95 \n\n210 0 \n\n220 0 \n\n \n\nThe nucleation of the electroactive ?-phase is due to an interaction between the \n\nnegatively charged delaminated clays and the dipolar moments of the PVDF. This ion-\n\ndipole interaction tends to order the PVDF monomers in a preferentially  trans \n\nconformation inducing therefore the crystallization of the ?- or ?-phases [15]. The \n\nstabilization of either ? or ?-phase is not understood and depends on factors such as \n\ncooling rate and surface modification of the clays [14, 15]. \n\nOn the other hand, by increasing meting temperature, the reduction of the interlayer \n\nspacing of the clays at temperatures above 200 \u00baC due the elimination of interlayer \n\nwater [25] prevents the exfoliation of montmorillonite which in turn reduces the contact \n\narea between the negatively charged delaminated clays and the dipolar moments of \n\nPVDF, preventing its crystallization of the electroactive phases. The interlayer water \n\nelimination and the collapse of the interlayer distance is confirmed by the disappearance \n\nof the d(001) diffraction peak [29], attributed to the interlayer distance, at 2? ~ 9\u00ba, in the \n\nXRD patterns for samples prepared at temperatures above the 200\u00baC (Figure 6.2 (a)) \n\nand (b)), inset).  \n\n  \n\n\n\nNucleation of ?-phase and enhancement of optical transparency in PVDF/clay  \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  121 \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n(a)\n\nIn\nte\n\nn\ns\n\nit\ny\n\n (\na\n\n.u\n.)\n\n\u00ba2?  \n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700 (b)\n\nIn\nte\n\nn\ns\n\nit\ny\n\n (\na\n\n.u\n.)\n\n\u00ba2?  \n\nFigure 6.2 XRD patterns for PVDF/clay composite melted at 200 \u00baC (a) and 210 \u00baC (b), respectively.  \n\nThe XRD patterns also confirm that  when the sample is melted at 210 \u00baC it crystallizes \n\nin the ?-phase of PVDF, with characteristic peaks at 17.7, 18.4 and 19.9\u00ba and that when \n\nthe sample is melted at 200\u00baC, the XRD patterns show the peaks at  18.5, 19.2, 20.1, \n\n20.3 and 26.8, characteristic of the ?-phase (Figure 6.2). \n\nWith respect to the morphology of the composites, SEM images (Figure 6.3) show a \n\nuniform distribution of the clay within the polymer matrix and a non-porous, compact \n\nmicrostructure of the polymer matrix, independently of the melting temperature. \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFigure 6.3 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the composites with 0.5% of \n\nmontmorillonite melted at 170\u00baC (a), (b) and 220\u00baC (c), (d). \n\n(c) (d) \n\n(a) (b) 1 \u00b5m \n\n5 \u00b5m 1 \u00b5m \n\n5 \u00b5m \n\n5 6 7 8 9 10\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nIn\nte\n\ns\nit\n\ny\n (\n\na\n.u\n\n.)\n\n\u00ba2? 5 6 7 8 9 10\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nIn\nte\n\nn\ns\n\nit\ny\n\n (\na\n\n.u\n.)\n\n\u00ba2?\n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n122 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\nOn the other hand, as observed in Figure 6.3, the montmorillonite microstructure \n\nchanges for the different composite prepared after melting at different temperatures. For \n\nthe samples prepared at lower temperatures (Figure 6.3 (a) and (b)), platelets of some \n\nnanometric layers are well separated one another and dispersed in different directions \n\nalong the continuous polymer matrix. In this situation, there is a larger interaction area \n\nbetween these clay platelets of montmorillonite and the polymer (Figure 6.3(b)), the \n\npolymer microstructure growing from the clay layers. On the other hand, when the \n\npolymer is melted at temperatures above 200\u00baC, the clays create larger micrometer size \n\nclusters due to the interlayer structural variations. This fact reduces the interaction area \n\nbetween the clays and the polymer matrix and do not promote the crystallization of the \n\nelectroactive phase. \n\nThe composites in the ?- and ?-phases show also different optical transmittance to the \n\nvisible light. Measurements of optical transmittance are presented in Figure 6.4, \n\ndemonstrating that for melting temperatures equal or less than 200 \u00baC the transmittance \n\nin the visible region of the composite is much higher than for the melting temperatures \n\nabove it. This fact is attributed to the variations of the clay microstructure and its \n\ndispersion in the polymer matrix, as well as its influence, as it will be shown later, on \n\nthe degree of crystallinity of the polymer. As observed in Figure 6.3, for processing \n\ntemperatures below 200 \u00baC the dispersion of the clays is better achieved, as well as the \n\nwetting by the polymer. Further, the clay is dispersed in the form of small platelets of \n\nsome clay nanometric layers. These factors imply a better optical transmittance than the \n\nlarger clay grains not so well dispersed and with worst interaction with the polymer \n\nmatrix obtained for the samples melted at higher temperatures, that create defective \n\nmicrostructure e.g. voids and cracks (Figure 6.3 (c) and (d)). \n\n\n\nNucleation of ?-phase and enhancement of optical transparency in PVDF/clay  \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  123 \n\n400 450 500 550 600 650 700\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\n80\n\n85\n\n90\n\n220 \u00baC\n\n210 \u00baC\n\n200 \u00baC\n\n190 \u00baC\n\n180 \u00baC\n\n170 \u00baC\n\nT\nra\n\nn\ns\n\nm\nit\n\na\nn\n\nc\ne\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\nWavelength (nm)\n \n\nFigure 6.4 Optical transmittance in the visible range of PVDF/ montmorillonite composites after \n\nprocessing at different melting temperatures. \n\n \n\nFigure 6.4 also shows that the transmittance of the films is higher as the melting \n\ntemperature approaches 200\u00baC.

Functionally graded electroactive composites  \n\nThe relationship between the processing temperature and the polymer phase after \n\nrecrystalisation allows the production of samples with different electroactive phase \n\ncontent and transmittance along the films, with potential application as functionally \n\ngraded materials in electrical, optical and electrooptical areas [30, 31]. This effect can \n\nbe achieved by exposing different parts of the film to different temperatures. In this \n\nway, a film of 14 cm was exposed to a temperature gradient from ~210 to 180 \u00baC along \n\nits length and the optical transmittance and phase content were determined at different \n\npoints 2 cm apart along the film (the points were numbered 1 to 6, from the higher to \n\nthe lower temperature side).

However, when \n\n0.25 wt% of montmorillonite is introduced there is a decrease of the 764, 976, 1149 and \n\n1383 cm\n-1\n\n peaks, characteristics of the ?-phase and a corresponding appearance of the \n\n812, 833-838 and 1234 cm\n-1\n\n peaks, assigned to the ?-phase [7]. The increase of \n\nmontmorillonite concentration induces even further the nucleation of the ?-phase. For a \n\npercentage of 0.50 wt%, the ?-phase completely disappears and the ?-phase is further \n\nenhanced, at a maximum value of ~ 90%. Table 6.4 also shows the degree of \n\ncrystallinity of the polymer composites as measured by DSC (Figure 6.7) and calculated \n\nby Equation 6.2: \n\n \n\n    \n   \n\n     \n                                                           (6.2) \n\n \n\nwhere     represents the melting enthalpy of the composite and       (taken as 104,6 \n\nJ/g) [20] is the melting enthalpy for a 100% crystalline sample of pure PVDF. \n\nIt is observed that the degree of crystallinity is affected by the amount of clay present in \n\nthe composite. The composite shows a decrease of the degree of crystallinity when the \n\nclay, for small clay concentrations, acts as a defect in the polymer structure, with no \n\ncapability of nucleation of the electroactive phase. Further, by increasing clay content \n\nthe clay seeds act as nucleating agents of the ?-phase and the degree of crystallinity \n\nincreases. \n\n120 140 160 180 200\n\n1 mW\n0.50%\n\n0.25%\n\n0.10%\n\n?-PVDFH\ne\n\na\nt \n\nF\nlo\n\nw\n E\n\nn\nd\n\no\n U\n\np\n\nTemperature (\u00baC)\n \n\nFigure 6.7 DSC thermograms for ?-PVDF and PVDF with different percentage of montmorillonite. \n\n\n\nNucleation of ?-phase and enhancement of optical transparency in PVDF/clay  \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  127 \n\n \n\nThe aforementioned behaviour is supported by the shape of the DSC scans (Figure 6.7) \n\nobtained for the first heating runs obtained for composites with different amount of \n\nmontmorillonite. The samples with 0.10 %wt of clay maintain the melting peak at the \n\nsame temperature as the ?-phase of PVDF, with a shoulder associated to the presence of \n\ndefects in the films due to the introduction of clays. As the amount of clay is increased, \n\nthe melting peak is shifted to higher temperatures. When the clay reaches a 0.50%wt \n\nconcentration, the peak is at 178\u00baC what corresponds to the melting of the ?-phase \n\ncrystals [10].\n \n\n \n\nFinally, the crystallization of the samples in the ?-phase is further demonstrated by their \n\npiezoelectric d33 response (Table 6.4). It is noteworthy to mention that the piezoelectric \n\ncoefficients, despite being lower than for the ?-phase of the polymer, they are still \n\namong the largest obtained for polymers, are in the range suitable for application and \n\nare obtained avoiding the stretching process necessary to prepare ?-PVDF, which \n\nhinders many applications involving microfabrications techniques [32].\n \nThe lower \n\npiezoelectric response of ?-PVDF with respect to ?-PVDF mainly relies in the different \n\nchain conformations, with more dipolar moments for unit cell contributing to the \n\nelectroactive response in the all-trans chain conformation of ?-PVDF. Finally, there is \n\nalso a contribution of the microstructure to the reduction of the electroactive response: \n\nin the present case, films crystallize in a spherulitic microstructure with random \n\norientation of the polymer chains, conversely to the stretched films that show \n\npreferential chain and crystallite orientation [33]. Finally, the values for the real and \n\nimaginary parts of the dielectric constant are similar to the ones obtained for ?-PVDF \n\n[5] (Table 6.4). \n\n \n\n6.3.4. Effect of the different clays \n\nIn order to further evaluate the origin of the crystallization of the ?-phase of PVDF by \n\nclays, composites of clays with different structures were prepared for a given clay \n\ncontent: montmorillonite, laponite and kaolinite. Montmorillonite is an expanding clay \n\nwith a structure type of 2:1. When exfoliated, it creates plates with a thickness of 1 nm \n\nand a diameter ranging from 50 to 500 nm. Laponite has the same 2:1 clay structure \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n128 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\ntype of montmorillonite, but it shows mesoporosity resulting from interparticle \n\naggregates and can create platelets of 1nm of thickness but with a smaller diameter than \n\nmonmorillonite (~30 nm) [34]. Kaolinite present a 1:1 clay structure type, it has a basal \n\nspacing fixed at 0.72 nm and, unlike the aforementioned clays, is unable to absorb water \n\ninto the interlayer position. All the samples were prepared by solvent cast at a \n\nconcentration of 0.5 %wt and melted at 200\u00baC. The results obtained by FTIR are \n\npresented in Figure 6.8.  \n\n800 1000 1200 1400 1600\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n???\n\nKaolinite 0,5%\n\nLaponite 0,5%\n\n?\n\n \n\n \n\n?\n\nMontmorillonite 0,5%\n\n?-PVDF\n\nT\nra\n\nn\ns\n\nm\nit\n\nta\nn\n\nc\ne\n\n (\na\n\n.u\n.)\n\nWavenumber (cm-1)\n\n \n\n400 450 500 550 600 650 700\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\nLaponite\n\nKaolinite\n\nMontmorillonite\n\n? -?PVDF\nT\n\nra\nn\n\ns\nm\n\nit\na\n\nn\nc\n\ne\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nWavelength?(nm)\n\n \n\nFigure 6.8 a) FTIR-ATR spectra of composites of PVDF with 0.5%wt of montmorillonite, laponite and \n\nkaolinite clays and b) the corresponding optical transmittance spectra in the visible region. \n\nFigure 6.8 (a) shows that the ?-phase content is more pronounced in montmorillonite \n\nsamples, followed by laponite and finally by kaolinite. The piezoelectric ?-phase \n\ncontent, as calculated by equation 6.1, for the different clays are 96 % for \n\nmontmorillonite samples, 80 % for laponite samples and finally 73 % for kaolinite \n\ncomposites. The evolution of the phase content for the different clays can be explained \n\nby the expanding effect observed in the two first clays that is not observed in kaolinite. \n\nThe interparticle aggregates observed on laponite also difficult, on the other hand, its \n\nexfoliation and is responsible for the lower ?-phase content when compared with the \n\nmontmorillonite. As on the case of montmorillonite, the melting of these composite \n\nsamples at temperatures above 200\u00baC, prevents the crystallization of the ?-phase. Figure \n\n6.8 (b) shows the transmittance of the different samples, which also increases for these \n\nclays with respect to pure PVDF. The highest transmittance is obtained for the \n\ncomposite with laponite, followed by montmorillonite and kaolinite. These results can \n\nbe related to the different degree of crystallinity of the polymer within the composites, \n\ni.e., the higher the degree of crystallinity of the composites, the higher is the \n\ntransmittance. This fact is confirmed by the degree of crystallinity obtained by DSC: \n\n(a) (b) \n\n\n\nNucleation of ?-phase and enhancement of optical transparency in PVDF/clay  \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  129 \n\nlaponite, the clay giving origin to the most transparent composite, is also the one with \n\nthe highest degree of crystallinity (59%), followed by montmorillonite (51%) and \n\nkaolinite (46%). \n\nThe different interaction between the clays and the polymer matrix, leading to the \n\ndifferent electroactive phase content and transparency is also supported by the \n\ndynamical mechanical measurements  performed for the three types of composites with \n\n0.5% of clay. The results are represented in Figure 6.9. The higher elastic modulus is \n\nobserved for composites when prepared with montmorillonite and laponite, but a lower \n\nelastic modulus than PVDF is observed when the kaolinite is present. This fact can be \n\nexplained by the larger expanding effect observed on montmorillonite and laponite, that \n\nallows larger interaction areas between the polymer and the layers of the clays and \n\nprevents the composite deformation. On the other hand, the kaolinite is not an \n\nexpanding clay so, the contact area between this clay and the polymer is smaller, \n\nrepresenting therefore a defect that acts as a rupture zone and facilitates the \n\ndeformation. \n\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n\n8.0x10\n6\n\n8.8x10\n6\n\n9.6x10\n6\n\n1.0x10\n7\n\n1.1x10\n7\n\n??- PVDF\n\nLaponite\n\nMontmorillonite\n\nKaolinite\n\nE\n' \n(P\n\na\n)\n\nFrequency?(Hz)\n \n\nFigure 6.9 E\u2019 variation with frequency for ?-PVDF and PVDF/clay composite with 0.50 % of \n\nmontmorillonite, laponite and kaolinite. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n130 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n6.3.5.

It is also observed multiple crystallization \n\nnuclei. For intermediate times (Figure 6.10 (b)), spherulites are fairly big and perfectly \n\ngrowth with the Maltese-cross clearly observed, indicating the polymer crystallization \n\nin the ?-phase of PVDF [14, 36]. On the other hand, it can be observed that some fillers \n\nare pushed away by spherulites as these growth. Furthermore, comparing the three \n\npictures of Figure 6.10 (b), it is confirmed that the size of the spherulites increases with \n\ntime and that the number of spherulites does not vary significantly over time. \n\n \n\n200 ?m 200 ?m 200 ?m \n\n(a) (b) (c) \n\n\n\nNucleation of ?-phase and enhancement of optical transparency in PVDF/clay  \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  131 \n\n   \n\nFigure 6.11 Images of the spherulitic growth for PVDF/MMT composites at 92 s crystallization time at \n\n160 \u00baC with MMT wt% of 0.10 (a), 0.25 (b) and 0.50 (c). \n\n \n\nFigure 6.11 shows the spherulite microstructure as a function of MMT concentration \n\nafter 92 s crystallization time for semi crystalline PVDF with MMT loadings of 0.10%, \n\n0.25% and 0.50% (Figure 6.11 (a) to (c)) crystallized at 160\u00baC. All the samples show \n\nspherulites with a compact and well-defined microstructure and the Maltese-cross \n\ntexture typical of ?-PVDF [23]. The samples with 0.50 % clay content are the ones with \n\nthe largest number of spherulites, while the samples with 0.10% and 0.25% clay content \n\nshow nearly the same number of spherulites. The increase of crystallization nucleus \n\nwith increasing clay content can be attributed to crystallization around the clay surface, \n\nthe filler acting as nucleation agents. \n\nThe results of Figures 6.10 and 6.11 evidence the influence of the present of clays and \n\nthe clay content in the polymer crystallization. It is further important to evaluate the \n\neffect of crystallization temperature for a given filler content. Figure 6.12 shows the \n\nimages of PVDF/MMT0.25% after complete isothermal crystallization at the temperatures \n\nof 160 \u00baC, 155 \u00baC, 150 \u00baC and room temperature. It is observed that decreasing \n\ncrystallization temperature increases the number of crystallization sites of the PVDF \n\npolymer similarly to the neat PVDF polymer [37]. As demonstrated by Figure 6.12, the \n\npresence of MMT leads increasing PVDF nucleation sites and and crystallization. \n\n \n\n(a) (b) (c) \n\n200 ?m 200 ?m 200 ?m \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n132 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n \n\nFigure 6.12 Images of the spherulites of PVDF/MMT0.25% composites after total crystallization at 160 \u00baC \n\n(a), 155 \u00baC (b), 150 \u00baC (c) and room temperature (d). \n\n \n\nThe spherulites therefore become smaller with decreasing crystallization temperature, \n\nloosing also the definition of their borders. On the other hand, the characteristic \n\nMaltese-cross is also not observed. \n\nPOM pictures of PVDF/MMTroom temperature at different times during the crystallization \n\nprocess are represented on Figure 6.13. A much faster spherulite growth with a higher \n\nnumber of spherulites is observed when compared to the previously described \n\ncrystallization situations. Not only the number of spherulites, but also the spherulite \n\ntype is different, as they show an irregular shape with no clear-cut boundary and with \n\nthe absence of the Maltese-cross and birefringence. The full crystallization occurs in \n\nless than 5 seconds. It is to notice that after these conditions the ?-phase of PVDF is \n\nobtained, as concluded above. \n\n \n\n   \n\nFigure 6.13 Images of the spherulitic growth for PVDF with 0.25% of Montmorillonite samples \n\nsubjected to crystallization at room temperature at different periods of crystallization: 8 s (a); 11 s (b) and \n\n13 s (c). \n\n \n\n200 ?m \n\n(a) (b) (c) \n\n200 ?m 200 ?m \n\n\n\nNucleation of ?-phase and enhancement of optical transparency in PVDF/clay  \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  133 \n\nAs a conclusion, the addition of MMT fillers increases the number of spherulites, but \n\nthe spherulite size decreases with increasing MMT concentration for a given \n\ncrystallization time and temperature when compared with pristine PVDF [23]. These \n\nfacts confirm that the MMT fillers act as heterogeneous nucleation agents. \n\nThe crystallization behavior was quantified by determining the spherulitic growth rates \n\nby measuring the radius of the spherulites as a function of time at the different \n\ncrystallization temperatures. Typical relationships of spherulite radius versus time at \n\ndifferent crystallization temperatures for the PVDF/MMT0.25% composite are illustrated \n\nin Figure 6.14. The radius of the spherulites increases linearly with time and the \n\ncrystallization rate decreases with increasing crystallization temperature. As on neat \n\nPVDF [23], the total crystallization is faster achieved for lower crystallization \n\ntemperatures. In Figure 6.14, for the lowest isothermal crystallization temperature, \n\nT=150 \u00baC, the spherulite size is small and the crystallization behavior is faster. For \n\nhighest crystallization temperatures, 160 \u00baC, the crystallization is slower and the \n\nspherulite size is larger. \n\n-5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n \n\n \n\nTime (minutes)\n\nR\na\n\nd\niu\n\ns\n (\n?\nm\n\n)\n\n 150 \u00baC\n\n 155 \u00baC\n\n 160 \u00baC\n\n room temperature\n\n \n\nFigure 6.14 Spherulitic growth of PVDF/MMT composites with 0.25% MMT content isothermally \n\ncrystallized at 150, 155, 160 \u00baC and room temperature.

This fact is not fully responsible for the nucleation of the ?-phase of PVDF as \n\n?-PVDF is obtained when the samples crystallize isothermally close to the melting \n\ntemperature (Figures 6.10 to 6.12), but favors the formation of the ?-phase of PVDF at \n\nlower temperature crystallization or under non-isothermal crystallization conditions \n\nprocessing conditions. \n\n0 10 20 30 40\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n \n\n \n\nR\na\n\nd\niu\n\ns\n (\n?\nm\n\n)\n\nTime (min)\n\n 0.10 %\n\n 0.25 %\n\n 0.50 %\n\n ?-PVDF\n\n ?-PVDF\n\n \n\nFigure 6.15 Spherulitic growth of ?-PVDF, ?-PVDF and composites with 0.10, 0.25 and 0.50 % of MMT \n\nfillers with a crystallization temperature of 160 \u00baC. \n\n \n\nFor same crystallization temperature (T=160\u00baC), it is thus evident that the interfacial \n\ninteraction between MMT fillers and PVDF is responsible for the differences in growth \n\nrate observed in Figures 6.14 and 6.15. This result is related to the higher number of \n\nnucleus found in the PVDF/MMT composites (Figure 6.11). \n\nKeeping all other parameters unchanged, a higher number of nuclei implies smaller \n\nspherulites [38]. The appearance of germ nuclei in the polymer system is governed by \n\nprimary nucleation phenomena and after the primary nuclei is established the spherulite \n\ngrowth rate is determined by surface nucleation and subsequent crystal growth [39].  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nNucleation of ?-phase and enhancement of optical transparency in PVDF/clay  \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  135 \n\nCrystallization kinetics \n\nThe overall isothermal crystallization kinetics of polymers is determined by the \n\nnucleation rate and growth rates [40] and is commonly analyzed within the Avrami \n\ntheory, as represented by equation 6.3 [40-42]: \n\n)exp(1\nn\n\nt\nKtX ???                                           (6.3) \n\nHere, n  is a constant that depends on the type of nucleation and growth, its value ranges \n\nbetween 1 and 4 and is related to the different crystallization mechanisms [40, 41]. K  is \n\nthe crystallization rate constant involving both nucleation and growth rate parameters \n\nunder isothermal conditions. tX  and t  are the relative crystallinity and the \n\ncrystallization time, respectively. \n\nFrom images similar to the ones presented in Figures 6.10 or 6.11 obtained by POM at \n\nregular time intervals during the crystallization process, the time, t , evolution of the \n\ncrystallized fraction ? ?tX  of the material was calculated from the evolution of \n\ncrystallized areas as a function of time ? ?tA ?? : \n\n? ?\n\n? ? ?\n?\n\n?\n\n???\n\n???\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\nA\n\nA\n\nttA\n\nttA\n\nX\n\nt\n\nt\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n                                                 (6.4) \n\nwhere the numerator represents the crystallized area at a given time and the \n\ndenominator is the total area of the fully crystallized material [37].  \n\nIn Figure 6.16 are represented the relative crystallinity determined by equation 6.4 as a \n\nfunction of time for PVDF and PVDF/MMT0.25% crystallized at different temperatures. \n\nAll curves show the typical sigmoidal shape of the isothermal crystallization behavior \n\n[23]. Furthermore, the initial slope decreases with increasing crystallization temperature \n\nindependently of the presence of MMT fillers in PVDF, indicating a progressively \n\nslower crystallization rate. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n136 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0 150\u00baC, PVDF\n155\u00baC, PVDF\n\n160\u00baC, PVDF\n\n 150\u00baC, 0.25% MMT\n\n 155\u00baC, 0.25% MMT\n\n 160\u00baC, 0.25% MMT\n\n \n\n \n\nt /s\n\n?\nt\n\n \n\nFigure 6.16 Crystallization isotherms for different crystallization temperature of ??PVDF and \n\nPVDF/MMT composites with 0.25 % MMT filler content. \n\nFigure 6.16 shows that the characteristic sigmoid isotherms shift to the right (higher \n\ntimes) with increasing isothermal crystallization temperature, which is in agreement \n\nwith the results of Figure 6.14. The comparison between neat PVDF and the composites \n\nshow that the introduction of clays induces a faster increase of the relative crystallinity, \n\ndespite the slower grow rate of the spherulites shown in Figure 6.15, which is the \n\nascribed to the larger number of growing sperulites, i.e, to the nucleation effect of the \n\nfiller. \n\nThe relative crystallinity as a function of time for PVDF/MMT samples with different \n\nfiller concentrations crystallized at T=160 \u00baC is represented in Figure 6.17. The \n\ncharacteristic sigmoid isotherms are observed for all composites, with no significant \n\nvariation between the samples with 0.10% and 0.25% clay content. However, when the \n\nclay content increases to 0.50%, the relative crystallization is faster. Despite the \n\nspherulitic grow rate being similar for all the composites with different clay content \n\n(Figure 6.15), the presence of a larger amount of clay induces a higher number of \n\nnucleation points, accelerating therefore the total crystallization of the sample. \n\nThese facts confirm that MMT fillers in the PVDF matrix act as nucleating agent \n\nincreasing the number of growing spherulites while leading a slower spherulite growth, \n\nmore similar to the one of the ?-phase growth rate (Figure 6.15). \n\n\n\nNucleation of ?-phase and enhancement of optical transparency in PVDF/clay  \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  137 \n\n0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n \n\n \n\n?\nt\n\nt /s\n\n 0.10 %\n\n 0.25 %\n\n 0.50 %\n\n ?-PVDF\n\n \n\nFigure 6.17 Crystallization isotherms of PVDF/MMT composites at 160\u00baC for the different MMT filler \n\ncontents of 0.1%, 0.25% and 0.5%. \n\n \n\nAfter calculation of the relative crystallinity, Figure 6.18 displays the Avrami plots and \n\nrespective fittings obtained from equation 6.5 for the composites at different \n\ncrystallization temperatures. \n\nThe plot of  \n\n? ? tnKX\nt\n\nlnln]1lnln[ ????

The incorporation of MMT fillers significantly \n\nincreased the crystallization rate constant, K , confirming that MMT fillers act as \n\nnucleating agents and overcoming therefore the effect of slower spherulite growth \n\n(Figure 6.15) due to confined growth geometry and clay-polymer interactions due to the \n\npresence of the fillers. \n\nThe higher rate of crystallization of the PVDF with MMT fillers is observed through the \n\nlower values of \n2\n\n1\nt . This fact have been also observed in PVDF/ferrite nanoparticles \n\ncomposites, in which also nucleation of one of the electroactive phases of the polymer \n\noccur [37].  \n\nThe activation energy of the crystallization process can be obtained by applying the \n\nArrhenius equation to the overall crystallization rate constant, K , which contains \n\ncontributions from both nucleation and growth rate: \n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n? ??\n\n?\na tio ncrysta llizRT\n\nE\nn\n\neKK\n0\n\n1\n                                            (6.7) \n\nwhere 0K  is the pre-exponential factor, actE  is the activation energy of the \n\ncrystallization process and the ideal gas constant (R = 8.31 Jmol\n?1\n\n K\n?1\n\n) [45, 46]. \n\nThe activation energy for ?-PVDF and PVDF/MMT0.25% is 524 and 546 kJ/mol, \n\nrespectively. The value of the crystallization activation energy is in the same order of \n\nprevious investigations [47] and combine results of the above two competing effects of \n\nnucleation and restriction of the movement of polymer chains [48]. \n\nFigure 6.19 represent the schematic illustration of a possible mechanism of the initial \n\nspherulite growth for the PVDF/MMT systems adapted from [49]. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n140 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n \n\nThe MMT fillers influence the nucleation of the spherulites and its growth, which also \n\ndepend on crystallization temperature. The large surface area of MMT filler decreases \n\noverall crystallization time of the PVDF polymer due to the increase of the nucleation \n\nefficiency of the filler, but also decreases spherulite growth rate. For lower MMT \n\nconcentration, the larger number of nucleus is due of the exfoliation of the MMT fillers. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.19 Schematic illustration of spherulite growth for PVDF/MMT composites for low MMT \n\ncontents. Adapted from [49] \n\n \n\nFor PVDF/MMT composites crystallized at temperatures higher than 155 \u00b0C, the \n\nmaterial crystallizes in a co-existence of ?- and ?-crystalline phases. With incorporation \n\nof MMT fillers in PVDF matrix, it is observed a lowering of spherulitic growth rate, \n\ncharacteristics of ?-phase. Therefore it is observed that the ?-spherulites grown directly \n\nfrom the melt correlating the presence of the MMT fillers with the nucleation of the ?-\n\nphase of the polymer [50, 51]. Therefore, the slowing of the spherulitic growth rate due \n\nto the presence of the clays and determined by the clay-polymer interactions, is \n\nresponsible by the promotion of the ? crystalline phase of PVDF in the composites. \n\n  \n\nSpherulite \nClays \n\nNucleus \n\n\n\nNucleation of ?-phase and enhancement of optical transparency in PVDF/clay  \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  141 \n\n6.4. Conclusion \n\nThis work shows that electroactive PVDF composites can be directly obtained through \n\nsuitable doping with clays by a processing technique that allows easy integration in \n\nmicrotechnological processes. The obtained electroactive phase is the polymer ?-phase \n\nwith a d33 of -7 pC/N. Further, clay content improves very significantly the optical \n\ntransparency in the visible range. This results also shows that functional graded \n\nelectrical and optical properties can be obtained along the polymer length. Finally, the \n\nslowing of the spherulitic growth rate by the presence of the clays, determined through \n\nthe clay-polymer interaction is also responsible for the promotion of the ?-crystalline \n\nphase of PVDF in the composites. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n142 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n6.5.

Polymer/aluminosilicate composites based \n\napplications \n\n\n\n\n\nPolymer/aluminosilicate composites based applications  \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  147 \n\n7.1. Introduction \n\nThe development of PVDF/aluminosilicate composites with high dielectric constant \n\nand/or conductivity [1-3], high transparency and piezoelectric response [4], that can be \n\ncontrolled by the variation of type, size, shape [2] and amount of aluminosilicates, result \n\nin the possibility of applications as micromechanical systems fabrication as well as in \n\nthe development of sensors and actuators [4]. \n\nFurther, based on the materials developed in this work, applications in different areas \n\nhave emerged. That is the case of the development of PVDF/aluminosilicates \n\ncomposites for the use as battery separator membranes and for biomedical applications. \n\nFor these applications was further important to control the microstructure of the \n\ncomposite, either by achieving porous structures of by preparing microfiber membranes. \n\nIn a similar way some membranes were obtained from a co-polymer from PVDF, in \n\nparticular poly(vinylidene fluoride-Trifluoroethylene), P(VDF-TrFE), due to its specific \n\npore architecture  \n\n\n\n\n\nPolymer/aluminosilicate composites based applications  \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  149 \n\n7.2. PVDF/aluminosilicate composites used as battery \n\nseparator membranes \n\nThe lithium battery industry represents the largest segment of the industry of portable \n\nbatteries for computers, cell phones and cameras. However these batteries still have \n\nsome aspects to improve, in particular related to the high reactivity of the lithium with \n\nthe components of the electrolyte. One solution to this problem could be the use of \n\npolymer electrolytes. \n\nPVDF-TrFE/NaY zeolites porous membranes with different zeolite contents were \n\nprepared for lithium ion battery applications [6]. The zeolite inclusion changes the pore \n\nsize, porosity and uptake of membranes and the tortuosity decreases with increasing \n\nzeolite content indicating that ionic transport is now supported by a better pore \n\nconnectivity. The membranes are thermally stable above 100 \u00baC and the inclusion of the \n\nfillers improves the mechanical strength of the membranes. In addition, the zeolite \n\nparticles form a conducting pathway in the polymeric matrix for high zeolite contents, \n\nimproving the ionic conductivity of the porous membranes, which reaches a maximum \n\nvalue of 2.33*10\n-6\n\n S/cm at room temperature for the P(VDF-TrFE) membrane with 16 \n\nwt%  zeolite content. The overall stability of the porous membrane determined by cyclic \n\nvoltammetry is appropriate for the intended applications with no electrochemical \n\noxidation occurring at potentials lower than 3.0 V. These results shows that the P(VDF-\n\nTrFE)/NaY porous membranes have adequate electrochemical stability, thermal, \n\nmechanical and electrical properties for being used as  battery separators in lithium ion \n\nbatteries [7].Similar results were obtained for P(VDF-TrFE)/Montmorillonite clay \n\nporous membranes [8] \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 3.2 3.4\n\n-11\n\n-10\n\n-9\n\n-8\n\n \n\nL\no\n\ng\n??\n\n (\nS\n\n/c\nm\n\n)\n\n1000/T (K\n-1\n)\n\n 0%\n\n 4%\n\n 16%\n\n 32%\n\n \n\nFigure 7.1 Cross-section SEM Images of the P(VDF-TrFE)/NaY composites with 16 % of NaY (left) and \n\nImpedance modulus as a function of zeolite content (right) \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n150 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n7.3. PVDF/aluminosilicate composites used for \n\nbiomedical applications \n\nNovel materials are continuously developed with the objective of being used in \n\nbiomedical applications. Among these, polymer based materials have confirmed to be a \n\ngood biomaterials choice in tissue engineering applications, smart prostheses and \n\nsensors and controlled drug delivery, among others [9, 10]. In particular the inclusion of \n\nzeolites allows increasing functional properties and controlled drug release [11]. \n\n \n\n7.3.1. Cell growth membrane \n\nThe potential of electroactive polymers has been recognized for biomedical \n\napplications. Due to its ability to convert mechanical, thermal or magnetic signals into \n\nelectrical ones, electroactive polymers can be used as smart scaffolds to stimulate cell \n\ngrowth and compatibility [12]. Once fillers introduction into the polymer matrix can \n\nmodify biomaterial-cell interaction and/or create novel bioactivity or even suppression \n\nof biocompatibility [13, 14], composites based on poly(vinylidene fluoride), PVDF, \n\nhave been evaluated with respect to their biological response. Cell viability and \n\nproliferation were performed in vitro both with Mesenchymal Stem Cells differentiated \n\nto osteoblasts and Human Fibroblast Foreskin [15]. In-vivo tests were also performed \n\nusing six week-old C57Bl/6 mice. It was concluded that zeolite and clay composites are \n\nbiocompatible materials promoting cell response and not showing in vivo pro-\n\ninflammatory effects, which renders both of them attractive for biological applications \n\nand tissue engineering, opening interesting perspectives to development of scaffolds \n\nfrom these composites[15]. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.2 (A) Osteoblast and (B) fibroblast proliferation assessed by radioactive thymidine \n\nincorporation upon incubation with different neat polymer or composites: ?-PVDF, ?-PVDF/CoFe2O4 (40 \n\nwt%), ?-PVDF, ?-PVDF/(PbZr0,53Ti0,47)O3 (10 wt%), ?-PVDF/NaY (32 wt%), ?-PVDF/CNT (5 wt%), ?-\n\nPVDF/Agnanoparticles (0.005 and 0.020 wt%) and ?-PVDF/MMT (4 wt%) \n\n\n\nPolymer/aluminosilicate composites based applications  \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  151 \n\nOn the other hand, cell/biomaterial surface interactions, influenced by surface chemistry \n\nand topology, has become increasingly important in the development of new scaffolds \n\nfor a variety of biomedical applications [16, 17]. One of the most efficient ways to \n\nincrease the surface area of composites consist on the production of microfibers by \n\nelectrospinning [18]. This technique consists on the application of a high electric \n\nvoltage to a droplet of polymeric solution between the needle and the ground \n\ncollector.In vitro assays with PVDF and PVDF composite films and fibers where \n\nperformed to test the viability of the attached MC3T3-E1 cells [19]. The results shows \n\nthat for the first 72 h the PVDF samples do not inhibit the cells adhesion and promote \n\ncell proliferation [19]. So, these PVDF composite renders attractive for biological and \n\nbiomedical applications, such as drug delivery [20, 21], cell culture [22, 23] and \n\nantibacterial agent [24, 25], among others. \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 7.3 Morphology of PVDF/NaY composites electrospun fiber membranes of PVDF/NaY 16% \n\n(left) and MTT absorbance results after cells seeded for 24 h and 72 h on PVDF films (P-F), \n\nrandom fibers (P-R) and oriented fiber (P-O), with 0, 4 and 16 wt% of zeolite (right). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n152 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\n7.3.2. Controlled drug release \n\nP(VDF-TrFE)/zeolite composites show interesting features for drug delivery \n\napplications due to the different microstructures and phases of the polymer, its \n\nbiocompatibility and chemical stability, together with the induced activity of the zeolite, \n\n[5, 7, 15]. A drug release system for ibuprofen based on macroporous poly(vinylidene \n\nfluoride-trifuoroethylene)/zeolite membranes produced by isothermal crystallization \n\nfrom solution in N,N-dimethylformamide was prepared. Pore architecture, consisting in \n\ninterconnected spherical pores, is obtained in which surface the zeolite are placed. The \n\nrelease rate of the drug is dependent on the zeolite content, being slower as higher is the \n\nzeolite percentage on membrane. For all the cases the release rate decreases with time. \n\n \n\n0 5000 10000 15000 20000\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\nC\n\n (\np\n\np\nm\n\n)\n\nTime (min)\n\n P(VDF-TrFE)\n\n P(VDF-TrFE)/NaY 4%\n\n P(VDF-TrFE)/NaY 16%\n\n P(VDF-TrFE)/NaY 32%\n\n \n\nFigure 7.4 Cross-section SEM Image of a P(VDF-TrFE)/NaY membrane (left) and a quantification of \n\nibuprofen release rate by High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (right) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n40?m \n\n\n\nPolymer/aluminosilicate composites based applications  \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  153 \n\n7.4.

Conclusions and future work \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions and future work \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  159 \n\n8.1. Conclusions \n\nElectroactive polymer composites are extensively developed in order to approach \n\nmaterials properties to specific applications. This work was devoted to the development \n\nof poly(vinylidene fluorite)/aluminosilicate composites due to the strong electroactivity \n\nof the polymer matrix, being the main representative of the family of polymers with the \n\nlargest piezo- and ferroelectric response, and to the versatility of the aluminoslicate \n\nfillers, allowing suitable modifications in shape, size and Si/Al ratio, among others, for \n\nachieving specific applications demands. \n\nIn this way, PVDF/zeolite composites were successfully prepared by solvent casting \n\nand melt crystallization. A study of the structural, thermal and electrical properties of \n\nthe PVDF composites prepared with different framework zeolite types (LTL, LTA, \n\nFAU and MFI), different polymer solvents (DMF, DMSO, TEP) and different zeolite \n\n(NaY) concentrations (4, 16, 24 and 32 wt.%) was performed.  \n\nA good distribution of the fillers was obtained in all films that maintain the spherulitic \n\nstructure of neat PVDF as well as its mechanical properties. Further, the degradation \n\ntemperature of PVDF is not significantly affected by the inclusion of the fillers It was \n\nverified that zeolite introduction affects the electrical properties of the polymer and the \n\npolymer phase crystallization. The presence of ions stabilizing the zeolite structure \n\ncauses an increase of the dielectric response of the composite due to its confined \n\nmobility into the zeolites cavities and to interfacial effects associated to Maxwell-\n\nWagner-Sillers polarization. These ions are also responsible for the presence of non-\n\nlinear I-V curves where two regimes are identified separated by a break voltage at \n\nwhich a strong increase of the electrical conductivity takes place. Zeolites structures \n\nwith lower Si/Al ratios are associated to higher number of ions, resulting in a higher \n\ndielectric and electrical response.  \n\nThe dielectric relaxation of the composites shows a low temperature region dominated \n\nby dipolar relaxations of the PVDF and relaxations ascribed to the zeolites, while the \n\nhigh temperature side of the spectrum is dominated by ionic conductivity. The presence \n\nof zeolite particles induces new discontinuity surfaces and increases the Maxwell-\n\nWagner-Sillers contribution. \n\nZeolites with low Si/Al ratios show the ability to completely nucleate the electroactive \n\nphase of the polymer due to strong electrostatic interactions related to the cation \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n160 Ana Catarina Lopes \n\ncontent. A filler content of 16 wt.% is enough to obtain the complete nucleation of the \n\n?-phase of PVDF. A similar effect occurs with montmorillonite clay introduction but \n\njust 0.50 wt.% clay content is enough to completely crystallize the polymer in the \n\nelectroactive ?-phase. The study was completed with kaolinite and laponite clays.  \n\nThe negatively charged delaminated clays and zeolite structures interact with the dipolar \n\nmoments of PVDF polymer. This ion-dipole interaction induces the arrangement of the \n\nPVDF monomers in a preferentially trans conformation that result in the ?-phase \n\nconformation. This effect is limited to preparation conditions including polymer melting \n\ntemperatures below 200 \u00baC. Further, the optical transmittance of the PVDF/clay \n\ncomposites in the visible spectral region is higher than for the neat polymer. In this way, \n\nthe control of temperature throughout the sample allows the production of graded \n\nelectroactive and optical composites. The crystallization rate of the polymer decreases \n\nwith the present of the clay. This fact, ascribed to the strong interfacial electrostatic \n\ninteractions is also related to the crystallization of PVDF in the electroactive ?-phase. \n\nFurthermore, these composites have been also produced in the form of porous and \n\nfibrous membranes which extends the application range of the developed materials. \n\nFinally, the developed polymer based composites have been applied in the areas of \n\nbattery membranes and biomedical applications and present high potential for the \n\ndevelopment of sensors and actuators. \n\n  \n\n\n\nConclusions and future work \n\n Ana Catarina Lopes  161 \n\n8.2. Future work \n\nPVDF/zeolite and PVDF/clay composites revealed to be promising materials for \n\ntechnological applications. In this way, it is interesting to study their upscale production \n\nin order to obtain similar electrical and optical properties by, e.g., extrusion processes, \n\navoiding the use of solvents. \n\nIn a similar way, the upscaling of the porous membranes has to be studied.  \n\nFurther investigation has to be devoted to the effect of the variation of the ion type used \n\nto stabilize the zeolite/clay in the electrical and optical properties of the composites. \n\nFinally, molecules can be encapsulated in the  zeolite pores to further tailor composite \n\nresponse to specific applications. \n\nFinally, materials can be readily used for the development of environmental and bio \n\nsensors that have to be fully characterize with respect to their performance. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\tP\u00e1gina 1\n\tP\u00e1gina 2\n\tP\u00e1gina 3\n\tP\u00e1gina 4"}]}}}
