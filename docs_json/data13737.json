With the of increase of the computational power along the years,\nscientists were able to simulate more complex and longer phenomena, resulting in\nincreasing volumes of data being produced. Then, they face larger and/or highly\ncomplex data sets to analyze. In some situations, scientists want to understand\nthe behavior of their domain of interest in different conditions, and to do so they\nrun multiple simulations with varying parameters. These simulations results con-\nstitute ensemble data sets, and analyzing these data sets demands both overview\nand detailed visual representations, as well as interactive and numerical features for\nexploration purposes. A specific problem domain that can use simulations ensem-\nbles is geochemistry, where scientists often want to study the interaction between\nwater and rocks, which can give an understanding about the conditions oil reser-\nvoirs developed along millions of years. The goal of this work is to help geologists\nand geochemists to explore these complex data through an interactive visualization\ninterface, so they can get insights to answer their questions about the simulated phe-\nnomena. We developed Geochemical Simulation Ensembles Visualization (GEVIs),\na visualization tool, considering experts\u2019 main tasks for exploring these data. The\nsystem was evaluated with a case study and experimental use by experts. Results\nfrom both evaluations suggest that GEVIs comply with the basic requirements users\nhave regarding visualization of ensembles data sets.\n\nKeywords: Visualization, Ensemble, Geochemical Simulations.\n\n\n\nVisualiza\u00e7\u00e3o de M\u00faltiplas Execu\u00e7\u00f5es de Simula\u00e7\u00f5es Geoqu\u00edmicas\n\nRESUMO\n\nCientistas usam simula\u00e7\u00f5es para entender fen\u00f4menos e processos complexos quando\neles s\u00e3o caros, dif\u00edceis e mesmo imposs\u00edveis de reproduzir da forma como ocorrem\nno mundo real.

and\nprocesses when they are expensive, difficult or even impossible to reproduce as they\noccur in the real world. Physical models for experimentation may be too expensive\nor difficult to reproduce, for example, when they require the construction of large\nand/or complex prototypes or buildings, or even landscapes. Such models might\nbe even impossible to build due to several conditions: for example, in nature, a\ngeological process takes thousands or millions of years to evolve, which of course is\nimpossible to reproduce in a life-time.\n\nSimulations are among the first scientific applications of computers, and also\namong the first motivations for the establishment of visualization as an important\nresearch area(MCCORMICK; DEFANTI; BROWN, 1987).\n\nWith the of increase of computational power along the years, simulations\nhave become more complex and longer, resulting in increasing volumes of data being\nproduced. The analysis of results of many simulation runs is a difficult task and has\nbeen motivating research on visualization throughout the years.\n\nA recent scenario related to visualization of simulation results is being tar-\ngeted by some researchers: the visualization of simulation ensembles. Simulation\nensembles are sets of simulations results, each simulation varying from each other\nin parameters settings, simulation models, or even different algorithms or numerical\nmethods. The complexity of such ensembles is due to the fact they are: (i) multidi-\nmensional, (ii) multivariate, (iii) time evolutive and (iv) multivalued (a variable in\na cell in a certain time is represented by many values, each value represented by its\nrespective simulation) (WILSON; POTTER, 2009).\n\n1.1 Motivation\n\nIn Geochemistry, scientists and researchers often want to study the inter-\naction between water (with solutes) and rocks, but realistic physical experiments\nmight no be possible in a feasible time, because these interactions take hundreds to\nmillion years to occur.\n\nSuch scenario is typical in the study of diagenetic processes. Diagenesis is\ndefined as the set of chemical, physical and biological changes through which the\n\n\n\n13\n\nsediments pass since their deposition, during and after lithification, and before the\nmetamorphic conditions. Diagenetic processes are controlled by factors such as\ntemperature, pressure, minerals, activity of the ions dissolved in water and organic\nsystems (ROS, 1996).\n\nIn order to perform such studies, they can use simulators that help them to\nunderstand what happened in the past to have the conditions a field presents in the\ncurrent days. However, they still lack the understanding of how the processes behave\nin different conditions, depending on temperature, pressure, and other boundary\nconditions.\n\nAnother problem geochemists face is that different simulators provide dif-\nferent answers to their questions, because of different approaches and different nu-\nmerical models they may use to give an answer. Thus, comparing these results also\nwould help scientists to better understand the natural processes they are simulating.\n\nThis scenario lead to the need of tools for the analysis of simulation ensem-\nbles, where a scientist could explore sets of simulation results, comparing results\nobtained under different conditions. Our research question is then: \"Would a set\nof interactive visualization techniques help researchers in understanding different\nresults in simulation ensembles?\"\n\n1.2 Objectives and Contribution\n\nThe main objective of this work is to propose and evaluate an interactive vi-\nsualization solution to help geochemists to analyze an ensemble or compare different\nensembles. Although the solution is devised to geochemical simulations, the overall\napproach can be used for other scenarios, such as climate and weather simulations\nand heat diffusion simulations, for example. We based our proposal in a systematic\nliterature review of visualization of ensembles data sets.\n\nThe main contribution of this work is the visualization solution itself, which\nallows a user to:\n\n\u2022 Customize the visualization of different aspects of the data to help users in\ntheir cognitive process of understanding the results of a simulation run, and\n\n\u2022 Build connected visualizations through a network of different views to allow\nthe comparison of different simulation ensembles.\n\n\n\n14\n\nA secondary contribution is the systematic literature review we performed\nprior to the design and development of our tool.\n\n1.3 Organization of the Dissertation\n\nThis dissertation is organized as follows:\n\n\u2022 Chapter 2 gives a short introduction to the problem domain that motivated\nour work and where we applied the proof-of-concept prototype.\n\n\u2022 Chapter 3 reviews the visualization solutions adopted by the most used simu-\nlators, and presents a systematic literature review on ensembles visualization.\n\n\u2022 Chapter 4 presents the rationale, design and implementation details about the\nsolution we propose for visualizing geochemical simulations ensembles.\n\n\u2022 Chapter 5 describes an hypothetical usage of our tool for analyzing results\nfrom simulations performed with hypothetical data by means of the provided\nvisualizations and associated interactive features.\n\n\u2022 Chapter 6 presents evaluation sessions conducted with 4 expert users, and\ndiscuss our findings from this evalution.\n\n\u2022 Chapter 7 concludes our work by discussing contribution and limitations, and\ndraws comments about future work.\n\n\n\n15\n\n2 BACKGROUND\n\nIn this section we shortly introduce diagenesis and geochemical modelling,\njust to provide the context that motivated the work, and where we applied our\nproof-of-concept prototype.\n\n2.1 Diagenetic processes\n\nAs mentioned before, diagenesis is the set of chemical, physical and biological\nchanges through which sediments pass until metamorphic rocks are formed. So, it\nimplies changes that occur since deposition, during and after a process known as\nlithification, and before the metamorphic conditions.\n\nDiagenetic processes are active, and the sedimentary minerals react to restore\nequilibrium in an environment where pressure, temperature and chemical composi-\ntion are changing. The reactions in the system can increase or decrease permeability\nand porosity (WORDEN; BURLEY, 2003). All these processes correspond to the\nformation of the present rocks, and they occurred along millions of years. A geologist\nstudying diagenesis usually wants to understand the processes that have occurred\nduring that time, as well as factors that may have influenced the oil quality of a\ndetermined region. So, simulations are run to test hypotheses about how an oil\nreservoir formed in the past, and ultimately, to determine its quality.\n\nUsually, geologists classify the stages of diagenesis as: Eodiagenesis, Meso-\ndiagenesis and Telodiagenesis. During Eodiagenesis, the depositional processes are\naffected by the proximity of the surface, and then they occur in low temperatures\nand depths. Mesodiagenesis is the stage in which the sediments and rocks are buried\nat depths that are not influenced by surface conditions, and thus occur in higher\ntemperatures. At last, Telodiagenesis is the stage where rocks are affected by pro-\ncesses associated to erosion and uplifts (ALI et al., 2010).\n\nSince diagenetic processes are influenced by temperature, pressure, minerals\nthat are present in the environment, activity of the ions dissolved in water and\norganic systems (ROS, 1996), they can be modelled as geochemical processes.\n\n\n\n16\n\n2.2 Geochemical Modeling\n\nGeochemical modeling typically refers to the process of describing the dis-\ntribution and reactivity of solutes in a given solution. Geochemical models can be\ndivided into two groups:\n\n\u2022 Geochemical Equilibrium Models, which are used under the assumption that\nthermodynamic equilibrium is reached in a relatively short time, so no time\nfactor is included in the calculation. They take into consideration only equi-\nlibrium reactions, and are considered batch models, which are basically closed\nvessels or reactors.\n\n\u2022 Geochemical Kinetic Models, that take into account kinetic reactions (besides\nequilibrium reactions) and include the time factor.\n\nGeochemical modelling is only useful as a forecasting tool if there is the\npossibility of validating the results. In real life, this is the goal that most often\nbecomes non-achievable, because of the complexity of natural systems, insufficient\nfield data and uncertainties related to how a system would change along time. A\nmodel must be treated as a simplification of reality, and its precision is dependent\non how it is capable of estimating the probability of a forecast to be true or false\n(NORDSTROM, 1992).\n\nThe first geochemical models date back to the 70\u2019s (WESTALL, 1976)(WOL-\nERY, 1979). Since then, these models have been used to solve complex geochemical\nproblems, such as speciation; determination of minerals\u2019 saturation indexes; mix-\ning of different waters; calculation of stoichiometric reactions; interaction between\nsolids, fluids and gaseous phases; calculation of equilibrium/kinetic controlled reac-\ntions; reactive transport; and mass-law calculations.\n\nThe quality of the results obtained from such a model depend on the methods\nused, and the thermodynamic data and theoretical concepts applied. Therefore,\nverifying the results is essential, and it is clear that there will be some differences\nbetween the results obtained from different software. Among the enormous variety of\nsoftware available, some of them are developed for batch-type simulations only, while\nothers have transport capabilities. Batch-type models are those where the spatial\ndomain is modelled as a single cell, where one can optionally have water on top of\nthe sediment. The existence of water allows modelling a surface condition, while a\n\n\n\n17\n\ncell with sediment only corresponds to a subsurface condition. On the other hand,\nmodels with transport conditions are used for simulating one-dimensional (1D), two-\ndimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) spatial domains. In these models, water\nflows through the domain cells contributing differently for the water-rock interaction\nprocesses.\n\nA general geochemical simulation process is roughly divided into 3 major\nstages: data input, simulation core and data output.\n\nData input consists of collecting information related to the geological medium\nof interest, through chemical analysis made in laboratory and through stratigraphic\nstudies on the sedimentary basin. These data are (i) water composition, (ii) mineral\ncomposition, (iii) kinetics and thermodynamics reactions, (iv) burial history (depth\nof rock formation, estimated time of the occurrence of lithology transformations,\npressure, temperature) and (v) spatial domain (batch in an one-cell domain, one-,\ntwo-, and three-dimensional domain). Data can be input through a script or filling\nin a form in a graphical user interface (GUI). Fig. 2.1 has a graphical description of\nthe user interacting with a simulation system.\n\nFigure 2.1: The framework execvuted by a geologist when describing its geochemical\nmodel in a computational system.\n\nData is entered to the simulation core, which starts the simulation execution\nsteps. In this stage, numerical methods are used to solve geochemical equations of\nfluid-rock interaction in the geological medium defined in the input data. As the\nsimulation process runs, system state is updated for each simulation step, and partial\nsimulation results are generated. This process goes on until the system reaches a\nsteady state or a user-defined maximum simulation time.\n\nData output is occurs at the end of each simulation step. The data generated\nby the simulation execution is stored in a file, usually text. Each simulator has its\n\n\n\n18\n\nown standard for input and output files.\nNext chapter revises visualizations provided by current, widely used geochem-\n\nical simulation software.\n\n\n\n19\n\n3 RELATED WORKS\n\n3.1 Visualizations of Geochemical Simulations\n\nWe researched in the literature to find works which have visualization of\ngeochemical simulations, but there was none. So we started to research the com-\nmercial softwares, and found two well-known simulators for geochemical modeling:\nGeochemist\u2019s Workbench (GWB)1 and Toughreact 2.\n\nIn GWB, the user sets an initial geochemical system to be taken to thermody-\nnamic equilibrium. The software automatically inserts a known volume of water in\nthe system (1 kg). Then, the user sets the amounts of solutes present in that water.\nGWB starts the calculations and the necessary iterations that lead to a speciation\nmodel. 3\n\nWhen GWB finishes the simulation, output data is generated. Data contained\nin the output file are temperature, pressure, pH, ionic strength, water activity, mass\nof solvent, dissolved solids, solution density and mass of the rock. A list of aqueous\nspecies is also output with all solutes present in the model. An important indicator is\nthe \u201cSaturation Index \u2013 SI\u201d of the fluid, which informs if: (i) mineral and solution are\nin equilibrium; (ii) solution is super-saturated; or (iii) solution is under-saturated.\n\nToughreact can be used in one-, two-, or three-dimensional geological domains\nin heterogeneous physical and chemical environments, i.e., a wide range of condi-\ntions. Input files are provided through a GUI (PetraSim). Firstly, the user selects\nthe solutes that will compose the aqueous phase, and then selects the lithology of\ninterest describing the geological environment. Kinetics and thermodynamic param-\neters are adjusted after the user builds the interaction model. Once all requirements\nare satisfied, the software starts the simulation.\n\nToughreact output data is generated basically to provide plots of the quan-\ntity of solute and volume variation versus simulation time. If the user wants to\nvisualize saturation index, Toughreact generates text files that need to be exported\nas spreadsheets, like EXCEL.\n\nAs for visualization, GWB provides the tool named Gtplot that allows users\n\n1<http://www.gwb.com/>\n2<http://www.thunderheadeng.com/petrasim/>\n3A geochemical speciation modeling software calculates the distribution of dissolved species\n\nbetween free ions and aqueous complexes and also saturation indexes for different minerals.\n\nhttp://www.gwb.com/\nhttp://www.thunderheadeng.com/petrasim/\n\n\n20\n\nto display simulation results with 2D visualization techniques, such as line plots, pie\ncharts, color maps, contour plots, vector plots and star plots. However, regarding\ndiagenesis, only line plots are used.\n\nRegarding Thoughreact output, PetraSim provides more visualization tech-\nniques like line plots, 3D iso-surface visualization, vector and 3D contour plots.\n\nBoth GWB and Thorughreact, however, do not support visualization of more\nthan one simulation run results. If the user wants to compare simulations output,\nhe/she must manually combine the plots generated by each simulation.\n\n3.1.1 DiagenViz\n\nIn a previous work, we developed a visualization tool called DiagenViz, for dis-\nplaying results within the context of a diagenetic process modeling project (FELLER,\n2014) (FELLER; KLUNK; FREITAS, 2015).\n\nDiagenViz is implemented in C++, using the Qt Framework 4 for the GUI\nand two external libraries for visualization: QCustomPlot 5 for the 2D plots, and\nQwtPlot3D 6 for 3D plots. The GUI is divided into two panels: the visualization\npanel and the variable selection panel (see Fig. 3.1).\n\nThe variable selection panel is divided in three main parts : (A) variable\nselection itself, (B) axis selection and (C) time and/or cell selection.\n\nIn (A), the user selects the variable that he wants to analyze. A tree widget\nis used to select a species or a variable to be analyzed, depending on what the user\nwants to focus. In (B), the user selects the variable to be represented in each axis.\nBy default, the plot will have at least one variable (time), but it may also have\ndistances, depending of the dimension of the domain. Also, when the user selects\none of the default variables for one of the axis, its list will fade out from (B), because\nit will be plotted. In (C), the user defines which time step or cells in the domain\nshe/he wants to visualize, and this combines all selected cells and time steps the\nuser has selected.\n\nAs an option, after setting (C), the user can define if the data on a specific\naxis is in linear scale or logarithmic scale. Also, the user can filter the data he/she\n\n4<https://www.qt.io/>\n5<http://www.qcustomplot.com/>\n6<https://github.com/sintegrial/qwtplot3d>\n\nhttps://www.qt.io/\nhttp://www.qcustomplot.com/\nhttps://github.com/sintegrial/qwtplot3d\n\n\n21\n\nFigure 3.1: DiagenViz UI: left part is the variable selection panel and right part is\nthe visualization panel.\n\nwants to visualize, selecting the interval of values to be plotted.\nThe visualization panel plots the variables chosen by the user. The visual-\n\nization techniques provided by the tool were chosen based on user preference. The\nusers of DiagenViz were the geologists that interacted constantly with the simulator\ndevelopment team. The techniques are quite simple in terms of visualization, but\nthey are based on the techniques that geologists were used to: (i) line plots, (ii) line\nplots with two Y axes, (iii) scatterplots and (iv) 3D surface plots. Line plots are\nused when one of the variables is continuous, i.e time or distance. Line plots with\ntwo Y axes are used when the user selects two different types of variables for the Y\naxis, e.g saturation and volume fraction, and X axis depicts a continuous variable.\nScatterplots are used when the user wants to compare two non-continuous variables,\nto analyze their relation, e.g concentration of Ca++ and Calcite saturation. 3D sur-\nface plots (Fig. 3.2) are used when the user wants to analyze the variation of one\nvariable in relation to two others, as for example, Quartz saturation per time and\ndistance. For all the techniques, we also implemented animation to allow display of\nthe plots along the simulation time (the animation controls are at the top of each\nplot).\n\n\n\n22\n\nFigure 3.2: Example of a three-dimensional plot, showing Albite volume fraction by\ntime and distance.\n\nTwo users evaluated DiagenViz based on the comparison between GWB, Pe-\ntrasim and DiagenViz. One of them (User1) being a young specialist in geochemistry\nthat frequently uses GWB and Petrasim/Toughreact for his research, and the other\n(User2) a senior specialist in geochemistry that does not use any of these tools, since\nhe has developed his own simulator.\n\nIn general, PetraSim got the worst results in most of the aspects. Both\nusers complained about the limitation of the plots in PetraSim, because they could\nonly visualize solute concentration and mineral volume fraction, but not saturation\nindex, which is one of the most important variables for diagenesis studies. Two good\npoints noticed by User2 about PetraSim are the speed and simplicity in plotting the\navailable variables, even it is not complete. Another drawback was catched by both\nusers: PetraSim does not give to users ways to explore data. This may result from\nthe lack of variables to be shown.\n\nIn comparing GWB and DiagenViz, both users did not show a consensus as\nin PetraSim. We noticed that the young specialist preferred DiagenViz rather than\nGWB, but as for the senior specialist, DiagenViz and GWB were similar, but GWB\n\n\n\n23\n\nwas found better than DiagenViz in some concepts.\nFrom this previous work, we kept the idea of allowing the user to interactively\n\nchoose which variables were to be mapped to which visual dimension, mainly because\nthe simulator for which we developed the proof-of-concept provides hundreds of\nvariables for each simulation step, and is up to the user to choose which one is\nimportant to use as a comparison among the members f a ensemble simulation.\n\n3.2 Visualization of Ensemble Simulations\n\nIn this section, we review related work on visualization of ensemble simula-\ntions. We followed a systematic review protocol, with selected research questions,\nand obtained an overview of selected articles, which allowed for design decisions in\nour work.\n\n3.2.1 Systematic Review\n\nA systematic review was conducted with the following objectives:\n\n\u2022 To identify which visual representations are used in different scientific domains\nfor the visualization of ensemble data sets.\n\n\u2022 To verify which interactive visualization tasks are important.\n\n\u2022 To identify which scientific domains use visualization techniques for presenting\nresults from multiple simulation runs.\n\nWe followed the guidelines for systematic literature review (SLR) provided\nby Kitchenham and Charters (KITCHENHAM; CHARTERS, 2007). Although they\nwere published as guidelines for reviews in software engineering, they are general\nenough for our purposes. We also based our review in the results published by other\nSLR in visualization for different problems (SHAHIN; LIANG; BABAR, 2014)(NO-\nVAIS et al., 2013)(YUSOFF; SALIM, 2015)(CARROLL et al., 2014).\n\n\n\n24\n\n3.2.2 Systematic Literature Review Protocol\n\nThe protocol of SLR dictates five aspects to be defined before searching for\narticles: (i) research questions, (ii) search method, (iii) inclusion and exclusion\ncriteria, (iv) filtering options and (v) data to be extracted from each article.\n\n3.2.2.1 Research Questions\n\nWe have formulated 6 questions, which are shown in Table 3.1 along the\nmotivation for each one.\n\nTable 3.1: Research Questions\nResearch Question Motivation\nRQ1: What are the visualization tech-\nniques implemented for ensemble data\nsets visualization?\n\nTo understand what matters to sci-\nentists when they visualize ensembles\nof simulation results and to get an\noverview of the visual metaphors used.\n\nRQ2: Which research areas use visual-\nization of ensemble data sets?\n\nTo identify which research areas deals\nmostly with simulation ensembles.\n\nRQ3: What is the relation between vi-\nsualization techniques and research do-\nmains?\n\nTo understand what visualization tech-\nniques and visual metaphors are used\nby each research area.\n\nRQ4: What are the visualization tasks\nused in ensemble data sets visualiza-\ntion?\n\nTo investigate how scientists interact\nwith visualization techniques.\n\nRQ5: What kind of analyses are used\nin ensemble data sets visualization?\n\nTo investigate what kinds of algorithms\nare used in the analysis of an ensemble.\n\nRQ6: Are coordinated multiple views\n(CMV) used in most of the works?\n\nObserve the potential use of such views\nin a future implementation of a system\nfor visualizing ensemble data sets.\n\nOur main objective can be achieved by answering three questions (RQ1, RQ2\nand RQ3). RQ1 is directed towards knowing the visualization techniques used in\nall the articles, and provides an overview of what is important to scientists of all\nresearch areas. RQ2 looks for the research areas addressed by the articles found, so\nit can help to identify which areas can be explored in future research. Answers to\nRQ3 allow to correlate the visualization techniques with the research area to have a\nmore complete analysis of how visualization techniques are used and who use them.\n\n\n\n25\n\nRQ4 can help in understanding how the scientists interact with a visualization\nsystem, if they prefer to interact with the visualization itself or through widgets\nin a graphical user interface. This may eventually help designers of visualization\ntechniques for simulation systems.\n\nRQ5, like RQ4, is a question focused on the user, but it focuses more on\nthe analytical process, i.e., more on the perception side, while RQ4 is more focused\non the action side (SACHA et al., 2016). Discovering how a user behaves trying to\nunderstand the data, and what algorithms are used in the analysis are also important\nfor designing a visualization tool.\n\nRQ6 also will address how users prefer to observe and interact their results:\nall data summarized in one visualization technique or through different visualization\ntechniques.\n\nThe answers for all these questions will help designers to start understanding\nhow scientists prefer to visualize their simulation results, and how they prefer to\ninteract with the visualization techniques.\n\n3.2.2.2 Search method and data sources\n\nAt first, we performed a manual search to collect some of the most relevant\nworks, which allowed us to elaborate the review protocol. Then, an automatic search\nstrategy was used in the following data sources: (i) IEEE Xplore7, (ii) ACM Digital\nLibrary8, (iii) ScienceDirect9, (iv) SpringerLink10 and (v) Wiley Online Library11.\nIn all of them, except for SpringerLink, we matched the search terms with title,\nkeywords or abstract, while in SpringerLink we had to match with the full-text. We\ndid not include Google Scholar because, besides it produces low precision (and many\nirrelevant) results, it has a considerable overlap with the used data sources, creating\nan unnecessary effort. Different for other sources, in Springer, we could not filter\nthrough meta-data, so our query was used in full-text only for this case.\n\nWe used the strategies listed in Kitchenham guide to formulate the search\nquery (KITCHENHAM; CHARTERS, 2007). As major terms of the search we\nidentified \"visualization\", \"ensemble\" and \"simulation\". The resulting query was the\n\n7<http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp>\n8<http://dl.acm.org>\n9<http://www.sciencedirect.com>\n\n10<http://link.springer.com>\n11<http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com>\n\nhttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp\nhttp://dl.acm.org\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com\nhttp://link.springer.com\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com\n\n\n26\n\nfollowing:\n(visualization OR visualisation OR visual) AND ensemble AND (simula-\n\ntion OR simulations)\nWe searched the data sources looking for the literature published from 2009\n\nuntil January 2017. We started from 2009 because it was in that year that Wilson\nand Potter study of ensemble data sets defined visualization of multiple runs of\nsimulations as a research problem (WILSON; POTTER, 2009).\n\n3.2.2.3 Inclusion and exclusion criteria\n\nThe main purpose of inclusion and exclusion criteria is to select relevant\nworks that help answer questions in a systematic literature review. In our SLR, the\ninclusion criteria are:\n\n1. Article revised and available in text format.\n\n2. Article introduces a visualization technique or a visualization system to visu-\nalize ensemble data sets.\n\nThe exclusion criteria are:\n\n1. Editorials, abstracts, posters and tutorials.\n\n2. Not written in English.\n\n3. Visualization of simulations that do not produce ensemble data sets.\n\n4. Duplicated works.\n\n3.2.2.4 Data Extraction\n\nFor each paper in a SLR study one needs to extract relevant data. Table\n3.2 shows the data items extracted for each article along with their description.\nD1 to D4 are items for an overview study and are recommended by Kitchenham\nand Charters (KITCHENHAM; CHARTERS, 2007). D5 to D9 are related to our\nresearch questions, with D5 to D8 being categorical data and D9, a Boolean answer,\n\"yes\" or \"no\". D5 was extracted to answer RQ1 and to help answering RQ3; D6 is\nrelated to RQ4, D7 with RQ2 and, with D5, we covered RQ3, while D8 is related to\nRQ5 and D9 to RQ6.\n\n\n\n27\n\nTable 3.2: Data fields extracted\nData item Description\nD1: Author The author(s) of the paper\nD2: Year The year of paper publication\nD3: Title The title of the paper\nD4: Event The venue or event where the paper was pub-\n\nlished\nD5: Visualization technique(s) The visualization technique(s) used in the\n\npaper\nD6: Interaction technique(s) The interaction feature(s) present in the vi-\n\nsualization technique(s)\nD7: Research area(s) The research area(s) where the visualization\n\ntechnique(s) was(were) appliedied\nD8: Analysis technique(s) The automated analysis technique(s) used to\n\nhelp in user analysis\nD9: Use of CMV If the work uses coordinated multiple views\n\n3.2.2.5 Study selection\n\nWe divided the study selection in stages. In the first stage using the query\nin all data sources we found a total of 3,771 articles. In a second stage, filtering by\nreading the publication title and keywords, we selected 69 articles. The third stage\nof filtering was based on reading the abstract: we selected 52 articles. In the fourth\nstage we read the articles, and we selected a total of 39 articles. With these 39\nworks, we took their references and applied a similar process to extrapolate, trying\nto reach works we could not get with the query. Applying the same process, we\nselected 12 more articles, and then we ended up with a total of 51 papers.\n\n3.2.3 SLR Results\n\nIn this section we present the results of the analysis of the 51 selected papers.\nAll the selected papers are cited Tables A.1 and A.2.\n\nAt first, we analyze data about the evolution of the publications of ensemble\ndata sets visualization along the years. After, we report answers to our research\nquestions (listed in section 3.2.2.1), starting with answers for RQ2 in Section 3.2.3.2.\nThen, RQ1 and RQ3 will be discussed in Section 3.2.3.3. In Section 3.2.3.4, we\ndiscussed results regarding RQ4, while in Section 3.2.3.5 we address RQ5. Finally,\nSection 3.2.3.6 reports our results regarding RQ6.\n\n\n\n28\n\n3.2.3.1 Evolution of the amount of published articles\n\nFigure 3.3: Publications per year\n\nFigure 3.3 shows the quantity of published works per year. We can notice a\nsteady evolution of published works from 2011 to 2013, and it remained stable from\n2013 to 2016, with 2014 being an exception. Since we stopped our survey in August\n2017, it is likely that the number of published papers remain stable, confirming that\nthe subject still has open questions to be addressed.\n\n3.2.3.2 Research areas\n\nTable 3.3: Research areas and specific problems addressed in the papers\nResearch area Problem/main subject of papers\nAstronomy Study of celestial objects and their processes\nBiology Study of living organisms\n\nChemistry Study of matter composition, structure, properties\nand changes\n\nEngineering Application of scientific principles to design and/or\ndevelop structures, machines and apparatus\n\nEarth Sciences Study of Earth and its composition, structure,\nphysical properties and processes\n\nPhysics Study of nature and its phenomena\n\nTo answer RQ2 (\"Which research areas use visualization of ensemble data\nsets?\") and to help answering RQ3 (\"What is the relation between visualization\n\n\n\n29\n\nFigure 3.4: Quantity of papers per research area\n\ntechniques and research domains?\"), we first need to classify the selected studies\naccording to the research area and the visualization techniques they use.\n\nWe observed that many of the selected papers aimed at helping researchers\nfrom different scientific areas. Then, the best approach was to classify them based\non academic disciplines. We chose the academic disciplines as enumerated by Bates\n(BATES, 2007), and we excluded the categories that do not deal with numerical\nsimulations, since this is the context of our work.\n\nIn Table 3.3 we list the research areas categories and their definition that\nhelped us to classify the selected articles. There is a paper that belongs to more\nthan one category because the use case is from an intersection of areas (XIAO et\nal., 2015). Another consideration is that some papers have multiple use cases for\nvalidating their visualizations (MIRZARGAR; WHITAKER; KIRBY, 2014). The\nresults of this classification is shown in Fig. 3.4.\n\nEarth Sciences is the research area where we found most application of visu-\nalization techniques for ensemble data sets. Within this domain, the research field\nthat shows the majority of use cases is climate and weather simulations, followed by\nocean simulations. One aspect we noticed in the articles about climate and weather\nis that they choose mainly two sources of data: (i) Weather Research and Forecast-\ning (WRF) Model12 and (ii) Goddard Earth Observing System, Version 5 (GEOS-5)\n\n12<http://www.wrf-model.org>\n\nhttp://www.wrf-model.org\n\n\n30\n\n13.\nThe second main research area is Physics. Fluid dynamics is the most used\n\nexample, followed by heavy ion collisions. Different from Earth Sciences data, fluid\ndynamics simulation data do not come from known data sources, so they are likely\nto originate from self-developed simulators or from partners.\n\nThe third significant research area we found is Engineering, which of course\nis a wide discipline, encompassing several research fields. Most of the works are\nvisualization of simulations of car engines, followed by flooding in cities.\n\nSummarizing the findings related to RQ2, the research areas with most usage\nof visualization of ensemble data sets are Earth Sciences, with 54.4% of the selected\nworks, Physics, 31,6%, and Engineering, 22,8%.\n\n3.2.3.3 Visualization techniques\n\nTable 3.4: Visualization techniques categories\nVisualization technique Definition\n\nSpatial Techniques for visualizing data associated to\na spatial domain often in real world\n\nTemporal Techniques for visualizing the evolution of\ndata along time\n\nMultivariate Techniques for visualizing values of two or\nmore different data features\n\nUncertainty Techniques using a visual metaphor for rep-\nresenting an aggregation of values\n\nClassifying visualization techniques is a hard task, because there are many\naspects to take in consideration. Techniques are usually classified according to the\ndata it aims to present (CHI, 2000)(SHNEIDERMAN, 1996)(TORY; MOLLER,\n2004)(MUNZNER, 2014). This is the most common way of classifying techniques\nbecause researchers want to understand the whole structure of the data to make\ntheir assumptions. This type of classification is said to be a low-level taxonomy\n(TORY; MOLLER, 2004), but the problem is that it just considers the researcher\nside, and users have different ideas about visualization (CHENGZHI; CHENGHU;\nTAO, 2003).\n\nOther way to define taxonomies for visualization techniques is to create spe-\ncific classifications (PRICE; BAECKER; SMALL, 1993)(WENZEL; BERNHARD;\nJESSEN, 2003)(LIP[Pleaseinsertintopreamble]A et al., 2012)(KEHRER; HAUSER,\n\n13<https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/GEOS/>\n\nhttps://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/GEOS/\n\n\n31\n\nFigure 3.5: Quantity of papers employing each visualization technique\n\n2013). It is easier to solve a taxonomy problem for a specific case than building a\nmore general taxonomy. Moreover, since it limits problems, such taxonomy may con-\nsider other aspects, e.g., visual metaphors, dimensions of the graphical representa-\ntion, analysis techniques, etc. (WENZEL; BERNHARD; JESSEN, 2003)(KEHRER;\nHAUSER, 2013). The disadvantage of specific taxonomies is the difficulty to ex-\ntrapolate from a domain to another, since this other domain will have its specific\nproblems, which can not be dealt with using taxonomies from other domains.\n\nTo classify the selected studies we used a mixture of both approaches. The\ncategories were based on data because all the visualization techniques we are deal-\ning with are for scientific research, so the users, i.e., researchers, are more concerned\nabout understanding the results of their simulations, so they know how the data\nis structured and what they want to visualize. Another consideration is that the\ndefinition of ensemble data sets is already associated to data types (i.e., multidimen-\nsional, time evolutive, multivariable and multivalued), so we brought this definition\nfor our categories. Table 3.4 describes the categories of visualization techniques we\nused and how they should be interpreted.\n\nIn Fig. 3.5 one can observe the dominance of spatial visualization techniques,\nas 2-dimensional maps and 3-dimensional volumes, being reported in 89.5% of the\nstudies. The second most used visualization techniques category is uncertainty visu-\nalization techniques, in 73.7% of the studies. Color is the most used visual attribute,\n\n\n\n32\n\nbeing employed to represent statistical values, followed by different kinds of box\nplots (WHITAKER; MIRZARGAR; KIRBY, 2013)(MIRZARGAR; WHITAKER;\nKIRBY, 2014). Then, we observed temporal visualization techniques, mainly rep-\nresented by line charts, in 45.6% of the studies. This is a natural finding because\nsimulation produces data along time. At last, we observe several works employing\nmultivariate techniques (38.6% of the studies), mainly scatter plots and parallel co-\nordinates. The results showed the importance of visualizing data associated to the\nsimulation domain in an aggregated way, so the users can obtain at first an overview\nof the behavior of certain variables over the domain space.\n\nWe have also analyzed the visualization techniques of the three most im-\nportant research areas to answer RQ3 (\"What is the relation among visualization\ntechniques and research domains?\"). Then, we combined the classification of visu-\nalization techniques with research areas, and the results are shown in Fig.3.6.\n\nOne can notice that in Earth Sciences all the studies use some real world space\nreference, and it is mainly due to the definition of the research area itself. All the\nstudies use some spatial visualization technique, and we found that 2-dimensional\nmaps are the most frequently used visual representation in these studies. Another\nconsideration is the large amount of studies that employ some uncertainty technique\n(92.6% of the works), mainly due to the need of predicting some phenomenon. We\nwere not expecting so rare use of temporal visualization techniques, only 37% of the\nstudies employed some technique of this category.\n\nRegarding Physics, it is almost the same scenario as for Earth Sciences. 93.3%\nof the studies use some spatial visualization technique, mainly due to the fact that\nin the most used cases (fluid dynamics) it is necessary to visualize how the matter\nbehaves in real world. The main difference, when compared to Earth Sciences, is\nthe use of uncertainty visualization techniques in 60% of the studies.\n\nEngineering is a different scenario, where we found a more distributed use of\ndifferent visualization techniques. 69.2% of the articles report the use of multivariate\nvisualization techniques, like scatter plots and parallel coordinates. In 61.5% of the\nstudies, spatial and temporal visualization techniques are used, and uncertainty\nvisualization being least used, in 50% of the articles. As mentioned before, different\nengineering research fields imply simulations for different problems, involving diverse\ndata sets, rising the need for different techniques.\n\nFinally, we can comment on results for answering RQ1 and RQ3. As for RQ1\n\n\n\n33\n\nFigure 3.6: Visualization techniques usage in each research area\n\n(\"What are the visualization techniques implemented for ensemble data sets visual-\nization?\"), usually spatial and uncertainty visualization techniques are the most im-\nportant, but since it is always necessary to understand the needs of researchers, it is\nlikely to assume that the other two techniques are necessary as well. To answer RQ3\n(\"What is the relation between visualization techniques and research domains?\"), we\nfound that in Earth Sciences and Physics the most used visualization techniques are\nspatial and uncertainty techniques, while in Engineering all four visualization kinds\nof visualization techniques are used.\n\n3.2.3.4 Visualization tasks\n\nThe study of how users interact with visualizations is important to improve\nthe usability of the visualization techniques and helping users to increase their ca-\npacity of creating more hypothesis (SACHA et al., 2016) and investigating them.\n\nThere is a large number of studies classifying user tasks (SHNEIDERMAN,\n1996)(KEHRER; HAUSER, 2013)(YI et al., 2007)(KEIM, 2002). We can describe\nthe way users interact with a visualization using the well-known mantra, \"Overview\nfirst, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand\" (SHNEIDERMAN, 1996). This\nmantra introduced a user interface visualization strategy that researchers call Overview\n+ detail. Another visualization strategy is Focus + context, where the overview\n(context) and the details (focus) are viewed simultaneously (CARD; MACKINLAY;\nSHNEIDERMAN, 1999), with the user changing the focus in some interactive way,\ne.g. fish-eye (FURNAS, 1986). Both of these interaction approaches can be used in\n\n\n\n34\n\nthe visualization of ensemble data sets.\nTo classify the selected studies by the tasks the user performs within a visual-\n\nization system, we used Brehmer and Munzner typology (BREHMER; MUNZNER,\n2013), because, besides being a classification based on previous ones, they use it\nto help in describing tasks of known visualization tools. Since we want to classify\nuser interactions within a visualization system, we are using most of the \"how?\"\ntechniques observed by them.\n\nThe list of techniques we used to classify the selected studies by their inter-\naction features is shown in Table 3.5. The other categories described by Brehmer\nand Munzner were not found in the selected studies. We should also state that we\nclassified the techniques by what was explicitly described in the articles, implicit\ninteractions were not considered. For example, zooming and rotation, which are\npart of the \"navigate\" category, can be implicit for a 3-dimensional visualization,\nbut they were only considered if they are referred to in the text.\n\nTable 3.5: Visualization task categories\nVisualization interactive task Definition\n\nSelect Selection of elements\nNavigate Alter user viewpoint\nArrange Organizing elements\nChange Alter visual encoding\nFilter Adjust exclusion and inclusion\n\ncriteria\nAggregate Change granularity\n\nIn 36 studies, representing 70.6%, we found interactive techniques thus show-\ning the importance of interaction in visualization systems.\n\nIn Fig. 3.7 we present the quantity of studies addressing each interaction\ntechnique: 97.2% of the studies which used some interaction used \"select\" opera-\ntions to \"select ensemble members\" or some point or area in a map. In 91.7% of\nthe papers, authors report the changing of the visual encode, which is used most to\nhighlight selected items. In 58.3% of the articles, filtering is used, being brushing\nthe most used filtering technique. Interaction techniques for navigation were used\nin 41.7% of the works, being zooming techniques used in some 2-dimensional graph-\nics and necessary in 3-dimensional visualizations. Arrange is one of the less used\ntechnique due to the few studies using clustering and aggregate (DEMIR; DICK;\nWESTERMANN, 2014). The user orders to change the granularity of the domain\nusing a semantic zoom, the other do not change granularity, they just do a real\n\n\n\n35\n\nzoom.\n\nFigure 3.7: Quantity of papers employing each visualization task\n\nRegarding RQ4, selecting is important because the user usually needs to\nselect the ensemble members to perform some other tasks; change allows to modify\nthe visual encoding to highlight the selected members so the users are kept oriented\nwithin the ensemble; filtering is used the lower the data items the scientist wants\nto visualize, by brushing or by some other parameter definition, and navigate is\nimportant for exploring 3-dimensional domains.\n\n3.2.3.5 Analysis techniques\n\nWhen dealing with ensemble data sets, users often face the need of analyzing\nmultivalued data (WILSON; POTTER, 2009), which is difficult to analyze for each\nensemble member at the same time. To overcome this problem some techniques\naggregate data so fewer values or relations among data values are easier to represent\nand understand.\n\nTable 3.6 presents the categories we use for describing the different analysis\ntechniques we found being employed by the surveyed studies. There are other clas-\nsifications for analysis techniques (KEHRER; HAUSER, 2013)(FEW, 2009), but we\nneeded a broader way to classify the selected studies, since we wanted to consider\nanalysis techniques ranging from descriptive statistics and Principal Component\n\n\n\n36\n\nAnalysis (PCA), for example, to clustering and neural networks.\n\nTable 3.6: Analysis techniques categories\nAnalysis technique Definition\n\nStatistics Inputs a list of values, outputs one or more\nvalues resulting from a function or procedure\n\nDimensionality reduction Inputs a multidimensional data set, outputs\na reduced-dimension data set that can be\nplotted in 2D or 3D\n\nData Mining Inputs a data set, outputs relations resulting\nfrom a deterministic function\n\nMachine Learning Inputs a data set, outputs a result from a\nnon-deterministic function\n\nWe considered a study as belonging to the category of statistics if the study\nuses a method which receives a list of values, executes a function that calculates\none or more values, and the formulas employed in the calculation do not change.\nAn example of such statistics is the quartile trend chart (POTTER et al., 2009).\nRegarding dimensionality reduction techniques we considered them as methods that\nreceive a list of data comprising many attributes for each data item, execute some\nfunction which, in the end, will help to understand correlation and similarity of the\ndata items. Common examples of dimensionality reduction techniques are Principal\nComponents Analysis (PCA) and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). As for the data\nmining category, given a set of data items, the technique returns some more complex\nrelations between the data items. Clustering is the most used example of data mining\ntechnique in visualization. Finally, regarding machine learning techniques the input\nis some data (it can be one item or a list of items), and the output is some other\ndata (it can be a complex relation, as data mining) and this data can change how\nthe function evaluates further input data, with the possibility of processing previous\ndata yielding different results.\n\nFig. 3.8 is the distribution of the analysis techniques among the 51 selected\nstudies. Eleven studies did not fit in any of our categories, because they were based\njust on observations. Considering the 40 studies that fitted in the categories, 95%\nuse statistics and the other techniques are used in 25% or less the cases.\n\nSo, answering RQ5 (\"What kind of analyses are used in ensemble data sets\nvisualization?\"), the use of statistics in the visualization seems the most common\napproach used to help researchers in their analysis. This may change with the more\noften use of visual analytics techniques with ensemble data sets.\n\n\n\n37\n\nFigure 3.8: Quantity of papers with each analysis technique\n\n3.2.3.6 Coordinated multiple views\n\nCoordinated Multiple Views (CMV) is an approach for exploratory visual-\nization used to investigate data (usually a large volume of data) by means of dif-\nferent, coordinated representations (BALDONADO; WOODRUFF; KUCHINSKY,\n2000)(ROBERTS, 2007). The advantages of using CMV are the discovery of rela-\ntionships that can be hard or impossible to visualize with a single visualization. It\nis said to improve user cognition in finding the data he/she wants, since each view\nintends to improve the understanding of different aspects of the data. However, it\nis still rarely used in commercial systems, being employed more often in academic\nresearch (ANDRIENKO; ANDRIENKO, 2007).\n\nWe used the CMV definition to classify the selected studies: they were clas-\nsified as \"Yes\" if they use CMV, or \"No\" if they did not. In 64.7% of the cases, CMV\nis used, while in 35.3% it is not.\n\nSo, related to RQ6 (\"Is coordinated multiple views (CMV) used in most of\nthe works?\"), yes, CMV is used in most of the studies, proving its importance to\nusers. Many of the studies that do not use CMV, have as objective to visualize\nspatial data or a specific aspect in one visualization.\n\n3.2.4 Further Comments\n\nWe investigated how researchers design systems to explore this type of data,\nconsidering what is important to visualize for the most used research areas, how the\n\n\n\n38\n\nusers interact with the system and how they visualize the relations or values in the\nvisualization. It is aimed at helping researchers to design systems and to develop\nother ways for exploring ensemble data sets.\n\nUnfortunately, this study has also some threats to validity (in a SLR, we have\nto point out the threats to validity of the employed method and results). We think\nthe human decision bias is the biggest threat, because it comes in the every stage\nof this study, from selecting the studies to classifying the remaining ones. To try\nto mitigate the problem in the selection of the studies we extrapolated using the\nreferences sections of articles selected in the automatic research. However, it still\nbrings bias which can interfere in the result, but it was lowered. Other biases we\nare aware of were the fatigue in selecting the studies from the automatic search due\nto the large quantity of papers found (3,771).\n\nWe observed that using multidimensional visualization techniques is most\nimportant in many areas, but the use of other techniques can be important as well.\nSo, before designing new techniques, the researcher still needs to consult the users\nabout what they want to explore in the data. We also identified the intense use\nof interaction techniques and CMV in the visualization of different aspects of the\ndata as an important solution. And how researchers use analysis techniques was\nalso presented, with the majority using statistics, but we think the other techniques\ncan be more explored to help the users to understand more aspects of the data.\n\n\n\n39\n\n4 GEOCHEMICAL SIMULATION ENSEMBLES VISUALIZATION\n\nIn this chapter we present the design and implementation of GEVis, a system\nwhich objective is to help geologists in exploring data from ensembles of geochem-\nical simulations. Although our approach aims at being general for any simulation\nensembles, the proof-of-concept prototype we built considers data output from a\ngeochemical simulator used in a current project at UFRGS.\n\nAt a certain extent we follow the \"What-Why-How\" framework used by\n(MUNZNER, 2014). Firstly, we describe the data coming from the simulator our\nusers adopted, and then we present the users\u2019 tasks that we targeted in our work.\nThen we describe the GEVis architecture and the visualization techniques we pro-\nvided along implementation details.\n\nAlso we are using our experience in designing visualization systems for ge-\nologists with what was found in the SLR (in Section 3.2.1) to design our system.\nWe tried to use all visualization techniques described in the SLR (Section 3.2.3.3)\nto give the user different views about the data and used all interactive tasks, but\nAggregate (Section 3.2.3.4) to give the user alternatives to interact with its data\n(even some of the techniques are not used much).\n\n4.1 Data Description and Users\u2019 Tasks\n\nBefore start the work, we need to understand how the data is disposed and\nwhat the users want to visualize in their desired visualization system. So first we\ndescribe the data format provided by the simulator specified in section 2.2, then we\ndescribe the user desired tasks in the system.\n\n4.1.1 Data Description\n\nThe data our tool takes for visualization is the output from geochemical\nsimulator. It comes as two files for each simulation: a header file that contains the\ndescription of the variables in the output, also containing the summary of each time\nstep, (Fig. 4.1 and a data file that contains the values of the variables defined in the\nheader file for each time step and each cell (Fig. 4.2. Each variable in the header\n\n\n\n40\n\nfile is defined as a composition of textual information (Fig. 4.1a).\n\nFigure 4.1: Header file example\n\n(a) Variable information in the header file. (b) Time steps information in the header file.\n\nThere are five possible types of variables depending on to what entities they\nrefer to: (i) sediment, (ii) water column, (iii) element, (iv) solute and (v) solid. The\nSediment type variables are related to the sediment itself as porosity, temperature,\nwater velocity, and so on, being the only species of the type. Water column variables\nare only available if the simulation uses evaporation methods. Element variables\nare about some information of the quantity of each chemical element present in the\nrelated cell. Solute variables represent solute concentration in the water and activity\nin reactions, and each solute present in the system is defined in the data input, as H+\n\n(representing pH), HCO \u20133 , etc. Solid variables are related to minerals(e.g. Quartz\nand Calcite), they present precipitation and dissolution, saturation, volume fraction\nand mineralization rate for each mineral.\n\nAlso in the header file there is a short description of all time steps, telling\nthe quantity of cells in each dimension, the number of variables, the time in years of\nthe time step and clock information the time step was calculated (Fig. 4.1b). This\nhelps in the code allocate the data structures to save the values.\n\nThe actual data is in the data file (Fig. 4.2), where each time step is separated\nby a tag FORMAT, with the data of the current time of the time step and the time\n\n\n\n41\n\nFigure 4.2: Data file showing data values from two time steps.\n\nthe simulation is going to end. The next row begins with a tag SEGMENT which\nis equal to the rows in the header file describing the summary of the time step. The\nfollowing rows until the next FORMAT tag is the data of each variable described\nin the header file for each domain cell. The first three values represent the distance\nof the cell from the domain origin, and the next values represent the data of the\nvariables, described in the order they appear in the header file.\n\nUsing Munzner\u2019s classification (MUNZNER, 2014), the output data is a Field,\nbecause the variables (described in the header file) are associated to each cell at each\ntime step. Variables associated with distance or time are considered continuous data,\nand variables associated to another variable is non-continuous.\n\n4.1.2 Motivating Users\u2019 Tasks\n\nTo define what typical users would want to visualize from sets of geochemical\nsimulation results, and the tasks they would need to perform with these data, we\ninterviewed two geologists. Both are users of the geochemical simulator mentioned in\nthe previous section. We conducted informal interviews with these users to find out\nwhat would be their intentions to use a visualization system to visualize ensemble\ndata set, which is new to them. As a result of the interviews, we compiled the\nfollowing short list of tasks:\n\n1. Discover what and how parameters influence simulations within an ensemble.\n\n2. Verify which simulation conditions approximate from the nowadays conditions\n(from a geological point of view).\n\n3. Compare ensembles from different simulators.\n\n\n\n42\n\n4.2 GEVIs Architecture\n\nThe architecture of the system follows a common Web system architecture,\nwhere there are two layers: (i) a service layer and (ii) an application/view layer.\nThe service layer is responsible fro retrieving data from the data base, process it\nif needed, and then send it to the requester. The application/view layer is the\ngraphical user interface, which runs in the user machine. This section gives detail\nabout these two layers. Fig. 4.3 has a graphical vision which clarifies the GEVIs\narchitecture.\n\nFigure 4.3: A graphical vision of GEVIs architecture with how the user acts in the\nsystem and the processes occuring in the system.\n\n4.2.1 Service Layer\n\nThe service layer is characterized as a data provider. It can be described as\nhaving to parts: (i) the database and (ii) the data provider server.\n\nAt first, we modelled the simulation ensembles as a schema for a relational\ndata base to understand the relationships we would have within the data sets pro-\nvided by the simulator. The result of this modelling is in Fig. 4.4. The Ensemble\ntable has the list of ensembles available for visualization by the GEVis user. Simula-\ntionInfo is the list of all the simulations, and it tells to which ensemble a simulation\n\n\n\n43\n\nbelongs to. The CellTimeInfo table describes each cell in each time step for each\nsimulation. VariableInfo lists all variables that can be used by the simulations. Fi-\nnally, CellTimeInfo has VariableInfo represents the relation of CellTimeInfo and\nVariableInfo, in this case representing the value of a variable in a cell in a certain\ntime step.\n\nFigure 4.4: Relational schema for simulation ensembles\n\nAfter this first relational model, we modelled our data set as a NoSQL schema\nbecause we adopted MongoDB1 documents2 as data base. This NoSQm odeLl is\npresented in Fig. 4.5. In this model, an ensemble is a list of simulations and is\nrepresented as a document. Each variable is also treated as a document. The\nrelationship between variables and a cell in a time step of a simulation, which we\nmodeled in Fig.4.4 as the table CellTimeInfo has VariableInfo, we defined as a list\nof variable values in a MongoDB document.\n\nOur choice for a NoSQL schema is justified by the fact tha comparing both\nmodels, it was noticed a large amount of redundant data needed in the relational\ndata model for retrieving data, while in MongoDB, since it stores documents using\na similar concept of JSON files, there is less redundancy. We developed a parser to\nread the data from simulations results and store it in the MongoDB database.\n\nFor the data provider server, we used the concept of Web Services3 to com-\nmunicate the data to the application layer. It passes to the application layer:\n\n1<https://www.mongodb.com/>\n2MongoDB does not used the concept of table, but uses the concept of documents (see&lt;https:\n\n//docs.mongodb.com/>).\n3\"A Web service is a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine\n\ninteraction over a network.\"(W3C, 2004)\n\nhttps://www.mongodb.com/\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/\n\n\n44\n\nFigure 4.5: NoSQL (MongoDB) schema for simulation ensembles\n\n\u2022 Data about the ensembles\n\n\u2022 Variables in an ensemble\n\n\u2022 Cell quantity of the domain\n\n\u2022 Data values of a variable in a cell for all time steps\n\n\u2022 Data values of a variable in a certain time instant for each simulation in the\nwhole domain,\n\n\u2022 Data values of a set of variables in a certain cell and for a certain time instant.\n\nThe data provider server was developed using NodeJS4.\nIn the cases where the server needs to retrieve data from a specific time\n\ninstant, there is a problem to be solved. The time steps can be different between\ndifferent simulations, so a simulation might not have data values for a specific time\ninstant. Then, to obtain data related to a time instant from a simulation that does\noutput data with that time stamp, the server needs to provide interpolated data. We\nadopted cubic spline interpolation method (MCKINLEY; LEVINE, 1998), instead of\nother methods (Lagrange or Newton) because with higher order polynomial function\nwe would introduce unwanted oscillations in data values, which would likely be\nproducing inconsistencies in the values.\n\n4<https://nodejs.org/en/>\n\nhttps://nodejs.org/en/\n\n\n45\n\n4.2.2 Application Layer\n\nThe application layer corresponds to the software layer through which the\nuser interacts with the system. Our application, as a visualization application, has\nthe goal of helping users to understand phenomena or models by analyzing visual\nmetaphors representing the data. The 2D visualization techniques were implemented\nusing D35, the 3D visualization techniques was implemented using three.js6 and for\nthe window system it was used jQuery7. Our code is available online in GitHub8\n\nrepository in the url&lt;https://github.com/GJFeller/GEVIs>.\nThe application user interface (Fig.4.6) uses the concept of floating windows\n\nfor displaying the visual representations, so the user has a flexible way to place the\nvisualizations side by side, and \"physically\" linked by lines, and also uses the CMV\nconcept (Section 3.2.3.6) when the user interacts with a visualization technique,\nusing brushing and selection, it is reflected in the other views. This approach is\nbased on (DUNNE et al., 2012) and (CAVA, 2017). This windowed design is most\nhelpful in comparing different ensembles, and its flexibility also helps users to resize\nand relocate their visualizations depending on the course of data exploration.\n\nFigure 4.6: An overview of the window concept of GEVIs\n\nGEVIs first displays the ensembles available for visualization (upper left part\nof Fig.4.6), giving information about which simulations compose them. When an\n\n5<https://d3js.org/>\n6<https://threejs.org/>\n7<https://jquery.com/>\n8<https://github.com/>\n\nhttps://github.com/GJFeller/GEVIs\nhttps://d3js.org/\nhttps://threejs.org/\nhttps://jquery.com/\nhttps://github.com/\n\n\n46\n\nensemble is selected from this list, the user can interact with its variables to select\nthe features he/she wants to analyze (window named \"Variables Selection\").\n\nAn important concept of GEVIs is the division of the possible visualizations\ninto three groups: (i) temporal visualization, (ii) spatial domain visualization and\n(iii) multivariate visualization. Examples of these 3 visualizations are shown in\nFig. 4.6. The user selects these features to have different perspectives of the data.\nEach visualization technique has some interactive features, and the interaction with\na window is reflected in the other windows showing the same ensemble. In the\nfollowing sections, we give details about these coordinated visualization techniques.\n\n4.2.2.1 Temporal Visualization\n\nIn the temporal visualization, the user can understand how the variables be-\nhave along the simulated time, and interacting with the other visualizations, mainly\nthe multivariate visualization, she/he can understand how the parameters affect the\nsimulation in a certain cell.\n\nTo visualize how a variable behaves along time in different simulation runs,\nthe user can choose to represent them in a multiple series chart that can help users\nobserve how each simulation evolves. Each line in a chart corresponds to a simulation\nrun. If the user selects more than one variable, the charts are placed following a\ngrid layout (Fig. 4.7a. It was used because is what the users are used to, but in the\nfuture we want to test other techniques with them as an improvement of the system.\n\nIn the temporal visualization, the user can select a time instant, and other\nexisting views are updated with the values of variables at that time instant. If no\ntime instant is selected, values at time instant 0 are shown in the spatial domain\nvisualization, for example.\n\n4.2.2.2 Spatial Domain Visualization\n\nThe spatial domain of the simulation is an important, almost mandatory\ninformation to be displayed, because it represents how different lithotypes are dis-\ntributed across space, which may provide hints about how they affect the simulations\nbehavior. We adopted a 3D domain visualization even with 1D simulation domains.\nThe idea of using 3D to visualize such spatial domains is because geologists are used\nto interact with 3D representations of geological models.\n\n\n\n47\n\nFigure 4.7: Temporal and spatial domain visualization techniques.\n\n(a) Temporal visualization: multiple series\nchart showing the mineralization rate of an-\nhydrite, calcite and dolomite varying along\ntime\n\n(b) Spatial domain visualization showing a\n1D domain, color coded with the mineraliza-\ntion rate of anhydrite, calcite and dolomite\n\nIn the spatial domain view, we first show the division in cells, even the user\nhas not selected any variable to visualize. When the user selects a variable, the\ncells are displayed using colors that map the mean value of that variable for all\nthe simulations in a certain instant of time. Although displaying such approximate\nvalue does not have a meaning, we aimed to provide some hint about the behaviour\nof the variable along the whole simulation.\n\nBy default, when the user does not interact with the spatial domain view, the\nsystem considers the first cell as the selected cell (the cell marked by the arrow (see\nFig. 4.7b). As the user interacts and selects multiple cells, the other views display\nthe mean value for the variables in the selected cells.\n\nIn terms of visualization techniques, we used a simple grid visualization with\ncolor mapping the average values of all selected simulations for each cell because in\nthe simulator GUI development we used bar chart to represent the percentage of\nsolids in a mineralogy, but it was claimed that it can confuse geologist because it\ncan think about spatial domain, so if we used a spatial-temporal techniques (e.g.\nseparate the cells in time instants and give a color to each time instant representing\nthe average of the variable in the time instant for that cell) it may confuse them, so\nwe prefer to keep simple for the user.\n\nIn our system we have a technical limitation from the simulator which is\ntreating only rectilinear grids and only the 1D simulations are well concept, so in\nall the examples used we are going to use only rectilinear grids in 1D simulations,\nbut in the future we expect to improve with different.\n\n\n\n48\n\n4.2.2.3 Multivariate Visualization\n\nGEVis provides a multivariate visualization in the form of a scatter plot\nmatrix (Fig. 4.8) or parallel coordinates. Scatter plot matrix is useful for guessing\nabout possible correlation between variables. In the scatter plot matrix, each marker\nis a different simulation, while in parallel coordinates simulations are represented\nby lines. By default, it is shown to the user the scatter plot matrix, but using the\nconfiguration button in the window, they can change to parallel coordinates plot.\n\nBy default, all simulations are shown in this view, but by using brushing,\nthe user can select a subset of simulation runs, and the other views are update\naccordingly, showing only data values from the selected simulations.\n\nFigure 4.8: Scatter plot matrix showing the mineralization rate of anhydrite, calcite\nand dolomite of 25 simulations\n\n4.3 Remarks\n\nThe proof-of-concept prototype of GEVis provides visualization techniques\nfor supporting the three main tasks our users pointed out in the interviews.\n\nTo discover what and how parameters influence simulations within an en-\nsemble, the user can observe the temporal visualization comparing the variables\nbehavior along time for the different runs. Each simulation run may have different\nvalues for input parameters and the user can observe the behavior of the output\n\n\n\n49\n\nvalues of the selected variables.\nThe comparison of different ensembles can be performed in the same way.\n\nThe user just have to select simulation runs from different ensembles in the GEVis\nconfiguration panel.\n\nFinally, to verify which simulation conditions approximate the nowadays con-\nditions, from a geological point of view, the user has to select the appropriate vari-\nables related to minerals and visualize the last time instant.\n\n\n\n50\n\n5 CASE STUDY\n\nAlthough we provided light evidences that the users can perform their elicited\nhigh levels tasks with GEVis, in this chapter, we use synthetic simulations trying to\nprovide stronger evidences that our design is able to support users\u2019 tasks.\n\n5.1 Hypothetical Ensembles\n\nA problem we encountered in this work was to obtain real reservoir data that\nwould be necessary to build simulation cases. Usually, oil companies do not publicize\nreservoir data because they are of private interest, and finding (and compiling) such\ndata in the literature is a hard task and demands expert knowledge. To avoid\nany problems, we used hypothetical data which were used to help geologists to\nunderstand how changes in concentration affect simulations.\n\nOur hypothetical data set is composed by two simulations, and we considered\neach of these simulations candidates for being ensembles. Moreover, since they were\nbatch (0D) simulations, we also converted them to 1D by artificially extending the\nspatial domain.\n\nIn all the ensembles we varied the temperature between 25oC and 125oC\nand varied concentration of solute Mg++ from 0.0005 mol/L to 0.0009 mol/L. We\nconsidered a domain of 10 cells, each one with 10 m of thickness, in a depth of 1500\nm and a water inlet flux of 5cm/year, entering the same water composition. The\nmineralogy we used was the same for all simulations (Table 5.1).\n\nTable 5.1: Description of the mineralogy used for all simulations\nSolid Volume Fraction (%) Grain Diameter (mm)\n\nAnhydrite 15 0.01\nCalcite 40 0.01\nDolomite 10 0.01\n\nTable 5.2: Water composition used for all simulations of the first ensemble\nSolute Concentration (mol/L)\npH 7\n\nTotal C 0.01\nSO4?? 0.05\nMg++ 0.0005 to 0.0009\n\n\n\n51\n\nTable 5.3: Water composition used for all simulations of the second ensemble, chang-\ning the pH\n\nSolute Concentration (mol/L)\npH 6\n\nTotal C 0.01\nSO4?? 0.05\nMg++ 0.0005 to 0.0009\n\n5.2 First Task: Parameter Influence\n\nThe temperature has a great influence in the simulation results (as stated in\nSection 3.1.1), but the typical user does not know how the variation of Mg++ may\ninfluence the simulation. So, he can use the first ensemble for exploring this case.\n\nIn Fig. 5.1, one can visualize for Anhydrite, the greater the temperature,\nfaster is its dissolution. The same behavior we notice in calcite, but for dolomite it\nprecipitates more in higher temperature. To analyze better how the variation of con-\ncentration of Mg++ influences the simulation, one can select different temperature\nintervals in the multivariate visualization and analyze each plot (Fig. 5.2 and Fig.\n5.3). The user notices that for Anhydrite and for calcite in higher concentration of\nMg++, faster is their dissolution, and for dolomite as higher is this concentration,\nhigher it precipitates. This can be explained as follows: since dolomite reaction has\nMg++ to form it, a higher concentration of Mg++ accelerates dolomite formation,\nand it also uses the other solids in this process.\n\n5.3 Second Task: Verify Similarity with Nowadays Conditions\n\nOur typical geologist receives (from the lab) data about a probable condition\nin the past regarding solid composition and water condition. Since this is a guess,\nthe user needs to test it under different conditions to try to find stronger evidences\nabout how was the most probable conditions in the past for describing the rock\nformation in a certain area.\n\nSince our case is hypothetical, we can not actually use it to verify real con-\nditions. For example, consider the geologist is using these simulations as tests for\na more precise simulation. He simulates only 100 years, instead of thousands or\nmillion years. He expects the Anhydrite to precipitate instead of dissolve: he ob-\nserves that the trend in the first ensemble is wrong, so he needs to change another\n\n\n\n52\n\nFigure 5.1: Volume fraction of each solid (represented by one chart each) through\ntime for all simulations of the first ensemble\n\nFigure 5.2: Volume fraction of each solid (represented by one chart each) through\ntime for all simulations of the first ensemble selecting 25?C and 50?C\n\nparameter to try to reach the expected condition.\nThe user then analyzes the second ensemble which was run using different pH\n\nvalues. Analyzing Fig. 5.4, he observes that precipitation of Anhydrite is different\nfrom the first ensemble. He can assume that, in this case, the second ensemble is a\n\n\n\n53\n\nFigure 5.3: Volume fraction of each solid (represented by one chart each) through\ntime for all simulations of the first ensemble selecting 75?C to 125?C\n\nstrong candidate for describing the conditions needed for a more precise simulation.\n\nFigure 5.4: Volume fraction of each solid (represented by one chart each) through\ntime for all simulations of the second ensemble\n\n\n\n54\n\n5.4 Third Task: Comparing Ensembles\n\nNow, we consider that the user wants to compare both ensembles to un-\nderstand, for example, why the pH 6 simulation runs had the different behavior\npresented in Section 5.3. The user may want to compare them side by side. The\nwindowed design of the application allows it in a easy way (as in Fig. 5.5). The\nuser can visualize one run at a time, but this requires a large cognitive effort and\nmore steps to finally compare them (for example, printing the window).\n\nIn this example, the user can analyze that the lower pH value increases the\nsaturation of Anhydrite and decreases the saturation of dolomite. So, this way the\nuser can say Anhydrite is using some solutes dolomite was expected to use, slowing\ndolomite precipitation (in reactions, they both share solutes based on Carbon).\n\nFigure 5.5: Comparing the saturation of each solid (represented by one chart each)\nthrough time of both ensembles\n\n\n\n55\n\n6 EVALUATION WITH EXPERT USERS\n\nWhile in the previous chapter we developed a case study to show the use of\nour tool in scenarios related to the users\u2019 tasks that we gathered from interviews\nwith users, in this chapter we present an evaluation we conducted with four expert\nusers. Two of them were interviewed in the beginning of the work.\n\n6.1 Evaluation Process Design\n\nWe invited four subjects for using GEVIs in typical analysis tasks. Three\nof them have a B.Sc. degree in Geology: User1 and User2 have PhD degrees and\nUser3 has a MSc deegree. User1 is also an expert in Geochemistry, with experience\nin developing geochemical simulators. User2 and User3 have experience in using\ngeological computational tools. User4 has a BSC degree in Chemistry and a PhD in\nGeology, and has experience in using geological tools and geochemical simulators.\nAll users experimented GEVIs with the ensembles explained in section 5.1.\n\nAll users, except User4, performed the evaluation in the same room and with\nthe same computer, one at a time. User4 did the experiment remotely since GEVIs\nis a web-based application.\n\nEach user was invited to first read about how the ensembles were created\nand their mineralogy and water composition. After, they were allowed to use the\nsystem freely to evaluate also if the tasks provided through the informal interview\n(as explicited in section 4.1.2) are really important to them and if they can be\nachieved. Since currently they have different activity profiles, they may want to\nvisualize different aspects of the data. For example, geologists concentrate more\non understanding solid data, while geochemists concentrate also in understanding\nthe solutes relation with solid precipitation and dissolution). In average, the users\nspent 30 minutes using the system. We did not recorded their interactions with the\nsystem, because we thought using something to record their actions would increase\ntheir stress using the system, and it could bias the evaluation.\n\nAfter the use of GEVIs, the expert users answered two questionnaires: (i)\na System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire (BROOKE et al., 1996) (Table B.1)\nand (ii) a questionnaire evaluating the tasks they can perform with the system and\nthe visualization techniques (Table B.2). In all questionnaires, expect Q6 and Q7\n\n\n\n56\n\nin the second questionnaire, use Likert scale (LIKERT, 1932) for the answers, with\n1 being \"Strongly disagree\", and 5 \"Strongly agree\". Questions Q6 and Q7 asked\nfor a textual answer. We used the SUS questionnaire as a metric to define the\nusability of the system and the specific questionnaire to evaluate the tasks the users\ncould perform in the system and also evaluate the visualization techniques used.\nThese two questionnaires can be related to help to understand in which tasks we\ncan improve usability to make the task more accessible to the user.\n\n6.2 Evaluation Results\n\nIn this section we are going to discuss the results of the evaluation for each\nquestionnaire. As the order the subjects answered in the evaluation questionnaire,\nfirst we are going to discuss the SUS questionnaire results and then the system\nspecific questionnaire results.\n\n6.2.1 SUS Results\n\nTo obtain the SUS score, we calculated the individual score for each one of\nthe 4 subjects, and after we calculated the average of all subjects. The answers of\nall subjects for each SUS question is shown on Fig. 6.1, and the SUS score of all the\nsubjects is in Fig. 6.2.\n\nTo evaluate the quality of system, we adopted Bangor\u2019s ratings (BANGOR;\nKORTUM; MILLER, 2009). The average SUS score of all subject was 70,625, while\nthe minimum score was 57.5 and the maximum score was 90. According to Table\n6.1, this average is in the Good category (considering we are above the standard\ndeviation of Ok and in the standard deviation of Good), but below the average of\nGood by little. We interpret this result as a good result of our work, because data\nto be visualized is complex and the users had very few time to get acquainted with\nthe system. Another aspect we can consider positive is that the minimum score we\nobtained was Ok, and the maximum score was an Excellent.\n\nAnalyzing individually the results of each question, we observe answers for\nSUS2 (\"I found the system unnecessarily complex.\") SUS3 (\"I thought the system\nwas easy to use\"), which are related to the complexity and the easy of use of the\n\n\n\n57\n\nFigure 6.1: Chart showing the answers of all users in the SUS questionnaire\n\nFigure 6.2: Chart showing the SUS score of each subject\n\nsystem, respectively. There are some negative aspects shown by the answers, which\nneed further evaluation to verify if the difficulties of the users were from the data\nitself or from some design mistake. For questions SUS7 (\"I would imagine that most\npeople would learn to use this system very quickly\") and SUS10 (\"I needed to learn\na lot of things before I could get going with this system\"), regarding learnability,\nGEVIs obtained a Good result, but there is also a need to evaluate if these answers\n\n\n\n58\n\nTable 6.1: SUS Score for the Adjective Ratings as in (BANGOR; KORTUM;\nMILLER, 2009)\n\nAdjective Mean SUS Score Standard Deviation\nWorst Imaginable 12.5 13.1\n\nAwful 20.3 11.3\nPoor 35.7 12.6\nOK 50.9 13.8\nGood 71.4 11.6\n\nExcellent 85.5 10.4\nBest Imaginable 90.9 13.4\n\ncome from what a user need to learn to understand the data or if the user interface\ndoes not help the users to use it, even though their are experts in the application\ndomain.\n\n6.2.2 System Specific Questionnaire\n\nThe main purpose of this questionnaire was to get a feedback from users re-\ngarding if they think they would be able to perform their tasks of analyzing the en-\nsembles with the system. We also aimed at evaluating if the visualization techniques\nhelped them to understand the simulations. The questions of this questionnaire are\nshown in Table B.2.\n\nAnalyzing the answers (Fig. 6.3), we observe a huge disparity in Q2 (\"I think I\ncan find out what are the simulations that approximate the expected results\"). This\ncan be a consequence of not using real data, so we do not have expected results,\nbut expected behavior. We need to study how we can, visually, help the users to\nfind the expected results or behavior (e.g. creating a filter of expected values or if a\nsolid precipitates or dissolves) in order to reduce this probable problem.\n\nIn Q1 (\"I think I can find out the influence of some characteristics in the\nsimulations\"), we have some disparity in answers: it was commented that the system\nis very good to visualize how varying one parameter can influence the simulations,\nvarying two parameters is Ok, but varying three may be difficult, so we need to\nimprove this kind of visualization. One possibility is separating the simulations in\ngroups by the variable value and visualizing the aggregation of simulations using\nthis value.\n\nQ5 (\"I think the proposed visualization techniques are enough to visualize\n\n\n\n59\n\nFigure 6.3: Chart showing the answers of all users in the system specific question-\nnaire\n\nthe results\") reflects the situation that some visualization techniques are missed by\nusers in the system. They commented two aspects to improve in the visualizations:\n\n1. Comparing the same variable (e.g. saturation) for different minerals in the\nsame plot and\n\n2. Finding some visual metaphor to understand the mineralogy as all in time and\nspace.\n\nFor the first aspect, we can use the idea of merging plots by dragging one\ninto another. For second one, this was suggested as future work.\n\n6.3 Final Remarks\n\nThis chapter described the evaluation of GEVis by expert users. Although a\nprevious tool (DiagenViz) was developed considering suggestions from expert users,\nand this work was built based on that experience, GEVis aims at helping the analysis\nand visualization of simulation ensembles, where the data sets are larger and more\ncomplex than in previous work. Along the case study and the experiments performed\nby users, we collected several suggestions and ideas for improvements, which we will\ndiscuss in the next section.\n\n\n\n60\n\nSince User4 tested remotely and we do not put an analyzer of user actions in\nthe system, we do not have information about its use, just the results. But User1\ntested the system for about 1 hour, User2 tested for about 15 minutes and User3\ntested for about 30 minutes. Other thing to consider is talking with them after\nthe test and their answer to the questionnaire, they said the system was good, has\nsome minor problems (bugs and some features they thought interesting but it was\navailable to use) but it has an huge potential to be used in the future.\n\n\n\n61\n\n7 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS\n\nVisualization of simulations ensembles is a complex problem, due mainly to\nthe complexity of data, considering that they are multidimensional, time evolutive,\nmultivariate and multivalued. Providing methods to help users to explore such data,\nand make it easier the understanding of the several facets data might have, is still\na big challenge. We addressed the specific problem of ensembles of geochemical\nsimulations results.\n\nFirst we researched about how other geochemical simulation systems deal\nwith visualization and we developed, as a previous work, an user interface to visualize\nsingle geochemical simulation. Then we researched about visualization of multiple\nsimulation results to figure how we could solve the problem of visualizing multiple\ngeochemical simulations. We used SLR method to review the works in the area.\n\nWe designed a system to visualize these ensembles, based on a windowed\ndesign to make it flexible for the user to place the visualizations in the workspace and\ninteract with them, using what we found in the SLR we made with self experience\nfrom previous work. We evaluated our system based on two methods: a case study,\nwhere we analyzed user tasks and discussed how a user would accomplish such\ntasks with our tool, and an experiment with four expert users. In this experiment,\nthey found the system adequate for use, but pointed out that it still needs some\nrefinements for achieving the status of a good or excellent system.\n\nAs a suggestion, GEVis can be used in two situations: (i) to learn about\ngeochemistry, like how some solute concentration influences solid saturation, and\n(ii) to find out the conditions in which reservoirs are formed along the years.\n\nRegarding immediate future work, we need to analyze again the results from\nthe experiments performed by the expert users for improving the current prototype.\nNext, we need to test other visualization and analysis techniques, like dimensional\nreduction techniques. These would help users to understand in a faster way how\nvariables in an ensemble correlates to each other, and would also help them to\nunderstand common behaviors across different simulations.\n\nAs a subsequent work, we would like to apply machine learning methods to\nfacilitate user tasks in terms of visual feedback and data processing.\n\n\n\n62\n\nREFERENCES\n\nALABI, O.
